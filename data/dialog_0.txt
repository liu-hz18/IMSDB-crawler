RIDER: Hey sorry .
KAT: Leave it
BIANCA: Did you change your hair ?
CHASTITY: No .
BIANCA: You might wan na think about it
BOY: Hey , Bianca .
GIRL: Awesome shoes .
MISS PERKY: I 'm sure you wo n't find Padua any different than your old school . Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere .
CAMERON: I do n't think so , ma'am
MISS PERKY: Then go forth . Scoot I 've got deviants to see .
PATRICK: I missed you .
MISS PERKY: It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls .
PATRICK: It was a bratwurst . I was eating lunch .
MISS PERKY: With the teeth of your zipper ?
MICHAEL: You the new guy ?
CAMERON: So they tell me
MICHAEL: C'mon . I 'm supposed to give you the tour .
CAMERON: North , actually . How 'd you ?
MICHAEL: I was kidding . People actually live there ?
CAMERON: Yeah . A couple . We 're outnumbered by the cows , though .
MICHAEL: How many people were in your old school ?
CAMERON: Thirty-two .
MICHAEL: Get out !
CAMERON: How many people go here ?
MICHAEL: Couple thousand . Most of them evil
CAMERON: That I 'm used to .
MICHAEL: Yeah , but these guys have never seen a horse . They just jack off to Clint Eastwood .
DEREK: Michael , my brother , peace
CAMERON: So where do you fit in all this ?
MICHAEL: Future MBAs- We 're all Ivy League , already accepted . Someday I 'll be sipping Merlot while those guys
CAMERON: That girl I
MICHAEL: You burn , you pine , you perish ?
CAMERON: Who is she ?
MICHAEL: Bianca Stratford . Sophomore . Do n't even think about it
CAMERON: Why not ?
MICHAEL: I could start with your haircut , but it does n't matter . She 's not allowed to date until her older sister does . And that 's an impossibility .
MRS. BLAISE: Well , then . Oh , yes . I guess that does it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea . Any other comments ? Kat ?
KAT: Why did n't we just read the Hardy Boys ?
MRS. BLAISE: I 'm sorry ?
KAT: This book is about a guy and his fishing habit . Not exactly a crucial topic .
JOEY: As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends ?
MRS. BLAISE: That 's enough , Mr. Dorsey .
KAT: I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway 's male and an asshole , he 's worthy of our time
PATRICK: Mother Goose ?
MISS PERKY: Katarina Stratford . My , my . You 've een terrorizing Ms. Blaise again .
KAT: Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action .
MISS PERKY: Well , yes , compared to your othe choices of expression this year , today 's events are quite mild . By the way , Bobby Rictor 's gonad retrieval operation went quite well , in case you 're interested .
KAT: I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls . I was merely a spectator .
MISS PERKY: The point is Kat people perceive you as somewhat
KAT: Tempestuous ?
MISS PERKY: No I believe `` heinous bitch '' is the term used most often .
KAT: As always , thank you for your excellent guidance .
BIANCA: Not really .
TEACHER: Mandella since you 're assisting us , you might as well comment . I 'm assuming you read the assignment .
MANDELLA: Uh , yeah , I read it all
TEACHER: The whole play^
MANDELIA: The whole folio . All the plays .
TEACHER: You 've read every play by William Shakespeare ?
MANDELLA: Have n't you ?
KAT: The fact that you 're cutting gym so you can T.A . Sophomore English just to hea his name , is a little without in itself if you ask me .
MANDELLA: Who 's that ?
KAT: Patrick Verona Random skid .
MANDELLA: That 's Pat Verona ? The one who was gone for a year ? I heard he was doing porn movies .
KAT: I 'm sure he 's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting .
MANDELLA: He always look so
KAT: Block E ?
MANDELLA: Just a little .
KAT: What 's this ?
MANDELLA: An attempted slit .
KAT: I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking , but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions . You 're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy .
MANDELLA: But imagine the things he 'd say during sex .
KAT: Okay , say you do it . You kill yourself , you end up in wherever you end up and he 's there . Do you really think he 's gon na wan na dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball ?
COHORT: Virgin alert .
JOEY: Lookin ' good , ladies .
MANDELLA: Tragic .
CAMERON: Why do girls like that always like guys like that ?
MICHAEL: Because they 're bred to . Their mothers liked guys like that , and thei grandmothers before them . Their gene pool is rarely diluted .
CAMERON: He always have that shit-eating grin ?
MICHAEL: Joey Dorsey ? Perma-shit-grin . I wish I could say he 's a moron , but he 's number twelve in the class . And a model . Mostly regional stuff , but he 's umored to have a big tube sock ad coming out .
CAMERON: Sure do my Mom 's from Canada
MICHAEL: Guess who just signed up for a tutor ?
CAMERON: You mean I 'd get a chance to talk to her ?
MICHAEL: You could consecrate with her , my friend .
JOEY: The vintage look is over , Kat . Have n't you been reading your Sassy ?
KAT: Yeah , and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow . Tough break .
JOEY: They 're running the rest of me next month .
KAT: The people at this school are so incredibly foul .
MANDELLA: You could always go with me . I 'm sure William has some friends .
JOEY: Need a ride , ladies ?
MANDELLA: That 's a charming new development
KAT: Remove head from sphincter ! Then pedal !
CAMERON: You all right ?
MICHAEL: Yeah , just a minor encounter with the shrew .
CAMERON: That 's her ? Bianca 's sister ?
MICHAEL: The mewling , rampalian wretch herself .
KAT: `` Undulating with desire , Adrienne emoves her crimson cape , revealing he creamy ``
SHARON: In the microwave .
WALTER: Make anyone cry today ?
KAT: Sadly , no . But it 's only four-thirty .
BIANCA: Nowhere Hi , Daddy .
WALTER: Hello , precious .
KAT: How touching .
WALTER: What 's this ? It says Sarah Lawrence ?
KAT: I guess I got in
SHARON: What 's a synonym for throbbing ?
WALTER: Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country .
KAT: I know .
WALTER: I thought we decided you were going to school here . At U of 0 .
KAT: You decided .
BIANCA: Is there even a question that we want her to stay ?
KAT: Ask Bianca who drove her home
SHARON: Swollenturgid .
WALTER: Who drove you home ?
BIANCA: Now do n't get upset . Daddy , but there 's this boy and I think he might ask
WALTER: No ! You 're not dating until your siste starts dating . End of discussion .
BIANCA: What if she never starts dating ?
WALTER: Then neither will you . And I 'll get to sleep at night .
BIANCA: But it 's not fair she 's a mutant , Daddy !
KAT: This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips ?
WALTER: Enough !
BIANCA: But she does n't want to date .
WALTER: Exactly my point
SHARON: Tumescent !
WALTER: You 're not helping .
BIANCA: Can we make this quick ? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad . Again .
CAMERON: Well , I thought we 'd start with pronunciation , if that 's okay with you .
CAMERON: Okay then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine . Saturday ? Night ?
BIANCA: You 're asking me out . That 's so cute . What 's your name again ?
CAMERON: Forget it .
BIANCA: No , no , it 's my fault we did n't have a proper introduction -
CAMERON: Cameron .
BIANCA: The thing is , Cameron I 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser . My sister . I ca n't date until she does .
CAMERON: Seems like she could get a date easy enough
CAMERON: Why ?
BIANCA: Unsolved mystery . She used to be eally popular when she started high school , then it was just like she got sick of it or something .
CAMERON: That 's a shame .
BIANCA: Gosh , if only we could find Kat a oyfriend
CAMERON: Let me see what I can do .
MICHAEL: You 're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl ? Do you have no concept of the high school social code ?
CAMERON: I teach her French , get to know her , dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me .
MICHAEL: Unlikely , but even so , she still ca n't go out with you . So what 's the point ?
CAMERON: What about him ?
MICHAEL: You wan na go out with him ?
CAMERON: No - he could wrangle with the sister .
MICHAEL: What makes you think he 'll do it ?
CAMERON: He seems like he thrives on dange
MICHAEL: No kidding . He 's a criminal . I heard he lit a state trooper on fire . He just got out of Alcatraz
CAMERON: They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology ?
MICHAEL: I 'm serious , man , he 's whacked . He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers .
CAMERON: Forget his reputation . Do you think we 've got a plan or not ?
MICHAEL: Did she actually say she 'd go out with you ?
CAMERON: That 's what I just said
MICHAEL: You know , if you do go out with Bianca , you 'd be set . You 'd outrank everyone . Strictly A-list . With me by your side .
CAMERON: I thought you hated those people .
MICHAEL: Hey I 've got ta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street .
CAMERON: So now all we got ta do is talk to him .
MICHAEL: I 'll let you handle that .
PEPE: Some people like the Colombian , but it all depends on your acidity preference . Me ? I prefer East African and Indonesian . You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup , you 're that much farther ahead than someone drinkin ' Cosia Rican or Kona you know what I mean ?
CAMERON: Hey , there
MICHAEL: Hey .
JOEY: Are you lost ?
MICHAEL: Nope - just came by to chat
JOEY: We do n't chat .
MICHAEL: Well , actually , I thought I 'd run an idea by you . You know , just to see if you 're interested .
JOEY: We 're not .
MICHAEL: Hear me out . You want Bianca do n't you ?
JOEY: Does this conversation have a purpose ?
MICHAEL: So what you need to do is recruit a guy who 'll go out with her . Someone who 's up for the job .
MICHAEL: Exactly
MICHAEL: Oh , hey , nothin ' man Purely good will on my part .
CAMERON: You got him involved ?
MICHAEL: Like we had a choice ? Besides when you let the enemy think he 's orchestrating the battle , you 're in a position of power . We let him pretend he 's calling the shots , and while he 's usy setting up the plan , you have time to woo Bianca .
CAMERON: You 're one brilliant guy
KAT: So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated , puking frat boy , number one golf team school . I have no say at all .
MANDELLA: William would never have gone to a state school .
KAT: William did n't even go to high school
MANDELLA: That 's never been proven
KAT: Neither has his heterosexuality .
MANDELLA: Does it matter ?
KAT: If I was Bianca , it would be , `` Any school you want , precious . Do n't forget your tiara . ''
MANDELLA: Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson .
KAT: Janice Parker is an idiot
MISS PERKY: I do n't understand , Patrick . You have n't done anything asinine this week . Are you not feeling well ?
PATRICK: Touch of the flu .
MISS PERKY: I 'm at a loss , then . What should we talk about ? Your year of absence ?
PATRICK: How 'bout your sex life ?
MISS PERKY: Why do n't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid ?
PATRICK: What 's to discuss ?
MISS PERKY: You were n't abused , you are n't stupid , and as far as I can tell , you 're only slightly psychotic so why is it that you 're such a fuck-up ?
PATRICK: Well , you know there 's the prestige of the job title and the benefits package is pretty good
MISS PERKY: Fine . Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week .
MANDELLA: Look , it 's really easy .
TREVOR: You 're a freedom fighter . Be proud , sister .
MANDELLA: It 's Mandella with two L 's . I am not elated to Nelson Mandela . I am not a political figure . I do not live in South Africa . My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries .
TREVOR: But you freed our people
MANDELLA: Your `` people '' are white , suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp . I have not freed you , Trevor . Only you can free yourself .
BIANCA: C'esc ma tete . This is my head
CAMERON: Right . See ? You 're ready for the quiz .
BIANCA: I do n't want to know how to say that though . I want to know useful things . Like where the good stores are . How much does champagne cost ? Stuff like Chat . I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone .
CAMERON: That 's because it 's such a nice one .
BIANCA: Forget French .
CAMERON: Well , there 's someone I think might be
BIANCA: Show me
CAMERON: There .
BIANCA: Where ?
CAMERON: I guess he did n't see me Some other time
BIANCA: My God , he 's repulsive . He 's so perfect !
PATRICK: What ?
JOEY: What do you think ?
PATRICK: Two legs , nice rack
JOEY: Yeah , whatever . I want you to go out with her .
PATRICK: Sure , Sparky . I 'll get right on it .
JOEY: You just said
PATRICK: You need money to take a girl out
JOEY: But you 'd go out with her if you had the cake ?
PATRICK: Yeah , I 'd take her to Europe if I had the plane .
JOEY: You got it , Verona . I pick up the tab , you do the honors .
PATRICK: You 're gon na pay me to take out some girl ?
JOEY: I ca n't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend . And that 's the catch . She does n't want a boyfriend .
PATRICK: How much ?
PATRICK: I ca n't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks .
JOEY: Fine , thirty .
PATRICK: Fifty , and you 've got your man .
MR. CHAPIN: Good run , Stratford .
PATRICK: Hey . Girlie .
KAT: Sweating like a pig , actually . And yourself ?
PATRICK: There 's a way to get a guy 's attention .
KAT: My mission in life .
PATRICK: Pick you up Friday , then
KAT: Oh , right . Friday .
PATRICK: The night I take you to places you 've never been before . And back .
KAT: Like where ? The 7-Eleven on Burnside ? Do you even know my name , screwboy ?
PATRICK: I know a lot more than that
KAT: Doubtful . Very doubtful .
PATRICK: You 're no bargain either , sweetheart .
SCURVY: So I guess the Jeep wo n't be getting a new Blaupunkt .
MICHAEL: He took the bait .
BIANCA: Have you ever considered a new look ? I mean , seriously , you could have some potential buried under all this hostility .
KAT: I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you do n't get out of my way .
BIANCA: Can you at least start wearing a bra ?
PATRICK: Hey
KAT: I do n't really think you warrant that strong an emotion .
PATRICK: Then say you 'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me .
KAT: And why would I do that ?
PATRICK: Come on the ponies , the flat beer , you with money in your eyes , me with my hand on your ass
KAT: You covered in my vomit .
PATRICK: Seven-thirty ?
KAT: Are you following me ?
PATRICK: I was in the laundromat . I saw you car . Thought I 'd say hi .
KAT: Hi
PATRICK: You 're not a big talker , are you ?
KAT: Depends on the topic . My fenders do n't eally whip me into a verbal frenzy .
JOEY: Not at all
WALTER: My insurance does not cover PMS
KAT: Then tell them I had a seizure .
WALTER: Is this about Sarah Lawrence ? You punishing me ?
KAT: I thought you were punishing me .
WALTER: Why ca n't we agree on this ?
KAT: Because you 're making decisions for me .
WALTER: As a parent , that 's my right
KAT: So what I want does n't matter ?
WALTER: You 're eighteen . You do n't know what you want . You wo n't know until you 're forty-five and you do n't have it .
KAT: I want to go to an East Coast school ! I want you to trust me to make my own choices . I want
WALTER: Christ ! I want a night to go by that I 'm not staring a contraction in the face .
JOEY: When I shell out fifty , I expect esults .
PATRICK: I 'm on it
JOEY: Watching the bitch trash my car does n't count as a date .
PATRICK: I got her under control . She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image .
JOEY: Let me put it to you this way , if you do n't get any action , I do n't get any action . So get your ass on hers by the end of the week .
PATRICK: I just upped my price
JOEY: What ?
PATRICK: A hundred bucks a date .
JOEY: Forget it .
PATRICK: Forget her sister , then .
JOEY: You better hope you 're as smooth as you think you are , Verona .
CAMERON: La copine et I 'ami ? La diferance ?
BIANCA: A `` copine '' is someone you can count on . An `` ami '' is someone who makes promises he ca n't keep .
CAMERON: You got something on your mind ?
BIANCA: I counted on you to help my cause . You and that thug are obviously failing . Are n't we ever going on our date ?
CAMERON: You have my word . As a gentleman
BIANCA: You 're sweet .
CAMERON: How do you get your hair to look like that ?
BIANCA: Eber 's Deep Conditioner every two days . And I never , ever use a blowdrye without the diffuser attachment .
CAMERON: You know , I read an article about that .
BIANCA: You did ?
PATRICK: Say it
MICHAEL: What ?
PATRICK: Whatever the hell it is you 're standin ' there waitin ' to say .
CAMERON: We wanted to talk to you about the plan .
PATRICK: What plan ?
MICHAEL: The situation is , my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford .
PATRICK: What is it with this chick ? She have three tits ?
MICHAEL: I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron 's love is pure . Purer than say Joey Dorsey 's .
PATRICK: Dorsey can plow whoever he wants . I 'm just in this for the cash .
MICHAEL: That 's where we can help you . With Kat .
PATRICK: So Dorsey can get the girl ?
MICHAEL: Patrick , Pat , you 're not looking at the ig picture . Joey 's just a pawn . We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl .
PATRICK: You two are gon na help me tame the wild east ?
MICHAEL: We 're your guys .
CAMERON: And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way .
PATRICK: Yeah we 'll see .
MICHAEL: We 're in .
CAMERON: This is it . A golden opportunity . Patrick can ask Katarina to the party .
MICHAEL: In that case , we 'll need to make it a school-wide blow out .
CAMERON: Will Bogey get bent ?
MICHAEL: Are you kidding ? He 'll piss himself with joy . He 's the ultimate kiss ass .
JOEY: Which do you like better ?
BIANCA: I think I like the white shirt
JOEY: It 's more
BIANCA: Expensive ?
JOEY: Exactly So , you going to Bogey Lowenbrau 's thing on Saturday ?
BIANCA: Hopefully .
JOEY: Good , 'cause I 'm not gon na bother if you wo n't be there .
BIANCA: Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein 's party ?
CAMERON: Sure have .
BIANCA: I really , really , really wan na go , but I ca n't . Not unless my sister goes .
CAMERON: I 'm workin ' on it . But she does n't seem to be goin ' for him .
BIANCA: Lesbian ? No . I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers , so I 'm pretty sure she 's not harboring same-sex tendencies .
CAMERON: So that 's the kind of guy she likes ? Pretty ones ?
BIANCA: Who knows ? All I 've ever heard her say is that she 'd dip before dating a guy that smokes .
CAMERON: All right . What else is she partial to ?
PATRICK: Lou , it 's okay . They 're with me .
CAMERON: I 've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you 'll find helpful .
PATRICK: What ? !
MICHAEL: Good enough .
CAMERON: Number one . She hates smokers
MICHAEL: It 's a lung cancer issue
CAMERON: Her favorite uncle
MICHAEL: Dead at forty-one .
PATRICK: Are you telling me I 'm a - `` non-smoker '' ?
MICHAEL: Just for now .
CAMERON: Another thing . Bianca said that Kat likes pretty guys .
PATRICK: What ? You do n't think I 'm pretty ?
MICHAEL: He 's pretty !
CAMERON: Okay ! I was n't sure
PATRICK: So what does that give me ? I 'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a ook and sit around listening to chicks who ca n't play their instruments ?
MICHAEL: Ever been to Club Skunk ?
PATRICK: Yeah .
CAMERON: Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night .
PATRICK: Do n't make me do it , man
MICHAEL: Assail your ears for one night .
CAMERON: It 's her favorite band .
MICHAEL: I also retrieved a list of her most ecent CD purchases , courtesy of American Express .
PATRICK: Michael did you get this information `` illegally '' ?
MICHAEL: I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows .
PATRICK: I 'm likin ' you guys bette
BIANCA: Can you turn down the Screaming Menstrual Bitches ? I 'm trying to study .
KAT: It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we 're going .
BIANCA: Oh , I thought you might have a date I do n't know why I 'm bothering to ask , ut are you going to Bogey Lowenstein 's party Saturday night ?
KAT: What do you think ?
BIANCA: I think you 're a freak . I think you do this to torture me . And I think you suck .
KAT: Let 's hit it .
MANDELLA: You think this 'll work ?
KAT: No fear .
BRUCE: I can count .
MANDELLA: I 'll bet you can..
BRUCE: Go ahead . And you
MANDELLA: Yes ?
BRUCE: Take it easy on the guys in there .
SKIPPY: It 's a bottle opener .
BRUCE: Verona , my man .
PATRICK: Always a pleasure , Brucie .
BRUCE: Did n't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan . Are n't they a little too pre-teen elly-button ring for you ?
PATRICK: Fan of a fan . You see a couple of minors come in ?
BRUCE: Neve
PATRICK: Padua girls . One tall , decent body . The other one kinda short and undersexed ?
BRUCE: Just sent 'em through .
LEAD SINGER: Hello , out there . We 're Gigglepuss and we 're from Olympia .
KAT: I need agua !
BARTENDER: What can I get you ?
KAT: Two waters .
PATRICK: hey . Great show , huh ?
PATRICK: Excuse me ?
KAT: That 's what you want , is n't it ?
PATRICK: Do you mind ? You 're sort of ruining it for me .
KAT: You 're not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke .
PATRICK: I know . I quit .
KAT: Oh , really ?
PATRICK: You know , these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats , but they 're right up there .
KAT: You know who The Raincoats are ?
PATRICK: Why , do n't you ?
KAT: What ?
BARTENDER: You forgot to pay !
PATRICK: I got it , Rick .
MANDELLA: What 'd he say ?
KAT: Who cares ?
MANDELLA: Has he importun 'd you with love in honourable fashion ?
KAT: Gigglepuss was so beyond .
MANDELLA: They were . I only wish William could have been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us .
KAT: So true .
CAMERON: So , then she says that she almost did n't wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought she was mixing , you know , genres . And the fact that I noticed and I 'm quoting here - `` really meant something . ''
MICHAEL: You told me that part already .
CAMERON: Hell , I 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
JOEY: Hey . Dingo Boingo
MICHAEL: Uh , yeah . We 're old friend*
JOEY: You and Verona ?
MICHAEL: What ? We took bathes together when we were kids .
JOEY: What 's your gig in all this ?
CAMERON: I 'm just the new guy .
JOEY: You better not fuck this up . I 'm heavily invested .
MICHAEL: Hey it 's all for the higher good ight ?
CAMERON: Is it about me ?
MISS PERKY: You 're completely demented .
PATRICK: See you next week !
MISS PERKY: You two know each other ?
BIANCA: She 's obviously not going .
WALTER: And where 're you going ?
BIANCA: If you must know , we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends .
WALTER: Otherwise known as an orgy ?
BIANCA: It 's just a party . Daddy , but I knew you 'd forbid me to go since `` Gloria Steinem '' over there is n't going
WALTER: Do you know about any party ? Katarina ?
BIANCA: Daddy , people expect me to be there !
WALTER: If Kat 's not going , you 're not going .
BIANCA: You 're ruining my life ' Because you wo n't be normal , I ca n't be normal .
KAT: What 's normal ?
BIANCA: Bogey Lowenstein 's party is normal , but you 're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that .
WALTER: What 's a Bogey Lowenstein ?
BIANCA: Ca n't you forget for just one night that you 're completely wretched ?
KAT: At least I 'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig .
BIANCA: Like I 'm supposed to know what that even means .
KAT: It 's Shakespeare . Maybe you 've heard of him ?
BIANCA: Yeah , he 's your freak friend Mandella 's oyfriend . I guess since I 'm not allowed to go out , I should obsess ove a dead guy , too .
WALTER: Girls
KAT: I know about the goddamn party . I 'm going .
WALTER: Oh , God . It 's starting .
BIANCA: It 's just a party . Daddy .
WALTER: Wear the belly before you go .
BIANCA: Daddy , no !
WALTER: Just for a minute
BIANCA: You are so completely unbalanced .
KAT: Can we go now ? Scanned by http //freemoviescripts.com
WALTER: Promise me you wo n't talk to any boys unless your sister is present .
BIANCA: Why ?
WALTER: Because she 'll scare them away .
PATRICK: Nine-thirty right ?
KAT: I 'm driving .
PATRICK: Who knocked up your sister ?
BOGEY: Nice to see you . Martini bar to the ight , shots in the kitchen .
JOEY: Lookin ' fresh tonight , Pussy-Kat
KAT: Wait was that ? Did your hairline just recede ?
JOEY: Where ya goin ?
KAT: Away .
JOEY: Your sister here ?
KAT: Leave my sister alone .
JOEY: And why would I do that ?
JOCK: A fight !
JOEY: Just who I was looking for .
KAT: BIANCA
GUY: Drink up , sister .
PATRICK: What 's this ?
KAT: `` I 'm getting trashed , man . '' Is n't that what you 're supposed to do at a party ?
PATRICK: I say , do what you wan na do .
KAT: Funny , you 're the only one
MICHAEL: Moose , my man ! Ranked fifth in the state . Recruiters have already started calling .
BIANCA: Where did he go ? He was just here .

CHASTITY: Great
BIANCA: Would you mind getting me a drink , Cameron ?
CAMERON: Certainly Pabst ? Old Milwaukee ? RaiJieer ?
BIANCA: Surprise me .
MICHAEL: Extremely unfortunate maneuver .
CAMERON: The hell is that ? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries he away while you 're talking to her ?
MICHAEL: Buttholus extremus . But hey , you 're making progress .
CAMERON: No , I ' m not .
MICHAEL: At least you 're self-aware
JOEY: So yeah , I 've got the Sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig `` that 's gon na be huge . And then I 'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week .
BIANCA: Queen Harry ?
JOEY: It 's a gay cruise line , but I 'll be , like , wearing a uniform and stuff .
BIANCA: Neat
JOEY: My agent says I 've got a good shot at eing the Prada guy next year .
BIANCA: I 'll be right back .
CHASTITY: Is he oily or dry ?
BIANCA: Combination . I do n't know I thought he 'd be different . More of a gentleman
CHASTITY: Bianca , I do n't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding .
BIANCA: Sometimes I wonder if the guys we 're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with , you know ?
CHASTITY: All I know is I 'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey .
KAT: Bianca , I need to talk to you I need to tell you
BIANCA: I really do n't think I need any social advice from you right now .
KAT: I want another one
JOEY: My man
PATRICK: It 's about time .
JOEY: A deal 's a deal .
PATRICK: Do what ?
JOEY: Get her to act like a human
PATRICK: Okay ?
KAT: I 'm fine . I 'm
PATRICK: You 're not okay .
KAT: I just need to lie down for awhile
PATRICK: Uh , uh . You lie down and you 'll go to sleep
KAT: I know , just let me sleep
PATRICK: What if you have a concussion ? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable . Not that I could tell the difference
KAT: Okay , I 'll just sleep but stay awake , okay ?
PATRICK: C'mon , let 's walk
CAMERON: It 's off . The whole thing .
PATRICK: What 're you talking about ?
CAMERON: She 's partial to Joey , not me
PATRICK: Cameron do you like the girl ?
CAMERON: Sure
PATRICK: Then , go get he
KAT: This is so patronizing .
PATRICK: Leave it to you to use big words when you 're shitfaced .
KAT: Why 're you doing this ?
PATRICK: I told you
KAT: You do n't care if I die
PATRICK: Sure , I do
KAT: Why ?
PATRICK: Because then I 'd have to start taking out girls who like me .
KAT: Like you could find one
PATRICK: See that ? Who needs affection when I 've got blind hatred ?
KAT: Just let me sit down .
PATRICK: How 's that ?
KAT: Who ?
PATRICK: Dorsey .
KAT: I hate him .
PATRICK: I know . It 'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila . You do n't seem like the type .
KAT: Hey man . . . You don ' t think I can e `` cool '' ? You do n't think I can be `` laid back '' like everyone else ?
PATRICK: I thought you were above all that
KAT: You know what they say
PATRICK: No . What do they say ?
KAT: What ?
PATRICK: I thought you were
KAT: Go away
BIANCA: Dinner taste better on the way out ?
KAT: You 're welcome .
PATRICK: Cute
JOEY: A bunch of us are going to Jaret 's house . Wan na come ?
BIANCA: I have to be home in twenty minutes .
CHASTITY: I do n't have to be home 'til two .
JOEY: Then , c'mon . Maybe next time
CAMERON: Have fun tonight ?
BIANCA: Tons
PATRICK: I 'm driving , so I get to pick the tunes .
KAT: It 's my car .
PATRICK: And I 'm in control of it .
KAT: But it 's Gigglepuss - I know you like them . I saw you there .
PATRICK: Busy
KAT: Were you in jail ?
PATRICK: Maybe .
KAT: No , you were n't
PATRICK: Then why 'd you ask ?
KAT: Why 'd you lie ?
PATRICK: Do what ?
KAT: This .
PATRICK: Start a band ?
KAT: My father would n't approve of that that
PATRICK: You do n't strike me as the type that would ask permission .
KAT: Oh , so now you think you know me ?
PATRICK: I 'm gettin ' there
KAT: The only thing people know about me is that I 'm `` scary '' .
KAT: He just wants me to be someone I 'm not .
PATRICK: Who ?
KAT: BIANCA
PATRICK: No offense , but you 're sister is without . I know everyone likes her and all , but
KAT: You know you 're not as vile as I thought you were .
PATRICK: So , I 'll see you in school
CAMERON: I looked for you back at the party , but you always seemed to be `` occupied '' .
BIANCA: I was ?
CAMERON: You never wanted to go out with 'me , did you ?
BIANCA: Well , no
CAMERON: Then that 's all you had to say .
BIANCA: But
CAMERON: You always been this selfish ?
DEREK: Kat , my lady , you sway to the rhythm of my heart .
CLEM: Yippe kai-aye , bra . Dance for me , cowgirl .
DEREK: Because the deputy meant him no harm , my friend . It was only the sheriff that was the oppressor .
JOEY: Kat , babe , you were on fire .
MRS. BLAISE: Well now , did everyone have a good weekend ?
JOEY: Maybe we should ask Verona
MRS. BLAISE: Okay then . Well . Oh , yes
DEREK: In faith , I do not love thee with mine eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors note/ But 't is my heart that loves what they despise/ Who in despite of view is pleas 'd to dote .
CLEM: Ms. Blaise , can I get the bathroom pass ? Damn if Shakespeare do n't act as a laxative on my person .
MANDELLA: You went to the party ? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity .
KAT: I did n't have a choice .
MANDELLA: You did n't have a choice ? Where 's Kat and what have you done with her ?
KAT: I did Bianca a favor and it backfired .
MANDELLA: You did n't
KAT: I got drunk . I puked . I got rejected . It was big fun .
PATRICK: Hey
MICHAEL: So you got cozy with she who stings ?
PATRICK: No - I 've got a sweet-payin ' job that I 'm about to lose .
CAMERON: What 'd you do to her ?
PATRICK: I don ' t know . I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it .
MICHAEL: I 'm on it
MANDELLA: Hi .
MICHAEL: Cool pictures . You a fan ?
MANDELLA: Yeah . I guess .
MICHAEL: Oh yeah .
MANDELLA: Who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart , courage to make ' B love known ?
MICHAEL: Macbeth , right ?
MANDELLA: Right .
MICHAEL: Kat a fan , too ?
MANDELLA: Yeah
MICHAEL: So , listen I have this friend
CAMERON: She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That 's a direct quote
PATRICK: She just needs time to cool off I 'll give it a day .
CAMERON: She kissed me .
PATRICK: Where ?
JOEY: Do n't talk to me about the sweetest date . That little halo Bianca is gon na e prone and proven on prom night . Six virgins in a row .
PATRICK: I do n't know , Dorsey . ..the limo.-the flowers . Another hundred for the tux
JOEY: Enough with the Barbie n ' Ken shit . I know .
KAT: Can you even imagine ? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ?
MANDELLA: Well , I guess we 're not , since we do n't have dates .
KAT: Listen to you ! You sound like Betty , all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica .
MANDELLA: Okay , okay , we wo n't go . It 's not like I have a dress anyway
KAT: You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective . We 're making a statement .
MANDELLA: Oh , good . Something new and different for us .
JOEY: Hey , sweet cheeks .
BIANCA: Hi , Joey .
JOEY: You 're concentrating awfully hard considering it 's gym class .
BIANCA: You know the deal . I can ' t go if Kat does n't go
JOEY: Your sister is going .
BIANCA: Since when ?
JOEY: I 'm taking care of it .
PATRICK: Excuse me , have you seen The Feminine Mystique ? I lost my copy .
KAT: What are you doing here ?
PATRICK: I heard there was a poetry reading .
KAT: You 're so
PATRICK: Pleasant ?
KAT: Unwelcome .
PATRICK: Unwelcome ? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist .
KAT: Do n't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties .
PATRICK: So what did I have an effect on ?
KAT: Other than my upchuck reflex ? Nothing .
PATRICK: You were right . She 's still pissed .
MICHAEL: Sweet love , renew thy force !
PATRICK: Man do n't say shit like that to me . People can hear you .
CAMERON: You humiliated the woman ! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score .
MICHAEL: Best case scenario , you 're back on the payroll for awhile .
PATRICK: What 's the worst ?
CAMERON: You get the girl .
PATRICK: If I go down . I 'm takin ' her with me
PATRICK: `` I think I love you I ``
MISCREANT: Nice song , Verona .
PATRICK: Flog me .
KAT: Sir , I 'd like to state for the record that Mr. Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary . I neve filed a complaint .
MR. CHAPIN: You did n't have to . He disrupted a classroom .
KAT: But , Mr. Chapin , I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention . There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a egular basis .
MR. CHAPIN: You 're not gon na change my mind , Kat . Rules stick .
KAT: Wait , Mr. Chapin . There 's something I 've always wanted to show you .
MR. CHAPIN: What ?
KAT: These .
MR. CHAPIN: I 'm going to let that slide , Katarina . But if I catch you doing that again , you 'll be in here with the rest of these guys .
KAT: Thank you , Mr. Chapin .
PATRICK: Look up , sunshine
KAT: C'mon . It 's not that bad
PATRICK: Try lookin ' at it from this angle
KAT: Put your right foot there
PATRICK: Forget it . I 'm stayin ' .
KAT: You want me to climb up and show you how to get down ?
PATRICK: Maybe .
KAT: You shit !
PATRICK: I figured it had to be something idiculous to win your respect . And piss you off .
KAT: Good call .
PATRICK: So how 'd you get Chapin to look the other way ?
KAT: I dazzled him with my wit
PATRICK: A soft side ? Who knew ?
KAT: Yeah , well , do n't let it get out
PATRICK: So what 's your excuse ?
KAT: Acting the way we do .
PATRICK: Yes
KAT: I do n't like to do what people expect . Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change .
PATRICK: So if you disappoint them from the start , you 're covered ?
KAT: Something like that
PATRICK: Then you screwed up
KAT: How ?
PATRICK: You never disappointed me .
KAT: For . . . ?
KID: Look , Mom
KAT: State trooper ?
PATRICK: Fallacy .
KAT: The duck ?
PATRICK: Hearsay .
KAT: I know the porn career 's a lie .
PATRICK: Do you ?
KAT: Tell me something true .
PATRICK: I hate peas .
KAT: No something real . Something no one else knows .
PATRICK: You 're sweet . And sexy . And completely hot for me .
KAT: What ?
PATRICK: No one else knows
KAT: You 're amazingly self-assured . Has anyone ever told you that ?
PATRICK: Go to the prom with me
KAT: Is that a request or a command ?
PATRICK: You know what I mean
KAT: No .
PATRICK: No what ?
KAT: No , I wo n't go with you
PATRICK: Why not ?
KAT: Because I do n't want to . It 's a stupid tradition .
PATRICK: People wo n't expect you to go
KAT: Why are you doing this ?
PATRICK: So I have to have a motive to be with you ?
KAT: You tell me .
PATRICK: You need therapy . Has anyone ever told you that ?
KAT: Answer the question , Patrick
PATRICK: Nothing ! There 's nothing in it for me . Just the pleasure of your company .
BIANCA: Quick question are you going to the prom ?
CAMERON: No
BIANCA: do you listen to this crap ?
CAMERON: What crap ?
BIANCA: Me . This endless blonde babble . I 'm like , boring myself .
CAMERON: Thank God ! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure
BIANCA: What good stuff ?
CAMERON: The `` real you '' .
BIANCA: Like my fear of wearing pastels ?
CAMERON: No
BIANCA: Okay you 're gon na need to learn how to lie .
TREVOR: You 're gon na look splendiferous in that , Mandella .
SHARON: Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral ?
WALTER: Pirate no question .
BIANCA: Daddy , I want to discuss the prom with you . It 's tomorrow night
WALTER: The prom ? Kat has a date ?
BIANCA: No , but
WALTER: It 's that hot rod Joey , right ? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for ?
BIANCA: He 's not a `` hot rod '' . Whatever that is .
WALTER: You 're not going unless your siste goes . End of story .
BIANCA: Fine . I see that I 'm a prisoner in my own house . I 'm not a daughter . I 'm a possession !
WALTER: You know what happens at proms ?
SHARON: They 'll dance , they 'll kiss , they 'll come home . Let her go .
WALTER: Kissing ? Is that what you think happens ? Kissing is n't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day .
BIANCA: Come in .
KAT: Listen , I know you hate having to sit home because I 'm not Susie High School .
BIANCA: Like you care .
KAT: I do care . But I 'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons , not someone else ' s .
BIANCA: I wish I had that luxury . I 'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I ca n't go , because you won ' t .
KAT: Joey never told you we went out , did he ?
BIANCA: What ?
KAT: In 9th . For a month
BIANCA: Why ?
KAT: He was , like , a total babe
BIANCA: But you hate Joey
KAT: Now I do . Back then , was a different story .
BIANCA: As in
KAT: He said everyone was doing it . So I did it .
BIANCA: You did what ?
KAT: Just once . Afterwards , I told him I did n't want to anymore . I was n't ready . He got pissed . Then he broke up with me .
BIANCA: But
KAT: After that , I swore I 'd never do anything just because `` everyone else '' was doing it . And I have n't since . Except for Bogey 's party , and my stunning gastro-intestinal display
BIANCA: Why did n't you tell me ?
KAT: I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him .
BIANCA: No . you did n't ! If you really thought I could make my own decisions , you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage .
KAT: That 's not
BIANCA: I 'm not stupid enough to repeat you mistakes .
KAT: I guess I thought I was protecting you .
BIANCA: God , you 're just like him ! Just keep me locked away in the dark , so I ca n't experience anything for myself
KAT: Not all experiences are good , Bianca . You ca n't always trust the people you want to .
BIANCA: I guess I 'll never know , will I ?
KAT: Feel like shopping ?
WALTER: What do you wan na watch ? We 've got crap , crap , crap or crap
SHARON: Dr. Ruth ?
BIANCA: Hi , Mommy .
SHARON: Honey , you look beautiful !
BIANCA: You like ? My date should be here in five .
WALTER: I 'm missing something .
BIANCA: I have a date , Daddy . And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know .
CAMERON: Wow
BIANCA: Let 's go .
SHARON: Have a great time , honey !
WALTER: But who what ?
KAT: Hey , guys . I 'm going to the prom . See you in a few .
WALTER: What just happened ?
SHARON: Your daughters went to the prom .
WALTER: Did I have anything to say about it ?
SHARON: Absolutely not .
WALTER: That ' s what I thought
JOEY: I 'm here to pick up Bianca .
WALTER: late
KAT: How 'd you get a tux at the last minute ?
PATRICK: It 's Scurvy 's . His date got convicted . Where 'd you get the dress ?
KAT: It 's just something I had . You know
PATRICK: Oh huh
KAT: Look , I 'm sorry that I questioned your motives . I was wrong .
PATRICK: No prob .
KAT: are you ready ?
PATRICK: Look , Clem even wore his good boots
MANDELLA: Have you seen him ?
KAT: Who ?
MANDELLA: William - he asked me to meet him here .
KAT: Oh , honey tell me we have n't ' progressed to full-on hallucinations .
MICHAEL: Mi ' lady .
BIANCA: What are you doing here ?
CHASTITY: You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom ?
BIANCA: I did .
CHASTITY: And just so you know , my date is n't planning on spending most of the night in his backseat .
PATRICK: My grandmother 's .
KAT: What ?
PATRICK: That 's where I was last year . She 'd never lived alone my grandfather died I stayed with her . I was n't in jail , I do n't know Marilyn Manson , and I 've never slept with a Spice Girl . I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune . End of story .
KAT: That ' s completely adorable !
PATRICK: It gets worse you still have you freshman yearbook ?
JOEY: What 's Bianca doing here with that cheese dick ? I did n't pay you to let some little punk ass snake me .
MICHAEL: Feces hitting fan . C'mon
CAMERON: Admit it . You lost . Be a man .
DEREK: Very uncool , my brothe
JOEY: I 'm not your brother , white boy .
BIANCA: That 's for making my date bleed
COWBOY: And that 's for the fourth grade , asshole .
PATRICK: Wait I
KAT: You were paid to take me out ! By the one person I truly hate . I knew it was a set-up !
PATRICK: It was n't like that .
KAT: Really ? What was it like ? A down payment now , then a bonus for sleeping with me ?
PATRICK: I did n't care about the money .
KAT: You are so not what I thought you were .
BIANCA: Are you sure you do n't want to come with us ? It 'll be fun .
KAT: I ' m sure .
BIANCA: You looked beautiful last night , you know .
KAT: So did you
CAMERON: She okay ?
BIANCA: I hope so .
WALTER: Was that your sister ?
KAT: Yeah . She left with some bikers Big ones . Full of sperm .
WALTER: Funny .
KAT: No , Daddy .
WALTER: So tell me about this dance . Was it fun ?
KAT: Parts of it .
WALTER: Which parts ?
KAT: The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy .
WALTER: Bianca did what ?
KAT: What 's the matter ? Upset that I rubbed off on her ?
WALTER: No impressed .
KAT: When I go ?
WALTER: Oh , Christ . Do n't tell me you 've changed your mind . I already sent 'em a check .
CAMERON: I 'd like to express my apologies .
KAT: For what ?
CAMERON: I did n't mean for you to get When Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend , I had no idea it would turn out so ugly . I would never have done anything to compromise your - - -
TEACHER: Who can tell me at what point Lucentio admits his deception ?
KAT: Family emergency .
BIANCA: Let go !
KAT: You set me up .
BIANCA: I just wanted
KAT: What ? To completely damage me ? To send me to therapy forever ? What ?
BIANCA: No ! I just wanted
MISS PERKY: Ladies ? Shall we take a trip to my office ?
BIANCA: Yes ! Okay ? Yes I 'm the real bitch . I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I could . Apparently , this makes me a horrible person . I 'm sorry .
MISS PERKY: Do you care to respond ?
KAT: Am I supposed to feel better ? Like , ight now ? Or do I have some time to think about it ?
MISS PERKY: Just smack her now .
BIANCA: We 'll be getting back to you .
MISS PERKY: What , no hug ?
BIANCA: Is that woman a complete fruit-loop o is it just me ?
KAT: It 's just you .
MRS. BLAISE: All right . I 'm assuming everyone found time to compose , their poems . Except fo Mr. Dorsey , who 's still in ICU .
KAT: I'11 go
MRS. BLAISE: Oh , Lord .
KAT: I hate the way you talk to me/ and the way you cut your hair/ I hate the way you drive my car/ I hate it when you stare .
PATRICK: I thought you could use it . When you start your band .
KAT: Is that right ?
PATRICK: Yeah , but then I fucked up . I fell fo her .
KAT: You ca n't just buy me a guitar every time you screw up , you know .
PATRICK: I know
KAT: And do n't just think you can

CAMERON: They do to !
BIANCA: They do not !
CAMERON: Can someone please tell her that sunflower seeds come from sunflowers ?

JACOB: This is n't about the play station . It 's about this thing on my face . Everybody hates it .
RUDY: I do n't .
JACOB: Who cares what you think ? You 're the reason for all of this . Perfect you with your perfect skin . There to show the world what I 'm supposed to look like . You know , sometimes I just wish I was n't your twin .
RUDY: Screw you ! Know what , I take it ack , you ca n't use my play station .
GABE: 30 acres .
JIM: I already told you , Gabe , I 'm not selling that land . Not 30 acres not five .
GABE: I 'm willing to pay top dollar .
JIM: I 'm not gon na let you tear down those woods , so you can stack twenty houses right on top of each other .
GABE: I 'm gon na write down a number .
JIM: No ! My kids hell , your kids play in those woods all the time . You ca n't put a price on that .
GABE: I believe I can .
PATRICK: Good eating , huh son ?
LEONARD: Maybe you should n't have seconds , Dad , you know ?
PATRICK: Who are you , Richard Simmons ? C'mon , enjoy the day .
KENNY: Me and Jeff are gon na pay that tree house of yours a little visit tonight .
RUDY: Why do n't you take your smelly ass ack to the trailer park ?
KENNY: Free country , asshole .
RUDY: You got nothing better to do than pick on us all the time ?
KENNY: I did until yesterday .
RUDY: I thought you liked `` golden showers '' . Oh no , that was you mother .
KENNY: I 'll finish this tonight !
RUDY: Kenny showed up . He said , Jeff and him are gon na tear the treehouse down tonight . We got ta sneak out and stop them .
JACOB: Mom and Dad would kill us .
RUDY: We ca n't let him tear it down .
JACOB: It 's just a treehouse .
RUDY: No , it 's not ! You know what , you suck . I 'm going . Leonard , you in ?
JACOB: You do n't have to go if you do n't want to .
RUDY: Do n't listen to him . He 's a pussy .
LEONARD: I 'll go .
RUDY: Finally , someone with balls .
JACOB: Rudy .
RUDY: Unless you 're coming with me , I do n't want to hear it .
JACOB: What ?
RUDY: Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the time , and you do n't do shit .
JACOB: It 's my problem .
RUDY: No , it 's mine too . Cause we 're others . That 's what brothers do . They fight for each other , kill fo each other , die for each other .
JACOB: I do n't feel that way .
RUDY: Cause you 're a pussy . So stay home , keep your head under the lankets . I 'm gon na fight .
LEONARD: Some provisions .
RUDY: We 're only gon na be here a couple of hours .
LEONARD: When two o'clock rolls around , you 'll be begging for one of these .
RUDY: Moron , the bat is for Jeff and Kenny . You know , to scare them a little .
LEONARD: I 'm wide awake . I could stay up all night .
RUDY: What What is it ? They here ?
LEONARD: No .
RUDY: Where you going ?
LEONARD: They 're not gon na show up , I 'm goin ' home . It 's three o'clock-
KENNY: Now yours . And aim for the window .
JEFF: You hear that ?
RUDY: Put it out ! Put it out !
JEFF: They 're in there ! They 're in there !
KENNY: Wake up ! Wake up , kid !
JIM: Ashley ? What is it ?
ASHLEY: I forgot to deposit your paycheck last week .
JIM: But I already wrote some checks .
ASHLEY: I know . With the cookout and everything , I forgot . I 'll deposit it tomorrow . The holiday should uy us an extra day .
JIM: Write yourself a note so you do n't forget again .
ASHLEY: I just did .
PRIEST: Rest in piece , Rudolph Eugene Carges . May God hold you in the palm of his hand .
GUS: Friend or family ?
MALEE: Huh ?
GUS: The person who died .
MALEE: Friend .
GUS: I 'm sorry . You 'll like Dr. Chung . This is only my second session , but she 's good .
MALEE: I 'm not a patient . I 'm he daughter .
GUS: Oh . I can see the resemblance .
MALEE: Are you trying to make me sick ?
YACCO: Mr. Maitland ?
MALEE: It was a funeral , Mom . How do you think it was ?
YACCO: I 'm sorry I could n't make it . Let Rudy 's parents know I 'm available if they need to talk . I wo n't charge for the sessions .
MALEE: I know it 's okay to cry . I do n't need you to tell me , it 's okay to cry . If I want to cry , I 'll cry .
YACCO: Okay .
MOTHER: Ashley , there 's more than enough food here .
ASHLEY: No , Rudy loved my deviled eggs . It 's right that I make them . Where 's the paprika ?
ASHLEY: It 's okay .
GRACE: This hospital is a nightmare . The elevator is never there when you need it .
PATRICK: Where are the girls ?
GRACE: Haley took Sara up to the maternity ward .
LEONARD: My head hurts .
GRACE: You 're lucky you did n't get killed .
LEONARD: I told you , I 'm sorry .
GRACE: You try being awakened at fou o'clock in the morning by the police saying , they have your son , he 's unconscious and on his way to the hospital . I 've never been so scared in my life . And poor Rudy .
LEONARD: My best friend is dead !
GRACE: Eat this . It 'll make you feel etter .
LEONARD: I 'm not hungry . Besides , I ca n't taste anything anyway .
GRACE: Hospital food is always bland . This has flavor .
LEONARD: No , it 's because of my condition . I ca n't taste or smell anything anymore .
GRACE: What are you saying , condition ? What condition ?
LEONARD: My condition .
DOCTOR: Leonard has a condition . It 's called Anosmia .
GRACE: Oh my God ! Is it serious ?
DOCTOR: No . Anosmia is when a person looses their sense of smell . It 's not uncommon in patients who suffe serious head injuries . Unfortunately , it 's also affecting his ability to taste . Again , not uncommon .
PATRICK: Is it permanent ?
DOCTOR: Depends on the patient .
GRACE: What do we do ? He ca n't eat .
DOCTOR: He can eat . He just ca n't taste what he 's eating .
PATRICK: What she means is , he wo n't eat .
DOCTOR: Leonard 's association with food is no longer about taste . It 's about texture . While we may be partial to sweet or salty foods , Leonard will become partial to crunchy o smooth ones . Once he settles on a texture he likes , his appetite will increase .
GRACE: I ca n't believe this is happening .
DOCTOR: Considering what Leonard could have suffered , he 's lucky . Besides , he is severely overweight . A loss of appetite may be a benefit .
NURSE: How 'd we do ?
LEONARD: This stuff feels like shit in my mouth .
NURSE: It 's macaroni and cheese .
LEONARD: It feels gross . Like there 's a film on my tongue .
NURSE: So , you ca n't taste it , right ? Maybe you 'll like the crunch .
GABE: I 'm leaving , Jim . Again , so sorry .
JIM: Gabe , are you still interested in uying the land ? Because I accept your offer .
GABE: This is hardly the time to talk usiness .
JIM: Buy the woods , Gabe , please . Tea them down and build . Build houses , condos , a 7-11 , I do n't care . I just do n't want to recognize it ever again .
LEONARD: You holding up alright , Jacob ?
JACOB: Jeff and Kenny were the ones that started the fire . It was thei fault . Or maybe mine . I should of een there .
MALEE: You would n't have been able to do anything . And it could have been you who died .
JACOB: I wish it was . You know the last thing Rudy said to me ? He said , I ca n't be a pussy all my life . He was right , I am . And Rudy might be dead because of it .
MALEE: Do n't say that . Why do n't you talk to your parents about this ?
JACOB: They ca n't help me .
MALEE: Give them time . It 'll get better .
JACOB: What if it does n't ? My dad has n't gone back to work yet . What if he loses his job . We could lose ou house . I could be homeless .
MALEE: Then you 'll stay with me .
LEONARD: Or me .
JACOB: We 're best friends . We
MALEE: Oh my God .
JACOB: What ?
MALEE: That guy . I like know him . He 's one of my mother 's patients .
LEONARD: So ?
MALEE: I 've never seen a patient of hers actually out and about . Should we go over and say `` hi '' ?
JACOB: I just want to get out of here .
LEONARD: You coming , Malee ?
GRACE: No , this is all for you . You favorites ; fried chicken , spaghetti , pizza , french fries , and chocolate cheesecake for dessert . I made everything extra spicy , so you can taste it .
LEONARD: Ma , it does n't matter how spicy the food is .
GRACE: So you 're not even gon na try it ?
LEONARD: I 'm sure it 's delicious .
GRACE: Forget it . Do n't eat .
LEONARD: Why not ?
GRACE: It 's unhealthy .
TEACHER: Tommy Wallace .
TOMMY: He 's not in this class anymore .
TEACHER: How do you know ?
JACOB: Cause he 's dead .
TEACHER: I realize being new at this school puts me at a disadvantage , but joking about a fellow classmate 's death is anything but funny , Mr .
JACOB: I 'm his brother . Was . And I 'm not joking . He 's dead .
TEACHER: I 'm so sorry . Wow , this is awkward . Would you like the seat left empty ?
JACOB: Why ?
TEACHER: In memory .
COACH: Alright , ladies , welcome to gym . We will be starting things off this year with the United States Standardized Fitness Test .
LEONARD: That was as far as I could pull myself up .
COACH: Ten seconds . You need forty to pass .
LEONARD: Not bad .
COACH: The goal was 8 .
LEONARD: Football ?
COACH: You do n't like football ?
LEONARD: I love it . It 's just I 'll neve make the weight requirement . Pop Warner league would n't let me play for five years because of it .
COACH: There 's no weight requirement in high school ball , son .
LEONARD: Books ?
COACH: One is on nutrition , the othe exercise . You do what they say , and you can play for me once you get to high school .
LEONARD: Thanks .
COACH: Because I 've never seen a child so out of shape in my life .
MR FARMER: Did anyone practice over the summer ?
MR. FARMER: Great . Well , we still have a fall ecital coming up . If anyone would like to perform a solo , sign up on the sheet outside my office . Class dismissed .
ASHLEY: No , they 're wrong . Call them back .
JIM: Ashley , I talked to the lawyer . He would n't lie .
JACOB: What 's going on ?
ASHLEY: This is all your fault .
JIM: Me ?
ASHLEY: If we had gone to the hearings like I said , this would n't be happening .
JIM: We agreed it would be too painful .
ASHLEY: You agreed .
JACOB: Mom , what happened ?
ASHLEY: Tell him . Tell your son .
JIM: The boys who killed Rudy cut a deal . They got a year in juvinile hall and five years probation .
ASHLEY: A year . That 's what your brother 's life is worth . A damn year !
JIM: Ashley , calm down !
ASHLEY: How can you be so unaffected by this ! How ? Our son was murdered !
JIM: It was an accident , and the boys are juveniles .
ASHLEY: So that makes it okay ?
GUS: Dr. Chung 's daughter .
MALEE: You remembered . We were neve introduced . My name is Malee .
GUS: Gus .
MALEE: I was in the mood for a picnic . I thought this would be a nice place to have one .
GUS: I do n't go to lunch for another ten minutes .
MALEE: I 'll wait . Meet me by the cement mixer when you 're ready .
GUS: The last time I saw you , you had just come from a funeral . How are you doing ?
MALEE: Okay . Death is like so weird . I mean , it 's sad , but I also feel like I 've been given this sign . A sign which is telling me , life is short , so you got ta do what makes you happy . You got ta take chances . You got ta get crazy .
GUS: What are you doing to `` get crazy '' ?
MALEE: I play the flute .
GUS: Yeah , that 's totally nuts .
MALEE: No , not that . See , every year my school has this recital . I 've always been too scared to play a solo in front of people , but this year I 've decided to do it .
GUS: Good for you . When is it ?
MALEE: Why do you care ?
GUS: Cause I 'm gon na go .
MALEE: What ? You ca n't go ! Nobody goes to these things . I do n't even think my mom is going .
GUS: You got ta have somebody rooting fo ya . Besides , I like music , and I owe you for bringing me lunch .
MALEE: Okay . Tuesday at 8 30 in the junior high school auditorium .
GUS: I 'll be there .
MALEE: Do n't say it if you do n't mean it .
GUS: I 'll be there . Front row .
LEONARD: I ca n't believe how much you suck at this game .
JACOB: No .
LEONARD: You wan na shoot some hoops ?
JACOB: No . The sentencing thing totally upset my mom . She was up half the night , crying .
LEONARD: I ca n't believe it either . A yea ai n't shit ! Rudy is dead forever .
JACOB: I want them dead . I want to kill them . I could handle a year in Juvy hall .
MALEE: Whoa , what those guys did was an accident . If you were to kill them , it 's premedicated . You 'd get 20 years to life at least .
JACOB: So I 'm just supposed to sit here and take it ? Be like you guys .
LEONARD: What is that supposed to mean ?
JACOB: You seem to have gone on with life pretty easily . Do n't you miss him ? Do n't you care ?
MALEE: It 's not that we do n't care . It 's just
JACOB: Life goes on .
MALEE: It does . You have to deal with it . If you do n't , it could like eat you alive forever . 90 percent of people 's problems is due to thei inability to get over the past .
LEONARD: How do you know ?
MALEE: My mom tells that to all he patients . I 've eavesdropped on some of her therapy sessions .
LEONARD: That 's awesome . Can I listen in sometime ?
MALEE: No . Anyway , she says , if a person wants closure , they got ta deal with their problems head on . Go see these guys and let them know how you feel .
JACOB: I do n't think my parents would be up for that .
MALEE: Go alone . Juvy hall is only like forty minutes from here . Take the us .
JACOB: Bye , Dad .
KENNY: He 's sick . I think he
JACOB: I hate you . You know that ? You astard .
KENNY: Rudy knew we were going to be there . He never should have come . You want the truth , all this happened cause of you .
JACOB: Me ?
KENNY: Yeah , you deformed retard ! The only reason we started picking on you guys in the first place was ecause of that thing on your face .
JACOB: Every night , I lie in bed and plan your murder .
KENNY: I 'm shaking .
JACOB: First I 'm going to take a kitchen knife and chop off your fingers then your nose then your tongue . Then I 'm gon na poke out your eyes with the end of a broomstick . Well , not really poke them out , but I 'm gon na push them back into you ain . Then I 'm gon na take scissors and cut off your ears . When they find you , it 's gon na be like putting a jigsaw puzzle back together .
KENNY: If you kill me , you come here .
JACOB: So ? What do I have to look forward to ? You 've already destroyed my life .
KENNY: What happened was an accident .
JACOB: There are no accidents . You 're gon na pay for what you did . And it 's gon na hurt like hell .
GRACE: What the hell is this ?
LEONARD: I 'm reading the list of ingredients in our foods .
GRACE: Why ?
LEONARD: Research . Do you know the damage these chemicals can do to the human ody ?
GRACE: Leonard , put everything back .
LEONARD: This is serious . You ca n't keep uying this crap . Do n't you care that you 're ingesting garbage ?
GRACE: Just put everything back and go to sleep .
YACCO: Post traumatic stress is very common in your line of work . Many fire fighters go through this .
GUS: Yeah . But why now ? I have n't fought fires in ten years .
YACCO: Sometimes we experience something so horrific , our memory blocks it out . That way we wo n't have to elive the pain . It 's called epression . Our bodies are not so forgiving , however . Inside , we feel the effects of trauma even when we do n't know why .
GUS: What does that mean ?
YACCO: Something stirred your unconscious . If we find out what that was , we can begin the healing process .
GUS: A friend was making good money with construction . He got an offer to uild that extension off Lindsay Acres . He suggested I come into town and work for a while .
YACCO: What ?
GUS: Light my fire . The Doors song . `` Da da something wallow in the mire Da , da we could n't get much higher . Come on baby light my fire .
YACCO: Interesting .
JACOB: Dad ?
JIM: Jacob .
JACOB: You okay ?
JIM: Fantastic .
JACOB: Me ?
JIM: Jacob . I love you .
JACOB: Yeah ?
JIM: Will you join me ? Join me in this celebration of life . A symbolic gesture of cleaning out the old and inging in the new .
JACOB: Do I have to ?
JIM: No , you do n't have to .
JACOB: Good night , Dad .
MR. FARMER: I 'm sure Bette Midler would be most impressed with that rendition .
MALEE: Thank you , Mr. Farmer .
MALEE: Where 's Jacob ?
LEONARD: Could n't make it . He
MALEE: Oh my God ! He 's coming over .
LEONARD: Who ?
MALEE: Shut up ! Leave now .
GUS: You were awesome .
MALEE: Really ? Be honest . I 'd rather you tell me I sucked then lie .
GUS: You were great .
MALEE: Excuse me for a second .
LEONARD: Ow , ow , ow alright . I 'm going .
MALEE: So you really enjoyed it ?
GUS: Yeah . Good song . What made you pick it ?
MALEE: Oh , uh my mother was humming it all last week . Big Doors fan .
GUS: Really ? Is she here ?
MALEE: No .
GUS: She missed out .
MALEE: You 're so sweet .
GUS: Yeah well , I have to go , but thanks again . I had a great time .
GRACE: That boy is going to bring the entire house down .
PATRICK: Let him be . He 's looking good . I 'm proud of him .
GRACE: Girls , have you decided what you 're going to go as for Halloween ?
SARA: Either a witch or a princess .
GRACE: That 's nice . Haley ?
HALEY: I 'm going to go as a marble .
GRACE: What do you mean , a marble ?
HALEY: You know , like a bag of marbles , ut just one marble .
JEFF: I 'm really sorry , man . I
JACOB: You just think about what I said . Get out of my sight . And send Kenny in on your way out .
KENNY: What did you say to him ?
JACOB: I thought you 'd both like to know that Halloween was Rudy 's favorite holiday .
KENNY: Stop it .
JACOB: After we 'd go trick or treating , we 'd sit in our room and swap the candy we hated . Rudy loved Snickers , I Almond Joys .
KENNY: Almond Joy sucks .
JACOB: What sucks is that I 'll never get to sit in my room and swap candy with my brother ever again . Thanks to you .
KENNY: Why are you doing this ?
JACOB: To remind you .
KENNY: How could we forget ? You been coming here for months to `` remind us '' .
JACOB: No one is forcing you to talk to me .
KENNY: Anything to get out of my cell .
JACOB: Is your cell small ?
KENNY: Yes .
JACOB: So is a coffin .
KENNY: You 're not the only one who wishes he was still alive . I 'd do anything to bring him back , but I ca n't . It 's not easy being in here . Hell , you saw Jeff .
JACOB: What happened to him ?
KENNY: He pissed off the wrong guy off . Jeff is totally fucked right now .
JACOB: Good .
KENNY: Do n't come back here ever again .
JACOB: Free country . I 'll come if I want .
KENNY: Do n't expect me to show up .
GRACE: Be careful now . Have a good night .
HALEY: I hate him ! I hate him !
GRACE: Who ? What happened ?
HALEY: Leonard ! He threw away all ou Halloween candy .
SARA: He grabbed our bags and just threw them down a gutter .
PATRICK: What the hell is going on ? Why did you throw away their candy ?
LEONARD: Because their sugar intake is completely unhealthy . Besides , Halloween is supposed to be a celebration of evil . How did candy get wrapped into it ?
GRACE: I am going to ask you this once , and I want a straight answer . Are you in a cult ?
PATRICK: Grace !
GRACE: This is what happens when kids join cults . The first thing they change is their diets .
LEONARD: I 'm not in a cult . This is all information you can find in books .
GRACE: The issue here is that you have stolen one of the most exciting nights of the year from you sisters .
PATRICK: If anybody had done this to you when you were a child , we neve would have heard the end of it .
LEONARD: I wish somebody had done it to me . I wish either one of you had given a shit about my weight .
PATRICK: I do not care for your language .
LEONARD: I 'm only trying to help you guys .
PATRICK: What 's your point ?
LEONARD: Dad , you and mom are going to die young if you keep eating as poorly as you do .
PATRICK: What is this obsession you have with weight ?
LEONARD: The coach for Jefferson High is also my gym teacher . He told me that if I got into shape , I could start as center for the Freshman team when I get to high school .
PATRICK: Center is a great position . Toughest guy on the field . A good center can make or break a team .
LEONARD: I know . That 's why I 'm trying so hard to get into shape . You guys should to . At the rate you 're going , you wo n't make it to you 60 's .
PATRICK: Look , Leonard . Your mom , to her , a tasty meal is just a way of showing she cares .
LEONARD: She does n't ! Tonight she served spaghetti and meatballs from a can . The amount of sodium alone can wreck havoc on a person 's blood pressure . Not to mention
PATRICK: Leonard , people just do n't drop dead from eating meatballs .
GUS: I ca n't take your Halloween candy .
MALEE: You 'll be doing me a favor . Chocolate gives you zits . Besides , if I want to keep this firm ass as an adult , I got ta develop good eating habits now .
GUS: Maybe just a snickers .
MALEE: So work is good ?
GUS: To be honest , I ca n't wait till this job is finished . This place is creepy . You know , a boy died here like right before we started working .
MALEE: Rudy . His name was Rudy .
GUS: You knew him ?
MALEE: He was one of my best friends . Remember that funeral I went to ?
GUS: That was him ?
MALEE: I thought you knew . Two boys threw a flaming cocktail at him . Can you imagine killing someone like that ? How evil can you get ?
ASHLEY: Jeff Laskey is dead .
JIM: What ?
ASHLEY: He committed suicide in his jail cell last night . Sally Yngve called just now to tell me .
JACOB: Why are you smiling ? A boy died .
ASHLEY: No , a monster that murdered my son died . Justice is served ; end of story .
KENNY: He used his bed sheet , waited until lights out and then jumped .
JACOB: That 's terrible .
KENNY: His cell mate let him hang there the entire night .
JACOB: I 'm sorry , Kenny .
KENNY: Like you even give a shit . I bet when you heard , you started dancing .
JACOB: No .
KENNY: I knew he would n't make it . It 's my fault too . Jeff was n't a saint when I met him , but he sure as hell was n't headed here . That fucking asshole !
JACOB: An IPOD ! Sweet !
ASHLEY: You like it ?
JACOB: I love it . You guys went crazy this year .
JIM: I 'm going to shower .
ASHLEY: Jim , Jacob still has one more present .
JIM: I thought we were going to wait .
JACOB: No , do it now ! Now !
ASHLEY: After serious debate , your fathe and I have decided to adopt A
JACOB: What ?
JIM: We 're gon na adopt a baby . Hopefully a boy .
LEONARD: May I be excused ?
GRACE: No !
MALEE: Why do I have to do this ? It 's Christmas break .
YACCO: You 'll be one step ahead in January .
MALEE: Just because you 're an atheist , I do n't get to celebrate the holidays .
YACCO: Malee .
MALEE: I 'm going for a bike ride .
YACCO: There 's a foot of snow outside .
MALEE: The streets are ploughed . Besides , I like looking at all the lights .
YACCO: Be home in an hour . Be careful .
MALEE: Freeze ! That 's right .
LEONARD: Do n't worry , white male infants are the hardest to come by . 60 minutes did a whole story on it .
MALEE: Since when do you watch 60 minutes ?
LEONARD: Since I was in the hospital . They said , any adoption agency worth its salt has at least a three yea waiting list . By the time you parents get a kid , you 'll be in college . You think they 'll want to start over again with that baby shit ?
JACOB: No , but it 's like they 're trying to eplace Rudy .
LEONARD: It does n't matter cause it 's not gon na happen .
MALEE: I 'm thirsty . Can you get us some drinks ?
LEONARD: Why me ?
MALEE: Because it 's the gentlemanly thing to do .
JACOB: I 'll get the drinks .
MALEE: I 'll go with you .
LEONARD: Why are you all of a sudden going to get the drinks ?
MALEE: Because you 've upset me , and I do n't want to see you right now .
LEONARD: Fine , I 'll get the drinks .
MALEE: I need a favor . It 's big . I need you to hide something for me .
JACOB: Hide what ?
MALEE: Promise , you wo n't freak .
JACOB: I wo n't .
MALEE: You said , you would n't freak !
JACOB: That 's a gun .
MALEE: I know .
JACOB: Where 'd you get it ?
MALEE: I ca n't tell you . I just need you to hide it for a while . When all is cool , I 'll come for it .
JACOB: Why ca n't you keep it ?
MALEE: My mother is a total snoop . She goes through my stuff like all the time . Please , Jacob . Somebody 's life might depend on it .
JACOB: Is it loaded ?
MALEE: No , but I do have some bullets .
JACOB: Nobody has the combination , but me . Besides , I could be building a bom in here , and they would n't even know .
KENNY: That last batch was awesome .
JACOB: I better get going , I do n't want to miss my bus .
KENNY: Before you go , I got some news . Apparently , the parole board feels I 've been a model prisoner , so they 're giving me early release .
JACOB: What ? How can they do that ?
KENNY: I do n't know . They just did . You 're pissed , are n't you ? I knew you would be . It was an accident , Jacob .
JACOB: So you 're getting out . Gon na head ack to school , or
KENNY: Fuck school . I 'm going to live with my Dad in New Mexico . He 's working on a ranch out there .
JACOB: You ca n't leave the state . That violates your probation . You 'll have to
KENNY: My dad wo n't tell anyone . No one will even care I 'm out there .
JACOB: Your mom will .
KENNY: Jacob , in the entire time I 've been locked up , you were the only one who came to see me . Trust me , she wo n't care .
MALEE: 200 dollars ! Dad sent me 200 dollars !
YACCO: No ! Your father went out . He 's not home right now .
MALEE: You 're acting weird . What 's going on ?
YACCO: Nothing .
MALEE: Well , do you want to come with me to the mall and spend it ?
YACCO: I 'd prefer it if you 'd put that money in the bank . Fine , spend it . You 'll have to do it alone though . I have a patient this afternoon . Have a good day .
PATRICK: Here 's the deal . You know how my company flies me to Florida every April ?
LEONARD: You and I have been going since I was eight . It 's the guy 's week off .
PATRICK: This year , I 'm taking the girls . Just the girls . You 're staying home .
LEONARD: Why ca n't we all go ?
GRACE: I 'm not staying here all alone . Besides , you said it yourself , you 've been going for years . Give your sisters a chance .
LEONARD: Whatever . I need money .
PATRICK: What for ?
LEONARD: Clothes . Nothing I have fits anymore .
GRACE: Your father and I are n't rich . You ca n't get a new wardrobe anytime you want .
LEONARD: What am I supposed to do , go to school naked ?
GRACE: Wear a belt .
PATRICK: I 'll give him some cash , he can get some clothes .
GRACE: No . He 's gon na gain all his weight ack in a few months .
PATRICK: Grace .
GRACE: What ? It 's true .
LEONARD: When I was fat . Now I do n't have to wear a T-shirt when I go swimming . Who knows , maybe I could even get lucky .
JACOB: You 're still ugly , though .
LEONARD: I do n't understand what my mother 's problem is . It 's like the thinne I get , the more she hates me .
JACOB: She 's probably jealous . Maybe you should put her on that diet .
LEONARD: Anytime I mention it , my mothe goes crazy .
JACOB: If you really want her to drop a few tons , put her in jail . Kenny 's lost about 30 pounds since he 's een incarcerated , and he was already thin .
LEONARD: Really ?
JACOB: Yeah . Jail is the perfect weight loss program . You take a fat tub , throw them in a room and force them to eat right and exercise . Do n't let them out till they do .
YACCO: Malee , dinner !
MALEE: I got a new look . You know , fo Spring . What do you think ?
YACCO: You look
MALEE: Beautiful ?
YACCO: Different . What happened to you glasses ?
MALEE: Contacts . It took me like forty five minutes to get them in , but eauty is pain .
YACCO: Honey , in the future , I 'd like to know if you 're going to radically change your appearance . Clean you stuff up and come down for dinner .
GUS: Malee ? My God , you look
MALEE: Different ?
GUS: Beautiful . You look beautiful .
MALEE: I felt like I needed a change , you know ?
GUS: I bet you 're driving the boys at school wild .
MALEE: Boys my age are so immature . I 'm more attracted to older gentlemen .
GUS: You do n't want somebody that much older than you . An age difference can cause problems .
MALEE: What kind of problems ?
GUS: A lot of times when a couple has an age difference , they wind up splitting up because they want different things .
MALEE: You mean sex .
GUS: No .
MALEE: Are you impatient ?
GUS: No , but when I was a kid .
MALEE: Why do n't you have a girlfriend ?
GUS: I did , but it did n't work out .
MALEE: How old was she ?
GUS: About my age .
MALEE: See that , age was n't an issue , yet you still wanted different things . I do n't think it 's about age .
LEONARD: Have a good flight !
ASHLEY: We 're home .
JACOB: Hi .
ASHLEY: Could you come downstairs for a minute . We have a surprise fo you .
JIM: This is Keith Gardner . You 're new other . Keith our son , Jacob .
KEITH: It 's nice to meet you .
JACOB: You get top bunk .
KEITH: I 'm kind of afraid of heights .
JACOB: Sucks to be you .
KEITH: I never thought my future brothe would have a KOOL AID stain , smeared across his face .
JACOB: Fuck you , it 's a birthmark !
KEITH: We 're getting off on the wrong foot .
JACOB: When my parents said they were taking in an orphan , I pictured a aby . So what happened , you parents die or something ?
KEITH: I was given up at birth .
JACOB: You gon na try and find your mothe when you 're 18 ?
KEITH: As far as I 'm concerned , the fact she had me was enough . I do n't need to show up one day and disrupt her life .
JACOB: Oh , but it 's okay to just show up one day and disrupt mine ?
KENNY: You 're blaming me for this ?
JACOB: No . But can you believe it ?
KENNY: Maybe this is the only way they can get over Rudy 's death .
JACOB: He 's a person not a fucking vase .
KENNY: I know .
JACOB: I got ta get out of there . I ca n't live in that house for one more day . I want to go with you to New Mexico .
KENNY: No way . You 've never even been out on the road .
JACOB: So .
KENNY: It 's not easy . After first night falls , you 'll be pissing yourself .
JACOB: No , I wo n't .
KENNY: You do n't need me to run away from home .
JACOB: That 's not what this is about .
KENNY: Yes , it is . And you want to come with ME of all people . Are you forgetting , I was the one who killed Rudy !
JACOB: That was an accident .
KENNY: If this is what you want . Alright .
MALEE: Is that Dad ? Can I talk to him ?
YACCO: Take some responsibility fo yourself and grow Hello ?
MALEE: Well , what do you expect ? All you ever do is yell at him .
YACCO: Malee , you do n't understand .
MALEE: He 's my Dad ! I 'm sorry if it others you , but I love him . You keep this up then one day , when I 'm old enough , I 'll leave here and go and stay with him .
GRACE: Leonard ?
GRACE: If I go downstairs , I wo n't be able to make it back up . Let me call 9-1-1 first , okay ?
LEONARD: I hope someone is hungry .
GRACE: Get me out of here now !
LEONARD: No joke , Ma . For the next two weeks while Dad and the girls are away , you will be kept down here . I 'll provide you with nutritious meals and plenty of water . You , mother , will learn what it means to e healthy .
GRACE: That 's what this is about , food ?
LEONARD: I 'm trying to save your life , mom . Trying to give you a life . Cause I love you .
GRACE: My life is fine . I do n't need you to `` save me '' .
LEONARD: You do n't even realize how sick you are . It 's a problem when an otherwise healthy woman ca n't drag her ass up a flight of stairs ecause she 's so obese . You 're staying down here .
GUS: Hello ?
MALEE: I made dinner , my love . And I have a surprise .
GUS: You 've been in my apartment before , have n't you ?
MALEE: Do n't you like my body ?
GUS: Malee , stop .
MALEE: It 's okay because I love you .
GUS: To go call your mother .
MALEE: But we 're soulmates .
YACCO: I do n't know what to say to you .
KEITH: Wan na play some catch ?
JACOB: Where the hell did you get this ?
KEITH: The closet . Ow , what 's wrong ?
JACOB: Did I say you could play with the glove ? Did I ?
KEITH: No , I just
JACOB: Everything , and I mean , EVERYTHING in this room is mine . You are not allowed to touch a thing , especially the glove .
KEITH: Okay , okay .
JACOB: If you tell my parents what I said , I 'll kill you . I 'll shoot you in the fucking face , I swear it !
JACOB: What 's wrong now ?
ASHLEY: I was looking at a picture of you and Rudy when you were born . God , I miss him .
JACOB: But you have Keith now
ASHLEY: What the hell does that mean ?
JACOB: You have Keith . Two boys again . Everything is fine .
ASHLEY: We did n't adopt Keith to replace Rudy .
JACOB: Did n't you ?
ASHLEY: For your information , your fathe and I discussed adopting for years .
JACOB: Right . Maybe if it was me who died , you would n't need another kid to get over it .
ASHLEY: How can you say that ? I neve wanted either of my children to die .
JACOB: But one of us did . If you had to choose which one , I bet you wish it was me .
ASHLEY: I know you think we favored Rudy
JACOB: You did ! Admit it .
ASHLEY: I admit he was easier to raise , but we did n't love him more . Jacob , listen to me . You came with a different set of challenges .
JACOB: My birthmark .
ASHLEY: It 's not easy being different
JACOB: I 'm not different ! ! You always made me feel like something was wrong . There 's nothing wrong with me .
ASHLEY: I know
JACOB: No , you do n't ! It 's like you do n't know how to deal with me . You never did .
ASHLEY: I 'm sorry if that is how you feel . You do the best you can as a parent . You do n't always know what 's right . But you 're my son . I 'd do anything for you . I 'd fight for you , I 'd kill for you , I 'd die for you .
JACOB: Rudy used to say that exact same thing .
ASHLEY: It 's true . And as unchristian as it sounds , I still want the boy that killed Rudy dead . Someday , when you grow up , you 'll understand what I mean . Someday .
GRACE: When Pat calls , and I do n't answer , he 'll know something is wrong . He 'll know . I 'll be fine .
YACCO: Before we begin , I want to apologize . I should have known what was going on with Malee .
GUS: It 's my fault . I knew she had a crush on me . I guess , I felt bad for her . She 's a very unhappy girl .
YACCO: This is your therapy . Not mine . Why was it therapeutic ?
GUS: I slept last night . I ca n't emember the last time I slept so deep or so sound . I do n't remembe dreaming or anything .
YACCO: Why do you think that is ?
GUS: One of the last fires I ever fought was a brownstone , beautiful . The place was burned from roof to asement . Whole family was wiped out . When I was upstairs , inspecting , I found a girl . She could n't have been more than 12 .
YACCO: What did you do ?
GUS: Exactly what she wanted . I placed my hand over her mouth and what was left of her nose , and I I killed her . I told myself it was the ight thing to do , but I 've neve een sure .
YACCO: What does this have to do with Malee ?
GUS: When I saw her last night , she had the same look on her face as that girl . She just wanted me to take away her pain .
YACCO: Would you mind if we cut out early today ? No charge .
GUS: I understand .
MALEE: Why does he hate me ?
GRACE: Leonard !
NURSE: It 's alive !
LEONARD: What happened ?
NURSE: Gas leak .
LEONARD: My mom , she 's
NURSE: She 's fine . They 've taken her into surgery . She blew out her knees somehow . We 're trying to get you father on the phone right now .
NURSE: Shh . You need your rest . Everything is fine now .
KENNY: We got sleeping bags , a tent , canteens and a lantern .
JACOB: Cool .
KENNY: You 're acting weird . You gon na chicken out ?
JACOB: No .
KENNY: You better not . I already packed twice the amount of shit . I ca n't carry it all alone .
JACOB: I 'll be there .
KENNY: Good . I 'm telling you , man . It 's gon na be great .
JACOB: I guess .
KENNY: Come on . You ca n't be a pussy all your life .
JACOB: I know .
KENNY: I 'll see you tonight . Do n't be late .
GRACE: Leonard !
LEONARD: I 'm sorry , mom . I did n't mean to leave the gas on . It was an accident . And everything that happened , I I just thought that maybe , I could help you .
GRACE: Leonard , my mother died at 52 . We had to cremate her body because they did n't make a coffin big enough for her to fit in . Even if they had , no one could have carried it . I loved her so much . I do n't want that to happen to me .
LEONARD: It does n't have to .
GRACE: Even if I can manage the food Can you honestly see me , running a marathon ?
LEONARD: You do n't have to run a marathon . You just have to run to the end of the block . It 's not so hard as you think it is .
GRACE: I 'll try .
LEONARD: Did you tell him what happened ?
GRACE: I told him there was a gas leak .
LEONARD: I meant
GRACE: I know what you meant . I did n't tell him . I do n't think I will .
KENNY: You 're late .
JACOB: I 'm here .
KENNY: Put this on .
JACOB: If people see me riding around in the middle of the night , we 're screwed . You did n't bring a disguise ?
KENNY: Who gives a shit what I 'm up to .
JACOB: Yeah , but if we cut through the construction site , we 'll hit the ailroad tracks . It 's faster and no one will bother us .
KENNY: Good point .
JACOB: I ca n't do this .
KENNY: What ? !
JACOB: I ca n't let you leave , Kenny . You have to pay for what you did .
KENNY: Whoa , whoa hold on . Alright , I I wo n't go . I 'll stay here . I 'll do my probation .
JACOB: You killed him . I got ta do this for my family . It 's the only way .
KENNY: Jacob , I told ya , it it was an accident . I swear . Please , do n't . This is n't you .
JACOB: I know . But I ca n't be a pussy all my life .
KEITH: I thought I was n't supposed to touch this .
JACOB: You 're awake .
KEITH: Yeah .
JACOB: It 's yours . Just do n't leave it outside . If it gets wet , the leather will crack .
KEITH: I 'll take good care of it . I know this was Rudy 's .
JACOB: Just a b-b gun . I returned it to a friend of mine . I 'm sorry for being such an asshole to ya .
KEITH: Does this mean we 're brothers now ?
JACOB: Yeah . We 're brothers .
GUS: Malee ?
MALEE: Do n't be mad . I was just worried about you . Now I 'm out of you life forever . Goodbye . Thanks fo not pressing any charges .
JACOB: Huh ? Oh , yeah .
MALEE: You know , your birthday 's coming up . Any hints as to what you might like ?
JACOB: Whatever you get me will be fine .
MALEE: Right .
JACOB: Never better .

JOSE: `` Volunteers '' again .
SCARFACE: `` Volunteer duty '' .
COLE: I did n't volunteer .
SCARFACE: You causing trouble again ?
COLE: No trouble .
TINY: James Cole . Cleared from quarantine .
MICROBIOLOGIST: Thank you . You two wait outside .
SCARFACE: He 's got a history , Doctor . Violence . COLE 'S eyes return to the walls . Headlines `` CLOCK TICKING ! NO CURE YET ! ''
ENGINEER: I do n't think he 's going to hurt us . You 're not going to hurt us , are you Mr. Cole ? COLE 'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER .
COLE: No , sir .
MICROBIOLOGIST: Why do n't you sit down , Mr. Cole .
ASTROPHYSICIST: We want you to tell us about last night .
COLE: I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told .
MICROBIOLOGIST: We 'll get to the spider later , Mr. Cole . Right now , we want to know everything that you saw .
ASTPOPHYSICIST: Where you collected sample # 4 , what street was that ?
COLE: Uh
BOTANIST: It 's important to observe everything .
COLE: I think it wasI 'm sure it was 2nd Street .
MR. PONYTAIL: WATCH IT !
TERRIFIED TRAVELER: Just exactly why did you volunteer ?
ASTROPHYSICIST: Wake up , Cole .
COLE: Uh , I did n't hear the
MICROBIOLOGIST: I asked you , why did you volunteer ?
COLE: Well , the guard woke me up . He told me I volunteered .
ENGINEER: We appreciate you volunteering . You 're a very good observer , Cole .
COLE: Uh , thank you .
ENGINEER: You 'll get a reduction in sentence . COLE keeps his face impassive .
ASTROPHYSICIST: To be determined by the proper authorities .
ENGINEER: You do n't want to jeopardize that reduction , do you , Cole ? Have it taken away ?
COLE: No , sir !
ASTROPHYSICIST: We have a very advanced program , something very different , requires very skilled people .
MICROBIOLOGIST: An opportunity to reduce your sentence considerably
ZOOLOGIST: And possibly play an important role in eturning the human race to the surface of the earth .
ENGINEER: We want tough minded people . Strong mentally . We 've had somemisfortunes with `` unstable '' types .
ASTROPHYSICIST: For a man in your positionan opportunity .
BOTANIST: Not to volunteer could be a real mistake .
MICROBIOLOGIST: Definitely a mistake !
POET: Still among the myriad microwaves , the infra-red messages , the gigabytes of ones and zeroes , we find words , infinitesimally small , byte-sized now , tinier even than science lurking in some vague electricity where , if we listen we can hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us , `` We are no other than a moving row Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold In Midnight by the Master of the show . ''
FRANKI: so they get there and they ask the guy eal nice for some kind of i.d. , and he gets agitated , starts screaming about viruses . Totally irrational , totally disoriented , does n't know where he is , what day it is , alla that stuff . All they got was his name . They figure he 's stoned out of his mind , it 's some kinda psychotic episode , so they 're gon na bring him
RAILLY: He 's been tested for drugs ?
FRANKI: Negative for drugs . But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs . No drugs . You believe that ?
RAILLY: You have him in restraints .
FRANKI: Were you listening ? We got two officers in the hospital . Yeah , he 's in restraints , plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse . Look at him ! Still on his feet .
RAILLY: That would explain the bruises , I guess . The struggle .
FRANKI: You want to go in ? Examine him ?
RAILLY: Yes , please . You said he gave a name
FRANKI: James Cole . That 's everything we got . None of the James Coles on the computer match him . No license , no prints , no warrants . Nothing . You want me to go in with you ?
RAILLY: No , thank you .
FRANKI: I 'll be right herejust in case .
RAILLY: Mr. Cole ? My name is Doctor Railly . I 'm a psychiatrist . I work for the County I do n't work for the police . My only concern is your well being do you understand that ?
COLE: I need to go now .
RAILLY: I 'm going to be completely honest . I 'm not going to lie to you . I ca n't make the police let you gobut I do want to help you . And I want you to trust me . Can you do that , James ? May I call you `` James '' ?
COLE: `` James '' ! Nobody ever calls me that .
RAILLY: Have you been a patient at County ? Have I seen you someplace ?
COLE: No , not possible . Listen , I have to get out of here . I 'm supposed to be getting information .
RAILLY: What kind of information ?
COLE: It wo n't help you . You ca n't do anything about it . You ca n't change anything .
RAILLY: Change what ?
COLE: I need to go .
RAILLY: Do you know why you 're here , James .
COLE: Because I 'm a good observer . Because I have a tough mind .
RAILLY: I see . You do n't remember assaulting a police officerseveral officers ?
COLE: They wanted identification . I do n't have any identification . I was n't trying to hurt them .
RAILLY: You do n't have a driver 's license , James ? Or a Social Security card ?
COLE: No .
RAILLY: Why not ? Most people have some ID .
COLE: You would n't understand .
RAILLY: You 've been in an institution , have n't you , James ? A hospital ?
COLE: I have to go .
RAILLY: A jail ? Prison ?
COLE: Underground .
RAILLY: Hiding ?
COLE: I love this air . This is wonderful air .
RAILLY: What 's wonderful about the air , James ?
COLE: It 's so clean . No germs .
RAILLY: You 're afraid of germs ?
COLE: I have to go .
RAILLY: Why do you think there are n't any germs in the air , James ?
COLE: This is April , right ?
RAILLY: July .
COLE: July ? !
RAILLY: Do you know what year it is ?
COLE: What year is it ?
RAILLY: What year do you think it is ?
COLE: 1995 ?
RAILLY: You think it 's July of 1995 ? That 's the future , James . Do you think you 're living in the future ?
COLE: No , 1995 is the past .
RAILLY: 1995 is the future , James . This is 1989 . COLE looks stunned .
COLE: Where are you taking me ?
POLICEMAN #1: South of France , buddy . Fancy hotel . You 're gon na love it .
COLE: South of France ? ! I do n't want to go to the South of France . I want to make a telephone call .
POLICEMAN #2: Zip it , scumbag you fooled the shrink with your act , but you do n't fool us .
BILLINGS: Lem me see your head , Jimbo , see if you got any creepy crawlies .
COLE: I need to make a telephone call .
BILLINGS: Got ta work that out with a doctor , Jimbo . Ca n't make no calls 'til the doctor says .
COLE: It 's very important .
BILLINGS: What chew got ta do , Jimbo , is take it easy , relax into things . We all gon na get along fine if you just relax .
JEFFREY: How much you gon na pay me ? Huh ? I 'd e doing your job .
BILLINGS: Five thousand dollars , my man . That enough ? I 'll wire it to your account as usual , okay ?
JEFFREY: Okay , Billings . Five thousand . That 's enough . Five thousand dollars . I 'll give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour .
COLE: I need to make a telephone call .
JEFFREY: A telephone call ? That 's communication with the outside world ! Doctor 's discretion . Hey , if alla these nuts could just make phone calls , it could spread . Insanity oozing through telephone cables , oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people , infecting them ! Whackos everywhere ! A plague of madness . In fact , very few of us here are actually mentally ill . I 'm not saying you 're not mentally ill , for all I know you 're crazy as a loon . But that 's not why you 're here . Why you 're here is because of the system , because of the economy . There 's the TV . It 's all right there . Commercials . We are not productive anymore , they do n't need us to make things anymore , it 's all automated . What are we for then ? We 're consumers . Okay , uy a lot of stuff , you 're a good citizen . But if you do n't buy a lot of stuff , you know what ? You 're mentally ill ! That 's a fact ! If you do n't buy thingstoilet paper , new cars , computerized blenders , electrically operated sexual devices
TERRY: Take it easy , Jeffrey . Be calm .
JEFFREY: So if you want to watch a particula program , say `` All My Children '' o something , you go to the Charge Nurse and tell her what day and time the show you want to see is on . But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on . There was this one guy who was always requesting shows that had already played . He could n't quite grasp the idea that the Charge Nurse could n't just make it be yesterday for him , turn ack time ha ha . What a fruitcake ! !
TERRY: Okay , that 's it , Jeffrey , you 're gon na get a shot . I warned you
JEFFREY: Right ! Right ! Carried away , heh heh . I got `` carried away '' . Explaining the workings ofthe institution .
TJ WASHINGTON: I do n't really come from outer space .
JEFFREY: This is TJ Washington , Jim he does n't really come from outer space .
TJ WASHINGTON: Do n't mock me , my friend . It 's a condition of `` mental divergence '' . I find myself on another planet , Ogo , part of an intellectual elite , preparing to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto . But even though it 's a totally convincing eality in every wayI can feel , breathe , hearnevertheless , Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche . I am mentally divergent in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here . When I stop going there , I will e well . Are you also divergent , friend ? The P.A . SYSTEM interrupts , startling COLE . P.A . SYSTEM James Cole . Report to Staff . James Cole !
JEFFREY: Staff ! Whoo ! Time for Staff . Now the geniuses cure you . Hallelujah !
COLE: This is a place for crazy people ! I 'm not crazy !
RESIDENT #1: We do n't use that term '' crazy '' , Mr. Cole .
COLE: Well , you 've got some real nuts in here ! Listen to me , all of you I have to tell you something that 's going to be difficult for you to understand , but
DR. RAILLY: Jamesplease . These are all doctors here and we want to help you .
DR. FLETCHER: Mr. Cole last night you told Dr. Railly you thought it was 1995 . How about right now ? Do you know what year it is right now ?
COLE: 1989 . Look , I 'm not confused . There 's been a mistake , I 've been sent to the wrong place .
DR. CASEY: Mr. Cole
COLE: Right . I guess you would n't , this is 1989 , they 're probably not active yet . That makes sense ! Okay . Listen to me , three billion people died in 1995 . Three billion , got that ? Almost the whole population . Of the world ! Only about one percent survived .
RESIDENT #2: Are you going to save us , Mr. Cole ?
COLE: Save you ? How can I save you ? It already happened ! I ca n't save you . I 'm simply trying to get some information fo people in the present so that someday You do n't believe me . You think I 'm crazy . But I 'm not crazy . I 'm a convict , sure , I have a quick temper , but I 'm as sane as anyone in this room . I
DR. RAILLY: Can you tell us the name of the prison you 've come from ?
DR. FLETCHER: Does this bother you , Mr. Cole ?
COLE: No ! Look , I do n't belong here ! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out .
DR. FLETCHER: Who would you call , Mr. Cole , who would straighten everything out ?
COLE: Scientists . I 'm supposed to report in to them . They 'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time .
DR. FLETCHER: So you could talk to these scientists and they do what ? Send you to the future ?
COLE: No , no . I ca n't talk to them . It 's called ,
RESIDENT #2: `` From the present . '' We 're not in the present now , Mr. Cole ?
COLE: No , no . This is the past . This has already happened . Listen
RESIDENT #3: Mr. Cole , you belong in 1995 that 's the present , is that it ?
COLE: No , 1995 is the past , too . Look
DR. FLETCHER: These scientists , Mr. Cole ? Are they doctors like ourselves ?
COLE: No ! I mean yes , but Look , I 've been given a lot of drugs but I 'm still perfectly lucid . You have to let me use the phone . One call !
MOTHER: Yes ? Whaaaaat ? `` Voice mail '' ! I do n't know what you 're talkin ' about . Is this a joke ? I do n't know any scientists . James who ? Never heard of you ! The MOTHER slams down the phone .
RAILLY: It was n't who you expected ?
COLE: It was some lady . She did n't know anything .
RAILLY: Perhaps it was a wrong number
COLE: No . That 's the reason they chose me I remember things .
RAILLY: James , where did you grow up ? Was it around here ? Around Baltimore ?
COLE: What ?
RAILLY: I have thestrangest feeling I 've met you beforea long time ago , perhaps . Were you ever ?
COLE: Wait ! This is only 1989 ! I 'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995 . It 's not the right number yet . That 's the problem . Damn ! How can I contact them ?
RAILLY: James , take these . Please I helped you like I said I would . Now I want you to trust me .
MR. PONYTAIL: WATCH IT !
WOMAN'S VOICE: NOOOOOOOOOO !
JEFFREY: You think you can remove the grill but you ca n't . It 's welded . COLE checks the grill anyway .
COLE: Germs ? !
JEFFREY: In the 18th century there was no such thing ! Nobody 'd ever imagined such a thing no sane person anyway . Along comes this doctorSemmelweiss , I think . He tries to convince people other doctors mostlythat there are these teeny tiny invisible `` bad things '' called germs that get into your body and make yousick ! He 's trying to get doctors to wash their hands . What is this guycrazy ? Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em ? `` germs '' !
COLE: I 'm not crazy .
JEFFREY: Of course not , I never thought you were . You want to escape , right ? That 's very sane . I can help you . You want me to , do n't you ? Get you out ?
COLE: If you know how to escape , why do n't you ?
JEFFREY: Why do n't I escape , that 's what you were going to ask me , right ? 'Cause I 'd be crazy to escape ! I 'm all taken care of , see ? I 've sent out word .
COLE: What 's that mean ?
JEFFREY: I 've managed to contact certain underlings , evil spirits , secretaries of secretaries , and assorted minions , who will contact my father . When he learns I 'm in this kind of place , he 'll have them transfer me to one of those
COLE: They hurt you !
JEFFREY: Not as bad as what they 're doing to kitty .
COLE: Look at those assholes , they 're asking for it ! Maybe people deserved to be wiped out !
JEFFREY: Wiping cut the human race ! That 's a great idea ! But it 's more of a long term thing right now we have to focus on more immediate goals . I did n't say a word about `` you know what '' .
COLE: What are you talking about ? ? ?
JEFFREY: You know your plan .
COLE: It 's private .
JEFFREY: A lawsuit ? You going to sue them ?
BILLINGS: Yo , James time to take your meds .
JEFFREY: Get it ? Monk - Key . Monk ! Key !
COLE: What. ? ? ?
JEFFREY: Wooooo , they really dosed you , bro . Major load ! Listen up try and get it together . Focus ! Focus ! The plan ! Remember ? I did my part .
COLE: What ? ? ?
JEFFREY: Not , `` what '' , babe ! When ! `` When ? ? ? ''
BILLINGS: God damn you , Jeffrey , quit playing the fool .
JEFFREY: LAST CHANCE ! LAST CHANCE ! HEY OW !
PATIENT: Place to go would beFlorida . The keys are lovely this tine of year .
DR. CASEY: This was in my box , but I have a slight suspicion it was n't meant for me .
RAILLY: Cole . James Cole right ?
DR. CASEY: `` I would do anything to stay here , but I must leave . Please , help me . ''
RAILLY: Poor man
DR. GOODINS: Hey , Kathryn , James Cole is one of yours , right ? RAILLY and CASEY stare at him .
DOCTOR: Just relax do n't fight it . We have to know exactly what 's there so we can
RAILLY: It 's just a shot to calm you .
COLE: No more drugs . Please
RAILLY: I have to do this , James . You 're very confused . RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE 'S skin .
DR. FLETCHER: Do n't be defensive , Kathryn , this is n't an inquisition .
RAILLY: I did n't think I was being defensive . I was just
DR. FLETCHER: He should have been in restraints . It was bad judgment on your part , plain and simple . why not just cop to it ?
RAILLY: Okay , it was bad judgment . But I have the strangest feeling about him I 've seen him somewhere and
DR. FLETCHER: Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull .
RAILLY: I said it was bad judgment ! What else do you want me to say ?
DR. FLETCHER: You see what I mean ? You 're being defensive . Is n't she being defensive , Bob ?
BILLINGS: Uh , Dr. Fletcher we got another situation .
DR. FLETCHER: He was in full restraints ? And the door was locked ?
BILLINGS: Yes , sir . Did it myself .
DR. FLETCHER: And he was fully sedated ?
RAILLY: He was fully sedated !
DR. FLETCHER: Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated , fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent , replaced the grill behind him and that he 's wriggling through the ventilation system right now ?
P.A. SYSTEM: Flight 784 to San Francisco now oarding at Gate 38
WOMAN'S VOICE: NOOOOOOOOOO !
ASTROPHYSICIST: Well ?
COLE: Uh , what ?
ENGINEER: He 's drugged out of his mind ! He 's completely zoned out .
ASTROPHYSICIST: Cole , did you or did you not record that message ?
COLE: Uh , that messageme ?
MICROBIOLOGIST: It 's a digital reconstruction of a message , Cole , from a weak signal on ou contact number . Did you make that call ?
COLE: I could n't call ! You sent me to the wrong year ! It was 1989 .
SCIENTISTS: 1989 !
ZOOLOGIST: You 're certain of that ?
GEOLOGIST: What did you do with your time , Cole ? Did you waste it on drugs ? Women ?
COLE: They forced me to take drugs .
BOTANIST: Forced you ! Why would someone force you to take drugs ?
COLE: I got into trouble . I got arrested . But I still got you a specimen a spider but I did n't have anyplace to put it , so I ate it . It was the wrong year anyway , so I guess it does n't matter .
ENGINEER: What about it , Cole ?
ZOOLOGIST: Did you see it ?
COLE: Uh , no , sir . I
ASTROPHYSICIST: What about these people ? Did you see any of these people ?
COLE: Uh , I think so . In the mental hospital .
MICRO3IOLOGIST: You were in a mental institution ? !
ASTROPHYSICIST: You were sent to make very important observations !
BOTANIST: You could have made a real contribution .
GEOLOGIST: Helped to reclaim the planet
ZOOLOGIST: As well as reducing your sentence .
MICROBIOLOGIST: The question is , Cole `` Do you want another chance ? ''
COLE: Where are you ? RASPY VOICE You can talk ! Wah'dja do , Bobby boy ? Volunteer ?
GEOLOGIST: No mistakes this time , Cole .
ASTROPHYSICIST: Stay alert . Keep your eyes open .
ZOOLOGIST: Good thinking about that spider , Cole . Try and do something like that again .
MICROBIOLOGIST: Just relax now do n't fight it . We have to know exactly what 's there so we can fix it .
SERGEANT: Where 's your mask ? ! And your clothes and your weapon , you idiot ? !
COLE: What ? What ? ?
SERGEANT: Captain ! A Kraut ! We got a Kraut !
COLE: I do n't understand . Where am I ?
CAPTAIN: How 'd you get here , soldier ? What 's your rank ? Where are your clothes ?
COLE: Ido n't understand .
CAPTAIN: German ! Speak German ! What are you doing here ? VOICE I got ta find 'em . I got ta find 'em . Please , you got ta help me ! COLE turns , sees
COLE: JOSE !
JOSE: Cole ! Oh , God , Cole , where are we ?
DR. PETERS: I think , Dr. Railly , you have given your alarmists a bad name . Surely there is very real and very convincing data that the planet can not survive the excesses of the human race proliferation of atomic devices , uncontrolled breeding habits , the rape of the environment , the pollution of land , sea , and air . In this context , is n't it obvious that `` Chicken Little '' represents the sane vision and that Homo Sapiens ' motto , `` Let 's go shopping ! '' is the cry of the true lunatic ?
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR: Doctor Railly please ! I wonder if you 're aware of my own studies which indicate that certain cycles of the moon actually impact on the incidence of apocalyptic predictions as observed in urban emergency rooms and
MARILOU: You were great .
RAILLY: You 're leaving ?
MARILOU: The reservation 's at nine thirty it 's getting late .
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR: Doctor Railly please this is very important !
WAYNE CHANG: You sure you 're gon na be all right ?
RAILLY: I 'll be there in twenty minutes .
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR: Dr. Railly , I simply can not understand your exclusion of the moon in relation to apocalyptic dementia
MAN'S VOICE: Get in !
RAILLY: You can have my purse . I have a lot of cash and credit MAN 'S VOICE Start the car .
MAN: START THE CAR ! NOW !
RAILLY: Where where are we going '
MAN: I need you to drive me to Philadelphia .
RAILLY: But that 's that 's more than 200 miles !
MAN: That 's why I ca n't walk there . Turn here I think
RAILLY: If you make me go with you , it 's kidnapping . That 's a serious crime . If you let me go , you could just take the car and
MAN: I do n't know how to drive ! We went underground when I was nine , I told you that . When you come to the corner , turn right . Startled , RAILLY whirls , looks right at him .
RAILLY: Cole ! James Cole ! You escaped from a locked room six years ago .
COLE: 1989 . Six years for you . There 's the sign ! Right here ! COLE is indicating a freeway entrance . RAILLY turns the wheel sharply .
RAILLY: I ca n't believe this is a coincidence , Mr. Cole . Have you beenfollowing me ?
COLE: You told me you 'd help me . I know this
RAILLY: Yes , I remember . Why do you want to go to Philadelphia ?
COLE: It 's the next step . I checked out the Baltimore information , it was nothing . It 's Philadelphia , that 's where they are , the ones who killed everyone . Zs that a radio ? Does it play music ?
RAILLY: It 's an advertisement , Mr. Cole . You do understand that , do n't you ? It 's not really a special message to you .
COLE: You used to call me `` James '' .
RAILLY: You 'd prefer that ? Jamesyou do n't really have a gun , do you .
COLE: Everybody 's got a gun . In this city
RAILLY: What ?
COLE: My father told me that . `` Never cry wolf . '' Then people wo n't believe you ifsomething really happens .
RAILLY: `` If something really happens '' like what , James ?
COLE: Something bad . Is that all the music ? I do n't want to hear this stuff RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations .
RAILLY: Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child ? Something so bad ?
COLE: Ohhhh , that one ! Can we hear that one ?
ANSWERING MACHINE: Dr. Railly this is Palmer from Psych Admitting . There was a guy here this afternoon looking for you . He seemed very agitated . We tried to keep him , but he refused ' n I kept thinking , I know this guy . Then , just a few minutes ago , it came to me . It 's Cole ! James Cole . Remember him ? The paranoid who pulled the Houdini back in '89 . Well , he 's ack and he'scuckooand he 's looking for you . I thought you oughta know .
MARILOU MARTIN: It 's just as I told you my husband and I had gone ahead she neve showed . That 's totally unlike her !
OFFICER TWO: Do you happen to know the make of her car ?
MARILOU MARTIN: UmAcura'92 Acura . Also , that cat 's starving ! She would never neglect her cat !
COLE: You were in my dream just now . Your hai was different , but I 'm sure it was you .
RAILLY: We dream about what 's important in our lives . And I seem to have become pretty important in yours . What was the dream about ?
COLE: About an airportbefore everything happened . It 's the same dream I always have the only one . I 'm a little kid in it .
RAILLY: And I was in it ? What did I do ?
COLE: You were very upset . You 're always very upset in the dream , but I neve knew it was you before .
RAILLY: It was n't me before , James . It 's ecome me now because ofwhat 's happening . Please untie me .
COLE: No , I think it was always you . It 's very strange .
RAILLY: You 're flushed . And you were moaning . I think you 're running a fever . What are you doing ?
COLE: I 'll be back in a minute . He heads for the door .
RAILLY: No ! Do n't leave me here like this !
TV ANCHORMAN: And in Fresno , Californiacrews continue to attempt to rescue nine yea old Ricky Neuman .
COLE: My notes . Observations . Clues .
RAILLY: Clues ? What kind of clues ?
COLE: A secret army . The Army of The Twelve Monkeys . I 've told you about them . They spread the virus . That 's why we have to get to Philadelphia . I have to find them it 's my assignment .
RAILLY: What will you dowhen you find thissecret army ?
COLE: I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates . So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure . So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth .
RAILLY: Does that disturb you , James ? Thinking about that little boy in the well ?
COLE: When I was a kid I identified with that kid , down there alone in that pipea hundred feet down does n't know if they 're going to save him .
RAILLY: What do you mean when you were a kid ?
COLE: Nevermind . It 's not real it 's a hoax . A prank . He 's hiding in a barn . Hey , turn left here . Left !
EVANGELIST: `` And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged . ''
COLE: Where I come from we think of this as Eden . If we could just see the sun , eat sun-grown food . Eden ! Look at them ! They donut know what they have . They do n't see the sky . They do n't feel the air !
RAILLY: I 'm not going to `` do '' anything , I promise . But you need help , James . None of this is what you think it is .
LOUIE: No , sir , Old Bob do n't even try . They hear everything . They got that tracking device on you . They can find you anywhere . Anytime . Ha Ha !
COLE: They 're keeping an eye on me .
RAILLY: Who 's keeping an eye on you ?
COLE: The manwith the voice . I recognized him . He 's from the present . He COLE breaks off , freezes as he sees
RAILLY: James , no we should n't be here !
FIRST THUG: Hey , buddy . Startled , COLE turns to face them .
SECOND THUG: Stick around , bitch .
COLE: Please ! Please do n't hurt me !
RAILLY: Uh , no . Yes . I mean , just some scrapes
COLE: Come an . We 're running out of time . You ca n't help him .
RAILLY: Oh , Jesus , James ! You killed him !
COLE: I did him a favor . Now come on .
RAILLY: You did n't have a gun before , did you ?
COLE: I 've got one now .
EVANGELIST: You ! You ! You 're one of us , are n't you ? But COLE has stopped and is staring at
FALE: Uh , can we help you ?
RAILLY: It 's all right , James it 's just a tape .
COLE: I , uh , I 'm looking for the , ah , the Army of the Twelve Monkeys .
TEDDY: We do n't know anything about any `` Army of the Twelve Monkeys '' , so why do n't you and your friend disappear , okay ?
COLE: I just need some information
TEDDY: Did n't you hear me ? We 're not TEDDY breaks off mid-sentencefreezes .
RAILLY: James , no do n't hurt them . Please , I 'm a psychiatrist just do whatever he tells you to do . He 's upset disturbed . Please he 's dangerous just cooperate . MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up .
FALE: What do you want money ? We only have a few bucks .
COLE: I told you what I want . Lock the door !
RAILLY: James , why do n't we ?
COLE: Lock it now !
BEN: I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this .
FALE: Shut up !
COLE: Mason ? ? ?
RAILLY: Jeffrey Mason ?
BEN: Yeah , tucking , crazy Jeffrey Mason .
FALE: Then , Jeffrey becomes like thisbig star the media latch on to him ecause he 's picketing his own father , a `` famous Nobel Prize winning virologist '' . You musta seen all that on TV .
COLE: No , I do n't watch TV .
FALE: That 's him .
BEN: What are you going to do with us ?
COLE: Tell me more about Jeffrey .
FALE: Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we dopicketing , leafleting , letter-writing stuff . He said we were , `` ineffectual liberal jerkoffs '' . He wanted to do guerrilla `` actions '' to `` educate '' the public .
TEDDY: But we were n't into that kind of stuff . It 's counter productive , we told him .
FALE: So he and eleven others split off and ecame this underground '' army ''
COLE: The Army of The Twelve Monkeys .
BEN: They started planning a `` Human Hunt '' .
TEDDY: They bought stun guns and nets and bea traps . They were gon na go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers
BEN: But they did n't do it . They did n't do any of it .
TEDDY: Yeah , just like always , Mr. Big Shot sold his friends out !
COLE: What 's that mean ?
FALE: He goes on TV , gives a news conference , tells the whole world he just realized his daddy 's experiments are vital fo humanity and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary and that he , Jeffrey Mason , from now on , is going to personally supervise the labs to make sure all the little animals are n't going to suffer .
COLE: What 's this ?
RAILLY: If those young men do n't get loose , they could die in that basement .
COLE: All I see are dead people . Everywhere . What 's three more ?
RAILLY: You know Dr. Mason 's son , Jeffrey Mason , do n't you , James ? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago . COLE is studying the map again .
COLE: The guy was a total fruitcake .
RAILLY: And he told you then his father was a famous virologist .
COLE: No he said his father was `` God '' !
RAILLY: This ca n't go on , James . You 're not well . You 're burning with fever .
COLE: We need gas .
RAILLY: I thought you did n't know how to drive .
COLE: I said I was too young to drive . I did n't say I was stupid .
RAILLY: What 's the matter with your leg ?
COLE: I got shot . Look there 's a gas station up ahead .
RAILLY: Shot ! Who shot you ?
COLE: It was some kind ofwar . Never mind , you would n't believe me . Turn off here .
RAILLY: No . I want you to turn yourself in , James It 'll go much better for you if you do but I 'm not going to trick you .
COLE: That has your name on it . Give him cash .
RAILLY: You can come with me . I have to get some things . Scissors , bandages , some alcohol or whiskey . I have to look at your leg , James . I 'm a doctor .
COLE: I love seeing the sun . A beat . COLE tries to stand up .
RAILLY: Wait let me help you .
COLE: You smell so good .
RAILLY: You have to give yourself up , you know .
COLE: I have to do something now . Something I do n't want to do . I 'm so sorry .
FIRST AGENT: They find him ?
SECOND AGENT: Who ? ?
FIRST AGENT: That kid . The one in the pipe .
SECOND AGENT: You believe this ? They 're dropping a monkey down there with a miniature infra-red camera strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich wrapped in tinfoil .
FIRST AGENT: You 're making that up !
DR. MASON: Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner and this excellent and stimulating company for itself , with no sense of purpose . But alas , I am `` burdened '' with the sense that with all this excess of public attention and this cacophony of praise , there comes great responsibility . Indeed , I practically feel a soapbox growing under my feet whenever I stand for more than a few seconds .
JEFFREY: What are you talking about ? What friend ? I 'm not expecting anyone .
DR. MASON: Current genetic engineering as well as my own work with viruses has presented us with powers as terrifying as any
JEFFREY: This is ridiculous . My father is making a major address .
AGENT #3: Normally if we caught a guy sneaking around like this with no I.D. , we 'd ust his ass , excuse the French , but this one said he knows you and , since you seem to have had someuhunusualuh '' associates '' , we certainly did n't want to arrest one of your , uh , closestpals .
JEFFREY: Never saw him before in my life . Go ahead and shoot him or torture him o whatever it is you do .
COLE: You do know me . You helped me once .
JEFFREY: That would be totally out of character . Helping people is against my principles . See , he definitely does n't know me . Now , I 'm going to go back and listen to my father 's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS
COLE: I 'm here about some monkeys .
JEFFREY: Excuse me what did you say ?
COLE: Monkeys . Twelve of them .
JEFFREY: ArnoldArnold . COLE is astonished . The AGENTS are , too .
AGENT #3: You know this man ?
JEFFREY: Of course I know him . What do you think I act like this to strangers ? Listen you fellas are terrific . I thought you were pulling a number on me . What a terrible thing if you 'd thrown old Arnie out . I owe you guys the big apologia ! Mea culpa , fellas . Christ , Arnie , it 's black tie ! I mean , I said , `` drop by , '' but , like , this is Dad 's big `` do '' vips , senators , secret service , andand everything .
AGENT #4: `` Arnie ? ''
JEFFREY: Arnold Pettibone . Old Arnie Pettibone . Used to be my best friend . Still is . What 've you lost , Arnie forty pounds ? No wonder I did n't know you . You hungry ? Lots of dead cow , dead lamb , dead pig . Real killer feast we 're putting on tonight .
AGENT #4: These people all of 'em are true weirdoes !
AGENT #3: I 'm gon na call in a description of this `` Pettibone '' character . You go keep an eye on him . Make sure he does n't do one of the guests with a fork .
JEFFREY: Hey , nice ta see ya . Lookin ' good ! Hi , there . Yes , it has been a long time .
COLE: Listen to me I ca n't do anything about what you 're going to do . I ca n't change anything . I ca n't stop you . I just want some information
JEFFREY: We need to talk . Come on . Upstairs . I am a new person ! I 'm completely adjusted . Witness the tux . It 's Armani . Who chattered ? Goines ? Weller ?
COLE: I just need to have access to the pure virus , that 's all ! For the future !
JEFFREY: Come on , follow me . You do n't lock so good .
COLE: I do n't have time to go upstairs . The police are looking for me . I need to know where it is and exactly what it is .
JEFFREY: I get it ! This is your old plan , right ?
COLE: Plan ? What are you talking about ?
JEFFREY: Remember ? We were in the dayroom , watching TV , and you were all upset about thedesecration of the planet . And you said to me , `` Would n't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are ? '' You do remember that , do n't you ?
COLE: Bulishit ! You 're fucking with my head !
JEFFREY: And that 's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said , `` Hey , he could make a germ and we could steal it ! ''
COLE: Listen , you dumb fuck ! The thing mutates We live underground ! The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats . We 're like moles or worms . All we want to do is study the original
AGENT #4: Let 's go somewhere and talk this thing over . Okay ? Just come with me
JEFFREY: You 're right ! Absolutely right . Me 's a nut case , totally deranged . Delusional ! Paranoid . HIS PROCESSOR 'S ALL FUCKED
AGENT #3: Take it easy , Mr. Mason , we 've got him . Everything 's
JEFFREY: MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS . YOU 'VE `` PROCESSED '' THAT INFORMATION THROUGH YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND LO AND BEHOLD , I 'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE `` ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS '' BECOMES SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY CABAL . THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT ! YOU KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM ? ? ?
AGENT #4: Did a man just come through herelimping ?
COLE: LIGHTS ! LIGHTS !
PILOT: There ! He 's showing lights .
POLICE OFFICER: He 's not in here .
RAILLY: You bastard ! You total bastard !
COLE: III 'm really sorry .
RAILLY: What have you done ? Did youkill someone ?
COLE: No ! Ido n't think so . I stole a ca and they chased me . I hit a tree .
RAILLY: See you can drive after all !
COLE: Yeah , sort of , I guess . II 'm sorry I locked you up . I thoughtI thought I think maybe I am crazy !
RAILLY: What made you think that ?
COLE: Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus . And suddenly , I was n't sure . We talked when I was in the institution , and it was allfuzzy . The drugs and stuff . You think maybe I 'm the one who wiped out the human race ? It was my idea ?
RAILLY: Nobody is going to wipe out the human ace . Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else . You 've created something in you mind , James a substitute reality . In order to avoid something you do n't want to face .
COLE: I 'm '' mentally divergent '' . I would love to believe that .
RAILLY: It can be dealt with , but only if you want to . I can help you .
COLE: I need help all right . They 're coming after me .
RAILLY: First , it 's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running . Okay ?
COLE: It would be great if I 'm crazy . If I 'm wrong about everythingthe world will be okay . I 'll never have to live underground .
RAILLY: Give me the gun .
COLE: The gun ! I lost it
RAILLY: You 're sure ?
COLE: No gun ! Stars ! Air ! I can live here . Breathe ! RAILLY starts around to the front of the car .
RAILLY: I 'm going to attract their attention , let them know where we are , okay ?
COLE: I love this world !
RAILLY: Remember , I 'm going to help you . I 'll stay with you . I wo n't let them
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN: You lucked out . For a while we thought you were a body they found down state mutilated .
RAILLY: He would n't do something like that he
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN: This the man he attacked ?
RAILLY: I 'd like to be clear about this . That man and the other one were '' severely '' eating us . James Cole did n't start it . In fact he saved me !
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN: Funny thing , Doctor , maybe you can explain it to me , you being a psychiatrist why do kidnap victims almost always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed 'em and try to make us understand how kind these bastards really were ?
RAILLY: It 's a normal reaction to a life- threatening situation . He 's sick . He thinks he comes from the future . He 's been living in a carefully constructed fantasy world and that world is starting to disintegrate . He needs help !
ASTROPHYSICIST: Come on , Cole , cooperate !
GEOLOGIST: Spit it out you went to the home of a famous virologist
COLE: Youdon'texist ! You 're in my mind
WAYNE: Sorry .
RAILLY: No I 'm in a state of hyper- alertness . I ca n't sleep .
MARILOU: Did you take the sedative ?
RAILLY: I hate those things . They mess my head up .
WAYNE: He 's fine . It was just a `` prank '' he and his friends pulled .
SCIENTISTS: -found my thrills on Blueberry Hill
BOTANIST: During your `` interview , '' while you were '' under the influence , '' you told us you liked music !
ZOOLOGIST: This is n't the prison , James .
BOTANIST: This is a hospital .
ASTROPHYSICIST: But just until you recover your , uh , equilibrium .
ENGINEER: You 're still a little disoriented .
GEOLOGIST: Stress ! Time travel !
ASTROPHYSICIST: You stood up very well , considering
GEOLOGIST: Superior work ! Superior !
BOTANIST: You connected the Army of the 12 Monkeys to a world famous virologist and his son
MICROBIOLOGIST: Others will take over now
ZOOLOGIST: We 'll be back on the surface in a matter of months .
GEOLOGIST: We 'll retake the planet .
ASTROPHYSICIST: We 're very close ! Because of you !
ENGINEER: This is it , Jameswhat you 've been working for .
BOTANIST: A full pardon !
MICROBIOLOGIST: You 'll be out of here in no time .
ASTROPHYSICIST: Women will want to get to know you
COLE: I DO N'T WANT YOUR `` WOMEN , '' YOU BRAINLESS TWIT ! I WANT TO BE WELL !
ASTROPHYSICIST: Of course you want to be well , James . And you will besoon . COLE bursts into hysterical laughter .
COLE: YOU DO N'T EXIST , YOU SILLY BOZOS ! YOU 'RE NOT REAL ! HA HA HA ! PEOPLE DO N'T TRAVEL IN TIME ! YOU ARE N'T HERE . MADE YOU UP ! YOU CA N'T TRICK ME ! YOU 'RE IN MY MIND ! I 'M INSANE AND YOU 'RE MY INSANITY !
RAILLY: He not only used the word `` prank '' he said the boy was hiding in a barn .
DR. FLETCHER: He kidnapped you , Kathryn . You saw him murder someone . You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you , too . You were under tremendous emotional stress .
RAILLY: For God sakes , Owen , listen to me he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die !
DR. FLETCHER: Kathryn , you know he ca n't possibly know that . You 're a rational person . You 're a trained psychiatrist . You know the difference between what 's real and what 's not .
RAILLY: And what we believe is what 's accepted as `` truth '' now , is n't it , Owen ? Psychiatry it 's the latest religion . And we 're the priests we decide what 's right and what 's
COLE: I saw you ! In 1995 ! In the real world ! You were a bum ! You pulled out your teeth . RASPY VOICE Why would I pull out my teeth , Bob ? They do n't like that . That 's a no-no . And when did you say you saw me ? In1872 ?
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN: Dr. Railly ? Jim Halperin , Philly P.D.. Sorry to call so early but
RAILLY: You found him ? Is he all right ?
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN: Au contraire , Doctor . No sign of you good friend , the kidnapper . However , the plot thickens . I have a ballistic eport on my desk that says the bullet you claim you removed from Mr. Cole 's thigh is an antiqueand all indications are it was firedsometime prior to 1920 . ANGLE ON RAILLY , reacting , stunned . ANGLE ON HALPERIN , continuing soberly now ,
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN: So what I was thinking was , maybe if I sent a detective down there to talk with you , you could maybe revise o amplify on the circumstances . Hello ? Hello ? Dr. Railly ?
RAILLY: No !
ASTROPHYSICIST: The food , the sky , the certain , uh , sexual temptations you have n't ecome `` addicted '' have you , Cole ? To that `` dying '' world '
COLE: No , sir ! I just want to do my part . To get us back on topin charge of the planet . And I have the experience , I know who the people are
BIOLOGIST: He really is the most qualified
GEOLOGIST: But all that '' behavior ''
ASTROPHYSICIST: You said we were n't `` real , '' Cole
COLE: Well , sir , I do n't think the human mind was built to exist in two different whatever you call it '' dimensions . '' It 's stressful , you said it yourselves , it gets you confused . You do n't know what 's real and what 's not .
MICROBIOLOGIST: But you know what 's real now ?
COLE: Yes , sir .
GEOLOGIST: He 'd have to bone up , catch up to ou esearch , the latest clues
ZOOLOGIST: He 's proved to be a quick study
ASTROPHYSICIST: You ca n't trick us , you know . It would n't work .
BIOLOGIST: And why would you want to ? It 'll be dangerously close to the end .
COLE: I understand . There 'd be no point .
ASTROPHYSICIST: We 're going to think about it , Cole . Among ourselves . We 'll get back to you .
DR. MASON: You have reason to believe that my son may be planning to do what ? ! ! !
RAILLY: Please , I know it sounds insane but
DR. MASON: I 'm afraid this does n't seem very professional to me , in fact it 's distressingly unprofessional for some- one who treated my son briefly to take a sudden unsolicited interest in his mental health six years later , and to telephone a parent to express opinions that would be inappropriate I do n't know anything about `` Monkey armies '' , Doctor . Nothing whatsoever . If my son ever was involved in It would be doubly inappropriate to discuss matters of security with you , Dr. Railly , but if it will put you at ease , neither my son nor any othe unauthorized person has access to any potentially dangerous organisms in this laboratory . Thank you for your concern . DR. MASON hangs up angrily and glares . DR. MASON 'S ASSISTANT Dr. `` Kathryn '' Railly ? ? ? ?
BOTANIST: Let 's consider again our current information if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28 , 1995 , that makes us know that ?
COLE: It was released in Philadelphia , probably on June 14 , 1995 .
BOTANIST: And it appeared sequentially after that in ?
COLE: San Francisco , New Orleans , Rio de Janeiro , Rome , Kinshasa , Karachi , Bangkok , then Peking .
BOTANIST: Meaning ? ? ?
COLE: That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco , then to New Orleans , Rio de Janeiro , Rome , Kinshasa , Karachi , Bangkok , then Peking .
BOTANIST: And your only goal is ? ? ?
COLE: To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus .
BOTANIST: So that ? ? ?
COLE: Uh , so that a vaccine can be developed that will , uh , allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth .
RAILLY: IS ANYBODY IN THERE ? HELLO ? IS SOMEONE IN THERE ? IF YOU 'RE IN THERE , I NEED TO TALK TO YOU .
FALE: It 's the kidnap woman the one who was with the guy who tied us up .
BEN: What 's she doing ?
FALE: She 's drawing attention to us , that 's what she 's doing . I do n't know what you 're up to this time , Mason , but you 're gon na get us in deep shit !
JEFFREY: Whine , whine , whine . What about walkie talkies ? We used to have walkie talkies .
RAILLY: I SAW YOU ! I SAW SOMEONE MOVING . I KNOW YOU 'RE IN THERE !
LOUIE: That 's what they do secret weird stuff !
RAILLY: You ! I know you !
LOUIE: Not just on them . Do 'em on people , too down at the shelters . Feed 'em chemicals ' n take pictures of 'em .
RAILLY: Have you seen James Cole ? The man ?
LOUIE: They 're watchin ' you . Takin ' pictures . RAILLY follows his look .
RAILLY: The police . I know . Listen , I need to talk to James , but he has to be careful how he contacts me . He must n't get caught . Do you understand me ?
LOUIS: Uh , yeah , sure . Uhwho 's James ?
RAILLY: He was with me , he spoke to you . Several weeks ago . He said you were from the futurewatching him .
JEFFREY: You get the bolt cutters ?
KWESKIN: One dozen . They 're in the van .
FALE: One dozen bolt cutters ! Whadda you gon na do with one dozen bolt cutters ?
JEFFREY: You really want to know ?
FALE: No ! Absolutely not . Do n't tell me anything .
BEN: Hey ! Do you know what she 's doing ?
TEDDY: What 's it say ?
BEN: I ca n't see it .
FALE: Your psychiatrist ? Did you just say , `` your psychiatrist '' ?
JEFFREY: Ex-psychiatrist ! Now , what about flashlights ? How many flashlights ?
FALE: That woman iswasyour psychiatrist ? And now she 's spray- painting our building ?
COLE: Kathryn !
RAILLY: James !
COLE: No , I want to turn myself in . Where is he ? Do n't worry it 's all okay now . I 'm not crazy any more ! I mean , I am crazy , mentally divergent , actually , ut I know it now and I want you to help me . I want to get well
RAILLY: James put your hands down and listen to me . Things have changed !
COLE: I 've seen thatbefore .
RAILLY: James , trust me . We 're in terrible trouble . We have to run .
BEN: Wow , a guy in a Chevy is chasing he and some other guy I ca n't see .
FALE: Hey , no problem , it 's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey 's shrink , pardon me , make that ex-shrink . This is your leader , a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes , and now who knows what she 's painted out there on our wall ?
JEFFREY: WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS ? You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys ? Impossible ! Know why , you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous `` pretend-friend-to- animals '' ? ! I 'll tell you why because when I had anything to do with her six years ago , there was no such thing I had n't even thought of it yet !
FALE: Then how come she knows what 's going on ?
JEFFREY: Here 's my theory on that . While I was institutionalized , my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health . I was interrogated , x-rayed , studied thoroughly . Then , everything about me was entered into a computer where they created a model of my mind .
FALE: He 's seriously crazy you know that .
RAILLY: James ! Come on .
COLE: I do n't understand what we 're doing .
RAILLY: We 're avoiding the police until I can.talk to you .
COLE: You mean , treat me ? Cure me ? Kathryn , those words on the wall I 've seen them before IIdreamed them .
DESK CLERK: Twenty five bucks an hour .
RAILLY: An hour ? !
DESK CLERK: You want quarter hours , go someplace else .
RAILLY: Here 's ninety eight . For the night . Deal ?
DESK CLERK: Forty four . Fourth floor , turn right . Elevator 's busted .
RAILLY: Okayyou were standing there looking at the moonyou were eating grass then what ?
COLE: I thought I was inprison again .
RAILLY: Just like that ? You were in prison ?
COLE: No , not really . It'sit 's in my mind . Like you said .
RAILLY: You disappeared ! One minute you were there , the next minute you were gone . Did you run through the woods ?
COLE: I do n't know I do n't remember .
RAILLY: The boy in the well . How did you know that was just a hoax ?
COLE: It was ? I didn'tknow .
RAILLY: James , you said he was hiding in the barn
COLE: I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid . Where a boy
RAILLY: IT WAS N'T A TV SHOW ! IT WAS REAL !
COLE: Well , maybe that kid saw the same TV show and copied it . Listen , you were ight , it 's all in my head . I 'm mentally ill , I imagine all that stuff . I know they 're not real , I can trick them , make them do what I want . I just worked on them in my head and I got back here . I can get better . I can stay here .
RAILLY: What does this mean to you ?
COLE: I had a dream aboutsomething like that .
RAILLY: You had a bullet from World War One in your leg , James ! How did it get there ?
COLE: You said I had delusions that I created a world you said you could explain everything
RAILLY: Well , I ca n't . I meanI 'm trying to . I ca n't believe that everything we do or say has already happened , that we ca n't change what 's going to happen , that I 'm one of the three billion people who are going to diesoon . COLE stands , moves close to her .
COLE: I want to be here . In this time . With you . I want to becomebecome a whole person . I want this to be the present . I want the future to be unknown .
RAILLY: Jamesdo you remembersix years agoyou had a phone number ! You tried to call and
WALLACE: This is my territory , bitch !
COLE: Is this real or is this one of my delusions ?
RAILLY: This is definitely real Excuse me , I think we have a little misunderstanding here
WALLACE: What 're you some kind of tough guy ? You wan na be a hero ? You gon na try and mess with me ? Come on
RAILLY: JAMES DO N'T !
WALLACE: Youheardher . Do n't do it , man .
RAILLY: Put him in the closet , But get his money first .
COLE: You want me to rob him ?
RAILLY: IIWe need cash , James .
WALLACE: You two are crazy . I got friends . You put me in a closet , they 're gon na be eally pissed .
RAILLY: James , no !
WALLACE: I have friends , man if you cut me
RAILLY: Oh , my God , James . Did you kill him ?
COLE: Justjust in case . In case I 'm not crazy That 's how they find us . By our teeth . I do n't want them to find me . Ever . I do n't want to go back .
RAILLY: Push it tight ! WALLACE 'S VOICE
PLAINCLOTHES COP: POLICE ! THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND COME OUTTA THERE !
RAILLY: Wait here . I 'm going to try that phone number . Let 's hope it 's nothing !
COLE: A Carpet Cleaning Company ?
RAILLY: No superiors ! No scientists . No people from the future . It 's just a Carpet Cleaning Company . They have voice mail you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned .
COLE: You you left them a message ?
RAILLY: I could n't resist . I was so relieved . Wait 'll they hear this nutty woman telling themthey better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys
COLE: `` The Army of the Twelve Monkeys they 're the ones who are going to do it . I ca n't do anything more . The police are watching me . ''
RAILLY: You you could n't have heard me .
COLE: They got your message , Kathryn . They played it for me . It was a bad ecordingdistorted . I did n't ecognize your voice .
RAILLY: Come on .
CLERK: Shall I put this on your account , Ma'am ?
RAILLY: No I 'll pay cash . The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills !
KWESKIN: So then he goes into this incredible riff about how his shrink , like , replicated his brain while he was in the nut house . Turned it into a computer .
WELLER: And Fale believed it ?
KWESKIN: Oh , you know Fale ! He 's like , `` If you guys get nailed and I 'm sure you will I never saw you before in nay life ! ''
JEFFREY: Let 's do it !
GOINES: What 's the harm in opening the bag ? His eyes are taped .
SANDY: Yeah , it 's cruel leaving him like that .
JEFFREY: Ah , but cruelty is his specialty .
ICHIOKA: So why should we be like him ?
JEFFREY: Want the full effect ?
DR. MASON: Jeffrey ? I know it 's you , Jeffrey . I ecognize your voice .
JEFFREY: Whatvirus ?
DR. MASON: She knew about it , Jeffrey . She knew you were going to try this .
JEFFREY: What virus are we talking about , Dad ?
DR. MASON: You 're insane , Jeffrey .
JEFFREY: You `` develop '' viruses and you 're calling me insane ? Typical . What does this virus attack ? Do n't tell me , you sick fuck , it does n't matter . Have I ever `` developed '' a virus ? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli ? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine thei owel movements ? Wow ! And I 'm crazy !
DR. MASON: Please tell me , Jeffrey , what exactly are you going to do ? I do n't have to tell you I 'm afraid .
JEFFREY: THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT ! YOU 'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL , DADDY . GOT THAT ? NOW WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH , YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC ?
RAILLY: Here , let me help you .
COLE: I think I 've seen this movie before . When I was a kid . It was on TV .
RAILLY: Shh do n't talk . Hold still .
COLE: I have seen it , but I do n't remembe this part . Funny , it 's like what 's happening to us , like the past . The movie never changes it ca n't change but everytime you see it , it seems to be different because you 're different you notice different things .
RAILLY: If we ca n't change anythingbecause it 's already happened , then we ought to at least smell the flowers .
COLE: Flowers ! What flowers ?
RAILLY: It 's an expression . Here
COLE: Why are we doing this ?
RAILLY: So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music . So we can appreciate what we have while we have it . Forgive me , psychiatrists do n't cry .
COLE: But maybe I 'm wrong . Maybe you 're wrong . Maybe we 're both crazy .
RAILLY: In a few weeks , it will have started o it wo n't . If there are still baseball games and traffic jams , armed robberies and boring TV shows we 'll be so happy , we 'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police .
SHADOWY MOVIEGOER: SHHHHHHH
COLE: Where can we hide for a few weeks ?
RAILLY: You said you 'd never seen the ocean
COLE: Kathryn ? !
BRUNETTE: We 're booked on a 9 30 flight to Key West .
COLE: You were in my dream just now . I did n't recognize you .
RAILLY: Well , you look pretty different , too .
COLE: I mean in my dream I did n't realize it was you . ThenI woke up and II thought you were gone .
RAILLY: I remember youlike this . I feel I 've known you before . I feel I 've always known you .
WOMAN CABBIE: Might be tight .
RAILLY: Tight ? My watch says 7 30 .
WOMAN CABBIE: On your normal mornin ' , okay , plenty a time , but today , got ta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor .
RAILLY: What ? What did you say ?
WOMAN CABBIE: Twelve Monkeys , honey . Guess you folks did n't turn on your radio this morning . COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look .
RAILLY: That 's what they were up to ! Freeing animals !
COLE: On the walls they meant the animals when they said , `` We did it . ''
WOMAN CABBIE: You can hear it on the radio all the stations
RAILLY: Maybe it 's going to be okay .
DETECTIVE: Tell your people if they spot eithe one of them , not to try and apprehend then . They should notify us and
P.A. SYSTEM: Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready for boarding at Gate Seventeen .
COLE: I know this place ! This is my dream .
RAILLY: Airports all look the same . Maybe it 's James ! Your moustache ! It 's slipping .
COLE: It 's not just my dream . I was actually here ! I remember now . My parents ought me to meet my uncle . About a week or two beforebeforebefore everybody started dying . RAILLY glances around nervously .
RAILLY: They may be looking for us , James . Use this . You can fix it in the Men 's Room .
COLE: I was hereas a kid . I think you were here , too . But youlooked just like you look now .
RAILLY: James , if we 're identified , they 're going to send us someplacebut not to Key West !
COLE: Right ! You 're right . I have to fix this .
RAILLY: I 'll get the tickets and meet you in the Gift Shop .
COLE: Listen , I do n't know whether you 're there or not . Maybe you just clean carpets . If you do , you 're lucky you 're gon na live a long , happy life . But if you other guys exist and you 're picking this up forget about the Army of The Twelve Monkeys they did n't do it . It was a mistake ' Someone else did it . The Army of The Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids playing revolutionaries . It was someone else !
TICKET AGENT: Do n't see a lot of this cash .
RAILLY: It'sa long story .
TICKET AGENT: They 'll begin boarding in about twenty minutes . Have a nice flight , Mrs. Simmons .
COLE: Leave me alone ! I made a report . I did n't have to do that . RASPY VOICE Point of fact you do n't belong here . It 's not permitted to let you stay .
PLUMP MAN: Anything you say , chief . It 's none of my business .
TICKET AGENT: Woooo-eeee . San Francisco , New Orleans , Rio de Janeiro , Rome , Kinshasa , Karachi , Bangkok , Peking ! That 's some trip you 're taking , sir , All in one week ! MR. PONYTAIL Business .
COLE: JoJose ? ? ? ?
JOSE: Pulling out the tooth , man , that was nuts ! Here , take this .
COLE: What ? What for ? Are you crazy ?
JOSE: Me ? Are you kiddin ? You 're the one ! You were a hero , man . They gave you a pardon ! And whadda you do ? You come ack and fuck with your teeth ! Wow !
COLE: How did you find me ?
JOSE: The phone call , man . The phone call .
COLE: The call I just made ? Five minutes ago ?

DR. PETERS: Is n't it obvious that `` Chicken Little '' epresents the sane vision and that Homo Sapiens ' motto , `` Let 's go shopping ! '' is the cry of the true lunatic ?
RAILLY: Oh , my God !
JOSE: Coma on , Cole , do n't be an asshole . Look , I got orders , man ! You know what I 'm sposed to do if you do n't go along ? I 'm sposed to shoot the lady ! You got that ? They said , `` If Cole do n't obey this time , Garcia , you got ta shoot his girlfriend ! ''
COLE: This part is n't about the virus , is it ?
JOSE: Hey , man
COLE: It 's about obeying , about doing what you 're told .
JOSE: They gave you a pardon , man . Whatdaya want ?
COLE: Who am I supposed to shoot ?
RAILLY: James ! Thank God ! I thought you 'd disappeared . Listen , I think I know who it is ! I saw him ! It 's Dr. Mason 's assistant . An apocalypse nut ! The next flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38 . If he 's there , it has to be him .
COLE: I love you , Kathryn . Remember that .
RAILLY: Maybe we can stop him . Maybe we can actually do something .
SECURITY OFFICER: Excuse me , sir . Would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag ?
DR. PETERS: Me ? Oh , yes , of course . My samples . I have the appropriate papers .
RAILLY: Oh , God , we do n't have time for this .
DR. PETERS: Biological samples . I have the paperwork right here .
SECURITY OFFICER: I 'm going to have to ask you to open this , sir .
DR. PETERS: Open it ? Of course .
SECURITY OFFICER: It 's empty !
DR. PETERS: Well , yes , to be sure , it looks empty ! But I assure you , it 's not .
RAILLY: Please listen to me this is very urgent !
TRAVELER: We 're all in a hurry , lady . What 's so special about you ?
DR. PETERS: You see ! Also invisible to the naked eye .
SECURITY OFFICER: That 's not necessary , sir . Here you go . Thanks for your cooperation . Have a good flight .
COLE: Get your hands off her !
RAILLY: THERE HE IS ! HE 'S CARRYING A DEADLY VIRUS ! STOP HIM !
FIRST DETECTIVE: Police Officers . Would you step ove here , please .
DR. PETERS: WATCH IT !
ASTROPHYSICIST: Jones is my name . I 'm in insurance .
ANNE: Solomon
SOLOMON: Come , Anne . Jump .
ANNE: I will not ruin my dress . Catch me !
SOLOMON: I will catch you , Anne .
BEAT: I will . Again , lightly stern
ANNE: You will .
SOLOMON: Mr. Parker .
PARKER: Mr. Northup . Mrs. Northup .
SOLOMON: We are in need of a fresh carry all for the Mrs 's travels .
PARKER: A year 's passed ? Off to Sandy Hill ?
ANNE: I am .
PARKER: Something to suit your style , but sturdy enough for the forty miles ound trip .
ANNE: It 's beautiful .
CAUTIOUSLY: At what price ?
ANNE: We will take it . Children , come see what your father has just purchased for me .
PARKER: If you would sign our condolence ook . My hope is to find a way to forward it to the Widow Harrison . Sad days for the nation .
SOLOMON: Yes , certainly . Poor Mrs. Harris and her children . I hope brighte times ahead .
PARKER: A moment , sir , and you will be assisted .
SOLOMON: If we could discuss the price
PARKER: Forgive me , Mrs. Northup . A customer waits . Welcome , sir . To Jasper , with good nature
SOLOMON: Shop well , but mind your wallet .
PARKER: Ignore the gentleman 's nonsense . Now , may I interest you in a new cravat ? Pure silk by way of the
FITZGERALD: Jasper !
TO PARKER: My regrets for the intrusion .
SOLOMON: No intrusion .
FITZGERALD: Good day , sir .
SOLOMON: `` Thus has passed away from earth our late President . '' Solomon starts from the top of the article .
MARGARET: Will you read it again ?
ANNE: Not just now , darling .
MARGARET: For food that stays our hunger , For rest that brings us ease , For homes where memories linger , We give our thanks for these .
ALL: Amen .
SOLOMON: Margaret , that was wonderful .
MARGARET: Thank you , Papa .
SOLOMON: Alonzo , do you have something to say ?
ALONZO: Yes , I helped Momma make this .
ANNE: Yes , and you were such a good help . Especially making the gravy .
MARGARET: Papa , I would very much like to learn how to play the violin . Could you teach me ?
ALONZO: Me too !
MARGARET: Yes , but I asked Papa first .
SOLOMON: Both of you , calm down . We will have our first lesson after this wonderful dinner . And on that note , let 's start eating .
COMICALLY FORLORN: Three weeks . Two days .
ANNE: It is the custom . I wonder what you 'll do without me ?
SOLOMON: I wo n't stay idle . SOLOMON 's eyes lower .
ANNE: Darling , it 's good money .
SOLOMON: If only I did n't have to share your cooking with other people . ANNE holds his gaze .
ANNE: You do n't . They kiss .
SOLOMON: Travel safely .
ANNE: Stay safely .
MR. MOON: Call the Devil 's name There he is now . Mr. Northup ! I have two gentlemen who should make you acquaintance . Messrs. Brown and Hamilton .
BROWN: Sir .
MR. MOON: Mr. Northup , these two gentlemen were inquiring about distinguished individuals , and I was just this very moment telling them that Solomon Northup is an expert player on the violin .
HAMILTON: He was indeed .
SOLOMON: Mr . Moon is being overly gracious .
BROWN: Taking into consideration his graciousness and your modesty , may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse , sir ?
SOLOMON: A circus ?
HAMILTON: That is our usual employee . The company currently in the city of Washington .
BROWN: Circus too constricting a word to describe the talented and merry and with which we travel . It is a spectacle unlike most have eve witnessed . Creatures from the darkest Africa as yet unseen by civilized man . Acrobats from the Orient able to contort themselves in the most confounding manners .
HAMILTON: And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown ; an internationally renowned practitioner in the art of prestidigitation .
BROWN: We are on our way thither to ejoin the company having left fo a short time to make a small profit from our own exhibitions .
HAMILTON: The reason for our inquiry with Mr . Moon
BROWN: Yes . We had just a devil of a time in procuring music for ou
SOLOMON: Thank you sir
BROWN: If we could persuade you to accompany us as far as New York We would give you one dollar fo each day 's service and three dollars for every night played at our performances . In addition we would provide sufficient pay fo the expenses of your return from New York here to Saratoga .
SOLOMON: You understand this is all very sudden .
HAMILTON: Consider it an opportunity to see
SOLOMON: It 's intriguing
HAMILTON: If there is any way in which you would give consideration to the offer
SOLOMON: The payment offered is enticement enough , as is my desire to visit the metropolis .
HAMILTON: We are delighted , sir . So delighted . Though we would add that our travel plans
BROWN: We would like to depart with haste .
SOLOMON: As luck would have it , my wife and children are traveling . I will write her of our plans .
BROWN: Excellent ! I would beg you collect yourself , then we may proceed .
HAMILTON: No letter to post ?
SOLOMON: No need . My return will coincide with my family 's .
BROWN: We 're off then .
HAMILTON: Not an additional tip from a one of them . They expect to be entertained for nothing .
BROWN: And not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for .
SOLOMON: It 's the national mood . There 's too much grief to make room fo frivolity .
HAMILTON: My sincerest apologies , Solomon . You were promised opportunity , and you were given none .
BROWN: The opportunity is with the circus . A two man show poorly promoted , what were we to expect ? But the circus bills itself .
HAMILTON: True .
BROWN: I have told you of the circus with which we are connected . Creatures from the darkest of Africa . Acrobats from the Orient who
SOLOMON: You have described it , yes .
BROWN: Yes . We need to return immediately to Washington . SolomonI believe us familia enough now , but forgive me if I am oldwould you consider making the trip with us ? Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea .
HAMILTON: Entertaining at pubs and inns has it 's place , but a man of you skills deserves better .
BROWN: Hear , hear .
HAMILTON: And more importantly you would uild your own name and following . The circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations . An introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of eward . Now would be the time . With your family away , an opportunity presents itself .
BROWN: Said as fellow artists as well as usinessmen . Well worth the effort at least .
SOLOMON: You present a flattering epresentation . As my family will e traveling back shortly , perhaps I might commit only to one trial engagement .
HAMILTON: Oh , very good , sir . Very good . I can not recall being so excited .
BROWN: There is a practical concern . If you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers .
SOLOMON: Not necessary .
BROWN: Here in New York , no . But we will e entering slave states and as a matter of precaution It 's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well eing .
HAMILTON: Six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later .
BROWN: We 'll go to the Customs House in the morning , then travel on . Good usiness all around .
SOLOMON: Thatit 's far more than my wages amount to .
BROWN: Consider the remainder an advance from the circus . I can not tell youI honestly wish you had seen the expression of our directo when I described your abilities . He was fairly overcome with excitement .
HAMILTON: You should have invited him to sup with us .
BROWN: I did . I did , but so many preparations before the company is to depart .
BROWN: Tomorrow we shall prepare for ou Washington debut . But tonight , ou thoughts are with the great man
HAMILTON: Cheers .
BROWN: Another . Our departed President deserves all the salutation we can imbibe .
HAMILTON: That 's all right Solomon . No shame in it . No shame at all .
SOLOMON: .Soso sorry
HAMILTON: Shhh . We wo n't hear it . We wo n't .
BROWN: Let him sleep .
HAMILTON: Hmm . A good night 's sleep . And tomorrowtomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as though the earth were new again .
BROWN: Hamilton ! Nothing more we can do for him .
HAMILTON: Such is the pity .
BURCH: Well , my boy , how yah feel now ?
SOLOMON: I am Solomon Northup . I am a free man ; a resident of Saratoga , New York . The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free . I have papers . You have no ight whatsoever to detain me
BURCH: Yah not any
SOLOMON: And I promise you - I promise - upon my liberation I will have satisfaction for this wrong .
BURCH: Resolve this . Produce you papers .
SOLOMON: II insist
BURCH: Yah a slave . Yah a Georgia slave !
SOLOMON: No
RADBURN: I seen a good many of the black kind just where yah 're . Sick . Make me sick . Often times the situation was resolved , and I think ; what was all the beatin ' and abuse for ? Things end as they should , and the violence was fo naught . So why cause trouble when they ai n't no cause for it ? Be of a cooperative nature , and things do n't need be particularly unpleasant .
BEAT: Or , yah can carry on like yah een , and I fear yah wo n't live to see Sunday next .
SOLOMON: Help me ! Someone help me !
RADBURN: Go on . Warsh up .
RANDALL: Do you know when my Mama will come ?
RADBURN: Hush him up !
RANDALL: Mama .. ! Mama ! Is she going to come ?
SOLOMON: Quiet , please . Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable .
RANDALL: Mama !
SOLOMON: Your mother will come , I swear she will , but you must be silent . Please . Be silent !
RADBURN: That old thing of yours is just ags and tatters . Need something proper to wear . Solomon does n't move for the clothing .
SOLOMON: Thank you
RADBURN: Yah keep bein ' proper , yah 'll see how things work out . Radburn starts to take the old shirt .
SOLOMON: No ! It was from my wife .
RADBURN: Rags and tatters . Rags and tatters .
SOLOMON: This ca n't stand . It is a crime . I believe now someone lay in wait for me . My drink was altered We are free men . They havethey have no right to hold us .
CLEMENS: Who in your estimation is that sympathetic ear ?
SOLOMON: The two men I journeyed with . I 'm certain they 're making inquires at this very moment .
CLEMENS: I would be just as certain they are counting the money paid fo delivering you to this place .
SOLOMON: They were not kidnappers . They were artists . Fellow performers .
CLEMENS: You know that ? You know fo certain who they were ?
JOHN: No .
CLEMENS: I do n't say that to give you empty agitation , John
JOHN: For y'all . For y'all they ai n't nothin ' but that ! But John was ' n kidnapped . John bein ' hold as debt , tha 's all . Massa pay his debt , and John be redeemed
CLEMENS: Boy , our masters will not come fo us . John is nearly beside himself with panic .
JOHN: Now John'sJohn 's sorry fo y'all , but tha 's how it be . Where y'all goin ' , yah goin ' witout John . Massa take care of me . Massa take care .
RANDALL: Mama !
ELIZA: My darling . My sweet , sweet baby .
BURCH: Come on . Get yer blankets . Get up . Sensing that things will not end well
ELIZA: No , please do n't
BURCH: I do n't want to hear yer talk . Get in the yard .
ELIZA: Please
RADBURN: Ai n't no need for all that . Putting hand to Randall 's head .
JOHN: John 's massa gunna pay his debt . John 's massa gunna come for him .
BURCH: Not a word out of none a yah . Not a word .
MULATTO WOMAN: Cheer up and do n't be so cast down .
CLEMENS RAY: If you want to survive , do and say as little as possible . Tell no one who you really are and tell no one that you can read and write .
SLOWLY: Unless you want to be a dead nigger . Solomon 's face is one of a confused despair .
ROBERT: I say we fight . Robert delivers this in a hushed voice .
SOLOMON: The crew is fairly small . If it were well planned , I believe they could be strong armed .
CLEMENS RAY: Three ca n't stand against a whole crew . The rest here are niggers , orn and bred slaves . Niggers ai n't got the stomach for a fight , not a damn one .
ROBERT: All I know , we get where we travelling we 'll wish we 'd died trying .
CLEMENS RAY: Survival is not about certain death , it is about keeping you head down .
SOLOMON: Days ago I was with my family , in my home . Now you tell me all is lost . `` Tell no one who I really am '' if I want to survive . I do n't want to survive , I want to live .
CLEMENS RAY: Better off . Better than us .
RAY: Clemens ! Clemens Ray !
CLEMENS: My master Master Ray , sir ! Master Ray !
RAY: Who is in charge of this vessel ?
CAPTAIN: I am the Captain .
RAY: I am Mr. Jonus Ray . My solicito has documentation verifying that the Negro named Clemens Ray is my property . As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis
CAPTAIN: I know nothing of
RAY: You are ordered by court to return that property immediately , or face charges of thievery .
CAPTAIN: My duty is to transport goods . I am not responsible for thei origin .
RAY: Remove these contraptions ! To his mate
CAPTAIN: Free him !
RAY: It 's all well , now , Clemens . You will return home with me . Consider this notice and warning .
FREEMAN: Oren . John . Lethe . Eliza . Randall . Emily . Platt Platt !
CAPTAIN: Burch .
FREEMAN: Stand up . Solomon does as told .
SOLOMON: My name is not Platt . My name is Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face .
FREEMAN: Your name is Platt , and I will teach you your name so that you do n't forget . Shackle my niggers . Get them to my cart .
FREEMAN: Tallest to smallest , understand ? Are you taller than her ? Then you 'd go before her . Do it . Move . Keep your heads up . A sense of direction ; that 's how you look smart . None of those saucer eyes . Rid yourself of that smile . Look like a goddamn grinnin ' monkey . Put the least thought in you head . C'mon , now . Think of somethin ' .
SOLOMON: Can you play a reel ?
DISMISSIVE: Nah . I do n't know no reel .
SOLOMON: If I may ? Cape looks to Freeman
FREEMAN: He sick of your caterwaulin ' . Let him play , boy . Let 's see what he can do .
FORD: What is the price for the ones Platt and Eliza ?
FREEMAN: A thousand for Platt ; he is a nigger of talent . Seven hundred for Eliza . My fairest price .
FORD: You will accept a note ?
FREEMAN: As always , from you , Mr. Ford .
ELIZA: Please , sir Please do n't divide my family . Do n't take me unless you take my children as well .
FREEMAN: Eliza , quiet !
ELIZA: You will have the most faithful slave in me , sir . The most faithful slave that has eve lived , but I beg that you do not separate us .
BUYER: Your price for the child ?
FREEMAN: You see how fit the boy is . Like ipe fruit . He will grow into a fine beast .
BUYER: Done .
FORD: How much for the little girl ? You have no need for her . One so young will bring you no profit .
FREEMAN: I will not sell the girl . There 's heaps ' n piles of money to be made off her . She is a beauty . One of the regular bloods . None of you thick-lipped , bullet headed , cotton picking niggers .
FORD: Her child , man . For God 's sake , are you not sentimental in the least ?
FREEMAN: My sentimentality stretches the length of a coin . Do you want the lot , Mr. Ford , or do you pass on them all ?
FORD: I will take the ones Platt and Eliza . Eliza grips her children tight .
ELIZA: I will not go without my children . You will not take them from me .
FREEMAN: Take her out of here .
EMILY: Mama Mama !
TO SOLOMON: Play something ! Get the fiddle and play .
EMILY: Do n't cry , Mama . I will be a good girl . Do n't cry . I will keep my head up and I will look smart . I will always look smart .
FREEMAN: Make merry , all of you ! Goddamn it , Cape ! Keep her quiet or it 's your damned hide I will take it out of !
CHAPIN: Sam , call to the Mistress .
SAM: Mistress ! Mistress , they arrivn ' .
MRS. FORD: Did you bring all those niggers ? Two of them ? You got two ?
FORD: Make me something to eat , dear . The day has taken it from me .
MRS. FORD: Let me get a look at them
FORD: Mr. Chapin
FORD: Separated from her children .
MRS. FORD: Oh , dear .
FORD: It could n't be helped .
MRS. FORD: Poor , poor woman .
FORD: Mr. Chapin , tomorrow you will take these two up to the mill and start them workin ' . For now make them
CHAPIN: Yes , sir . C'mon , now . C'mon . Do n't dawdle .
TIBEATS: My name is John Tibeats , William Ford 's chief carpenter . You will efer to me as Master . Tibeats nods in Chapin 's direction
FORD: `` But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine . Then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying , Master , which is the great commandment in the law ? Jesus said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind . This is the first and great commandment . And the second is like unto it , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets . ''
SOLOMON: But he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve . For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? Is not he that sitteth at meat ? But I am among you as he that serveth .
WINSLOW: From where did you thieve this ?
SAM: Suh , the book is my property .
WINSLOW: Take your hands from me ! Ford comes running over .
FORD: What is the commotion ?
WINSLOW: Your niggers are either brazen o ebellious . This one was readin ' Scripture , and this one claims it to be his .
FORD: It is . A gift from his Mistress .
WINSLOW: You condone this ?
FORD: I encourage it . As a Christian I can do no less .
WINSLOW: You can do no worse , Ford . A slave that reads is dangerous . Winslow moves off . He yells back at Ford
FORD: Pay him no mind . The word of God applies to all . In that you may take comfort .
SOLOMON: The creek is plenty deep enough to sail , even with a boat full of load . The distance from the WORK AREA to the point on the latte ayou is several miles by wate fewer than land . It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially
TIBEATS: `` Materially diminished ? ''
SOLOMON: If we use the waterway .
TIBEATS: It 's a scheme . Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly . The passes are too tight .
SOLOMON: I reckon them at more than twelve feet at their most narrow . Wide enough for a tub to traverse . A team of niggers can clear it out .
TIBEATS: And you know what of transport and terra formin ' ?
SOLOMON: I labored repairing the Champlain canal , on the section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent . With my earnings I hired several efficient hands to assist me , and I entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy .
TO TIBEATS: I 'll admit to being impressed even if you wo n't .
TO SOLOMON: Collect a gang , see what good you can do .
SOLOMON: My great thanks , Master Ford .
FORD: My thanks to you , and it is the least of it . My hope is that it ings us both much joy over the years .
SOLOMON: Eliza . Eliza , stop !
ELIZA: It 's all I have to keeps my loss present .
SOLOMON: You let yourself be overcome by sorrow . You will drown in it .
ELIZA: Have you stopped crying for you children ? You make no sounds , but will you ever let them go in you heart ?
SOLOMON: They are as my flesh
ELIZA: Then who is distressed ? Do I upset the Mistress and the Master ? Do you care less for my loss than their well being ?
SOLOMON: Master Ford is a decent man .
ELIZA: He is a slaver .
SOLOMON: Under the circumstances
ELIZA: Under the circumstances he is a slaver ! Christian only in his proclamations . Separated me from my precious babies for lack of a few dollars . But you truckle at
SOLOMON: No
ELIZA: You luxuriate in his favor .
SOLOMON: I survive . I will not fall into despair . Woeful and crushed ; melancholy is the yolk I see most . I will offer up my talents to Master Ford . I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune .
ELIZA: Ford is your opportunity . Do you think he does not know that you are more than you suggest ? But he does nothing for you . Nothing . You are no better than prized livestock . Call for him . Call , tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns youSolomon .
DEFENSIVE: My back is thick with scars from
ELIZA: I accuse you of nothing . I can not accuse . I too have done so many , many dishonorable things to survive . And for all of them I have ended up here No bette than if I had stood up for myself . Father , Lord and Savior forgive me Forgive me . Oh , Solomon , let me weep for my children .
FORD: And Jesus called a little child unto him , and set him in the midst of them , And said , Verily I say unto you , Except ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
MRS. FORD: I can not have that kind of depression about .
FORD: But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea . Woe unto
TIBEATS: Raise yer shirt .
FORD: He 's a good carpenter and quick- witted .
TIBEATS: I am familiar with his cleverness .
FORD: You wo n't find a nigger more humble .
TIBEATS: Ai n't found a nigger yet I cai n't humble .
SOLOMON: Sir , have I done something wrong ?
FORD: Not your concern , Platt . I say with muchshame I have compiled debts . I have long preached austerity , but find myself hypocritical in that regard . You 'll be in the ownership of Mr. Tibeats . You are his now . Serve him as you 'd serve me .
SOLOMON: Sir .
FORD: And your faithfulness will not be forgotten .
SOLOMON: Yes , sir .
FORD: Pride and want have been my sin . Loss of you is but one of my punishments .
TIBEATS: Make them boards flush .
SOLOMON: They are , sir .
TIBEATS: They is no such thing . Solomon runs his hands over the boards .
SOLOMON: As smooth to the touch as a yearling 's coat .
TIBEATS: Callin ' me a liar , boy ?
SOLOMON: Only a matter of perspective , sir . From where you stand you may see differently . But the hands are not mistaken . I ask only that you employ all your senses before endering judgement .
TIBEATS: You are a brute . You are a dog , and no better for followin ' instruction .
SOLOMON: I 'll do as ordered , sir .
TIBEATS: Then you 'll be up at daybreak . You will procure a keg of nails from Chapin and commence puttin ' on clapboards .
CHAPIN: If Tibeats prefers a different size , I will endeavor to furnish them , but you may use those until further directed .
SOLOMON: Yes , sir .
TIBEATS: I thought I told yah ta commence ta puttin ' on clapboards this morn ' .
SOLOMON: Yes , master . I am about it . I have begun on the other side of the house .
TIBEATS: Did n't I tell yah last night to get a keg of nails of Chapin ?
SOLOMON: And so I did ; and Chapin said he would get another size for you , if you wanted them when he came back from the field .
TIBEATS: Goddamn yah ! I thought yah knowed somethin ' !
SOLOMON: I did as instructed . If there 's something wrong , then its wrong with your instructions .
TIBEATS: Yah black bastard ! Yah goddman lack bastard !
SOLOMON: I will not .
TIBEATS: Yew will not live ta see anothe day , nigger ! This is yer last , I swear it !
CHAPIN: What is the matter ?
SOLOMON: Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me .
CHAPIN: What 's the matter with the nails ?
TIBEATS: They'rethey 're too large .
CHAPIN: I am overseer here . I told Platt to use them , and
TIBEATS: This ai n't done by half . I will have flesh , and I will have all of it .
CHAPIN: Do not stir . Do not attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever . But if you run there is no protecting you .
CHAPIN: If you run , Platt , there is no protecting you . Rachel !
TIBEATS: Tha 's the one . Tha 's him .
CHAPIN: Gentlemen Whoever moves that nigger another foot from where he stands is a dead man . I am overseer of this plantation seven years , and in the absence of William Ford , my duty is to protect his interests . Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of fou hundred dollars . If you hang him , he loses his debt . Until that is canceled you have no claim to his life . Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook
TIBEATS: Yah got no cause . Platt is mine , and mine ta do with as I please . Yah touch my property , I will 'ave yah strung up as well .
CHAPIN: Sam ! Get the mule . You must ride to Master Ford . Tell him to come here at once without a single moment 's delay . Tell him they are trying to murder Platt . Hurry , oy . Bring him back if you must kill the mule to do so !
SAM: Yes , suh !
FORD: Platt My poor Platt .
FORD: I believe Tibeats is skulkin ' about the premises somewhere . He wants you dead , and he will attempt to have you so . It 's no longer safe for you here . And I do n't believe you will remain passive if Tibeats attacks . I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps . He will take charge of you .
SOLOMON: Master Ford , you must know ; I am not a slave .
FORD: I can not hear that .
SOLOMON: Before I came to you I was a freeman .
FORD: I am trying to save your life ! AndI have a debt to be mindful of . That , now , is to Edwin Epps . He is a hard man . Prides himself on being a `` nigger breaker . '' But truthfully I could find no others who would have you . You 've made a eputation of yourself . Whateve your circumstances , you are an exceptional nigger , Platt . I fea no good will come of it .
EPPS: `` And that servant which knew his Lord 's willWHICH KNEW HIS LORD 'S WILL and prepared not himselfPREPARED NOT HIMSELF , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes '' D 'ye hear that ? `` Stripes . '' That nigger that do n't take care , that do n't obey his lord - that 's his master - d 'ye see ? - that 'ere nigger shall be eaten with many stripes . Now , `` many '' signifies a great many . Forty , a hundred , a hundred and fifty lashes That 's Scripter !

TREACH: Five hundred twelve pounds fo Patsey .
EPPS: Five hundred twelve . Yah men folk got no shame lettin ' Patsey out pick yah ? The day ai n't yet come she swung lower than five hundred pounds . Queen of the fields , she is .
TREACH: Two hundred six pou
EPPS: I ai n't done , Treach . Ai n't I owed a minute to luxuriate on the work Patsey done ?
TREACH: Sir
EPPS: Damned Queen . Born and bred to the field . A nigger among niggers , and God give 'er to me . A lesson in the rewards of ighteous livin ' . All be observant ta that . All !
BEAT: Now , Treach . Now speak .

EPPS: Hit one forty five yesterday . Pull her out .
TREACH: Two hundred six pounds for Wiley .
EPPS: How much he pick yesterday ?
TREACH: Two hundred twenty nine pounds .
UNCLE ABRAM: Hold my words General Jackson will forever be immortalized . His avery will be handed down to the last posterity . If ever there be a stain upon `` raw militia , '' he done wiped away on the eight of January . I say da result a that day 's battle is of 'mo importance to our grand nation than any occurrence 'fo or since . Great man . Great man in deed . We all need pray to Heavenly Father da General reign over us always .
EPPS: Get up ! Get up , we dance tonight ! We will not waste the evenin ' with yer laziness . Get up .

EPPS: You 're talkin ' foolish . Sell little Pats ? She pick with more vigor than any other nigger ! Choose another ta go .
MISTRESS EPPS: No other . Sell her !
EPPS: I will not !
MISTRESS EPPS: You will remove that black bitch from this property , 'er I 'll take myself back to Cheneyville .
EPPS: Back to that hog 's trough where I found you ? Oh , the idleness of that yarn washes over me . Do not set yourself up against Patsey , my dear . That 's a wager on which you will not profit . Calm yerself . And settle for my affection , 'cause my affection you got . Or , go . 'Cause I will rid myself of yah well before I do away with her !
MISTRESS EPPS: Platt
SOLOMON: Yes , Mistress .
MISTRESS EPPS: Can you find your way to Bartholomew 's ?
SOLOMON: I can , ma'am . Handing Solomon a sheet of paper .
MISTRESS EPPS: This is a list of goods and sundries . You will take it to be filled and return immediately . Tell Bartholomew to add it to ou debt .
SOLOMON: I will , Mistress .
MISTRESS EPPS: Where yah from , Platt ?
SOLOMON: I have told you .
MISTRESS EPPS: Tell me again .
SOLOMON: Washington .
MISTRESS EPPS: Who were yah Master ?
SOLOMON: Master name of Freeman .
MISTRESS EPPS: Was he a learned man ?
SOLOMON: I suppose so .
MISTRESS EPPS: He learn yah ta read ?
SOLOMON: A word here or there , but I have no understanding of the written text .
MISTRESS EPPS: Do n't trouble yer self with it . Same as the rest , Master bought yah to work . Tha 's all . And any more 'll earn yah a hun'red lashes .
AGGRESSIVELY: Boy , where are you going ?
SOLOMON: ( almost tripping ove
HIS WORDS: To the store , Sir , to Bartholomew 's . I was sent there y Mistress Epps .
PATROLLER: Get there and get there quick .
MISTRESS EPPS: Any trouble ?
SOLOMON: No , ma'am . No trouble .
MASTER SHAW: Platt Epps , good Sunday morning .
SOLOMON: Good morning , Master Shaw . I 've een sent by Master to retrieve Patsey . May I approach ?
MASTER SHAW: You may . Solomon makes his way over to the piazza .
SOLOMON: Excuse me , Mistress Shaw .
MISTRESS SHAW: Nigger Platt .
SOLOMON: My apologies . Patsey , Maste wishes you to return .
PATSEY: Sabbath day . I 's free ta roam .
SOLOMON: Understood . But the Master sent me running to fetch you , and said no time should be wasted .
MISTRESS SHAW: Drink tea ?
SOLOMON: Thank you , Mistress , but I do n't dare .
MISTRESS SHAW: Would you knowed Massa Epps 's consternation ta be any lessened wit your timely return ? Sit . Sit and drink the tea that offered .
SOLOMON: I 'd rather not say
MISTRESS SHAW: L'il gossip on the Sabbath be fine . All things in moderation .
SOLOMON: As you are aware , Master Epps can e a man of a hard countenance . There are times when it is impossible to account for his logic . You know he has ill feelings toward your husband .
MISTRESS SHAW: He do .
SOLOMON: Master Epps has somehow come to elieve , as incorrectly as it may e , that Master Shaw is That he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man . A misguided elief born out of their mutual competition as planters , no doubt .
MISTRESS SHAW: No doubtif not born outta truth itself .
SOLOMON: I 'm certain Patsey 's well being is Master Epps 's only concern .
MISTRESS SHAW: Nothin ' Epps desire come outta concern .
SOLOMON: I meant no disrespect .
MISTRESS SHAW: He ai n't heard you .
SOLOMON: I meant no disrespect to you , Mistress .
MISTRESS SHAW: Ha ! You worry for me ? Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities . I ai n't felt the end of a lash in 'mo years than I cain recall . Ai n't worked a field , neither . Where one time I served , now I got others servin ' me . The cost to my current existence be Massa Shaw oadcasting his affections , ' n me enjoyin ' his pantomime of fidelity . If that what keep me from the cotton pickin ' niggers , that what it be . A small and easonable price to be paid 'fo sure .
EPPS: Pats ! Patsey !
SOLOMON: Do not look in his direction . Continue on .
EPPS: Patsey !
SOLOMON: Found her , Master , and brought he ack just as instructed .
EPPS: What 'd you jus now tell her ? What 'd you say to Pats ?
SOLOMON: No words were spoken . None of consequence .
EPPS: Lie ! Damned liar ! Saw you talkin ' with 'er . Tell me !
SOLOMON: I can not speak of what did not occur . Epps grabs Solomon .
EPPS: I 'll cut your black throat .
MISTRESS EPPS: What ? Wha 's the fuss ?
SOLOMON: A misunderstanding is all . It egan when I was sent to retrieve Patsey from where she 'd taken sabbatical at Master Shaw 's . Upon eturning , Master Epps believed Patsey and me to be in conversation when we were not . I tried to explain , but it lead to all this .
MISTRESS EPPS: What is it ? Ya cai n't remain the Sabbath without her under you eye ? Ya are a no-account bastard .
EPPS: Hold a moment
MISTRESS EPPS: A filthy , godless heathen . My bed is too holy for yah ta share .
EPPS: Wha'swha 's he been tellin ' yah ?
MISTRESS EPPS: Of yer misbegotten ways .
EPPS: And he would know what of anythin ' ? I ai n't even spoken with him today . Platt , yah lyin ' nigger , have I ? Have I ?
TREACH: Get him water .

EPPS: Seen nothin ' but her turn away .
MISTRESS EPPS: Are you blind or ignorant ? It was hot , hateful scorn . It filled that black face . Yah tell me yah did ' n see it , then yah choose not to look , or yah sayin ' I lie .
EPPS: Whatever it was , it passed .
MISTRESS EPPS: Is that how yah are with the niggers ? Let every ill thought fester inside 'em . Look at 'em .
PATSEY: Platt Platt , you awake ?
SOLOMON: I am .
PATSEY: I have a request ; an act of kindness .
SOLOMON: Return it !
PATSEY: It yours , Platt .
SOLOMON: For what cause ?
PATSEY: All I ask end my life . Take my ody to the margin of the swamp
SOLOMON: No .
PATSEY: Take me by the throat . Hold me low in the water until I 's still ' n without life . Bury me in a lonely place of dyin ' .
SOLOMON: No ! I will do no such thing . Thethe gory detail with which
PATSEY: I thought on it long and hard .
SOLOMON: It is melancholia , nothing more . How does such despair even come to you ?
PATSEY: How can you not know ? I got no comfort in this life . If I cai n't uy mercy from yah , I 'll beg it .
SOLOMON: There are others . Beg them .
PATSEY: I 'm begging you !
SOLOMON: Why ? Why would you consign me to damnation with such an un-Godly equest ?
PATSEY: There is God here ! God is merciful , and He forgive merciful acts . Wo n't be no hell for you . Do it . Do what I ai n't got the strength ta do myself .
EPPS: It is a plague .
EPPS' SLAVE: I hear cutting cane is twice as hard as picking cotton .
BOB: But at least we 'll be away from Master Epps .
UNCLE ABRAM: Boy , you two have no sense .
EPPS: Yer Judge Turner 's for the season . More if need be , until my crop eturn . Yah 'll bring no disrespect to me , and yah 'll bring no biblical plagues to him . Be decent , ere mark my words , I will deliver an ungodly whippin ' .
OVERSEER: Draw the cane from the rick , cut the top and flags from the stalk , understand ? Leave only that part which is sound and healthy . Cast off the rest
ZACHARY: Off the porch . Get off . Like a dog shooed away , Solomon steps down .
SOLOMON: Sir
JUDGE TURNER: Platt is it ? Have you cultivated cane previously ?
SOLOMON: No , sir , I have not .
JUDGE TURNER: You take to it quite naturally . Are you educated ?
SOLOMON: Niggers are hired to work , not to ead and write .
JUDGE TURNER: You play the fiddle ?
SOLOMON: I do .
JUDGE TURNER: Willard Yarney , a planter up the ayou , celebrates his anniversary in a three week 's time . I will hold out your name to him . What you earn is yours to keep .
SOLOMON: Sir .
JUDGE TURNER: Mind yourself , Platt .
SOLOMON: C'mere . C'mon , boy .
UNCLE ABRAM: Runaways I would expect . The Bayou full with 'em . They nothin ' 'mo dangerous than a nigger in flight .
SOLOMON: They acted out of desperation .
UNCLE ABRAM: Act outta lunacy . Heads fulla stories 'bout life up north . Yah ever been north , Platt ?
SOLOMON: No
UNCLE ABRAM: And never should yah be . I hope that yah never bear witness the sorry condition of the northern lack . Got neither no purpose , nor direction . They justhey jus fall about the streets in search of sustenance of both body and spirit .
SOLOMON: You know this to be so ?
UNCLE ABRAM: Two of my massas tolt me .
CELESTE: I am hungry . Give me food .
SOLOMON: Who are you ?
CELESTE: I 'm hungry .
SOLOMON: What is your name ?
CELESTE: My name is Celeste .
SOLOMON: What are your circumstances ?
CELESTE: I belong ta Massa Carey , and 'ave een two days among da palmettoes . Celeste is sick and cai n't work , and would rather die in the swamp
SOLOMON: Yes .

SOLOMON: I was . I am .
CELESTE: Free heart means nothin if ' n yo ody gunna die a slave .
SOLOMON: I will not .
CELESTE: How ? Celeste knows you ai n't gunna run . Celeste knows it ai n't your nature .
SOLOMON: I have a plan . I have a letter .
CELESTE: A letter ? How 'll yah mail da letter ? Who yah trust to post it ? A nigger that can read and write is a nigger that 'll hang .
SOLOMON: I risk discovery to take more .
CELESTE: You will bring Celeste 'mo food .
SOLOMON: I have my letter .
CELESTE: Yah has your freedom then ?
SOLOMON: All that remains is to contrive measures by which the letter can safely be deposited in the post office . When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy .
CELESTE: I have resolved to return to my Massa .
SOLOMON: Is it more food you need ?
CELESTE: I live in fear .
SOLOMON: None will come after you in the swamps .
CELESTE: It ai n't the patrollers I scared of At all seasons the howling of wild animals can be heard at night along the border of the swamps . At first their calls were welcomin ' . Dey too was free , ' n I thought dey greeted me like a sistah . Lately , dey cries have turned horrifyin ' . They mean to kill Celeste .
SOLOMON: The solitude plays tricks . It 's your impression , nothing more . If you go back to your master you could face the same .
CELESTE: My freedom been nothin ' but a daydream . So was Celeste 's thoughts of slaves conjoinin ' in the bayou .
SOLOMON: Better the loneliness . You have een free most of the summer . Return now and your master will make example of you .
CELESTE: It is lonely dwellin ' waiting fo others who wo n't never come .
SOLOMON: Go north . Make your way by night
CELESTE: It 'll only be worse if ' n Celeste do n't go back of her own will .
SOLOMON: You wo n't be caught . The dogs wo n't track you . You areyou are unique . Celeste
CELESTE: You got alternatives , Solomon .
SOLOMON: To return is to die !
CELESTE: Celeste got no one to write a letter to .

ARMSBY: It 's a tragedy . How does such come to pass ? Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand . I 'm of a damn sight bette station . And my desires neve lacked for a grandiose component , though I will admit they have at times been short on ingenuity . But only at times . I 've worked as an overseer , you know .
SOLOMON: I did not , sir .
ARMSBY: Not `` sir . '' Just Armsby . Not owed more than any other in the field . I worked plantations from Virginia , down into Alabama . I could manage easy a hundred slaves and have done so . But to toil in the field ? Never thought that would come to pass . Never . But times are desperate . Where once I had said `` no '' to Epps and his merger offerings , I returned cap
SOLOMON: How did you arrive at such a place , if I may ask ?
ARMSBY: Ask . It 's just conversation . From a pocket Armsby produces a flask .
SOLOMON: Where is your place of birth ?
ARMSBY: Maryland . Have you traveled there ?
SOLOMON: I can not say that I have .
ARMSBY: Fine country . More seasonal than the bayou . A deal less humid .
SOLOMON: Why did you leave it ?
ARMSBY: To make my fortune , of course . I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity that were the lore of the southern states all that 's needed being a patch of land and a few good growing seasons . Cotton ,
BEAT: And get myself home . Armsby takes another drink and leans back .
TREACH: Get him water .
BOB: I just want to say something about Uncle Abram . He was a good man and he always looked out for us since we were little . God Bless him . God love him . And God keep him .
SOLOMON: The proceeds of my fiddling performances . A few picayunes , ut all I have in the world . I promise them to you if you will do me the favor I require . But I beg you not to expose me if you can not grant the request .
ARMSBY: What do you ask ?
SOLOMON: First , your word , sir .
ARMSBY: On my honor .
SOLOMON: It is a simple enough request . I ask only that you deposit a lette in the Marksville post office . And that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever . The details of the letter are of no consequence . Even at that , there would be an imposition of much pain and suffering were it known I was the author . A patron is what I require , sir .
ARMSBY: Where 's the letter now ?
SOLOMON: It is not yet written . I will have it in a day . Two at most , my skill with composition as poor as it is . Armsby considers the request .
ARMSBY: I will do it . And will accept whatever payment is offered .
SOLOMON: In two days . Thank you . Solomon exits .
EPPS: Get up .
EPPS: Well , boy . I understand I 've got a larned nigger that writes
SOLOMON: All I have to say , master , is all that need be said . There is no truth in it .
EPPS: You say .
SOLOMON: How could I write a letter without ink or paper ? There is nobody I want to write to 'cause I hai n't got no friends living as I know of . That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow . You know this , just as you know that I am constant in truth . Now , master , I can see what that Armsby is after , plain enough . Did n't he want you to hire him for an overseer ? A beat .
EPPS: I 'm damned . I 'll be god Were he not free and white , Platt . Were he not free and white .
EPPS: Take it . You look unsettled .
BASS: I 'm well .
EPPS: No shame in taking respite from the heat ; drink , shade . It 's ungodly for travelers . Hearty , o otherwise .
BASS: Your humor is inadvertent .
EPPS: Then share what 's funny . Or what ills you .
BASS: I 'm here to complete the work at hand . As requested , and as paid .
EPPS: Something rubs you wrongly . Before I take further offense , I offer you the opportunity to speak on it .
BASS: You ask plainly , I will tell you plainly . What I find amusing You worry about my well being in the heat but , quite frankly , the condition of your laborers
EPPS: `` The condition of my '' What in the hell are you
BASS: It is horrid . It 's all wrong . All wrong , sir .
EPPS: They ai n't hired help . They 're my slaves .
BASS: You say that with pride .
EPPS: I say it as fact .
BASS: If the conversation concerns what is factual and what is not ; there 's no justice no ighteousness in slavery . I would n't own a slave if I was rich as Croesus , which I am not , as is perfectly well understood . More particularly among my creditors . There 's another humbug the credit system . Humbug , sir . No credit , no debt . Credit leads a man into temptation . Cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from
EPPS: What right ? I bought 'em . I paid for 'em .
BASS: Of course you did . The law says you have the right to hold a nigger , but begging the law 's pardonit lies . Is everything ight because the law allows it ? Suppose they 'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave ?
EPPS: Ha !
BASS: Suppose .
EPPS: That ai n't a supposable case .
BASS: Because the law states that you liberties are undeniable ? Because society deems it so ? Laws change . Social systems crumble . Universal truths are constant . It is a fact , it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and ight for all . White and black alike .
EPPS: Whoa , whoa , whoa . Yah compare me to a nigger , Bass ? Yah might as well ask what the difference is etween a white man and a baboon . Now , I seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger I got . Yah 'd call them fellers citizens , I s'pose ?
BASS: Look here ; you ca n't laugh me down in that way . These niggers are human beings . If they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals , you and men like you will have to answer for it . There 's an
EPPS: Ahhh !
BASS: A fearful ill , resting on this
EPPS: You betray yourself a foreigner !
BASS: That will not go unpunished forever . There will be a eckoning yet .
EPPS: You like to hear yourself talk , Bass , better than any man I know of . Yah 'd argue that black was white , or white black if anybody would contradict you . A fine supposition if yah lived among Yankees in New England . But yah do n't .
PHEBE: We know nothin ' of her , Massa .
EPPS: The hell you do n't ! You know where she is ! She run off , ai n't she ? She 's escaped , and you miserable black dogs stand like
EPPS: Run off . Run off , did you ?
EPPS: You miserable wench ! Where you een ?
PATSEY: I been nowhere .
EPPS: Lies to your misdeeds !
PATSEY: The Sabbath day , Massa . I took me a walk to commune wit da Lord .
EPPS: Bring the Lord into ye deceptions ? Yah Godless Shaw 's . Comin ' from Shaw 's plantation were n't yah ?
PATSEY: No
EPPS: Yah took yerself ta pleasure Shaw . Yah gave baser passion to that unblushin ' libertine ! Solomon tries to intervene
EPPS: Now yah speak ? Now that yah want to add to 'er lies yah find ye tongue .
PATSEY: Do not strike him . I went to Massa Shaw 's plantation !
EPPS: Yah admit it .
PATSEY: Freely . And you know why .
EPPS: You lie
PATSEY: The Lord knows that 's all .
EPPS: You lie !
PATSEY: And you blind wit yer own covetousness . I do n't lie , Massa . If you kill me , I 'll stick ta that .
EPPS: I 'll learn you to go to Shaw 's . Treach , go get some line .
MISTRESS EPPS: Do it ! Strike the life from her .
EPPS: Beat her .
PATSEY: I 'd rather it you , Platt .
EPPS: Strike her , or yah 'll get the same !
MISTRESS EPPS: He pantomimes . There ai n't barely a welt on her . That 's what you niggers make of yah ; a fool fe the takin ' .
EPPS: Yah will strike her . Yah will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal , o I will kill every nigger in my sight !
PATSEY: Do it , Platt . Do n't stop until I am dead .
EPPS: Until I say no more ! I ai n't said nothing !
SOLOMON: Thou devil ! Sooner or later , somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin !
EPPS: No sin ! There is no sin ! A man does how he pleases with his property . At the moment , Platt , I am of great pleasure . You be goddamn careful I do n't come to wantin ' to lightenin ' my mood no further .
SOLOMON: Master Bass , I want to ask you what part of the country you came from ?
BASS: No part of this land . I was born in Canada . Now guess where that is .
SOLOMON: Oh , I know where Canada is . I have been there myself .
BASS: Have you ?
SOLOMON: Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places . And I have been in York state , too . Buffalo and Rochester and Albany , and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal . Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare .
BASS: Well traveled for a slave . How came you here ?
SOLOMON: Master Bass , if justice had been done I never would have been here .
BASS: How 's this ? Tell me all about it .
SOLOMON: I am afraid to tell you , though I do n't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should .
BASS: Every word you speak is a profound secret .
BASS: How many years all told ?
SOLOMON: Just nearlyjust passed eleven .
BASS: Your story isit is amazing , and in no good way .
SOLOMON: Do you believe , sir , in justice as you have said ?
BASS: I do .
SOLOMON: That slavery is an evil that should befall none ?
BASS: I believe so .
SOLOMON: If you truly do , I would askI would beg that you write my friends in the north , acquainting them with my situation and eseeching them to forward free papers , or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my elease .
BASS: I have always forgone elationships and family . I did once have a sweetheart who I loved deeply .
BASS: And bring those markers !
SOLOMON: You are certain ?
BASS: I have inquired thoroughly . More than is safe for either of us .
SOLOMON: Five months . On top of these years . No cause remains .
BASS: If there is any chance
SOLOMON: Mr. Bass
BASS: I will continue to write you
SOLOMON: Go home knowing you have tried .
SHERIFF: Platt ? Where is the boy called Platt ?
SOLOMON: Sir The Sheriff crosses to him .
SHERIFF: Your name is Platt , is it ?
SOLOMON: Yes , sir . Pointing off to the distance .
SHERIFF: Do you know that man ?
SOLOMON: Mr. Parker ?
SHERIFF: Say again ?
SOLOMON: Mr. Parker ? As he does , Epps makes his way over .
SHERIFF: That man received a lette compiling many accusations . You look me in the eye and on you life answer me truthfully have you any other name than Platt ?
SOLOMON: Solomon Northup is my name .
EPPS: Sheriff
SHERIFF: Have you a family ?
EPPS: What 's all this ?
SHERIFF: It 's official business .
EPPS: My nigger , my business .
SHERIFF: Your business waits .
TO SOLOMON: Tell me of your family .
SOLOMON: I have a wife and two children .
SHERIFF: What were your children 's names ?
SOLOMON: Margaret and Alonzo .
SHERIFF: And your wife 's name before he marriage ?
SOLOMON: Anne Hampton . I am who I say .
EPPS: Nah You will unhand 'em . Platt is my nigger !
PARKER: He is Solomon Northup .
EPPS: You say
PARKER: He belongs to no man .
EPPS: You say ! You come here , unfamiliar to me , and make claims .
SHERIFF: Not claims . I have no doubts . This is Solomon Northup , a esident of Saratoga Springs , NY .
EPPS: To hell with that ! My nigger , and I 'll fight you for 'em !
PARKER: As is your right . As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts . Your decision .
EPPS: You think this is the last you 'll see of me , boy ? It ai n't .
TO PARKER: Whatever paper you hold about his freedom , it do n't mean naught . He is my nigger - and I will have my day in court , sir . As God as my witness , I will have my day in court . Take 'em ! Epps calls to Bob-
PATSEY: Platt
PARKER: Solomonif we know what 's wise , we should depart .
PARKER: Are you ready ? Solomon swallows and nods .
SOLOMON: I apologize for my appearance . I have had a difficult time of things these past many years .
MARGARET: He is my husband .
SOLOMON: Husband ?
MARGARET'S HUSBAND: It is very good to meet you , sir .
SOLOMON: We have much acquainting to do .
MARGARET: And this is your grandson . Solomon Northup Staunton .
SOLOMON: Solomon
ANNE: There is nothing to forgive .
ARON: Nearly missed it !
KRISTI: Sure , I 'm Kristi .
MEGAN: Megan .
ARON: Nice to meet you . What a day .
KRISTI: It 's beautiful .
ARON: Did you bike or come straight from the trail head ?
KRISTI: We left the car there . Pretty quiet .
ARON: I left mine at the Horseshoe Canyon and biked here .
MEGAN: You biked from Horseshoe ? That 's 20 miles or more .
ARON: 17 and windy . The girls exchange glances .
MEGAN: Yeah , you surprised us , sneaking up like that .
ARON: Sorry .
MEGAN: It 's kind of nervy seeing a lone guy walking up to you in the middle of the desert .
ARON: Yeah , I know , I mean there 's no one around for 50 miles .
KRISTI: and suddenly there 's a guy ight behind you and ` wait a minute , why is he wearing a HOCKEY
ARON: Let me guess You 're here fo the paintings or the Cathedral ?
KRISTI: The Cathedral ? We 've got a bit disorientated and the map is n't great . Where is it ?
ARON: The climb 's a little tricky but it 's worth it .
MEGAN: Are you ok ? ARON !
KRISTI: Of course he 's ok . Listen to him .
MEGAN: We 've got to go again . And film it !
KRISTI: So have you got a girlfriend , Aron ?
ARON: Well , there 's not really anyone special .
MEGAN: Ah , so there 's lots of girlfriends .
KRISTI: There 's always a girl , you just do n't know it yet .
MEGAN: Yeah , we meet lots of guys and there 's always a girl .
ARON: Long story .
KRISTI: With lots of characters in it .
MEGAN: Wow , highest person in Colorado .
ARON: Well I figure no one else is mad enough to climb in the winter .
KRISTI: you can be the highest person on the continent !
MEGAN: Did n't you see it ?
ARON: What ? No .
MEGAN: Yeah , it 's an old cattle guardian 's house - the roof 's caved in and someone spray-painted MOTEL 6 on the side . Smelled weird though .
ARON: Just like a MOTEL 6 then ?
KRISTI: Why are you on your own ?
ARON: Solitude . Great tunes . Empty mind . He indicates the wilderness .
MEGAN: Phish ?
KRISTI: Not those guys from
ARON: Yeah , I know , I know .
LAUGHS: See , that 's why I 'm on my own . Nobody likes me or my band .
ARON: I 'm not certified yet but that 's what I want to do .
MEGAN: An illegal instructor .
ARON: It 's hard to get the hours to qualify . Catch 22 .
KRISTI: Well , we 'll sign your time-card today .
ARON: Great . Now put your ass on my head .
KRISTI: Okay but do n't look and no grabbing now , if I do
MEGAN: Oh whatever , you love it .
KRISTI: Shhh !
ARON: You 'll have to chimney down a little ways - like here , watch - one foot on each wall then squat onto your right heel , now you utt 's on the wall , so you can move your right foot across , now put your left foot under your butt lower down and scootch your butt down - watch that black part , it 's slick , slime , try not to get it on your shoes - if you can get to these bomber handholds here it 's like an elevator shaft and just think friction to control the slide . This is a keeper so always have someone at the bottom to boost you out . He looks up to them .
MEGAN: I did n't understand any of that .
ARON: Why do n't you come with me to the Big Drop Rappel ? I can give you a lift back to your car .
KRISTI: How far is it ? He shows them on the map .
ARON: About another 8 miles or so , I think .
MEGAN: You 'll never get out before dark .
ARON: No , I really got to do this . Anyway I 've my miner 's lamp .
MEGAN: You do n't climb at night , do you ?
ARON: No , it 's great for seeing snakes in hand holds . Can I get a picture then ? They pose with raven feathers in their hair .
KRISTI: Yeah , we 'd like that . What time ?
MEGAN: Where ?
ARON: Drive on the east road and about 40 miles out there 's a huge inflatable Scooby Doo . You ca n't miss it . Turn off and it 's about 2 miles down that track . Starts late and it 'll go right thru .
KRISTI: Come on Aron , hike out with us - we 'll go get your truck , hang out and have a beer .
ARON: No , I really got to do this .
KRISTI: Okay . Scooby Doo , yeah ?
ARON: That 's the one . I 'll have 3 cold eers waiting for us .
MEGAN: 12 cold beers !
ARON: Easy Aron , easy now .
CD RECORDING: Good evening Las Vegas are you having a good time ? Are you ready for PHISH !
ARON: Wo n't be coming back this way .
ARON: FUCK , get your hand out of there !
ARON: FUCK ! What the fuck ? How the fuck did you get your hand trapped by a fucking boulder ? Its crushed , it 's fucking dying man !
MARK: Wow , look at the size of this one .
ARON: Cool .
RAVEN: Caw-caw .
ARON: Caw-caw .
RANA: OK - lights off and line up alongside me .
ARON: It 's three-oh-five on Sunday . This marks my twenty-four-hour mark of eing stuck in Blue John Canyon above the Big Drop . My name is Aron Ralston . My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of Englewood , Colorado . Whoever finds this , please make an attempt to get this to them . Be sure of it . I would appreciate it .
ARON: So the way I see it there 's kind of four things happening here I tried to move it with some igging useless and I tried chipping away at the rock I think part of the problem is , is that my hand is actually supporting the rock . Which means every time I chip away the rock moves a bit and settles onto my hand again . I ca n't feel it happening but microscopically , it seems to be , ecause the little gap over there etween the rock and the wall seems to be getting smaller . And this chockstone is the hardest thing here .
ARON: No one 's coming Aron .
ARON: Still not sure . I 'll see you Tuesday .
ARON: Always do .
GIRL: That was your Mom ! And your Dad called . Call him . We 're going . See you next week . Oh , and Rana called .
ARON: It 's Monday - all day - bummer . I spent the morning trying to create a 6 1 system ration and lift the oulder but friction between the ope and carabiners is dissipating every bit of force I apply .
ARON: There 's a raven flies overhead , I clocked it at 8.15 . I 'll bet it 's there tomorrow too . I 'll film it for you tomorrow
ARON: The blades are too blunt even to eak the skin . I guess that 's the chipping . It 's not even a prope Leatherman . It 's a knock-off one we got free in a gift pack with a torch Mom gave it to me .
ARON: I 've been thinking about what my friend Rob in Aspen says to me several frequently.. Several times that , confusingly , 'It 's not what you do but who you are ' . I kind of got hung up on that a lot , because I always thought who I was , was very much wrapped up with what I did . That I was happy ecause of the things that I did that made me happy . If things you do make you happy , then they can also make you unhappy . I think that 's why I found myself being as ambitious and energetic - The wind interrupts him and he shivers .
ARON: No . No . Do n't .
PAUSE: Still , I 'd get a drink . He shudders , it 's ridiculous .
ARON: Ready for lift-off .
ARON: Shit missed it . 8 31AM . He 's late and I still missed it .
VIOLENTLY WITH: Temperature 57 - shivers , like 56 - 55 chattering ,
RACKING HIS: A figure starts body with a a small fire to furious comfort Aron . vengeance . Perfect for bacon and beans . He pisses again 02.02= > 03.03= > 04.04 ARON Huge luminous figures on There 's the
BURRITO WASHED: Did that make sense ? down with a swig of urine , He switches off and applies winces and lip balm . swallows somehow . ARON He looks at it and bites a ` That 's it . it off . Masticates it on I 'm on the and on Chewing . urine diet now . Well , The chockstone it 's no waits and Aron 's slurpee ' foot kicks and then lands and they fall together .
ARON CHIPPING: away desultory A slit of light in blackness eveals Jon in work clothes . Aron licks A light switch flicks on and moisture thin metal shelves full of
TURNS ALWAYS: Rana 's face is remaining in huge on the inside the light.An of his head bag , smiling accelerating at him . Her face in huge carousel of scale compared to his head . yellow warmth .
ARON: God , it 's Aron again . I still need some help . It 's getting bad here . I 'm out of water and food . Listen . Give me the strength not to do anything against myself . I want to see this through , whatever .
VOICE: I did this Aron . I created this . The boulder did what it was here to do . It was waiting for me but it did the only natural thing it could do . I chose to come here , I chose to do this descent by myself . I chose not to tell anyone where I was going . I chose to turn away from the women who were there to keep me from getting in this trouble . I wanted it to be like this . Look how far I came to find this spot . It 's not that I 'm getting what I deserve - I 'm getting what I wanted .
ARON: I hate this rock . The rage blooms purple in his mind .
ARON: Ok Aron , here we go . You 're in it now .
ERIK: We are the Mejers from Holland . At the start of the trailhead we talked to a ranger who told us about a car that was parked in the area already for several days and that the owner might be missing in the canyon . We joked that we would keep our eyes open and that we would try to find him . After a hike of 5.3 kilometres to the Great Gallery where we took some pictures , we eturned and suddenly heard a noise ehind us , and after that a voice that cried `` Help , I need help '' . Monique and I immediately realized that this had to be the missing person .
ERIK: We are the Mejers from Holland . You should stop and rest .
ARON: No , we need to keep hiking . We need a helicopter - who can run fastest ? - You , go now fast . Take him . Monique runs ahead with Andy , her son .
ERIK: They told us you were here .
ARON: Who ? Who told you ?
ERIK: The police at the parking lot
ARON: Do you have a phone ?
ERIK: There 's no signal for miles .
ARON: Do you have a cell phone ?
WAYNE: No . I 'm Wayne . I have some medical training .
ARON: Is it ok for me to drink so much water ?
WAYNE: Sure so long as it does n't make you vomit . Aron drinks more and more , he overhears
TO ERIK: Make sure he does n't pass out .
ARON: I got ta stop and empty my shoes . You 'll have to tie my shoe lace .
PILOT: Are you Aron ?
ARON: Yes I am . Can I get a lift ?
PILOT: Just get in buddy . We 're all looking for you .
ARON: Thank you for bringing me back . The most senior of the burly men says ,
BURLY MAN: That 's all your miracle days used up kid . You need to rest . You can stand everyone a beer later .
ARON: Will you look after this for me please ?
MOM: My boy . My only one . There you are . She strokes his head so gently .
ARON: Hey Mom .
MOM: How are you feeling ?
ARON: OK. Are you okay
MOM: You 've been asleep for 2 days . We are so lucky
ARON: Mom , I 'm sorry I scared you .
RANA: OK - he 's got 3 vegetarian hotdogs and the tickets and he 'll be outside Gate 6 in 5 .
ARON: So are you guys ok with me ?
RANA: Yeah . We split up a while back when you were in hospital .
ARON: Christine told me .
RANA: Is that what this is about ?
ARON: Yeah . She laughs at him .
RANA: What about the climbing ?
ARON: I 'm gon na finish the 49ers this winter or next .
RANA: Well , all I ca n't figure out is what took you so long to cut it off and get one of these . They both laugh . But he also answers .
ARON: Rana , before I did it I was hallucinating , I saw this child , a little blond boy -
RANA: Not Jesus please
RANA: No Aron , it 's not .
RANA: You know , everyone who cares fo you , a little bit of them dies each time you go back .
SANCHEZ: Your Majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of Hispanola , our first settlement in the New World , and the activities there of your servant , Christophe Columbus , Admiral of the Ocean Sea , Governor of that Island . You will emember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos , degradation and madness eyond imagining . SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully .
BROTHER BUYL: Yes , Your Honor .
SANCHEZ: He promised gold . Not finding the easy quantities he promised , Columbus commanded each Indian to pay an annual tribute . Most being unable to , they were barbarously punished , against the express wish of Your Christian Majesties ISABEL lowers her eyes .
ISABEL: Could it be so ?
BROTHER BUYL: Yes , Your Majesty .
SANCHEZ: But there is worse . From the eginning , he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor , treating them equally with the Indians , all of them reduced to slavery . When the nobleman Adrian de Moxica protested against such treatment he was executed . Is that not true also , Brothe Buyl ?
BROTHER BUYL: Yes , Your Honor . It is all true . All of it . I saw it with my own eyes .
SANCHEZ: He has lost control . His great arrogance has led him into depravity . He encourages ou soldiers to marry the native women . He promised a paradise , but he has made a hell full of all its horrors . Silence .
ISABEL: Is that the man I knew , Treasure Sanchez ?
SANCHEZ: Yes , Your Majesty .
COLUMBUS: Fernando !
FERNANDO: Diego !
COLUMBUS: Diego ! Are n't you going to kiss your brother ?
MARCHENA: Diego , take Fernando to the dining hall . He must be hungry .
DIEGO: Yes , Father .
MARCHENA: Diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious Brothers should be raised together , Colon . Even brothers from different mothers
COLUMBUS: Father , I am doing what I think is the best for him . And he has the teacher I would have chosen fo myself . MARCHENA laughs at the compliment .
MARCHENA: Just be careful you do n't lose him .
COLUMBUS: God That 's in a week !
MARCHENA: That 's what it says .
COLUMBUS: How did you manage it ?
MARCHENA: With some difficulty . I had to promise them you were not a total fool .
COLUMBUS: To open a new route to Asia . At the moment there are only two ways of eaching it
MARCHENA: How can you be so certain ? The Ocean is said to be infinite .
COLUMBUS: Ignorance ! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands .
MARCHENA: How can you be so certain ?
COLUMBUS: The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr , Esdras
MARCHENA: Esdras is a Jew .
COLUMBUS: So was Christ !
MARCHENA: Two minutes and already you 're a dead man . Do n't let passion overwhelm you , Colon .
COLUMBUS: I 'll try to remember that , Marchena
MARCHENA: Father Marchena !
COLUMBUS: Passion is something one can not control !
MARCHENA: You get so carried away when you are eing contradicted !
COLUMBUS: I 've been contradicted all my life Eternity !
MARCHENA: Only God knows the meaning of such words , my son .
COLUMBUS: Diego .
DIEGO: I am happy , Father .
FERNANDO: Look , Father !
COLUMBUS: Fernando !
BEATRIX: I know .
COLUMBUS: I have n't given you much of a life .
BEATRIX: Well that 's true . I have a child y a man who wo n't marry me ! Who 's always leaving
COLUMBUS: Are we going to argue ?
BEATRIX: I 'd love to argue with you sometimes . But you 're never here ! They laugh and kiss .
COLUMBUS: Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman
BEATRIX: I find that hard to believe .
COLUMBUS: Fernando , do n't you think we are lucky to live with such a beautiful woman ? He winks at FERNANDO . BEATRIX smiles .
MONK: Christopher Columbus ?
AROJAZ: You say Asia can be found by sailing west ?
COLUMBUS: Yes , your Eminence . The voyage should not take more than six o seven weeks .
AROJAZ: Unfortunately , Don Colon , that is precisely where our opinions differ Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle ? Erathostene ? Ptolemeus ?
COLUMBUS: I am , Your Eminence
AROJAZ: Then you can not ignore that according to their calculations , the circumference of the Earth is approximately 22,000 leagues or more . Which makes the ocean uncrossable .
COLUMBUS: Your Excellencies are aware of the statements of Marin de Tyr ?
AROJAZ: Marin de Tyr is wrong and has een corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers . Your voyage , Don Colon , would take a year !
VICUNA: How would the crew survive without eing able to land for fresh water ? Water is undrinkable after six weeks ! You 'd never be able to turn ack !
COLUMBUS: We would n't have to turn back ! We would find land at this point !
AROJAZ: Senor Colon , an experienced captain such as yourself will understand ou concern with the crew . I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment .
COLUMBUS: Excellency , you are right . Instantly , the protests stop .
AROJAZ: Your life , and that of others !
COLUMBUS: If they agree to follow me , yes .
AROJAZ: Is that all that interests you ? Gold ?
COLUMBUS: No . The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people . I , too , will find other populations and bring them to the word of God . THE MONK smiles thinly .
AROJAZ: Christopher Christo Ferens the Bearer of the Cross !
MONK: And Colon the one who populates ! Another small rill of laughter .
AROJAZ: If God intended our proximity to Asia , do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ?
COLUMBUS: Did He not choose a carpenter 's son to reveal Himself to the world ?
AROJAZ: So you consider yourself the chosen one ? A pause .
COLUMBUS: Blind faith is what I conside heresy !
AROJAZ: IF-GOD-WILLS-IT !
SANCHEZ: The State has some reason to be interested in this man 's proposition , Your Eminence
AROJAZ: The Judgment is ours !
SANCHEZ: Naturally . But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a dispute over a point of geography .
AROJAZ: He is a mercenary ! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions ?
SANCHEZ: Indeed . The world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them , when it benefits them . My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain .
AROJAZ: You would use your influence to assist this intriguer ? SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry .
SANCHEZ: You know , Your Eminence , the fascinating thing about power , is that what can be given so effortlessly
MARCHENA: and therefore nothing could justify the participation of You Highnesses in the venture that elies upon such feeble assumptions , and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical if not impossible .
COLUMBUS: They did n't listen . They did n't want to listen ! He paces about the book-lined room .
MARCHENA: You must n't give way to despair . You must wait .
COLUMBUS: Wait ! I 've waited seven years already ! How much longer do you want me to wait ?
MARCHENA: If God intends you to go , then you will go .
COLUMBUS: Damn God ! MARCHENA is shocked .
MARCHENA: Colon !
COLUMBUS: Damn all of you ! You all set up theories based on what ? You neve leave the safety of your studies ! Go out ! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to !
MARCHENA: No ! My books !
COLUMBUS: All of them ! Just lies !
MARCHENA: Colon ! Do n't !
FERNANDO: Father ?
DIEGO: Sssshhhh ! One ca n't speak to a man doing penance .
FERNANDO: What can you do ?
DIEGO: Nothing . That 's the point , Fernando .
PINZON: Ah , thank God ! I 've been looking all over Seville for you ! Neve expected to find a sailor in a monastery , eh ?
COLUMBUS: Where can I meet this man ?
PINZON: Immediately .
SANTANGEL: These people built Granada Centuries ago ! It is a great victory over the Moors , Don Colon and yet what a tragedy it is !
COLUMBUS: Is this a good time to meet her ?
SANTANGEL: It could n't be better . Victors ca n't say no .
ISABEL: Rise ! Come forward !
COLUMBUS: No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors .
ISABEL: The ocean is uncrossable ?
COLUMBUS: What did they say about Granada efore today ?
ISABEL: That she was impregnable . ISABEL smiles again .
COLUMBUS: Surely you can do anything you want .
ISABEL: How little you know .
COLUMBUS: May I speak freely ?
ISABEL: You show no inclination to speak otherwise !
COLUMBUS: I know what I see . I see someone who does n't accept the world as it is . Who 's not afraid . I see a women who thinks `` What if ? ''
ISABEL: A woman ? A slight pause .
COLUMBUS: Forgive me but you 're the only Queen I know . She bursts out laughing .
ISABEL: Then we are equal since you are the only sailor I know ! A beat .
COLUMBUS: Thirty seven , Your Majesty And you ?
ISABEL: Thirty eight A pause .
COLUMBUS: Actually , I thought you were younge than me ! And he goes out , leaving her stunned .
ADMINISTRATOR: and he demands he DEMANDS to e made a Knight , with the right to ear the Golden Spurs ! He will eceive the title of Don Cristobal Colon which will be extended to his descendants for ever more
SANCHEZ: Go on !
ADMINISTRATOR: He will be named Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea . Viceroy of the West Indies Governor of all islands o lands discovered or as will be discovered with his help The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again .
SANCHEZ: Furthermore he will receive one eight of all wealth or monies , precious gems , pearls , metals , spices and other lucrative sources conquered within the boundaries of his admiralty He smiles , hands the document back .
ADMINISTRATOR: Underdone ! It 's monstrous , Excellency !
SANCHEZ: No , the pheasant . It 's almost raw . And he carries on eating .
COLUMBUS: I WO N'T !
SANCHEZ: We have considered your demands very carefully , Senor Colon You expectations are excessive , in every way .
COLUMBUS: If I am right , my requests are fair ! SANCHEZ holds up a document .
SANCHEZ: We have prepared our own contract
COLUMBUS: No
SANCHEZ: No ?
COLUMBUS: NO ! I have waited too long , fought too hard . Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit ! No I will not be your servant !
SANCHEZ: I remind you , Senor Colon , that you are in no position to bargain with me .
COLUMBUS: I 'm not bargaining !
SANCHEZ: Then you are too ambitious . COLUMBUS leans over the table , faces him .
COLUMBUS: And were you never ambitious , Excellency ? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles , a fault fo the rest of us ?
SANCHEZ: If you wo n't accept our proposal , we 'll simply find someone who will . COLUMBUS smiles .
COLUMBUS: If you can do that , Excellency I 'll become a monk !
ISABEL: You were right , Don Sanchez His demands could never be granted .
SANCHEZ: Never , Your Majesty . Although She turns , questioningly , towards him .
ISABEL: Yes . It would be a pity , would n't it ? Call him back !
COLUMBUS: YEEEEEEES !
BEATRIX: Thank God
COLUMBUS: If I ever come back , I swear I will
BEATRIX: I 'm not asking you to swear to anything .
COLUMBUS: I do n't want you to wait for me .
BEATRIX: That 's something you ca n't decide . COLUMBUS kisses her .
COLUMBUS: Why not ?
FERNANDO: I want to go with you !
COLUMBUS: There 'll be a time .
FERNANDO: You promise ? Do you swear on St. Christopher ?
COLUMBUS: Yes Yes , I do On all of them ! And he hugs his SON tightly .
MARCHENA: In Nomine Patris et Filius , et Spiritus Sancti .
COLUMBUS: Forgive me , Father . For I have sinned . MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS ' voice .
MARCHENA: I am listening , my son .
COLUMBUS: Father , I have betrayed my family . I betrayed my men . And I betrayed you .
MARCHENA: What are you saying ?
COLUMBUS: I lied . The journey will be longe than I said .
MARCHENA: How long ?
COLUMBUS: I am not sure It could be twice the distance . A pause .
MARCHENA: May God forgive you ! You must tell them ! You must tell your men !
COLUMBUS: If I tell them , they wo n't follow me . You know that I am right , Father . You trust me
MARCHENA: My son , my son Your certitudes are sometimes frightening Christopher , you must speak to them . And if you do n't I will .
COLUMBUS: You are bound by an oath , Father . A long silence .
MARCHENA: I believed in you
COLUMBUS: Give me absolution . No response .
BEATRIX: Speak to Diego .
COLUMBUS: Diego ! Here !
SANTANGEL: Take care of my investment , whereve you 're going !
COLUMBUS: I have to tell you Santangel . I do n't know where on earth I am going ! They both laugh .
SAILOR: Vaya con Dios ! They wave back .
COLUMBUS: Due west , Captain Mendez . And may God be with us
MENDEZ: God be with us admiral .
COLUMBUS: What is it Mendez ? Speak !
MENDEZ: Well It 's the men , Sir . They wonder how you know our position . We 've lost sight from land days ago
COLUMBUS: And what do you think Mendez ?
MENDEZ: Well , I surely know what a quadrant is ! But I 've never seen it used at night before .
COLUMBUS: Come over here .
MENDEZ: Twenty eight . MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS .
COLUMBUS: That 's it . The twenty eighth parallel . And we 'll follow it until we reach land . ALONSO does not seem convinced .
ALONSO: How do you know land is on the twenty eighth parallel ?
SAILOR: The water 's going putrid in the arrels .
ALONSO: You 'll be drinking your own piss For the glory of Spain and Admiral Colon ! Bastard ! The SHIP 'S BOY glances round at them .
SAILOR: Ah , leave him alone . He 's doing no harm .
ALONSO: With a face like that ? I do n't want you looking at me . You hear ?
SAILOR: We 'll all go crazy
ALONSO: We should have seen land .
SAILOR: We left three weeks ago , Alonso . Ca n't be that near .
ALONSO: Ca n't be that far , I say . Also , I do n't like the smell of the sea around here . Smells like a cunt . Bad sign The COOK starts laughing . They turn to him .
COOK: Of course it smells like it ! That 's why sailors take to the sea !
ALONSO: And why does this one take to the sea ? Nobody knows . Never says a word
MENDEZ: To your post ! At once ! They split in silence .
SHIP'S BOY: Mark . Twenty nine , Sir !
COLUMBUS: Six hundred and twenty nine .
SHIP'S BOY: Six hundred and twenty nine !
OFFICER: Six hundred and twenty nine , Sir ! PINZON does not seem too pleased .
PINZON: I heard . THE OFFICER examines his own calculations .
OFFICER: Captain , I do n't understand .
PINZON: I think I do . He goes back to his cabin .
MENDEZ: Continue rowing !
ALONSO: To where ?
OFFICER: Captain Pinzon requests permission to board .
COLUMBUS: Granted .
PINZON: You lied ! You cheated ! We 're way past 750 leagues !
COLUMBUS: Six days ago , yes .
PINZON: You must be mad !
COLUMBUS: We have to keep the hopes of these men alive !
PINZON: We 're on the verge of a mutiny , Colon !
COLUMBUS: You think I do n't know that ?
PINZON: We 're lost !
COLUMBUS: The land is there . I know it !
PINZON: You do n't know anything ! Listen Colon , these are my ships , right ? So I 'm telling you we 're turning ack !
COLUMBUS: And then what ? Half of the wate has gone , the rest is nearly putrid ! You know that !
PINZON: Jesus Maria ! I should have neve listened to you !
COLUMBUS: You never did . You did all the talking for both of us , remember ?
PINZON: You bloody
COLUMBUS: Pinzon , Pinzon All we can do now is go forward ! Think about that !
PINZON: You tell that to them !
COLUMBUS: You 're right . Let the men decide .
ALONSO: God does n't want us to cross the ocean ! This voyage is cursed ! Some of the MEN murmur their agreement .
COLUMBUS: Cursed ?
ALONSO: We set sail for greed . God has abandoned us . The voyage is cursed . There are signs
COLUMBUS: This boy has the voice of an angel . What comes out of his mouth is lessed , Alonso . What comes out of your is evil .
MENDEZ: Alonso ! Jaime ! Do n't let this wind escape us .
PINZON: You lucky bastard
COLUMBUS: Pinzon , the more I sail , the luckie I get . Turning abruptly , he enters his cabin .
MENDEZ: Shall I take my turn ?
COLUMBUS: Mendez ! Mendez ! MENDEZ grimaces , and opens one eye .
SHIP'S BOY: TIERRA ! TIERRA !
COLUMBUS: By the by the Grace of God
MENDEZ: Arquebuses !
PINZON: Colon !
COLUMBUS: We have come here in peace , and we will behave with honor . They are not savages and neither will you be . Treat these people as you would you own wives and your own children . Neither are you free to take what you will ; for a seashell you give a andana . You will respect thei eliefs . Pillage will be punished y the whip . Rape by the sword .
PINZON: Gold ! Gold !
COLUMBUS: Give it to him !
PINZON: By God ! That 's the worst trade of my life !
OLD INDIAN: Cuba ! Cuba !
UTAPAN: Say not here ! Cuba !
COLUMBUS: What is it ? A tribe ? An island ?
UTAPAN: Island . Far .
COLUMBUS: Help him !
SAILOR: Do something ! Help him !
UTAPAN: He dead .
COLUMBUS: Utapan ! Wait !
PINZON: Well You 'll have to continue without me
COLUMBUS: No . It 's enough . What would you say to a drop of Jerez , Pinzon ? PINZON grins .
PINZON: And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb ! I 'd sell my soul for it . Help me up . I 've got to piss , gold .
UTAPAN: He cures . COLUMBUS nods he obviously trusts UTAPAN .
COLUMBUS: Tell the Chief we thank him .
UTAPAN: Chief knows .
COLUMBUS: Tell him his country is very eautiful . Tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort . UTAPAN translates .
UTAPAN: Chief says how many ?
COLUMBUS: Thousands .
UTAPAN: Why ?
COLUMBUS: To bring the word of God .
UTAPAN: Chief says he has a God .
COLUMBUS: and also to bring medicine .
UTAPAN: Chief says
COLUMBUS: He has medicine . Tell him we admire his people . UTAPAN translates .
UTAPAN: Chief says he knows you like his Women
COLUMBUS: That 's a beginning
AROJAZ: It wo n't be easy to get rid of you prophet now , Don Sanchez .
SANCHEZ: On the contrary , Your Eminence . It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross .
COLUMBUS: You must not inhale , but simply allow the palate to enjoy the flavo of the Tobacco
MOXICA: And you say this is an Indian vice ? By God ! I do n't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin .
COLUMBUS: The Indians have no such word , Don Moxica .
ISABEL: Do they have such thoughts ?
COLUMBUS: They come and go as naked as the day God created them ISABEL blushes slightly .
SANCHEZ: Forgive me , Don Colon . But what about gold ?
COLUMBUS: These are gifts for Your Majesty .
ISABEL: We are more than gratified .
MASTER: Si ! Si ! Muy bien ! Excellente !
SANCHEZ: You defend yourself admirably
COLUMBUS: for a commoner ? SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass .
SANCHEZ: To your second expedition .
BOBADILLA: I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands ? Is it not so ?
COLUMBUS: Forgive me , Don Bobadilla those positions have already been taken .
BOBADILLA: May I ask by whom ?
COLUMBUS: Bartolome and Giacomo Colon .
BOBADILLA: I trust they are men of quality . BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ .
COLUMBUS: But we do have a lack of notaries . You should contact my administration .
SANCHEZ: Don Bobadilla is already a judge , my Dear Don Cristobal .
COLUMBUS: Good ! We are also in need of judges . Except there are no thieves ! A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA .
BOBADILLA: I see I was mistaken . Don Colon has no need for my services
SANCHEZ: You seem to have a special talent for making friends .
COLUMBUS: What ? Do I have so many already ?
SANCHEZ: To rise so high , in so short a time , is a dangerous occupation . A little hypocrisy goes a long way .
BARTOLOME: You might have given us a choice !
GIACOMO: Bartolome is stronger , more capable than I will ever be
COLUMBUS: I need both of you . What are you afraid of ? We are living what we always dreamt of .
GIACOMO: You know I never shared those dreams with you .
COLUMBUS: Are you saying you refuse to help ?
BARTOLOME: You bastard you always had you own way
COLUMBUS: Let me show you something . He opens the door to a terrace .
SOLDIER: Where is the Admiral ? Has anyone seen the Admiral ? Everybody laughs .
COLUMBUS: He is here ! What is it ?
MAN: Admiral ! The horses have arrived .
COLUMBUS: I know . I saw them ! Who did we hire today ? ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes .
ASSISTANT: Thirty blacksmiths , twenty eight halberdiers , twenty carpenters , a hundred farmers , twenty miners and Doctor Chanca , the royal surgeon .
COLUMBUS: The royal surgeon ? Then we can count on royal health ! The whole courtyard bursts out laughing .
BEATRIX: You do n't usually ask .
COLUMBUS: I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service . BEATRIX stops in her tracks , looks at him .
BEATRIX: For once I wish you were n't right .
MOXICA: Is this your new world , Don Colon ?
GUEVARA: These animals should be shown what savagery can be !
NOBLEMAN: Three heads for every life taken . No mercy before God !
GUEVARA: No mercy ! Let 's find them .
COLUMBUS: No Guevara . There will be no evenge . Silence . Everyone looks at COLUMBUS .
MOXICA: We lost cousins , friends . We will wash this in blood .
COLUMBUS: If you want to keep your head on your shoulders , you 'll do as I say . They are all listening .
MOXICA: We do n't need to know .
COLUMBUS: We came here to stay ! To build ! Not to start a crusade . In this forest , there is enough danger to sweep us away in days ! So we will e brave and swallow our grief . And in the name of those who died , we will accomplish what we came for .
UTAPAN: They here .
COLUMBUS: Ask the Chief what happened to my men ? The CHIEF answers .
UTAPAN: Another tribe made war on them came by sea took them away
BROTHER BUYL: God have mercy on their souls
MOXICA: The monkey is lying .
COLUMBUS: No ! you 'll do it my way . Tell the Chief we will not harm his people , even though we have the power to do it .
UTAPAN: He understands .
COLUMBUS: Ask him if he will help .
MOXICA: My horse does n't work .
COLUMBUS: Don Moxica we all have to work .
MOXICA: You did not hear me , Don Colon . Not my horse .
COLUMBUS: Forgive me , Don Moxica . But it was your horse I was talking about .
MOXICA: To the Governor of the Mosquitoes !
GUEVARA: To the new world , my friend ! To the new world !
GIACOMO: Nima 's a good cook !
BARTOLOME: She 's more than that !
GIACOMO: What is it ?
COLUMBUS: Eat ! I 'll tell you later .
GIACOMO: I 'd like to know what I 'm eating .
COLUMBUS: Iguana .
GIACOMO: I 'm not an Indian .
BARTOLOME: He wishes he were back in the seminary . Priests always eat well . And they have very good cellars .
GIACOMO: Nothing grows here ! Everything rots in the ground . The wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them .
COLUMBUS: We 've got to learn to live like the Indians . Eat your Iguana !
BARTOLOME: Not enough to justify a single shipment .
COLUMBUS: Perhaps it does n't exist anywhere ut in my imagination .
BARTOLOME: Then let 's hope not What will happen if we ca n't find enough gold ?
COLUMBUS: Then I 'm Governor of the Mosquitoes .
BROTHER BUYL: What kind of disease is this ?
DOCTOR CHANCA: I do n't know . It seems almost as if we have exchanged diseases with the Indians . They die of our most common cold , and we of their plague .
BROTHER BUYL: God forgive us !
DOCTOR: It seems to be caused by intimacy with the native women , Your Majesty .
ISABEL: Will he survive ?
DOCTOR: No , Your Majesty . They go mad then they die . There is nothing we can do . ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ , appalled .
SANCHEZ: Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying . But with no gold ! The new world proves expensive , You Majesty .
ISABEL: We were n't expecting immediate profits , were we ? We must have faith . We must give time for time .
TRANSLATOR: He says he has not found any !
MOXICA: He 's lying !
CLERK: Don Giacomo , you 'd better come at once !
MOXICA: Tell them I want them to watch this !
CLERK: Do n't Moxica ! You ca n't
MOXICA: I ca n't ? I ca n't ?
COLUMBUS: In one act of brutality , you have created chaos . Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us ! All that because of your criminal savagery !
MOXICA: Savagery is what monkeys understand .
COLUMBUS: You 'll be held in detention , deprived of your privileges and possessions . Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged . Have you anything to say ?
MOXICA: You will regret this .
SOLDIER: You animals ! Ca n't you wait !
BARTOLOME: Moxica is right . Our ways do n't work ! BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN .
COLUMBUS: You have to find them , Utapan . Look what they did !
UTAPAN: You did the same to your God ! COLUMBUS is caught short .
COLUMBUS: We have to stop this war .
GIACOMO: Moxica
MOXICA: You know what they will say in Spain about my death do n't you ?
BROTHER BUYL: I wish to go back with them , Don Colon . I have no desire to remain in this godless place .
COLUMBUS: You may do as you please , Brothe Buyl though your departure will not help me to make it more Godly .
BROTHER BUYL: You treat Christians equally with heathen savages . You execute members of the nobility . And what do you offer in return ?
COLUMBUS: A new world , Brother Buyl .
BROTHER BUYL: Nobody wants one ! Only you ! And he walks away .
COLUMBUS: Perhaps hope only exists in the journey . When it begins , everything is still possible every expectation ; every dream The BROTHERS do not answer .
UTAPAN: You never learned how to speak my language . UTAPAN is gone .
INDIANS: Urracan Urracan Urracan Urracan
COLUMBUS: Let it go ! Let it go !
SANCHEZ: But there is worse . He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility
ISABEL: Is this true , Brother Buyl ?
BROTHER BUYL: Yes , Your Majesty . It is all true . I saw it with my own eyes .
ISABEL: Then , what do you suggest , Don Sanchez ?
SANCHEZ: He must be replaced .
ISABEL: And who would you think of , for such a task ?
BOBADILLA: Don Alonso de Bobadilla .
COLUMBUS: Yes I remember
BOBADILLA: My letters of appointment .
COLUMBUS: Appointment to what ?
BOBADILLA: Viceroy of the West Indies .
COLUMBUS: Congratulations . Then I am free to search for the mainland .
BOBADILLA: Did n't you learn ? The mainland was discovered . Weeks ago . By anothe Italian . I forgot his name .
COLUMBUS: How far from here ?
BOBADILLA: I am not a seaman . But I heard it is no more than a week at sea . I hope you are not too disappointed .
COLUMBUS: How could I be ? The mainland has een found . Exactly as I said it would .
BOBADILLA: I am afraid this is not the worst news .
FERNANDO: Father ?
COLUMBUS: Fernando ! My God !
DIEGO: Santangel is going to see the Queen . We are going to get you out of here .
COLUMBUS: Good ! I have to go back !
DIEGO: Go back ?
COLUMBUS: I have to explore the mainland .
FERNANDO: This time with me !
DIEGO: In your present state it is madness , Father ! FERNANDO glances at DIEGO .
FERNANDO: Nobody is forcing you to come with us . DIEGO is hurt .
DIEGO: I ca n't go anyway . A pause .
FERNANDO: She 's very beautiful ! The Queen has very good taste . Diego is getting married .
COLUMBUS: I am happy for you , Diego .
SANTANGEL: Granted his faults . Yes , a hundred times ! But the man is still emarkable .
SANCHEZ: It does not belong to him .
SANTANGEL: In a way , it does , Don Sanchez . I beg Your Majesty to receive him . To hear him He will make no more demands . He has changed . He is penitent .
SANCHEZ: Penitent ? He is suing us fo each of contract !
ISABEL: Is he ? She starts to laugh .
COLUMBUS: Now I do look older than you .
ISABEL: We have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new world
COLUMBUS: Thank you .
ISABEL: There is one thing I 'd like to understand Why do you want to go ack , after all this ?
COLUMBUS: Your Majesty some men are content to read about things . I must see them with my own eyes . I can not be other than I am .
ISABEL: I know , I should not tolerate his impertinence .
SANCHEZ: Then why ?
ISABEL: Because he is not afraid of me .
SANCHEZ: All I have to do is call the guards .
COLUMBUS: Call them .
SANCHEZ: I am not afraid of you . You are nothing but a dreamer .
COLUMBUS: Look out of that window .
SANCHEZ: Roofs towers , palaces spires
COLUMBUS: All of them created by people like me . SANCHEZ turns round again to face him .
BEATRIX: They tried but I did n't let them .
COLUMBUS: Not everything Do you think I care ? I 'm a free man again . Riches do n't make a man rich , they only make him busier They laugh . There 's a pause .
SANTANGEL: On the contrary . It is I who owe you everything . Through you , I have een an adventurer , an explorer ! It 's true I shall never see the new world but it 's here And here
COLUMBUS: But as least we have n't been bored , have we ? They all laugh , and drink .
SAILOR'S VOICE: West southwest , Captain Mendez
COLUMBUS: How are you feeling , Fernando ?
FERNANDO: Not bad .
COLUMBUS: You know what I always used to do ? FERNANDO shakes his head .
MENDEZ: What 's he doing ?
COLUMBUS: He 's drawing an isthmus He 's saying we 're on an isthmus .
MENDEZ: We ca n't be .
COLUMBUS: Tell me what he 's saying .
TRANSLATOR: He says water on the other side .
COLUMBUS: Ask him if he means a lake . A big lake .
TRANSLATOR: No . Says those are lakes . Water on other side big as wide as here . Above and below , much land .
COLUMBUS: An ocean ? He 's says it 's an ocean ?
FERNANDO: I do n't understand .
COLUMBUS: Here is Europe and over here , the continent of Asia . But there 's something in between ! Anothe continent ! We 've found anothe continent !
FERNANDO: Father
COLUMBUS: There must be a passage to that other ocean .
TRANSLATOR: I help .
FERNANDO: Oh my God The remains of human beings .
COLUMBUS: What is ?
SOLDIER: Oh Virgen Maria Oh Madre de Dios But as he vomits and cries , he notices
COLUMBUS: Out ! Get out !
DUENA: `` I should be judged as a Seaman who y Divine Will discovered a New World , and thereby placed it unde the sovereignty of Your Majesties . I humbly beseech Your Majesties that if it pleases God to remove me hence , you will help the name of Columbus to be remembered with honor Weep for me , whoever has charity , truth and justice . ''
AROJAZ: West by south west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo . From there , west north west , leaving San Juan to the north , reaching the island of Hispanola on the northern cape of San Raphael Then onto the mainland , at the Cape called Gracias a Dios We continue to rise up the tiers of seats
SANCHEZ: You can see for yourself .
AROJAZ: What a tragedy what a waste of a life
SANCHEZ: A waste ? Let me tell you something , Arojaz . If your name , o mine , is ever remembered it will only be because of his .
MARCHENA: I suppose we 're both old men now .
COLUMBUS: You 'll always be older than me , Father .
MARCHENA: Yes . I forgave you a long time ago . You see , I was proud of you . You were like a willful child . You would n't accept what others told you . You had to find things out fo yourself , hurting yourself and others in the process .
COLUMBUS: I have to disagree .
MARCHENA: I knew you would .
COLUMBUS: New worlds create new people .
MARCHENA: Oh ? So you are a new man ?
COLUMBUS: I do n't know I have the impression that I did n't change that much . I still ca n't accept the world as it is ! MARCHENA starts laughing .
MARCHENA: God bless you , and those like you ! They both laugh .
COLUMBUS: Ca n't you stay with us a little ?
BEATRIX: I am busy inside .
COLUMBUS: I ca n't keep my eyes off you . I would like to catch up with all the moments I did n't spend with you .
FERNANDO: I am not listening , Father . But I ca n't help hearing . FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly .
COLUMBUS: But how is he ? And Dona Maria ? FERNANDO continues to read .
FERNANDO: Fine , it seems . Diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade , in Santo Domingo He says he received many letters for you . Some of your men , mostly . He opens one of them , glances at it .
COLUMBUS: What does he say ?
FERNANDO: He asks when he can come to visit you . He left his address .
COLUMBUS: He never had one except aboard my ships ! FERNANDO laughs then , suddenly serious .
FERNANDO: I want you to tell me everything you emember , Father . From the eginning . Everything .
COLUMBUS: Really ? God I would n't know where to start and yet
FERNANDO: Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind .
COLUMBUS: I remember
EMIL: Do n't fool around .
OLEG: Okay .
EMIL: Did you hear what I said ?
OLEG: I want to document my trip to America .
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: Next . Could I see your documents , please ?
EMIL: Yes sir .
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: What is your intended purpose of you visit to the United States ?
EMIL: Two weeks holiday .
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: How much money are you carrying with you ?
EMIL: I have five-hundred dollars .
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: Can you show me ? Sir , no cameras in the FIS area !
EMIL: Yes .

I go to get the cigar and BOOM ! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go . Right where I was standin ' . That coulda been it . I coulda had my head blown off and fo what ? Some stupid kid got panicky , takes the safety off and it 's over . If I had n't gone back for that cigar - fo a bad habit - I would 've had my head lown off .

HAWKINS: Another martini .
LEON: Coffee for me , I got ta slow down .
EDDIE: Vodka tonic .
LEON: Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell ?
EDDIE: What 's the kid gon na say - sorry ? Meanwhile I 'm not here anymore . Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan . Six hours ago this guy was walkin ' his dog or buyin ' a quart of milk . Who knows ? But some kid 's robbed him for $ 3 or some shit and shot him and now you ca n't tell if he 's a piece of beef or a human being and I 'm thinkin ' that 's me . Sooner or later . That 's me .
HAWKINS: Sooner or later that 's everybody .

Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids , I wanted to vomit . Now I get it . Am I ight , Leon ?
LEON: Absomotherfuckin'lutely . You can have all three of my ex-wives . But somebody so much as looks sideways at my fou girls I 'd kill 'em . You have n't seen my youngest have you ?
HAWKINS: Paulie , you 've got kids , right ?

EMIL: Milos . Get my money ! Oleg videotapes the scene .
MILOS: We spent it !
EMIL: Ha . Ha .
MILOS: Look at the way we live . I 'm a plumber . You think I 'd be working if I had money ? !
EMIL: A job ?
MILOS: Yes , the money is good .

MUGGER: Got any spare change ? How 'bout a spare twenty ?
JORDY: Look , I do n't have time for you , get out of my way ! !
MUGGER: Alright , how 'bout all your fuckin ' money ?
JORDY: Okay , you 're under arrest ! Now you happy ?
MUGGER: Fire Department ? Firemen do n't carry guns .
JORDY: Oh yeah ? Guess again .
MUGGER: Hey . C'mon , you ca n't leave me like this . Some freak 'll come by and sta me ! Jordy jogs off across the park .
LOUIE: Lieutenant - take up your line and elieve Ladder Company 60 on the top floor .
JORDY: Hey , Louie , were you first due ?
LOUIE: Yeah , I radioed you guys right away 'cause you got two roasts on the top floor but you do n't hafta investigate cause homicide is up there .
JORDY: Homicide ? Who let them up ? I did n't make it a crime scene yet .
LOUIE: Hey , it 's Eddie Flemming .
JORDY: I heard . Who the hell let them up there ?
KORFIN: I do n't know , you think Eddie will give me his autograph ?
JORDY: You see anything in the crowd ? Anybody suspicious ?
KORFIN: Naw - I 'm sure the suspect 's not here .
JORDY: Oh yeah , why ?
KORFIN: 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now !
LEON: So , it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin ' each other but were so whacked out of thei heads they set the pipe on the mattress , lit it up , and they got fried . What do you think , Eddie ?
EDDIE: I do n't know . We got the experts here . Show them what you found - I hope you do n't mind , we came over to see if we could help .
KORFIN: Nah , not at all . Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin . My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie .
JORDY: Could you put out the cigar ? Part of the job is picking up scents .
EDDIE: Oh , sure .
LEON: Well , I found - check it out - crack pipe . Looks like they got careless .
KORFIN: Sorry , bro .
JORDY: Hey , that 's great you guys got it all wrapped up , but you do n't mind if we go through the routine ? It gives us somethin ' to do .
EDDIE: No , we do n't mind . You mind Leon ?
LEON: No . Go ahead .
JORDY: Thanks . Appreciate it .
KORFIN: Okay , Jordy - it was a fast fire , we got good patterns - about thirty minutes old .
JORDY: Mouth 's clean , too .
KORFIN: Clean ?
JORDY: Do n't blow your nose !
KORFIN: But you knew that , right ?
JORDY: So the way you see it , two crack heads urned themselves up ?
LEON: That 's what it looks like to me .
JORDY: And while they 're burning up , they 're still goin ' down on each other ? You got to hand it to them .
LEON: Yeah , well , some people got thei priorities straight .
JORDY: Evidence . Of a homicide .
EDDIE: No , what is it ?
JORDY: Why do n't you explain it , Bobby . Hey Camello ! You mind punching a hole in the floor ?
CAMELLO: No problem . Excuse me , gentlemen . You might wan na ack up a little more . Do n't wan na get your pants wet .
KORFIN: They have not soot in their mouths , which means they were n't breathin ' efore the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something , probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed . To the untrained eye , it looks like an accident .
LEON: What 's he looking for ?
EDDIE: A timer .
KORFIN: Here you go . A big double homicide .
JORDY: He knew all along .
KORFIN: What ? ?
JORDY: That 's why he was so quiet . He was testing us .
NICOLETTE: Detective , does it look like a murder ?
EDDIE: We do n't know that yet . It 's much too early . There 's a lot to be done .
NICOLETTE: How many victims are up there ?
EDDIE: There are two bodies found at this point .
NICOLETTE: Can we go up to the crime scene ?
EDDIE: You know you ca n't do that . C'mon .
NICOLETTE: Is it drug related ?
EDDIE: We do n't know . When I have more I 'll let you know .
NICOLETTE: Detectivewhat 's that you 're holding in your hand ? Evidence ?
KORFIN: What ?
JORDY: There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us . She looked scared . Oh shit ! Oh no !
MUGGER: You motherfuckin ' bastard ! She stripped me ! It was a bag lady ! She touched me all over , it was disgusting . Jordy unlocks the handcuffs .
JORDY: I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . Korfin delivers a blanket . Jordy covers him .
MUGGER: A dog pissed on me ! ! I 'm gon na sue you for this ! You violated my civil rights !
JORDY: Your civil rights ? ! You tried to ro me ! I could arrest you right now ! You 're lucky you 're walking away from this . Now get outta here .
EMIL: Self-esteem ? Self-esteem ? ?
OLEG: I 'm not filming . I 'm watching Milos die . It 's just like a move but realer . Emil grabs the videocamera . Do n't break it ! Do n't break it !
EMIL: Speak English !
OLEG: You said speak Czech !
EMIL: How you erase this ?
OLEG: I 'll do it . Do n't hurt my camera !
EMIL: Stupid , Milos . I did n't want to kill him . What 's this ?
SEXY VOICE: Hi ?
EMIL: Hello ?
SEXY VOICE: Are you looking for companionship ? Oleg , who 's listening , moves to Emil .
OLEG: Whore ?
EMIL: I 'm homesick . You have Eastern European girl ? A Czech girl ?
SEXY VOICE: Matter of fact , I have a lovely Czech girl .
EMIL: I take her . Send her !
JORDY: Now that you know him , maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him .
KORFIN: Yeah ?
JORDY: Maybe you can be his stand-in .
DUFFY: Who did cause and origin ?
JORDY: Who do you think , Chief ? !
DUFFY: Then why did n't you talk to the eporter ?
JORDY: 'Cause we got more important things to do , like finding out who did it .
DUFFY: Do n't you guys understand ? It 's all about image . The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime .
KORFIN: Yeah , right .
DUFFY: What was that , Korfin ?
KORFIN: I said , yeah , you 're right , Chief . As soon as we get somethin ' we 'll let you alert the media .
DUFFY: You do that , wiseguy . Now let 's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does . They all head upstairs .
GARCIA: Hey guys , I got your torch . He just gave a full confession .
MAX: It 's my fire ! Screw homicide . I 'll tell you guys everything !
JORDY: What 's that on your forehead , Max ? That 's a nice attention getter .
MAX: Yeah , I 'm religious . I 'm not an Atheist like you ! Now , are you guys gon na arrest me , or not ?
JORDY: How did you start the fire this time ?
MAX: I used an accelerant .
JORDY: Yeah ? What kind ?
MAX: Hey , by the way , I 'm really sorry about your wife leavin ' you .
KORFIN: Max .
MAX: Yeah , and with your old man dying last year you - what 's it ? Just you and the dog now ?
KORFIN: Max !
MAX: Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy your ex-wife 's seeing - I hear he 's a ig shot downtown . Jordy pops out of his seat .
JORDY: That 's it ! You 're outta here .
MAX: That 's it . I 'm suing .
KORFIN: Get in line .
JORDY: What 's so funny . How does he know so much about me ? Who tells him my life story ?
GARCIA: He hangs around downstairs . The guys talk to him . He 's a joke
JORDY: He 's no joke ! One day he 's gon na graduate from trash can fires and do something big .
GARCIA: Okay . Okay . We 'll ban him from the station .
ROBERT HAWKINS: Good evening , I 'm Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story . Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store . But now , Mr. Geller 's claim , spoken softly and articulately , is that he is the victim . According to Mr. Geller , the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist . Hard to elievewatch .
STEPHEN GELLER: This had nothing to do with shoes that did n't fit or my relationship with my father who , as you know , made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties . These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor .
ROBERT HAWKINS: Your doctor ?
STEPHEN GELLER: Yes . My psychiatrist did n't insist that I stay on my medication .
ROBERT HAWKINS: so you feel absolutely no esponsibility for killing these people ?
STEPHEN GELLER: It was my finger that pulled the trigger , but I 'm not morally esponsible . My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of . How could I know . I 'm not a doctor .
ROBERT HAWKINS: You seem very savvy for a man who 's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial .
STEPHEN GELLER: Look , I 'm a victim here , too . I was a year away from getting my masters in Art , now I 'll never graduate . My life has been permanently disrupted .
ROBERT HAWKINS: Permanently disrupted ? Are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? Has n't this 'incident ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?
STEPHEN GELLER: Look , I 'm in here . You call this a career move ?
ROBERT HAWKINS: And is n't there a movie in the works about you ?
STEPHEN GELLER: We 're in negotiations , that 's correct .
ROBERT HAWKINS: But does n't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from thei crimes ?
STEPHEN GELLER: That does n't apply to me because I 'm not a criminal . I 'm not a criminal ! I was n't convicted . Emil leans forward - listening . Fascinated .
EMIL: I love America . No one is responsible for what they do .
HONEY: Hi , I 'm Honey .
EMIL: Where 's Czech girl ?
HONEY: Baby , I 'm anybody you want me to be . I 'm a little schoolgirl , I 'm mommy , I 'm a Czech girl . She enters . Closes the door behind her .
EMIL: I ordered a Czech girl . Daphne , you know her ?
HONEY: It 's an outcall service run out of an apartment . I do n't meet the othe girls . Are n't you gon na get undressed ?
EMIL: Where is escort service ?
HONEY: That 's confidential . Could you put the money on the dresser ?
EMIL: I like to talk to the person who runs the service . Can you give me address ?
HONEY: Look . Do we have a problem here ? There 's no reason to have a problem . I 'm gon na make you feel real good . You wan na Czech girl ? After I 'm done with you , you wo n't miss her . Now why do n't you pay me ? She starts to unfasten Emil 's belt .
EMIL: Listen to me . I do n't want sex . Just give me the address and then you go .
HONEY: Look , man , I do n't give a shit if you want sex or not , but you 're payin ' fo my time .
EMIL: Give me the address ! !
HONEY: Alright , alright - do n't hurt me ! Please , it 's in my book , in my purse !
COMPOSITE ARTIST: What about her cheek bones ?
JORDY: Her cheek bones are prominent and he eyes were huge . Big , blue eyes and when I saw her , she looked scared . Like she was looking to get away . But she was absolutely beautiful . The composite artist looks at Jordy .
KORFIN: From Czechoslovakia ? And how long have they been livin ' in your building ? Alright , I 'll be in touch when we know somethin ' . Milos and Tamina Karlova . They were quiet and kept to themselves . Landlord do n't know who your girl is .
JORDY: How long they been livin ' here ?
KORFIN: You hear that question , Garcia ?
GARCIA: Yeah , I got Immigration on the phone - they 've been here illegally .
KORFIN: Well , they 're definitely permanent esidents now .
GARCIA: I got the owner of the plumbing company Milos worked for .
KORFIN: Why do n't we get some sleep and we 'll go see him in the morning .
JORDY: You go home . I 'm takin ' your car and goin ' back to the crime scene .
KORFIN: Are n't you tired ?
JORDY: If I go home I wo n't be able to fall asleep anyway .
KORFIN: She keepin ' you up ? Like to meet her , huh ? She 'd make you forget your ex wife . Cure your insomnia .
EDDIE: Okay to smoke ?
JORDY: It 's your crime scene now . You can do what you want .
EDDIE: Watch the news ?
JORDY: Nah , I musta missed it .
EDDIE: Well , just so you know . I gave you guys the credit .
JORDY: Well , just so you know , I do n't care about that stuff .
EDDIE: Nah , why should you ?
JORDY: I do n't even watch TV .
EDDIE: Good . Good . Commendable . Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup ' back .
JORDY: Did you get a report from the M.E . ?
EDDIE: Sure . But I would like to ask you something . You got a problem with me ?
JORDY: If you found me steppin ' on your crime scene - it might piss you off , too . What about the report ?
EDDIE: You were right , they were both dead efore the fire . The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine . That 's usually an indicator of something personal .
JORDY: The Super said he 'd seen her before but she did n't live here .
EDDIE: Pretty .
JORDY: Hmmmm .
EDDIE: Maybe you do n't care about that either . Prettiest suspect I 've had in awhile .
JORDY: Who says she 's a suspect ?
EDDIE: What would you call her ?
JORDY: Look , I 'm not even sure she has anything to do with this . I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead . Maybe she saw something . Maybe she was visiting somebody here . Who knows ?
EDDIE: Obviously they were n't having sex . As you pointed out . So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that ?
JORDY: Maybe it 's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message . Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe . It could be to humiliate them . Just burning them up , no proper funeral , it 's like condemning them to hell .
EDDIE: Eastern Europe . Like what ? Romania ? Hungary ?
JORDY: Or Czechoslovakia . The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years . These are very intense people and they take things personally . Eddie 's cellular rings - he grabs it .
EDDIE: Yeah ? Where ? You sure it was a knife ? Uh-huh . Really ? Okay . We 've got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue . A stabbing . Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian Eddie 's moving with Daphne 's sketch .
JORDY: I 'll come with you .
EDDIE: There was n't a fire . There 'll be nothing for you to do .
JORDY: I can watch you , Eddie . Maybe I 'll learn something .
EDDIE: This is n't homicide school .
JORDY: My parents are from Poland . I can help with the Eastern European angle .
EDDIE: You 're Polish ?
JORDY: My folks are .
EDDIE: Stay here .
OLEG: This is second day in America . First day was very exciting . Full of thrills and chills . Over there , is co-star of my new movie , Emil ! He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL .
EMIL: Who is he ?
VENDOR: New York 's finest . This is his case .
EMIL: Do you know how much killer gets fo movie rights ?
VENDOR: In here , says he wants a million .
EMIL: Million ? ! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview ?
VENDOR: Hey , tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview . And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her ? It pays to e a killer or a whore in this country . Look , you want magazine or not ?
EMIL: Yes . Both .
OLEG: And these .
EMIL: Get a taxi .
BLIND WOMAN: Thank you , son . Emil watches her walk on .
EDDIE: Where is she ?
LEON: Takin ' a bath .
EDDIE: Any I.D . ?
LEON: Still unknown but we 're running prints . Kid over there caught the case . Jordy enters . Leon steps in his way .
EDDIE: It 's okay .
TOMMY: Tommy Cullen . Heard a lot about you . Nice to meet you . Here 's what we got . A girl in there , figure her to be a prostitute , looks like she was fighting for her life . She 's got defense wounds on her hands . Right this way - in the athroom .
EDDIE: After you .
TOMMY: Room was registered to a Francis Capra .
JORDY: Capra ? That 's not Czech or Russian . Who said he sounded Russian ?
TOMMY: The clerk ?
EDDIE: Check the switchboard , see what phone calls were made from this room .
TOMMY: I 'll do it .
MURPHY: Clothes were off in the other room . Tu is dry except for the blood .
EDDIE: Any of you guys take a piss lately ?
LEON: Yeah .
EDDIE: C'mere . You wan na go to homicide school ? Here - make yourself useful .
MURPHY: If you look here where he missed and hit the wall you see that the marks are n't deep but they 're kinda wide not you everyday kitchen or pocket knife .
EDDIE: What if the tip was broken off ?
MURPHY: Could be . Then we should find it here somewhere .
EDDIE: I think we 've already found it .
TOMMY: There was only one call from this room last night . I dialed it . It 's an escort service .
LEON: Did you identify yourself ?
TOMMY: Hey , I 'm new but I 'm not stupid .
EDDIE: Call communications and get an address on that number .
JORDY: You goin ' to the escort service ?
EDDIE: You got any better ideas ?
JORDY: Mind if I ride along with you ?
EDDIE: This has nothing to do with your fire .
JORDY: But what if it does ? You might need my help . As Eddie exits the hotel , a MAN approaches .
MAN: Hey , Eddie , can I get your autograph fo my son ?
EDDIE: I 'll let you know what happens .
JORDY: This is ridiculous . I 'm not gon na be in your way - we can talk the case over .
EDDIE: Tell you what - I 'll flip you a coin . If you win you can come with me . If you do n't win , you do n't come .
JORDY: I 'll call it tails . Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy .
EDDIE: Okay . I 'll call it . Heads . Jordy flips the coin and it 's heads .
JORDY: Two heads .
EDDIE: Better than one .
ROSE: You ! I 've seen you on TV ! Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy .
EDDIE: We do n't have her I.D . yet , but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel .
ROSE: Oh my G-d. Honey ! Honey 's dead ?
JORDY: Do you remember the man who called ?
ROSE: Yeah . He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia , but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there , you know , it does n't really matter - Honey was killed ? Poor girl
EDDIE: Do you have any Czech girls working fo you ?
ROSE: No .
EDDIE: Did you tell him you did ?
ROSE: Boy , she 's so popular all the sudden .
EDDIE: What are you saying ?
ROSE: Daphne . Another guy came in asking me about her , too . Jordy pulls out the sketch , unfolds it .
JORDY: This her ?
ROSE: Yeah . Sort of . I tried to recruit her , gave her my card . She said she 'd think about it but I never heard from her .
BUTCH GIRL: Beautiful eyes .
EDDIE: Who came by looking for her ?
ROSE: He said he was her cousin . I told him where she works . They were just here .
EDDIE: Describe him .
ROSE: Tall , short-haired , scary eyes . Second guy with him wasshorter , with a wrestler 's build . And he would n't turn his videocamera off me .
EDDIE: He had a videocamera ? Where is she ? Quickly !
ROSE: She washes hair up at Ludwig 's - a salon on 63rd and Madison .
EDDIE: Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison . Hair salon . Ludwig 's .
JORDY: I 'm on my way with Eddie . Ludwig 's . 63rd and Madison . The suspects might be there already .
EDDIE: You thirsty ?
JORDY: I 'm on duty .
EDDIE: So am I. Alright , I 'll go inside and you cover the back .
JORDY: Of course .
EDDIE: Hey ! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid . I dreamed of running up to a door , kicking it in , pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze ! ' at the bad guy ! What 'd you dream about ?

DAPHNE: No , no , do n't talk to Immigration ! She clams up .
JORDY: Why not ?
EDDIE: Something back home ?
DAPHNE: my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was aping her . His gun was on the chair He came at me and I shot him .

DUFFY: Hey . Warsaw .
JORDY: Hey , Chief , what are you doing here ?
DUFFY: I came to see how the investigation was going . I called and you 're not here . I wait up at the station and you do n't even show up ! ! ! I beep you - you do n't return my call . Where the hell have you been ? ! Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne .
JORDY: Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training . We stopped there so she could get cleaned up .
DUFFY: What do you mean , 'cleaned up ? '
JORDY: I let her take a shower .
DUFFY: A shower ! ? Did you take one , too ?
JORDY: No ! Nothing happened .
DUFFY: Oh really . That 's nice . You took a homicide witness to take a shower afte your partner was shot ? Are you out of your fucking mind ? ? Are you having that much trouble gettin ' dates ? !
TOMMY: This way , ma'am .
EDDIE: There was too much press hangin ' around there . I did n't want her face on the news . So I told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down .
DUFFY: Oh .
EDDIE: It was my decision , not his .
DUFFY: Well , I 'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I 'd like to be included in decisions .
EDDIE: Look , after Jordy briefs me , you can do the press conference . How about that ? The case is all yours .
DUFFY: Oh yeah ? Alright .
EDDIE: I 'm ready to be briefed . Excuse us .
DUFFY: Yeah , sure . Beep me when you 're ready for the press conference .
JORDY: Will do , Chief .
EDDIE: Wait .
JORDY: Look , Eddie , I 'm tellin ' you - I did n't touch her .
EDDIE: Well , you shoulda because nobody 's gon na elieve you didn'tincluding me .
JORDY: I took her there for a shower and that 's it .
EDDIE: Just a shower ? Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look .
JORDY: Yeah , just her in the shower . Nothing happened . Look , I 'm sure you probably think I 'm a fool and I fucked up , but
EDDIE: No , I do n't think you were a fool , I just think you were stupid about it . I mean , to say the least , you outta know etter . You do n't know her well enough . She 's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her , it 's fuckin ' over . You can deny it all you want , but it will not make one fucking bit of difference . You 're dead .
JORDY: I told you , you know , I thought I was doing the right thing , you know , I think she 's innocent .
EDDIE: Well , it 's not up to you to decide whether she 's innocent or not . Do n't you understand , that 's why you 're a professional .
JORDY: But , I mean , did n't you ever go out on a limb for somebody ? I mean , you shoulda heard her there . Tellin ' her whole storyI believed her .
EDDIE: How you go out on a limb for somebody is y giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer . Here , here 's a number of an Immigration lawyer . That 's how you help her . But you ca n't get involved in her like that . You 're gon na jeopardize you career , your life and you 're gon na jeopardize my case . And lem me give you another piece of advice . Maybe you do n't watch TV but I 'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin ' world watches television . And when you get out there , they know your face . And the little fame , the little fuckin ' itty itty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job . And I get more done because of it . Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat .
JORDY: Why 'd you help me back there with the Chief ? Why 'd you stand up for me like that ?
EDDIE: You know , I do n't know . I like you . You remind me of a puppy I used to have . He pissed on the rug all the time , but I still kept him .

EDDIE: Then do it , asshole .
EMIL: Good - be tough to the end . Actor who plays you will want to die like hero .
EDDIE: If you kill me and film it you 're putting a noose around your neck . Emil turns to Oleg .
EMIL: Turn it off . Oleg obeys . Emil turns to Eddie .
OLEG: Good idea !
EDDIE: You really think you 'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit ? How fuckin ' stupid are you ?
EMIL: Smarter than Americans . You 're fed cry aby talk shows all day long . Not only will Americans believe me , they 'll cry for me . SoDetective Eddie Flemming , would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette ? Maybe you can propose to her now ?

DUFFY: How are you going to fight this ? Maybe if Oleg had n't gotten away and you 'd een on the front page , as a hero , this thing would be easier to fight . You 'd have the good to weight against the bad ! It 's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage ut there 's nothing I can do ! Gim me your shield .
JORDY: But Chief ? Over this ? ?
DUFFY: There 's nothing to talk about . Get a good lawyer . You 're suspended until your trial .
STERN: Look , what do n't you understand ? We 've got a good relationship with the Czech 's and the State Department does n't want to cause an incident .

STERN: They 've got her testimony on videotape . And even if they do take her to court immediately after she 'll be extradited . The Czechs want her back . She shot a cop ! I mean , Christ , man , what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic ? How would you feel if the Czechs would n't give them back to us ? !
JORDY: We 're gon na fight the extradition . Daphne takes Jordy 's bandaged hand in hers .

ED: Because she 's hot . But today 's not about me . It 's about you becoming the new regional sales manager .
MIKE: I better be . I 've invested 18 years of my life in that miserable company .
ED: No negativity . Negativity 's fo the 800 pound fat lady who needs to e airlifted out of bed . You , Michael Shawn O'Donnell , are a winner .
MIKE: A winner does n't have to crash at his best friend 's house because he was kicked out of his own house .

ROGER: Look , your sales are admittedly etter but she has the college degree . What can I do ?
MIKE: You can give me the promotion , Roger !
ROGER: Things have changed . I could n't even hire you now with only a high school diploma . My hands are tied , o-ski .

JANITOR: ` For of all sad words of tongue and pen , the saddest are these ` It might have been '
MIKE: That 'll be my epitaph .
JANITOR: We all have regrets .
MIKE: Why 's it have to be that way ?
JANITOR: Maybe it does , maybe it does n't . Ca n't hurt to ask . You never know who 's listening , Michael .
MIKE: How did you know
ALEX: Why are you limping ?
MIKE: Tweaked my back pumping iron . Really , really heavy iron .
ALEX: Yeah , me and the guys are running drills , scrimmaging , getting in shape .
MIKE: That 's my boy . Remember , it 's not how big you are-
ALEX: -it 's how big you play .
MIKE: And what about you , Mags ? What 's new ?
MAGGIE: Nothing .
ALEX: She got into Georgetown .
MIKE: You did ! ? That 's fantastic !
MAGGIE: It 's no big deal .
MIKE: It 's a huge deal . That 's a great university . I 'm proud of you . Am I missing something here ?
MAGGIE: You would n't understand .
MIKE: Try me .
MAGGIE: I have a lot of emotional stress ight now . My friends are all going to different schools , I 'm not even sure
MIKE: That 's not stress . Wait ` til you get out into the real world , get a crappy job , have some smarmy twerp- oss calling you bro-ski
ALEX: Did you get the promotion , Dad ?
MIKE: Still waiting to hear .
ALEX: She 's probably out back .
MIKE: Hey , next week we 'll have a arbecue at Uncle Ed 's . Sound good ?
MAGGIE: I 'm counting down the minutes .
MIKE: What 's with her ?
ALEX: We see you once a week for a couple hours . What do you expect ?
DOM: Hey , Mike . Good to see you . Tough eak , you and Scarlet .
MIKE: Bite me , Dom .
SCARLET: Dom was in the neighborhood . He offered to make a dump run for me .
MIKE: Does n't he live 30 miles from here ?
SCARLET: What 's your point ?
MIKE: Come on . He 's been after you since 10th grade and he 's after you now .
SCARLET: At least someone 's after me .
MIKE: ` In touch with the ground , I 'm on the hunt I 'm after you . '
SCARLET: Please , Mike . This is n't high school . That 's not gon na work .
MIKE: ` Smell like I sound , I 'm lost in a crowd , and I 'm hungry like the wolf . '
SCARLET: You can stop now . It 's not working .
MIKE: ` Mouth is alive , with juices like wine , and I 'm hungry like the wolf '
SCARLET: You no longer have the right to invoke the `` wolf . ''
MIKE: Why are you destroying the yard ?
SCARLET: I 'm gon na use it as a showpiece fo clients . Thanks for asking .
MIKE: Kind of a big undertaking is n't it ?
SCARLET: I am a landscape designer . Then again you barely took an interest in my work so I guess that 's a fai question .
MIKE: I did n't get it .
SCARLET: I 'm sorry . But maybe this is what you needed . Maybe it 's time you looked for something else ?
MIKE: That 's a great idea , Scar . Because there are so many options out there for a 36 year old with only a high school diploma .
SCARLET: And it 's all my fault , is n't it ?
MIKE: I did n't say that .
SCARLET: No , but it 's what you think , right ?
MIKE: But I did .
SCARLET: I 'm sorry you 're not happy with the way your life turned out Mike , eally , I am , but you 're not the victim here .
MIKE: Jesus !
ED: Coming ! I 've been worried sick !
MIKE: I 've had a really rough night .
ED: AAAAAHHHHHHHHH ! ! ! ! !
MIKE: What are you gon na do ? Exfoliate me to death ? You got into my samples case again , did n't you ?
ED: Maria , we 're just friends . Really .
MIKE: Well , it obviously is n't working .
ED: That 's because the cocktail 's not complete .
MIKE: Is that true ?
ED: It was pretty bad .
MIKE: Wait ! ! Wait ! ! Wait ! ! Do you eally think this 'll work ?
ED: It could .
MIKE: The janitor !
JANITOR: I 'm the only custodial enginee currently employed here .
MIKE: There was an old guy , white hair . I showed him this picture of me-
JANITOR: -Of you ? That picture 's from 1989 .
MIKE: Right . Forget it .
ALEX: I wanted to see if I could get my nuts into my esophagus . What do you think I 'm doing ! ? Get me down !
MIKE: Okay . Okay . I 'll get you down .
ALEX: How do you know my name ?
MIKE: I'mMarkFreedman . Your Uncle Ed 's son . He told me to look out for you .
ALEX: Uncle Ed has a son ?
MIKE: Believe me , it 's gon na be a surprise to him too . Did those guys do this to you ?
ALEX: Goons from the basketball team .
MIKE: But why ?
ALEX: Because they can and so they do on a daily basis .
MIKE: But you 're one of them .
ALEX: No , I 'm not . Nice robe , guy . Got ta go .
ED: Did you find the janitor ?
MIKE: He does n't exist . Nothing makes sense .
ED: Did he ask you for your soul ?
MIKE: No ?
ED: That 's a good sign . We can eliminate Satan . I think what we 're dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment . `` Spell affect '' '' casting procedure '' yada , yada , yada . Basically it 's a learning spell . There 's something you need to figure out and until you do you 'll stay a kid . My guess is that janitor was probably a war
MIKE: I 'm going back to high school .
ED: lock . I 'm sorry . Could you epeat that ? Because I thought you just said you were-
MIKE: Going back to high school .
ED: Are you out of your freaking mind ! ?
MIKE: My son was hanging by his underwea from a bathroom stall door and my daughter was being mauled by a smarmy gorilla . They need me .
ED: What about your job ?
MIKE: Email and telephone . I got it covered .
ED: Well , Scarlet , then . What are you gon na tell her ?
MIKE: Nothing .
ED: You 're just gon na disappear ?
MIKE: To be honest , I think she 'd rathe have it that way . What 's with the attitude ?
ED: Because I know you 're going to suck me into this and I 'm not going back there , Mike . You 'll never get me to go back to Fitch . Never !
MIKE: Take a deep breath . All you have to do is enroll me and say as little as possible .
ED: Please . I created software used to launch the space shuttle . I think I 'm capable of forging some report cards . What 's up with the gear ?
MIKE: This is hip teenage apparel . I got it right off the mannequin at Ed Hardy .

ED: I 'll enroll him somewhere else .
JULIE: I really need to get back to work .

MAGGIE: Georgetown .
MR. ADAMS: If you flunk senior calculus you 'll e lucky to get into beauty school , missy . So , if you plan on slacking your way through my class , do n't . Save your parents tuition money and pick up a blow dryer
MIKE: Enough !
MR. ADAMS: Excuse me ?
MIKE: Do you think humiliating a 17 year- old in front of her peers is helpful or do you just get off on it ?
MR. ADAMS: And you are ?
MIKE: Mark Freedman . It 's my first day .
MR. ADAMS: Well , Mr. Freedman-
MIKE: Is someone barbecuing ?
MR. ADAMS: Get out , Mr. Freedman !

BARTENDER: Funny , kid .

MIKE: I 'm not going back there .
ED: Mike , you 're an adult sitting on 36 years of experience . You should be dominating these kids , ripping their hearts out .
MIKE: I know why you 're encouraging me all of a sudden .
ED: Because I 'm a supportive dad .
MIKE: Because you want to nail my principal .
ED: Did she ask about me ?
MIKE: She 's not your type . She 's smart .
ED: As far as I can tell that 's he only flaw . I need a reason to see her again . You could flunk you classes , start a fight , vandalise the place . You 'll figure it out . Then I can rush in , a teary eyed , helpless , single dad who ca n't handle his angry , kitten killing son . What do you think ?
OLDER LADY: I think you should be reported to child services !
ED: Mind your business , Lady . This is a family matter .
MIKE: I ca n't do it . I do n't have it in me .
ED: Hey , no sweat off my sack . Tell Alex to stop wearing underwear all together . He 'll be fine . That 's what I did .
MIKE: You 're right ! My kids need me .
ED: At ' a boy . Now what you need is a crash course on being a teen in
MIKE: There must be a very hot girl downstairs .
ED: There is . What are you doing ?
MIKE: I forwarded my calls to my new phone , sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet , told her I was in Peru finding myself . Think she 'll buy it ?

MIKE: So I 've been here a couple days now and I think I got it figured out . You girls are lesbians , right ?
ALEX: Mark ? You look totally different .
MIKE: I got rid of the bull 's eye on my forehead .
ALEX: Could you move to the left a little ?
MIKE: Who 's she ?
ALEX: Nicole Lopez . She 's in my Spanish class .
MIKE: Have you spoken to her ?

MIKE: There , there now . It 's okay .
MAGGIE: Sure he was a jerk but he was there for me . Which is more than I can say for any other man in my life .
MIKE: When you 're young everything seems like the end of the world . But it 's not . It 's just the beginning . And you might have to meet a few more jerks , but one day you 'll meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treatedlike the sun rises and sets with you .

MIKE: Do n't you lay a finger on her , Johnson ! I know where you live !
ALEX: It 's weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad .
MIKE: It 's adultery ! If this were Afghanistan she 'd be dragged through the village by goats . You need to talk to her .
ALEX: My mom 's been pretty sad the past few months . She deserves to be happy . My dad obviously iswherever he is .
MIKE: Maybe he 's not ? Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you ut there 's a real good reason he ca n't be .
ALEX: No , my dad 's not a family guy . This is dumb but I used to tell him I was on the basketball team because I knew he 'd never make it to a game .
MIKE: Then why would you tell him that ?

MIKE: On second thought-
HOSTESS: There you are , Mr. Freedman .
ED: Thanks . Put this towards you studies .
JULIE: When you asked me to get togethe to talk about Mark this is n't what I envisioned . This is n't a date , Ed .

WAITER: Good evening . Would you care to see the wine-
ED: Bring us the 1962 Petrus .
JULIE: I do n't drink . So tell me what you think 's going on with Mark ?

JULIE: You did n't ask me here to talk about Mark , did you ?
ED: Do you like caviar ? Because if you do you have to try the Almas . 100 year-old Beluga . $ 700 per ounce .
JULIE: You 're disgusting , Ed .
ED: What ? You do n't like Beluga ? You can get something else .
JULIE: I 'm not some 22 year-old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine .
ED: Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo ?
JULIE: I came here because I 'm concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you do n't care about Mark . All you 're concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are .

MIKE: Slow down . Have you ever kissed a girl before ?
ALEX: Not a real one . I used to practice on my dad 's Playboys .
MIKE: How did you findforget it . It 's easy . All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like

SCARLET: I 'm not so sure . I mean look at me . I showed up at a party to drag my son home . Could I be any more embarrassing ? And how many amazing mothers run their kids ' father off ?
MIKE: Hey , you did n't run him off . Do n't lame yourself for his stupidity .

You whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and I felt so peaceful and safe because I knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that ad because I had you . And then I grew up , lost my way and blamed you for my failures . But I was neve lost . I 'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older . And I never failed at anything because on that Septembe day you said ` yes ' to me . And at that dance you said you loved me .

B13: CONTINUED PASSPORT GIRL Thank you . Despite and excellent and continually improving safety record there are certain risks inherent in space travel and an extremely high cost of pay load . Because of this it is necessary for the Space Carrie to advise you that it can not be esponsible for the return of you ody to Earth should you become deceased on the Moon or en route to the Moon . However , it wishes to advise you that insurance covering this contingency is available in the Main Lounge . Thank you . You are cleared through Voice Print Identification .
MILLER: I 've reserved a table for you in the Earth Light room . You connecting flight will be leaving in about one hour . 12/7/65 b15

FLOYD: Yes , I think so . Just about then .
MILLER: I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking .
FLOYD: Yes , it 's coming along very well .
FLOYD: Oh , look , I 've got to make a phone call . Why do n't you go on into the Restaurant and I 'll meet you in there . 12/7/65 b17

B20: SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
FLOYD: Well , how nice to see you again , Elena . You 're looking wonderful .
ELENA: How nice to see you , Hyewood . This is my good friend , Dr. Heywood Floyd . I 'd like you to meet Andre Smyslov
SMYSLOV: Dr. Floyd , wo n't you join us for a drink ? 12/7/65 b28
B20: CONTINUED
FLOYD: I 'm afraid I 've only got a few minutes , but I 'd love to .
FOR ANOTHER: PERSON AT THE TABLE . SMYSLOV OFFERS FLOYD HIS CHAIR AND BORROWS ANOTHER FROM A NEARBY TABLE
SYMYSLOV: What would you like to drink ?
FLOYD: Oh , I really do n't have time for a drink . If it 's all right I 'll just sit for a minute and then I 've got to be off .
SMYSLOV: Are you quite sure ?
FLOYD: Yes , really , thank you very much .
ELENA: Well How 's your lovely wife ? 12/7/65 b29
B20: CONTINUED
FLOYD: She 's wonderful .
ELENA: And your charming little daughter ?
FLOYD: Oh , she 's growing up very fast . As a matter of fact , she 's six tomorrow .
ELENA: Oh , that 's such a delightful age .
FLOYD: How is gregor ?
ELENA: He 's fine . But I 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days .
FLOYD: Well , where are all of you off to ? 12/7/65 b30
B20: CONTINUED
ELENA: Actually , we 're on our way back from the moon . We 've just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko . And what about you ?
FLOYD: Well , as it happens , I 'm on my way up to the moon
SMYSLOV: Are you , by any chance , going up to your base at Clavius ?
FLOYD: Yes , as a matter of fact , I am .
THE RUSSIANS: EXCHANGE SIGNIFICANT GLANCES
FLOYD: Is there any particular reason why you ask ? 12/7/65 b31
B20: CONTINUED
SMYSLOV: Well , Dr. Floyd , I hope that you do n't think I 'm too inquisitive , but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about what 's been going on up there .
FLOYD: I 'm sorry , but I 'm not sure I know what you mean .
SMYSLOV: Well , it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius .
FLOYD: Really ?
SMYSLOV: Yes . Well , for one thing , whenever you phone the base , all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order . 12/7/65 b32
B20: CONTINUED
FLOYD: Well , I suppose they 've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment .
SMYSLOV: Yes , well at first we thought that was the explanation , but it 's been going on for the past ten days .
FLOYD: You mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
SMYSLOV: That 's right .
FLOYD: I see .
ELENA: Another thing , Heywood , two days ago , one of our rocket uses was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius . 12/7/65 b33
B20: CONTINUED
FLOYD: How did they manage to do that without any communication ?
ELENA: Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal .
FLOYD: Well , that does sound very odd .
SMYSLOV: Yes , and I 'm afaid there 's going to be a bit of a row about it . Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S . convention .
FLOYD: Yes Well , I hope the crew got back safely .
SMYSLOV: Fortunately , they did .
FLOYD: Well , I 'm glad about that . 12/7/65 b33a
B20: CONTINUED
SMYSLOV: Dr. Floyd , at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss , may I ask you a straightforward question ?
FLOYD: Certainly .
SMYSLOV: Quite frankly , we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius . Something , apperently , of an unknown origin . Is this , in fact , what has happened ?
B20: CONTINUED
FLOYD: I 'm sorry , Dr. Smyslov , but I 'm really not at liberty to discuss this .
SMYSLOV: This epidemic could easily spread to our base , Dr. Floyd . We should be given all the facts .
FLOYD: Dr. Smyslov I 'm not permitted to discuss this .
ELENA: Are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink ?
FLOYD: No , thank you and I 'm afraid now I really must be going .
ELENA: Well , I hope that you and you wife can come to the I.A.C . conference in June . 12/7/65 b33c
B20: CONTINUED
FLOYD: We 're trying to get there . I hope we can .
ELENA: Well , Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you .
FLOYD: Thank you . It 's been a great pleasure to meet all of you Dr. Smyslov .
NARRATOR: The Aries-IB has become the standard Space-Station-to-Luna surface vehicle . It was powered y low-thrust plasma jets which would continue the mild acceler- ation for fifteen minutes . Then the ship would break the bonds of gravity and be a free and indepen- dent planet , circling the Sun in an orbit of its own . 10/4/65 b34
STEWARDESS ONE: Oh , thank you very much .
STEWARDESS TWO: I see he 's still asleep .

PILOT: Oh , thank you very much .
STEWARDESS: Fine . Very quiet . He 's been asleep since we left .
PILOT: Well , no one can say that he 's not enjoying the wonders of Space .
B22: CONTINUED
PILOT: I wonder what really IS going on up there ?
B22: CONTINUED
PILOT: Well , as soon as he wakes up , I 'm going to go back and talk to him . I must say , I 'd like to find out what 's going on . 12/14/65 b36a
B23: ARIES-IB IN SPACE . MOON VERY LARGE .
B24: ARIES-IB PASSENGER AREA . FLOYD FINISHING BREAKFAST .
PILOT: Well , good afternoon , Dr. Floyd . Did you have a good rest ?
FLOYD: Oh , marvellous . It 's the first eal sleep I 've had for the past two days .
PILOT: There 's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest .
FLOYD: When do we arrive at Clavius ?
PILOT: We 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . Is there anything we can do for you ?
FLOYD: Oh , no , thank you . The two girls have taken wonderful care of me . I 'm just fine . 12/14/65 b38
B24: CONTINUED
PILOT: Well , if there is anything that you wnat , just give a holler .
FLOYD: Thank you .
PILOT: Incidentally , Dr. Floyd , I wonde if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
FLOYD: What do you mean ?
PILOT: Well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius . We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours . And then we 're going to back empty .
FLOYD: I see .
PILOT: I take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at Clavius ? 12/14/65 b39
B24: CONTINUED
FLOYD: I 'm afraid that 's out of my depart- ment , Captain .
PILOT: Well , I 'll tell you why I ask . You see , I 've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I have n't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so , and with all these stories one hears , I 'm a little concerned about her .
FLOYD: I see . Well , I 'm sorry about that . I would n't think there 's any cause for alarm .
PILOT: Yes , well , I would n't have been too concerned about it , except I 've heard these stories about the epidemic and , as a matter of fact , I 've heard that ten people have died already . 12/14/65 b40
B24: CONTINUED
FLOYD: I wish I could be more helpful , Captain , but as I 've said , I do n't think there 's any cause fo alarm .
PILOT: Well , fine . Thanks very much , anyway , and I hope you do n't mind me asking ?
FLOYD: No , of course , Captain , I can understand your concern .
PILOT: Well , thank you very much , and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make you trip more comfortable . 12/14/65 b40a
B25: ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON

B27: ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON
B28: FLOYD VISITING ARIES-IB COCKPIT . WEIGHTLESS TRICK ENTRANCE .
B29: ARIES-IB ORBITING MOON .
NARRATOR: The laws of Earthly aesthetics did not apply here , this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces , operating ove aeons of time unknown to the young , verdant Earth , with its fleeting Ice-Ages , its swiftly rising and falling seas , its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn . Here was age inconceivable - but not death , for the Moon had never lived until now . 10/4/65 b45
B30: ARIES-IB COCKPIT - THE CREW AND DOCKING CONTROL PEOPLE ON THE MOON GO THROUGH THEIR DOCKING ROUTINE . THIS HAS THE RITUALISTIC TONE AND CADENCE OF PRESENT- DAY JET LANDING PROCEDURE . WE ONLY HEAR DOCKING CONTROL .
B31: ARIES-IB DECENDING . SEE AIR VIEW OF BASE .
NARRATOR: The Base at Clavius was the first American Lunar Settlement that could , in an emergency , be entirely self-supporting .

B35: LOW GRAVITY GYMNASIUM TRICK WITH CHILDREN .
NARRATOR: One of the attractions of life on the Moon was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general well-being . 10/4/65 b51
B36: CHILDREN IN SCHOOL . TEACHER SHOWING THEM VIEWS OF EARTH AND MAP OF EARTH .
NARRATOR: The personnel of the Base and thei children were the forerunners of new nations , new cultures that would ultimately spread out across the solar system . They no longe thought of Earth as home . The time was fast approaching when Earth , like all mothers , must say farewell to her children .
B37: LARGE CENTRAL RECEPTION AREA . DOORS BRANCHING OFF TO DIFF- RENT MAIN HALLS . SMALL POND WITH PLASTIC WHITE SWAN AND A BIT OF GRASS . A FEW BENCHES WITH THREE WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN HAVING OUTING .
HALVERSON, MICHAELS: AND FIVE OTHERS .
FLOYD: I must congratulate you Halvorsen . you 've done wonder- ful things with the decor since the last time I was here .
HALVORSEN: Well thank you , Dr. Floyd . We try to make the environment as earthlike as possible .
B38: LOW CEILING CONFERENCE ROOM , `` U '' SHAPED TABLE FACING THREE PROJECTION SCREENS . SEATED AROUND THE TABLE ARE TWENTY SENIOR BASE PERSONNEL .
HALVORSEN: Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd , a distinguished membe of the National Council of Astronautics . He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us , and efore the briefing he would like to say a few words . Dr. Floyd .
FLOYD: First of all , I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell , who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made , and of course his congratulations on you discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science .
B38: CONTINUED
FLOYD: This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council ecommending when and how the news should eventually be announced . Are there any questions ?
MICHAELS: Dr. Floyd , how long do you think this can be kept under wraps ?
FLOYD: I 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council . And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to e obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event . There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement . 11/25/65 b56
B38: CONTINUED
HALVORSEN: We will , of course , cooperate in any way possible , Dr. Floyd . 11/25/65 b56a
B39: SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OF MOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMING OVER SURFACE OF MOON .
B40: INSIDE ROCKET BUS , FLOYD , HALVORSEN , MICHAELS , FOURTH MAN , PILOT AND CO-PILOT . ALL IN SPACE SUITS MINUS HELMETS .
LOOKING THROUGH: SOME PHOTOGRAPHS AND MAGNETIC MAPS OF THE AREA .
THE WINDOW,: THOUGHTFULLY .
B40: CONTINUED
THE PHOTOGRAPHES: ARE TAKEN FROM A SATELLITE OF THE MOON 'S SURFACE AND HAVE NUMBERED OPTICAL GRID BORDERS , LIKE RECENT MARS PHOTOS .
AWAY, MICHAELS: AND HALVORSEN CARRY OUT A VERY BANAL ADMINISTRATIVE CONVERSATION IN LOW TONES . IT SHOULD REVOLVE AROUND SOMETHING UTTERLY IRRELEVANT TO THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND VERY MUCH LIKE THE KIND OF DISCUSSION ONE HEARS ALL THE TIME IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS .
B41: TMA-1 EXCAVATION . AIR VIEW . ROCKET BUS DESCENDING .
B42: LONG SHOT MONITOR DOMES WITH A BIT OF EXCAVATION IN SHOT . SIX SMALL FIGURES IN SPACE SUITS SLOWLY WALK TOWARD EXCAVATION .
B43: THE PARTY STOPS AT TOP OF TMA-1 EXCAVATION .
RAMP. MICHAELS: THROWS A SWITCH AND THE EXCAVATION IS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATED .
HALVORSEN: Well , there it is .
FLOYD: Can we go down there closer to it ?
HALVORSEN: Certainly . 12/14/65 b62
B44: THEY START DOWN WORKING RAMP
FLOYD: Does your geology on it still check out ?
MICHAELS: Yes , it does . The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about fou million years ago .
FLOYD: How can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
MICHAELS: By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill .
FLOYD: Any clue as to what it is ?
MICHAELS: Not really . It 's completely inert . No sound or energy sources have been detected . The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we 've been barely able to scratch it . A laser drill 11/25/65 b63
B44: CONTINUED
MICHAELS: might do something , but we do n't want to be too rough until we know a little more .
FLOYD: But you do n't have any idea as to what it is ?
MICHAELS: Tomb , shine , survey-marke spare part , take your choice .
HALVORSEN: The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth .
HALVORSEN: Four million years ago , something , presumably from the stars , must have swept through the sola system and left this behind . 11/25/65 b64
B44: CONTINUED
FLOYD: Was it abandoned , forgotten , left for a purpose ?
HALVORSEN: I suppose we 'll never know .
MICHAELS: The moon would have made an excellent base camp fo preliminary Earth surveys .
FLOYD: Any ideas about the colour ?
MICHAELS: Well , not really . At first glance , lack would suggest something sun-powered , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device ?
FLOYD: Has it been exposed to any sun efore now ?
MICHAELS: I do n't think it has , but I 'd like to check that . Simpson , what 's the log on that ? 11/25/65 b65
B45: INSIDE MONITOR DOME WE SEE A NUMBER OF TELEVISION DISPLAYS INCLUDING SEVERAL TV VIEWS OF FLOYD AND COMPANY IN THE EXCAVATION .
SIMPSON: The first surface was exposed at 0843 on the 12th April Let me see that would have been forty-five minutes after Luna sun-set . I see here that special lighting equipment had to be brought up before any futher work could be done . 11/25/65 b66
B46: TMA-1 EXCAVATION
MICHAELS: Thank you .
FLOYD: And so this is the first sun that it 's had in four million years .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Excuse me , gentlemen , if you 'd all line up on this side of the walkway we 'd like to take a few photographes . Dr. Floyd , would you thand in the middle Dr. Michaels on that side , Mr. Halvorsen on the other . thank you .
THE PHOTOGRAPHER: QUICKLY MAKES SOME EXPOSURES
PHOTOGRAPHER: Thank you very much gentlemen , I 'll have the base photo section send you copies .
B47: VARIOUS SHOTS OF SPACE MONITORS , ASTEROIDS , THE SUN , PLUTO , MARS .
NARRATOR: A hundred million miles beyond Mars , in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled , Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids .
B47: CONTINUED
NARRATOR: But now it had noted something strange - the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system , and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past .

C12: POOLE IS FINISHED .
READING AND: WORKING ON HIS DESSERT .
POOLE: Dave , if you 've a minute , I 'd like your advice on something .
BOWMAN: Sure , what is it ?
POOLE: Well , it 's nothing really important , ut it 's annoying .
BOWMAN: What 's up ?
POOLE: It 's about my salary cheques .
BOWMAN: Yes ?
POOLE: Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left . 12/14/65 c12
C12: CONTINUED
BOWMAN: Yes , I remember you mentioning it . I got mine about the same time .
POOLE: That 's right . Well , naturally , I did n't say anything to Payroll . I assumed they 'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque . But it 's been almost three weeks now and I 'm still eing paid as an AGS-18 .
BOWMAN: Interesting that you mention it , ecause I 've got the same problem .
POOLE: Really .
BOWMAN: Yes .
POOLE: Yesterday , I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control , and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine , and apparently not yours either . 12/14/65 c13
C12: CONTINUED
BOWMAN: Did they have any explanation fo this ?
POOLE: Not really . They just said it might e because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall , and that we 're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices .
BOWMAN: It 's possible .
POOLE: Well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
BOWMAN: I do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . I 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .
POOLE: I must say , I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
BOWMAN: No . I never did , either . 12/14/65 c14
C12: CONTINUED
POOLE: We spent so little time with them , I have trouble keeping their names straight .
BOWMAN: I suppose the idea was specialized training .
POOLE: I suppose so . Though , of course , there 's a more sinister explanation .
BOWMAN: Oh ?
POOLE: Yes . You must have heard the umour that went around during orbital check-out .
BOWMAN: No , as a matter of fact , I did n't .
POOLE: Oh , well , apparently there 's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we do n't know , and that 's why we were trained separately and that 's why they were put to sleep efore they were even taken aboard . 12/14/65 c15
C12: CONTINUED
BOWMAN: Well , what is it ?
POOLE: I do n't know . All I heard is that there 's something about the mission we were n't told .
BOWMAN: That seems very unlikely .
POOLE: Yes , I thought so .
BOWMAN: Of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .
POOLE: How ?
BOWMAN: Just ask Hal . It 's conceivable they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from Hal .
POOLE: That 's true . 12/14/65 c15a
C12: CONINUED
BOWMAN: Well it 's silly , but if you want to , why do n't you ?
POOLE: Hal Dave and I believe that there 's something about the mission that we were n't told . Something that the rest of the crew know and that you know . We 'd like to know whether this is true .
HAL: I 'm sorry , Frank , but I do n't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .
BOWMAN: He 's got a point .
POOLE: Okay , then how do we re-phrase the question ? 12/14/65 c15c
C12: CONTINUED
BOWMAN: Still , you really do n't believe it , do you ?
POOLE: Not really . Though , it is strange when you think about it . It did n't eally make any sense to keep us apart during training .
BOWMAN: Yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us .
POOLE: I know . It would be almost inconceivable .
BOWMAN: But not completely inconceivable ?
POOLE: I suppose it is n't logically impossible .
BOWMAN: I guess it is n't .
POOLE: Still , all we have to do is ask Hal . 12/14/65 c15
C12: CONTINUED
BOWMAN: Well , the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going , what will we do when we get there , when are we coming ack , and why are we going ?
POOLE: Right . Hal , tell me whether the following statements are true o false .
HAL: I will if I can , Frank .
POOLE: Our Mission Profile calls fo Discovery going to Saturn . True or false ?
HAL: True .
POOLE: Our transit time is 257 days . Is that true ?
HAL: That 's true . 12/14/65 c15d
C12: CONTINUED
POOLE: At the end of a hundred days of exploration , we will all go into hibernation . Is this true ?
HAL: That 's true .
POOLE: Approximately five years after we go into hibernation , the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back . Is this true ?
HAL: That 's true
POOLE: There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program , and to further our general knowledge of the planets . Is that true ?
HAL: That 's true .
POOLE: Thank you very much , Hal . 12/14/65 c15e

MISSION CONTROL: I would n't worry too much about the computer . First of all , there is still a chance that he is right , despite your tests , and if it should happen again , we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails . If the computer should turn out to be wrong , the situation is still not alarming . The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers . It has almost always revolved around a single detail , such as the one you have described , and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer 's performance in other areas . No one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning . It may be over-programming , 12/1/65 c77

BOWMAN: You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition ?
HAL: Yes , I know .
BOWMAN: You probably also know that we found them okay .
HAL: Yes , I know that . But I can assure you that they were about to fail . 12/14/65 c80

BOWMAN: Well , that 's just not the case , Hal . They are perfectly all right . We tested them under one hundred pe cent overload .
HAL: I 'm not questioning your word , Dave , ut it 's just not possible . I 'm not capable of being wrong .
BOWMAN: Hal , is there anything bothering you ? Anything that might account for this problem ?
HAL: Look , Dave , I know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units , and with your test gear .
BOWMAN: Okay , Hal , well let 's see the way things go from here on . 12/14/65 c81

As you suggested , we are going to wait and see if it fails , but we are quite sure there is nothing wrong with the unit . If a reasonable waiting period proves us to be correct , we feel now that the compute eliability has been seriously impaired , and presents an unacceptable risk pattern to the mission . We believe , under these circumstances , it would be advisable to disconnect the computer from all ship operations and continue the mission under Earth-based computer control . 12/1/65 c85

HAL: I 'm sorry , Dave , but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4 , quote , When the crew are dead or incapacitated , the computer must assume control , unquote . I must , therefore , override you authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it .

C148: CUT TO SIMONSON

POOLE'S VOICE: The purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets . Is this true ?
HAL'S VOICE: That is true .
SIMONSON: Well , I 'm afaid Hal was lying . He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur- ity reasons which we 'll explain later . The true purpose of the Mission was to have been explained to you y Mission Commander Kaminsky , on his revival . Hal knew this and he knew the actual mission , but he could n't tell you the truth when you challenged him . Under orders 12/13/65 c120

C149: CONTINUED
C150: FLOYD 'S RECORDED BRIEFING
FLOYD: Good day , gentlemen . When you see this briefing , I presume you will be nearing your destination , Saturn . I hope that you 've had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner . I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you . Thirteen months before the launch date of your Saturn mission , on April 12th , 2001 , the first evidence for intelligent life outside the Earth was discovered . It was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater Tycho . No news of this was ever announced , and the event had been kept secret since then , for reasons which I will later explain . Soon after it was uncovered , it emitted a powerful blast of 12/13/65 c124
C150: CONTINUED
FLOYD: What is its purpose ? I wish we knew . The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago , when our ancestors were primative man-apes . We 've examined dozens of theories , ut the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm . What the purpose of the alarm is , why they wish to have the alarm , whether the alarm represents any danger to us ? These are questions no one can answer . The intentions of an alien world , at least four million years olde than we are , can not be reliably predicted . In view of this , the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation . Discussion took place at the highest levels between govern- 12/14/65 c126

WORLDS. THE: NARRATION WILL SUGGEST IMAGES AND SITUATIONS AS YOU READ IT .
D1: CONTINUED NARRATOR Those who had begun the expri- ment so long ago had not been men . But when they looked out across the deeps of space , they felt awe and wonder - and loneliness . In their explorations , they encountered life in many forms , and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution . They saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night . And because , in all the galaxy , they had found nothing more precious than Mind , they encouraged its dawning every- where . The great Dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system , afte a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years . 12/9/65 d2
NARRATOR: For a few thousand years , they shared their Universe with thei machine children ; then , realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done , they passed into history without regret . Not one of them ever looked through his own eyes upon the planet Earth again . But even the age of the Machine Entities passed swiftly . In thei ceaseless experimenting , they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself , and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light . They could become creatures of radiation , free at last from the tyranny of matter . Now , they were Lords of the galaxy , and beyond the reach of time . They could rove at will among the stars , and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space . 12/9/65 d5

CAPTAIN MICHAELS: We have n't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted .
YURI: What do mean we ca n't board Number 4 ? I want to speak to your supervisor .
SOLDIER: I am the supervisor ! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements .
YURI: I want your name !

BADGE: Can you read ? Now get the hell back with the other green cards , or I 'll have you detained .
JACKSON: Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart . You 're doing great .
TAMARA: I should have listened to you , Dr. Silberman . I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it .
GORDON: Did you know he asked for a discount and he paid in installments ?
TAMARA: Cheap bastard .
GORDON: You 're better off without him . What he said about you and Sasha , is it true ?
TAMARA: Now that he 's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri .
JACKSON: You guys hear that ?
LAURA: Captain Michaels ? What happens to all those people ?
ANHEUSER: Dr. Wilson , there 's a protocol for all that . You just stick to your art . We 'll handle the rest .
ADRIAN: Satnam ?
CONFUSED: Where are you ?
ADRIAN: What ? !
SATNAM: There 's a tidal wave coming from the East ! It 's huge !
ADRIAN: Satnam , what happened ?
SATNAM: I have to go !
ADRIAN: Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam , India ?
SCIENCE OFFICER: One moment , sir .
ANHEUSER: Helmsley , what 's going on here ?
ADRIAN: Looks like our model was wrong .
PROF. WEST: Jesus !
ANHEUSER: What does this mean ?
ADRIAN: The flooding will happen earlier . Bobby , can you plug in the new data please ?
ANHEUSER: Talk to me Helmsley . What does this mean for us ?
ADRIAN: Bobby , plug in the new data and adjust the count down ?
ANHEUSER: Get me the other Heads of State .
LIN: Who are they ?
NENG: We found them by the side of the road , my brother .
LIN: You must send them back .
NENG: I am a follower of the great Lama Yak La . You know I can not do that .
JACKSON: Come with daddy .
LIN: Why should I do that ?
JACKSON: For the same reason you sent for you parents .
KATE: I have no clue if you understand what I 'm saying , but I ask you as a mother , please take my kids with you !
MRS. PANG: We are all children of this earth .
LIN: My plan will not work for so many , mother .
MRS. PANG: We will take them all . Bata ?
KATE: Thank you ma'am . Thank you so much .
YURI: They 're leaving without us !
SOLDIER: What did I tell you !
YURI: Look ! Idiot ! They are leaving you ehind too !
LIN: We have to hurry ! They launch ! We run out of time !
COMPUTER VOICE: Countdown to departure . Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds .

LAURA: What in god 's name is happening Adrian ?
ADRIAN: Anheuser convinced them all to launch .
ANHEUSER: What do you think you 're doing ?
ADRIAN: I know exactly what I 'm doing . Turn it on !
GERMAN CHANCELLOR: Can you please turn up the volume , Mr. Hoffmann ?
ADRIAN: But to be human means to care fo each other , and civilization means to work together to create a better life . If that 's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we 're doing here . Ask yourselves Can we eally stand by and let all those people out there die ?
PAUSE: Or at least I do n't want to be part of it .
ANHEUSER: We 'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we 'll get by . Officer switch that off .
ADRIAN: Do n't do it !
ANHEUSER: Have you lost your mind ? Look at the countdown . We have less than five minutes left And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people . If you save them today we all starve tomorrow .
ADRIAN: There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here , trying to give mankind a second chance . He 's the one who discovered it all , the one who connected the dots . We all owe him our lives .
PAUSE: I beg you whatever our future holds do n't let us start it with an act of cruelty . What will you tell you children and their children ?
LAURA: If my father were here , he would open the gates .
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: China and Japan agree to open the gates .

JACKSON: Noah ! Watch out !
KATE: No !
NOAH: Something happened , mom .
JACKSON: We have to stop it !
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: What 's wrong with the gate ?
OFFICER: I do n't know . Maybe there 's something jamming it , sir .
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER: Sir , we have a breach in the zoological ay .
ADRIAN: Can you zoom in ?
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: We 're loaded . We can close the gates sir .
ANHEUSER: Do it !
YURI: Pull yourself up !
YURI: Oleg ! Catch your brother !
DECK OFFICER: Boys , you got ta move .
ALEC: We wait for our father ! He 's still down there !
DECK OFFICER: There 's no one down there .
GENTLE: Come on boys , come
ANHEUSER: Why is the stern gate not closing ?
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: Something 's wrong with the hydraulics , sir .
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER: They must have come through the hydraulic chamber . There
LAURA: That guy is injured . Something must have gone wrong .
ANHEUSER: You 're damn right something went wrong ! Congratulations Helmsley , you may have just killed us all but as long as you conscience is clean
ADRIAN: Let 's get an emergency crew there right now . I 'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber .
ANHEUSER: You think you 're the main man now , just ecause your fucking the President 's daughter ?
ADRIAN: What are you all waiting for ?
TECHNICAL OFFICER: If we ca n't close the stern gate , then the engines wo n't start .
ADRIAN: There 's no way to override it ?
TECHNICAL OFFICER: No sir , it has to be done manually .
NENG: Almost there , Lin
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER: Water has penetrated the stern !
LAURA: What now ?
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER: The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time .
ADRIAN: Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber ?
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER: If we do n't hurry , we wo n't be able to .
KATE: Tamara ! Take Lilly and Noah .
LILLY: Mummy !
TAMARA: Lilly run !
ADRIAN: Is there any way to talk to them ?
JACKSON: We have to move him higher . Over there !
NAVAL OFFICER: Moving at 34 knots , sir .
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: What is our position ?
NAVIGATION OFFICER: Darjeeling valley , heading south east , sir .
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: You must be kidding !
KATE: We need something to stop the bleeding or he 'll die .
NOAH: Mum , will this do ?
ADRIAN: Mr. Curtis I 'm Adrian Helmsley . We met once before . Your daughter is with me .
KATE: Lilly !
LILLY: I 'm alright Mom !
ADRIAN: You 're our only hope .
JACKSON: I 'll go back . I 'll try my best .
NOAH: I 'll go with you .
JACKSON: You stay with Mommy .
ANHEUSER: Captain , what 's happening ?
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: What 's happening ?
PAUSES: We 're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest , Mr. Anheuser .
KATE: Noah !
NOAH: Mom , we did it !
ADRIAN: Captain Michaels - close the gate !
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: That 's affirmative . Close the gate !
TECHNICAL OFFICER: Ay , ay , Sir .
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: Engage starboard stabilizers !
OFFICERS: One is engaged two is engaged number three is out , sir !
KATE: Noah ! Where is he ?
NOAH: He was just behind me
JACKSON: If you would ever consider to give me another chance I promise , I 'll always be there when you need me .
KATE: Whatever you do I will never let you go again .
ADRIAN: and all we can hear is the sound of our own breathing that reminds us we are still sharing our memories , hopes and ideas .
PAUSE: The end .
LAURA: How many copies did you say that sold ?
ADRIAN: Less than 500 . It 's what you might call a cult classic .
LAURA: It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley ?
ADRIAN: Well that 's healthy Dr. Wilson . Something we could maybe explore unless you have other pressing engagements .
LAURA: Actually my diary 's pretty open .
LILLY: Daddy ? When can we go back home ?
JACKSON: There 's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee . Whatever 's out there , that 's our home now . Do n't be scared .
LILLY: I 'm not Daddy . No more pull-ups .
JACKSON: That 's my big girl .
LILLY: Of course you can . He 's your doggie .
ADRIAN: You called for me , sir ?
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: Prof. West has something to show you , Mr. Helmsley .
PROF. WEST: The water is receding much faster than we projected , Adrian
LAURA: What 's that ?
PROF. WEST: It 's hard to believe , but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world . It 's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal . The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely , never even flooded .
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: Our European colleagues have already set course for it .
ADRIAN: This is Helmsley .
VOICE: No , this is Helmsley .
CAPTAIN MICHAELS: We should have a visual of the ` Freedom of the Seas ' shortly .
ADRIAN: Dad . We 're coming to pick you guys up . How 's Tony ?
HARRY HELMSLEY: He 's fine , son . We 're all fine .
ADRIAN: Pardon me ?
ANHEUSER: There was no white kid better than you . I 'm terribly sorry I said that .
OFFICER: Standing by Sir .
MRS. PANG: I wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars ?
MR.PANG: Do not fear . Some things will neve change .
JACKSON: I thought you might want this .
NOAH: Do you think I 'll still get a signal Dad ?
ADRIAN: I finally finished your book Jackson .
KATE: Really ? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end .
JACKSON: Excuse me , I believe he 's addressing the author . Well , what did you think ?
ADRIAN: I 'd say those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves , if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole .
CHIEF ACTIVIST: Fucking hell
FEMALE ACTIVIST: Oh God
CHIEF ACTIVIST: Keep your shit together . If we 're going to get them out of here
FINNISH ACTIVIST: I can pop these , no problem .
CHIEF ACTIVIST: So get to it .
SCIENTIST: Security ! We have a break-in ! Get to sector A hand slams down the disconnect button .
CHIEF ACTIVIST: If you do n't want to get hurt , shut your mouth , and do n't move a fucking muscle .
SCIENTIST: The chimps are infected ! The Activists hesitate , exchanging a glance .
FLUSTERED: These animals are highly contagious . They 've been given an inhibitor .
CHIEF ACTIVIST: Infected with what ?
SCIENTIST: Chemically restricted , locked down to a a single impulse that
CHIEF ACTIVIST: Infected with what ? The Scientist hesitates before answering .
SCIENTIST: Rage .
EXPLAIN: In order to cure , you must first understand . Just imagine to have power over all the things we feel we ca n't control . Anger , violence
FINNISH ACTIVIST: What the fuck is he talking about ?
CHIEF ACTIVIST: We do n't have time for this shit ! Get the cages open !
SCIENTIST: No !
CHIEF ACTIVIST: We 're going , you sick bastard , and we 're taking your torture victims with us .
SCIENTIST: NO ! You must listen ! The animals are contagious ! The infection is in their blood and saliva ! One bite and
FEMALE ACTIVIST: They wo n't bite me .
SCIENTIST: STOP ! You have no idea !
FEMALE ACTIVIST: Good boy . You do n't want to bite me , do you ?
SCIENTIST: NO !
FEMALE ACTIVIST: Get it off ! Get if off !
SCIENTIST: We have to kill her !
FEMALE ACTIVIST: I 'm burning ! I 'm burning !
CHIEF ACTIVIST: What 's
SCIENTIST: We have to kill her NOW !
CHIEF ACTIVIST: What 's wrong with them ?
SCIENTIST: Oh God .
ACTIVIST: Terry ? Jemma ?
JIM: Ow
WOMAN'S VOICE: HERE !
JIM: Those people ! Who were who
MARK: This way ! Move it ! Jim allows himself to be hurried along .
SELENA: Who are you ? You 've come from a hospital .
MARK: Are you a doctor ?
SELENA: He 's not a doctor . He 's a patient .
JIM: I 'm a bicycle courier . I was riding a package from Farringdon to Shaftesbury Avenue . A car cut across me and then I wake up in hospital , today I wake up and I 'm hallucinating , or
MARK: What 's your name ?
JIM: Jim .
MARK: I 'm Mark . This is Selena .
BEAT: Okay , Jim . We 've got some bad news .
SELENA: It began as rioting . And right from the beginning , you knew something ad was going on because the ioters were killing people . And then it was n't on the TV anymore . It was in the street outside . It was coming through your windows . We all guessed it was a virus . An infection . You did n't need a docto to tell you that . It was the blood .
JIM: Where are your families ?
MARK: They 're dead .
SELENA: Yours will be dead too .
JIM: No No ! I 'm going to find them . They live in Greenwich . I can walk . I 'm going to to go and
SELENA: You 'll go and come back .
JIM: Yes ! I 'll go and come back .
MARK: Rules of survival . Lesson one - you never go anywhere alone , unless you 've got no choice . Lesson two - you only move during daylight , unless you 've got no choice . We 'll take you tomorrow . Then we 'll all go and find your dead parents . Okay ?
JIM: Down there . Westlink Street . Second on the left .
SELENA: If there 's anyone in there who is n't human
JIM: I understand .
SELENA: Anyone .
JIM: I understand .
MARK: Okay .
SELENA: They died peacefully . You should be grateful .
JIM: I 'm not grateful .
MARK: The roads out were all jammed . So we went to Paddington Station . Hoping maybe we could get to Heathrow , maybe buy our way on a plane . My dad had all this cash , even though cash was already useless , and Mum had her jewellery . But twenty thousand other people had the same idea .
A MOMENT: The crowd was surging , and I lost my grip on my sister 's hand . I emember realizing the ground was soft . I looked down , and I was standing on people . Like a carpet , people who had fallen , and somewhere in the crowd there were infected . It spread fast , no one could run , all you could do was climb . Over more people . So I did that . I got up , somehow , on top of a kiosk .
MARK: Selena 's right . You should be grateful .
SELENA: We do n't have time to get back to the shop before dark . We should stay here tonight . Jim nods . He is n't sure what he wants to say .
JIM: My old room was at the end of the landing . You two take it . I 'll sleep down here .
SELENA: We 'll sleep in the same room . It 's safer .
JIM'S DAD: Give me a glass of that , would you ?
JIM: It 's empty .
SELENA: Were you bitten ?
JIM: He lives four doors down
SELENA: Were you bitten ?
JIM: No No ! I was n't !
SELENA: Did any of the blood get in you mouth ?
JIM: No !
SELENA: Mark ?
MARK: Wait .
SELENA: Get that cleaned off .
JIM: I I do n't know . I think so .
SELENA: Then get them . And get dressed . We have to leave , now .
JIM: How did you know ? Selena says nothing . Continues walking .
SELENA: The blood .
JIM: The blood was everywhere . On me , on you , and
SELENA: I did n't know he was infected . Okay ? I did n't know . He knew . I could see it in his face .
A MOMENT: You need to understand , if someone gets infected , you 've got somewhere etween ten and twenty seconds to kill them . They might be you other or your sister or you oldest friend . It makes no difference Just so as you know , if it happens to you , I 'll do it in a heartbeat . A moment .
JIM: How long had you known him ?
SELENA: Five days . Or six . Does it matter ? Jim says nothing .
JIM: Let 's hope we do n't have to get out of here in a hurry . She begins to climb through .
SELENA: Need a break ?
JIM: No . You ?
SELENA: No . They continue a few steps .
JIM: I do need a break , by the way .
SELENA: What 's up ?
JIM: Nothing . She gives him a cut-the-crap expression .
SELENA: Bad ?
JIM: Pretty bad .
SELENA: Why did n't you say something efore ?
JIM: Because I did n't think you 'd give a shit .
SELENA: You 've got no fat on you , and all you 've had to eat is sugar . So you 're crashing . Unfortunately , there is n't a lot we can do about that
CHEWING CODEINE: Do you have Sprite ?
SELENA: Actually , I did have a can of Sprite , but
JIM: Jesus !
SELENA: Quiet .
JIM: I ca n't .
MAN: Down the corridor ! Flat 157 !
SELENA: Let us in !
GIRL: Where 's Dad ? Jim looks back down the corridor .
MAN: It 's okay , Hannah . Let them inside .
JIM: I 'm Jim .
SELENA: Selena .
FRANK: Jim and Selena . Good to meet you . And this is my daughter , Hannah . Come on , sweetheart . Say hello .
HANNAH: We 've got Mum 's creme de menthe . An awkward beat .
FRANK: Yes , her creme de menthe . Great . Look , sit , please . Get comfortable . Sit tight while I get it .
SELENA: Shall we ?
HANNAH: Middle cupboard .
JIM: This is your place , then . Hannah nods .
FRANK: There ! I know it is n't much but well , cheers !
SELENA: We 're grateful .
FRANK: Well , we 're grateful you came . I was starting to really worry . Like I say , we have n't seen any sign of anyone normal for a while now .
JIM: There are n't any others in the uilding ? Frank shakes his head .
SELENA: And you have n't seen any people outside ? Frank 's eyes flick to Hannah .
FRANK: We have n't left the block for more than two weeks . Stayed right here . Only sensible thing to do . Everyone who went out
SELENA: Did n't come back .
FRANK: And there 's two hundred flats here . Most of them have a few cans of food , or cereal , or something .
SELENA: It 's a good set-up .
FRANK: It is n't bad .
JIM: Yes . Fine .
FRANK: Have to empty it each morning . We just chuck it over the balcony No mod cons here .
JIM: It 's fine .
FRANK: Well , look , it 's pretty late . I 'm going to turn in . We 've got a spare room . Are you and Selena ?
JIM: I 'll take the living room .
FRANK: Oh , right . I mean , yes So , good night then , anyway .
JIM: Good night , Frank . Frank smiles , and heads to his bedroom .
SELENA: Very spruce .
JIM: Very shredded .
SELENA: Uh-huh .
JIM: So what do you make of them ?
SELENA: They 're desperate . Probably need us more than we need them .
JIM: I think they 're good people .
SELENA: Good people ?
JIM: Yeah .
SELENA: Well , that 's nice . But you should e more concerned about whethe they 're going to slow you down .
JIM: Right . Because if they slowed you down
SELENA: I 'd leave them behind .
JIM: In a heartbeat .
SELENA: Yeah .
JIM: I would n't .
SELENA: Then you 're going to wind up getting yourself killed . A moment . Then Selena stands .
JIM: Selena - you think I do n't get it . But I do get it . And I know I 'd be dead already if I had n't met you . Selena hesitates at the door - then turns .
SELENA: Sure .
JIM: No , look - I mean thank you .
SELENA: And I mean sure . Good night , Jim . She exits , leaving Jim alone .
JIM: Good night .
FRANK: Morning , Jim .
JIM: Morning .
FRANK: Listen , have you got a minute ?
JIM: They 're all empty
FRANK: It has n't rained in over a week . Frank sits , watching Jim .
JIM: Right .
FRANK: No . It 's not what you think .
SELENA: There have n't been any broadcasts for weeks .
FRANK: Just listen .
SELENA: Soldiers .
FRANK: There 's more . Listen .
JIM: It 's a recording ?
FRANK: It 's a recording . But this is where it 's telling us to go . Frank points to the location described .
JIM: The North
FRANK: The way things are , we might need two or three days to get up there .
SELENA: We .
FRANK: Sound carries in this flat . Jerry- uilt , I suppose , and me and Hannah do need you more than you need us .
SELENA: I was n't -
FRANK: It 's okay . Look , it 's the truth . I ca n't leave the block if it 's just the two of us .
SELENA: If it 's a recording , for all we know the soldiers who made it are dead .
FRANK: Yes . It 's possible .
SELENA: And that stuff about the answer to infection . There is no answer to infection . It 's already done pretty much all the damage it can .
JIM: Maybe they 've got a cure .
SELENA: Maybe they 've got nothing at all .
FRANK: The only way to find out is to each them .
SELENA: We could die trying .
HANNAH: Or die here .
JIM: Get there how ?
FRANK: Just so as you know . I do n't take cheques or credit cards .
SELENA: It 's the most direct route to the other side of the river .
JIM: Then we should go the indirect oute . The one in broad daylight . That is n't underground .
FRANK: Let 's just get it done .
JIM: I knew this was a shit idea . You know why ? Because it was really obviously a shit idea . Driving into a dark tunnel , full of smashed cars and broken glass is really fucking obviously a shit idea .
FRANK: HOLD ON !
JIM: The world 's worst place to get a flat .
FRANK: Agreed . I think we 'd better do this quick .
JIM: You heard that ?
FRANK: ( from the front of the
CAB: Heard what ?
JIM: Holy shit . A tide of rats is rushing under their feet .
FRANK: ( as the rats rush around
THEM: What the fuck ?
SELENA: They 're running from the infected .
FRANK: Hannah , get out , get out ! Just lift it ! LIFT IT !
SELENA: ( straining with the
WEIGHT: Come on !
HANNAH: Almost there !
FRANK: Go ! Go !
JIM: Fuck you ! Frank slams his foot down , and they tear off .
FRANK: Honey , you 're a cab driver 's daughter .
SELENA: Whoa ! Stop the cab ! Stop the cab !
JIM: You 're getting out ?
SELENA: This place has n't been looted . It 's a gold mine .
HANNAH: But we do n't know what 's in there .
SELENA: Food and drink is what 's in there . And we need it . Selena gets out .
JIM: Wait !
SELENA: I 've been living off Mars Bars and Coke for two weeks . I need some tinned fruit .
JIM: It 's okay . I think you can eat this stuff raw .
FRANK: Mmm . Irradiated .
SELENA: Ugh . If I never see chocolate again , it 'll be too soon .
HANNAH: ( taking a handful of
YORKIE BARS: Or Yorkies .
SELENA: Or Yorkies , obviously .
FRANK: Put that back . We ca n't just take any crap .
JIM: It is n't any crap . It 's whisky . It might be good to have .
FRANK: Who 's arguing about whisky ? I 'm saying , do n't get a cheap blend . Frank takes a bottle of Lagavulin .
SELENA: We could have a problem here .
JIM: Jesus Christ . We 're never going to e able to get out of London .
FRANK: Do n't you worry about that . I 've sat twenty years in this seat . I 've got my routes .
HANNAH: Yes , Dad .
SELENA: Stay close , Jim .
JIM: What ?
SELENA: You heard .
JIM: We do n't have any cheeseburgers .
TO HIMSELF: `` Stay close . '' It 's like going on holiday with your fucking aunt .
SELENA: Find anything . Jim says nothing .
JIM: No .
FRANK: Okay . We 're done . He lifts a hand to Hannah .
HANNAH: ( leaning out of the
WINDOW: I am a cab driver 's daughter .
FRANK: You 're Ayrton Senna 's bloody daughter .
JIM: Who 's unbelievably hungry ?
ALL: Me .
JIM: Let 's have a picnic .
SELENA: Oh my God , yes . I can taste the vitamin C. I can feel it in my lood .
JIM: These are great . They 're like huge iscuits . He offers half to Hannah , who takes a bite .
HANNAH: It 's true . They are like biscuits .
JIM: An de phraisins ar phrill moipht . Hannah and Selena laugh .
HANNAH: What did you say ?
JIM: I said , the raisins are still moist . Selena and Hannah laugh again .
FRANK: Hey . Everyone turns .
HANNAH: Do you think they 're infected ?
FRANK: No . I think they 're doing just fine .
JIM: You know what I was thinking ? Selena considers this a moment .
SELENA: You were thinking that you 'll neve hear another piece of original music ever again . You 'll never read a book that is n't already written . Or see a film that is n't already shot . Jim smiles .
JIM: That 's what you were thinking .
SELENA: No I was thinking I was wrong .
JIM: About what ?
SELENA: All the death , all the shit - it does n't really mean anything fo Frank and Hannah . Because she 's got her dad , and he 's got his daughter , so it 's okay . A beat .
JIM: That 's what I was thinking .
SELENA: Was it ?
JIM: Uh-huh . You stole my thought .
SELENA: Sorry .
JIM: ( slightly surprised , but
PLEASED: Ah , keep it .
FRANK: It 's getting late . We should stay here the night . Jim raises a hand in reply .
HANNAH: Ca n't sleep .
JIM: Nor can I . It does n't feel safe , outdoors like this .
FRANK: I think we 're safe enough . A couple of moments pass .
HANNAH: Selena did n't seem to have any trouble .
JIM: I know . I noticed that too . ( reaching over and shaking
SELENA'S SHOULDER: SelenaSelena !
JIM: How did you manage to get to sleep ?
FRANK: Bloody hell . You must have needed a hell of a prescription for that lot .
SELENA: I did n't need a prescription . I 'm a qualified chemist .
JIM: Valium . Great . Not only will it get us to sleep , but if we get attacked during the night , we wo n't even care . Two each ?
FRANK: Not for me , thanks .
INDICATING HANNAH: What about ?
HANNAH: Can I , Dad ?
FRANK: I do n't know , honey .
HANNAH: Da-ad , plee-ease . I ca n't sleep .
FRANK: All right , all right . Give her half of one .
THE DRIVER: You stupid cunt !
JIM: Fuck you !
FRANK: Hey .
JIM: What
FRANK: Shh . You 're having a bad dream , that 's all . Jim 's face relaxes a little .
JIM: ( mumbled , half-asleep
ALREADY: Okay , Dad . Frank raises his eyebrows , then smiles .
JIM: Here you go , Frank . This is how you catch dew . I 'm covered in the fucking stuff .
FRANK: Okay . Let 's get rolling . If we make good time , we 'll be there before midday .
JIM: Bloody hell
FRANK: It must be Manchester .
JIM: But , the whole of Manchester . The whole city
SELENA: No fire crews to put it out . We see what they are looking at
JIM: It ca n't be
HANNAH: Is it snow ?
FRANK: ( hitting the windscreen
WIPERS: It 's ash .
FRANK: Okay , everyone . I think this is it .
JIM: Try the horn .
SELENA: Do n't . We might attract the wrong kind of attention .
FRANK: What do you think ?
JIM: It looks deserted .
SELENA: Or overrun .
FRANK: Let 's check it out .
HANNAH: I do n't understand . Did they leave ?
JIM: They did n't all leave .
SELENA: I do n't like this . I think we should go .
SUDDENLY SNAPPING: No !
COMPOSES HIMSELF: The vehicles . We should check the vehicles first . There has to be something
FRANK: Nothing . Nothing here . I ca n't elieve it .
SELENA: Frank .
FRANK: `` We should go . ''
SELENA: Yes .
FRANK: Go fucking where ? What the fuck are we supposed to do ? How is this going to fucking end ? It 's neve going to -
SUDDENLY SHOUTING: GET OUT OF IT !
HANNAH: Dad are you okay ?
FRANK: I I 'm fine , honey . I 'm sorry . I just lost my temper . I He breaks off .
HANNAH: What ? Frank frowns . A hand goes to his temple .
FRANK: Hannah
HANNAH: Dad ?
FRANK: Get away from me !
TO JIM: Get her away from me !
HANNAH: Why ? What 's
FRANK: GET AWAY FROM ME ! 63 .
SELENA: Jim Jim , he 's infected !
HANNAH: No ! No !
SELENA: Jim ! But Jim is frozen , holding his baseball bat . Frank screams again . Then drops to his knees .
HANNAH: Dad !
SELENA: Jim !
HANNAH: Dad ? Selena lets Hannah go .
CLIFTON: STAY AWAY FROM HIM !
FARRELL: Get away from the man ! NOW !
SELENA: Jesus .
HENRY: I 'm Major Henry West . Welcome . We 've got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water . So you can all have a shower . You look like you need one .
JIM: Yes .
HENRY: We must be a disappointment . You were hoping for a full brigade . An army base , with helicopters and field hospitals .
JIM: We were hoping for
HENRY: The answer to infection . Well , as I said , it 's here . Though it may not e quite what you imagined .
JIM: I did n't know what to imagine , so We just feel lucky to have found you .
HENRY: You were lucky . The fire drove hundreds of infected out of Manchester . The surrounding area is teeming with them . Henry glances back at Jim .
JONES: It 's a surprise , sir !
HENRY: And finally
JIM: You 're keeping him alive ?
HENRY: The idea was to learn something about infection . Have him teach me .
JIM: And has he ?
HENRY: In a way .
KNEELS: He 's teaching me he 'll never bake ead . Plant crops , raise livestock . He 's telling me he 's futureless . And eventually he 'll tell me how long the infected take to starve to death .
HENRY: Dinner 's at seven . Do n't forget to tell the girls . Henry exits , leaving Jim with Mailer . Mailer lunges at Jim - a moment between them . Then Jim exits .
JIM: So how is she ?
SELENA: She 's lost her dad . That 's how she is .
A MOMENT: It 's all fucked , Jim .
JIM: Hey , don'tdo that . Look , Hannah Hannah 's what Frank said she was . Tough . Strong . And just like me , just like you , she will cope
SELENA: Shut up , Jim . Just shut up . I do n't want her to fucking cope . I want her to be okay . And when Hannah had her dad , it was all okay . Remember ? And when it was okay for them , it was okay for us . And now it 's all fucked .
HENRY: So , what have we here ? Tinned ham , tinned peas , and omelette . You 've prepared a feast , Jones .
JONES: Honor of our guests , sir .
HENRY: Absolutely . I was going to suggest a toast , but this omelette will do just as well . To new friends .
JONES: I thought the salt might cover the taste , sir .
HENRY: Get rid of it .
DAVIS: That 's a fucking disappointment . When I saw those eggs , I thought it was Christmas .
BELL: We 'll have eggs again . Once everything 's back to normal .
MITCHELL: Listen to him ! He 's still waiting for Marks and Spencer 's to reopen .
FARRELL: I think Bell 's got a point . If you look at the whole life of the planet , man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye . So if the infection wipes us all out , that is a return to normality . Farrell turns to Bell .
BELL: Uhyeah .
HENRY: Have you met our new-age sergeant ?
TO FARRELL: Remind me , Farrell , why exactly did you join the army in the first place . A moment .
HENRY: This is what I 've seen in the fou weeks since infection . People killing people . Which is much what I saw in the four weeks before infection , and the four weeks efore that , and before that , as far back as I care to remember People killing people . Which to my mind puts us in a state of normality right now . Selena turns to Hannah .
SELENA: You 're not eating .
HANNAH: I do n't want to eat . Henry picks up on their exchange .
HENRY: You must eat , Hannah .
HANNAH: I do n't want to eat . I want to bury my dad . He 's one of the people you 're talking about . A silence over the dinner table . Broken by the thud of a mine detonation . Then
FARRELL: Stand to !
MITCHELL: Go , go , go !
FARRELL: Jones ! Cover right !
SMITH: Three o'clock ! Three o'clock !
MITCHELL: That was mad ! Did you see that ! That was fucking mad !
FARRELL: Clear !
JONES: Clear .
MITCHELL: Clear .
TO JONES: Fuck me , I never saw that before . Keeled over and - bam ! Gone , like fucking magic .
SMITH: I drew a lovely bead . One shot . Right between its eyes .
MITCHELL: It was all hanging in the air , and all these bits coming down , and
SOLDIERS: But listen , if you want to hold a huge chopper
MITCHELL: Whoa ! Feisty ! He gives her a slap on the backside .
SELENA: Fuck you !
MITCHELL: You bet . How about right now ?
FARRELL: MITCHELL !
ANGRILY GRABBING: MITCHELL ) Cut it out !
MITCHELL: Easy , tiger . You do n't want to go picking a fight with me .
HENRY: Corporal , first point of orde after an attack .
MITCHELL: Re-secure the perimeter , sir .
HENRY: Then get to it . Jones , Bedford , go with him .
TO FARRELL: Sergeant .
FARRELL: Sir .
HENRY: Clear the bodies off the lawn . The est of you go with him .
JIM: Look . We 're grateful . Very grateful for your protection , and just to have found other people . But if we 're going to stay here with you , you 're going to have to stop you men from -
HENRY: Who have you killed ?
JIM: I have n't killed anyone . Henry hands Jim his drink .
HENRY: Since it began , who have you killed ? You would n't be alive now if you had n't killed somebody .
JIM: A boy . I killed a boy .
HENRY: A child ?
JIM: Yes .
HENRY: But you had to . Otherwise he 'd have killed you . Survival . I understand .
BEAT: I promised them women .
JIM: What ?
HENRY: Eight days ago I found Jones with his gun in this mouth . He said he was going to kill himself because there was no future . What could I say to him ? We kill all the infected or wait until they starve to death . And then what ? What do nine men do except wait to die themselves ?
BEAT: I moved us from the blockade , I set the radio broadcasting , and I promised them women . Because women mean children . Jim turns and runs out of the room .
HENRY: And children mean a future .
JIM: Get up . Get up !
SELENA: Wha
JIM: We 've got to get out of here !
SELENA: But we
JIM: We 're leaving . Now ! NOW !
FARRELL: You ca n't do this ! You ca n't do this ! Get back ! I 'll fucking slot you ! I 'll slot you , I fucking swea it !
HENRY: I want to give you a chance . You can be with us , or not .
FARRELL'S VOICE: He 's insane .
FARRELL: You know what they 're doing , a few hundred miles from here ? Across the channel , across the Atlantic , they 're eating dinner . They 're wondering what to watch on TV tonight . They 're sleeping next to their wives . Jim 's head turns .
BEAT: He 's insane .
JIM: Quarantine ?
FARRELL: Come on then , you fucking pansies . Do me first . Mitchell grins , and pulls out his bayonet .
TO JONES: Is that how you 're going to let your sergeant go out , Jones ?
JONES: No , Mitch . Do it with the gun .
FARRELL: You 're going to let him stick me , are you ? Like a fucking dog ?
JONES: Mitch , come on . Just shoot him .
MITCHELL: Why ?
JONES: Because it 's quick .
MITCHELL: So ? The bayonet fixes home with a click .
JONES: I 'll shoot him , then .
MITCHELL: You fucking wo n't .
TO FARRELL: Any last words ? Farrell spits in Mitchell 's face .
MITCHELL: I 'm going to enjoy this .
JONES: How did he They turn . Jim has vanished .
MITCHELL: No problem . He 's outside . No gun . No vehicle . He 's a dead man .
SELENA: You ca n't do this to her ! She 's only fourteen !
CLIFTON: The OC . He he wants you to
SELENA: He wants us to dress up nice .
CLIFTON: Okay . Clear out . They exit .
SELENA: Eat them . Hannah hesitates .
HANNAH: Are you killing me ?
SELENA: No . I 'm making you not care .
CLIFTON: Hey ! What the fuck are you doing ? Selena crams the pills into Hannah 's mouth .
SELENA: Jim .
BEDFORD: He 's at the blockade !
JONES: He went over the wall ! We thought he 'd be dead sir !
HENRY: Shut up ! Davis - you 're coming with me !
DAVIS: Fuck . Davis turns , and sees
HENRY: Jim ?
JONES: What was that ? Was that a claymore ?
MITCHELL: It was lightning .
JONES: But I heard something . A moment . Rain and wind lash the windows .
MITCHELL: I 'll go and hit the floods . Take a utcher 's . Girls , keep an eye on him , would you ? Mitchell exits .
HANNAH: Those pills . I think they 're having an effect . I can feel them , and I do n't feel sleepy , but
JONES: Shut up .
HANNAH: I do n't think they are coming back . I think they 've been killed .
JONES: I told you to shut up !
SELENA: Hannah
HANNAH: They 're dead .
JONES: Shit ! At that moment , the floodlights power up
CLIFTON: Help ! Shoot him ! Shoot him !
SELENA: Hannah ! Hannah ! We have to get out of here ! Mailer vomits blood into Clifton 's face .
HANNAH: ( relaxed , as she 's yanked
ALONG: Do n't worry . I feel fine . Really .
MITCHELL: What the fuck 's going on ? What 's all the shouti
BEDFORD: What the fuck are you going to do now , eh ?
GRABBING SELENA: Up ! Up !
BELL: Mitchell ? What 's going on ?
MITCHELL: Stay here and defend these stairs with your fucking life !
SELENA: Hannah !
JIM: Hannah ! Selena ! He tries another door . Open .
BELL: I do n't have any bullets ! I do n't have any fucking bullets !
SELENA: Hannah !
MITCHELL: Shut your fucking mouth ! You want to get us killed ? Mitchell opens a door
JIM: That was longer than a heartbeat .
SELENA: Jim ?
JIM: Listen to me . I 've got to tell you - I 've got to tell you . The world is n't fucked . It 's going to be okay . We 've got a chance , if we can get to
SELENA: Hannah ! Stop ! It 's okay !
HANNAH: I thought he was biting you .
JIM: ( holding the back of his
HEAD: I was kissing her !
BREAKS OFF: Are you stoned ?
SELENA: It 's a long story .
HENRY: You killed all my boys .
SELENA: Jim !
HENRY: WhatHannah ! Hannah ?
SELENA: We 're going to crash ! The gates loom . Hannah speeds towards them .
JIM: Just fucking do it !
JIM: Jesus . Not the curtains too .
HANNAH: There ! THERE !
JIM: Do you think he saw us this time ?
WILL: Gim me a break . You guys live two towns away . It 's pretty much fucking impossible to get here in 30 minutes .
PEEKS INSIDE: Got the house to yourselves ?
WILL: Not bad . Any jailbait in there ? Little pizza and a rainbow party ? The kids shakes their heads .
MORE: 3 .
BEAT: But I get to keep the change as a tip . Deal ?
WILL: I 'll see you in like 20 minutes .
CHRISTOPHER: You have a pretty good shift ?
WILL: For sure . I mean , the part where I had to drop off all those pizzas kinda sucked , but the rest was cool .
CHRISTOPHER: Oh , yeah ? 'Cause , I got some kids calling in saying you ripped them off . Promised to buy them beer or something .
WILL: I actually did buy the beer , but it would have been illegal to give it to them , right ? So I 'm gon na do the esponsible thing and drink it myself .
CHRISTOPHER: That 's real funny . But I 'm trying to run a business here .
WILL: What kind of business promises to deliver anywhere in 30 minutes ? It 's ridiculous .
CHRISTOPHER: I do n't wan na hear another one of your bullshit excuses . You 're fired .
WILL: Come on . If I did n't need this job , I would n't be doing this shitty job . Chris is unmoving .
CHRISTOPHER: You know , you were an okay drive half the time . And you 're not a Puerto Rican . Which means something to me .
WILL: That 's poignant .
CHRISTOPHER: I guess I could rehire you , on a provisional basis . Of course , this would be at the slightly reduced `` new company rate . ''
WILL: Are you fucking serious ?
CHRISTOPHER: I do n't know . Is there anyone else left in town for you to work for ?
WILL: When do I start ?
CHET: What the hell ? Have you just been sitting there ?
WILL: Yep . Caught the whole show . Really classy move at the end . You know , the kiss . Putting your tongue in her mouth right after you fucked it .
CHET: Hey , a nice girl decides to pleasure me on a weeknight , in her car no lessI 'm not gon na make her feel like an untouchable . I 'm gon na make her feel like a lady .
WILL: What manners . May I offer you some alcohol , sir . To wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth .
CHET: By the way , she said she had a friend . Maybe we can go on our first double date since you tried to talk Jackie Fortunato and her cousin into having a four-way with us .
WILL: I misread their body language . It happens .
FANS MOVIES: Old favorites . You choose . Lethal Weapon , Lethal Weapon 2was gon na get the third Lethal Weapon , but decided on a porn . So it 's really etween the first two .
CHET: I choose sleep . I got ta teach a class at eight .
WILL: You 're a sub . Just call in sick . Like the real teacher did .
CHET: Come on , man , you know I got promoted to full-time last month . You bought me a laser pointer . Will heaves a sigh .
WILL: Yeah , I know . I guess I 'm just having a hard time accepting you as `` the man . '' You know , flunking kids , giving out spite detentions to girls you wan na fuck , laser pointing at shit .
CHET: I also get healthcare and my summers off . It 's not perfect , but it 's a career . Will grudgingly stands up .
WILL: I guess that 's just the difference etween you and me . He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs .
CHET: I just got head . I 'm totally Riggs . Will shakes his head , turns and walks off .
WILL: Fuck .
DWAYNE: Fruit motherfuckin ' salad !
JAY: This one 's gon na blow even bigger .
DWAYNE: Boy , if you were n't such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something .
JAY: Whatever . I do n't need the military . I taught myself how to do this shit .
DWAYNE: I hear that . I taught myself how to eat pussy . And cut my own hair .
JAY: I thought you wanted to get diesel for the summer . Bang that towel girl at the community pool .
DWAYNE: It 's obvious you do n't know shit-all about physical fitness . You got ta ulk up first , then you slim down . I 'm clearly in the bulk up phase . I told you to watch Pumping Iron like a month ago . If you 'd listened to me , maybe you 'd know what the fuck I 'm talking about .
BEAT: Grab some RC Cola .
JAY: Shit , man ! It 's so real !
DWAYNE: Check it out . I ai n't afraid of Jason . I 'm fucking him .
THRUSTING HARDER: You like that , Jason ! ? In the mask ! Jay cracks up . The lights flick on .
JAY: Afternoon , Major . Dwayne flops back onto the couch .
DWAYNE: Dad , we 're watching a flick . We got 45 minutes and a potential 3D sex scene left . You 're sorta coming in at the worst possible moment .
MAJOR: I bought that TV set so I could watch my programs , not so you and you friend could louse up my couch .
DWAYNE: You got ta learn how to share the common space .
MAJOR: The only thing common in this house is you . You remind me of your damn mother . Fat , dumb , and in my way .
DWAYNE: Let 's get outta here . This movie sucks anyway .
MAJOR: I paid for the damn cold cuts , too . Maybe if you had a job , or a fucking prospect , or a clue how to find any of the above , I 'd let you eat 'em .
DWAYNE: You know , you can be a real sonofabitch , dad .
MAJOR: That 's what it takes , boy . In the Corps , men like you wore dresses to keep us entertained .
DWAYNE: That 's pretty fucking disturbing ! Dwayne storms off .
BEAT: He did n't even raise me . My mothe did . That was a good woman .
JUICY: Oh yeah ? What happened to her ?
DWAYNE: She passed on .
JUICY: I hope you 're not one of those guys that comes here looking to get mothered .
DWAYNE: I would n't mind nursing on them titties , mamacita .
JUICY: Sure . Whatever you say . Maybe just keep quiet for a while , forget about your old man and let me do my thing .
DWAYNE: I wish I could forget about that asshole for good . I 'm just waiting around for him to drop dead . Do n't wan na mess with my inheritance . This piques Juicy 's interest .
JUICY: What kinda inheritance ?
DWAYNE: When my dad got outta the service , he started buying lotto tickets . He 'd play his dog tag numbers . In '91 , the fucker won five million bucks .
JUICY: You know , with a million bucks , you could have anything . Be like a king . King Dwayne .
DWAYNE: That 's right . And maybe I 'll make you my queen . Let you polish my oyal scepter .
JUICY: Practice makes perfect .
DWAYNE: Hate him like the Steelers .
JUICY: Then maybe I can help you get that money now . Before he spends anothe penny .
DWAYNE: Do what ?
JUICY: Kill your mean old dad .
WILL: Rio ?
KATE: That 's the plan . Five days , six nights . Culture . Beaches . Acceptable probability of kidnapping . I leave in the morning .
WILL: Oh , the places you 'll go .
KATE: Fuck Expedia . Travel Advisor . Making it seem so easy .
WILL: It is . Just do it . Get away for a while .
KATE: Even if I could afford thatthey fired two other paralegals last week . Now 's not the time to be putting in for vacation days .
WILL: Ok . Done . I 've got my dose of the actual working world . Can we eat ? Will lays a pizza down on her desk .
KATE: How do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard ?
WILL: He 's there like half the time . The other half I smile at him . I 'm elatively certain he 's a homosexual .
KATE: Interesting theory Kate opens the pizza box , grabs a slice .
WILL: That kid beat the hell out of me and Chet in grammar school . Wow .
KATE: Tell me about it . He fingered me at junior prom while they were playing `` No Scrubs . ''
WILL: Really ? What a fucking scrub .
KATE: So , I 've got some news
WILL: I thought the Tom Small stuff was enough of a headline , but go ahead .
KATE: I 'm getting back together with Mark .
WILL: But youyou broke up with himended the relationship . Finality was had .
KATE: Yeah , but we were talking and -
WILL: Forget it . I do n't want to know .
KATE: You sound like Chet .
WILL: Woah , do n't compare me to you other .
KATE: Well , neither one of you seems to care that I do n't have a life . Mark 's not perfectbut a relationship is etter than working late every Friday ecause I have nowhere else to be .
WILL: Sure . I get it . Here we are . Friday night . Nowhere to be . Kate shoves Will , good-naturedly .
KATE: You know what I mean .
JAY: I do n't wan na stick my nose into a family matterbut killing your old man ? That 's pretty messed upI mean , unless you think it is n't .
DWAYNE: What we have here is a classic `` lesse of two evils '' debate . You got one evil me shaving a few years off The Major 's shitty life . Then you got the other evil The Major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance . Maybe I 'm biased , ut mine sure as shit seems like the lesser .
JAY: I guess Isorta see where you 're coming from . And you have been waiting around forever for that money . You deserve it , Dwayne . Dwayne nods , seriously .
DWAYNE: You know , there 's a reason I sleep 'til noon everyday . And it ai n't 'cause I 'm lazy . It 's on account of me having so many goddamn dreams . Big ones . And once that money 's mine , they 're all gon na come true .
JAY: Wow . I did n't know you dreamt about me , Dwayne .
DWAYNE: It was only this once , Jay . To be honest , I did n't know what to make of it . So I consulted my dream book , and found out it means this you 're my road dog . You got my back .
MORE: 17 .
JAY: In what ?
DWAYNE: In crime . And business . You see , it ai n't just about the inheritance money . It 's about what I 'm gon na do with it . Dwayne leans across the table .
JAY: Yes . I 'm totally ready .
DWAYNE: Then answer me thiswhat 's this town missing ? I 'll give you a hint . It 's a cash business , crawling with sexy bitches .
JAY: A Chinese food restaurant ?
DWAYNE: No . A tanning salon .
BEAT: Think about it . All that green . All that brown flesh . Jay nods , thinking about . He smiles .
DWAYNE: It 's also the perfect front for a prostitution ring .
JAY: Yeah , of course . Because of the booths .
DWAYNE: Yes . And because of the bitches .
BEAT: It can all be ours . 30 percent fo you , 70 percent for me . You just got ta help me out here .
DWAYNE: I 'm starting to wonder if my dream ook was wrong about you . Maybe you sitting behind me does n't mean you 're my road dog . Maybe it means you 're plotting to stab me in the back , like some snake in the grass .
JAY: That 's crazy . I 'd never do something like that . The dream book was right !
DWAYNE: Here 's a fact they do n't build prisons for criminals , they build them fo idiots . Shit , they got three different types of CSI on TV , just laying out how the police do their businessand still , idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself .
BEAT: If you wan na be a millionaire , you got ta think like one . And millionaires do n't kill people . They hire assassins . Which I did . We got ta pay him on Tuesday .
JAY: What ? Why would you do that ?
DWAYNE: I was presented with an opportunity . I took it . 100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal .
JAY: But we do n't have that kinda money .
DWAYNE: Now we 're addressing the real problem how do we get the 100 grand ? 'Cause once we get that , we get the million .
MORE: 19 .
JAY: I guess we could justrob a bank . One of these local banks with nothing ut a dipshit security guard .
DWAYNE: Again , not quite thinking like a millionaire .
JAY: Okay , then let 's hire someone to ro a bank . Dwayne thinks about this for a second .
DWAYNE: Fuck hiring them , we could just force someone to rob a bank for us . Like with blackmail , or death threats , or -
ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY: A bomb . Everyone 's scared of a bomb .
DWAYNE: I was gon na say hypnotismbut I like that . It 's out of the fucking ox . We just strap one to some motherfucker 's chest , like we did to those watermelons . Think you can you build some kinda bomb vest ?
JAY: Yeah , I meancamel jockeys do it in caves . I got a garage workshop .
DWAYNE: I 'm pretty sure this is exactly how a millionaire would do it . And the eauty of it is we do n't lose any sleep , 'cause no one gets hurt .
JAY: Except The Major .
DWAYNE: Yeah . The Major dies . But no one gets hurt .
MIND WORKING: What we need is someone to come to usto a place where we can control the situation . Someone without any connection to us .
PIZZA CHEF: We 'll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes or less ! Or your pizza is free ! Giorgio 's Trattoria , where the customer gets what they wantpronto ! The guys look at each other .
DWAYNE: Sometimes fate just takes out its cock and slaps you in the face with it .
RIGGS: I 'm hungry . I 'm gon na get something to eat .
CHET: Maybe you should pace yourself . It 's noon on a Saturday .
WILL: Fridge is full , man . We 're all good .
CHET: Yeah , he used to kick our asses .
WILL: Turns out he was probably jerking off to it afterwards . He 's gay .
CHET: I hope he chokes on a dick . I neve liked him .
WILL: Your sister did . She let him finge last her . Big time . Chet pauses the movie .
CHET: What the fuck are you talking about ? I do n't want that shit in my head .
WILL: Sorry . Kate told me about it last night . I thought you should know .
CHET: You two were swapping stories about getting fingered ? That 's pretty cute .
WILL: The point I 'm trying to make is this Tom Small was an asshole . He was totally wrong for your sister . Just like every other guy she 's ever dated . Right through to that Mark dude she 's gon na get back together with . Un-be- fuck-me-lievable
CHET: Whatever . Why the fuck are we talking about who my sister goes out with ?
WILL: Chet , I really do n't
CHET: My twin sister ! ? Which is basically like fucking me !
WILL: Hey , if you guys had that twin ESP shit this would be a completely different situation . There 'd be logistical problems .
CHET: We look exactly alike !
WILL: You look like a lot of people . You 're a normal looking dude .
CHET: This is so fucked up I ca n't even egin to process it . How long has this been going on ?
WILL: If I had to put my finger on itmiddle school-ish .
CHET: So all those sleepovers , they were just some kind of opportunity fo you to peek in Kate 's bedroom ?
WILL: It might have happened a few times . Most of them were accidental .
CHET: You 're a peeping Tom . You realize that , do n't you ? You 're a sexual fucking deviant .
WILL: Fuck you . I 'm as normal as they come . Your sister is attractive . She excites me , in a sexual way . Fucking sue me . Ca n't we just be adults about it ?
CHET: You ? An adult ? Sort of stretching the term .
WILL: Hey , let 's not say shit we ca n't take back .
CHET: Take back ? Will , you got kicked out of junior college for punching a professor that made fun of some poem you wrote .
WILL: That poem was about your sister !
CHET: That is , literally , the saddest thing I have ever heard . Like retards playing freeze tag sad . No wonde you deliver pizzas for a living .
WILL: Fuck you ! Maybe I was just hanging out with you for your sister . You were always a whiny little bitch . And you stuttered . All the kids used to call you `` Chutter . ''
CHET: Whatever . I only started hanging out with you because you had a Nintendo .
WILL: Did you see my Nintendo naked ? Because I saw your sister changing into her swimsuit at your thirteenth irthday pool party . And it was the highlight of the whole shitty event . Chet bites his lip .
CHET: Okay . You wan na do this ?
WILL: I think we already are .
CHET: Well , you know who I saw naked ? Jenny Rifkin . While I was nailing her . The week after she dumped you .
MORE: 24 .
WILL: Wowwow . You pulled a Judas on Jenny fucking Rifkin . That is messed up . Almost as messed up as how I sold you Cal Ripken signed ball for 200 bucks .
CHET: My grandpa left me that ball in his will ! You helped me look for it fo a month !
WILL: Now you know why we never found it . Will bows .
CHET: Not quite yet . There 's actually a mystery I wan na solve for you .
BEAT: I was the one who told John Tanne about how your mom fucked that lifeguard . And I always felt awful about it , because even though he swore secrecy , he told everyone else in town . And then your parents wound up getting divorced . But nowI do n't give a shit .
WILL: What ! ? You ruinedmy fucking life !
CHET: Krav Maga , bitch . I bet your poetry professor did n't know this shit .
WILL: Get offa me !
CHET: You threw the first punch !
WILL: I 'm gon na break this hold and then kick your skinny ass !
CHET: Try it !
WILL: What the fuck is that ! ?
CHET: My knuckle in your spine ! No holds arred you backstabbing fuck !
WILL: I 'm gon na pass out
CHET: Good !
WILL: I love her , ChetI love Kate
CHET: Let me tell you something . And it 's the truest thing you 'll ever hear , from the person who knows you best in the worldyou 're not good enough for my sister . And you never will e. You 're the lowest common denominator , Will . You 're the square oot of fucking zero . Will gets to his feet .
WILL: Fuck youChutter !
GRABS DICK: Square this !
CHET: Get out of my house . You 're a shitty friend .
WILL: Right back at you . Will storms out .
CHRISTOPHER: Come on , wake up and get to work .
WILL: Where the fuck is this ?
CHRISTOPHER: How should I know ? It 's 30 minutes away or the pizza comes out of you paycheck . Tick tock .
WILL: Hello ?
DWAYNE: Stop ! We got a gun , you asshole !
WILL: What the hell ! ? Rape !
DWAYNE: Step one .
CHUCKLES: Idiot . Will mumbles something through the duct tape .
DWAYNE: Just shut up . The tape is there fo a reason . 'Cause this next part is gon na take a measure of calm . Are you with me ? Can you be calm ?
JAY: Take it easy , man . You 're fine . I uilt this thing . It 's pretty stable .
DWAYNE: For a fucking bomb . So do n't trip over your shoelaces or anything . That thing 's full of C-4 . And the C is for chaos .
JAY: Actually , the C stands for `` composite . '' But , yeah , I 'd try not to slam into stuff .
DWAYNE: Can I take that tape off now , pizza boy ?
WILL: Help ! Dwayne chuckles .
DWAYNE: You know where you are ? You might as well be in space , motherfucker . Nobody can hear you scream .
WILL: Why are you doing this to me ? I do n't have any money .
DWAYNE: Not yet . But you 're gon na go get us some .
WILL: Okay . Sure , man . Whatever you say . I 'll go sell my car . I 'll get you like a thousand bucks .
DWAYNE: I want 100 thousand .
WILL: Where the fuck am I supposed to get that much money ?
DWAYNE: The Donner-Wells National Bank on Charles Road .
JAY: Across the street from the Olive Garden .
DWAYNE: Yeah , the one across the street from the Olive Garden .
WILL: Do you guys have an account o something ? Dwayne shakes his head like Will is an idiot .
DWAYNE: No , I do n't have an account ! You 're gon na rob it !
WILL: How the fuck am I supposed to rob a ank ?
DWAYNE: Figure it out . You got a bomb strapped to your chest . That 's a start . It 'll scare the fuck outta people . Maybe use your brain and go get a gun . Borrow one from a friend for all I care . It ai n't rocket science .
WILL: Then do it yourself .
DWAYNE: I would , but I 'm already wearing this gorilla mask and you 're already wearing that bomb .
TO JAY: Tell him about the vest . Jay turns to Will .
JAY: You seem like a pretty trustworthy guy . I mean , you got a job and all . But just in case you were gon na try to take the vest off , we booby trapped it to shit . There 's also a remote detonator on the back , so we can trigger it by dialing a number .
DWAYNE: And it 's on speed dial . So do what you got ta do , but we 'll be watching .
MORE: 31 .
DWAYNE: It 's 9 00 AM . You got 8 hours . He hands Will a slip of paper .
BEAT: Now let me demonstrate what happens if you do n't get us the money .
DWAYNE: Hey , Teddy Ruxpinwhat 's that ? You do n't have the money ? It was too tough to rob the bank , so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch ? Well , guess what my stuffed friendtime is up .
WILL: Guys , can we please just talk about this ?
DWAYNE: Yeah , of course we can .
JAY: What the hell , Dwayne ? You told me that was a replica gun .
DWAYNE: It was . Then I paid a Mexican 50 ucks to put a firing pin in it . Now it goes boom .
JAY: We did n't discuss a loaded gun ! Especially not with the bomb around !
DWAYNE: Do n't you ever question me . I 'm fucking this bitch . You 're just holding the camera .
JAY: Sure , Dwaynewhatever you say .
DWAYNE: Good . 'Cause this ai n't the Marines . This is cash money . You hesitate , you fuck upand I will leave you behind .
WILL: Oh , god ! Holy shit ! Fuck me ! Someone please fucking help me ! Nothing but the wind .
CHET: This whole region here , about 830 thousand square miles , was part of the initial Louisiana Purchase .
SEVENTH GRADER: Nice laser .
CHET: Take out your workbooks . Chapter 3 . Chet opens the door .
WILL: We got ta talk .
CHET: I 'm working here . Do not mess with me at work .
WILL: Chet , for the love of god , just talk to me in private for one minute . Chet sighs .
CHET: You wan na apologize , do n't you ? You look like shit . You 've probably een up for days thinking about what an asshole you were . Well , it 's gon na take a lot more than some pathetic groveling -
WILL: Chet ! Shut up ! I do n't wan na apologize to you !
CHET: Then what do you want ? Because we do n't have anything left to say to each other . Will swallows hard .
WILL: Here goes . And this is gon na sound crazy . Because it is fucking crazy . But last night two guys in masks jumped me and strapped a bomb to my chest , and now I have less than eight hours to rob a bank . Chet just stares at Will , unimpressed .
CHET: You 're hysterical . Got me . Great joke . I 'm going back to work now .
WILL: Chet , do you really think I 'm a terrorist ?
CHET: Yes ! One of the dumb ones ! The ones they convince to wear the bombs !
WILL: I am not fucking around here . Two guys did this to me . And if I do n't ob that bank in time this thing is gon na blow .
CHET: Seriously ?
WILL: Seriously .
CHET: And your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children ?
WILL: I did n't -
CHET: Just back the fuck away from me with that thing .
WILL: Listen , I think the vest is safe fo now . These guys do n't want me to low myself up on accident before I get their money .
CHET: Oh , so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe ? There 's no margin for error in their fucking omb vest design ! ?
WILL: I do n't know ! All I do know is that this is real . This is happening . And I 'm sure you hate me as much as I hate you right now , but I have nowhere else to go .
CHET: For what ?
WILL: For help , Chet . I need your help . Please . I ca n't do this alone .
CHET: Damn it ! I 'd like to tell you to get fucked , ut you know what the problem isI 'm a better man than you . And someday , I might actually forgive you . So if I let you blow up , or whatever , that shit might come back and eat at my conscience , and totally affect my elationships with other people . Like my wife and kids and shit .
WILL: That 's avery rational way to look at the situation .
GENUINELY: And you 're right , about being a bette guy than me . Chet takes a step toward Will .
CHET: Are you sure that thing is n't gon na low at any second ?
WILL: I can do that .
CHET: Yes , I 'm still here . I really am this stupid . Just pay attention to where you 're going .
WILL: I think I can handle it .
CHET: These floors get waxed once a week . On Tuesday , which today is . You hit a slick patch , trip and fall , and I got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out .
WILL: Chet , I 'm fucking nervous enough as it is . Please . I do n't need you ack seat driving me right now .
CHET: Obviously . Will stops , turns back toward Chet .
WILL: Just for the record , this is n't a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest . And there are metal lockers on eithe side of the hallway . If I fall , and if this thing goes off , I 'm probably not taking out the whole school .
CHET: Do you really want to debate this ?
WILL: Whatever . It 's over .
CHET: Kristi Evans . Why ?
WILL: You know why .
CHET: Oh , come on . Just keep walking .
WILL: Come on yourself . You knew exactly who I was talking about .
CHET: Fuck you . She 's in the eighth grade .
WILL: I bet you love it when she calls you Mr. Chet .
CHET: She does n't call me `` Mr . Chet . '' She 's not a foreigner .
WILL: This is what ?
CHET: Once I step inside this car , I 'm asically in a steel coffin with you andthat thing . And if it goes off , all they 're gon na find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb . They 'll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up . It 'll be all over the news . Next thing you now , some militia o Islam group is claiming us as members . My family will be humiliated .
WILL: We 'll also be dead , in that particula situation , so it wo n't really matter .
CHET: Exactly ! Will sighs .
WILL: I get it . Take your time , man .
CHET: This is the world 's biggest favor , you motherfucker . You did n't even help me move last winter . Chet reluctantly hops in .
WILL: Fine . Will pulls out of the school parking lot .
CHET: I have no idea . I just got in you car . I thought you had a plan .
WILL: Well , I do n't ! I 've been sorta preoccupied with this crushing fea of death !
CHET: No plan . I ca n't say I 'm surprised .
WILL: Your plan is probably better . Just condescend me until I explode .
CHET: Maybe we should turn on the radio . See if the signal sets the bomb off . That would be an interesting experiment . Will heaves a frustrated sigh . Chet eases up .
WILL: Unless we have to .
CHET: Holy fucking shit !
WILL: Stop it ! You 're scaring the fuck out of me !
CHET: Okay . Okay . Fuck ! Chet makes the sign of the cross .
WILL: Why did you do that ?
CHET: Do what ?
WILL: I saw you .
CHET: It 's in case I have to jump out .
WILL: If I survive the day , and you do n't ecause you jumped out of a moving car and broke your neck , I 'm gon na laugh my ass off .
CHET: And if abandoning ship saves my life , then that laugh will be mine . The guys continue driving in silence . SUPER COUNTDOWN 6 hours , 59 minutes
WILL: It 's too tight ! He is calling off toward the
CHET: What if we try to separate you shoulder ?
WILL: This is pointless . Chet shuts his laptop .
CHET: I agree . We got ta call the cops , have them fly in the bomb squad o something .
WILL: We ca n't . These guys said they 'd be following me . And I do n't have a clue what they look like . For all I know , they 're outside right now . They see the cops show up , they blow the vest and cut their losses . Will stares at Chet , hopelessly overwhelmed .
CHET: I do n't know , WillI guess you got ta rob the bank .
WILL: I have n't been inside a bank in three years ! How the fuck am I supposed to rob one ! ? They would n't even give me a savings account !
CHET: It 's gon na be okay .
WILL: No , it 's not ! I 'm gon na blow up ! That 's way worse than getting stabbed or shot . At least some people survive that . No one survives being blown up .
MORE: 43 .
CHET: Pull yourself together !
WILL: Ow ! Fuck ! I think you popped my eardrum .
CHET: Sorry . Shit . I did n't mean to do that . But just listen to me now . You 're not gon na die . You wan na know why ? Because you know exactly how to rob a bank .
WILL: What are you talking about ?
CHET: Point Break .
WILL: The movie ?
CHET: Yes . That movie is like a how-to guide for bank robberies . You just ust in . Masks . Guns . Move fast . Stick to the tellers and do n't bothe with the vault .
WILL: YeahI guess it 's pretty simple , ight ? And it 's just a local bank . The Donner-Wells on Charles Road .
CHET: Really ? I applied for a job there like a year ago .
WILL: You wanted to be a teller ?
CHET: Yeah , so what ? It 's a good job . You get benefits .
WILL: Like what , a name tag ?
CHET: What kind of benefits do you get ? Free toppings ?
WILL: That 's really clever . No one eve said that shit to me before . Anyway , this is perfect . You know the whole layout of the bank .
CHET: Not exactly . They did n't hand me the security schematics with the application . But I sat in the waiting area for like 20 minutes . I know what the place looks like .
WILL: How many guards ?
CHET: One . I think .
WILL: That 's a start .
CHET: It 's a great start . You can do it . Will pauses .
WILL: You 're gon na do it with me , right ?
CHET: I was actually gon na stick to giving tips , ideasmotivational speeches . More of a consultant or advisory role .
WILL: Jesus Christ , Chet . Please . I 'm egging you here . I need you on this . If I do it alone , I 'm dead .
CHET: Are you gon na cry again ?
WILL: That was a moment of weakness .
BEAT: Yes . I 'll fucking cry again if that 's what it takes .
CHET: I should make you blow me .
WILL: Sure . Whip that shit out . I 'm actually kinda curious . I wan na see if Jenny Rifkin lied to you . She obviously lied to me . Chet cracks a smile .
CHET: We 're gon na rob a bank for 100 grand ? Just leave the rest of the money sitting there ? Why ?
WILL: I do n't know . I guess they 're very modest criminals . Who the fuck cares ? Waityou said `` we '' right ? Chet heaves a sigh .
CHET: I 'm putting my life on the line fo 100 grandwhat does 100 grand even uy these days ?
JUICY: I missed you so much , baby .
VAUGHN: You do n't got enough dicks to keep you warm in that place ?
JUICY: You know it 's not like that . Those guys get Juicy , but you get Marisol .
VAUGHN: Well , Marisolwhat I want is to get my money , kill that old ass man , then get the fuck out of here .
JUICY: Then that 's how it 's gon na go . We 're just waiting on a call . Vaughn stares at her .
VAUGHN: This is my impatient face .
JUICY: Well , I think I can keep you entertained .
WILL: Should we go with the handgunso the Uzis ?
CHET: Handguns .
WILL: That 's such a Murtaugh choice .
REGISTER WOMAN: You sure you do n't want to grab some condoms ?
WILL: Uh , no . Why ?
REGISTER WOMAN: Because this is usually what men buy efore they rape someone , and I want to make sure you all use protection .
WILL: Lady , we 're justbuying some stuff .
REGISTER WOMAN: Is that cash or credit for your rape kit ?
CHET: We 'll pay cash .
DWAYNE: You really fucked up this mix tape .
JAY: Sorry , Dwayne . That song just means a lot to me .
DWAYNE: I wish he would hurry his shit up .
JAY: You worried about that other guy he 's with ?
DWAYNE: No , man . He picked him up at a school . So long as there ai n't any cops , he can take the whole town with him . I just want my money .
JAY: What ? You want me to run over to Subway , get us a couple sandwiches ?
DWAYNE: If you had any vision , Jay , you 'd know exactly what I 'm thinking about ight now . And it 's not a sandwich .
BEAT: Look how well trafficked that shopping mall is . It 's the perfect place fo the tanning salon . Jay checks it out , nods .
JAY: Oh , you 're totally right .
DWAYNE: I 've been thinking about it , and I want you to start off working the counter . Sounds like a demotion , I know , but it 's an important position . Because we 're gon na be using code words and shit . For example , if a customer walks in and says he wants a tan , that just means he wants a tan . But if he says he wants a `` deluxe tan , '' that means a blow job and you got ta get one of the girls in there to suck him off . You with me ?
JAY: So far . But what if he wants a fuck ?
DWAYNE: There 's gon na be codes for everything missionary , anal , black chicks . I got it all written down back home in my files .
MORE: 49 .
JAY: Okay . 'Cause they 're about to get away . Dwayne spots the Mustang pulling away .
DWAYNE: Fuck . He throws the van into gear .
WILL: Be careful , you 're getting paint everywhere .
CHET: Are you really worried about you upholstery right now ?
WILL: Yes , because if I survive this shit I 'm quitting my job . That means I 'll probably have to give up my place and I 'll be sleeping in the ack of my car , which you 're covering in toxic paint .
CHET: It says it 's fast drying .
WILL: Fast is n't the same as instant . You got ta let it sit for like 20 minutes .
CHET: How would you know ? You do a lot of graffiti ?
WILL: No , but I spray painted my bike last year after I got my license suspended . I did n't let it dry properly and I fucked it up .
CHET: We do n't have time to sit around and literally watch paint dry . Are n't we going straight to the bank ?
WILL: I was actually thinking we need to stop and steal a car first . Chet drops the spray paint , whirls on Will .
CHET: What ? No way ! We 've got a car .
WILL: Yeah , my car . I 'm not gon na use it as a getaway vehicle . They can trace the plates . Even if we do get away , we 'll be arrested .
CHET: Well , I ca n't hotwire a fucking automobile , and neither can you .
WILL: That 's why I was thinking we 'd steal one from your parents ' friends . The Fishers . Remember how they used to pay us to clean their garage ? They leave the keys in there . And they have a Datsun . That 's a fast car .
CHET: I 'm not stealing the Fishers ' Datsun . Let 's steal a car from your parents ' friends .
WILL: What friends ? My parents do n't have any . My dad moved away after you ig mouth ruined his marriage and humiliated him , and no one wanted to hang out with the mom who everyone knew fucked a lifeguard .
CHET: You never should have told me ! I was 13 years old . I could n't process that kind of information . I had to tell someone else . Fuck . I really am sorry about it . Okay ? Despite what I said before . I was just a kid , but I messed up .
WILL: Okay . Chet looks at Will , expectantly .
CHET: That 's it ? You 're not gon na apologize for selling my Cal Ripken ball ?
WILL: Sure . I 'm sorryI 'm sorry that my family was going through a rough patch and I was smoking a ton of weed and listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the time . And that I needed some extra dough to indulge my habit . Which , in hindsight , was probably just a cry for help . But you never even noticed .
CHET: Thanks . Now I feel even worse .
WILL: I should n't have stolen the ball . I knew it was wrong and I regretted it like the next day . I actually tried to buy it back but the guy wanted twice as much . I had to smoke even more weed just to get past the whole shitty incident . I guess that 's why they call it a downward spiral .
CHET: I appreciate that you tried to buy it back . So , thanks . An awkward moment passes .
WILL: The keys are n't here . They always used to leave the keys out .
CHET: Yeah . When we were teenagers . This is fucked .
WILL: Let 's just find them .
CHET: Sorry .
WILL: What ?
CHET: Mr. Fisher is coming ! As he looks for an escape -
WILL: No !
CHET: What are you doing ?
WILL: I 'm doing what I have to .
MR. FISHER: Oh , Jesus !
WILL: Where are the car keys ?
MR. FISHER: They 're in my pocket ! I 'm just eaching in my pocket for the keys !
WILL: Quiet down and do it already .
MR. FISHER: Sure . Anything you say .
WILL: If you fuck with us , I swear , I willI will shoot your son . Taylor . I know where he works . At the fucking travel agency . He 's the douchebag with the bangs .
MR. FISHER: Please no . I wo n't do anything . I wo n't . Just leave Taylor alone .
WILL: I 'm gon na trust you . But if you call the police , there 's gon na be an undertaker styling his stupid fucking angs !
BEAT: Now open the garage door .
WILL: The car 's insured , right ? Mr. Fisher nods .
MR. FISHER: Please , just go . Will slides into the car and starts it up .
CHET: That old man 's got a heart condition ! You could have killed him !
WILL: My hand was forced ! Chet tries to get comfortable in the seat .
CHET: Awesome . I 'm stuck inside an even smaller car with you and a bomb .
WILL: This thing 's got some pickup .
CHET: Could you just take it easy , we 're doing fine on time .
WILL: I knowbut there 's one last stop we have to make .
CHET: Do you have to take a piss first ? Because I do .
WILL: I need to see your sister .
CHET: Are you for real ? Did you really just ask me that ? You salt-in-an- open-wound motherfucker !
WILL: Chet , as if it is n't apparent , I may die today . I 'll probably die today . And if there 's one small thing that 's clear to me now , it 's that I 've wasted two and a half decades as a pussy , watching everything I want pass me y. I do n't wan na peace out of this world as a pussy . I need to tell her how I feel .
CHET: You 're really gon na turn this into some sort of dying wish bullshit ?
WILL: Yes , I really am . It means that much to me . I am not fucking around here .
CHET: I do n't think you are . I mean , apparently , you love my sister so much that you 're willing to put he life in danger by going to see he with a bomb strapped to your chest .
WILL: She wo n't be in danger . I promise . I got it all worked out . And you can even take a piss while I 'm inside .
DWAYNE: Where the fuck is he going ? What 's in there ? Some sort of FBI headquarters ? I told that guy not to fuck around !
JAY: No ! Let me just go see what he 's up to . Dwayne smirks .
DWAYNE: I was just fucking around . Are you gay for this guy or something ?
JAY: I just wan na get the money , Dwayne . Same as you .
DWAYNE: All right . Then man up and go check it out . As Jay reaches for the door handle -
JAY: I do n't knowI 'm from the telephone company ?
DWAYNE: Yeah , nice fucking uniform .
WILL: no , I 'm here right now .
OVER PHONE: Why are you acting so strange ?
WILL: Because strange shit is going on . I 'll explain everything . Just meet me where I texted you .
KATE: Will ?
WILL: Stop !
KATE: What are you doing ?
WILL: Just do n't come any closer .
KATE: Why not ? What 's going on ?
WILL: I 'm gon na give you the short version of an incredibly complicated and fucked up situation , so please be cool .
BEAT: Some very bad guys strapped a bom to my chest and they are forcing me to commit a crime .
KATE: Will , I swear , if this is -
WILL: I wish I was joking , but I 'm not . I know it 's a lot to swallow , but you got ta take it on face value , because there 's a timer attached to this thing and it 's counting down . Kate 's voice falters -
KATE: Oh my god , Willwe 'll get help . I 'll get you help .
WILL: I did n't come here for help . I 'm taking care of it . I came here ecause , should things not work out today as I would like them to , I want you to know why I was doing the things I did .
KATE: Please , just let me call someone . Let me do something . This is crazy !
WILL: I do n't disagree with you . It 's fucking nuts . But that 's not even what this is about .
STRUGGLING: Do you remember when you found that picture in my car of you , me and Chet , with Chet cut out of it ?
KATE: Will , I ca n't remember about some stupid picture while you 're -
WILL: I need you to remember about the picture , and about how I stop by your office every Friday , and how I 've always hated all your boyfriends , and how the two girls I 've eve seriously dated have looked like less attractive versions of you .
BEAT: Do you see where I 'm going with this ? I love you Kate . I have for a very long time . Kate is barely holding it together .
KATE: Will , this is a lot you 're putting on me ! You just told me people are trying to kill you or something , and now you say you love me . What the fuck is going on ?
WILL: A whole lot of shit . I 'm sorry to do this to you , but I was afraid I 'd neve get the chance to tell you . And I know you have feelings for me , too . Maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend , or - if the world fucking hates me - a brother .
MORE: 60 .
KATE: Yes . I mean , I 've known you forever . It 's not an easy thing to figure out .
WILL: I do n't need an answer now . Just think about it . And no matter what you decide , you 're too good fo assholes like Mark and the rest of them . Kate manages a small , stifled laugh .
KATE: Okay . I will process all of this . It 's just , the bomb -
WILL: It 's distracting . I know . Anyway , I 'd love to stay and talk some more , ut I ca n't . I got ta ask you to leave now , because I 'm running out of time .
KATE: If I had time to think about itI 'd probably tell you that I 've always felt very strongly for you . And I 've never thought of you as a brother . Will smiles , yells back -
WILL: That 's a huge relief . Do n't say anything else . I just really do n't want to die now .
KATE: Try not to . Please . Kate turns and continues to the access door .
JAY: I 'm , uhI 'm a personal shopper . I 'm looking for Mr. Quilby .
KATE: I 'm sorry , I do n't know who that is .
DWAYNE: So ?
JAY: It was just his girlfriend or something .
DWAYNE: Getting one last blow job in case he do n't make it . I kinda like this guy .
CHET: Did you tell her how you saw her naked when she was 13 ? That always works .
WILL: I said my piece . She 's gon na think about it .
CHET: Shut up . She was freaked out .
WILL: Yes . By the bomb .
CHET: By you .
WILL: Would it be so bad if we ended up together ? You and I would be family .
CHET: I do n't want you in the family . You ing very little to the table . I want her to be with someone awesome . A pro quarterback . A war hero . At the very least , someone I 've neve watched porn with .
WILL: Well , now it 's up to her .
CHET: Not if I set that bomb off myself .
WILL: Then you 'd probably never get to ro a bank . Will throws the car into gear and pulls away . SUPER COUNTDOWN 4 hours , 10 minutes
CHET: I 'm not feeling so good . I drank like three of those 5-Hour Energy drinks .
WILL: It 's just nerves . Let 's pull ou shit together and do this thing .
CHET: What should I call you in there , like if I need to ask you to do something ?
WILL: Call me Tivon . You 'll be Darius .
CHET: I can tell you 're not a black guy through the ski mask .
WILL: Fine . Then you 'll be Luis and I 'm Cruz . We 're two loco motherfuckers and that 's the way we got ta roll when we get in there .
CHET: No , get on the ground !
WILL: Actually , listen to him and get on the fucking ground !
SECURITY GUARD: Just take it easy , man !
WILL: Do n't be a hero , cowboy !
SECURITY GUARD: What the fuck does that mean ? I 'm not a hero ! Or a cowboy !
CHET: All of you , back away from the counte and get out here ! Anyone pushes a utton and one of these people gets totally shot !
WILL: Very slowly , take out your gun and toss it away .
MOM: Oh , god ! I do n't want the gun !
WILL: What the fuck ! ? Did you do that on purpose ! ?
SECURITY GUARD: It was an accident !
CHET: Are you guys working together ?
MOM: No ! Please take this gun away !
WILL: Just toss it , lady !
FAT MAN: I think she got the femoral artery !
MOM: I 'm sorry ! It was an accident !

MOM: Christi , be quiet . These men are dangerous .
CHET: This is fucked . That dude is gon na leed out and we 're gon na go to prison .

WILL: Point taken . Luis , how we doing on the money ? Chet snaps back to attention -
CHET: Oh , shit . Sorry , Cruz .
FAT MAN: My leg really hurts !
WILL: Can you please hurry up , Sandra ! ?
CHET: What the fuck was that about , Sandra ? I thought we had something going ! What happened to trust ?
SANDRA: I 'm sorry ! They make us do it !
WILL: Could you kindly fill another bag ? Not a bank bag . A fucking garbage ag . And Luis , will you watch he this time ?
CHET: Okay . That should be enough .
WILL: Fuck ! Which one of you assholes tripped the alarm ! ? Was it you , Sandra ! ?
SANDRA: No ! It was Mark ! He pushed the utton when you guys came in !
MARK: Sandra , you bitch ! Now they 're gon na kill us both !
SANDRA: Fuck you , Mark ! You 're the manager ! Will loses his shit -
WILL: Fuck both of you ! Fuck all of you ! I 'm a regular guy ! Just like you ! I 'm a regular guy and you fucked me ! Thank you for fucking a regular guy !
CHET: Let 's just get the fuck out of here . The guys slam through the doors , out into
OFFICER ZURMAN: Drop your weapons !
CHET: Do n't shoot us !
OFFICER ZURMAN: Drop the guns or I 'll have to !
WILL: Fuck you ! You just brought a gun to a bomb fight , officer ! I pull these wires out and we all go ! You got ten seconds to drop your gun and -
CHET: That was awesome .
WILL: He was tempting a desperate motherfucker .
DWAYNE: Holy shit ! Our boy is causing some serious mayhem !
JAY: He 's gon na get caught or killed .
DWAYNE: Shut the fuck up ! If you jinx this with your negativity , I 'm gon na strap a bomb to your chest next . Jay massages his shoulder , pissed .
JAY: Oh , yeah , who 's gon na build it ?
DWAYNE: You are !
CHET: Shit ! This is not cool !
WILL: I can outrun these guys . They 're not the FBI , they 're local cops . Just shut up and let me concentrate . I do this for a living . As they clip the side-view mirror off a Kia -
CHET: You do n't do anything like this for a living ! I am not a pizza , I am a man !
WILL: Holy fuck !
CHET: Go ! Go ! Go !
WILL: That guy got fucked up .
WILL: Chet ? Are you okay ? Chet ! ?
CHET: Oh my god

CHET: I thought you were gon na blow up . Will 's hands go to the bombstill intact .

DWAYNE: You hear what happened to the guys they were after ?
RANDOM LOCAL: Sounds like they got away . Dwayne and Jay beam .
WILL: I never thought I 'd see you again .
CHET: I thought you hated this car .
WILL: It 's actually not that bad . You know , as compared to that Datsun . The Mustang 's got more comfortable seats . And it never would have flipped over .
CHET: I told a bunch of people I was gon na shoot someone . I was like `` you fucking move , and I will kill you where you stand ! ''
WILL: I threatened to blow up a cop .
BEAT: And you never said `` I will kill you where you stand . ''
CHET: I know . But shit did get pretty crazy .
WILL: Yeah , it did . Will starts to get a little emotional .
CHET: Me , neither .
WILL: And as for all that shit I saidand all that shit I didI hope you can forgive me . We 've been friends fo so long , and I guess you hurt the people you 're closest to the most .
CHET: I messed up , too . I 'm a dude who slept with his best friend 's ex- girlfriend , and destroyed his parents ' marriage , and sat on the sidelines watching his downward spiral . I 'm a shitty human being . But I 'm glad you know that now , because you can accept me for who I am .
WILL: I do . I accept you . Because you accept me .
CHET: Woah ! You still got a bomb on you .
WILL: You 're right . Let 's take care of that . But you owe me a hug .
DWAYNE: This who I think it is ?
WILL: We killed a cop .
CHET: You were driving ! I 'm just an accomplice !
WILL: They 're gon na hunt us down and kill us . Cops do n't take this shit lightly .
CHET: I bet he had like eight kids . We have to find them and support his family forever .
DWAYNE: I 'm just messin ' with you . You did n't kill anyone . How 'd a moron like you manage to rob a bank ?
JAY: You know , I 've been pretty low , too if you ever want to talk about that kinda stuff .
DWAYNE: No . I do n't . My whole point I was trying to make before you interrupted me was that that shit is all in the past . 'Cause I did it . I finally pulled it off .
JAY: We pulled it off , Dwayne . The two us . We 're a good team .
DWAYNE: Are we ? Would you do anything to protect me , my money , my empire ?
JAY: Yeah , sure
NERVOUS: I mean , like what kinda stuff are we talking about ?
DWAYNE: Would you push the button ?
JAY: Why would you want me to do that ?
DWAYNE: It 's just a question , Jay . Would you ? If I asked you ?
MORE: 79 .
JAY: Watermelons are n't alive .
DWAYNE: Yeah , they are . Not the ones you lew up , though . Dwayne stares hard at Jay . A tense beat .
JAY: No one gets hurtright , Dwayne ?
DWAYNE: Oh , yeah . I forgot about that part . Dwayne cracks a smile .
WILL: Where are the other guys ?
VAUGHN: I 'm the only guy .
BEAT: You got it ?
VAUGHN: What the fuck did you dorob a ank ?
WILL: Yes . Vaughn grins .
VAUGHN: I do n't have any code .
WILL: Listen , man , I just want the code .
VAUGHN: I do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about .
WILL: The code for the fucking bomb !
VAUGHN: What kind of stupid motherfucke wears a bomb to a drop ?
WILL: Your boss put this on me .
VAUGHN: I am my boss .
WILL: Then give me the code !
VAUGHN: Motherfucker , I do n't know no goddamn code . Whoever told you I did , lied to you . Now step the fuck off , o I 'll shoot you in the face so you do n't explode and mess up my boots .
WILL: If you do n't have the code , I want that money back .
VAUGHN: The only way you 're getting this money back is if you kill me .
WILL: You do n't know what I 've gone through for that money !
VAUGHN: Do I look sympathetic ? Now step the fuck aside .
JUICY: Vaughn , look out !
WILL: Let 's go !
CHET: They tried to screw us . You 're a liability . They were just gon na let you blow up .
WILL: Not with the money they wo n't .
DWAYNE: Never comes out this nice when I do it myself . You might wan na take some more off the top , though . I wan na look real professional when I go down to the morgue to identify the body .
WILL: No ! I 've still got the money ! And I cracked your friend 's face open !
DWAYNE: I gave him the code . He told me he committed it to memory .
MORE: 83 .
DWAYNE: Hold on there , big man . You got a omb on you . I got a cell phone that detonates it . You 're not exactly negotiating from a position of leverage .
CHET: Do n't tell him to push the button ! Pull over ! Pull over ! Dwayne is getting pissed off .
DWAYNE: Why do n't you watch what the fuck you say ! I own you ! I tell you to ob a bank , and you rob a bank . I tell you to give me the money , and you give me the goddamn money and hope I show you some mercy .
CHET: Get me out of this car !
WILL: It was a negotiation tactic . He 'll call back and I wo n't answer . Then he 'll call back and I will answer , and he 'll realize the only way he gets the money is if he gives me the code .
CHET: Sure ! That seems like a perfectly logical pattern of thought ! I bet that 's exactly what he 'll do !
DWAYNE: Does this guy know who the fuck I am ! ?
JAY: Dwayneyou never told me you were n't going to give him the code .
DWAYNE: We 're not amateurs . He was a loose end . I let him live , someday I woulda een walking out of my mansion and am ! FBI , CIA , NSA , all converging on my front lawn , 'cause a loose end turned state 's evidence and they got what they need to put me away .
JAY: Do n't do it . Dwayne looks down at the send button .
DWAYNE: You know what they say about a tree falling in the forest ? Maybe the same thing applies to blowing up some motherfucker across town . Maybe it does n't even make a sound . Dwayne hits send .
JAY: Gina Kim . My seventh grade crush . O whoever lives in Gina Kim 's house now .
DWAYNE: Where 's the number for the bomb ?
JAY: In my head . I switched it out of your phone while you were taking a shit . You 're out of control , Dwayne .
DWAYNE: I 'm in perfect control !
JAY: Stop it !
DWAYNE: You assholeI make you my partne and you pull this shit
JAY: I 'm tired of you pushing me around all the time ! What kinda partne does that ! ?
DWAYNE: Fuck youI 'm gon na piss blood , are n't I ?
JAY: That 's what it said on the internet . Dwayne 's phone rings in his pocket .
DWAYNE: Go on . Get it out for me . I can arely move .
VAUGHN: Who the fuck do you think you 're talking to ! ?
DWAYNE: That guy 's not my boy . He 's a dick . I 'm sorry for all the , uh , confusion .
DELICATELY: I just want to put this out there , to keep you in the loopbut I may need to bump the hit . Vaughn paces , furious .
VAUGHN: This is n't a reservation at Sizzler ! You do n't `` bump '' it ! I want you to ing me my money right now , to where I am standing in this shit hole town , leeding from the motherfucking face !
JUICY: He lives with his daddy . You already got the address .
DWAYNE: That 's it . The assassin 's gon na kill me now . I 'm gon na die . Game fucking over .
JAY: We can still get him the money . Try the pizza guy back .
DWAYNE: Why ? So he can fuck around again , and I wind up dead , anyway ? No . I 'd rather just sit here . I want to die right here on this couch .
JAY: No . We 're gon na get that money . Just like we planned . All we got ta do is get the leverage back .
DWAYNE: How do we do that ? Pizza boy 's obviously got some kinda death wish . Jay gathers his resolve .
JAY: We take the girl . The one he went to see . Then he wo n't try shit .
DWAYNE: That 's actuallythat 's a great fucking idea , Jay . It 's the best idea anyone 's had all day .
JAY: I was just trying to figure out how you would do it , Dwayne .
DWAYNE: Ok. Then let 's do it right . We leave nothing to chance . Because if we go to prison for this , I wo n't be able to watch out for you .
JAY: Ok , Dwayne .
DWAYNE: You should probably bring the flamethrower , buddy . There 's gon na e some evidence to dispose of .
CHET: It 's been half an hour .
WILL: He 'll call .
CHET: In another 30 minutes I 'm calling the bomb squad .
WILL: You know , even if they get the bom squad here in time , and they can somehow get this thing off me , we still got ta answer for the robbery .
CHET: I 'll take the heat with you , Will .
WILL: Nah . I 'll tell them I forced you into it . That you did n't have a choice .
CHET: Thanks , man .
WILL: That 's it ? You 're not gon na think about it a little longer ? After all we went throughtear down the elationship , rebuild ityou 're gon na let me go to prison alone ?
CHET: You offered .
WILL: It was a test . Your grade F minus . You know what the `` F '' is for ?
CHET: To fuck myself ?
WILL: You passed that test . Failed the important one . As the guys continue to argue - SUPER COUNTDOWN 1 hour , 28 minutes
DWAYNE: What 's the quietest way out of the uilding ? 'Cause I might get excited in a confrontation , and you might wind up shot in the face .
MAJOR: Dwayne ?
VAUGHN: I 'm looking for your son .
MAJOR: Even if I knew where he was , I would n't tell you nothing .
VAUGHN: Do n't be stupid .
MAJOR: You know , I saved a black man 's life in the shit . So if I took yours I 'd e even .
VAUGHN: I see where your son gets his common sense .
MORE: 92 .
VAUGHN: Just tell me where he is ! Vaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun .
MAJOR: You think I 'm scared of death ? There 's a whole generation of gooks that think I 'm the grim reaper .
VAUGHN: What now , old man ! ? You ca n't kill me ! None of y'all can kill me !
MAJOR: Go on and -
VAUGHN: Motherfucker has lost his mind
CHET: Look at the upshot , while you 're ehind bars you can finally finish your degree . If I was there , too , it would just be a distraction .
WILL: Great idea , Chet . Thanks a lot . I 'll just sit here and figure out a fucking major .
DWAYNE: Yeah , I 'm ready to talk . I want my money . Meet me back at the radio tower in 50 minutes .
WILL: What the fuck is that supposed to mean ?
DWAYNE: There are no lines ! There 's just me and you and 100 thousand dollars . Once we get that shit in order , you can have her back , and your life , too . So you 're gon na show up where I say , when I say . Alone . And if you try anything stupid , the two of you will be delivering pizzas to Saint Peter .
WILL: Let me talk to her .
DWAYNE: You got ten seconds .
KATE: Will ?
DWAYNE: She 's just really gon na die if you fuck this up .
WILL: Fuck !
CHET: What happened ?

CHET: What the fuck does that mean ! ?
WILL: They took her , man . They must have followed us to her office .
CHET: Damn it ! You had to go see her !
WILL: I 'm sorry . I messed upI finally messed up worse than I could have possibly imagined .
CHET: We got ta get her back , Will . These guys are crazy .
WILL: We still got the money . As long as we have that , she 's alive . Come on .
WILL: I 'm here !
DWAYNE: How much time you got left ?
WILL: Ten minutes .
DWAYNE: Damn . Maybe we should just wait around for the money shot .
WILL: Maybe . Where 's the girl ? Dwayne grins .
DWAYNE: In the van . Maybe .
WILL: Get her out here . You 're wasting time . Will grips the bag close to him .
KATE: Will , are you there ?
WILL: I 'm here . It 's gon na be okay .
DWAYNE: This is a fucking tearjerker .
WILL: Just let her come over here .
DWAYNE: I will . But you should know , my associate over there is packing a flamethrower .
JAY: Just do what we say . Do n't mess around or anything .
DWAYNE: Unless either of you can outrun a 25- foot flame . Or a bullet .
WILL: Get back .
DWAYNE: I gave you the girl . Now give me the money .
WILL: How about we get the code out of the way first , since this bomb happens to be ticking so close to all of us .
DWAYNE: Fair enough . Dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket .
WILL: Just give it to me !
DWAYNE: 448921 .
JAY: Yeah . It 's awesome .
DWAYNE: Okay , you can get out of here now .
WILL: I actually have this sneaking suspicion that once we turn around , you 're gon na put a bullet in both of our backs - and this is just a guess - urn our bodies .
DWAYNE: They say great minds think alike . And in this case , so do we .
WILL: I figured as much . That 's why I got a gun pointed at you , too .
LOUDLY: I got a sniper in the bushes locked on you right now .
DWAYNE: Do I look that dumb ?
WILL: I ca n't tell , you 're wearing a mask .
JAY: Heyon your forehead .
DWAYNE: Son of a bitch . Well played .
WILL: We 're gon na walk out of here now . If you shoot , my sniper shoots . I ca n't guarantee he 'll get both of you . But he 'll definitely get you . As Will turns away -
VAUGHN: Was n't expecting to see you here .
DWAYNE: It 's all good . We got your money .
VAUGHN: Nice mask , Dwayne . Now throw the money over here .
DWAYNE: Hold up . You do n't have to do this . I just paid you .
VAUGHN: I 've been hit with a pipe , shot with a pen , and wasted my whole motherfucking dayall because of you and this job .
DWAYNE: I do n't know what you 're talking about . Just take the money .
VAUGHN: I will . And then I 'm gon na tie up the two loose ends in the gorilla masks .
DWAYNE: I 'm not a loose end !
VAUGHN: You 're a fucking idiot . You are as loose as ends get .
KATE: Chet ! ? What are you doing here ! ?
CHET: Not now . We got ta take off .
LOOKS AROUND: Where 's Will ?
WILL: I got the money . Let 's get the fuck out of here . They take off toward Will 's car .
DWAYNE: No ! !
JAY: Dwayne ! Help !
DWAYNE: Goddamn it , Jay !
JAY: You came back for meyou said you never would .
DWAYNE: You did n't hesitate back there , Jay . You did good .
JAY: Yeah . Go get him .
KATE: UhI just got kidnapped .
CHET: Yeah , that was totally Will 's fault . In case you want to factor that in while you 're mulling over the whole elationship thing .
WILL: I 'm very sorry about the kidnapping . This is me , taking responsibility for it . Growing up . Like a viable life partner .
CHET: This man has spied on you in the nude before !
WILL: What ? No , I did n't .
CHET: He 's lying . He 's trying to build a elationship on a foundation of lies . And it wo n't stand .
KATE: I just got kidnapped ! Can we talk about that ! ?
WILL: Oh , shit . One of those dudes is definitely not dead !
CHET: Hurry up ! He 's already on us !
DWAYNE: I own this town . Before Dwayne can get a shot off -
KATE: What the hell was that ?
WILL: That was the bomb I carried around all day . I reactivated it and put it in the back of his van . I guess his time was up .
CHET: `` His time was up ? '' Were you thinking that up the whole day ?
WILL: I was prepared , yes . I ca n't help it if I 'm the kind of guy who thinks about the future .
CHET: He 's not that kind of guy . He does n't think about the future . Ever .
KATE: What exactly happened since I saw you this afternoon ?
WILL: Primarily , we robbed a bank .
KATE: What ! ? So you 're , like , fugitives ? What do we do now ?
CHET: Yeah , Will . What does the future hold ?
WILL: Nothing good if we stay in town and they pin this on us . Kate , I think you should put in for that vacation time . Right now . If anyone gives you a problem , tell them to fuck off . There 's 100 grand in that trash ag by your feet . A third of it 's yours .
KATE: Will , that 's -
CHET: Fucked up . Why does she get a share ?
WILL: Why do you get a share ?
DWAYNE: Dad ?
MAJOR: Dwayne
DWAYNE: What happened to you ?
MAJOR: Some guysaid you hired him to kill me .
DWAYNE: Dad , II 'd never
MAJOR: Look at youlip quivering like you 're getting fuckedbe a man .

MAJOR: Hell of thingI think I mayactually respect you now .
DWAYNE: Get up , you pussy ! Come on , soldier !
CHET: Fucking nine dollars to use the internet .
WILL: And ?
CHET: Police think it was that black guy . They found some kind of map in his car . And I 'm sure racial profiling played a part .
WILL: But nothing about us ?
CHET: Nope . Guess it 's time to head back .
WILL: I was thinking we 'd stick around a little a longer .
CHET: Why ? So you have more time to delude my sister ?
WILL: Yes . And it 'd be easier if you gave us five fucking minutes alone . Chet stares out at the ocean for a beat .
CHET: You really think she 's into you ?
WILL: I kissed her last night . No tongue . Then you walked in . Chet just nods . Will gets up .
CHET: You 're gon na go fuck my sister now , are n't you ?
WILL: I 'll be thinking of you the whole time .
CHET: At the very leastbe a considerate lover . Give pleasure , before taking pleasure .

SUKEFORTH: A plan 's always good , Mr. Rickey . And you always got one .
RICKEY: My wife says I 'm too old , That my health is n't up to it . My son says that every one in baseball will be against me . But I 'm going to do it .
SUKEFORTH: Do what , Mr. Rickey ?
RICKEY: I 'm going to bring a Negro allplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers .
PARROTT: With all due respect , sir , have you lost your mind ? Imagine the abuse you 'll take from the newspapers alone . Never mind how it 'll play on Flatbush . Please , Mr. Rickey .
RICKEY: There 's no law against it , Clyde .
SUKEFORTH: There 's a code . Break a law and get away with it , some people think you 're smart . Break an unwritten law though , you 'll be an outcast .
RICKEY: So be it . New York is full of Negro baseball fans ; every dolla is green . I do n't know who he is , or where he is , but he 's coming .
CATCHER: Where 'd you learn to move like that , runner ? ! At dime a dance night ? ! Stay quiet ! INSERT Birmingham , Alabama . April 8 , 1945 .

SUKEFORTH: Satchel Paige then . Parrott enters carrying an armful of files .
RICKEY: Too old . We need a man with a future not a past . ( holds up his own
FILE: Here . Jack Roosevelt Robinson .
RICKEY: A four sport college man , out of UCLA . That means he 's played with white boys .
SCANS FILE: Twenty-six years old , now with the Kansas City Monarchs . Batting ove 350 even as we speak . 350 ! And he was a commissioned army officer !
SUKEFORTH: He was court-martialed . A trouble maker . He argues with umpires . A quick temper is his reputation . Rickey is obviously keen on him .
PARROT: What was he court-martialed for ?
RICKEY: For refusing to sit in the back of a military bus . Ft . Hood , Texas . The driver asked him to move back . The MPs had to take him off .
SUKEFORTH: Do you see ?
RICKEY: I see he resents segregation . If he were white , we 'd call it spirit !
PARROT: If he were white , sir , we would n't e looking for him . Rickey ends the debate
RICKEY: Robinson 's a Methodist . I 'm a Methodist . God 's a Methodist . We ca n't go wrong . Find him . Bring him here .
ATTENDANT: Fill her up ?
DRIVER: Yes , sir .
ATTENDANT: Where you all headed ?

JACK: Excuse me ?
RICKEY: A man needs a family relying on him . It insures he 'll behave esponsibly . Do you have a girl ?
JACK: I think so .
RICKEY: You think so ?
JACK: I do n't make much money . Between the army and now baseball I 've been away a lot . And Rae , Rachel , she wants to finish school . Considering all that , I say I think so .
RICKEY: Do you love her ? Rachel ?
JACK CONFUSED: Do n't you know ?
JACK: Yes , sir , very much .
RICKEY: Marry her .
JACK: Coach Sukeforth here said you were starting a new Negro League . That does n't make sense to me .
MR. RICKEY: It does n't , huh ? Are you calling us liars , Jack ?

MASTERS HIMSELF: Do you want a ballplayer who does n't have the guts to fight ack ? Is that what you want ?
RICKEY: I want one who has the guts not to fight back ! There are people who will not like this . They will do anything to get you to react . If you echo a curse with a curse , they will only hear yours . Follow a low with a blow and they will say a Negro lost his temper ; that the Negro does not belong . Your enemy will be out in force , but you can not meet him on his own low ground . We win with hitting , running and fielding , nothing else . We win if the world is convinced of two things that you are a fine gentlemen and a great ballplayer . Like our Savior , you must have the guts to turn the other cheek . Jack considers Rickey . Rickey looks worn out .
JACK: Mr. Rickey , you give me a uniform , you give me a number on my back , and I 'll give you the guts .

RICKEY: Wagner is number two . And Rabbit Tavener would not break my top 25 . Where do you suppose Jackie Robinson will end up on that list ?
SMITH: He wo n't break it . He does n't have a shortstop 's arm . Robinson elongs on second base .
RICKEY: Alright then , where would he rate at second ?
SMITH: If he was playing now he 'd be the est second baseman in the majors .
RICKEY: High praise . He 'll have to be the est in the minor leagues first .
SMITH: What are you saying , Mr. Rickey ?
RICKEY: I 'm saying it 's going to be a very interesting spring training . A lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over , we can train down in Florida again .
SMITH: Daytona Beach ?
RICKEY NODS: You 're aware in the past six months a black boy was lynched in Madison , Florida and a black man down in Live Oaks ?
RICKEY: Those towns may as well be a million miles from Daytona .
SMITH: Live Oaks is 150 actually .
RICKEY: I spoke to the Daytona mayor . He assures me there 'll be no trouble .
SMITH: I 'm a Democrat . Why do you ask ?
RICKEY: I have a business proposition . What 's your salary at the Courier ?
SMITH: Fifty dollars a week .
RICKEY: I will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with Jackie Robinson . You will watch over him , help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn . You will act as his chauffeur , you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be , help him find restaurants , etc
SMITH: What 's in it for me ? Besides the fifty dollars and a whole lot of aggravation ?
RICKEY: Unprecedented access for any eportage you feel appropriate . What do you say , Mr. Smith ?
SMITH: I say yes , sir . If a Negro is good enough to stop a Nazi bullet in France ; he 's good enough to stop a line drive at Yankee Stadium .
RICKEY: Ebbets Field actually , but yes , I agree . The world is ready .
SPEAKER: As our former President Herbert Hoover remarked in his tribute to our national pastime â€˜The rigid voluntary rules of right and wrong , as applied in baseball , are second only to religion in strengthening the morals of the American people . '

COLONEL: Rickey that no good carpetbagger ! What could he be thinking !
BUTLER: Ah came near bein ' killed last night , Kunl .
COLONEL: How 's that , Jackie boy ?
BUTLER: Ah was comin ' up a dark street and three men was behind me . And they tried to do me with a baseball bat .
COLONEL: You do n't say ?
BUTLER: Yes , suh . Ah recognized one of dem . Ah 'm gon na hab him arrested .
COLONEL: But I thought you said it was dark ?
BUTLER: It was . But I know he played fo the Philadelphia Baseball Club . On account of he struck at me three times and never hit me once .
MALLIE: You knock the cover off that ball .
JACK: I will , Mama . Mallie hugs Jack and then kisses Rachel .
MALLIE: Look after each other .
RACHEL: We will .
MALLIE: Take this . It 's chicken .
JACK: They have food on the plane , Mama .
MALLIE: You never know what might happen . I do n't want you getting there starving and too weak to hit .
JACK: I could n't tell her no .
RACHEL: I know she means well ; I just do n't want to be seen eating chicken out of a box like some country bumpkin . Jack runs his hand over her coat .
JACK: No one 's going to mistake you for a umpkin in this .
RACHEL: Well , they 'll know I belong on that plane or wherever I happen to be .
JACK: The flight to Pensacola leaves in an hour You okay ?
RACHEL: I 've just never seen one before .
JACK: We 're not in Pasadena anymore . A sudden momentum carries her forward .
RACHEL: Did you promise him we would n't go to the bathroom ? You 've done it .
JACK: Before I promised .
RACHEL: It was just a toilet . You 'd think the commodes were made of gold .
COOK: You folks ca n't sit here .
JACK: Excuse me ?
COOK: It 's white only .
JACK: No . You hang onto those .
MISS BISHOP: Jack Robinson ? Come with me .
LOW: Tell her you 're with the Dodgers . Jack would rather not play that card .
JACK: When 's the next flight ?
MISS BISHOP: Tomorrow morning . But it 's booked . So someone 'll have to cancel .
JACK: Look , I 'm with the Brooklyn Dodge organization . I 've got to get down to Daytona . I 'm supposed to report to spring training in the morning .
MISS BISHOP: We 'll do our best to get you down there by tomorrow afternoon , but it might be the day after .
MISS BISHOP: Do you want to call the Sheriff ? Or should I ?
JACK: Mama knew
RACHEL: It 's good .
REESE STANKY: I got it ! I got it ! I got it ! I got it !
DUROCHER: That 's what spring training 's for , oys ! Sort out our differences !
LAUGHING: I 'm old !
DUROCHER: I 'm gon na squeeze one more year out of that worn out body of yours !
WALKER: If you could , skipper , my wife would sure appreciate it !
DUROCHER: Keeping the women happy ! That 's what it 's all about !
RICKEY: How are they looking , Leo ?
DUROCHER: Rusty , Mr. Rickey . But we 'll get â€˜em oiled up and ready in no time . You find your lost sheep yet ?
PARROTT: Jackie Robinson 's on a bus leaving Pensacola .
RICKEY: A bus ? Harold , how in blazes did he end up on a bus ? !
HIGBE: Why do n't they just put him on a watermelon truck ?
BRANCA: What 's the matter with you guys ?
BRAGAN: Not a thing , Branca , but we ai n't just two pretty faces either .
SMITH: Jackie Robinson Mr. Rickey sent me to meet you . Wendell Smith . Pittsburgh Courier . I 'm going to e your Boswell .
JACK: My who ?
SMITH: Your chronicler , your advance man . Hell , even your chauffeur . Mrs. Robinson .
RACHEL: It 's Rachel .
SMITH: Man , you two look wiped out .
SHARP: You got a car ? Get us out of here .
SMITH: You ever been down South before , Rachel ?
RACHEL: First time . We have our problems in Pasadena , but not like this .
SMITH: Mr. Rickey says we follow the law . If Jim Crow and the state of Florida say Negroes do this and that , then we do this and that .
SOFTLY: My life 's changing right in front of me . Who I am , who I think I am .
SMITH: Joe and Duff Harris live here . He gets out the black vote , does a lot of good for colored folks .
IMITATES RICKEY: If we ca n't put the Robinsons in the hotels , they should stay some- place that represents something .
SMITH: Brooklyn plays downtown ; Montreal a few blocks from here . You 'll stay with the Harrises except for a few days at the end of the week . The whole Dodger organization is going to Sanford , about 45 minute away . You 'll stay here though , Rachel .
RACHEL: Where are the other wives staying ?
SMITH: There are no other wives . You 're the only one Mr. Rickey allowed to spring training .
MRS. HARRIS: I call this the love nest . I hope you like it .
RACHEL: I 'm sure . Thank you . As Jack enters , Mrs. Harris starts back down .
MRS. HARRIS: Dinner 's at five . Rachel enters , closes the door behind her
JACK: It 's a joke , right ?
RACHEL: I like it . The love nest .
JACK: I 'll try to remember As the kisses become more urgent
SMITH: The first day of Spring Training . My Pittsburgh Courier readers need to know how it feels .
JACK: It 's okay .
SMITH: That 's not exactly a headline .
BRUSQUE: That 's all I got .
SMITH: Look , Jack , right now it 's just me asking you . But you get on that field and it 's going to be the New York Times and the Sporting News . You should think about it .
JACK: If they ask something , I 'll answer .
SMITH: Alright , but you know when you 're at the plate , you want to feel like you see the pitch come in slow ? Well , you want to see the questions come in slow , too .
RICKEY: Listen to this , Harold . Whenever I hear a white man - yours truly - oadcasting what a Moses he is to the Negro race , then I know the latter needs a bodyguard . ( Parrott tries to
FINALLY: He 's here , Mr. Rickey .
RICKEY: Why did n't you say so ? !
REESE: That 's him , huh ?
STANKY: Take a wild guess .
REPORTER ONE: Jackie , do you think you can make it with these white boys ?
JACK: Sure , I had no problem with white men in the service or at UCLA .
REPORTER TWO: What 'll you do if one of these pitchers throws at your head ?
JACK: I 'll duck . That gets some laughs .
REPORTER THREE: Jack , what 's your natural position ?
ROBINSON: I 've been playing shortstop .
REPORTER THREE: Are you after Pee Wee Reese 's job ?
JACK: Reese plays for Brooklyn . I 'm worried about making Montreal .
REPORTER ONE: Is this about politics ?
JACK: It 's about getting paid . Jack doing beautifully . Smith breathes a sigh of relief
MISSISSIPPI TWANG: Well , when Mr. Rickey picks one , he sure picks a black one .
WALKER: He 's fine with me , so long as you keep him up in Montreal .
HOPPER: Here comes the old man to save him .
WALKER: Good luck , Hop
RICKEY: Clay , I 'd like you to meet Jackie Robinson . Jackie , Clay Hopper , manager of the Montreal Royals .
HOPPER: We ai n't doing much today . Just throwing the ball around and hitting a few . Why do n't you toss a few with those fellas over there ?
CALLS OVER: Hey , Jorgensen !
HOPPER: Meet Jackie Robinson .
HIGBE: Hey , Rook ! Did you hear about the edneck shortstop ?
BRAGAN: He thought the last two words of the National Anthem were Play Ball !
HIGBE: How about the shortstop making all the errors , tried to kill himself y jumping out on the highway ?
BRAGAN: A bus just missed him . Drove right etween his legs !
SMITH: Between his legs , good one . He must 've read a joke book . If he can read .
MR. BROCK: Jackie , I 'm Ray Brock . Welcome to Sanford Florida ! The day belongs to decent minded people .
TO JACK: My wife 's inside cooking . You know what she asked me this morning ? She asked me , what do you serve when a hero 's coming for dinner ?
JACK: I 'm just a ballplayer , Mr. Brock .
MR. BROCK: Tell that to all the little colored oys playing baseball in Florida today . You 're a hero to them .
JACK: No thank you , sir , I do n't drink .
MR. BROCK: A ballplayer who does n't drink ? That 's a new one on me .
SMITH: I 'll have one . I 'm a stereotypical eporter through and through .
JACK: Mr. Brock , do you have a desk ? I 'd like to get a letter to my wife .
MR. BROCK: Of course , this way .
HOPPER: He 's getting by on a quick release , ut his arm 's too weak for short . Second base is his spot .
RICKEY: I agree . And I 'll state anothe obvious , Clay , I need the players to act like gentlemen around him .
HOPPER: Uh huh .
RICKEY: To treat him as they would any other teammate .
HOPPER: Uh huh .
RICKEY: To be natural , to impose no estrictions on themselves . To all work together in harmony .
CHUCKLING: Superhuman ? Do n't get carried away , Mr. Rickey , that 's still a Nigger out there .
RICKEY: Clay , I realize that attitude is part of your heritage ; that you practically nursed race prejudice at your mother 's breast , so I will let it pass . But I will add this you can manage Robinson fairly and correctly or you can be unemployed .
HOPPER: Attaboy , Jackie ! Way to turn two !
MR. BROCK: I hope Jackie sleeps alright . Chasing baseballs in the sun all day , I 'd be in my grave . How are they treating him out there ?
SMITH: Okay as far as I can see .
FROWNS: You find good people every place you go . Even here in Florida
STOPPING BELOW: Is he in there ?
SMITH: Who is it you 're looking for ?
LUTHER: Nigra ball player . The air suddenly alive with danger .
SMITH: He 's asleep . Maybe you better come ack in the morning .
LUTHER: I ai n't comin ' back . Other fellas is comin ' . They ai n't too happy about him stayin ' here in Sanford . Playin ' ball with white boys . Skedaddle , that 's what I 'd do . If ' n they get here , and he 's still here , there 's gon na be trouble .
RICKEY'S VOICE: Yes , Wendell , what is it ?
RICKEY: I see Yes , I understand . Wake him up and get him out of there . Put him in the car and start driving for Daytona Beach . Now . And , Wendell , under no circumstance tell him what this is about . I do not want him to get it in his head to stay there and fight .
JACK: I was just getting loose . Smith sticks his head in the door .
SMITH: Do n't just sit there . Pack you duds . We 're blowin ' .
SMITH'S VOICE: Yes , Mr. Rickey , I 'm with him now We 're pulling out fo Daytona in five minutes , soon as he gets his bag packed Yes , yes , it 's just one of those things .
JACK: I wonder what he wants ?
SMITH: To run us out of town .
JACK: What are you talking about ?
SMITH: Man came by while you were asleep .
CHECKS MIRROR: Told us more men were coming . Maybe those boys . Mr. Rickey said to get you to Daytona Beach a-s-a-p .
JACK: Why did n't you say so ?
SMITH: Mr. Rickey was afraid you would n't leave , that you would fight . As it becomes clear , Jack starts to LAUGH .
JACK: I thought you woke me because I was cut from the team .
MOTHER: Ed ! You stay where I can see you !
ED: I 'm thirteen years old .
RICKEY: I 've spoken to the mayor . I 've explained how much money we 'll spend in Daytona . But still , when this fine young Negro man steps on that field today , he and the Dodgers will technically be eaking the law . A law which says white and black players can not enjoy the same field at the same time . Does that make sense to you ? Does Jim Crow make any sense when placed against the words of the United States Constitution ? When placed against the word of God ?
PA ANNOUNCER: Now batting the second baseman Jackie Robinson !
RACHEL: Jack 's got a thick skin . He 'll be okay .
SMITH: How about you ?
SHRUGS: I better get one in a hurry .
SPECTATOR ONE: Come on , black boy , you can make the grade !
SPECTATOR TWO: They 're giving you a chance ! Do something about it !
ED: Please , God , let Jackie show them what we can do .
UMPIRE: Ball two !
HIGBE: Come on , Rook ! Ai n't you gon na swing at something ? !
SMITH: It 's just a walk .
RACHEL: Who can blame them ?
FROM DUGOUT: Well throw over there for crying out loud !
RICKEY: Watching from a seat behind third .
HIGBE: Hell ! You 're supposed to go back to third when I step off ! Do n't you know nothing ? !
MOTHER: I do n't understand . What happened ?
ED: It 's a balk , Mama . The pitche ca n't start toward home and then stop . Jackie scores .
MOTHER: But he did n't do anything .
ED: Oh , mama , yes he did , he discombobulated the man .
DUGOUT: Durocher looks to Branca , impressed .
DUROCHER: He did n't come to play ; he came to kill .
WALKER: This really how it 's gon na be some day ? Baseball ?
POLICEMAN: Git offa this field now !
JACK: What ! ? Why ?
POLICEMAN: It 's against the law is why . No niggers do n't play with no white oys . Git off or go to jail .
JACK: You swing that thing you better hit me between the eyes with it .
POLICEMAN: Is that so ?
HOPPER: Hey , hold on , what 'd he do wrong ?
POLICEMAN: We ai n't havin ' Nigras mix with white boys in this town . Ya 'll ai n't up-states now ; they got ta stay separate . Brooklyn Dodgers ai n't changing our way of living . Where are you all from anyhow ?
HOPPER: Greenwood , Mississippi .
POLICEMAN: Hell , man , you oughta know better . Now tell your Nigra I said to git . You think I 'm foolin ' ?
RACHEL'S VOICE: What did you do ?
JACK: I said okay , Skipper , tell him Ah 'm a-gittin ' . Sho'nuff , ah is .
RACHEL: You did n't ?
JACK: I did . Then I took a long shower . We lost 2 to 1 .
RACHEL: Ah 'm a-gittin ' , ah 'm a gittin ' .
JACK: You 're not getting away from me .
LOOKING PAST: Jack
JACK: Get back , Rae . Go back .
CRACKER: I want you to know something .
JACK: Yeah , what 's that ?
CRACKER: I want you to know I 'm pulling fo you to make good . And a lot of folks here feel the same way . If a man 's got the goods , he deserves a fair chance . That 's all . Ma'am .
JACK: You wanted to see me , Mr. Rickey ? Rickey nods , consider the field a moment .
RICKEY: Bermuda grass grows so well here . I wish we could get it to grow like this in Brooklyn .
JACK: I like the way it smells when they mow it .
RICKEY: Me , too .
JACK: I wo n't let you down .
RICKEY: I know that .
JACK: If you do n't mind , I 've got to go tell my wife .
RICKEY: Give her my regards . Jack about to head off when he looks back..
JACK: Why are you doing this , Mr. Rickey ?
RICKEY: I 'm an opportunist . With you and the Negro players I hope to bring up next year I 'll put together a team that can win the World Series . And the World Series means money . Jack studies him a beat , not quite buying it .
JACK: I do n't think what I believe is important . Only what I do .
RICKEY: Agreed . Therefore , run the bases like the Devil himself .
CROWD VOICE: Come on , Jackie , this fella ca n't pitch !
SMITH: You okay ?
RACHEL: I think I might be sick .
STANDING: Excuse me , Wendell .
SMITH: I 'd be sick at a swing like that , too .
OLDER WOMAN: Are you alright , honey ?
RACHEL: I 'm sick . I do n't know why .
OLDER WOMAN: When did you have your monthly last ?
RACHEL: I 'm late .
OLDER WOMAN: It may be that you 're pregnant .
ECHOING: Now batting . Jackie Robinson .
SMITH: Come on , Jackie . Come on , batter .
HOPPER: I 'll be damned
RACHEL: Oh , Jack Oh Jack
DOCTOR: It 's a boy . As Rachel holds out her arms for him
JACK: My daddy left . He left us flat in Cairo , Georgia . I was only six months older than you are now . I do n't remember him . Nothing good , nothing bad . Nothing .
A BEAT: But you 're going to remember me . And I am going to be with you until the day I die . The stakes just got raised
MILLER: As all of us know a young Negro second baseman played north of the order last season INSERT Brooklyn YMCA . February 5 , 1947 .
DEACON ONE: Look here what he did .
READS: Led the International League in atting .349 , in stolen bases 40 , uns scored 113 . Plus batted .400 in the Minor League World Series .
DEACON TWO: Last season does n't matter . The International League , it does n't matter . What matters is this year . What matters is Brooklyn .
DEACON ONE: Shhh Here he comes . As Herbert Miller introduces
MILLER: I present the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodger baseball club , Mr . Branch Rickey !
RICKEY: Good evening . I have something very important to talk with you about tonight . Something that will equire courage from all of us .
RICKEY: He may stay there or he may be ought to Brooklyn . But if Jackie does come up to the Dodgers , the iggest threat to his success , the one enemy most likely to ruin that success , is the Negro people themselves !
MILLER: I question your bedside manner , Mr. Rickey , but they 've agreed to set up a committee of self-policing . We 'll call it the 'Do n't Spoil Jackie 's Chances ' campaign .
RICKEY: Thank you , Mr. Miller . I 'm sorry ; the spotlight will be on us all .
DUROCHER: Yeah ?
RICKEY'S VOICE: Hello , Leo , what are you doing ?
DUROCHER: I 'm bowling . Wait , I 'm snowshoeing in the Alps . I 'm trying to sleep , Mr. Rickey . It 's still dark out .
RICKEY: Another spring training is upon us . In Panama . I need to know you attitude toward Jackie Robinson .
DUROCHER: I do n't got an attitude toward him .
RICKEY: Eight times in the Bible we 're told to love our neighbor . It 's one of God 's most repeated commands .
SOFTLY: Hi
DUROCHER: I do n't know much about the Bible .
LORRAINE: Me neither
DUROCHER: But I did n't go to school just to eat my lunch either . I 'll play an elephant if he can help us win . To make room for him , I 'll send my own other home if he 's not as good .
LORRAINE: What are you going to do with me ?
DUROCHER: We 're playing for money , Mr. Rickey . Winning 's the only thing that matters . Is he a nice guy ?
RICKEY: If by nice you mean soft , no , not particularly .
DUROCHER: Good . He ca n't afford to be . Nice guys finish last .
LORRAINE: What about nice girls ?
RICKEY: So you have no objections to him ?
DUROCHER: None whatsoever . Can I go back to sleep now ?
RICKEY: Yes . Oh and Leo ?
DUROCHER: What ?
RICKEY: The Bible says a thing or two about adultery as well .
DUROCHER: I 'm sure it 's got a lot to say about a lot . Good night . Durocher hangs up the phone , looks to her .
LORRAINE: Leo , I thought you knew As she kisses him
RACHEL: Promise me you 'll write .
JACK: When did I ever not write ?
RACHEL: I want you to know I 'm there fo you . Even if it 's words on paper .
JACK: Rae , you 're in my heart . She sighs , rests her head on his shoulder .
RACHEL: You 're getting close now . The closer you get , the worse they 'll e. Do n't let them get to you .
JACK: I will not . God built me to last . He kisses her . She kisses him back .
RACHEL: See you in Brooklyn in eight weeks .
JACK: It might be Montreal .
RACHEL: It 's going to be Brooklyn . I know it is .
JACK: I 've got to go , Rae .
DUROCHER: It 's a pipe dream , Mr. Rickey .
RICKEY: Pipe dream ? What do you mean by pipe dream ? INSERT Panama City , Panama . March 18 , 1947 .
DUROCHER: I mean it ai n't gon na happen . The Dodgers are never gon na demand Robinson be brought up from Montreal . Ball players are conservative .
RICKEY: A team full of tough war veterans ? Immigrants ' sons ? Boys from impoverished parts of the country ?
DUROCHER: It - ai n't - gon na - happen .
RICKEY: You really believe they wo n't accept him ? Once they see how he plays , how he can help them win .
DUROCHER: I 'm not saying they wo n't accept him I 'm saying they wo n't ask fo him . I 'm saying Robinson 's good medicine , but they 're not gon na like the taste . I 'm saying bend over , boys , and get ready , this one might hurt a little .
ANOTHER FORKFUL: Boy , this is good fish .
BRAGAN: Why do you think Rickey 's got us playing spring games in Panama ?
HIGBE: We , the undersigned Brooklyn Dodgers will not play ball on the same field as Jackie Robinson .
CASEY: If you wan na make your mark , Dixie , we can witness it .
STANKY'S VOICE: C'mon in !
STANKY: What 's goin ' on ?
HIGBE: Got a petition goin ' on , Stank .
BRAGAN: To keep Robinson up in Montreal where he belongs .
STANKY: Oh Did Pee Wee sign it ?
HIGBE: Ai n't asked him yet . What difference does it make ?
STANKY: None , just wonderin ' .
REESE: Look , it 's like this . I got a wife , a baby , and I got no money . I do n't want to step in anything .
TO WALKER: Skip me , Dix , I 'm not interested .
WALKER: What if they put him at shortstop ?
SHRUGS: If he 's man enough to take my job , I suppose he deserves it .
HIGBE: The hell he does !
WALKER: He does not have the ice water in his veins for big league baseball .
REESE: So let him show what he 's got . Robinson can play or he ca n't . It 'll all take care of itself .
FURILLO: Give me the pen .
DUROCHER: Yes , Mr. Rickey .
RICKEY'S VOICE: Have our friends in the press gone to sleep yet ?
DUROCHER: We are the only people awake on this entire isthmus , Mr. Rickey .
RICKEY'S VOICE: A deliberate violation of the law , needs a little show of force . I leave it to you . Good night , Leo .
DUROCHER: Yes , Mr. Rickey .
WALKER: C'mon , Leo
DUROCHER: Come on what ? !
WALKER: Ball players got ta live together , shower together , it 's not right to force him on us . Besides , I own a hardware store back home and I
DUROCHER: Screw your hardware store , Dix ! And if you do n't like it , screw you ! Mr. Rickey 'll be happy to make other arrangements for you .
SUKEFORTH: Robinson !
JACK: What do you want me to do with this ?
SUKEFORTH: Play first base .
JACK: I 've never played first base in my life , Coach .
SUKEFORTH: Well , it 's like this . Brooklyn 's got a solid second baseman . And they got Pee Wee Reese at short . But first base is up for grabs . Are you catching my drift ?
NODS: Yeah . I do n't need a glove to do that .
PANAMANIAN KID: El es muy malo .
SUKEFORTH: Mr. Rickey said he wants you playing conspicuous baseball !
WHACK: To be so good the Dodgers 'll demand you on the team !
SUKEFORTH: Conspicuous .
RICKEY: Bragan , most of your teammates have ecanted on this petition nonsense . Are you really here to tell me you do n't want to play with Robinson ?
BRAGAN: Yes , Sir . My friends back in Birmingham would never forgive me .
RICKEY: And your friends here in Brooklyn ? Then I will accommodate you . If you give me your word that you will try your very best for this team until I can work out a trade .
BRAGAN: Do you think I would quit on anyone ? ! I do n't quit .
RICKEY: Only on yourself apparently . You can go , Bragan .
RICKEY'S VOICE: Send Dixie in .
RICKEY: I received your letter , Dixie .
READS: Recently , the thought has occurred to me that a change of ball clubs would benefit both the Brooklyn Baseball Club and myself .
TO WALKER: This is about Robinson ?
WALKER: I 'm keeping my reasons private . Hope you can respect that , sir .
RICKEY: I realize , Dixie , that you have a Southern upbringing , that you would have to subordinate your feelings for the welfare of this venture . I for one would deeply appreciate it . I think we can all learn something .
WALKER: What I have , Mr. Rickey , is a hardware store back home . It 's called Dixie Walker 's . Folks do n't come because I have the lowest prices , they come because it 's called Dixie Walker 's . Understand ? And I make as much money owning that store as I do playing for you .
RICKEY: Is that what you 're you afraid of ? Bragan 's a third-stringer , but you at clean-up . You 're popular in Brooklyn . Children look up to you !
WALKER: You got my letter ; can I go ?
RICKEY: I 'll start looking for a trade or a sale . But it wo n't happen until I get value in return . Until then I expect you to drive in runs .
WALKER: I always have . That 's my job .
JACK: You again . Smith leans back , blinks .
SMITH: That 's right . Me again . Something wrong with that , Jack ?
JACK: Come on . Jack continues past . As Smith follows
SMITH: They ca n't keep you on Montreal fo long . After these exhibition games , they 've got to bring you up .
NO REPLY: You do n't have two words to ru together , do you ?
JACK: Do I have to entertain you ? More silence , then
SMITH: You ever wonder why I sit out in ight field with my typewriter on my knees ? Does that ever cross your mind ?
JACK: If I start talking , will you stop ?
SMITH: I 'd be happy to . Smith stops at a red light .
JACK: I apologize . You 've been there fo me through this more than anyone esides Rae and Mr. Rickey . But I guess that 's what bothers me .
SMITH: How do you mean ?
JACK: I do n't like needing someone to be there for me . I do n't like needing anyone but myself . I never have .
SMITH: You are a hard case , Jack Robinson . Is it okay if I keep driving you o should I let you out so you can walk ? Jack bursts out laughing . So does Smith .
JACK: You remember the last time we were at a red light ? Down in Florida ?
SMITH: New York City now , baby . We 've come a long way .
JACK: And we got a long way to go . The light turns green . Off they go .
RICKEY: Branch Rickey can not afford to upset team chemistry and so the only thing keeping Robinson off the Dodgers now , plainly , is the attitude of the players . INSERT Brooklyn . April 9 , 1947 .

HAPPY: It 's not just one thing , it 's an accumulation . I received notice today from the Catholic Youth Organization . Vowing a ban on aseball unless Durocher is punished for his moral looseness .
RICKEY: You 're joking .
HAPPY: It 's this business with the actress in California . She 's recently divorced and Durocher is the cause . They may even be illegally married .
RICKEY: Now I 'm sure you 're joking .
HAPPY: I wish I were . The CYO buy a lot of tickets , Branch . They draw a lot of water and I ca n't afford to uffle their feathers . Am I mixing metaphors there ?
RICKEY: You know very well my organization is about to enter a tempest . I need Durocher at the rudder . He 's the only man who can handle this much trouble , who loves it in fact . You 're chopping off my right hand !
HAPPY: I have no choice . I 'm going to have to sit your manager , Branch . Leo Durocher is suspended from aseball for a year .
RICKEY: You ca n't do that ! Happy , you son of a bitch !
JACK: Hello ?
RICKEY: I 'm so sorry about the rush . Events are unfolding too fast to keep up with . The burden has finally fallen to me and so be it .
RICKEY: Yes , yes .
RACHEL: Hello ?
JACK'S VOICE: Rae , I 'm in Brooklyn .
RACHEL: What did I tell you ?
REESE: Opening day nerves . Doing my stomach something awful .
SMILES: Every time I see a garbage truck go y I still ca n't figure why the guy driving is n't me .
SMILES BACK: We 'd both better get on base .
REESE: Know when I first heard of you ?
JACK: No I do n't .
REESE: On a troop transport , coming back from Guam . A sailor heard it on the radio , told me the Dodgers had signed a Negro player . I said that was fine by me . Then he said the guy was a shortstop . Least you were then . That got me thinking . Thinking gets me scared . Jack smiles , hefts his bottle of Pepto .
JACK: Black , white , we 're both pink today , huh ?
REESE NODS: You still scared , Pee Wee ?
REESE: Of garbage trucks ? Terrified .
HERMANSKI: I 'm Hermanski . Welcome to Brooklyn .
BRANCA: Hey , man . Ralph Branca .
JORGENSEN: We made it , Jack , huh ? Good luck .
BABE: You 're looking for your locker , huh , kid ? Follow me .
STANKY: You 're putting on that uniform , it means you 're on my team . But before I play with you I want you to know how I feel about it . I want you to know I do n't like it . I want you to know I do n't like you .
JACK: That 's fine . That 's how I prefe it . Right out in the open .
VENDOR: C'mon , Brooklyn ! Get your Harry M. Stevens special here !
RACHEL: Okay , okay , that 's good . As Jackie 's eyes find hers
EVERETT MCCOOEY: O'er the land of the free ! And the home of the brave !
BRAGAN: You 're crazy standing that close to him .
BRANCA: What do you mean ?
LAUGHING: What if the sharpshooter misses and hits you instead ?
BRANCA: You got a serious problem , Bragan , you know that ?
BRAGAN: Really ? I do n't see it .
RICKEY: Opening day , Harold . The world is all future and no past .
PARROT: A blank page , sir .
BARBER: One out in the bottom of the first . Headed toward the plate for his first big league at bat is Dodge ookie Jackie Robinson . Jackie is very definitely brunette .
FAN: We 're with you , Jackie !
FAN #2: Hey , boy , how about a shine ? !
BARBER'S VOICE: Sain looking in . When he 's got that fastball working , he can toss a lamb chop past a hungry wolf .
UMPIRE: You 're out !
RICKEY: It 's a game of inches , Jackie !
PARROTT: Get some glasses , ump !
SHOTTON: Roses need pruning , but fine when I left it last night . Branch said it was important and I heard about Leo . Any idea what this is about ?
PARROTT: You 'd better just talk to him .
RICKEY'S VOICE: Come in !
RICKEY: Baseball has returned to Brooklyn , Burt . Another season is underway .
SHOTTON: Yeah , it 's a shame about Leo .
RICKEY: Inevitable I suppose . I asked him if she was worth it and he said yes . How 's the retirement ?
SHOTTON: It 's fine . The roses
RICKEY: It 's a helluva thing when a man has good health and enough money and absolutely nothing to do .
SHOTTON: I 'm perfectly happy .
RICKEY: Is that so ?
SHOTTON: When I took off that Cleveland uniform two years ago , I promised the Mrs . I 'd never put on anothe uniform again . Roses look great and I sleep a whole lot better .
RICKEY: Roses and sleep are two wonderful things , Burt . But sleep you can get inside your casket and flowers look good on top of it . You do n't look like a dead man to me .
SHOTTON: What 's this about , Branch ?
RICKEY: I need you to manage the Dodgers . We 're a ship without a captain ; there 's a typhoon ahead .
SHOTTON: No , I 'm sorry , but no .
RICKEY: Do you miss the game , Burt ? Look me in the eye and tell me you do n't .
SHOTTON: Baseball 's the only life for an old pepper pot like me , but I promised my wife , Branch .
RICKEY: You promised her you would n't put on another uniform . You did n't promise her you would n't manage . Wear a suit and tie ; Connie Mack still does .
A BEAT: You remember how to get to the Polo Grounds , Burt ?
SHOTTON: Branch , I
RICKEY: You remember what the peanuts smell like roasting , how the crack of the at sounds , the roar of the crowd ?
SHOTTON: Sure Rickey tosses him a set of car keys .
RICKEY: My car 's parked right out front . Harold will show you where . Now what do you say ?
SHOTTEN: Okay .
SHOTTON: Men , I do n't have much to say . Just , do n't be afraid of old Burt Shotton as a manager . You can win the pennant in spite of me . I can not possibly hurt you .
JACK NODS: I thought so .
COOKE: Mark my words and circle this date . Negroes are going to run the white man straight out of baseball . I 'm not prejudiced ; it 's physiological . They have a longer heel bone . Gives em an unfair speed advantage .
BARBER'S VOICE: Here 's Robinson . Jackie holds that club down by the end . Rear foot on the back line of the box . Slight open stance , bent at the knees
ANOTHER REPORTER: Was that because his heels are longer , Bob ? ! As everyone cracks up , everyone but Bob
JACK: I 'm not complaining , I just , I do n't know what they want .
BEAMING: They want to see if Jackie Robinson is real . They want to see you pride , your dignity . Because then they 'll see it in themselves .
OWNER: I 'm Lawson Bowman , Jack , the owne of this joint . How 's the steak ?
JACK: I 'm not sure yet . It looks good .
RACHEL: You 're lucky you 're a boy .
ALICE: Sorry I 'm late . Class ran long .
RACHEL: It 's okay . Rachel gently hands the baby over .
ALICE: He 'll be nice and warm here .
RACHEL: I 'm going to be late .
CHAPMAN'S VOICE: Hey ! Hey you black Nigger !
CHAPMAN: Why do n't you go back to the cotton fields where you belong !
BARBER: Chapman the Phillies manager up on the top step , seems to be chirping something out to Robinson . Chapman a hothead during his playing days with the Yankees .
RICKEY: What 's he saying ?
CHAPMAN: Bojangles ! You sure can dance , snowflake !
UMPIRE: Ball two !
CHAPMAN'S VOICE: Hey , black boy ! Hey , shoe shine !
CHAPMAN: You like white girls ? ! Huh ? ! Which one of them Dodger boys ' wives are you climbing on tonight ? ! Chapman looks toward
DODGER DUGOUT: They do n't like that one .
RACHEL: Look at me , baby . Look at me .
CHAPMAN: Hey , Pee Wee ! Dixie ! What 's this Nigger doing for you all to let him drink from the same water fountain as you ? ! I hope it 's worth it !
DUTCH: Hey , is that a home run ! ?
SEMINICK: Yeah ! If you 're playing in an elevator shaft !
CHAPMAN: You do n't belong ! Look in a mirror ! This is a white man 's game . Get it through your thick monkey skull !
RACHEL: Sick for her husband .
JACK: To hell with this . The next white son of a bitch who opens his mouth , I 'll smash his goddamn teeth in .
RICKEY: You ca n't , Jackie . You know it .
JACK: I 'm supposed to let this go on ?
RICKEY: These men have to live with
JACK: I have to live with myself , too ! And right now I 'm living a sermon out there . I 'm through with it !
RICKEY: You do n't matter right now , Jack . You 're in this thing . You do n't have the right to pull out from the acking of people who believe in you , respect you and who need you .
JACK: Is that so ?
RICKEY: If you fight , they wo n't say Chapman forced you to ; they 'll just say that you 're over your head . That you belong where you are .
JACK: Do you know what it 's like , having someone do this to you ? !
RICKEY: No . You do . You 're the one living the sermon . In the wilderness . Forty days . All of it . Only you .
JACK: And not a damn thing I can do about it .
RICKEY: Of course there is ! You can stand up and hit ! You can get on base and you can score ! You can win this game for us ! We need you as well ! Everyone needs you . You 're medicine , Jack .
JACK: They 're taking the field .
RICKEY: Who 's playing first ?
JACK: I 'm gon na need a new bat .
CHAPMAN: Hey , black Nigger ! I know you can hear me ! If you were a white boy , you know where you 'd be right now ? ! On a bus headed down to Newport News cuz you ca n't play for shit !
BARBER: Two strikes now to Reiser as Leonard looks in . Robinson with another big lead off first . He 's as estless as a cat with a hot foot .
RACHEL: Steal it , sweetheart . Take it .
HANDLEY: I 'm sorry . I want you to know what goes on here , it do n't go for me . Jack barely nods , but he heard .
BARBER'S VOICE: Hermanski steps up .
CHAPMAN: You fellas are making too big a deal out of this . He scored We lost . One to nothing .
REPORTER THREE: Do you think you were a little hard on Robinson ?
CHAPMAN: We treat him the same way we do Hank Greenburg except we call Hank a kike instead of a coon . When we play exhibitions against the Yankees , we call DiMaggio the Wop . They laugh at it . No harm , it 's forgotten after the game ends . Chapman tosses away his beer can .
REPORTER THREE: Do n't you think this was maybe one foot over the line ?
CHAPMAN: Hey . Let 's get the chips off ou shoulders and play ball . It 's a game , right ?
PARROTT: I 'm going in that Phillie dugout tomorrow and wring Chapman 's neck !
RICKEY: When I first told you about Jackie , you were against it . Now all of a sudden you 're worrying about him . How do you suppose that happened ?
PARROTT: Well , any decent minded person
RICKEY: Sympathy , Harold , is a Greek word . It means to suffer . I sympathize with you means I suffer with you . This Philadelphia manager has done me a service .
PARROTT: A service ? !
RICKEY: Is there an echo in here ? Yes , he 's creating sympathy on Jackie 's ehalf . Philadelphia by the way is Greek for brotherly love . The intercom BUZZES .
FLASHES ANGRY: What in Satan 's fire does he want ?
PRESSES BUTTON: Send him in .
RICKEY: What do you want , Bragan ?
BRAGAN: I 'd like not to be traded , sir , if it is n't too late .
RICKEY: What about Robinson ?
BRAGAN: I 'd like to be his teammate .
RICKEY: Why ?
BRAGAN: The world 's changing ; I guess I can live with the change .
SARCASTIC: Red Sox just offered Ted Williams , ut I 'll see what I can do .
BRAGAN: Thank you , Mr. Rickey .
JACK: You should n't have waited .
RACHEL: They have n't made a day long enough that I would n't wait for you .
JACK: Give these boys time . It 's a three game series .
RACHEL: They are never going to beat you .
JACK: They 're taking their best shot . I do n't want you coming tomorrow . I do n't want you to watch that , them eating me .
RACHEL: Wherever you are , I am , too . Look at me . Jack
JACK: I did good the day I met you .
RACHEL: Baby , you hit a home run .
CHAPMAN: Hey , porch monkey ! Hey Robinson ! Hey boy ! You know why you 're here ?
CHAPMAN: You 're here to draw those Nigge dollars at the gate for Rickey !
STANKY: Sit down . Sit down or I 'll sit you down .
CHAPMAN: What 's the problem , Stank ?
STANKY: You 're the problem , you goddamn disgrace ! What kind of man are you ? ! You know he ca n't fight ! Pick on someone who can fight !
OVER IT: Eddie Stanky having a chin wag with his ex-teammate Chapman . Both men masters of distraction . Eddie , of course , from second . Chapman from the dugout .
CHAPMAN: Okay , okay . Jesus .
BARBER'S VOICE: Robinson on first , Pete Reiser at at . Reiser belts it . A long one . Deep into left center . Back goes Ennis who is not tall enough . This one 's off the wall . Robinson is going to score from first .
JACK: Thanks .
STANKY: For what ? You 're on my team . What the hell am I supposed to do ?
SOFTLY: I got ta look in the mirror , too .
PREACHER: Lord , make me an instrument of you peace . Where there is hatred , let me sow love . Where there is injury , let me sow pardon . Where there is darkness , let me sow light .
HIGBE: I speak my mind and they trade me ! This ai n't the America I know !
WALKER: Where are they sending you , Hig ?
HIGBE: Pittsburgh ! For cash and some I- talian outfielder named Gionfriddo !
JOCKSTRAP: Pittsburgh
RICKEY: Do you remember the story , Burt , of the 99 sheep ? How one was missing ?
SHOTTON: If you 're talking about Dixie , I 'd leave the word sheep out of it .
RICKEY: I find myself at odds . I want integration and the pennant . I want to punish Dixie and at the same time I want his salvation .
SHOTTON: Ca n't he just be a good ballplayer ? He has to be a good person , too ?
RICKEY: It would be so much simpler if he was n't batting .385 .
WALKER: She 's all yours , Robinson . As THUNDER rumbles in the distance
PARROTT: The news is n't good , sir .
RICKEY: Nevertheless it must be accepted calmly , Harold . What is it ? A headline PLAYERS STRIKE . Parrott reads
PARROTT: A National League players ' strike instigated by some of the St. Louis Cardinals against the presence of Negro first baseman Jackie Robinson has been averted temporarily and perhaps permanently quashed .
RICKEY: Madness ! What are they thinking ? !
SMITH: Eddie , what 's all this talk about your Cardinals refusing to play ?
DYER: We 're here , are n't we ? We did n't come to New York to go to Macy 's .
SMITH: Hey , Garagiola
GARAGIOLA: Get lost .
SMITH: Hey , Stan , what 's the story ?
MUSIAL: This is big league baseball , not English tea . Couple a guys might 've popped off ; it 's hot air .
RICKEY: National League President Frick says this is America and baseball is America 's game . He says one citizen has as much right to play as another .
LOOKS UP: Baseball will go on as planned once the rain stops . Jack eyes his bat .
JACK: Why are you doing this , Mr. Rickey ?
RICKEY: Because my job is to win . I have an obligation to Brooklyn to put the best team on the field I can . Your presence on the roste increases our chances of winning . Not buying it , Jack looks over at him .
JACK: If this is winning , I 'd hate to see us on a losing streak .
BRANCA: Listen to this Right now Robinson is the loneliest man I have eve seen in sports .
UPSET: Who 's this guy to say Jackie 's lonely ? He does n't wear it on his sleeve . Man 's got one helluva game face . Take no prisoners . How does some reporter know how he feels .
BRANCA: Lonely ? I say its the best game face in the world .
WALKER: So long as he showers lonely , he can have whatever face he wants .
GARAGIOLA: Watch this guy ! He ca n't hit ! Especially the curve ! He can only get on base bunting ! As Jack digs into the box .
BARBER: Takes a fastball in on the hands . Robinson , who is pitched to a great deal that way , uses a thicke handle bat than most hitters , just ecause he hits a lot of balls out on his hands .
JACK: What 's your average , Joe ?
GARAGIOLA: It 'd be a lot higher than yours , if I could run as fast as you can .
JACK: No matter how fast you run , you 'll never hit as much as you weigh . Garagiola signals for another fastball .
GARAGIOLA: C'mon , Munger ! Boy 's got a hole in his bat ! Munger throws inside .
BARBER'S VOICE: That one was n't quite â€˜in ' enough . Robinson punishing the Redbirds with a smart piece of hitting .
RACHEL: Oh Jack
JACK: What is it , Rae ?
RACHEL: Nothing . It 's just , sometimes when I sit up there with those bastards , those loudmouths in the stands , I know you can hear them .
JACK: Do n't worry . It 's okay .
RACHEL: No , it 's not okay . And I can hea them , too . Jack looks at her , takes her hand in his .
JACK: I know . I 'm sorry for that . Rachel squeezes his hand back .
RACHEL: We 're in it together . When they start in on you , you know what I do ? I try to sit up as straight .
JACK: Yeah ?
RACHEL: Straight as I can .
JACK: It worked . I did n't hear a thing .
RACHEL: If they knew you , they 'd be ashamed .
JACK: Hold on .
RACHEL: I am holding on .
JACK: Long as we hold on , it 'll be okay .
RICKEY: You look lovely , Mrs. Robinson .
RACHEL: Thank you .
RICKEY: I do n't know how you do it . Every day , from the 1st to the 9th . Myself ? I could pay $ 100 for a suit and in twenty minutes I 'd look like I fell out of bed . Even my shoes look rumpled .
RACHEL: I used to think Jack was conceited .
RICKEY: Is that so ?
RACHEL: It was the very first thing I noticed about him .
RICKEY: How did you two meet ?
RACHEL: I saw him at a UCLA football game . Even in uniform with a helmet on , his vanity was awful . It was the way he held his hands on his hips . I hated him !
RICKEY LAUGHS: And on campus he always wore crisp white shirts and I 'd think his skin is so dark , why would he do that ? Then I got to know him , his pride and confidence , and I realized he was showing off his color . I was wrong . He was n't conceited ; he was proud . Always , of who and what he is . I 'd never met another man like that . What about you ? How did you meet your wife ?
RICKEY: Trying to catch her in a race . She was the fastest girl in town . Beautiful legs . I finally caught up ; we 've been together ever since .
RACHEL: For what ?
RICKEY: Everything . I ca n't apologize to him . He and I both knew what we were getting into . But you . A newlywed , trying to blossom a marriage under all this pressure .
RACHEL: Do n't worry about me . Or us . We know who we are . Crack . Jack hits another .
RICKEY: Your husband has humbled me . When this all began I thought I was changing the world and that Jackie was my instrument . Can you imagine ? I wish I could help him , ut I 'm just a spectator .
RACHEL: You help him plenty . Believe me . They watch him rip into another pitch .
RICKEY: Is he able to get things off his chest ? So he does n't burn up ?
RACHEL: Yes . I have to let him have that silence at first , let him come to me . But he opens up eventually .
RICKEY: Good . It 's too much to carry inside . Does he have any friends on the team ? They 're spectators , too . They do admire him though .
RACHEL: Do you think so ?
RICKEY: Even the worst of us recognizes courage . Moral courage especially . I have to think they see it . Jackie 's a man on trial . He 's esponding with glory and grace . No one can take their eyes off him .
RACHEL: He 's had himself on trial since the day I met him . No man is harder on himself or gets to himself worse than Jack . But I hope his team- mates know , they 're on trial too .
RICKEY: I suppose we all are . You 're an astute woman , Mrs. Robinson .
LAUGHS: I have to be , Mr. Rickey , I 'm married to a man of destiny . I ca n't let him down .
RICKEY: If I 'd met you first , I would n't have looked so long for Jackie .
RACHEL: How do you mean ?
RICKEY: I mean if he was good enough fo you , he 's certainly good enough fo the rest of us .
PENNOCK: Branch , it 's Herb .
RICKEY: What can I do for you , Herb ?
PENNOCK: How long have we known each other ?
RICKEY: Twenty years . Maybe more .
PENNOCK: Then trust me when I say , Brooklyn 's due here tomorrow , but you can not bring that Nigger down here with the rest of your team . Rickey grits his teeth , stays civil .
RICKEY: And why 's that , Herb ? His name 's Jackie Robinson by the way .
PENNOCK: We 're just not ready for this sort of thing in Philadelphia .
RICKEY: Herbert , what your team does is your decision . But my team is coming to Philadelphia . With Robinson . If we have to claim the game as a forfeit , we will . That 's 9-0 in case you forgot .
PENNOCK: Branch , you 've got one helluva hai across your ass on this thing and I , for one , would like to know what you 're trying to prove ?
RICKEY: Do you think God likes baseball ? I do .
PENNOCK: What the hell does that mean ?
RICKEY: It means you 're going to meet God one day , Herb , and when he inquires why Robinson was n't on the field in Philadelphia and you answer because he was a Negro , it may not be a sufficient reply . As Rickey hangs up the phone
PARROTT: Come on , fellas ! We have twenty minutes to check in and then get to Shibe ! Chop chop .
HOTEL MANAGER: Out ! Get that bus out of here !
PARROTT: We 're the Dodgers . We have a eservation .
HOTEL MANAGER: Your team 's not welcome , not while you have ballclub Negroes with you .
PARROTT: You mean Robinson ca n't stay here ?
HOTEL MANAGER: I mean the entire team is refused !
PARROTT: We 've been staying here ten years .
HOTEL MANAGER: And you can stay away that long !
SHOTTEN: Hold on now , let 's talk about this .
HOTEL MANAGER: Get out ! Now , grandpa !
SHOTTEN: Grandpa ? Hey hold on , you !
WALKER: Maybe 42 's got enough friends in town , we can bunk up .
JACK: What 's that supposed to mean ?
WALKER: Nothing . It 's just , I know when you ca n't get into a hotel , you got people 's houses you can stay at .
JACK: What do you want from me , Walker ?
WALKER: An apology .
STEPS FORWARD: For what ? Places like this ? Parrott alarmed at this turn of events .
WALKER: For turning this season into a sideshow ! I 'm a ballplayer ; I want to play ball !
JACK: So am I ! I 'm here to win !
WALKER: How the hell are we gon na win sleeping on the bus ? !
JACK: It might do you some good the way you 're swinging the bat lately .
DIXIE: Watch your mouth !
JACK: Watch your damn hand !
SHOTTEN: Grandpa ? ! I 'll show you grandpa !
PARROTT: Fellas ! Burt ! Please ! Take the us to the field ! Worry about the game . I 'll find another hotel .
PENNOCK: There is a great lynch mob among us ; they go unhooded and work without rope . That 's you , not me . We must remember that all this country 's enemies are not beyond the frontiers of our home land .
CHAPMAN: Some Jew must 've wrote that .
PENNOCK: This does n't look good , Ben ! It makes the Phillies , look racist ! You 've got to do something .
CHAPMAN: Me ? !
PARROTT: Jackie , excuse me , um , a request came in . The Phillies manager Ben Chapman , he 'd like his photo taken with you .
JACK: You been drinking , Harold ?
PARROTT: Mr. Rickey thinks it 's a good idea . He says it 'll be in every sports page in the country . An example that 'll show everyone even the most hardened man can change .
JACK: Chapman has n't changed . He 's just trying to take the heat off .
PARROTT: Mr. Rickey says it does n't matte if he 's changed . As long as it looks like he 's changed . Chapman said he 'd come down here . Or meet you in the runway . As Jack slow burns
SMITH: See the ball come in slow . See the photo come in slower .
TO PARROTT: Tell him on the field . Where everyone can see him . As Parrott smiles ; he 's done it .
PARROT: Perfect .
CHAPMAN: Jackie 's been accepted in baseball and the Philadelphia organization wish him all the luck we can . I only hope in some small way ou trial of fire helped him along . Jack looks at him Did he just say that ?
PHOTOGRAPHER: How about a picture ? Shake hands . Bury the hatchet ?
JACK: You want a picture ? Sure .
WALKER: Carl , I swear , I never thought I 'd see ol ' Ben eat shit like that .
BRANCA: Ostermeuller , you kraut ! You got ta at , too ! Do n't you forget !
OSTERMUELLER: I 'm ready , you Wop bastard !
BRANCA: It 's gon na come right between you eyes ! Like a Kamikaze !
BRANCA: You do n't belong here ! Go home to Goering and Shmelling !
OSTERMUELLER: Make me , you goddamn dago !
RICKEY: What can I do for you , Pee Wee ?
REESE: Well , Mr. Rickey , it 's like this , the series in Cincinnati next week .
RICKEY: It 's an important road trip , we 're only three games out of first .
REESE: Yes , sir . You know , I 'm from Kentucky .
RICKEY: Cincinnati 's nearly a home game fo you .
REESE: I got this letter , sir . I guess some people are n't too happy about me playing with Robinson .
RICKEY: Nigger lover . Watch yourself . We will get you , carpetbagger . Typical stuff . Reese takes the letter back , a little hurt .
REESE: It 's not typical to me .
RICKEY: How many of these letters have you gotten , Pee Wee ?
REESE: Just this . Ai n't that enough ?
RICKEY: I 'll tell you what they are n't , they are n't letters from the Jackie Robinson fan club . Here
REESE: Get out of baseball , or your baby oy will die .
RICKEY: Of course he knows . And the FBI . They 're taking a threat in Cincinnati pretty seriously . So excuse me if I 'm not too shocked at you being called a carpetbagger . You should be proud of it !
REESE: We 'd just like to play ball , Mr. Rickey . That 's all we want to do .
RICKEY: I understand . I bet Jackie just wants to play ball . I bet he wishes he was n't leading the league in hit y pitch . I bet he wishes people did n't want to kill him . But the world is n't so simple anymore . I 'm not sure it ever was . We just , aseball ignored it . Now we ca n't .
QUIET: Yes , Sir . I got ta get to practice .
FRECKLES: Nigger ! We do n't want you here !
A BEAT: Ask any man and they 'll tell you that the Gillette Superspeed razo is a honey . Maybe the sweetest shaving razor you 'll ever use .
JACK: What 's up ?
REESE: They can say what they want ; we 're here to play baseball .
JACK: Just a bunch of crackpots still fighting the Civil War .
REESE: Hell , we 'd a won that son of a gun if the cornstalks had held out . We just ran out of ammunition .
JACK: Better luck next time , Pee Wee .
REESE: Ai n't gon na be a next time . All we got is right now . This right here . Know what I mean ?
JACK: What 're you thanking me for ?
REESE: I 've got family here from Louisville . Up there somewhere . I need â€˜em to know who I am .
UMPIRE: Hey ! Number one ! You playing ball or socializing ?
REESE: Playing ball , ump ! Playing ball !
TO JACK: Maybe tomorrow we 'll all wear 42 . That way they wo n't be able to tell us apart .
BRANCA: You ever write about white guys in your paper ? I mean , if I threw a no hitter and Jackie got a base hit , what would the headline be ?
SMITH: Jackie leads Dodgers to victory . Again . Under that white Italian guy does ok . They all laugh .
REESE: I 'd call your folks for ya , Ralph . Tell â€˜em how you did .
BRANCA: No problem . It 'll still make the Post . They play their hands as they talk .
REESE: We are on some kind of winning streak , huh boys ? And I do n't mean cards .
BRANCA: Hey , maybe forty of our last fifty .
SMITH: Thirty-two and fifteen actually . Since the 4th of July .
BRANCA: Math is why I throw a baseball fo a living .
REESE: This next series against the Cardinals , it 's a big one .
JACK: Gin .
STANKY: Next batter , throw right at his head . Clean his clock
FIERCE: Just get him out . Understand ? Game 's too important .
BARBER'S VOICE: The top of the 12th and Kurowski at the plate . He hit his 20th home un on Monday so Casey 's going to want to be careful with him . The pitch grooves in and Kurowski nails it .
JACK: I do n't care what happens , I do n't care what kind of play it is , when I get to second I 'm gon na knock someone into centerfield .
MUSIAL: I do n't blame you , man , you got every right .

CATES: The truth hurts , does n't it , buddy ? Cates looks at the Old Cop .
OLD COP: It do n't figure .
CATES: I need to borrow a piece . The OLD COP shrugs looks in his desk
YOUNG COP: Somebody steals your gun , you 're supposed to file a report .
CATES: Are you gon na tell me about police procedure ? Do me a favor , do n't give me a bunch of crap .
YOUNG COP: I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible
CATES: Just shut the fuck up .
HADEN: Cates , I 'll need to see you in five minutes , exactly five .
OLD COP: Best I can do .
HADEN: D'you read me , Cates Haden continues moving away .
CATES: Five minutes . I heard you , you voice carries
RUTH: They 're still wet .
POLICEWOMAN: You 're an accessory to Murder One , so you 're going to have to do a whole lot better than what we got down here , honey
LISA: Gim me a break , huh ? Look , I got there . He was a trick just like any other for all I knew . That 's all there is . He did n't feel like sitting and talking . He was in a big hurry to get laid . I was with him about an hour
DETECTIVE: We got a print from the hotel oom . Guy 's real name is Ganz , Albert Ganz . A hitter from back East but he worked out here a few years back . Armed robbery . Broke out of prison two days ago and capped two of the guards . A real animal . Wait 'll you see this
CATES: Did he give you a return match ?
LISA: He was n't interested .
CATES: Maybe he did n't like you performance .
LISA: Fuck you .
CATES: I 'll take a raincheck
RUTH: This 'll interest you , Jackwe 've got something here from you gun and these are from the first weapon Ganz used
CATES: I do n't get it .
RUTH: Here .
RUTH: A perfect match for the markings from the first gun he used but not from the Walden Hotel fired at least six hours earlierat point blank range right between the eyes . Found him on a park ench
CATES: Look at it this way , Ruth . If there were n't , what would there be for us to do ? Lisa continues with the Policewoman .
LISA: Anyway so I got there and took him down . He started watching television and then you sensational people started banging on the door that 's all except he 's gon na give you guys a hard time .
POLICEWOMAN: What makes you think so ?
LISA: I think he liked shooting cops a lot more than getting laid . Cates watches Kehoe unpack the box .
CATES: Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel ?
KEHOE: Every last bit of it . The big guy 's room was empty .
CATES: I 'll help you out .
KEHOE: This guy must have had a .44 like yours , Jack . Now he 's got yours .
CATES: Shit . Kehoe next produces several boxes of shells .
KEHOE: This cat was real serious about his artillery .
CATES: Billy Bear
KEHOE: Backup man from the East Bay . Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang .
CATES: Who are all these ?
KEHOE: They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago .
CATES: Wait a minute , wait a minute who 's this ?
KEHOE: Uhh Wong , Henry Wong . He was in on the same job .
CATES: Tell me that 's not the same guy .
KEHOE: Hey Dick Tracy .
RUTH: Did Ganz have a grudge against his old friends ? Haden comes out of his office .
HADEN: Get in here , Cates . Cates ignores him .
CATES: I think I wan na have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking . Can we find them ?
KEHOE: Here 's the file . Cates checks the file .
CATES: One of em 's in the slam .
HADEN: Damn you , Cates Get in here . Cates walks into Haden 's cubicle .
CATES: I want to be left alone on this one . Algren was killed with my gun .
HADEN: Yeah , I read the report
CATES: Hey , the bastard 's got my gun . I want it back .
HADEN: Jack , come on , there is an official department policy about cop killings . Cop killers epresent a special priority ecause any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian In othe words , we ca n't seen like we 're in the revenge business I know , we all know the truth 's a little different . Cates almost smiles at Haden .
CATES: Yeah
HADEN: Anthing botherin ' you besides losin ' your gun ?
CATES: Yeah . It bothers me when cops get hurt while I 'm makin ' a play . I do n't like it .
HADEN: You might be more of a team playe and a little less of a hot dog on this one , Jack .
CATES: Being a hot dog 's worked pretty well for me so far Besides , I got a lead
HADEN: Okay . You 're not a team player . You got ta do things your own way . Fine . Nail this guy and make us all look good . But you bette watch your ass . If you screw up , I can promise you , you 're goin ' down .
CATES: You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude . He starts to go .

CATES: Sure , okay , fine , no problem See , there 's this kid in jail First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows He points to the file .
ELAINE: I thought you might come over to my place to recuperate . I do n't have to go to work until the day after tomorrow . They begin to stroll down the street .
CATES: I got nothing to recuperate from . There 's a guy out there with my gun , and I want it back . She 's not happy with this attitude .
ELAINE: Look , spare me the macho bullshit about your gun
CATES: Bullshit ? I 'll tell you about ullshit . My gun 's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it . It is n't my macho bullshit that 's killing people , my gun is
ELAINE: Look , Jack , if you make everything your personal responsibility , you 'll turn into a bad cop . It 's not a practical way to function
CATES: I did n't get burned , two cops did . Listen , I 'll tell you about personnel responsibility . I like to get the job done right . And if I do n't get my job done right I 'm for shit .
ELAINE: Here it comes again the sacred job
CATES: That 's right . I 'm not like you . I 'm not gon na sit on my ass wondering what 's right and what 's wrong There 's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I 'm gon na get him . Because it 's my job . And if you do n't get that

HAMMOND: Ganz ? Pause .

HAMMOND: Ganz is in jail . He 's gon na be there two years after I 'm on the street .

HAMMOND: What are you talkin ' about ? This suit 's mine . It cost $ 900 . Hammond dusts off a sleeve .
CATES: We 're supposed to be after a killer , not a string of hookers
HAMMOND: Listen , it may be a little out of date . You know , I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies Cates hands some papers to the Guard .
GUARD: He 's all yours .
HAMMOND: We could change this for something goodGet you lookin ' sharp fo pussy . Cates gives him a look .
CATES: I do n't need to hear your jive . I already got that department taken care of
HAMMOND: You got a girl shit the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me .

HAMMOND: No way to start a partnership .
CATES: Get this . We ai n't partners . We ai n't brothers . We ai n't friends . I 'm puttin ' you down and keepin ' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead . And if Ganz gets away , you 're gon na be sorry we ever met .

HAMMOND: What gang you talkin ' about , Jack ?
CATES: I can read a police file , shithead , and quit calling me Jack .
HAMMOND: Just an expression man , do n't mean nothin ' .
CATES: I do n't give a damn . It happens to be my name .
HAMMOND: Then what 're you complainin ' about ? At least nobody 's calling you shithead .
CATES: I may call you worse than that . Cates drives off .
HAMMOND: Just up the street , the othe side , over there Now , do n't other knockin ' on the door . Luther ai n't the kind of guy that looks for company .
CATES: Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ?
HAMMOND: Luther ai n't the reliable type . I do n't want you shot yet , Cates not before you been a help to me .
CATES: I 'm helpin ' you , huh ? Hammond smiles .

HAMMOND: Mission District . Gon na find us an Indian .
CATES: I do n't give out the details .
HAMMOND: Last night , two nights ago , three ? Cates keeps smiling .
CATES: Last night .
HAMMOND: You have a good time ?
CATES: Sure . Then we had a fight this morning .
HAMMOND: At least you took care of business and got the important part in efore she came down on youTell me a little about her . She got great tits ? Cates gives him a hard look .
CATES: I get the feeling it 's going to be eal long night . They keep driving .
HAMMOND: It 's a long shot , butBilly used to tend bar here a few years back . I heard him talk about it .
CATES: This part of town , they 'll make us for heat the second we walk in . Just back me up like you 've got a piece
HAMMOND: Back you up ? Now why would I wan na do that ?
CATES: If they kick my ass , they 'll sure as hell carve yours up
HAMMOND: But you can handle it all right , huh ? Real amazin ' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats
CATES: Bullshit . Attitude and experience get you through
HAMMOND: I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers . All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge
CATES: You need five years training to handle a joint like Hamnond 's had enough of this debate .
HAMMOND: Hey , you wan na bet ?
CATES: I got two problems . Number one , I 'm not playin ' games . Numbe two , you got nothin ' to bet with .
HAMMOND: If we come outta this joint with Ganz ' phone number , or a dead Indian , or anything else useful , then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid
CATES: Why ? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably ca n't get it up anyway .
HAMMOND: That 's never been one of my problems . Now , stop stallin ' , man , or else admit all this professional stuff you 're talkin ' about is a crock of shit .
CATES: I 'll tell you what happens if you lose you tell the truth fo once .
HAMMOND: What are you talkin ' about ?
CATES: You tell me what Ganz busted out for , he 's after a lot more than just gettin ' out of jail . And whatever it is , you 're part of it .
HAMMOND: I do n't know what you 're talking about . I just wan na see Ganz nailed .
CATES: The bet 's off . Hammond thinks it over..
HAMMOND: Okay , if I lose , I 'll tell you anything you want to know Cates reaches into his pocket .
CATES: I 'm gon na enjoy this here , I 'll even loan you my badge .
HAMMOND: I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes .
HAMMOND: This place do n't seem real popula with the brothers .
CATES: My kind of place . I always liked country boys .
BARTENDER: Yeah .
HAMMOND: Vodka .
BARTENDER: Maybe you better have a Black Russian .
HAMMOND: No , man , I think I 'll have a vodka . Hamnond looks around the room .
HAMMOND: You know a big Indian named Billy Bear ? He used to work here .
BARTENDER: Never heard of him .
HAMMOND: Now how 's your memory doin ' ?
BARTENDER: Fuck off . I do n't know what the hell you 're talkin ' about .
HAMMOND: Maybe I better ask around , see what your pals think .
BARTENDER: I do n't give a shit who you ask . The Bartender walks down toward Cates .
CATES: Some of us citizens are with you all the way , Officer .
HAMMOND: You 're in trouble , big trouble , so you better start talking . Where 'd a boy like you make a score like this ?
PUNK: It 's mine , what the hell
HAMMOND: You must a rolled somebody . They do n't let punks like you take jobs that pay this much you sure you do n't know a dangerous Indian , ecause unless you start talkin ' I may just have to start looking down your pants with a flashlight
PUNK: What kind of cop are you , anyway ?
HAMMOND: I am your most terrible nightmare a bad nigger with a badge that entitles him to kick your ass Hammond turns to the Bartender
BARTENDER: Okay , okay . The Indian hangs out with a girl down the block . Right where Chinatown starts . She lives on top of the hardware store .
HAMMOND: I do n't give a damn about his girl
BARTENDER: Look , give me a break , you 're going to have to settle for he place . It 's the only thing I know . He looks desperate .
HAMMOND: Try obeyin ' the law once in awhile , and I wo n't have to hassle you Turns to go , then turns back .
CATES: I think you got something for me . Pause .
HAMMOND: You made that move , huh ?
CATES: While you 're at it , You can give me the switchblade , too .
HAMMOND: You already got a gun and you owe me a piece of ass . I 'll settle for the gun you just took .
CATES: You did a real good job Guess you deserve a reward .
HAMMOND: Motherfucker . He throws the gun away .
CATES: I sure am . Now let 's go get us an Indian . They walk up the block .
HAMMOND: What the shit is that ?
CATES: There .
HAMMOND: Must be billy 's girl .
CATES: Come on .
CATES: Police ! Nobody move !
SALLY: You better drop it or he 's gon na get another one .
HAMMOND: Hey , talk to here jack . I do n't feel like gettin ' number two along side of the head .
CATES: I said police . Now drop the goddamn gun .
CASEY: Do n't give me that police shit . You drop it . Pause .
CATES: Okay , look , do n't shoot . I 'm just eachin ' for my badge . Cates takes out his badge-Shows it to Casey .
CASEY: I do n't like this bullshit . I 've seen fake badges before .
HAMMOND: I 'll tell you something lady , this guy is a real nervous cop - He 's just liable to pull the trigger . Cates takes two steps toward Casey
CATES: Naw , I 'm the calm type . I know you do n't want me to shoot you , and I know that you do n't want to shoot me . He takes two more steps toward her .
CASEY: You assholes better be real .
SALLY: Just wait a Goddamn second here , let 's see your badge He snatches the bat out of her hands .
HAMMOND: Do n't have one .
SALLY: I knew it . Call the cops . Casey walks over to the phone .
CATES: Tell them it 's Cates , Detective 31st District . Then put you clothes on . If you do n't answe some questions I 'm taking both your asses in . After a moment , Casey puts down the phone .
SALLY: None of your business , cop . The son of a bitch is n't here , and he is n't coming back .
CATES: You can do better than that . Turns to Casey .
CASEY: I used to go with himI do n't know where the hell he is . I have n't seen him for two weeks . And I do n't think I will . He owes me money
SALLY: He 's a Goddamn lowlife , the way he treated her .
CATES: Sounds like a real stormy romance .
CASEY: I do n't much care what it sounds like to you , Cop . All I know is that I went a few laps around the track with him and I ended up with nothin ' but the short end of the stick . Cates looks over at Hammond .
CATES: Let 's go .
HAMMOND: Wait a minute . Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us . How about it ? I been nearly three years in prison and
SALLY: Fuck off .
CATES: Come on Hannond starts for the door with Cates .
CASEY: If you find that bastard , Billy , tell him to stay out of my life . I do n't need any more of his macho ullshit .
CATES: This sucks . A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it . So , instead of me being where I oughta be , which is in bed giving my girl the high , hard one , I 'm out here doing this shit , roaming around with some overdressed , charcoal-colored loser like you .
HAMMOND: You wan na leave , man ? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself .
CATES: You ? Do n't make me laugh . You ca n't take care of shit . You 've een dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt . All you 're good for is games So far , what I got outta you is nothin '
HAMMOND: I 'm impressed with you too , Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night .
CATES: Luther knew more than he told me and so do youNow you bette tell we what the fuck this is all about . I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock 's runnin ' A long look at Hammond .
HAMMOND: Maybe I do n't like the way you ask .
CATES: Who gives a Goddamn what you think ? You 're just a crook that 's got a weekendpass You 're not even a name anymore . Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn numbe stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues They walk past .
HAMMOND: You beat the shit out of me ? Do n't make me laugh , sucker . You do n't know how I 'd dance on you face ? I 'll hit you so hard , so many times , you 'll wish you 'd never been hatched . I 'll turn your face into cottage cheese . I 'll make your girl think you been takin ' ugly pills . She wo n't even know who you are , sucker .
CATES: I guess the first thing I ought , to explain to you , nigger , is I fight dirty .
HAMMOND: So do I .

FIRST COP: All right , you two . Do n't move .
CATES: NO , noit 's okayI 'm police .
SECOND COP: Yeah , sure . Get your hands above your head .
CATES: My gun and badge are over there . And I 'm too fucking tired to raise my hands
FIRST COP: What the hell 's going on here ? Cates walks over , pockets his gun .
SECOND COP: I 've got a burglary call . Two women say a couple of hoods broke into their place posing as cops .
CATES: I was following a lead . We ousted them Go up and sweet talk 'em . You can straighten it out .
FIRST COP: Why do n't you do it ? We got etter things to do than straighten out your messes .
CATES: So do I. I 'll file a report tomorrow .
FIRST COP: I got ta file a..Report tonight asshole
CATES: Goes with the territory .
HAMMOND: Too bad we got interrupted when we did . I was getting ready to finish you off . Cates straightens up from the wash basin .
CATES: Yeah , right . You want to try again ?
HAMMOND: Naw , you 'd just call your pals ack to bail you out one more time .
CATES: They saved your ass , convict .
HAMMOND: One thing 's for sure , Jack . That 's how you 'll tell the story .
CATES: I 'll even put it in my report that way .
HAMMOND: Motherfucker .
CATES: Wait a minute . Hammond stops .
HAMMOND: I been waiting a long time fo some money .
CATES: How much ?
HAMMOND: Half a million .
CATES: Jesus . Hammond smiles his meanest smile .
HAMMOND: How 's that for a number to give you heart failure ? Guess you might start to get the picture afte all . Mlaybe you 're on the wrong side of the old law and orde usiness.. Cates is unmoved .
CATES: Just tell me about the money .
HAMMOND: Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale . It 's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen . I was sittin ' pretty , livin ' in the high cotton , then somebody fingered me for anothe job . Some psycho who 's out there capping people with some cop 's gun .
CATES: He 's after your money .
HAMMOND: You catch on real fastOkay , Jack , let 's talk deal . How much of my money you gon na let me keep ? Cates just looks at him .
CATES: Not likely , convict .
HAMMOND: You gon na let me keep any of it ?
CATES: Depends on how things work out . I elieve in the merit system . So far you have n't built up any points . He smiles .
HAMMOND: Okay , from now on , I 'm gon na be eal good , Jack . Cates smiles back .
CATES: Where 's the money ?
HAMMOND: In the trunk of a car . A lot etter than under a mattress , ight ? Cates smiles .
CATES: Right , partner .
HAMMOND: Get this . We ai n't partners . We ai n't brothers . We ai n't friends . If Ganz gets away with my money , you 're gon na be sorry we ever met .
CATES: Yeah . Right . They get into the Caddy . Boom away .
HAMMOND: You 're a real case , you know that , Jack ? Smiles .
CATES: For three years ? Let 's hope it was n't a tow-away zone .
HAMMOND: You just drove by it .
CATES: Okay , now what ? Hammond gets out of the car . Stands on the sidewalk . Stretches . Then gets into the back seats .
HAMMOND: Since you 're wired on benniest you get to stay up and stare at the uilding . I 'm tired , so I 'm going to sleep . They take Sunday off . Place opens at seven o'clock Monday morning . Wake me up at a quarter till Cates stares at the place .
CATES: You son of a bitch . You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait . I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing .
HAMMOND: I was n't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther . You almost got your ass shot off fo nothing once , not twice , Jack .
CATES: Shit .
CATES: I do n't want you sleeping on the job .
HAMMOND: The place opens in five minutes . Ganz ought to be here soon
CATES: You took a big chance , leaving this here all this time .
HAMMOND: Not really . I figured Ganz was put down for a long time . And I knew Luther would never job me on his own . He 's too chickenshit .
CATES: Guess what ? Luther just got in line . Hammond sits up .
HAMMOND: What ?
CATES: Musta got some primo bondsman .
HAMMOND: Jesus Christ . That 's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he 's out in 24 hours . I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door .
ATTENDANT: Yeah ?
LUTHER: I want to pick up my car . He passes across a faded form .
ATTENDANT: Name ?
LUTHER: Hammond . The Attendant examines the form , surprised .
ATTENDANT: This is three years old .
LUTHER: Yeah , I 've been busy .
ATTENDANT: We do n't wash 'em , ya know .
LUTHER: How about chargin ' the battery ?
ATTENDANT: That we do . And we put air in the tires . I 'll even sell you some gas if you need it .
LUTHER: Great , just great .
HAMMOND: Jesus Christ , look at all the dust on my carwhy in the hell do n't he take it to a car wash ?
CATES: Did n't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs .
HAMMOND: I had no choice . Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac .
CATES: You 'd think the guy 'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed .
HAMMOND: Tryin ' to save his girl , man . He 's in another world .
CATES: If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass , I 'd just leave town .
HAMMOND: I 'm tellin ' you the man 's in love he wants to be a hero fo his girl .
CATES: Oh , yeah , does bein ' in love make you stupid ?
CATES: I suppose you 'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you
HAMMOND: I let women get to me . The quest for pussy is the meaning of life I got my own personal philosophy about 'em . Keep women separate from guns , money and usiness women are fo spending money . They got nothing to do with helping you make it .
CATES: That ai n't philosophy . That 's common sense .
HAMMOND: Say , do you always work people over like you did Luther ?
CATES: If they do n't tell me what I need to know
HAMMOND: Does n't it get Tiring ?
CATES: I 'm not in this 'cause it 's fun . I 'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either I do it 'cause it works-
HAMMOND: You got a very depressing view of life , man you got ta smile once in awhile
CATES: Maybe Luther hopes Ganz 'll give him a piece of your money
HAMMOND: If he 's hoping that then he 's dumber than I think he is , which would be amazin ' , cause I already think he 's real dumb .
HAMMOND: A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
CATES: Yeah , it does n't look like he 's gon na make it as a dangerous tough guy
HAMMOND: You know , I 'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you 've done with this job .
CATES: What you do n't understand is , I do n't give a damn about how this thing looks .
HAMMOND: No class
CATES: Class is n't somethin ' you buy , punk . Look at you , five hundred dollar suit and you 're still a lowlife .
HAMMOND: We 're getting too close Cates , what 's the matter , you been takin ' dumb pills ?
CATES: Yeah , most cops are pretty dumb But since you 're the one that landed in jail what 's that make you ?
CATES: That Goddamn suit is yours ? Hammond winces .
HAMMOND: That was in style a couple years ack , man .
CATES: Right . if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping , then you 're all set .
HAMMOND: That 's the money , Jack . They jump out of the car , follow on foot .
PATROLMAN: Heyyou !
HAMMOND: Shoot the sons of bitches . Cates ca n't risk it
CATES: You stay with me
HAMMOND: No way
SECURITY OFFICER: Freeze !
CATES: No ! No ! There they are !
SECURITY OFFICER: Just put it down real slow . The train doors close .
CATES: I 'm a policeman , you asshole !
SECURITY OFFICER: Do n't even try now drop it or - you 're all done .
CATES: Shit .
HADEN: Cates .
CATES: I lost them , that 's what happened .
HADEN: How did they get away ?
CATES: They ran . As fast as they could . Caught a train .
HADEN: Which one pulled the trigger ?
CATES: The Indian . I was about 30 yards away .
HADEN: You could n't get to him ? Cates shrugs .
CATES: Right . I screwed up . I fucked up . I messed up . Anybody could have done better , especially you . I bet you 're real good at hitting targets through crowds .
HADEN: Do n't duck the bullet Cates . Why did n't you call in for backup instead of makin ' a grandstand play ?
CATES: I did n't have the time .
HADEN: Too bad , it would 've covered you ass . Now you 're in the shit and so 's the department . In case you have n't noticed , this was n't ou finest hour I told you everyone was watchin ' on this one . Maybe you better start thinkin ' about writin ' tickets off a three wheel ike . Cates looks at Haden for a moment Turns and walks away .
SOSNA: Not bad , not bad . Puts the suitcase down on the table .
HAMMOND: Naw , right here 's okay . Dancers sliding and jerking in front of them .
SOSNA: You sure ?
HAMMOND: I 'm sure . Everybody here 's looking at everybody else 's ass .
SOSNA: I got some real nice merchandise . All of it 's clean .
HAMMOND: I like this one Pockets a revolver with a deft move .
SOSNA: It 's loaded I got some shells in here .
HAMMOND: How much ?
SOSNA: This is clean shit . No serial numbers and never been used
HAMMOND: Do n't mess with me . How much ?
SOSNA: Five bills .
HAMMOND: Five . On credit .
SOSNA: This ai n't a credit business . You know that .
HAMMOND: Yeah , I know that , but this is me and we 're old friends . I have n't got the money so what are you gon na do about it ?
SOSNA: Give it back .
HAMMOND: Try and take it . A long moment .
SOSNA: Fuck you . You got no right fo this kind of play .
HAMMOND: I 'll got your money to you . No sweat . Hammonds heads for the bar .
RITA: So what ?
HAMMOND: Hi there . I 'm Reggie Hammond .
ANGELA: I 'm with somebody . She turns away .
HAMMOND: This ai n't my night . He drinks up .
KEHOE: You look awful .

KEHOE: Long night , too , from what I heard Word 's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time , and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman , some jig beat the crap out of you .

CATES: Nothing came in for me yet ? No calls ?
KEHOE: Nothing .
CATES: Hello Yeah , okay . I 'll be in tomorrow . That 's right , you can depend on it . Okay ?

HAMMOND: We do n't have too many cheerleaders in prison . I though I might indulge myself in a little trim . Cates orders two drinks .
CATES: Tell me something . Why did n't you just take the money off Luther and split ?
HAMMOND: Forget it . I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you
CATES: I do n't know why , but I 'm going to let you keep it . Maybe because you told me you had it , or maybe just ecause I 'm too tired to argue
HAMMOND: You sure that 's the reason ? Pause .
CATES: Thanks for callin ' in and I guess Maybe Look , I 'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger those kinds of things . I was just leanin ' on ya , doin ' my job .

HADEN: Just cause you say it with conviction do n't mean shit to me How you gon na take to a pink slip , huh ? .
CATES: I 'm taking my prisoner back to jail . Hammond looks at Haden .
HAMMOND: Goin ' a little hard on him , are n't you ?
HADEN: Go fuck yourself convict .
HAMMOND: You know for a man , you have very pretty brown eyes . Cates and Hammond walk out .

CATES: Naw , you did n't let me down . It was a long shot all the way . We gave 'em a good run at it .
HAMMOND: Yeah , but we did n't get 'em . They get in and drive off .

CATES: How do you know ?
ELAINE: Jack , it 's all over the papers . He 's an obvious type . But this Indian Hammond cuts in .
HAMMOND: He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend He was loyal , went all the way for you
ELAINE: In all due respect , he sounds kind of pathetic to me . The kind of guy that runs home to his momma o some girlfriend . Have you two ace detectives checked that out ?
CATES: Yeah , well the only woman of the Indian 's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend . I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet They oth looked mad enough to kill him

ELAINE: What makes you think they were lesbians , or as you so quaintly put it , dykes ?
CATES: Come on , they were a little old for a slumber party .
ELAINE: It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions . I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week , Jack , and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian Now , if this Indian 's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him , it could just be she 's still vulnerable to him .
CATES: So what ?

RECEPTIONIST: Can I help you ?
ADAM: I have an appointment .
RECEPTIONIST: Name ?
ADAM: Adam Schwartz .
CONFUSED: Um , am I supposed to go somewhere ?
RECEPTIONIST: Adam Schwartz .
ADAM: Yeah , that 's me .
RECEPTIONIST: Follow me .
ADAM: Do I need to take off all my clothes ? The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam .
NURSE JOANNE: Hi Adam , my name is Joanne , so nice to meet you .
ADAM: You do n't happen to have anything in a cotton blend ?
NURSE JOANNE: Cotton . You 're funny .
ADAM: You want me to fill this entire cup .

JOANNE: Take it home . You 're so funny .
ADAM: Just another minute .
JOANNE: Here comes the choo-choo !
AUTHORITATIVELY: Now make sure you lie completely still . Otherwise we 'll have to do it all over again . Which we 're not going to have to do , right ?
ADAM: Hello ? Is anybody out there ?
RACHEL: Make it stop .
ADAM: It wo n't turn off .
WHISPERS: Sorry .
RACHEL: Mmmmm .
ADAM: What ?
RACHEL: I think you have a gray hair .
ADAM: Really ?
RACHEL: I 'm gon na pull it out .
ADAM: No ! Do n't touch it .
SETH: Hi kids . Beautiful day is n't it ?
ANDREW: Hey Adam .
ADAM: Hey Andrew .
ANDREW: Sorry about the noise last night .
SETH: Yo .
ADAM: Yo .
SETH: What 's that smell ?
SNIFFS ADAM: Are you wearing perfume ?
ADAM: No .
SETH: Well , you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias .
ADAM: I ran out of shampoo . I had to use Rachel 's .
SETH: For a second there I thought maybe you 'd fucked Olympia Dukakis .
ADAM: Can you unlock my window ? There 's a lot of pollen in the air . Seth ignores Adam and turns up the music .
ANNOYED: Seriously , my allergies are flaring up . It feels like my nasal cavities are on fire .
SETH: Sorry music 's too loud , it 's making it hard for me to hear you whining .
ADAM: Rachel and I used to be like that ; like two wild animals in heat
THINKS: I guess it is only natural though , as we get older , more mature , things begin to slow down .
BEAT: Sex every three weeks is normal ? Right ?
SETH: You have n't had sex in three weeks ?
ADAM: You think maybe she 's mad cause I have n't asked her to move in ?
SETH: What the fuck are you talking about ? I do n't think she 's waiting for you to ask anything . You 're using her shampoo . Next thing you 'll be using her tampons .
ADAM: It 's not that big a deal .
SETH: So when does it become a big deal ? Five weeks ? Six weeks ? A year ? My cut off4 days . That 's when I egin to worry .
ADAM: Do you realize how lucky I am to be with Rachel ?
SETH: Look around , there are like a million Rachel 's in this city alonewell , she 's kind of hot , so maybe half a million .
ADAM: But they 're not Rachel . I do n't know how to explain it , but being with her just feels right . And I 'm not going to overlook that just cause we 're in a lull .
SETH: My parents are in a lull , which is what happens after 35 years of marriage . You 've only been dating her four months . At our age sex is all we have . Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man 's soul dies . She 's killing us AdamYou 're a semi- smart , semi-successful , semi- average looking dude . Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population .
BARISTA: Morning gentlemen .
SETH: Would you sleep with my friend .
BARISTA: Like , right now ?
SETH: No just in general .
BARISTA: Yeah , I 'd fuck him .
DEMETRI: I 'd let you blow me .
SETH: See this is what I 'm saying .
PHIL: Salutations gentlemen . Phil sniffs the air and looks at Adam .
ADAM: It 's Rachel 's shampoo .
PHIL: Fructis by L'oreal .
IMPRESSED: My wife uses that .
TO SETH: What are you wearing ?
SETH: Ah , mothballs ?
PHIL: How 's the Origins exhibit coming along ?
ADAM: We 're almost done with Uppe Paleolithic .
PHIL: I 'm counting on you not to screw up . You 're the only one I can trust .
BEAT: 13 .
ADAM: Phil ?
PHIL: Yeah ?
ADAM: I should probably get to work .
PHIL: That 's probably a good idea . Phil looks at the clock - 10 a.m .
ADAM: Greg . What are you doing ?
GREG: It 's a velociraptor .
ADAM: Where did it come from ?
GREG: The dinosaur exhibit . Why ca n't we just say it was the first domesticated pet ? People love dinosaurs .
ADAM: Greg you ca n't justthat 's a 75 million year old fossiljust please , put it away before someone sees it .
SETH: Coming up here on our left is the `` Origins of Man '' exhibit on loan from the Smithsonian Institute . It wo n't be open to the public for a few more months , so you 're one of the first groups to see it .
SPOTS ADAM: Adam ! Adam looks up . He hates this part of his job .
ADAM: Hey kids .
SETH: Why do n't you tell us what we 're looking at .
ADAM: This here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in Europe about 25,000 year 's ago
KID 1: This is lame ! I thought you said we were gon na see dinosaurs .
GREG: See , I told you .
SETH: Who wants to hear about the caveman ?
ADAM: This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the Neanderthal Man . For over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of Europe . But then about 30,000 years ago , Neanderthals began to disappear , until one day , thei entire civilization was gone .
GREG: What happened ?
ADAM: Greg you know what happened .
GREG: I do ?
SETH: Come on ! Tell us what happened to the caveman .
ADAM: Well no one knows for sure . But it 's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman , he roamed the land , only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others . So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe , they took over the land . One by one , Neanderthal was pushed outand never seen , or heard from again .
SETH: That 's quite a story . Thank you Adam .
ADAM: But you never know , just cause they vanished does n't mean they 're gone . For all we know , there could be a Neanderthal walking among us right now . And by the looks of this guy
KID 1: This sucks ass .
SETH: I see dinosaurs .
DR. ROSS: Patient has been complaining of excessive urination , back pain , and night sweats . Blood tests and urine analysis are normal . MRI indicates a massive intraduaral extradural
MALIGNANT SCHWANNOMA: neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion .
ADAM: I have no idea what you just said . Is there something wrong with me ?
DR. ROSS: If you look here on your MRI , you see this cephalopod like object spreading down along your spinal column ? Adam squints . It all looks the same .
ADAM: I still have no idea what you 're talking about .
DR. ROSS: It 's a malignant tumor .
ADAM: What ? ! A tumor ? No .
DR. ROSS: I 'm afraid so .
ADAM: How is that possible ? I do n't smoke . I do n't drink . I eat healthyI even recycle .
DR. ROSS: Well Adam it 's actually quite fascinating . Your cancer is the esult of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 Gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves . In your case it 's grown along the nerves in your lowe spine . Adam looks at himself in the mirror .
ADAM: But , look at me . I do n't look sick .
DR. ROSS: Cancer often has no specific symptoms . People can go years with out knowing they 're sick . We 're lucky we caught it before it metastasizes .
MORE: 19 .
BEAT: I 'm going to put you on a 4 month egimen of chemotherapy . It 's an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work .
ADAM: Ca n't you just cut it out of me ?
DR. ROSS: Yes , that is an option . But because the tumor has spread to a such significant size . Cutting it out now would be risky .
ADAM: Well what are my chances of beating this ?
LIBRARIAN: Hey bro , time 's up . Startled . Adam looks up at the librarian .
ADAM: Can I have just a few more minutes ?
LIBRARIAN: Sorry bro . Twenty minute limit .
EMBARRASSED: Rules .
ADAM: Nothing .
RACHEL: Liar . This is not going to be easy .
ADAM: We need to talk . Rachel drops the accent . This seems serious .
RACHEL: Why ? What 's going on ?
ADAM: I had a doctor 's appointment today .
RACHEL: What kind of doctor 's appointment ? Adam has no idea what to say .
ADAM: Have you ever seen the movie `` Beaches '' ?
RACHEL: You mean with Bette Midler ?
ADAM: Yeah that one .
RACHEL: Not as good as `` The Rose '' , but good .
ADAM: Remember the end of `` Beaches '' ?
RACHEL: Yeah . Sad.What does that have to do with you ?
ADAM: I do n't know .
RACHEL: You do n't know ?
ADAM: Well I do know , but I ca n't pronounce it . Neuroscharnoma o something .
RACHEL: Well how bad is it ?
ADAM: It 's not good .
RACHEL: You have cancer .
ADAM: I just think it 's an interesting time to take up smoking again .
RACHEL: Adam I 'm 24 years old !
CATCHES HERSELF: You 're 25 .
ADAM: Sshhhh . Everything 's going to be alright Yammy . I 'm going to start chemo in a few days .
POSITIVE: We 're going to get through this .
RACHEL: Do they know ?
ADAM: No .
BIG SMILE: Hey .
EDITH: There they are !
ADAM: Where 's dad ?
ART: I found your cat playing in the neighbors yard .
ADAM: Dad , I do n't have a cat . Art drops the cat and it bolts out the door .
EDITH: So what 's for dinner ?
RACHEL: If I had known you were coming I would have made something else .
EDITH: I 'm just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son So this is n't meat ?
RACHEL: No it 's called sei-tan .
ADAM: It 's made of wheat gluten . Edith looks more confused .
EDITH: But it 's not meat .
RACHEL: No , but it has a texture just like meat .
EDITH: Mmmmm . It 's Good .
RACHEL: A date ?
EDITH: Do not do summer like your cousin , emember how awful that was ? Schlepping around in the heat like that . Plus the bugs and the gnats .
ADAM: What is she talking about ?
EDITH: And now Rachel . I know we have n't discussed this , but are you going to convert ?
RACHEL: She thinks we 're getting married .
ADAM: Mom . We 're not getting married .
EDITH: Oh thank god .
TO RACHEL: No offense .
TO ADAM: So then what 's the big news that you made us rush all the way ove here .
ADAM: Have you ever seen `` Terms of Endearment '' ?
RACHEL: Oh jesus Adam , just tell her .
EDITH: Tell me what ?
ADAM: Alright fine . But , before I tell you , you have to promise me you 're going to stay calm .
EDITH: Oh Adam , do n't be so overdramatic .
ADAM: Mom , just promise me . Okay ?
EDITH: I promiseYou make me out to be some kind of irrational loon . Here goes nothing .
ADAM: I have cancer .

ADAM: Mom , I already have cancer .
EDITH: Here take these .
ADAM: Mom , please , stop . I do n't need these .
EDITH: Just take the god-damn pills . Adam take Edith 's hand .
ADAM: Mom .
EDITH: How could this happen ?
ADAM: It 's genetic .
EDITH: Genetic ? It must be from you father 's side of the family , they 're always getting sick . You uncle Bobby just got Crohns .
ART: That 's a disorder of the bowels , son . How are your bowels ?
ADAM: The problem is not with my bowels .
ART: You 're a lucky man .
ADAM: Thanks dad .
EDITH: I 'm moving in .
ADAM: What ? No . Absolutely not .
EDITH: Adam , I 'm your mother , and I need to be close to you in your time of need .
ADAM: That 's a terrible idea .
EDITH: Well who 's going to take care of you ?
ADAM: Mom , I 'm fine .
EDITH: I think I have a right to take care of my son with cancer .
ADAM: It 's nothing . Really .
EDITH: Nothing ! You tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me it 's nothing . Adam looks to Rachel for support .
RACHEL: Edith , I ca n't even imagine how hard this must be for you . But I promise , there 's nothing for you to worry about . I 'm going to be here every step of the way , to help take good care of your son .
EDITH: You 're a very lucky boy to be with such a good girl . You know that ? You do n't deserve her . Adam looks at Rachel and smiles .
ADAM: I know .
SETH: Look at how tight that shirt is . She 's totally aware of how large her breasts look too . This morning when she got dressed , she said to herself - `` I have these things and I want the world to see them . '' Greg looks up at the menu of endless options .
GREG: What about that frozen drink , what 's that like ?
BARISTA: The Bavarian Blender . It 's absolute heaven .
GREG: I do n't know . Does it have a lot of sugar ?
ADAM: We 've been here 20 minutes . What 's he shopping for a car ?
SETH: Why are you in such a rush ?
ADAM: Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life ? Wasting away in this place ?
SETH: Relax . We have plenty of time .
ADAM: No we do n't have plenty of time ! Life is finite .
SETH: What the fuck is wrong with you ?
ADAM: I have cancer .
SETH: Yeah right .
ADAM: I 'm serious .
SETH: Get the fuck out of here . You have cancer ? People in line look at Seth .
ADAM: Maybe a little louder , you can make a special announcement .
SETH: When did this happen ?
ADAM: Yesterday . They found a tumor in my spine .
SETH: Who ?
ADAM: What do you mean who ?
SETH: Who found the tumor ?
ADAM: Lewis and ClarkThe doctors found it .

KATIE: Can I help you ?
ADAM: I have an appointment with Dr. McRae .
KATIE: Please call me Katie .
ADAM: You 're Dr. McRae ?
KATIE: You were expecting someone else ?
ADAM: Are n't you supposed to be like sixty-five and wear earth toned sweaters ?
SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE: Why ? Did someone say that 's what I look like ?
ADAM: No , no , no . I was just expecting someone older .
KATIE: Sorry to disappoint you .
ADAM: No believe me , you 're fine . Bette than fine , you 're Dr. McRaeyou 're a doctor ? How old are you ?
KATIE: Twenty-six .
ADAM: Twenty-six ? What are you like Doogie Howser ?
KATIE: Who ?
ADAM: Doogie Howser Off Katie 's blank look .
KATIE: Does he work here ?
ADAM: No . Nevermindbut are n't you young to be a doctor ?
KATIE: I 'm actually in my final semeste of medical school . This is a training hospital .
ADAM: So have you had many patients ?
KATIE: You 're actually my first . That did not help to ease Adam 's anxiety .
ADAM: Oh .
KATIE: Please sit .
ADAM: Honestly . I feel fine .
KATIE: I think that 's great considering what you 're going through .
ADAM: Yeah , but I tend to internalize everything so , who knows .
KATIE: You mean you repress as a coping mechanism .
ADAM: Is that what I do ?
KATIE: That 's what you just said .
ADAM: The way I say it sounds cute in a neurotic way . When you say it , it 's like an indictment . The word `` repress '' - sounds so harsh .
KATIE: It 's actually quite common .
ADAM: Oh good , I 'd hate to think I 'm anything but an emotional sheep .
KATIE: Do n't think of it in those terms . It 's not like it 's been a conscious decision on your part . What 's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat you emotions and for me to help you make adjustments .
ADAM: So how do we do that ?
KATIE: The first thing I want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a urden . Cancer has come into you life to show you that you emotional and physical bodies are out of balance . This is your chance to correct that .
ADAM: You 're not in a cult are you ?
KATIE: Now , why do you say that ?
ADAM: I do n't know , it was a bad joke .
KATIE: But there 's a reason . You chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel . Katie is losing Adam .
ADAM: Huh ?
KATIE: I want you to lay back and close your eyes . Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch .
ADAM: Lay here ?
KATIE: Yes , I want you to just lay back , and let go .
ADAM: Should n't we be analyzing my childhood ? Or my days as a call girl ?
KATIE: Another joke ?
ADAM: Oh come on . Nothing ? That was funny .
KATIE: Ssshhhhh
ADAM: I ca n't believe you got me a present .
BEAT: Is it that Prada handbag I 've been eyeing ?
ADAM: What is it ?
RACHEL: Okay . Open your eyes .
ADAM: What is it ?
RACHEL: It 's Noodle .
ADAM: It 's so small . What do you do with it ?
RACHEL: Adam , IT 's a he , and HE 's adorableHaving a dog is supposed to help with the healing process .
ADAM: Why , did it go to medical school ?
RACHEL: I thought you 'd be happy
ADAM: It looks like a gremlin . What happens if you get it wet afte midnight ? Rachel looks furious . Adam backtracks .
REASONING: They 're a lot of work .
MORE: 40 .
RACHEL: I did n't realize it would be such a ig deal .
PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE: I can bring him back to the shelte in the morning .
ADAM: I know what you 're doing .
RACHEL: No , you 're right , it 's not a good idea . Tomorrow I 'll take him back where he 'll be kept in a tiny cage with 10 other dogs who will bully him , and rape him , and then he 'll eventually be euthanized .
ADAM: Alright . Fine , we can keep the dog .
RACHEL: Really ?
ADAM: Really . Rachel 's face lights up . She hugs Adam .
RACHEL: This is going to be so good fo you .

MITCH: Alan , stop it .
TO ADAM: Do n't listen to him , he 's just messing with you .

ADAM: What I need is for people to stop telling me what I need .
KATIE: Have you considered that this cancer is nature 's way of telling you to change the way you live you life ? There 's an old saying - you ca n't change the wind , but you can adjust the sails .
ADAM: They teach you that in medical school ? Katie 's patience is waning .
KATIE: I know you do n't like to talk about your feelings , but you have to learn to find an outlet .
ADAM: An outlet for what ? I have cancer .
KATIE: And how is your body ever going to fight the stress of that cancer if you ca n't even handle your own emotions ? Adam snaps , rasing his voice .

MORE: 75 .
KATIE: Perhaps you 'd prefer something a little more simple . Maybe a nice game of Connect Four or Bingo .
ADAM: She has a sense of humor .
BEAT: Until he had his stroke .
KATIE: That must have been hard , seeing him lose his cognitive skills like that .
ADAM: Well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a bette player , he just lost interest . Katie feels for Adam .
KATIE: You 've never talked about your dad .
ADAM: Well whose fault is that ? Doctor ?
KATIE: Hey !

OLD MAN: It 's worth it . End Dream .
RABBI: So you want to know what 's going to happen when you die ?
ADAM: I think it 's a fair question .
RABBI: Fair yes , but impossible for me to answer . Our deaths , like our lives , have meaning and are all part of God 's plan . How should I know what God has planned for you . Maybe if you came to service once in a while
ADAM: Well am I going to go to Heaven ?
RABBI: Probably .
ADAM: What if I want to just die ? That 's it . No Heaven .
RABBI: That 's like buying a ticket for a cruise and then not going . The Afterlife is where the fun begins .
ADAM: How can being stuck in some nonexistent void with my grandparents be fun . I spent my entire life trying to get away from my family , now I 'm going to have to spend an eternity with them .
RABBI: Adam , you can not look at death as a curse . Even in death we are all still part of God . Life on Earth is just the beginning .
ADAM: But that 's not what I want .
RABBI: Oy . Then find another religion . I do n't make the rules .
KATIE: You 're being awfully quiet today . Is everything okay ?
ADAM: I 'm going to die are n't I ?

ADAM: It 's true .
KATIE: We do n't know that . Adam sits up and looks at Katie .
ADAM: I 'm not getting any better .
KATIE: Do n't say that , you 're doing so well .
ADAM: Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away ? 7 billion light years ! It 's more than 3 billion years older than ou planet , and we 're just seeing it now ; and you think I 'm going to live ?
TOTALLY BAFFLED: What are you talking about ?
ADAM: Cancer is an epidemic ! It killed Alan , it 's going to kill me , and it 's going to kill millions more after me . There 's nothing anybody can do .
KATIE: This is really good Adam . Let it out .
ADAM: Will you stop !
BEAT: I ca n't do this anymore . It does n't matter . None of it . I 'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life . 100 years from now my legacy e will be that of just anothe person dead of cancer . That 's it .
KATIE: This helplessness you 're feeling is normal . These emotions you 're holding onto are what make you human . But it does n't mean you can just stop living your life .
BEAT: Look at how you 've grown over the past few months , you ca n't just throw it all awayTalk to me .
ADAM: I know you 're only trying to help , ut this is n't working for me anymore .

ADAM: Yeah .
PHIL: Are you sure that 's a good idea ? Phil is treading a fine line
ADAM: You said I look great .
PHIL: Yeah for a guy with cancer .
ADAM: Thank you Phil .
SYMPATHETICALLY: So you 're really okay ? I mean , the cancer , is-
ADAM: Oh it 's really good . We 've come to an understanding . It takes whateve it wants and depletes me of my every will to live , and I let it . Phil , second-guessing his decision-
PHIL: Welcome back .
SETH: And if you look over on your left you 'll see our newest exhibit `` The Last Days Pompeii . '' Buried in 79 AD y the catastrophic eruption of Mt .

TO ART: You happy ? You like shitting yourself ?
ADAM: Mom !
EDITH: He was the greatest thing to eve happen to me . And then I had you , and that was even greater . So if I hover and threaten you independence , so what ? You have a mother who loves you more than anything . Is that so awful ?
ADAM: No . It 's not .
DR. ROSS: Sorry to keep you folks waiting . It 's been one of those daysca got towed . Wife double parked it .
ADAM: So what do we do ?
DR. ROSS: We need to operate . If we do n't emove it soon we risk metastasis .
ADAM: But you said surgery was too risky .
DR. ROSS: We 're out of options .
EDITH: But he 's going to be okay , right ? You 're going to fix it .

ADAM: I ca n't believe this is all actually happening .
SETH: The girl or the cancer ?
ADAM: Both .
SETH: It 's some pretty fucked up shit .
ADAM: You know , I used to think that I was actually going to spend the est of my life with Rachelgranted that might not be so far off . What a waste . Seth puts his arm around him .
SETH: We need to get you laid .
ADAM: Do n't you ever give up ?
SETH: No .

PAUL: Did she say why ?
SUMMER: This thing . This whatever it is . You and me . Do you think this is normal ?
TOM: I do n't know . Who cares about normal ? ! I 'm happy . Are n't you happy ?
SUMMER: You 're happy ?
TOM: You 're not ?
SUMMER: All we do is argue !
TOM: That is such a lie !
RACHEL: Maybe she was just in a bad mood .
PAUL: A hormonal thing .
RACHEL: P.M.S . ?
TOM: What do you know about PMS ?
RACHEL: More than you .
TOM: Oh my god .
MCKENZIE: Please continue .
SUMMER: This ca n't be a total surprise . I mean , we 've been like Sid and Nancy for months .
TOM: Summer , Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife . We 've had some disagreements but I hardly think I 'm Sid Vicious .
SUMMER: No I 'm Sid .

PAUL: For real ?
TOM: For real , Paul . I 'm madly in love with that girl .
PAUL: Oh shit .
MCKENZIE: Now I know this may be a little isquebut if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative , right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark , maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach . The nuclea family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that .
VANCE: Hmmm . That 's an intriguing idea McKenzie . Along with Grossman 's `` Magellan Day '' I 'd say we 've got some potential here . What do you think Hansen ? Could you write up some prototypes for these ?
SUMMER: Excuse me , Mr. Vance ? There 's a call for you on line 3 .
VANCE: Everyone this is Summer , my new assistant . Summer just moved here from

MCKENZIE: Dude . I hear she 's a bitch from hell !
TOM: Really ?
MCKENZIE: Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room . She was totally not having it .
TOM: Maybe she was just in a hurry .
MCKENZIE: And maybe she 's some uppity , bette than everyone , superskank .
TOM: Damn .
MCKENZIE: I know . She 's pretty hot .
TOM: That makes me so mad ! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it ?
MCKENZIE: Dunno .
TOM: Like , just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin
MCKENZIE: and really good teeth .
TOM: And maybe the world 's most perfect eastsJust cause of that stuff , she can walk around like she 's center of the universe ?
MCKENZIE: Women .
TOM: Ugh . You know what ? Screw her ! We have n't even met and I ca n't stand her already .

TOM: Eh , you know . Same old story . Moved to the city to work for a company . Company went under . Needed a job . My friend worked here . Got me this .
SUMMER: And are you any good ?
TOM: Well I wrote that one .
SUMMER: `` Today You 're a Man . Mazel Tov on your Bar Mitzvah . ''
TOM: It 's a big seller .
SUMMER: I meant , are you any good as an architect ?
TOM: Oh No . I doubt it .
SUMMER: Well , I 'd say you 're a perfectly adequate greeting card writer .
TOM: Why thank you . That 's what they called me in college . `` Perfectly adequate '' Hansen .
SUMMER: They used to call me `` Anal Girl . ''
TOM: Ok , well , I 'll see you around .

TOM: We 're so compatible it 's insane ! Seriously ! It does n't make sense ! She 's not like I thought at all . She 's amazing .
RACHEL: Oh boy .
TOM: What ?
RACHEL: You knowjust cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do does n't make her `` the one . ''
TOM: Of course it does .
SARAH: Pause and come eat .
TOM: Hey Martin .

NARRATOR: When one strongly believes in something , it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds .
BEAT: The evidence did not support him .

AMANDA: I know it 's sudden but
TOM: No , this ca n't be . Everything was going so great . I do n't understand .
AMANDA: Here .
TOM: What 's this ?
AMANDA: Because you 're , like , the biggest music nerd I 've ever met , I think this should really help explain where I 'm coming from .
TOM: Sure . It 's all you wanted to listen to for weeks .
AMANDA: Right . And I still like it , do n't get me wrong . It 's just When I hear it now , I do n't feel the samerush .
TOM: Ok
AMANDA: I press the skip button .

AMANDA: I 'd rather listen to something else .
TOM: But Amanda this is a great fucking song !
PAUL: What ?
TOM: Me and Summer .
MCKENZIE: Was it ever on ?
TOM: No . But it could have been . In a world where good things happen to me .
PAUL: Yeah well , that 's not really where we live .
TOM: No .
MCKENZIE: So what happened ?
TOM: You ready for this ?
SUMMER: Yeah ?
TOM: So how was your weekend ?
SUMMER: It was good .
TOM: You believe that shit ?
MCKENZIE: What shit ?
PAUL: I think I missed something .
TOM: `` It was good . '' She did n't say `` It was good . '' She said `` It was good . '' Emphasis on the good . She basically said `` I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym . '' Fucking whore . Screw her . It 's over .
MCKENZIE: What the hell is wrong with you ? !
PAUL: Dude , you got problems .
TOM: She 's not interested in me . There 's nothing I can do .
MCKENZIE: Based on '' it was good ? ''
TOM: And some other things .
PAUL: Like what , she said `` hey '' instead of `` hi '' cause that totally means she 's a lesbian .
TOM: I gave her all sorts of chances .
SUMMER: I 'm going to the supply room . Anyone need anything ?
MCKENZIE: No thanks .
TOM: I think you know what I need .
SUMMER: Oh ok , sure , no prob .
TOM: Do you want to go out with me ?

TOM: They wo n't let you back in there after last time .
MCKENZIE: I was n't that bad .
TOM: Not at all . You just threw up on the stage , tried to fight the artender , and then threatened to urn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk . Quiet night for you .
MCKENZIE: You saved my life that day .
TOM: We are not going back there .
MCKENZIE: This is a work thing , Tommy . It wo n't be like that . The whole office is going .
TOM: I really ca n't . Even if I wanted to . There 's a lot of stuff I got ta take care of .

MCKENZIE: So you got a boyfriend ?
SUMMER: Me ? No .
MCKENZIE: Why not ?
SUMMER: Do n't really want one .
MCKENZIE: Come on . I do n't believe that .
SUMMER: You do n't believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent ?

MCKENZIE: I have no idea what you 're talking about .
SUMMER: It sounds selfish , I know , but I just like being on my own . Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt . Who needs all that ? We 're young . We 're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
TOM: Butwhat if you meet someone and fall in love ?
SUMMER: Love ? You seriously believe in that stuff ?

SUMMER: Interesting . A real romantic .
MCKENZIE: Oh you have no idea . This one embarrassing . There was this one girl , I got ta tell this story
TOM: Summer , hold on you do n't elieve in love ?
SUMMER: I do n't even know what that word means . I know I 've never felt it , whatever it is in all those songs . And I know that today most marriages end in divorce . Like my parents .
TOM: Well mine too but
SUMMER: Oh yeah , And I read in Newsweek , there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in `` love '' with a ock . Is that the love you 're talking about ?
TOM: Well
SUMMER: Why , what 's your take on it ?
TOM: I think it'skind of a huge thing .
SUMMER: Ok. Looks like we 're gon na have to agree to disagree on that one .
MCKENZIE: So , uh , who 's singing next ?
SUMMER: I 'd say it 's your turn loverboy .
TOM: Nooo . I do n't sing in public .
SUMMER: Sure you do . I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in .
TOM: I do n't
MCKENZIE: You really do .
SUMMER: It 's ok . I like it . Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous .
MCKENZIE: Self-confidence ! Ha !
TOM: Anyway , I 'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people .
SUMMER: Ok then . Let 's drink .
TOM: It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing .
SUMMER: Bartender !
TOM: That 's not it .
SUMMER: What is that then ?
TOM: I have no idea .
SUMMER: I used to watch it every week .
TOM: Me too . Why ca n't we think of the stupid A-Team theme song .

PAUL: Summer , wow what an unusual name . I 'm sure I 'd remember that if I had heard it before . Tom , how come you 've never mentioned you knew such a lovely little lady ?

TOM: Huh ?
SUMMER: I mean , who are you ? They 're happy . Just mind your own business .
TOM: 9 , 9.5 ?
SUMMER: Too soon to say . It 's all in the dismount .
TOM: If we 're lucky , there wo n't be a dismount .

TOM: Oh sweet Jesus !
BUS DRIVER: Son , you 're gon na have to exit the vehicle .
TOM: It 's very complex .
SUMMER: Complex . Yes .
TOM: I feel the same way .
SUMMER: God yes !
TOM: A lot of people have problems with this , but to me , it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that .
SUMMER: Why ?
TOM: Over there , that 's St. Patrick 's church . The beauty of St. Patrick 's is its humility . With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away , it 's too humble . No one even knows it 's there .
SUMMER: How would you change it ?
TOM: There 's a million things . First , there 's no need for this much glass . You could easily
SUMMER: Show me .
TOM: What ?
SUMMER: Do n't talk about it . Do it .
TOM: See this beam , it steps on the landscape . But if we moved it just so
SUMMER: You wan na
TOM: No you go first .
SUMMER: It does n't matter to me .

SUMMER: Why ?
TOM: Cause nobody loves Ringo .
SUMMER: That 's what I love about him .
BEAT: Ooh .
SUMMER: This got great reviews .
PAUL: So what 's going on with you and Summer ?
TOM: I do n't know .
PAUL: Is she your girlfriend ?
TOM: I would n't say that .
MCKENZIE: What would you say ?
TOM: Like , are we `` going steady ? '' Come on , guys . We 're adults .
PAUL: It 's not an unreasonable question . Watch . McKenzie , do you have a girlfriend ?
MCKENZIE: No I do not . In fact girls are epulsed by me . Paul , how about you ?
PAUL: Why yes , in fact I do . Her name is Robyn . See Tom , it 's easy .
TOM: It is when you 've been with the same girl since high school .
PAUL: You 've been `` seeing '' this girl , what , two months now ?
TOM: Something like that .
PAUL: And you have n't discussed it ?
TOM: No ! She 's not We 're not like that .
PAUL: Like what ?
MCKENZIE: Normal .
TOM: We 've just been hanging out .
PAUL: Hanging out ? !
TOM: Yeah . Guys , look , Summer and Iwe know how we feel . We do n't need to label it . `` Boyfriend , girlfriend . '' That stuff is very juvenile .
MCKENZIE: You 're so gay .
PAUL: Well let me ask you this then . Do you want her to be your girlfriend ?
TOM: I do n't know Maybe .
MCKENZIE: I heard her Hansen . She 's not the girlfriend type . You 're gon na need to discuss it .
TOM: No . We 're adults . It 'll be fine .
MCKENZIE: Have you made her a CD yet ?
TOM: Maybe .
MCKENZIE: Oh dude .
PAUL: You really need to have that talk .
RACHEL: You were saying ?
TOM: My thinking is why rock the oat ? Things are going well . If we start putting labels on it , that 's like the kiss of death . Like saying to a girl `` I love you . ''
RACHEL: I know what you mean . That 's what happened with me and Sean .
TOM: Who the hell 's Sean ?
RACHEL: My boyfriend before Mark .
TOM: Who the f ! Never mind . Help me . I need solid female advice .
RACHEL: I 'm 12 .
TOM: Yeah but , you know me . This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble .
RACHEL: Hmm . So , basically you do want to ask the question , ` are we oyfriend/girlfriend ? ' You 're just afraid you 'll get an answer you do n't want and that will shatte your illusions of how good everything 's been these past few months . Is that about right ?
TOM: Something like that .
RACHEL: Thomas , tell me this . Is it worse to get the wrong answer now o find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway ?
TOM: Who 's Lars ?
RACHEL: He 's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt 's face and Jesus 's abs .
TOM: That son of a bitch .
RACHEL: You see what I mean ?
TOM: Coach , no , wait ! I need her . Rachel , what do you think I should do ?
RACHEL: Just do n't be a pussy .
SUMMER: Hi .
TOM: Hi .
SUMMER: Are you ok ?
TOM: Yeah .
SUMMER: You sure ?
TOM: Summer , I 've got ta ask you something .
SUMMER: Ok .
TOM: I just do n't get women 's fashion nowadays . Everybody with the tattoos , the giant hoop earrings , those annoying hats . Explain this to me .
SUMMER: People think it looks good .
TOM: Do you ?

SUMMER: Sorry , no thank you .
DOUCHE: You 're serious ? This guy ?
TOM: Hey buddy
SUMMER: Do n't be rude . I 'm flattered , I 'm just not interested . Now why do n't you go back over there and leave us alone , ok ?
DOUCHE: It 's a free country .
TOM: Did you see that punch ? I do n't know where it came from . I have n't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade . Guess I 'm gon na have to throw out this shirt .
SUMMER: I ca n't believe you .
TOM: What ?
SUMMER: You were so completely uncool in there .
TOM: You 're mad at me ? I just got my ass kicked for you .
SUMMER: Oh that was for me ? You were , what , protecting me ? Next time Tommy , do n't . I fight my own battles .
TOM: Come on , that guy was an asshole !
SUMMER: You did n't have to hit him . Why did n't you just let me handle it ?
TOM: I do n't know . He was
SUMMER: See . This is why I do n't want a serious relationship .
TOM: Whoa . What was that ?
SUMMER: Nothing . Look , I like you Tom . I like this . What we 've been doing . But maybe it 's gone too
TOM: What ?
SUMMER: I told you all along what I do n't want and it 's

TOM: Summer we do n't have to label what we 're doing . I just I need -

SUMMER: Well yeah .

TOM: Come on , I 'm interested .
SUMMER: You wan na have the relationship history conversation ?
TOM: Yes .
SUMMER: You sure about that ?
TOM: No . Yeah . I do n't know . Why not ? I can take it .
SUMMER: Ok. Well , in high school , there was Markus .
TOM: Quarterback slash homecoming king ?
SUMMER: He was a rower . Very hot .
TOM: What happened to Markus ?
SUMMER: He works for the Republican party . Very successful . Just not for me .
TOM: Ok. And then ?
SUMMER: Well , for a short time in college , there was Kurt .
BEAT: And my semester in Rome . Daniele Belardelli . AKA `` The Puma . ''
TOM: The Puma ?
SUMMER: Yeah , cause , you know
TOM: And that 's it ?

ALISON: So how long have you known Paul and Robyn ?
TOM: Since grade school .
ALISON: No way , really ? That 's crazy .
TOM: Yeah .
ALISON: Well I 'm glad you called . They spoke very highly of you .
TOM: Great .
ALISON: Souh how 's it going ?
TOM: Ok .
ALISON: You 've been pretty quiet .
TOM: Sorry .
ALISON: I 'm pretty quiet too . Usually . It 's nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything , you know ?
TOM: Uh-huh .
ALISON: Do you want to try some
TOM: No thanks .
ALISON: Oh .
TOM: I 'm not usually like this . I was n't efore Long story short , she wrecked me . I do n't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and I 'm still kinda thinking about her .
ALISON: Well maybe you should think about someone else who could cheer you up .
TOM: I ca n't get her out of my head , you know ? I see her everywhere . She 's all I think about . And it 's horrible . Cause I totally did n't see it coming . I thought things were fine . So now I keep going through every day in my mind , every second really . Wondering . What went wrong ? Is it my fault ? Could I have prevented it somehow ?
SUMMER: While you continue to talk about uildings and whatever othe ullshit interests you , I 'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways I can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the abid vampire I am .
TOM: Maybe there were things I could have said or done , you know ?
ALISON: Waiter !
TOM: Or Christ , I do n't know , maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with .
SUMMER: It was good .
TOM: Anyway sorry . If I 'm acting strange , that 's why .
ALISON: It 's ok . I 'm sure it 's tough getting over an ex-girlfriend .
TOM: Actually she was never my girlfriend .
ALISON: You were in love , that 's what it does . But , now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill them .
TOM: Sure .
BEAT: Hey , I 've been talking non-stop . You talk .
ALISON: Me ? Well I grew up

TOM: Well You do n't want to just , maybe , go to dinner . I mean , you 've got ta eat right ?
SUMMER: I 'm not really that hungry . And this place is fancy right ?

BEAT: Hey , Happy birthday .
PAUL: I just got lucky I guess . We met in elementary school . We had the same class schedule in the 7th grade and we just clicked .
MCKENZIE: Love ? Shit , I do n't know . As long as she 's cute and she 's willing , ight ? Actually , cute is a strong word . Not atrocious .
RACHEL: That 's a pretty complex question . Philosophers , poets , scientists , everybody has a theory , do n't they ?
BEAT: Yes it is from one of our cards .
SUMMER: Ok I 'm sick of this love shit . Come on ! We 've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it 's now genetically encoded in ou very beings . And what does it mean ? Absolutely nothing . Give me a eak !
MCKENZIE: I 'm just saying I really need some ass . I 'm desperate .
BEAT: You got nothing ?
PAUL: I would n't say `` the girl of my dreams , '' no . The girl of my dreams would have a better rack . Probably different hair , could like sports a little more . But truth is Robyn 's better than the girl of my dreams .
BEAT: You know why ? Cause she 's real .
MCKENZIE: Hansen , do n't you have like twenty ar mitzvah cards to write ?
TOM: Nope . All done . What are you working on ?
MCKENZIE: Congratulations . But I 've run out of ways to say it . `` Good job , '' `` well done , '' `` way to go '' I got nothing .
TOM: Why do n't you try `` Everyday you make me proud . But today , you get a card . ''
MCKENZIE: Shit . That 's not bad .
TOM: No worries .
ALL: Whoa/Perfect/Yes !
TOM: What else you got ?
EMPLOYEE #1: Passover .
TOM: `` aint no woman got what you got , sista girl . Happy birthday to the lean , sheen , and sizzly mocha queen ! ''
BEAT: How 's that ?
TOM: Yeah . It 's pretty cool .
SUMMER: It sounds amazing .

TOM: What ? ! No way I never used that word .
SUMMER: They seemed to think I mean , why is your step-dad giving me a hug ?
TOM: He 's veryloving .
SUMMER: Does he hug all your friends ?
TOM: You 're having enough for both of us .
SUMMER: I 'm dancing . I have n't danced in ages . God . Come on .
TOM: No .
SUMMER: Come on ! I wan na dance with you .
TOM: Where were you an hour ago ? I might have danced then . I 've been standing here by myself this whole time and you did n't look over once .

SUMMER: Then why are you here ?
TOM: This is what you wanted to do sowe 're doing it .
SUMMER: Yeah well , I did n't need a chaperone . Go home . You 're a uzzkill standing there pouting .

VANCE: For example , here 's something you wrote last week ( reads from a card on his
DESK: `` Roses are Red , Violets are Blue . Fuck You Whore . '' Nowmost shoppers on Valentine 's Day -
TOM: Mr. Vance are you firing me ?
VANCE: No , no , no . Relax Hansen . You 're one of our most adequate writers .
TOM: Ok. Well , I 'm sorry . Things for me have been a little difficult .

PAUL: You 've been much much better .
MCKENZIE: So maybe it 's best we do n't eve ing her up again .
PAUL: Just let sleeping dogs lie .
MCKENZIE: Leave those dogs alone Tom !
TOM: You guys , look , I 'm I appreciate what you 're saying and , thank you , eally , for putting up with me these past few months . I 've been crazy . But I 've accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things . I wanted to get serious . Shit , I loved her . And I know now , she just is n't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy . The way I wanted . And she probably neve will . There was nothing I could do .
MCKENZIE: Tom .
TOM: It ca n't be . It 's impossible !
PAUL: It is .
TOM: How do you know ?
MCKENZIE: Tom !
TOM: What ? Oh yeah . Great .

TOM: This here is , and Rhoda , you know I mean no disrespect but this this is total shit .
MCKENZIE: Tom !
TOM: `` Do n't give up ? '' `` You can do it ? ''
VANCE: Hansen , this is a place of usiness . We do n't cut down our co- workers
TOM: That 's cause we 're liars ! It 's what we do here . Why do n't we level with people ? Stop feeding them nonsense ?
TABLE: `` I 'm sorry to hear your grandmothe has passed . '' What the hell ? Let 's give em some truth . Something like , `` Sorry to hear about you grandmother . Here 's a card so I get some credit in your time of need . I 'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma 's dead . ''
TOM: Think about it . `` Congratulations on your new baby . '' Eh How bout `` Congratulations on your new baby Guess that 's it for hanging out . Nice knowing ya , uddy . ''
VANCE: Hansen , sit down !

MCKENZIE: Tom

MCKENZIE: Tom !
TOM: It 's these greeting cards , Sir , these cards , these movies , these pop songs . They 're responsible fo all the lies , the heartache , everything ! We 're responsible ! Everyone shifts in their seats .
BEAT: Yeah I made it up , so what ? !
TOM: It 's all crap . We make and peddle crap . And sometimes people believe in this crap . I just ca n't do it anymore , Mr. Vance . There 's enough ullshit in the world without my help . I quit .

TOM: This is funny to you ?
SUMMER: What would have happened if I went to the movies instead ? If I went somewhere else for lunch ? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later ? Tom , it was meant to be , just like you said .

WELLES: You know , Amy , I 've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy I mean , is this what I get first thing ? Before you even `` hello , '' you accuse me ?
AMY: I 'm not accusing you
WELLES: Well , I 'm not smoking , okay ?
AMY: Okay , I believe you .
WELLES: We 've been all through that . I 've een on my best behavior .
AMY: How 's the detective business ?
WELLES: Business was fine . I 'll tell you what , you could n't pay me enough to live down there .
AMY: You better not be smoking , that 's all I can say .
WELLES: Honey , I 'm not , please Amy takes Welles hand , smiling at him .
AMY: I love you .
WELLES: I love you .
POLITICIAN: None too discreet , is he ?
WELLES: No , sir , he is not .
POLITICIAN: He 's an imbecile . I tried to warn my daughter , but what can you do ?
WELLES: The um you 'll find my invoice in the envelope . If that 's all
POLITICIAN: Yes , Mister Welles , thank you .
WELLES: Certainly , Senator . If I can eve e of further assistance . Welles leaves , glances back , shuts the door .
AMY: You think you 'll have time for the water heater this weekend ?
WELLES: Sure . I 'll call the guy .
AMY: You 're not using the same guy who tried to fix it ?
WELLES: I 'm not using him again fo anything . He was worthless . You have bridge here Saturday ?
AMY: Betty 's out of town so we 're playing next week .
WELLES: Hello . Yes could you hold on a minute ?
MRS CHRISTIAN: Mister Welles . You 're very prompt .
WELLES: I try to be .
MRS CHRISTIAN: I appreciate your coming on such short notice .
WELLES: Uh huh , pleasure .
MRS CHRISTIAN: Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak .
LONGDALE: Yes , I do have something to say . I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you .
WELLES: I 'm listening .
LONGDALE: As Mr. Christian 's attorney and one of the executors of his estate , it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my eing asked to attend .
WELLES: Of what sort ?
LONGDALE: You are a private investigator ?
WELLES: That 's right .
LONGDALE: Well , whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator , I should certainly be a party to . But , since she feels differently , I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval .
MRS CHRISTIAN: Yes , how theatrical . So you 've gone on the record , and now perhaps you should just be gone .
WELLES: Thank you .
MRS CHRISTIAN: He 's a lawyer . Please , sit , here
WELLES: I 've been privileged to provide services for people I admire .
MRS CHRISTIAN: You are highly recommended . Praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality . Welles nods , sipping tea .
WELLES: My condolences .
MRS CHRISTIAN: His passing has left me with something of a dilemma . A terrible , terrible dilemma .
WELLES: I 'll do whatever I can to help . Mrs. Christian studies Welles .
MRS CHRISTIAN: His inner sanctum .
WELLES: Pittsburgh ?
MRS CHRISTIAN: Mostly . That 's where he started his empire building . He was a good man . Notorious as an eccentric , but that was something he cultivated . He wanted to be legendary .
WELLES: He succeeded .
MRS CHRISTIAN: We were married forty-five years . Hard even for me to imagine . We had our troubles . There were plenty of places for him to be other than here , but he was always loyal to me , and I to him . I loved him deeply . Welles waits .
WELLES: I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to . Other than that , there 's never any reason .
MRS CHRISTIAN: Just curious .
WELLES: You hired someone to open it . I 'll et the lawyer loved that .
MRS CHRISTIAN: There was nothing he could do . My husband left everything to me . I prevented anyone from seeing the contents . I felt these were my husband 's private things . I did n't I did n't realize
WELLES: Do you want to tell me what you found ?
MRS CHRISTIAN: Cash , stock certificates , and this
WELLES: I 'm afraid I do n't
MRS CHRISTIAN: This is a movie showing a girl being murdered . She 's sitting on a bed , and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife I only watched what I could . Welles picks up the film , looks at it .
WELLES: Mrs. Christian please , will you sit down a moment ? I want you to listen carefully . What you 're talking about is a `` snuff film . '' But , from what I know , snuff films are a kind of urban myth . Like , red light district folklore . There 's no such thing , I can assure you . Mrs. Christian shakes her head .
MRS CHRISTIAN: No .
WELLES: If you were to study it you 'd see the camera cutting away you 'd see the tricks they can play
MRS CHRISTIAN: I 'm telling you it 's not that .
WELLES: I 'm sure it is . It 's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke . More than likely he never even watched it .
MRS CHRISTIAN: Will you watch it and see fo yourself ?
WELLES: Of course . But , I 'm certain it 's nothing to worry about .
MRS CHRISTIAN: I told you I ca n't , not yet .
WELLES: You do n't have any other choice .
MRS CHRISTIAN: No . For me to live with the ruin of my husband 's name , I need know that whoever did this will be punished . If you can find them , I will take their names to the police . I 'll say my husband confessed on his death ed . I 'll say I did n't have courage to come forward at first
WELLES: It wo n't work like that .
MRS CHRISTIAN: Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later , anonymously . I 've thought about it and there 's no other way . If you ca n't find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be emembered for , well I ca n't let that happen . I 'm telling you I wo n't . If there 's no chance that poor girl 's memory can be served , then I 'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her . Welles sits , rests his head in his hands .
WELLES: I deal in divorce cases . Corporate investigations
MRS CHRISTIAN: You 've found missing persons before .
WELLES: Nothing remotely like this .
MRS CHRISTIAN: I know what I 'm asking . You compensation will be appropriate to the risk . You 'll need cash to buy information , and I 'll provide it . I feel responsible , Mr. Welles . You saw what he did to her .
WELLES: This is the mortgage . This is Cindy 's college money .
AMY: I understand .
WELLES: Sometimes you ca n't know what I 'm doing . It 's better that way .
AMY: I know .
WELLES: It 's a missing persons case a long shot . I 'll give it two months , two months at most , then I 'll be ack . We 'll take a vacation .
AMY: Why the gun ?
WELLES: I 'm not gon na need it . I wo n't even wear it . It 's a precaution . Do n't worry about me .
DIRECTOR: What can I do for you , Mr. Welles ?
WELLES: Call me Tom .
DIRECTOR: Alright , Tom .
WELLES: What I 'd like , very simply , is access to your archive . And , now I understand this is n't something you normally do for private citizens
DIRECTOR: There are reasons for the way we do things here .
WELLES: Absolutely . Of course I 'll abide by whatever decision you make , but I 'd appreciate if you 'll hear me out The director sits back in his chair .
DIRECTOR: Why not go to the N.C.I.C . o
WELLES: I figured you share information .
DIRECTOR: We do .
WELLES: For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive .
DIRECTOR: Why do n't they come to me ?
WELLES: This doctor and wife , they 're nice people , but they do n't want to get too involved . They 're not trying to have the parents come looking fo the girl either . You and I both know sometimes , not often , but sometimes there 's real easons why a kid 'll run . Molestation , whatever . Besides that , the girl 's probably eighteen , so she 's legal .
DIRECTOR: I 'm not so sure about this .
WELLES: They 're putting themselves in place of this kid 's parents and thinking they 'd want to hear their girl 's okay , even if that 's all they hear .
DIRECTOR: I can give you my card , if you clients want to call me Welles accepts a CARD , disappointed .
WELLES: They were pretty clear they did n't want this coming back on them .
DIRECTOR: Well , that 's all I can do . Sorry .
WELLES: Who knows maybe she 's already given her parents a call , right ? Welles leaves .
DIRECTOR: Excuse me Tom , hold on
WELLES: Any good ?
DIRECTOR: It 's horrible , but it 'll be you est friend after a few days . I hope you realize what kind of long shot you 're chasing after .
WELLES: You 're gon na be seeing a lot of me . You 're sure you do n't mind ?
DIRECTOR: It 's good what you 're doing .
WELLES: Hello , Mrs. Christian ? Tom Welles . Here 's where we stand . I checked the film stock and it 's called Supra- lux 544 . The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92 Yeah , about five or six years ago . Anyway , do what you can to dig up your husband 's old financial ecords , look for anything out of the ordinary
MRS MATHEWS: Yes ?
WELLES: Hello , Mrs. Mathews , my name 's Thomas Jones , I 'm a state licensed investigator
MRS MATHEWS: I do n't understand , who are ?
WELLES: I 'm sorry , let me explain , the R.C.M.P . is a support organization and archive , not unlike the Cente for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington . I 'm sure you 've dealt with them before ?
MRS MATHEWS: Yes , but
WELLES: These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected , functioning hand in hand with law enforcement . The R.C.M.P . brought me in to review their investigations fact-check their records , see if there 's anything they missed , anything they should be doing different . I 'm here for a few days , efore I head back up to Virginia . These reports go to the Justice Department eventually . I spoke to your F.B.I . contact a few days ago , uh
MRS MATHEWS: Neil Neil Cole .
WELLES: Right , Agent Cole told me he 'd call and let you know to expect me . He did n't call ?
MRS MATHEWS: No .
WELLES: Well , I 'm following up on you daughter , Mary , height ; five four , weight ; hundred ten pounds , brown eyes , blonde hair . Born April 24 , 1976 . Missing June 11th , 1992 . A unaway , that 's how she 's listed . Is this information correct ? Mrs. Mathews stares , nods .
MRS MATHEWS: They hired you . You 're like , a private detective ?
WELLES: That 's exactly what I am .
MRS MATHEWS: I did n't think there were private detectives anymore , except on TV .
WELLES: You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat . Drinking whiskey , chasing women and getting eaten up by guys with broken noses . Want to know what it 's really like ? It 's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight , pissing in a plastic ottle , pardon me , because some guy thinks his wife 's cheating on him . Glamorous , huh ? And the guy who hired you , he has a hair-lip , dandruff and crooked teeth , and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife 's cheating , and you do n't blame her . Mrs. Mathews smiles .
MRS MATHEWS: No .
WELLES: She just seemed depressed ?
MRS MATHEWS: She did n't seem herself . For months there never was any way to get he to talk about it . One night we went to bed the next morning she was gone . She took some clothes .
WELLES: What was she running from ?
MRS MATHEWS: I do n't know .
WELLES: If there 's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about , tell me , but I have to ask . You husband he committed suicide ?
MRS MATHEWS: Yes .
WELLES: September 4th , 1993 . About a yea after Mary disappeared .
MRS MATHEWS: We were divorced by then . Things fell apart he was living with a friend
WELLES: Why do you think he did it ?
MRS MATHEWS: It got to be too much for him .
WELLES: You have to forgive me , but in these circumstances with you daughter Were there any indications of any sort of abuse ?
MRS MATHEWS: There was n't anything like that . The police and the FBI people asked , ut there was n't anything happened like that , never . My husband his heart broke when Mary left
WELLES: I did n't mean to
MRS MATHEWS: You try going through what we did . Bob could n't take it , that 's all . Christ , there 's times when it still seems like I ca n't either .
WELLES: I had to ask . I apologize .
MRS MATHEWS: No one knows what it 's like . You ca n't even imagine how much it hurts .
WELLES: Of course .
MRS MATHEWS: This is her room . Welles looks around , uncomfortable .
WELLES: I I should n't take anymore of your time . Maybe we can finish tomorrow . I 'll call tomorrow
MRS MATHEWS: Okay .
WELLES: You should be able to take a showe and still have hot water left , honey . Call him back and tell him I said so . The goddamn thing 's still unde warranty . I 'm okay . It 's hard here . It 's hard . I 've got a lead I have to follow through . To be honest , I do n't think I 'm going to get very far . I miss you . I love you .
MRS MATHEWS: We were n't religious . We neve forced religion down her throat , like I 've seen some parents do to their kids . We never made her go to church . But , after Mary was gone , that 's when I got religious . Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee , sits .
WELLES: We 're all like that .
MRS MATHEWS: Are you religious ?
WELLES: No .
MRS MATHEWS: You should be .
WELLES: I 've got what I need for my report . There is there is one thing that others me though .
MRS MATHEWS: What ?
WELLES: It 's not really my place , but it 's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either . See , I know a little about missing persons . When kids run , they almost always leave a note . It 's guilt . They want to say goodbye .
MRS MATHEWS: There was n't one . The police looked .
WELLES: Do you think the police did a good job ?
MRS MATHEWS: I do n't know . I think so .
WELLES: It is possible and I know this is n't something you want to hear . Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it , but where she knew your husband would never find it . She might have wanted to tell you something
MRS MATHEWS: No . You do n't have any reason to think that
WELLES: If the police focused their search
MRS MATHEWS: How how can you say that to me ?
WELLES: Will you let me look ?
MRS MATHEWS: My husband never laid a hand on her . She would have told me she would have told me
WELLES: You 're probably right , and I probably wo n't find anything . I do n't have a right to ask this , and you can kick me out of you house if you want , but this is my profession and there 's a part of me that ca n't let it go . Police are just as human as you or I . They could have missed something . They probably did n't . Would n't you rather know ?
MRS MATHEWS: Go ahead and look if you want . I do n't care what you do .
WELLES: You were right . I did n't find anything . I 'm going to run and get something to eat . Are you hungry ?
MRS MATHEWS: Yes .
WELLES: Do you ever consider do you ealize that Mary may never come ack ?
MRS MATHEWS: I think about it everyday . But , every time the phone rings every single time , I still think it 's her .
WELLES: It 's been six years .
MRS MATHEWS: What am I supposed to do ? Forget her ? Time heals all wounds , right ? She 's all I think about , and I 've learned to live with that . But , you want the truth the real truth ? If I had a choice if I had to choose , between her being out there , living a good life and being happy , and me not knowing ; never finding out what happened to her or her being dead and me knowing I 'd choose to know . Mrs. Mathews stares into the TV , wipes tears .
WELLES: Excuse me , I have to use you athroom .
PIERCED CLERK: What are you looking for ?
WELLES: Nothing .
PIERCED CLERK: Fuck-head .
MAX: Big date tonight ?
WELLES: Yeah guess so .
MAX: Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina ?
WELLES: Pardon me ?
MAX: My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling .
WELLES: Well , it 's tempting , but no thanks .
MAX: It 's your call , but you 're gon na be sorry when you 're in one of those everyday situations that call for a attery-operated vagina and you do n't have one .
WELLES: I 'll risk it .
MAX: Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore . Have a nice day .
WELLES: What are you reading ? Max holds up the book , `` ANAL SECRETARY . ''
MAX: Once you pick it up you ca n't put it down .
WELLES: Catchy title . What are you really eading ? Hard to believe that book 's got any parts worth highlighting .
MAX: I tear off the cover and paste this one on You know how it is .
WELLES: Would n't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts .
MAX: Might get drummed out of the pornographer 's union , and then where would I be ?
WELLES: Hi , honey , how are you ? How 's Cindy ? The way it 's going I 'm about ready to pack my bags
MAX: Came back for that battery-operated vagina , right ? Told you you would .
WELLES: I need some information . Thought you might be able to help .
MAX: Thomas Welles . Nice picture .
WELLES: I 'll be outside having a cigarette .
MAX: Cover me , Beth . I 'm taking a break .
WELLES: Good for you .
MAX: Three , four years .
WELLES: What 's your name , if you do n't mind me asking ?
MAX: Max .
WELLES: Well , here 's the deal , Max . This thing I 'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography . Stuff that 's sold under the counter , illegally
MAX: There 's not much illegal .
WELLES: Well , whatever there is , whoever 's dealing , however it 's done , I want to know . I want a good look , so if you 've got that kind of connection , great . If not , speak now .
MAX: You 're not a cop , are you ? If I ask and you are , you have to tell me .
WELLES: I 'm not a cop .
MAX: You 're a private eye . Like Shaft .
WELLES: Not quite .
MAX: From Pennsylvania . P.I . from PA. What are you doing out here ?
WELLES: Well , there 's the thing ; you 're not gon na know anything about what I 'm doing , but you can make some money .
MAX: How much ?
WELLES: How much do you make now ?
MAX: Four hundred a week , off the books .
WELLES: Okay , let 's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump . I 'll give you six hundred for a few days .
MAX: Sounds good , pops .
WELLES: Here 's my number if you need it When can you start ?
MAX: Tomorrow night , I get off at eight .
WELLES: See you then . Oh , and , do n't call me `` pops . '' Welles walks away .
MAX: Come on .
GOON: Are you a law enforcement agent o in any way affiliated with law enforcement ?
MAX: Fuck you , Larry .
GOON: Are you a law enforcement ?
WELLES: No .
ONE DEALER: We 're shutting down in fifteen minutes . Fifteen minutes .
WELLES: What are these ?
ANGRY DEALER: Mixed hard bondage . Rape films . Sick shit . Buy five , get one free .
WELLES: Anything harder ?
ANGRY DEALER: There 's nothing harder .
WELLES: Snuff ?
ANGRY DEALER: What you see is what I got , mister .
WELLES: You know where I can get it ? I have a lot of money to spend .
ANGRY DEALER: There ai n't no such thing as snuff . Why do n't you fuck off ? The dealer sits and keeps counting cash .
LARGE MAN: You have to pay to come in here . Welles backs away , shuts the curtain .
MAX: You 've got Penthouse , Playboy , Hustler , etc . Nobody even considers them pornography anymore . Then , there 's mainstream hardcore . Triple X . The difference is penetration . That 's hardcore . That whole industry 's up in the valley . Writers , directors , porn stars . They 're celebrities , or they think they are . They pump out 150 videos a week . A week . They 've even got a porno Academy Awards . America loves pornography . Anybody tells you they never use pornography , they 're lying . Somebody 's buying those videos . Somebody 's out there spending 900 million dollars a yea on phone sex . Know what else ? It 's only gon na get worse . More and more you 'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream , because that 's evolution . Desensitization . Oh my God , Elvis Presley 's wiggling his hips , how offensive ! Nowadays , Mtv 's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out . Know what I mean ? Fo the porn-addict , big tits are n't big enough after a while . They have to e the biggest tits ever . Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head , literally . Soon , Playboy is gon na be Penthouse , Penthouse 'll be Hustler , Hustler 'll be hardcore , and hardcore films 'll be medical films . People 'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds . There 's nowhere else for it to go .
WELLES: Interesting theory .
MAX: What you saw tonight , we 're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend . We 're talking about stuff where people get hurt . Specialty product .
WELLES: Child pornography .
MAX: There 's two kinds of specialty product ; legal and illegal . Foot fetish , shit films , watersports , ondage , spanking , fisting , she- males , hemaphrodites it 's beyond hardcore , but legal . This is the kind of hardcore where one guy 's going to look at it and throw up , another guy looks at it and falls in love . Now , with some of the S+M and ondage films , they straddle the line . How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not ? Step over that line , you 're into kiddie porn . Rape films , but there are n't many . I 've never seen one .
WELLES: Snuff films .
MAX: I heard you asking . That guy was n't yanking you around . There 's no such thing .
WELLES: What other ways are there to get illegal films ? Who do you see ?
MAX: First of all , basement sales like tonight are n't gon na last much longer . It 's too risky , one , and two , everything 's going on the internet . Anyone with a compute and enough patience can find anything he wants . It 's heaven fo those degenerate chicken-hawks . They 're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em . But , there 's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes . No one knows where it comes from . That 's local underground , where information spreads by word of mouth . Those are zombies , hardcore junkies . Thei hands are permanently pruned . They go out in the sun they do n't burn , they blister . Other than that , all I know about is the mail . Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes . Secret couriers . Credit card orders to dummy corporations . Interstate wire transfers . Revolving P.O . boxes . But , if you 're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit who knows ? That 's the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible , and vice versa , and cops ca n't trace the deal . There 's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is . Welles watches Max eat .
WELLES: How old are you ?
MAX: Twenty-five .
WELLES: Where are your parents ?
MAX: I do n't know , where are yours ?
WELLES: I do n't mean any offense but what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
MAX: I 'm not mixed up in anything , hayseed . What are you talking about ?
WELLES: You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else .
MAX: Yeah , I 'm a real genius . What choices have I got ? Fuck , just ecause I know about stuff like tonight does n't mean I deal it . I work a job . It beats pumping gas , eats making hamburgers .
WELLES: You 're telling me it does n't get to you ?
MAX: You ca n't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb . So what ? Am I gon na go off and be a race ca driver ? Go to Harvard ? Run fo President ? What about you , pops ?
WELLES: What about me ?
MAX: I see a ring on your finger . You have any kids ?
WELLES: A daughter .
MAX: So , you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania what are u > you doing mixed up in all this ?
WELLES: Good question .
MRS CHRISTIAN: My husband had five cash accounts he used to temporarily hold stock profits . Between November of 1991 and March of 1992 , he wrote one check out to cash from each account . He wrote these himself
WELLES: Okay
MRS CHRISTIAN: One was for two hundred thousand , one dollar and thirteen cents . Another was for three hundred thousand , six hundred fifty fou dollars and seventy six cents
WELLES: You 're joking .
NUN: Yes I remember Mary
WELLES: You you do ? You 're sure ? Please , Sister , will you take another look , make sure
NUN: Yes . I remember her .
WELLES: I 'm trying to find out . She was a unaway . I 'm looking into it fo her parents .
NUN: Can you get that down for me ? Welles climbs the ladder , points at boxes
WELLES: What is this ?
NUN: Those are her belongings .
WELLES: Her belongings ?
NUN: That 's her suitcase . I had forgotten it , till you showed me her picture .
WELLES: Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time ?
NUN: She was the kindest , sweetest girl you 'd ever want to meet . Oh , I adored her . I supposed I always hoped she 'd be back . After a time , all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things . Can you get this suitcase to her parents , if you think it 's appropriate ?
WELLES: I 'll do what I can .
WELLES: Okay , I 'll take it all .
SALESPERSON: Excellent . we accept MasterCard and American Express .
WELLES: Cash .
SALESPERSON: Alright . May I have your phone number , area code first ?
WELLES: No , you may not .
SALESPERSON: Okay . Fine .
WELLES: Yeah , I know the spiel . If you could bag it , I 'll be on my way , thank you .
SALESPERSON: Certainly , sir .
WELLES: Come on , Eddie THROUGH BINOCULARS Eddie sits motionless .
MAX: Dino Velvet yeah , he 's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks , supposed to be a real weirdo .
WELLES: Alright , I get the picture .
MRS CHRISTIAN: Hello ?
WELLES: I 've made progress . I 'm in Manhattan . Once a few more pieces fall into place , I 'll drive to you and give you an update .
MRS CHRISTIAN: How will I get it to you ?
WELLES: If you have a pencil and paper , I 'll tell you how to send it .
MAX: You did n't say it was gon na be this luxurious .
WELLES: It 's their Presidential Suite .
MAX: Great . Max looks in the bathroom .
WELLES: It 's cheap , and people know to mind their own business . What have you got for me ?
MAX: Dino Velvet .
WELLES: Max wake up Max awakens , rolling over , groggy .
MAX: Wha ?
WELLES: Who is this , in the mask ? Who is he ? Max tries to see , eyes barely open .
MAX: He 's one of the lunatics Dino uses . He 's in a bunch of these .
WELLES: No it 's nothing that 's not him .
MAX: I told you , he 's one of Dino Velvet 's stock players
WELLES: Who is he , his name ?
MAX: Nobody knows his name . That 's his thing . He always wears a mask . You never see his face . He calls himself `` Machine , '' that 's what they call him . Machine .
WELLES: You do n't need to be here .
MAX: What kind of Junior P.I . would I be if I did n't go with you ?
THUG: You 're in the wrong place .
WELLES: We 're looking for Mr. Velvet .
THUG: He 's not here .
WELLES: Why do n't you tell him we 're here to give him a large sum of money . If he 's not interested , we 'll go .
THUG: You should leave now , before I have to remove you .
WELLES: You heard the boss , Milo .
DINO VELVET: Come in . Make yourself comfortable .
WELLES: It 's an honor to meet you . Thank you for seeing us .
DINO VELVET: What can I do for you today ?
WELLES: I 'd like to commission a work . I 'm a great admirer of yours .
DINO VELVET: Flattering . And , who 's you colorful little chum ?
WELLES: A fellow investor .
DINO VELVET: Hmm .
MAX: You 're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video . Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore the grain , the gritty look you get .
DINO VELVET: Well , I 'm glad you appreciate it . What would you say is your favorite piece ?
MAX: I know if I had to pick , it 'd be `` Choke , '' or `` Devil . ''
WELLES: `` Devil '' frightened me as much as it excited me , but I 'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite . Dino grins , showing yellowed teeth .
DINO VELVET: You said something about money .
WELLES: Yes . What we 're looking for is ather specific .
DINO VELVET: Is it ?
WELLES: Five thousand now , five thousand on delivery . Two women , one white and one black , as long as they have large breasts . Hard bondage , or course . Other than that , trusting your artistic interpretation , I have only two stipulations .
DINO VELVET: And they are ?
WELLES: I want to watch you work .
DINO VELVET: I 'll consider it .
WELLES: And the other performer it has to e that monster you use the man in the mask .
DINO VELVET: Machine .
WELLES: If it 's not him , there 's no deal .
DINO VELVET: He might be interested but it would mean another five thousand .
WELLES: We can do that .
DINO VELVET: Well , well , I 'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this . You 'll leave the money as a deposit ? Very good .
WELLES: I 'd rather you did n't .
DINO VELVET: What 's the problem ?
WELLES: I 'm camera shy .
DINO VELVET: You trust me to keep your money , but not to take your picture ?
WELLES: Those are two different kinds of trust . Thank you for your time . I hope we can do business .
DINO VELVET: I 'll do this for you . Fifteen thousand dollars .
WELLES: Where 's that ?
MAX: What 's next ?
WELLES: I 'm trying to figure that out myself . I have to see Machine without his mask .
MAX: Still do n't want to tell me what you 're doing ?
WELLES: Nope .
MAX: What 's this ?
WELLES: It 's money . People use it to purchase goods and services . Max looks at it again , ca n't believe it .
MAX: Look that 's awful generous and everything
WELLES: It 's not my money . The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought . Let 's not make a ig deal out of this , okay ? Go be a race car driver . Go run fo President . Whatever . Welles puts his cigarette out , stands .
DINO VELVET: There you are . Come join us .
WELLES: Hello .
DINO VELVET: You brought the money ?
WELLES: Right here .
DINO VELVET: Excellent .
WELLES: Where are the women ?
DINO VELVET: They should be here any minute .
WELLES: What are these for ?
DINO VELVET: Hmm ? Oh , the knifes ? They 're just props . Nice , are n't they ?
WELLES: Sure . Dino walks across towards the target .
DINO VELVET: Machine and I were just talking about knifes . The beauty of knifes Dino pulls arrows from the target .
WELLES: What are you ?
DINO VELVET: Take out your gun ! Welles brings his hand towards his holster
WELLES: Look , I do n't know what this
DINO VELVET: Shut up , cunt ! Do exactly as I say , or I 'll put this arrow through you throat .
EDDIE: Is that him ?
DINO VELVET: Put the gun down , take the handcuffs . Handcuff yourself to the ed . Welles obeys , walks to the bed .
EDDIE: This is the fucker ? Motherfucker , does n't look like anything
DINO VELVET: You remember Mr. Longdale , do n't you ?
WELLES: I remember him .
LONGDALE: Let 's get this over with .
DINO VELVET: Fine idea . Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles .
WELLES: No
DINO VELVET: Friend of yours ?
WELLES: Look , he 's got nothing to do with this let him go
DINO VELVET: Can you guess what I 'm going to say next ?
WELLES: He does n't know anything he 's got nothing to do with this
DINO VELVET: Bring the film , or we kill him .
WELLES: I 'll get it . It 's in a safe deposit ox , in the city
DINO VELVET: How cooperative . Longdale will keep you company .
EDDIE: Move it , dirtbag !
DINO VELVET: Do hurry .
WELLES: You were the middleman , am I right ? Old man Christian was n't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself .
LONGDALE: Would n't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature .
WELLES: So , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand-boy . And if you refused , it was n't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . That 's the eauty of lawyer/client privilege .
LONGDALE: That 's trust . Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly .
WELLES: Must have paid you a lot , for you to isk everything . Would 've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money .
LONGDALE: I was well compensated .
WELLES: That 's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me . You knew about the film , figured it had to be in that safe . How 'd you find me ?
LONGDALE: Never mind how I found you .
WELLES: Followed me must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on you uddies
LONGDALE: They 're no friends of mine .
WELLES: Except , you 're willing commit murde with them .
LONGDALE: None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone . If you were n't digging up a girl who died six years ago . A girl no one even remembers .
WELLES: Mary Anne Mathews , that was he name . Her mom remembers her . Welles looks at Longdale .
LONGDALE: Shut up .
WELLES: Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered .
LONGDALE: Shut your mouth and drive !
WELLES: Did it get him off , huh , watching them cut her up ? Tell me , because I really want to understand . Did he jerk off to it ? You watch it with him , sit there giving him a handjo while you both watched ? Longdale jams the gun against Welles ' side .
LONGDALE: You 're making me very angry .
WELLES: Just tell me . Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared . What kind of degenerate pervert was he really ? What the fuck did he want with a snuff film ?
LONGDALE: You 're asking me why ?
WELLES: I 'm asking .
LONGDALE: A man like Mr. Christian , a great man all his money , all his power a man who attained everything there was to attain
WELLES: Why did he buy a film of some poor , lost girl getting butchered ?
LONGDALE: Is n't it incredibly obvious ?
WELLES: Enlighten me .
LONGDALE: Because he could . He did it because he could . What other reason were you looking for ?
MANAGER: May I show you to a booth
WELLES: No , I 've got it .
LONGDALE: You almost went over your limit .
WELLES: Fuck you . Welles puts the car in gear and drives .
LONGDALE: Give me the film .
WELLES: You 'll get it when we get there .
LONGDALE: Give me the film .
WELLES: Go ahead , shoot me . Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield .
EDDIE: You 're a dead man .
DINO VELVET: Leave him alone .
EDDIE: Fuck off .
DINO: I promised him to Machine .
EDDIE: sorry
DINO VELVET: First things first . You might want to watch this , Mr. Welles Welles looks up through tears
WELLES: Do n't please
DINO VELVET: And so it ends . It 's as if she never existed .
WELLES: Motherfuckers . Small time , motherfuckers ! Tell me something
EDDIE: What 's he talking about ?
WELLES: One million dollars , Dino . How much did he tell you he had Longdale 's getting very nervous .
LONGDALE: He 's lying .
WELLES: Look at him . You think he played it square ? How much did he give you , how much did he keep for himself ? Eddie walks towards Longdale
EDDIE: What the fuck 's he talking about ?
LONGDALE: Stay away from me .
DINO VELVET: What 's going on , Longdale ? Did this happen ?
EDDIE: You sell us short , you fuck ?
LONGDALE: Stay back ! You have a gun , Eddie , show it to me . Now ! Eddie slowly takes out his gun , seething .
EDDIE: You fucking lawyer
LONGDALE: Move back ! All of you move !
DINO VELVET: What were you thinking ?
LONGDALE: Back off ! Everything 's been taken care of , and I 'm leaving now
DINO VELVET: You 're not going anywhere if you fucked us , lawyer .
LONGDALE: I 'm leaving .
EDDIE: You got the guts , tough guy ? Gon na kill us all , is that it ?
DINO VELVET: You betrayed us .
LONGDALE: Stay where you are !
DINO VELVET: You 're not gon na live through this .
LONGDALE: Our business is done , I 'm leaving , no one 's going to stop me
DINO VELVET: Fuck you ! Machine unsheathes the KNIFE and THROWS
EDDIE: Fuck .
MACHINE: He 's mine !
WELLES: No , no , no please , do n't kill me please !
EDDIE: Do him good .

AMY: Tom
WELLES: It has to be this way for now . It wo n't be long .
AMY: Why have n't you called ? Why do n't you answer your phone ?
WELLES: I do n't know . I 'm sorry
AMY: You 're sorry ? What was I supposed to think ? Amy comes to take Cindy from him .
WELLES: I wanted to call . I could n't .
AMY: You could n't ?
WELLES: You do n't understand
AMY: No , I do n't , because you 're not telling me anything !
WELLES: I was in hell . If I called you if I heard your voice it would have been so easy for me to quit . I could n't do that . Tears comes to Amy 's eyes .
AMY: You should have .
WELLES: Amy , I 'm not going to let anything happen to us .
AMY: Look where we are . Look at yourself . You son of a bitch , you do n't have any idea what you 're putting me through
WELLES: I do n't know what to say
AMY: You 're killing me
WELLES: Do n't
AMY: What was I supposed to think happened to you ? !
WELLES: Amy
AMY: Who are you calling ?
WELLES: Mrs. Christian .
AMY: What ?
WELLES: She 's all I 've got . She 's the only witness .
AMY: Tom she 's dead . Welles looks to Amy .
WELLES: I just talked to her .
AMY: How could you not know ?
WELLES: Promise you wo n't go back there , wherever you were . Whatever it was , forget it . Welles takes a deep breath , nods his head .
AMY: Promise me . Welles looks out into the night sky of stars .
WELLES: I promise .
EDDIE: I 'm gon na kill you .
WELLES: Do n't bore me with that bullshit .
EDDIE: How 'd you find me here ? Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the ear .
WELLES: Do n't ask questions .
EDDIE: Fuck you !
WELLES: Starting to recognize a pattern ?
EDDIE: What do you want ?
WELLES: Who is Machine ?
EDDIE: I do n't know
WELLES: I want his name .
EDDIE: I told you , I do n't know .
WELLES: I will never get tired of hurting you , Eddie , so you might want to change your attitude .
EDDIE: What the fuck am I gon na protect that freak for ? He was Dino 's boy , not mine . He shows up with his mask on , leaves with his mask on . Nobody knows .
WELLES: Okay , we 'll come back to that . So , six years ago a guy contacts you , through the classifieds , over the phone , however he does it . It 's Longdale , looking for a snuff film . And you , entrepreneur that you are , tell him you can hook him up .
EDDIE: Yeah , the fucking lawyer .
WELLES: Told him you could get him a snuff film .
EDDIE: Yeah .
WELLES: How much did he pay you ?
EDDIE: Thirty thousand each , that fucking cocksucker .
WELLES: That 's all ? Thirty each . That 's all it took for you to murder her ?
EDDIE: It was a lot of fucking money .
WELLES: So you brought Dino in , and he ought Machine . And , one day , a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper fo models . And she never walked out .
EDDIE: Something like that .
WELLES: What did you do , knock her out , shoot her up ?
EDDIE: What the fuck do you want from me ?
WELLES: I want to know . I want to know exactly what you did to her !
EDDIE: Fuck you then , you want to know ? I talked her up , told her how eautiful she was , told her she was gon na be a star . I told her I was gon na get her a screen test , and while I 'm doing that , I got her a soda and dropped a mickey . When it was dark enough , I rang Dino and told him it was go time , I put he in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it . That 's what happened . She 's dead . She 's been dead a long fucking time . Nobody fucking cares !
WELLES: Show me !
EDDIE: Why ?
WELLES: Because we 're going there .
EDDIE: What are we doing here ?

EDDIE: I do n't know . I felt like it . I never saw anyone get done before .
WELLES: You enjoy it ?
EDDIE: Made me sick , but what did I care ? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that . It was just something I was doing for money .
WELLES: Tell me what happened .
EDDIE: What do you want to know ? You saw it , you saw the loop
WELLES: Nobody saw you bring her in ?
EDDIE: There was n't nobody around . This place was a shit-hole . I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in , like groceries . Dino made her eat a bunch of pills , we laid out the plastic , put film in the camera and Machine went to work .
WELLES: What did you do with her body ?
EDDIE: Took it out the bathroom window . Buried it in the woods .
WELLES: Show me .

EDDIE: You ca n't go to the cops . All you can do is cut me loose and walk away , because you got nothing
WELLES: Stop talking .
EDDIE: You got absolute zero .
WELLES: Show me where you buried her .
EDDIE: I do n't know out there somewhere .
WELLES: Where ? Show me where .
EDDIE: I fucking do n't know . What do you think we were n't burying treasure . We did n't pace it out so we could come back and get it . We dug a hole and we put her in it . Your guess is as good as mine .
WELLES: I can kill you . I can leave you out here , just like you left her . Eddie 's not backing down .
EDDIE: Do it .
WELLES: Do n't think I wo n't .
EDDIE: Do it ! Put me out of my misery so I do n't have to listen to you whining anymore . You think it 's so easy ?
WELLES: Easy enough for you .
EDDIE: I never killed anyone .
WELLES: That 's right , you just stood there and watched , because you `` felt like it . '' Almost makes you worse .
EDDIE: What do you want ? You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby ?
WELLES: Mrs. Mathews ? It 's Thomas . Do you emember , I was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter
