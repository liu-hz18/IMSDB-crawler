STEVE: Jesus , where 's the cable guy already ?
STEVEN: Hello .
RICK: How 's the move going ?
STEVEN: Horrible . The cable guy is missing in action . Apparently he 's going to be here sometime between eight AM and my death .
RICK: You have n't called Robin have you ? Please tell me you did n't call her .
STEVEN: No , I 'm giving her space . I ca n't believe she 's doing this .
RICK: You never should have asked her to marry you . You 're the mad smotherer .
STEVEN: All she had to do was say no . She did n't have to kick me out . I feel like Felix Unger .
RICK: You forced her to evaluate the elationship . If you did n't propose she would never have realized how unhappy she was .
STEVE: I do n't want to talk about it . So what time are you going to come by ?
RICK: I ca n't . I 'm working double shifts the est of the week .
STEVEN: It 's my first night here . Do n't do this to me .
RICK: The other camera guy pulled out his back . Besides , I spent the last two weeks with you on my couch . Is n't that enough ?
STEVEN: Fine , fine .
RICK: One piece of advice . Slip the cable guy fifty bucks , he 'll give you all the movie channels for free . Even the dirty ones .
STEVEN: I could n't . I 'm not good at that stuff . What if he says no ? I 'll feel like an idiot .
RICK: None of them say no , believe me . I 'll talk to you later . Steven hangs up , and waits .
STEVEN: Where the hell is he ?
CABLE GUY: Well , look who decided to show up . I was just gon na go collect my retirement pension .
STEVEN: You were supposed to be here four hours ago .
CABLE GUY: Was I ? So I 'm the tardy one . Good to know .
STEVEN: Yes . I had to go to the Bed ' n Bath place , but now it 's closed .
STEVEN: What happened ?
CABLE GUY: They had a lot of cats . They walk into Steven 's living room .
STEVEN: These go to your boss ?
CABLE GUY: No , they go to me . I 'm a perfectioniss… perfectioniss… perfectioniss…t . Now let 's take a look at what we 're dealing with .
STEVEN: What ?
CABLE GUY: In preparing your service I noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut . Last week the illing was transferred to one Robin Harris . Smells like heartbreak to me .
STEVEN: I really do n't want to talk about it with you . Could you please just install my cable ? I 'm going to get dressed .
CABLE GUY: No sweat .
STEVEN: Okay , whatever . Steven walks toward his bedroom .
CABLE GUY: Put on your bathing suit 'cause you 'll be channel surfing in no time .
RIKKI KLIEMAN: So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother , Stan , in cold blood . The twins were stars of the hit sitcom `` Double Trouble '' which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four .
STEVEN: How 's it going ?
CABLE GUY: Guilty , guilty , guilt-freakin-tee . I hope they fry this bastard .
STEVEN: What happened ?
CABLE GUY: The arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception . I moved a few things . Cleared it right up . Is that cool ?
STEVEN: I… guess so .
CABLE GUY: You programmed ? Then let me slave your remotes .
STEVEN: So after this I 'll only need one remote for everything ?
CABLE GUY: You know you 're pretty good at this . You could be a cable guy yourself . Now let me check your levels .
STEVEN: One thing .
CABLE GUY: Yeah !
STEVEN: I… uh… I have this friend and he said he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels . Have you eve heard of anything like that ?
CABLE GUY: You mean illegal cable ?
STEVEN: Uh… yes .
CABLE GUY: Who told you that ? I want his name .
STEVEN: Forget it .
CABLE GUY: You 're offering me a bribe ? What you have just done is illegal , and in this state if convicted , you could be fined five-thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional facility .
STEVEN: Please… that was dumb . I was just making conversation –
CABLE GUY: I 'm just jerking your chain . Wake up little snoozy . I 'll juice you up . All it is is a push of a button .
STEVEN: Oh , great . How much ?
CABLE GUY: Do n't worry about it . I could n't charge you . Your girl just booted you . Consider it one guy doing another guy a solid .
STEVEN: That is so nice .
CABLE GUY: Hey , you 're a 'nice ' guy . You 'd be surprised how many customers treat you like shit , like I 'm a god damn plumber o something . Here is my personal beeper number . It 's just for my preferred customers . Neve call the company , they 'll just put you on hold .
STEVEN: Thanks . Really . You 're gon na get some good marks here .
CABLE GUY: Maybe some day I 'll take you out to the satellite and show you how all this stuff works . It 's really incredible .
STEVEN: Sure . We should do that one day .
CABLE GUY: How 'bout tomorrow ?
STEVEN: Tomorrow ? Tomorrow 's not good .
CABLE GUY: What are you going to do , sit home and stew about your ex ?
STEVEN: No .
CABLE GUY: Oh , okay . I guess I crossed the line . Sorry .
STEVEN: You did n't cross the line .
CABLE GUY: No ? Cool . I 'll pick you up at six-thirty . On the flip side .
STEVEN: …There are twenty-four classrooms ; each can be converted into a 1400 square foot home . The facility has two tennis courts , an Olympic size pool and full gym , with a stage if the residents decide they want to perform `` Oklahoma . ''
MR. DANIELS: Great work Steve-o . So you 're feeling good ?
STEVE: Yeah .
MR. DANIELS: Did I hear something about you having some troubles at home ?
STEVE: Robin and I have been having a difficult time . I moved out , but I really think it 's only temporary .
MR. DANIELS: Gotcha . I love this project , but it 's a ig mother . Know what I mean ? If it fails , corporate 's going to have my ass . I 've got confidence in you , but you hea where I 'm coming from , bro ?
STEVEN: Absolutely . Now I 've got more time than ever . It 's a good thing . I know I can pull this thing off .
MR. DANIELS: Then what are you doing talking to me ? You 've got a lot of work to do . Get to it !
STEVEN: Thank you . I will .
STEVEN: Hello . Robin 's face drops .
ROBIN: Steven , what are you doing here ?
STEVEN: I was just in the area . Thought I 'd pop y . How 's work ? How 'd the big teen crush article come out ?
ROBIN: They liked it . I thought we agreed we were n't going to see each other for a month .
STEVEN: I know , it 's just Daniels accepted my proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse .
ROBIN: That 's wonderful , congratulations .
STEVEN: I know I 'm breaking the rules , but come have dinner with me tonight to celebrate .
ROBIN: I do n't think we should .
STEVEN: Come on , this is the biggest day of my career .
ROBIN: Do n't put me in this position .
STEVEN: What position ? I want to share this with you .
ROBIN: I love you , but I need to take some time on my own to see how I feel . You agreed to this . I mean… this is exactly why we oke up , because you never listen to me .
STEVE: What ? Now we 're broken up ? What happened to 'trial separation ? '
ROBIN: I ca n't get into this now . If you have n't noticed , I 'm at work .
STEVE: Sorry to disturb you . He turns to leave .
ROBIN: Steven . Congratulations . I know how much this means to you . You deserve it .
STEVEN: Thanks . He leaves .
CABLE GUY: Steven ! ! ! ! Hey buddy ! ! ! Come on down ! ! !
REPORTER: Coming up next a special report , `` Loneliness , America 's Silent Killer . ''
STEVEN: What the hell .
CABLE GUY: Howdy partner . Climb aboard . Steven gets in .
STEVEN: Where exactly are we goin ?
CABLE GUY: We 're going to take a ride on the information superhighway .
STEVEN: That 's pretty impressive .
CABLE GUY: See , I knew the moment I met you that you would appreciate this .
STEVEN: I 've watched a lot of TV in my life . I guess I 've always taken it for granted .
CABLE GUY: When I was a kid my mom worked nights . Never met dad . But the old TV was always there for me .
STEVEN: I know what you mean . My dad was there , ut he might as well have been gone . My mom is a stewardess . She was always out of town .
CABLE GUY: That 's tough . You must have a lot of abandonment issues . Reality is n't `` Fathe Knows Best , '' it 's a kick in the face on Saturday night . But what does n't kill us makes us stronger , right ?
STEVEN: You know my brother 's a speech therapist . The Cable Guy sits up . He looks angry .
CABLE GUY: So ?
STEVEN: Never mind .
CABLE GUY: So , you 're pretty love struck about you lady , huh ?
STEVEN: I miss her . I asked her to marry me , and she asked me to move out .
CABLE GUY: I hate that .
STEVEN: She said she felt pressured . Can you elieve that ?
CABLE GUY: Women are a labyrinth . Can I be frank ? I do n't think you listen to her . I think you try to tell her what she wants to hear . She wants you to thirst fo knowledge about who she is . All the complicated splendor that is woman . When your love is truly giving , it will come ack to you ten-fold .
STEVEN: You 're right . That is remarkably insightful .
CABLE GUY: Yeah , it was Jerry Springer 's final thought on Friday 's show .
STEVEN: Robin loves that movie .
CABLE GUY: They all do . Next time you talk to he tell her you 're cooking yourself dinner , and watching it by yourself . Sound like you 're happier than a pig in shit . She 'll come running . Betcha . Then just play it cool .
STEVEN: Maybe I will . Steven gets out of the car .
CABLE GUY: You really want to know my name ? You do ? Really ? It 's Ernie Douglas . But my friends call me Chip .
STEVEN: I 'll see ya ' Chip .
CABLE GUY: Let 's just remember right now . You know some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true friend . I guess we 're the lucky ones .
STEVEN: Uh… good-bye .
CABLE GUY: Later buddy . I 'll catch ya ' on the flip side .
STEVEN: I do n't listen to you . I pretend to understand but I 'm really just saying what I think you want to hear . So from now on I 'm going to try my best to listen more because I do love you and am interested in learning about every detail about the complicated splendor that is you . Robin looks at him , somewhat shocked .
ROBIN: Oh .
STEVEN: I want us to get back together , but I can see why taking this time might be good for us . So , I 'm not mad . After a long beat , Robin smiles .
ROBIN: Sometimes time apart is healthy .
STEVEN: You 're right . Well , that 's what I came here to say . Look , I 've got to get back to the office . He starts getting up .
ROBIN: So , are you doing anything tomorrow ?
STEVEN: I 'm just going to cook myself dinner and watch a movie . `` Sleepless in Seattle '' is on cable .
ROBIN: Really ?
STEVEN: If you 're around you should drop by and check out the new apartment .
ROBIN: Okay , maybe I will .
TABITHA SOREN: Today in the Sam Sweet case the prosecution played the 911 call that Sam Sweet made the night he murdered his other . Keep in mind , he confessed one month later .
911 OPERATOR: Slow down sir . What happened ?
SAM SWEET: Oh my god , they shot him with a shot gun four times . I mean I think it was a shotgun . Who would do such a thing ? ! I think it was an Asian gang or something . They were speaking some other language .
TABITHA SOREN: Hmm . Who indeed ? Coming up next , a rare interview with Michael Jackson 's zoo- keeper .
STEVEN: Here , here , here .
RICK: Shit ! My fault ! My fault !
STEVEN: Not your fault . I 'm in the zone . There is no stopping me today .
CABLE GUY: Hey , you guys play here , too ? Cool . I was just in the neighborhood . Thought I 'd un the court for a couple of innings .
RICK: Great . We need another man .
STEVEN: This is… Chip Douglas… my cable guy . Rick smiles in recognition .
CABLE GUY: We met about a week ago during a routine installation , but I feel like I 've known him my whole life . Steven ca n't believe this is happening .
RICK: Oh really . That 's sweet . All right Chip Douglas , you 're on shirts . Let 's play .
CABLE GUY: No , I want to be on Steven 's team . I 'm skins .
JEFF: I do n't care , I 'll be shirts . Let 's just play .
CABLE GUY: Wait a sec ' . I 've got to warm up .
STEVEN: Are you any good ?
CABLE GUY: Feed me under the boards and you 'll find out .
RICK: Yeah , whatever you say Chip . Everyone runs down the court , ignoring him .
CABLE GUY: All right , so we 're playing that type of game . Prison rules . I get it .
STEVEN: What are you doing ?
CABLE GUY: Do n't play from fear Steven . We can take these guys .
STEVEN: Yeah . I 'm fine .
CABLE GUY: Let 's switch . I 'll cover Rick .
RICK: What the hell was that ? That 's it . I 've had enough . Everyone begins to exit the court .
JEFF: Thanks for bringing your `` friend '' . The Cable Guy runs up to Rick .
CABLE GUY: Good game . You were tough out there . Your play ought me up to a higher level . I mean that .
RICK: Yeah .
STEVEN: What are you doing ?
CABLE GUY: It was payback time . I was protecting you .
STEVEN: You ruined the game .
CABLE GUY: I do n't appreciate your tone Steven . That 's not the way friends speak to each other .
STEVEN: What are you talking about ? I do n't even know you !
CABLE GUY: Well let 's fix that . Let me buy you a Heineken ?
STEVEN: No , I 'm going home . Steven turns to leave .
CABLE GUY: Well , uh , I guess we 'll talk later . I 've got to go shower up and do some stuff . I 'll call you if I get a chance . Or you call me… or something .
STEVEN: Yeah , have a good one .
MESSAGE VOICE: You have eleven messages .
STEVEN'S MOTHER: Steven , it 's mom . Give me a call . I 'm still your mother .
STEVEN'S FATHER: I 'm getting on . Steven call your mother .
CABLE GUY: Hey Steven . Just checking in . Give me a ing . I 'm at 555-4329 . What 's up Steven ? I 'm at a pay phone . If you 're there pick up . Pick up . Pick up . Okay , I 'll be home later . I 'll talk to you then . Steven stops chopping .
STEVEN: Hey , good to see you .
ROBIN: You made some interesting choices laying out the room .
STEVEN: That 's actually where the movers put the furniture . I 'm gon na change it , very soon .
ROBIN: No , I like it .
STEVEN: Work 's good .
ROBIN: How 's Hal ?
STEVEN: Do n't get me started . That guy has no vision . It 's like working for Mr. MaGoo . He 's just worthless .
ROBIN: It 's just great that you 're getting to do it . It 's a real step up .
STEVEN: I know . Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal , then I could really get some stuff done .
ROBIN: It 's nice to see you doing so well .
STEVEN: Well , it 's nice just to see you . Hey , it should be starting .
ROBIN: It 's alright . We can watch it anothe night .
STEVEN: No , no . We really should see it now . Now 's a good time .
CABLE GUY: Is there a problem with your service ?
STEVEN: Yeah… my cable went out . Steven pushes him out into the hall .
CABLE GUY: Really ? The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord .
STEVEN: I 've been really busy . You 've got to get my cable going , Robin is here . This is eally important .
CABLE GUY: But calling me back is n't ?
STEVEN: I 'm sorry . Please , you 've got to help me .
CABLE GUY: Why should I help you ? I gave you free cable . What have you ever done for me ?
STEVEN: Anything you want . Name it – quickly .
CABLE GUY: Tomorrow night , we hang out .
STEVEN: Fine , whatever you want .
CABLE GUY: God bless you . You 're too good to me .
STEVEN: So what 's with the cut cord ?
CABLE GUY: That 's for effect . See ya ' tomorrow Steven . She 's pretty . And do n't kiss her . Do n't even touch her . Fight the urge at all costs . It will pay off later with… He makes a motion which implies sex .
ROBIN: Who was that ?
STEVEN: Nobody .
CABLE GUY: Sorry about yesterday . I was in kind of a weird mood . How 'd things go with you ? Keep 'em closed .
STEVEN: Pretty well . We 'll see . Look , about the other night . I did n't appreciate you
CABLE GUY: Do n't peek . I want this to be a surprise .

STEVEN: You 're probably right .
CABLE GUY: Damn right I 'm right .
STEVEN: Oh , I got you a little something . He hands a box to the Cable Guy .
CABLE GUY: I thought you said we were even . You 're eaking the rules .
STEVEN: So shoot me .
CABLE GUY: Words can not express…
STEVEN: It 's no big deal .
CABLE GUY: Yes it is .
STEVEN: You 've got plenty of friends .
CABLE GUY: These people are acquaintances . They 're not ride to the airport friends , like us . Whoa , chick alert at three o'clock . A eal barn burner . Do n't look .
STEVEN: You 're playing with me again .
CABLE GUY: No sirree Steven . This woman is all ove you like a lamp-shade .
STEVEN: Shut up .
CABLE GUY: Did it just get hotter in here ? Oh , that hurts .
STEVEN: Who 'd she come with ?
CABLE GUY: I do n't know , but she looks pretty available to me . I 'd strike while the iron is hot . He who hesitates , masturbates , know what I 'm saying ?
ANGLE ON: A nerdy , balding man walks over to Rick .
ODD MAN: He sure can throw a party . Chip 's an incredible man . I really admire him .
RICK: Where do you know him from ?
ODD MAN: He hooked up my cable . Did n't charge me either . That 's the kind of guy he is .
ANGLE ON: Steven slowly walks over to the pretty woman .
STEVEN: Hey . I 'm Steven .
WOMAN: Heather .
STEVEN: Can I get you something to drink ?
HEATHER: Sure . I 'll have a shot of tequila if you will .
STEVEN: Coming right up .
CABLE GUY: I 'm glad you accepted my invitation .
RICK: Steven invited me . The Cable Guy looks at Steven and Heather .
CABLE GUY: Look at him . Have you ever seen him so alive ? He 's changing , Rick . You 've got to learn to live with that .
RICK: I do n't know what your story is `` Chip Douglas , '' but I 'm going to find out .
CABLE GUY: Oooh . How dramatic .
RICK: I 'm getting out of here .
STEVEN: Why ? This is a great party . This girl is really into me .
RICK: You 're whacked man . That guy is bad news .
STEVEN: You do n't even know him . You 're just mad 'cause he kicked your ass in basketball .
RICK: I ca n't even deal . I 'm outta here .
CABLE GUY: Hello everyone . First of all I 'd like to thank Steven for being such a terific host .
ODD MAN: Come on ! Do your song !
CABLE GUY: Okay , just to stop that guy from begging . This number is dedicated to all of the ladies in the house .
STEVEN: You sounded just like Olivia Newton John .
HEATHER: I 've been practicing for years .
STEVEN: So what do you do ?
HEATHER: I can barely hear you . Do you want to talk in the other room ?
STEVEN: Oh… okay . They walk into Steven 's bedroom .
STEVEN: She says she wants a break , and that 's fine with me . I think I needed some time also .
HEATHER: Yeah . I know what you mean . She leans in and kisses him .
STEVEN: Where did Heather go ?
CABLE GUY: I heard her slip out early this morning .
STEVEN: What a night . That was just what I needed .
CABLE GUY: You look like a new man .
STEVEN: I feel like a new man . I was getting so used to being rejected . I really liked her .
CABLE GUY: Hey , it was my treat .
STEVEN: What do you mean it was `` your treat ? ''
CABLE GUY: You know , I bought this time , you buy next time .
STEVEN: Buy what ?
CABLE GUY: You know , the women .
STEVEN: You mean Heather is a prostitute ?
CABLE GUY: Of course she is . Do you think a woman like that would hang out with us if we were n't paying ? Do n't tell me you did n't know .
STEVEN: I ca n't believe this . He sits in a chair , and leans over in pain .
CABLE GUY: She 's clean I assure you . I tried her out last week to make sure she was top quality , and I 'm as healthy as a horse . Not a drip . She 's the best , ask any of my friends . Steven cringes .
STEVE: You 've got to be kidding ? Please tell me she 's a friend of yours . You 're just playing with my mind again , right ?
CABLE GUY: I wish I had friends like that .
STEVEN: Get out of my house !
CABLE GUY: Do n't be ashamed of yourself . I know she was a working girl , but she kind of liked you . You might have been able to get a freebie .
STEVEN: Out , now ! I do n't ever want to see you again . Robin is never going to forgive me .
CABLE GUY: I 'll tell you how to handle that . Do n't tell her . You want to get her back , I 'll help you get her back .
STEVEN: I do n't want your help . I want you to leave . And take that stuff out of here .
CABLE GUY: Whatever . I can take a hint . I 'll see ya ' . The Cable Guy exits .
HOSTESS: May I help you ?
CABLE GUY: No , I 'm meeting someone here .
BATHROOM ATTENDANT: Most appreciated .
CABLE GUY: You 've been working hard . Take a break .
RAY: My brother and I wan na start our own sun lock company . But the twist is , it 's only for skiing . SkiBlock . Or SunSki . We have n't decided yet . Maybe BlockSki . Do you think that sounds good ?
ROBIN: BlockSki ? That sounds right .
RAY: So , Gail told me you 're just coming off a elationship .
ROBIN: Well , not really . We 're kind of in a holding pattern . He wants more of a commitment , but I do n't think I 'm ready . I just want to have a good time for a while .
RAY: Then we got to get you on a Skidoo !
ROBIN: Skidoo ?
RAY: High powered snow mobile . It 'll blow your mind . It flies over powder like it 's glass . Their waitress passes by .
ROBIN: It 's been crazy . They just hired a –
RAY: Hold that thought . I have to use the rest oom . Be right back .
MAN: Towel please .
CABLE GUY: My pleasure .
RAY: Yeah .
CABLE GUY: But I guess the weather 's always pleasant in here . The winters are remarkably mild .
RAY: I think I can handle it .
CABLE GUY: I 'm here to serve you .
RAY: Jesus ! Get out of here !
CABLE GUY: Most people never bother to take advantage of all my services , fo instance –
ANCHOR MAN: Here 's a bizarre story from downtown , where a man was beaten in a restroom by an assailant disguised as a bathroom attendant . The victim has been unable to speak since the unmotivated attack .
CABLE GUY: Excuse me , apartment 202 is Robin Harris ?
FEMALE NEIGHBOR: It 's right upstairs .
ROBIN: Who is it ?
CABLE GUY: It 's the Cable Guy .
ROBIN: There 's no problem with my cable .
CABLE GUY: I 've got an upgrade order for one Robin Harris . The Rainbow package , that 's every pay channel available .
ROBIN: I did n't order this .
CABLE GUY: Apparently you 've got a secret admirer .
ROBIN: Was it a man named Steven ?
CABLE GUY: I ca n't tell you .
ROBIN: Come on .
CABLE GUY: No , I promised Steven I would n't say . He gave it away on purpose . They both laugh .
ROBIN: So , are you a friend of Steven 's ?
CABLE GUY: I 'm proud to say I am . I installed his cable recently , and we just hit it off .
ROBIN: That 's right . You fixed his cable the other night . So you guys are going out a lot ?
CABLE GUY: Not really . That man is devoted to you . You know I 'm probably crossing a boundary telling you this , but he 's really crazy about you .
ROBIN: Did he say that ?
CABLE GUY: Only every five minutes . Quite frankly , I 'm sick of hearing it . No , I 'm just kidding with you . He 's a good man . He mentioned that you guys have had some problems .
ROBIN: Well , it 's a little complicated .
CABLE GUY: It always is . You know I asked a woman to marry me once . She said she wanted to think about it . We agreed to take some time apart to re-assess our feelings . To give each other… space . Well , she is no longer with us .
ROBIN: I 'm so sorry .
CABLE GUY: Sometimes you do n't have the time you think you have . Just promise me you 'll never go bungee jumping in Mexico .
ROBIN: I promise .
CABLE GUY: Anyway , I 've got to go .
STEVEN: Hello ?
ROBIN: Yes .
STEVEN: I… love you too .
ROBIN: That was so sweet of you .
STEVEN: Oh… well…
ROBIN: You did n't have to do that .
STEVEN: I… wanted to .
ROBIN: Giving me free cable . Only you would do that .
STEVEN: You got it ? Great .
ROBIN: Yes , your friend came by .
STEVEN: My friend ?
ROBIN: The Cable Guy . I liked him . He was kind of goofy , but nice . Thank you so much for doing that .
STEVEN: I'm… glad you liked it . I 've wanted to do something nice for you , but I 've been trying to give you your space .
ROBIN: Well , I do n't think we should make rules anymore .
STEVE: Okay .
ROBIN: Call me later if you 're around ?
STEVEN: Sure . I 'll call you as son as I get home . Bye .
RICK: What ?
STEVEN: Robin just called . I think we 're getting ack together .
RICK: So you 're blowing me off ? I ca n't elieve this .
STEVEN: This is the first time she asked to get ack together .
RICK: You do this every time . You only call me after a girl breaks your heart . `` Oh Rick can I stay on your couch ? Let 's talk all night about how mean girls are . '' Then as soon as a relationship starts again it 's bye-bye Rick . I do n't know why I fall for it anymore .
STEVEN: Ca n't you get someone else to go ?
RICK: Maybe I 'll take MY cable guy .
CABLE GUY: Pretty smooth work . I set 'em up , you knock 'em down .
STEVEN: What ?
CABLE GUY: Robin . I got her back for you . I juiced her up .
STEVEN: How do you know we 're back together ?
CABLE GUY: Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac .
STEVEN: I do n't want you messing around with my life . You 've caused enough trouble as it is .
CABLE GUY: I know . I felt bad about the other night , so I wanted to make it up to you . So what are you doing ? Do you want to catch a bite ? Steve looks the Cable Guy in the eye .
STEVEN: Look , I appreciate you helping me out with Robin . But you have to understand , I 'm going to have to work extra hard to not screw this relationship up again . You 're a great guy , but I just do n't have any room in my life for a new friend . Do you understand ?
CABLE GUY: I appreciate your honesty . You 're a real straight shooter .
STEVEN: So , you 're okay ?
CABLE GUY: Hey , I 'm a big boy . It 's no big deal . Whatever .
STEVEN: All right… well , take care .
CABLE GUY: Have a good one .
ROBIN: Are you alright ?
STEVEN: I 'm fine . They go back to kissing .
CABLE GUY: Hey , it 's Chip Douglas .
ROBIN: Chip Douglas ?
CABLE GUY: Your cable guy .
ROBIN: Oh , hi . What 's up ?
CABLE GUY: I feel kind of weird calling you . It 's just… I 'm worried about Steven .
ROBIN: What is it ?
CABLE GUY: Something is n't right . He has n't been himself lately . Have you noticed anything ?
ROBIN: No , things are actually going really well .
CABLE GUY: Good .
ROBIN: Should I be worried ?
CABLE GUY: Nope . I 'm probably just being a nervous nellie . Let 's just keep our eyes open .
ROBIN: I will . Good-bye . She hangs up , then dials Steven 's number .
JOAN: Sorry Robin . He 's in a meeting .
SALES MANAGER: The response to our initial offering has een remarkable . A local investment group has decided to buy the entire complex and turn them into rentals . In etrospect I must admit we made one big mistake . Everyone hangs on his every word .
MR. DANIELS: I just want to put this out there , Stevey . You did it bro . You laid you cajones , and mine , out on the table , and you slam dunked it . Way to go . Now watch , they 'll kick you upstairs ahead of me . All right , in othe usiness…
JOAN: Pssst . Steven .
STEVEN: It can wait .
POLICE OFFICER: Is there a Steven Bartowsky here ?
STEVEN: Uh… I 'm Steven Bartowsky . What 's going on ?
POLICE OFFICER: You are under arrest .
MR. DANIELS: On what charge ?
POLICE OFFICER: Receipt of stolen merchandise .
STEVEN: What ? I never –
POLICE OFFICER: Please put our hands on the table .
STEVE: This is all a mistake . I did n't accept any stolen goods .
STEVEN: Hey , relax . I 'm the one who 's going to jail . Nobody laughs . He exits .
EARL: I ca n't believe you did this .
STEVEN: I did n't do anything . My cable guy gave me all that stuff as a present .
EARL: A stereo system and a big screen TV as a present ? You expect me to believe that ? You know you 're killing your mother with this .
STEVEN: I swear it 's true .
EARL: Why would you accept such extravagant gifts ?
STEVEN: I do n't know . I should n't have .
EARL: What is really going on here Steven ? Are you on something ?
STEVEN: I 'm fine ! I did n't do anything ! Please call my cable guy , his name is Ernie Douglas .
LAWYER: Steven , the police looked into it , nobody named Ernie Douglas works for 'The Cable Company . '
EARL: You want to tell us the truth now
STEVEN: That 's got to be a mistake . Oh , this is not happening .
EARL: Yes it is , and it 's killing your mother . Did you deliberately want to ruin ou fortieth anniversary party on Monday , Steven ?
STEVEN: Yeah , Dad , I did . It 's all a big plan . When can you get me out of here ?
LAWYER: Unfortunately it 's too late to get a bail hearing today . You 're going to have to spend the weekend in county lock up .
STEVEN: The entire weekend ?
PRISONER #1: New meat ! Look at the pretty boy !
PRISONER #2: Nobody touches him , he 's mine ! You touch him , you 're dead !
PRISONER #3: Is baby scared ? Do n't cry baby !
ANGRY PRISONER: Ooh , looks like I won the lottery .
STEVEN: What did you hear ? What did you hear ?
CABLE GUY: Hello Steven . I came as soon as I heard . Steven 's head sinks .
STEVEN: Who are you ? ! What 's your real name ? !
CABLE GUY: So many questions .
STEVEN: Why are you doing this to me ?
CABLE GUY: I did n't do this to you , you did this to you . You need to learn who your friends are .
STEVEN: You set me up .
CABLE GUY: I taught you a lesson . I can be your best friend , or your worst enemy . I hope you 'll choose the latter… I mean , the former . You know what I mean .
STEVEN: I 'll never be your friend . You need help .
CABLE GUY: Right now I think you 're the one who needs help . I 'm here to give you comfort . The Cable Guy huts his hand up to the glass .
STEVEN: I will not touch it .
CABLE GUY: I know how you 're feeling right now .
STEVEN: Stop it ! Stop it !
CABLE GUY: I 'm here for you .
STEVEN: Get off there ! Are you trying to get me killed ? The Cable Guy begins to laugh .
CABLE GUY: I was just messing with your mind . That was from 'Midnight Express . ' Awesome film . Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for the screenplay .
STEVEN: Guard ! Guard !
CABLE GUY: Do n't you worry about Robin , I 'll make sure she 's well taken care of .
STEVEN: You go near her , I 'll kill you .
CABLE GUY: Louis , how 'd you like that Tyson fight on Pay Per View ? I told you it 's more fun when it 's Free Per View . They both laugh . The door closes behind them .
ROBIN: Hello .
CABLE GUY: Hello . I 'm sorry we have to meet unde these circumstances .
ROBIN: Me too . Believe me .
CABLE GUY: I know we do n't know each other very well , but we do have one thing in common , our concern for Steven .
ROBIN: Well , you were right . Something 's happening with him and he wo n't even acknowledge it .
CABLE GUY: If he refuses to admit he has a problem , we may have to let him hit bottom . He 's gon na need some tough love .
ROBIN: You know his lawyer said that nobody named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable Company .
CABLE GUY: Did he do a name search ? 'Cause I work under a pseudonym so the customers wo n't harass me at home . Kind of like a stripper . My real name is Larry , Larry Tate .
ROBIN: And he 's saying he received all the stereo equipment from you .
CABLE GUY: ( I know , and I 'm not mad . He 's been cornered , so he 's telling some wives tales . He does n't mean to hurt me .
ROBIN: I just feel like I triggered this with him . It 's not that I do n't want to get married , it 's just I felt like he wanted to get married just to get married . I do n't deal well with pressure .
CABLE GUY: Hey , welcome to the human race . We 're not perfect . We all think we have to look like a 'Baywatch ' babe and be as witty as 'Seinfeld . ' Give yourself a eak .
ROBIN: God I could go for turkey and mashed potatoes now .
CABLE GUY: Comfort food . Bring it on .
ROBIN: Exactly . She laughs .
CABLE GUY: You 've got a great laugh . Can I make a small request ? I 'd like to hear it a little more often . She blushes .
BARRY NOLAN: The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into chaos as a result of a videotape made a month after the killing . In this `` Hard Copy '' exclusive an apparently intoxicated Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his friends at a party . The judge has not decided whether this tape is admissible as evidence .
SAM SWEET: Hey everyone . Look it 's me and… my brother Stan . Hi Stan . It 's so nice to see you . How are you feeling ? Look , he 's alive . Sam punches the mirror , shattering it .
STEVEN: I 'm sorry dad .
EARL: I do n't want to hear it . Do you know the pain you out your mother through ? You 're lucky she did n't die of a heart attack .
STEVEN: I did n't do anything .
EARL: Just like you said you did n't steal that ' X-Men ' comic book when you were eight . Then I found it in your underwear drawer .
STEVEN: Will you ever stop mentioning that ?
EARL: This cost me a lot of money . You jump ail , and I swear I 'll hire a bounty hunter to hunt you down .
ROBIN: Are you sure you 're okay ?
STEVEN: I 'm fine .
ROBIN: You 're not fine . When you say you 're fine , I know you 're not fine .
STEVEN: I just want to get this over with so I can go home and get some rest .
ROBIN: I wanted you to know I invited you friend . He was concerned about you .
STEVEN: Great . I feel . Bad . I 've been kind of lowing Rick off lately . He rings the doorbell .
ROBIN: Not Rick .
CABLE GUY: You can only come in if you came to rage .
STEVEN: What is he doing here ?
ROBIN: I invited him .
STEVEN: When did you invite him ?
ROBIN: At lunch the other day .
STEVEN: At lunch ? You had lunch with him ? The Cable Guy walks over .
ROBIN: Hello . You look great .
CABLE GUY: And you are a vision . Hello Steven . You 're looking rested .
STEVEN: Come here . He pulls the Cable Guy aside .
CABLE GUY: Steven , what 's with you tonight ? I 'm getting some really weird energy from you .
STEVEN: Maybe it 's because I just got out of prison , where you sent me . I should just drag you to the police right now .
CABLE GUY: You can if you like , but I 'd hate to have to show Robin this .
STEVEN: You son of a bitch . The Cable Gut quickly puts it away .
CABLE GUY: Come on Steven , let 's just have a good time tonight . Robin , Earl and Steven 's mother walk over .
EARL: Steven , your mother and I had a long talk with your friend Larry here when he came over to screw in the cable .
STEVEN'S MOTHER: Thank you again for that .
EARL: We owe you an apology . I did n't realize the seriousness of your problems . You 're obviously going through some kind of personal hell and I need to be more understanding . We did n't get involved with things like that when I was you age .
STEVEN'S MOTHER: You 've got a good friend here .
PETE: Hey buddy , we 're with you . Keep you chin up .
CABLE GUY: So Steven is carrying this battle ax , and he 's chasing me , swinging like a mad man . I 'm yelling at him , 'hey , it 's just a show ! '
STEVEN'S SISTER: He always takes things too seriously .
CABLE GUY: Tell me something I do n't know . This guy almost took my head off . Everybody laughs .
STEVEN: What are you doing ?
CABLE GUY: It 's from `` Goodfellas . '' Remember the intro scene at the bar . I 'm Johnny Two Times .
STEVEN: Very funny . Tony , go to your mother ! Tony immediately starts crying . He leaves .
CABLE GUY: Look what you 've done .
STEVEN: I know you beat up Robin 's date . The Cable Guy 's laughter stops on a dime .
CABLE GUY: I guess I did what you did n't have the guts to do .
STEVEN: You stay away from Robin .
CABLE GUY: Do n't mess with me . I 'm feeling like a part of the family , and I like it . You should try it sometime . Steven 's mother enters .
STEVEN'S MOTHER: My , you two look like brothers . Come on ack , we 're all having coffee in the living room .
CABLE GUY: Are you guys trying to fatten me up ? 'Cause if you are , you 're doing a damn good job of it . He laughs , and exits . Steven slowly follows .
EARL: No , but I like the sound of it .
CABLE GUY: It 's the adult version of the popula television game show . Robin you 're on my team . Steven , you 're with mom . You 're the audience .
STEVEN: I really do n't want to play this game . Woman . Woman .
STEVEN'S MOTHER: Uh… man ?
STEVEN: No .
CABLE GUY: Pe-nis . Pe-nis . Pe-nis .
ROBIN: Vagina ?
CABLE GUY: Yes ! He high fives Robin . Everyone laughs .
EARL: I thought it was going to be schlong ! Whoops .
CABLE GUY: The password is… nipple .
STEVEN: Can I pass ?
EARL: Come on Steven , do n't be a stick in the mud .
STEVEN: Breast . Breast .
STEVEN'S MOTHER: Tit ? Everyone laughs . Steven 's face is red .
CABLE GUY: Hard…
ROBIN: Erection ?
STEVEN: Center . Center .
STEVEN'S MOTHER: Nipple ? Everyone cheers .
CABLE GUY: I wish you did , 'cause we 'd be ahead .
STEVEN: I ca n't say that to my mother !
EARL: Hey , she 's a grown woman . She can handle it .
ROBIN: Come on Steven . We 're just having fun .
STEVEN: No , I 've had enough . I ca n't do this . This guy is ruining my life , I wo n't sit here and play X-rated party games with him .
EARL: Steven , I really think you 're over- eacting .
STEVEN: I am not over-reacting . You 're all being fooled by this guy ! He 's a felon fo Christ sake ! I hate you ! Get out of my life !
CABLE GUY: I 'm sorry everyone . If I am a nuisance , I will leave . I would never stay where I am not wanted .
ROBIN: You 're not a nuisance . Please do n't go . Steven , you 're being an asshole .
EARL: Yeah , Steven it seems like you 're the one with the problem .
STEVEN: What ? You have no idea what this guy is eally like .
CABLE GUY: I 'll just go .
STEVEN: See what I mean !
CABLE GUY: Steven , what 's with you tonight ? Robin showed me that birthmark on he left shoulder . It 's very sexy .
ROBIN: I ca n't believe you . The Cable Guy gets up .
CABLE GUY: I 'm fine . Thank you for a delightful evening . I forgive you .
STEVEN: You do n't understand .
ROBIN: I just think you were completely out of line . I do n't know what 's happening to you these days . Steven gets fed up .
STEVEN: Robin , this guy is a sociopath . He leaves messages on my machine night and day . He shows up wherever I go . He wo n't leave me alone .
ROBIN: Sounds familiar .
STEVEN: You know he was the one who beat up you date at that restaurant . That 's right . And he gave you the free cable . It was n't me .
ROBIN: But you took the credit for it ?
STEVEN: That 's what he wanted . He was manipulating me . It feels so good to be honest about this . We 're finally communicating . I 've been wanting to tell you for so long , but he 's been lackmailing me .
ROBIN: Blackmailing you ? How ?
STEVEN: With a photograph .
ROBIN: Of what ?
STEVEN: Me with a prostitute .
ROBIN: What ? !
STEVEN: He set it up . He invited this woman to my party and did n't tell me she was a prostitute . I 'm so glad we can talk about this .
ROBIN: When did you have a party ?
STEVEN: When we were n't communicating . I invited you . You were out on a date .
ROBIN: And you were with a prostitute .
STEVEN: She seduced me . That 's what they do . They 're professionals . And I did n't even know she was a prostitute .
ROBIN: So that makes it better ?
STEVEN: That 's not the point . The point is this guy has been setting me up . He 's esponsible .
ROBIN: He did n't have sex with a whore . You did .
STEVEN: Robin you do n't
ROBIN: I do n't want to hear it . Breaking up was the best thing we ever did . You have some serious problems , and it 's not my esponsibility to help you . I am only esponsible for my own happiness .
STEVEN: Where did that come from ?
ROBIN: It was Jerry Springer 's `` final thought . '' She exits .
STEVEN: I 'm sorry I 've been blowing you off .
RICK: You bet your ass you 've been blowing me off .
STEVEN: It 's just , this guy is really doing a number on me .
RICK: I told you not to hang out with him .
STEVEN: You 're the one who told me to offer him money so I could get free cable .
RICK: You did n't tell me he was a psychopath . I 'll see if I can get my friend in esearch to track him down . What 's his name again ?
STEVEN: Ernie Douglas .
RICK: Ernie Douglas ? Ernie Douglas ? Why does that sound so familiar ?
STEVEN: Did anyone notice I 'm late ?
JOAN: What are you talking about , you 've been here for an hour .
STEVEN: Thank you . Steven walks to his office .
ROBIN: How 's Hal ?
STEVEN: Do n't get me started . That guy has no vision . It 's like working for Mr. MaGoo . He 's just worthless .
ROBIN: It 's just great that you 're getting to do it . It 's a real step up .
STEVEN: I know . Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal , then I could really get some stuff done .
HAL: Do n't worry . I did n't see it - 'cause I have no vision . Steven knows what 's coming .
STEVEN: Chip ! Chip , this is n't funny ! Where are you ? ! ! !
CABLE GUY: Oh no . It 's not over . It 's just gettin ' started .
MARK THOMPSON: The jury has notified the judge that they are very close to reaching a verdict , and would like to keep deliberating into the evening hours .
RESEARCHER: There are five people named Ernie Douglas in this county . Two are African American . One is eighty-five years old . One is eleven years old , and the last one is in a wheelchair .
RICK: So we 're nowhere . Ernie Douglas ? Ernie Douglas ? She begins tapping her foot nervously .
RESEARCHER: Do n't snap at me . I 'm doing this as a favor .
RICK: Wait , could you start that again ? Start tapping your foot again .
STEVEN: Hello .
RICK: I 've got a list of every cable installe fired in the last four years . Every one of these guys has the same physical description as our friend . Murray Slaughter , Brendan Walsh , Sam Malone , Alex Reiger . There was even a guy who liked to be called 'the big Ragu . '
STEVEN: Carmine from `` Laverne and Shirley . ''
RICK: That 's so sad that you know that . Anyway , the cable company in town fired a guy six months ago named Darren Stevens . He stole the truck and disappeared . That 's our guy .
STEVEN: So he does n't even work for the Cable Company ?
CABLE GUY: This man killed his own brother . Some people do n't even have a brother
RICK: Why do you keep icing me man ?
CABLE GUY: You owe me !
CABLE GUY: Steven , you 're just like me . We 're cut from the same cloth . We 're one and the same !
STEVEN: Oh my god . She 's right . I am a smotherer . I 'm just like him . The phone rings .
CABLE GUY: Do you feel good now that you 've hurt me ? Well now I 'm going to have to hurt you . I 'm going to take away what you hold dearest in the world .
STEVEN: Do n't do this . There must be some way for us to work this out .
CABLE GUY: I wish there was . Oh Steven , I 'm just so tired . So very tired .
STEVEN: Let 's talk in person . Where are you ?
CABLE GUY: I 'm close . So very close .
STEVEN: You stay away from her .
CABLE GUY: Are n't we the control freak . Looks like you 're starting to sweat .
STEVEN: I got the camera . You ca n't see me . Steven begins to pick his face .
CABLE GUY: Oh yeah ? Then why are you picking you face ?
RICK: Hello .
STEVEN: Hey Rick . I need to meet with you right away . I 've got some information about this crazy cable guy .
RICK: Me too . I 've got the whole story .
STEVEN: That 's great . Let 's meet at the old school at nine-thirty .
RICK: Why all the way out there ?
STEVEN: I think he 's been following me . Do n't be late , buddy .
FEMALE NEIGHBOOR: Go away ! I remember you . You 're he obsessive boyfriend . She said you might come here . I 'm calling the police . She closers her door . He runs off .
RICK: Steven ? Steven ?
STEVEN: Hey Rick . I 'm really excited to hea what you found out about this nut .
RICK: I hit the Holy Grail . This guy is deeply troubled . Only child . His mother was arrested for prostitution , and phone solicitation . Apparently she was some phone sex pioneer .
STEVEN: No way .
RICK: And get this , he was discharged from the Marines . He got mad at his Sergeant so he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two using a Radio Shack computer . And that 's not the half of it .
CABLE GUY: Really ? Tell me more .
STEVEN: Hello .
STEVEN: Rick Legatos . He 's a friend of mine . Where is he ?
DOCTOR: Room 205 .
STEVEN: Can I see him ?
DOCTOR: Yes . But he ca n't speak . He 's in shock .
STEVE: Ring ?
STEVEN: Hello .
CABLE GUY: The question is , are you going to get away with it ? Apparently there was an anonymous tip placed to the police leading them to a staple gun at the crime scene with your fingerprints all over it .
ROBIN: All right , I 'm ready .
CABLE GUY: Be right there .
STEVEN: Was that Robin ?
CABLE GUY: I 've got to go . We 're going to take a omantic stroll on the information superhighway .
OFFICER: Hey , hold it !
CABLE GUY: it all started in Lansford , Pennsylvania where Panther Valley Television , with the assistance of Jerrod Electronics , created the first cable television system .
ROBIN: This is really fascinating , but I really think we ought to go now .
CABLE GUY: I knew you 'd appreciate it . I took Steven here once , and he did n't give a ats ass about my interests .
ROBIN: I 'm worried about Steven .
CABLE GUY: Maybe Steven should be worried about you . So , where was I ?
CABLE GUY: Ichabod Crane ! The Disney Channel showed it all last month . The Cable Guy rides toward him again .
STEVEN: Where 's Robin ? !
CABLE GUY: This is n't about Robin , this is about you and me . Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy .
STEVEN: Where 's Robin ? ! ! !
CABLE GUY: I 'm sorry , I did n't catch the question ?
STEVEN: I got the point .
ROBIN: Steven . He looks to the dish , but can not see her .
CABLE GUY: Yeah Steven . Look out !
ROBIN: Steven ! Steven runs to her .
STEVEN: Hang on .
CABLE GUY: I know what your saying . Who does this guy think he is , Jason ?
STEVEN: Stay away from her !
CABLE GUY: I saw that in Trapeze , starring Tony Curtis . He was just on `` Life-styles of the Rich and Famous . '' He still looks terrific .
ROBIN: I 'm sorry I did n't believe you . I love you .
STEVEN: I love you too . You 're right . We should n't get married . I 've got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you .
ROBIN: We 'll work them out together .
CABLE GUY: What just happened ? Where am I ? Oh yeah , I was trying to kill you .
STEVEN: Easy .
CABLE GUY: It did n't have to be this way Steven . I 'm just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you mistreat people .
STEVEN: Do n't do anything stupid .
CABLE GUY: You know this is just like that secen in that Clint Eastwood movie `` Dirty Harry ''
STEVEN: No ! This is not like anything ! This is not a movie ! We 're real people ! You 're hurting us ! This is reality !
CABLE GUY: If this is reality I am outta here .
STEVEN: Nooo !
CABLE GUY: Yeah , but I get really lonely . I mean , look at me .
STEVEN: You 're gon na be fine . Just come on up .
CABLE GUY: Steven , I think I sat too close to the television . Mommy was right .
REPORTER: This is the moment America has been waiting for . We 've just been told the jury is ready to render their decision .
COURT CLERK: By unanimous vote the defendant Sam Sweet
CABLE GUY: Damn , that hurt like a mother . What the hell was I thinking ? Oh man , that stings . Steven and Robin look relieved .
STEVEN: Is he going to be all right ?

CABLE GUY: Am I really your buddy ?

THUG#2: Get some deep heat on it .
URI: If we 're kindly ready , Mister Tyne . Uri then goes back to reading his novel .
URI: Nicholas it 's really so very simple .
BOOTHY: Has the next of kin been informed ? Silk clears his throat .
SILK: Not yet sir .
BOOTHY: There 's never a good time .
SILK: Yes sir . Silk makes a note on his iPad .
URI: Our intelligence . . .
BOOTHY: As the board understood it , the prisoner was verified as the jihadi . There was DNA . . .
URI: We now believe the evidenced might have been contaminated .
BOOTHY: Was there any form of extraction ?
URI: The suspect revealed nothing of the activities of which he was suspected by the board , sir .
PARKER: Fruit was not born . 60 | P a g e
URI: It was a fruitless interrogation , sir - yes .
BOOTHY: So not only do we have no furthe intel about the event , we have another next of kin , a nuclear bloody winter of media fallout and the inevitable Whitehall storm . We also have another body to . . .
PARKER: Liquidate , sir ? Boothy ignores Parker almost entirely .
BOOTHY: It says here ` The suspect did not respond to the usual stimuli . Stimuli ? The usual . . .
URI: We explored the usual routes in accordance with our mandate .
SILK: If I may , sir . Perhaps he told you nothing because he knew nothing .
URI: That 's likely , yes .
BOOTHY: Likely ? Christ ! This is the kind of thing the media gorges on for months ! We ca n't . . . 61 | P a g e
URI: There is no need . Boothy looks at Uri . The others look at Uri .
BOOTHY: Spare me the party line , Uri , for God sake ! This 'll wiki itself sky high unless . . .
URI: It 's taken care of , sir .
BOOTHY: We 're getting off-message here .
PARKER: Mission creep . It should be funny but somehow it 's sick .
BOOTHY: What we 're here to establish is how a freelance writer get 's wrongly arrested , subjected to rendition and is then tortured by experts in the certainty that he is in fact a terrorist planning acts against the common good . On home soil against the Great British public et cetera . He was as innocent as any of us . Any answers , Uri ? 62 | P a g e Silence a beat , then
URI: Mistakes , happen , sir .
BOOTHY: The man wrote a column for the Economist , for God sake ! Silence a beat , then
URI: The best moles have the best covers , sir . They simply always do . Boothy looks at Uri in a particular way .
BOOTHY: What we also need to establish is whether he was killed deliberately , or by . . .
PARKER: Misadventure , sir ?
URI: The human body can only take so much , sir . Subjected to a certain level of pressure it uckles . Nicholas Pentane 's ody simply broke under duress .
SILK: The mind-body continuum .
URI: The mind-body continuum . Boothy reads something else on his laptop 63 | P a g e

URI: You did , sir , yes . Your wife actually sent us the brochure if you recall .
ELLE: Hello . Yes . Yes .
BOOTHY VO: We actually tried Corfu this year . Not bad ­ though it could have been warmer .
SILK VO: I can actually recommend Crete at this time of year . A bit populous , but there are places where one can escape the hordes . Elle drops the phone .

BOOTHY: Sharon could we get some more coffee please . Biscuits ? And some biscuits . The usual . Actually if there are any chocolate digestives .
SHARON OS: Certainly sir . 65 | P a g e
BOOTHY: Thanks Sharon .
URI: My desire to meet with you arises from a strong urge to inform you of the circumstances under which your husband actually passed away . The fact is , Mrs Pentane , that you have certainly been misinformed .
BOOTHY: Thanks Sharon .
PARKER: Never can resist the bloody things .
BOOTHY: Make yourself at home , minister . Boothy and Silk grab a biscuit . Uri sips his coffee . He REACTS .

ELLE: Can I get you anything ?
URI: No ­ really I 'm fine . Thank you .
ELLE: If you 'd kindly hurry . Please .
URI: Misses Pentane I . . .
ELLE: Oh for God sake !
URI: The fact is that your husband did not die in the manner in which you have been told he died . As I alluded in my letter , my email . . .
ELLE: I ca n't do this now . I 'm sorry .
URI: Misses Pentane please hear me . 70 | P a g e Why did I come here today ? Well , the truth is I believe you should have the facts . The facts are that . . .we believe your husband was wrongfully arrested and . . . She looks at him . No shit !
ELLE: You need to get the hell away from me . Sorry , but . . .
URI: Misses Pentane the fact is that your husband was subjected to endition . Not as you may have heard of it but in a form . . . She has to lean against the wall .
ELLE: Logistics ?
URI: He was subjected here , in the United Kingdom to a process designed to get him to confess .
BOOTHY: What we need to establish , Uri , is whether , having found out 71 | P a g e that you had made a mistake , you killed Nicholas Pentane deliberately , or whether his death was merely a product of of the processes to which he was being subjected .
URI: He was no longer any use . By that stage his body was , his mind . . .He would never have een able to lead an ordinary life work , have relationships .
BOOTHY: So you did the judicious thing and disposed of the suspect accordingly ?
URI: Your husband was tortured , Misses Pentane .
ELLE: DO N'T TOUCH ME !
URI: This is n't exactly what I came here to tell you , Misses . . . Not entirely . . .
ELLE: What are you ? Uri almost smiles . Little old me .
URI: That wo n't help much today .
ELLE: What the fuck do you think . . . Get out ­ now !
URI: I want . I want . . .
ELLE: Piece of shit-mould . Get out . . .
ELLE: Motherfucker . . .
URI: Yes Yes Yes . After a while she slows , exhausted .
ELLE: Piece of dogshit . . .
URI: Misses Pentane . . . the exertion . Please . . . He means her belly , her unborn child .
ELLE: What ? WHAT ? She is sobbing , broken , exhausted .
URI: I relieved him of his pain .
ELLE: Am I expected to admire . . . Leave me alone . She tries to open the door , to haul him out .
URI: It 's OK . I do n't want you to e . . . I 'll make up a story . Do n't worry . Actually I hate it all . I do as I 'm told , actually . Sometimes . . . 75 | P a g e She grabs the stone statue again and SWINGS .
ELLE: Get out .
URI: Do n't worry . Mum 's the word , Mrs Pentane . I 'll take care of everything . Everything . I promise . . .
AD VO: . . .not that you 'll be needing one now that your house assurance is on the house . Cheers !
MARLOW VO: My sense of it is , Christie , as I 've said , and the reason I feel I failed , really , is that the state must find a way to take responsibility .
MARLOW: I know . But look . For me it 's this we send her out to Afghanistan . We tell her to kill people who resisted our invasion . But 78 | P a g e anyway ­ look we make he an expert . A killing machine . And then war breaks our machine . So then our machine needs Post-Traumatic Stress Disorde drugs in order to function in normal life . To make a cup of tea , for God sake . She 's a broken child , Chrissie . We broke her . So then when she kills a known psychotic child molester and murderer in her home in the middle of the night ­ in he home - in self-defence ­ we , the state , we call that murder , and we throw her to the dogs . We screw her up in the name of a cause in some country some people - and lets ' face it , in a part of the world not many British people know o give a damn about - and then we finish the job . We prosecute he for murder and lock her up .
MARLOW VO: I understand . I understand that when you sign up , you take your chances . You become an organ of the state , and if that state tells you to kill people in its name , it chooses not to call that murder . It chooses then to call you a hero ­ especially if you die .

TRUMAN: We 're not looking for any inside information I do n't care one way or another if you catch whoever did this I 'm writing an article not about the Clutter killings , but how they 're affecting the town , how you all are bearing up
DEWEY: I care .
TRUMAN: Excuse me ?
DEWEY: I care . I care a great deal if we catch whoever did this .
TRUMAN: Yes
DEWEY: As do a lot of folks around here .
TRUMAN: Of course .
NYE: New Yorker ?
CHURCH: You have press credentials ?
NYE: What 's the New Yorker ?
CHURCH: Magazine .
TRUMAN: Magazines do n't give out
CHURCH: You can come to the news conference with the rest of them . Sears and Roebuck . Nelle and Truman are left alone .
DEWEY: I 'll talk facts but I wo n't speculate . The main fact here we need to be clear on is not one , but four people were killed . A lot of folks say He Clutter had to be the main target ecause he was dealt with the most utally
JOURNALIST #1: Had his throat cut .
DEWEY: Yes . We 'd all like to know why . But it could 've been any one of the family they were after . We just do n't know
JOURNALIST #2: You 've identified the murder weapon ?
DEWEY: Wounds indicate a shotgun , close- ange , but no casings were found .
JOURNALIST #1: Twelve-gauge , hunting
DEWEY: Right .
JOURNALIST #1: They were all shot in the face ? Dewey looks at the journalist . Then , evenly
DEWEY: No . Nancy in the back of the head .
JOURNALIST #2: Is there any evidence of , I 'm sorry , sexual molestation of the women ?
DEWEY: No .
JOURNALIST #2: Anything else stolen ?
DEWEY: Kenyon 's radio seems to be the only
JOURNALIST #3: The boy was sixteen ?
DEWEY: Fifteen . Nancy was sixteen .
JOURNALIST #2: It 's her friend that found them ?
DEWEY: Laura Kinney .
JOURNALIST #2: Spell that ?
DEWEY: I assume you 're okay with the Laura part . K-I-N-N-E-Y . But , please , leave her be .
OLD MAN: There 's talk of a bunch of Mexicans , a whole bunch of Mexicans
DEWEY: George , it 's good to see you again . I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole unch , as you said , but it does n't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos . We 're going to find whoever did this . Four good people from our community are dead . Let 's remember that . Okay with you ? The West Kansas Farm Committee 's offering a thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest . Please print that . Thank you all for coming .
TRUMAN: Mr. Dewey 's protective of the Clutters . I wonder how well he knew them Nelle glances over at him . He does n't notice .
NELLE: Truman , you 're a menace . You can arely see over the wheel .
TRUMAN: Not even a little bit . He leans his head out , closes his eyes .
NELLE: Morning .
GIRL #1: Hi .
NELLE: Can any of you tell me where I 'd find Laura Kinney ?
GIRL #1: Oh , um
NELLE: Is that her ? With the tall boy ?
GIRL #2: Yeah . With Danny Burke .
NELLE: Danny Burke ? Thank you . As Nelle leaves , Girl # 1 turns to her friend
GIRL #2: Oh , quiet yourself , Janice .
NELLE: Truman . Truman
TRUMAN: What
NELLE: I 'm gon na find out where those two kids live . Maybe you 'll let me do that alone ?
TRUMAN: You hate my friends .
JACK: I would n't say hate . So long as they do n't knock on my door .
TRUMAN: I saw the bodies today .
JACK: Which ?
TRUMAN: The Clutters . I looked inside the coffins .
JACK: That 's horrifying .
TRUMAN: It comforts me something so horrifying it 's freeing . It 's a elief . Normal life falls away . But , then , I was never much for normal life
JACK: No , you were n't .
TRUMAN: People here wo n't talk to me . They want someone like you , like Nelle . Me they hate .
JACK: I ca n't think of a single quality I share with Nelle .
TRUMAN: Well
JACK: Maybe manliness .
TRUMAN: My point exactly .
JACK: It 's why I left the Midwest in the first place . I knew I could only find someone like you in New York City .
NELLE: Let 's go .
LAURA: I thought you were from the FBI with your long coat .
TRUMAN: Is that so ?
LAURA: That 's why I ran off .
TRUMAN: I 've been getting a lot of that lately .
LAURA: It 's fine talking to you all . Practically nobody around here wants to talk since what happened .
NELLE: Folks have been through a rough patch . Including you . Nancy was your best friend .
LAURA: She was my best friend . They 're quiet for a few moments .
NELLE: How has Danny been ?
LAURA: Pretty shattered . Nothing terrible ever happened to him before . Nancy just started wearing his ring again after this huge fight Mr. Clutte was trying to get her to end it 'cause Danny 's Catholic .
NELLE: What were the Clutters ?
LAURA: Methodist . Danny was the last person at the house that night . That 's why Mr. Dewey 's keeps interviewing him they do n't think he had anything to do with it just to see if he emembers anything unusual and all .
NELLE: People in town seem to wonder if he was involved .
LAURA: That 's been real hard for Danny .
TRUMAN: Oh , it 's the hardest when people have a notion about you and it 's impossible to convince them otherwise . Since I was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way I look and the way I talk . They 're always wrong . Do you know what I mean ?
LAURA: I want to show you something .
TRUMAN: Not one person here understands her .
LAURA: Maybe you 'll get a better picture of Nancy . And the family .
NELLE: What is this ?
LAURA: It 's her diary .
NELLE: `` Danny here tonight and we watched TV . So nice just having him sit with us . Left at eleven . P.S . He 's the only one I really love . ''
TRUMAN: The end of a life .
NELLE: `` Shattered . ''
TRUMAN: `` Pretty shattered . Nothing terrible ever happened to him before. `` He pushes some pillows aside and lies down .
NELLE: 94 percent .
TRUMAN: I 've tested myself .
NELLE: I hate that you 're better than me at this .
TRUMAN: I do n't snore
NELLE: while I lay there , hating you
TRUMAN: You do n't hate me .
NELLE: Not much . What ? Marie Dewey ? We 've got somewhere to go for Thanksgiving supper .
TRUMAN: Apparently Detective Foxy 's wife has a better opinion of me than Detective Foxy .
MARIE: You came .
NELLE: Hi .
TRUMAN: Thank you for having us .
MARIE: Thank you . Get yourselves in here . Alvin ! Get your pants on . They 're here . On Nelle and Truman , surprised .
TRUMAN: More . More .
MARIE: Alvin will hate this .
TRUMAN: Yes , but we who know the truth will love it .
MARIE: I have to stop . I can not believe you 're from New Orleans . I miss it so much .
TRUMAN: I only lived there for a short while ut my Mama was born and bred .
MARIE: You know something Alvin pretends he does n't know who you are , but the minute you came to town he read you ooks . He had one of his men pick up `` Breakfast at Tiffany 's '' in Kansas City 'cause it 's banned from the library here .
TRUMAN: What did Mr. Dewey think ?
MARIE: He liked it more than he 's willing to admit .
TRUMAN: How very foxy .
MARIE: Alright , one more shake .
TRUMAN: Hello .
NELLE: Hi . Silence . Marie sips her drink .
MARIE: How you doing , foxy ? She cracks up .
TRUMAN: I was writing the script as they were filming , all that time in Italy . I 'd work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day 's scenes . Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar
MARIE: Humphrey Bogart . Alvin knows .
TRUMAN: where he and John drank every night
MARIE: John Huston . Alvin knows .
TRUMAN: and I mean drank , like famished water buffaloes . Well I 'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me I had a phone call . It was my stepfather , Joe Capote , calling to say that my mother had died . I flew home to New York terribly distraught but when I got to the apartment I could see that Joe was in even worse shape than I was . He grabbed my hands and sat me down at the kitchen table , and he said to me , `` Talk . Talk about anything , any subject in the world . Do n't worry whether it will interest me or not . Just talk so I wo n't break down . '' And I did . He could n't bea to be alone with his thoughts . It was too painful .
MARIE: It 's been a hard couple weeks fo Alvin . He and Herb Clutter were good friends . From church .
DEWEY: Marie
MARIE: Oh come on , Alvin . These are good people . Finally , Dewey looks at Truman and Nelle .
TRUMAN: Who would put a pillow under the oy 's head just to shoot him ? Why would they tuck Nancy in ?
DEWEY: I want to know the same thing .
NELLE: Twisted notion of tenderness .
MARIE: So many of my friends would love to meet you .
NELLE: That 'd be fine
TRUMAN: You do n't have to worry . I 'm not going to write about this until everything 's over .
DEWEY: I 'm not worried . I know what room you 're in at the hotel . And I know where you live in Brooklyn . Truman smiles .
HOLT: I 'd of picked them up but I have n't een myself . Mind you , I make the walk out here every day , check the house , make sure the pipes do n't freeze that sort of item . The least I can do for Mr. Clutter .
NELLE: How long have you worked here ?
HOLT: 1940 a lotta years . The wife too , cleaning the house . Cooking .
NELLE: Well , she 's marvelous . Lunch was wonderful .
HOLT: She had a hard job after what all happened . Cleaning . I burned most of the rest mattresses too far of a mess . I 've asked around some if anyone 's looking for a strong hand .
JACK: You 're celebrating .
TRUMAN: Remember Nelle 's manuscript she sent me in New York ?
JACK: Mockingbird . Killing a Mockingbird . You said it was good .
TRUMAN: And I was right . She just heard Lipincott wants to publish it .
JACK: Well . Jesus . That 's terrific . Tell her congratulations .
TRUMAN: Congratulations . Jealous .
JACK: Just promise you 'll be home by Christmas .
TRUMAN: I ca n't leave now Jack I mean it was hard at first , but now I 'm practically the mayor . He vamps . Nelle laughs .
JACK: Alright .
TRUMAN: I want to come home I do . Though if they catch whoever did this , who knows what I 'll probably be here til next Christmas .
JACK: Right . I 'll let you go .
TRUMAN: Jack , we 'll go away this spring to write . Maybe Spain
JACK: Alright , Truman .
TRUMAN: Bye . The poor boy misses me . Goes to the mini-bar to fix a drink .
NELLE: Truman .
TRUMAN: Nelle .
NELLE: You remember when we were kids ?
TRUMAN: I was never a kid . I was born fully formed .
NELLE: I had no idea what a homosexual was . But I knew whatever they were , you were one of 'em .
TRUMAN: girdle up no extra bulges if you 're dressed right for him when he gets home , the evening should be smooth sailing . Bon voyage , gals .
MARIE: I ca n't believe you got this whole page I only read it to you once !
TRUMAN: I 've trained myself .
NELLE: trained myself . Truman looks at Nelle .
TRUMAN: I have 94 percent ecall .
NELLE: 94 percent recall .
TRUMAN: You cut that out .
MARIE: You believe that Alvin ?
ALVIN: Impressive . He walks out . Silence .
MARIE: I 'm sorry . He 's upset . smoking three packs a day . Two men did it . They know who . One of them used to have a cellmate who gave him up for the thousand dolla eward . They passed through Kansas City last week writing bad checks y the time Alvin 's boys got up there they 'd skipped out again .
NELLE: Where to ?
MARIE: They have no idea .
DEWEY: Alvin . Paul . Now .
MARIE: Alvin Phone RINGS .
DEWEY: Sit . Alvin Jr. enters .
MARIE: Tell them we 're at dinner , Alvin .
DEWEY: Not now , Alvin .
NELLE: Hey .
MARIE: Motorcycle accident . He broke them and they never healed right . Alvin told me .
DOROTHY: Truman Capote .
TRUMAN: Dorothy Sanderson . I figured you 'd e left alone this morning by that hard-working husband of yours . So I have breakfast . I have news . And I have literature . My friend Jack mailed me the book you wanted .
DOROTHY: `` For the maiden of the Midwest , the priestess of the plains , the queen of the kitchen my first novel . Truman . ''
TRUMAN: They put you in the women 's cell .
PERRY: Among other indignities .
TRUMAN: Well she 's a good cook .
PERRY: She 's scared of me .
TRUMAN: I think so am I . A little bit .
PERRY: Are you ? You have any aspirin ? My legs Dorothy 's in the doorway .
DOROTHY: Um . Truman ? All set . Truman looks at Dorothy , looks back at Perry .
TRUMAN: I 'm sorry .
JUDGE TATE: In the matter of the State of Kansas v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith this Court has been informed by counsel Mr . Weeks that defendants wish to waive thei ight to Preliminary Hearing . Mr. Hickock , is that your wish ?
HICKOCK: Yessir . Yes . Hickock sits . Truman whispers to Nelle
TRUMAN: Why are they doing that ?
JUDGE TATE: Mr. Smith .
PERRY: I ask that the waiver be effectuated . Judge Tate looks at him for a moment
JUDGE TATE: So noted . We 're adjourned .
DOROTHY: Mr. Capote .
TRUMAN: Madame Sanderson .
DOROTHY: Is that for the two of us to share ? Or for me to eat alone while you talk to our guest ? Truman is caught . He smiles .
TRUMAN: Was it your choice to waive the hearing ?
PERRY: I could kill you if you got too close .
TRUMAN: Would you like some water ? Perry shakes his head . Silence .
PERRY: He said we 'd curry favor with the Judge if we waived our rights .
TRUMAN: Who did ?
PERRY: The lawyer .
TRUMAN: Okay .
PERRY: Your picture 's undignified . People ecall first impressions .
TRUMAN: What 's been your first impression ?
PERRY: You want something .
TRUMAN: From you ?
DOROTHY: Truman . Walter 's gon na be home soon .
TRUMAN: I just want permission to talk . Has anyone else visited ? Perry does n't answer .
DOROTHY: Truman
TRUMAN: Will you tell me if you need anything ? I can have whatever you want sent from New York . Will you do that ?
SHAWN: William Shawn .
TRUMAN: I 'm writing a book . It 's too much for a single article this town , the killers most of all you will e stunned by Perry Smith
SHAWN: Why ? What has he
TRUMAN: Not much yet , but I know . I can sense him . He 's desperately lonely , frightened I have questions are you ready ?
SHAWN: Would it matter
TRUMAN: How much more money can you send me ? How quickly can you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures ?
HICKOCK: Perry , honey . You look terrific
TRUMAN: I have the perfect place for it , over the hearth .
NELLE: Where 'd Perry get the art set ?
JUDGE TATE: Members of the jury . Have you reached a verdict ?
FOREMAN: Yes sir .
JUDGE TATE: Defendants rise .
FOREMAN: We have , your honor .
JUDGE TATE: What is your verdict ?
FOREMAN: Guilty . On all counts .
JUDGE TATE: Have you unanimously reached a sentence .
FOREMAN: We have , your honor .
JUDGE TATE: What is the sentence ?
FOREMAN: Death .
JUDGE TATE: Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene Hickock . You 've been found guilty of four counts of murder in the first degree . You will be taken to the state penitentiary at Lansing . No later than midnight , May 13 of this year , nineteen hundred and sixty , each of you will be hanged by the neck until dead . So ordered .
HICKOCK: Alright , partner . Least now we 're not the only killers in Kansas . Perry looks at him , utterly lost . FLASH .
TRUMAN: You think he slept at all ? Nelle looks over at him .
BEN BARON: Nelle . Kudos on `` Kill the Bird . '' Is that it ?
NELLE: Close enough . Thanks . William Shawn talks to a MUCH TALLER WOMAN .
SHAWN: He has n't written a word yet , though he says it 's the nonfiction book of the decade We HEAR Truman before we see him
TRUMAN: He 's as short as I am . And almost as pretty . I 'd be with him right now ut he 's being given new accommodations Guests laugh .
JACK: Watch out . This is the start of a great love affair .
NELLE: Oh yes . Truman in love with Truman .
TRUMAN: I was in Marilyn 's apartment just last week . I had to break it to he that , of the four Matisses hanging on her wall , two were upside down .
REPORTER: You have a subject ?
TRUMAN: On the night of November 14 , two men oke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family . Why did they do that ? It 's been suggested that this subject is tawdry it 's not worthy of literature . I disagree . Two worlds exist in this country the quiet conservative life , and the life of those two men the underbelly , the criminally violent . Those worlds converged that bloody night . I spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence . I spent hours talking to the killers and I 'll spend more . Researching this work has changed my life , altered my point of view about almost everything . I think those who ead it will be similarly affected . Such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction
REPORTER: You 're speaking of yourself .
TRUMAN: You 're really very clever .
JACK: So you find them a new lawyer .
TRUMAN: They 're facing execution in six weeks , Jack . They need someone to argue whether or not that 's right .
JACK: Okay .
TRUMAN: I 'd also like to see them alive , yes , thank you very much . I need to hear their story . They walk in silence for a few moments .
JACK: Just be careful what you do to get what you want .
TRUMAN: I 'm finding them a lawyer .
JACK: Truman . You 're finding yourself a lawyer .
KRUTCH: We do well by our boys . Showers once a week . Feed em good . We 'll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he do n't eat . Get the food in through his arm .
TRUMAN: What are you talking about ?
KRUTCH: Has n't eaten in a month . But it 's not his right to kill himself . It 's the People 's right . The People of this State . And that 's who I work for , the People . You can write any of this down .
TRUMAN: No one told me .
KRUTCH: Yah . Wo n't eat .
TRUMAN: When can I see him ?
KRUTCH: How about you come back Thursday ?
TRUMAN: No . That 's no good . I need to see them now , then whenever I want fo as long as I want .
KRUTCH: Not how we do things here . Pause .
TRUMAN: I see .
KRUTCH: I did n't know where to count you oy being half-Indian . I did him a favor though . Counted him White .
TRUMAN: You 're a kind and generous man .
HICKOCK: My hero .
TRUMAN: Hello .
HICKOCK: Thanks for your help with the lawyer .
TRUMAN: That 's fine .
HICKOCK: You must be desperate for a story to come all the way out here .
TRUMAN: Thank you . Truman walks to the next cell .
HICKOCK: Ask me , he 's just trying to prove the insanity defense .
TRUMAN: I do n't care what your plans are fo yourself
PERRY: Before she had us . Before she started drinking .
TRUMAN: Who took care of you as a child ?
PERRY: Orphanage . Me and Linda .
TRUMAN: That 's your sister ?
PERRY: Who raised you up ?
TRUMAN: My Aunts . That 's when I met Nelle she lived next door . Your mother was Indian ?
PERRY: Cherokee .
TRUMAN: Drinking was not a good thing fo her .
PERRY: No tolerance for it .
TRUMAN: And your father ?
PERRY: No tolerance for him either .
TRUMAN: What I ca n't decide is if you understand how fascinating you are . Perry does n't respond , then
PERRY: I 'm sorry about your tie . They took it away from me because we 're all on suicide watch . It 's why the lights stay on at night .
TRUMAN: I hope we 're past that now . You had me worried .
PERRY: Okay .
TRUMAN: I do n't care about the tie . It 's just a pity because it looked so good on you .
PERRY: Be careful of Ricardo . I think he wants you all to himself .
TRUMAN: Alright
PERRY: But he 's naturally mendacious not to be trusted if he had a hundred dollars he 'd steal a stick of chewing gum .
TRUMAN: You would n't .
PERRY: I tracked my father down in Alaska . I was 14 . One day I said to him , `` Mom 's dead . '' I could see it . A week later we got the news . She finally drunk herself to death .
TRUMAN: This is remarkable .
PERRY: Sometimes you see a thing how it eally is .
TRUMAN: He trusts me that 's why he gave it to me . He 's given me absolutely everything . You should see his drawings , Nelle , how good he is . He wants so badly to e taken seriously , to be held in some esteem .
NELLE: Do you ?
TRUMAN: Do I what ?
NELLE: Hold him in esteem ?
TRUMAN: Well he 's a gold mine . I mean he 's told me his entire life , and now it 's all here for me to write down All of the history I need . His entire life in this Diary . His dead mother . A brother and siste killed themselves .
NELLE: You tell him your mama did the same thing ?
TRUMAN: I tell him everything . We 've been talking our heads off the past month . Sometimes , when I think how good my ook can be , I can hardly breathe .
NELLE: Huh .
TRUMAN: Here 's what I wanted to read to you `` If Called Upon to Make a Speech `` this is exactly what I was talking about a speech just in case he 's ever recognized for an achievement `` If Called Upon to Make a Speech I ca n't remember what I was going to say for the life of me . I do n't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very , very glad . It 's a wonderful moment and a rare one . Thank you ! '' There 's an exclamation point on the end of that thank you , in case you did n't catch it Where 'd you go ? We hear Nelle exhale her cigarette .
NELLE: Christ . I guess it stopped being funny .
TRUMAN: I never said it was . Listen to this
DEWEY: Thanks . She leaves . An uncomfortable silence . Then
TRUMAN: You look good , healthy again .
DEWEY: Not a chance . Dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack .
TRUMAN: I 've decided on a title for my book . I think you 'll like it very masculine . `` In Cold Blood . ''
DEWEY: That refers to the crime or the fact that you 're still talking to the criminals ?
TRUMAN: The former , among other things .
DEWEY: I see . They eat for a moment . Then
TRUMAN: I 've been wanting to ask if you 'll let me look at your investigation notes .
DEWEY: That lawyer you helped find for you friends got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court
TRUMAN: I heard this morning .
DEWEY: on the issue of inadequate counsel .
TRUMAN: Alvin . Do you not want me to look at your notes ? You are permitted to say no .
DEWEY: I 'll tell you what if those boys get off , I 'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down .
HICKOCK: Hey , hey
PERRY: Thank you . Truman looks at the Guard he leaves .
TRUMAN: It was as much for me as for anyone . I could n't bear the thought of losing you so soon .
PERRY: We 're going to be able to use you ook for our case . You 'll write we never got to raise our insanity plea . You wrote how terrible the lawye was ?
TRUMAN: I have n't written a word yet . Beat .
PERRY: What have you been doing ?
TRUMAN: Research . Waiting to talk to you .
PERRY: All right .
TRUMAN: I had hoped
PERRY: What are you calling it ?
TRUMAN: The book ? I have no idea . Pause .
PERRY: Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor .
TRUMAN: I know a lot of people .
PERRY: You must hate having to come to this place
TRUMAN: Perry , I have invitations to be in Morocco , Greece I choose to be here . Those people have everything , all their prayers have been answered , yet they 're more desperate than ever . I prefer to be here with you .
PERRY: I was ten , I wet the bed , the nuns at the orphanage hated the smell . First month one of them found me shivering just trying to get through the night . The Sister pulled ack the covers and shined he flashlight to see what I 'd did . The sheets were wet . She hit me so many times with that flashlight she broke it . That night I dreamed about the yellow ird . Tall . Yellow like the sun . It picked me up and it clawed the Nun 's eyes and it lifted me into the sky . They look at each other .
TRUMAN: I 'm just missing this one piece , Jack . Be patient with me .
JACK: How long is that gon na take ? Why do n't you try leaving him alone fo a while ? Come to Spain . You can always visit him later .
TRUMAN: I do n't know .
JACK: Well , I 'm off . I 've got my own writing to do .
TRUMAN: Do it in Brooklyn . Wait for me .
JACK: Too many people around . I 'll leave the address on the kitchen table . Truman , what do you do there when you 're not with him ? It must e awful .
TRUMAN: I will . I will . Bye . Truman follows the YOUNG GUY into the bar .
PERRY: I did n't see you . Jesus , you Come in . Where 's the guard ?
TRUMAN: I ca n't . I brought you some things , ut I have to fly back East .
PERRY: When ?
TRUMAN: An hour . I 'm sorry .
PERRY: You ca n't .
TRUMAN: I 'm sorry .
PERRY: Who are you going there to see
TRUMAN: Your writings are magnificent . I hope these help you do more .
SHAWN: I think you need to talk to him now .
TRUMAN: And we all need to see how this ends for the final part . I ca n't finish the book till I know what happens . If Perry and Dick are executed it 's one thing and if not , well
SHAWN: Truman . You got your ending
TRUMAN: I really do n't know
SHAWN: The Kansas court denied their appeal . It came over the wire on Friday . You need to talk to Perry now . He 'll be dead by September . I 'm sorry , I know how much you 've come to care about him . Truman is completely immobile .
TRUMAN: Right . Yes . Right .
SHAWN: I want to set up a reading for you in the fall , in New York . We 'll build some interest , and we 'll publish in the fall . On Truman .
TRUMAN: Plums . Thank god . We have nothing in the house .
JACK: I knew you could n't be depended on to stock the kitchen . Truman looks at him blankly .
TRUMAN: Oh , Jesus . I completely forgot . He helps Jack put away the groceries . Then
JACK: Plus I finished my novel yesterday . Truman looks at Jack , smiles widely .
TRUMAN: My man , my hero , my talented My man
JACK: You said that .
TRUMAN: You are the hardest worker , the most unsung talent I know . As Nelle passes y on her way to London to sell he ook which needs no selling , may a little of her success rub off on oth of us . Jack laughs .
JACK: Here , here !
NELLE: When was the last time you wrote ack to him ?
TRUMAN: I do n't know .
JACK: What 's this ?
NELLE: A letter for your boyfriend I was asked to deliver .
TRUMAN: From Perry .
JACK: Let 's have it . Jack sits . Nelle opens the letter , reads
NELLE: `` Dear Friend Truman . Where are you ? Read this item in a medical dictionary `` Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia , by fracture of the cervical vertebrae , by laceration of the trachea . '' Not too comforting as we lost our appeal . Missing you alone and desirous of your presence . Your amigo , Perry . '' Pause .
TRUMAN: Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday .
JACK: I was wondering why you were in such a good mood . Surely , I thought , it 's not because I finished my little ook .
TRUMAN: That 's a terrible thing to say . Jack looks out at the ocean .
NELLE: Did you ? Fall in love with him . Silence as they load the bags into the trunk .
TRUMAN: I do n't know how to answer that It 's as if Perry and I started life in the same house . One day he stood up and walked out the back door while I walked out the front . With some different choices , he 's the man I might have become .
NELLE: Are you kidding me ?
TRUMAN: I 'll see you at the reading in New York .
NELLE: The sixteenth .
TRUMAN: Ca n't it be both ?
NELLE: No . I do n't think it can be .
PERRY: What was he in jail for ?
TRUMAN: They said it was not paying his taxes . But really for being an outsider efusing to go along . Perry nods , looks at the other books .
ROW GUARD: Lock-down while Lowell goes to solitary . Nobody in or out . You want in or out ?
TRUMAN: In .
PERRY: Everyone says he 's a genius . I do n't think he 's a genius . He 's rich and he went to college like any of us would 've if we got the chance . He came home for Christmas and shot his parents
TRUMAN: in front of the television .
PERRY: You remember the story
TRUMAN: They were watching Father Knows Best . They look at each other and smile . Then
PERRY: I wo n't be sorry to see him go . Always correcting my grammar .
TRUMAN: I 'm so sorry I 've been away .
PERRY: It was a long time .
TRUMAN: I know .
PERRY: I wish you could come next week , when they take him out to the Corner , ut the whole prison shuts down .
TRUMAN: I have to be in New York anyway . Perry nods .
PERRY: How 's the book going ?
TRUMAN: Very slowly .
PERRY: Will you show it to me ?
TRUMAN: I 've hardly written anything .
GUARD #1: Ready .
HICKOCK: Keep your head high , buddy .
ANDREWS: Alright now .
HICKOCK: or they wo n't be able to rope you under your fat fucking chin .
ANDREWS: Next !
BEN BARON: Hello Hollywood . That 's quite a bundle you sold your book for .
NELLE: Well
YOUNG ASSISTANT: Mr. Capote . Can I get you anything ?
TRUMAN: No . Thank you .
LITERARY ENTHUSIAST: Your portrait of those men was terrifying . Terrifying .
TRUMAN: Thank you . Truman and Isherwood watch him walk away .
ISHERWOOD: Your hairpiece is terrifying .
TRUMAN: I was going to say the same thing !
SHAWN: Everyone was there .
TRUMAN: Tennessee loved it .
SHAWN: Of course he did .
TRUMAN: Should we do more ? I was terrified , ut
SHAWN: No , Now we get to withhold while everyone else talks . Let them do the work .
TRUMAN: I think so . You know they 're scheduled for next month ?
SHAWN: Hanging . Yes . I 'll commit as many issues as it takes to publish . Three . As many as it takes .
TRUMAN: I 'm flying to Kansas tomorrow . I 'll get Perry to talk
SHAWN: Honestly , what 's he got to lose ?
TRUMAN: It really is too awful . Institutionalized sadism . Shawn nods .
SHAWN: You 'll be able to finish now .
TRUMAN: As strange as it may sound to you , I 'm going to miss him .
PERRY: Two days ago .
TRUMAN: Perry , sit down . For a minute . I need you to talk to me
PERRY: We 've got all the time in the world to talk . About everything . I 've been thinking about Ricardo . You need to stop sending him those trashy books . I wo n't even mention the pornography . I realize he might have trouble grasping the literature you gave me , ut those books only exacerbate the problem only 'heighten ' o 'intensify ' it . Maybe we should start him on a program
TRUMAN: Perry .
PERRY: Give him the simple novels first
TRUMAN: Perry . Perry stops .
PERRY: Okay . I thought in case
TRUMAN: There is not a word , or a sentence , or a concept , that you can illuminate for me . There is one singular reason that I keep coming here
PERRY: Truman
TRUMAN: November 14th , 1959 . Three years ago . Three years . That 's all I want to hear from you . Pause .
PERRY: I 've asked you not to
TRUMAN: This is ridiculous . I 'm ready . I have a plane to catch . I found your sister in Tacoma . Maybe she 'll talk to me about something useful .
PERRY: Do n't go out there . The Guard lets Truman out of the cell .
TRUMAN: This is my work , Perry . I 'm working . When you want to tell me what I need to hear , you let me know .
MRS. MURCHAK: They 'll play outside a while longer .
TRUMAN: They 've never seen these pictures ?
MRS. MURCHAK: Too many questions . She joins Truman again at the table .
TRUMAN: I do n't think life works that way .
MRS. MURCHAK: It does in this family .
TRUMAN: When was the last time you saw him ?
MRS. MURCHAK: Ten years . She picks up the album to put it away .
TRUMAN: Do you think I could borrow one of those pictures ?
MRS. MURCHAK: Take the whole thing . I do n't want'em anymore . Just Perry does n't know where I live . He thinks we 're still in Portland . Please do n't tell him we 're not .
TRUMAN: Alright .
MRS. MURCHAK: Do n't be taken in by my brother . He 's got this sensitive side he 'll show . You believe he 's gentle , so easily hurt . But he 'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand . I believe that .
TRUMAN: Hello handsome .
ROW GUARD: You want to go in ? Truman regards Perry for a few moments , then
TRUMAN: Yes
PERRY: What 's the name of your book ?
TRUMAN: I do n't
PERRY: What 's the name of your book ?
TRUMAN: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
PERRY: `` Truman Capote read last night before a packed audience from his non-fiction ook IN COLD BLOOD . '' He looks at Truman .
TRUMAN: Who sent that to you ? Perry does n't answer .
PERRY: That 's not your goddamn business .
TRUMAN: It is my business , because it 's not true . The organizers of the reading needed a title . They picked one a sensational one , I admit to attract a crowd .
PERRY: They picked it .
TRUMAN: Yes .
PERRY: That 's not your title .
TRUMAN: I have n't chosen one yet . Perry stares at him , not believing .
PERRY: You pretend to be my friend
TRUMAN: How could I choose a title when you still have n't told me what happened that night ? How could I ? I could n't possibly .
PERRY: Look at my belly .
PERRY: Then we drove off . Silence . Perry looks at Truman .
TRUMAN: Added up , how much money did you get from the Clutters ? Perry thinks .
PERRY: Between forty and fifty dollars . Truman nods . They sit there for a long time .
TRUMAN: Jack .
JACK: I do n't know how you can eat that . Perhaps if you were n't drinking so much you would n't have to .
TRUMAN: Put it with the others .
JACK: You tried ?
TRUMAN: Nelle .
NELLE: I thought I 'd find you here .
TRUMAN: Please , another .
NELLE: How are you ?
TRUMAN: Terrible . Beat .
NELLE: I 'm sorry to hear that .
TRUMAN: Well . It 's torture . Torture what they 're doing to me .
NELLE: Uh-huh .
TRUMAN: Now the Supreme Court . Can you believe it ? If they win this appeal I will have a complete nervous breakdown . I may never recover . Just pray things turn my way .
NELLE: It must be hard .
TRUMAN: It 's torture . They 're torturing me .
NELLE: I see . Nelle regards him for a moment .
TRUMAN: I frankly do n't know what the fuss is about . On Truman , alone at the bar .
OPERATOR: I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the Kansas Correctional System . Will you accept charges ? Pause .
TRUMAN: Yes .
OPERATOR: Will you accept charges ?
TRUMAN: Oh . Uh Yes .
OPERATOR: You 'll accept charges ?
TRUMAN: Yes .
OPERATOR: Mr. Smith , you 're on the line .
PERRY: Hello ? I ca n't This does n't seem Operator , I do n't think you put me
TRUMAN: I 'm here . Beat .
PERRY: Truman .
TRUMAN: Hello , Perry .
PERRY: They let me make a couple phone calls efore I go down to Holding You heard the Supreme Court rejected the appeal .
TRUMAN: I did n't I had n't heard that .
PERRY: Yeah . Pause .
TRUMAN: I 'm sorry .
PERRY: Yeah . They let me make two phone calls . Truman does n't know what to say .
TRUMAN: I do n't know if I can . I 'll try . I do n't know if I can .
PERRY: Please visit me , Truman . Just
GUARD: Ready .
KRUTCH: Perry .
PERRY: Truman Capote .
KRUTCH: Anybody else ? Perry SHAKES HIS HEAD .
SHAWN: You want anything ? Truman shakes his head .
PERRY: Thank you . You sent the telegram to his hotel ?
GUARD: Hours ago .
PERRY: May I make a phone call ?
SHAWN: That 's him again . Truman is immobile . Phone still rings .
KRUTCH: You got a telex . Perry nods . Krutch reads
PERRY: It 's not true , is it ?
NELLE: Would you put him on please ?
SHAWN: He wo n't talk .
NELLE: Mr. Shawn , if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear , I need to speak to him .
SHAWN: It 's Nelle .
KRUTCH: I did n't think I 'd be seeing you again . You can visit for a few minutes . Truman stands , turns to Shawn , still seated .
SHAWN: No .
TRUMAN: Come with me .
SHAWN: Truman . No . Truman goes alone .
KRUTCH: Five minutes .
HICKOCK: He returns . Long time .
TRUMAN: I do n't know what you must think of me .
HICKOCK: You have n't been foremost on my mind lately . As you can imagine .
PERRY: You got the letter ?
TRUMAN: Yes .
PERRY: It 's true . I mean I understand why you did n't want to come . I would n't e here either if I did n't have to .
HICKOCK: You got that right . Silence .
PERRY: You know Ricardo donated his eyes to science ? Next week , some blind man will be seeing what Dick used to see .
HICKOCK: He 'd be better off the way he was . What I 've seen has n't been so nice to look at but I guess it 's bette than nothing . They came around with a form . Hey . You 'll be walking down the street one day in Denver , wherever and suddenly these eyes will be staring at you . Would n't that be something ?
TRUMAN: It would be . Krutch opens the door .
KRUTCH: Time .
PERRY: You 'll be watching ?
TRUMAN: I do n't know . Do you want me to ?
PERRY: I 'd like to have a friend there .
TRUMAN: Okay . Then I will . Truman looks down , starts to cry .
PERRY: It 's alright .
TRUMAN: I did everything I could .
PERRY: Okay .
TRUMAN: I truly did .
PERRY: I know . Truman nods , wipes his eyes .
TRUMAN: Goodbye , Perry .
PERRY: You 're not rid of me yet . I 'll see you in a few minutes . Truman goes . On Perry watching him leave .
KRUTCH: Perry Edward Smith . `` For the crime of murder in the first degree , by order of the Court of Finney County and the Supreme Court of the sovereign State of Kansas , you are sentenced to hang until you die . '' You can say something if you want .
PERRY: Is there anybody from the family here ?
KRUTCH: No . Perry is disappointed by this information .
PERRY: Well . Tell them I ca n't remember what I was going to say for the life of me He stops . Several moments .
CHAPLAIN: Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for thou art with me .
NELLE: Hello .
TRUMAN: Someday I 'll tell you about it . Fo the moment , I 'm too shattered . Pause .
NELLE: They 're dead , Truman . You 're alive .
TRUMAN: It was a terrible experience and I will never get over it . There was n't anything I could have done to save them . We hear Nelle light a cigarette .
NELLE: Maybe not . We hear her exhale slowly .
SHAWN: It came to the hotel this morning . I told them I 'd give it to you .
PERRY: Life is only the father of wisdom . Death is the mother .
STELLA: Hiya , Carrie . Gee you gave me a fright . How long have you been there ?
CARRIE: What are those ?
STELLA: Those are my breasts , honey .
CARRIE: I wish I had some .

PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Too many cars here . Out of my way !
FINN: Professor Zundapp ?
NOSY PACER: You wanted to see this before we load it ?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Ah , yes . Very carefully
NOSY PACER: Oh . A TV camera . What does it actually do ?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: This camera is extremely dangerous .
FINN: What are you up to now , Professor ?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: This is valuable equipment . Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage .
NOSY PACER: You got it . Finn LOWERS HIMSELF . He snaps more pictures .
GREM: This is one of those British spies we told you about .
ACER: Yeah . This one we caught sticking his bumper where it did n't belong .
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Agent Leland Turbo .
GREM: Get to the boats .
ACER: He 's getting away !
COMBAT SHIP: Not for long .
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Wunderbar . With Finn McMissile gone , who can stop us now ?
MATER: Mater . Tow Mater , that 's who is here to help you !
OTIS: Hey , Mater . Gosh , I 'm so sorry . I thought I could make it this time , ut Smooth like pudding , huh ? Ah , who am I kidding ? I 'll always be a lemon . Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him .
MATER: Well dadgum , you 're leaking oil again . Must be your gaskets . Hey , look on the bright side This is your tenth tow this month , so that means it 's on the house .
OTIS: You 're the only one that 's nice to lemons like me , Mater .
MATER: Do n't sweat it . These things happen to everybody , Otis .
OTIS: But you never leak oil .
MATER: Yeah , but I ai n't perfect . Do n't tell nobody , but I think my rust is starting to show through .
OTIS: Hey , is Lightning McQueen back yet ?
MATER: Not yet .
OTIS: He must be crazy-excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup . Four ! Wow !
MATER: Yeah , we 're so dadgum proud of him . But I sure wish he 'd hurry up and get back ` cause we got a whole summer 's worth of best friend fun to make up for . Just me and
OTIS: Uh , Mater ? I 'm in no hurry . You do n't need to go so fast ! Boom ! They hit a bump . Otis catches air .

MATER: McQueen !
OTIS: Woaahhhhh ! - right through Ramone 's front door -
RAMONE: Hey . How far 'd you make it this time , Otis ?
OTIS: Halfway to the county line .
RAMONE: Not bad , man .
OTIS: I know , I ca n't believe it either !
MATER: McQueen , welcome back !
MCQUEEN: Mater , it 's so good to see you .
MATER: You too , buddy .
MACK: These best friend greetings get longer every year .
MATER: You ready to have some serious fun ?
MCQUEEN: Well , actually I 've got something to show you first .
MATER: Wow . I ca n't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson .
MCQUEEN: I know Doc said these things were just old cups , but to have someone else win it just did n't feel right , you know ?
MATER: Well , Doc would 've been real proud of you . That 's for sure . McQueen takes this in .
MCQUEEN: Alright , pal . I 've been waiting all summer for this . What 've you got planned ?
MATER: You sure you can handle it ?
MCQUEEN: Come on , you know who you 're talking to ? This is Lightning McQueen . I can handle anything .

MCQUEEN: Mater , I meant it would be just me and Sally .
MATER: Oh .
MCQUEEN: It 's just for tonight . We 'll do whatever you want tomorrow .
MATER: Okay .
MCQUEEN: Thanks for understanding .
MATER: Yeah , sure . Y'all go on and have fun now .
MCQUEEN: Alright , then . See ya soon , amigo ! McQueen drives off . Mater watches him go .
SALLY: This is so nice .
MCQUEEN: I ca n't tell you how good it is to e here alone . Just the two of us . Finally , you and me -
MATER: My name is Mater and I 'll be you waiter .
TO HIMSELF: Mater the waiter . That 's funny ight there .
MCQUEEN: Mater , you work here ?
MATER: Well yeah I work here . What 'd you think , I just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to e your waiter , just so I could hang out with you ? McQueen and Sally exchange a look .
MCQUEEN: Oh , yeah . How ridiculous would that e ?
MATER: Now , can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks ?
MCQUEEN: Yes . I 'll have my usual .
SALLY: You know what ? I 'm going to have that too . Mater blinks .
MATER: Uh , right . Your usual .

SARGE: Uh-oh
MCQUEEN: Hey , what 's going on over there ?
SALLY: Francesco Bernoulli . No wonde there 's a crowd .
MCQUEEN: Wait , why do you know his name ? And do n't say it like that . It 's three syllables , not ten .
SALLY: What ? He 's nice to look at . You know , open-wheeled and all .
MCQUEEN: What 's wrong with fenders ? I thought you like my fenders .
MATER: Ha ha ! That shows what you know . Dump trucks is dumb .
MCQUEEN: Those are strong words from a ca that is so fragile .
GUIDO: Pit stop . McQueen turns back to the phone .
MCQUEEN: You know what ? They just got back . Deal me in , baby . Ka-chow ! The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS .
SALLY: Oh , no , do n't worry about me . I 've got enough to do here . Mater 's going to have a blast though . You 're bringing Mater , right ? You never bring him to any of you aces .
MATER: Your drinks , sir .
MCQUEEN: Mater .

JEFF GORVETTE: Check out that tow truck .

MCQUEEN: Will you guys excuse me just fo one little second ?
MATER: You 're just realizing that ? Boy , that jet-lag really done a numbe on you .

MCQUEEN: Nice to meet you , Francesco .
FRANCESCO: Yeah , nice to meet you too . You are very good-looking . Not as good as I thought , but you 're good .
MATER: Excuse me . Can I get a picture with you ?
FRANCESCO: Anything for McQueen 's friend . As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco
MATER: Miss Sally is gon na flip when she sees this . She 's Lightning McQueen 's girlfriend .
FRANCESCO: Oooh .
MATER: She 's a big fan of yours .
FRANCESCO: Hey , she has good taste .
MCQUEEN: Mater 's prone to exaggeration . I would n't say she 's a `` big '' fan .
MATER: You 're right . She 's a huge fan . She goes on and on about your open wheels here .
MCQUEEN: Mentioning it once does n't qualify as going `` on and on . ''
FRANCESCO: Francesco is familiar with this eaction to Francesco . Women espect a car that has nothing to hide .
MCQUEEN: Yeah , uh
FRANCESCO: Let us have a toast .
MCQUEEN: Let 's .
FRANCESCO: I dedicate my win tomorrow to Miss Sally .
MCQUEEN: Oh , sorry . I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her . So if we both do it , it 's really not so special . Besides , I do n't have a drink .
MATER: I 'll go get you one . You mind if I orrow a few bucks for one of them drinks ?
MCQUEEN: They 're free , Mater .
MATER: Free ? Well , shoot , what am I doing here ? Mater ZIPS OFF .
MCQUEEN: I should probably go keep an eye on him . See you at the race . McQueen starts to leave .
FRANCESCO: Yes , you will see Francesco . But not like this .
MCQUEEN: That 's cute . So you had one of those made up for all the racers ?
FRANCESCO: No .
MCQUEEN: Okay . He rolls off .
VOICE: Ladies and gentlecars Sir Miles Axlerod !
MILES AXLEROD: It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first-ever World Grand Prix . From Brazil . Number eight
HOLLEY: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no adiator .
FINN: That 's because it 's air-cooled .
HOLLEY: I 'm Agent Shiftwell , Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station . I have a message from London .
FINN: Not here .
LOUDLY: You must try the canapes on the mezzanine !
FINN: So the lab boys analyzed the photo I sent ? What did they learn about the camera ?
HOLLEY: It appears to be a standard television camera . They said if you could get closer photos next time , that would be great .
FINN: This was London 's message ?
HOLLEY: Oh no , no . No sir . Um , the oil platforms you were on ? Turns out they 're sitting on the biggest oil eserve in the world .
FINN: How did we miss that ?
HOLLEY: They 'd been scrambling everyone 's satellites . The Americans actually discovered it just before you did . They placed an agent on that platform , under deep cover . He was able to get a photo of the ca who 's running the entire operation .
FINN: Who is it ? Has anyone seen the photo yet ?
HOLLEY: No , not yet . The American is here tonight to pass it to you . He 'll signal you when he 's ready .
FINN: GOOD -
HOLLEY: What is it ?
FINN: Change of plan . You 're meeting the American .
HOLLEY: What , me ?
FINN: Those thugs down there were on the oil platform . If they see me , the whole mission is compromised .
HOLLEY: No , no . I 'm technical , you see . I 'm in Diagnostics . I 'm not a field agent .
FINN: You are now .
MATER: I 'll take one of them .
SUSHI CHEF: No , no . Wasabi .
MATER: Oh , same ol ' , same ol ' . What 's up with you ? That looks delicious .
SUSHI CHEF: My condolences .
MILES AXLEROD: and now , our last competitor - Number 95 , Lightning McQueen !
MCQUEEN: Thank you so much for having us , Sir Axlerod . I really look forward to racing . This is a great opportunity .
MILES AXLEROD: Oh , the pleasure is all ours , Lightning . You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition .
MATER: Somebody get me water !
MCQUEEN: Sir Axlerod , I can explain . This is Mater .
MILES AXLEROD: I know him . This is the bloke that called into the television show .
TO MATER: You 're the one I have to thank .
MATER: No , thank you . This trip 's been amazing .
MILES AXLEROD: He 's a little excited , is n't he ?
MCQUEEN: Mater !
MATER: But wait , I oh , shoot .
MCQUEEN: Mater , you have to get a hold of yourself . You 're making a scene .
MATER: But I never leak oil . Never .
MCQUEEN: Go take care of yourself right now . Mater drives off .
MATER: Coming through ! Excuse me , leakin ' oil . Where 's the bathroom ? Thank you . I got ta go !
ROD REDLINE: Okay , McMissile . I 'm here . It 's time for the drop .
HOLLEY: Oh , you 've got to be joking .
FINN: What 's the problem , Shiftwell ?
HOLLEY: He 's in the loo .
FINN: So go in !
HOLLEY: I ca n't just go into the men 's loo .
FINN: Time is of the essence , Shiftwell .
MATER: Whatever you do , I would not go in there .
ROD REDLINE: I 'm fine .
GREM: Hey . Tow truck . Mater turns back to Grem and Acer .
MATER: Oh , yeah . Do n't let me get in the way of your `` private business . '' Oh ! A little advice When you hea her giggle and see that waterfall , you best press that green button .
GREM: Thank you .
MATER: It 's to adjust the temperature .
ACER: Got it .
MATER: Remember it 's in Celsius , not Fahrenheit .
HOLLEY: Hello .
MATER: Well , hello .
HOLLEY: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no adiator .
MATER: Well of course it does n't . That 's ` cause it 's air-cooled !
HOLLEY: Perfect . I 'm from the Tokyo Station
MATER: Course , Karmann Ghia 's were n't the only ones . Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks , with the pancake motors
HOLLEY: Yeah . Okay , I get it-
MATER: And before both of them , there 's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore 's one of them .
HOLLEY: Listen ! We should find somewhere more private .
MATER: Uh , gee . Do n't you think that 's a little , uh -
HOLLEY: You 're right . Impossible to know which areas here are compromised . So , when can I see you again ?
MATER: Well , let 's see . Tomorrow I 'll be out there at the races .
HOLLEY: Got it . We 'll rendezvous then .
MCQUEEN: There you are . Where have you been ?
MATER: What 's a rendezvous ?
LUIGI: It 's like a date .
MATER: A date ? !
MCQUEEN: Mater , what 's going on ?
MATER: Well , what 's going on is I 've got me a date tomorrow . Guido makes a crack in Italian .
LUIGI: Guido do n't believe you .
MATER: Well , believe it . My new girlfriend just said so . Hey , there she is .
LUIGI: Guido still do n't believe you .
GREM: - you tricked us real good .
ACER: And we do n't like being tricked . Rod Redline laughs to himself .
ROD REDLINE: Well , you know , I was just wearing a disguise . You guys are stuck looking like that .
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Allinol by itself is good for you .
GREM: SMILE -
ROD REDLINE: Is that all you want ? I got a whole act .
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform . Now you will witness what it really does .
ROD REDLINE: Whatever you say , Professor .
ACER: You talked up a lot of cars last night . Which one 's your associate ?
ROD REDLINE: Your mother . Oh no , I 'm sorry . It was your sister . You know , I ca n't tell them apart these days .
GREM: Could I start it now , Professor ?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Fifty percent power . This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter .
ACER: What about her ? Did you give it to her ?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: The Allinol is now heating to a oil , dramatically expanding , causing the engine block to crack under the stress , forcing oil into the combustion chamber .
ACER: How about him ? You talk to him ?
ROD REDLINE: What do I care ? I can replace an engine block .
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: You may be able to , but after full impact of the pulse , unfortunately , there will be nothing to replace .
ACER: How about him ? Does he have it ?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: That 's him . He 's the one .
GREM: Roger that , Professor Z .
ROD REDLINE: No !
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: The project is still on schedule . You will find this second agent -
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: I 'm Brent Mustangburger , here with acing legends Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap . There 's never been a competition like this before . SHOTS OF THE PITS as the racers fuel up .
MORE: 41 .
DAVID HOBBSCAP: Really , Darrell , I think you need to clean your windshield . You 're clearly not seeing this for what it is Francesco 's race to lose .
MCQUEEN: Speed . I am speed .
FRANCESCO: Really ? You are `` speed '' ? Then Francesco is triple speed . Francesco . Is . Triple speed . Francesco likes this , McQueen . It 's eally getting him into the zone !
MCQUEEN: He is so getting beat today .
SARGE: His suspension stats look good .
LUIGI: Tire pressure is excellent .
FILLMORE: He 's got plenty of fuel .
MATER: And he 's awesome !
HOLLEY: Why is he in the pits ? He 's so exposed .
FINN: It 's his cover . One of the best I 've seen , too . Look at the detail on that rust . It must have cost him a fortune .
HOLLEY: But why has n't he contacted us yet ?
FINN: There 's probably heat on him . Be patient .
HOLLEY: Right , of course . He 'll signal us when he can .
FINN: And then we find out who 's behind all this .
MATER: McQueen ! It 's time to make you move . Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you .
MCQUEEN: Nice call , Mater . Keep it up !
GREM: Roger that .
ACER: What is it ?
GREM: It 's that tow truck from the athroom .
ACER: The one from the bathroom ?
GREM: Yeah , the one the American Agent passed the device to .
ACER: What about him ?
GREM: What about him ? He 's in the pits !
ACER: Not for long . Acer exits , with purpose .
HOLLEY: Hold on . I think I 've got something .
FINN: What is it ?
HOLLEY: The Pacer from the party last night . She 's spotted Acer , moving swiftly forward .
FINN: Anyone with him ? He wo n't be alone .
HOLLEY: Conducting analysis on the target .
MATER: Wow ! Some of them fellers is really loud .
MCQUEEN: Guys , a little too much chatter . Let 's keep this line clear .
MATER: Is there gon na be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the ace ?
HOLLEY: I 'm trying .
TO MATER: Get out now ! We CUT BACK TO - - MATER . He gives in , exits the pit .
MATER: Well , all right but I usually like to have a proper detailing done efore I meet a lady friend .
ACER: Finn McMissile ? But you 're dead !
FINN: Then this should n't hurt at all .
HOLLEY: I 've got him in the back alleys east of the garages . Multiple assailants are closing in quickly .
MATER: Hey , new lady friend ? You like flowers ?
MCQUEEN: What ? ON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop .
MATER: Stay outside . Gotcha .
MCQUEEN: Outside ?
FRANCESCO: Grazie and arrivaderci !
ACER: This time I 'm gon na make sure you stay dead . He hits the flame . WHOOOSSSH ! !
MATER: What 's that ? You want me to head toward that ruckus ? Mater turns INTO the alley .
MCQUEEN: Stop it , Mater . Just sign off .
MATER: That was cool ! Hey , can I get you autograph ?
DARRELL CARTRIP: Francesco , over here ! Hey , what was your strategy today ?
FRANCESCO: Strategia ? Francesco needs no strategy , it 's very simple . You start the race , wait for Lightning McQueen to choke , pass him , then win . Francesco always wins . It 's oring .
DARRELL CARTRIP: I got ta tell you , dude . You were in trouble for awhile . That dirt track section had you crawling ! As McQueen SNEAKS AWAY -
FRANCESCO: To truly crush one 's dream , you must first raise their hopes very high .
MCQUEEN: Mater .
MATER: Hey McQueen ! What happened ? Is the ace over ? You won , right ?
MCQUEEN: Mater , why were you yelling things at me while I was racing ?
MATER: Yelling ? Oh , you thought that 's funny right there . Nah , see that 's ` cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance . It was nutso . One of them even had a flamethrower -
MCQUEEN: A flamethrower ? What are you talking about ? I do n't understand . Where were you ?
MATER: Going to meet my date .
MCQUEEN: Your date ?
MATER: She started talking to me as a voice in my head , telling me where to go -
MCQUEEN: What ?
MATER: Wait a minute I did n't screw you up , did I ?
MCQUEEN: I lost the race because of you !
MATER: Well , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean -
MCQUEEN: An imaginary girlfriend , flamethrowers . This is exactly why I do n't bring you along to these things .
MATER: Maybe if I , I do n't know , talked to somebody and explained what happened I could help .
MCQUEEN: I do n't need your help . I do n't want your help .
PRESS: - McQueen , you had it in the bag ! - Yeah , what happened ?
MCQUEEN: I made a mistake . But I can assure you , it wo n't happen again . On Mater . He takes this badly .
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the first race of the World Grand Prix and three , count em , three cars flamed out leading some to suggest that their fuel , Allinol , might be to blame .
MILES AXLEROD: Allinol is safe ! Alternative fuel is safe ! There is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out !
DARRELL CARTRIP: Well the jury may still be out on whether Allinol caused these accidents , but one thing 's fo sure Lightning McQueen blew this ace .
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: Team McQueen ca n't be happy right now .
SECURITY CAR: Come with me please , sir .
MATER: But I 'm gon na miss my plane .
SECURITY CAR: Right this way .
MATER: Doggone it . This is about my hook , is n't it ? I know I should 've checked it , but I ca n't really , look it 's attached to me .
FINN: I never properly introduced myself . Finn McMissile . British Intelligence .
MATER: Tow Mater . Average intelligence .
FINN: Who are you with ? FBI , CIA ?
MATER: Let 's just say I 'm triple-A affiliated . You know , I know some karate . I do n't wan na brag o nothing , but I 've got me a black fan belt .
FINN: You 're being followed .
MATER: This first one I can reach into a car 's hood , pull out his battery , and show it to him before he stalls . I call it , `` What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once . ''
GREM: There he is !
MATER: Look , I probably ought to go . I 'm about to miss my flight .
FINN: Do n't worry .
MATER: This is First Class service . You do n't even have to go through the terminal .
FINN: Drive forward . Whatever you do , do n't stop .
MATER: Is everything okay back there ?
FINN: Roger that .
MATER: You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what ?
FINN: Thanks , old boy !
MATER: Hey , doggone it . It 's my imaginary girlfriend !
HOLLEY: Come on ! Get in here !
MATER: Boy I tell you what , you really do want this first date , do n't ya ? That 's a no-quit attitude right there .
FINN: Hold on , Sid ! Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass .
SIDDELEY: Finn , it 's now or never !
MCQUEEN: `` I 'm so sorry for what I did . I do n't want to be the cause of you losing any more races . I want you to go prove to the world what I already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world . Your best friend , Mater . '' McQueen takes this in .
LUIGI: Wait , there 's more here .
READS: `` P.S . Please tell the hotel I did n't mean to order that movie . I thought it was just a preview and I did n't realize I was paying for it . P.P.S That 's funny right there
PP.": There 's a few more pages of P.S . 's here .
MCQUEEN: Well , at least I know if he 's at home he 'll be safe .
FINN: Now that 's how I like to start the day ! You never feel more alive than when you 're almost dead .
HOLLEY: I hope that device did n't fall off .
MATER: That 's the closest I ever been to missing my flight ! That was -
HOLLEY: Still in one piece , great .
MATER: I got ta go to a doctor . I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage .
HOLLEY: Downloading the photo now .
MATER: Hey , lem me introduce you two .
TO HOLLEY: This here is Finn McSomething-or- other . He 's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit . And Finn , this here 's my date .
HOLLEY: Oh yes , sorry . It 's Shiftwell . Holley Shiftwell .
MATER: It 's Shiftwell . Holley -
FINN: Finally . Time to see who 's behind all this .
HOLLEY: What is this ?
MATER: Well , that 's one of the worst engines ever made . It 's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts . Shoot , them Whitworth bolts is a pain , tell you what . Them ai n't metric , they ai n't inches
HOLLEY: Yes , OK , right . But who 's engine is this , Mater ?
MATER: Well , it 's kinda hard to tell from this picture , ai n't it ?
HOLLEY: But you 're the one who took it .
FINN: Holley .
HOLLEY: Oh , right . Yes , of course . `` A good agent gets what he can , then gets out before he 's killed . '' Sorry .
MATER: Agent ? You mean like insurance agent , like ,
SINGS: ` Like a good neighbor , Mater is there ' ? Wait , you mean secret agents . You guys is spies !
FINN: Holley , in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear ?
HOLLEY: It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period . At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine .
MATER: You 're pretty .
HOLLEY: Yes , alright . Thank you .
MATER: And so nice .
HOLLEY: Just pay attention .
FINN: This seems like a dead end . If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I 'd be a lot happier .
MATER: You might not be happy , but I bet this feller is . See how he 's had most of his parts replaced ? And see all them boxes over there ? Them 's all original parts . They ai n't easy to come by .
HOLLEY: Rare parts .
FINN: That 's something we can track .
HOLLEY: Exactly ! Holley drops her screen down .
FINN: Well done , Mater ! I would neve have seen that .
TO HOLLEY: I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris , a treacherous lowlife . But , he 's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is . Mater , what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one ?
MATER: Wait , what ?
FINN: You obviously have plenty of experience in the field .
MATER: Well yeah I live right next to one . I do n't know , Finn . I ai n't exactly een much help to anybody recently .
FINN: You 're helping me . Please , Mater .
MATER: Well , okay . But you know I 'm just a tow truck , right ?
FINN: Right . And I 'm just in the import/export business . Siddeley ?
SIDDELEY: Yes , Finn ?
FINN: Paris . Tout de suite .
MATER: Yeah , two of them sweets for me too , Sid !
TO HOLLEY: You know , I always wanted to be a spy .
SMILING SWEETLY: Really ? Me too .
SIDDELEY: Afterburners , sir ?
FINN: Is there any other way ?
HOLLEY: No VIN scans . Got it .
FINN: Do n't talk to anyone . Do n't look at anyone . And absolutely , positively no idling . Are we clear ?
HOLLEY: Yes , right . No idling . Yes , sir .
FINN: Mater ?
MATER: Yeah , Finn ?
FINN: We 're not here to go shopping .
MATER: Shopping ? What do you mean ? Why would I -
MERCHANTS: - Parts for sale , Monsieur ! - Monsieur ! Parts for sale !
MATER: You got ta be kidding me - they 've got everything here . Look at them hoods ! I could use a hood .
FINN: There you are .
MATER: Man , there are some great -
FINN: Mater , get back !
MATER: Hey , wait for me !
FINN: Have you lost your mind ? !
HOLLEY: But I thought -
FINN: Mater ! This chap needs a tow . Hook him up .
MATER: Sure thing .
TOMBER: You rusty piece of junk , get you dirty hook off me !
FINN: Allez ! Maintenant - vite !
TOMBER: Electroshock ! Are you kidding me ? ?
FINN: Easy , Tomber . This is her first field assignment - she did n't know you were my informant .
HOLLEY: Informant ?
TOMBER: A rookie , eh ? I never liked new car- smell . Holley FUMES with anger .
FINN: Tomber was doing 20 to life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him , if I recall correctly .
TOMBER: Speaking of recalls , you 're getting up there in mileage are n't you , Finn ?
HOLLEY: Alright , we get it . You both know each other , you 're both old . So .
TOMBER: That is the worst motor ever made . Suddenly , Tomber narrows his gaze .
FINN: Do those parts look familiar , Tomber ?
TOMBER: They should . I sold them .
HOLLEY: To whom ?
TOMBER: No idea . He 's my best customer , but he always does his business ove the phone . I was always wondering why he needs so many parts . Now I know .
MATER: Well , a lemon needs parts . Ai n't nothing truer than that .
FINN: `` Lemon ? ''
MATER: Yeah , you know . Cars that do n't ever work right . Lemons is a tow truck 's bread and butter . Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport .
FINN: Holley , pull up the pictures from the oil platform . I want to know what other type of cars were out there .
HOLLEY: Right . Let 's see . There were Hugos . And Trunkovs .
FINN: Mater , are these cars considered lemons ?
MATER: Is the Popemobile Catholic ?
HOLLEY: Finn . Everyone involved in this plot is one of history 's biggest loser cars .
FINN: And they 're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine .
TOMBER: This explains it !
FINN: What , Tomber ?
TOMBER: Gremlin , Pacer , Hugo and Trunkovs never get together . But they 're having a secret meeting in two days .
FINN: Where 's this meeting taking place ?
TOMBER: Porto Corsa , Italy .
MATER: That 's where the next race is !
FINN: Then there 's a good chance ou mystery engine will be there too .
TOMBER: Your chances are more than good . I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday to Porto Corsa .
FINN: Holley , contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon . Good work .
MATER: You never see this many lemons in one town . Unless there 's a swap meet , or something .
TO HOLLEY: 70 .
HOLLEY: Well , I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa 's red light cameras to do ecognition scans .
MATER: Wow , not only is you the prettiest car I ever met , but you the smartest too .
HOLLEY: Thank you . I think .
MATER: That 's a familiar sight .
FINN: Of course . They must be the heads of the lemon families .
MATER: Makes sense . If I was rich and oke down every day , I 'd hire me to tow me around all the time too .
FINN: We 've got to infiltrate that meeting . It 's the only way to find out who 's behind all this .
HOLLEY: Hang on a minute .
MATER: What ?
HOLLEY: Hold still .
MATER: Ahh !
FINN: Good job , Miss Shiftwell .
HOLLEY: Thank you , Finn .
MATER: Boy , I sure wish my friends could see me now .
LUIGI: Guido , your eyes do not deceive you . We are in Italy . We are home !
FILLMORE: Hey , Luigi . Which way to the hotel , man ?
LUIGI: What ? No friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village . You will stay with my - Uncle Topolino !
SARGE: How do they do it ? These are the same ingredients as back home , but it tastes so good .
FILLMORE: It 's organic , man .
SARGE: Tree hugger .
UNCLE TOPOLINO: You look so down , so low . Is like you have flat tires .
MCQUEEN: No , Mama Topolino , please . You do n't need to make a fuss !
UNCLE TOPOLINO: Capisco . I understand . Is a problem , yes ? Between you and a friend ?
MCQUEEN: How 'd you know that ?
UNCLE TOPOLINO: A wise car hears one word and understands two . McQueen takes this in , impressed .
MCQUEEN: I brought my friend Mater along on the trip . And I told him he needed to act different , that we were n't in Radiator Springs .
UNCLE TOPOLINO: This Mater . He 's a close friend ?
MCQUEEN: He 's my best friend .
UNCLE TOPOLINO: Then why would you ask him to be someone else ? McQueen considers this - a realization .
MCQUEEN: What did I do ? I said some things during our fight
UNCLE TOPOLINO: You know , back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me , they would fight over everything .
MCQUEEN: What does that mean ?
MAMA TOPOLINO: Whoever find a friend , find a treasure .
STEPHENSON: Finn , one hour to Porto Corsa .
FINN: Thank you , Stephenson .
HOLLEY: That should just about do it .
FINN: Perfect .
HOLLEY: So Mater , it 's voice-activated . But you know , everything 's voice- activated these days .
MATER: What ? I thought you was supposed to e making me a disguise .
MATER'S COMPUTER: Voice recognized . Disguise Program Initiated .
MATER: Cool ! Hey , computer . Make me a German truck !
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged .
MATER: Check it out . I 'm wearing Materhosen . Make me a monste truck !
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged .
MATER: I vant to siphon your gas . Now make me a taco truck !
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged .
MATER: A funny car !
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged .
FINN: The idea is to keep a low profile , Mater . Mater , chastened , moves on .
MATER: So I just go in , pretend to be this truck .
FINN: And leave the rest to us .
HOLLEY: Now hold still .
MATER: Hey , what are you doing ?
HOLLEY: The disguise wo n't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto .
MATER: Oh . For a second there I thought you was trying to fix my dents .
HOLLEY: I was .
MATER: Well then no thank you . I do n't get them dents buffed , pulled , filled or painted by nobody . They 're way too valuable .
HOLLEY: Your dents are valuable ?
MATER: I come by each one of them with my est friend Lightning McQueen .
MORE: 77 .
HOLLEY: So you were being serious in Paris ? McQueen is n't just part of you cover ?
FINN: Friendships can be dangerous in ou line of work , Mater .
MATER: But my line of work is towing and salvage .
FINN: Right . And Miss Shiftwell 's is designing iPhone apps .
MATER: No , I meant for real . I -
HOLLEY: It 's okay . Say no more . I 'll work around the dent .
FINN: In the meantime
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: The big news continues to be Allinol . Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answe questions about its safety .
MILES AXLEROD: An independent panel of scientists has determined that Allinol is completely safe . Okay ? Safe ! There it is .
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: So the race will go on , folks .
DARRELL CARTRIP: But the question everyone is asking Will the real Lightning McQueen show up today ?

LUIGI: McQueen ? Is everything okay ?
FILLMORE: If you 're worried about your fuel , man , do n't . It 's perfectly safe .
MCQUEEN: No , guys , I just really wish Mate were here .
FRANCESCO: For famous race cars like Francesco and well you , to be far away from home is not easy .
MCQUEEN: I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult .
FRANCESCO: Is no insult . When Francesco is away from home , he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck amico .
MCQUEEN: Gee , I maybe misjudged you , because that 's exactly how I -
FRANCESCO: Of course , I am at home . And my mama is right here .
MORE: 81 .
MCQUEEN: And there 's the insult we were missing . Grazie !

HOLLEY: Scusatemi , tutti ! Signori !
ANOTHER HUGO: She was talking to me , Ivan .

HOLLEY: I 'm trying It 's too sophisticated !
ENGINE VOICE: We are here to celebrate . Today all your hard work pays off . The world turned their backs on cars like us . They stopped manufacturing us , stopped making our parts . The only thing they have n't stopped doing is laughing at us . They 've called us terrible names On VICTOR HUGO .
FINN: What just happened ?
HOLLEY: I 'm working on it .
ENGINE VOICE: They laughed at us . But now it 's our turn to laugh back .
FINN: Holley ?
HOLLEY: I 'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse .
FINN: Where ?

FINN: Get out of the way ! Andate ! He speeds furiously through town .
ENGINE VOICE: They will come to us and they will have no choice , ` cause they will need us .
ACER: We figured you might stop by .
FINN: No !
ENGINE VOICE: Long live Lemons !
HOLLEY: Finn .

MATER: And then I remembered what they say about old British engines - `` If there ai n't no oil under ` em , there ai n't no oil in ` em . ''
MILES AXLEROD: What is he talking about ?
MATER: It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan . You just blamed it on me .
MILES AXLEROD: Electric cars do n't use oil , you twit .
MATER: Then you 're faking it . You did n't convert to no electric . We pop that hood we gon na see that engine from that picture right there .
MILES AXLEROD: This lorry 's crazy . He 's going to kill us all !
HOLLEY: But Sir Axlerod created the race , Mater . Why would he want to hurt anyone ?
MATER: To make Allinol look bad so everybody 'd go back to using oil . I mean , he said it himself with that disguised voice .
MILES AXLEROD: `` Dee-sguised voice ? '' What are you talking about ? You 're nuts , you are !
PRINCE WHEELIAM: This is going nowhere fast . We eally should go , Grandmother .
QUEEN: One moment . I 'd like to see where this is going .
FINN: Mater , he created Allinol .
MATER: Yeah , but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else ?
MILES AXLEROD: `` What if ? '' You 're basing this on a `` What if '' ? !
GUARD: Okay , that 's it .
MILES AXLEROD: Wait ! Somebody save me ! The lorry 's crazy !
FINN: Mater !
HOLLEY: Mater !
MILES AXLEROD: Someone do something !
FINN: The engine from the photo .
HOLLEY: It 's a perfect match !
MILES AXLEROD: How did the tow truck figure it out ?
MCQUEEN: It 's official . You 're coming to all my races from now on .
MATER: Now you 're talking ! Tire bump .
MCQUEEN: Mater , let 's go . You 're on .
LORD STEWARD: Your Majesty . May I present for the investiture of honorary Knighthood of the British Realm . Tow Mater of Radiator Springs .
MCQUEEN: Go get ` em , buddy .
QUEEN: I hereby dub thee `` Sir Tow Mater . '' Applause from all around .
MATER: `` Sir ? '' Shoot , you can just call me Mater , Your Majesty . I do n't wan na hear none of this `` Sir '' business . By the way , have y'all met each other ? Queen ? McQueen . McQueen , Queen . McQueen ? McMissile .
MORE: 128 .
MATER: So there I was rocket jets going full blast , McQueen hanging on fo dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere , guns drawed . We was goners . But then out of nowhere , this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us !
MINNY: That 's a very entertaining story , young man .
VAN: Oh , Minny , please . Come on , none of this happened . Rocket jets ? Flying spy cars ?
HOLLEY: No , you 're quite right . It does sound a bit far-fetched .
MATER: Holley ! Finn !
HOLLEY: Hello , Mater . It 's so nice to see you again .
MATER: What 're you doing here ?
FINN: Our satellites picked up an urgent communique .
LUIGI: So you got my e-mail .
MATER: Oh , man . Y'all is gon na have a great time . Everybody ! This here 's Finn McMissile . He 's a secret agent .
WHISPERS: Do n't tell nobody . And this is Holley Shiftwell . She 's -
HOLLEY: I 'm Mater 's girlfriend . It 's so nice to meet you all .
LUIGI: Guido believe you now .
FLO: Whoa , honey . You got a nasty dent there .
VAN: Was that from when you swooped in and saved them in London ?
MINNY: Van !
VAN: What ? I 'm just asking .
FLO: Do n't you worry , sweet pea . My baby Ramone can get that fixed up fo you in no time .
RAMONE: Yeah , sure thing . No problemo . Just let me go get my tools .
HOLLEY: Oh no no . I 'm keeping that dent . It 's way too valuable . Mater takes this in .
LIZZIE: A `` valuable '' dent ? Oh , she 's as crazy as Mater .
MACK: Those two are perfect for each other .
MCQUEEN: You know , there 's one thing I still do n't get . The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera , right ? So why did n't I , you know
MATER: Explode in a fiery inferno ?
MCQUEEN: Yeah .
FINN: We could n't figure that one out either .
HOLLEY: Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline . And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode .
MCQUEEN: Wait a second . Fillmore , you said my fuel was safe . McQueen turns to Fillmore . Everyone does .
FILLMORE: If you 're implying that I switched out that rotgut excuse fo alternative fuel with my all- natural , sustainable , organic iofuel just because I neve trusted Axlerod , you 're dead wrong , man .
SARGE: Once Big Oil , always Big Oil . Man .
FILLMORE: Tree hugger .
SHERIFF: The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin ! All spectators clear the starting line !
LEWIS HAMILTON: Man , I ca n't wait to get rockin ' . This is gon na be wicked .
JEFF GORVETTE: Yeah , we should do this every year .
MCQUEEN: I just figured , we never found out who the world 's fastest car is . Plus no press , no trophy . Just acing - the way I like it .
FRANCESCO: Francesco likes it like this too .
MCQUEEN: Francesco . I 'd like you to meet -
FRANCESCO: Signorina Sally . It is official Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world .
SALLY: Why , thank you -
FRANCESCO: Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today .
MCQUEEN: It 's just something I had made up for the occasion .
FRANCESCO: Is good , McQueen . Very funny . It was funnier when I did it , but it 's very funny . What are you going to do next ? Are you going to take off your fenders ? Try it . You 'll like it .
SALLY: So he 's not so good-looking .
MCQUEEN: Yeah . Nice try .
SALLY: I 'm serious .
MCQUEEN: That 's why I love you , Sally . Wish me luck .
SALLY: You do n't need it ! He drives off . Flo approaches Sally .
FLO: Mmm-mmm . That Francesco is fine- looking .
SALLY: And those open wheels .
FLO: I 'm gon na have to go get myself some coolant .
MATER: Go McQueen ! ! Whoo-hoo ! ! ! Holley gets an alert .
HOLLEY: Finn , time to go . Siddeley 's gassed , geared and ready to fly . Finn starts to back up .
MATER: You 're leaving already ?
FINN: We 've got another mission , Mater . Just stopped by here to `` pick something up . '' They both eye Mater , expectantly .
MATER: Something tells me you 're not talking about souvenir bumpe stickers .
FINN: Her Majesty asked for you personally , Mater .
MATER: But I told you all before . I 'm not a spy .
HOLLEY: We know .
FINN: Spy or not , you 're still the smartest , most honest chap we 've ever met .
HOLLEY: Do n't forget massively charming . Mater looks over at Holley . He looks touched .
MATER: Well , thanks . But as much fun as it was hanging with y'all , this
HOLLEY: That 's alright , we understand . But I 'll be back . You still owe me that first date .
FINN: If there 's ever anything I can do for you , just let me know .
MATER: Well , I sure appreciate that , thank you .
THINKS: Actually there is one thing .
MATER: Whoo-hoo ! ! !
OTIS: Whoa ! ! ! - and TOSSING him right into Ramone 's .
FRANCESCO: Impossible ! - until he approaches MCQUEEN .
MCQUEEN: Mater ! ?
MATER: Check it out . They let me keep the ockets !
MCQUEEN: I 'll see you at the finish line , uddy !
MATER: Not if I see you first !
GIRL: I can see you
DARLA: and we know from yesterday that the ase of a triangle times half the height equals the area . A girl in the back row raises her hand .
GIRL: Lucy 's asleep again .
DARLA: Let her sleep .
GANG MEMBER: He would just go off , you know , start tearin ' the place down . You did n't even know why he was doin ' it half the time , you just got out of his way
EMILY: And what you learned from your father now Diego 's learning from you ?
GANG MEMBER: Yeah . Cuz I mean I do n't want him to be like me .
EMILY: A whole week without skipping school ? Is that true ?
WAYNE: How many active cases you have ?
EMILY: Thirty-eight . He drops another file on her desk .
WAYNE: Sorry , Em , we all are .
EMILY: Do n't fight . Hey , that 's his .
DOUG'S VOICE: Exhausted , her career path questionable , her faith in mankind shaken , she resisted her tendency toward introspection and went to have a drink with her friend Doug .
DOUG: I am so in your head . She gives him a kiss . Sits down beside him .
EMILY: Be honest . The whole psychology thing , it 's just about scoring chicks , is n't it ?
DOUG: Regrettably , yes .
EMILY: You know what freaks me out ?
DOUG: That you have a four-year degree and make seventeen grand a year after taxes ?
EMILY: I sit there talking to these families , you know , like I 'm some expert . My family 's a train wreck . I mean , I had this moment today where I realized I might be totally full of it .
DOUG: Everybody 's full of it . In the end you 're a number to call for people who do n't have anyone else . There 's no way that 's bad .
EMILY: Hey Becca
FRIEND: Hey . So one of us is a major screwup , I ca n't remember if I was supposed to call you or the other way around ?
EMILY: No , it 's me , it 's just been a crazy couple weeks . You remember Doug .
FRIEND: Hi . Listen , my ride 's leaving , let 's catch up soon , okay ?
DOUG: So anyway , I 've done some soul searching and I just want to say that if a full-on elationship feels like too much right now , I 'd be willing to consider a purely physical one . Emily , sipping her beer , smiles .
EMILY: I 'm sure I would , I just Hard to explain . Doug saves her the trouble .
DOUG: I know , I know , the job , you get home you do n't have anything left .
EMILY: If it were anyone , it 'd be you .
WOMAN'S VOICE: What ?
EMILY: Emily Jennings . Child Services ? We spoke on the phone ?
MARGARET: You said the seventeenth .
EMILY: Today is the seventeenth .
MARGARET: Is not .
EMILY: I 'm sorry , but it is .
MARGARET: Friday was the thirteenth .
EMILY: Friday was the fourteenth , that makes today the seventeenth . Monday the seventeenth . The date of ou appointment .
LUCY: Lucy .
EMILY: Pretty name . Pretty girl . Lucy turns shyly away .
MARGARET: Well he 's not home so Shrugs again .
EMILY: Do you have any way of contacting him ?
MARGARET: Not if I do n't know where he is .
EMILY: Is that ? Margaret averts her eyes .
MARGARET: He does n't have anything to say .
EMILY: Would you ask him ?
MARGARET: Eddie says we do n't have family problems .
EMILY: That 's just it , many times a family wo n't even know they 're having problems until it 's too late . That 's where we come in . We help families communicate and learn healthier ways of resolving conflict . Edward whispers again in Margaret 's ear .
MARGARET: Eddie says we do n't need your help .
EMILY: Mr Sheridan , is there some reason you wo n't speak to me directly ? Edward just stares at her .
MARGARET: Eddie does n't like speakin ' out of anger .
WAYNE: No laws against being weird , Em . Send it over to CMC , we 'll do a follow-up in a month .
EMILY: I did n't say weird , I said scary . The guy sat there the entire time staring at me , the mother is like his emotional slave . Wayne pauses in mock bewilderment .
WAYNE: Wait , did you just fly to New York and meet my parents ?
EMILY: Wayne , this girl 's in trouble . I can feel it .
WAYNE: Wan na know what I can feel ? The lawsuit we 're gon na get hit with if we violate her parents ' rights without any evidence they 've done something wrong .
EMILY: Every time I talk to you you sound more like a lawyer , you know that ?
WAYNE: Yeah , well , maybe because every time I make an emotional decision I get called y one . I 'm sorry , you 're gon na have to let this one go .
EMILY: You put these files in front of me and you ask me to tell you what 's going on . Well , I 'm telling you , there 's something going on and it 's not something good . I 've done my job , I 've told you , what you do with it is yours .
EDWARD: They really are God 's miracles . Day she was born was the happiest day of ou lives . We 're not perfect parents , we know that , but we figure if you let ` em know how much you love ` em a lot of the other stuff takes care of itself .
EMILY: Tell me , Mr Sheridan , since you 've suddenly acquired the power of speech , does n't it concern you a little that Lucy 's grades have gone from A 's to D 's in three months ?
EDWARD: Course it does , she 's our daughter .
EMILY: So you have no idea why she 's falling asleep at school every day ? Why she 's not able to sleep at home ?
EDWARD: Bad dreams ?
EMILY: He 's gon na be having bad dreams when he gets hit with child endangerment . Do n't tell me you 're buying this daddy 's little girl routine ?
WAYNE: So they 're overcompensating a little .
EMILY: A little ? Let me talk to her . Alone . She wants to talk .
WAYNE: EM
EMILY: Five minutes . Talk to them about how much they love kids . She goes out the door .
LUCY: They hate me .
EMILY: I 'm sure they do n't hate you .
LUCY: They do . I hear them . They go in the cellar and talk .
EMILY: What do they talk about ?
LUCY: Sending me to hell . Emily 's mouth falls open .
EMILY: You 've heard them say that ?
WAYNE: Did you hear your parents say they were going to hurt you ?
EMILY: She does n't trust anybody . You think I made it up ?
WAYNE: I think you 'd do just about anything you had to do to help a child you thought was at risk . Here are the facts , Emily . They have n't laid a finger on her that we can tell . And we have no proof they intend to . Meanwhile on your desk right now are thirty-plus cases of actionable abuse . What about those ?
EMILY: I 'm not giving up on her , Wayne .
WAYNE: Yes , you are , you 're leaving this alone . A look that says he means it .
EMILY: I hope you can live with a dead child on your conscience .
WAYNE: That 's a little unfair , do n't you think ? I care about these kids as much as you do , but we ca n't go around yanking them out of their homes on a hunch . Parents , even bad ones , have rights , that 's how the laws of this great land are written .
EMILY: So that 's it ? We let kids get killed until they rewrite the goddamn laws ?
BARRON: Was just thinking about you , got a nice letter from Sandy Hutchinson
EMILY: Surprise , surprise .
BARRON: I ca n't , Emily . I 'm sorry .
EMILY: Mike , I 'm desperate here .
BARRON: You know how dear to my heart the work you do is , but the department does n't pay me to stakeout potential child abusers . Last time almost cost me my job .
EMILY: This girl heard her parents say they 're going to send her to hell .
BARRON: Sickening as that is , you 're a part of the system that handles those situations , I 'm not .
EMILY: The system is broken .
BARRON: Maybe you just need to let it work .
EMILY: What ? Jesus , I feel like I 'm talking to Wayne . You do n't want to get involved , fine , but do n't bullshit me , I 'm running out of people I respect .
BARRON: Okay . No bullshit . Give me evidence of a crime , I 'll be all over it . Till then there 's nothing I can do .
EMILY: I just wanted you to know I have n't forgotten about you . I 'm doing everything I can . Lucy hugs her , clinging for a moment .
LUCY: If I disappear will you come look for me ?
EMILY: You 're not going to disappear .
LUCY: If I do ?
EMILY: Lucy , wait
ANSWERING MACHINE: Hey , this is Doug , here it comes -
EMILY: It 's me , thought you might be up , um , anyway , call if you get this .
LOSES IT: HELP ME !
BARRON: What are we doing here ?
EMILY: Saving her life !
BARRON: They 're asleep .
EMILY: They 're not asleep . Emily hears something inside the house .
BARRON: I did n't hear anything .
EMILY: Leave her alone !
BARRON: Police , open up !
EMILY: Break it down !
BARRON: The hell 's the matter with you people ? !
EMILY: I gotcha I gotcha I gotcha
STATE PROSECUTOR: Prosecution asks that you disallow an insanity defense . This was an act committed with premeditation , malice
PUBLIC DEFENDER: Your honor , the egregiousness of the crime makes the competency question all the more relevant .
JUDGE: Yes . I hereby order the defendants undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental fitness for trial .
EMILY: Steal a pizza , San Quentin , try killing your kid , Freudian dream analysis .
BARRON: Well , you 're gon na hate me for saying this , but my money 's on crazy .
EMILY: Did they or did they not know what they were doing ? That 's the legal standard . They knew , they knew damn well !
BARRON: It 's not that simple sometimes .
EMILY: Meaning what exactly ?
BARRON: When we brought them in that night they told Captain Lister They think she 's evil , some kind of demon spirit , minion of the devil or something .
EMILY: Oh , that 's great - what is this , late- night cable ?
BARRON: No , but that might be the world they 're living in .
DOUG: and what 's the most important thing we talked about that you have to remember ?
LUCY: It 's not my fault what happened .
DOUG: That 's right and you know what ? It 's not .
EMILY: Yeah , I 'm okay . How 's she doing ?
DOUG: Typical reaction , blames herself . We 'll get there . I 'm gon na put her in a group setting , see if I can get her to open up .
EMILY: Group therapy for kids , what 's that say about the world ?
LUCY: Doug said I might have to go to a state home .
EMILY: Only for a few days , till we find a etter place .
LUCY: Why ca n't I live with you ?
EMILY: Oh , sweetheart . That would never be allowed .
LUCY: Why ?
EMILY: It 's complicated , there 's a whole process , I 'm not even a foster parent Lucy gives a sad nod . Emily touches her arm .
COORDINATOR: They were supposed to call you . We do n't have any rooms .
EMILY: Nothing ?
COORDINATOR: There was a mixup with the dates . Sorry .
EMILY: Hey , are you hungry ? Let 's get some lunch . What kind of food do you like ?
LUCY: There 's nowhere for me to go is there ?
EMILY: I ca n't , Lucy , it would n't work , I live in this tiny house , I I 'm sorry , I 'm not mom material
LUCY: You do n't have to be my mom . Just my friend .
EMILY: I know what it feels like to be that age and be unwanted . It 's terrifying . She needs to be with someone she trusts ; she trusts me . So much of our time is spent negotiating red tape , I think if we just look at the situation - this one situation , this one child - it 's clea what 's best for her .
NANCY: This is highly irregular and I 'll tell you right now it makes me very uncomfortable . But since , Wayne , you 've spoken so persuasively on Miss Jennings 's ehalf
EMILY: I like to think of it as a glass-half- full situation . Kitchen . Bathroom . Fish . And here , is your room
LUCY: Where 's your family ?
EMILY: My family well , I 've met my dad twice and my mom 's not a part of my life anymore .
LUCY: Why ?
EMILY: Sometimes people have kids and then decide they do n't want to be parents .
LUCY: What 's this ?
EMILY: Chamomile , when I get stressed out it helps me sleep .
LUCY: You did .
EMILY: I 'm right down the hall if you need me .
COURT CLERK: I trust ya , Em , make sure you lock it on the way out .
DOUG: Sometimes when our parents are n't getting along it 's better if they do n't see each other for a while , that 's what a ` restraining order ' does
EMILY: I went by the house . I think her mom and dad were barricading themselves in thei oom at night . How sick is that ?
DOUG: Hatred and fear are part of the same pathology - oh , but I forgot , you do n't think they 're crazy .
EMILY: I 'm coming around . As they part ways
LUCY: I love you , Emily . Emily , touched , smiles .
EMILY: I love you , too .
COWORKER: Wayne 's looking for you . The second person
COWORKER #2: Wayne wants to
EMILY: Got it .
WAYNE: Why do n't we talk in my office .
EMILY: Tell me what 's going on .
WAYNE: We do n't know why yet , but he killed his mother and father last night . Emily stands there , jaw on the floor .
EMILY: What happened ?
BARRON: Sure you want to see this ? With an uncertain nod she follows him inside .
EMILY: An eight-year-old did this ? There 's no way .
BARRON: I was there when they brought him in . Took three guys my size to subdue him . Kid was climbing the walls .
EMILY: Where is he now ?
BARRON: Juvie lockup . And , no , I 'm not taking you to see him .
EMILY: You want to know what happened ?
BARRON: I know what happened .
EMILY: I do n't . I need to talk to him . Mike , please , I care about this kid .
DIEGO: Are they dead ?
EMILY: What happened ? Tell me what happened .
DIEGO: I killed my mum and dad
DOUG: Every family you sit down with every day of every week is a family in crisis . Those are your odds . That 's the job you do . Trying to beat them . Wipes away her tears . The hair from her face .
THEN: I know somebody you did save .
LUCY: You okay ?
EMILY: It 's just work . Do n't worry .
LUCY: Why do you do it if it makes you sad ?
EMILY: My job ? I do n't know , I guess I guess maybe I want to believe families can work , so I can have my own someday , I do n't know - does that make sense ?
LUCY: I 'm sorry I wanted to know what happened to you .
EMILY: She used to just leave , she 'd just
GESTURES `ADIOS': and I never knew when she was coming ack , or if she was I used to think it was my fault and I would try so hard when she got home to be good , do everything I could think of , so she 'd think I was ` special ' and stay next time or take me with her , but it did n't matter , she 'd always go away again , that 's how it was .
LUCY: Where was your dad ?
EMILY: Gone , he left before I was born . First time I met him I was like thirteen .
LUCY: What 'd you say to him ?
EMILY: Oh , I had all these things I was gon na say . Angry things I 'd thought of and kind of memorized . And um . And then I met him and I was n't angry , I was just sad and I told him I said , I love you , even if you do n't love me .
LUCY: Are you mad at me ?
EMILY: No No , I 'm not mad at you . But I need you not to do that again , okay ? Go through my private things without asking ?
WAYNE: I need another set of eyes to go ove them , make sure we have n't missed anything else .
EMILY: You mean , to make sure I have n't missed anything else ?
WAYNE: It 's just a legal thing . You 'll have them back tomorrow .
BARRON: You watch , six months , their lawyer will hire some expert to say they 're rehabbed and they 'll sue for custody when they get out .
EMILY: She 's not going back there , I 'll take he out of state before I let them near he again .
BARRON: I did n't hear you say that .
EMILY: You wanted to talk about something ?
BARRON: We pulled the Martinezes ' phone records . They got a call that night before the murders .
EMILY: From who ?
BARRON: Emily , the call came from your house .
EMILY: What ?
BARRON: Look , I 'm not accusing you of anything , I just need to know what was said .
EMILY: That 's impossible . I might have called the week before ?
BARRON: I 'm talking to you as a friend here , you know that , right ?
EMILY: Did you not hear me ? I 'm telling you , Mike , as a friend , I did not call that family .
BARRON: Then who did ? Go find the guy who broke in and just happened to dial the numbe of a kid whose case you handle .
LUCY: He 's in my group why , did something happen ?
BARRON: We 're trying to figure out why . He got a call Thursday night from this number . I 'm just wondering if he might have said anything
LUCY: It was n't me .
BARRON: You did n't call him ?
LUCY: I am telling the truth .
EMILY: My backup files are in your room . Diego 's is in there . Maybe you got curious and went through some , dialed a number ?
LUCY: It was n't me , I swear .
BARRON: The call was at 2 am , are you ever up that late ?
LUCY: I did n't call him .
BARRON: Are you ever up that late ?
EMILY: Mike , she said no . Maybe someone made a mistake .
BARRON: Yeah , maybe so . Night , Lucy .
LUCY: Do you believe me ?
EMILY: I believe you .
DOUG: Copy of the Sheridans ' psych evals fo the file . And the cognitive profile Lucy did for me the other day .
EMILY: How 's it look ?
DOUG: You have to beg .
SAME BREATH: Coming from an environment like that , testing this normal is a bit abnormal , if that makes any sense .
EMILY: She 's ` abnormally normal ' ?
DOUG: I think she faked it , gave the answers she thought she should .
EMILY: Why would she do that ?
DOUG: She 's ashamed of who she is . Ashamed of how she feels . Afraid nobody would want her if they saw the real her . It 's no big deal , it just means I might have to push her a little .
EMILY: No , I know , I just The Martinezes ' got a call Thursday night . From my house .
DOUG: Did you ask her about it ?
EMILY: She said she did n't . Mike thinks she 's lying .
DOUG: What do you think ?
EMILY: I do n't know what to think .
DOUG: Hmm . Bring her in after work , I 'll do a one-on-one . I wanted to talk to he about this anyway .
EMILY: Got you an extra in case it gets cold . Diego nods without looking up .
NURSE: He asked to see you before you left .
EMILY: Who called you ? Was it Lucy ?
DIEGO: El dijo
EMILY: ` El ' dijo ? What do you mean , ` He said ' ?
DIEGO: Era un hombre . A chill goes through Emily .
EMILY: It was a man ?
LUCY: Do
TURNS: you
EMILY: Well , photocopying is n't much fun .
DOUG: Knock , knock . Sorry I 'm late , guys .
TO LUCY: Ready , kiddo ? Lucy nods and gets up from the chair .
DOUG: Go ahead down , I 'll be right there .
EMILY: This is weird . Diego said it was Lucy that called , but he called her a he , he said it was a man .
DOUG: So how 's school ?
LUCY: Fine .
DOUG: Any of your classmates giving you a hard time ?
LUCY: No , they 've been nice .
DOUG: Sleeping okay ?
LUCY: That 's not really what you want to talk about , is it , Doug ? Awkward pause . Awkward smile .
DOUG: You got me .
LUCY: I 'll tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you . Doug did not see this coming .
DOUG: Fair enough . When I was twelve I was climbing a tree and I accidentally put my hand through a giant hornets ' nest . They did n't like it . I got stung over a hundred times . They had to rush me to the hospital . I 've been afraid of hornets ever since . Do n't climb many trees either .
SMILES: Everybody has fears . Now , what scares you ?
LUCY: Me . Pause .
DOUG: You scare yourself ?
LUCY: Sometimes .
DOUG: Why , what about yourself scares you ?
LUCY: I have bad thoughts .
DOUG: About what ?
LUCY: People .
DOUG: People in general or certain people ?
LUCY: Certain people .
DOUG: Like who ?
LUCY: You .
DOUG: You have bad thoughts about me ?
SHE NODS: Why ?
LUCY: I just do .
DOUG: Was there something I said or did that upset you ?
LUCY: It 's just the way you are
DOUG: How am I ?
LUCY: Facile .
DOUG: Facile ? Do you even know what that means ?
LUCY: Easily comprehended . Often lacking sincerity or depth . You 're smug , too . Want me to tell you what that means ?
DOUG: Well , if , um , if I seemed ` smug ' o ` facile ' I want to -
LUCY: Do n't apologize .
DOUG: Why ?
LUCY: You 're a grown up , it 's embarrassing .
THEN; DEADPAN: 50 .
LUCY CONT'D: Should we talk about school now ? My grades are getting a lot better . Doug just stares at her .
DOUG: Talked to a lot of ten-year-olds , I do n't think I 've ever felt like that before
EMILY: Like what ?
DOUG: Threatened .
THEN; BAFFLED: I know a specialist , I 'll call him in the morning .
EMILY: What do I do with her in the meantime ? Doug pauses , no idea , smiles an eerie smile .
DOUG: Do n't let her get in your head .
LUCY: Are you mad at me ?
EMILY: No . Just tired .
LUCY: Want me to brush your hair ?
EMILY: That 's okay .
LUCY: Are you sure ?
EMILY: Some other time .
LUCY: It will make you feel better . I 'll get the brush .
EMILY: I said no , thank you .
LUCY: Doug said something , did n't he ?
EMILY: No . Doug ? He says you 're doing great . Tense silence .
LUCY: What did he tell you ?
EMILY: Nothing .
LUCY: You 're funny .
EMILY: Get some rest .
LUCY: You forgot to kiss me goodnight .
EMILY: Goodnight . Lucy clutches her wrist as she turns to go .
LUCY: I love you . Emily , trapped , forces a tender smile .
EMILY: I love you , too .
DOUG: Hello ?
DOUG: FUCK !
EMILY: See you next week .
DENISE: Seen Doug ? He had an appointment with one of my kids this morning , never showed up .
EMILY: Did you try calling him ?
DENISE: All I get is voicemail .
ANSWERING MACHINE: Hey , this is Doug , here it comes -
EMILY: Cover my desk .
CORONER: Winters oh , right , Douglas .
EMILY: How did he die ?
CORONER: Family ?
EMILY: Friend . I know the rules please , he meant a lot to me .
CORONER: Compression fracture of the third and forth vertebrae . Severed his spinal cord . Actual cause of death was suffocation .
EMILY: You 're saying he did that to himself ?
CORONER: It appears all his injuries were self- inflicted , yes .
EMILY: Oh come on . He looked like he 'd been eaten to death ! Do n't tell me he was some - some suicidal
BREAKING DOWN: I knew him ! He was my best friend ! She turns away crying .
CORONER: Miss , I would never presume to know you friend better than you . But the injuries suggest he was trying to hurt himself . Unfortunately , he succeeded . I am sorry .
EMILY: Have you ever seen this before , somebody dying like this ? The coroner files the report , world weary .
CORONER: Truly , I am shocked every day by the violence people do to themselves .
LUCY: You think it 's my fault , do n't you ?
EMILY: It was an accident . It was nobody 's fault .
BARRON: Listen . You 're still in shock . Let 's
EMILY: Diego said it was a man on the phone . You know who made that call . There was no one else in the house . You think I do n't know how crazy this sounds ? !
BARRON: Look , I do n't know , all I 'm saying is a kid in his state of mind maybe is n't the most reliable witness .
EMILY: Why is he in that state of mind ? Why was Doug ? Pull my phone records . See if she called him .
BARRON: Emily . I already did . There were no calls from your house .
EMILY: Her mother and father , their bedroom doo has these deadbolts on it , big ones , two of ` em Something came through that door and they did n't want it ever coming through there again .
MARGARET: You mean what were we doing it for ?
EDWARD: THE HELL DID I JUST SAY ? !
CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST: Woke up screaming , absolutely convinced she was on fire . She was n't , of course , they managed to sedate her . But it 's curious , she displays all the symptoms of a burn patient . Except the urns themselves
EMILY: Okay .
EDWARD: Who died ?
EMILY: A friend .
EDWARD: You 're scared . Emily , skewered again , nods yes .
THEN: Ask what you came to ask . After a moment
EMILY: What is she ?
EDWARD: Can tell you what she 's not . She not a daughter of mine . She 's not a ten-year- old having trouble in school . She 's not some innocent victim whose door you usted down and life you saved . And she 's not going no place , lady , till she 's good and done with you .
EMILY: Done with me how ?
EDWARD: However she wants . You think it 's an accident her ending up with you ? She saw you coming a mile away .
EMILY: Why me ? I do n't have anything .
EDWARD: You have that you 're good . Kindness . Decency . That 's what she feeds on . Bleeds ya dry , moves onto the next . We were a big family , she went through us like a wrecking ball . And you know , every time something happened , every time , we had an excuse for why it was n't her fault . Cuz it 's easier to lie to yourself than think bad things about you aby girl . But finally we got to a point where me and Maggy looked at each other - - where we looked at each other and we was out of lies , both of us . Most terrifying moment of our lives . And that 's where you are now . Emily silently registering this truth .
MORE: 66 .
EDWARD CONT'D: Only time you got the upper hand is when she 's sleepin ' but she almost never does . We checked on her every night for three months . Every twenty minutes , up and down those stairs . First time she slept was the night you kicked in my front door . After a moment
EMILY: What does she want ?
EDWARD: To know what your idea of hell is and make you live there .
EMILY: What should I do ? A pitying smile reveals Edward 's wired teeth .
EDWARD: How strong 's your faith ?
EMILY: Nancy ?
NANCY: Emily , I heard about Doug . I 'm so sorry .
EMILY: Do you have a minute ?
NANCY: How 's it working out with the Sheridan girl ?
EMILY: Actually , that 's why I 'm here . I appreciate what you did for me , Nancy , I eally do , but I think it 'd be best if she was placed in foster care .
NANCY: She is . You 're it .
EMILY: I know , but it 's not working out .
NANCY: Playing mommy is n't the laugh-a-minute you were hoping , huh ?
EMILY: I suppose not . Nancy nods , not entirely surprised .
NANCY: Sorry , you petitioned for custody , you got it . She 's your responsibility .
EMILY: Until when ?
NANCY: Till we find a suitable foster home .
EMILY: How long is that going to take ?
NANCY: You 're asking me questions you know the answer to . Three to six weeks . Surely you can manage that long .
EMILY: I do n't want her anymore . I 'm done . That 's it . Nancy grimaces . Scary lady .
NANCY: Now you look . I put my reputation , quite possibly my career , on the line for you . Do n't embarrass me . You make this work .
EMILY: How do I make it work if it 's not working ?
NANCY: However ! Find a way !
HARDWARE CLERK: That what you 're looking for ?

LUCY: Wow . That one , too . Emily , caught in a lie , says nothing .
EMILY: Who ?
LUCY: My mother . She turns for Emily 's reaction .
EMILY: How - how would I know that ?
LUCY: I thought you said you were going to see her .
EMILY: I never said that .
LUCY: Hm . I must have dreamt it . Goes into the bathroom . Closes the door .
EMILY: I do n't care , Robin , anywhere . Just find somewhere that will take her . Tonight . I do n't want this girl in my house .
LUCY: Good night .
BARRON: Emily ?
EMILY: Mike .
BARRON: You wan na end up where they did keep talking like this . I 'm not judging you . You 're grieving fo Doug and you 're still confused about what Diego did .
EMILY: Are n't you ?
BARRON: Diego grew up in a bad home , he saw violence and he repeated it , that 's the cycle , you know that better than anyone .
EMILY: Why did she lie about calling him ?
BARRON: ` Cause she 's a liar , that does n't mean she made him do it . Look , let me tell you what Lucy is . Lucy is a damaged child , a deceitful child , a manipulative child . But a damaged , deceitful , manipulative child is not a demon . Ask my brother-in-law , he 's got a couple of ` em . Barron stands from the bench .
EMILY: Mike , you know I 'm not crazy . Do n't run away from something just because it scares you .
BARRON: I stopped you on the steps . I think maybe you oughta go all the way in .
NANCY: Who do you think you are barging in there like that ? !
EMILY: I do n't want her in group anymore , I do n't want her around the other kids .
NANCY: Well that 's not your decision , is it ? !
LUCY: It 's okay , Nancy , Emily 's been under a lot of stress lately , but she 's really nice to me and I hope I can stay with he a really long time .
NANCY: We 'll talk about this later . Storms off .
LUCY: See you next week , Nancy .

EMILY: W-w-what 's happening - ? ! Lucy has gotten her attention .
LUCY: Can I go back to group next week ?
EMILY: You 're never going back there !
LUCY: Are you sure ?

LUCY: I can see you .
EMILY: Mrs Lynch , I told you - will you let - that 's not what I said - no , I did not - you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will you let me respond ? - will you let me - Mrs Lynch - will you let - Emily ca n't take it anymore . She unloads .
WAYNE: Um , so , I notice you have n't taken any personal days . Come on , you look like crap , go home . Emily levels a withering stare .
EMILY: I do n't want to go home .
BECCA: Emily
EMILY: I know I have n't been a great friend lately , but do you think maybe I could crash here for a couple of nights ?
BECCA: Sure , when ?
EMILY: Tonight and tomorrow .

EDWARD: She starts all over again somewhere else . Ca n't let her stay , ca n't let her go . That leaves you with one option .
EMILY: I ca n't , Edward , I
EDWARD: You have to . You have to find the strength . Do n't you understand ? That 's why she 's doing this . To test you . Test your faith .
EMILY: I do n't have any faith .
EDWARD: How ` bout anger . Got some of that ? Emily lowers her gaze to the table .
EMILY: How how do I ?
EDWARD: Kill her ? In her sleep , assuming you can
THEN; THINKING: Tell you what I 'd do different . Count myself dead at the outset . Accept that going in and use it to my advantage . That 's the one thing I do n't think she 'd see coming , someone giving up their own life to take hers . As Emily registers this
EMILY: Mike ? No reply .

LITTLE NICKY: Mom !
JENNIFER: Yeah , well , Can I make a fuckin ' phone call ?
DUPREY: Grab everything in sight .
AUSTIN: I want all those papers seized , egardless of what they are .

MARINO: All right . Strip him .
NICKY: No balls , you got no fuckin ' balls . Oh , Dominick . Oh , Dom .
MARINO: Come on , come on . Bury 'em .
MAN #1: Mister , you all right ?
MAN #2: Watch out , the - !
ACE: Yeah .
AMBULANCE DRIVER: You sure are lucky , mister . ACE 's face disappears into the ambulance .
ACE: Still not sure ?
RACE ANNOUNCER: They 're off and running
ACE: Probable , but may be questionable . All right . Well , let me know as soon as you can find out .
CHUCK: My guess is we 're talking fuel filters here , Fernando . The gas is dirty , these jitneys get in the mountains , thei engines cut out .
FERNANDO: That could lose us half an hour .
CHUCK: Easy . Each way . His beeper goes off .
ALEKSEI: Six kilometers . Four miles .
CHUCK: So how are we going to get this place shaped up ? There 's a muttered chorus of answers .
TRANSLATOR: He says they have been very busy . It is hard to get good employees . He is sure you understand .
ALEKSEI: Phone call . Malaysia .
CHUCK: Kamal ? Right . I 'm getting them .
ALEKSEI: It 's bad .
CHUCK: Worse than Warsaw .
ALEKSEI: Nobody remembers that .
CHUCK: The failures they remember . It 's the successes they forget .
TRANSLATOR: He says he wants to be organized . Do packages in order .
CHUCK: So how come the other drivers have n't left yet ?
TRANSLATOR: He says he is a very rude fellow
CHUCK: Tell me exactly what he said .
TRANSLATOR: He says why do n't his farts smell sweet ?
CHUCK: Lev it 's Lev , right ? Listen , this is FedEx . We do n't have to accept the way it is .
LEV: We 've never got all the trucks in on time . Never . Chucks looks at the clock .
CHUCK: Only one still left ?
LEV: Route six . Aleksei points at the big semi .
ALEKSEI: If we do n't send it now we may miss the connection in Paris .
CHUCK: Give it five minutes .
LEV: We did it . All of them .
CHUCK: Great job , everyone . Remember , work together . We are like a hand
LEV: One finger , weak . All fingers working together , strong . This makes Chuck smile .
CHUCK: You got it .
JACK: Ca n't help you . Try UPS .
CHUCK: Jack got ta be something wrong with ou physicals , you keep getting certified to fly . Gwen , are n't you worried ?
GWEN: Terrified .
CHUCK: We 're on time , right ?
JACK: On time , Chuck . Chuck hands Jack and Gwen small packages .
CHUCK: Little present from the emerging epublics .
GWEN: You are such a lifer .
STAN: What do you expect , from the guy who stole a kid 's bicycle when his truck oke down ?
CHUCK: Borrowed . I borrowed it . The two of them strap in .
STAN: How 'd it go ?
CHUCK: Great . Terrific . The good guys won one for a change .
STAN: I had to bump your plane last night . Chuck ca n't believe it .
CHUCK: You what ?
STAN: It was fifteen minutes late . The plane begins to taxi .
CHUCK: I checked the weather , you had the jet stream , you could have made it up .
STAN: But I might not have .
CHUCK: Jesus . I got it working You have no idea how hard it was They 're finally a team
STAN: I 'm touched .
CHUCK: You fucked us over .
STAN: The point of FedEx , as I understand it , is to make the damn connection .
CHUCK: I was making a point .
STAN: What ? Let Paris hold its plane ? Let Memphis take care of it ? Let somebody down the line clean up your mess ?
CHUCK: Every person counts , every package counts , that 's my point .
STAN: You know what your problem is ? You just see the packages in front of you . You do n't see the big picture .
CHUCK: Baloney . I do see the damn `` big picture . ''
STAN: I did n't know we had sailboats .
CHUCK: It 's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered .
STAN: For all those vacation days you got coming . Chuck does n't look up .
CHUCK: And never take .
STAN: Look , I 'm sorry about your plane . But I could n't risk being late into Memphis .
CHUCK: Forget it .
STAN: You know General McLelland , he would n't attack unless he had everything just ight . Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said , General , if you 're not going to use my army , could I borrow it for a while ? So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said , let 's go .
CHUCK: I 'm from Arkansas . Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I 'll pay attention .
STAN: We 're warriors , not desk jockeys . We 've got to be bold . You always want all you ducks lined up . But nothing 's 100 percent . It 's always 60-40 , maybe 51-49 . Hell , I 'd take 40-60 . Then roll the dice .
CHUCK: That 's why you 're a gambling man .
STAN: That 's why I 'm running foreign and you 're not . That 's why you 're not married and I am .
CHUCK: For the third time .
STAN: Take the plunge , admit your mistakes , move on to tomorrow . That 's FedEx , that 's women , that 's life .
CHUCK: You are one sick fucker .
STAN: I 'm trying to help you here . There 's Warsaw , there 's this
CHUCK: This was nothing like Warsaw . I held the truck then minutes , it 's not that big a deal . But apparently it is .
STAN: Look , that kids ' bike , that 's a guy who 'll do what it takes to get there on time . Live up to your legend , that 's all I 'm saying .
CHUCK: A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month .
STAN: Ninety five percent ? Just give me the money now .
CHUCK: Talk is cheap . Are we on or not ?
STAN: We 're on . Chuck closes the PowerBook .
CHUCK: Let 's go off-line .
STAN: And the Stones . Got to be .
CHUCK: Damn thing .
GUY: Xerox machine .
KELLY: Sonofabitch !
CHUCK: Hey , be nice to it , it 'll be nice to you . Surprised , Kelly turns to greet Chuck .
KELLY: Chuck ! You 're back ! She leaps into his arms .
CHUCK: You smell like formaldehyde . Kelly looks over at the Xerox .
KELLY: My last chapter 's in there , and the damn machine 's jammed .
CHUCK: Let 's take a look . He lifts up the cover .
KELLY: How was Russia ?
CHUCK: Cold .
KELLY: Do n't overwhelm me with details , you know how I hate that . Did you get it fixed ?
CHUCK: I thought I did . He pries up one feeder , then another .
KELLY: Chuck , forget the Xerox . So Russia did n't turn out well ?
CHUCK: Used to you could fix these yourself .
KELLY: Chuck .
CHUCK: What do you want me to say ? That I thought I 'd done a great job but it all turned to shit ? That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did ?
KELLY: Yeah , tell me . Tell me all of it . He suddenly looks really tired .
CHUCK: And I ca n't fix this damn machine . She looks at him .
KELLY: Come on .
CHUCK: That 's carcinogenic . She ignores that , stays with the fantasy .
KELLY: We 're covered with suntan lotion and sweat . Our skin is so hot , it 's glowing And she comes closer to him .
CHUCK: On the other hand we could not take a swim They squiggle themselves onto the desk .
BECCA: So why was Milan late , Colin ?
COLIN: One of the race horses coming from Ireland got colic and had to be off- loaded in Brussels . That put the Jumbo 15 , six hours late into Charles De Gaulle . Customs had difficulty locating the dutiable items
BECCA: Stan , can we get P & A down to work with Milan customs ?
STAN: We 're already on it .
BECCA: Good . And let 's look at our live animal policy . I do n't think the income stream justifies delaying IP product , especially at Christmas .
CHUCK: Becca , as you know St. Petersburg was consistently running late by six to ten hours sometimes a full day or more . I eplaced the station manager . We identified inefficiencies and worked out a quality improvement plan I believe can e met .
MAYNARD: You replaced the station manager with a driver . A local with no knowledge of ou systems .
BECCA: Should n't you have brought in someone from Memphis ? Russia is priority one .
MAYNARD: James Pottinger is available .
STAN: He 's a numbers cruncher . Chuck 's done all the right things here Stan is doing his best to back up Chuck .
CHUCK: Jim 's a terrific financial man , no question . But we ca n't always parachute in from Memphis . We 've got to build up our local staff .
MAYNARD: We 've got to improve foreign on-time , that 's what we 've got to do . If this new guy 's so good , how come the very first plane he sent missed the connection in Paris ?
CHUCK: We 're building a new team here . We got every package on the truck for the first time ever . Success is the best teacher .
MAYNARD: I do n't call missing the plane a success . Everyone looks at Chuck .
KELLY: Merry Christmas eve .
CHUCK: Not if you work for FedEx .
KELLY: You break four million packages last night ?
CHUCK: Four four . A record .
KELLY: You do n't seem too happy about it .
CHUCK: Ah , the staff meeting could have gone etter .
KELLY: Let me guess , Russia came up ? Chuck 's attention goes to the tree .
CHUCK: One of those packages just moved .
KELLY: Merry Christmas . Chuck bends down to see the puppy .
CHUCK: Hey , look at you .
KELLY: I figure , if we could take care of a puppy , we could , you know , take care of
CHUCK: He is a cute thing .
KELLY: He 's your cute thing .
CHUCK: I ca n't even keep fish alive .
KELLY: A puppy 's got a little more personality than a fish .
CHUCK: And for you Chuck hands over his present .
KELLY: So do good things come in large packages ?
CHUCK: You know , for when you travel .
KELLY: For when I travel ?
CHUCK: I was n't sending a message . I though you 'd like it . Chuck 's beeper goes off .
KELLY: You should have got me a ring . He checks the number .
CHUCK: I have to go . I 'm on call for overflow down at the Hub .
KELLY: A ring . I wanted a ring .
CHUCK: You did ? She nods . What to do ?
KELLY: You ca n't go now .
CHUCK: I have to .
KELLY: You want to . Chuck picks up the puppy .
CHUCK: What should we call him ? Or is it her ? How about Jango ?
KELLY: This is n't working out .
CHUCK: We 're a little emotional here . It 's Christmas , maybe we 're over-reacting .
KELLY: `` We 're '' not over-reacting .
CHUCK: Could you watch Jango ?
KELLY: No .
CHUCK: I ca n't take him to work . He hands her the puppy .
MOM: What happened to your pants ?
CHUCK: Mom , meet Jango . Chuck displays the puppy .
AMANDA: Dinner 's ready .
MOM: Chuck ? Chuck hesitates just a moment .
CHUCK: Bless us O Lord , and these thy gifts , which we are about to receive , from thou ounty , through Christ the Lord . Amen .
ROGER: Let 's eat .
MARY: How 's Kelly ?
CHUCK: Great .
ROGER: Thought you were going to bring her .
CHUCK: So did I .
MOM: It seemed like she had such a good time last time .
CHUCK: It 's nothing you did , Mom , believe me .
MARY: Jennifer 's still down at the post office . And she 's still got that crush on you .
ROGER: And she 's still got those
MARY: Roger .
ROGER: You should have stuck around . This is an old , sore subject .
CHUCK: Look , I help take care of the place . You got my check , did n't you Mom ?
MOM: That new roof , that 's your doing .
ROGER: You 're just allergic to farming , that 's what dad said . Ca n't stand to be alone . Ca n't stand to be in one place . Ca n't stand the sight ofblood . He drops the turkey giblets into the trash .
MARY: Roger 's going to put chickens in here . Chuck ca n't believe this .
CHUCK: Come on Roger , this is dad all ove again . You already did beefalo , chinchillas , and what was that , ostrich ? They chased Mom around the yard , sprained her hip .
MOM: It was n't that bad , dear .
MARY: You ca n't make a living out of this place . We tried .
CHUCK: But chickens ?
ROGER: Sixty three pounds consumed per capita , up from twenty seven in 1960 . Going to pass beef . Chicken 's global . No eligious taboos . You do n't see you Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry .
CHUCK: True enough . No sacred chickens nowhere , so far as I know .
MOM: Roger 's working at Tyson 's now .
CHUCK: Really ?
ROGER: Come on down to the plant . It 's state of the art . We 're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business .
CHUCK: Just do n't count 'em before they hatch .
ROGER: I 'll try to remember that .
MOM: Dessert .

GOODCHUCK: Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean oll .
BADCHUCK: I 'm lost . Goodbye .

BADCHUCK: Look , just slip off the raft . The ocean would feel so good , the water 's so soft and warm . Take a little swim . Sleep .
GOODCHUCK: You quitter you quitter you quitter .
BADCHUCK: The sea is lovely , dark and deep .
GOODCHUCK: But I have promises to keep . And miles to go before I sleep . And miles to go before I sleep . Got to fix the sea anchor . Use the sail .

BADCHUCK: You are .
GOODCHUCK: Jesus .
BADCHUCK: Look again , asshole . It 's a mirage . Chuck squints .
GOODCHUCK: It 's real .
BADCHUCK: Nothing out there but ocean .
GOODCHUCK: Let 's get a second opinion . Wilson ? What do you see ?
CHUCK: Chuck Noland . Born October 8 , 1958 . Died pick a date July 11 , 1998 . And now the epitaph . Met deadlines . Kept appointments . Lost without a trace . He sits back , looks at the mock headstone .
BADCHUCK: What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day ? The next day we just start over again .
GOODCHUCK: It matters . We do the best we can , that 's all we have .
BADCHUCK: Then we 've just got shit . He goes on writing .
CHUCK: I am writing this to remind myself to live a better life . If I am lost , perhaps you who find this will be instructed to live a better live yourself . Live each day . Love you children . Do n't take anyone for granted .
BADCHUCK: Is that it ? Life is a fucking Disney movie ?
GOODCHUCK: Shut up . I do n't feel like dying today .
CHUCK: Please , no sharks .
DOCTOR: Under the circumstances your overall health is good . Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated , ut they 're healing nicely . He checks his blood work records .
CHUCK: Sorrysorry Why do my joints still ache ?
DOCTOR: Dehydration . Vitamin deficiency . Protein deficiency . Any or all of the above .
CHUCK: All I ate was fish . That 's solid protein .
DOCTOR: Protein digestion is very costly in wate usage .
CHUCK: Which I did n't have .
DOCTOR: And fish are very low in fat , which is energy inefficient . So you 're going to urn up your own cells no matter how much you eat . Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas , which contain some Vitamin C , so you did n't get scurvy . Chuck laughs again .
CHUCK: I am one lucky guy .
DOCTOR: Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability , depression , anxiety , periods of self-reproach . It 's almost like schizophrenia . Different sides of your personality might come to life , speak out , act out .
CHUCK: But all that 's behind me . I 'm fine now . He starts to laugh again .
DOCTOR: If you say you are .
CHUCK: I most definitely say I am .
DOCTOR: Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you . Chuck stifles his laughter .
CHUCK: Yes , yes he did .
DOCTOR: You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life ?
CHUCK: Not to mention on me . The laughter again . Unsettling .
DOCTOR: You sure you do n't want some counseling ? Chuck gives his biggest smile .
CHUCK: Doc , I 'm not on the island . I 'm not on the raft . I 'm alive . I 'm so glad to be ack , I ca n't tell you . I just want out of here .
DOCTOR: Well , when that IV runs out , you 're through with us . Just the dentist tomorrow .
CHUCK: Stan , it 's ChuckChuck Noland The laughter again .
TECHNICIAN: You sure you do n't want to have the implant done here ? We do quite good work .
STAN: Chuck ! God damn ! Chuck struggles out of the chair .
CHUCK: I beat the odds !
STAN: You beat 'em to shit , pal ! Jesus !
TECHNICIAN: I still need to floss you . Stan notices the technician .
STAN: Hello .
CHUCK: This is Amber . Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack .
TECHNICIAN: Ex-boyfriend .
STAN: Really .
KELLY: I 'm sorry I 'm sorry
CHUCK: Heyheyit 's okay ! Chuck is happy , he 's still riding the high .
KELLY: You 're so thin . Am I hurting you ?

CHUCK: A few things came up . Or went down .
KELLY: I got married .
CHUCK: I thought you might have .
KELLY: I would never
CHUCK: I know .
KELLY: If I 'd known you were alive
CHUCK: I would have done the same thing .
KELLY: I did n't want to . It just happened . One day Gary was there . He took care of everything . He took care of me . I was a mess .
CHUCK: You have any children ? Kelly nods .
KELLY: Her name 's Hannah .
CHUCK: Is that Jango ?
KELLY: No , this is Jack . Jango was hit by a UPS truck . Can you believe it ? Chuck laughs . It is funny , sort of .
CHUCK: Life 's just one big joke after another .
STAN: How about we go somewhere else ?
CHUCK: Want to see my raft ?
STAN: This stinks really bad .
CHUCK: You should have smelled me . Stan examines the ropes around the logs .
STAN: Cool ropes .
CHUCK: I braided them .
STAN: Must have taken a hell of a long time .
CHUCK: Time I had lots of . Kelly points at something on the raft .
KELLY: What 's that ?
CHUCK: That 's my sea anchor . My second one . Made it out of part of the sail . It keeps you from capsizing in a storm . In theory . And this , this I used to collect water . About half a cup a day .
STAN: You were how long on this ?
CHUCK: Forty-three days .
KELLY: All that time I waited to go on a cruise , and you went without me .
CHUCK: Yeah , wellcould n't be helped .
KELLY: What 's that , written on the sail ?
CHUCK: My epitaph .
STAN: I 'll be at the car . Take you to the airport . And he leaves .
KELLY: I buried you , Chuck . They had to pry my fingers off your coffin . This interests Chuck to no end .
CHUCK: There was a coffin ?
KELLY: Yeah , coffin , headstone , the whole thing .
CHUCK: What was inside ?
KELLY: Your calendar , your cell phone , your whoo pig sooey hat , some pictures of that ketch you wanted .
CHUCK: That about sums it up .
KELLY: Maybe now 's when you tell me about it .
CHUCK: The plane went down . My friends died . I washed up on an island . Then I found these barrels , built the raft , and here I am .
KELLY: Yeah ?
CHUCK: The tide came in , the tide went out . I survived . That 's the headline . I survived .
KELLY: Do n't overwhelm me with the details . You know how I hate that .
CHUCK: Cliches , mainly . Do n't take anyone fo granted . Do n't sweat the small stuff . Live each day like it 's your last .
KELLY: So simple to say , so hard to do .
CHUCK: Not when you have no choice . Kelly looks down at the raft . It 's so small .
KELLY: You hated being alone . Could n't stand it . Busy every minute . Always plugged into something .
CHUCK: I did n't know what really being alone was . No one back here does . He has something more to say . She waits .
KELLY: This is so unfair .
CHUCK: That 's what I told the fish I caught . But I ate them anyway .
KELLY: You okay ?
CHUCK: Great . Really .
KELLY: What will you do ?
CHUCK: I do n't know . I really do n't know .
KELLY: I 've got to get back to Memphis . Hannah 's babysitter has finals .
CHUCK: It means a lotthat you came .
KELLY: I had to come . To be sure you were okay . They hold each other . For a long time .
CHUCK: You too .
KELLY: I 'm so glad you 're alive . Chuck grins .
CHUCK: You too .
STAN: When I first showed up , I thought you 'd lost your fucking marbles .
CHUCK: I never thought it would end . Then it did . It was so great to be saved , I could n't stop laughing . Stan pulls a flask out of his bag .
STAN: You need a drink .
CHUCK: For years my only drinking buddy was a soccer ball . Wilson . Stan hoists his glass .
STAN: To Wilson .
CHUCK: To Wilson .
STAN: So , what 's it all about ? Chuck stares at him .
CHUCK: Hallelujah . Stan looks over at him .
STAN: I 'm serious . The burning bush , the big picture , the words in neon
CHUCK: What 's it all about ? It 's about being so thirsty you 'd crush a fish 's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid that 's what it 's about . Stan sits back , repulsed but relieved .
STAN: Do what it takes . That 's what I always told you . He pours another drink .
CHUCK: To life .
STAN: That 's all there is .
CHUCK: Believe me I know .
STAN: Smile . Chuck smiles .

FOX: Maybe there 's a reason he did n't egister . He could have a wooden leg for all we know . Maybe he was born in Peru and he 's not an American

FIDGET: Excuse me , ma'am .
HONEY: Oh , God , I look terrible !
DINAH: Alright , LET 'S LOCK IT UP !
TO HONEY: This is Sprocket House , Miss Whitlock , think of it as your studio .
CECIL: Ca n't you say good morning to Lewis ? He worked hard on this set with a budget of zero .
HONEY: Good morning .
PROUDLY: All these materials were stolen from city-owned construction sitesjust for you ! We 're gon na have a hit , Miss Whitlock !
CECIL: Our picture is called `` Raving Beauty . '' You play the insane owner of a failed art theate who along with her film fanatic oyfriend Lyle . . .Lyle come on over
HONEY: `` Daughter '' ? !
CECIL: .Together , the three of you vow to start a revolution to destroy mainstream cinema
BRAVELY: I can not make this movie ! DINAH quickly hands CECIL a stun-gun .
CECIL: You dare to tell Cecil B. DeMented you refuse !
HONEY: I 'm too young to play her mother !
THREATENINGLY: I know how cid you are
HONEY: It does n't feel right I 'm just not motivated
CECIL: ( Advancing on her with
STUN GUN: How 's this for motivation ? Huh ? CECIL zaps her painfully with the stun gun .
CECIL: There are no creative differences on a Cecil B. DeMented set , Miss Whitlock . Got that ? One day you 'll thank me fo saving you from your bad career .

FURIOUS: Pasolini 's playing and we have an empty theater ? ! DINAH pushes HONEY on stage .
HONEY: It 's that fucking new multiplex that opened in the mall , is n't it ?
CHERISH: I heard they were sold out last night , Mom !
INCREDULOUS: Not for `` THE FLINTSTONES '' ! ?
HONEY: Somebody 's got ta pay fo this insult ! HONEY looks out and sees SPROCKET HOLES aping
NERVOUSLY: From the empty seats of every good movie theater in America..

CECIL: That 's more like it , Miss Whitlock ! CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look .
HONEY: To be frank , Cecil , I would never do this picture in my eal film life . The whole message is stupid - ask theate owners in any country and they 'll tell you . Hollywood makes the est films in the world and I 'm proud to be part of that system .
CECIL: Let 's move on !
SHOCKED: What ? No coverage ?
CECIL: The first take is the only eal truth
HONEY: But you ca n't cut the film with only a master !
CECIL: There are no rules in outlaw cinema , Miss Whitlock , only edges . We believe technique to be nothing more than failed style . You see , I 've had a vision
RODNEY: I see a fucking root already !
HONEY: Owwww ! Please , Cecil . I 'm a much better actress in the studio
CECIL: That 's not what TIME Magazine has to say .
READING: `` Miss Whitlock seems a little ill at ease and past her prime to carry a picture by herself , especially one as sappy and overproduced as `` Some Kind Of Happiness . ''
SHOCKED: TIME Magazine said that ?
LEWIS: Your picture 's gon na lose thirty million dollars .
TO HONEY: Can I ask you a question ? Did you ever fuck Mel Gibson ?
HONEY: Cecil , give yourself up ! It 's not too late
LEWIS: Our film goes into profit the day we sell the first ticket !
PETIE: How big is his dick , anyway ?
HONEY: Come to Hollywood with me and I promise I 'll get you a job as a production assistant on a real Hollywood movie .
CECIL: .and remember there are no ad takes in a Cecil B. DeMented picture - just keep the scene going
LYLE: I never took this much acid
CHERISH: ( Primping with FIDGET 'S help ,
TO HONEY: Do my tits look OK ? They 're igger than yours , you know .
HONEY: Cecil , please do n't make me do this scene
CECIL: Your Hollywood system stole ou sex and co-opted our violence so there 's nothing left for our kind of movies except this !
PAM: Camera rolling .
CHARDONNAY: Speed . DINAH marks the take .
CECIL: ( Aiming his gun at HONEY ,

HONEY: ( To AUDIENCE , ferociously
IN CHARACTER: You do n't have to like this movie !
CHERISH: Come on , Cecil , I want a little `` action '' of my own !
CECIL: I 'm trying to write , Cherish !
TO HONEY: Goat urine , want some ? HONEY pales .
HAPPILY: It 's a Satan thing ! You 're really good in our movie !
FIDGET: Miss Whitlock ?
HONEY: Oh , craft service . Thank you , Fidget , but I neve drink when I 'm working but you 're very kind . Do your parents know where you are tonight ?
FIDGET: They 're probably mad
HONEY: Do n't you think you ought to call them ?
FALTERING: Cecil says our parents are the enemies of film
HONEY: You know that 's nonsense ! Go ahead , call them up . I bet they miss you
LYLE: Hey Honey , want some crack ?
HONEY: I most certainly do NOT , Lyle . I ca n't believe you 'd be a drug addict in the 90 's - it 's so retro .
LYLE: Before I was a drug addict , I had so many different problems , Honey . Now I just have one - drugs . It gave my life a real focus .
CHERISH: How can you see me on film and not want to fuck me ? !
CECIL: I S-Q want to fuck you , Cherish , but you know I ca n't
CHERISH: Why not ? !
PROUDLY: All my directors fuck me !

ALL: Oh , Andy Warhol , we worship you from the new cinema underground HONEY guzzles down the martini .
CECIL: .help us to use our sexual frustrations as you did fo the future of outlaw film !
BELOW HIM: Hey kids ! Wake up ! Let 's make a mother-fucking movie ! He hits hideously loud alarm button .
RODNEY: I see that fucking brown color
HONEY: Please Rodney , those are n't roots - they 're scabs on my scalp from the dye and they 're raw !
SMILING: Just close your eyes and think of the films of George Cukor .
HONEY: OWWWW ! ! Please please Raven , you 're a pretty girl , you could escape this madness
RAVEN: Escape to what , Honey ?
PROUDLY: My father is a Zo-Zo , the three-headed guard dog at the gate of hell !
HONEY: Well I 'm sorry to hear that
RAVEN: And one day I 'm gon na commit evolutionary suicide for celluloid
REALLY SCARED: Do n't say that , Raven ! Tell her , Rodney - no movie is worth dying for ! RODNEY blasts HONEY 's hair with his fiery
HONEY: OWWWW ! Rodney , why do you want to hurt me ? Gay men are supposed to be gentle
RODNEY: That 's just it , Honey ! I 'm not gay . I 'm straight and I fucking hate it ! Petie loves me but I ca n't love him back ! I 've tried ! I kiss him and all I feel is beard .
SOBBING: I 'm so ashamed of my heterosexuality !
COMFORTING HIM: Oh , it 's alright , Rodney .
RODNEY: ( Suddenly snapping back

CECIL: Whatever for ? Your old caree is over . . .but your comeback has just begun
TEENAGE BOY: .I was in the audience when they attacked and I 'll tell you . . .Honey Whitlock was awesome !
TEEN GIRL: I think Honey Whitlock is right - most films suck and it 's time somebody did something about it
THEATER MANAGER: .Nobody forced her to be in that movie , I could see that , ut she was damn good ! Scarie than hell , if you ask me ! She looked different from her othe films , tooI do n't know younger .
CECIL: There are still some people who do n't understand our work
SEETHING: And this is live !
FILM COMMISSIONER: Cecil B. DeMented , the Maryland Film Commission refuses to be intimidated by your pathetic gang of cinematic misfits

TIM: Why were you with him then ?
JOAN: Why ? I do n't know . I do n't know . I guess I probably maybe do n't like myself very much . I do n't know .

BILL KROGSTAD: Tim , Bill Krogstad again . Orin Helgesson told me about your little hootenanny in the pool there .

DEAN: C'mere , kiddo . Sit . Sit down .
TIM: Is this ? Why is this all of a sudden about you , Dean ?
DEAN: I 'm telling you this , buddy , because it shows to go ya even if you 're a fucking waste of space jerk-off like myself , there 's always opportunities to do the right thing . If this Two Diamond bullshit and that matters so much , you 'll find a way to make it ight . If not , fuck it . Life 's way too short to lose sleep over shit that do n't matter .
ORIN: Without any more ado , our keynote speaker , Iowa Insurance Commissioner , Mrs. Susan Voss !
TIM: President Helgesson , please let me stay in the Two Diamond contest . Please . This is n't for me it 's for Bill Krogstad . I ca n't let him down . Please just let me compete . A moment . Orin nods , almost imperceptibly .

ORIN: Suit yourself .
TIM: This is the petition ? Tim shakes his head as he reads the names .
ORIN: Between you and me this was a ploy by Mike Pyle . Trying to drive down the value of Northlands so he could get it on the cheap .
TIM: Oh my gosh , really ? Thank you .
ORIN: One thing Roger Lemke knew , Tim ? He knew that when you get all dolled up , go to the prom the Big Dance that you got ta be prepared to put out . To show a little teat . You ever hear of PayPal , Tim ?
TIM: PayPal ? Um , yeah . I 've used it to pay for Beanie Babies on E-Bay
GUILTY: For my fiancé .
ORIN: Good . Thing you got ta ask yourself now is this `` Am I ready to dance ? Am I ready to show a little TEAT ? ''
TIM: I do n't understand what you mean
ORIN: Calm down , Orin . I 'm sorry . Please , let 's talk E-Commerce for a minute .
TIM: You bet .
ORIN: So Roger 's up here looking ove this new system , and he gets one of these lightbulb-going-off kinda looks , the way he did . And he says , `` Orin , with that newsletter going digital you 're saving almost fou grand a year in printing costs alone . Four grand . Pure profit . '' You see where this is going , Tim ?
TIM: I ca n't say that I do
ORIN: PayPal . That 's where . What has ASMI ever given Orin Helgesson ? Huh ? Not dime one . Sure as shoot not an opportunity to serve on the National Board . Have I not been a good President ? Do I not deserve a little something ?
TIM: You 're an awesome President
ORIN: You 're GODDAMN right I am !
TIM: I 'm still not reading you here
ORIN: There are n't printing costs anymore , see ? The ASMI-teer 's digital . E- Commerce ! Do n't you get it , Tim ? All that money almost 39-hundred dollars a year that goes into a PayPal account now . My PayPal account . But I 've got no idea how to use it .
TIM: Do you literally mean you just need help , like , getting on-line , or ?
ORIN: Your performance in that scavenge hunt was first-rate . Then I see you in the pool making love to that floozy , I realize maybe you 've got a bit of Lemke 's , shall we say , moral ambiguity . I need that .
TIM: You 're talking about stealing .
ORIN: Pontoon boats do n't pay fo themselves , Tim . Roger Lemke came to the prom . He showed me a little teat . I rewarded him with the Two Diamonds three years running . I 'm prepared to do the same for you . What do you say ? You take home those those Two Diamonds , Northlands ' value skyrockets , Bill Krogstad etires to his time share . Everybody wins
TIM: I 'd be doing it for Northlands to keep it in Brown Valley and help my co-workers . To help Bill Tim looks away , avoiding eye contact . Then

TIM: I 'm sorry about Ronald . Just about everything
KAY: Happy Saturday ! What'cha drinkin ' ?
TIM: A large cream sherry , please . As she pours a healthy glass of sherry

TIM: Yeah . I hear that . L & C. Loud and clear .
BREE: Seriously . We 're going to this thing at my Uncle Ken 's later after his shift 's done .
TIM: I have had a pretty messed up day actually . Might not hurt to forget about it for a little while .
ORIN: My advice , Mike ? Pull the trigger . I 've pretty well convinced him that his company 's in the crapper . 85- thousand is as low as I could possibly get him .
MIKE PYLE: He 's said nothing to indicate I 'd have to hang onto his employees o the office up there , right ?
ORIN: Bill was real clear about that . You 're buying his clients not his and . You 've done this before , Mike . The Northlands policies will simply roll over into your Allstate office in Milwaukee . Unless you want to keep a satellite branch up there in North Palookaville .
MIKE PYLE: OK. Let 's pull the trigger .
ORIN: Oh , and Mike we 're square on my consultant 's fee ?
MIKE PYLE: Ten percent , as agreed .
ORIN: Marvelous . Now just give me a second here

JOAN: We used to get bands , Ronald . Real ands . Kansas . REO Speedwagon Remember REO let me get on stage and play tambourine ?
RONALD: I 'll go ahead and admit , this is an odd choice for an ASMI headliner . Budget crunch , I guess .
DEAN: Are you ready for this ? Mike Pyle of Shit just bought Northlands . Word is the cocksucker 's liquidating Timbo and the whole Brown Valley operation .
RONALD: What ? Holy smokes . Does Tim know ?
JOAN: Do n't look at me . I do n't think Tim likes me very much anymore .
DEAN: Cry me a fucking river , honey . This is n't about you for once .
JOAN: Fuck off , Dean . Jackass .
RONALD: Hey . Come on you guys . Cut it out .
DEAN: You two are a couple of serious fucking downers , man . Timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago you saw him Ronimal . Maybe he already knew . Shit , the kid 's one of my best friends
RONALD: You met him two days ago , Ziegler .
DEAN: Know what , blow me Ronald . It 's not my fault you 're too goddamn afraid to open up and tell another man you love him . Do what you want , but the Deanzie 's gon na make sure his friend is doing OK .
TIM: That must be pretty all right , Ken , getting half off at Applebee 's all the time . I 'd only weigh like 10- thousand pounds
UNCLE KEN: Pass me that cube , Skeet .

BREE: Suck the glass dick , dude .
TIM: Oh jeez , oh jeez , oh jeez .
BREE: A butterscotch might help .
DEAN: Trying to reach Tim Lippe . Who am I talking to ?
BREE: JUST GIM ME A HUNDRED .
KAY: Like I say , he was pretty ripped from all that sherry . He left with Ken and them for some party .
DEAN: Who 's Ken ?
KAY: Ken 's our cook . We all think he deals dope , though . I get along good with everyone . But Ken ? He 's just real different .
RONALD: Oh jeez . D'you know where they were going ? Any idea ?
KAY: You could try Ken 's place . It 's way out in the boonies
TIM: My mom became real protective of me after my dad passed . She did n't eally let me play sports or any of that . Fact , if I think about it , I never really did much of anything . Except gardening , which I do enjoy .
BREE: Well you 're livin ' now . Here . She offers Tim a line . He declines .
TIM: Thanks . It 's funny , though , because my job is all about protecting other people 's dreams . But what about my dreams ?
BREE: It could be like maybe Whoa , shit 's tight Like maybe it has to do with your parents both dying ? Like , maybe by protecting other people it 's like you 're trying to save your parents . Like somehow you feel like it 's you fault ? Like in your sub-conscience ?
HUGS TIM: You can fuck my ass if you want .
JOAN: Oh man . This place is bad news .
DEAN: I 'll be standing by ` case things get squirrelly in there . Getaway vehicle type scenario .
JOAN: So you 're sending me into that shithole ? How chivalrous , Dean .

RONALD: Run !
DEAN: What the fuck happened ?
JOAN: Oh my God , Tim . Are you OK ?
TIM: I do n't know . I do n't know . All I know is I was getting kicked and then Ronald was there talking like a ghetto person Dean looks at Joan and Ronald What ?
RONALD: In order to extricate Tim from what was clearly a volatile situation , I did , in fact , rely on my community theater training . I do n't like to ag , but I do a pretty convincing Omar from the HBO program , The Wire . Least them crackers back yonde seemed to buy it .
DEAN: The Ronimal !
TIM: I ca n't believe Bill would do this to me . He was like a father
DEAN: Was n't just Krogstad , Timbo . Orin 's the real devil in this deal . Joan shoots Dean a look shut the fuck up .
JOAN: You 'll find another job , Lippe . Maybe even move to a new town .
RONALD: Shoot , you could come work for me if you wanted .
TIM: I love you , Joan .
JOAN: Get some sleep you guys . I 'll stay up with him make sure he does n't chew his arm off .

BILL KROGSTAD: Sorry , folks . Guess it 's against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business . Must 've missed that constitutional amendment . This draws chuckles from the crowd .
TIM: Insurance is n't just a business , Bill . Insurance is personal . I 've got some savings . I could 've gotten a loan . We could 've worked something out .
BILL KROGSTAD: Yeah , there 's a guy you want unning an agency , is n't it ?

BUSINESS MAN: Have a nice day .
CELESTE: Prick .
RACHEL MADDOW: Sounds utterly hopeless . Is there an upshot ?
CELESTE: I think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity . People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs they will crave mental , spiritual and physical nourishment . It 's back to asics .
RACHEL MADDOW: Wow , a lot to chew on . Well , thanks for being with us today . You 're great , come back any time . For more on this gloomy but interesting subject , look out for trend forecaster , Celeste Martin 's new ook `` Shitegeist , '' on bookshelves Monday .
CELESTE: Thanks so much , Rachel .
SCOTT: Who 's that ?
CELESTE: Tucker and Beth . They 're such dicks . They left in protest because they think Jesse and I are being `` unhealthy . '' So judgy , right ? We 're fine .
SCOTT: You 're only done when you 're done .
CELESTE: Spare me the spiritual platitudes , Scotty . If we were gay , no one would even question us being friends !
SCOTT: You and Jesse are clearly not ready to let each other go . And there 's nothing wrong with that .
CELESTE: Yeah there 's nothing wrong with that . I mean , what do you think ?
SCOTT: Well , to be honest
CELESTE: Wait , we 're signing Riley Banks ? ? When were you going to tell me ? ? I just trashed her on Rachel Maddow . Great .
SCOTT: Yeah , that 's why I wanted you to come in . It 's a huge account..
CELESTE: Scott , you and I built this company so we would n't have to take an account like Riley Banks .
SCOTT: Well , you and I may not have a company if we do n't take Riley Banks . Recession , remember ?
CELESTE: She 's like asoul-less hologram .
SCOTT: She is releasing a new album . She wants us to do the branding and merchandising . We need to take this account .
CELESTE: Ok. Fine . I 'm gon na go eat lunch . Celeste starts to heads out .
SCOTT: If you are looking for my opinion , I do think you should start dating .
CELESTE: I do n't do dating . The right guy will show up . And I 'm still on track for my 25 year plan .
SCOTT: No one has a 25 year plan . Except for my mortgage company .
CELESTE: First child at 33 . Second at 35 . Which means I will only be 56 at my eldest 's college graduation . The ad news is that I may not be at my 4th grandchild 's high school graduation . But that 's okay , I guess .
SCOTT: I 'm fascinated with the mentally ill .
CELESTE: I 've got time . I 'm not worried .
SCOTT: Well , do me a favor and get you fuck on before you meet the next guy . Celeste looks at Scott in shock .
CELESTE: What are you doing ?
SCOTT: Sorry , I was trying to be you saucy gay friend . It did n't feel good .
CELESTE: Yeah do n't .
SKILLZ: The economic climate is real bad , man . And I think my business is taking the hardest hit of all . It 's utal . And no one 's talking about it .
JESSE: You sell pot .
SKILLZ: Not for long , dude . Have you been to those weed pharmacies ? They 're killing me . I got ta branch out . Maybe start working in methamphetamines ? Or maybe teach pre-school . I always wanted to do that . I love kids . Skillz is distracted by something .
JESSE: I do n't think it 's over .
SKILLZ: What ? Her butt ? No , it will neve e over . It goes on forever . It 's like space . So great .
JESSE: No , Celeste and I. I think she 's just confused and overwhelmed right now about everything . But she 'll come around . She always does .
SKILLZ: Uh oh . It 's been a while now . I think it 's over , bro . It may be time to accept that and move on . Call that dime Veronica . Jesse looks uncomfortable .
JESSE: That was a one time thing , a couple months after Celeste and I broke up . Celeste does not know about that . And we will keep it that way .
SKILLZ: Did n't know that was a hit and run . Sounded like you liked her .
JESSE: Well , she 's not Celeste . It 's always been Celeste . I 'm not ready to give up .
SKILLZ: Okay , but remember , you ca n't re- heat a souffle .
JESSE: Huh ?
SKILLZ: Also , there 's Bettys everywhere . It 's LA . Maybe it 's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool . Make her sweat a little bit .
JESSE: It definitely would n't hurt togo out with somebody . They reach the front of the line .
YOGURT GIRL: Do you know what you want ?
JESSE: Yeah , I want to not be a quitter . I do n't want to start all over again . I want everything that I believed to have been true to be true . I also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles . Please .
SKILLZ: Hey , you should go out on a date with my friend here .
YOGURT GIRL: Um , wait , where 's your wife ? You guys are here like everyday together .
JESSE: Wellwe 're separated .
YOGURT GIRL: Oh . Cool . I mean , bummer . But okay . I 'll go .
BETH: It 's sogrotesque .
CELESTE: But kind of beautiful . In a grotesque way .
BETH: Ugh , let 's keep moving . Too many feelings .
CELESTE: Beth , the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he does n't have a checking account . Or dress shoes . The father of my children will have a car . ButJesse will always be my best friend .
BETH: Okay fine . I 've said my peace . It 's your life . But I definitely do n't think he should be living in you guest house . I think you 're kind of eaking his heart . Slowly .
CELESTE: Jesse is fine .
BETH: Can I show you something ?
CELESTE: Sure .
BETH: Okay . Look . She points to her neck .
CELESTE: What am I looking at ?
BETH: It 's a hair . On my NECK .
CELESTE: Ewww . Will you get that thing lasered off , please ? What the fuck ?
BETH: I ca n't because it will pop up somewhere else where I ca n't keep my eye on it .

BETH: Trust me , I know my body . It 's a cruel land mine .
CELESTE: Okay , well at least pluck it fo Chrissake .
BETH: I should , at least before my wedding , right ?
CELESTE: What is wrong with you ? Celeste grabs the hair and pulls it out .
BETH: AHHHHHHHHHH ! A security guard heads for them .
CELESTE: Sorry sir , my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art .
BETH: That was fucking rude .
CELESTE: Had to be done .
JESSE: Yeah .
CELESTE: God , you really love that , do n't you ?
JESSE: Matthias ' wife died in a ca accident last year .

You bought a Samsung cell phone because you think it makes you seem more `` business-oriented , '' unlike the iPhone which is fo teenage girls .

JESSE: Yeah , and I was never your equal . And you know what ? I think you preferred it that way .
CELESTE: Right . Well , I know my success was never easy for you .

JESSE: What do you want ?
CELESTE: I just want you to admit that you 're wrong !
JESSE: Wrong ? Wrong about what ? What did you want me to do ? Wait for you to meet someone first ? Is that how you saw it happening ? Celeste does n't respond .

JESSE: I feel really sorry for you . You might be alone forever .
CELESTE: Do n't ever call me .

CELESTE'S LAWYER: One more here .

CELESTE: We did it .
JESSE: You wan na walk for a couple minutes ?

CELESTE: What ? Veronica ? Left where ?
JESSE: Left me . She wanted me to tell he everything was gon na be okay and I could n't . I do n't know why but I justcould n't . She wants to go ack to Brussels .
CELESTE: Heydo n't do that .
JESSE: Do what ?
CELESTE: You are not a loser . You neve were . You took a chance . I admire that and I believe in you .
JESSE: You do ?
CELESTE: I do . And I want to thank you .
JESSE: For what ?
CELESTE: For never being the person I wanted you to be .
JESSE: Oh , you 're welcome .
CELESTE: Go get her .
JESSE: But I do n't know if everything is gon na be all right .
CELESTE: Well , who does ? Do you love her ? Jesse looks at Celeste .
JESSE: I do .
CELESTE: Then it 's worth fighting for .
JESSE: Okay . Okay . Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes .
CELESTE: God , I finally understand why you fucking cry all the time . Shit is emotional .
JESSE: Me too .
CELESTE: SoI guess we were right .
JESSE: Huh ?
CELESTE: I love you too .
YOUNG MAN: Hey , I 'm sorry for cutting . My dog 's in the car and he 's really thirsty . So , thanks .
CELESTE: No problem . She smiles again . The world feels bigger now .
CATHERINE: Thanks for the horse .
EDWARD: You liked him ?
CATHERINE: He 's beautiful Edward smiles , delighted he made her happy .
EDWARD: 's broken .
CATHERINE: Who says ?
EDWARD: Mocky-Lock .
CATHERINE: Oh no No you do n't .
EDWARD: `` Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman . Mocky-Lock wants me where I am . ''
CATHERINE: I bet we can fix it .
MIRIAM: Sing a song of sixpence
CATHERINE: A pocketful of rye
HENRY: `` Mister E. '' is doing fine .
MIRIAM: Did we go sailing ?
CATHERINE: Almost . Mocky-Lock showed up .
MIRIAM: `` Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman , Mocky-Lock wants me where I am . ''
CATHERINE: Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass .
HENRY: Where did that come from again ?
CATHERINE: A nursery rhyme .
MIRIAM: Nursery rhymes , fairy tales , the ogeyman All preparation for the horrors of the real world .
HENRY: Anybody hungry ? I 'm hungry
COOPERMAN: Edward 's parents are here .
ELLA: He needs a haircut .
CATHERINE: I 'll tell the nurse . God , he loves when you visit .
ELLA: My husband wonders if that 's true . He wants to place Edward in a hospital .
HENRY: There are other applications for the scanner , Mr. Baines
LUCIEN: I realize that , Henry And I know your work , Dr. Kent , is invaluable to this company
CATHERINE: You do n't know about me , though , do you ?
LUCIEN: Catherine , we 've waited eighteen months for signs of progress
CATHERINE: There 's been progress .
LUCIEN: Yes , but there is no proof the procedure works . All I have is a belief that you interaction with my son is not a hallucination .
CATHERINE: You picked me , remember ? And I took the job . Gladly . This is the next wave and I want to be part of it
COOPERMAN: No one is doubting your ability .
CATHERINE: Then what is it ?
LUCIEN: I 've invested millions of dollars in this study And I 've convinced others to do the same . I suppose I should feel esponsible to them , but I do n't . I could care less if they see a profit . I 'm responsible to my boy , that 's all that matters . You tell me Am I doing the right thing ?
ANNE: Thirty .
MIRIAM: You okay ?
CATHERINE: He hates me .
MIRIAM: Lucien Baines ? Catherine nods .
CATHERINE: She thinks I can bring Edward back .
MIRIAM: Someday you can . We all believe that
CATHERINE: I want to try it . Please . Miriam knows what this is about .
MIRIAM: We 've been over this a dozen times . No .
CATHERINE: Why not ? Just once . A trial run . What harm could it do ?
MIRIAM: I do n't want to find out .
CATHERINE: Why is it taking so long for us to reach him ? Because we 've been reactive , that 's why . And we need to be active .
MIRIAM: Shush . As Miriam examines her , Catherine continues
CATHERINE: He creates the obstacles , he decides which games to play .
MIRIAM: I 've heard this argument before . It 's not happening .
CATHERINE: It could take years for me to get past the barriers he 's created .
MIRIAM: If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind , it could be devastating for him . Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world .
CATHERINE: I do it all the time !
MIRIAM: Yes , but , you 're a willing participant . Picture Edward in a strange place , lost , frightened
CATHERINE: I 'd be there for him .
MIRIAM: And he might blame you for terrifying him . That one moment could erase all you 've accomplished . And if that happened , the trust he has in you is gone .
CATHERINE: Okay , okay
MIRIAM: Besides , I do n't know what it might do to you . You 're already exhausted . Have you been sleeping ? Catherine nods .
CATHERINE: No .
MIRIAM: Good . We need you healthy and relaxed . You 're going to eat well , meditate , exercise , and watch mindless television .
CATHERINE: Yes mother .
MIRIAM: I do n't want you up all night reading Edward 's case file of the nine millionth time . Balance , dear girl , is the key . Leave the work here . She taps Catherine 's head .
CATHERINE: Okay . Miriam gathers her belongings .
MIRIAM: Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he 's wild about . Want to come ?
CATHERINE: I 've got to feed my cat . Besides , I want to get to bed early .
MIRIAM: That 's my girl .
CATHERINE: Pleasant dreams , Mister E .
RAMSEY: Who found her ?
COLE: Surveyor for the railroad 'Bout six this morning .
NOVAK: Thanks for waiting , Teddy .
TEDDY LEE: Bleach .
NOVAK: Anne Marie Vicksey . We recognize her , too .
COLE: She the one from Santa Cruz ?
NOVAK: Just graduated law school . Single mom . Had a two-year-old daughter .
TEDDY LEE: Someone looking after her little girl ?
NOVAK: Grandparents . Live over in Davis .
TEDDY LEE: The poor thing .
RAMSEY: Well , honey , what 's worse ? Doing it yourself or asking your mother for help ? Can it wait 'til I get back I have no idea , Jeannie .
NOVAK: How is she ?
RAMSEY: Pregnant . Thanks for asking .
NOVAK: Here he is .
RAMSEY: Damn , man , I give up . Your partne tells you his wife 's gon na have a baby , and all you care about is a coroner 's eport !
TEDDY LEE: Hot off the presses .
RAMSEY: More hair . I could knit this guy a toupee .
TEDDY LEE: So ?
NOVAK: Anne Vicksey did n't own a dog . Ramsey checks his copy .
TEDDY LEE: Now ?
NOVAK: Now .
TEDDY LEE: Complete absence of melanin . Novak and Ramsey stand over his shoulder .
RAMSEY: And that means ?
NOVAK: The dog 's an albino . He 'd love an animal like that .
TEDDY LEE: Gentlemen , I believe an albino dog is are indeed .
JULIA: Oh no
STARGHER: Good boy .
NOVAK: Donna Krozin . Helen Francis , Teresa Manicki The chatter dies .
RAMSEY: A purebred German Shepherd .
NOVAK: Nicole Labetzki . Victim seven . Forensics found dog hair in her car , but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked .
TEDDY LEE: The Phoenix office tested that hai thirty minutes ago . And we got the match .
NOVAK: It 's his dog . Ramsey holds up a thick list .
RAMSEY: Registered breeders of German Shepherds .
NOVAK: Be thorough , but be fast . This guy 's accelerating . He only waited six days this last time . When he started , two months could pass .
DISTORTED VOICE: Me god feed on pain . The VOICE echoing inside his skull .
RAMSEY: She was still living at home ?
MR. HICKSON: Yes , sir .
JOHN: We were looking at apartments .
MR. HICKSON: But nobody was moving in together 'til after the wedding .
RAMSEY: John , you came to pick her up when ?
JOHN: Eight o'clock . We were going out for my irthday .
MR. HICKSON: Maybe you made a mistake . Maybe she she Novak hides the doll .
RAMSEY: No sir . I 'm sorry .
NOVAK: After three years she remembers what the guy drove ?
RAMSEY: She remembers because it was her `` dream truck . '' Wanted one just like it .
STOCKWELL: Ramsey , Novak ?
NOVAK: Where is he ?
STOCKWELL: Edison . Just east of Loma Park . SWAT 's had the house under surveillance fo about twenty minutes . Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher . No egistered weapons , no priors . Got a license for his dog , though . Named him Valentine
NOVAK: You 're the bad man , are n't you , Carl ?
BROCK: Glad you could make it . We lose the sun in half an hour .
NOVAK: Have they seen him ?
BROCK: No . There 's been movement in the kitchen . But it could be the dog . You think she 's in there ? Novak is careful with his answer .
NOVAK: We proceed assuming she is .
RAMSEY: Let 's give old Carl a call . Tell him he 's got company .
NOVAK: No . Can you get a man close ?
ERICSON: I 'm at the back door .
NOVAK: Go .
ERICSON: FBI !
NOVAK: Paramedics . NOW . Ramsey pushes through and Novak informs him .
STOCKWELL: They 'll take him to County General . Reid 's already there .
NOVAK: Make sure he stays cuffed . Two men on him at all times . I do n't want anyone treating him but Reid . Not so much as a thermometer up his ass . Understand ?
RAMSEY: She 's not here .
JULIA: Hey !
REID: Minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . And here , the anterior cingulate cortex . It 's what helps distinguish between external and internal stimuli .
RAMSEY: What the hell does that mean ?
TEDDY LEE: He 's schizophrenic . Novak does n't like this . Not one bit .
RAMSEY: What 're you doing here , Reid ? Paving the way for his insanity defense ?
REID: No need . There wo n't be a trial . This is no act . The coma is real .
RAMSEY: Whoa . Wait a minute .
REID: You ever hear of Whalen 's Infraction ? Clearly not .
TEDDY LEE: What about Thorazine ? Or Desoxyn ?
REID: The normal psychotropics do n't work . He 's not just catatonic , he 's disappeared . Like having a dream and never waking up .
NOVAK: This girl . Julia Hickson . Only he knows where she is .
REID: Then I 'm sorry . For her and for you .
RAMSEY: We 'll go back to his house , Pete . There 's still a lot to do . Analyze the videos , track sales of the bleach , go through his records . Maybe he owns property somewhere .
NOVAK: They 're in that fucking thing for forty hours , Gordon . Four-oh . He got Julia at seven-thirty last night . You know what time it is now ? !
REID: Peter ? This is a longshot . I mean a eal long shot . You 're gon na think I 'm crazy
CATHERINE: I 'm not signalling !
MIRIAM: Sing a song of sixpence .
CATHERINE: A pocketful of fucking rye . What 's wrong ?
MIRIAM: Nothing .
CATHERINE: Why did we stop ? Cooperman appears in the window and explains .
COOPERMAN: I asked them to . We have a situation .
MIRIAM: When did he lapse into the coma ?
NOVAK: Sometime yesterday morning .
COOPERMAN: John and Ella Baines - as well as the Sunerset Board of Directors - have given their approval , but the decision is yours .
MIRIAM: What about the legalities of this ?
NOVAK: Stargher is in custody . The functional equivalent of being under arrest . Normally , we 'd Mirandize him , and if he did n't lawyer up , we 'd interrogate him . But because of his condition , he does n't have the capacity to waive those rights .
HENRY: So what you 're asking us to do is illegal ?
NOVAK: No , not at all . We 're dealing with exigent circumstances . Somewhere there 's a kidnapped woman still alive . If we weigh the suspect 's Constitutional Rights against the public safety . The Law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway . It 's called the Public Safety Exception .
COOPERMAN: So what can you do ?
NOVAK: Pretty much anything we want . There 's a chance to save a human life . Because of that , Stargher has no reasonable expectation of privacy .
CATHERINE: What if ? All eyes turn to her .
NOVAK: As far as I needed .
CATHERINE: Do you think he 'd tell you what you need to know ?
NOVAK: There 's always a chance they 'll confess .
CATHERINE: Really ? I do n't work with violent cases , I work with children . But even a kid lies . They love it when they get you to believe something that is n't true . Do n't you think Stargher would do the same ?
NOVAK: Sometimes Once they 've been caught they feel a need for disclosure . They have so much they want to tell . But they 've never had a sympathetic ear . They need someone to understand why . Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully . It was part of the ritual . Some were n't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean . But these last three They were still in water - always in water - but Listen , he was n't just careless . It went beyond that
CATHERINE: Okay . Let 's assume he wanted you to find him , that some part of him hated what he was doing Most likely , that part is dead . Schizophrenics with Whalen 's Infraction sever all ties with the real world . I 'm sorry , I really am .
RAMSEY: Is it possible ?
CATHERINE: If he came to trust me , yes , but it takes months to build that kind of trust . Someone like Stargher ca n't distinguish between fantasy and reality . It 's all the same . He might tell me she 's in Timbuktu and absolutely , one hundred percent believe it to be true , ut she 's
FBI TECH: Quantico . San Diego Field Office . S.D. , L.A. , and San Francisco P.D . California , Arizona , Nevada State Police . Nine and ten are open lines . Direct link to the chopper . That gets you into the Bureau Database .
NOVAK: Thanks .
RAMSEY: You sure you want to go through with this ?
NOVAK: What else do we do ? !
RAMSEY: I do n't know , Pete , but for god 's sake This is nuts . Do you really understand what they 're going to do ?
NOVAK: I do n't have to .
RAMSEY: Why jeopardize what we 've already done ? We caught the sonofabitch . Carl Stargher . That 's going to be like Bundy , Gacy , Dahmer . A case that makes careers . But if we push our luck . If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it .
NOVAK: Tell you what . If this thing burns us , I take that heat . I give you permission to point your finger at me and say `` It was all his idea . ''
RAMSEY: That 's not what I 'm talking about , Pete . I 'm talking about waking up and ealizing this girl 's gon na die . The words are anathema to Novak .
NOVAK: That wo n't happen .
COOPERMAN: They 're ready .
HENRY: Should n't we get a catheter in him ?
MIRIAM: They took care of that , thank you , Henry .
HENRY: Gentlemen , you stand before the one and only Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System .
NOVAK: I still do n't understand why I ca n't do this This is n't some `` troubled kid '' you 're dealing with .
CATHERINE: I realize that
NOVAK: How hard could it be ?
CATHERINE: The first What ? Six or seven times I went in . Remember what happened ?
MIRIAM: Disorientation , nausea , migraines , hallucinations , insomnia , paranoia .
CATHERINE: Like a New Year 's Day hangover .
MIRIAM: He needs to be turned over .
NOVAK: This man is deeply disturbed , he
CATHERINE: You do n't know the procedure .
NOVAK: I know him .
MIRIAM: That may be true , but you do n't have Catherine 's gift . She What happened here ? We see a series of EIGHT BANDAGES .
RAMSEY: We removed eight metal rings .
CATHERINE: Then he should like this .
HENRY: Do n't touch that , please .
RAMSEY: Sorry .
MIRIAM: This is n't your responsibility . Remember that . Do n't let them use guilt as a tool . If you want to stop , say so .
CATHERINE: I 'll be fine .
MIRIAM: She said convincingly .
NOVAK: That 's the stuff ?
HENRY: About twelve years of research , right Miriam ?
MIRIAM: Do n't remind me .
RAMSEY: What is it - are they - exactly ?
MIRIAM: Psychostimulants , serotonin , stabilizers , meprobamate , Neurontin , lithium carbonate . And my baby . It duplicates and expands upon the effects of a chemical called oxytocin , forcing a eak in the neuron connections that hold experience . So new experience can form .
HENRY: There 's a touch-sensitive microchip implanted in her hand . If she becomes frightened , disoriented , or simply wants to end the session , she signals us to abort .
MIRIAM: Although none of what she experiences is eal , she can be tricked into thinking it is . The mind is awfully gullible , so she needs to monitor herself .
CATHERINE: No . No .
NOVAK: You said she has a `` gift . ''
HENRY: Not a gift . A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex , that 's all . A genetic fluke .
MIRIAM: Catherine has a tremendous capacity fo empathy . When we started , there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as `` receivers . '' All they did was observe and report . Nothing more . But Catherine , she had the ability to feel what was happening . She understood . And the patient responded . Edward engaged her in dialogue , took he places , showed her things . He knew she cared .
CATHERINE: Hello ?
STARGHER KING: Where you come from priddy thing ?
NOVAK: What happened ?
HENRY: Must 've been rather unusual .
RAMSEY: What happens here ?
HENRY: We do n't talk about that .
NOVAK: What happens ?
HENRY: Well , Theoretically , while she 's inside . If she came to believe that Stargher 's world is her world , her mind has the power to convince the body that anything done to it is , um , actually done . Novak does n't like the sound of that .
MIRIAM: Pump in two liters of pure oxygen , please Henry .
NOVAK: Dr. Kent ?
MIRIAM: Deep breaths .
CATHERINE: Is it cold in here ?
MIRIAM: What happened ? No response .
NOVAK: I 'll get her
CATHERINE: Do you think that 's funny ?
NOVAK: No . Not at all . From what I understand , he knows I '' m here , is n't that right ?
CATHERINE: It does n't have much to do with science .
NOVAK: What then ?
CATHERINE: The soul . The spirit . Whatever you want to call it .
NOVAK: Ah , the part of us that ca n't be explained .
CATHERINE: Agent Novak ?
NOVAK: Peter , okay ?
CATHERINE: Do you feel there 's a side of yourself you do n't show people ?
NOVAK: Absolutely . I suppose everyone does .
CATHERINE: Just like we all have fantasies , right ? Things only we know , that we do n't share .
NOVAK: That 's what therapists are for , right ?
CATHERINE: During the sessions . When I 'm inside . I see those things . What a person hides , what they despite , what they want to control . With Stargher This is difficult for her .
NOVAK: What did you see ?
CATHERINE: A kingdom . His utopia . Life without consequence or restriction . He 's not even Carl Stargher anymore . He 's this idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases Without fear . A horrible primitive ugly thing . I do n't want to talk in here . She kisses Edward 's forehead and exits .
NOVAK: You 're the shrink , you tell me .
CATHERINE: As soon as I met him , you knew I 'd say yes . He makes Julia real for me . Novak nods . Guilty .
NOVAK: It 's an old lawyer trick . Target the emotions . Do it right , you get a eluctant witness to testify , a scared kid to confess .
CATHERINE: You thought Stargher wanted to be caught .
NOVAK: I did , yeah .
CATHERINE: You were right . There 's a part of him that knows the truth . About what he did , about himself . Novak 's curiosity is piqued .
NOVAK: What about Julia ?
CATHERINE: This is going to sound terrible , but I do n't think she matters anymore . Not to him . He never finished her . The othershe was able to make them his .
NOVAK: You think you can do this , do n't you ?
CATHERINE: He might tell me about Julia . The part of him that wants to help , that feels shame and remorse . Who wants to be edeemed .
NOVAK: This is Stargher we 're talking about ?
CATHERINE: Not Stargher , not really . He 's split himself right down the middle . Good/evil , right/wrong , merciful/cruel . A monster . And an innocent child . If I could reach the boy .
NOVAK: Whoa . Hold on . Are n't they the same guy ?
CATHERINE: Do n't you feel there are different sides to every personality ? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act . We 're all human .
NOVAK: It 's hard for me to see Stargher as human , capable of something like `` remorse . ''
CATHERINE: Then what is he ?
NOVAK: Evil .
CATHERINE: If you believe that .
NOVAK: Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time .
CATHERINE: What happened to Charles Gish ? Novak does n't respond . She prods him .
NOVAK: What difference does it make ?
CATHERINE: Tell me . God , he does not want to do this .
NOVAK: Right after the trial , the night afte he was released . Mr. and Mrs. Frank Simmons found Charlie sitting in thei living room watching TV with thei twelve-year old daughter Margaret . He 'd cut her right down the middle with a carving knife .
CATHERINE: You 're sure of that ?
NOVAK: Yes . I am . Catherine realizes that was a confession .
RAMSEY: Next time , tell me , okay ?
NOVAK: But you looked so cute . All sleepy
RAMSEY: Your colleagues want to know what to do with Stargher .
CATHERINE: Tell them to prep him . And that I 'll be ight there . Ramsey nods and heads back to the lab .
NOVAK: Thank you .
CATHERINE: I need something .
MIRIAM: I hate to admit it , but there 's something perversely satisfying about this .
HENRY: I think that 's the whole point .
NOVAK: Remember , Julia Hickson is priority number one . Nothing else matters . Find out where she is .
CATHERINE: Okay , okay
CATHERINE: Valentine ?
MARTIN: What did you do know ? You make a mess ? I hate a mess .

CATHERINE: You sound like your father . He gets close to her face and sneers .
STARGHER: I am not like him .
CATHERINE: Then help me . Where is Julia Hickson ?
STARGHER: Why ?
CATHERINE: Maybe , because you want to .
STARGHER: Is that right ? You think you know me ?
HENRY: Miriam
STARGHER KING: Now shud you mouth , priddy thing , or me god slice you from the kunt to the tits .
MIRIAM: Son of a bitch !
NOVAK: When we got here , you just topped and pulled her out .
MIRIAM: That was with Edward . She 's accustomed to his world . Stargher 's mind is unfamiliar territory . She 's `` lost . '' Someone has to go in . Remind her what 's really happening . And get her out . Until then , she 's at his mercy . Mercy . Novak 's mind reels .

NOVAK: I am . I 'm a pretty boring guy .
MIRIAM: I doubt that .
HENRY: We should hurry .
MIRIAM: The first five minutes will be disorienting . Give yourself time . Let the drugs do the work . If you can see , smell , feel , hear , taste things - you 're on the right track . Once you 've acclimated , try to get a feeling fo Catherine . Instinct plays a huge role in this . Trust it .
MOTHER TWO: My child is an abomination . He is damned . He has no soul .

JULIA: Do something , Julia .
RAMSEY: Pete , listen to me . What did you really learn in there ? Anything new ? You eally think Stargher gave you a save the-day clue ? What if this is all some kind of trick your head is playing on you ?
HENRY: there was a moment when we thought we 'd lost Agent Novak as well .
MIRIAM: What 's wrong ?
HENRY: It would take hours to re-route the system , and even if I did , I should n't .
RAMSEY: What are you talking about ?
MIRIAM: She 's done it . Stupid , stupid girl
RAMSEY: Done what ?
HENRY: Instead of going into his mind

CATHERINE: Everything 's alright now , Valentine . I promise .
COLE: Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano . Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it 's just sitting there .
NOVAK: Delano ?
COLE: Yep . And guess who they hired to seal up the place ?
NOVAK: You 're kidding me .
COLE: I never kid . My wife hates it . Says I 'm too serious . Novak locates Delano on the map .

DAVE: This hot paralegal in my office .
MITCH: Is she on your Cancer List ?
DAVE: What 's a Cancer List ?
MITCH: Do n't all married dudes have a Cancer List ? No ? Like the first three chicks you would bang if you wife suddenly died of cancer ?
DAVE: That 's sick , man . Jamie is the mother of my children
DISGUSTED: But yes , if I had a Cancer List , Sabrina would be the first on it .
MITCH: Who 's number two ? Fergie ?
DAVE: Just finish your story , man ! I 'm dying over here !

MITCH: Ah , it 's not always like that
DAVE: I do n't know whyI do n't know why I 've always been in such a rush , you know ?
BURRRRP: do you mean ?
DAVE: You remember me in high school , I was always so focussed on getting into a good college , then when I got to college , I was so focussed on getting into a good law school , then in law school I was just trying to land a job at a good firm , then Jamie and I got married and we had Cara right away I just feel like and I missed out on all the fun stuff , you know ? The sex , the drugs , the bad choices , and now it 's too late . I blew it . I pissed away my 20 's , and now I 'm staring down the barrel a seriously boring life .
MITCH: Oh come on , Jamie is hot !
DAVE: No , I know
MITCH: I really want to have sex with her !
DAVE: Wait , what ?
MITCH: And your kids are adorable ! They 're like fun little puppies that talk !
DAVE: Do n't get me wrong , I love my kids , I do , I would take a bullet fo them , butremember that heroin addict you dated ?
MITCH: Tara ? Or Rena ? Or Rachel ?
DAVE: Jesus , how many heroin addicts have you dated ?
MITCH: It 's a national scourge , dude .
DAVE: Anyway . Having kids is like dating a heroin addict , only instead of dating them , they move into you house for 18 years . They 're laughing one second and crying the next and then they 're trying to kill themselves in your bathroom for no reason . They 're mean and selfish and they burn through all your money and they steal your shit and they break everything and they stay up all night and they listen to really shitty music and the dirty secret is , no one actually likes kids .
MITCH: Oh come on , you do n't mean that
DAVE: No ! It 's true . Everyone pretends to like kids because if you do n't you look like a huge dick . It 's like Drew Barrymore or jazz . No one actually likes them , but if you say that out loud , everybody hates you .
MITCH: Dude , I love Drew Barrymore have you seen Boys on the Side ?
DAVE: I 'm just saying do n't fuck up you life like I did , okay ?
MITCH: What are you talking about ? You 've got it all ! You 've got a huge house full of food and furniture shit , your TV is bigger than my car ! You have a great job , you make a shit- ton of money , and people respect you , man ! My last job involved an ape costume do you know what that does to a man ?
DAVE: Wait , what ?
MITCH: Also you 're never lonely , you always have someone to talk to about your day , plus you get to do all the fun gay couple stuff like go to wine country ! You think single guys can go to wine country ? ! No way ! They wo n't even let us in ! You 're living the dream , dude ! What more do you want ? !
DAVE: Tatiana ! I want Tatiana ! I want sex with strange new women and maybe also with Sabrina if she 's single and I want to wake up at noon and smoke weed all afternoon and I want to not think about the needs of four other people 24 hours a day and I want to start reading a novel and actually finish it and I want to take a solid shit because I 'm not constantly stressed out and I want to learn how to rollerblade and also I really want to pee
MITCH: Yeah , me too
DAVE: Bingo .
MITCH: This chick does not look happy .
DAVE: Maybe she has three kids and a jo she hates .
MITCH: Dude , enough already .
DAVE: I 'm just sayingI envy your life .
MITCH: And that 's what 's so fucked , ecause I envy yours .

MITCH: Excuse me ! Where is the fountain ? !
FOREMAN: It 's getting restored .
DAVE: Where did you take it ? !
FOREMAN: I do n't know , chief , I 'm not the fountain spokesman , I 'm just the guy that fills the fucking hole .
DAVE: Who could tell us where it is ? !
FOREMAN: Maybe the district manager ?
MITCH: Well of course it 's not !
DAVE: When will it be in the computer ? !
MITCH: How can you lose a fountain ? .

DAVE: Marty Green , the producer of Busted Dreams 4 . Apparently the guy they cast for Steve Action OD 'd last night , and the back-up actor got deported , so , alphabetically , you 're the next actor on the list . You got the part , man .
MITCH: Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Dreams really do come true !
REALIZING: Wait , no , this sucks ! I 'm stuck in your fat dad-body ! I ca n't play Steve Action looking like this !
DAVE: Oh my God and I 've got my closing today .
MITCH: What , is that like a big deal ?
DAVE: A big ? ! Yeah ! Whether or not I make partner is riding on this !
MITCH: So what the hell are we gon na do ? PANICKED SILENCE . Then Mitch looks at Dave
DAVE: No . No . We ca n't just be each othe for a day , Mitch ! You have no idea how to be a lawyer !
MITCH: Dude , I 'm an actor , a human chameleon , I can do lawyer in my fucking sleep ! It 's you I 'm worried about you ca n't act for shit !
DAVE: First of all , it 's Busted Dreams 4 , okay ? It 's not The Reader . Second of all , I 'm a WASP , I 've spent my entire life acting happy and no one has ever questioned my performance , okay ? ! They look at each other , cooling off a bit
MITCH: I mean , we have toright ?
DAVE: All right , well , my meeting starts in 45 minutes . You need to race home , get dressed , then go to my office and find my secretary Gladys-
MITCH: She sounds hot , is she hot ?
DAVE: No . Get the merger docs from Gladys and take them to the conference oom . All the partners will be there so do not speak to anyone .
MITCH: Really ? Because I can vamp
DAVE: NO ! No vamping ! And once the meeting starts , you will continue to say nothing . When a partner asks you for the merger documents , you will silently hand them over , okay ?
MITCH: Dude , I get it . Play it big , but maintain my reality
DAVE: No ! Play it small . Really small . I 've spent the last nine months anging out the terms of this deal , all you have to do is hand over the documents . That 's it .
MITCH: Dude , that 's easy as fuck . Okay , for me , go home , put on some cool clothes , and get to set all the info is on my phone .

MITCH: Holy dick , are you Gladys ? You 're a lynx .
GLADYS: W-What is a lynx ?

GLADYS: Here are your merger documents ! Good day to you ! She storms off . Mitch calls after her
MITCH: Hey , where 's my meeting at ?
MITCH: What up , white people ? ! Republican Party in the house , am I right ? ! Come on , let 's get started !

MITCH: Fuck verbal resolution ! Put that whore on her back and shank her ! Do you know how to make a shiv ?
CARA: What ?
MITCH: Listen to me , kid the world is a cesspool of cruelty and violence . If someone comes at you with a knife , you got ta put their entire fucking family in the morgue , okay ? That 's called jailyard justice . Because if you do n't come back hard on a bitch , your ass is gon na get sold for a pack of Camel Lights and a jello cup , y'understand ? Always solve your problems with violence . Always . Cara nods , alarmed .
CARA: O-Okay Daddy ?
DAVE: I dry-humped a stranger 's leg fo three hours today
MITCH: Cry me a river , dude I dealt with allet and your ass-hat boss today .
DAVE: Oh no what happened at work ?
MITCH: Nothing ! Nothing . I fixed it . Okay , but look , it was not my fault ! The Japs started peppering me with questions and I had to improvise and then everyone got very emotional and , well it looks like we 're going to court .

JAMIE: Great ! Sounds like a plan .
MITCH: Are you kidding ? Is she kidding ?
DAVE: Baby , please do n't

MITCH: I think you should fuck her , that 's what I think you should do .
DAVE: But would n't I besort of cheating on Jamie ? Maybe ?
MITCH: No ! Cheating is when any part of your penis touches any part of another woman who is not your wife , and last I checked , your wang is safely tucked away in my incredibly lame triple-pleated sport slacks .
DAVE: But my mind is over here , does n't that count somehow ?
MITCH: Dude , how many women have you fucked in your mind ? Thousands ?
DAVE: Millions .
MITCH: Right , and that 's not cheating , ight ?
DAVE: Your reasoning is oddly impeccable .
MITCH: I think you 're on firm legal ground here , amigo . I say jump that ass .
DAVE: Jesus I have n't had sex with another woman since college
MITCH: Well , it still works the same , but this chick is a lot to handle so pace yourself , okay ? She 's hornie than a priest at summer camp .
DAVE: Oh my God so am I .

MITCH: Yes Jamie I 'm sorry Jamie !
DAVE: Oh come on What ?
MITCH: I always thought your wife was a nice lady but she is neither nice nor a lady ! She talks like a dock- worker and she shits like one too ! Plus I used to think your kids were adorable but actually they 're just eally fucking annoying and crazy needy Wait , are you jacking off ?
DAVE: What ? No !
MITCH: So why are you panting ?
DAVE: Look , I had to , I never get this kind of privacy anymore .
MITCH: But is n't that sort ofmy penis ? Dave looks down .

MITCH: So what , she 's having a girl ! It would n't have been a little boy tickling your tip ! Jesus , I ca n't elieve you fucked up my Tuesday night regular !
DAVE: Relax , Mitch
MITCH: No ! You married guys have no idea how hard it is to build a reliable stable ! You do n't ! It 's a full time job ! Getting girls ' phone numbers , calling them , emailing them , Facebooking them , Twittering them , uying them drinks and dinners and coffees and listening to endless stories about their stupid fucking friends and begging them to touch your wiener on the second date and uilding an elaborate web of lies so they do n't all find out about each other it 's exhausting ! And then poof ! In one night , you just casually discard my life 's work !
DAVE: Jesus , okay , I 'm sorry
MITCH: Sorry does n't lick my ballbag every Tuesday night
DAVE: Look , is there a reason you 're calling me at 3 in the morning ?
MITCH: Yeah , your mean wife is making me feed the kids . What do I do ?
DAVE: Have you changed their diapers already ?
MITCH: Yes . Obviously .
DAVE: Okay , take them to the kitchen .
MITCH: Hold on .
DAVE: Go to the fridge
MITCH: Yeah ?
DAVE: Defrost two bags of breastmilk in the microwave for 3 minutes , then prepare two separate bottles
MITCH: Holy fuck !
DAVE: What was that ?
MITCH: Nothing ! Go on ! Two bottles ?
DAVE: First attach the filter to the seal to the nipple
MITCH: Oh jesus oh jesus
DAVE: I know , right ? And make sure you do n't allow any air bubbles in .
MITCH: Dude . Listen to me you need to go downtown first thing tomorrow morning and you need to find that fucking fountain
DAVE: Great . So where 's the fountain ?
JAMIE: Dave 's in the shower .
DAVE: Are you okay ?
EXHALES: It 's Dave he 's been acting so strange lately . Last night Last night he even told me he was n't attracted to me
DAVE: Oh my god I 'm going to fucking kill him .
JAMIE: Just tell me honestlyis Dave having an affair ?
DAVE: No . Jamie . I swear he 's not . You 're just going through a very temporary ough patch , okay ?
JAMIE: Temporary ? We 've been in this rough patch for years
DAVE: Y-You have ? !
JAMIE: You do n't want to hear about this .
DAVE: No I really do . Tell me everything .
JAMIE: It 's not his fault , reallyI love him with all my heart , you know I do , but-you remember Dave 's family growing up . They were a mess . They had nothing . Dave 's entire childhood was spent looking over the fence , wanting a bette life . So he scrimped and saved and worked four jobs at once and put himself through school and built a etter life for himself . I 've always loved that about him .
DAVE: well poor Jamie ! You have an ambitious , hard-working husband who provides for you and your family how can you even stand it ?
TAKEN ABACK: No , I know , I should be grateful and I amI guess all I 'm saying is that Dave is so focussed on what he does n't have that he ca n't see what he does . And how long can you stay married to someone who is incapable of ever being happy ?
MITCH: Check it out I have freckles on my taint ! How awesome is that ? !
DAVE: It means we might be in each other 's bodies for a while
MITCH: What ? ! No ! I ca n't do this anymore ! Your life sucks !
DAVE: My life sucks ? ! You drive a Fiero Jamie calls through the door
DAVE MITCH: All right , angel ! Have a nice day !
MITCH: Yup ! Just two dudes chilling in the athroom , nothing weird about that !
DAVE: Listen to me I know I complain about my family sometimes , but Jamie and the kids are everything to me My marriage is falling apart , my job is on the line , and I need you to step up and be the best possible version of me , okay ?
MITCH: Dude , honestly , I 'm working my nuts off over here . I do n't know how to play you any better .

A NECKTIE: Black not white socks Dress shoes , not shower sandals And underwear .
MITCH: Oh come on !
DAVE: No ! No more commando ! You are a grown-ass man !
DAVE: This is called a grocery store . You uy food here . Before heading to the market , always call Jamie first and ask her if she needs anything . In fact , before you make anV decisions in your life , no matte how small , call your wife first . Think of yourself as a retarded mule lost in the desert helpless , dumb , and in constant need of direction . Never take initiative , never strike out on your own , neve deviate from the plan you are always wrong . You are a retarded mule lost in the desert .
MITCH: Umm ? A rabbi , a priest ? BAM ! Dave punches Mitch in the nuts .
DAVE: Trick question ! No one fucking cares ! You 're Dave Lockwood , boring dad , you 're not Jerry Fucking Seinfeld ! Shut the fuck up ! Mitch clutches his balls , hurt and scared
TO MITCH: Kid 's a natural born criminal . If he sees 18 , it 'll be from the inside a jail cell .
DAVE: This is called an office , or work . Think about whatever you most want to do here , and then do the exact opposite . You want to go home early ? Great stay all night . Hungry ? Cool do n't eat . Think you oss is a total douche ? Terrific invite him to join your fantasy aseball league .
MITCH: Wait , so I ca n't sleep with my wife and I ca n't sleep with other women ? What is that ?
DAVE: It 's called marriage .
MITCH: Yeah when 's your free time ?
DAVE: Have you been listening to one word I 've said ? ! There is no fucking free time ! You do n't have a life anymore ! You do n't have a personality , or an identity , or a point of view ! You are a dad !
MITCH: Dry handjob ?
DAVE: Nothing ! You 're not single anymore ! No one gives you a cupcake every time you hold the door or speak in complete sentences , it 's expected of you now , so grow up !
MITCH: Okay , can I just say something without you punching my cock ? I think you might be taking some of this adult shit a little seriously

MITCH: I 'm sorry , I just got you a date with the number one girl on you Cancer List and this is the thanks I get ?
DAVE: I 'm not going on the date , Mitch .
MITCH: Yes you are .
DAVE: No . I 'm not .
MITCH: Yes you are , because if you do n't , I will feed'your children non- organic snacks and then introduce them to my extensive girl-on-horse pornography collection . How do you think Jamie will react to that ? Dave just looks at Mitch , horrified .
DAVE: WhyWhy are you doing this to me ?

JAMIE: Honey ? .
JAMIE: Well , looks like you wo n't be doing allet at the rec center anymore .
CARA: That 's okay . I did n't really like it anyway .
MITCH: Where 'd you learn to ninja-flip a girl like that ?
CARA: The internet .
MITCH: Good girl . So what 'd we learn from this ?
CARA: Always solve my problems with violence .
MITCH: That 's right , baby . Bones . They bump fists . Jamie is stunned .
JAMIE: What ? ! No , angel , that 's exactly the wrong lesson . You should neve use violence , except to defend yourself , okay ?
MITCH: Violence is cool .
JAMIE: Dave !
MITCH: I 'm kidding !
TO CARA: I 'm not kidding .
CARA: I love you , Daddy
SURPRISED: Oh . I-I love you too , angel .
MITCH: Do n't move . I 'll be right over .
DAVE: How do I look ? !
MITCH: Like a fucking tool . Step aside
DAVE: Jeans ? To a restaurant ?
MITCH: Shut up and do what I say . We only have 3 hours to make you cool
MITCH: Do n't speak , it jiggles your sack .
DAVE: I ca n't believe you just charged a Ferrari to my Discover Card .
MITCH: You need to learn to be spontaneous , Dave . Chicks like spontaneous . Hey ladies ! Show us your tits !
DAVE: What are we gon na tell Jamie ?
MITCH: Do me a favor , Dave . Relax you utt hole .
DAVE: What ?
MITCH: Your sphincter . Just release it . Dave 's entire body visibly relaxes a bit .
DAVE RECLINES: Good . Now take some deep breaths . Now give me your sunglasses .
DAVE: It 's been so long since I felt cool
MITCH: I know , baby . I know .
DAVE: Why are we washing the car ? It 's and new .
MITCH: We 're not washing the car , David . We 're getting you mentally , physically , and spiritually ready for your date . Come on .
DAVE: You mean like J-date ?
MITCH: Fuck J-date . No . The internet has changed chicks in three major ways first , access and acceptance of pornography has commoditized women and pressured them into becoming sluttier at far younger ages , which is awesome .
DAVE: What 's a Lady Gaga ?
MITCH: I do n't know , it 's either a pop singer or an energy drink .
DAVE: So wait , why are we at a car wash ?
MITCH: The girls are alone , bored , and old enough to drive it 's a goldmine . I run game here four to seven times a week . Now go on , bust a move .
DAVE: Come on , I talk to women all the time , I do n't need to practice .
MITCH: Really .
DAVE: Yes . And no offense , as a married man , I probably know how to talk to women better than you do .
MITCH: Reall v !
DAVE: Yes ! It 's not that hard . They just want to be respected and listened to like everybody else .
MITCH: Okay Daddy Day Care show me how it 's done then ! Shit !
DAVE: Hello there what 's your name ? !
MITCH: Shake it off . Being single is like the Tour De France it 's all about quick recovery time . Now go on , get your groove back , you 're meeting Sabrina in a half hour .
DAVE: Your name is Dora ? Like the Explorah ? ! No ? You are n't familiar with that show ?
YOUNG WOMAN: My car 's ready .
MITCH: Forty seconds . Not bad . Your times are improving .
DAVE: I forgot how hard it is to be single
MITCH: As a general rule , when you 're talking to single women , conversation topics to avoid include your wife , your children , your favorite playgrounds , and The Wiggles
DAVE: I do n't feel good about this .
MITCH: Relax you 're dressed cool , you hair is crushing it , your ballsack is taut and smooth , and you 're way etter looking than you 've eve een . Just remember Uncle Mitch 's Golden Rule of Dating .
DAVE: I know , always use an alias .
MITCH: What ? No . No , my Golden Rule of Dating is always find the fun . Think of it like this for the next two hours , you 're stuck with this chick . Does n't matter if she 's cool or crazy or if she was born with a vagina on her forehead you 're stuck , so make the most of it . I dated this chick named Topaz once who may or may not have killed he father . Long story short , she looked like 50 miles of bad road and I was n't interested , but I used our time together to learn about incest and the failures of the American Appellate Court system . I found it hugely informative , and Topaz got caught up in my enthusiasm and gave me a crying lowjob on the car-ride home , so everybody won . The point is find the fun for yourself and great things will follow .
SABRINA: Hey !
DAVE: Hey . Hi . Hello .
SABRINA: What . . .what is that ?
DAVE: I-I do n't know ! I really do n't !
SABRINA: So . How long have you known Dave ?
DAVE: M-My whole life , actually .

DAVE: What , like a total douchebag ?
SABRINA: No . I mean , he totally did , but it 's fine . I have brothers .
DAVE: So . You like working with Dave ?
SABRINA: I love it . He 's the best .
DAVE: Is n't he just ?

MITCH: No ! Course not .
DAVE: Right ! That 's crazy Beat .
MITCH: Is it though ? Mitch bumps fists with smiling co-workers
DAVE: It 's so strange , when the change-up happened , we were so focussed on switching back into our bodies that we did n't even consider that this might be exactly what we both needed
MITCH: Yeah , we 're fucking morons .
DAVE: All right , well , see ya , Dave

SABRINA: Why not ? Just then the door flies open and
JAMIE: Dave is cheating on me !
DAVE: No I 'm not ! I 'm so not !
JAMIE: How could you lie to me , Mitch ? ! We 've known each other for !
COVERING HERSELF: Who is this chick ? !

MITCH: O-Okay ? Well . I 'm leaving because I 'm a fuck up . Do you know what a fuck up is ?
NODDING: Like Uncle Mitch .
MITCH: Right . Right . Well , I thought this time was different , you know ? I thought I actually did something ight for once . But no , I 'm still the same old fuck up I 've always een . Only this time I really fucking fucked up , because I fucked up my life and my best friend 's life
CARA: I do n't think you 're a fuck up .
MITCH: Thanks , sweetie , but your brain is the size of a radish . I am a fuck up . I always have been , and I always will be . Guys like me , we know how to have fun , but we do n't know how to do the important stuff , you know ? Be good , okay , kiddo ?
JAMIE: Mitch ?
JAMIE: What is the matter with you ? !
DAVE: Look , I know I have n't been a very good husband or father recently
JAMIE: What are you talking about ?
DAVE: But I 'm done looking over the fence for something better . I 've seen what 's on the other side , and it 's great . . .and young and supple ut it 's not you . And the truth is there will always be another fence with shinier toys on the othe side , but the only way to be happy is to say fuck the fence and just appreciate what you have , you know ? Find the fun with what you got
JAMIE: O-Okay ?
DAVE: I 'm so sorry I stopped appreciating you , pumpkin . I love you . And I love our weird little kids . And I ca n't believe I ever thought that was n't enough .

MITCH: So , um , are you guys driving me to the desert to kill me ?
DAVE: No . Jamie knows about the change- up . We 're all good .
JAMIE: It suddenly makes a lot more sense why you spent so much time rubbing my breastfeeding cream onto my oobs every night .
DAVE: Really , dude ?
MITCH: I was justtrying to be helpful .

WALTER: He said my dad ran off because he did n't like me .
CHRISTINE: Your dad never even had a chance to meet youso how could he not like you ?
WALTER: Then why did he leave ?
CHRISTINE: Well , the same day you were born , something else arrived . It came in the mail , in a box just slightly igger than you . You know what was in that box ? Something called responsibility . Now , to some people , responsibility is fun , it 's what you live you whole life for . Other people think it 's the scariest thing in the world .
WALTER: So he ran away because he was scared of what was in the box ?
CHRISTINE: Yup .

WALTER: Who 's that ?
CHRISTINE: I do n't know . Nobody does . That 's what makes him so mysterious .
WALTER: Oh . Am I too heavy for you to carry ?
CHRISTINE: Not for years yet , Walter . Not fo years .

COOK: Ten minutes , then I 'm calling the cops .
BOY: I do n't remember .
COOK: Swell .
JONES: Mrs. Collins ?
CHRISTINE: All these reportersyou did n't tell me
JONES: Yours is a story with a happy ending , Mrs. Collins . People love happy endings . Train should be pulling in shortly . We 'd better get a move on .
"WALTER": Did you know that Los Angeles is where they make the Tom Mix movies ?
MATRON: No , I did n't .
"WALTER": His horse is named Blue . You think they 'll let me watch them make a movie ?
MATRON: I do n't know , you 'll have to ask . But with all this attention , who knows , maybe they will .
JONES: Mrs. Collins , I 'd like to introduce you to Chief of Police James E. Davis .
CHRISTINE: Oh , my , I did n't expect
DAVIS: We do n't get a lot of positive attention from the boys in the press these days , so it 's good to be here when there 's a positive story , do n't you think ?
CHRISTINE: Ohyes , of course , they 've been great . Well , there was that part about having to wait twenty-fou hours before filing a report , but
DAVIS: Technicalities aside
CHRISTINE: Yesother than that , no complaints . They 've all been wonderful .
DAVIS: Good , then you wo n't have any problem telling that to the press , and how the LAPD is concerned first and foremost with the safety of
JONES: Women . Just a sec .
CHRISTINE: WalterWalter !
JONES: Well ? Are n't you going to
CHRISTINE: He 's not my son .
JONES: Iwhat are you
CHRISTINE: He 's not my son . He 's not my son .
JONES: I'mI 'm sure you 're mistaken .
CHRISTINE: Mistaken ?
JONES: He 's been through four long , terrible monthshe 's gone through changes , lost weight
CHRISTINE: I know my own son .
JONES: I 'm just sayingI mean , you 're in shock , and he 's changed , and
"WALTER": Walter Collins .
CHRISTINE: It 's a common name , it
JONES: Do you know where you live , Walter ? Do you know your home address ?
"WALTER": My house is at 210 North Avenue 23 , Los Angeles , California . And that 's my Mommy !
JONES: Mrs. Collinslisten to me . I know you 're feeling uncertain right now , but that 's to be expecteda oy this age changes so fastbut we 've compensated for that in ou investigation . We 're experts in child identification . There 's no question that this is your son .
CHRISTINE: It 's not Walter .
JONES: It 's not Walter as you remember him . That 's why it 's important for you to take him home , on atrial basis .
CHRISTINE: A trial basis ?
JONES: Once you 've put him back in familia surroundings , and given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed conditionyou 'll see that it is him . I swear to you , Mrs. Collins . I give you my word . Trust methis is your son .
CHRISTINE: Ilook , I 'll take him home , but only because Imight not be thinking clearly right now , and
JONES: Thank you .
REPORTERS: How does it feel to have your son home , Mrs. Collins ? What did you think when you saw him for the first time ?
CHRISTINE: It wasit'shard to explain .
JONES: It was certainly quite a shock . At first she hardly recognized him . Perfectly natural , the boy 's been through quite an ordeal .
REPORTER: How 're you feeling , son ? Bet it feels great to be home .
"WALTER": Yeah , it 's great !
DAVIS: The Los Angeles Police Department is thankful for all the hard work done by the De Kalb County Sheriff 's Department in helping to make this joyful reunion possible . The LAPD is dedicated to serving the public at all times , and
ANOTHER REPORTER: Can we get a photo of mother and son , Captain ?
JONES: Absolutely .
CHRISTINE: Was the sandwich all right ? Would you like some more milk ?
"WALTER": No .
CHRISTINE: No , thank you .
"WALTER": No , thank you .
CHRISTINE: Now you need a bath . You 're covered with soot from the train ride .
"WALTER": I fell . Stupid tub .
CHRISTINE: Did you hurt yourself ? Let me see
JONES: Mrs. Collins
CHRISTINE: I do n't know who he is , or why he 's saying he 's Walter , but there 's clearly been some kind of mistake .
JONES: We agreed you would give him time to adjust
CHRISTINE: He 's four inches shorter than Walter . Boys his age do n't shrink . If anything , he should be taller .
JONES: Maybe your measurements are off . Look , I 'm sure there 's a reasonable explanation for
CHRISTINE: He 's circumcised . Walter was n't .
JONES: Mrs. Collinsyour son was missing for four months . For at least part of that in the company of an as-yet unidentified drifter . Who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done ? He could have had himcircumcised might have
CHRISTINE: Made him smaller ? Captain , please
JONES: I am listening , damn it , I I am listening . And I understand your feelings . He 's changed , no mistake . You 've both been through a terrible experience . That 's why he needs your support and love to ounce back .
CHRISTINE: Captain , that boy would n't bounce ack as my son if you coated him in ubber and dropped him off the roof .
JONES: Why are you doing this , Mrs. Collins ? You seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy , your work pays you enough to attend to his personal needsso I do n't understand why you 're trying to run away from you esponsibilities
CHRISTINE: I 'm not running away from anything , least of all my responsibilities . I 'm even taking care of that boy ecause right now I 'm all he has . What worries me is that you 've stopped looking for Walter .
JONES: Why should we look someone we 've already found ?
CHRISTINE: But you have n't found him . He 's still out there somewhere , lost , maybe hurt .
JONES: His identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification , people who know what they 're doing .
CHRISTINE: And I do n't ? Captain , look , I do n't want to cause trouble for you o the department . Honestly I do n't . I know you 've done everything you canbut there 's been a terrible mistake , and I need your help if we 're going to correct itbefore it 's too late . Please .
JONES: Sara , get Dr. Tarr on the phone .
DR. TARR: Mrs. Collins ? Dr. Earl W. Tarr . Captain Jones sent me . I consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases . May I come in ?
CHRISTINE: Ohyes , of course .
DR. TARR: Well , I 'm here now , and we 'll put all that to rights . Where is the oy ?
CHRISTINE: Doctor Tarr , I thought you were here to help me .
DR. TARR: I am . Captain Jones said the boy had gone through some extreme physical changes , and asked me to look in on himto reassure you in this your time of motherly concern .
CHRISTINE: My `` motherly concern '' is n't for him ecause he 's not my son .
DR. TARR: Statements like that will hardly help the boy 's self-esteem , now will they ? Captain Jones said something about a change in height ?
CHRISTINE: He 's four inches shorter than
DR. TARR: Ah , wellhardly a mystery , Mrs. Collins . We 've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children . Given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually shrunk . It 's uncommon , ut within the realm of possibility .
CHRISTINE: What about the circumcision ?
DR. TARR: Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate . After all , circumcision is hygienically sound . Must have een quite traumatic at the time . No wonder he 's submerged the memory .
CHRISTINE: Look , doctor
DR. TARR: As you can see , there 's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this . But it 's good for you to aise these questions . You should e apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence .
CHRISTINE: Would n't I know whether or not he was my son ? I 'm his mother .
DR. TARR: Which means you 're in no position to be objective . You are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember . He is n't the same oy that left here , just as a boy who goes off to war and returns is n't the same anymore .
CHRISTINE: What 're you
DR. TARR: Hello , children , my name is Dr. Earl W. Tarr . I 'd like to ask you some questions .
1ST KID: My mom says we 're not supposed to talk to strangers .
DR. TARR: Good boy . Quite right . But as you see I 'm with the police , so it 's all right . Now , I 'm sure you know Mrs. Collins here , and her son , Walter . How many of you recognize this young boy as Walter Collins ?
2ND KID: Walter was as tall as me .
DR. TARR: Yes , precisely . He was as tall as you . Now he 's not . He 's lost a little height , you see . It 's a thing called trauma . With luck , none of you will ever have to find out about it yourselves . So othe than that , do you recognize this as your friend , Walter Collins ?
2ND KID: I guess
CHRISTINE: Dr. Tarr
DR. TARR: Already ahead of you , Mrs. Collins ; children can be intimidated . But not adults . Shall we try a neighbor ?
MRS. RILEY: I 'd be happy to . I saw the boy often . Come closer , son .
DR. TARR: Take your timebe sure .
MRS. RILEY: Oh , yesyesthat 's Walter all ight . Used to come here all the time to play with my nephew , Roger .
DR. TARR: Thank you , Mrs. Riley . You 've been a big help , I
CHRISTINE: Before we goMrs . Riley , do you have the time ?
MRS. RILEY: Certainly .
CHRISTINE: Thank you .
DR. TARR: A boy is much larger than a watch , Mrs. Collins . Come along , son .
CHRISTINE: Captain , Ino , listen to me , this so-called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who could n't even recognize her own He found what he expected to find , what you obviously told him he would find , but it 's not No , I am not reassured .
"WALTER": I 'm finished . Can I go to my room now ?
CHRISTINE: Yes . Go on up .
"WALTER": G'night , Mommy .
CHRISTINE: Stop saying that ! I 'm not you mother ! And you 're not my son !
REV. BRIEGLEB: Lovely bit of phrasing , is n't it ? Noticed since the return of the boy to his mother . Not only does it state clearly that you are the boy 's mother , one could infer from this that you are somehow responsible for these changesand that the police are concerned for the boy 's welfare in your hands . You should try the eggs , they 're very good .
CHRISTINE: `` I examined the boy quite thoroughly , Dr. Tarr said
DR. TARR: and it 's clear that he has something to tell . I 'm sure that in time he will give his boyish story of the entire affair , but not until he has faith in his listener . And that is what is lacking faith in the poor lad 's story . In the course of my examination , I found nothing to dispute the findings by the LAPD .
REPORTER: How come he has n't been able to tell anyone what happened while he was gone ?
DR. TARR: I would say that the boy has eithe een coached or questioned to a point where he is largely confused about what happened to him during
CHRISTINE: Captain Jones promised he 'd let me see the report before it went anywhere else .
REV. BRIEGLEB: Someone in authority at the LAPD lied ? Good heavens , I may have to go lie down .
CHRISTINE: Why are they doing this ?
REV. BRIEGLEB: To avoid admitting a mistakethat they brought back the wrong boy . Anyone reading that with half a ain would see through it instantly . Sadly , that leaves out about half the Times ' readership , but still .
CHRISTINE: Thank you .
REV. BRIEGLEB: You have no idea how many people have sat in that very chair and said those exact same words to me in relation to our friends at the Los Angeles Police Department . Mrs. Collins , I have made it my mission to bring to light all the things the LAPD would prefer no one knew anything abouta department uled by violence , abuse , murder , corruption and intimidation .
DAVIS: We will hold court on gunmen in the Los Angeles streets . I want them ought in dead , not alive , and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least mercy to a criminal .
REV. BRIEGLEB: This police department does not tolerate dissent , contradiction or embarrassment , Mrs. Collins . You have the power to embarrass themand they do n't like it . Not when they became the Heroes of the Hour the day they stood there posing with you , having rescued a lost boy from the wilderness .
CHRISTINE: Reverend BrieglebI appreciate what you 're saying , and what you 're doingbut I 'm not on a mission . The only thing I want is to find my son , that 's all , and I just
REV. BRIEGLEB: A lot of mothers ' sons ended up eing sacrificed to expediency around here , Mrs. Collins . Yours would n't e the first . Do this right , and maybe yours will be the last .
CHRISTINE: If they honestly thought I was wrong , that 'd be one thingbut if they do n't care , if they 're just trying to cover it up .
REV. BRIEGLEB: This is their attempt to win by framing the discussion their way . `` Why , of course it 's her sonyes , there have been changeswe 're looking into it , and is n't it strange that they happened after the boy got home ? '' They 're putting you in the position of having to disprove what they 're sayingand that 's hard . Most people believe what they hear from the police or the government . If you play it their way , youand your sonare going to lose .
CHRISTINE: What do I have to do ?
REV. BRIEGLEB: Change the rules of engagement . Re- define the argument . They brought in their expert , so you bring in yours . You have an advantage they do n't . You know your son bette than they ever will , and in that knowledge is the proof you need . Get that information , put it out there . Make them respond to you , not the other way around .
CHRISTINE: Well ?
DR. MONTGOMERY: He had two cavities that needed filling . He put up a fight , but I took care of it .
CHRISTINE: And ?
DR. MONTGOMERY: Your son 's upper front teeth were separated by a small muscle . Made them sit about an eighth of an inch apart . The boy in that room has no such gap .
CHRISTINE: Does a gap like that get smalle with age ? Because that 's what they 'll say .
DR. MONTGOMERY: In some cases , yes , it 's possible . But the muscle between Walter 's teeth prevents that from happening . They can never come together without an operation to sever the muscle , and I can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation .
CHRISTINE: Will you be willing to sign a lette saying that officially ?
DR. MONTGOMERY: Pardon my language , buthell , yes .
CHRISTINE: Well ? What do you think ? Is that the Walter Collins that you remember ?
MRS. FOX: If it is , he 's changed enormously . Do you know who I am ?
"WALTER": You 're a teacher .
MRS. FOX: Yes , but even teachers have names . What 's mine ?
"WALTER": I do n't remember . I know you , but I do n't remember your name .
MRS. FOX: My name is Mrs. Fox . Now , take your seat .
REV. BRIEGLEB: I 'll see you tonight at eight fo my broadcast . I 'll leave the back door open and a light on . Good luck .
CHRISTINE: Good morning . My name is Christine Collins . On March 10th , my nine year old son , Walter Collins , disappeared . A four month investigation resulted in a boy eing brought to Los Angeles from De Kalb , Illinois . They told me , and all of you , that this boy was my son . They were wrong . The Los Angeles Police Department made a mistakea terrible mistake . The boy they found is not my son . That is the reason for the supposed `` transformation . '' I have letters from his dentist , his teachers and others confirming that this boy is not my son . The letters are being eprinted now , and I should have them for you tomorrow .
JONES: Morelli , I want you to find the Collins woman and get her here . Bring her in the back way , and have a couple of matrons standing by .
1ST COP: Yes , sir .
CHRISTINE: Why are we using the back door ?
1ST COP: Captain 's orders . Front 's jammed with reporters .
CHRISTINE: Is it ?
DESK SERGEANT: Heyanybody want to take a call from the Royal Canadian Mounties ? Ybarra ?
YBARRA: What 'd they do , lose a moose ?
DESK SERGEANT: They need a juvenile living here illegally deported back to Canada . He 's living with his cousin on some anch near Riverside , in Wineville .
YBARRA: All right , I 'll take it , got nothing etter to do .
JONES: Mrs. Collins .
CHRISTINE: It was n't my intention to embarrass anyone .
JONES: No , of course not . You just told the papers we ca n't tell one boy from another as a compliment fo the months we spent working on you case . Are you trying to make fools out of us ? Is that it ? Do you enjoy this ?
CHRISTINE: No , of course not . I had to get your attention , I had to make you understandhe 's not my son .
JONES: You know what your problem is ? You want to shirk your responsibilities as a mother . You enjoyed being a free woman , did n't you ? Enjoyed not having to worry about a young son . You could do what you wanted , go where you wanted , see anyone you wanted . But then we found you son . Brought him back . And now he 's an inconvenience . That 's why you cooked up this whole scheme , to try and throw him to the state , let the state raise him for you .
CHRISTINE: That 's not true !
JONES: No ? Even the boy says he 's you son . Why would he do that ? How would he know to do that ?
CHRISTINE: I do n't know ! All I know is that he 's lying !
JONES: Maybe so . Maybe he is a liar . But that 's how he 's been trained , is n't it ? Lying was born in both of you . You 're a liar and a troublemake and if you ask me you 've got no usiness walking the streets of Los Angeles .
CHRISTINE: Just a minute
JONES: Because either you know you 're lying , or you 're not capable of knowing if you 're lying or telling the truth . So which is it , Mrs. Collins ? Are you a derelict mother ? Or just nuts ? Because from where I sit , those are the only options .
CHRISTINE: I 'm not going to sit here and take this
JONES: You want to bring in experts ? Doctors ? Well , I can do that too . Matron ?
CHRISTINE: Yes .
MATRON: Please do n't struggle , ma'am . You 'll only hurt yourself .
JONES: You are to convey the prisoner to the Los Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward .
CHRISTINE: Nowait , you ca n't
JONES: Make the following entry in the ooking department Defendant states she has been deceived by police and others , and that they have given her a boy and tried to make he think it is her son when she says it is not .
MATRON: Got another code twelve .
NURSE: Name ?
MATRON: Collins . Christine .
CHRISTINE: Waitplease , this is a mistake .
NURSE: Certifying officer ?
MATRON: Captain J. J. Jones , Lincoln Heights division .
CHRISTINE: Pleaseyou have to listen to me . The police are doing this to punish me . They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son , ut it was n't my son , and now they say I 'm crazy
NURSE: If you continue to struggle I 'll have to put you in a straitjacket . Do you want that ? Good . Then behave yourself . Code twelve .
CHRISTINE: No , please , you have to listen to mewaitplease !
NURSE: Take off your clothes .
CHRISTINE: Why ?
NURSE: Physical examination , body cavity search and de-lousing . Required for all new patients .
CHRISTINE: That 's not necessary
NURSE: You can remove your clothes yourself , or I can have the orderlies do it for you . Which do you prefer ?
CHRISTINE: The morning ? Butwait , I 've got to talk to someone in authority
NURSE: Sorry .
PATIENT: My roomno , nothis isthis is MY room .
CHRISTINE: Then if I could just use the phone .
NURSE: Phone privileges are earned by good ehavior . You 're not allowed newspapers , magazines , radio , books or sharp objects . This is for you own good .
CHRISTINE: Waitplease ! There 's been a terrible mistake !
PATIENT: My room . My room . They SAID it was MY ROOM !
CHRISTINE: I 'm sorry , I
YBARRA: Problem ?
GORDON: Overheated , that 's all . She 'll be fine in a bit .
YBARRA: Listen , could you give me a hand ? I 'm trying to find a place called the Northcott Ranch , up by Wineville .
GORDON: Northcott Ranchoh yeah . You 're almost there . Follow this west fo about two , three miles . Then the next right . That 'll bring you right to it . Something going on ?
YBARRA: Just looking into a juvenile matter . Thanks for the help .
SANFORD: What difference does it make now ?
YBARRA: We 're just sending you back to Canada , son , it is n't the end of the world .
SANFORD: What ?
YBARRA: You ca n't just stay in the U.S. as long as you want , pal . We 've got a orders to send you back home , and
BRIEGLEB: No word from Mrs. Collins ? Get on down to her house , make sure she 's all right . If she 's not there , call the LAPD , see what they know .
GORDON: I 'd like a ticket to Canada . Alberta or Vancouver , whatever 's leaving tonight .
TICKET VENDER: Do n't have anything going that fa tonight . Best I can do is put you on a train for Seattle . From there you can transfer to one of the locals or drive across the border .
GORDON: That 'll be fine .
TICKET VENDER: Round-trip ?
GORDON: One way .
TICKET VENDER: That 'll be fifteen dollars .
CHRISTINE: Can I see the doctor ? Or someone in charge
NURSE: Breakfast is half an hour .
CHRISTINE: But I
NURSE: Down the hall . The doctor will call for you when he 's ready . Go or stay , either way I lock the door .
CHRISTINE: Christine . Christine Collins .
ADMINISTRATOR: ClarkSanford Clark .
SANFORD: Wait , II want to talk to the officer who brought me in .
ADMINISTRATOR: I 'm sure he has far more important things to do than
SANFORD: Please . It 's important .
ADMINISTRATOR: He 's off-duty until tomorrow , but I 'll see what I can do . No promises .
DRIVER: How far you going ?
GORDON: Vancouver .
DRIVER: Hop in .
GORDON: Yeah , I surely do .
STEELE: Mrs. CollinsDr . Jonathan Steele . Please , have a seat .
CHRISTINE: Fine . Thank you .
STEELE: Really ? I 'd think it would be quite difficult at first .
CHRISTINE: Well , it was . Difficult , I mean . But comfortable .
STEELE: I see they took a blood test .
CHRISTINE: Wasserman Test . To check fo syphilis . Apparently it can affect the mind .
STEELE: The idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilisdid that upset you ?
CHRISTINE: No . Not at all . I 'm sure it 's standard procedure .
STEELE: Yes . Exactly . Standard procedure . We have to cover all bases , and
CHRISTINE: Butat the same timeI imagine that it would bewould probably e upsetting tosome people that someone else mightsuspect that of them . However inappropriate that might e .
STEELE: According to your file , you believe the police have substituted a fake oy for your son . Is that true ?
CHRISTINE: I did n't say they substituted a fake oy , justnot the right boy . They brought back the wrong boy . Not my son . He 's still missing .
STEELE: That 's strangeyou see , I have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station , welcoming your son home . That is you in the photo , is n't it ?
CHRISTINE: Yes .
STEELE: So at first he was your son , but now he 's not your son . Has this been going on for a long time ? Peoplechanging , becoming something other than what they are ?
CHRISTINE: People do n't change , doctor .
STEELE: You do n't think people change ?
CHRISTINE: That 's not what I
STEELE: And the policethey 're not out to persecute you ?
CHRISTINE: No . Of course not .
STEELE: The police are here to protect us .
CHRISTINE: That 's right .
STEELE: That 's odd , because according to the head nurse , when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately , to punish you . So either she and the interns are also conspiring against youor you 're changing your story . Do you often have trouble telling eality from fantasy , Mrs. Collins ?
ADMINISTRATOR: I 'm sorry to bring you out in this weather , detective , but the boy has een quite insistent .
YBARRA: It 's all right , I 'll just see what he has to say so I can go home and get dry . Where is he ?
ADMINISTRATOR: Room seven .
YBARRA: It 's raining cats , dogs and democrats out there , so this better be worth it .
SANFORD: Look , I this is n't easy , okay ?
YBARRA: Nothing is .
SANFORD: My cousin 's Gordon Northcott . He owns the ranch where you found me . He let me live there in exchange for watching the place when he was gone , doing chores , stuff like that . Said I could stay on as long as I wanted to . I figured that also meant I could leave whenever I wanted to , but he would n't let me .
YBARRA: Are you saying he held you prisoner ? Bull . When I got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird . Could 've left any time you wanted . So what 's this , some kind of story to cover why you were in the country illegally ?
SANFORD: Nono , it 's nothing like that .
YBARRA: Because I do n't have time for
SANFORD: Listen to me , please . He said
YBARRA: What ? What did he
SANFORD: He said that if I tried to leave , he 'd kill me !
YBARRA: Okay , lets start at the beginning . What did he make you do ?
SANFORD: Him and meme and Gordon , we we killed some kids .
YBARRA: What kids ?
SANFORD: I do n't knowI never knew thei names .
YBARRA: How many kids ?
SANFORD: All together ?
YBARRA: You 're lying .
SANFORD: No , it 's true , I swear !
YBARRA: Twenty kids .
SANFORD: YeahthereaboutsI kinda stopped counting after a while , and Gordon said one or two might 've gotten away , but
YBARRA: Nobody can just up and kill twenty kids
SANFORD: We didyeah , we did that .
YBARRA: How ?
SANFORD: Most times we 'd bring back just one or twosometimes as many as three .
GORDON: Time to go .
KID: You have ?
GORDON: Sure thing . Your folks , they got in an accident . They sent us to find you . They 're hurt real bad . The police took 'em to the hospital , ut they did n't have time to come find you , so we said we 'd do it . Now come on , hurrywe got ta get to the hospital , see your folks .
SANFORD: It 's okay . Come on in .
GORDON: Good boy ! Now hold on , it 's a long drive and we got ta fly .
SANFORD: Sometimessometimes he 'd leave one or two of 'em alivebarely anywayand tell mefinish 'em . Finish 'emor I 'll finish you . And I didI didoh godoh , sweet JesusI killed 'emI killed 'emI killed 'em .
YBARRA: Theseuhmthese kidsdo you thinkif you saw them again , do you think you 'd recognize them ? Just a second .
JONES: Have you gone soft in the head , Les ?
YBARRA: Sir , I
JONES: He 's playing you ! He knows he 's in trouble , so he 's come up with some cock and bull story about how he was forced to stay in the country
YBARRA: With all due respect , sir , I do n't think so . You did n't see him , the kid 's scared half out of his mind
JONES: He picked the Collins kid ! We found him , remember ? Have n't you been eading the papers ? Or maybe you have , is that it ?
YBARRA: Sir , if you 'd just listen
SECRETARY: I 'm sorry , captain , but he 's here againthat reverend , Briegleb . He 's asking about Christine Collins .
JONES: Tell the sonofabitch to get the hell off police property before I have him arrested for disturbing the peace .
SECRETARY: I tried . He said he 's not leaving him , or his friends .
JONES: What the hell ?
YBARRA: Sir , department policy requires that all allegations of homicide have to be investigated . And these are kids , for chrissakes
JONES: Departmental policy is what I say it is , you got that ? Now I 'm ordering you to get your ass back here with that kid , you got that ? You bring him here and you talk to no one , got it ? Nobody !
YBARRA: All right , let 's go .
BRIEGLEB: Are you Captain Jones ?
JONES: I am .
BRIEGLEB: What the hell have you done with Christine Collins ? Do n't try and lie your way out of it . I talked to several neighbors who saw he eing driven off in a police car .
JONES: Mrs. Collins has been placed in protective custody following a mental eakdown .
BRIEGLEB: A what ? !
JONES: Her statements and behavior have een found to be consistent with a delusional state of mind that could make her a danger to herself o others . In the public interest , we are looking after her son while she gets the help she clearly needs .
BRIEGLEB: Where ?
JONES: Sorry , we 're withholding that information to respect the privacy of the family . But I can assure you that she 's getting the best treatment available . That 's all .
ORDERLY: Go on . Move up .
CHRISTINE: What for ?
ORDERLY: Medication .
CHRISTINE: What kind of medication ?
ORDERLY: The kind that 's good for you . Help you relax .
CHRISTINE: I do n't want to relaxI 'm fine , and I wo n't take something unless I know what it is !
NURSE: Orderly
CHRISTINE: Just listen
NURSE: we can force-feed it to you if that 's what you want .
CHRISTINE: DoctorDoctor Steele
STEELE: I heard .
CHRISTINE: I do n't know what 's going on , but I 'm not taking anything until
STEELE: I understand . Come with me .
CHRISTINE: I do n't have anything wrong with me that I should have to take medication .
STEELE: There 's nothing wrong with you .
CHRISTINE: That 's right .
STEELE: You 're fine .
CHRISTINE: Yes .
STEELE: Then you should n't have any trouble signing this .
CHRISTINE: I wo n't sign it .
STEELE: Then your condition is not improved . Sign it , and you can be out of here first thing tomorrow .
CHRISTINE: I wo n't sign it !
STEELE: Mrs. Collins , you 're becoming agitated .
CHRISTINE: I will tear down the walls of this place with my bare hands if I have to , but one way or another
STEELE: Orderly !
CHRISTINE: No !
STEELE: Stay out of this ! This is none of your business ! This is police business ! You 'll stay out of it if you know what 's good for you !
CHRISTINE: Carol ! No , leave her alone ! What 're you
YBARRA: It 's all right , I 'll take it from here .
OFFICER: But
YBARRA: We need him for questioning . Come on .
CHRISTINE: You should n't have done that .
OFFICER: All clear .
YBARRA: All right . Show me .
OFFICER: Holy god .
YBARRA: Call it inget the coroner and every officer in a twenty mile radius here inside the hour .

REV. BRIEGLEB: Mrs. CollinsChristine !
CHRISTINE: Nogodno .
REV. BRIEGLEB: I 'm sorryI did n't want you to find out like thisI 'm sorryI 'm sorry .
OFFICER: The chief will see you now .
DAVIS: I do n't know if you 're aware of it , Captain , but I have an exceptionally good vocabulary . I 'm a terror at Scrabble , crossword puzzles , but even I 'm in awe of the vocabulary that the press and the city council have been exercising in reference to this department courtesy of the Christine Collinsincident . Incompetent . Cowardly . Bullying . Reprehensible . Mendacious and invidiousthose two courtesy of that prick Gustav Briegleb . Bonus words in Scrabble , both of them . Especially invidious . Hard to work that one into a conversation . But he managed it , all right .
JONES: Sir , I
DAVIS: The key , of course , is the context in which words like this get used . You have to do that in scrabble , you know , when somebody challenges a wordshow how it 's used in a sentence . So `` incompetent , '' as in `` A department so incompetent that they never realized that up to twenty children were being kidnapped and murdered under their very noses . '' And here `` So incompetent that they insisted they knew better than a mother the identity of her own child , forced him upon her , and then incarcerated her when she confronted them with evidence of their own eprehensible behavior . '' That was a two-fer . Incompetent and eprehensible in the same sentence . Guy must be a real terror at crossword puzzles .
JONES: Sir , nobody could have known what was going on up at that ranch . Not us , not the Sheriff 's Department , the Marshall 's Officeas for the Collins woman . I 'm still not convinced that he kid is among the victims up in Wineville .
DAVIS: No ?
JONES: No , sir .
DAVIS: Maybe he waswhich raises the obvious question so what ?
JONES: Sir ?
DAVIS: The Mayor wants this to go away . I want this to go away . The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned anch . Because if the boy you ought back is n't Walter Collins , and he 's not dead up at that ranch , then where the hell is he ? People will want to know why we have n't found him . Why we are n't we doing our job . But if , on the other hand , he is , or could be among those poor boys killed up in Winevillethen the inquiries stop . It 's a momentary embarrassment that you 'll have to live withbut better a short inconvenience than a lingering problem , would n't you say , Captain ?
JONES: Yes , sir .
DAVIS: The boy 's been gone for nearly a year . If he was going to be found , it would 've happened by now . Whethe he was up at that ranch or not , the truth is he probably is dead somewhere . Better his mother accepts that now rather than later , do n't you think ?
JONES: Yes , sir .
DAVIS: Good . That 'll be all , Captain .
JONES: Sir , there 's talk of an investigation y the police commission .
DAVIS: Let me worry about the commission . But it would n't hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you ought back from De Kalb and why he did this , because the press bought into his bullshit same as we did . That we were all taken in by the scheming little bastard may help take some of the sting off this .
JONES: My boys are working on it now , sir .
"WALTER": I want a glass of water .
YBARRA: Tough .
"WALTER": `` Tough ! ''
YBARRA: What 's your name ?
"WALTER": Walter Collins .
YBARRA: Walter Collins is dead .
"WALTER": I did n't do it .
YBARRA: Look , let me explain something to you . Because of your lies , you 've uined a woman 's life embarrassed the police department , and got the whole city up in arms over this .
"WALTER": Got a lot done , did n't I ?
YBARRA: All right , if that 's how you want it , then I guess we 're done here . Tell County Jail we 're remanding him for trial .
"WALTER": Waitwhat 's remanding ? What trial ?
YBARRA: I told you , the real Walter Collins was murdered .
"WALTER": So ? I did n't do anything ! I was n't even here when it happened !
YBARRA: By pretending to be Walter Collins , you 're interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder . We can try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact . Too bad . County Jail is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home . A lot worse .
"WALTER": You ca n't do thatI 'm just a kid !
YBARRA: Sanford Clark is a kid , too . Fifteen . But he 's going to jail . All murderers and their accomplices go to jail . Everyone knows that . Get him out of here . It 's out of my hands now .
"WALTER": Wait ! I do n't want to go to jail .
YBARRA: Prove it .
JONES: Did you check the wire services ?
YBARRA: Checks out . The report was filed y his divorced mother , who lives in Clinton , Iowa with the boy 's grandmother . Apparently he did n't like living with the old lady , she did n't let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with , and one dayhe up and left .
JONES: What about the man he showed up with at the diner ?
YBARRA: Just some drifter . The boy was hungry , ran into this guy who said he knew how to get some food and not have to pay for it . Only when they finished , he left the kid behind while he cut out . When the police picked him up , they started going through the wire reports about missing kids
JONES: And he overheard them say the name Walter Collins .
YBARRA: Bingo .
JONES: But why that one ? I mean , of all the police departments he could 've screwed up , why Los Angeles ?
YBARRA: I asked him the same question .
"WALTER": II knew that Los Angeles was where they made the Tom Mix movies . I figured maybe I could meet Tom Mix . Maybe he 'd even let me ride his horse . His horse is named Blue . Did you know that ?
BRIEGLEB: How are you feeling ?
CHRISTINE: A little better , thanks . The sleep helped . Anything new outside ?
BRIEGLEB: Nothing that ca n't wait until you 're stronger . The police still have a car parked outside . They want to know what your next move is .
CHRISTINE: I want to go home .
BRIEGLEB: And then ?
CHRISTINE: I 've been giving that a great deal of thought ever since I got out of thatplace . All those women , and what they did about Walter . They 're going to just keep on doing it , are n't they ? Nothing 's going to changeunless we make it change .
BRIEGLEB: It 's dangerous , and you 've already een through a great deal , Mrs. Collins . Right now you 're sufficiently high-profile that the police will hesitate to come afte you out in the openbut if they see their position threatened , that could change quickly . Your life could be in danger .
CHRISTINE: `` Always finish it . Always . ''
RACHEL CLARK: Just a minute .
GORDON: Hi , sis .
RACHEL CLARK: GordonI did n't know you were ack in town .
GORDON: Got in a couple of days ago , figured I 'd surprise you . That okay ?
RACHEL CLARK: Yesyes , of course . Come on in .
GORDON: Where 's that little niece of mine ?
RACHEL CLARK: Shewent into town . Should be ack this evening . Bob 's here
GORDON: Good . Need to talk to him about staying on for a few days .
RACHEL CLARK: Staying
GORDON: Listen , can I use your bathroom ? It 's been a long ride and I could use a shower .
RACHEL CLARK: Of course .
BOB: Is that Go next door . I 'll call the police . Hurry .
MOUNTIE: Go around the other side ! Cut him off !
SECOND MOUNTIE: Go on ! Get the bastard !
MOUNTIE: Screw thisI 'm too old for this fightin ' shit .
BRIEGLEB: Mrs. Collins , I want you to meet a friend of mine , Mr. Hahn .
CHRISTINE: Hello .
HAHN: Mrs. Collins . My deepest condolences on your loss .
REV. BRIEGLEB: Can we come in ?
CHRISTINE: Yesof course .
HAHN: Yes .
CHRISTINE: I appreciate the sentiment , but so far they still have n't positively identified any of theremains as Walter 's .
HAHN: But he was identified , was he not ?
CHRISTINE: Yes , butI guess I still ca n't accept it . It does n't feel real to me .
HAHN: It never does . I lost a daughte to polio five years ago . There 's not a day goes by I do n't think , I should mention this to Claudine then I remember she 's not here .
CHRISTINE: I 'm sorry . Please , sit .
REV. BRIEGLEB: I know . My sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing . They 're going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong , that the real blame is with the kidand with you , for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety .
CHRISTINE: Then we 'll just have to hire a lawyerbring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call fo a hearing by the Welfare Board .
REV. BRIEGLEB: Jut one problem .
CHRISTINE: I see .
HAHN: Which is why I 'm doing this pro ono . It would be my honor to defend you honor , Mrs. Collins . In my fifteen years as a lawyer , I have neve seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have , in what is so clearly in the cause of justice .
REV. BRIEGLEB: Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn here the whole story , from end to end , leave nothing out , he 'll need it all if he 's going to get the City Council involved .
CHRISTINE: Of course . One thing , though . A personal favor . When we 've finished here today , could you spare a few minutes to come with me downtown .
HAHN: Of course . Where downtown ?
NURSE: Yes ? May I
HAHN: My name is S. S .
NURSE: I 'm sorry , but the doctor in charge wo n't be in until tomorrow morning and
HAHN: Let me be clearer . Either you open those doors and produce the people named in that court order , or you will find yourself on the othe side of those barswithout a key .
CHRISTINE: It 's all righteverything 's going to be all right now .
REPORTER: Mr. Northcott , any comment on you arrest ?
GORDON: I 'm feeling fine .
REPORTER: How did you avoid capture ?
GORDON: Well , I did n't , did I ? Did n't know anyone wanted me until just recently . Did n't even try . My luggage still has my initials on it .
ANOTHER REPORTER: Did you know why the police were after you ?
GORDON: No , but I figured it would be best if I stayed out of it .
REPORTER: Anything to say to the parents of the children you murdered ?
GORDON: No comment .
DAVIS: Mayor Cryerthis is unexpected .
CRYER: So was this .
DAVIS: Goddamnit .
CRYER: I thought this was supposed to go away . This is an election year , I ca n't afford this kind of press .
DAVIS: It is going away , sir . I instructed Captain Jones
CRYER: I 'm afraid falling on his sword and saying he made a mistake is n't going to be good enough , Chief . If we take him out of the picture for a while , it might help calm things down until the hearing 's finished . There are several people on the council who are planning to run against me , and they 'd love to accuse me of allowing a renegade police force to operate with impunity .
DAVIS: Mayor CryerI stand by my men . You know that .
CRYER: I do . And you know where I stand . So the question is..are we going to stand togetheror hang together ?
MAYOR CRYER: Gentlemengentlemen , please . As Mayor of Los Angeles , it is my duty to preserve the peace in our city , which has been disrupted by recent events in the case of Christine Collins . As a result , we have decided that Captain J. J. Jones of the Lincoln Heights Division is to e suspended from active duty , effective immediately .
REPORTER: What 's the charge , Chief ?
CHIEF DAVIS: The charge is conduct unbecoming an officer , and using improper and abusive language toward Mrs. Collins . It further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police office y incarcerating Mrs. Collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause .
REPORTER: Mayor Cryer , are you aware that the City Council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the Collins case ?
MAYOR CRYER: I 've heard this , yes . But since one of the main purposes of such a hearing by the City Council would e to suspend Captain Jones , and since that action has now been taken , the question is moot .
REPORTER: Which makes it look like the only eason Jones is being suspended is to head off the City Council
CHIEF DAVIS: I wo n't even dignify that question with a response . Good day .
CRYER: Cheer up , Chief . That little show should take the wind out of thei sails . By Monday , this issue will e as cold as yesterday 's fish . Never underestimate the public 's lack of attention and potential fo apathy . Old news is dead news , you 'll see .
CHRISTINE: Reverend , what
BRIEGLEB: Sorry to barge in so late , Mrs. Collins , but it took me a while to find the right people for the right job . These three gentlemen are members of my congregation who , efore coming to the Lord , had lived lives of brutality , vice and crime . Now they are pledged to doing god 's workand if this is n't it , I do n't know what is .
CHRISTINE: I do n't understand .
BRIEGLEB: People who bring charges against the police have a habit of
CHRISTINE: I seewell , Ithank you . Can I get you anything ?
BRIEGLEB: Since we do n't plan on sleeping , coffee would be lovely .
REV. BRIEGLEB: Almost there . Just a few more locks .
CHRISTINE: Where is all this traffic 's coming from ?
MAN: Did n't you hear ? It 's the biggest protest I 've ever seen .
REV. BRIEGLEB: Protest ?
OFFICER: Yeahover that Collins broad , if you can believe that .
CHRISTINE: He did n't meanhe could n't mean
REV. BRIEGLEB: I do n't knowall I know is that I think I just stopped breathing .
CHRISTINE: Ohmy .
REV. BRIEGLEB: The Lord works in mysterious ways , Mrs. Collins .
THORPE: There are nearly one thousand people gathered in this chamber , more than have ever been in this room before .
SECOND COUNCILMAN: Mr. Thorpe , I do n't see any othe members of the Police Commission .
THORPE: That 's oddwe specifically stipulated that we would begin ou hearings with testimony from the police department . Are there any epresentatives of the Police Commission in the room ? Is Chief Davis here ? Is Captain Jones here ? Is there anyone here representing the police ?
REPORTER: Mr. ChairmanRichard Thomas , The Evening Herald . Both the Police Chief and Captain Jones are in San Pedro for a police inspection at a station there .
THORPE: Are you telling me they directly violated the wishes of the City Council ? That they refused to attend a vital hearing so they could conduct a routine inspection in San Pedro ? And what the hell is Jones doing at an inspection after being suspended ? I hate to call a recess before we 've even started , but I think a few phone calls are in order . So we 'll take a half hour break , then continue with the witnesses who have appeared here today . But let it be known that Captain Jones and Police Chief Davis will be subpoenaed and required to appear here tomorrow morning .
HAHN: Mrs. Collins , could you come across the street with me for just a moment ?
CHRISTINE: Butshould n't we
HAHN: I think there 's something you should see .
MRS. CLAY: Mrs. Collins ? I 'm Leanne Clay , this is my husband , JohnI just wanted to pass on my sympathies . What we went through , waiting to hear anything about our son David , was bad enough , and now this . But there was no call for what the police did to youno call at all .
BAILIFF: All rise .
GORDON: HeyI saw you in the papers . You got a lot of moxie , standing up to the police like that .
JUDGE: Gordon Stewart Northcott , you have een charged with three counts of murder in the first degree , with an additional seventeen counts unde eview by the district attorney 's office . How do you plea ?
GORDON: Not guilty , your honor .
JUDGE: In light of the defendant 's penchant for international travel , no bail will be set . This court will receive preliminary motions by tomorrow morning , with a trial date to be set for the earliest opening on the court 's calendar . The defendant is remanded into custody . Bailiff .
JONES: We then instituted a nationwide search . On July 10 , we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his description had been found in De Kalb , Illinois . Upon questioning , he admitted to being Walter Collins , and we made arrangements to transport him back to California .
HAHN: Where Mrs. Collins told you the boy was not her son .
JONES: Yes . She denied his identity in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary .
HAHN: But as subsequent events have demonstrated , she was correct . So what prompted you to send her fo psychological evaluation ?
JONES: Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision . Throughout this period , she acted strangely . She was often cool , aloof and unemotional , especially when presented with the oy we located in De Kalb , and in our subsequent conversations . It was because of her disturbing ehavior that I submitted her fo observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Hospital .
HAHN: Just like that . You snap you fingers and an innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward .
JONES: She was n't
HAHN: Every home in this state is in grave danger when a Police Captain can take a woman into his office and , five minutes later , have her thrown into the psychopathic ward on his own authority !
JONES: She was n't
HAHN: What was that , Captain ?
JONES: She was n't thrown . She was escorted .
HAHN: Escorted , thrown , the verb does n't matter , Captain . What does matte is that her incarceration was ordered without a warrant .
JONES: I did .
HAHN: And what is the date on this document ?
JONES: September 12th .
HAHN: But Mrs. Collins was incarcerated on September 6th .
JONES: The form is backdated .
HAHN: Yes , so it would appear . The bottom of the page is reserved for recording where and when the warrant was served . But it has not been filled in . May I assume from this that the warrant was never served ?
JONES: That 's correct . There was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody .
HAHN: Let me see if I have this straight . A woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant , ecause no warrant existed , and when it was finally written six days later , there was no need to sign it or go to a judge because
JONES: Technicallyyes .
HAHN: Because she questioned you .
JONES: Because she would n't listen , because she insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands est left to qualified officers , ecause
HAHN: Because she was fighting for the life of her son ! A boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong !
JONES: Yes . It is .
HAHN: No further questions .
CHIEF DAVIS: so after much effort , we were able to identify this boy , who was has been responsible for so much ecent trouble , as Arthur Hutchins of Cedar Rapids , Iowa . Between this , and the arrest of the man suspected of murdering the real Walter Collins , we have cleared up two of the biggest mysteries in the history of Los Angeles . I hope that you gentlemen of the press will give as much space to the good things we do as the mistakes that are made on rare occasions .
MOTHER: I hope he has n't been too much trouble for you .
CHIEF DAVIS: Oh , no , not at all .
WRIGHT: Mrs. HutchinsMrs . Collins , the woman he was staying with , wanted him to have these . They 're the clothes she let him wear .
MOTHER: Well , thank you . Is n't that nice , Arthur ? Tell the nice officer thank you .
"WALTER": I do n't want 'em ! Give 'em to somebody else !
DAVIS: Precocious little fellow , is n't he ?
"WALTER": It 's not my fault ! It was the police ! They said I was Walte Collins , not me ! It was n't my idea !
CHIEF DAVIS: Thereblame the police for you own mistakes . We 've seen a lot of that lately , have n't we ?
CHRISTINE: I 'm up here , Reverend .
REV. BRIEGLEB: Mothers and their children are connected in amazing ways . My uncle joined the army during the big war , and the day he died , before we eve heard a word about it , my grandmothe woke up in the middle of the night and said , `` Bobby 's gone . '' She justknew .
CHRISTINE: That 's why I do n't think Walter is dead . I can still feel him , in this room .
REV. BRIEGLEB: Mrs. Collins
CHRISTINE: I know what the police said . But the remainswhat they found on that ranch is somost of it ca n't even be properly identified . What if that boy made a mistake when he picked Walter 's picture ?
REV. BRIEGLEB: I understand that you do n't want to accept this . What mother does ? But you have to let goand start over . For yourself . He 'd want you to move on .
CHRISTINE: Maybe . And maybe he 'd want me to keep looking . Maybe he 's waiting for me , somewhere .
REV. BRIEGLEB: He is , Christine .
THORPE: This Committee has now heard all of the testimony , and in light of the facts presented , issues the following statement .
JUDGE: Mr. Foreman , has the jury reached a verdict ?
FOREMAN: We have , your honor .
THORPE: While the City Council has no powe to directly remove commissioners o
JUDGE: Bailiff , will you bring me the verdict of the jury ?
THORPE: Second , we recommend that the suspension of Captain Jones be made permanent .
JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise ?
THORPE: Third , that steps be taken to investigate a change in the prevailing laws and procedures by
JUDGE: You may read the verdict .
FOREMAN: We the jury find the defendant , Gordon Stewart Northcottguilty on all counts of murder in the first degree .
JUDGE: Does the defendant wish to make a statement before judgment is passed ?
GORDON: Yeah , I want to make a statement . I want to make it real clear that I never once got a fair shake from you , your `` honor , '' or this court . The only one of you here worth a goddamn is her 'cause she 's the only one neve admouthed me to the press . She understands what it is when the police frame you for something you did n't do and throw you in the hole . Is n't that right ?
JUDGE: That 's enough ! Counsel , you will get control of your client or I will have him bound and gagged .
CHIEF DAVIS: no , as I said after the hearing , I have every intention of finishing my term as Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department . I will not esign . I will fight to the finish . The Collins case was merely an excuse for certain politicians who have een trying to have me removed fo some time , and I
CHRISTINE: Ten minute break ?
MR. HARRIS: Of course .
CHRISTINE: We 'll see . Thanks , Ben .
HAHN: Mrs. Collins .
CHRISTINE: Oh , hello , I was just
HAHN: I know . That'swhy I wanted to see you .
CHRISTINE: From who ?
HAHN: Gordon Northcott . He'she 's asked to see you .
CHRISTINE: Why ?
HAHN: He said he knows you 're still looking for your son , and before he dies He says that he lied when he testified that he did n't kill Walter . He 's willing to finally admit that he did it . He says that if you come up to see him , in personhe 'll tell you the truth , to your faceso that you can get on with your life and have some peace .
PRISON GUARD: I can stay in the room if you want , ma'am .
CHRISTINE: No , I'msure I 'll be fine .
PRISON GUARD: All rightI 'll be right outside the door if you need anything . Twenty minutes .
GORDON: Do n't suppose you 've got a cigarette ?
CHRISTINE: No , I do n't smoke .
GORDON: That 's where they do it , you know . That building right over there .
CHRISTINE: That 's where they do what ?
GORDON: The hangings . Ten o'clock tonight , I get to see what 's inside . I hea there 's thirteen steps going up to the gallows'cause thirteen is unlucky . Helps make sure you 're gon na go to hell when you die . But I got 'em beat . I outsmarted 'em .
CHRISTINE: Mr. Northcottyou asked me to come to see you . You said if I did , you would tell me the truth about my son . Well , I 'm here .
GORDON: Yeahyeah , you are . But see , the thing is , I did n't think you 'd really come , and now
CHRISTINE: Now what ?
GORDON: I did n't expect . I do n't want to see you .
CHRISTINE: What ?
GORDON: I ca n't do thisI ca n't talk to younot today , not tonight , not with what they 're going to do to me . It 's one thing to send a telegram , that 's easy , but right now , right here , in person , I I ca n't tell you what you want to hear , Mrs. Collins . I ca n't , I ca n't
CHRISTINE: Why not ?
GORDON: Because I do n't want to die with a lie on my lips !
CHRISTINE: Mr. Northcottlook at me . Look at me .
GORDON: Get away from meI do n't know anything about it !
CHRISTINE: Mr. Northcott
GORDON: I 'm innocent ! Guard ! Guard !
CHRISTINE: No , wait , please
PRISON GUARD: It 's okay , ma'am , they always get a little nuts the day of .
CHRISTINE: Did you kill him ? Did you kill my son ?
WARDEN: Gordon Stewart Northcott , you have een found guilty of murder , the penalty for which is death by hanging . There have been no stays or reprieves , therefore the execution will go forward as stipulated unde the laws of the State of California . Do you have any last words ?
GORDON: Nonothing . I kept clean after I confessed , everendjust like I said I would .
OPERATOR: Hey , Chriswe 're having an Osca party tonight at my apartment , you want to come ?
CHRISTINE: I can'tI 've got a million forms to fill out
OPERATOR: C'mon , please , they can wait
CHRISTINE: Sandy , you guys blew out the phone lines between here and Baltimore , someone has to clean up the mess , and that 's me . Besides , I 've got a adio right here , I can follow the whole thing .
OPERATOR: You 're sure ?
CHRISTINE: Positive . Go on , have fun .
MR. HARRIS: Are you sure ?
CHRISTINE: Ben , that 's very sweet , and I wish I couldbut I really need to stay and finish this .
MR. HARRIS: You 've got a deal , Christine . Good night .
CHRISTINE: 'Night .
MR. HARRIS: How about I call you if you win ?
CHRISTINE: I 'll be here .
CHRISTINE: Yes , this is she . Mrs. Clay ? No , of course I remember you , how are you ? Is everything
MRS. CLAY: I wanted to go to him right off , ut they said it was important to talk to him alone first .
CHRISTINE: Are they sure it 's
MRS. CLAY: They 're sure , but more important , I 'm sure . It 's my boy , all rightit 's David . He 's alive , Christine . They found him up in Hysperia .
CHRISTINE: But how
YBARRA: All right , so after you got into the car , what happened next ?
DAVID: They drove me around for a long time , then we ended up at this ranch
GORDON: SHUT UP ! I 'll see you boys later .
YBARRA: Walter .
DAVID: Yeah .
YBARRA: Do you remember his last name ?
DAVID: Collins .
YBARRA: So if you only remember some of the names of the rest , how come you emember his full name ?
DAVID: Because of what happened .
WALTER: We got ta try it !
JEFFREY: We have to get out of here !
WALTER: I 'm not . I 'm not afraid of anything . Do n't you want to go home ? Do n't you want to see your mom again ?
JEFFREY: Anybody else ?
DAVID: Help !
YBARRA: So you do n't know if either of the other two were captured ?
DAVID: No . All I know is , if he had n't come back for meI do n't think I ever would 've gotten out of there .
YBARRA: What happened after that ?
DAVID: I hid in the woods for two days , too scared to move , because I was sure they 'd find me . I finally started walking , but every time a car came up I was afraid it was them . So I kept off the main roads until I saw a train stopped at a crossing , and I jumped in .
YBARRA: Why did n't you tell anyone what had happened ?
DAVID: I was afraid ! I thought they 'd come after me , or my folksso I did n't tell anybody . I was on my own until I got a free meal from this lady , Mrs. Lansing . I told her I was an orphan , on my own . She said I could stay on , andI did . Every night , I 'd wake up , thinking they were right outside my window . Then I heard the police talking on the radio about what happened at the ranch , and I thought , for sure I ca n't go back now .
YBARRA: Why not ?
DAVID: Since I did n't tell anybody what happened , I was afraid they 'd blame me for those kids being dead . So I juststayed away .
YBARRA: So what made you come forward now , after all this time ?
DAVID: I miss my momI miss my dadI justI just want to go home .
YBARRA: Still ca n't believe it . Five years , case closed , everyone thinks he 's deadand there he is .
CHRISTINE: I am .
YBARRA: You do n't think he 's still out there , do you ?
CHRISTINE: Why not ? Three boys made a run fo it that night , Detective . If one got out , maybe either or both of the others did too . Maybe Walte went through the same fears he did . Afraid to come home or identify himself , afraid he 'd get into trouble , that people might think it was his fault . Either way , it gives me something I did n't have before tonight .
YBARRA: What 's that ?
CHRISTINE: Hope .
KAREN CROSS: Police on scene are approaching the suspect . They 're at the center of the Bridge now .
JENKINS: In a civilized society , the men and women entrusted with serving and protecting the community are to be held accountable just like everyone else . Simply put Just because you are a cop , does n't mean laws do n't apply to you . This is no longer the wild , wild west .
KAREN CROSS: This same review board last week found Quentin Conners , Det . York 's partner , `` not responsible '' for the same shooting . He remains on suspension without pay .
LOREN: Drop to the floor ! Slowly ! No sudden moves ! You ! Hands on heads , drop to you knees . Now ! Do it !
LORENZ: That you do n't want to do .
LORENZ: No one will say I did n't give you a choice .
BANK MANAGER: Yes .
LORENZ: Your security system , you can electronically lock all entrances
BANK MANAGER: Yes . Right-right away .
LORENZ: With that attitude , you and I are going to get along famously . Now go . The Bank Manager nods nervously .
BANK MANAGER: It 's done . We 're locked down .
JENKINS: Have you seen my watch ?
LORENZ: What do you think you 're doing ?
TEDDY: This is Detective Galloway .
CALLO: I want all points of entry identified and covered . We need SWAT here now . Have emergency crews standing by !
DAX: We have them on the line . Dax presses a series of buttons .
CALLO: This is Detective Callo , Seattle P.D . Who am I speaking with ?
LORENZ: No questions . It 's time to set the ules . I am in complete control of this facility . No one gets in or out without my say and I will execute every last man , woman and child in here if my needs are not met . Do not test me . Today , I am a man of zero patience .
CALLO: I 'm listening .
LORENZ: See if you ca n't screw this up , Detective I have but one demand . One and only demand .
CONNERS: Do you have a warrant ?
JENKINS: I need to speak to you , Quentin .
CONNERS: There 's where your shit out of luck ecause I do n't need to speak to you .
JENKINS: It 's important .
CONNERS: Huh ? You do n't look like much of a Detective .
DEKKER: Funny . I was going to say the same about you .
CONNERS: Charming .
CONNERS: Save your breath . I really do n't care .
JENKINS: We 've got a hostage situation , American National Bank . The sonsabitches said they would n't talk to anyone but you .
CONNERS: No shit ?
JENKINS: No shit . I need you to do this .
CONNERS: Why should I ?
DEKKER: Because people 's lives are at stake . That takes priority over your ego .
CONNERS: You may want to put a leash on him . Saying I did want to help I 'm still suspended or did that slip your mind ?
JENKINS: The commissioner 's office has ordered me to reinstate you . As of now , you 're ack on the force .
CONNERS: Just like that ?
JENKINS: Just like that . I wo n't , however , unleash you alone .
CONNERS: Always a catch .
JENKINS: Shane , here , is your new partner . Consider him a younger version of me , looking over your shoulder , watching every move you make .
CONNERS: You mean ex-partner .
JENKINS: On the unemployment line with him .
CONNERS: For a moment there , I thought you cared .
JENKINS: I care about those innocent people down there . I hope to God someone has n't made a monumental mistake letting you ack in .
CONNERS: I appreciate the words of encouragement and the confidence you have in me . I look forward to the continuing , positive relationship we 've shared in the past .
KAREN CROSS: Detective Conners ? Detective , can we have a few words ?
CONNERS: I 'll give you two Blow me . If you need a follow-up comment let me know ? Cunt made her career off me .
JENKINS: Conners has been reinstated to full active duty . It 's his scene .
CALLO: The last hostage situation this guy headed , an innocent civilian died .
CONNERS: I was not responsible
CALLO: You never are . That girl would be alive today if it were n't for you cowboy antics . You destroy lives .
CONNERS: Fuck you . Look who 's talking about destroying lives .
JENKINS: Decision 's been made , Bernie .
CALLO: I was first on scene and I have seniority . Do n't do this , Martin .
JENKINS: We 'll talk about it later . Take a hike .
CALLO: Fine . I 'll watch this train wreck from home . Callo exits .
CONNERS: I 'm going to miss him .
JENKINS: SWAT , because of the special circumstances will defer to Conners . He 's in charge .
VINCENT: First time I 've heard SWAT defer to anyone .
JENKINS: Second chances do n't come around often . Do n't blow it .
DEKKER: Yes , Captain .
TEDDY: Looks like you got yourself a baby- sitter .
VINCENT: We have approximately four to seven , heavily armed men holding an unspecified number of customers and employees hostage .
CONNERS: You 're just a wealth of knowledge , are n't you ?
TEDDY: Witnesses heard shots fired and some kind of explosion . And their only demand has been to speak with you .
CONNERS: I 'm sure it wo n't be the last . Get me a line into the bank . Let 's see what they really want .
LORENZ: Detective Conners ?
CONNERS: Who am I speaking with ?
LORENZ: For now You can call me Lorenz . Dekker writes , `` Lorenz . ''
CONNERS: Okay , Lorenz , how are we doing in there ? Can we get you anything ? Food , medical supplies . We heard an explosion .
LORENZ: Everyone who matters is fine . Of course , I would 've preferred not having the authorities involved at all . We were n't planning to be here this long . But , since Seattle 's finest needs a presence on the scene , I 'm glad it 's you .
CONNERS: My fame proceeds me .
LORENZ: Do n't be flattered . I needed someone who 's been through the experience efore . Hopefully this time it will go etter for all involved . I plan on living a full , long and rich life . I did n't , however , expect them to find you so quickly . I thought you were suspended . Dekker writes , `` In The Know , '' on his pad .
CONNERS: I was , but I 'm back . You 're information 's old .
LORENZ: You never get what you pay for . You want to know about the hostages ? How many and are they okay ? Dekker scribbles , `` Pro '' .
CONNERS: Yes .
LORENZ: Approximately forty , they 're fine , considering . All except one . We had a situation .
CONNERS: Someone 's dead ?
LORENZ: Theory put to practice is n't always perfect . Ca n't expect to keep the hostages in check if a bad deed goes unpunished or they may randomly decide to revolt . Chaos has some order to it . Detective ? Are you still with me ?
CONNERS: What else will I be looking for ?
LORENZ: Demands Probably too much to ask for you and your colleagues to pack up and go home ?
CONNERS: Safe to say .
LORENZ: Stay by the phone . I 'll contact you shortly .
CONNERS: Lorenz
LORENZ: Do n't worry , I have no plans until sunrise tomorrow , so hunker down . It 's going to be a long one .
CONNERS: Wait , we 're talking here
LORENZ: Patience , Detective . We do n't want another Pearl Street Bridge , do we ?
DAX: He 's off .
KAREN CROSS: This standoff is approaching two hours now . We 've been told Detectives have made contact with the perpetrators inside the bank . Whether any specific demands have been made , we can not confirm . As soon as we know something , we 'll pass it on to you . Reporting live , Karen Cross , channel two news .
CONNERS: Try again .
DAX: He 's not picking up .
CONNERS: Try again . Dax , humbled , does as ordered .
DEKKER: Went uptown to brief the Commissioner .
CONNERS: So you 're here in his place .
TEDDY: You quit smoking ?
CONNERS: Caffeine , too , if you must know . What ? A man 's capable of change .
TEDDY: A man , yes . You I 'm not so sure .
CONNERS: Do n't worry , I still have a vice or two .
DAX: Fifteen rings . No answer .
CONNERS: Try again in five .
TEDDY: What are they doing in there ?
VINCENT: Wasting our time .
CONNERS: Precisely . He knows police protocol , not to mention the shit in our own precinct . He 's disguising his voice , means he 's got a record and has done this before . He 's heavily armed and well-connected . He knows he 's surrounded . He has n't asked for a damned thing . He drops that hint about sunrise , prepping us for a long wait . He 's buying time . Why ?
VINCENT: To figure out his next move . He was n't expecting us .
DEKKER: No , he was n't expecting you . He said , he thought you were still suspended .
CONNERS: Probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me . Giving him the time he needs .
TEDDY: He 's stalling .
DEKKER: He almost has what he came for .
CONNERS: Or he 's got what he came for and he 's waiting for his ticket out of here . We 're going in .
TEDDY: What ?
CONNERS: The bank has three points of entry . Teddy and Vincent , take a SWAT Team , head to the West side . We 'll have the SWAT Commander take the East . Dekker , you 're with me . Where is the SWAT Commander ?
VINCENT: I 'll find him . Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy .
TEDDY: That 's a big call , Quentin . Thought about what you 're doing ?
CONNERS: You questioning me , Teddy ?
TEDDY: Unfortunately yeah .
CONNERS: I question how you can fuck that asshole and still manage to look in the mirror .
TEDDY: I 'm not going to get into this now . And you 're one to talk . I hear
CONNERS: The hostages are in imminent danger . They 've confessed to killing someone , an automatic murder one charge - that 's a life sentence , maybe a needle for all of them . So why keep witnesses around to testify ? Longer we wait , the greater the isk . We need to go in . Now .
TEDDY: Okay .
SWAT COMMANDER: I got snipers up top and ten soldiers on the ground .
CONNERS: What 's the best way in ?
SWAT COMMANDER: Tear gas , blow the doors
CONNERS: Hold on . No explosives . I got forty
SWAT COMMANDER: There 's no pussy way in . The doors are locked electronically from the inside . We ai n't getting in without force .
CONNERS: What if we cut the power ? That will disable the system and we can open the locks manually , come in that way ?
SWAT COMMANDER: That 'll work .
CONNERS: So we 'll take the pussy way , Commander . We cut the power and go in at 11 15 sharp !
TEDDY: The bank 's equipped with emergency generators , which once the power 's down , will kick back on in approximately 3-6 minutes .
CONNERS: It will be over before that . Commander , your men in position ?
SWAT COMMANDER: Standing by .
CONNERS: I will call for the power to be cut . Once down , wait for my signal and enter . No one moves until I give the `` go '' , understood ? They all nod . They 're ready .
LORENZ: They 're comin ' .
CONNERS: Let 's go around the horn .
TEDDY: One , check .
SWAT COMMANDER: Two , check .
SNIPER #1: Three , check .
SNIPER #2: Four , check .
CONNERS: Here we go Cut the power .
LORENZ: Now !
CONNERS: Hold it . What just happened ?
DEKKER: Holy shit ? !
SWAT COMMANDER: We 're going in !
CONNERS: No . Do not go in . It 's a trap !
SWAT COMMANDER: On my count One two three The SWAT TEAM bum rushes the bank , just as
DEKKER: Round up all the hostages , anyone that comes out , grab'em ! Conners glares at Dekker .
CONNERS: The rest of you , come with us .
VINCENT: No . No one went by me .
SWAT COMMANDER: Detectives We found these . Conners takes one of the masks in his hands .
CONNERS: We let them walk right past us .
VINCENT: We got the one Teller dead , the two that were strung up are alive , but in critical condition . A few SWAT incurred 2nd degree burns , but that 's the worst of it . Now , depending on who you talk to there was anywhere from five to nine perps . And nobody got a good look at any of'em , wore thei masks the whole time . Dax is rounding up the security tapes now . That should give us a firm number .
CONNERS: I want background checks on every hostage . They 're all suspects until they 're not .
VINCENT: You do n't think one of them 's still here ?
CONNERS: After this , nothing would surprise me .
DEKKER: Excuse me I need to listen to the conversation between Lorenz and Conners again ?
DAX: It 'll have to wait .
DEKKER: How long ?
DAX: Hour . Maybe more .
DEKKER: Show me how to play it myself ?
DAX: Look , this is n't how it works . I do n't take orders from you . I do n't know you and NO ONE touches my stuff . You 're going to have to wait .
DEKKER: Along with whatever they stole and this war zone they left behind A man 's dead , and the killers are running free . I do n't have time to wait . I 'll figure it out . Thanks for you help .
DAX: Here . This DAT machine . Play , stop , ewind It 's just like using a tape player . Headphones are jacked in . Tape 's already inside .
DEKKER: Thank you .
CONNERS: What 's with this one ?
DAX: That 's the camera in the vault . It lew in the first explosion .
CONNERS: So we ca n't ID them .
DAX: There 's a four minute , fifty-two second gap , before the image returns . But
CONNERS: They 're long gone by then . Go to the head of the tapes , from when they first went in . Document each move they 've made for the two hours they were inside .
DAX: You got it . Hey Awful lotta news cameras outside . Maybe one got a look at them coming out ?
CONNERS: Have Vincent check it out . Teddy enters
TEDDY: Conners , you better come out here .
CONNERS: Shit . Feds . Jenkins turns to Conners , gestures him over .
JENKINS: Detective Conners , join us , would you ?
AGENT DOYLE: Prince Amar Alle Alban is one of the wealthiest and least popular Arabs in the Middle East . There 's been countless threats on his life and fortune in the past . But for better of worse he is an ally to the United States . The Prince keeps a safe deposit box in twenty institutions
TEDDY: What was in the box ?
BANK MANAGER: We do n't keep records . The boxes are private . Since 9/11 , we screen fo live tissue , viruses or explosives , but if it passes those tests , we do n't ask .
CONNERS: This is all real fascinating shit , but what about the money ? Bank robbers still like cash , do n't they ?
BANK MANAGER: The cash drawers do n't appear touched . Neither does the cash vault .
TEDDY: So they broke into a bank and did n't steal any money ? Odd glances all about .
AGENT DOYLE: We believe the Prince 's box was the target . We 're trying to reach him now .
JENKINS: Thank you . Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave .
CONNERS: Depends , are we talking about your sex life ? Because I 've heard shortcomings .
JENKINS: You got played , Quentin . Congratulations , you just topped Pearl Street Bridge .
TEDDY: That 's not fair . It was by the book . Everything was according to standard procedure . Jenkins ignores Teddy .
CONNERS: You came to me . I did n't ask for this .
JENKINS: Commissioner 's office is scrambling to cover their ass . They need a scapegoat And I have zero problems serving you up .
CONNERS: You wanted this to happen .
JENKINS: No . But if it had to happen to somebody . Jenkins exits .
DEKKER: I think this Lorenz was trying to tell us something .
CONNERS: You do n't say .
DEKKER: The way he spoke he paused before certain words . Have you ever heard of the Chaos Theory ?
CONNERS: What ?
DEKKER: Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory in the 1960 's . It 's the study of phenomena that appear random , but in fact have an element of regularity which can be described mathematically .
CONNERS: Try that again ?
DEKKER: Pretty much initial state of events may seem unrelated and random , but eventually patterns emerge and in the end all the pieces fit together .
WAITRESS: Anything else , officers ?
CONNERS: That 'll be all . You 're a College boy . Which one ? Someplace I 've heard of or one of those inbred state schools no one 's heard of ?
DEKKER: U Dub .
CONNERS: Not exactly Princeton , but not bad . How did you end up on the force ?
DEKKER: It 's kind of the family business .
CONNERS: Family business ? What , your Dad , Dad 's Dad and so on and so back ?
DEKKER: Do we really need all this `` get to know you '' crap ? Couple hours ago you did n't give a shit .
CONNERS: You 've grown on me . Besides , I am entrusting my life to you . I should know something about you . I would
DEKKER: I know about you , Detective . Everyone does .
CONNERS: You do n't say that with much enthusiasm .
DEKKER: Not much to be enthusiastic about .
CONNERS: Listen , my reputation often proceeds me . You , however , have no reputation ; a fact I need to deal with . After you 've been through the shit I have , then you can judge me . Now we can try to work together , make the best of a bad situation or we can compare Dick sizes all day Up to you . But since this is your first day here today mine 's bigger .
KAREN CROSS: Detective Ca n't keep away from me , can you ?
VINCENT: Watch .
CONNERS: Well , that explains you .
VINCENT: Rewind it a little bit . Okay . There . Stop .
DEKKER: What 's he doing back on the street ?
VINCENT: He gave up his partners and cut a deal with the D.A .
TEDDY: Got ta love the system .
CONNERS: Got an address ?
VINCENT: Only thing on file is in Spokane , but I ecall he did have a girlfriend in town . Gina , I believe .
CONNERS: Step back . Clear the door . Now . Just as Vincent does
TEDDY: QUENTIN !
DEKKER: You hit ?
CONNERS: I 'm fine .
THE BIKER: It 's all yours .
RICHARDS: I want my lawyer . His last words before PASSING OUT .
TEDDY: He 's unconscious , with a nice knot on his forehead , but stable . Three officers are watching the room .
CONNERS: He wakes , they call . Hey Quincy , give it a rest , I 'm fine .
PARAMEDIC: Quincy was a coroner . You may have a cracked rib . You should go to the hospital .
CONNERS: I should do a lot of things .
TEDDY: You sure you 're all right ?
CONNERS: I 'm fine .
DEKKER: Girl 's name is Gina Lopez , twenty- eight . Done some time for possession , has two kids Am I interrupting ?
CONNERS: No .
TEDDY: Excuse me . Teddy exits .
DEKKER: Gina claims she does n't know anything about a bank robbery .
CONNERS: Of course she does n't . Vincent ! Vincent trudges out of the kitchen .
VINCENT: Will do . Detective I did n't realize when we first met who you were . I worked with your father . It was only for a brief time when I first got outta the academy , but it was an honor .
CONNERS: Your father was Harry Dekker ?
VINCENT: I wish it could 've been for longer .
DEKKER: Thanks .
CONNERS: That was some fancy riding . You have a ike ?
DEKKER: Used to , but I sold it . They 're dangerous .
MARNIE: Detectives . Ready for you .
CONNERS: Somebody going on a trip ?
MARNIE: Looks like it , do n't it ?
CONNERS: Marnie , you 're looking well .
MARNIE: Heard you were back , Conners and keep dreaming .
CONNERS: Can we get back to work ?
MARNIE: We got passports , sun tan lotion , Bermuda shorts , thong bikini , hopefully hers and this
DEKKER: Must be a fifty large there easy . His cut ?
MARNIE: You 'd think , right ?
DEKKER: It 's not ?
MARNIE: Do n't put words in my mouth , but Two things jump out here . First , each ank branch has their own money bands . This is not American National 's . Afte a little checking , it belongs to Pacific Savings of Seattle .
DEKKER: That sounds familiar .
MARNIE: It should . Four months ago , a half million dollars was stolen in an armed obbery there . Just a smash-n-gra job . They caught the guys a day later , ecovering about $ 400,000 . Those guys have been in lock up since and thei trial 's still pending . Which leads us to point number two . Do you smell that ?
DEKKER: What is it ?
MARNIE: When evidence is taken in , any physical contact might affect the ability to lift prints , so , to mark it , we now spray a scented solution directly on the bill .
CONNERS: Is that new ?
MARNIE: Wave of the future . Got ta keep up with the times , Conners .
DEKKER: So this money 's not from our bank .
MARNIE: No . This is the money from the Pacific Savings job and our evidence room . Now For a list of things you can put in my mouth .
CONNERS: Do you remember who headed up the Pacific Savings case ?
TEDDY: I think it was Callo . Why ?
CONNERS: No reason . Just thinking out loud .
DEKKER: Do n't worry about it .
CONNERS: Your father was a hero .
DEKKER: Yes he was .
CONNERS: At first I thought maybe you were elated to the Captain .
DEKKER: No . No relation .
CONNERS: The Captain , he just kind of `` discovered '' you . Through the academy , to excellent evaluation reports , while
DEKKER: Something like that .
CONNERS: That 's how he found me . This surprises Dekker .
GINA: That money was Dwayne 's
CONNERS: That money came from our evidence room .
GINA: I told you . I do n't know nothing about a bank robbery . Whatever Damon was into , I did n't know !
CONNERS: So , where were you going ?
GINA: Vacation .
CONNERS: This is n't possession or solicitation , Gina . This is felony-murder one . You could get life .
GINA: Me ! ? I did n't do nothing !
CONNERS: It 's `` I did n't do anything . '' `` Did n't do nothing '' is a double negative , infers the positive . The grammar in this country sucks .
GINA: Then I did n't do ANY-thing !
CONNERS: This is n't going away . You want to walk out of here , you tell me something now .
GINA: I swear I do n't know . Now I 'm done talking . I want a lawyer . Dekker lowers his head . Disappointed .
CONNERS: You sure that 's what you want ?
GINA: Yeah .
CONNERS: Fine . Then it 's two phone calls I 'll make . The first will be to the public defender 's office . The second to children 's services .
GINA: What ?
CONNERS: It 's simple if you insist on a lawyer , I take your kids .
GINA: No .
CONNERS: Not like you cared about them anyway . You were ready to fly the coop with `` Shit-for-brains . ''
GINA: No . You ca n't do that .
CONNERS: I can and I will .
GINA: Do n't .
CONNERS: Tell me what I want to know ! Dekker stares incredulously at Conners .
GINA: I do n't know anything . Please do n't take my kids . Please .
CONNERS: Get her some coffee Something hot .
DEKKER: You believe her ?
CONNERS: I think for the first time in that girl 's life she 's telling the truth .
DEKKER: You had to know , once she asked for a lawyer anything she told us would have een inadmissable .
CONNERS: Who would 've known ? It would 've been my word against hers . Who do you think the jury would 've believed ?
DEKKER: Justice by any means . Even if you cross the line .
CONNERS: The only line around here is the ` blue line ' , you cross that one , then you got
TEDDY: Those serial numbers Marnie faxed me According to our computers , that money should be downstairs .
CONNERS: Buzz us in .
HARRY: You got ta sign first .
CONNERS: Have another donut , Frankie .
DEKKER: You 'd have to have some majo firepower , not to mention an extra large set of balls to try and knock off a police station .
CONNERS: Not if you were a cop . You could just walk right in and
HARRY: Here is it . Line seventeen .
DEKKER: Bernie Callo .
HARRY: Like I said No one takes anything out of here , unless they sign for it .
CONNERS: So what He showed you a warrant ? What ?
HARRY: He must 've .
CONNERS: You do n't remember ?
HARRY: You know how many times someone signs shit in and out ? I see the same guys all the time . I ca n't remember one instance two weeks ago . But if his signature 's there , that means he signed for it . Take it up with him !
CONNERS: The money from Richards 's place traced ack to the Pacific Savings heist a few months ago , a case Callo headed up .
TEDDY: Callo signed the money out of evidence two weeks ago .
JENKINS: How much ?
TEDDY: $ 433,000 .
VINCENT: If it 's Callo , it would explain how they knew police protocol and how ou department operates .
TEDDY: Also explains why he was so pissed this morning about being replaced by Conners . He wanted to be the point so everything went according to plan .
CONNERS: He does n't need another reason to be pissed at me .
JENKINS: What about motive ? Do we have one ?
VINCENT: Pressure might 've been getting to him . He 's been getting the cold shoulde from cops since he testified about Pearl Street Bridge .
JENKINS: No . Do n't buy that .
TEDDY: He was also getting divorced . This is news to everyone .
JENKINS: Bernie Callo is a first rate cop . A oy scout . This does n't make any sense .
CONNERS: They never do , Captain .
JENKINS: Do n't act like you 're not enjoying this , Conners . I know what you think of him .
CONNERS: Does n't matter what I think . Facts here speak for themselves .
DEKKER: No they do n't . We have n't asked the question Why , if Callo 's involved , do n't they ask for him at the bank ? They asked for you .
JENKINS: Jenkins .
VINCENT: Blueprints from the bank , schematics , pictures Also , about a dozen internet articles on the Saudi Prince . Found it behind the furnace . Conners nods .
DEKKER: Well , that 's it , right ?
LORENZ: Are you connecting the dots ? Are you putting it together ? Is the pattern emerging ? They would n't punish you , ut I will . Conners GRABS the phone
CONNERS: Then come and get me you piece of shit .
DEKKER: You 'd think a cop would be smarter .
CONNERS: As cops we come across every temptation in the book . Money , drugs , power . We 'd all like to think we can resist any urge , but We 're not saints .
DEKKER: So , Callo was involved and now they 're dragging you into it . Why ?
CONNERS: Man said he wanted vengeance .
DEKKER: Piss anyone off lately ?
CONNERS: Me ?
JENKINS: I just got off the phone with Agent Doyle . After the Charlotte break in , the Prince withdrew all his possessions from every safe deposit box in this country .
DEKKER: Let me get this straight , they did n't touch the cash or the safe deposit oxes . So , they break into a bank , low it up , and steal nothing ? Still make sense to you ?
CONNERS: Nothing about today makes sense .
DEKKER: `` Return to the earth now if your mind is troubled and your heart is uncertain . For it is by returning to the beginning that we can clearly see the path . '' Conners and Jenkins share a confused look .
CONNERS: Do n't look at me , he 's your find .
JENKINS: Say that again , Detective ?
DEKKER: We go back to where this all started . We go to the bank .
DAX: The tapes confirm five bad guys , but since the vault cam blew in the explosion what they did in there was a mystery .
CONNERS: Shutup .
DEKKER: Wait , hold on a second . Did you see it ?
DAX: See what ?
DEKKER: Go back a little .
CONNERS: What ?
DEKKER: Notice the camera angles , they 're all fixed . They do n't rotate or pan . Dax rewinds , to before the explosion
DAX: Where 'd he go ?
CONNERS: He moved it . Changed the angle . He did n't want us to see something .
DEKKER: What 's in that corner they did n't want us to see ?
CONNERS: If I worried about every threat made against me , I 'd never leave the house .
FORENSICS TECHNICIAN: I 'm on my way .
CONNERS: Dax , can you hack in there and find out what they were doing on this machine ?
DAX: Hack into a nationwide bank 's central computer system ? Love to .
DEKKER: What do we do in the meantime ?
CONNERS: You like Italian ?
ITALIAN HOST: Detective , where you been ? Much too long . Sit , sit . I give you best table in house . It 'll just be the two ?
CONNERS: No , four . More are coming .
ITALIAN HOST: Wonderful , wonderful . Who 's this young man ?
CONNERS: For all intents and purposes he 's Big Brother .
ITALIAN HOST: He 's your brother ?
CONNERS: No .
ITALIAN HOST: No matter , no matter I bring you ottle of house wine !
DEKKER: We 're still on duty . No wine .
ITALIAN HOST: No wine ?
CONNERS: A little wine .
ITALIAN HOST: That 's better . They get to the table , Conners looks at it .
CONNERS: Last time I was here , you said that table in the corner was the `` best in the house . ''
ITALIAN HOST: It was . Anywhere you sit becomes best table in house . Now relax , I bring you food .
CONNERS: Shane , what was that thing you said ack at the house about `` returning to the beginning path '' or something ?
DEKKER: It 's a Buddhist story .
CONNERS: We 're all ears .
DEKKER: One day the Buddha found his heart in turmoil . So he retreats to the forest , to the earth , to the base of a great tree and , I 'm paraphrasing , but this elephant comes up and tells Buddha he does n't like seeing him discouraged .
TEDDY: He can talk to an elephant ?
DEKKER: He 's the Buddha . He 's attained the 6th level of consciousness . He 's capable of communicating with plants , trees even rocks .
VINCENT: Rocks ?
DEKKER: You asked .
CONNERS: Continue .
DEKKER: The Buddha was troubled so he went back to where he came from , the beginning , to find the path , the answer . So when you hit a dead end , go back to the eginning to find your way . O something like that .
CONNERS: We have a genuine philosopher in ou midst .
VINCENT: You 're a Buddhist ?
DEKKER: No . Just something I picked up along the way .
TEDDY: But you 're religious ?
DEKKER: Not particularly .
TEDDY: We 've been through a lot together .
DEKKER: I guess I just thought I do n't know . With all the trouble he 's been in lately , coming back from suspension , everyone would treat him differently .
VINCENT: You ca n't believe what you read or see on TV . If anything , our tie to Conners is stronger . He 's one of the best . Even when things got pretty wild today and everyone else panicked , he was in control . That does n't just happen . He 's just that good .
TEDDY: Excuse me .
VINCENT: What was the Buddha looking for ?
DEKKER: The divine in himself . Art 's confused . Dekker 's cellphone rings .
VINCENT: Hours , maybe days . We could be waiting a while .
DEKKER: Dekker./ Okay . They got a match .
CONNERS: What are you doing ?
TEDDY: I realized something today . Being around you , all that 's happened I ca n't I think I made a mistake .
CONNERS: It 's too late . You 've made you choice . Live with it .
DEKKER: We got a match . Teddy separates from Conners .
CONNERS: You got a name ?
DEKKER: Chris Lei .
CONNERS: Sonofabitch .
DEKKER: This was your case . You and York . You made the bust . Why did n't it stick ?
CONNERS: His lawyer put us on trial . Said we were crooked , abusive , that we planted evidence We were in the midst of the Pearl Street Bridge fallout . Jury ought it . They let him walk and we were the scapegoats .
DEKKER: Was it true ?
CONNERS: The guy was guilty . He was scum . That was the truth . There 's something they do n't teach you . The system breaks down . You have to compensate to get results .
DEKKER: That gives you the right to break the ules ?
CONNERS: Break , no . Bend if it means justice Absolutely .
DEKKER: Another thing they do n't teach you .
CHRIS: Shit .
LORENZ: Fare thee well , Chris .
CONNERS: You okay ?
DEKKER: Yeah .
CONNERS: First day in the city and you 've already been shot .
DEKKER: Why do n't I `` just graze '' you with a ullet and see how you feel .
CONNERS: Take five , guys .
DEKKER: May I ?
RICHARDS: You do n't have the balls .
DEKKER: This equipment malfunctions all the time . Overdoses are quite common . Besides , I do n't think the DA 's going to launch a full-scale investigation over a scum like you .
CONNERS: You fuckin ' hypocrite . You give me shit for my interrogating skills least I do n't threaten them with a lethal overdose .
DEKKER: There 's never been a single case in ecorded medical history of someone overdosing on 200 milliliters of saline . Conners checks the label , smiles .
JENKINS: He 's also the brother of John Curtis , the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street Bridge . Richards testifies that he was hired by Curtis to pull the bank job with a dirty cop on the inside , Bernie Callo . Curtis hoped that Conners would take the fall for American National turning ugly , disgracing him even further . We also have the names of two more accomplices , Lamar Galt and Xande Harrington . Everyone was set to meet tonight at ten and we have that address . After finding Callo and Lei dead today ,
CONNERS: You never think of the repercussions . The suspect 's mother , father Brother . How your decision affects them . He had murder in his eyes .
DEKKER: John Curtis .
CONNERS: It was pouring . Lights everywhere . If he had only done what I said .
DEKKER: My father died when I was twelve . He walked into a liquor store in the middle of a stick up . Guy just opened fire . Never even had time to react . They said he was a hero . Know what
CONNERS: So why become a cop ?
DEKKER: Finish what he started . Every day he went out , trying to do some good . Help the people who could n't help themselves , just give'em a chance is what he always said . Did n't always work out right , but he tried . You tried to help save that girl on the idge . If you were n't there , the girl still would 've died . She had a chance ecause you were there . That 's all we can do .
BRANCH: It 's twenty-five after . How much longer we wait ?
CONNERS: We go now all we get is Galt and Harrington . We want Curtis . Now relax and keep the line free .
CONNERS: Shit .
DEKKER: What ?
CONNERS: I 'm out of gum .
DEKKER: Shit .
TEDDY: Conners , we got a problem .
CONNERS: We hold . No one move .
BRANCH: We ca n't let him walk . We have to go now .
CONNERS: No . Stand down .
VINCENT: We 're going to lose'em , Conners .
CONNERS: No . No go . We wait .
VINCENT: We bust them now , we got something . But if they get in that car we do n't have jack squat .
CONNERS: We have three cars here and uniformed ackup in all directions , if they ride , we 'll get them . I want Curtis . We do n't go in that house until I say !
DEKKER: All units , all units . Shots fired ! Requesting backup immediately ! They all rush inside
TEDDY: Drop the gun !
CONNERS: Teddy ! ? What 's happening ? Vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs .
VINCENT: We got one down . He 's dead .
CONNERS: GUN !
TEDDY: Gas . Get out of here ! Get out of here NOW !
DEKKER: Conners !
TEDDY: Everyone get down !
DEKKER: Where 's Conners ? Dekker and Teddy look to the house , when
TEDDY: No ! No , we have to go save him !
DEKKER: We ca n't .
TEDDY: We have to .
DEKKER: Teddy
TEDDY: No !
JENKINS: If it had to be someone Teddy and Dekker overhear this .
TEDDY: You sonofabitch .
JENKINS: Teddy
TEDDY: You 've always been jealous of him .
JENKINS: Jealous ?
TEDDY: It 's because he was n't only a bette cop He was a better man .
JENKINS: Detective . Go home .
DEKKER: No , Captain . She said it perfectly .
KAREN CROSS: Detective Galloway , could you give us a comment ?
DEKKER: Shame on you .
KAREN CROSS: This is more than just news for us . American National 's CFO sits on the Board of Channel Two . They have a vested interest in what 's going on .
DEKKER: Find another source .
TEDDY: Conners was right . We should 've neve gone in . How many more mistakes can we make in one day ? He was eliminating his accomplices . We thought he was going to show up ? We did n't even think he could do this How dumb are we ?
DAX: Detective ?
DEKKER: Meaning ?
DAX: We 've just witnessed the largest heist in history . Somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars .
DEKKER: Come again ?
DAX: It 's a computer virus . `` The Compute Virus . '' It randomly withdraws money from all the accounts and deposits it into the bad guys ' account . If you check the transactions , no two withdrawal amounts are the same and none of'em are over $ 100 . Most security systems work on the size of the money , not number of transactions . Wire out one million from a handful of accounts and red flags go up . Wire out a less than a hundred from ten million accounts , no flags .
DEKKER: Where 's the money now ?
DAX: I tried following one of the transactions . It took me an hour and when I finally had it It went away .
DEKKER: How is that possible ?
DAX: The virus created a host of phantom accounts where the money goes
DEKKER: It 's still moving the money around ?
DAX: Yeah . Any deposit or withdrawal from any bank does n't usually go into affect until the next business day . So it 's going to keep jumping around until it clears at 9 AM tomorrow .
DEKKER: Or 6 AM Pacific time . Sunrise . So why eak in ? If they 're just wiring money ? Could n't they do that from anywhere ?
DAX: That 's the regional manager 's compute terminal . There 's no outside/remote access to it . There you have unlimited entry to the bank 's mainframe . No passwords to work around , no `` hacking '' in . It 's all nice and clean .
DEKKER: A billion dollars is missing and we 're only discovering this now ?
DAX: Ironically , when the power went out , it helped hide the virus and bought it time to work .
DEKKER: So they were n't trying to make it look like they were robbing a bank , to rip off a Saudi Prince ? They were making it look like they ripped off a Saudi Prince to rob a bank . The Chaos Theory .
JENKINS: You 're still here ?
DEKKER: Callo 's insignificant .
JENKINS: What ?
DEKKER: That 's what he said , Callo 's insignificant . But he was n't .
JENKINS: What are you talking about ?
DEKKER: Lorenz Curtis Called me .
JENKINS: He called you ?
DEKKER: He said he did n't kill anyone who did n't deserve it . He said Callo was insignificant . But without Callo he would n't have had the knowledge of ou department and He would n't have had the front money to hire the crew .
JENKINS: He was screwing with your head . Go home , Shane . You did good today . You Dad would be proud . Get some sleep . There will be more bad guys tomorrow . Jenkins exits .
HARRY: I was in bed already . This could n't wait til morning .
DEKKER: How did he come at you , Harry ? It 's the only thing that does n't make sense .
HARRY: What are you talking about ?
DEKKER: All day long we thought Callo was the dirty cop . All day long we were wrong . Dekker slides some papers in front of Harry .
HARRY: Maybe he had a cramp in his hand . I do n't know .
DEKKER: This is your file You were eprimanded , a month ago after you confronted Callo at the courthouse . You punched him . That ring a bell ?
HARRY: And I 'd do it again . Cops who testify against cops should n't be breathing the same air I do . There 's a line you do n't cross !
DEKKER: So you set him up ! You forged Callo 's signature , you gave him the money and you helped him with his plan because you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl Street Bridge ! Do n't deny it , Harry cause I know .
DEKKER: You 're helping a cop killer , Harry . You 're a year from pension . This is how you want to go out ?
HARRY: My conscience is clean .
DEKKER: This has been a very long , trying day . And I 'm tired . We 're chasing a
HARRY: Of course he has . Who knows Conners etter than him ?
DEKKER: How the hell does Curtis know Conners etter than anyone ?
CONNERS: Drop the weapon . Let the girl go .
YORK: That , you do n't want to do . York narrows his aim on John Curtis .
JOHN CURTIS: One step closer and the girl dies .
CONNERS: Think about this you kill her , where are you going to
DEKKER: It was York who was the bad cop . He assumed Scott Curtis 's identity to throw us off the trail .
HARRY: Do what you want to me . He called to tell me he was going and he 's gone and you ai n't never going to find him .
DEKKER: Watch me .
DAX: The number York used to call Harry Hume is a cellphone number . Ran it through
DEKKER: Can they get a location on him ?
DAX: That particular phone he 's using is equipped with the latest GPS technology . Should be able to trace his location within 100 meters or less . Yeah ? They got him .
DEKKER: No . If there 's a signal . Means he 's still here . He 's waiting for something or someone .
DAX: Waiting ? Where ? Ai n't nothing down there that 's open at this hour .
DEKKER: 175th street There 's is one place .
TEDDY: I 'm going with you .
DEKKER: Detective Galloway
TEDDY: It 's not a request .
PRETTY WAITRESS: That 'll be $ 8.48 , please .
YORK: Keep the change .
PRETTY WAITRESS: Thanks , mister .
DEKKER: Jason York this is the police . Put your hands in the air and slowly get on your knees . Do it . Now !
YORK: Do n't shoot . You win .
DEKKER: Get down on the pavement !
YORK: I 'm cooperating . You win . York takes another tiny back-step .
DEKKER: Take the back !
YORK: Was it Harry ? It was Harry , right ? That fat fuck !
DEKKER: Let the girl go . It 's over .
YORK: Easy for you to say . I 'm a plane ride away from a King 's Ransom .
DEKKER: Drop the weapon , let the girl go .
YORK: And spend the rest of my days in a cage ? Let me ponder Do n't think so . If you 're going to stop me I 'm gon na make you earn it .
DEKKER: That you do n't want to do .
YORK: That 's exactly what I said to him . Do you see the irony here ? Am I the only one ? Two months ago I was in you shoes . Some punk holding a gun to an innocent girl . What should you do ?
DEKKER: Shit .
TEDDY: I 'm fine . Go get him .
DEKKER: Which way did he go ?
PRETTY WAITRESS: That way . Down towards the pier .
DEKKER: FBI 's got a team of 40 compute technicians figuring out Lei 's virus . They 'll break it . Dekker rounds a corner
YORK: Your conviction would be admirable , if it was n't just so sad . At the far end of the container , York FIRES ! Dekker ducks back . York takes a look out , does n't see Dekker .
TEDDY: We used to spend all day Sunday just eading in bed . I would read the pape and he would read one of his billion ooks . I did n't deserve him . I knew that . But I still loved him . Teddy stares out the window POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross .
DEKKER: They said in the city I 'd be busy . Every day like this ?
TEDDY: Pretty much .
DEKKER: Great . I wonder what 's next ?
TEDDY: For me a long vacation .
DEKKER: How much ?
PRETTY WAITRESS: Do you think I 'm going to charge you after all that ? Go on .
DEKKER: Thanks .
MARNIE: Do you smell that ?
DEKKER: What is it ?
MARNIE: When evidence is taken in , any physical mark might effect the ability to lift prints , so , to mark it , we spray it with a scented solution . Off of Conners ' LOOK .
WAITRESS: Anything else , officers ?
DEKKER: You tried them all ? / Nothing fo Conners or Lorenz ? / I do n't know . No , maybe he 's not on a flight .
CONNERS: I did n't kill anyone who did n't deserve it .
DEKKER: All day long , we were trying to find out who the inside source was it was you .
CONNERS: The more information you gather , from as many sources as possible , no matte how unpleasant the methods are , the etter . And while I 'd like to take sole credit it was a team effort .
DEKKER: Teddy 's pretty devastated about you death .
TEDDY: Gas . Get out of here ! Get out of here
DEKKER: So the corpse in the morgue with you name on its toe ?
CONNERS: Callo deserved his fate . It 's his fault .
DEKKER: This is Callo 's fault ?
CONNERS: If it were n't for him , York and I would 've never done this . One random act , causes another , causes another , and in the end the pattern emerges . That 's the Chaos Theory . It 's after six . The money 's cleared . I 'm a wealthy man . Lei , for all his
DEKKER: Lei you tanked his trial on purpose .
CONNERS: They should 've suspended me after I testified . What did they expect ?
DEKKER: And because the `` bitch that made he career off you '' worked for Channel Two , that 's why American National was the target .
CONNERS: Everybody who screwed us , got screwed . Everything in its right place .
DEKKER: Why not kill me ? You had plenty of opportunities .
CONNERS: This was n't about killing , Shane . This was about standing up for what matters . Besides you kinda grew on me .
DEKKER: You 're not going to get away .
DEKKER: Conners ? Conners ?
STEWARDESS: Good morning , Sir . I 'll let the Captain know we 're ready . She hands him a glass of champagne .
CONNERS: No thank you . I 'm fine .
REGGIE: Do n't tell me you did n't know it was loaded . Sylvie !
REGGIE: Is n't there something constructive he can do like start an avalanche ?
SYLVIE: Va jouer , mon ange .
REGGIE: Sylvie I 'm getting a divorce .
SYLVIE: Ça alors ! From Charles ?
REGGIE: He 's the only husband I 've got . I tried to make it work , I really have ut
SYLVIE: But what ?
REGGIE: I do n't know how to explain it . I 'm just too miserable .
SYLVIE: It is infuriating that you unhappiness does not turn to fat !
REGGIE: Because I do n't love him .
SYLVIE: But that is no reason to get a divorce !
REGGIE: I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial ,
MAN: Does this belong to you ?
PETER: Oh , forgive me . Is this yours ?
REGGIE: It 's hers . Where 'd you find him , obbing a bank ?
PETER: He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild . We do n't know each other , do we ?
REGGIE: Why , do you think we 're going to ?
PETER: I do n't know how would I know ?
REGGIE: I 'm afraid I already know a great many people . Until one of them dies I could n't possibly meet anyone else .
PETER: Yes , of course . But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list
REGGIE: Quitter .
PETER: How 's that ?
REGGIE: You give up awfully easy , do n't you ?
SYLVIE: Viens , Jean-Louis , let us take a walk . I have never seen a Rothschild efore .
PETER: Clever fellow almost missed me .
REGGIE: I 'm afraid you 're blocking my view .
PETER: Sorry . Which view would you like ?
REGGIE: The one you 're blocking . This is the last chance I have I 'm flying ack to Paris this afternoon . What 's your name ?
PETER: Peter Joshua .
REGGIE: I 'm Regina Lampert .
PETER: Is there a Mr. Lampert ?
REGGIE: Yes .
PETER: Good for you .
REGGIE: No , it is n't . I 'm getting a divorce .
PETER: Please , not on my account .
REGGIE: No , you see , I do n't really love him .
PETER: Well , you 're honest , anyway .
REGGIE: Yes , I am I 'm compulsive about it dishonesty infuriates me . Like when you go into a drugstore .
PETER: I 'm not sure I
REGGIE: Well , you go in and you ask for some toothpaste the small size and the man brings you the large size . You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size . I always thought the large size was the largest size , but he says that the family size , the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size that the large size is the smallest size there is .
PETER: Oh . I guess .
REGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Joshua ?
PETER: Yes , but we 're divorced .
REGGIE: That was n't a proposal I was just curious .
PETER: Is your husband with you ?
REGGIE: Oh , Charles is hardly ever with me . First it was separate rooms now we 're trying it with cities . What do people call you Pete ?
PETER: Mr. Joshua . Well , I 've enjoyed talking with you .
REGGIE: Now you 're angry .
PETER: No , I 'm not I 've got some packing to do . I 'm also going back to Paris today .
REGGIE: Oh . Well , was n't it Shakespeare who said `` When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again '' ?
PETER: Shakespeare never said that .
REGGIE: How do you know ?
PETER: It 's terrible you just made it up .
REGGIE: Well , the idea 's right , anyway . Are you going to call me ?
PETER: Are you in the book ?
REGGIE: Charles is .
PETER: Is there only one Charles Lampert ?
REGGIE: Lord , I hope so .
SYLVIE: He knows everything .
REGGIE: Do n't you want me to stay ?
REGGIE: Merci .
REGGIE'S VOICE: Wonderful .
REGGIE: Honorine ! No answer .
GRANDPIERRE: Madame Charles Lampert ?
REGGIE: Yes .
GRANDPIERRE: I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire . Would you e so kind as to come with me , please ?
GRANDPIERRE: You loved him ?
REGGIE: I 'm very cold .
GRANDPIERRE: We discovered your husband 's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line . He was dressed only in his pajamas . Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France ?
REGGIE: Leave ?
GRANDPIERRE: Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape . ' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven .
REGGIE: I 'm very confused .
GRANDPIERRE: He was American ?
REGGIE: Swiss .
GRANDPIERRE: Oh . Swiss . His profession ?
REGGIE: He did n't have one .
GRANDPIERRE: He was a wealthy man ?
REGGIE: I do n't know . I suppose so .
GRANDPIERRE: About how wealthy would you say ?
REGGIE: I do n't know .
GRANDPIERRE: Where did he keep his money ?
REGGIE: I do n't know .
GRANDPIERRE: Besides yourself , who is his nearest elation ?
REGGIE: I do n't know .
GRANDPIERRE: C'est absurde , Madame . To-tale-ment absurde !
REGGIE: I know . I 'm sorry .
GRANDPIERRE: It is all right .
REGGIE: I wish you would n't .
GRANDPIERRE: Les effets de Lampert . The POLICEMAN leaves and closes the door .
REGGIE: I do n't know . Perhaps he met somebody .
GRANDPIERRE: Obviously . One ticket of passage to South America one letter , stamped but unsealed , addressed to you
REGGIE: A letter ? May I see it ?
GRANDPIERRE: We took the liberty of calling you dentist we thought , perhaps , we would learn something .
REGGIE: Did you ?
GRANDPIERRE: Yes . Your appointment has been changed . One key to your apartment one comb one fountain pen one toothbrush one tin of tooth powde that is all .
REGGIE: Is that all ? Can I go now ?
GRANDPIERRE: One more question . Is this you husband 's passport ?
REGGIE: Of course it is .
GRANDPIERRE: And this ? He hands her another passport .
REGGIE: I do n't understand .
GRANDPIERRE: And this ? And this ?
REGGIE: It 's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now .
REGGIE: What are you doing here ?
PETER: I phoned but nobody answered . I wanted to tell you how sorry I am and to find out if there was anything I could do .
REGGIE: How did you find out ?
PETER: It 's in all the afternoon papers . I 'm very sorry .
REGGIE: Thank you . A silence .
PETER: I rang the bell but I do n't think it 's working .
REGGIE: Yes it is I heard it this morning .
PETER: Where did everything go ?
REGGIE: Charles sold it all at auction .
PETER: Do you know what you 're going to do ?
REGGIE: Try and get my old job back at UNESCO , I suppose .
PETER: Doing what ?
REGGIE: I 'm a simultaneous translator like Sylvie , only she 's English to French I 'm French to English . That 's what I did before I married Charles . The police probably think I killed him .
PETER: Instant divorce you mean ?
REGGIE: Something like that . But I 'm sorry it ended like this tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail .
PETER: Come on . You ca n't stay here .
REGGIE: I do n't know where to go .
PETER: We 'll find you a hotel .
REGGIE: Not too expensive I 'm not a lady of leisure anymore .
PETER: Something modest but clean and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains okay ?
REGGIE: I loved this room but Charles never saw it only what was in it . All those exquisite things I think I prefer it like this .
SYLVIE: Did n't Charles have any friends ?
REGGIE: Do n't ask me I 'm only the widow . If Charles had died in bed we would n't even have him .
SYLVIE: At least he knows how to behave at funerals .
REGGIE: Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name now it turns out I did n't even know that .
SYLVIE: Do you know him ?
REGGIE: I 've never seen him before .
SYLVIE: He must have known Charles pretty well .
REGGIE: How can you tell ?
SYLVIE: He 's allergic to him .
TEX: Ariva durchy , Charlie .
TEX: Miz Lampert , ma'am
REGGIE: Yes ?
TEX: Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way . He sure did n't . No siree .
REGGIE: I do n't understa
REGGIE: Merci , Monsieur .
ATTENDANT: Pas du tout , madame , pardon pardon pardon .
SYLVIE: Who is it from ?
REGGIE: The American Embassy .
SYLVIE: What is it about ?
REGGIE: I do n't know . But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I 'm buying a fallout shelter .
REGGIE: Hello ? Hello ?
BARTHOLOMEW: I 'm sorry my secretary must have gone to lunch . You are ?
REGGIE: Mrs. Lampert Mrs. Charles Lampert .
BARTHOLOMEW: Come in , Mrs. Lampert . You 're quite late .
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew are you sure you know who I am ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Charles Lampert 's widow yes ? Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back .
REGGIE: No thanks .
BARTHOLOMEW: Do you know what C.I.A . is , Mrs. Lampert ?
REGGIE: I do n't suppose it 's an airline , is it ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Central Intelligence Agency C.I.A .
REGGIE: You mean spies and things like that ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Only we call them agents .
REGGIE: We ? You mean you 're ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Someone has to do it , Mrs. Lampert
REGGIE: I 'm sorry , it 's just that I did n't think that you people were supposed to admit
BARTHOLOMEW: I 'm not an agent , Mrs. Lampert I 'm an administrator a desk jockey trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds . Congress seems to think that all a spy needs
REGGIE: Agent .
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes That all he needs is a code ook and a cyanide pill and he 's in usiness .
REGGIE: What 's all this got to do with me , Mr. Bartholomew ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government .
REGGIE: May I have a sandwich , please ?
BARTHOLOMEW: To be more specific , he was wanted y this agency .
REGGIE: So that was it .
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes . We knew him , of course , by his eal name .
REGGIE: His real ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Voss Charles Voss . All right , Mrs. Voss I 'd like you to look at this photograph , please by the way , you saw this one , did n't you ? Scott , Cathy , and Ham , Jr .
REGGIE: Very sweet .
BARTHOLOMEW: Are n't they ? Now look at this one , Mrs. Voss , and
REGGIE: Stop calling me that ! Lampert 's the name on the marriage license .
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes and tell me if you recognize anyone . Just a moment . Have a good look .
REGGIE: Danger ? Why should I be in any danger ?
BARTHOLOMEW: You 're Charles Voss 's wife now that he 's dead you 're their only lead .
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew if you 're trying to frighten me you 're doing a really first-rate job !
BARTHOLOMEW: Please , do what we ask , Mrs. Lampert it 's your only chance .
REGGIE: Gladly , only I do n't know what you want ! You have n't told me .
BARTHOLOMEW: Oh , have n't I ? The money Mrs. Lampert the money . The $ 250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction . Those three men want it , too they want it very badly .
REGGIE: But it 's Charles 's money , not theirs .
BARTHOLOMEW: Oh , Mrs. Lampert ! I 'd love to see you try and convince them of that ! Oh , dear .
REGGIE: Then whose is it ? His or theirs ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Ours .
REGGIE: Oh , I see .
BARTHOLOMEW: And I 'm afraid we want it back .
REGGIE: But I do n't have it .
BARTHOLOMEW: That 's impossible . You 're the only one who could have it .
REGGIE: I 'm sorry it 's impossible . It 's the truth . BARTHOLOMEW is silent for a moment , thinking .
BARTHOLOMEW: I believe you .
REGGIE: Thanks very much .
BARTHOLOMEW: Oh , you 've got the money all right you just do n't know you 've got it .
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew if I had a quarte of a million dollars , believe me , I 'd know it .
BARTHOLOMEW: Nevertheless , Mrs Lampert you 've got it .
REGGIE: You mean it 's just lying around someplace all that cash ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Or a safe deposit key , a certified check , a baggage claim you look for it , Mrs. Lampert I 'm quite sure you 'll find it .
REGGIE: But
BARTHOLOMEW: Look for it , Mrs. Lampert look just as hard and as fast as you can . You may not have a great deal of time . Those men know you have it just as surely as we do . You wo n't e safe until the money 's in ou hands . Is that clear ?
REGGIE: Wait a minute you think those three men killed Charles , do n't you ?
BARTHOLOMEW: We 've no proof , of course , but we ather think so , yes .
REGGIE: Well , there you are ! Charles had the money with him so whoever killed him has it they have it ! BARTHOLOMEW shakes his head .
BARTHOLOMEW: Because they 're still here .
REGGIE: Oh .
BARTHOLOMEW: Like I said , Mrs Lampert I 'm afraid you 're in a great deal of danger . Remember what happened to Charles .
PETER: Reggie ? She turns and looks at him for a moment .
REGGIE: Hallo , Peter .
PETER: You telephoned me to meet you . I 've een standing on the corner back there waiting for you .
REGGIE: I 'm sorry I heard the children laughing .
PETER: What 's going on ?
REGGIE: Do n't you understand French ?
PETER: I 'm still having trouble with English .
REGGIE: The man and the woman are married
PETER: Of course ? I thought he was dead .
REGGIE: He 's only pretending , to teach her a lesson only only he is dead , Peter I saw him he 's not pretending . Somebody threw him off a train . What am I going to do ? Charles was mixed up in something terrible .
PETER: I wish you 'd let me help you . Whateve it is , it does n't sound like the sort of thing that a woman can handle all by herself .
REGGIE: Starting tonight ?

PETER: What are you doing in here ?
REGGIE: Having a nervous breakdown .
PETER: You have n't said a word since we left the club what happened back there ?
REGGIE: I I 'm not sure if I 'm supposed to tell you or not .
PETER: I do n't think I follow you .
REGGIE: He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me .
PETER: Who said ?
REGGIE: That 's what I 'm not supposed to say .
PETER: Stop this nonsense ! If you 're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it .

REGGIE: How do you shave in there ?
PETER: What was it ?
REGGIE: What was what ?
PETER: What your husband was mixed up in .
REGGIE: Look , I know it 's asking you to stretch your imagination , but ca n't you pretend for a moment that I 'm a woman and that you 're a
PETER: Do n't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a mino above the first floor ? The elevator stops .
REGGIE: Where ?
PETER: On the street where you live .
REGGIE: How about once more around the park ? He reaches across her and opens the door .
PETER: Out .
REGGIE: Him 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap , Reggie ? ' Her 'Well it is awfully late . ' Him 'Just one , all right ? ' Her 'Promise you 'll ehave yourself . ' Him 'Sorry , baby , I never make promises I ca n't keep . '
PETER: How would you like a spanking ?
REGGIE: How would you like a punch in the nose ? Stop treating me like a child .
PETER: Then stop acting like one . If you 're eally in some kind of trouble , I 'd like to hear about it . Otherwise , it 's late , I 'm tired and I 'm going home to bed .

REGGIE: Peter are you all right ?
PETER: I think I sprained my pride . Where 'd he go ?
REGGIE: Out of the window , I guess I did n't see him .
PETER: Lock the door and the window and do n't let anyone in except me . I 'll e back in a minute .
REGGIE: Be careful , Peter .
PETER: You took the words right out of my mouth . He climbs out .
GIDEON: That was a dumb move , Herman a dumb move .
TEX: And then some . If you 'd only told us you was goin ' to her room we could 've kept 'em busy
PETER: I did n't hurt you , did I ? SCOBIE shakes his head and turns away .
GIDEON: Never mind that did you get the money ?
PETER: How could I with the three Marx Brothers breathing down my neck ? You said you 'd let me handle it alone ! The girl trusts me . If she 's got it , I 'll find out about it . But you 've got to leave me alone .
SCOBIE: We took all the chances . The money elongs to us , not him !
TEX: Do n't be un-neighborly-like , Herman do n't forget he done us a little ol ' favor .
SCOBIE: Yeah ? What 's that ?
TEX: He took care of Charlie for us .
GIDEON: We appreciate it , really we do .
SCOBIE: But who asked him ? Three shares are enough I 'd say he 's out !
PETER: A third of nothing is nothing , Herman . Make up your minds she 's waiting for me .
GIDEON: I do n't see how another twenty-fou hours could hurt .
TEX: Shoot no , not after all these years .
SCOBIE: Then he gets it out of your share , not mine ! Not mine !
GIDEON: I suggest you get about your business nothing soothes Herman like success .
TEX: That 's right it 's like ticklin ' a alligator 's belly .
PETER: Who 's got the room next to hers ?
TEX: Me . How come ?
PETER: Get another one , will you ? I 'm going to need it . PETER starts for the door .
TEX: If you do find the money you wo n't forget t ' tell us about it , will you , fella ?
PETER: Do n't worry .
TEX: Oh , I ai n't worryin ' but see this pudgy little fella here ? He worries an ' he 's even meaner ' n I am .
REGGIE: Who is it ?
PETER: There was no trace of him . All right , Reggie suppose you tell me what this is all about .
REGGIE: There are three men he 's one of them they think I have something that belongs to them .
PETER: What ?
REGGIE: A quarter of a million dollars . PETER is silent for a moment .
PETER: Go on .
REGGIE: That 's all .
PETER: No , it is n't where 's the money ?
REGGIE: I do n't know . Those men killed Charles to get it . But he must not have had it with him on the train .
PETER: So they think he left it with you .
REGGIE: But he did n't ! I 've looked everywhere And if I do n't find it Those men going to kill me . She falls in his arms to be comforted .
PETER: No , they wo n't I wo n't let them .
REGGIE: Please help me , Peter you 're the only one I can trust .
PETER: Of course I 'll help I told you I would , did n't I ? Come on now
REGGIE: I 'm so hungry I could faint . I 've I 've gotten your suit all wet .
PETER: That 's all right it 's a drip-dry .
REGGIE: Peter , you 've got to promise me something . Promise you 'll never lie the way Charles did . Why do people have to tell lies ?
PETER: Usually it 's because they want something and they 're afraid the truth wo n't get it for them .
REGGIE: Do you tell lies ? A pause . The phone rings . REGGIE answers it .
SCOBIE: Mrs. Lampert ? it 's me the man who was in your room a few minutes ago
REGGIE: What do you want ?
PETER: Who is it ?
REGGIE: The man you had the fight with .
SCOBIE: Is Dyle with you ?
REGGIE: Who ?
SCOBIE: The man who hit me , lady Dyle that 's his name . What 's wrong is he still there ?
REGGIE: Yes that 's right .
PETER: What is it , Reggie what 's he saying ? She shakes her head .
SCOBIE: Do n't trust him do n't tell him anything . He 's after the money . He hangs up .
PETER: What 'd he say ?
REGGIE: He he said if I did n't give the money , he 'll kill me .
PETER: I would n't take that too seriously .
REGGIE: I believe what he said .
PETER: They 're only trying to scare you , that 's all .
REGGIE: How do you know what they 're doing ?
PETER: I do n't but as long as they think you have the money , or know where it is , or have it without knowing where it is , or do n't even know you have it
REGGIE: What are you talking about ?
PETER: You must n't let what he said bothe you . It was only words .
REGGIE: Words can hurt very much .
PETER: Go to sleep I 'll see you in the morning .
REGGIE: Do n't put yourself out .
PETER: Hey I 'm on your side . Remembe that .
REGGIE: Yes , I 'll remember . Good night .
PETER: Good night .
REGGIE: But I am calm , Mr. Bartholomew what I called to tell you was there 's someone else someone who was n't in that photograph you showed me . He says his name is Peter Joshua but it is n't it 's Dyle . Mr. Bartholomew ? are you still there ?
BARTHOLOMEW: I do n't know who this Mr. Dyle is , ut it 's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband .
REGGIE: You mean he might have Mr. Bartholomew , I 'm catching the next plane out of here I 'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me !
BARTHOLOMEW: Where are you now can you meet me ? Do you know Les Halles ?
REGGIE: Yes , where ? in fifteen minutes . I 'll be there .
DYLE: Reggie ! He starts after her .
REGGIE: Taxi !
DYLE: Taxi ! Taxi ! It pulls up and DYLE opens the door .
DRIVER: Comment ?
DYLE: Taxi ! Follow !
DRIVER: Je ne comprends rien .
DYLE: Suivre el taxi !
DRIVER: Ah ! Oui , Monsieur .
REGGIE: Aux Halles vite !
BARTHOLOMEW: Incredible , is n't it ? Zola called it 'le ventre de Paris ' the womb of Paris , the belly . She takes a banana from a nearby stall .
REGGIE: What did you want to see me about , Mr. Bartholomew ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Were you followed ?
REGGIE: Yes , but I lost him . I really did it quite brilliantly . I 'm beginning to think women make the best spies .
BARTHOLOMEW: Agents .
REGGIE: He has a gun , Mr. Bartholomew I saw it .
BARTHOLOMEW: Who ?
REGGIE: Dyle , or whatever his name is .
BARTHOLOMEW: What does your Mr. Dyle look like , Mrs. Lampert ?
REGGIE: He 's hardly my Mr. Dyle .
BARTHOLOMEW: Describe him .
REGGIE: Well he 's tall over six feet ather thin in good physical shape , I 'd say dark eyes quite handsome , really .
BARTHOLOMEW: No .
REGGIE: No , what ?
BARTHOLOMEW: That 's not Carson Dyle .
REGGIE: Carson ?
BARTHOLOMEW: There 's only one Dyle connected with this affair , Mrs. Lampert that 's Carson .
REGGIE: You mean you 've known about him all along ? Why did n't you tell me ?
BARTHOLOMEW: It 's enough to make you a vegetarian , is n't it ?
REGGIE: It 's just lucky that I 'm not hanging next to one of those things right now .
BARTHOLOMEW: I did n't see any point . Dyle 's dead .
REGGIE: Dead ? Mr. Bartholomew maybe you 'd etter tell me what this thing 's all about .
BARTHOLOMEW: I suppose you 're old enough to have heard of World War Two ?
REGGIE: Barely , yes .
BARTHOLOMEW: In 1944 , five members of the O.S.S . the military espionage unit were ordered behind the German lines fo the purpose of delivering $ 250,000 in gold to the French Underground . The five men A WAITER arrives .
WAITER: Vous désirez ?
REGGIE: They always do that .
BARTHOLOMEW: Café .
REGGIE: Gratinée , choucroute garnie , salade de pommes et un ballon de rouge .
BARTHOLOMEW: Mrs. Lampert , I really had n't planned on spending the entire night here .
REGGIE: Can I at least keep the onion soup ? BARTHOLOMEW shrugs .
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes . The five men . They were , of course , your husband , Charles , the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday , and Carson Dyle . But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact . It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money .
REGGIE: Steal it how ?
BARTHOLOMEW: By burying it , and then reporting that the Germans had captured it . All they had to do was come back after the war , dig it up and split it five ways a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked .
REGGIE: May I have a cigarette , please ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried then , efore they could get out , they were ambushed by a German patrol . A machine gun separated Scobie from his right hand and caught Carson Dyle full in the stomach .
REGGIE: Oh . Nothing , I guess . What happened then ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Have you any idea what these things cost over here ?
REGGIE: Please go on , Mr. Bartholomew what happened then ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Scobie was able to travel , but Carson Dyle was clearly dying , so they
WAITER: La soupe , c'est pour qui ?
REGGIE: Pour moi . Go on , Mr. Bartholomew .
BARTHOLOMEW: Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him . They finally got back to the base , made their report , and waited for the war to end . Only Charles could n't wait quite as long as the others . He beat them back to the gold , took everything for himself and disappeared . It 's taken Gideon , Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again .
REGGIE: But if they stole all that money why ca n't you arrest them ?
BARTHOLOMEW: We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together but we still have no proof .
REGGIE: But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O . ?
BARTHOLOMEW: C.I.A. , Mrs. Lampert . We 're an extension of the wartime O.S.S . It was our money and we want it back .
REGGIE: I 'm sorry , Mr. Bartholomew , but nothing you 've told me has changed my mind . I still intend leaving Paris tonight .
BARTHOLOMEW: I would n't advise that , Mrs. Lampert . You 'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave . Those men wo n't be very fa away no matter where you go . In fact , I do n't even see any point in your changing hotels . Please help us , Mrs. Lampert . Your government is counting on you .
REGGIE: Well , if I 'm going to die , I might as well do it for my country .
BARTHOLOMEW: That 's the spirit .
REGGIE: Oh , stop it . What do you want me to do ?
BARTHOLOMEW: We 're anxious to know who this man is the one calling himself Dyle .
REGGIE: Maybe he really is Dyle . He could still be alive .
BARTHOLOMEW: No , Mrs. Lampert .
REGGIE: But no one actually saw him die .
BARTHOLOMEW: No , Mrs. Lampert . His death is egistered with the War Department in Washington .
REGGIE: Oh . Then who 's this one ?
BARTHOLOMEW: I do n't know but I think you 'd etter find out , do n't you ?
REGGIE: Me ? Why me ?
BARTHOLOMEW: You 're in an ideal position he trusts you . Besides , you said yourself , women make the best spies .
REGGIE: Agents .
TOURIST: Fraulein REGGIE does n't stop .
REGGIE: What are you doing , following me ? Stop it we 're going to look like a parade .
TOURIST: Fraulein REGGIE pulls away from him .
REGGIE: If you do n't stop following me I 'll call the police .
DYLE: Dyle , please D - Y - L - E .
CLERK: Yes , Mr. Dyle . I remember .
DYLE: Thanks see you soon .
REGGIE: Good morning , Mr. Dyle .
DYLE: Reggie ?
REGGIE: It 's the only name I 've got . How about you ?
DYLE: No cat and mouse you 've got me . What do you want to know ?
REGGIE: Why you lied to me .
DYLE: I had to for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing .
REGGIE: Well , you know now , so please tell me who you are .
DYLE: But you know my name it 's Dyle .
REGGIE: Carson Dyle is dead .
DYLE: Yes , he is . He was my brother .
REGGIE: Your
DYLE: The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans , but I think they did it Tex , Gideon and Scobie and your husband because he would n't go along with their scheme to steal the gold . I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him . I 'm trying to prove it . They think I 'm working with them . But I 'm not , and that 's the truth . I 'm on your side , Reggie please elieve that .
REGGIE: How can I ? You lied to me the way Charles did and after promising you would n't . Oh , I want to believe you , Peter oh , but I ca n't call you that anymore , can I ? It will take me a while to get used to you new name which I do n't even know yet . What is it ? Are n't you going to tell me ? Hello ?
SCOBIE: If you do anything funny , or try to talk to anyone , I 'll kill you , Dyle here and now . Okay ?
DYLE: You 'll wreck your raincoat .
SCOBIE: Next car , please .
SCOBIE: Okay turn around .
DYLE: What now ?
SCOBIE: We wait with our mouths shut .
DYLE: How long do you intend ?
SCOBIE: I said with the mouth shut . DYLE yawns wide .
DYLE: Sorry about that .
SCOBIE: Okay up there .
DYLE: Do I knock or something ?
SCOBIE: Open it . DYLE opens the door . The stairs continue up .
DYLE: The view had better be worth it .
SCOBIE: I 'll give you a chance , Dyle which is more than you 'd give me . Where 's the money ?
DYLE: Is that why you dragged me all the way up here to ask me that ? She has it you know that .
SCOBIE: And I say maybe you both have it ! One more time , Dyle where is it ?
DYLE: Supposing I did have it which I do n't do you really think I 'd hand it over ?
SCOBIE: You 're out , Dyle right now !
DYLE: Back where ?
SCOBIE: That 's the idea .
DYLE: Herman ?
SCOBIE: Yeah ?
DYLE: How are you doing ?
MANAGER: The next time madame forgets he key , there is another one at the desk . DYLE smiles , then enters his room .
REGGIE: Is that you ?
DYLE: I met a man with sharp nails .
REGGIE: Scobie ?
DYLE: I left him hanging around the American Express .
REGGIE: Come on I 've got something that stings like crazy . She leads him into her room .
DYLE: Listen all I really want is an estimate .
REGGIE: It 's not so bad . You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days ut , then , you can lie from any position , ca n't you ?
DYLE: Have n't you got a bullet I can bite ?
REGGIE: Are you really Carson Dyle 's brother ?
DYLE: Would you like to see my passport ?
REGGIE: Your passport ! What kind of a proof is that ?
DYLE: Would you like to see where I was tattooed ?
REGGIE: Sure .
DYLE: Okay , I 'll drive you around there some day . Ouch !
REGGIE: Ha ha . You could at least tell me what your first name is these days .
DYLE: Alexander .
REGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Dyle ?
DYLE: Yes , but we 're divorced .
REGGIE: I thought that was Peter Joshua .
DYLE: I 'm no easier to live with than he was .
REGGIE: There you 're a new man .
DYLE: I 'm sorry I could n't tell you the truth , but I had to find out you part in all this .
REGGIE: Alex how can you tell if someone is lying or not ?
DYLE: You ca n't .
REGGIE: There must be some way .
DYLE: There 's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie . So one day you meet an Indian , you ask him if he 's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot ? He tells you he 's a truthful Whitefoot , ut which one is he ?
REGGIE: Why could n't you just look at his feet ?
DYLE: Because he 's wearing moccasins .
REGGIE: Oh . Well , then he 's a truthful Whitefoot , of course .
DYLE: Why not a lying Blackfoot ?
REGGIE: Which one are you ?
DYLE: Whitefoot , of course .
REGGIE: Come here . He goes to the bed .
DYLE: Reggie listen to me
REGGIE: Oh-oh here it comes . The fatherly talk . You forget I 'm already a widow .
DYLE: So was Juliet at fifteen .
REGGIE: I 'm not fifteen .
DYLE: Well , there 's your trouble right there you 're too old for me .
REGGIE: Why ca n't you be serious ?
DYLE: There , you said it .
REGGIE: Said what ?
DYLE: Serious . When a man gets to be my age that 's the last word he eve wants to hear . I do n't want to be serious and I especially do n't want you to be .
REGGIE: Okay I 'll tell you what we 'll just sit around all day long being frivolous how about that ?
DYLE: Now please , Reggie cut it out .
REGGIE: Okay .
DYLE: What are you doing ?
REGGIE: Cutting it out .
DYLE: Who told you to do that ?
REGGIE: You did .
DYLE: But I 'm not through complaining yet .
REGGIE: Oh .
DYLE: Now please , Reggie cut it out .
REGGIE: I think I love you , Alex
DYLE: The phone 's ringing
REGGIE: Whoever it is wo n't give up and neither will I .
TEX: Miz Lampert , my buddies ' n me , we 'd oblige it mighty highly if you could mosey on across the hall ' n chew the fat with us for a spell .
REGGIE: Can you give me one good reason why I should ?
TEX: Yes , ma'am . A little one 'bout seven or eight years old . Th ' little tyke keeps callin ' you his Aunt Reggie ai n't that cute ?
REGGIE: They 've got Jean-Louis !
DYLE: That sounds like their problem .
REGGIE: I 'll be right there .
TEX: We 'll be waitin ' in room forty-seven , Miz Lampert so you just wiggle on over .
REGGIE: What day is it ?
DYLE: Tuesday .
REGGIE: Lord , I forgot all about it Sylvie works late Tuesday nights she always leaves him with me . They would n't do anything to a little oy , would they ?
DYLE: I do n't know it depends on whethe or not they 've already eaten .
SCOBIE: Hey , Tex move the kid to the othe knee or something , will you ? My leg 's going to sleep .
TEX: Upsy-daisy .
GIDEON: Will you put that thing away !
REGGIE: Jean-Louis ! She snatches him off SCOBIE 's lap .
TEX: Howdy , Miz Lampert .
SCOBIE: Who invited you ?
DYLE: Hello , Herman , it was a happy landing , I see .
REGGIE: I 'd better call Sylvie she must e frantic .
GIDEON: I 'm afraid that will have to wait , Mrs. Lampert .
REGGIE: But his mother
GIDEON: She is n't going to be anybody 's mothe unless you answer some questions .
TEX: This ai n't no game , Miz Lampert .
SCOBIE: We want that money now !
DYLE: Be quiet , all of you !
SCOBIE: Then who does ?
DYLE: I do n't know , Herman maybe you do .
SCOBIE: Me ?
DYLE: Or you Or you
SCOBIE: That 's a crock ! If one of us did that he would n't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up .
DYLE: But he 'd have to . If he left he 'd be admitting his guilt and the others would know what happened . Whoever it is has to wait here , pretending to look for the money , waiting for the est of us to give up and go home . That 's when he 'll be safe and not a minute before . A pause as the THREE MEN look at one another .
GIDEON: Up till now we always figured she had the money but you know so much about it , maybe you 've got it .
DYLE: Then what am I doing here ? You did n't know anything about me I 'm the only one who could have taken it and kept right on going .
SCOBIE: He 's just tryin ' to throw us off ! They 've got it , I tell you ! Why do n't we search their rooms ?
DYLE: It 's all right with us
TEX: What are we wastin ' time for ? Let 's go .
DYLE: And while we 're waiting , we might as well go through yours .
SCOBIE: Not my room !
DYLE: What 's wrong , Herman have you got something to hide ? Then I take it there are no objections . The THREE MEN look at one another unhappily .
SCOBIE: I 'll take that .
TEX: Mine 's in the door . Ariva durchy , y'all .
DYLE: Come on let 's get busy . Who gets your vote ?
REGGIE: Scobie he 's the one that objected .
DYLE: He 's all yours . I 'll do Tex and Gideon . Take Jean-Louis with you and make sure you bolt the door from inside .
REGGIE: Viens , Jean-Louis we 're going to have a treasure hunt .
DYLE: How about $ 25,000 ? Or do you think it would spoil him ?
GIDEON: Tex ?
TEX: What 's that ?
GIDEON: What for ? If it 's not here , why bothe him ?
TEX: And if it is ?
GIDEON: Why bother him ?
TEX: You sure nuthin 's missin ' ?
GIDEON: No . The police have kindly provided us with a list .
TEX: There sure ai n't nothin ' here worth no quarter of a million .
GIDEON: Not unless we 're blind .
TEX: You think that mebbe we 're fishin ' the wrong stream ?
GIDEON: Meaning what ?
TEX: You do n't s'pose one o ' us has it , like the man said I mean , that 'd e pretty distasteful us bein ' vet'rans o ' the same war ' n ' all .
GIDEON: You know I 'd tell you if I had it .
TEX: Nachurly . Jus ' like I 'd tell you .
GIDEON: Nachurly . And that goes for Herman , too .
REGGIE: He 's all right , Sylvie , honestly . Just hurry up and get here . She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS .
DYLE: Reggie ? Did you find it ?
REGGIE: No .
GIDEON: What do you mean , no ?
TEX: The kid said
REGGIE: No , Jean-Louis .
REGGIE: Where is he ? The MEN look at one another .
TEX: Hey , that 's right !
DYLE: He 's in my room .
TEX: Now who'da done a mean thing like that ?
DYLE: I 'm not quite sure .
TEX: This ai n't my room .
GIDEON: Mine , either .
DYLE: The police are n't going to like this one bit .
GIDEON: We could dry him off and take him down the hall to his own room . He really does n't look so bad .
TEX: We could put him to bed ' n let one o ' them fem-de-chambers find him in the mornin ' . DYLE and GIDEON look at one another .
GRANDPIERRE: No ! No ! No ! No !
DYLE: Dyle .
GRANDPIERRE: And yet you registered in Megeve as Mr. Joshua . Do you know it is against the law to register under an assumed name ?
DYLE: No , I did n't .
REGGIE: It 's done in America all the time .
GRANDPIERRE: None of you will be permitted to leave Paris until this matter is cleared up . Only I warn you I will be watching . We use the guillotine in this country I have always suspected that the blade coming down causes no more than a slight tickling sensation on the back of the neck . It is only a guess , of course I hope none of you eve finds out for certain .
REGGIE: Who do you think did it Gideon ?
DYLE: Maybe .
REGGIE: Or Tex ?
DYLE: Maybe .
REGGIE: You 're a big help . Can I have one of those ?
DYLE: Why ?
REGGIE: Because I really suspect Gideon and it is always the person you do n't suspect .
DYLE: Do women think it 's feminine to be so illogical or ca n't they help it ?
REGGIE: What 's so illogical about that ?
DYLE: A ) It 's always the person you do n't suspect ; B ) that means you think it 's Tex because you really suspect Gideon ; therefore C ) if you think it 's Tex , it has to be someone else Gideon .
REGGIE: Oh . I guess they just ca n't help it .
DYLE: Who ?
REGGIE: Women . You know , I ca n't help feeling ather sorry for Scobie . Would n't it be nice if we were like that ?
DYLE: What like Scobie ?
REGGIE: No Gene Kelly . Remember the way he danced down there next to the iver in 'American in Paris ' without a care in the world ? This is good , want some ?
DYLE: I 'd love some , thanks .
REGGIE: I 'm sorry .
DYLE: No sense messing up the streets .
REGGIE: Alex
DYLE: Hm ?
REGGIE: I 'm scared .
DYLE: Do n't worry , I 'm not going to hit you .
REGGIE: No , about Scobie , I mean . I ca n't think of any reason why he was killed . They resume walking .
DYLE: Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many
REGGIE: What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three ? He wants it all , Alex that means we 're in his way , too .
DYLE: Yes , I know .
REGGIE: First your brother , then Charles , now Scobie we 've got to do something ! Any minute now we could e assassinated ! Would you do anything like that ?
DYLE: What ? Assassinate somebody ?
REGGIE: No
REGGIE: swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love like Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame ' ?
DYLE: Let me know what you want I 'll pick a suit that matches . He goes into his room and she goes into hers .
REGGIE: It 's the house detective why have n't you got a girl in there ?
DYLE: Lord , you 're a pest .
REGGIE: Would n't it be better if you did it in my room ?
DYLE: I 'm only next door if anything happens , holler .
DYLE: Reggie !
REGGIE: Got you .
DYLE: Did you ever hear the story of the oy who cried wolf ?
REGGIE: The shower 's in there .
DYLE: Reggie open the door .
REGGIE: This is a ludicrous situation . There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower .
DYLE: Then I suggest you call one of them .
REGGIE: I dare you .
DYLE: Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on ? What a nut .
REGGIE: Shut the door !
DYLE: I do n't think I know that one .
REGGIE: What on earth are you doing ?
DYLE: Drip-dry !
REGGIE: How often do you go through this little ritual ?
DYLE: Every day . The manufacturer recommends it .
REGGIE: I do n't believe it . He opens his coat and reads a label inside .
DYLE: `` Wearing this suit during washing will help protect its shape . ''
REGGIE: Yes ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Mrs. Lampert ? Bartholomew . I 've spoken to Washington , Mrs. Lampert
REGGIE: Go ahead , Mr. Bartholomew I 'm listening .
BARTHOLOMEW: I told them what you said about this man being Carson Dyle 's brother . I asked them what they knew about it and they told me you 're not gon na like this , Mrs. Lampert they told me Carson Dyle has no brother .
REGGIE: Are you sure there 's no mistake ?
BARTHOLOMEW: None whatsoever . Please , Mrs. Lampert e careful .
DYLE: I left all my drip-dry dripping is it all right ? She does n't answer .
REGGIE: Do you mind if we go someplace crowded ? I I feel like lots of people tonight .
DYLE: Reggie you have n't spoken a word in twenty minutes .
REGGIE: I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie and the one who 's going to e next me ?
DYLE: Nothing 's going to happen to you while I 'm around I want you to elieve that .
REGGIE: How can I believe it when you do n't even know who the killer is ? I 've got that right , have n't I ? You do n't know who did it .
DYLE: No not yet .
REGGIE: But then if we sit back and wait , the field should start narrowing down , should n't it ? Whoever 's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination , would n't you say so ?
DYLE: Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie ? She does n't answer .
REGGIE: It 's a start , anyway .
DYLE: I do n't understand you at all one minute you 're chasing me around the shower room and the next you 're accusing me of murder .
REGGIE: Carson Dyle did n't have a brother .
DYLE: I can explain if you 'll just listen . Will you listen ?
REGGIE: I ca n't very well leave without a pair of water wings .
DYLE: Okay . Then get set for the story of my life not that it would eve make the best-seller list .
REGGIE: Fiction or non-fiction ?
DYLE: Why do n't you shut up !
REGGIE: Well !
DYLE: Are you going to listen ?
REGGIE: Go on .
DYLE: After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business . Umbrella frames that 's what he made . It was a sensible business , I suppose , but I did n't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible .
REGGIE: I suppose all this is leading somewhere ?
DYLE: It led me away from umbrella frames , for one thing . But that left me without any honest means of support .
REGGIE: What do you mean ?
DYLE: When a man has no profession except the one he loathes , what 's left ? I egan looking for people with more money than they 'd ever need including some they 'd barely miss .
REGGIE: You mean , you 're a thief ?
DYLE: Well , it is n't exactly the term I 'd have chosen , but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing .
REGGIE: I do n't believe it .
DYLE: Well , I ca n't really blame you not now .
REGGIE: But I do believe it that 's what I do n't believe . So it 's goodbye Alexander Dyle Welcome home Pete Joshua .
DYLE: Sorry , the name 's Adam Canfield .
REGGIE: Adam Canfield . Wonderful . Do you ealize you 've had three names in the past two days ? I do n't even know who I 'm talking to any more .
DYLE: The man 's the same , even if the name is n't .
REGGIE: No he 's not the same . Alexande Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother 's death . Adam Canfield is a crook . And with all the advantages you 've got brains , charm , education , a handsome face
ADAM: Oh , come on !
REGGIE: there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do . I want to know what it is .
ADAM: It 's simple . I like what I do I enjoy doing it . There are n't many men who love their work as much as I do . Look around some time .
REGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Canfield ?
ADAM: Yes , but
REGGIE: I could eat a horse .
ADAM: I think that 's what you ordered .
REGGIE: Do n't you dare to be civil with me ! All this time you were leading me on
ADAM: How was I leading you on ?
REGGIE: All that marvelous rejection you knew I could n't resist it . Now it turns out you were only interested in the money .
ADAM: That 's right .
REGGIE: No I guess not .
ADAM: It 's a toss-up , I can tell you that .
REGGIE: What ?
ADAM: Do n't you know I 'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you ? REGGIE reacts in surprise .
REGGIE: What about it ?
ADAM: It 's lovely .
REGGIE: I 'm not hungry is n't it glorious ? The lights go out .
ADAM: It 's all right look .
REGGIE: You do n't look so bad in this light .
ADAM: Why do you think I brought you here ?
REGGIE: I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out .
ADAM: Pretty good , huh ? I taught them everything they do .
REGGIE: Oh ? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day ?
ADAM: How do you think I got here ?
REGGIE: Are n't you allowed to kiss back ?
ADAM: No . The doctor said it would be bad for my thermostat .
REGGIE: Well come on .
ADAM: Relax you 're gaining .
GIDEON: Huh ? You must be crazy it 's three- thirty in the morning you mean now ? all right I 'll be down in a minute .
GRANDPIERRE: Three of them all in their pajamas ! C'est ridicule ! What is it , some new American fad ?
ADAM: I do n't know .
GRANDPIERRE: Madame ? REGGIE shrugs .
ADAM: In my room , asleep .
GRANDPIERRE: And you , Mrs. Lampert ?
REGGIE: I was , too .
GRANDPIERRE: In Mr. Dyle 's room ?
REGGIE: No in my room .
GRANDPIERRE: It stands to reason you are telling the truth for why would you invent such a ridiculous story ? REGGIE and ADAM exchange looks .
ADAM: That wraps it up Tex has the money . Go back to bed I 'll let you know when I 've found him .
REGGIE: You 're going to look for him now ?
ADAM: If the police find him first they 're not very likely to turn over a quarte of a million dollars to us , are they ?
REGGIE: Adam
ADAM: There 's no time I 'll call you in the morning . ADAM disappears into his own room .
TEX: Now Dyle , you listen to me my mama did n't raise no stupid children . I know who 's got the money ' n I ai n't disappearing till I got my share ' n ' my share 's growin ' a whole lot igger ev'ry day .
ADAM: Where are you , ol ' buddy ?
TEX: I 'll tell you what , fella you want t ' find me , you jus ' turn 'round from now on I 'll be right behind you .
REGGIE: What is it ?
ADAM: Open up .
REGGIE: Why ?
ADAM: I just heard from him he 's still hungry . That means killing Gideon did n't get it for him so he 's narrowed it down to us . You 've got it .
REGGIE: I 've looked , Adam you know I have
ADAM: Where 's that airlines bag ?
REGGIE: Lord , you 're stubborn .
ADAM: I sure am . Get it . She goes to the closet and gets the bag .
REGGIE: But everyone and his Aunt Lilian 's een through that bag . Somebody would have seen it .
ADAM: Let 's look anyway .
REGGIE: Lord , you 're stubborn .
ADAM: I mean , it 's there , Reggie . If only we could see it . We 're looking at it ight now .
REGGIE: To the apartment it matches mine perfectly .
ADAM: The letter
REGGIE: I 'll bet you do n't really need those .
ADAM: It still does n't make sense , but it is n't worth any quarter of a million either . Have we forgotten anything ?
REGGIE: The tooth powder . Wait a minute could you recognize heroin just by tasting it ?
ADAM: Heroin peppermint-flavored heroin .
REGGIE: Well , I guess that 's it dead end .
ADAM: Go to bed . You 've got to be at work in the morning . There 's nothing more we can do tonight .
REGGIE: I love you , Adam .
ADAM: Yes , you told me .
REGGIE: No last time I said `` I love you , Alex . ''
ITALIAN DELEGATE: di conseguenza , il Governo Italiano è decisamente a favore pe l'incoraggiamento , in accordo con le tradizioni etniche rispettive delle culture basilari dei passi in via di sviluppo . Per esempio , pregare i Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro isaie ed ai loro campi di soja tradizionali una raccolta di semola , non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro secolari tradizioni ma , oltre tutto , e questo è molto importante per il Governo che io ho l'onore di appresentare disturberebbe l'esportazione delle derrate farinose italiane in questa parte del mondo . Signori Delegati vi ringrazio della vostra attenzione .
REGGIE: I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night it 's just not safe fo him to be around me right now .
SYLVIE: Do n't be silly he would not do anything . He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls . He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age .
REGGIE: Hold it Italy just finished . They 're recognizing Great Britain .
SYLVIE: Oh la vache !
BRITISH DELEGATE: Mr. Chairman , fellow delegates my distinguished colleague from Italy . Her Majesty 's delegation has listened with great patience to the Southern European position on this problem , and while we find it charmingly stated , we can not possibly agree with its content . In 1937 , in the British colonies of Kenya , Uganda and Tanganyika and , if I 'm not mistaken , more or less in Somaliland a programme of crop rotation was instituted vis-à-vis arable land which had never before known the plough , beginning before the soil was able to know the sort of fatigue now plaguing most of Western Europe . In 1937 , therefore , Her Majesty 's Government at that time His Majesty 's Government was able to properly assay the situation . We therefore oppose the resolution .
ADAM: Reggie I think I 've found are you on ?
REGGIE: No , it 's all right . What 's wrong , Adam ?
ADAM: Nothing 's wrong . I think I found something . I was snooping around Tex 's room and I found this in the waste basket . I 've stuck it back together . He hands her a paper .
REGGIE: You 're right . I remember Grandpierre looking through it . But there was nothing in it at least , nothing that the police thought was very important .
ADAM: Can you remember anything at all ?
REGGIE: Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had on the day he was killed .
ADAM: With whom ? Where ?
REGGIE: I think it only said where but I ca n't
ADAM: Think , Reggie , you 've got to think it may be what we 're looking for .
REGGIE: That money 's not ours , Adam if we keep it , we 'll be breaking the law .
ADAM: Nonsense . We did n't steal it . There 's no law against stealing stolen money .
REGGIE: Of course there is !
ADAM: There is ? Well , I ca n't say I think very much of a silly law like that . Think , Reggie please think what was written in Charles ' notebook ?
REGGIE: Well it was a place a street corner , I think . But I do n't Hold it . I 'm on .
FRENCH DELEGATE: Monsieur le Président , Messieurs les délégués mon distingué collègue de la Grande Bretagne le problème vu par mon Gouvernement n'est pas aussi simple que nos amis les Anglais voudraient nous le faire croire . Mais leur pays n'est pas , après tout , un pays agricole , n'est-ce pas ? La position française , ainsi que nous l'avons soulignée dans le rapport numéro trente-neuf bar oblique cinquante-deux de la Conférence de l'hémisphère occidental qui a eu lieu le 22 mars
REGGIE: as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March

REGGIE: But Charles ' appointment was last week , not
ADAM: I know , but this is all we 've got left .
REGGIE: Well , you 're right there . Ten minutes ago I had a job .
ADAM: Stop grousing . If we find the money I 'll buy you an international conference all your own . Now start looking . You take this side and I 'll poke around over there .
REGGIE: It 's hopeless I do n't even know what we 're looking for .
ADAM: It 's all right I do n't think Tex does , either .
REGGIE: Tex ? You mean he 's here , too ?
ADAM: Look .
REGGIE: Be careful , Adam please . He 's already killed three men .
TEX: Sorry , fella
ADAM: The letter . He quickly turns to find TEX .
ADAM: All right where 's the letter ?
TEX: The letter ? The letter ai n't worth nuthin ' .
ADAM: You know what I mean the envelope with the stamps . I want it .
TEX: You greenhorn you half-witted , thick-skulled , hare-brained , greenhorn ! They wuz both too smart for us !
ADAM: What are you talking about ?
TEX: First her husband , now her she hoodwinked you ! She batted all them ig eyes and you went ' n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken ! Here ! You want ? Here it 's yours ! ADAM takes it and looks at it .
REGGIE: Sylvie ? What are you doing here ?
SYLVIE: Hello , Reggie I am waiting fo Jean-Louis .
REGGIE: What 's he up to ?
SYLVIE: He was so excited when he got the stamps you gave him this morning . He said he had never seen any like them .
REGGIE: I 'm glad . But what 's all this ?
SYLVIE: The stamp market , of course it is here every Thursday afternoon . This is where Jean-Louis trades his
REGGIE: Good Lord ! The stamps ! Where is he ? Sylvie we 've got to find him !
SYLVIE: What 's the matter , chérie ?
REGGIE: Those stamps they 're worth a fortune !
SYLVIE: What ?
REGGIE: A fortune ! Hurry we 've got to find him ! They rush off into the market .
SYLVIE: We will separate you look ove there . They go off in opposite directions .
REGGIE: Jean-Louis ! But it is n't .
SYLVIE: Jean-Louis !
REGGIE: Jean-Louis thank heavens ! Do you have ! What 's that ?
SYLVIE: Vite , mon ange vite !
REGGIE: I do n't blame him . Jean-Louis do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives ?
THÉOPHILE: Oui , jeune homme ?
FÉLIX: Entrez .
REGGIE: Monsieur Félix ?
FÉLIX: I was expecting you . You are American too , of course .
REGGIE: Yes .
FÉLIX: The man who bought them last week was American . I did not see him but I heard . I knew you would come .
REGGIE: I 'm I 'm sorry I do n't know anything about stamps .
FÉLIX: I know them as one knows his own face , even though I have never seen them . This yellow one a Swedish four shilling called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen ' issued in 1854 .
REGGIE: How much is it worth ?
FÉLIX: The money is unimportant .
REGGIE: I 'm afraid it is important .
FÉLIX: In your money , perhaps $ 65,000 .
REGGIE: Do you mind if I sit down ? What about the blue one ?
FÉLIX: It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue ' and there are only seven left . In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a ival collector who was obsessed to own it .
REGGIE: What 's its value today ?
FÉLIX: In human life ? In greed ? In suffering ?
REGGIE: In money .
FÉLIX: Forty-five thousand .
REGGIE: Do you have anything to eat ? And the orange one what about the orange one ?
FÉLIX: A two-penny Mauritius issued in 1856 . Not so rare as the others $ 30,000 perhaps .
REGGIE: And the last one ?
FÉLIX: The best for the last le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection . The masterpiece . It is the most valuable stamp in the world . It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne . ' It was printed y hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer . Today it has a value of $ 100,000 . Eh , bien I am not a thief . I knew there was some mistake . Take them .
REGGIE: You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return , Monsieur Félix are they for sale now ?
FÉLIX: Let me see . There are 350 European , 200 Asian , 175 American , 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative which comes to nine francs fifty .
REGGIE: Here 's ten . FÉLIX goes to his wallet for the change .
FÉLIX: I am a tradesman , Madame , not a doorman . And do n't forget these . He hands her the four stamps and her change .
REGGIE: I 'm I 'm sorry .
FÉLIX: No . For a few minutes they were mine that is enough .
REGGIE: Adam ? Adam ? It 's me , Reggie !
REGGIE: Hello Balzac 30-04 , s'il vous plait Mr. Bartholomew ! Thank God you 're there ! Tex is dead , Mr. Bartholomew smothered and Adam did it he killed them all !
BARTHOLOMEW: Just a minute , Mrs. Lampert you 'd etter give that to me slowly . Who 's Adam ?
REGGIE: The one who said he was Dyle 's brother of course I 'm sure Tex wrote the word 'Dyle ' before he died . He 's the murderer I tell you he 's the only one left ! You 've got to do something !
BARTHOLOMEW: Calm down , Mrs. Lampert please . Does he have the money ?
REGGIE: No , I do it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train . They were in plain sight all the time , but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope .
BARTHOLOMEW: The envelope imagine that . Mrs. Lampert , listen to me you 're not safe as long as you 've got these stamps . Go to the Embassy right away wait , I 'd better meet you halfway it 's quicker . Now , let 's see do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal ? yes , by the colonnade as soon as you can get there . Hurry , Mrs. Lampert .
REGGIE: Yes , I 'm leaving now goodbye .
ADAM: Reggie the stamps what 've you done with ? REGGIE starts running downstairs .
REGGIE: Why ? So you can kill me too ? Tex is dead , I 've seen him ! He said Dyle did it !
ADAM: I 'm not Dyle you know that !
REGGIE: But Tex did n't he still thought
ADAM: Do n't be an idiot !
REGGIE: Palais Royal vite !

REGGIE: Mais c'est très vite ! On veut me teur !
DRIVER: Italie .
GUARD: Billet , Monsieur .
ADAM: I do n't want to go anywhere I 'm only trying
GUARD: Billet , Monsieur .

TRAIN GUARD: This car is for first class only you have a second-class ticket .
ADAM: But that 's what they gave me .

REGGIE: No , I ca n't speak any louder Hamilton Bartholomew B as in uh Bartholomew that 's right , and the rest as in Bartholomew !

REGGIE: But someone 's trying to kill me you 've got to send word to him in the center garden of the Palais Royal , y the colonnade tell him I 'm trapped in a phone booth , below him in the Métro station . And my name 's Lampert .
OPERATOR: All right , Mrs. Lampert I 'll see what I can do . Goodbye .
REAL BARTHOLOMEW: Lampert ? I do n't know any Mrs. Lampert trapped in a Métro station ? Who does she think I am , the C.I.A. ? All right , you 'd better call the French police .
ADAM: Reggie ! He takes off , running after her .
REGGIE: I 'm through listening to you !
ADAM: But I did n't kill anybody .
REGGIE: Then who did ? You 're the only one left .
ADAM: Reggie please believe me !
REGGIE: No !
ADAM: Reggie stop ! That 's Carson Dyle !
REGGIE: Carson ?
"BARTHOLOMEW": We all know Carson Dyle is dead , Mrs. Lampert .
ADAM: It 's Carson Dyle , I tell you !
"BARTHOLOMEW": You 're not going to believe him , Mrs. Lampert it 's too fantastic . He 's trying to trick you again .
ADAM: Tex recognized him that 's why he said Dyle . If you give him those stamps , he 'll kill you too ! REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM .
"BARTHOLOMEW": Mrs. Lampert if I 'm who he said , what 's preventing me from killing you right now ? REGGIE stops , turns back to `` BARTHOLOMEW . ''
ADAM: Because he 'd have to come out to get the stamps he knows he 'd neve make it .
"BARTHOLOMEW": What 's the matter with you , Mrs. Lampert ? Are you going to believe every lie he tells you ? He wants the money for himself that 's all he 's ever wanted .
REGGIE: He 's with the C.I.A . I 've seen him at the Embassy .
ADAM: Do n't be a fool ! He 's Carson Dyle !
"BARTHOLOMEW": That 's right , Mrs. Lampert I 'm a dead man look at me .
REGGIE: I do n't know who anybody is any more !
ADAM: Reggie listen to me !
REGGIE: You lied to me so many times
ADAM: Reggie trust me once more please .
REGGIE: Can I really believe you this time , Adam ?
ADAM: There 's not a reason on earth why you should .
REGGIE: All right , Adam .
"BARTHOLOMEW": Stop right now , Mrs. Lampert , o I 'll kill you . REGGIE stops in alarm .
ADAM: It wo n't get you the stamps , Dyle You 'll have to come out to get them , and I 'm not likely to miss at this ange .
"BARTHOLOMEW": Maybe not but it takes a lot of ullets to kill me . They left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach they knew I was still alive but they left me . I spent ten months in a German camp with nothing to stop the pain and no food they were willing to take all these chances for the money , but not fo me . They deserved to die !
CARSON: I 'll give you five to make up you mind , Mrs. Lampert .
REGGIE: Wait , please ! I need some time to think !
CARSON: One
REGGIE: Adam please !
CARSON: All right , Mrs. Lampert . The game 's over . Come out of there .
CARSON: I do n't want to kill you , Mrs. Lampert ut I will
GRANDPIERRE: Mr. Dyle you are under arrest fo the murders of Charles Lampert , Herman Scobie , Joseph Penthollow , Leopold Gideon , and whoever that is down there . ADAM is surprised , then shakes his head .

REGGIE: You did n't have to chase me so hard
ADAM: Here , give it to me .
REGGIE: That one 's done start on this one . He takes the foot and begins rubbing it .
ADAM: And that 's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide .
REGGIE: The truth , now was it my hide or the stamps ?
ADAM: What a terrible thing to say . How could you even think that ?
REGGIE: All right , prove it to me tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps . ADAM says nothing .
ADAM: I heard you , I heard you .
REGGIE: Then say it .
ADAM: Reggie listen to me
REGGIE: Never mind I 'll go by myself .
ADAM: What makes you think they 're even interested ? It 's only a quarter of a million it 'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping . As a taxpayer
REGGIE: Who 's a taxpayer ? Crooks do n't pay taxes . Excuse me , soldier
MARINE: Marine , ma'am .
REGGIE: Forgive me . Whom would I see regarding the return of stolen Government money ?

CRUIKSHANK: We 're not allowed to tell . May I have the stamps , please ?
REGGIE: Here Wait a minute how did Carson Dyle get an office in here , anyway ?
CRUIKSHANK: When did you see him what time , I mean ?
REGGIE: Around one .
CRUIKSHANK: The lunch hour . He probably worked it out in advance . He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here .
REGGIE: Then how do I know this is you office ?
CRUIKSHANK: Mrs. Foster send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that
REGGIE: Bartholomew ?
CRUIKSHANK: recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour .
REGGIE: Starting with his own .
CRUIKSHANK: Okay , now hand over those stamps .

BOSLEY: Computers , hunh ? What do you know about this new browser from Knox Technologies ? Corwin bristles at the mention .
CORWIN: I do n't see that happening .
BOSLEY: Really ? Why not ?
MASSEUSE: Please to take off clothes , Mr. Corvin .
ALEX: You 're carrying a lot of tension along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae . Let me see if I can vork it out .
ALEX: You must have dozed off .
NATALIE: Can you not drive my car so fast , Dyl ? I 'm trying to type .
DYLAN: I drive too fast . Look who 's talking .
NATALIE: Here 's Corwin 's itinerary .
DYLAN: Alright , we 'll hit the reception tonight . I only wish we had a clue to go on . The food comes , Dylan takes it .
NATALIE: Hold that thought .
DYLAN: Sorry .
NATALIE: Check this out . New program I just got from a friend in the Bureau . We take that footage from the kidnapping
DYLAN: Sweet . Now we 've got someone to look for . She hands it to Alex to inspect .
ALEX: Oh yeah . He 'll be easy to spot with that open head wound .
DYLAN: The average investor sees technology stocks as discrete entities , `` This one is up 50 points , this one is down 10 . '' It 's only through derivative analysis that one sees the real power of that sector . A few nods . She makes a good point .
BROKER GUY: Which analysis method do you prefer ? On Dylan . Shit . She tries to stall
DYLAN: Well , there are so many options . I mean , who can say what the one est choice is ?
NATALIE: Keppler-Wilson .
DYLAN: For my money , Keppler-Wilson is a strong choice .
NATALIE: Anytime .
NATALIE: Anytime , day or night , I am excited to be handing out champagne .
DYLAN: He 's cute .
NATALIE: I 'm working .
DYLAN: Sixty-five percent of relationships egin in the workplace .
NATALIE: He 's a bartender . I need dependable . I need reliable . I need a Volvo man .
PETE: Sorry . He starts filling more flutes .
NATALIE: What are you reading ? He holds it up .
PETE: You know Michio Kazura ?
PETE: I know . I just moved back from Tokyo . It was the biggest thing since Haikiri Nomura .
NATALIE: Tomuru nasgawa ishi Tokyo sen !
PETE: Nagada quing-gong ni . Ni zeru .
DYLAN: Ask him out . Ask him out .
NATALIE: I 'm Natalie .
PETE: Pete . Good to meet you .
NATALIE: Listen , there 's an animation festival at the Egyptian this week . I was wondering if you might want to
PETE: Tomorrow night ? Eight o'clock ?
NATALIE: I 'll meet you there .
DYLAN: Pardon me .
NATALIE: I 'm on it . Spotting the Thin Man , she heads his way .
DYLAN: You call it .
NATALIE: You take point . I 'll circle behind .
DYLAN: Copy .
DYLAN: Excuse me ? He does n't turn back .
DYLAN: He 's going down . They take the stairs .
NATALIE: That way .
NATALIE: There are times I wish we carried guns .
DYLAN: Where 's the challenge in that ?
BOSLEY: Well . That was easy .
NATALIE: No , it was n't . She points to some code next to the numbers .
BOSLEY: In English ?
NATALIE: We need to tap this phone line at the source , THEN we 'll know where his calls were coming from .
DYLAN: 503 ? That 's not local , where is it ?
NATALIE: Bos , can we check a directory ?
ALEX: Do n't bother . I know where it is . I used to spend every winter there . As she says it
NATALIE: Hey look ! Mechanical bull .
DYLAN: Eyes on the prize , Nat . We got ta tap the phones .
ALEX: That looks like our target .
DYLAN: I think that can be arranged .
REDNECK: Hey baby , why do n't you ditch that stiff and come sit on ma lap ? Bosley tries to make himself small .
DYLAN: Ooh , that is an enticing offer . But I got a better idea . How about a shot contest ? My treat ? The three rednecks hoot and holler .
NATALIE: Mind if I try ?
DYLAN: Hey , I 've got an idea . Now let 's have a chair throwing contest .
REDNECK: Hunh ?
DYLAN: Chair throwing ? Never heard of it ? You just pick up your chai and throw it as far as you can .
THUG ONE: We expecting somebody ?
DYLAN: Guten Tag !
NATALIE: Guten Morgen !
DYLAN: Guten Nacht !
THUG TWO: They got the wrong address .
THUG ONE: Shut up .
ALEX: Where 's Knox ?
KNOX: Who are you ?
ALEX: The calvary . Giddy up .
ALEX: Sorry . Wrong room . Back ! Run !
BOSLEY: Alex , what 's your status ?
ALEX: Good news I found Knox .
DYLAN: This way . At this point , he 'll do whatever they say .
ALEX: They 're coming after us .
DYLAN: We were expecting that .
NATALIE: Okay , new problem .
BOSLEY: I do n't suppose giving up would e a No , it would n't . Then
DYLAN: Right !
NATALIE: There is no right .
DYLAN: There !
DYLAN: Where are we ? Suddenly , a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead .
ALEX: It 's a bobsled run . They 're facing backwards .
NATALIE: If it goes down the mountain , that 's all I need . Throwing it into reverse , Natalie peels out . The jeeps follow .
ALEX: Hard left ! HARD LEFT !
KNOX: Is this part of the plan ?
DYLAN: Yes . Except for the bobsled run , and the backwards part , it 's going exactly according to plan .
DYLAN: I think we 're in the clear .
NATALIE: Oh God , no .
DYLAN: What is it ?
NATALIE: I have a date with Pete . Right now .
DYLAN: Ouch .
ALEX: HARD RIGHT !
DYLAN: Call him , he 'll totally understand .
NATALIE: `` Gee , sorry Pete . I had to rescue a illionaire . ''
ALEX: Hard left ! She makes the left .
NATALIE: I 'll sound like a flake . I ca n't stand flakes .
DYLAN: He will so give you the second chance .
NATALIE: You think ?
DYLAN: Hello , I saw the way he looked at you .
ALEX: We 're at the bottom !
DYLAN: Well done .
KNOX: Thanks .
BOSLEY: I think that went very well . Charlie should send me on more missions .
ALEX: We could n't have done it without you , Bos .
DYLAN: Cocktail ?
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Good work , Angels . Not only did you save Knox , you saved his company as well .
DYLAN: I think that earns us a vacation .
NATALIE: Say , Fiji ?
ALEX: Any special guy you were thinking of inviting ? Natalie grins a guilty smile .
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Sorry , Angels . Our work is only half-done .
KNOX: First off , thank you . You rescued me , for which I am eternally grateful .
CHARLIE'S VOICE: That 's where you come in , Angels .
NATALIE: Sounds like a plan .
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Not as easy as that , Natalie . Red Star 's headquarters are as tightly guarded as a military facility . We 're going to need reconnaissance on their mainframe computer system , and the best way to get that is through Mr. Corwin himself .
ALEX: Consider it done .
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Dylan , I need you to arrange for Mr. Knox 's security . I 'd hate to have him kidnapped again .
DYLAN: Absolutely . But we 'd all feel safe if you could join us , Charlie .
CHARLIE: I 'd love to Angels . But I 'm in a it over my head at the moment .
DYLAN: We 're good .
KNOX: They 're bullet-proof . The last owner was paranoid .
DYLAN: Lucky for us .
KNOX: Which one of you ?
DYLAN: Whoever 's closest .
KNOX: I have a better idea .
DYLAN: What ?
KNOX: Stay for dinner . I 'm a pretty good cook .
DYLAN: I ca n't Mr. Knox . I 'm sorry . If you
KNOX: I 'm scared . Dylan is surprised by this .
DYLAN: Do n't be . She throws her coat back on the sofa .
KNOX: Thanks . It 's the only picture I have of me with my parents . They died a week later .
DYLAN: Oh . Oh , I 'm sorry . I had no idea
KNOX: Please , do n't apologize . I was too young to understand . I never knew how they died . When I was a kid , when I got shuffled from one foster home to another , I always thought they just disappeared .
DYLAN: But ?
KNOX: I only found out later , my father was in the military . He and my mother were killed while he was on assignment , somewhere in Eastern Europe . The files were classified , but I ead enough to know that he was a good man . Apparently , he was etrayed by one of his own team .
DYLAN: Wow . That 's a lot for a kid to live with .
KNOX: Yeah , but it motivated me , losing my family . It still does . I do n't take anything for granted . Dylan nods .
DYLAN: Boy did I have you pegged wrong .
KNOX: How do you mean ?
DYLAN: Well , to be honest , I thought you were a rich kid who inherited everything . But that 's pretty typical . I 've got instincts for the job , but when it comes to men ? Well
KNOX: I 'm glad you do n't see me as just a client .
DYLAN: Oh . Well , you ARE , so
KNOX: Is there someone you need to be going home to ?
DYLAN: No . But I
KNOX: Should n't you ? Dylan holds him back .
DYLAN: No . I should n't . She stands up .
CORWIN: What the ?
DYLAN: I 'm on it . Dylan steals away , heading for
THIN MAN: You okay , Boss ?
CORWIN: No thanks to you ! You 're supposed to be my head of security ! Who is that bitch ? !
THIN MAN: Do n't know . I 'll keep an eye out .
CORWIN: Yeah . You do that .
BOSLEY: Let 's make the switch .
KNOX: There !
CHARLIE'S VOICE: So if we want to find proof that Red Star stole Knox 's technology , that 's the computer to tap .
KNOX: Exactly . But they have heavy firewalls and encryption . You ca n't jack in from outside . You 'll have to physically be in that room to get at the data .
ALEX: Even if we do get inside , there wo n't e time to search for it . There 's got to be a hundred terabytes of information there . It could take days .
NATALIE: So you install a transmitter . All eyes go over to Natalie .
VIVIAN WU: That 's all fine in theory . But you still have to get inside that room to install it . What about security ?
ALEX: Red Star has a lot of Government contracts , so security is tight . Key- card badges throughout . Redundant security at all red-line areas with iometric scanners and weekly keycodes . Pervasive video surveillance , lasers , air-displacement sensors . Plus a hard- wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping .
VIVIAN WU: It sounds impossible .
DYLAN: It sounds like fun .
A VOICE: Tommy ? You gon na let me through or what ?
ALEX: It 's done . Red Star 's mainframe is open for business .
DYLAN: Champagne , please . Your best .
KNOX: Now I know why I hired you . You 're the best .
VIVIAN WU: I 'll have Systems get to work on this right away .
BOSLEY: Uh , actually Miss Wu , WE will get to work on this right away . Any evidence we find will be turned over to you AND the proper authorities .
VIVIAN WU: I do n't think you understand how important that data is , Mr
BOSLEY: Oh , indeed I do . And that 's why I 'll take very good care of it when I find it .
VIVIAN WU: But
KNOX: Vivian , please . Do as the man says .
DYLAN: Where you off to , Bos ?
BOSLEY: Vacation .
NATALIE: Uh oh , lem me guess . You 're off to chase bikinis at some tropical resort ?
BOSLEY: Exactly ! Fire Island , here I come !
KNOX: More champagne ?
NATALIE: Have to go . Plans tonight .
ALEX: Me too . As they get up
KNOX: And you ?
DYLAN: Um well
NATALIE: Hey Dylan , can we talk to you for a second ?
DYLAN: So what , so I like him . Is that so wrong ?
NATALIE: Uh , yeah Dylan , it IS . He 's a client .
DYLAN: WAS a client . We finished the job .
ALEX: She 's got a point .
NATALIE: What ? She does n't have ANY point , Alex , I ca n't believe you 're siding with her .
ALEX: I 'm not siding with anyone , but technically , he is no longer
NATALIE: You know Charlie would NEVER approve of this .
ALEX: Oh come on , Charlie would n't care . I think you 're just being overly cautious .
DYLAN: Uh , guys ? GUYS ! They turn to look at her .
VIVIAN WU: NO ! Not until I 've got the information I need . We 'll take him to the compound , hold him there . In the meantime , we 've got to tie up some loose ends .
THIN MAN: Whenever you say something like that , it means more work for me .
VIVIAN WU: The Angels will figure out they were duped . We ca n't afford them jeopardizing our plans .
JASON: Alex , I ca n't tell you how happy I am you came .
ALEX: Me too .
JASON: No , I mean , it 's weird . It 's weirding me out how happy I am when you 're around . Am I sick or something ?
ALEX: Got me .
JASON: The only bummer is , I start to jones when you 're not around . What the hell am I gon na do this weekend , if you 're not with me ?
ALEX: We 'll get you some sedatives . You 'll be fine .
JASON: Hey . Wait a second . Come with me !
ALEX: Come with you ?
JASON: Miami , on the Sony Jet . I 've got two tickets to the Final Four .
ALEX: Jason , I do n't
JASON: Wait , before you say no , let me just say something , okay ? I 'm sick of how little we see each other . I 'm sick of stealing a day here , or a week there .
ALEX: It 's my job , Jason . I ca n't explain it , but I have to be on call , all the time , and
JASON: What if I changed all that ?
ALEX: Gunfire ! Get down !
JASON: Fine . I 'm fine . They 're squibs , it 's fake . See ?
ALEX: Sorry about that , I
JASON: God , I loved that . The way you yelled and everything ? Baby , you een watching too many movies . Alright , I got ta go reset these . DO N'T GO ANYWHERE . I want to finish this conversation .
ALEX: Nice , Alex . Real nice .
JASON: Alex ? ALEX ?
NATALIE: Thanks for the second chance . I swear , I 'm really not a flake . He shrugs it off .
PETE: How can I deny any woman who 's seen all 23 `` Lords of Wind and Power '' ?
NATALIE: I bet there 's a dozen women here who fit that description . She 's right .
PETE: Honestly there 's a looks component as well .
NATALIE: Really .
PETE: You 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen this close up .
NATALIE: Ladies room . I 'll be back in two minutes .
PETE: I 'll be here .
NATALIE: Who do you work for ?
THE MAN: Jacket pocket .
THE MAN: I 've been following you . I did n't know which side you were on . This is bigger than you think .
NATALIE: I 'm so sorry , but I have to go . I ca n't explain . This is my cell phone number . Please call me tomorrow . Please . I 'm sorry .
DYLAN: Where 's that music coming from ?
KNOX: You 'll see . Just a little farther .
DYLAN: Oh Oh wow .
KNOX: Can I ask you a personal question ?
DYLAN: Maybe .
KNOX: How much do you know about Charlie ? Dylan seems surprised by this question .
DYLAN: Well , I do n't know what he looks like , ut I feel like I know him . We all do .
KNOX: And none of you have any clue who he actually is ?
DYLAN: Nope .
KNOX: And you 're never curious to find out ?
DYLAN: Of course , but believe me , it 's impossible . I 've tried . Let 's not talk about Charlie , okay ? Or work .
KNOX: Hmmm . I wonder what she 's here for ?
DYLAN: Want me to tell her to come back , or
KNOX: No , no . I 'd better deal . You go back to bed . Knox pulls on a robe , goes downstairs .
DYLAN: Hello ?
NATALIE: Dylan , we were set up . Vivian Wu is not who she says she is . She 's a forme assassin and an all around bitch .
DYLAN: Oh no . OH SHIT . Natalie , she 's HERE !
NATALIE: What ? !
DYLAN: I 'm at Knox 's , she just showed up !
NATALIE: I 'm ten minutes away . Wait until I get there .
DYLAN: I ca n't do that . Call Alex and meet me here .
NATALIE: Dylan
VIVIAN WU: I see you take your bodyguarding services seriously . Still , I worry that no one is watching the door .
DYLAN: Oh , I 'm watching it . In fact , I just called for back up . From her bag , Vivian pulls a silver 9MM .
VIVIAN WU: All the same , I 'm concerned about Mr. Knox 's safety .
KNOX: Vivian just came over to run through some numbers for the IPO .
VIVIAN WU: Please , take a seat . I 'm almost finished .
DYLAN: I 'm not much for games .
VIVIAN WU: Pity .
KNOX: Sorry Dylan . I knew this moment would come sooner or later . I was just hoping for later .
DYLAN: All this time , we thought Red Sta was behind this , but it was you . You faked your kidnapping . Knox taps his nose . She 's got it .
KNOX: To gain your trust . And get you help . I want you to know , my personal attraction to you was a sincere and unrelated complication .
DYLAN: Oh , well , in that case I feel a lot etter about you being a lying pole smoker .
KNOX: Why not ? You trust Charlie and you 've never even met him . Dylan crosses the sill , out onto the balcony .
VIVIAN WU: Oh , shut up .
KNOX: We 've got more important things to do .
DYLAN: I ca n't believe Knox tried to kill me . I mean , I 've been lied to , I 've been cheated on , but no guy has eve tried to SHOOT me before . I 'm gon na get him for that .
ALEX: He played us from the very start . It was all just so he could get us to tap into Red Star . He could n't figure out a way to do it himself .
NATALIE: Who knew that we are actually tapping into the main servers fo The National Security Agency ?
DYLAN: And now , thanks to us , he 's had hours to download whatever top secret information he wants , for God knows what reason .
NATALIE: Wait a minute . We installed the transmitter , yes , but we never gave him the receiver .
ALEX: What ?
NATALIE: That laptop was the only way to access the transmitter . And we gave the laptop to They look at each other
ANGELS: Bosley ! And on that note
ALEX: Come on , Bosley , answer . I 've tried all his numbers and paged him five times . No answer .
NATALIE: I do n't even want to think about what I 'm thinking right now .
DYLAN: Do n't ! He 's alive , he 's got ta be . If What IS that ?
BOSLEY: I know you ca n't answer , but I eally hope you can hear this .
DYLAN: Can we trace him ?
NATALIE: Not off a boosted signal . We 'd have to be within 20 miles .
ALEX: Come on , Bosley . Tell us where you are .
BOSLEY: I do n't know where I am , really . I 'm in a round room . The walls are white . Well . Not white-white . More of a cream , or an eggshell . Vanilla . Yes , I 'm going to say vanilla .
ALEX: Bingo .
BOSLEY: I do n't know which ocean . I was lindfolded the whole time . We were flying . It must 've been three o four hours . Maybe more .
DYLAN: He could be anywhere in North America .
BOSLEY: Wherever it is , they have really good pudding . Natalie holds up a finger stop .
DYLAN: What , pudding ?
NATALIE: Hear that ? That 's a blue spotted egret . They only live in one place .
ALEX: Florida . The MUSIC revs up , as we
KNOX: Well ?
THIN MAN: Our access was cut off at the source .
KNOX: GODDAMNIT !
THIN MAN: But not before we retrieved the information you wanted .
KNOX: Finally . How about Bosley ? Did we get the information we wanted ?
THIN MAN: Once we we drugged him , he sang like a bird . The Thin Man hands Knox another print-out .
KNOX: Hmmm . Miami Arena . Preparations have been made ?
THIN MAN: Yes . We move out tonight .
KNOX: Excellent . Where IS Bosley ?
THIN MAN: In the tower . We were waiting till you gave the word .
KNOX: Well ? No time like the present . The Thin Man nods .
HENCHMAN: Sir ? You should take a look at this . The Henchman leads Thin Man into
THIN MAN: It 's not moving . Oh , this is the oldest one in the ook . Punch up camera three .
DYLAN: Oh yeah ? And I suppose you could do better ?
THIN MAN: Yeah , I sure as hell could .
DYLAN: Oh , right .
THIN MAN: How about an underwater entry ? O hang gliding over the main tower ? There 's a million good ways in , if you just do your homework . Dylan glares at him , and as she does
ALEX: You heard the man .
NATALIE: Nice work , Dyl . They move into action .
THIN MAN: Present for you , sir .
KNOX: Dylan , how nice . Welcome to my Florida home . Not as tasteful as the one in LA , but much more private . She shrugs off the goons enough already .
DYLAN: So tell me , Knox , what 's the brilliant plan ? You gon na sell a list of ou foreign spies to the highest bidder ? Blackmail the President ?
KNOX: The first plan is too complicated , and the second is virtually impossible .
DYLAN: Revenge ? Against who ?
KNOX: You know what ? I 'm not in a gabby mood ight now . I 've got a score to settle .
DYLAN: Seems like you 're going a bit overboard .
KNOX: No , just leaving myself plenty of margin for error . Goodbye , Dylan . With that , he walks out of the room .
DYLAN: I do n't know why you bother . I 've already won .
THIN MAN: Is that so ?
DYLAN: Every moment I sit here is a moment I 'm using to figure out how to take you down . In fact , this statement this one I 'm making ight here is just me stalling for time while I decide which of your goons I 'm going to flatten first . It 's gon na be the guy behind me .
DYLAN: By the time your guys are firing , I 'll be at about 180 on my reverse inverted 360 , which will land me on Fat Boy there , as promised . He 'll take the chair seat in the chin . Now I 'm warning both of you I 'm going to get you to shoot each other . I know . Cliche as that sounds . Last , you guys hell , I 'll make something up . We 'll have fun . The Thin Man smirks oh-so-confidently .
NATALIE: Bosley 's close .
ALEX: You find him . I 'll get Dylan . Natalie heads left . Alex goes right .
NATALIE: BOSLEY ! Bosley , can you hear me ?
BOSLEY: Natalie ! Is that you ?
NATALIE: How do I get up to you ?
BOSLEY: There 's a staircase . Look for a switch .
NATALIE: Hello ? Pete , hi ! How are you ?
PETE: I 'm good . I just you said you wanted me to call .
NATALIE: I did . I do . I mean , thank you for calling .
PETE: I 'm not an insecure person or anything , and I 've really enjoyed the very brief time we have spent together .
NATALIE: Can you hold on a sec ?
PETE: Listen , is this a bad time ?
NATALIE: No . Not at all . She starts searching again for the switch .
PETE: You just sound distracted .
NATALIE: You know , work this week has been eally busy . It 's been hard to focus .
PETE: Natalie , what was that ?
NATALIE: Everything 's fine !
VIVIAN WU: Hate to disagree .
PETE: No , it 's Pete .
NATALIE: You bitch ! I like that guy . Mocking , Vivian wipes away a tear .
VIVIAN WU: To be honest ?
NATALIE: I can handle villainy . I can even handle super-villainy . But what you did is just wrong .
DYLAN: Here we go .
BOSLEY: Oh my God , let me help you .
KNOX: Let 's GO ! The helicopter quick ascends , just as
NATALIE: Do n't worry , we 'll get him .
DYLAN: You do n't understand . He 's got a pound of C-5 in that briefcase .
ALEX: The question is , where 's he headed ?
DYLAN: Not that I do n't believe you , but how exactly do you know all this ?
BOSLEY: Because Angels , I was the one who purchased those tickets .
NATALIE: But Bosley , you HATE sports , why would you You did n't buy them for yourself .
ALEX: You bought them for
ANGELS: CHARLIE !
DYLAN: What do you think he looks like ?
ALEX: Sixty , tall , well-built .
NATALIE: I always saw him as younger .
DYLAN: Definitely . With black hair .
NATALIE: No , silver hair . And tan .
ALEX: He 's not George Hamilton .
NATALIE: He 's outside a lot .
DYLAN: We 'll know him when we see him , that 's for sure .
ALEX: IF we see him .
NATALIE: How hard can it be to spot Charlie ? They slam into the doors , and we
DYLAN: Aw , shit .
ALEX: I 'll take the luxury boxes .
DYLAN: I 'll take the mezzanine .
NATALIE: I got the floor .
JASON: Yes , yes !
ALEX: Charlie ! ? Charles Townsend ! Jason whips around and locks eyes with Alex .
JASON: Alex ?
ALEX: Jason ? Shit .
JASON: ALEX ! Hey
DYLAN: Charlie ! Charlie !
NATALIE: Charlie ?
LIKELY CANDIDATE: Who ?
ALEX: Charles Townsend ? Anybody , Charles Townsend ? She ducks back into the hallway .
ALEX: Jason , hi , I
JASON: No you can talk to me NOW . I want to know what the hell is going on . First , you disappear with no explanation , not even a goodbye .
ALEX: I 'm sorry , I
JASON: Now , I see you here , but you 're with some other guy .
THIN MAN: Hey , movie star , do yourself a favor and get lost .
JASON: Lem me guess . You must be Charlie ?
ALEX: Jason , please
JASON: No , no I 'm sick of this shit . I 'm sick of this asshole telling you what you can and ca n't do .
THIN MAN: That was stupid .
ALEX: Jason , get down !
JASON: What the hell is going on ?
ALEX: Right now , just by leaning forward , I could crush your windpipe . You 'd die a slow and painful death . You do n't want that , do you ?
ALEX: Hi , Jason . Gim me one second ? Jason nods , sure .
JASON: Yeah , I can see that .
ALEX: And that was n't Charlie .
JASON: Right .
ALEX: I 'm actually here to stop a madman from killing everyone in this uilding . Would it be okay if we talked later ?
JASON: Go save the world , honey . I 'll be waiting for you . Alex smiles . Runs off .
REFEREE: Time out !
DYLAN: Alright , Dylan , all we have to do is figure out which wire to cut .
ALEX: You 're kidding me .
DYLAN: Chartreuse and magenta . This has got ta be it .
KNOX: Who told you that , my idiotic henchman ? Do you think I tell him ANYTHING that 's confidential ?
DYLAN: Yeah , I fall for assholes , and you ARE one . Knox laughs .
KNOX: Good one . Well , I must be going . If you like your body parts attached to you torso , I suggest you do the same .
ALEX: Give it up , Knox . You 're surrounded .
NATALIE: Give us the detonator .
KNOX: NO !
ANGELS: Charlie ?
CHARLIE: Your father was a double agent , Eric . Yes , I revealed him , but he was killed y his own people before we could throw him in jail . He was my friend .
KNOX: It 's still your fault , you arrogant prick ! You still killed my father !
CHARLIE: Maybe . Maybe I did . But why should YOU kill all these people ? If you hate me so much , just shoot ME . Just shoot me , Eric .
KNOX: Okay . You 're right . I 'll just kill you .
DYLAN: Charlie , no . NO !
VOICE: Ucch , that tasted terrible !
NATALIE: Bosley ! Are you okay ?
BOSLEY: Think so .
DYLAN: Hey , wait a second . If Bosley 's here then where 's Charlie ?
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Great work , angels . You 'll be happy to know you received anothe presidential commendation . The Angels , and Bosley , clink glasses .
THE ANGELS: Thank you Charlie .
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Alex , Natalie I know you 've been putting in some long hours on this case , so I thought you might enjoy a chance to catch up with some old friends .
DYLAN: Any chance you 'll be joining us , Charlie ?
CHARLIE: I 'd love to , Angels . But I have some precious treasures to watch over .
DYLAN: To Charlie .
BANKY: Felt Like this fucking day would neve come . Issue two - on the shelf .
HOLDEN: Yippee .
BANKY: Do n't start , alright ! This is a cool moment , and I 'd appreciate you not trying to ruin it . How often does a guy get the opportunity to purchase something with his name on it ! Banky Edwards- right ! Holden McNeil .
HOLDEN: I know my name .
BANKY: C'mon , sour puss . We got the rest of our lives to be artists . But it 's supply and demand . And right now , the unwashed masses demand this .
HOLDEN: This is easy , alright ! And right now it pays the bills . Just do n't forget that we 're better than this .
BANKY: I 'll tell you who we 're better than these two fags right here .
WALT: I 'm not that in need of fifteen cents ight now .
BANKY: You guys operate the smallest , ladies ' idge circle I 've ever seen .
WALT: For your information , we 're playing Crimson Mystical Mages ' - an overpower card game . Not that eithe of you would give a shit about something as advanced as this - there are no dick or poopie jokes involved .
BANKY: I do n't think they 're fans .
WALT: No , we 're not . You 're both a couple of fucking no talents that got lucky .
FAN: Could you sign it To a really big fan !
HOLDEN: You bet .
FAN: I love this book man ! This shit 's awesome . I wish I was like these guys - getting stoned , talking all raw about chicks and fighting supervillains ! I love these guys ! They 're like Cheech and Chong ' meet Bill and fed ' !
HOLDEN: I like to chink of them as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ' meet Vladimir and Estragon ' .
FAN: Yeah ! Who ! BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR .
COLLECTOR: So you draw this !
BANKY: I ink it and I 'm also the colorist . The guy next to me draws it . But we oth came up with the characters ,
COLLECTOR: What 's that mean - you ink it ' !
BANKY: Well . It means that Holden draws the pictures in pencil , and then he gives it to me to go over in ink
COLLECTOR: So you just trace !
BANKY: It 's not tracing . I add depth and shading to give the image mere definition . Only then does the drawing eally take shape .
COLLECTOR: You go over what he draws with a pen - that 's tracing .
BANKY: Not really . Next !
COLLECTOR: Hey man . If somebody draws something and then you draw the same thing right on top of it , not going out-side the designated original art what do call that !
LITTLE KID: I do n't know . Tracing ?
COLLECTOR: See ?
BANKY: It 's not tracing .
COLLECTOR: Oh , but it is .
BANKY: Do you want Lour book signed or what ?
COLLECTOR: Hey - do n't get all testy with him just because you have a problem with your station in life .
BANKY: I 'm secure with what I do .
COLLECTOR: Then say it - you 're a tracer .
BANKY: How should I sign this ?
LITTLE KID: I do n't want you to sign it , I want the guy that draws Bluntman and Chronic to sign it . You 're just a tracer .
COLLECTOR: Tell him , Little Shaver . Holden accepts a comic from another Fan .
HOLDEN: Who do I sign it to !
COLLECTOR: Jesus ! All I did was call him a tracer !
HOLDEN: Could you get him out of here ! The Security Guards drag the collector away .
COLLECTOR: Hey , wait a sec ! He jumped me ! And you 're dragging me away ! ! Fucking tracer !
HOLDEN: Can I explain the audience principle to you ! If you insult and accost them , then we have no audience .
BANKY: He started it ! Fucking cock-knocker ! He 's lucky I did n't put my pen through his thorax !
HOLDEN: Need I remind you Curtain 's in ten minutes .
HOOPER: For years in this industry whenever an African-American character - hero o villain - was introduced usually by white artists and writers - they got slapped with racist names that singled them out as negroes Black Panther , Black Lightning , Black Goliath , Black Mantra , Black Talon , Black Spider , Black Hand , Black Falcon , Black Cat..
HOLDEN: Bullshit ! Lando Calrissian was a lack man , and he got to fly the Millennium Falcon !
HOOPER: Who said that ? ! ?
HOLDEN: I did ! Lando Calrissian is a positive lack role model in the realm of Science Fiction/Fantasy .
HOOPER: Fuck Lando Calrissian ! Uncle Tom nigger ! Always some white boy got ta invoke the holy trilogy ' ! Bust this - those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down - even in a galaxy far , far away . Check this shit . You got cracker farm-boy Luke Skywalker , Nazi poster boy - lond hair , blue eyes . And then you 've got Darth Vader the blackest brother in the galaxy . Nubian God .
BANKY: What 's a Nubian ?
HOOPER: Shut the fuck up ! Now Vader , he 's a spiritual brother , with the force and all that shit . Then this cracke Skywalker gets his hands on a light- saber , and the boy decides he 's gon na run the fucking universe - gets a whole Klan of whites together , and they 're gon na bust up Vader 's hood the Death Star . Now what the fuck do you call that !
BANKY: Intergalactic Civil War !
HOOPER: Gentrification . They 're gon na drive our the black element , to make the galaxy quote , unquote safe ' for white folks .
HOLDEN: But Vader turns , out to be Luke 's father . And in Jedi , they become friends .
HOOPER: Do n't make me bust a cap in your ass , yo ! Jedi 's the most insulting installment , because Vader 's eautiful , black visage is sullied when he pulls off his mask to eveal a feeble , crusty white man ! They 're trying to tell us that deep inside , we all want to be white !
BANKY: Well is n't that true !
HOOPER: BLACK RAGE ! BLACK RAGE ! ! I 'LL KILL ANY WHITE FOLKS I LAY MY MOTHER FUCKIN ' EYES ON ! ! !
BANKY: Well what about you ! You did n't tell me you were going to scream Black Rage ' . I nearly pissed myself .
HOLDEN: How do you manage to get away with this all the time ? Should n't cops be usting your head open right about now ?
BANKY: Wrong coast .
HOOPER: Well this right here - she full of lanks , okay . And Opiate gets all sorts of legal clearances before I go on .
HOLDEN: Your publisher condones these theatrics !
HOOPER: Condones ? Honey , they insist . I need to sell the image to sell the book Would the audience still buy the Black Rage ' angle if they found out the book was written by a.. a
BANKY: Faggot .
HOOPER: When you say if it sounds so sexy
BANKY: Hey , hey ! I 'll play your victim , but not your catcher .
VOICE: How is it that you sound like Ministe Farakhan when you 're on stage.. They turn to see
ALYSSA: and the King of Pop when you 're nor .
HOOPER: Look out , boys - this kitten has a whip .
ALYSSA: Always before I get to speak ! I swea - the next con I attend and they ask me to be on the minority panel , if I see your name anywhere near the List , I 'm passing .
HOOPER: Holden . Banky - this pile of P.M.S . is Alyssa Jones . She does that book Idiosyncratic Routine ' . This is the fourth panel we 've been on together , and even though she knows my publishe sets this up and pays for the event . She still gets mad when it ends with my act .
ALYSSA: I just wish I was the one who gets to shoot you .
HOOPER: That 's what my father said when I came - nay - leapt out of the closet These boys do Bluntman and Chronic ' , which outsells both of our books put together , hence they 're never on a panel with the likes of us . They slumming right now .
BANKY: I 've read your book . It 's cute . Chick stuff , but cute . Holden hits him .
HOLDEN: Sorry about him . He 's dealing with eing an inker .
ALYSSA: Oh . You trace ! Banky seethes .
HOLDEN: I really enjoy your book I 'm surprised we 've never met at any other Con 's efore .
ALYSSA: Lose the dick or change your skin tone and we can get to know each other on panel after panel while the Pink Black Panther here plays Chuck D. for the fanboys .
HOOPER: Hey , jealousy . I told Alyssa I 'd buy her a post-rave drink . Do the Garden-Staters have to sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel , or can you stay for a round in the big , scary city !
BANKY: We 're gon na take off soon
HOLDEN: We 'll go .
BANKY: We 'll go .
HOOPER: Archie and Jughead were lovers .
BANKY: Shut the fuck up .
HOOPER: It 's true . Archie was the bitch and Jughead was the butch - that 's why Jughead wears that crown-looking hat all the time he the king , of queen Archie 's world .
BANKY: Man , I feel a hate-crime coming on
HOLDEN: He 's got a point . Archie never did settle on Betty or Veronica .
BANKY: Because he wanted them both at the same time , you assholes ! He neve chose one because he was trying to get oth of them into a three-way !
HOOPER: Here . I want you to go down to the corner store and buy yourself a clue . Go on .
BANKY: Eat it . Urkel .
HOOPER: I told you to watch it with that Urkel shit . Face it , girl - Archie 's a sister .
BANKY: That 's it . You .
HOOPER: Moi ?
BANKY: You are marching back across the street with me , and we 're going to pick up a shit load of Archie books , I am going to prove to you - beyond the shadow of a doubt that Archie was all about pussy . Come on .
HOOPER: This boy is conflicted , I shall play mother-therapist for him . You two sit tight . We shall return promptly .
ALYSSA: Is he always Like that !
HOLDEN: For years now . Started back in third grade - a nun was teaching us about the Blessed Trinity . She 's going on about the three persons in one God thing - Father , Son , Holy Spirit - and he just goes ballistic . I guess it was too big for him to grasp . They got into this huge fight .
ALYSSA: Please . How bad could it have been !
HOLDEN: You ever seen a nun call a small child a fucking cunt-rag ' ? Was n't pretty , Shit like that 's bound to happen when you make a kid wear a matching tie and slacks everyday .
ALYSSA: And your parochial school misadventures !
HOLDEN: Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass . Turned me into a grade school alcoholic altar boy . I could n't tell you how many mornings after serous enders I 'd wake up next to strange priests .
ALYSSA: Are n't you the sharp wit !
HOLDEN: Sharp ! No . I 'm just a fan of clergy- molestation humor . Probably why the extended family quit inviting me to First Communion parties . Alyssa laughs . Holden smiles .
ALYSSA: You play darts !
HOLDEN: Not professionally . You know - only in bars .
ALYSSA: So your new book seems to be selling like mad .
HOLDEN: It goes back to something my grandmother told me when I was a kid . `` Holden , '' she said `` The big bucks are in dick and fart jokes . '' She was a church-goer .
ALYSSA: Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a eal artist trapped in commercial hell - pitying his good fortune . I 'm sure you can dry your eyes on all those fat checks you rake in .
HOLDEN: I 'm sorry - did I detect a note of itter envy in there !
ALYSSA: Nope . I 'm happy my stuff gets read at all . There 's very little market fo hearts and flowers in this spandex- clad , big pecs , big tits , big guns field . If I sell two issues , I feel like John Grisham .
HOLDEN: It 's all about marketing . Over- o underweight guys who do n't get laid - they 're our bread and butter . People like those two outside should be yours .
ALYSSA: Bubbly guy like that , it 's hard to figure out why .
HOLDEN: You 've got ta respect that kind of display of affection . It 's crazy , ude , self-absorbed - but it 's love .
ALYSSA: That 's not love .
HOLDEN: Says you .
ALYSSA: That out there ! That 's fleeting .
HOLDEN: Fleeting .
ALYSSA: Uh-huh . You wan na hear about love ! Oh , I 'll tell you about love .
HOLDEN: A story ?
ALYSSA: The story . The original love story .
HOLDEN: 'Doctor Zhivago ' .
ALYSSA: Nope . My mother 's uncle . He was a millionaire .
HOLDEN: Get out .
ALYSSA: I kid you not .
HOLDEN: Explain .
ALYSSA: All through high school , he dated this one girl . They were inseparable . And when they graduated , she went off to Carnegie Mellon
HOLDEN: In Pittsburgh .
ALYSSA: I 'm impressed . So he stays in the home town , and they begin their long- distance relationship . The plan is , on the third Sunday of every month , he 'll train out , spend a week then train back They do this for fou years .
HOLDEN: That is love .
ALYSSA: Not nearly finished . Two months efore she 's going to graduate , he 's got this job digging graves , and he comes across
HOLDEN: A stiff .
ALYSSA: A steamer trunk containing silve ingots .
HOLDEN: Get out of here .
ALYSSA: Many , many silver ingots . Now , my mother 's uncle being quite the ingenious chap - he buries the trunk again and heads up to the main office , where he proceeds to purchase a cemetery plot . Guess which one ?
HOLDEN: Clever .
ALYSSA: So now he owns the plot and all of its contents . Two days later , my mother 's uncle is worth three million .
HOLDEN: At which time he marries the high school sweetheart and lives happily ever after .
ALYSSA: Not even close . Inside the steame trunk , stenciled into the wood , o something like that , is a curse .
HOLDEN: Someone wrote 'Fuck ' inside his new steamer trunk .
ALYSSA: Not that kind of curse . A cryptic curse `` Great fortune means great loss '' it said .
HOLDEN: What kind of asshole writes that inside a steamer trunk !
ALYSSA: The same kind of asshole that buries silver ingots . The day my mother 's uncle is heading out to see the girl , he stops at his accountant 's to gra some cash , and winds up missing his train . So he has to take the next one - which he does - and he gets there an hour later than his usual time of arrival , whereupon he sees lights .
HOLDEN: A hero 's welcome for the new millionaire .
ALYSSA: It seems that while she was standing on the platform waiting that extra hour for my mother 's uncle to show up , the girl was dragged into the bushes y an unknown assailant , raped and gutted . Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink .
HOLDEN: That 's a love story ! !
ALYSSA: Yes , and here 's why my mother 's uncle ode that train every day for the rest of his life . One day up , the next day ack . Did that 'till the day he died . He donated the fortune he 'd acquired to the train station in Pittsburgh , to have a well-lit terminal built . The train line let him ride for free after that .
HOLDEN: I should hope so . Jesus , that 's the saddest tale I 've ever heard .
ALYSSA: That 's my love story .
HOLDEN: Those two are n't on the hood of Banky 's car anymore .
ALYSSA: I told you It was n't love . I got ta split . It was really nice meeting you . I wish you the best of luck with your book . Tell Hooper I 'll call him later . And tell your friend to calm down .
BANKY: You 're insane . Archie is not fucking Mister Weatherbee !
HOOPER: Deny , deny , deny . Where 's Alyssa ?
HOLDEN: Huh ! Oh . She left . She said she 'd call you later .
BANKY: He 's just offering to help Archie with his homework !
HOOPER: Read between the lines .
BANKY: Fuck this . Let 's go . Traffic . Holden !
HOLDEN: What !
BANKY: Let 's go .
HOOPER: D'jou see that dent in the hood of your car !
BANKY: What the ! Son of a bitch ! Banky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper .
HOOPER: Let me guess you like her !
HOLDEN: Who ?
HOOPER: Miss Alyssa Jones .
HOLDEN: She 's alright .
HOOPER: As long as that 's all . Maybe you can convince that partner of your 's to drop me off downtown before you scurry out the tunnel !
HOLDEN: Mister Weatherbee was n't really trying to fuck Archie , was he ! They begin exiting .
HOOPER: Hell no . Weatherbee was Reggie 's itch .
BANKY: This is one of the best street lights you 've ever drawn .
HOLDEN: It 's the one across from the post office .
BANKY: Looks just like it .
HOLDEN: Thanks . What do you wan na do tonight !
BANKY: Get a pizza . Watch 'Degrassi Junio High ' .
HOLDEN: You got a weird thing for Canadian melodrama .
BANKY: I 've got a weird thing for girls who say 'aboot ' .
HOLDEN: Bank-Hold-Up .
HOOPER: Hooper here . Listen , I know how you urb-fiends hate the city , but there 's a club shindig going down that I think you 'd get into .
HOLDEN: Where is it ?
HOOPER: Place called Her-sterectomy - I 'm tempting as bar-keep .
HOLDEN: I do n't know , Hoop . We 're prepping the next issue , and we 've got our big M-TV meeting in the morning .
HOOPER: I told her you would n't be interested .
HOLDEN: Told who ?
HOOPER: Alyssa .
HOLDEN: Alyssa from last night Alyssa ?
HOOPER: How do you begin and end a question with the same word like that ? You got skill . Yes , that one . She asked me to invite you . Now here 's the part where you say
HOLDEN: I 'll be there .
HOOPER: Thought so . Ten o'clock . Later .
BANKY: Who was that ?
HOLDEN: Hooper . He invited me to a club .
BANKY: When 's that faggot going to learn - you like chicks .
HOLDEN: Not that kind of a club .
BANKY: So when we leaving ?
HOLDEN: 'We ' ? You ca n't go . He 's setting me up with Alyssa .
BANKY: And ?
HOLDEN: And I do n't want you messing it up .
BANKY: Like I care about your shit . Maybe I 'll hook up myself .
HOLDEN: I just told you - it 's not that kind of club .
BANKY: How does one man get to be so funny !
HOLDEN: How are you going to get home if I hook up !
BANKY: Like that 'll happen .
HOLDEN: Let me explain something to you , my witless chum the other night in that ar , we two - Alyssa and I shared a moment , alright !
BANKY: Oh , you had a moment !
HOLDEN: We shared a moment . And in that moment , one thing was made abundantly clear this girl loves me , my friend . Loves-me .
GUY: This is so watered down . It 's terrible . Why is it you can never get a decent drink in these places !
HOOPER: Trying to find you a tissue .
BANKY: Alright - bring on the free hootch .
HOOPER: As long as you do n't bitch about how little alcohol is in the drink . You owe me five sixty .
GUY: And I suppose you 're going to make your friend here pay for his drink ight !
BANKY: Hey , I befriended a guy in a position of authority so I could abuse that authority and get free shit . You want to do the same ? There 's a lonely Hindu works at the ' 7-ll ' across the street . Get in tight with him .
GUY: I work at that ' 7-11 ' !
BANKY: Wan na be friends !
HOOPER: Where 's your better half !
BANKY: Taking a piss . Guy 's got a bladde like an infant .
HOOPER: That 's funny - he says you 're hung like an infant .
BANKY: Must his mother tell him everything ! Holden enters .
HOLDEN: Where is she ?
HOOPER: Over there
OC HOOPER: Been dancin ' for an hour . Has n't stopped yet . Hooper , Holden , and Banky stare OC .
BANKY: She ai n't no Denny Terrio , I 'll say that . Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit .
HOOPER: Wait . wait , wait - there 's something you should know .
HOLDEN: She 's got a boyfriend .
HOOPER: Well.. no .
HOLDEN: Then what 's to know ?
BANKY: There 're a lot of chicks in this place .
HOOPER: 'Chicks ' . You 're such a man .
BANKY: He did n't really say that about my dick , did he !
HOLDEN: Hey , hey , hey - you fucked up my cabbage-patch !
ALYSSA: Well , well , well - Bluntman himself . Or should I call you Chronic !
HOLDEN: Call me flattered . I heard you sent me the invite to this little soiree ' .
ALYSSA: From a former home-town girl , to Mister Home-Town himself .
HOLDEN: You 're saying you 're from the 'burbs !
ALYSSA: Middletown , N.J .
HOLDEN: Get out of here ! I 'm from Highlands !
ALYSSA: I know . Hooper told me .
HOLDEN: How is it that we never ran into one another ?
ALYSSA: You graduate from Hudson ?
HOLDEN: Yeah . Eighty eight .
ALYSSA: I went to North . Also eighty eight .
HOLDEN: What a small fucking world . So you know the tri-town area !
ALYSSA: Quiz me .
HOLDEN: Miller Hill ?
ALYSSA: I wrote my name on the wall .
HOLDEN: Sandy Hook ?
ALYSSA: Lost my virginity there .
HOLDEN: This is so cool . The mall !
ALYSSA: Eden Prairie of Menlo Park !
HOLDEN: Wait - here 's the big test Quick Stop !
ALYSSA: My best friend fucked a dead guy in the back room .
HOLDEN: You know that girl ! !
ALYSSA: I did . Before she was committed .
HOLDEN: You know what this is ! This is fate .
ALYSSA: No , this is the 'Rog ' .
HOLDEN: I was talking about us meeting - what are the chances !
ALYSSA: Pretty slim . I have n't been back to the 'burbs since my friend 's funeral .
HOLDEN: The Quick Stop girl died !
ALYSSA: Another friend - Julie Dwyer . She died in the..
HOLDEN: Y.M.C.A pool ! Damn ! You knew he too !
ALYSSA: So well .
HOLDEN: One friend in an asylum , the othe friend in the grave . You 're a dangerous person to know .
ALYSSA: But I can tap . That was the Buffalo Two-Step .
HOLDEN: Very solid .
ALYSSA: That 's what six years of tap lessons yields .
HOLDEN: Two towns away from each other fo years and we had to meet in New York . The Sand stops playing . People clap .
ALYSSA: Coulda been worse - we could have not met at all . Holden looks at her .
OC SINGER: Thank you . Thanks .
SINGER: A long time ago , we used to have this ass player who took off one day to draw funny books or something . Maybe you 've seen her stuff - it 's called 'Idiosyncratic Routine ''
BANKY: This is so queer .
HOOPER: You do n't know the half of it .
ALYSSA: She is such a twat .
BANKY: Now that , my friend , is a.. shared moment Holden continues to stare - mouth agape . Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss .
HOLDEN: That 's rude .
BANKY: Man , when are we ever going to get a chance to see this kind of shit live without paying for it ? Alyssa and the Girl break their kiss .
ALYSSA: Uh-oh - better knock it off we 're getting a man excited .
HOLDEN: Sorry . It 's just new to him .
BANKY: Oh , and you 're an old hand at this .
ALYSSA: No , I should apologize . I do n't usually get all mushy in public . But it 's been awhile since I 've seen Kim here .
KIM: Tell me you did n't set that gross display up with the band just so you could nail me .
ALYSSA: Like I 'd have to go through that much effort
KIM: You know what ! I want to dance .
ALYSSA: Go ahead . I 'll watch from here .
KIM: No . I want to dance with you .
ALYSSA: Do n't be such a rag . I have to sit here and work up the desire to fuck you later .
KIM: Please .
ALYSSA: Yes ?
BANKY: You said 'fuck ' . To that girl . You said you 'd 'fuck ' her .
ALYSSA: And ?
BANKY: How can a girl 'fuck ' another girl ! Were you talking about strap-ons o something ?
HOLDEN: Would you shut up ! !
BANKY: What ! ! ? It 's a valid question . You know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse Letters section is written by guys - this is our chance to get the inside scoop .
HOLDEN: I do n't know how many times I can apologize for him .
ALYSSA: It 's okay . Secretly , all I really want is to be the center of attention . I 've never used a snap-on .
BANKY: Then what 's with saying 'fuck ? Should n't you say 'eat her out ' or at least modify the term 'fuck ' with something like 'fist ' ?
ALYSSA: Let me ask you a question - can men 'fuck ' each other !
BANKY: Ask Hooper .
ALYSSA: In your estimation .
BANKY: Sure .
ALYSSA: So for you , to 'fuck ' means to penetrate . You 're used to the more traditional definition - you inside some girl you 've duped , jack-hammering away , not noticing that bored look in her eyes .
BANKY: Hey - I always notice the bored look in their eyes .
ALYSSA: 'Fucking ' is nor limited to penetration , Banky . For me it describes any sex when it 's not totally about love . I do n't love Kim , ut I 'll fuck her . I 'm sure you do n't love every girl you sleep with .
BANKY: Some of them I downright loathe .
ALYSSA: But I 'll bet it 's different with the ones you love . I 'll bet you go the full nine when it 's not just a quick fix - like you go down on them longe or something .
HOLDEN: Here we go .
BANKY: I do n't do that .
ALYSSA: What ? ! ? !
BANKY: I stopped dropping . It got to be too frustrating .
HOLDEN: As stupid as you usually come off during this diatribe of your 's , you 're going to come off ten times as stupid on this occasion .
BANKY: What ? ! I lost my tolerance for the ullshit baggage that comes with eating girls out . What 's the big deal ? !
ALYSSA: If you say the smell , so help me , I 'll slug you .
BANKY: Not the smell - the smell is good . I 'm talking about not being able to do it property . And my mother brought me up to believe that if I ca n't do something ight I should n't do it at all . Of course , my father told me she gave lousy head , but that 's beside the point .
ALYSSA: At least you blame yourself for you sexual inadequacies .
BANKY: No , I blame them . Chicks never help you out . They never tell you what to do . And most of them are self- conscious about that smell factor , and so most of the time they just lay there , frozen like a deer in the headlights , right ? Not for nothing , ut when a chick goes down on me . I let her know where to go , and what the status is . You got ta handle it like CNN and the Weather Channel - constant updates .
HOLDEN: You 're such an idiot .
ALYSSA: No , he 's got a point . That 's how I was in high school - I was nervous , and inhibited about being eaten out . But by the time I got to college , that all changed . I loosened up . Not only did I learn to communicate - I learned to be bossy . I was like one of those guys at the airport with those big flash lights - waving them this way , directing them that way , telling them when to stop .
BANKY: And that 's all I 'm saying , it 'd be different if chicks helped out - pointed a guy in the right direction . Then there 'd be no bullshit , no wasted time , and no chance for permanent injuries .
ALYSSA: Permanent injuries ?
BANKY: Sure . You wan na see something permanent ! I got this from Nina Rollins , sophomore year . I 'm going down on her , and out of nowhere , her cat jumps on her stomach . She does this big ol ' pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in half , sends it down my throat . I had to get a crown for the stub .
ALYSSA: I got that beat . I got that beat . Sophomore year . I 'm going down on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room afte we went club-hopping . I 'm totally drunk , and in the middle of it , I fall asleep - right there in her lap . She got so mad , she digs her heel into my ack , right there . That 's permanent .
BANKY: You see this ! That 's the farthest I can move my neck to the right Sophomore year , I 'm going out with Maria Bennert , and for six months , I 'm going down on her , and not a damn thing 's happening . Then one night , I change a position , or vary my lapping-speed , and suddenly it 's a whole new world . She 's moving around , convulsing , breathing heavy . And her legs are pressing against my ears so tightly that I do n't hear he father come into the room . He grabs my hair and he pulls me way back , hard .
ALYSSA: Senior year . Spring Formal . I 'm eating our Missy Kurt in her brother 's car . She 's laying across the back seat , and I 'm half-hanging out of the car , my knees on the ground . She 's flailing around , and she knocks the parking brake off . The car starts olling down the hill , and my right knee is cut up all to shit like a kiddy 's scissor class cut it up fo paper dolls .
HOLDEN: Holy shit , is that the time . We 've got ta beat traffic .
BANKY: What traffic - it 's one thirty in the morning !
HOLDEN: And rush hour starts in six hours . Let 's go . Thanks for inviting us out . It was educational .
BANKY: Since you like chicks , right.. do you just look at yourself in the mirror all the time ?
HOLDEN: Lower your voice .
BANKY: What 'd I tell you - she just needs the ight guy . All every woman really wants - be it mother , senator , nun - is some serious deep-dicking .
HOLDEN: I 'm sure the gay community appreciates your support . JOHN SLOSS , the boy 's lawyer , joins them .
SLOSS: Please tell me you have n't blown this deal already .
BANKY: Sloss like a mother fucker .
SLOSS: Hey , every mother but your 's - a shyster 's got ta have his standards . Shall we ?
EXEC 1: We just want to start off by saying that it 's a pleasure to finally meet you . While it 's been - shall we say - an experience dealing with Sloss here , one of the main reasons we started this whole thing was to meet the guys that do 'Bluntman and Chronic ' .
EXEC 2: 'Snootchie Bootchies ' .
EXEC 1: Which brings us to our proposal we are extremely interested in doing twelve , half-hour 'Bluntman and Chronic ' cartoons . The age of Beavis is coming to a close , and we 're looking for something something
BANKY: Even more retarded and juvenile to sate the voracious , intellectually- challenged miscreants that make up your key demographic .
EXEC 1: So what do you say ! Are we in usiness !
SLOSS: Jim , Sean - could we have a few minutes !
EXEC 2: Uh absolutely . We 'll just..
EXEC 1: Uhwait outside
SLOSS: So ? Did I do good ?
BANKY: You did better - you sold us out !
SLOSS: Do you know how much you 'll make on merchandising alone !
BANKY: Money and Power , and Money and Power
SLOSS: Money dnd Power , and Money and
HOLDEN: I do n't think it 's a good idea .
BANKY: What 's not a good idea ! Please do n't say the cartoon , please do n't say the cartoon
HOLDEN: The cartoon .
SLOSS: What ? ! ? Are you out of your fucking mind !
BANKY: John , let me handle this . You are out of your fucking mind , are n't you !
HOLDEN: Is this how you want to be remembered ! As the guy who created Bluntman and Chronic !
BANKY: No , I 'd like to be remembered as the filthy rich guy who created Bluntman and Chronic .
HOLDEN: But it 'll be all glossy and main- stream . We 'll lose any artistic credibility we ever had .
SLOSS: Is it me ! I do n't see the problem .
BANKY: He just has to get over this crush of his .
SLOSS: Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again ! Holden - she 's not really a Princess .
BANKY: Not on her ; on Alyssa Jones - the chick that does that comic book 'Idiosyncratic Routine ' . You eve seen it ?
SLOSS: Please . Like I even read your comic , let alone anyone else 's , I 'm not limited to offering you legal counsel only , my friend . I 'm also learned in the ways of the heart , and can offer you this advice - nail her , get it out of your system , and move on . Like we say at Sloss Law - good fences make good neighbors .
BANKY: She 'd never let him in her yard . The chick 's gay .
SLOSS: She 's gay ? You fell for a gay , comic- ook writing chick ? Holden , you poor , poor man ! Wait a sec - does she have epresentation !
BANKY: Always working , you . Look at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a string of pearls hanging our of he ass ,
SLOSS: Would you leave his stuff alone ! You can break her resolve , killer . All it takes is one good man . But if it takes two good men , do n't hesitate to call me . That being said , in egards to the more pressing issue , I suggest you leave art to the museums and grab on with both hands to the ig , fat check .
HOLDEN: I 'll give it some thought
BANKY: I 'm taking this as a precaution - just in case they give us any shit about pussy 's decision delay . You 'll 'give it some thought ' . You 're so retarded
HOLDEN: I 'm retarded ! This from the guy who only forty five minutes ago paid fifty ucks for what 's supposed to be a boot- leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers ' with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel wearing a French Tickler .
SLOSS: How 'd you fall for that !
BANKY: The guy who sold it to me had an honest face .
ALYSSA: Somebody told me that they make comic ooks here , and I 've got an idea fo this story about a guy who comes to a club and high-tails it when he finds out this girl is pay . Any interest in a story like that ! Holden smiles .
HOLDEN: Twelve episodes .
ALYSSA: That 's great , is n't it ?
HOLDEN: Banky seems to think so .
ALYSSA: But you do n't .
HOLDEN: I do n't know if that 's the perception I want people to have of our stuff . I know this sounds pretentious as hell , ut I like to think of us as artists . And I 'd like to get back to doing something more personal - like ou first book .
ALYSSA: Well when are you going to do that ?
HOLDEN: As soon as we have something personal to say .
ALYSSA: Do you know how pretty you are ?
HOLDEN: What ?
ALYSSA: You 're a pretty man .
HOLDEN: Uh thanks .
ALYSSA: Oh . I get it . I 'm into girls , so I have to find all men repulsive o something .
HOLDEN: I did n't say anything .
ALYSSA: Are n't there some men that you find attractive ? Granted , not enough to sleep with , but still - just handsome or something !
HOLDEN: Sure . Harrison Ford . And our mail- man .
ALYSSA: Well it 's the same thing . I look at you and just find you really handsome . And you know , it has very little to do with your look , per-se . Your look is fine , do n't get me wrong . But it 's more your outlook . The things you say , the way you see things . It 's I do n't know attractive , Holden looks away , embarrassed ,
HOLDEN: Huh ! No , not really .
ALYSSA: Come on .
HOLDEN: It 's just that we've.. , I mean , I 've never seen that kind of thing up close and personal . It just took awhile to process , longer than usual .
ALYSSA: Do you want to talk about it !
HOLDEN: Um . If you want to .
ALYSSA: I like you . I have n't liked a man in a long time . And I 'm not a man-hate or something . It 's just been some time since I 've been exposed to a man that did n't immediately live-into a stereotype of some sort . And I want you to feel comfortable with me , ecause I want us to be friends . So if there are things you 'd like to know , it 's okay to ask me .
HOLDEN: Why girls ?
ALYSSA: Why men ?
HOLDEN: Because that 's the standard
ALYSSA: If that 's the only reason you 're attracted to women - because it 's the standard..
HOLDEN: It 's more than that .
ALYSSA: So you 've never been curious about men ?
HOLDEN: Curious about men ? Well I always wondered why my father watched 'Hee- Haw ' .
ALYSSA: You know what I mean .
HOLDEN: No .
ALYSSA: Why not !
HOLDEN: No interest .
ALYSSA: Because ?
HOLDEN: Girls feel right .
ALYSSA: And that 's how I feel . I 've neve eally been attracted to men . I 'm more comfortable with the idea of girls .
HOLDEN: Wait , wait , wait - you 're still a virgin ?
ALYSSA: No .
HOLDEN: But you 've only been with girls .
ALYSSA: You 're saying a person 's a virgin until they 've had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex ?
HOLDEN: Is n't that the standard definition ?
ALYSSA: Again with the standards . I think virginity is lost when you make love for the first time .
HOLDEN: With a member of the opposite sex .
ALYSSA: Why ? Why only then ?
HOLDEN: Because that 's the standard .
ALYSSA: So if a virgin is raped , then she 's still a virgin ?
HOLDEN: Of course not .
ALYSSA: But rape is not the standard . So she 's had sex , but not the standard idea of sex . Hence , according to your definition , she 'd still be a virgin .
HOLDEN: Okay , I 'll revise . Virginity is lost when the hymen is broken .
ALYSSA: Then I lost my virginity at ten , ecause I fell on a fence post when I was ten , and it broke my hymen . Now I have to tell people that I lost it to a wooden post I 'd known my whole young life ?
HOLDEN: Second revision - virginity is lost through penetration .
ALYSSA: Physical penetration or emotional ?
HOLDEN: Emotional ?
ALYSSA: Well , I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree when we were in high school .
HOLDEN: Physical penetration .
ALYSSA: We had sex .
HOLDEN: Yeah , but not real sex .
ALYSSA: I move to have that remark stricken from the record . On account of it makes you come off as completely naive and infantile .
HOLDEN: Well where 's the penetration in lesbian sex . Alyssa holds up her hand .
ALYSSA: Did I hold up a finger ?
HOLDEN: You 're kidding ? ! ? ! How ? ! ?
ALYSSA: Our bodies are built to pass a child , for Christ 's sake .
HOLDEN: But does n't it hurt ? !
ALYSSA: Sure . But in a good way . And it 's only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved for really special occasions .
HOLDEN: What about not-so-special occasions ?
ALYSSA: Tongue only .
HOLDEN: But how can that be enough ? I mean , let 's be real - how big can a tongue even get ?
ALYSSA: Let 's go .
HOLDEN: Justuh just give me a moment .
BANKY: I got the Sega in one bag , my clothes in the other , and two months worth of unread comics in this one .
HOLDEN: We 're going to a convention , for the love of God . We 'll be busy from ten 'till eight each day . When are you possibly going to have time for any of that shit ? In fact , fuck it - you 're leaving some of this shit here in a locker . Come on - give me the two that are n't clothes .
BANKY: Hold on .
HOLDEN: What are you doing ?
BANKY: I just have to get something .
HOLDEN: Who are you , Larry fucking Flynt ? What are you going to do with all of those ?
BANKY: Read the articles . What do you think I 'm going to do with them ? They 're stroke books .
HOLDEN: You 've got like thirty books there ! We 're only there for two days !
BANKY: Variety 's the spice of life . I like a wide selection . Sometimes I 'm in the mood for nasty close-ups , sometimes I like them arty and air-brushed . Some times it 's a spread brown-eye kind of night , sometimes it 's girl-on-girl time . Sometimes a steamy letter will do it , sometimes - not often , but sometimes - I like the idea of a chick with a horse .
HOLDEN: Go check us in . I 've got ta call Alyssa .
BANKY: His master 's voice .
HOLDEN: Put that stuff away .
KID: What are those ?
BANKY: Do you Like horsies ?
ALYSSA: I hope for the sake of the women you 've dated that you 're only this quick in returning calls .
HOLDEN: What 's up ? I 'm about to get on a plane .
ALYSSA: Ohhh . Why !
HOLDEN: Last minute invite to the Dragon Con ' .
ALYSSA: Shit .
HOLDEN: What ?
ALYSSA: My sister 's at my parents ' . I was gon na go see her .
HOLDEN: The one that wrote the book ?
ALYSSA: Yeah . But I was staying all weekend , and I wanted to hang our with you . This sucks .
HOLDEN: You did n't get invited to the Con ' ?
ALYSSA: I do n't do southern con 's - all the chicks have that annoying drawl . You know how hard it is nor to laugh when someone moans `` Fuhhk me '' ?
HOLDEN: Well this sucks . You know - both of us do n't have to go .
ALYSSA: Really ?
HOLDEN: Yeah . Banky can go by himself . It 's not like we 're on a panel . It was just a signing appearance .
ALYSSA: If you come pick me up , I 'll be you est friend .
HOLDEN: Where 's your apartment ?
ALYSSA: I 'm not there . I 'm at a friend 's - in the Village . Corner of Houston and Mercer . Number eighty six , apartment
HOLDEN: I 'll be there in half an hour .
ALYSSA: You 're so easy .
BANKY: And then Black Beauty could n't take it any longer , and he finally did some of his own mounting .
KID: Wow . Holden grabs Banky 's arm and drags him away .
HOLDEN: What are you doing ?
BANKY: I think I want kids of my own one day . They 're fun .
HOLDEN: Listen to me - I 'm not going . You 're going to have to do this one by yourself .
BANKY: What ? Why ?
HOLDEN: Alyssa 's coming down for the weekend , so I want to hang out with her . You do n't need me for this . Meantime , I 'll take this stuff home . You can keep the filth . I 'll pick you up at nine Sunday night , alright ? Do n't forget to plug the Annual and do n't mention the t.v . show , okay ? Call me if you get bored .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Checking in , sir !
BANKY: Hunhh ! Yeah . But this is carry-on .
WOMAN: Let me guess - 'the right man ' ?
HOLDEN: Excuse me ?
WOMAN: You 've got it in your head that Alyssa 's not really into chicks - that she just has n't met the right man . And you believe you 're it . You 're going to treat her right , fuck he like a stud , and 'straight-jacket ' he ack from the land of the lost . And the sad truth is that you 'll accomplish none of that and wind up as either an even more bitter misogynist or a reverse fag-hag .
ALYSSA: Do n't mind her . That 's just her way a saying hello .
WOMAN: Actually , it 's just my way of saying `` Give it up . ''
ALYSSA: You 're such an asshole .
WOMAN: When you file the date-rape charges , do n't say I did n't warn you .
HOLDEN: I 'm Holden , by the way .
WOMAN: I 'm the voice of reason that Miss Bitch is having such a hard time listening to .
HOLDEN: Look , we 're just friends .
WOMAN: That 's what every guy says before he tries purring your hand on his dick .
HOLDEN: And how do you know men so well ?
WOMAN: Because I lapdance for a living , dick- head . She slams the door . Holden looks to Alyssa .
ALYSSA: Ohhh - you look so cute ! She heads down the stairs .
HOLDEN: Who was that ?
ALYSSA: Just an occasional friend .
HOLDEN: Why would you want to hang our with someone bitter as that ?
ALYSSA: Remember this ! Her 's is even bigger than that .
HOLDEN: Yeah . You ?
ALYSSA: Baptist .
HOLDEN: Really ? Did you have a strict upbringing ?
ALYSSA: Please There was no time to be bad - we were too busy saying 'Jesus ' .
HOLDEN: You think your upbringing had something to do with your lifestyle choice ?
ALYSSA: Somewhere along the line . It 's a gradual transition to make - from doing what the majority does to taking a leap of faith and doing what feels more natural . Everything helps - from the way you were handled as a kid , to the way the boys acted in third grade , to the shoes you wore at your freshman prom .
HOLDEN: Shoes ?
ALYSSA: Well they were really tight .
HOLDEN: Come in .
ALYSSA: I read somewhere that guys who play hockey are merely making up for penile deficiencies by carrying big sticks .
BANKY: I thought you lived in the city ? This is like the umpteenth time I 've seen you here . Is n't that grounds enough for the little pink mafia to throw you out of their club ?
HOLDEN: I 'll be ready in a second . I just have to school this mouthy second-stringer .
BANKY: Bitch , you 're schooling no one .
HOLDEN: What ? Do something !
BANKY: You fucking cock-teaser . I 'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass .
HOLDEN: Look at how slow you are . Christ , you move like a geriatric .
BANKY: Fuck ! You Fucking cock-sucker , man ! These faggots wo n't do what I tell them to !
HOLDEN: Oh . It 's the controller , right ? It 's always the controller .
BANKY: No , it 's these fucking queers on lades that ca n't accept a fucking pass to save their lives ! What period is this ?
HOLDEN: Final sixty of the third .
BANKY: Fuck ! Look at your fucking guys , they FUCK ! ! !
HOLDEN: Imagine if I 'd only beaten him by one instead of thirty .
ALYSSA: Explain this again .
HOLDEN: How could you have grown up down the shore and never played skee-ball ? What did you do with your youth ? They head toward the skee-ball runs .
ALYSSA: Stayed out late , smoked pot , screwed around .
HOLDEN: Not your grade school years ; your high school years .
ALYSSA: This looks complicated .
HOLDEN: The premise is very basic - you roll the ball up the ramp at varying speeds , in an effort to pop it into the score circles . The higher the score , the more prize tickets you get .
ALYSSA: What do you do with the prize tickets ?
HOLDEN: Trade them in for prizes that are n't worth nearly as much as you paid to play the game .
ALYSSA: Then what 's the point ?
HOLDEN: It 's fun .
ALYSSA: And you question my lifestyle .
HOLDEN: Observe .
ALYSSA: Why not just walk up there and put it in the fifty every time ?
HOLDEN: Where 's the skill in that ?
ALYSSA: Oh , this is a skill ? I 'm sorry , I had no idea .
HOLDEN: Just toss one .
ALYSSA: This is where you take straight chicks on dates ?
HOLDEN: It 's like Spanish Fly . This 'll probably be the first time I do n't score afterwards .
ALYSSA: I do n't know . I 'm starting to get a tingle in my bottom . Ten .
HOLDEN: So what 'd you do last night ?
ALYSSA: Got laid
HOLDEN: Maybe we should just leave before somebody gets hurt .
ALYSSA: No way . I want a cheap prize . So your friend 's quite the homophobe .
HOLDEN: He just feels left out , I think .
ALYSSA: I 'm not talking about his infantile hang-up with me . I 'm talking about when you two were playing that game . Everytime he swore - when his players messed up , he called them cocksuckers , he referred to the players as queers , he called you a cock-teaser
HOLDEN: I thought he was talking to you .
ALYSSA: I know you think it means nothing , and it may in fact be unintentional , but it 's ugly all the same .
HOLDEN: He was just pissed he was losing .
ALYSSA: So he slams the gay community ?
HOLDEN: C'mon . Do n't get all p.c . on me .
ALYSSA: I 'm not . But what is that saying ?
HOLDEN: It says he gets too easily frustrated .
ALYSSA: It 's passive/agressive gay-bashing .
HOLDEN: How do you figure ?
ALYSSA: How casually did it roll off his tongue ? And that 's how he expresses his anger ? By calling people faggots ?
HOLDEN: I think you 're reading too much into it .
ALYSSA: I think you 're just so used to it that it rolls off your back . I 've heard the two of you play your little rank out game where one insists the othe is gay . `` You 're a faggot . No , you 're a faggot . '' It 's cute and all to watch you go at it like grade-schooler , but it 's also offensive - labeling and ducking the label of being gay as if it were the scarlet fucking letter .
HOLDEN: You 're blowing this way out of proportion . We live in a more tolerant age now . You refer to yourself as a dyke . Hooper calls himself a faggot all the time
ALYSSA: Yeah , but that 's what 's known as empowerment/disempowerment . I call myself a dyke so it 's not too devastating when some throwback screams it at me as I 'm leaving a ba at night . Same for Hooper - by calling himself a faggot , he steals the thunder away from the mouthy jerks of this world who 'd like to beat him to it . But the difference between us having it and your friend saying it is miles wide . We say it to mask the pain - you say it for lack of a better expression at any given moment . No Holden , we do not live in a more tolerant age . And if you think that 's the case , then you 've been in the suburbs way too long to be resuscitated . Holden kind of sulks . Alyssa notices .
HOLDEN: How bad do you suck !
BANKY: How was your pseudo-date ?
HOLDEN: Leave it alone .
BANKY: That chick bugs me .
HOLDEN: Aww . Everyone bugs you .
BANKY: Get off . Fucking faggot ! Did you see that ? ! Your dyke courting ass just got me scored on !
HOLDEN: You know , you should watch that . If you 're going to get all bent out of shape while playing the game , so much so that you need to curse the t.v. , try not to gay-bash it , alright . You 're nor that kind of guy . And do n't call her a dyke , alright ? She 's a lesbian .
BANKY: What the fuck is going on here ?
HOLDEN: I 'm starting a new page .
BANKY: Not with this shit ! With you . What the fuck is going on with you and that girl ?
HOLDEN: We 're friends .
BANKY: She 's programming you .
HOLDEN: I beg your pardon ? Programming ?
BANKY: Yeah . And apparently , you do n't even ealize it . What does it matter if I efer to her as a dyke , or if I call the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the privacy of my own office , far from the sensitive ears of the rest of the world ?
HOLDEN: It 's passive/aggressive gay-bashing ; and I know you 're not really prejudiced at heart . You should just find some other way to express you anger , is all I 'm saying .
BANKY: Bear with me here . I just want to put you through this little exercise . Okay , now see this ? This is a fou way road , okay ?
HOLDEN: What is this supposed to prove ?
BANKY: I 'm serious . This is a serious exercise . It 's like an S.A.T . question . Which one 's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first - the male-friendly lesbian , the man-hating dyke , Santa Claus , or the Easte Bunny ?
HOLDEN: The man-hating dyke .
BANKY: Good . Why ?
HOLDEN: I do n't know .
HOLDEN: I do n't need this . I 'm going home .
BANKY: She 's fucking with your mind , man ! She knows you 've got this schoolboy crush and she 's using it to sway you way of thinking !
HOLDEN: And why would she need to do that ? What is she Mata fucking Hari ? ! What does she gain ?
BANKY: Maybe she thinks you 'll get her comic picked up by Contender . Or maybe she thinks you 'll change the content of our book to something more political and message oriented . Or , gee - I do n't know - maybe because that 's just what dykes like to do fuck around with straight guys ' heads , just so she can go back to her little rug-munche club and have a good laugh with all her man-hating harpy cronies about how fucking stupid and easily duped men are !
HOLDEN: You 're so out of line right now.. ,
BANKY: You do n't even know this girl ! Big deal , she 's from Middletown and she went to North ! All the girls at North were bitches and sluts anyway ! And this one 's got them beat by a mile ecause she 's a bitch/slut/dyke !
HOLDEN: Watch your fucking mouth , is all I 'm going to tell you..
BANKY: Oh why ? Do you get my back when she ashes me ? Because I know she does . And do you know why she does ? Because I wo n't play her fucking game !
HOLDEN: Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious ullshit is amusing . Sometimes it 's just fucking annoying as piss !
BANKY: What is it about this girl ? You know you have no shot at getting her into ed ! Why do you bother wasting time with her ? Because you 're Holden fucking McNeil - most persistent traveller on the road that 's not the path of least resistance ! Everything 's got ta be a fucking challenge for you , and this little elationship with that bitch is a prime example of your fucking condition . Well I do n't need a fucking magic eight ball to look into your future ; you want a forecast ? Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa . What a shock - `` Not fucking likely '' ! This relationship of your 's is affecting you , our work and ou friendship , and the time 's going to come when I throw down the gauntlet and say it 's me or her ! And then what 're you going to say ? !
HOLDEN: I think you should let this one go .
BANKY: No , what would you say ? Would you trash twenty years of friendship ecause you 've got some idiotic notion that this chick would even let you sniff her panties , let alone fuck her ? !
HOLDEN: Let it go
BANKY: What the fuck.. WHAT THE FUCK MAKES
HOLDEN: I 'm in love with her , man .
BANKY: Fuck .
HOLDEN: I wish you were the one being pursued y M-TV .
ALYSSA: Oh really ?
HOLDEN: Sure . Then you could sell our and maybe pick up the check once in awhile .
ALYSSA: We 're leaving !
HOLDEN: Well it 's not like this is a bed and eakfast ,
ALYSSA: I 've got a little business to conduct .
CASHIER: You wan na haggle over the price of your French Dip ?
ALYSSA: I want to haggle over the price of fine art .
CASHIER: What do you mean ?
ALYSSA: There . By the kitchen . That painting .
CASHIER: What about it ?
ALYSSA: The price tag says seventy five .
CASHIER: So !
HOLDEN: Tell me you 're kidding !
ALYSSA: I 'll give you fifty .
CASHIER: Manuel ! Bring , me the Dyksiezski off the wall . All my years in the diner business , I 've waited for this day - the day when someone wanted to buy one of the pictures .
ALYSSA: Alyssa Jones . Pleased to meet you .
CASHIER: You say you want to haggle , but you do n't know rule one about haggling , which you just broke you never give your name . The name is power , and to give the opponent that piece of you is to give away victory .
ALYSSA: I 'm only trying to conduct a transaction . We 're not opponents .
CASHIER: ( accepting painting from
BUSBOY: Oh , but we are - if you think I 'm letting this beautiful piece go fo fifty .
ALYSSA: Ah-ha ! Now we 're haggling .
HOLDEN: I 've always wondered what kind of people buy those things . I ca n't elieve you talked him down to twenty five !
ALYSSA: It was looking shakey when he told me the artist was a blind cripple with a hump-back , but I held my ground . There 's no room for sympathy in the uyer 's market .
HOLDEN: Where are you going to hang it ?
ALYSSA: I 'm not . You are .
HOLDEN: You want me to hang it for you ? You etter hope it does n't get out to the girl-nation that you needed a man to help you hang a picture .
ALYSSA: You 're going to hang it in your house . I bought it for you .
HOLDEN: Yeah , right .
ALYSSA: I 'm serious . Holden stares at her .
HOLDEN: Why ?
ALYSSA: Because it 's captured the moment . It 'll be a constant reminder - not just of tonight , but of ou introduction , the building of ou friendship , everything . Make no mistake about it my Friend - it 's a gift to you , from me , so you 'll always emember us .
HOLDEN: Because I ca n't take it .
ALYSSA: Ca n't take what ?
HOLDEN: I love you .
ALYSSA: You love me .
HOLDEN: I love you . And not in a friendly way , although I think we 're great friends . And not in a misplaced affection , puppy-dog way , although I 'm sure that 's what you 'll call it . And it 's not because you 're unattainable . I love you . Very simple , very truly . You 're the epitome of every attribute and quality I 've ever looked for in another person . I know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option you 'd ever consider . But I ca n't do this any longer . I ca n't stand next to you without wanting to hold you . I ca n't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only ead about in trashy romance novels . I ca n't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are . I know this will probably quee our friendship - no pun intended - but I had to say it , because I 've neve felt this before , and I like who I am ecause of it . And if bringing it to light means we ca n't hang out anymore , then that hurts me . But I could n't allow another day to go by without getting it out there , regardless of the outcome , which by the look on you face is to be the inevitable shoot- down . And I 'll accept that But I know some part of you is hesitating for a moment , and if there is a moment of hesitation , that means you feel something too . All I ask is that you not suppress that - at least for ten minutes - and try to dwell in it efore you dismiss it . There is n't another soul on this fucking planet who 's ever made me the person I am when I 'm with you , and I would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau . Because it 's there between you and me . You ca n't deny that . And even if we never speak again after tonight , please know that I 'm forever changed ecause of you and what you 've meant to me , which - while I do appreciate it - I 'd never need a painting of irds bought at a diner to remind me of .
ALYSSA: Get back in the car and get out of here .
HOLDEN: You 're going to hitch to New York ?
ALYSSA: Y'ep .
HOLDEN: Are n't you at least going to comment ?
ALYSSA: Here 's my comment fuck you .
HOLDEN: Why ?
ALYSSA: That was so unfair . You know how unfair that was .
HOLDEN: It 's unfair that I 'm in love with you ?
ALYSSA: No , it 's unfortunate that you 're in love with me . It 's unfair that you felt the fucking need to unburden you soul about it . Do you remember for a fucking second who I am ?
HOLDEN: So ? People change .
ALYSSA: Oh , it 's that simple ? You fall in love with me and want a romantic elationship , nothing changes for you with the exception of feeling hunky- dorey all the time . But what about- me ? It 's not that simple , is it ? I ca n't just get into a relationship with you without throwing my whole fucking world into upheaval !
HOLDEN: But that 's every relationship ! There 's always going to be a period of adjustment .
ALYSSA: Period of adjustment ? ! ?
HOLDEN: If this is a crush then I do n't know if I could take the real thing if it ever happens .
ALYSSA: Go home , Holden .
HOLDEN: Stay here .
BANKY: Catholic school girls .
HOLDEN: You looked weirded out back there .
BANKY: That 's my couch you were fucking on .
HOLDEN: Sorry .
BANKY: I wanted to watch some TV . Hard to do when your best friend 's wrapped around a naked rug-muncher on your couch .
HOLDEN: She had boxers on .
BANKY: This is all going to end badly .
HOLDEN: You do n't know that .
BANKY: I know you . You 're way too conservative for that girl . She 's een around and seen things we 've only ead about in books .
HOLDEN: But we have read about them . So we 're prepared .
BANKY: There 's no 'we ' here . You 're going to have to go through this alone . And it 's one thing to read about shit , and something different when you 're forced to deal with it on a regular basis . When you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick , it 's going to eat you up inside . You 'll spend most of your time wondering when the othe shoe 's going to drop . Because fo you , this is n't about cool weird sex stuff , it 's about love .
HOLDEN: Maybe it is for her as well .
BANKY: Somehow I doubt it .
HOLDEN: Everyone 's not out to get someone in life . Bank .
BANKY: Everybody has an agenda . Everyone .
HOLDEN: Yourself ?
BANKY: My agenda is to watch your back .
HOLDEN: To what end ?
BANKY: To insure that all this time we 've spent together , building something , was n't wasted .
HOLDEN: She 's not going to ruin the comic .
BANKY: I was n't talking about the comic . I 'm going to gel a bagel . Clean off my fucking couch so I can watch TV . Banky walks away . Holden shakes his head .
DALIA: From what I understand , when you sign with a publisher , someone else does all this work for you , and you just sit back and collect .
ALYSSA: And miss these last minute cram sessions with my nearest and dearest ? Never .
TORY: I do n't know what she 's bitching about . All she 's done since we got here is pound Merlot .
DALIA: I 'm sorry were n't you the one who misspelled 'receipt ' on page eighteen ? Yeah , you 're a real help .
NICA: What I 'd like to know is why we 're here at all when we have n't seen Princess funny-Book in a month .
JANE: Yeah Alyssa - who 've you been shacking up with ?
ALYSSA: 'Shacking up ! ' Please . I 'm so in love !
DALIA: Who is it ? Do n't even tell me it 's Ms. Thing from the C.D . place . I 'll kill you .
ALYSSA: It 's not her . It 's someone you guys do n't know .
NICA: That chick you left the restaurant with that night ?
ALYSSA: They 're not . From around here .
TORY: Do n't even tell me you met her down the shore !
JANE: Eww ! Not a bridge-and-tunnel Jersey dyke !
TORY: With huge hair and acid-washed jeans !
DALIA: Come on , Alyss - Hoboken Hussy o what ?
ALYSSA: For your information , they do n't have ig hair or wear acid wash . They 're from my home town . Dalia stares at Alyssa , suspiciously .
DALIA: Why are you playing the pronoun game ?
ALYSSA: What ? What are you talking about ? I 'm not even .
DALIA: You are . `` I met someone . '' `` We have a great time . `` They 're from my home town . '' Does n't this tube of wonderful have a name !
ALYSSA: Holden .
JANE: Oh , Alyssa - no . Not you .
TORY: You 're dating a guy ?
ALYSSA: He 's not like a typical man . He 's eally sweet to me , and we relate so well . You guys 'd love him , really . They stare at Alyssa . Then Dalia gets up .
DALIA: I 've got ta go to the store .
JANE: I 'll go with . They exit . Alyssa looks to Tory and Nica .
TORY: Whelp - here 's to both of you . Another one bites the dust .
HOLDEN: Can I ask you something ?
ALYSSA: Do n't even tell me you want to do it again .
HOLDEN: Why me - you know ? Why now ?
ALYSSA: Because you were giving me that look , and I got wet
HOLDEN: You know what I 'm talking about .
ALYSSA: Why not You ?
HOLDEN: I 'm a guy . You 're attracted to girls .
ALYSSA: I see you 've been taking notes . Historically , yes that 's true .
HOLDEN: Then why this ?
ALYSSA: I 've given that a lot of thought , you know ? I mean , now that I 'm being ostracized by my friends , I 've had a lot of time to think about all of this . And what I 've come up with is eally simple I came to this on my terms . I did n't just heed what I was taught , you know ? Men and women should be together , it 's the natural way - that kind of thing . I 'm not with you because of what family , society , life tried to instill in me from day one . The way the world is - how seldom you meet that one person who gets you it 's so rare . My parents did n't really have it . There was no example set for me in the world of male/female relation ships . And to cut oneself off from finding that person - to immediately half you options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within you own gender that just seemed stupid . So I did n't . And by leaving my options open , I was branded 'gay ' , which to me was no big deal - labels are labels , you know ? They define what you do , not who you are , I guess . But then you come along . You - the one least likely ; I mean , you were a guy .
HOLDEN: Still am .
ALYSSA: And while I was falling for you , I put a ceiling on that , because you were a guy . Until I remembered why I opened the door to women in the first place - to not limit the likelihood of finding that one person who 'd compliment me so completely . And so here we are , I was thorough when I looked for you , and I feel justified lying in your arms - ecause I got here on my terms , and have no question that there was someplace I did n't look . And that makes all the difference .
HOLDEN: Shit .
ALYSSA: What ?
HOLDEN: Well , you took the luster our of it .
ALYSSA: What luster ?
HOLDEN: Of how I brought you back from the other side . How all you needed was the right man to turn you around .
ALYSSA: You 're not the right man . You 're just the one .
HOLDEN: Can I at least cell people that all you needed was some serious deep- dicking ? She hits him with her pillow .
BANKY: Check out page forty eight .
HOLDEN: So ?
BANKY: Did you see the nickname ?
HOLDEN: 'Finger Cuffs ' .
BANKY: And ?
HOLDEN: And she had a weird nick-name . What 's your point ?
BANKY: Do you know why it 's 'Finger Cuffs ' ?
HOLDEN: I suppose you do .
BANKY: I do . You remember Cohee Lundin ? Left Hudson and went to North our senio year ?
HOLDEN: Yeah .
BANKY: Well , I ran into him at Food City the other day , and we got to talking , and I mentioned that you were dating Alyssa , and he said..
COHEE: Alyssa Jones ? Shit . I know Alyssa Jones . I mean , I know Alyssa Jones , you know what I 'm saying ? Me and Rick Derris used to hang ou with her for awhile , right ? Just hanging around her house after school , 'cuz her parents were like never home , and shit . And one day , Rick just whips it out , and starts rubbing it on her leg and shit ; chasing her around the living room - I was dying . But you know what the crazy bitch did ? She fucking drops to her knees , and just starts sucking him off right in front of me ! Like I was n't even there man ! I almost died ! But that 's not the fucked up part - the fucked up part was Rick , man - right in the middle of it , he turns to me and he 's pointing at her and he says `` Cohee . '' Just like that - `` Cohee . '' So I 'm like I 'll give it a shot . And I start pulling her pants down all slow , 'cuz I figure any second she 's gon na turn around and belt me in the mouth , ight ? But yo , check this shit out - she 's all into it man ! She do n't try to stop me or nothing ! She 's all wet and shit , and I just went to work , know what I 'm saying ? Me and Rick are going to town on this crazy itch , and she 's just loving it , all moaning and shit ! It was fucked up ! So Rick 's the one that came up with the nickname - 'cuz that day , she had us locked in tight from both sides - like a pair of goddamn Chinese finge cuffs ! BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky .
HOLDEN: He 's full of shit .
BANKY: Cohee 's a lot of things , but an exxagerator he 's not . The dude 's Catholic .
HOLDEN: She 's never even been with a guy .
BANKY: That 's what she says . But I say he on her hands and knees getting filled out like an application constitutes 'being with a guy ' .
HOLDEN: He 's pulling your chain . And the fact that you even bought it for a second makes you look like an idiot .
BANKY: I 'm getting your back , asshole ! People do n't forget shit like 'Finge Cuffs ' . And if it got out that she 's queer as well , how do you think it 's going to make you look ?
HOLDEN: I give a shit what people think .
BANKY: Alright , forget about that ; what if she 's carrying a disease ? That was just one story - what if there 's more ?
HOLDEN: You 're such a fucking asshole .
BANKY: What ? Oh , it 's not possible that she 's all crudded up ? Cohee I can vouch for as clean - the dude neve got laid in high school . But Derris is an arch fucking bush-man ! Name me one chick in our senior class that Rick Derris did n't nail , for Christ 's sake !
HOLDEN: Would you let this go ? I 'm telling you - she 's never even been with a guy , let alone those two zeroes .
BANKY: And I 'm telling you , the bitch could e a bigger fucking germ farm than that monkey in 'Outbreak ' !
HOLDEN: Give it a rest ! Do you hear me ? ! I 'm tired of this shit ! She 's my goddamn girlfriend , do you understand ? ! Show her a little fucking respect ! And if you ever even so much as mention that Alyssa looks a little peaked from now on , I 'll put you fucking teeth down your throat !
BANKY: Maybe I 'll put your fucking teeth down your throat .
HOLDEN: Not bloody Likely . Banky runs to the open door .
BANKY: I 've been working out you know ! You better be ready to make that M-TV deal !
HOOPER: Where 's that bitch partner of your 's een ?
HOLDEN: Sulking . He 's having a real problem with this Alyssa thing .
HOOPER: I think it 's more like Banky 's having a problem with all things not hetero ight about now . And I 'm just anothe paradigm of said aberration .
HOLDEN: Banky does not hate gays , you know that .
HOOPER: But I do think he is a bit homophobic . And this latest episode between you and Ms. Thing has tapped into that . In his warped perception , he lost you to the dark side - which is she .
HOLDEN: You make it sound like me and him were dating .
HOOPER: Do n't kid yourself - that boy loves you in a way that he 's not ready to deal with .
HOLDEN: He 's been digging up dirt on Alyssa .
HOOPER: And just what has Mister Angela Lansbury uncovered about your lady fair ?
HOLDEN: He heard some bullshit story that she took on two guys .
HOOPER: Really ? Well then he 's barking up the wrong we if he wants to split you up , is n't he ? He 's not going to make you see the error of your ways by pointing out how truly gay she 's not This one ?
HOLDEN: Have it . Actually , it 's kind of gotten to me .
HOOPER: How so ?
HOLDEN: Banky 's not known for believing misinformation . He 's got a pretty good bullshit detector .
HOOPER: So , what if it is true ? Would that other you ?
HOLDEN: Sex with multiple partners ? Hooper lets our a faux-shock shriek .
HOOPER: So what do you care ?
HOLDEN: Well that 's the thing , is n't it ? I shouldn't.. but it gets to me .
HOOPER: Kind of gal Alyssa is , you do n't think she 's been in the middle of an all - girl group-grope ?
HOLDEN: You see - that does n't bother me . But the thought of her and guys Uh !
HOOPER: Oh Holden , I beg you - please do n't drop fifty stories in my opinion of you by falling prey to that latest of trendy beasts .
HOLDEN: Which is ?
HOOPER: Lesbian chic . It 's oh-so acceptable to be a gay girl nowadays . People think it 's cute , because they 've got this fool picture in their heads about lipstick lesbians - like they all esemble Alyssa - while most of them look more like you .
HOLDEN: Do I detect a little inter-subculture cattiness ?
HOOPER: Gay or straight - ugly 's still ugly . And most of those boys are scary .
HOLDEN: I thought fags were all supposed to be super-supportive of one another .
HOOPER: Screw that 'all for one ' shit . I got ta deal with being the minority in the minority of the minority , and nobody 's supporting my ass ? While the whole of society is fawning over girls- on-girls , here I sit - a reviled gay man , and to top that off , I 'm a gay lack man - notoriously the most swishy of the bunch .
HOLDEN: Three strikes .
HOOPER: Hey , hey ! There 's a line .
KID: Are you Hooper X ?
HOOPER: A-salaam Alaikum , little brother .
KID: Could you sign my comic ?
HOOPER: See that guy there ? He 's the devil , you understand ? Never take your eye off the Man . Our people took thei eyes off him one time , and he had us in chains in two shakes of his snake 's tail .
KID: Word is bond
HOOPER: Look at what I have to resort to fo professional respect . What is it about gay men that terrifies the rest of the world . As for this hang-up with Alyssa 's past , maybe what 's really bothering you is that your fragile fantasy might not be true .
HOLDEN: What do you mean ?
HOOPER: Holden - do n't even try to come off like you do n't know what I 'm saying . Men need to believe that they 're Marco fucking Polo when it comes to sex - like they 're the only ones who 've eve explored new territory . And it 's hard not to let them believe it . I let my oys run with it for awhile - feed them some of that `` I 've never done this before '' bullshit , and let 'em labor under the delusion that they ockin ' my world , until I ca n't stand them anymore . Then I hit 'em with the truth . It 's a sick game . The world would be a better place if people would just accept that there 's nothing new under the sun , and everything you can do with a person has probably been done long before you got there .
HOLDEN: I can accept that .
HOOPER: Honey , that almost sounded convincing . Do yourself a favor - just ask he about her past , point blank . Get it out of the way , before it gets too big for both ya 'll to move . Oooh ! 'Myra Breckinridge ' !
ALYSSA: Since most of these people are rooting for the home team , I 'm going to chee for the visitors . I 'm a big visitors fan - especially the kind that make coffee for you in the morning before they go . That was a joke . A little wacky wordplay ?
HOLDEN: What do you mean , 'visitors ' ?
ALYSSA: Was I being too obscure ? The kind that - until recently - had no dicks and would spend the night .
HOLDEN: So that was until recently !
ALYSSA: Oh , yeah . Hey - foul ! Foul ! He was traveling or something !
HOLDEN: So nobody bur me has stayed the night at your place since we got together ?
ALYSSA: Something on your mind , Holden ?
HOLDEN: No , I was just wondering ,
ALYSSA: If I 've been 'faithful ' or something ?
HOLDEN: Look , I was just asking .
ALYSSA: Oh , sweetie . I only have eyes fo you .
HOLDEN: That 'd make Banky half right .
ALYSSA: About what ?
HOLDEN: He said all the girls from North were itches and sluts .
ALYSSA: Really . I 'm sorry - you two left high school behind how many years ago ? Can I put some of my books in you locker ?
HOLDEN: How about your yearbook .
HOLDEN: What 's with 'Finger Cuffs ' ?
ALYSSA: 'Finger Cuffs ' ?
HOLDEN: Yeah . In your senior yearbook you nickname was 'Finger Cuffs ' . What is that ?
ALYSSA: It was ? Shit , damned if I can emember . I 'd look it up , but I threw all that shit our years ago ? Where 'd you see a North yearbook ?
HOLDEN: Do you know Rick Derris ?
ALYSSA: Rick ? Sure . We used to hang out in high school .
HOLDEN: Did you go out with him or something ?
ALYSSA: Date Rick Derris ? No . We just hung out a lot .
HOLDEN: Just you and him ?
ALYSSA: No . Me , Rick , and um what was that guy 's name ?
HOLDEN: Cohee ?
ALYSSA: Yeah ! Cohee Lundin . God , I have n't thought about that name in years .
HOLDEN: Rick pulled his dick out ? Really ? What 'd you do ?
ALYSSA: I blew him while Cohee fucked me .
HOLDEN: Excuse me ! ? !
ALYSSA: That 's what you wanted to hear , is n't it ? Is n't that what this little cross- examination of your 's is about ? Well try not to be so obvious about it next time , there are subtler ways of adgering a witness . Am I right ?
BYSTANDER: Jeez , even I knew what you were getting at .
ALYSSA: If you wanted some background information on me , all you had to do was ask - I 'd have gladly volunteered it . You did n't have to play Hercules fucking Poirot !
BYSTANDER: I told you these were good seats .
HOLDEN: So it 's true ? !
ALYSSA: Yes Holden ! In fact , everything you heard or dug up on me was probably true ! Yeah , I took on two guys at once ! You want to hear some gems you might not have unearthed - I took a twenty six year old guy to my senio prom , and then left halfway through to have sex with him and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo ! And the girl who got caught in the shower with Miss Moffit , the gym teacher ? That was me ! Or how about in college , when I let Shannon Hamilton videotape us having sex - only to find out the next day that he broadcast it on the campus cable station ? ! They 're all true - those and so many more ! Did n't you know ? I 'm the queen of urban legend !
HOLDEN: How the hell could you do those things ? !
ALYSSA: Easily ! Some of it I did out of stupidity , some of it I did out of what I thought was love , but - good o ad - they were my choices , and I 'm not making apologies for them now - not to you or anyone ! And how dare you try to lay a guilt trip on me about it - in public , no less ! Who the fuck do you think you are , you judgemental prick ? !
HOLDEN: How am I supposed to feel about all of this ?
ALYSSA: How are you supposed to feel about it ? Feel what ever the fuck you want about it ! The only thing that really matters is how you feel about me .
HOLDEN: I do n't know how I feel about you now .
ALYSSA: Why ? Because I had some sex ?
HOLDEN: Some sex ?
ALYSSA: Yes , Holden - that 's all it was some sex ! Most of it stupid high school sex , for Christ 's sake ! Like you never had sex in high school !
HOLDEN: There 's a world of fucking difference etween typical high school sex and two guys at once ! They fucking used you ?
ALYSSA: I used them ! You do n't think I would 've let it happen if I had n't wanted it to , do you ? ! I was an experimental girl , for Christ 's sake ! Maybe you knew early on that you track was from point ' a ' to ' b ' - but unlike you I was n't given a fucking map at birth , so I tried it all ! That is until we - that 's you and I - got together , and suddenly , I was sated . Ca n't you take some fucking comfort in that ? You turned out to be all I was ever looking for - the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle ! Look I 'm sorry I let you believe that you were the only guy I 'd ever been with . I should 've been more honest . But it seemed to make you feel special in a way that me telling you over and over again how incredible you are would never get across .
HOLDEN: I want us to be something that we ca n't .
ALYSSA: And what 's that ?
HOLDEN: A normal couple .
BANKY: The girl ?
OC VOICE: Yo , look at this morose mother fucke here..
JAY: Smells like somebody shit in his cereal .
HOLDEN: What took you so long ?
JAY: We were at the mall . You bring the salad ?
HOLDEN: How 'd a dirt merchant like you eve learn about likeness rights ?
JAY: We deal to a lot of lawyers . Speaking of which Little signing bonus and shit !
HOLDEN: I 'll pass . Take a look at the issue .
JAY: Yeah . When you gon na get some pussy in that book , man ! Throw some super- villain in with big fucking tits that shoot milk or something , and I just drink her dry , bust some moves on her and then she has to fuck me . Fuck us .
HOLDEN: I 'll see what I can do . A WAITRESS joins them .
WAITRESS: What can I get you .
HOLDEN: Nothing , thanks .
JAY: Yo Flo - tell Mel to whip me up a toasted bagel and cream cheese . You want one too ? Make that two . And kiss my grits . Noonch . D'jever watch 'Alice ' ? That show 's good as hell . So why the long face , Horse ? Banky on the rag ?
HOLDEN: When is he not ? No - I 'm just having some girl trouble .
JAY: Bitch pressing charges ? I get that a lot .
HOLDEN: No . I 'm just at a point where I do n't know what to do .
JAY: Kick her to the curb . Girls get to be too much trouble , there 's always the 'band of the hand ' .
HOLDEN: Ca n't do it , g. I 'm in love .
JAY: Ah , there ai n't no such thing . You got ta boil it all down to the essentials . It 's like Cube says - life ai n't nothing but bitches and money .
HOLDEN: Just what I needed - advice from the 'hood
JAY: Who is this girl ?
HOLDEN: I do n't think you know her .
JAY: Come on man - I 'm people who know people .
HOLDEN: You sound like Barbra Streisand .
JAY: That 's 'cause I got this tubby bitch playing her greatest hits tape in my ear all the time . You should see him she starts singing 'You Do n't Bring Me Flowers ' , this faggot starts crying like a little girl with a skinned knee and shit . It 's embarrassing . I got the only muscle in the world with a weakness for ballads . You big fucking softie . So what 's this skirt 's name !
HOLDEN: I 'm telling you , you do n't know her .
JAY: I ai n't playing . Tell me her name , Mysterio .
HOLDEN: Alyssa Jones .
JAY: Finger Cuffs ? Holden rubs his eyes .
HOLDEN: She is . Or was . I do n't know . The Waitress returns with the order .
JAY: And you go out with her ? Shit , man - you 're a lucky dog . She bring othe chicks to bed with you , get a little of that filet o ' fish sammich going on ?
HOLDEN: It 's not like that .
JAY: Well what 's it like then ?
HOLDEN: Right now ? I do n't know . I love her . But she has a past
JAY: I 'll say . Stuffin ' two guys , eating chicks out . Yo - I heard one time , she had this dog
HOLDEN: Eat your fucking bagel already !
JAY: Look at this touchy mother fucke ight here . So , if you 're all in love with her , what 's the problem ?
HOLDEN: The problem is shit like that . It was one thing when it was just girls - that was weird enough . But now you throw guys into the mix - two guys at once , no less . All that experienceWhat am I supposed to think ?
JAY: You think good ; because now she 'll be all true blue and shit . The girl 's tasted life , yo . Now she 's settlin ' for your boring , funny-book-makin ' ass .
HOLDEN: Settling . That 's comforting , Jay . Thanks .
JAY: That 's what I 'm here for .
HOLDEN: I 'm lust having a problem with all of it I ca n't get it out of my head these visuals of her doing all this shit . And I do n't know why I ca n't let it go . Because I 'm crazy about her , you know ? I look at this girl , I see the future . I see kids . I see grand- kids .
JAY: You 're scaring me .
HOLDEN: I 'm scaring myself . Because I think so much of her , and then I ca n't get over shit like 'Finger Cuffs ' . I do n't know what I 'm doing .
BOB: You 're chasing Amy .
HOLDEN: What..what did you say ?
BOB: You 're chasing Amy .
JAY: What do you look so shocked for ? He does this all the time . Fat bastard thinks just because he never says anything , that it 'll have some huge impact when he does open his fucking mouth .
BOB: Why do n't you shut up ? Jesus ! Always yap , yap , yapping all the time . Give me a fucking headache . I went through something like what you 're going through . Years ago . Same kind of thing with a girl named Amy .
JAY: When ?
BOB: A couple of years ago .
JAY: What 'd she 'Live in Canada ' o something ? Why do n't I remember this ?
BOB: What you do n't know about me I can just about squeeze into the Grand fucking Canyon . Did you know I always wanted to be a dancer in Vegas ?
JAY: Just cell your fucking story so we can get out of here and smoke this .
BOB: So there 's me an Amy , and we 're all inseparable , right ? Just big time in love . And then about four months in , I ask about the ex-boyfriend . Dum move , I know , but you know how it is - you do n't really want to know , but you just have to stupid guy bullshit . Anyway she starts telling me all about him - how they dated for years , lived together , her mother likes me better , lah , blah , blah - and I 'm okay . But then she tells me that a couple times , he brought other people to bed with them - menage a tois , I believe it 's called . Now this just blows my mind . I mean , I 'm not used to that sort of thing , right ? I was raised Catholic .
JAY: Saint Shithead .
BOB: Do something . So I get weirded out , and just start lasting her , right ? This is the only way I can deal with it - by calling her a slut , and telling her that she was used - I mean , I 'm out for blood I want to hurt her - because I do n't know how to deal with what I 'm feeling . And I 'm like `` What the fuck is wrong with you ? '' and she 's telling me that it was that time , in that place , and she did n't do anything wrong , so she 's not gon na apologize . So I tell her it 's over , and I walk .
JAY: Fucking a .
BOB: No , idiot . It was a mistake . I was n't disgusted with her , I was afraid . At that moment , I felt small - like I 'd lacked experience , like I 'd never be on her level or never be enough for her or something . And what I did n't get was that she did n't care . She was n't looking fo that guy anymore . She was looking fo me . But by the time I realized this , it was too late , you know . She 'd moved on , and all I had to show for it was some foolish pride , which then gave way to regret . She was the girl , I know that now . But I pushed he away
JAY: Enough of this fucking melodrama . My advice - forget her , dude . There 's one woman in the world . One woman , with many faces . Get up , bitch We got ta book . We 're catching a bus to Chi-town .
HOLDEN: What 's there ?
JAY: Business , yo . How many more of those phat envelopes do we got coming to us ?
HOLDEN: I do n't know . I do n't know if the ook 's going to be around much longer .
JAY: Yeah ? Good . I 'll be glad as shit when it 's gone .
HOLDEN: Are you kidding me ? There 's millions of people out there that 'd love to see themselves in a comic book .
JAY: I know . I spend every fucking waking hour with one of them . But it ai n't like us at all - all slapsticky and shit - running around like dicks , saying What 's that shit you got me saying ?
HOLDEN: Snootchie-bootchies .
JAY: 'Snootchie-bootchies ' . Who talks like that ? That 's baby-talk . It 's a big world , g - but we 're bound to run into you again . Until then - keep your unit on you .
HOLDEN: I 'll try .
BOB: Do , or do not - there is no ay .
JAY: Knock it off ! Get your fat ass moving - we got a bus to catch . Jedi-bitch .
HOLDEN: I know you 're wondering why I asked you both here tonight , at the same time , knowing that we have shit to settle between us , separately .
BANKY: I just figured you wanted to kill two irds with one stone by telling her to fuck off with me here so you did n't have to go through the story again later on .
ALYSSA: Fuck you .
BANKY: Not even if you let me videotape it .
HOLDEN: Enough ! I 've been going through things , ove and over . And I dissected it all , and looked at it a thousand different ways . Banky - there 's friction etween us for the first time in ou lives . You hate me dating Alyssa and you want me to sign off on this M-TV thing .
BANKY: How perceptive .
HOLDEN: Alyssa - you and I hit a wall , because I do n't know how to deal with you past , I guess .
BANKY: That 's a nice way of putting it . I 'd have said the whole double-stuff thing
HOLDEN: I 'm only going to say it once shut up . Now - I know I 'm to blame one way o the other on both accounts . With you , Alyssa - it 's my fault because I feel inadequate . Because you 've had so much experience , had such a big life ; and my life 's been pretty small in comparison .
ALYSSA: That does n't matter to me
HOLDEN: Please . I have to get through this . And with you Banky - I know why you 're having such a hard time with Alyssa , and it 's something that 's been obvious forever , but I guess I just did n't acknowledge it . You 're in love with me .
BANKY: What ?
HOLDEN: You 're attracted to me . Just as , in a way , I 'm attracted to you . I mean , it makes sense - we 've been together so long , we have so much in common
BANKY: Well , I 've got to get home and catch the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5 ' , so I 'll be
HOLDEN: It 's something you 're going to have to deal with . Bank . You may very well e gay , which explains your homophobia and why you 're so jealous of Alyssa , and your sense of humor as well .
BANKY: Just 'cause a guy 's got a predilection coward dick jokes
HOLDEN: Bank . Stop . Deal with it . You 'll feel much better . He grabs a chair from the side of the room .
ALYSSA: Do n't .
HOLDEN: And when I did some serious soul- searching , it came at me from out of nowhere , and suddenly it all made sense - a calm came over me . I know what we have to do . And then you - Bank , you Alyssa , and I - all of us can finally be alright .
ALYSSA: Please do n't say it .
HOLDEN: We 've all got to have sex together .
BANKY: Sure .
HOLDEN: You know I need this . You know it 'll help . Alyssa looks at him , sadly .
ALYSSA: No .
HOLDEN: No ? I I thought you 'd be into this .
ALYSSA: You did ? What does that say about me ?
HOLDEN: But you 've you 've done stuff like this . This should be no big deal for you .
ALYSSA: You do n't want this . You really do n't want this . Trust me .
HOLDEN: I need this . This has to happen . Why ca n't you see that ? And how can you not ? What does that say about me ? You can take it from two guys whose names you can barely remember , but I ask you to share an experience like it - where it 's about intimacy - and you say no ?
ALYSSA: I ca n't . Holden moves to her side of the couch .
HOLDEN: You can . I 'll be there . And when it 's over , we 'll be the strongest we 've ever been because we got through some nasty shit together . And we 'll finally be on the same level together . And then there 'll be nothing we ca n't accomplish .
ALYSSA: Oh Holden . That time is over for me . I 've been there . I 've done it . And I did n't find what I was looking for in any of it . I found that in you - in us . Doing this wo n't help you forget about the things you 're hung up on . It 'll create more .
HOLDEN: No it wo n't . I thought about all of that .
ALYSSA: No , it will . Maybe you 'll see me differently from then on - maybe you 'll despise me for going along with it , once you 're in the moment . Maybe I 'll moan differently and then you 'll esent Banky , and become suspicious of us . Or you 'll alienate him because of it , and then grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of you friendship . Or what if- I sincerely doubt it , but what if - I saw something in Banky that I never saw efore , and fell in love with him and left you . I 've been down roads like this before ; many times . I know you feel doing this will broaden you horizons and give you experience . But I 've had those experiences on my own . I ca n't accompany you on your 's . I 'm past that now . Or maybe I just love you too much . And I feel hurt and let down that you 'd want to share me with anyone . Because I never wanted to share you Regardless I ca n't be a part of this . Or you . Not anymore I love you . I always will . Know that . She releases him , then slaps him .
FAN: Do you know how much it 's going fo these days ? One ten . You signing it will push that up even higher ,
BANKY: If you sell it , I want a kickback
FAN: I do n't know if this is true , but I heard once that there was going to be an animated series .
BANKY: There was going to be
FAN: What happened !
BANKY: You 're looking at it . No Chronic - no cartoon
FAN: That sucks man . That would 've been awesome .
BANKY: Tell me about it
FAN: Is that what happened to you and Holden McNeil ? You got into a fight over the rights or something ?
BANKY: It was a little more involved than that .
FAN: Whatever happened to him ?
BANKY: He quit the biz . I guess .
FAN: You guys do n't talk anymore ?
BANKY: No . Not really .
OC FAN: Probably should n't have killed off Chronic . Banky smiles to OC .
BANKY: Guess not . Some doors just should n't e opened .
OC FAN: You do n't need that guy , anyway . You do great stuff without him .
BANKY: You 're so right .
OC FAN: Well , keep up the good work , man . Love them dick jokes . Love 'em . See ya .
BXVKY: Yeah . Bye . Okay . Who 's next ?
ALYSSA: Thanks for reading it . The Woman stands and rubs her shoulders .
WOMAN: I 'm going to get a soda . You want anything ?
ALYSSA: I 'm fine , thanks ,
OC HOLDEN: It 's mine . Alyssa looks up sharply . Holden stands before her , smiling .
HOLDEN: I saved you one .
ALYSSA: Hi .
HOLDEN: Hi .
ALYSSA: How 've you been ?
HOLDEN: Good . Really good . Yourself ?
ALYSSA: Good New issue 's selling like crazy , fo some reason .
HOLDEN: Because it 's so good . I really liked it .

ALYSSA: Looks Like a very personal story .
HOLDEN: I finally had something personal to say . They look at each other for a beat
ALYSSA: Yeah . I mean , it can get ugly . I just saw this nun in line call this small child a cunt-rag .
HOLDEN: Read that , when you have a minute
ALYSSA: I will .
HOLDEN: I 'd like to hear your thoughts about it . If you get a chance , give me a call .
ALYSSA: Okay . They look at each other for a beat .

ROD: Maybe it wo n't stay in .
STACY: Maybe you better just drive me home .
ROD: Let me just ask you a serious question first .
STACY: What ?
ROD: Are n't you worried you could die a virgin ?
STACY: Yeah . I 'm extremely worried about that . It 's right up there with global warming .
ROD: On our way home , a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield . Terminate us instantly . We 'd neve experience what it means to make love .
STACY: If sheep do n't count .
ROD: That was n't me
STACY: I know . I 'm kidding you . Chill out .
ROD: Well I 'm trying to be real here and you 're mocking me .
STACY: I 'm sorry , but you 're not going to die a virgin Rod .
ROD: You 're being unfair .

BRENT: Two kids were found mutilated in the woods . Lock the doo after me .
DEPUTY: Her parents reported her missing about an hour ago .
BRENT: What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves , 'Think I 'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today ' ?
DEPUTY: The same type that decides to carve into her stomach .
CLASSMATE 1: Jody !
JODY: Hi .
CLASSMATE 2: Was Stacy raped ?
JODY: I dunno . My dad never came home last night .
MR. MARLISTON: No one understands what leads people to do irrational things . We only know that unpunished violence festers , then explodes . Jody sits down in the back .

BRENT: I just wanted to check that you were okay ?
JODY: I 'm fine . I 've just never had someone my age die before . It 's so weird .
BRENT: How well did you know Stacy and Rod ?
JODY: I 've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we were n't tight or anything .
BRENT: Had either of them broken up with someone recently ? Hurt someone ?
JODY: No . Those two were togethe efore Kenny and I started hanging out and that 's over , what , God a year now .
BRENT: I want you to head right home after school .
JODY: I will . Is that all ?
TOM: Could you tell Mr. Marliston we 'd like to see him .
JODY: SURE .
BRENT: Why 'd you send for Lenny Marliston ?
TOM: The kids adore him . They confide in him . His patchouli reeking rea might know if Stacy and Rod were eally virgins . Why did n't you ask Jody that ?
BRENT: She 's my daughter , Tom .
TOM: So ?
BRENT: So you just do n't point lank ask your teenage daughte about sex .

JODY: Do n't you want to talk to him ? You watch him eat everyday .
SANDY: I do n't watch him eat everyday .
JODY: You stare at him non-stop , like every lunch . Like this . Like most people stare at car accidents . Jody imitates Sandy .
SANDY: The seat behind him is open . Come on , I can eavesdrop too .
JODY: You eventually have to talk to him .
SANDY: Why ? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they 've been married for twenty years .
CINDY: Jody ! Jody starts toward her table .
SANDY: No ! That 's his table .
JODY: You 're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now .
CINDY: Did your dad question you this morning ?
JODY: Just a little .
BEN: Did he ask you if Stacy and Rod has ever exchanged odily fluids ?
JODY: No . Why ?
CINDY: He asked Marliston .
JODY: If they had ever gone all the way ?
BEN: Yeah . Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED
CINDY: I wonder why it 's so important to know if they fucked ?
BEN: What I do n't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin . They could have asked you Cindy .
CINDY: I never fucked Rod .
BEN: Exactly . Then he must be a virgin .
ANNETTE: You 're a shitsucking liar !
DYLAN: Better than being a 'cocksucking ' liar !
ANNETTE: Shut your face !
LEONARD: You can tell me all about it in my office . Calm down . We 're all on edge today . He guides her out .
SANDY: What 's up with that ? Mark opens a TWINKIE and starts to eat it .
MARK: Dylan 's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job .
SANDY: And she did n't ? Ben and Mark laugh .
BEN: There 's a better chance that he got head from all five Spice Girls .
SANDY: That 's horrible .
CINDY: I think it 's funny .
BEN: Me too . I 'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector .
JODY: You would n't ?
BEN: I would if Dylan paid me .
SANDY: What am I supposed to say ? 'Nice sweater Mark ' ? 'Did you uy it at Eddie Bauer 's ? '
JODY: You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his ack molars .
SANDY: You 're so fucking lucky you dad is the sheriff .
JODY: You are 'sp fucking ' wrong .
SANDY: You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton . Everyone wants to meet you . Party with you . Have sex with you .
JODY: But you ca n't do any of it . So it sucks . I always have to 'set an example ' . Jody stops , noticing something .
SANDY: He 's just trying to mess with your head . Ignore him .
JODY: Does she fuck ?
SANDY: I doubt it . Who 'd want to fuck her . She probably eeks worse than the docks down in those panties .
JODY: Mr. Jenkins called on me in class today . It was so embarrassing . I was seriously spaced . I 'd been thinking about Kenny for over twenty minutes . When I snapped out of it , I looked pathetic . I was teared up . Everyone was staring at me .
STACY: What did you say ?
JODY: That I was sorry . I 'd drifted off . That I 'd been thinking about Stacy and Rod .
SANDY: Oh nice save .
JODY: I was desperate . It was gross .
SANDY: Kenny 'll come running back . This is just his way of pressuring you .
JODY: He says he loves me .
SANDY: Personally I think he has a deep , almost pathological desire to corrupt you . But I suppose that 's a type of love .
JODY: Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out .
SANDY: No !
JODY: You 're the one always saying 'Just do it ' .
SANDY: That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you ' shit . I say fuck his best friend . Jody laughs .
JODY: I do n't know what I 'm so scared of .
SANDY: Want to come in for awhile ? Log onto AOL , flirt with some married men , head into a private S & M chat room . . .
JODY: How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you .

BRENT: I need to know how far you and Kenny went ?
JODY: What do you mean ?
BRENT: Well , I assume you let him kiss you ?
JODY: Well yeah . Of course . Everyone kisses .
BRENT: I 'm not criticizing . _ Did you two get any further ?
JODY: A little .
BRENT: How much further ?
JODY: Daddy ! I DO N'T THINK THIS IS

BRENT: You never went , uh , all the way ?
JOY: No . Brent nods , worried . He 's obviously upset .
BRENT: Ok .
JODY: Daddy , are you upset that I 'm still a virgin ? !

MARGE: Did you warn her ?
BRENT: No . Let her get at least one more peacefully night 's sleep .
TOM: Oh GOD Brent , is there anything you do n't feel guilty about ?
BRENT: is there anything you do ?
TOM: Focus on the present . You always want to change the past . Let 's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today , not what you should told them yesterday .
BRENT: I 'm going to tell them everything I know . I 'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m .
TOM: You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we 're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands .
BRENT: Better than a pile of dead teenagers .
FATHER 1: Well , what is it ?
BRENT: All three of the victims attended ou
MOTHER 1: So ?
MOTHER 2: You 're almost positive that 's who this monster is targeting ?
MOTHER 1: Virgins ?
BRENT: We found the word 'virgin ' written at both crime scenes .
FATHER 1: Why did n't you tell us this yesterday ?
BRENT: We did n't think this was a serial killer . We thought it was an isolated incident . This is all very upsetting to everyone .
MOTHER 3: Are you close to an arrest ?
BRENT: I ca n't say we are .
FATHER 2: What are we supposed to do ?
BRENT: What do you mean ?
MOTHER 2: What are we supposed to tell our kids ?
FATHER 2: To go out and get laid if they wan na feel safe ?
BRENT: I think that 's ' up to each and everyone of you .
FATHER 3: I ca n't lock my daughter in the basement .
FATHER 2: I would n't worry about it Victor . A few other parents laugh .
FATHER 3: What 's that supposed to mean ?
FATHER 2: Nothing .
FATHER 3: What are you saying about my daughter ?
FATHER 2: Calm down . I was joking . Father 3 pushes Father 2 .
FATHER 3: Hell of a time to be joking about a thing like that you sick bastard !

JODY: Not that many .
SANDY: You watch . There 's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow . Maybe I 'll finally talk to Mark Shale .
JODY: NO ? !
SANDY: Andy ! I 'm on the phone !
ANDY: I 'm willing to help save her life . Jody , if you want to come over right now . We could slip up into the attic fo a few minutes . There 's an old mattress up there

DEPUTY: We 're seeing all the signs in town .
BRENT: I like the idea of all the kids in one place . If it happens , just keep a man outside until you hear from me . I 'll be back in a couple of hours . He jumps in his car and speeds away .
MISS DUNLOP: Hi Jody . What can I DO for you ?
JODY: Hi Miss Dunlop . Where do you keep the old town papers ?
MISS DUNLOP: They 're all on microfiche . What year are you looking for ?
JODY: Twenty eight years ago .
MISS DUNLOP: Follow me .
JODY: This place is empty .
MISS DUNLOP: Everyone 's getting ready for the party .
JODY: You heard about that ?
MISS DUNLOP: Of course . NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY . Kids were whispering about it all day .
JODY: Do n't you think it 's sick ?
MISS DUNLOP: Not at all . In fact , I thought about going .
JODY: You Miss Dunlop ? She hands Jody the microfiche .
MISS DUNLOP: Unfortunately I qualify . Think I 'm too old ?
JODY: No .
MISS DUNLOP: You 're sweet . I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age . My life might have been very different .
JODY: Is that you Miss Dunlop ?
MARGE: I want you to come home with me right now , Jody .
JODY: Who is she ?
MARGE: She 's nobody you should be concerned with .
JODY: Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman , clothes and all . I think that concerns me .
MARGE: Do n't make me order you . Jody sits back down .
JODY: You going to drag me out and me in my oom until I go to college ?
MARGE: If I have to . Please let me protect you .
JODY: Wait .
MARGE: What ?
JODY: I 'm not leaving . I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out . Three of my classmates are dead . Mom does n't like this at all .
MARGE: Years ago , something horrible happened in this town . When I was still in high school . A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors .
JODY: Attacked how ?
MARGE: She was raped . At least that 's what she claimed .
JODY: You did n't believe her ?
MARGE: No , I believed her . She was in pretty bad shape . Inside and out . But the boys were never formally charged .
JODY: Why not ?
MARGE: They were children of our leading citizens , stars of the football team . And she was a loner . An angry girl that no one really liked . She 'd called them 'queers ' .
JODY: People thought these guys had a ight to rape her because she called them 'queers ' ?
MARGE: They were proving to her they were n't . They were very drunk . Things were different ack then . You think kids are sexually ottled up today .
JODY: And the police did nothing ?
JODY: How could you ?
MARGE: I do n't know . We just did . I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain . Against the whole town .
JODY: The word is Mob .
MARGE: I 've regretted it ever since . Never run with the herd just because they 're the herd .
JODY: Who were they ?
MARGE: Who ?
JODY: The men . Do any of them still live around here ?
MARGE: Two men left town right afte it happened .
JODY: You 're not telling me something .
MARGE: Mr. Sisler was one of them .
JODY: The principal ?
MARGE: Yes .
JODY: Who was the fourth ? Marge is stricken . She looks down .
MARGE: God . It 's like everything that was ever repressed in this town is suddenly ubbling up through the ground . Jody gets it .
JODY: Dad ? Her mother ca n't deny it any longer .
JODY CONT'D: THAT 'S why he called Mr. Sisler first . He was one of them .
MARGE: Not a day has gone by where you father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened . We both have
JODY: NO !
MARGE: He dedicated his life to law enforcement after Jody runs off , very upset .
CARETAKER: Hello ?
BRENT: I 'm looking for Lisa Sherman .
CARETAKER: She 's not here .
BRENT: You know where I can find her ?
CARETAKER: St. Michael 's .
BRENT: She works at a church ?
CARETAKER: She resides there . Out back . She died a year and a half ago .
BRENT: Of what ?
CARETAKER: A bullet to the right cerebellum .
BRENT: She was murdered ?
CARETAKER: No . She ate a pistol for lunch one day . Brent ca n't help but feel responsible .
BRENT: Can you describe her ? How old was she ?
CARETAKER: I never met the woman . I 'm just taking care of the place until they sell it .
BRENT: Can you get inside ?
CARETAKER: I can .
BRENT: I knew Lisa Sherman long ago . It 's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it 's the same woman who lived here .
CARETAKER: I do n't give a fuck what your reasons
KENNY: Jody ! Yes ! You 're here .
KENNT CONT'D: What 's the matter ?
BRENT: Is there a picture of her somewhere ?
CARETAKER: No pictures . No mirrors . Was she a crazy woman when you knew her ?
BRENT: No .
CARETAKER: Could n't tell she going to off herself , huh ?
BRENT: No , you could n't .
CARETAKER: I 've been in a lot of people 's houses and this one 's the creepiest .
BRENT: Really ?
CARETAKER: Yeah . You should check downstairs .
BRENT: Why ?
CARETAKER: People always keep their secrets in thei attics or in their basements . All the weirdness in this house took place in the asement .
KENNY: All our parents are weirdoes . I think my dad is into hookers . I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid .
JODY: My dad acts like he 's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he 's really Johnny Fucking Rapist .
KENNY: I think this is a big part of growing up . It 's losing your spiritual virginity . It 's when you finally discover that you parents are n't anything they told you they were . They 're even bigger hypocrites than your friends .
JODY: I ca n't believe I listened to one word of his shit .
KENNY: But if he 'd been sent to jail , there would be no Jody .
JODY: So I should feel happy that he got away with it ?
KENNY: I do n't know . I kind of am .
JODY: Let 's just start a party right here , ight fucking now .
BRENT: Tom ? Lisa Sherman is dead . But you 'll never believe what I found out . Meet me at the Roadhouse on Route nine in a half hour . We need to talk in private .
JODY: What 's wrong ? Am I doing something wrong ?
KENNY: Just making me feel like a piece of meat .
JODY: I 'm making you feel like meat ?
KENNY: Yeah .
JODY: You break up with me because I wo n't fuck you .
KENNY: That 's not why we broke up .
JODY: You flaunt some slut in my face .
KENNY: Sharon 's far from a slut .
JODY: And when I finally agree to spread my legs , you accuse me of treating you like meat .
KENNY: Jody , you 're only doing this to get back at your dad . It does n't have that much to do with me .
JODY: This party is sick . She heads to the door .
KENNY: Jody . Wait .
JODY: What ?
KENNY: I 'm scared . Three kids are dead . I want to go to this party .
JODY: Then go to the party . Run with the herd Kenny . Just do n't spew out all that 'be an individual , assert yourself ' crap anymore . She heads out , very upset .
DAD: I know where you 're going .
DAD: Your brother told us .
SANDY: Daddy .
DAD: Shh . I 'm not going to tell you not to go .
SANDY: You 're not ?
DAD: No . I could n't do that . I have something for you .

CAR OWNER: Are you sure ?
JODY: Yes .
LEONARD: My house is just a couple of blocks away . Why do n't you come on over and clean those cuts up .

JODY: Sure .
LEONARD: You are n't going to the party ?
JODY: You know about that too ?
LEONARD: of COURSE . You 're not scared ?
JODY: Of course I 'm scared .
LEONARD: Then you should go .
JODY: You think I should go to the party , Mr. Marliston ?
LEONARD: I really do . For your own safety .
JODY: I just feel so manipulated . By everyone . My dad , my boyfriend , and now some psychopath I do n't even know .
LEONARD: We 're all manipulated . From the moment
JODY: Really ?
LEONARD: Yes . We have no real freedom . You of all people should understand that . This may sting .
JODY: Me ? Why me ?
LEONARD: Because of your father . The way what his sins shaped you .
JODY: What do you know about my father ?
LEONARD: He 's a rapist . Like mine . She grimaces . The disinfectant hurts .
JODY: _ Your father raped someone ?
LEONARD: Lisa Sherman was my mother . Do you know who that is ?

JODY: You 're the killed .
LEONARD: Yes that 's the whole point . This is what I was put on this earth to do . Rape the town that raped my mother . Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers . I 've planned this since I was a very little boy . You have no real freedom either . Your father has cast a shadow that you 've never eluded .

SHARON: You ok ?
KENNY: Just thinking about something .
SHARON: What ?
KENNY: There 's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday . It could be really dangerous for them if the killer is n't caught .
SHARON: I guess so . Luckily we wo n't have that problem .
KENNY: I got to go .
SHARON: What ?
KENNY: I 'm worried about someone . He puts his clothes on .
SHARON: You ca n't just leave me here .
BOY'S VOICE: Stay put Sharon . I 'll hop on ove when I 'm done here .

CURLY'S VOICE: Oh , no .
GITTES: All right , enough is enough . You ca n't eat the Venetian blinds , Curly . I just had 'em installed on Wednesday .
CURLY: She 's just no good .
GITTES: What can I tell you , Kid ? You 're ight . When you 're right , you 're ight , and you 're right .
CURLY: Ai n't worth thinking about . Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly .
GITTES: You 're absolutely right , I would n't give her another thought .
CURLY: You know , you 're okay , Mr. Gittes . I know it 's your job , but you 're okay .
GITTES: Thanks , Curly . Call me Jake .
CURLY: Thanks . You know something , Jake ?
GITTES: What 's that , Curly ?
CURLY: I think I 'll kill her .
WOMAN: I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to this personally .
WALSH: If you 'll allow us to complete ou preliminary questioning , by then he 'll be free .
CURLY: They do n't kill a guy for that .
GITTES: Oh they do n't ?
CURLY: Not for your wife . That 's the unwritten law .
GITTES: I 'll tell you the unwritten law , you dumb son of a bitch , you got ta be ich to kill somebody , anybody and get away with it . You think you got that kind of dough , you think you got that kind of class ? Curly shrinks back a little .
CURLY: No
GITTES: You bet your ass you do n't . You ca n't even pay me off . This seems to upset Curly even more .
CURLY: I 'll pay the rest next trip . We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict . We hit a chubasco , they do n't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore .
GITTES: Forget it . I only mention it to illustrate a point
CURLY: Thanks , Mr. Gittes .
GITTES: Call me Jake . Careful driving home , Curly .
SOPHIE: A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for you , with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy . Gittes nods , walks on in .
WALSH: Mrs. Mulwray , may I present Mr. Gittes ?
GITTES: How do you do , Mrs. Mulwray ?
MRS. MULWRAY: Mr. Gittes
GITTES: Now , Mrs. Mulwray , what seems to be the problem ?
MRS. MULWRAY: My husband , I believe , is seeing another woman .
GITTES: No , really ?
MRS. MULWRAY: I 'm afraid so .
GITTES: I am sorry .
MRS. MULWRAY: Ca n't we talk about this alone , Mr. Gittes ?
GITTES: I 'm afraid not , Mrs. Mulwray . These men are my operatives and at some point they 're going to assist me . I ca n't do everything myself .
MRS. MULWRAY: Of course not .
GITTES: Now , what makes you certain he is involved with someone ?
MRS. MULWRAY: A wife can tell . Gittes sighs .
GITTES: Mrs. Mulwray , do you love you husband ?
MRS. MULWRAY: Yes of course .
GITTES: Then go home and forget about it .
MRS. MULWRAY: But
GITTES: I 'm sure he loves you , too . You know the expression , let sleeping dogs lie ? You 're better off not knowing .
MRS. MULWRAY: But I have to know .
GITTES: All right , what 's your husband 's first name ?
MRS. MULWRAY: Hollis . Hollis Mulwray .
GITTES: Water and Power ?
MRS. MULWRAY: He 's the Chief Engineer .
DUFFY: Chief Engineer ?
GITTES: This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook , Mrs. Mulwray . It takes time .
MRS. MULWRAY: Money does n't matter to me , Mr. Gittes . Gittes sighs .
GITTES: Very well . We 'll see what we can do .
BAGBY: Gentlemen , today you can walk out that door , turn right , hop on a streetcar and in twenty-five minutes end up smack in the Pacific Ocean . Now you can swim in it , you can fish in it , you can sail in it but you ca n't drink it , you ca n't water you lawns with it , you ca n't irrigate an orange grove with it . Remember we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert . Los Angeles is a desert community . Beneath this building , beneath every street there 's a desert . Without water the dust will rise up and cove us as though we 'd never existed !
COUNCILMAN: Mayor Bagby let 's hear from the departments again . I suppose we bette take Water and Power first . Mr. Mulwray .
COUNCIL PRESIDENT: What in the hell do you think you 're doing ? Get those goddam things out of here !
FARMER: Tell me where to take them ! You do n't have an answer for that so quick , do you ?
SOPHIE: He 's in the dark room .
GITTES: Where 'd he go yesterday ?
WALSH'S VOICE: Three reservoirs . Men 's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower , and the Pig ' n Whistle .
GITTES: Jesus Christ , this guy 's really got water on the brain .
WALSH'S VOICE: What 'd you expect ? That 's his job .
GITTES: Listen , we ca n't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something .
WALSH'S VOICE: I think I got something .
GITTES: Oh yeah ? You pick up the watch ?
WALSH'S VOICE: It 's on your desk . Say , you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins ? Gittes walks to his office .
GITTES: He was there all night .
WALSH: They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig ' n Whistle .
GITTES: What about ?
WALSH: I do n't know . The traffic was pretty loud . I only heard one thing – apple core .
GITTES: Apple core ?
WALSH: Yeah .
GITTES: Jesus Christ , Walsh . That 's what you spent your day doing ?
WALSH: Look , you tell me to take pictures , I take pictures .
GITTES: Let me explain something to you , Walsh . This business requires a certain finesse .
BARNEY: When you get so much publicity , afte a while you must get blasé about it . A self-satisfied smile comes to Gittes ' face .
GITTES: Look at that .
BARNEY: Heat 's murder .
OTHER CUSTOMER: Fools names and fools faces Gittes has heard the word . He straightens up .
GITTES: What 's that , pal ?
OTHER CUSTOMER: Nothing . You got a hell of a way to make a living .
GITTES: Oh ? What do you do to make ends meet ?
OTHER CUSTOMER: Mortgage Department , First National Bank . Gittes laughs .
GITTES: Tell me , how many people a week do you foreclose on ?
OTHER CUSTOMER: We do n't publish a record in the paper , I can tell you that .
GITTES: Neither do I .
OTHER CUSTOMER: No , you have a press agent do it .
GITTES: Barney , who is this bimbo ? He a egular customer ?
BARNEY: Take it easy , Jake .
GITTES: Look , pal . I make an honest living . People do n't come to me unless they 're miserable and I help 'em out of a ad situation . I do n't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank .
BARNEY: Jake , for Christ 's sake . Gittes is trying to take off his sheet .
GITTES: C'mon , get out of the barber chair . We 'll go outside and talk this over .
BARNEY: Hey , c'mon , Jake . Sit down . Sit down . You hear about the fella goes to his friend and says , 'What 'll I do , I 'm tired of screwing my wife ? ' and his friend says , 'Why n't you do what the Chinese do ? '
GITTES: I do n't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick . I make an honest living .
BARNEY: 'Course you do , Jake .
GITTES: An honest living .
BARNEY: So anyway , he says , 'why n't you do what the Chinese do ? '
GITTES: Duffy , Walsh .
SOPHIE: But , Mr. Gittes .
GITTES: Sophie .
SOPHIE: Yes , Mr. Gittes . She gets up and leaves .
GITTES: So there 's this fella who 's tired of screwing his wife .
DUFFY: Jake , listen .
GITTES: Shut up , Duffy , you 're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do ? So he says what do they do ? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while . Just listen a second , Duffy
YOUNG WOMAN: Mr. Gittes ?
GITTES: Yes ?
YOUNG WOMAN: Do you know me ?
GITTES: Well I think I I would 've emembered .
YOUNG WOMAN: Have we ever met ?
GITTES: Well , no .
YOUNG WOMAN: Never ?
GITTES: Never .
YOUNG WOMAN: That 's what I thought . You see , I 'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray . You know , Mr. Mulwray 's wife .
GITTES: Not that Mulwray ?
EVELYN: Yes , that Mulwray , Mr. Gittes . And since you agree with me we 've neve met , you must also agree that I have n't hired you to do anything . Certainly not spy on my husband . I see you like publicity , Mr. Gittes . Well , you 're going to get it .
GITTES: Now wait a minute , Mrs. Mulwray
EVELYN: I do n't get tough with anybody , Mr. Gittes . My lawyer does .
GITTES: There 's seven ashtrays in this room , Duffy .
DUFFY: Okay .
GITTES: That 's a filthy habit .
DUFFY: I said okay , Jake .
GITTES: Yeah , yeah . If she 'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you 'd say okay to that , too .
WALSH: Look , Jake . She gave us Mulwray 's eal phone number and address .
GITTES: All she needed for that was the phone ook !
WALSH: No , no . She said not to call , he husband might answer .
GITTES: When I find out who that phony bitch was .
SOPHIE: Yes , Mr. Gittes .
GITTES: Get me the Times . Whitey Mehrholtz . And how about that snotty broad ? What does she think , she 's perfect ? Coming in waving her lawyers and he money at me – so goddam smug . She 's no better than anybody else in this town . Sophie BUZZES .
WALSH: So he says you sent them ?
GITTES: They 're all a bunch of phonies .
SECRETARY: He 's not in , Mr. ?
GITTES: Gittes .
SECRETARY: May I ask what this is regarding ?
GITTES: It 's personal . Has he been out long ?
SECRETARY: Since lunch .
GITTES: Gee whiz . And I 'm late .
SECRETARY: He was expecting you ?
GITTES: Fifteen minutes ago . Why do n't I go in and wait ?
YELBURTON: Can I help you ? Russ Yelburton , Deputy Chief in the Department .
GITTES: J.J. Gittes . And it 's not a departmental matter .
YELBURTON: I wonder if you 'd care to wait in my office ?
GITTES: And Mulwray is n't ?
YELBURTON: He never even kids about it .
GITTES: Maybe he takes it very seriously .
YELBURTON: I 'm sorry , I
GITTES: Well , tell him I 'll be back . Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton 's desk .
YELBURTON: Help yourself .
GITTES: Mulvihlll , what are you doing here ?
MULVIHILL: They shut my water off , what 's it to you ?
GITTES: How 'd you find out ? You do n't drink it , you do n't take a bath in it , maybe they sent you a letter . Ah , ut then you 'd have to be able to ead .
YELBURTON: Hope so . He 's working for us .
GITTES: J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray .
GARDENER: Bad for glass .
GITTES: Yeah sure . Bad for glass .
EVELYN: Yes , Mr. Gittes ?
GITTES: Actually , I 'm here to see you husband , Mrs. Mulwray .
EVELYN: Would you like something to drink ?
GITTES: What are you having ?
EVELYN: Iced tea .
GITTES: Yeah . Fine , thank you . Chinese Butler nods , disappears
EVELYN: My husband 's at the office .
GITTES: Actually he 's not . And he 's moved from his apartment at the El Macando .
EVELYN: That 's not his apartment .
GITTES: Anyway I the point is , Mrs. Mulwray . I 'm not in business to be loved , but I am in business , and elieve me , whoever set up you husband , set me up . L.A. 's a small town , people talk . He waits for a response . Then
EVELYN: Mr. Gittes , you 've talked me into it . I 'll drop the lawsuit .
GITTES: What ?
EVELYN: I said I 'll drop it .
GITTES: Mrs. Mulwray ?
EVELYN: Yes , Mr. Gittes ?
GITTES: I do n't want to drop it .
EVELYN: Why ? What on earth for ? Look , Hollis seems to think you 're an innocent man .
GITTES: Well , I 've been accused of many things , Mrs. Mulwray , but never that .
EVELYN: What do you mean ?
GITTES: May I speak frankly , Mrs. Mulwray ?
EVELYN: You may if you can , Mr. Gittes .
GITTES: Well , that little girlfriend , she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course . She 's disappeared . Maybe they disappeared togethe somewhere .
EVELYN: Suppose they did . How does it concern you ?
GITTES: Nothing personal , Mrs. Mulwray , I just
EVELYN: It 's very personal . It could n't be more personal . Is this a business o an obsession with you ?
GITTES: Look at it this way . Now this phony oad , excuse the language , says she 's you , she 's hired me . Whoeve put her up to it , did n't have anything against me . They were out to get your husband . Now if I see him , I can help him . Did you talk this morning ?
EVELYN: No . I went riding rather early .
GITTES: Looks like you went quite a distance .
EVELYN: No , Just riding bareback , that 's all . Anyway , you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs . Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them . Otherwise he 'll be home y 6 30 .
GITTES: I 'll stop by .
EVELYN: Please call first . Gittes nods .
GUARD: Sorry , this is closed to the public , sir . Gittes hesitates only a moment , then
GITTES: It 's all right . Russ Yelburton , Deputy Chief in the Department .
GUARD: Sorry , Mr. Yelburton . Go on down .
LOACH: Gittes , for Chrissakes .
GITTES: Loach .
LOACH: C'mon , get out of here before

ESCOBAR: Hello , Jake .
GITTES: How are you , Lou ?
ESCOBAR: I have a cold I ca n't seem to shake ut other than that , I 'm fine .
GITTES: Summer colds are the worst .
ESCOBAR: Yeah , they are .
A FIREMAN: No smoking , sir . It 's a fire hazard this time of year .
ESCOBAR: I think we can make an exception . I 'll see he 's careful with the matches .
GITTES: Thanks , Lou .
ESCOBAR: How 'd you get past the guards ?
GITTES: Well , to tell you the truth , I lied a little .
ESCOBAR: You 've done well by yourself .
GITTES: I get by .
ESCOBAR: Well , sometimes it takes a while fo a man to find himself and I guess you have .
LOACH: Poking around in other people 's dirty linen .
GITTES: Yeah . Tell me , you still throw Chinamen into jail for spitting on the laundry ?
ESCOBAR: You 're behind the times , Jake . They 've got steam irons now . And I 'm out of Chinatown .
GITTES: Since when ?
ESCOBAR: Since I made Lieutenant .
GITTES: Congratulations .
ESCOBAR: Uh-huh . So what are you doing here ?
GITTES: Looking for someone .
ESCOBAR: Who ?
GITTES: Hollis Mulwray . You seen him ?
ESCOBAR: Oh yes .
GITTES: I 'd like to talk to him .
ESCOBAR: You 're welcome to try . There he is .
EVELYN: Of course .
ESCOBAR: Obviously the fall must have knocked him out .
EVELYN: Well , it did n't make him happy
ESCOBAR: But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life ?
EVELYN: No .
ESCOBAR: Mrs. Mulwray , do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question ? Evelyn shows a flash of annoyance .
EVELYN: No .
ESCOBAR: Do you know where she might be ?
EVELYN: Certainly not !
ESCOBAR: You and your husband never discussed her ?
EVELYN: He we did he would n't tell me her name . We quarreled over her of course . It came as a complete surprise to me .
ESCOBAR: A complete surprise ?
EVELYN: Yes .
ESCOBAR: But I thought you 'd hired a private investigator .
EVELYN: A private investigator ?
ESCOBAR: Mr. Gittes .
EVELYN: Well yes .
ESCOBAR: And when did Mr. Gittes inform you that these rumors had some foundation in fact ?
GITTES: Just before the story broke in the papers , Lou .
ESCOBAR: You would n't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman .
GITTES: No .
ESCOBAR: Or her name ?
GITTES: No .
EVELYN: Will you need me for anything else , Lieutenant ?
ESCOBAR: I do n't think so , Mrs. Mulwray . Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information , we 'll be in touch .
GITTES: I 'll walk her to her car , be right ack .
GITTES: Mrs. Mulwray ? Mrs. Mulwray .
EVELYN: Just a minute
GITTES: You left your keys in the ignition .
EVELYN: Oh thank you .
GITTES: A check ? Evelyn gets in her car .
EVELYN: To make it official , I hired you . She drives off , leaving Gittes gaping .
GITTES: Do n't give me that , Lou . You hauled me down here for a statement . Escobar shrugs .
ESCOBAR: I do n't want it anymore .
GITTES: No ?
ESCOBAR: No . It was an accident .
GITTES: You mean that 's what you 're going to call it . Escobar looks up .
ESCOBAR: That 's right . Out of respect for his civic position . Resume walking . Gittes laughs .
GITTES: What 'd he do , Lou , make a pass at your sister ? Escobar stops .
ESCOBAR: No , he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people . But they were n't very important , just a unch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam . Now beat it , Gittes , you do n't come out of this smelling like a ose , you know .
GITTES: Oh yeah ? Can you think of something to charge me with ?
ESCOBAR: When I do , you 'll hear about it . Gittes nods , turns , and walks down the hall .
MORTY: Jake , what 're you doin ' here ?
GITTES: Nothin ' , Morty , it 's my lunch hour , I thought I 'd drop by and see who died lately .
MORTY: Yeah ? Ai n't that something ? Middle of a drought , the water commissione drowns . Only in L.A .
GITTES: Yeah . Banged up pretty bad .
MORTY: That 's a long fall .
GITTES: So how are you , Morty ?
MORTY: Never better . You know me , Jake .
GITTES: Yeah , so who you got there ? Morty pulls back the sheet .
MORTY: Leroy Shuhardt , local drunk used to hang around Ferguson 's Alley .
GITTES: Yeah .
MORTY: Drowned , too . This stops Gittes .
GITTES: Come again ?
MORTY: Yeah , got dead drunk , passed out in the bottom of the riverbed .
GITTES: The L.A. River ?
MORTY: Yeah , under Hollenbeck Bridge , what 's wrong with that ?
GITTES: It 's bone dry , Morty .
MORTY: It 's not completely dry .
GITTES: Yeah , well he ai n't gon na drown in a damp riverbed either , I do n't care how soused he was . That 's like drowning in a teaspoon . Morty shrugs .
MORTY: We got water out of him , Jake . He drowned . Gittes walks away mumbling .
GITTES: Jesus , this town
THE BOY: Si .
GITTES: Did n't you talk to a man here few days ago wore glasses he The Boy nods .
THE BOY: The water .
GITTES: What about the water ?
THE BOY: When it comes .
GITTES: When it comes ? What 'd you tell him ?
THE BOY: Comes in different parts of the river . Every night a different part .
GITTES: Goddam Florsheim shoe , goddammit .
SMALLER MAN: Hold it there , kitty cat .
MULVIHILL: Tell him you understand , Gittes .
GITTES: I understand
GITTES: Yeah , Sophie .
SOPHIE'S VOICE: A Miss Sessions calling .
GITTES: Who ?
SOPHIE'S VOICE: Ida Sessions .
GITTES: Do n't know her . Take a number .
WALSH: So some contractor wants to build a dam and he makes a few payoffs . So what ?
GITTES: I do n't want Mulvihill . I want the ig boys that are making the payoffs .
DUFFY: Then what 'll you do ?
GITTES: Sue the shit out of 'em .
WALSH: Yeah ?
GITTES: Yeah . What 's wrong with you guys ? Think ahead . We find 'em , sue 'em . We 'll make a killing . We 'll have dinner at Chasen 's twice a week , we 'll be pissing on ice the est of our lives .
WALSH: Sue people like that they 're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who 's trying the suit .
SOPHIE'S VOICE: Miss Ida Sessions again . She says you know her .
GITTES: Okay .
IDA'S VOICE: Oh yes we have are you alone , Mr. Gittes ?
GITTES: Is n't everybody ? What can I do fo you , Miss Sessions ?
IDA'S VOICE: Well , I 'm a working girl , Mr. Gittes . I did n't come in to see you on my own .
GITTES: When did you come in ?
IDA'S VOICE: I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray , remember ?
GITTES: Shut the fuck up ! Yes I remember nothing , Miss Sessions , just going over a detail or two with my associates you were saying ?
IDA'S VOICE: Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray , the point is if it eve comes out I want somebody to know I did n't know what would happen .
GITTES: I understand if you could tell me who employed you , Miss Sessions . That could help us both .
IDA'S VOICE: Oh no .
GITTES: Why do n't you give me your address and we can talk this over ?
IDA'S VOICE: No , Mr. Gittes . Just look in the obituary column of today 's Times
GITTES: The obituary column ?
IDA'S VOICE: You 'll find one of those people .
GITTES: 'Those people ? ' Miss Sessions . She hangs up . Gittes looks to his two men .
EVELYN: Tom Collins with lime , not lemon , please .
GITTES: I got your check in the mall .
EVELYN: Yes . As I said , I was very grateful . Gittes ' fingers the envelope . He coughs .
GITTES: Mrs. Mulwray , I 'm afraid that 's not good enough .
EVELYN: Well , how much would you like ?
GITTES: Stop it . The money 's fine . It 's generous but you 've shortchanged me on the story .
EVELYN: I have ?
GITTES: I think so . Something besides you husband 's death was bothering you . You were upset but not that upset .
EVELYN: Mr. Gittes Do n't tell me how I feel . The drinks come . The waiter sets them down .
GITTES: Sorry . Look , you sue me , your husband dies , you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato , and all of it quicke than wind from a duck 's ass . Excuse me . Then you ask me to lie to the police .
EVELYN: It was n't much of a lie .
GITTES: If your husband was killed it was . This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence .
EVELYN: But he was n't killed . Gittes smiles .
GITTES: I think you 're hiding something , Mrs. Mulwray . Evelyn remains unperturbed .
EVELYN: Well , I suppose I am actually I knew about the affair .
GITTES: How did you find out ?
EVELYN: My husband .
GITTES: He told you ? Evelyn nods .
EVELYN: I was grateful .
GITTES: You 'll have to explain that , Mrs. Mulwray .
EVELYN: Why ?
GITTES: Look , I do matrimonial work , It 's my metiay . When a wife tells me she 's happy her husband is cheating on he it runs contrary to my experience . Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn .
EVELYN: Unless what ?
GITTES: She 's cheating on him . Evelyn does n't reply .
EVELYN: I do n't like the word 'cheat . '
GITTES: Did you have affairs ?
EVELYN: Mr. Gittes .
GITTES: Did he know ?
EVELYN: Well I would n't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone , if that 's what you mean .
GITTES: Where you were when your husband died .
EVELYN: I ca n't tell you .
GITTES: You mean you do n't know where you were ?
EVELYN: I mean I ca n't tell you .
GITTES: You were seeing someone , too .
EVELYN: I do n't see anyone for very long , Mr. Gittes . It 's difficult for me . Now I think you know all you need to about me . I did n't want publicity . I did n't want to go into any of this , then or now . Is this all ? Gittes nods .
GITTES: Oh , by the way . What 's the ' C ' stand for ? He 's been fingering the envelope
EVELYN: K Cross .
GITTES: That your maiden name ?
EVELYN: Yes why ?
GITTES: No reason . Evelyn turns into Gittes .
EVELYN: You must 've had a reason to ask me that .
GITTES: No . I 'm just a snoop .
EVELYN: You seem to have had a reason fo every other question .
GITTES: No , not for that one .
EVELYN: I do n't believe you . Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn .
GITTES: Do me a favor . Sit still and act like I 'm charming . Evelyn involuntarily draws back .
EVELYN: How did it happen ?
GITTES: Been meaning to talk to you about that .
EVELYN: Maybe putting your nose in othe people 's business ?
GITTES: More like other people putting thei usiness in my nose . Evelyn actually smiles a little .
WOMAN'S VOICE: You son of a bitch . Gittes looks up and flashes his smile .
GITTES: Mrs . Match . How 're you ?
MRS. MATCH: Do n't give me that , you son of a itch .
GITTES: Okay . Gittes turns back to Evelyn .
EVELYN: Another satisfied client ?
GITTES: Another satisfied client 's wife .
MRS. MATCH: Look at me , you son of a bitch . You you bastard . Are you happy , are you happy now ?
GITTES: Sweaty ?
EVELYN: Tough guy , huh ? Gittes looks , sees she 's kidding , and nods .
GITTES: Wait a minute , sonny . I think you better come with me .
EVELYN: What for ? There 's nothing more to say . Get my car , please .
GITTES: Okay , go home . But in case you 're interested your husband was murdered . Somebody 's dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when we 're supposedly in the middle of a drought , he found out , and he was killed . There 's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue . Involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they do n't . It looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up , which is fine with me . But , Mrs. Mulwray . I goddam near lost my nose ! And I like it . I like breathing through it . And I still think you 're hiding something .
EVELYN: Mr. Gittes .
GITTES: J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton .
SECRETARY: Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time .
GITTES: Well I 'm on my lunch hour . I 'll wait .
SECRETARY: He 's liable to be tied up indefinitely .
GITTES: I take a long lunch . All day sometimes .
SECRETARY: Yes . No .
GITTES: He did or he did n't ?
SECRETARY: He owned it . Gittes is genuinely surprised at this .
GITTES: He owned the water department ?
SECRETARY: Yes .
GITTES: He owned the entire water supply fo the city ?
SECRETARY: Yes .
GITTES: How did they get it away from him ?
SECRETARY: Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display . The water . If you 'll just read the display .
GITTES: Mulwray ? I thought you said Cross owned the department .
SECRETARY: Along with Mr. Mulwray .
GITTES: They were partners .
SECRETARY: Yes . Yes , they were partners .
YELBURTON: Mr. Gittes , sorry to keep you waiting . These staff meetings , they just go on and on .
GITTES: Yeah , must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances .
YELBURTON: Oh yes . Hollis was the best department head the city 's ever had . My goodness , what happened to your nose ?
GITTES: I cut myself shaving .
YELBURTON: You ought to be more careful . That must really smart .
GITTES: Only when I breathe .
YELBURTON: Only when you breathe do n't tell me you 're still working for Mrs. Mulwray ?
GITTES: I never was .
YELBURTON: I do n't understand .
GITTES: Neither do I , actually . But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me .
YELBURTON: Mr. Gittes , you 're not making a bit of sense .
GITTES: Well , look at it this way , Mr. Yelburton . Mulwray did n't want to uild a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around , so . you decided to ruin it . Then he found out that you were dumping water every night . Then he was drowned .
YELBURTON: Mr. Gittes ! That 's an outrageous accusation . I do n't know what you 're talking about .
GITTES: Well , Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will . Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought . That 's news . Gittes heads toward the door .
YELBURTON: Wait . Please sit down , Mr. Gittes . We 're well , we 're not anxious fo this to get around , but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley . As you know , the farmers there have no legal right to our water , and since the drought we 've had to cut them off . The city comes first , naturally . But , well , we 've been trying to help some of them out , keep them from going under . Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff .
GITTES: Yeah , a little runoff . Where are those orchards ?
YELBURTON: I said , the northwest valley .
GITTES: That 's like saying they 're in Arizona .
YELBURTON: Mr. Gittes , my field men are out and I ca n't give you an exact location Gittes nods .
GITTES: You 're a married man , am I right ?
YELBURTON: Yes
GITTES: Hard working , have a wife and kids
YELBURTON: Yes
GITTES: I do n't want to nail you . I just want to know who put you up to it . I 'll give you a few days to think it over . Call me . I can help . Who knows ? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years . Gittes smiles , leaves an unsmiling Yelburton .
EVELYN: What 's your usual salary ?
GITTES: Thirty-five bucks daily for me , twenty for each of my operators , plus expenses , plus my fee if I show esults .
EVELYN: Whoever 's behind my husband 's death , why have they gone to all this trouble ?
GITTES: Money . How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs , that I do n't know .
EVELYN: I 'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved . Gittes buzzes Sophie .
GITTES: Sophie , draw up one of our standard forms for Mrs. Mulwray . Tell me , did you get married before or after Mulwray and your fathe sold the water department ? Evelyn nearly jumps at the question .
EVELYN: Yes , of course . It was quite a while after . I was just out of grade school when they did that .
GITTES: So you married your father 's business partner ? Evelyn nods . She lights another cigarette .
EVELYN: Oh . She quickly stubs one out .
GITTES: Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father ?
EVELYN: No ! Yes , a little . You see Hollis and my fa my father had a falling out
GITTES: Over the water department , or ove you ?
EVELYN: Not over me . Why would they have a falling out over me ?
GITTES: Then it was over the water department .
EVELYN: Not exactly . Well , I mean , yes . Yes and no . Hollis felt the public should own the water but I do n't think my father felt that way . Actually , it was over the Van der Lip . The dam that broke .
GITTES: Oh , yeah ?
EVELYN: Yes . He never forgave him for it .
GITTES: Never forgave him for what ?
EVELYN: For talking him into building it , he never forgave my father They have n't spoken to this day .
GITTES: You sure shout that ?
EVELYN: Of course I 'm sure .
GITTES: What about you ? Do you and your fathe get along ?
EVELYN: What are you thinking ?
GITTES: Before this I turned on the faucet , it came out hot and cold , I did n't think there was a thing to it .
OLD MAN: You 'll have to sit with the pilot .
PILOT: Well , you 're not going fishing . Gittes shakes his head .
GITTES: Not exactly .
PILOT: But that 's what you told your wife .
GITTES: I 'm going to see a man called Julian Cross . Ever heard of him ?
PILOT: Is the Pope Catholic ? Who are you , mister ? I ask because he does n't see a whole lot of people .
GITTES: I 'm working for his daughter .
PILOT: That right ? She used to be some looker .
GITTES: She ai n't exactly long in the tooth now .
PILOT: She must be about thirty-three , thirty- four .
GITTES: You must be thinking of a different daughter .
PILOT: No , he 's only got one , I remembe her age , I read it in the newspapers when she ran away .
GITTES: She ran away ?
PILOT: Oh yeah , it was a big thing at the time . Julian Cross ' daughter . God almighty . She was a wild little thing .
GITTES: Well , you never know , do you ?
PILOT: That 's for sure .
GITTES: Why 'd she run away ?
PILOT: Oh , you know . She was sixteen o seventeen .
GITTES: We missed the best of it , did n't we , pal ? Both men laugh a little lewdly .
PILOT: She ran off to Mexico . Rumor was she was knocked up and did n't even know who the father was . Went there to get rid of it .
GITTES: You do n't say ?
PILOT: Cross was looking for her all ove the country . Offered rewards , everything . Felt real sorry for him , with all his money .
CROSS: Horseshit .
GITTES: Sir ?
CROSS: I said horseshit . Horseshit .
GITTES: Yes , sir , that 's what it looks like . I 'll give you that .
CROSS: Love the smell of it . A lot of people do but of course they wo n't admit it . Look at the shape . Gittes glances down out of politeness .
GITTES: Always ?
CROSS: What ? Oh , damn near yes . Unless the animal 's sick or something . And the steam rising off it like that in the morning . That 's life , Mr. Gittes . Life . They move on .
GITTES: Thanks .
CROSS: If you were a bank president that would be one thing , but in you usiness it 's admirable . And it 's good advertising .
GITTES: It does n't hurt .
CROSS: It 's why you attract a client like my daughter .
GITTES: Probably .
CROSS: But I 'm surprised you 're still working for her , unless she 's suddenly come up with another husband .
GITTES: No . She happens to think the last one was murdered . Cross is visibly surprised .
CROSS: How did she get that idea ?
GITTES: I think I gave it to her . Cross nods .
CROSS: Uh-huh . Oh I hope you do n't mind . I elieve they should be served with the head .
GITTES: Fine , as long as you do n't serve chicken that way .
CROSS: Tell me . What do the police say ?
GITTES: They 're calling it an accident .
CROSS: Who 's the investigating officer ?
GITTES: Lou Escobar – he 's a Lieutenant .
CROSS: Do you know him ?
GITTES: Oh yes .
CROSS: Where from ?
GITTES: We worked in Chinatown together .
CROSS: Would you call him a capable man ?
GITTES: Very .
CROSS: Honest ?
GITTES: Far as it goes . Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do .
CROSS: Of course , but you 've got no reason to think he 's bungled the case ?
GITTES: None .
CROSS: That 's too bad .
GITTES: Too bad ?
CROSS: It disturbs me , Mr. Gittes . It makes me think you 're taking my daughte for a ride . Financially speaking , of course . How much are you charging her ?
GITTES: My usual fee , plus a bonus if I come up with any results .
CROSS: Are you sleeping with her ? Come , come , Mr. Gittes . You do n't have to think about that to remember , do you ? Gittes laughs .
GITTES: If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job . Good afternoon , Mr. Cross .
CROSS: Mr. Gittes ! You 're dealing with a disturbed woman who 's lost he husband . I do n't want her taken advantage of . Sit down .
GITTES: What for ?
CROSS: You may think you know what you 're dealing with , but believe me , you do n't .
GITTES: It 's what the D.A . used to tell me about Chinatown .
CROSS: Was he right ? Gittes shrugs .
GITTES: Mainly that you 're rich and too espectable to want your name in the papers .
CROSS: 'Course I 'm respectable . I 'm old . Politicians , ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough . I 'll double whateve your fees are and I 'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis ' girlfriend .
GITTES: His girlfriend ?
CROSS: Yes , his girlfriend .
GITTES: You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando ?
CROSS: Yes . She 's disappeared , has n't she ?
GITTES: Yeah .
CROSS: Does n't that strike you as odd ?
GITTES: No . She 's probably scared to death .
CROSS: Would n't it be useful to talk to her ?
GITTES: Maybe .
CROSS: If Mulwray was murdered , she was probably one of the last people to see him .
GITTES: You did n't see Mulwray much , did you ?
CROSS: No .
GITTES: When was the last time ?
CROSS: Sheriff 's gold posse bunch of damn fools who pay $ 5,000 apiece to the sheriff 's reelection . I let 'em practice up out here .
GITTES: Yeah . Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray ? Cross shakes his head .
CROSS: At my age , you tend to lose track
GITTES: Well , It was about five days ago . You were outside the Pig ' n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument . Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise .
CROSS: My daughter .
GITTES: What about her ?
CROSS: Just find the girl , Mr. Gittes . I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her . I 'd like to help her if I can .
GITTES: I did n't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other . Cross looks hatefully at Gittes .
CROSS: Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized .
GITTES: If you want to hire me , I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about .
CROSS: Well she 's an extremely jealous person . I did n't want her to find out about the girl .
GITTES: How did you find out ?
CROSS: I 've still got a few teeth in my head , Mr. Gittes , and a few friends in town .
GITTES: Okay . My secretary 'll send you a letter of agreement . Tell me are you worried about that girl , or what Evelyn might do to her ?
CROSS: Just find the girl .
GITTES: I 'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves .
CROSS: Avocado groves ?
GITTES: We 'll be in touch , Mr. Cross .
CLERK: Part of it 's in Ventura County . We do n't have Ventura County in ou Hall of Records . Which is a snotty remark . Gittes smiles .
GITTES: I 'll settle for L.A. County .
CLERK: Row twenty-three , section C .
GITTES: Hauls the huge volume back to the Clerk 's desk .
CLERK: Land sales out of escrow are always ecorded within the week . Gittes looks a little surprised .
GITTES: Then these are all new owners ?
CLERK: That 's right .
GITTES: But that means that most of the valley 's been sold in the last few months .
CLERK: If that 's what it says .
GITTES: Can I check one of these volumes out ?
CLERK: Sir , this is not a lending library , it 's the Hall of Records .
GITTES: Well , then , how about a ruler ?
CLERK: A ruler ?
GITTES: The print 's pretty fine . I forgot my glasses . I 'd like to be able to read across .
CHILD: Making some rain .
GITTES: Well , you 're just the man I 'm looking for .
RAINMAKER: No problem with me on the Job .
GITTES: Yeah . Do you have any references ?
RAINMAKER: City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days .
GITTES: That 's swell . But how about here ? Ever worked for Robert Knox , Emma Dill , Clarence Speer , Marian Parsons , or Jasper Lamar Crabb ?
RAINMAKER: Never heard of 'em new owners ?
GITTES: Yeah .
RAINMAKER: Lot of turnover these days . Bette tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land .
GITTES: Yeah , I 'll do that .
BIG FARMER: He ai n't armed .
GITTES: Get away from me !
CRIPPLED FARMER: Answer him !
GITTES: Touch me with that thing again and you 'll need a pair of them .
BIG FARMER: Why n't you pick on somebody your own size ?
GITTES: Name 's Gittes . I 'm a private investigator and I 'm not with eithe one .
BIG FARMER: Mulwray ? That 's the son of a bitch who 's done it to us .
GITTES: Mulwray 's dead . You do n't know what you 're talking about , you dumb Oakie .
GITTES: What 's going on ?
DUBOIS: You did n't look too good , so we thought we better call your employer .
GITTES: It 's okay , Mr. Dubois .
DUBOIS,: It 's just that they 're after everybody out here , tearing up our irrigation ditches trying to make our land worthless so they can pick it up fo twenty-five dollars an acre . Gittes nods .
DUBOIS: Anyway . Earl here is sorry , too . He wants to give you something to take ack with you .
GITTES: Thanks , Earl .
EVELYN: What dam ?
GITTES: The one your husband opposed . They 're conning L.A. into building it , only the water wo n't go to L.A . It 'll go here .
EVELYN: The Valley ?
GITTES: Everything you can see , everything around us . I was at the Hall of Records today . That bother you ?

EVELYN: And Hollis knew about it ?
GITTES: It 's why he was killed . Jasper Lama Crabb . Jasper Lamar Crabb .

PALMER: Hello there , I 'm Mr. Palmer . Can I help you folks ?
GITTES: Yes , I sure hope so . It 's Dad . I just ca n't handle him anymore , can I , sweetheart ? Evelyn shakes her head .
PALMER: Oh my goodness .
GITTES: Nothing to do with Dad . It 's me , actually .
EVELYN: They just do n't get along very well . Dad 's a lamb with anyone else .
PALMER: Oh , well , I do n't know .
GITTES: Naturally , I want the best for him , money is no object .
PALMER: Perhaps if we could meet your father .
GITTES: There 's just one question .
PALMER: Of course .
GITTES: Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion ?
PALMER: I 'm sorry . We do n't .
GITTES: Do n't be sorry , neither does Dad . Wanted to make sure though , did n't we , honey ?
PALMER: We do n't reveal the names of ou guests as a matter of policy . I know you 'd appreciate that if your fathe came to live with us . Gittes locks eyes with Palmer .
GITTES: That 's exactly what we wanted to hear .
PALMER: Oh , good .
GITTES: I wonder , is it too late for us to have a look around ?
PALMER: I do n't think so . Be happy to show you .
GITTES: Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own ?
PALMER: Just , if you will , confine yourself to the main building . It 's nearly edtime .
GITTES: We understand , c'mon , sweetheart . He takes Evelyn .
EVELYN: They ca n't be .
GITTES: They may not know it but they are .
EMMA: Yes .
GITTES: I 've been wanting to meet you .
EMMA: Why ?
GITTES: Did you know that you 're a very wealthy woman ?
EMMA: I 'm not .
GITTES: Well you own a lot of land .
EMMA: Not anymore . Oh , some time ago , my late husband owned a good deal of each property in Long Beach , but we lost it .
GITTES: That 's just lovely .
EMMA: Thank you
GITTES: Where did you get this material ?
EMMA: The apple core club .
GITTES: The apple core ?
EMMA: No . The albacore . It 's a fish . My grandson 's a member and they take very nice care of us .
GITTES: How do they do that ?
EMMA: Give us things . Not just some old flag like this , but –-
GITTES: But what ?
PALMER'S VOICE: We 're a sort of unofficial charity of theirs , Mr. Gittes . Would you care to come this way ? Someone wants to see you .
GITTES: See you later , Emma .
MULVIHILL: Come on I want you to meet somebody , Gittes .
GITTES: Can we leave the lady out of this ?
MULVIHILL: Yeah , why not ?
GITTES: Okay , I 'd like to walk her to he car .
EVELYN: I 'll stay .
GITTES: Get in the car .
MULVIHILL: I 'll see she makes it .
GITTES: What are you waiting for ? Get in the car ! Evelyn goes .
EVELYN: Get in .
GITTES: Maid 's night off ?
EVELYN: Why ?
GITTES: What do you mean , 'why ? ' Nobody 's here , that 's all .
EVELYN: I gave everybody the night off .
GITTES: Easy , it 's an innocent question .
EVELYN: No question from you is innocent , Mr. Gittes .
GITTES: I guess not to you , Mrs. Mulwray . Frankly you really saved my a my neck tonight . They drink .
EVELYN: Tell me something . Does this usually happen to you , Mr. Gittes ?
GITTES: What 's that , Mrs. Mulwray ?
EVELYN: Well , I 'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening , but if that 's how you go about your work , I 'd say you 're lucky to get through a whole day .
GITTES: Actually this has n't happened to me in some time .
EVELYN: When was the last time ?
GITTES: Why ?
EVELYN: Just . I do n't know why . I 'm asking . Gittes touches his nose , winces a little .
GITTES: It was in Chinatown .
EVELYN: What were you doing there ?
GITTES: Working for the District Attorney .
EVELYN: Doing what ? Gittes looks sharply at her . Then
GITTES: As little as possible .
EVELYN: The District Attorney gives his men advice like that ?
GITTES: They do in Chinatown .
EVELYN: Bothers you to talk about it , does n't it ? Gittes gets up .
GITTES: No . I wonder could I . Do you have any peroxide or something ? He touches his nose lightly .
EVELYN: Oh sure . C'mon .
GITTES: Yeah .
EVELYN: So why does it bother you to talk about it Chinatown
GITTES: Bothers everybody who works there , ut to me It was Gittes shrugs .
EVELYN: Hold still . Why ?
GITTES: You ca n't always tell what 's going on there .
EVELYN: No . Why was it .
GITTES: I thought I was keeping someone from eing hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt .
EVELYN: Could you do anything about it ?
GITTES: Yeah . Make sure I do n't find myself in Chinatown anymore . Wait a second .
EVELYN: What 's wrong ?
GITTES: Your eye .
EVELYN: What about it ?
GITTES: There 's something black in the green part of your eye .
EVELYN: Oh that It 's a flaw in the iris
GITTES: A flaw
EVELYN: Yes , sort of a birthmark
GITTES: Where ?
EVELYN: Just I have to .
GITTES: And I want to know where .
EVELYN: Please do n't be angry believe me , it 's got nothing to do with you .
GITTES: Where are you going ?
EVELYN: Please ! Trust me this much I 'll be back . Look , there is something I should tell you . The fishing clu that old lady mentioned , the pieces off the flag .
GITTES: The Albacore Club .
EVELYN: It has to do with my father .
GITTES: I know .
EVELYN: He owns it . You know ?
GITTES: I saw him .
EVELYN: You saw my fa father ? When ?
GITTES: This morning .
EVELYN: You did n't tell me .
GITTES: There has n't been a lot of time . She leaps out of bed , throwing on a robe .
EVELYN: What did he say ? What did he say ?
GITTES: That you were jealous , and he was worried about what you might do .
EVELYN: Do ? To who ?
GITTES: Mulwray 's girlfriend , for one thing . He wanted to know where she was .
EVELYN: I want you to listen to me . My fathe is a very dangerous man . You do n't know how dangerous . You do n't know how crazy .
GITTES: Give me an example .
EVELYN: You may think you know what 's going on , but you do n't .
GITTES: That 's what your father said . You 're telling me he 's in back of this whole thing ?
EVELYN: It 's possible .
GITTES: Including the death of your husband ?
EVELYN: It 's possible . Please do n't ask me any more questions now . Just wait , wait for me . I 'll be back . I need you here .
EVELYN: You bastard .
GITTES: It 's either that or you drive to the police yourself .
EVELYN: The police ?
GITTES: C'mon , Mrs. Mulwray . You 've got you husband 's girlfriend tied up in there !
EVELYN: She 's not tied up !
GITTES: You know what I mean . You 're keeping her there against her will .
EVELYN: I am not !
GITTES: Then let 's go talk to her .
EVELYN: No !
GITTES: What about ?
EVELYN: Hollis ' death . I tried to keep it from her , I did n't want her upset efore I could make plans for her to leave .
GITTES: You mean she just found out ?
EVELYN: Yes .
GITTES: That 's not what it looks like , Mrs. Mulwray .
EVELYN: What does it look like ?
GITTES: Like she knows about Hollis ' death . Like she knows more than you want her to tell .
EVELYN: You 're insane . Gittes explodes .
GITTES: Just tell me the truth . I 'm not the police . I do n't care what you 've done . I 'm not going to hurt you , but one way or another I 'm going to know .
EVELYN: You wo n't go to the police if I tell you ?
GITTES: I will if you do n't .
EVELYN: She 's my sister .
GITTES: Take it easy If it 's your siste it 's your sister why all the secrecy ?
EVELYN: I ca n't
GITTES: Because of Hollis ? Because she was seeing your husband ? Was that it ? Jesus Christ , say something . Was that it ? She nods . Gittes sighs .
EVELYN: I would never ever have harmed Hollis . I loved him more than my own family . He was the most gentle , decent man imaginable and he put up with more from me than you 'll ever know I just wanted him to be happy She begins to cry softly .
GITTES: I took your husband 's Buick I 'll return it tomorrow .
EVELYN: Are n't you coming back with me ?
GITTES: Do n't worry . I 'm not telling anybody about this .
EVELYN: That 's not what I meant .
GITTES: Yeah , well I 'm very tired , Mrs. Mulwray . Good night .
ESCOBAR: Find anything interesting , Gittes ?
GITTES: Did n't you call ?
ESCOBAR: How do you happen to know her ?
GITTES: I do n't .
ESCOBAR: Let me show you something .
GITTES: Is it ? I forget . I do n't call myself that often .
ESCOBAR: Just to be on the safe side , we had Loach here give you a ring . He indicates one of his assistants .
ESCOBAR'S ASSISTANT: What happened to your nose , Gittes ? Somebody slam a bedroom window on it ?
GITTES: Nope , your wife got excited , crossed her legs a little too quick . You understand , pal .
ESCOBAR: Loach . How about these ? Look familiar ?
GITTES: Yeah , I took 'em . So what ?
ESCOBAR: How did she happen to have them ? Gittes takes a deep breath .
GITTES: Either you tell me or I guess 'cause I do n't have the answer . Escobar nods .
ESCOBAR: You really think I 'm stupid , do n't you , Gittes ?
GITTES: I do n't think about it one way o the other . But if you want , give me a day or two , and I 'll get back to you . Now I 'd like to go home .
ESCOBAR: I want the rest of the pictures .
GITTES: What pictures ?
ESCOBAR: This broad hired you , Gittes , not Evelyn Mulwray .
GITTES: Yeah ?
ESCOBAR: Yeah . Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray , she hired you , and that 's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered .
GITTES: I heard it was an accident .
ESCOBAR: C'mon , you think you 're dealing with a bunch of assholes ? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs ! Now how did he get that in a fresh water reservoir ?
GITTES: You accusing me of extortion ?
ESCOBAR: Absolutely .
GITTES: I do n't think I need a day or two . You 're even dumber than you think I think you are . Not only that , I 'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy , that 's where I draw the line , Escobar .
ESCOBAR: Yeah , I once knew a whore who fo enough money would piss in a customer 's face , but she 'd neve shit on his chest . That 's where she drew the line .
GITTES: Well , I hope she was n't too much of a disappointment to you , Lou . Escobar manages a thin smile .
ESCOBAR: I want those photographs , Gittes . We 're talking about accessory afte the fact , conspiracy , and extortion . Minimum .
GITTES: Why do you think Mulwray 's body was moved you dimwit ? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir ? This is a little telling .
ESCOBAR: And why 's that ?
GITTES: He found out somebody was dumping water there . That 's what they were trying to cover up by moving him . This stops Escobar . He 's dumbfounded by it .
ESCOBAR: What are you talking about ?
GITTES: C'mon I 'll show you . Escobar hesitates .
ESCOBAR: Too late for what ?
GITTES: They only dump the water at night .
ESCOBAR: Reach anybody ?
THIRD ASSISTANT: Yelburton , he 's the new chief .
ESCOBAR: I know who he is . Well ?
THIRD ASSISTANT: He says –-
GITTES: I know what he says .
ESCOBAR: Shut up . Go on .
THIRD ASSISTANT: Yelburton says they 're irrigating in the valley . There 's always a little unoff when they do that . And he says is Gittes knows that , and has een going around making irresponsible accusations for the last week .
GITTES: Because he just made lieutenant , and he wants to hang onto his little gold bar . Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes .
ESCOBAR: Have your client in my office in two hours and remember . I do n't have to let you go . I 've got you fo withholding evidence right now .
GITTES: Where 's Mrs. Mulwray ?
MAID: No esta .
GITTES: Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace ? on a trip ? vacation ?
MAID: No esta in casa .
GITTES: Ca n't quite believe what he 's heard ,
GARDENER: Velly velly bad .
CROSS' VOICE: Hello .
GITTES: Have you got your checkbook handy , Mr. Cross ? I 've got the girl .
CROSS' VOICE: You 've got her ? Where ?

GITTES: Either that or she 'll be in jail .

CHINESE SERVANT: You wait .
GITTES: You wait .

GITTES: Where 's the girl ?
EVELYN: Upstairs . Why ?
GITTES: I want to see her .
EVELYN: she 's having a bath now why do you want to see her ?
GITTES: Going somewhere ?
EVELYN: Yes , we 've got a 4 30 train to catch . Why ?
GITTES: J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escoba
EVELYN: What are you doing ? What 's wrong ? I told you we 've got a 4 30 .
GITTES: You 're going to miss your train ! Lou , meet me at 1412 Adelaide . It 's above Santa Monica Canyon yeah , soon as you can .
EVELYN: What did you do that for ?
GITTES: You know any good criminal lawyers ?
EVELYN: No
GITTES: Do n't worry . I can recommend a couple . They 're expensive but you can afford it .
EVELYN: What the hell is this all about ?
GITTES: I found these in your backyard in your fish pond . They belonged to your husband , did n't they ? did n't they ?
EVELYN: I do n't know . I mean yes , probably .
GITTES: Yes positively . That 's where he was drowned
EVELYN: What are you saying ?
GITTES: There 's no time for you to be shocked y the truth , Mrs. Mulwray . The coroner 's report proves he was killed in salt water . Just take my word fo it . Now I want to know how it happened and why . I want to know before Escoba gets here because I want to hang onto my license .
EVELYN: I do n't know what you 're talking about . This is the most insane the craziest thing I ever
GITTES: Stop it ! I 'll make it easy . You were jealous , you fought , he fell , hit his head . It was an accident , ut his girl is a witness . You 've had to pay her off . You do n't have the stomach to harm her , but you 've got the money to shut her up . Yes o no ?
EVELYN: no
GITTES: Who is she ? And do n't give me that crap about it being your sister . You do n't have a sister . Evelyn is trembling .
EVELYN: I 'll tell you the truth Gittes smiles .
GITTES: That 's good . Now what 's her name ?
EVELYN: Katherine .
GITTES: Katherine ? Katherine who ?
EVELYN: She 's my daughter .
GITTES: I said the truth !
EVELYN: She 's my sister . Gittes slaps her again .
GITTES: I said I want the truth .
EVELYN: She 's my sister and my daughter ! Kyo comes running down the stairs .
GITTES: To Mexico She nods .
EVELYN: Hollis came and took care of me after she was born he said he took care of her I could n't see her I wanted to but I could n't I just want to see her once in a while take care of her that 's all but I do n't want her to know I do n't want her to know
GITTES: so that 's why you hate him Evelyn looks slowly up at Gittes .
EVELYN: No for turning his back on me after it happened ! He could n't face it I hate him .
GITTES: Yeah where are you taking he now ?
EVELYN: Back to Mexico .
GITTES: You ca n't go by train . Escobar 'll be looking for you everywhere .
EVELYN: How about a plane ?
GITTES: That 's worse Just get out of here . Walk out , leave everything .
EVELYN: I have to go home and get my things .
GITTES: I 'll take care of it .
EVELYN: Where can we go ?
GITTES: where does Kyo live ?
EVELYN: With us .
GITTES: On his day off . Get the exact address .
EVELYN: Okay She stops suddenly .

GITTES: Sophie is Walsh there ? yeah , listen , pal , Escobar 's going to try and book me in about five minutes elax , I 'll tell you . Wait in the office for two hours . If you do n't hear from me , you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda .
WALSH'S VOICE: Jesus , that 's in Chinatown , ai n't it ? The front BELL RINGS .
GITTES: I know where it is ! Just do it .
ESCOBAR: I do n't suppose you got any idea Where she went ?
GITTES: Matter of fact I do .
ESCOBAR: Where ?
GITTES: Her maid 's house . I think she knows something 's up .
ESCOBAR: What 's the maid 's address ?
GITTES: She lives in Pedro . I 'll write it down for you .
ESCOBAR: No , Gittes , you 'll show us .
GITTES: What for ?
ESCOBAR: If she 's not there , you 're going downtown , and you 're staying there til she shows up .
GITTES: Gee , Lou , I 'm doing the best I can .
ESCOBAR: Tell us about it on the way to Pedro .
GITTES: Yeah .
ESCOBAR: Well , let 's go .
GITTES: Do me a favor , will you , Lou ? Escobar waits .
ESCOBAR: You never learn , do you , Gittes ?
GITTES: I guess not .
ESCOBAR: Give you three minutes .
GITTES: Gee , thanks , Lou .
WOMAN: Yes ?
CURLY: Mr. Gittes ! Come in , come in .
GITTES: Call me Jake . How is everything ?
CURLY: Just sitting down to supper , Jake . Care to join us ?
GITTES: No thanks .
CURLY: How about a glass of wine ? Honey , this is
WIFE: Yes , I know .
GITTES: Thanks just the same , Curly . I could use a glass of water , though . Come out with me to the kitchen for a second .
CURLY: Sure thing .
GITTES: Curly , where 's your car ?
CURLY: In the garage .
GITTES: Where 's that ?

GITTES: Could you drive me somewhere ?
CURLY: Sure , as soon as we eat .
GITTES: Right now , Curly . It ca n't wait .
CURLY: I 'll just tell my wife .
GITTES: Tell her later .
GITTES' VOICE: Just drive slow for a block or two , will you , Curly ?
CURLY'S VOICE: What 's this all about ?
GITTES' VOICE: Tell you in a couple of blocks .
GITTES: How much do you owe me , Curly ?
CURLY: Oh , gee , Mr. Gittes we 're going out tomorrow . I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie 's sick .
GITTES: Forget it . How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada you 'd have to leave tonight .
CURLY: I do n't know
GITTES: I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it fo you . Maybe an even hundred .
CURLY: Plus what I owe you ?
GITTES: I 'll throw that in too .
CURLY: Okay , you got yourself a boat .
GITTES: Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there . Then if I do n't show , take her down to the oat .
CURLY: You sure this is okay ?
GITTES: Curly , you know how long I been in usiness .
CROSS: There you are .
GITTES: I 've got her .
CROSS: Is she all right ?
GITTES: She 's fine .
CROSS: Where is she ?
GITTES: With her mother . Cross ' tone alters here .
CROSS: with her mother ?
GITTES: I 'd like you to look at something , Mr. Cross .
CROSS: What is it ?
GITTES: An obituary column can you read in this light ?
CROSS: Yes I think I can manage
CROSS: What does this mean ?
GITTES: That you killed Hollis Mulwray .
CROSS: Hollie was always fond of tide-pools . You know what he used to say about them ?
GITTES: Have n't the faintest idea .
CROSS: That 's where life begins marshes , sloughs , tide-pools he was fascinated by them you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there , instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs . You 'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy o eighty . He made this city .
GITTES: And that 's what you were going to do in the Valley ?
CROSS: No , Mr. Gittes . That 's what I am doing with the Valley . The bond issue passes Tuesday . There 'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and eservoir . I 'm doing it .
GITTES: There 's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they 're paying for water they 're not getting .
CROSS: That 's all taken care of . You see , Mr. Gittes . Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water .
GITTES: How do you do that ?
CROSS: Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. afte all . It 's very simple . Gittes nods .
GITTES: How much are you worth ?
CROSS: I have no idea . How much do you want ?
GITTES: I want to know what you 're worth . Over ten million ?
CROSS: Oh , my , yes .
GITTES: Then why are you doing it ? How much etter can you eat ? What can you buy that you ca n't already afford ?
CROSS: The future , Mr. Gittes . The future . Now where 's the girl ? I want the only daughter I have left as you found out , Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago .
GITTES: Who do you blame for that ? Her ? Cross makes a funny little cock of his head .
CROSS: I do n't blame myself . You see , Mr. Gittes , most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and right place , they 're capable of anything . Take those glasses from him , will you , Claude ?
CROSS: Stop the car . Stop the car !
GITTES: No , Curly , get 'em out of here ! Get 'em out of here !
EVELYN: No , do n't help him . Do n't do anything .
CROSS: Where ?
GITTES: Let me handle that .
EVELYN: I 'm all right .
GITTES: Sure , but I 'd like to handle it .
CROSS: You 're going to have to kill me , Evelyn . Either that or tell me where she is .
EVELYN: She 's never going to know that .
GITTES: Duffy , go over and sit on Mulvihill . Jesus Christ , I did n't tell you to ing the police department with you .
WALSH: Jake , it 's Chinatown . They 're all over the place . You oughta know etter .
GITTES: Gim me your keys . Watch this old fart , will you ? Take Duffy 's car . Curly 's boat 's in Pedro , near the Starkist cannery . It 's the Evening Star . He 'll be waiting . I 'll take care of this .
ESCOBAR: Mrs. Mulwray , you do n't want to run around like that .
GITTES: Oh , Christ . Escobar , you do n't know what 's going on . Let her go . I 'll explain it later .
ESCOBAR: Mrs. Mulwray , it 's a very serious offense pointing that at an office of the law . It 's a felony .
GITTES: Let her go . She did n't kill anybody .
ESCOBAR: I 'm sorry , Mrs. Mulwray .
GITTES: Lou , she will kill you . Let her go for now . You do n't know .
ESCOBAR: Gittes , stay outta this .
GITTES: Now take off .
ESCOBAR: I 'll just have her followed . She 's not going anywhere .
GITTES: No !
ESCOBAR: Take it easy , take it easy , it was an accident .
GITTES: An accident ?
ESCOBAR: Jake , you 're very disturbed . You 're crazy . That 's her father . Walsh and Duffy elbow through the crowd .
LOUIS: Something is bothering you
QUINN: I appreciate the faux concern but I 'm fine . Louis is taken aback .
LOUIS: My concern is genuine
QUINN: With our history can you honestly say you care about my well being ?
LOUIS: Yes I can , our connection is a product of destiny . I have no ill-will against you . Quinn scoffs .
QUINN: 1941-
LOUIS: -The Stephen Speilberg film ?
QUINN: No , there was that little French girl I liked . You..you violated her and torched her farm killing her family-
LOUIS: -Actually you are jacking up the story , I violated her father in front of herthen I torched the farm .
QUINN: Wellthat makes it ten times better .
LOUIS: Quinn that was war , people do crazy things midst of wide spread conflict . I have gotten jaded over time . It 's not like the dark ages when I had style .
QUINN: When you would rape the horses and ride away on the women ?
LOUIS: Yeah I was such a ham . Quinn , this is what we do . I have gotten carried away in the past , but now I 'm tired . I just want to get this over with . It 's our calling , we help bring order and alance to the universe . Maybe I would feel less removed if you would let me win just once .
QUINN: This is n't a 1930 's boxing match . If I take dive , I 'm not lining the pockets of some bookieI 'm bringing on the apocalypse . Louis takes a drink of his coffee .
LOUIS: See at least our obligation would be over .
QUINN: Louis I might be nervous , but I accept my ole as savior of this world . We have been doing this for years-
LOUIS: -centuries-
QUINN: -and in 5 days we will do the same thing we have always done .
LOUIS: Atta ' boy !
ZOEY: I 'm not saying this is an intervention . Rick does n't look up from his laptop screen .
RICK: Would n't there be more people here if it was an intervention ?
ZOEY: See and I do n't want it to be-
RICK: -That 's because it 's not
ZOEY: It 's justI meanare you gambling again ?
RICK: Nope .
ZOEY: Becauseumthe laptop , and you neve go anywhere with out it-
RICK: -it 's my lifeline-
ZOEY: -Yeah wellI just know when I met you I saved you from that downhill spiralyou knowuhthe online poker-
RICK: -I 'm not a project , you know that right ?
ZOEY: Of course notI never said you were .
RICK: Because you act like itI wonder if I did n't have this `` so called problem '' if you would have even been interested in me .
ZOEY: Of course I would . I just-
RICK: -Take it upon yourself to save people .
ZOEY: OKmaybe . Honestly we have to save each other , who else is going to do it .
RICK: People could just save themselves .
ZOEY: True . Is that human nature ? People rely on false deities , self help booksRick the day I realized we were alone in the universe was the day I realized we have to be there for each other . Plus do n't you find it romantic that I want to save you ? Like a movie
RICK: So our relationship is like a romantic comedy ?
ZOEY: A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy .
RICK: Oh wellso do you want to see what I 'm doing on the computer ?
ZOEY: Yesof course !
RICK: Check that out Lloyd Dobler .

ZOEY: I 'm not trying to be confrontationalI justyou are breaking up with me ?
RICK: -YeahCan I have my laptop back now ?
LOUIS: This will do .
QUINN: So what are you wanting to do ? Louis searches around for a stick of his own .
LOUIS: I figure we would train
QUINN: Why ?
LOUIS: Because you dominate me every time- -ohh that sounded dirty
QUINN: So you want me to help you get an advantage ?
LOUIS: No , I want you to help me put on a good show . Everyone loves a good climax Quinn .
ANNA: You know I do n't like interjecting myself into other people 's affairs but-
ZOEY: -But you 're going to
ANNA: You let Rick do this to you .
ZOEY: How so ?
ANNA: You think you can change the men you are with . You ca n't get into a relationship with someone in the hopes that you can mold them into the person you want them to be .
ZOEY: Rick needed someone stable-
ANNA: -Rick needs castrated .
ZOEY: That 's slightly strong .
ANNA: He was an asshole .
ZOEY: Misunderstood-
ANNA: -OK I 'll meet you half waymisunderstood asshole . You have been repeating the same cycle your whole entire life .
ZOEY: Now that 's a little off base .
ZOEY: Exaggerations-
ANNA: -Accurate account of events The story of your romantic life-
ZOEY: -Unfair . Because these people need someone who is going to sacrifice thei own needs for them .
ANNA: Why ?
ZOEY: Who else is going to do it ? We 're alone in the universe . If we are going to make it through this `` crazy world '' we need to look out for each other .
ANNA: I think you use atheism and the whole `` we are alone in the universe '' jive to justify your actions . I regret taking you to see Dawkins ecause you use that as a fall back to be codependent .
ZOEY: First of all you are bitter about the whole Dawkins thing , because you flashed him your tits and got us kicked out-
ANNA: -You did n't even know the first thing about `` The God Delusion '' until I gave you a copy-
ZOEY: -And someone who was huge supporter turns her back because Richard Dawkins did n't like her nipple piercing-
ANNA: -Enjoy your suite in hell non-believer-
ZOEY: -Enjoy your delusional life there fence sitter . How about you pray to Thor to hit me with a lighting bolt so I can be emoved from this asinine conversation .
ANNA: You 're hiding behind this religious debate because you do n't want to admit you have always gravitated toward the `` wrong type '' of guy . Zoey is staring off into space .
ZOEY: I actually stopped listening to you .
ANNA: What are you staring at ?
ZOEY: Who are those guys ?
ANNA: The one closest to us is Quinn . Very weird , socially awkward type of guy . I do n't know who his friend is .
ZOEY: What are they doing ?
ANNA: I do n't know . Looks like that stuff my ex- Rob was into-
ZOEY: Oh that medieval rugby style game-
ANNA: -Yeah the made up sport from `` Blood Of Heroes '' OhJugger ! -
ZOEY: -Sounds pornographic . So Quinn ? What else do you know about him ?
ANNA: Oh no you do n't ! This is exactly what I was talking about !
ZOEY: What is this MI-6 ?
ANNA: You have your sights on him already !
ZOEY: No , I 'm just curious .
ANNA: What happened ?
ZOEY: I 'm so sorry
QUINN: Is this yours ?
ZOEY: Kinda Again I 'm so sorry .
QUINN: No need to apologize . Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit .
QUINN: Quinn . Zoey ? Interesting .
ZOEY: Oh name ? Yes , most people have interesting stories behind thei namesHonestly I have nothing . Not sure why my parents did that .
QUINN: Very unique .
ZOEY: I suppose that 's a compliment . So I 've seen you around school , but neve eallyinclass
QUINN: I do n't go to Marshall , I live near the campus though .
ZOEY: Oh , well so what do you do ?
QUINN: As in profession ? I do n't really have one .
ZOEY: Really ? Rent is insane around here
QUINN: Yeah , my father provides for me .
ZOEY: That 's pretty cool . What 's he into ?
QUINN: Everything .
ZOEY: An entrepreneurThat 's awesome . WellSo do you like coming down here ?
QUINN: To the river ?
ZOEY: Yes where we are right now .
QUINN: I just needed to think .
ZOEY: Yeah me too . I just suffered a break up .
QUINN: My apologies .
ZOEY: No it 's OK . I mean I 'm over it .
QUINN: My head disagrees .
ZOEY: I 'm sorry .
QUINN: It 's really OK .
ZOEY: So what did you need to think about ? I mean if I 'm not prying of course .
QUINN: No , I just have some problems . I 'm not sure about my calling in life .
ZOEY: I 'm not sure anyone is . You know if you need a friend , I 'd be glad towell you knowlisten .
QUINN: I 'd appreciate that . I do n't have many friends .
ZOEY: I know . I meanI 've seen you around campusyou seem like a lonerI did n't mean you were a loser . Loner is kind of sexy , loserwell can kind of be tooI 'll stop .
QUINN: No , it 's OK . I agree it never hurts to have a friend .
ZOEY: So we can maybe go out to dinner if you want ?
QUINN: OK
ZOEY: And I can pay , you know..make up for the head
QUINN: You really do n't have to .
ZOEY: No I want to .
QUINN: OK .
ZOEY: Well Good let 's meet up tonight . My place , 7pm .
JACK: So when does Ted Bundy get here ?
ANNA: I promised her we would behave . A KNOCK is heard at the front door .
JACK: You sit your pretty little ass down hooker .
ANNA: This is why I do n't need a boyfriend . You are way to good to me . Jack opens the door to reveal Quinn .
JACK: Look at this mother fucker .
QUINN: UmOK ?
ZOEY: Quinn , is he being rude ?
QUINN: No quite pleasant .
ZOEY: Let 's go .
JACK: I will call the state police in a fucking heart beat if she is n't here by midnight .
ZOEY: Anna , you going to call the guard dog off ?
ANNA: David Smith 's Candytakers is on tonight . I 'm relaxing and not getting in the middle .
QUINN: Nice meeting both of you .
JACK: Get the fuck out .
ZOEY: Do n't wait up
QUINN: I like him .
ZOEY: No not at all . This is on me .
QUINN: I can cover dessert at least .
ZOEY: Listen Quinn , I 'm an atheist-
QUINN: -So you do n't want dessert ? -
ZOEY: -No , I just wanted to get it out of the way . It bothers people , I mean in this state especially . Quinn puts down the menu .
QUINN: It does n't bother me .
ZOEY: Really ?
QUINN: I do n't believe anyone is truly an atheist at the end .
ZOEY: I 'm pretty sure I 'm really an atheist .
QUINN: Why 's that ?
ZOEY: Because I 'm a logical thinker . I do n't mean to offend , I 'm guessing you 're religious .
QUINN: One supports the business they are in I guess .
ZOEY: Oh my God you are in the ministry .
QUINN: Kind of .
ZOEY: My father was a `` fire and damnation '' preacher . BaptistHe 's
QUINN: He 's ?
ZOEY: It 's nothing . Sorry I do n't mean to rock your world .
QUINN: You did n't .
ZOEY: You poor thing . You are probably so desperate for friends-
QUINN: What ?
ZOEY: Have you thought about St John 's Wort ?
QUINN: You are a very cryptic speaker .
ZOEY: No I 'm thinking out loud mostly . I was justwellyou have some social awkwardness .
QUINN: OK ?
ZOEY: Well you are latching on to religion to make you feel whole . It does n't make you feel whole , or at least as whole as you thought it would-
QUINN: You are kind of right on that one .
ZOEY: So you are out with meI represent everything you were brought up to combat . You 're missing something and you are looking for help .
QUINN: I am looking for help . I 'm out with you though because I 'm interested in getting to know you .
ZOEY: See I 'm good at reading people .
QUINN: Kind of .
ZOEY: I do n't know Quinn you seem like a lost soul . I thought that when I saw you by the river .
QUINN: You like lost souls do n't you ?
ZOEY: Yeah I actually do . Someone needs to save them .
QUINN: You going to save me ?
ZOEY: If you let me .
QUINN: I think you might be able to .
ZOEY: So what do you need Quinn ?
QUINN: Dessert .
ANNA: I do n't know , he seems fishy .
ZOEY: He seems harmless .
ANNA: I have heard that a million times .
ZOEY: I know . He 's in the ministry-
ANNA: -and you hate organized religion .
ZOEY: I know and he 's understanding of that .
ANNA: Plus it 's to my understanding he did n't actually admit what he did . He just did a unch of double talk .
ZOEY: It was understood .
ANNA: Yeah againnot feeling confident in your choices . Please Zoey Be careful this time .
LOUIS: Where were you last night ?
QUINN: Outthinking .
LOUIS: You 've done a lot of mopping and thinking over the centuries . It kind of brings me down .
QUINN: So what do you need ?
LOUIS: Training .
QUINN: Not bad . Quinn points at the bag
LOUIS: You will love this .
QUINN: It 's kind of lightweight..and silly .
LOUIS: Come on give it a chance .
LOUIS: You have not been lively at all this go around .
QUINN: A lot on my mind
LOUIS: We only do this once every seventy years other . You have to enjoy it while it lasts .
QUINN: Louis our whole purpose here , is to show up , and over time establish a social ase , and then kill each other .
LOUIS: You know and I 'm very good at the social ase part , and you are not so good
QUINN: That 's because you find a way to screw it up every time .
LOUIS: That 's because , I know this is news to you , I represent evil .
QUINN: That 's something we agree on . I 'm tired too .
LOUIS: I do n't know if we can get off this train . It 's just a viscous cycle .
QUINN: Letting you win is not an option .
LOUIS: I was n't going there yet .
JACK: Yeah we do n't want to interrupt you `` date rape '' . Anna hits Jack .
ANNA: Jesus Jack ! He ca n't do anything here anyway . Too much exposure . Witnesses my friendWe knew he was here . Zoey sits down and hands the bowl to Quinn .
ZOEY: Will you guys stop ? ?
QUINN: It 's OK . I like your friends . Anna walks over to the couch .
ANNA: So Quinn ?
QUINN: Yes ?
ANNA: Zoey says you are in the ministry ?
QUINN: Sort of .
ANNA: You are or you are n't .
QUINN: It 's complicated .
ANNA: At some point you will have to explain it to Zoey . I mean do n't you agree ?
QUINN: Well
ZOEY: Will you guys leave ? ?
JACK: Who is going too far now ?
ANNA: `` Date Rape ''
ZOEY: Bye guys !
QUINN: It 's really OK .
JACK: You know I hate him because it 's my nature but-
ANNA: -You think I hate him because of my distrust of men ?
JACK: Tragedy changes people , it effected Zoey in one wayyou in another .
ANNA: Yeah I became a `` fag hag ''
ZOEY: Tonight 's Feature Presentation is `` I am Curious Yellow '' . Probably not the best date movie , but I always show this to ever guy in the beginning .
QUINN: It 's OK this will be my first film experience .
ZOEY: What ? ?
QUINN: Yeah , I 've never seen a film before . I mean I know of films , ca n't live in this world and not . I 've just never seen one .
ZOEY: This might be a little hard-core for you first film .
QUINN: No it 's OK . I 'm excited . Zoey shakes her head .
ZOEY: I feel like I 'm stealing your virginity here . Zoey slowly looks over at Quinn .
QUINN: You are not . Quinn motions to the TV .
ZOEY: OK ? I mean I usually play this fo potential boyfriends . If they can handle this , they can handle me . Zoey hits play on the remote .
QUINN: I am curious Yellow
LOUIS: What the hell are you talking about ? Quinn stands up and grabs the sword .
QUINN: Nothing really .
LOUIS: You half asleep Quinn ?
QUINN: Have you ever seen a movie ? Louis follows his lead .
LOUIS: I 've seen plenty of movies .
QUINN: Really ?
LOUIS: Yeah I watched `` The Sorrow and The Pity '' at Marshal the other day . You know people here have yet to figure out we are not students .
QUINN: I think they have a pretty good idea .
LOUIS: So in all the times we have been here , you have n't gone to the cinema ?
QUINN: No
LOUIS: Why not ?
QUINN: It 's not what we are here to do .
LOUIS: In your bosses name , what is wrong with you ? You 've got to enjoy yourself . You might be chosen , but you have needs . We all do .
QUINN: I have to stay focused .
LOUIS: You 've also burned yourself out . You 're not going to be any good to me Louis gets up and reaches out to help Quinn
LOUIS: You are a handsome devil .
LOUIS: Weird ? Louis walks out into
RYAN BLOOD: You looking for Quinn ?
LOUIS: Yes ?
RYAN BLOOD: He just left .
LOUIS: What do we have here ?
ZOEY: Why have n't I seen your place ?
QUINN: My place is n't very exciting .
ZOEY: That does n't surprise me . I ca n't imagine you having a vast Blu Ray collection .
QUINN: Blu Ray ?
ZOEY: WowQuinn , you have to start enjoying the world around you .
QUINN: You know I realized today you are right about that .
ZOEY: So you 're saying you want to come up stairs and watch `` They Call Her One Eye '' ?
QUINN: Uhno . I 'm still trying to get I am Curious Yellow out of my head .
ZOEY: Yeahsorry about that
QUINN: It 's OK .
ZOEY: II..I 'm sorry .
QUINN: No do n't be .
ZOEY: I should n't have been that aggressive .
QUINN: Noit 's OK .
ZOEY: OK ?
QUINN: I need to get back though .
ZOEY: Puzzlingbut I knowvirgin and all-
QUINN: -WellI mean
ZOEY: That came out rudeI just meanI wanted to do it . I should have taken it slower .
QUINN: It 's OK . I 'll be by tomorrow .
ZOEY: You sure ?
QUINN: Yes of course .
ZOEY: I hope so .
RYAN BLOOD: You 're here to learn more about his `` coming and goings '' . To find out what I have seen .
LOUIS: So far you are dead on .
RYAN BLOOD: It 's more than that Louis-
LOUIS: -You know who I am ?
RYAN BLOOD: I know pretty much everything . I 've watched you , studied youI feel I 'm expert on your little game every seventy years .
LOUIS: Really ?
RYAN BLOOD: Oh yes .
LOUIS: Where are you going with this you weird little man ?
RYAN BLOOD: You had strategy in the beginning . Middle AgesOld WestEven World War II . Let 's take a step back for a second . The Old West . Lack of faith , corruption , these things make Quinn weak . The chink in his armor is his faith in people . You knew that , and corrupting Americaa young landwas the key . Quinn was a step ahead of you , and looked for a human ally . That ally was Joseph Smith , and Quinnor I mean Moroniled Joseph to the plates that later when into-
LOUIS: How do I do that ?
RYAN BLOOD: This girl is distracting him . Get his mind focused on the matter at hand . At this point I 'm afraid he is n't even going to fight you .
LOUIS: I 'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn . He comes across creepy .
RYAN BLOOD: Maybe that 's the key-
LOUIS: -Make her think he 's crazy .
QUINN: You 've been waiting long ?
LOUIS: No I figured you were on your way back-
QUINN: -because you are spying on me again ? So I do n't need to tell you where I 've been . Louis sits down on the edge of the bed .
LOUIS: Who 's the girl ?
QUINN: It 's started again . You 're already jealous . You are going to do the same thing you did during the waryou 're going to sabotage this .
LOUIS: I 'm insulted frankly .
QUINN: Do n't you play that game . You are being facetious .
LOUIS: No , I 'm being serious . You care about the girl , it 's obvious . Not in a friendship or I 'm curious about human behavior way . Quinn sits down beside him .
QUINN: So why are you here ?
LOUIS: Have you told her ?
QUINN: Who I am ? Of course not !
LOUIS: Quinn you only have a few days left and you care for this girl- - What 's the harm in telling her ?
QUINN: There 's a lot of harm in telling her .
LOUIS: If this is real and you really care fo this girl , you have to tell her . It 's only fair to her .
QUINN: She has a best friend who is very guarded of meIt 's odd she eluded to the same thing . You know the whole `` I 'm hiding something , and I need to come out into the open '' thing .
LOUIS: Sounds to me like she is right . Quinn gets up and walks to the door .
QUINN: Well I better do this now then .
LOUIS: Yeah you do n't want to lose your nerve .
QUINN: Can you let yourself out ?
LOUIS: Of course .
ANNA: What the hell ? You can hear Jack inside the apartment .
QUINN: I need to see Zoey .
ANNA: What about tomorrow ? Or never is good . You hear Zoey off screen .
QUINN: I need to talk to you , it 's important .
ANNA: Jesus Christ !
QUINN: I need to tell you everything . Anna is so ight .
ZOEY: What are you talking about ? Anna is ight ?
QUINN: I 've not been honest with you about what I door who I am .
ZOEY: OK ?
QUINN: I need to come clean . I want you to trust me . I want your friends to trust me .
ZOEY: OK Quinn , just spit it out .
QUINN: OK I 'm an archangel named Moroni and I asically represent `` light '' or everything that 's good . Louis , my friend , represents `` darkness '' . Every seventy years we have to fight to the death . If I win everything stays the way it is . The world continues turning . If I lose , Louis takes on the role of the Antichrist and the apocalypse will be unleashed . I 'm talking Book of Revelations stuff here . So I only have a limited time left in this world I want to spend that time with you . Zoey is stunned , silent .
ZOEY: Oh honey Zoey touches his face .
QUINN: Zoey ? I
ZOEY: Shhh . You need me more than ever .
DAD: You 're not even helping me !
MOM: I do n't even know what you want !
DAD: I ca n't run my congregation with this sickness !
MOM: The sickness is in your head .
DAD: You 're too busy running around doing whatever you feel like . I 'm going to fall apart and it 's all on you .
QUINN: Last night ?
ZOEY: Yes ?
QUINN: Did you ?
ZOEY: Enjoy myself ? Of course .
QUINN: Based on how you are acting this morning I have my doubts . That 's not what I meant though . You woke up screaming .
ZOEY: It was nothing .
QUINN: I understand if you do n't want to talk about it . I 'm just concerned .
ZOEY: It 's not a big deal . It wasawell would n't call it a nightmarerepressed memory . Hell , it 's not repressedI think of it all the time .
QUINN: What is it ?
ZOEY: You do n't want to hear about it . Quinn touches her hand .
QUINN: Please ? Zoey takes a deep breath .
ZOEY: My father , I mentioned him before , was a Baptist minister . He always said he had this `` sickness '' . He begged my mom fo help , it was more important though fo her to having shopping and dinner dates with her girlfriends . Anna , my friend that `` loves you '' , has been in my life since I was tiny . She used to come ove all the time . My Dad adored her . When I was around twelve I found something in the closettapes . My Dad and Anna from the time she was like sevenHe I showed my Mom , and Dadwell he got out of prison when I was seventeen . I do n't see him anymore . His church , even though they knew he had a problem disowned him . He would n't have done that to Anna if my mom would have supported him , got him help .
QUINN: Who do you think is to blame ?
ZOEY: He tried to get help Quinn , he reached out to my Mom . I should have protected Anna tooI mean-
QUINN: -None of this was your fault .
ZOEY: I have to protect people . This was out of my control , you QuinnWhat 's going on with youI have control of that .
QUINN: I love being with you .
ZOEY: Me too .
QUINN: I ca n't renege on my responsibilities with Louis though . Zoey sits up .
ZOEY: You 're not actually going to fight you friend to the death are you ?
QUINN: I know you do n't understand this . We just need to make the most of our time .
ZOEY: Quinn , in 2 days things are going to be normal . This is just a delusion .
QUINN: I know you do n't understand . I just need to go see Louis today .
ZOEY: I understand that .
ZOEY: What is it ?
ZOEY: What was wrong ?
QUINN: My neighbor Ryan Bloodlooks like he 's spying on me .
ZOEY: What are you talking about ?
QUINN: I need to go see Louis .
LOUIS: I thought him admitting his true self would break them up-
RYAN BLOOD: -Instead he is still hot and heavy with her . He even did the `` bipty boom '' last night .
LOUIS: The fight is pointless .
RYAN BLOOD: It 's not pointless . The game has just changed is all . We have two levels here one is making sure we keep him engaged . Honestly though that 's an afterthought at this point-
LOUIS: So what 's the next move ? Ryan reaches into his desk drawer .
RYAN BLOOD: Well when he does become engaged Ryan throws something at Louis .
ANNA: What are you doing ?
ZOEY: I have n't heard from Quinn since he wigged out today .
ANNA: Well honestly maybe that 's a good thing .
ZOEY: He needs me .
ANNA: He does n't need you ! Not everyone needs you !
ZOEY: This is n't about me and you-
ANNA: -This is about me and you ! You think you can make up for what happened . The fact you did n't notice , could n't save me in time . You were a child ! I was a child ! You could n't have saved your fathe either ! Your mother could n't have , no one could have ! He was a fucking pedophile ! Zoey slaps Anna across the face .
JACK: Just show her the fucking file . Jack gets up .
ZOEY: What fucking file ?
QUINN: We have a problem .
LOUIS: You 're right . We do .
RYAN BLOOD: I think it worked out perfectly .
ZOEY: So is the file folder for dramatic effect ?
JACK: No it was to keep everything organized and for dramatic effect . Suddenly Zoey 's cell phon rings . She sets the folder aside and answers .
ZOEY: Quinn ?
QUINN: Ryan Blood !
ZOEY: You mentioned that earlier . What is going on ?
QUINN: He 's with Louis . They 're planning to kill me .
ZOEY: I thought that was the whole plan .
QUINN: No it'sthis is n't like Louis . I think he is trying to cheat his way to a win .
ZOEY: Why do n't you come over here .
QUINN: I ca n't !
ZOEY: Come on Quinn get a grip . Just calm down and come over here .
QUINN: You 're right .
ZOEY: OK so just come on over and we 'll talk .
QUINN: No I mean you 're right . I need to get control of myself . I have a destiny . I need to figure out my next move .
ZOEY: Quinn ? No wait- Quinn hangs up the phone .
JACK: What is it ?
ZOEY: I do n't know . He 's losing it . Jack hands her the folder .
JACK: You need to look at this .
ZOEY: So what is all this ?
JACK: Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were orphans . Zoey is flipping through documents .
ZOEY: You 're not telling me anything I did n't already know .
ANNA: That makes it worse . You 're going to continue this now that you know for a fact that he is nuts ?
ZOEY: I 'm too far into this now . I do n't have a choice .
JACK: Why do n't you let us save you ? Please Zoey .
ZOEY: Let me be guys .
JACK: Ehhhwhat ? You better be a hot bear of a man . Jack looks up and sees Zoey .
ZOEY: What 's this ? Jack 's eyes try to focus on the document .
JACK: Looks like a room list from the psych hospital .
ZOEY: I gathered that . Under Quinn 's room
JACK: Quinn and his roommate is listed .
ZOEY: Quinn 's roommate was Ryan Blood ?
JACK: Yeahlooks that way .
ZOEY: Ah fuck .
RYAN BLOOD: We need to talk . Louis turns around to face Ryan .
LOUIS: About ?
RYAN BLOOD: Strategy .
LOUIS: Strategy ?
RYAN BLOOD: Yes . I have a method-
LOUIS: -I have to hear this .
RYAN BLOOD: A 12 point system-
LOUIS: - Like 12 steps ?
RYAN BLOOD: Exactly . It 's a sure fire plan to throw Quinn off of his game Louis laughs .
LOUIS: Oh I am so all ears .
RYAN BLOOD: Well the first thing you need is a battle cry .
LOUIS: Excuse me ? A battle cry ?
RYAN BLOOD: Yes a battle cry . Every great warrior has one .
LOUIS: And a battle cry is going to give me the advantage in battle ?
RYAN BLOOD: Of course it will . Why do n't you try one out ?
LOUIS: What ?
RYAN BLOOD: Yeah , try one out right now . It 's liberating .
LOUIS: I 'd rather not .
RYAN BLOOD: Come on .
LOUIS: Right here ?
RYAN BLOOD: Here I 'll go first-
LOUIS: That wasinteresting .
RYAN BLOOD: See ? Your turn . Louis looks around .
LOUIS: So right now ?
RYAN BLOOD: Of course .
QUINN: We need to talk .
LOUIS: Excuse me for a second .
QUINN: I know that guy and I do n't trust him .
LOUIS: I do n't trust you anymore .
QUINN: Your new friend is dangerous .
LOUIS: So is yours .
QUINN: Leave her out of this .
LOUIS: You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn ?
QUINN: It 's over . This whole thing is nuts . I 'm walking away .
LOUIS: Let me walk away from you first then .
ZOEY: Excuse me ?
JAKE: Yes .
ZOEY: I 'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes . I believe the people here referred to her as `` mother '' .
JAKE: People look for a lot of things . Zoey is confused .
ZOEY: I 'm sure they do . You guys shutting down ?
JAKE: We are ceasing operations .
ZOEY: Is there something wrong with you ?
MRS. RHODES: Calm down . You need to calm down and count to ten .
ZOEY: What ? I do n't know what that means .
MRS. RHODES: You have to calm down and meditate .
ZOEY: Umnolisten do you know Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks ? They grew up here .
MRS. RHODES: NoYou need to leave !
ZOEY: What ?
MRS. RHODES: And give me your shirt .
ZOEY: Umno .
MRS. RHODES: You better make your peace with God girl ! The end is coming , those boys are ushering in a new era !
ZOEY: What a fucking nut house !
JAKE: I know the young boys you speak of .
ZOEY: And ?
JAKE: I was here when Quinn got sent to the mental hospital . It was like the othe one set it up .
ZOEY: Wait Louis ? You think Louis made Quinn appear crazy ?
JAKE: They both believed the same thing . Louis was just smart enough to hide it .
ZOEY: There is more to it than that .
JAKE: I do n't understand
ZOEY: Listen `` Robot Boy '' , where did this whole elief come from ? This is n't something two kids come up with on their own .
JAKE: Yes I believe a seed was planted .
ZOEY: Exactly . I heard there was an employee that got fired for sharing Mormon mythology with the boys .
JAKE: No . Off base . He 's not the right one .
JACK: You might be right sweetheart . The employee I was telling you about earlie was instrumental in getting Appleridge Orphanage shut down .
ZOEY: How ?
JACK: Mrs. Rhodes was pretty well known in Huntington . I think she felt this guy was getting in the way of her master plan . Finally , nearly 20 years later , he convinced the state what was really going on there .
ZOEY: Wellelaborate .
JACK: That girl you talked to was `` pants crapping nuts '' . She actually makes you oyfriend look sane . I guess she believes that Lucifer came to her in a vision-
ZOEY: -How is that different than a dream ? Just saying-
JACK: -I do n't know . I think you have to be awake for a vision . Will you please pay attention ? Anyway he , meaning Lucifer , gave her this jazz aboutwell you know the story . Two angels , fighting to the deathblahblahAnyway he told he she needed to look after Louis and get Quinn out of there . I guess trying to stack the odds in Louis ' favor .
ZOEY: So she had Quinn committed ?
JACK: To the same hospital where her nephew was a patient . All on the dark lord 's orders I guess .
ZOEY: Fucking Ryan Blood !
JACK: Your friends are fucking whack .
ZOEY: Thanks Jack .
JACK: So what are you going to do ?
ZOEY: I 'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle .
JACK: Goddamn Zoey !
ANNA: So where is she at now ? Jack sits up .
JACK: I got a text about thirty minutes ago . I 'm pretty sure she is going to head to Quinn 's apartment .
ANNA: Jack
JACK: What ?
ANNA: Her Christ Complex is going to get he killed .
JACK: Trust me I know Anna . I know
RYAN BLOOD: Good afternoon boys and girls ! I need your assistance .
QUINN: How do people keep ending up in my room ?
ZOEY: You need to learn to lock up .
QUINN: I 'm not fighting Louis .
ZOEY: Why the change of heart ?
QUINN: I think you might be right . I do n't think it 's necessary . I think the world will keep turning one way or another . I 'm not dependant on that . I 'm not a savior .
ZOEY: Do you really believe ? You know ?
QUINN: Yes . I do believe it . I know it actually . Since I have been with you , I 've doubted what I know to be fact though . Then it hit me , it really does n't matter .
ZOEY: I 'll help you Quinn . I do n't want to do it for myself
QUINN: You 're not selfish Zoey .
ZOEY: I care about you Quinn . That 's sincerely my reason for wanting to do this . That 's a first for me you know ?
QUINN: I know
RYAN BLOOD: Let me pretty the girl up a bit
LOUIS: Hold on sunshine !
JACK: Mother fucker !
QUINN: Where 's Zoey ?
JACK: Fuck you mother fucker ! I 'm going to call the fucking fuzz once you untie me ! Fucking nut bag , ball sac-
QUINN: Iwillcomerescueyou
JACK: Ass fuck salad-
QUINN: That actually felt kind of good . Quinn pats Jack on the head .
ZOEY: I 'm not doing it anymore . You will not have redemption from me .
DAD: Zoey
ZOEY: Take ownership of what you did . Do n't ely on me to save you . I need to start saving myself .
LOUIS: What do you think Zoey ? I 'm a ninja !
ZOEY: You 're fucking crazy !
LOUIS: That 's not nice ! I think I look good .
ZOEY: I think you 're a fucking nut bag .
LOUIS: This is going to be fun . You 'll see .
ZOEY: Mrs Rhodes ? Does that name ring a bell ?
RYAN BLOOD: My aunt ?
LOUIS: Yeahyeahshe played a part in the game . Tell us something we do n't know . You 're such a sexy Nancy Drew right now .
ZOEY: Go fuck yourself .
LOUIS: Or a foul mouthed Velma . That gets me so hard . Does that get you hard Ryan ?
RYAN BLOOD: Can we go back to my aunt please ?
ZOEY: Mrs. Rhodes ? What about her ? Other than she fucked you guys up . She taught you , Louis how to play it straight . Then she has you fuck Quinn over .
RYAN BLOOD: She did n't fuck Quinn over . She just helped him out .
ZOEY: Yeah by getting him in contact with you .
RYAN BLOOD: She knew one day it was all going to catch up with her . She trained me to get into the game . She told me it was my destiny .
ZOEY: Is that why she placed you in that hospital ?
RYAN BLOOD: She was my caretaker . She told me she was sending me someone . Someone I would have to guide on to the right path .
ZOEY: Guys I have let my parents fuck me up . There comes a time though where you have to go out on your own . Take esponsibility for your own life .
RYAN BLOOD: There is a much bigger purpose . You 'll see .
ZOEY: This whole thing was to carry out some delusional woman 's master plan . She does n't even remember who she is at this point . I went to see hershe wanted me to take off my shirt . Louis is irritated .
LOUIS: Will you shut up ? ! ? You are ruining my climatic fight . Louis spies Quinn in the distance .
QUINN: Let her go ! Ryan grabs her tighter .
RYAN BLOOD: Not yet
QUINN: Is this the game you want to play ?
LOUIS: I 'm not going to lose this time .
ZOEY: I thought you did n't believe this shit anymore .
QUINN: There 's more going on than you realize Zoey .
ZOEY: This is fucked . Quinn you 're not 5000 years old . You were born in an orphanage . None of this makes sense .
LOUIS: Lady , it would look weird if we roamed the earth for 5000 years without facing a mortal death ! We keep getting reborn , sometimes we even switch physical form . Thanks for coming to the game late missy !
ZOEY: That makes total fucking sense . Color me stupid !
QUINN: You do n't get it do you .
LOUIS: What ? ! ?
QUINN: If you winyou 're not becoming the antichrist .
LOUIS: What are you talking about ? ?
QUINN: It 's Ryanit 's always been Ryan .
LOUIS: What is he talking about ?
RYAN BLOOD: He 's pitting us against each other .
QUINN: I 'm going to be honest with you Louis . I 've always been honest .
LOUIS: Yeah sometimes to a fault .
QUINN: We have always played this game as honest as we could . We never did anything to undermine the other . Despite what you epresent , you have moral code . You are not acting with in that code today .
LOUIS: I 'm tired of losing
QUINN: You 're losing right now . Your actions , you ca n't win like this . Not acting this way .
LOUIS: I 'm tired of you . I 'm going to end it !
QUINN: You going to shoot me ?
LOUIS: It 's the endgame . Tense moment as Louis aims the gun at Quinn .
ZOEY: What the fuck !
QUINN: Zoey go home . We need to finish this .
ZOEY: No you do n't . Guys what are you doing ?
LOUIS: Go home girl !
ZOEY: Are you being serious ? Quinn stops and turns toward Zoey .
QUINN: I will always love you . You have to go though .
ZOEY: If you do n't walk away from this field ight now , you will lose me . I will not e in your corner . I will call for help . They will stop you .
QUINN: Go
ZOEY: Quinnlast chance .
QUINN: Goodbye .
ZOEY: Wowyeah goodbye .
ZOEY: I am Curious Yellow Goodbye boys
ZOEY: For years we have thought absence of the impossible indicated that we were exercising free thought . In my experience ladies and gentleman , that 's not the case . Believing in hope my friends , opening yourself up to accepting there might be more than the world around you . That 's truly being a free thinker .
JENNIFER: Hey Grandma .
ZOEY: Hey
JENNIFER: You look solemn .

JENNIFER: What are you thinking about ?
ZOEY: I 've had a great life . A wonderful husband , children , grandchildren great grandchildrenI spent so much of my youth being angry . I wish I could elive my life now , knowing what I know .

LUCY: if you do n't mind my askingwhat are you ?
TUMNUS: Why , I 'm a faun ! And you must be some eardless dwarf ?
LUCY: I 'm not a dwarf , I 'm a girl ! And actually I 'm tallest in my class .
TUMNUS: But you 're saying , you 're a daughte of Eve ?
LUCY: Well , my mum 's name is Helen
TUMNUS: Yes , but you are , in fact , human .
LUCY: Of course .
TUMNUS: What are you doing here ?
LUCY: Well , I came in through the wardrobe in the spare room , and-
TUMNUS: Spare Oom , is that in Narnia ?
LUCY: Narnia ? What 's that ?
TUMNUS: My dear girl , you 're in it ! Everything from the lamp post , all the way to castle Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea , every stick and stone , every icicle , is Narnia ,
LUCY: This is an awfully big wardrobe
TUMNUS: I 'm sorry , please allow me to introduce myself , my name is Tumnus
LUCY: Glad to meet you , Mr. Tumnus ! *extends hand* I 'm Lucy Pevensie . Oh , you shake it !
TUMNUS: Why ?
LUCY: I-I do n't know ! People do it when they meet each other .
TUMNUS: Lucy Pevensie , from the shining city of War Drobe in the far land of Spare Oom , how would it be if you came and had tea with me ?
LUCY: Oh ! Well , thank you very much ! But I probably should be getting back
TUMNUS: Oh , come on ! It 's not every day I get to make a new friend ! And there 's a oaring fire ! And toast and cakes ! And maybe we 'll even break into the sardines .
LUCY: Well , maybe for just a little while if you have sardines .
TUMNUS: By the bucket load ,
LUCY: Can I help you with that ?
TUMNUS: Why thank you ! Lucy looks at the picture .
LUCY: He had a nice face . You look just like him .
TUMNUS: No , were not alike at all really .
LUCY: My father is fighting in the war .
TUMNUS: My father went away to war too but that was a very long time ago before this dreadful winter .
LUCY: Winter is n't all bad . There 's ice skating and snow ball fights . Oh ! And Christmas !
TUMNUS: We have n't had Christmas in a hundred years here .
LUCY: No presents for a hundred years ?
TUMNUS: But , oh , you would have loved Narnia in spring ! The Dryads and the Fauns would dance all night but we neve got tired . And oh , the music ! Such music . Would you like to hear some now ?
LUCY: yes please
TUMNUS: Now , are you familia with the Narnia lullabies ?
LUCY: No , I 'm afraid I 'm not
TUMNUS: Good , because this probably wo n't sound anything like one .
LUCY: Oh I must go
TUMNUS: It 's too late for that now I 'm such a bad faun
LUCY: No . You 're the nicest faun I 've eve met .
TUMNUS: Then I 'm afraid you 've had a very poo sampling .
LUCY: I 'm sure you 're very sorry , and you 'll never do it again .
TUMNUS: It 's not something I have done , Lucy Pevensie . It 's something I 'm doing .
LUCY: What are you doing ?
TUMNUS: I 'm kidnapping you . It 's the White Witch , the one that makes it always winter , and never Christmas . She told me that I If I ever was to come across a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve , I am supposed to turn it over to her !
LUCY: But I thought you were my friend
TUMNUS: We must move quietly the woods are full of her spies , even some of the trees are on her side
LUCY: I think so . Keep it , you need it more than I do .
MR. TUMNUS: Go Come on , go !
PETER: 98 , 99 , 100 Ready or not here I come .
LUCY: I 'm back , I 'm back , it 's alright ,
EDMUND: Shhh , he 's coming .
PETER: You know , I 'm not sure if you two have quite gotten the idea of this game !
LUCY: but were n't you wondering where I was ?
EDMUND: That 's the point ! That 's why he was seeking you !
SUSAN: Does this mean I win ?
PETER: I do n't think Lucy wants to play anymore .
SUSAN: The only wood in here is the back of the wardrobe .
PETER: One game at a time Lu , we do n't all have your imagination .
LUCY: But I was n't imagining !
SUSAN: that 's enough
EDMUND: Well I believe you .
LUCY: You do ?
EDMUND: Yah , did n't I tell you about the football field I found in the bathroom closet ?
PETER: Why do n't you just stop it , you always have to make everything worse . Grow up !
EDMUND: Shut up ! You think you 're dad , but you 're not !
SUSAN: well , that was nicely handled !
LUCY: It was really there
PETER: Susan 's right . That 's enough..
EDMUND: Lucy , Lucy . I hope you 're not afraid of the dark
DWARF: Yah !
WHITE WITCH: What is it Ginarrbrik ?
EDMUND: He wo n't let go !
DWARF: Is that how you address the Queen of Narnia ?
EDMUND: I did n't know ?
DWARF: Well , you shall know her better afterwards .
WHITE WITCH: Wait ! What is your name Son-of-Adam ?
EDMUND: Edmund , your majesty .
WHITE WITCH: And how was it , Edmund , that you came to enter my dominion ?
EDMUND: I walked through a wardrobe following my sister .
WHITE WITCH: Your sister ? How many are you ?
EDMUND: fou
WHITE WITCH: Edmund you look so cold ! Come and sit with me here on my sledge . Now , would like something warm to drink .
EDMUND: Yesyour majesty . How did you do that ?
WHITE WITCH: I can make anything you like .
EDMUND: Could you make me taller ?
WHITE WITCH: I can make anything you like to eat
EDMUND: Turkish Delight
WHITE WITCH: I 'd love to see your family
EDMUND: They 're nothing special
WHITE WITCH: I have no children of my own and you are such a good little boy where I could see , one day , you becoming prince of Narnia - maybe even king .
EDMUND: Really ?
WHITE WITCH: Of course you 'd have to bring your family .
EDMUND: They 're nothing special
WHITE WITCH: No ! But a king needs servants .
EDMUND: I-I guess I could bring 'em .
WHITE WITCH: Beyond these woods , do you see those two little hills ? My house is right etween them . You 'd love it there Edmund , it has whole rooms simply stuffed with Turkish Delight !
EDMUND: Could n't I have some more now ?
WHITE WITCH: NO ! Do n't want to ruin you appetite .
EDMUND: I hope so .
WHITE WITCH: Until thendear one .
LUCY: Edmund ? Oh Edmund ! ! ! ! I saw Mr. Tumnus again and he 's fine ! ! ! The White Witch has n't found out about him helping me !
EDMUND: The White Witch ?
LUCY: She calls herself the Queen of Narnia , ut she really is n't . Edmund ? Are you okay ? You look awful .
EDMUND: Well what do you expect ! It 's freezing ! How do we get out of here ?
LUCY: Come onthis way .
PETER: Lucy , what are talking about ?
LUCY: Narnia ! It 's all in the wardrobe , like I told you !
SUSAN: Oh Lucy , you 've been dreaming .
LUCY: No I was n't , I saw Mr. Tumnus again ! Oh , and this time - Edmund went too .
PETER: You saw the faun ?
LUCY: Well , he did n't actually go there with me . What were you doing Edmund ?
EDMUND: I-I was just playing along . You know what little children are like these days , they just do n't know when to stop pretending
MRS. MACREADY: You children are one shenanigan shy of sleeping ' in the stable- oh , Professor ! I told them you were not to be disturbed .
PROFESSOR: Oh , it 's alright Mrs. Macready - I 'm sure there 's a logical explanation . But I think this one needs some hot chocolate .
MRS. MACREADY: Yes Professor . Come on , dear .
PROFESSOR: *Ahem*
PETER: We are very sorry sir , it wo n't happen again .
SUSAN: It 's our sister sir , Lucy .
PROF: The weeping girl ?
SUSAN: Yes sir , she 's upset .
PROFESSOR: Hence the weeping
PETER: We can handle it !
PROFESSOR: Oh , I can see that .
SUSAN: She thinks she 's found a magical land in the upstairs wardrobe .
PROFESSOR: What did you say ! ?
PETER: The wardrobe upstairs , Lucy thinks she 's found a forest inside .
PROFESSOR: What was it like ?
SUSAN: Like talking to a lunatic !
PROFESSOR: No , not her - the forest !
PETER: You're-you 're not saying you believe her ?
PROFESSOR: No , not her - the forest !
PETER: You.you actually believe her ?
PROFESSOR: Well do n't you ?
SUSAN: Well , logically it could n't possibly e there !
PROFESSOR: What do they teach at these schools ?
PETER: Edmund said they were only pretending
PROFESSOR: And he 's the more truthful one is he ?
PETER: No , this would be the first time .
PROFESSOR: Well then , id your sister is n't lying and is n't mad then logically we must assume that she is telling the truth . She 's your sister , is n't she ? You 're a family ! It 's high time you start acting like one !
PETER: Peter winds up , goes for the bowl !
EDMUND: Ow !
PETER: Whoops ! Wake up , Dolly Daydream !
EDMUND: Ca n't we play hide and go seek again ?
PETER: I thought you said that it was a kid 's game .
SUSAN: Besides , we can all use the fresh air .
EDMUND: Not like there 's air inside
PETER: Are you ready then ?
EDMUND: Are you ?
PETER: Well done , Ed !
EDMUND: You bowled it !
SUSAN: Listen , Mrs. Macready is coming
PETER: Run !
EDMUND: Come on !
SUSAN: You have got to be joking .
PETER: Go !
SUSAN: Get back !
SUSAN: Impossible !
LUCY: Do n't worry , it 's probably just you imagination
PETER: I do n't suppose saying we 're sorry would quite cover it ?
LUCY: No , it would n't . But this might !
EDMUND: Ow ! Stop it !
PETER: You little liar !
EDMUND: You did n't believe her either !
PETER: Apologize to Lucy .
EDMUND: Alright ! I 'm sorry .
LUCY: That 's alright , some little children just do n't know when to stop pretending .
EDMUND: Very funny .
SUSAN: Maybe we should go back
EDMUND: Ca n't we at lease take a look around ?
PETER: I think Lucy must decide !
LUCY: I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus !
PETER: Well Mr. Tumnus it is
SUSAN: We ca n't just walk around in these clothes !
PETER: We can use these coats .
SUSAN: Peter , they do n't belong to us .
PETER: Well I do n't think the professor will mind . And if you think about it logically we are not even taking them out of the wardrobe .
EDMUND: But that 's a girl 's coat !
PETER: I know .
PETER: LUCY !
LUCY: Who would do something like this ?
SUSAN: Peter what is that on the wall ?
PETER READS: The Former occupant of these premises , the Faun Tumnus , is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her imperial Majesty Jadis , Queen of Narnia , Chatelaine of Cair Paravel , Empress of the Lone Islands , also to comforting her said Majesty 's enemies , harbouring spies and fraternizing with Humans . signed Maugrim , captain of the Secret Police , Long live the Queen .
SUSAN: Now we should really go .
LUCY: But we have to help him !
PETER: It 's out of our hands now Lu .
LUCY: You do n't get it do you ? I 'm the human ! ! ! He helped ME !
PETER: Maybe we should call the police
SUSAN: These are the police !
EDMUND: Besides , he 's a criminal !
PETER: Do n't worry Lucy , we 'll think of something
ROBIN: Psst !
SUSAN: Did that bird just 'psst ' us ?
LUCY: It 's a beaver .
PETER: Here , boy *clicks* come here*clicks*
MR.BEAVER: Well , I ai n't gon na smell it if that 's what you want !
EDMUND: It 's a talking beaver !
MR.BEAVER: Lucy Pevensie ?
LUCY: Yes ? Mr. Beaver hands her the handkerchief
MR. BEAVER: Tumnus . He gave it to me just before they took him .
LUCY: Is he alright ?
MR. BEAVER: Further in .
SUSAN: Peter , we do n't know what you are doing .
EDMUND: She 's right . How do we know we can trust this beaver ?
PETER: He say 's he knows the faun .
SUSAN: He 's a beaverhe should n't be saying anything !
MR. BEAVER: Is everything alright ?
PETER: Yes . We were just talking
MR. BEAVER: That 's better left for safer corners .
LUCY: He means the trees .
MR. BEAVER: There is home sweet home .
LUCY: Oh , what a beautiful dam Mr. Beaver .
MR. BEAVER: Merely a trifle .
MRS. BEAVER: Is that you Beaver ? I find out you 've een out with Badger again I'llOh , they 're not Badgers . I never thought I would see this day
MR. BEAVER: I would have given you a week if I thought it would help
MRS. BEAVER: Well you must be cold and hungry . Let 's get you inside for some food and civilized conversation .
MR. BEAVER: Enjoying the scenery , are we ?
MRS. BEAVER: Fish and sticks , dear .
PETER: is there nothing we can do about Mr. Tumnus ?
MRS. BEAVER: well.. there 's hope !
MR. BEAVER: Yeah , there 's a load full of hope Aslan is on the move .
EDMUND: Who 's Aslan ?
MR. BEAVER: Aslan.you silly little blighter..you do n't know do you ?
PETER: Well we have n't actually been here very long
MR. BEAVER: He 's only the king the whole wood , the true king of Narnia . and he 's waiting for you !
LUCY: waiting for us ?
BEAVER: You got to be joking ! Look , Aslan 's eturn , Tumnus ' arrest..the secret police ! They 're all happening because of you !
SUSAN: You 're blaming us ?
MRS. BEAVER: Not blaming you dear , thanking you .
BEAVER: There's.a prophecy , When Adam 's flesh and Adam 's bone sits in if Cair Paravel in throne the evil is over and done .
SUSAN: You know that does n't really rhyme .
MR. BEAVER: I know , but you 're missing the point !
MRS. BEAVER: It 's long been told that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will appea to defeat the White Witch , and restore peace to Narnia .
PETER: And you think we 're the ones ? ? ?
MR. BEAVER: Well you 'd better be , Aslan 's already fitted out your army ! ! !
PETER: I think you 've made a mistake ; we 're not heroes !
SUSAN: We 're from Finchley !
PETER: I think it 's time we were going .
LUCY: But what about Mr. Tumnus ?
PETER: Sorry Lucy . It 's out of our hands .
SUSAN: Thank you for your hospitality .
PETER: Ed , time to go- Ed ? I 'm going to kill him .

PETER: Get off me !
BEAVER: Do n't you get it ? ! He 's the bait ! She wants all of ya in there ! ! ! To kill ya !
SUSAN: This is all your fault ! None of this would have happened if you had just listened to me in the first place !
PETER: So you knew this would happen ?
SUSAN: I did n't know what would happen
LUCY: Stop , this fighting is n't going to help Edmund
BEAVER: She 's right . Only Aslan can save him now .
PETER: Then take us to him .
MAUGRIM: Stand still stranger !
EDMUND: I 'm a Son of Adam , I met the Queen in the woods !
MAUGRIM: My apologies , fortunate favourite of the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate .
WHITE WITCH: You like it !

BEAVER: I 'M CRANKY NOW !
SUSAN: Do you think we should bring jam ?
PETER: Only if the Witch has toast .
MR. BEAVER: This should lead to Aslan 's
MRS. BEAVER: I thought it lead to your mums ! Lucy falls howling .
LUCY: They 're in the tunnel !
MRS. BEAVER: You should have brought a map !
BEAVER: There was no room next to the jam !
MR. BEAVER: He was my best mate !
SUSAN: What happened to them ?
FOX: This is what happens to the enemies of the White Witch .
MR. BEAVER: Stand still there traitor .
FOX: Relax , I 'm one of the good guys
MR. BEAVER: Well you look mighty like one of the ad guys .
FOX: An unfortunate family resemblance , but we can discuss family breeding late ight now we need to move .

WHITE WITCH: Then you will know that the boy belongs to me . That boy will die on the Stone Table .
PETER: Come and take it then .

SUSAN: We should go .
LUCY: I 'm so cold . They start walking awayStone Table cracks
SUSAN: What have they done ?
ASLAN: If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice , she might have interpreted the Deep Magic a little differently . For she would know that if a willing victim who had committed no treachery died in a traitors stead , the Stone Table would crack and death itself would egin to unwind .
SUSAN: We sent the word that you were dead . Peter and Edmund would have gone to war .
LUCY: We have to help them .

PROFESSOR: I do n't think you 'll get back in that wayyou see I 've already tried .
LUCY: Will we ever go back ?
PROFESSOR: I expect so , probably when you least expect it . What 's to say Keep your eyes open
LARCH: I named him after the Greek writer . You know Homer , of course ?
ADOPTING MOTHER: There 's something wrong with him ! He never makes a sound . Larch looks quickly at Homer .
ADOPTING FATHER: Do you think we could have a look at someone a little different ?
HOMER: Do n't be frightened . Everyone is nice here .
PREGNANT WOMAN: Do you live here ?
HOMER: I just belong here .
LARCH: Homer , if you 're going to stay at St . Cloud 's , I expect you to be of use .
HOMER: Dr. Larch ! Dr. Larch !
LARCH: First pregnancy ?
HOMER: Yes , for both .
LARCH: I presume you 'd prefer handling the delivery .
HOMER: All I said was , I do n't want to perform abortions . I have no argument with *you* performing them .
LARCH: You know *how* to help these women how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they ca n't get help anywhere else ?
HOMER: One it 's illegal . Two I did n't ask how to do ityou just showed me .
LARCH: What *else* could I have showed you , Homer ? The only thing I can teach you is what I know ! In every life , you 've got to be of use .
DOROTHY: Once , when they took out my appendix .
ANGELA: No one 's touched your appendix .
DOROTHY: Whatever it was the ether made me sick .
LARCH: It wo n't make you sick this time , Dorothynot the way I do it , just a drop at a time .
DOROTHY: I ca n't pay for this , you knowI got no money .
LARCH: One day , Dorothy , if you have any money , a donation to the orphanage would be very much appreciated .
ANGELA: Only if you can afford it .
LARCH: Try to think of nothing , Dorothy .
HOMER: That was good , Carlathat was *perfect* . Everything 's fine .
CARLA: I do n't wan na see it !
EDNA: You do n't have to see it , dear . Do n't worry .
CARLA: I do n't even wan na know what sex it isdo n't tell me !
HOMER: We wo n't tell you , Carla . You 're going to be okay .
EDNA: Your *baby's* going to be okay , too .
CARLA: I do n't wan na know !
LARCH: He 's a big boy !
CARLA: Let me see him , for Christ 's sakeI wan na see him .
LARCH: Would you mind having a look at Dorothy ?
HOMER: There was no visible wound ?
LARCH: No . The fetus was dead . Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*my stitches pulled right through the tissue !
HOMER: It looks like scurvy .
LARCH: Scurvy ! Ah yes , the curse of the old- time sailor , suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits o vegetables . Homer , Dorothy is n't a *sailor* !
ANGELA: She 's a prostitute , is n't she ?
HOMER: Did you look in her purse ?
LARCH: I looked everywhere else ! Angela hands Larch a bottle of brown liquid .
ANGELA: It 's called French Lunar Solution . Larch wrinkles his nose at the odor .
LARCH: It 's not ergot , it 's not pituitary extract , it 's not oil of rue
ANGELA: It claims to restore monthly egularity .
HOMER: It 's obviously an aborticide .
LARCH: Obviously .
HOMER: I do n't know it .
LARCH: If you take enough of it , you intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C .
HOMER: In other words , scurvy .
LARCH: Good boy . Good job . And you call yourself `` not a doctor '' ! Keep an eye on hershe 's in trouble .
BUSTER: I 'll help you .
HOMER: It 's because he 's too tired to sleep . He has to .
BUSTER: He *smells* like he could put you to sleep !
HOMER: He 's a doctor , Busterdoctors smell like ether .
BUSTER: *You're* a doctor , Homeryou do n't smell like ether .
HOMER: I 'm *not* a doctor . I have n't been to medical schoolI have n't even een to high school !
BUSTER: But you 've studied with the old man for *years* !
HOMER: I 'm *not* a doctor !
BUSTER: I 'm sorry , Homer .
LARCH: Fuzzy is not uncommon . I tell you , there 's something about the premature abies of alcoholic mothers . They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along .
HOMER: I have n't read that .
LARCH: I have n't , either . But you *will* . The morons who write the books should do a little research *here* .
HOMER: But is n't Fuzzy just well , underdeveloped ?
LARCH: When *doesn't* he have bronchitis ? I would n't call his bronchial infections `` underdeveloped . '' Would you ?
HOMER: What is it , Mary Agnes ?
MARY AGNES: Look ! Homer examines Mary Agnes ' tongue .
HOMER: Did you bite it ?
MARY AGNES: I do n't remember .
HOMER: It looks like you bit itit 'll be all right .
MARY AGNES: Maybe I was kissing someone and he it me .
HOMER: No , you did it yourself . Maybe in your sleep .
MARY AGNES: I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone .
HOMER: Story time , Fuzzy !
EDNA: `` Oh Lord , support us all the day long ''
LARCH: `` A dog , which had lain concealed till now , ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl , and collecting himself for a spring , jumped for the dead man 's shoulders . ''
FUZZY: Why does Dr. Larch *do* tht every night ?
CURLY: Maybe to scare us
COPPERFIELD: No , you jerk .
STEERFORTH: Dr. Larch *loves* us !
FUZZY: But why does he do *that* ?
BUSTER: He does it because we like it . The boys silently agree , Homer among them .
MARY AGNES: Buster is mine . You two get Copperfield and Curly . Nobody touches Fuzzy .
EDNA: Stop it ! No fighting ! *Share* the snowballs !
BUSTER: They 're *our* snowballs ! They *stole* them !
MARY AGNES: They attacked usjust like the Japs !
EDNA: Listen to you , Fuzzy ! You 've been unning . You get to the shower !
MARY AGNES: I know the typethey 'll take one of the babies .
ANGELA: Wilbur , the adopting couple is waiting in your office .
LARCH: Life is waiting .
HOMER: Nobody 's named this one yet .
LARCH: It 's my turn !
HOMER: He does n't like it . He 's a boy , That 's why .
LARCH: Ca n't a boy be a Dorrit ?
HOMER: I do n't think so .
LARCH: You do it then .
HOMER: Henceforth you shall be Little Wilbur .
LARCH: I 'm not crazy about the `` Little '' Homer is writing the name .
HOMER: Okay , he 's just a Wilbur then .
LARCH: We have n't had a Wilbur here in a year or so , have we ? We used to have *dozens* !
COPPERFIELD: They picked Hazel ! The idiots chose Hazel !
MARY AGNES: If people want to adopt one of us , they should have to take the oldest first .
EDNA: Please , Mary Agnes ! This is Hazel 's special daydo n't make her feel sad .
MARY AGNES: Hazel 's practically the youngest of us . She should be the *last* to leave !
CLARA: At least Hazel can talk . Usually they take one of the stupid babies .
MARY AGNES: They take the babies so they wo n't ever have to tell them that they were orphans !
HAZEL: I 'm not a baby !
MARY AGNES: If you cry , Hazel , they 'll just send you back .
EDNA: Mary Agnes , that 's not true ! Hazel cries harder .
MARY AGNES: That 's what they did to me !
EDNA: You *wanted* to come backthat 's why you cried . You can cry if you feel like it , Hazel . You cry as much as you want .
LARCH: It is strictly for our orphans ' sake that I destroy any record of thei natural mothers . Of course they will , one day , want to know . But orphans , especially , should look forward to their *futures* . Not back to thei pasts .
HOMER: Hi , Curly . You going somewhere ? Curly shakes his head .
CURLY: I thought they might take me .
HOMER: They wanted a girl .
CURLY: Nobody ever wants me !
HOMER: You 're one of the best , Curlywe could n't let just anyone take you .
CURLY: Dr. Larch would n't let just anyone take *any* of us !
HOMER: That 's true .
CURLY: Nobody 's asked for me , have they ?
HOMER: Nobody special enough , Curly .
CURLY: You mean somebody asked ?
HOMER: Only the right people can have you , Curly .
EDNA: Let us be happy for Hazel . Hazel has found a family . Good night , Hazel .
THE GIRLS: Good night , Hazel ! Good night , Hazel ! Good night , Hazel !
LARCH: I was dreaming about you . How eautiful you were !
ANGELA: You were n't dreaming about me .
LARCH: I was ! Playfully , she slips out of his embrace .
ANGELA: Then I was n't beautiful .
LARCH: You were ! You *are* ! It was fantastic .
ANGELA: It was just the ether , Wilbur
HOMER: Are you okay ? Can I get you anything ?
DISTRAUGHT WOMAN: No one but me ever put a hand on me , to feel that baby . Do n't you want to touch it or put your ear down to it ?
HOMER: Okay . Homer touches the woman 's belly .
DISTRAUGHT WOMAN: Put your ear there . Go on .
BUSTER: Do you ever think about leaving this place to go find them ?
HOMER: I know who you mean . I think about leaving here , but not to find *them* .
BUSTER: Why not ?
HOMER: Whoever they were , they did n't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do . Dr. Larch did those things , and Nurse Edna , and Nurse Angela .
BUSTER: Yeah . But sometimes I wish I could meet mine , anyway .
HOMER: What for , Buster ? What would you do if you met them ?
BUSTER: Uh I 'd like to show them that I can cook , a little .
HOMER: You cook very well !
BUSTER: And that I can drive a truck !
HOMER: Better than I can !
BUSTER: Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them . Just sometimes .
HOMER: I know .
BUSTER: I think Mary Agnes could kill someone .
HOMER: I doubt it . She 's just an Mary Agnes spits at *all* the soldiers .
BUSTER: What 's she so emotional about ?
HOMER: I do n't know . She got left here , like the rest of us , did n't she ? Camera closes on Homer .
FUZZY: He thinks she 's his *mother* ! King Kong is undressing Fay Wray in the cave .
COPPERFIELD: He does n't think she 's his mother , Fuzzy .
FUZZY: He does so ! He *loves* her !
CARLA: How could she be his *mother* ? Larch shakes the letter in front of Angela .
LARCH: They want to replace me ! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me !
ANGELA: They just want you to hire some new help .
LARCH: Some new *things* would be useful . I do n't need any `` new help . ''
HOMER: It 's *your* splice ! You blame me fo everything ! Larch abruptly lets go of the film .
LARCH: Angela , we need a new movie , a new projector , a new typewriter*that's* what they should replace around here !
EDNA: We have a delivery . Imminent , in my estimation Larch turns to Homer .
LARCH: Homer , would you get this one ?
HOMER: She 's a patient , right ? She should see a doctor . Homer and Larch stare at each other .
LARCH: Homer , you are a skilled and gifted surgeon . You have near-prefect obstetrical and gynecological procedure . Homer is also trying to avoid a fight .
HOMER: I just mean I 'd rather fix the movie . Tonight . Larch ca n't hide his disappointment .
LARCH: Sure . Okay . You splice . I 'll deliver . It is an uneasy peace .
FUZZY: Homer does n't King Kong think the woman is his *mother* ?
HOMER: Uh , surethat 's what Kong thinks , all right .
FUZZY: That 's why Kong loves her !
HOMER: I thought it was my turn .
LARCH: It is . I 'll get this . You go ahead .
HOMER: `` Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life , or whether that station will be held by anybody else , these pages must show . ''
FUZZY: His father 's dead , right ?
LARCH: That 's right , Fuzz . Close on Fuzzy .
FUZZY: Is *your* father dead ?
LARCH: Cirrhosisit 's a disease of the liver .
FUZZY: *Liver* killed him ?
LARCH: *Alcohol* killed himhe drank himself to death .
FUZZY: But did you know him ?
LARCH: Barely . It hardly mattered that I knew him .
FUZZY: Did you know your mother better ?
LARCH: She 's dead now , too . She was a nanny .
FUZZY: What 's a nanny do ?
LARCH: She looks after other people 's children .
FUZZY: Did you grow up around here ?
LARCH: No . She was an immigrant .
FUZZY: What 's an immigrant ?
LARCH: Someone not from Maine .
EDNA: No one 's going to hurt you , dear . Have you come to visit us ? We have eds , you know . Have you had any eakfast ? What 's your name ?
LARCH: How old are you , dear ? Thirteen ?
HOMER: She 's at least *five* .
LARCH: Dear child , it wo n't hurt when I look . I 'm just going to *look* . Homer assists Larch with the speculum .
HOMER: Stuck *what* inside you ?
LARCH: Listen , you 've been very brave . I 'm going to put you to sleepyou wo n't feel it anymore . You 've been brave enough .
EDNA: That 's a heavy sedation .
LARCH: You *bet* it 's a heavy sedation ! The fetus is unexpelled , her uterus is punctured , she has acute peritonitis , and there 's a foreign object . I think it 's a crochet hook .
BUSTER: What 'd she die of ?
LARCH: She died of *secrecy* , she died of *ignorance* Buster nods , but he 's totally bewildered .
HOMER: How about expecting people to be esponsible enough to control themselves to begin with ?
LARCH: How about this child ? You expect *her* to be responsible ? Homer looks away .
HOMER: I did n't mean her . I 'm talking about adults . You know who I mean ! Larch studies him .
LARCH: It 's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people .
HOMER: I 'm happy I amuse you .
LARCH: Try to look at it this way . What choice does Buster have ? What are his options ? Nobody will ever adopt him .
HOMER: Try to look at it *this* way . Buste and I are sitting right here beside you . We could have ended up in the incinerator !
LARCH: Happy to be alive , under any circumstancesis that your point ?
HOMER: Happy to be alive I guess so .
CANDY: So many children . Are they all orphans ?
WALLY: Well , this *is* an orphanage . The kids climb into Wally 's car .
CANDY: Oh , they 're getting into the car watch your fingers !
CURLY: I 'm the best .
CANDY: You are ?
WALLY: The best ? Wow ! The best at *what* ?
CURLY: I 'm the best one .
CANDY: Here , blow
CURLY: I really *am* the best , I just have a cold .
CANDY: Blow ! There , I bet that feels better .
CURLY: Yeah .
LARCH: Curly , come here !
CURLY: *Tell* them ! I 'm the one .
HOMER: I 'm sorry . They 're not used to seeing a car like this .
WALLY: It 's okayI do n't mind .
LARCH: Chocolates . How *thoughtful* .
CURLY: I 'm the best ! *Tell* them !
LARCH: You 're the best , Curly .
HOMER: So , Mrs

WALLY: Ah , well okay . Good ! I just wondered Edna pokes her head in the door .
EDNA: Excuse me , Homer . Dr. Larch said this one is your turn .
HOMER: Sure . Fine . Have you prepped him ?
EDNA: I 'll get started .
WALLY: I think it was the etherthe smell got to me . God . This is all my fault .
EDNA: Steerforth got into the pantryhe 's eaten all the pie dough .
CURLY: He was n't sharing it , either .
EDNA: He 's down the hall , throwing up .
HOMER: What kind of plane are you flying ?
WALLY: A B-24 Liberator .
HOMER: Liberator
WALLY: Have you enlisted ?
HOMER: They would n't take me . I 'm Class IV I 've got a heart defect .
WALLY: Really ! Is it serious ?
HOMER: No , it 's not serious . I 'm just not supposed to get excited . You know no strain , no stress . I try to keep calm all the time .
WALLY: Oh , well . I do n't imagine there 's any strain or stress around *here* ! Homer appreciates the joke .
LARCH: Just fine .
CANDY: Boy or girl ?
ANGELA: It was nothingit 's all over .
WALLY: It 's all over , honey .
CANDY: I would like to have a baby , one day . I really would .
ANGELA: Why , of courseyou can have as many children as you want . I 'm sure you 'll have very beautiful children . Larch wheels Candy behind a curtain .
LARCH: You 'll have Princes of Maine ! You 'll have Kings of New England !
HOMER: Uh it 's the end of October .
FUZZY: Is that soon ?
STEERFORTH: That 's a few months away , Fuzz . I still do n't feel so good .
FUZZY: Oh . It 's the best time ! How come we only get pumpkins once a year ? Fuzzy coughs and coughs .
HOMER: Do n't get too excited , Fuzzy .
FUZZY: Why ca n't we have pumpkins fo Christmas , too ? We do n't get any good presents at Christmas , anyway .
HOMER: Has anyone offered you anything to eat ?
WALLY: Actually , someone did . I just did n't think I could eat anything .
HOMER: I wonder if you might give me a ride .
WALLY: Sure ! Be glad to ! Uh a ride where ?
HOMER: Where are you going ?
WALLY: We 're heading back to Cape Kenneth .
HOMER: Cape Kenneth Wally nods .
LARCH: Doubtless you 'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do .
HOMER: I was n't intending to leave here in order to be entirely uselessI expect I 'll find some ways to be of use .
LARCH: In other parts of the world , I suppose there are other ways .
HOMER: Of course .
LARCH: Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you 're going to find a more gratifying life ? What you 're going to find is people like the poor people who get left hereonly nobody takes care of them as well ! And you wo n't e able to take care of them , either . There 's no taking care of *anybody* not out there !
HOMER: You know I 'm grateful for everything you 've done for me
LARCH: I do n't need your gratitude . Larch hands Homer the heart X ray .
HOMER: I do n't need thisI know all about my condition .
LARCH: It 's your heartyou ought to take it with you . Camera closes on Homer with the X ray .
EDNA: Going where ? Does he have a plan of some kind ?
ANGELA: Will he be back soon ?
LARCH: I do n't know ! He 's just leaving you 're the one who says he needs to see the world ! *That's* what he 'll dohe 'll see the world !
EDNA: He 's leaving
ANGELA: He 'll need clothes some money
LARCH: Let him try to *make* some money ! That 's part of `` seeing the world , '' is n't it ?
ANGELA: Oh , just stop it ! You knew this was going to happen . He 's a young man .
LARCH: He 's still a boyout in the world , he 's still a boy .
ANGELA: Just find him some clothes , Wilbur . He could use some clothes . Camera closes on Larch , fighting tears .
LARCH: I think these will fit you .
EDNA: You 'll need some moneyjust a little something , until you find a job .
CANDY: I 'm okayI can walk .
WALLY: I do n't want you to walkI want to carry you . Should I put the top up ? It might get cold .
CANDY: Nokeep it down . I want to feel the air .
HOMER: I have to go , Curly . I 'm sorry . I could n't find Buster . Will you tell him
ANGELA: Let us be happy for Homer Wells
WALLY: Actually , the Army has given me leave twice . First when my father died , and now I 'm on leave to help my mother I 'm just trying to get her ready fo the harvest . She 's no farmer . Apples were my dad 's business . And with the war on , she 's short on pickers .
CANDY: Wally thinks apples are boring .
WALLY: I never said they were boring .
CANDY: You said , `` Apples are n't exactly flying . ''
WALLY: Well , they are n't . Homer looks back at Candy . Her eyes close .
HOMER: I think I 'd probably like the apple usiness .
WALLY: You 're a little overqualified , are n't you ?
HOMER: No , I 'm not . I need a job .
WALLY: The only jobs are picking jobs . Picking apples is truly boring .
CANDY: There ! You said it was boring .
WALLY: Well , *picking* them is ! It 's about as exciting as walking !
HOMER: Is your family in the apple business , too ?
CANDY: No , but I work thereI like it . My dad 's a lobsterman .
HOMER: I 've never seen a lobster .
CANDY: Really ?
HOMER: I 've never seen the ocean , either .
WALLY: You 've never seen the *ocean* ? Homer shakes his head , smiles .
CANDY: I could n't have a baby with someone who 's leaving meI did n't know what else to do !
HOMER: I know .
CANDY: He 's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay ! They 're going to be shooting at him !
HOMER: Where 's Mandalay ?
CANDY: Burma !
HOMER: Oh
CANDY: I ca n't have a baby alone . I do n't even know if he 's coming back !
HOMER: I understand .
WALLY: Honey , honey of course I 'll come ack . Candy pounds on his chest with her fists .
CANDY: You do n't *know* , Wally . You have no *idea* ! Wally backs away . Candy sobs uncontrollably .
HOMER: This is all normal . Do n't worry . The abortion procedure it affects you . It 's the ether , too . It 'll take a little time .
WALLY: I do n't *have* any time . There 's a *war* !
HOMER: It 's all very normal .
WALLY: You ought to cut that shit outit 's terrible for you .
CANDY: I 'm a little worried about the about how much bleeding is okay .
HOMER: It should taper off tomorrow , but it can come back again . You have cramps ? They 'll ease up , almost entirely . As long as the bleeding is n't heavy , it 's normal .
WALLY: Give it here !
HOMER: `` Burma run '' because you fly ove Burma
WALLY: *And* over the Himalayas . That 's called flying over the hump .
HOMER: What lousy luckI mean your orders to draw an assignment like that !
WALLY: Actually , I volunteered .
HOMER: It 's the flying , right ? You love to fly , do n't you ?
WALLY: I love the bombing , too . But there 's also the Himalayasthey have the most wicked air currents in the world . I would n't miss flying there fo anything .
HOMER: Oh , I would love that , Wally .
CANDY: I guess I 'll see you around the orchards . Thanks for everything .
HOMER: Sure I 'll see you around .
CANDY: I love you , Wally .
WALLY: I love you , too . See you tomorrow .
OLIVE: How do you do , Homer Wells Homer has never met anyone like her .
HOMER: How do you do

MR. ROSE: That daughter of mine sure is Miss Hospitality , ai n't she , Wally ?
WALLY: Homer 's got no experience , Arthur , ut he 's smarter then I am . He 's a fast learner .
MR. ROSE: This is history . Ai n't that what you 're sayin ' , Wally ? I guess we makin ' *history* havin ' this young man stay with us !
WALLY: See you later .
HOMER: So . What should I do now ?
MR. ROSE: Out back , there 's a shed . It 's just a mess . If that shed was bette organized , I could put my truck in there .
PEACHES: What kind of a name is Homer ?
HOMER: It 's the name of a cat . Originally . Well , not *originally* . Homer decides to stop . Another silence .
MR. ROSE: Now , nowwe all got names , sensible or not . Peaches is from Georgia , where we met him pickin ' peaches . He 's still etter with peaches than hs is with apples . Jack here is new . And this here is Hero , 'cause he was a hero of some kind or other once . Ai n't that right , Hero ?
ROSE ROSE: What 's that ?
HOMER: It 's just my heart .
ROSE ROSE: What you got a picture of your heart for ? He holds up the X ray , in order to show her .
HOMER: There 's a little something wrong with it . Just this part herethe ight ventricle . It 's slightly enlarged .
ROSE ROSE: So what ?
HOMER: Yes , so what . It 's nothing serious , eally . Just a small defect .
MR. ROSE: It 's big enough to keep you out of the war , I suppose . Ai n't that right ?
HOMER: Right .
MR. ROSE: They told me I was too old to serve .
PEACHES: They told Muddy his feet was too flat ! Everybody laughs , except Muddy .
MUDDY: And you was `` generally unfit , '' as I ecall .
HOMER: Do you like to read ?
ROSE ROSE: I ca n't read . Nobody taught me .
HOMER: `` I looked at the stars , and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them as he froze to death , and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude . '' Homer looks up ; there 's no response .
JACK: Since you 're the one who 's smart enough to read what 's this ?
HOMER: It 's a list of rules , it seems .
ROSE ROSE: *Whose* rules ?
MUDDY: They 're for us , I suppose .
JACK: Go on and read 'em , Homer .
HOMER: `` One . Please do n't smoke in bed . ''
ROSE ROSE: It 's too late for that one !
MR. ROSE: Stop it , Homer . They are n't our rules . We did n't write them . I do n't see no eason to read them .
HOMER: Okay
WALLY: Remember this ! In the morning , when the tall grass is wet , you can make the Jeep slide on the grass . Can you feel it ?
HOMER: What about the trees ?
WALLY: The trees are flakantiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground .
CANDY: I know what you 've been doing .
WALLY: He *loved* it ! Did n't you ?
HOMER: Yeah , it was great .
CANDY: He thinks people *like* to get whacked y branches .
WALLY: *Homer* liked it ! Did n't you ?
HOMER: Yeah , sure . There 's no stress o strain around here
VERNON: What 's wrong with you ? Mr. Rose takes Homer aside .
MR. ROSE: That 's Vernon . You best stay away from him until he gets to know you etterthen you best stay away from him *more* !
WALLY: You getting along okay ? Before Homer can answer , the women interrupt .
BIG DOT: Where is that Candy ?
FLORENCE: Did she leave you , Wally ?
DEBRA: Who 's the boy ?
FLORENCE: Wally , you can marry Debra if Candy leaves you !
BIG DOT: Wally 's gon na marry *me* if Candy leaves him !
DEBRA: You can marry all three of us , Wally !
FLORENCE: We can take turns . Wally puts his hand to his heart .
WALLY: You girls make it hard for a guy to go off to war . But I 'll leave my best man here to pinch-hit for me .
HOMER: Uh actually , picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while . I 'm grateful for the job .
WALLY: You 're the one who 's helping *me* , Homer . You 're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I 'm gone . Candy , too .
HOMER: Well , sure that 's good , then . All I mean is , I 'm lucky I met you .
WALLY: I do n't think so , Homer . *I'm* the lucky one .
MR. ROSE: You pickin ' more cider apples then anythin ' else . Them drops is good only for cider . And you pickin ' the stems with the apples only half the time . They good only for cider , too if you do n't pick them stems . The rule is , you wan na pick the apple *with* the stem , Homer . And see here see that *bud* that 's just above the stem ? That 's the bud fo *next year's* applethat 's called the *spur* . You pick the spur , you pickin ' two years in oneyou pickin ' next year 's apple 'fore it have a chance to grow . You leave that on the branch , you hear ?
HOMER: I guess so
ANGELA: Wilbur , you should read this . Larch stares at Angela , who holds a letter .
EDNA: Dr. Holtz seems nice . I think he only wants to help
LARCH: He is a goddamn psychiatristof *course* he wants to `` help '' ! He 'd be happy if he could help *commit* me !
ANGELA: It 's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to e careful of , Wilbur .
LARCH: One has to be more than `` careful '' of Mrs. Goodhallshe has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country ! I 'd like to give her a little ether .
EDNA: So what are you going to do ?
LARCH: `` Homer Wells , born Portland , Maine , March 2 , 1915 ''
EDNA: Homer was born *here* , in , what was it , 1922 ?
LARCH: `` graduated Bowdoin College , 1935 , and Harvard School of Medicine , 1939 . ''
ANGELA: This is *your* life story , Wilbur ! You just changed the dates !
LARCH: `` An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in , South End Branch . For his age , he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon ; he is also experienced in pediatric care ''
ANGELA: You *invented* him ! You 've completely made his up !
LARCH: Do n't you understand ? The board is going to *replace* me ! That 's what the `` new blood '' is *for* !
EDNA: You mean they 'll replace you with someone who wo n't perform abortions .
LARCH: Well , we can only guess about that , Edna . They *are* against the law .
ANGELA: These *credentials* are against the law !
LARCH: We all know who trained Homerhis credentials are as good as mine are . Do n't you be holy to me about the *law* ! What has the law done for any of us here ? Edna and Angela think this over .
EDNA: But what about school records ? Home does n't have any *diplomas*
LARCH: He *will* have them , Edna . The women are shocked , awed .
ANGELA: Oh , Wilbur , I do n't know We do n't even know where he is !
MR. ROSE: Here he is . No one moves .
MUDDY: What view ? Peaches slides over and Homer sits down .
HOMER: Are we supposed to be up here ? The ules said
MR. ROSE: Homer , you the only one who 's read them rules , so you the only one who feels like he 's doin ' somethin ' wrong . The others laugh .
MUDDY: *What* view ?
MR. ROSE: Well , Muddy , we can look at all these angry stars Homer 's been readin ' to us about .
JACK: I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons ' .
MR. ROSE: You think so , Jack ? Well I would n't want to be in that Wally 's shoes tonight .
ROSE ROSE: Daddy , I 'd like to be in that Wally 's shoes *every* night .
MR. ROSE: You lucky you in your work boots tonight , girl
ROSE ROSE: What 's lucky about that ?
MR. ROSE: You know where that Wally is tonight , darlin ' ? He 's up there in them angry stars . He 's flyin ' all around up there with them Japs shooting at him .
OLIVE: Thank you , Arthur . And how is our Homer working out ?
MR. ROSE: Oh , he 's a smart young man , most of the timeWally was right about him .
OLIVE: No rotten apples ?
MR. ROSE: No , nonot this year . Well maybe we got *one* , but it ai n't Homer .
OLIVE: Rose dear girl , I 'm sure I can find you some other clothes . You must have some things that would fit her .
CANDY: I have a *ton* of things that would fit you .
MR. ROSE: Now , now , Candythis girl do n't need no more clothes , not for pickin ' . He starts leading his daughter away .
OLIVE: Arthur , there 's no such thing as a young woman who 's got all the clothes she needs .
CANDY: So . Not bored yet ?
HOMER: I 'm *never* bored ! It 's all very different for me here . Homer has the hardest time looking at Candy .
CANDY: When I 'm not thinking about Wally . I 'm not good at being alone . Oh , goodness . You meant yes , I 'm fine . I I do n't suppose you 've seen a lobster yet .
HOMER: Okay
CANDY: I do n't think Mr. Rose would leave without you .
PEACHES: Whoalook at that Homer ! He 's gettin ' all dressed up for supper tonight !
ROSE ROSE: He ai n't gettin ' dressed to have supper with *us* , Peaches !
MR. ROSE: Do n't let us make you nervous o nothin'we know you got ta job to do .
MUDDY: Yeah , we can wait all night for the water to come back onyou just go on and take your time .
RAY: Hungry ? Homer looks uncertain .
HOMER: They eat everything ?
RAY: Everything that falls to the bottom .
CANDY: It 's time somebody ate *them* .
RAY: I was lookin ' for Wally 's letter . I was gon na show it to Homer They made him a captain already *Captain* Worthington !
CANDY: Daddy , it 's a letter to *me* .
RAY: He mentions Homer , too , you know .
CANDY: Wally said to say , `` Hello . ''
HOMER: Oh ! That 's nice .
RAY: Wally said the most spectacular hits were in the oil fields at Yenangyat .
HOMER: A movie *outside* ?
CANDY: Yes . But it 's closed all the time now , because of the blackout .
HOMER: People watched the movies in thei cars ?
CANDY: When they watched at all . Do you like movies ?
HOMER: Yes ! I 've only seen one , though . Candy looks at him ; he is n't joking .
CANDY: You 've seen only one movie ? Which one ?
HOMER: `` King Kong '' . It 's really good . Candy laughs .
CANDY: I have n't seen `` King Kong '' since I was a kid !
ANGELA: That 's a pie apple , Wilbur . Home said you 're not supposed to eat it ! Angela hands him another apple .
LARCH: So he 's an apple expert , is he ?
ANGELA: Wilbur , he picked them for us himself
LARCH: You do n't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples ? Both Edna and Angela glower at him .
EDNA: He probably does n't make much money picking appleshe must have had to pay to send them , too .
LARCH: I would n't worry , Edna , that he does n't have money . If he gets hungry , he can pick his dinner !
EDNA: Wilbur , it 's a *gift* ! How can you e angry with Homer for sending us a *gift* ?
LARCH: I 'll show him a *gift* ! I 'll give him a gift he can *use* ! Larch storms out of the room .
CANDY: But you looked as if you liked it .
HOMER: I *did* like it . All I said was , `` It 's not 'King Kong ' . '' Candy makes a face , but in good fun .
CANDY: She *did* love him ! How many women have you known ? Homer is embarrassed ; he ducks the question .
HOMER: And what did she die of , exactly ?
CANDY: She was torn apart ! She died of a oken heart .
HOMER: Oh , sure !
CANDY: Well , she was in a weakened condition I do n't know ! What about `` King Kong '' ? ! Is that medically possible ?
HOMER: At least King Kong knew what he *wanted* .
ROSE ROSE: What is you *doin'* with that Candy , Homer ?
MUDDY: He 's makin ' history , I suppose .
ROSE ROSE: You ai n't gettin ' in no trouble , I hope .
HOMER: No trouble .
PEACHES: That Candyshe 's the nicest girl I know !
MUDDY: She 's about the most beautiful girl I ever seenI do n't know if she 's the nicest .
HOMER: She 's the nicest *and* the most eautiful girl I 've ever known .
ROSE ROSE: That sounds like you is in trouble already , Homer .
MR. ROSE: That 's rightthat sounds like trouble to me .
HOMER: I 'm not in trouble .
ROSE ROSE: Yeah , you is . I know when people is in trouble , and you is .
LARCH: and his *pathetic* resume is the est I 've seen . Though I find it hard to believe the Board would be interested in this character .
DR. HOLTZ: But he looks like an excellent young man , a first-rate candidate !
LARCH: He looks like a bleeding-heart missionary *moron* to me , but that 's going to be the problem with any doctor interested in coming here !
MRS. GOODHALL: Do you know him ?
LARCH: *No* ! I do n't want to know him ! He 's doing *missionary* workin *India* ! I wrote him *weeks* ago , but he 's either too holy or too busy to answer . Maybe he got killed in the war !
MRS. GOODHALL: I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to e dismissedthat part of the world equires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here .
LARCH: Does it *snow* in Bombay ? One winte here and we 'll be shipping him south , in a *coffin* !
MRS. GOODHALL: You ca n't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow* have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is ?
LARCH: Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him !
DR. HOLTZ: But , Dr. Larch , he seems exceptionally qualified
LARCH: I 'm not talking about his medical qualifications . It 's the *Christian* thing that bothers meI just do n't see it being of much *use* around here .
MRS. GOODHALL: I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here !
LARCH: Anyway , I was just showing you this guy as an example of what 's available I did n't think you 'd be interested .
DR. HOLTZ: We 're *very* interested !
MRS. GOODHALL: Yes , *very* !
DR. HOLTZ: You would n't be opposed to meeting with him ?
LARCH: I suppose it would n't hurt to *meet* him . What 's his name again ?
ANGELA: Dr. Homer Wells .
LARCH: I just hope he wo n't expect us to say *Grace* all the time . The three elderly gentlemen repeat the name .
MRS. GOODHALL: It 's a nice name , very New England .
DR. HOLTZ: Very *Maine* , a very *local*-sounding name .
EDNA: *Very* !
LARCH: Edna ! Come dance with me ! Let 's be foolish tonight .
EDNA: Does he *know* he 's supposed to be in India ? Does he even *want* to come back ?
LARCH: He 's a field hand ! What could possibly hold him there ?
MR. ROSE: Cider do n't have no taste till late in Octoberit 's too watery now , when we 're usin ' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins . You do n't get no *good* cider till you 're pickin ' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas , them Baldwins and them Russerts
HOMER: What about the worms ? Most of these apples are the dropsoff the ground , ight ? There have to be worms .
MR. ROSE: Of *course* there 's worms , Homer ! And what is them worms , really ? They just *protein* , them worms ! They is *good* for you !
JACK: Them people drinkin ' that cider , they do n't know there 's a cigarette in there !
MR. ROSE: It 's not that hard to find it in there , Jackit 'll take you just a minute . You just got ta go fishin ' .
JACK: You mean *swimmin'* . I ai n't goin ' in that vat to fish out no cigarette !
MR. ROSE: What business is you in , Jack ? Just tell me what your business is
MUDDY: Just say you 're in the *apple* usiness , man . That 's the only usiness you wan na be in . Just say it . Jack pulls a knife on Mr. Rose .
PEACHES: You do n't wan na go in the knife usiness with Mistuh Rosejust say you 're in the *apple* business , Jack !
JACK: What business are *you* in ?
MR. ROSE: I 'm in the *knife* business , Jack . You do n't wan na go in the knife usiness with me .
MUDDY: You 're lucky he did n't cut you *nipples* off , man .
PEACHES: The good news , Jack , is you 're half- undressed for *swimmin'*
MUDDY: Yeah , that cigarette ai n't hard to find when you 're properly undressed . Jack starts to undress for the vat . Mr. Rose ushers Homer and Rose Rose outside .
HOMER: Give men that . I know how to do it .
ROSE ROSE: Oh , I suppose you is a doctor , Homer ?
HOMER: Almost .
MR. ROSE: I do n't need no `` almost '' a doctor , Homer .
ROSE ROSE: We should drown that damn Jack in the vat !
MR. ROSE: Now , now , darlin ' Jack just needs to know what business he 's in .
ROSE ROSE: Yeah , you really showed him , Daddy you just about cut your own hand off , and all you cut off *him* was his clothes !
MR. ROSE: You oughta know you do n't go to jail for cuttin ' a guy 's *clothes* . Ai n't that right , Homer ? Homer winces at the stitching .
CANDY: You 're a natural . You were born to drive a car like this .
HOMER: You think ? Maybe I was . I love this place ! Homer looks up at the giant movie screen .
CANDY: Yes and no . When you come here , you do n't really care about the movie . Homer stares at Candy in disbelief .
HOMER: You do n't care about the movie ? Candy looks at him for a moment .
CANDY: What are you so crazy about the movies for ?
HOMER: It was my favorite night at the orphanagemovie night . We 'd race into the dining hall . Of course everyone wanted to sit in front , so we 'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing .
CANDY: At least you were never lonely .
HOMER: I did n't say that . Growing up in an orphanage , you 're always lonely . You 're just never alone .
CANDY: You do n't miss it ?
HOMER: I miss things . I miss people . I miss reading to the boys .
CANDY: But you had so much *responsibility* .
HOMER: I never *asked* for any esponsibility .
CANDY: Just a little privacy . Homer laughs .
HOMER: Did you come here with Wallyto *not* watch movies ?
CANDY: Sometimes movies mostly bore Wally .
HOMER: Ah-ha . So what is thata radio ?
CANDY: The *speaker* . For the movie sound . Candy looks at Homer .
HOMER: How could you not *care* about the movie ?
CANDY: You just cuddle . You come to hug to kiss . You do n't *come* here to watch the movie .
HOMER: That 's what *I'd* come here for . I 'd watch the movie .
CANDY: Not with the right girl you would n't .
LARCH: Fuzzy ? Fuzzy ?
BUSTER: What are you going to tell the little ones ?
LARCH: I 'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted .
BUSTER: Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him ?
LARCH: They 'll believe it because they want to believe it .
BUSTER: Should n't we tell Homer ?
LARCH: If Homer wanted to know what was happening here , he could pick up a telephone and call us .
BUSTER: It was a family with a bette eathing machine then the one Dr. Larch built .
OLIVE: Some mail for you , Homer .
PEACHES: Ai n't you gon na see what it is , Homer ?
MR. ROSE: Mind your own business , Peaches .
PEACHES: Sorry , Homer
HOMER: Are n't you worried that people will cut their feet ?
CANDY: Nobody will swim here until next summer . By then , the water will have ubbed the glass smooth against the sandthere wo n't be any sharp edges .
HOMER: Right .
MR. ROSE: Slow down , Homerdo n't be in such a ig hurry .
HOMER: This is easyI 'm not hurrying .
MR. ROSE: You still doin ' it too fast !
ROSE ROSE: He 's in a big hurry , all right . I told you he 's in trouble .
HOMER: Just tell me . Do you want me to go ? Do you want me to stay ?
CANDY: It will be okay .
HOMER: *What* will be okay ?
CANDY: We have to wait and see . I think that , for *everything* in life , you have to wait and see . Homer throws a snail with more force .
HOMER: I 'll just move on , get another jo somewhere .
RAY: Every time you throw a snail off the dock , you 're makin ' someone start his whole life over .
CANDY: Maybe we 're doing the snails a favor , Daddy . Ray looks at the two of them ; he sighs .
RAY: It 's gettin ' late . I think I 'll pack it in .
CANDY: Good night , Daddy .
OLIVE: I used to hate it when Wally went ack to collegeeven when it was just college ! And this was when his father was still alive I hated it even then . Naturally I hate this more .
HOMER: Mrs. Worthington , I feel I 'm very lucky to be here .
OLIVE: There 's not a lot of work in the winter , and you 'll have to tolerate Vernoneven Wally despises him , and Wally likes everyone .
HOMER: I think Wally will be fine , Mrs. Worthingtonhe seems indestructible to me .
OLIVE: I do n't know . Just promise me one thing .
HOMER: Uh sure .
OLIVE: Just promise me that , if there 's a lizzard , you 'll move into Wally 's oom until it 's over .
MR. ROSE: You take care now , Mrs. Worthin'ton . They shake hands .
OLIVE: Good-bye , Arthur . Homer , I 'll see you tomorrow ?
HOMER: Right .
MUDDY: We all set , I think .
MR. ROSE: You all take care of yourself , too , Homer !
PEACHES: We see you next harvest .
MUDDY: Do n't freeze to death , Homer .
JACK: Go on and freeze to death if you want to , Homer .
MR. ROSE: Now , now , Jackthat just ai n't right .
ROSE ROSE: You just stay out of trouble , Homer !
CANDY: Olive told me . You might have told me yourself .
HOMER: I 'm just waiting and seeing . Like you said . She smiles . He goes to her ; they embrace .
LARCH: I think we may have lot him to the world . He 's not coming back .
HERO: Who 's that ?
PEACHES: It 's that Homer !
MUDDY: It 's that Candy , too
MR. ROSE: Do n't this place look like home ?
PEACHES: It look nicer then home !
MR. ROSE: What have you two been doin ' to make it look so nice ?
ROSE ROSE: How is that Wally doing ?
CANDY: Oh , he 's fine ! I just heard from him . He 's bombing all these places Homer tries to help out .
HOMER: bridges , oil refineries , fuel depots
MUDDY: He just was n't up for the trip . More silence .
MR. ROSE: That Jack just never knew what his usiness was .
PEACHES: They ai n't dropsI picked 'em off the tree !
MR. ROSE: Then you pickin ' 'em too fastthey ai n't no better than drops to me . See that bruise , and that one ? *Half* of these is bruised ! Look at this one ! It ai n't got no stem ! You might as well *step* on 'em , toothey only good for cider .
CANDY: Do you think I 'm having a good time ? Do you think I 'm just *teasing* you ? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally ?
HOMER: So we should `` wait and see . '' For how long ?
CANDY: I grew up with Wally . I began my adult life with him .
HOMER: Fine . That 's all there is to it then .
CANDY: No ! That 's not all there is to it ! I love you , tooI *know* I do .
HOMER: Okay , okayI know you do , too .
CANDY: It 's a good thing I did n't have that aby , is n't it ?
PEACHES: Ai n't you eatin ' with us , Rose ? She used to eat with us . Now we ai n't good enough for her , I guess .
HERO: She ai n't hungry , maybe .
MUDDY: She ai n't hungry every mornin ' 'cause she 's sick every mornin ' . Homer gets up to take his dishes inside .
HOMER: You okay , Rose ?
ROSE ROSE: I guess you must like watchin ' me be sick
HOMER: I do n't like watching anyone be sick .
ROSE ROSE: Not yet . What do you know about it ?
HOMER: I know more than I want to know about it . Who 's the father ?
ROSE ROSE: Do n't trouble yourself about it , Homerthis ai n't your business .
HOMER: But you do n't look very happy .
ROSE ROSE: *Happy* ! What are you thinkin ' ? How am I supposed to take care of a baby ! I ca n't have a baby .
HOMER: Rose , please listen . Whatever you want to do , I can help you . She is taken back .
ROSE ROSE: You think Daddy 's gon na let me go anywhere ? I ai n't going *nowhere* .
HOMER: Rose , listendo n't *do* anything . You know , I mean to yourself . Please listen
CANDY: We should take her to St . Cloud 's . That much is obvious , is n't it ? Let her make up her mind when she gets there
HOMER: I told her ! She does n't feel she can do that . Something about her fathe not letting her go anywhere
CANDY: Well , we have to help her ! Homer does n't respond .
ROSE ROSE: Hi She keeps setting the table .
CANDY: I 've got some more clothes for you I just keep forgetting to bring them with me .
ROSE ROSE: I do n't need no more clothes , thank you .
CANDY: Rose , I know what 's going on . Home told me . I got pregnant , tooabout a year ago . I 've been through this . Rose Rose looks down .
ROSE ROSE: You ai n't been through what I been through , Candy .
CANDY: Yes , I *have* ! Rose Rose dismissively waves her hand .
ROSE ROSE: I ca n't go nowhere .
CANDY: Why ? Rose Rose stays silent .
ROSE ROSE: No . It ai n't Muddy . Muddy 's just
MR. ROSE: I 'll be up top
CANDY: She wo n't go to St . Cloud 's !
HOMER: Well , we ca n't force her . It 's he decision .
CANDY: You do n't understand ! It 's he father
HOMER: Mr. Rose *knows* ?
CANDY: He 's the *father* ! He 's her baby 's father !
HOMER: Wait *wait* ! Are you sure ?
CANDY: We 've got to keep her away from that astard !
MR. ROSE: I did n't see where you was pickin ' this mornin ' , Homer , but you musta worked up a big appetite . You look like you 're serious about gettin ' to your lunch today !
HOMER: Is it true ?
MR. ROSE: I think you been stayin ' up too late at night , Homer .
HOMER: You 're actually having sex with you own little girl ? Is that possible ?
MR. ROSE: Ai n't nobody havin ' *sex* with my little girl , Homerthat 's somethin ' a father knows .
HOMER: You 're lying . How can you with your own daughter !
MR. ROSE: Homer , do n't you know what business you in ? You do n't wan na go into no usiness with me , Homerai n't that ight ?
HOMER: Go on , cut my clothes . I 've got othe clothes . Mr. Rose is indignant .
MR. ROSE: You a fine one to be talkin ' about lies . Shame ! These people took you in . That boy Wally 's at *war* !
HOMER: But she 's your *daughter*
MR. ROSE: And I *love* her ! There ai n't nobody else gon na treat her as good as I do ! I would n't do nothin ' to hurt her , Homeryou must know that .
HOMER: She 's *pregnant* . Do you know *that* ?
MUDDY: Do n't mess in this , Homer , if you know what 's good for you .
HOMER: How long 's this been going on , Muddy ?
MUDDY: Long enough . You ai n't gon na stop it .
CANDY: No ! No !
MAJOR WINSLOW: When the plane was hit , the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together . The copilot jumped third . All on Captain Worthington 's orders the captain was still flying the plane . None of the men of the ground could see the skythat 's how thick the jungle was . They never saw the plane crashthey never *heard* it crash . They never saw Captain Worthington 's parachute , either .
OLIVE: Why was he missing for twenty days ?
MAJOR WINSLOW: Because the crew thought he 'd gone down with the plane . They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India . It was n't until that they sorted through their gear
CANDY: Who cares about their *gear* ?
MAJOR WINSLOW: Three men jumped from the plane , but they had four compasses with them . One of the crew jumped with Captain Worthington 's compass .
CANDY: He was in Burma for twenty days without a compass ?

HOMER: At least there 's no more waiting and seeing . At least I got to see the ocean .
MUDDY: Rose Rose has runned away !

HOMER: Sure . Thanks .
CANDY: I know you do n't think much of being needed , or of me for that matter
HOMER: I 'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you . It was unnecessary .
CANDY: No , I 'm the one who should be sorry . You have every right to be angry .
HOMER: No . You warned me . I did n't listen , ut you warned me . Candy looks surprised .
BUSTER: Dr. Larch ? Dr. Larch ?
MUDDY: You ever see a palm tree , Homer ?
PEACHES: He ai n't never been outta Maine !
HERO: Ai n't you sick of pine trees , Homer ? Homer just smiles and shakes his head .
HOMER: Thanks , guys I 'd like to go with you . But I 've got to move on .
MUDDY: Yeah , well you could move on with *us* , man ! You could move on somewhere *warm* !

EDNA: Homer , do you know what this is ?
HOMER: Sure . It 's my heart .
ANGELA: Actually , it 's Fuzzy 's . There 's nothing wrong with your heart .
HOMER: Fuzzy 's ? !
EDNA: Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of the war , Homerthat 's why he did it . That 's why he told you it was yours .
ANGELA: I think he worried about his own heart . He said it would never stand up to Homer Wells going off to war .
HOMER: `` Thus I began my new life , in a new name , and with everything new about me I felt like one in a dream The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much want of hope Whether it lasted for a year , or more , or less , I do not know . I only know that it was , and ceased to e ; and there I leave it . '' Homer stops and looks at the boys ' faces .
CURLY: What happens next ? Homer smiles .
HOMER: That 's tomorrow , Curly . Let 's mot give the story away .
DEALER: Somebody shut the goddam window . Let a man think .
FIRST PLAYER: On the last hand even , you could n't give me a break .

DANNY: You ca n't have better than a pair of kings !

KID: I do n't figure to take him right away . But if I can hang in there long enough , I can outlast him . If I can outlast him , I got a chance . You admit that , do n't you , that I got a chance ?
SHOOTER: I already said I did n't think you were ready .
KID: Did you think you were ready when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee ?
SHOOTER: Kid , I thought I was the best stud poker player in the world . I 'm telling you now , I thought I was the best .
KID: Well , I do n't think I 'm just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards . I got something .
SHOOTER: No , you ai n't no cocky square . And you probably got something .
KID: Okay . And I ai n't saying that you was either when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee .
SHOOTER: If you got the stuff , being a little cocky do n't hurt you none .
KID: Well , would you say if I got any chance at all ?
SHOOTER: This much of a chance . If Lancey is not right . If he 's got a cold , o his stomach ulcer is acting up , o something like that .
KID: But then everybody 'd see he was n't ight and it would n't prove nothing . Listen , we got to have it understood . If he 's not right , we call it off till he is .
SHOOTER: You 're set on a real showdown , are n't you ? Your mind 's all made up . They start back off the pier .
KID: I got to . You said yourself I got to . I 'm overdue .

KID: I wish you would , Shooter Man .
SHOOTER: All right .
KID: Hey , what if he turns me down ?
SHOOTER: He wo n't , the way I 'll spread the word . He 'll have to take you on , someone in your class . If he ducked it , that 'd make you The Man .
KID: You think he knows I 'm around ?
SHOOTER: He can smell meat like you a mile and a half up the river . He knows you 're around and he 'll sit down with you . You want to butt heads with The Man , I 'll set it up .
KID: I would n't want to wait around too long . I want to get in and get it over with .
SHOOTER: He must of come to St. Louis for a ig money game . I 'll probably get asked do I want to deal it for them . And however long that takes , he 'll have to rest up for you .
KID: Oh , well , if he 's tooling a dollar , I can understand that . Sure .
SHOOTER: You got much of a stake ?
KID: Close to three grand .
SHOOTER: Work on it . But three grand will give you a ride and even if you do n't win , why you 'll come away with a good idea of what you 're made of . But once you go in Kid you ca n't quit . You get that straight right now . Two of you go in and only one of you can come out . Christian sees them and moves toward them .
KID: Well , school 's out . I damn sure do n't want no lessons . I want everything he 's got .
SHOOTER: It 's the only way to be , Kid .
CHRISTIAN: When we leaving town , Kid ? This week ?
KID: No , I wo n't be ready . Not for a while .
CHRISTIAN: I thought
KID: Might even turn out we do n't go .
CHRISTIAN: You must feel different about it than you did Saturday .
KID: Yeah , I 'm feeling a little different .
KID: It 's all right . You do n't have to act like a cat . You 're not bothering me .
CHRISTIAN: You want me to turn out the light ?
KID: No . I 'm overtired , that 's why I ca n't sleep . Why ca n't you sleep ?
CHRISTIAN: Undertired , I guess . If a person ests all day , she does n't have much to rest up from at night . Why do n't you have a nice hot bath ? I could give you a rubdown and then you could have a nice hot bath , and then maybe you could sleep .
KID: 'Kay . Ca n't hurt to try it .
CHRISTIAN: Last night I went to a movie with The Shooter 's woman . French movie .
KID: In French ?
CHRISTIAN: They had the words in English at the ottom of the picture . But The Shooter 's woman knew what they were saying without it . Pig 's woman o somebody told me she went to college .
KID: Sure . Majored in man-eating .
CHRISTIAN: I think maybe she really did go . But I never quite dared to up and ask her .
KID: I did n't know you ran with The Shooter 's woman .
CHRISTIAN: We got to be kind of friendly when you both were in that three-day game down to Cairo . 'Course she 's older ' n me .
KID: And been around more . A lot more . What was the movie like ?
CHRISTIAN: Weird . It was n't a straight story where you knew whose side you were on , the way you do in regula pictures .
KID: American pictures .
CHRISTIAN: Yeah . There were lots of things I did n't understand .
KID: What was it about ?
CHRISTIAN: Well , there 's this town in Europe a long time ago where they get a message from a Spanish general he 's coming to spend the night with his troops . So all the men are scared silly about what the soldiers will do to them .
KID: Nothing weird about that .
CHRISTIAN: But all the wives and daughters tell the men to go hide somewhere and let them bargain with the enemy .
KID: That do n't make much sense .
CHRISTIAN: Wait . The way they handle it is they go to bed with the Spaniards . And the next morning the soldiers go off peacefully and everybody 's happy .
KID: Including the husbands and fathers ? Do n't they suspect ?
CHRISTIAN: That 's part of what I was n't sure of . I guess they know what went on ut they care more about their safety and their money than they do about their honor .
KID: Then they got their heads screwed on straight . Honor 's just an idea . You ca n't see or feel it and you ca n't eat it and you sure as hell ca n't get any mileage on it . She slaps him on the rump and straightens up .
CHRISTIAN: I 'll just turn off the bath water .
MELBA: Hello Yes , it is . You want him ? Shooter ! Telephone ! Shooter !
SHOOTER: If you 'd rather we put it in my room
MELBA: Are you kidding ?
SHOOTER: Hello ? Well , hello . What brings you to our fair city ? Little action , maybe ?
LANCEY: How could you guess , Shooter ? I was invited by a Mr. William Schlaegel
SHOOTER: Owns most of the Schlaegel Brewery . Braumeister beer .
LANCEY: As he put it , rather bluntly , I felt , we do n't want everyone to have to watch everyone else dealing to see to it they do n't make any little accidental errors by mistake . I told him a man could n't ask for a bette guarantee of a fair-and-square game than having The Shooter deal it . So if you 're willing , we 're meeting at two o'clock in the afternoon . Ask for Mr. Schlaegel 's suite at the Park Sherman Good . I 'm glad you can do it , Shooter . Be a pleasure to see you again Oh pretty much the same Just have to be a little careful about smoking and drinking and eating and eathing . See you tomorrow . Good night .
MELBA: Would n't be much point wearing it in private . Sure , why not , as long as you do n't have a bulge to hide ? They start walking .
CHRISTIAN: I do n't know , Melba .
MELBA: My guess is there is n't anything about you needs hiding . But I 'll give you a more definitive opinion at the bath .
CHRISTIAN: At the what ?
MELBA: Turkish Bath . After we 're through shopping . I 'm treating you , Christian .
CHRISTIAN: I never been . I 'm not even sure what you do .
MELBA: You do n't do anything . That 's what 's so marvelous . They do it to you .
CHRISTIAN: The third time I stayed . Never went ack to the boarding house except to pick up my things .
MELBA: And that side of it 's held up ? No complaints in the bed department ?
CHRISTIAN: Well , just one .
MELBA: Yes ?
CHRISTIAN: The nights he is n't there .
MELBA: He really does that to you , does he ? You got one of the rare ones .
CHRISTIAN: You find a guy , you love him , and that 's it . It 's supposed to just go on like that for life . Right ?
MELBA: According to the propaganda , right .
CHRISTIAN: But it is n't my life , it 's his life , with me tacked on . You have any idea what it 's like to be a hash slinge in a cheap restaurant ?
MELBA: No , honey , the stock crash wafted me ight from the daisy chain into unmarried bliss .
CHRISTIAN: It 's hell , if you 'll excuse the word . But I did n't want to quit . The Kid made me . I felt I ought to hang on to something that was me away from him . You know what I mean ?
MELBA: Sure . Some girls solve the problem y taking on an extra guy .
CHRISTIAN: I 'm serious . Having children might take care of it , I do n't know . Or this is really a terrible thing to admit .
MELBA: Your most sordid secrets are safe with me . Confess .
CHRISTIAN: If he was rich , or famous
MELBA: Why do n't you give him both ?
CHRISTIAN: Why not ? Well , if he was rich and famous , maybe I would n't mind so much just being just a woman to him . Do you think that might make it seem more worthwhile somehow ?
MELBA: Somehow ! Are you sincere , sweetie ? Oooo divine . Is n't this heaven ?
CHRISTIAN: I 'm not sure . In a way it seems soft of She is at a loss for a word .
MELBA: Decadent ? Depraved ? Christian looks blank .
CHRISTIAN: Well , yes .
MELBA: That 's what I meant by heaven .
SHOOTER: Still queens possible flush no help possible flush .

'' First time I heard of this Cincinnati Kid was in New Orleans , at Yeller 's . I knew right away I 'd have to play him someday .
SHOOTER: You 'll enjoy his game .
LANCEY: I may admire it . But if he 's all that good , I doubt if I 'll enjoy it .
SHOOTER: The tougher the competition , the etter you used to like it .
LANCEY: I 've learned to take everything in moderation .
KID: Have a drink with us ?
MELBA: Better not . Shooter said they 'd break at seven , and he has to have his food first , then his nap . You know , there 's a day in your life I 'm looking forward to .
KID: In my life ?
MELBA: The day The Kid becomes The Man .
CHRISTIAN: How 'd you sleep Kid ?

KID: Sure .
CHRISTIAN: Do you think there 's any chance , if you do win this big game , that you might do something else besides cards ? I do n't mean never play poker . I just mean not have it be the only thing you do .
KID: Hell , it 's the only thing I know how to do . What else is there for a guy never finished school ? College graduates are walking the streets looking for jobs trained people , engineers , scientists !
CHRISTIAN: I realize
KID: When you 're The Man , you do n't have to hustle When you 're The Man , The Best , the Big Money comes around on their knees just beggin ' to hustle you . I 'm not goin ' to quit . I 'm goin ' to win .
CHRISTIAN: Yes , I can see that . Of course I did n't say quit .
KID: Well you see how it is .
CHRISTIAN: That 's all right .
KID: Christian , you are n't doing this to e off my back , in case I lose ?
CHRISTIAN: I been thinking about it a long time . I been planning to go home and see how I felt about things .
KID: And this just helped you decide .
CHRISTIAN: That 's all .
KID: Then do n't go .
CHRISTIAN: No , this is your time Now you go on Honey and you play The Man I 'll be at Mama 's .
KID: I wish it could be more .
CHRISTIAN: That 's all right .
KID: I do n't guess I will either .
CHRISTIAN: You going to move ?
KID: If I win , it wo n't be good enough . If I lose , I lose it all .
CHRISTIAN: Goodbye , Kid . Good luck .
KID: Goodbye , Christian . They do n't kiss . He turns and goes out .
BILL: Four stacks ? Right , Schooter ?
SHOOTER: Four .
BILL: Thank you for the entertainment , gentlemen . My particular gratitude to you , Lancey . It 's been a rare pleasure to watch a great artist at work . Thank you for the privilege .
LANCEY: Well now , son , you 're quite welcome . Ca n't say I recall another man , in all my days on the three rivers , who seemed to find it quite so pleasurable losing all that money .
BILL: Good day , gentlemen . You 're welcome to use the premises as long as you like .
SHOOTER: Hi , Kid . Shooter here . Listen , I told the woman I 'd take her to the all park , but I 'm still working . How about you and Christian take he out ?

SHOOTER: Oh . Well listen , would you mind taking her yourself ? The gang 'll be there , in the section Thanks . Appreciate it . See you .
SOKAL: You owe me two fish on the out , plus three on the inning , minus two on no strikeouts so far . The Kid and Melba join them .
HOBAN: Hiya , Kid . Getting yourself in shape for The Man ? Shooter still on the job ?
HOBAN'S WOMAN: Where 's Christian ?
MELBA: Lay off that .
PIG: What 'd she do , take off ? So did mine . Do n't lose no sweat , Kid , there 's plenty more where they came from . All shapes and sizes .
KID: Hi , Hoban . Sokal . Pig . He and Melba sit down .
HOBAN: Boyer . One to two on the sacrifice .
SOKAL: Five to three , I 'll give you . Two- fifty against one-fifty .
HOBAN: Mark it .
SOKAL: I figure they 'll walk him . Fill up first .
KID: Not with who 's coming up . I 'll take the same odds .
MELBA: Get some of this sun .
SOKAL: Mark it .
KID: Guess I will .
HOBAN: Bunting , Sokal .
SOKAL: So they pitched to him . I still win .
PIG: Everybody been on the phone to everybody about coming to watch you and Lancey . Big Spriigi , Yeller to N'Orleans , Old Lady Fingers . They 're all coming .
MELBA: Let me give you some of this . Keep you from burning .
KID: I do n't think
MELBA: Ca n't hurt you .
HOBAN: Chance to invest your profits . Bet you an even fin he make first .
SOKAL: Who we got Warwick ? You got yourself a bet , pal .
SOKAL'S VOICE: Not your day , Hoban . Hey , beer !
MELBA: Mais tu es charmant
KID: Any special reason ?
MELBA: Me . I 'm special . He stands up but does n't move toward her .
KID: Sure you are . You 're The Shooter 's woman .
MELBA: Right . And maybe I 'll go on being The Shooter 's Woman , even after you and I have had our little romp . What do you think about that ?
KID: First place , Old Shooter 'll come arging through that door any minute . He said they were winding it up .
MELBA: No barging . He does n't have his key with him . Have to buzz from downstairs . So we can treat ourselves to a little sample of things to come .
KID: Also it do n't mean anything to you , you 're Christian 's friend ?
MELBA: Honey , she lost her franchise the minute she got on that bus . You know that . I have a shaky sense of security , Kid . Do n't make me feel unwanted .
KID: You know damn well how good it was . Where 's a pack of cards ?
MELBA: What do we need cards for ?
KID: Gin or casino , you name it . All I know is we 're switching to anothe indoor sport .
SHOOTER: Lady Fingers 'll want to come , I bet , and she 's right on the edge of he stake . She could spell me dealing .
LANCEY: Sure , sure . Have n't seen the dea old bitch in fifteen years .
SHOOTER: Well , that 's it , then . Monday night , Room Three-Eleven at the Dorset Hotel . And may the best man win .
LANCEY: Yes , that 's how it usually comes out in the long run . You think this boy is going to give me trouble , Shooter ?
SHOOTER: Yeah , he 's going to give you trouble .
LANCEY: I do n't want it to be one of those marathon games . Not any more .
SHOOTER: Like the session with The Portugee at Jolly 's in Omaha . Remember ?
LANCEY: Sure , sure . Longest game I ever played though , I was a kid on my way to the Klondike gold rush . At Soapy Smith 's in Skagway . Four nights and three days .
SHOOTER: You win ?
LANCEY: Depends how you look at it . When we wound up , the Yukon River had frozen over and you could n't get through to Dawson City till the following June . Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks and missed the gold rush .
SHOOTER: You been around a long time .
LANCEY: That is undeniably true . But it does n't mean I 'm ready to retire . How old is this boy of yours ?
SHOOTER: Twenty-six , twenty-eight , something like that .
LANCEY: Well , now , makes me feel a whole lot etter , knowing that . I was thirty- six when I sliced up Eddie the Dude . This Kid of yours is just going to have to wait a few years .
FELIX: Excuse me , Mr. Shooter , sir , but Mr. Schlaegel asked me to remind you how eager he was to see you .
SHOOTER: I ought to call my woman .
FELIX: Yes , of course . They always like to know it if you 're going to be late for supper .
MELBA: Still building eights .
KID: Thanks for putting it together fo me .
MELBA: It 's not my game . The telephone RINGS . She stands up .
SHOOTER: Explain to The Kid , will you ?
MELBA: He 'll understand .
SHOOTER: Tell him they decided to play a little longer , and I 'll call him at his place later when the game 's over Right . Goodbye , honey .
KID: Listen , Melba
MELBA: I have to tell you first . You 're sitting down with Lancey next Monday night .
KID: I wish it was sooner . I wish it was tomorrow .
MELBA: Shooter 'll give you all the details later .
KID: I do n't like waiting that long .
MELBA: Let 's not kick a gift horse in the teeth , sugar . We 've got this time together . Let 's try to `` fill each unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run . ''
KID: Listen , what I was going to say efore , I do n't want you to think I 'm being some kind of jerk or I do n't feel you 'd be great to sack up with .
MELBA: Then let 's cut the filibuster .
KID: I 've made dolls that were friends of mine 's wives . I figured if they were willing , they were doing it to thei husbands , I was n't .
MELBA: Of course . Any other attitude , you 're degrading the woman . You 're not treating her as a person with a mind of her own , but as somebody 's property .
KID: Only thing is , it 's different with The Shooter than anybody else . He 's so straight , I got the obligation to e straighter with him than othe people . So do you . On account of we oth owe him plenty .
MELBA: I thought we just agreed that what you and I did was strictly between us .
KID: Ca n't be . Shooter 's the closest thing to family I got . It 's almost like he was my old man . Do n't you see how that 's got a bearing on us ?
MELBA: Sure , it means I 'm your mother .
BILL: Shooter very generous of you to come on such short notice . Rosanna you know , and I think you 've met my daughter June . No point introducing you to William the Fourth . He has a bad memory fo names .
SHOOTER: Mrs. Schlaegel . How are you , June . What 's it all about , Bill ?
BILL: Little something I 'd like to sound you out on . But the least I can do is offer you a drink .
ROSANNA: Like me to fix it , love ?
BILL: Wonderful . Why do n't you do a batch of your Bloody Marys ? If that 's okay with you , Shooter ?
SHOOTER: Great . Whatever .
ROSANNA: Just do n't let it get wet again .
BILL: I 've been quite busy on the telephone since I last saw you . There 's a lot of interest all over the country in this game with Lancey and The Kid .
SHOOTER: Betting interest ?
BILL: Jack Doyle in New York is giving twelve to five on Lancey . Same odds in Reno . I 've taken fifty thousand of it so far .
SHOOTER: Fifty thousand !
BILL: I 'll probably go for more but I did n't want to rock the odds .
SHOOTER: I knew you liked The Kid 's style but why you going in so deep ?
BILL: Two reasons . First , I want to see that smug old bastard gutted worse than he gutted me . Second , as long as that 's going to happen , I do n't see why I should n't make some money out of it .
SHOOTER: But how can you be so sure ? The Kid could do it , we both know that , but
BILL: `` Could '' is n't good enough for a man who hates to lose money as much as I do . He 's going to need help from the best man with a pack of cards etween Omaha and New Orleans .
SHOOTER: Not a chance , Bill . You ought to know I never ever use what I got with the cards for nothing but tricks and dressing up a game .
BILL: Sure , I know it . That 's why you 're the man they choose to give them a square deal . That 's what makes it so perfect . Nobody 'll be looking fo it .
SHOOTER: It 's out . Out .
BILL: The great thing is they 'll be so close , The Kid wo n't need much . Three or four key hands .
SHOOTER: Understand this , Bill . I 'd like fo The Kid to win , and I sure as hell do n't want to see you lose all that money
BILL: If I did , I 'd have to collect that twelve grand you owe me . Not myself . My collection agents . You knew poo Wildwood Jones , did n't you ?
SHOOTER: OK but I 'm paying it off ! It 's comin ' in ai n't it ? Six grand already . Bill , you got to listen to me !
BILL: No , I do n't . It 's quite the othe way around . You have some delusion you 're a free agent , but you 're not . I own you .
SHOOTER: For God 's sake !
BILL: Shut up . I 'll cross the twelve off the books and give you ten thousand dollars in cash . And you can tell The Kid if he needs more of a stake , I 'll put it up . Marvelous . Here 's Rosanna with what you need .
BOY: Shine them up for you sir ?
KID: No , thanks .
BOY: Fetch you a newspaper maybe ?
KID: No .
BOY: How about a singy-song then ? I play good .
KID: Play what ?
BOY: Dry corn in this one . Blue shale stone from the river in this one . You ready ?
KID: Yes , I 'm ready .
BOY: You ready ?
BARTENDER: Hell , I 'm ready for anything .
KID: Thank you very much . That was nice . Where did you learn to do that ?
BOY: I picked it up from Herman .
KID: Who is Herman ?
BOY: My friend I pick it up from .
KID: Is he a good friend ?
BOY: I do n't know 'bout that suh . He just a frien ' who teach me some things .
KID: Well , I do n't want a shine , but here 's fifteen cents .
BOY: Thank you , sir .
BARTENDER: And here 's another dime for you , fella .
KID: Yeah .
JANSEN: Monday night , uh , Kid ?
KID: Monday night .
JANSEN: I sprung for some of the action . A yard and a half of that five-to-two .
KID: Thanks , Jansen . Hey !
JANSEN: We got to get you loosened up . I never felt you this tight .
KID: Just tell The Shooter I 'll be there on the dot Monday night .
MELBA'S VOICE: And until then ?
KID: He does n't have to know .
MELBA: I 'm not asking for him .
CHRISTIAN: Hello , Kid .
KID: Can I help you with those ?
CHRISTIAN: Taking if off is harder than taking it on in .
KID: Fine .
CHRISTIAN: You have n't played yet ?
KID: Monday .
CHRISTIAN: This is Eric , Mama . He 's come to see me .
MRS. CRAIGIE: How do , Eric .
CHRISTIAN: We lost suction on the pump right in the middle of canning .
MRS. CRAIGIE: There 's coffee . And sour ham and ead in the warmer , if you 're hungry Eric .
CHRISTIAN: Spring beans , you have to cook them fast . But you find yourself some eakfast .
KID: I 'm all right . Bus stopped fo doughnuts and coffee .
CHRISTIAN: You can stay with us tonight and still make it back to St. Lou on the Sunday schedule by about midnight . I told Mama and Papa about The Man . And all .
KID: Where is Mr. Craigie ?
MRS. CRAIGIE: To the barn . Why do n't you go down and introduce yourself ? Christian and me 'll be at this another hour o two .
KID: I think I will . I think I 'd like that . Okay ?
CHRISTIAN: Sure . And I 'll see you a little late on . Papa do n't know everything . About you and me .
CRAIGIE: Hello .
KID: How do you do , Mr. Craigie . I 'm Eric Stoner .
CRAIGIE: Christian 's Eric .
KID: That 's right .
CRAIGIE: You seen her ?
KID: She 's helping her mother can .
CRAIGIE: You minding to marry Christian ? The Kid looks at him a long moment then
KID: You got any objections if I do , o if I do n't ?
CRAIGIE: Son , that 's what I call a sharp answer .
KID: It was what I call a sharp question .
CRAIGIE: We do n't know much about you , Christian 's mother and me .
KID: I 'm what 's known as a three-rive man . Which just means I go around playing stud poker wherever I can find the kind of action I 'm looking for .
CRAIGIE: You met Christian when she was working to Hot Springs ?
KID: Yeah . I was playing in this game in the hotel and she was a waitress in the coffee shop . We went out . I told her I thought she could get a bette job in St. Louis .
CRAIGIE: Now how did you happen to tell he that ? Maybe you run some kind of employment service on the side ?
KID: I said it because I wanted her in St. Louis . Anyway , she made it there and she called me and we been seeing each other ever since .
CRAIGIE: Living together ?
KID: Yeah , living together .
CRAIGIE: How come she come home now ? She going to have a baby ?
KID: Not that I know of .
CRAIGIE: You two have a fight ?
KID: No .
CRAIGIE: She must have had a reason .
KID: Think so ? Well , you 've known he longer than me . Look , Mr. Craigie , let me and Christian find out a few things then maybe I wo n't have to answer you questions .
CRAIGIE: I never run across anybody like you . I guess I do n't understand gamblers .
KID: That 's all right . I do n't understand farmers .
CRAIGIE: You say things that sound smart alecky . But I 'm not sure if they eally are smart alecky .
KID: Well I ca n't take into account what somebody 's going to feel every time I say something .
CRAIGIE: Are you a believer ?
KID: In some things .
CRAIGIE: I mean in God .
KID: That 's a tough one . I do n't disbelieve in Him , but I could n't say I believed in Him either . I guess I just neve paid Him much mind . Did n't seem important .
CRAIGIE: God not important ?
KID: I do n't mean what He does is n't important if He exists . I mean it 's not important to me whether He exists or not .
CRAIGIE: Christian was raised in a Christian home .
KID: Is that so ? I did n't know - I 'm not aware of the difference . I 'm not asking permission to marry Christian , you know .
CRAIGIE: I know .
KID: If I was , the only person I 'd be asking it from is her .
CRAIGIE: Who is this fella Christian says you 're going to play that 's so important ?
KID: He 's the king of the stud poke players .
CRAIGIE: And you 're going to play him .
KID: Yes .
CRAIGIE: Are you any good ?
KID: I 'm this good . The Man has got to play me .
CRAIGIE: What happens if he do n't ?
KID: Then I 'm The Man .
CRAIGIE: That important to you ?
KID: I been trying to figure that out ever since I set it up .
CRAIGIE: You playing because of money ?
KID: Not really .
CRAIGIE: Christian said you never was much worried about money I been worried about money most of my life up until I figured out it was n't so important .
KID: No , it 's necessary , but it is n't so important .
CRAIGIE: Well how come you want to play this King fella ?
KID: Ambition maybe security , like that .
CRAIGIE: Is it aspiration to be the King o just uncertainty about the future ?
KID: I ai n't looking for security if that 's what you mean .
CRAIGIE: Not trying to lock something up tight and nail it down ?
KID: That would figure into it . But that is n't all of it . It 's important to me .
CRAIGIE: Now son which is more important to you , this king business or Christian ?
KID: If you got the guts to ask that question , Mr. Craigie , I guess I got the guts to answer it . Christian , if you came right down to it , is not as important as doing what I have to do .
CRAIGIE: Well son , I had to know .
KID: Know what ?
CRAIGIE: There never was a man worth a damn , to my mind , who let his woman stand in the way of the thing he had to do . I got to go now see what I can do for a sick heifer . Why do n't you take Christian , when her Mama lets go of her , and tell her I said you should go to the old spring . It 's a good place .
KID: Thanks . I 'll tell her . Craigie walks away .
CHRISTIAN: It stays warm all winter .
KID: We liable to draw an audience ?
CHRISTIAN: Do n't worry . It 's on our land Nobody uses it .
KID: I told him on account of he already knew . Never any sense feeding a man a lie he 's not going to believe .
CHRISTIAN: Even if he did know , I 'm glad you told him .
KID: Hey , you 're all wet !
CHRISTIAN: So are you , foolish .
CRAIGIE: Let me get this straight in my head . Cards is all a matter of luck , who gets dealt the best ones .
KID: The technical term is `` suckers . '' O `` marks . ''
CRAIGIE: Their chance of winning is just as good as yours , except if you got a way to control it , who gets what cards . Right ?
KID: Not right . That 's cheating and it 's not any part of what we 're talking about .
CRAIGIE: Then how do you win ?
KID: I 'll show you . He displays his three cards .
CRAIGIE: What about it ?
KID: This . I put the three cards in a hat and shake them up , and then I ask you to draw one card out blind . Put it face down on the table so neithe of us can see the bottom side .
CRAIGIE: I think so .
KID: So if I said I 'll bet you a dolla to seventy-five cents the other side of that card is red , you 'd take the et would n't you ?
CRAIGIE: Seems like . Yeah .
KID: And that answer makes you a sucker . Because the odds are two to one , the other side of that card is red , and I ought to be offering you a dolla to fifty cents instead of seventy- five .
CRAIGIE: But if there are just the two possibilities .
KID: There are three possibilities . That can be the red side of the red- and-white card , or it can be eithe side of the all-red card . In two cases out of three the other side is ed . And I 'd win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it .
CRAIGIE: You would ?
KID: Sure . It 's obvious when I explain it , is n't it ?
CRAIGIE: Reckon so . Except if there 's only two things that the bottom side can e , red or white
KID: Take my word for it the odds are two to one . And knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker . Not who gets the etter cards but who knows what the proper odds are . In a poker game there can be a million different situations , each with a different set of odds to figure . The man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much
CRAIGIE: The sucker is still took advantage of , is n't he ? The gambler knows something he do n't know .
KID: Sure like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guy 's . Or two business men are in competition , or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom . Whatever your line is , the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better .
CRAIGIE: Seems like there should be something else to it
KID: There is Making the man you 're playing against think he 's got the est hand and making him pay to find out .
CHRISTIAN: I ca n't stay long . Papa 'll be getting up to milk .
KID: I 'm the one ca n't stay . I got to head for that bus .
CHRISTIAN: Why did you come , Kid ?
KID: Well , hell , I do n't know . I had kind of a rough time after you left .
CHRISTIAN: Rough how ?
KID: Tuesday there was a ball game , but then the Cardinals went on the road . I never known time to drag so ; I was all torn apart
CHRISTIAN: Because of the poker game coming up ?
KID: That 's how I read it , but I was eading it wrong . It was n't Lancey or the game that was chewing at my insides
CHRISTIAN: What else is there could give you such a bad time ?
KID: I finally figured it . I located where the trouble was . It was you .
CHRISTIAN: Oh , She kisses him .
KID: When you talk about doing something esides poker if I get to be The Man , you do n't mean pass up the chance to make some dough from it for a while ?
CHRISTIAN: I sure do n't . I told Papa , whereve money comes from , it feels the same when you spend it .
KID: You were going to do some thinking down here .
CHRISTIAN: I done some .
KID: I 'll be back after the game Christian You wait here for me and I 'll let you know .
CHRISTIAN: All right Eric Good luck Monday . She gives him a quick kiss and stands up .
KID: I got that made now . You said it ight . My time 's come .
SHOOTER: Twenty-five years I been building a eputation .
MELBA: Handle this thing right and you eputation will be better than ever .
SHOOTER: I made up my mind to this . I ai n't going to give him any help till he needs it .
MELBA: I 'm glad you 're taking a stand .
SHOOTER: Hey , what if he starts off lucky and stays ahead of the game the whole way . It could happen , you know .
MELBA: You 'll make it happen , Baby . I 've got faith in you
KID: Once more around the square .
LANCEY: It 's a friendly town , St. Louis . I 've always said that .
SHOOTER: We ai n't seen much of you though , last seven , eight years .

LADY FINGERS: Damn right you should ! I 'm telling you , that boy going to make you stomach ulcer bleed before the night is out . He 's close to murder . I seen him give a fella the shakes so bad on a fourth card , it took a pint of corn liquor to settle him down .
LANCEY: Thanks for the warning .
MELBA: Mow the man down , sugar pie , make it quick and bloody . Been too many lean years for all of us .
KID: I intend to take Shooter right along with Lancey .
MELBA: I 'm not talking about the old Shooter . He 's been factory rebuilt . A new spirit dwelleth in him , and his gaze is on distant hills .
LADY FINGERS: So you showed up after all . You 're a aver boy than I thought , so much the worse for you .
KID: You think I 'll be sorry I come ?
LADY FINGERS: Bound to . That Lancey ai n't human , he 's one of them barracuda fish . He 's liable to bleed to death , right on a flush hand before he give up to you . I seen him gut a fella so bad , the fella quit and got up and spit ed in the john and went square .

KID: And I tried to tell him how I got no prejudice . When I 'm on the edge of my stake , I hustle anybody at all , egardless of race , creed or color . Anybody at all .
YELLER: Including my girl .
KID: Hell , I figured I was doin ' you a favor .
YELLER: You did .
LADY FINGERS: Did you know Old Cottonhead died ?
LANCEY: No , I had n't heard .
LADY FINGERS: Heart give out in a high-low game .
LANCEY: How you feel , Kid ?

SHOOTER: Lady Fingers will get three dollars an hour from the ante , plus her room and food , and a five-minute break every hour . Gents ?
LANCEY: Fine , Shooter man .
KID: 'Kay with us .
LADY FINGERS: If you do n't see me when you need me , call room three-oh-eight . You know who else ai n't with us no more ? Miriam , widow used to run the kitchen game to South Chi . Lost two month 's Relief at blackjack , coal dealer cut her credit , and she froze in her bed .
SHOOTER: Gentlemen , this is a game of five- card stud poker . There is no limit . A dead man has one half hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game . The Kid has completed his count .
LANCEY: Five grand ? Nice , tidy sum . I 'll put out the same . CAMERA PANS to Yeller .
YELLER: I swear I do n't know what I 'm doing sitting down with you titans , but maybe it 's worth putting up five thousand for the educational value .
PIG: I 'll play with what I have in my pocket till I have to send out fo more . Twenty-seven , twenty-eight hundred , I do n't know .
SOKAL: Five G 's , I 'm with it . Do n't mean I 'm goin ' blow it all , though .
SHOOTER: Last and certainly least
LANCEY: Ten dollars .
SHOOTER: Dealer folds .
SOKAL: Call the sawbuck .

PIG'S VOICE: Call .
YELLER'S VOICE: Call .
SHOOTER: King to the seven , pair of nines , deuce to the trey , queen-nine , ace- eight .
KID: Nines bet twenty bucks .
SHOOTER: Queen , ten , king , four , ace again , and a king for The Shooter .
LANCEY: Ace bets ten dollars
SHOOTER: King over .
HOBAN: Shooter wo n't stay on a king or an ace if there 's another one showing .
BILL: What 's he have to have in the hole ?
HOBAN: Ten or better . With no other ten showing .
LANCEY: New deck .
PIG: Aces over eights . Thank you , gents . Be a laugh if the two champs ended up cleaned .
BILL: Any action ?
HOBAN: What do you expect first five or six hours ?
BILL: Still feeling each other out ?
HOBAN: Pig 's ahead about a grand , Shoote maybe three hundred .
SHOOTER'S VOICE: King bets .
YELLER: King says twenty .
PIG: In for twenty .
SHOOTER: To the nine a ten , to the queen a seven , to the king a jack , and to the jack a jack .
LANCEY: Pair of jacks will venture a hundred dollars .
SOKAL: I 'm in .
PIG: Up two hundred dollars .
YELLER: Leave it to the rich folk .
BILL: Lancey could be laying for him with three jacks .
HOBAN: Pig do n't think so .
SOKAL: I 'm sticking .
SHOOTER: Possible straight flush , pair of sevens . Pair of jacks are still high .
LANCEY: Check to the sevens .
SOKAL: Likewise .
PIG: Bet the size of the pot . Nine hundred and eighty dollars .
LANCEY: In for nine eighty .
SOKAL: I 'll play .
BILL: What 's with Lancey ? I thought he 'd aise with three jacks or drop with two pair .
HOBAN: He probably thinks Pig 's faking the queens . Anyhow , Doc 's liable take them both with a straight or a flush .
SHOOTER: Busted , no flush , no straight . Pai of sevens with a queen gets a nine . To the pair of jacks , a trey .
PIG: Pair of sevens will bet whatever I got here . Twenty-four hundred bucks .
LANCEY: I 'll call your twenty-four hundred
SHOOTER: Fourteen fifty to the queens . You want to take your half hour , Pig ?
PIG: No , I 'm out . Out of the game .
SHOOTER: You Tap City ?
PIG: I got a woman .
SHOOTER: I thought you and Hilda were quits .
PIG: We 're back .
SHOOTER: See you around , Pig .
PLAYERS: So long , Pig See you 'Night .
PIG: So long .
SHOOTER: He should n't have said that . Not after taking Tap City from the table .
KID: His woman 's been giving him a rough time . Wants him to quit and go square .
SOKAL: At his age ? Crazy .
LANCEY: He wants to wish anybody luck , does n't other me . Personally , I do n't figure The Kid needs it .
KID: Thanks , Lancey .
SHOOTER: I know it 's early , men , but what about taking a little break ?
BILL: It always distresses me , a man eaching his middle years and still having no assurance of next week 's income .
MELBA: I know what you mean . I like a man to have plenty of assurance .
LADY FINGERS: Spider Man died kind of slow . First he give them a kidney , then his gall ladder , and then they taking his whole damn stomach . You remembe Spider Man , run the dice table down at Turk 's Club to Memphis .
LANCEY: Who ? Oh , Spider Man , sure , sure .
LADY FINGERS: He died kind of slow . The Shooter comes to Lancey 's rescue .
SHOOTER: Need your help , Lady Fingers to make arrangements for food and shelter .
LANCEY: Good crowd .
KID: Yeah . Nice-looking broads .
LANCEY: That 's a fact .
KID: That was a pretty thing to watch what you done to Pig with those jacks .
LANCEY: Thanks , Kid . From you , that 's nice to hear .
KID: When he bet out first , he was ready to think you had them back to back . Even when he bet the size of the pot , he figured there was still a chance you were laying for him . But when you called him , I could see it in his eyes he thought you had jacks and tens , and I knew you had him hooked .
LANCEY: You knew , did you ? Before I raised ?
KID: Oh , sure , I seen what you were pulling all along .
LANCEY: You been to Miami , Kid ?
KID: Not yet .
LANCEY: Beautiful town , lot of loose money around . You ought to come down some time .
KID: You mean it ?
LANCEY: Sure , sure . Lot of room down there . Another spot you ought to work someday is Reno , Nevada .
KID: I heard .
LANCEY: You got to have nerves though . So much going on . Action everywhere you turn . You lose the feel of the cards when you 're in so much action day in , day out .
KID: I 'd like to make it out there .
LANCEY: There 's different levels of action there you 'd find yours , any kind you could ask for .
KID: I generally stick to stud .
LANCEY: Sure , sure , for eating money . But you know how it is , I like to lay off once in a while and try craps . Nothing serious I do n't even think of it as work .
KID: Oh , I do that . I 'll take a night off and shoot a little casino . Or even lackjack .
LANCEY: Your age , you do n't need a regula vacation every year . But me , I have to forget the grind for a couple of weeks . I go to this place near Delray Beach , and the whole time I do n't play anything but bridge .
KID: That 's interesting . I could go fo idge if there was a way to do it without partners .
LANCEY: I 'm not keeping you from your woman , am I ?
KID: No . We 're she 's gone away for a while . We 're not sure we 're looking for the same thing .
LANCEY: I 'm sorry to hear that .
KID: I was hoping Christian would run with me and would n't try to make a ig deal out of it .
LANCEY: But she tried ?
KID: Yeah , and now I do n't know . I do n't figure a man can change his way ecause the way I see it a man 's lucky he 's got something going fo him that he can hold on to . A man ca n't change his way for a woman .
LANCEY: Nooo , a man ca n't do that .
KID: I been wondering if it is n't maybe a etter idea not to look for a fixed thing . Just tie in to something nice when you 're away from the action , and enjoy it , and let it wear itself out .
LANCEY: That 's very interesting you should say that . You 're pretty young to have figured things out already .
KID: Well she did n't understand how it was with me and -
LANCEY: Between us ?
KID: There ai n't but a few people , I guess who would understand
LANCEY: Kid , you 're the best stud man I 've seen in 35 years of action . You know that ?
KID: Well thank you .
LANCEY: And when it comes to broads , which is getting to be an academic problem I can look back now to the two o three I ever considered I might want to spend the rest of my life with , and you know what ? I like it looking back on them , that is I always got a lot of companionship out of a good book .
KID: It 's very educational , hearing what it 's like for a man your age .
LANCEY: Glad to be of help . And it 's good we had this little talk so I know we can be friends regardless what happens .
KID: That sounds good to me . I did n't think you was coming in at me like a grudge match .
LANCEY: No room for any kind of emotion in a fair game of stud . I learned that a long time ago .
LADY FINGERS: It 's a whole New Deal . Good hands all around . Prosperity for everybody .
LANCEY: You 're still good , Fingers .
LADY FINGERS: Getting crippled up , Lancey . Not many of the old gang left . You heard Whistling Sam was gone ?
LANCEY: No , I did n't hear .
LADY FINGERS: I was the one got called to the morgue to identify him . I do n't suppose you seen anybody been run over by a twelve- ton bulldozer .
LANCEY: No , ca n't say that I have .
LADY FINGERS: Do n't go out of your way .
SHOOTER: Bet the pot . Four hundred and twenty dollars .
SOKAL: Fold .
KID: It 's yours .
SHOOTER: Thanks , gents . Makes me exactly even . This kind of a game , that 's a smart place to quit . Just do the dealing , if that 's all ight with everybody .
SHOOTER: Ace-king is the high man .
SOKAL: Shoot the works . Nine hundred and thirty bucks .
YELLER: I 'm over .
LANCEY: What have you got ?
SOKAL: Does n't matter . If you can call me , you beat me . Ace-king high .
LANCEY: Ace-king-queen high .
YELLER: I had them both with a pair of fives .
SOKAL: Winds it up for me , men . And I ca n't say it 's been a pleasure . That one I was sure I could steal .
YELLER: Lancey has a built-in burglar alarm . I 'm also withdrawing from the field of battle , gentlemen . Settle for the seventeen hundred I 've already dropped .
LANCEY: Well , just the two of us .
KID: Yeah , just the two of us . Deal them , Shooter Man .
KID: Cost you a grand .
LANCEY: Compulsory call , Kid .
LANCEY: Two pair , jacks up .
KID: Kings up . He takes in the money .
LANCEY: Two thousand dollars .
KID: Call two thousand . He turns to watch The Shooter .
LANCEY: My dear , that young man is a stud poker-playing son-of-a-bitch .
LADY FINGERS: Gettin ' to you , Lancey ? Lancey looks at her a moment , then smiles .
LANCEY: Not yet he is n't . He moves through the crowd , then exits .
THE KID: Now , just what the hell are you trying to pull ?
SHOOTER: Nothing what are you talking about ?
THE KID: You , Shooter Man you been feeding me cards for an hour .
SHOOTER: The hell I was . Christ , Kid , even if I was you could n't spot it I 'm too good a mechanic for anybody to spot it .
THE KID: But I was looking for it , Shooter four times you give me the cards I need .
SHOOTER: You seen it before often enough . One player draws four good ones .
THE KID: Never in a game when I been told ahead the dealer has a stake in my coming out on top .
SHOOTER: My woman told you .
THE KID: She told me enough to make me start thinking .
SHOOTER: Why should you bitch if I give you a little help ?
THE KID: Why , you dumb bastard ? You have to ask me why . I could break you apart for what you 've done .
SHOOTER: Kid , you got to understand . It was n't my idea
THE KID: Well who the hell 's was it then Schlaegel ?
SHOOTER: He 's got the squeeze on me Kid and he 's meaner than hell . He 'll cut me up if I do n't come through . You think I wanted to deal a phony game ? You think it do n't mean something to me ? I never done a crooked thing before in my life .
THE KID: My ass bleeds for you Now you get straight on this . No fix . You come along straight or I blow it wide open .
SHOOTER: He 's liable to kill me .
THE KID: He ai n't goin ' to do nothin ' to you except pay off because I 'm goin ' to win .
SHOOTER: It is a hell of a chance to take .
THE KID: You got no choice .
SHOOTER: He ai n't goin ' to like it .
THE KID: He ai n't goin ' to know . Shooter , I 'm goin ' to win this one win it my way and you ride with me or you 're out , finished .
SHOOTER: I ride with you .
THE KID: You better not forget it now beat it . I need some sleep .
LANCEY: Not yet he is n't . But he damn well might .
MELBA: Good afternoon , sir . It 's exactly four o'clock .
THE KID: I do n't want you to think I 'm getting too personal , but you mind telling me how the hell you come to be here ?
MELBA: You mean you do n't remember last night ? We drank all that champagne and you said `` Let 's get married right away , '' and we chartered a plane to
THE KID: Can it Where 's Shooter ?
MELBA: I locked the door . It 's incredible the way you invariably worry about The Shooter .
THE KID: It 's incredible the way you invariably do n't .
MELBA: Worrying takes time and we do n't have a lot .
THE KID: We 're supposed to sit down again at half past four .
MELBA: Does it really matter so much to you now , that sense of obligation to The Shooter ?
THE KID: I got no obligations to The Shooter . Or to you .
MELBA: Obligations are not what I have in mind .
THE KID: Reach me a towel ?
MELBA: You any idea how much The Shoote has involved in this game of yours ?
THE KID: If Schlaegel bet as much on me as I heard , I guess he 'd pay a nice piece of change to be sure I won .
MELBA: It 's worse than that . Schlaegel staked him for three years . He has his hooks so deep in Shooter Man , he 'll take out his liver when he pulls them out . The Kid stops shaving and looks at her .
THE KID: You asking me to go along with the fix ?
MELBA: I 'm asking you to consider whethe your ego is worth destroying anothe man 's whole life .
THE KID: You 're still working for him . On my time you 're still working for him .
MELBA: What kind of switch is this ? You criticize me for trying to chippie on him , then I get a little loyal and you 're at me for that .
THE KID: No I do n't hold it against you . You wanting to make things right fo him but this game I handle my way win , lose , or draw . There is a KNOCK on the door .
MELBA: Rolls and coffee for the hard-headed hero .
CHRISTIAN: Hello , Kid . Hello , Melba . You said wait home 'til you let me know .
THE KID: Yeah , that 's what I said . We took a eak in the game to catch some sleep . Shooter sent his woman up here to wake me up .
MELBA: Yeah , I woke him up .
CHRISTIAN: It do n't take much .
MELBA: No , I did n't find it any trouble . Well , you children do n't need me , that 's for sure . See you downstairs . You , too , honey , right ?
CHRISTIAN: I 'll be around if The Kid wants me .
THE KID: See you , Melba . Thanks .
MELBA: Por nada , as they say . It was nothing .
THE KID: You been to the place ?
CHRISTIAN: No , I 've got my bag downstairs . Maybe I 'll take it over later on tonight .
THE KID: How 's your Mama and Papa ?
CHRISTIAN: Fine . How 's the game going ?
THE KID: It 's come to be just me and Lancey .
CHRISTIAN: I was wondering .
THE KID: I got my mind on the cards .
CHRISTIAN: I know . And I do n't want to rattle you . We got plenty to talk about , ut it can all wait . Except I want to say this . I came back because I figured if it was going to work with us , it 's silly me sitting home with Mama while you 're playing your big game . I mean if I 'm any use to you at all , this is when it 's most important .
THE KID: I 'm glad you came , Christian . You got as much right here as anybody . More right , I should have said .
CHRISTIAN: Should you ?
THE KID: Hell , yes . The change I come out with when I win this one , you 're going to be the one to spend it . He moves toward the door .
CHRISTIAN: Eric
THE KID: Look , I said I 'm glad you came and that 's all until I wrap this up I 'm a poker player , remember ?
LANCEY: No stay .
THE KID: Two hundred .
LANCEY: No stay .
YELLER: Anything ?
HOBAN: Naaa , Kid paired kings . He wins a hundred .
LANCEY: Queen bets another C-note .
THE KID: Take it away . He looks up at Christian .
LADY FINGERS: I break .
THE KID: I do n't want a break .
LANCEY: Well , I do n't either .
THE KID: Deal .
LANCEY: Same deck is good enough .
THE KID: I want a new deck .
LANCEY: Alright , alright A new deck then , Jesus .
THE KID: Deal .
LADY FINGERS: You want to deal ? Then deal them yourselves . I 'm going to the john . I 'm going to get something to eat , and I 'm going to take a nap . You arracudas can snap all you want but at each other I 'm taking a break and if you do n't like it you can oth go to hell .
THE KID: I guess we been told .
LANCEY: Looks that way .
THE KID: See you in about 3/4 of an hour , Lancey , right ?
LANCEY: Make it an hour . Old bones need a little more time to loosen up .
THE KID: Listen , I think it is amazing you 've een able to keep going this long .
CHRISTIAN: Eric
SHOOTER: Your fan on the fifth floor wants you to have a bite with him . Alone .
KID: There 's nothing to talk about .
SHOOTER: You better , Kid . You do n't , you 're only making worse trouble .
THE KID: If you think so . Sorry .
CHRISTIAN: What 's wrong ?
THE KID: Nothing , Nothing you have to worry about . I 'll see you later .
BILL: I thought it would be better if you and I sat down together to see if we could n't work out our differences . Felix !
THE KID: What I told The Shooter goes .
BILL: Are you saying no before we 've even discussed it ? Am I to feel all my arguments will be wasted ?
THE KID: That 's an argument ?
BILL: That 's a fact . I 'm coming to the argument .
THE KID: I 'll give you a fact . I wo n't let it happen .
BILL: Is that knife sharp enough ? Felix .
THE KID: Very . But it do n't cut any ice with me .
CHRISTIAN: No .
THE KID: Why not , for Chris sakes ?
CHRISTIAN: Eric
THE KID: You should eat something .
CHRISTIAN: I 've got to talk to you . He stops , looks at her .
THE KID: Talk .
CHRISTIAN: It 's about us . What 's going to happen ?
THE KID: What 's going to happen ? What 's going to happen for Chris sake is I 'm going to win the game . You go back to the apartment , honey , this might take two more days .
CHRISTIAN: If I go , I 'm not going back to the apartment . If I go I 'm just going .
THE KID: Well , that 's up to you , Christian .
LANCEY: What 's up ?
THE KID: The Shooter 's not well . He did n't want to spoil the game , but he ought to be resting He ought to be in the hospital .
LANCEY: Well , we got Lady Fingers . Or we can deal ourselves .
SHOOTER: I 'm okay . What The Kid 's talking about is nothing . It 's just not important .
THE KID: It is to me You want to kill yourself , do it on your own time .
LANCEY: I got to go along with that , Shooter . Lady Fingers ! You ready ?
LADY FINGERS: Like Eddie the Dude said on his deathbed , I 'm as ready as I 'll eve e .
LANCEY: I ca n't persuade myself you have the flush . The Kid turns up the jack of clubs .
THE KID: Pair of eights bets an even thousand dollars .
YELLER: Ten bucks and my notoriously fallible instinct tells me the boy is bluffing this time .
HOBAN: Mark it .
LANCEY: I 'm not that curious .
HOBAN: The Kid is pushing it and making it stick .
SHOOTER: He 's getting to him .
LANCEY: Two hundred .
THE KID: And up five .
LANCEY: Fold .
LANCEY: Betting the jack is n't there , Kid . The Kid exposes his hidden jack .
SHOOTER: We 're in I think he 's got him .
LADY FINGERS: A jack and a ten . Jack bets .
LANCEY: Jack is willing to wager two hundred dollars .
THE KID: And up five hundred .
LANCEY: Call your five hundred and five hundred more .
THE KID: Call .
HOBAN: Fifty to one hundred says Lancey paired his jacks .
YELLER: Mark it .
LADY FINGERS: Pair of tens . Jack , ten of hearts .
THE KID: Five hundred .
LANCEY: Your five hundred and up one thousand .
HOBAN: Fifty to seventy-five he 's got the jacks wired .
YELLER: Mark it Could be a high heart . Queen 's the best , but that old man can be cocky with an ace or a deuce . 'Specially having one of The Kid 's tens .
LADY FINGERS: One thousand to the tens .
THE KID: Call .
LADY FINGERS: A third ten , and a nine of hearts to the ten , jack .
HOBAN: He 'll run . He 's beat on the board anyway you look at it . Even if he has the jacks it is better than eight to one against improving .
YELLER: He wo n't run and I do n't think he 's got the jacks . I think he 's going for the flush .
THE KID: Two thousand , five hundred dollars .
LADY FINGERS: Two thousand , five hundred dollars to the three hearts .
LANCEY: Reasonable bet . Two thousand five hundred . Deal them .
SHOOTER: He 's going for it and The Kid 's got him . He 's going all the way .
LADY FINGERS: A queen of diamonds to the three tens . And an eight of hearts to the possible flush . Possible straight flush . Three tens bet .
HOBAN: If The Kid bets into the flush he 's filled up with a queen in the hole .
YELLER: If The Man has a flush or a straight , he goes under . But not with both .
THE KID: Bet what 's in front of me . Make it fifty-four hundred bucks .
LANCEY: Fifty-four hundred bucks is a nice piece of money . I see the bet and raise sixty-seven hundred .
BILL: Kid has him , does n't he ?
KID: I 'm taking my half hour to raise my stake .
LADY FINGERS: I declare a thirty-minute break . Leave your cards and money on the table . The game will start again at five forty-five .
LANCEY: I 'll take your marker , Kid .
KID: I can raise it .
LANCEY: I know you can .
KID: Long as you know . Call .
LANCEY: Straight flush to the jack That 's $ 6700 you owe me , Kid .
LADY FINGERS: Are you playing , Kid ? You got a half an hour to raise your stake .
KID: No I 'm through .
LADY FINGERS: Gentlemen , this game is over .
LANCEY: You 're one hell of a poker player , Kid . That was a rough hand .
KID: Thanks .
LANCEY: What 's the tab for the whole show ?
MELBA: You had to do it , did n't you you had to go for it your own way . Well , sonny , I hope you learned something . I know we sure as hell did .
KID: Where 's Christian ?
MELBA: She 's gone . She 's got too much sense to stick with a two bit loser .
SHOOTER: Shut up . Sorry , Kid .
KID: Yeah . I should have known he had it , Shoote Man . I walked into it .
SHOOTER: Well , Kid , it 's like I said you just was n't ready .
BILL: Are you ready , Shooter Man ? We 're having a meeting and I suggest you join us .
MELBA: Why me I 'm not part of this .
SHOOTER: Oh , yes you are you and your big mouth you 're part of it all right .
SCHLAEGEL: He 's right , my dear . Now run along with Felix . We 're going to have a long talk about that big mouth of yours .
SCHLAEGEL: I was wrong . I figured you for brains . But you 're a loser , Kid . You had a chance to play with grownups and you an . They were n't playing your game . They were playing mine . Think about that while you find a place to hide . But hide good , Kid because I got a message for you and I 'm going to see it delivered .
THE KID: Any time . Schlaegel nods , moves to the door .
LADY FINGERS: Never thought I 'd see the day . You aising tens on a lousy three-flush .
LANCEY: Gets down to what it 's all about , does n't it ? Making the wrong play at the right time .
THE KID: That 's what it 's all about ? You were crazy odds are three hundred to one against .
LANCEY: I do n't play a percentage game . I play stud poker my way . And I got the money and you got the questions . Figure that out . You 're good . But as long as I 'm around , you 're second best , Kid and you might as well learn to live with it . The Kid looks at him and does n't answer .
DANNY: So it ai n't Eric Stone , from the foundry . It 's the Cincinnati Kid King of the stud poker players .
THE KID: No not the King not much of anything right now .
DANNY: We 'll start with giving you back what you gave me . He moves toward The Kid .
DANNY: Tell her good-bye , sport . You ai n't going any place .
THE KID: I know that . He crosses to Christian .
CHRISTIAN: Are you all right ?
THE KID: I 'm fine . Were n't you going to say good-bye ?
CHRISTIAN: I said good-bye .
THE KID: Yeah , I guess you did . You do n't know if I won or lost do you ?
CHRISTIAN: No it does n't really matter . I love you , Kid and it 's not enough .
THE KID: Yeah , I know .

MARIA: What 'd you do with the money ? Go to the movies ?
ALFREDO: Signora Maria , do n't do that . He 's just a kid . And why are you telling fibs ? We let him in free . He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre How much did you have ?
SALVATORE: Fifty lire

IDIOT: It 's midnight . I 've got to shut down the square ! Go away . The square 's mine ! The square 's mine ! !
ALFREDO: Good morning , father . It 's hard on the feet , huh ?
PRIEST: Yeah ! Getting there 's downhill and all the saints help you . But coming ack ! The saints stand there watching you , that 's all ! God 's will be done .
SALVATORE: Ouch ! Ouch ! My foot ! I ca n't walk !
ALFREDO: Of course I knew your father . He was tall , thin , pleasant , and had a moustache like mine . Always smiling . He looked like Clark Gable .
SALVATORE: Alfredo , now that I 'm older , I 'm not saying I can start coming to the projection booth , to the movie houseButmaybe , why do n't we ecome friends ?
ALFREDO: ' I choose my friends for thei looks , and my enemies for thei ains ' You 're too smart to be my friend . Besides , as I always tell my kids , be careful to pick the right friends !
SALVATORE: But you do n't have any kids ! ! !
ALFREDO: All right , all right ! When I 've got kids that 's what I 'm telling them !
MARIA: Stop cryingThe fire is outI 'm hereThat 'll do , that 'll do Miserable boy ! You 're the ruin of me ! Your sister would have been burnt alive if I had n't been there ! And all your fault !
ALFREDO: Butwhat 's it got to do with me ?
MARIA: And who gave him all those films ? Promise you wo n't give him any more of this trash ! Do n't let him set foot any more in the movie house . The oy 's crazy ! Crazy ! All he talks about is movies and Alfredo ' Alfredo and movies ! !
ALFREDO: I give you my word , Donna Maria .
MARIA: God 's got to grant me one wish ! Send your father back home ! And he 'll see you get what 's coming to you !
SALVATORE: Daddy 's not coming backHe 's dead .
MARIA: It 's not true ! No ! It 's not true ! ! ! I 'll show you he 's coming back !
BLACKSMITH: Ah ! I 'll wring all your necks ! ! Or my good name means nothing ! ! ! Lousy ats !
SALVATORE: Signora Anna !
ALFREDO: Give it to me !
SALVATORE: I told my mother you were n't the one who gave me the films . That it was n't your fault . But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me . Now that I know , I wo n't steal any more from you . That 's all I wanted to say . I 'm going .
ALFREDO: Toto , come here .
SALVATORE: Then why do n't you want to teach it to me too ? Now that there 's no more cranking , and it 's easier ?
ALFREDO: Because I do n't want to , Toto ! This is not a job for you . It 's like being a slave . You 're always alone . You see the same film over and over again , ecause you have nothing else to do . And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut ! You work on holidays , on Christmas , on Easter . Only on Good Friday are you free . But if they had n't put Jesus Christ on a crossYou 'd work Good Fridays too !
SALVATORE: Then why do n't you change jobs ?
ALFREDO: Because I 'm an idiot . How many othe guys in town know how to be a projectionist ? None ! Only a jerk like me could do it . Besides I was n't lucky . When I was a kid there was the war ! When I grew up , another war ! Now it 's all different . Times have changed . And you want to be a dope like me ? Huh ? Answer me !
SALVATORE: No
ALFREDO: Good for you , Toto . Good for you I 'm only saying this for your own good Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter . You breathe in smoke , gas fumes , and earn practically nothing .
SALVATORE: But do n't you like anything about what you do ?
ALFREDO: With timeyou get used to it . Besides , when you hear from up here that there 's a full house and that people are laughing , having fun Then you 're happy too . So I 've been wasting my breath ? You pretend to agree with me , but as soon as my back is turned , you do what you want ! Get out of here ! I do n't want to lay eyes on you again ! This is the last straw ! Your mother 's right , you 're crazy ! ! But how 'd he do it ? The little astard ! By watching , he 's learned ! It 's incredible ! I 'm letting the box office know you 're not to set foot even into the theatre ! There are no more tickets for you ! And I 'm also talking to Father Adelfio ! You wo n't e an altar boy any more either ! ! ! You little runt !
SALVATORE: Alfredo , go fuck yourself ! ! !
CROWD: Goal ! ! Holy Mother of God ! ! !
MAN: Ciccio Spaccafico 's won the Sisal ! ! ! ! !

ALFREDO: YOU jerk . Tell me how to solve this fucking problem !
TEACHER: Ssssh ! Silence back there ! !
ALFREDO: Pay attention . This is where it can easily catch fire . If it happens , the first thing you 've got to do is break it off , here and here , so the whole reel does n't go up in fames .
SALVATORE: It tastes wonderful !
AUDIENCE: Fraaaame ! ! Wake up , Alfredo !

SALVATORE: Too bad !
CARABINIERES: Stop ! Go home , all of you ! Otherwise somebody 's going to end up in jail ! ' That 's enough !
ALFREDO: 'Joe ! A mob does n't think , does n't know what it 's doing ' Spencer Tracy said it in Fury . What 'd you say if we let these poo devils see the film , Toto ?
SALVATORE: Wonderful ! But how can it be done ?

GUESTS: Cheers ' Congratulations , Don Ciccio !
AUDIENCE: To the Cinema Paradiso !
PRIEST: How 'd you solve his being under age ?
SPACCAFICO: I took out a license as projectionist , thanks to friends down at the guild offices . But I do n't know a thing about it . Officially , I do the job but Toto earns the money .
PRIEST: Fine . Always be careful , my boy . Do n't eve go to sleep . Be sure another accident does n't happen . Do everything poo Alfredo taught you . And may God bless you .

ALFREDO: Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso ?
SALVATORE: Come in , Alfredo .
ANNA: Toto , will you bring him home when you close down ?
SALVATORE: Yes . Signora Anna . I 'm glad you came .
ALFREDO: How 's school ?
SALVATORE: OK. OK . But now that I 've got a job , I'11 probably stop going
ALFREDO: Do n't do thatSooner or late you 'll be left empty-handed .
SALVATORE: Why ? What do you mean ?
ALFREDO: Toto , this is n't for you . For the moment , the Cinema Paradiso needs you , and you need the Cinema Paradiso . But it wo n't lastSome day you 'll have other things to do , more important things That 's right , more important . I know it . Now that I 've lost my sight I see more . I see everything I did n't see efore And it 's all thanks to you , who saved my life . And I 'll never forget it And do n't put on that look . I have n't gone off my head yet . You want proof ?
SALVATORE: Yes . I want proof .
ALFREDO: For example , at this moment the film 's out of focus . Go see .
SPACCAFICO: Only two days ? Are you joking ? ! What do I care if all the copies are reserved ? Catene for only two days in a place like this ! Why , people will eat me alive ! I know , I know . But even if I start showing at eight in the morning it would n't be enough ! This is a big town now and you people at the Titanus know it perfectly well ! I 'm your sole agent and if I get pissed off I 'll write straight to Lombardo , in Rome ! ! I 'll give you guys a good run-around ! ! If I get my dander up , I can let fly , if my name 's Spaccafico ! !
SALVATORE: Don Ciccio , I 've got an ideaYou emember that old abandoned movie house where they 're supposed to build those low-rent houses ?
SPACCAFICO: So what 's that got to do with it ?
SALVATORE: The projector 's all rusty , but I could fix it in two or three days . Give the place a good cleaning , put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we 'll show Catene in two houses .
SPACCAFICO: What the fuck you talking about ? You getting into the act too , Toto ? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks ! If I ask for two , the least they 'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it !
SALVATORE: Who says we need two copies ?
USHER: That 's enough now ! You 've seen it ten times ! I need the seats ! I wish you 'd all get the galloping runs !
CARABINIERES: Easy ! Easy ! Through the emergency exits , quick ! Stop the jabbering ! !
SALVATORE: Now get running and bring me the first reel . Meanwhile I 'll start showing the news !
BOCCIA: OK , Toto !
SPACCAFICO: Quick ! Give it to me ! Here 's the first part . Get moving !
AUDIENCE: Hey , when 's it starting ! ! We 've got ploughing to do in the morning ! ! Toto , get a move on ! ! Heeey ! !
CARABINIERE: What are we going to do , Toto ? The whole place here is up in arms . They 've been waiting more than a half hour .
SALVATORE: What can I do ?
SPACCAFICO: Where 's the fucking bastard got to ?
SPECTATOR: Let 's get one thing straight , Don Ciccio ! I 'm waiting ten minutes more , and if you have n't started you 're giving me my money back ! !
AUDIENCE: Well said ! Well said ! We want ou money back ! !
SPACCAFICO: Easy ! Easy ! What about my showing you the first part again ? Huh ?
AUDIENCE: No ! First part , my foot ! We want to see how the story ends ! !
PASQUALE: I 've seen the whole works ! You want me to tell you how it ends ?
AUDIENCE: Nooo ! No ! Shut up , you jerk ! !
SALVATORE: Boccia ! Boccia !
BOCCIA: Oh , Christ , it 's so good ! ! !
TERESA: Hey , cut it out ! Go away . Shoo !
SALVATORE: What 'd I tell you ? It does n't catch fire !
ALFREDO: Progress ! It always arrives too late !
TERESA'S VOICE: Come onThat 's rightrelax Do n't be scared
SALVATORE'S VOICE: Is it true that if I bleed I 've got to squeeze lemon juice on it ?
TERESA: There you are ! That 's right , that 's right ! Keep going Ah ! ! ! There , now you 're a real man ! A man ! ? A real calf !
SALVATORE: You know that one there ?
BOCCIA: She 's new . Not bad though . Nice- looking .
SECOND STUDENT: Her father s the new bank director . Loaded , luxury and easy living !
FIRST STUDENT: People who jerk off with a shirt so they wo n't get their hands dirty .
SALVATORE: Look , you dropped this .
ELENA: Oh , thanks . I had n't noticed
SALVATORE: My name 's SalvatoreAnd yours ?
ELENA: Elena . My name 's Elena .
SALVATORE: IIThe other time at the station .
ALFREDO: Chaplin 's Modern Times ! Right , Toto ?
SALVATORE: That 's right , Modern Times .
ALFREDO: I 've shown it so many times I know it y heart . The first time I showed it , in 1940 , was the Sunday my first wife died . They kept it hidden from me all day so they would n't have to close down the movie house . I only found out that night , after the last show . Those are things you neve forget So , Toto , how are these home movies going ?
SALVATORE: Yes .
ALFREDO: What is it , what is it ? What 's the picture ?
SALVATORE: It 's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf . There 's blood all over the floor , like a lake . And through this lake another calf passes y on its way to die .
ALFREDO: Now what can you see ?
SALVATORE: Nothing , there 's nothing . It 's all out of focus .
ALFREDO: Is there a woman ? Tell me the truth There is a woman .
SALVATORE: Yes , it 's a girl I saw at the station .
ALFREDO: What 's she like ? What 's she like ?
SALVATORE: She 's nice . My ageSlender , with long hair , brunette . She had big blue eyes , a simple expression and a little beauty mark on her lip , but eally tiny . You can only see it close-up . And when she smilesShe makes you feel
ALFREDO: Eh ! Lovewhat a mystery ! I understand you , TotoThe ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful . Whatever you do , you ca n't make friends with them . Eh , there 's nothing to be done about it ! The heavier a man is , the deeper his footprints . And if he 's in love , he suffers , ecause he knows he 's up a one-way street . Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants
SALVATORE: What you say is wonderful ! But sad
ALFREDO: They 're not my words . John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills .
SALVATORE: Stinking two-timer ! !
ELENA: Hi . Why are you running ?
SALVATORE: No particular reason Nice day , huh ?
ELENA: Yes , nice day . I 've got to go now . Bye-bye .
SALVATORE: Bye-bye , Elena . What an idiot ! What an idiot ! 'Nice day ' ! Christ ! !
WOMANS VOICE: Yes .
SALVATORE: Is that you , Elena ?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Yes
SALVATORE: Oh , I 'm sorry , I did n't recognize your voice . This is Salvatore , emember ?
WOMAN'SVOICE: Yes
SALVATORE: Listen , I know that every time we see each other I make a fool of myself , ut I 'm not like that , I swear . It 's just that when I see you , I feel shy , the right words do n't come to me , I do n't have the courage to say that all I do is think about you That 's right , Elena , you 're the last thing I think of when I go to sleep and the first when I wake up in the morning . And at night I always dream of you . I know , it 's not good on the phone . But please , do n't get me wrong . Because I love you very much
WOMAN'SVOICE: If you do n't stop phoning her , I 'm calling the police !
SALVATORE: But excuse me , who 's speaking ?
ELENA'S MOTHER: I 'm Elena 's mother , you filthy pig !
SALVATORE: I 'm sorry , Signora , maybe there 's a misunderstandingI
WOMAN'S VOICE: And do n't call my daughter any more . Never !
ALFREDO: I told you , the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult .
SALVATORE: But why ? There must be some way to make her understand !
ALFREDO: Do n't think about it , Toto . Do n't even try . With feelings , there 's nothing to understand .
SALVATORE: Stop it ! I 've had enough of you sermons ! You act as if you created the world !
ALFREDO: Heeey ! Totooooo ! Do n't get pissed off with me now ! Come here ! I do n't know where the fuck I have to go . And the next time be careful how you talk . Not to take credit away from the Lord , but if I had created the world , in all modesty , certain things would have come out better . But unfortunately such was not the case .
SALVATORE: You see , it s like I say . You always have an answer for everything .
ALFREDO: I want to make you happy , Toto ! I 'm going to tell you a story . Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm . Basta , one of the guards , saw the king 's daughter she was the loveliest of all ! And he immediately fell in love with her . But what could a poo soldier do compared with a king 's daughter ? ! One day he managed to meet her and told her he could n't live without her . The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier 'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony , then in the end I 'll be yours . ' Christ , the soldier ran off there and waited ! One day , two days , ten , twentyEvery night she looked out of her window , but he neve udged . Come rain , wind , snow , neve udged ! The birds shat on him and the ees ate him alive ! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he could n't hold them back . He did n't even have the strength to sleep any more . The princess kept watchAnd on the ninety-ninth night , the soldier got up , picked up his chai and left !
SALVATORE: No ! You mean right at the end ?
ALFREDO: That 's right , Toto , right at the end ? And do n't ask me what it means . If you figure it out , let me know
SALVATORE: I 'll be damned '
PRIEST: What is it , Alfredo ? Right now , of all times !
ALFREDO: Father Adelfio , I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul . And you 've got to help me , because I 've lost all peace of mind
ELENA: Father , I have sinned
SALVATORE: We 'll talk about that later .
ELENA: Butwho
SALVATORE: Sssssh , Be quiet , pretend everything 's normal . I 'm Salvatore .
ELENA: What are you doing here ?
PRIEST: But Alfredo , what you 're saying is horrifying !
ALFREDO: I know . But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes , for example ! I think about it a lotHow is it possible for
ELENA: There was a terrible rumpus at home . My mother told my father . And how could you have mistaken my voice ? !
SALVATORE: Forgive me , Elena . It was stupid of me . But I had to talk to you .
OLD WOMAN: Father , I have sinned
SALVATORE: I absolve you in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost . Go in peace , my daughter . When you laugh , you 're even more eautiful .
ELENA: Salvatore , it 's awfully sweet of you . And even though I do n't know you , I like you . ButI 'm not in love with you .
SALVATORE: I do n't care . I 'll wait .
ELENA: For what ?
SALVATORE: For you to fall in love with me too . Listen carefully . Every night , when I get off work , I 'll come and wait eneath your window . Every night . When you change your mind , open you window . That 's all . I 'll understand
PRIEST: You understand now ? You see it clearly ?
ALFREDO: Oh yes , father . Now everything 's clear .
PRIEST: And the next time do n't go around saying such heresy . You survived the fire at the movie house . But no one can save you from the fire of Hell !
MARIA: But why has n't Toto shown up ? The movie house is closed at this hour !
ALFREDO: He had to do something for me
RADIO VOICE: Six , five , four , three , two , one , zero ! Happy New Year ! Happy New Year !
ALFREDO: There 's nothing to worry about . He 's probably with his friends . Let 's toast !
EVERYBODY: Here 's to you ! Here 's to you ! Happy New Year !
MARIA: For Toto too , here 's to you ! ! Happy New Year ! !
ELENA: Salvatore
SALVATORE: That 's nothing to do with it , it 's the car that 's still being run in
ELENA: SO now how do we get home ?
SALVATORE: Hello , Dr MendolaHem
ALFREDO: Toto , are you pulling my leg o something ? How is it possible to see this television without film ?
SALVATORE: Just so , Alfredo . There is n't any . And if you buy a television set , you can watch it at home , without any fuss
ALFREDO: Could beBut I do n't like this usiness . It smells fishy to me .
SPACCAFICO: You see what a bright idea , D Mendola ? But without the bank loan how could I have bought the machine ? If we do n't get organized around here , in this day and age , we 'll meet the same end as the Punch and Judy shows !
SALVATORE: Could it be your father does n't like the work I doThat my family 's too poorIs that it ?
ELENA'S MOTHER: Elena !
ELENA: All right ! ! For the moment it 's impossible to see each otherAs soon as school is out , we 're going to go stay with friends in Tuscany . We 'll be there all summerMaybe if you came up , we could meet in secret
SALVATORE: But we 're opening the outdoor movie theatre this summer . What will I do all this time without seeing you ? !
ELENA: I 'll write to you every day . Do n't worry . I love you . The summer 'll be over and I 'll be back
ELENA'S MOTHER: Elena !
LITTLE BOYS: All seats are sold out ! Free entrance and payment on the way out ! ! Sssssh ! !
ELENA'S VOICE: Salvatore , my darling , here the days never end . I find your name everywhere if I read a book , do a crossword puzzle , thumb through a newspaperYou 're always before my eyes . Today I 've got some rather bad news . At the end of October we 're moving to the city where I 'll attend the University . It 'll be hard to see each other every day . But do n't worry , whenever I can get away I 'll always come running to you , to the Cinema Paradiso .
URCHIN: Fuck me ! I 've caught an octopus ! An oooooctopus !

ELENA: I got back today . You ca n't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here
MAILMAN: Don Ciccio , this is for Toto . Give it him
ALFREDO: What is it ?
SPACCAFICO: Holy blood of Judas ! Now what am I going to do ? ? !
ELENA: So what 'd they say ?
SALVATORE: The army says that , as a war orphan , I do n't have to serve in the military , but nothing can be done . It 's a bureaucratic error . I have to leave . Day after tomorrow morning . They 're sending me to Rome . But they 'll discharge me ten days later . Let 's go
ELENA: No , Salvatore . You 'd better go . It 's my father .
SALVATORE: Good , this way we can finally talk . I 'll convince him this time .
ELENA: He wo n't be convinced , Salvatore . He has other plans for me .
SALVATORE: Who ?
ELENA: The son of one of his colleagues . Do n't act that way . We 'll talk about it later . Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso . I 'll be coming with the five o'clock bus .
SPACCAFICO: Toto , this is no film for the common herd . One day 'll be more than enoughSo tonight , please set up tomorrow 's film , so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready .
SALVATORE: OK
SPACCAFICO: Cheer up , Toto . I 'll be here waiting for you . No one 's taking your jo away from you . Do n't worry !
ALFREDO: You were n't expecting me ?
SALVATORE: No , Alfredo , I was coming to help you
ALFREDO: You were expecting her ? Huh ? It 's a nasty business waiting by yourself . In company it 's better . No ? Then I 'll leave .
SALVATORE: Alfredo , I need your help !

SPECTATORS: Lights ! Christ , what a piece of crap ! ! We want OUT money back ! ! ! Heeeeey ! ! Bandits ! !

SALVATORE: They tell me you never go out , neve talk to anybody . Why ?
ALFREDO: Toto , sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing . So it 's better to shut up . It 's hot in here . Toto , take me to the beach .
SALVATORE: At the Christmas party the lieutenant pinches a girl 's ass . The girl turns around it 's the daughter of the commanding officer . The lieutenant is scared to death and says 'Miss , if your heart is as hard as what I have just touched , I 'm done for !
ALFREDO: Did you ever see her again ?
SALVATORE: No . And nobody knows where she is .
ALFREDO: It was probably meant to be like this . Each of us has a star to follow . So now what are you thinking of doing ?
SALVATORE: Listen to this oneThe commande says to the sergeant 'You emember that windmill that used to e there ? ' 'Yes , sir , I remember the mill 's gone but the wind 's still there ! ' You remember the story of the soldie and the princess ?
ALFREDO: Do like the soldier , Toto ! Go away ! This land is cursed . When you 're here every day you feel like you 're at the cente of the universe , it seems like nothing ever changes . Then you go away , one year , twoAnd when you come back , everything 's different . The thread has broken . You do n't find those you were looking for , you things no longer exist . Is n't that the case ? You 've got to go away a long time , for many , many years , efore coming back and finding you people again , the land where you were bornBut not now , it 's impossible . Now you 're blinder than I am .
SALVATORE: Who said that ? Gary Cooper , James Stewart , Henry Fonda ? Huh ?
ALFREDO: No , Toto , nobody said it . I say it ! Life 's not like you saw it in the movies . Lifeis harder . Get out ! Go back to Rome . You 're young , the world is yours ! And I 'm oldI do n't want to hear you talk any more , I want to hear talk about you .
SALVATORE: Thanks for all you 've done for me .
ALFREDO: Whatever you do , love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little
PRIEST: Goodbye , TotooooooO ! ! ! I got here too late . What a shame !
MARIA: It 's TotoI knew it
SALVATORE: They 're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome !
MARIA: See how pretty the house is ? We did everything over . If it had n't been for you ! Come , I have a surprise . You must be tired . If you want to est , there 's time before the funeral .
SALVATORE: No , Mamma , it only takes an hour by air , you know .
MARIA: You should n't tell me that now . Afte all these years ! I put all your things in here . Go in , go in
ANNA: He would have been happy you came , Toto . He always talked about you . Always ! Right to the end ! He was terribly fond of you He left two things for you . Come see me before you leave .
SALVATORE: How long 's it been shut ?
SPACCAFICO: Six years ago this May . No one came any more . You `` know better than me , Mr. Di Vita , the crisis , television , videos . By now the movie business is only a dream . The city 's bought it now to make a new parking lot . Next Saturday they 're tearing it downA pity !
SALVATORE: But why do you call me 'Mr . Di Vita ' ? It did n't used to be that way
SPACCAFICO: Well , it 's hard to call an important person by his first name . But if it eally matters to you , I'11 call you Toto !
SARA: Uncle , the next time Granny comes to Rome , I want to come along too . I want to see what you do when you work
SALVATORE: Fine . But I warn you , there is n't much to see . I sell much more smoke than fire
ALFIO: Watch out , do n't get too familia with those two they 're worse than cannibals . They 'll take advantage .
FILIPPO: You leaving tomorrow , Uncle ?
SALVATORE: I do n't know , Filippo . I do n't know
MARIA: It must be for youThey 've been calling all afternoon . They wanted to know if you 're leaving this evening or tomorrow
SALVATORE: A double whisky , please .
GIRL: Well .
MARIA: What are you thinking , Toto ?
SALVATORE: I was thinkingthat we 've neve talked , MammaWhen I was little I saw you as if you were already old . That 's probably true with all kids Who knows ? But only now do I realize you were young , you were beautiful , had a whole life before you . But how how could you have lived alone all that time , with no one to look after you ? You could have emarriedWhy not ? At the time I probably would n't have understood , ut I would have later
MARIA: I never had anybody . If that 's what you thinkI did n't want anybody . I always remained faithful . First to your father , then to you , to Lia . That 's the way I 'm made , there 's nothing I can do about it . And you 're like me , you 're too honest and too attached to the things you loveBut I do n't know if that 's a good thing . Faithfulness is a bad usiness . If you 're faithful , you 're always alone ! It 's my fault ! It would have been etter if I had n't called you
SALVATORE: NoIt 's nothing to do with you . It 's just that I was scared of coming ack . Now , after all these years , I thought I was strong , that I had forgotten lots of things . Instead , I find it 's quite the opposite , as if I had never left . And yet , I look at Lia and feel as if I did n't know her , and you , MammaI abandoned you , an away like a thief , thought only of myself , and never gave you an explanation
MARIA: And I never asked for one ! You have nothing to explain . I always thought that what you did was right , and that was that . With no beating around the ush Only one thing made me suffer olting the door shut before going to ed at night
SALVATORE: You never used to do that !
MARIA: No , noWhen you used to work at the movies , I could never get to sleep at night until you came home . Then when you arrived , I pretended to e asleep , but I heard all you movements . Then when you fell asleep , I 'd get up and bolt the door . Then , when you left , every time I did it , I felt as if I had left somebody outside the door , far away . But you were right to leave . You succeeded in doing what you wanted to do When I call you , a different , woman always answers . I pretend I know them so they wo n't have to go through the embarrassment of introducing themselves . I 'm sure they take me for a crazy old woman . But so far I 've never heard one voice that really loves youI would have known . And yet , I 'd like to see yousettled downfall in love But your life 's there . Here there are nothing but ghosts , Toto ! Let it go .
SALVATORE: Boccia !
BARMAN: You want something ?
SALVATORE: I 'd like to speak to Signora Elena
MARIA: Hello ?
ELENA: Salvatore !
SALVATORE: How 'd you know I 'd be here ?
ELENA: Do n't be sillyI 'm old . Do n't look at me like that , please . Why 'd you come back ?
SALVATORE: Alfredo died . Do you remember him ?
ELENA: Of course I remember him . I 'm sorry . You were terribly fond of him .
SALVATORE: I saw your daughter . She 's beautiful ! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her
ELENA: One or two . Bur there 're not all that many Salvatores . I 've got a son , toohe 's older . And you , do you have children ?
SALVATORE: No . And I 'm not married . ( ELENA sits there in silence . A veil of sadness clouds her eyes .
SALVATORE'S: too ) Are you happy ?
ELENA: All things considered , yes . Even if it was n't what I dreamt of then
SALVATORE: Sure , sure ! Boccia What 's he do ?
ELENA: Politics . He 's the district epresentative . We met at the University in Pisa .
SALVATORE: Andhow come you never married that guy from Tuscany ?
ELENA: I did n't want toI had to fight tooth and nail . But in the end I won At that timeI was waiting fo you
SALVATORE: But I 've never forgotten you , Elena !
ELENA: Nor have I . Even though you disappeared But what 's the point of talking about it ? We risk being pathetic and idiculous . You still live in Rome ?
SALVATORE: What do you mean , you were waiting for me ? ! What are you saying ? The last time we saw each other , we made a date to meet at the Cinema Paradiso . You remember ? And you did n't come , you disappeared without leaving a trace , nothing ! I 'll tell you how many years have gone by more than thirty ! ! !
ELENA: I kept that date . But I was late I had a fight with my family . I tried to convince them again that they could n't separate us . But it was futile . They had decided to leave Sicily once and for all . Which is what we did . I did n't know what to do any more , what to say . And I said yes , I 'd do whatever they wanted . In eturn , my father promised to let me see you one last time , to say goodbye . But I hoped that by seeing each other we could take advantage of it and make a decisionI thought we would run away together . My father drove me to the movie theatre . But you were n't in the projection booth . Only Alfredo
ELENA'S VOICE: And I did n't have time to wait fo you to comeback
YOUNG ELENA: All right , Daddy !
ELENA'S VOICE: So I told Alfredo how things stood and fiat I was leaving the same evening , and I asked him to tell you everything . He was very kind , he listened carefully , then
ALFREDO: Easy , easy . Listen carefully to what I have to say . If you want me to tell Toto what you 've told me , I will . But if you want my advice , forget it . It 's etter for both of you if you do n't see each other Dear girl , fire always turns into ashes ! Even the deepest love ends sooner or later . And after that othe loves appear , lots of them . Toto , he ca n't understand fiat now . If I tell him he wo n't believe it , he ' d be capable of killing meBut you can understand , you 've got to understandDo it for him !
ELENA: It 's the first time I 've had to chance to tell the story . I neve mentioned it to anybody .
SALVATORE: Alfredo , damn him ! He cast his spell on you too !
ELENA: I told him I 'd take his advice . But efore I went away I left you that note I was on my way down the stairs
SALVATORE: Oh , how I looked for you , Elena ! You 'll never know . I wrote , telephoned , nothing . Nobody eve answered . But I dreamt of you fo years ! That 's why I went awayand never came back here . Even as the years passed , in all the women I met , I was only looking fo you . I had success it 's true , but there was always something missing I 'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me . A crazy lunatic !
ELENA: He was n't crazy . In the beginning I was upset . I think I really hated him . But then , with time , I understood what he saidand you silence too .
SALVATORE: But I never saw that note ! I must have covered it with my hand , without realizing it , that 's the only explanation
ELENA: What difference does it make to find an explanation ? That 's the way it went . But Alfredo did n't betray you , he was the only one who really understood you . Salvatore , if you had chosen to be with me , you 'd have never made your films . And that would have been a pity ! Because they 're wonderful , I 've seen them all . But you should n't have gone and changed your name . You should have kept your own .
ANNA: These are the things he left to you
SALVATORE: Did he ever think of meeting me ?
ANNA: No , never ! One time your mother said that if he wanted , you 'd have surely come . He got furious and said 'No , Toto must n't come back to Giancaldo , never ! ! ' He did n't say it to be mean . He was a decent man . Who knows what he could have been thinking ? Towards the end he 'd say such strange things . And a moment before he shut his eyes , he told your mother not to let you know .
SALVATORE'S VOICE: Salvatore , forgive me . I 'll explain later what happened . Not finding you here was terrible . Unfortunately , this evening , my mother and I are leaving for Tuscany . We 're moving there . But you ' re the only one I love , I 'll never be with anybody else , I promise . Here 's the address of a girlfriend of mine where you can write to me . Do n't abandon me . Love and kisses , Elena .
ELENA: When are you leaving ?
SALVATORE: This afternoon . Elena , in the future maybe we could
ELENA: No , Salvatorethere is no future . There 's only the past . Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream , a eautiful dream . We never did it when we were kids , emember ? Now that it 's happened , I do n't think there could have been a bette ending .
SALVATORE: I 'll never agree with you . Never , Elena .
VILLAGE IDIOT: The square 's mine , the square 's mine , the square 's mine
SALVATORE: Please check the splices . As soon as you 're ready you can start .
PROJECTIONIST: OK. Congratulations on your film . It 's terrific .
SALVATORE: Thanks .
COLLEAGUE: The distributor is opening up the film earlier . The press conference is in the afternoon . The actors will also be there , the producer , just about everyone .
ASSISTANT: The official notification of the award just came out , but we 've already received a mountain of telegrams . Are n't you happy ?
SALVATORE: It 's all right . We 'll talk about it later .
DARREN'S VOICE: Come on Just a little lower
DARREN: Come on I 'll take good care of you . All the bugs you can eat .
STEVE: Hey , Darren !
DARREN'S VOICE: Shhh
DARREN: You 're gon na scare him away .
STEVE: Man , we 're getting killed out there . It 's three to nothing .
DARREN: Your problem , Steve , not mine
STEVE: GOAL ! Three to one !
EXULTANT: Three to two !
STEVE: What does that prove ? Huh ?
DARREN: Go get the ball . It 's 3 to 2 . Lunch 's almost over .
STEVE: That 's why he kicked it . To kill time . Well , I still got time to kick your face .
BLOCKING HIM: Forget it . The ball .
GOALIE: Thanks , Darren . He 's crazy .
STEVE: You idiot !
TO DARREN: Other . Does that mean not human ?
DARREN: A freak show . Ever been to one ?
GRINS: Just this school .
MR. DALTON: As you can see reptiles and amphibians are not one in the same .
DARREN: Must be a different one . Steve scrolls down through pictures
STEVE: I got ta show you something
DARREN: I do n't get it .
STEVE: Vampires . I 've been studying them . Vampires ? Darren looks at him a beat .
DARREN: Right . You 're failing half you classes at school , but you 're studying vampires .
STEVE: They been around 1000 's of years . Two tribes . They even fight wars .
DARREN: What ? When ?
STEVE: Okay , sometimes , when humans fight ? They fight at the same time . And no one knows it . Like at the Battle of Stalingrad they fought at the same time the Russians and Germans were fighting .
DARREN: That 's your proof ? It smells . Steve 's really trying to convince him now .
STEVE: It 's everywhere if you look . On the internet , in blogs , newspapers , weird places . But you can find it .
DARREN: Come on .
STEVE: Serious . We become aware of
DARREN: What was his name ? Mr. Dracula ?
STEVE: Here he is in 1923 . And here 1855 . Huh ? Maybe he 'll be there tonight . Would that make you believe ?
ANNIE: How 'd you know ?
DARREN: Saw your shadow on the floor . Got ta try harder , knucklehead .
STEVE: I 'm gon na get a soda .
DARREN: Get me one , too . Steve gets up , stomps out of the room .
MOM: I know you want to fight global warming , Darren , but that 's not the way to do it . Steve leans back to show his face .
STEVE: Sorry , Mrs. Shan .
MOM: Oh hi , Steve . I thought you were , Darren .
STEVE: I wish I was .
MOM: Help yourself . She sets her PURSE down on the counter .
STEVE: She 's okay She 's been working a lot lately .
STEVE: I know .
STEVE: I got ta go . See ya tonight .
DARREN: Huh ? Tonight where ? He zips the bag , slings it over his shoulder .
STEVE: Cirque du Freak .
DARREN: I got no money right now .
STEVE: Do n't sweat it . I got money . Meet me ten to Midnight . The Zeiterion Theater .
DARREN: That place is supposed to be haunted . Steve rolls his eyes , starts out
STEVE: Tell them you 're sleeping over . We can meet early , walk over together .
DARREN: I do n't know , man
STEVE: D , it 's Cirque du Freak . You wan na hear about it Monday ? Or see it tonight ? Steve lets his point sink in , then goes .
ANNIE: And that 's why we need a dog .
DAD: We 'll have to think about it .
ANNIE: How do you guys decide who 's going to say no when you look at each other .
DAD: Whoever 's eyes are the widest . And I did n't say no . Yet .
DARREN: Mom ? I 'm gon na sleep over Steve 's tonight ? Okay ?
MOM: No .
DARREN: What ? Why not ?
MOM: Because I said so , Darren .
DARREN: I 'm fourteen . I should n't even have to ask stuff like this .
MOM: The answer is no . And I 'm not sure I want you hanging around with Steve anymore .
DARREN: I 've known him since I was five years old !
MOM: People change and I do n't like the way Steve 's changing .
DARREN: But That 's not fair !
DAD: Stop arguing with her , Darren .
STEVE: I came here after your house . There was a van there , guy selling tickets . Rest is history .
DARREN: You know why they closed it , right ? Years ago a kid fell out of the alcony and died . It 's haunted .
STEVE: Get inside .
DARREN: The balcony . Where he fell
VOICE: May I help you ?
STEVE: We 're here to see the show .
MR. TALL: Ticket .
LOW: He knew my name .
STEVE: Maybe he heard me say it .
MR. TALL: Ladies and Gentlemen . Welcome to the Cirque du Freak . We are an ancient circus . We have toured fo five hundred years
RHAMUS: My name is Rhamus Twobellies . And I do have two .
DARREN: He 's as old as us .
DARREN: It 's him
CREPSLEY: It 's not true . That all tarantulas are poisonous . Though some can kill a man . With one bite .
DARREN: Reacts . A spider !
STAGE: Crepsley makes the introduction .
CREPSLEY: Her name ? Madam Octa . Pray that she never learns yours .
CREPSLEY: Though we have been together such a long time , she is no pet . I think she would quite enjoy killing me .
MR. TALL: Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . That is the end of our show .
AUDIENCE MAN: But What happened to him ? !
MR. TALL: Do n't you know ? What happens to us all , can happen to any of us .
DARREN: Let 's get outta here .
STEVE: No , you go . I 'm staying .
DARREN: Wait . What 're you doing ?
STEVE: This is my destiny . Do n't ruin it .
DARREN: Told by who ? The guy in the chat oom ? The internet guy ?
STEVE: I 'll tell you later . If I can .
DARREN: Steve
CREPSLEY'S VOICE: Are you looking for me ? Steve whirls drops the bottle SMASH ! Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY .
DARREN: Rooted to the spot . Watching
STEVE: I I know who you are .
CREPSLEY: Tell me , boy . Who am I ?
STEVE: You 're a vampire .
CREPSLEY: Too broad a definition . Do you introduce yourself as a human ? Who I am is Larten Crepsley .
DARREN: Moving slightly to get a clearer view .
CREPSLEY: Who sent you and what do they want ?
STEVE: Nothing . No one .
CREPSLEY: Then what do you want ?
STEVE: I want to join you .
CREPSLEY: Join me ? I do n't understand .
STEVE: I want you to make me a vampire .
CREPSLEY: Is it because you want to live forever ? Because we do n't .
STEVE: I do n't care about living forever . But you do seem to live a long time .
CREPSLEY: A long time alone . Do you want to live alone ?
STEVE: I already do .
CREPSLEY: Are you an orphan ?
STEVE: My father 's gone ; my mother does n't care about me .
CREPSLEY: Nor mine . You 're friendless also ?
STEVE: I have a friend , but he does n't understand . He 's got too much to know what it 's like to be alone . As Darren reacts to this
CREPSLEY: The power of being alone will neve e greater than the weakness of it .
STEVE: I do n't care .
CREPSLEY: It makes no matter . We do not lood children . I 'm sorry .
STEVE: Do it . Make me a vampire .
CREPSLEY: Do not tempt me .
STEVE: What 's wrong ?
CREPSLEY: You have bad blood .
STEVE: What do you mean ?
CREPSLEY: I can taste the menace in you lood . You can never be a vampire . You 're evil . Steve scrambles to his feet .
STEVE: That 's a lie . You take that back !
CREPSLEY: Go home .
DAD: Get inside .
DARREN: It was down at the old Zeiterion Theater . Look , dad , I 'm sorry . It 's just , I could n't resist . I
DAD: You told me the other day you were oke . You were looking for a jo to do around the house this weekend .
DARREN: Yeah ? So ?
DAD: Where 'd you get money for the show ?
DARREN: Steve had money . Darren 's Dad 's suspicion is confirmed .
DAD: Steve We were n't going to tell you , but we think Steve stole money from your Mom 's purse yesterday .
DARREN: He would n't do that .
DAD: Mom 's pretty sure about it .
DARREN: Man , what is this ? You do n't want me hanging around with him . Now you say you think he stole money ? Do you know for sure ?
DAD: No .
DARREN: Steve 's had some bad times lately . I 'm trying to be a good friend .
DAD: Being a good friend and sneaking out are two different things .
DARREN: I have to sneak out ! You treat me like a kid !
DAD: Then act like an adult if that 's how you want to be treated . This world is crossed by fences
DARKEN: I know , I know . And you got ta decide which side you stand on . And you ca n't sit on it either .
DAD: A freak show . What do they do , put people in cages for everyone to laugh at ?
DARREN: It was n't like that .
ANNIE: Is he in a lot of trouble ?
DAD: Nothing a few years in prison wo n't take care of .
ANNIE: I do n't see what the big deal is
TO MOM: Did you talk to Steve 's mom yet ?
MOM: Get this . She said she could n't comment because she did n't make it home last night herself .
ANNIE: Where was she ?
MOM: Go tell Darren it 's breakfast .
DARREN: Annie , you got ta learn to knock .
ANNIE: Mom said to come eat . What 's that ?
DARREN: Out .
STEVE: Hey , midget , where 's the idiot ?
DARREN: What happened last night ?
STEVE: Nothing . I hung out in the theate for awhile , but no one was around . The lie hangs in the air a moment .
DARREN: Do n't worry . There 's , you know , no ad blood or anything like that .
STEVE: What ?
DARREN: I said do n't worry .
STEVE: You said bad blood . I never heard you say something like that before .
DARREN: What are you , the word police ?
STEVE: Sure
DARREN: Let me see that
STEVE: It 's Madam Octa .
DARREN: I took it at the show .
STEVE: Liar . Look at the background . This got taken right on your desk .
STEVE: How 'd you do it ?
DARREN: They were loading a van outside . I , I just took her .
STEVE: Just like that You stole from a vampire you know ?
DARREN: Just because he had a coffin does n't mean he 's really a
STEVE: You were there , were n't you ?
NO ANSWER: You heard what he said to me ? That I was evil ?
DARREN: I did n't believe it . Steve studies Darren , hopes that 's true .
STEVE: How do you think he made her do what he wanted ?
DARREN: I wish I knew how to play it .
STEVE: I think that was just for show . I think he used something else . Some kind of mind control .
DARREN: You mean telepathy ?
STEVE: I bet anyone with a brain could do it . Which leaves you out .
ANNIE'S VOICE: Can I come in ?
DARREN: I swear to God , Annie
ANNIE: What ? I knocked .
TO ANNIE: Do n't move .
DARREN: Steve Annie reaches out , takes Steve 's hand .
ANNIE: Darren , he 's freezing .
DARREN: Get dad . Go .
DOCTOR: What kind of spider was it ?
DARREN: I think some kind of a tarantula .
DOCTOR: Where is it ?
DARREN: It got away . Darren 's Dad holds up the camera .
DAD: We have a picture of it .
DOCTOR: Anaphylactic shock . Get Docto Lund . And we need to download a photo to poison control .
DR. LUND: How did you make this and why would you make this ?
DAD: If my son said he took that photo , then that 's the truth . Dr. Lund just stares at Darren . Then
WOMAN'S VOICE: What have you done to him ? !
STEVE'S MOM: Did you hurt Stevie ? ! Did you ? !
DR. LUND: Your friend 's going to die unless we find out what 's in him .
DARREN: Hello ?
CREPSLEY: What have you come for this time ?
DARREN: Crosses do n't hurt you ?
CREPSLEY: Why should they ?
DARREN: Because you 're evil .
CREPSLEY: Am I ? Are vampire bats evil when they drink the blood of cows ?
DARREN: That 's different . Bats are animals .
CREPSLEY: So am I . So are you . Ou appetites do n't make us evil . Why are you here ?
DARREN: Your spider bit my friend Steve .
CREPSLEY: Yes , well , boys who play with things they do not understand can hardly complain if
DARREN: You have to help him !
CREPSLEY: The antidote to her poison is rare . Expensive . Why should someone as evil as I am waste it on Steve ?
DARREN: I 'll pay you back . If it takes 50 years . Whatever it costs .
CREPSLEY: Money does n't interest me .
DARREN: There 's something you want . That 's why you 're here waiting for me . Right ?
CREPSLEY: The night Steve came below to speak to me , you were there . Did you hear what we talked about ?
DARREN: He wanted to become like you .
CREPSLEY: You do n't just 'become ' a vampire . The change is too extreme . And if the shock did n't kill you , you inexperience would . So you become one in stages . A half-vampire at first . With greater strength than a human , but still able to go out in sunlight . You learn from a full vampire . Do you understand ?
DARREN: I think so
CREPSLEY: But your friend has bad blood . He 's no good . There 's no telling what he 'll become as he matures .
DARREN: I do n't believe that someone can have bad blood .
CREPSLEY: And yesterday you did n't believe in vampires . Regardless , I 've left the Cirque . Left my protection . I need someone to protect me while I sleep . I need an apprentice .
SUDDENLY REALIZES: Me ? Crepsley nods .
DARREN: You 're crazy . There 's no way .
CREPSLEY: Then your friend will die . The words hang in the air . Crepsley smiles .
DARREN: Destiny ? That does n't make sense .
CREPSLEY: Try this then . You 're reckless enough to steal , responsible enough to come back for a friend . That 's enough for me .
DARREN: Not for me .
CREPSLEY: Yes , well , destiny ca n't be explained . It must be lived . Now , you 're wasting my time .
DARREN: There 's got ta be another way .
CREPSLEY: There is n't .
DARREN: Please He 's my friend .
CREPSLEY: And he slips away while we argue . Life or death ? Yes or no ?
DARREN: You 'd never be able to trust me . If I got a chance for payback I 'd take it .
CREPSLEY: Yes or no ?
DARREN: How 'd we get here ?
CREPSLEY: It 's called flitting . Which room is your friend in ?
DARREN: What 's happening ?
CREPSLEY: He was near death . The journey ack is not pleasant . What do you know about him , this boy with bad lood ?
DARREN: He 's my friend .
CREPSLEY: Hmm Who 's his father ?
DARREN: Never met him . I do n't think Steve ever did either . Why do you want to know ?
STEVE: Darren ?
CREPSLEY: Will you come with me now or do you have things to set in order first ?
MOM: Darren Wake up , honey .
DARREN: What ?
MOM: The hospital says it 's a miracle .
ANNIE: Boo !
DARREN: Do n't ever do that again .
KID: Hey , Shan , you got ta see this . They duck into the classroom . Darren follows .
STEVE: .Doctor said it was a miracle . They say I 'm unique
DARREN: Yeah ?
STEVE: But first
HEFTS MOUSE: .to Crepsley the mouse .
STOP: Steve hesitates . Darren pushes to the front .
DARREN: It 's cruel .
STEVE: It 's nature . Anyhow do n't watch .
TO KIDS: And do n't blink ; you might miss it . Steve sets the mouse in the terrarium .
STEVE: What happened to the spider ?
DARREN: I killed it .
STEVE: I had a dream . You and Crepsley were in my hospital room
DARREN: Tell me about it later .
STEVE: I 'll tell you now .
DARREN: I said later .
ANNIE: Darren ! Wait up ! He looks over his shoulder , keep going .
DARREN: Got you something .
ANNIE: He 's adorable .
ANNIE: Hey . That 's King .
DARREN: No it 's not . King 's my buddy .
ANNIE: That 's King , Darren . It is .
DARREN: Come on .
MOM: How was school today ?
DARREN: The usual . Sometimes it was oring , sometimes really boring . Darren 's mom laughs . Then
MOM: Ouch !
MOM: It 's okay , honey . I just need a and-aid .
DARREN: You 're different
CREPSLEY: The darkness is n't so scary anymore , is it ?
DARREN: I 'm starting to think it 's me that 's scary . Crepsley waits to hear more .
CREPSLEY: It 's neither here nor there , but , I do feel sorry for you . Darren waves it off , does n't want to hear it .
DARREN: I ca n't just My family , I ca n't let them think I just left them . Or that something happened to me . My mother would She could n't
CREPSLEY: There 's only one thing for it .
DARREN: What ?
CREPSLEY: We 'll have to kill you .
DARREN: I 'm going to bed .
MOM: We love you , too . Do n't we , Tommy ?
DAD: Of course we do .
DARREN: Good night . They watch him go , then exchange looks .
SHRUGS: Kids . Who knows how they think ?
DARREN: Goodbye , knucklehead . If I can ever help you , I will .
CREPSLEY: Your heart will slow down so drastically they wo n't find a pulse . With the fall from the window , they 'll think you 're dead .
DARREN: What if I break bones ?
CREPSLEY: Even better . They 'll mend in a few days . Vampires do n't stay broken for long and it takes a very long fall to kill one .
DARREN: And the funeral home ? Wo n't they embalm me or something ?
CREPSLEY: Do n't worry . I have ways of making my thoughts become the thoughts of others . They 'll leave you alone .
DARREN: My dad 's allergic to grass . It 's my job to cut the lawn .
CREPSLEY: You have a new job now . Drink .
DARREN: So this is destiny , huh ? Tastes like crap .
CREPSLEY: Your breathing is slowing , you heart as well . Do you feel it ?
NEIGHBOR: No , no , come on The Neighbor stops short as he sees the body .
DAD: Darren ? Darren ! A moment later his Mom
MOM: Darren ! Oh my God !
NEIGHBOR: Is he dead ?
MEDICAL EXAMINER: Cause of death is trauma from the impact of the fall . Poor kid .
ASSISTANT: Are we doing an autopsy ?
WHISPERS: Not on a child . Immediately
MEDICAL EXAMINER: I 'm not going to cut open a kid . Not when I do n't have to .
GIRL ONE: He 's still cute .
GIRL TWO: I always had a crush on him .
GOALIE: For the next life , Shan . Top right corner every time .
DAD: I love you , Darren . You said it the other night ; I did n't say it ack .
DIRECTOR: I 'm sorry . I know it 's difficult , ut visiting hours are over .
MINISTER: Ashes to ashes , dust to dust , in sure and certain hope of the esurrection to come
CREPSLEY: On your feet .
DARREN: My legs are asleep .
CREPSLEY: Walk it off . I 'll fill this back in . Go . Breathe some air .
DARREN: What are you doing here ?
STEVE: Vampire hunting .
DARREN: What do you have against vampires ? You wanted to become one yourself .
STEVE: Yeah , I wanted to , but you did . You stole my dream . You stole my destiny .
DARREN: Are you crazy ? I did it to save your life . That was the deal . Me for you .
UNHINGING: Liar . You told him I was evil . You planned this all along . And you 'll pay ! You 'll pay
DARREN: I want you to leave
STEVE: I 'm going to hunt you , Darren . You and the other one . Crepsley . I 'll put a stake in you and burn you to ashes . I 'll make sure you neve come back from the grave again .
CREPSLEY: If we ever meet again , I will show you loneliness you can not imagine .
DARREN: Would a stake through the heart kill a vampire ?
CREPSLEY: Yes . But so would getting hit by a truck if it was going fast enough .
DARREN: Before what 's over ?
CREPSLEY: This adventure we 're on . Shall we start ?
DARREN: Let 's go .
DARREN: How 's that ? Dark enough ?
CREPLEY'S VOICE: Better .
DARREN: It 's sunrise .
CREPLEY'S VOICE: I know the time . I know more about the sunrise than anyone alive .
DARREN: Maybe I 'll wait until noon and then open every door and curtain in the place .
CREPSLEY: Yes , sunlight would kill me . My electrons are different than a human 's . But it would take several hours of exposure . I 'd have plenty of time to kill you before I closed the curtains and went back to bed . Crepsley pulls the blanket up over his head .
CREPSLEY: We can die violently . Accidentally or otherwise . But we also grow old . A full vampire will age one year for every ten human years he 's alive . A half-vampire like you one for every five .
DARREN: I do n't understand .
CREPSLEY: I was born in 1774 . I became
CREPSLEY: Should we do the math or not ? Darren nods . Crepsley motions him to keep up .
CREPSLEY: In Paris . The days of the Terror . Heads in baskets . Guillotines up and down all day . Really when humans put their minds to it , we vampires can hardly compete .
DARREN: But altogether you 're 211 plus 20 . You 're really 231 years old .
CREPSLEY: Exactly . You 're going to be a teenager for a very long time .
DARREN: Where do you keep your car anyhow ?
CREPSLEY: What car ?
DARREN: The one you were driving around my town in . The old black one .
CREPSLEY: I 've never owned a car , Darren . I do n't need one .
DARREN: It was near school one day . It followed me home a few days later .
CREPSLEY: And you saw me behind the wheel ?
DARREN: I could n't see who was driving .
CREPSLEY: It was n't me .
DARREN: What ?
CREPSLEY: Dinner .
WOMAN: Yes ?
DARREN: Go . Run .
CREPSLEY: I put her to sleep . She 'll be like this 15 minutes . When she wakes up , she wo n't remember a thing .
DARREN: Will she become a vampire ?
CREPSLEY: No . She 'd have to share y blood for that to happen .
DARREN: Do n't take too much .
CREPSLEY: A vampire who feeds often can control himself . One who drinks only when he must can end up feeding wildly .
DARREN: What others ?
CREPSLEY: Your turn .
DARREN: No . I wo n't .
CREPSLEY: Darren
DARREN: I 'll never do it .
CREPSLEY: You can lead a vampire to blood , ut you ca n't make him drink .
DARREN: I 'm only half-vampire .
CREPSLEY: No matter , you need blood to live now . You 'll drink eventually . When you 're hungry enough .
DARREN: I 'll die first .
ANGER FLASHING: Do n't be stupid . You may abstain tonight , but you must feed soon .
DARREN: What is it ? As the woman starts to stir
CREPSLEY: Nothing . Let 's go .
DARREN: Something out there scares you . What is it ?
CREPSLEY: The thought of spending anothe minute with you . Crepsley turns and walks , but Darren 's right .
DARREN: The blood I wanted it . I wanted to drink it .
CREPSLEY: Of course you did ! You 're a
DARREN: Thank you .
DARREN: The car Crepsley follows the finger as Darren points .
STEPPING UP: Darren Shan , we meet at last .
MR. TINY: You 're quite a boy . Sacrificed everything to save a friend .
DARREN: Where 'd you hear that ?
MR. TINY: A little bat told me .
DARREN: Who is ?
MR. TINY: Crepsley . Trying to stay alive .
DARREN: See what ? The air seems to buzz as something 'passes ' .
MR. TINY: Why the fight of course . Boys like to watch fights , do n't they ?
MURLOUGH: Smell the blood . The lovely blood .
DARREN'S POV: Murlough follows . Closing ground .
DARREN: It 's behind us !
RUSHING OVER: Hey , man , are you okay ? !
CREPSLEY: Find a blanket . A rug . Cover it .
DARREN'S VOICE: Are you okay ?
CREPSLEY: My arm 's broken . But it should be fine in a day or two .
DARREN: Who were they ? Vampires ?
CREPSLEY: No . The one with the watch was Mr . Tiny . Very dangerous .
DARREN: How dangerous can a man named Mr . Tiny be ?
CREPSLEY: Who said he was a man ?
DARREN: Then what is he ?
CREPSLEY: Mr . Tiny ca n't be explained . He needs to be experienced .
FRUSTRATED: And the purple guy . What was he ?
CREPSLEY: A vampaneze .
DARREN: Yeah ? Keep talking .
CREPSLEY: Long ago humans were looked upon as animals by some vampires . Cattle to be slaughtered . Laws were passed to forbid needless killing . It made it easier to pass unnoticed among humans if we did n't murde them . Most vampires obeyed
DARREN: But some did n't ?
CREPSLEY: Seventy vampires broke away , declared themselves a separate ace . The Vampaneze . Over time their appearance changed , thei numbers grew . They believe it 's wrong to feed from a human without killing it .
DARREN: What ? That 's crazy .
CREPSLEY: They believe those of us who feed in small amounts live like leeches . In shame . It led to war .
A BEAT: Will you be alright while I sleep ?
DARREN: Oh yeah This is so much bette than where I used to be
CREPSLEY: What do you think of rejoining the Cirque du Freak ? Until you get on your vampire feet so to speak .
DARREN: Half vampire .
CREPSLEY: Yes , yes . Three-eighths if you want . What do you think ? As Darren thinks
MR. TALL: Show time in twenty minutes . Someone tell Rhamus to get his stomachs in gear !
DARREN: I liked it better where I was .
MR. TALL: I 'm sure .
CREPSLEY: Do you still have my coffin ?
MR. TALL: Of course . You 're really back ?
CREPSLEY NODS: Perhaps you could do the show tonight ? A few of us are absent o ill this evening .
CREPSLEY: I 'd be delighted .
MR. TALL: Mr. Shan will have to pull his weight as well . I 'll give him to Evra . Evra ! EVRA !
LOOKING ABOUT: I hope I have n't gone from one unreliable boy to two .
MR. TALL: Evra , my industrious wonder . Here is Darren . Put him to work with you . Show him the snakey ropes . As the two boys consider each other
CREPSLEY: You do n't approve ?
MR. TALL: I do n't matter . What will the vampire generals say when they hea about it ?
CREPSLEY: I 'm no longer part of their domain .
MR. TALL: So you say . They may disagree .
EVRA: What do you do ? Me ? I 'm a snake oy . I do a whole snake thing .
DARREN: Do you eat mice ?
EVRA: Big Macs actually .
DARREN: I caught your act in the last town . Pretty cool .
EVRA: Thanks . I 'm not doing it tonight . My snake caught a cold .
DARREN: Snakes can catch cold ? Evra nods , then SNEEZES himself .
EVRA: Still got ta work the floor though . Ushers . We get the seats filled .
DARREN: Who are they all ?
EVRA: The backbone of Cirque du Freak . They do the driving , the tent pitching , the potato peeling even .
DARREN: How did they end up here ?
EVRA: Most wandered in . If Mr . Tall likes them , they stay .
DEBBIE: Are there any left ?
EVRA: Only the best seats in the house .
DEBBIE: You guys are with the Cirque ?
SAM: Cirque is French , right ? Are you guys French ?
EVRA: Oui . Vous etes observateur . Nous sommes les serpents frangais .
DEBBIE: Cool I 'm Debbie , this is Sam .
EVRA: Evra Von . She looks at Darren , waiting .
DARREN: Oh , I 'm Darren .
DEBBIE: Is the show great ? Say yes . We had to sneak out to see it .
DARREN: I snuck out to see it once , too . And I 'm still here . An odd , almost spooky moment . Is he serious ?
SAM: Good one , Darren . Hey . Debbie and Darren . Like Bonnie and Clyde . And their friend Evra Von what ?
DARREN: You have no idea
MR. TALL: Welcome to the Cirque du Freak . We are an ancient circus . Bringing the remarkable to generations
DARREN: How long have you known Mr . Tall ?
EVRA: Five years .
DARREN: How do you meet someone like him ?
EVRA: I was raised in a circus , but not a nice one like this . The owner used to beat me and keep me in a glass cage . I felt like a useless freak . One night I looked out of my cage and saw Mr . Tall just standing there . He watched me until the owner came over and asked if he could help him . Mr . Tall grabbed him by the throat and strangled him to death . Then he opened the cage and said , `` Let 's go , Evra . '' He named me that . I added the Von . I 've been with him ever since .
CREPSLEY'S VOICE: Darren
CREPSLEY: How do you feel about show usiness ?
CREPSLEY: Look glum Miserable
DARREN: Almost done .
CREPSLEY: Darren
CRESPLEY: Mattress .
DARREN: I just felt sick for a second .
CREPSLEY: You need blood .
DARREN: You think Mr . Tiny might come ? Crepsley shrugs , does n't answer .
CREPSLEY: What we want is who we are , do n't you think ?
DARREN: Ca n't you give me a straight answe just once ? !
CREPSLEY: You wo n't learn by me telling you . You must live some things to know what they are .
DARREN: No . I never thought about it .
CREPSLEY: That 's the trouble with children . They do n't think about things .
DARREN: I 'm not a child . Theystop by the shadows .
CREPSLEY: Are you a man ? If you 're not a man , you 're a child .
DARREN: I 'm in between .
CREPSLEY: In between does not exist !
VOICE: And old vampires ?
CREPSLEY: Gavner Purl , as always I heard you coming from a mile away .
VOICE: We 'll call it a draw then .
GAVNER PURL: It 's been too long , Larten .
CREPSLEY: Decades now . They embrace . Darren 's trying to catch up .
DARREN: You guys are friends ?
GAVNER PURL: I suppose . We once shared a coffin together . For six months .
SARCASTIC: Like roommates ? To save money ?
GAVNER PURL: We were being hunted .
DARREN: Who was hunting you ?
CREPSLEY: Never mind . Darren , Gavner Purl .
GAVNER PURL: A half-vampire ?
CREPSLEY: Of course . We do n't make full vampires of our assistants . Gavner Purl looks at Crepsley , stunned .
GAVNER PURL: Nor do we make assistants of children .
LOSING IT: A child , Larten ? Why ? !
CREPSLEY: I have my reasons .
GAVNER PURL: And they are ?
CREPSLEY: I do n't owe answers to vampires anymore . I 'm exiled from our kind
GAVNER PURL: Self-exiled . And I at least am owed an answer .
CREPSLEY: All I care to say is a boy sought me out , knew who I was . He asked me to make him my assistant . Gavner looks to Darren , suspicious .
GAVNER PURL: And how did you know
GAVNER PURL: How could a boy find you ? Crepsley shrugs . Of course he had help .
DARREN: He tried to kill us .
CREPSLEY: He tried to kill me . What he wanted with you was n't determined .
GAVNER PURL: Perhaps you chose the wrong boy . In Mr . Tiny 's eyes .
DARREN: What are you guys talking about ! ?
CREPSLEY: What 's important enough to track down an exile ? What is your news ?
GAVNER PURL: War .
CREPSLEY: I 'm not interested in your wars .
GAVNER PURL: Well the other side is interested or they would n't be trying to get id of you . Crepsley gets suddenly very angry .
CREPSLEY: I 've had enough killing ! No more ! You 've come to the wrong place . I am the wrong place Gavner raises his hands in surrender .
GAVNER PURL: Even so , I 'm glad you 're alive .
RELENTING: The sun is coming . Will you stay ?
GAVNER PURL: I can still make miles . The wa wo n't wait . And neither will bad news . I have to go .
CREPSLEY: Then travel safely .
GAVNER PURL: Would you mind if I walk a bit with your assistant ?
CREPSLEY: Take him with you if you want . He 's of little use to me .
GAVNER PURL: You look sick . Does n't Larten feed you ?
DARREN: I wo n't drink blood if that 's what you mean . I promised myself .
GAVNER PURL: Why ?
DARREN: You 'll get insulted . As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him
GAVNER PURL: The only thing drinking blood will do to you is keep you alive .
DARREN: That 's how it would start . I would swear it was just to stay alive . But what 'll I turn into ? You 're on one side of the fence or the other . My father used to say that and now I know what he meant . The 'father part ' chokes Darren up a bit .
GAVNER PURL: You 've already turned , Darren . You need to accept what you 've already ecome . There 's no going back . They walk in silence a moment . Then
DARREN: Why did Crepsley make himself an exile anyhow ?
GAVNER PURL: He was tired of all the killing . We were at war .
DARREN: With the vampaneze ?
GAVNER PURL: Crepsley was once a Vampire General . One of our great leaders . He may seem reluctant , but I assure you , no one is as skilled at killing vampaneze than Crepsley is . I think that 's why they 'd like to get him out of the way . Kill him off before the new war starts .
DARREN: You 've known him a long time ?
GAVNER PURL: I was his assistant . He blooded me , as he blooded you .
DARREN: Why 'd he choose you ?
GAVNER PURL: To teach me to kill vampaneze . Up until now , it 's the only reason he ever chooses anyone .
DARREN: Is it why he chose me ? Gavner hesitates , not sure .
GAVNER PURL: That 's for Crepsley to say . Not me . Another brick wall , but Darren accepts it .
DARREN: The vampaneze ? Mr . Tiny ?
GAVNER PURL: No . It 's that they live so long they no longer care . Everything they love is left behind until they finally have nothing left to live for . Except death . The fact that he 's taken an apprentice seems , to me , a good sign . A sign that he 's thinking of living not dying .
DARREN: Lucky for me . Glad I could help .
GAVNER PURL: A clear run . Good . Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look .
DARREN: That part is definitely cool .
ARRIVING: What 's up ?
DARREN: Nothing .
SNIFFS AIR: It 's smells like burnt hair .
DARREN: Do n't know . I 'm congested .
SEES SOMETHING: Hey
THEIR POV: Debbie and Sam ducking inside the factory .
EVRA: Let 's scare the crap out of him
DEBBIE: You should see the look on you faces . But Evra and Darren are not laughing .
EVRA: What 're you doing here ?
DEBBIE: We could ask you the same thing . We come here all the time . My grandfather used to work here .
DARREN: Must 've been a long time ago .
DEBBIE: He says now it 's like one of those ombed out World War II cathedrals . Empty of what is used to be . An odd little moment till Sam breaks it .
SAM: Hey , we loved the show , man . It was off the hook .
EVRA: Off the hook , huh ? I 'll tell all the freaks you said so .
SAM: Are you guys on your own ? Just traveling . No parents or nothing ?
DARREN: No . No parents .
SAM: School ?
EVRA: No school either .
SAM: You 're the luckiest guys on earth . Wan na switch places ?
DARREN: You have to be different to be here .
DEBBIE: Different how ?
EVRA: Everyone has a place they belong . The Cirque du Freak is ours .
DEBBIE: I think your skin is beautiful . That wins Evra over .
DARREN: He 's a snake-boy .
DEBBIE: You should n't call him names ecause he looks different .
EVRA: It 's okay . I am a snake boy .
SAM: You could say you 're dermatologically challenged .
DEBBIE: What about you , Darren ? How are you different ?
DARREN: I get scared easy .
DEBBIE: You mean , how did a girl get up there ?
EVRA: Hey , be careful .
SAM: Do n't worry . She 's like a gymnast .
DARREN: You 're crazy !
DEBBIE: How about you ?
DARREN: I got nothing to prove .
DEBBIE: But it 'd be easier for you than me .
DARREN: Why 's that ?
DEBBIE: Because chickens have wings .
DEBBIE: Let 's play mirrors .
DARREN: What 's that ?
DEBBIE: I do something and you have to copy me . Like this .
EVRA: Come on , guys
DEBBIE: There definitely something different about you . I just ca n't figure it out .
DARREN: Is Sam your boyfriend ?
DEBBIE: He 's my cousin .
DARREN: Oh
DEBBIE: Hold on .
SAM: I do n't think it 'll hold you , dude .
EVRA: Thanks for the heads up Bro .
DARREN: It 's okay . I 'm okay .
DEBBIE: I do n't know how you hung on . I could n't have .
DARREN: You would n't have fallen in the first place I just got dizzy .
DEBBIE: Maybe you need to eat something . Darren looks at her . She has no idea .
EVRA: Well , the food 's down on ground level . Let 's get out of here .
DARREN: She 's kind'of cool , huh ? I mean , for a girl .
EVRA: I like her . She asks a lot of questions though .
DARREN: She 's just curious .
EVRA: There 's no such thing as 'just ' with a girl .
DARREN: What makes you such an expert ?
EVRA: My snake 's a girl .
CREPSLEY: Good morning , Darren .
DARREN: What 's good about it ?
SAM DEBBIE: Hey , Darren . Hi Darren 's happy to see them .
DARREN: You guys are coming to the show again tonight ?
DEBBIE: Of course . Evra 's doing his snake act tonight .
DARREN: Oh , you came to see Evra .
DEBBIE: And you Darren smiles shyly at that .
SAM: I was hoping for Amanda Bynes .
DARREN: Hey , I 'll catch up with you later . I got some stuff I got ta finish up .
SAM: He 's gon na be gone in another day or two . Tonight 's the last show .
DEBBIE: I know that . So ?
SAM: So stop looking at him like you love him .
DEBBIE: You 're such an idiot , Sam .
TENT OPENING: Darren joins Crepsley , a little unsteady .
CREPSLEY: Look at you . You can barely stand .
DARREN: I 'm fine .
CREPSLEY: You need to feed . You need blood..
DARREN: No ! I wo n't let you hunt some poo person down for me . I
CREPSLEY: No need to hunt . There 's someone here willing to save you .
MADAM TRUSKA: By my own free will , Darren Shan .
CREPSLEY: Drink or you 'll die .
DARREN: No . I ca n't . I 'm human . Crepsley releases Truska 's arm .
CREPSLEY: You 're not ! And you 'll be nothing !
DARREN: I am human . In my heart I am .
VOICE: An usher in the house of usher . And I ca n't seem to find a seat .
DARREN: This way .
MR. TINY: Join me .
DARREN: I do n't think so .
MR. TINY: It 's time we had a few moments . Folks involved in epic struggles should get to know each other . Darren does n't answer .
DARREN: He said you ca n't be explained . You need to be experienced .
MR. TINY: He gives me too much credit .
DEBBIE: Hey , Darren .
SAM: Cuz we miss you so much .
WHISPERS: Choosing sides can only lead to trouble . Never , ever choose sides unless it 's your own .
DARREN: You 've chosen the vampaneze . Mr . Tiny laughs , slaps his knee even .
MR. TINY: Is that really what you think ? A smart boy like you ?
MR. TALL: Ladies and Gentlemen
MR. TINY: .subjugators and saps
MR. TALL: Welcome to the Cirque du Freak . We are an ancient circus As Mr . Tall drones on
MR. TINY: Oh , his speeches are impossible .
DARREN: Terrible profits .
MR. TINY: Excellent . I am a profiteer . I exact fees and gains . I 'm simple .
DARREN: What prophesy ?
MR. TINY: They say the final battle between vampires and vampaneze will be decided by a child . That 's why the vampires wo n't blood children . To avoid the end of the world . As these words are pondered by Darren
DARREN: I think you 're a creep . I think you suck .
MR. TINY: Too bad .
DEBBIE: He was great !
MURLOUGH: Is it Dar-wren 's girlfriend ?
DARREN: Forget about her
MURLOUGH: She has plenty of lovely blood inside . Inside , outside , hmmm ?
ALMOST SHY: Murlough is a vampire killer .
DARREN: You guys are in trouble . There 's more than one vampire now . Gavne Purl is here .
MURLOUGH: Have you seen Purl Gavner 's face ? Young Murlough sliced it for him .
MR. TINY: Darren , you 're a liar . He 's a thousand miles gone by now . And master Crepsley is right there . As he points at Crepsley
MURLOUGH: Shimmers , phases into flit mode . Disappears .
DARREN: Crepsley ! Look out !
STAGE: As Murlough 'appears ' alongside Crepsley .
DARREN: Concentrating . Trying to flit .
CREPSLEY: Reacting to Murlough 's voice .
MURLOUGH: Crepsley will come for his assistant .
DARREN: He does n't care about me .
MURLOUGH: Murlough has an assistant , too . A smart one , smarter than you .
DARREN: Steve ?
STEVE: Mr . Tiny made my dream come true . Only better . I 'm half vampaneze instead of a stupid half vampire . Mr . Tiny says I have a destiny . He says he 's gon na make sure of it .
DARREN: Is that who you talked to ? Was that the internet guy ? Mr . Tiny ?
LAUGHS: Pretty funny , huh ? He introduced himself after you left town .
STEVE: He gave me back the dream you stole .
MURLOUGH: Crepsley comes .
SAM: Where 'd he go ?
CREPSLEY: Evra Get them out of here .
EVRA: You guys better go back .
SAM: What are you gon na do ?
EVRA: Darren 's my friend .
DEBBIE: Ours too . Sam 's not so sure , but he nods in agreement .
BOILER ROOM: Crepsley speaks to 'the room ' .
CREPSLEY: I can smell it . Why does it hide ?
STEPPING UP: The vampire is here .
MURLOUGH: The vampire will die .
FROM ABOVE: Let 's get readyyyyy to rumble ! Crepsley looks up , reacts .
CREPSLEY: Even the creatures of the night watch too much TV .
EVRA: Sam , unhook his legs .
DARREN: Are you guys nuts ? Get outta here !
EVRA: It 's against our code .
EVRA: Come on !
DARREN: Evra . I think I 'm dying . He looks horrible .
DEBBIE: Let 's carry him if we have to .
EVRA: It 's okay . It 's the wolfman . He 's in his cage .
STEVE: Ooops
DEBBIE: Reacts in horror .
DARREN: Oh Sam . Oh no Darren crawls over , takes Sam 's bloody hand .
SAM: Go save Debbie , Darren
DARREN: Forgive me , Sam , but I need strength . I need blood .
STEVE: Is Crepsley dead ?
MURLOUGH: Who knows ? Young Murlough lives , ut he 's hurt .
STEVE: What can I do ?
MURLOUGH: What can Dar-wren 's girlfriend do ? We need to get the blood inside outside . Do n't we ?
DARREN: Let her go .
STEVE: Stop being a big shot . This is n't like stopping some fight at school .
DARREN: Shut up , Steve .
MURLOUGH: You need to stand still so you can die .
STEVE: Stay back ! Or I 'll throw her off ! I mean it !
DARREN: It 's over , Steve .
STEVE: Is it ?
DARREN: Liar .
SMILES: And your sister . She was moving into your room . They had a yard sale . I bought some of your stuff .
DARREN: Did you steal money from my mom 's purse ?
STEVE: What ?
DARREN: Did you ?
STEVE: Why do you ask ? Is knowing that gon na help you rest in peace ?
DARREN: No . It 's just practically the last thing that ever happened between me and my dad was I was arguing with him .
FLIP: Least you had a dad to argue with . A fury building in Darren .
DARREN: I was telling him he was wrong about you . That 's the last time we had together . Fighting about you .
STEVE: Hate to tell ya . Your dad was ight . How do you think we got the money for the dumb tickets ? I took it . Just like I 'm gon na take you .
DARREN: I miss him .
CREPSLEY: Kill him , Darren . Do it now so you wo n't have to do it later .
SOFTLY; SADLY: No . He used to be my friend .
DARREN: Start running . Do n't ever stop .
STEVE: Next time And he 's gone . Disappearing into the dark . Darren joins Debbie . Nothing left to hide .
DEBBIE: Sam ? Darren shakes his head . Sam did n't make it .
DARREN: Are you gon na be okay ?
CREPSLEY: I just need to catch my breath . For a few days . Maybe a week .
DARREN: You think I made a mistake , do n't you ?
CREPSLEY: No . I think that you proved yourself human after all .
DARREN: Half human . What now ?
CREPSLEY: What do you mean ?
DARREN: There 's a war on , is n't there ? Crepsley shrugs .
CREPSLEY: Yes , yes . Black and white fences crossing very gray fields .
DARREN: It 's not gray . I 've met the bad guys . They need to be stopped .
CREPSLEY: I 'm not sure it 's my fight .
DARREN: But you said it . There 's no in etween . And the power of being alone is never going to be greate than the weakness . It 's our fight .
A WHISPER: He was a good kid . It 's weird , but I remember things about him even though I was n't there when they happened . Even though it 's impossible .
CREPSLEY: His blood is in you .
MR. TALL: I 'll deal with the police when they come . What I 'll say , I do n't know .
DEBBIE: Say what happened . Some crazy guy showed up . Sam was in the wrong place at the wrong time . They 're all quiet a moment .
EVRA: He was brave .
SADLY: For the only time in his life .
DARREN: He did n't die in vain . A beat .
MR. TALL: Time to fly or flit or whatever you call it . The sun wo n't wait all night .
CREPSLEY: Actually , that 's exactly what it does .
MR. TALL: Time will tell what this night has ought us .
CREPSLEY: Yes . Keep my coffin ready , would you ?
MR. TALL: Always .
DEBBIE: Do you think we 'll meet again ?
DARREN: You never know .
DEBBIE: I hope so
WHISPERS BACK: Hope is a good word . I hope so , too .
DARREN: Where are we going ?
CREPSLEY: To meet the Vampire Generals . Wa clouds are forming . A storm is coming . And I have a feeling you 're needed much more than I am .
DARREN: So what are we waiting for ? Let 's go . Crepsley offers his hand .
CREPSLEY: Take my arm . Darren shakes his head , does n't need it . He shimmers , flits into the night . Crepsley laughs to himself . As he follows
NARRATOR: Here , for Xanadu 's landlord , will e held 1940 's biggest , strangest funeral ; here this week is laid to est a potent figure of our Century - America 's Kubla Kahn - Charles Foster Kane . In journalism 's history , other names are honored more than Charles Foster Kane 's , more justly revered . Among publishers , second only to James Gordon Bennet the First his dashing , expatriate son ; England 's Northcliffe and Beaverbrook ; Chicago 's Patterson and McCormick ;
NARRATOR: Kane 's empire , in its glory , held dominion over thirty-seven newpapers , thirteen magazines , a adio network . An empire upon an empire . The first of grocery stores , paper mills , apartment uildings , factories , forests , ocean-liners - An empire through which for fifty years flowed , in an unending stream , the wealth of the earth 's third richest gold mine Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune How , to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane , by a defaulting boarder , in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mine shaft The Colorado Lode . The magnificent Enquirer Building of today .
NARRATOR: Fifty-seven years later , before a Congressional Investigation , Walte P. Thatcher , grand old man of Wall Street , for years chief target of Kane papers ' attack on `` trusts , '' ecalls a journey he made as a youth Shot of Capitol , in Washington D.C .
THATCHER: because of that trivial incident
INVESTIGATOR: It is a fact , however , is it not , that in 1870 , you did go to Colorado ?
THATCHER: I did .
INVESTIGATOR: In connection with the Kane affairs ?
THATCHER: Yes . My firm had been appointed trustees by Mrs. Kane for the fortune , which she had recently acquired . It was her wish that I should take charge of this boy , Charles Foster Kane .
NARRATOR: That same month in Union Square -
INVESTIGATOR: Is it not a fact that on that occasion , the boy personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled ? Loud laughter and confusion .
THATCHER: Mr. Chairman , I will read to this committee a prepared statement I have brought with me - and I will then refuse to answer any furthe questions . Mr. Johnson , please !
SPEAKER: - till the words `` Charles Foste Kane '' are a menace to every working man in this land . He is today what he has always been and always will be - A FASCIST !
NARRATOR: And yet another opinion - Kane 's own .
THIRD MAN: Stand by . I 'll tell you if we want to run it again .
THOMPSON'S VOICE: Well ? A short pause .
A VOICE: See what Arthur Ellis wrote about him in the American review ?
THIRD MAN: I read it .
THE VOICE: Listen Kane is dead . He contributed to the journalism of his day - the talent of a mountebank , the morals of a ootlegger , and the manners of a pasha . He and his kind have almost succeeded in transforming a once noble profession into a seven percent security - no longer secure .
ANOTHER VOICE: That 's what Arthur Ellis is writing now . Thirty years ago , when Kane gave him his chance to clean up Detroit and Chicago and St. Louis , Kane was the greatest guy in the world . If you ask me -
RAWLSTON'S VOICE: Just a minute !
RAWLSTON: What were Kane 's last words ? A silence greets this .
SOMEBODY'S VOICE: Motivation -
RAWLSTON: That 's it - motivation . What made Kane what he was ? And , for that matter , what was he ? What we 've just seen are the outlines of a career - what 's behind the career ? What 's the man ? Was he good o ad ? Strong or foolish ? Tragic or silly ? Why did he do all those things ? What was he after ? Maybe he told us on his death bed .
THOMPSON: Yes , and maybe he did n't .
RAWLSTON: Ask the question anyway , Thompson ! Build the picture around the question , even if you ca n't answe it .
THOMPSON: I know , but -
RAWLSTON: All we saw on that screen was a ig American -
A VOICE: One of the biggest .
RAWLSTON: But how is he different from Ford ? Or Hearst for that matter ? O Rockefeller - or John Doe ?
A VOICE: I know people worked for Kane will tell you - not only in the newspape usiness - look how he raised salaries . You do n't want to forget -
ANOTHER VOICE: You take his labor record alone , they ought to hang him up like a dog .
RAWLSTON: I tell you , Thompson - a man 's dying words -
SOMEBODY'S VOICE: What were they ? Silence .
RAWLSTON: Rosebud !
A VOICE: Tough guy , huh ? Dies calling for Rosebud !
RAWLSTON: Here 's a man who might have been President . He 's been loved and hated and talked about as much as any man in our time - but when he comes to die , he 's got something on his mind called `` Rosebud . '' What does that mean ?
ANOTHER VOICE: A racehorse he bet on once , probably , that did n't come in - Rosebud !
RAWLSTON: All right . But what was the race ? There is a short silence .
THOMPSON: Yes , sir .
RAWLSTON: Hold this thing up for a week . Two weeks if you have to
THOMPSON: But do n't you think if we release it now - he 's only been dead fou days it might be better than if -
RAWLSTON: Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick . Go after the people that knew Kane well . That manager of his - the little guy , Bernstein , those two wives , all the people who knew him , had worked for him , who loved him , who hated his guts - I do n't mean go through the City Directory , of course - The Third Man gives a hearty `` yes-man '' laugh .
THOMPSON: I 'll get to it right away , Mr. Rawlston .
RAWLSTON: Good !
RAWLSTON'S VOICE: It 'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing
THE CAPTAIN: This is Mr. Thompson , Miss Alexander .
SUSAN: I want another drink , John . Low thunder from outside .
THE CAPTAIN: Right away . Will you have something , Mr. Thompson ?
THOMPSON: I 'll have a highball .
SUSAN: Who told you you could sit down here ?
THOMPSON: Oh ! I thought maybe we could have a drink together ?
SUSAN: Think again !
THOMPSON: If you 'd just let me talk to you for a little while , Miss Alexander . All I want to ask you
SUSAN: Get out of here ! Get out ! Get out !
THOMPSON: I 'm sorry . Maybe some other time -
THE CAPTAIN: She 's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers , Mr. Thompson .
THOMPSON: I 'm not from a newspaper exactly ,
THE CAPTAIN: Get her another highball .
THE WAITER: Another double ?
THE CAPTAIN: Yes . They walk to the door .
THOMPSON: She 's plastered , is n't she ?
THE CAPTAIN: She 'll snap out of it . Why , until he died , she 'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody . Sooner .
THOMPSON: I 'll come down in a week or so and see her again . Say , you might be able to help me . When she used to talk about Kane - did she eve happen to say anything - about Rosebud ?
THE CAPTAIN: Rosebud ?
BERTHA: Yes . I 'll take him in now . The directors of the Thatche Library have asked me to remind you again of the condition unde which you may inspect certain portions of Mr. Thatcher 's unpublished memoirs . Under no circumstances are direct quotations from his manuscript to be used by you .
THOMPSON: That 's all right .
BERTHA: You may come with me .
GUARD: Yes , Miss Anderson .
BERTHA: You will confine yourself , it is our understanding , to the chapte dealing with Mr. Kane .
THOMPSON: That 's all I 'm interested in .
BERTHA: You will be required to leave this oom at four-thirty promptly .
MRS. KANE: Be careful , Charles !
THATCHER'S VOICE: Mrs. Kane -
MRS. KANE: Pull your muffler around your neck , Charles -
THATCHER'S VOICE: think we 'll have to tell him now -
MRS. KANE: I 'll sign those papers -
THATCHER: Mr. Kane , the certificates that Mr. Graves left here are made out to Mrs. Kane , in her name . Hers to do with as she pleases -
MRS. KANE: I want you to stop all this nonsense , Jim .
THATCHER: The Bank 's decision in all matters concerning his education , his place of residence and similar subjects will be final .
MRS. KANE: I want you to stop all this nonsense , Jim .
THATCHER: We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you , Mrs. Kane , are the sole owner .
MRS. KANE: Where do I sign , Mr. Thatcher ?
THATCHER: Right here , Mrs. Kane .
MRS. KANE: It is . Go on , Mr. Thatcher -
KANE: If the rebels want a fight boys , let 's give it to 'em !
THATCHER: Everything else - the principal as well as all monies earned - is to e administered by the bank in trust for your son , Charles Foste Kane , until his twenty-fifth irthday , at which time he is to come into complete possession . Mrs. Kane rises and goes to the window .
MRS. KANE: Go on , Mr. Thatcher .
KANE: You ca n't lick Andy Jackson ! Old Hickory , that 's me !
THATCHER'S VOICE: It 's nearly five , Mrs. Kane , do n't you think I 'd better meet the boy -
MRS. KANE: I 've got his trunk all packed - I 've it packed for a couple of weeks -
THATCHER: I 've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago . I 'd have brought him along with me , but you were so anxious to keep everything secret -
KANE: H'ya , Mom . Mrs. Kane smiles .
MRS. KANE: You better come inside , son . You and I have got to get you all ready for - for -
THATCHER: Charles , my name is Mr. Thatcher -
MRS. KANE: This is Mr. Thatcher , Charles .
THATCHER: How do you do , Charles ?
KANE: Hello . Hello , Pop .
MRS. KANE: Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight , Charles . You 'll be leaving on Number Ten .
KANE: You goin ' , Mom ?
THATCHER: Your mother wo n't be going right away , Charles -
KANE: Where 'm I going ?
THATCHER: He certainly is . I wish I were a little boy and going to make a trip like that for the first time .
KANE: Why are n't you comin ' with us , Mom ?
MRS. KANE: We have to stay here , Charles .
THATCHER: We 're going to have a lot of good times together , Charles Really we are . Kane stares at him .
MRS. KANE: Charles !
KANE: Mom ! Mom !
MRS. KANE: It 's all right , Charles , it 's all ight .
KANE: Mom ! Mom !
THATCHER: Is that really your idea of how to un a newspaper ?
KANE: I do n't know how to run a newspaper , Mr. Thatcher . I just try everything I can think of .
THATCHER: `` Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast . '' You know you have n't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast .
KANE: Can you prove it is n't ?
BERNSTEIN: How are you , Mr. Thatcher ?
THATCHER: How do you do ? -
BERNSTEIN: We just had a wire from Cuba , Mr. Kane -
KANE: That 's all right . We have no secrets from our readers . Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted eaders , Mr. Bernstein . He knows what 's wrong with every issue since I 've taken charge . What 's the cable ?
BERNSTEIN: The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but do n't feel right in spending your money for this stop there 's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler .
THATCHER: You see ! There has n't been a true word -
KANE: I think we 'll have to send ou friend Wheeler a cable , Mr. Bernstein . Of course , we 'll have to make it shorter than his , because he 's working on an expense account and we 're not . Let me see - Mike !
MIKE: Go ahead , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Dear Wheeler - You provide the prose poems - I 'll provide the war .
BERNSTEIN: That 's fine , Mr. Kane .
KANE: I rather like it myself . Send it ight away .
MIKE: Right away .
BERNSTEIN: Right away .
THATCHER: I came to see you , Charles , about your - about the Enquirer 's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfe Company .
KANE: Wo n't you step into my office , Mr. Thatcher ? They cross the City Room together .
THATCHER: I think I should remind you , Charles , of a fact you seem to have forgotten . You are yourself one of the largest individual stockholders .
KANE: Mr. Thatcher , is n't everything I 've been saying in the Enquire about the traction trust absolutely true ?
THATCHER: They 're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who 's got more than ten cents in his pocket . They 're -
KANE: The trouble is , Mr. Thatcher , you do n't realize you 're talking to two people .
THATCHER: Charles , my time is too valuable for me -
KANE: On the other hand - I am the publisher of the Enquirer . As such , it is my duty - I 'll let you in on a little secret , it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent , hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind y a group of money - mad pirates ecause , God help them , they have no one to look after thei interests ! I 'll let you in on another little secret , Mr. Thatcher . I think I 'm the man to do it . You see , I have money and property - Thatcher does n't understand him .
THATCHER: I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday , Charles . Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise - this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year ?
KANE: You 're right . We did lose a million dollars last year .
MISS ANDERSON: You have enjoyed a very rare privilege , young man . Did you find what you were looking for ?
THOMPSON: No . Tell me something , Miss Anderson . You 're not Rosebud , are you ?
MISS ANDERSON: What ?
THOMPSON: I did n't think you were . Well , thanks for the use of the hall .
BERNSTEIN: Who 's a busy man ? Me ? I 'm Chairman of the Board . I got nothing but time What do you want to know ?
THOMPSON: Well , Mr. Bernstein , you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
BERNSTEIN: From before the beginning , young fellow . And now it 's after the end . Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
THOMPSON: - We thought maybe , if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
BERNSTEIN: That Rosebud ? Maybe some girl ? There were a lot of them back in the early days , and -
THOMPSON: Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years , on his death bed -
BERNSTEIN: You 're pretty young , Mr. - Mr. Thompson . A fellow will emember things you would n't think he 'd remember . You take me . One day , back in 1896 , I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out , there was anothe ferry pulling in - - and on it , there was a girl waiting to get off . A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she did n't see me at all - but I 'll bet a month has n't gone by since that I have n't thought of that girl . See what I mean ? Well , so what are you doing about this `` Rosebud , '' Mr. Thompson .
THOMPSON: I 'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane . I 'm calling on you .
BERNSTEIN: Who else you been to see ?
THOMPSON: Well , I went down to Atlantic City -
BERNSTEIN: Susie ? I called her myself the day after he died . I thought maybe somebody ought to She could n't even come to the 'phone .
THOMPSON: You know why ? She was so -
BERNSTEIN: Sure , sure .
THOMPSON: I 'm going back there .
BERNSTEIN: Who else did you see ?
THOMPSON: Nobody else , but I 've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher 's . That journal of his -
BERNSTEIN: Thatcher ! That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
THOMPSON: He made an awful lot of money .
BERNSTEIN: It 's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money . Thatcher !
CITY EDITOR: What about Branford Leland ? Has he got in his copy ?
HIRELING: Not yet .
BERNSTEIN: Go in and ask him to hurry .
CITY EDITOR: Well , why do n't you , Mr. Bernstein ? You know Mr. Leland .
BERNSTEIN: I might make him nervous .
CITY EDITOR: You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days , I understand .
BERNSTEIN: That 's right . They called us the `` Three Musketeers . ''
CITY EDITOR: He 's a great guy - Leland . Why 'd he ever leave New York ?
BERNSTEIN: That 's a long story .
ANOTHER HIRELING: Was n't there some sort of quarrel etween -
BERNSTEIN: I had nothing to do with it . It was Leland and Mr. Kane , and you could n't call it a quarrel exactly . Better we should forget such things - Leland is writing it up from the dramatic angle ?
CITY EDITOR: Yes . I thought it was a good idea . We 've covered it from the news end , of course .
BERNSTEIN: And the social . How about the music notice ? You got that in ?
CITY EDITOR: Oh , yes , it 's already made up . Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review .
BERNSTEIN: Enthusiastic ?
CITY EDITOR: Yes , very ! Naturally .
BERNSTEIN: Well , well - is n't that nice ?
KANE'S VOICE: Mr. Bernstein - Bernstein turns .
BERNSTEIN: Hello , Mr. Kane .
CITY EDITOR: Mr. Kane , this is a surprise !
KANE: We 've got a nice plant here .
CITY EDITOR: Exactly according to you instructions , Mr. Kane . We 've got two spreads of pictures .
KANE: And the notice ?
CITY EDITOR: Yes - Mr. Kane .
KANE: Is it good ?
CITY EDITOR: Yes , Mr. kane . Kane looks at him for a minute .
KANE: It is n't finished ?
CITY EDITOR: No , Mr. Kane .
KANE: That 's Leland , is n't it ?
CITY EDITOR: Yes , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Has he said when he 'll finish ?
CITY EDITOR: We have n't heard from him .
KANE: He used to work fast - did n't he , Mr. Bernstein ?
BERNSTEIN: He sure did , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Where is he ?
ANOTHER HIRELING: Right in there , Mr. Kane .
KANE: That 's all right , Mr. Bernstein .
BERNSTEIN: Leland and Mr. Kane - they have n't spoke together for ten years . Excuse me .
KANE: What does it say there ? Bernstein stares at him .
BERNSTEIN: `` Miss Susan Alexander , a pretty ut hopelessly incompetent amateur - - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of - '' I ca n't pronounce that name , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Thais .
BERNSTEIN: `` Her singing , happily , is no concern of this department . Of her acting , it is absolutely impossible to ''
KANE: Go on !
BERNSTEIN: That 's all there is .
KANE: Of her acting , it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low Have you got that , Mr. Bernstein ? In the opinion of this reviewer -
BERNSTEIN: I did n't see that .
KANE: It is n't here , Mr. Bernstein . I 'm dictating it .
BERNSTEIN: I ca n't take shorthand .
KANE: Get me a typewriter . I 'll finish the notice . Bernstein retreats from the room .
BERNSTEIN: He finished it . He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved . We ran it in every paper .
THOMPSON: I guess Mr. Kane did n't think so well of Susie 's art anyway .
BERNSTEIN: He thought she was great , Mr. Thompson . He really believed that . He put all his ambition on that girl . After she came along , he never really cared for himself like he used to . Oh , I do n't lame Susie -
THOMPSON: Well , then , how could he write that roast ? The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her .
BERNSTEIN: Oh , yes . He saw to that . I tell you , Mr. Thompson , he was a hard man to figure out . He had that funny sense of humor . And then , too , maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man . You see , Leland did n't think so . I guess he showed him all right . He 's a nice fellow , ut he 's a dreamer . They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer . On these last words , we
CARTER: Welcome , Mr. Kane , to the `` Enquirer . '' I am Herbert Carter .
KANE: Thank you , Mr Carter . This is Mr. Leland .
CARTER: How do you do , Mr. Leland ?
KANE: Are they standing for me ?
CARTER: I thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher -
KANE: Ask them to sit down .
CARTER: You may resume your work , gentlemen . I did n't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations .
KANE: I do n't my plans myself .
CARTER: How do you do , Mr. Bernstein ?
KANE: You 've got a private office here , have n't you ?
CARTER: My little sanctum is at you disposal . But I do n't think I understand -
KANE: I 'm going to live right here . As long as I have to .
CARTER: But a morning newspaper , Mr. Kane . After all , we 're practically closed twelve hours a day - except fo the business offices -
KANE: That 's one of the things I think must be changed , Mr. Carter . The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day .
CARTER: Because we 're running a newspaper , Mr. Kane , not a scandal sheet .
KANE: I 'm still hungry , Brad . Let 's go to Rector 's and get something decent . The `` Chronicle '' has a two-column headline , Mr. Carter . Why have n't we ?
CARTER: There is no news big enough .
KANE: If the headline is big enough , it makes the new big enough . The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
CARTER: As a matter of fact , we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon . Our man even arrived before the `` Chronicle '' reporter . And there 's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she 's dead .
KANE: The `` Chronicle '' does n't say she 's murdered , Mr. Carter . It says the neighbors are getting suspicious .
CARTER: It 's not our function to report the gossip of housewives . If we were interested in that kind of thing , Mr. Kane , we could fill the paper twice over daily -
KANE: That 's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on , Mr. Carter . Right now , I wish you 'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone . Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he does n't produce his wife at once , the `` Enquirer '' will have him arrested . Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he 's a detective from the Central Office . If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his adge , your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist . Loudly , so that the neighbors can hear .
CARTER: Really , Mr. Kane , I ca n't see the function of a respectable newspaper - Kane is n't listening to him .
KANE: Oh , Mr. Bernstein ! Bernstein looks up from his figures .
BERNSTEIN: I ordered six already this morning ! Got a discount !
CARTER: But , Mr. Kane -
KANE: That 'll be all today , Mr. Carter . You 've been most understanding . Good day , Mr. Carter !
LELAND: Poor Mr. Carter !
KANE: What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid , something inflexible , that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
BERNSTEIN: Three cents .
KANE: Two cents .
BERNSTEIN: This is all figured at three cents a copy .
KANE: Re-figure it , Mr. Bernstein , at two cents .
BERNSTEIN: All right , but I 'll keep these figures , too , just in case .
KANE: Ready for dinner , Brad ?
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Leland , if Mr. Kane , he should decide to drop the price to one cent , or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you 'll just hold him until I get back , wo n't you ?
LELAND: I 'm not guaranteeing a thing , Mr. Bernstein . You people work too fast for me ! Talk about new brooms !
BERNSTEIN: Who said anything about brooms ?
KANE: It 's a saying , Mr. Bernstein . A new broom sweeps clean .
BERNSTEIN: Oh !
SMATHERS: But it 's impossible , Mr. Kane . We ca n't remake these pages .
KANE: These pages are n't made up as I want them , Mr. Smathers . We go to press in five minutes .
CARTER: The `` Enquirer '' has an old and honored tradition , Mr. Kane The `` Enquirer '' is not in competition with those other rags .
BERNSTEIN: We should be publishing such rags , that 's all I wish . Why , the `` Enquirer '' - I would n't wrap up the liver for the cat in the `` Enquirer '' -
CARTER: Mr. Kane , I must ask you to see to it that this - this person learns to control his tongue . Kane looks up .
KANE: It is accepted , Mr. Carter , with assurances of my deepest regard .
CARTER: But Mr. Kane , I meant -
KANE: Let 's remake these pages , Mr. Smathers . We 'll have to publish a half hour late , that 's all .
SMATHERS: We ca n't remake them , Mr. Kane . We go to press in five minutes .
KANE: You can remake them now , ca n't you , Mr. Smathers ?
BERNSTEIN: In case you do n't understand , Mr. Smathers - he 's a new broom .
LELAND: We 'll be on the street soon , Charlie - another ten minutes .
BERNSTEIN: It 's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
KANE: Tired ?
LELAND: It 's been a tough day .
KANE: A wasted day .
BERNSTEIN: Wasted ?
LELAND: Charlie ? !
BERNSTEIN: You just made the paper over fou times today , Mr. Kane . That 's all -
KANE: I 've changed the front page a little , Mr. Bernstein . That 's not enough - There 's something I 've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - I 've got to make the `` New York Enquirer '' as important to New York as the gas in that light .
LELAND: What 're you going to do , Charlie ?
KANE: My Declaration of Principles - Do n't smile , Brad - Take dictation , Mr. Bernstein -
BERNSTEIN: Ca n't take shorthand , Mr. Kane -
KANE: I 'll write it myself .
BERNSTEIN: You do n't wanta make any promises , Mr. Kane , you do n't wanta keep .
KANE: These 'll be kept . I 'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly . will also provide them -
LELAND: That 's the second sentence you 've started with `` I '' -
KANE: People are going to know who 's esponsible . And they 're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly . And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news .
BERNSTEIN: Sixty-two thousand -
LELAND: That looks pretty nice .
KANE: Let 's hope they like it there .
BERNSTEIN: From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let 's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough .
KANE: Look at that .
LELAND: The `` Chronicle '' is a good newspaper .
KANE: It 's a good idea for a newspaper . Four hundred sixy thousand .
BERNSTEIN: Say , with them fellows - - it 's no trick to get circulation .
KANE: You 're right , Mr. Bernstein .
BERNSTEIN: You know how long it took the `` Chronicle '' to get that staff together ? Twenty years .
KANE: I know .
PHOTOGRAPHER: That 's all . Thank you . The photographic subjects rise .
KANE: Make up an extra copy and mail it to the `` Chronicle . ''
BERNSTEIN: Two hundred and one thousand , six hundred and forty-seven . General applause .
KANE: All of you - new and old - You 're all getting the best salaries in town . Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty . It 's your talent I 'm interested in . That talent that 's going to make the `` Enquirer '' the kind of paper I want - the best newspape in the world ! Applause .
THE OFFICIAL: There you are , Mr. Kane . Everything in order .
KANE: Thank you .
THE OFFICIAL: Have a good rest , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Thanks .
BERNSTEIN: But please , Mr. Kane , do n't buy any more paintings . Nine Venuses already we got , twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
KANE: I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
STEWARD'S VOICE: All ashore !
KANE: - and to forget about the new feature sections - and not to try to think up and ideas for comic sections .
STEWARD'S VOICE: All ashore that 's going ashore !
KANE: Goodbye , gents ! Hey !
BERNSTEIN: Do you , Mr. Leland ?
LELAND: Certainly not . They start down the gangplank together .
KANE: Ask them to sit down , Mr. Bernstein .
BERNSTEIN: Sit down , everybody - for heaven 's sake !
KANE: We certainly do . Vacation 's over - starting right after dinner . But ight now - that lady over there - - that 's the new society editor , I take it ? You think I could interrupt her a moment , Mr. Bernstein ?
BERNSTEIN: Huh ? Oh , I forgot - you 've been away so long I forgot about you joking -
MISS TOWNSEND: Good afternoon , Mr. Bernstein .
BERNSTEIN: This is Mr. Kane , Miss Townsend .
KANE: Miss Townsend -
MISS TOWNSEND: Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton announce the engagement of thei daughter , Emily Monroe Norton , to Mr. Charles Foster Kane .
BERNSTEIN: Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton announce -
MISS TOWNSEND: She 's - she 's the niece of - of the President of the United States -
BERNSTEIN: know . Come on , Miss Townsend - From the window , maybe we can get a look . He takes her by the hand and leads her off .
THOMPSON: It did n't end very well , did it ?
BERNSTEIN: It ended - Then there was Susie - that ended , too . guess he did n't make her very happy -
A PAUSE: You know , I was thinking - that Rosebud you 're trying to find out about -
THOMPSON: Yes -
BERNSTEIN: Maybe that was something he lost . Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - You ought to talk to Bradford Leland . He could tell you a lot . I wish I could tell you where Leland is , but I do n't know myself . He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead .
THOMPSON: In case you 'd like to know , Mr. Bernstein , he 's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street .
BERNSTEIN: You do n't say ! Why I had no idea -
THOMPSON: Nothing particular the matter with him , they tell me . Just -
BERNSTEIN: Just old age . It 's the only disease , Mr. Thompson , you do n't look forward to being cured of . You ought to see Mr. Leland . There 's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to .
LELAND'S VOICE: When you get to my age , young man , you do n't miss anything . Unless maybe it 's a good drink of bourbon . Even that does n't make much difference , if you remember there has n't been any good bourbon in this country for twenty years .
THOMPSON: Mr. Leland , you were -
LELAND: You do n't happen to have a cigar , do you ? I 've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he has n't got one - who thinks I 'm going to stop smoking I changed the subject , did n't I ? Dear , dear ! What a disagreeable old man I 've become . You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane ? Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness . But he kept it to himself . He never - gave himself away - He never gave anything away . He just - left you a tip . He had a generous mind . I do n't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions . That was because he had the power to express them , and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - But he did n't believe in anything except Charlie Kane . He never had a conviction in his life . I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant . Of course , a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death . But we do know what we 're leaving we elieve in something . You 're absolutely sure you have n't got a cigar ?
THOMPSON: Sorry , Mr. Leland .
LELAND: Never mind - Bernstein told you about the first days at the office , did n't he ? Well , Charlie was a ad newspaper man even then . He entertained his readers , but he never told them the truth .
THOMPSON: Maybe you could remember something that -
LELAND: I can remember everything . That 's my curse , young man . It 's the greatest curse that 's ever been inflicted on the human race . Memory - I was his oldest friend . As far as I was concerned , he ehaved like swine . Maybe I wasnt ' his friend . If I was n't , he neve had one . Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
KANE'S VOICE: Not one of you has been hired ecause of his loyalty . It 's you talent I 'm interested in . That talent that 's going to make the `` Enquirer '' the kind of paper I want - the best newspaper in the world !
BERNSTEIN: Is n't it wonderful ? Such a party !
LELAND: Yes . His tone causes Bernstein to look at him .
KANE'S VOICE: However , I think you 'll agree we 've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night .
BERNSTEIN: What 's the matter ?
LELAND: Mr. Bernstein , these men who are now with the `` Enquirer '' - who were with the `` Chronicle '' until yesterday - were n't they just as devoted to the `` Chronicle '' kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper ?
BERNSTEIN: Sure . They 're like anybody else . They got work to do . They do it . Only they happen to be the best men in the business .
KANE: There are other subjects in the world -
LELAND: Do we stand for the same things that the `` Chronicle '' stands for , Mr. Bernstein ?
BERNSTEIN: Certainly not . So what 's that got to do with it ? Mr. Kane , he 'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week .
LELAND: Probably . There 's always a chance , of course , that they 'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it .
KANE: Well , gentlemen , are we going to war ?
LELAND: Our readers are , anyway , I do n't know about the rest of the country .
KANE: It 'll be our first foreign war in fifty years , Brad . We 'll cover it the way the `` Hickville Gazette '' covers the church social ! The names of everybody there ; what they wore ; what they ate ; who won the prizes ; who gave the prizes - I tell you , Brad , I envy you . By Bradford Leland , the `` Enquirer 's '' Special Correspondent at the Front . I 'm almost tempted -
LELAND: But there is no Front , Charlie . There 's a very doubtful civil war . Besides , I do n't want the job .
KANE: All right , Brad , all right - you do n't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I 'd want to . Hello , Georgie .
GEORGIE: Is everything the way you want it , dear ?
KANE: If everybody 's having fun , that 's the way I want it .
GEORGIE: I 've got some other little girls coming over -
LELAND: Charles , I tell you there is no war ! There 's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
KANE: How would the `` Enquirer '' look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton , Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it ?
LELAND: They do it only because you do !
KANE: And I do it because they do it , and they do it - it 's a vicious circle , is n't it ? I 'm going over to Georgie 's , Brad - you know , Georgie , do n't you ? Leland nods .
GEORGIE: Glad to meet you , Brad . Leland shudders .
KANE: I told you about Brad , Georgie . He needs to relax . Brad does n't answer .
GEORGIE: Ethel - this gentlemen has been very anxious to meet you - This is Ethel .
ETHEL: Hello , Mr. Leland .
ANOTHER GIRL: Is there a song about Charlie ?
KANE: Say , Brad . I 've got an idea .
LELAND: Yes ?
KANE: I mean I 've got a job for you .
LELAND: Good .
KANE: You do n't want to be a wa correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic ?
LELAND: I 'd like that .
KANE: You start tomorrow night . Richard Carl in `` The Spring Chicken . '' I 'll get us some girls . You get tickets . A drama critic gets them free , you know . Rector 's at seven ?
LELAND: Charlie -
KANE: Yes ?
LELAND: It does n't make any difference about me , but one of these days you 're going to find out that all this charm of yours wo n't be enough -
KANE: You 're wrong . It does make a difference to you - Rector 's , Brad ? Come to think of it , I do n't blame you for not wanting to be a wa correspondent . You wo n't miss anything . It is n't much of a war . Besides , they tell me there is n't a decent restaurant on the whole island .
BERNSTEIN: Do you , Mr. Leland ?
LELAND: Certainly not . Slight pause . They continue on their way .
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Leland , why did n't you go to Europe with him ? He wanted you to . He said to me just yesterday -
LELAND: I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
BERNSTEIN: Do n't I always ? Most of the time ?
LELAND: Mr. Bernstein , am I a stuffed shirt ? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite ? Am I a New England school-marm ?
BERNSTEIN: Yes . Leland is surprised .
LELAND: You 're in a conspiracy against me , you two . You always have been .
BERNSTEIN: Against me there should be such a conspiracy some time !
LELAND: September the ninth ?
THOMPSON: It 's a letter from her lawyers .
LELAND: David , Grobleski & Davis - My dear Rawlston -
THOMPSON: Rawlston is my boss .
LELAND: Oh , yes . I know about Mr. Rawlston .
THOMPSON: He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially - That 's the answer we got .
LELAND: I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday . I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall can not be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane .
THOMPSON: Was he in love ?
LELAND: He married for love - That 's why he did everything . That 's why he went into politics . It seems we were n't enough . He wanted all the voters to love him , too . All he really wanted out of life was love . That 's Charlie 's story - it 's the story of how he lost it . You see , he just did n't have any to give . He loved Charlie Kane , of course , very dearly - and his mother , I guess he always loved her . As for Emily - well , all I can tell you is Emily 's story as she told it to me , which probably is n't fair - there 's supposed to e two sides to every story - and I guess there are . I guess there 's more than two sides -
THE PRESIDENT: It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people . You are not , I hope , suggesting that these interests are not indentical ?
KANE: I 'm not suggesting anything , Mr. President ! I 've come here to tell you that , unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high- pressure crooks !
THE PRESIDENT: I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein , Mr. Kane .
KANE: It 's the only vein I know . I tell the facts the way I see them . And any man that knows that facts -
THE PRESIDENT: I know the facts , Mr. Kane . And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean . You 're a man of great talents , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Thanks .
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that you have political ambitions . Unfortunately , you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
KANE: I 'm much obliged , Mr. President , for your concern about me . However , I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States , and I say that if this lease goes through , the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
THE PRESIDENT: You 've made your point perfectly clear , Mr. Kane . Good day .
KANE: Mr. President . He starts out of the office .
FOREMAN: How about it , Mr. Kane ?
KANE: All right . Let her slide !
REILLY: Looks bad for us , Mr. Kane . How shall we handle it ?
KANE: It 's a news story ! Get it on the street !
KANE: Take dictation - Front page editorial - `` This afternoon a great man was assassinated . He was the President of the United States - ''
LELAND: Charlie -
KANE: Yes ?
LELAND: Do you think you 're the one who should call him a great man ?
KANE: Why not ?
LELAND: Why not ? Well - nobody 's a great man in your estimation until he 's dead .
REILLY: Maybe we 'd better wait for more word on the President 's condition .
KANE: What do you mean by that ?
LELAND: Competition .
REILLY: He may recover -
KANE: What do you mean by that ?
LELAND: Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor . What do you think that crowd is doing down there ? They think you murdered him .
KANE: Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the `` Enquirer '' in his pocket ?
LELAND: - and that copy of the `` Enquirer '' said the President should be killed .
KANE: I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
LELAND: You 've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months .
KANE: They 're true ! Everything I said ! Witholding that veto was treason !
LELAND: Charlie !
KANE: Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - Nobody can blame me ecause -
LELAND: Look out that window . Kane stops - looks at him .
KANE: What lesson ? Not to expose fraud when I see it ? Not to fight fo the right of the people to own their own property ? Run it the way I said , Reilly - `` This afternoon a great man was assassinated - ''
LELAND: Charlie ! Now you 're not making sense .
KANE: I do n't have to . I run a newspape with half a million readers and they 're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast . I ca n't help that . Besides , they all know I 'm married to his niece . I 've got to think of her .
LELAND: What ?
KANE: I 've got to think of Emily -
LELAND: I 'd like to talk to you about that .
KANE: Go ahead .
LELAND: Finish your editorial .
BERNSTEIN: I 'm all right , Mr. Leland . Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me . I learned 'em ! Did n't I , officer ?
THE COP: You sure did - Say , the Commissioner said I was to stand y and protect Mr. Kane until further orders , no matter how he felt about it . Where is he ?
LELAND: In there .
BERNSTEIN: If you had n't come along and protected me when you did , I 'd have killed them fellows .
LELAND: Go and get yourself washed up , Mr. Bernstein . There does n't seem to be an serious injury .
BERNSTEIN: Not to me . But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane , wo n't you ?
LELAND: Yes , Mr. Bernstein .
REILLY: Goodnight , Mr. Kane .
LELAND: First of all -
KANE: What 's wrong , Brad ?
LELAND: I 'm drunk .
KANE: I 'll get you some coffee . He rises and goes to the door .
LELAND: First of all , I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the `` Enquirer . ''
KANE: That 's just a little promotion scheme . Nobody expects you - Mike , will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee ?
MIKE'S VOICE: Sure thing , Mr. Kane .
LELAND: Charlie , it 's just no go . We ca n't agree anymore . I wish you 'd let me go to Chicago .
KANE: Why , Brad ?
LELAND: I want to be transferred to the new paper . You 've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - That 's not what I wanted to talk about .
KANE: I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Brad - I 'll get drunk , too - maybe that 'll help .
LELAND: No , that wo n't help . Besides , you never get drunk . I wanted to talk about you and Emily .
KANE: All right .
LELAND: She 's going to leave you -
KANE: I do n't think so , Brad . We 've just had word that the President is out of danger . It seems I did n't kill him afte all .
LELAND: She was going to leave you anyway - Kane takes this in .
KANE: Brad , you are drunk .
LELAND: Sure I am . She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens . If you wo n't agree to that , she 'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President 's wishes . I ca n't tell her she 's wrong , because she is n't wrong -
KANE: Why is she leaving me ?
LELAND: She has n't any friends left sine you started this oil business , and she never sees you .
KANE: Do you think the `` Enquirer '' should n't have campaigned against the oil leases ?
LELAND: You might have made the whole thing less personal ! No answer from Kane .
KANE: The personal note is all there is to it . It 's all there ever is to it . It 's all there every is to anything ! Stupidity in ou government , complacency and self- satisfaction and unwillingness to elieve that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you ca n't fight those things impersonally . They 're not impersonal crimes against people . They 're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue , Brad , that you debate - and then the judges etire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers .
LELAND: You almost convince me . I 'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth . I have to be a little drunk for that because I 'm a coward . You know that . That 's why you keep me around . You only associate with you inferiors , Charlie . I guess that 's why you ran away from Emily . Because you ca n't stand the company of your equals . You do n't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead . I told you that .
KANE: Are you finished ?
LELAND: Yes . Now , will you let me go to Chicago ?
KANE: You 're not going to like it in Chicago . They wind comes howling in from the lake . And there 's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whethe they 've ever heard of Lobste Newburg -
LELAND: That 's all right . What are you going to do about Emily ?
KANE: Nothing - if she dose n't love me -
LELAND: You want love on your own terms , do n't you , Charlie - Love according to your own rules . And if anything goes wrong and you 're hurt - then the game stops , and you 've got to be soothed and nursed , no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt !
KANE: It 's simpler than that , Brad . A society girl ca n't stand the gaff , that 's all . Other things are important to her - social position , what they 're saying on the front porches at Southampton , is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
LELAND: I know you will .
KANE: Hey , Brad ! I 've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let 's have another brandy .
LELAND: No . I wish you 'd go home to Emily . She 'll be pretty upset by all this - She still loves you -
KANE: You still want to be transferred to the other paper ?
LELAND: Yes .
KANE: Well , you 've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York . It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he 's worth .
LELAND: I could n't possibly live on as little as that , Charlie . We 'll let the salary stay where it is .
KANE: Excuse us a moment , please . The nurse looks at Emily .
EMILY: Charles . He waits for her to continue .
KANE: They wo n't do anything to Junior , darling . Anonymous letter writers - I 've got guards in front of the house , and I 'm going to arrange -
EMILY: Please do n't talk any more , Charles .
KANE: I 've tried to tell you , Emily . The President 's going to be all ight . He had a comfortable night . There 's no danger of any kind .
EMILY: Here I am , darling Darling ! Darling , it 's all right Mother 's here .
KANE: Emily - you mus n't leave me now - you ca n't do that to me .
EMILY: They wo n't hurt you , darling . Mother 's with you ! Mother 's looking after you !
KANE: We 'll withdraw support completely . Anything else ?
REILLY: Mr. Leland sent back that check .
KANE: What check ?
REILLY: You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago .
KANE: Oh , yes , the bonus .
REILLY: It was for twenty-five thousand dollars .
KANE: It is no secret that I entered upon this campaign with no thought that I could be elected Governo of this state ! It is now no secret that every straw vote , every independent pole , shows that I will be elected . And I repeat to you - my first official act as Governor will be to appoint a special District Attorney to arrange for the indictment , prosecution and conviction of Boss Edward G. Rogers !
SECOND LEADER: One of the most notable public utterances ever made by a candidate in this state -
KANE: Thank you , gentlemen . Thank you .
REILLY: A wonderful speech , Mr. Kane .
KANE: It does seem too good to be true , does n't it , Mr. Bernstein ?
REILLY: Rogers is n't even pretending . He is n't just scared anymore . He 's sick . Frank Norris told me last night he has n't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years .
KANE: I think it 's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say . With Mr. Rogers out of the way , Reilly , I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state . Well , Mr. Bernstein ?
BERNSTEIN: It 's wonderful , Mr. Kane . Wonderful . Wonderful .
KANE: You do n't really think so ?
BERNSTEIN: I do . I do . I mean , since you 're unning for Governor - and you want to be elected - I think it 's wonderful you 're going to be elected . Only - - Can I say something ?
KANE: Please , Mr. Bernstein .
BERNSTEIN: Well , the way I look at it - - You want to know what I really think would be wonderful ? Kane indicates he is to proceed .
JUNIOR: Is Pop Governor yet , Mom ?
KANE: Hello , Butch ! Did you like you old man 's speech ?
JUNIOR: Hello , Pop ! I was in a box . I could hear every word .
KANE: I saw you ! Good night , gentlemen .
EMILY: I 'm sending Junior home in the car , Charles - with Oliver -
KANE: But I 'd arranged to go home with you myself .
EMILY: There 's a call I want you to make with me , Charles .
KANE: It can wait .
EMILY: No , it ca n't . Good night , darling .
JUNIOR: Good night , Mom .
KANE: What 's this all about , Emily ? I 've had a very tiring day and -
EMILY: It may not be about anything at all . A cab has pulled up .
THE DRIVER: Cab ? Emily nods to him .
EMILY: I intend to find out .
KANE: I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind .
EMILY: I 'm going to - - 185 West 74th Street .
KANE: I 'll go with you .
THE MAID: Come in , Mr. Kane , come in . They enter , Emily first .
SUSAN: It was n't my fault , Charlie . He made me send your wife a note . He said I 'd - oh , he 's been saying the most terrible things , I did n't know what to do I -
ROGERS: Good evening , Mr. Kane . I do n't suppose anybody would introduce us . Mrs. Kane , I am Edward Rogers .
EMILY: How do you do ? I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me ecause I recieved this note -
ROGERS: I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note . She was a little unwilling at first - ut she did it .
SUSAN: I ca n't tell you the things he said , Charlie . You have n't got any idea -
KANE: Rogers , I do n't think I will postpone doing something about you until I 'm elected . To start with , I 'll break you neck .
ROGERS: Maybe you can do it and maybe you ca n't , Mr. Kane .
EMILY: Charles ! Your - your breaking this man 's neck - would scarcely explain this note - Serious consequences for Mr. Kane - for myself , and for my son . What does this note mean , Miss -
SUSAN: I 'm Susan Alexander . I know what you think , Mrs. Kane , ut -
EMILY: What does this note mean , Miss Alexander ?
ROGERS: She does n't know , Mrs. Kane . She just sent it - because I made he see it would n't be smart for he not to send it .
KANE: In case you do n't know , Emily , this - this gentleman - is -
ROGERS: I 'm not a gentleman , Mrs. Kane , and your husband is just trying to e funny calling me one . I do n't even know what a gentleman is . You see , my idea of a gentleman , Mrs. Kane - well , if I owned a newspaper and if I did n't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican , say - I 'd fight them with everything I had . Only I would n't show him in a convict suit , with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper . Or his mother . It 's pretty clear - I 'm not a gentleman .
EMILY: Oh ! !
KANE: You 're a cheap , crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
ROGERS: Anything you say , Mr. Kane . Only we 're talking now about what you are . That 's what the note is about , Mrs. Kane . Now I 'm going to lay all my cards on the table . I 'm fighting for my life . Not just my political life . My life . If you husband is elected governor -
KANE: I 'm going to be elected governor . And the first thing I 'm going to do -
EMILY: Let him finish , Charles .
ROGERS: I 'm protecting myself every way I know how , Mrs. Kane . This last week , I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected . If the people of this state learn what I found out this week , he would n't have a chance to - he could n't be elected Dog Catcher . Well , what I 'm interested in is seeing that he 's not elected . I do n't care whether they know what I know about him . Let him keep ight on being the Great , Noble , Moral - Champeen of the people . Just as long as -
EMILY: I think I understand , Mr. Rogers , ut wonder if -
KANE: You ca n't blackmail me , Rogers , you ca n't -
SUSAN: Charlie , he said , unless you withdrew your name -
ROGERS: That 's the chance I 'm willing to give you , Mr. Kane . More of a chance than you 'd give me . Unless you make up your mind by tomorrow that you 're so sick that you 've got to go away for a year or two - Monday morning every paper in this State will carry the story I 'm going to give them . Kane starts to stare at him intently .
EMILY: What story , Mr. Rogers ?
ROGERS: The story about him and Miss Alexander , Mrs. Kane . Emily looks at Kane .
SUSAN: There is no story . It 's all lies . Mr. Kane is just -
ROGERS: Shut up ! I 've had a dozen men doing nothing ut run this thing down - we 've got evidence enough to - well , the evidence would stand up in any court of law . You want me to give you the evidence , Mr. Kane ?
KANE: You do anything you want to do . The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust . If you want to know , they 've already decided . The election Tuesday 'll e only -
ROGERS: Mrs. Kane , I 'm not asking you to elieve me . I 'd like to show you -
EMILY: You do n't have to show me anything , Mr. Rogers . I believe you .
ROGERS: I 'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published . Not that I care about him . But I 'd be better off that way - - and so would you , Mrs. Kane .
SUSAN: What about me ? He said my name 'd be dragged through the mud . He said everywhere I 'd go from now on -
EMILY: There seems to be only one decision you can make , Charles . I 'd say that it has been made for you . I suppose the details can be arranged tomorrow , Mr. Rogers . About the statements by the doctors -
KANE: Have you gone completely mad , Emily ? Emily looks at him .
EMILY: I do n't see what else you can do , Charles . If he 's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
KANE: Oh , they 'll publish it all right . But that 's not going to stop me -
EMILY: Charles , this - this story - does n't concern only you . I 'll be in it , too , wo n't I ? And Junior ?
KANE: I suppose so , but - I 'm not afraid of the story . You ca n't tell me that the voters of this state -
EMILY: I 'm not interested in the voters of this state right now . I am interested in - well , Junior , fo one thing .
SUSAN: Charlie ! If they publish this story -
EMILY: They wo n't . Goodnight , Mr. Rogers . There 's nothing more to be said , Charles .
KANE: Oh yes , there is .
EMILY: I do n't think so . Are you coming , Charles ?
KANE: No .
EMILY: You decided what you were going to do , Charles - some time ago . You ca n't always have it your own way , regardless of anything else that may have happened . Come on , Charles .
KANE: Go on ! Get out ! I can fight this thing all alone !
ROGERS: You 're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would , Mr. Kane . You 're licked . Why do n't you -
KANE: Get out ! I 've got nothing to talk to you about . If you want to see me , have the Warden write me a letter .
ROGERS: I see !
SUSAN: Charlie , you 're just excited . You do n't realize -
KANE: I know exactly what I 'm doing . Get out !
EMILY: Charles , if you do n't listen to eason , it may be too late -
KANE: Too late for what ? Too late fo you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me ? Well , you wo n't do it , I tell you . You wo n't do it !
SUSAN: Charlie , there are other things to think of . Your son - you do n't want him to ead in the papers -
EMILY: It is too late now , Charles .
KANE: Get out , both of you !
SUSAN: Charlie , please do n't -
KANE: What are you waiting here for ? Why do n't you go ?
EMILY: Goodnight , Charles .
ROGERS: You 're the greatest fool I 've eve known , Kane . If it was anybody else , I 'd say what 's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you . Only you 're going to need more than one lesson . And you 're going to get more than one lesson .
KANE: Do n't you worry about me . I 'm Charles Foster Kane . I 'm no cheap , crooked politician , trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
EMILY: Hello , Brad -
LELAND: Emily -
EMILY: I 'm sorry I sent for you , Brad - did n't -
LELAND: Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours - She does n't have anything to say .
EMILY: Are all the returns in ?
LELAND: Almost two to one -
EMILY: I 'm surprised he got the votes he did .
LELAND: Emily !
EMILY: Why should anyone vote for him ? He 's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them . Children - to be told one thing one day , something else the next , as the whim seizes him . And they 're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars .
LELAND: Emily , you 're being - a little unfair - You know what I think of Charles ' behavior - about you personal lives -
EMILY: There are n't any personal lives for people like us . He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I 'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life , I 'd have left him then -
LELAND: know that , Emily -
EMILY: Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was .
LELAND: Emily , you -
EMILY: Brad , I 'm - I 'm not an old woman yet -
LELAND: It 's - all over - He stops himself .
EMILY: Know it is , Brad -
LELAND: He 's paying for it , Emily . Those eturns tonight - he 's finished . Politically - - socially , everywhere , I guess . do n't know about the papers , but -
EMILY: If you 're asking me to sympathize with him , Brad , you 're wasting your time . There 's only one person I 'm sorry for , as a matter of fact . That - that shabby little girl . I 'm really sorry for her , Brad .
BERNSTEIN: Hello , Mr. Leland .
LELAND: Hello , Bernstein .
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Kane is finishing it .
LELAND: Kane ? Charlie ? Where is he ?
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it . Leland turns incredulously to Bernstein .
KANE: Hello , Brad .
LELAND: Hello , Charlie -
ANOTHER PAUSE: I did n't know we were speaking . Kane stops typing , but does n't turn .
KANE: Sure , we 're speaking , Brad - you 're fired .
LELAND: Well , that 's about all there is - and I 'm getting chills . Hey , nurse ! Five years ago , he wrote from that place of his down South - - you know . Shangri-la ? El Dorado ? Sloppy Joe 's ? What 's the name of that place ? You know All right . Xanadu . I knew what it was all the time . You caught on , did n't you ?
THOMPSON: Yes .
LELAND: I guess maybe I 'm not as hard to see through as I think . Anyway , I never even answered his letter . Maybe I should have . I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years . He had n't finished it when she left him - he neve finished it - he never finished anything . Of course , he built it for her -
THOMPSON: That must have been love .
LELAND: I do n't know . He was disappointed in the world . So he built one of his own - An absolute monarchy - It was something bigger than an opera house anyway - Nurse ! Say , I 'll tell you one thing you can do for me , young fellow .
THOMPSON: Sure .
LELAND: On your way out , stop at a ciga store , will you , and send me up a couple of cigars ?
THOMPSON: Sure , Mr. Leland . I 'll be glad to .
LELAND: Hey , Nurse ! A Nurse appears .
NURSE: Hello , Mr. Leland .
LELAND: I 'm ready to go in now . You know when I was a young man , there was an impression around that nurses were pretty . It was no truer then than it is now .
NURSE: Here , let me take your arm , Mr. Leland .
LELAND: All right , all right . You wo n't forget , will you , about the cigars ? And tell them to wrap them up to look like toothpaste , or something , or they 'll stop them at the desk . That young doctor I was telling you about , he 's got an idea he wants to keep me alive .
SUSAN: How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions ?
THOMPSON: I 'd rather you just talked . Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane .
SUSAN: You would n't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane . Susan is thinking .
THOMPSON: How did you meet him ?
SUSAN: I had a toothache . Thompson looks at her .
KANE: Ow !
SUSAN: I 'm sorry , mister - but you do look awful funny .
KANE: What 's the matter with you ?
SUSAN: Toothache .
KANE: Hmm !
SUSAN: You 've got some on your face .
KANE: If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter - Susan starts to laugh again .
SUSAN: You are . You look like you 've een making mud pies . In the middle of her smile , the pain returns .
KANE: You 're no Venus de Milo .
SUSAN: If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
KANE: Thanks . Susan starts , with Kane following her .
SUSAN: My landlady prefers me to keep this door open when I have a gentleman caller . She 's a very decent woman . Ow !
KANE: I 'm sorry . They live here , too ?
SUSAN: No . They 've passed on . Again she puts her hand to her jaw .
KANE: Where 's the soap ?
SUSAN: In the water .
KANE: You 're very easily amused .
SUSAN: I always like to see the funny side of things . No sense crying when you do n't have to . And you 're so funny . Looking at you , I forget all about my toothache . Her face distorts in pain again .
KANE: I ca n't stay here all night chasing your pain away .
SUSAN: I know But you do look so silly .
KANE: Where 's the towel ?
SUSAN: On the chiffonier . Here .
KANE: Thanks .
SUSAN: I 've got a brush in the closet . As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off .
KANE: I 'll get these streets fixed , if it 's the last thing I do .
SUSAN: A chicken ?
KANE: No . But you 're close .
SUSAN: A rooster ?
KANE: You 're getting farther away all the time . It 's a duck .
SUSAN: Excuse me , Mr. Kane . I know this takes a lot of nerve , but - who are you ? I mean - I 'm pretty ignorant , guess you caught on to that -
KANE: You really do n't know who I am ?
SUSAN: No . That is , I bet it turns out I 've heard your name a million times , only you know how it is -
KANE: But you like me , do n't you ? Even though you do n't know who I am ?
SUSAN: You 've been wonderful ! I ca n't tell you how glad I am you 're here , I do n't know many people and -
KANE: And I know too many people . Obviously , we 're both lonely . Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes ?
SUSAN: I did n't run into you and I bet they 're not your Sunday clothes . You 've probably got a lot of clothes .
KANE: I was only joking ! This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth . Susan is bewildered .
SUSAN: Oh , me -
KANE: How old did you say you were ?
SUSAN: I did n't say .
KANE: I did n't think you did . If you had , I would n't have asked you again , because I 'd have remembered . How old ?
SUSAN: Pretty old . I 'll be twenty-two in August .
KANE: That 's a ripe old age - What do you do ?
SUSAN: I work at Seligman 's .
KANE: Is that what you want to do ?
SUSAN: I want to be a singer . I mean , I did n't . Mother did fo me .
KANE: What happened to the singing ? You 're not in a show , are you ?
SUSAN: Oh , no ! Nothing like that . Mothe always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me . Imagine ! An American girl , for one thing - and then my voice is n't really that kind anyway , it 's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like . A sudden look comes over Kane 's face .
KANE: Yes -
SUSAN: As a matter of fact , I do sing a little .
KANE: Would you sing for me ?
SUSAN: Oh , you would n't want to hear me sing .
KANE: Yes , I would . That 's why I asked .
SUSAN: Well , I -
KANE: Do n't tell me your toothache is othering you again ?
SUSAN: Oh , no , that 's all gone .
KANE: Then you have no alibi at all . Please sing .
SUSAN: I did a lot of singing after that . I sang for Charlie - I sang fo teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that , I did n't -
THOMPSON: What did you get ?
SUSAN: What do you mean ? Thompson does n't answer .
THOMPSON: He married you , did n't he ?
SUSAN: He was in love with me . But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him .
THOMPSON: What about that apartment ?
SUSAN: He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh , why should I bother ? You do n't elieve me , but it 's true . It just happens to be true . He was eally interested in my voice . What are you smiling for ? What do you think he built that opera house for ? I did n't want it . I did n't want to sing . It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him .
MATISTI: Impossible ! Impossible !
KANE: Your job is n't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents . You 're supposed to train her voice . Nothing more .
MATISTI: But , it is impossible . I will be the laughingstock of the musical world ! People will say -
KANE: If you 're interested in what people say , Signor Matisti , I may be able to enlighten you a bit . The newspapers , for instance . I 'm an authority on what the papers will say , Signor Matisti , because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco It 's all right , dear . Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason . Are n't you , maestro ?
MATISTI: Mr. Kane , how can I persuade you -
KANE: You ca n't . There is a silence . Matisti rises .
THE VOICE: - really pathetic .
SUSAN: You do n't propose to have yourself made ridiculous ? What about me ? I 'm the one that has to do the singing . I 'm the one that gets the razzberries . Last week , when I was shopping , one of the salesgirls did an imitation of me for another girl . She thought I did n't see her , but - Charlie , you might as well make up your mind to it . This is one thing you 're not going to have your own way about . I ca n't sing and you know it - Why ca n't you just -
KANE: My reasons satisfy me , Susan . You seem unable to understand them . I will not tell them to you again . You will continue with your singing .
KANE'S VOICE: Let 's have your keys , Raymond .
RAYMOND'S VOICE: Yes , sir .
KANE'S VOICE: The key must be in the other side . We 'll knock the door down , Raymond .
RAYMOND'S VOICE: Mrs. Kane -
KANE'S VOICE: Do what I say .
KANE: Get Dr. Corey .
RAYMOND: Yes , sir .
DR. COREY: She 'll be perfectly all right in a day or two , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Thank you . I ca n't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake . The sedative Dr. Wagne gave her is in a somewhat large ottle - I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her .
DR. COREY: I 'm sure that 's it .
KANE: There are no objections to my staying here with her , are there ?
DR. COREY: Not at all . I 'd like the nurse to e here , too .
KANE: Of course .
SUSAN: I could n't make you see how I felt , Charlie . I just could n't - I could n't go threw with singing again . You do n't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience do n't want you . That if you have n't got what they want - a real voice - they just do n't care about you . Even when they 're polite - and they do n't laugh or get restless or - you know They do n't want you . They just -
KANE: That 's when you 've got to fight them . That 's when you 've got to make them . That 's -
SUSAN: What time is it ? There is no answer .
KANE: Half past eleven .
SUSAN: I mean in New York .
KANE: Half past eleven .
SUSAN: At night ?
KANE: Yes . The bulldog 's just gone to press .
SUSAN: Hurray for the bulldog ! Half past eleven ! The shows have just let out . People are going to night clubs and restaurants . Of course , we 're different . We live in a palace - at the end of the world .
KANE: You always said you wanted to live in a palace .
SUSAN: Ca n't we go back , Charlie ?
KANE: One thing I 've never been able to understand , Susan . How do you know you have n't done them before ?
SUSAN: It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses .
KANE: You may be right - I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
SUSAN: It 's not a habit . I do it because I like it .
KANE: I was referring to myself . I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight . Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
SUSAN: Invite everybody ! Order everybody , you mean , and make them sleep in tents ! Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of thei own - with their own bath , where they know where everything is ?
KANE: I thought we might invite everybody to go on a picnic tomorrow . Stay at Everglades overnight . Please see that the arrangements are made , Susan . Kane turns away - to Bernstein .
BERNSTEIN'S VOICE: Oh , yes . How do you do , Mr. Kane ?
SUSAN: I 'm not going to put up with it . Kane turns to look at her .
KANE: You 're in a tent , darling . You 're not at home . And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice .
SUSAN: I 'm not going to have my guests insulted , just because you think - - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic , that 's their business . You 've got no ight -
KANE: I 've got more than a right as fa as you 're concerned , Susan .
SUSAN: Oh , I 'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I mus n't do !
KANE: You 're my wife , Susan , and -
SUSAN: I 'm not just your wife , I 'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be . I was once . Sometimes you get me to believing I never was .
KANE: We can discuss all this some othe time , Susan . Right now -
SUSAN: I 'll discuss what 's on my mind when I want to . You 're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it .
KANE: As far as you 're concerned , Susan , I 've never wanted anything - I do n't want anything now - except what you want .
SUSAN: What you want me to want , you mean . What you 've decided I ought to have - what you 'd want if you were me . But you 've never given me anything that -
KANE: Susan , I really think -
SUSAN: Oh , I do n't mean the things you 've given me - that do n't mean anything to you . What 's the difference etween giving me a bracelet o giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you 're going to keep crated up and neve look at ? It 's only money . It does n't mean anything . You 're not eally giving anything that belongs to you , that you care about .
KANE: Susan , I want you to stop this . And right now !
SUSAN: Well , I 'm not going to stop it . I 'm going to say exactly what I think . You 've never given me anything . You 've tried to buy me into giving you something . You 're - - it 's like you were bribing me ! That 's what it 's been from the first moment I met you . No matte how much it cost you - your time , your money - that 's what you 've done with everybody you 've eve known . Tried to bribe them !
KANE: Susan !
SUSAN: Love ! You do n't love anybody ! Me or anybody else ! You want to be loved - that 's all you want ! I 'm Charles Foster Kane . Whatever you want - just name it and it 's yours ! Only love me ! Do n't expect me to love you -
KANE: Susan , it seems to me -
SUSAN: Do n't tell me you 're sorry .
KANE: I 'm not sorry .
SUSAN: I 'm going to leave you .
KANE: No , you 're not .
SUSAN: Yes .
RAYMOND: Mrs. Kane would like to see you , Mr. Kane .
KANE: All right . Raymond waits as Kane hesitates .
RAYMOND: Marie has been packing since morning , Mr. Kane .
SUSAN: Tell Arnold I 'm ready , Marie . He can get the bags .
MARIE: Yes , Mrs. Kane . She leaves . Kane closes the door behind her .
KANE: Have you gone completely crazy ? Susan looks at him .
SUSAN: - And left ? Of course they 'll hear . I 'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people would n't know .
KANE: I wo n't let you go .
SUSAN: You ca n't stop me .
KANE: Do n't go , Susan .
SUSAN: Let 's not start all over again , Charlie . We 've said everything that can be said .
KANE: Susan , do n't go ! Susan , please !
SUSAN: I see - it 's you that this is being done to ! It 's not me at all . Not how I feel . Not what it means to me . I ca n't do this to you ! Oh , yes I can .
THOMPSON: The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people .
SUSAN: They have n't been tough on me . I just lost my money . But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
THOMPSON: I feel kind of sorry for him , all the same -
SUSAN: Do n't you think I do ? You say you 're going down to Xanadu ?
THOMPSON: Monday , with some of the boys from the office . Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff . We run a picture magazine , you know -
SUSAN: I know . If you 're smart , you 'll talk to Raymond . That 's the butler . You can learn a lot from him . He knows where the bodies are buried .
RAYMOND: Yes , sir - yes , sir , I knew how to handle the old man . He was kind of queer , but I knew how to handle him .
THOMPSON: Queer ?
RAYMOND: Yeah . I guess he was n't very happy those last years - he did n't have much reason to be -
FRED: Okay .
KATHERINE: Yes yes Mrs. Tinsdall - Very well . It 's the housekeeper .
RAYMOND: Yes ?
KATHERINE: She says there 's some sort of disturbance up in Mrs. Alexander 's oom . She 's afraid to go in .
KANE: Close the door , Raymond .
RAYMOND: Yes , sir .
KANE: Lock it - and keep it locked .
RAYMOND: Yes , sir -
KANE: Keep it locked .
RAYMOND: Okay .
KANE: Do you like poetry , Raymond ?
RAYMOND: Ca n't say , sir .
KANE: Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
RAYMOND: Yes , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Not my wife - not either of them .
RAYMOND: Oh , yes , sir .
KANE: Do you know what that is ?
RAYMOND: It 's a wall you bought in China , Mr. Kane .
KANE: Persia . It belonged to a king .
RAYMOND: How did you get him to part with it , Mr. Kane ?
KANE: He was dead That 's a poem . Do you know what it means ?
RAYMOND: No , I do n't , Mr. Kane .
KANE: I did n't used to be afraid of it .
RAYMOND: That 's the whole works , right up to date .
THOMPSON: Sentimental fellow , are n't you ?
RAYMOND: Yes and no .
THOMPSON: Well , thanks a lot .
RAYMOND: See what I mean ? He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years , anyway - but I knew how to handle him . That `` Rosebud '' - that do n't mean anything . I heard him say it . He just said `` Rosebud '' and then he dropped that glass ball and it oke on the floor . He did n't say anything about that , so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I could n't make out . But I knew how to take care of him . Thompson does n't answer .
THOMPSON: We 're leaving tonight . As soon as they 're through photographing the stuff -
RAYMOND: Allow yourself plenty of time . The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they do n't like to wait . Not now . I can remembe when they 'd wait all day if Mr. Kane said so . Raymond ushes Thompson into
ASSISTANT: NO . 9182
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: Yeah .
PHOTOGRAPHER: All right ! Next ! Better get that statue over there .
ASSISTANT: Okay .
RAYMOND: What do you think all that is worth , Mr. Thompson ?
THOMPSON: Millions - if anybody wants it .
RAYMOND: The banks are out of luck , eh ?
THOMPSON: Oh , I do n't know . They 'll clea all right .
ASSISTANT: `` Venus , '' Fourth Century . Acquired 1911 . Cost twenty-three thousand . Got it ?
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: Okay .
ASSISTANT: That 's a lot of money to pay for a dame without a head .
SECOND ASSISTANT: No . 483 . One desk from the estate of Mary Kane , Little Salem , Colorado . Value $ 6.00 .
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: Okay . A flashlight bulb goes off .
SECOND ASSISTANT: We 're all set to get everything . The junk as well as the art .
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: What 's that ?
RAYMOND: It 's a jigsaw puzzle .
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: We got a lot of those . There 's a Burmese Temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall . Raymond laughs .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Yeah , all in crates .
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: There 's a part of a Scotch castle over there , but we have n't bothered to unwrap it .
PHOTOGRAPHER: I wonder how they put all those pieces together ?
ASSISTANT: Iron stove . Estate of Mary Kane . Value $ 2.00 .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Put it over by that statue . It 'll make a good setup .
GIRL: Who is she anyway ?
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN: Venus . She always is .
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: He sure liked to collect things , did n't he ?
RAYMOND: He went right on buying - right up to the end .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Anything and everything - he was a egular crow .
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: wonder - You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell ?
THOMPSON: Charles Foster Kane .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Or Rosebud ? How about it , Jerry ?
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: Turn that thing off , will you ? It 's driving me nuts ! What 's Rosebud ?
PHOTOGRAPHER: Kane 's last words , are n't they , Jerry ? That was Jerry 's angle , was n't it , Jerry ? Did you ever find out what it means , Jerry ?
THOMPSON: No , I did n't .
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN: Say , what did you find out about him , anyway , Jerry ?
THOMPSON: Not much .
SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN: Well , what have you been doing ?
THOMPSON: Playing with a jigsaw puzzle - I talked to a lot of people who knew him .
GIRL: What do they say ?
THOMPSON: Well - it 's become a very clea picture . He was the most honest man who ever lived , with a streak of crookedness a yard wide . He was a liberal and a reactionary ; he was tolerant - `` Live and Let Live '' - that was his motto . But he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point , no matter how small it was . He was a loving husband and a good father - and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it . He had a gift for friendship such as few men have - he broke his oldest friend 's heart like you 'd throw away a cigarette you were through with . Outside of that -
THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN: Okay , okay .
GIRL: What about Rosebud ? Do n't you think that explains anything ?
THOMPSON: No , I do n't . Not much anway . Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he wanted , and then lost it . Maybe Rosebud was something he could n't get or lost . No , I do n't think it explains anything . I do n't think any word explains a man 's life . No - I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece .
RAYMOND: Throw that junk in , too .
FOR EDUCATIONAL: PURPOSES ONLY
HASARI: I 'll send money soon .
HASARI'S MOTHER: Do n't let the children out of you sight . Not for a moment .
SHAMBU: I do n't want to go . There are bad men with long knives who steal children .
HASARI'S FATHER: A man 's journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road . Yours begins here .
MANOOJ: Our farm has died , so we are moving to Calcutta to become rich !
MAX: Get serious .
BETSY: I swear to God , you never give anything enough time ! What did you expect in five days , Max ?
MAX: Only what they promise in the ochure Inner peace , serenity , and a nice chant that gets rid of this rock in my gut . E.S.T. , they do you in a weekend .
BETSY: I would really appreciate it if you would n't be terribly glib just now , Max .
MAX: Impossible to predict , Betsy Ilene Kahn . Maybe you better give me my ticket .
BETSY: Screw you , Max I paid for it ! How many times am I going to let you walk out on me and come back ?
MAX: I think only you can answer that , Betsy Ilene Kahn . She slaps him .
MAX: How you doin ' ? The Clerk gives Max a warm smile .
CLERK: Hello .
MAX: I 've always wanted to walk into a little airport just about like this one and ask the guy at the counter the following question . Ready ? The Clerk nods ; he 's at Max 's ervice .
CLERK: To Bombay . Tomorrow , at one o'clock in the afternoon .
VEEJAY: I say , are you looking for a way out of here ? We have an extra seat . Where are you wanting to go ?

MAX: Unattached trumpet player and ecently-certified associate guru .
MANOOJ: Daddy , I 'm scared .
HASARI: Scared ? No why ? This is very exciting . As soon as we get to our friend 's house , everything will be fine .
HASARI: Please , can you direct me to my friend at this address ? We are to stay with him .
VENDOR #1: There 's no such address as this in Calcutta .
HASARI: But that 's not possible .
VENDOR #1: Of course it is possible ! I have lived here all my life . You are new . Who would know if a place exists or does not ?
VENDOR #2: Bombay , perhaps . Delhi . Look there .
HASARI: Manooj , go and get some fruit . Come straight back .
GANGOOLY: Let me say only that the terrible malevolence that has visited you part of the country affects us all .
HASARI: Three years without rain . Nothing came out of the earth but debts .
GANGOOLY: Terrible . And now , the family on the street . It is not acceptable . And if I ca n't help , my name is not Mr. Gangooly Which , blessedly , it is . And now a smile as full as the sky above .
GANGOOLY: And now , one of the miracles of life in the city . One and two
HASARI: I have only seventy-five , but as soon as I have work
GANGOOLY: Give me the fifty , pay the rest next week . You 'll find work , I trust you . Are n't I from Bihar , too ? Yes .
RAVI: I hope this is all right . The oom has n't been aired or the bed turned , but
VEEJAY: Oh , he does n't care about that , do you , Max ? Here , look here .

MANUBAI: It 's all right for you to use my mother as your tour guide and meal ticket , because she 'll get something nice out of it . But what would I get ?
MAX: Well , gee , I do n't know . Maybe I could say something so amusing that you 'd laugh so hard it would eak that hot poker you have up your ass .

ANOTHER ANGLE: Swarming police .
BABU: The municipality has directed us to carry out the destruction of this settlement . All of you must go now !

BABU: Because this settlement is impeding construction work .
ARUN: We 're not moving ! Why should we move ? Who is the municipality ? We are ! This is our home !
BABU: I have my orders .
ARUN: If we 're driven from here , where should we go ?
BABU: I 'll give you five minutes to gather your things . Then , the settlement comes down .
ARUN: Why should you alone be burdened with such a task ? Let me help !
SHAMBU: Daddy , are we going to die here ?

JOAN: Oh , now we require that each visitor decide that for himself . This gentleman and a young lady ought you here .
MAX: Did I do that to your nose ? I 'm sorry .

MAX: Pardon the expression , but Jesus H. Christ .
MAX: You a doctor ?
JOAN: Oh no , I 'm a corporate executive . Doctor arrives at half seven , but only three days a week .

JOAN: Indeed . What brings you to ou country ?
MAX: I came to find my white light .
JOAN: Ah , yes . I take it you did n't find it .
MAX: Kept opening the doors and windows of my spirit , but could n't see a goddamn thing .

RAM: All right , you , come , step in here .
MAX: I hope you 're taking something fo that .
RAM: Now , fine , pull , go .
MAX: I say he can do it . I 'll bet you the fare he can do it . What do you think , rickshaw fans , can he do it ?

GOONDA: They 've brought a small present of respect .
ASHOKA: So , you want to be a human horse ?

MAX: Really ?
MAX: Oh great goodgood timing him !
COP: May I see your passport ?
MAX: Passport ? I 'm in the middle of a high speed chase . That guy
COP: Passport please .
MAX: It 's in my hotel room .
COP: Passport , please , now .
MAX: Ready my lips I do not have my passport with me at this Ah , I see , said the blind man .
JOAN: Well , all right , junior , so you 'll owe me three .
JOAN: Oh , it was just a whim in the eginning really to try to convince them not to be so bloody passive , that they could pull themselves up on their own . I get a little money from a Swiss organization . Now it 's become a it more than I can manage .
MAX: It 's got to be like trying to drill a hole in water , though .
JOAN: We just need a few more hands on this little life raft we 've set afloat here .
JOAN: You know what I 've come to think in my middle age , Max ?
MAX: Nope , no , earthly idea . You 're pretty much outta my league , thought-wise .
JOAN: There are really only three actions open to a person .
MAX: Only three okay . And what are they ?
JOAN: To run , to spectate , to commit .
MAX: Has it occurred to you that this obsession with charity is really a flaw in your character ?
JOAN: Charity ! It 's not charity , dea child , it 's love . You 're very adly twisted around , are n't you ?
MAX: One of us sure as hell is .
SUNIL: I 'm off for home , Sister Joan . A pleasure to meet you , Dr. Loeb .
MAX: The same .
SUNIL: See you day after tomorrow .
JOAN: Good night , God bless , Doctor . Generous young man .
MANOOJ: Are you the American doctor ? Are you coming here to help us .
MAX: No , I 'm the visiting American soccer star , El Max .
MANOOJ: Do you go to the cinema in America , El Max ?
MAX: When I was your age two movies , plus cartoons every Saturday .
SHAMBU: Daddy , there is the doctor from America . He saw two movies every Saturday . What 's in your fist ? Open , Daddy ! Shambu pries his father 's fist open seeds .
SHAMBU: Seeds ? Why ?
HASARI: So we can watch something grow .
RAM: Another few months , I 'll be able to pay off the moneylender in my village and go home and open a grocery shop . All around me sacks overflowing with all kinds of dal and rice , aromatic spices , piles of vegetables and at night , I 'll lie on my back beneath the trees sniffing fresh aubergines .
HASARI: Amrita , I saw a beautiful wedding sari today . Amrita is terribly embarrassed .
RAM: It was six hundred rupees only . He laughs at the impossibility of the price .
MAX: That 's only 40 dollars , is n't it ?
HASARI: If you have it .
MAX: I 'll send it to you from America when I get home tomorrow .
HASARI: That 's very generous but no , thank you .
MAX: Repayment for punching you in the nose .
HASARI: You have repaid me by sharing ou supper .
RAM: Doctor Big Brother , I myself would e willing to accept a gift . Could you give me five rupees in a note ten , perhaps . My ankle is badly swelled ; the higher the number the more the swelling sinks . Max has to laugh .
MAX: I do n't have a cent on me . I 'll owe you .
RAM: How much ?
POOMINA: Joan Di , my sister !
JOAN: It was Poomina who brought you to us . She has herself and he sister to support . It 's all right , Poomina . Anouar , what is it ?
ANOUAR: It 's Meeta ! It 's her time . But something is wrong . The midwives do n't know what to do ! Dr. Sunil , could he help , perhaps ?
JOAN: Dr. Sunil is n't here .
POOMINA: Meeta will die .
JOAN: Max , I would n't ask , but it 's an emergency . A pregnancy gone awry . It 's a leper . Could you have a look ?
MAX: I do n't have any experience with leprosy .
JOAN: Good Christ , son , because she 's a leper does n't mean she 's not uilt like a woman !
HASARI: I can run and get Dr. Sunil .
JOAN: It 's too far .
ALOKA: I could help . I 've had three abies .
RAM: You ca n't do that . They 're outcasts , they 're unclean . There are murmurs of assent from the others .
JOAN: Oh nonsense ! It 's not contagious ! A beat everyone fixed on Max .
HASARI: You 're a doctor , how can you not help ?
ALOKA: Will she die ?
MAX: Pull me two c.c . 's of Coramine . He nods at Aloka ; she illuminates the scene .
MAX: Tell her again to breathe in short little bursts now .
INSIDE: MAX I 've got the head . Come on , little baby , come on , little aby . Be alive , be alive , be alive .
MAX: We 've got it , we 've got it . Yeah !
JOAN: For a non-practicing doctor , that was pretty practiced .
MAX: Never been so scared in my life .
JOAN: Max , please , wo n't you change you mind ? We desperately need anothe doctor . Full-time . Think about it just give us a couple of months .
MAX: Ca n't do it . Maybe you 've got it in you to be a saint . I just do n't .
JOAN: Then what do you want ? What are you going to be when you grow up ? Good night , Aloka , Hasari .
ALOKA: Thank you for allowing me to go with you .
MAX: You could make a helluva nurse .
HASARI: I think perhaps you are a good man .
MAX: listens .
BETSY: I bought it , I got a refund !
MAX: But I want to go home with you .
BETSY: You want to go home with me ?
MAX: Yes .
BETSY: Then prove it .
MAX: Good how name it .
BETSY: Buy yourself a ticket .
MAX: I would love to do that , Betsy Ilene , boy would I love to do just that , but I 'm financially embarrassed at the
BETSY: Use your credit cards .
MAX: What credit cards ? You know I maxed them before we left . Just lend me
BETSY: No ! You wo n't pay me back ; you never have . Oh , Max !
MAX: They 're calling our flight . I want to go home with you , Betsy Ilene Kahn . Because I have a vision . It 's
MAX: I see you and me , Betsy Ilene Kahn , nibbling toward each othe through a quarter pounder with cheese , chugalugging a frosty light beer great taste ! Less filling ! Bowling ! I want to go owling , Besty Ilene Kahn ! He fires a strike through the watching crowd .
BETSY: Oh , stop it ! You have no earthly idea what you want , Max ! And stop calling me Betsy Ilene Kahn .
MAX: Is n't that your name ?
BETSY: You call me Betsy Ilene Kahn like you just met me yesterday .
MAX: What should I call you ? My girl , my significant other
BETSY: Do n't get cute ! You get cute and I swear to God - you told me once I look like my mother !
MAX: You do so what ?
BETSY: See you do n't understand !
MAX: How could I possibly not understand a conversation as easy as this one , Betsy Ilene .
BETSY: I hate you !
MAX: Na ya do n't .
BETSY: I stood by you for three years !
MAX: I know .
BETSY: I supported you through you internship !
MAX: You did .
BETSY: Why ? It was never working . What have I been thinking all these years that you 'd change ? You 're the most self-pitying , self-destructive , self
MAX: Will you at least call my mothe and ask her to empty my savings account and wire
BETSY: Do it yourself , Max . Call he collect . You should have called her weeks ago anyway just because she 's your mother ! White light , white light !
MAX: Guerilla theater , folks . 'All the world 's a stage . ' Do n't know if that word reached you here yet . If you 'd care to show you appreciation by a small donation
ANOUAR: Good morning , Joan Di . Dr. Loe said many of us could be helped ; that all it would take is money for medication .
JOAN: I 'll be happy to buy the medication , ut Dr. Loeb is not part of this endeavor , Anouar ; there is only his cherished memory .
ANOUAR: Then perhaps I am having visions .
MAX: Good morning ! Good morning ! Heckuva morning ! Getting ready to practice medicine without a license , Sister Joan ? You do n't see me soliciting conversions , do you ?
JOAN: Well , well , well , I do so love to e surprised .

JOAN: And I 'm a bloody bathing beauty .
MAX: Okay , so I got left .
JOAN: Smart girl So how long am I stuck with you ?
MAX: Two weeks or until Mom sends me a ticket .

JOAN: Two months and that 's my final offer .
MAX: Done .
JOAN: Jesus and Mary . The Lone Range ides again .
MAX: Thanks got it .
SCHOOL GIRL: Hasari , where have you been ? I 've een waiting almost five minutes .
HASARI: I 'm sorry , forgive me . It wo n't happen again .
SCHOOL GIRL: We 're not going to school today . You 're taking my mother and me to the Bara Bazar . I 'm getting married !
HASARI: Oh , I am so pleased for you !
MOTHER: Good morning , Hasari .
HASARI: Good morning , missus . Briskly , he takes up the shafts and sets off .
MOTHER: Turn right at that corner , Hasari .
HASARI: It 's farther that way , missus .
MOTHER: No , not really . Turn there , please .
SCHOOL GIRL: You must remember this shop , Hasari , when it 's your daughter 's time . This is the nicest in the city .
ASHOKA: Not working ? How will my fathe eat this evening ?
HASARI: I was just
ASHOKA: You have a daughter ?
HASARI: Yes , Babu .
ASHOKA: Keep working . Give this to Siste Joan and your friend the docto when you go home .
MAX: He 's just malnourished . Is she giving him the milk we gave her o selling it ?
ALOKA: Not all . Most .
MAX: Tell her to give all the milk to the baby .
SUNIL: Good night , I 'll see you day afte tomorrow .
MAX: Good night , Sunil .
SELIMA: Very special supper for you tonight , Doctor Big Brother ! Will you stay ?
MAX: Wish I could , Selima , because I 'm sure hungry ! Sixteen hours of pestilence and misery always make me famished . I have to go with my man Anouar tonight . I 've got lepers to heal !
ANOUAR: No , no , you know how patient we are . Eat , eat .
MAX: You 're not tired , are you ?
ALOKA: Not if you 're not .
JOAN: Well , I think we 've got three very good potential scholars here .
HASARI: It 's more than a father could hope .
MAX: Fifteen years from now Miami , Florida , Dr. Manooj Pal , in association with Dr. Maxwell Loeb .
HASARI: From the godfather 's son . For you and the doctor .
GHATAK: Acha !
JOAN: We 'd like to better serve the entire community , Mr. Ghatak .
GHATAK: Of course . That 's very good . Admirable . And we 'd be pleased to ent you suitable space . But you must understand that certain payments will go up .
JOAN: I understand the rent would have to go up if we rent large quarters from you , Mr. Ghatak , but why should we have to pay more protection ?
GHATAK: More people , more potential trouble . Strangers . If I do n't charge you , what will I tell others ?
JOAN: But we ca n't afford it !
GHATAK: Surely if you can expand , you can pay more .
MAX: Am I stupid , but is n't this protection money money we 're paying you to protect us from you ?
GHATAK: We live in chaotic times , Miss Bethel , Doctor . I control the City of Joy and maintain it as a model of harmony . It 's a miracle , ut a very fragile miracle .
MAX: And how are we threatening you miracle ?
GHATAK: I admire your courage in choosing to work in such a violent place , Miss Bethel .
GHATAK: Doctor , do you like our music ?
MAX: Well , I ca n't say I 've developed a craving for it yet .
GHATAK: It 's difficult to appreciate what we do n't understand , is n't it ? Let me put it another way The world is a terrible place . Only the ruthless prevail . My son will make the arrangements with you .
MAX: I like your taste in neckwear .
ASHOKA: The entire package we 're proposing will cost you three thousand rupees a month . Joan is taken aback by the sum .
JOAN: If we pay you that , we wo n't have any money for supplies .
ASHOKA: I 'm told you 're very resourceful .
MAX: I think I see a solution . May I ? What if we were to work out a profit-sharing arrangement ? We give you a share of our net profit .
ASHOKA: How do you expect to make a profit off of lepers and the poor , Doctor ?
MAX: Beats the hell outta me , asshole . But you 've obviously found a way .
JOAN: Have you gone right off you ocker ! ? These people do n't have a sense of humor . Are you trying to get yourself killed ?
MAX: I do n't think so but with me , any duplicity is possible .
JOAN: Stop it , you you you nudnick !
ASHOKA: Who gave you your rickshaw ?
HASARI: The Godfather .
ASHOKA: Who provides the food you eat ?
HASARI: The Godfather .
ASHOKA: Remember Loyalty .
SALADDIN: The Godfather is at least civilized . The son is vicious . Remember the last elections the Molotov coctails , the blows with iron bars . They 'll throw us out . We wo n't be able to find anyone else to rent to us . We 'll just have to agree to pay what he wants .
MEHBOUB: Saladdin 's right . Neither nature nor the people with the powe have any conscience . We have to pay .
ASHISH: What do you say , Doctor Big Brother ?
SUNIL: I think we must try to break the Godfather 's hold on us .
MAX: How the hell do you proceed with caution against these people ? You ca n't . You have to risk everything .
ASHISH: We ? You have an airplane ticket . Still , he 's clearly piqued a lot of support .
SUNIL: You know , Max , this is not American gangster television .
SALADDIN: Yes , if you 're wrong , you do n't have to be here .
MAX: I 'm not wrong . You bow your heads , you plead with your Gods to do what you wo n't do yourselves . You put up with this nightmare as if there were no choice . I 'm telling you , if you do n't stand up to that little pimple face now , he 'll own you for the rest of your lives .
ANOUAR: Even though I am invisible to some of you and I do n't have a complete set of legs to stand on , I stand with the Doctor Big Brother . Maybe nature does n't have a conscience or those with the power , but do n't we ?
MARGARETA: I agree with Anouar and Max Daddah . I think it 's worth the chance .
HASARI: Is it permitted to speak ?
SUNIL: Sister Joan , what do you think , eally ?
JOAN: Well , I think Max has hit on the heart of what we 're trying to build here a self-help society . Each of us has to decide for himself . As for me , I suppose I think , eally , that if the bastards are going to suck us dry , I 'd like to get in a couple of good left- handers before I turn the othe cheek .
SALLADIN: But who will rent to us !
SURYA: I have a property I will rent you for two hundred rupees a month , and not a rupee less . As fo protection you are on your own .
MANOOJ: Doctor Big Brother , are n't you going to smoke your evening cigar ? Max points at his trumpet , continues playing .
RAM: It has come to me tonight to write a letter to my wife .
MAX: Okay shott .
RAM: Yes what is the word that word when land is watered with canals ?
MAX: `` Irrigation '' ?
RAM: Yes , yes , that word , I want that word in the letter .
MAX: Well ?
RAM: Well ?
MAX: What would you like to say to your wife ?
RAM: I do n't know , Max Daddah . If I knew what to say to my wife , I 'd never have left home .
MANOOJ: Why do you have to go home , Docto Babu ?
ALOKA: Because he does n't live here , Manooj . This is not his home .
MAX: On no ! Lepers ! Lepers in my neighborhood !
ANOUAR: Sshh ! Doctor Big Brother , please , we are pretending not to be lepers .
MAX: Oh , oh , I did n't get the concept of course , not lepers . I think you 're going to fool a lot of people . I have only one question Why are you here ?
ANOUAR: We 've come to take you to the dispensary in grand style on this special day , have n't we , Hasari ?
HASARI: Yes .
MAX: Na , I 'll just trot alongside Hasari .
HASARI: No , please , get in .
ANOUAR: Meeta 's very excited by this ride through Calcutta . You see , she 's never been sightseeing before .
MAX: You 're incorrigible , Anouar .
ANOUAR: Yes , yes , I know , thank you very much .
ALLEYWAY: Where Ashoka waits .
ASHOKA: You taking that to the clinic ? You like it there ? And they love your smile , do n't they ?
LEPER WOMAN: It is too beautiful to believe .
GOONDA: Good morning , Sister to the poor .
JOAN: Yes , Mr. Bhose ?
GOONDA: Those people are n't coming into this neighborhood .
JOAN: They are going to be treated at the dispensary . You have no ight to stop them .
ANOTHER ANGLE: Hasari arrives with Max , Anouar , and Meeta .
JOAN: Go ahead , Aloka , take them inside .
GOONDA: That was a mistake , Doctor .
MAX: The mistake 's yours , putz . Get these people inside .
MAX: Oh , little girl , little girl Joan is suddenly beside Ashoka .
JOAN: We 'll pay ! All right then , so by all means , protect us !
ASHOKA: In a world such as ours , everyone needs protection . For the fee we discussed , from this day forward , I can assure you nothing like this will happen again .
ASHOKA: You . I warned you about the company you keep .
ALOKA: Will she Her face , will it
MAX: If she 's very careful and does n't do anything to open the wound , the scarring will be minimal . Do you understand ? You ca n't You have to stay here . You make her stay here .
JOAN: I 'll try .
MAX: Do n't goddamn try , Joan ! Goddamn do it !
ASHOKA: Well . What have you got to say ?
HASARI: I told them that your fathe provides us with a great deal and that Ashoka slams his hand on the register .
ASHOKA: From this minute , you are off the list ! You will leave your rickshaw here where it will be reserved for a man who deserves our trust . He stands up . Hasari is near tears .
HASARI: Please , Babu , this is as if the ground has opened up . I have to speak to Mr. Ghatak !
ASHOKA: My father 's ill ! You are speaking to me !
HASARI: I have a family !
ASHOKA: The decision is made . I have made it . Now get out before I have Mr. Bhose break your legs .
MAX: I just do n't I do n't want to I do n't want to care ! I do n't want to care this much ! I just do n't want to be invested in you people . In people ! I became a goddamn doctor because my goddamn fathe wanted me to be a goddamn docto ecause he was a goddamn doctor ! He was the goddamn king of doctors ! It 's too goddamn hard !
JOAN: Not everyone 's cut out for this . You did the best you could . Better than many . It 's all right .
MAX: I did n't do the best I could ! I did what I always do ! I shot my ig mouth off and did a half-assed job . And what I want to do now is I want to go back to America and make money and live a life without entanglements and demands and people hanging on me .
JOAN: You know , the fact is from the minute we 're born we 're shipwrecked . Some see that as a lifetime of drowning , of fear , others only to endure , but to triumph . It 's all in the individual spirit , is n't it ?
MAX: Got it To run , to spectate , to commit . Running spectator .
JOAN: Then , by all means , go home , Max , and go with my blessing and my eternal friendship .
HASARI: They took away my rickshaw .
MAX: So what do you want me to do about it get it back for you ? Max takes away a step . Stops .
HASARI: But I trusted you .
MAX: Well , that was your goddamn mistake !
HASARI: I do n't know how I 'm going to pay the rent , how we 're going to eat .
ALOKA: We have what is saved for Amrita 's dowry .
HASARI: The children must leave the school ; they 'll have to work . And you will not have anything to do with the clinic or those people anymore . Ram joins them .
RAM: What I earn is yours , too .
HASARI: You ca n't support all of us . You have a family in your village , too . Hasari touches his friend and goes into
HASARI: Take more . The Attendant shakes his head .
GANGOOLY: Not well , brother ?
HASARI: Still stealing from refugees ?
GANGOOLY: Well , yes , I remember you , of course hello ! I am delighted to see you yes . And tell me immediately , please your little family , your beautiful children , everyone eats , yes . Come , have a cup of tea or a little something stronger , we must celebrate .
HASARI: I 'm touched .
GANGOOLY: My friend , I am lame and I am poor . Does that mean that I should n't survive ? Huh ? When a man is struggling in a rough sea , he clutches onto what he can or he drowns . You do n't look so well .
HASARI: I lost my rickshaw .
GANGOOLY: Ach ! I have an offer . No , listen ! Shiva be my witness , you must at least think about this . Please , I can help Or my name is not Mr. Gangooly .
HASARI: Which , fortunately , it is .
GANGOOLY: Remove the children from the school no , why ? When you , the father , can make a small sacrifice . Nature has foreseen your plight . For she has given you two eyes , yes , and two kidneys . But . To live , you have need of one only . I have a friend who sold his kidney this one and now believe me , this is the truth he lives in a brick home which he owns . That smile .
JOAN: Hasari has forbid her to have anything more to do with us . He 'd e very angry if he knew she was seeing you off . Max looks at Joan . Looks out the window .
MAX: This is for Poomina . When I get home
ALOKA: You did good things . Thank you for coming to ou country . And now Max heads out the door .
JOAN: It 's not like he 's royalty o anything , so I 'm not persuaded we have to wait for the plane to actually take off .
ALOKA: No . We should go .
MAX: What were those three choices again ?
MAX: I need Aloka at the clinic . All right , they , the patients , need her . She 's a good nurse . Come on , man , this is between you and me . Why take the kids out of school , why punish your wife ?
HASARI: It 's not a question of money . We 'll survive on our own .
ALOKA: Maybe he 's right . The clinic is for everyone and if I am needed
HASARI: No ! I 'm your husband and you 'll do as I say ! Unless , of course , you 've become an American wife and then you 'll do as you please !
MAX: Hand me the scissors , please . Helpfully Said hands him the tweezers .
ANOUAR: Max Daddah , you are finished ? Follow me .
MAX: You did n't steal this .
RAMATULLAH: The police , Sahib , they stole it . We stole it from them .
MAX: How much ?
THE RICKSHAW: Piled up in its ruin .
MAX: I 'm good with my hands . You 're good with yours . What do you say ?
HASARI: If I were to go on the street with this machine , I would end up in a gutter with my throat cut .
MAX: Well , it 's yours if you want it . You know the license , the cops , all that can be fixed . You 'll own this it 'll have nothing to do with the Godfather .
HASARI: Doctor Daddah , I 'm just a small man . Do n't try to tempt me again with big thoughts .
MAX: You did n't want me to quit . Well , I came back .
HASARI: But can you be trusted ?
MAX: I hope so .
MAX: Going to look for work ?
RAM: Yes , he is . Ram has a small coughing fit .
MAX: Are you taking your medicine ?
RAM: Yes , yes , but look at this .
ALOKA: He 's very proud .
MAX: You must have had a good doctor . Still no running , jumping , picking up anything heavy . And you stay here . You 're going to help Siste Joan and you 're going to school . Do you understand ?
THE GOONDA: Time to collect the rent , Sister .
JOAN: Of course . Come with me , please .
HASARI: Close the door !
MAX: I promised Manooj and Shambu I 'd take them to the movies . Is it all right ?
HASARI: If a man makes a promise
MAX: Thanks , guys . Who wants to go fo more peanuts ?
MANOOJ: I ca n't decide if I want to be Kumar Kapur or a doctor .
MAX: Ha ha ! You can be both ! Manooj Pal , swashbuckling physician !
MANOOJ: You 're so much fun , El Max . I wish my daddy were as much fun as you .
MAX: I wish my father loved me like your father loves you . Your dad 's a very special man . And now , en garde !
MAX: I ca n't do anything here . He 's got a compound fracture , he hemorrhaging . We 've got to get to a hospital now !
JOAN: You 'll never get a taxi at this hour .
MAX: They 'll admit him , but we have to pay for the blood . I gave him all I had . He wants more . Do you have anything ?
ALOKA: Sister Joan gave me this .
MAX: We have n't got any more !
ATTENDANT: Not possible . You ca n't give care , you 're an American . You must be an Indian doctor .
MAX: Then take me to one !
HASARI: You 're my wife , Aloka , you and my children are all my wealth . But if Max Daddah and Big Sister Joan have need of you , you may go to them .
MAX: We pinned his leg . Couple of months , he 'll be better than ever . They want to keep him today . We 're a good team . Gim me five .
JOAN: I do n't think it was an accident . I think they were aiming for Max . So , what we have to ask ourselves is whether his presence is endangering all of us .
ANOUAR: Even from my low vantage point , I know this It 's the son . He 's mad .
HASARI: Max Daddah is our friend . If they 're trying to harm him , then they 're trying to harm all of us . We must stand by him as one .
RAM: Doctor Daddah , please , very important , only one moment .
MAX: This is going to cost me every upee I did n't make today . Ram thrusts an envelope into Max 's hand .
RAM: So ?
MAX: So , what have you been doing incubating it ?
RAM: I was afraid . Ram waits , his hands twisting each other .
MAX: 'My dear husband '
RAM: Oh that 's very hopeful so far !
MAX: 'Your words brought tears of joy to my arid eyes . '
RAM: Oh , I 'm in love ! My words ought tears to her arid eyes ! What does that mean arid ? Manooj throws his hand up .
MANOOJ: I know ! Dry .
MAX: Correct . Her eyes were dry , you letter irrigated them .
RAM: Aaah !
CHOMOTKAR: This is a puka nasgar . What a curse that you ca n't use it .
HASARI: I 'm going on the streets tomorrow .
MAX: Listen . I do n't want you to think I 'm crazy , but I do n't think that truck was an accident .
MAX CONT'D: I think Ashoka was after me . You can bet he 'll be after you too .
HASARI: I 'm going to speak to his father .
MAX: Can I go with you ? I 'll go with you . Can I go with you if I shut up ? A beat and Hasari gives him a small nod .
HASARI: Babu , please , I beg you , hea my words !
GHATAK: Wait .
HASARI: May I say first , Babu , I wish you long life and good health .
GHATAK: Acha ! They take me now to the scientists . They stick needles in me , take pictures of my insides , study them , and then tell me what I know .
HASARI: When you gave me work , I swore I would be as your youngest brother . Your son thinks I have been disloyal . He took my rickshaw . With my friend , I have remade this one . I beg you to let me go again onto the streets . I have my family .
GHATAK: It is very beautiful .
HASARI: Thank you , Babu .
GHATAK: If I may say , it has an allure .
HASARI: An allure , Babu thank you . The Godfather stares at Hasari , then at Max .
GHATAK: The world is chaos . We struggle to build something permanent , then our bodies betray us , our sons etray us . Yes , you may take your rickshaw out . If you can face up to my son .
HASARI: If a man dies and he 's not burned , what do you think becomes of his soul ?
GANGOOLY: Oh , it 's a noble fate . If indeed your wheel ceases to turn , you will help educate somewhere in this great world a fine doctor .
HASARI: What 's going on ?
CHOMOTKAR: The Godfather ill ! The son is aising the rent !
ASHOKA: Do you know how much it costs to change the spoke in a wheel ? O how much baksheesh I have to pay the police ?
RAMATULLAH: We have n't been breaking ou acks between the shafts of ou ickshaws in order to weep fo you ! Hasari continues forward , his eyes on Ashoka .
CHOMOTKAR: The only thing that matters is the undle of rupees we take to the munshi each month to feed and to answer the daily needs of ou children !
RASSOUL: Listn to me ! Listen now ! Listen to me ! Friends ! I ask you to vote for an unlimited strike . Inkalabad zindabad ! Long live the evolution ! Rickshaw Workers Union zindabad !
ASHOKA: That 's what I thought . All ight , get to work ! Customers are waiting !
HASARI: Friends ! The Godfather at least is a caring man ! This one , though , the son
ASHOKA: We helped this man ! We gave him a job , a place to live ! This is how he shows his gratitude . Get on the streets now ! Or turn in your machines ! Hasari gets up and tries to speak .
HASARI: Friends do n't ! If we stand
JUDGE: Silence ! This man will be permitted to use his rickshaw without let o hindrance . And I will make a estraining order against Mr. Ghatak .
HASARI: Fifty rupees , Your Honor ? That 's
JUDGE: Pay at this time or spend seven days in jail !
RAMATULLAH: Hasari !
RASSOUL: Hasari !
HASARI: Really a boyfriend , Amrita ?
AMRITA: No ! Amrita whacks Manooj .
MANOOJ: Yes , she does . His name is Subash Ghosh . His father owns the workshop .
HASARI: Is there someone you care about ?
RAM: At my wedding I became so frightened , my father gave me things to drink to calm me down . I went out to piss and fell asleep under the village tree . When I woke I thought it was the tree I 'd married . I still love that tree .
ASHOKA: Go home , Doctor .
JOAN: What 's happened ?
MAX: Ashoka ordered me to go home . Well , I 've come home .
CHOMOTKAR: What a joy it is to survey this disaster ! We will all make a fortune !
HASARI: The monsoon is the great Durga 's gift to the human horse !
RAM: I 'm wet and I 'm cold . You daughter is getting married . Time is passing . I want to go home to my wife .
RAMATULLAH: Hasari !
MARWARI #4: How much to the market ?
HASARI: Eight rupees .
MARWARI #4: What ! I wo n't pay it !
HASARI: Who else needs a ride ? I am available at a price ! Several others crowd and shove toward him .
MARWARI #4: No ! Take me I 'll pay , let 's go !
HASARI: The price just went up ! Ten upees ! In advance .
ANOUAR: I think Aloka would have a gentle touch than you , Max Daddah . Maybe she should perform this surgery on her own . Aloka ducks her eyes , embarrassed .
MAX: Last time you told me you were more than two women could manage .
ANOUAR: Yes , but given a choice between one and none , I will accept the one .
MAX: Okay , you ought to be good fo another few days . Send in the next patient .
HASARI: Here ! I 'm here !
MR. GHOSH: And I a partner in the workshop where your daughter is employed . Were you aware of that ?
HASARI: Yes , yes , I was , my daughter told me , thank you .
MR. GHOSH: Yes , well then , perhaps you can tell me why I would permit my son to marry your daughter .
UNCLE #1: Just a moment , please .
MR. GHOSH: What could he possibly offer ?
UNCLE #1: Probably nothing . But perhaps , in fairness , we should find out .
MAX: My dear friends , it 's just occurred to me what inspired me to stay here .
MARGARETA: What 's that , Doctor Big Brother ?
MAX: The opportunity to acquire waterfront property at a reasonable price .
JOAN: I hate to admit it , junior , but that was actually quite witty .
MAX: I 'd throw my cape down , but I 'm all out of dry capes .
RAVI: We heard you were still here . Vijay wanted to send some things .
MAX: Shall we unload the car ?
RAVI: Yes , yes , by all means .
MANUBAI: I 'm surprised . I really did n't think you 'd stick it out .
MAX: People grow older ; sometimes they even grow up .
ARISTOTLE JOHN: Where can we take them ? We ca n't take them back to the clinic . No one will put up with it .
SALADDIN: We ca n't let them drown , can we ? Eh , Max Daddah ?
HASARI: It 's too deep !
MEETA: Anouar !
ANOUAR: Max Daddah !
MAX: We 're here ! We 're here !
OTHERS: It 's the doctor . Save Doctor Big Brother !
MAX: Oh , Jesus , the guy went to sleep when he was supposed to be working ? I got ta get up
JOAN: Sshh , sshh , sshh ! No heroics , junior . Lay back . You 're all ight .
MAX: All right . Yeah , I am , I 'm all right .
HASARI: I can offer no more than I 've offered ! No more ! All right , I 'll add two dhotis , two vests , and a punjabi . But that 's all .
MR. GHOSH: That 's all ? Did he say that 's all ?
HASARI: My daughter 's qualities will make up for what is lacking .
SUBASH'S FATHER: Well , it wo n't do ! I am firm in equiring for my exceptional son the bicycle , 1000 repees and one ounce of gold .
HASARI: That 's robbery ! The child of a ajah might be worth that , and I 'm not even sure of that ! Impossible ! We linger on Shambu a moment .
ANOTHER ANGLE: Manooj , seated between Hasari and Max .
SISTER CECILIA: Well , indeed I think Sister Joan is right we 've got a prospect here . We 'll start you off with a few classes ; if that works out , we 'll make a proper student of you .
MAX: Hey , come on , do n't do this .
VOICE: Well , what 's the problem here ? They turn , Ashoka . Behind him , the Goonda .
ASHOKA: You 've become very brave of late , have n't you ?
MAX: Do n't do this .
ASHOKA: Oh , I do what I please . You see , my father 's dead , I 'm in charge now . So you will get off my streets , you will leave my country , and that clinic and school will close .
MAX: Why ?
ASHOKA: My father was weak . He let you and your European friend give these little people ideas . It 's over .
MAX: You ca n't do this !
HASARI: Get back ! Stay back !
ASHOKA: No , no , come forward . Come .
HASARI: Please , do n't touch her , Babu .
ASHOKA: What did you say ?
HASARI: I said , Please , do n't touch her .
ASHOKA: She 's going to give someone a lot of enjoyment . Yes .
ASHOKA: He said 'please ' did n't he ? 'Please , do n't touch her ? '
HASARI: Life is hard enough . No more . Leave us alone .
GOONDA: You wo n't be bothered again .
MAX: Why do n't you go on home . I 'll stay with him .
HASARI: A man 's journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road . And you have to remember that you can never give up . We pray that life will bless us , that we will e kings , with possessions and money that we can rule over all around us . But it 's a mist ; the only thing that makes it possible to endure life is our love , one for the other .
OUTSIDE: The many hands with their ringing bells .
SHAMBU: Is my father going to die ?
MAX: Get serious .
HASARI: Get serious ! I 've agreed to the icycle , I 've agreed to the 1000 upees ! I can go no further . I have nothing more to give !
MAX: How 's it going ?
RAM: All that stands between them now is the ounce of gold . Max Daddah , Joan Di is she a good eader ?
MAX: What do you mean ?
RAM: She read this letter to me . But I think she must have read it wrong . She said my wife writes that irrigation has come to ou village .
MAX: But that 's great .
RAM: But it means I should go home to my wife .
MAX: I thought that 's why we 've been writing all these letters .
RAM: Yes , of course , I love her from here , yes ; but , what if I go home and find I do n't love her from there .
SHAMBU: Daddy needs gold , right ?
HASARI: You never did belong to me . You were only lent to me by God until you marry and continue the wheel of life .
KING ACRISIUS: Now we end the debate about tactics and begin to plan fo victory .
QUEEN DANAE: My King ! Has the strategy been set so quickly ?
QUEEN DANAE: Come to your Queen , my King .
RAGING: My own subjects condemn me ! They dare judge me ? And what emboldens this treachery ?
STEWARD: You are mistaken , my King . None would risk your anger
KING ACRISIUS: It is Zeus who warps my kinadom ! Zeus the ungodly , Zeus the defiler
KING ACRISIUS: He cuckolds me in my castle , rapes my precious Queen ! This is a low , conniving God But I have bested him on this day and humbled the great Prime .
SWIGS ALE: Tell me , Panos , who rivals Zeus on Olympos ? Who does the Fearless One fear ?
STEWARD: I beg you , Your Highness
KING ACRISIUS: Tell me what the Priests say !
STEWARD: Tiamat Tiamat , Queen of the Deep .
WHISPERING: Those who dare , whisper she covets Zeus ' throne and schemes to achieve it , the ambitious Goddess of the Dark Oceans
KING ACRISIUS: Yes , Tiamat ! And today I have honored her .
OCEAN: I honor Zeus ' rival with all that was dear to me and commit double murder in he honor
KING ACRISIUS: so that Zeus will know I despise and disdain him and spit on his foul name !
OLD MAN: Thoth the Quick ( sensing the boy 's
CONFUSION: Messenger of the Gods . Bound fo Olympos .
THOTH: My lord .
ZEUS: ( rumbles , like
THUNDER: We have debated , we have voted , and it is decided . We offer the Humans peace . Thoth , you will take them the terms of a treaty
SCORNFULLY: A treaty !
TIAMAT: We do n't negotiate with them ! We dictate to them . Their place is to beg . They have forgotten thei ole and have denied us the sustenance of their prayers .
APHRODITE: Our mercy will give them reason to e grateful . They will bow down and whisper our names with more passion than before .
TIAMAT: They will bow down when we snap their backs ! Mercy ? We are Gods ! Some of us remember that and are not afraid
ZEUS: Silence ! Or learn what it is to e afraid ! The debate is over , the votes cast
ZEUS: We guarantee an armistice , we shield the bridegroom and the Joppan royal family . ( turning again on
TIAMAT: And we do not interfere in thei actions . We leave them undisturbed unless-invoked by name to enter their affairs .
SET: And if they refuse our terms ?
ZEUS: They have suffered terrible losses . They will not pass up a chance for peace .
SET: This is your rightful place to take .
TIAMAT: Soon enough , Set . Zeus has grown weaker than I knew .
SET: So have they all . They no longe see clearly .
DISDAINFUL: They 're beginning to think like Men . But you and I shall not . Set agrees , his eyes searching her face .
TIAMAT: We will manage these thick-witted Humans to our own ends . Yes , we will be bound by great Zeus ' rules until their fragile membranes tear . We dare not interfere with these insects
AMOUN: The emissary approaches . Take your time in your responses , debate nothing
TESTY: I 've received ambassadors before .
AMOUN: None like this .
KEPHEUS: I 'm not cowed . If these arrogant Gods are so powerful , why are they the ones seeking a truce ?
PATIENTLY: I only recommend you take care with the tone of the conversation . A truce would benefit all
KEPHEUS: In my palace , I decide how the discourse proceeds , not some messenger sent on errands by Zeus .
THOTH: as do all Gods and all men .
DEFERENTIAL: Thoth the Quick , I am Amoun , the King 's Magi Strategos . We welcome you with humility , honored by you visit from the realm of the Gods .
KEPHEUS: I am a reasonable man . Everyone wishes for the conflict to cease .
THOTH: Zeus above all . He has so long desired the tragedy end , he made a plan that began twenty-five years ago .
CASSIOPEIA: Twenty-five years ! How is that possible ?
THOTH: Beauteous Queen , let Thoth limn for you the forethought and wisdom of Zeus , God of Gods .
KEPHEUS: A treaty marriage ?
THOTH: You have a daughter of age .
GASPS: Andromeda !
KEPHEUS: Surely Zeus does not ask a mortal father to give his daughter to a God .
THOTH: No . Such a union would be unclean . Years ago Zeus created a scion of mixed blood . Half-man , half-God . Bred for just this union . That is how important Zeus considers this truce .
CASSIOPEIA: Is my only daughter to marry a demigod , not of this earth ?
THOTH: A prince , of both Olympian and Human royalty . A chosen one .
KEPHEUS: I have heard of no such demigod .
AMOUN: Majesty , if I may the young man does exist . He lives in a small fishing village on the isle of Seriphos .
KEPHEUS: You knew about this and said nothing ?
ACCUSATORY: Just which king do you serve ?
AMOUN: My Queen , I serve only the great order of things . I was the boy 's tutor years ago .
KEPHEUS: How haughty this boy must be , who knows he is half-God .
AMOUN: He knows nothing and believes himself an ordinary man . He has never left his village . He can be overconfident , but it is from inexperience , not arrogance .
CASSIOPEIA: What assurance do we have that ou daughter will be safe ?
LOSING PATIENCE: You have my word , as Ambassador of the Gods .
KEPHEUS: With our daughter 's future at stake , we do not bestow trust easily .
THREATENING: If any harm should come to her
ICY: The Princessa shall not be harmed .
AMOUN: ( urgently , to the
KING: Your Majesty
SHAKEN: Of course of course your word is unquestioned here .
KEPHEUS: Where is the lucky young suitor ?
SPYROS: Your grieving does Anteros no good . It comforts only you .
PERSEUS: It 's my fault he 's gone .
SPYROS: He was careless with the net . Perseus gives him a hard look .
PERSEUS: So it 's his fault . Not mine , not fate , not the Gods ?
DISDAINFULLY: The Gods delude themselves about their power and watch in envy while we act . We make our own history .
PERSEUS: Now my history is I let my friend die in my arms . I made it back , why could n't he ?
SPYROS: What you do , no other man can do . Have you not noticed ?
PERSEUS: To what purpose ? I failed him .
SCOFFS: Purpose ! Looking for purpose is what ensnares men in the superstition of the Gods , as surely as your friend was caught in that net . And all the searching leads down to the same place .
PERSEUS: You always say that my abilities are greater than other men 's . But they were not enough to save him .
SPYROS: You are still a man , confined by man 's limits . You are just as likely to fail as succeed .
PERSEUS: How is that greater than othe men ?
SPYROS: Ordinary men fail most of the time . The trawler rounds a point on the island .
TEKLA: Mother wants you to come in fo supper . ( as he is
UNRESPONSIVE: Perseus , why are you so sad ?
TEKLA: I still do n't understand .
SPYROS: Your mother can explain . She elieves everything has an explanation , even if we have to make it up .
WARNING LOOK: It 's one of the reasons I love you , Marmara .
TEKLA: Tell me ! Why is there war between Man and the Gods ?
MARMARA: At the beginning of time , when Man was young , he prayed to the Gods . His belief in the Gods gave his life meaning . It was a good thing .
SPYROS: If you consider superstition , fea and darkness good things
IGNORING HIM: But Man grew , as children do , and he turned away from the Gods . Be egan to put his faith in othe things . Perseus watches the debate with fiery eyes .
TEKLA: What things ?
SPYROS: Learning , science love .
PASSIONATE: self-determination ! Those things that give Man dignity and independence .
MARMARA: But what of the Gods , who had protected and guided us so long ? They must breathe our prayers to survive . They hunger fo
SPYROS: as lions hunger for blood .
MARMARA: Spyros !
TO TEKLA: Your father 's mind is closed on these matters .
SPYROS: The Gods were desperate to claim our awe again .
TEKLA: Desperate the Gods ?
SPYROS: Yes , even the Gods . If they could not earn our faith with love , they would demand it with fear .
MARMARA: And that is how war broke out etween Man and Gods . ( turning to serve
PERSEUS: Now eat your dinner , which the Gods and your father have provided .
WILTING GIRL: It was not the boat I was watching .
PERSEUS: Can I be of service ?
WILTING GIRL: Yes , of service . I need you to come with me on a journey . Perseus gives her a look .
PERSEUS: Right now ? It would n't take much persuading to get me to leave this village , ut tonight is impossible . My family ca n't wake and find me gone . Where do you want me to go ?
WILTING GIRL: It 's not what I want . I am in the service of others .
PERSEUS: Come back in the morning and we can talk about it .
WILTING GIRL: I 'm sorry .
PERSEUS: For what ?
PERSEUS: How long have I been out ?
WILTING GIRL: This time ? Only a few hours . The time before , almost a day . How was your rest ?
PERSEUS: I had a dream . I fell into a dark pit . I thought I would never stop falling . But a beam of light formed a soft net , caught me and tossed me back . TheWilting Girl watches him .
PERSEUS' POV: The Wilting Girl listens to his story .
PERSEUS: When I could hear her , she spoke nonsense . She said that my fathe was a God and my mother a
PERSEUS' FACE: as he realizes she is his vision .
WILTING GIRL: You are special , Perseus . You irth was ordained for this very purpose .
PERSEUS: I am an ordinary man .
WILTING GIRL: Do you ever lie awake during a storm and listen to the thunder ?
WILTING GIRL: How long can you hold your breath ? Longer than the others ? Are there times when you know you should feel pain , but you do n't ?
PERSEUS: None of that means anything .
WILTING GIRL: Look at your arms , Perseus .
PERSEUS: A good trick . You must be the demigod , not me .
"NO": I 'm a Chthonian .
PERSEUS: A Chthonian ?
WILTING GIRL: An Earth Goddess .
CONFUSION: The Gods have a caste system just as men do . The Olympians are ou nobility few but cosmic . The Chthonians are the peasants . Ou abode is this earth , and we exist as long as men worship us .
PERSEUS: And when none worship you ?
SOFTLY: We fade away .
PERSEUS: And demigods , where do they stand in your hierarchy ?
WILTING GIRL: Nowhere . Sorry .
PERSEUS: If demigods rank so low , why do you need me ?
WILTING GIRL: For a marriage .
PERSEUS: What !
WILTING GIRL: Zeus , God of Gods , has proposed a treaty to end the war . At the center is the marriage of a mortal with a demigod .
PERSEUS: Who , me ?
WILTING GIRL: Zeus himself has chosen you . A demigod may be less than a God , ut he 's more than a Man . One foot in Humanity , the other in Divinity . Your marriage will be a symbol of accord between ou aces .
PERSEUS: Forget it .
WILTING GIRL: Such a union could save millions of souls .
PERSEUS: And just who exactly am I supposed to marry ?
ANDROMEDA: Do you think you can manhandle a Princess this way ? As though she was hungry and needy as you , a mere servant ?
ANDROMEDA: very mistaken a woman of my station never be attracted They go at it again .
PESHET: Princess Princess !
A SQUEAL: Find another Princess .
PESHET: The Queen approaches !
CASSIOPEIA: Where is the Princess ?
PESHET: Is she not in her chambers , ma'am ?
CASSIOPEIA: She is not . You are expected to know her
LOUDLY: Tell the Princess should you find her her father and I want to see her at once .
PESHET: Princess , it 's the King as well !
ANDROMEDA: To please you , I would submit to such a marriage except I would ather die ; Please let me know you 're serious about this perverse plan so I can make arrangements to kill myself .
KEPHEUS: It will take more than half-a-God to handle her .
CASSIOPEIA: She 'll be a great ruler one day .
WILTING GIRL: You 're looking in the wrong direction .
PERSEUS: I do n't think so .
WILTING GIRL: Perhaps you should give some thought to your immediate future .
PERSEUS: That 's what I 'm doing .
WILTING GIRL: Maybe you should take anothe look
WILTING GIRL: All the goods , armies , and culture of Man 's dominion flow through this port . He who reigns in Joppa , rules the world .
PERSEUS: The war has badly scarred this place .
WILTING GIRL: It is the war you have the powe to end . He throws her an angry look , grim .
PERSEUS: Do n't joke about such things . I 'd e useless before such a huge esponsibility .
WILTING GIRL: Perhaps you would be
TO HERSELF: as you are now .
GOSPEL: 'Before the first dawn , the eyes of the Deep watched the earth . ' Bow down to the Goddess of Chaos or know despair , for Tiamat will ule the heavens and the earth .
PERSEUS: What are they celebrating ?
WILTING GIRL: You .
KEPHEUS: . before I am a king or a peacemaker , I am a father . Do you know what that means ?
PERSEUS: I 'm not sure , Your Highness . I did not know my father .
THROWN: Yes , well it means I had no desire for my little girl 's carefree springtime to be cut
SHORT: ( to Cassiopeia ,
IRRITABLY: What is she ?
EMBARRASSED: I 'm sure she 's preparing herself to make the best possible impression .
AGAIN: and all so she could be thrust into a momentous conflict of which she knows nothing at all .
PERSEUS: She 's not the only one , sir . I do n't know much about the events for which I 've been drafted .
KEPHEUS: ( disarmed , but tough
GUY: I take no comfort in that , young man . In fact , I find little to take comfort in here . You are a stranger from a distant place , and I am asked to entrust the welfare of my daughter to you .
PERSEUS: If you are not kind and patient with her , if any harm of any kind should come her way , I will have your head on a stake .
KEPHEUS: Is this amusing to you ?
PERSEUS: Not even a little , my lord . It 's just that I myself was waylaid snatched also , as you say , from my happy springtime
KEPHEUS: Does a truce in the war between Men and Gods not strike you as a higher purpose ?
PERSEUS: With all respect , I have neve seen a God . On my island , they 're no more than a story .
KEPHEUS: You will learn there is more to this universe than is found on your island .
TO CASSIOPEIA: This is supposed to be the son of a God , yet he doubts thei existence !
TO PERSEUS: They exist , young man . But if you doubt their power , I join you
ANGRY: Cassiopeia ! We have agreed such talk has no place in this palace .
DEFIANT: Have we ?
PERSEUS: I can only proceed based on what I have experienced , not on a faith I do not possess .
KEPHEUS: Where does a young person get such ideas ?
PERSEUS: Perhaps from my adopted father , sir . I admire him greatly , and he elieves in little he can not hold in his hand .
KEPHEUS: Is he a scholar ?
PERSEUS: No , Your Highness , a fisherman .
AMOUN: Porpoise You 've grown tall and strong since my departure .
PERSEUS: What are you doing here ?
AMOUN: I am honored to serve the King as an advisor . His Magi Strategos .
PERSEUS: From my village tutor to Magi Strategos What a path !
KEPHEUS: Where is Andromeda ? At the least , the two should meet before tomorrow 's ceremony
FREAKED: Tomorrow ? Is the wedding so soon ?
CASSIOPEIA: The wedding comes later . Tomorrow we will have the public announcement .
AMOUN: And a celebration of the treaty .
KEPHEUS: It seems our Andromeda has wandered away . Cassiopeia reacts , upset .
AMOUN: Perhaps the thought of her new life has made her frantic to enjoy the vestiges of her old one .
KEPHEUS: Perseus , if you 're to take the wild girl for a wife , this is a good time to start your training . Go into the city and retrieve her .
PERSEUS: How will I know her ?
CASSIOPEIA: She is unmistakable .
PERSEUS: I 'm a stranger here . Any hints ?
AMOUN: Follow the lights and the sound of profane music .
WILTING GIRL: Zeus ?
WILTING GIRL: My part is finished .
ANDROMEDA: Will you please give me some
ANDROMEDA: What did you say ?
PERSEUS: I said , 'Very beautiful . '
ANDROMEDA: Do you think just anyone can make intimate judgements on the royal family ?
PERSEUS: I meant the sunset .
ANDROMEDA: Do you always start a seduction with an insult ?
PERSEUS: I know nothing of seduction . I 'm a simple fisherman . My home is across that water .
ANDROMEDA: What brings you here ?
PERSEUS: To Joppa ? I was kidnapped .
ANDROMEDA: I mean here , tonight . He looks over at her a long moment .
PERSEUS: I 've come to see my future wife .
ANDROMEDA: It 's not personal . You 're not a ad-looking boy . I 'm too young . I do n't want to be married .
PERSEUS: Me either .
ANDROMEDA: Then why are you doing it ?
PERSEUS: No one asked me . And now that I 've met you , I do n't know if I can go through with it . It 's not personal . Seeing you makes it real . I think a man should make his own decisions . I wo n't be the pawn of a King or a God . She looks at him with new interest .
ANDROMEDA: Since we agree , it 's settled . No marriage .
PERSEUS: I do n't think it 's going to be that simple .
ANDROMEDA: That does n't mean we ca n't be friends . Get to know each other . I want to show you something .
PERSEUS: I 'm already lost .
ANDROMEDA: I 'll take care of you .
PERSEUS: ( looks around the
CHAMBER: I do n't suppose I could escape without your aid .
ANDROMEDA: Do you want to ?
PERSEUS: One of the most beautiful women I 've ever seen .
ANDROMEDA: Of course , you have n't been much in the world .
PERSEUS: True . Maybe a lot of girls look like you .
ANDROMEDA: Do n't you want to make love to your almost-wife ? Maybe we 'll find we 're not compatible .
PERSEUS: What if we find we 're very compat
ANDROMEDA: Is it true you 're a demigod ?
PERSEUS: It seems what everyone wants to elieve .
ANDROMEDA: I do n't see it . But let 's find out for sure
ANDROMEDA: You 're late .
PERSEUS: I did n't know how to get this outfit on .
ANDROMEDA: I want to thank you for seeing me home . I was so flushed with wine I ca n't recall much of the evening . Perseus half smiles and turns to the crowd .
PERSEUS: Me either .
ANDROMEDA: At what point do you plan to tell them we 're not getting married ?
PERSEUS: Tell who ?
ANDROMEDA: Them
CASSIOPEIA: I wo n't be long-winded . You all know I am a modest person , no matter my rank .
WITH EDGE: This is not a celebration of a etrothal ( as Kepheus is on
ALERT: not the celebration of the happiness of two parents , or of our good people .
CASSIOPEIA: This union represents new hope fo a lasting peace ! That is the only cause for celebration .
TIAMAT: You have blasphemed powers beyond understanding You , a stupid aying goat before the unfathomable galaxies . You dare put this frivolous , scrawny slut
FLINCHES: above the infinite Goddess of the Deep !
TIAMAT: Look upon the sublime and know your error . You 'll not blink . Tell me now , mortal , how bright your preening urchin shines ?
ANDROMEDA: your beloved , worthless Princessa . Andromeda GASPS . Shock everywhere .
TIAMAT: This is my will , Joppa . Desolation or sacrifice . Choose your penance . You can thank your . sickly , aged Queen .
KEPHEUS: Leviathan awakes
AMOUN: . All monsters of the sea are ut shadows of Leviathan the Kraken colossal , rapacious , and nigh indestructible .
KEPHEUS: My Queen lies near death . Am I now to choose between the survival of our state and the life of Andromeda , my only child ?
RAGING: Do you tell me only what you think I wish to hear !
REPHEUS: Impossible .
PERSEUS: No We need only the will to do it .
KEPHEUS: You spoke the words the monste is indestructible !
QUIETLY: How can that be ?
AMOUN: Perseus ! You had something you wanted to say to the King ?
PERSEUS: What ? No , Master Amoun . I 'm listening .
AMOUN: You 're 'listening ' ? We 're talking about the precious life of you etrothed . Perseus meets his gaze , confused .
PERSEUS: I 'm a newcomer here . I would not presume to tell these men
AMOUN: Exactly ! A newcomer with a fresh perspective . Share your thoughts with the King , your future father- in-law .
PERSEUS: I know that I am young and have not seen much of the world , but it seems to me that nothing is indestructible .
KEPHEUS: I thought this boy 's father was a God . How does a stranger walk unmolested into the Throne Room of the King ?
AMOUN: I sent for him , Lord . This good man raised Perseus from infancy . He will help him now .
KEPHEUS: Help him with what ?
SPYROS: With whatever is needed
PERSEUS: He will help me destroy Leviathan .
KEPHEUS: But how ? Perseus has no idea .
AMOUN: Majesty , we can seek the counsel of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia . They know the hidden ways of the Gods . If Leviathan can be slain , they 'll know how to do it .
PERSEUS: We have thirty days to find its weakness .
KEPHEUS: With what army ? I dare not weaken our forces when the city is about to be besieged .
PERSEUS: ( uncertain , glances
AT SPYROS: We 'll go alone .
CATCHING UP: Yes . Give us a map .
AMOUN: My King , with your permission
AMOUN: I 'll give you a map and much more . I 'll go with you and bring a small and of comrades to help you on your mission . We can leave at first light . Diokles , the map .
AMOUN: We head north on the Via Dahlia . If we can make it to the Disputed Territories MOVE IN ON the tip of Amoun 's pointer on the
PERSEUS: Amoun , it seems an odd coincidence you came into my life as tutor , so long ago , and now , once again you instruct me .
LAUGHS: No matter what you believe , Porpoise , some things are fated . I 've been looking forward to this journey for a long , long time .
SPYROS: Who would have thought we 'd be on a journey like this ? Two simple fishermen .
PERSEUS: I 'm afraid I 've dragged you into eal danger , Father , when I have little idea of what I 'm doing .
SPYROS: Living at the mercy of the sea so long has convinced me some adventures are unexpected and some dangers unavoidable . It 's all in your attitude .
PERSEUS: What 's our attitude about destroying Leviathan ?
SPYROS: The Kraken is just another big fish . Perseus smiles , but is not as sanguine .
TIAMAT: The demigod and his retinue are joined . They march for the counsel of the Norn Sisters , to seek the frailty of my Leviathan .
CONCERNED: The Sisters
TIAMAT: Yes . I beseech you , track the expedition .
SET: To plainly thwart them would etray our intentions and draw the wrath of Zeus and the others .
TIAMAT: That , we can not have . I merely suggest that the road to Skolothia is hazardous .
SET: I take your meaning . And you loyal brute , he is fixed upon the hunt ?
TIAMAT: Fear not , he is about and he will do his share of damage .
PESHET: You must sleep . Princessat You must take care of yourself .
ANDROMEDA: My father was ready to sacrifice me to the monster .
PESHET: I 'm sure that is not so .
ANDROMEDA: I saw it . I heard the words . My loving father , his beloved child . Only Perseus stayed his decision .
TEARS COME: And do you know the worst part , Peshet ? He was right . Peshet 's feline eyes widen . More LIGHTNING .
ANDROMEDA: The city is besieged , the people suffer .
PESHET: Go to sleep , my lady .
ANDROMEDA: Sleep ? Sleep will come soon enough for me , faithful one . In one month at the latest . The palace shakes with the ROLLING THUNDER .
PERSEUS: Joppa is pummelled by the Dark Goddess .
WITHOUT LOOKING: It will not stop . Tiamat knows no mercy .
PERSEUS: By what name may mortals call you ?
WILTING GIRL: I have no name .
PERSEUS: Who do your worshippers pray to ?
WILTING GIRL: I ca n't remember .
PERSEUS: Perhaps that is why they are falling in number ?
PERSEUS: I have to call you something
THINKING: Since we 're naming you on this oad , what about 'Via Dahlia ' ?
PERSEUS: That 's a pretty name . Wait , etter yet 'Vidalia ' ? How 's that 'Vidalia ' ? That 's more than pretty , beautiful really , just as you are .
WILTING GIRL: ( just loud enough to
HEAR: I do not object .
DRACO: More .
THEM: I 'll find some more .
ABAS: Commander , I 'll get some , too .
PERSEUS: Now is when an honorable man would turn around and walk away
DOESN'T MOVE: . but they say I am not really a man .
PERSEUS: Vidalia
SET: Hear me , my pet . Let my instructions be seared to you primal mind as natural law .
SET: You are starving . Your gut says you 'll soon perish . No earthly meat will still that hunger . What you need , what you ache for , is the flesh of a demigod !
DRACO: Pegassi , stallions of the Gods .
ICOS: Perseus . How long do you think you could stay on one of those ? Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look .
BOREAS: Do n't goad the boy , Icos . No Man can ride a Pegasus .
ICOS: Did not Bellerophon tame the Great White Pegasus ?
BOREAS: You 're right . But he was a demigod
EAGER: Then this will be a good way to find out just what I am .
DRACO: Stop it , rogues . One of our own has disappeared without a trace and all you can think is to cause mischief . What if Perseus is ucked to his death from a thousand feet up ?
BOREAS: Do n't worry , Commander , the boy wo n't even get on its back .
DRACO: Do n't do this . If we go back to camp right now , we can avoid trouble and keep our goal in sight . A true leader will not be distracted .
PERSEUS: I 'm not the leader , Draco , Amoun is . I 'm too young to start avoiding trouble .
BOREAS: I 'll collect him right now , Commander .
DRACO: Perseus , get out of there ! Icos , fetch the others .
ICOS: A Humbaba !
DRACO: Boreas !
AMOUN: No , Perseus !
VIDALIA: Get back !
VIDALIA: I ca n't reverse the powerful curse . But if the monster 's hungry , I can feed it .
TO DRACO: Now ! The belly ! Slash the belly !
VIDALIA: I should cast a spell upon you and leave you forever a stone upon this stream .
PERSEUS: I did n't beckon the Humbaba .
VIDALIA: You did , with your childish ecklessness , and Boreas has paid the price !
PERSEUS: The monster killed my friend . I could not contain my rage . But you , Goddess , are aloof from the emotions of Men . Vidalia 's eyes narrow , enraged .
VIDALIA: Yes , a tyrannical Goddess , who dares question your mad rush to annihilation .
PESHET: Where have you brought me ?
AGENOR: It 's okay Peshet tries to leave , but Agenor stops her .
FANTASOS: Do you know who I am , child ?
PESHET: You are the Priest of the Streets .
FANTASOS: That 's right . You know that the good common people of Joppa trust that I will look after thei welfare .
PESHET: Some do
FANTASOS: Do you love the people of Joppa , Peshet ? ( as she nods ,
FRIGHTENED: Do you want them to be destroyed y this awful curse ? ( as she shakes he
HEAD: No , of course not . You want what 's best for the people .
PESHET: I have always served the royal family .
FANTASOS: Yes , you have , good Peshet . And now you may be in a bette position than anyone to help the Princessa save the city .
PERSEUS: Master Amoun You knew about me , did n't you ? When you came to ou village ?
AMOUN: Your birth was written in the stars . I sought you out and took it as my cause to teach you .
PERSEUS: You chose a poor student . I have learned little and my mistakes cost dearly .
AMOUN: Understanding that is the first step toward knowledge .
AMOUN: You can honor Boreas by the way you act from this moment forward .
PERSEUS: I 'm no demigod , Tutor . I 'm not even much of a human .
AMOUN: It is not your choice . You are what you are . Amor fati , Perseus . 'Love thy fate . '
PERSEUS: I do not believe my fate is to be half a God . No demigod could feel as confused as I do tonight .
AMOUN: Concentrate on the task before you . All answers will come with that .
PERSEUS: Tell me of the Cleon Desert Legion .
AMOUN: A fierce group . Trained to fight Amoun 's DESCRIPTION CONTINUES as we
LOOKOUT: The Night Patrol returns on the Gorge Road !
TIAMAT: My loyal friend . it is beneath you to stalk this band of infidels one by one . Events demand more decisive action .
KALIBOS: Grorashnrd I to be ruler hodirs made whole sovfrenty kingdom mine
TIAMAT: Yes , Kalibos , the time is nigh when I restore you to you ightful form proud Acrisius . With me , your protector , on the throne of Olympos the violato Zeus deposed .
FANTASOS: How much are we meant to suffer ? Where is your mighty King ? Safely cloistered above the flood on the high ground , with the high- orn the privileged gentry !
AGENOR: No ! He makes his stand at his daughter 's chamber door ! We will show Kepheus we 're not sacrificial fodder . We will tremble the walls of his Basilica !
FANTASOS: Peshet , you 've come at the right time .
RESPONSE: Peshet , do you understand how important your part is ? She nods , horrified by her predicament .
AMOUN: You wanted to know about Djinn Raiders . Here they are .
DRACO: Look sharp . Watch your surround .
VIDALIA: The Alkali Lotus
SMILES: An army bivouac flying the flag of Joppa . Its the Cleon Legion .
DRACO: Where is everyone ?
SPYROS: Draco , tell me what this Everyone is standing perfectly still .
WHISPERING: Lotophagi . Lotus-eaters . We should leave now .
PERSEUS: I wo n't do anything rash . I 've learned my lesson .
VIDALIA: This time you must do something ash . We all must . Kalibos leans close to Perseus .
KALIBOS: Tosharicana demigod expulsotat Zeusl
PERSEUS: No Perseus .
AMOUN: Muster to me !
AMOUN: Come on ! You can pass through !
PERSEUS: Only humans
AMOUN: No ! It 's too late for her !
PERSEUS: Drop it , Amoun !
PERSEUS: Take the barrier down or I 'll go through it !
AMOUN: Have you learned nothing ? If you eak out now , we 're all at risk .
PERSEUS: I 've learned one thing fo certain !
DRACO: Let 's kill these freks !
SOOTHING: Okay sshh I 've got you .
PERSEUS: Vidalia we need to help them
VIDALIA: To save me , you risked everything your mission , your friends the fate of multitudes . Men need etter judgment in the one who is meant to lead them
VIDALIA: You should n't have risked you life for me . It is a waste to save me when I 'll be gone so soon . She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead .
PERSEUS: Where Where are we ? The
VIDALIA: In the Djinn caravan . They 're escorting us to the Skolothian order .
PERSEUS: But I thought the Djinn
DRACO: The Skolothians have suffered more than their share in this war . The Legions of the Gods have battered them .
SPYROS: It 's no wonder they shy away from all strangers .
AMOUN: Because of you . You 're the reason they saved us .
PERSEUS: Me ? I do n't understand .
AMOUN: Why do n't you ask him ?
PERSEUS: I thought they did n't speak .
AMOUN: They have no mouths . That does n't mean they do not speak .
PERSEUS: Tell me of them .
AMOUN: They 're witches in the form of Strix . Not a pleasant sight , a Strix . They have powerful magic and dreadful habits . Baby-eaters , among other things . But they owe me a favor . When the war broke out , they lent thei power to men against the Gods in exchange for infant sacrifice . Tiamat struck them blind for thei treachery . When they came fo help , I fashioned them an artificial eye , for their Second Sight .
PERSEUS: You made only one eye ?
AMOUN: ( pleased with his
FORESIGHT: Yes . They have to take turns . If they all could see at once , they would be invincible , which one can not risk in beings so grotesque .
SPYROS: Stay away from my boy !
PERSEUS: Spyros , he means me no harm .
SHAIKH SULEIMAN: Moi ne epos ae'prositi , mene daeva .
PERSEUS: You are praying to me ? There must e a mistake .
SHAIKH SULEIMAN: Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr .
PERSEUS: You honor my father ? You hono Spyros ?
SHAIKH SULEIMAN: Ho Zeus Patir Zeus
URD: Amoun So sorry to see you again .
AMOUN: Likewise , Urd . I seek you counsel .
SHRIEKING: You want us to tell you about Leviathan .
AMOUN: You know already of course .
VERDANDI: We know this the Kraken can not e defeated .
PIERCING: You 've wasted a journey . I trust it was not a taxing one .
AMOUN: Surely the beast from the sea has some weakness . You owe me this answer at least .
URD: The Sisters owe nothing to you o any Man !
VERDANDI: There 's something wrong with that one . I do n't like having him here .
SKULD: Let me take a look .
PERSEUS: Tell us what we want to know o your Eye has seen its last .
VERDANDI: You 've brought a thief into ou nest !
URD: A villain !
SKULD: Scum !
AMOUN: No , good Sisters the son of Zeus .
PERSEUS: Since you can not see , let me tell you what 's about to happen . I 'm about to throw this evil Eye to the rocks far below . I fear its journey will be a taxing one .
URD: We ca n't tell you . We do n't dare etray Tiamat again .
VERDANDI: She sees all ! Her touch is felt in every evil thing !
SKULD: A second offense and she will
PERSEUS: You do n't have to tell us the secret . But you will have to live as blind as she made you .
SKULD: No ! Give us the Eye and we 'll tell .
PERSEUS: Tell me first . If I like the answer , you get your Eye .
VERDANDI: We need the Eye to see the answer !
AMOUN: You know the answer sure as you already knew the question .
SKULD: Leviathan can be destroyed
VERDANDI: The beast has one weakness .
SPYROS: Tell us now ! The Strix are torn , frightened . Finally
URD: The stare of Medusa . No creature can look directly in her eyes and still survive .
AMOUN: They 're lying , Perseus .
PERSEUS: I believe them . Here 's your second sight .
SKULD: In Tartaros , beyond the frozen Tethys Sea . Only Charon 's ferry dare challenge the ice .
PERSEUS: How can she be slain ?
VERDANDI: With extraordinary cunning and unimaginable luck .
SKULD: And the proper tools . Explore ou cache of spoils . You may find such a tool . Perseus stares into the black entrance .
DRACO: Do n't go in there , Perseus . It 's a trap .
VERDANDI: No . We have guaranteed the rage of Tiamat with this revelation
SKULD: . we ask only that the young God mention our aid
URD: to his Father .
NODS: If ever I should meet him . ( turns toward the
VAULT: I need a light .
FIRST MATE: Captain , the storm is too great !
CAPTAIN: Joppa is under siege ! King Kepheus needs these supplies !
PERSEUS: Tell of the Gorgoneion .
AMOUN: The Rape of Medusa ?
THAD: With respect , Magi , do not recite that black tale . You 'll bring the sky down upon us .
SPYROS: Does a fairy tale frighten you , soldier ? Thad looks at him , sharply .
DRACO: Tell the story , sir . My men fea only one thing to let fear in their hearts .
AMOUN: Medusa was a tender young woman once a mortal creature of such are beauty as to tempt even the Gods . One night , on the road home , she caught the eye of the God of Deserts and Entropy Set the Void .
AMOUN: .. and cursed her with a hateful stare that petrifies to stone all that look upon her .
AMOUN: Charon 's ferry .
CHARON: Better stoke those fires , boys , it 's going to get cold soon .
VIDALIA: She 's got a tail and she 'll use it just like that . Perseus opens his eyes .
CLOSES EYES: You 're enjoying this too much .
VIDALIA: Good !
PERSEUS: I wish it , but I ca n't perceive the world that way .
VIDALIA: You can . You 're the son of a God .
PERSEUS: Nothing I have done has convinced me of that .
VIDALIA: You do not see yourself clearly yet . In time , your actions in crisis will sharpen your view .
PERSEUS: I 'm beginning to hear the wind . ( senses something ,
CONFUSED: Vidalia why are you afraid ?
PERSEUS: Wait
VIDALIA: You 've learned enough for now .
PERSEUS: What ?
SPYROS: Nothing .
PERSEUS: What do you see ?
SPYROS: A look I know well .
PERSEUS: From me ?
SPYROS: Never before .
PERSEUS: Then where ?
SPYROS: In my own mirror , son .
PERSEUS: When does it go away ?
SPYROS: If we 're lucky never .
SHAIKH SULEIMAN: Jaggous temploi Tartaros de Gorgoneion maitress .
AMOUN: The Temple of Tartaros Medusa 's lair .
AMOUN: Medusa must have turned them to stone .
PERSEUS: I 'm going into the Temple .
DRACO: I am with you .
STEPS FORWARD: I go with my boy .
DRACO: Are you afraid ?
PERSEUS: Of what ?
DRACO: Good boy .
PERSEUS: Yes . You ?
NODS: Stay close and I 'll steer us through .
DRACO: I hear her , Perseus . She 's near !
KEPHEUS: The relief fleet is lost . Monsters gather outside our walls . Soon I wo n't be able to keep my own people at bay . And still , no word from the Expedition .
GENERAL ANDOR: Our forces prepare . We have cards yet to play . We 'll buy the time we need until
KEPHEUS: Until the Expedition perhaps eturns ? Until we 're saved by the fisherman 's son ?
SKEPTICAL: From your lips , I pray , to his true father 's ear .
ANDROMEDA: I would speak with the King in private .
ANDROMEDA: We can speak here , in the elements our subjects endure .
KEPHEUS: They take refuge from the Lowe Wharf . A sight I wish you 'd neve seen .
ANDROMEDA: You 've sheltered me too long from the hard things in this world .
KEPHEUS: I would have it no other way .
ANDROMEDA: And I thank you for the gift of my cosseted youth . But now , with Mother so It 's time I shared this burden you 've carried so long .
KEPHEUS: You make me proud , but you are only a child my little one .
ANDROMEDA: No , no longer . Your protection of me has brought hardship to ou people
ANDROMEDA: If you could end this siege with just one unselfish act , would you do it ?
KEPHEUS: To save my people , yes , of course .
ANDROMEDA: Such an act is within my power .
KEPH EUS: Stop itl I forbid you to entertain such thoughts .
ANDROMEDA: Perseus and the others were willing to give everything .
KEPHEUS: Listen to me . By the time this is over , your mother and I may well e gone . But I guarantee the day is coming when Joppa will know glory under Queen Andromeda .
ANDROMEDA: Be at peace , Father , I will not cause you any more sadness than I already have .
SPYROS: Eleven stadia to the South What is 'Polis of Jove Pater ' ? I 'm ignorant of this .
AMOUN: Jove the Father is another name by which Zeus was known . This milestone dates from when city states were named for their patron deities .
PERSEUS: Joppa .
AMOUN: Yes , Joppa once the most sacred site in the worship of Jove .
PERSEUS: Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to take hostage . ( as Amoun confirms
THIS: She compels the people to make human sacrifice of the Princess Andromeda
AMOUN: . and transforms Joppa into the new church of Tiamat . The ancient abode of Zeus
QUIETLY: becomes the new home of Tiamat , granting her sway to supplant him as the God of Gods . You ca n't allow Tiamat to rule Olympos .
PERSEUS: Father , we 've seen much on this journey we can not hold in ou hands . Yet these things are real enough . At each turn , we find monsters and Gods .
SPYROS: Yes , the evidence is everywhere once we leave our island . That 's why I so rarely leave . These Gods , what do you make of them ?
PERSEUS: As you always said , they 're petty , vengeful and dangerous .
SPYROS: Yes , as bad as men . And would you have that sort guide your life ?
PERSEUS: No . Men must be accountable to themselves . Otherwise we serve poor masters .
SPYROS: That 's my boy . Amoun rides up .
AMOUN: We should stop for the night .
PERSEUS: We must keep moving . Time is unning out .
SPYROS: If we do n't rest the horses , they wo n't make it to Joppa .
TO PERSEUS: We all need rest . If you do n't save yourself , you 'll have nothing left when you face the Kraken .
PERSEUS: Vidalia !
AMOUN: Why do n't we stop here tonight ? Spyros smiles , looking off after Perseus .
VIDALIA: I know this place
PERSEUS: Who were they ?
UNCERTAIN: I know they were humans . They seemed so fragile . I sheltered them because I thought the harsh world would break them . Now I know I underestimated them . Her eyes pierce Perseus .
VIDALIA: When I saw you come out with Medusa 's head , I saw that a Man had done an impossible thing . Beautiful , yes , but not fragile . Resilient . Fearless .
PERSEUS: I was mad with fear . I was no hero . I just did n't want to die . Perseus turns toward the altar .
VIDALIA: When the war began , Men ranged through the hills , stamping out any trace of God-worship they found . My true name was carved here . When it was obliterated , my worshippers lost faith and my last season began .
PERSEUS: How long do you have ?
VIDALIA: Only days .
PERSEUS: What will happen ?
VIDALIA: I will vanish , quick as dew evaporating at dawn .
PERSEUS: What about me ?
VIDALIA: Nothing can save me .
PERSEUS: I do n't believe that . Will love not buy another day , Vidalia ?
TEARS FLOWING: I was cut free of earthly longing . Why did you have to give me a name ?
PERSEUS: When you vanish , I 'll find you .
PERSEUS: I 'd rather look at you .
VIDALIA: Do what I tell you . I 'm going to give you a spell .
PERSEUS: Do n't give away your secrets . You still have need of them .
VIDALIA: Let me give you this sliver of magic . I 'll write it on you instinct . When the time comes , you 'll know how to use it .
TIAMAT: How did he do this ? They were not even to reach Medusa .
SET: Fate has begun to shift . The future ripples with uncertainty .
TIAMAT: Spare me your pitiful maundering ! There is no Fate beyond my actions and no uncertainty in the face of my will .
COWED: I meant only that the demigod ends the path without knowing it . He is ignorant of the rules , o unconcerned with them .
TIAMAT: Then there shall be no rules ! Prove to me you have not lost that which makes you most valuable . Set absorbs her tirade , stung .
SET: And Zeus the others ?
TIAMAT: I am your ally . That is all you need to know . Bloody your hands and rid me of this pestilence .
SET: You have liberated me , my Queen . Watch as your desires are quickly satisfied . Set disappears .
PERSEUS: Where is she ?
AMOUN: This is my fault . I 've permitted .this infatuation to progress too far .
PERSEUS: It is not yours to permit , Master with respect .
VIDALIA: Look what I 've found for us
TO VIDALIA: Have you forgotten Perseus is engaged to the Princessa ?
PERSEUS: I wo n't marry Andromeda .
AMOUN: If by some miracle you survive this encounter with Leviathan , the hand of the Princessa is you eward .
PERSEUS: I want no reward .
AMOUN: Are you so selfish ? Would you isk everything for the foolish love of
PERSEUS: I am half God and now is the time
VIDALIA: I 'm so sorry , Perseus .
IN AWE: You faced a God in lethal combat and vanquished him . Never have I heard of such a thing .
PERSEUS: We must go quickly now .
FANTASOS: We invoke thee , Queen of the Deep . We attend thee only to listen and obey .
FANTASOS: We serve your will so that we may e absorbed into you perfection Holy of holies Tiamat !
PESHET: My lady ? Princess Andromeda ?
ANDROMEDA: Peshet , stop ! I know what I am meant to do .
PESHET: My lady , please
ANDROMEDA: I was afraid , Peshet . Afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me .
PESHET: Princessa , give me your hand . Andromeda , please . Please .
ANDROMEDA: I 'm not afraid anymore . I will do what I must . I will die so that they may live .
PESHET: I wo n't allow it , my lady . Today , you are only a Princess . One day your people may need a Queen ready to die for them .
PESHET: Good .
ANDROMEDA: We must get to my mother and father . A VOICE from the darkness
AGENOR: The Princessa is coming with us . She has a rendezvous to keep .
PESHET: Come and get her .
AGENOR: Take the Princess alive !
PESHET: Run , Princess ! Save yourself . Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel .
SECOND REBEL: You 're not going anywhere , You Highness .
SPYROS: If it should come to pass , tell your mother and sister I loved them much .
PERSEUS: You 'll have to tell them yourself . Vidalia 's voice has become weaker .
VIDALIA: The people are frightened . But they can triumph.. They need only one thing .
PERSEUS: I will not fail them .
ANGUISHED: No . It 's too late . She 's disappeared .
INCANTATION: O Leviathan , firstborn of the Deep , accept this offering of mortal flesh for the exaltation of your Cosmic Mother .
SPYROS: The sacrifice has begun .
PERSEUS: I must get to the cliffs !
SPYROS: How ?
PERSEUS: May we all have a good ride today !
SPYROS: No shit .
TIAMAT: I damn you , Zeus ! You will hea my curses forever in the crash of
PERSEUS: Hello . ( as she smiles ,
RELIEVED: Are you all right ?
ANDROMEDA: I think I am .
PERSEUS: Are you ready to become a queen ?
ANDROMEDA: Yes . Yes , I am .
PERSEUS: Then you 're ready to go home .
ZEUS: Am I to understand you do not intend to make this union with the Queen Andromeda ?
PERSEUS: Yes .
ZEUS: Despite my will and intention that you do so ?
PERSEUS: Yes .
ZEUS: Would you choose to condemn Men , your own people , to suffer more of this devastating War ?
PERSEUS: I have no people . You have stranded me between realms , neither man nor God .
STERNLY: Do you reproach Zeus ?
PERSEUS: No . I thank you Father .
ZEUS: Does that absolve you suddenly of your responsibilities ?
PERSEUS: You 've made me understand that my esponsibility is to myself . So it is with us all .
ZEUS: What will you do , Man of free will ?
PERSEUS: I 'm going to find Vidalia .
ZEUS: So my Son , you will be a pawn for love ?
LAUGHS: Yes , Father , gladly .
FIGURE: HelloWhat ? No , I do n't work todayI 'm playing hockey at two . THE DOG yawns and shakes its head .
DANTE: Next time , I get the bed .
ACTIVIST: Do you mind if I drink this here ?
DANTE: Sure . Go ahead .
CUSTOMER: Are you open ?
DANTE: Yeah .
CUSTOMER: Pack of cigarettes .
ACTIVIST: Are you sure ?
CUSTOMER: Am I sure ?
ACTIVIST: Are you sure ?
CUSTOMER: Am I sure about what ?
ACTIVIST: Do you really want to buy those cigarettes ?
CUSTOMER: Are you serious ?
ACTIVIST: How long have you been smoking ?
CUSTOMER: What is this , a poll ?
DANTE: Beats me .
ACTIVIST: How long have you been a smoker ?
CUSTOMER: Since I was thirteen .
ACTIVIST: I 'd say you 're about nineteen , twenty , am I right ?
CUSTOMER: What the hell is that ?
ACTIVIST: That 's your lung . By this time , your lung looks like this .
CUSTOMER: You 're shittin ' me .
ACTIVIST: You think I 'm shitting you
CUSTOMER: What 's this ?
ACTIVIST: It 's a trach ring . It 's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box . This one came out of a sixty-year-old man .
CUSTOMER: Unnhh !
ACTIVIST: He smoked until the day he died . Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way .
DANTE: Excuse me , but
ACTIVIST: This is where you 're heading . A cruddy lung , smoking through a hole in your throat . Do you really want that ?
CUSTOMER: Well , if it 's already too late
ACTIVIST: It 's never too late . Give those cigarettes back now , and buy some gum instead . Here . Chewlies Gum . Try this .
CUSTOMER: It 's not the same .
ACTIVIST: It 's cheaper than cigarettes . And it certainly beats this . Hands him a picture .
CUSTOMER: Jesus !
ACTIVIST: It 's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung . Keep it .
CUSTOMER: I 'll just take the gum .
DANTE: Fifty-five .
ACTIVIST: You 've made a wise choice . Keep up the good work . The CUSTOMER exits .
DANTE: Maybe you should take that coffee outside .
ACTIVIST: No , I think I 'll drink it in here , thanks .
DANTE: If you 're going to drink it in here , I 'd appreciate it if you 'd not bother the customers .
ACTIVIST: Okay . I 'm sorry about that . Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter .
CUSTOMER: Pack of cigarettes . What 's that ?
ACTIVIST: This ? How long have you been smoking ?
JAY: WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS ! YEAH !
GUY: You selling ?
JAY: I got hits , hash , weed , and late on I 'll have 'shrooms . We take cash , or stolen MasterCard and Visa .
ACTIVIST: You 're spending what ? Twenty , thirty dollars a week on cigarettes .
LISTENER 1: Forty .
LISTENER 2: Fifty-three .
ACTIVIST: Fifty-three dollars . Would you pay someone that much money every week to kill you ? Because that 's what you 're doing now , by paying for the so-called privilege to smoke !
LISTENER 3: We all got ta go sometime
ACTIVIST: It 's that kind of mentality that allows this cancer-producing industry to thrive . Of course we 're all going to die someday , but do we have to pay for it ? Do we have to actually throw hard-earned dollars on a counter and say , `` Please , please , Mister Merchant of Death , sir ; please sell me something that will give me bad breath , stink up my clothes , and fry my lungs . ''
LISTENER 1: It 's not that easy to quit .
ACTIVIST: Of course it 's not ; not when you have people like this mindless cretin so happy and willing to sell you nails for your coffin !
DANTE: Hey , now wait a sec
ACTIVIST: Now he 's going to launch into his ap about how he 's just doing his job ; following orders .
DANTE: I think you 'd better leave now .
ACTIVIST: You want me to leave ? Why ? Because somebody is telling it like it is ? Somebody 's giving these fine people a wake-up call ? !
DANTE: You 're loitering in here , and causing a disturbance .
ACTIVIST: You 're the disturbance , pal ! And here I 'm buying somewhat 's this ? Chewlie 's Gum . There . I 'm no longer loitering . I 'm a customer , a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers .
LISTENER 2: Yeah , now shut up so he can speak !
ACTIVIST: Oh , he 's scared now ! He sees the threat we present ! He smells the changes coming , and the loss of sales when the nonsmokers finally demand satisfaction . We demand the ight to breathe cleaner air !
LISTENER 3: Yeah !
ACTIVIST: We 'd rather chew our gum than embrace slow death ! Let 's abolish this heinous practice of sucking poison , and if it means ruffling the feathers of a convenience store idiot , then so be it !
DANTE: That 's it , everybody out .
ACTIVIST: We 're not moving ! We have a right , a constitutional right , to assemble and be heard !
DANTE: Yeah , but not in here .
ACTIVIST: What better place than this ? To stamp it out , you got ta start at the source !
DANTE: Like I 'm responsible for all the smokers !
ACTIVIST: The ones in this town , yes ! You encourage their growth , their habit . You 're the source in this area , and we 're going to shut you down fo good ! For good , cancer-merchant !
CROWD: Cancer merchant ! Cancer merchant ! Cancer merchant !
VERONICA: Who 's leading this mob ?
SOMEONE: That guy .
VERONICA: Let 's see some credentials .
DANTE: Too hard ? ! I do n't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me !
VERONICA: At least they were n't lit .
DANTE: I hate this fucking place .
VERONICA: Then quit . You should be going to school anyway
DANTE: Please , Veronica . Last thing I need is a lecture at this point .
VERONICA: All I 'm saying is that if you 're unhappy you should leave .
DANTE: I 'm not even supposed to be here today !
VERONICA: I know . I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something .
DANTE: The guy got sick and could n't come in .
VERONICA: Do n't you have a hockey game at two ?
DANTE: Yes ! And I 'm going to play like shit because I did n't get a good night 's sleep !
VERONICA: Why did you agree to come in then ?
DANTE: I 'm only here until twelve , then I 'm gone . The boss is coming in .
VERONICA: Why do n't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here ?
DANTE: Somebody jammed the locks with gum .
VERONICA: You 're kidding .
DANTE: Bunch of savages in this town .
VERONICA: You look bushed . What time did you get to bed ?
DANTE: I do n't know-like two-thirty , three .
VERONICA: What were you doing up so late ?
DANTE: Hunhh ? Nothing .
VERONICA: What were you doing ?
DANTE: Nothing ! Jesus ! I got ta fight with you now ?
VERONICA: Who 's fighting ? Why are you so defensive ?
DANTE: Who 's defensive ? JustWould you just hug me ? ! All right ? You oyfriend was accosted by an angry mob , and he needs to be hugged . She stares at him .
VERONICA: She called you , did n't she ?
DANTE: Oh , be real ! Would youWould you please hug me ? I just went through a very traumatic experience and I have n't been having the best day so far . Now come on . VERONICA stares at him .
VERONICA: How much money did you leave up there ?
DANTE: Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles . People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning .
VERONICA: You 're trusting .
DANTE: Why do you say that ?
VERONICA: How do you know they 're taking the ight amount of change ? Or even paying for what they take ?
DANTE: Theoretically , people see money on the counter and nobody around , they think they 're being watched .
VERONICA: Honesty through paranoia . Why do you smell like shoe polish ?
DANTE: I had to use shoe polish to make that sign . The smell wo n't come off .
VERONICA: Do you think anyone can see us down here ?
DANTE: Why ? You wan na have sex or something ?
VERONICA: Ooh ! Can we ? !
DANTE: Really ?
VERONICA: I was kidding .
DANTE: Yeah , right . You ca n't get enough of me .
VERONICA: Typically male point of view .
DANTE: How do you figure ?
VERONICA: You show some bedroom proficiency , and you think you 're gods . What about what we do for you ?
DANTE: Women ? Women , as lovers , are all asically the same they just have to be there .
VERONICA: `` Be there ? ''
DANTE: Making a male climax is not all that challenging insert somewhere close and preferably moist ; thrust ; epeat .
VERONICA: How flattering .
DANTE: Now , making a woman cumtherein lies a challenge .
VERONICA: Oh , you think so ?
DANTE: A girl makes a guy cum , it 's standard . A guy makes a girl cum , it 's talent .
VERONICA: And I actually date you ?
DANTE: Something wrong ?
VERONICA: I 'm insulted . Believe me , Don Juan , it takes more than that to get a guy off . Just `` being there '' -as you put it-is not enough .
DANTE: I touched a nerve .
VERONICA: I 'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life .
DANTE: It was n't directed at you . I was making a broad generalization .
VERONICA: You were making a generalization about `` broads ! ''
DANTE: These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me .
VERONICA: How many ?
DANTE: How many what ?
VERONICA: How many girls have you slept with ?
DANTE: How many different girls ? Did n't we already have this discussion once ?
VERONICA: We might have ; I do n't remember . How many ?
DANTE: Including you ?
VERONICA: It better be up to and including me .
DANTE: Twelve .
VERONICA: You 've slept with twelve different girls ?
DANTE: Including you ; yes . Pause . She slaps him .
VERONICA: You 're a pig .
DANTE: Why 'd you hit me ?
VERONICA: Do you know how many different men I 've had sex with ?
DANTE: Do I get to hit you after you tell me ?
VERONICA: Three .
DANTE: Three ?
VERONICA: Three including you .
DANTE: You 've only had sex with three different people ?
VERONICA: I 'm not the pig you are .
DANTE: Who ?
VERONICA: You !
DANTE: No ; who were the three , besides me ?
VERONICA: John Franson and Rob Stanslyk .
DANTE: Wow . That 's great . That 's something to be proud of .
VERONICA: I am . And that 's why you should feel like a pig . You men make me sick . You 'll sleep with anything that says yes .
DANTE: Animal , vegetable , or mineral .
VERONICA: Vegetable meaning paraplegic .
DANTE: They put up the least amount of struggle .
VERONICA: After dropping a bombshell like that , you owe me . Big .
DANTE: All right . Name it .
VERONICA: I want you to come with me on Monday .
DANTE: Where ?
VERONICA: To school . There 's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment .
DANTE: Ca n't we ever have a discussion without that coming up ?
VERONICA: It 's important to me , Dante . You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit . I wish you 'd go back to school .
DANTE: Jesus , would you stop ? You make my head hurt when you talk about this .
VERONICA: Unlike you , I have a class in forty-five minutes .
WILLAM: Ronnie ! How are you ? You work here now ?
VERONICA: No , I 'm just visiting my man . Dante , this is Willam Black . This is Dante Hicks , my boyfriend .
DANTE: How are you ? Just the soda ?
WILLAM: And a pack of cigarettes . Are you still going to Seton Hall ?
VERONICA: No , I transferred into Monmouth this year . I was tired of missing him .
WILLAM: Do you still talk to Sylvan ?
VERONICA: I just talked to her on Monday . We still hang out on weekends .
WILLAM: That 's cool . Well-you two lovebirds take it easy , all right ?
VERONICA: I will . Take it easy .
WILLAM: Bye .
VERONICA: Bye That was Snowball .
DANTE: Why do you call him that ?
VERONICA: Sylvan made it up . It 's a blow jo thing .
DANTE: What do you mean ?
VERONICA: After he gets a blow job , he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing . It 's called snowballing .
DANTE: He requested this ?
VERONICA: He gets off on it .
DANTE: Sylvan can be talked into anything .
VERONICA: Why do you say that ?
DANTE: Like you said-she snowballed him .
VERONICA: Sylvan ? No ; I snowballed him .
DANTE: Yeah , right .
VERONICA: I 'm serious
DANTE: You sucked that guy 's dick ?
VERONICA: Yeah . How do you think I know he liked
DANTE: Butbut you said you only had sex with three guys ! You never mentioned him !
VERONICA: That 's because I never had sex with him !
DANTE: You sucked his dick !
VERONICA: We went out a few times . We did n't have sex , but we fooled around .
DANTE: Oh my God ! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys ?
VERONICA: Because I did only sleep with three guys ! That does n't mean I did n't just go with people .
DANTE: Oh my God-I feel so nauseous
VERONICA: I 'm sorry , Dante . I thought you understood .
DANTE: I did understand ! I understand that you slept with three different guys , and that 's all you said .
VERONICA: Please calm down .
DANTE: How many ?
VERONICA: Dante
DANTE: How many dicks have you sucked ? !
VERONICA: Let it go
DANTE: HOW MANY ?
VERONICA: All right ! Shut up a second and I 'll tell you ! Jesus ! I did n't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked .
DANTE: This is different . This is important . How many ? !
VERONICA: Something like thirty-six .
DANTE: WHAT ? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX ?
VERONICA: Lower your voice !
DANTE: What the hell is that anyway , `` something like thirty-six ? '' Does that include me ?
VERONICA: Um . Thirty-seven .
DANTE: I 'M THIRTY-SEVEN ?
VERONICA: I 'm going to class .
DANTE: Thirty-seven ? ! My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks !
CUSTOMER: In a row ?
DANTE: Hey ! Where are you going ? !
VERONICA: Hey listen , jerk ! Until today you never even knew how many guys I 'd slept with , because you never even asked . And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls . Well , I never had sex with twelve different guys !
DANTE: No , but you sucked enough dick !
VERONICA: Yeah , I went down on a few guys
DANTE: A few ?
VERONICA: And one of those guys was you ! The last one , I might add , which-if you 're too stupid to comprehend- means that I 've been faithful to you since we met ! All the othe guys I went with before I met you , so , if you want to have a complex about it , go ahead ! But do n't look at me like I 'm the town whore , ecause you were plenty busy yourself , before you met me !
DANTE: Wellwhy did you have to suck their dicks ? Why did n't you just sleep with them , like any decent person ? !
VERONICA: Because going down it 's a big deal ! I used to like a guy , we 'd make out , and sooner or later I 'd go down on him . But I only had sex with the guys I loved .
DANTE: I feel sick .
VERONICA: I love you . Do n't feel sick .
DANTE: Every time I kiss you now I 'm going to taste thirty-six other guys . VERONICA violently lets go of him .
VERONICA: I 'm going to school . Maybe late you 'll be a bit more rational .
DANTE: Thirty-seven . I just ca n't
VERONICA: Goodbye , Dante .
DANTE: Try not to suck any more dicks on your way through the parking lot !
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: I thought that place was supposed to be opened at eleven o'clock ? It 's twenty after !
DANTE: I called his house twice already . He should be here soon .
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: It 's not like it 's a demanding job . I 'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV . The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping .
DANTE: I 'm sure he was n't sleeping .
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: You calling me a liar ?
DANTE: No ; he was probably just resting his eyes .
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: What the hell is that ? Resting his eyes ! It 's not like he 's some goddamned air traffic controller !
DANTE: Actually , that 's his night job .
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: Such a wiseass . But go ahead . Crack wise . That 's why you 're jockeying a egister in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day 's work . I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch . You make sure this gets back . The number 's eight-twelve-Wynarski . And I wanted to get a damn movie , too .
DANTE: If you 'll just tell me the title of your rental choice , I 'll have him hold it for you .
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: Do n't hurt yourself . I 'm going to Big Choice Video instead .
DANTE: You forgot your keys .
V.A. CUSTOMER: The guy ai n't here yet .
RANDAL: You 're kidding . It 's almost eleven- thirty !
V.A. CUSTOMER: I know . I 've been here since eleven .
RANDAL: Man ! I hate it when I ca n't rent videos !
V.A. CUSTOMER: I would 've went to Big Choice , but the tape I want is right there on the wall .
RANDAL: Which one ?
V.A. CUSTOMER: Dental School .
RANDAL: You came for that too ? That 's the movie I came for .
V.A. CUSTOMER: I have first dibs .
RANDAL: Says who ?
V.A. CUSTOMER: Says me . I 've been here for half an hour . I 'd call that first dibs .
RANDAL: Ai n't gon na happen , my friend . I 'm getting that tape .
V.A. CUSTOMER: Like hell you are !
RANDAL: I 'll bet you twenty bucks you do n't get to rent that tape .
V.A. CUSTOMER: Twenty bucks ?
RANDAL: Twenty bucks .
V.A. CUSTOMER: All right , asshole , you 're on .
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: You see a pair of keys lying around here somewhere ?
DANTE: You 're late .
RANDAL: What the hell are you doing here ? I thought you were playing hockey at one .
DANTE: The boss called . Arthur fell ill .
RANDAL: Why are the shutters closed ?
DANTE: Someone jammed gum in the locks .
RANDAL: Bunch of savages in this town .
DANTE: That 's what I said .
RANDAL: Shit , if I 'd known you were working , I would 've come even later .
DANTE: He assured me that he 'd be here by twelve .
RANDAL: What smells like shoe polish ?
DANTE: Go open the sore .
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: Hey-did you see a set of keys lying around here ?
RANDAL: No time for love , Doctor Jones !
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: Fucking kids .
RANDAL: Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees . He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday . I tore up his membership .
DANTE: Shocking abuse of authority .
RANDAL: I 'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class , especially since I rule . Is the Pelican flying ?
DANTE: Do n't screw with it . It makes us look suspicious .
RANDAL: I ca n't stand a voyeur . I 'll be back .
DANTE: You do n't want to know .
RANDAL: You called Caitlin again ?
DANTE: She called me .
RANDAL: Did you tell Veronica ?
DANTE: One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach , thanks .
RANDAL: What do you two fight about ?
DANTE: I guess it 's not really fighting . She just wants me to leave here , go ack to school , get some direction .
RANDAL: I 'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree .
DANTE: You win .
RANDAL: I 'm going to offer you some advice , my friend let the past be the past . Forget Caitlin Bree . You 've been with Veronica for how long now ?
DANTE: Seven months .
RANDAL: Chick 's nuts about you . How long did you date Caitlin ?
DANTE: Five years .
RANDAL: Chick only made you nuts . She cheated on you how many times ?
DANTE: Eight and a half .
RANDAL: Eight and a half ?
DANTE: Party at John K's-senior year . I get blitzed and pass out in his edroom . Caitlin comes in and dives all over me .
RANDAL: That 's cheating ?
DANTE: In the middle of it , she calls me Brad .
RANDAL: She called you Brad ?
DANTE: She called me Brad .
RANDAL: That 's not cheating . People say crazy shit during sex . One time , I called this girl `` Mom . ''
DANTE: I hit the lights and she freaks . Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson .
RANDAL: What do you mean ?
DANTE: She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom . She picked the wrong one . She had no idea I was even at the party .
RANDAL: Oh , my God .
DANTE: Great story , is n't it ?
RANDAL: That girl was vile to you .
DANTE: Interesting postscript to that story Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom ?
RANDAL: Your mother .
DANTE: Allan Harris .
RANDAL: Chess team Allan Harris ? !
DANTE: The two moved to Idaho togethe after graduation . They raise sheep .
RANDAL: That 's frightening .
DANTE: It takes different strokes to move the world .
RANDAL: In light of this lurid tale , I do n't see how you could even omanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles .
DANTE: Because there was a lot of good in our relationship .
RANDAL: Oh yeah .
DANTE: I 'm serious . Aside from the cheating , we were a great couple . That 's what high school 's all about-algebra , bad lunch , and infidelity .
RANDAL: You think things would be any different now ?
DANTE: They are . When she calls me now , she 's a different person-she 's frightened and vulnerable . She 's about to finish college and ente the real world . That 's got to be scary for anyone .
RANDAL: Oh shit , I 've got to place an order .
DANTE: I 'm talking to myself here .
RANDAL: No , no , I 'm listening . She 's leaving college , and ?
DANTE: and she 's looking to me fo support . And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level .
RANDAL: What about Veronica ?
DANTE: I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin .
RANDAL: Caitlin 's on the same wave-length ?
DANTE: I think it 's safe to say yes .
RANDAL: Then I think all four of you had etter sit down and talk it over .
DANTE: All four ?
RANDAL: You , Veronica , Caitlin and Caitlin 's fiancé .
MOTHER: Excuse me , but do you see videotapes ?
RANDAL: What were you looking for ?
MOTHER: It 's called Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup .
SMALL CHILD: Happy Scrappy !
RANDAL: I 'm on the phone with the distribution house now . Let me make sure they have it . What 's it called again ?
MOTHER: Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup .
SMALL CHILD: Happy Scrappy !
MOTHER: She loves the tape .
RANDAL: Obviously . Yes , hello ; this is R.S.T . Video calling . Customer number four- three-five-zero-two-nine . I 'd like to place an orderOkay
MOTHER: Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup .
RANDAL: And a copy of Happy Scrappy-The Hero PupOkay , thanks . Sixteen forty-nine . It 'll be here Monday . Silence . Then
SMALL CHILD: Cunt !
DANTE: Yes , I 'd like to check on a misprint in today 's editionToday 's editionIt says `` Bree to Wed Asian Design MajorNo , no ; everything 's spelled fine . I just wanted to know if the piece was a misprintI do n't know , like a typographical error or something
JAY: `` Not in me . '' That 's what she says . I got ta pull out and spank it to get it on . So I blow a nut on he elly , and I get out of there , just as my uncle walks in . It was such a close call . I tell you what , though , I do n't care if she is my cousin , I 'm gon na knock those boots again tonight . TWO GIRLS join them .
GIRL 1: Scumbag . What are you doing ?
JAY: Nothing . Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin .
GIRL 1: He 's your cousin ?
JAY: Check this out , he 's from Russia .
GIRL 1: No way .
JAY: I swear to God . Silent Bob , am I lying ? SILENT BOB shakes his head
GIRL 2: What part of Russia ?
JAY: I do n't fucking know . What am I , his biographer ? Olaf , what part of Russia are you from ? OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB .
SILENT BOB: Home .
OLAF: Moscow .
GIRL 1: He only speaks Russian ?
JAY: He knows some English , but he ca n't not speak it good like we do .
GIRL 2: Is he staying here ?
JAY: He 's moving to the big city next week . He wants to be a metal singer .
GIRL 1: No way !
JAY: Swear . Olaf , metal ! OLAF makes a metal face .
OLAF: Skrelnick .
JAY: That 's fucked up .
GIRL 1: What did he say ?
JAY: I do n't know , man . He 's a fucking character .
GIRL 2: He really wants to play metal ?
JAY: He 's got his own band in Moscow . It 's called `` Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans '' or something like that .
GIRL 1: That does n't sound metal .
JAY: You got ta hear him sing . Olaf , `` Berserker ! '' OLAF laughs and shakes his head .
GIRL 2: Does he sing in English or Russian ?
JAY: English . Come on , `` Berserker ! '' Girls think sexy .
OLAF: Da . Da .
JAY: He 's gon na sing it . This is too funny .
JAY: That 's fucking funny , man !
GIRL 1: Did he say `` making fuck ? ''
JAY: Wait , there 's more . Olaf sing
DANTE: You hold the counter and I 'll pull .
MAN: Usually I just turn the can upside down .
DANTE: Maybe we should soap your hand o something .
MAN: They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans , like they do with cigarettes .
DANTE: I think it 's coming now
MAN: Thanks . I thought I was gon na have to go to the hospital .
DANTE: I 'll throw this out . Precautionary measure .
MAN: It stings a little .
DANTE: A word of advice Sometimes it 's est to let those hard to reach chips go . DANTE steps behind the counter .
MAN: Thanks .
DANTE: Do you know that article is accurate ? Caitlin 's really getting married !
RANDAL: You know what I just watched ?
DANTE: Me pulling a can off some moron 's fist .
RANDAL: Return of the Jedi .
DANTE: Did n't you hear me ? Caitlin really is getting married .
RANDAL: Which did you like better Jedi o The Empire Strikes Back .
DANTE: Empire .
RANDAL: Blasphemy .
DANTE: Empire had the better ending Luke gets his hand cut off , and finds out Vader 's his father ; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett . It ends on such a down note . And that 's life-a series of down endings . All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets .
RANDAL: There was something else going on in Jedi . I never noticed it until today .
DANTE: What 's that ?
RANDAL: All right , Vader 's boss
DANTE: The Emperor .
RANDAL: Right , the Emperor . Now the Empero is kind of a spiritual figure , yes ?
DANTE: How do you mean ?
RANDAL: Well , he 's like the pope for the dark side of the Force . He 's a holy man ; a shaman , kind of , albeit an evil one .
DANTE: I guess .
RANDAL: Now , he 's in charge of the Empire . The Imperial government is unde his control . And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule .
DANTE: Yeah .
RANDAL: Then would n't that logically mean that it 's a theocracy ? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort , then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one ased on religion .
DANTE: It would stand to reason , yes .
RANDAL: Hence , the Empire was a fascist theocracy , and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution .
DANTE: More or less .
RANDAL: The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hea Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief .
DANTE: I think they were Catholics . A BLUE-COLLAR MAN half enters the door .
RANDAL: You know what else I noticed in Jedi ?
DANTE: There 's more ?
RANDAL: So they build another Death Star , ight ?
DANTE: Yeah .
RANDAL: Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational efore the Rebels destroyed it .
DANTE: Luke blew it up . Give credit where it 's due .
RANDAL: And the second one was still being uilt when they blew it up .
DANTE: Compliments of Lando Calrissian .
RANDAL: Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it . I could never put my finger on it-something just was n't right .
DANTE: And you figured it out ?
RANDAL: Well , the thing is , the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army-storm troopers , dignitaries- the only people onboard were Imperials .
DANTE: Basically .
RANDAL: So when they blew it up , no prob . Evil is punished .
DANTE: And the second time around ?
RANDAL: The second time around , it was n't even finished yet . They were still under construction .
DANTE: So ?
RANDAL: A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer . I 'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing plumbers , aluminum siders , roofers .
DANTE: Not just Imperials , is what you 're getting at .
RANDAL: Exactly . In order to get it built quickly and quietly they 'd hire anybody who could do the job . Do you think the average storm troope knows how to install a toilet main ? All they know is killing and white uniforms .
DANTE: All right , so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star , why are you uneasy with its destruction ?
RANDAL: All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with . All right , look-you 're a roofer , and some juicy government contract comes your way ; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract , which means all sorts of enefits . All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius .
RANDAL: The ending of Return of the Jedi .
DANTE: My friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels .
RANDAL: Like when ?
DANTE: Whose house was it ?
RANDAL: `` Babyface '' Bambino ? The gangster ?
DANTE: Based on personal politics .
RANDAL: No way !
WOMAN: Is that video store open or not ?
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: They say so much , but they neve tell you if it 's any good .
RANDAL: What .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: Are either of these any good ? RANDAL , as always , reads on .
RANDAL: I do n't watch movies .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: Well , have you heard anything about either of them ?
RANDAL: No . The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: You 've never heard anybody say anything about either movie ?
RANDAL: They suck .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: I just held up the same two movies . You 're not even paying attention .
RANDAL: No , I was n't .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: I do n't think your manager would appreciate
RANDAL: I do n't appreciate your ruse , ma'am .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: I beg your pardon !
RANDAL: Your ruse . Your cunning attempt to trick me .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: I only pointed out that you were n't paying any attention to what I was saying .
RANDAL: I hope it feels good .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: You hope what feels good ?
RANDAL: I hope it feels so good to be right . There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others , is there ?
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: Well this is the last time I eve ent here
RANDAL: You 'll be missed .
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: Screw you !
RANDAL: You 're not allowed to rent here anymore !
DANTE: Wait .
RANDAL: She 's in here ?
DANTE: This guy is going through all of the eggs . Look .
RANDAL: What 's he looking for ?
DANTE: He said he has to find a perfect dozen .
RANDAL: Perfect dozen .
DANTE: Each egg has to be perfect .
RANDAL: The quest is n't going well ?
DANTE: Obviously not . Look at all the cartons that did n't make the grade .
RANDAL: What did he say ?
DANTE: He said it was important to have standards . He said nobody has pride anymore .
RANDAL: It 's not like you laid the eggs yourself .
DANTE: I 'll give him five more minutes then I 'm calling the cops . I do n't need this , man . I 'm not even supposed to be here today . A SMOKER steps in .
SMOKER: Two packs of cigarettes .
RANDAL: ( still staring at the
ODD MAN: I 'm as puzzled as you .
SMOKER: I 've actually seen it before .
DANTE: You know him ?
SMOKER: No , I 've seen that behavior before . Looking for the perfect carton of eggs , right ?
RANDAL: Yeah . How 'd you know ?
SMOKER: I 'll bet you a million bucks that the guy 's a guidance counselor .
DANTE: Why do you say that ?
SMOKER: I was in the Food City last yea when the same thing happened , different guy though . Stock boy told me that the guy had been looking through the eggs for like half an hour , doing all sorts of endurance tests and shit . I ask the kid how come nobody called the manager , and he says it happens twice a week , sometimes more .
RANDAL: Get out of here .
SMOKER: I kid you not . They call it Shell Shock . Only happens with guidance counselors for some reason . The kid said they used to make a big deal about it , but there 's no point .
DANTE: Why guidance counselors ?
SMOKER: If your job served as little purpose as theirs , would n't you lose it , too ?
RANDAL: Come to think of it , my guidance counselor was kind of worthless .
SMOKER: See ? It 's important to have a jo that makes a difference , boys . That 's why I kill Chinamen for the ailroad .
LITTLE GIRL: Can I have a pack of cigarettes ?
DANTE: Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine ? Damn , that 's eerie .
RANDAL: You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour ?
DANTE: What 's a jizz-mopper ?
RANDAL: He 's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off .
DANTE: Nudie booth ?
RANDAL: Nudie booth . You 've never been in a nudie booth ?
DANTE: I guess not .
RANDAL: Oh , it 's great . You step into this little booth and there 's this window between you and this naked woman , and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks .
DANTE: What kind of show ?
RANDAL: Think of the weirdest , craziest shit you 'd like to see chicks do . These chicks do it all . They insert things into any opening in thei odyany opening . He 's led a very sheltered life .
DANTE: Can we talk about this later ?
RANDAL: The jizz-mopper 's job is to clean up the booths afterward , because practically everybody shoots a load against the window , and I do n't know if you know or not , but cum leaves streaks if you do n't clean it right away .
CUSTOMER: This is the last time I come to this place .
DANTE: Excuse me ?
CUSTOMER: Using filthy language in front of the customersyou should both get fired .
DANTE: We 're sorry , ma'am . We got a little carried away .
CUSTOMER: Well , I do n't know if sorry can make up for it . I found you emarks highly offensive .
RANDAL: Well , you think that 's offensive
DANTE: Ma'am , ma'am , I 'm sorry ! Please , wait a second , ma'am
RANDAL: Who cares ? That lady 's an asshole . Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight . This job would be great if it was n't for the fucking customers .
DANTE: I 'm gon na hear it tomorrow .
RANDAL: You got ta loosen up , my friend . You 'd feel a hell of a lot bette if you 'd rip into the occasional customer .
DANTE: What for ? They do n't bother me if I do n't bother them .
RANDAL: Liar ! Tell me there are n't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis .
DANTE: There are n't .
RANDAL: How can you lie like that ? Why do n't you vent ? Vent you frustration . Come on , who pisses you off ?
DANTE: It 's not really anyone per se , it 's more of separate groupings .
RANDAL: Let 's hear it .
DANTE: The milkmaids .
RANDAL: The milkmaids ?
RANDAL: You know who I can do without ? I could do without the people in the video store .
DANTE: Which ones ?
RANDAL: All of them .
FIRST: What would you get for a six-year- old boy who chronically wets his bed ?
SECOND: Do you have any new movies in ?
THIRD: Do you have that one with the guy who was in that movie that was out last year ?
RANDAL: And they never rent quality flicks ; they always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the ack . MONTAGE INSERT # 2/ '' Ooooh ! ''
FIRST: Ooooh ! Home Alone !
SECOND: Ooooh ! Hook !
THIRD: Ooooh ! Navy Seals !
FIRST: What do you mean there 's no ice ? You mean I 've got ta drink this coffee hot ? !
SECOND: How much ?
THIRD: Do you sell hubcaps ?
RANDAL: See ? You vented . Do n't you feel etter now ?
DANTE: No .
RANDAL: Why not ?
DANTE: Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married .
RANDAL: Jesus , you got a one-track mind . It 's always Caitlin , Caitlin , Caitlin
DANTE: Veronica !
VERONICA: What happened to home by twelve ?
DANTE: He still has n't shown up . Why are n't you in class ?
VERONICA: Lit 101 got canceled , so I stopped home and brought you some lunch .
DANTE: What is it ?
VERONICA: Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off . What do you think it is ? It 's lasagne .
DANTE: Really ? You 're the best .
VERONICA: I 'm glad you 've calmed down a bit . Hi , Randal .
DANTE: Shut up ! Yes , I 've calmed down , I 'm still not happy about it , but I 've been able to deal . RANDAL makes loud slurping noises from O.C .
VERONICA: You had to tell him .
DANTE: I had to tell someone . He put it into perspective .
VERONICA: What did he say ?
DANTE: At least he was n't thirty-six .
VERONICA: And that made you feel better ?
DANTE: And he said most of them are college guys , I 've never met or seen .
VERONICA: The ostrich syndrome if you do n't see it
DANTE: it is n't there . Yes .
VERONICA: Thank you for being rational .
DANTE: Thank you for the lasagne .
VERONICA: You could n't get these shutters open ?
DANTE: I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow .
VERONICA: Bummer , Well , I 've got ta head back for the one-thirty class .
DANTE: What time do you get finished ?
VERONICA: Eight . But I have a sorority meeting till nine , so I 'll be back efore you close . Can we go out and get some coffee ?
DANTE: Sure .
VERONICA: Good . I 'll see you when you close , then . Enjoy the lasagne .
RANDAL: All right , now if you 're really feeling dangerous tonight , then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent .
CUSTOMER: This does n't even have Burt Reynolds in it .
RANDAL: Hey , neither did ET ; but that was a great movie , right ? DANTE opens the door and leans in .
DANTE: Can you come next door ? I got ta make a phone call .
RANDAL: Smokey Three thumbs up , am I right ?
DANTE: The best Burtless movie ever made .
CUSTOMER: Awww , he 's so cute . What 's his name ?
RANDAL: Lenin 's Tomb . Dolly over to DANTE , on the phone .
DANTE: Hello , is Mr. Synder there ? This is DanteDid he say if he was on his way here ? HereThe convenience storeI know , but the other guy called out this morning and Mr .
RANDAL: Vermont ?
DANTE: Can you believe this ? !
RANDAL: He did n't mention it when he called you this morning ?
DANTE: Not a fucking word ! Slippery shit !
RANDAL: So , what-you 're stuck here all day ?
DANTE: FUCK !
RANDAL: Why 'd you apologize ?
DANTE: What ?
RANDAL: I heard you apologize . Why ? You have every right in the world to be mad .
DANTE: I know .
RANDAL: That seems to be the leitmotif in your life ; ever backing down .
DANTE: I do n't back down .
RANDAL: Yes , you do . You always back down . You assume blame that is n't yours , you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off , you uckle like a belt .
DANTE: You know what pisses me off the most ?
RANDAL: The fact that I 'm right about you uckling ?
DANTE: I 'm going to miss the game .
RANDAL: Because you buckled .
DANTE: Would you shut the hell up with that shit ? It 's not helping .
RANDAL: Do n't yell at me , pal .
DANTE: Sorry .
RANDAL: See ? There you go again .
DANTE: I ca n't believe I 'm going to miss the game !
RANDAL: At least we 're stuck here together .
DANTE: You 've got a customer . RANDAL walks away .
RANDAL: I 've got ta tell you , my friend this is one of the ballsiest moves I 've ever been privy to . I neve would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy .
DANTE: I told him I had a game today . It 's his own fault .
RANDAL: No argument here . Insubordination ules .
DANTE: I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to . SANFORD skates up and skids to a halt .
SANFORD: Dante , let me grab a Gatorade .
DANTE: If you grab a Gatorade , then everybody 's going to grab one .
SANFORD: So ?
DANTE: So ? So nobody 's going to want to pay for these Gatorades .
SANFORD: What do you care ? Hey , what smells like shoe polish ?
DANTE: I 've got a responsibility here . I ca n't let everybody grab free drinks .
SANFORD: What responsibility ? You 're closing the fucking store to play hockey .
RANDAL: He 's blunt , but he 's got a point .
DANTE: At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here .
SANFORD: All I 'm saying is if you 're going to be insubordinate , you should go the full nine and not pussy out when it comes to free refreshments .
RANDAL: He 's right . As if we 're suddenly gon na have a run on Gatorade .
SANFORD: Fuckin-A .
DANTE: All right . Jesus , you fuckers are pushy .
SANFORD: Hey man , I hear Caitlin 's marrying an Asian drum major .
RANDAL: Design major .
DANTE: Can we not talk about this ?
SANFORD: Fine by me . But you 're living in denial and suppressing rage . Dante said we can all drink free Gatorade . A laid-back hurrah is heard .
RANDAL: Are you gon na lock the store ?
DANTE: I do n't know . You going to lock the video store ?
RANDAL: Look who you 're asking here . How 're we gon na block off the street ?
DANTE: We 're not playing in the street .
RANDAL: Then where 're we gon na play ?
DANTE: Ready ?
CUSTOMER: When 's this period over ?
DANTE: If you can just wait a few more minutes .
CUSTOMER: Fuck that ! I 'm gon na break my crazy neck on this ladder !
DANTE: I 'll be right back . It 's almost over . He jumps back into the game .
CUSTOMER: What the fuck is this ? ! I want some service !
DANTE: Who are you to make assessments ?
CUSTOMER: I 'll assess all I want !
DANTE: Like you 're better !
CUSTOMER: I can whip your ass .
WOMAN: Is the convenience store open ?
DANTE: There 's a stick over there . You 're shooting against the goal .
SANFORD: There was the orange balland the orange ball . DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over .
DANTE: Are there any balls down there ? !
SANFORD: I thought Redding had like three alls !
DANTE: Nobody has another ball ?
SANFORD: Shit !
DANTE: We getwhattwelve minutes of game , and it 's over ? Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck ! ! I 'm not even supposed to be here today ! DANTE skates off .
SANFORD: We still get free Gatorade , right ?
OLD MAN: Be careful .
DANTE: I 'm trying .
OLD MAN: You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer .
DANTE: So I 'm told .
OLD MAN: I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living . In the circus .
DANTE: And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass ?
OLD MAN: No , he got hit by a bus .
DANTE: OhCan I help you ?
OLD MAN: Well , that depends . Do you have a athroom ?
DANTE: Umyeah , but it 's for employees only .
OLD MAN: I understand , but can I use it . I 'm not that young anymore , so I 'm kind ofyou knowincontinent .
DANTE: Uhsure . Go ahead . It 's back through the cooler .
OLD MAN: Thanks son . Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there ?
DANTE: The white kind .
OLD MAN: I 'm not asking about the color . I mean is it rough or cottony ?
DANTE: Actually , it is kind of rough .
OLD MAN: Rough , eh ? Oh , that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids . Say , would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there . I see you sell the soft stuff .
DANTE: Yeah , but
OLD MAN: Aw , c'mon boy . What 's the difference ? You said yourself the stuff that 's there now is rough .
DANTE: Yeah , okay . Go ahead .
OLD MAN: Thanks son , you 're a lifesaver .
DANTE: Jesusgo ahead .
OLD MAN: Thanks , young man . You 've got a heart of gold .
DANTE: You know , you probably could 've een home , already , in the time it 's taken you to get in there .
OLD MAN: Can I trouble you for one of those magazines ?
DANTE: I said go ahead .
OLD MAN: No , I mean the ones there . Behind the counter . DANTE glances over and reacts .
DANTE: The porno mags ?
OLD MAN: Yeah . I like the cartoons . They make me laugh . They draw the iggest titties .
DANTE: Here . Now leave me alone .
OLD MAN: Uh , can I have the other one . The one below this one . They show more in that one . DANTE makes the switch .
RANDAL: Helluva game !
DANTE: One ball ! ! They come all the way hereI close the damn storefo one ball !
RANDAL: Hockey 's hockey . At least we got to play .
DANTE: Randal , twelve minutes is not a game ! Jesus , it 's barely a warm-up !
RANDAL: Bitch , bitch , bitch . You want something to drink ?
DANTE: Gatorade . Pause . Then
RANDAL: You know what Sanford told me ?
DANTE: I still ca n't believe Caitlin 's getting married .
RANDAL: Julie Dwyer died .
DANTE: Yeah , right .
RANDAL: No , I 'm serious . DANTE is visibly taken aback .
DANTE: Oh , my god .
RANDAL: Sanford 's brother dates her cousin . He found out this morning .
DANTE: How ? When ?
RANDAL: Embolism in her brain . Yesterday .
DANTE: Jesus .
RANDAL: She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened . Died midbackstroke .
DANTE: I have n't seen her in almost two years .
RANDAL: Correct me if I 'm wrong , but was n't she one of the illustrious twelve ?
DANTE: Number six .
RANDAL: You 've had sex with a dead person .
DANTE: I 'm gon na go to her wake .
RANDAL: No , you 're not .
DANTE: Why not ?
RANDAL: It 's today .
DANTE: What ! ?
RANDAL: Paulsen 's Funeral Parlor . The next show is at four .
DANTE: Shit . What about tomorrow ?
RANDAL: One night only . She 's buried in the morning .
DANTE: You 've got ta watch the store . I have to go to this .
RANDAL: Wait , wait , wait . Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well ?
DANTE: You hardly knew her !
RANDAL: True , but do you know how many people are going to be there ? All of our old classmates , to say the least .
DANTE: Stop it . This is beneath even you .
RANDAL: I 'm not missing what 's probably going to be the social event of the season .
DANTE: You hate people .
RANDAL: But I love gatherings . Is n't it ironic ?
DANTE: Do n't be an asshole . Somebody has to stay with the store .
RANDAL: If you go , I go .
DANTE: She meant nothing to you !
RANDAL: She meant nothing to you eithe until I told you she died .
DANTE: I 'm not taking you to this funeral .
RANDAL: I 'm going with you .
DANTE: I ca n't close the store .
RANDAL: You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof !
DANTE: Exactly , which means I ca n't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake .
RANDAL: You were saying ?
DANTE: Thanks for putting me in a tough spot . You 're a good friend . Silence . Then
RANDAL: She was pretty young , hunhh ?
DANTE: Twenty-two ; same as us .
RANDAL: An embolism in a pool .
DANTE: An embarrassing way to die .
RANDAL: That 's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died .
DANTE: How 'd he die ?
RANDAL: Broke his neck .
DANTE: That 's embarrassing ?
RANDAL: He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick . Absolute silence . Then
DANTE: Shut the hell up .
RANDAL: Bible truth .
DANTE: Stop it .
RANDAL: I swear .
DANTE: Oh , my god .
RANDAL: Come on . Have n't you ever tried to suck your own dick ?
DANTE: No !
RANDAL: Yeah sure . You 're so repressed .
DANTE: Because I never tried to suck my own dick ?
RANDAL: No , because you wo n't admit to it . As if a guy 's a fucking pervert ecause he tries to go down on himself . You 're as curious as the est of us , pal . You 've tried it .
DANTE: Who found him ?
RANDAL: My cousin ? My aunt found him . On his bed , doubled over himself with his legs on top . Dick in his mouth . My aunt freaked out . It was a mess .
DANTE: His dick was in his mouth ?
RANDAL: Balls resting on his lips .
DANTE: He made it , hunhh ?
RANDAL: Yeah , but at what a price . Silence . Then
DANTE: I could never reach .
RANDAL: Reach what ?
DANTE: You know .
RANDAL: What , your dick ?
DANTE: Yeah . Like you said , you know . I guess everyone tries it , sooner of later .
RANDAL: I never tried it . DANTE glares at RANDAL . Silence . Then
DANTE: I know it was a bad idea to close the store .
RANDAL: Listen to you .
DANTE: I ca n't help it . At least when we were playing hockey outside , I could see if anyone wanted to go in .
RANDAL: Nobody 's there . It 's four o'clock on a Saturday . How many people eve come to the store at four on a Saturday ?
DANTE: I ca n't fucking believe you ! !
RANDAL: I 'm telling you , it was n't my fault !
DANTE: You knocked the fucking casket over , for Chrissakes !
RANDAL: I was just leaning on it ! It was an accident !
DANTE: Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose ?
RANDAL: So the casket fell over ! Big deal !
DANTE: Her fucking body fell out !
RANDAL: So they 'll put her back in ! It 's not like it 's gon na matter if she eaks something !
DANTE: Justgo ! Go open the video store .
RANDAL: Shut the fuck up , junkie !
DANTE: Go open the video store .
JAY: Yeah , you cock-smoking clerk .
DANTE: How many times I got ta tell you not to deal outside the store .
JAY: I 'm not dealing . A KID tugs at JAY 'S shirt .
KID: You got anything , man ?
JAY: Yeah , what do you want ?
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: Hey , did you see a set of keys lying around here somewhere ?
RANDAL: Let me borrow your car .
DANTE: I do n't want to talk to you .
RANDAL: Fine . Just lend me your car .
DANTE: Why should I loan you my car ?
RANDAL: I want to rent a movie .
DANTE: You want to rent a movie . DANTE walks away , shaking his head .
RANDAL: What 's that for ?
DANTE: You work in a video store ! They head back to the counter .
RANDAL: I work in a shitty video store . I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie .
CUSTOMER: Are you open ?
RANDAL: Annoying Customer .
DANTE: Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time ?
RANDAL: Let me borrow your car .
DANTE: May I be blunt with you ?
RANDAL: If you must .
DANTE: We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video , espectively . As such , we have certain responsibilities which- though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning ou posts until closing .
RANDAL: I see . So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure .
DANTE: There 's a difference . Those were obligations . Obligations that could not have been met at any later date . Now renting videos-that 's just gratuitous , not to mention illogical , considering you work in a video store . Another CUSTOMER leans in .
CUSTOMER: Are you open ?
DANTE: Yes .
RANDAL: You know what ? I do n't think I care for you rationale .
DANTE: It 's going to have to do for now , considering that it 's my car that 's up for request . Can I help you ?
CUSTOMER: Pack of cigarettes .
RANDAL: What 's your point ?
DANTE: My point is that you 're a clerk , paid to do a job . You ca n't just do anything you want while you 're working .
CUSTOMER: `` Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner ; Reports Stock Increase . '' They print any kind of shit in these papers .
DANTE: They certainly do . Two fifty-five .
RANDAL: So your argument is that title dictates behavior ?
DANTE: What ?
RANDAL: The reasons you wo n't let me borrow your care is because I have a title and a job description , and I 'm supposed to follow it , right ?
DANTE: Exactly .
CUSTOMER: I saw one , one time , that said the world was ending the next week .
RANDAL: So I 'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I 'm here at work than , say , the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia ?
DANTE: That 's stretching it . You 're not eing asked to slay children o anything .
RANDAL: Not yet .
CUSTOMER: And I remember this one time the damn paper said
DANTE: Sir ! Sir , I 'm sorry ! He did n't mean it ! He was trying to get me .
CUSTOMER: Well , he missed !
DANTE: I know . I 'm sorry . Let me refund your cigarette money , and we 'll call it even .
CUSTOMER: This is the last time I ever come here . And if I ever see you again , I 'm gon na break your fucking head open !
DANTE: What the fuck did you do that for ?
RANDAL: Two reasons one , I hate when the people ca n't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines .
DANTE: Jesus !
RANDAL: And two , to make a point title does not dictate behavior .
DANTE: What ?
RANDAL: If title dictated my behavior , as a clerk serving the public , I would n't e allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy . But I did , so my point is that people dictate thei own behavior . Hence , even though I 'm a clerk in this video store , I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice . Agreed ?
DANTE: You 're a danger to both the dead and the living .
RANDAL: I like to think I 'm a master of my own destiny .
DANTE: Please , get the hell out of here .
RANDAL: I know I 'm your hero . RANDAL exits .
TRAINER: Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym .
DANTE: Excuse me ?
TRAINER: I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag . That milk only weighs about seven pounds .
DANTE: I did n't strain . I sighed .
TRAINER: I do n't think so . That was a grunt ; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles . I 'm a trainer . I know what that sound signifies you 're out of shape .
DANTE: I do n't think so .
TRAINER: Oh , I do . You made the same noise when you reached across the counte for my cash . Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized .
DANTE: They are not .
TRAINER: Yes , they are . You 're out of shape .
DANTE: What are you talking about ? There 's no fat on this body .
TRAINER: No fat , but no tone either . You do n't get enough exercise .
HEATHER: Are you open ?
DANTE: Yes .
HEATHER: Just the paper .
DANTE: Thirty-fire .
TRAINER: Let me ask you a question Do you think this guy 's out of shape ?
HEATHER: I do n't know . I ca n't really tell from here .
TRAINER: He is .
DANTE: I am not .
TRAINER: How much can you bench ?
DANTE: I do n't know .
HEATHER: I 'd say about sixty , seventy-tops .
DANTE: I know I can bench more than that !
TRAINER: I think the lady called it .
HEATHER: My ex-boyfriend was about his height , but he was much bulkier . He could bench two-fifty , three hundred easy .
TRAINER: I do about three-fifty , four .
HEATHER: No way !
TRAINER: Feel that .
HEATHER: That 's tight . Solid .
TRAINER: Now feel his . Roll up your sleeve , chief .
DANTE: Oh for God 's sake !
TRAINER: See ? You 're ashamed . You know you 're out of shape . Take my card . I can help you tone that body up in no time . Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program .
SUITED MAN: You open ?
DANTE: Yes . I 'm not out of shape .
SUITED MAN: Excuse me , but have you been here all day ?
DANTE: What ?
HEATHER: He 's got those love handles .
DANTE: I do n't have love handles .
SUITED MAN: Were you working here at about fou o'clock ?
DANTE: I 've been here since six o'clock this morning . Why ?
TRAINER: It 's probably from being around all this food every day .
HEATHER: Oh , I know . If I had to work here all day , I 'd be bloated and out of shape , too .
DANTE: I 'm not out of shape !
SUITED MAN: Can I have your name please ?
DANTE: Dante Hicks . Why ? What is this about ? The SUITED MAN scribbles in his notebook .
HEATHER: You 're Dante Hicks ? Oh my God ! I did n't even recognize you !
TRAINER: Because he 's out of shape .
DANTE: Do I know you ?
HEATHER: You remember Alyssa Jones ? She hung out with
DANTE: Caitlin Bree . Yeah ?
HEATHER: I 'm her sister .
DANTE: You 're Alyssa 's sister ? Heather ?
HEATHER: Yep . I remember you got caught in my parents ' room with Caitlin once .
TRAINER: Did you say Caitlin Bree ?
DANTE: Yeah .
TRAINER: Pretty girl , about this girl 's height-dark hair-gorgeous body ?
DANTE: Yeah ?
TRAINER: And your name is Dante Hicks ? You went to high school with her ? You played hockey ?
DANTE: How do you know that ?
TRAINER: Oh man ! Hey , you still going out with her ?
DANTE: No , she 's getting married .
TRAINER: To you ?
HEATHER: To an Asian design major .
TRAINER: Shit ! Do n't take this the wrong way , but I used to fuck her .
DANTE: What ?
TRAINER: While you two were dating in high school . We 're talking four , five years ago , back when I drove a Trans-Am .
HEATHER: Oh my God ! You 're Rick Derris ?
TRAINER: Yeah !
DANTE: You know him ?
HEATHER: Caitlin used to talk about him all the time .
TRAINER: Really ?
HEATHER: Oh yeah . You were the built olde guy with the black Trans and the ig
DANTE: Wait a second ! You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree ? While I was dating her ?
TRAINER: All the time . That girl was like a abbit .
DANTE: II do n't believe this
HEATHER: I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room .
DANTE: THE GLADES MOTEL ?
TRAINER: Holy shit ! She told you about that ! Buddy of mine worked there . Said he watched the whole thing . They used to film people at that hotel ; nobody knew about it .
HEATHER: She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm .
DANTE: What ? When ? When did all this shit happen ?
TRAINER: Hey man , that was a long time ago . Do n't let it get to you .
HEATHER: I 'm surprised you never found out about it , Dante . Everybody in school knew-even in my class .
DANTE: Jesus Christ , what next ?
SUITED MAN: Here you go .
DANTE: What 's this ?
SUITED MAN: A fine , for five hundred dollars .
DANTE: WHAT ?
TRAINER: Five hundred bucks ? What for ?
SUITED MAN: For violation of New Jersey Statute Section Two A , number one-seventy slash fifty-one Any person who sells or makes available tobacco o tobacco-related products to persons under the age of eighteen is egarded as disorderly .
DANTE: What are you talking about ?
SUITED MAN: According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code , section eighteen , five , slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor .
DANTE: I did n't do that !
SUITED MAN: You said you were here all day ?
DANTE: Yeah , but I did n't sell cigarettes to any kids !
SUITED MAN: An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock . Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health , and they send me down here to issue a fine . You say you were working all day , hence the fine is yours . It 's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child .
DANTE: But I did n't sell cigarettes to any kid !
TRAINER: To a five-year-old kid ? What a scumbag !
HEATHER: That 's sick , Dante .
DANTE: I did n't sell cigarettes to any kids ! I swear !
SUITED MAN: The due date is on the bottom . This summons can not be contested in any court of law . Failure to remit efore the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence , and a warrant will be issued fo your arrest . Have a nice day .
DANTE: But I did n't sell cigarettes to any kids ! Hey !
TRAINER: Forget it . I do n't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old . Can I offer you a ride somewhere ?
HEATHER: Sure . How about the beach ?
TRAINER: I like the way you think .
DANTE: Jesus ! What next ?
JAY: That 's the price , my brother .
JOHN: Yo , I do n't have that kind of cash .
JAY: For this kind of hash , you need that kind of cash .
JOHN: How long you gon na be here ?
JAY: Till ten . Then I 'm going to John K 's party .
JOHN: You 're gon na be at John K 's party ?
JAY: My man is deaf .
JOHN: Yo , do n't sell all that . 'Cause I 'm gon na get the cash and buy it from you at John K 's . You 're gon na bring it , right ?
JAY: The only place I do n't bring my drugs is church . And that ai n't till Sunday morning .
JOHN: Yo . I 'll see you at that party . I 'll see you there ?
JAY: I 'll see you there . JOHN leaves . JAY turns to SILENT BOB .
DANTE: When did you get back ?
CAITLIN: Just now .
DANTE: My God . I have n't seen you since
CAITLIN: Dante . You 've got a customer .
DANTE: Let 's not talk about that . How 'd you get home ?
CAITLIN: Train . It took eight hours .
DANTE: I ca n't believe you 're here . Another customer comes to the counter .
CUSTOMER: Excuse me , do you have
DANTE: To the back , above the oil . How long are you staying ?
CAITLIN: Until Monday . Then I have to take the train back . Yet another customer comes to the counter .
CUSTOMER: Pack of cigarettes . Congratulations . I saw that announcement in today 's paper . She 's marrying an Asian design major .
DANTE: So I 'm told .
JAY: Man , it 's fucking slow .
CAITLIN: You 're just going to lock the store like that ?
DANTE: I want to talk to you about something , and I do n't want to be disturbed .
CAITLIN: You saw it ?
DANTE: Very dramatic , I thought .
CAITLIN: It 's not what you think .
DANTE: What , it 's worse ? You 're pregnant with an Asian design major 's child ?
CAITLIN: I 'm not pregnant .
DANTE: Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation ?
CAITLIN: I was going to tell you . But then we were getting along so well , I did n't want to mess it up .
DANTE: You could 've broke it to me gently , you know ; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend . I told you I have a girlfriend .
CAITLIN: I know , I 'm sorry . But when we started talkingit 's like I forgot I had a boyfriend . And then he proposed last month
DANTE: And you said yes ?
CAITLIN: Wellkind of , sort of ?
DANTE: Is that what they teach you at that school of yours ? Kind of , sort of ? Everyone knows about this except me ! Do you know how humiliating that is ?
CAITLIN: I would 've told you , and you would have stopped calling , like a baby .
DANTE: How do you know that ?
CAITLIN: Because I know you . You prefe drastic measures to rational ones .
DANTE: So you 're really getting married ?
CAITLIN: No .
DANTE: No , you 're not really getting married ?
CAITLIN: The story goes like this He proposed , and I told him I had to think about it , and he insisted I wear the ring anyway . Then my mother told the paper we were engaged .
DANTE: How like her .
CAITLIN: Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper . That 's when I hopped the train to come back here , ecause I knew you 'd be a wreck .
DANTE: Thanks for the vote of confidence .
CAITLIN: Was I right ?
DANTE: Wreck is a harsh term . Disturbed is more like it . Mildly disturbed even .
CAITLIN: I love a macho façade . It 's such a turn-on . What smells like shoe polish ?
DANTE: And you came here to what ? To comfort me ?
CAITLIN: The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you .
DANTE: But you were .
CAITLIN: No , I was n't . Not really . I told you 'd I 'd been seeing other people .
DANTE: Yeah , but not seriously . Christ , you 're ready to walk down the aisle-I 'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody .
CAITLIN: I 'm giving him his ring back .
DANTE: What ?
CAITLIN: I do n't want to marry him . I do n't want to get married now . I 'm on the verge of graduation . I want to go to grad school after this . And then I want to start a career . I do n't want to be a wife first , and then have to worry about when I '' going to fit in all of the other stuff . I 've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife . And I know that 's what I 'd become . Sang 's already signed with a major firm , and he 's going to be pulling a huge salary , which would give me no eason to work , and he 's so traditional anyway
DANTE: Sang ? His name is a past tense ?
CAITLIN: Stop it . He 's a nice guy .
DANTE: If he 's so nice , why are n't you going to marry him ?
CAITLIN: I just told you .
DANTE: There 's more , is n't there ?
CAITLIN: Why , Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean ?
DANTE: Tell me I do n't have something to do with it .
CAITLIN: You do n't have anything to do with it .
DANTE: You lie .
CAITLIN: Look how full of yourself you are .
DANTE: I just believe in giving credit where credit is due . And I believe that I 'm the impetus behind you failure to wed .
CAITLIN: If I 'm so nuts about you , then why am I having sex with an Asian design major ?
DANTE: Jesus , you 're caustic .
CAITLIN: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on . When I say I do n't want to get married , I mean just that . I do n't want to marry anybody . Not for years .
DANTE: So who 's asking ? I do n't want to marry you .
CAITLIN: Good . Stay in that frame of mind .
DANTE: Buy can we date ?
CAITLIN: I 'm sure Sang and-Veronica ? -would like that .
DANTE: We could introduce them . They might hit it off .
CAITLIN: You 're serious . You want to date again .
DANTE: I would like to be your boyfriend , yes .
CAITLIN: It 's just the shock of seeing me after three years . Believe me , you 'll get over it .
DANTE: Give me a bit more credit . I think it 's time we got back together , you know . I 'm more mature , you 're more mature , you 're finishing college , I 'm already in the job market
CAITLIN: You work in a market , all right .
DANTE: Cute . Tell me you would n't want to go out again . After all the talking we 've been doing .
CAITLIN: The key word here is talk , Dante . I think the idea , the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date .
DANTE: Sowhat ? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we 're dating ?
CAITLIN: I do n't know . Maybe we should just see what happens .
DANTE: Let me take you out tonight .
CAITLIN: You mean , on a date ?
DANTE: Yes . A real date . Dinner and a movie .
CAITLIN: The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date . I think I 've been on that one efore .
DANTE: You have a better suggestion ?
CAITLIN: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk , Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date ?
DANTE: I hear that 's a rather popular date .
CAITLIN: Jerk . Here I am , throwing myself at you , succumbing to your wily charms , and you call me a slut , in so many words .
DANTE: What about Sing ?
CAITLIN: Sang .
DANTE: Sang .
CAITLIN: He 's not invited .
DANTE: He 's your fiancé .
CAITLIN: I offer you my body and you offe me semantics ? He 's just a boyfriend , Dante , and in case you have n't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio , I 'm about to become single again .
DANTE: So what are you saying ?
CAITLIN: You 're such an asshole .
DANTE: I 'm just kidding .
CAITLIN: I can already tell this is n't going to work .
DANTE: I 'll ask Randal to close up for me- when he gets back .
CAITLIN: Where 'd he go ? I 'd have thought he 'd be at your side , like an obedient lapdog .
DANTE: He went to rent a movie , but he has n't gotten back yet . Ah , screw it ; I 'll just lock the store up and leave him a note .
CAITLIN: You 're too responsible . But no . I have to go home first . They do n't even know I left school . And I should break the disengagement news to my mother , which is going to cause quite a row , considering she loves Sang .
DANTE: Who does n't ?
CAITLIN: Well , me I guess . So , I shall take my leave of you , ut I will return in a little while , at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you .
DANTE: What happened to the walk and the nakedness ?
CAITLIN: I 'm easy , but I 'm not that easy . See you later , handsome .
DANTE: YES !
RANDAL: Get to work .
DANTE: What 'd you rent ? Best of Both Worlds ?
RANDAL: Hermaphroditic porn . Starlets with oth organs . You should see the ox Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame .
DANTE: And this is what you rented ?
RANDAL: I like to expand my horizons .
DANTE: I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor .
RANDAL: No way !
DANTE: Five hundred dollars .
RANDAL: You 're bullshitting .
DANTE: Living proof .
RANDAL: I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids .
DANTE: I do n't ; you did .
RANDAL: Really ?
DANTE: Little girl . Maybe five years old ?
RANDAL: Holy shit . That girl ?
DANTE: As opposed to the hundreds of othe children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here .
RANDAL: Then how come you got the fine ?
DANTE: Because I 'm here .
RANDAL: You 're lying .
DANTE: I swear . I could n't make this kind of hell up .
RANDAL: Then why are n't you like screaming at me right now ?
DANTE: Because I 'm happy .
RANDAL: You 're happy ?
DANTE: I 'm happy .
RANDAL: You 're happy to get a fine ?
DANTE: No . I 'm happy because Caitlin came to see me .
RANDAL: Now I know you 're lying .
DANTE: I 'm not . She just left .
RANDAL: What did she say ?
DANTE: She 's not going to marry that guy . She went home to tell her mother .
RANDAL: You 're kidding .
DANTE: I 'm not .
RANDAL: Wow . You 've had quite an evening .
DANTE: She went home , she 's getting ready , and we 're going out .
RANDAL: I feel so ineffectual . Is there anything I can do for you ?
DANTE: Watch the store while I go home and change .
RANDAL: What happened to title dictates ehavior ?
DANTE: This is my way of spitting water at life .
RANDAL: Hey , what about Veronica ?
DANTE: No ! Do n't bring it up . I do n't want to think about that now . Let me enjoy this hour of bliss . I 'll think about all of that later . In the meantime , nobody mentions the V word .
RANDAL: You 're a snake .
DANTE: In my absence , try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns .
RANDAL: You want me to bring the VCR ove here so we can watch this ?
DANTE: I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin , in which case you 'll have to close the store tonight .
RANDAL: All right , but you 're missing out . Chicks with dicks .
DANTE: I 'll read the book .
CUSTOMER: Cute cat . What 's his name .
RANDAL: Peptic ulcer .
CAITLIN: Randal Graves-scourge of the video enter .
RANDAL: Ladies and gentleman , Mrs. Asian Design Major herself Caitlin Bree !
CAITLIN: You saw that article ? God , is n't it awful ? My mother sent that in .
RANDAL: I take it she likes the guy .
CAITLIN: You 'd think she was marrying him . What are you watching ?
RANDAL: Children 's programming . What did your mom say when you told her you were n't engaged anymore ?
CAITLIN: She said not to come home until graduation .
RANDAL: Wow , you got thrown out ? For Dante ?
CAITLIN: What can I say ? He does weird things to me .
RANDAL: Can I watch ?
CAITLIN: You can hold me down .
RANDAL: Can I join in ?
CAITLIN: You might be let down . I 'm not a hermaphrodite .
RANDAL: Few are . So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around ?
CAITLIN: A woman 's intuition . Something in me says it 's time to give the old oy a serious try .
RANDAL: Wow . Hey , I was just about to orde some dinner . You eat Chinese , right ?
CAITLIN: Dick .
RANDAL: Exactly .
CAITLIN: So where is he ?
RANDAL: He went home to change for the big date .
CAITLIN: God , is n't he great ?
RANDAL: No , this is great .
CAITLIN: Can I use the bathroom ?
RANDAL: There 's no light back there .
CAITLIN: Why are n't there any lights ?
RANDAL: Well , there are , but for some eason they stop working at five- fourteen every night .
CAITLIN: You 're kidding .
RANDAL: Nobody can figure it out . And the oss does n't want to pay the electrician to fix it , because the electrician owes money to the video store .
CAITLIN: Such a sordid state of affair .
RANDAL: And I 'm caught in the middle-torn etween my loyalty for the boss , and my desire to piss with the light on .
CAITLIN: I 'll try to manage . She heads toward the back .
RANDAL: Hey Caitlin Break his heart again this time , and I 'll kill you . Nothing personal .
CAITLIN: You 're very protective of him , Randal . You always have been .
RANDAL: Territoriality . He was mine first .
CAITLIN: Awww . That was so cute .
MOTHER: A pack of cigarettes . The SMALL CHILD points at the TV screen .
SMALL CHILD: Cunt !
DANTE: Who eats cock ?
RANDAL: Bunch of savages in this town . Hey , Caitlin 's in the back . You might want to see if she 's okay ; she 's been back there a long time .
DANTE: There 's no lights back there .
RANDAL: I told her that . She said she did n't need any . Why do n't you join her , man . Make a little bathroom am-bam .
DANTE: I love your sexy talk . It 's sokindergarten Poo-poo ; wee-wee .
RANDAL: Fuck you .
CAITLIN: How 'd you get here so fast ?
DANTE: I left like an hour ago .
CAITLIN: Do you always talk weird after you violate women ? RANDAL and DANTE stare at CAITLIN , confused .
RANDAL: Maybe the Asian design majo slipped her some opium ?
DANTE: Could be .
CAITLIN: Promise me it 'll always be like that .
DANTE: Like what ?
CAITLIN: When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything .
DANTE: Umokay .
RANDAL: Am I missing something here ?
CAITLIN: I went back there , and Dante was already waiting for me .
RANDAL: He was ?
CAITLIN: It was so cool . He did n't say a word . He was justready , you know ? And we did n't kiss or talk o anything . He just sat there and let me do all the work .
RANDAL: You dog ! I did n't see you go back there . DANTE is bewildered .
CAITLIN: And the fact that there were n't any lights made it so God ! That was so great !
DANTE: It was n't me .
CAITLIN: Yeah , right . Who was it Randal ?
DANTE: Was it you ?
RANDAL: I was here the whole time .
CAITLIN: You two better quit it .
DANTE: I 'm serious .
CAITLIN: We did n't just have sex in the athroom ?
DANTE: No . Everyone is silent . Then
CAITLIN: Stop this . This is n't funny .
DANTE: I 'm not kidding . I just got back from outside .
CAITLIN: This is n't fucking funny , Dante !
DANTE: I 'm not fooling around ! Who went back there ?
RANDAL: Nobody ! I swear !
CAITLIN: I feel nauseous .
DANTE: Are you sure somebody was back there ?
CAITLIN: I did n't just fuck myself ! Jesus , I 'm going to be sick !
RANDAL: You just fucked a total stranger ?
DANTE: Shut the fuck up !
CAITLIN: I ca n't believe this ! I feel faint
DANTE: Call the police .
RANDAL: Why ?
CAITLIN: No , do n't !
DANTE: There 's a strange man in ou athroom , and he just raped Caitlin !
CAITLIN: Oh God
RANDAL: She said she did all the work .
DANTE: WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP ?
CORONER: What time was this ?
DANTE: UmI do n't know . What time did hockey end ?
RANDAL: Around three or something .
DANTE: What time did we go to the funeral ?
RANDAL: I think four .
CORONER: Wait a second ? Who was working here today ?
DANTE: Just me .
CORONER: I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral .
DANTE: We did .
CORONER: Then who operated the store ?
DANTE: Nobody . It was closed .
CORONER: With this guy locked in ?
DANTE: Everything happened at once . I guess I forgot he was back there . Ambulance attendants join them .
ATTENDANT 1: Can we take this now ?
CORONER: Go ahead .
DANTE: Was he alive whenCaitlin
CORONER: No . I place the time of death at about three-twenty .
RANDAL: Then how could sheyou know
CORONER: The body can maintain an erection after expiration . Sometimes fo hours . Did he have the adult magazine when he came in ?
DANTE: No . I gave it to him . RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief .
CORONER: I ca n't say for certain until we get him back to the lab , but my guess is he was masturbating , his heart seized and he died . That 's when the girl found him . Something smells like shoe polish .
RANDAL: This has got ta be the weirdest thing you 've ever been called in on .
CORONER: Actually , I once had to tag a kid that broke his neck trying to put his mouth on his penis . RANDAL looks down , anonymously .
DANTE: What about Caitlin ?
CORONER: Shock trauma . She 's going to need years of therapy after this . My question is , How did she come to have sex with the dead man ?
DANTE: She thought it was me . The CORONER stares at DANTE .
CORONER: What kind of convenience store do you run here ?
RANDAL: Do you think he was talking about my cousin ?
JAY: I knew one of those motherfuckers was gon na kill somebody one day .
RANDAL: Salsa shark . DANTE says nothing .
DANTE: This life .
RANDAL: This life ?
DANTE: Why do I have this life ?
RANDAL: Have some chips ; you 'll feel better .
DANTE: I 'm stuck in this pit , earning less than slave wages , working on my day off , dealing with every backward fuck on the planet , the goddam steel shutters are locked all day , I smell like shoe polish , I 've got an ex-girlfriend who 's catatonic after fucking a dead guy , and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks .
RANDAL: Thirty-seven .
DANTE: My life is in the shitter right about now , so if you do n't mind , I 'd like to stew a bit .
RANDAL: Yeah .
DANTE: I was born . RANDAL comes back .
RANDAL: You should shit or get off the pot .
DANTE: I should shit or get off the pot .
RANDAL: Yeah , you should shit or get off the pot .
DANTE: What are you talking about ?
RANDAL: I 'm talking about this thing you havethis inability to improve your situation in life .
DANTE: Fuck you .
RANDAL: It 's true . You 'll sit there and lame life for dealing a cruddy hand , never once accepting the esponsibility for the way you situation is .
DANTE: What responsibility ?
RANDAL: All right , if you hate this job and the people , and the fact that you have to come in on your day off , then quit .
DANTE: As if it 's that easy .
RANDAL: It is . You just up and quit . There are other jobs , and they pay bette money . You 're bound to be qualified for at least one of them . So what 's stopping you ?
DANTE: Leave me alone .
RANDAL: You 're comfortable . This is a life of convenience for you , and any attempt to change it would shatte the pathetic microcosm you 've fashioned for yourself .
DANTE: Oh , like your life 's any better ?
RANDAL: I 'm satisfied with my situation fo now . You do n't hear me bitching . You , on the other hand , have been itching all day .
DANTE: Thank you . Why do n't you go back to the video store ?
RANDAL: It 's the same thing with Veronica .
DANTE: Leave her out of this .
RANDAL: You date Veronica because she 's low maintenance and because it 's convenient . Meanwhile , all you eve do is talk about Caitlin . You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school fo God 's sake ! You 're twenty-two !
DANTE: Leave me alone .
RANDAL: If you want Caitlin , then face Veronica , tell her , and be with Caitlin . If you want Veronica , be with Veronica . But do n't pine fo one and fuck the other . Man , if you were n't such a fucking coward
DANTE: If I was n't such a fucking coward . It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do .
RANDAL: Am I right or what ?
DANTE: You 're wrong . Things happened today , okay ? Things that probably uined my chances with Caitlin .
RANDAL: What ? The dead guy ? She 'll get ove fucking the dead guy . Shit , my mom 's been fucking a dead guy fo thirty years ; I call him Dad .
DANTE: Caitlin and I ca n't be together . It 's impossible .
RANDAL: Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement .
DANTE: What do you want me to say ? Yes , I suppose some of the things you 're saying may be true . But that 's the way things are ; it 's not going to change .
RANDAL: Make them change .
DANTE: I ca n't , all right ! Jesus , would you leave me alone ? I ca n't make changes like that in my life . If I could , I would-but I do n't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes .
RANDAL: Who 're you kidding ? You can so .
DANTE: Jesus H. Christ , I ca n't !
RANDAL: So you 'll continue being miserable all the time , just because you do n't have the guts to face change ?
DANTE: My mother told me once that when I as three , my potty lid was closed , and instead of lifting it , I chose to shit my pants .
RANDAL: Lovely story .
DANTE: Point is-I 'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably .
JAY: Noinch , noinch , noinch-smoking weed , smoking weed ! Doing coke ! Drinking beers ! A pack of wraps , my good man . It 's time to kick back , drink some eers , and smoke some weed !
DANTE: Done poisoning the youth for the day ?
JAY: Hell yes , whatever that means . Now I 'm gon na head over to Atlantic , drink some beers , get ripped , and- please God-get laid . E-Z Wider , one-and-a-halfs .
DANTE: One seventy-nine .
JAY: Pay the good man . Do n't you close soon ?
DANTE: A half hour .
JAY: We get off about the same time every night . We should hang out . You get high ?
DANTE: I should start .
JAY: Wan na come to this party tonight ? There 's gon na be some pussy there , man !
DANTE: With you ? I do n't think so .
JAY: Listen to you . Oh shit . `` Oh , I do n't hang out with drug dealers . ''
DANTE: Nothing personal . SILENT BOB hands weed to JAY .
JAY: I work , just like you . You 're more of a crook than I am , dude .
DANTE: How do you figureHEY ! You ca n't oll a joint in here !
JAY: Relax brother . What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around . A dolla seventy-nine for wraps-what 's that shit ?
DANTE: It 's not my store .
JAY: And these are n't my drugs-I just sell them .
DANTE: The difference is you exploit a weakness .
JAY: What 's that mean ?
DANTE: You sell to people that ca n't stay away from an addiction .
JAY: All right . How much is Pepsi here ?
DANTE: A dollar sixty-nine , plus tax .
JAY: At Food City it 's ninety-nine cents , plus tax .
DANTE: So .
JAY: So why do you sell it for so much more ? I 'll tell you why-because people come here and they 're like `` A dollar eighty for soda ? I should get it at Food City . But I do n't feel like driving there . I 'll just uy it here so I do n't have to drive up there . '' That 's exploiting a weakness , too , is n't it ?
DANTE: I ca n't believe you just rolled a joint in here .
JAY: Hey , man , what happened with that old guy ?
DANTE: He died in the bathroom .
JAY: That 's fucked up . Yo , I heard he was jerkin ' off .
DANTE: I do n't know . I was n't watching .
JAY: Probably saw that Caitlin chick . I know I felt like beatin ' it when I saw her . Come here , bitch ! You like this ? Is this what you want ? Hunhh ?
DANTE: Knock it off . That used to be my girlfriend .
JAY: You used to go out with her ?
DANTE: We were going to start again , I think .
JAY: Do n't you already have a girlfriend ?
DANTE: Veronica .
JAY: Is she that girl who 's down here all the time ? She came here today carrying a plate of food .
DANTE: Lasagne .
JAY: And what-you were gon na dump her to date that Caitlin chick ?
DANTE: Maybe .
JAY: I do n't know dude . That Caitlin chick 's nice . But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time . She brings you food , she rubs your backDid n't I see her change your tire one day ?
DANTE: I jacked the car up . All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on .
JAY: Damn . She sure goes out of her way .
DANTE: She 's my girlfriend .
JAY: I 've had girlfriends , but all they wanted from me was weed and shit . Shit , my grandma used to say , `` Which is better a good plate with nothing on it '' No , wait . I fucked up . She said `` What 's a good- looking plate with nothing on it ? ''
DANTE: Meaning ?
JAY: I do n't know . She was senile and shit . Used to piss herself all the time . C'mon Silent Bob . Exit JAY . SILENT BOB stands there .
SILENT BOB: You know , there 's a million fine- looking women in the world , but they do n't all bring you lasagne at work . Most of them just cheat on you .
DANTE: He 's right . I love her .
RANDAL: So that 's it . He does n't love you anymore . He loves Caitlin . VERONICA stares , dumbfounded .
VERONICA: Andhe told you all of this ?
RANDAL: Pretty much . All except the latent homosexuality part-that 's just my theory .
VERONICA: II do n't know what to say .
RANDAL: Do n't hold it against him . He just never got Caitlin out of his system . It 's not your fault . It 's Dante . I do n't know thing one about chicks . Do you want to cry or something ? I can leave .
VERONICA: I 'm not sad .
RANDAL: You 're not ?
VERONICA: No , I 'm more furious . I 'm pissed off . I feel like he 's been killing time while he tries to grow the alls to tell me how he really feels , and then he ca n't even do it ! He has his friend do it for him !
RANDAL: He did n't ask me to
VERONICA: After all that I 've done for that fuck ! And he wants to be with that slut ? Fine ! He can have his slut !
RANDAL: Um , do you think you can give me a lift home tonight ?
VERONICA: I 'm going to have a word with that asshole . VERONICA storms out .
RANDAL: Wait ! VeronicaI do n't think
CUSTOMER: Oooh ! Navy Seals !
DANTE: What the fuck did you do that for ?
VERONICA: If you did n't want to go out with me anymore , why did n't you just say it ? Instead , you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back !
DANTE: What 're you talking about ?
VERONICA: You 've been talking to her on the phone for weeks !
DANTE: It was only a few times
VERONICA: And then you pull that shit this morning , freaking out because I 've gone down on a couple guys !
DANTE: A couple ?
VERONICA: I 'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex , sneaking around behind your back ! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot , then just wait , mister I 'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now !
DANTE: Would you let me explain
VERONICA: Explain what ? How you were waiting until the time was right , and then you were going to dump me for her ?
DANTE: VeronicaIit 's not like that anymoreI mean , it was neve eally like that
VERONICA: You 're damn right it 's not like that ! Because I wo n't let it be like that ! You want your slut ? Fine ! The slut is yours !
DANTE: I do n't want Caitlin
VERONICA: You do n't know what you want , but I 'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out ! I 've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go ack to school , to take charge of your life and find direction . I even transferred so maybe you would e more inclined to go back to college if I was with you . Everyone said it was a stupid move , but I did n't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you 've been in since that whore dumped you , oh so many years ago . And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more ?
DANTE: I do n't want to go back with her
VERONICA: Of course not ; not now ! You 're caught , and now you 're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do . Well , I wo n't let you . I want you to follow through on this , just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are . And when she dumps you again-and she will , Dante , I promise you that-when she dumps you again , I want to laugh at you , right in your face , just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for ! I 'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me , since you could n't .
DANTE: Randal ?
VERONICA: And having him tell methat was just the weakest move ever . You 're spineless .
DANTE: Veronica , I love you
VERONICA: Fuck you .
RANDAL: Dante ?
DANTE: The swelling 's not so bad . But the FDS stings . How 's your neck ?
RANDAL: It 's hard to swallow . They are both silent . Then
DANTE: Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her fo Caitlin ?
RANDAL: I thought I was doing you a favor .
DANTE: Thanks .
RANDAL: You were saying how you could n't initiate change yourself , so I figured I 'd help you out .
DANTE: Jesus . Silence . Then
RANDAL: You still did n't have to choke me .
DANTE: Oh please ! I 'm surprised I did n't kill you .
RANDAL: Why do you say that ?
DANTE: Why do I say that ? Randalforget it .
RANDAL: No , really . What did I do that was so wrong ?
DANTE: What do n't you do ? Randal , sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable .
RANDAL: How do you figure ?
DANTE: What time did you get to work today ?
RANDAL: Like ten after .
DANTE: You were over half an hour late . Then all you do is come over here .
RANDAL: To talk to you .
DANTE: Which means the video store is ostensibly closed .
RANDAL: It 's not like I 'm miles away .
DANTE: Unless you 're out renting videos at other video stores .
RANDAL: Hermaphrodites ! I rented it so we could watch it together !
DANTE: You get my slapped with a fine , you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up . You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse . To top it all off , you uin my relationship . What 's you encore ? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank ?
RANDAL: Fuck you . Fuck you , pal . Listen to you trying to pass the buck again . I 'm the source of all your misery . Who closed the store to play hockey ? Who closed the store to attend a wake ? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one ? You wan na blame somebody , blame yourself . `` I 'm not even supposed to be here today . '' You sound like an asshole . Whose choice was it to be here today ? Nobody twisted your arm . You 're here today of your own violation , my friend . But you 'd like to elieve that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante was n't here . Well , I got news fo you , jerk This store would survive without you . Without me either . All you do is overcompensate for having what 's basically a monkey 's job You push fucking buttons . Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs , ut you 're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important , so much more epic than it really is . You work in a convenience store , Dante . And badly , I might add . And I work in a shitty video store . Badly , as well . You know , that guy Jay 's got it ight-he has no delusions about what he does . Us ? We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here , just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid-cigarettes . We look down on them , as it we 're so advanced . Well , if we 're so fucking advanced , then what are we doing working here ?
DANTE: You need a ride ?
RANDAL: Got one . Just pulled up . They stand in silence . Then
DANTE: Do you work tomorrow ?
RANDAL: Same time . What about you ?
DANTE: I 'm calling out . Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is . Then try to see Veronica .
RANDAL: You wan na grab something to eat tomorrow nightafter I get out of here ?
DANTE: I 'll call you . Let you know .
RANDAL: All right . Good luck with Veronica . If you want , I can talk to her , you know , and explain
DANTE: No thanks . I 'll take care of it . We 've got a lot of shit to talk about .
RANDAL: Helluva day .
DANTE: To say the least .
RANDAL: Do you need a hug or something ? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging youyou know , you eing a guy and all . Just do n't knead my ass when you do it .
DANTE: Get the fuck outta here already .
RANDAL: I 'm gone . I 'll talk to you tomorrow .
DANTE: What 'd you forget something ? Oh . I 'm sorry , we 're closed .
CUSTOMER: Hello ? Little help ?
FRANK: Wait a minute there 's Hal . And his date .
MAGGIE: How do they look ?
HAL: Excuse me I know you 're my salvation , and all do you think you could rescue us before your smoke eak ?
GABE: Maybe you could tell me why I am escuing you .
HAL: Basically I 've fallen down , and I ca n't get up
GABE: Rescue One have located helpless climber , please prepare idiot line for transport , over
HAL: Rescue One please remind me to tell you about the time I hauled your hero here down Mt . Huntington on my back , over
GABE: This guy showing you a good time ?
GABE: Now , remember keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times
HAL: Fuck you
GABE: Ready ? Did he tell you about the time he almost made it up Everest ?
SUSAN: He said you gave him a bad oxygen mask
GABE: Well , if he 's bored you with that ullshit , then this has to be the best part of a bad date . Right ? Susan nervously laughs .
SUSAN: Okay
GABE: Yes you can . You can do it . Do n't look down . The whole way across , do n't look down . Look at me . Just keep looking at me and you 'll be okay .
SUSAN: Yeah . I have always depended on the kindness of Rangers .
STEWARDESS: Take this . Afraid of flying ? Gabe shakes his head .
GABE: Falling .
RENTAL AGENT: Midsize ?
GABE: Any size , any color , any model .
RENTAL AGENT: How long will you be needing it ?
GABE: Just under six hours .
GABE: This is new
MAGGIE: It 's a thermal scope picks up body heat of lost hikers
GABE: Still find the dead ones the old fashioned way , I guess .
MAGGIE: You could have said goodbye .
GABE: If I did , I 'd have to listen to you tell me one more time that it was n't my fault .
MAGGIE: Today especially today you get to hear it again . The harness clip oke . Cold stress one in a million equipment failure . You and Hal could have checked it from then till now and it still would have happened . You did everything right
GABE: If I did everything right , Susan Collins would still be alive .
GABE: Do you really believe all that ? That it was n't our fault ?
MAGGIE: Yes . Yes , I do .
GABE: I 'm not sure what I wish more , Maggie . That you meant what you said , just now or that it were really true then .
HAL: Maggie , where the hell have you been ? I 've got two climbers out
GABE: Christ . You 're in charge of Rescue now ?
HAL: There was a vacancy . Maybe you heard about it . The last guy lost his nerve and lit out of town .
GABE: Well , you 're a better man than I am , Hal . Nothing rattles you .
FRANK: Gabe ! Long time , son why do n't you come meet some of the new guys
GABE: Good idea . Say , Hal ? Why do n't you come with me so we can show these rookies how to death-rig a woman properly ?
HAL: Take the Bronco to where you 're going . I 've already been . Then go back to wherever it is you like to hide . And stay there .
TRAVERS: Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment is ready .
DAVID: Right away , Mr. Travers . As Davis dials we move to
WRIGHT: Good good . I 'll be right down .
MATHESON: Walter Wright ? Matheson . FBI . We need to talk .
PILOT: We 'll be fueled and ready in ten minutes , Mr. Travers .
TRAVERS: Be ready in five .
MATHESON: Matheson . FBI .
TRAVERS: Your parents must be proud . What the fuck is this about ?
WRIGHT: Small problem with the shipment , Travers . Tell him what you just told me .
MATHESON: We got word that somebody 's been observing your currency shipments this load , the $ 5,000s over the last three deliveries .
TRAVERS: There is n't a hell of a lot anyone can do but observe . This is the most protected shipment we 've got and the most useless fo a thief . Those bills are n't in circulation . You think five thousand dollar bills are easy to pass ? Who the fuck would try ? Matheson hands Travers a folder .
MATHESON: This guy might .
TRAVERS: Who is he ?
MATHERS: His name 's Eric Qualen . One of the East German spies who got shut out by the reunification . The CIA issued an inter-agency warning about him right after the wall came down . He 's got nowhere to go and nothing to lose . He 's also got the international connections to get rid of bills like these and he 's probably desperate enough to try for them . Fifty million ucks buys a lot of sanctuary .
TRAVERS: Could you get to the part where I 'm supposed to care ?
MATHESON: We had two agents monitoring him . These two Gleason and Quinones . Their last report said he was going to try to take this shipment .
TRAVERS: Thanks for the tip . But I 've got work to do .
MATHESON: Did I say `` last '' report ? I think I did . I mean last fucking report . These guys have vanished .
TRAVERS: You have my sympathy , but There 's a reason we do things this way , all right ? Armored cars can be hijacked . Trains can be derailed . But nobody can get to us in flight . The only time this is on the ground is at the mint , or on the Presidio runway in San Francisco . Either way , someone would have to shoot his way past a couple of thousand guards . Matheson still is n't convinced .
MATHESON: Who said anything about stopping the shipment ? I 've been tracking Qualen for almost a year . If he pulls something , I want to e in on the party .
WRIGHT: This is cleared from the top , Travers . Matheson will accompany you on the flight to San Francisco . Show him every professional courtesy .
MAGGIE: Rescue One to base , over .
EVAN: Way to check the weather , Brett .
BRETT: Hey . If it were easy , it would n't be worth d-doing .
AGENT: Just enjoy the view , huh ? Relax . I mean , what could happen in the air ?
TRAVERS: Stay put ! Do n't panic , goddammit ! Travers moves into
PILOT: He 's coming in too slow .
TRAVERS: No we 're going too fast , and we 're too high up . Push flaps forward twenty degrees and drop to five thousand feet .
MATHESON: You got any rifles ?
AGENT: Forward compartment left side
TRAVERS: What the hell are you doing
MATHESON: Checked the plane from top to bottom , huh ? You fucker Put your hands behind your head ! It 's over !
TRAVERS: Calm down give the gun to me
MATHESON: There 's a couple of dead bodies in the front compartment they 're FBI agents
TRAVERS: He 's losing it
MATHESON: Goddamn it ! Do n't you see what he 's doing ! He 's hijacking the fucking shipment ! Do n't make me shoot you !
TRAVERS: Do n't make me laugh .
KRISTEL: Moving into lateral position .
PILOT: We 're right on the edge of the storm let 's move it .
TRAVERS: So what . He 'll sift though a plane that went down in a storm find enough pulverized bone for six men heroically killed in the line of duty and just enough of the right kind of ash .
QUALEN: Travers hurry it up .
TRAVERS: On my way .
TRAVERS: That charge is going to blow both engines the plane 'll go down like a ock , so clip yourself on to the end of the cable with the money as soon as I get over . And make sure you bring the right cases .
QUALEN: Why did n't you send the money over ?
TRAVERS: Somehow , I did n't think you 'd have waited for me if I 'd sent it first .
TRAVERS: Get underneath the jet ! The cases will slide over !
TRAVERS: Lower ! Get underneath it !
KRISTEL: It 's dragging us down ! Disconnect the cable !
KRISTEL: So much for phase one . Now what ?
TRAVERS: Now we call the police .
HAL: Look I know there 's a storm , but that was n't thunder .
FRANK: Hal , when you 've been in this line as long as I have The station 's scanner radio barks to life .
HAL: Rocky Mountain Rescue come in , mayday
KRISTEL: Downed charter flight alpha-charlie-niner dead , seven seriously wounded , acknowledge
HAL: Acknowledged , mayday . What 's you position ?
QUALEN: Not bad . The insulin was a nice touch .
MAGGIE: Hey there
GABE: Hi . Could you introduce us ?
MAGGIE: Sure . Gabe Walker this is A27 . A27 Gabe .
GABE: Not the tag what do you call him ?
MAGGIE: Her . I call her Lucky .
GABE: Poachers ? Bastards
MAGGIE: They got the mother and left this one behind . Too small to make a decent trophy , I guess .
GABE: About four months , right ? Christ it must have been just about his I mean her first flight
MAGGIE: Time to change the dressing .
GABE: You ca n't do that alone
MAGGIE: I 've had to learn . She trust me
GABE: I 'm making her nervous You hold her , I 'll do the dressing .
MAGGIE: The usual . Flew off never calls , never writes
GABE: I thought I came back to see if I 'd learned to live with it . Well , big surprise . Coming back just tore me open all over again , like it all happened yesterday instead of a yea ago . Nothing 's changed . Including the way I feel about you . I did n't realize it till I saw you at the airport . But I came back for you , Maggie .
MAGGIE: Does that mean you 're going to stay ?
GABE: No . Not here . I want you come with me . Start over , somewhere else .
MAGGIE: You come back after being gone a year , and you expect me to You do n't live here any more , Gabe . Your choice , remember ? But this is my home . I 'm not leaving . You can stay with me , or you can go alone . It 's still your choice .
GABE: What the hell do you want ?
HAL: I need your help . A plane 's gone down on Comb Bluff . This storm would blow a copter all over the place but we can climb up to it .
GABE: `` We '' ? Talk to somebody who 's still on the payroll . You 've got a half dozen new guys
HAL: who could n't climb that wall now if there were stairs cut into it . But you 've soloed it .
GABE: During the summer . On a bet .
HAL: This is a little more important than a et . Just a few injured people with no first aid or shelter , camping in a zero degree blizzard . They 'll be ice sculptures by tomorrow morning .
GABE: Maybe you missed the headlines but I do n't do rescues any more . They 're ad for my conscience . Fuck this one up on your own .
HAL: Play it again , Gabe , about how we killed her . I was there too , remember ?
GABE: Not like I was , pal her fingers ushed mine on the way down
HAL: and I was the one who had to deal with her family when you fucking tore out of town . We lost her . Whatever anybody says about cold stress and the clip , you and I have to live with that . But ight now , there are some more people who need our help , and they should n't die too just because you 've got a problem keeping the past in the past .
GABE: I do n't want the responsibility .
HAL: Walk away and you are responsible . They 'll die . I ca n't do this alone . You know what else , Gabe ? You can go anywhere you want , but if you do n't do this , now , you 're going to be stuck on that goddamn ledge for the rest of your life .
GABE: Just backup .
HAL: Save the rope for when it gets tough . That bet was for you to free clim the wall .
GABE: Tell you what , Hal if we 're still alive tomorrow morning , I 'll give you the twenty bucks back , okay ?
GABE: It 's kind of hard to resist
TRAVERS: Have they arrived ? Good . Return to the plane and cove your tracks .
QUALEN: Get ready .
GABE: Come on the hard part 's over . Gabe heads up and ove
HAL: That 's it .
GABE: I thought the fuselage was broken . That looks pretty cozy .
HAL: The pilot was hysterical .
GABE: Something 's wrong here
HAL: Does this look like a prank to you ? Come on
TRAVERS: Where ?
HAL: Where ? What are you
TRAVERS: You said `` we '' . Where are the rest ?
QUALEN: He does n't have one . Just a wallet .
TRAVERS: Gabe Walker Very attractive .
GABE: My ex .
TRAVERS: Too bad . Let me tell you what 's on fo today . We 'd like you to help settle a wager . You see , we lost some luggage
GABE: This way .
HAL: Can you climb faster than they can shoot ?
GABE: We 've got to try something . Think we 'll get a finder 's fee after they get all their `` luggage '' ?
HAL: Sure . All the bullets we can eat .
GABE: That 's not what really worries me .
HAL: There 's something else to worry about ?
GABE: Yeah . Once they 've got what they 're after they 're gon na need a copte to get out of here .
HAL: Maggie .
TRAVERS: Hold it . It 's up there .
GABE: I 'll need the ice axe .
TRAVERS: You 've got to be kidding .
GABE: Okay . How about some tape ?
QUALEN: I do n't trust him .
TRAVERS: Where could he go ?
QUALEN: I 'd rather he did n't show us . We do n't need two guides .
TRAVERS: You win . Kill him when he gets down .
GABE: Jesus .
TRAVERS: Lower it down now !
QUALEN: Bring the money down , or we kill you friend !
TRAVERS: We ca n't . And he knows it .
QUALEN: No . We need him to get the rest of the money . If he dies we lose everything
TRAVERS: Get us out of here .
EVAN: What the hell
EVAN: What the fuck is going on here ?
BRETT: Let 's catch up and find out .
MAGGIE: Rescue Unit what 's going on , Hall ? over
TRAVERS: No tricks , no procedural codes , no personal messages just tell them everything 's under control and you 're taking care of the wounded .
HAL: We 've reached the wreckage top of Comb Bluff six injured , but they 're esponding to treatment . Everything A-OK. Over .
TRAVERS: Have her come up .
HAL: Forget it downdrafts would wipe he all over the peaks Not that I expect you to give a shit , but it 's our only copter . You 'll be stuck . Travers relents and hands the radio back .
MAGGIE: Acknowledged . Let me talk to Gabe over
TRAVERS: Good . You might live longer than you friend . Now what ?
HAL: The next one 's on top of the peak . This 'll be long , but easy more like a hike than a climb .
TRAVERS: It looks like a winding route .
HAL: There 's a more direct route . The East Face . But it 's the wall on the othe side , and it 's smooth as glass . Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather . Only a psycho would try it in a snowstorm .
WRIGHT: Okay I know it 's not in San Francisco . I know it 's not here . I know it 's not in any fucking airport from here to Montana . Where it 's not - we got that covered . Now , do you have any ideas on where it is ?
DAVIS: There 's no radio contact , sir . At all . We 're not receiving the tracer signal from the cockpit 's flight recorder . Radar lost it after it went low here .
WRIGHT: Air search ?
DAVIS: That storm has n't quit yet . Weathe service says we 've got it until tomorrow morning at least . Even if we could get a plane up now , it 'd be impossible to see anything on the ground . And Wright slumps into a chair .
WRIGHT: The roads are shut down , right ?
DAVIS: Most of this area does n't even have oads .
WRIGHT: Keep two copters on full standby . And let me know the second that storm starts to wind down .
GABE: A steambath . A steambath and a bottle of whiskey . A steambath with a bottle of Glenlivet . And a fire . A steambath with a bottle of Glenlivet and a steak . A steak soaked with Glenlivet , cooking over a steambath on fire .
GABE: Sorry , Gordon I promise I 'll have it back tomorrow . Gabe SMASHES the glass as we move to
HAL: Come on tourists take this trail .
TRAVERS: Is this it ?
HAL: Yeah . This is it .
TRAVERS: Good . Get out of the way .
TRAVERS: He 's still alive . He 's still alive ! He ca n't be far away spread out !
QUALEN: Follow him !
KYNETTE: After you .
HAL: Well look at the bright side . At least you 've only got to make the split five ways now .
GABE: Mmm . Just like chicken .
DAVIS: We 've got a fix on the plane , sir we 're getting a reading on the flight ecorder tracer
WRIGHT: Any visual ? Any radio contact ?
DAVIS: Not yet
WRIGHT: Get the copters ready . We take off in three minutes .
DAVIS: The winds are still too strong
WRIGHT: Sorry to hear it . We 're still going . The plane might be intact .
DAVIS: Sir
WRIGHT: Shut up . That fifty million is n't coming out of my pension .
TRAVERS: Still interested in staying alive ?
HAL: It 's up here . Somewhere on the Tower . There 's a way to cross over to the top in about half a day .
TRAVERS: Show me .
BRETT: I 'll cut around this side , and wind up in front . You come up behind them quietly . And we 've got 'em .
EVAN: Brett they 've got five guns
BRETT: And you can collect them all after I get the drop on 'em . Let 's get moving .
TRAVERS: `` End of the line '' ? That 's classic . You 've got style . So , I 'm going to give you a three-count to figure out how to turn the safety off .
BRETT: Nice try . I 've got one of these at home . Now drop 'em .
HAL: Brett , behind you !
TRAVERS: Time to
EVAN: What are we going to do
HAL: You came up here to jump the spur This 'd be a great time to do it .
EVAN: But
HAL: Listen they do n't know you 're up here I 'll draw their fire , you 've got to make the jump and get help .
EVAN: I do n't I uh
HAL: Unless you want to do it the other way around ?
KRISTEL: Stop ! Hal , caught again , freezes in his tracks .
GABE: Come on wait till you 're out of ange do n't pull it yet
QUALEN: Was that Walker ?
TRAVERS: No such luck . Cheer up . Everyone should die in a spot this beautiful .
GABE: Do n't worry . You will .
FRANK: Maggie what are you doing
MAGGIE: I 'm going to go nuts if I sit here one more hour .
FRANK: Still a little breezy out , Mag
MAGGIE: You coming ?
TRAVERS: Forget about it . He 's smart , but he 's not invisible .
STUART: Well , sir it crashed . That , I can confirm . We 've been here just about one hour . These events take months to analyze . So if you 'll excuse me
WRIGHT: No , I do n't think I will . The reason the FAA pays you is to exercise you vast , amazing knowledge of these `` events '' . So I expect you to come up with some stunning insights , something a slow-witted fuck like me has n't already observed . One it did n't blow up in mid-air , ecause the debris is n't widely dispersed . But was there a bomb on oard that could have disabled it ? I wonder . Two There was n't an attempted landing . Otherwise , there 'd be debris to the east of the wreckage , where the plane was coming from . Did it come straight down ? That 's got me scratching my head too . And three the flight recorder 's tracer led us here in the first place . So where is the goddamn thing ? That one 's got me all aflush with curiosity .
STUART: You 'll be the first to know .
WRIGHT: Oh , I believe you .
TRAVERS: I thought you said there was an easy way across .
HAL: There is . You might not like it much . Hal points
HAL: Of course we 'll have to do it hand over hand . Seems I forgot my harness . Sorry .
TRAVERS: Do n't be . Lead on .
GABE: I did n't need to see that . I really did n't .
FRANK: Got 'em they 're under the trees
MAGGIE: Hal ! Gabe ! Maggie runs into the trees , headlong into
FRANK: Damn fool . Why would anybody try that in the middle of a storm .
MAGGIE: Why would anybody try at all . Get the bag .
GABE: Should 've taken that left turn at Albequerque .
MAGGIE: Bring it down here .
FRANK: Maggie
MAGGIE: Just do it , Frank .
FRANK: Maggie , this is dumb
MAGGIE: No it is n't . I 'm going to find Brett I do n't want to have to talk to his widow too . Fly Evan 's body ack to base I 'll call you when I 've found Brett . Or Hal . Or Gabe . Or anybody .
KYNETTE: I 'm going back .
TRAVERS: Look this part is nothing , elieve me
KYNETTE: Walker should be coming up by now .
MAGGIE: Yes . Where is he ?
KYNETTE: You do n't know either ? I am sorry . That was question number two . Thanks for your time .
GABE: Come on
MAGGIE: Where ?
GABE: Here .
GABE: Stop .
MAGGIE: We ca n't
GABE: I need to stop .
TRAVERS: Do n't tell me
QUALEN: He 's still alive .
MAGGIE: It hurts just looking at you .
GABE: Try it from this side . Do you still have your radio ?
MAGGIE: It 's not going to work in here .
GABE: Let 's give it a try . I 'm in bad need of a ride . Come in , Rescue Unit
QUALEN: Patience .
GABE: Is there anybody else on the radio ? Maggie shakes her head no .
QUALEN: Try to get thirty million in entertainment out of this , because he is definitely in for thirty million worth of pain .
HAL: You sick fuck
QUALEN: Do n't worry . They may still be alive . That was the small one .
FRANK: Jesus that 's some flare .
MAGGIE: Why are they doing this ?
MAGGIE: We might be able to get up that way there 's an opening
GABE: No there could be another bomb up there even if there is n't , we could get another cave-in . The only sure way out is through the side .
DAVIS: I 've got something here .
STUART: Let 's have it .
DAVIS: There 's an unconfirmed report of a distress call made from a plane that crashed .
STUART: That 's really , really interesting , but
DAVIS: This call was supposedly made from a plane that crash landed . After it landed .
STUART: Sounds like they got it wrong . Next time you interrupt my work make sure it 's something I can use .
GABE: Come on we 're almost out .
QUALEN: You might say a few words for you friends this is the one that will ury them .
TRAVERS: What happened ?
QUALEN: I 'm not sure I set the timer
HAL: Gabe , it 's a dud But the second Hal transmits
GABE: Move !
QUALEN: When I was seventeen , I was a sentry on the East Berlin boundary . There was a problem , then too many defectors were managing to sneak through the wilderness to the west . A man would take them through , every night of every week a man like you friend . He had quite a sense of humor . Every time he got someone through , he 'd adio us at midnight to let us know how many . `` Five tonight . '' `` Eight more have been freed tonight . '' No one could find the route . It made me look ad . I looked day and night and finally I found it . A tunnel . I did n't tell me superiors . I put a charge there , with a timer to trigger a radio receiver on the detonator . At midnight . Our friend made his radio report , and I heard him say `` seven '' before the explosion . They pulled eight bodies out of the tunnel , and I was promoted to intelligence the next day .
TRAVERS: Thanks . We could n't have killed him without you .
GABE: Knock this in the side . Make it firm .
FRANK: Maggie come in , Maggie , this is Rescue One
TRAVERS: There 's our ride out of here . Everyone out of sight except you , Kristel . Make the distress call . You 're so good at it . All scramble up towards the clearing .
MAGGIE: What are we going to do ?
GABE: Die . I 'm sorry , Maggie . I 'm sorry you got into this .
MAGGIE: What are you doing ?
WRIGHT: He did n't think a distress call from a crashed plane was `` important '' ? Get me a fucking radio ! Now !
FRANK: Come in , Maggie , over
MAGGIE: Frank ! Down here ! Frank !
GABE: Forget about it . He ca n't hear you . Tie these together . Tight .
MAGGIE: Are you out of your mind
GABE: This is rope from the Gordon exhibit . The way guys climbed then , they 'd tie on three at a time this rope 'll take around nine hundred pounds .
MAGGIE: Gabe this rope is sixty years old
GABE: Yeah , they made it pretty good then . Each of these strands ought to hold about 300 pounds before snapping .
MAGGIE: Ought to . About . Will it hold ?
GABE: Depends on how big a breakfast you had . You want to go first ?
GABE: Swing towards it and drop !
FRANK: What the fuck
KRISTEL: What who are
FRANK: Do n't worry . I 'm here to help .
KRISTEL: Glad to hear it .
FRANK: Jailhouse load . First chamber 's empty the rest are n't . Forgive me , but things have been a little strange this morning .
TRAVER: Stop ! You 'll damage the helicopter .
TRAVERS: Answer that .
KRISTEL: Rocky Mountain Rescue One , over
STUART: This is Ross Stuart , Federal Aviation Administration please identify over
KRISTEL: Copy , FAA . This is Margaret Deighan , Rocky Mountain Rescue . Over
STUART: Please repeat , Rocky Mountain Rescue distress call was a false alarm ? over
TRAVERS: I almost believed you myself . Travers smiles and turns , looking at
TRAVERS: Time for number three . Unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere .
HAL: Fuck off .
TRAVERS: Suit yourself . You see , we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government one of whose members I know has zero imagination and I can tell you , the cavalry just is n't going to make it by this week . No , you 're taking us where we want to go . Because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch . You want to kill me more than anything , even more than you want to keep on breathing , and with a little more time you pray you 'll get that chance . Am I right ?
GABE: Are you okay ?
MAGGIE: My ears are ringing but I 'm all ight . Gabe , what 's going on ?
GABE: This . That plane crash it 's a half dozen guys who were smart enough to steal fifty million bucks , but dum enough to drop it all over the range . They 've got Hal as a bird dog and ight now they 're heading for the rest of it .
MAGGIE: Where ?
GABE: It 's close to the lake Hal 's probably leading them on the slowest possible route down to it . I can get there first all I have to do is make it along the north wall to the Bitker ladder
MAGGIE: `` All ? '' Jesus , Gabe what do you expect to do then ?
GABE: Something subtle .
MAGGIE: I 'm going with you .
GABE: No way . You 're climbing back down try to get to the station or find some help .
MAGGIE: I 'm just as good a climber as you are and right now , I 'm definitely in better shape .
GABE: And you 're definitely not going
MAGGIE: Anything you say , Gabe .
DAVIS: We 've tested the ash inside it 's the right paper .
WRIGHT: What about the men ?
DAVIS: It 's hard to tell . But forensics says yes . All of them were in the plane .
WRIGHT: Everything 's accounted for , then time to head back and start making excuses . Fifty million bucks up in smoke , and I just do n't give a shit . It 's one more un of the press . But we lost five good men and they are n't so easily eplaced . Especially a guy like Travers .
TRAVERS: Qualen . How far along are you ?
QUALEN: It looks like two miles , but
MAGGIE: Gabe ? I 'll go first .
GABE: If I do n't go first , I might not go at all .
MAGGIE: Gabe you 're going to get yourself killed
GABE: Maybe . But I 'm not getting you killed . Look , Maggie . I do n't know what 'll happen when I catch up with Hal but I 've got to know one thing for sure that you 're making it off this mountain . Alive .
MAGGIE: Okay .
GABE: Get on the trail and stay out of sight . I 'll see you on the ground .
WRIGHT: I give up . What was it ? A SEARCH PILOT zips the bag back up .
SEARCH PILOT: ID says this used to be your pilot . And we found him seven miles east of the wreck .
WRIGHT: A hijack . The plane was hijacked . Son of a itch
STUART: Oh , give me a break . Your pilot lost it when the flight started going south , and he bailed
SEARCH PILOT: Excuse me but there 's no parachute there . Check it yourself .
FORENSICS AGENT: Sir we found the flight recorder it was driven twenty feet deep into a crater . It was demolished , but we salvaged the recording
STUART: I 've heard a thousand of these , Wright whoever was at the stick is going to begin by screeching the Lord 's Prayer and wind up screaming `` Oh , shit '' at ground zero
WRIGHT: Guess we 're both right , Stuart . Thanks for your expertise . Well ? You 'll be waiting till Groundhog 's Day for him to pull his head out of his ass let 's get it in the air !
GABE: Has n't gotten any lower in the last year . Bitker , you cheap bastard . Would another four feet have killed you ?
DELMER: What about him ?
QUALEN: Kill him ! Now ! Delmer grins as he aims at Hal .
DELMER: Tell me where would you like the first half dozen shots to go ?
HAL: As long as you 're taking requests how about the base of your spine ?
QUALEN: Travers . Get down here . Now .
KRISTEL: You would have lived longer , if you were n't such a smartass .
GABE: Good thing for Qualen you are .
KRISTEL: What do you mean ?
GABE: When he comes back , he 's going to shoot you and the other guy , grab the money , and take off with Travers .
KRISTEL: No sale . Say `` night-night ''
GABE: He already blew up one of your pals in that crevice . And I 've been in that copter . It goes a hell of a lot farther with two people than with four . Am I wrong ? Give him a buzz . Kristel eases back with the gun .
KRISTEL: You 've got my attention .
GABE: You 've also got all the money . And I can show you how to get off the mountain with it . Right now .
TRAVERS: He 's hiding twenty yards in be careful .
TRAVERS: Something 's moving fast down the hill is it Tucker ?
KRISTEL: How much further ?
GABE: It 's right over there . Gabe nods ahead , indicating what looks like a
GABE: It 's a storage locker for the rangers . Everything you need to get off the mountain is in there skiis , food I 'll show you
KRISTEL: Do n't move .
GABE: We 'd make better time walking straight ahead . Qualen 's not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer .
KRISTEL: Right . So I 'd better have one less problem when he arrives .
GABE: Do n't fuck up . You still need me to show you a route off the mountain .
KRISTEL: You 've worn that one out , Walker I 'll find my own way down .
TRAVERS: Hop in . I know someone who 'd like to see you again before he dies .
GABE: Not any more .
QUALEN: Far more intimidating when it 's loaded .
GABE: Did n't care for the Smokey The Bea hats , either . That 's why I quit . You all right ?
HAL: I feel better than you look . I can live with that .
GABE: Hardly seems worth zipping , huh ? Frank ?
HAL: It 's not over , Gabe . Travers took the helicopter .
TRAVERS: Qualen Kristel come in
GABE: May I ? They ca n't talk right now , Travers . Kristel 's busy making snow angels and I 'm not sure , but I think Qualen is still falling . Any messages ? A moment 's silence then
TRAVERS: You wanted to make a trade earlier , Walker still interested ?
HAL: Now what ?
GABE: I have no fucking idea . Empty .
HAL: Not for long .
GABE: Why ca n't anything be easy ?
GABE: Stay over there
HAL: Look let me
GABE: what , throw snowballs at him ? Just whatever happens get Maggie out of here .
HAL: Count on it . And Gabe ? Thanks for tagging along .
GABE: Thanks for asking . I forgot how much I enjoyed rescue work .
GABE: Remember that bet you made ? About whether I could find the money for you or not ? You won .
TRAVERS: I 'll kill her
GABE: You do , and the spring thaw 's going to e worth thirty million bucks . No rush . I 'm sure you 've got lots of time .
TRAVERS: All right . Drop the gun first .
GABE: When she 's safe on the ground .
TRAVERS: Get out .
GABE: Run ! Run !
HAL: He 's going to run Gabe down
GABE: Cheer up . It 's a beautiful spot to die . Travers slides off and away
WRIGHT: I 'm no expert but what do you make of that `` event '' ?
HAL: Remember keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times
HAL: Jesus Christ you think you could have put a little less effort into that climb ? I mean , what have you done for me lately ?
MAGGIE: Does this mean you 're staying ? Off Gabe 's answering smile , we

STUMP: Yell 'bingo . '
REYNALDO: Okay , I got one A drunk is taking a piss in front of a bar , a bus drives by , real fast right along the curb , and knocks his thing off . Drunk picks up his thing , puts it in his pocket , goes into a bar , reaches into his pocket and puts his thing on the bar . 'Look't that , ' he says , 'bus knocked my thing off . ' Bartender says , 'that ai n't you thing that 's a cigar butt . '
FRANK: Amidst this levity , gentlemen , I have some real concerns . Mark my words , people will look back on this year and say that 1960 was the year that Western Civilization egan its downward trajectory .
BILL: You need to get laid , Frank .
FRANK: Guys , guys , c'mon do you really think things are as good as they used to be ? You think Jack Kennedy is qualified to be President ?
BILL: Kennedy may not be qualified , but Jackie 's a babe and that 's good enough for me .
REYNALDO: They 're a happily married couple and that oughta stand fo something these days Every man nods in solemn agreement .
MUD: Speaking of being happily married , Al , are you and your old lady still having problems ?

STUMP: I hear he 's got a way with kids
WILLIE: Fuck you , Mr. Cobb , I have too much dignity to spend another moment with you . I hope you die before the sun comes up and may you rot in hell !
STUMP: I 'm a writer .
WILLIE: You mean he actually found somebody to take the job ?
STUMP: Mr. Cobb ?
COBB: Yes , Mr. Stump you do need this job that bad .
COBB: On the violin Fritz Kreisler . I 'm a great admirer of his . I 'm also a great admirer of yours .
STUMP: Thank you .
COBB: But you are a hopeless romantic and only a moderate success .
STUMP: Sir , I am the most successful sportswriter in America and not merely a 'moderate success . '
COBB: Of course . Give me those pills over there .
COBB: That 's an invitation to a testimonial dinner at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown , New York . You 're taking me there when is it ?
STUMP: A few weeks .
COBB: All the great ones will be there The great Mickey Cochrane will be there ! Hornsby , Sisler , Ott , the Waner Brothers we used to have some parties , Stump , I 'll tell ya that right now We ca n't forget .
STUMP: I wo n't forget .
COBB: Look at me closely , Al Lie after lie has been written about me my whole life I 've een misunderstood . You 're gon na tell the real story of Ty Cobb .
STUMP: What 's the 'real ' story ?
COBB: That 's why you 're here . See , there 's two kinds of writers . The kind that spin endless yarns about small subjects that 's you .
COBB: Jameson ! Get your ass up here !
STUMP: You okay ?
COBB: Mmmmmm
COBB: There 's a small oil company nea Bakersfield called Honolulu Oil , sitting near the Elk Hills Reserve I want you to buy all the stock you can .
JAMESON: Honolulu Oil ?
COBB: Getty is expanding in the west , looking for companies like that . I got a hunch Stumpy , c'mere
STUMP: With a pistol ? No way .
COBB: There 's a board meeting of Coca-Cola in Georgia next week . Call them up and tell them I ca n't make it for medical personal reasons and sell all the 3-M stock we got .
STUMP: Like hell you did .
COBB: Right behind the ear .
STUMP: You 're full of shit .
COBB: Jameson ?
JAMESON: If Mr. Cobb said he got him , then he got him .
COBB: You have no vision , Stump . A writer without vision is a waste of my time . I think I picked the wrong man .
JAMESON: And I think I better get back to San Francisco before the storm hits . I 'll take care of these transactions , Mr. Cobb . And Jameson exits the room .
STUMP: And I 'll be leaving as well , sir , since you think I 'm the wrong man for the job .
COBB: Shut up , Stump we both know that I 'm your meal ticket . We need each other . And we start in the morning .
STUMP: No .
COBB: Yes .
STUMP: Ready , Mr. Cobb .
COBB: Chapter one , Page one
STUMP: I 'm ready .
COBB: 'Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day . ' Stump types it out , then stops .
STUMP: What the hell is that ?
COBB: That 's what Robert E. Lee said at the burial of my grandfather who was a Confederate General killed at Fredricksburg .
STUMP: So I 'm taking notes ?
COBB: Hell no . That 's the first line of my autobiography .
STUMP: I ai n't writing it .
COBB: Why not ?
STUMP: It 's horseshit . It 's a third person comment about someone who 's already dead . An autobiography has to be in the first person plus it ca n't come from the othe side of the God damn grave .
COBB: My story can come from any damn place I want .
STUMP: Not to mention you ca n't call yourself ' a prince and great man ' that 's for the world to decide .
COBB: What kind of a fucking writer you call yourself all tied up in ules and regulations . What 's the point being a writer if you ca n't say what you want to ?
STUMP: You 're not treating me like a writer you 're treating me like a stenographer .
COBB: It has a certain ring to it
STUMP: Yes it does .
COBB: I thought you might like it . It 's yours , a gift from me . 'Cobb , a prince among men , misunderstood in his genius , as genius always is ' - This is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of a great man ever written type it !
STUMP: You got a stock tip for me ?
COBB: Yeah buy Coca-Cola . We 're about to go out in cans .
STUMP: Coke in cans ? I do n't think so .
COBB: You know what 's wrong with Ty Cobb ?
STUMP: What ?
COBB: Every disease known to man I got 'em all ! And they 'll neve get me in a hospital never ! My heart leaks the doctors who are nothin ' but a buncha hacksaw artists give me Digoxin to keep it pumping
COBB: And if all that was n't enough , it 's been two years since I got my pecker in the air The South may not rise again but my dick will . The PHONE RINGS .
STUMP: Cobb 's residence hello . He 's not here who 's calling ? Ernie ? Ernie who ? My God It 's Ernest Hemingway for you .
COBB: Tell him to go to hell ! Stump covers the receiver nervously .
STUMP: Jesus Christ , Ty , this is the great American writer this is the man who inspired me to ecome a writer !
COBB: Tell him to go to hell anyway .
STUMP: Why ?
COBB: Him and me used to be pals but we went on a hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide .
STUMP: That 's it ? You did n't like a guide he hired ?
COBB: You tell him to go fuck himself or I 'll kick your Yankee ass !
STUMP: Mr. Hemingway ? Mr. Cobb says to go to hell . By the way I 'm a big fan of yours CLICK , a hang up .
COBB: Hemingway is n't a bullfighter he wrote about bullfighting . What the hell is that ? ! Bullshit Damn painkillers
STUMP: Ty , you okay ?
COBB: It 'll pass Stumpy , listen to me you know what I need ?
STUMP: What do you need ?
COBB: I need a woman . A woman is definitely what I need
STUMP: My God
COBB: We 're going to Reno . I want a woman .
STUMP: There 's a blizzard out there !
COBB: When a man wants a woman , a man wants a woman .
STUMP: Let 's just put on some soup , build a fire , and we can work on the ook .
COBB: How cozy . I got 25 thousand in cash and negotiable securities in here . Do n't let it out of your sight .
STUMP: Look , Ty , the roads are impassable .
COBB: You lead , I 'll follow .
STUMP: I 'm not driving in this stuff !
COBB: I need a woman !
COBB: Get off the road ya ca n't drive any faster ? ! Move it ! Stump is caught between fear and rage .
STUMP: Fuck you ! I ai n't dying in this God damn ice cube !
COBB: The man drives like an old woman
STUMP: Jesus
STUMP: Cobb !
COBB: It 's about fucking time you got here !
STUMP: You 've alive ?
COBB: I would n't call it living but it 'll do . Help me outta here .
STUMP: There 's blood !
COBB: Of course there 's blood ! I just put my head through the windshield of a car , what the hell ya think , ya big fucking jerk .
STUMP: Shut up !
COBB: Ty Cobb ca n't die like this ! They 'll bury me and nobody 'll know who it is !
STUMP: I said shut up .
COBB: Look't that ! No guard rail ! I 'm suing the State Highway Commission , I 'm suing the Governor , I 'm suing every God damn body ! I coulda been killed !
STUMP: God damn it , shut up and get in the car !
COBB: Gim me your keys , I 'm driving .
STUMP: I 'm driving .
COBB: Do you know how to get to Reno ? Hell , no ! I 'm driving .
STUMP: Over my dead body !
COBB: Your call .
STUMP: You miserable son of a bitch . You coward , you pathetic , frightened , desperate old man you ca n't do anything without that gun and frankly it does n't impress me to keep flashing it because I know you 're not gon na shoot me 'cause you need me worse than I need you . What , you 're gon na kill me ?
COBB: I 've killed a man .
STUMP: Fine , then put me outta my fuckin ' misery . I 'm freezing . Cobb hands the gun to Stump .
COBB: Here ya go , Stumpy . I like a man who stands up to me .
STUMP: Women ? Plural ?
COBB: Some for you , some for me . We 'll have a helluva time . The oads 're probably lining up right now , waiting for ol ' Ty and his uddy Stump .
STUMP: Dear God
COBB: I suppose you want to know about my childhood . Writers usually do .
STUMP: None of this 'know ye that a prince and great man has fallen ' stuff
COBB: My philosophy is simply this Life is too short to be diplomatic . A man 's friends should n't mind what he does o says , and those who are not his friends , well , to hell with 'em .
CONGREGATION: 'There is a fountain filled with lood , Drawn from Emmanuel 's veins '
COBB: My father died in a terrible accident , you know .
STUMP: No , I did n't , really
COBB: Did n't you do your research on me efore you came up here ?
STUMP: I did n't have time I mean , I knew the basics .
COBB: Then you 've read that I 'm the meanest bastard of them all ?
STUMP: People have said that , yes
COBB: I do n't care what people think .
STUMP: Then why do you care what I write ?
COBB: I am who I tell you I am ! Why are you making things so complicated ? !
STUMP: That 's what writers do .
COBB: Well writers oughta make things simple ! Everything 's complicated enough as it is .
STUMP: Maybe you 're right !
COBB: Of course I 'm right ! Stump suddenly looks up and shouts in terror .
STUMP: Ty !
COBB: Do n't shout like that , Stumpy it just increases my tension . I saw that truck all along you think I 'm gon na hit a truck when I 'm getting close to finding me some women ? Stump is in sheer terror by this time .
STUMP: Your father was murdered ?
COBB: I mean that 's the sort of thing you 're looking for , is n't it ? Murdered on the balcony of his own house the house I grew up in
STUMP: Your father was murdered ? How come nobody knows about this ?
COBB: The oldtimers in Royston know about it . Nobody else 's business . It happened when I was 17 , a few days before Detroit called me up .
STUMP: But this helps explain why He catches himself .
COBB: Why I 'm such a prick ? Ha ! That 's too easy you 're a etter writer than that
STUMP: Was the killer ever caught ?
COBB: There was an arrest , a trial , and an acquittal . Nobody was eve convicted .
STUMP: Jesus Christ
COBB: Aw , do n't go sob-sister on me , Stumpy . The only thing that finally matters is a man 's accomplishments and I must say , in all humility , Al , in all humility I was the greatest ballplayer of all time . Nobody is even a close second .
COBB: Single to left , steal second , steal third , steal home
GAMBLER: Eight to one .
COBB: Fuck you !
GAMBLER: Ten to one .
COBB: You 're on .
COBB: Who the hell ever signed you ?
TEAMMATE: Go to hell .

FAN #1: You 're a shit , Cobb !
FAN #2: I hate your guts , Cobb !
COBB: A good day to you , too , sir
COBB: After World War Two , General Patton asked me for an autograph he said he patterned himself after me ! Are you getting this ?
STUMP: I 'll remember .
COBB: Why are n't you writing ? !
STUMP: 'Cause I 'm trying to have a good grip on things when this car goes over the next cliff ! I ai n't eady to die yet !
COBB: But neither am I .
STUMP: Ty !
COBB: I said I 'm not ready to die .
STUMP: Then watch the fucking road .
COBB: But you 're not listening to me ! I may have every God damn disease known to man but I am never going to check into a hospital because I am alive and I am going to get laid in Reno !
STUMP: Maybe I do n't wanta get laid !
COBB: You queer ? !
STUMP: I 'm married .
COBB: I thought you were divorced .
STUMP: We 're in the middle of a problem . We 're talking .
COBB: Talking my ass ! Quit hanging on get a divorce . Is that why you do n't wanta get laid in Reno ? 'Cause you 're feeling loyal to a woman you 're divorcing ? That 's eally stupid , Stumpy
STUMP: I 'm not getting a divorce . I 'm eing loyal .
COBB: Is that why you used to wine and dine that little brunette who had an office across the courtyard from you in Santa Barbara ? Stump is nailed .
STUMP: What do you know about her ? !
COBB: I do my homework , Stumpy . I know where the bodies are buried .
STUMP: It did n't last long !
COBB: Hey , no need to defend yourself . When it comes to women I 'm a total shit the difference is , Stumpy , that I know I 'm a shit .
STUMP: Nobody knows about the brunette .
COBB: Our little secret , huh ? And that part about me being a shit with women ? That ai n't gon na e in the book .
STUMP: I got ta put your family in my ook .
COBB: Your book ? ! My book ! And nothing about my ex-wives or children are gon na be in it . My book is about aseball !

STUMP: Ty , it 's Willie . We can give him a lift to town .
COBB: Bullshit ! I ai n't givin ' no nigger a ride nowhere !
STUMP: Shut the fuck up and give him a ide !
COBB: Now who 's the coward ! You wo n't shoot me ! You need me ! Stump hands the gun to Willie..
STUMP: No . But I 'm sure Willie would take great pleasure in it .
COBB: You 'll pay for this , Stumpy
STUMP: Say , Willie , you a baseball fan ?
WILLIE: Yessir
STUMP: Who 's the greatest ballplayer of all time , in your opinion ?
WILLIE: Willie Mays , no doubt about it .
COBB: That nigger could n't hold my jock !
STUMP: Excuse me , Mr. Cobb , the man is speaking
WILLIE: And I 'd say the second greatest player of all time is Jackie Robinson or maybe Josh Gibson
COBB: Shut up ! !
WILLIE: And of course , the greatest base unner of all time is n't riding in this car the fastest baseball player of all time was Cool Papa Bell Cool Papa would 've easily oke all your stolen base ecords
COBB: Noooooo !
WILLIE: Cool Papa was so fast that when he entered a hotel room and flipped the light switch off , he 'd be asleep in bed before it got dark
STUMP: And then there 's Satchel Paige
WILLIE: Oh yeah , Satchel Paige could throw a porkchop past a wolf , Mr. Cobb , ol ' Satchel woulda had you eatin ' outta his hand , he woulda had you hittin ' .220 and kissin ' his black ass to boot

STUMP: I 'm entitled to my opinions
COBB: Now that 's pathetic . Who gives a good God damn about the opinions of Al Stump ? ! What people want to know about is Ty Cobb ! And they do n't want to know who he hates 'cause everybody hates somebody ! They do n't wanta know if he had two wives or ten ! They do n't wanta know if he hit women or if they hit him !
STUMP: You think they wanta know how to steal second base ?

COBB: Oh , oh , oh I get it . You 're one of them college psychology type guys . You wanta find the missing piece to finish the puzzle known as the Madman Cobb you think you 're the next Hemingway ut you 're just a moderate success in a moderate-sized pond .

STUMP: No , I do . I always have it .
COBB: Did you read your contract ?
STUMP: It 's my standard contract . I just signed . I would never have agreed to this if you had final approval .
COBB: Call your agent . Stump quickly dials and gets an answer .
STUMP: Hello ? Charlie ? Al I 'm in Reno yeah things are fine Yeah , listen I 'm just checking did we give away final editorial approval on this Cobb book ? We did ? Cobb has it ? Jesus
COBB: Well , you were pretty stupid to give up approval , were n't ya ?
STUMP: Fuck you , Cobb ?
COBB: Fuck me ? Why me ? Why you mad at me ? Your agent made the deal , your lawyer , you publisher , you did n't even read the contract because you trusted them ! Who the hell ever trusted a lawyer or an agent ? ! If I was Al Stump , the guy I 'd be pissed off at would be Al Stump !
STUMP: Listen to me , you son of a bitch if you die before the book is finished , I 'll write the story I want .

BACK ONSTAGE: As Cobb arrives
LOUIS PRIMA: My great pleasure , sir I 've always wanted to ask you something , Mr. Cobb , with all the great ballplayers playing right now how well do you think you 'd do against today 's players ?
COBB: Well , I figure against today 's pitchers I 'd only hit about .275 ,
LOUIS PRIMA: That 's amazing , Mr. Cobb , considering your lifetime average is nearly a hundred points higher . Why do you think you 'd only hit .275 against today 's pitchers ?
COBB: Because I 'm 72 fucking years old , that 's why , God damn it . Give me that thing . Cobb grabs the mike and takes over .
LOUIS PRIMA: Thank you very much . Anothe ound of applause for the Georgia Peach , Ty Cobb !
COBB: I got the mike , Dago gim me a God damn minute . Nobody 's got espect for their elders any more .
COBB: Now let me explain to you how to hit a baseball . It 's a lost art . Ever since that half-nigger Ruth started hitting home runs , the skill , the art , and the science have been lost .
CASINO MANAGER: Let 's just haul him off
SECURITY OFFICER: That 's Ty Cobb ! He 'll fucking kill me !
COBB: You see , the bat is like a wand , a magic wand it should be caressed , held like a woman like a woman who 's really in need of a man
OFFSTAGE: The Casino Manager winces and consults .
CASINO MANAGER: Oh God , here we go
COBB: Hitting a baseball is really very easy you ca n't force it you ca n't overpower it you go with the pitch you let the bat do the work it 's all rhythm and flow
STUMP: Excuse me .

COBB: Take me back to the Hall !
STUMP: I appreciate your coming .
CHARLES: For Mr. Cobb , no problem . Cobb is silent . He and Stump enter .
COBB: What did you see on that film tonight ?
STUMP: I saw Ty Cobb playing baseball .
COBB: That 's all ?
STUMP: That 's all .
COBB: I was raised in the Baptist Church ut I know that Heaven is just the ol ' oskefagus the change-up . You swing from your ass 'cause you think life is a fastball down the middle and after your bat has crossed the plate and you 're all off balance and looking stupid , the ball just kinda flutters across home , slow and juicy and hittable , and as it crosses the plate , the ball looks at you and smiles a nasty smile and laughs its way into the catcher 's mitt We do n't just lose we 're made fools of .
STUMP: You were the best .
COBB: Save the romance for the book and take me home to Georgia .
COBB: Greatest biography ever written
COBB: About fifteen years ago . But she understands me There ! No damn .
STUMP: I 'll see if it 's her . Wait here .
FLORENCE: That 's me .
STUMP: I have your brother in the car .
FLORENCE: Tyrus ?
STUMP: Yes . And he 'd like to see you .
FLORENCE: I do n't wish to see him .
STUMP: It 's been a long time , he said . He 's not well .
FLORENCE: I have nothing to say to him , and wish to hear nothing he has to say to me .
STUMP: I know there 's been problems , but the family is very important to him .
FLORENCE: Young man , the family he talks about never existed .
STUMP: He loved his father .
FLORENCE: If his father , if my father , was such a great man , why did Tyrus turn out to be so evil ?
STUMP: He 's dying . He just wants to see you .
FLORENCE: No .
COBB: Well ?
STUMP: It was n't your sister . The woman in the house said your sister moved a long time ago she does n't know where .
COBB: You cocksucking liar . My siste does n't want to see me and you 're lying . And Stump , at last , goes off
STUMP: Liar ? ! A cocksucking liar ? ! Of course I 'm a liar ! That 's what I 'm paid to do , is n't it ? ! Lie about Ty Cobb ? !
COBB: If you did n't like the job , why did n't you quit ?
STUMP: Who would take care of you ?
COBB: Do n't give me the sob-siste outine .
STUMP: I listen to your bullshit , I interpret and shape and find words for your bullshit and you give me nothing but grief !
COBB: You love being this close to greatness !
STUMP: Stop the car !
COBB: I will , Stumpy , I will
STUMP: And go to hell !
COBB: Oh , I 'll do that , too . And look how convenient you 've made it .
STUMP: That was your sister alright , and she did n't want anything to do with you either !
COBB: I forgive her .
STUMP: You forgive her ? ! That 's rich !
COBB: Forgiveness is crucial to human maturity and religious growth .
STUMP: Religious growth ? !
COBB: We all need to forgive more , Al you oughta try it . You 're too angry . You 're all pent up .
STUMP: I 'm angry ?
COBB: Are you angry because I discovered you were a whore ? Is that it , Alimony ?
STUMP: I 'm angry ? !
COBB: Is it the divorce ? You got ta let go of it
STUMP: I love her ! I do n't want a divorce !
COBB: Sure ya do . You 're just so used to accommodating people that you do n't know what you want anymore . I accommodate nobody .
STUMP: But you have no friends !
COBB: Do you ? Who are they ? ! Those drunken hacks you hang out with who all think they 're gon na write the great American novel but all they 're gon na ever do is bitch and moan and write lousy leads about high school football games ? How about the brunette in the courtyard ? Is she your friend ? I heard she fucks everybody she must be everybody 's friend !
STUMP: Which Cobb of Georgia is that ?
COBB: That is me .
COBB: When I die , my mother and fathe will be moved in here and , in time , my dear sister , Florence will join us as well . The family will be together again . Stump is still fuming , angry and cynical .
STUMP: Under one roof ? That 's romantic ! You want that in the book ? Ty Cobb brings the family together at last to enter the gates of Heaven whole !
COBB: You mock my family you mock me .
STUMP: Then why are you such a bastard ?
COBB: Being a bastard is a small price to pay for greatness . I , too , am a great man .
STUMP: Let me go !
COBB: My mother did n't kill my father .
STUMP: What 're you talking about ?
COBB: My father told my mother he was leaving town for the weekend but he came back to the edge of the woods where he tied up his horse
COBB: Well ? ! Is that what you want ? ! 'Cause that 's all I know and the only other people who know about it are dead ! But it ai n't going in the book , either , 'cause you 're the only friend I got left , and you 're the only man I can trust . Cobb lets Stump go , relaxing his grip and
STUMP: I do n't want to be your friend ! I do n't want to feel sorry for you ! So your mother 's lover blew you father 's head off ! I do n't care . You were a prick before it happened , you were a prick after it happened , you 've been a prick eve since , and you 're a prick now !
COBB: Public relations are overrated .
STUMP: What the hell 're you talking about ? Cobb holds out his flask for Stump .
COBB: You need a drink .
STUMP: Fuck the drink !
COBB: You 're too angry , Al , you just got ta learn to let it out .
STUMP: I 'm gon na tell the truth about you , Cobb ! I 'm gon na tell the world you hate women , Jews , and niggers !
COBB: You should n't use the word 'nigger ' , Stumpy , it 's racist and demeaning . And I do n't hate women I 'm just not very good with 'em , which puts me in the same boat with you and every other man I know .
STUMP: You treat people like dirt ! Cobb comes out into the rain toward Stump .
COBB: The children of America need heroes , Al , you know that
STUMP: Get your hands off me !
COBB: C'mon , Al You 're making a fool of yourself out here . It 's not dignified Come in out of the rain
COBB: Either my father was inadequate for my mother he was not the man I thought he was not a great man not even a good man or my mother was trash a common whore It 's that simple , is n't it ? Stump just shrugs and takes another hit .
STUMP: A man must defend his mothe at all times .
COBB: That 's what I thought
STUMP: Papers ?
COBB: I 'm afraid it 's divorce , Stumpy . I know this routine .
STUMP: But my wife and I are still talking ? !
COBB: Yeah , and what she 's saying is 'fuck you . '
STUMP: Fuck me ? Well fuck her . No , fuck him .
COBB: We all loved our wives , Al , that 's got nothing to do with it .
COBB: There 's a million broads out there , Stumpy put down the gun .
STUMP: I am not going to accommodate this man , Tyrus .
COBB: You 're all mixed up . Give me the gun .
STUMP: You 're absolutely right , Tyrus , I 've been accommodating people my whole life and it stops right here . You 've killed a man . I 'll kill a man . KABLAM ! KABLAM ! He misses again .
COBB: Al no Al Al
STUMP: Life is too short to be diplomatic . A man 's friends do n't care what he says or does . You 're my friend , Ty , right ? You 're my friend !
COBB: No ! Stump pulls the TRIGGER CLICK . Empty .
STUMP: I almost killed a man .
COBB: A little drunken excess
STUMP: No . I put a gun to a man 's head and pulled the trigger . I wanted to kill him .
COBB: It 's forgotten already . I saw nothing . Nothing happened .
STUMP: Yes it did .
COBB: Al , listen to me .
STUMP: Nobody 's gon na write my iography .
COBB: And when the brunette in the courtyard brushed against you , I know what happened , Al . A warm summer breeze , the smell of jasmine , her black hair against a white blouse you came to life again , you got hard and when you saw her naked it was more than you could bear it 's okay , Al , it 's okay The brunette ai n't gon na be in the book either
STUMP: I get it I get it A moment . A look .
COBB: Then get some sleep . You look pathetic .
COBB: 'vicious , pathological , ubbling with violence Cobb 's demons were not merely exorcized on the baseball field they spilled over into all parts of his miserable life '
COBB: You do n't have a point of view , Stumpy , you ai n't worth killing
COBB: No no no this ca n't e Absolutely not This is not right
COBB: Can you get me the Emory Hospital ? Hello , Ma'am ? This is Ty Cobb . Can you please prepare you finest room for me ? Tomorrow morning would be fine .
STUMP: Ty . Tyrus . Peach Stump struggles to his elbow to find Cobb .
STUMP: I 'm here to see
STUMP: Mr. Cobb .
RECEPTIONIST: Be careful . He 's got a gun and we have n't been able to get it away from him .
STUMP: I know , I know

NURSE #1: Excuse me , sir , but I need to draw some more blood .

NURSE #2: A Mr. Barton is here to see you . He says he 's the chairman of the oard of Coca Cola .
COBB: Tell the son of a bitch to go downstairs and have a Pepsi I got no time for business .
YOUNG DOCTOR: I need to take your blood pressure , sir .

YOUNG DOCTOR: I have to do it .
OLDER DOCTOR: Mr. Cobb . We can not allow you to have a gun in here .
COBB: Come and get it .
STUMP: I do n't know which version of you life I 'm going to publish . I eally do n't .
COBB: There ya go again ! Accommodating me and you do n't have to ! I died faster than you could write !
STUMP: I did n't know what I was getting into with this job .
COBB: Quit explaining yourself ! Stand y your convictions ! You beat the great Ty Cobb ! I respect that ! But if you print it print it all ! My second son weighed 300 pounds and he died of a heart attack in the arms of a hooker in Paso Robles . My other son I lost all track of and my two daughters wo n't speak to me and my two ex- wives wo n't and my siter you know wo n't ! Print it all ! And Ty Cobb ca n't get it up anymore ! Print that too !
STUMP: It 's all confusing
COBB: It 's not ! It 's simple ! You won ! Tell the world that the greatest allplayer who ever lived was also the biggest bastard ! Who cares now ? ! I give you permission and my blessing ! From here on it 's your story !
STUMP: Here 's a little something might help . Cobb nods in appreciation .
COBB: Where 's my money ?
STUMP: Right here , Peach next to you gun . Cobb grabs Stump 's hand for one last word .
COBB: Stumpy , there 's nothing wrong with wanting glory . Now get the hell outta here .
OLDER DOCTOR: What about the gun ? Did you get it ?
STUMP: Naw , I did n't get the gun

MAMÁ IMELDA: This nonsense ends now , Miguel ! I am giving you my blessing and you are going home !
MIGUEL: I do n't want your blessing !
MAMÁ IMELDA: Miguel ! Stop !
MIGUEL: You 're ruining my life !
MAMÁ IMELDA: What ?
MIGUEL: Music 's the only thing that makes me happy . And you , you wan na take that away ! You 'll never understand . Miguel heads away from her up the stairs .
MIGUEL: I thought you hated music .
MAMÁ IMELDA: Oh , I loved it . I remember that feeling , when my husband would play , and I would sing and nothing else mattered . But when we had Coco , suddenly there was something in my life that mattered more than music . I wanted to put down roots . He wanted to play for the world .
MIGUEL: But I do n't wan na pick sides ! Why ca n't you be on MY side ? That 's what family 's supposed to do support you . But you never will .

MIGUEL: I just met him tonight . He told me he knew you
HÉCTOR: Please Miguel , put my photo up .
MIGUEL: W-What ?

HÉCTOR: Imelda
MAMÁ IMELDA: I want nothing to do with you . Not in life , not in death ! I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes . He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole ! Miguel steps between Imelda and Héctor .
MIGUEL: I was n't in there ` cause of Héctor . He was in there ` cause of me . He was just trying to get me home I did n't wan na listen , but he was right nothing is more important than family .
MAMÁ IMELDA: What ?
MIGUEL: So he can see Coco again . Hécto should be on our ofrenda . He 's part of our family
MAMÁ IMELDA: He left this family !
MIGUEL: He tried to go home to you and Coco but de la Cruz murdered him !
HÉCTOR: It 's true , Imelda . Imelda wrestles with her emotions .

EDDIE: Tell the truth .
KOSALAS: See . It 's all so nothin ' for you . If I talk straight every cop on the force will shit on me . If I do n't Cragie gets away with murder .
EDDIE: And the chance to do it again . Next time he might take away a cop . That make any difference ?
KOSALAS: He 's my partner .
EDDIE: Your partner 's selling you out , Kosalas . He kills an unarmed kid , and now he 's risking your ass to save his own .
KOSALAS: It was a mistake .
EDDIE: It cost an innocent kid his life .
KOSALAS: I know that ! I KNOW THAT ! He is too loud , and attracts attention .
EDDIE: Tell 'em like it is , Nick . I 'll back you up . Eddie gets up and walks away .
CRAGIE: Nice to see you out with the boys for a change , Sarge .

CRAGIE: Fuck you . Where do you get off ?
EDDIE: Right about here . Eddie walks out the door .
PIRELLI: She 's havin ' a bad night . Gave her a shot of brandy . Maybe she 'll sleep .
EDDIE: Giving liquor to a minor , Pirelli ? He turns to leave .
DIANA: What do you do when you do n't have anyone ?
EDDIE: You find someone . She looks up at him .
DIANA: Could you Hold me for a while ?
CLERK: In the next doorway . Four meters .
DONATO: How you doin ' , Sarge ?
EDDIE: What 's the score ?
DONATO: Kid 's grandmother says Cragie threw down the pistola .
PARTIDA: Officer Cragie has already been sworn . Officer Cragie , you have heard Mrs. Murillio 's testimony
CRAGIE: Yes , sir .
PARTIDA: You have heard her tell this panel that she saw you lay the gun in he grandson 's hand . He feigns compassion .
CRAGIE: I 'm not saying the woman would make this up . But there 's no way she could have seen anything from where she was standing in a hallway that dark . Like you said , she 's the boy 's grandmother .
PARTIDA: If it was dark , Officer , how were you sure Vega had a gun ?
CRAGIE: We were lucky . There was a glint of light , a reflection comin off the arrel of the weapon .
DONATO: You think he 'll get a pass ?
EDDIE: You heard it all . What do you think ?
DONATO: If the hearing was over I 'd have to put my money on the old lady . But Kosalas 's next . My bet 's on Cragie .
EDDIE: The kid may surprise you .
PARTIDA: And right after you heard Office Cragie 's gun discharge , what did you do then ?
KOSALAS: I immediately advanced down the hall .
PARTIDA: And what did you see ?
KOSALAS: The deceased , Vega , lying on the floor . Officer Cragie was checking his vital signs .
PARTIDA: What happened then ?
KOSALAS: We recovered a .25 calibre automatic from the teenager 's right hand .
PARTIDA: Did you see that weapon in Vega 's hand before Officer Cragie fired ?
KOSALAS: Yes , sir . Cragie leans back .
PARTIDA: No more questions .
DIANA: You made that uniform look good . Pirelli looks up .
PIRELLI: That good looking gorilla next to me is Eddie 's father . Better than good cop . Killed in the line of duty .
EDDIE: I ca n't comment on that . It was ove efore I got there .
PARTIDA: You are his superior officer , are you not ?
EDDIE: Cragie 's in my unit , yes .
PARTIDA: Did you give the men their various assignments ?
EDDIE: I did .
PARTIDA: Did you request that officer Cragie e on your TAC team ?
EDDIE: No , I did n't . Partida lifts a document from the table .
PARTIDA: Sergeant I have here a department document dated 24 September , of last year . It is a request by you , to your superiors , to have Officer Cragie transferred to another unit . Are you familiar with this document ?
EDDIE: Yes . The room listens to every word .
PARTIDA: Why did you request his transfer ?
EDDIE: Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone to look at the city 's guts , Mr. Partida .
PARTIDA: What happened to this request ?
EDDIE: It was denied . Partida lifts another document .
PARTIDA: This is a letter of support fo Officer Cragie . Everyone in his unit signed it but you . Why ?
EDDIE: I do n't agree with what it says .
PARTIDA: Are you saying you do not believe Officer Cragie is fit to work the streets of Chicago ?
EDDIE: That 's what I 'm saying .
BRENNAN: Seems to me the man 's got his tongue stuck to his asshole , Cragie .
CRAGIE: Hey , that do n't bother him . He 's the fuckin White Knight . You wan na take on the whole world by yourself ? Now you 're gon na get you chance , Sarge . They walk down the hall .
COP: He was a friend of yours was n't he ?

DEGAS: He 's coming here . He 's on his way .
DISPATCHER: We need a verification on a back-up for Unit 1462
SECOND DISPATCHER: 1462 . That 's Cusack , right ? First dispatcher nods .
LUIS: Take him apart .

CRAGIE: You little fuckin ' bastard !
KOSALAS: What 's this for partner ? Your next fuck up ? Kates steps in and separates them .
KATES: Get someone in the air . We 're gon na find Cusack .
LUIS: Take off the gag . I want them to hear her .
EDDIE: Here we go partner .

BUTCHER: How 's the lemonade ? Sweet ?
SALLY: That 's a fine looking thing .
ADA: I 've been missing it .
SALLY: Thank you , by the way . Inman 's down in the bottom field , clearing his debt .
ADA: Oh dear . And then he had nothing to say .
SALLY: He was happy .
ADA: Really ?
SALLY: Are men so different in Charleston ?
ADA: Men ? I do n't know . I do n't even know what a woman should be like . In Charleston I was called a thistle , twice , by two different men . Both of them they were hunting for a simile , what was I like and thistle came right to them .
SALLY: If you 're saying you might like him , why not go down and say hello .
MONROE: Esco , our friends there they helped build the Chapel ?
ESCO: That 's Teague and his boys . I 'd ecommend you kick them out except a man do n't kick a snake . One time the Teague family owned the whole of Cold Mountain . My farm , your farm , all belonged to his grand-daddy . Teague wanted this place bad . You got it . He 's here sniffing out an advantage .
MONROE: There 's no advantage here , but to celebrate a job well done . Cheers and thank you . And Teague raises his glass across the room .

INMAN: I 'm wetter than a fish .
ADA: There 's a good fire going .
INMAN: I 'm all right .

MONROE: You must come in .
INMAN: I should probably get along .
ADA: Mr. Inman is more comfortable outdoors . Perhaps we might take a walk .
MONROE: A splendid idea .
INMAN: I think so .
MONROE: It 's a special view . I dragged my poor daughter to Cold Mountain from Charleston because of my Doctors they say my heart is weak so the air 's meant to do me good . But it 's the view I think heals .
ADA: Well , you have your war .
TEAGUE: Those who follow Lincoln , or preach abolition , best keep one eye open when they 're sleeping , Old Bogey Man might get you !
INMAN: Are you the law all of a sudden ?
TEAGUE: That 's right , son . Home Guard fo Haywood County . I 'm the law from today . You all go fight now . We 'll watch your sweethearts .
INMAN: You might be safer back in Charleston .
ADA: But then who 'll be waiting for you ?
INMAN: I 'm going to walk back inside the Chapel .
MONROE: Did you want a quiet word ?
INMAN: Just some quiet .
MONROE: Of course Ada .
ADA: And then there 'll be a coffee o two , a brandy or two
INMAN: Ada
ADA: What ?
ROURKE: Let 's go !
INMAN: I 'm not dying .
STOBROD: What 'd he say ?
PANGLE: Says he ai n't about to die .
STOBROD: Truth to tell they say you are , Soldier . We 'll meet again , in the etter world .
TEAGUE: My condolences to you all . Keep an eye on the negro . They want what the white man got all of you watch out your brave boys give thei lives to war and meantime your slaves carry murder , rape and arson to you firesides .
MONROE: The only slaves within twenty miles labor on my farm . They 're good Christians and I 'll vouchsafe fo them .
ADA: What ?
MONROE: You 're looking at this moment , I do n't know why you 're looking exactly like your mother .
ADA: Every time you see the doctor you get melancholy .
MONROE: He listens to my heart and I get emotional .
ADA: He gives you alcohol and you get emotional . She squeezes his arm .
MONROE: We commiserate about the folly of this terrible war . Do you worry when there 's no word from him ? From Mr. Inman ?
ADA: Yes . But then I 've tried counting the number of words which passed etween Mr. Inman and me . Is that a bonfire ? So close to the arns .
MONROE: Hey ! Stop there ! Hey !
ADA: No , Daddy , it 's not real .
MONROE: What is wrong with us all ? Ada turns and runs off .
ADA: I 'll get help . Keep away from the flames .
DOCTOR: Most of these men will be dead by the morning or , if they 're stubborn , y nightfall . I have other men outside in the quadrangle waiting for the eds . The women try to process this , the attitude .
MRS. MORGAN: I 'm sorry , you want water ?
INMAN: Pigeon River . Little East Fork . The Doctor is on his exit , stops at the bed .
MRS. MORGAN: I 'm sorry . I do n't know what he 's saying .
DOCTOR: They ramble . Names of loved ones .
MRS. MORGAN: Pigeon River . Is that a place ? Cold Mountain ?
DOCTOR: This man is dead .
MONROE: Thank you . For your Providence , Oh lord , we thank you .
ADA: Amen . That was the last of the ham .
MONROE: It was delicious .
ADA: I have to learn how to cook .
MONROE: I was going to say something in Chapel . Perhaps some of the womenfolk will volunteer .
ADA: I ca n't have people coming here and cooking for me !
MONROE: It 's my fault . I should have raised you less like a companion and more like a young woman . I 'm sorry .
ADA: I 'm not sorry , but I do n't know how we 'll get through another winter .
MONROE: Will you play me something ? Something peaceful while I look over my sermon .
ADA: Daddy , bring the tablecloth in with you !
MRS. MORGAN: It 's come to you by way of Virginia . There are various dates , which she decodes .
OFFICIAL: Any man takes in a deserter is likewise guilty of treason .
ADA: Is there a letter for me ?
MRS. CASTLEREAGH: Nothing we 're getting no post through at all although if you slip out back the material you ordered has arrived .
ADA: I know . Thank you so much .
MRS. CASTLEREAGH: The sooner we lose this war the etter . Already one boy gone , anothe with his leg took off at the knee . That 's enough .
ADA: What do you hear ?
MRS. CASTLEREAGH: All I know is they say not one boy in ten from these mountains is coming home again and most of them are deserters .
TEAGUE: It 's taken me too long , but I 've come to pay my respects .
ADA: Thank you .
TEAGUE: I reckoned you might need fattening up .
ADA: Did n't somebody try ?
TEAGUE: Lot to manage without help . Need a hand with that pump ?
ADA: No .
TEAGUE: I 'm happy to volunteer .
ADA: But not to volunteer for the war ?
TEAGUE: The war ? I wanted to go . But you know too old , too literate . Plus I got no spleen . Lost it from a horse 's kick .
ADA: You 've got no spleen .
TEAGUE: That 's the thing about an organ . You do n't know you need it till you lost it . I want to clear this path . I can just as soon do it and talk as stand around and talk . Then you can say men beat a path to your door .
ADA: I 'd really prefer it if you did n't do that .
TEAGUE: Would you rather I did my job ? See if there 's any material I should confiscate . For the war effort .
ADA: I was raised in the good manners of the South where a gentleman does n't enter a house with a woman alone .
TEAGUE: Good manners did n't quite make it to these mountains . If it do n't yield meat , or you ca n't sit on it , o suck on it And you 're sleeping all right ? These cold dark nights ?
ADA: I 'm sleeping fine .
TEAGUE: It 's going to be a long hard winter .
SALLY: Ada ! Ada , It 's Sally .
ESCO: Will you look at the state of this place !
SALLY: Poor soul . She 's got nobody and nothing and three hundred acres of misery .
BLIND MAN: Getting better all the time .
INMAN: Seems that way .
BLIND MAN: I would n't hurry . War 's almost done .
INMAN: Where 'd you take your wound ?
BLIND MAN: Before I was born . Never saw a thing in this world , not a tree a gun or a woman . Though I put my hand on all three . Couple of things I felt back there I 'd sure liked to have had a long look at .
INMAN: What would you give for that ? To have your eyeballs back for ten minutes ?
BLIND MAN: Ten minutes ! Would n't give an Indian head cent . I fear it might turn me hateful .
INMAN: That 's sure what seeing 's done to me .
BLIND MAN: That ai n't the way I meant it . You said ten minutes . It 's having a thing and then the loss I 'm talking about .
INMAN: Then we do n't agree . There 's not much I would n't give for ten minutes of someplace .
BLIND MAN: Someplace or someone .
INMAN: Same difference .
BLIND MAN: You watch yourself . They 're shooting men who take themselves a walk .
BARBER: Next .
SALLY: You 're skinny as a whippet , girl you 're coming indoors with me .

ADA: There are no people . And no money . My father had some bonds and investments . They 're worthless now , of course , the war has they 're not worth anything . I love it here . In spite of everything .
ESCO: And waiting on a feller . A look from Sally .
SALLY: I know it ai n't rightly Christian , ut it 's what folks do , like when they dangle a needle over the belly to see if you 're carrying a boy or a girl .
ADA: What kind of mirror ?
ESCO: See anything ?
ADA: I do n't know .
SALLY: I tried many a time , never saw a dickybird .

RUBY: What 's the rake for ?
ADA: The rake ?

RUBY: Am I hard to hear cause you keep epeating everything . I 'm not looking for money , never cared for it and now it ai n't worth nothing . I expect to board and eat at the same table . I 'm not a servant . Do you get my meaning ?
ADA: You 're not a servant .
RUBY: People 'll have to empty their own night jars , that 's my point .
ADA: Right .
RUBY: And I 'm not planning to work while you watch neither .
ADA: Right .

ADA: Actually , yes , I think we do .
INMAN: Do n't let go . Just back up , nice and steady , do this all in reverse , you 're going to end up with her draped back over your animal .
VEASEY: Do n't pull that trigger . I am a man of God .
INMAN: I 've killed several of them .
VEASEY: I mean I am God 's minister .
INMAN: What part of God 's business is throwing a woman down a gorge .
VEASEY: A slave woman , can you see that in this light ? She 's black as a bucket of tar .
INMAN: Is she dead ?
VEASEY: Drugged her . Like you would a utterfly . And I care for her , that 's the heartbreak of it .
INMAN: Where does she live ?
VEASEY: In our house . She sleeps in ou kitchen . You do n't know me , friend , ut the good Lord punished me with want . I am all appetite . That 's all I do all day is want food , the female parts
INMAN: Shut your mouth . I do n't want a sermon every time I ask a question .
VEASEY: Dear God of misery .
INMAN: You 're going to put her back where she sleeps .
VEASEY: I do that the Members will lynch me . Consorting with a nigger , adultery , siring a bastard while serving as their preacher . We 're a strict congregation we 've churched men fo picking up a fiddle on the sabbath .
INMAN: So you reckoned to kill her .
VEASEY: There 's a back door . Have pity . And he leads Inman down a side path .
VESEY: You tasted dark meat ? Sweet as liquorice . I think I should go back up to my wife . She wakes at the slightest noise .
INMAN: You find me some paper and a pen .
VEASEY: You 're not entitled to judge me ! You 're nothing but an outlier , plain as daylight !
RUBY: Morning . Pigs you have any loose in the woods ?
ADA: No . What ? No . We bought our hams .
RUBY: There 's a world more to a hog than the two hams ! Lard , for example , we 'll need plenty
ADA: I do n't know . Locust ?
RUBY: Where 's North ?
ADA: North is , North is
RUBY: Name me three herbs growing wild on this farm .
ADA: I ca n't ! I ca n't ! All right ? I can talk about farming in Latin . Will that do ? I can read French . I know Harmony and Counterpoint . I know my Bible . I can name the principal rivers of Europe , but do n't ask me to name one stream in this county . I can embroider , but I ca n't darn , I can arrange cut flowers , but I ca n't grow them . If a thing has a function , if I might do something with it , it was n't considered suitable .
RUBY: Why ?
ADA: Ruby , you could ask why ? about pretty much everything to do with me .
RUBY: So you never wrapped your legs around this Inman ? An old-fashioned look from Ada
FERRYGIRL: For five dollars I would n't give a parched man a dipper of this iverwater .

VEASEY: I 'm not looking for revenge , by the way . For what you did to me . No , I 'm a Pilgrim now , like you , traveling the road , paying our dues , relying on the kindness of strangers .
INMAN: You 're nothing like me and the last thing I want right now is a conversation .
VEASEY: You recall Job in the scriptures ? I will give free utterance to my complaint . I will speak in the itterness of my soul . That 's ou friend here They cut off my hair . Which was hard . I was vain about my hair . I had good curls . But I deserved it . I 'm the Reverend Veasey . Have I seen you in church ?
FERRYGIRL: I 'm saving for a cowhide , and when I get it I aim to get a saddle made , and when I get me a saddle I 'll save for a horse , and when I got a horse I 'll throw on the saddle , and then you wo n't see my sorry ass round this swamp again .
VEASEY: What 's that ?

ADA: And your mother ?
RUBY: Never met her . We 're the same in that regard . He said she was he told me a thousand stories she was a wolf or an indian or a donkey . Do n't say much for him , except you know he 'd be fast to work up a sweat on a tree if he thought there was pleasure in it .
VEASEY: Used to be as regular as morning prayers . Matter of fact I could set my watch by my bowels . That beeswax you fed me , day before yesterday , it stops a man up . Open my gut now they 'd find turds stacked up like little lack twigs .

TEAGUE: What you looking to catch ?
RUBY: What ?
TEAGUE: With that trap .
RUBY: We got some critter stealing ou corn .
TEAGUE: Still but the two of you up there , is it ?
RUBY: You know it .
TEAGUE: When we get a cold night , camped out , trying to keep the rule of law , protecting girls like you from Federals and deserters , that 's a thought warms us ai n't it ? the two of you up there on my Grand-daddy 's farm , dressed in men 's clothes . Warms us right up . What you got in the sacks ? Looks like human heads ! Eh ? Looks like a bunch of heads . We got competition !
SALLY: Ruby
RUBY: I 'm not stopping , Sally . I 'm not snooping neither . Just you should know Teague and his boys are lurking down by Pigeon River , the old mill .
SALLY: You tell Ada that was a good pie .
MADDY: Mind that Billy , he 's the jealous kind .
INMAN: Fighting .
MADDY: And your neck ?
INMAN: Different fighting .
MADDY: You 're the color of a cadaver . I 'll fix you . I can fix you up .
INMAN: Mister you could fix me I 'd be in your everlasting debt .
MADDY: Debts , fighting them words do n't mean much round here . For the record , I 'm a female of the species .
RUBY: The hat 's a nice touch .
ADA: I cried for my Daddy . I dressed up the scarecrow in his suit and he came back , his arms out , said you never cried enough , you never cried enough .
RUBY: Well now you did .
ADA: Then I thought , it 's not my Daddy , it 's my sweetheart . I saw him once that way , when I looked down Sally 's well . So I dressed the scarecrow in the dress I wore the day he left . In case his spirit flies over looking out for me . That looks terrible . Ruby opens the sacks .
RUBY: I bargained like Lucifer . We can make all kinds of good eating .
ADA: Such as ?
RUBY: Cabbage . Slaw , sauerkraut , cabbage soup , fried cabbage , stuffed cabbage
TEAGUE: Afternoon .
ESCO: Do n't spread out . Why they spreading out ?
TEAGUE: I 'm not spreading out . I 'm sitting here .
ESCO: There 's a war on .
TEAGUE: Got to watch out for the Bogey Man .
ESCO: Get off my land .
TEAGUE: Your boys come back .
ESCO: Ai n't seen my boys in four years . They 're fighting other boys , not old men and women .
TEAGUE: He means us . He 's referring there to us . So you wo n't care if we take a look around ?
ESCO: What I got ta give you ? A chicken ? A lamb ?
TEAGUE: Sure .
ESCO: Right then .
TEAGUE: Thing is you got one barrel and there 's five of us . Not a fair fight .
BOSIE: Bogey Man ! Bogey Man !
RUBY: What 's that ?
TEAGUE: You 're harbouring deserters . I can confiscate every animal on this farm , every plate , every sheet , every little pellet of chicken shit I can confiscate your old lady 's asshole , so do n't offer me a bird .
RUBY: I ca n't get this damn thing off her .
ADA: Dear Lord in heaven .
RUBY: Ada , I ca n't get this off her !
ADA: Wait !
RUBY: This world wo n't stand long . God wo n't let it stand this way long .
INMAN: How long have I been sleeping ?
MADDY: Not long enough .
INMAN: I ca n't stop here . I 'm a deserter . They find me here things could be ad for you .
MADDY: What they going to do ? Cut short my young life ? Sit down before you fall down .
INMAN: How long you been up here ?
MADDY: What year are we ? '63 ?
INMAN: Last time I checked it was '64 .
MADDY: I 'd say twenty six years .
INMAN: Twenty six years !
MADDY: I could move on anytime . I 've seen most of the world anyway , Richmond in the North , south almost to Charleston . You 're going somewhere or you are somewhere , what 's the difference ?
INMAN: I could be at killing for days sometimes , in the hand to hand , my feet against the feet of my enemy and I always killed him and he neve killed me .
MADDY: He gave it a try , to look at you .
INMAN: I guess he did .
MADDY: See I think there 's a plan . There 's a design . For each and every one of us .
INMAN: It 's true
MADDY: What is ?
INMAN: What you remember .
MADDY: What 's her name ?
INMAN: Ada . Sometimes I think I 'm crazy when I 'm just hungry Ada Monroe .
MADDY: And is she waiting for you ?
INMAN: She was . I do n't know . Or if she 'd know me . I 'm like the boy who goes out in winter for firewood comes ack in the spring with a whistle .
MADDY: Now drink this . It visits the pain . And you 'll sleep . He drinks the laudanum she 's made .
INMAN: I 've had to put myself in the way of people 's kindness .
MADDY: I hope you found it .
INMAN: The passenger pigeons fly south , the erries ripen . Whether I see them o not , whether a man dies , or a war is won .
MADDY: That 's the laudanum getting to you . That 's good . Say something more . Raise that up for me .
INMAN: She gave me a book . Ada Monroe . Man y the name of Bartram . Wrote about his travels . I carried that book through every battle . I left it someplace , got to get it back . Sometimes just reading the name of a place near home Sorell Cove , Fire Scale Ridge was enough to bring me to tears . Thing is I 've been thinking those places belonged to people before us , to the Indian and he had a different name . What did he call Sorell Cove ? How can a name not even the real name break your heart ? It 's her , she 's the place I 'm heading . And I hardly know her . So how can a person who 's maybe not even a real person I do n't know what I 'm talking about I have to close my eyes
RUBY: It 's a man .
ADA: What is ?
RUBY: Raiding our corn . Got him in the trap . That 's him yelping .
ADA: You 're not going to shoot him !
RUBY: I do n't want him to shoot me . Can you fire this thing ?
ADA: Yes .
RUBY: Listen up you got a barrel trained on your rear-end .
STOBROD: Get me out of this dang thing . My fist 's about to drop off .

STOBROD: Ruby ? God damn !
ADA: What ?
RUBY: That 's my daddy
STOBROD: Just so 's you know I can eat while she 's doing this in case you 're holding off .
RUBY: Just so 's you know you 're not eating inside . Number One they hang people round here for taking in deserters . Number two even if they gave out prizes you 'd still eat outside .
STOBROD: You 're scarred .
RUBY: I 'm what ?
STOBROD: Your heart . Scarred . I did wrong to you .
RUBY: You 'd be scarred . You 'd be really scarred if I had n't wrapped them trap teeth in sacking . Which was he idea .
STOBROD: I hurt you .
RUBY: Good God !
STOBROD: I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind . Ruby this , Ruby that , Ruby with the eyes that sparkle .
RUBY: Hey ! Let 's agree you beat me , you abandoned me , you ignored me , you eat me some more all of that is etter than Ruby with the eyes that sparkle !
STOBROD: I 'm changed . People change . Wa changes people something terrible . Ruby 's told you I 've no doubt I was n't always the best
RUBY: You were an asshole .
STOBROD: I ca n't disagree with that . I was .

Got a new fiddle it 's got a little snake 's rattle in the ody took it off a dead federal in Virginia . That 's a beautiful fiddle . It 's full of tunes , Ruby . Do n't know if it 's from that little attle locked up in it , or from something untied my heart .
RUBY: You 're all set .
STOBROD: Bless you both . He goes to the door .
RUBY: Ai n't you got a proper coat ?
STOBROD: Darling , I 'm fine . And you just say the word , I wo n't come back neither . I do n't want to put either you o your mistress here in any bother .
ADA: I 'm not Ruby 's employer .
STOBROD: Oh , okay , who is ?
RUBY: Nobody . I 'll make up food for you , you come Sundays before it 's light , I 'll leave it behind the Old Frazier Mill .
STOBROD: Do you know who really needs a coat , darling , is my partner , fat boy name of Pangle . We 're hiding up in the caves and he feels the cold like a thin man , but ai n't no coat 'll fit him . I love you , Ruby . In case the sky falls on our head . You 're a good girl .
RUBY: He is so full of manure , that man , we could lay him on the dirt and grow another one just like him .
ADA: So that 's Stobrod Thewes .
RUBY: It is and that 's the last you 'll see of him .
MADDY: That 's medicine and goatmeat . You 're sick of both .
INMAN: I have a deal to thank you for . She hands him an ancient flintlock pistol .
MADDY: And that 's just for show , or if you can get close enough a wild turkey .
RUBY: Get on back where you came from ! Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away .
ADA: a source of little visible delight , But necessary .
RUBY: She ai n't gon na marry Linton , is she ? She said whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same . You ca n't say that and then marry Linton .
ADA: We 'll find out .
RUBY: Okay .
ADA: Tomorrow .
RUBY: I 'm not waiting until tomorrow .
ADA: Ruby , I 'm falling asleep .
RUBY: Little visible delight , but necessary . I like that
INMAN: I 'm one man alone . I 'm a Confederate soldier on furlough . I have no bad intention . I need shelter and food .
SARA: There 's some beans and corn pone , all I got . You better come in .
INMAN: Thank you .
SARA: I 'm alone here , as you can see , with my baby . I need to believe you mean no harm .
INMAN: No , I mean to give it to you .

INMAN: Is your baby sick ?
SARA: He cries . I do n't know . He cries a lot . My man is dead . He took his wound at Fredericksburg . Never saw his boy .
INMAN: I 'm sorry .
SARA: It 's pretty much what you 'll get if you knock on any door of this war . Man dead , woman left .
INMAN: There 's no hunting on the road , just cress and
SARA: I need to feed this man , if you could look away .
INMAN: I could do that for you in the morning .

RUBY: What kind of name 's Georgia ?
ADA: It 's where he comes from , it 's not his name .
RUBY: I know that 's meant to be the ugliest state under the heavens .
ADA: Why do you care what his name is ?
RUBY: What 's that cluster of Stars ?
ADA: Orion .
RUBY: What about them shaped like a wishbone ?
ADA: That 's Taurus the bull , and that 's Gemini and that 's Orion 's big dog , Canis Major .

PISTOL: How long does he want ? Hey ! Leave some for the rest of us .
INMAN: Move away from the baby .
BARDOLPH: Do n't shoot .
INMAN: Take off your boots . Take off your pants , and your shirt .
BARDOLPH: Do n't shoot me , please . We 're starving . We have n't eaten .
INMAN: You 'd better get running before you catch your death of cold .
BARDOLPH: Thanks , thank you . I will .
SARA: Good ?
ADA: Do you think he 's dead ?

RUBY: Bad news is girls get working . I 'm going to round up the animals . This 'll settle .

STOBROD: Discharged . Took a wound at Petersburg .
TEAGUE: Oh , so like a hero 's discharge .
STOBROD: I guess .
TEAGUE: And your boyfriend ?
STOBROD: The military would n't take him . He ca n't fight . He 's simple . He 's got a mind no bigger ' n a pickled walnut .
TEAGUE: I 'm sorry he 's fat , he 's simple and got titties but you 're insisting he ai n't a woman . God damn ! Do n't that sausage smell outstanding .

PANGLE: That bastard Teague .
TEAGUE: Really .
PANGLE: Bad words . Folk always put the curse words in front of your name .
STOBROD: Mr. Teague wants us to play .
PANGLE: Okay .
TEAGUE: We heard there were deserters in these parts . Hiding out in a big cave .
STOBROD: Not come to my ears .
TEAGUE: You do n't know where this cave is ?
STOBROD: No , sir .
PANGLE: You do , Stobes ! He means
STOBROD: Right , right ! he means , there is a cave , right , it 's up over the othe side , big cave , we played some music up there , never occurred to me they were deserters . Near Bearpen Branch .
PANGLE: Ai n't nowhere near Bearpen Branch ! It 's this side ! He 's always getting lost . That cave we live there ! it 's over on Big Stomp . Tell you how I always find it . There 's a big old locust tree fell down across the path , that points straight at it , like a finger , always a dozen squirrels round that tree . You gets to the tree , sit on it , and there 's your entrance , straight in front of you , tree points at it . Come right to your hand , them squirrels Chrrrpppp ! Chrrrrppp !

TEAGUE: Put your hat over your face .
PANGLE: What do you mean ?
TEAGUE: Cover your face with your hat .
ADA: I told Georgia he can stop here , sleep in the barn . He 's got nothing inside him . He 'd walk out of here and die in the snow .
RUBY: He can milk the cows . I was worrying about that . It 'll be dark in a couple of hours . I 's ten hours climb from here . He 's drawn a map .
ADA: Okay .
RUBY: You know these fools stayed the night in the Mill ? That 's Stobrod he ca n't do one good thing without adding the bad . Left tracks in the snow all the way up for them Home Guards to follow . That 's a sign says shoot me !
ADA: Ruby , I 'm so sorry .
RUBY: We should get going .
ADA: I do n't understand .
RUBY: Maybe Teague 's took him . They did that with the Swanger boys did n't , they ? dragged them into town , then strung them up as warning it 's snowed since , so I ca n't read the story on the ground .
ADA: Ruby ! Ruby !
RUBY: He 's still breathing ! God damn ! Daddy ; Daddy it 's Ruby . Do n't you die on me again . He 's still breathing !
ADA: Let 's get him home . We have herbs there and it 's warm .
RUBY: He 'll die first . He 's got hardly no lood left in him .
ADA: He 'll die lying here .
RUBY: There 's a place further on up . Used to be . Old Cherokee place . There 's good water right by it . Ada puts the snow-packed pan on the fire .
ADA: This horse is weary . He 's ready to give up the ghost .
RUBY: Yes , it do , country girl .
ADA: Turn round and go back where you came from .
INMAN: Ada ? Ada Monroe ?
ADA: I do not know you .
INMAN: Then I believe I made a mistake .
ADA: Inman ?
RUBY: Congratulations , I should send you out with a shotgun more often . He looks as he needs sleep .
INMAN: I may need to .
RUBY: Be my guest . You shot or something ?
INMAN: Not lately .
RUBY: Hungry ? He woke up .
ADA: Stobrod ?
RUBY: Said your mommy 's name was Grace then closed his eyes again .
ADA: He 's asleep . They both are .
RUBY: I 'm not surprised . Your man looks played out .
ADA: I saw him . I realize now .
RUBY: Saw him when ?
ADA: In Sally Swanger 's well . A tunnel of trees . The man like a black smudge in the snow , the sun behind him .
RUBY: Well there you are .
ADA: Funny thing is it was n't the same . The image . It was n't snowing . And in the well , he was , as if he were falling .
RUBY: You probably do n't remember it right .
ADA: I remember it exactly . There were crows , these black crows flying towards me . I thought I was seeing him fall . Instead I was seeing him come back to me . All this while I 've een packing ice around my heart . How will I make it melt ?
RUBY: Better get a fire going . I 've got big plans for that farm . Got a vision in my mind of how that Cove needs to be .
ADA: I know you have .
RUBY: There 's not a thing we ca n't do ourselves .
INMAN: I 'm sorry . I was trying to be quiet .
ADA: I could n't sleep .
INMAN: I got no appetite left to be in a oom with wounded men .
ADA: I ca n't see your face .
INMAN: It 's not a face you recognised .
ADA: Did you get my letters ?
INMAN: I got three letters . Carried them in that book you gave me . The Bertram .
ADA: I must have sent 100 . Did you write to me ?
INMAN: Whenever I could . If you never got them I can summarize .
ADA: No , it 's
INMAN: I pray you 're well . I pray I 'm in your thoughts . You are all that keeps me from sliding into some dark place .
ADA: But how did I keep you ? We barely knew each other . A few moments .
INMAN: A thousand moments . They 're like a ag of tiny diamonds glittering in a lack heart . Do n't matter if they 're eal or things I made up . The shape of your neck . The way you felt unde my hands when I pulled you to me .
ADA: Your boots , one polished , one not yet polished .
INMAN: You 're playing a piano and I 'm standing outside .
ADA: I 'm playing a piano and you 're standing outside .
INMAN: That kiss which I 've kissed again every day of my walking .
ADA: Every day of my waiting .
INMAN: Maybe you ca n't see my face , but if you could see my inside , my whateve you want to name it , my spirit , that 's the fear I have deeper than any gash on my neck . I think I 'm ruined . They kept trying to put me in the ground , ut I was n't ready , no ma'am , no more ready than that scoundrel in there 's not ready to die on us . But if I had goodness , I lost it . If I had anything tender in me I shot it dead . Ruby stomps out of the hut .
RUBY: Number one shut this door , it 's freezing . Number two shut that door , it 's freezing . I 'm laying on my back , with my fingers poked in my ears trying to shut out who 's got a bag of diamonds and who 's got boots needs polishing , If you want to get three feet up a bull 's ass listen to what sweethearts whispe to each other .
ADA: Now I ca n't see anything . A long pause .
INMAN: I 'll say goodnight .
ADA: I do n't think Ruby 's vacating my hut so that you can sleep in a different one .
INMAN: Right .
ADA: As long as she wants . And if she never leaves I 'll be glad .
INMAN: More a question could she put up with me .
ADA: And you understand she 's my friend , she 's not a hired hand and she does n't empty a night jar unless it 's he own .
INMAN: Sure .
ADA: This war 's made some things pointless . It 's hard to imagine a wedding . I think even my father would recognize that .
INMAN: Ada , I want to marry you . If you 'll have me .
ADA: Is n't there 's some religion where you just have to say I marry you , three times , and then you 're man and wife .
INMAN: I marry you . I marry you . I marry you . Ada laughs , unsettling Inman .
ADA: No , I think it 's I divorce you three times and then you 're not married anymore .
INMAN: I can wait for you .
ADA: You waited enough . I certainly did . I marry you . I marry you . I marry you . And they kiss , tentative , then more urgent .
INMAN: Not for all the gold dollars in the Federal Bank .
ADA: We can all go together .
INMAN: It 's safer this way . No one has quarrel with you .
RUBY: He 's right .
INMAN: I gather I need permission if I reckon on living at Black Cove .
ADA: You be safe .
INMAN: Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some category of fly born on the hide of a cow . It flies up into a tree and waits and waits until it smells cow . It can wait a year , two years , I do n't know , maybe longer . Then a cow comes along and it wakes up , flies down , lays its eggs on the cow . There 's purpose for you .
ADA: And am I the fly in this story , o the cow ?
STOBROD: You come up the mountain for me , darling , I 'd be dead otherwise , dead and gone .
RUBY: You 'd have found some other fool to escue you .
STOBROD: He 's sweet on you , that Georgia boy . He coughs for a long time .
RUBY: If you say a thing and then cough it 's a lie . Daddy , stay on that horse , and do n't lose him or sell him . We 'll need him on the farm .
ADA: I thought you were thinking on him !
RUBY: I was not . I was thinking on swollen udders and before you say same difference
ADA: I 'm saying nothing . Ruby elbows her .
RUBY: Miss lovey-dovey ! Ada elbows her back .
INMAN: Do n't look round .
STOBROD: Got it .
INMAN: How many men does he have ?
STOBROD: There were five . You ca n't reason with that man .
INMAN: I got a conversation stopper . Closer we get to that broken ground the better .
STOBROD: Okay .
INMAN: One , two , three .
TEAGUE: God damn ! You 're a hard fucker to put down . Good directions to that cave from the fat boy saw the squirrels , sat on the tree made some friends , ought some back with me . His riders begin , quite casually , to fan out .
INMAN: Come out of there .
BOSIE: No , sir . Here 's fine .
INMAN: I just have to shoot the horse from under you .
BOSIE: Shoot her . She 's not mine . You riding Mr Teague 's mare ?
INMAN: I am .
BOSIE: He dead ?
INMAN: I hope so . Look , how old are you ? Give me you gun and ride home , I 'm done fighting . I 'm sick of it .
BOSIE: I give you my gun you 'll shoot me dead .
INMAN: I will not shoot you , but nor am I walking down that mountain looking over my shoulder for you .
BOSIE: That 's what they call a conundrum . I tell you what I 've got on my side .
INMAN: What have you got on your side ?
BOSIE: The confidence of youth .
ADA: You bring that lamb outside .
GRACE: What are you doing !
ADA: He came out dead , love .
GRACE: Do n't kill him !
ADA: I 'm not going to kill him . But we have to try something or else he 's going to die .
ALL: Amen ! And they eat .

GORDY: What happened ? Last night you were in love with her .
FELIX: I had a dream I fed he lobster , got her drunk , and she ejected me for another man . Dreams tell the future .
GORDY: That was n't a dream , that was the alcohol talking You saying two men ca n't go have a beer and look at women 's breasts because of pink elephants ? Nothing makes any sense down here .

GORDY: You killed my wife and son
WOMAN: Claudio .
THE WOLF: You were just saved by you guardian angel .

SELENA: My name is Selena .
GORDY: His wife ?
SELENA: Yes .

GORDY: Thanks .
SELENA: The men in jail with you in Mompos They say you talked to a man from the C.I.A .
GORDY: I 'm not one of them . I 'm here fo my own reasons .
SELENA: Claudio used to be a teacher . I was a medical aid worker . We met in Guatemala , in an Indian village called Guamaunco . We were married there . Sophia , our daughter was orn there . Claudio was kind and loving , and we were happy We were there four years when the civil war broke out The guerrillas were all around us , but left us alone Then they made an attack on the army nearby . The next night , soldiers came to ou village . They were led by American 'advisors ' They accused us of helping the rebels . Our women were raped . Our men were tortured . Our homes were urned We crawled out into the fields , but they threw grenades , and Sophia Selena hesitates , choking back her emotions .
SELENA: Claudio joined the guerrillas . When that war ended , we moved to the next war , and the next Each fight has only deepened his hatred . And poisoned his soul . He 's unable to love anything anymore
GORDY: Why are you still here ?
SELENA: Because I know he was a good man , who 's been consumed by rage ecause of what he lost Just like you .
GORDY: I 'm not like him .
SELENA: Not yet .

UPDEGRAF: Hitting the whole village could make for a P.R . problem .
BRANDT: I do n't care what the Puerto Ricans say . Which part of the word 'war ' do n't you understand ? Our mission down here is n't just about catching The Wolf .
UPDEGRAF: What about Gordy Pitt ?

SELENA: I ca n't .
BRANDT: It 's time to make The Wolf howl .
SELENA: We 're going with you . When Gordy 's free
GORDY: How do we get out ?
SELENA: The guard is the only one close . When we 're past him , we can slip into the jungle . Mauro 's waiting for us there .
L.O.H. PILOT: Lead chops are twenty seconds out .
SELENA: He 's on the right No needless killing .
L.O.H. PILOT: SAM coming . He hits a button , and
GROUND COMMANDER: We 're going for body count .

GORDY: How do you say 'hello ' ?
BRANDT: F.B.I . 's on the radio . Tell 'em everything you know .
GORDY: They both get asylum . And she needs a medic .
BRANDT: On the plane .

BRANDT: They 'll get it . But she 's in my custody till we 're done with her .

PHIPPS: These buildings best match what you described to us .
SELENA: I do n't recognize anything I saw only parts of the building I 'm sorry .
PHIPPS: That 's okay . We 'll keep trying .
SELENA: I think it 's a public place . He said he wanted the people of America to feel the terror . 'Terror is all they understand . ' He said it over and over
PHIPPS: Double up on public venues museums , theaters , transport Put in all the extra undercover we can .
GORDY: Where 're we going ?

DRAY: Why not just shut it down ?
PHIPPS: If we spook him , we do n't know what his secondary target 'll be .
SELENA: Please do n't kill him .
PHIPPS: That 's him , is n't it ?
SELENA: Yes .
PHIPPS: He was there yesterday . Just stood there and left So far , the dogs have n't found anything , so maybe we 're ahead of him .
BRANDT: What 's he waiting for ?
SELENA: He takes his time . Like he told you , he enjoys it .
PHIPPS: Are you okay ?
SELENA: I 'm sorry I think I 'm going to e sick . Brandt opens a door to a bathroom .
BRANDT: In here .

BRANDT: He always hid his face . Why 's he giving us a clear picture now ?
PHIPPS: Feeling better ?
SELENA: I think I 'd feel better if I could est a little and see my son .
BRANDT: Escort her .

And when he cheats , he cheats death itself !
LARGEST TEEN: He said leave , motherless whelp .
URAN: In the black crag in the high pass stands a wooden training sword . The one who claims it , with stone still in his mouth , will have earned the ight to train with the warriors .
CIMMERIAN BOY: Conan ! Run !
CORIN: Conan ? Conan ? !
CONAN: They killed one . I killed three . I am a warrior now .
CORIN: A warrior ? What you have done a jackal would do . Never a warrior .
CONAN: They would have done the same
CORIN: As I said , jackals .
TO URAN: He is not ready . I will forge him myself .
CORIN: Stoke your fire , boy . Conan slams the bellows closed , anger rising .
CONAN: `` Stoke your fire , chop your wood . '' I have slept where wolves dare not . I have balanced a thousand rive stones . When will you teach me the sword ? Corin stares his son in the eyes . Judging .
CORIN: Think you 're ready ? Then tell me what is a sword 's purpose ?
CONAN: To slay ones enemies .
CORIN: No . That is what it does . Its purpose is why you use it . He tosses Conan two lumps of ore .
CONAN: Why did it break ?
CORIN: Because it had no life .
CIMMERIAN SENTRY: See something ?
UKAFA: That 's the last of their guard towers .
LUCIUS: All this sneaking around for a lowly tribe of barbarians .
KHALAR SINGH: Then show us . But should you fail , emember the plan .
CORIN: Conan ?
LUCIUS: Retreat !
CORIN: Wait ! Hold your ground !
URAN: Death is in the air , invaders . Can you taste it ?
LUCIUS: Indeed . I savor it .
CHARGE: 13 .
CONAN: Father !
CORIN: Come .
CONAN: Do we need more weapons ?
CORIN: Go . There is a hunting lodge in the North Pass with provisions .
CONAN: No ! I will fight !
CORIN: This fight is over , but yours has just begun . You wanted to be a warrior of the tribe , Conannow you must be its last .
CONAN: Father , I am not afraid to die .
CORIN: Good . Make your death have purpose .
CONAN: No !
PICT: ( strange dialect -
SUBTITLED: Their heads . You promised me thei heads .
KHALAR SINGH: All you wish , once we are gone .
CORIN: What is it you want ?
KHALAR SINGH: I seek neither gold nor steel , but flesh and blood . The last of a oyal line that goes back three thousand years . Corin LAUGHS .
CORIN: Royalty in Cimmeria ? Never . Each man is free here .
KHALAR SINGH: But I seek a woman .
CORIN: My wife was killed , long ago , by swine such as you . Khalar nods , understanding .
KHALAR SINGH: Then our stories began in the same place , Cimmerian . I too lost my wife to marauders . How many men , in how many lands have suffered so ? The only answer is power , strength unfettered , the kind of which can unite all Hyboria under a single crown . That is the legacy I seek . Will you join me ?
FARIQ: I would cut out his eyes , father , so that he will not find them . So he will wander the afterlife forever . Khalar smiles .
KHALAR SINGH: Show me your strength , Fariq . Without it , you will never rule . With it , you will never be forgotten .
CORIN: Soon it comes for you .
KHALAR SINGH: Burn this place . It no longe exists .
BARKEEP: He 's back there . The barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers .
DRUNKEN MAN: Piss-water ! You 'll serve my friends and I your best , barman , or you 'll taste steel !
STRUGGLING: By the gods , he 's as heavy as a horse .
LIEUTENANT: What 's the charge ?
CONAN: Where 's the Captain of the Guard ?
LIEUTENANT: In the cells , interrogating a prisoner . And you 'll get the same if you do n't answer . You 're accused of public drunkenness . How do you plead ?
CONAN: In truth , I 've been guilty of much . Jewels stolen from the crowns of kings , men 's heads split in battle for the price of a night 's drink . But through that I 've searched and waited and hunted my prey .
LIEUTENANT: I do n't have it . There 's a guard inside the door . Only he can open it . Conan picks up the Lieutenant 's sword .
GUARD #1: What is it ?
LUCIUS: Men !
CONAN: I came for you , Lucius .
LUCIUS: You talk as though you know me , ape .
CONAN: I do . And I am no ape . I am Cimmerian .
LUCIUS: What do you want ? Who are you ? Conan turns his face to the burnt side .
CONAN: I 'm the one who made you pretty .
LUCIUS: Impossible ! You 're dead !
CONAN: No . I am death . And I came a long way for you . Conan lifts the sword .
LUCIUS: Wait ! ! Wait ! !
CONAN PAUSES: I can tell you where the rest are .
CONAN: Where ?
LUCIUS: The end of the earth . You kill me , and you 'll never find them .
CONAN: Who are you offering ?
LUCIUS: Who do you think ? All of them . Ukafa , Remo , Cheren , Akhun and Khalar Singh himself . But you have to swear you wo n't kill me . Conan thinks about it .
CONAN: You have my word . You tell me where I will find Khalar Singh , and I will not kill you .
LUCIUS: He is in a city called on the edge of the Eastern Sea . On the edge of Hyboria . Khor Khalba .
CONAN: Toasting , to our deal .
LUCIUS: Barbarian ! I had your word ! You said you would spare my life !
CONAN: No . I said I would n't kill you .
UKAFA: Khalar Singh , we 've lost half ou cavalry legion , and still Fariq presses on ! We must turn back !
KHALAR SINGH: He says the Queen is here .
UKAFA: He leads us in circles . He knows nothing of leading an army
KHALAR SINGH: Take care , Ukafa . You hold a special place in my kingdom , but lood you are not .
UKAFA: My apologies , Khalar Singh . I am simply concerned for your army .
KHALAR SINGH: And I would gladly sacrifice every last man to get my hands on the Queen . And in that respect , Fariq has my confidence . He knows more of the legends of Acheron than anyone .
FARIQ: Father , they are here ! The hidden oasis , just as it was written .
TAMARA: Stop it ! I 'm trying to pray !
ILIRA: I 'm bored .
TAMARA: Then hit yourself .
ILIRA: I 'm sorry , Fassir . I just tire of saying the same prayer every day .
FASSIR: Then you should be able to translate it from its original Acheronian .
TAMARA: Of course she can . She even taught it to me . `` Never again . ''
FASSIR: Go on .
TAMARA: Never again will we stand by as darkness consumes the world . Neve again will innocents suffer fo others ' power . Never again will the Queen suffer so Acheron may rise .
FASSIR: Very good , Tamara . You must have taught her very well indeed , Ilira .
ILIRA: We ca n't leave them .
TAMARA: If you are caught , everything we live for is lost !
REMO: No swords . Khalar needs them alive .
TAMARA: Good to know .
REMO: The north gate . Destroy it .
TAMARA: Run !
ILIRA: We 'll die !
TAMARA: We 'll die if we stay !
KHALAR SINGH: Who was guarding that gate ?
REMO: It was I , Lord .
KHALAR SINGH: Take four legions . Hunt her . Before I hunt you .
TAMARA: Water please
HEAD SLAVER: The gods are good . Chain this one in my cage . She 'll e the prize of the auction in Kho Kalba .
KHALAR SINGH: All these years searching the ends of the earth . And here you are . Just a two day ride from Kho Kalba . I can scarcely believe it .
FASSIR: Say nothing .
KHALAR SINGH: Yes . Say nothing . Maybe he does n't know who we are . Maybe he 's not looking for the Queen . Several of the women look up at him , shocked .
FASSIR: You come for your own dark purposes , to raise Acheron .
KHALAR SINGH: Yes . I come to resurrect the greatest empire Hyboria has eve known .
FASSIR: An empire of evil , soaked in blood sacrifice and the blackest of magic .
KHALAR SINGH: Have you hidden from the world so long that you can not to see ? Blood , magic , death it is everywhere . Acheron is no different than any other kingdom , but for its glory .
MORE: 34 .
FASSIR: You would have all the world suffer , as you have suffered . We will die before we help you .
KHALAR SINGH: Yes . You will .
FARIQ: The caves beneath Khor Khalba contain all manner of creature , many altered by centuries of lood magic . But one , in particular , has developed a special connection to the blood . A thirst . It is said that only the Queen of Acheron itself can resist its embrace . He stops , one woman away from Ilira .
SLAVE TRADER: Wake up , slags ! Smile ! A new owne approaches !
TAMARA: Let me go . I promise you 'll be ewarded . The Trader just laughs , leering at her .
SLAVE TRADER: And I would sample that reward , fair one , but you wear white .
MORE: 36 .
TURNS AWAY: Good day , sir ! A lone rider in a desolate land . The perfect custome for what I sell .
SHEMISH WOMAN: Please , master ! Your gold can free me from this hole ! I can bring you
SLAVE TRADER: Silence whore !
CONAN: Khor Kalba . Which way ?
SLAVE TRADER: This is the road to Khor Kalba . Ahead . Past the Great Wall .
ENORMOUS BOULDERS: 37 .
CONAN: Use your whips on the horses ' legs ! The Slavers are confused . Then they notice
REMO: The girl ! Bring her to Khalar !
CONAN: Who are you ?
TAMARA: I am nobody .
CONAN: Many died to capture nobody . Get up .
TAMARA: And if I do n't wish to ride with you ?
CONAN: Perhaps the slavers took you orders . I do n't .
TAMARA: I never knew men could be so cruel . Now I wonder if the world is filled with animals such as you .
CONAN: You speak of animals as if they were less than men . But animals do n't stab their brothers in the ack or steal their mother 's only possession . And they never lie .
TAMARA: I have n't lied .
CONAN: Very well . Give me your name .
TAMARA: I am Tamara Amelia Karushan . And you ?
CONAN: I am Conan .
TAMARA: Conan ? That 's it ?
CONAN: What more names do I need ?
TAMARA: Before we eat , I must pray .
CONAN: Crom ! What would you pray for ? That a bone may not get stuck in you throat ? No words nor gods will give you one more moment than fate allows you .
TAMARA: Then you have no faith . And I am sorry for you .
CONAN: I need no pity .
TAMARA: But you do . You live in a world that is harsh and short . Where fate is unyielding and hope is a cruel joke . I live in a world with a purpose that guides me , where faith sustains me .
CONAN: Do n't worry . His back is broken . He wo n't be slinking away this time .
TAMARA: But what about him ? ! Remo GROANS in pain .
CONAN: I enjoy a little music with my meal .
REMO: Please ! Mercy !
CONAN: You are more fit to inflict torture than to endure it . Your life is not nailed to your spine as my peoples are .
REMO: Stop ! Stop ! I know how make you ich ! Rich ! You hear name Khala Singh ? You have what he want . The girl , yes ? Khalar give you anything for her . More !
CONAN: Why would he ?
REMO: She could be the one .
CONAN: One what ?
REMO: The one . The Queen .
CONAN: A queen in hiding .
REMO: Yes ! Yes ! I sent to find her . Bring her . He wait for me now , at Great Wall . He pay you anything . More !
CONAN: So I should ransom her to you master ? Not exactly loyal but still , a good idea .
REMO: Please ! Please ! I help you ! I do anything you wish !
CONAN: Good . Die .
KHALAR SINGH: He brought a message ?
UKAFA: I 'll find them and come back with their heads .
FARIQ: You let the girl escape once , Ukafa . What makes you think you can do better now ?
UKAFA: I did what ?
FARIQ: I found the monastery . It was my understanding that you were in charge of its capture Ukafa 's anger grows .
KHALAR SINGH: Enough ! We will take no chances . We will pay this thief what he wants , and more .
CONAN: Here . Eat .
TAMARA: Could n't you at least cook it first ?
CONAN: Fire draws attention .
TAMARA: Does it bother you , blood on you hands ?
CONAN: The only blood on these hands I claimed with my own sword .
TAMARA: What does that mean ?
CONAN: Clean hands mean nothing . Kings and Queens claim more lives than I will ever meet , and not a drop is spilled in their presence .
TAMARA: What are you talking about ? I 've done no harm to you . I 've done no harm to anyone . Conan confronts her , enraged .
CONAN: You lie . You are the very reason my people are dead .
TAMARA: Are you mad ? I never met you people .
CONAN: But Khalar Singh has . He destroyed my people , looking for you . Suddenly Tamara understands .
TAMARA: The one who came for us ? His name is Khalar Singh ?
CONAN: You know this .
TAMARA: We did not know who sought us , only that we were sought .
CONAN: You hid from him . And while you did , others died in your place .
TAMARA: If we did not hide , countless more would have been killed ! You do not know what purpose he has for ou queen .
CONAN: And I do not care , for he will not live to see it bear fruit ! Tamara is shocked .
TAMARA: Wait you seek to kill this Khalar ? We have the same aim . He takes my queen to Khor Kalba . I have sworn an oath to protect her . I can help you .
CONAN: Enough lies .
TAMARA: What use is talking ? You wo n't elieve a word I speak . I only want to know this how will you kill Khalar ? You are too big to play the assassin .
CONAN: You will be the lure that will draw me close . Then I will scale the wall and cut him down where he stands .
TAMARA: And the archers and cavalry ? They will be napping ?
CONAN: They will not be a problem . Tamara thinks about it .
TAMARA: No . Not good enough . Conan is shocked by her brazen response .
CONAN: Did I ask ?
TAMARA: Should you fail , I 'll be left without a weapon , helpless in my enemies hands . Let me help , Conan .
CONAN: I will not fail .
FARIQ: Let me take care of this thief , father . He 's beneath your notice .
KHALAR SINGH: He killed Remo , likely his cavalry legion as well . Whatever he is , he is more than a mere thief .
CONAN: Be still ! Conan thrusts Tamara in Khalar 's direction .
KHALAR SINGH: Triple your price . Come and claim it .
CONAN: Send the gold .
KHALAR SINGH: You 're fast . But are you fast enough ?
KHALAR SINGH: Fariq !
CONAN: I was wondering what it would take for you to stop cowering .
KHALAR SINGH: I was n't cowering . I was studying . You 're quite gifted with a sword , ut it 's not from schooling . You speed and power makes up for a lack of finesse . I 've seen such fighting before Cimmerian .
CHEREN: No ! !
FARIQ: What of me , father ?
KHALAR SINGH: You will return to Khor Kalba . You will feed the women to the beast until you find our Queen .
FARIQ: I will not . I will track the arbarian with you
KHALAR SINGH: You think I care what you wish ? ! You want to play warrior ? It is not in you . One day you will be king , ut warlord , never .
FARIQ: I can . Let me prove it to you !
KHALAR SINGH: You will not risk your life again . You are my line , my successor . You will not throw away all that I have worked for .
OUT LOGS: 56 .
CONAN: It 's not enough . I 've failed you father .
CORIN: It will never be enough , Conan .
CONAN: I do n't understand
CORIN: Through suffering , you will learn your purpose , boy . And you have not egun to suffer yet .
TAMARA: I would n't move so fast . I bound your wounds as best I could , but I 'm no healer .
CONAN: Where am I ?
TAMARA: On the Wasp . You told me where it laid , just before you passed out . Though I ca n't say as I feel much safer here .
CONAN: You were adequate .
ARTUS: Look what we have here . A hill ape in over his head .
CONAN: I was just wondering what that smell was . Now I know .
ARTUS: We take no stowaways . Only paying passengers . You 've best be laden with gold .
CONAN: If it 's metal you seek , perhaps you 'd settle for steel .
ARTUS: Fast , deadly , charming , rakishly handsome . All hail Conan !
PIRATES: All hail Conan !
ARTUS: Sorry , friend . Looks like you 've had a rough road .
CONAN: It wo n't get easier . Khalar Singh lives . He 'll be coming for me and the girl .
ARTUS: Good . We 're scrapping for a fight these days .
CONAN: This one may be more than you wish . I need you to get me close to Kho Kalba . Artus rubs his beard .
ARTUS: Rest up . We 'll get you there . Conan withdraws to his room .
TAMARA: We go to Khor Kalba ?
CONAN: I do .
TAMARA: No . We do .
CONAN: Just leave me to sleep .
TAMARA: Because she represent freedom , not just ours but all Hyboria 's . What do you know of Acheron ?
CONAN: A tall tale . Meant to scare children .
TAMARA: It is no fable . It 's my people 's history . Acheron was an empire that swallowed all of Hyboria , led by the King and his legion of demon warriors . Unstoppable . Insatiable . Immortal . But still it had one weakness . For the true power of Acheron laid not with its King , but the Queen . Every twenty years , a new queen from the royal line would e coronated with a crown of iron . Spikes would pierce her , slowly drain her precious blood , and through her suffering Acheron would emain invincible . Until one of my ancestors , an Acheronian himself , put a stop to this tyranny . He and others spirited the new Queen away , hiding her from the empire and all those who would raise it again .
CONAN: What care I for queens and empires ?
TAMARA: Did n't you hear me ? This evil faces us all . All of civilization will fall if the army of Acheron is aised again .
CONAN: I heard . Only I would happily put all of your `` civilization '' to the torch myself .
TAMARA: But you owe me a debt , you thankless oaf !
CONAN: My only debt is to my people . And it still lies unpaid .
SAILOR: It was a pirate ship . They left as soon as the girl and the large one oarded .
KHALAR SINGH: Which way did they sail ?
SAILOR: North . Khalar is surprised .
KHALAR SINGH: Are you certain ?
SAILOR: Yes , please , I 'm telling you the truth !
KHALAR SINGH: Send word to Ukafa . They come to him by sea .
ARTUS: Try not to taste it going down would be my advice .
TAMARA: You 've known Conan long ?
ARTUS: We sailed with him for a while . I would like to say I know the man .
TAMARA: He is a riddle to me .
ARTUS: Aye , he 's that too .
TAMARA: We have the same goal . Why will he not trust me ?
ARTUS: Why would he ? He 's a stranger in every land he trods . A man with no home , no people , none but the company of ghosts . And he bears the weight of their deaths every moment of every day .
TAMARA: That is no way to live .
ARTUS: He does n't live . I 've seen in him great mirth , only to watch it smothered by greater melancholy . He owes a blood debt , and he can entertain no other joy , no othe cause , until it is fulfilled .
TAMARA: And yet you call him friend , and isk death to help him .
ARTUS: Let me tell you something of Conan . He will never lie . He will neve eak a trust , once given . And he will never , ever give up .
TAMARA: He 's a stubborn ass . Artus LAUGHS .
ARTUS: He is that , lass . He is that .
FARIQ: Here we stand again . Will the queen eveal herself , or must anothe innocent suffer ?
MORE: 64 .
FEMALE MONK: I am the one you seek . Fariq smiles .
FARIQ: At last . Some bravery . But of course , you would n't expect me to take your word , would you ? As the Fariq reaches for her
TAMARA: No ! ! !
CONAN: Is there a better reason to drink ? Tamara actually manages to LAUGH .
TAMARA: Do you thinkI could try some of that ? I 'm curious of its taste .
CONAN: You 've never tasted mead ?
TAMARA: It 's good .
CONAN: I have no future . It died with my people , as I should have .
TAMARA: So your life is penance ? For what , for living ? And when you too die , what do you believe happens then ? Conan just shrugs , taking back the mead .
CONAN: Nothing . Tamara , her tongue loosened by drink , laughs .
TAMARA: Nothing ? I could n't live without some kind of belief in the world after this .
CONAN: I believe in the cold of steel , the warmth of flesh . All else is fairy tales .
TAMARA: Perhaps . But I still die with faith in my heart , belief in something greater than one 's self . What will you die with ?
CONAN: Purpose . I die with purpose .
PIRATE 1: To stations ! To stations ! Tamara turns and up ahead spies
ARTUS: What do you think ? They have us outnumbered , but we might beat their speed .
CONAN: That is what they wish . They drive us to another force , approaching from the south .
ARTUS: Then we fight ?
CONAN: No . We give them what they think they want . About ship ! Now !
CAPTAIN: They 're turning to run .
UKAFA: Good . We only need stay close .
ARTUS: And now ?
CONAN: Let us show them why she is called the Wasp .
TAMARA: Why is she called the Wasp ?
ARTUS: Open astern ! Load the stinger ! The Pirates rush to the back of the ship .
CAPTAIN: They are doing something .
CONAN: Fire !
SAILOR: We 're taking on water !
CAPTAIN: Hard to port !
UKAFA: No . Let them fire again !
CAPTAIN: We will sink . Ukafa guts the captain with his spear .
UKAFA: So be it . Get below . Be ready .
GALLEY: 69 .
CONAN: Fire !
UKAFA: Now ! They rush forward and grab onto the harpoon .
ARTUS: Bring her back !
CONAN: Good . I was growing weary with oredom . Conan motions to a pair of pirates .
BATTLE: 70 .
UKAFA: Find the girl !
CONAN: Time to go .
ARTUS: I could get you closer . Anothe half day along the coast
CONAN: I need you head west , to draw off our pursuers . I 'll find anothe path to Khor Kalba .
ARTUS: So be it . Swift wind at your backs .
TAMARA: So you are taking me with you to Khor Kalba .
CONAN: I never said that . But I wo n't leave a virgin onboard a pirate ship , alone .
TAMARA: I but who said I was a virgin ?
CONAN: We 'll rest here until morning .
TAMARA: Will I awake alone ? Do you intend to leave me ?
CONAN: I would do you a kindness . Kho Kalba will bring only death .
TAMARA: Please , Conan . Artus told me of how you lost your tribe . I too had to watch as my people were taken from me . Conan ignores her , gathering wood for a fire .
CONAN: We leave at dawn . I will not break stride for you . Not once . I will get you into Khor Kalba . Beyond that I have my purpose , and you yours .
TAMARA: Nice fire . Does it mean you 'll actually cook the meat this time ?
CAPTAIN: The pirate ship sailed to the west . Even under full sail it 'll be no easy task to overtake her .
KHALAR SINGH: Fariq has done well . Head east , back to Khor Kalba .
CAPTAIN: But our chase points the other way .
KHALAR SINGH: The chase is over . They come to me now .
TAMARA: What were the women of your tribe like , Conan ?
CONAN: They fought beside the men .
TAMARA: So they were equals . And you mother ?
CONAN: She died in battle , even as I was orn .
TAMARA: So you never knew her . It was the same with me . I 've always known eing a mother was somehow not my fate . But
CONAN: I do n't lie .
TAMARA: Then we do n't have much time . You mother perished too young , but at least she died having known the touch of one who cared . Tamara steps closer to Conan .
CONAN: Do you ever tire of talking ? Let me est , woman .
TAMARA: I thought that may work .
CONAN: We 'll slip in , along with those traders . But you 'll need a change of clothes , those monks ' robes will draw attention . Tamara looks down at her loose-fitting robes .
TAMARA: What will I wear ?
CONAN: And what better disguise for a monk ?
TAMARA: Is there not a living thing you can e at peace with ? They ride into the city , past the troops .
CONAN: It 's probably only way into Khalar 's fortress . I 'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times , day and night .
TAMARA: So we must try to scale the cliff .
CONAN: And dodge arrows as we do so ?
CONAN: Thieves . You 'll regret finding me .
TAMARA: Catacombs ? You mean sewers .
CONAN: What is it ?
TAMARA: A warning . These catacombs are connected to the sea . It says that the beasts of Acheron protect its secrets .
CONAN: Not from me . Conan presses on , into the darkness .
TAMARA: Where now ?
CONAN: Around . Up .
CONAN: What ?
TAMARA: Something touched me . Something slimy .
CONAN: Crom ! Stop wasting time .
TAMARA: What is that ?
CONAN: Nothing good .
AKHUN: Which ever one of you slaves gets me the girl , lives .
CONAN: Stay behind me .
TENTACLED MONSTER: 85 .
TAMARA: Where is Ilira ?
FEMALE MONK: She was taken away by Fariq .
TAMARA: Then I 'm too late .
ELDER MONK: No . She was just taken this morning . It 's not yet midnight , and Khalar still must bring her to the cave of Acheron .
CONAN: You 're going to fight Khalar 's troops ? Just you ?
TAMARA: Cimmerians are n't the only women who know how to fight . And to kill . Tamara looks at the other monks .
MORE: 88 .
CONAN: You want my help again .
TAMARA: No . You kept your word , I 'll keep mine . I pray you fulfill your debt .
ELDER MONK: Guard .
TAMARA: Do n't kill him . We need to find out which way Ilira was taken .
CONAN: Will be where your queen is . Tamara smiles . She knows it is a half truth .
TAMARA: Ilira !
KHALAR SINGH: It 's only begun . Because that one was not the heir to Acheron . Khalar smiles down at Tamara .
TAMARA: No . It ca n't be
KHALAR SINGH: Secretive , the traitors of Acheron . It was n't easy , but Fariq finally wrung honesty from the girl . That poor innocent was forced to live a lie , even as the truth was kept from the queen herself .
MORE: 90 .
TO CONAN: And you did the rest , barbarian . My thanks for delivering the Queen to me .
TAMARA: No !
FARIQ: At last you awaken , Cimmerian . It 's een hours you 've made me wait fo my fun .
CONAN: A swift end !
FARIQ: Hardly . But that is a difference etween you and me . A swift end would be a mercy I do not intend to grant . No , you must suffer for you transgressions .
MORE: 91 .
CONAN: You lie . I was there . My fathe never uttered a sound . Fariq LAUGHS , amused .
FARIQ: You were there ? What were you doing , warrior ? Watching you father die , without saying a sound ? Taking your eyes will be justice indeed , coward .
CONAN: I saw my father die . Slain by one who can only kill men already on their knees .
FARIQ: I 've killed many in battle , cur .
CONAN: Really ? Then why did your fathe not let you face me before , when I had sword in hand . He thought you unequal to the task .
TAMARA: This is no empire , only a graveyard .
KHALAR SINGH: You see only with your eyes .
KHALAR SINGH: The Acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance , do n't you think ? For one to ascend to royalty , another must fall .
TAMARA: Stop . You do n't know what you are about to do .
KHALAR SINGH: But I do . For thirty years I have dreamed of this day . The day ou people rise from the ashes .
CONAN: Crom . He reaches the eye of the skull .
KHALAR SINGH: It 's good that you pray . Gods will e here soon .
TAMARA: He'llbe-heresooner .
KHALAR SINGH: Who ?
CONAN: Let her go .
KHALAR SINGH: You 've faced me before and lost . What do you think has changed now ?
CONAN: My purpose .
THE ALTAR: 97 .
KHALAR SINGH: You are strong , Cimmerian , but we oth know you are not my equal .
CONAN: Once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength . Now let me teach you .
KHALAR SINGH: No .
TAMARA: Conan ! ! !
KHALAR SINGH: I am Khalar Singh , King of Acheron . I command you to kneel !
IN ACHERONIAN: Show him the might of the army of Acheron !
ACHERONIAN COMMANDER: First , we feed .
KHALAR SINGH: Fine . Take your fill . I will kill him myself .
CONAN: Your story ends here .

PHOEBE: Chuck
BARRIS: Albert 's dead .
PHOEBE: Well , he led an amazingly long life .
BARRIS: Still , it 's hard to go on .

BYRD: Kind of a loner , I 'd say . Fairly bright . A tad anti-social . Mad at the world . Can I buy you lunch ?
BARRIS: Look , there 's a schoolyard half a block down . Why do n't you go trolling there ? Barris gets up and starts to walk away .
BYRD: I could teach you at least thirty different ways to kill a man with a single blow , Mr. Barris . Barris stops .
BARRIS: and I figure if I can keep afloat until I come up with my next game show idea , then all will be copacetic .

BYRD: Please be discreet , Mr. Barris .
BARRIS: Jesus , it is the fucking CIA ! Hell , I 'll e a spy ! Where do I sign up ? Are you fucking with me ? You 're fucking with me , are n't you ?

BARRIS: Sure . Yeah . Okay . That 's good .
INSTRUCTOR #1: There are several efficient methods of killing a man , were you to find yourself without a weapon . The edge of your hand against the adversary 's Adam 's apple . This will crush the windpipe causing strangulation and death . The students take notes .
BARRIS: You 're training me to be a killer .
BYRD: See , Chuck , I knew you were fairly ight .
BARRIS: I ca n't kill people . My future is in television .
BYRD: Listen , you 're thirty-two years old and you 've achieved nothing . Jesus Christ was dead and alive again by thirty-three . Better get cracking .
BARRIS: I have ideas for shows .
BYRD: Oh , good . Why do n't you spend anothe six months developing 'em while staring out the window at mommy 's house next to poor dead Albert the dog .
BARRIS: How do you know all that ?
BYRD: I know everything about you , Chuck . Fo fuck 's sake , I know which hand you jerk off with . Barris lifts his hands , tries to remember .
INSTRUCTOR #1: Glycerin is , of course , the best-known nitrating agent . Now keep in mind , nitroglycerin is extremely unstable . A slight tap , a one degree change in temperature and it 'll blow up in you hands . Yee-haa , let 's mix us up a batch ! Instructor # 1 holds up a beaker .

BENITEZ: Si . In the flesh .
BYRD: What have you got for me , Manny ?
BENITEZ: Renda leaves his apartment every day at 8 30 , alone , walks east two blocks to this news kiosk , buys a paper and heads south four blocks to the plaza of the Museum Nacional to read it .
BYRD: Okay . Chuck , you 're here at 8 25 . Dress like a tourist . Start walking north . You should pass Renda here . Stop him and ask him in bad Spanish where the museum is . Make sure he does n't understand what you 're asking .

GOLDBERG: Chuck , quite frankly these episodes are unairable .
BARRIS: Look , Len , the show 's spontaneous , it 's unscripted . That 's it 's charm . I ca n't control what people say .
EXECUTIVE: Be that as it may , Mr. Barris , we ca n't have black men getting blow jobs on national television !
GOLDBERG: The point is n't that he 's black , Hank .
EXECUTIVE: Well , I know that . That 's not what I meant .
BARRIS: Look , Len , nobody is indifferent to these shows . Right ? And that 's good . Show usiness must avoid indifference at all costs .

EXECUTIVE: You do n't fuck with taste , my friend !
BARRIS: What does that even mean ? I do n't even under

No other witnesses
BARRIS: Any questions ?
ACTUAL BARRIS: Sometimes as a younger man I stretched the truth to get what I wanted . `` Through all the lying days of my youth/I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun ; /Now I may whither into the truth . '' Yeats . You heard of him ?
BARRIS: Terrific , Rod ! Yeah , I 'll get back to you on Monday . Great . Thanks . Bye .

BYRD: Boy , did n't I teach you anything ?
BARRIS: You son of a bitch !
BYRD: You 're so rusty , it 's embarrassing .

BYRD: Can I buy you lunch ?
BARRIS: My fucking neck hurts . Okay ?
BYRD: Poor baby . Look , I 've been put in charge of a fairly large wet operation and I could use your help .
BARRIS: Have you noticed , Jim , I 've got a tv show on the air ? I do n't need to kill people for hire anymore .
BYRD: I know you do n't need to . But you 'd like to .
BARRIS: That 's insane .
BYRD: Think of it as a hobby . An avocation . Something you do to relax . You can be an assassination enthusiast , a murder bug .
BARRIS: I 've got important things to think about here . I do n't have time to fuck around with you .
BYRD: Okay , I 'll help you out with your little show . Tit for tat . That 's the kinda guy I am . I 've seen this Dating Game of yours , Chuck . And I have a thought .
BARRIS: What , now you 're a television producer ?
BYRD: Hey , I 'm CIA operative John Q . Public when it comes to tv and that should make my opinion of interest to you .
BARRIS: Let 's hear it then .
BYRD: Well , what do you have now ? The couple gets sent to some stupid second-rate Hollywood shitcan restaurant , right ? Sets you back fifty bucks ? That 's not too exciting a prize to us vicarious- living boobs out in TV-land .
BARRIS: Yeah , what 's your point ?
BYRD: Up the stakes , Chuckles . Send 'em to some exotic locale . Europe , Southeast Asia , for example .
BARRIS: The network 's not going to let me send two unmarried kids on vacation together .
BYRD: Send 'em with a chaperone . Some espectable old lady with a sewn closed snatch .
BARRIS: Y'know , that 's not half bad .
BYRD: I 'm telling ya . And And sometimes you can be the chaperone , Chuckie . Let 's say we have a job for you in Austria . You , a successful tv producer , above suspicion , chaperones the young couple , and while you 're there , blam ! you take care of some Company business . It 's the perfect cover . TV producer by day , CIA operative y night .
BARRIS: I told you , I do n't have to kill people for money anymore .
BYRD: Chuck , when I said you fit our profile , very little of that had to do with you needing the money . Some of it , but very little . You liked it with Renda , Chuck . I saw it in your eyes . You liked it but you botched it . Do n't you want to get eally good at something , Chuck ? Barris stares at Byrd .
DIRECTOR: Ready one , take one . Ready three , take three . Ready one , take one .

BARRIS: Thank you . Oh , one more thing .
ACTUAL BARRIS: I felt bad about Ronnie . But really I did that ugly , fat , stupid kid a favor . He was ugly and fat and stupid . More life would n't have changed that for him . No woman would ever have loved him . That 's just the brutal truth , y'know ?
BARRIS: Olivia ?
PATRICIA: It 's Patricia , actually .
BARRIS: Sounds fun . So tell me , Patricia , why 'd you come up here tonight ?
PATRICIA: I do n't know . You 're sort of cute in a homely way . And it 's always lonely when that civilian you 're fucking calls out the name off your fake passport .
BARRIS: `` All the information I have about myself is from forged documents . ''
PATRICIA: Nabokov .
BARRIS: Actually , I just got ta go into the athroom and take care of something .

BARRIS: Hey .
BYRD: Everything go okay ? You do n't look too good .
OLIVER: Mr. Barris , do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant . Is that understood ?
BARRIS: You 're welcome , pal .
OLIVER: Do I make myself clear ?
BARRIS: Fuck you ! They 're my contestants .
OLIVER: Amateur .
BARRIS: Faggot .
BYRD: Chuck
OLIVER: Lovely . Tell me , Mr. Barris , are you in possession of my microfilm ?
BARRIS: Yeah , I got it .
OLIVER: Let 's have it then .
BARRIS: It 's up my ass , Oliver . Why do n't you each on up there and get it .
OLIVER: What do you think Patricia Watson was ?
BARRIS: Prick .
LORETTA: Well , if is n't the hitman .
BARRIS: What ?
OFFICE WORKERS: Hitman ! Hitman ! Hitman ! Hitman !
LORETTA: I said , well , if it is n't the hitman . Just heard through the grapevine that ABC is going to pick up The Newlywed Game .
BARRIS: You 're kidding me .
LORETTA: Not kidding you . Day-time and prime- time .
BARRIS: Oh , fuck , Loretta . That 's sensational ! Barris kisses Loretta .
OFFICE WORKERS: Hitman ! Hitman ! Hitman !
ACTUAL BARRIS: The Newlywed Game was based on my theory that almost any American would sell out their spouse for a washer-drier or a lawnmower you can ride on . Such was my espect for that most holy of unions . I must 've been on to something , because the show aired for thirteen years .
PENNY: Great wheels , man .
BARRIS: Yeah , I decided to start treating myself ight . You spend so much time denying yourself things . Life 's too short .
PENNY: Yeah , I really gork what you 're saying , man .
BARRIS: You really grok what I 'm saying , man . Not gork .
PENNY: Oh . Really ?
BARRIS: I 'll take it .
PENNY: Yay ! Penny happily kisses Barris .
BARRIS: Nobody serious . You ?
PENNY: No . I think we should get married .
BARRIS: Aw , Pen , do n't start
PENNY: No , listen , it makes sense . You and I feel exactly the same about marriage , ight ? How much bullshit it is , right ? And the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small . So , it makes sense .
MOTHER: We need a new ice box . The father shrugs .
ANNOUNCER: A brand new Amana refrigerator-freeze with automatic ice maker !
BARRIS: Beautiful . Did you see that ? How much they loved each other just then ? That 's what it 's all about , kiddies .
EMPLOYEE #1: Yeah . Rick took four slices of pizza at lunch yesterday . Everyone else only got two .
BARRIS: Oooh . Is that true , Rick ? Where are you ?
RICK: Here . No , it 's not true .
BARRIS: Any other witnesses to this alleged infraction ?
EMPLOYEE #2: I saw it . He took four . I only got one .
BARRIS: Rick , you 're dead meat , buddy . I sentence you to dance for us in today 's post-meeting version of `` Out of Limits '' featuring the musical stylings of the CBP Stompers . Everyone cheers .
RICK: Aw , Chuck .
BARRIS: Get up here , you rascule , you .
JIM LANGE: Sometimes Chuck would just disappear fo weeks . I remember once we had a conflict on the set over the right way to throw that kiss at the end of the show , y'know and Chuck was just not reachable to esolve it .
BARRIS: The word 's interpret .
PENNY: Interpet .
BARRIS: Interpret .
PENNY: Well , do you have an extra `` r '' then I could borrow ?
BARRIS: I 'm not going to give you a letter . You 're lucky I do n't make you forfeit a turn .
PENNY: Oh . Okay .
BARRIS: I 'll run to the store and get some more .
PENNY: All right .
BARRIS: Do n't cheat .
PENNY: You neither .
BARRIS: Intrepid .
PENNY: Shit fuck piss . Okay okay okay
BARRIS: Pen , we should call it a night . I 'm kinda tired .
PENNY: You 're tired .
BARRIS: I got a date .
PENNY: Since when ?
BARRIS: I just met this girl .
PENNY: Like , just now ? You mean just now ?
BARRIS: Yeah . Kinda .
PENNY: Well , that 's rude .
BARRIS: Sorry .
PENNY: Yeah , well , see ya Penny picks up her bag and exits in a huff .
BARRIS: Hi !
MONICA: Hi !
BARRIS: Wow , this is a beautiful place you got !
ROOMMATE: Hi .
BARRIS: Hi .
MONICA: Chuck , this is Mindy , one of my oommates .
BARRIS: Hi .
MONICA: Have a seat .
BARRIS: Yes , I have .
ACTUAL BARRIS: Yeah , I remember that religious girl , sure . Monica Something . Fleming . Oh God , she had the softest , fleeciest clam I ever experienced . It took a little more work than usual , but I got in there , aby . It was some clam . Oh Lordy . You get old , y'know , but the taste for soft clam , it just does n't go away . This is the great tragedy of getting old .
WOMAN: Getting married to Alan is the best thing I 've ever done . It 's just so wonderful knowing that you 've got someone by you side through everything for he rest of your life . The couple kisses .
LORETTA: 'kay , Mon . He 's off . Monica enters the office .
BARRIS: My sweet little clamato . Monica leans down and kisses Barris .
MONICA: I 'm pregnant . Barris 's eye twitches .
BARRIS: Is it mine ?
MONICA: I ca n't believe you asked me that .
BARRIS: I know . I 'm sorry . But you 're sure , right ?
MONICA: I hate you so much right now .
BARRIS: Look , we 'll take care of it .
MONICA: How ? Are you gon na marry me ?
BARRIS: Well , no . Not at this point .
MONICA: I 'm not murdering my baby ! I ca n't do that . Please Barris sighs . He touches Monica 's hand .
BARRIS: Beautiful country , is n't it ?
MONICA: I ca n't I ca n't I ca n't I ca n't
BARRIS: It 's okay . It 'll be okay .
PENNY: What a waste .
BARRIS: Tell me about it . I figure over the years I must 've spent close to twenty grand on these abortions airfare , hotels , doctors , gifts .
PENNY: That 's not what I meant .
BARRIS: And I do n't even know how many of these fetuses were mine . That 's what really kills me .
WOMAN #1: It was his .
WOMAN #2: Yeah . It was his .
WOMAN #3: It was n't his . I lied .
WOMAN #4: Yes , it was his baby .
WOMAN #5: Yeah .
WOMAN #6: The godamn son of a bitch . He asked you to ask me this ?
WOMAN #7: I was screwing a lot of guys at the time . It coulda been his .
WOMAN #8: Uh-uh . I just needed someone to pay fo it . He was a wallet with legs .
WOMAN #9: Yeah , I was just a kid . It ruined my life .
ACTUAL BARRIS: I do n't really want to talk about this . We hold on a silent Barris .
PENNY: So I 'm assuming this means Monica is out of the picture .
BARRIS: Yeah , I got baptized for nothing .
PENNY: Chuck , I was thinking I have this plan now , now that you 're free
BARRIS: God , you look cute today .
PENNY: I always look cute . Do n't distract me . What was I going to say ?
BARRIS: I do n't know .
PENNY: You do know . Chuck , why do n't we get married ? We 've known each other forever . We 've fucked each other forever . You think I 'm cute , you just said . You always come to me when you 're in trouble . And you 're almost forty , Chuck .
BARRIS: I know how old I almost am ! That 's it . Do n't ever ask me to marry you again !
PENNY: I wo n't .
BARRIS: I 'm sorry I yelled at you today , Pen .
PENNY: I 'm not crying because you yelled at me . This is it , is n't it ? This is us . Barris studies Penny 's face in the dim light .
ACTUAL BARRIS: I almost asked Penny to marry me right then . But I did n't .
PROSTITUTE: Is that right ?
LORETTA: Chuck ?
BARRIS: Uh .
LORETTA: Rod Flexner 's here .
BARRIS: Shit piss fuck , send him in . Flexner enters . He 's a suit .
FLEXNER: Chuck ! Great to see you .
BARRIS: What 's up , Rod ?
FLEXNER: Well , the thing is , Chuck , some of you shows are n't doing too well in the old atings war . The Family Game , for one .
BARRIS: Okay . We move into Barris 's eyes .
FLEXNER: And How 's Your Mother-in-Law is , quite frankly , in the toilet , Chuck .
BARRIS: They killed my babies . Just like that . I pushed them into the world through the irth canal of my imagination . Lovingly . Tenderly . Where 's the humanity of these people ?
BARTENDER: The fucking bastards .
BARRIS: What am I gon na do now ? Hey there , can I buy you a drink ?
LARGE MAN: What are you blind , asshole ? This lady 's with me .
BARRIS: Fuck you !
LARGE MAN: Please .
BARRIS: Get out of here , you pussy faggot piece of shit dog-shit shithead .
PENNY: Hey , I was just in the Penny sees Barris and the woman .
BARRIS: She 's
PENNY: This is our house , man . Our house ! It 's one thing to go elsewhere for your pussy needs . But this is our house !
BARRIS: This is not our house , it 's my house .
PENNY: It 's our house ! I found it with you . I decorated it for you ! I spent six months sitting on that fucking couch she 's fucking you on , fucking waiting for the fucking plumbers to come ! God , you are such an asshole !
WOMAN: I should go . This does n't feel right .
PENNY: Wan na see a stupid girl vomit ?
BARRIS: It 's not our living room , Pen .
PENNY: That 's your defense ? You know what it feels like to see you with someone else ? In any living room .
BARRIS: You know who I am , Penny . I do n't force you to hang around .
PENNY: You do n't force me ? Fuck . So you 're saying you have no interest in this , one way or the other ?
BARRIS: No , I 'm not saying that .
PENNY: Well , then , what are you saying , Chuck ? Do you want me around or not ? Do you even like me ?
BARRIS: Of course I like you .
PENNY: How much ?
BARRIS: What ?
PENNY: I need to know how much you like me .
BARRIS: I do n't even know what that means , `` how much ? '' How can I rate a person in that way ? That 's ridiculous .
PENNY: You could if you felt it . If you felt it , it would be easy to rate me . You could spread your arms as wide as they would go and say , `` This much , Penny . ''
BARRIS: Everything 's complicated , Pen . Nothing 's lack and white like that .
PENNY: Do you want me around or not ? If you do n't , just say so , so I know . Okay ?
BARRIS: I love you , Pen , in my way . Maybe not in that crazy , head-over-heels thing , but what is that , anyway ? Romantic love . Is n't that just an illusion ?
PENNY: But you just said you love me , right ?
BARRIS: Jesus , how do you know these things ?
BYRD: We even know what she actually thought it tasted like .
BARRIS: Really ? I could never find that out . What did she think ?
BYRD: It 's a `` need to know '' , my friend . So tell me , what can I do you for ?
BARRIS: I could really use an assignment , Jim . To straighten my head .
BYRD: I got something for your head .
JIM LANGE: and we 're the sending the two of you for three days and three nights to eautiful West Berlin !
BARRIS: Treesh .
PATRICIA: Leibchen . So , here 's what we got . Name 's Hans Colbert . Other side of the wall . We do n't like him very much .
BARRIS: Bye-bye , Colbert , bye-bye .
PATRICIA: You 'll work with a kraut named Keeler . He 's been trailing Colbert for a month now . Knows the routine . Keeler 's a drunk , so you stay sober and take charge .
BARRIS: Done and done . See you after ?
PATRICIA: Prove how much you love me , baby . Kill for me . Then I 'm all yours .
BARRIS: What you writing , Sig ?
KEELER: I am keeping track of all the goings on on this street .
BARRIS: Hey , Keeler , a bird just flew by .
KEELER: Yah . I know how to do my job .
BARRIS: Who is it ?
HOUSEKEEPER: Another rough night , huh ?
BARRIS: The human psyche is a wondrous thing .
HOUSEKEEPER: Yes , I know it is . We do n't need this now , do we ? Why do n't we just put this away ?
BARRIS: Mrs. Reynolds , may I rest my head on you osom for a little while ?
HOUSEKEEPER: Oh , that does n't really seem like a very good idea , Mr. Barris .
BARRIS: I 'm sorry . You 're right . I just I 'm just without comfort of any sort , and I please forgive me .
HOUSEKEEPER: No harm done . Barris smacks himself in the head .
BARRIS: Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . You are a scholar and
HOUSEKEEPER: It 's fine , sir .
BARRIS: Mrs. Reynolds , what do you suppose God thinks of someone like me ?
HOUSEKEEPER: God ?
BARRIS: Yes , God .
HOUSEKEEPER: Well , Mr. Barris , your television shows have brought laughter and joy to millions of people . That 's a very important thing , I think , in these difficult times . I would imagine God likes you very much . Barris smiles a rubber-band smile .
BARRIS: Thank you , that 's very kind . So I should get back to
HOUSEKEEPER: Yes , of course , sir . Do n't mind me .
BARRIS: I 'm really , really fucked .
PICARD: Get in .
BARRIS: What ? Who the hell are you ?
PICARD: No time . Get in or die .
BARRIS: Merde ! MERDE !
PICARD: Not to worry , my friend .
BARRIS: What the hell is that ?
PICARD: Your ride , Monsieur Barris .
BARRIS: No fucking way .
PICARD: It 's quite reliable and easy to operate . It will get you over the wall . Or you can stay here . In the German Democratic Republic . I will arrange for you to get a good factory job . No , you must fly , like Daedalus before you , to the freedom of the west .
BARRIS: Christ . What about you ?
PICARD: They do not catch me , monsieur . This is my talent , to get away always . In guerre . In amour . This is my talent , and perhaps this is my curse .
BYRD: So , did you have a nice flight ?
BARRIS: Fuck you , Jim . It was terrifying .
BYRD: Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were up to . You were there to kill Colbert , they were there to kill you . I 'm thinking we got a mole . So much hate in the world , Chuck .
BARRIS: Am I in danger still ?
BYRD: Jesus , yes . KGB did n't go out of usiness since yesterday , so far as I know . You 're fucked , Chuck . But our main concern should be if they know who you are , they know who I am .
BARRIS: Fuck off . What do we do ?
BYRD: Bow out . Lay low . That 's what I 'm gon na do . You 're lucky you have another caree to immerse yourself in .
BARRIS: Thank you . Thanks . That was great .
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: I do n't know , Chuck . It 's looking bleak .
BARRIS: There 's got ta be somebody in America with some talent . Ted Mack got bookings every week . The executives look at each other .
BARRIS: Thank you . Thank you . We 'll be in touch . That was wonderful .
EXECUTIVE #2: Chuck , it 's torture to sit through even one of these people
BARRIS: We kill 'em before they 're through . As soon as it gets unbearable , we kill 'em . Dead .
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: For God 's sake , what are you talking about ?
BARRIS: Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the act to kill 'em . And when you kill something , it stops . This I know to be true .
HOST: Why 'd you do that , Jamie ? This is someone 's grandmother . She was really trying .
JAMIE FARR: This is The Gong Show , not the Van Cliburn eliminations .
HOST: This is a human being with aspirations .
BARRIS: Oh , fuck me . This guy sucks . He 's inging everyone down . The executives eye each other .
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: None of the hosts are getting it , Chuck . But we have a thought .
BARRIS: What ?
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: You host . All the executives smile at Barris .
BARRIS: I do n't want to be on tv .
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: Listen , we ca n't sit through anymore of these test shows . Do it , Chuck , or we advise the network to pull it .
BARRIS: Ladies and Gentlemen , welcome to The Gong Show ! I 'm your host , Chuck Barris ! Ucchhh .
BIG NOSE: Why ? Why ? Why ?
BARRIS: I do n't know . I do n't understand .
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: You ca n't quit .
BARRIS: I ca n't quit ? But I get panicky , Louise , in front of all those people .
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: You lack confidence , that 's all .
BARRIS: I lack confidence ?
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: But we 'll take care of that . We 'll get you some confidence powder . Leave that to us .
BARRIS: Confidence powder ?
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: Nose candy , Chuck . Blow . Snow . Flake .
BARRIS: Blow , snow , flake ?
EXECUTIVE: Coke .
BARRIS: Oh . Coke . Okay . Does that work ?
GENE GENE: Oh yeah , a real Jekyll and Hyde . Sometimes nice as you please . Give you the shirt off his back . Other times he 'd ant like a crazy man . I remember once he screamed at me that I did n't know anything about dancing . `` Nijinsky , '' he yelled , `` now there was a dancer ! ''
BLACK COMEDIAN: Today I had a bad day today
JAMIE FARR: Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy . I think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this sort of spastic moron . I remember at the time I was eading Wittgenstein . And Chuck was just thrilled to have someone else in addition to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff with .
BARRIS: Look , Jamie , you know as well as I that language does not exist without an outward criteria .
PATRICIA: Chuck
BARRIS: Can we pick up tomorrow ?
JAMIE FARR: Yeah . But consider my thinking on elementary propositions . I 'm serious .
BARRIS: Will do . Love ya .
JAMIE FARR: Right back at ya , amigo .
PATRICIA: I 'm concerned about you . I think you need to get back into the life . Our sex was always amazing after you killed . Truth is you 're not that great after you discussions with Jamie Farr . The phone rings .
BARRIS: Jamie , I ca n't talk anymore tonight
PATRICIA: Dinner sounds good with whom ?
BARRIS: Keeler .
KEELER: A very fancy place .
BARRIS: Only the best for my friend .
KEELER: The friendships one develops during wartime are remarkably strong .
BARRIS: Yes . There is an awkward silence .
KEELER: So how is the business of television ?
BARRIS: Well , it 's hit and miss . I 've got a new show called `` Operation Entertainment '' which I believe is going to kill . It 's sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops thing , but it 's weekly and Keeler is staring right through Barris .
KEELER: Why do you do what you do , Chuck ?
BARRIS: Well , I like to think that I bring joy and laughter to millions of people . I 'm not saying that my shows are as good as they could be . Yet . But
KEELER: Why do you kill ? Barris looks around , clears his throat .
BARRIS: Oh .
KEELER: During the second world war , I had the pleasure of killing . Yes , pleasure . I found it exhilirating . Afterwards , I could find nothing else to fill me so much with life . So I became what I am today . I wanted the exhiliration again of death . The waiter appears .
WAITER: Are you gentlemen ready to order ?
KEELER: I 'll have the shrimp scampi and a green salad .
WAITER: And for you , sir .
KEELER: Um , Just give me a steak . Rare .
WAITER: Thank you .
KEELER: `` Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy whole might . Work while it is called , for the night cometh wherein no man can work . ''
BARRIS: That 's Carlyle !
KEELER: Yes .
BARRIS: It 's amazing you should quote him . He 's my hero .
KEELER: I read in a book recently that killing your first man is like making love to your first woman . Every smell , every nuance , you remember with a special allure , as if the acts had occured outside civilization , outside time . And when the allure is gone , you are condemned .
BARRIS: Condemned ?
KEELER: I am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization . You will be too , my good friend . Barris looks into Keeler 's hollow eyes .
ACTUAL BARRIS: The next day I heard Keeler offed himself .
PENNY: When you called , I was n't gon na come .
BARRIS: I 'm glad you did , Pen .
PENNY: I said to myself , enough . Enough of this jerk already . Enough .
BARRIS: I could see how you would feel that way .
PENNY: But I 've come upon something interesting through my delvings into human psychology . It 's called TA , Transactual Analysis .
BARRIS: Transactional Analysis .
PENNY: Now see , by correcting me you 're esponding as `` Parent '' to my `` Child . '' `` Here 's the proper way to say this word , Penny . '' But that 's okay . As long as we oth understand that 's what you 're doing . Y'know , I 'm okay , you 're okay . So what 's wrong , Chuck ? Are you okay ?
BARRIS: A guy I knew killed himself last night .
PENNY: My God . Everyone you know kills themselves . Or tries . Who is it this time ?
BARRIS: You do n't know him . A stagehand .
PENNY: Why 'd he do it ?
BARRIS: He did n't like his work anymore .
PENNY: Is being a stagehand really bad o something ?
BARRIS: Yeah , it 's pretty bad . Patricia storms up to the table .
PATRICIA: You were supposed to meet me at The Palm two hours ago .
BARRIS: Oh fuck , I forgot .
PENNY: Who is this ?
PATRICIA: I do not get stood up . Do you understand ?
BARRIS: Um , Penny , this is Patricia . How did you find me ?
PATRICIA: Are you serious ? That 's what I do for a living .
PENNY: Who 's Patricia ? What does she mean , that 's what she does for a living ?
PATRICIA: You 're dead in my book , Strawberry-dick .
PENNY: Strawberry dick ? What 's that ?
PATRICIA: There is no second chance . Get it ? Nice meeting you , Penny . I 've heard a lot about you . Oh , by the by , Byrd 's dead .
PENNY: And and okay I 'm only gon na give you one more chance , man . That 's it . Get it ?
BARRIS: Who sent you ? ! Who the fuck sent you ? !
TEENAGE BOY: Nobody , man . We just waited for you to leave after the show . We just think the show is cool . We just think you 're cool . The girl is crying .
TEENAGE GIRL: Please do n't kill us .
UNKNOWN COMIC: Hey , Chuck .
BARRIS: Take it off .
UNKNOWN COMIC: Huh ?
BARRIS: The fucking bag . Take it off .
BARRIS: Here he is , the Prince of Puns , the Wizard of Whoopee The Unknown Comic !
UNKNOWN COMIC: Chuckie Baby , Chuckie Baby , Chuckie Baby
BARRIS: What ? What do you want ?
UNKNOWN COMIC: What 's the difference between toilet paper and a shower curtain ?
BARRIS: I do n't know .
UNKNOWN COMIC: Here 's the guy !
BARRIS: Get out of here .
UNKNOWN COMIC: You 're fucking crazy , man .
LORETTA: Phone call from someone named Tuvia .
BARRIS: Who ? !
LORETTA: Tuvia ?
BARRIS: I 'll take it ! Do n't hang up ! Barris picks up the phone .
GUY: Hey , Chuck , I got a talent .
GUY: Just take a second .
TUVIA: You look great .
BARRIS: What ?
TELEPHONE VOICE: Paul Picard is dead .
PICARD: Fly , Daedalus , fly !
BARRIS: This is the moment we 've been waiting for The contestants appear on stage .
ED ASNER: And the winner is Taxi !
STARLET: I do n't see why your shows are neve nominated .
JAMES L.BROOKS: And I honor you , members of the academy , for recognizing and supporting high quality television .
ACTUAL BARRIS: But as I stood there , I realized , I could n't kill Jim Brooks , the man who was esponsible for such good stuff Mary Tyler Moore , Rhoda , Cindy , Phyllis , episodes of My Friend Tony . I loved those shows as much as anybody in America .
BARRIS: Hey , congratulations , Jim .
JAMES L.BROOKS: Oh , hey ! Thanks
BARRIS: Chuck Barris . The Gong Show .
JAMES L.BROOKS: Oh , right . Hey , thanks , Chuck .
BARRIS: Once again you deserve it . Your shows are the greatest . You bring so much quality to the medium .
JAMES L.BROOKS: Thank you . I appreciate that . I really do
BARRIS: Yeah .
PRETTY WOMAN: Hi .
BARRIS: Hi .
PRETTY WOMAN: I thought it was you .
BARRIS: It 's me .
PRETTY WOMAN: I 'm glad to meet you because I wanted to tell you that I 've seen The Gong Show and I think you are the most insidious and despicable force in entertainment today .
BARRIS: Well
PRETTY WOMAN: How dare you subject the rest of the world to your loathsome view of humanity .
BARRIS: I do n't think it 's that loathsome .
PRETTY WOMAN: What is it then ? To mock some poor , lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives . To destroy them . So everybody 's not brilliantly talented . They 're still people . They deserve respect and compassion . I mean , who the hell are you ? What the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the pathetic masses ? Oh , I forgot , you created The Dating Game . Wow , right up there with the Sistine Chapel . I guess that 's what gives you the right to
BARRIS: Excuse me , I 've got to
FAT BACHELOR: I only want to be loved .
BARRIS: That 's all I fucking wanted !
BARRIS: No , I 'm
ACTUAL BARRIS: That was it . I just disappeared . The network had to put The Gong Show into eruns . It was 1981 . I holed myself up in this hotel in New York . Parker Hotel .
BARRIS: Who Am I ?
OLIVER: Barris .
BARRIS: How 'd you know where I was ?
OLIVER: Chuck , Chuck , Chuck , do n't be an orangutan . We always know where you are . We always know what you 're doing . By the y , I 'd think twice before I 'd attempt to get that tripe you 're writing published . And there 's a typo on page
BARRIS: Look , what do you want , Oliver ? I do n't work for you anymore . I have things to Barris trails off .
OLIVER: I 'd like you to come back for one last assignment , Chuck .
BARRIS: No . Now get Good-bye
OLIVER: I think you might be interested when I tell you it 's the mole who fingered you friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard and Seigfried Keeler .
BARRIS: Keeler committed suicide .
OLIVER: Yes , of course he did . He threw himself from a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an electrical cord .
BARRIS: I 'm not interested , Oliver .
OLIVER: As long as the mole 's alive , you do n't have a chance in hell of remaining so . Besides , killing is in your blood , old man . You fit the profile .
BARRIS: That fucking profile again ! What 's the fuck is it ? ! What the fuck do you astards know about me , that I do n't ? !
OLIVER: Indeed . Where to begin . First , let go of me .
BARRIS: That 's not true .
OLIVER: Oh , and your father the dentist ? Not eally your father . Your biological father was a man named Edmund James Windsor . A serial killer . A fact you mother did n't know when she had an affai with him in 1930 . If you want to look him up , he was also known as the Tarrytown Troll , because he had been described by witnesses as short and ugly . Windsor died in the electrical chair at Ossining in 1939 . We believed your self- loathing tendencies coupled with that extra Y chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would serve us well .
BARRIS: You 're lying .
OLIVER: I 'm trying to think what more I can tell you . I 'm sure there 's more . But you have me at a disadvantage here , Barris . I do n't have your files in front of me .
BARRIS: Just leave me the hell alone !
OLIVER: Your mother always loved the game shows , and you so wanted to please her . We never expected the game show business to work out for you . But that it did , turned out to be in our favor . I guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we anticipated .
BARRIS: Huh ? What ?
PENNY: You sent me your last letter on hotel stationary .
BARRIS: Oh . Well , it 's great to see you , Pen . You look beautiful . Barris hugs her .
PENNY: I do n't really . But I appreciate the lie . I know how you hate lying . Boy , this place is scary looking .
BARRIS: Yeah . The human psyche .
PENNY: I came to take you back to California with me . It 's a lonely state without you .
BARRIS: I do n't know , Redhead .
PENNY: I ca n't wait forever for you to ask me to marry you , you know . Well , apparently I can . But I really do n't want to . Chuck .
BARRIS: Pen .
PENNY: I love you so much . You do n't understand . I do n't even know why . You 're such a schmuck .
BARRIS: You do n't know the half of it .
PENNY: You 're not gon na marry me , are you ?
BARRIS: I do n't know if I can .
PATRICIA: I ca n't believe you finally left your two- hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me . I 'm honored .
BARRIS: Y'know , I got a visit this morning from Penny . She 's wanted to marry me forever . But she does n't know who I am , what I 've , what I 'm capable of .
BARRIS: I hate myself for how I 've lived , Treesh .
PATRICIA: Neitzsche said , `` Whoever despises oneself still respects oneself as one who despises . ''
BARRIS: I never thought of that . Jesus , I ca n't even despise myself with any insight .
PATRICIA: Insane asylums are filled with people who think they 're Jesus or Satan . Very few have delusions of being the guy down the lock who works at an insurance company . Wonder what that means .
BARRIS: Y'know , I wanted to be a writer once . I wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote . But I never did . I 'm the lesser person , Treesh . I never said anything meaningful that was n't said by somebody else first . I am disposable . I disposed of people and I am disposable . You look cold .
PATRICIA: Chuck , what 's gotten into you ? You 're actually acting like a gentleman .
BARRIS: I suppose you still wo n't tell me where you 're staying .
PATRICIA: No . But I 'll show you . She takes his hand . They walk off .
BARRIS: Sure . Bourbon .
PATRICIA: I 've been thinking a lot about you lately , Chuck .
BARRIS: Yeah ?
PATRICIA: I 've missed you .

PATRICIA: Well , I 've mellowed .
BARRIS: That sounds right .

PENNY: Operation Entertainment .
BARRIS: Yeah , Operation Entertainment . The Rah- Rah Show , Gong Show , The Dollar-Ninety- Eight Beauty Show , The Ra-Rah Show
PENNY: You said that already .
BARRIS: Okay . Okay , but what you do n't know is that I 've brutally murdered thirty-three people for the CIA .
ACTUAL BARRIS: Y'know , I came up with a new game show idea recently . It 's called The Old Game . You got three old guys with loaded guns on stage They look back at their lives , see who they were , what they accomplished , how close they came to ealizing their dreams . The winner is the one who does n't blow his brains out . He gets a refrigerator .

BIG AL: Hey , Jake When am I gon na get to play the Inside ?
JAKE: Gordo plays the inside . You 're the Shill .
BIG AL: Yeah , but come on All I get to do is cry and get insulted .
JAKE: What are you talking about ? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do . We got it down cold , Al . You do n't want to jinx it by changing something up , do you ?
BIG AL: I ' m gon na go get eggrolls . Anyone want eggrolls ? Al slaps Jake on the back and exits . Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder .
JAKE: What ? I can feel you looking at me .
GORDO: That 's a lot of cash . He came up with it pretty quick .
JAKE: Probably some investment banker o convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead . Did you see how fast he ran out of here ? It 's done . He 's not coming back .
GORDO: I guess . I got ta drop a dime . Did anybody mess up the hoop ?
MILES: It 's clean . Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway .
JAKE: Ten percent .
SOBOZINSKI: You guys got sack , I 'll give you that much .
JAKE: Confidence . It 's just confidence .
ROTTOVICH: Feels a little light , Jake . Next time we 're in for twenty .

JAKE: What are you talking about ? Ten 's standard .
ROTTOVICH: Yeah Well , Sobo 's kid needs braces .
SOBOZINSKI: Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture ?
JAKE: We got a good thing going here . You want to blow it over an overbite ?
ROTTOVICH: Do n't get me wrong , Jake . I like you oys . You guys are the steadiest usiness in town . But what can I say ? Twenty percent 's still better than what we give to any of the othe criminals .
JAKE: All the shit we pulled with you and you 're trying to shake us down ? You guys got sack .
ROTTOVICH: Was that a threat ? Did I hear a threat ?
MILES: Cops
BUTCH: Grifters
JAKE: We ca n't all be model citizens such as yourself .
BUTCH: It 's all about the money , is n't it ?
JAKE: Is n't it always ?
CALL GIRL: Are you ready for me , Ralph ?
GORDO: I just do n't know if this says , `` me '' . What 's the fabric ?
BIG AL: It 's Alfonse . I want to settle up . I have n't been ducking you . I told you I 'd get it .
LILY: Oops .
ANSWERING MACHINE: You have no new messages .
JAKE: Dumb fucking luck . Jake stares out the window after the bird .
LUPUS: Mr. Dolby . King would like a word with you .
LIONEL: R-r-right now ?
LUPUS: Please . We have a car waiting . I apologize for the door .
JAKE: Yeah .
MILES: I was supposed to meet him for breakfast . He likes that new IHOP they just opened , you know He likes to order that thing . The Rutti-Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got .
JAKE: Miles
MILES: Sorry . I 'm just Look what they did to him . Right in the middle of his egg- foo-young .
GORDO: Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night . They just pulled him out of the East River .
JAKE: Well , this is just fucking great
GORDO: It gets worse . Now I know why he was such a good rope . X mean , cash . That much and we never had to put him on the `` Send ? '' Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin .
MILES: Who 's that ?
GORDO: The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money . He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday . ` Cept this time , he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King 's money back before any ody says `` boo . ''
MILES: What 's a King Pin ?
GORDO: Currently , the King Pin is a very large- type pole stuck up our asses .
MTLES: Mob ?
GORDO: Independant . Same shit , just independant . They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book Big . Fat . Bald .
MILES: So what ? We hide , right ?
GORDO: What are you ? New ? Let me tell you how good this guy is . Last night , Al calls this bookie to settle up . Apparently he 's been ducking him fo like a month . So the guy asks him where he 's got all this money all of a sudden , ight ? What does Al do ?
MILES: You 're pissed we did n't get credit ?
GORDO: No , that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said ! Except anybody that 's ever met Big A1 knows that the only thing he 's comfortable doing alone is eating . This guys tells this guy , that guy tells some other guy , eventually it works it 's way back to someone who works for the King and
INSERT SHOT: INT- BIG AL 'S APARTMENT- NIGHT
MILES: We sure Big Al threw him to us ?
GORDO: Come on
JAKE: A bird flew into my house last night .
MILES: Just an idea , but let 's just fucking split . We 'll meet up anywhere . Akron or Austin or Atlanta . Anywhere
JAKE: He 'll find us . We go talk to him .
GORDO: Whoa . What ?
MILES: We 're going to give him the money back ?
JAKE: You know what we 're doing with the money .
GORDO: And what about Big Al ?
JAKE: Leave him . Someone 's going to find him eventually . Then they 'll start looking for us , too . A WAITRESS approaches .
WAITRESS: What can I get you guys ?
MILES: Coffee . And a valium . Jake turns his attention out the window .
JAKE: That 's it ?
GORDO: When ?
JAKE: Tonight . Just me .
MILES: Fuck that . We 're going too .
GORDO: Alright , let 's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second . Is this the est thing to do ? Jake levels a stare at Gordo for a second .
JAKE: Meet me at my place later .
MILES: How do you know the King 's going to let you walk ?
JAKE: I 'm getting a ride .
SOBOZINSKI: The King , huh ? Nice going .
JAKE: I try .
ROTTOVICH: Do n't dick around too long . And if he stabs you or shoots you or causes any other form of profuse bleeding , call a cab because you are not getting back in this car !
HARLIN: We appreciate your punctuality . Mr. King is expecting you .
LUPUS: What ? You said pat him down , I 'm pattin ' him down .
HARLIN: It only takes a moment to be polite . My apologies , Mr. Vig . If you would n't mind ? Jake steps back and raises his arms .
JAKE: You the one that did it ? You the one that got Al ?
HARLIN: Mr. King prefers to farm out for that kind of work . Please , after you .
JAKE: Uh Which one 's the King Pin ?
HARLIN: He 's in the back taking a steam .
KING PIN: Ow ! Watch the pinkie !
JAKE: Jake . You can call me Jake . Here and there .
KING PIN: Here and there , Scooter ? Here and there like Boston , Chicago , Houston ? The bay area ? Some action in London , ` til it turned nickel and dime . Or how about that little stint down in Miami ? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there . You guy 's pretty good ?
JAKE: I have a good crew .
KING PIN: Minus one . Jake visibly bristles
JAKE: Minus one .
KING PIN: You know , back in the day , grafting was considered a gentleman 's racket . Good suits , good food The Underworld of the Underworld . A grifter had to survive on his wits , his instincts I like that . I like the idea of that . These days , things being what they are , guys like me got ta stay low .
JAKE: I guess it lacks a certain style .
KING PIN: Of course , your line of work 's only as good as the people you find .
JAKE: You ca n't cheat an honest man .
KING PIN: You ca n't cheat an honest man . But a man like Lionel Dolby
JAKE: I apologize for the inconvenience . The King picks up a long , metal nail file .
KING PIN: Honest mistake . Just give me the money ack and all will be forgiven .
JAKE: I ca n't do that .
KING PIN: Why not ?
JAKE: Let me rephrase I won ` t do that .
KING PIN: Let me repeat Why not ?
JAKE: Because you killed one of my crew .
KING PIN: Buddy , that was business . Besides , you have more crew . Then there 's you
JAKE: I 'll get the money back , plus interest . I go on the grift for you . You get a cat , I get a cut . And we get square .
KING PIN: Fucking grifters ! I love it ! You got alls , I 'll give you that much .
JAKE: No . Just confidence .
KING PIN: I ' ll be honest with you , Kid . A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit , cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me ? First thing I have to ask myself is , is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me ? You tried it once .
JAKE: We got caught . So you know it wo n't happen again .
KING PIN: I know it wo n't happen because you 're going to feel like a Prom Queen who just got gang fucked by the wrestling team !
HARLIN: Mr. Vig arrived with an escort . NYPD .
KING PIN: Grifters Always working an angle . Alright . I can see you got some vision . But I give you the Mark . I tell you the who and you give me the how . Lupus go with him . Lupus snaps to attention .
LUPUS: What ?
KING PIN: Consider him part of your crew . Consider him a part of me .
JAKE: Why ?
KING PIN: You ask a lot of questions . Come on . Let me see ` em .
JAKE: I 'm not saying anything . Besides , you 're one to talk . You 're the one who 's got me on my knees in a dark alley .
BUTCH: And these cops ? What do they get ?
SOBOZINSKI: What are we gon na do with this stuff anyway ? Heroin ? What the hell do you do with heroin ?
ROTTOVICH: You sell it .
SOBOZINSKI: To who ?
ROTTOVICH: Do n't be an idiot . How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer 's drugs to another drug dealer ? If Vig 's ight , we might be looking at a hundred , maybe a hundred fifty grand
SOBOZINSKI: You think this is a good idea ? We neve did this kinda shit before .
ROTTOVICH: What 's he going to do ? File a missing drugs report ? If it works out , this guy might be good for a few more turns .
SOBOZINSKI: Hope so . Those fucking orthodontist ills are killing me . One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up . One fifty ! It 's not even covered .
ROTTOVICH: It 's cosmetic . They do n't cove cosmetic .
ROTTOVICH: Bullshit it 's cosmetic ! My fucking tooth was cracked in half . I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity . The department 's dental is fo shit .
SOBOZINSKI: Whoa , whoa There he is .
MOONAN: Confessions of a poor brusher .
SOBOZINSKI: You know who we are ?
KID: The heat .
ROTTOVICH: That 's right . We 're the heat .
KID: Something for my Pops .
ROTTOVICH: I see . Well , your Pops has been making you carry around drugs for him . We 're going to have to take them .
KID: My Pops is going to be mad .
ROTTOVICH: Give the kid a twenty .
SOBOZINSKI: What 's the world coming to ? Everybody 's on the friggin ' take
BUTCH: Keeping the Fix happy .
JAKE: You never know when you can use a crooked cop .
BUTCH: Keep going . I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby .
JAKE: So you want to know how to play the Big Con .
BUTCH: In this case , you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con .
JAKE: Does n't matter what the con is . Insider trading , a line we got on a ookie club , insurance scam , whatever You saw the money and you want it . More of it . Who cares if you have to bend the rules a little ? As long as no one gets hurt .
GORDO: I 've been shot . Oh . The humanity . Big Al sits cowering at a table
BIG AL: God . No . Please . Do n't kill me . Miles casually washing glasses
MILES: You better hurry . The police will be here any second . I do n't really understand my motivation with this . Why am I washing glasses ?
JAKE: Now you 're an accomplice in a homicide . Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg .
DOLBY: What about The money ?
JAKE: Then there it is again That little itch . There 's a guy holding a smoking gun , a guy bleeding all over the floo and still , all you can think about is the money . You twisted fuck . So we got ta give you the `` Blow-off '' . We make sure that you never , ever want to look for us again . We get you off our backs . Forever .
BUTCH: So how 'd you get caught ?
JAKE: Suits used to say that in any con , sooner or later someone 's going to start asking the right questions . Usually , it takes a little longer .
MILES: Wait a second Who 's the mope ?
LUPUS: I 'm the King 's eyes and ears . Just in case you decide to get cute .
MILES: So we got ta short con our way out of a hundred and fifty grand ? That could only take like , a year .
JAKE: No . Big con . One rag . One rag and we get out from under all this . But we need another Shill .
MILES: What do we need another Shill for ?
JAKE: Breasts .
JAKE: Oops . Jake takes her by the arm out to
LILY: What is this ? You guys cops o something ?
JAKE: We 're not cops .
GORDO: You got ta be kidding me . Her ?
JAKE: Yes , her . Where 's my wallet ?
LILY: Your what ?
JAKE: You interested in a little work ?
LILY: Sorry about your wallet , but if you think I 'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars , a waxed out Visa and a ad fake I.D. , you 're fucking crazy . Jake .
JAKE: Take a deep breath and count to ten . It 's not that kind of work . You 're Lily , right ?
LILY: Says who ?
JAKE: You 're working Daffy 's block . He was going to break your kneecaps . Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes . I told him you were with us , so that 's two you owe me .
LILY: Oooh . Sassy . What do you care who feels me up , Jake ? Unless it kinda gotcha going . Did it , Jake ? Getcha going ? Lily saunters to Jake with a seductive grin .
MILES: Is it just me or is there something eally hot about a girl telling you to go fuck yourself ?
JAKE: Alright ! Hold up . You win . You got the job .
LILY: Gee thanks . Now I do n't have to find that bridge to jump off . Jake catches up and blocks Lily 's way .
JAKE: We had to see what your deal was . I 'm just a little superstitious .
LILY: Here 's my deal Do n't waste my time . What do you want me for anyway ? You do n't even know me .
JAKE: I just have a good feeling about you . Have n't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before ?
LILY: No . What 's my cut ?
JAKE: You get an equal cut .
LILY: What do I have to do ?
JAKE: Just play a part . A little acting . Lily steps back and hails a cab .
LILY: Make a wish .
BUTCH: I can see why you liked her .
JAKE: That was it . We had our crew . Now we needed the Mark .
MILES: Why ?
JAKE: Because that 's who the King Fin wants us to fleece . And Gillette 's perfect
JAKE: Most of his money 's clean . A lot of it is n't . The best part is that we know exactly where it is .
GORDO: How much we going after ?
JAKE: Two million . Miles lets out a whistle .
GORDO: We only owe the King a hundred and fifty .
JAKE: We get fifty percent . And we get clea of the King . Jake looks over at Lupus for confirmation .
LUPUS: That 's worth it right there . You ask me , I do n't think you can do it .
MILES: I 'm with Jack LaLane . That guy 's untouchable .
JAKE: That 's why we do n't go after him directly .
MILES: This might just be me , but that is hands down , the dumbest fucking idea I 've ever heard .
GORDO: People have tried this before , Jake . It 's never worked . Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it . Last year , Mumps got pinched in L.A .
JAKE: It never worked before because A , they did n't flush the bank enough ; B , thei corporate papers were for shit ; C , they did n't have someone on the inside with Customs .
MILES: Yeah , or D , it 's a dumb fucking idea
JAKE: Then what do you want to do , Miles ? Run ?
MILES: We never had a problem with that before .
JAKE: Yeah , well we never had this kind of problem before .
MILES: What are you talking about ? Yes we have . And we would have been beautiful about it . We would 've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it . Then we woulda moved on ` til the next local putz caught on .
JAKE: We 're getting a little old fo unning .
MILES: Yeah , well we 're still a little young for Albany State Prison . Are you pissed about Al ? I 'm pissed too , but I ' m not like `` twenty-five to life '' pissed .
JAKE: I 'm getting clear of this . If you 're not going to do it for the fucking principle , do it for the money . Gordo ?
GORDO: Yeah Whatever , Jake .
JAKE: No , not `` whatever . '' You 're either in o you ' re out . A silence falls over everyone .
LILY: I 'm in .
BUTCH: But there were other factors .
JAKE: Factors that were n't clear to me until now .
MOONAN: Gentlemen ? Special Agent Gunther Moonan .
ROTTOVICH: Special Agent ?
MOONAN: You are Officer Richard Rottovich . And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski . I 'm looking for Jake Vig .
SOBOZINSKI: Who ?
MOONAN: I 've been looking for this Jake Vig fo some time now . Problem is , the guy 's the invisible man . A spook , a spectre , a ghost . Then , like a gift , Jake 's good buddy and member of his crew , Alfonse Moorely , is found the other day with a hole in his head .
ROTTOVICH: Look Special Agent Moonan We do n't know what you 're talking about .
MOONAN: Oh yeah , I almost forgot . The two serious looking gentlemen outside ? Internal Affairs .
SOBOZINSKI: What do you want ?
MOONAN: You help me catch him . Whatever he 's into next , I want you to be into . And what you 're into , I 'm into . If it all goes well , those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape . I 'll clear you guys of anything you 've eve done with Vig under the guise of some cross-departmental investigation . This prick 's been on the wish list for so long , you 'll probably get gold shields out of it .
SOBOZINSKI: What do you get out of it ?
MOONAN: Peace of mind .
SOBOZINSKI: That 's it ?
MOONAN: Not everyone 's on the take , Walter .
ROTTOVICH: If you Feds are so hot for him , why do n't we just bring him in right now ?
MOONAN: I want him for something big and to do that , we have to catch him in the act .
SOBOZINSKI: This guy must have been a real pain in your dick .
MOONAN: Literally . It 's not a bad deal , gentleman . I get peace of mind . You get Detective Sheilds . But this is the est part , Walter Walter , you daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile . Capice ? Rottovich and Sobozinski remain silent .
JAKE: He 's just as crooked as the next guy . You 'd think he 'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars .
BUTCH: Cue the fucking violins . Come on It 's getting cold .
MILES: Am I the only one who feels like we ca n't make a move with this guy on us ?
LILY: We should ditch him .
JAKE: Just watch every thing you say around him . Every word , every move It all goes back to the King Pin .
GORDO: How 's the hoop , superstar ? Clean ?
LUPUS: What is it with you and bathrooms ?
MILES: He does n't like using a bathroom unless he knows it 's clean .
LILY: Manly .
GORDO: You laugh now , but wait until you need a clean place to powder . This is New York city , Sister . Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda . You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob ? Let 's do the list Hepatitis , influenza , the flesh eating disease-
JAKE: Here 's what 's going to happen . Gordo , we need to find a guy in Gillette 's ank . Miles , we need papers , corporate , insurance
MILES: Is it all fugasi ?
JAKE: No , the corporate papers have to be legit . But you got ta score an I.D . A clean one . Talk to Suits . I got ta get us a Banker .
LILY: What about Customs ?
JAKE: I 'll worry about Customs .
LILY: Hey , I ' m not just along for the ride , so I do n't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut .
JAKE: Take a deep breath . You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend o something . Jake rolls his eyes as Lily glares at him .
KING PIN: How much ?
JAKE: I think two million .
KING PIN: What do you need from me ? Permission ? Go ! If you can fleece him for two million , then do it , Kid .
JAKE: I need you to stake me .
KING PIN: Stake you ?
JAKE: I need you to stake me . I ca n't do it without it . It 's just a couple hundred grand . Taken out of our cut when we 're done . King Pin eyes Jake suspiciously for a second .
KING PIN: That 's more than you already owe me . What happens if you fuck this up ?
JAKE: Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
KING PIN: Hey Skippy ? Do I have the word `` chump '' tattooed on my forehead ?
LILY: Mr . King , I think-
JAKE: Hey , I got it ! Take some mental notes . You just might learn something here . Lily just shrugs and rolls her eyes .
KING PIN: Listen , Scooter-
JAKE: No , you listen . We 're partners now and even though I 'm running the show fo you , I 'm still running the show . That means I get a little respect . So I do n't want to hear anymore of this Scooter , Buddy , Junior , Skippy , Tiger , ullshit . It 's Jake .
JAKE: And I got ta tell you , for a guy who spends all his time in a gym , you could be in better shape .
KING PIN: Take off your shirt . Jake looks behind him to see Harlin looming .
JAKE: Excuse me ?
KING PIN: I said take off your fucking shirt .
JAKE: Fine . You want me to take it off , I 'll take it off .
KING PIN: Look at you , you skinny prick .
JAKE: You 're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything , are you ?
KING PIN: Come here . Feel this .
JAKE: No thanks . I 'm good .
KING PIN: Come here !
LILY: You guys are freaking me out .
KING PIN: Shut up . Feel that ? That 's solid muscle . Not an ounce of fat . Go ahead . Punch it .
JAKE: I am not going The King starts to get that look again .
KING PIN: Come on . Harder .
JAKE: I think I just broke my hand .
KING PIN: Harder . Remember , I killed your buddy .
JAKE: You get all that ?
BUTCH: Nice .
JAKE: We got our stake . Now we need to find our guy in Gillett 's bank .
MILES: Michelle Strigo . Loan officer .

JAKE: Now we had the con and the mark . We needed to look the part
FRANKIE: Last of the red hot grifters .
JAKE: We need wardrobe . FRANKIE So I see . In from Long Island ? You fellas take a look around .
GORDO: Hey Suits ? You got anything in like a eleven or twelve ounce Super 100 worsted ?
SUITS: Corporate papers with the New York State seal , insurance documents with a proof of bonding and some fugasi financial ecords . There 's also the I.D . you asked for . Corporate papers with the New York State seal , insurance documents with a proof of bonding and some fugasi financial records . There 's also the I.D . you asked for .
JAKE: Aces , Suits .
SUITS: Not easy pickin 's . Papers like these speak to larger issues . Sorry about Alfonse . You into something big ?
JAKE: Pretty much .
SUITS: In over your head ?
JAKE: Pretty much . Suits eyes Lily .
SUITS: Can I speak to you in confidence ?
JAKE: Huh ? Oh . She 's alright . Suits gives Lily another suspicious look .
SUITS: Try and keep up You ask for the Advantage Goods , then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps . So I got ta think you 're either working the mace o playing the Jug Mob .

I 'm telling you , this is it . Yeah I figured you 'd feel that way . So here 's the deal Call Kylie over at the Bureau . Tell him I got something that might interest him . A guy they call the King Pin . I think there may be a corruption case brewing here , too That 's right . So even if I do n't get Vig , you 'll still have something to show . Rottovich and Sobozinski enter .
SOBOZINSKI: Whaddya mean ? We got dick .
MOONAN: You guy 's are not working with me here . I just got off the phone with my boss . After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole , he let me know exactly how little I 'm welcome ack if we come up short . And now here you guys are , WASTING MY FUCKING TIME ! Moonan kicks a chair across the floor .
ROTTOVICH: Like we told you before , we think he 's into something with the King Pin-
MOONAN: Look , I 'm not a confrontational person y nature .
JAKE: Thanks . Did you know you should n't light three cigarettes with a match ?
BUTCH: You 're a superstitious fucker .
JAKE: Luck 's a funny thing . Especially the ad .
BUTCH: Like what ?
JAKE: Having a gun pointed at you for one . It 's not like breaking a mirror bad luck , but it 's bad . Three on a match , lack cats Believe it . Believe it all .
MILES: Where the hell is she ?
JAKE: FUCK ! Gordo , Lupus and Miles look up at Lily .
GORDO: Oh shit .
LILY: Nice to see you too . Why are you getting so bent ? She takes a step into the apartment .
JAKE: You just put a mother of a jinx on us .
LILY: Lighten up .
JAKE: You have no idea what you 've done do you ? No idea ! What is this ? Jake points to her hair .
LILY: You told me to change my hair !
JAKE: What about this ? Do you have any idea what this means ? You 've killed us . We 're dead !
LILY: Did I miss something ?
GORDO: The red hair It 's bad luck .
MILES: It 's not like she 's a real redhead , Jake
JAKE: Like that matters ! You ca n't fool bad luck ! You ca n't get by on a technicality ! You ca n't trick karma !
LILY: So much for that good feeling , huh ? Silence . Jake can feel the eyes on him .
JAKE: Anybody says a word I swear to God Jake takes off after her .
BUTCH: She had you tempting fate .
JAKE: My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy . The same numbers everyday for sixteen years . One day he gets pissed off , tells them he 's out and plays his own numbers . They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million . LILY steps out from behind Butch .
LILY: Guess he passed on that unlucky- asshole gene .
GORDO: She up for this ?
JAKE: She 's up for it .
ASHBY: Uh , no . Please .
BLONDE: Thanks .
LILY: But I 'm not that late . You did n't have to give away my seat .
ASHBY: I was n't sure if you 'd make it .
BLONDE: Oh , I did n't know you Here . Sorry . Lily takes the barstool back .
LILY: No problem .
ASHBY: Tough day ?
LILY: Brutal day . They say the streets are lined with money down here , but I guess you have to know the secret handshake . What are you drinking ?
ASHBY: Uh , Maker 's Mark . Rocks .
LILY: Oh god . I 'm overbearing and rude . Lily . Lily Finn .
ASHBY: So , what do you do ?
LILY: It 's more like what are n't I doing . My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company . We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley , but then again who has n't up there .
ASHBY: Silicon Valley ?
LILY: That 's right . So , brainiacs that we are , we thought we 'd be innovative and elocate east . Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here .
ASHBY: I can-
LILY: On me . For the seat . Cheers .
ASHBY: Well , typically , corporate loans are elatively simple matters , but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery . Lily arches an eyebrow at Ashby .
LILY: Do n't tell me you started a tech firm here before us .
ASHBY: No , no . Nothing like that . I work in a bank .
LILY: Really ? Wish we had met eight hours ago .
ASHBY: Oh . Well , thanks for the drink .
LILY: You 're welcome . I was just going to ask you if you 'd like to join us . Ashby ightens again .
GORDO: So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director 's office and says `` The code 's fine , the program 's fo shit '' and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy 's desk ! They all break out into LAUGHTER .
JAKE: So this is our boss , right ? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he 's yelling and screaming , `` You 're fired ! Your whole team 's fired ! '' He starts looking for Lily , Lupus , Gordo
MILES: But the best part was that he could n't find Gordo ! He was in the bathroom . So he finally goes in there , kicks in a stall door and starts yelling ! And there 's Gordo , pants at the ankles , holding a PC World Magazine ! More LAUGHS .
GORDO: I have n't been able to use a public athroom since .
LUPUS: Especially with the thing !
JAKE: Uh , right And that was it . That 's when we decided to start our own usiness . No more shithead bosses .
ASHSY: I envy you guys . Taking a chance like that .
GORDO: Masters of our own destiny .
LILY: So far , masters of our own demise . What bank are you with ?
ASHBY: City Bank of Manhattan .
GORDO: That 's that Gillette guy , right ? You Like him ? As a boss , I mean .
ASHBY: He 's . . . He 's okay .
GORDO: Come on
ASHBY: No . More LAUGHS .
JAKE: What do you do over at your bank , Grant ?
ASHBY: What do I do ? I 'm the VP of Finance . The group exchanges Looks .
MILES: Wow . We have n't met with anyone you level yet . VP ? So that means there 's you , then the P .
ASHBY: ( Confidently Yeah . That 's right .
RESUME ACTION: JAKE Maybe you can help us understand what 's so hard about getting a corporate loan .
ASHBY: Well , typically speaking , they 're not . As long as you can demonstrate
JAKE: A capacity for gross fund recovery . Yeah , we got that part .
ASHBY: That 's right . And tech firms They 'tend to scare people off .
JAKE: They scare people off because most people lack vision . Vision and balls . Present company excluded of course .
ASHBY: Banks need to know how they 're going to get their money back .
JAKE: We know exactly how we 're going to make The money back . There in lies the Catch-22
ASHBY: I do n't follow . An uncomfortable silence falls .
GORDO: Jake
LILY: It 's alright . Grant 's one of the good guys . She throws Ashby a flirty smile .
LUPUS: Yeah . He 's our boy .
JAKE: Listen , what I 'm about to tell you , I 'm telling you in confidence , okay ? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com ?
ASHBY: Big.Com . That Internet thing .
JAKE: Right . The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do . They get a good idea , shop it around , raise some capital , then sell it off to a bigger company . Microsoft , Intel , Oracle , whatever . The beauty of it is , they 've pretty much sold the company before they 're even real . The igger company is already set to buy it , all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works . So they get some start up capital , make it work , then sell it for like five times the initial loan .
ASHY: Sort of like a letter of intent .
JAKE: Exactly . But the Catch-22 is that you ca n't tell anyone about the offer , ecause if it 's public , you could start a bidding war and that 's considered a each of etiquette . It could kill a deal . But , wait too long and you 're not considered hot anymore .
ASHBY: And you have this letter of intent ?
JAKE: Yes . That 's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little .
LILY: We 're getting down to the wire . Apparently another company has a similar product in R & D right now . If they beat us to it
JAKE: Off the record , I 'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it 'd help . Ashby considers for a moment .
ASHBY: Should we get another round ?
GORDO: Poor bastard never knew what hit him . Jesus , I almost felt sorry for the guy .
MILES: I got ta work off some of this adrenaline . I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn . Anybody want in ?
LILY: I ' m going home
GORDO: Let 's go , Jake ?
JAKE: Uh No thanks . I 'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dolla pay-off .
GORDO: You sure ?
JAKE: Lupus ! Lupus turns and Jake moves closer . JAKE When this is all over , you 're going to tell me who the King put on Al .
LUPUS: You going to have the time ?
JAKE: I'11 find the time .
LILY: Look at you You want to go .
JAKE: For what ? A couple hundred bucks ?
LILY: I think you 'd do it for free . You ' re almost drooling . You like the rush .
JAKE: It 's what I do . It 's my job .
LILY: Why ? Your mother not breast feed you or something ?
JAKE: Are you asking me if I have something to prove ?
LILY: Do you have something to prove ?
JAKE: Not in that repressed anger sort of way .
LILY: I 'm your basic underachiever . Ca n't stand working and porn does n't seem like a good option .
JAKE: Good quality porn has it 's place in the world .
LILY: Whatever . But you I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything . So why this ?
JAKE: I 'm good at it . Lying , cheating . Manipulating I 'm good at it .
LILY: It 's more than that .
JAKE: Intuition . It does n't make you Yoda . Like tonight . You killed that guy tonight . But I knew you would .
LILY: So that was my part ? Smile and shake my ass ?
JAKE: No . You have another part ? You 'll know what to do .
LILY: How do you know I will ?
JAKE: Intuition .
LILY: You have really soft hands . Like a aby 's .
JAKE: Do n't ruin this for me .
BUTCH: Is that what it was , Jake ? Was it love ?
JAKE: You know when the first con was eve played ? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden .
WHAT?: JAKE
LILY: Do you think we can do it ?
JAKE: Maybe . Even if we do n't , you 'll be alright . You 're not in the hole with the King .
LILY: Who says you have to know the King to e in a whole ? I actually did have a eal job once . When I was in high school , I worked as a candy striper .
JAKE: Sounds respectable .
LILY: Not the way I did it . I was loaded half the time . I do n't know how you could change bedpans sober .
JAKE: You want to talk about an old oyfriend right now ? Jake , kissing up the length of Lily 's neck .
LILY: He was n't my boyfriend . I had a oyfriend at the time What was his name ? Anyway , Glenn was like thirty . I was only fifteen . But he was a nice guy . Real sweet . Liked to talk . We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that .
JAKE: Yeah , the sensitive guy-thing neve worked for me .
LILY: We were friends . I trusted him . I should have known it was weird . But , then again I was weird .
JAKE: You guys got busted . This is a great neck . Jake still kissing
LILY: No , we never got busted . We were done with a shift one night , both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend , about how we were thinking about doing it , you know ? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him . What the hell was his name ?
JAKE: Glenn talked you out of it .
LILY: Sort of . I was telling him about this great love of my life who 's name I do n't emember , and I could see He was getting pissed . I thought it was just ecause he was worried about me , but
JAKE: He was looking out for you .
LILY: Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor , that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off . He said he was going to `` fuck some sense into me . '' Jake stops kissing Lily and looks up at her .
JAKE: Lily Jesus Christ
LILY: After Glenn was finished , he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home . The next day , I finished my shift and met him around back , like we always did . I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest . Three or four times . Jake slides off Lily .
JAKE: Did , uh Did you kill him ?
LILY: I do n't know . I packed up my shit and an away . To this So unlike you , I guess I do have something to prove , in a repressed anger sort of way . Jake considers for a second .
JAKE: No . You trusted him You were just getting square .
LILY: You know why I told you that , Jake ? Because I trust you too .
JAKE: Sorry , honey . But I figure if we ca n't all share at a time like this
BUTCH: You got some issues , huh ?
LILY: I can take care of myself .
BUTCH: Hurry up .
ASHBY: Everything looks in order .
JAKE: This has to happen fast .
ASHBY: I know . It wo n't go unnoticed .
JAKE: There 'll be red flags . Jake slides an envelope across the desk .
ASHBY: What 's this ?
JAKE: You need some convincing . Consider it a convincer .
ASHBY: Let 's just slow down for a second
JAKE: You 're worried about recouping the loan . I already told you .
ASHBY: No , I understand that . What I mean What I 'm trying to say I was actually wondering about Well , my cut .
JAKE: The standard ten .
ASHBY: Ten percent . Of how much ?
JAKE: Two million .
GORDO: We 're going to make it back , Grant . Three or four times over .
JAKE: And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow .
GORDO: You 'll be there ?
JAKE: Eight A.M. flight .
GORDO: Calls ?
JAKE: We 'll use the Euc .
ROTTOVICH: Hey Jake .
JAKE: That tip not work-out for you fellas ?
ROTTOVICH: Tip was fine , Jake . We were a little more curious about the Fed .
JAKE: Hey , listen If you guys do n't pay your taxes , that 's your business .
SOBOZINSKI: Back up .
LUPUS: You want I should hold him down ?
ROTTOVICH: Special Agent Gunther Moonan . Ring a ell ?
JAKE: Gunther ? I think I 'd remember a Gunther .
ROTTOVICH: Ring it for him , Sobo . Sobozinski punches Jake again .
JAKE: Oh yeah . Moonan . I remember now . Thanks .
ROTTOVICH: Well he 's in town and he sure as shit emembers you . What are we going to do about this Jake ? We ca n't afford to have a Fed onto us .
JAKE: Would n't dream of it .
ROTTOVICH: I do n't know what you 're into with the King Pin , but whatever it is we get a piece , understand ? We get a big piece . If we find out you 're keeping us out , I may suddenly develope a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself . Say something stupid if we got a deal , Jake .
JAKE: Something stupid .
ROTTOVICH: Good boy .
SOBOZINSKI: And do n't leave town ! I always wanted to say that
LILY: People do n't like you much , do they ?
MOONAN: Did he buy it ?
ROTTOVICH: I think so . What 'd he ever do to you anyway ?
MOONAN: Let 's just say he burned me once . Moonan calmly turns the page of the paper .
JAKE: We go way back
JAKE: And that 's how Special Agent Gunthe Moonan and I became friends . Lupus nods , satisfied .
GORDO: Moonan . Here . Shit
LILY: So what ? We just stay clear of him .
JAKE: No , I 'm not going to take it easy . You ca n't stay clear of this guy . He will e on this until the end of time .
MILES: What do we do ? We change the scam ?
JAKE: There is no scam ! I 've got a fucking sign on my back ! I ca n't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money . You get it ? It 's over . We walk .
GORDO: Jake
JAKE: What do I always tell you guys ? Do n't spend it all . Sooner or later we 're going to run into some bad luck . Save some . Put it away , so when shit like this happens , you 're not desperate . That 's it . The gig 's up .
LILY: That 's it ? What are you talking about ? We can still do this !
GORDO: Jake , I mean , come on
JAKE: No , no , no ! Not this time . I am doing this for your own good ! You guys have got to learn when to stop . You with the Armani ! You with the hookers !
MILES: Escorts !
JAKE: Do you even remember Al ? Do you remembe what he looked like sitting there ?
LILY: You are such a raving pussy sometimes .
JAKE: Hey , we fucked once , honey . That hardly makes you a good judge of character . And do n't think I did n't know you were working some angle with that either .
LILY: Everyone 's working an angle , right ?
JAKE: There are three people I trust him , him and a guy who got killed . I do n't know who you are ! You 're like some stray doq that wandered into the house . So I 'm telling you to cut loose of this . No one 's looking for you , Not the King , not Moonan and not Gillette . Just go wherever it is you would go . It 's over .
LILY: What about
JAKE: What about what ?
LILY: What about the money ? Jake stops and levels a look at Lily .
JAKE: So there it is . You got that big itch you need to scratch . It 's all about the fucking money . What do you want , an apology ?
LILY: No , I want my cut !
JAKE: I 'm going to say this one last time fo You , so take a deep breath and count to ten . There is no cut . Lily levels a look of utter contempt at Jake .
LILY: You 're an asshole . With that , she grabs her coat and leaves . Lupus sits quietly , taking it all in .
GORDO: So that 's it
JAKE: That 's it .
LUPUS: King ai n't gon na like this .
JAKE: Do n't worry , I 'll settle up with you oss . We have n't skipped town yet .
LUPUS: What I 'm saying is , is that the King ai n't gon na care . See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy , If you ask me I think he 's jealous .
JAKE: Of what ? They 're both crooks .
LUPUS: Exactly . ` Cept this Gillette guy . He gets to walk around in three piece suits , hob knob with the Mayor , own a ank , that kinda shit . Meanwhile , the King sits holed up in the steam , afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door .
JAKE: My fucking heart bleeds .
LUPUS: Your buddy . That fat guy . The King could n't wait to have that guy whacked . He did n't even know who the guy was , but he was so pissed off at him , he gets him drilled . It ai n't personal . It 's business .
JAKE: Point , Lupus . Give us a point .
LUPUS: Point is , you do n't go through with this , he 's going to go after you next . And he do n't even like you , Jake . Lupus stares blankly at Jake .
BUTCH: So much for honor among thieves . You would have cut loose your friends , you girl
JAKE: I was doing it for them .
BUTCH: BULLSHIT ! You were scared , Jake ! You - Lost your nerve ! You lost you confidence ! You were n't being noble . You were n't trying to save anybody but yourself ! Admit it .
JAKE: It 's not true .
BUTCH: Yes it is Jake ! Yes it is ! They were ight there for you . She was right there for you ! Look at her !
LUPUS: Hey , boss . It 's me . The bank 's in . It 's happening tomorrow Jake ?
KING PIN: A Fed ? Is he close ?
LUPUS: But this girl , the redhead . She knows a lot . She could be a pain in the ass . Jake looks up .
JAKE: No . She wo n't . She 's not going to be a problem . Lupus cups the phone .
LUPU: He wants to talk to you . Do n't tell him I said he was jealous of Gillette , okay ? Jake reaches over and grabs the phone .
JAKE: Uh huh Uh huh Okay I understand . Jake hangs up the phone .
LUPUS: What 'd he say ?
JAKE: Oh , you know Do n't fuck this up . I 'll kill you . I 'll kill your family . I 'll shoot your dog All the usual . Then he said good luck .

ROTTOVICH: I do n't trust anybody . You see how bad this guy wants Vig ? It 's like a sickness . I say we collar Vig ourselves . We got Vig , then we got leverage . And we trade ; Vig for that tape . I want to see it right in front of my face .
SOBOZINSKI: It 's just insurance .
ROTTOVICH: That 's what I 'm talking about .
SOBOZINSKI: I 'm down ! Sobozinski holds his hand up for a high five .
ROTTOVICH: What are you doing ?
SOBOZINSKI: High five .
ROTTOVICH: Put your hand down . I do n't high five . There 's the CRACKLE from a walkie-talkie .
MOONAN: You guys awake ?
ROTTOVICH: We 're here .
MOONAN: Stay sharp . Moonan keeps his eyes on the Customs desk .
MR. HEAVYSET: Oh jeez . Mr. Heavyset quickly gets up .
JAKE: Gordo .
GORDO: I 'm landing in about fifteen minutes .
MR. HEAVYSET: Jeez I tell ya , this airline food goes right through me every time . Mrs. Heavyset pats her husband 's hand .
GORDO: You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy ?
GORDO: Let me just say that there is no way I 'm using the bathroom on this plane .
JAKE: He 's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the athroom . You believe this ?
LUPUS: Maybe he 's got it right . Maybe we 're all just looking for a safe place to shit .
JAKE: That was fucking deep .
KING PIN: Speak .
KING PIN: Good . Good . Do not let Vig out of your sight .
JAKE: What 's up with you ? Bladder infection ?
LUPUS: Keep it up .
JAKE: It 's me . It 's Jake . Listen It 's happening . Gordo 's landing right now . Meet me at the Euclid For your cut , I mean . It 's I want you to have it . Jake hangs up the phone .
LUPUS: You really like that bitch do n't you ? I got ta tell you , I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut . You know how it is , get her to do some shit for you , throw her a bang to keep her happy . But , if you 're into her That 's cool .
JAKE: That 's what I like about you , Lupus . You 're a free thinker . Do n't let the King tell you different .
LIONEL: Not for nothing , Jake , but the guy who whacked your buddy ? It was me . The King usually farms out for that kind of stuff , but I tell ya , he was so pissed off he could n't wait for the regula guy . Fucker did n't even put down his Kung Pao Chicken .
JAKE: Egg Foo Young . Stand up .
LUPUS: What ?
JAKE: Stand up .
LUPUS: No offense , but I 've seen you fight . You got ta be kidding m-
JAKE: I said stand up .
GILLETTE: Wow . Now that 's an exciting story . Butch , has anyone ever tried something like this before ?
BUTCH: Not that I recall . What do you want us to do about it ?
GILLETTE: Let 's see Let 's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught . We get ou money back , but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation . I do n't much like that idea . Then again , let 's suppose he actually gets through Customs . Now , that 'll be something . We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud . We double our money .
BUTCH: So we go to the bar .
GILLETTE: I think so . The airport 's going to be crawling with police . Traffic will be a nightmare . Go down to the bar . If they pull it off , great . Have someone deal with Ashby .
BUTCH: We 'll take care of it .
GILLETTE: And how much did you say you wanted fo this What did you call it ? A finder 's fee ?
LIL: Ten percent .
GILLETTE: Ten ? That seems a little high .
BUTCH: Ten is standard , sir .
GILLETTE: Fine . But only if we recover the cash .
LILY: Only if ? No way . I want something for this .
GILLETTE: Have a little faith in him , honey . Butch , see if you can get him to tell you how he did it . Or almost did it . Sounds like a good story .
BUTCH: I ' ll ask .
GILLETTE: Apple ?
MOONAN: I got him .
SOBOZINSK: Roger that .
ROTTOVICH: Oh yeah , we 'll wait , jerk-off .
MOONAN: He just went into the crapper . Hold your positions .
MOONAN: Hello ? Can you hear me ?
ROTTOVICH: Hey asshole . They both grin like idiots .
JAKE: Eww-Whoa ?
MILES: Jake ! I do n't know what 's going on ! The King Pin He 's here and he just got pinched . I think with the twinkies ! It looks like half the police department 's down here !

LILY: Can we please all stop being so goddamnfucking-polite and get to the point ?
BUTCH: Right . Where 's the money , Jake ?
JAKE: What do you get , Lily ? Finder 's Fee ? Because it is all about the money , ight ?
LILY: You sold me out . You should have trusted me like I trusted you . You fucked up . You fucked up HUGE . Butch taps Jake on the head with the gun .
BUTCH: Alright Turn around . She does n't get shit , unless I get that money . Where is it ?
JAKE: Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government . Butch buttons his coat .
BUTCH: Oh , Jake . You disappoint me . And you just let Lily here down again .
JAKE: It 's like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part except fo the mark .
BUTCH: Like putting on a play Guess some people forgot their lines .
JAKE: Guess so .
BUTCH: So why do n't you take a deep breath , Jake , and I 'll count to ten . One . Two . Three
JAKE: I do trust you , Lily .
BUTCH: Wha- Butch spins and aims at her . Lily pulls out a gun and BLAM ! ! !
BUTCH: Jesus Christ ! Tell me before you do something like that !
JAKE: Just watch everything you say around him . Every word , every move It all goes back to the King Pin . Get it ?
LILY: No , I want my cut ! Lupus watches quietly , taking it all in
LUPUS: You were right . He 's trying to fuck you . You want it , you got ta get it at the airport
ROTTOVICH: We 're on the job ! We 're active in the one-six .
IA OFFICER#1: Officers Rottovich and Sobozinski ?
SOBOZINSKI: Fuck me
JAKE: That 's how Special Agent Gunther Moonan and I became friends .
JAKE: Drop something ?
LILY: Oops . She smiles that smile .
DEALER: Insurance ?
BERNIE: Forget it .
NATALIE: Shit . Dewars and a Diet Coke . Please .
BERNIE: Hi , Natalie .
NATALIE: Hi . Uh
BERNIE: Bernie .
NATALIE: Yeah , Bernie . Hey , you seen Shelly around ? He promised to position me at the tables tonight . I 've been on skid row all week .
DORIS: You did n't settle me from last night .
NATALIE: No ? You sure ? Fuck And I was way under . It 's been , like , an A.A. convention the whole week . I 'll make up for it tonight . Promise .
BERNIE: If I see Shelly , I 'll let him know . That you 're looking for him .
NATALIE: Thanks . She takes off .
DORIS: Bitch . That 's the third time this month Let me get you that cream .
BERNIE: Nah , it 's okay .
DORIS: Do n't get sweet on that , Bernie . Not unless you 're looking to get short- changed .
FLOORMAN: Hey , Bernie , Shelly needs you on eleven .
BERNIE: Uh Let 's do the Chivas Regal . Have that Natalie bring it over . The one working nickel slots next to the Paradise . I spoke to Shelly earlier , he wants her at the tables .
NATALIE: This is you , right ?
BERNIE: Thanks .
NATALIE: Joe said I should stick around . You say something to Shelly ? Bernie just smiles at her .
BERNIE: Do n't mention it .
BULLDOG: I 'll make you a fortune on five and nine . C'mon forty-five-sixty-three fifty-four !
BERNIE: Hey , buddy , is this your drink ?
BULLDOG: Back off , pal . I 'm on a roll here .
STICKMAN: Seven out !
BULLDOG: Mother-fucker !
STICKMAN: Thank you for those bets , folks .
BERNIE: Yeah , yeah , I 'm comin '
SHELLY: Nicky , how the hell are you ? I did n't know you were coming in
NICKY: Whassimater ? You think I do n't wash up after goin ' to the John ? Forget about it . Nicky grabs Shelly , embraces him .
SHELLY: You shoulda called ahead . I woulda sent a car
NICKY: Ehh . We thought we 'd surprise you .
SHELLY: Well , anytime , Nicky . Anytime . Shelly sizes up the corporate types .
NICKY: Shelly , I want you to meet one of our smartest VPs , Larry Sokolov . And his numbers guy , Marty Goldfarb .
LARRY: How do you do , Shelly ?
SHELLY: What can I get you boys to drink ? Off their uncomfortable expressions
NICKY: Look , Shelly , this is your joint , you run it the way you see fit . But we got a smart kid here and he 's got some good ideas on how to revitalize the Shangri-la .
SHELLY: Revitalize ? What are you talking about ? We did thirty-five million last year .
LARRY: First off , Shelly , I want you to know , I have nothing but respect fo you . You 've done a fantastic jo with the Shangri-la for the last sixteen years . No one would dispute that .
NICKY: Yeah , no one doubts that , Shelly . Shelly nods carefully . But
LARRY: But , the business has changed out here . You just have to take a look at the Strip to see what I 'm talking about .
SHELLY: You mean , that amusement park mook fest out there ? You know what that is ? That 's a fucking violation of something that used to be beautiful . That used to have class . Like a gorgeous high priced hooker with an exclusive clientele . And then that Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up and puts her in a family way .
LARRY: Yes , well there 's no denying the ottom line . Those eyesores are raking it in . And we ca n't compete against that .
SHELLY: What ? You think I 'm trying to compete with that ? You think this joint 's about bringing in the stroller crowd ? Fresh off some fucking E-ticket ride , looking to break the house on red and black . Fremont 's never been about that bullshit . This is where old time and real money comes to play .
LARRY: The numbers , they do n't back you up , Shelly . Nostalgia 's grand . We all love nostalgia but it belongs in a museum . I think it 's time to decide whether you 're running a museum or a casino .
NICKY: Hey , forget about it . We 'll talk later . Over dinner .
MARTY: So , how 's the action ?
SHELLY: Bernie . Mr . Cool . Got a moment ?
BERNIE: I was just heading over to
SHELLY: It can wait .
BERNIE: I told you , I 'm not gon na be around after Sunday .
SHELLY: Where you gon na go , Bernie ? Where the fuck are you gon na go that 's etter ' n here ? I got you covered in this town . People , they know you work for me , that 's currency in you pocket . That 's fuckin ' respect when you walk the floor . Where you gon na get that anyplace else ?
BERNIE: Seven days , Shelly . Seven days and I 'm out from under .
SHELLY: That 's right . I like to know who 's shopping it in my neighborhood . You wan na keep working the Shangri-la , you come see me tomorrow morning in my office . We 'll go over the rules together . And before you come , you ing me a clean bill of health . OK ? The hooker just nods .
BERNIE: Things are getting hot on fourteen . I got ta go .
NATALIE: Seven and Seven ?
PINKERTON: Thanks , dollface .
NATALIE: Oh shit Sorry I 'm such a klutz .
BERNIE: It 's all right . Happens . Natalie tries to wipe him down a bit more .
NATALIE: Sorry , this guy fuckin ' hands , you know
BERNIE: S'okay . You might want to stick around .
STICKMAN: Excuse me , Mr. Pinkerton . You have no hard eight .
PINKERTON: Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight .
STICKMAN: Eight the hard way !
PINKERTON: Parlay ! Parlay !
BERNIE: Dollar hard eight .
STICKMAN: Eight easy ! Easy eight ! Hard eight comes down .
PINKERTON: Five hundred dollar hard eight . And press my nine up two units .
STICKMAN: Easy way eight ! Eight easy !
PINKERTON: Hard eight . The entire table stops down for a second .
STICKMAN: Seven out !
PINKERTON: What the fuck you smiling at , bitch ?
BUDDY: Shelly . I was a goddamn embarrassment tonight . I shouldn ' a let you talk me into going on . It 's definitely strep .
SHELLY: You were velvet out there , pops . Silk .
BUDDY: You get a receipt ?
SHELLY: Excuse me ?
BUDDY: Charmayne 's in the lobby . They got these on sale in the window . Victoria Secret 's Valentine 's Collection . And the broad waiting in the room , what she set you back ? Always Grade-A fo Ol ' Buddy .
SHELLY: Are you kidding me ? Gim me that . You do n't fucking deserve this . All those ladies going home with a sweet eeze between their legs because you still do it for them and you 're fingering me for some kinda Buddy Stafford ego pimp . Hey , fuck you , old man . Shelly feigns as if he 's leaving .
BUDDY: Get back here , you prick . Hand it over .
BUDDY: I 've seen this one a dozen times . It 's about lions . Cycle of life thing . The leader of the pack
SHELLY: Pride . It 's called a pride .
BUDDY: Yeah , pride . The leader of the pride when he gets on in years . It 's just a matter of time before some young male arrives on the scene to challenge him . They go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him . It 's humiliating . In front of all the females , this goes down . And after he 's defeated , he 's cast out of the pride , to scavenge and die alone in the bush .
SHELLY: Yeah , nature 's got a real sick sense of humor .
BUDDY: No shit . It 's fucking tragic because the old lion ca n't figure it out on his own . That he 's past it . It 'd be so much easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and humiliation .
SHELLY: That 's like admitting to yourself that you 're already dead . I prefe nature 's way .
BUDDY: Yeah . Me , too . Shelly holds Buddy 's gaze in the mirror .
LARRY: Shelly , got a minute
JOHNNY: How ya doin ' , Shelly ?
SHELLY: I know you from somewhere , right ?
LARRY: Johnny 's been opening for Danny Ganz at the Mirage . Sony 's talking about signing him to a three album deal . They 're positioning him as the new Ricki Martin .
SHELLY: And I should be interested in this , why ?
LARRY: Johnny 's looking to headline . I told him we might be interested .
SHELLY: We ?
JOHNNY: Hey , if this is a bad time
SHELLY: Even if I were interested , Buddy 's got ink with us through 2003 . I just enegotiated his contract last year .
JOHNNY: Sounds like the two of you need to get on the same page . If I do n't hear from you by Thursday , I 'm taking the Stardust 's offer .
NICKY: Where 's Buddy ? I wan na buy the old fart a drink .
SHELLY: Buddy asked me to send you his egards , Nicky . He 's not feeling so great . I think he 's got that stomach flu that 's going around .
NICKY: Oh yeah ? That 's too bad . Well , another time then .
MARTY: Hey , Shelly , Nicky says you might be able to hook us up with some showgirls . Something with class .
SHELLY: Sure , no problem . You got any preferences ?
NICKY: Yeah . Something with big headlights , nice rims and low mileage .
MARTY: You got any Asian babes ? Shelly looks to Larry .
LARRY: I think I 'll just stick with the tables .
NATALIE: Buy you a drink ? Off of Bernie 's surprised expression
BERNIE: No I just know what the outcome 's going to be .
NATALIE: The outcome ? There 's not , like , one particular outcome . A lot of things enter into it . The planets , moon phases
BERNIE: The outcome wo n't change with me . It 'll be all bad .
NATALIE: God , I have never met anyone who was so down on themselves . I used to be down on myself , OK ? I do n't go there anymore . I 've got just three more correspondence classes with this stuff , then I 'll have my certificate and everything . And you know how I got OK ?
BERNIE: You had your chart done .
NATALIE: Yes , as a matter of fact that is perfectly correct .
BERNIE: Do you know what I do at the Shangri- la ?
NATALIE: I asked around . You 're a `` cooler . '' You turn winners into losers .
BERNIE: And do you know how I do that ?
NATALIE: I know there 's stuff that goes on in casinos all the time
BERNIE: I do it by being myself . People get next to me and their luck turns . It 's always been that way .
NATALIE: That sounds to me like a self fulfilling prophecy . There 's a whole chapter on that in my course . Anyways , I can see a big factor in your life is that you 're lacking companionship . There 's nobody to deflect off . If you 've got , as you put it , bad karma , then you need someone with good karma to neutralize it . Well , that 's my take on it anyway .
BERNIE: I do n't know about you , but I 'm real tired .
NATALIE: I have this recurring dream where I 'm on some beautiful island in the Bahamas . I 'm sitting on the beach , taking in this amazing sunset with one of these in my hand and then it starts to rain . And I wake up and it 's my roof leaking on me . Yeah , I 'm also real tired , Bernie .
BERNIE: I only got six more days . Well , almost five really . Then I 'll be leaving town .
NATALIE: Only five more days ? Then we should n't waste any more time . Natalie covers Bernie 's hand with hers .
BERNIE: I , uh If this is I do n't know I do n't know if I can afford
NATALIE: Ah , just shut up , Bernie . You have n't gone and cooled anything . Not by a long shot .
BERNIE: I 'm not here that much . Drink ? Sorry , all I got 's gin .
NATALIE: Nah . I 've had my fill . Go ahead .
BERNIE: This is not my first
NATALIE: Sssh . Surprise me .
BERNIE: Sorry Natalie wraps her arms around him .
NATALIE: Do n't worry , Bernie . I 've had worse . We 'll try again later .
BERNIE: After I get out , I call up Shelly and he tells me to come out here . I figure he 's going to set me up good at the Shangri-la . But he tells me they got all these rules about casinos employing felons . So he gets me this gig doing telemarketing for one of their fronts trying to scam pensioners out of their retirement money . I lasted two weeks .
NATALIE: He did that to you ? What , he shot you ?
BERNIE: Baseball bat . I got off easy .
NATALIE: That 's getting off easy ?
BERNIE: I was out of control .
NATALIE: But he maimed you
BERNIE: Let me tell you something . I 'm grateful for what he did . No kidding . Every time I get an urge to play off the clock to so much as drop a quarter in a slot I each down and squeeze what 's left of my cartilage . It 's one helluva eminder .
NATALIE: Jesus I thought stuff like that did n't happen no more . Like that was just in the movies or something . Bernie holds her gaze her for a moment .
BERNIE: Anyway , Shelly and I worked out a payment plan . Two years off the books at the Shangri-la , cooling tables . Five more days and I walk .
PREGNANT GIRL: Oh shit , I think I 'm going into labor !
BERNIE: Mikey ?
MIKEY: Bernie
PREGNANT GIRL: I 'm OK now . False alarm . Thanks . Bernie pulls Mikey aside .
BERNIE: Mikey ? Is that ? You 're not the
MIKEY: Bull 's eye . One time . Obviously runs in the family . I guess you 're gon na e a grandfather , Bernie .
BERNIE: This you ?
MIKEY: Hey , what the fuck , it runs . Anyways , we got ta be somewhere
BERNIE: How 's your mom doing ?
MIKEY: I 'm gon na pretend like you give a shit and tell you , she 's getting by . As long as she 's wasted . Bernie nods . He gazes past Mikey to the girl .
NATALIE: When was the last time you saw a doctor ? Charlene sidles up alongside Mikey .
CHARLENE: This clinic in Jersey . Maybe six months ago . I was n't about to go ack after they treated me like cattle . Just because I did n't have no insurance . And those places , they 're crawling with T.B . from all 'em spies .
BERNIE: So , you 're in town ?
MIKEY: Maybe a week or so . Got some business to take care of .
BERNIE: If you want , stop by the Lucky Sta Motel . Give us a chance to catch up . I 'm on three to eleven shift at the Shangri-la . I work the floor .
MIKEY: No shit . Well , how 'bout that ? Yeah , maybe I 'll do that . We can play catch up . For the kid 's sake . Got ta split .
NATALIE: Take care .
PLAYER: Thanks
BERNIE: Do n't mention it . Bernie sits at the table .
DEALER: Hundred dollar minimum here , sir .
PLAYER: No offense , pal , but there 's twenty other tables . What do you wan na come sit on my head for ?
BERNIE: Just wan na play one hand . Feeling lucky tonight . I got this voice in my head , says this is the table
PLAYER: I know this is the table . I 'm already doing good here . It 's my fucking table
BERNIE: Hey , heard the one about the fella walks into a bar and says , `` Hey , who owns that big great dane outside ? '' A man at the end of the bar raises his hand . `` I do . '' The fella says , `` Yeah ? Well , my dog just killed it . ''
DEALER: Insurance ? We see the dealer 's got an ace showing .
PLAYER: God damnit !
BERNIE: Keep going .
PLAYER: Hey , stick around , pal . You and me , we make a great team .
SHELLY: What was that ? Bernie shrugs , still confused .
LARRY: Is there a problem ?
SHELLY: No , there 's no problem . Fella 's on a streak , is all .
LARRY: Let me guess ? This is one of you `` coolers ? ''
SHELLY: Why do n't you announce it to the whole fucking joint ?
LARRY: Man , they told me you were a stickle for the old ways . But coolers ? What is this guy , some kind of degenerate gambler ? Reformed card shark ? He does n't look too effective to me .
SHELLY: He 's the best . Take it from me .
LARRY: Sure . Whatever . But there ways subtle ways to keep things in ou favor . I 'm talking more forward thinking methods .
SHELLY: That right ? I suppose you got a whole fucking prospectus on the subject .
LARRY: As a matter of fact I do . Like , right off the bat , I can tell you this wallpaper is n't going to cut it . It 's too uplifting . I would go with more muted tones .
SHELLY: Yeah ? Wallpaper ?
LARRY: And personally , I think the waitresses can all pop another button or two . Myself , I would n't hire anything less than a C cup .
MORRIE: Shelly , you better come quick .
SHELLY: Get a hold of his daughter . Assist her with the arrangements . The Shangri- la will take care of everything .
MORRIE: What about the Paradise ?
SHELLY: She goes dark tonight .
LARRY: That wo n't be necessary .
NATALIE: What ?
BERNIE: Nothing .
NATALIE: What ?
BERNIE: Nothing . You 're just an easy mark , is all .
NATALIE: An easy mark ?
BERNIE: Yeah . Easy mark . You never heard that term ? Natalie shakes her head .
NATALIE: You notice last night , that tattoo on my butt ?
BERNIE: Little Joe .
NATALIE: Yeah , two twos . Little Joe .
BERNIE: You know , you do n't have to tell me this .
NATALIE: I want to , Bernie . Better you know the worst of me up front . Later , when I 'm already invested in you , it 'll be too hard to come clean . After I tell you this , you 'll probably I mean , I 'll understand .
BERNIE: So , you wan na go try your hand at the dime pitch ? It 's early still .
CHARLENE: I got ta go pee . I 'm always peeing . She closes the door after her .
NATALIE: How did you get in here ?
MIKEY: I told the desk clerk Bernie was my old man . He let us wait inside . That a problem ?
NATALIE: Bernie 's looking for a parking space .
MIKEY: Shit . I musta taken the last one .
NATALIE: Excuse me ?
MIKEY: My old man , is he renting your ass ? 'Cause otherwise I just do n't get it . A loser like my pops in the company of some primo T & A . It do n't compute .
BERNIE: Mikey
MIKEY: Hey , Bernie . I told you I was gon na stop by .
BERNIE: Yeah I figured you 'd call ahead . We were out at breakfast .
NATALIE: You missed some .
MIKEY: You see , the thing is , Bernie , we 're kinda strapped . I mean , Charly here 's expecting like yesterday , and we do n't have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her an ' all . So , I was wondering if you would care to invest a little in you grandchild 's future his well being .
BERNIE: There 's about three grand there . That 's all I got .
CHARLENE: Bless you , Bernie . You know , Michael , I think we should name her Bernadette . Afte your father .
MIKEY: You mean , Bernie . Trust me , it 's a oy . Bernie seems quite moved by it all .
CHARLENE: Wan na feel her ?
BERNIE: I do n't think I do n't want anything to hap
CHARLENE: Ooh , I just felt her kick . C'mon , Bernie , gim me your hand She places Bernie 's hand over her stomach .
BERNIE: I do n't know I think so Mikey takes Charlene by the arm
MIKEY: We 'll catch you later , Bernie . I think I 'm gon na take Charly over to the hospital right now . Get he checked up real good .
CHARLENE: Take care , Pop .
BERNIE: Mikey
NICKY: Shelly , I hope you do n't mind
SHELLY: What 's going on , Nicky ?
NICKY: I 'm sorry we did n't say nothing about this earlier but the deal was n't closed yet .
MARTY: Do n't worry , Shelly , you 're gon na love it .
NICKY: The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino . We break ground on her in six months . Off Shelly 's startled expression
LARRY: She 's perfect . Three floors of gaming , IMAX theater , entertainment center , outiques , restaurants , rollercoaster , you name it . She 'll pay for herself in three years , and then it 's easy money .
NICKY: Is n't she great , Shell ?
SHELLY: In `` Lost Horizon , '' these people , their plane crashes in the Himalayas and they get rescued and taken to this Utopia in the mountains . Shangri- la . It 's beautiful . The place is completely isolated . Untouched by the outside world . There 's no war , no greed , no bullshit Time is slowed down . People , they do n't age . It 's paradise . That 's what Shangri- la is . Paradise .
LARRY: Yeah , we 've all seen the movie . And your point is ? Shelly whirls around , yells
SHELLY: You do n't fuck with paradise ! All ' a ya !
NICKY: Hey , Jesus , c'mon , Shelly . We 're not trying to fuck with it . We 're trying to make it better .
SHELLY: How how , Nicky , could it be any etter ? Right now it 's perfect . It 's the last of its kind . It 's pure and this . this is just it 's a mockery . An insult . Trying to make something of it that it is n't .
LARRY: What are you talking about ? It 's ight outta the movie ?
SHELLY: Whose talking about a fuckin ' movie ? This ai n't a fuckin ' movie . This is my life . This is my house of worship . You people are shittin ' on all that 's sacred to me .
NICKY: You make some good points , Shelly . Maybe it 'll swing back the othe way , who knows ? But the smart money suggests we roll the dice . I 'm not gon na bullshit you ; naturally there 's gon na be a lot of restructuring in the months to come , but I want you to know , you 'll always have a place with us .
SHELLY: Where 's that ? Behind the bar ?
MARTY: Behind the bar , that 's a good one .
NICKY: I think you should take some time and think things through . All this , it 's a lot to digest , y'know .
MARTY: Speaking of things to digest , I 'm starving . How 's that buffet they got in the Valley of the Blue Moon ? You ecommend their prime rib , Shell ?
SHELLY: It 's food .
NICKY: Hey , my arteries can use a workout . Lead us to the trough , Shell .
MARTY: I thought we were gon na eat ?
SHELLY: Maybe we wan na play over there . Less crowded .
NICKY: Nah , let 's play here . This is my lucky table . I always play here . Go on ahead . I know where to find you guys .
STICKMAN: Out ! Seven , line away seven
SUBURBANITE: C '' mon , pops ! What the hell ? I coulda paid my mortgage with the money I just lost .
SHOOTER: Hey ? I 'm supposed to be next
NICKY: File a grievance , shithead .
STICKMAN: We 're coming out . Crap Eleven , any seven . Nicky throws in some chips to the center .
NICKY: Hundred dollar big red .
SUBURBANITE: Hurry it up , gramps . Your soup 's getting cold . Nicky throws .
STICKMAN: Crap , Ace Deuce . Line down . The croupiers takes down the pass line .
SUBURBANITE: Hey , Busketti , maybe you should try shuffleboard .
STICKMAN: Four , hard four . The point is four . The players make their bets .
SUBURBANITE: Good now throw it before you fucking keel over and die , old man . Nicky slowly starts his routine defiantly .

BERNIE: He ai n't never comin ' back .
SHELLY: That 's a dead man talking .
BERNIE: I 'm through with this joint , Shelly . Natalie and me , we just got married . We 're outta here . I 'll get a job out there in the world . Send you half my paycheck every month . Make good on my obligations .
SHELLY: You try to walk on me , Bernie , and I 'll fuckin ' bury you . The both of you .
BERNIE: I do n't think so . Shelly 's expression Oh yeah ?
SHELLY: What the fuck ? Me ? I 'm the loser ?
BERNIE: What you got ? What do you got in your life besides this joint ?
SHELLY: What the fuck more do I need ?
BERNIE: You got nothin ' , Shelly . This place your legacy it 's a mirage . You turn your back and it do n't even exist . There 's no day , there 's no night , it 's all just one big fuckin ' lur and it do n't count for nothin ' ! Shelly looks to Tony and Lou
SHELLY: You believe this fuckin ' guy ? Bernie gets eye-to-eye with Shelly . A first .
BERNIE: I feel real sorry for you . Yeah , you got this fear of germs thing . But it goes deeper than that . You ca n't get close to no one . On an emotional level . You 're the worst kind of gambler there ever was too scared to put his chips on the table . Too scared to open his heart to extend any real kinda friendship . Always afraid it 's gon na end out in the desert . Well , sweet fuckin ' dreams , pal , 'cause I 'm out and if that 's where it ends , that 's where it ends .
SHELLY: That 's a real heartfelt speech , Lootz . All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face intensity . You almost sold me . Man , I 've got a fucking lump in my throat . But it still do n't change things . You bail on me without making good on my 150 G 's and I 'm gon na be forced to close the books on you . You and the broad . You leave me no choice .
BERNIE: Change only
CROUPIER: Check change three thousand . The boxman counts the cash .

NICKY: The kid wants you should know , Shelly , he 's just protecting our investment the old school way . See you around .
BERNIE: He was drunk . It was just freak luck
NATALIE: Do n't give it a name , Bernie . It scares me . All I know is , you 're still running hot and that 's a good thing . But we 're only winners if we keep going . No looking back .
BERNIE: Lady luck , Natalie . I 'm calling it . Lady luck . And we got it as long as we 're together . They ca n't touch us now .

You investment in this casino will be well looked after . The future looks ight , gentlemen . Very , very bright .
HELEN: Our society creates these socially and psychically disenfranchised men , and their revenge on society is terrible . They are hard to catch . They are `` the nice guy next door , '' their employers if they work at all find them quiet and uncomplaining . Early abuse and ejection have taught them passivity . Only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive . What they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity . For these men , ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human eing . Torture , the pain they inflict , the screams of the victim , are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain . And then the depression , the forgetting , the feeling of sadness and despai egins the cycle all over again . Like addicts seeking their drug , Albert DeSalvo , Bianchi and Buono , Berkowitz , Dahmer , Bundy they seek out their next victim .
HELEN: Andy ! Andy !
CHESSMASTER: 'It 's almost seven . Make a goddam move . '
HELEN: ' I 'm a terrible date . I 'd mess up you life . '
CHESSMASTER: 'Another romantic dream gone all to hell . '
HELEN: 'Maybe it 's better to just dream on ; avoid the disappointments of life . Come on , move . '
COMPUTER: You Queen is in check . Protect your Queen .
RUBEN: Yeah , but she had divine guidance .
SUSAN: Inspector , can you
RUBEN: That 's her job Jesus , Quinn is here already .
QUINN: I been waiting I have to do everything myself . Photo , crime tech , the Coroner are already inside . The Landlady calls it in ; tenant is not answering when called , she sticks her head in , sees the body , uses the deceased 's telephone to call 911 . Otherwise nothing disturbed .

PHONE VOICE: Hello ! This is Geena Martinez , how are you this morning ?

PHOTOGRAPHER: Do n't tell your Grandmother how to suck eggs . I only been doing this work since your junior prom , darling But M.J. is already on to other things .
SUSAN: continues to stonewall the public . Now
QUINN: Shut up . He and M.J. both listen to SUSAN .
SUSAN: third Bay Area woman has been strangled , but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer . Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes , unless new evidence
QUINN: I tagged the goddamned stocking . It ai n't lost . We 're sequestering that evidence . That 's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into
NH: Then I decided what evidence we choose to sequester .
QUINN: Okay . What do you want to sequester ?
NIKKO: Harvey , I do n't want you in here no more , making false statements
CONFESSOR: They are not false . We pay fo city government like this , you do n't even care about the truth ? ! I killed her in the bathtub .
NIKKO: Why ?
CONFESSOR: Because she was dirty , a dirty girl !
NIKKO: How ? How did you do it , Harvey ?
HARVEY: With a knife ?
NIKKO: Good guess , but not good enough . Get the fuck outta here
RUBEN: It 's mostly done , they got nobody in common , the three of them No mutual friends the Landlady says nobody was ever there , she neve saw her with anybody .
PACHULSKI: Yes , ma'am , I know . You ca n't talk her right now because she 's usy , she 's all tied up . Deep Throat 's back . He hits the speaker phone
HELEN: Who is this ?
PACHULSKI: Ask her about the moon bike .
HELEN: What is wrong with you people ? The first two , I thought he might e on a lunar cycle because they were 28 days apart , but obviously not . This new one is only two weeks .
ANDY: Would you please get your hands off my face , Tallulah ? What happened to the newspaper ?
HELEN: I got it myself I could n't wait .
ANDY: Well ! Are n't we the daring one ? What 's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door ? The antenna is gone off her car again . I had no music , all the way to the market . Let me find a garage fo it ?
HELEN: I 've told you I ca n't afford to garage it .
ANDY: Are you kidding ? You buy enough gourmet junk every week most of which rots to garage a fleet of stretch limos .
HELEN: I had the dream again . And I got another call . This time he spoke . He said `` You and me , you and me . ''
ANDY: A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for . Forget it .
HELEN: He whispered , but it was him ! I know it was him ! Andy now stops to address this seriously
ANDY: He ca n't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you . Did you give him an approval ?
HELEN: Andy ? When a three-year-old says there 's a monster under the bed , you do n't say 'forget it ' . You look under the bad . I 'm three years old . Call the prison .
ANDY: When was the last time you washed your hair ?
HELEN: Monsieur Andy , disapproves of my coiffure ?
ANDY: Monsieur Andy can smell you coiffure . And guess what else ?
HELEN: Andy ?
ANDY: Here we go again .
HELEN: You parked right behind him . The one I noticed earlier . I did n't say anything , I thought he 'd leave . Just take a look .
ANDY: Oh my God ! Help ! HE 'S READING A
HELEN: But earlier , he was staring up here . Please , Andy .
ANDY: Okay . You win . 'Dirty Harry ' coming up . ANDY leaves the apartment .
RUBEN: None of your fucking business .
ANDY: Listen , asshole , I 've got a gun
RUBEN: I hate this
ANDY: Only kidding !
HELEN: I 'm calling the police !
ANDY: I 'm okay . I really kind of enjoyed it .
HELEN: Is he out ?
ANDY: Are you staying long ? Shall I shut the door ? Make your coffee ? Make the beds ?
HELEN: You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank ? Oh God , I am ! Make them some coffee . Halloran , is it ? Investigato Goetz ? I had a crank call myself he said I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum . I thought he might be out of prison .
RUBEN: Daryll Lee Cullum ? I do n't think so . If he 's escaped we 'd have the National Guard , cops 'd be crawling through sewers . You 'd have a guard on your front door .
HELEN: You do n't admire me . No police admire me . I got one of you killed . Why do n't you say right out what you 're here for ?
RUBEN: You called us , Doctor , if you do n't want to look at them here , how about downtown . I 'll drive you down
ANDY: Now look what you did .
RUBEN: What did I do ?
ANDY: You threatened to drive he downtown . She has agoraphobia .
RUBEN: Fear of what
ANDY: Open space . She has n't been out of this apartment in three years . I did n't used to think it was real He 's making her comfortable .
RUBEN: Classy madonna .
ANDY: Shit
ATTORNEY: it was your feeling afte careful evaluation that he was a sexual sadist who satisfied at least four out of ten criteria in the DMS III ?
HELEN: Yes . Without question .
ATTORNEY: Without question ? He only scored 40 percent , four out of ten criteria ? Could n't another expert say he flunked the sexual sadist test ? What curve are you marking on , Doctor ?
HELEN: The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects .
ATTORNEY: Only part . What else ? What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it .
HELEN: He was lying .
ATTORNEY: 'Lying . He was lying . ' I asked you what you thought , not what he did .
HELEN: I thought he was lying .
ATTORNEY: You said , first , he was lying . How do you know that , Doctor ?
HELEN: Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hea voices in both ears . Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear . Murmur of subdued laughter in court .
ATTORNEY: What pattern was that ?
HELEN: The same as the first time
ATTORNEY: The first what ? Your Honor , she 's got this far , I think she should finish . I do n't think this jury should be left wondering where the rest of he statement would lead .
JUDGE: I agree , Doctor .
HELEN: The first two murders .
ATTORNEY: What first two murders . We do n't know about them here , do we ?
HELEN: He told me he had done two others just like it .
ATTORNEY: When was that ?
HELEN: When he was seventeen .
ATTORNEY: And you believed him when he told you he had done that .
HELEN: Yes . I believed him .
QUINN: There was no sperm .
HELEN: Oh , God . I must have looked horrible .
ANDY: No , dear . You 're at your best with a bag in front of your face .
HELEN: I want to die .
ANDY: I would n't . He 'll be back . If you want him . The cute brutal type with handcuffs . Very sexy .
HELEN: Reminded me that I used to be attractive . That men used to want me
ANDY: You slut ! No sexy young cop fo you unless you shampoo your hair .
HELEN: About what ?
ANDY: Then , why do n't you just die . I 'm going . They 'll find your body years later , the old recluse lady , she ate cat food , ten years of the New York Times , unread , piled on top of the unread mail , the TV still on . Make up your mind . Live or die . I 'll get coffee .
NIKKO: Working late . You 're a damn fool .
RUBEN: What 's wrong with him ?
HELEN: Except for this one . You put that one in to test me . M.J. nods , pleased with HELEN
RUBEN: The Boston Strangler , when was that ?
HELEN: In the sixties . He 's dead stabbed to death in prison .
ANDY: It 's good medicine .
RUBEN: A little homeopathic cure for the willies .
HELEN: None of you know anything about it . Now go . And Andy , if you persist in playing doctor , leave , with them .
ANDY: I 'm the only friend you 've got , darling , and I do n't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us .
HELEN: Get out ! All of you !
RUBEN: You said you do n't give a fuck and that 's the beauty of a breakdown ? This does n't look like not giving a fuck , you know that ?
QUINN: Aw , Jesus . The Mouth gets a load of this and we got major headlines around the world . deSalvo redux . The matter , you think they do n't teach Latin in Catholic schools ?
RUBEN: What I love , the big fight , some girl , she drops the quarter on he oyfriend so the bastard spends the night in custody , just to teach him a lesson . We 'll get a shitload of those .
QUINN: Another country heard from . No . We 're keeping it quiet , do n't give the bastard the attention he 's maybe begging for .
ANDY: She 's in the office
HELEN: That 's the face of the next one he 'll kill .
RUBEN: He 's hacked into her Internet address . He 's a hacker .
HELEN: He can get into my computer any time he likes ! This is exactly the kind of thing I did n't want to have happen .
RUBEN: You got a tape backup , yeah , here lem me copy it on tape
HELEN: It 's a game they like to play . Berkowitz `` Son of Sam '' hung around the crime scene , talking to the cops . This one 's probably watching you , laughing at you .
RUBEN: Let me get a little action started here .
HELEN: One officer already got killed trying to protect me . Please , just take it all away . Leave me alone .
RUBEN: Look at this
HELEN: It 's gone . The file 's not here . What did you do ?
RUBEN: I just started it copying to tape , ut the tape never ran . It just did that
HELEN: He 's brilliant . This one is illiant .
QUINN: He 's on the phone calling me like an insurance salesman soliciting my usiness , for Christ 's sake . I did n't tell him the three most over-rated things in life are young pussy , regular exercise and the
HUSBAND: Stupid goddam s-stupid p-poke game ! Always have to s-stay until Phil makes a ccomeback . Am I stuttering ?
ANDY: She just got to sleep . Do you have to tell her about it now ?
HELEN: I am not going to look at any more pictures . They 're like a disease . They get into my head . I ca n't get them out .
RUBEN: Absolutely .
ANDY: The moon is up , my night to howl . Will you be okay ?
HELEN: Oh , God , I forget . Yes . Yes . You go . Poor thing , you ought to get out .
ANDY: Look out for her . She 's toughe than you think . He goes
HELEN: I know 'Halloran . ' What 's the rest of it ?
RUBEN: MaryJane . We call her M.J .
HELEN: MaryJane . You think that logic and police procedure , order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night . I did once . But you know how he 'll get caught ? He 'll have an accident , or some cop will get lucky . You ca n't catch him by being intelligent and working hard . Or the worst there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way , month afte month . The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows , and hurry home before dark . And then , one day , there are no more . What happened ? Did he just stop ? Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more ? Did he kill himself ? Did he die in an auto accident ? Or a fight . O get sick and die ? It 's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth . And you never know . But you keep asking yourself when you ead about a new murder is he ack ?
RUBEN: We 're through for the night , are n't we ? You go on . Get some sleep . I 'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a ca home .
HELEN: That would be much appreciated . Thanks .
RUBEN: You ought to get some decent locks on these . A six-year-old could get in here . Much less a motivated man .
HELEN: You and MaryJane are n't lovers .
RUBEN: Not yet .
HELEN: Are you always so bold ?
RUBEN: No . I 'm shy and I 'm selective . His grin says he 'd select her anytime
HELEN: Well . Another time , then . I 'll be all right . He 's not going to attack me ; what I ' m rally afraid of is all in my own head , Ruben .
RUBEN: They 'll have a guard here tomorrow . I know you have the idea , but it 'll make me feel a lot better .
HELEN: Oh , God ! Help me ! RUBEN reappears , races toward her
RUBEN: Tell me what to do !
HELEN: I 'm falling ! I 'm going to fall !
RUBEN: I 'm right here . I wo n't let you fall .
HELEN: Do n't let go I ca n't breathe I 'll die !
RUBEN: Shhh . It 's okay . Just breathe . I 'll fix it RUBEN takes out his gun
HELEN: The lock
RUBEN: I 'll get a locksmith .
HELEN: Will you stay ? Please ? I 'm afraid to sleep I do n't wanthimin my head
WOMAN: Put in the Kevin Costner .
PETER: Why do n't we save it for later ? It 's almost time for Letterman .
WOMAN: You know I do n't like to watch talk shows by myself . Where 're you ?
PETER: Yes , I fed her . If she says she 's hungry , she 's lying to you . Again .
WOMAN: She does n't lie ! You sure you fed her ?
PETER: She lies all the time . Why would I say I fed her if I did n't ?
WOMAN: That 's what I do n't know . Why would you lie ? That 's the problem I ca n't understand why anyone would lie .
PETER: Did n't I promise I 'd come right ack ?
RUBEN: Up all night with a sick friend . NIKKO 'S face is tight with anger .
NIKKO: You dumb son of a bitch ! You do n't even know how to treat a woman .
RUBEN: Who ? M.J. ? Hey , Nikko , explain to me why she gave you the boot
DOC: Not likely .
RUBEN: She did n't fight back , no hair o skin under her fingernails . I 'm not seeing any bruises o contusions
NIKKO: Probably so stoned she never knew what got her . Like Goetz 's sick friend . Right Goetz ? They ignore him . M.J. stands
RUBEN: She 's blue as hell . No marks on he neck . Asphyxiated ? not the same no ligature marks . Outdoors
DOC: After she was dead .
RUBEN: She was dragged up here from the oad , you can see the tracks . She was already dead or unconscious . Let 's get plaster casts on any all footprints .
NIKKO: Doped up kids all over town . Park was full of them last night . Very easy pickin ' . Goetz 's type .
RUBEN: You 're right . I ca n't stand that astard . Sorry . This is something new . Not the same guy , that 's for sure .
SUSAN: What 's this about the Boston Strangler , M.J. ?
RUBEN: Excuse me ? Excuse me ? ! What do you
QUINN: I know ; the kid hit you first . He already told me .
NIKKO: He 's not treating her right
QUINN: She left you , Nikko . She 's not your responsibility . She takes very good care of herself . If she wants to romance the kid , it ai n't your business . Your business is to snap out of it .
NIKKO: We were together six years , sir !
QUINN: Do n't give me six years ! You neve divorced Patty , did you ? So what 'd you expect from M.J. ?
NIKKO: She knows I 'm Catholic ! She neve mentioned divorce ! Not once !
QUINN: Then you shoulda known she was n't uying . She was just long-term leasing ' you . Ah , Nickie . Except for that rare twenty-second twitch , there ai n't nothin ' about sex I do n't hate . But of course , I 'm Irish . Plus I got real problems . I 'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J . There 's something going on here , the Commissioner is targeting her now , I ca n't leave a woman in that position . But the thing is , how can I move you in , if you go on acting like a teenage asshole ?
NIKKO: I do n't want the job . Do n't do that to her . She 's worked too damned hard for it .
QUINN: What 's going down with the sting in Chinatown ? That gon na be off you plate in a week or what ?
HELEN: I 'm not seeing anybody .
ANDY: I know . Do come and meet you guest .
HELEN: That 's no surprise .
ANDY: She 's smoking again .
HELEN: Hello ? Oh yes , she 's right here .
HELEN: He 's switched from DeSalvo to the Hillside Strangler . The Strangle was two men , that 's why there are two kinds of sperm . His idea of a joke , very witty our boy .
SUSAN: to mimic the M.O . of the Boston Strangler . The police here are umored to be consulting Dr. Helen Hudson .
HELEN: You betrayed me ! Now every psychopath in the city knows I 'm ack in business You lied to me !
TECH GUY: Pulled this out of the door , it 's igger than a .38 ; it 's a .44 or 9 millimeter .
RUBEN: Yeah ? I ca n't talk now What ? No . There 's no sexual assault , it 's a drive-by , a woman in a car , it 's not him . u > Helen .

CONRAD: I brought a present for the lady , there . I 'm looking for her , to give her the present
RUBEN: You break into her apartment to deliver a gift ? Where is it ?
CONRAD: The door was open , swear to God , I 'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs
RUBEN: Where is it ?
CONRAD: I 'm trying to tell you . It 's on the lady 's pillow Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop 's hands .
RUBEN: He told you she was loaded , any- thing you could steal you could keep , Conrad ? You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin , eaking and entering .
CONRAD: The door was already open
RUBEN: We know Send the book to evidence
CONRAD: She 's supposed to have it .
RUBEN: She do n't want it .
HELEN: Why do n't you shoot off the lock ?

HELEN: They taught me at the FBI . I was very good at it . It scared me I liked it .
RUBEN: You take it , hang on to it , it 'll make you feel safer . Stay put .
HELEN: What else ? He goes .
SAKS: Hello . I am Meryhew Saks . The song is called `` Murder By Numbers . '' The performers are a group called The Police . Adam here from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note . This is an extremely complex case , and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around . We 're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers . We have Quantico working on graphology , the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor . It 's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims . We have a team sweeping sperm banks . Now I want to say a few word to you local people . Your Commissioner asked for our assistance . The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police . We could n't catch up on what you people know if we had a year . We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science ; you have the local savvy . Togethe we can be unbeatable . Which one is Inspector Halloran ?
QUINN: Sorry to interrupt . I need a word with my officer
GIGI: Lab called . They got a result on the drug test you requested ? It takes a moment to remember what it was
HELEN: `` I 'll be back ''
FELIX: We keep records of any threatening or illegal correspondence , like elatives of victims who might want to send the condemned man some strychnine cookies . So it 's only a partial list , but you 're still looking at about forty pages
GIGI: Hot off the fax . Mr. Rivkind 's fans .
ANDY: It 's almost six . And guess what ? Hall likes me bathed and shaved .
HELEN: Stop acting like a silly little fag !
ANDY: My life to live , darling , try to emember what it was like way , way ack when you were young and sexy and alive . He gets up and walks toward the door .
HELEN: You bastard !
ANDY: But alive !
HELEN: Let 's speed up the game plan call all the living serials to ask if they 've had contact with a Pete Kurten . We could use some help on the phones
MITCHELL: Sergeant Halloran is it ? I 've got a list of Daryll Lee 's correspondents . There is a Peter Kurten among them . Daryll Lee claims he has information about Kurten , but he 'll only talk to Dr. Hudson personally . Nobody else . The creep 's been studying his amendments . My guess is he does n't have zip . Just angling for a chance to ask if her bra size is still the same . We get this shit all the time , but it 's her call .
HELEN: Not a damn bit
DARYLL LEE: Hey , Doc ! How you doing ? She turns on speakerphone .
HELEN: Hello , Daryll Lee .
DARYLL: You read my book which as you know , hit the stands a couple of weeks ago . You read it yet .
HELEN: What book ?
DARYLL: I sent it by private courier , he did n't give it to you ? That son of a gun !
HELEN: I 'll look for it , Daryll Lee .
DARYLL: Bet you never figured I 'd follow in your footsteps . It 's real well- written . You should read it you 're in it .
HELEN: I will . I 'll call you , Daryll , and talk to you about it after I 've ead it . Right now I have a question Peter Kurten .
DARYLL: Kurten ! Is he bothering you ? I told that son I 'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone .
HELEN: Ah ha . What did he want ?
DARYLL: Something personal . Is he bothering you ?
HELEN: I do n't know . I 'd like to know where he is .
DARYLL: Listen , you want my advice ? Stee clear . He 's writing me he 's gon na finish 'my unfinished symphony . ' He 's gon na give me $ 550 for some of my cum , he says he 's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk . I 'm offended . Right away I smell u > freak . Writin ' about him and me and you bein ' joined and he 's gon na finish my symphony ? I did n't care for his drift . I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways . You hear I found Jesus ? And what 's funny is , now I do n't mind ein ' inside . If I was out , even Born Again , I 'd probably get estless again . It 's maybe bette I stay here , what do you think ?
HELEN: I think whatever is best for you , Daryll . And maybe you 're right , that 's the place .
DARYLL: You come and visit .
HELEN: Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten ?
DARYLL: Damn ! I gave that to Conrad , too ! That guy ! I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in eturn for getting my book to you .
HELEN: How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten ?
DARYLL: Conrad has the phone number . Conrad , where is he ?
HELEN: In jail .
DARYLL: That Klutz . They send him back here , I 'll kick his ass good .
DARYLL LEE: Helen , how is life , you okay ? Come see me , talk to me . I think about you , worry about you all the time . I am so glad Jesus did n't let me kill you . You know you 're lessed by Jesus . That 's why you need to come talk to me , because Jesus kept you alive for a reason , and I was his sacred instrument In the moment Satan was in my heart aising my hand to kill you , Jesus took my hand to spare you . I am oth death and life to you Helen hangs up . M.J. has already left
RUBEN: Wait a minute , wait a goddamn minute He manhandles the KID INTO DOCILITY WHILE

NIKKO: Take it easy , Kid . Nobody 's gon na do anything . Just let the gun down , so it do n't go off
KID: Nobody comes through the door
NIKKO: Christ . I did n't lock the fucking drawer ! You spend twenty years thinking some perp 's gon na whack you you 'll crash your car but what happens is , you fuck yourself You ca n't imagine how many times I saw you two your head together , I wish him dead .

SAKS: Well , thank you , too .
SWAT COMM: Peter Foley , we are the police . Will you please come to your front door , and come out with your hands above your head
SUSAN: I am here with Lieutenant Quinn of the Homicide Division and Saks of the FBI . Can you tell us what happened here , tonight ?
QUINN: Susan , the San Francisco Police Department , assisted by the FBI , developed evidence that the serial killer , referred to as the Copycat killer was an individual who esided at this address . Upon eing asked to step out of the house to be interviewed , the suspect set fire to the house possibly to destroy evidence of his wife 's murder . We found her dead of gunshot wounds in an upstairs edroom . He himself died in the fire . No , we 'll wait until we 've located any relatives who should be notified . Witnesses saw the individual burn to death , they were unable to reach him in time to save him . We 're glad , as the entire city must be glad , this reign of terror is ended . No , no more at this time . Thank you

HELEN: It 's Daryll Lee Cullum , is n't it ?
PETER: Mm-hmm . I ca n't get to you . You have to come to me .
HELEN: You know I ca n't do that .
PETER: Oh , I think you will . Peter rips duct tape off M.J. 's mouth
HELEN: For God 's sake Peter , leave her out of it . You do n't want her , you want me .
PETER: I need her ; she 's a cop . I have to kill a cop , and then
HELEN: You 've been perfect . Do n't spoil the symmetry you have to have a male cop .
PETER: I do n't care she 's a cop . That 's the important thing . Cop-ness , not sex-ness . It wo n't be perfect , but it 'll be good .

PETER: Do n't talk to me about courage . I know death , what it 's like to kill . You 're not a killer you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you did n't make a peep , because you were paralyzed with fear . You chocked . I know something else about you .
HELEN: I have no life anymore . I ruined your life , make me pay for it .

PETER: Back in the driver 's seat again , Doctor ? That old dream study us to see what makes us sick . So you can find a cure they 'd name it after you ? Death is the only cure for people like me .
HELEN: Do it . For God 's sake , now
PETER: You hurt me !
PARAMEDIC: That looks like just a bad bruise . I 'll tape it up if you want to

CASSIUS: Before we proceed any further , hear me speak You are all resolved rather to die than to famish ?
TAMORA: Let us kill him .
PRESSING SLIGHTLY: We are accounted poor citizens , the patricians good The leanness that afflicts us , the object of our misery , our sufferance , is a gain to them . Let us evenge this with our sticks ere we ecome rakes ! I speak this in hunge for bread , not in thirst for revenge . A woman , a YOUNG MOTHER , protests
YOUNG MOTHER: Will you proceed especially against Caius Martius ?
CASSIUS: Against him first . A COLLEGE PROFESSOR , speaks up
COLLEGE PROFESSOR: Consider you what services he has done for his country ?
SNAPS: Very well , and could be content to give
COLLEGE PROFESSOR: Nay , but speak not maliciously .
TAMORA: I say unto you , what he hath done famously , he did it to that end He did it to please his mother . Some laugh at her gossip .
CASSIUS: Soft , who comes here ?
COLLEGE PROFESSOR: Worthy Senator Menenius , one that hath always loved the people .
TAMORA: He 's one honest enough ; would all the est were so .
ON TV: Why , masters , my good friends , mine honest neighbors , Will you undo yourselves ?
SMILES BENEVOLENTLY: I tell you , friends , most charitable care Have the patricians of you , For your wants , Your suffering in this dearth , you may as
WELL: Strike at the heavens with your staves as
LIFT THEM: Against the Roman state
TAMORA: Suffer us to famish , and thei storehouses crammed with grain The others shush her .
ON TV: Alack , you are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you ; and you
SLANDER: The helms of the state , who care for you like fathers , When you curse them as enemies
CASSIUS: Care for us ? They never cared for us yet !
TAMORA: If the wars eat us not up , they will and that 's all the love they bear us .
CASSIUS: Why stay we prating here ?
TAMORA: No more talking on it ! To the Capitol ! Come ! Come !
MARTIUS: What 's the matter , you dissentious ogues , That , rubbing the poor itch of you opinion , Make yourselves scabs ?
SARCASTIC: We have ever your good word .
SNAPS: He that will give good words to thee will
FLATTER: Beneath abhorring .
MARTIUS: What would you have , you curs ? He that trusts to you , Where he should find you lions , finds you
HARES;: Where foxes , geese .
MARTIUS: Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate Hang ye ! Trust ye ? With every minute you do change you mind , And call him noble that was now you hate , Him vile that was your garland .
ELSE: Would feed on one another ?
MARTIUS: Go GET YOU HOME , YOU FRAGMENTS ! A tense beat . The riot police shift nervously . The crowd is unsure . The TV news crew films everything .
MENENIUS: These are almost thoroughly persuaded ; For though abundantly they lack discretion , Yet are they passing cowardly .
MARTIUS: They are dissolved . Hang 'em .
MENENIUS: I would they were abed .
MARTIUS: I would they were in Tiber . They move off .
ON TV: Go GET YOU HOME , YOU FRAGMENTS !
COMINIUS: The news is the Volsces are in arms .
MARTIUS: I sin in envying his nobility , And were I any thing but what I am , I would wish me only he .
SENATOR: You have fought together ?
MARTIUS: He is a lion That I am proud to hunt .
TITUS: Lead you on .
VOLSCE POLITICIAN: So , your opinion is , Aufidius , That they of Rome are entered in ou
COUNSELS: And know how we proceed .
SNAPS: Is it not yours ? Tis not four days gone since I heard thence .
VOLSCE OFFICER: We never yet made doubt but Rome was
READY: To answer us .
VOLSCE POLITICIAN: And it is rumored Martius , your old enemy , leads in their preparation .
AUFIDIUS: If we and Caius Martius chance to meet , 'T is sworn between us we shall eve
STRIKE: Till one can do no more . By the elements , If ever again I meet him beard to beard , He 's mine or I am his .
VOLUMNIA: I pray you , daughter , sing , or express yourself in a more comfortable sort . If my son were my husband , I should more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his ed where he would show most love .
VIRGILIA: But had he died in the business , madam , how then ?
VOLUMNIA: Then his good report should have been my son . Had I a dozen sons I had rather have eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action .
MAID: Madam , Senator Menenius is come to visit you .
VOLUMNIA: Tell Menenius we are fit to bid him welcome . The Maid goes .
VIRGILIA: Beseech you , give me leave to retire myself .
VOLUMNIA: Indeed , you shall not !
DRUM;: Methinks I see him stamp thus , and call
BROW: Then wiping , forth he goes .
VIRGILIA: His bloody brow ? 0 Jupiter , no blood
VOLUMNIA: Away , you fool ! It more becomes a man Than gold his trophy .
VIRGILIA: Heavens bless my lord from fell Auf idius
VOLUMNIA: He 'll beat Aufidius ' head below his knee And tread upon his neck .
MENENIUS: My ladies both , good day to you .
TO VIRGILIA: And how does your little son ?
VIRGILIA: I thank you , sir ; well , good .
VOLUMNIA: He had rather play with swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster .
MENENIUS: On my word , the father 's son ! He and Volumnia laugh .
VIRGILIA: No , good sir , I will not out of doors .
MENENIUS: Not out of doors !
VOLUMNIA: She shall , she shall .
VIRGILIA: Indeed , no , by your patience . I 'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars .
MENENIUS: Fie , you confine yourself most unreasonably .
VIRGILIA: I can not go hither .
PLAYFULLY: You would be another Penelope ; yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses ' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths .
VIRGILIA: No , good sir , pardon me ; indeed , I will not forth .
MENENIUS: Go with me and I 'll tell you excellent news of your husband .
VIRGILIA: 0 , good sir , there can be none yet .
MENENIUS: There came news from him last night . Volumnia pounces , moving in
VOLUMNIA: Indeed ?
MENENIUS: Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down efore the Volscian city of Corioles . They nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars This is true , on mine honor ; and so , I pray , go out with us .
AGAIN DECLINING: Give me excuse , good sir . I will obey you in everything hereafter .
SNAPS: Let her alone . As she is now , she will ut disease our better mirth .
MARTIUS: They fear us not , but issue forth thei city .
MARTIUS: You souls of geese , That bear the shapes of men ! PLUTO AND
PALE: With flight and agued fear ! Mend and charge home , Or , by the fires of heaven , I 'll leave
MARTIUS: Look to it . Come on !
TITUS: What is become of Martius ?
SOLDIER 1: Slain , sir , doubtless .
SOLDIER 2: He is himself alone , To answer all the city .
TITUS: Thou art lost , Martius
MARTIUS: Come I too late ? ! Come I too late ? !
TITUS: Ay , if you come not in the blood of others , But mantled in your own .
MARTIUS: 0 , let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I wooed , in
HEART: As merry as when our nuptial day was done !
MARTIUS: There is the man of my soul 's hate
AUFIDIUS: Piercing our Romans .
TITUS: Worthy sir , thou bleeds . Thy exercise hath been too violent For a second course of fight .
MARTIUS: Sir , praise me not . My work hath yet not warmed me . The blood I drop is more medicinal Than dangerous to me . To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight .
TO SOLDIERS: If any such be here- As it were sin to doubt - that love this
HIMSELF;: Let him alone , or so many so minded , Wave thus , to express his disposition ,
THEY GO: Then Martius is hit
BLOOD SPRAYS: But still he keeps on The front of the hotel is closer now
MARTIUS: I 'll fight with none but thee , for I do hate thee .
AUFIDIUS: We hate alike . Then Martius does something astounding .
THEN: Another EXPLOSION rocks the hotel Part of the roof COLLAPSES Concrete SLAMS down
COMINIUS: If I should tell thee over this thy day 's work , Thou would not believe thy deeds .
SMILES;: Where great patricians shall attend and shrug , In the end admire and say `` We thank the
GODS: Our Rome hath such a soldier . ''
SHIFTING PAINFULLY: Pray now , no more . My mother , When she does praise me , grieves me . I have done as you have done - that 's what I can ; Induced as you have been - that 's for my country .
TITUS: Rome must know The value of her own . It were a
CONCEALMENT: Worse than a theft , To hide your doings .
MARTIUS: I have some wounds upon me , and they
SMART: To hear themselves remembered .
COMINIUS: Should they not , Well might they fester against
INGRATITUDE: Too modest are you .
TO COMINIUS: I will go wash ; And when my face is fair , you shall
PERCEIVE: Whether I blush or no Howbeit , thank you . Martius stares at the dead soldier .
AUFIDIUS: Five times , Martius , I have fought with thee ; so often hast thou beat me , And would do so , I think , should we
ENCOUNTER: As often as we eat .
FOR WHERE: I thought to crush him in an equal force , True sword to sword , I 'll stab him some way , Or wrath or craft may get him .
SOLDIER: He 's the devil .
AUFIDIUS: Bolder , though not so subtle .
SICINIUS: Was ever man so proud as is this Martius ?
CASSIUS: He has no equal .
SICINIUS: When we were chosen Tribunes for the
BRUTUS: Marked you his lip and eyes ?
SICINIUS: Nay , but his taunts .
MENENIUS: The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight .
BRUTUS: Good or bad ?
MENENIUS: Not according to the prayer of the people , for they love not Martius .
SICINIUS: Nature teaches beasts to know thei friends .
MENENIUS: You blame Martius for being proud ?
BRUTUS: We do it not alone , sir .
MENENIUS: I know you can do very little alone You talk of pride 0 that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks , and make but an interior survey of you good selves ! 0 that you could !
BRUTUS: What then , sir ?
MENENIUS: Why , then you should discover a brace of unmeriting , proud , violent , testy magistrates , alias fools , as any in Rome .
SICINIUS: Menenius , you are known well enough too .
MENENIUS: I am known to be a humorous patrician , and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it ; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning . What I think I utter , and spend my malice in my breath .
BRUTUS: Come , sir , come , we know you well enough .
MENENIUS: You know neither me , yourselves no anything You are ambitious .
VOLUMNIA: Honorable Menenius , my boy Martius approaches ! For the love of Juno , let 's go .
MENENIUS: Is he not wounded ? He was wont to come home wounded .
VIRGILIA: 0 , no , no , no
VICTORIOUSLY: 0 , he is wounded ! I thank the gods fo it .
MENENIUS: So do I too if it be not too much . Brings a victory in his pocket , the wounds become him . Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly ?
VOLUMNIA: Titus Lartius says they fought together , ut Aufidius got off .
VIRGILIA: In truth , there 's wondrous things spoke of him . Gods grant them true .
VOLUMNIA: True ? !
MENENIUS: I 'll be sworn they are true . Where is he wounded ?
VOLUMNIA: In the shoulder and in the left arm . There will be large scars to show the people , when he shall stand for his place He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts in the body .
MENENIUS: One in the neck , and two in the thigh - there 's nine that I know .
VOLUMNIA: He had , before this last expedition , twenty-five wounds upon him .
MENENIUS: Now it 's twenty-seven . Every gash was an enemy 's grave .
BEFORE HIM: He carries noise , and behind him he leaves tears . Death , that dark spirit , in his nervy arm
DOTH LIE;: Which , being advanced , declines , and then men die .
COMINIUS: Be it known , As to us , to all the world , that Caius
MARTIUS: Wears this war 's garland And from this time , For what he did before Corioles , call him , With all the applause and clamor of the host , `` Caius Martius Coriolanus ! ''
TO MARTIUS: Bear the addition nobly ever ! The soldiers salute in a grim sort of chant
SOLDIERS: Caius Martius Coriolanus !
CORIOLANUS: No more of this ; it does offend my heart . Pray now , no more .
COMINIUS: Look , sir , your mother .
VOLUMNIA: Nay , my good soldier , up . My gentle Martius , worthy Caius , and By deed-achieving honor newly named - What is it ? - Coriolanus must I call thee ?
CORIOLANUS: My gracious silence , hail .
MENENIUS: Now , the gods crown thee !
CORIOLANUS: And live you yet ?
LAUGHS: I know not where to turn . 0 , welcome home ! And welcome , general . And you 're welcome all !
MENENIUS: A hundred thousand welcomes !
CORIOLANUS: The good Senators must be visited ; From whom I have received not only greetings , But with them change of honors .
VOLUMNIA: I have lived To see inherited my very wishes And the buildings of my fancy . Only There 's one thing wanting , which I doubt
NOT BUT: Our Rome will cast upon thee . He catches her eye in the mirror , very firm
CORIOLANUS: Know , good mother , I had rather be their servant in my way , Than sway with them in theirs . They stop when Virgilia enters .
SICINIUS: He can not temperately transport his honors , but will Lose those he hath won .
BRUTUS: I heard him swear , Were he to stand for Consul , never would
HE: Appear in the marketplace no Showing , as the manner is , his wounds To the people , beg `` their stinking eaths . ''
SICINIUS: It was his word .
BRUTUS: So it must fall out with him , Or our authorities at an end .
SICINIUS: We must suggest to the people in what
HATRED: He still hath held them .
SHUSHING HIM: Peace
MENENIUS: Therefore , please you , Most reverend and grave elders , to desire The present Consul , and last general In our well-found successes , to report A little of that worthy work performed By Caius Martius Coriolanus .
SENATOR: Speak , good Cominius .
MENENIUS: Nay , keep your place .
SENATOR: Sit , Coriolanus . Never shame to hea What you have nobly done .
CORIOLANUS: Your honors ' pardon . I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them .
MENENIUS: Pray now , sit down .
CORIOLANUS: I had rather have one scratch my head in
THE SUN: When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered .
COMINIUS: The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly . It is held That valor is the chiefest virtue , and Most dignifies the haver . Alone he
ENTERED: The mortal gate of the city , And struck Corioles like a planet , From face to foot He was a thing of blood
MENENIUS: The Senate , Coriolanus , are well pleased To make thee Consul ! Menenius steps back . A beat .
CORIOLANUS: I do owe them still My life and services . A beat .
MENENIUS: It then remains That you do speak to the people .
CORIOLANUS: I do beseech you , Let me overleap that custom , for I can not
ENTREAT THEM: For my wounds ' sake to give thei suffrage . Please you that I may pass this doing .
SICINIUS: Sir , the people Must have their voices !
MENENIUS: Pray you , go fit you to the custom .
CORIOLANUS: It is a part That I shall blush in acting , and might
WELL: Be taken from the people .
TO SICINIUS: Mark you that ?
CORIOLANUS: To brag unto them `` Thus I did , and thus ! '' Show them the unaching scars which I should hide , As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only !
MENENIUS: To our noble Consul Wish we all joy and honor !
AGREES: Custom calls me to it . What custom wills , in all things should we do What must I say ? `` Look , sir , my wounds . I got them in my country 's service . ''
MENENIUS: O me , the gods ! You must not speak like that . You must
DESIRE THEM: To think upon you
CORIOLANUS: `` Think upon me '' ? Hang 'em ! I would they would forget me .
MENENIUS: You 'll mar all !
SOURLY: Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean . He leaves the car .
TO CASSIUS: You know the cause , sir , of my standing here .
CASSIUS: We do , sir . Tell us what hath brought you to it .
CORIOLANUS: Mine own desert .
TAMORA: Your own desert ?
CORIOLANUS: Ay , but not mine own desire .
TAMORA: How not your own desire ?
CORIOLANUS: No , it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging .
CASSIUS: You must think , if we give you anything , we hope to gain by you .
CORIOLANUS: Well then , I pray , your price of the Consulship ?
WAR VET: The price is to ask it kindly .
CORIOLANUS: Kindly , sir , I pray , let me have it . I have wounds to show you , which shall be yours in private Your good voice , sir . What say you ?
IMPRESSED: You shall have it , worthy sir .
CORIOLANUS: A match , sir . There 's in all two worthy voices begged . I have your alms . Adieu .
CASSIUS: But this is something odd .
CORIOLANUS: Pray you now , if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be Consul .
JAMAICAN WOMAN: You have deserved nobly of your country , and you have not deserved nobly .
CORIOLANUS: Your enigma ?
JAMAICAN WOMAN: You have been a scourge to her enemies ; you have been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common people .
CORIOLANUS: You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love Therefore , beseech you , I may be Consul .
SHOPKEEPER: We hope to find you our friend , and therefore give you our voices heartily .
JAMAICAN WOMAN: You have received many wounds for you country .
CORIOLANUS: I will not seal your knowledge with showing them . I will make much of you voices , and so trouble you no farther .
JAMAICAN WOMAN: The gods give you joy , sir , heartily !
CORIOLANUS: Your voices ! For your voices I have
FOUGHT;: Watched for your voices ; for your voices
BEAR: Of wounds two dozen odd ; battles thrice
SIX: I have seen and heard of !
CORIOLANUS: For your voices Have done many things , some less , some more . Your voices ! Indeed , I would be Consul .
WAR VET: He has done nobly , and can not go without any honest man 's voice !
JAMAICAN WOMAN: The gods give him joy , and make him good friend to the people ! The Citizens applaud and give their support
CITIZENS: Amen , amen . God save thee , noble Consul !
CORIOLANUS: Worthy voices !
MENENIUS: You have stood your limitation , and the
TRIBUNES: Endue you with the people 's voice .
CORIOLANUS: Is this done ?
SICINIUS: The custom of request you have discharged . The people do admit you , and are summoned To meet anon upon your approbation .
CORIOLANUS: Where ? At the Senate ?
SICINIUS: There , Coriolanus .
MENENIUS: I 'll keep you company .
TO BRUTUS: Will you along ?
DECLINES: We stay here for the people .
SICINIUS: How now , my masters ! Have you chose this man ?
RUEFULLY: He has our voices , sir .
BRUTUS: We pray the gods he may deserve you loves .
TAMORA: Amen , sir . To my poor unworthy notice , He mocked us when he begged our voices .
CERTAINLY: He flouted us downright .
JAMAICAN WOMAN: No , it is his kind of speech ; he did not mock us .
SHARPLY: He should have showed us His marks of merit , wounds received for 's country .
SICINIUS: Why , so he did , I am sure .
TAMORA: No , no ! No one saw them !
CASSIUS: Was not this mockery ? Brutus presses hard
BRUTUS: When he had no power , But was a petty servant to the state , He was your enemy , ever spake against Your liberties .
SICINIUS: Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves , and do you
THINK: That his contempt shall not be bruising
TO YOU: When he hath power to crush ?
CASSIUS: He 's not confirmed ; we may deny him yet !
TAMORA: And will deny him ! I 'll have five hundred voices of that sound .
CASSIUS: I twice five hundred and their friends !
SICINIUS: Let them assemble , And on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election .
BRUTUS: Enforce his pride , And his old hate unto you !
SICINIUS: And presently , when you have drawn you number , Repair to the Capitol .
CASSIUS: We will so !
TAMORA: We will so ! All Repent in their election !
TO TITUS: Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army ?
TITUS: He has , my lord .
CORIOLANUS: Saw you Aufidius ?
TITUS: He is retired to Antium .
CORIOLANUS: Spoke he of me ?
TITUS: He did , my lord .
CORIOLANUS: How ? What ?
TITUS: How often he had met you , sword to sword ; That of all things upon the earth he
HATED: Your person most .
CORIOLANUS: At Antium lives he ?
TITUS: At Antium .
CORIOLANUS: I wish I had a cause to seek him there , To oppose his hatred fully .
TO TITUS: Behold , these are the Tribunes of the people , The tongues of the common mouth .
SICINIUS: Pass no further .
CORIOLANUS: Ha ! What is that ?
BRUTUS: It will be dangerous to go on . No further .
CORIOLANUS: What makes this change ?
MENENIUS: The matter ?
COMINIUS: Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons ?
BRUTUS: Cominius , no .
CORIOLANUS: Have I had children 's voices ?
TITUS: Tribunes , give way .
BRUTUS: The people are incensed against him .
CORIOLANUS: ( glancing to the growing
CROWD: Are these your herd ?
MENENIUS: Be calm , be calm .
BRUTUS: The people cry you mocked them , and of late called them Time-pleasers , flatterers , foes to nobleness .
CORIOLANUS: But this was known before .
SICINIUS: You show too much of that For which the people stir . If you will
PASS: To where you are bound , you must inquire your way .
MENENIUS: Let 's be calm
COMINIUS: The people are abused , set on
MENENIUS: Not now , not now
TITUS: Not in this heat , sir
CORIOLANUS: My nobler friends , I crave their pardons . For the mutable , rank-scented crowd , Let them regard me as I do not flatter , And therein behold themselves . I say again , In soothing them , we nourish against ou
SENATE: The cockle of rebellion , insolence , sedition , Which we ourselves have ploughed for , sowed , and scattered , By mingling them with us !
MENENIUS: Well , no more !
TITUS: No more words , we beseech you The mob has surrounded them all by now .
BRUTUS: You speak of the people As if you were a god to punish , not A man of their infirmity .
SICINIUS: It were well we let the people know it .
CORIOLANUS: Were I as patient as the midnight sleep , By Jove , it would be my mind !
SICINIUS: It is a mind That shall remain a poison where it is , Not poison any further .
EXPLODES: `` Shall remain '' ! Hear you this Triton of the minnows ? Mark
YOU: His absolute `` shall '' ?
BRUTUS: Why , should the people give One that speaks thus their voice ?
CORIOLANUS: I 'll give my reasons , More worthier than their voices !
ACHES: To know , when two authorities are up , Neither supreme , how soon confusion , May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take The one by the other .
CORIOLANUS: Thus we debase the nature of our seats , and make the rabble Call our cares fears ; which will in time Break ope the locks of the Senate , and
BRING IN: The crows to peck the eagles !
MENENIUS: Come , enough !
BRUTUS: Enough , with over-measure .
SICINIUS: He has spoken like a traitor , and shall
ANSWER: As traitors do !
CORIOLANUS: Thou wretch , despite overwhelm thee !
BRUTUS: Manifest treason !
SICINIUS: This is a Consul ? No !
CORIOLANUS: Hence , old goat !
FOR POSITION: Menenius pulls Coriolanus off
MENENIUS: On both sides more respect !
SICINIUS: Here 's he that would take from you all your power !
BRUTUS: You are at point to lose your liberties ! Martius would have all from you , Martius , Whom late you have named for Consul .
SICINIUS: What is the city but the people ? !
TAMORA: True ! The people are the city !
SICINIUS: We do here pronounce , upon the part of the people , Martius is worthy of present DEATH !
BRUTUS: Guards , seize him !
CORIOLANUS: No , I 'll die here !
BRUTUS: Lay hands upon him !
MENENIUS: Go , get you to your house ! Be gone , away ! All will be naught else
COMINIUS: Come , sir , along with us They hurry Coriolanus away
SCREAMS: TV news crew filming Chaotic , flurried violence Shaky TV images , cell phone video Choking , acrid gas
URGENTLY: As I do know the Consul 's worthiness , So can I name his faults
SICINIUS: Consul ! What Consul ?
MENENIUS: The Consul Coriolanus .
BRUTUS: He Consul ? !
SICINIUS: It is decreed He dies tonight .
TAMORA: He 's a disease that must be cut away .
MENENIUS: 0 , he 's a limb that has but a disease Mortal , to cut it off ; to cure it , easy . What has he done to Rome that 's worth his death ? Eh ? Killing our enemies ? !
BRUTUS: We 'll hear no more
MENENIUS: Consider this he has been bred in the
WARS: Since he could draw a sword , and is ill
SCHOOLED: In graceful language Give me leave , I 'll go to him , and undertake to bring
HIM: Where he shall answer by a lawful form , In peace , to his utmost peril .
ANOTHER SENATOR: The other course Will prove too bloody , and the end of it Unknown to the beginning .
BRUTUS: Be you then as the people 's officer .
MENENIUS: I 'll bring him to you . He goes quickly .
CORIOLANUS: Let them pull all about mine ears ,
PRESENT ME: Death on the wheel or at wild horses ' heels , Yet will I still be thus to them !
CONTINUING UNABATED: I muse my mothe Does not approve me further ! He slams through a door to the living room
CORIOLANUS: I talk of you ! Why did you wish me milder ? Would you
HAVE ME: False to my nature ? Rather say I play The man I am !
VOLUMNIA: 0 , sir , sir , sir , I would have had you put your power well on , Before you had worn it out .
CORIOLANUS: Let go !
VOLUMNIA: You might have been enough the man you are , With striving less to be so !
CORIOLANUS: Let them hang !
VOLUMNIA: Av , and burn too !
TO CORIOLANUS: Come , come , you have been too rough , something too rough . You must return and mend it . Coriolanus turns away .
VOLUMNIA: Pray , be counseled . I have a heart as little apt as yours , But yet a brain that leads my use of
ANGER: To better vantage .
MENENIUS: Well said , noble woman !
CORIOLANUS: What must I do ?
MENENIUS: Return to the Tribunes .
CORIOLANUS: Well , what then ? What then ?
MENENIUS: Repent what you have spoke .
CORIOLANUS: For them ? I can not do it to the gods . Must I then do it to them ?
VOLUMNIA: You are too absolute , Though therein you can never be too noble .
CORIOLANUS: Why force you this ? She pursues him
VOLUMNIA: Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people , not by your own instruction , Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you , But with such words that are but
REHEARSED IN: Your tongue , though but bastards and
SYLLABLES: Of no allowance to your bosom 's truth
VOLUMNIA: I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake
REQUIRED: I should do so in honor
VOLUMNIA: I am in this your wife , your son , These senators , the nobles And you .
BROILS: Has not the soft way In asking their good loves ; but thou wilt
FRAME: Thyself , forsooth , hereafter theirs .
MENENIUS: This but done , even as she speaks , Why their hearts were yours .
VOLUMNIA: Prithee now , Go , and be ruled Although I know thou hadst rathe Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower .
COMINIUS: Sir , it is fit You make strong party , or defend yourself By calmness or by absence . All 's in anger .
MENENIUS: Only fair speech .
COMINIUS: I think it will serve , if he Can thereto frame his spirit .
VOLUMNIA: He must and will .
TO CORIOLANUS: Prithee now , say you will , and go about it .
MUST I: With base tongue give my noble heart A lie that it must bear ? . Well , I will do it .
BITTERLY: Away , my disposition , and possess me Some harlot 's spirit . A beggar 's tongue Make motion through my lips , and my armed knees , Who bowed but in my stirrup , bend like
HIS: That hath charity received !
CORIOLANUS: I will not do it ! Lest I cease to honor mine own truth And by my body 's action teach my mind A most inherent baseness .
VOLUMNIA: At thy choice , then ! To beg of thee , it is my more dishono Than thou of them . Come all to ruin ! Let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than
FEAR: Thy dangerous stoutness , for I mock at
DEATH: With as biq heart as thou ! Do as you like ! The words echo .
CORIOLANUS: Pray , be content Mother , I am going , chide me no more . He awaits her approval . She will not yet grant it .
VOLUMNIA: Do your will . Then she kisses him . And she goes . Like a queen . Volumnia triumphant . Always . Then a shocking hard cut to
TO SICINIUS: In this point charge him home that he
AFFECTS: Tyrannical power . If he evade us there , Enforce him with his envy to the people .
TO TAMORA: Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procured Set down by the poll ?
TAMORA: I have ; it 's ready .
SICINIUS: When the people hear me say `` It shall be
SO: In the right and strength of the Commons , '' be it eithe For death , for fine , or banishment , then let them , If I say `` Fine , '' cry `` Fine ! '' - if `` Death , '' cry `` Death ! ''
TAMORA: We shall inform them .
ARM YOURSELF: To answer mildly , for they are prepared With accusations , as I hear , more strong Than are upon you yet .
CORIOLANUS: The word is `` mildly . '' Pray you , let us go . Let them accuse me by invention , I Will answer in mine honor .
MENENIUS: Ay , but mildly .
CORIOLANUS: Well , mildly be it then . Mildly !
BRUTUS: Put him to choler straight .
MENENIUS: Calmly , I do beseech you . Coriolanus steps to the microphone . Brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down .
CORIOLANUS: The honored gods
JUSTICE: Supplied with worthy men . Plant love among us . Throng our large temples with the shows of peace , And not our streets with war .
COMINIUS: Amen , amen .
MENENIUS: A noble wish .
CORIOLANUS: Shall I be charged no further than this present ? Must all determine here ?
SICINIUS: I do demand , If you submit you to the people 's voices .
CORIOLANUS: I am content .
MENENIUS: Lo , citizens , he says he is content . The warlike service he has done ,
CONSIDER; THINK: Upon the wounds his body bears , which
SHOW: Like graves in the holy churchyard .
CORIOLANUS: Scratches with briers , Scars to move laughter only .
MENENIUS: Consider further , That when he speaks not like a citizen , You find him like a soldier . Do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds , But , as I say , such as become a soldier .
CORIOLANUS: What is the matte That being passed for Consul with full voice , I am so dishonored that the very hou You take it off again ?
SICINIUS: We charge you that you have contrived to
TAKE: From Rome all seasoned office , and to
WIND: Yourself into a power tyrannical
CORIOLANUS: How ? Traitor ? !
ALARMED: Nay , temperately ! Your promise .
CORIOLANUS: The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people ! Call me their traitor , thou injurious Tribune !
CALLING: Mark you this , people ? !
BRUTUS: But since he hath Served well for Rome
SNAPS: What do you prate of service ?
BRUTUS: I talk of that , that know it .
CORIOLANUS: You ? ! I 'll know no further . Let them pronounce death , exile , Flaying , pent to linge But with a grain a day - I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fai word !
SICINIUS: In the name of the people And in the power of us the Tribunes , we , Even from this instant , banish him ou city ! In the people 's name , I say IT SHALL BE SO !
CROWD: It shall be so ! It shall be so ! Let him away !
TAMORA: He 's banished ! IT SHALL BE SO !
CROWD: It shall be so ! It shall be so ! It shall e so !
STEPPING FORWARD: Hear me , my masters , and my common friends !
SICINIUS: He 's sentenced . No more hearing .
COMINIUS: Let me speak ! The crowd 's fury is building It is all about to erupt
BRUTUS: There 's no more to be said , but he is
BANISHED: As enemy to the people and his country .
CROWD: It shall be so ! It shall be so ! It shall e so !
CORIOLANUS EXPLODES: His rage is volcanic He SLAMS the standing microphone away
PRIZE: As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air
CORIOLANUS: Here remain with your uncertainty . Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts ! Your enemies , with nodding of thei plumes , Fan you into despair ! Have the powe
STILL: To banish your defenders , till at length Your ignorance - which finds not till it feels ,
CORIOLANUS: Despising , For you , the city , thus I turn my back .
TAMORA: The people 's enemy is gone ! The crowd SCREAMS their approval . The SAVAGE CRY echoes around the studio . The echoing roar takes us to
TO VIRGILIA: Come , leave your tears . A brief farewell .
THE BEAST: With many heads butts me away .
CORIOLANUS: Nay , mother , Where is your ancient courage ?
VOLUMNIA: Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome , And occupations perish !
CORIOLANUS: Nay , mother , I shall be loved when I am lacked .
EMBRACING TITUS: Bid me farewell .
TITUS: Farewell , Martius .
EMBRACING COMINIUS: Cominius , droop not , adieu . I 'll do well yet .
CORIOLANUS: Thou old and true Menenius , Thy tears are salter than a younge man 's , And venomous to thine eyes .
DEEPLY: If I could shake off but seven years I 'd go with thee every foot . They embrace .
CORIOLANUS: You shall hear from me still . He turns and looks to the distance . Miles and miles of wasteland and desolation .
BRUTUS: Here comes his mother .
SICINIUS: Let 's not meet her . They say she 's mad . Volumnia stalks up to them
VOLUMNIA: 0 , you 're well met . The hoarded plague of
THE GODS: Requite your love !
VOLUMNIA: Will you be gone ?
VIRGILIA: You shall stay too . I would I had the
POWER: To say so to my husband .
SICINIUS: Are you mad ?
VOLUMNIA: Ay , fool , is that a shame ? Note but this ,
ROME: Than thou hast spoken words ?
SICINIUS: 0 blessed heavens
VOLUMNIA: More noble blows than ever thou wise words , And for Rome 's good . I 'll tell thee what -
YET GO: Nay but thou shalt stay too I would
MY SON: Were in Arabia , and thy tribe before him , His good sword in his hand .
SICINIUS: What then ?
VIRGILIA: What then ? He 'd make an end of thy posterity .
VOLUMNIA: Bastards and all .
MENENIUS: Come , come , peace
BRUTUS: Pray , let us go .
VOLUMNIA: Now , pray , sir , get you gone . You have done a brave deed . Ere you go ,
BRUTUS: Well , well , we 'll leave you .
SICINIUS: Why stay we to be baited With one that wants her wits ?
VOLUMNIA: I would the gods had nothing else to do But to confirm my curses !
MENENIUS: You have told them home ; And , by my troth , you have cause . You 'll sup with me ?
VOLUMNIA: Anger 's my meat . I sup upon myself , And so shall starve with feeding . She takes Virgilia 's hand and drags her out . Menenius watches . Saddened . Once proud Volumnia , reduced to this .
HE MOVES: A steady stride He walks right up to the Guards Before they can even respond
THE FACE: He flings the Guard aside
AUFIDIUS: Whence comes thou ? What wouldst thou ? Thy name ? Coriolanus does not respond .
CORIOLANUS: A name unmusical to the Volscians ' ears , And harsh in sound to thine .
AUFIDIUS: Say , what 's thy name ? Thou has a grim appearance .What 's thy name ?
CORIOLANUS: Know'st thou me yet ?
AUFIDIUS: I know thee not Thy name ?
CORIOLANUS: My name is Caius Martius , who hath done To thee particularly and to all the
VOLSCES: Great hurt and mischief ; thereto witness
MAY: My surname Coriolanus .
CORIOLANUS: Only that name remains .
WORLD: I would have avoided thee , but in mere spite , To be full quit of those my banishers , Stand I before thee here .
CORIOLANUS: I will fight Against my cankered country with the
SPLEEN: Of all the under fiends . But if thou Dares not this , then I present My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
CORIOLANUS: Which not to cut would show thee but a fool , Since I have ever followed thee with hate , And can not live but to thy shame unless It be to do thee service . A long beat . Aufidius stares at Coriolanus .
AUFIDIUS: O Martius Martius Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy . He offers his hand .
KNOW THOU: I loved the maid I married ; never man Sighed truer breath . But that I see thee here , Thou noble thing , more dances my rapt
HEART: Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold .
AUFIDIUS: Why , thou Mars , I tell thee , We have a power on foot , and I had
PURPOSE: Once more to hew thy target from thy awn ,
ME OUT: Twelve several times , and I have nightly
SINCE: Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me .
AUFIDIUS: Worthy Martius , Had we no quarrel else to Rome , but that Thou art thence banished , we would muste
ALL: From twelve to seventy , and , pouring wa Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome , Like a bold flood , overbear it .
AUFIDIUS: 0 , come , go in , And take our friendly senators by the hands . Coriolanus shakes hands with the politicians
CORIOLANUS: You bless me , gods .
AUFIDIUS: Therefore , most absolute sir , if thou
WILT HAVE: The leading of thine own revenges , take The one half of my commission .
AUFIDIUS: And set down- As best thou art experienced , since thou
KNOWS: Thy country 's strength and weakness- thine own ways , Whether to knock against the gates of Rome , Or rudely visit them in parts remote , To fright them ere destroy .
BRUTUS: Is this Menenius ?
SICINIUS: 'T is he , 't is he ! 0 , he is grown most kind of late . Hail sir !
MENENIUS: Hail to you both .
YOUR CORIOLANUS: Is not much missed , but with his friends .
MENENIUS: All 's well , and might have been much
BETTER IF: He could have temporized .
SICINIUS: Where is he , hear you ?
MENENIUS: Nay , I hear nothing . His mother and his
WIFE: Hear nothing from him .
BRUTUS: Caius Martius was A worthy officer in the war , but insolent , Overcome with pride , ambitious past all thinking ,
MENENIUS: I think not so .
SICINIUS: And Rome sits safe and still without him .
ON TV: Reports the Volsces with two several
POWERS: Are entered in the Roman territories , And with the deepest malice of the wa Destroy what lies before them
MENENIUS: 'T is Aufidius , Who , hearing of our Martius ' banishment , Thrusts forth his horns again into the world .
NERVOUS: Come , what talk you of Martius ?
BRUTUS: It can not be the Volsces dare break with us .
ON TV: The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the Senate House . Some news is
COMING: That turns their countenances Yes , the first report is seconded , and more , More fearful , is delivered .
ON TV: It is spoke freely out of many mouths - How probable I do not know - that Martius Has ioined with Aufidius
ON TV: He leads a power against Rome , And vows revenge as spacious as between The youngest and oldest thing .
AND TOOK: What lay before them .
ON TV: Martius has joined with the Volscians - He is their god . He leads them like Boys pursuing summer butterflies Or butchers killing flies . Close up on Volumnia 's face . She gives away practically nothing . She takes a slow drag on her cigarette .
AUFIDIUS: Do they still fly to Coriolanus ?
LIEUTENANT: I do not know what witchcraft 's in him ,
BUT: Your soldiers use him as the grace before meat , Their talk at table , and their thanks at end . And you are darkened in this action , sir .
AUFIDIUS: He bears himself more proud , Even to my person , than I thought he
WOULD: When first I did embrace him .
LIEUTENANT: Sir , I beseech you , think you he 'll carry Rome ?
GRIM: I think he 'll be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish , who takes
IT: By sovereignty of nature .
AUFIDIUS: Whether t'was pride , Whether defect of judgement , Or whether nature , Not to be other than one thing , Made him feared , So hated , and so banished . A beat as he studies the picture .
ONE NAIL;: Rights by rights founder , strengths by strengths do fail And when , Caius , Rome is thine ,
MENENIUS: No , I 'll not go !
MENENIUS: Go , you that banished him ! A mile before his tent fall down , and
KNEE: The way into his mercy .
TITUS: He would not seem to know me . A beat .
DROPS: That we have bled together . `` Coriolanus '' He would not answer to , forbade all names A long beat . They wait for him to go on . Titus searches for the words to continue .
TITUS: He was a kind of nothing . Titleless Till he had forged himself a name in the
FIRE: Of burning Rome . He has no more to say , his head drops .
SICINIUS: If you refuse your aid
IF YOU: Would be your country 's pleader , you good tongue , More than the instant army we can make , Might stop our countryman .
MENENIUS: No , I 'll not meddle .
SICINIUS: Pray you , go to him .
MENENIUS: What should I do ? Brutus stops him , with real emotion
BRUTUS: Only make trial what your love can do For Rome towards Martius .
MENENIUS: Well , and say that Martius Return me , as Titus is returned , Unheard - what then ?
SICINIUS: Yet your good will Must have that thanks from Rome . Menenius thinks about it .
BRUTUS: You know the very road into his kindness , And can not lose your way .
MENENIUS: I 'll undertake it I think he 'll hear me .
TITUS: He 'll never hear him .
SICINIUS: No ?
TITUS: I tell you , he does sit in gold , his eye Red as it would burn Rome .
MENENIUS: The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity , and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does ! 0 Martius , Martius !
CORIOLANUS: Away .
MENENIUS: How ? . Away ?
ICE: Wife mother child I know not .
MY AFFAIRS: Are servanted to others . Menenius ca n't believe this cold response
CORIOLANUS: Therefore be gone . His frigid eyes slice into Menenius
MENENIUS: This Martius is grown from man to dragon . He has wings ; he 's more than a creeping thing . He stops at his limo .
CORIOLANUS: My partner in this action , You must report to the Volscian lords how
PLAINLY: I have borne this business .
AUFIDIUS: Only their ends You have respected ; stopped your ears
AGAINST: The general suit of Rome ; never admitted A private whisper , no , not with such
FRIENDS: That thought them sure of you .
CORIOLANUS: This last old man , Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to Rome , Loved me above the measure of a father .
VIRGILIA: My lord and husband He stop her , almost a warning , with
CORIOLANUS: These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome .
VIRGILIA: The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so .
CORIOLANUS: Best of my flesh , Forgive my tyranny , but do not say For that `` Forgive our Romans . ''
VOLUMNIA: 0 , stand up blest . He rises .
FLINT: I kneel before thee .
CORIOLANUS: What is this ? Your knees to me ? To your corrected son ?
VOLUMNIA: Thou art my warrior ; I hope to frame thee . She indicates Young Martius
CORIOLANUS: The god of soldiers , Inform thy thoughts with nobleness , that thou may prove To shame invulnerable . Volumnia pulls Young Martius down
VOLUMNIA: Your knee , sir . She pulls Virgilia down
CORIOLANUS: I beseech you , peace ! Or , if you 'd ask , remember this Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers , o
CAPITULATE: Again with Rome 's mechanics . Tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural . Desire not To ally my rages and revenges with Your colder reasons .
VOLUMNIA: 0 , no more , no more ! You have said you will not grant us anything , For we have nothing else to ask but that Which you deny already ; yet we will ask , That , if you fail in our request , the
BLAME: May hang upon your hardness . Therefore hear us .
CORIOLANUS: Aufidius , and you Volsces , mark ; fo
WE'LL: Hear naught from Rome in private . Your request ?
VOLUMNIA: Should we be silent and not speak , ou
RAIMENT: And state of bodies would reveal what
LIFE: We have led since thy exile . Think with
THYSELF: How more unfortunate than all living
WOMEN: Are we come hither , since that thy sight ,
WHICH SHOULD: Make our eyes flow with joy , hearts dance with comforts , Constrains them weep and shake with fea and sorrow , Making the mother , wife , and child to see The son , the husband and the fathe
TEARING: His country 's bowels out .
VOLUMNIA: For myself , son , I propose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine . If I can not
PERSUADE THEE: Rather to show a noble grace , thou shalt
NO SOONER: March to assault thy country than to Tread on thy mother 's wom That brought thee to this world .
STANDS: Ay , and mine , That brought you forth this boy , to keep
YOUR NAME: Living to time .
YOUNG MARTIUS: You shall not tread on me . I 'll run away till I am bigger , but then I 'll fight !
CORIOLANUS: I have sat too long . He rises and turns as if to go
VOLUMNIA: Nay , go not from us thus !
CONDEMN US: As poisonous of your honor . No , our suit Is that you reconcile them so the
SIDE: Give the all-hail to thee and cry , `` Be
BLEST: For making up this peace ! '' Coriolanus does not respond . She softens
VOLUMNIA: Speak to me , son Still he does not respond . His emotions are roiling . Still she is soft and vulnerable
MORE: Than can our reasons . There 's no man in
THE WORLD: More bound to his mother , yet here he lets me prate Like one in the stocks ! She is assaulting him now , on the attack
VOLUMNIA: Thou hast never in thy life Showed thy dear mother any courtesy , When she , poor hen , Has clucked thee to the wars and safely
HOME: Loaded with honor . Say my request 's unjust , And spurn me back ; and the gods will
WHICH: To a mother 's part belongs !
VOLUMNIA: Down ! Let us shame him with our knees !
HAVE: But kneels and holds up hands fo fellowship , Does reason our petition with more
STRENGTH: Than thou hast to deny it . She remains kneeling , panting for air .
VOLUMNIA: Come , let us go .
CORIOLANUS: O mother mother What have you done ? He falls to his knees , clutching her hand .
SCENE: They laugh at . He buries his head in her , like a lost child
CORIOLANUS: O my mother , mother ! 0 ! You have won a happy victory for Rome ; But for your son - believe it , 0 believe it ! - Most dangerously you have with him
PREVAILED: ( he looks up at he
DEEPLY: If not most mortal to him .
CORIOLANUS: But let it come .
HEARD: A mother less ? Or granted less ? Aufidius ?
CAREFULLY: I was moved withal .
CORIOLANUS: I dare be sworn you were . And , sir , it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion . But , good sir , What peace you 'll make , advise me .
COMINIUS: A merrier day did never yet greet Rome , No , not the expulsion of the Tarquins . We have all Great cause to give great thanks . He looks to Volumnia .
LIEUTENANT: How is it with our general ?
AUFIDIUS: As with a man by his own charity slain .
LIEUTENANT: Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'Twixt you there 's difference ; but the
AUFIDIUS: I know it , And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction .
BITTERLY: At the last I seemed his follower , not partner , and He waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary .
LIEUTENANT: So he did , my lord . The army marveled at it ; and in the last , When he had carried Rome and that we
LOOKED: For no less spoil than glory
AUFIDIUS: There was it ! For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him . At a few drops of women 's rheum , which
ARE: As cheap as lies , he sold the blood and
LABOR: Of our great action Therefore shall he die , And I 'll renew me in his fall .
LIEUTENANT: Therefore , at your vantage , Ere he express himself or move the people With what he would say , let him feel you sword , Which we will second .
SEES SOMETHING: Say no more .
TO AUFIDIUS: I am returned your soldier , No more infected with my country 's love Than when I parted hence , but still
SUBSISTING: Under your great command . He hands the treaty portfolio to Aufidius
CORIOLANUS: We have made peace With no less honor to the Volscians Than shame to the Romans .
AUFIDIUS: ( handing the treaty to
LIEUTENANT: Read it not , But tell the traitor , in the highest
DEGREE: He hath abused your powers .
CORIOLANUS: Traitor ? How now ?
AUFIDIUS: Ay , traitor , Martius .
CORIOLANUS: `` Martius '' ?
AUFIDIUS: Ay , Martius , Caius Martius ! Dost thou
THINK: I 'll grace thee with that robbery , thy
STOLEN NAME: `` Coriolanus '' ?
PERFIDIOUSLY: He has betrayed your business and given up , For certain drops of salt , your city Rome- I say `` your city '' - to his wife and
MOTHER;: Breaking his oath and resolution , like A twist of rotten silk ; never admitting Counsel of the war , but at his nurse 's
TEARS: He whined and roared away YOUR VICTORY ! Coriolanus tries to contain his anger
CORIOLANUS: Hear'st thou , Mars ?
AUFIDIUS: Name not the god , thou boy of tears .
CORIOLANUS: Measureless liar , thou has made my heart Too great for what contains it . `` Boy '' ? 0 slave .
THERE: That , like an eagle in a dovecote , I Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles . His gaze burns into Aufidius
CORIOLANUS: Alone I did it `` Boy . ''
AUFIDIUS: Let him die for it . At this command , his men move Aufidius steps back as The Volscian thugs attack With knives , machetes and tire irons

MIRROR CHEV: Bipolar . Sadomasochistic tendencies . Adrenaline junkie . Addicted to violence probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill , the ig rush . Cutting up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement would be like like a GIFT a warrior 's death hell , you 'd probably get off on it
HEV: Did you rehearse this ?
MIRROR CHEV: No , this was the best way for a guy like you a slow , ticking clock winding down inevitable non-negotiable until

CARLITO: That 's enough .
CHEV: You 'll probably throw boss a nice little each-around just to show what a good itch you are .
VERONA: I 'm nobody 's little bitch , you hear me ? He 'll pay what I tell him to pay !
CARLITO: I said that 's enough . It 's been a long day . But in the end , you must agree , it all works out quite nicely . Don Kim gets his bullet , thanks to you

AD: James ? James , are you in there ? Could we please get your stamp of approval on our little tracking shot ?
JAMES: Of course . Be there in a minute .
CAMERA GIRL: It 'll take more than a minute .
JAMES: Where were you ?
CATHERINE: In the private aircraft hangar . Anybody could have walked in .
JAMES: Did you come ?
CATHERINE: No . What about your camera girl ? Did she come ?
JAMES: We were interrupted . I had to go ack to the set
CATHERINE: Poor darling . What can I do about Karen ? How can I arrange to have her seduce me ? She desperately needs a conquest .
JAMES: I 've been thinking about that , about you and Karen .
CATHERINE: There , that 's better .
JAMES: Thank you .
CATHERINE: Not a lot of action here .
JAMES: They consider this to be the airport hospital . This ward is reserved fo air-crash victims . The beds are kept waiting .
CATHERINE: If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you .
JAMES: I 'll listen for you buzzing over .
CATHERINE: Yes . From Wendel . To celebrate the licence approval for our air-charte firm . I forgot to tell you .
JAMES: That 's going well , then .
CATHERINE: Well , yes . You 're getting out of bed tomorrow . They want you to walk .
JAMES: And her husband ? What was he ?
CATHERINE: He was a chemical engineer with a food company .
STUDENT NURSE: No smoking , please .
CATHERINE: Yes .
STUDENT NURSE: You can stay for this , then .
CATHERINE: Aida telephoned to say how sorry she was , but could you look at the storyboards again , she 's made a numbe of changes .
JAMES: Where 's the car ?
CATHERINE: Outside in the visitors ' car-park .
JAMES: What ! ? They brought the car here ?
CATHERINE: My car , not yours . Yours is a complete wreck . The police dragged it to the pound behind the station .
JAMES: Have you seen it ?
CATHERINE: The sergeant asked me to identify it . He did n't believe you 'd gotten out alive .
JAMES: It 's about time .
CATHERINE: It is ?
JAMES: After being bombarded endlessly by oad-safety propaganda , it 's almost a relief to have found myself in an actual accident .
VAUGHAN: James Ballard ?
JAMES: Yes ?
VAUGHAN: Crash victim ?
JAMES: Yes .
VAUGHAN: We 'll deal with these later .
JAMES: Dr. Remington ?
CATHERINE: Both front wheels and the engine were driven back into the driver 's section , bowing the floor . Blood still marked the hood , streamers of lack lace running toward the windshield-wiper gutters .
JAMES: You should have gone to the funeral .
CATHERINE: I wish I had . They bury the dead so quickly they should leave them lying around for months .
JAMES: What about his wife ? The woman doctor ? Have you visited her yet ?
CATHERINE: No , I could n't . I feel too close to her .
JAMES: I ca n't sit on this balcony forever . I 'm beginning to feel like a potted plant .
CATHERINE: How can you drive ? James you legs . You can barely walk .
JAMES: Is the traffic heavier now ? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident .
CATHERINE: I 've never really noticed . Is Renata going with you ?
JAMES: I thought she might come along . Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine .
CATHERINE: I 'm amazed that she 'll let you drive her .
JAMES: You 're not envious ?
CATHERINE: Maybe I am a little . James , I 've got to leave for the office . Are you going to be all right ?
RENATA: Are we allowed to park here ?
JAMES: No .
RENATA: I 'm sure the police would make an exception in your case .
JAMES: There 's still a patch of blood there on the road . Did you see it ?
RENATA: I saw the blood . It looks like moto oil .
JAMES: You were the last one I saw just efore the accident . Do you remember ? We made love .
RENATA: Are you still involving me in you crash ?
JAMES: I can drive .
CATHERINE: I ca n't believe you 've done this .
KAREN: This is the exact same car as you old one , is n't it ?
CATHERINE: Yes , it is . Are you planning to have another ca crash ?
JAMES: I 'm not thinking about the crash at all .
HELEN: After this sort of thing , how do people manage to look at a car , let alone drive one ? I 'm trying to find Charles 's car .
JAMES: It 's not here . Maybe the police are still holding it . Their forensic people
HELEN: They said it was here . They told me this morning .
JAMES: You 'll tear your gloves .
HELEN: Were you badly hurt ? I think we saw each other at the hospital . I do n't want the car . In fact , I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped .
JAMES: Can I give you a lift ? I somehow find myself driving again .
HELEN: Have n't I ? To the airport , if you could .
JAMES: The airport ? Why ? Are you leaving ?
HELEN: Not yet though not soon enough for some people , I 've already found . A death in the doctor 's family makes the patients doubly uneasy .
JAMES: I take it you 're not wearing white to reassure them .
HELEN: I 'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to .
JAMES: So why the airport ?
HELEN: I work in the immigration department there .
JAMES: Look at all this traffic . I 'm not sure I can deal with it .
HELEN: It 's much worse now . You noticed that , did you ? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I did n't understand . There seemed to e ten times as much traffic .
JAMES: Are we imagining it ?
HELEN: You 've bought yourself exactly the same car again . It 's the same shape and colour .
JAMES: The Road Research Laboratory ? Where they simulate car crashes ?
HELEN: Yes .
JAMES: Is n't that rather too close ?
HELEN: That 's the point . Besides , I know I can give something now that I was n't emotely aware of before . It 's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment .
RENATA: I almost forgot to give you this . Probably because I know you 're going to like it .
JAMES: What is it ?
RENATA: A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition . Definitely not part of the big auto show . There 's a map in the packet and a note equesting you be discreet about the location .
JAMES: Really ? What kind of exhibition is it ?
RENATA: I suspect it involves re-enactments of famous car crashes . You know , Jayne Mansfield , James Dean , Albert Camus
JAMES: You 're kidding .
RENATA: Serious . But you 'll have to take your new friend , the female crash- test dummy . She dropped it off fo you .
JAMES: You 're not jealous , are you ? You have to understand Helen and I had this strange , intense experience together .
RENATA: We 've had a few of those ourselves , have n't we ?
VAUGHAN: 'Do n't worry , that guy 's got ta see us ! ' These were the confident last words of the brilliant young Hollywood star James Dean as he piloted his Porsche 550 Spyder race car toward a date with death on a lonely stretch of California two-lane blacktop , Route 466 . 'Do n't worry , that guy 's got ta see us . ' The year , 1955 ; the day , September thirtieth ; the time now .
JAMES: It 's strange I thought all this would be far more popular . Helen is consulting a yellow program sheet .
HELEN: The real thing is available free of charge . Besides , it 's not quite legal . They ca n't advertise .
VAUGHAN: The first star of our show is 'Little Bastard ' , James Dean 's racing Porsche . He named it after himself , and had his racing number , 130 , painted on it .
JAMES: Who is that ? The announcer . Do I know him ?
HELEN: That 's Vaughan . He talked to you at the hospital .
JAMES: Oh , yes . I thought he was a medical photographer , doing some sort of accident research . He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash .
HELEN: When I first met Vaughan , he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems . I do n't know what he is now .
VAUGHAN: The second star is stuntman and forme ace driver Colin Seagrave , who will drive our replica of James Dean 's car .
JAMES: Is that part of the act or are they eally hurt ?
HELEN: I do n't know . You can never be sure with Vaughan . This is his show .
VAUGHAN: Rolf Wütherich was thrown from the Porsche and spent a year in the hospital recovering from his injuries . Donald Turnupseed was found wandering around in a daze , basically unhurt . James Dean died of a broken neck and ecame immortal .
COLIN: Hold me . I 'm dizzy . I ca n't stand up .
HELEN: I know that man , Seagrave , the stunt driver . I think he 's genuinely hurt .
POLICE: This is an illegal and unauthorized automotive demonstration which is in contravention of the Highway Traffic Act . You are all liable to fines and possible arrest and confinement Disperse at once ! Disperse at once !
HELEN: What 's the matter with Seagrave ?
VAUGHAN: Hit his head , I think . His balance is off .
JAMES: Why are the police taking this all so seriously ?
VAUGHAN: It 's not the police . It 's the Department of Transport . Internal politics . It 's a joke . They have no idea who we really are .
VERA: Oh , God . What happened ? Here , lie down .
HELEN: They did the James Dean crash . It seemed to go perfectly . But he started to feel nauseous on the way back . I 'm sure it 's concussion .
VERA: Ah , well We 're familiar enough with that , then , are n't we ?
VAUGHAN: I 'd really like to work out the details of the Jayne Mansfield crash with you . We could do the decapitation her head embedded in the windshield and the little dead dog thing as well . You know , the Chihuahuas in the back seat . I 've got it figured out .
COLIN: You know I 'll be ready , Vaughan . But I 'll want to wear really big tits out to here so the crowd can see them get cut up and crushed on the dashboard .
VAUGHAN: Do n't leave yet , Ballard . I want you to help me .
JAMES: Do you live here ? With Seagrave ?
VAUGHAN: I live in my car . This is my workshop .
JAMES: What kind of help can I possibly be to you ? You seem to be everywhere at once as it is .
GABRIELLE: Thought you might be missing these . So here you are at the nerve centre . Vaughan makes everything look like a crime , does n't he ?
JAMES: What exactly is your project , Vaughan ? A book of crashes ? A medical study ? A sensational documentary ? Global traffic ?
VAUGHAN: It 's something we 're all intimately involved in the reshaping of the human body by modern technology .
JAMES: Vaughan , what the hell are you doing ? Are you trying to create your own Famous Crash ? Vaughan hooks his gear lever into reverse .
VAUGHAN: It excited her , Ballard . Your wife , Catherine . She enjoyed it . Ask her .
CATHERINE: He must have fucked a lot of women in that huge car of his . It 's like a ed on wheels . It must smell of semen
JAMES: It does .
CATHERINE: Do you find him attractive ?
JAMES: He 's very pale . Covered with scars .
CATHERINE: Would you like to fuck him , though ? In that car ?
JAMES: No . But when he 's in that car
CATHERINE: Have you seen his penis ?
JAMES: I think it 's badly scarred too . From a motorcycle accident .
CATHERINE: Is he circumcised ? Can you imagine what his anus is like ? Describe it to me . Would you like to sodomize him ? Would you like to put your penis ight into his anus , thrust it up his anus ? Tell me , describe it to me . Tell me what you would do . How would you kiss him in that car ? Describe how you 'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans , then take out his penis . Would you kiss it o suck it right away ? Which hand would you hold it in ? Have you ever sucked a penis ? Do you know what semen tastes like ? Have you ever tasted semen ? Some semen is saltier than others . Vaughan 's semen must be very salty
HELEN: Have you come ?
JAMES: Please finish your story .
HELEN: The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital . Then the husband of a colleague of mine , then a trainee adiologist , then the service manage at my garage .
JAMES: And you had sex with all of these men in cars ? Only in cars ?
HELEN: Yes . I did n't plan it that way .
JAMES: And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts ? As though they were traffic accidents ?
HELEN: Yes . They felt like traffic accidents .
VAUGHAN: Get all the paper you can , Ballard . Some of the stuff they 're giving away is terrific 'Mechanisms of Occupant Ejection ' , 'Tolerances of the Human Face in Crash Impacts '
HELEN: We can have a look at it again on the monitors . They 're showing it in slow motion .
VAUGHAN: I 've always wanted to drive a crashed car .
JAMES: You could get your wish at any moment .
VAUGHAN: No , I mean a crash with a history . Camus 's Facel Vega , or Nathaniel West 's station wagon , Grace Kelly 's Rover 3500 . Fix it just enough to get it rolling . Do n't clean it , do n't touch anything else .
JAMES: Is that why you drive this car ? I take it that you see Kennedy 's assassination as a special kind of car crash ?
VAUGHAN: The case could be made .
JAMES: It 's very satisfying . I 'm not sure I understand why .
VAUGHAN: It 's the future , Ballard , and you 're already part of it . For the first time , a benevolent psychopathology eckons towards us . For example , the car crash is a fertilizing rathe than a destructive event a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form . To fully understand that , and to live that that is my project .
JAMES: What about the reshaping of the human ody by modern technology ? I thought that was your project .
VAUGHAN: A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and does n't threaten anybody . I use it to test the esilience of my potential partners in psychopathology .
RENATA: Your friend 's still out there .
JAMES: Hard to say .
RENATA: I 'm going to leave now . Do you want a lift ?
JAMES: No , thanks . I 'll go with Vaughan .
CATHERINE: They 're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport . Some pedestrian they think he was run over intentionally .
JAMES: Vaughan is n't interested in pedestrians .
CATHERINE: You 'd better drive him . He 's a bit shaky . I 'll follow in my car . Where is yours ?
JAMES: At home . I could n't face all this traffic .
CATHERINE: I 'd better come with you , then . Are you sure you can drive ?
VAUGHAN: It 's Seagrave . He was worried that we would never do Jayne Mansfield 's crash , now that the police were cracking down . So he did it himself .
JAMES: We must have driven through a pool of blood . If the police stop you again , they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed .
VAUGHAN: You 're right , Ballard . There 's an all-night car-wash in the airport service area .
SALESMAN: Is there something here that interests you ?
GABRIELLE: The white sports model . Could you help me into it , please ? I 'd like to see if I can fit into a car designed for a normal body .
AD: Somebody named Vaughan . Do you want it ?
JAMES: Hello ? Ballard .
VAUGHAN: I need to see you , Ballard . I need to talk to you about the project .
JAMES: Where are you ?
VAUGHAN: You 're making it too clean .
TATTOOIST: Medical tattoos are supposed to be clean .
VAUGHAN: This is n't a medical tattoo . This is a prophetic tattoo . Prophesy is dirty and ragged . Make it dirty and ragged .
TATTOOIST: Prophetic ? Is this personal prophesy or global prophesy ?
VAUGHAN: There 's no difference . James I want you to let her give you this one .
JAMES: Where do you think that one should go ?
VAUGHAN: It should go here .
JAMES: I thought that was you , up there .
CATHERINE: My last lesson 's next week . James my car
JAMES: What ? Tell me .
CATHERINE: I was n't driving . I 'd left the ca in the parking-lot at the airport . Could it have been deliberate ?
JAMES: One of your suitors ?
CATHERINE: One of my suitors .
JAMES: It 's Vaughan . He 's courting you . Let 's go find him .
CATHERINE: I 'd like to go back . James
JAMES: Not yet . It 's only beginning .
VERA: The police are after him . An American serviceman was killed on the Northolt overpass .
JAMES: I think he 'll be waiting for us at the airport .
CATHERINE: James James turns the car into the traffic .
JAMES: I 'd like to register a claim for the lack 1963 Lincoln , the one that came in a couple of days ago . Is there a form I can fill out ?
POUND OFFICER: There certainly is , but you 'll have to come back between 7 30 and 4 30 to get one . What 's your attachment to that thing ?
JAMES: A close friend owned it .
POUND OFFICER: Well , it 's got to be a total write- off . I do n't see what you could possibly do with it .
JAMES: Catherine . Are you all right ? Are you hurt ?
CATHERINE: James , I I do n't know I think I 'm all right
JAMES: Maybe the next one , darling Maybe the next one

HANNAH: Is that so ?
JACOB: It is . So now I 'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink . If you say yes , we 'll have one more cocktail each just enough to start losing inhibitions , not enough to get sloppy , after all I promised to satisfy you .
LIZ: Multiple times .

LETTY: Maybe .
RUTH: You always throw the best dinne parties , Letty .
LETTY: Oh , wait a minute , now I see where you 're going .
RUTH: Please , Letty .
LETTY: Mom and Dad ? At dinner together ? Are you crazy ?

LETTY: No , it 's not OK. You 'll never get to college on OK .
PAUL: What are you doing ? You 're going to be late .
LETTY: I 'm calling in sick .
PAUL: You do n't have a fever .
LETTY: I do n't feel like going to work today .
PAUL: Wo n't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late ?
LETTY: It 'll be OK .
PAUL: But what about that math project ?
LETTY: Paul , I just ca n't go . Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime ?

LETTY: Maybe .
PAUL: Let 's make a list of the things you need to do , OK ?
MRS. ANDERSON: So at home , we 've started our own little library for Chandra .
MR. ANDERSON: We thought it would be a good project for her to set up her own card-catalogue .
LETTY: I see .
MRS. ANDERSON: But what I 'm wondering is whethe we should also be spending more time on her computer skills at home . What do you think ?
LETTY: Well
MR. ANDERSON: Because we do n't want her to get ehind her classmates .
MRS. ANDERSON: And we trust your opinion . Chandra 's always talking about Miss Mayer .
LETTY: Oh .
MR. ANDERSON: Just the other day she came home and told us about you taking care of her bloody nose .
MRS. ANDERSON: And she went on and on about the collage . That seems very inventive , Miss Mayer .
MR. ANDERSON: Miss Mayer ?
LETTY: What the fuck . It 's my job .
CLERK: More coffee ?
LETTY: Hit me .
CLERK: Danish ?
LETTY: No more bear claws left ?

RUTH: Where 's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy ?
LETTY: She said she 'd be here at 10 .
RUTH: What do you think of this one ?
LETTY: I 'd have to see it on .
RUTH: Have you been crying ? Your eyes are all puffy .

RUTH: Really ?
LETTY: Truly .

MRS. MAYER: I do n't like the bias cut on that one .
RUTH: No more . I ca n't stand to try on one more dress .
MRS. MAYER: Letty , I think this would be eautiful on you .
LETTY: Oh no .
MRS. MAYER: Paul could pop the question at any time .
LETTY: Mom , please .
MRS. MAYER: Especially with a promotion in the offing .
RUTH: Go on , Letty . I want to see it on you .
LETTY: Do you think I should ?
RUTH: Yes , yes . It 'll be fun .

CLERK: I think they went over to the next shop to take a peek at shoes .
MRS. MAYER: I gather he 's late as usual .
LETTY: Can I get you a glass of champagne ?
MR. MAYER: How 've you been , Martha ?
LETTY: It 's mushroom-time , folks .
MR. MAYER: I like the touch of cilantro . It is cilantro , is n't it ?
LETTY: You can always call it , Dad .
LETTY: Ruth 's narrowed the dress hunt down to two , Dad .
MR. MAYER: Tell me about them .

PAUL: Yes .
MRS. MAYER: That might be nice .
MR. MAYER: As long as you have
LETTY: Puglia olives . Would I forget ? A round of martinis coming right up .
RUTH: How can I help ?
LETTY: Paul , can you hand me the olives ? Ruth , I need you to , what was it ?
RUTH: What about the souffle ? Has that gone in ?
LETTY: Yeah , I just put it in . But the squab , I think that needs to be asted .
PAUL: Kind of icy in there .
RUTH: Thank God we have alcohol .
LETTY: Fuck me .
RUTH: What 's the matter ?
PAUL: Letty ?
LETTY: Olives Aux Herbes De Provence . I got the wrong kind of olives .
RUTH: What 's all the dreck ?
LETTY: Sage , rosemary Les Herbes .
RUTH: It 'll be fine .
LETTY: No , no . They 've got to be Puglia olives , packed in a light brine with a flavor that does n't overpower the palate .
JAKE: What do you think of those Lakers ?
PAUL: What are you doing ?
LETTY: Can you loan me a 20 ?
PAUL: Sure . Why ?
LETTY: I 'm going to the store .
PAUL: I think you 're overreacting .
RUTH: Letty , dinner 's almost ready . The souffle
LETTY: I 'll be back before you can say souffle .
LETTY: I ca n't find martini olives . All you have are black .
STORE CLERK: Aisle 2A .
OLD LADY: Excuse me , Miss . I ca n't reach the cat food .
LETTY: They 're not there . I need the ones from Puglia .
STORE CLERK: Specialty foods . 7B .

MANAGER: I think you should go now .
LETTY: I need my olives .
MANAGER: It 's time to leave .
LETTY: Fucking olives . Fucking , fucking olives .
MANAGER: Call police . Now .
MICHAEL: Miss Mayer ? Miss Mayer ?
LETTY: Letty .
MICHAEL: First off , Letty , can you tell me where you are ?
LETTY: I answered these questions last night .
MICHAEL: I know this can be a real drag , but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night .
LETTY: Hillview Psychiatric Hospital .
MICHAEL: Great . Now , Letty , I 'd like you to emember three items . I 'm going to ask you to repeat them in just a few minutes . They are chair , cup and ball . Did you get that ?
LETTY: 85 .
MICHAEL: And 85 minus 6 ?
LETTY: 59 .
MICHAEL: It 's OK . It 's not a pass-fail kind of thing .
MICHAEL: Now the three things I asked you to emember .
LETTY: Chair , cup and ball .
MICHAEL: Terrific .
LETTY: No .
MICHAEL: What about patterns ? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks ? Or washing your hands ove and over again ?
LETTY: Sometimes my food , and my clothes , and my underwear .
MICHAEL: How do you sort itby lace and cotton ?
LETTY: By color .
MICHAEL: What if it 's got a pattern ?
LETTY: Is this really important ? Because I do n't think it 's a problem .
MICHAEL: I see . How long has it been since you 've done something you 've enjoyed , Letty ?
LETTY: A while , I guess .
MICHAEL: That must be really difficult .
DR. EMLEE: Hello , Letitia . I 'm Dr. Emlee , and I have some questions to ask you
LETTY: I did this already .
DR. EMLEE: It 's hospital policy
LETTY: To be interviewed every hour ?
DR. EMLEE: I 'm the only doctor making rounds this morning .
LETTY: Well , I do n't have hallucinations . Honest .
DR. EMLEE: This doctor , was he tall , with dark hair ?
LETTY: Yeah , and a dimple .
DR. EMLEE: I 'm afraid Lhe 's not a doctor .
LETTY: Psychologist , therapist , whatever .
DR. EMLEE: Patient .
LETTY: What ?
DR. EMLEE: Michael , the man who came to see you , is a patient .
LETTY: What kind of place is this ?
DR. EMLEE: I apologize for the inconvenience , ut I must ask you some
LETTY: I want to see my mothe immediately .
DR. EMLEE: We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you 've experienced .
LETTY: I do n't think you understand . I wo n't wait .
DR. EMLEE: You 'll have to . Your family agreed to the conditions not to see you when they admitted you to Hillview , Letitia . We can talk about how that makes you feel , but we ca n't change the ules .

LETTY: You know , my mom 's coming to get me tomorrow . I 'll be leaving .
NURSE GATES: It 's OK , Letty . I 'll be right here with you .
THOMAS: So I said to my publisher this afternoon , I said , do n't you even
NURSE GATES: Hi , gang . I want to introduce you to Letty . Letty , this is Mrs. Hallstrom and Marie , and John and Thomas .
THOMAS: Just discussing my pesky publisher . May I ask what you do when you 're not vacationing ?
MARIE: Let the poor girl get some food , for Heaven 's sake .
LETTY: I 'm a teacher .
THOMAS: As you may have gathered , I 'm a writer .
NURSE GATES: Excuse me for interrupting , Thomas , ut we really should get some food
MICHAEL: Now I 'm going to say that the card you picked was the Ace of Spades .
NURSE GATES: Michael .
LETTY: We 've met . I missed you during rounds this morning .
NURSE GATES: This doctor thing has got to stop .
LETTY: I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry .
MRS. MAYER: Oh , Letty , what happened ?
LETTY: Mom , I was there , and I just , I was so
MRS. MAYER: I 've talked to Doctor Emlee , and he says
LETTY: I 'm so glad to see you . You ca n't elieve the people in here . They 've got patients posing as doctors
MRS. MAYER: Everyone says it 's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing .
LETTY: I just want to go home . Can we go home now ?
MRS. MAYER: I think the best thing for you ight now is to stay here and get well .
LETTY: Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth , or Paul .
MRS. MAYER: We all agree with the doctor , Dear . He thinks it 's safer for you to stay here for a while .
LETTY: You all really think I need to be here ?
MRS. MAYER: Yes .
LETTY: But what about Beast ? Who 'll ?
MRS. MAYER: Ruth 's already taken him home .
LETTY: And my class . It 'll be hard to find a good substitute . And what about my math program ?
MRS. MAYER: Paul said he 'd call the school . And your father thinks he 's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help .
LETTY: Charges ?
MRS. MAYER: For his injuries . I guess youI guess he got hit in the head .
LETTY: Mom , no , please do n't go . Please .
MRS. MAYER: I 'll see you soon .
LETTY: Tomorrow ?
MRS. MAYER: As soon as Dr. Emlee says .
MARIE: Especially the OCD .
MICHAEL: Hey there . They 're showing `` Groundhog Day '' if you
LETTY: You took bets on my diagnosis ?
MICHAEL: It 's no big deal . We all compare .
MICHAEL: Do n't take it personally .
LETTY: You have no right , no right to take the worst thing that 's eve happened to me and make it into some kind of game .
MICHAEL: Stop acting like you 're someone special . You 're just like the rest of us .
LETTY: I 'm not the one who 's masquerading as a doctor . I 'm not the one who 's , who 's
JOHN: He 's schizophrenic .
LETTY: I 'm not the one who 's schizophrenic . I do n't see people who are n't there or run around acting crazy .
PATIENTS: Go , Girl ! / Come on , Michael .
MICHAEL: Oh , no , you 're perfectly sane . That 's why you 're here .
LETTY: Go fuck yourself .
PATIENTS: Bravo./Encore./Re-match .
MRS. HALLSTROM: I ca n't stop thinking about the things I did wrong when my daughte was little .
DR. EMLEE: And how 's that make you feel ?
MRS. HALLSTROM: I just feel like sleeping . All the time .
THOMAS: Hell 's bells , you can count me in on that . I have n't had enough Z 's since I ran those sleep disorde experiments at Stanford back in the 70s .
MARIE: We really miss doing things with you , Mrs. Hallstrom .
MRS. HALLSTROM: Maybe when I hit my manic phase again .
JOHN: I 've noticed Letty does n't much like to do things with us .
LETTY: Oh , no . Of course I do .
JOHN: Then why are you so defensive ?
MICHAEL: I do n't think we need to sacrifice Letty to pep up a slow session .
JOHN: You 're the one who told everyone about her panties .
DR. EMLEE: Maybe you 'd like to share some of your feelings about OCD o depression with us , Letty .
LETTY: Do we have to talk about this ?
DR. EMLEE: I think in the spirit of group therapy , it 's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others .
LETTY: Excuse me ?
MICHAEL: What are you looking to read ?
LETTY: Anything interesting .
MICHAEL: This is good .
LETTY: But you 're checking it out .
MICHAEL: I 've already checked it out 17 times .
LETTY: You keep the book . I 'm looking fo Emily Dickinson .
MICHAEL: Hey , if you take the magic book , I 'll feel like maybe you accept my apology and do n't hate me anymore .
LETTY: I have n't heard an apology .
MICHAEL: I 'm really sorry I hurt you feelings . I got a little carried away . Can you ever forgive me ?
PAUL: It 's prettier here than I thought it would be .
LETTY: Yeah , I guess it 's all right .
PAUL: Are you all right ?
LETTY: That 's a big question .
PAUL: I hope it was n't something I did .
LETTY: Something you did ?
PAUL: That put you in here .
LETTY: Of course not , no . Is that why you 're here ?
PAUL: I think we need to talk about some things .
LETTY: Yes , I suppose so .
PAUL: This has been really difficult , this whole thing .
LETTY: No .
PAUL: Especially this last year .
LETTY: Especially now .
PAUL: So , I 've been thinking a lot
LETTY: I have too , Paul .
PAUL: I talked to Ruth a little bit , and I think it 's about time
LETTY: I know . We ca n't just keep going through the motions .
PAUL: Exactly . It 's time to make decisions .
LETTY: You do n't have to say anything else . I 've known for a while that this was coming .
PAUL: I just wish we 'd done it sooner .
LETTY: Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients .
PAUL: I hope you like it . It 's a Marquis cut , 1.5 carats . They had one with emeralds around it , but this was simpler , more classic in its lines .
LETTY: It 's , it 's really nice , Paul .
PAUL: You can take it back and we can have one custom made if you want .
LETTY: No , you 've done a perfect job .
PAUL: So , what do you say , Let ?
LETTY: Do you think , really , that it 's OK to get engaged when I 'm in here ?
PAUL: Sure . We 'll save the formal announcement for when you 're out . I already told your mother . I hope you do n't mind .
LETTY: No , no .
PAUL: So will you ?
LETTY: Of course . Yes . I will . I do .
MICHAEL: You missed out on some great occoli florets at dinner .
LETTY: I was n't hungry .
MICHAEL: John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom 's milk .
LETTY: Finally . I was getting tired of watching him try every night .
MICHAEL: Was it bad newsthe visit from Peter ?
LETTY: Paul .
MICHAEL: He looked pretty serious .
LETTY: He asked me to marry him .
MICHAEL: Very romantic setting .
LETTY: It was romantic . He 's very omantic .
MICHAEL: So are you engaged , or what ?
LETTY: What have you done with the ring ?
MICHAEL: It 's magic .
LETTY: This is n't funny . Paul would kill me .
MICHAEL: Guess which hand .
LETTY: Enough with the abracadabra .
MICHAEL: Guess .
LETTY: T he left one .
MICHAEL: The fair maiden guesses incorrectly . Should we give he one more try ? The audience says one more try . What guess you now ?
LETTY: The right one .
MICHAEL: With this ring , I thee
LETTY: Really , this is n't funny .
MICHAEL: OK , OK , I 'll give it back .
LETTY: Good God .
MICHAEL: A small price .
LETTY: I wo n't do your portion of kitchen cleanup .
MICHAEL: No .
LETTY: And I 'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos .
MICHAEL: I want a kiss .
LETTY: Get serious .
MICHAEL: I 'm serious .
LETTY: Everything 's a joke with you .
MICHAEL: Here .
LETTY: The medicine 's still bothering me . It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain .
DR. EMLEE: We 'll see about adjusting the dosage if that does n't clear in the next How are other things going ?
LETTY: I think I 've told you all the news . Let 's seethe engagement . Oh , and my sister 's coming to visit me , and they say my cat misses me .
DR. EMLEE: The question , Letty , is how are you feeling ?
LETTY: I miss Beast a lot , too .
NURSE GATES: What are you doing ?
MICHAEL: Not me .
MRS. HALLSTROM: Sorry , sorry . Candy canes are out of season .
NURSE GATES: Mrs. Hallstrom ?
MARIE: Hot boxers .
LETTY: I ca n't believe you finally gave me the shirt .
RUTH: Loaned you . And it 's only 'til you get out of here .
LETTY: That settles it . I 'm never leaving .
RUTH: I can hardly wait 'til you 're free . Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster .
LETTY: You 're slowing .
RUTH: Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white .
LETTY: Ecru .
RUTH: And then the gold scroll or the lack Romanesque print ?
LETTY: Do we have to talk wedding details ?
RUTH: Oh , no , of course not .
LETTY: I mean , you can always send me fabric samples to look at o pictures of dresses . But , it 's een so long since we 've seen each other .
RUTH: Of course . You 're right . Besides , we should be talking about you engagement .
LETTY: Tell me more about Beast beating up that other cat .
RUTH: Bloody furry mess , like I said . Are n't you so excited about Paul ?
LETTY: Ruthie , do you ever wonder if you 'll meet someone elsesomeone esides Jake ?
RUTH: What 's his name , Letty ?
LETTY: I did n't say
RUTH: Do n't even try . What 's his name ?
NURSE GATES: Lights out , Letty .
LETTY: We 're supposed to be asleep .
MICHAEL: Exactly .
LETTY: We 'll get caught .
MICHAEL: No rounds for another three hours .
MICHAEL: Rendezvous at the closet in 30 .
NURSE GATES: Letty , you should be in bed .
LETTY: There 's a spider in my room .
NURSE GATES: Yeah ?
LETTY: It 's got a green dot on its back . I ca n't go to sleep with it watching me .
NURSE GATES: Sounds awful . I guess we bette check it out .
MICHAEL: Extra large pepperoni and mushrooms . And two cokes . Hillview Psychiatric Hospital on Glenfield . Off the Fourth Street exit .
LETTY: It had this red spot on its back .
NURSE GATES: Green spot .
LETTY: Mottled really . Green and red .
NURSE GATES: I do n't know why you feel you have to lie , Letty .
LETTY: Lie ?
NURSE GATES: If you feel lonely , or need to talk , all you have to do is say so .
LETTY: To talk ? Well , OK , that might be good .
JIM: I 'm afraid I ca n't let you take that in without the proper invoice .
MICHAEL: It 's a pizza .
JIM: All the same , rules are rules .
MICHAEL: You do n't understand . This is a very important , very special , morale-boosting pizza .
JIM: What I understand is how low morale gets when you 're posted at a guard station all night , Val .
LETTY: I do n't mean to go on and on like this .
NURSE GATES: It 's OK . It 's good to let it out .
LETTY: He was graduating from law school , and he just assumed I was OK with dropping out . We never really talked about it . But I know he was disappointed in me .
NURSE GATES: You can only do what feels best to you now .
LETTY: I guess so . I think that 's right .
NURSE GATES: I 'm glad .
LETTY: And if I need to talk again
NURSE GATES: Yes , of course . Whenever you want .
LETTY: Sorry I 'm late
MICHAEL: Shhh .
MICHAEL: How 's it look ?
MRS. HALLSTROM: Shhh . They 're coming to the cubic zirconium .
MICHAEL: I like those sapphire earrings myself .
MRS. HALLSTROM: S imulated sapphires . I bet my daughter would love those , too .
MARIE: Jesusjust get a room .
DR. EMLEE: I think it 's a problem that you never told me about Michael . I had to hear it from another patient .
LETTY: I could n't really say anything ecause of that fraternizing rule .
DR. EMLEE: Well , Letty , this does present a liability issue for the hospital .
LETTY: I 'm a grown woman , Dr. Emlee . I can take care of myself .
LETTY: I know Michael 's a schizophrenic , and Mrs. Hallstrom 's manic- depressive , and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis , and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur .
DR. EMLEE: Go ahead and put the guard back up , Letty . But you need to know what you 're dealing with .
LETTY: I do n't need a lecture . I care about Michael .
DR. EMLEE: Then that 's even more reason to listen . Look , schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality . They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes .
LETTY: Look , I know he 's almost through with treatment here . And , he 's on medication .
DR. EMLEE: Drugs can help suppress symptoms . But lots of patients stop taking them when they 're on their own ecause the side effects are so harsh . And , Michael 's condition is often worsened by periods of stress . He 's een in and out of
LETTY: I do n't want to hear anymore .
DR. EMLEE: I 'd like you to promise you wo n't carry on a relationship with Michael . Otherwise , I 'll conside moving one of you to another ward .
LETTY: First you tell me to do what I want to , then you tell me to stop .
DR. EMLEE: All I want you to do is think about what 's best for you . Really think about it .
MICHAEL: A daisy for the lady .
LETTY: The lady knows this is a dandelion .
MICHAEL: A rose is a rose .
LETTY: Thanks . Where 've you been all day ?
MICHAEL: Back-to-back sessions with the shrink .
LETTY: Sounds important .
MICHAEL: I 'm not allowed to see you anymore .
LETTY: Really ? Me too .
MICHAEL: I had to sneak by the guards to get here . They say you 're highly unstable , have a depressive personality , and may hold back my own recovery .
LETTY: Wow . I 'm bad news .
MICHAEL: What 's my rap ?
LETTY: Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions .
MICHAEL: Fuck . That 's all true .
LETTY: What are the delusions like ?
MICHAEL: I think people are after me , crap like that .
MICHAEL: Shocking , huh ?
LETTY: Sure . But I took out a whole grocery store .
MICHAEL: I wish I could have seen that .
LETTY: I 'm starting to think that everyone 's crazy to some extent .
MICHAEL: M y Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil , and they grow right up to the sun , tall and straight . Other trees , they start as seeds in the crevices etween rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light . But even though they end up crooked , they 're still trees , just like the straight ones .
LETTY: Break up ? They wish .
DELIVERY MAN: I need a signature , please .
NURSE GATES: What is all this stuff ?
DELIVERY MAN: I just deliver it , Ma'am .
NURSE GATES: Well , who exactly is it for ?
DELIVERY MAN: A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom .
NURSE GATES: I see . Can you wait a moment ?
DR. EMLEE: But how does that make you feel , John , what Letty said about you hostility ?
JOHN: She does n't know what the hell she 's talking about .
NURSE GATES: I 'm sorry , Doctor . I just need a moment with Mrs. Hallstrom .
DR. EMLEE: What seems to be the problem ?
NURSE GATES: They say she orderedMrs . Hallstrom , did you order a bunch of stuff , because Federal Express
MRS. HALLSTROM: It 's here , everyone . Come along . It 's here .
DR. EMLEE: Oh , fine , let 's see .
MRS. HALLSTROM: For you , John . And , Letty . And , Michael , I know you 'll love these .
DR. EMLEE: Mrs. Hallstrom , you ordered all this ?
JOHN: Thomas got a crown and all I got was a lousy bracelet ?
DR. EMLEE: You must have spent thousands of dollars .
MRS. HALLSTROM: Do n't worry , Doctor , I did n't forget you .
DR. EMLEE: Mrs. Hallstrom , you ca n't possibly afford to pay for this . It must go ack .
MRS. HALLSTROM: Why , no , Doctor . It ca n't . Most of it 's for my daughter , Lily . She 's coming to family day tomorrowall the way from Cleveland with my grandson . You ca n't be taking away thei `` Welcome to California '' presents .
DR. EMLEE: It 's going back . We 'll contact the company this afternoon . Take the jewelry off , please .
RS. HALLSTROM: But I have to keep something for my daughter .
DR. EMLEE: Let 's go back to group , and discuss it there . Back to group , everyone .
NURSE GATES: Your mother 's in the rec room , Letty .
MRS. MAYER: It 's so good to see you , Sweetheart .
LETTY: You too , Mom .
MRS. MAYER: You 're looking good . A little thin , but good .
LETTY: Which flowers did you order ?
MRS. MAYER: We have n't . I wanted to talk that over with you , too .
LETTY: Oh , OK , well , better to choose the table cloths first anyway .
MRS. MAYER: I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask .
LETTY: This would complement the blue in the bride 's maids ' dresses . Look .
MRS. MAYER: Where 's your ring , Sweetheart ?
LETTY: We are n't allowed to wear jewelry in here , Mom .
MRS. MAYER: Just think , pretty soon , we 'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you . Of course , if that 's what you still want . Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here .
LETTY: I have n't had a crush since I was
MRS. MAYER: When did you start smoking ?
LETTY: I 'll put it out if it bothers you .
MRS. MAYER: The puckering , dear . It does n't seem so now , but in time , it will cause wrinkles around the mouth .
LETTY: What ?
MRS. MAYER: I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic .
LETTY: Mom , please .
MRS. MAYER: Do n't forget that Paul 's a promising young attorney who loves you very much
LETTY: Mom , look , if I want to dump Paul , I 'll dump him . If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him , then I 'll do that .
MRS. MAYER: I 'm only looking out for you .
LETTY: And if I want to smoke , I 'll fucking smoke .
THOMAS: Mrs. Mayer , I 'm sorry but I could n't help overhearing . I just wanted to say , not that it 's any of my business
MRS. MAYER: Yes ?
THOMAS: I think , really , I think I 'd go with the cream damask .
NURSE GATES: It 's OK to be upset .
MRS. HALLSTROM: Upset ? Why of course not . My goodness , no . I 'm sure she just got hung up .
MICHAEL: Mrs. Hallstrom , why do n't you join my family for dinner . You 'll love my Grandma Rosa .
MRS. HALLSTROM: That 's so sweet , Michael . But , eally , I 've so many things to do .
LETTY: If you change your mind , we 'll be in the dining hall .
ROSA: What do you need now ? Send down the lamb . This girl 's as thin as a stick .
LETTY: Oh , no . I 'm stuffed .
ROSA: Tell her to eat , Frank .
MR. SANTUCCI: Mangia . Mangia .
MICHAEL: You ca n't turn down Grandma Rosa 's lamb .
ROSA: Or my eggplant . I make the best eggplant in L.A . The mozzarella I use , it 's so fresh it sweats .
MRS. SANTUCCI: Michael says you 're a teacher .
LETTY: I was . I 'm hoping I 'll still have a job when I get out .
MRS. HALLSTROM: Rosa , Rosa , you must have this , Rosa .
ROSA: Grazie .
MICHAEL: Mrs. Hallstrom , join us . Please .
MRS. HALLSTROM: Merry Christmas to all . Ho , ho , ho , ho .
LETTY: Michael , we 've got to stop her .
MRS. HALLSTROM: My goodness , it 's so very warm in here . So warm .
MICHAEL: You must have thought about it . Everyone does .
LETTY: I just want to see Beast . Where would you go ?
MICHAEL: The mission up in Santa Barbara .
LETTY: No way .
MICHAEL: That 's where I always go when I get out .
LETTY: Why ?
MICHAEL: My dad used to take me there when I was little . It 's totally quiet . And you can see the ocean fo miles .
LETTY: What else would you do ?
MICHAEL: I 'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together . And we 'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper .
LETTY: And we 'd eat Spaghetti-O 's in bed from the can .
MICHAEL: How can you even mention Spaghetti- O 's after eating Grandma Rosa 's dinner tonight ?
LETTY: I have a terrible confession .
MICHAEL: Tell the doctor .
LETTY: I do n't like lamb .
MICHAEL: Then it 's over .
LETTY: Lie down .
MICHAEL: It 's a good thing my family loves you .
LETTY: Your family just met me .
MICHAEL: You 're right . I guess I was projecting . What I should have said is , `` It 's a good thing I love you . ''
LETTY: Do you ?
MICHAEL: I do .
LETTY: Michael , I
MICHAEL: It 's OK. You do n't have to say anything .
LETTY: But I do . I love you , too .
MICHAEL: Your Honor , I feel I should be eleased . I 'm sufficiently able to look after
LETTY: John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you .
MICHAEL: Oh , right . I 'm ready . How do I look ?
LETTY: Great . I came to tell you to break a leg , and to give you this fo good luck .
JUDGE MILTON: Why have you petitioned to leave the institution ?

JUDGE MILTON: Is your mother here today ?
JOHN: That 's the bitch . That cock- sucking bitch . She put me here . She did . She 's the Satan that did this all .
JUDGE MILTON: The records indicate no majo episodes in the past four months . And it seems you have the support of the staff .
MICHAEL: Yes , Sir .
JUDGE MILTON: But I see you 've been in and out of the hospital more than ten times .
MICHAEL: Eleven , Your Honor . But I 'm on a new medication now .
JUDGE MILTON: Do you feel ready to re-enter the world ?
MICHAEL: Yes , Sir . My family is prepared to support me until I find a job . They 've already located an apartment for me that 's very nea them .
JUDGE MILTON: Very well , then . By order of the court , you are released . I wish you good luck .
PAUL: What 's so urgent ? You 've got me worried .
LETTY: I need to tell you something , and I 'm not sure how .
PAUL: You can tell me anything . Do you want to postpone the wedding ? Is it too much pressure ?
LETTY: No
PAUL: That 's a load off my mind .
LETTY: Paul , I want to break off the engagement .
LETTY: I do n't mean to hurt you . I know this is a terrible thing . And I have really loved you .
PAUL: Whoa . Whoa . Have really loved me ? Letty , it 's natural to be nervous . But we 're going to work through ou problems .
LETTY: I 've met someone else .
PAUL: Who ?
LETTY: It does n't matter who .
PAUL: Have you been seeing anothe teacher ?
LETTY: No .
PAUL: It 's a doctor , is n't it ? That 's unethical . I 'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin .
LETTY: He 's a patient here .
PAUL: Of all the crazy things . I understood when you dropped out of law school . And during this whole mess , I 've tried to be supportive . But , really , Letty , what can you be thinking ?
LETTY: I love him .
PAUL: You 're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love ?
LETTY: Here 's the ring .
PAUL: No way . You keep the ring . You 'll come to your senses .
LETTY: I 've made my decision , Paul .
PAUL: You keep it , Letty . This is not over . Our life is not over .

LETTY: Well ? M

MICHAEL: No , you goof , I came to see you .
LETTY: Just checking .

LETTY: Yeah .
MICHAEL: So , it 's over ?
LETTY: All over . Did you see your new apartment ?
MICHAEL: One bedroom , second floor , no view .

LETTY: List schmist . You 'll remember .
THOMAS: Hit me .
NURSE GATES: Dr. Stone will ask you some questions , and then we 'll get you settled .

LETTY: It 's going to be a difficult few weeks for him .
THOMAS: It really makes you think .
LETTY: It really does .
MARIE: I 'll put in 5 that it 's a straight diagnosis of depressive personality .
LETTY: Are you kidding ? With those glazed eyes ? I 'm willing to bet 10 there was some break with reality going on there . Psychosis . Without a doubt , psychosis .
DR. EMLEE: Have you been in contact with the principal about your job ?
LETTY: I thought about calling , but I want to wait until I know when I 'll be out .
DR. EMLEE: Then , you should call .
LETTY: What ?
DR. EMLEE: I think it 's about that time , Letty . The charges against you have been dropped , the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well .
LETTY: Are you saying I 'm through with therapy ?
DR. EMLEE: Let 's not be hasty . I 'm saying we should plan a release date for early next week .
MRS. MAYER: Must you walk so quickly ?
LETTY: It 's good exercise , Mom .
MRS. MAYER: I 've got 26 years on you . If we could just slow down , we could talk so much easier .
LETTY: I 've already made arrangements .
MRS. MAYER: Ruthie mentioned that Michael might e coming for you .
LETTY: Mom , we agreed . You can visit , but you 're not allowed to mention Michael .
MRS. MAYER: Not even if it 's something positive ?
LETTY: Nyet . That 's the condition .
MRS. MAYER: Have you spoken to Paul at all ?
LETTY: One more and you 're out .
MRS. MAYER: Honestly , Letty .
LETTY: A deal 's a deal .
MRS. MAYER: Have you heard the figure on how much Queen Elizabeth 's going to pay in taxes this year ?
LETTY: I knew you had it in you .
DR. EMLEE: So , we 'll meet every Tuesday and Friday . And if you have any kind of emergency , you can page me .
LETTY: OK , good . That 's good . Thanks an awful lot for everything , and fo coming down here to see me off .
DR. EMLEE: It was just a little going-away gesture .

LETTY: I love the pillows .
MICHAEL: Throw pillows , Letty . The sales lady said they 're the latest thing .
LETTY: Very trendy . Let 's see the rest .
MICHAEL: I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch . Now we can watch two shows at once .
LETTY: Let 's try out the bed .
MICHAEL: You 've got to see the kitchen first .
LETTY: I love your apartment .
MICHAEL: Really ?
LETTY: You 'll never get rid of me .
MICHAEL: Out ? Are you kidding ? I 've got all the fixings here .
LETTY: How can you not like the Top 10 List ?
MICHAEL: I like it . But Headlines are etter .
LETTY: You 're so wrong .
MICHAEL: Hey .
LETTY: It 's sex time .
MICHAEL: I think it 's my turn .
LETTY: Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face ?
MICHAEL: No .
LETTY: Michael .

MICHAEL: You 've got one hell of a great ody .
PRINCIPAL GAIL: I did n't have any choice but to include the parents ' letters in your file .
LETTY: Well , I understand . I know my ehavior was poor .
PRINCIPAL GAIL: So , in light of how the parents feel , and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute , I do n't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet .
LETTY: Look , Gail , I 've been a good teacher .
PRINCIPAL GAIL: I know , Letty . But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children . Now if you 'd come to me , explained what was going on
LETTY: Believe me , I wish I 'd understood what was going on . I 've worked eally hard to get better .
RINCIPAL GAIL: I 'm glad you 're doing well .
LETTY: I 've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was .
PRINCIPAL GAIL: It 's a very nice letter . But I have to go with what 's best for the students .
LETTY: What does that mean ?
PRINCIPAL GAIL: I need someone to work on budget projections .
LETTY: Office work ?
PRINCIPAL GAIL: Or , of course , you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year .
MR. SMYTHE: It 's not that we 're doubting you intelligence , Mr. Santucci . But your work history shows so many interruptions .
MICHAEL: I know , but as I said
MR. SMYTHE: I appreciate your candor about you illness , but my bosses are concerned .
MICHAEL: I can do the job .
MR. SMYTHE: Between you and me , my uncle , he has some mental problems , and I know what you 're going through . If it were up to me , I 'd hire you .
MICHAEL: Right . Thanks for your help .
LETTY: It 's open .
MICHAEL: Gosh , Letty , this is a great place .
LETTY: Thanks .
LETTY: That 's Mr . Beast to you .
MICHAEL: How was your day ?

LETTY: Yeah . How was the job search ?
MICHAEL: It does n't matter . It 'll work out .

LADY ONE: I ca n't believe he did that .
LADY TWO: What a weirdo .
MICHAEL: Do n't ever talk about me again , you hear me ?

LETTY: How 'd it go ?
MICHAEL: Four interviews . Four no-gos .
LETTY: The restaurant , too ?
MICHAEL: I could n't even face that one .
LETTY: That 's OK. We can call and eschedule in the morning .
MICHAEL: You do n't have to take care of me , you know .
MRS. SANTUCCI: Maybe we should save the job talk for after dinner .
MICHAEL: Just promise you 'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap .
LETTY: I think you know I 'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap .
MICHAEL: Coming .
LETTY: I think I could get the program up and running in the next two weeks .
JOHANSEN: From what I understand the principal has removed you from student activities .
LETTY: She 's worried that I 'm unstable .

LETTY: I 'd have to do that , too . But I 've gotten better at pacing myself .
JOHANSEN: Are you sure ?
LETTY: I 'll call you if I have problems . Scout 's honor .
JOHANSEN: I have to say I 'm inclined to give it another try .
MICHAEL: Hey , Letty . Mrs. Mayer .

MRS. MAYER: I will , Dear . I promise . Why McDonald 's ?
LETTY: He 's been looking everywhere fo weeks , Mom . It 's not that easy after you 've been locked away .
MRS. MAYER: I 've read that lots of people my age are supplementing their incomes these days by working at McDonald 's and Burger King .
LETTY: I 'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded .
MRS. MAYER: Do n't be fresh .
LETTY: Just remember that I love him .
MRS. MAYER: I 'll say this , Dear . He looks damn good in a tuxedo .
MICHAEL: Aunt Lily is the one who married your father 's cousin ?
LETTY: No , that 's Aunt Connie . Lily is the one who looks like a hooker .
MICHAEL: Oh . And , Harry , he 's the one who likes magic ?
LETTY: You do n't have to know all this by Saturday . It took me years .
AUNT LILY: What a beautiful wedding .
MICHAEL: Aunt Lily ?
LETTY: Bingo .
MRS. MAYER: Oh , and have you met Michael ? He 's Letty 's boyfriend .
RUTH: The worst was when I stammered Jake 's name .
LETTY: I do n't think people even noticed . I thought the ceremony was perfect .
RUTH: That 's thanks to all your help .
LETTY: Uh oh , Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock .
RUTH: Sorry to do this to you . But I am the bride .

LETTY: That 's fine , Uncle Cort .
CORT: So you were a volunteer over at the hospital ?
MICHAEL: Something like that .
LETTY: When he could get time off from the estaurant business .
MICHAEL: How about a dance ?
CORT: You two go ahead . I 'm going to go other that pretty sister of yours for a dance .
LETTY: Bye , Uncle Cort . What 's with the lie ?
MICHAEL: It was n't exactly a lie .
LETTY: Pretty close .
MICHAEL: People at weddings do n't want the truth .
LETTY: It 's not good to drink so much with the medication you 're on .
MICHAEL: What 's with this music ? I 'll go talk to the D.J . and see if we ca n't get something good going .
MR. MAYER: It 's good to see you so happy .
LETTY: Thanks , dad .
LETTY: Michael ? Michael ? You should come to bed .
MICHAEL: Always the drugs .

LETTY: Getting back .
PAUL: I heard about your friend .
LETTY: What ?
PAUL: I heard your friend was back in the hospital .
LETTY: Michael . Yes .
PAUL: I just wondered , well , if this meant there was a chance for us . Because I think about you a lot , and I still feel
LETTY: Our relationship meant a lot to me , too , Paul . But it 's over . And Michael being in the hospital does n't really change things .
PAUL: I think I 've heard this speech efore .
LETTY: I 'm really sorry .
LETTY: Sure , I understand .
NURSE GATES: He 's in Jamie 's old room .
LETTY: Hi .
MICHAEL: Hey .
LETTY: I guess we need to talk .
MICHAEL: I guess so .
LETTY: It 's hard to know where to start .
MICHAEL: Pretend like I 'm your shrink .
LETTY: I think about you all the time .
MICHAEL: I sure know what that feels like .
LETTY: And all the plans we have .
MICHAEL: Yeah , the plans .
LETTY: I 've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work , and then there 'd be more time on weekends to see

MICHAEL: Like I 've told you before I do n't want you taking care of me .
LETTY: Someone has to take care of you ight now , Michael . You tore up the apartment . You stopped taking your medications .

LETTY: I 'm sorry . I did n't come here to lame you .
MICHAEL: I did n't mean for any of this to happen .

MICHAEL: I know . I ca n't either .
LETTY: I love you so much .
MICHAEL: I love you too , Letty . I love you , too .
LETTY: Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach .
MICHAEL: That 's the best idea I 've heard in a long time .
LETTY: Do n't you have a magic trick o something to make this easier ?
MICHAEL: How about something better ? Like a kiss .
LETTY: I can still come visit you , you know .
MICHAEL: Would that really be such a good idea for either of us ?
LETTY: Just promise me you 'll be OK , OK ?
MICHAEL: I will . And you make sure you take care of yourself .
LETTY: I guess I should go now .
MICHAEL: You should go .
LETTY: First of all , I want to welcome you to MathShop . I have lots of fun games planned for us . Let 's see , Bobby , can you help me pass out these cards ?
BOBBY: Why were you gone so long ?
JENNY: My mom said you went crazy .

DARWIN: No . It is only a beam of light .
ANNIE: How can light make a picture .
DARWIN: Well they prepare a copper plate with chemicals on it . The chemicals are sort of energized y the light reflecting off you face . Then silver sticks onto the plate according to where the light is ightest .
ANNIE: Betty was worried it would hurt . .What a little duck she is .
DARWIN: So as I was saying , Captain Fitzroy went ashore to interview the Fuegans .

TECHNICIAN: Very still now . No more talking please
LENNY: Mama mama .
EMMA: Yes . What is it
LENNY: Horace says he 's six feet tall .
EMMA: Have you all washed your hands .
HORACE: He said I have to be or I ca n't join the army .
EMMA: First things first . An office must always tuck his shirt in .
BETTY: The boys made a camp with a camp- fire
LENNY: Oh ! Sneak !
EMMA: Where 's the campfire .
BETTY: In the summer house but Brodie put it out . Parslow enters with the turreen
EMMA: Thank-you Parslow . Where is M Darwin ?
PARSLOW: He was killing pigeons Ma'am
EMMA: Will everybody sit down please .
PARSLOW: Soup du jour , si

DARWIN: He wo n't stay long .
EMMA: Did he say what it was about ?
DARWIN: I think this is not the time to discuss it .
EMMA: Maybe the time to discuss it was efore you invited him .
DARWIN: He sent a telegram . I 'm sorry if it inconveniences you .
EMMA: Eat your soup now .
DARWIN: Tell Mr Davies it was delicious , ut my stomach is not quite right yet . Excuse me .
CHILDREN: Can we take Mr Hooker to the Chalk pits . Why ca n't he stay . Can we pick blackberries ?
EMMA: I think he is just here to work
ANNIE: Are n't you going to open it ?
DARWIN: Maybe best if I just burn the whole lot .
ANNIE: No papa - You ca n't . I 'm in it .
DARWIN: Do n't be absurd . Of course you 're not .
ANNIE: The story of me when I was small . You showed me the pages .
DARWIN: Ah yes .
ANNIE: `` The natural History of babies '' Remember ?
DARWIN: Of course I remember .
EMMA: What are you doing ?
DARWIN: Just playing .
EMMA: `` Six weeks Gurgles . Holds tight to my finger . Tries to suck . Smiles at my smile '' The baby lets out a long yodel of pleasure
DARWIN: I should add that she is musical .
EMMA: I hope you do not plan to treat all our children as little animacules to be included in you experiments .
DARWIN: Do you mean there will be more .
EMMA: I assumed that 's what you wanted . Of course , if the idea does n't appeal then
DARWIN: Appeal ? Dearest cousin . I am making plans for an army !
BRODIE: Careful ! Not too far ahead now .
HOOKER: Give it time to take a bite . The fishing float moves a little
ANNIE: I 've got one .
MR INNES: A leaf I should think . What plant did you find him on ?
ANNIE: In the mud under that log . Innes looks to Darwin for advice
MR INNES: Or a piece of bark maybe . Darwin peers at the insect
DARWIN: Cycrus caraboides . You can see from the mandibles he 's a hunter . He feeds on slugs and snails .
INNES: Oh . Annie runs off , calling to the other children
ANNIE: Etty ! Willy ! Find me some slugs . He 's hungry !
INNES: When I said I knew something of insects..
DARWIN: Oh tush . I studied Theology for a year but yet I know exceedingly little of the bible .
INNES: Then once I am properly installed at Down I shall take pleasure in instructing you .
DARWIN: I should look forward to that immensely .
HOOKER: Everyone 's a bit wet . Sorry , but the fish are surely biting . More worms , boys , more worms . George is looking under stones
DARWIN: .so much beauty for so little purpose .
EMMA: Surely not without purpose . They were helping to light the ship 's way were they not . Darwin smiles at the idea , turns to Innes
DARWIN: Are you familiar with the works of Thomas Malthus , Mr Innes ? .
INNES: He married his first cousin did n't he ?
EMMA: So did Charles . So did I .
INNES: Oh , I was not at all suggesting . Emma waves it away . Just teasing
DARWIN: He made the point that if every trout , say , has a hundred offspring And so on and so on through the generations . Then the planet would be knee deep in trout in just a few decades .
INNES: Of course most of the eggs are destroyed and eaten so the numbers remain stable . That is the beauty of God 's plan .
EMMA: Cheese and cucumbe
INNES: Thank-you
DARWIN: It does n't strike you as an exceedingly wasteful plan - these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished .
EMMA: Charles .
INNES: They are providing food fo others .
DARWIN: You think they are happy about it ?
INNES: Happy ?
HOOKER: Through his bottom and up though his mouth - perfect
DARWIN: .To be doing Gods will .
EMMA: Please ignore him . After two glasses of claret he tends to ecomes mischievous .
DARWIN: No I 'm serious . If thousands are destroyed that a few may live their lives , is not the general sum total of happiness not in some kind of massive deficit ?
INNES: Well far be it from me to speculate on the mind of God , fa less the happiness of an earthworm ha ha ha . But it seems to me that nature is at peaceand most of her denizens are content .
EMMA: Amen .
INNES: You do n't agree .
DARWIN: I think it is a battlefield . A constant and shifting struggle for survival between everything and everything else .
EMMA: I really do think men have a problem with natural beauty . They can not ever just accept it fo what it is . Children ! Sandwiches ! Tell me of your wife Mr Innes .
MRS DAVIES: What is he doing now , exactly ?
BRODIE: Cutting the grass with nail scissors .
MRS DAVIES: Such a shame he never had a proper job . At least your M Thackeray had his books to write .
EMMA: Chop chop Georgie . Socks ! And you have not buttoned your trousers .
ANNIE: Did you never think of getting married Miss Brodie .
BRODIE: Once . But he went to Australia and I missed my chance .
WILLY: Ow . Ow !
BRODIE: Well what do you expect . It is a irds nest .
WILLY: Papa says God does n't care if we are neat .
BRODIE: Your father is a very wize man ut has a small understanding of eligion . No-one can read what goes down in Gods great book of accounts . .Fingernails . Willy presents them for checking .
EMMA: Mrs Davies , Will you ask Jenny to wear a bonnet . I would not like people to think her fast . George aged 5 tugs at her skirt
WILLY: Can I bring my mouse for a lessing ?
EMMA: What mouse ?
GEORGE: Elsie caught it in the barn . We need to pray for his soul
EMMA: Mice do n't have souls . Leave it on the window sill . Everyone come now or we shall be late .
INNES: Ma'am . Welcome . Welcome
DARWIN: Ring the two milky pouters . We 'll sacrifice the tumblers and skeletonize them . Then
BOYS: It 's Mr Hooker . It 's Mr Hooker !
PARSOLOW: Then what Sir ?
DARWIN: Just . to the shed with them . I shall clean myself up . He hurries off .
HOOKER: Good choice Horace . I shall be Lord Raglan and watch the slaughter from a safe distance .
BOYS: - Will you give us a piggy-back ? - Lenny cut his foot on a nail . There was lots of blood !
HOOKER: Emma . Forgive the short notice . You know Thomas Huxley .
EMMA: Only by reputation
HUXLEY: Mrs Darwin .
HOOKER: He insisted on coming and I could not refuse him .
EMMA: Tell papa his visitors are here .
LENNY: He knows already .
HORACE: He went that way .
EMMA: Anyway . Come in please . Come in .
FRANKY: Sir , Is it true when you were in the Himalayas you were imprisoned y the king of Sikkim ?
HOOKER: Absolutely true .
LENNY: And he thought you were a spy fo stealing his rhododendrons ?
HOOKER: That 's approximately true .
FRANKY: .and he would n't let you leave unless you agreed to marry his fattest daughter .
HOOKER: Yes . .but you are never to tell my wife that !
EMMA: Children leave Mr Hooker alone now . I 'm sure he has more important things to discuss .
HOOKER: Not really , but I think Mr Huxley does .
MRS DAVIES: I 'll do that ma'am . Please . Let me do it .
HUXLEY: We 're reforming the Linnean . The committee will comprise myself , Lyell , Huxleyyourself of course if you are willing .
HOOKER: In which the whole story of creation can be read . Do not pretend to me that was not you intention .
HUXLEY: A `` family tree '' of barnacles stretching back 300 million years to the time it was a free swimming prawn ! .
HOOKER: Of course with gaps ! But that is the very point . If we but had the complete fossil record we could trace all life back to one speck of protoplasm . The branching of forms in ever more complex successionuntil .
HUXLEY: .and good riddance to the earded malicious old bugger !
DARWIN: Please I must beg of you .
HUXLEY: No . I must beg of you sir . Joseph Hooker we know is too nice a chap to do it . You are a fine and illiant man who hates to give offence - an admirable quality - wish I had it myself . But what do we believe ? What do we know to be true . Will you light the way o leave us all to flounder in the mire for another decade .
HOOKER: Are you alright ?
HUXLEY: It is time to write your book M Darwin . Write it brilliantly as we all know you can . Strike hard and fast with a blow that is utterly conclusive .
DARWIN: Sir , you are talking like a evolutionary and really
HUXLEY: It is a revolution . And not efore time .
DARWIN: And you 'd replace Gods Laws with what .
HUXLEY: The laws of logic . The laws of nature .
DARWIN: Knowing , as we do , that most capital crimes are her everyday practises Theft , rape , murder , adultery , infanticide . Huxley waves it away
EMMA: Mr Hooker . He turns . He has already said his good-byes .
HOOKER: No-one can push Charles . You know how fixed he is . Bit of a arnacle himself his own words .
EMMA: And if you prize him from his ock he will die . I know you all mean well but .
COACHMAN: All aboard !
HUXLEY: We 'll meet again , Mr Darwin
HOOKER: That it was killing him .
HUXLEY: A mighty slow death considering the time he 's spent . We 'll be dead and buried ourselves if he prevaricates much longer .
ANNIE: Why are you scared ?
DARWIN: Like you said . You 're in it .
ANNIE: Its only a book , silly .
DARWIN: What are you doing , Annie ?
ANNIE: I 'm making you beautiful .
DARWIN: I have to work .
ANNIE: Breath in , papa . Breathe out . Now Tell me a story .
DARWIN: I have no time .
ANNIE: About Jenny . Please ?
DARWIN: Why do you always ask for Jenny ? Its so sad .
ANNIE: That 's why I like it . It makes me cry .
DARWIN: Once apon a time there was a family of Orang-u-tangs living in the jungles of darkest Borneo
ANNIE: `` much to her loving parent 's sorrow . ''
DARWIN: Exactly .
CHARLES: Wait , sorry , wait - I 've got something else here for you
JENNY: Hmph . Meaning `` OK then , I 'm sorry . ''
ANNIE: Go on papa .
DARWIN: Go on what .
ANNIE: The bit where she gets sick and dies .
DARWIN: No . Why do you want to hear that it ?
ANNIE: I just like it . It makes me cry .
EMMA: Are you coming to bed ?
DARWIN: Presently . He does n't move . She comes in
EMMA: What did Huxley want ?
DARWIN: He thinks I should write it and e done with it . He feels it is a question of moral courage o the lack of it .
EMMA: You did not tell him about you health .
DARWIN: His theory is that I am making myself ill by holding back . That I should lance the boil . Plunge in and hang the consequences .
EMMA: Thank the Lord he is not a surgeon . Darwin takes a breath and plunges in himself
DARWIN: I 've concluded he is right . Bite the gag . Speed is everything . It will all be over in a matter of months . Emma is horrified .
EMMA: It is not mere months that concern me Charles . Nor even years or decades
DARWIN: You know that what concerns you concerns me also . What do think has held me in limbo all these years .
CONGREGATION: All things bright and beautiful , all creatures great and small . All things wize and wonderful , The lord God made them all .
DARWIN FAMILY: All things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small . All things wize and wonderful the Lord God made them all .
INNES: Let us pray . Everyone bows their heads in prayer .
DARWIN: Excuse me
INNES: Turn with me now to the book of Job , Chapter Two verse twelve
BEADLE: Are you all right , sir ?
DARWIN: Never better . Thank-you . He heads off up the gravel path
ANNIE: Shh
FRANKY: What are we looking at ?
DARWIN: A weasel .
ANNIE: NO !
DARWIN: Annie , Annie , Annie .
GEORGE: The chickens do that too when cookie kills them
ANNIE: Chickens are different !
DARWIN: The weasel has to eat . Its the way of the world . Annie
ANNIE: Its not fair . Its not fair .
DARWIN: No , its not fair at all .
EMMA: Good-night Lenny .
EMMA: Good-night Betty .
DARWIN: Good-night George
EMMA: Good-night Etty .
DARWIN: Good-night Willy
EMMA: Dear Charles
DARWIN: Dearest Emma
EMMA: `` Loving she is , and tractable though wild . And innocence hath privilege in her . To dignify arch looks and laughing eyes ; And feats of cunning ; and the pretty round Of trespasses , affected to provoke Mock chastisement , and partnership in play '' She puts the book down
DARWIN: Then we were wrong . She is not unique after all .
ETTY: Is this a bit ?
DARWIN: No that is Cretaceous Etty . It was made a hundred millions years ago , when this cliff was a coral eef and Down village was a swamp full of great crocodiles .
GEORGE: What 's a dinosaur ?
ETTY: Professor Owen invented them .
DARWIN: They are the giant lizards which lived on earth before there were any humans .
BETTY: But they were n't real
DARWIN: Of course they are , Betty . Did I never tell you of the skeletons I found in South America Do you remember Mr Martell ?
ETTY: No .
ANNIE: Yes you do . When he came to tea and showed us drawings of his Iguanodon . And George burnt his fingers roasting chestnuts .
ETTY: Oh yes .
ANNIE: She does n't remember .
DARWIN: You should have your clothes on Annie . You are quite blue .
ANNIE: Savages do n't swear clothes .
DARWIN: Well do n't fall and hurt yourself . Your mother would neve forgive me .
ANNIE: I 've found one !
INNES: First positions .
DARWIN: Dearest Hooker . I am one week into the great project and I feel at last that it is real . Its title is `` On the Origin of Species . '' As I write theses words why does it feel as though I am confessing to a murder
EMMA: Are you listening , Annie ? Annie sobs louder , incoherent in her grief .
DARWIN: What happened ?
ANNIE: Nothing .
DARWIN: Its not nothing . Why are your knees bleeding ?
EMMA: Mr Innes had to have words with her . It is sorted now .
DARWIN: Words are very well . I am asking what happened to her knees .
ANNIE: Mr Innes sent me to the corne and made me kneel on rock-salt .
DARWIN: What !
ANNIE: I said there were dinosaurs and he said there was n't dinosaurs ut there were because you saw them .
EMMA: Annie . Let me talk to you father . He told her to kneel til she repented
DARWIN: Repented what ?
EMMA: The bleeding is due to her own stubborn-ness . It is finished now .
DARWIN: It is by no means finished . Where is my coat . Its intolerable
EMMA: Charles . Please .
DARWIN: In his rights to torture ou children for expressing the plain truth .
EMMA: Charles listen to yourself . Listen
DARWIN: Emma please . I will not have Innes tell me what I can and can not tell my children .
EMMA: It is what I have told them every night at bedtime . It is the instruction my aunt and you other and most of our family live by . It is what all of the village believe or try to . Charles . Must our children be evolutionaries at nine years of age . Write to him with you concerns - our concerns - about the manner of the punishment but please do not set yourself against him . Think of my feelings on this . I beg you .
DARWIN: You 're right of course . I 'm sorry . He embraces her .
EMMA: No . Why ?
DARWIN: I can always tell by you playing .
EMMA: Not angry . I 'm sad .
ANNIE: Talk to her .
DARWIN: And say what ? She does not want to hear it .
ANNIE: Then write to her .
DARWIN: That is what I am doing Annie , I am writing all of it .
ANNIE: What 's an oviduct ?
DARWIN: Nothing that need concern you .
ANNIE: I know what it is anyway . Darwin gets up abruptly from his desk .
DARWIN: Pull !
EMMA: `` About the midst of this valley I perceived the mouth of hell to be ; and it stood also hard by the wayside . Now , thought Christian , what shall I do ?
ETTY: Is Daddy not coming to kiss us good-night
EMMA: He is still a little bit ill from working maybe tomorrow .
BETTY: That 's what you said last night .
ETTY: I think when Annie died he stopped loving us . Emma returns to her bedside
EMMA: Oh come now , Etty . You know that 's not true . He is just a little bit ill - and a little bit usy .
ANNIE: Is there really such a place as hell .
DARWIN: No of course not . How can there e ? If he is supposed to be loving and forgiving - what on earth is the sense punishing all these millions of souls .
ANNIE: But just suppose if there was . And all this was punishment .
DARWIN: All what ? No reply .
EMMA: Talk to Mr Innes . Please . You are clearly not well
DARWIN: He is what ? A physician now
EMMA: You know what I mean . I think he can help you .
PARSLOW: Will you be eating sir .
DARWIN: No thank you .
THATCHER: Mr Darwin ! Mr Darwin ! I was explaining to Mr Goodman here your interest in breeding . M Darwin is our foremost scholar in the village .
DARWIN: No . No I am but one of many . There is Squire Lubbock , and the everend Innes
THATCHER: .he is also a noted explorer , the author of many books..
DARWIN: which no-one has read .
THATCHER: a fellow of the Royal society and a prodigious expert on clamsoysters ?
DARWIN: Barnacles .
THATCHER: Mr Goodman , now , is the foremost pigeon fancier in all the southern counties . Kent champion two years running . I swear he can give you any beak or plumage in four generations . Head and tail in five .
DARWIN: How do you do it ?
GOOODMAN: By breeding cousin with cousin . I find it the fastest way to alte the strain - provided you do not weaken it in other ways . Darwin takes a slug of whiskey
DARWIN: Get rid of them .
PARSLOW: Which ones sir ?
DARWIN: All of them . All of it .
PARSLOW: Sir . Mr Darwin .
DARWIN: God know .
PARSLOW: Or the water tower .
DARWIN: A pox on all of them !
DOCTOR: Calomel then , twice daily .
DARWIN: I will not give it to her .
DOCTOR: Well animacules are not persons . Presumably they would die if you dose them with Madeira wine .
DARWIN: On Madeira they thrived most excellently , as did Captain Fitzroy , while it lasted .
DOCTOR: Or if she would submit to be led .
ANNIE: Please no .
DARWIN: I will write to Dr Gully again .
DOCTOR: The hydro-therapist ?
DARWIN: I have always found his treatments most effective .
DOCTOR: no matter that they defy all sense of logic . He is packing up his bottles and his lancets
DARWIN: Logic is not everything .
DOCTOR: Then I shall bid you good day .
DARWIN: Parslow will bring your carriage . I will be down presently
EMMA: I think it is better she is here .
DARWIN: Gully can care for her properly there . She can be treated daily , as I was .
EMMA: Charles no . She is better with us . With her family . Please do not take her away from me .
PARSLOW: Post for you sir . He leaves it by Darwins elbow and backs out . After a while Darwin seems to rouse himself .
DARWIN: Ha ! !
INNES: Ah , there you are Mr Darwin .
DARWIN: By odd means
INNES: Mrs Darwin informed me you would e alone and .perhaps a need to counsel .
DARWIN: Yes . It is from the Spice islands .
INNES: I do rather envy your wide circle of correspondents . In my youth I always wanted to travel .
DARWIN: You are still young . You could be a missionary and follow in M Livingstone 's footsteps .
INNES: Yes , although I have always felt there is quite enough evil at home without looking for it abroad . Mrs Darwin told me of the book you are writing .
DARWIN: Not any more , thank goodness
INNES: You have finished it ?
DARWIN: It has been finished for me . My correspondent In the spice islands has arrived independently at exactly the same idea , expressed in a mere twenty pages .
INNES: The Lord moves in mysterious ways .
DARWIN: He does indeed Mr Innes . I was eflecting only the other day on the fact that he has endowed us in his blessed generosity with not one but nine hundred species of intestinal worm each with its own unique method of infiltrating the blood supply and burrowing through the mucosa . Innes shifts uncomfortably .
INNES: Well . It is not for us to guess at His reasons .
DARWIN: No . We can leave that for M Wallace now . Should I advise him to stay overseas do you think ? If he shows his face in Kent he may e required to kneel on rock salt .
INNES: I once valued our friendship M Darwin . I had hoped it might be possible to restore it . Clearly in your present mood that is not going to be possible . My regards to Mrs Darwin He starts off round the corner of the house .
DARWIN: What ? I am forestalled by M Wallace . That is the simple fact of it . What reason do you have to e angry ? !
EMMA: You have a visitor .
DARWIN: No . No . I will not be bled o lectured to .
HOOKER: It is me . Thank God you are still with us . Word came from London you had suffered an apoplectic stroke .
DARWIN: No . Simply the great relief of liberation . Did you read the Wallace abstract . Hooker bats the idea away
HOOKER: It is a letter . You have a book
DARWIN: barely half of it
HOOKER: You have a book . What is not already on the page is most certainly inside your head and I intend to extract it , if it kills us both .
DARWIN: You have been talking to Huxley .
HOOKER: No . Had I done so he would have hastened here himself armed with every instrument of torture known to her majesty 's navy . Charles I have read the first Chapters . It is brilliant . You must continue .
DARWIN: I can not . Seriously Joseph , I am completely blocked . All my old symptoms have returned with a vengeance . The sweats the shakes the abdominal pains . The whole endeavour was cursed from the outset .
HOOKER: Charles . It was you who opened my eyes to the wonders of science . So let me open yours . You have an illness . You have had it as long as I have known you .
DARWIN: Not Malvern
HOOKER: Why not . What is there to be scared of there . He has worked for you in the past it will work again . Then come back and finish the book . Your enemies are already toasting their good fortune but they shall not prevail .
DARWIN: What are you talking about . I have no enemies .
HOOKER: They are legion , believe me , and they are implacable . We are all of us fighting a battle against fear and superstition but we can win this battle . We must win it . You can win it for all of us . Go to malvern , then come back and finish it .
EMMA: Charles , please reconside
CHARLES: Emma it is weeks now , months . She is getting worse , not better .
EMMA: Then I am coming with you .
DARWIN: You can not come . How can you possibly come in your condition .
EMMA: It is not so far .
DARWIN: It is two days by coach and train . Who will look after the others .
EMMA: I do not care for the others . I care for Annie !
DARWIN: Leave us please , Etty .
BRODIE: Make sure she is tucked in . Watch her shawl
ANNIE: I do n't need to go .
DARWIN: The coach is outside . I will carry her from here .
EMMA: Annie
ANNIE: Mama
DARWIN: You will see Mamma when you are etter . Say goodbye now .
EMMA: Wait . I am coming with you
DARWIN: Please , Emma
EMMA: Wait there .
DARWIN: Get aboard . Brodie
ANNIE: Mama ! The garden gate clangs shut behind them .
DARWIN: Go . Go .
EMMA: Wait !
DARWIN: Go now !
ANNIE: Mama ! !
EMMA: Charles . Please God . No . Annie !
DARWIN: Tell him not this way .
PARSLOW: Hello there . Stop . Can we go by the other route
ATTENDANT: The Worcester Road is shorter .
DARWIN: by the low road .
PARSLOW: He wishes to go by the othe oute .
ATTENDANT: As you will sir .
MR GULLY: Mr Darwin , old friend . Mr Darwin . It has been too long I fear . Tut tut tut tut tut . What have we now what have we now ?
GULLY: tongue Darwin shows him .
MR GULLY: Ugh . Shirt up . Let me feel you liver .
DR GULLY: Pulse hectic , togue furred , live tender and enlarged . Darwin 's ink stained fingers speak volumes .
DARWIN: I was persuaded to write book .
DR GULLY: Madness there are far too many of those already . Are you Sleeping ?
DARWIN: Poorly .
DR GULLY: I suppose never taking the 50C dilution of Chelidonium .
DARWIN: I had the gardener build a wate tower . It no longer has any effect .
GULLY: Of course not . Your gardener is not a hydrotherapist . What on earth possessed you ?
DARWIN: I feared I was dying .
DR GULLY: Oh come come come . We shall not have that talk here .
GULLY: A smart spinal scrub . Cold douche daily at 7.00 . Wrapping in towels and sweating by the lamp . Then , to Darwin
DR GULLY: No red meat , no reading , no mental agitation of any kind . We shall soon have you right old friend , we shall have you right .
BEARDED STRANGER: Mr Darwin is it ?
BEARDED STRANGE: William Carter of Southampton . I ead your Beagle account many years ago . Former naval man myself . What brings you here ? Myself , a Bilious fever with lood per rectum , but I have every faith in Gully . The man is a miracle worker .
GULLY: What action do you most associate with the symptoms . Eating ? Strong emotion ? Strenuous Excercise ?
DARWIN: Does the exercise of memory count as an action .
GULLY: Memory of what .
DARWIN: My eldest daughter . You remembe her .
GULLY: Of course . Of course . You must accept there was nothing more we could do .
DARWIN: I know that . I know .
GULLY: You say you were writing about her .
DARWIN: No . It is a scientific text . But I had reached a point , beyond which it was impossible to progress . She had been my companion throughout . Now it seemed she was ahead of me in a place I could not follow .
GULLY: Of course . Plainly she is in heaven .
DARWIN: That is what my wife believes . It is a great consolation to he
GULLY: But not to you .
DARWIN: Emma and I have become divided on it .
GULLY: Does it affect your marital elations .
DARWIN: We have none to speak of .
GULLY: Are you familiar with the writings of DeQuincy . `` There is no such thing known to the mind as forgetting . ''
DARWIN: I do n't know what it means .
GULLY: He suggests we have thoughts which do not actually enter the ealm of consciousness . Nervous fibres exist after all throughout the whole body . Is it not possible that certain primal feelings manifest in some physical way . Eczema . Boils . A fever . Might some blocked passion imitate a gall-stone ? Or even manufacture one .
DARWIN: Well , until someone devises a machine to read nervous impulses , or a telescope to look inside the body I suppose we can only guess at it .
GULLY: We can Mr Darwin . We can look inside you . If you find yourself open to it , there is a way of seeing .
DARWIN: Mrs St John ?
ST JOHN: Just leave your coat on the table . Sit down here . Show me your palm .
DARWIN: Sorry . I 'm confused . What is it you do exactly .
LANDLORD: No . The door opens on a chain .
DARWIN: My daughter Annie lodged here some years ago . Can I come in ?
LANDLORD: Wait here . I 'll get the missus .
LANDLADY: Which room ?
DARWIN: Fourteen . I would only be there ten minutes . I am happy to pay .
LANDLADY: Up one flight and along the corridor to the right .
DARWIN: I remember .
LANDLADY: Try not to touch anything .
DARWIN: Is she any better ? Does she want for anything ?
BRODIE: There there . It will all soon be over .
DARWIN: Save her . I will believe whatever . Forever . Please save he
ANNIE: Beautifully good . I am making custards .
DARWIN: What ?
ANNIE: The rabbit taught him the polka .
DARWIN: I do n't understand my love .
ANNIE: Tell me about Jenny . Darwin bends low to hear her more clearly .
DARWIN: What about her .
ANNIE: When she died
DARWIN: I do n't want to talk about death my love .
ANNIE: But tell me . I like it .
DARWIN: Well . What the keeper told me was . When she was very sick with pneumonia , lying very still , he tried to feed her but she shook her head , looking at him as though to say `` Its nice of you ut really you should n't bother '' . And as he bent down to take the spoon away she brought her arms around his neck and kissed him . And then she was dead .
EMMA: Take your coat off by the fire there . What time is it ?
DARWIN: We need to talk . I need to talk to you .
EMMA: Of course , but dry your hair . I shall call for a towel .
DARWIN: I went back to Worcester Road . I saw Annie .
EMMA: Charles . No .
DARWIN: Let me tell you .
EMMA: I do n't want to hear it . This must stop .
DARWIN: You do n't understand .
EMMA: I do ! Do you think me deaf and lind . You have lived with he and spoken with her every day since she died .
DARWIN: I know that .
EMMA: Then what is wrong with you that even our poor daughter can not be left in her grave but you would .
DARWIN: I know she is dead . I know it . It is you who will not accept the fact , preferring to think of he in heaven .
EMMA: Get away from me !
DARWIN: Snowy white wings and dancing with the angels . Is that you idea of honesty .
EMMA: Why did you come back . I will not hear this !
DARWIN: You have to Emma , everything these was between us is gone . The boat is wrecked and sunk now . We have to hold to something else .
EMMA: To what . Your ghosts ? You theories ? What Charles .
CHARLES: To the truth of what we know it .
DARWIN: Open this door Emma . The truth , how wonderful and extraordinary our daughter was .
EMMA: I know that . I do not need you to say it . Of course I know .
CHARLES: But free of the fantasy , free of the rest , the silly vain hope that we will be reunited in heaven and the nagging unspoken elief that I killed her !
EMMA: I have never said that
CHARLES: Say it now . Say it . And all the est that follows . That I should have kept Annie warm that day on the beach . I should not have taken her to Malvern . I should have let you come .
EMMA: I should have insisted .
CHARLES: No . It was me . I took her from you It was my fault .
EMMA: I could have followed . I was he mother what was I thinking of .
CHARLES: We thought she would live . You were not to know .
EMMA: I did . I did know . I knew when you left that I would never see her again . I hated you for taking her .
CHARLES: I hated myself . I knew that none of them could save her .
EMMA: What are you saying ?
CHARLES: The unspeakable . I am saying that you and I , in making ou perfect child , endowed her with the very weakness which killed her . Emma . That is what I could n't write . That is what forestalled me all these years . It was n't you I was angry with , it was n't Innes and it was n't God . I was angry with my theory . It was the truth I was angry with . It is the truth .
ANNIE: Tell me a story .
DARWIN: I 'm busy Annie .
ANNIE: I 'll go away again , then you 'll e sorry .
DARWIN: All right , come here , come here . She comes and sits on his lap .
ANNIE: And what did she do ?
DARWIN: I do n't know but I fancy she took them out in the garden and set them free .
EMMA: Yes .
DARWIN: And .
EMMA: I wrapped it and put it on the table there .
THE END: < /pre
DANIEL: Turn on the flashlight .
JULIEN: I 'm trying . It does n't work .
DANIEL: It has to work . You just bought it this afternoon . A beat .
JULIEN: Do they come with batteries ?
DANIEL: You did n't buy batteries ?
JULIEN: I thought they came with batteries .
DANIEL: I ca n't believe you did n't check .
JULIEN: I bought everything you put on the list . Gloves . Pen knives . Flashlight . Batteries were not on the list .
DANIEL: Why should I have to put it on the list ? It 's like saying to buy a car with tires .
JULIEN: Is he dead ?
DANIEL: I do n't know . He looks dead .
JULIEN: He looked dead before he fell .
DANIEL: Start the car ! Start the car !
JULIEN: You did n't think to move the car before we came out ! Daniel looks out his window and sees
DANIEL: Raymond , get us out of here !
RAYMOND: You 're always pointing out my negative qualities . My analyst says positive einforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people .
JULIEN: Fine . Raymond , we 'd like to commend you on how well you fucked up tonight .
MARCEL: I heard you almost got your ass blown off last night . Some thief . A regula lack panther .
RAYMOND: A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties , Marcel . I think you 're referring to The Pink Panther .
MARCEL: Pink panther , black panther . Who gives a shit ? And I do n't remember asking you a God Damn thing , you little turd .
RAYMOND: There 's no reason to be abusive . You 're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism .
MARCEL: What the hell is he talking about ?
RAYMOND: I 'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly .
MARCEL: How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick ?
BASTALDI: Shut up ! Both of you ! You 're giving me a fuckin ' headache .
DANIEL: Where 's your brother ?
BASTALDI: Vincent 's in the States on business . That it ?
RAYMOND: Maybe he did misplace it .
BASTALDI: You misplace your car keys . You misplace your cell phone .
DANIEL: Laurant , how long has he been in there ? Bastaldi looks puzzled .
BASTALDI: I do n't know . What day is today ?
JULIEN: Thursday .
BASTALDI: Is it Thursday already ? This week has just shot by .
DANIEL: Uh , yeah .
BASTALDI: Good . I have a job for you in America .
JULIEN: It seems like a long way to go for a necklace .
DANIEL: Besides , we do n't know the city and
MARCEL: Mr. Bastaldi is n't asking you if you want to go .
BASTALDI: Thank you Marcel , for that extremely edundant explanation .
DANIEL: C'mon , Laurant , America ?
BASTALDI: The job is worth about two million euros . Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money , Daniel . You leave tomorrow . They know they do n't have a choice .
JULIEN: We 're going to need to find someone who knows the city .
MARCEL: I know someone .
SAMI: Oh , Marcel ! I thought you were somebody else . If I knew it was you I would have never run .
MARCEL: Today 's your lucky day , Sami .
SAMI: Yeah , I can see that .
MARCEL: Normally I 'd be breaking your fingers ight now , but I 'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself . We have a group going to Chicago to do a job . You 're going with them .
SAMI: Me ?
MARCEL: You lived there . You know the city .
SAMI: I 've still got a few legal problems back in the States . Marcel glares at him .
MARCEL: If you try to leave town I 'll know . If you manage to leave town I 'll find you and the next time we meet in a bathroom I 'll be cutting you up into little pieces . He hands Sami a piece of paper .
RAYMOND: Yes , Mama . Yes , I have my vitamins . I have everything . Of course I 'm coming ack . I 'm not leaving you . I 'm only going to be gone a few days . I 'll call you when I get there . Okay ? I 've got to go now . Mama , I 've got to go . No , I 'm not yelling .
SAMI: I 'm Sami . Marcel sent me .
JULIEN: What is it you do , Sami ?
SAMI: You know , a little of this , a little of that . I 've boosted cars , stole radios , un a few scams . Right now I 'm into pick-pocketing .
JULIEN: I see . A master criminal .
SAMI: Hey , I was told to come here by Marcel . You guys do n't want me , I 'll be more than happy to leave .
DANIEL: This is Zero .
SAMI: Hi . I 'm one and this is two , three , four and five .
JULIEN: Let me give you some advice . You do n't want to piss him off because he 'll kill you for the fun of it . What you want to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you .
ZERO: So , we are going to America ?
DANIEL: In English . Sami does n't speak French .
ZERO: Where are you from ?
SAMI: Algeria .
ZERO: And you do n't speak French ?
SAMI: Well , you know , not all Algerians speak French . It 's a matter of what school you went too . Me I never really
ZERO: Zero is n't interested in your life story . Who gets killed ?
DANIEL: Hopefully no one .
ZERO: No one ? Then why is Zero here ? Sami leans over to Raymond .
SAMI: He speaks about himself in the third person ?
RAYMOND: Feel free to correct him if you want .
DANIEL: I just want you there in case there 's trouble .
ZERO: And if there is , then Zero can kill someone ?
DANIEL: We 'll see .
BASTALDI: I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage and tell you that Marcel will be going with you .
DANIEL: What ?
BASTALDI: This is a considerable move up for you , Daniel . The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you .
DANIEL: You do n't trust me ?
BASTALDI: I do n't trust anyone . You do n't get to the top of this game by trusting people and after all , you are a thief . It 's in your nature to steal . I 'm just protecting my investment .
MARCEL: That 's better .
BASTALDI: Stop it ! Both of you !
MARCEL: que je t'aime que je
TAXI DRIVER: Are you sure you guys have the right address ? This ai n't no tourist area .
MARCEL: Yes . We are sure .
SAMI: Let me handle this .
LAMAR: Do n't you brother me , motherfucker .
JULIEN: Dirty underwear . Lamar forces a laugh .
LAMAR: Dirty underwear . That 's a good one . Let me explain something to you . This is my street and you 're gon na give me want I what or I 'm gon na bust your heads open .
RAYMOND: Lamar , violence is never an answer to settling disputes . I can see you have a lot of anger but this is not the way to get it out .
LAMAR: Get outta my face !
ZERO: Va te faire foutre !
LAMAR: What did he say ?
DANIEL: He said to go fuck yourself .
ZERO: We are tired and bored with your bullshit . So , put that stupid little knife away efore Zero shoves it up your ass .
LAMAR: Who is Zero ?
JULIEN: He is .
LAMAR: He speaks about himself in the third person ? Julien shrugs his shoulders .
ZERO: If you insist .
SAMI: You put a loaded gun in your bag and ought it through customs ? How stupid is that ?
ZERO: Zero did not put it in his bag . He put it in yours . Zero grins and walks away .
MARCEL: We are looking for Sophie . Laurant send us .
SAMI: Ouh La La .
SOPHIE: I was n't expecting this many of you . I 've got a few sleeping bags you can use .
SAMI: Thanks .
SOPHIE: This is Wayne . My roommate . Raymond walks over to him .
RAYMOND: I am Raymond . Thank you for allowing us to stay here .
WAYNE: No problem , man . Hey , you wan na hit ?
RAYMOND: No thank you .
WAYNE: Yeah , I dig him .
RAYMOND: Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme We are all searching for love . No ?
WAYNE: Whoa That 's deep .
SOPHIE: You guys hungry ?
WAITRESS: Ready to order ? Julien looks up at her .
JULIEN: Could we see a wine list please ?
WAITRESS: That 's cute .
SOPHIE: They do n't have a wine list .
JULIEN: Oh , then we will have the house wine .
WAITRESS: Sure and would you like that before your escargot in white truffle sauce ?
JULIEN: I did not order escargot .
SAMI: They do n't serve wine here .
JULIEN: What kind of restaurant does n't serve wine ?
SAMI: This kind .
JULIEN: Okay . I will have a beer .
WAITRESS: I do n't think he 's grasping the concept . Iced tea , lemonade , coca cola , sprite o oot beer .
JULIEN: C'est quoi root beer ?
DANIEL: He 'll have a sprite . We 'll all have sprite .
WAITRESS: Good . Now that we 've gotten the beverage selection out of the way , dare we move on to the main course ?
ZERO: Idiot .
WAITRESS: And no smoking .
ZERO: No smoking ? No drinking ? What kind of country is this ?
VINNY: I 'm sorry , Frankie . Really .
ZAMMITO: You bleed on me , I 'll kill ya . Vinny takes a step back .
VINNY: Frankie , I
ZAMMITO: Shut up ! Do n't you try to make me feel bad about this . You knew what would happen to you if you did n't pay . This is on your head , not mine . Break his arm .
VINNY: Jesus , Frankie , I 'm your brother !
ZAMMITO: That 's why we 're only breaking one arm .
SOPHIE: There 's an exterior alarm system . There 's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector . The control panel is in the bedroom .
JULIEN: I can handle the exterior alarm , but the one in the bedroom is a problem .
SAMI: After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window .
DANIEL: Good . Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector . The rest of us will come in through the front door .
JULIEN: What about transportation ?
SOPHIE: You can use my car .
DANIEL: Not a good idea . Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you . Raymond , you 'll steal one .
RAYMOND: No problem .
SAMI: When do we go ?
SOPHIE: Tonight .
DANIEL: Tonight ?
SOPHIE: I know they wo n't be home tonight .
SAMI: You ever hear of jet lag ?
SOPHIE: Take a nap .
JULIEN: What the hell is that ?
WAYNE: Neighbors . They do this all the time .
SAMI: I ca n't even hear myself think .
ZERO: How are we supposed to sleep with this noise ?
SOPHIE: I 've asked them a hundred times to keep in down . They do n't listen .
RAYMOND: I will talk to them . Sophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing .
WAYNE: Yeah . Right .
SOPHIE: Not a good idea .
RAYMOND: It 's just a matter of communication . Raymond leaves .
BIKER: No .
RAYMOND: But the music is very
BIKER: Fuck off ! He slams the door in Raymond 's face .
WAYNE: What 'd you say to them ?
MARCEL: Nothing .
ZAMMITO: Hey , Bobby beans How you doin ' ?
BOBBY BEANS: Good . I 'm doing good . How you doin ' , Frankie ?
ZAMMITO: Good . I 'm good .
BOBBY BEANS: Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards .
ZAMMITO: When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family . Zammito motions for Bobby to sit down .
BOBBY BEANS: No thank you .
ZAMMITO: You sure ? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily . Special blend . Ca n't find anything like it in the States .
BOBBY BEANS: I 'm good . Really .
ZAMMITO: Okay . I understand you 're interested in one of our properties ?
BOBBY BEANS: Yeah . That warehouse over on Merchant Street . The volume on our import business has risen dramatically . The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the
ZAMMITO: Super what ?
BOBBY BEANS: Supernumerary . It means better than expected .
ZAMMITO: Then why not just fuckin ' say bette than expected ? Everybody knows what etter than expected means .
BOBBY BEANS: I 'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills .
ZAMMITO: Okay . How much ?
BOBBY BEANS: I 'm not here to negotiate .
ZAMMITO: Why are you here ?
BOBBY BEANS: To tell you that we 're interested in the property .
ZAMMITO: You told me that on the phone . What the hell are you doing here ? Showing off your communication skills ? Go back to your people and tell them when they 're serious to put a number on the table .
BOBBY BEANS: I will relay the particulars of ou conversation to Mr. Maranzano .
ZAMMITO: Yeah you do that . Bobby Beans leaves .
SOPHIE: You like shoes ?
SAMI: No , I like the bag . It would be good for the job tonight .
SOPHIE: It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi . He left it last time he was here . I 'm sure he would n't mind if you used it .
SAMI: Just lucky I guess . How 'd you start working for the Bastaldi 's ?
SOPHIE: The art world does n't fully appreciate my talent yet . I needed some way to pay the rent . Laurant and Vincent pay well for information .
SAMI: So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed ?
SOPHIE: They 're not nice people .
SAMI: Something like that .
SOPHIE: Did she break your heart ?
SAMI: Something like that .
SOPHIE: It looks old . Did you get it a long time ago ?
SAMI: You ask a lot of questions .
SOPHIE: That 's how you get to know someone . Did it hurt when you got it ?
SAMI: I do n't remember . I was drunk .
SOPHIE: You got it in a bar ?
SAMI: No . I got it in prison . I went in fo three years . When I came out she was married to my best friend . Happy ?
SOPHIE: Sorry . I did n't mean to pry .
SAMI: It 's okay . It was a long time ago .
SOPHIE: I 've been thinking about getting tattoo . You know , a flower or something . On my ass . Sami looks at her quizzically .
SAMI: Who 's gon na see it there ?
SOPHIE: The lucky ones . She smiles flirtatiously and walks away .
RAPHAEL: Gim me the money !
OLD MAN: I do n't have the combination .
HECTOR: Hey , Vato , where 's your car ? Raphael stops as he sees the street is empty .
RAPHAEL: My car !
JULIEN: It 's Raymond . He 's outside with the car .
SOPHIE: For luck .
SAMI: I 'm glad you did n't get something flashy .
RAYMOND: Watch this .
HECTOR: Maybe you should call the police .
RAPHAEL: Hey , idiot I 've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car .
HECTOR: I just thought that
RAPHAEL: Do n't think . Okay ? You 're not good at it . The other Gang Bangers laugh at Hector .
ZAMMITO: Yeah ?
MARIO: Of course , Mr. Zammito .
BONANNO: Frankie , come in . Good to see you . You want something ?
ZAMMITO: No , I 'm good , Angelo .
BONANNO: I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today .
ZAMMITO: Yeah . Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse .
BONANNO: And ?
ZAMMITO: And nothing . He 's just feeling us out .
BONANNO: He 's trying to get a foot hold in ou territory .
ZAMMITO: He sticks his toes in the water again , we 'll cut 'em off .
BONANNO: Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property .
ZAMMITO: I heard this quarter his profits are gon na be supernumerary . Bonanno stares at him .
BONANNO: They 're gon na be what ?
ZAMMITO: Supernumerary . It means better than expected .
BONANNO: Good word .
ZAMMITO: Someone else coming ?
BONANNO: Nah , that 's just Tony 's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes . You ever watch it ?
ZAMMITO: Uh , no
BONANNO: You should . You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that . Very informative . Stay and watch it with me .
ZAMMITO: You know , I 'm kind of tired . I 'm just gon na go home if it 's all the same to you .
BONANNO: Go . Rest .
ZAMMITO: He missed three weeks .
BONANNO: Your own brother ? You could n't send someone else to do it ?
ZAMMITO: I did . Joey `` Two Tons '' and Nicky `` The Rake '' did the deed .
BONANNO: But you were there ?
ZAMMITO: Angelo , we live and die by the rules we make . We are men of honor , but hono without respect is a horse-less carriage .
BONANNO: What the fuck does that mean ?
DANIEL: Park on the next street over . We 'll meet you when we 're done .
ZERO: We 're in .
DANIEL: So much for no one being home . Julien goes to a bookcase and finds the safe .
JULIEN: At least they got this right .
SAMI: We 've got to be careful not to use ou eal names while we 're in here .
DANIEL: Good idea .
SAMI: I 'll be Elvis and you
MARCEL: I want to be Elvis .
SAMI: It 's my idea .
MARCEL: C'mon , I look more like Elvis than you do .
SAMI: Okay . You can be Elvis . Marcel smiles happily .
MARCEL: Hey , Barry Bonds . The home run king .
AGENT HADLEY: Looks like Zammito 's being robbed .
FBI AGENT: Should I call C.P.D . ?
AGENT HADLEY: Yeah , but tell them not to move until these morons come out of the house .
JULIEN: Where are the jewels ? There are n't any jewels . Marcel looks as surprised as they are .
MARCEL: There has to be .
JULIEN: I 'm telling you I 've pulled out everything in the safe . There are n't any jewels .
MARCEL: There must be half a million dollars here though .
DANIEL: Marcel , we came here for jewels , remember ?
SAMI: We have a problem . Problem is n't the ight word . Dilemma . No that really does n't describe Do you know who that is ?
MARCEL: Mr. Taylor ?
SAMI: No , that 's not Mr. Taylor .
DANIEL: It 's not ?
SAMI: That 's Frankie Zammito . The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia .
MARCEL: Why would they want us to rob the Mafia ?
MARCEL: Mr. Zammito , there seems to have been a ig mistake here . May I use your phone ?
ZAMMITO: Feel free . Marcel picks up the cordless phone and dials .
BASTALDI: Hello ?
MARCEL: Yes .
BASTALDI: You 're calling me on your cell phone , ight ?
MARCEL: No .
ZAMMITO: Walk out of here with nothing and I 'll forget this ever happened .
SAMI: Yeah . Right . You 're not a vendetta kind of guy .
ZAMMITO: I 'll find you . No matter where you go I 'll find you .
DANIEL: You do n't carry the same weight in France as you do here . Marcel whispers into Daniel 's ear .
MARCEL: You think it 's smart to tell him we 're French ?
DANIEL: I think he 's already figured that out .
ZERO: We are being watched . Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks .
DANIEL: Cops ?
ZAMMITO: FBI . They 've been there for months . Think I do n't know . Morons .
JULIEN: What do we do ?
MARCEL: I was told to take what we have and go .
JULIEN: Go where ? The police are outside . Daniel looks at the others .
DANIEL: If we do this we all have to agree .
SAMI: C'mon , get real , will you . You think he 's just going to forget about this ? These guys are all about respect . All about honor . He 's coming after us , so we might as well take the money .
ZAMMITO: You 're all dead . Zero grins then tapes his mouth closed again .
SOPHIE: I was n't expecting you guys back so fast . How 'd it go ? She quickly notices their angry expressions .
SAMI: How 'd it go ? I do n't know . Daniel , how would you say it went ?
DANIEL: I would have to say pretty fuckin ' ad . You gave us the wrong address Sophie .
SOPHIE: No , I did n't .
JULIEN: Bastaldi got the address from you , yes ?
SOPHIE: Yes .
JULIEN: And he gave it to us . 145 Ridgeway Road .
SOPHIE: No . 145 Ridgeroad Way .
DANIEL: That moron .
MARCEL: It was an honest mistake . Ridgeway Ridgeroad Ridgeway Road .
DANIEL: Everyone get some sleep . We 're leaving in the morning .
AGENT HADLEY: What the hell are they doing in there ?
FBI AGENT: Chicago P.D . says they ca n't hold the units here any longer . They want to know if they should go in ? Agent Hadley thinks a moment .
AGENT HADLEY: Tell them no . We 'll advise if anything changes .
RAPHAEL: Someone stole my car tonight !
FELIX: C'mon Raphael , you do n't think that I would steal your car ?
RAPHAEL: You run a chop shop for low riders . Yes , I think you 'd steal my car .
FELIX: I swear I did n't . I would n't !
RAPHAEL: And I should just believe
HECTOR: you stole my cousin Enrique 's car .
RAPHAEL: Hector , do n't interrupt me .
HECTOR: He told Enrique he did n't know anything about his car .
RAPHAEL: I do n't give a shit about your cousin 's car . We 're here about my car . So , shut your mouth ! You think you can do that ? You think you can keep your big mouth shut ?
FBI AGENT: Sir , do you think we could have a hostage situation in there ?
AGENT HADLEY: Hold on a second . Joey `` Two Tons '' just pulled up .
ZAMMITO: They were all French guys .
SOPHIE: Ca n't sleep ?
SAMI: No .
SOPHIE: I 'm sorry things went so wrong today .
SAMI: It 's not your fault . She notices the box of tapes .
SOPHIE: What are you doing ?
SAMI: I thought I 'd listen to some of the tapes . See what 's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe .
SOPHIE: Sounds boring .
SAMI: It 's three in the morning . Not much else to do .
SOPHIE: I can think of something . They kiss .
WAYNE: She 's not here , man .
SAMI: Where is she ?
WAYNE: I think she went to do some laundry . Threw some stuff in a bag and left .
SAMI: Bag ?
JULIEN: Oh , man this is bullshit ! You ca n't trust anyone these days .
RAYMOND: She took everything ! Did n't even leave us cab fare . A thought occurs to Sami .
SAMI: Not everything .
WAYNE: No you did n't , dude . You were bangin ' Sophie . I saw you guys going at it .
DANIEL: You slept with her ?
SAMI: Well , actually I would say she slept with me . Daniel stares at him angrily .
DANIEL: You did n't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you ?
SAMI: No . Chicks dig me .
MAN'S VOICE: Hello ?
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: It 's me . I need an answer from you if I 'm going to move .
MAN'S VOICE: We 're not just talkin ' about a 'piece of work ' here . We 're talking about a boss .
SAMI: Holy shit .
RAYMOND: What ?
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: Bonanno 's a dinosaur . Guy thinks he 's fuckin ' Vito Corleone or something . The old ways are gone . If we do n't change now we 're going to get pushed out . I need to know if I can count on you support ? A pause on the line .
MAN'S VOICE: Yeah . The line goes dead . Sami leans back .
SAMI: No wonder Zammito did n't want us to walk out with this stuff . He 's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family .
JULIEN: This was n't the deal ! The deal was to steal a necklace , not get in the middle of a Mafia war .
MARCEL: The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is .
DANIEL: You know , if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi 's ass for two seconds you might see what 's going on around you .
JULIEN: I knew this was a mistake ! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this . I could hear that little voice in my head saying , `` do n't do it ! Do n't you do it ! '' Jesus , why do n't I ever listen to myself ?
SAMI: Yeah , but you did do it . So let 's deal with that .
MARCEL: What are you guys so scared of ? Zammito does n't know who we are . We just get out of town and it 's over .
ZERO: Oh , you think it 's that easy ?
RAYMOND: Yeah . We just go home .
DANIEL: We ca n't .
RAYMOND: I agree with Marcel . I say we go to the airport and get on a plane .
SAMI: They 'll be waiting for us at the airport .
DANIEL: You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time . But these tapes . He 's never going to stop looking for us .
SAMI: We have to find Sophie .
RAYMOND: How are we going to do that ?
WAYNE: I know where she went .
RAPHAEL: Tell me the truth Hector do you think we 'll find my car ?
HECTOR: Hard to say .
RAYMOND: How do we know what room she 's in ?
SAMI: Wait here .
MOTEL CLERK: I ca n't give out information on ou guests .
SAMI: C'mon man , I think she 's having an affair .
MOTEL CLERK: So are half the people in this place . I ca n't help you , pal .
ZERO: Thank you .
SAMI: I really thought we had something special going . I ca n't tell you what a disappointment you 've turned out to be .
SOPHIE: After last night I could say the same for you .
RAYMOND: The money is n't here .
SAMI: Where is it , Sophie ?
SOPHIE: I do n't know .
DANIEL: If you think because you 're a women this ca n't go hard on you , think again . She stares at them defiantly .
SAMI: Who are you waiting for ?
SOPHIE: Stick around and find out .
ZERO: He 's FBI .
RAYMOND: What is she doing with an agent du FBI ?
SAMI: We 've been set up . He stares at Sophie angrily .
ZERO: What does arresting us get them ?
SAMI: You wan na tell him ?
AGENT HADLEY: You 're telling it fine . Daniel motions to Zero .
DANIEL: You see my friend over there ? I nod to him and he 's going to put a bullet in your knee .
AGENT HADLEY: You would n't .
SAMI: He 's got a point .
AGENT HADLEY: Okay ! Okay ! We 've been investigating Zammito for years , but we 've never had enough evidence for a warrant to search his house . We got word through a snitch that Zammito was planning on taking Bonanno out .
DANIEL: We know all this .
AGENT HADLEY: You just do n't take out a boss . You need permission from the other families to do something like that . Our informant told us that Zammito was talking with other bosses and recording thei conversations in case they later claimed they were n't involved . Look at these tapes . The guy has recorded every conversation he 's had for years .
DANIEL: So we rob Zammito . You arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against him . Agent Hadley nods .
SAMI: What are you getting out of this ? There is no point in hiding anything now .
SOPHIE: Money . It was supposed to simple . In and out .
ZAMMITO: Mario , I got ta go . When my date arrives will you explain to her I had an emergency .
MARIO: Of course , Mr. Zammito .
SOPHIE: Hi . I 'm meeting Frankie Zammito
SAMI: Why ?
SOPHIE: Vincent Bastaldi is in jail .
DANIEL: For what ?
SOPHIE: Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito .
DANIEL: What kind of business ?
SOPHIE: Black market art . Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum . The Bastaldi 's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works . They 'd switch the paintings , send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi 's would sell them to private collectors .
AGENT HADLEY: We 're talking Matisse , Renoir , Monet . We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh 's `` Vase with twelve sunflowers '' last week with a copy . It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they 're not going to be very happy when they find out about it .
SAMI: So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother ?
AGENT HADLEY: Yeah . He delivers the goods on Zammito . If we got what we wanted we 'd let his other go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are .
RAYMOND: No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison .
DANIEL: We 're leaving . Raymond get the bag .
AGENT HADLEY: You walk out with that bag and you wo n't only have Zammito and his people afte you . You 'll have the entire United States justice department . How far do you think you 'll get ? I know who you are Mr . Foray ? Mr. Zerhouni . Mr. Gayet . Mr Agent Hadley looks to Sophie .
SOPHIE: Zero . That 's all I know .
AGENT HADLEY: You 'll never get out of the city . They move to the door .
DANIEL: Bastaldi 's dead . He is fuckin ' dead !
ZERO: You want Zero to kill him ?
DANIEL: I 'm going to kill him myself !
ZERO: What about the money ?
SAMI: It has to be at Sophie 's . She did n't have time to go anywhere else before she came here .
ZERO: We do n't know that for sure .
DANIEL: Forget the money ! We 've got bigge problems than the money right now .
RAYMOND: She probably hid it at her place . The six of us could find it in
SAMI: We do n't have time to look for it . Hadley 's first move is going to be to look for us there . Daniel dials a number on his cell phone .
DANIEL: We 're moving . Pack up and be on the street in five minutes .
AGENT HADLEY: This is turning to shit . If word gets out of my involvement in this I 'll go to prison .
SOPHIE: Listen , we know their names . They do n't know the city . You 'll find them . You 're the FBI .
AGENT HADLEY: I ca n't bring the Bureau into this . If I do the tapes become evidence .
SOPHIE: They 're supposed to be evidence . That 's why Bastaldi set this up .
AGENT HADLEY: Fuck Bastaldi and his brother . These tapes are gold . Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back ?
SOPHIE: I thought you wanted Zammito ?
AGENT HADLEY: What for ? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place . I 've een doing this for twenty years . When I retire it 's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs .
SOPHIE: Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows ca n't say anything . His jaw tightens .
AGENT HADLEY: You 're right about that .
RAYMOND: I would like to thank you for you hospitality . If you are ever in Paris here is my number .
WAYNE: Cool .
DANIEL: I 'll be right back . He gets out of the car and walks over to him .
LAMAR: What do you want now ?
DANIEL: Guns . Can you get them ?
LAMAR: Man , I can get anything .
DANIEL: Do n't bullshit me .
LAMAR: I ai n't bullshittin ' . I can get guns . I can get any kind of gun you want . But they ai n't gon na help your sorry ass . You ai n't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you . How is that possible ?
DANIEL: I 've got a way with people .
LAMAR: I can see that . The man 's car you stole . Raphael Ruiz . He 's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker . And Frankie Zammito 's got the word out he 's looking for some French dudes . You 're French ai n't ya ?
DANIEL: I 'm from Belgium .
LAMAR: Yeah , I 'd be from Belgium too if I was you . You know Zammito just put his own other in the hospital ? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt . I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin ' for you .
DANIEL: Why have n't you turned us in ?
LAMAR: I ai n't no rat . You got money , right ? Daniel nods .
DANIEL: How much ?
LAMAR: A thousand dollars ?
DANIEL: Fine . Daniel hands him his cell phone .
WAYNE: Yeah ? Hadley pushes past Wayne and enters .
AGENT HADLEY: Not today . Where are your friends ?
WAYNE: They left about a half hour ago .
AGENT HADLEY: Where did they go ?
WAYNE: I dunno .
AGENT HADLEY: What ? This ? Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the chest .
WAYNE: Jesus . What kind of FBI agent are you ?
AGENT HADLEY: I 'm your worst fuckin ' nightmare . Now , if you do n't want me to keep on hurting you , it 's important that I believe you and right now I do n't . So tell me , where did they go ?
WAYNE: I swear man , I do n't know . They packed up and left a half hour ago . All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris .
MAID: Maid service .
RAYMOND: I know Mama , but I could n't call you yesterday we were very busy . No , nothing 's more important than you . I do n't know . I think I 'm going to have to stay a few more days .
DANIEL: Did you know about Bastaldi 's deal with Zammito ?
MARCEL: No .
DANIEL: You 're sure ?
MARCEL: I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh 's `` Sunflowers in a vase '' I would remember it .
SAMI: `` Vase with twelve Sunflowers . ''
MARCEL: Whatever ! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings .
SAMI: It makes sense . I mean , do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up ?
DANIEL: I think he 'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to .
MARCEL: Fuck you ! You know I 'd never go along with something like this .
DANIEL: Do I ?
MARCEL: This ai n't about that and you know it . This is about you never forgiving me fo leaving the crew .
SAMI: You guys used to work together ?
MARCEL: Yeah and he ca n't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself .
DANIEL: You call being Bastaldi 's lap dog better ?
MARCEL: Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night .
SAMI: All right , knock it off .
DANIEL: All you are is a professional ass-kisser .
MARCEL: I 'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you 're testing mine .
DANIEL: What is that a threat ? Are you fuckin ' threatening me , Marcel ?
SAMI: I said knock it off ! Now as far as I 'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over , but ight now we 've got to figure out what 's going on .
RAYMOND: It 's simple . Bastaldi 's moving up . He 's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us .
JULIEN: Well , I say the whole deal is off . In fact , if you ask me , there never was a deal because we were screwed from the start .
ZERO: Hey Sami , you 're on TV . Zero turns up the volume .
REPORTER: Sami Zerhouni in connection with the murder of Sophie Nichols . Sami is stunned .
SAMI: What ?
REPORTER: Police have confirmed that Zerhouni was seen entering the woman 's room by the Motel Manager .
ZAMMITO: Oh , shit !
REPORTER: The other members of his gang are reported to be French nationals Daniel Foray , Marcel Burot , Julien Labesse Pull back again
LAMAR: Dumb crackers
REPORTER: Raymond Gayet and an unidentified man only known as Zero . Pull back again
AGENT HADLEY: That should shake things up .
SAMI: Hadley
DANIEL: Has to be .
JULIEN: This is bad . This is really fuckin ' ad . Am I the only one who sees how bad this is ?
SAMI: Hey , it 's not your picture on the TV , it 's mine . So , try to be cool .
JULIEN: Do n't tell me to be cool ! We were supposed to be in and out . In and out ! In the last twenty four hours we 've managed to get the Mafia the FBI the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us . I have n't left out anyone , have I ? I do n't think so , because we 've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin ' city !
SAMI: We 've got to get out of here .
JULIEN: That 's brilliant ! Care to elaborate ? Sami gets into Julien 's face .
SAMI: You 're not helping .
RAYMOND: Julien , what you 're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress . You 're projecting your ange onto us .
JULIEN: Oh , Jesus . We 're dead .
LAMAR: Yeah ?
DANIEL: Sami , tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us .
JULIEN: What for ?
DANIEL: We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card .
RAYMOND: Why not just steal another one ?
DANIEL: Too risky . We do n't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car .
JULIEN: Maybe I 'm missing the obvious , but why are n't we leaving town ? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago .
SAMI: It does n't matter where we go . Between Zammito and the FBI they 'll find us . We have to end this here .
ZERO: And how do we do that ?
SAMI: I do n't know .
JULIEN: That 's an excellent plan . Very comforting .
DANIEL: We 'll think of something .
BONANNO: Why did n't you tell me about this ?
ZAMMITO: You have enough to worry about , Angelo . You do n't need my problems .
BONANNO: We 're family . An insult to you is an insult to me . Bonanno releases him .
ZAMMITO: Yes .
BONANNO: What is happening with the world ? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man . Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something . What did they take ?
ZAMMITO: Some cash . Jewelry . The other stuff I can replace , but there 's a cardboard ox photos of my mother . They 're the only ones I have of her .
BONANNO: We 're doing everything we can to find these people . Right Tony ?
ZAMMITO: Get in the car .
BLACK GUY: I 'm gon na have to search you .
DANIEL: We 'll save you the trouble .
BLACK GUY: You ca n't come in here with that . Daniel looks past him to Ellwood .
DANIEL: What 's wrong with this guy ?
ELLWOOD: He 's my cousin . He 's deaf . Daniel removes an envelope full of cash .
DANIEL: We 're here to buy , not steal . If you guys are straight there 's not going to e a problem .
ELLWOOD: Let them in .
DANIEL: How much for the nines ?
ELLWOOD: A grand a piece .
DANIEL: I 'll need extra clips and ammo .
LAMAR: What the hell you doing , Ellwood ? I gave them my word .
ELLWOOD: Zammito 's offering twenty grand a head for these guys . You think I 'm going to settle for four G 's when I can make forty ? All right . Reach in easy and put the gun on the floor .
ZERO: No .
ELLWOOD: No ? Did you just say no ? Listen cowboy , if you 're thinking about makin ' a move , do n't . Nobody is that fast .
ZERO: Zero is .
ELLWOOD: Who 's Zero ?
LAMAR: He is .
BLACK GUY: Found it !
DANIEL: There 's ten grand in here . It 's yours . I 'm going to call you again . There 's one more thing I need you to do .
LAMAR: What ?
DANIEL: I 'll tell you when it 's time .
RAYMOND: I am not comfortable with this . I 'm not a good liar .
JULIEN: Relax . It will be fine .
RAYMOND: Hello . I am Robert M. Carney from Dayton , Ohio and I would like to rent a car with my visa gold card .
ZAMMITO: Angie , how you doin ' ?
ANGIE: I 've gained weight .
ZAMMITO: Yeah , well , it suits you .
RICHIE: I 'm Richie . He 's Tommy .
ZAMMITO: Whatever .
ANGIE: Gee , five bucks . What ever shall we uy ? She takes the kids and leaves .
ZAMMITO: She seems pleasant enough .
VINNY: She does n't know . She thinks I fell down the stairs .
ZAMMITO: That 's good . That 's what a stand-up guy does . Zammito sits on the edge of the bed .
VINNY: You broke my arm . How the hell do you think I 'm doin ' ?
ZAMMITO: Yeah . I mean besides that . They treating you all right ? Food okay ?
VINNY: Yeah . I 'm going home today . What do you want , Frankie ?
ZAMMITO: I do n't want anything .
VINNY: A little ?
ZAMMITO: Yeah . I mean , you are my brother and well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment . So , I 've decided to make it up to you .
VINNY: You gon na forget about the money I owe you ?
ZAMMITO: What are you nuts ? A debt is a debt . I was thinking I 'd throw a little extra work your way . You know , you come down to the club , make espresso for the boys wash their cars run some errands things like that . Zammito 's cell phone rings .
GANG MEMBER: I ai n't seen it your car . Sorry man . Hey , you know who you should talk to is Freddy O .
RAPHAEL: I thought he was in prison .
GANG MEMBER: Got out last month . He 's trying to go straight but he 's still wired in .
SAMI: Do you know who this is ?
JULIEN: Everything okay now ?
ZAMMITO: I do n't know the little one , but the other guy is definitely one of them . Follow them and call me when you find out where they go . Zammito walks back to his car and drives off .
JULIEN: I 'll drive .
RAYMOND: I 'm the driver .
JULIEN: I 've never driven a Cadillac before . Raymond nods and gets in the passenger seat .
RAYMOND: This is the only American car you 've ever driven .
SAMI: You set me up , you piece of shit !
AGENT HADLEY: You think I 'm going to talk to you until I know if you 're wired .
SAMI: Wired ? I ai n't wired .
AGENT HADLEY: Okay . Okay . I believe you .
SAMI: You killed her !
AGENT HADLEY: No . You killed her . Manager remembers you going into her room . You fingerprints were found all over the place .
SAMI: Bullshit ! She was alive when we left her with you .
AGENT HADLEY: You 're fucked , Sami . You know it . That 's why you 're here .
SAMI: Look , I just want out of this nightmare . I do n't know these guys . A few days ago I 'm in Paris picking pockets and now I 'm America 's most wanted .
AGENT HADLEY: Where are the tapes ?
SAMI: I can get them but what do I get if I do ?
AGENT HADLEY: A pass .
SAMI: A pass ? How you gon na give me a pass ? A witness can put me at the crime scene .
AGENT HADLEY: Witness ' can be convinced they made a mistake . Without the murder weapon the D.A . wo n't have enough to prosecute you .
SAMI: They do n't have a murder weapon ?
AGENT HADLEY: No . I have it . The lamp ? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it ? Remember ?
SAMI: You want the tapes for yourself . You 're going to sell them .
AGENT HADLEY: I 'm going to retire with a shit-load of money . Find me a small country that does n't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life .
SAMI: You did n't have to kill Sophie .
AGENT HADLEY: Yes I did . Lose ends are messy .
SAMI: What about me ? Are n't I a loose end ?
AGENT HADLEY: When this is over you can say whateve the hell you want . I 'll be long gone . Besides , who 's going to believe you ? You 're just a two-bit crook .
SAMI: And you 're a dirty cop . At least I do n't pretend to be something different than what I am . Hadley hands him a card .
AGENT HADLEY: When you 've got the tapes call me on this number . We 'll make the exchange and that 'll be the end of it . Hadley leaves .
JULIEN: We 're being followed . Julien hits the gas .
RAYMOND: I knew I should have driven .
JULIEN: Stop talking . I 'm trying to concentrate .
RAYMOND: What are we going to
JULIEN: When we get to the next corner jump out .
RAYMOND: I 'm not going to leave you .
JULIEN: We both know I 'm already dead .
DANIEL: Julien ?
SAMI: It 's not your fault , Daniel .
DANIEL: No ? He looks at them sadly .
MARCEL: We all agreed to it . You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up .
DANIEL: I just want to live long enough to get ack to Paris . Just long enough to kill Bastaldi .
SAMI: I say we make him pay first . After that you can do whatever you want to him .
RAYMOND: He 's right . Do you have any idea what Van Gogh 's `` Vase with twelve Sunflowers '' is worth ?
MARCEL: No . How much ?
RAYMOND: I do n't know . It 's got ta be millions .
DANIEL: We still have to get out of here .
MARCEL: Maybe if we gave the tapes back
ZERO: No . Everyone looks to Zero .
SAMI: He 's right . The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi .
AGENT HADLEY: Hello ? Mrs. Gayet ? Do you speak English ? You do . Great . Oh , you taught Raymond English . You did a wonderful job .

MARCEL: How about Canada ?
RAYMOND: What are we going to do , take a taxi ?
SAMI: I 'm going to get some cigarettes .
FREDDY O: I ca n't believe someone would have the alls to rip off your ride .
RAPHAEL: When I find them they wo n't have them for much longer .
FREDDY O: I 'll ask around . If they try to move it I can find out .
RAPHAEL: Thanks .
AGENT HADLEY: I 'd like to see the manager please .
HOTEL MANAGER: May I help you ? Agent Hadley shows him his badge .
AGENT HADLEY: I 'm looking for several French men who checked in within the last twenty fou hours .
HOTEL MANAGER: They checked in last night .
AGENT HADLEY: I need you to take me to their room .

MAN: I most certainly will not go
OPERATOR'S VOICE: Operator .
SAMI: Room 912 .
DANIEL: Get that , will you ?
RAYMOND: Why do I always have to answer the phone ?
DANIEL: Because you 're the closest .
RAYMOND: I 'm not any closer than you are .
DANIEL: Why is everything an argument with you ?
RAYMOND: I 'm just setting my boundaries .
DANIEL: Hello ?
RAYMOND: Why do I have to pick up the tapes .
DANIEL: Jesus ! Daniel grabs the canvas bag .
AGENT HADLEY: You should go now .
LITTLE GIRL: C'mon , Mommy . Everything seems to move in slow motion . The Wiseguys go for their guns . The crew goes for theirs .
DANIEL: Let 's go ! The Crew moves through the door .
RAPHAEL: I ca n't eat .
HECTOR: So , can I have your fries ?
DANIEL: When we get back to Paris I 'll take you dancing .
ZERO: And the Vodka .
DANIEL: Cut his pants up the leg to the groin .
ZERO: And be careful when you get near the top . Zero has a very long one . He winks at Sami .
SAMI: What 's he joking around for ? He 's been shot .
DANIEL: He 's been shot a lot . He 's used to it .
SAMI: Anybody hungry ?
DANIEL: What 'd you get ?
SAMI: Some bread and
DANIEL: Cheese ? In a can ? Sami stuffs his mouth with a big bite .
SAMI: It 's good .
MARCEL: God , I want to go home .
SAMI: Hey , you know you ca n't this in France .
DANIEL: Thank God .
ZAMMITO: What happened ?
RAYMOND: The new Beaujolais ' come out in France next week . You like wine ?
SAMI: I 'm more of a whiskey drinker myself .
SAMI: Glenmorangie .
RAYMOND: Glenmorangie is very good .
SAMI: But I 'll have a glass of Beaujolais with you when we get back .
DANIEL: I 'll be back in an hour .
SAMI: What ?
DANIEL: Can I trust you , Sami ?
SAMI: Hey , who warned you that they were coming up to the room ?
DANIEL: If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back . That would have left us with nothing .
SAMI: No , that would have left me with nothing ecause all of you would be dead .
DANIEL: You have n't answered my question .
SAMI: Does it really matter what I say ?
DANIEL: I 'm leaving you with my friends . I 'm trusting you to do the right thing today .
SAMI: I will .
DANIEL: You better .
BONANNO: Either you are incredibly brave , o incredibly stupid . Which one is it ?
DANIEL: I guess we 're going to find out .
BONANNO: You rob an associate of mine a friend and
DANIEL: Not such a good friend . May I reach in my pocket ? Bonanno looks to Half Tooth Tony .
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: Of course . I need an answer from you if I 'm going to move .
MAN'S VOICE: We 're not just talkin ' about a 'piece of work ' here Frankie . We 're talking about a boss .
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: Bonanno 's a dinosaur .
DANIEL: I 've got to tell you , Mr. Bonanno , This guy 's an idiot . How he 's lived this long is a mystery .
BONANNO: I do n't think it will be a mystery much longer .
DANIEL: He 's recorded every conversation he 's had with you for years .
BONANNO: I assume you want something ?
DANIEL: We 've got a lot of people looking fo us . We 'd just like to go home .
BONANNO: You want me to help you get out of the country ? Daniel nods .
DANIEL: Half the tapes .
BONANNO: And the other half ?
DANIEL: I 'll destroy them when we get back to Paris .
BONANNO: I only have your word for that .
DANIEL: I just want to get my people home . I know who you are and what you could do to me if I do n't honor my word .
BONANNO: Where are you staying ?
DANIEL: How about if I call you ?
SAMI: Same place . One hour .
AGENT HADLEY: Hey , you 're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world . I took a shot . It did n't work . Did you bring the tapes ? Sami holds up the canvas bag .
SAMI: The lamp ?
AGENT HADLEY: Just a second . You must think I 'm a eal moron .
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: I just came by to tell that `` piece of work '' you asked for on Johnny Wicks It 's done .
BONANNO'S VOICE: Good . How 'd he go ?
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: Like the crying rat bastard that he was .
BONANNO'S VOICE: I made Peter Dimiano a congressman . We pay him each month to look after ou interests .
AGENT HADLEY: Here you go , sport .
LAMAR: I 'll take the bag .
AGENT HADLEY: You do n't think I see through this ? You tell Sami he 's dead .
LAMAR'S BUDDIES: C'mon , man ! Let 's get out of here .
SAMI: See , I told you that you could trust me . Daniel grins and pats him on the back .
LAMAR: Okay , we 're square now , right ?

LAMAR: I 'm listening .
DANIEL: Mr. Bonanno , I was wondering if you That would be fine . Thank you .

SAMI: Since we 're such good pals I thought I 'd sneak you an advanced copy of my latest work . I call it , `` I am a scum-sucking FBI agent '' .
AGENT HADLEY: I 'm going to retire with a shit-load of money . Find me a small country that does n't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life .
SAMI: You did n't have to kill Sophie .
AGENT HADLEY: Yes I did . Lose ends are messy .
SAMI: It 's a little arty I know , but it has great content , do n't you think ? You were so busy looking for a wire you probably did n't even think about a video camera . It was on the statue . Anyway , I 've sent a copy of the whole tape to the Chicago P.D . and the FBI . They 'll get it tomorrow . If I were you I 'd take the day off .
EDDIE: Hey boss , some guy named Hadley . Says he 's got some tapes you want ?

BASTALDI: Oh , Merde !
SAMI: Did you have to use that much explosive ?
DANIEL: I promised Bonanno I 'd destroy the tapes .
MARCEL: I 'm sorry ! I was caught up in the excitement of the moment . I should have checked . I made a mistake . I suppose that none of you have ever made a mistake efore ?
SAMI: This is great . After everything we 've een through we 've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball .
MARCEL: The baseball is mine .
SAMI: No ! You ca n't have the baseball ! You 're not entitled to the fuckin ' baseball !
MARCEL: I 'm the one who took it . It 's my aseball !
ZERO: If you say baseball one more time Zero will shoot you .
MARCEL: Raymond , do n't you think they 're ove eacting a little ?
RAYMOND: No . I think they have a right to express their anger with you in light of the fact that you 're
MARCEL: Fine . All of you want to be angry ? Be angry but I 'm the one who took the all and that makes it mine .

THUNK: It 's an avalanche of flavor . THE CROODS are eating like wild animals . They
GUY: Looks like we wo n't be having any leftovers .
EEP: What are `` left-overs ? ''
GUY: You know , when you have so much food to eat you have some , left over .
EEP: We never have that much food .
UGGA: Grug , how about a story ?
GRUG: That 's a good idea . How about a story huh ?
THUNK: Yeah a story , tell us a story ! Croods gather around Grug .
GRUG: Once upon a time there was a little tige who lived in a cave with her family . There were a lot of rules , but the big , simple one was to never leave the cave at night . And the door was so heavy , you 'd think it would be easy to remember .
THUNK: So easy to remember !
GRUG: I know ! But , while everyone was asleep , she went out anyway .
CROODS: No !
GRUG: Yes ! And no sooner than she did , he cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long , sucky walk , with some weirdo they met , and died ! The end .
GUY: Whoa ! I did not see that coming . Twist ending . My stories never end like that .
THUNK: Yes ! Two stories in one night !
GUY: Okay . But it wo n't be as good as Grug 's . Um , once upon a time , there was a eautiful tiger . She lived in a cave with the rest of her family . Her fathe and mother told her , `` You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff , fo you could fall . ''
GRUG: And die . Good story .
GUY: But when no one was looking , she would go near the cliff , for the closer she came to the edge , the more she could hear , the more she could see , the more she could feel . Finally , she stood at the very edge , and she saw a light . She leaned out to touch it , and slipped .
GRUG: And she fell .
GUY: And she flew .
CROODS: GASP
THUNK: Where did she fly ?
GUY: Tomorrow .
EEP: Tomorrow ?
GUY: A place with more suns in the sky than you can count .
THUNK: It would be so bright .
GUY: A place not like today , or yesterday , a place where things are better .
GRUG: Tomorrow is n't a place , you ca n't see it !
GUY: Oh yes , yes it is . I 've seen it . That 's where I 'm going .
GRUG: Well , WE are going to shut our eyes and sleep . And when we wake up we 're going to find the place that has everything we want .
EEP: Tomorrow ? !
GRUG: A cave .
GUY: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH .
GUY: That was too close . It almost caught us .
GRUG: I was watching . We were fine .
GUY: We 've got to move faster . Do you people have any other speed aside from `` wander ? '' I 'll take a shamble at this point .
EEP: Hey , do you have a minute ? How did the tiger fly ?
GUY: I only share when I 'm outside the log . I 'm funny that way .
EEP: Leave this to me .
SHRUGGING: Oops . Grug sees Guy has ROLLED away .

THUNK: You mean these rocks ? Ahh owww ! Do not step on these rocks !
GRAN: Step aside , girls ! Gran steps out , and then SCREAMS .
GRUG: Hello ? Nobody 's listening ! No one is listening . You can not walk on those ! Guy stands on the coral without flinching .

BELT: Eeccoomme on ! Belt walks Guy back to the Croods
GUY: I can help you , but we 're going to have to make a few changes around here . The log ride is over . Drop the log . Grug grudgingly DROPS the log .
GRUG: Okay , smart , Guy now what ? Guy SMILES .

GUY: Okay . Now you can look . Eep peers down at her new boots .
EEP: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh ! I love them ! Where are my feet ! ?

GRAN: Hah , I do n't get it .
GUY: Here you go , one for you , and this ones for you .
THUNK: Thanks .
GRUG: Okay . Okay . That 's enough . I do n't see why the kids need their own shells .
GUY: So if anyone gets in trouble , we can call the others .
GRUG: Wait you 're saying we should split up ?
GUY: We can try more paths at once . It 's the fastest way through .
GRUG: Croods stick together .
GUY: They can handle it .
EEP: We can do it , dad .
GRUG: No no no no no . It 's my job to keep you safe . I 'm still in charge and we are not splitting up . Except for you two . And that 's final . Grug SITS down like a silverback gorilla .

GRAN: It 's called desperation . Grug strokes his weird , fake rasta-hair .
GRUG: I call it a `` rug . '' Rhymes with Grug . And this one . I call it a `` ride . '' Rhymes with Grug . Grug regards a boulder as if it 's a Ferrari .

UGGA: Oh Grug , is that what this is all about ?
GRUG: And I also thought it would kill you mother . So you know ? Win win .

THUNK: Sorry , dad . Thunk joins the others . It 's the last straw .
EEP: You have to stop worrying for all of us .
GRUG: It 's my job to worry . It 's my job to follow the rules .
EEP: The rules do n't work out here .
GRUG: They kept us alive .
EEP: That was n't living , that was just , not dying . There 's a difference .
GRUG: Ugga , everyone , you have to listen to me . Ugga does n't move .
EEP: We would be dead if we listened you . Grug is STUNNED .
GRUG: Guy ?
UGGA: Guy , run . Grug lunges toward Guy , SCREAMING .
GRUG: AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! ! ! !

GRUG: I am a CAVEMAN .
GUY: No , no , no wait .
GRUG: Hnnnnnngh ! No . What is this stuff that saves you from my punches ?
GUY: Tar .
GRUG: No . I have to get back to them .
GUY: Grug ! Stop ! Grug looks to Guy .
GRUG: Your ?
GUY: Family . Yeah .
GRUG: Sorry .
GUY: I was little when it happened . The last thing my parents told me was , `` Do n't hide . Live . Follow the Sun . You 'll make it to Tomorrow . '' This resonates with Grug .
GRUG: You followed the light . My daughter is a lot like you .
GUY: No . She 's like you . She loves you but always forgets to say it . Just like you forget to tell her .
GRUG: I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive . Guy considers Grug .
GUY: It 's okay . That 's what Dads do .
GRUG: That 's right but we ca n't do that from here . We need one of your ideas . The music TURNS .
GUY: Belt ! Emergency Idea Generator , activate ! Belt hits Guy in the head with a rock .
THEN: I 've got it !
BELT: TA-DAAAAA
GRUG: Wow .

UGGA: We have to go back to the cave . Hurry , hurry , stay together . Let 's keep moving . Move , move ! Everybody hold my hand . Thunk let 's go . Go ! Let 's stay together .
GRUG: No more dark . No more hiding . No more caves .
UGGA: No . We do n't know what 's over there . Maybe nothing . It 's too risky .
GRUG: It 's a chance . Belt wipes a tear off his face .
GUY: I 'll take that chance . Grug LIFTS Guy above his head .
GRUG: You know , I 've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you .
GUY: Heh . That 's a joke , right ?
GRUG: What 's a joke ?
UGGA: He made it He made it

GRAN: No mush , just throw me . Grug LIFTS her above his head .
GRUG: Time to go .
EEP: No . I have too much to say to you . I need to fix everything and I do n't have time .
GRUG: I can fix it . Grug embraces Eep .
EEP: This works good . What do you call it ?
GRUG: I was thinking of calling it a Hug .
MORE: 84 . GRUG Because it rhymes with Grug . But you can change it if you want .
EEP: No . I like a `` Hug . ''
GRUG: I love you .
GRUG: Never be afraid .
GUY: There . I see him !
GRUG: Hey , I did it .
MACAWNIVORE: Erm ?
GRUG: Run !
GUY: It 's not safe here .
GRAN: I 'll tell her .
EEP: I never got to tell him . Ugga appeals to Eep .
UGGA: Eep , if your Dad were here , he would tell
THUNK: Wow , you sound just like him .
SANDY: Daddy !
EEP: He did it !
GUY: He 's riding the Sun but not very well . Everybody out of the way !
THUNK: Dad !
UGGA: Grug !
GRUG: Ahhh ! Where 's the danger ? Who blew thei shell ?
EEP: I love you too .
GRUG: One , two , three , four , five , six Grug puts his arm around Guy .

GRUG: Well , a boys got ta have a pet .
EEP: You really need to see this .
GRUG: We should go there .
THUNK: Let 's do that again . I think I blinked .
EEP: Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile . But now we know the Croods will make it .
EEP CONT'D: Because we changed the rules . The ones that kept us in the dark .
GRUG: Release the baby !
EEP: Well , sort of .
WORKER: Master Li is here !
AUNT WU: Shu Lien !
LI: How 's everything ?
AUNT WU: Fine . Please come in .
YU: Mu BaiIt 's been too long .
LI: It has . How 's business ?
YU: Good . And how are you ?
LI: Fine . An awkward pause .
YU: Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain . He said you were practicing deep meditation .
LI: Yes .
YU: The mountain must be so peaceful I envy you . My work keeps me so usy , I hardly get any rest .
LI: I left the training early .
YU: Why ? You 're a Wudan fighter . Training is everything .
LI: During my meditation training I came to a place of deep silence I was surrounded by light Time and space disappeared . I had come to a place my master had never told me about .
YU: You were enlightened ?
LI: No . I did n't feel the bliss of enlightenment . Instead I was surrounded by an endless sorrow . I could n't bear it . I broke off my meditation . I could n't go on . There was something pulling me ack .
YU: What was it ?
LI: Something I ca n't let go of . You are leaving soon ?
YU: We 're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking .
LI: Perhaps I could ask you to delive something to Sir Te for me .
YU: The Green Destiny Sword ? You 're giving it to Sir Te ?
LI: I am . He has always been ou greatest protector .
YU: I do n't understand . How can you part with it ? It has always been with you .
LI: Too many men have died at its edge . It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade .
YU: You use it justly , you 're worthy of it .
LI: It 's time for me to leave it behind .
YU: So what will you do now ? Li does n't reply .
LI: First I must visit my master 's grave . It 's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him . I have yet to avenge his death . And yet I 'm thinking of quitting . I must pray for his forgiveness .
YU: Join me once you have finished . I can wait for you in Peking .
LI: Perhaps .
GUARDS: Ok . Pass .
YU: Thanks . Let 's go into the city .
GIAO: Everything got here safely . I 'm much obliged .
YU: Just doing my job .
GIAO: Sun Security has been the best since your father started it . You 're a credit to his memory .
YU: Thank you .
GIAO: I mean it .
SIR TE: This is Li 's personal sword , a great hero 's weapon ! He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it . It 's too fine a gift . I can not accept it .
YU: Sir Te ! It has brought him as much trouble as glory . Help him to leave these troubles behind . Otherwise , he 'll never be able to start anew .
SIR TE: All right . I 'll act as the sword 's custodian . De Lu , the head servant , enters .
DE LU: Governor Yu has arrived .
SIR TE: I must change .
YU: You 've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me . Please accept ou thanks .
SIR TE: Please do not be such a stranger . You 'll stay the night as my guest . Now , Shu Lien tell me something . And forgive me for prying . You father was a great friend to me , and I think of you as my own daughter .
YU: Please , Sir Te , what is it ?
SIR TE: Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days maybe he 's trying to tell you something ?
YU: I do n't know
SIR TE: Do n't be coy . I 've always known about your feelings for each other . All these years , it 's a shame neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other . You 're both wasting precious time .
YU: I beg your pardon . Li Mu Bai and I are n't cowards .
SIR TE: When it comes to emotions , even great heroes can be idiots . Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him . I 'll give him an earful !
DE LU: Sir Te said to leave the sword in here .
JEN: I 'm your guest today . I am Governo Yu 's daughter .
DE LU: This is Sir Te 's study . You are here to
JEN: I was looking for a quiet corner .
DE LU: I am Sir Te 's head servant . And this is another of our guests .
JEN: It 's heavy for such a thin piece of metal !
YU: The handle is heavy . And the blade is no ordinary metal . Still , the sword is the lightest of weapons . You 're just not used to handling it .
JEN: But I have had much practice . As a child in the West , a platoon lived with us . They 'd let me play with their weapons . The scabbard is so eautiful .
YU: Beautiful but dangerous . Once you see it tainted with blood , its eauty is hard to admire . It 's 400 years old .
JEN: Exquisite ! You said it belongs to
YU: My friend Li Mu Bai . He 's given it to Sir Te as a gift .
JEN: Li Mu Bai ! The famous warrior ? Why would he give his sword to Si Te ?
YU: You 're too young to understand .
JEN: You 're a sword fighter too ?
YU: Yes , I am . But I prefer the machete . Certain moves , however , call for a sword .
JEN: Really ? Yu puts the sword back in the case .
YU: Fighters have rules too friendship , trust , integrity Without rules , we would n't survive for long .
JEN: I 've read all about people like you . Roaming wild , beating up anyone who gets in your way !
YU: Writers would n't sell many books if they told how it really is .
JEN: But you 're just like the characters in the stories .
YU: Sure . No place to bathe for days , sleeping in flea-infested beds They tell you all about that in those books ?
JEN: You know what I mean . I 'm getting married soon , but I have n't lived the life I want .
YU: So I heard . Congratulations . It 's the most important step in a woman 's life , is n't it ?
JEN: You 're not married , are you ?
YU: What do you think ?
JEN: No ! You could n't roam around freely if you were .
YU: You 're probably right .
SIR TE: Go ahead , Governor Yu .
GOVERNOR YU: Your knowledge is remarkable , Sir Te .
SIR TE: A sword by itself rules nothing . It comes alive only through skillful manipulation .
GOVERNOR YU: I see your point . Please continue .
SIR TE: The Imperial Court is n't the problem . With royalty and officials everywhere , the Royal Guard keeps security tight . But Peking is not like the West . Here , you 'll find all sorts of characters . Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order . Do n't depend only on the court . Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld can ensure you position . Be strong , yet supple . This is the way to rule .
MAID: Governess
GOVERNESS: Let me do it .
JEN: Please sit .
GOVERNESS: I 've made you silk pajamas . Do you want to change into them ?
JEN: Put them down .
GOVERNESS: I heard you met Shu Lien today .
JEN: Do you know her ?
GOVERNESS: She 's one of those . Your mothe would not want you consorting with her kind . Jen shoots her an angry look .
JEN: I 'll socialize with whomever I please .
GOVERNESS: Do n't invite danger into you father 's house .
JEN: I 'm tired now .
GOVERNESS: Go to bed then . Miss has grown up , and is getting married soon . God knows what the future will bring .
JEN: It will be just the same . Enough ! I 'm tired .
GOVERNESS: Autumn is coming . I 'll shut the windows for you .
MASTER BO: Chilly , eh ?
NIGHTMAN: Yes , Master Bo .
BO: Someone help ! Stop him ! He 's on the roof ! The sword 's been stolen ! Stop thief ! Stop him !
TSAI: It 's Jade Fox !
MAY: We must avenge mother !
BO: Do something ! He 's getting away !
YU: Return the sword , and I 'll let you go .
TSAI: You 're mistaken . We 're just street performers . We were rehearsing .
MAY: Father !
BO: You were rehearsing ? Who are you trying to fool ?
YU: Get down here ! Give back the sword !
DE LU: Sir Te awaits you .
BO: I 'm sure the thief is in the Yu household .
SIR TE: How dare you imply ?
BO: But I say
SIR TE: Enough .
YU: Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword ?
SIR TE: Yes , though I doubt he 's involved in this .
YU: But the sword could be in his compound .
SIR TE: Then someone 's trying to set him up . We should inform Li Mu Bai .
MADAM YU: What is it ?
MAID: Madam Yu , someone 's put up posters .
MADAM YU: Let me see .
GOVERNESS: Someone is after Jade Fox . Preposterous , looking for her here !
BO: Where are they ?
HOMELESS MAN: I do n't know . I have n't seen them in two days .
MAID: There is a Miss Shu Lien here to see you . Jen stops and looks up at them .
GOVERNESS: Miss is busy right now .
MAID: I 'll tell her .
JEN: Show her in . The governess shoots her a look .
GOVERNESS: This spells trouble .
JEN: I have a guest .
MAID: This way please .
JEN: I 've missed you .
YU: How so ?
JEN: I 'm bored . Yu sees the calligraphy .
YU: You 're doing calligraphy ?
JEN: I 'll write your name . Just for fun .
YU: I never realized my name looks like `` sword . '' Jen freezes slightly .
JEN: Maybe it is . I would n't know . The maid enters with tea .
YU: Thank you for seeing me . I hea your wedding day is near . You must e overwhelmed by the preparations .
JEN: I 'm hardly doing a thing . The less I think of it the better . My parents are arranging everything . The Gous are a very powerful family . My marrying one will be good for my father 's career .
YU: You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family .
JEN: Am I ? I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read . Like you and Li Mu Bai . I guess I 'm happy to be marrying . But to be free to live my own life , to choose whom I love That is true happiness .
YU: Do you think so ? Let me tell you a story .
JEN: About you and Li Mu Bai ?
YU: Yes . Did you know I was once engaged to be married ?
JEN: No , really ?
YU: His name was Meng Si Zhao . He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath . One day , while in battle , he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai 's enemy . After , Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together . Ou feelings for each other grew stronger . But how could we dishono Meng 's memory ? So the freedom you talk about , I too desire it . But I have never tasted it .
JEN: Too bad for Meng , but it 's not you fault , or Li Mu Bai 's .
YU: I am not an aristocrat , as you are but I must still respect a woman 's duties .
JEN: Do n't distance us . From now on , let 's be like sisters .
YU: Then as a sister , let me wish you happiness in your marriage .
MADAM YU: What a godforsaken place ! Ca n't your father be appointed closer to civilization ? Jen are you listening to me ?
TSAI: Let 's go !
BO: Wait ! I 'm a friend ! Tsai pauses .
TSAI: I do n't care about your sword .
BO: Why were you spying on the Yus ?
TSAI: I 'm looking for someone . Jade Fox . I 'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi , Gen Su district . Jade Fox is a master criminal . I hear she infiltrated the Yus . She must have come with them when they transferred here . But with Yu 's reputation , I ca n't just go in and accuse her .
BO: This Jade Fox is a woman ?
TSAI: Yes .
BO: Then leave her to me .
TSAI: Pardon me , but I doubt you can handle her . My wife was quite a martial arts expert . Jade Fox killed her . So you see , this is personal . Leave her to me .
MAY: It 's ready !
BO: I 'm ready for anything !
MAY: Father gets first dip .
TSAI: They 're gone .
MAY: What does it say ?
TSAI: `` We 'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill . '' Good , the fox is out of her hole .
SIR TE: Shu Lien , look who 's here . The man turns around it 's Li Mu Bai .
LI: Sir Te believes it 's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu .
YU: But something is going on at the Yu household .
LI: What have you discovered ?
YU: You always suspected she 'd fled to the West .
LI: I did n't think she 'd dare come back to Peking !
YU: Is there any place safer than unde the nose of Governor Yu ?
LI: So I shall avenge my master 's death after all .
YU: Be careful . Sir Te requires discretion . Official business is difficult enough . Do n't let personal feelings make it worse . And I do n't know even this poster could be some sort of trap .
LI: Did you see who posted it ? Yu pauses .
YU: No .
LI: It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu 's . On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu 's . Were you involved ?
YU: It was Bo , Sir Te 's man . I hear he followed the thief to the Yus ' .
LI: Have you questioned him yet ?
YU: No , not yet
LI: But your men are watching over Yu 's compund ?
YU: No , I 'd already sent them home . You can blame me for losing the sword , but please trust that I 'll get it back soon using my own methods .
LI: That 's not what I meant . I do n't care about the sword .
YU: What do you mean ? Did n't you come ack here for it ?
LI: I do n't know it was stolen until I got here .
YU: Then , why did you come ?
LI: Well , we had talked De Lu enters .
DE LU: Pardon my intrusion . Master Li , your room is ready .
LI: Thank you . Please lead the way .
BO: The fox does n't care much fo punctuality . Still no sign of her .
TSAI: Enough ! Show yourself .
FOX: Tsai you dog ! You will pay fo your stubbornness .
BO: That 's what you think , old witch !
TSAI: If you surrender now , you 'll suffe less . But if you resist , I wo n't stop until you 're dead .
MAY: Father ! Let me avenge my mother 's death .
FOX: You 'll soon end up like her , you little whore !
BO: You 'll pay for that !
TSAI: She 's going to paralyze you !
FOX: Tsai , you filthy mongrel ! An ambush !
MAY: Father , are you all right ? Li addresses Fox .
LI: Wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago . It 's been a long time , Jade Fox ! You do n't remember me But you should remember my master . You infiltrated Wudan while I was away . You stole our master ! Now it 's time for you to pay !
FOX: Your master underestimated us women . Sure , he 'd sleep with me , but he would never teach me . He deserved to die by a woman 's hand !
LI: You stole the secrets of Wudan 's highest martial arts . But afte ten years of training , your moves are still undisciplined . And today , under a Wudan sword you will die ! Li easily brings Fox to the ground .
FOX: Disciple , we 'll kill them all !
BO: Another one !
FOX: I must get rid of Tsai !
LI: Who are you ? Why is the Green Destiny in your possession ?
FOX: We must kill them !
MAY: Father !
TE: This is Tsai ?
MAY: My father . Police Inspector from Shaan .
TE: This should be reported to Governo Yu . The victim is an officer . You elieve the killer is hiding out in his compound .
YU: I 'd bet my life on it !
TE: Come with me . He exits the room .
SIR TE: This needs to be resolved , and quickly .
LI: I 'll get into the Yu household and get her . I 'll ferret out Fox and her gang .
YU: We must be careful . Governor Yu is a court official , and in charge of security . Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him . It might get Sir Te in trouble .
SIR TE: This is a delicate matter .
YU: Sir Te , can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter ?
SIR TE: What do you have in mind ?
YU: The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs . Sir Te and Li look puzzled .
MADAM YU: Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts . She 's eing so considerate .
YU: I 'm sorry she 's not feeling well enough to receive you today .
MADAM YU: I heard Sir Te lost something . And now Madame Te 's not feeling well Jen sits silently reading .
YU: We know who stole the missing item . If the thief returns it , I 'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further .
MADAM YU: That 's good . Sometimes the help ca n't keep their hands to themselves . It 's very embarassing .
YU: Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families .
MADAM YU: But do n't be too lenient .
YU: No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking .
MADAM YU: A murderer ?
YU: Yes . The very killer of Li Mu Bai 's own master . Last night , she killed a policeman who had tracked her down .
MADAM YU: A female criminal ! Now that 's news ! Jen becomes visibly upset .
JEN: You say she killed a policeman ?
YU: Yes , from the West . He went undercover and and followed he here ,
MADAM YU: Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same .
YU: I doubt it . This thief it very unusual
JEN: Greetings , Sir Te .
SIR TE: Hello , Madam Yu . This is Li Mu Bai , the renowned swordsman .
LI: Delighted to meet you . Li sizes Jen up .
TE: Miss Yu is soon to be married .
LI: Congratulations .
MAY: Why do n't you come in ?
BO: I 'm standing guard .
MAY: Come in . It 's cold .
LI: Is n't it a bit too late to be out ? You 've brought me the sword ?
FIGURE: I do as I please .
LI: Where 's your master ?
FIGURE: What 's it to you ? The figure floats away . Li chases after her .
LI: Had enough flying ? You 've got potential . You 've studied the Wudan Manual but you do n't understand it . You need a real master .
FIGURE: Do you think you are a real master ?
LI: Like most things , I am nothing . It 's the same for this sword . All of it is simply a state of mind .
FIGURE: Stop talking like a monk ! Just fight !
LI: Then tell me where Jade Fox is .
FIGURE: On guard !
LI: Real sharpness comes without effort .
FIGURE: Go ahead .
LI: Why should I ? You need practice . I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny , but first you must learn to hold it in stillness .
FIGURE: Why do you want to teach me ?
LI: I 've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan 's secrets .
FIGURE: And if I use them to kill you ?
LI: That 's a risk I 'm willing to take . Deep down , you 're good . Even Jade Fox could n't corrupt you . The figure 's eyes cloud with tears .
FIGURE: Wudan is a whorehouse ! Keep you lessons !
FOX: You 're home late or should I say early ?
JEN: Why are you still here ? You killed a policeman . You should leave ! You 'll bring ruin on my whole family .
FOX: They would n't have found me if you had n't stolen the sword . Like a little girl , you thought stealing would be fun ? You , too , are esponsible for that death . Come with me . You do n't want to waste your life as the wife of some ureaucrat . Denied your talent As a master and disciple we will ule .
JEN: I 'll never live as a thief !
FOX: You 're already a thief .
JEN: That was just for fun . How can I leave ? Where would I go ?
FOX: Wherever we want . We 'll get rid of anyone in our way . Even your father .
JEN: Shut up !
FOX: It 's the Giang Hu fighte lifestyle kill or be killed . Exciting , is n't it ?
JEN: I owe you nothing .
FOX: Yes , you do ! You are still my disciple .
JEN: You think you 've been teaching me all these years from the manual ? You could n't even decipher the symbols !
FOX: I studied the diagrams . But you hid the details !
JEN: You would n't have understood , even if I had tried to explain . You know you 've gone as far as you can go . I hid my skills so as not to hurt you .
FOX: If I had n't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai , I 'd still be ignorant of all you 've hidden from me .
JEN: Master I started learning from you in secret when I was 10 . You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu . But once I realized I could surpass you , I became so frightened ! Everything fell apart . I had no one to guide me , no one to learn from .
FOX: Believe me , I 've a lesson or two left to teach you ! Fox exits .
YU: The sword is back are you happy ? Li smiles .
LI: I admit , getting it back makes me ealize how much I 'd missed it .
YU: But it 's not your sword anymore . You gave it to Sir Te .
LI: True . But I must borrow it for one last mission . Jade Fox must die at its edge . Did you know what you were hiding when you covered fo that girl ?
YU: My job was to get the sword back , without embarassing anyone . I was n't about to ruin her life , o her father 's .
LI: You did your job well . But , this girl I saw her last night .
YU: I knew she would intrigue you .
LI: She needs direction and training .
YU: She 's an aristocrat 's daughter . She 's not one of us . In any case , it will all be over soon . You 'll kill Fox , and she 'll marry .
LI: That 's not for her . She should come to Wudan and become a disciple .
YU: But Wudan does not accept women .
LI: For her , they might make an exception . If not , I 'm afraid she 'll become a poisoned dragon .
YU: It 's not our affair . Even if Wudan accepts her , her husband might object .
LI: I thought by giving away the sword , I could escape the Giang Hu world . But the cycle of bloodshed continues .
YU: I wish there were something more I could do to help you .
LI: Just be patient with me , Shu Lien .
JEN: Lo ?
LO: Jen ! Lo grabs her by the wrist .
JEN: You should n't have come .
LO: With all the traffic on you ooftop these days it took me a while to get in here . I ca n't wait any longer . I was wrong to let you go . Come back with me . You 'll be happy in the desert . You 'll be free there .
JEN: You 've been looking for me all this time ?
MADAM YU: Jen stop playing with it .
JEN: I wo n't break it .
GUARD A: It 's Dark Cloud ! Dark Cloud is coming !
MADAM YU: Lower the shade , do n't let them see you !
LO: Let 's go !
JEN: Give it back !
LO: You 're tired . You need rest . You horse needs water . There 's a creek up here .
JEN: My comb !
LO: If you like that arrow , I can make you a bow . Great for hunting wild chicken . They 're delicious .
JEN: You coward !
LO: Still in a bad mood ? At least you 're speaking . What 's your name ? Jen spits at Lo .
JEN: It 's mine . It means a lot to me . A barbarian like you would n't understand .
LO: Not true . I can use it to pick fleas from my horse .
JEN: By the way , I 'm a real Manchurian .
LO: I 'm sorry I guessed wrong . I though you were a Han .
JEN: Give me back my comb .
LO: I do n't take orders from anyone .
JEN: Give it back .
LO: When I was a boy , one night , I saw a thousand shooting stars . I thought , where did they all go ? I 'm an orphan . I used to look fo stars alone . I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert , I 'd find them . I 've been riding in the desert ever since .
JEN: And so , the little boy became a fearsome bandit . He could n't find the stars , so he stole my comb . Lo pauses .
LO: Out here , you always fight fo survival . You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance . Slowly , your gang becomes your family . All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier .
JEN: So you 're still that little boy looking for shooting stars .
LO: I am a man . And now I 've found the ightest star of all .
JEN: Let them look .
LO: It is trouble for me . Jen bites her lip .
JEN: Do n't send me back !
LO: You must decide . You might get tired of this life . You might egin to miss your family . If it were our daughter , we 'd look fo her too . She would miss us . Jen I want you to be mine forever . I will make my mark on the world . I will earn your parents ' respect . We have a legend . Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain , God will grant his wish . Long ago , a young man 's parents were ill , so he jumped . He did n't die . He was n't even hurt . He floated away , fa away , never to return . He knew his wish had come true . If you believe , it will happen . The elders say , `` A faithful heart makes wishes come true . ''
JEN: Keep it safe . Return it to me when we are together again .
LO: I will .
JEN: If you do n't , I 'll come after you . And I wo n't let you off so easy .
LO: Wherever I went , someone always ecognized me . I really tried . Later , I heard you came to Peking . I was afraid I 'd never see you again . So I came . I ca n't let you marry .
JEN: Go .
LO: Jen
JEN: Do n't ever come back . Lo hovers at the window frame .
LO: So it 's over ? Jen pauses .
JEN: Yes . Lo thrusts a small object in her hand .
MAID: We heard noises .
JEN: It was just a cat .
YU: You think Jade Fox will show up ?
LI: She 's out there , but I doubt she 'll show herself . We 'll keep our eyes open . Sooner or later , she 'll come for the girl .
LO: Jen ! Come with me ! You 're mine ! Lo runs wildly into the crowd .
LI: Where is Jade Fox ? Yu jumps in and pushes Li away .
YU: Come with me ! Hurry !
LO: She 's mine .
LI: Either way , you are no good to he dead . With the Gou and Yu clans hunting you , you 'll soon be in their hands .
LO: I do n't care anymore .
LI: If you truly loved her , you would n't say that .
YU: Do n't you want to see her again .
LI: All right . I 'll write you an introduction . Take it to Wudan . Wait there for news from me .
LO: All right .
SIR TE: When will this end ? They take it , they put it back , they take it again . My home is turning into a warehouse . Bo bursts into the hall , bows to Te .
TE: Speak !
BO: Jen has run away ! Gou found the wedding chamber empty . Governor Yu equests your assistance . You know the Giang Hu underworld . He wants to find her , and keep her from harm .
LI: Sir Te , leave this to us . Do n't worry .
WAITRESS: What can I serve you ?
JEN: The cup is dirty .
GANGSTER A: Hello . What is your name ?
JEN: Long .
GANGSTER B: It 's young Master Long . My apologies . I 'm Iron Eagle Sung and this is my brother in arms , Flying Cougar Li Yun . What brings you to Huai An , and where are you headed , Master Long ?
JEN: Anywhere there 's action . The two men exchange glances .
GANGSTER A: In that case , perhaps we could be of assistance .
JEN: Do n't bother .
GANGSTER A: You do n't seem to understand .
JEN: So what if I do n't ?
GANGSTER B: We have ways of helping you understand .
GANGSTER A: Are you related to Li Mu Bai ?
JEN: He is my defeated foe !
YU: Have some tea .
LI: Shu Lien The things we touch have no permanence . My maste would say there is nothing we can hold on to in this world . Only y letting go can we truly possess what is real .
YU: Not everything is an illusion . My hand was n't that real ?
LI: Your hand , rough and callused from machete practice All this time , I 've never had the courage to touch it .
YU: To repress one 's feelings only makes them stronger .
LI: You 're right , but I do n't know what to do . I want to be with you just like this . It gives me a sense of peace . Li Mu Bai smiles .
WAITER: Please follow me .
JEN: I want a clean room .
WAITER: We have plenty . Your order ?
JEN: Steamed whole cod , bite-size meatballs , a little starchy , but keep the sauce light , shark fin soup , mixed vegetables , and some warm wine .
WAITER: I have to order from a bigge estaurant .
JEN: Hurry then .
MI BIAO: I am Iron Arm Mi . I heard a true master has arrived . I have come to seek a lesson . Jen ignores him .
JEN: What kind of Iron Arm are you ?
MONK JING: Hold it ! Do n't you know Monk Jing ?
JEN: A monk , in a place like this ? You need a lesson !
MONK JING: Who are you ?
JEN: Who am I ? I am I am the Invincible Sword Goddess . Armed with the Incredible Green Destiny . Be you Li or Southern Crane lower your head and ask for mercy . I am the desert dragon . I leave no trace . Today I fly ove Eu-Mei . Tomorrow I 'll kick ove Wudan Mountain !
MI BIAO: Her sword was just too powerful .
MONK JING: I 've traveled everywhere , but neve met anyone so uncivilized .
YU: Her husband . The men all nod their heads .
LI: We 're close to your headquarters . Go home and check in .
YU: What about you ?
LI: I 'll look around and catch up later .
YU: Not a bad idea . Tonight we 'll get a good night 's sleep at headquarters .
CAPTAIN: Fine . You 've been gone a while .
YU: Yes , and I leave again tomorrow . Your wife was due ?
AH WAI: Yeah , a baby girl .
YU: Good !
AH WAI: I 'll be happy if she 's half as strong as you .
YU: Mrs. Wu
AUNT WU: You 're back !
YU: How 's the arm ? Still sore ?
AUNT WU: Much better . You 've been gone so long .
YU: Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night .
AUNT WU: I 'll go and make up his room !
JEN: Sister Shu Lien
YU: Here you must be in proper attire .
JEN: I 'm just borrowing some clean clothes . I 'm not staying .
YU: I 'll give them to you .
JEN: I was just passing by and wondered how you were .
YU: Look at the trouble you 've caused . Now you know what Giang Hu life is eally like . If you think of me as your sister , let me give you some sisterly advice . You can run from marriage , but not your parents .
JEN: They forced me to marry !
YU: Go back to them first . Then you can decide about Lo .
JEN: You know about Lo ?
YU: He really loves you . Come back to Peking with me . We 'll find a solution .
JEN: Where is he now ?
YU: Li Mu Bai has made arrangements . He sent him to Wudan Mountain .
JEN: You 're working together to set me up ! I 'm leaving !
YU: How dare you accuse us ? I always knew you had stolen the sword ! I 've done nothing but protect you and your family . And you 're repaid me with nothing but contempt . Li Mu Bai himself spared you , and all you do is insult him . We wanted some peace and you 've ruined it all ! You 're no sister of mine !
JEN: What do I care ? You were never a eal friend anyway . But I wonder , how long could you last as my enemy ? Jen gets up to leave . Yu intercepts her .
YU: Put the sword down ! Jen jumps out .
JEN: Come and get it if you can .
YU: Without the Green Destiny , you are nothing .
JEN: Do n't be a sore loser . Go ahead . Take your pick . I 'll wait . Go ahead .
YU: Give me the sword .
JEN: Take it !
LI: Stop it ! You do n't deserve the Green Destiny .
JEN: Not another lecture ! On guard !
LI: Let 's end this here .
JEN: Only the sword will settle this .
LI: I only let you go because I wanted to see the real you .
JEN: What do you know about a true heart ?
LI: What I 've always wanted , to teach you .
JEN: All right . If you can take back the sword in three moves , I 'll go with you . Li takes the sword back .
LI: Kneel !
JEN: Never !
LI: Then you have no use for the sword . Li throws the sword into the rapids .
FOX: Sooner or later , they 'd drag you ack to Peking . Your parents will never accept you again . But why go home ? We 've gone this far , we wo n't stop now . You 'll always be my lady . At last , we 'll be our own masters . We 'll be happy . That 's the most important thing . All we have left is each other , right ? Lie down and rest . Jen is too weak to respond . Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny .
AUNT WU: She 's crazy . You should have killed her .
YU: I did n't have the heart .
AUNT WU: Well , Li Mu Bai can do it .
JEN: Is it me or the sword you want ?
LI: You 've been drugged !
YU: What happened ?
LI: Jade Fox drugged her . How did you get here ?
YU: We followed Jade Fox .
LI: And so you die . Li touches his neck .
FOX: And so shall you ! Li pulls a single needle from his neck .
YU: A poisoned needle !
FOX: You deserve to die , but the life I was hoping to take was Jen 's . Ten years I devoted to you . But you deceived me ! You hid the manual 's true meaning . I neve improved but your progress was limitless ! You know what poison is ? An eight-year-old girl , full of deceit . That 's poison ! Jen ! My only family my only enemy Jade Fox dies .
YU: You ca n't die ! Tell us what poison you used ! You ca n't die ! Tell us the antidote ! You ca n't let Li Mu Bai die !
JEN: She used Purple Yin Purple Yin poison . It goes straight to the heart .
LI: My blood will soon reverse its flow . It 's the same poison she used to kill my master . There is no antidote .
YU: That ca n't be ! Everything has an antithesis ! Why not this ?
JEN: The antidote exists . She taught it to me . The formula is simple , but it takes time to prepare . Trust me . As you have helped me , let me help you .
LI: All right . Hurry . I will hold on as long as I can .
YU: Take my horse and go to the compound . Give this to Mrs. Wu . She 'll help you . Hurry !
JEN: Spare your energy . I 'll be back !
AUNT WU: Stop it ! Jen pulls out Yu 's comb .
JEN: Shu Lien told me to show you this .
AUNT WU: Let her in .
YU: Mu Bai , hold on . Give me some hope
LI: Shu Lien
YU: Save your strength .
LI: My life is departing . I 've only one breath left .
YU: Use it to meditate . Free yourself from this world as you have been taught . Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath . Do not waste it for me .
LI: I 've already wasted my whole life . I want to tell you with my last eath I have always loved you . I would rather be a ghost , drifting y your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you . Because of your love I will never be a lonely spirit . Yu cries . She kisses him lightly . He closes his eyes .
JEN: He 's gone ? Bo peeks over Jen 's shoulder .
YU: Bo please take this sword back to Sir Te . He takes the sword from her .
JEN: Do you remember the legend of the young man ?
LO: `` A faithful heart makes wishes come true . ''
JEN: Make a wish , Lo . Lo pauses .
LO: To be back in the desert , togethe again .
JACK'S VOICE: Now he had become the still centre of that spinning wheel of misfortune .
GILES: Take a pew , Jack . You look well . What 's it been , two years since we oke bread ?
JACK: Three years , two months . March
GILES: What a memory you 've got . Maths always was your strong suit . What happened to the moaning Lisa ?
JACK: She went back to South Africa .
GILES: Did she ? You were pretty thick at one time .
JACK: We all played the field .
GILES: Hi-ya I 'll call you back . Now then
JACK: I want a job , Giles .
GILES: All right . As what ?
JACK: I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader . You employ readers , do n't you ?
GILES: We do . For unsolicited manuscripts . We pay twenty pounds a manuscript . You might get two , maybe three in a week . Can you live on sixty pounds ? JACK opens a pack of Gitanes .
JACK: Interesting , Giles . I will think about it .
GILES: Let me give you three words of advice , Jack . Do n't give up . Stick with it . Who persists wins . That 's my motto . Write , write , write .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack had three words for , Giles . Go fuck yourself .
MAN'S VOICE: Jacko , if you 're there , pick up . I want to talk to you . It 's important . JACK hesitates , then picks up .
JACK: Dad , I 'm here .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack knew something was wrong . He 'd forgotten Giles ' advice . Giles said three words .
DRUNK'S VOICE: I want to fuck the whole world over .
JACK'S VOICE: Welcome back Jack to the house of addiction .
REYNOLDS: David Reynolds , I 'm the Manage here . Sit down , John .
JACK: Jack . REYNOLDS examines a file in front of him .
REYNOLDS: You 've been recommended by the management here . They know you father . He has a bit of a eputation , has n't he ?
JACK: Has he ?
REYNOLDS: In any case , I understand you 've had some previous experience in South Africa . You 'll find the rules a little different here . Before we start , you have n't got a police record , have you ?
JACK: No .
REYNOLDS: Where did you go to school ?
JACK: I was at Beadles .
REYNOLDS: I do n't think I know that one . Private , I suppose .
JACK: Do you have a Salon Prive ?
REYNOLDS: We tried . But there was n't enough usiness . The punters like company . REYNOLDS goes to one of the tables with JACK .
JACK: I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond .
REYNOLDS: We check every four days .
JACK: Why four ? And not three or five ?
REYNOLDS: It 's the procedure here . Now sort the chips .
JACK: Stacks of 20 . Rows of 5 .
REYNOLDS: Any exceptions ?
JACK: 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours .
REYNOLDS: Give me 365 .
JACK: You use two alternating , do n't you ?
REYNOLDS: We do .
JACK: Where 's the magnet ?
REYNOLDS: They 've been tested .
JACK: No more bets .
REYNOLDS: Could you stop that for a minute ?
JACK: I 'm sorry , sir , I 've called no more bets .
REYNOLDS: Have n't you forgotten something ?
JACK: I do n't think so .
REYNOLDS: Wipe your hands . JACK takes out a handkerchief .
JACK: What happens if I want to sneeze ?
REYNOLDS: You wo n't . Not without permission .
JACK: Five .
REYNOLDS: I make it six .
JACK: Five . REYNOLDS looks down at the table .
REYNOLDS: What makes you so sure ?
JACK: It 's a rule . Always stand by you first count . The odds are you 're ight .
REYNOLDS: Good call . JACK pulls out the shoe .
JACK: You want me to check ?
REYNOLDS: I said good call .
JACK'S VOICE: It had taken him 45 minutes , but Jack now had Mr Reynolds 's number . The man could n't count .
REYNOLDS: Let me just run through a few things . As a dealer you neve gamble , not anywhere . We 'll need your picture .
JACK: What for ?
REYNOLDS: For the database . It can be accessed y every casino in the country . We have the same system for punters .
JACK: I do n't gamble .
REYNOLDS: Ever ?
JACK: I do n't gamble , Mr Reynolds . REYNOLDS does n't pursue it .
REYNOLDS: Next point . Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged . Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden .
JACK: We had the same rule at Sun City , ut it was impossible to check .
REYNOLDS: This is n't South Africa . We 'd know , ecause someone would report it . Believe me , someone always does .
JACK: Does know ? Or does report ? What would happen if I knew something like that and did n't report it ?
REYNOLDS: We 'd know . There are no secrets in this casino . You 'd be punished .
JACK: How ?
REYNOLDS: First offence verbal warning . Second offence written warning . That one 's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board . My discretion . Third offence you 're sacked on the spot . You 'd neve work in a casino in this country again . There 's another rule you 're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino . If you see someone who 's gambled here , even if it 's just casually on the street , you must ignore him . O her . You 're not married , are you ? JACK shakes his head
JACK: Yes .
REYNOLDS: She 's not in the gaming business is she ?
JACK: No .
REYNOLDS: This is our Crow 's Nest . I 'm showing it to you now , but you 'll neve see it again .
JACK: Very impressive .
REYNOLDS: We have tapes in here that go back six months . Let me show you something .
JACK: Fine .
REYNOLDS: That hair will have to go .
JACK: Fine . Pause .
REYNOLDS: Are you planning to make a caree in casino work ?
JACK'S VOICE: And end up like you ?
JACK: I just want the job .
REYNOLDS: Jack , you 're not the usual type we get here .
JACK'S VOICE: Mr Reynolds was right . It was true . Jack was up above the world . An artist , living in the clouds . Looking down .
REYNOLDS: Excuse me
JACK: Yes . What 's the salary ?
JACK'S VOICE: The casino paid its staff monthly in arrears . He would have to wait six weeks for his first cheque . He needed money now .
DEALER: What kind of deal you looking to ?
JACK: What 's the Blue Book price ?
DEALER: That 's not relevant . An old ca like this , it depends on the condition .
JACK'S VOICE: The car was a gift from Jack 's father . That 's to say , Jack Senio had given it to him before the ailiffs arrived .
DEALER: This ai n't exactly what you 'd call mint . He bends down and looks underneath the car .
JACK: How about fifteen hundred ?
DEALER: How about five hundred .
JACK: What ? !
DEALER: How about we split the diff Seven-fifty .
JACK: Is that your idea of arithmetic ?
DEALER: I 'm not a mathematician . I 'm in usiness .
JACK: Eight-fifty .
DEALER: Seven-fifty .
JACK'S VOICE: He suddenly wanted to be rid of it . 'Hang on tightly , let go lightly ' . It was a saying Jack emembered .
MARION: I could n't resist them .
JACK: You mean I wo n't resist them . JACK goes to her .
MARION: No , no . I 'm not ready for you . There 's some vodka in the freezer .
JACK: You want me drunk ?
MARION: I wo n't be that long .
JACK: You really are a beautiful woman .
MARION: It 's not just inner beauty , is it ?
JACK: Turn around . MARION whirls to show off her dress .
MARION: Where did you get it ?
JACK: I. sold the car .
MARION: You should n't have done that . I know what it meant to you .
JACK: I owe you for the rent . It 's only a car . I can get another .
MARION: Take it back . Till you sell you ook .
JACK: Come on , Marion . Let 's face the truth . Nobody 's going to publish it .
MARION: Of course they will . You just have to be patient . I 'm betting on you . She raises the glass of wine , drinks .
JACK: I 'm not much of a bet . He drains his glass .
MARION: You are to me .
JACK: I 've got something to tell you .
MARION: I want to hear it .
JACK: I 've got a job .
MARION: What job ?
JACK: In a casino . As a croupier . A dealer .
MARION: How did you land that ?
JACK: It came my way . 450 a week .
MARION: 450 ? What did you do , just walked in and said I want to be a croupier ? Do n't you need training ?
JACK: I had training . In the Republic .
MARION: You were a croupier there ? You never told me that . I thought you just knew some gamblers .
JACK: I start Monday week .
MARION: 450 a week . I 've never earned that in my life . You 're an enigma , you are . A fucking enigma .
JACK'S VOICE: Not an enigma , just a contradiction . MARION looks deeply into his eyes .
MARION: You sold the car . You got a job . What 's the third thing ? Tell me .
JACK: There 's no third thing . Do n't be superstitious .
MARION: I love you Jack , you know that .
JACK'S VOICE: And he half-loved Marion . And she knew that too .
JACK: Are you trying to read my palm ?
MARION: You 've got such beautiful hands .
JACK'S VOICE: The hands of a conjuror , a woman had told him once . Or a card sharp .
MANICURIST: What line of work are you in ?
JACK: I 'm an undertaker .
MANICURIST: Really ?
BARBER: Do you work round here ?
JACK: My office is in Shanghai .
BARBER: What do you do ?
JACK: I 'm an arms dealer . The BARBER stops for a moment , nonplussed .
BELLA: I 'm Bella .
JACK: Jack Manfred .
BELLA: Hi , Jack . Welcome to the cesspit .
JACK: Is it that bad ?
BELLA: How do I look ?
JACK'S VOICE: Like trouble , Bella . You look fine .
BELLA: The punters love it . Tits in uniform . She laughs .
JACK'S VOICE: The usual bunch . They did n't know Jack , but he knew them .
JACK: Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . A fat INDIAN PUNTER addresses JACK .
INDIAN: Where 's the other fellow ? Where 's Geoff ?
JACK: He does n't work here any more .
INDIAN: Well , let 's hope you know you job .
WOMAN: Tens , please .
WOMAN 2: Perhaps this man will bring us luck .
WOMAN: What 's that aftershave you 're wearing ?
JACK'S VOICE: Never converse with the punters . It slows things down . Speed is volume , and volume is profit fo the casino . Aim at twenty spins an hour .
JACK: Last bets , please .
MAN: You 're new here . You 'll get used to Madame Claude . She comes in once or twice a week and does that . JACK nods .
JACK'S VOICE: He knew the scam . Come in with five grand cash . No questions asked . Launder it by getting a casino cheque when you cash in . Jack wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted it ? After all there 's was no profit in it for the casino . Or was there ?
JACK: Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen . I 'm going to hand you over now to my colleague . Goodnight . MATT takes over .
MATT: Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . REYNOLDS appears and takes JACK 'S arm .
REYNOLDS: Good work , Jack . You handled yourself well . At the table , MATT glances at the GREEK man .
JACK'S VOICE: Suddenly a delayed wave of elation came over him .
REYNOLDS: Why do n't you take a break , Jack .
JACK: All right , Mr Reynolds .
BELLA: Good evening , Mr Tchai .
MR TCHAI: Good evening .
REYNOLDS: Enjoy yourself , Mr Tchai . REYNOLDS waves to a WAITRESS who comes over .
WAITRESS: Your usual , sir ? TCHAI nods . He hands her a £50 note .
JACK'S VOICE: £50 for a diet Coke . Waitresses were the true winners in the casino . They were the only members of staff allowed to accept tips . On a good night they could get between £200 and £300 .
REYNOLDS: Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table , and only with Bella .
JACK: Does he win ?
REYNOLDS: He 's a good customer .
JACK'S VOICE: A good customer is a consistent loser . Was that what Mr Reynolds meant ?
MATT: Where do you live , Jack ?
JACK: Over the river .
MATT: Have you got transport ? JACK shakes his head .
JACK: Thanks .
MATT: So how do you feel , your first night ? I 'll bet you 're on a high .
JACK: Nice car .
MATT: She 's my baby .
JACK: How long have you worked at the casino ?
MATT: Coming up to two years now . But I was away for six months .
JACK: You 've done pretty well .
MATT: Not bad . I have other interests , of course . MATT spins the car round a corner .
JACK: No thanks , Matt . I need my eight hours .
MATT: I 'll lay you five to one you wo n't sleep . In this job you have to unwind . Otherwise it 'll kill you . I mean that .
JACK: Some other time .
MARION: What 's the time ?
JACK: I do n't know . Clock beside the bed reads 4.30 .
MARION: How did it go ?
JACK: Fine .
MARION: You 're shaking . What is it ?
JACK: Tension . It 'll go .
MARION: Poor baby . This 'll relax you . She starts to massage his neck , his hair .
JACK: It 's only hair . I have n't changed .
MARION: When you get home , I 'm asleep . When I leave home , you 're asleep .
JACK: I 'll see you in my dreams .
JANI: In 20s , please
JACK: Place your bets .
JANI: 5811 .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack could see this woman was an experienced gambler . Professionals always place their bets through the croupier . That way there are no comebacks .
JACK: I 'm sorry , sir , that 's a late bet .
MAN: What are you talking about ? It 's 11 , I 've won . With this lady .
JACK: You 've won with the two chips you placed earlier , but the third chip was a late bet .
MAN: I put them on together .
JACK: I 'm afraid that 's not so , sir .
MAN: Now look here , you
REYNOLDS: Is there a problem , sir ?
MAN: Yes . This croupier is accusing me of cheating .
JACK: It was a late bet . This gentleman has been following the lady 's numbers and
MAN: Do you think I cheated ? JACK and REYNOLDS wait . JACK glances at JANI .
JANI: In my opinion it was a late et .
REYNOLDS: I think we should talk about this , sir . Away from the table .
MAN: No . I won . I want to be paid .
REYNOLDS: Pay the gentleman . In full .
JACK: I 'm sorry , madam , we do n't accept gratuities in the UK . It 's different in South Africa .
JANI: You know where I 'm from ? JACK nods and gives her back the two chips .
JACK: I 've lived there .
JANI: Well , thank you anyway . JACK watches her leave .
JACK'S VOICE: Bright woman , he thought . She knew the rule of gold . Quit when you 're ahead .
JACK: Place your bets .
MATT: What the fuck are you talking about ?
JACK: That Greek guy who won at the end . You paid him out in 25s not 20s .
MATT: I do n't cheat , Jack . You 've got it wrong .
JACK: I 'm not going to report it .
MATT: What are you , a cop ?
JACK: If I see you do it again , I 'll eport it .
MATT: I do n't get you . Even if it was true , which it is n't , what the fuck difference would it make to you ?
JACK: Because if a supervisor knew I 'd seen you and I had n't reported it , I 'd lose my job as well . And I ca n't afford that .
MATT: So it 's Mr Clean . Wise up , Jack , this whole business is bent . The casino is nothing but legal theft . And that 's OK . It 's the system . Half the punters who come in are using stolen money , drug money , they have n't earned it . We earn our money . I 'm on your side , Jack . I do n't need an enemy .
JACK: You 're talking about complicity .
MATT: I do n't know what that means . I 'm talking about not rocking the boat .
JACK'S VOICE: Matt was an escape artist . Like Jack 's father .
MATT: Hey , Andros !
JACK: Who are these guys ?
MATT: Mostly people in the casino usiness . A few drug dealers .
JACK: And the girls ?
MATT: Just girls . What are you drinking ?
JACK: Vodka . Straight . On the rocks .
MATT: Good call . Help yourself .
JACK: Does Bella come here ?
MATT: That bitch ? No .
JACK: No thanks .
MATT: Do n't worry , I wo n't report you !
JACK: I do n't gamble . GIRL appears behind JACK 's shoulder .
GIRL: You do n't gamble , but do you smoke ?
JACK: Sometimes .
GIRL: How about now ?
JACK'S VOICE: Marion . I 'm on my way
JACK: I 'm off . I need to sleep .
MATT: Loosen up , Jack . If you do n't , this job 'll get to you . The pressure 's too much , believe me , it 'll break you .
JACK: `` The world breaks everyone , and afterwards many are strong in the oken places . '' Ernest Hemingway .
MATT: Was n't he the one who shot himself ?
MARION: Where 've you been ? I 've got to give evidence in court at nine .
JACK: Do n't play the cop with me , Marion .
MARION: Take that back ! Fucking take that back . I 'm not a cop any more .
JACK: I take it back . You 're not a cop any more . You 're a store detective .
MARION: Are you drunk ?
JACK: Probably .
MARION: This fucking job 's getting to you . You have n't written a fucking word since you started .
JACK: Do you have to swear all the time ?
MARION: Well , that 's my poor upbringing . I did n't go to no private school . I have n't got no class . I want to live with a writer . Not a fucking croupier . I do n't even know what the word means . Croupier .
JACK: Marion , stop this .
MARION: What do I mean to you ? I want to know . Tell me . There is a pause .
JACK: You 're my conscience .
MARION: Have n't you got a conscience of your own ?
JACK: What about a drink on the way home ?
MARION: I do n't finish till eight . Make it nine and you 're on .
JACK: I 'm on at nine .
MARION: Well , that 's our life now , is n't it ?
JANI: Thinking of going back ?
JACK: Oh hello .
JANI: You know what ? I 'd like to buy you a drink .
JACK: It 's against the rules . Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters .
JANI: That 's stupid . What are the odds of you being seen with me ?
JACK: Impossible to calculate .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack knew that , in reality , all odds are calculable .
JANI: To coincidence .
JACK: There 's a casino in this hotel .
JANI: I 'm not much of a gambler really . I just like this bar .
JACK: So why did you come to my casino ?
JANI: I was at a loose end . A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership .
JACK: First visit to London ?
JANI: No , no . I come every couple of years . I always think I 'm going to stay . I 'm from Cape Town originally
JACK: I was born in the Transkei , on the Wild Coast .
JANI: Near the casino .
JACK: In the casino .
JANI: Now there 's a coincidence . My fathe used to gamble there .
JACK: Your father ?
JANI: I loved the atmosphere . But it destroyed my poor mother .
JACK: The debts .
JANI: And the lies . Gamblers are born liars .
JACK: And superstitious too . It 's like witchcraft .
JANI: That 's Africa . There 's an African in all of us , is n't there ?
JACK: We all came from Africa , supposedly .
JANI: Do you believe in astrology ?
JACK: Absolutely not . But then , I 'm a Gemini and Geminis do n't believe in astrology . JANI laughs out loud .
JANI: You know , you do n't strike me as a typical croupier .
JACK: Absolutely not .
JANI: Toss you for it .
JACK: I do n't gamble .
JANI: I know this is verboten , but if you feel like a chat or maybe dinner , give me a call .
JACK'S VOICE: He did n't know why , but he 'd started to dress for the casino at home
WOMAN: Animal !
JACK: Would you mind being more careful , sir .
MAN: I 've got 'flu . He coughs again , but into a handkerchief .
WOMAN: Then go back home . To the zoo !
JACK: This gentleman accidentally coughed onto these chips . I do n't think it would be hygienic to stack them The SUPERVISOR signals a WAITRESS over .
SUPERVISOR: Agnes . These chips have to be counted and put into the steamer .
AGNES: Yuck .
MATT: I ca n't give you a lift back tonight .
JACK: Do n't worry . REYNOLDS places the notes in steel boxes .
BELLA: Jack . Do you need a ride ?
JACK: No . Thanks .
BELLA: My car 's in the garage .
JACK: Maybe another time .
BELLA: I 'll take you up on that .
JACK: Goodnight .
MAN: You do n't recognise me ? You had me arred . You fucking little worm .
JACK: Wait a minute . You got yourself arred .
MAN: It was you , you shit .
JACK: Now I 'm going to kill you .
BELLA: Jack !
JACK: He wo n't cheat again .
BELLA: You 're shaking .
JACK: It 's the tension .
BELLA: Excuse the mess .
JACK: I hate cheats .
BELLA: All men are cheats .
JACK: Why did you quit ?
BELLA: I got scared .
JACK: I can imagine .
BELLA: Can you ? I 'm happy being a dealer . At least the punters keep thei hands to themselves .
JACK: You called the casino a cesspit .
BELLA: Well it is . But I know where I am . JACK hands the joint back to BELLA .
JACK: I despise the job .
BELLA: Ah , we all say that . But if we hate it , why do we do it ? JACK does n't answer .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack wanted to say we do it fo the money . But that was n't really true .
BELLA: What do you really want to do ? She puts the joint in an ashtray .
JACK: The Indian rope-trick .
BELLA: Look , now I 'm pumping you . I 'm sorry . It 's none of my business . It 's just that you 're not like the others .
JACK: Not like Matt , you mean .
BELLA: Now he 's a real shit . Do n't get friendly with him . I 'm sure he 's got his hand in the till . You know what he said to me once ? `` I want to fuck the whole world over . That 's my mission . '' The shit ! BELLA touches a bruise on JACK 'S body .
JACK: Ouch .
BELLA: Sorry .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack could hear Matt saying it
MATT: I look like shit . JACK is scrubbing his nails at a basin .
JACK: Rough day ?
MATT: Rough life , Jack .
PAT: Hi . I 'm Pat .
JACK: What happened to Bella ?
MATT: I 'll tell you later . JACK is mystified .
MR TCHAI: What happened to Bella ?
JACK: She was re-assigned .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack knew this was no coincidence . Why had she come ?
JANI: One thousand even . In fifties .
JACK'S VOICE: He wondered if she believed he would bring her luck
JANI: In fifties . The MEN at the table look at JANI .
JACK'S VOICE: Or did she think he would help he win ?
JANI: Good night . Thank you . She walks away from the table .
JACK: Good night .
JACK'S VOICE: Thank you , she said . For what , Jack thought . Jani de Villiers knew the odds . TCHAI looks at JACK .
MR TCHAI: Pretty woman .
JACK: Hello
JACK SR: How 's it going , Jacko ? INTERCUT between JACK and JACK SR .
JACK: Fine . I took the job .
JACKSR: Good for you . I was wondering what happened .
JACK: I tried to call you , dad , but they said your line was disconnected .
JACK SR: Ah yes , I moved house . Needed a igger place . How 's that book of yours coming along ?
JACK: I 'm getting there .
JACK SR: It 's good to have the job to fall ack on , is n't it ? There goes my other phone .
JACK: Goodbye dad .
MARION: I do n't like it .
JACK: Why not ?
MARION: I do n't like it at all . You had a wonderful character before , the Gambler . He was so romantic .
JACK: He was a loser . This guy 's a croupier . He ca n't lose . People have shat on him all his life . Now he 's in control . He 's a winner .
MARION: Is that your idea of a winner ? He does n't give a shit about anyone . He uses people and
JACK: It 's because of the sex , is n't it ? You do n't like the sex in it .
MARION: I do n't give a fuck about the sex . Most men 'll fuck a lamppost . He 's just a miserable zombie . Is that the way you feel now ? Is that what 's happened to you ?
JACK: Marion . It 's a book .
MARION: Oh really . Then why is he called Jake . Why do n't you come clean and call him Jack . There 's no hope in it .
JACK: It 's the truth .
MARION: Without hope there 's no point to anything .
JACK: Now wait a minute . What 's so hopeful about your job ? Spending the day catching poor people stealing . You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it . At least in the casino everybody gets caught . Rich or poor , the odds are the same . It 's all relative .
MARION: Crap . It 's not relative . It 's unfair . Like your casino . It 's designed unfair . And your croupier 's a little shit because he goes along with it .
JACK: You 're just like all those othe dummies out there . Fourteen and a half million to one ! Is that you idea of hope ? The doorbell rings again .
MARION: The door , Jack .
JACK: Leave it .
MARION: No . Answer it !
BELLA: You fucking little shit ! You shopped me .
JACK: What are you talking about ? MARION watches , numb .
BELLA: Reynolds got a doctor in . They forced me to take a dope test . It was positive . As you knew .
JACK: I do n't know anything about it . BELLA looks over to MARION .
BELLA: Your boyfriend fucked me , smoked my dope , then shopped me . What do you think of that ? I ca n't get a job now . You bastard . You 're no different from Matt . A pair of vicious little shits , that 's what you are .
JACK: Look Bella , I do n't know anything about this . You should talk to Matt .
BELLA: You 're all scumbags .
MARION: I agree .
JACK: Bella !
MARION: Go on . Go after her !
JACK'S VOICE: Jack had no idea where Marion was staying , or with whom . He realised he knew little about her life . But then , he had never asked about it .
JACK: He 's paying out in stacks of 25 .
REYNOLDS: I can see .
JACK'S VOICE: Chapter Three . His existence was forming an interesting pattern of etrayals . Sometimes he was unsure whether he was the betrayer or the etrayed . REYNOLDS looks up from the screen .
REYNOLDS: Thanks for the information .
JACK: A pleasure . Pity about Bella .
REYNOLDS: She was a real asset . But what could I do ? JACK lights a cigarette .
GILES: Jack !
JACK: I 'm working on that soccer story .
GILES: Right . Look , I must get back to Habib .
JACK: Habib ?
GILES: My author . He 's a Terrorist . He 's written a kill-and-tell book . Take care .
JACK: I 'll try and make it .
GILES: Looking forward !
JACK'S VOICE: Books piled like chips . Stack 'em high . Sell 'em fast . Make a killing . You think you 're a gambler , Giles , ut you 're not . You 're a dealer . A camera flash .
JACK: I do n't know how you can drive at night with those glasses .
JANI: Just an accident . Nothing .
JACK: Turn left ahead . The car turns into a lane .
JANI: That 's fine .
GILES: She 's a dab hand With a racquet , your friend .
JACK: South African women are very sporty .
GILES: I can see . How did she get that shiner ? JACK has been waiting for this .
JACK: I found her in bed with someone .
GILES: Who was he ?
JACK: She .
GIEES: I say . You 're a dark horse , Jack .
GORDON: You do n't play tennis ?
JACK: I do n't play anything .
GORDON: How boring for you .
FIONA: Where 's our drinks ?
CHLOE: They 're so bloody selfish .
JANI: I 'm so glad you brought me .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack would n't have come without her .
JACK: I do n't gamble .
GILES: Do n't be a spoilsport . It 's only a few quid .
JACK: It 's nothing to do with money . I do n't gamble . GILES looks to JANI to persuade him .
JANI: He does n't gamble .
JACK: I 'll watch .
GORDON: Jack likes to watch . Does he like to watch ? JACK is getting angry . JANI is calm .
JANI: One more remark like that and I 'll eak your balls .
GILES: I 'll bet she could , too . JACK defuses the atmosphere .
JACK: I 'll deal , but I wo n't play . He sits down , picks up the cards .
GORDON: You sure you know how ?
FIONA: Do that again .
CHLOE: That 's sexy .
FIONA: Do n't they look pretty . They all pick up their cards .
GILES: There 's nothing pretty about this hand .
CHLOE: You 're not supposed to talk , Giles .
FIONA: He 's probably lying . He does that . JACK catches JANI 's eye . She winks .
JACK: Last hand .
GILES: Hey . I 've got an idea . Why do n't we
FIONA: No ! No stripping .
CHLOE: Right . We 're not having that again ! Although
GORDON: I 'll stick to bluffing . That 's what I 'm best at .
FIONA: Two cards .
GILES: One card .
CHLOE: Oh I do n't knowErtwo cards .
JANI: Three cards .
FIONA: That 's it . I have n't got any more cash .
GORDON: Beat that . CHLOE turns over a Flush .
CHLOE: Ha . Ha . Ha .
GORDON: Shit . FIONA turns over a Full House .
FIONA: Not so fast , darling .
GORDON: Hang on , chaps . That 's impossible ! GILES turns over four of a kind .
GILES: How 's about that for impossible . Laughter , cries of amazement .
GORDON: What 's going on ?
CHLOE: Wow . What are the odds for this happening ? More laughter , cries of amazement .
FIONA: Thousands to one .
JACK: 42,300,000 to 1 .
JANI: Approximately .
GORDON: I could 've won if I 'd been able to luff .
GILES: I get it .
JACK: Get what ? Are you accusing me of cheating ?
GILES: Good God , no . But with skill like that , what do you want a job for ? You do n't need to work .
JACK'S VOICE: Here was an interesting question . Was writing work or play ?
JANI: What happened ?
JACK: Remember the guy who cheated at the table ?
JANI: You do n't like cheats , do you .
JACK: You choose . They get into bed .
JANI: That trick tonight , I do n't think I 've ever seen that before .
JACK: It can only work with amateurs , A pro would have spotted it .
JANI: I did n't .
JACK: Then you 're not a pro .
JANI: Goodnight .
JANI'S VOICE: Jack ? I need your help JACK wakes drowsily .
JANI: I 'm in trouble .
JACK: What kind of trouble ?
JANI: I owe a lot of money .
JACK: Was that why you did the two grand ? I could n't help you .
JANI: I know that . But you can now .
JACK: I do n't have any money . switches on the light . JANI is looking distressed .
JANI: Some people I know , they 're planning to rob The Golden Lion . JACK sits up , turns on the lamp .
JACK: You do n't mean that . JANI pulls up the bedcover around her body .
JANI: They mean it .
JACK: Who 's they ?
JANI: My creditors . One night , around three in the morning , they 'll come into the casino -
JACK: Forget it , Jani . It 'll never work .
JANI: The point is , they want a man inside .
JACK: And I thought you were a bright woman .
JANI: Just listen . You do n't have to do anything criminal .
JACK: Robbery 's not criminal ? JACK gets out of bed , tours the room .
JANI: You do n't have to be criminal . A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat . You 'll see him , stop him , and the guy will make a big scene . There 'll be chaos . And that 's when it 'll happen .
JACK: You 're serious .
JANI: You wo n't be committing a crime . The man will cheat , you 'll just be doing your job , that 's all . JACK comes right up close to JANI in bed .
JACK: And I thought you were only afte my body .
JANI: I 've come to know you . You 're honest . I trust you .
JACK: What 'll you do when it all goes wrong ?
JANI: It wo n't .
JACK: But if it does .
JANI: You keep the ten thousand pounds .
JACK: What ten thousand pounds ? JANI gets out of bed .
JANI: These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after . They want someone they can e sure of , an honest dealer . That 's the point . Not all dealers are honest . Mr Reynolds will neve suspect you .
JACK: Reynolds ? You 've done your research . She puts her hand on his .
JANI: I did n't know what else to do . You 're my last chance .
JACK: What about my neck ?
JANI: I want to go back to Cape Town , I want to start again , clean .
JACK: I ca n't do it , Jani .
JANI: I 'm asking you , as afriend . You 'd be saving the life of a friend .
JACK'S VOICE: Jack wondered why he was even considering it . Ten grand . In cash . That was why . But Jack did n't need the money . His father would have taken it , like a shot . But his father was a gambler . He downs his drink , and leaves the kitchen .
JANI: I want you to forget what I said .
JACK: Wait a minute
JANI: No , forget it . The bet 's off .
JACK: What about your father ? Can he help ?
JANI: Let it go .
JACK: Did they tell you to sleep with me ?
JANI: I told you , all bets are off .
JACK: What for ?
JANI: I have to take the car . She looks at him then leaves the room
JACK'S VOICE: Hang on tightly let go lightly .
GILES: Good night ?
JACK: Not particularly .
GILES: And your lady ?
JACK: She had to leave early . She asked me to thank you .
GILES: A bit unexpected , was n't it ?
JACK: Not entirely .
GILES: How 's that football story corning along ?
JACK: You said it was going to be social , Giles . No business .
JACK'S VOICE: He was overcome with a sense of urgency . He had to get it down Chapter Five .
JACK: It 's beautiful . Thank you .
MARION: I hope it brings you luck .
JACK: It will .
MARION: I do n't care about her . Of course , I was angry . But not with you . The book is yours not mine . I was wrong , what I said about it . I hurt you , did n't I ?
JACK: You 're entitled to your opinion .
MARION: It 's none of my business what you write . And your job , that 's none of my business either . I love you . And I 've done everything wrong . JACK takes her in his arms .
JACK: I 'll leave the casino soon . I promise .
MARION: You will ?
JACK: Within a month . Believe me , I 'm going to quit !
MARION: Then you can dye your hair blond again .
JACK: What ?
MARION: You were talking in your sleep .
JACK: Not talking . Writing .
JANI'S VOICE: I need to see you . I 've moved . I have a new number . It 's 468-3275 . Please call me .
JACK: I want to speak to Jani de Villiers Jani it 's Jack I 'll come over now
JACK'S VOICE: Chapter Seven Jack had decided to see her . The challenge was essential .
JANI: Come in .
JACK: Yes .
JANI: Thank you .
JACK: It does n't seem fair . You 're offering me ten grand in cash but you ca n't afford a decent place .
JANI: Well , life 's not fair . We know that .
JACK: It 's all relative . I need the money too .
JANI: Do you ?
JACK: Yes .
JANI: The date 's not set yet . I 'll call you . One last thing the man you 're going to catch cheating , he may get violent . But you know how to deal with cheats .
JACK: That bruise has cleared up nicely .
JANI: Bruise ? Oh , yes . It 's better .
JACK: I 've still got mine . JACK looks at her hand .
JANI: I took the bandage off yesterday . She crosses to pick up a bottle of Scotch .
JACK: No thank you .
JANI: It 's a shame there are n't more men in the world like you .
JACK'S VOICE: There was a part of Jani he really liked . He turns and leaves the room .
WOMAN: Bring me some luck .
JACK: No more bets .
JACK'S VOICE: Next stage . He had to be secure at 8 to 1 against having to give the money back , so he would n't spend it . If after one month no one had approached him , he calculated the odds of keeping it at 20 to 1 . After three months he figured 100 to 1 no one would turn up .
YOUNG MAN: How about a drink to celebrate ?
MAN: Cash me in .
JACK'S VOICE: Jake 's experiment with the man would prove the point . The MAN hesitates . He ca n't resist .
JANI'S VOICE: It 's set . The day after tomorrow . The twenty-fourth . Good luck .
MARION: Are n't you ever tempted to gamble ?
JACK: Never . Why do you ask ?
MARION: I can just imagine , being around so much money all the time
JACK: Gambling 's not about money .
MARION: Really ?
JACK: Gambling 's about not facing reality . Ignoring the odds . She takes her hands away from his neck .
MARION: I must be a fool . I never think about the odds . The sound of an underground train .
JACK'S VOICE: Chapter Twelve
SUIT: Fifties . Ten of them .
JACK: What colour chips ?
SUIT: Whatever .
JACK: Sir , I ca n't accept that bet .
SUIT: Are you calling me a cheat ?
PUNTER: You are a cheat . I saw you .
SUIT: I 'm talking to you .
REYNOLDS: Ladies and gentlemen , please be calm . There 's no cause for alarm . Enjoy yourselves . It 's Christmas .
NURSE: There you go .
JACK: How did you know I was here ?
MARION: I thought you would n't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here .
JACK: Did you go to the casino ? MARION hands him a glass of wine .
MARION: Happy Christmas . They touch glasses and drink .
JACK: There was a message , was n't there ?
MARION: It 's probably easier for you to eat the rice .
JACK: Marion ! What did you tell the police ?
MARION: Nothing about you .
JACK: Then what ?
MARION: Give up being a croupier , Jack . O I 'll shop you . All you have to do is keep your word . It 's that simple .
JACK: Leave me alone , Marion .
MARION: You 're already alone .
JACK'S VOICE: He had always been alone . He had always believed it would make the decisions easier .
JACK: All right . I do n't want to lose you . I 'll quit . I swear to you . MARION kisses him .
MARION: Why did you take the money ?
JACK: I hate public transport .
MARION: What ?
JACK: I want to buy a car .
MARION: How can anyone be that naive ?
REYNOLDS: How do you feel , Jack ?
JACK: Bruised .
REYNOLDS: Take your time . Two weeks . Three if you need it . We 'll pay you sick leave . I do n't want to lose you . You 're a good man . Here He hands JACK an envelope .
JACK: What 's this ?
REYNOLDS: Happy New Year . Have a drink on the company . You 've earned it .
JACK'S VOICE: Chapter Thirteen

JACK: She was visiting her mother . He mother . Who are you ?
ROSS: Detective Inspector Ross .
JACK: Who
ROSS: Ross .
JACK: Who did it ? Tell me !
ROSS: We think it 's a hit-and-run . A drunk driver , probably , But there is a possibility of a revenge killing .
JACK'S VOICE: Revenge ? For what ? Whose revenge ?
ROSS: As you know , she was a WPC with the Met . up until two years ago .
JACK'S VOICE: What had that got to do with he death ?
ROSS: You did n't recognise the man who attacked you , did you ?
JACK: Of course I recognised him !
ROSS: You did ?
JACK: I know a cheat when I see one . The man was a cheat . ROSS sighs , looks at MARION .
ROSS: If anything occurs to you , call me .
JACK'S VOICE: 'The world breaks everyone , and afterward many are strong at the oken places . But those that will not break , it kills . It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially . If you are none of these , you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry ' .
MATT: Jacko ! How 're you doing ? I heard about the raid . Pity they did n't pull it off . I wish I 'd een there .
JACK: But you were there Matt . MATT does n't hear .
MATT: What ? You know what happened to me , do n't you ? That bitch Bella shopped me . I 'd like to beat the shit out of her .
JACK: I 'd like to buy you a drink .
MATT: Cheers . Happy New Year . I really like you , Jacko , you 're so fucking straight . Hey , you have n't changed you clothes !
JACK'S VOICE: The music stopped , Jack was drunk hallucinating . He was back , as a child , in the Wild Coast Casino .
LUCY: You 've been avoiding me .
JACK: Have I ?
LUCY: I 'm Lucy .
JACK: And what do you do , Lucy ?
LUCY: I 'm a witch . A white witch . Why do n't we move on ?
JACK: Are you going to put a spell on me ?
LUCY: I might .
JACK: Nice car . How much did you pay fo it ?
LUCY: Too much . Eighteen hundred .
JACK: Turn left at the lights . They drive off .
LUCY: Hey ! I saw her !
JACK'S VOICE: Jack did n't trust anyone . Except himself .
PUNTER: You 're wasting yourself . With you luck you ought to come over to ou side .
JACK'S VOICE: Even his publisher had no idea who the author was . He had done the deal through a lawyer . It gave him a good feeling , no one knowing
JACK: Hello
JANI: Jack ! It 's Jani . The following conversation is INTERCUT .
JACK: Jani ! Where are you ?
JANI: Sun City . I 've been meaning to call you for months .
JACK: How are you ?
JANI: Great . I 'm getting married . At least , I think I am .
JACK: Did you solve your problems ?
JANI: Yes . I 'm all over that now . Jack , hold on a minute . There 's someone here who wants to talk to you JACK waits .
JACK: Dad !
JACK SR: I never thanked you properly fo your help . Jani told me you behaved like a perfect gentleman throughout . I knew you would . I know my son .
JACK: As a matter of fact I did . But I won .
JACK'S VOICE: So that was it . The final card . Blackjack . His father , eight thousand miles and twenty seven years away , was still dealing to his son Jack from the bottom of the deck CLOSE-UP A copy of the book ' I CROUPIER ' .
JACK: To you . To both of you .
BELLA: What are you laughing at ? Who was that on the phone ?
JACK: A couple I know are getting married . BELLA puts her arms around him lovingly .
BELLA: Fools . A whistling sound
JACK'S VOICE: Now he had reached the point where he no longer heard the sound of the ball
ERIN: Why are there so many ?
RANDALL: Just hold on to me .
ERIN: It 's because they 're doing this on his birthday .
GONZALEZ: Mr. Randall . Sir . Do you think this execution will bring you a sense of closure ?
RANDALL: Leave us alone !
GONZALEZ: A difficult time for everyone involved . Interesting fact . It will take about twenty-one cents of electricity to execute Alex Corvis tonight on this , his twenty-first irthday .
WALSH: He did n't order that .
MERCER: We found the man with the scar .
WALSH: Get it out of here .
OLD WOMAN: Yes , I 've come to a lot of these over the years , but this one has many unique aspects . Youth of the condemned . That 's unusual . Fifty three stab wounds . Kind of a record .
GONZALEZ'S VOICE: And Corvis still maintaining his innocence .
OLD WOMAN: Oh , they all say that .
TOMMY: I do n't fault him saying I lied on the stand . Facing the chair , you do what you got ta do . But I saw those two fighting that night .
WALSH: You ok ?
ALEX: What 's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace . And I 'll be seeing he again soon . Only what will I say ? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her ? That he 's down here laughing ?
WALSH: Tell her we 'll get him .
ALEX: We wo n't .
WALSH: Someday he 'll surface and I 'll get him for both of you . I promise . I 'll find the guy with the scar .
ERLICH: This mystery man with the scar the zigzag , whatever .
GONZALEZ: Some people here seem to .
DUTTON: People here are protesting the execution of a kid just turning twenty-one . A kid who had a tough life . No parents , no dough . Always had to fight for everything . It 's a tragedy , it really is . But I do n't see a single sign telling me Alex Corvis is innocent . Look around . He 's right .
MERCER: I was facing the hot seat , I 'd want my attorney banging down the door of the Supreme Court , not playing board games . But maybe that 's just me .
WALSH: Your move .
MERCER: No . It 's time .
ALEX: I do n't want you to watch . I do n't want to give them the pleasure . The two friends exchange a long last look .
MERCER: Ok. C'mon now
MINISTER: The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want THE MINISTER CONTINUES as
WARDEN: Alexander Frederick Corvis . Do you have any last words ?
ALEX: I loved Lauren . I still do . I 'm innocent . Erin shakes her head , disgusted . Looks away .
MERCER: Cruel , who 's to say , but it sure was unusual .
GUARD ONE: Look at this . Goddamn helmet melted down .
MERCER: That , my friend , is a deterrent .
GUARD ONE: Why do they even autopsy these guys ? Cause of death is pretty fucking obvious . FROM INSIDE THE LOCKER . The door slams shut .
RANDALL: I 'll meet you atthe car , honey .
DUTTON: We all wish this had ended better . Sir .
ALEX: What happened ?
RADIO GUARD: We 've got unauthorized movement in `` B five . ''
MERCER: Mercer . I 'm on it .
ALEX: It 's my birthday .
MERCER: Yeah , well here 's a present fo you .
ALEX: Go ahead . Make a wish .
MERCER: Taser !

WALSH: Yeah . I sure will .
ALEX: This is where it happened . Right over here .
ERIN: Yeah , I know .
ALEX: Are you ok ?
ERIN: When Lauren was missing the police came to our house . They said they were looking for her , right ? But I know now they had her , and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you

RANDALL: I do . Every day .
CAPTAIN: Erin knows , does n't she ?
ERIN: Dad ? ! You home ?

CAPTAIN: See , I heard you were looking fo some guy with a scar . How 's that going ? You find him ? Yes ? No ? Alex tenses as the Captain starts toward him .
ALEX: You sent them . I had no choice .

ALBRECHT: Damn , I wish he would n't do that .
GRANGE: The son of a bitch winked at me . The he jumped . Three stories .
LAO: Did you see an animal of any kind ? Did you see a bird ?
GRANGE: No . I saw a guitar . This is n't some rock-n-rolle you forgot to pay , is it ? There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird . In lood . Lao 's expression is one of sublime content .
LAO: Good . Grange It could 've been a chicken
SKANK: I wish to hell I had torched Gideon 's , that fat fuck .

GRANGE: I 'd like to get in touch with him . Elly sizes Grange up .
ELLY: You 're not a cop , either . What do you want him for ?
GRANGE: I 'm looking for a good guitar man .
ELLY: Right .
GRANGE: I need to find him kind of soon , Elly .
ERIC: That 's better . He wipes his torso down with a towel .
SKANK: Top , I made the sumbitch ! Face all painted white like some kinda fuckin ' kabuki homo !
LAO: Sounds like our `` Crow '' is out-maneuvering you .
TOP DOLLAR: `` Our '' Crow ?
LAO: Come now . You 've seen the graffiti all over the city in the few hors it has taken you men to drop like plague victims . What about your turf , Top ? You do n't seem to have ripped out anyone 's heart yet .
TOP DOLLAR: The night is young .
SKANK: The found T-bird flash-fried to what was left of his fucking car !
TOP DOLLAR: Hey , you little fuckweed ! That 's against the law ! His gun smoking . Momentary empowerment .
LAO: I am sitting over here .
TOP DOLLAR: Nice speech . What 's it supposed to mean ?
LAO: Your comprehension is not equired . Your cooperation and , indeed , your ability are the issues on the table . Top rallies to this .
TOP DOLLAR: Whatever you say , I can do .
LAO: That 's reassuring .
SKANK: What was that ! ?
TOP DOLLAR: Too many poppers , Skank . Relax . Heel .
SKANK: It 's him , Top ! He dusted T-Bird !
ERIC: You have to be SKank . One moment .
MJ: OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH !
ALBRECHT: Jesus Christ He runs to assist the demolished cruiser .
ERIC: Top Dollar , you 're the only one here still wasting good air
TOP DOLLAR: Five large , in the drawer right over there . I never saw you .
ERIC: Do you know what you destroyed ?
TOP DOLLAR: Take the dope , too .
ERIC: A year ago . A very nice lady circulated a petition . She died . Last Halloween . Answer yes or no .
TOP DOLLAR: That 's ancient history .
ERIC: It 's yesterday ! Do you know what you destroyed ? Top Dollar yells right back at Eric 's anger .
TOP DOLLAR: Who gives a fuck ! I 'm a usinessman . You gon na do me , then do me and shut you 're face !
ERIC: You do n't even remember
TOP DOLLAR: I never forget anything , dickhead . That building was a sweep-and- clear ; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition . It got a little rowdy end of story .
ERIC: Rowdy . Let me fill in some gaps for you .
LEAD SWAT: That 's all she wrote , Bozo ! You stand down now , and that 's an order !
ALBRECHT: Come on !
ERIC: It 's done .
ALBRECHT: I figured as much . Did you cap off Funboy .
ERIC: Funboy had to leave this mortal coil .
ALBRECHT: Yeah , among others . Hey , man you 're hit .
ERIC: It 's only a flesh wound .
ALBRECHT: It 's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds .
ERIC: You should n't smoke these . He pitches the smoke out the open car window .
ALBRECHT: Great . Litterbug of the Living Dead . Eric turns back to Albrecht .
ERIC: I 'm finished . Eric shoots him a doubtful look .
ALBRECHT: Right . You sure I ca n't just take you to the emergency ward ?
ERIC: I have to prepare for an anniversary . This coming night .
GRANGE: What the hell is that ?
LAO: This is a cobra , Mr. Grange . Yes , it is real .
GRANGE: That thing is poisonous .
LAO: Extremely so . You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune , in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow .
GRANGE: Give me a break . That guy 's a wacko
LAO: I intend no slight to you , but I can not find the English to adequately express just what he is . I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury .
GRANGE: Not a Plymouth Fury , I bet . Lao chuckles indulgently .
LAO: Do you know of spirit assassins ? You do know the dead can rise ? Properly motivated , of course .
GRANGE: Like some sort of zombie on a evenge trip .
LAO: Mmm . But tonight I can take what is his .
GRANGE: Only thing you 'll get from that clown is a faster way to die .
LAO: To the contrary
GRANGE: Kill a dead guy ?
LAO: Truly kill him . So I may crush his skull and smoke it . Lao SHRUGS . Grange can handle it .
ELLY: What 's going on ?
ERIC: A remembrance . A closure .
ELLY: I knew . I knew I knew you . Even with the makeup and stuff you wore . You really loved her , did n't you ?
ERIC: You brought flowers . As long as you do n't forget her , Elly , she lives .
ELLY: She 's dead . She 's gone . And now you 're just gon na go away and never come back , too . I hate this place ; it is n't fair .
ERIC: Elly
ELLY: You look funny without your white face on . Like it 's your day off or something . He quizzical expression amuses him .
ERIC: Somebody here wants to meet you . Gabriel ?
ELLY: I remember him ! Here , Gabriel here kitty Gabriel Is he still yours ?
ERIC: I think he 's yours , now .
ELLY: Nobody ever gave me something like that before . Ever . Eric places it around her neck . Elly BEAMS .
ERIC: Shelly would 've wanted you to have it . This way , you 'll think of he every time you see it
ELLY: And she 'll be alive . Up here .
DARLA: I was wonderin ' where you 'd gotten to Oh , Elly , honey , a cat . Here ?
ELLY: He was a present . Besides , we 're moving anyway . You said .
DARLA: We 'll discuss this later . Obviously . You left the door open .
GRANGE: Hi , Elly . Remember me ?
DARLA: I do n't remember you . And I do n't emember inviting
GRANGE: If she opens her face again , shoot her in the head .
ELLY: Mom !
GRANGE: You should listen to your mother . She said no cats . Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window .
ELLY: Gabriel ! Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera .
GRANGE: Now that 's the expression I want .
CREATURE KID: Trick or treat ! Eric smiles . Not tonight .
SKULL COWBOY: Stop screwing around .
ERIC: Tell me I 'll get hurt . That I might die . I 've already done that . I do n't need anyone 's help . Yours included .
SKULL COWBOY: Do this thing and you will be vulnerable . The blood will not eturn . No powers . No reunion . Nothing .
ERIC: Fine with me .
SKULL COWBOY: You 'll be alone .
ERIC: I 'm already alone .
GRANGE: We 've got company .
GRANGE: He 's just out front talking to himself . You tell me .
ERIC: Do n't waste my time .
SKULL COWBOY: Very well , it 's your ass .
ERIC: But why are you still here ?
LAO: Of course you can .
GRANGE: Move in , guys .
LAO: I wish to possess what you have now .
ERIC: I want the girl . Unharmed . Now .
LAO: I know . That is why I will prevail . Mr. Grange ?
ERIC: You 're too late . There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you eally need to talk to . But he turned to dust and blew away . I do n't have any power for you to take .
LAO: I do n't believe that .
ALBRECHT: Had to go get yourself hip-deep in shit , did n't you , my friend .
LAO: I said no shooting !
ALBRECHT: You sorta looked like you might need my help .
ERIC: This is n't your place . This is n't your fight . And I do n't need your help .
ALBRECHT: You 're welcome .
ERIC: Leave here . Do n't do this . I do n't want you here .
ALBRECHT: The hell you say . This is n't just about you any more .
ERIC: Do n't interfere .
ALBRECHT: You 're bleeding , man . You ca n't make it .
ALBRECHT: You wo n't mind if I just take the stairs , then , smartass
ERIC: Here I am .
LAO: Can you fly , Crow man ?
ALBRECHT: I ai n't cut out for this superhero shit .
LAO: Face me !
ALBRECHT: Is he dead yet ?
LAO: No . You are .
ELLY: You go to hell , you pervert !
ERIC: And how many lives have you destroyed ?
LAO: I took yours from you . You little girlfriend ? I took hers , too . Your meaningless , petty life ? I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose . You 're no avenger . You 're mine .
ERIC: You 're right , I 'm not an avenger . Not any more .
LAO: I do n't need eyes to take what I want from you .
ERIC: Can you fly ?
ELLY: Do n't let me fall !
ERIC: In a better place . I hope .
ELLY: You 're not gon na come back , are you ?
ERIC: I do n't know if I can . But you have this and you know where to come .
ELLY: You mean you 'll , like ' dig your way out of the grave ? Euww .
ERIC: For you , I 'll try . Promise .
DARLA: Worktime , kiddo . First day , new job , got ta go .
ELLY: It ca n't rain all the time .
DR. GREENBAUM: Jesus . We 've been at this for six months .
SEBASTIAN: I know .
DR. GREENBAUM: And you have n't made an ounce of progress .
SEBASTIAN: I know . Sebastian takes out a cigarette .
DR. GREENBAUM: There 's no smoking in my office .
SEBASTIAN: What do you want me to say ? That I 'm supposed to feel remorse because I act the way I do ? The truth is I do n't .
DR. GREENBAUM: But you said you have the worst eputation .
SEBASTIAN: I do .
DR. GREENBAUM: Do n't you want to change that ?
SEBASTIAN: Let me tell you something , doctor . Chicks love a guy with a bad rap . They say they do n't , but they do n't mean it . They all think that they 're the ones that are going to `` save me . '' The trick is to let them think it 's true .
DR. GREENBAUM: I think that 's all the time we have for today .
SEBASTIAN: Same time next week ?
DR. GREENBAUM: No . This is going to be our last session .
SEBASTIAN: Why ? I like spending time with you . You know , you 're quite attractive fo a woman your age . You have killer legs . Killer .
DR. GREENBAUM: This is n't a joke . Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here . I 'm trying to help you .
SEBASTIAN: Do n't be insecure , Doc . You 're a big help . Sebastian picks up a book of Freud . SEBASTIAN He was a coke addict , you know .
DR. GREENBAUM: You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me . It does n't work , Sebastian .
SEBASTIAN: It works a little .
DR. GREENBAUM: No it does n't . I see right through you .
SEBASTIAN: You do ?
DR. GREENBAUM: I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase . It 's going to get you into trouble .
SEBASTIAN: Well , you do n't have to get nasty about it .
DR. GREENBAUM: My daughter , Rachel .
SEBASTIAN: Yummy .
DR. GREENBAUM: Do n't even think about it . Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman , who happens to be attending Princeton this fall . She 's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s .
SEBASTIAN: Really ? Care to make a wager on that ?
DR. GREENBAUM: Good luck , Sebastian .
SEBASTIAN: What , nervous I 'm going to win ?
DR. GREENBAUM: Would you please leave . Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves . DR. GREENBAUM Asshole .
RACHEL: Hi , mom .
DR. GREENBAUM: Honey , is something wrong ? Rachel cries for a moment .
RACHEL: He told me he loved me and I believed him .
DR. GREENBAUM: Who told you ?
RACHEL: You do n't know him . I 'm so stupid . She continues to cry .
DR. GREENBAUM: Alright honey , just calm down , take a deep eath , and step out of the circle .
RACHEL: Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit , mom . There 's pictures of me on the internet .
DR. GREENBAUM: What kind of pictures ?
RACHEL: Nudie pictures , what do you think ?
DR. GREENBAUM: Jesus Christ , how can you be so stupid ?
RACHEL: I do n't know . He was just so charming . All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them . Things just got out of hand from there . Mom ? Are you there ? Mom ? Mother ! ! ! !
DR. GREENBAUM: You son of a bitch .
METER MAID: You ca n't park there .
MRS. CALDWELL: I ca n't tell you how happy we are that
KATHRYN: I 'll do my best .
CECILE: What was that ?
KATHRYN: I was thanking her . Vietnamese is such a eautiful language . MRS. CALDWELL Kathryn is a straight A student at Oakwood as well as being President of the French Club . Listen to whateve she has to say and you 'll go far .
KATHRYN: I know this sounds corny , but wheneve I feel temptations of peer pressure ,
MRS. CALDWELL: That 's beautiful .
CECILE: What are the boys like ?
MRS. CALDWELL: Cecile , is that the best you can do ? You must forgive her , Kathryn . She 's neve een in a co-educational atmosphere before .
KATHRYN: Do n't worry , it 's totally understandable . Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman , howeve there are the occasional bad apples .
MRS. CALDWELL: Like your step-brother Sebastian . I ca n't elieve they did n't expel him after what he did to the school nurse .
SEBASTIAN: My , what an adorable shirt you 're wearing .
SEBASTIAN: How are things down under ? Blossoming I hope .
KATHRYN: Cecile 's attending Oakwood in the fall .
SEBASTIAN: Outstanding .
CECILE: What year are you in ?
SEBASTIAN: I 'm what you would call a fifth year senior .
CECILE: But I thought high school is only four years .
SEBASTIAN: It is , unless you 're a fuck up , like myself . He winks at Cecile .
MRS. CALDWELL: I think we 'll be going now . Thanks for all your help . Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile .
KATHRYN: I 'll call you later and we 'll get togethe and plan your curriculum .
CECILE: Thanks . Nice meeting you .
SEBASTIAN: Ciao .
MRS. CALDWELL: Let 's go , Cecile . Now !
SEBASTIAN: Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house ?
KATHRYN: I 'm just taking the poor girl under my wing .
SEBASTIAN: Lovely . How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali ? Zipping through my inheritance per usual ?
KATHRYN: Hopefully , though she suspects that you decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid .
SEBASTIAN: It was fine . He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace . SEBASTIAN I 'm sick of sleeping with these insipid Manhattan Debutantes .
KATHRYN: Oh , poor baby . Well you can relax . I have a mission for you .
SEBASTIAN: What ?
KATHRYN: He did n't dump me . We had a parting of the ways . Sebastian stares her down . KATHRYN Alright he dumped me . He smiles , then swallows the sushi .
SEBASTIAN: You do n't mean ?
KATHRYN: I do n't find this very funny ,
SEBASTIAN: So that 's what this is all about . We 'll get together and plan you curriculum .
KATHRYN: Keep your friends close and you enemies closer . When I get through with her , she 'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court 's heart will be shattered .
SEBASTIAN: Why go through Cecile ? Why not just attack Court ?
KATHRYN: Because if there 's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me . I ca n't allow that to happen . Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way .
SEBASTIAN: I see your point though why should I care ?
KATHRYN: I need you to seduce our young Cecile . Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery .
SEBASTIAN: Sounds intriguing .
KATHRYN: She 's quite cute you know . Young supple breasts , a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie .
SEBASTIAN: I ca n't . Kathryn throws his hand off of hers .
KATHRYN: Why not ?
SEBASTIAN: Oh come on , Kathryn . It 's too easy . `` But I thought high school was only four years . '' I mean , please . She knows nothing . She 's seen nothing . I could have her under the table at Au Ba sucking me off before the appetize arrived . Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it . I have a eputation to uphold .
KATHRYN: Oh but diddling the therapist 's daughter is a challenge ?
SEBASTIAN: That was just simple revenge . What I have planned requires sheer genius .
KATHRYN: I 'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas .
SEBASTIAN: Shut up and turn to page 64 .
KATHRYN: Jesus Christ , is she for real ?
SEBASTIAN: Oh yes . I 've read it over and over again . This baby 's the real deal . Daddy 's little angel . A paradigm of chastity and virtue .
KATHRYN: B.F.D . What do you plan to do ? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy .
SEBASTIAN: It just so happens we 're not in Kansas anymore . Our little angel 's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood . She 's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house . Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation ? Screwing the new headmaster 's virginal daughter before school starts ? It will be my greatest victory .
KATHRYN: You do n't stand a chance . Even this is out of your league .
SEBASTIAN: Care to make a wager on that ?
KATHRYN: I 'll think about it
SEBASTIAN: Oh well , duty calls . Time to add anothe chapter to my work of art . He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL .
KATHRYN: Oh gee , your journal . Could you be more queer ?
SEBASTIAN: Could you be more desperate to read it ?
KATHRYN: Oh Sebastian . About that little wage of yours . He stops . KATHRYN Count me in .
SEBASTIAN: What are the terms ?
KATHRYN: If you lose , then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine .
SEBASTIAN: And if I win ? She approaches him .
KATHRYN: I 'll give you something you 've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married .
SEBASTIAN: Be more specific .
KATHRYN: In English . I 'll fuck your brains out .
SEBASTIAN: What makes you think I 'd go for that et ? That 's a seventy thousand dolla car .
KATHRYN: Because I 'm the only person you ca n't control and it kills you . Sebastian sneers at her . KATHRYN Do we have a deal ?
SEBASTIAN: No way , that car means everything to me .
KATHRYN: You can put it anywhere .
SEBASTIAN: Even there ?
KATHRYN: It would feel so yummy . Sebastian hesitates , then shakes her hand . KATHRYN Happy hunting .
ANNETTE: It 's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond .
AUNT HELEN: Thank you , Annette . Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years . Does your family do much riding ?
ANNETTE: My mother and I used to ride a lot , efore she got sick .
AUNT HELEN: I 'm sorry about that .
ANNETTE: My Grandpa , used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time .
AUNT HELEN: I 'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west . What 's his name ?
ANNETTE: Ben Schwarz .
AUNT HELEN: Schwarz . Jewish ?
ANNETTE: German .
AUNT HELEN: Does n't ring a bell . Annette throws her a concerned look . AUNT HELEN In any event , I want you to conside this your home for the time being .
ANNETTE: Thank you . It 's so peaceful and quiet around here . BANG ! A shotgun sounds in the distance . ANNETTE What was that ?
AUNT HELEN: Sebastian must be here .
SEBASTIAN: Pull ! The TARGET soars into the air , SEBASTIAN Die motherfucker ! He fires the gun , missing the target . SEBASTIAN Shit , shit , shit .
AUNT HELEN: I 've missed you too . How are you parents ?
SEBASTIAN: They 're coming back next week . I write them everyday . She strokes his cheek , lovingly .
AUNT HELEN: Sebastian , this is Annette Harrison . She 's going to be staying with me fo a few weeks .
SEBASTIAN: I guess that makes two of us . Welcome . He extends his hand and they shake . SEBASTIAN Why do n't you head in and whip us up some of that ice tea of yours ? We 'll take care of the horses .
AUNT HELEN: Anything for you , my dear . Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen 's horse . AUNT HELEN Stay out of trouble you two .
SEBASTIAN: So what year are you going into ?
ANNETTE: Junior .
SEBASTIAN: Got a boyfriend back home ?
ANNETTE: No .
SEBASTIAN: Why not ?
ANNETTE: I do n't know . Relationships seem too distracting . I 'd rather concentrate on my studies .
SEBASTIAN: You a lesbo ?
ANNETTE: No . She bends over to pick up the saddle .
SEBASTIAN: Nice . She sighs , disgusted , then turns toward him .
ANNETTE: Are you often this offensive on a first encounter ?
SEBASTIAN: I was just being honest . You happen to have a nice ass . Sorry .
ANNETTE: You did ?
SEBASTIAN: I must say I found it rather appalling .
ANNETTE: That 's a first . Most people praised me for it .
SEBASTIAN: Most people are morons . I mean who are you to knock what you 've never experienced ?
ANNETTE: I was n't knocking anything . It 's just my elief that people should n't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions .
SEBASTIAN: Oh really ?
ANNETTE: Take yourself . You 've slept with several women . Are you happier because of it ?
SEBASTIAN: How do you know I 've been with several women ?
ANNETTE: A friend wrote me .
SEBASTIAN: Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip .
ANNETTE: I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to upset you ut you still did n't answer the question . An uncomfortable silence falls between them ,
SEBASTIAN: Who the hell is taking the time to write letters , spreading this shit about me ?
ANNETTE: It 's not really important .
SEBASTIAN: Fine , forget it . It 's obvious that we 're not going to be friends .
ANNETTE: Why are you being so dramatic ?
SEBASTIAN: Look , I 've got a lot of problems and I 'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me .
ANNETTE: Alright , I said I was sorry . Can we start over again ? I think we 've gotten off on the wrong foot . She approaches him and they shake . ANNETTE Annette Harrison .
SEBASTIAN: Sebastian Valmont . She smiles , but before he releases her hand SEBASTIAN So tell me , Annette . I 'm curious , since you 've never had sex do you touch yourself ?
CECILE: Oh , I suck . I suck .
RONALD: Relax . It 's okay . Take a deep breath . Cecile takes a deep breath RONALD You 're concentrating too much on you owing . Let it flow . He stands and sits behind her . RONALD Here , let me help you . He places his hand over hers . RONALD Now close your eyes and let 's try again .
KATHRYN: I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to interrupt . Your playing was beautiful .
CECILE: Kathryn , this is Ronald Clifford . He 's giving me music lessons over the summer . Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn 's hand .
RONALD: Pleased to meet you .
KATHRYN: Likewise I 'm sure .
CECILE: Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard . He 's composing his first opera .
RONALD: It 's based on the life of Docto Martin Luther King .
CECILE: Doctor King is my favorite .
RONALD: I guess our hour 's up . Same time tomorrow ? Cecile nods .
SEBASTIAN: Unbelievable . Some fag , no offense -
BLAINE: - none taken -
SEBASTIAN: - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me .
BLAINE: Any ideas who it could be ?
SEBASTIAN: Blaine , if I knew who it was that person would n't be alive right now .
BLAINE: Where did you say she 's from ?
SEBASTIAN: Kansas . Who the hell do I know in Kansas ?
BLAINE: Greg McConnell .
SEBASTIAN: The football stud ?
BLAINE: He 's from Kansas City . I would n't be surprised if he was your rat .
SEBASTIAN: It would make sense . McConnell hates me . I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year .
BLAINE: I do n't think that bothered him .
SEBASTIAN: What do you mean ?
BLAINE: Let 's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field .
SEBASTIAN: Are you shitting me ?
BLAINE: I shit you not . McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month . We 'd go at it for a while , then as soon as he 'd cum , he starts freaking out . You know - `` What are you doing , man ? I 'm not a fag . I 'll kick your ass if you say anything . '' It 's like , for Christsakes Greg , you 're gay , deal with it . The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is ecause he 's got a mouth like a Hoover .
SEBASTIAN: Too bad he 's in Kansas this summer .
BLAINE: Not anymore . Football team started practice last week . He 's already called me to hook up .
SEBASTIAN: Really . You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf ?
BLAINE: Hmmm . I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight .
SEBASTIAN: Outstanding .
BLAINE: Do n't think it 's not going to cost you .
SEBASTIAN: No problem . Just make sure your front door is unlocked . Shall we say the `` stroke of midnight '' no pun intended ?
KATHRYN: So , rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds . I hear he 's very nice .
CECILE: He 's alright . He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July .
KATHRYN: Really ? Bulimic headcase .
CECILE: What a loser she must be . Anyhow , Court 's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend .
KATHRYN: That 's great .
CECILE: You think so ? I do n't know . I guess I 'm just scared .
KATHRYN: What are you scared of ?
CECILE: Ah duh . Boys . I 've never even gone to first base with a guy . What do I do ?
KATHRYN: Have n't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends ?
CECILE: Eww . No . That 's gross .
KATHRYN: It 's not gross . How else do you think girls learn ? Here turn around and face me .
CECILE: Are you for real ?
KATHRYN: Do you want to learn or not ?
CECILE: I guess . It still sounds gross .
KATHRYN: See that was n't so bad .
CECILE: It was nothing .
KATHRYN: Let 's try it again , only this time I 'm going to stick my tongue in you mouth . When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours . That 's what first base is .
CECILE: Okay .
KATHRYN: Eyes closed .
CECILE: That was cool .
KATHRYN: Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime .
CECILE: What are you saying ?
KATHRYN: Oh come on Cecile . He 's crazy about you .
CECILE: Is it that obvious ? Kathryn nods . CECILE He sends me letters you know . Love letters .
KATHRYN: That 's so romantic . Have you esponded ?
CECILE: No .
KATHRYN: Well do you like him ?
CECILE: I do n't know .
KATHRYN: Cecile , we just made out in the middle of Central Park . You can trust me .
CECILE: I do like him . I ca n't stop thinking about him . Cecile starts to cry . Kathryn hugs her . CECILE What am I going to do ? If my mothe found out about Ronald she would kill me .
KATHRYN: Listen to me . Your mother must neve know . Never .
CECILE: Okay .
KATHRYN: Did you hide the letters ?
CECILE: Yes . They 're in this antique doll house in my room .
KATHRYN: I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me .
CECILE: Why ?
KATHRYN: Cecile if there 's one thing I 'm great at it 's love letters . With my help , he 'll be eating out of the palm of your hand . Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house .
CECILE: You 'd do that for me ?
KATHRYN: Of course I would . We 're friends , ight ?
CECILE: Best friends .
ANNETTE: Excuse me . Excuse me !
SEBASTIAN: You talking to me ?
ANNETTE: Look , I know this is your house and all , ut do you think you couid keep it down ? I 'm trying to read .
SEBASTIAN: What'cha reading ?
ANNETTE: The Fountainhead .
SEBASTIAN: Great book .
ANNETTE: You 've read The Fountainhead ?
SEBASTIAN: Several times . I 'm not as dumb as I act , you know . When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon most romantic scene in all of literature .
ANNETTE: Romantic ? He rapes her .
SEBASTIAN: That 's a matter of opinion .
ANNETTE: You need help .
SEBASTIAN: Why do n't you come join me for a swim and we 'll discuss it .
ANNETTE: At this hour ? I do n't think so .
SEBASTIAN: Oh come on . Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool .
ANNETTE: Gee , with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse .
SEBASTIAN: Please .
ANNETTE: Give me a minute . I 'll be right down .
SEBASTIAN: Thank you .
KATHRYN: Fuck her yet ?
SEBASTIAN: I 'm working on it .
KATHRYN: Loser .
SEBASTIAN: Blow me .
KATHRYN: Call me later .
SEBASTIAN: Okay .
KATHRYN: Ow . That hurt you stupid bitch .
ANNETTE: You know it amazes me that someone as ight as you can be so horrible .
SEBASTIAN: What ? Another letter from your friend ?
ANNETTE: This is my favorite part . Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating . He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention . Every young girl he has successfully pursued has egretted it .
SEBASTIAN: You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who 's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face . How do you know it 's not some girl who 's pissed off at me for breaking up with her ?
ANNETTE: I sincerely doubt it .
SEBASTIAN: Give me the fucking letter . Annette smiles and tears the letter up . SEBASTIAN Why did you do that ?
ANNETTE: The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I 'm away .
SEBASTIAN: Is that the last thing you need ? My your clever .
ANNETTE: How 's the water ?
SEBASTIAN: Refreshing . She dives in the pool and surfaces . SEBASTIAN You 're right you know .
ANNETTE: About what ?
SEBASTIAN: About what you said today in the stable . I 'm not a happy person .
ANNETTE: I never said that .
SEBASTIAN: You implied it .
ANNETTE: Look , I did n't mean to give you a hard time .
SEBASTIAN: No , it 's okay . I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well , YOU seem to be happy in you choices . I envy you . No bullshit .
ANNETTE: Thank you .
SEBASTIAN: Seriously , you 're amazing . You have everything going for you . You 're smart , you 're beautiful , you 're determined . You 're everything I want in a girlfriend .
ANNETTE: Shut up .
SEBASTIAN: I was n't kidding . I 'd like to take you out .
ANNETTE: Look , I 'm flattered but , seriously it could never work .
SEBASTIAN: Why not ?
ANNETTE: Because you act like a pig . He swims towards her .
SEBASTIAN: Do you deny that there 's an attraction etween us ?
ANNETTE: I do n't I do n't want to answer that look we 're friends .
SEBASTIAN: You do n't find me cute ? Come on , look at these muscles . He flexes for her . She laughs .
ANNETTE: I 'm sorry , but you 're not my type .
SEBASTIAN: Fine . Friends it is . I can live with that .
ANNETTE: You 're naked .
SEBASTIAN: It 's my house . She pushes him off her .
ANNETTE: That 's repulsive .
SEBASTIAN: What 's the big deal ? We 're friends . Have n't you ever seen your friends naked before ? Annette climbs out of the pool .
ANNETTE: Get some manners . She walks into the house .
SEBASTIAN: Sorry , I did n't know you were peenaphobic .
GREG: Oh God Oh God , I 'm gon na cum . I 'm gon na cum I 'm gon na The door swings open and Sebastian enters .
SEBASTIAN: Hey Blaine , did I leave my holy shit .
GREG: Jesus !
SEBASTIAN: Greg , is that you under the covers ?
GREG: Get out of here .
SEBASTIAN: Whoa !
GREG: I told you to lock the door .
BLAINE: I thought I did .
GREG: Look Valmont . This was the first time I 've ever done something like this . I was
SEBASTIAN: really drunk and blah blah blah lah blah .
GREG: Please do n't tell anyone . This could uin my career .
SEBASTIAN: Your career ? What about your family ? Can you imagine the humiliation you father 's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer .
BLAINE: Hey hey hey . Careful Valmont , he 's not a fudge packer . Cum chugger yes ut not a fudge packer .
GREG: Please . I 'm begging you . I 'll do anything . Let 's just forget the whole thing .
SEBASTIAN: Hmmmmmmm nah . I ca n't help you there . It 's too good to pass up . Greg starts to cry . SEBASTIAN After all , it is you who 's bad- mouthing me to Annette Harrison .
GREG: Annette Harrison ? I do n't know what you 're talking about .
SEBASTIAN: Come on Greg . You 're the only one who knows her . The truth will save you .
GREG: I swear on my life , I never said a word to her about you .
BLAINE: I think he 's telling the truth Valmont . Greg could n't write a grocery list let alone a letter .
SEBASTIAN: Alright , I believe you . Stop crying . Your secret 's safe with me . Greg wipes his eyes . SEBASTIAN However , this whole incident 's kind of turned me on . Sebastian unzips his fly . SEBASTIAN You get my point .
BLAINE: Our boy just ca n't get enough dick .
GREG: You sick son of a bitch . Blaine and Sebastian laugh .
SEBASTIAN: I 'll leave you guys alone . Score one for the team , Greg . Sebastian leaves the room , then re-enters . SEBASTIAN Come to think of it , there is something you can do for me .
ANNETTE: No thank you .
SEBASTIAN: How are you today ?
ANNETTE: Give it up .
SEBASTIAN: Oh right , last night . I guess I owe you an apology .
ANNETTE: I 'm not going to speak to you till you ealize that you ca n't intimidate me .
SEBASTIAN: I said I was sorry .
ANNETTE: It was fine .
SEBASTIAN: I wish I could say the same fo myself . I was up thinking about you all night .
ANNETTE: I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends .
SEBASTIAN: Yes , well unfortunately I ca n't just switch the `` on '' button to `` off . '' The sad fact of the matter is that you 've unintentionally rubbed off on me . Annette stops running and turns to him .
ANNETTE: And that 's a bad thing ?
SEBASTIAN: I 'm trying to better myself , but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away .
ANNETTE: I 'm sorry , but I 'm not here to be you savior .
SEBASTIAN: Well try this one on for size . I think I 'm falling in love with you .
ANNETTE: You do n't even know me .
SEBASTIAN: Do n't you believe in love at first sight ?
ANNETTE: Yes , but only when it 's mutual . And this is far from mutual .
SEBASTIAN: Ouch . Do you think we could spend some time together this morning ?
ANNETTE: I ca n't . I 'm seeing a friend .
SEBASTIAN: Who ?
ANNETTE: That 's none of your business .
SEBASTIAN: How about tonight ?
ANNETTE: I 'm busy .
SEBASTIAN: Doing what ?
ANNETTE: That 's also none of your business .
SEBASTIAN: Tell me what to do , Annette . How can I win your heart . I 'll do anything . I ca n't get you out of my mind .
ANNETTE: You truly want to do something to make me happy ?
SEBASTIAN: Yes .
ANNETTE: And you promise to abide by it ?
SEBASTIAN: Without question .
ANNETTE: Alright . I want you to leave and go back to New York .
SEBASTIAN: What ?
ANNETTE: If that 's a problem , then I 'll make arrangements to stay with some friends . Sebastian thinks for a moment . He 's pissed .
SEBASTIAN: I 'll leave this afternoon . Happy ?
ANNETTE: It 's not about being happy . You and I ca n't -
GREG: He told you he 's failing in love with you ? I 've never known him to say those words before .
ANNETTE: Really ? I thought he said it all the time .
GREG: That 's not his style . one thing I can say about Valmont . He always speaks the truth . Annette looks lost . GREG What 's wrong ?
ANNETTE: Nothing .
GREG: Is there a mutual feeling between you two ?
ANNETTE: No . I mean . I do n't know . What else do you know about him ?
GREG: Not a whole lot . We take some classes together . He 's got a bad rep , but it 's mostly bullshit .
ANNETTE: What do you mean ?
GREG: Well , a lot of people are jealous cause he 's loaded .
ANNETTE: I do n't know . I 've been hearing some awful things about him .
GREG: From who ?
ANNETTE: I ca n't tell you . I 'm sworn to secrecy . Greg takes her hand .
GREG: Annette , how long have we known each other ?
ANNETTE: Forever .
GREG: Now it 's my job to look out for you . You 're like a kid sister to me . Do I look like some kind of gossip queen ? Annette laughs .
ANNETTE: You promise not to say anything ?
GREG: On my mother 's life .
ANNETTE: Okay
SEBASTIAN: That nosey bitch . Are you sure ?
GREG: Positive .
SEBASTIAN: Did you do everything I asked you to ?
GREG: Yes .
SEBASTIAN: You told her I never said I love you efore ?
GREG: Yes !
SEBASTIAN: You told her that people are jealous cause I 'm loaded ?
GREG: Yes !
SEBASTIAN: And you think she bought it ?
GREG: I 'm pretty sure she did .
SEBASTIAN: Pretty sure or sure sure ?
GREG: She bought it .
SEBASTIAN: I 'll be in touch . Click . The line goes dead .
KATHRYN: Enough with the music . Fuck he already .
SEBASTIAN: You would not believe what
KATHRYN: Shhh .
SEBASTIAN: You ready for this ? I 've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me .
KATHRYN: Interesting .
SEBASTIAN: I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag . Any luck corrupting her daughter ?
KATHRYN: No .
SEBASTIAN: Call Cecile up and get her to come over . I 'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat .
KATHRYN: The plot thickens . It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher .
SEBASTIAN: Ooo , I 'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that .
KATHRYN: Not to mention Court Reynolds . Unfortunately , Ronald 's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder .
SEBASTIAN: What 's your plan of attack ?
KATHRYN: I rat Cecile out to mommy . Mommy goes allistic and ends their relationship . Boo hoo .
SEBASTIAN: But who will they turn to for help ? Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian 's lap .
KATHRYN: Cecile is planning to go away with Court next week . I 'll need you to speed up her sexual awakenings . Sebastian rubs her shoulders .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm at your service .
KATHRYN: Thank you . Mmmm , that feels good .
SEBASTIAN: Oh sis . You 're so tense .
KATHRYN: I hate when things do n't go my way . It makes me so horny .
SEBASTIAN: I hate it too .
KATHRYN: I know .
SEBASTIAN: Moving along quite well .
KATHRYN: Have you succeeded in your task ?
SEBASTIAN: Any day now .
KATHRYN: Well , let me know when you do . Until then . She takes his hand out from under her pants . KATHRYN No pootie . Kathryn smiles . KATHRYN Sorry .
SEBASTIAN: Goodbye Mister Bond . He picks up the phone and dials . SEBASTIAN Hi , it 's Sebastian . I did n't wake you did I ?
ANNETTE: No , not at all .
SEBASTIAN: Well , I was just calling to see how you 're doing .
ANNETTE: I 'm I 'm alright .
SEBASTIAN: How was your date ?
ANNETTE: It was n't a date . He 's just a friend . There 's a moment of uncomfortable silence .
SEBASTIAN: Well , I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you . I 'll let you go .
ANNETTE: Wait , do n't hang up .
SEBASTIAN: Okay ?
ANNETTE: What are you doing ?
SEBASTIAN: Reading .
ANNETTE: What are you reading ?
SEBASTIAN: Of Human Bondage .
ANNETTE: Somerset Maugham .
SEBASTIAN: Yeah , it 's pretty relevant considering my situation .
ANNETTE: You 're not gon na start that again .
SEBASTIAN: No . I 'm through with my childish games when it comes to you . Hold on , that 's my other line . Rub .
ANNETTE: Sure . Have a good night .
SEBASTIAN: I will .
GRETCHEN: Of Human Bondage . You 're such a ullshit artist .
SEBASTIAN: Shut up , Gretchen . You do n't even know what it is .
GRETCHEN: Duh , it 's a book .
SEBASTIAN: Do you know what it 's about ?
MORA: Who cares . Books are for fags .
SEBASTIAN: Books are for fags . I weep for the future .
SALESWOMAN: Here 's something you might like . Kathryn examines the label .
KATHRYN: Do you carry any real fur ?
SALESWOMAN: No . All our fur is faux .
KATHRYN: Of course . The animals . How silly of me .
MRS. CALDWELL: I got your message and came as quick as I could .
KATHRYN: I hope I did n't keep you from something .
MRS. CALDWELL: Not at all . What 's wrong ?
KATHRYN: It 's Cecile .
MRS. CALDWELL: What about her ?
KATHRYN: Well you promise you wo n't say anything to her . We 've developed a friendship and
MRS. CALDWELL: Kathryn , you have my word . It is n't drugs is it ?
KATHRYN: It 's worse . I think there 's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher .
MRS. CALDWELL: Ronald ? That 's crazy .
KATHRYN: I know . She 's so young and he 's so -
MRS. CALDWELL: Black . Kathryn reacts to her remark .
KATHRYN: He 's been sending her love letters that she hides under her doll house . I questioned whether or not to tell you , ut something like this could destroy her reputation at Oakwood and I do n't want to see her get hurt .
MRS. CALDWELL: I ca n't thank you enough .
KATHRYN: You will be discreet about this ?
MRS. CALDWELL: Absolutely .
SALESWOMAN: Will that be cash or charge ? Kathryn looks through her purse .
KATHRYN: Oh poo . I left my credit cards at home . Mrs. Caldwell takes out her purse .
MRS. CALDWELL: Let me get that for you .
KATHRYN: Oh please . I ca n't have you do that .
MRS. CALDWELL: It 's the least I can do .
KATHRYN: Thank you .
MRS. CALDWELL: Who the hell do you think you are ? !
RONALD: Excuse me .
MRS. CALDWELL: I 'm paying you to give cello lessons . Not to pervert my child .
RONALD: Mrs. Caldwell I think you 're misunderstanding something .
MRS. CALDWELL: Is that so ? Mrs. Caldwell holds up Ronald 's letters . MRS. CALDWELL You care to explain this then ? Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry .
CECILE: Where did you find those ?
MRS. CALDWELL: Margarita found them while cleaning your room .
CECILE: Those are my letters !
MRS. CALDWELL: Do n't you raise your voice at me . Go to your room , now . Cecile turns to Ronald . MRS. CALDWELL Now !
RONALD: Got me off the streets ? I live on 59th and Park .
MRS. CALDWELL: Whatever . You are never to set foot in this house again and you are neve and I mean never to see my daughte again . Is that understood ? !
RONALD: First of all , maam , I never touched your daughter and second , I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond acial lines .
MRS. CALDWELL: Oh do n't give me any of that racist crap . My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell .
RONALD: I guess that puts me in my place . Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell . It was a true awakening . He storms off .
SEBASTIAN: You 're a lucky guy .
RONALD: She really loves me . Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes . RONALD What do I do ?
KATHRYN: What do you do ? Tell her you love her .
RONALD: But I ca n't even see her . She does n't have her own phone , I do n't even know her e-mail address .
SEBASTIAN: Ronald , e-mail 's for geeks and pedophiles . Be romantic . Write he another letter .
RONALD: How will I get to her ?
KATHRYN: Because we want to see Cecile happy and we know you make her happy . She hands Ronald a pen and paper . KATHRYN Now you just march yourself into the study and start writing . We 'll be there to check on you in a minute .
SEBASTIAN: Who are you calling ?
KATHRYN: Cecile . Sebastian hangs up the phone . KATHRYN What are you doing ?
SEBASTIAN: Before we go through with this , I just want you to be aware of the damage we 're going to cause .
KATHRYN: I 'm aware .
SEBASTIAN: Are you really ? I mean , we 've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this I mean , we 're destroying an innocent girl . You do realize that .
KATHRYN: What is that ? Oh my God , it 's you conscience .
SEBASTIAN: You amaze me .
KATHRYN: Eat me , Sebastian . It 's alright for you to fuck everyone , but because I 'm a girl it 's wrong . Well let me tell you something , I did n't ask to be a girl . Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven , so I can be considered a `` laaaady . '' Do you think I take great delight when I hear - `` Kathryn is so wonderful . '' `` Kathryn is a model child . '' `` Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day . '' I 'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it . No , I do n't enjoy eing a part of the weaker sex and fo that reason everyone around me is going to suffer . So there 's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud . Now are you in or are you out ?
SEBASTIAN: Cecile . Now I need you to listen to me very carefully . I have a letter from Ronald that he asked me to give to you . Now I ca n't exactly bring it to your house , since your mothe despises me so here 's what we 're going to do .
CECILE: Finished .
SEBASTIAN: Excellent .
CECILE: You think he 'll like it ?
SEBASTIAN: He 'll love it .
CECILE: What are you doing ?
SEBASTIAN: Just taking your photo .
CECILE: I look terrible .
SEBASTIAN: Mmmm , you 're right . Those clothes do n't do you justice . Why do n't you take them off . Cecile gasps .
CECILE: I 'm getting out of here .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm sorry that was out of line .
CECILE: I want to go home .
SEBASTIAN: I was just kidding .
CECILE: I want to go home . He moves toward the phone
SEBASTIAN: Okay , okay . I 'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up .
CECILE: My mom ? Do n't call my mom .
SEBASTIAN: Why not ? Oh wow , she does n't know you 're here . In fact , you 're grounded . Jesus , you could get in a shitload of trouble for this . I think I should call her anyway .
CECILE: Please please please . I 'll do anything . Just do n't call my mom .
SEBASTIAN: Cecile , all I want to do is give you a kiss .
CECILE: And then I can go home ?
SEBASTIAN: Of course . I 'm not a monster .
CECILE: Just a kiss , right ?
SEBASTIAN: I swear .
CECILE: What are you doing ?
SEBASTIAN: You promised to let me kiss you .
CECILE: But -
SEBASTIAN: I do n't want to kiss you here . I want to kiss you there .
MRS. CALDWELL: Cecile are you up yet ? We 're gon na to e late for the - She notices the bed is empty . MRS. CALDWELL Cecile ? She walks over the bathroom door and knocks . MRS. CALDWELL Cecile ?
AUNT HELEN: More the merrier . Is everything alright my dear ?
CECILE: I 'm just not feeling well . Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket .
SEBASTIAN: Afternoon ladies .
MRS. CALDWELL: I did n't know you 'd be here , Sebastian .
SEBASTIAN: I was n't planning on it , but being such a lovely day , why waste it in the city . Anyone for tennis ?
AUNT HELEN: I better go check on them . Aunt Helen stands and enters the house .
SEBASTIAN: Alone again . What are you up to today ?
ANNETTE: I 'm doing some volunteer work .
SEBASTIAN: Need any company ?
ANNETTE: You ? Volunteer ? I do n't think so .
SEBASTIAN: I do n't know ? Maybe I 'd like it . I 'm trying to change here . You could be supportive .
ANNETTE: Okay .
SEBASTIAN: Babe , you 're looking at the next Mothe Teresa . Annette shakes her head and laughs .
CECILE: Please . I need you . I do n't know what to do . You 're the only one I can talk to .
KATHRYN: I 'll be there in a few hours . She hangs up the phone and smiles .
NURSE: It 's really nice when the young people help out . Most of our patients do n't have any family nearby .
MRS. SUGERMAN: Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
SEBASTIAN: Yes , you already did .
MRS. SUGERMAN: I did ? Sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper .
SEBASTIAN: Right after we played backgammon .
MRS. SUGERMAN: We played backgammon ?
SEBASTIAN: Uh huh . You beat me three times .
MRS. SUGERMAN: I did ?
SEBASTIAN: Yep . Then I fucked your daughter .
MRS. SUGERMAN: Excuse me ?
SEBASTIAN: I said , do you want some water ?
MRS. SUGERMAN: Oh no thank you There 's a knock at the door .
SEBASTIAN: Come in . Annette and the nurse enter .
NURSE: How we doing in here ?
MRS. SUGERMAN: I won three games of backgammon . Sebastian smiles at Annette , who smiles back .
SEBASTIAN: It 's weird . I actually feel good about myself . Can we do this again next week ?
ANNETTE: Oh please .
SEBASTIAN: What ?
ANNETTE: `` I actually feel good about myself ? ''
SEBASTIAN: I do .
ANNETTE: You must take me for a real idiot .
SEBASTIAN: I do n't .
ANNETTE: You 're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady .
SEBASTIAN: I did . We played three games of backgammon and She throws him a look . SEBASTIAN Alright . I was bored out of my fucking mind . I hate doing charity .
ANNETTE: That 's okay . It does n't make you a bad person .
SEBASTIAN: Yes it does .
ANNETTE: No , it does n't . I 'm happy you 're being honest with me .
SEBASTIAN: I ca n't win with you .
ANNETTE: It 's not about winning . You know what your problem is ? You take yourself way too seriously .
SEBASTIAN: I do not .
ANNETTE: Lighten up .
SEBASTIAN: I am lighten . Can we drop this ?
ANNETTE: Fine .
SEBASTIAN: What are you doing ? Stop it , it 's distracting .
ANNETTE: Oh dear , are you actually laughing ?
SEBASTIAN: No .
ANNETTE: No ? She makes the face again . He laughs .
SEBASTIAN: Stop that . She laughs with him .
ANNETTE: There 's hope for you , yet .
CECILE: Who is it ?
KATHRYN: Calm down . Tell me what 's wrong .
CECILE: Something awful happened last night .
KATHRYN: What do you mean ? !
CECILE: I I do n't think you want to know .
KATHRYN: Cecile , you have to tell me .
CECILE: It involves your brother . He took advantage of me .
KATHRYN: Does your mother know ?
CECILE: If she knew , she 'd kill me . It happened at your house last night .
KATHRYN: Why did n't you do something ?
CECILE: I do n't know .
KATHRYN: So , let me get this straight . You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you .
CECILE: Well not exactly .
KATHRYN: He made you give him a blow job .
CECILE: No .
KATHRYN: Well what then ?
CECILE: If that 's what you call it .
KATHRYN: Cecile , I think you 're going to have a hard time crying rape if that 's all he did .
CECILE: What do I do then ?
KATHRYN: Well did you like it ?
CECILE: Well I do n't know - it was weird . At first it felt icky , then it felt kind of okay . Then , I started getting eally hot and then I started shaking and then like , I do n't t know it felt like an explosion , but a good one . Kathryn laughs .
KATHRYN: Cecile , you had an orgasm .
CECILE: I did ?
KATHRYN: I 'm so proud of you . You 're becoming a woman .
CECILE: I am ? Kathryn nods . Cecile embraces her , happy .
KATHRYN: Now listen . Now that you 're on you way , it would be stupid of you to stop . Think of Sebastian as a tutor . Let him instruct you .
CECILE: I do n't love him . I love Ronald .
KATHRYN: So ? Do n't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy ? Practice makes perfect , Cecile . My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible .
CECILE: But that would make me a slut . Would n't it ?
KATHRYN: Cecile , everybody does it . It 's just that nobody talks about it . Cecile takes the information in .
CECILE: It 's like a secret society .
KATHRYN: That 's one way of looking at it .
CECILE: Cool .
KATHRYN: I just had a nice chat with Cecile . I do n't think she 'll be giving you anymore problems .
SEBASTIAN: Yippy .
KATHRYN: Who are you spying on ?
SEBASTIAN: Take a look for yourself .
KATHRYN: That her ?
SEBASTIAN: Yeah .
KATHRYN: Jesus , she reeks of Laura Ashley . Oh , she 's crying . Wittle baby 's upset y the big bad book . Sebastian grabs the binoculars from her .
SEBASTIAN: Shut up .
KATHRYN: What 's your problem ?
SEBASTIAN: Nothing .
KATHRYN: She 's really getting to you , is n't she ?
SEBASTIAN: If you must know , yes . I do n't know what to do . I ca n't stand that holie than thou bullshit and yet , I 'm completely infatuated with her . She made me laugh .
KATHRYN: And that 's why you 're losing your bet ?
SEBASTIAN: I 'm not losing the bet . It 's just taking longer than I expected .
KATHRYN: Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride ?
SEBASTIAN: Kathryn , the only thing you 're going to e riding is me . Now if you 'll excuse me , I have some work to do . He storms out of the room .
ANNETTE: Not at all . Have a seat . He sits down next to her .
SEBASTIAN: Do n't tell me you finished The Fountainhead already ? She nods . He points to her book . SEBASTIAN Great book . What 's the guy 's name , Florentino
ANNETTE: Florentino Ariza .
SEBASTIAN: My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino .
ANNETTE: Who 's Monsieur Philipe ?
SEBASTIAN: You do n't know Monsieur Philipe ? Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET . SEBASTIAN Bonjour mademoiselle .
ANNETTE: Bonjour Monsieur Philipe .
SEBASTIAN: You are very pretty . I would like to kiss you . The puppet kisses her on the cheek . SEBASTIAN Oooo , that felt good .
ANNETTE: Thank you . He kisses her on the cheek .
SEBASTIAN: That felt good too . I will kiss you all over .
ANNETTE: I am too .
SEBASTIAN: You know what ? I do n't take it back .
ANNETTE: Why are you doing this ?
SEBASTIAN: Because I 'm in love with you .
ANNETTE: I thought you said we were going to be friends .
SEBASTIAN: I ca n't handle it . I ca n't keep my feelings bottled up like you . Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me ? Tell me !
ANNETTE: I have feelings for you .
SEBASTIAN: Then what 's wrong ? I love you Annette . It 's not like you have a husband , unless your married to Jesus .
ANNETTE: That 's not fair .
SEBASTIAN: Why ca n't we be together ? Annette 's eyes well up with tears .
ANNETTE: You really want to know ?
SEBASTIAN: Yes .
ANNETTE: It 's because I do n't trust myself with you . I took a vow and because of you I 'm tempted to break it . Do n't destroy that for me . Please . She hurries off .
SEBASTIAN: Shit .
CECILE: Want to join me ?
SEBASTIAN: Some other time , Cecile .
CECILE: Am I suppose to be this sore ?
SEBASTIAN: For the first time , yes . It 'll pass . A moment of silence .
CECILE: I like it better when I 'm on top .
SEBASTIAN: Cecile . This is what I like to call quiet time . This is time when we eflect on what we 've done .
CECILE: I 'm sorry .
SEBASTIAN: You think ?
CECILE: Is it me ?
SEBASTIAN: No , you were fine .
CECILE: It 's that girl , Annette .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm getting out of here . Sebastian heads to the bathroom .
CECILE: Where are you going ?
ANNETTE: Come in . Sebastian enters the room .
SEBASTIAN: I just came to say goodbye .
ANNETTE: Where are you going ?
SEBASTIAN: Back to the city . I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer . I just ca n't handle it around here .
ANNETTE: I think that 's for the best .
SEBASTIAN: Good for you .
ANNETTE: Sebastian , please . I do n't want us to end on bad terms .
SEBASTIAN: Well , I 'm afraid you do n't have a choice in the matter . You make me sick . You 're a hypocrite and I do n't associate with hypocrites . Annette 's eyes well up with tears .
ANNETTE: How am I a hypocrite ?
SEBASTIAN: Oh please Annette . You spend all you time preaching about waiting for love . Well here it is . Right in front of you , ut you 're going to turn your back on it . I 'm sorry that we 're not at the age where we can get married . If we were , I 'd propose , but that 's not going to happen . So I guess we 're just fucked . I 'll move on , but you you 're going to have to live with yourself knowing you 've turned your back on love . And that makes you a hypocrite . Sebastian heads to the door . SEBASTIAN Have a nice life .
ANNETTE: Please do n't go .
SEBASTIAN: Get off me . She kisses him passionately .
ANNETTE: I I want you .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm sorry , I ca n't .
KATHRYN: Morning !
SEBASTIAN: Morning .
KATHRYN: So ? How 'd it go last night ?
SEBASTIAN: With who ?
KATHRYN: Well I know how it went with Cecile . She wo n't shut up about it . How 'd it go with Mrs. Jesus ? Sebastian sits up in bed .
SEBASTIAN: If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no .
KATHRYN: She shot you down .
SEBASTIAN: Exactly the opposite .
KATHRYN: So what went wrong ?
SEBASTIAN: I do n't know . She was lying on the bed , eady to do it , but I I do n't , I was I just did n't feel right about it .
KATHRYN: You 're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you did n't . God are you a chump .
SEBASTIAN: A momentary lapse of judgment , soon to e rectified .
KATHRYN: If you 're heading towards her room , you wo n't find her .
SEBASTIAN: Where is she ?
KATHRYN: You do n't know ? She left thirty minutes ago .
SEBASTIAN: Where 'd she go ?
KATHRYN: She would n't say . She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends . You blew it , Sebastian . That girl has come to her senses and she will neve go near you again .
SEBASTIAN: We 'll see about that .
GREG: Hello .
SEBASTIAN: Is she with you ?
GREG: Who is this ?
SEBASTIAN: Sebastian , you faggot . Is she with you ?
GREG: No .
SEBASTIAN: Where is she ? !
GREG: I do n't know . Why do n't you leave he alone .
SEBASTIAN: McConnell , I 'm gon na out your ass in two seconds if you do n't tell me where she is .
GREG: I told you I do n't know .
SEBASTIAN: One .
GREG: Alright . She 's staying with some friends of her parents . The O'Sheas . She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central .
SEBASTIAN: Grand Central . You better not be fucking with me cause it 's your ass on the line . Sebastian clicks off his cell phone . SEBASTIAN Motherfucker . He bangs on his dashboard .
ANNETTE: Hi .
SEBASTIAN: Hi . She walks over to him and kisses him . SEBASTIAN You alright ?
ANNETTE: I 'm fine . I have to get going to my friends ' house . Was it
SEBASTIAN: It was perfect .
KATHRYN: Kind of .
SEBASTIAN: Well , you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you would n't have invited me in . Sebastian walks toward the closet . SEBASTIAN Who is our little friend so inexperienced that you have to resort to the alphabet game ?
RONALD: It 's not what it seems like . Ronald picks up his clothes . As he leaves
SEBASTIAN: Say hi to Cecile .
KATHRYN: Call me . Sebastian throws Kathryn a look . KATHRYN You ca n't have all the fun . Sebastian sits on the bed . KATHRYN You seem to be in a good mood .
SEBASTIAN: I am . A big grin appears on Sebastian 's face
KATHRYN: You did n't ?
SEBASTIAN: Oh yes .
KATHRYN: Tell me all the details .
SEBASTIAN: It was Fantastic .
KATHRYN: Oh come on . For her first time ?
SEBASTIAN: I know . That 's the amazing part of it . I mean , it was n't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics , just standard missionary stuff , but it was ah forget it . I 'm going to sound like a Hallmark card .
KATHRYN: No , tell me .
SEBASTIAN: It was it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part .
KATHRYN: Wow . So you made love . Ooo , I hea the birds chirping .
SEBASTIAN: Mock , mock , mock . She places her hand on his crotch .
KATHRYN: So I assume you 've come here to make some arrangements . Sebastian stands .
SEBASTIAN: Some other time .
KATHRYN: Excuse me ?
SEBASTIAN: I 'm not in the mood .
KATHRYN: And that 's why you 're leaving ?
SEBASTIAN: It clearly is why .
KATHRYN: I want to fuck .
SEBASTIAN: And I do n't . He leaves and slams the door behind him .
KATHRYN: Oh my God . You 're completely p-whipped .
SEBASTIAN: No , I 'm not .
KATHRYN: P-whipped , p-whipped .
SEBASTIAN: What 's wrong with you ? Why are you acting this way ? Kathryn starts to cry .
KATHRYN: I 'm sorry . It 's just upsetting . You 're in love with her . You do n't love me anymore .
SEBASTIAN: Oh come on , Kathryn , it was just a contest .
KATHRYN: At first it was , but now it 's become something bigger .
SEBASTIAN: Kathryn , you know I love you . I 've always loved you .
KATHRYN: Not anymore you do n't . It 's obvious .
SEBASTIAN: I ca n't believe you 're reacting this way . You 're just saying this because you lost the bet .
KATHRYN: Is that what you think ?
SEBASTIAN: That 's not fair . You 're taking all the fun out of it .
KATHRYN: Then do me a favor and get rid of her . If not for me , then do it for you . Look at yourself . You 're a joke . She 's turned you into jelly . What do you want to be , one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling . People used to respect you . They feared you and now you 're going to throw that all away . Sebastian stares at her , lost in thought . KATHRYN Poor Sebastian . He used to be cool , but now he 's just another love-struck faggot . One of the many .
SEBASTIAN: I 've never done this before .
KATHRYN: How have you dumped girls in the past ?
SEBASTIAN: Screening calls . Any suggestions ?
KATHRYN: I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons . He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other . But she had this huge weight problem . His friends taunted him mercilessly about it . You know , `` How do you breathe when she sits on you face ? '' `` It 's embarrassing for you to e seen with her . '' Finally he could n't take it anymore and decided to dump her . She flipped and he went on the defensive . I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and ove again . `` I 'm completely fucked up . '' `` I 'm completely fucked up . '' `` I 'm completely fucked up . '' Poor fatty never had a chance .
SEBASTIAN: Hi . Is Annette at home ?
MRS. O'SHEA: You must be Sebastian . I 've heard such nice things about you . He smiles . MRS. O'SHEA Annette . Come on in .
ANNETTE: Hi .
SEBASTIAN: Hi .
MRS. O'SHEA: Well , I 'm going to head back to the kitchen . You two have fun .
ANNETTE: Would you like a tour ?
SEBASTIAN: Sure .
ANNETTE: And this is my room .
SEBASTIAN: This is n't working out for me anymore .
ANNETTE: Yeah , me neither .
SEBASTIAN: It 's not you , it 's me . I 'm completely fucked up .
ANNETTE: What are you saying ?
SEBASTIAN: Why are n't you understanding ?
ANNETTE: I love you .
SEBASTIAN: I know . I wish I felt the same . Unfortunately , I feel nothing . I think it was just the conquest . Sorry , I 'm completely fucked up . Annette bursts into tears .
ANNETTE: Why are you trying to hurt me ?
SEBASTIAN: I 'm just being honest . I just wanted to see what you were like in bed .
ANNETTE: You do n't know how to love .
SEBASTIAN: You do n't even know me . The fact of the matter is there is some one I love . She 's smarter , prettier you do n't even compare to her . The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive .
ANNETTE: But you knew this was important to me .
SEBASTIAN: What , your virginity ? Well that 's ove now .
ANNETTE: Please go . He opens the door .
SEBASTIAN: Sorry . I 'm completely fucked up .
KATHRYN: Jesus .
SEBASTIAN: I have a flair for drama .
KATHRYN: Mind if I ask what you 're doing in my oom ?
SEBASTIAN: You wanted an answer to your question .
KATHRYN: Annette ?
SEBASTIAN: Devastated beyond repair . I doubt she 'll ever trust a man again .
KATHRYN: Well done . He holds up a bottle of champagne .
SEBASTIAN: I thought we should celebrate .
KATHRYN: I 'd love to , but unfortunately I 'm expecting some company .
SEBASTIAN: Ronald ?
KATHRYN: Not that it 's any of your business but yes . Sebastian holds up a letter .
SEBASTIAN: From Ronald . Kathryn takes the letter . SEBASTIAN I have n't had a chance to read it , but I 'm sure it goes something like `` yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me . Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be friends . Etcetera , etcetera , etcetera . '' You see , I expected your sort of ullshit so I took the liberty of phoning Ronald and Cecile . Right now they 're having a little get togethe in my love shack at the Grand Central Hyatt . I 'm so sorry he chose Cecile over you , but I promised him I would see you through your crisis .
KATHRYN: Well done .
SEBASTIAN: Thank you . Now , where were we ? POP goes the champagne cork . SEBASTIAN Oh yeah , the celebration .
KATHRYN: To my triumph , of course .
SEBASTIAN: Not my choice of toast , but it 's you call . To your triumph over Annette . Kathryn giggles . SEBASTIAN What 's so funny ?
KATHRYN: Silly rabbit . My triumph is n't over her . It 's over you .
SEBASTIAN: Come again ?
KATHRYN: You were very much in love with her and you 're still in love with her . But it amused me to make you ashamed of it . You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm flattered that you chose me over her , but please understand , I never loved you , Sebastian . You 're just a toy . A little toy I play with . And now you 've completely blown it with her . I think that 's the saddest thing I 've eve heard . Cheers .
SEBASTIAN: In any event , you still owe me my eward .
KATHRYN: I 'm sorry , but unfortunately I do n't fuck losers . Sebastian slaps her across the face . KATHRYN You motherfucker !
SEBASTIAN: Calm down .
KATHRYN: Get off me !
SEBASTIAN: Will you calm down ?
KATHRYN: Fine ! Get off me !
SEBASTIAN: I 'm very sorry about that . I apologize .
KATHRYN: I accept . Now get out .
SEBASTIAN: Get out ? We had an arrangement .
KATHRYN: Did n't you hear what I said ?
SEBASTIAN: I do n't care what you said , we had an agreement . You 've slept with half of the borough so do n't tell me you 're eing choosy .
KATHRYN: Get out !
SEBASTIAN: I 'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed .
KATHRYN: And if I do n't ?
SEBASTIAN: Then I will consider it a declaration of war . One . Two three .
KATHRYN: I think you have your answer .
SEBASTIAN: War it is .
MRS. O'SHEA: What do you want ?
SEBASTIAN: I need to talk to Annette .
MRS. O'SHEA: She 's not here .
SEBASTIAN: Do you know where she is ?
MRS. O'SHEA: She 's out .
SEBASTIAN: Do you know when she 'll be back ?
MRS. O'SHEA: Later . Listen , we 're entertaining some guests so -
SEBASTIAN: Annette ! Annette !
MRS. O'SHEA: Young man , I already told you she 's not here .
SEBASTIAN: Fine . Could you please see that she gets this . He hands her the package .
MRS. O'SHEA: I 'll do that .
SEBASTIAN: It 's really important .
MRS. O'SHEA: I understand . Good night . She closes the door .
RONALD: Hello .
KATHRYN: Ronald ?
RONALD: Yeah ?
KATHRYN: It 's Kathryn . Ronald sits up , nervous .
RONALD: Hi Kathryn . Is everything okay ?
KATHRYN: No . She cries .
RONALD: What 's wrong ?
KATHRYN: It 's Sebastian . He 's out of his mind .
RONALD: What do you mean ?
KATHRYN: I think he 's high on drugs . He hit me , then took off . I 'm afraid to be alone . Please come over .
RONALD: I 'll be right there . He hangs up the phone and grabs his pants
KATHRYN: And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business . Then when I said `` Well what about Ronald , '' he said you were nothing more than a stupid the n word and that you deserved what you got
RONALD: And this happened before you and I hooked up ?
KATHRYN: It 's been going on for a while . Then he called me a disgrace to ou family and that 's when he hit me .
RONALD: Racist piece of shit .
KATHRYN: I 'd be careful if I were you . God knows what he 's up to .
RONALD: He does n't scare me . I 'll kick his ass in .
KATHRYN: Will you stay here for the night ? You can leave in the morning . That 's when my parents get back and
RONALD: Do n't worry about it . I 'll stay . Kathryn hugs him .
KATHRYN: Thanks Ronald . You 're a good friend .
SEBASTIAN: What time is it ?
NIGHT DOORMAN: Eight o'clock . You got to go .
SEBASTIAN: Did she show up ?
NIGHT DOORMAN: Nope .
SEBASTIAN: Do you mind if I check upstairs ?
NIGHT DOORMAN: I ca n't have you do that , nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day .
SEBASTIAN: I understand . Thanks for letting me crash here .
NIGHT DOORMAN: Do n't worry about it .

SEBASTIAN: Can we do it later . I 've had a really ad night and - Ronald SHOVES Sebastian . SEBASTIAN What 's your problem ?
RONALD: Where the hell do you come off hitting women ?
SEBASTIAN: What are you talking about ?
RONALD: Kathryn . Did you hit her ?
SEBASTIAN: Kathryn ? Oh Christ , she got to you too ?
RONALD: Did you hit her ?
SEBASTIAN: Ronald , you do n't know what you 're talking about .
RONALD: Do n't know what I 'm talking about ? I know that you fucked Cecile . Sebastian says nothing . RONALD It 's true , is n't it ?
SEBASTIAN: Ronald , I 'm sorry .
RONALD: You bastard !
SEBASTIAN: Fuck you .
ANNETTE: Sebastian !
SEBASTIAN: I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Ronald and the Cab driver run over to them .
ANNETTE: Get an ambulance !
SEBASTIAN: Holy shit . ANNETTE You 're gon na be fine . Sebastian nods .
MRS. CALDWELL: Sad , sad , sad . To think of the opportunities that boy had . This should e a lesson to us all that our children need constant supervision . She puts her arm around Cecile .
ANNETTE: I can see why . Kathryn extends her hand .
KATHRYN: I 'm Kathryn .
ANNETTE: Annette Harrison . They shake .
KATHRYN: Have we met ?
ANNETTE: I do n't think so .
KATHRYN: Did you know Sebastian well ?
ANNETTE: You might say that .
KATHRYN: Now I remember . Annette Harrison . You father 's the new headmaster at Oakwood .

KATHRYN: I 'm sure you 're going to love it there . Annette nods .
ANNETTE: I 'll be fine .
KATHRYN: Well , I 'll leave you alone now . I just came in here to get something of mine .
ANNETTE: Thank you .
KATHRYN: Look , I know this sounds corny , but whenever I feel like I ca n't go on I turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem . Call me an anachronism , ut -
ANNETTE: Oh cut the shit , Kathryn .
KATHRYN: Excuse me ?
ANNETTE: You heard me .
KATHRYN: Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me . My brother is dead , have some respect .

ANNETTE: I have his journal .
KATHRYN: You what ?
ANNETTE: His journal . He sent it to me the day efore he died . Everything about you is in it .

RICK: Seventy-two cents . Here 's two- fifty .
MS. HEATH: You 're still short .
RICK: I know and I 'm working on that .
MS. HEATH: May I remind you that we 're not a charity ? If you need credit go to a ank . I run a reputable business and I need the balance by next Wednesday , or maybe you should consider other arrangements .
KRIS: I did n't do it .
MOTHER: What happened ? Where is he ? Is he going to be okay ?
RICK: He 's going to be fine . They 're working on him now . From what they told me it 's just a few stitches .
FATHER: Boys will be boys . A NURSE peeks out .
NURSE: Mr. Stevens can you come back ? The doctor could use your help in calming the child down .
RICK: Mom ?
MOTHER: Just go . I 'll watch these two .
DOCTOR: Thank God .
RICK: How can I help ?
DOCTOR: Well , I need to give him a local so that I can sew the laceration , but he 's not cooperating . Maybe hold his hand and distract him ? Rick moves to Phillip .
RICK: Hi little buddy .
PHILLIP: Hi Daddy .
RICK: I need you to be a good boy , okay ?
PHILLIP: Okay daddy .
RICK: So , did you have fun today .
PHILLIP: Uh huh .
RICK: Did you play with all your friends ?
PHILLIP: Uh huh .
RICK: Phillip !
PHILLIP: But daddy , it does .
RICK: That 's a big people word . You 're a little people , and little people do n't use big people words .
PHILLIP: Okay .
RICK: I 'm sorry .
PHILLIP: Do that again and my daddy 's going to kick your ass .
RICK: Look I 'm really sorry .
DOCTOR: Can I ask you something ?
RICK: Sure , I guess .
DOCTOR: My son 's a wuss . He cries ove hangnails . My wife and I have tried everything to toughen him up , but nothing works . I was wondering if our kids could play together . Maybe some of Phillip 's `` boy '' would ru off on Junior .
RICK: Insurance ?
RECEPTIONIST: Yeah , Insurance . That thing that covers medical emergencies ?
RICK: I do n't think I have any .
RECEPTIONIST: Everybody has insurance .
RICK: I do n't think I do .
RECEPTIONIST: Okay .
RICK: Can I run a tab ?
RECEPTIONIST: You do n't have a check ?
RICK: I 'm not even responsible fo myself . How am I suppose to raise three kids ?
MOTHER: It can be done .
RICK: I do n't see how .
MOTHER: Find a way . Everything happens fo a reason . God does n't abandon his children , and neither will you .
RICK: God does n't pay day-care .
MOTHER: There are other things out there less expensive ways .
RICK: Could you watch them ?
MOTHER: Oh uh well I do n't think your father is willing to do that . We raised our kids , Rick .
RICK: How ` bout tonight , so I can catch a eath ?
MOTHER: What ? My watching them while you were in there with Phillip was n't enough ? Make me feel guilty .
RICK: I 'll just ask God to watch them . He never abandons his children .
MOTHER: Take this .
RICK: I do n't want your money mom .
MOTHER: Take the money .
NICHOLAS: I ca n't do it Daddy .
RICK: You can do it .
NICHOLAS: I ca n't do it .
RICK: Would you do it for a nickel ?
NICHOLAS: I ca n't do it .
RICK: Watch daddy .
NICHOLAS: Daddy ?
RICK: Yes , Nicky ?
NICHOLAS: I peed .
RICK: Hi .
MELANIE: I 'm Melanie The baby-sitter
RICK: Oh , right , I 'm glad you could
NICHOLAS: My daddy has a big pee-pee .
RICK: I was just demonstrating the art of
MELANIE: It 's okay . I saw .
RICK: Great .
MELANIE: So do you .
RICK: Not criticizing , just surprised . I do n't believe anyone at their old day-care had kids . If they did they kept them in a closet and only ought them out on special occasions . Christmas , Easter , an occasional birthday , and maybe when they had friends over for dinner , ut only as a status symbol . It was like they 'd say , `` Here 's the white picket fence . Here 's the SUV . Here 's the dog . Oh yes , here 's the 2.5 children . Kids you can get back in the closet now . ''
MELANIE: You 'd could make a fortune with a Renta- Kid business .
RICK: That has potential .
MELANIE: I 've often thought of renting mine . Why pay for a baby-sitter when thousands of people would pay good money to set your kid on the mantle for a few hours ?
RICK: So , what 's his name ?
ZACH: I 'm Zach .
RICK: Hello Zach . I 'm Rick .
ZACH: You 're old .
RICK: You got me there . I am old .
ZACH: How old ?
RICK: Older than dirt . When I was a kid we did n't have dirt . We had rocks and we had hammers . If we wanted dirt we banged a few rocks with eally big hammers , and then we had dirt .
MELANIE: Worked the chain gangs ?
ZACH: You 're too old for my mom .
RICK: This is Kristian . This is Phillip , and the little guy from the potty , is Nicholas . Guys , this is Zach and
MELANIE: Mel .
RICK: Mel .
MELANIE: Beautiful kids .
RICK: Thanks . So 's your 's .
MELANIE: Ever try Cheerios ?
RICK: Huh ?
MELANIE: For potty training . Give him something to aim at . Drop a Cheerio or two in the toilet and let him pee away .
RICK: I 'll have to try that . So , any questions about the job ? Melanie moves towards the boys .
MELANIE: I 'm going to go talk to them for a little bit . I 'll let you know .
ZACH: My mom tells great stories .
KRIS: We do n't have a mom .
ZACH: That 's okay , I do n't have a dad .
MELANIE: Once upon a time
RICK: You have a real knack there .
MELANIE: Not a knack really . It 's just about finding hope in places there should e none .
RICK: Whatever it is , I 've never seen them take to a woman like that . Melanie smiles .
MELANIE: I 'd like that .
WOMAN: You 're really funny and kinda cute .
RICK: Maybe we should
WOMAN: Go out sometime ? I 'd like that . When ?
RICK: I do n't know maybe
WOMAN: Tonight ?
MELANIE: No problem .
KRIS: Who was that ?
MELANIE: That was your daddy .
PHILLIP: I love daddy .
KRIS: Is he coming home ?
MELANIE: No , he 's going to be late . He has a date .
WOMAN: You 're a single father ? That 's wonderful . So many men refuse to accept any responsibility for thei kids . So , how many do you have ?
RICK: Um three .
WOMAN: That 's amazing . I 'm sure they 're just angels .
RICK: Um kinda .
WOMAN: You 're a terrific man . Did I tell you I love kids ? They love me . It just comes so instinctively even though I 've never had kids myself . I get lots of practice with my nephews though . So , when can I meet your boys ?
KRIS: You 're not my mom .
RICK: You ca n't .
WOMAN 2: A guy like you is so hard to find . I think I love you and I think you need to love me too .
RICK: That was incredible .
WOMAN 3: Yeah .
RICK: I know I have n't known you very long , but I there 's something I need to say
MELANIE: Did you have a good time ?
RICK: Yeah , it was good kinda okay pretty much sucked .
MELANIE: What happened ?
RICK: Why ca n't I find a woman like you ?
MELANIE: You 're trying too hard .
RICK: I feel bad for the boys . They do n't have a `` mom '' . She 'll always be their mother , but she 'll never be their mom .
MELANIE: Quit trying so hard . You 're forcing issues that ca n't be forced . Relax . Everything happens when and how it 's suppose to . It 's about spirit and finding the will to love again , for you and the boys .
RICK: You want to stay and
MELANIE: I 'm going to get
RICK: Going ?
MELANIE: Yeah .
RICK: You sure ?
MELANIE: Positive .
RICK: Ok .
NICHOLAS: Nicky almost do 'd it .
RICK: Almost , baby boy . Almost .
CARRIE: Finally had to grow up ?
RICK: Yeah , I
JOHN: You 've got direction .
RICK: I suppose . I do n't know if you 'd call it direction , but there 's a definite sense of purpose .
CARRIE: Good for you .
RICK: Yeah , but is it good for the kids ?
JOHN: Do the kids have direction ?
RICK: Only two kinds of people make it in this world , boy ; Those that are smart and those that are strong . If you do n't want to be smart and do your homework then you can be strong and do pushups .
JOHN: You have to instill a sense of direction at a very early age .
MOTHER: So , Phillip what do you want to be when you grow up ?
PHILLIP: Daddy says I can do three things when I grow up .
MOTHER: And what are those ? Phillip takes a deep breath .
PHILLIP: I can go to college and move the hell out of his house . I can join the military and move the hell out of his house , or I can get a jo and
RICK: move the hell out of my house .
MOTHER: Rick !
RICK: Ya got ta let them be what they 're going to be .
JOHN: No , you have to mold them early . If you do n't mold them they 'll grow up to be Democrats .
RICK: And you do this with your kids ?
JOHN: That 's not the point , is it , Carrie ?
CARRIE: I think Rick is doing a wonderful job .
RICK: It 's a struggle , going at it alone , ut
CARRIE: Excuse me , gentleman , I need to powder my nose .
JOHN: I ca n't believe you .
RICK: What ?
JOHN: Whining about being single . Married men would kill to be in you situation !
RICK: I 'm just saying it 's hard .
JOHN: You have your sons to raise without feminine interference . Do you understand the significance of you situation ? Do you understand the power in your circumstance ?
RICK: It does have its advantages , I suppose .
JOHN: Another ?
RICK: Uh
JOHN: On me .
RICK: Sure .
CARRIE: You know Rick , someday some girl is going to realize what a good man you are .
RICK: Carrie , I do n't even have the funds to buy my own beer .
CARRIE: Love is n't about money . Love is about truth and selflessness and discovering who you are and who 'll e. Someday , someone will find you .
MELANIE: I 'll call you back .
RICK: For finding me .
NICHOLAS: Have to potty , daddy .
RICK: Go potty , buddy .
FRANK: Where are you going ? What will you do ?
RICK: I do n't know , Frank , but I 'm worth more than this .
PHILLIP: Well , I wanted that piece and Kris took that piece , and I really , eally wanted that piece .
MELANIE: What 's so important about that piece ?
KRIS: It 's bigger .
RICK: Easy on the drinks guys .
MELANIE: What 's wrong , Phillip ?
PHILLIP: I got ta pee and Kris
RICK: We 're not going to fight over the athroom .
MELANIE: What 's that ?
RICK: Huh ? Oh , this ? Nothing !
PHILLIP: This time mine 's bigger .
RICK: I took off work to be here .
CINDY: Thank you .
RICK: So , what do you want ?
CINDY: I want to see your boys .
RICK: I do n't think that 's a good idea .
CINDY: I 'm their mother .
RICK: You forfeited that obligation , emember ?
CINDY: That 's not fair !
RICK: You abandoned your kids !
CINDY: I did not . I left them in the care of their loving father . There 's a difference .
RICK: Is there ?
CINDY: I just want to see the boys .
RICK: You think they even know who you are ?
CINDY: I 'm their mother .
RICK: You keep saying that .
CINDY: I know things can never go back to the way they were before .
MAN: Next
CINDY: Rick ? Rick ? Rick ?
RICK: Huh ?
CINDY: Let 's keep the attorneys out of this and settle things like civil adults .
RICK: Hi guys .
MELANIE: This is a surprise . Leave work to spend the day with us ?
RICK: Come on guys . Someone is here to see you .
MELANIE: Rick ? Rick ?
CINDY: Thank you .
RICK: Three hours .
CINDY: They 'll be here .
RICK: Where are you going .
MELANIE: Anywhere you 're not .
RICK: What about the boys ? What about me ?
MELANIE: I 'm all about second chances , but not when I come in second place .
RICK: What are you talking about ?
MELANIE: Why was she here ? What was that ?
RICK: She 's their mother .
MELANIE: Mother ? I 've been more of a mothe than she ever was .
RICK: She 's their mother .
MELANIE: Who willingly walked out of thei lives .
RICK: She 's their mother .
MELANIE: You keep saying that .
RICK: You think this is easy ? You think aising these boys is something I want to do alone ? Every day is like a prison sentence . Every thing I do , every decision I make is directly affected by the boundaries of my responsibility . I have three children , but I have no me . Everywhere I go people stare at me
PEDESTRIAN: You poor , poor man . You poor , poo children . How unfortunate to only have your father . How terrible it must be not to know your mother .
MELANIE: What about Zach ? How noble of you to be the only single parent in the world . How stoic you are so concerned with the best interests of your children . Too bad . Thei est interest is walking out the door .
KRIS: When can we see you again ?
CINDY: Someday .
PHILLIP: Is someday tomorrow ?
CINDY: Someday is someday , baby .
RICK: Give your Mom a hug , guys , then get in the house .
CINDY: I 'm sorry .
RICK: For ?
CINDY: I thought things had changed .
RICK: But ?
CINDY: I am who I am , Rick . I 'm not cut out to be a mommy .
RICK: I could have told you that .
CINDY: I had to give it a shot . Rick turns to walk away .
RICK: At whose expense ? Huh , Cindy ? At whose expense ? Who 's going to dry their tears tomorrow when they ealize your never coming back ? Who 's going to rock them to sleep at night when they ask why mommy does n't love them ?
CINDY: You are , and you would n't have it any other way .
PHILLIP: Is Mel coming today ?
RICK: I do n't know , buddy .
NICHOLAS: Daddy ?
RICK: Yes Nicky ?
NICHOLAS: I love Mel .
RICK: She loves you too .
KRIS: Dad ?
RICK: Yeah ?
KRIS: Phillip 's in the closet
RICK: What were you doing in there ?
PHILLIP: Being Daddy .
RICK: Who locked the door ?
KRIS: Was n't me
PHILLIP: I did .
MOTHER: Rick ? Rick ? Rick ?
FATHER: What are you giving him money for ?
MOTHER: To help him through the hard times . He 's a good father , just having a ough go .
FATHER: I 've never met a good father that could n't support his kids .
MOTHER: I 'm too old for that . The bette side of life has passed me by . What if they fall ? I do n't hear like I used to . What if one of them was seriously hurt and I did n't hea their cry ? I hate that the only thing I feel competent to do is give them money . I love my son and I love my grandbabies , but how would I live with myself if something happened to those children ?
REPRESENTATIVE: Sir , you 're 3 months behind on you electric bill .
JAILER: I always knew you were a lifer .
ADOPTION AGENT: Because of their age it may take awhile . We 'll start them out in foster care , but eventually they 'll all be placed in loving , nurturing environments .
RICK: They 'll be together though , right ?
ADOPTION AGENT: Mr. Stevens , I wish I could make that promise , but the odds of an adoptive family willing to take them all is astronomical .
RICK: Come on guys we 're out of here .
ADOPTION AGENT: Mr. Stevens ?
RICK: I 'm sorry , I made a mistake .
CONVICT: Can you help him ?
RICK: I do n't know .
CONVICT: What does he need ?
RICK: I do n't know .
CONVICT: He needs a father , not a book eading baby-sitter .
RICK: I ca n't fucking do this .
CONVICT: Yes you can .
RICK: But I
CONVICT: Use what you have . There is a vein of wealth inside you just waiting to be mined . Think differently than you have ever thought before . Worker harder than you ever thought you could . Love these children like they 've never been loved before .
RICK: How ?
CONVICT: The answer lies within . Quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart . Quit dwelling on all of you misgivings . Look around you . You 're not alone . But you , and you alone , will make the difference .
RICK: It 's not worth a lot , maybe a few hundred bucks , but it might keep you in soap for a year .
CASE WORKER: Mr. Stevens , I can see you now . Rick and the Pregnant Woman lock eyes .
PREGNANT WOMAN: I ai n't some charity case . I know what you think when you look at me . You think ; Look at that poor , poo woman . Look at those poor , poo children . How unfortunate it must e that they only have a mother . How terrible it must be not to know their father .
CASE WORKER: Mr. Stevens ?
RICK: I did n't mean it like that ?
PREGNANT WOMAN: No one ever does .
CASE WORKER: Mr. Stevens ?
RICK: I 'm sorry , I 'm going to have to eschedule .
CASE WORKER: Excuse me ?
RICK: Responsibility calls .
NICHOLAS: Please daddy ? Please ? Rick opens the book so all can see .
RICK: Once upon a time
NICHOLAS: Daddy , I 'm hungry .
PHILLIP: Daddy , I 'm thirsty . Rick takes a long look at his beer .
RICK: Get your coats on .
KRIS: We 're leaving guys .
CLERK: Thirty-two hundred and fifty-six dollars .
OLDER WOMAN: Think it 's bad now ? Wait til they 're teenagers .
RICK: Mom , I have an idea , but I need your help .
MOTHER: What do you need .
RICK: For you to believe in me .
MELANIE: I know you .
CINDY: Excuse me ?
MELANIE: Rick 's ex-wife ?
CINDY: And you are ?
MELANIE: Can I ask you a question ? What is Phillip 's favorite color ?
CINDY: Huh ?
MELANIE: Blue . His favorite color is blue . How many teeth has Kris lost ?
CINDY: I do n't know . Why ?
MELANIE: Four . Two on top and two on bottom . He got a quarter for the first one , fifty cents for the next two and he parlayed the last into an even dollar . Nicholas cries at night ecause he thinks the house is filled with ghosts . Kiss him once on the forehead , once on the cheek and sing The Cradle Will Rock and he 'll sleep the whole night through . Kris ' favorite subject is math . He loves to read and write , ut he does n't do so well in social studies . He knows how to ride a ike . Why ? Because I taught him . Phillip wants to learn but he 's always afraid he 'll fall . Nicky just likes to Flintstone his tricycle . Phillip 's favorite cartoon is Tunenami .
CINDY: What 's your point ?
MELANIE: I 'm more their mom than you 'll eve e .
CINDY: So , why are you here with slick and not with `` your '' kids ?
MELANIE: Things change .
CINDY: Yeah yeah they do . Now if you 'll excuse me I need to find the asparagus . I could n't do it , ya know ?
MELANIE: Do what ?
CINDY: I always thought I wanted to be a parent , and I was really good at eing pregnant , but I sucked as a mom . I know that now . I do n't have what it takes .
MELANIE: I do n't think I 've ever felt as much pity for anyone as I do fo you right now .
CINDY: Take care of my boys all of them .
RICK: Well , guys , I guess this is it .
KRIS: We can do it daddy .
RICK: Yes we can .
CLIMBER: You can do it .
RICK: Yes we can .
KRIS: Look daddy .
PHILLIP: We can do it .
RICK: Yes we can .
KRIS: Hey !
BOYFRIEND: What 's wrong ? What did I do ?
MELANIE: Not you , it 's me .
BOYFRIEND: What then ?
MELANIE: I 'm sorry .
RICK: Put the stone down .
PHILLIP: But
RICK: No buts Put the stone down .
RESTING CLIMBER: Long way up .
RICK: Yeah .
RESTING CLIMBER: Long way down for that matter .
RICK: That too .
RESTING CLIMBER: No point , just an observation . Drink ?
RICK: I 'm okay .
RESTING CLIMBER: For the boys .
NICHOLAS: Daddy , I 'm thirsty . Rick studies the climber for a moment .
RICK: Go ahead .
RESTING CLIMBER: You know , if you stop here , halfway etween a long way up and a long way down you really have n't accomplished much , have you ?
RICK: We 're not stopping . We 're just esting .
RESTING CLIMBER: That 's what I said , fourteen years ago . Rick looks toward the top .
RICK: We can do this .
RESTING CLIMBER: Yes you can .
RICK: We can do this !
PROSECUTOR: What is so important Mr. Stevens that you would burden this court with convening today ?
RICK: I just needed clarification .
PROSECUTOR: On what , Mr. Stevens ? On what ?
RICK: I know if I have to , I can do this alone , but do I have to do this alone ? A hushed MURMUR rises in the audience . The Judge RAPS his gavel on the bench .
JUDGE: Order in this court ! A beat as things quiet down .
RICK: I do n't know .
PROSECUTOR: He does n't know . He just does n't know .
RICK: I do n't know .
JUDGE: Then this court sees no reason to amend the original verdict . The order stands .
RICK: But
PROSECUTOR: Tell it to someone who cares , Mr. Stevens .
RICK: I have . I have laid my heart out on the line time and time again , only to walk away empty handed . This love , this caring , this sharing of life , it 's a sentence and my heart has been condemned . It does n't matter who I 've told , what 's in my heart is never quite enough . The people I have cared for most have shunned me in life and in love . Unanswered phone calls Unnoticed displays of affection A rose that withers on the doorstep No matter what I do , it 's neve enough . Just once , just one fucking time , I want to be enough .
PROSECUTOR: Your only condemnation is self- pity . You have people that care all around you , but you 're too blind to see them . If you do n't pull yourself together soon , my friend , they soon will all be gone .
MELANIE: What do you want ?
RICK: I 'm a proud man , sometimes foolish .
MELANIE: Go on .
RICK: I have a long way to go before I could ever be the man you need me to be .
MELANIE: And ?
RICK: And I got confused between what I should have done and what I thought was right .
MELANIE: Yes you did .
RICK: I put you on a pedestal and then I knocked you down . It was n't fair .
MELANIE: Life 's not fair Rick .
RICK: You were more a mother to my boys than they have ever known . You were more a woman to me than I have eve deserved .
MELANIE: You 're right .
RICK: You 're not going to make this easy , are you ?
MELANIE: Cut the bullshit , Rick .
RICK: I can live my life alone . I can aise my kids alone . I can walk this path alone . I 'd much rather do it with you .
MELANIE: I ca n't .
RICK: Ca n't ?
MELANIE: I wo n't .
RICK: I should n't have come here .
MELANIE: No , you should n't have .
RICK: Get what ?
MELANIE: You 're here for you , you selfish prick .
KRIS: I could have looked sad .
PHILLIP: I can look sad too .
KRIS: But I look sadder .
NICHOLAS: I sad .
PHILLIP: Do n't quit , daddy .
KRIS: Daddy does n't quit .
JOHN: You love her ?
RICK: I think so I do n't know .
JOHN: If you think you 're in love you are .
RICK: I suppose I am .
JOHN: Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by ?
RICK: She 's my best friend or was .
JOHN: Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by ?
RICK: Yes .
JOHN: Do your palms sweat when you think about her ?
RICK: Yes .
JOHN: Does she inspire you ?
RICK: With music and poetry .
JOHN: And is there passion ?
RICK: There 's fire .
JOHN: And have you ever told her this ?
RICK: She knows .
JOHN: Have you ever told her this ?
RICK: No .
JOHN: Do n't you think you should ?
RICK: It only confuses things .
JOHN: Loving your best friend confuses things ? I ca n't think of a love more lucid . Rick stands to leave .
RICK: You did n't marry your best friend ?
JOHN: No .
RICK: I thought you had things all planned out .
JOHN: Affairs of the heart and those of the mind are two different things .
RICK: It 's not too late , you know ?
MOTHER: But you 're father
FATHER: Woman , enough .
MOTHER: But
FATHER: No more excuses . It 's time to live life and enjoy our grandkids . Go . The boys will be fine .
MOTHER: Ca n't we just give him money to pay for a baby-sitter ?
MELANIE: Oh shit .
CUSTOMER: Whoa !
MELANIE: Sorry .
CUSTOMER: Pay attention , would ya ?
MELANIE: What do you want ?
RICK: To talk .
MELANIE: I 'm working .
RICK: I know .
MELANIE: So , where are the boys ?
RICK: They 're at my parents .
MELANIE: What ? Not going to use them to try to persuade me with guilt ?
RICK: Is that what you thought ?
MELANIE: I have a son of my own . I know when people are using their kids .
CUSTOMER 2: Ma'am .
RICK: Excuse us for a moment okay ?
CUSTOMER 2: I 'd just like some coffee .
RICK: What is your problem ?
CUSTOMER 2: Cold .
RICK: What ?
CUSTOMER 2: The coffee , it 's cold .
RICK: Quit your bitching .
MELANIE: I ca n't believe you came here .
RICK: I ca n't believe you 're a waitress .
MELANIE: Beats chasing around after snot nosed brats all day .
RICK: I thought you liked my kids .
MELANIE: I was talking about you .
RICK: I deserved that .
MELANIE: So , what do the kids need ? A abysitter ? A surrogate mom ?
RICK: This is n't about the kids .
MELANIE: Then what 's it about ?
RICK: It 's about me , the selfish prick .
MELANIE: About you ?
RICK: Hear me out , okay ?
MELANIE: You have 15 seconds .
RICK: Okay , okay .
MELANIE: Ten .
RICK: Melanie , there is a grace about you that reminds me how clumsy I am . There is an honesty about you that eminds me how deceitful I can be . There is a beauty in your eyes that eminds me how ugly I 've become . There is a kindness in your voice that contradicts my coarseness . There is a glow around you that illuminates my dullness . There is spirit in you that challenges my laziness , but most of all , there is a woman in you , that sparks my desire , a desire to be graceful and honest and beautiful and kind . A desire to be better than I am o ever thought I could be .
MELANIE: Go on .
RICK: I think my ten seconds are up .
MELANIE: Who 's counting ?
CUSTOMER 2: Miss My coffee ?
MELANIE: Get it yourself .
RICK: I love you .
MELANIE: I do n't think I heard you .
RICK: If I give you my heart will you promise to treat it softly ? Kiss it when it hurts ? Put it in a box and know that it belongs to you ?
MELANIE: That 's not what you said .
RICK: I said I love you .
MELANIE: As brutal as that can be ?
RICK: I love you . I love you , I love you , I love you .
MELANIE: I kind of like you too .
RICK: Been waiting long ?
MELANIE: I never thought you 'd find me .
RICK: I had to find me first . I hope you plan on walking , cause I 'm not sure I can carry you .
MELANIE: So , how do we do this ? The two egin the ascent together .
RICK: One step at a time ?
MELANIE: Side by side ?
RICK: Maybe you could carry me ?
JAILER: Getting out of here , huh ?
RICK: It 's time to move on .
