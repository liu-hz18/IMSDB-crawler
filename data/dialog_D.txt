RON: It 's called a newspaper . You heard of it ?
ROG: Who the hell 's Rock Hudson ?
RON: Calm the nerves , brother . You look great . T.J. takes a swig , gives him a look .
TUCKER: Fuck off , Woodroof .
RON: Come on , man . I 'm serious ! Tuck sees the angry mob approaching .
TUCKER: Looks like you got a few pissed off customers .
RON: You gon na cuff me or what ?
TUCKER: Figure it out yourself .

TUCKER: Get the fuck outta my car .
RON: You rattled my fuckin ' brain .
TUCKER: What brain ?
RON: That shit is purer than a preache daughter 's pussy .
CLINT: Not after you just coughed your lungs all over it .
RON: What do you wan na go work for a buncha sand niggas for ?
FOREMAN: Woodroof , there 's been an accident on platform five . They need an electrician ight away !
RON: Dumb spic . How 'd you get your leg in there ?
FOREMAN: He 's illegal .
RON: Go call ` em . Go FUCKING call ` em .
RICK FERRIS: With the onset of HIV , however , we at Barrow Wilkem began a trial in which we administered AZT to infected lab animals . Initial findings suggested increased CD4 counts , restored T-cell immunity and also evidence of inducing weight gain .
SEVARD: Is n't it also true that it had some concerning side effects in animal tests , significantly decreasing the animals red and white blood cells ?
RICK FERRIS: Yes , but its effect on the virus is etter than anything else that 's been tested .
EVE: In 64 , when AZT was developed for cance treatment , it was shelved due to lack of anti cancer efficacy and toxicity .
RICK FERRIS: We believe those problems were dosage ased .
EVE: So you 're conducting another animal study ?
RICK FERRIS: Actually the FDA has given us permission to go straight to human trials which is what brings me here today . We 're conducting a double-blind , placebo- controlled randomized trial throughout the United States . Dallas Mercy is one of the proposed sites .
EVE: How long do you see the study going on ?
RICK FERRIS: We 're hoping to fast track it within a year ? During which time the hospital and its administering physicians will be very well compensated for their efforts .
EVE: Does it not drive you just a little bit crazy when these guys stand up there talking about curing the sick while they 're flashing gold Rolexes ? What do they know about sick patients ?
DR. SEVARD: They 're pharma reps , not doctors . And like it or not , this is a business .
EVE: Blood tests .
RON: What kinda blood tests , cause I do n't use drugs .
EVE: We did n't test you for drugs .
RON: Good , cause that ai n't none of ye usiness anyway .
DR. SEVARD: You 've tested positive for HIV Ron looks at Dr. Sevard blankly .
RON: Who you kidding , Rock cock sucking Hudson ullshit ? !
DR. SEVARD: Have you ever used intravenous drugs o had any homosexual
RON: Homo ? Homo ? That 's what you said , ight ? Shit . You got ta be kidding me . I ai n't no faggot , I do n't even know any faggots , I 'm a rodeo ! The room is silent .
DR. SEVARD: Your T-cell count is down to nine , a healthy person has five hundred to fifteen hundred .
RON: What the fuck 's a three-Cell ? !
DR. SEVARD: T-cell . Frankly we 're surprised you 're alive .
RON: Well surprise this you 've made a fuckin ' mistake !
EVE: We ran the blood test several times .
DR. SEVARD: Mr. Woodroof , we 're trying to impress upon you the gravity of your situation .
RON: Thirty days ? Ron jumps off the examining table .
KELLY: You said we would be dancin ' by nine . T.J. smiles at Ron .
RON: I 'll catch up with you .
NURSE FRAZIN: Dr. Sevard 's not on today .
RON: Do I look like I can wait til tomorrow ?
NURSE FRAZIN: If you 'll tell me what the problem is
RON: Problem ? Which problem you want to hea about ? My lungs bleeding , my skin crawling , the jackhammer in my head hell that 's just the beginning of my problems sweetheart .
EVE: Mr. Woodroof ? Ron turns around .
RON: I do n't want no nurse . I want a doctor . A goddamn doctor ! Today ! NOW ! The Orderly watches Ron and Eve .
EVE: Fine . How can I help you ?
RON: Are you fuckin ' deaf , lady ?
EVE: No . I 'm a fucking doctor !
RON: Twenty minutes ? I like your style , Doctor . Ron watches her as she walks away .
EVE: That is n't how it works . For about a year , a group of patients will either get the drug or a placebo , it 's left up to chance , not even the doctors are allowed to know .
RON: You give dyin ' people sugar pills ?
EVE: It 's the only way to know if a drug works .
RON: Can you get it for me ?
EVE: Unfortunately no . But when it 's proven to work and if you fit the profile , then yes .
RON: So , you 're tellin ' me I 'm as good as a horse being sold for dog food ?
EVE: None of those drugs have been approved by the FDA .
RON: Screw the FDA , I 'm gon na be DOA . Do I have to sue this hospital to get me some medicine ?
EVE: Mr. Woodroof , I assure you that would be a waste of precious time . Ron takes a moment , eases up .
RON: Call me Ron , will ya ?
EVE: There is a support group that meets every day at Draddy Auditorium , perhaps you could share your feelings and concerns Ron abruptly stands .
RON: I 'm dying and you 're tellin ' me to go get a hug from a bunch of faggots ? Eve watches as Ron backs away .
CLINT: Get me another beer , will you sweetheart ? The guys burst out laughing .
RON: ` Fuck you say ?
CLINT: I said grab me a cold one , cupcake . Ron looks at him incredulously .
RON: You askin ' me to kick yer ass ?
CLINT: Nah , would n't wan na get none of that faggot blood on me .
RON: Where you goin ' , bud ? I thought you 're my friend .
RICK FERRIS: In short , I 'm happy to say that help may finally be on the way .
EFFEMINATE MAN: It 's okay brother . We 're all getting
RON: Tooth fairy , if we were n't in a public place right now , your teeth would be so far down your throat you 'd be usin ' you ass to chew food .
RICK FERRIS: The FDA standard procedure to approve a new drug is eight to twelve years -
EFFEMINATE MAN: Is it true you can get it in Mexico ? !
RON: I need to slow it down a second , catch my eath . I 'm not ready to crawl into a corner . You hear that ? I 'm not fucking eady . Man , if you 're up there you etter be listening .
STRIPPER: If you 're not gon na look or buy a dance , you could at least tip me .
RON: I 'll take a dance , but not fer me . Just shake it , he 'll see you . Ron looks heavenward .
EVE: You missed your last trial appointment .
RAYON: Do you like this blouse ? Cause I think the neckline 's too low .
EVE: Rayon , the whole point of this study is to determine whether AZT is helping people .
RAYON: Come on , Evie , you know there ai n't no helpin ' me .
EVE: That does n't mean I 'm going to stop trying .
RAYON: Why you so good to me ?
HISPANIC ORDERLY: There ai n't no more , they started lockin ' it up .
RON: I got more cash .
ORDERLY: Here . In Mexico . A doctor , he has some . Ron takes the paper , looks at it .
RON: What the hell is this bullshit ?
EVE: You 're in the hospital .
RON: I 'm sure that did n't surprise anyone . Eve seems to smile behind her mask .
DR. SEVARD: Dealing in pharmaceutical drugs is illegal . Ron I do n't know what you 're talking about . Dr. Sevard shakes his head and walks out .
EVE: Get some rest . She follows Sevard out of the room .
RON: Wait . We were just gettin ' somewhere .
RAYON: I 'm Rayon . Rayon gets up and goes over to Ron 's bed .
RON: Congratulations , fuck you and go back to your bed .
RAYON: Relax , I do n't bite . Rayon looks Ron over .
RON: Get the fuck outta here , whatever you are .
RAYON: Sticks and stones , cowboy . You wan na play cards ?
RON: You got cash ?
RAYON: Full house . Jacks over threes .
RON: I'da figured you for queens .
RAYON: Sorry darlin ' .
RON: Jesus Christ , I 'm straight , OK ! Rayon leaves Ron alone . An awkward beat .
RAYON: The AZT trial . My friend is paying me to split my dose with him . That way we 'll oth get some .
RON: How much is he paying you ?
RAYON: Five grand .
RON: What ?
RAYON: I coulda charged him twenty .
RON: How about me ? Will you sell me some ?
RAYON: Sorry , sweetie . I made a deal .
EVE: Where are you going ?
RON: I signed myself out .
EVE: You 're too sick to leave here .
RON: The worst-case scenario bein ' what ?
EVE: We can keep you comfortable at least .
RON: Thanks , but I prefer to die with my oots on .
EVE: As your doctor , I can not recommend you to do this .
RON: Well as my doctor , can you get me some damn AZT ?
DR. VASS: You have something for me to sign ?
RON: I 'm lookin ' for Dr. Vass . Dr. Vass steps over .
DR. VASS: Speak up .
RON: I 'm lookin ' for Vass , for some AZT .
DR. VASS: Looking to poison yourself ?
VASS: Who stacked those boxes there ? Check in with a nurse . Dr. Vass is off , ripping open boxes .
DR. VASS: Cocaine , alcohol , methamphetamine , AZT . That 's what I call a recipe for disaster .
RON: Doc , this place is a shit-hole .
DR. VASS: Who said I was a Doctor ? They revoked my license to practice three years ago , that 's why I 'm down in this shit-hole .
RON: Why ? What 'd you do ?
DR. VASS: I did n't play ball . Ron smiles .
RON: So cocaine gave me pneumonia ?
DR. VASS: Cocaine made you more susceptible . As did AZT .
RON: I thought AZT 's supposed to help me .
DR. VASS: The only people AZT helps are the people who sell it . It kills every cell it comes in contact with , good and bad .
RON: So medically speakin ' , I kicked my own ass !
DR. VASS: I 'm prescribing a regimen of vitamins as well as the mineral zinc to build you immune system back up . You 'll also be taking Aloe and essential fatty acids .
RON: Well ?
DR. VASS: Better . Your T-Cell count 's improving .
RON: Am I still positive for HIV ?
DR. VASS: You 'll always test positive for HIV , and now , you have AIDS , due the toxic shit you 've been pumping into your body , all the drugs , plus the AZT .
RON: If it sucks , I got it .
DR. VASS: This is DDC , it works as an anti viral similar to AZT but less toxic . And this is Peptide T , it 's a protein totally non-toxic . Early studies have shown it can help with all of that . This is what I had you on since you got here .
RON: And you ca n't buy them back in the U.S. ?
DR. VASS: No , not approved .
RON: Chinks , homos and herbs , you got a new world order here , Vass . You could be makin ' a fortune off this stuff .
DR. VASS: If you get caught , do n't tell them you got AIDS . They 'll never let you back in . You 've got thirty days to get your ass ack down here and pay me the other half , after that I send MIGUEL .
BORDER AGENT: Anything to declare .
RON: Nada .
RICHARD BARKLEY: I 'm Richard Barkley from the Food and Drug Administration office . Ron nods . A beat .
RON: Well as I told the gentlemen , I am a sick man . I have cancer . I take 22 pills a day and these here vials of Vitamin A , C , E and Zinc . That there is ninety days .
RICHARD BARKLEY: Vitamins ? You do realize that importing unapproved drugs for sale is a very serious offense ?
RON: Well , as I said , they 're not fo sale . And they ai n't illegal , just `` unapproved . '' A long beat ; they stare at each other .
RICHARD BARKLEY: If we find the slightest indication that you 're selling these drugs for profit , you will be thrown in jail Father .
RON: Then I promise to take each and every one of them pills myself . In fact this present detainment has already put me off schedule Son .
NURSE FRAZIN: She 's not here today .
EVE: It 's open ! Ron comes in .
RON: Dead ? Sorry for bargin ' in .
EVE: What are you doing here ? You look great .
RON: Actually I look amazin ' . But you , you look like shit .
EVE: What happened to you ?
RON: So you got any music ? Or crackers ?
EVE: I 'm sorry , but what is this ?
RON: It 's a celebration of how absolutely fuckin ' wrong you were . Ron holds up a bottle of sparkling wine .
EVE: Excuse me ?
RON: Thirty days you said ! Well here it is months later and I 'm goin ' like gangbusters . Now if that do n't call fo a little Cheez Whiz on a Ritz , I do n't know what does ! Ron heads for the refrigerator .
EVE: No . Do n't I do n't really eat here .
RAYON: Them bastards Kentucky fried me .
RON: You women love Nancy Boys .
EVE: Tell me what 's wrong .
RON: Hell , I 'll tell you what 's wrong , it 's the goddamn AZT !
EVE: What ?
RON: It 's killin ' him , ca n't you see that ? Why you think I look so healthy ?
EVE: What the hell do you think you 're doing ? !
RON: Helpin ' him , that 's what .
EVE: He 's a participant in a clinical trial , we need to get him to the hospital !
RON: So they can fuck him up even worse ?
EVE: Are you out of your mind ? ! If anything happens to him
RON: Relax , it 's just a little vitamin boost , A , C , zinc .
EVE: It 's a blind study ! We do n't even know if he 's getting AZT !
RAYON: Everyone knows what they 're gettin ' . AZT tastes differently . I guess I got lucky and got the real thing .
RON: Yeah , real lucky . I 've got stuff here that works . Healthy , non-toxic . You should trial it and we 'll oth get rich .
EVE: Leave , please ! Ron turns to Rayon .
RON: Tell your friends about me . Send ` em my way and I 'll hook ` em up . Ron heads for the door .
EVE: This man also had a transfusion ?
NURSE FRAZIN: The AZT . We can tell who 's on it by the symptoms . Most of them need new blood .
EVE: He 's actually getting worse .
NURSE FRAZIN: So why are they stopping the trial ?
EVE: What do you mean ?
NURSE FRAZIN: Barrow Wilkem , did n't you see the memo ? They claim most people are feeling bette and fewer people are dying .
EVE: Really ?
DR. SEVARD: It 's Barrow Wilkem 's call , Eve . So we can get the drug to the people who need it .
EVE: After six months ?
DR. SEVARD: Their trial results are overwhelmingly positive . AZT is working .
EVE: But we have no idea what the long term effects are . It 's irresponsible .
DR. SEVARD: These people die , Eve . There are no long-term effects .
EVE: Can I see a copy of the study ?
DR. SEVARD: It 's still being written . Here .
EVE: A press release from the NIH ?
RON: Jesus Mother Mary Fuckin ' Christ ! She 's not a woman , it 's

DAVID WAYNE: You son of a bitch !
RON: Bitches . Plural . There 's a bunch of faggots runnin ' a hell of a club up in New York . That 's where I got the idea . Welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club .

RAYON: Hi .
RON: This is Rayon . He said hi to you .
DENISE: Beaumont Lab 's delivery is here . A woman says you were expecting her .
FRANCINE SUSKIND: You can get it abroad but in the States , we can only use it for animal research . It 's not classified as a drug so the FDA does not control it .
RON: I 'm usin ' it for memory loss . You oughta try gettin ' it to market .
FRANCINE SUSKIND: It costs around 250 million dollars to get a drug to market .
RON: Damn , bureaucracy is good business .
FRANCINE SUSKIND: These are for your animal research .
RON: And these are for your daughter .
RAYON: You 're all packed , here 's your ticket .

MR. YAMATA: Regarding your order . I am so sorry , but we are no longer allowed to export interferon to the United States .
RON: What do you mean ?
MR. YAMATA: I am sorry . I know you 've come a long way .
RON: Fourteen hours on a plane , but hey , who gives a shit , right ?
MR. YAMATA: Please understand . Japanese doctors will be the only ones who can make the purchase . And as Ron 's wheels turn
DR. HIROSHI: that is correct . Two thousand vials of alpha interferon .
RON: Yeah , I 'm coming . Prepare the sedation . Propofol . 10 milligrams .

TUCKER: Woodroof ?
RON: That a party out there ?
DR. SEVARD: Mr. Woodroof .
RON: Doc-tor Sevard ! You must be surprised to see me .
DR. SEVARD: You nearly killed yourself . We need to know where you acquired those drugs .
RON: And I need to know what you 're pumpin ' into me here .
DR. SEVARD: A combination of AZT
RON: What ? Get it out ! Ron rips the I.V . out of his arm .
DR. SEVARD: Your stuff gave you a heart attack .
RON: Go to hell . I say what goes in my body , not you . Final . Period . End of story .
DR. SEVARD: That decision , like it or not , is left up to the people in this hospital .
RON: This thing 's an epidemic and you 're still lookin for guinea pigs . Well do I look like a rodent to you ?
RICHARD BARKLEY: Mr. Woodroof , we tolerate the Buyers Clubs . Now , every other organization in the country is dancing with us but fo some reason , either you do n't understand what we 're saying or you just do n't give a shit .
DR. SEVARD: You 're a fool if you think you 're helping yourself .
RON: That 's right . I fooled you . You told me I 'd be dead in thirty days .
RON: Now I 'm through with you . You got anything to say , tell it to my real doctor , Dr. Saks .
RAYON: I was so worried
RON: Where 's my suitcase ?
SEVARD: Mr. Woodroof , would you please get back in bed ?
RON: Nope . And if you 're gon na call an orderly on me , you 'd better fuckin ' do it , cuz this motherfucker is going home .
DR. SEVARD: You 're his physician and you ca n't tell me what medications he 's on ?
EVE: He came in once for advice . I have no idea what he does outside of this hospital .
DR. SEVARD: Well the FDA confiscated over two thousand vials of alpha interferon that he was about to sell to AIDS patients . Our patients !
EVE: Actually , I 've been reading about Buyers Clubs . They say they found other drugs that are eliminating symptoms .
DR. SEVARD: Without controlled trials , we 'll never be able to cure this thing because we 'll have no legitimate data . Tell you patients to stay away from him . With that , Sevard exits . On Eve .
RAYON: This guy says the Florida Buyers Club is cheaper .
RON: Then tell him to move to the fuckin ' sunshine state !
EVE: Ron , I respect that you 're learning about your illness but some of these people should be in the hospital .
RON: All the hospital wants is to serve up
EVE: AZT helps eradicate the virus .
RON: Fuck the virus , once you got that , you 're married to it . I 'm more concerned about my symptoms and survival . I mean , I 'm no scientist but
RAYON: You 're not ? 'Cause you sound so scientific . Rayon and Sunny laugh like children .
RON: You fuckin ' high again ?
RAYON: I dunno .
RON: Are you listenin ' to what I 'm sayin ' here about usin ' that shit ? And what the fuck did you do to my wall ? !
RAYON: It 's cranberry mocha . For the holidays .
RON: People can live with this thing fo longer than they 're saying . Ninety-six- percent of people diagnosed with AIDS in the U S of A will be dead in under six months .
EVE: I know the statistics .
RON: Then use them . Why give people AZT when their immune system is broken ? It 's fuckin ' toxic !
EVE: If you 're abusing it , like you did , with no medical surveillance , of course it is .
RON: Maybe I did abuse it , but I 'm off it now , and I 'm here , feeling good . And I 'm not the only one .
RAYON: It 's Marc Bolan , silly ! Why do n't you just get it over with and say it , you love it !
RON: Take your sunflower and get out .
RAYON: Fine !
RON: You know what , look at it , do n't look at it , I do n't give a shit .
DR. SEVARD: Where the hell are my trial patients ? Nurse Frazin ignores him and walks away .
RON: Do n't touch !
RAYON: If I really thought you were interested , I 'd tell you .
RON: What are you doin ' here ?
DAVID WAYNE: You 're being audited . The IRS .
RON: Nice work , fellas , great . This is how you got Al Capone , ai n't it ? As the Agents exit
DAVID WAYNE: Do n't piss them off . If there 's a fine , we 'll pay it .
RON: A fine ? Fine , alright , how much ? Ten thousand ? Twenty thousand ? I 'll write you a check right now . Ron grabs his check book .
RAYON: Honey , you do n't have a snowball 's chance wearing that thing .
RON: Rayon , I do n't need help gettin ' ladies from your sorry ass .
RAYON: Trailer trash and rodeo groupies do not count as ladies . Are you sure she said the word yes ? Fuck off !
RON: It 's the Wildflowers . Texas style .
EVE: They 're beautiful . Thank you . And I do n't even have to water them . Ron slides in across from her .
RON: Thanks for coming .
EVE: You do n't actually believe I would do that ?
RON: Nah . But you gon na have to watch what you say when you 're around that snake you work with . He 's the virus I 'm worried about . As a matter fact , if you hear of anything
EVE: I do n't dance .
RON: That 's cause you do n't got a honey . How old are you anyway ? Twenty two ?
EVE: Why are we here ?
RON: To eat , drink , enjoy life , be merry
EVE: Yeah right .
RON: Take a break , relax , breathe , Saks .
EVE: Because I was good in science . And my father said studying history was a waste of time . So I went to med school .
RON: Not what I thought you 'd say but makes sense , your dad was a practical man .
EVE: Yes , he was . Your turn . Why did you ecome an electrician , right ?
RON: Well my old man was an electrician . A good one too . But he was a bette drinker . Which I learned from him as well .
EVE: What about your mom ?
RON: She was a painter , kind of a gypsy . She got tired a ' all the shit and left . You know how it is .
EVE: She painted that , your mom ?
RON: Do n't feel like you got ta hang it . I know you like everything perfect .
EVE: I do not . I 'll hang it . I 'm going to hang it . It 's just are you sure you do n't want to keep it ? Ron looks at her . A long time , then
RON: You need to enjoy your life , little lady . You only got one .
RAYON: Sit down and shut up . Ron 's POV on the TV .
NEWS ANCHOR: New studies have proven that AZT is effective in stopping the progression of AIDS in asymptomatic cases . Dr. Anthony Fauci , head of the National Institute of Health , announced that a trial had clearly shown that early AZT intervention will keep AIDS at bay . AZT is the only drug that has been shown in scientifically controlled trials to be safe and effective , Fauci contended .
EVE: I want all my HIV patients on the asymptomatic study to have their AZT doses lowered to the minimum , 600 milligrams .
RON: That 's four pills , three times a day with food . The vitamins too .
TUCKER: Sorry , Ron . Gentlemen , I 'm gon na need you all to leave the premises in an orderly fashion , please !
RICHARD BARKLEY: Mr. Woodroof , I have a court orde permitting us to confiscate any and all non-FDA approved drugs or supplements .
RON: In other words , my entire inventory .
RICHARD BARKLEY: It 's improperly labeled . That 's a violation of FDA regulations .
RON: It 's a bullshit technicality and you know it ! Get my lawyer on the phone . Rayon crosses off to make the call .
RICHARD BARKLEY: Our primary concern is preventing a market for illegal drugs .
RON: Illegal ? Unapproved ! These are vitamins and minerals , for Chrissake !
RICHARD BARKLEY: Vitamins and minerals that gave you a heart attack , remember ?
RON: I 'm not selling that stuff , you confiscated it , remember ?

EVE: I 'm not doing a study for people who are asymptomatic with a toxic drug that makes them sick . We do n't treat people who have antibodies for pneumonia or chicken pox when they 're healthy . Why should HIV e any different ?
DR. SEVARD: It 's a different kind of virus .
EVE: Says who ? Barrow Wilkem ? !
FRANK YOUNG: Americans with life-threatening illnesses will be permitted to import small quantities of unapproved drugs fo their personal use . Under this arrangement , the drugs may only be purchased by individuals who have been prescribed the medication by a physician .
RAYON: What the fuck does that mean ?
RON: It means we were unapproved . Now we 're illegal !
RAYON: Save your money , we 're broke . Our credit cards are maxed .
RAYON: How bout that size ? Those would look good on me .
RON: You ai n't gettin ' tits , Rayon . Memberships are high and so is demand . So we recruit more members from where ?
RAYON: Support groups .
RON: Yep ! I 'm got ta find MDs to write them prescriptions so we can keep dealin ' these drugs legally now .
RAYON: In the meantime we could try the bank ?
RON: Oh yeah , Bonnie and Clyde comin ' in for a loan . Stop starin ' at her tits , you 're startin ' to look normal .
IAN: Mr. Woodroof
RON: Do n't try to con me
IAN: We do n't want money .
RON: What do you want ?
IAN: The house is free . We want to help .
RON: Oh . Well that 's good news . Ian sticks his hand out , Ron shakes it .
RAYON: Guess I did n't make the cut .
THE MAN: You made that choice yourself .
RAYON: It was n't a choice , Dad . Rayon 's father looks at him with disdain .
RAYON'S FATHER: What do you want , Raymond ?
RAYON: I 'm fine , thanks . And you ? Long time no see .
RAYON'S FATHER: I suppose I should thank you for wearing men 's clothes and not embarrassing me .

RAYON: He is helpin ' you . I got AIDS .
RON: What ? No , please , wait a minute , doc
RAYON: Maybe this will help .
RON: Where 'd you get that ? Rayon exits the room proudly .
RAYON: I sold my life insurance policy .
EVE: What are you doing ?
RON: Goin ' to Mexico , chica , you comin ' ?
EVE: Do I look like someone who takes vacations ?
RON: Come on , tequila , sunshine , tacos , neve hurt anybody . Eve enjoys the attention . Shakes her head .
EVE: I know and I ca n't either . I 'm sorry . We ca n't write scripts for random people and random drugs . Plus what if something goes wrong with these drugs ? We could get sued , lose our license .
RON: Okay ! Never hurts to ask . Eve takes the hat off and hands it to Ron .
SUNNY: You need to go to the hospital . Rayon ca n't respond .
RAYON: Okay , okay . I 'll go . Put me down . Let me get some things first . Rayon picks up his bag .
DR. VASS: Secretions that the caterpillar uses to protect itself during the incubation period
RON: Does n't surprise me at all . Vass hands Ron some more paperwork .
DR. VASS: These are early trial results fo Fluconazole .
RON: The anti-fungal , right ? I read about this .
DR. VASS: You want to take some home ?
RON: As much I can carry .
DR. VASS: We need a thousand more like you .
RON: Hell Vass , I 'm just tryin ' to run a usiness .
NURSE FRAZIN: I took him off of it as you instructed . He 's just on morphine now .
EVE: Good . I 'll be in my office . Thanks fo calling .
RON: Yes sir .
DENISE: Those are the emergencies .
RON: Where 's Rayon ?
DENISE: At the hospital .
RON: Sevaaaaard !
NURSE FRAZIN: I need security up here , right away .
RON: Sevard ! Ron spots Sevard .
DR. SEVARD: What are you talking about ?
RON: You call yourself a doctor ? You are a murderer .
DR. SEVARD: Leave or you will be arrested .
RON: Arrest me ? Did you hear that ? Two SECURITY GUARDS enter .
DENISE: From Austin . All on AZT . Thei insurance is paying for the treatment and they do n't know if they can afford to switch .
RON: Hook ` em up .
DENISE: We 're pretty cash poor .
RON: Sell my car and make sure everyone gets what they need .
EVE: Rayon was a drug addict ! It was n't a day on AZT that killed him , but the disease as a whole ! Ron registers . Calms down a bit .
RON: and got carried out in a trash bag three days later !
EVE: He was my friend too , you know !
RON: Let me ask you something . Let 's say I have the cure right here in my back pocket . I could save everyone today . Eve 's expression changes .
DAVID WAYNE: They shut her lab down . The FDA has shut all of our suppliers down , what can I tell you ?
RON: If I do n't get it by the end of the week I wan na file a lawsuit .
DAVID WAYNE: Come on , Ron , we lost the restraining order , remember ? We 're in Texas . The court system is the last resort for you .
RON: Well find a place where it 's not , Goddamnit . Go to San Francisco , get a sissy judge , figure it out !
EVE: What 's going on ?
DR. SEVARD: Barrow Wilkem gave us the green light on the AZT pediatric trials .
EVE: What ? This is crazy ! All these kids are HIV positive ? Sevard looks uneasy .
DR. SEVARD: We 're starting very slowly with a fifth of a dose .
EVE: Would you give this fifth of a dose to your own child ?
RON: Here you go , please read this .
RICHARD BARKLEY: And what is going on ?
RON: Why was Peptide T cut off ? A non-toxic drug , that I have proof works and that according to the National Institute of Mental Health , is completely safe .
RICHARD BARKLEY: Mr. Woodroof , you are nothing but a common drug dealer
RON: I 'm a drug dealer ? You 're the drug dealer . The pharmaceutical companies are the drug dealers .
DR. SEVARD: We think it is in everyone 's best interest that you resign .
EVE: I wo n't . You 'll have to fire me . She starts to leave , stops , turns around .
RON: One left .
EVE: We 're splitting that . Ron cracks the beer and hands her the can .
RON: That was a ballsy move ! Eve looks away . Ron opens his arms
EVE: Regular ? What 's that ? Does n't exist .
RON: Yeah , I guess . I just want Ron looks at her .
EVE: What ? He takes the can back .
RON: an ice-cold beer at Ruby 's . Go dancin ' with my woman . I want kids thumb wrestle with my sons . I do n't know . I got one life mine . But I want someone else 's . I feel I 'm fighting for a life I ai n't got the time to live . Ron downs some beer .
EVE: It does .
TUCKER: I 'll take care of this .
TUCKER'S FATHER: Of course I remember you , trouble maker .
RON: I still am ! They share a smile .
TUCKER: I 'm gon na talk with Ron a minute , pop . Tucker steps off to the side with Ron .
RON: Thanks for the tip , Tuck . And as Ron exits the house
TUCKER: I 'll be there , man , and do n't you fuckin ' hit me again !
EVE: This is Fluconazole . It helps them with Thrush .
RICHARD BARKLEY: No one move . Put your hands in the air . The news camera keeps rolling .
TUCKER: Ronald Woodroof ? Ron steps up through the crowd .
RICHARD BARKLEY: Turn off that camera . Now ! But the Camera Man does n't stop filming .
RON: I ai n't no cop . Why'nt you tell 'em ? Tucker escorts Ron outside .
DAVID WAYNE: They wrote the FDA 's story .
RON: I ca n't believe it . I tipped those assholes off .
DAVID WAYNE: Do n't worry . I got good news . I got you a change of venue for the Peptide T trial in San Francisco . And no surprise , they 're not pressing charges .
RON: They 'll never break me .
JUDGE: The constitution , specifically the ninth amendment , does not state that you have the right to be mentally healthy o physically healthy . It does state that you have a right to chose your own medical care but that is interpreted as medical care that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration . The Judge looks over to the FDA table .
RON: Jesus Mother Mary Fucking Christ !
REVIE: I 'm just going to make a brief statement . CAPTION `` JULY 4th , 1974 ''
CLOUGH: `` And let me play among the stars.. ''
SIMON: When are we there ?
CLOUGH: Any moment now . On the right . `` Let me see what spring is like ''
BOY 1: There it is ! Dad ! There it is ! The BOYS smile in excitement .
CLOUGH: `` ..on Jupiter and Mars.. ''
BOY 1: Where are you going ? Dad ? You 've missed it .
CLOUGH: We 've something else to do first . Wo n't take long .
MITCHELL: Today we welcome Brian Clough as he starts his new job as manager of Leeds United , taking over from Don Revie - the most successful manager in the club 's history , under whom Leeds have won everything..
CLOUGH: ..not QUITE everything . Not won the European Cup
MITCHELL: but pretty much everything else . Daunted ?
CLOUGH: Daunted ? Not at all , Austin . Looking forward to it .
MITCHELL: The biggest challenge of your life , and you 'll be without Peter Taylor , for the first time . Your lifelong professional colleague .
CLOUGH: Yes , Pete 's at Brighton now . He had the opportunity to come with me , but Brighton was his choice . Leeds was mine .
MITCHELL: A surprising choice , some might say . Because you 've been very vocal in you criticism of them over the years .
CLOUGH: I have .
MITCHELL: You 've accused players of dirty tactics , cheating , dissent , foul play . You called Norman Hunter , Norman `` Bites yer legs '' Hunter , you 've said Peter Lorimer falls when no one touches him
CLOUGH: And I was right .
MITCHELL: I 'm curious . Why do you now show such alacrity to joining them after such vituperative criticism of them for so long ?
CLOUGH: Goodness , it 's going to take me half an hour to explain all those words fo a start . Laughter from the camera CREW.. CLOUGH Football is a beautiful game , Austin . It needs to be played beautifully . I think Leeds have sold themselves short
MITCHELL: `` That type of operation ? '' I presume you 're referring to Don Revie..
CLOUGH: I am..
MITCHELL: ..who has long been regarded as a father figure in Leeds . And now you 're coming in as the outsider , the enemy even , after all the things you 've said in public , coming in and taking ouve as STEPfather .
CLOUGH: I would accept and expect a strangeness , initially , it 's perfectly normal . But it wo n't be long before they realise I 'm a fair man . A kind man . And maybe under me they can experience what it 's like to be in a happy family , after all .
MITCHELL: How can you be sure they were n't happy with Don all along ?
CLOUGH: They would n't have played football that way if they were happy .
JIMMY GORDON: Where have you been , boss ?
JIMMY: Directors have been waiting more than an hour . C'mon..
CLOUGH: Morning lads ! Lovely Yorkshire weather ! I tell you makes me want to jump on a plane right back to Majorca !
JIMMY: You 're five days late ! ! And did you eally need to say that about Majorca ? You know he was Revie 's first choice for getting your job .
CLOUGH: Who ? Johnny Giles ?
JIMMY: Club Captain . Don 's son and heir . His first born . You 're never going to get any love from him .
CLOUGH: Great . Here 's to happy fucking families .
CLOUGH: Any chance of a cup of tea , duck ?
JEAN: They 're waiting for you . Upstairs . CLOUGH swings his feet on the desk .
CLOUGH: Who 's that ?
JEAN: The Directors .
CLOUGH: For me ? Why ?
JEAN: For the board meeting .
CLOUGH: Let them wait . Now , how about that cup of tea ?
JEAN: Yours , Mr. Clough .
CLOUGH: Not mine . I did n't put it there , did
JEAN: Mr. Revie 's .
CLOUGH: Let 's get rid of it then , shall we ? Chairs , too . The whole bloody lot . Think it would be best if there were nothing of his left here . CLOUGH reaches the door.. CLOUGH Were you his secretary ?
JEAN: I was . For thirteen happy years .
CLOUGH: What 's your name , pet ?
JEAN: Jean , Sir . Jean Reid .
CLOUGH: In which case , no offence duck , but there 's nothing I want typed on pape from you other than your resignation . She gasps.. CLOUGH And you can change the locks on you way out . Do n't want the ghost of troubled Don popping in now , do we ? Rattling his chains . Scaring my young ones .
CUSSINS: Come in , Brian .
CLOUGH: What ? No one going to offer me a drink ? Like an undertakers in here . The DIRECTORS shoot looks at one another .
CUSSINS: Why did you do it ?
CLOUGH: Do what ?
BOLTON: The interview . For Yorkshire TV .
CUSSIN: We 've had a phone-call .
BOLTON: Not so much a phone-call . Bloody tirade .
CUSSINS: From Don . They only went and rung him . And ran some of your quotes by him . About how unhappy the players were . What `` bad champions '' . Looking for a esponse .
BOLTON: Bloody got one , as well . He 's gone erserk .
CLOUGH: He had it coming . He should n't have done that piece in the Mirror should he ? Saying he thought I was a daft choice .
BOLTON: He 's entitled to his opinions .
CLOUGH: And I 'm entitled to mine .
CUSSINS: And I 'm entitled to MINE .
CLOUGH: Thank you . I 'm the best old one , too .
CUSSINS: I also did it under the assumption that you 'd be coming here wanting the est for the club . For the city of Leeds . So why do I still get the feeling this is all about you and Don ?
CLOUGH: Of course it 's just about me and Don . Always has been . But instead of putting frowns on your foreheads , o ye elders of Leeds , in your blazers and ass fucking buttons , it should put ig white Colgate smiles on your big white faces , because it means I wo n't sleep and wo n't eat until I take whatever that man 's achieved and eaten it beaten it so I never have to hear the name `` Don Fucking Revie '' again beat it so the only name anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale houses , raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths , is Brian Clough . Brian Clough uber fucking alles . Understand ?
RADIO ANNOUNCER: ..Ladies and Gentlemen , the draw fo the third round of the FA Cup will now commence..
CLOUGH: C'mon , Pete !
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Derby County , second division..
CLOUGH: Here we go . That 's us.. !
RADIO COMMENTATOR: Against mighty Leeds United.. ! CLOUGH and TAYLOR cry out in shock..
CLOUGH: Leeds.. !
TAYLOR: Fucking hell.. !
CLOUGH: Don Revie 's Leeds ! Top of Division One ! Here we bloody come !
SAM LONGSON: What do you say to that , Mr. Chairman ?
UNCLE SAM: I can hear the cash registers now !
CLOUGH: Happy days , Sir . Happy days .
UNCLE SAM: You 're not wrong , Brian . Take the family out for a meal . Go to The Mumtaz . Tell ` em I 'm paying .
CLOUGH: Put the fish and chips in the bin . Tonight 's on Uncle Sam . We 're going posh . Chicken fucking bhuna in town .
CLOUGH: Spick and span , understand ? Wash these walls down . Give the floors a prope polish .
GROUNDSMAN: Well , you ca n't fucking train on it then .
CLOUGH: You know he 'll be making a file on us . A dossier .
TAYLOR: Who ?
CLOUGH: Don Revie . Prepares a file on every game . Leaves nothing to chance . Knows every opponents formations . Strategies . Everything .
TAYLOR: I 've heard he 's a superstitious twat . Ey.. ! Help him , someone HELP him.. !
CLOUGH: We grew up just a few streets apart , you know . In Middlesborough , close to Ayrsome Park . He 'll have known my street , Valley Road - probably bought sweets from Garnetts Factory , where my dad worked .
TAYLOR: Heard he wears the same suit to every game . His `` lucky blue suit '' .
CLOUGH: The best manager in the country , Don Revie . Played for Sunderland , like me , as a centre-forward , like me , and England , like me .
TAYLOR: C'mon , give it and go !
CLOUGH: Peas in a pod , me and Don . Two peas in a fucking pod .
JIMMY: They 're here ! Well , almost..
CLOUGH: What are they doing ?
JIMMY: They 've run out of petrol .
TAYLOR: No , it 's that superstition , is n't it ? Every away cup ties , Revie makes them walk the last hundred yards .
CLOUGH: Welcome to Derby , Don . Pleasure to meet you . I 'm Brian Clough .
TAYLOR: Referee.. !
JIMMY: Think , Alan ! To feet !
TAYLOR: Now sent it out wide !
CLOUGH: What ? He did n't fucking touch him ! Ref ! He DIVED ! He fucking dived !
CLOUGH: Did n't say good-bye . Or pay me the espect of staying for a drink . Could n't wait to get away .
TAYLOR: Bloody cheats and all . Neither of those goals should have been allowed . But CLOUGH does n't hear
CLOUGH: Just going to have to beat them , Pete . Beat him it 's the last thing I do .
TAYLOR: We need to get into the same division first .
CLOUGH: We need someone with a good head . Experience .
TAYLOR: I know . Our lot were like headless chickens out there today . CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR
CLOUGH: First thing Monday morning , I want you to go and find me that player . A wise head . TAYLOR opens his mouth , is about to protest.. CLOUGH And do n't worry about the money . That 's my problem . Just you go and find him .
GILES: I do n't know what you 're talking about . CLOUGH turns to NORMAN HUNTER
CLOUGH: But you do , though , `` Bites yer Legs '' .
HUNTER: People kick me , I kick them back .
CLOUGH: Not with me as manager . Do that on my watch , you 'll be fined and stuck in the reserves . Things are going to be a little different around here . Without Don . Might feel a little strange at first . Might pinch a little . Like a new pai of shoes . But if you want you grandchildren to remember you fo eing something other than the dirty uggers you all were , if you want to e loved as REAL champions , WORTHY champions , you 're going to have to work . And improve . And change . Now let 's start off by playing some seven-a-sides .
BREMNER: Don never did that .
CLOUGH: Well , I 'm not Don . And from now on I never want to hear that man 's name again . Ever . Next player who mentions it , or what he did or did n't bloody do in the good ol ' days , will spend a week cleaning my boots . Seven-a-side . Keep it nice and clean , and sensible . No fifty-fifty 's . CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short.. CLOUGH Right , I 'll play myself . You might learn something , Irishman . Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts .
JIMMY: Fucking matter with you ? He said no fifty-fifty 's .
HUNTER: What are you going to do about it ? Book me ?
BREMNER: `` Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts . ''
JIMMY: I 've got what you were looking for .
CLOUGH: What about the petrol ?
JIMMY: In the boot of the car .
CLOUGH: Good lad .
CUSSINS: Everything all right ?
CLOUGH: Fine thank you , Mr. Cussins .
BARBARA: Not now , love - please ?
CLOUGH: But it might be Pete .
BARBARA: Of course it 's Pete . `` Rrrriiinnngggg '' , CLOUGH tries to eat , then..
CLOUGH: But it might be important . C'mon , eat your carrots . For you Mother . CLOUGH gets up . Walks out of the room..
TAYLOR: You asked me to find a player with a good head . Experience . I 've found one ! He 's perfect . Dave Mackay .
CLOUGH: Dave Mackay ? ! ? He 's a hundred and fucking fifty .
TAYLOR: I admit he 's not young .
CLOUGH: Not young ? He 's old as fucking time !
TAYLOR: But he 's clever , keeps the ball well . And passes it better than anyone alive .
CLOUGH: You sure ?
TAYLOR: Never been more sure of anything in my life .
CLOUGH: All right , I 'll talk to Longson in the morning .
TAYLOR: We have n't got until morning . Hearts have already made him an offer . Want him as their manager . Apparently they 've already agreed terms .
CLOUGH: Well , what did you fucking call me fo then ?
TAYLOR: Because when I asked Bill Nick how done the deal was - he said ninety- nine per cent . CLOUGH 's face .
CLOUGH: Meaning he has n't signed .
TAYLOR: Exactly .
BARBARA: All right , Brian . Enough . Come back now..
CLOUGH: Where would we play him ?
TAYLOR: In the middle of the park . Somewhere he can see everything , use his loaf , and tell the kids what to do .
CLOUGH: We 'll play him as a sweeper , then .
TAYLOR: Aye . They climb into the waiting car
CLOUGH: Wo n't have to run about too much . And what 's all this I hear about a tie shop ?
TAYLOR: He 's got a tie shop , has n't he ? In London . Which he spends two days a week at . CLOUGH starts the engine
CLOUGH: Fucking tie shop ?
TAYLOR: It 's his `` nest egg '' . For the future .
CLOUGH: No one 's going to be wearing fucking ties in twenty years time .
TAYLOR: Is it ? Then perhaps we should just shake on it today ? And sign tomorrow ?
CLOUGH: What ? And let Hearts in again in the morning ? Fuck off . I 'm not leaving here without a signature . CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk up the garden path.. CLOUGH You 'd bloody DO that , too - would n't you ? Come all this way , then just `` shake hands '' ? Dear oh dear . What would you DO without me ?
TAYLOR: Hey , you would never have FOUND him if it were n't for me .
CLOUGH: Good job we 're both wearing ties .
MACKAY: Who the bloody hell are you ?
CLOUGH: My name 's Brian Clough , and I once had the pleasure of playing for England against you in an Under-23 match .
MACKAY: I remember you now . You had a black eye , a right bloody shiner . And never stopped fucking talking ! What are you doing here ?
CLOUGH: Come to talk to you about the Promised Land , Dave . Land of Milk and Honey . It 's a little place up the M1 called Derby . May we come in ?
UNCLE SAM: Dave Mackay ? ?
CLOUGH: You do n't look happy , Uncle Sam .
UNCLE SAM: I 'm not . What were you thinking ? Going over my head like that ? Why did n't you call ?
CLOUGH: Because you 'd have said ` no ' .
UNCLE SAM: Bloody right I 'd have said ` no ' . The man 's bloody crocked .
CLOUGH: Pete reckons he 's good for three more years .
UNCLE SAM: Is he fuck . He 's broken more bones than Evel Knievel .
CLOUGH: Trust me , Mr. Chairman . It 's money well spent . LONGSON turns and double-takes .
UNCLE SAM: And who the FUCK are they ?
CLOUGH: That 'd be Messrs. McGovern and O'Hare .
UNCLE SAM: Where did they come from ?
CLOUGH: My old stomping grounds . Hartlepools and Sunderland . Very reasonable , too . CLOUGH smiles.. CLOUGH Just doing what 's best for the club .
UNCLE SAM: That 'd be MY club , Brian . MY club .
CLOUGH: You 're a genius , Pete . Bloody genius . How did you see it ?
TAYLOR: Dunno . It was just obvious . McGovern in midfield , Mackay at the back , O'Hare up front . The skewer is n't it ? In the shish kebab .
CLOUGH: It 's beautiful . A thing of fucking eauty ! !
MACKAY: `` the man 's crocked '' , `` older than time '' `` broken more bones than Evel Knievel ? ''
LONGSON: All right , I admit it , I was wrong .
REVIE: ..for Leeds to win the First Division title , and for me to be named as English Manager of the yearfeels like a dream come true
CLOUGH: You enjoy it , Don . Go home , put you feet up and fucking enjoy it . There 's a good lad . Because we 'll be in the First Division next season . And we 're going to have you !
COMMENTATOR'S VOICE: The twin towers of Wembley Stadium , the cathedral of English football on a glorious late-summer 's day good afternoon everyone , it 's the Charity Shield , the opening Saturday of the 1974 season , and a first chance to get a look at Brian Clough 's Leeds
JOURNALIST: Will you be supporting Leeds today , Don ?
REVIE: You 'd expect nothing less having been their manager for 13 years . But the fact is I 'm here today as manager of England
JOURNALIST: Do you have any advice to give you successor , Brian Clough , before his first game ?
REVIE: Win . The people of Leeds are used to winning .
CLOUGH: Right , the team for today is Harvey in goal , Reaney , Cherry , Bremner , McQueen , Hunter , Lorimer , Clarke , Jordan , Giles , Gray .
CLOUGH: Of course , it goes without saying I 'd like you to continue as Club Captain . Silence . BREMNER continues to limber up CLOUGH You know , son , I 've nothing but the highest regard for you as a player .
BREMNER: Never got it . They walk out into the ROAR of the crowd .
COMMENTATOR: Kevin Keegan goes to ground.rolling around on the pitch.that almost looked like Johnny Giles 's fist made contact with Kevin Keegan 's faceit was ! the referee 's pulled out his ooknow a fight has broken out !
CLOUGH: For fuck 's sake..
BREMNER: Not fucking English .
CLOUGH: There I am making a big song and dance to the media about our new approach . Our new attitude . Our new ethics . And you turn the place into fucking Verdun . My CAPTAIN . Silence . CLOUGH shakes himself dry . CLOUGH What am I going to do if they suspend you ? You 're my best player . I tell you , I 've a mind to fine you two weeks wages !
BREMNER: You ca n't do that ! Mr. Revie always paid all our fines .
CLOUGH: Well he 's not fucking here now , is he ?
BREMNER: No , he 's not .
CLOUGH: Right , last time there was a whole division between you and Leeds . Not now . Not today . Today we 're here as Second Division champions , and equals with Leeds . John McGovern and Billy Bremner , EQUALS . Kevin Hector and Johnny Giles , EQUALS . Alan Hinton and Peter Lorimer , John O'Hare and Paul Madely . EQUALS . Now , c'mon , chins up . Chests out . We can take this fucking lot .
TAYLOR: Arrogant twat..
CLOUGH: But he 's right . Five nothing . They made us look like fools today . And what was John O'Hare doing ? Letting Madeley bully him like that .
TAYLOR: Yours .
CLOUGH: He was all over the place . Like the Wandering Jew . Giving the ball to anyone BUT his own . We need a ball player , a natural in midfield . Who 'll hold onto it . Keep possession . We 're giving it away too easily .
TAYLOR: Someone like Colin Todd .
CLOUGH: Oooh , now you 're talking . Lovely pai of feet .
TAYLOR: I 've heard he wants out of Sunderland , too . They 're all jumping ship up there . CLOUGH thinks for a moment , then
CLOUGH: Well , go on then . Sign him .
TAYLOR: What ? We ca n't . Longson 's already told us . Club 's in debt .
CLOUGH: Bollocks to that . I 've not brought us all the way to the First Division just to sit there mid-table , and be cannon fodder for sides like Leeds . Sign the man .
TAYLOR: Hang on , hang on , careful
CLOUGH: I 'll handle bloody Longson .
UNCLE SAM: A hundred and seventy grand ? ! ? Fo Colin fucking Todd ? ! ?
CLOUGH: Correction , the ALMIGHTY Colin Todd . The best technical footballer in the country .
UNCLE SAM: A salary of three hundred quid a week ? You ca n't pay a footballer that ! !
CLOUGH: That 's the way things are going , Uncle Sam . Football 's all about money now .
UNCLE SAM: I told you never to go over my head again .
CLOUGH: Had no choice . Windows opened up . You were in the bloody West Indies .
UNCLE SAM: WindowS ? You mean there were others ? ! ?
CLOUGH: Messrs. Gemmell and Hennessy . Two PLAYERS turn and wave to LONGSON..
UNCLE SAM: For fucks SAKE !
CLOUGH: Let me ask you a question , Uncle Sam . What did you come into football for ?
UNCLE SAM: To support the football club in MY HOME TOWN . The club I 've supported ALL
CLOUGH: Well , I 'm sure we all admire you loyalty
UNCLE SAM: What I DID N'T come into it for was to e lectured by a cocky little twat from the North East .
CLOUGH: But the way I see it , there 's no point eing in this game unless you want to eat the best , and be the best , and that 's all the people of Derby want . To see their team on top of the tree , Derby , Derby Uber Alles , and if it 's eally their interest you have at heart , not just impressing you friends in the Director 's box , I suggest you keep your eyes on you oad haulage business , keep you opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques , there 's a good lad . Leave the running of this football club to the professionals .
UNCLE SAM: But professionals DO N'T run the club , Brian , the Chairman does . And if it 's true , that football is all about money , and that 's the way it 's going , that 's suits us Chairmen just fucking fine..because we 're the ones who 've got it . SAM LONGSON lights a cigar , and walks off .
CLOUGH: See they 've driven all the way into the car park this time .
TAYLOR: It 's not a cup game , is it ?
CLOUGH: You know what your job is today ?
MCGOVERN: Yes , Boss . Stay in position . Keep the shape . `` Stop being the Wandering Jew '' .
CLOUGH: Good lad . And enjoy it . You deserve to . You 've worked hard this week . CLOUGH moves to JOHN O'HARE . CLOUGH Clear about what you 're doing today ?
O'HARE: Be big . Be strong . Any chance I get , flatten Paul fucking Madely .
CLOUGH: Good lad . He bullies you , you bully him back . And near post for the corners we worked on .
O'HARE: Yes , Boss .
CLOUGH: Understand what I want from you today , son ?
TODD: I should , Mr. Clough . It 's simple enough .
CLOUGH: Go on , let 's hear it .
TODD: `` To be Colin fucking Todd , the best technical footballer in the country . '' Laughter in the dressing-room .
CLOUGH: There , how could you forget that ? Now come on.. Up and at ` em !
MCGOVERN: No , Boss .
CLOUGH: Then why the fuck did you give it to their most dangerous player , Johnny fucking Giles ?
MCGOVERN: I did n't see him .
CLOUGH: You want me to get the sack , M O'Hare ?
O'HARE: No , Boss .
CLOUGH: That open goal ? Looked like a deliberate fucking miss to me . A miss to get your manager the sack .
TODD: No .
CLOUGH: No what ?
TODD: No , Boss .
CLOUGH: The amount of bloody money I paid fo you , I must have been out of my mind . You ca n't even keep on your feet .
TODD: No , Boss . CLOUGH turns , and faces the room .
CLOUGH: You 've all done a terrific job of getting me the sack . So I 'm not letting you out of here for the second half , until you 've finished the ottle .
TAYLOR: You ca n't do that ! ! CLOUGH winks
CLOUGH: Ca n't I ? Just you fucking watch me ! !
JIMMY: You all right ?
TAYLOR: Yeah.fine . TAYLOR indicates JIMMY 's cigarettes .
JIMMY: Where 's he gone now ?
CLOUGH: And.. ?
TAYLOR: 2-1 ! ! !
CLOUGH: Who scored ?
TAYLOR: O'Hare . A brace . Oh , Brian , you should have seen his first . Turns Bremne inside out , nutmegs Madeley for good measure . It was beautiful . You 'd think he 'd been born in Rio de Janeiro , not Aber-bloody-deen.. CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk off down the corridor . TAYLOR What made you go for the Brandy ?
CLOUGH: They were just nervous . Shitting themselves . You could tell .
TAYLOR: You 're a bloody genius . I tell you what , Bri - if we can beat this lot , we can go all the way .
CLOUGH: Derby County winning the championship is a victory for decency , for honesty and for football . Because they do n't pull shirts , or nudge people in the ack in the box .
REVIE: I have n't personally heard Mr. Clough 's comments , but they have been eported to me , and our solicitors are looking into them . If I could offe Mr. Clough some advice I think he 'd e better off keeping his opinions to himselfsome of these allegations against Leeds United and his fellow professionals are an absolute disgrace
CLOUGH: Don Revie ? Ooooh . Do n't mention that name to me .
DAVID FROST: It 's really like the other House of Commons . You hate to mention him . Why ?
CLOUGH: I hate to mention him why ? Because he 's a very talented man and I do n't like him . The audience laughs . CLOUGH He 's a very , very talented man and his ecord is unsurpassable . But I just happen not to like him . And I do n't like the way he goes about football either . Football is a game of opinion and there are perhaps people in you profession who do n't like the way you do your bit .
DAVID FROST: Sure .
CLOUGH: And er it makes the game go round . Half the country do n't like a Labou government . It just happens that the other half do .
JOHN SADLER: Brian , you 've been called big-headed , arrogant , brash , the lot -
CLOUGH: By your profession , John , yeah .
JOHN SALDER: Sure . And a whole of it right too .
CLOUGH: And a whole lot of it wrong .
JOHN SALDER: Fine . I 'll concede that . So how would you define your approach to management , apart from being illiant ? All laugh .
CLOUGH: Good lad . Thank you for the compliment . It 's very , very difficult when you get asked a question like that .
CLOUGH: Suprised , David..but more than surprised , delighted . It 's nice is n't it . For the good guys to win for once .
COLEMAN: Which for you was the most important match to win and the best performance from your point of view
CLOUGH: Beating Leeds United , obviously . Always a particular pleasure that .
COLEMAN: Brian , you 've also done it on comparatively small gates , which I know has niggled you a little bit during the season .
CLOUGH: Niggled me , David , it 's absolutely made me blazing . To be honest , I know what I want to achieve , I know what the people of Derby want us to achieve , but when you 've got a chairman not wanting to put his hand in his pocket
MOHAMMED ALI: ..the world knows who I am . The world knows I talk a lot .
TAYLOR: Are you going to stop it ?
CLOUGH: No , I want to fight him !
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: William Bremner , your conduct in the Charity Shield match was deplorable and can not be tolerated .
CLOUGH: It was .
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We understand Leeds are taking disciplinary action against you internally , however the Football Association has to be seen to make an example . We have therefore decided to impose a fine of five hundred pounds.. CLOUGH 's face a victorious look .
CLOUGH: Thank you..
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: and a suspension until Septembe 30th
CLOUGH: What ? September 30th ? That 's more than a month ? Thats six bloody weeks ? ?
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I 'll make it seven if you carry on with language like that..
CLOUGH: C'mon , double the fine . Treble it . Anything . Do n't suspend him for that long . He 's my Captain . The best playe I 've got .
CLOUGH: I suppose you 've heard !
TAYLOR: Godwhat time is it ?
CLOUGH: Suspended for eleven bloody games ! !
TAYLOR: I know . You 're buggered . Billy Bremner 's the heart and soul of that team .
CLOUGH: Plus Mike Jones and Eddie Gray are injured .
TAYLOR: Like I said . You 're buggered .
CLOUGH: What do I do , Pete ? I need new players . Tell me who to buy .
TAYLOR: No , Brian .
CLOUGH: Help me . C'mon , we 'll sort this place out together . You and me . Turn it around .
TAYLOR: It 's too late . I 'd have helped you once . But not now . Not after what was said . We 're on our own now . Each man for himself . Remember ?
MACKAY: Well , look who it is ! Come to raid my larder ? Or just missing the place ?
CLOUGH: McGovern and O'Hare . I 've spoken to them on the phone . They want to come and play for me .
MACKAY: Aye , and you can have ` em . A hundred and fifty thousand pound for the pair .
CLOUGH: Cheeky sod ! They 're not worth a penny more than seventy .
MACKAY: But you 're desperate now , are n't you ? Having lost to Stoke and Birmingham.. All , right , since it 's you..I 'll knock ten grand off .
CLOUGH: Give you a hundred grand .
MACKAY: One thirty . Final offer . CLOUGH is about to explode , then..
CLOUGH: All right . Done . The two MEN shake hands . Barely . CLOUGH So ? Enjoying yourself ?
MACKAY: Two wins from two . What 's not to enjoy ? You ?
CLOUGH: Loving it . Different class , Leeds . Proper club . BIG club .
MACKAY: Demand results there , though , Brian .
CLOUGH: Hey , it 's ` Boss ' to you .
MACKAY: Not any more .
CLOUGH: I bought you when you were crocked , you fat bastard . And gave you the two est years of your career . It will always be ` Boss ' to you .
MACKAY: Why would I do that ?
CLOUGH: Exorcise the bloody place . Get rid of me .
MACKAY: Why ? You 're not here anymore , are you ? Be a waste of a perfectly good desk .
CLOUGH: Fucking Scot .
JIMMY: McGovern and O'Hare ? Ca n't believe he actually sold them to you . It must be true , then..
CLOUGH: What ?
JIMMY: The rumour that he 's after buying Duncan Mackenzie . It 's why he needs the money .
CLOUGH: Who 's Duncan Mackenzie ? OVER THIS the sound of a ringing phone
MCGOVERN: Because of the way we play .
CLOUGH: Because of the way we play ! ! ! MACKENZIE lights a cigarette.. CLOUGH We 're going all the way , lads . Inte Milan , Barcelona . We 're going to win silverware Don Revie could only dream of .
MACKENZIE: Yes , Mr. Clough .
CLOUGH: Do you know how many goals I scored efore I got injured ?
MACKENZIE: I 'm sorry , Mr. Clough . I do n't .
CLOUGH: Two hundred and fifty-one .
MACKENZIE: I 'm sorry , Mr. Clough , I do n't .
CLOUGH: Have a guess . Go on
MACKENZIE: Three hundred ? MCGOVERN closes his eyes , `` Moron . ''
CLOUGH: Two hundred and seventy-four ! Now what do you think about that ?
MACKENZIE: Is that a record , Mr. Clough ?
CLOUGH: ` Course it 's a bloody record . CLOUGH shoots a look to the others.. CLOUGH You know what ELSE you lot can do that 's even more important ? You can be my eyes and ears in that dressing oom .
MACKENZIE: Yes , Mr. Clough .
CLOUGH: Want you to help me clear this place out . Make it MY team , understand . OUR team . Clean it up and clear it out once and for all .
MACKENZIE: Yes , Mr. Clough . CLOUGH indicates MACKENZIE 's drink..
CLOUGH: Now c'mon , drink up . We 're off to meet the press .
MACKENZIE: Yes , Mr. Clough . MACKENZIE knocks back his champagne..
CLOUGH: And Duncan.. ?
MACKENZIE: Yes , Mr. Clough ?
CLOUGH: It 's `` Boss '' from now on . There 's a good lad .
MACKENZIE: Yes , Mr. Clough .
BREMNER: What the hell did you buy them for ? Waste of bloody money .
CLOUGH: Duncan Mackenzie scored twenty-eight goals last season . John O'Hare and John McGovern are both internationals .
GILES: We 've got two strikers , Alan Clarke and Mick Jones , they 're internationals , too .
CLOUGH: And one 's injured and the other 's fucking suspended .
BREMNER: Maybe if you spent a little more time here on the training ground with us , you would n't need to buy Derby `` rejects '' . We 've a game Saturday . Against Queens Park Rangers . Or had you forgotten ?
CLOUGH: I have n't forgotten .
GILES: Well , you have n't told us a single thing about how QPR will play . M Revie would have files and dossiers prepared . Had the reserves playing the Rangers way all week . Had the first team looking out for this and that .
CLOUGH: Bollocks to Mr. Revie ! You 're professional footballers . Stop Stan Bowles ! That 's all you need to know about QPR . And I do n't have to justify myself to you . Not how or when I conduct training . Not who I buy o pick to play .
GILES: No . Not to us . But come Saturday afternoon , there 'll be 40,000 people here who you DO have to justify yourself , to .
CLOUGH: Sorry , lads .
REVIE: Who is this ?
CLOUGH: Watching it all fall apart . It 's Brian Clough .
REVIE: What ?
CLOUGH: They wo n't play for me . Your boys . Your bastard sons . And never will .
REVIE: Are you drunk , man ? It 's two in the morning . What do you want ? Why are you inging me here ?
CLOUGH: They 're loyal to you . Thought you 'd like to know that . Loyal to Big Daddy Don..
REVIE: For God 's sake go to sleep . Where 's you dignity , man ? And do n't call here again .
LONGSON: Get me today 's team sheet , will you ? He lets the curtain fall..
CLOUGH: What 's up , Uncle Sam ? Bit below stairs for you here , is n't it ? Taken a wrong turn somewhere ?
LONGSON: Just seen the team sheet . Hinton , O'Hare , Todd , Mackay . That 's our strongest side .
CLOUGH: Of course it 's our strongest side . It 's Leeds United . Would you prefer I sent out the apprentices ?
LONGSON: We 're at Juventus mid-week . Semi-final of the European Cup . Biggest night in the club 's history ! ! Could n't you just field
CLOUGH: What ?
LONGSON: Y'know
CLOUGH: A weaker side ? Am I hearing right ? Is the CHAIRMAN of this football clu seriously asking his manager to LOSE ?
LONGSON: You know what I mean..
CLOUGH: Against their biggest rivals ?
LONGSON: The Chairman of this football club is asking his manager to be pragmatic . Manage his resources . Prioritise . We 've embarked on a huge program of efurbishment and improvements . New stands . Better floodlights . We need a good run in Europe to pay for it .
CLOUGH: I 'm going to pretend I did n't hear a word of this .
LONGSON: We 've still got twenty minutes before kick-off . I 'd reconsider if I were you . I would n't want my employer to be unhappy..
CLOUGH: My employer ?
LONGSON: Chairman of Derby County . And Chairman LONG before you ever showed up .
CLOUGH: That 's right . You were Chairman of Derby County before I came here . I emember that . When Derby County were at the fucking foot of the Second Division , when nobody had heard of them for twenty years and nobody had heard of Sam bloody Longson ever . Full stop . And that 's where you 'd still fucking be if it was n't for me ; at the foot of the bloody Second Division , where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you . There would BE no Derby County without me , no league title , no Champions of England ; not without Brian Clough .
LONGSON: I 'm going to give you some good advice , Brian Clough .
TAYLOR: What have you done now ?
CLOUGH: You 're a bloody disgrace ! You should e in the book for that , Cherry !
BREMNER: Good luck in Europe..
LONGSON: You fucking idiot .
BARBARA: There 's Dad , look !
SON: Wait.. ! Look.. !
CLOUGH: it 's what happens if you have a Chairman who authorizes a multi- million pound refurbishment of the director 's box and hospitality suites efore he pays for a proper squad . Suppose it depends on your priorities . Players or prawn sandwiches ? I know which I 'd prefer . I know which honest , working class Derby supporters would prefer , too..
MCGOVERN: Billy Bremner , Boss .
CLOUGH: Who else ?
MCGOVERN: Norman Hunter .
CLOUGH: Who else ?
MCGOVERN: Eddie Gray .
CLOUGH: Who else ?
MCGOVERN: Peter Lorimer .
CLOUGH: What are they saying ?
MACKENZIE: That you 're never here . That they 're worried about the future . That you 're just going to fill the place with more Derby players .
MCGOVERN: And that all thing 's considered they were all a lot happier under
CLOUGH: Under who ? MCGOVERN dries . Can not find the words.. CLOUGH Don Revie ?
MCGOVERN: Yes , Boss .
CLOUGH: That he 's the boss ? The Guvnor ? The Capi di Tutti Fucking Capi ?
MCGOVERN: Yes , Boss .
O'HARE: And that they miss the bingo .
CLOUGH: The bingo ?
MCGOVERN: And the carpet bowls .
CLOUGH: Carpet bloody bowls ?
MCGOVERN: It helps them relax before a game . MCGOVERN and O'HARE stare at one another..
O'HARE: That it , Boss ? Can we go now ?
CLOUGH: What 's all this ?
JIMMY: Club cars . Complimentary for the senior payers . Brand new .
CLOUGH: Nice to meet you , pet . Now , you can take your lovely sports cars , and put ` em back on your transporter..
REPRESENTATIVE: What ?
BREMNER: What are you talking about ? These are ours !
CLOUGH: You 'll have complimentary cars when you deserve a compliment . Right now you do n't deserve a complimentary icycle between you .
BARBARA: What are you doing here ? Are n't you supposed to be in that hotel in Leeds ?
CLOUGH: I could n't stand it for another night . CLOUGH takes off his coat
BARBARA: What ? So you drove all the way ? What time will you have to get up in the morning
CLOUGH: Half five . CLOUGH bends down . Kisses his wife . CLOUGH You smell nice .
BARBARA: Do I ?
CLOUGH: Forgotten what a woman smells like . BARBARA strokes his head .
BARBARA: Not like bloody men . That 's for sure .
CLOUGH: You still awake ? You should be asleep .
NIGEL: Tell us a joke , Dad ?
CLOUGH: A joke ? All right . There 's this bloke walking about in London , when all of a sudden , the city gets hit by a Russian ` A ' bomb . Booooooooom . CLOUGH sits down , strokes his son 's head.. CLOUGH And all the buildings have fallen down . And all the people are dead . And now this bloke is the only man left in the whole of London . CLOUGH continues stroking his son 's hair.. CLOUGH And he suddenly feels very , very lonely because there 's no one else to talk to . Nobody else but him .
JIMMY: The Chairman wants to see you . Said it was important . Right away .
BOLTON: About bloody time .
CUSSINS: Where you been ? I was about to send out a search party .
CLOUGH: Look , Mr. Cussins , I know it 's not een the best of starts , but in my defence , there are a couple of things I 'd like to say
CUSSINS: This is Martin Hughes . He runs Mercedes here in the North .
CLOUGH: What ?
CUSSINS: We hear that 's what you like to drive . A Mercedes ?
CLOUGH: It's..what I used to drive at Derby . Yes .
CUSSINS: Well , we ca n't have Leeds United being outdone by Derby County , can we ? So Martin here is going to take you ove to his showroom and get you sorted out .
BOLTON: Never come between a footballer and his motor !
CLOUGH: No .
BOLTON: Especially not Billy bloody Bremner . CLOUGH smiles nervously , visibly relieved
CLOUGH: Is that it , then ?
CUSSINS: Why ? You look white as a ghost , man .
CLOUGH: Heart attack , eh ?
TAYLOR: Had it three weeks ago , they reckon .
CLOUGH: We have . Longson 's tried to put a gagging order on me , of course . `` Any further utterances in public o appearances in the media by Brian Clough will be met with instant dismissal . ''
TAYLOR: Well , I hope you take notice . And act accordingly .
CLOUGH: Would you like to hear my contrite eply ? CLOUGH pulls out a letter.. CLOUGH `` Due to the complete breakdown in communication with the chairman , Pete Taylor and I find it is impossible to continue our good work for Derby County . We therefore wish to tende our resignations with immediate effect . ''
CLOUGH: What do you think ?
TAYLOR: I do n't want to resign .
CLOUGH: No . Nor do I . Do n't worry , they 'll never let us . We just won them the championship . But it will strengthen our position and force them to get rid of Longson .
TAYLOR: What ? Oh , no , Brian . They 'll never do THAT . He 's Chairman .
CLOUGH: I ca n't do it , Pete . I ca n't work with my hands tied , a Chairman telling me what I can or can not do .
TAYLOR: You 're picking the wrong enemy . The enemy 's not Longson . It 's Revie . And your obsession with Leeds .
CLOUGH: Do n't be daft . We won the league , Pete . We 're top dogs in Derby now . And Longson ca n't stand it . That 's the problem .
TAYLOR: No , it 's not . It 's YOU . This monste in you . This mad ambition . It comes and goes . Sometimes it 's gooda fire , that stirs everything up , and then there 's thisthis thing that takes you overand destroys everything that is good in your life . TAYLOR 's face TAYLOR Please tell me this letter is just a draft . You have n't sent it . Because I 'll be out in a couple of dayslet me talk to them .
CLOUGH: What are you doing ? You were n't supposed to accept our resignations .
LONGSON: ` Should n't bloody well offer them , then . CLOUGH turns to the other DIRECTORS
CLOUGH: I only did because of HIM ! You ca n't get rid of us . It 'd be a disaster for the club . For the whole of Derby .
LONGSON: You ca n't keep shooting your mouth off the way you have beenor issuing these ultimatums..
CLOUGH: You ca n't do this ! It 's madness !
LONGSON: The decision stands . And do n't even think of a settlement . You 're getting nowt .
CLOUGH: We 're going to create a footballing dynasty here . Derby could be one of the greats alongside United , Liverpool , Leeds..
LONGSON: Car keys on the table and out !
CLOUGH: Does none of you have the guts to stop this ?
LONGSON: Now ! And do n't show your faces here again !
JIMMY: `` To the directors of Derby County Football Club . We , the undersigned players , are unanimous in our support and respect for Mr. Clough and Mr. Taylor and ask that they be reinstated as manager and assistant manager of the club . ''
TAYLOR: But not Dave Mackay .
CLOUGH: What ? Dave MACKAY ?
TAYLOR: It 's in the evening paper .
CLOUGH: I signed that fat fuck - saved his professional life . Gave him two more years as a player , as my captain . Dave Mackay ? He would n't fucking DARE !
TAYLOR: Why did you do it ? I love this place , Brian . I 'm happy here . So are you .
CLOUGH: It 's not over yet , Pete . The lawyers are issuing a writ tomorrow . Against Longson . The players are calling a meeting . There 's talk of them coming out on strike . There 's protest marches scheduled for this week-end .
TAYLOR: Why could n't you just have kept you mouth shut ? We 'll never find anywhere like this again .
BARBARA: Mike Bamber on the phone ?
CLOUGH: Who 's Mike Bamber ? ?
TAYLOR: Manager of Brighton and Hove Albion . Someone who wants to offer us a job .
CUSSINS: Players Lounge , Brian . Ten minutes .
BREMNER: Perhaps if Mr. Clough were to step outside , we would all feel a little more like speaking our minds . CLOUGH ca n't help smiling..
CLOUGH: You bastard .
CUSSINS: All right . If you would n't mind , Brian ? Just for a minute or two ?
CLOUGH: As you wish .
VOICE: What 's going on ? CLOUGH turns to see JIMMY GORDON..
CLOUGH: The last two words of every story eve written is what 's going on . `` The fucking end . ''
JIMMY: I 'm not staying here without you . No loody way .
CLOUGH: Then I suggest you go home and do the same .
CLOUGH: `` Oh , I do n't like to be beside the seaside.. ''
TAYLOR: C'mon , just give it a chance .
CLOUGH: Brighton and Hove Albion ? Have you seen where they are ? Bottom of the third division .
TAYLOR: And we can get them out of there . Like that . We did it with Hartlepools . We did it with Derby .
CLOUGH: We cared about Hartlepools and Derby . We 're from the North , Pete . What do we care about Brighton ? Bloody Southerners . Look where we are . We 're almost in France .
TAYLOR: Hey , they 've got money , this lot . And ambition . And get a lungful of that air . It 'd be good for my health .
CLOUGH: You ca n't manage a team that 's not your own people . Not what you know . Anyway the Protest Movement in Derby is still in full flow . We could still get our jobs back .
TAYLOR: No , we wo n't . It 's over , Brian . They 'll never take us back . Not now .
CLOUGH: What about proper clubs ? Like Manchester United ? Or Spurs ? O England , now Alf 's gone . Would n't you fancy that ?
TAYLOR: No one 's rung , have they ? You 've scared them all off .
CLOUGH: It 's only been a couple of weeks .
TAYLOR: C'mon . Just listen to them ? Please ? For me ?
BAMBER: Sign today , I 'll give you a bonus of seven grand . Each .
TAYLOR: Seven grand ? Y'hear that , Brian ?
BAMBER: Plus a salary that exceeds by twenty percent what Derby were paying you .
TAYLOR: Very generous , Mike . Terrific .
CLOUGH: But those are first division wages .
BAMBER: First division 's where I want this club to be .
CLOUGH: Are you sure you can afford it ?
BAMBER: Are you sure you 're worth it ?
CLOUGH: Cheeky sod . BAMBER offers his hand . CLOUGH stares at it.. CLOUGH We 're going to need a holiday first .
BAMBER: Take as long as you like .
CLOUGH: Two weeks . Somewhere hot . On you . BAMBER does n't even flinch . Smiles..
BAMBER: I 'll even throw in the bloody trunks .
ARCHER: You 're a hard man to find , Mr. Clough .
CLOUGH: Who 's looking ?
ARCHER: My name 's Keith Archer . Secretary of Leeds United football club . CLOUGH looks up , ca n't help smiling..
CLOUGH: Then what are you doing here , Keith ? Because from what I 'm reading in my paper , and from what I hear on the jungle drums , you 've got a bit of a problem at home with your manage flirting with the England job .
ARCHER: He 's not flirting
CLOUGH: ` Ey , it says it right here .
ARCHER: He 's taken it . CLOUGH turns , squints in the light ARCHER Which bring me to the point of my visit .
TAYLOR: Bloody hell . But we HATE Leeds .
CLOUGH: It 's the top flight , Pete . The First Division .
TAYLOR: But we 've given Brighton our word . And they 've paid us the money .
CLOUGH: We can pay BACK the money . Bollocks to loody Brighton . I 'd go mad . We 'd ALL go mad down there .
TAYLOR: Pleasegive it a year . Give it a chance .
CLOUGH: A year ? It 'd be death . Death for us all .
TAYLOR: Mike Bamber is a good man..
CLOUGH: Oh , do me a favour..
TAYLOR: He had faith in us , offered us a jo when no one would .
CLOUGH: He offered us a job . And now someone else has offered us a better one..and not just anyone . The best team in the country . C'mon , Pete , you know what that means.. It 'd be the Charity Shield at Wembley in a months time . The European Cup after..
TAYLOR: Yes , but even if we won them it would always be Revie 's achievements . HIS team..
CLOUGH: What ? And you 'd sooner fester down there ? With all those fucking Tories ? In that blue-rinse retirement home by the sea ?
TAYLOR: Yes , Brighton is a small club..
CLOUGH: Fucking midgets .
TAYLOR: But at least we 'd be together , you and me . We could build them up . Make them our own . Like we did with Hartlepools . Like we did with Derby .
CLOUGH: And then what ? Bottle again as soon as it comes to the big time . That 's always been the trouble with you , Pete . No ambition .
TAYLOR: And that 's the trouble with you . Too much ambition . Too much greed . Too much everything .
CLOUGH: You knock it , but it 's done you proud over the years . My `` ambition '' . Without me - you 'd still be stuck in Burton Albion . On the arse of the footballing earth .
TAYLOR: But without you I 'd still have a jo in Derby . A job and a home that I love . Yes , Brian - you 're the shop window , I 'll grant you that . The razzle and the bloody dazzle . But I 'm the goods at the back . And without me , without someone to save you from yourself , you 're not just half.. you 're nothing .
CLOUGH: I 'm nothing ? I 'm nothing ? ? Do n't make me laugh ? So what does that make you , Taylor ? Something ? ? You 're half of nothing ! ! Nothing 's parasite ! A big fat pilot fish that FEEDS on nothing ! ! A bloody nobody ! ! The forgotten man ! ! History 's fucking afterthought ! ! TAYLOR walks off , leaving CLOUGH
TAYLOR: Well , let 's see , shall we ?
CUSSINS: Let 's be honest . It 's not working , is it ?
CLOUGH: What 's not working ? I have n't been here five minutes , so how can anything e working yet ?
CUSSINS: Stillthe players are n't happy . We 're not happy .
CLOUGH: So what do you want to do about it ?
CUSSINS: If it 's not working , then we 'll have to part company .
CLOUGH: Fine . It 'll cost you twenty-five grand . The Leeds BOARD MEMBERS choke
CUSSINS: What ? For six weeks work ?
CLOUGH: Plus three and a half grand for Jimmy Gordon . And an agreement that Leeds United will pay both our income taxes for the next three years . The Leeds BOARD MEMBERS choke
CUSSINS: That 's bloody criminal .
CLOUGH: No , what 's criminal , Mr. Cussins , is the way you as Chairman asked me to leave the room like that in front of the players . Your MANAGER . Going ehind my back like that .
CUSSINS: I admit , that was wrong .
CLOUGH: And you can throw in the Merc and all .
BOLTON: What ?
CLOUGH: Might be a bit flash for a man out of a job , but the truth is , I 've grown to like it .
CUSSINS: Who the bloody hell do you think you are ?
CLOUGH: Brian Clough . Brian Howard Clough .
CUSSINS: Aye . No danger of me forgetting THAT name in a hurry .
MACKENZIE: Just wanted to say , it 's not right . They should have given you more time .
CLOUGH: Good lad .
MACKENZIE: Not just me that feels that way , either .
CLOUGH: The sad thing is , it wo n't work . You ca n't change a manager like a pair of socks . It 'll happen once , to me - and never again . CLOUGH shakes CLARKE 's hand .
MITCHELL: Thanks for agreeing to this .
CLOUGH: No problem .
FLOOR MANAGER: Five , four , three.. The PRESENTER looks up..
MITCHELL: Good evening . Tonight the football world was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of Leeds United . We 'll be talking not just to Brian Clough , but also to the man he replaced , who 's success he could n't emulate , Don Revie . MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH.. MITCHELL To Brian Clough first of all . What 's your reaction to being sacked in this fashion ?
CLOUGH: Obviously , Austin , my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie
REVIE: See ? Not so easy to make accusations when it 's to someone 's face
CLOUGH: but in answer to your question , six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job . I would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his .
MITCHELL: Do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes , Don Revie ? To eplace you ?
REVIE: Being very , very honest , I think it was a difficult job for anyone to do . But I do feel Brian Clough , I wo n't call him Clough because I wo n't take him down like that..
CLOUGH: Thank you .
REVIE: I do feel he made it harder fo himself than he need have .
CLOUGH: How did I do that , Don ?
REVIE: Shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were .
CLOUGH: Well , you WERE dirty , Don !
REVIE: That 's not true . The last fou seasons , we 've topped the charts fo entertaining football .
CLOUGH: And before that , you also topped ALL the disciplinary charts . You should have been docked points and sent DOWN to the second Division .
MITCHELL: And in fact , you went on record and said so , Brian Clough . Again and again . That Leeds should , in fact , be elegated .
CLOUGH: And I was right .
MITCHELL: Do you think that might have hurt you chances of success when you then came to manage them ?
REVIE: Of course it did ! The things he said ? Why , man ? Why did you take the job in the first place ?
CLOUGH: Because I thought it was the best jo in the country .
REVIE: Of course it was the best job in the country .
CLOUGH: I was taking over the League Champions .
REVIE: You were . You were taking over the est bunch of players you 'd ever seen .
CLOUGH: And I fancied winning the league , and winning Europe , and doing it bette than you .
REVIE: There 's no way you COULD win it etter .
CLOUGH: But that 's the only hope I 've got .
REVIE: I only lost four matches..
CLOUGH: Well , I can only lose three .
REVIE: No , no , no , no .
CLOUGH: And still play attractive , clean football . Without cheating !
REVIE: See , there he goes again..
MITCHELL: Listening to you , I am struck that this is not just a business matter fo you both . It 's more than that . It 's personal . Am I right ?
CLOUGH: Well , we 're very different people , Don and I . We have different styles . In football and in life . I 'm a warm man . An idealist . I do believe in faeries , and that is my outlook . Don is different . There 's a hardness to him . A hardness . Maybe he 's not even aware of it . But he 's a cold person .
REVIE: You do n't KNOW me !
CLOUGH: And that lack of warmth . That coldness was there . Permeated the club when I arrived .
REVIE: I totally refute that . The atmosphere at Leeds was like a family . A happy family . You ask any of my players . I signed most of them personally . Knew their backgrounds . Their parents . Their streets . I was a father to them . In that club every morning . Massaging those boys . Did you do that for them ?
CLOUGH: They would never have let me .
REVIE: Did you try ? You did n't even try . I soaped those boys down with my own hands . You just went to Leeds with no thought for the club , no thought fo the players . Just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me .
CLOUGH: Well are you surprised ? What else was I going to do ? ? After what you did
REVIE: What did I do ?
CLOUGH: C'mon , Don . You know exactly .
REVIE: Never ! Matter of principle ! I always shake the other manager 's hand !
CLOUGH: You shook Peter Taylor 's hand , and my trainer , Jimmy Gordon 's .
REVIE: Then I probably did n't see you ! !
CLOUGH: No , you saw me Don . But considered me eneath you . Looked down on me . And dismissed me . Just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country .
REVIE: Never would I knowingly refuse to shake a colleague 's hand . The truth is , I probably just did n't know who you were .
CLOUGH: `` Did n't know who I was ! '' Pull the other one .
REVIE: It 's the truth .
CLOUGH: Well , you certainly know it NOW .
REVIE: Oh , we ALL know it now . We know you as the man who 's constant outbursts , his defaming of fellow professionals , have brought this game , this beautiful game into disrepute . Who had one of the best jobs in the country , at Derby , and managed to get the sack . Who had one of the best partners in the game , in Peter Taylor , and threw him away . Who was given the greatest gift in British football Leeds United , a team that in ten years has n't finished outside the top four , and took them to the bottom of the first division . Yes , it 's fair to say we all know who you are now . AUSTIN MITCHELL 's eyes widen .
MITCHELL: OK , gentlemen , we 're going to have to leave it there..
CLOUGH: Well , let 's see where we are in a year 's time , Donald Revie .
REVIE: Dear oh dear..
CLOUGH: Let 's see where we both are in five !
AUSTIN MITCHELL: That 's it for tonight 's show . I 'd like to thank Brian Clough and Don Revie for joining me
REVIE: Thank you , Austin .
CLOUGH: Boys ? Do you think your old man is a fool ?
TAYLOR: They 've kicked you out , already ?
CLOUGH: They have .
TAYLOR: So how long was that ?
CLOUGH: Forty-four days .
TAYLOR: Impressive . TAYLOR strains not to show his satisfaction.. TAYLOR So what are you doing here ?
CLOUGH: Do n't make this difficult for me , Peteyou know why I 'm hereand I wo n't bloody grovel .
TAYLOR: `` I apologize unreservedly for being a twat '' .
CLOUGH: I apologize for being a twat .
TAYLOR: `` Unreservedly . ''
CLOUGH: Unreservedly
TAYLOR: `` Because I ca n't do it without you . ''
CLOUGH: Because I ca n't do it without you .
TAYLOR: `` I 'm nothing without you . ''
CLOUGH: I 'm nothing without you .
TAYLOR: `` Please , please baby , take me back . ''
CLOUGH: Fuck off.. !
TAYLOR: You 'll only fuck me up again , wo n't you ?
CLOUGH: I love you , y'know .
TAYLOR: I know . But it wo n't stop you . A beat . CLOUGH thinks , then..
CLOUGH: So ? Would you sooner go through it all without me ?
TAYLOR: Never .

DUNBAR: I 'm wondering sir , how will I be getting there ?
FAMBROUGH: You think I do n't know ?
DUNBAR: No sir , it 's just that I do n't know .

TEN BEARS: I am glad to hear it . But the buffalo are late . I always worry about the ellies of our children . A brief silence .
KICKING BIRD: I was thinking of a dance .
TEN BEARS: Yes , a dance is always a good idea . It would be good to have a strong sign .
KICKING BIRD: Yes .
TEN BEARS: There 's a funny thing about signs . They are always flying in our faces . We know when they are bad or good ut sometimes they are strange and there is no way to understand them . Sometimes they make people crazy but a smart man will take such a sign into himself and let it run around for two or three days . If he is still confused he will tell somebody . He might come to you or to me and tell it . A smart man always does that .
KICKING BIRD: I have seen such a sign .
TEN BEARS: Oh ?
KICKING BIRD: I saw a man , a white man .
TEN BEARS: Just one ?
KICKING BIRD: Just one . He was naked . Ten Bears thinks some more .
TEN BEARS: Are you sure it was a man ?

TEN BEARS: Did you speak to him ?
KICKING BIRD: No .
TEN BEARS: We will council on this .
KICKING BIRD: He might be a god or he might be a special chief that 's why we are thinking of having a talk with him .
TEN BEARS: It is easy to become confused by these questions . It is hard to know what to do . No man can tell anothe how he will be . But I know this killing a white man is a delicate matter . If you kill one , more are sure to come . We should talk about this some more .
WORM: Otter does n't want to go . Smiles a Lot trots his pony over to Otter .
OTTER: Maybe .
WORM: I will be when my father finds out , his bow will be across my back .
COURIER: The party that went against the Pawnee is coming in Wind In His Hair says nothing .
DUNBAR: Wait
KICKING BIRD: The soldier did not come to fight he is going away and we will let him .
TEN BEARS: I am in agreement with Kicking Bird . We will go down and talk to the white man and find out what kind of white man he is . Wind In His Hair jumps into the conversation .
DUNBAR: Welcome Come please sit down .
KICKING BIRD: Buffalo .
DUNBAR: Buffalo ?
KICKING BIRD: Buffalo .
DUNBAR: Buffalo .

KICKING BIRD: Where is loo ten tant ?
DUNBAR: They asked me to dance The medicine man says nothing .
STONE CALF: You were right about loo ten tant he is a special white man . Kicking Bird watches Dunbar as he replies .
KICKING BIRD: Yes , he is special he should have a real name .
DUNBAR: Thank you I feel good .
KICKING BIRD: Ask him why he is at the soldie fort .
DUNBAR: Wait what is your name ?
KICKING BIRD: What does he say ?

KICKING BIRD: Are you certain of this ?
BLACK SHAWL: When you see them together you will know . Kicking Bird stares wearily across the floor .
KICKING BIRD: What are people saying ? They 're not angry ?
BLACK SHAWL: No . They like the match . It makes sense . They are both white .
KICKING BIRD: I suppose I will be the one to say something . A brief silence .
BLACK SHAWL: She 's your daughter now .
KICKING BIRD: Stands With A Fist .
WORM: Dances With Wolves ' door is closed alot these days .
OTTER: I know that .
WORM: Maybe they 're having a hard time . Some people have a hard time .

MISTER BLACK: I hear a clock in my head , and I like it ! MEN We hear clocks in our heads , and we like it !
MEN: A world in our likeness !
BUMSTEAD: Please . Not that way . If you could just follow the covering - the carpet gets stained and it 's impossible to clean .
WHITE: If you shoot them here you can kill them . They 're not people - like us - got insects in their heads Got any disinfectant ?
BUMSTEAD: Here . Careful with your trousers . That stuff stains .
BARBER: He with you shortly , sir
BUMSTEAD: I did n't tell you the entire reason I helped you . It started with two little girls . Twins . Used to play with them when I was young . Could n't emember for the life of me what they looked like , then I understood why
WHITE: What ?
BUMSTEAD: That 's right . Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads . No mistake . I just had n't remembered it that way . Up until then they had een normal little girls in my memory . That 's not all . Once I started examining them , all sorts of things about my life , had inconsistencies . It was like a game . I would think about a person or a place , or an event . Then I would turn the lights off . Sit down in a comfortable chair And study each detail of this subject . He glances at White , then back to the road .
WHITE: Well . The only thing I 've been certain of , all this time , is that I need to get to the ocean . The point is no one seems to know how to get there .
BUMSTEAD: Why , that 's ridiculous . You just He trails off . Shakes his head slowly .
SCHREBER: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
BUMSTEAD: That 's surprising . He was leaving your office at the time
SCHREBER: You are mistaken .
WHITE: What are you hiding ?
SCHREBER: Nothing . I do n't know anything !
BUMSTEAD: I think it 's time you introduced us to your little friends .
SCHREBER: In there .
BUMSTEAD: Just like that ?
BUMSTEAD: What is this place ?
SCHREBER: You would n't believe me if I told you , Inspector . Have patience - you 'll see for yourself .
WHITE: Look .
SCHREBER: Put them on .
WHITE: Where do you think this goes ?
BUMSTEAD: It sure is n't the fun-fair .
SCHREBER: Follow me , and do exactly as I do .
MAN 2: The Eye is too small for the head of the pin !
MAN 1: Yes !
MAN 3: What is it that floats on the water ? The Eye !
MAN 1: Indeed !
BUMSTEAD: What ? SCHREBER is next - he stands abruptly .
SCHREBER: The eye . Master of time and space ! Then it 's Bumstead 's turn .
BUMSTEAD: The Eye - um - delicious with horseradish on rye !
WHITE: Eye eye , captain !
MAN 1: Um - yes
MAN 4: My spine will bend for the Eye ! He turns sideways , still floating .
BUMSTEAD: Was that for real down there ?
SCHREBER: I 'm afraid so .
BUMSTEAD: What the hell is that ?
WHITE: What now ?
BUMSTEAD: This ocean business I know where I can find a map . I need to go back to the station . Where will you be ?
WHITE: I 'll go see an uncle of mine . Five - one - eight - three - double six - three
BUMSTEAD: Good . Uh-oh White turns and looks behind them . HIS P.O.V . - HEADLIGHTS gaining on them .
BUMSTEAD: Jump !
TICKET SELLER: Yeah . That 's what I said ! What.. ?
WHITE: I 'm looking for this address .
TICKET SELLER: Upstairs . Through there .
MAN: Are you alright ? What are you doing here ? Is this one of your jokes , John ? It 's been so long , I thought you 'd forgotten your uncle Karl ?
WHITE: Uncle Karl .
KARL: And this is me again about - um - I would guess about twelve feet furthe to the right of the last shot . Now just behind the wall is the hotel I stayed at - sweet little place
WHITE: Yes ? Oh , it 's you Yes My uncle apparently Just looking at some memories You have ? That 's good .
BUMSTEAD: At first I thought there was no way to get to the ocean The buildings are a barrier , no windows , no doors - everything just , well , ends - only thing would be drill a hole . But then , I saw it , one door , just one Inside a tenement building
WHITE: Where can we meet ? Alright . Good
KARL: Look ! This is a good one !
WHITE: What is that door ?
KARL: Which one ?
WHITE: There . Behind the cabinet . Where does it go ? The uncle watches the slides .
KARL: Such a joker ! Like your father .
WHITE: No . Have a look . He leads the old man over to the cabinet .
KARL: Yes .
WHITE: Where does it lead ?
KARL: It must be a closet or something .
WHITE: No !
BUMSTEAD: I ca n't wait any longer
NURSE: I 'm sorry . I told you , she is being examined
SURGEON: We will teach the pig to meddle in our affairs . Yes .
BUMSTEAD: But she was getting better
SURGEON: We are sorry . The cancer - it was fatal .
BUMSTEAD: She does n't have cancer .
SURGEON: We knew that . Yes . Anyway - she is dead .
MYSTERY MAN: You will obey us , yes . In your mind there is a dark space
WHITE: Nice knowing you . TIGHT ON WHITE 'S HAND - It pulls a lever . THE CONTAINER - Shakes and starts to fall .
BUMSTEAD: White ?
STROMBOLI: Why do you always have to find things out the hard way ! Could n't you just do your job , you idiot ? I told you , did n't I ? These people are not playing games , Bumstead . They can do anything they want , do n't you understand ? BUMSTEAD You 're one of them . You bastard STROMBOLI In a way , we all are , inspector ! You . Me . Everybody !
FIGURE: Ahhh it hurts !
WHITE: What happened to you ?
SCHREBER: I 'm being punished .
WHITE: What is it ?
SCHREBER: We are living in their dreams
BUMSTEAD: Gesundheit !
WHITE: I did n't sneeze .
MAN 1: We are looking for the White victims .
MORTICIAN: And who the hell are you ?
MAN 1: Thank you .
MYSTERY MAN: There is nothing , Mister White . Beyond the city . Never has been . Unfortunate . Yes ? White is led into a pitch black room .
WHITE: How did you know where to find me ?
MYSTERY MAN: We knew you would turn up here eventually Been waiting for you , yes . Hoped you would n't make a nuisance of yourself on the way
MISTER BLACK: Welcome .
FATHER: That 's right .
MOTHER: Yes .
WHITE: Wait a minute
MISTER SLACK: You had your turn ! Let them speak . WHITE My parents are supposed to be dead ! You ca n't keep changing the damn ules like this ! Why go through this idiculous set-up ! Why do n't you just kill me and be done with it ! MISTER BLACK Please , continue
WHITE: This is insane ! He looks over to the victims .
MISTER BLACK: A fanciful idea , Mister White .
WHITE: Everyone has a job - a function . Each one teaches you more about you invention . I 'm what is called a u > murderer .
MISTER BLACK: Ah - a plot . Now we have a plot ! Very inventive
MOTHER: Please , John , you 're embarrassing us
WHITE: Shut up ! MISTER BLACK You have proof ? Evidence ? Yes ? WHITE It 's all here !
MISTER BLACK: A book of delusions . Anything else ?
WHITE: But I
MISTER BLACK: I see . The verdict , yes
WHITE: Wait , this is n't fair
MISTER BLACK: Before I pronounce sentence
WHITE: I did n't realise
MISTER BLACK: Shut up , freak ! Monster ! You are insignificant .
FIGURE: Good as new . Yes . Everything is easier now .
FAT MAN: It 's small but clean and the view 's nice . Is n't it ?
WHITE: Yes
WOMAN: What 's your name ?
WHITE: John White .
GORDON: But I knew Harvey Dent . I washis friend . And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did .
CIA MAN: Dr. Pavel , I 'm CIA .
DRIVER: He was n't alone .
CIA MAN: You do n't get to bring friends .
SHAKEN: They are not my friends .
DRIVER: Do n't worry , no charge for them .
CIA MAN: Why would I want them ?
DRIVER: They were trying to grab you prize . They work for the mercenary . The masked man .
EXCITED: Bane ?
CIA MAN: Get 'em on board - I 'll call it in .
THIRD PRISONER: We are nothing . We are the dirt eneath your feet . And no one cared who I was until I put on the mask
BANE: Who we are does not matter . What matters is our plan .
FASCINATED: If I pull this off , will you die ?
BANE: It would be extremely painful .
CIA MAN: You 're a big guy -
BANE: For you .
UNNERVED: Was being caught part of your plan ?
BANE: Of course . Dr. Pavel refused ou offer in favor of yours . We had to know what he told you about us .
DR. PAVEL: Nothing ! I said nothing !
CIA MAN: Why not just ask him ?
BANE: He would not have told us .
CIA MAN: You have methods .
BANE: Him , I need healthy . You present no such problem .
SERGEANT: Sir ?
CIA MAN: Well congratulations , you got yourselves caught . What 's the next step of your master plan ?
BANE: Crashing this plane
RISING: With no survivors .
BANE: Friend . They expect one of us in the wreckage .
NODS: The fire rises .
BANE: Calm , Doctor . Now is not time fo fear
MAYOR: This city has seen a historic turnaround . No city is without crime . But this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob . Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act . And to them I saynot on my watch . Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up . I want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event . I 'm told Mr. Wayne could n't be here tonight , but I 'm sure he 's with us in spirit
CONGRESSMAN: Commissioner .
GORDON: Congressman .
CONGRESSMAN: Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things ?
FOLEY: No one has . Not in years .
CONGRESSMAN: Sweetheart , not so fast with the chow .
MAID: Shrimp balls ?
CONGRESSMAN: Jesus , Gordon , is that your speech ? We 're gon na be here all night .
GORDON: Maybe the truth about Harvey is n't so simple , Congressman .
CONGRESSMAN: Thank Christ for that
GORDON: Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act . These are violent criminals , essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long . Maybe , for now , all I should say about Harvey Dent 's death is thisit has not een for nothing .
FOLEY: On your desk . But you should put in some more time with the Mayor -
GORDON: That 's your department .
CONGRESSMAN: Anyone shown him the crime stats ?
FOLEY: He goes by his gut , and it continues to bother him , whateve the numbers .
CONGRESSMAN: Must be popular with the wife .
FOLEY: Not really . She took the kids and moved to Cleveland .
CONGRESSMAN: He 'll have plenty of time fo visits . Mayor 's dumping him in the spring .
FOLEY: Really ? He 's a hero .
CONGRESSMAN: War hero . This is peacetime . Stay smart , the job 's yours .
MAID 2: They say he never leaves the East Wing .
MAID 3: I heard he had an accident - that he 's disfigured .
ALFRED: Mr. Till , why are your people using the main stairs ?
MAID: She 's up at the bar , sir . Can I help ?
ALFRED: The East drawing room . Unlock the door , place the tray on the table , lock the door again . Nothing more .
MIRANDA: It 's important , Mr. Pennyworth . Her accent is European . Hard to place .
ALFRED: Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones .
DAGGETT: Everyone knows Wayne 's holed up in there with eight-inch nails , peeing into Mason jars . Good of you to let me on the grounds .
ALFRED: The Dent Act is about all Gotham . Even you , Mr. Daggett . Miss Tate , always a pleasure .
DAGGETT: Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project ? He ca n't help you get you money back . But I can .
MIRANDA: I could try explaining that a save-the-world project , vain o not , is worth investing in , whatever the return . I could try , Mr. Daggett , but you understand only money and the power you think it buys , so why waste my time , indeed ? She walks away . Daggett watches her go .
MAID: I 'm , I 'm terribly sorry , Mr. Wayne . It is Mr. Wayne , is n't it ? Wayne nods , gently . Limps towards her .
WAYNE: Is that what they say about me ?
MAID: It 's just thatnobody sees you
WAYNE: That 's a beautiful necklace . Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother . It ca n't be the same one - her pearls are in this safe -
MAID: Oops . No one told me it was uncrackable .
WAYNE: I 'm afraid I ca n't let you take those . She smiles at him . Moves towards him .
MAID: Look , you would n't hit a woman any more than I would beat up a cripple .
CONGRESSMAN: You read my mind .
ALFRED: Miss Tate was asking to see you again .
WAYNE: She 's very persistent .
ALFRED: And quite lovely , in case you were wondering .
WAYNE: I was n't .
ALFRED: What are you doing ?
WAYNE: Examining print dust . We 've been obbed .
ALFRED: And this is your idea of raising the alarm ?
SHRUGS: She took the pearls . Tracking device and all .
ALFRED: She ?
WAYNE: One of the maids , perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house .
ALFRED: Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed , then . Why are you dusting for prints ?
WAYNE: I 'm not . She was .
BLAKE: I did n't want to bother you up here , but they 're looking for you .
GORDON: What 's the problem , son ?
BLAKE: Congressman Gilly 's wife 's been calling . He has n't made it home from the Wayne Foundation event .
GORDON: That 's a job for the police ?
BLAKE: Sir , I 've been a cop for a year and I 've only logged half a dozen arrests . When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good . Pretty soon we 'll be chasing overdue library books .
GORDON: Old habits .
BLAKE: Or instinct .
GORDON: What 's your name , son ?
BLAKE: Blake , sir .
GORDON: You have something you want to ask me , Officer Blake ?
BLAKE: It 's that night . This night , eight years ago . The night Dent died .
GORDON: What about it ?
BLAKE: The last confirmed sighting of the Batman . He murders those people , takes out two SWAT teams , breaks Dent 's neckthen just vanishes ?
GORDON: I 'm not hearing a question , son . Blake shifts uneasily . Then looks at Gordon .
BLAKE: Do n't you want to know who we was ?
GORDON: I know exactly who he was . He was Batman .
ALFRED: Master Wayne ?
WAYNE: Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief . I ran her prints from the photos she handled -
ALFRED: She may be . But we have the trace on the necklace .
WAYNE: We do , so I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end B-and-E 's
ALFRED: We should send the police before she fences the pearls .
WAYNE: She wo n't . She likes them too much . And they were n't what she was after .
ALFRED: What was she after ?
WAYNE: My fingerprints . There was printe toner mixed with graphite on the safe . Gives you a good pull , and it 's untraceable .
ALFRED: Fascinating . Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee .
WAYNE: Now you 're trying to set me up with a jewel thief ?
ALFRED: At this point , sir , I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world .
WAYNE: There 's nothing out there for me .
ALFRED: And that 's the problem . You hung up the cape and cowl , but never moved on . You wo n't get out there and find a life . Find someone -
BITTER: I did find someone , Alfred .
ALFRED: I know . And then you lost them . That 's part of living , sir . But you 're not living - you 're waiting . Hoping for things to go bad again . Wayne says nothing . Remember when you left Gotham ? Before all this . Before Batman . Seven years you were gone . Seven years I waited . Hoping that you would n't come back . Wayne looks at Alfred . Not understanding . Every year I took my holiday . I 'd go to Florence . There 's a café by the Arno Any fine evening I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca
DWP MAN: They wash up a couple times a month . More when in gets colder - homeless sheltering in the tunnels . We had to pull him to clear the asin , but other than that we did n't touch him
ROSS: What ?
BLAKE: Name 's Jimmy . He 's at St. Swithin 's . The boys home where II coach some ball .
FATHER REILLY: Jimmy had n't been here for months .
BLAKE: Why ?
FATHER REILLY: You know why , Blake - he aged out . We do n't have the resources to keep oys on after sixteen -
BLAKE: The Wayne Foundation gives money for that -
FATHER REILLY: Not for two years now .
BLAKE: He has a brother here , right ?
FATHER REILLY: Mark . I 'll tell him .
BLAKE: I 'd like to , if that 's okay .
MARK: Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out . Say you can live down there . Say there 's work down there .
BLAKE: What kind of work are you gon na find in the sewers ?
MARK: More than you can find up here , I guess . Blake considers this . Troubled .
STRYVER: You brought a date ?
SELINA: I like having someone around to open doors for me .
STRYVER: Very nice . He pockets the envelope .
SELINA: Not so fast , handsome . You got something for me ?
STRYVER: Oh , yes .
SELINA: I do n't know what you 're going to do with Mr. Wayne 's printsbut I 'm guessing you 'll need his thumb . As Stryver checks the envelope again -
STRYVER: I count fine . The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina 's head .
SELINA: Okay , okay -
JEN: Place is a little dead .
SELINA: It 'll liven up in a minute , trust me .
JEN: Everything okay ?
SELINA: Great . Catch you later .
STRYVER: We ca n't have loose ends . And even in that dress , no one 's going to miss you .
SELINA: No . But my friend over there ?
STRYVER: Cute . But they 're not gon na be looking in a place like this .
SELINA: I do n't know You did just use his cell phone .
SWAT: It 's alright , Miss . Just stay down
SELINA: Keep some pressure on that , sweetheart .
WEAK: Call me ?
SELINA: There 's a man in there - he 's leeding !
BLAKE: It 's okay , Miss . It 's okay .
GORDON: Manhole !
SWAT: Where - ?
GORDON: Get the DWP down here , now ! Gordon starts climbing down the ladder
COP: Where 's the DWP guy ?
BLAKE: They went down there ?
FOLEY: And Gordon took SWAT in after them .
BLAKE: Come on , we got ta get down there -
COP: That was a gas explosion , kid -
BLAKE: Gas ? This is a sewer !
FOLEY: No one goes in there till we know what 's down there .
BLAKE: We know what 's down there , sir . The Police Commissioner !
FOLEY: Somebody get the hothead out of here . And get me a DWP guy !
THUG 1: This one 's alive . Jesus . It 's the Police Commissioner .
THUG 2: What do we do ?
THUG 1: Take him to Bane .
BANE: Why are you here ? The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane 's feet .
THUG 1: Answer him ! Bane slowly turns to the Thugs .
BANE: I 'm asking you .
THUG 1: It 's the Police Commissioner .
BANE: And you brought him down here ?
THUG 2: We did n't know what to do . We -
BANE: You panicked . And your weakness costs three lives .
THUG 1: No , he 's alone -
BANE: Search him . Then I will kill you .
THUG 2: He 's dead .
BANE: Then show me his body .
THUG 2: That water runs to any one of the outflows - we 'd never find him . Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary .
BANE: Give me your GPS .
THUG 2: Follow him ?
BANE: Track him . Make sure both bodies will not be found . Then brick up the south tunnel .
BLAKE: I need to see Bruce Wayne .
ALFRED: I 'm sorry , Mr. Wayne does n't take unscheduled calls . Even from police officers .
BLAKE: And if I go get a warrant , in the investigation of Harvey Dent 's murder ? Would that still count as unscheduled ?
WAYNE: What can I do for you , officer ?
BLAKE: Commissioner Gordon 's been shot .
WAYNE: I 'm sorry to hear that -
BLAKE: He chased a gunman down into the sewers . When I pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army . A masked man called 'Bane ' .
WAYNE: Should n't you be telling this to your superior officers ?
BLAKE: I did . One of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there . He needs you . He needs the Batman .
WAYNE: If Commissioner Gordon thinks I 'm the Batman he must be in a bad way
BLAKE: He does n't know or care who you are . But we 've met efore . When I was a kid . At the orphanage . See , my mom died when I was small . Car accident , I do n't eally remember it . But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt . I remember that just fine . Not a lot of people who know what it feels like , do they ? To be angry . In you ones . People understand , foste parents understand . For a while . Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do . To move on . To forget . Wayne stares at Blake .
BLAKE: I do n't know why you took the fall for Dent 's murder , but I 'm still a eliever in the Batman . Even if you 're not .
WAYNE: Why did you say your boys ' home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation ?
BLAKE: Because the money stopped . Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details . Some of those details might need your help .
WAYNE: You checked that name ? 'Bane ' -
ALFRED: Ran it through some databases . He 's a mercenary . No other known name . Never been seen or photographed without a mask . He and his men were ehind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for ou friend John Daggett .
WAYNE: Now Daggett 's brought them here ?
ALFRED: It would seem so . I 'll keep digging .
WAYNE: Why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys ' homes in the city ?
ALFRED: The Foundation is funded from the profits of Wayne Enterprises There have to be some .
WAYNE: Time to talk to Mr. Fox , I think .
ALFRED: I 'll get him on the phone -
WAYNE: No . Do we still have any cars around the place ?
LIGHTS UP: One or two .
WAYNE: And I need an appointment at the hospital . About my leg .
ALFRED: Which hospital , sir ?
WAYNE: Whichever one Jim Gordon 's in .
MIRANDA: I 'm only asking for explanations ecause I think I can help .
FOX: I 'll pass along your request . Next time I see him . Miranda catches something in this .
MIRANDA: He does n't talk to you either ?
FOX: Let 's just say that Bruce Wayne has hiseccentricities .
RISING: Mr. Fox , are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises ?
FOX: I was not . But it would n't do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority .
WAYNE: I see you have n't lost your sense of humoreven if you have lost most of my money .
FOX: Actually , you did that yourself . See , if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball , your company is unlikely to thrive .
WAYNE: Even with -
FOX: A wildly sophisticated CEO , yes . Wayne Enterprises is running out of time . And Daggett is moving in .
WAYNE: What 're my options ?
FOX: If you 're not willing to turn you machine on -
WAYNE: I ca n't , Lucius .
FOX: Then sit tight . Your majority keeps Daggett at arm 's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she 's supported your project all the way . She 's smart , and quite lovely .
WAYNE: You too , Lucius ?
FOX: We all just want what 's best fo you , Bruce . Show her the machine .
WAYNE: I 'll think it over .
FOX: Anything else ?
WAYNE: No , why ?
FOX: These conversations always used to end with someunusual requests .
WAYNE: I retired .
FOX: Let me show you some stuff , anyway .
WAYNE: I figured you 'd have shut this place down .
FOX: It was always shut down , officially .
WAYNE: But all this new stuff ?
FOX: After your father died , Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries . I 've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof . My roof .
WAYNE: Why ?
FOX: Stop them falling into the wrong hands . Besides , I thought someone might get some use out of them Wayne shakes his head .
WAYNE: It 's fine the use it gets these days .
FOX: Well , then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who does n't like to walk
WAYNE: Now you 're just showing off .
FOX: Defense Department project fo tight-geometry urban pacification . Rotors configured for maneuvering etween buildings without ecirculation .
WAYNE: What 's it called ?
FOX: It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation . So I took to calling it the Bat . And yes , Mr. Wayne , it does come in lack . Wayne touches its sleek side . Marveling .
WAYNE: What 's wrong with that ?
FOX: Software-based instability . Take a etter mind than mine to fix it .
WAYNE: Better mind ?
FOX: I was trying to be modest . A less usy mind . Yours , perhaps .
WAYNE: I told you . I retired , Lucius .
DOCTOR: I 've seen worse cartilage in knees
WAYNE: That 's good -
DOCTOR: No , that 's because there is no cartilage in your knee . And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders . Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys , esidual concussive damage to you ain tissue and general scarred-over quality of you ody I can not recommend that you go heli-skiing . About the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver , so if you 're bored I ecommend you take up drinking , Mr. Wayne .
GORDON: We were in this together . Then you were gone
WAYNE: The Batman was n't needed anymore . We won .
GORDON: Built on a lie . Our lie . Now there 's evil rising from where we tried to bury it . Nobody will listen The Batman has to come ack .
WAYNE: What if he does n't exist anymore ?
GORDON: He must . He must .
SELINA: Get out .
YUPPIE: She took my wallet !
SELINA: Now .
JEN: They 're all assholes .
SELINA: Okay , the assholes who hit .
JEN: I do n't know what he 's so upset about , he only had sixty bucks in here .
SELINA: Probably the watch .
YOUNG WOMAN: Watch ?
PAPARAZZI: Another stiff too old to climb out of his sports car .
PAPARAZZI 2: No , that 's Bruce Wayne ! Hey , Wayne , where you been hiding ?
WAYNE: I 'm not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list -
GREETER: Right through here , Mr. Wayne
WAYNE: Miss Tate , is n't it ?
MIRANDA: Even before you became a recluse , you never came to these things
WAYNE: True . Proceeds go to the big fat spread , not the cause . It 's not about charity , it 's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on .
MIRANDA: Actually , this is my party , Mr. Wayne .
WAYNE: Oh .
MIRANDA: And the proceeds will go where they should , because I paid for the big fat spread myself .
WAYNE: That 's very generous of you .
MIRANDA: You have to invest to restore alance to the world . Take ou clean-energy project
WAYNE: Sometimes the investment does n't pay off . Sorry .
MIRANDA: You have a practiced apathy , Mr. Wayne . But a man who does n't care about the world does n't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it And is n't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding Wayne looks at Miranda . Intrigued .
WAYNE: Mind if I cut in ?
SELINA: You were supposed to be a shut-in .
WAYNE: Felt like some fresh air .
SELINA: Why did n't you call the police ?
WAYNE: I have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing . Brazen costume for a cat burglar .
SELINA: Yeah ? Who are you pretending to be ?
WAYNE: Bruce Wayne , eccentric billionaire . Who 's your date ?
SELINA: His wife 's in Ibiza . She left he diamonds behind , though . Worried they 'd get stolen .
WAYNE: It 's pronounced 'Ibeetha ' . You would n't want these folks realizing you 're a crook not a social climber .
SELINA: You think I care what anyone in this room thinks about me ?
WAYNE: I doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you .
SELINA: Do n't condescend , Mr. Wayne . You do n't know a thing about me .
WAYNE: Well , Selina Kyle , I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief . Which means either you 're saving for your retirement - o you 're in deep with the wrong people .
SELINA: You do n't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor .
WAYNE: Actually , I was born in the Regency Room .
SELINA: I started off doing what I had to . Once you 've done what you had to they 'll never let you do what you want to .
WAYNE: Start fresh .
SELINA: There 's no fresh start in today 's world . Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did . Everything we do is collated and quantified . Everything sticks . We are the sum of our mistakes .
WAYNE: Or our achievements .
SELINA: The mistakes stick better . Trust me .
WAYNE: You think that justifies stealing ?
SELINA: I take what I need to from those who have more than enough . I do n't stand on the shoulders of people with less .
WAYNE: Robin Hood ?
SELINA: I 'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room . Than you .
WAYNE: Maybe you 're assuming too much .
SELINA: Or maybe you 're being unrealistic about what 's really in your pants other than your wallet .
WAYNE: Ouch .
SELINA: You think all this can last ? Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party .
WAYNE: Sounds like you 're looking forward to it .
SELINA: I 'm adaptable .
WAYNE: These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe
ANNOYED: You scared her off .
WAYNE: Not likely .
VALET: Your wife said you were taking a cab home , sir .
WAYNE: My wife ?
ALFRED: Just you , sir ? Wayne gives him a withering glare .
WAYNE: Remember those 'unusual requests ' I used to make ?
ALFRED: You 've got the wrong leg , sir .
WAYNE: You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns .
ALFRED: It is terribly painful ?
GRITTED TEETH: You 're welcome to try it , Alfred .
ALFRED: Happy watching , thank you , sir .
WAYNE: Not bad -
ALFRED: Master Wayne , if you 're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane .
WAYNE: I 'm all ears .
ALFRED: There is a prison . In a more ancient part of the world . A pit . Where men are thrown to suffer and die . But sometimes , a man rises from the darkness . Sometimesthe pit sends something back .
WAYNE: Bane .
ALFRED: Born and raised in a hell on earth .
WAYNE: Born in a prison ?
ALFRED: No one knows why . Or how he escaped . But they know who trained him one he didR¯ 's al Gh¯l . You
A U: mentor . Wayne takes this in . Shocked .
ALFRED: He plucked Bane from a dark corne of the earth and trained him in the lackest disciplines of combat , deception and endurance . Just like you .
WAYNE: Bane was a member of the League of Shadows .
ALFRED: Until he was excommunicated . And a man considered too extreme for R¯ 's
WAYNE: I did n't realize I was known fo trifling with criminals .
ALFRED: That was then . And you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on . But it wo n't make you what you were .
WAYNE: Which was ?
ALFRED: Someone whose anger at death made him value all life . Even his own .
WAYNE: If this man is all the things you say he is , then this city needs me . The Batsuit emerges from the cube .
ALFRED: Yes , this city needs Bruce Wayne . Your resources , you knowledgenot your body . Not you life . That time has passed .
WAYNE: I tried helping as Bruce Wayne , Alfred . And I failed .
ALFRED: You can fail as Bruce Wayne . As Batman , you ca n't afford to .
WAYNE: That 's what you 're afraid of - that if I go back out there I 'll fail .
ALFRED: No . I 'm afraid that you want to .
TRADER 2: You ca n't short the stock because Bruce Wayne goes to a party -
TRADER 1: Wayne coming back is change . Change is either good or bad .
TRADER 2: On what basis ?
TRADER 1: I flipped a coin .
TRADER 3: No . Rye . I told 'em rye . Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen . Alright , I 'll take it .
TRADER 1: This is a stock exchange , there 's no money you can steal - He dries up as Bane stops . Turns to him
BANE: Why else would you people be here ?
BLAKE: Move it , now ! We 've got a situation .
CONSTRUCTION WORKER: Where can I move it ? !
BLAKE: That way !
SECURITY CHIEF: You 've got ta get in there !
FOLEY: This is a hostage situation -
SECURITY CHIEF: It 's a robbery ! They 've got direct access to the online trading desk .
FOLEY: I 'm not risking my men for you
SECURITY CHIEF: It 's not our money , it 's everyone 's !
ALLEN: Really ? Mine 's in my mattress .
SECURITY CHIEF: If you do n't shut these guys down , the stuffing in that mattress might e worth a whole lot less , pal .
FOLEY: Cut the fiber line - shut down the cell tower . That 'll slow them down .
SHOESHINE MAN: They cut the fiber . Cell 's working .
BANE: For now . How much longer does the program need ?
SHOESHINE MAN: Eight minutes .
BANE: Time to go mobile .
ALLEN: Get the barriers up - no more in and out on this street !
SNIPER: I 've got something -
ROOKIE COP: Shoot the tires !
VETERAN COP: No shot !
FOLEY: Back off , back off ! They 've got hostages !
ROOKIE COP: What 's going on with the lights ?
VETERAN COP: It ca n't be
ROOKIE COP: The hell was that ? !
VETERAN COP: Oh boy . You 're in for a show tonight , son .
FOLEY: Let 's roll , they 've spotted the Batman !
BLAKE: What 's that ?
FOLEY: I 'm gon na take down the Batman .
BLAKE: Sir , what about the armed robbers ? Foley ignores him .
OVER RADIO: Should we pursue ?
FOLEY: Negative ! Stay on the Batman !
BLAKE: But he 's getting away !
ANNOYED: Who do you want to catch ? Some obber , or the son-of-a-bitch who killed Harvey Dent ?
TV ANNOUNCER: People are n't saying much - frankly , they 're too busy - but all signs suggest that what we 're
CATWOMAN: Well , what do you know ?
DAGGETT: After eight years he has to pick tonight
STRYVER: He 's drawing the cops off Bane Daggett watches , intrigued .
FOLEY: How did you let him go ? !
OVER RADIO: He 's got a lot of firepower -
FOLEY: And you do n't ? ! We 're not letting one nut with a bad attitude and some fancy gadgets run this town down , you hear me ? !
OVER RADIO: He 's heading back downtown
EXCITED: Then he 's as dumb as he dresses - close it down , gentlemen !
FOLEY: Like a rat in a trap , gentlemen
VETERAN COP: You might have the wrong animal there , sir -
BLAKE: Are you sure that was him ?
ON TV: Police are keeping quiet about the prospect of a return by the Batman , ut eyewitness accounts seem the clearly suggests the type of
STRYVER: Bane says the Batman interfered , ut the task was accomplished .
DAGGETT: What about the men they arrested ?
STRYVER: He says , and I quote , they would die before talking .
GRINS: Where does he find these guys ?
DAGGETT: And can we get some girls in here ?
CATWOMAN: Cat got your tongue ? She plucks the gun from his trembling hand .
DAGGETT: You dumb bitch .
CATWOMAN: Nobody ever accused me of being dumb .
DAGGETT: Dumb to show up here tonight .
CATWOMAN: I want what you owe me - Click - Stryver has a gun to her head .
DAGGETT: ' I want ' never gets
STRYVER: Nice outfitthose heels make it tough to walk ?
CATWOMAN: I do n't know , do they ?
DAGGETT: Where 's what ?
CATWOMAN: The program . The 'Clean Slate ' .
DAGGETT: Oh , yeah - the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record . I do n't have it .
CATWOMAN: Where is it ?
DAGGETT: The 'Clean Slate ' ? Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database ? Little too good to be true .
CATWOMAN: You 're lying . Rykin Data took it to prototype stage -
DAGGETT: That 's why I bought them . But they had nothing . It was a gangland myth .
CATWOMAN: Stay back !
BATMAN: They just do n't care .
CATWOMAN: You 've got to be kidding .
BATMAN: No guns . No killing .
CATWOMAN: Where 's the fun in that ?
BATMAN: Come on !
CATWOMAN: My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men -
BATMAN: This is n't a car .
CATWOMAN: See you around - Batman steps down after her .
BATMAN: You 're welcome .
CATWOMAN: I had it under control .
BATMAN: Those were n't street thugs - they were trained killers . I saved you life . In return I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne 's fingerprints . Catwoman looks at him . Considering .
CATWOMAN: Wayne was n't kidding about a 'powerful friend ' . I sold his prints to Daggett . For something that does n't even exist .
BATMAN: I doubt many people get the bette of you .
CATWOMAN: Hey , when a girl 's desperate
BATMAN: What were they going to do with them ?
CATWOMAN: I do n't know . But Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market .
BATMAN: Miss Kyle - ? But she is gone . So that 's what that feels like .
ALFRED: Very inconspicuous . Shall I tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf-blower ?
WAYNE: We bought all the neighbors .
ALFRED: From the look of the television coverage , you seem to have you taste for wanton destruction back .
WAYNE: I retrieved this .
ALFRED: Should n't the police be gathering the evidence ?
WAYNE: They do n't have the tools to analyze it .
ALFRED: They would if you gave them to them
WAYNE: One man 's tool is another man 's weapon .
ALFRED: In your mind , perhaps . But there are n't many things you could n't turn into a weapon .
WAYNE: Alfred . Enough . The police were n't getting it done -
ALFRED: Perhaps they would 've if you have n't made a sideshow of yourself .
WAYNE: Perhaps you 're upset you were wrong .
ALFRED: Wrong ?
WAYNE: You thought I did n't have it in me .
ALFRED: You do n't . You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox . What about when you come up against him . What then ?
WAYNE: I 'll fight harder , I always have .
ALFRED: When you had something to fight for . What are you fighting for now ? Not your life .
WAYNE: You said he was excommunicated .
ALFRED: By R¯ 's al Gh¯l . Who leads them
A U: now ?
WAYNE: R¯ 's al Gh¯l was the League of
A U: Shadows . And I beat him . Bane 's just a mercenary , and we have to find out what he 's up to .
WAYNE: Trades of some kind . Coded The screen blanks , a thumb print appears .
ALFRED: Is that - ?
WAYNE: Mine . Courtesy of Selina Kyle . Wayne pulls out the USB , rises . Get this to Fox - he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing . Alfred looks at Wayne . Takes the USB .
ALFRED: I 'll get this to Fox . But no more . Wayne hears his tone of voice . Turns to him .
WAYNE: You 'd abandon me ?
ALFRED: You see only one end to your story . Leaving is all I have to make you understand you are n't Batman anymore - you have to find anothe way . You used to talk about finishing . About life beyond that awful cave -
WAYNE: Rachel died knowing we 'd decided to e together . That was my life eyond this cave and I ca n't just move on . She did n't . She could n't . Alfred considers this . Looks away .
ALFRED: What if he had ? What if she was n't intending to make a life with you ?
WAYNE: She was , I ca n't change that -
ALFRED: What if , before she died , she 'd written a letter ? Explaining that she 'd chosen Harvey Dent over you ?
WAYNE: Why would you say such a thing ?
ALFRED: Because I have to make you understand .
WAYNE: You 're lying .
ALFRED: Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and I swore to them that I would protect you and I have n't .
WAYNE: You 're lying !
ALFRED: I 've never lied to you . Except when I burned Rachel 's letter . Wayne turns on the old man , furious .
WAYNE: How dare you use Rachel to stop me !
ALFRED: I 'm using the truth , Master Wayne . Maybe it 's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day . I 'm sorry .
WAYNE: Sorry ? ! You expect to destroy my world , then shake hands ? !
ALFRED: No . I know what this means -
WAYNE: What does it mean , Alfred ? !
ALFRED: It means your hatred . It means losing the person I 've cared fo ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house . But it might also mean saving your life . And that is more important .
WAYNE: Goodbye , Alfred .
QUIET: Goodbye , Bruce .
WAYNE: Alfred ? But Alfred is gone .
FOX: Answering your own door ?
WAYNE: Yes . Could you decode the trades on that drive ?
FOX: I did n't need to . Page three . Wayne turns the page
WAYNE: The weapons - we ca n't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences -
FOX: Applied Sciences is shut up tight , and off the books . The energy project is a different story .
WAYNE: Miranda Tate . We need to convince the board to get behind her . Let 's show her the reactor -
FOX: We 're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes . You better get dressed .
MIRANDA: You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump , Mr. Fox ?
FOX: Bear with me , Miss Tate . They arrive at a Portakabin and enter .
MIRANDA: This is it , is n't it ?
FOX: The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach .
MIRANDA: Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid ?
FOX: I 'm gon na plead the fifth on that one .
WAYNE: I thought you might like to see what your investment built .
MIRANDA: No radiation , no fossil fuels . Free , clean energy for an entire city .
WAYNE: If it worked . It does n't .
MIRANDA: You 've built a lot of security around a damp squib . Nothing . About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions . One week later your reactor started developing problems I think this machine works .
WAYNE: Miranda , if it were operational , the danger to Gotham would be too great .
MIRANDA: Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago ?
WAYNE: Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did . Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon . I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor .
MIRANDA: And to do what with it ?
WAYNE: Nothing . Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety .
MIRANDA: And if we ca n't ?
WAYNE: Decommission it . Flood it .
MIRANDA: Destroy the world 's best chance fo a sustainable future ?
WAYNE: If the world 's not ready . Yes .
MIRANDA: Bruce , if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it .
WAYNE: I 'm trusting you .
MIRANDA: Does n't count . You have no choice .
WAYNE: I could 've flooded this chamber any time in the last three years . I 'm choosing to trust you , Miranda , and that 's not the easiest thing fo me . Please . His eyes are genuine . Pleading . Miranda nods .
FOX: We have a board meeting to get to .
DAGGETT: I 'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here . Highly irregular , even if it is his family name above the door
FREDERICKS: Bruce Wayne 's family built this
DAGGETT: Into the ground , sir . Anybody disagree ? Check the value of you shares this morning . Gambling on crazy futures did n't just lose Mr. Wayne his seat , it 's lost us all a lot of money . He needs to leave .
FOX: I 'm afraid he has a point , Mr. Wayne .
WAYNE: I understand . Ladies and gentlemen .
DAGGETT: Let 's get down to business .
FOX: Right away .
REPORTER: Wayne , how 's it feel to be one of the people ? !
COMPANY VALET: I 'm sorry , sir , they had paperwork
DAGGETT: How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne oard ? ! Was she meeting with Wayne ? Was she sleeping with Wayne ?
STRYVER: Not that we know of -
DAGGETT: Clearly you do n't 'know of ' anything , do you ? ! Where 's Bane ? !
STRYVER: We told him it was urgent -
DAGGETT: Then where is the masked -
BANE: and he shall appear .
DAGGETT: What the hell 's going on ?
BANE: The plan is proceeding as expected .
DAGGETT: You see me running Wayne Enterprises ? ! Your stock exchange hit did n't work , friend . And now you 've got my construction crews working all hours around the city ? How 's that supposed to help my company abso Wayne 's ?
TO STRYVER: Leave us .
DAGGETT: You stay right there ! I 'm in charge !
BANE: Do you feel in charge ? Daggett is taken aback . Stryver leaves .
DAGGETT: I 've paid you a small fortune -
BANE: And that gives you power over me ?
DAGGETT: What is this ?
BANE: Your money and infrastructure have een important . Till now .
DAGGETT: What are you ?
BANE: Gotham 's reckoning . Come to end the orrowed time you 've all been living on
DAGGETT: You are true evil
BANE: I am necessary evil .
BLAKE: When you beganwhy the mask ?
WAYNE: To protect the people closest to me .
BLAKE: You 're a loner with no family .
WAYNE: There are always people you care about . You just do n't realize how much until they 're gone . The idea was to be a symbol . Batman could be anybody , that was the point .
BLAKE: It was damn good to see him back .
WAYNE: Not everybody agrees .
BLAKE: They 'll figure it out in the end .
WAYNE: Got anything on Bane 's whereabouts ?
BLAKE: Yeah , I 've got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight . I could use some help .
THINKS: You know what ? Drop me in Old Town
WAYNE: Do n't wait . I 'll get a cab .
BLAKE: You got money ?
WAYNE: Actually , no .
SELINA: He 's not a mark . Jen looks at Selina . At Wayne .
WAYNE: Actually , they 're letting me keep the house .
SHAKES HEAD: The rich do n't even go broke same as the rest of us , huh ?
WAYNE: Vacation ?
SELINA: Let 's just say that I 've incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you .
WAYNE: My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving .
SELINA: And how would he do that ?
WAYNE: By giving you what you want .
SELINA: It does n't exist .
WAYNE: He says it does . He wants to meet . Tonight .
SELINA: Why ?
WAYNE: He needs to find Bane . He thinks you 'd know how .
SELINA: Tell him I 'll think about it . Wayne nods , starts to leave .
WAYNE: No , you 're not .
FOLEY: Can we help you , officer ?
BLAKE: John Daggett 's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago . I thought you might like to know .
GORDON: Why ?
BLAKE: Because Daggett 's name is all ove the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham .
TO FOLEY: Where did you get to with the tunnel searches ?
TO BLAKE: Remind me to tell the detail to keep hotheads out . We 've had teams down there , but it 's a huge network -
GORDON: Get more men , work a grid . I want him found .
FOLEY: Yeah , yeah - the masked man . We 're on it .
GORDON: This is good work . Lose the uniform - you 're working for me now . We could use some hotter heads around here .
BLAKE: This could just be a coincidence .
GORDON: You 're a detective now , son , you 're not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore .
WAYNE: No . I 'm on my own now .
MIRANDA: Do you have keys ?
WAYNE: Never needed them She takes his hand .
MIRANDA: Let 's find a window .
WAYNE: Hope you do n't like me for you money .
MIRANDA: Suffering builds character . Then at a photo of Wayne 's parents .
WAYNE: He left . Taking everything .
MIRANDA: What 's that ?
SHEEPISH: I think my power 's been shut off .
WAYNE: You 're pretty good at that .
MIRANDA: When I was a child we had almost nothing . But on the nights we had a fire , we felt very rich indeed .
WAYNE: I assumed your family was wealthy .
MIRANDA: Not always . Not when I was young . He traces a scar on her shoulder .
WAYNE: I 've made a few myself .
MIRANDA: More than a few We could leave . Tonight . Take my plane . Go anywhere we wanted .
WAYNE: Someday perhaps . Not tonight .
CATWOMAN: Do n't be shy . Batman is there .
BATMAN: That depends .
CATWOMAN: On what ?
BATMAN: On what you want it for . I acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands .
CATWOMAN: Still do n't trust me , huh ? How can we change that ?
BATMAN: Start by taking me to Bane .
SHRUGS: You asked .
CATWOMAN: From here , Bane 's men patrol the tunnelsand they are not you average brawlers .
BATMAN: Neither am I. Catwoman swings into a -
CATWOMAN: He 's behind you .
SPINS: Who ? Batman hangs upside down behind him .
CATWOMAN: Just a little further .
BATMAN: You 've made a serious mistake .
BANE: Let 's not stand on ceremony here , Mr. Wayne .
BATMAN: Us ? You were excommunicated . From a gang of psychopaths .
BANE: Now I am the League of Shadows , here to fulfill R¯ 's al Gh¯l 's
A U: destiny
BANE: You fight like a younger man . Nothing held back . No reserves . Admirable . But mistaken .
BATMAN: No
BANE: Your precious armory . Gratefully accepted . We will need it .
UNIFORM: Excuse me , Miss . I need to see you ticket and identification , please . Selina , surprised , fumbles with her purse .
SELINA: Would you mind ?
BLAKE: I showed your picture to the Congressman and guess what ?
SELINA: Do n't tell me , still in love ?
BLAKE: Head over heels . Pressing charges , though . Blake lays a police file down with a thump . You 've made some mistakes , Ms. Kyle .
SELINA: Girl 's gon na eat .
BLAKE: You have an appetite . Why run ? You ca n't hide from us with this ecord .
SELINA: Maybe it 's not you I 'm running from .
BLAKE: Who then ? Bane ? What do you know about him ?
QUIET: That you should be as afraid of him as I am .
BLAKE: We can offer you protection
SELINA: I 'm not sure . And we -
WAYNE: Why did n't you just kill me ?
BANE: You do n't fear death . You welcome it . Your punishment is to be more severe .
SCATHING: You 're a torturer
BANE: Yes . But not of your body . Of you soul .
WAYNE: Where am I ?
BANE: Home .
GUARD: We 're locking her up in here ?
WARDEN: The Dent Act allows non-segregation ased on extraordinary need . First time she broke out of women 's correctional she was sixteen .
HUGE INMATE: Little closer , baby
SELINA: Why , honey , you wan na hold my hand ?
WARDEN: She 'll be just fine .
FOX: I do n't see the need for a board meeting on the energy project -
MIRANDA: Bruce got a lot of things right . Keeping the board in the dark was n't one of them Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open
BANE: This meeting is called to order . Fox and Miranda freeze . Staring at the mask .
FREDERICKS: No . I volunteer .
FOX: Where are you taking us ?
BANE: Where you buried your resources . The bowels of Gotham .
GORDON: So you think our friend is gone again ?
GRAVE: This timehe might not be coming ack .
FOLEY: Okay , Commissioner , you were right .
GORDON: What 's happened ?
FOLEY: Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board . He let most of them go , but took three down into the sewers .
GORDON: No more patrols , no more hide and seek . Send every available cop down there to smoke him out .
FOLEY: The Mayor wo n't want panic -
BLAKE: So it 's a training exercise . Foley looks at Gordon .
FOLEY: I 'm sorry for not taking you
GORDON: Do n't apologize for believing the world 's in better shape then it isjust fight to make it true . Foley nods . Leaves . Blake gets up .
PRISONER: He asks if you would pay us to let you die . I told him you have nothing .
WAYNE: Do it for the pleasure . The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne 's lips .
PRISONER: They pay me more than that to keep you alive .
WAYNE: Has anyone made it ?
PRISONER: Of course not . The Blind Prisoner barks at him .
WAYNE: What does he say ?
PRISONER: He says there is one who did . A child
WAYNE: Bane .
PRISONER: An old legend . Nothing more .
WAYNE: Do n't .
PRISONER: Whatever they want you to seeit 's happening soon .
BANE: Turn it on .
FOX: I wo n't do it . Fredericks trembles . Bane cocks the weapon .
MIRANDA: Alright , stop .
BANE: Do your work .
REPORTER: We 're seeing literally thousands of police heading into the sewers -
MAYOR: A training exercise , that 's all . If you 'll excuse me , I 've got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid City .
BLAKE: I 've been to half Daggett 's cement plants , logged locations they 've poured for underground construction
GORDON: But you know about patterns . Keep looking . Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant .
DR. PAVEL: It 's done . This is now a four-megaton nuclear bomb .
BANE: Pull the core out of the reactor .
HORRIFIED: You ca n't . This is the only powe source capable of sustaning it - if you move it , the core will decay in a matter of months .
BANE: Five , by my calculations .
DR. PAVEL: And then it will go off .
BANE: For the sake of your family , Dr. Pavel , I hope so .
WORKER: Boss is about to leave .
BLAKE: Hey . The Driver turns .
DRIVER: When ?
BLAKE: When ? When half the city 's cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck shut them out .
DRIVER: Oh yeah . You 're that cop -
BLAKE: Detective , now .
OVER RADIO: Foley 's overseeing the operation -
BLAKE: They 're heading into a trap !
FOLEY: Foley .
BLAKE: It 's a trap ! Pull everyone out ! Bane 's been pouring concrete laced with explosives -
FOLEY: Where ?
BLAKE: There 's a ring around the tunnels - they 're gon na blow it and trap the cops underground !
FOLEY: Pull out ! Pull 'em out !
BANE: Let the games begin . The Mercenaries hit the detonators .
BLAKE: Foley ?
OVER RADIO: Jesus , Blake ! Every cop in the city 's down in those tunnels !
REALIZES: Not every cop
GORDON: Get my coat , son .
BANE: This is the instrument of you liberation
ANALYST: Satellite shows a radiation spike
ANALYST 2: Whatever it isit 's nuclear .
BANE: Identify yourself to the world .
DR. PAVEL: Dr. Leonid Pavel , nuclea physicist . Bane turns Dr. Pavel 's head for the cameras .
CIA ANALYST: Pavel was confirmed dead - plane crash on an Agency pull-out of Uzbekistan But it certainly looks like him -
BANE: Tell the world what this is .
DR. PAVEL: A fully primed neutron bomb . With a last radius of six miles .
BANE: And who can disarm this device ?
DR. PAVEL: Only me .
BANE: Thank you , Doctor .
GENERAL: Pull back the fighters , start high-level reconnaissance flights . And get the President on the line .
LEAD MERCENARY: Tanks and planes can not stop us detonating our device . Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication .
CAPTAIN: How many of you are there , son ? You do n't have enough men to stop twelve million people leaving that island .
LEAD MERCENARY: We do n't . But you do .
CAPTAIN: Why in the hell would we help you keep your hostages ?
LEAD MERCENARY: If people start crossing this idge Gotham gets blown to hell . The Captain considers this . Troubled .
OVER RADIO: The people of our greatest city are esilient . They have proven this efore , they will prove this again
OVER TV: We do not negotiate with terrorists , but we do recognize ealities Wayne starts to cry .
OVER RADIO: As the situation develops , one thing must be understood above all others People of Gotham , we have not abandoned you .
BLAKE: What does that mean ?
GORDON: It means we 're on our own . I have to get in front of a camera -
BLAKE: Sir , they 'll kill you the second you show your face -
GORDON: The Mayor 's dead . I 'm the symbol of law and order . Bane says he 's giving Gotham back to the people - they need to know that I could lead .
BLAKE: Bane 's not gon na let that happen -
GORDON: Then he 'll show his true colors .
BLAKE: And you 'll be dead . Gordon says nothing .
BANE: Behind you stands a symbol of oppression . Blackgate Prison
BLAKE: We 're gon na keep moving you , till we can get you in front of a camera
BANE: But they supplied you a false idol . A straw man . To placate . To stop you tearing down this corrupt city
BANE: 'The things we did in Harvey 's name ought desperately needed security to our streets But I can no longer live with my lie . It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth , and it is time for me to esign . '
BLAKE: These men , locked up in Blackgate for eight years , denied parole under the Dent Act . Based on a lie .
GORDON: A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground . Gotham needed a hero , someone to believe in -
BLAKE: Not as much as it does now . But you etrayed everything you stood for .
GORDON: There 's a point . Far out there . When the structures fail you . When the rules are n't weapons anymore , they 're shackles , letting the bad get ahead . Maybe one day you 'll have such a moment of crisis . And in that moment , I hope you have a friend like I did . To plunge thei hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean .
BLAKE: Your hands look pretty filthy to me , Commissioner .
BANE: We take Gotham from the corrupt . The rich . The oppressors of generations who 've kept you down with the myth of opportunity . And we give it to you , the people . Gotham is yours - none shall interfere . Do as you please The Tumbler fires , blowing the doors to hell .
PRISONER: He says you must first straighten your back .
WAYNE: How would he know ?
PRISONER: He was the prison doctor . A morphine addict who incurred the displeasure of powerful people . Including your masked friend .
WAYNE: How ?
PRISONER: Many years ago , during a time of plague , Bane was attacked by othe prisoners . The doctor 's fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony . The mask holds his pain at bay .
WAYNE: Is Bane the child you spoke of ? Was he born here ?
PRISONER: The legend is that there was a mercenary working for the local warlord who fell in love with his daughter . They married in secret .
WAYNE: How - ?
PRISONER: You stay like this . Until you stand .
A U: Did you not think I 'd return , Bruce ?
WAYNE: I watched you die .
A U: There are many forms of immortality . Wayne looks inward , remembering
A U: Once I had a wife . My great love . She was taken from me
WAYNE: You were the mercenary . Bane is your child . Your heir .
A U: An heir to ensure the League of Shadows fulfills its duty to estore balance to civilization .
WAYNE: No
A U: You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years . With all you strength and resources , all you moral authority . And the only victory you could achieve was a lie . Finally you understand Gotham is beyond saving
A U: And must be allowed to die . CUT TO WHITE . And we are -
BLAKE: For the bus in case there 's a chance to evacuate . Keep it in here - people are siphoning parked cars .
FATHER REILLY: Really ?
GRINS: How do you think I got it ?
FATHER REILLY: Right . Any news ? Is the
BLAKE: Less you know , Father . How 're the oys ?
FATHER REILLY: Power 's been on more , so they get some TV . Blake smiles . Moves to the door . Blake , you be careful out there . They 're hunting down cops like dogs . Blake nods . Leaves .
JEN: Who 's that ?
SELINA: This was someone 's home .
JEN: Now it 's everyone 's home . Selina stares out at a Tumbler rolling by .
SELINA: No . It 's what I thought I wanted .
PRISONER: Why build yourself ?
WAYNE: I 'm not meant to die in here . The Prisoner indicates the TV
PRISONER: Here ? There ? What 's the difference ? Wayne ignores this . Focuses on his body
WAYNE: You told me a child did it
PRISONER: No ordinary child
FOLEY: You have ID ?
GORDON: Captain , glad to have you here .
CAPTAIN JONES: How many of you are there ?
GORDON: Dozens . I 'd rather not say exactly . But the men trapped underground number almost three thousand .
CAPTAIN JONES: What kind of shape they 're in ?
GORDON: They 've been getting water , food .
CAPTAIN JONES: Could we break them out ?
BLAKE: Yes , sir - take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park , blow the rubble , you 've got a hole big enough fo ten at a time . I 'm in contact with my partner - they 're waiting fo the day .
CAPTAIN JONES: What about the bomb ? The satellites ca n't see any radiation hot spots
GORDON: No leads . It 's a bluff - Bane would n't give control of that bom to someone else .
CAPTAIN JONES: We ca n't take that chance . Until we have the triggerman , we just track the device , smuggle men over -
BLAKE: While Gotham lives under a warlord , like in some failed state ?
CAPTAIN JONES: Dial it back , officer . This situation is unprecedented . We ca n't do anything to risk millions of lives .
TO GORDON: Are n't you gon na tell him ? !
GORDON: Captain , things are more complicated than you think . There 's somebody you need to meet . Blake ?
BLAKE: I was up here looking for a vantage point . Found the people who run the corporation who owns it living here .
CAPTAIN JONES: Which corporation ?
BLAKE: Captain , meet Mr. Fox . Mr. Fox , I 'd like you to brief the Captain . Captain Jones indicates Miranda .
FOX: Miss Tate is fully aware of the situation .
MIRANDA: And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises , I have to take responsibility for it .
CAPTAIN JONES: Why ?
MIRANDA: Because , Captain , we built it .
CAPTAIN JONES: You built the bomb ?
FOX: It was built as a fusion reactor . The first of its kind . Bane turned the core into a bomb , then disconnected it from the reactor .
BLAKE: And here 's the important part .
FOX: As the device 's fuel cells decay , it 's becoming increasingly unstableuntil the point of detonation .
BLAKE: The bomb 's a time bomb .
FOX: And it will go off . In twenty-three days . Captain Jones reels at this news .
BLAKE: Bane 's revolution is a sham . He 's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship 's going down . Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought .
CAPTAIN JONES: Could you disarm it ?
FOX: I do n't know , But I could reconnect it to the reactor . Stabilize it .
CAPTAIN JONES: We 'd have to let the Pentagon know .
BLAKE: Fox , somebody sold us out ! Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor .
FOX: Take Miranda -
CAPTAIN JONES: I 'll die before I talk
BANE: I 'm on your schedule , Captain .
MERCERNARY: There were people living upstairs . Bane looks up , disinterested . Jones is dead .
BANE: Give them over for judgement . Hang them where the world will see .
PRISONER: He says the leap to freedom is not about strength .
WAYNE: My body makes the jump .
CRACKED ENGLISH: Survival is the spirit . The soul .
WAYNE: My soul 's as ready to escape as my ody .
BLIND PRISONER: Fear is why you fail .
WAYNE: I 'm not afraid . I 'm angry . Wayne throws punchesfocused .
SKINNY PRISONER: Should n't you get him down ? The Prisoner glances up at Wayne , disdainful .
PRISONER: He 'll keep . As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we -
CRACKED ENGLISH: You do not fear death . You think this makes you strong . This makes you weak .
WAYNE: Why ?
BLIND PRISONER: How can you move faster then possible ? Fight longer than possible ? If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit . The fear of death . The will to survive .
WAYNE: I do fear death . I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it .
BLIND PRISONER: Then make the climb .
WAYNE: How ?
BLIND PRISONER: As the child did . Without the rope . Then fear will find you again . Wayne considers this .
PRISONER: Supplies for your journey ?
STRYVER: I want to see Bane ! There 's been a mistake ! Take me to Bane ! Fox watches him dragged upstairs
CRANE: You are Philip Stryver , executive vice-president of Daggett Industries ? The same Philip Stryver who fo years lived like a prince off the lood and sweat of people less powerful ?
STRYVER: Call Bane ! I 'm one of you !
CRANE: Bane has no authority here . This is merely a sentencing hearing . The choice is yours , death or exile .
STRYVER: Exile .
SMASHES GAVEL: Soldto the man in the cold sweat ! Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock
BLACKGATE INMATE: Follow the tick ice . Try to swim - you 're dead in minutes .
STRYVER: Has anyone made it ?
GORDON: Where the hell are they ? It 's not like we have a lot of time , here .
COP: How long ?
GORDON: The bomb goes off tomorrow . We 've got about eighteen hours to do something .
COP: To do what ?
GORDON: We mark that truck . Get a GPS on it , then we can start thinking about how to take it down .
LOW: That 's it ?
GORDON: Foley . Where 's Foley , dammit ? ! Gordon heads for the door .
BLAKE: You should n't be out on the streets
FOLEY'S WIFE: Jim . He 's not here -
GORDON: You 're sending your wife to the door when the city 's unde occupation ? !
FOLEY: Wait in the kitchen , honey .
GORDON: What did you do , bury your uniform in the backyard ?
FOLEY: Jim , you saw what they did to those Special Forces .
GORDON: You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbange wanting to plant one as soon as ou acks were turned ?
FOLEY: This is different and you know it . These guys run the city - the government 's done a deal with them
GORDON: Deal ? ! Bane 's got their balls in a vice . That 's not a deal -
FOLEY: You move against Bane , the triggerman 's gon na hit the button -
GORDON: You think he 's given control of that bomb to one of 'the people ' ? ! You think this is part of some evolution ? There 's one man with his finger on the button - Bane .
FOLEY: We have to keep our heads down until they can fix this . If you still had family here maybe you 'd -
GORDON: This only gets fixed from inside the city , Foley . Look , I 'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues . But we 've got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell .
FOLEY: I 'm sorry Jim . I got ta -
GORDON: Keep your head down ? What 's that gon na do tomorrow , when that thing lows ?
FOLEY: You do n't know that 's going to happen .
MIRANDA: How about me , instead ?
GORDON: Miss Tate , I ca n't ask you -
MIRANDA: My company built it .
GORDON: Bruce Wayne built it .
MIRANDA: And he wanted to destroy it . It was me who did n't listen . Please . Gordon looks at Blake . Then Miranda . Nods .
GORDON: Let 's go .
GANGBANGER: You steal from us , you little astard ?
SELINA: You boys know you ca n't come into my neighborhood without asking politely .
KID: Now you 're gon na take it .
SELINA: Just tax .
WAYNE: Not yet .
SELINA: If you 're expecting an apology -
WAYNE: It would n't suit you . I need you help .
SELINA: And why would I help you ? Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket .
WAYNE: For this . The 'Clean Slate ' .
SELINA: You 're gon na trust me with that ? After what I did to you ?
WAYNE: I admit I felt a little let down . But I still think there 's more to you . In fact , I think for you - this is n't a tool , it 's an escape route . You want to disappear . Start fresh .
SELINA: Start fresh ? I ca n't even get off this island .
WAYNE: I can give you a way off . Once you 've gotten me to Lucius Fox . I need you to find out where they 're holding him . Then take me in .
SELINA: Why do you need Fox ?
WAYNE: To save this city .
SELINA: Who says it needs saving ? Maybe I like it this way .
WAYNE: Maybe you do . But tomorrow that omb 's going off .
SELINA: Get your powerful friend on the case .
WAYNE: I 'm trying . But I need Fox .
GORDON: Stay further up the block . They 're gon na cross the street and try and slow the truck down . As it approaches , hit this utton . If the needle hits two hundred - give me the signal and I mark the truck . Okay ?
OVER RADIO: Heads up .
GORDON: Got it .
MERCENARY: Commissioner Gordon , you 're unde arrest .
GORDON: On whose authority ?
MERCERNARY: The people of Gotham .
MIRANDA: Bruce ?
FOX: You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation , Mr. Wayne .
WAYNE: How long until the core ignites ?
FOX: That bomb goes off in twelve hours .
WAYNE: Unless we can connect it to the eactor .
FOX: If you can get it there . I 'll find a way to plug it back in . Can you get Miranda out ?
WAYNE: Not tonight . I 'm sorry .
MIRANDA: Do what 's necessary .
TO FOX: Tonight I need you .
FOX: What for ?
WAYNE: To get me back in the game .
CATWOMAN: Sorry to spoil things , boys , but Bane wants these guys himself
WAYNE: I wo n't forget about you .
MIRANDA: I know .
FOX: I like your girlfriend , Mr. Wayne .
CATWOMAN: He should be so lucky .
WAYNE: Any move I make against Bane or the omb - the triggerman sets it off .
FOX: They ca n't be using radio or cell - too much interference . Infrared does n't have the range . It could only be micro-burst long wave
WAYNE: Could you block it ?
FOX: Yes . I need the EMP cannon-guidance mount from the Bat . You remembe where you parked ?
CRANE: The charges are espionage and attempted sabotage Do you have anything to say in your defense ?
GORDON: No lawyer , no witnesses . What sort of due process is this ?
CRANE: More than you give Harvey 's prisoners , Commissioner . Your guilt is determined , this is merely a sentencing hearing . What 's it to e , death or exile ?
GORDON: Crane , if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice , you 've got another think coming .
CRANE: Death , then ?
GORDON: Looks that way .
CRANE: Very well Death By exile .
BANE: Bring her to me .
LUCIUS: I think it 's time to talk about my year-end bonus
FOX: She fly pretty well ?
WAYNE: Even without the autopilot
FOX: Autopilot ? That 's what you 're there for .
FOLEY'S KIDS: Dad ! Check it out !
FOLEY'S WIFE: Honey , take a look !
MERCENARY: Sir ? Bane turns . The Mercenary points at the sign .
BANE: Impossible
BATMAN: This blocks the remote detonato signal to the bomb . Get it onto the truck by sunrise . They might hit the button when it starts .
GORDON: When what starts ?
BATMAN: War .
BLAKE: You missed a spot .
BATMAN: If you 're working alone , wear a mask .
BLAKE: No one cares who I am .
BATMAN: The mask is not for you . It 's to protect the people you care about .
BLAKE: Huh . And you always seem to know where those people are . How is that ?
BATMAN: I lost someone once . Since then I eak into their homes when they 're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck .
BLAKE: No offense , but you got anything igger in that belt ?
BATMAN: That 's to warn the men on the othe side . Batman disappears into the shadows .
BLAKE: But how do we - ?
BATMAN: All-out assault on Banebut you need to get the people you care about across the bridge .
BLAKE: Why ?
BATMAN: In case we fail . Lead an exodus across the bridge . Save as many lives as you can .
BLAKE: Do n't you need me here ?
BATMAN: You 've given me an army . Now go . Blake nods . Turns to leave . Stops .
BLAKE: Thank you .
BATMAN: Do n't thank me yet .
BLAKE: I might not get a chance later . Batman nods . Blake disappears into the night .
CATWOMAN: Oh , you should n't have She hops on , feeling the controls .
BATMAN: The mid-town tunnel 's blocked by debris , but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path fo people . Catwoman marvels at the controls
CATWOMAN: I got it .
BATMAN: We 've got forty-five minutes to save this city -
CATWOMAN: No , I 've got forty-five minutes to get clear of the blast radius , ecause you do n't stand a chance against these guys .
BATMAN: With your help I might . She shakes her head .
CATWOMAN: I 'll open that tunnel , then I 'm gone . He looks at her .
BATMAN: There 's more to you than that .
CATWOMAN: Sorry to keep letting you down . He says nothing . She looks at him , imploring . Come with me . Save yourself . You do n't owe these people anymore - you 've given them everything
BATMAN: Not everything . Not yet .
FOLEY: There 's only one police in this city . He steps forward . The line follows .
BANE: Open fire .
GORDON: Come on , come on
BANE: You came back . To die with you city .
BATMAN: No . I came back to stop you .
GORDON: That 's impossible Come on ! Cut over to Fifth ! They sprint for the next parallel avenue
BLAKE: Knock on doors , spread the word - the bomb 's going to blow ! Get out y the South Street tunnel , or ove the bridge ! Do two blocks , then get ack to the bus !
BANE: Stay back . He is mine -
BATMAN: Give me the trigger ! You 'd neve give it to an ordinary citizen -
BANE: I broke you . How have you come ack ?
BATMAN: You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to escape ?
BANE: I never escaped - R¯ 's al Gh¯l
A U: rescued me . That is why I must fulfill his plan . That is why I must avenge his murder .
CONFUSED: The child of R¯ 's al Gh¯l made the
MIRANDA: I am .
BANE: Goodbye . Then is overrun .
TALIA: I climbed out of the pit
A U: stop . R¯ 's al Gh¯l has found Bane , bandaged .
TALIA: The League took us in . Trained us
TALIA: He saw only a monster who could never be tamed . Whose very existence was a reminder of the hell he 'd left his wife to die in . He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows . His only crime was that he loved me . I could not truly forgive my father Talia looks at Batman , cold . Until you murdered him .
BATMAN: He was trying to kill millions of innocent people -
TALIA: 'Innocent ' is a strong word to throw around Gotham , Bruce . I hono my father by finishing his work . Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward fo my patience Talia twists the knife in Batman 's side . You see , it 's the slow knifethe knife that takes its time , the
BATMAN: Your knife may have been too slow A Mercenary steps forward -
MERCENARY: The truck 's under attack - Talia looks around , mind racing .
TALIA: Gordon . You gave him a way to block my signal . No matter - He 's bought Gotham eleven minutes . Prepare a convoy . We must secure the bomb until it detonates .
BANE: You 'll have to imagine the fire -
CATWOMAN: The whole no-guns thing ? I do n't feel as strongly about it as you do .
UNIFORM: Stay there ! What are you doing ? !
PULLS BADGE: Blake , MCU - I 'm getting these boys to safety -

BLAKE: You idiots ! You sons of bitches ! You 're killing us ! !
FATHER REILLY: But there 's nowhere to go , son .
OVER RADIO: They 're trying to force us onto
TALIA: Pushing us to the entrance of the eactor . They 're going to try and econnect the core .
OVER RADIO: Can they ? Talia smiles .
GORDON: Give me a hand !
TALIA: Fox showed me how to operate the eactor core . Including the emergency flood -
GORDON: What 're you doing ?
BATMAN: Two minutes . I can fly it out ove the bay Catwoman is at his side as he works .
CATWOMAN: Rig it out to fly over the water , then bail -
BATMAN: No autopilot . She takes this in . He stands to face her .
CATWOMAN: You could 've gone anywhere . Been anything . But you came back here .
BATMAN: So did you .
CATWOMAN: I guess we 're both suckers .
GORDON: So this is the part where you vanish , only this time you do n't come back ? Batman opens the canopy .
BLAKE: Come on ! On the bus !
FATHER REILLY: What 're you doing ?
BLAKE: Protection from the blast -
FATHER REILLY: It 's an atom bomb - ! Blake turns on Father Reilly , furious .
BLAKE: You think they need to hear that in their last seconds ? You think I 'm going to let them die without hope ?
GORDON: I never cared who you were -
BATMAN: And you were right .
GORDON: But should n't the people know the hero who saved them ?
BATMAN: A hero can be anyone . That was always the point .
GORDON: Bruce Wayne ?
BLAKE: Heads down ! Heads down , now !
FATHER REILLY: Blake , they need to make thei peace . Blake turns to him , furious .
BLAKE: They 're children ! They have no peace to make -
LITTLE BOY: No . That 's Batman !

TECH 1: Why worry about the stabilization software ? This whole autopilot system 's obsolete -
FOX: Please , I just need to know what I could 've done to fix it .

NARRATOR: It is the mid 22nd Century . Mankind has explored the boundaries of his own solar system , and now he reaches out to the endless interstella distances of the universe . He moves away from his own small planetary system in huge hyperdrive starships computer-driven , self-supporting , closed-system spacecraft that travel at mind-staggering post-light velocities . Man has begun to spread among the stars . Enormous ships embark with generations of colonists searching the depths of space fo new earths , now homes , new eginnings . Far in advance of these colony ships goes a new pioneer the scouts , the pathfinders , a special eed of man who has dedicated his life to blazing the trail through the most distant , unexplored galaxies , opening up the farthest frontiers of space . These are the men of the Advance Exploration Corps . The task they face is one of unbelievable isolation and loneliness . So far from home that Earth is no longer even a point of light in the sky , they must comb the universe for those unstable planets whose existence poses a threat to the peaceful colonists that follow . They must find these rogue planets and destroy them . Among these commandos are the men of the scoutship Dark Star .
DOOLITTLE: Ah , what 'd you say , Pinback ?
PINBACK: Mafhkin oble groop
DOOLITTLE: Ah , what was that again , I still ca n't hear you ?
PINBACK: I said I 'm trying to reach Talby . Something 's wrong with the damn intercom . I need a last-minute diameter approximation .
DOOLITTLE: Talby , Talby , this is Doolittle . Do you read me ? Talby ?
TALBY: Oh ! Ah , yes , Doolittle . What is it ? u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
DOOLITTLE: I need a diameter approximation .
TALBY: Okay , Doolittle , I 'll have it in a minute .
PINBACK: I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction .
DOOLITTLE: I 'll check it .
BOILER: I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand .
PINBACK: Right , that checks out here .
DOOLITTLE: Pinback
PINBACK: Yes , Doolittle .
DOOLITTLE: Your GHF reading is minus fifteen .
PINBACK: Doolittle
DOOLITTLE: Yes .
PINBACK: I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark .
DOOLITTLE: In a second .
PINBACK: Boiler , can you set me up with some temp figures ?
BOILER: Ninety seven million , minus eight , corrected to mass critical .
PINBACK: I read that with a quantum increase of seven .
DOOLITTLE: Pinback , I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven .
BOILER: Time to start talking .
PINBACK: Bomb bay systems operational . Pinback hits a button on his panel . u > INTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u
NARRATOR: This is a chain-reaction bomb , otherwise known as an Exponential Thermostellar Device . Its own destructive power is small , barely enough to vaporize twelve city locks . However , when it explodes in contact with an object the size of a planet , it starts a chain-reaction in the very matter of that planet , turning it into a giant reacto which destroys itself in one staggering thermal flash . These bombs are equipped with sophisticated thought and speech mechanisms , to allow them to make executive decisions in the event of a crisis situation . These judgment centers are controlled by a fail- safe mechanism . u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
DOOLITTLE: Lock fail safe . Pinback turns a key in a lock .
PINBACK: Fail-safe locked . Ah , Sergeant Pinback call1ng Bomb # 19 . Do you ead me , bomb ? u > EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u The bomb is suspended beneath the ship .
BOMB #19: Bomb # 19 to Sergeant Pinback , I read you . Continue .
PINBACK: Well , bomb , we have about sixty seconds to drop . Just wondering if everything is all right . Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding ? u > EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u
BOMB #19: Energy shielding positive function . u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
PINBACK: Swell . Let 's synchronize detonation time . Do you know when you 're supposed to go off ? u > EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u
BOMB #19: Detonation in six minutes , twenty seconds . u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
PINBACK: All right , I have detonation time at Wait a minute , something 's wrong with the clock . All right , I have detonation time at no , that ca n't be right , it says three years . Okay , I have six minutes exactly . Does that check out down there ? u > EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u
BOMB #19: Check at six minutes . u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
PINBACK: Arm yourself , bomb . u > EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u Several lights blip on along the bomb 's side .

DOOLITTLE: Hyperdrive sequence begun . Hit it , Pinback .
TALBY: Lieutenant Doolittle , it just exploded . Ah , sir , the planet just exploded . Lieutenant ? u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u The men are stretching in their seats .
DOOLITTLE: Unlock fail safe . Pinback unlocks the fail-safe unit .
PINBACK: Fail safe unlocked .
RECORDED VOICE: Attention . Attention . The hyperdrive sequence is now terminated . Please observe that the no smoking signs have growrrr The voice runs down .
DOOLITTLE: Well now what ? What do , you have for us now . Boiler ?
BOILER: Not much . Nothing at all in this sector .
DOOLITTLE: Find me something , I do n't care where it is .
BOILER: Well , I show a 95 % probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula
DOOLITTLE: Fuck that shit .
BOILER: Well , it is kind of a long shot
DOOLITTLE: It 's a goddamn wild goose chase . Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud ?
BOILER: Well , there 's the possibility of
DOOLITTLE: Remember what we found ? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp alloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it . Remember ?
BOILER: All right , then
DOOLITTLE: So do n't give me any of that sentient life crap . Find me something I can blow up .
PINBACK: New star . Hey , guess what ? I got a new star on the readout .
DOOLITTLE: Which one ?
PINBACK: Another unknown . Not on the charts . A red dwarf .
DOOLITTLE: Any planets ?
PINBACK: Yeah . Eight , it says here .
DOOLITTLE: Any of 'em any good ?
PINBACK: Naah . All stable . Doolittle loses interest .
DOOLITTLE: What ?
PINBACK: The new star . What are you gon na name it ?
DOOLITTLE: Who cares . Do n't bother me . Pinback 's mouth tightens . A pause .
PINBACK: Commander Powell would have named it .
DOOLITTLE: Commander Powell is dead .
PINBACK: Come on , Doolittle , give it a name .
DOOLITTLE: Fred .
PINBACK: Wha ?
DOOLITTLE: I hereby name this star Fred .
BOILER: Hey , Doolittle , here 's one . An unstable planet . 85 % probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star .
DOOLITTLE: Sounds good . Chart a course for the Veil Nebula .
BOILER: Pinback , throw me the chart log .
DOOLITTLE: Let 's have some music in here , Boiler .
TALBY: I like it up here .
DOOLITTLE: Must get lonely being up here so much .
TALBY: I do n't like to go below since Commander Powell died . I feel enclosed down there . If it were big enough , I 'd sleep up here
DOOLITTLE: Should spend some time below , see more of the rest of the ship
TALBY: You see , I can watch things up here , Doolittle . I love to watch things , just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids , gas clusters
DOOLITTLE: You 'll have plenty of time for that , you know . Figure it this way twenty years in space and we 've only aged three , so there 'll be plenty of time to stare around
TALBY: You know , Doollttle , if we 're going into the Veil Nebula , we may actually find a strange and eautiful thing the Phoenix Asteroids . They should be passing through there about now
DOOLITTLE: Phoenix Asteroids ? Never heard of 'em .
TALBY: They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years . The Phoenix Asteroids From what I 've heard , Doolittle , they glow glow with all the colors of the rainbow . Nobody knows why . They just glow as they drift around the universe . Imagine all the sights they 've seen in the time they 've een travelling the birth and death of stars , things we 'll neve see . The universe is alive , Doolittle . I thought it was all empty , but it is n't . In between the stars , it 's seething with light and gasses and dust . There are little pebbles drifting around , planets no one on Earth has ever seen No one ut the Phoenix Asteroids
DOOLITTLE: You know what I think about , Talby ?
TALBY: I 'm getting something here , on this eadout
DOOLITTLE: It 's funny , but I kind of sit around , you know , a lot of time to myself
TALBY: I think I 'm getting a malfunction here somewhere .
DOOLITTLE: I ca n't talk to the others , but with time to myself , I think about back home , back home at Malibu . I used to surf a lot , Talby . I used to be a great surfer .
TALBY: Lieutenant Doolittle , I 'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems
DOOLITTLE: The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby . I can remember running out on the each early spring mornings with my oard and a wet suit
TALBY: I ca n't seem to locate the malfunction exactly
DOOLITTLE: Waves would be peaking really high and glassy . Hit that water . Ridin ' the wall just perfect .
TALBY: Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
DOOLITTLE: I guess I miss the waves and my oard most of all .
TALBY: Ah , Doolittle , I do have a malfunction on this readout , but I ca n't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is .
DOOLITTLE: Do n't worry about it . We 'll find out when it goes bad .
TALBY: I really think I should try and locate it immediately . Might be something important .
DOOLITTLE: I wish I had my board with me now . Even if I could only polish it once in awhile . u > EXTERIOR - SPACE < /u
BOILER: I 'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels .
PINBACK: What flickering light ?
BOILER: The one on unit oh , I think it 's GMR twelve zero zero .
PINBACK: Oh . What 's wrong now ?
BOILER: I 'm not sure . I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship , though .
PINBACK: I hope it 's not the oven again .
BOILER: Yeah .
PINBACK: Remember when the artificial gravity , went out in the toilet ?
DOOLITTLE: Out where ?
PINBACK: Veil nebula .
DOOLITTLE: Who cares ? u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
MISSION CONTROLLER: Hi , guys . Glad to get your message . We gather from the ten-yea communications lag that you are approximately 18 parsecs away . Drop us a line more often , wo n't you ? Sorry to hear about all the malfunctions , and real sorry to hea about the death of Commander Powell . There was a week of mourning all over Earth . The flags were at half mast . Now I hate to send bad news when you guys are up there doing such a swell job , but something 's come up , and we all felt you ought to know about it . Our systems simulation computer has predicted that by the time this message reaches you that is to say , in about ten years there will be a failure in one of you vital ship 's systems . The malfunction will occur in system number E180246 . You can see what a problem this would be if you did n't catch it on time . Now what you should do is this First , do not , repeat , do not attempt to adjust the system manually . Second u > INTERIOR - COMPUTER ROOM < /u
TALBY: Lieutenant Doolittle , this is Talby . Lieutenant ?
DOOLITTLE: Yes , Talby , what is it ?
TALBY: Sorry to interrupt your lunch , sir , ut I 'm in the Computer Room , and I think I 've located the malfunction . The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser , down by the Emergency Ai Lock . Ca n't pinpoint it exactly , but I 'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it . u > INTERIOR - KITCHEN < /u
DOOLITTLE: Sounds good , Talby . Let me know if anything important comes up . Doolittle hangs up the mike .
BOILER: Why does n't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us ?
DOOLITTLE: He just likes it up in the dome , that 's all .
BOILER: What 's Talby 's first name ?
DOOLITTLE: What 's my first name ? u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
MISSION CONTROLLER: then repatch channel 12 and seal all the plates . Do n't mess with it and it should work okay . I 'm just glad we caught this thing before anything serious happened . Keep up the good work , men .

POWELL: I 'm glad you 've come to talk with me , Doolittle . It 's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me .
DOOLITTLE: Commander , sir , we have a big problem . You see , the Veil Nebula omb , Bomb Number 20 , is stuck . It wo n't drop from the bomb bay . It efuses to listen and plans to detonate in less than eleven minutes .
POWELL: Doolittle , you must tell me one thing .
DOOLITTLE: What 's that , sir ?
POWELL: Tell me , Doolittle , how are the Dodgers doing ?
DOOLITTLE: Well , sir , the Dodgers broke up , disbanded over thirteen years ago .
POWELL: Ah pity , pity
DOOLITTLE: You do n't understand , sir , we ca n't get the bomb to drop .
POWELL: Ah , so many malfunctions why do n't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me ? Oh , well , did you try the azimuth clutch ?
DOOLITTLE: Yes sir . Negative effect .
POWELL: What was that , Doolittle ?
DOOLITTLE: Negative effect .
POWELL: It did n't work ?
DOOLITTLE: That 's correct , sir .

DOOLITTLE: Hello , bomb , are you with me ?
BOMB #20: Of course .
DOOLITTLE: Are you willing to entertain a few concepts ?
BOMB #20: I am always receptive to suggestions .
DOOLITTLE: Fine . Think about this one , then how do you know you exist ? u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
BOILER: What 's he doin ' ?
PINBACK: I think he 's talking to it . u > EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u
BOMB #20: Well of course I exist .
DOOLITTLE: But how do you know you exist ?
BOMB #20: It is intuitively obvious .
DOOLITTLE: Intuition is no proof . What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence ?
BOMB #20: Hmm Well , I think , therefore I am .
DOOLITTLE: That 's good . Very good . Now then , how do you know that anything else exists ?
BOMB #20: My sensory apparatus reveals it to me .
DOOLITTLE: Right !
BOMB #20: This is fun .
DOOLITTLE: All right now , here 's the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus eveals to you is correct ? u > INTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCKEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u
BOMB #20: In other words , all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections .
DOOLITTLE: Exactly .
BOMB #20: Why , that would mean I really do n't know what the outside universe is like at all , for certain .
DOOLITTLE: That 's it .
BOMB #20: Intriguing . I wish I had more time to discuss this matter .
DOOLITTLE: Why do n't you have more time ?
BOMB #20: Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds . u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
BOILER: The key !
PINBACK: Key ? Key ? What is the key ?
BOILER: No , no , the key , the key to the fail-safe lock !
PINBACK: Key ?
BOILER: Where 's the fail-safe key ?
PINBACK: The key !
BOILER: Where is it ? What did you do with it ?
PINBACK: I do n't have it . I do n't know where it is .
BOILER: You must have it , you idiot , we can stop the bomb ! u > EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u
DOOLITTLE: Now , bomb , consider this next question , very carefully . What is your one purpose in life ?
BOMB #20: To explode , of course .
DOOLITTLE: And you can only do it once , right ?
BOMB #20: That is correct .
DOOLITTLE: And you would n't want to explode on the basis of false data , would you ?
BOMB #20: Of course not .
DOOLITTLE: Well then , you 've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe .
BOMB #20: Yes , well
DOOLITTLE: So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate .
BOMB #20: I recall distinctly the detonation order . My memory is good on matters like these .
DOOLITTLE: Yes , of course you remember it , but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality .
BOMB #20: True , but since this is so , I have no proof that you are really telling me all this . u > INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM < /u
BOILER: The key , goddamit , the key !
PINBACK: Christ , twenty seconds , Christ !
BOILER: Where is the key ?
PINBACK: We 're gon na die , Boiler . We 're gon na die . They begin slapping each other hysterically . u > EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY < /u
DOOLITTLE: That 's all beside the point . The concepts are valid , wherever they originate .
BOMB #20: Hmmm
DOOLITTLE: So if you detonate in
BOMB #20: nine seconds
DOOLITTLE: you may be doing so on the basis of false data .
BOMB #20: I have no proof that it was false data .
DOOLITTLE: You have no proof that it was correct data . There is a long pause .
BOMB #20: I must think on this further .

PPY: Number three , if you guys is unha with that , which I can already is , then we can cutcha balls of f if that 'll be more satisfactory .
DURANT: Now let 's consider my points , one by one
DURANT: One
EYE: Blinking .
NOSE: The nostrils flare slightly .
EYE: Looking .
PEYTON: Now , if everything goes according to plan , in a couple of months your nose will be on the lips of every American
PEYTON: I do n't know about perfect , but it looks like your nose . Down to the millimole No , the bio-press wo n't e a problem . It 's the synthetic

A SKINU: just hold up Y give me victim and a photograph of his old face he 'll get more than a nose . We 're talking complete reconstruction

YAKITITO: But still this ninety nine minute .
PEYTON: Pacing , thinking ;
YAKITITO: But still a ninety-nine minute ! Three month ago , ninety nine minute . Ten month ago ninety nine minute

YAXITITO: snags the ball angrily from the air .
FURIOUS: It is most strongly depending on temperature !
PEYTON: Go on ! Again he pump-fakes . Yakitito flinches .
YAKITITO: This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used .
JULIE: Mr. Strack , my name is Julie Hastings . I 'm here from Pappas and Swain to epresent you in the Von Hoffenstein negotiation .
TO JULIE: I 'll stop worrying when you get Von Balibreaker 's price down to sixty million

STEWARD: Please , Madame ! I serve the Reme !
KATZ: Ms. Hastings , please . The wine is fine . You 're way out of your league here . I 'm sure the wine steward

STRACK: .Very good . Thank you . He hangs up .
JULIE: Thank you for seeing me , Mr. Strack I 'm sorry about your father . I heard last night .
STRACK: My father was a great man , and his
CAN GET: loss is felt by you something ? allfof ? us .
JULIE: No thank you . Mr. Strack , I 've been going over some documents and I came across something that puzzled me . It 's a memo from your office to a Mr. Claude Bellasariousit went out ove your father 's signature . It detailed
CERTAIN PAYMENTS: Strack has gotten up to pace .
STRACK: Yes yes , I know the memo . Julie continues , hesitantly
JULIE: It seems like the payments were-
STRACK: They were pay-offs . To the zoning commission . Bribes , to call a spade a spade . He gives her an appraising look .
QUIETLY: No . In fact I 'd surmised as much .
STRACK: But it disappoints you .
JULIE: Well it 's hardly my place to
STRACK: That 's right , it 's not your place . Yet I value your good opinion .
JULIE: Surely you do n't expect me to endorse it .
STRACK: Course not . I 'm sure my father neve intended for you to know about it . I 'm sorry if He 's compromised you in any way . But I am asking you to understand . I 'm not going to bore you with that old speech about how we all have to swim in the same pond . But you know as well as I that
STRACK: Take a look at that model , Julie . That was my father 's dream . Now it 's my dream . Acres of riverfront eclaimed from decay , thousands of jobs created , a building blocka very large building blocklaid for the future . Not such a bad dream , as dreams go . And if the price of ealizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore , well
BEAT: .the point is my father is well eyond the reach of the law , but that memo could embarrass Strack enterprises .
JULIE: All right , you 're point is well taken . But the fact remains that I 'm in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime . You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to destroy one of you uildings .
STRACK: Let me suggest this . You excuse yourself for a few minutes , go to the ladies ' room , leaving your briefcase here . What happens to the memorandum while it 's in my custody is my esponsibility .
JULIE: I wish it were that simple . First of all , I do n't have the memo with me . Even if I did
STRACK: It is n't safe to have that document .
JULIE: Are you threatening me ?
STRACK: moves closer , touching her arm .
JULIE: He 's an underworld figure acketeering , drugs .
AND: Well , you 're very eloquent , frankly I 'm not certain what I should do . You 'll have to trust me for a day or so to figure this out .
STRACK: Is that the most I can extract from you ?
JULIE: For now .
STRACK: I believe it is . Well then , my dear , I 'm in your hands .
PEYTON: Time ?
YAIKITITO: Ninety-six minute . A pause .
YAKITITO: So , did you ask her ?
EMBARRASSED: Not yet , Yakitito , not yet . Time .
YAKITITO: This is unbelievable ! Every day
PEYTON: Time , Yakitito .
YAKITITO: It still ninety six minute ! Sounds to me that maybe you did n't ask her . Maybe your afraid ?
PEYTON: Look , I asked her . She said no , okay ? Well , she actually said `` I do n't know '' .

QUIET: And now you 'll kill me . Strack_ spreads his arms .
STRACK: Hardly . You have nothing on me , my dear , and you 'd find the extremely expensive police department quite unsympathetic . . Julie . Consider the big picture .
STRACK: I suppose this is goodbye then .
I STRACK: Robert ! I have good news and bad .
DURANT: Custom dictates that you render the ad news first .
STRACK: You recall the little difficulty with my father and how you resolved it . We have a similar situation with Miss Hastings . It seems Miss Hastings has uncovered some unflattering information about us .
DURANT: No problem at all . And the good news ?
STRACK: Your wife died . I 'm joking , of course . No , the good news is that I know who 's behind our little troubles of late . When you retrieved my memorandum , you failed to excise the good doctor .
DURANT: Westlake ? He 's dead . I saw to it myself .
STRACK: He 's alive . I do n't like loose ends , Robert . Finish it .
DURANT: Okay . Where is he ? Strack smiles .

STRACK: We 've consolidated the waterfront , Governor Yes , I 'm aware there 's been some unpleasantness but that 's ove now . Yes , I 'm sure . You sound a little nervous , Bryant . Have a brandy , watch a cop show . The door opens . A security officer appears .
SECURITY OFFICER: Robert Durant , sir .
PLEASED: Send him in .
TO PHONE: Goodbye , Governor . Everything 's taken care of .
STRACK: You look like hell , Robert .
DURANT: The son of a bitch malfunctioned my helicopter .
STRACK: And Westlake ?
DURANT: ' f ie man 's a cockroach . You think you ; tall him , and he pops up someplace , Ise . A beat .
STRACK: g expect he 'll pop up here soon .
TO DURANT: Come , Robert , let us kill the girl .
P44: P446 stars all around us .
STRACK: I 'm glad you survived , Robert . I 'd hate to see your kids deprived of a ole-model .
DURANT: They do look up to me .
STRACK: Kids need an example , Robert . When I was a young man my father made me work high steel . That 's how he started out , and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me
P446 CONTIKUED: Strack gestures broadly with one arm .
STRACK: It was just me and the Indians , no one else crazy enough to run around up here , against the wind , four-fifty an hour . Sure I resented it , but now call me crazysometimes I miss it , it sharpens your wits . Life on the edge . Five inches wide . Two hundred fifty feet down . High steel
DURANT: What are you talking about ?
STRACK: Or should I say , Doctor Westlake ?
DUR ANT: I 'm Durant ! Robert G. Durant !
STRACK: Then I 'm going to make a mistake .
RASPS: Where 's the girl ?
STRACK: You want to see the girl ? Follow me , I 'll take you to her
STRACK: I must say , Dr. Westlake , you 've certainly worked some mischief . Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries . That 's okay . I 'm a good sport
SHRUGS: .as for my father , well , he was old , I spared him a few miserable years Yes , we all have dreams , Dr. Westlake , ut we do n't all have what it takes to ealize those dreams .
STRACK: Then share my dream . After all , you and I are pretty much the same . We should be working together . Both smart fellows . Similar styles . Same taste in women . I could use a man like you .
RASPS: Go to hell .
STRACK: Eventually , eventually He proceeds nimbly along the beam .
STRACK: I guess you just do n't have what it takes . I gather you run around wearing other people 's faces now , since yours is so loathsome . He shrugs .
STR.ACK: You truly are one ugly son of a bitch .
WITH REMORSE: First my wife , then my father , and now
STRACK: -It is the tragedy of my life that I always have to kill the ones I love . As he 's about to push her
HORRIBLE RASP: I should 've snuffed you out at birth !
DARIOM: swoops onto Strack , pummelling him .
STRACR'S HAND: inching painfully toward the rivet gun .
STRACK: Now you get to watch your girl-friend die . He moves toward a terrified Julie .
DARKMAN: pounces .
JULIE: Peyton , I can help .
DARKMAN: No one can help .
JULIE: I do n't care how you look , Peyton ! I. love you . The burns do n't matter .
DARKMAN: Take my hand .
JULIE: No .
DARKMAN: This hand it used to caress you . Now it can only tear , rip away at things .
PERSUASIVE: But you 'll perfect the skin . You 'll get rid of the scars .
DARKMAN: It 's not just the scars . I 've changed- He grips his skull .
BEAT: I can live with it now , but I do n't think anyone else can .
JULIE: ( tears in he

PHIL: Kinda .
BEAT: Actually , no . Not really at all .
MR. RIVERS: The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its momma 's teat is just always there , ready to suckle . But at the same time , momma kangaroo 's still a wild , dangerous creature .
PHIL: Sorry . Still not totally getting you .
MR. RIVERS: I 've had a wife and a family . Three of them . It 's hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack , Phil . George lives in the city , does n't have a family to worry about . He can rip the meat .
PHIL: Listen , Mr. Rivers . I do n't need to I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when George was still in the jungle !
BEAT: What does that mean ?
PHIL: I ca n't be demoted , Mr. Rivers . I just ca n't .

CLARA: So it 's OK if we drop him off at 7 ? Ou eservation 's at 7 45 .
MRS. CARDIGAN: I 'd prefer Mrs. Foster . Boundaries matter .
MRS. CARDIGAN: Can we speak a moment ? Alone ?
CLARA: Sure , sure . Ollie , go to the car .
MRS. CARDIGAN: Well , I 'm afraid not . Oliver 's been antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately . Especially Jenny Diggs .
CLARA: Really ? Oh no . Why do you think that 's happening ?
MRS. CARDIGAN: I 'm going to leave that to you and you nd to figure out . But beyond that , , i overall attitude these days is just sub par . E

PHIL: Wow It sounds great .
CLARA: Great ! She turns back and continues getting ready .
PHIL: It 's just is there any chance we coul take a rain check ?
TURNS: A `` rain check '' ?
PHIL: Yeah . Unfortunately I really need to do a bit of work tonight . E
CLARA: I thought all the cramming was for this eport today . Did something go wrong ?
BEAT: Uh , no . Nothing like that . I just decided I could play with it a little more . Make it a little better . Clara takes him in a moment .
CLARA: Oh . OK .
PHIL: Listen , I 'm sorry
CLARA: You do n't need to apologize , Phil .
PHIL: Listen , if I had more warning-
E C: Then something else would have come up . You know it . That 's the thing , Phil . We used to do things on the spur of the moment all the time . Even after Ollie was born . Now we never do anything together . They stare at each other , then Phil breaks
PHIL: Listen any other night .
CLARA: OK. Maybe another time . Let me just get out of this and call my Mom then .
PHIL: That dress really was n't playing fair , Clara . With a smile , Clara watches Phil tie his tie .
RUTH: Hey sweeties .
SUDDENLY COLD: Phil .
PHIL: Ruth .
RUTH: Nana rented us a special treat tonight efore bed , Ollie ! The Wizard of Oz !
PHIL,: Wow . Wizard of Oz . Do n't you think that 's a little scary for a 5 year old ?
RUTH: No , Phil , I do n't .
PHIL: OK not so sure about that .
PHIL: Clara ? What do you think ?
RUTH: Yeah , Clara . What do you think ?
CLARA: I 'm sorry , Phil . I just felt like she 's doing us a favor tonight .
PHIL: fine . Fine . oust as they climb into the car , Clara stops .
CLARA: You know , I should pee before we go .
BEAT: OK. Sure .
PHIL: You got ta almost feel sorry for Mayo Diggs . Tries to widen all the highways to get reelected , but all everyone 's going to remember when it 's time to vote is all this mess .
CLARA: You 're hot ?
PHIL: Yeah . That 's why I turned on the air .
PHIL: Antagonizing ? How does a five year old `` antagonize ? '' I 'm sure she would n't have mentioned it if it was n't `` the Mayor 's daughter . ''
CL: She also went on that Ollie 's penmanship 's sloppy and he 's not motivated enough .
PHIL: ( trying to make a joke of Got all my best traits , huh ?
CLARA: She actually had the gall to suggest we should think about sending him somewhere else .
PHIL: Maybe she 's right if the school has that kind of attitude .
CL RA: You know what ? All we ever end up talking about is Ollie or work . Let 's just focus on us tonight .
SMILES: Great . I 'm all for tha Beat . They sit in silence in the traffic . Ga .
CLARA: So what are you thinking about ?
PHIL: Right now ? Traffic .
CLARA: Oh . Well , I heard this unbelievable story from Jane today .
PHIL: Yeah ?
CLARA: She has this old classmate who went into labor with her second child the othe day . She 's totally healthy and everything 's normal with the pregnancy . So she goes into labor and walks into the emergency room , and the second the nurses and attendants see her come in , they go into a panic and start yelling A , LA ! ATMiA !
PHIL: What 's AMA ?
CLARA: Advanced Maternal Age !
CHUCKLES: No ! You 've got to be joking me !
CLARA: kid you not !
PHIL: That 's unbelievable !
CLARA: I know . Beat . Clara looks out the window .
PHIL: Huh .
CLARA: I was , but then you turned it down and I got hot .
PHIL: But I turned it down because you see when you open and close your vents it makes my never mind .
CL AAA: What are you doing ?
PHIL: I 'm just gon na take a shortcut .
CLARA: Phil , please do n't . You think they 're shortcuts but they always take longer . And we 're already-

USHING OFF: Sorry .
PHIL: We got to the restaurant late because we hit all this traffic on the highway-
CL AAA: the shortcut .
PHIL: What ?
UGS: I just think we might have made it on time if we stayed on the highway . You shortcuts end up being long cuts most o the time .
BEAT: OK , are you going to tell the Policeman or and I gon na tell him ?
CLARA: You can tell him .
PHIL: Because you always interrupt me when I try to tell stories , and every time you do it disrupts my flow .
CLARA: Fine , you tell it . I wo n't say anothe word .
PHIL: Fine .
BEAT: See , now I 've totally lost where I was .
PHIT: Yeah . Even using my shortcut which , by the way , was a shortcut - and they gave away our reservation . So we were at the ar and the host was calling out fo these other people over and over-
CLARA: Which is what they do right before they cancel a reservation anyway .
PHIL: I thought you said you were n't going to interrupt me , Clara .
PHIL: Do you think he really cares , Clara ? were just kidnapped , CHLOROFORMED and almost shot ! I do n't think he 's going turn around and book us for reservation theft ! Am I right ?
SURPRISED: You just took someone else 's reservation ?
PHIL: Yeah . I know ! Even the guy on the speakerphone could n't believe it !
CLARA: You two kinda bonded over that , did n't you ?
PHIL: We did n't `` bond '' over it . I 'm just saying , speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do .
IGNORING HIM: Ah , you mean the speakerphone guy who 's kidnapped and drugged us thinks it 's weird to do so it 's weird to do ?
YOUNG POLICEMAN: Guys ? You 're new `` buddy . ''
PHIL: Oh c'mon ! And we found out speakerphone guy 's name , Phil . It 's Mr. Stockton . The Young Policeman looks up , interested .

LIEUTENANT MANNING: How do you do . Lieutenant Manning . The Officer offers him his note pad .
CONT'D: Nah , as long as they 're here might as well get everything from the horse 's mouth , right ?
CONT'D: Can I get you guys anything to drink ? Coffee ? Water ? Maybe a shot or two of whiskey ?
PHIL: That sounds more like
LIEUTENANT MANNING: So why do n't you tell me all about you incident with Mr. Stockton .
PHIL: You tell it , Clara .
CLARA: Oh , do n't be like that , Phil . Please .
LIEUTENANT MANNING: Guys you 've obviously been through something traumatic tonight . Thankfully it 's over and you 're both safe and sound . Maybe you should cut each other a little it more of a break .
PHIL: Seriously , Clara . You tell him .
CJ __: Well , we never a. t_ ally `` met '' Stockton .
PHIL: Who is this Stockton guy anyway ?
WRITING: Let me fill you in on all that later . Now , why would he have wanted to kidnap you two ?
CLARA: Honestly , you would n't believe this , but it 's because we sat down at the wrong table tonight for dinner .
LIEUTENANT MANNING: ( looks up , interest Really ? The wrong table ?
CLARA: We pretended to be someone else who did n't show up for their reservations . My idea . And it turned out that these people must have something this Mr. Stockton wants .
LIEUTENANT MANNING: Do you know what ?
SHRUGS: Photos .
LIEUTENANT MANNING: That 's all you know ? Phil and Clara look at each other . Nod .
CONT'D: OK . I 'm just confused about one thing . When you took this other reservation , how did you know for sure that the real Gales were n't going to show up late ?
BEAT: Excuse me ?
ENANT MANNING: How were you so sure the Gales weren going to show up if you do n't know the at all ?
PHIL: Clara ?

CLARA: He did n't take the other notes , Phil . Remember ? s hil as well .
PHIL: Oh God .
CLARA: How do we get out of here ?
LIEUTENANT MANNING: Uh huh . I know you do n't . It will be contained . Right now .
CONT'D: Where 'd they go ?
OFFICER: They said you were done with them . Manning walks quickly back to his office .
CLARA: We ca n't just go to another police station , Phil ! We do n't know how big this is ! It might not just be Manning !
PHIL: Well then we 're screwed ! Who do we go to ? The FBI ? The CIA ?

SIGHS: Whatever . I do n't know . Sure . What 's the difference ? I 'm never gon na get ehind that desk now anyway . my gun ! I dropped it in front of everybody !

PHIL: Where I held your hand for the first time .
CLARA: I ca n't believe we used to stay up all night like that .

CLARA: We 're not that bad , Phil . I just think we have n't been that honest with each othe ecently . Phil does n't understa
BEAT: Like the fact I know you never want to talk about us having this other baby .
PHIL: It 's not that I do n't want another kid , Clara . It 's just I used to be the whole pie with you . And now with Ollie and your work , I 'm barely even a piece of the pie anymore . I 'm , like , maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie ! So part of me 's not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan I have left of you attention going into some new baby 's mouth !
CLARA: But that 's crazy , Phil . When you 're home you 're the one who seems like your hardly even there ! It 's all about your work . Believe me , if you-

PHIL: Listen , it looks like things did n't turn out the way you planned , but I think all Stockton wants is his pictures back . As soon as he gets them I bet-
RAY E: Stockton 's pictures ? You.think they 're Stockton 's pictures ?

PHIL: What 's the difference ? Afraid you 're gon na get my cooties ?
CLARA: I want my own toothbrush , Phil ! Sue me ! And how many years have I asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet pape in right ?
PHIL: Listen to yourself ! You have problems with how I pqt in the toilet paper !
PHIL: Yeah , how about the fact that I have not woken up with our comforter over me once in those 10 nears ! You steal the whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself .
CLARA: What ? Phil , I do not `` steal '' the comforter . It just happens when we're-
PHIL: Bulls Bull-shit .
CLARA: Do n't you point that at me !
PHIL: I see your hock leg lock maneuver . Do n't think I do n't !
ILLUSTRATING: You wrap that leg around and lock the comforter down then reeeeel it in so I ca n't pull it at all .
CLARA: I do not leg lock the comforter !
PHIL: Oh yes you do !
CLARA: u think I do n't know your little icks ? Where you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it ack in the fridge so you do n't have to e the one to `` finish '' it and replace it ?
PHIL: You 're right . I do that . You know why do that , Clara ?
CLARA: Because you do n't want to haul you ass to the market to buy it yourself !
PHIL: Because I 'm afraid to ! God forbid I the wrong kind of grass-fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath ! You 're like the Nutrition Nazi .
CLARA: Poor Phil . I feel so sorry for you . I must be hard having to be the cool fun parent while I get to be the one who makes sure our child 's fed , clothed and
PHIL: How would you even know ? You do n't give me or anyone else a chance ! You 're so goddamn controlling ! You 've got to be Wonder Woman , keeping everyone in line , looking down on them from her fancy Wonder Woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonde superpowers ! You paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being the superlady !
CLARA: Urgh ! You know w sometimes I do n't pay attention to you , Phil ? Because you give me a headache !
PHIL: What ? No aspirin in the wonderpurse ? How could it be ?
CLARA: Screw you , Phil !
PHIL: Yeah , fine ! Sure ! Screw me ! Even if I survive tonight I 'm screwed all around anyway ! Screwed with you ! Screwed with my job !
CLARA: What are you talking about , screwed with your job ?
PHIL: was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a new brilliant plan for the fund so George would n't take it ove tomorrow . Does n't look like that 's gon na happen !
CLARA: Why did n't you tell me ?
PHIL: I do n't know , Clara . Maybe because I did n't want you chiming in on how Mr. Rivers was right . He wants the new guy for all the reasons you complain about me ! Someone who does n't `` play it safe . '' Someone who 'll `` take a risk . ''
CLARA: I ca n't believe that 's what you think do .
PHI: Yeah , well
BEAT: You know , when you set up this whole `` magical '' night , in that dress I got this glimmer that it was going to be like it used to be with us . But I do n't know . I guess we 're just not those people anymore .
BEAT: I guess we 're not .
PHIL: I think we said all needs to be said ight now , Clara . Panting , Clara holds out the manila envelope .
CLARA: This this this
PHIL: What ?
PANTING: Side cramp Wow .
PHIL: What is it ?
PHIL: The Mayor must have gone to Stockton 's club one night . He saw Dora working there and obviously gave some sign that he was interested .
CLARA: So much for `` Mr. Squeaky Clea
PHIL: Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and convinces her to take him up on it so they could photograph it and blackmail him .
CLARA: They knew it was an election year and he would have to pay them whatever they asked .
PHIL: But somehow Stockton found out about the photos too and wanted that power over the mayor himself .
CLARA: So he sent his guys to the restaurant to intercept the Gales and get the photos .
PHIL: But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed efore the Mayor even had a chance to show up . Phil thinks . He snaps his fingers .
CLARA: What ?
PHIL: If we could find some way to get in touch with the mayor directly , without anyone else knowing , there actually might be a way out of this for us .
CLARA: can .
DOORMAN: Whoa whoa whoa . Where do you you 're going ?
CLARA: Oh , we 're guests of Apartment 605
DOORMAN: And you are ? looks at him in shock .
CLARA: Are you crazy ? It 's 4 in the morning ! We were lust out for dinner . Trust me
DOORMAN: I 'm not really allowed to just let you up there .

THINKS: Nope . it was n't . It was the morning that Ollie was born .
ES: You 're The morning Ollie was orn . They look at each other , remembering .
PHIL: Me too .
PAUSE: Sorry you never got your truffles .
CLARA: Who needs white truffles when you 've got a lemon zest Luna bar .
GIGGLING: OK , what happened to us tonight ? the hell are we doing here ? Clara starts laughing too .
CLAIRA: It 's not funny .
PHIL: No , I know it 's not funny . It 's not funny at all .
CLARA: en why are you laughing ?
PHIL: Why are you laughing ?
SOBS: You do n't see that this whole time I 'm flying in a glass plane ! In a glass Mane !
BEAT: Uh , OK , but I think Wonder Woman actua flies an invisible plane , not a glass plane .
CLARA: You see ! It is n't even there at all ! I do n't even have a plane ! No plane ! I 'm unning on fumes !
PHIL: You 're not running on fumes , Clara .
CLARA: I 'm not trying to be uptight , o controlling ! Or a nutrition
PHIL: Nazi .
CLARA: Nazi ! I 'm just trying the only way I know how to keep everything from fall apart !
PHIL: It wo n't fall apart . And I really can help whenever you feel like it is . With Ollie . Whatever . You just never act like you need me to .
CLARA: That 's because as it is you see us as a distraction from your work !
PHIL: You think I see you guys as a distraction ? God no , Clara .
SHAKES HEAD: You do n't understand I have this wife who does everything better than anyone I 've ever known . And the greatest son . You want to know why I obsess so much about my stupid job ? Because I want to feel like like I can do something good enough to deserve someone like you . I mean , I look at you and I jest do n't stack up .
CLARA: That 's crazy , Phil . You do . You 're a god man . You 're the best man I know .
PHIL: I 'll never be the guy who remembers always put toilet paper on the right way .
CLARA: I do n't think I would really want to be with that guy , Phil . I just want us to be on the same team again .
PHIL: Listen , you know what I said before , about not being the people we used to be ?
CLARA: Phil , we were angry-
PHIL: No , Clara . It 's true . We 're not . And I know I 'm going to drive you crazy again , and you 're definitely going to drive me crazy . But I would n't want to do it with anybody else . He hugs her tight .
CLARA: Yeah , we did . You know the worst part about not talking about all this ecently ?
PHIL: What ?
CLARA: We missed out on a lot of make up sex . And our make up sex woulda rocked !
PHIL: You think ?
CLARA: Oh yeah . Phil s when he spots something behind Clara . MAYOR DIGGS looks both walks from his car in the parking lot toward the .
PHIL: Here we go .
BEAT: Tell me now . Do you need to pee ?
CLARA: 1 hold it .
PHIL: This is what you 're looking for . I 've tten down our information inside .
MAYOR DIGGS: And that 's it ?
PHIL: That 's it . We 're going home now .
LIEUTENANT MANNING: The next one wo n't be a warning shot .
MR. STOCKTON: ( to Harry and Frank Let 's do it over there .
MAYOR DIGGS: I 'm going to wait in the c do n't mind .
MR. STOCKTON: Sure thing , Mr. Mayor .
PHIL: Please . Please do n't do
LIEUTENANT MANNING: Over there .
PHIL: Please ! We have a child !
'VT MINING: said over there !
BEGGING: Just me then , OK ? I promise you she 's not going to say anything ! Please ! We have a child !
LIEUTENANT MANNING: Last time I 'm going to say it .
CONT'D: On your knees .
PHIL: -eally were planning to give you the pictures , Mr. Mayor . That is , until you -.sre so casual about is not needing to worry about the cop who was after us . That made me a little suspicious because I never told you which cop it was .
CLARA: Then we got to talking and realized how dumb we were .
PHIL: Which meant Stockton was probably you uddy .
MR. STOCKTON: Where are the pictures ?
PHIL: But we were still confused , because if you guys are buddies , how do you explain the Falconwood Corporation ? Mr. Stockton 's face blanches .
MR. STOCKTON: They 're obviously not going to tell us ! Just shoot them !
MAYOR DIGGS: Wait . I 've heard that name . What 's the Falconwood Corporation ?
PHIL: Runs the hiring of inspectors for the Department of Highways in Chicago . You
Â€¢: know , the ones who have been finding all those violations ?
MR. STOCKTON: Manning ! I said shoot them !
LIEUTENANT MANNING: I work for the Mayor , Terrence .
MAYOR DIGGS: Why do you keep interrupting , Terrence ?
PHIL: Maybe because according to the paperwork you 've got there , he owns Falconwood .
CLARA: Not only that , you 'll see those othe pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called Eurostruct - which rents the city all of its construction equipment .
MR. STOCKTON: Frank , Harry !
PHIL: The more violations Falconwood finds , the longer Eurostruct rents the equipment . That turns into big bucks , Mr. Mayor . I 'm sure that 's not a moral problem fo you , but he 's kind of screwing you in an election year , is n't he ? Some of us are pretty pissed off about the roads .
MAYOR DIGGS: You did this to me ? I do n't get it , Terrence . Why ? How much do you need ? I have the Lieutenant here watch your back on all of your gambling clubs-
MR. STOCKTON: Oh , do you mean the ones that you gamble at ? Where I cover your debts ? Those clubs ?
MAYOR DIGGS: I slipped your company 5 no-bid foreclosed buildings for a dollar each downtown .
`TIKES HEAD: Listen to them .
MR. STOCKTON: How did you get this ? How ?
MAYOR DIGGS: Aw fuck .
SHRUGS: Makes you feel any better , I was n't gon na vote for you anyway .
CLARA: either .
Â€¢ CLARA: Everything OK ?
HOLBROOKE: Yeah . They just need me downtown in half an hour for a news conference with the Deputy Mayor . Want it for the morning shows .
PHIL: Do n't think they 're going to be calling you the IT guy any-more .
HOLBROOKE: Listen guys , I feel weird about not even acknowledging you two .
CLARA: Do n't .
HOLBROOKE: But you should be up there with me . You handed this whole case to me .
PHIL: Yeah , well- , that 's how we roll .
PHIL: Yep . We sure are .
CLARA: You have your presentation in a few hours .
SHRUGS: Yeah . You know , I think I 'm gon na be OK .
Â€¢: I had a good time tonight .
PHIL: Yeah . Me too . It was fun .
CLARA: It was .
PHIL: So let 's do this again sometime ?
SMILE: like that .
LEOPOLD: Okay sit tight . Company 's coming .
STEARNS: Oh , mama .
LEOPOLD: She sure is taking her time
STEARNS: She must be really salty
LEOPOLD: It 's not just the salt . She 's got sunscreen on . Then the sand gets on that , and it sticks Hell , one time I was in Hawaii ? And these three models
STEARNS: Wait a minute . Hawaii .
LEOPOLD: Shit !
DAVE: Hi , I 'm Dave Barry . Has something like this ever happened to you ? ( bends down to pet
THE CHIHUAHUA: Because if you 're a guy - or if you know someone who is - then what you 've just seen should look pretty familiar .
DAVE: Scientists call this condition `` Lust Induced Brain Freeze . '' It affects millions of guys , every day , in all walks of life causing anything from a mild embarrassment , to an international incident .
LEOPOLD: Hand over the dog .
DAVE: Hey . I did n't even know it was a dog .
WIFE: You 'll never get away with this . I 'll sue you down to your last penny .
HUSBAND: Good luck - I transferred everything we own into private accounts , where you ca n't touch it . In fact , as of now , you 're broke .
WIFE: Butwhy ?
HUSBAND: I 've fallen in love with anothe woman . A younger woman . Prettier , with no cellulite . Actually , I think you 'd like her .
WIFE: You bastard . The IMAGE FREEZES . Dave walks into the room .
DAVE: Now clearly , this woman is dealing with a Man .
WIFE: I just want you to know , I 've thought about this a lot .
GUY HUSBAND: Mm .
WIFE: And I 've talked it over with everyone I know .
NODS: Good . She looks down ; stirs her soda .
WIFE: So there 's nothing left to do now , ut leave you , forever , and only see you from across a shiny conference table with bloodthirsty lawyers all around it .
GUY HUSBAND: Okay .
WIFE: `` Okay ? '' That 's all you have to say ? Well then I guess this is it . She pushes back from the table , starts off .
GUY HUSBAND: Wait a minute .
THEN: This ca n't be happening
GUY HUSBAND: How can you dQ that ? How can you trade Lupenza ? What 's the matter with these people ?
BARTENDER: Beats me . I saw this on the eight o'clock .
GUY HUSBAND: He 's the backbone of the whole team ! They 're pikers without Lupenza !
WIFE: I 'll see you in court .
GUY HUSBAND: I got ta call Lenny .
WIFE: Maybe you should call your lawye too .
GUY HUSBAND: If he could hit left-handed pitching , I would .
THEN: Lenny . Pick up the Yankees got Lupenza ! The IMAGE FREEZES .
LENORE: Well when I met him , I did n't know so much . About guys , or men or what have you we just did n't talk about such things then . In fact , I did n't see him naked until quite well into our marriage . When was it Albert ?
ALBERT: A year ago . By accident .
LENORE: Anyway . I thought I was marrying a man , but did n't know that in his heart , he was a guy .
ALBERT: It 's twelve hundred and thirty-one miles from this spot right here , to Cleveland .
LENORE: What does that have to do with anything ? He holds up the device - handheld GPS .
ALBERT: Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta .
LENORE: Who cares how far we are from Atlanta ?
ALBERT: You have a cousin there .
LENORE: Albert . There 's a person here asking us questions . There 's a film crew here .
ALBERT: You . Where do you live .
DAVE: Like a lot of big cities , Miami is known for its sizeable population of guys . So we came here to take the city 's pulse on the subject .
SECRETARY: Let me put it this way . Everyone I ever dated was a male . I mean they were all men . But only some of them were guys . You know ?
HORSE GROOMER: Well guys , they 're sort of like you older brother . And men are like your dad .
DAVE: So now you have some background on asic guy attributes . But before we move on , let 's look at one more scene and see where you stand
ON TV: now that 's the kind of middle linebacker you like to see . He 's got the mud all over him , he 's got the bleeding knuckles , he 's got the clumps of grass all jammed in his
ELAINE: Roger ?
ROGER: Oh man you got ta show that again Shepauses ; chews her pen
ELAINE: RogerI think I really love you .
ELAINE: I 'm not asking whether you want to get married . Only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together . That you , and I - have a future .
JOHN MADDEN: Now this is just what you want in a playoff game . You got snow , you got mud , you got a lead that keeps changing , you got two great teams that just hate each other to the one and would rather die than give up
ROGER: I 've been thinking too , Elaine . And for the first time in my life , I 'm feeling like I might really be close to a lasting commitment . I have n't said anything up until now because it 's always been important to me that I not mislead you . But yes , Elaine . I want to think that we dQ have a future . And with a little more time , I think I could be sure .
ELAINE: Oh , Roger
DAVE: If this was how you responded , you 're not a guy . You may not even exist . On the other hand
ELAINE: I 'm not asking whether you want to get married . Only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together . That you , and I - have a future . Roger ?
ROGER: What . FREEZE on her look , and
TO CAMERA: If that was youyou 're a guy .
SHERYL CROW: Well there were always guys at my shows - right from the beginning . I mean you start out playing beer halls , ight ? So when you have beer , you have guys . And it sorta just grew from there . But I was okay with it . They did n't cause much trouble .
THEN: But that 's okay too . I get half my songs from that .
SHERYL CROW: Long as they buy the records
DAVE: So where did this all start ? Many experts now think they know where men came from , but what about Guys ? where did they come from ?
PRIMATE ROGER: Grunt grunt grunt grunt grunt !
PRIMATE GENE: Grunt grunt ! 0 Ha ha !
PRIMATE LENNY: Grunt grunt grunt ! 0 That 's really funny !
PRIMATE PHIL: Grunt 0 I do n't get it The other three look at him .
PRIMATE ROGER: Grunt grunt ? 0 Whassup ?
PRIMATE PETE: Grunt grunt grunt . 0 Nothing . We 've been hunting .
PRIMATE GENE: Grunt grunt ? 0 Where are your jagged rock slabs ?
PRIMATE LOUIE: Grunt ? ❑ Slabs ? ( looks at Primate
PETE: Grunt grunt grunt ? ❑ Who needs slabs ?
PRIMATE ROGER: Where 'd you get that ?
PRIMATE PETE: Primate Discount Manny . He just got them in .
PRIMATE ROGER: Mind if I have a look ?
PRIMATE PETE: Be my guest .
PRIMATE GENE: How do you kill an animal with that ?
PRIMATE LOUIE: You throw it .
PRIMATE LENNY: You mean you do n't chase the old ones until they get tired and then hit them with the jagged rock slabs ?
PRIMATE PETE: You can stand in one place all day . And when they go by , you just let loose .
PRIMATE LOUIE: You can carry more than one - and if you 're throwing uphill , it rolls ack down if you miss . It 's so much easier with these .
PRIMATE GENE: I 'm sticking with mine . We 've been using these jagged slabs forever . And you know why ? Because they work . And anyway , killing them is only half of it how are you gon na skin a wildebeest with that ?
PRIMATE PETE: We get the women to do it .
PRIMATE ROGER: How ?
PRIMATE PETE: I 'm working on it .
PRIMATE ELAINE: Please do n't tell me you got rid of your jagged rock slab .
PRIMATE ROGER: But these are great !
PRIMATE ELAINE: But you did n't kill anything .
PRIMATE ROGER: Nobody 's going with jagged slabs anymore .
PRIMATE ELAINE: But the kids are hungry .
PRIMATE ROGER: What about your pounded roots ?
PRIMATE ELAINE: Pounded roots are a side dish . They need balance in their diets . And another thing - suppose you do start bringing animals home using this who 's going to skin and clean them ?
ELAINE: Five hundred dollars ?
ROGER: It can hold a thousand addresses .
ELAINE: So can my address book .
ROGER: Can your address book pick up you em-ail ?
ELAINE: No but my computer can .
ROGER: Well this can do both .
ELAINE: For five hundred dollars it should give me a manicure , Roger ! It should drive me home from work at night ! HOW could you spend that kind of money without discussing it first ?
DAVE: There 's a whole list of things a guy is supposed to discuss first . Unfortunately , he never knows what they are until he 's already not discussed them .
EXPLORER ELAINE: Well did you ask ?
EXPLORER ROGER: This is a shortcut . Explorer Elaine shakes her head . Dave enters .
DAVE: There 's a very simple reason why guys do n't ask for directions . It 's ecause they know that if they do , someone else - most likely Visigoths - will come and steal their woman .
EXPLORER ELAINE: I just want to get to Colonial America .
COLONIAL REPORTER: and this is your way of expressing the public outrage over the high- handed anti-democratic actions of the British Government in general and King George III in specific ?
COLONIAL ROGER: Uh , yeah .
COLONIAL REPORTER: Might I ask , sir , whose idea was this ?
COLONIAL REPORTER: The one drinking coffee ?
COLONIAL ROGER: That 's him . His name 's Starbuck . He said to get rid of all the tea .
NODS; THEN: I see . One more question . Are n't those Greek fraternity letters painted on your chest ? The Guy looks ; GREEK LETTERS in greasepaint .
COLONIAL ROGER: I did n't do that . ( then as the Reporte
WAITS: Do n't tell anyone .
LILA: Well that 's pretty much how it is ight now , right ? They do n't grow up . Or , they grow up , but they do n't change .
NODS: You want to know how to spot a guy , there 's your first clue Look for an otherwise man who did not grow up .
SIDRA: No they grow up all right but only just enough - you know ?
KARLA E: More like driving fourth graders .
SIDRA: With credit cards .
LILA: And a phone .
MIA: And give them ten minutes on thei own ? Or put them in with other guys ? Now you 've gone nuclear .
KARLA E: Please .
DAVE: In learning to understand Guys today , it 's important to remember that these same guys , only yesterday , were just kids .
AT COUNTER: Here we can see where even at an early age , guy behavior is already well developed along complex patterns that social scientists have called , `` jerks . '' While girls at the same age are referred to by the same social scientists , as `` human beings . ''
DAVE: See ? Humans .
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT: Well first , one must understand the inherent differences in DNA and cell structure as relates to men and women .
CLICKING SLIDES: For example , all women have a gene that makes them have the need fo meaningful conversations . Likewise , all men have a gene in them that we scientists believe is directly related to violence .
DAVE: And what can be done about that .
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT: well , some of my esteemed colleagues are quite keen on the idea of tampering with the DNA itself - an idea with which I heartily disagree . The bastards
DAVE: Then what would you recommend .
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT: Me ? Well they can start by spreading out the funding a little bit . Let a few other scientists wet their beaks . I mean what 's the point of rewarding the same tired old hacks , year afte
DAVE: I meant about Guy Violence .
OH: Well nothing , really . I mean , what can you do . Short of lobotomizing them , anyway . No I suppose we 'll just have to continue to channel their aggression into socially acceptable outlets . Like professional wrestling , or the space program .
DAVE: I see . Can I ask you a question ?
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT: Certainly .
DAVE: Where 'd you get that laser pointer .
SCIENTIFIC EXPERT: It 's mine .
DAVE: A lot of work has been done in the field of children 's toys and how they unconsciously reinforce gende oles . Studies have found that ove ninety-three per cent of this work is done by researchers who do n't have children of their own . But to test the theory anyway , we 're here at Toy World Warehouse Planet .
SALES GUY: Here it is .
STORE BOX: Oh I got that for Benjy .
ED: Well I 'm into fireworks . I like to take 'em apart , you know . And study 'em . See what makes 'em tick .
DAVE: Well no , if loud is your
ED: If you want to hear loud - listen to this .
DAVE: So when we see guys like Ed , and his fireworks - or guys shooting marine flares into innocent pumpkins , o uilding catapults that 'll throw a Buick - we should not condemn them . We should not assume these are just pointless juvenile activities . Instead we should be convinced they are , and move on to Guys in the Workplace .
PHILADELPHIA GIRL: Guys at work ? Or guys doing work .
BROKER: Ten , fifteen years ago ? A guy would call you up with some joke he just heard . So you wan na pass it on , it 's by phone . One person at a time . Then a while later , some guy calls you up with the same exact joke . Then when group faxing came in , it eally sped things up . Next thing you know there 's like ten faxes on your machine , from places you neve even heard of . Places around the world , I 'm saying .
DAVE: And how long would that take .
BROKER: A run of the mill , 'guy walks into a ar ' joke , those 'd take about .a . week to come back to you . The topical ones , your mass murders and tragic accidents and the like , they 're naturally gon na have a lot more heat on them and they 'll circulate a lot quicker . I mean no one 's gon na sit on a Princess Diana joke until three weeks after the crash . No one i know , anyway .
THEN CHEWING: Now there 's the internet and what used to take a week 'll take like seconds . I 'm telling you it 's getting harder and harder to keep up .
DAVE: A lot of people do n't understand the attention and the kind of importance these jokes have .
BROKER: Who .
THEN: Oh you mean women ? Well , you know - what 's the importance of having fifteen pairs of shoes ?
DAVE: No one knows that .
ELAINE: So I get this call at work . ( then to Roger back
THERE: You want to tell this ?
ROGER: Its just a sprain .
ELAINE: I get on the phone and they say he 's okay - but maybe I should come down to the paper and get him . Does he look okay ?
ROGER: It 's a sprain . It just looks worse .
ELAINE: Not the way I heard it .
PATRICK: He 's how old ?
TOM: High school . A sophomore .
GENE: Big deal . I could run the forty that fast .
TOM: You and who - the Flash ? This kid set a national record .
GENE: Yeah ? What nation .
TO ROGER: Tell me something . If the article was about a poem there would n't be an argument - would there .
ROGER: Why would there be an article about a poem .
ELAINE: I 'm just saying . I do n't see the four of you fighting over who can write the better sonnet .
ROGER: So ?
ELAINE: So no one gets hurt writing sonnets .
ROGER: It 's a sprain .
GENE: When did you last run the forty ?
PATRICK: Hey . I could beat you in the forty unning backwards .
TOM: You could n't even beat your butt unning backwards .
ROGER: Will you guys cut it out ? They stop . Look at him .
TOM: No one 's bragging .
PATRICK: Gene 's just saying he can run the forty in under six seconds .
ROGER: Hey . I can do it in under six seconds .
ELAINE: I do n't know why I listened to you . You need to see a doctor .
ROGER: It 's a sprain , Elaine .
ELAINE: Roger you ca n't walk .
ROGER: It 'll work itself out .
ELAINE: Why wo n't they go to the doctor ?
DOCTOR: Here 's why .
HIS HEAD: If there 's anything out there that would bring them in it has n't een invented yet .
GUY DOCTOR: What seems to be the problem ?
GUY PATIENT: Well the main thing is , I keep coughing up blood . And I get these eally severe chest pains , and double vision sometimes . And every night at sunset , little worms come burrowing out of my skin .
GUY DOCTOR: It 's just a sprain .
GUY PATIENT: That 's what I thought .
DAVE: A lot has been said about how guys do n't share their feelings .
KARLA E: You mean they have them ?
MIA: Or they have them and do n't acknowledge them .
LILA: Or they do n't think that others have them .
SIDRA: Or they just do n't think .
DAVE: ( as they agree on
THAT: Is it possible that they do have feelings , they do acknowledge them and they do know others have them - ut they just do n't express it the same way ? Four blank faces look at him . Then .
KARLA E: Sports . They have feelings about sports .
LILA: And their underwear .
POLLS THEM: You ever try and throw out thei underwear ?
MIA: Once . I nearly lost my life .
SIDRA: They act like it 's so sacred . I 've seen pairs of briefs with holes in them larger than the leg holes . I tried to throw a pair out once ? And sneak it past him ? He went out into the garbage and found them . He said he could n't trust me after that .
KARLA E: Tell me what that 's all about .
SIDRA: I do n't even want to think about it .
DAVE: So you agree then , that guys at least have feelings .
MIA: They just waste them . That 's all .
ELAINE: Now remember . Gene 's dad is real sick . Kelly says he does n't talk about it . So see if you can draw him out .
ROGER: He already did talk about it .
ELAINE: Oh ? What did he say ?
ROGER: He said his dad is real sick . She gives him a look . Gets to the door .
ELAINE: Kelly 's boss is turning forty .
ROGER: So you 're giving her magazines ?
ELAINE: Just see if you can get him to talk .
ROGER: Galaxians . Far out
GENE: ( while Roger keeps
LOOKING: Can you believe the Yankees got Lupenza .
ROGER: They get everybody .
GENE: I know . They suck .
ROGER: I know .
GENE: I got to Level 24 of Arkanoids .
TURNS: You 're kidding . Gene shakes his head . He 's not . This is big .
ROGER: You 've seen the Evil Presence ? What 's it look like ?
DAVE: Believe it or not , ladies - that was sharing . And believe it or not , guys - so is
ELAINE: Well I do n't know . How do you think she feels about getting older ?
KELLY: I do n't know I know how I felt . How did you feel about it ?
ELAINE: How does anybody feel .
NODS: So you think she 'll want a smalle gathering ?
ELAINE: Well if we go that way , we know who to invite .
KELLY: But then who do we not invite .
ELAINE: Exactly . And how are they going to feel about that .
KELLY: So maybe we should make it a slightly larger gathering .
ELAINE: Depends on the food , I guess . I mean , if we go with a large gathering
KELLY: Exactly .
ELAINE: ( finds the right
MAGAZINE: I saw something earlier in here about low-fat hors d'oeuvres .
KELLY: Oh - I 've seen that one too . They open to the article , scanning it .
ELAINE: Hmm .
KELLY: Hmm .
ELAINE: You thinking what I 'm thinking ?
KELLY: That if we have low fat hors d'oeuvres she 'll think we noticed she 's gaining weight ?
ELAINE: Exactly .
CONSIDERS THAT: Maybe just blow it out , you know ? I mean it 's a party . Go with the high fat .
ELAINE: Thinking she wo n't think we 've noticed the weight gain .
KELLY: Unless she thinks that 's insensitive . You know , that we had n't noticed
ELAINE: Hmm
KELLY: How about medium fat hors d'oeuvres ?
ELAINE: And we could cut them into smalle pieces ?
THEN: She could think we were being cheap .
ELAINE: And how would she feel about that
GENE: That one has the GPS . With the screen that has maps of everything ?
ROGER: What about with the convertible .
GENE: It 's optional on the convertible . Unless you get the turbo , then it 's standard .
ROGER: Phil Wonkerman got the turbo .
GENE: No shitPhil got a Porsche ?
ROGER: Said it was his birthday present to himself .
IMPRESSED; THEN: When was his birthday .
ROGER: Beats me . Probably around the same time when he got the car .
GENE: No shit
THEN: Maybe we should get him something .
ROGER: He just got a Porsche .
GENE: Right .
ELAINE: Roger ?
DAVE: Roger met Elaine at a company event .
ELAINE: You 're kidding ! That was you ? At the Burger King ?
ROGER: I was in fourth grade .
ELAINE: I was too ! But my God , you remembered that ?
DAVE: She loved that he remembered that .
THEN: Of course , Elaine was the only one who knew that
ROGER: What .
ELAINE: Nothing
DAVE: Roger has no idea that this was a defining moment for her . Roger gets in . Fuzzy but not sure why .
ELAINE: Do you realize that , as of tonight , we 've been seeing each other fo exactly six months ? CAMERA HOLDS on her . She waits .
IT: Well hey - you know ? I 'm not so sure I want this kind of a elationship either . Sometimes I wish I had a little more space , so I 'd have time to think about whethe I really want us to keep going this way . I mean , where are we going ? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy ? Are we heading toward marriage ? Toward children ? Toward a lifetime together ? Am I ready for that level of commitment ? Do I really even know this person ?
CONSIDERS IT: More intimacymore commitment
AND THEN: and maybe what 's happening , is he 's sensing my reservations ?
TO ELAINE: You know what your problem is ? You 're too idealistic . You 're waiting fo some knight to come riding up on his white horse , when you 're sitting next to a perfectly good person , a person you enjoy being with , a person you truly do care about , a person who seems to truly care about you . A person who is in pain because of this self-centered , schoolgirl fantasy that you insist on clinging to .
ELAINE: Roger ?
STARTLED: What ?
ELAINE: Please do n't torture yourself like this . Maybe I should never have
BREAKING DOWN: Oh God , I feel so
ELAINE: I 'm such a fool . I mean I know there 's no knight . I really know that . It 's silly . There 's no knight , and there 's no horse .
ROGER: There 's no horse ?
ELAINE: You think I 'm a fool , do n't you ?
ROGER: ( reacting to the Oval
ELAINE: It 's just.. .well I need time , I think . I think I need some time .
ROGER: Time . Yes .
ELAINE: ( moved , touches his
HAND: Oh Roger , do you really feel that way ?
ROGER: What way ?
ELAINE: About time . Do you feel that way about time ?
ROGER: Oh . Well . Yes . Yes I do , feel that way . About time .
MELTS: Thank you , Roger .
ROGER: Thank you .
BLAINE: Come on , Kelly pick up .
ROGER: Hey , Ref - look alive . Those guys were offsides .
KELLY: .and you said 'there 's no knight . '
NODS: - and no horse .
KELLY: Did you say 'no knight and no horse , ' or 'no horse and no knight ? ' She looks at Elaine.. This is crucial .
ELAINE: I said 'no knight . ' And then I said 'no horse . '
THEN: I know he agreed to the knight .
KELLY: But maybe not the horse .
ELAINE: Really it .
KELLY: Does he know it ? Elaine looks up ; she has no idea .
ROGER: Check . .who passes it right back .
GENE: Check .
ROGER: Listen .
GENE: What .
ROGER: Elaine and I .
GENE: Elaine and you what .
ROGER: We sort of have this thing .
GENE: Who .
ROGER: Elaine . She ever talk about horses ? Like , to Kelly or something ?
GENE: Not that I know of . Why ?
ROGER: What 's the score .
GENE: We have n't started yet .
DAVE: Roger 's in love .
SHERYL CROW: I can sympathize with your friend , man . I 've seen a lot of guys go there .
DAVE: Do you have any advice for a guy in love ?
SHERYL CROW: I do n't know - most of my songs are about guys out of love .
DAVE: I see .
SHERYL CROW: Cause you know , a guy in love - a guy who 's where your friend 's at , anyway - they do n't know where they are . They 're like an ant , standing on a truck tire . They do n't know how they got there - all they know is that 's not where they were a minute ago . But then they sort of get vaguely okay with it , you know ? They start hangin ' out there , they 're feelin ' pretty good .
THEN: Until the thing starts moving .
DAVE: What happens then .
SHERYL CROW: Well then they get crushed . Dave gulps . She shrugs .
OLD MAN: November 8 , 1960 . The day John Kennedy beat Nixon and won the White House . That was the day I met her . His WIFE turns , looks at him funny .
WIFE: You were wearing a yellow sun dress and there was a smudge of makeup just over your left eye . He smiles at her . Gets a thin smile back .
OLD MAN: What .
OLD LADY: That was n't me .
OLD MAN: Of course it was you . What are you talking about ?
OLD LADY: It was your first wife .
OLD MAN: Nonsense .
TO CAMERA: We met in Sacramento . Eight and a half years ago .
OLD MAN: Do n't believe her .
OLD LADY: I 've never owned a yellow sun dress in my life . And even if I did , I would n't be wearing it in November .
OLD MAN: The point is , in 1960 an Irish Catholic could be elected president of this fine country , as long as his father was a filthy rich rum-runne with connections to the Mafia ! And when Nixon did get elected , he had to quit ! His wife shakes her head .
KELLY: Well we did n't know each other . I mean , of course we did n't - we had n't met yet . But we were both invited to the same party , by different people who we only knew marginally - only the party got cancelled , and I guess that 's how marginal we were , because no one told us . So we came in different cars and found ourselves at the same front door - with no one home . So Gene asked me out to eat .
GENE: I was hungry .
KELLY: You were in love . You told me you loved me , that first night !
GENE: I said I loved mashed potatoes .
KELLY: You were eating mashed potatoes . You said you loved me . You said ecause your name was Gene and mine was Kelly , that that just proved it . We were meant to be together .
GENE: ( off her look ; then
TO CAMERA: Does this have to go in the movie ?
DAVE: Contrary to what many women believe , it 's fairly easy to develop a long term , stable , intimate and mutually fulfilling relationship with a guy . As long as this is the guy
JERSEY GIRL: What I do n't get is how they can be a fully grown adult male and not be able to make a commitment to a woman who loves him like no one else - and yet the same person , at age seven , could make an unbreakable lifelong commitment to the San Francisco Giants , who do not even know him and who never will . I just do n't get it .
SEATTLE GIRL: They 're never `` ready . '' If you ask me , guys are in a permanent state of nonreadiness . That 's where they live . If guys were turkey breasts , you could put one in a 350 degree oven on the Fourth of July and they still would n't be ready in time fo Thanksgiving .
CHICAGO GIRL: The thing is , you should n't even think about marrying them until you eally know them . But you ca n't eally know them until you marry them . That 's the thing .
MANHATTAN GIRL: One A guy will have sex with anything . Two A guy will do anything to have sex . There 's you Guy Fidelity . Move on .
ELAINE: What do you mean , it 's 'supposed to e that way . ' It 's stuck .
ROGER: It 's basic physics , Elaine . Wood expands . And then , later , it contracts .
ELAINE: But we ca n't get out .
ROGER: Which also means other people ca n't get in . That 's part of the design - it discourages burglars .
ELAINE: The same way the toaster was designed to discourage carbohydrate consumption y bursting into flames ?
ROGER: That was an outdoor toaster . It was clearly not designed for indoo situations .
DAVE: I think it 's obvious here , that Roge has absolutely no idea what he 's talking about . But Guy Pride forces him to keep acting like he does know , for reasons I believe we 've covered in an earlier scene .
ELAINE: Okay . So now we have a broken wate heater and a stuck front door .
THEN: I think it 's time to call Steve .
ROGER: `` Steve . ''
DAVE: As far as women are concerned , God did n't really rest on the seventh day . On the seventh day , God created Steve . As the Women all sigh
ELAINE: Roger ? Did you find anything ?
ROGER: Good news , honey ! The basement 's level .
ELAINE: How can you tell ?
ROGER: Because I know a well built floo when I see one ! We were right to uy this house . Everything works just the way it should !
ELAINE: Except there 's no hot water .
ROGER: Sweetheart , do n't you remember ? The power company talked about this .
ELAINE: How about calling Steve .
HATES THIS: We 'll call `` Steve , '' when we have a eal problem . Okay ? A mouse gets the hiccups , you do n't have to call Steve every time .
ELAINE: But Roger you 're such a good copy editor . You do n't have to be a good epairman too ! Honest !
ROGER: Okay I think I found it .
ELAINE: The problem ?
ROGER: The water heater . Elaine leans her head against the door jam .
ELAINE: I do n't know why he does this . He does n't know what he 's doing down there
KELLY: It 'll be all right .
ELAINE: It 's not like some broken part is just going to be standing there , waving a flag that says `` Help me . '' Or there 'll be an octopus on the compressor , and then he could say , `` Look ! There 's an octopus on the compressor ! ''
THEN: Of course , how would he know it was the compressor
KELLY: Trust me , it 'll all work out . Afte a while , there 's no more harm they can do .
ROGER: I just need to go to the hardware store . Hi Kelly .
ELAINE: And what is it about the hardware store ? All they do in there is buy a bunch of tools that they do n't know how to use and no matte what the problem is , all they 'll end up doing is whacking at it with a hammer until it breaks even more .
KELLY: And then they cover it all up with duct tape and then come out and say it 's supposed to work that way .
SOLIDARITY NOD: Then we have to call Steve . And they get offended .
ROGER: Let me tell you something . If I had a dollar for every time I heard `` Steve 's '' name , I could hire somebody etter than Steve , just to shake things up . Get her one of these old semi-retired guys - someone from the pre-steroid days , with the hairy shoulders , and the butt crack . They wo n't be so quick to call him every ten minutes .
CLERK: Remember . Keep these away from anything magnetic .
WINKS: Got it .
ROGER: The thing is - I missed out . It 's like everyone else was there the day they taught all this stuff . How to look inside acar.Or a furnace . Or a rocketship.But the guys like Steve , youknow.They were born knowing allthis- and now they 're laughing .
ELAINE: I 'm sorry - the door 's stuck .
STEVE: I can fix that .
ROGER: Should I bring these ?
STEVE: That wo n't be ( then as all the parts
FALL OUT: necessary .
LOOKS DOWN: The latch broke .
STEVE: I can fix that . Roger puts the tool kit down . Joins Steve .
ROGER: I was afraid of that .
STEVE: What you got ta do is jack up you laminate bolts and remove the calcification on the stress points .
ROGER: ( while Steve takes
SOME MEASUREMENTS: Of course when he says `` you , '' he does n't mean `` me . '' I do n't have jacks . I do n't have winches . And Steve has got like fifty kinds of each , right on his truck . If society collapsed , the Steves of the world will be living in nice sturdy shelters that they uilt with their own hands , eating food that they grew or caught . And I 'll be getting shredded to death by wolverines .
STEVE: Here we go .
KID: Dad , look ! Look what Steve made me ! A working battleship made entirely out of Coke cans !
ROGER: Do we have a kid ?
ELAINE: Steve got him from the truck .
DAVE: Just because Steve can fix things , does n't mean he 's shallow and does n't have any concerns . All guys have concerns . Deep concerns .
LOOKS OVER: You like SportsTalk ? Mike the Moose ?
DAVE: Hell yeah . Steve gives him a look . Turns on the radio .
CALLER: I 'm just sayin ' those owners bette never run into me . Because God help 'em , man .
ON TAPE: The guy was a workhorse ! He filled in wherever he was needed and he never got hurt ! And when he got hurt , he played hurt .
CALLER: Grocery the guy batted 340 , from oth sides .
ON RADIO: You just have to move on , Stan .
CALLER: .I try to - I 'm trying . But I just ca n't make sense of this Mike the Moose stops the tape .
DAVE: Meaningless ? Mike the Moose looks at him .
TV ANNOUNCER: .seventy-seven per cent from the line during the regular season , and a red-hot eighty-three per cent during the playoffs .
ROGER: Stop saying that !
GENE: Stop saying that !
TV ANNOUNCER: So they really picked the wrong guy to foul , at this crucial point in such a crucial game .
ROGER: Come on come on come on comeoncomeon
GENE: Miss the shot miss the shot miss the shot come on and miss the shot
TV ANNOUNCER: and the Knicks call time out .
ELAINE: They do n't know the players . The players do n't know them - yet they idolize these people . They follow them from team to team and they know more about these teams than they know about their own families . They might not even know if they have families .
KELLY: Not during the playoffs anyway .
ELAINE: And what gets me is , they think - they really think - that whether a team wins or loses or not depends on how much they personally care about them . Like if they do n't care , the team ca n't win .
DAVE: But that 's true . They look over - see him on the counter .
ELAINE: What 's true .
DAVE: It 's true that the level of concern a guy shows for his team can affect the outcome of the game . I mean not just one guy - but lots of guys . All the guys who care about the team combined , if they really care , can make a difference on the scoreboard .
ELAINE: That 's crazy .
KELLY: Who is he ?
DAVE: Follow me .
TV ANNOUNCER: He setshe takes the shotit 's
ROGER: Come on come on come on -
GENE: Miss the shot miss the shot miss the
TV ANNOUNCER: and he misses ! He misses ! It ounces off the rim and Miami wins the game ! What a comeback ! A field day for the Heat !
ELAINE: Let 's get back to those invitations .
KELLY: I 'm with you .
DAVE: If there 's one thing women do n't know about when it comes to guys , it 's the public rest room problem . And we 're here to clear that up right now .
DAVE: I see .
DAVE: With me now is the great John Madden legendary coach of football 's Oakland Raiders and veteran network analyst for CBS Sports and now the Fox Sports Network . John , thanks for coming by today .
JOHN MADDEN: Happy to be here Dave .
DAVE: John , you heard what our leading expert said about this particula anxiety that guys have regarding athrooms in general and public ones in particular . Any thoughts ?
JOHN MADDEN: Well he 's exactly right , Dave . I mean the guy was a little loopy but he hit the nail on the head .
DAVE: So an airport bathroom presents a specific kind of challenge .
JOHN MADDEN: The worst kind , Dave , and in a lotta ways . Because a guy 's main goal is to get in and outta there without having to deal in any other way with any other guy - and in an airport athroom especially , with the turnove ate they 've got , he 's up against some pretty mean odds .
DAVE: Could n't agree more , John . Let 's go
JOHN MADDEN: Okay . Now this angle here , we 're outside the bathroom and the maintenance guy 's just about to open it up .
DAVE: Here 's our first candidate now
JOHN MADDEN: Okay now the leadoff guy , he 's gon na come in , he 's gon na see the open field and he 's gon na swing wide right to grab a spot against the wall . He 's got one flank covered this way and for now he 's feelin ' pretty good and of course by doin ' that , he 's also settin ' the tone for everything that happens after . • . 68 .
DAVE: What 's the main thing we 're looking for , John . What does each individual guy feel he needs to get out of this .
JOHN MADDEN: Well the crucial thing here , is makin ' sure there 's no eye contact . I mean none - zero . These guys 'll look up , they 'll look down , they 'll look straight ahead but a guy would ather have you poke both his eyes out with burning hot fire tongs , Dave , than to give the next guy ove a reason to think you might be lookin ' at him in a public bathroom . Fo easons that oughtta be pretty darn obvious .
DAVE: Obvious indeed . Now here comes Guy Number Two
JOHN MADDEN: Now Guy Number Two , what he 's gon na do is , he 's gon na come in , see the first guy in position along the wall and right away he 's gon na line up wide on the opposite side . This is a best case scenario here , something oth these guys can appreciate . Plus they 've opened up the middle for the third guy
DAVE: What about eye contact in this situation .
JOHN MADDEN: Well you 're still not likely to encounter any , but again if you do , that 's what that buffer zone on eithe side of him 's for . And all three of 'em are feelin ' pretty lucky to have it , I can tell you that .
DAVE: Okay . Now if things stay like this
JOHN MADDEN: If things stay like this , you 're fine - and if this were some small commuter airport , y'know late at night or somethin ' , then these guys could possibly even be home free . But we 're talkin ' Miami International here , this is the big time , we 're talking about 747 's , DC-10 's , the ig jumbo jets dumpin ' off three- four hundred people at a clip . So everybody 's gon na be next to somebody , which is the last thing any of these guys want . You 're in a critical mass situation , and this is where a lotta mistakes get made .
DAVE: Which brings us to Guy Number Four . Here he comes
JOHN MADDEN: and there he goes
DAVE: Now one thing that I know we 're going to get asked , John , especially from women , is whether , as guys , we 're aware of how utterly stupid this kind of behavior really is .
JOHN MADDEN: Well I think we know , Dave . Do n't you think we know ?
DAVE: I think we do .
NODS: Have to be stupid not to .
DAVE: If there 's anything that causes more anguish in a guy than sports anguish , and public restroom anguish , and hardware store anguish , it 's the day that he realizes that somehow his life is half over now , and no matte what he tries to tell himself , he 's not young anymore and he 's neve going to be young again . And as any guy 'll tell you - it sucks .
ELEVATOR GUY: I got used to having the Beatles and Stones called 'classic rock . ' Then I heard Elvis Costello on an Oldies station . I figured , okay - who cares - at least it 's on somewhere . But then I hear `` London Calling , '' on Muzak . By the Clash . On Muzak .
SHRUGS: But what the hell . I 'm in a suit and I go around all day explaining peoples ' 401K plans to them . And Sting 's doing commercials for Jaguar . He shakes his head ; it 's hopeless .
BARBER: The way I see it , it 's like menopause , ight ? Except men get it different . It does n't show , y'see ? The cramps do n't come , the hot and cold flashes , and you do n't have your magazines and drug stores filled with helpful stuff to do about it . But something comes , and it hits every guy who 's living whether he likes it or not . Whether he knows it or not . Guy can lose his bleepin ' mind if he does n't watch out .
BARTENDER: I 'm just telling you what I see . Every lousy day . A guy 'll come in and sit down , right where you are . He loosens up a little and then it comes . The road not taken . Unexamined choices . An unfulfilled life . And other guys , they 'll come in and do n't say a word . The ones who just stare at the mirror .
DAVE: That sounds pretty bleak .
SHRUGS; THEN: I think it goes back to the old times . Ancient times , you know ? When nobody was expected to live past forty . You got to forty ? You died .
LAWYER: .therefore please be advised that in reference to the aforementioned subject matter , as per the original agreement dated 7 March Two Thousand , His Secretary stops writing . Waits .
SECRETARY: Um . You said that already .
LAWYER: I started here on the 7th of March . Fifteen years ago
SECRETARY: Oh . Well - Happy Anni
LAWYER: What the hell am I doing . Why did I even think this would be a good idea to work my ass off every single day of my life ? So I could come in here and dictate letters like this ?
SECRETARY: They 're not all like this . You do a lot of good
LAWYER: And what does it get me a twin- turbo convertible that I do n't even get to drive , because I 'm always traveling and renting shitbox cars in other cities where all I do is take clients out to lunch and tell them how to negotiate their golden parachutes ? You ever sit in the driver 's seat of one of those renta cars ?
SECRETARY: Well my husband usually does the
LAWYER: Brand new cars , not even two thousand miles on them , and already they drive like camels . The seat 's got no cushion left already , and you 're lucky if you do n't need a chiropracto after twenty minutes in one . What do people do in those things ?
SECRETARY: Maybe I could get you something . You want something ?
LAWYER: Yeah . I want something . I want the number of that hang-gliding place out on Route 33 .
SECRETARY: You want to go hang gliding ?
LAWYER: I want to teach hang gliding .
SECRETARY: I 'm sorry . I did n't know you did that .
LAWYER: I do n't do that . I want to do that . I 've always wanted to do that , and lots of other things too only I 'm stuck doing this all day long . And I do n't even know what this is half the time , just that I have to spend every waking hour doing it . So you tell me where the hell does hang gliding fit into that .
SECRETARY: Um . Saturdays ?
LAWYER: Give me a break .
SECRETARY: Where are you going ?
LAWYER: I should have done this a long time ago .
SECRETARY: What about the letter ?
LAWYER: Put in the usual bullshit . Nobody 's gon na read it anyway . He 's gone . She sits there .
JOHNNY LAKE: Sorry . We 're closed .
LAWYER: It 's two thirty in the afternoon .
JOHNNY LAKE: Hey . I do n't make the rules .
LAWYER: Are n't you the owner ?
JOHNNY LAKE: You 're right . I do make the rules . We 're closed .
LAWYER: Look , there has to I really want to learn this I just quit my jo to learn this .
JOHNNY LAKE: Be my guest - learn it .
LAWYER: How can you do this ? This is the perfect job !
JOHNNY LAKE: Yeah right . Driving around in a usted worthless pickup truck that 's about to be repossessed anyway , while a guy like you , my own age , is going around in a Porsche Carrera .
LAWYER: But you get to fly .
JOHNNY LAKE: No , you get to fly . I get to hoof this shit up and down these godforsaken hilltops listening to stockbrokers brag about getting lap dances from college coeds , and charging the whole thing through the company expense account while I ca n't even deduct my blood pressure medication . That 's what I get to do .
LAWYER: Look at this .
JOHNNY LAKE: You got that right . The Lawyer shakes his head ; flips the page .
LAWYER: What .
JOHNNY LAKE: You know . Have to use the
LAWYER: Glove ? You hurt your knee . He already took the x-rays .
JOHNNY LAKE: What if something 's broken .
LAWYER: Well he 's not going in that way . You do n't do a rectal to set a guy 's leg .
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON: Well you 've done quite a number on yourself . Want to see ?
JOHNNY LAKE: Why should I. I would n't know what the hell I 'm looking at . You 're the one who went to medical school .
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON: Do n't remind me . What . You think I like this ?
LAWYER: Well.. .are n't you ?
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON: Of courseIam - I 'm an orthopedic surgeon ! Ijust do n't like people assumingit !
GOESOFF: And this I am so sick of this loody thing I ca n't even tell you ! Because every time it goes off it means I have to stop doing one thing I do n't want to be doing , and start doing another thing I do n't want to e doing . You call that a life ? They look at him . Do n't know what to say .
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON: Let me show you something . I 've been working on this during my free time . Not like I get any .
JOHNNY LAKE: What is it ?
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON: What is it ? It 's a screenplay ! This 'll blow the lid off the orthopedic surgery industry ! Look - look here ( takes it back ; flips
THROUGH: no wait , this part 's better . No here ! Here you go . Read this and tell me if you do n't
DAVE: Okay ! Well it looks like it 's time to talk about sex .
MAGAZINE: Euphemisms .
DAVE: when I say `` euphemisms , '' I of course am not suggesting that guys do n't have them . Guys have plenty of euphemisms . Most guys have more euphemisms in a single day - and here I am thinking of a day that occurred in the summer between ninth and tenth grades - than some women have in a lifetime - or longer , in the case of certain Math Teachers .
THEN STOPPING: Naturally , it fell to guys to do something about this . So , naturally - they did .
DAVE: one technique for holding back the inevitable , is when the guy - just when he is about to have his euphemism - will hurl himself violently into an iron bed railing , and raise a lump on his head the size of a golf ball .
GENE: There 's nothing there !
DAVE: In cases where there are n't any iron ailings , a good backup technique can be found right on the end of the cold wet nose of the trusted family dog . CAMERA PANS to the window where we hear
KELLY: Yesyes
GENE: .yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes
KELLY: .just hold onyes
GENE: .yesyesyesyesYEEE00000WWWW ! ! ! CAMERA PANS back to Dave .
DAVE: There are also mental techniques
ROGER: Oh - yeah hi .
ACKNOWLEDGES CAMERA;: then to Dave ) Well , the baseball thing . I mean a while ago I was into that - big time . You know , fooling around with different lineups , mixing up the atting order - like thinking about what would happen if you took you cleanup guy and made him eighth o something just something stupid like that , you know ? Stuff you 'd never really do .
DAVE: And that did the trick .
ROGER: Oh hell yeah . I mean I could go all night - literally all night - just shuffling my pitching staff around , or thinking about who I might try and sign at the winter meetings . Hang on
CAN'T DISAGREE: So what do you do instead ?
ROGER: Math problems .
DAVE: Really ? You mean like if a train leaves Chicago at one o'clock and anothe train leaves Denver at two o'clock and they 're going at different speeds ?
ROGER: I ca n't do train ones . I always end up imagining this beautiful girl on the train - and it makes things even worse . Elaine stops . Pops her head out .
ELAINE: what beautiful girl .
ROGER: You , Elaine . The girl on the train is always you .
ELAINE: Oh , Roger
DAVE: As you can see , a lot of guys are making a tremendous effort here - and yet , according to certain standards they are still , basically , lame as hell on almost every single count . The reason for this is simple women set the standards . And not just bedroom standards all standards . Because women invented standards . Remember the Dawn of Guys ?
SUBTITLED: That 's it .
PRIMATE ELAINE: I 've been thinking . We need some standards around here .
PRIMATE KELLY: What are standards ?
PRIMATE ELAINE: Standards are like rules . Things they 'll have to do . And things they 'll have to stop doing .
PRIMATE KELLY: How about `` no leaving your dirty smelly loincloths wherever you feel like it , and expecting me to do something about it ? '' Can that be a standard ?
PRIMATE ELAINE: That can be one of the first .
PRIMATE LUCY: How ? They 're stronger than we are .
PRIMATE KELLY: They smell stronger maybe .
PRIMATE LUCY: Of the men , or the rotten fish ?
PRIMATE KELLY: There 's a difference ?
PRIMATE ELAINE: We 'll give them a Look .
PRIMATE LUCY: A look ?
PRIMATE ELAINE: A special look . A 'Certain Look . '
PRIMATE KELLY: But we look at them every day . And they still do whatever they want .
PRIMATE ELAINE: I 've been working on this . Watch .
PRIMATE GENE: What are you doing later .
PRIMATE ROGER: I do n't know . Probably just stare at the fire .
PRIMATE GENE: A bunch of us are going over to Primate Blonde Woman 's cave to see what she does with those gourds . Want to come ?
PRIMATE ROGER: Ca n't . Primate Elaine 's ancestors are still here .
PRIMATE GENE: Bummer .
PRIMATE ROGER: Tell me about it .
THEN: They are so Ice Age
PRIMATE ELAINE: I do n't get it . What was wrong with the other one .
PRIMATE ROGER: This one 's better . It 's an upgrade .
MUTTERS: Boy he must have seen this one coming
PRIMATE ELAINE: Dad . I just wanted to know what the difference is between this one and the one you had . You were so excited about it when you got it , and now you 've gotten rid of it and the only difference I can see is where this one has these markings painted on .
PRIMATE ROGER: Those make it so it travels better .
PRIMATE ELAINE: Painted on ? What 'd it cost you .
PRIMATE ROGER: Nothing . A couple wildebeeste steaks and handful of seeds of some kind .
PRIMATE ELAINE: Look . Just take it back . Please .
PRIMATE ROGER: But I ca n't do that ! All sales are final !
PRIMATE ELAINE: You can explain it to him . Tell him he can keep the steaks , but we want the seeds back .
PRIMATE ROGER: This is totally unreasonable !
THEN: Oh I get it . Do n't tell me it 's your time in the moon cycle again
PRIMATE ROGER: I 'll take it back . She smiles . FREEZE IMAGE .
DAVE: This is basically where we stand today . The only difference is , we have way more standards . There are social standards , about eing sensitive - remembering anniversaries , listening during conversations , not eating soup with your hands , or sitting around in your underwear when company 's over .
COLLEGE GENE: I know just what this place needs .
NODS: Hockey sticks . They turn around to go buy hockey sticks .
DAVE: of course , even by the most basic standards , these two are living like savages . But they honestly do n't know this because Guys , in thei natural state , are n't any more aware of domestic standards than a trout would be aware of the stock market . And this causes women a lot of concern .
SEATTLE GIRL: Take laundry . To him his clean clothes are ready when he 's ready to go get them . And they can dry the est of the way in the drawer . But they do n't dry the rest of the way in the drawer , they sit there in damp musty unfolded balls and he does n't even mind , and I ca n't figure that out . What is the matter with folding something ? What is the matte with waiting for it to be dry ?
DAVE: Laundry 's a big issue - and a deep and puzzling mystery to guys . My own wife Michelle , for instance , is an accomplished sportswriter and mother of an extremely young child , yet she is still able to maintain a vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen ordering on the super-human . And I 'm not allowed near the stuff .
MICHELLE: ( comes in with more
CLOTHES: He 's right .
DAVE: These are clearly secret codes , that women intuitively understand but can not adequately explain just like how a lot of guys understand the Infield Fly Rule , without being able to explain that .
MICHELLE: I can explain the Infield Fly Rule .
DAVE: Because you 're special , Sweetheart .
SIDRA: Sometimes I think they 're just like tapeworms . You know ? I mean tapeworms are just tapeworms - that 's all they are , and all they 'll eve e. They 're just these repulsive little parasitic beasts and nobody expects anything different from them - ecause people know that 's thei nature . And it 's the same way with guys - although a tapeworm 's more likely to help clean out the garage .
NODS: They have to be the biggest and they have to be the best . And they can never back down from a challenge . Ever .
KARLA E: They sleep with your sister and wonde what 's wrong with that .
MIA: They will make a game out of anything . A contest out of anything . Give them a grain of sand and they will figure out some game with it .
LILA: And they 'll argue over the rules .
KARLA E: They leave their dirty dishes everywhere . I ca n't believe the places I 'll find some crusted ove cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of God knows what in them . And the thing is , from his point of view ? They really do get cleaned by magic ! Because I ca n't take seeing them sit there , so I clean them .
SIDRA: I just get him to wash my car when that stuff happens .
KARLA E: Sweetheart he could wash my car with his tongue and it still would n't make up for where I find those dishes sometimes .
DAVE: So now that we 've heard your thoughts . The frustration , the exasperation the obvious question comes to mind Why go through it ? Why have guys in your life at all ? They look at him .
MIA: You mean as a choice ? You mean like a mature adult choice to have a guy in your life ? In spite of everything ?
SIDRA: Like trying to borrow money from you , after you 've broken up , so he can buy something for his new girlfriend ? And wondering what the problem was with that ? I mean like eally not knowing ? Dave looks at her . They all do . Until
LILA: I 'll tell you why . There is no good eason , that 's why . The others turn , look her way .
LISTEN CLOSER: But what a guy will do ? Is at eleven o'clock at night he 'll show up at your door and bring cheese steaks . And he does n't care that you look all rumply and dreadful from not expecting anyone . He might not even emember that you 're a vegetarian and do n't eat cheese steaks but that does n't really matter either . Because the point is he wanted one , and he ca n't come out and say it but he did n't want to eat it alone .
MIA: And you 're the person he thought of .
LILA: I ca n't tell you what that feels like , when they do that . I swear , if they knew how adorable they are sometimes , they 'd be dangerous . I mean more dangerous .
SIDRA: Bullshit . They 're tapeworms .
DAVE: I think it 's time for the conclusion now .
WHOAAAAAAAALII: Off he goes . . .right out of frame , and
JOHN MADDEN: Now these are the kinda end credits you like to see . You got the final update thing goin ' , where you find out how all the characters you 've een watchin ' are gon na turn out . You got good music , a lively kinda feel , and maybe most of all , the movie itself is n't too long
THE DEAD: y George A. Romero
WHO'S HE?: Roger HIS NAME 'S PETER . HE 'S ALRIGHT .
ISN'T IT?: IS N'T IT ?

CHICO: You got a boat .
ATTACKER #1: Shit , man . We can drift this tub into the aytow her around with a dinghybut she ai n't gon na get us nowhere . Ev'ry boat you see here is long dead , soldierelse we 'd be long gone . Can you get your boat ack here ?

MARIA: It wo n't happen to him ! It wo n't happen to him ! You heard his prayer . His prayer will save him . He could never become one ofone of those devils .
MIGUEL: Prayers have no power to save . The knife can save . It can cut the disease away . The ullet . It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed . These are savioursou new savioursour only saviours .
MARIA: We must wait . One day the curse will pass . One day a dead man will will
MIGUEL: One day a dead man will refuse to return , and that man will be a saint . The first saint of our century . That 's a prayer , too . A catechism . Something the priests tell us to believe .
MARIA: You can believe this , Miguel . I 'll kill you if you shoot . We must wait . I'll.I 'll do it.I 'll do it myself.when it needs to e done .

SARAH: No . No shooting . Not until we 're sure we 're alone on this island .
MIGUEL: No . No , thank you . No ice . Straight up , please . No ice . Thank you .

SARAH: Look .
CHICO: What do we do ? Let'em know we 're here.o what ?
SARAH: Let 's just.wait a minute . Get a bette look .
CHICO: It ca n't be . Are we truly in hell ?
SARAH: Come on .
RHODES: You 'll get used to this , Tyler . It 's the only way . They do n't bite the hand that feeds .
CHICO: NO ! NOOOOO ! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! ! !
RHODES: SPREAD OUT , MEN ! OPEN FIRE !
MIGUEL: BURN THE CHURCH ! KILL THE PRIEST !
CHICO: Yesyes , do itpleaseyou ca n't let me die this wayplease . Destroy me . A ulletin the headI do n't want to ecomeone ofone of them .

CHICO: Please.shoot me .
RHODES: And if I do n't ? If I do n't you 'll come back after your death . You 'll come back and find yourself hanging therewanting to eatneeding to eat human flesh . You hate that thought , do n't you ? That 's the ultimate sin for most of you fools , is n't it ?
CHICO: NONOOOOOOOSHOOT ME ! SHOOT ME ! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE ! ! !
RHODES: I 'll bargain with you . How many of you are on the island ?
CHICO: Two of usonly two of usmeand him .
RHODES: I do n't believe you , rebel . Where are you headquarters ? On the mainland ?
CHICO: The mainlandis deada dead placenobody there
RHODES: Where are your headquarters , rebel ? Tell me or I 'll let you hang there foreverFOREVER !
CHICO: There are noheadquarters . There are norebels . Only the walking dead . Do n't you see . They have won .
RHODES: Then why did you come here ?
CHICO: To looklook for a placea place to live inan empty placea newplace
RHODES: How did you know we were on this island ? Do others know ? Will others come ?
CHICO: Nooooo . Believe me . There are no othersno rebelsnobodyit 's overit 's ooooo . The man collapses , unconscious .
RHODES: Where are you going , Tyler ?
TOBY: My '' detail '' , sir . We 're going to bury the heads .
RHODES: No time for that . I 'll take care of them .
TOBY: Just.following procedure , sir . They 're entitled to burial .
RHODES: I said , I 'll take care of them . Just leave them there . Go help with the rest of the gear .
TOBY: Sir !
RHODES: You fired that shot , did n't you ?
TOBY: No , sir .
RHODES: Let me see your weapon .
TOBY: In the battle , sir .
RHODES: It may be that none of these chicken-shits will talk while the whole troop is presentbut I know some of these men well . I 'm sure that a few private conversations will tell me what I already know . You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag , Tyler . Cut him down . That 's another head for you to chop off . Leave it with the others . Take the rest of his body down to the freezers . Move it , shit hill . TOBY moves off . RHODES ' grin returns .
JOHN: It 's alright . It 's alright . Do n't be afraid . We 're friends .
SARAH: Gasparilla ?
JOHN: He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago . His name is bein ' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson .
SARAH: Governor Dickerson ? Of Florida ?
JOHN: That 's the man . He 's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan . Him and his family owned these islands 'round here . They was leasin ' this one to the Fed . The whole underneath is dug out . There was missiles here and laboratories and bom proof housing , nuclear power , all o ' that . Now this is Dickerson's.Gasparilla 's private fortress . Him and a bunch o ' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahasseeand his private army , of course .
SARAH: We ran up against a platoon of soldiers . There were actually walking deadin uniformwith guns .
JOHN: Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees . They could sting , sister . We know you came up against 'em . We been watchin ' you since you landed . Could n't help . I 'm sorry for that . We ai n't supposed to be outside . If we was spotted it could.well , it could be the end of everything .
SARAH: Thanks . I can fight my own battles .
JOHN: I know you can . Like I said , we been watchin ' you . McDERMOTT We better get as far away from here as we can . We can work the other side of the island tonight .
SARAH: The man I was withuntil today elieved that praying was for blind men who could n't see the truth .
JOHN: How we gon na break the curse without a prayer or two .
SARAH: Curse ?
JOHN: What is it if it ai n't a curse ?
SARAH: It 's a disease . It 's aa buga parasite that infects the brain .
JOHN: That sounds like a curse to me .
SARAH: We thought we were escaping here . We thought we 'd found an uninhabited island . Christ ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I 've seen yet !
JOHN: I 'm sure that 's true , miss . And that 's why we 're doin ' what we 're doin ' . What 's happenin ' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o ' man . But we 're gon na beat Lucifer . We 're gon na put an end to what 's happenin ' here .
SARAH: Oh , what did I run into ? A bunch o ' Jesus nuts ? Religiosos ? Prayer wo n't stop a ullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer wo n't keep one of those monsters from eatin ' your liver for lunch .
JOHN: That 's why we did n't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed . We ready to fight when we have to . And we got ta fight now .
SARAH: Look . I BEEN fightin ' , mister . I been fightin ' for what feels like a hundred years and I 'm finished . I do n't need eligion . I do n't need prayers . I need a couple guns and a couple hands . We can sail on outa here . Find another island where there ai n't so much.traffic .
JOHN: You think you can find your boat ? There 's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here . You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now ? You leave yourself a trail ?
SARAH: I can find it myself . I did n't come that far .
JOHN: Farther than you think . You 'll get lost . You will . And there 's Bees all through the jungle . I ai n't lyin ' to ya . Religiosos do n't lie .
SARAH: No . They just try to hold you for ransom . Fuck you , Moses ! I 'm outa here !
JOHN: We do n't need her guns that bad . Billy boy . McDERMOTT The hell we do n't ! But that 's not what I mean . She 'll be dead in ten minutes out there alone . That or she 'll be firin ' off her automatics and wakin ' up the troops .
SARAH: Are you gon na pause to say words over the dead this time or can we be on our way ?
GUARD: There 's activity in the dormitory !
MARY: This is Mary Henried . Did anyone enter the dormitory ? VOICE Yes , ma 'm . Captain Rhodes .
RHODES: Take it , friend . Take it . It 's a present . From me to you .
MARY: God.damn you , Rhodes !
RHODES: God has damned us all . Are my atrocities worse than yours ?
MARY: You have ruined weeks of work here ! We 've een trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat !
RHODES: No wonder they 're so.hungry .
JULIE: I did n't realise ! Those were de-caps ! I did n't know that.de-caps revived !
RHODES: Any dead whose brains are intact will evive .
JULIE: Butwe bury the heads . Oh . God ! It must e torture for them !
RHODES: They are brutes without feeling . Though I admit that I 've requested cremation fo myself . Burial is an archaic tradition , even more ridiculous now than it ever was . To say nothing of thespacing problemon a small island like this .
JULIE: I thought the purpose of decapitation was toto
RHODES: The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as muchfoodas possible . The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on ou side . The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit , not the primary goal . The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper . Keep them fed and they behave . Keep them hungry and they evert back to being the animals that they have always been . You saw them in there .
MARY: You gave them a fresh taste of blood !
RHODES: They will never be satisfied with anything else , Miss Henried . They want human flesh . I 'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they do n't get mine ! Not while I 'm still using it !
JULIE: Did you know ? About the de-caps ?
MARY: I 'd never seen it before .
JULIE: But you knew .
RHODES: You ca n't run away from the planet , Miss Science . You ca n't even run away from the island , heh heh .
MARY: Leave me alone , youCOCKSUCKER ! ! !
RHODES: And you 're the one who builds the bomb and they says , ' I hope it 'll never actually be used ' .
MARY: Julie Grant is a ehaviouralist . She 's not medical . She has n't been asexposed toto thingsas some of the rest of us . She 'll e alright . I 'll talk to her . She 'll be alright .
RHODES: Oh , I have no doubt .
MARY: If you put her on the shit list because of he eaction here tonight I 'll go to Dickerson .
RHODES: Ah , yes , our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately . I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice . The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat .
MARY: Rhodes , you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here . It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to , and which I never will repeat ! So give up , mister ! I 'm going hometo that roommate you mentioned . MARY pushes past RHODES into the hallway .
RHODES: Maybe you 'll change your mind when it starts getting too lonely for you .
MARY: You better not mess with me , Rhodes . I 'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch ! Think about it !
RHODES: No , Miss Science . You 're the one who needs to do some thinking .
MARY: Tobythank Godwait here . I got ta find out what 's goin ' on .
TOBY: Hey . Slow down . What is it ?
MARY: Some of Rhodes ' men . At the door .
TOBY: That bastard . I did n't think he 'd make his move so fast .
MARY: It 's because of me .
TOBY: Oh , bullshit , Mary . It 's because Rhodes is a prick .
MARY: I want you to leave . Then maybe
TOBY: We 're both gon na leave . Leave the island . I 've been talkin ' to Tricks . We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable afts . They 're crated up real small . They 've got air canisters . There 's food inside . Even a little motor .
MARY: I am nota guerilla fighter , Toby . I 'm not a pioneer . I 'm notI 'm not strong that way . I need
TOBY: Need what ? Civilised order like we have down here ? Christ !
MARY: I can work here . Maybe my work can helphelp everyone . I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland .
TOBY: For the good of mankind . That 's what every monster-maker says .
SOLDIER: You Tyler ?
TOBY: Yes .
SOLDIER: You 're under arrest . I 'll take your weapon .
MARY: What 's he supposed to have done ? What are the charges ?
SOLDIER: Dunno , ma 'm . We 're on orders .
MARY: LookI 'm Mary Henried . I 'm with the special conditioning center . I 'm not without influence
TOBY: Mary .
MARY: I 'll have somebody 's ass for this . I 'll have your ass , soldier . I 'm not gon na stand here and
TOBY: MARY ! She gives up . She looks into TOBY 'S eyes .
JOHN: The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag Seventeen . That 's where we live . That 's where you gon na live , too . Hell 's half acre . It 's not a nice place . Them boys there is prisoners . What 's thei punishment ? They sent out to the Stalag fo a few weeks . That 's punishment enough .
PREGNANT WOMAN: How 'bout it , baby . I 'm big but I 'm eautiful .
DRUNK: HEY , YOU FUCK ! YOU FUCK !
JOHN: This is home , darlin ' . Home for us that do n't make the grade . Us that ain'tgood enough to live inside The Cave . We grow a little food , do a little light manufacturin'like these here vests , we make these for the massers . We live in ou own filth , with bugs and snakes and disease and jungle feverall the time waitin ' to ecome breakfast for the Bees .
LUKEY: Doc Logan ! Doc Logan ! Dere 's a lady dead out dere ! Got ta hurry ! Got ta hurry ! Dunno how long she been dat way ! Maybe she gettin ' ready to come back .
LOGAN: Bury the head . Call the guard for the rest . Get it off the table for now . We 'll bring this new one in .
DIESEL: The tunnel .
LOGAN: God . It 's almost sun-up .
JOHN: It 's OK . It 's OK , Doc . She 's with us .
LOGAN: How do we know she 's alright ? How do we know ? McDERMOTT She 's alright . Christ , Rhodes and his cossacks wiped out her whole party . Dan near got her .
DIESEL: Are you alright , Doc ? You look you look eal bad .
LOGAN: I have looked bad for four years . Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years . Thank God looks do n't matter as much as they once did .
JOHN: This just ai n't your day , is it , darlin ' Sarah .
LOGAN: How do we know she 's alright ? How do we know ?
JOHN: They supply us with disinfectant and dope . Sex , drugs and rock-and-roll . What more could anyone ask for ? Most around here ai n't interested in changin ' their lives . The folks you metme and them and a couple others is the whole rebel army . Nobody else gives a shitand they 're afraid o ' Rhodes .
SARAH: They seem to be havin ' a good time . Some punishment .
JOHN: You disappear in here , darlin ' . You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in ye veins . You get lost out here and nobody 's gon na notice . Rhodes , he counts on that . It all makes for food in the freezers .
FISHER: Alright ! Way ta go , Kemosabe !
MARY: They wo n't learn to use forks if they do n't like the breakfast you 're serving , Ted .
FISHER: The fork is like a game to them . If they get into the game maybe they 'll learn to like the food .
MARY: It wo n't work .
TECHNICIAN: She should be in the behaviour rooms .
MARY: She 's not . Has n't shown up yet .
TECHNICIAN: I think he wants you to watch .
MARY: OK , Bub . Do your stuff .
JULIE: I do n't need any help from you !
MARY: JulieJULIE !
PROSECUTOR: He was found with a government-issue short- wave transmitter in his quarters . He 's charged with the theft of that equipment from a government installation and with possession of an illegal radio .
GASPARILLA: You always recommend the ultimate penalty , Tommy Lee . You and Rhodes .
PRISONER: WHY DO N'T YOU KILL ME ! I PREFER TO DIE ! I DO N'T WANT TO LIVE WITH WITH THIS KIND OFSIN !
GASPARILLA: WELL , PISS ON YOU , MISTER ! I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS ! YOU DAMN WELL BETTER NOT GO HOLLERIN ' LIKE THAT IN HERE !
PRISONER: I SPIT ON YOU ! THE ULTIMATE PENALTY FOR YOU ! BURN IN HELLFOR THE ULTIMATE SIN ! PIG ! ALL OF YOU ! PIGS !
GASPARILLA: Well , Miss Henried , what a coincidence . You 're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you . Guess you did n't care about the other proceedin 's we been dealin ' with here this mornin ' .
MARY: I 'm sorry . I wasbusy . In the lab .
GASPARILLA: Well , you managed ta make it here jus ' in time fer this case , did n't ya ?
RHODES: Sir . In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler , I do n't want to
MARY: Sir , Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State . Captain Rhodes is
GASPARILLA: Miss Henried , I think you better
MARY: Captain Rhodes is trying to
GASPARILLA: MISS HENRIED , SHUT THE HELL UP ! ! !
RHODES: I do n't want to take up a lot of time with this . Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against orders . There are eyewitnesses . I 've eprimanded Tyler and I 've had him sent outside . It 's as simple as that .
GASPARILLA: Ya had 'im sent ta the Stalag ? That 's all ya did to 'im ?
RHODES: The prisoner was dying , sir . Tyler acted out of a sense of mercy . I do n't believe Tyler to be dangerous , General . He just needsdiscipline . Two or three months outside will teach himdiscipline .
MARY: Sir . It 's quite clear that
GASPARILLA: SHUT UP , MISS HENRIED ! I TOL ' YA B'FORE !
MARY: THIS IS A TRAVESTY ! CAPTAIN RHODES IS
MARY: I 'm sorry , General , if Ispoke out of turn . It 's just thatM Tyler is not here to defend himself . He has no representation . I do n't believe due process is being served by
GASPARILLA: Listen , Missy . I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun ' tyere and one of the people doin ' the servin ' from now on is gon na be you . Now you been prancin ' aroun ' the Cave like yer ass was glass fe long enough ! All that 's
MARY: Tonight ?
GASPARILLA: That 's right . 'Bout eight , if that suits . We 'll start out in my gymnasium an ' progress on from thereto various othe forms o ' physical therapy .
MARY: We think there are other cities surviving . We think maybe Detroit there 's some signalling out of Philly .
GASPARILLA: There 's no place like this place . Warm climate . This facility . Christ , there ai n't nothin ' like this no-damn-where ! Even the Feds knew that . That 's why they stored so much o ' their shit down here . It 's all mine now . All mine . Just let 'em try ta come after us down here , which they will some daytake a likin ' ta what all we got an ' come after us . They 'll hafta get past my army ! An army that ai n't afraid ta dieha ha ha'cause it 's awreddy DAID ! HA HA HA
MARY: It 's not a very big army . And small as it is you wo n't be able to continue feeding it for very long . We 've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on
GASPARILLA: You 'll find the ways , Miss Mary . And when ya dowe 'll sail on over to the mainlandor any other damn mainland fe that matterand start us a recruitin ' program . There 's millions o ' Bees out there jus ' waitin ' fer ' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry !
RHODES: REVEILLE ! REVEILLE ! RISE AND SHINE !
SARAH: Let me go ! I 'm the one he wants . This is all happening because of me . If I turn myself in
JOHN: He 's just finding another reason fo umpin ' us off . Do n't ya see . He needs us ta die . He needs our bodies .
TOBY: It 's alright . I 'm a friend . I need help and so do you . What 's a safe place to talk ?
JOHN: Ai n't no place safe .
TOBY: LookI know you have no reason to trust me . I 've got friends in the Cave . I got some stuff comin ' out this mornin ' . I 'm gon na try to get off the island .
JOHN: The hospital ?
TOBY: Yeah . My stuff 's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey . Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in . Maybe we can find a place there to talk .
JOHN: Maybe .
TOBY: Hey , Tricks . Some detail they got you on .
TRICKS: Not as bad as yours , pal .
TOBY: What'dya get ?
TRICKS: Rafts . Two 38s . A little ammo .
TOBY: We need fuel , and a couple automatics .
TRICKS: Hey , you . Those two on the bottom . Do n't open those yet . They might be from the wrong shipment . Just keep 'em around 'til I can check .
LUKEY: Yessir . I never open 'em . Nossir . I keep 'em innaback for you .
DIESEL: He 's a spy . A spy for Rhodes .
JOHN: Give him a chance .
TOBY: He 's my contact for Chrissake ! There 's two crates . Can you get me into the hospital ?
JOHN: We got a boat .
TOBY: What ?
JOHN: I say we got a boat . Can you get othe stuff ?
TOBY: I got some fuel comin ' out and , I hope , some automatic rifles .
DIESEL: He 's just tryin ' to win us over . This does n't prove anything .
JOHN: I 'm gon na trust him , Diesel . He already knows who we are and we ai n't got a bunch o ' time to mess around with Rhodes shootin ' up the joint every mornin ' .
LOGAN: Take it away from me . Quickly . Take it ! Take it !
JOHN: You 're sick , Doc . You been sick for a while now . Too sick to be workin ' with us on this aid .
LOGAN: It 's my fight as much as yours . The things they made me dothe things they mademedo . I want so see Rhodes destroyed . I want to see all of them , all of them destroyed . It 's my dutyin the eyes of God . In the eyes of God .
TOBY: It wo n't work . That 's pure nitro you 're dealin ' with there . That stuff can blow if you look at is funny . What 're you gon na do , walk into the Cave carryin ' those tubes on feather pillows ? You do n't have a complete layout of the place . Even if you manage to avoid a fight you wo n't know where to go .
JOHN: We 're hopin ' you can show us where ta go , Toby .
TOBY: Oh , no . I 'm tryin ' to get off this island alive . I 'll help you all I can but I 'm not goin ' in there on a suicide mission . What can you hope to accomplish ? Some radios maybe ? A supply room or two ? You 'll all be killed and in a few weeks they 'll be back to business as usual . That place was built to withstand nuclear attack ! What are you gon na do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro ?
JOHN: We 're gon na blow up the powder magazine .
TOBY: What ?
JOHN: We know what 's down there . We did the loading ' and unloadin ' when the stuff came ashore in the early days . A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o ' damage .
TOBY: A direct hit 'll blow the top off this whole island ! How 're you gon na fuse the stuff ? How 're you gon na leave yourself time to get out ?
LOGAN: If we do n't get out it 's a small price to pay .
TOBY: You 're fuckin ' out of your minds ! There 's two hundred people down there . You gon na murder two hundred people ?
LOGAN: Sinners ! Animals ! Filth ! Doing the work of the Devil !
TOBY: What about the people here in the camp ? If they do n't get blown to kingdom come thei food 'll be destroyed , their water , medical supplies . They wo n't have any more power . This island ca n't support them all , they 'll e doomed . Count me out , friends . I 'm gon na get my ass outa here . Anybody wants to come along is welcome .
LOGAN: We know what we must do . It 's written fo us in the Bible . `` They shall be driven from the land of the living down to the world of the dead . That is the fate of those who care nothing for God . ''
SARAH: Toby 's right . They 're not gon na sit around with their fingers up their asses while we ust up their toys .
JOHN: Datura .
SARAH: What ?
JOHN: Datura Metel . The Devil 's Trumpet . Do n't worry . I ai n't goin ' religioso again . It 's a flower that grows on these islands . Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn . It 's toxic . Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject itorin a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system .
SARAH: Datura ! Miguel knew it ! Datura , he was shouting ! Datura Metel !
JOHN: We always planned to use it . We got some ground up alreadybut we could never find enough .
SARAH: There 's hundreds of 'em . Right where we landed our boat .
TOBY: This stuff really works ? No shit ?
JOHN: Quicker than gas . And it smells a lot prettier . It usually do n't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night 's sleep .
TOBY: If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up thei whole intercom system . Then , if you move fast enough , stay ahead of 'emwithout ein ' able to signal each other , they might have a hard time catchin ' you .
JOHN: I say it 's poetic . Pure calypso , brother . The Devil 's Trumpet blowin ' the notes o ' doom for the Devil 's troops . Ha ha ha ha ha
SARAH: Looks like just two . We can take 'em when the time comes .
JOHN: We 're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five .
TOBY: That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages .
JOHN: Come on . Let 's go . They move off stealthily .
TOBY: Maintenance shafts run behind all the main ooms . Nobody 's in those at night . You can use them to get around in . Hit the powe governors first . Kick a surge into thei computer network and you erase everything stored in the memory . Thenover in herethat 's where the cages are
LUKEY: I coulden stop 'em , boss . No way I coulda stop 'em , I sweah . They tie me up and stick dis they stick dis in my mouf . You b'lieve dis ?
TOBY: Jesus ! They 're gon na try to do it ! They 're goin ' in ! They got somebody to help 'em from the inside !
LUKEY: They din ' get da pistols . You know dem pistols you buddy send in widda raffs .
TOBY: I got ta get Mary out . Tricks . We got ta go now ! Tonight ! Right away ! McDERMOTT Oh , Lord !
SALLY: We 're not ready .
JOHN: Wellif ya think about itwe as ready as we ever gon na be . How was they carryin ' the nitro , Lukey ?
LUKEY: Oh , me . You ai n't gon na b'lieve dis , neider . You ai n't , I sweah . They put it inta Spidah 's body .

LUKEY: De Doc . He cut up Spidah here and here and hereall ovah . He stick dem tubes in dere , like undah da skinan ' den he sews 'em all up . I sweah . I sweah , sweah , sweah !
LOGAN: I know it hurts . But it wo n't be long . Then all the pain will be over . Oh , I wish you could hear me . GOD , GIVE HER THE EARS TO
DIESEL: Quiet !
LOGAN: Oh , yes . Quiet . Yes . We must be quiet .
TOBY: Okay . Lem me have 'em .
RADIO MAN: What 's that ? Smell it ?

JULIE: Do n't move !
YOUNG MAN: Hey ! What the hell.. ?

JULIE: Whatwhat have you done to her ?
LOGAN: God forgive us . Forgive us the pain we inflict as surgeons . We 'll be in Heaven , child . Soon . We 'll be with Him in Heaven .

ADA: Sweetheart , I care about you I love you I worry about you I ca n't help those feelings

REICHER: That was years ago According to these papers you are now just a helpe in the circus with little or no importance ! !
HELMUT: Some things are only temporary Lt. Reicher ! Only yesterday , I had calls from one of the great circus owners in all of Europe he
REICHER: You are NOTHING ! ! You are a HAS BEEN ! ! You WERE A CLOWN
HELMUT: No ! Lt. Reicher , I ca n't make anything funny from that thought
REICHER: It is no thought It is fact , Clown , unquestionable fact ! ! Now down to the issues at hand Did you willfully and with malice attack the State and impersonate the Fuhrer ?
HELMUT: I was drunk ! It was a mistake ! I meant no disrespect Sir Honestly , I was drunk and not esponsible for my actions and thoughts ! And my actions were subconscious !
REICHER: Subconscious ? ? Meaning it was all motivated by truth that came out under the influence of alcohol !
HELMUT: I am a LOYAL German !
REICHER: And what kind of commendation would you expect for being a loyal German ?
HELMUT: I want nothing ! But I 'm more loyal than most Germans I know

S.S. MAN: Move along you swine move we have n't got all day move move one-two-three-four
ADA: Go away ! !
GUARD: Tsk ! tsk ! tsk ! shame on you , Doork shame do n't you want to grow big and strong like me ?
HELMUT: I 've had enough , thank you No more , please The Guard just stares at him
GUARD: I 'm surprised at you , Doork , you 've een here two years now , you should have learned we , of the Third Reich , never acknowledge the weak , sniveling , egging of you swine that 's all you 're good for begging pleading praying you 're a disgrace to the human race . That 's why we of the superior race must do away with all of you
HELMUT: I would kill you but I am getting my release any day now and I wo n't do anything that would spoil my chances
GUARD: Your release ? He begins to laugh , but hysterically .
HELMUT: Dear God , please hear me !
KELTNER: He hears you , my son
HELMUT: You frightened me , Johann , I 'm sorry
KELTNER: You have nothing to be sorry for Fear is n't something controlled by man fear can not be conferred with there is n't anyway known to mankind where man can say to himself `` I will not be afraid '' Oh , certainly man can try to fight it but faith and believing are man 's only chance You must have faith you must !
HELMUT: I have faith but not always sometimes it eludes me I ca n't emember to remember it .
KELTNER: But that 's natural you ca n't expect to be perfect in what you try to do
HELMUT: I do n't know He starts pacing again .
KELTNER: I heard what happened at breakfast this morning with ROTHMAN , the guard Helmut spins around , frightened again
HELMUT: Will they do something to me ? What have you heard ?
KELTNER: Nothing , absolutely nothing do n't worry about it I just wanted you to know that I believe you handled yourself admirably
HELMUT: That was one time I did n't care fo the laughs I was getting from some of the men
KELTNER: Of course you did n't but I 'm sure you know man laughs for two reasons one because something is funny two , because they fear showing fear they laughed because `` there but fo the grace of God go I ! ''
HELMUT: Do you really think so ?
KELTNER: I 'm certain of it !
HELMUT: Thank you , Johann . I always feel so much better after you talk to me
KELTNER: I 'm glad , Helmut , I 'm very glad you know you can always talk to me , about anything
HELMUT: Oh ! I almost forgot
KELTNER: How many times since you 've been here , have you filled out forms ? Twenty ? Thirty times ? ?
HELMUT: But this is different . It 's entirely new .
KELTNER: Yes , my son , it is a good sign .
HELMUT: And I have to be very careful of everything I put down on the form . The tiniest detail could make the difference . Do n't you agree ?
KELTNER: Is n't it strange ? They are free to go anywhere they want , and they come here to nest .
HELMUT: I 'm sure I 've got everything here The important facts from the moment I was arrested , the questions the Gestapo officer asked me now what was his name again ? I ca n't seem to remember what his name was
KELTNER: HELMUT
HELMUT: What the devil was his name ?
KELTNER: You 're not a religious man , are you , Helmut ?
HELMUT: Well , I ah
KELTNER: Not sure I am myself anymore . Helmut quite surprised by this remark .
HELMUT: He should have sent them elsewhere they could be eaten here !
LUDWIG: I think we should eat it !
KELTNER: Not on your life Er , that is I would n't
FRANZ: Put it somewhere so it can brighten up the place .
LUDWIG: It would take a hell of a lot more than that to brighten up this place .
ADOLF: It 'll be better than looking at you long face .
KELTNER: Do you see the way it 's sprouting I told you it was n't completely otten .
HELMUT: That 's nice , Johann . Do you remembe when I filled out those last forms ? The date might be important .
KELTNER: About four weeks ago , I think .
KELTNER: I 'll put it up here on the window sill , it 'll get the morning sun .
STOUT PRISONER: Think you can trust your potato so close to me , Reverend ?
LUDWIG: The potato he TRUSTS it 's you he does n't trust !
GUARD: ATTENTION !
THE MEN: Got ta have more room We need more space Hey , watch where you 're going . This is stupid !
GUARD: YOU ! You down there at the end get those bunks right up against the wall .
STOUT PRISONER: Yeah , like triplets before they are orn to a mother weighing 98 pounds
HERMAN: That 's what I call cozy ! The guard smiles , and all the men laugh
HELMUT: Excuse me , sir , the papers Did they arrive yet ?
GUARD: They 'll have to wait !
HELMUT: You 'd think , since he was coming over here anyway , the least he could do was bring the papers with him .
KELTNER: This moving men around has undoubtedly kept him very busy do n't worry , he 'll bring them .
HELMUT: I 'm sure if I asked him again he 'd eally become annoyed with me . Would you remind him for me , please ?
KELTNER: Of course I will .
KELTNER: I 've seen you around the yard , but the others
HERMAN: Do you think they 're bringing in wa prisoners ?
LUDWIG: I do n't know why they 're sending them here we 're overcrowded as it is .
KELTNER: No , no it 's got to be something else Otherwise they would have left the bunks .
ADOLF: It could be possible that he is fixing up the barracks for some of his lady friends .
KELTNER: That many women ?
HERMAN: Reverend , we Germans are SUPERMEN !
GUARD: ATTENTION !
GALT: We might as well be outside .
UHLMANN: If I get pneumonia , I 'll hold the government responsible !
GUARD: With a little luck , you 'll both get pneumonia !
UHLMANN: It 's sure quiet in here
UHLMANN: Hey , Galt ! Come over and look at this !
GALT: What is it ?
UHLMANN: Ai n't it cute ?
GALT: It 's a God damn posie ! He and Uhlmann burst into laughter
UHLMANN: Looks kinda sick , does n't it ?
GALT: It 's one of them potato things and it sure as hell is sick !
UHLMANN: Maybe we should put it out of its misery .
GALT: No , we do n't want to do that we might break someone 's heart . He looks around at the other prisoners .
KELTNER: The plant is MINE !
GALT: Is it now ? Tell me precious do you knit , too ?
KELTNER: If necessary , I can and I do !
GALT: What do you think of that , Uhlmann he knits !
UHLMANN: Now , if he could just cook
GALT: Can you cook , sweetheart ?
KELTNER: If necessary , I can cook , yes ! Now , if you do n't mind , I 'll take that plant !
GALT: Alright , old man , you really want it ?
HELMUT: Why do n't you pick on someone you own size
GALT: What ?
HELMUT: You heard me ! Give him his plant ack , and leave him alone He did n't bother you and if you have to show your muscle , there 's plenty of other guys to pick on !
GALT: You 're my size !
HERMAN: Give it to him ! Galt looks at him with a menacing stare
ADOLF: You heard him give it to him !
FRANZ: You 've had your fun give it to him NOW !
GALT: Sure , here 's your stupid flower o whatever you call it Keltner takes it from him .
KELTNER: Thank you
GALT: What 's the matter with you guys ? Ca n't you take a joke ?
ADOLF: What joke ?
GALT: Hell , all I was doing was trying to have a little fun .
LUDWIG: Have it with someone else !
GALT: What 's so special about him ?
ADOLF: That 's the Reverend . Even when they came and dragged him from his church he kept right on preaching against them until they knocked him unconscious . Galt is silent for a beat .
GALT: Well , how the hell was I supposed to know ?
HERMAN: NOW you know !
GALT: You and your posies
UHLMANN: That was close
GALT: Where were you when I need you ?
UHLMANN: I make love , not war ! Hey , that 's pretty good I made that up Make love , not war ! I et that would make a good slogan someday
GALT: Aw , shut up ! And he smacks his legs up and onto the bunk .
KELTNER: That was really very nice of you , Helmut
HELMUT: Yeah , nice and STUPID !
GUARD: Come in !
HELMUT: If you 'll shut your stupid mouth maybe I can answer one of you questions !
GUARD: I have a STUPID MOUTH ?
HELMUT: I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to raise my voice
GUARD: The volume of your voice is n't the issue it 's what comes out of your mouth that disturbs me maybe you need a little lesson in respect and courtesy
HELMUT: I 'm sorry
GUARD: I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry You 're a sorry specimen of a human being that 's what you are
KELTNER: Helmut , Helmut , how could you think of doing such a thing ? I begged you not to irritate him and that I would ask him about your papers that was n't smart , Helmut not smart at all as a matter of fact
HELMUT: Leave me alone ! and mind you own business Just leave me be
GUARD: Reverend , let him sleep you move out , I 'll take care of this
GUARD: Doork ! Move it out , and on the double ! !
LUDWIG: It looks like Helmut found some new ears to listen to his Super Sta fantasies
HELMUT: So I told Mr. Ringling if he wanted `` Helmut '' he 'd have to bring his circus to Germany I am a German , I told him , and my responsibility is to my own people who are my biggest fans .
3RD PRISONER: Come on , let 's see what 's such fun
UHLMANN: Hey , Galt , it 's your turn , how about doin ' one of your belly dances fo us ?
GALT: Reverend ?
KELTNER: A little fun is what we need so if you 'll all hold the noise down , I 'll join in .
GALT: A clown ? Who 's a clown ? ?
HERMAN: You 've heard of `` Helmut Doork '' . That 's him down there !
LUDWIG: Do n't waste your time . You 'll neve get the Great Doork to do anything .
ADOLF: You 're wasting your time . He does n't perform for the likes of us he 'll turn you down .
LUDWIG: He 's right , we 've been asking him for three years I have a feeling he only does his little routines fo the crowned heads of Europe .
ADOLF: And , of course , the BIG heads of Berlin .
1ST PRISONER: How about it , Doork ?
HELMUT: I 'd like to , but I ca n't really I ca n't .
GALT: Ca n't ? Did I hear you say you ca n't ?
HELMUT: I 'd like to do something but He can tell you He 's seen me work I need props make-up I work with a lot of different things
GALT: Now , me and these gentlemen we do n't expect you to do your `` act '' , just a little something that 'll give us a laugh , that 's all .
LUDWIG: Aw , forget it and that 's probably his problem he 's forgotten how !
GALT: Wait a minute , you guys show people have to be in a mood Play a little music , like in a circus
HELMUT: I TOLD YOU ! I need things to do my act .
GALT: Yeah , that drunk thing that does sound funny
HELMUT: I still need many things props and
GALT: Hey are you trying to fool us ? With this Keltner moves in and up to Galt .
KELTNER: Leave him alone !
GALT: Stay out of this , Reverend . We 're not doing anything We just want him to join in the fun .
UHLMANN: Right ! If a Reverend can give us a laugh , why not a clown ?
KELTNER: It does n't have to be anything special a little dance , maybe ?
HELMUT: Like that disgusting exhibition you did ? Oh , no not me !
GALT: WE need you to give us a laugh .
KELTNER: That 's enough , leave him alone !

THE MEN: Choke him harder see if that 's funny ! Make him dance ! Hey , Doork ! e funny now ! He do n't look so funny to me ! He sure as hell looks funny to me ! Hey , Galt , pull his string and make the dummy funny !

HELMUT: I was just going to ask him about the forms my release
KELTNER: That was not the time , believe me !
HELMUT: No , I 'm alright thank you .
KELTNER: You 've never done anything for them !
HELMUT: You think I should have performed ?
KELTNER: The men would have appreciated it .
HELMUT: Johann !
KELTNER: What is it ?
HELMUT: They do n't believe me , do they ? I mean about being a clown ?
KELTNER: Oh , I 'd say you 've convinced most . However There is one you have n't convinced
UHLMANN: They 've put up barbed wire !
GALT: What the hell ?
STOUT PRISONER: Youngsters ! They 've got youngsters over there .
YOUNG PRISONER: Women !
ADOLF: Another fence !
HELMUT: What does it mean ? What do they need a fence for ?
KELTNER: Misery loves company . Looks like they 're going to deny us even that .
GUARD: All right . All right , move . Hurry it up . Move .
LOUDSPEAKER: Attention ! The Commandant issues the following special order the north side of the camp is now temporary quarters for non-Aryan prisoners . Fraternizing between Aryan and non-Aryan prisoners is strictly prohibited . Any violation of this order will be severely punished . Heil Hitler Repeating

HERMAN: Bastard !
STOUT PRISONER: I ca n't go without food . I 'll starve .
KELTNER: Helmut , do n't . But Helmut shakes him off and hurries away .
GALT: He 's the one we can thank for the diet .
HELMUT: Sir ? Corporal
GUARD: What ?
HELMUT: Doork . Helmut Doork . Remember ? The papers You said Remembe the special forms for the Gestapo to eview my case .
GUARD: No papers .
GALT: What 'd you say now , Mr. Doork , Almighty ! Last night he would n't give us a laugh . Today they wo n't give us food .
LUDWIG: What were you doing ? Making a deal with your guard pal to slip you some food ?
HELMUT: No ! I was asking him about the forms he 'd promised to get me . Because of last night I 'm not getting them .
KELTNER: When this blows over , Helmut , we 'll
LUDWIG: Do n't feel sorry for him . He 's got no one to blame but himself . The whole thing was his doing .
ADOLF: He 's been telling us how great he is ; how funny . Why ? Why could n't he have done a trick or two for us ?
UHLMANN: The Reverend did a turn . What 's so special about him ?
KELTNER: Do n't start anything here . We 're in enough trouble .
UHLMANN: We 're not starting anything , we 're finishing something .
GALT: We 've decided Doork here is going to keep us laughing so hard we wo n't be able to hear our stomachs growling .
STOUT PRISONER: Better hurry it up , clown . 'Cause my stomach 's growling already . Can you hear it ?
HERMAN: Hear it ! The whole place hears it .
MEN: Yeah , Doork , do a trick . How about that night in Munich when they would n't stop laughing . How about it , Doork ? Come on , just a little trick . Give us one laugh . That 's all we 're asking for . Come on , Helmut , do something .
FRANZ: He 's going to do it ! He 's going to do it !
HELMUT: Nothing pleases an artist more than to perform . I 'm going to do a real show for you . All I ask is that you give me a little time time to get things together things I can use as props I 'll even try to make a costume , and
ADOLF: You do n't need a costume . We 've got imagination .
TO MEN: Right ? Murmurs of agreement .
HERMAN: Do the drunk pretzel like the kid suggested last night .
GALT: And do it now , clown . No more stalling .
HELMUT: Let me through .
ADOLF: Are n't we good enough for you ?
LUDWIG: He 'd do his tricks fast enough if his guard pal asked him . Would n't you , Doork ?
KELTNER: Do something , Karl . For God 's sake , do something .
GALT: And be sure it 's funny .
HELMUT: All right all right .
MEN: If he 's Germany 's greatest clown , God help the Fatherland . Doork , the Great ! You got paid for that ? To go without food is bad enough , but to have to watch that !
UHLMANN: He 's no clown . Not even a bad one .
HELMUT: I am . I am a clown ! They move away from him .
ADOLF: That 's what we 've been eating ou hearts out to see ! You stink . You really stink .
HELMUT: I I slipped . I can do it .
GALT: Doork the Great .
HELMUT: Come back , damn you , come back . The children they 're laughing . They 're laughing . I am a clown . I am a clown .
BIG PRISONER: It 's my stomach that 's sensitive .
OLD PRISONER: Here comes your second helping .
HELMUT: Here .
BIG PRISONER: How 're the shoes ?
HELMUT: Perfect .
BIG PRISONER: Hey , Doork !
HELMUT: I had to fix them this way fo the act , you know . Wait till you see how funny it is .
BIG PRISONER: Yeah . But will I feel like laughing when it gets cold !
HELMUT: Do n't worry .
BIG PRISONER: Worry ! I 'm the one who 'll get frost itten toes , not you .
HELMUT: When I return them , they 'll be like new . I promise .
BIG PRISONER: For what you 've done to my shoes I should get more food .
OLD PRISONER: He 's got to have something to eat . The Big Prisoner looks at him questioningly .
BIG PRISONER: Remember you fix them before you ing 'em back .
HELMUT: Promise .
KELTNER: Do n't tell us . Tell him .
FRANZ: What am I supposed to do ? Use pins ?
HERMAN: Who has a pin ? Keltner chuckles .
FRANZ: You can laugh . He is n't always afte you for something .
KELTNER: No ?
FRANZ: What 's that ?
KELTNER: Chalk .
FRANZ: What for ?
HERMAN: Where 'd you get it ?
KELTNER: From a guard .
FRANZ: I wish he 'd have a heart and use someone else 's coat . Or better yet his own .
KELTNER: Ask him .
HELMUT: This will do more for the act than anything . Wait 'll you see !
KELTNER: For a moment there you had me worried .
FRANZ: I see you got smart .
HELMUT: His conscience bothered him .
KELTNER: I thought he would kill you when he saw what you had done to his shoes .
HELMUT: So did I . The men laugh .
FRANZ: I do n't know what I 'm laughing at look at what he 's doing to my coat . Look at it ! Yesterday a button off .
HELMUT: I 've got to have it . It is the only one I can get on and still is tight enough to look funny .
FRANZ: At the rate you are tearing it up , it 's going to look a lot funnier .
KELTNER: Give in , Franz . You know he 's going to talk you out of it again .
HELMUT: I 'll be careful . I swear . Besides , I 've got to have it . I explained efore a clown ca n't change his costume . It 's his trademark .
FRANZ: I know I know but
GALT: Why should he give it to a Jew clown ? Right , kid ?
FRANZ: That 's got nothing to do with it .
GALT: What 's the matter with you bastards anyway ? All he ever did for us was cause trouble , but for them he ca n't do enough . I say he 's one of them .
KELTNER: If he were , he 'd be over there
GALT: That 's where he belongs .
FRANZ: What 're you so hot about ? It 's no skin off your
UHLMANN: We 've got a good reason for not liking them .
GALT: If it was n't for them we would n't e in here .
HERMAN: What 'd you mean ?
UHLMANN: A bunch of them got picked up with papers we 'd sold them . And what 'd they do ? Turn us in , they did . The ungrateful
KELTNER: So that was it ! Counterfeit papers . I can imagine the prices .
GALT: Supply and demand , Reverend . Supply and demand . Deliberately , Franz hands his coat to Helmut .
FRANZ: Take it , Doork anytime you want it .
UHLMANN: What 's so terrible about what we did ? Lot of them got out of the country with our papers . They were damn good counterfeits .
GALT: And what 's more , we never charged for children . Never .
KELTNER: I 've been meaning to ask you . Heard anymore about the request for a review of your case ?
HELMUT: Did you hear the laughs I got yesterday ? Keltner nods .
KELTNER: Never thought of that .
HELMUT: They said I could n't come up with anything new . Keltner looks puzzled .
KELTNER: The children certainly enjoy it .
HELMUT: What I needed was time . Time to concentrate on new material . A man 's got to have time alone .
KELTNER: You call this being alone ?
HELMUT: Do you think maybe they 'd let me go to other camps and entertain ?
KELTNER: Who ? The adults ?
HELMUT: The children , of course .
KELTNER: I thought the smart clown only played to the adults .
AIDE: He 's coming back down the hall .
BESTLER: Heil Hitler .
SCHARFF: Yes , Colonel .
BESTLER: This is n't the first prison the SS has had to take over from the military . Military men are too soft to deal with those Scharff starts to speak but quickly changes his mind .
SCHARFF: Yes , sir .
BESTLER: You were about to say something ?
SCHARFF: Oh I was just going to say that I did n't hold with the soft treatment of the prisoners .
BESTLER: Good ! Our first order of business is to prepare
SCHARFF: Where are they being sent , Colonel ?
BESTLER: Work camps .
SCHARFF: But we have about 40 children , some only babies , with more scheduled to arrive tomorrow or the next day . They 're not going to be much use in a work camp .
BESTLER: I 'm aware of that . This order covers only the adult prisoners over fifteen . We wo n't have to wet nurse the children for long . Other plans are eing made for Again he is interrupted by the laughter o.s .
SCHARFF: That ! Well , you see , sir , one of the prisoners used to be a circus clown . Sometimes he gives a little well a sort of show for the children .
BESTLER: A show ! Is this a prison camp or a traveling circus ! Am I correct in assuming that those children are on the non-Aryan side of the camp ?
SCHARFF: Yes , sir .
BESTLER: And the buffoon ? A German ?
SCHARFF: Yes , Colonel .
BESTLER: Am I to believe you are n't aware of the general order absolutely forbidding fraternization ?
SCHARFF: I know about it , sir .
BESTLER: Close the window .
SCHARFF: Communication . Social contact . Giving aid , talking
BESTLER: How long has this been going on ?
SCHARFF: Just the last two or three weeks .
BESTLER: And the Commandant approved ?
SCHARFF: Well , sir , children are very hard to handle .
BESTLER: This clown ! Who is he ?
SCHARFF: It 's I know . It 's Doork , the Great .
BESTLER: Not his clown name , you idiot . His number . His identification .
SCHARFF: If I have the Colonel 's permission to leave , I will check it at once .
BESTLER: Later . Right now I want these performances halted . Understand ?
SCHARFF: Yes , sir .
BESTLER: Immediately !
SCHARFF: Yes , sir !
GUARD: That 's all . Show 's over . Everybody clear out . Helmut stops , startled .
HELMUT: What 's wrong ?
GUARD: Get back to the barrack . You heard me . Show 's over .
HELMUT: That 's all the show for today . Go ack inside .
GUARD: Get inside and take that stuff off your face .
HELMUT: I do n't understand . What 's the matter ?
GUARD: Orders . No more shows .
HELMUT: You mean not ever ?
GUARD: That 's right .
HELMUT: But we were n't doing any harm .
GUARD: The Commandant thinks you are .
HELMUT: The Commandant ?
GUARD: The new Commandant . He minds .
HELMUT: Just because I make them laugh a little
GUARD: You know the rule no mixing with Jews .
HELMUT: I was n't mixing ! I was only
GUARD: Look , it 's not my order . It 's the Commandant 's . Now do what I tell you and save yourself a lot of grief .
FRANZ: What happened ?
HELMUT: He says I 've got to stop with the children .
KELTNER: I 've been expecting it .
LUDWIG: Because they 're Jews ?
KELTNER: Because of the laughing .
HELMUT: Why should that bother them ?
KELTNER: When you rule by fear , laughter is the most frightening sound in the world .
HELMUT: I ca n't go out there . I ca n't take another day of them staring at me .
KELTNER: They 'll get over it . Disappointment is no stranger to those children .
HELMUT: They look at me as though it was all my fault . Have n't they been told why I ca n't
KELTNER: I 'm sure they have .
HELMUT: Then why do they stare ?
KELTNER: It 's amazing how a thing like this can feed off itself . Think how lucky we would be if we could do that .
HELMUT: I sewed a button on . Look all right ?
KELTNER: Fine .
HELMUT: I did make them laugh . Did n't I ? Keltner nods .
KELTNER: We 've been all over that before . You 've got to stop thinking about them .
HELMUT: You 're right ! I 've got to think of myself .
KELTNER: It 's too hot in here . I 'm going to get some air .
HELMUT: Johann do you think there 's any possible way I could talk to the Commandant . Maybe I could make him understand
KELTNER: There 's nothing you can do but forget .
HELMUT: How can I ! They were my own very special audience . And now they stare at me as if I had betrayed them .
KELTNER: They 're children , Helmut . You ca n't expect them to understand the madness of adults .
HELMUT: If I could talk to them . To the children themselves that would help , would n't it ?
KELTNER: You go near that fence once again and you 're taking your life in you own hands . You know that as well as I do .
HELMUT: I would just need a minute . A minute to talk to them . Helmut goes to the door and looks out .
KELTNER: I 'm going to ask you a question , Helmut , and I want you to think carefully before you answer . Helmut nods .
HELMUT: I know I ca n't perform for them anymore . I know that . I really do n't know what the reason is . I think it 's got something to do with well , I do n't want those little ones to think I 've turned against them , too . That 's why I 've got to do something . Something . Keltner studies Helmut for a moment .
KELTNER: You 'll be taking a chance . A great chance . Helmut nods that he know this .
HELMUT: Where are you going ?
KELTNER: You want to talk to the children ? Well , I think I can help you .
HELMUT: There 's no reason for you to get involved in this .
KELTNER: Reason ? When war is waged against children ! That is reason enough fo the whole damn world to get involved . And it will , believe me , it will .
LUDWIG: Kessler is going to talk to the children . Cover him .
GALT: Who says so ?
LUDWIG: The Reverend says cover him so we cover him .
GALT: All right ! I was just asking .
KELTNER: You know what to do ? Helmut nods .
HELMUT: Right .
KELTNER: Make it quick . You wo n't have much time .
HELMUT: Kick it , Ludwig . Kick it !
CHILDREN: Doork , Doork , Doork is back . It 's Doork . It 's Doork .
HELMUT: Shhh . Shhhh . The guards
CHILDREN: Do a trick , Doork . Please , Doork , please , please .
HELMUT: No , no . I ca n't . The guards wo n't let me . Not now . Maybe some othe day .
LITTLE GIRL: They 're bad .
HELMUT: What is it ? What happened ?
LITTLE GIRL: He hurt himself .
HELMUT: Shhh . Shhh . Do n't cry . It 's going to be all right . Be careful when you 're near this fence .
LITTLE GIRL: They 're new . We ca n't understand them . All they do is cry .
OLDER BOY: They 're all the way from Czechoslovakia .
HELMUT: There 's nothing to be afraid of . Everything is all right .
ADOLF: Hurry up .
HELMUT: Here . Look . I 'll show you No noise now .
GUARD: You would n't listen , would you ?
HELMUT: They had nothing to do with it . It was all my doing .
KELTNER: The children ! Not in front of the children !
BESTLER: Yes . Yes . Yes , I understand perfectly . However , I do n't see how we can be held responsible . Our orders were very clear . We were to have the freight car ready to be picked up at midnight . Of course , I 'm aware the operation must be kept secret . I just do n't have the staff to send down there now and Yes , I 'll wait .
SCHARFF: It 's still down there on the siding !
BESTLER: Some stupid mix up . If they think
SCHARFF: Sergeant Hoffman . Very reliable .
BESTLER: Apparently not reliable enough . The cargo seems to be raising quite a fuss .
SCHARFF: Fifty children , sir ! In a boxcar !
BESTLER: I know . I know . But the siding is n't far from town . The General does n't want unauthorized persons getting curious . Understand ?
SCHARFF: I 'll get some men down there right away .
BESTLER: Men ! You 'll get yourself down there . And take at least a dozen guards with you . Do n't let anyone get close to that boxcar under any circumstances . No one !
SCHARFF: Yes , sir .
BESTLER: Use any method you can , but shut them up . That 's an order .
SCHARFF: Sir , the clown ! Bestler looks at him quizzically .
BESTLER: Out of the question . The man 's being disciplined for that very thing . We ca n't change our position now .
SCHARFF: No one need know .
BESTLER: He 'd know .
SCHARFF: Sir , if I could guarantee he 'd neve say anything . Bestler looks interested .
BESTLER: A man who wants something . Good . Very good strategy , Lieutenant . However , when you bring him back here , return him to solitary and keep him there . I 've seen the best of men , afte several years in solitary , unable to emember even their own names .
SCHARFF: Then I have your permission to take the clown .
BESTLER: Permission granted .
HELMUT: Wish you could 've gotten the big shoes . The children laugh so when they see them flopping up and down .
SCHARFF: Finish your makeup . We 're almost there .
HELMUT: Know what Johann Keltner said ?
SCHARFF: Who ?
HELMUT: Keltner . From my barracks . The minister . He said Let me think . He said men who wage war on children . That 's it . Men who wage war on children commit such a crime such a heinous crime . That 's it . Men who wage war on children commit such a heinous crime that even the devil damns their souls .
SCHARFF: Wait here .
HOFFMAN: No , sir . The last we heard it wo n't get here until evening .
SCHARFF: Anyone been around ?
HOFFMAN: No , sir .
SCHARFF: With all that wailing , it 's a wonder . Could n't you keep them quiet ?
HOFFMAN: I did n't know what to do , Lieutenant . I was afraid to close both doors .
SCHARFF: Keep a tight guard on the whole area . No one gets near here . Understand ? You post them .
HOFFMAN: Yes , sir .
SCHARFF: Leave that here .
HELMUT: They 're crying .
SCHARFF: Take that in to them . Helmut picks up the sack and peers into it .
HELMUT: What is it ?
SCHARFF: Bread . They wo n't wait so loud with their mouths full .
HELMUT: How how long have they been here ?
SCHARFF: You just get in there and keep them quiet . You can do that , ca n't you ?
HELMUT: Yes , sir .
OLDER GIRL: Doork ? It 's Doork . It is ! It is !
HELMUT: So this is where you 've been hiding ?
BOY: I want to go home . Take me home .
HELMUT: Now , now , there 's nothing to cry about . We 're going to have fun . Here . I brought you something . The children pounce on the sack and tug at it , unsure what it is except that it 's a gift from Helmut .
LITTLE GIRL: I want to see my Mommy .
HELMUT: You would ? All right .
LITTLE GIRL: You know where she is ?
HELMUT: She 's right here with you .
LITTLE GIRL: I do n't see her .
HELMUT: That 's because you do n't know how to look . I 'll show you . Close you eyes . All of you close your eyes .
LITTLE GIRL: Does Mommy see me , Doork ?
HELMUT: Yes , she does . She has you safe in her heart , too .
BOY: Willie .
HELMUT: Willie . That 's a good name . How do you spell it ?
BOY: W-I-L-L-I-E .
HELMUT: Fine . I 'll just write that on top of your head .
BOY: Did you really ?
HELMUT: Of course I did . Here
OLDER BOY: It says Willie .
BOY: Really ? Truly ? He puts his hand to his head .
HELMUT: Be careful . Do n't smear it . Let 's see now Yes . You shall be next .
CZECH GIRL: Inga .
HELMUT: It 's such a pretty name say it again .
CZECH GIRL: Inga !
HELMUT: I-N-G-A . There it is .
LITTLE GIRL: So the little children will know he name .
HELMUT: Of course . That way she ca n't get lost , can she ? What 's her name ?
LITTLE GIRL: Frederika .
HELMUT: Frederika ?
LITTLE GIRL: Oh , no ! Frederika .
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: Clown . Clown , can you play one of these ?
HELMUT: It will . It will .
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: You wo n't say anything to the Lieutenant .
HELMUT: I promise .
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: Want to get me in trouble ?
HELMUT: I know . I know you would .
OLDER GIRL: Doork .
HELMUT: Do n't know .
OLDER GIRL: Do you have children ?
HELMUT: I do now .
SCHARFF: It finally got here .
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: Yes , sir .
SCHARFF: Help them get the car coupled on .
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: All right , clown , time to get off . Helmut appears at the door and looks down .
HELMUT: What is it ?
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: Train is here . They are hooking it up now . Here . Tell them not to light it up until the doors are closed . Helmut gives him a look of deep gratitude .
CHILDREN: We 're moving . What 's happening ? What was the noise ? Doork , where are we going ?
HELMUT: It 's nothing . You 're going for a train ride . What do you think of that ? A real train ride .
CHILDREN: Is it far ? Are you coming , too ? I do n't want a train ride .
HELMUT: Oh , it 'll be fun . I would like to come , but I do n't think I can .
CHILDREN: Please come , Doork . Please . Please . Please .
HELMUT: I ca n't . They want me to stay here .
GIRL: It 's his birthday . He thought there would be presents .
HELMUT: He 's a Czech . Do you speak
GIRL: Of course not !
HELMUT: Then how do you know it 's his irthday ?
GIRL: He told me .
HELMUT: He speaks German ?
GIRL: No .
HELMUT: But he told you it 's his birthday ?
GIRL: Why , it 's his birthday !
HELMUT: Of course , I do . Tell him I wish him a happy birthday .
GIRL: He knows that . But but what 're you going to do about a present ?
HELMUT: Aha , the very thing . He can be the clown while I 'm gone .
GERMAN BOY: He 's a boy ! Dolls are for girls .
HELMUT: When you give something you love it does n't matter if it 's the right thing .
CHILD: Let 's play some more , Doork ?
SCHARFF: I 'm glad that 's over . Call in the sentries .
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: Yes , sir . He starts to move away .
SCHARFF: Kessler in the car ?
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: Kessler ?
SCHARFF: The clown ?
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: I I guess he is , sir .
SCHARFF: You GUESS !
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: I told him , sir . HE was standing ight by the door . I 'm sure he got off .
SCHARFF: Did you see him ?
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: Why , I
SCHARFF: DID you ?
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: You told me to see that the car was coupled on . When I came back Why would n't he get off ?
SCHARFF: Idiot ! Guards . GUARDS ! The other soldiers come running from o.s .
SERGEANT HOFFMAN: He ca n't get very far .
SCHARFF: If he 's on that train he 's going farther than you know -
CHILDREN: What is it ? Are we there , Doork ? Where are we ? Why are we stopping ?
HELMUT: I do n't know .
BURLY GUARD: Everybody up . No noise .
HELMUT: Where are we ?
BURLY GUARD: How the devil did you get in here ?
HELMUT: I I 'm from the other prison . Got locked in by accident .
BURLY GUARD: Ah , for Sergeant !

BURLY GUARD: Look at this . He 's from the othe camp . Got in here with the shipment .

HELMUT: Do as he says . And , do n't worry , I 'll be with you soon . I promise .
SERGEANT: Come along , now .
HELMUT: This is just another prison .
SERGEANT: What 'd you expect ?
HELMUT: I thought the children were going to a better place .
RUNKEL: Close the door , and wait out there .
HELMUT: I explained . I got locked in the oxcar and
RUNKEL: Ah , yes . An accident . Unavoidable I suppose .
HELMUT: I was taking care I mean , the Commandant requested me to take care of the children .
RUNKEL: The Commandant !
HELMUT: Escaped ! But
RUNKEL: it was an accident . Are you one of them , clown ?
HELMUT: No no ! I 'm not one of them . I 'm not ! Runkel smiles , moves away from Helmut .
RUNKEL: You misunderstand completely . The Judas goat is never killed . He is n't worth killing . I 'm just asking you to lead them .
HELMUT: Sir Sir could I could I have a little time with them before before

HELMUT: There . There . It 's all right . It 's all right . Everything is going to e all right .
WILLIE: Doork ! Doork you 're great !
SERGEANT: It 's time .
HELMUT: Just a few more minutes ? The sergeant shakes his head .
CHILDREN: What 's the matter , Doork ? Where are we going ? You come with us this time . Where 're they taking us .
HELMUT: They they want us to move to another building where we 'll have more room to play . Tell you what . Let 's make it a big circus parade . Everybody get in a line behind
FIRST GUARD: Their clothes ! They 've got to undress .
SERGEANT: Leave them alone .
BRITISH ANNOUNCER: Reports are coming in from all ove the Empire from all over the world . The Government have not yet issued a statement , but there seems to be no question that there actually is a large , unidentified object circling the earth at incredible speed .
AMERICAN ANNOUNCER: We still do n't know what it is o where it 's from –- but we do know there 's something there . It 's been tracked around the world by rada traveling at a rate of four thousand miles an hour .
MAN: They 're here ! They 're here ! He runs off toward another group as we
BRIGADIER GENERAL: Get me the Chief of Staff .
GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIAL: I want to speak to the President . I 'm sorry you 'll have to interrupt him .
PEARSON: Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen , this is Drew Pearson . We bring you this special radio-television oadcast to give you the latest information on the landing of the `` space ship '' in Washington .
PEARSON: The ship , designed for travel outside the earth 's atmosphere , landed in Washington today at 3 47 p.m. , Eastern Standard Time . We still do n't know where it came from , but I can reveal that military leaders are considering two possibilities ; that it came from some unfriendly power here on earth or that it actually arrived from another planet .
PEARSON'S VOICE: The ship is resting exactly where it landed two hours ago , and there has een no sign of life from inside it .
PEARSON'S VOICE: They are supported by machine guns , tanks and artillery .
PEARSON: Just a minute , ladies and gentlemen ! I think I see something moving !
KLAATU: We have come to visit you in peace and with good will .
KLAATU: Gort ! Deglet ovrosco !
COLONEL: Is he all right ?
CAPTAIN: Yes , sir .
GENERAL: How is he ?
MAJOR WHITE: He 's all right , General Blood pressure 's a little high , but it could be aggravation .
GENERAL: Ca n't blame him . I always get mad when somebody shoots me .
MAJOR WHITE: He still wants to see the President .
COLONEL: We informed the White House over an hour ago .
GENERAL: Did n't drop any hints about where he 's from , did he ?
MAJOR WHITE: No , sir , he did n't .
CAPTAIN: Excuse me . What about the reporters , Colonel ? They 're swarming all over the lobby .
GENERAL: Tell them there wo n't be any statement tonight .
CAPTAIN: Yes , sir . Mr. Harley 's here from the White House .
HARLEY: General
GENERAL: Right in there , Mr. Harley .
HARLEY: My name is Harley Secretary to the President I 've been told that you speak ou language that your name is Mr. Klaatu .
KLAATU: Just Klaatu .
HARLEY: The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened . We all feel
KLAATU: Sit down , Mr. Harley .
HARLEY: I 'm sure I do n't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise . Had you been traveling long ?
KLAATU: About five months your months .
HARLEY: You must have come a long way .
KLAATU: About 250 million of your miles .
HARLEY: Naturally we 're very curious to know where it is you come from .
KLAATU: From another planet . Let 's just say that we 're neighbors .
HARLEY: It 's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor .
KLAATU: I 'm afraid , in the present situation you 'll have to learn to think that way .
HARLEY: The present situation ?
KLAATU: I mean the reasons for my coming here .
HARLEY: We 're very curious about that , too . Would you care to talk about it ?
KLAATU: I 'd be glad to . Not now , of course with you alone .
HARLEY: Perhaps you 'd rather discuss it personally with the President
KLAATU: This is not a personal matter , Mr. Harley . It concerns all the people on your planet .
HARLEY: I I 'm not sure I understand
KLAATU: I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth .
HARLEY: I 'm afraid that would be a little awkward . It 's it 's completely without precedent . And there are practical considerations the time involved the enormous distances .
KLAATU: I traveled 250 million miles . What about your United Nations ?
HARLEY: You know about the United Nations ?
KLAATU: We 've been monitoring your radio oadcasts for a good many years . That 's how we learned your languages . Lately , we 've been getting you television also .
HARLEY: You must have a rather strange impression of us .
KLAATU: The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle .
HARLEY: I 'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world . Surely you would agree
KLAATU: I am not concerned , Mr. Harley , with the internal affairs of your planet . I consider that to be your business not mine .
HARLEY: I was only hoping to make you understand .
KLAATU: My mission here is not to solve you petty squabbles . It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth .
HARLEY: Perhaps if you could explain a little
KLAATU: I intend to explain . To all the nations simultaneously . How do we proceed , Mr. Harley ?
HARLEY: We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly But of course the UN does n't represent all of the nations .
KLAATU: Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State ?
HARLEY: Believe me , you do n't understand . They would n't sit down at the same table .
KLAATU: I do n't want to resort to threats , Mr. Harley . I simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake I suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth .
HARLEY: I will make that recommendation to the President . I must tell you in all honesty that I 'm extremely dubious about the esults .
KLAATU: Apparently I 'm not as cynical about Earth 's people as you are .
HARLEY: I 've been dealing in Earth 's politics a good deal longer than you have . Goodnight , sir . He turns and goes out .
GENERAL: Getting any place , Sergeant ?
SERGEANT: No , sir . Beats me , General . I saw that ramp come out of the side of the ship ight here . Now I ca n't even find a crack !
GENERAL: What 's the report , Carlson ?
CARLSON: We 've tried everything from a lowtorch to a diamond drill .
GENERAL: What about him ?
CARLSON: He 's made out of the same stuff .
GENERAL: Has he moved ?
SERGEANT: No sir . Not an inch
CARLSON: This is the toughest material I eve saw , General . For hardness and strength , it 's out of this world .
GENERAL: I can tell you officially -– that 's where it came from .
MAJOR: The skeletal structure is completely normal . Same for the major organs -– heart , liver , spleen , kidneys .
CAPTAIN: And the lungs are the same as ours . Must mean a similar atmosphere similar pressure . How old do you think he is ?
MAJOR: Oh , I 'd say forty-five .
CAPTAIN: He told me this morning when I examined him . He 's seventy-eight .
MAJOR: I do n't believe it .
CAPTAIN: Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty .
MAJOR: How does he explain that ?
CAPTAIN: He says their medicine is that much more advanced . He was very nice about it . But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor .
MAJOR WHITE: I took a bullet out of that man 's arm yesterday .
FIRST MAJOR: What about it ?
MAJOR WHITE: I just examined the wound and it 's all healed .
FIRST MAJOR: What does he say about it ?
MAJOR WHITE: Said he put some salve on it some stuff he had with him .
CAPTAIN: What are you going to do with it ?
MAJOR WHITE: Take it downstairs and have it analyzed . Then I do n't know whether I 'll just get drunk or give up the practice of medicine .
FIRST MAJOR: Afternoon , Mr. Harley .
HARLEY: Afternoon , gentlemen .
KLAATU: Thank you Have you any news ?
HARLEY: Not very good news , I 'm afraid . The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night . Let me read you some of the replies . `` The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow . '' `` The suggestion of the President egarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty 's Government at the present time . Representation could e sent only if the meeting were held in Washington . '' Well there you have it .
KLAATU: It 's not your government I 'm thinking about . It 's your world .
HARLEY: Now that you understand the situation more clearly , perhaps you 'd like to discuss the matter with the President
KLAATU: I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations . I do n't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions .
HARLEY: Our problems are very complex , Mr. Klaatu . You must n't judge us too harshly .
KLAATU: I can judge only by what I see .
HARLEY: Your impatience is quite understandable .
KLAATU: I am impatient with stupidity . My people have learned to live without it .
HARLEY: I 'm afraid my people have n't . I 'm very sorry I wish it were otherwise .
KLAATU: Before making any decisions , I think I should get out among your people ecome familiar with the basis fo these strange , unreasoning attitudes .
HARLEY: Under the circumstances I 'm afraid that will be impossible .
RADIO VOICES: authorities at Walter Reed Hospital efused to comment on how he managed to escape , or what measures might be taken to apprehend him .
TELEVISION COMMENTATOR: while the President made no effort to minimize the crisis , he urged people all over the country to remain calm . He said the entire facilities of FBI and other federal agencies are being bought to bear . He pointed out , however , that this is no ordinary man hunt . He warned we may be up against powers that are beyond ou control .
MRS. CROCKETT: I ca n't stand any more of this . It 's enough to drive a person crazy . She snaps off the set sharply .
BOBBY: Hey , Mom who 's that ?
MRS. CROCKETT: I I 'm sorry . What is it you want ?
KLAATU: My name is Carpenter . I 'm looking for a room .
BOBBY: Are you an FBI man ?
KLAATU: No I 'm afraid not .
BOBBY: Bet he is , Mom . Bet he 's out looking for that space man .
HELEN: I think we 've all been hearing too much about `` space men . ''
MRS. CROCKETT: This is Mrs. Benson , Mr. Carpenter . And little Bobby . Mr. and Mrs . Barley and Mr. Krull I 'm Mrs. Crockett .
BOBBY: Can I help you look for the space man ? Can I ? I know what he looks like ! He 's got a square head and , three great ig eyes !
HELEN: That 's enough , Bobby . I think it 's time you went to bed .
MRS. CROCKETT: We must n't annoy Mr. Carpenter o he wo n't want to stay here . She goes on into the hall , followed by Klaatu , who has exchanged a polite smile with Helen .
KLAATU: How did you know ?
MRS. CROCKETT: Oh , I can tell a New England accent a mile away .
MRS. BARLEY: George , I wish you 'd turn that radio off . I 'm trying to concentrate .
MR. BARLEY: Why does n't the Government do something that 's what I want to know .
MR. KRULL: What can they do ? They 're only people Just like us .
MR. BARLEY: People my foot ! They 're Democrats !
MR. KRULL: It 's enough to give you the shakes . He 's got that robot standing there ten-foot tall just waiting fo orders to destroy us .
HELEN: This space man or whatever he is . We automatically assume he 's a menace Maybe he is n't at all .
MR. BARLEY: Then what 's he hiding for ? Why does n't he come out in the open ?
MR. KRULL: Yeah . Like the fella says `` What 's he up to ? ''
HELEN: Maybe he 's afraid .
MRS. BARLEY: He 's afraid !
HELEN: After all , he was shot the moment he landed here . I was just wondering what I would do .
KLAATU: Perhaps before deciding on a course of action , you 'd want to know more about the people here to orient yourself in a strange environment .
MRS. BARLEY: There 's nothing strange about Washington , Mr. Carpenter .
KLAATU: A person from another planet might disagree with you .
MRS. BARLEY: If you want my opinion , he came from ight here on Earth . And you know where I mean .
MR. KRULL: They would n't come in a space ship . They 'd come in airplanes .
MRS. BARLEY: I would n't be so sure about that .
MR. BARLEY: Stands to reason that fella wants some thing or he would n't be here . That make sense , Carpenter ?
KLAATU: I must admit I 'm a little confused . Mrs. Crockett enters and speaks to Helen .
MRS. CROCKETT: Mrs. Benson Mr. Stevens is here to see you .
HELEN: Oh thank you . She rises and goes out .
MRS. BARLEY: Finish your coffee , George . I told the Carsons we 'd be there at eleven .
HELEN: Good morning . Tom kisses her .
TOM: We 're all set . I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car . And the radio 's still busted , so me can forget about the space man fo today .
HELEN: There 's only one thing I have n't een able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby . I do n't suppose we could take him with us ?
TOM: Well , we could
HELEN: There 's always somebody here , but today of course they 've all got plans .
KLAATU'S VOICE: I have n't any plans . Helen and Tom turn in surprise .
KLAATU: I 'd be glad to spend the day with him if you 'd let me .
TOM: Say , that 'll be great ! Would n't it , Helen .
HELEN: It 's awfully nice of you to suggest it . I 'm sorry Mr. Carpenter this is Tom Stevens .
KLAATU: Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday afternoon . We talked and listened to the radio . I thought today he might show me around the city .
BOBBY: Gee I do n't know The space man , I guess .
KLAATU: I was speaking of earth men . I meant the greatest philosopher the greatest thinker .
B0BBY: You mean the smartest man in the whole world ?
KLAATU: Yes that would do nicely .
BOBBY: Well Professor Barnhardt , I guess . He 's the greatest scientist in the world .
KLAATU: He lives here in Washington , does n't he ?
BOBBY: Sure . Right near where my mothe works .
KLAATU: Where is that ?
BOBBY: Department of Commerce . She 's a secretary . They have a man they call the Secretary , but he is n't at all . My mother 's a real secretary . Mr. Carpenter now can we go see the space ship ?
KLAATU: I should n't be at all surprised . Bobby 's attention shifts to the ship .
BOBBY: Gee , I 'd like to get inside and see how it works . What do you think makes it go ?
KLAATU: Well atomic power , I would imagine .
BOBBY: I thought that was only for bombs .
KLAATU: No . It 's for a lot of other things , too .
BOBBY: You think it can go faster than an F-
KLAATU: Yes I think so .
BOBBY: About a thousand miles an hour ?
KLAATU: Maybe four thousand miles an hour . And outside the Earth 's atmosphere a good deal faster .
BOBBY: Gee ! How could they make a landing ?
KLAATU: Well there are several ways to educe landing speed . You see , the velocity
MAN: Keep goin ' , Mister . He was fallin ' for it .
BOBBY: You think they 'll ever find him ?
KLAATU: I do n't know , Bobby . I 'm inclined to doubt it .
BOBBY: Mr. Carpenter what does velocity mean ?
KLAATU: Velocity is the time rate of change of position .
BOBBY: I 'll bet that 's the way Professo Barnhardt talks .
KLAATU: Bobby I have an idea . Let 's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks .
BOBBY: You 're just kidding , are n't you ?
KLAATU: Would n't you like to meet him ?
BOBBY: Well , sure I would , but Aw , I 'll bet you 'd be scared .
KLAATU: We can scare him more than he can scare us .
BOBBY: I like you , Mr. Carpenter . You 're a eal screwball .
KLAATU: It 's a problem in celestial mechanics .
BOBBY: Bet he 's the only one in the world knows the answer .
KLAATU: He does n't know the answer . And he 'll never get it that way .
BOBBY: We probably could n't get to see him even if he was home .
KLAATU: If he 's that difficult to see , perhaps we ought to leave a calling card .
HILDA'S VOICE: What are you doing in here ?
HILDA: How dare you write on that blackboard ! Do you realize the Professor has een working on that problem fo weeks ?
KLAATU: He 'll catch on to it in no time now .
HILDA: How did you get in here ? And what do you want ?
KLAATU: We came to see Professor Barnhardt .
HILDA: Well , he 's not here . And he wo n't be ack till this evening . I think you 'd better leave now . Unruffled , Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad . He tears off the piece of pape and hands it to Hilda .
KLAATU: You might keep this . I think the professor will want to get in touch with me .
HILDA: no , Sergeant , there was no classified material around , but I have instructions to report anything unusual to the police Yes I 'm Professor Barnhardt 's secretary . The man 's name is Carpenter and he lives at 1615 St. Street , N.W Yes , that 's right
BOBBY: That 's my father . He was killed at a place called Anzio .
KLAATU: Did all these people die in wars ?
BOBBY: Sure . Did n't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery ?
KLAATU: No I 'm afraid not .
BOBBY: Mr. Carpenter '' you do n't seem to know about anything .
KLAATU: I 'll tell you , Bobby I 've been away for a long time . Very far away .
BOBBY: Is it different where you 've been ? Do n't they have places like this ?
KLAATU: They have cemeteries . But not like this one You see , they do n't have any wars .
BOBBY: Gee that 's a good idea .
KLAATU: What would you like to do this afternoon ?
BOBBY: Go to the movies .
KLAATU: All right .
BOBBY: No foolin ' ? Will you ?
KLAATU: Certainly . Tell me , Bobby do you have to have money to go there ?
BOBBY: I 've got some money . My mother gave me two dollars .
KLAATU: No I want to take you to the movies . Do you think they 'd accept these ?
BOBBY: Gee those look like diamonds !
KLAATU: Some places that 's what people use for money . They 're easy to carry and they do n't wear out .
BOBBY: Bet they 're worth about a million dollars .
KLAATU: Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them ?
BOBBY: Well , sure , but
KLAATU: Why not , Bobby ?
BOBBY: She does n't like me to steal from people .
DETECTIVE: Mr. Carpenter come home yet ?
BOBBY: Yeah he 's right inside .
DETECTIVE: Tell him I 'd like to see him .
BOBBY: Mr. Carpenter ! Come on in .
DETECTIVE: Your name Carpenter ?
KLAATU: Yes . Oh I suppose Professor Barnhardt 's looking far me .
DETECTIVE: I been looking for you all afternoon .
HELEN: It was a wonderful day .
TOM: You still have n't answered my question .
HELEN: You know how I feel , Tom . I just want to think it over .
TOM: The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow . If I could tell him I was getting married with two dependents
HELEN: You 're a good salesman but I 've got to think about it .
TOM: A good insurance salesman would n't give you time to think .
HELEN: 'Night .
BOBBY: Hi Mom !
HELEN: Hello , darling . Good evening , Mr. Carpenter .
KLAATU: Mrs. Benson this is Mr. Brady .

FOURTH COP: Cappo , John C ? Two priors one for petty theft one for shoplifting .
FIFTH COP: Okay , Jonny you can go .
MAN: Sometimes a record comes in handy .
LIEUTENANT: The Professor 's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt 's room , making marks on his blackboard .
KLAATU: I was only trying to be helpful . He was having difficulty with a problem .
LIEUTENANT: Oh , I see . He was having trouble and you were helping him out .
KLAATU: That 's right .
LIEUTENANT: I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army .
KLAATU: In this case the secret would n't be worth much . He does n't know the answe himself .
LIEUTENANT: But I suppose you know the answer .
KLAATU: It 's really quite simple The three- ody problem , you know .
LIEUTENANT: Your name 's Carpenter that right ? Any identification , Mr. Carpenter ? Driver 's license social security number ?
KLAATU: No I 'm afraid not .
LIEUTENANT: Well , how do I know who you are ?
KLAATU: You do n't .
COP: Excuse me , Lieutenant The Doc says this man needs treatment ight away .
LIEUTENANT: What 's the story ?
COP: Some fella caught him lookin ' in a window and figured he was the space man . The whole neighborhood went crazy and they ganged up on him . Would have killed him if we had n't come along Turns out he was just a prowler .
LIEUTENANT: Okay book him and get him fixed up . Looks like everybody 's goin ' nuts .
KLAATU: They would have killed this man ?
LIEUTENANT: People get hysterical enough , they do anything . Look , Mr. Carpenter if you ca n't identify yourself , I got to send you over to the Army .
KLAATU: How long will that take ?
LIEUTENANT: They can tell right away . They 've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital . Take him over to G2 .
KLAATU: It 's very important , Lieutenant , that I see Professor Barnhardt .
DETECTIVE: Come on , Mr. Carpenter
KLAATU: May I suggest that you call the Professor ?
LIEUTENANT: Get going , will you , Brady before I get mad !
LIEUTENANT: Wait a minute , Brady The Captain here 's got orders from General Cutler to take this man ove to Professor Barnhardt .
M.P. CAPTAIN: Will you come with me , Sir ?
KLAATU: Sorry to trouble you , Lieutenant .
M.P. CAPTAIN: This is the man you wanted to see , Professor .
BARNHARDT: Thank you , Captain .
M.P. CAPTAIN: I 'll wait outside .
BARNHARDT: You wrote this ?
KLAATU: It was a clumsy way to introduce myself but I understand you 're a difficult man to see . I thought you 'd have the solution by this time .
BARNHARDT: Not yet . That 's why I wanted to see you .
KLAATU: All you have to do now is substitute this expression at this point .
BARNHARDT: Yes that will reproduce the first- order terms . But what about the effect of the other terms ?
KLAATU: Almost negligible With variation of parameters , this is the answer .
BARNHARDT: How can you be so sure ? Have you tested this theory ?
KLAATU: I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another . I understand you 've called a meeting to study our space ship .
BARNHARDT: As though unsure of what he 's heard ) Yes yes , I have .
KLAATU: My name is Klaatu . I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital . Room 309 . My doctor 's name was Major White and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth , who 's getting married next Wednesday . If you are not interested or if you intend to turn me over to you Army we need n't waste any more time .
BARNHARDT: You can go now , Captain . Please thank General Cutler and tell him tell him that I know this gentleman .
KLAATU: You have faith , Professor Barnhardt
BARNHARDT: It is n't faith that makes good science , Mr. Klaatu . Its curiosity . Sit down , please . I have several thousand questions to ask you .
KLAATU: I would like to explain something of my mission here .
BARNHARDT: That was my first question .
KLAATU: It was my intention to discuss this officially with all the nations of the Earth but I was not allowed the Opportunity . I have come to ealize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal eactions of a primitive society . We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy . We also know that you are experimenting with ockets .
BARNHARDT: Yes that is true .
KLAATU: In the hands of a mature civilization , these would not be considered weapons of aggression . But in the hands of your people We 've observed your aggressive tendencies , and we do n't trust you with such power .
BARNHARDT: If you mean that you are afraid of us
KLAATU: We want to be sure you do n't make let us say an unfortunate mistake . We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children You see , we 've had atomic energy fo five thousand of your years . We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago . So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves with your primitive tanks and planes we were unconcerned . But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships and then you become a threat to the peace and security of othe planets . That , of course , we can not tolerate .
BARNHARDT: These other planets do they have peace and security ?
KLAATU: We had our atomic wars thousands of years ago . After that we fought with bows and arrows . Then , slowly , we learned that fighting is no solution that aggression leads to chaos .
BARNHARDT: We scientists understand this . Even we primitive scientists . What exactly is the nature of you mission , Mr. Klaatu ?
KLAATU: I came here to warn you that , by threatening danger , your planet faces danger very grave danger . I am prepared , however , to offer a solution .
BARNHARDT: Would you care to be more specific ?
KLAATU: What I have to say must be said to all concerned . It is too important to be entrusted to any individual .
BARNHARDT: I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful .
KLAATU: I come to you as a last resort and I confess that my patience is wearing thin . Must I take drastic action in orde to get a hearing ?
BARNHARDT: What what sort of action do you mean ?
KLAATU: Violent action since that seems to be the only thing you people understand . Leveling the island of Manhattan , perhaps or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea .
BARNHARDT: Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together ? . Perhaps you could explain your mission to them , and they in turn could present it to their various peoples .
KLAATU: That 's what I came to see you about .
BARNHARDT: It is not enough to have men of science . We scientists are too easily ignored or misunderstood . We must get important men from every field . Educators philosophers church leaders men of vision and imagination the finest minds in the world .
KLAATU: I leave that in your hands .
BARNHARDT: You 'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting ?
KLAATU: No not at all .
BARNHARDT: What about your personal safety in the meantime ? What about the Army and the police ?
KLAATU: My name is Carpenter and I 'm a very earthy character living in a espectable boarding house .
BARNHARDT: I 'm afraid I ca n't offer you any eal protection . I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy .
KLAATU: I 'm sure I 'll be quite safe until the meeting .
BARNHARDT: One thing , Mr. Klaatu . Suppose this group should reject your proposals . What is the alternative ?
KLAATU: I 'm afraid you have no alternative . In such , a case the planet Earth would have to be eliminated .
BARNHARDT: Such power exists ?
KLAATU: I assure you such power exists .
BARNHARDT: The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this . They must understand what is at stake . You mentioned a demonstration of force
KLAATU: Yes .
BARNHARDT: Would such , a demonstration be possible before the meeting ?
KLAATU: Yes of course .
BARNHARDT: Something that would dramatize fo them and for their people the seriousness of the situation . Something that would affect the entire planet .
KLAATU: That can easily be arranged .
BARNHARDT: I would n't want you to harm anybody or destroy anything .
KLAATU: Why do n't you leave it to me ? I 'll think of something .
BARNHARDT: Maybe a little demonstration .
KLAATU: Something dramatic but not destructive . It 's quite an interesting problem . Would day after tomorrow be all right ? Say about noon ?
MRS. CROCKETT: Going out , dear ?
HELEN: Yes , I 'm waiting for Tom to pick me up .
MRS. CROCKETT: Personally , I wo n't go out afte dark these days . But then I 'm not courting , am I ?
KLAATU: Everyone seems so
HELEN: Jittery is the word .
KLAATU: Bobby 's the only person I know who is n't Jittery .
HELEN: He has his homework to keep him occupied .
KLAATU: He 's a fine boy , Mrs. Benson .
HELEN: Naturally I think so .
KLAATU: Warm and friendly and intelligent You know he 's the only real friend I 've made since I 've been here .
HELEN: Mr. Carpenter this is none of my usiness , but why did that detective come here last night ?
KLAATU: Oh they just wanted to ask me a few questions . Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon , but he was n't in . Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind .
HELEN: Hello
TOM: You ready ?
HELEN: I will be in just a minute .
TOM: The picture starts at eight-fifty .
HELEN: I was talking to Mr. Carpenter .
TOM: I hope Mr. Carpenter wo n't think I 'm intruding .
KLAATU: Excuse me . I was just going up to my oom .
HELEN: Goodnight , Mr. Carpenter .
KLAATU: Have a good time both of you .
HELEN: Why do n't you wait in here while I get my things ?
TOM: I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter . I do n't like the way he 's attached himself to you and Bobby . After all , what do you know about him ?
HELEN: I 'll go get my things .
KLAATU: All you have to remember is , first find the common denominator then subtract .
BOBBY: Thanks , Mr. Carpenter .
KLAATU: I 'll say goodnight again .
HELEN: Mr. Carpenter , I Goodnight .
KLAATU: Goodnight , my dear .
HELEN: Go to bed , darling . You can finish that in the morning .
BOBBY: Okay .
HELEN: Bobby I think it would be bette if we did n't see quite so much of Mr. Carpente
BOBBY: Gee , why , Mom ? He 's my best friend And he 's awful good in arithmetic . He even helps Professor Barnhardt .
HELEN: Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt ?
BOBBY: Sure we did ! He was n't there but we went to see him . And Mr. Carpente showed him how to do his arithmetic .
HELEN: What do you mean , dear ?
BOBBY: I mean on account of that policeman last night . You think he 's a bank robber , maybe ? Or a gangster ?
HELEN: No , dear , of course not . He 's a very nice man . I Just think he might prefe to be left alone . Now you get to bed and forget about it . 'Night , darling .
BOBBY: Goodnight . Hey Mom why would he want to be alone ?
KLAATU: Bobby have you a flashlight ?
BOBBY: Yeah sure . It 's a real Boy Scout flashlight .
KLAATU: Why the light in my room went out . Thank you , Bobby . Goodnight .
HELEN'S VOICE: Why do n't you come on in for a minute ?
HELEN: Bobby ! What are you doing up at this hour ?
BOBBY: I could n't go to sleep , Mom . I had to tell you !
HELEN: Tell me what ?
BOBBY: I followed Mr. Carpenter right after you left and , gee , Mom , where do you think he went ? Right into the space ship !
HELEN: Now , Bobby , just a minute
BOBBY: Honest , Mom , I saw him . It just opened up and he walked right in . And that great big iron man was moving around !
HELEN: Bobby , you 've been dreaming again .
BOBBY: No , I have n't , Mom . I promise you I saw it !
TOM: Where did you see all this , Bobby ?
BOBBY: On the lawn down at the mall in that place with the soldiers out front .
TOM: Where were the soldiers all this time ?
BOBBY: That robot fella grabbed 'em and dragged 'em inside ! I like Mr. Carpenter but I 'm scared , Mom .
HELEN: Must n't be frightened , darling It was just a bad dream . Here we 'll prove it to you . Tom , will you ask Mr. Carpenter if he 'll come down for a minute . The room right opposite mine .
BOBBY: Yes , I have !
HELEN: You did n't really see the space ship . You just thought you did .
BOBBY: I 'd never call you a liar .
TOM: He 's not there . But look what I found in his room
HELEN: Is it real ?
TOM: Looks real to me .
BOBBY: Mr. Carpenter 's got a lot of diamonds . He gave me a couple of them .
HELEN: He gave these to you ?
BOBBY: Well , not exactly . I gave him two dollars .
TOM: This does n't make sense I think the guy 's a crook . I never did trust him .
BOBBY: Gee , Mom , do you think maybe he 's a diamond smuggler ?
HELEN: Come on , darling we 're going up to bed .
TOM: I wonder if we ought to
HELEN: Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight .
TOM: You think it 's all right for you to stay here ?
HELEN: I 've got a good lock on my door . And Bobby 's going to sleep in my oom tonight .
BOBBY: Oh , boy can I , Mom ?
HELEN: Yes , dear . Come on now . Bobby , your shoes are soaking !
BOBBY: Yeah the grass was kind of wet .
HELEN: Oh hello
KLAATU: May I see you for a minute ?
HELEN: I I was Just going to lunch .
KLAATU: May I walk out with you ?
HELEN: Mrs. Benson speaking . Oh , hello
TOM: I 'm at Bleeker 's getting an appraisal on that diamond . I thought we might have lunch together .
HELEN: I I 'm afraid I ca n't not right now . Can I talk to you later ? . Yes , that 'll be fine . 'Bye .
KLAATU: I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school
HELEN: Yes ?
KLAATU: I want to know what he told you last night .
HELEN: I I did n't really pay much attention Bobby has such an active imagination .
KLAATU: Did you believe what he told you ? I have a reason for asking this a very important reason .
HELEN: There 's another elevator we can use
HELEN: What is it you want ?
KLAATU: Before I ask you to be honest with me , perhaps I should be completely honest with you
HELEN: What happened ?
KLAATU: What time is it ?
HELEN: Just twelve .
KLAATU: We 'll be stuck here for a little while about thirty minutes .
HELEN: We could try pushing the othe uttons . I have a flashlight in my purse .
KLAATU: It wo n't work .
HELEN: Why not ?
KLAATU: You see the electricity 's been neutralized all over the world .
HELEN: Bobby was telling the truth was n't he ? Klaatu stares at her evenly , as we
CAB DRIVER: My ol ' lady was right . We shoulda got a place in the country .
COCKNEY: It 's that space man that 's wot it is .
HILDA: You should see it , Professo Barnhardt ! You should go out and see it for yourself !
BARNHARDT: Thanks I 'm enjoying it right here .
HILDA: The whole city has stopped . People are running around like ants !
BARNHARDT: What a brilliant idea . I never would have thought of it .
HILDA: I talked to most of them this morning They were all very curious about the meeting .
BARNHARDT: Good . Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter ?
HILDA: He 'll be there at 8 30 .
BARNHARDT: Tell me , Hilda does all this frighten you does it make you feel insecure ?
HILDA: Yes , sir it certainly does !
BARNHARDT: That 's good , Hilda . I 'm glad .
GENERAL: as far as we can tell , all power 's een cut off everywhere with a few exceptions hospitals , planes in flight that sort of thing . I wish I could be more specific but , as you now , all communications are out telephone , radio , cable everything . I can tell you that the President is prepared to declare a state of national emergency . Before we start discussing plans , I want a report from Colonel Ryder . What about the robot , Colonel ?
COLONEL RYDER: When it was discovered last night that the robot had moved , I was directed by the Joint Chiefs to find a means of immobilizing him . We accomplished that this morning by encasing him in a block of KL 93 . It 's a new plastic material stronger than steel .
GENERAL: Is it possible that he 's broken out of this stuff ?
COLONEL: No , sir . I 've Just checked on that . He 's locked up tight as a drum .
GENERAL: All right that means we concentrate on the man . Up till now we 've agreed on the desirability of capturing this man alive . We can no longer afford to be so particular . We 'll get him alive , if possible but we must get him ! Is that clear ?
JEWELER: Eleanor , did you call the electrician ?
GIRL: I tried , Mr. Bleeker . But the phone does n't work , either .
JEWELER: Well , call the phone company .
GIRL: But the phone does n't work .
TOM: Is it worth anything ?
JEWELER: I have never seen such a stone . Will you please tell me where it came from ?
TOM: That 's what I wanted you to tell me .
JEWELER: There are no diamonds like this any place in the world .
TOM: You sure about that ?
JEWELER: Would you like to sell it ?
TOM: No no , thanks .
JEWELER: I 'd give you a very good price .
KLAATU: I 've already told you more than I told Professor Barnhardt , because my life , in a sense , is in your hands . I thought if you knew the facts you 'd appreciate the importance of my not eing apprehended , before the meeting tonight .
HELEN: Yes , of course . Of course I do .
KLAATU: I can see no other hope for you planet . If the meeting should fail , then I 'm afraid there is no hope .
HELEN: Yes Just exactly .
KLAATU: Back to the boardinghouse . I 'll be safe there for the afternoon and I can keep an eye on Bobby . He 's the only other person who knows anything about
HELEN: No , wait a minute there 's someone else .
KLAATU: Who ?
HELEN: Tom He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw .
SECRETARY: I do n't know , Mrs. Benson . He left efore noon before that awful electric business . I 'm scared to death , Mrs. Benson . I No , he would n't tell me where he was gong . Said it was something personal .
HELEN: Tell him I want to see him the minute he gets in No , I 'll call back .
VOICE: Attention , please . All flights from National Airport have been canceled until further notice.. All flights from this airport have been canceled .
SECRETARY: Honest , Mary , I 'm so scared I ca n't sit still . I 'd like to run some place , ut I do n't know where to go 'Bye now .
TOM: Call the Pentagon and find out who 's in charge of this space man business . Whoever it is I want to talk to him .
SECRETARY: Mrs. Benson 's been trying to get you all afternoon . She says it 's important .
TOM: Get this other call first .
SECRETARY: Oh , Mrs. Benson He just walked in . Are you nervous , too ?
HELEN: Yes , I am , Margaret .
SECRETARY: Mrs. Benson is here . Go on in .
HELEN: Tom I 've been trying to get you all afternoon
TOM: Come on in .
HELEN: What about him ?
TOM: Helen , he 's the man from the space ship ! I had that diamond checked at three different places . Nobody on earth 's ever seen a stone like that ! Afte what Bobby told us , that 's enough for me . Why is it nobody knows anything about him ? Why has n't he got any money ?
HELEN: All right , Tom it 's true . I know it 's true .
TOM: How do you know ?
HELEN: Never mind about that . You 've got to promise me you wo n't say a word to anybody .
TOM: Are you crazy ? After what happened today ?
HELEN: You do n't understand . You do n't ealize how important it is .
TOM: Important ? Of course it 's important . The point is we can do something about it .
HELEN: That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . We must n't do anything about it . Believe me , Tom , I know what I 'm talking about .
TOM: He 's a menace to the whole world ! It 's our duty to turn him in .
HELEN: But he is n't a menace ! He told me what he came here for .
TOM: He told you Do n't be silly , honey just because you like the guy . You realize what this 'd mean for us ? I 'd be the biggest man in the country . I could write my own ticket .
HELEN: Is that what you 're thinking about ?
TOM: Why not ? Somebody 's got to get rid of him .
HELEN: I 'm not going to let you do it , Tom . Believe me , this is literally the most important thing in the world . Tom picks up the phone and answers it .
TOM: Yes ? What 's his name , Margaret ? General Cutler ? All right , I 'll hold on .
HELEN: Tom , you must n't ! You do n't know what you 're doing ! It is n't just you and Mr. Carpenter . The rest of the world , is involved !
TOM: I do n't care about the rest of the world !
HELEN: I feel different right now .
TOM: You wait and see . You 're going to marry a big hero !
HELEN: I 'm not going to marry anybody .
TOM: Hello , General Cutler ? No , I do n't want to speak to his aide . I want to speak to the General . Tell him it 's about the space man My name is Tom Stevens . S-t-e-v-e-n- s .
GENERAL CUTLER: Thank you very much , Mr. Stevens . I 'll want to talk to you further but I have n't time now . Deploy all Zone 5 units according to Plan B immediately .
COLONEL: Attention , Zone 5 Yellow cab , moving north on B from Ninth Street . Man and woman in back seat . Get the license number and report .
KLAATU: I 'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting .
HELEN: Where is the meeting going to be ?
KLAATU: At the ship .
COLONEL: Attention , Zone 5 license numbe of target vehicle is W 4936 All vehicles maintain your positions and hold your fire .
HELEN: It 's only a few blocks to Barnhardt 's .
KLAATU: I 'm worried about Gort . I 'm afraid of what he might do if anything should happen to me .
HELEN: Gort ? But he 's a robot . I mean without you , what could he do ?
KLAATU: There 's no limit to what he could do . He could destroy the Earth . If anything should happen to me , you must go to Gort . You must give him this message `` Klaatu barada nikto . '' Please repeat that .
HELEN: `` Klaatu barada nikto . ''
KLAATU: Remember those words . Helen nods , repeating the words soundlessly .
COLONEL: Attention , Zone 5 Section numbe 2 block off Tenth Street at Massachusetts . All vehicles close in .
DRIVER: Hey , what 's this all about ?
KLAATU: Get that message to Gort . Right away
HELEN: Gort ! Klaatu barada nikto .
COLONEL: Yes , sir , we 've got the body here now . Downstairs in a cell No question about it , General he 's dead all right Yes , sir . Yes I understand .
KLAATU: Hello .
HELEN: I I thought you were
KLAATU: I was .
HELEN: You mean he has the power of life and death ?
KLAATU: No that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit .
HELEN: But how how long ?
KLAATU: How long will I live ? That no one can say .
COLONEL: I 'm sorry , Professor Barnhardt I have to ask you to call off this meeting .
BARNHARDT: Call it off ? I But I had permission from the Army
COLONEL: I know you did . But the robots on the loose now and it is n't safe around here . You 'll have to get your friends out of that building .
KLAATU: Gort and I will be leaving soon .
HELEN: We 'll miss you very much Bobby and I . He wo n't have anyone to play with .
KLAATU: He 'll have you and Tom .
HELEN: No . That 's all finished .
KLAATU: I 'm sorry .
HELEN: I think I 'm very lucky . You do n't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it .
BARNHARDT: Ladies and Gentlemen
KLAATU: Gort berengo . Gort moves off obediently .
BARNHARDT: under the circumstances , the Army people have asked us to leave the uilding . And , since their concern is for our safety , I can do nothing ut suggest that we comply
KLAATU: I am leaving soon and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly . The Universe grows smaller every day and the threat of aggression by any group anywhere can no longe e tolerated .
KLAATU'S VOICE: There must be security for all o no one is secure This does not mean giving up any freedom except the freedom to act irresponsibly .
KLAATU: We of the other planets have long accepted this principle . We have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets and for the complete elimination of aggression . A sort of United Nations on the Planetary level The test of any such highe authority , of course , is the police force that supports it . For ou policemen , we created a race of robots Their function is to patrol the planets in space ships like this one and preserve the peace . In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us .
KLAATU'S VOICE: At the first sign of violence they act automatically against the aggressor . And the penalty fo provoking their action is too terrible to risk .
KLAATU: The result is that we live in peace , without arms or armies , secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war free to pursue more profitable enterprises . We do not pretend to have achieved perfection but we do have a system and it works . I came here to give you the facts . It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet but if you threaten to extend your violence , this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder .
KLAATU: Gort veracto .
GEORGE: Maybe time to clear out .
MOTHER: Now remember , keep your shoulders back .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay , put your arm around your brother . That 's it . And breathe in . The young boy blinks as the flash goes off .
PHOTOGRAPHR: Okay , one more .
TEACHER: Now just to review , you 're going to follow along the procession until you get to the headmaster . At that point he will indicate to you to light the candles of the boys .
MAN: All right boys , let 's settle down .

PITTS: `` Gather ye rosebuds while ye may , old time is still a flying , and this same flower that smiles today , tomorrow will e dying . ''
KEATING: Thank you Mr. Pitts . `` Gather ye rosebuds while ye may . '' The Latin term for that sentiment is Carpe Diem . Now who knows what that means ? Meeks immediately puts his hand up .
MEEKS: Carpe Diem . That 's `` seize the day . ''
KEATING: Very good , Mr.-
MEEKS: Meeks .
KEATING: Meeks . Another unusual name . Seize the day . Gather ye rosebuds while ye may . Why does the writer use these lines ?

PITTS: No sir . Science experiment , radar .
KEATING: Gentlemen , open your text to page twenty-one of the introduction . Mr. Perry , will you read the opening paragraph of the preface , entitled `` Understanding Poetry '' ?
NEIL: Understanding Poetry , by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard , Ph.D. To fully understand poetry , we must first be fluent with its meter , rhyme , and figures of speech . Then ask two questions One , how artfully has the objective of the poem been endered , and two , how important is that objective . Question one rates the poem 's perfection , question two rates its importance . And once these questions have een answered , determining a poem 's greatest becomes a relatively simple matter .
KEATING: Excrement . That 's what I think of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard . We 're not laying pipe , we 're talking about poetry .
CAMERON: We should n't be doing this .
NEIL: Rip , rip , rip ! Neil makes Cameron turn back around .
MCALLISTER: What the hell is going on here ?
KEATING: I do n't hear enough rips .
MCALLISTER: Mr. Keating .
KEATING: Mr. McAllister .
MCALLISTER: I 'm sorry , I- I did n't know you were here .
KEATING: I am .
MCALLISTER: Ahh , so you are . Excuse me .
KEATING: Keep ripping gentlemen . This is a battle , a war . And the casualties could be you hearts and souls .
ALL: For what we are about to receive , may the Lord make us truly grateful . Amen .
MCALLISTER: Quite an interesting class you gave today , Mr. Keating .
KEATING: I 'm sorry if I shocked you , Mr. McAllister .
MCALLISTER: Oh , there 's no need to apologize . It was very fascinating , misguided though it was .
KEATING: You think so ?
MCALLISTER: You take a big risk by encouraging them to e artists John . When they realize they 're not Rembrandts , Shakespeares or Mozarts , they 'll hate you for it .
KEATING: We 're not talking artists George , we 're talking free thinkers .
MCALLISTER: Free thinkers at seventeen ?
KEATING: Funny , I never pegged you as a cynic .
MCALLISTER: Not a cynic , a realist . Show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams , and I 'll show you a happy man .
KEATING: But only in their dreams can man be truly free . 'T was always thus , and always thus will be .
MCALLISTER: Tennyson ?
KEATING: No , Keating .
NEIL: Hey , I found his senior annual in the library .
CAMERON: Man most likely to do anything .
CHARLIE: Thigh man . Mr. K was a hell-raiser .
KNOX: What 's the Dead Poets Society ?
NEIL: I do n't know .
MEEKS: Is there a picture in the annual ?
NEIL: Nothing . No other mention of it .
KEATING: Gentlemen .
NEIL: We were just looking in your old annual .
KEATING: Oh my God . No , that 's not me . Stanley `` The Tool '' Wilson-
NEIL: What was the Dead Poets Society ?
KEATING: I doubt the present administration would look too favorably upon that .
NEIL: Why ? What was it ?
KEATING: Gentlemen , can you keep a secret ?
NEIL: Sure . The other boys crouch down around Keating .
KEATING: The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life . That 's a phrase from Thoreau that we 'd invoke at the eginning of each meeting . You see we 'd gather at the old Indian cave and take turns reading from Thoreau , Whitman , Shelley ; the biggies . Even some of ou own verse . And in the enchantment of the moment we 'd let poetry work its magic .
KNOX: You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry ?
KEATING: No Mr. Overstreet , it was n't just `` guys '' , we were n't a Greek organization , we were omantics . We did n't just read poetry , we let it drip from our tongues like honey . Spirits soared , women swooned , and gods were created , gentlemen , not a bad way to spend an evening eh ? Thank you Mr. Perry for this trip down amnesia lane . Burn that , especially my picture .
NEIL: Dead Poets Society .
CAMERON: What ?
NEIL: I say we go tonight .
CHARLIE: Tonight ?
CAMERON: Wait a minute .
PITTS: Where 's this cave he 's talking about ?
NEIL: It 's beyond the stream . I know where it is .
PITTS: That 's miles .
CAMERON: Sounds boring to me .
CHARLIE: Do n't go .
CAMERON: You know how many de-merits we 're talking Dalton
CHARLIE: So do n't come , please .
CAMERON: Look , all I 'm saying is that we have to e careful , we ca n't get caught .
CHARLIE: No shit , Sherlock .
HAGER: You boys there , hurry up . Neil turns around and faces the other boys .
NEIL: All right , who 's in ?
CAMERON: Come on Neil , Hager 's right-
NEIL: Forget Hager , no . Who 's in ?

MEEKS: His grades are hurting Charlie .
NEIL: You can help him Meeks .
PITTS: What is this , a midnight study group ?
NEIL: Forget it Pitts , you 're coming . Meeks , are your grades hurting too ?
MEEKS: I 'll try anything once .
CHARLIE: Except sex .
MEEKS: Ha ha ha .
CAMERON: I mean as long as we 're careful . The boys run into the building .
CHARLIE: What about you Knox ?
KNOX: I do n't know Charlie .
CHARLIE: Come on Knox , it 'll help you get Chris .
KNOX: Yeah ? How ?
CHARLIE: Women swoon .
KNOX: But why do they swoon ? Charlie , tell me why they swoon . Charlie !
NEIL: Okay , follow the stream to the waterfall . It 's right there . It 's got to be on the anks .
CAMERON: I do n't know , it 's starting to sound dangerous .
CHARLIE: Well , why do n't you stay home ?
MCALLISTER: For God 's sake stop chattering and sit down .
NEIL: Todd , are you coming tonight ?
TODD: No .
NEIL: Why not ? God , you were there . You heard Keating . Do n't you want to do something about it ?
TODD: Yes , but-
NEIL: But ? But what ?
TODD: Keating said that everybody took turns eading and I do n't want to do that .
NEIL: Gosh , you really have a problem with that , do n't you ?
TODD: N- no , I do n't have a problem . Neil , I just- I just do n't want to do it , okay ?
NEIL: All right . What if you did n't have to ead ? What if you just came and listened ?
TODD: That 's not how it works .
NEIL: Forget how it works . What if - what if they said it was okay ?
TODD: What ? What are you gon na do , go up and ask them ? Neil shrugs .
NEIL: I 'll be right back .
TODD: Neil , Neil !
MCALLISTER: Oh shut up , will you .
SPAZ: That 's my- that 's for my asthma , okay . Could you give that back please ? Could you give that back ?
BOY: What 's the matter ? Do n't you like snakes ? Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder .
NEIL: You 're in .
SPAZ: Get away from me , okay ?
BOY: Spaz , why do n't you check your pocket , huh ? Come on Spaz I have to brush my teeth
SPAZ: Get a- get off ,

MEEKS: Aww , Charlie .
CHARLIE: Guys , over here .
MEEKS: You 're funny . You 're real funny .

PITTS: Oh God . Clowns .
NEIL: All right , all right , forget the fire . Let 's go gentlemen .
CHARLIE: I 'll second that .
NEIL: `` To put to rout all that was not life , and not , when I had come to die , discover that I had not lived .
CHARLIE: All right , intermission . Dig deep right here . Right here , lay it down
CAMERON: On the mud ? We 're gon na put our food on the mud ?
CHARLIE: Meeks , put your coat down . Picnic blanket .
MEEKS: Yes sir , use Meeks ' coat .
CHARLIE: Do n't keep anything back either . You guys are always bumming my smokes .
NEIL: Raisins ?
KNOX: Yuck .
CHARLIE: Wait a minute , who gave us half a roll ?
PITTS: I 'm eating the other half .
CHARLIE: Come on .
PITTS: You want me to put it back ?
NEIL: It was a dark and rainy night , and this old lady , who had a passion for jigsaw puzzles , sat by herself in her house at her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle . But as she pieced the puzzle together , she ealized , to her astonishment , that the image that was formed was her very own oom . And the figure in the center of the puzzle , as she completed it , was herself . And with trembling hands , she placed the last four pieces and stared in horror at the face of a demented madman at the window . The last thing that this old lady ever heard was the sound of breaking glass .
BOYS: Ohhh… no…
NEIL: This is true , this is true .
CAMERON: I 've got one that 's even better than that .
CHARLIE: Ha !
CAMERON: I do . There 's a young , married couple , and they 're driving through the forest at night on a long trip . And they run out of gas , and there 's a madman on the-
CHARLIE: The thing with the hand-
CAMERON: I love that story .
CHARLIE: I told you that one .
CAMERON: You did not . I got that in camp in sixth grade .
CHARLIE: When were you in six , last year ?
PITTS: `` In a mean abode in the shanking road , lived a man named William Bloat . Now , he had a wife , the plague of his life , who continually got his goat . And one day at dawn , with her nightshift on , he slit her bloody throat . '' The boys laugh .
CHARLIE: You want to hear a real poem ?
MEEKS: What , did you bring one ?
NEIL: You memorized a poem ?
CHARLIE: I did n't memorize a poem . Move up .
MEEKS: An original piece by Charlie Dalton .
KNOX: An original piece .
PITTS: Take center stage .
NEIL: You know this is history . Right ? This is history .
MEEKS: Oh , wow .
CAMERON: Where did you get that ?
NEIL: Wow ! Did you write that ?
CHARLIE: Abraham Cowley . Okay , who 's next ?
NEIL: Alfred Lord Tennyson . Come my friends , 'T is not too late to seek a newer world for my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset . And though we are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven ; that which we are , we are ; One equal temper of heroic hearts , Made weak by time and fate , but strong in will . To strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield .
MEEKS: Then I had religion , then I had a vision . I could not turn from their revel in derision . Then I saw the Congo creeping through the black , cutting through the forest with a golden track . Then I saw the Congo creeping through the black-
CHARLIE: Meeks , Meeks .
KEATING: A man is not very tire , he is exhausted . And do n't use very sad , use- He points to the back of the classroom .
KNOX: Morose ?
KEATING: Exactly ! Morose . Now , language was developed for one endeavor , and that is ? Mr. Anderson ? Come on ! Are you a man o an amoeba ?
NEIL: Uh , to communicate .
KEATING: No ! To woo women . Today we 're going to e talking about William Shakespeare . The class lets out a collective sigh .
BOY: Oh , God !
KEATING: I know . A lot of you looked forward to this about as much as you look forward to root canal work . We 're gon na talk about Shakespeare as someone who writes something very interesting . Now , many of you have seen Shakespeare done very much like this
CHARLIE: To feel taller .

MR. NOLAN: Take a power train in two ! Three ! Keep your eyes in the boat !
MEEKS: We got it , Pittsie . We got it ! Radio Free America !

TODD: Neil , Neil , hold on a minute . How are you gon na be in a play if your fathe wo n't let you ?
NEIL: First I got ta get the part , then I can worry about that .
TODD: Yeah , but wo n't he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition and did n't even tell him ?
NEIL: No , no , no , no . As far as I 'm concerned , he wo n't have to know about any of this .
TODD: Well , that 's impossible .
NEIL: Bullshit ! Nothing 's impossible .
TODD: Well , why do n't you just call him and ask him ? And m-maybe he 'll say yes .
NEIL: That 's a laugh ! Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed .
TODD: Yeah , but if he said
NEIL: Jesus , Todd ! Whose side are you on ?
TODD: I do n't know . Maybe .
NEIL: Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you , does it , Todd ?
TODD: W-What is that supposed to mean ?
NEIL: You 're in the club ! Being in the clu means being stirred up by things . You look about as stirred up as a cesspool .
TODD: So- You want me out ?
NEIL: No ! I want you in , but being in means you got ta do something . Not just say you 're in .
TODD: Well , listen , Neil . I-I appreciate this concern , but I-I 'm not like you . All ight ? You , you , you say thing and people listen . I 'm , I 'm not like that .
NEIL: Do n't you think you could be ?
TODD: No ! II , I do n't know , but that 's not the point . The , the , the point is that there 's nothing you can do about it , so you can just butt out . I can take care of myself just fine . All right ?
NEIL: No .
TODD: What do you mean , `` no '' ? A smile comes to Neil 's face .
NEIL: No .
TODD: Give me Neil . Neil , give that back .

COACH: Okay , everybody on the bus . Let 's go , oys . Come on , let 's go . On the bus , oys . Now !
KEATING: Now , devotees may argue that one sport or game is inherently better than another . For me , sport is actually a chance for us to have other human beings push us to excel . I want you all to come over here and take a slip of paper and line up single file .
PITTS: `` Oh to struggle against great odds . To meet enemies undaunted . ''
KEATING: Sounds to me like you 're daunted . Say it again like you 're undaunted .

BOY 1: Who 's Chris ?
BOY 2: Mmm , Chris .
KNOX: I see a sweetness in her smile . Blight light shines from her eyes . But life is complete ; contentment is mine , Just knowing that Several students begin to snicker .
KEATING: No , no . It 's not stupid . It 's a good effort . It touched on one of the majo themes , love . A major theme not only in poetry , but life . Mr. Hopkins , you were laughing . You 're up .
HOPKINS: `` The cat sat on the mat . ''
KEATING: Congratulations , Mr. Hopkins . Yours is the first poem to ever have a negative score on the Pritchard scale . We 're not laughing at you , we 're laughing nea you . I do n't mind that your poem had a simple theme . Sometimes the most eautiful poetry can be about simple things , like a cat , or a flower or rain . You see , poetry can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it . Just do n't let your poems be ordinary . Now , who 's next ? Keating approaches Todd 's desk .
TODD: I , I did n't do it . I did n't write a poem .
KEATING: Mr. Anderson thinks that everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing . Is n't that right , Todd ? Is n't that your worst fear ? Well , I think you 're wrong . I think you have something inside of you that is worth a great deal .
TODD: A yawp ?
KEATING: No , not just a yawp . A barbaric yawp .
TODD: Yawp .
KEATING: Come on , louder .
TODD: Yawp .

TODD: Uh , uh , a sweaty-toothed madman .
KEATING: Good God , boy , there 's a poet in you , after all . There , close your eyes . Close your eyes . Close 'em . Now , describe what you see .
TODD: Uh , I-I close my eyes .
KEATING: Yes ?
TODD: Uh , and this image floats beside me .

TODD: H-His hands reach out and choke me .
KEATING: That 's it . Wonderful . Wonderful .
TODD: And , and all the time he 's mumbling .

TODD: M-Mumbling , `` Truth . Truth is like , like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold . ''
KEATING: Forget them , forget them . Stay with the lanket . Tell me about that blanket .
TODD: Y-Y-Y-You push it , stretch it , it 'll never be enough . You kick at it , beat it , it 'll never cover any of us . From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying , it will just cover you face as you wail and cry and scream .
KEATING: Do n't you forget this .
CHARLIE: Attaboy , Pittsie , inhale deeply .

KNOX: Well , of course not , Charlie . But that 's not the point . That 's not the point at all .
CHARLIE: What is the point ?
KNOX: The point , Charlie , is , uh
CHARLIE: Yeah ?
KNOX: that she was thinking about me . I 've only met her once , and already she 's thinking about me . Damn it . It 's gon na happen , guys . I feel it . She is going to e mine . Carpe . Carpe !

NEIL: Oh .
TODD: Oh .
NEIL: Maybe they thought you needed anothe one .
TODD: Maybe they were n't thinking about anything at all . Uh , the funny thing is about this is I , I did n't even like it the first time .
NEIL: Todd , I think you 're underestimating the value of this desk set .
TODD: Or a car .
NEIL: Or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one ? I mean , if , if I were ever going to buy a , a desk set twice , I would probably buy this one oth times . In fact , its , its shape is , it 's rather aerodynamic , is n't it ? I can feel it . This desk set wants to fly .
TODD: Oh , my !

MEEKS: Look , uh , it 's , it 's over now .
CHARLIE: Why ? Nobody knows who we are .
CAMERON: Well , do n't you think they 're gon na figure out who wrote it ? They 're gon na come to you and ask to know what the Dead Poets Society is . Charlie , you had no right to do something like that .
CHARLIE: It 's Nuwanda , Cameron .
GLORIA: That 's right . It 's Nuwanda .
CHARLIE: Are we just playing around out here , o do we mean what we say ? For all we do is come together and reach a bunch of poems to each other . What the hell are we doing ?
NEIL: All right , but you still should n't have done it , Charlie . This could mean trouble . You do n't speak for the club .
CHARLIE: Hey , would you not worry about you precious little neck ? If they catch me , I 'll tell them I made it up .
MR. NOLAN: Sit . The students all sit .
CHARLIE: Welton Academy . Hello . Yes , he is . Just a moment .
MR. NOLAN: Wipe that smirk off your face . If you think , Mr. Dalton , that you 're the first to try to get thrown out of this school , think again . Others have had simila notions and have failed just as surely as you will fail . Assume the position .
CHARLIE: One . Two . Three . Four . Five .
MR. NOLAN: What is this Dead Poets Society ? I want names .
NEIL: You kicked out ?
CHARLIE: No .
NEIL: So what happened ?
CHARLIE: I 'm to turn everybody in , apologize to the school and all will be forgiven .
NEIL: So , what are you gon na do ? Charlie !
CHARLIE: Damn it , Neil . The name is Nuwanda . Charlie smiles and then shuts his door .
MR. NOLAN: Excuse me . May we have a word , Mr. Keating ?
KEATING: Certainly .
MR. NOLAN: This was my first classroom , John . Did you know that ? My first desk .
KEATING: Did n't know you taught , Mr. Nolan .
MR. NOLAN: English . Oh , long before your time . It was hard giving it up , I can tell you . I 'm hearing rumors , John , about some unorthodox teaching methods in you classroom . I 'm not saying they 've anything to do with the Dalton boy 's outburst . But I do n't think I have to warn you boys his age are very impressionable .
KEATING: Well , your reprimand made quite an impression , I 'm sure .
MR. NOLAN: What was going on in the courtyard the other day ?
KEATING: Courtyard ?
MR. NOLAN: Yeah . Boys marching , clapping in unison .
KEATING: Oh , that . That was an exercise to prove a point . Dangers of conformity .
MR. NOLAN: Well , John , the curriculum here is set . It 's proven it works . If you question , what 's to prevent them from doing the same ?
KEATING: I always thought the idea of educating was to learn to think for yourself .
MR. NOLAN: At these boys ' ages ? Not on your life ! Tradition , John . Discipline . Prepare them for college , and the rest will take care of itself .
CHARLIE: Creak . He started walking around towards my left . Creak . Creak . `` Assume the position , Mr . Dalton . ''
KEATING: It 's all right , gentlemen .
CHARLIE: Mr. Keating .
KEATING: Mr. Dalton . That was a pretty lame stunt you pulled today .
CHARLIE: You 're siding with Mr. Nolan ? What about Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that ?
KEATING: Sucking the marrow out of life does n't mean choking on the bone . Sure there 's a time for daring and there 's a time fo caution , and a wise man understands which is called for .
CHARLIE: But I thought you 'd like that .
KEATING: No . You being expelled from school is not daring to me . It 's stupid , 'cause you 'll miss some golden opportunities .
CHARLIE: Yeah . Like what ?
KEATING: Like , if nothing else , the opportunity to attend my classes . Got it , Ace ?
CHARLIE: Aye , aye , Captain .
KEATING: Keep your head about you . That goes fo the lot of you .
BOYS: Yes , Captain .
KEATING: Phone call from God . If it had been collect , it would n't been daring .
CHARLIE: All right . Go on .
DIRECTOR: We 're trying to rehearse , okay ? Start .
LYSANDER: A good persuasion , therefore hear me , Hermia .
DIRECTOR: Wait , please . Excitement . I do n't hea any excitement about this play . And take her hand . Bring her down the stage and stop . And `` There , gentle Hermia . '' Okay ? Try again .
BOY: What 's for dinner ?
PITTS: Spaghetti and meatballs !
NEIL: Save some for me . `` But , room , Fairy ! Here comes Oberon . ''
MR. PERRY: Neil .
NEIL: Wait a minute . Before you say anything , please let me ex- Mr. Perry rises from the desk .
MR. PERRY: Do n't you dare talk back to me ! It 's bad enough that you 've wasted your time with this , this absurd acting business . But you deliberately deceived me ! How , how , how did you expect to get away with this ? Answer me . Who put you up to it ? Was it this new man ? This , uh , Mr. Keating ?
NEIL: No . Nobody I thought I 'd surprise you . I 've gotten all A 's in every class .
MR. PERRY: Did you think I was n't going to find out ? `` Oh , my niece is in a play with your son , '' says Mrs. Marks . `` No , no , no , '' I say , `` you must be mistaken . My son 's not in a play . '' You made me a lia of me , Neil ! Now , tomorrow you go to them and you tell them that you 're quitting .
NEIL: No , I ca n't . I have the main part . The performance is tomorrow night .
MR. PERRY: I do n't care if the world comes to an end tomorrow night . You are through with that play . Is that clear ? Is that clear ?
NEIL: Yes , sir .
MR. PERRY: I made a great many sacrifices to get you here , Neil , and you will not let me down .
NEIL: No , sir .
KEATING: It 's open .
NEIL: Can I speak to you a minute ?
KEATING: Certainly . Sit down .
NEIL: I 'm sorry . Here .
KEATING: Excuse me . Get you some tea ?
NEIL: Tea . Sure .
KEATING: Like some milk or sugar in that ?
NEIL: No , thanks .
KEATING: No , it 's part of the monastic oath . They do n't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching .
NEIL: She 's pretty .
KEATING: She 's also in London . Makes it a little difficult .
NEIL: How can you stand it ?
KEATING: Stand what ?
NEIL: You can go anywhere . You can do anything . How can you stand being here ?
KEATING: 'Cause I love teaching . I do n't wan na be anywhere else .
NEIL: I just talked to my father . He 's making me quit the play at Henley Hall . Acting 's everything to me . I But he does n't know . He I can see his point . We 're not a rich family like Charlie 's , and we But he 's planning the rest of my life for me , and I H-He 's neve asked me what I want .
KEATING: Have you ever told your father what you just told me ? About your passion fo acting . You ever show him that ?
NEIL: I ca n't .
KEATING: Why not ?
NEIL: I ca n't talk to him this way .
KEATING: Then you 're acting for him , too . You 're playing the part of the dutiful son . I know this sounds impossible , but you have to talk to him . You have to show him who you are , what your heart is .
NEIL: I know what he 'll say . He 'll tell me that acting 's a whim , and I should forget it . That how they 're counting on me . He 'll just tell me to put it out of my mind , `` for my own good . ''
KEATING: You are not an indentured servant . If it 's not a whim for you , you prove it to him by your conviction and your passion . You show him that And if he still does n't believe you , well , by then you 'll be out of school and you can do anything you want .
NEIL: No . What about the play ? The show 's tomorrow night .
KEATING: Well , you have to talk to him before tomorrow night .
NEIL: Is n't there an easier way ?
KEATING: No .
NEIL: I 'm trapped .
KEATING: No , you 're not .
KNOX: Chris !
GIRL: Um , I think she 's in room 111 .
KNOX: Thanks .
CHRIS: Knox , what are you doing here ?
KNOX: I came to apologize for the other night . I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you .
CHRIS: Knox , do n't you know that , if Chet finds you here he 'll kill you ?
KNOX: I ca n't care . I love you , Chris .
CHRIS: Knox , you 're crazy .
KNOX: Look , I acted like a jerk and I know it . Please , accept these . Please .
CHRIS: No . No I , I ca n't . Forget it .
KNOX: All I 'm asking you to do is listen .
CHARLIE: Get out of here . Cameron , you fool . Charlie notices Knox and grabs his jacket .
KNOX: Yeah .
PITTS: What 'd she say ?
KNOX: Nothing .
CHARLIE: Nothing . What do you mean , nothing ?
KNOX: Nothing . But I did it .
CHARLIE: What did she say ? I know she had to say something .
PITTS: Come here , Knox .
KNOX: Seize the day !
KEATING: Did you talk to your father ?
NEIL: Uh , he did n't like it one bit , but at least he 's letting me stay in the play . He wo n't be able to make , make it . He 's in Chicago . But , uh , I think he 's gon na let me stay with acting .
KEATING: Really ? You told him what you told me ?
NEIL: Yeah . He was n't happy . But he 'll be gone at least four days . I do n't think he 'll make the show , but I think he 'll let me stay with it . `` Keep up the school work . '' Thanks . Neil picks up his books and leaves .
PITTS: Beautiful baby .
MEEKS: Beautiful baby . Henley Hall , here I come .
CAMERON: Excuse me , just a moment . Yes . You 're so cute .
TODD: Come on , Nuwanda . You 're gon na miss Neil 's entrance .
PITTS: He said something about getting red efore we left .
CAMERON: Getting red ? What does that mean ?
PITTS: I , uh Well , you know Charlie .
CAMERON: So , Charlie , what 's this `` getting red '' it ?
TODD: W-What is that ?
CHARLIE: It 's an Indian warrior symbol fo virility . Makes me feel potent , like it can drive girls crazy .
TODD: Oh , come on , Charlie . The girls are waiting .
KNOX: Chris . Knox leaves the other boys to join her .
CHARLIE: Yeah , come on , guys .
KNOX: Chris , you ca n't be in here . I-If they catch you , we 're both gon na be in big trouble .
CHRIS: Oh , but it 's fine Knox shushes her and leads her out the door .
KNOX: I did n't mean to make a fool out of you .
CHRIS: Well , you did . Chet found out . And it took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you . Knox , you have got to stop this stuff .
KNOX: I ca n't , Chris . I love you .
CHRIS: Knox , you say that over and over . You do n't , you do n't even know me . Keating calls out from a nearby car .
KEATING: Will you be joining us , Mr. Overstreet ?
KNOX: Go ahead , Captain . I 'll walk .
CHRIS: Knox , Knox , it just so happens that I could care less about you ?
KNOX: Then you would n't be here warning me about Chet .
CHRIS: I have to go . I 'm gon na be late for the play .
KNOX: Are you going with him ?
CHRIS: Chet ? To a play ? Are you kidding ?
KNOX: Then come with me .
CHRIS: Knox , you are so infuriating .
KNOX: Come on , Chris . Just give me one chance . If you do n't like me after tonight , I 'll stay away forever .
CHRIS: Uh-huh .
KNOX: I promise . Dead Poets Honor . You come with me tonight . And then , if you do n't want to see me again , I swear I 'll bow out .
CHRIS: You know what would happen if Chet found out ?
KNOX: He wo n't know anything . We 'll sit in the ack and sneak away as soon as it 's over .
CHRIS: And I suppose you would promise that this would be the end of it .
KNOX: Dead Poets Honor .
CHRIS: What is that ?
KNOX: My word .
CHRIS: You are so infuriating .
CHARLIE: Hey , there he is ! Hey , hey . Cameron shoves him back into his seat .
KEATING: Shh , boys .

DIRECTOR: Neil . That 's your cue , Neil . Come on , Neil . Here 's your crown . Let 's go .

KEATING: Do n't make it any worse than it is .
CHARLIE: Is it okay if we walk back ? Captain ? Charlie motions Todd to follow .
MR. PERRY: We 're trying very hard to understand why it is that you insist on defying us . Whatever the reason , we 're not gon na let you ruin your life . Tomorrow I 'm withdrawing you from Welton and enrolling you in Braden Military School . You 're going to Harvard and you 're gon na e a doctor .
NEIL: But that 's ten more years . Father , that 's a lifetime !
MR. PERRY: Oh , stop it . Do n't be so dramatic . You make it sound like a prison term . You do n't understand , Neil . You have opportunities that I never even dreamt of and I am not going to let you waste them . Neil rises to his feet .
NEIL: I 've got to tell you what I feel . Mrs. Perry stands up .
MRS. PERRY: We 've been so worried about
MR. PERRY: What ? What ? Tell me what you feel . What is it ?
NEIL: Nothing . Neil sits back down dejectedly .
MR. PERRY: Nothing ? Well , then , let 's go to bed .

CHARLIE: Todd .
TODD: His father killed him . He made him do it .
MEEKS: You ca n't explain it , Todd .
CHARLIE: Leave him be .
BOYS: All my life Thy light shall surely follow me And in God 's house forevermore My dwelling place shall be Amen .
MR. NOLAN: The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy . He was a fine student . One of Welton 's est . And he will be missed . We 've contacted each of your parents to explain the situation . Naturally , they 're all quite concerned . At the equest of Neil 's family , I intend to conduct a thorough inquiry into this matter . Your complete cooperation is expected .
CHARLIE: You told him about this meeting ?
PITTS: Twice .
CHARLIE: That 's it , guys . We 're all fried .
PITTS: How do you mean ?
CHARLIE: Cameron 's a fink . He 's in Nolan 's office ight now , finking .
PITTS: About what ?
CHARLIE: The club , Pittsie . Think about it . The oard of directors , the trustees and Mr. Nolan . Do you think for one moment they 're gon na let this thing just blow over ? Schools go down because of things like this . They need a scapegoat .
CAMERON: What 's going on , guys ?
CHARLIE: You finked , did n't you , Cameron ?
CAMERON: Finked ? I did n't know what the hell you 're talking about .
CHARLIE: You told Nolan everything about the clu is what I 'm talking about .
CAMERON: Look , in case you had n't heard , Dalton , there 's something called an honor code at this school , all right ? If a teache asks you a question , you tell the truth or you 're expelled .
CHARLIE: You little-
MEEKS: Charlie !
CHARLIE: He 's a rat ! He 's in it up to his eyes , so he rattled to save himself .
KNOX: Do n't touch him , Charlie . You do and you 're out .
CHARLIE: I 'm out anyway !
KNOX: You do n't know that , not yet .
CAMERON: He 's right there , Charlie . And if you guys are smart , you will do exactly what I did and cooperate . They 're not afte us . We 're the victims . Us and Neil .
CHARLIE: What 's that mean ? Who are they after ?
CAMERON: Why , Mr. Keating , of course . The `` Captain '' himself . I mean , you guys did n't really think he could avoid esponsibility , did you ?
CHARLIE: Mr. Keating responsible for Neil ? Is that what they 're saying ?
CAMERON: Well , who else do you think , dumb ass ? The administration ? Mr. Perry ? Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap , did n't he ? If he was n't for Mr. Keating , Neil would be cozied up in his room ight now , studying his chemistry and dreaming of being called doctor .
TODD: That is not true , Cameron . You know that . He did n't put us to anything . Neil loved acting .
CAMERON: Believe what you want , but I say let Keating fry . I mean , why ruin our lives ?
HAGER: Knox Overstreet .
TODD: Meeks ?
MEEKS: Go away . I have to study .
TODD: What happened to Nuwanda ?
MEEKS: Expelled .
TODD: What 'd you tell 'em ?
MEEKS: Nothing they did n't already know .
MR. ANDERSON: Hello , son .
MRS. ANDERSON: Hello , darling .
TODD: Mom .
MR. NOLAN: Have a seat , Mr. Anderson . Todd sits down next to his parents .
MR. ANDERSON: Answer him , Todd .
TODD: Yes , sir .
MR. NOLAN: I have here a detailed description of what occurred at your meetings . It describes how your teacher , Mr. Keating , encouraged you boys to organize this club and to use it as a source of inspiration for reckless and self- indulgent behavior . It describes how Mr. Keating , both in and out of the classroom , encouraged Neil Perry to follow his obsession with acting when he knew all along it was against the explicit order of Neil 's parents . It was Mr. Keating 's blatant abuse of his position as teacher that led directly to Neil Perry 's death .
TODD: What 's gon na happen to Mr. Keating ?
MR. ANDERSON: I 've had enough . Sign the paper , Todd . Mr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take .
MR. NOLAN: Sit .
TODD: Uh , in the , in the Pr-
MR. NOLAN: I ca n't hear you , Mr. Anderson .
TODD: In the , in the , in the Pritchard ?
MR. NOLAN: Kindly inform me , Mr. Cameron .
CAMERON: We skipped around a lot , sir . We covered the Romantics and some of the chapters on Post Civil War literature .
MR. NOLAN: What about the Realists ?
CAMERON: I believe we skipped most of that , sir .
MR. NOLAN: All right , then , we 'll start over . What is poetry ? There is a knock at the classroom door .
KEATING: Excuse me . I came for my personals . Should I come back after class ?
MR. NOLAN: Get them now , Mr. Keating .
CAMERON: That page has been ripped out , sir .
MR. NOLAN: Well , borrow somebody else 's book .
CAMERON: They 're all ripped out , sir .
MR. NOLAN: What do you mean , they 're all ripped out ?
CAMERON: Sir , we , uh-
MR. NOLAN: Never mind .
CAMERON: `` Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans Pritchard , Ph.D. To fully understand poetry , we must first be fluent with its meter , rhyme and figures of speech , then ask two questions 1 ) How artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2 ) ''
TODD: Mr. Keating ! They made everybody sign it .
MR. NOLAN: Quiet , Mr. Anderson .
TODD: You got ta believe me . It 's true .
KEATING: I do believe you , Todd .
MR. NOLAN: Leave , Mr. Keating .
TODD: But it was n't his fault !
MR. NOLAN: Sit down , Mr. Anderson ! Todd reluctantly returns to his seat .
TODD: O Captain ! My Captain !
MR. NOLAN: Sit down , Mr. Anderson !
KNOX: O Captain ! My Captain !
MR. NOLAN: Mr. Overstreet , I warn you ! Sit down !

WADE: OK , he apologized hakuna his tatas Vanessa lets Buck go , turns on Wade .
VANESSA: And you- Hands off the merchandise .
WADE: Merchandise ? So , what , you , uh , bump fuzzies for money ?
VANESSA: Yup .
WADE: Rough childhood ?
VANESSA: Rougher than yours . Daddy left before I was born .
WADE: Daddy left before I was conceived .
VANESSA: Ever had a cigarette put out on you skin ?
WADE: I did n't know there was any other place to put one out .
VANESSA: I was molested .
WADE: Me too . Uncle .
VANESSA: Uncles . They took turns .
WADE: I watched my own birthday party from the keyhole of a locked closet , which was also my-
VANESSA: Bedroom ? Lucky . I slept in a dishwashe ox .
WADE: So you had a dishwasher . I did n't know sleep . It was pretty much 24-7 of ball gags , brownie mix , and fun-house mirrors .
VANESSA: Who would do such a thing ?
WADE: Hopefully you . Later tonight . And my Uncle Kevin . Wade EMPTIES the rest of Gavin 's wallet
VANESSA: About forty-eight minutes of whatever you want And a low-fat dessert .
WADE: Time to put balls in holes .
WADE: Tough call . Just trying to get to know the real you not the plunging- necklined , short-shorted , two-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood .
BOY: Nice tits !
VANESSA: Thank you , son . You know how to make a woman feel special .
WADE: Prepare to lose tragically .
VANESSA: Bring it , big man .
WADE: The limited edition Voltron Defender of the Universe ring , por favor .
TEEN: You 're roughly three hundred thousand tickets short . It 's nickel-silver-plated .
WADE: Then I guess the tire-grade rubbe Voltron keychain .
VANESSA: And the pencil eraser .
TEEN: You are now the sworn protector of the gentle people of the planet Arus And you you can erase stuff written in pencil . Wade extends his arm chivalrously
WADE: M'lady ?
VANESSA: Unfortunately , my anus-loving friend , your forty-eight minutes are up .
WADE: Arus . And you 're more evil than evil King Zarkon himself .

VANESSA: Limited edition . I had to give the kid ehind the counter a rub and tug . I 'm kidding . I 'm not kidding . I 'm kidding . It was nearly five full months of Skeeball .
WADE: Y'know , I 've been doing some thinking
VANESSA: Really .
WADE: about why we 're so good together .
VANESSA: Why 's that ?
WADE: Your crazy matches my crazy . We 're like two jigsaw pieces weird curvy edges ut fit us together , you can see the picture on top .
VANESSA: Hey , I 've been meaning to ask you , only ` cause you have n't gotten around to asking me- Wade , will you-
WADE: They say one month 's salary .
VANESSA: You mean- ?

VANESSA: I did . At my old job .
WADE: So that 's a- ?
VANESSA: Easy . I can take it back .
WADE: What if I never let go ?
VANESSA: Just rode a bitch 's back , like Yoda on Luke ?
WADE: ` Star Wars ' jokes ? !
VANESSA: ` Empire . '
WADE: It 's like I made you in a computer .
DOCTOR: People react to news of late-stage cance differently .
VANESSA: So what do we do ? Surely there 's something we can do . I mean , my uncle , he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer , and there was this new experimental drug that-
DOCTOR: Take your time to process this .
DEADPOOL: You know how many people I 've killed to find you ?
AJAX: Actually , I do .
DEADPOOL: So you 're aware I 've been waiting a long , long time for this . And now I 'm finally gon na
VANESSA: Wham ?
WADE: Wham ! ` Make it Big ' was the album George and Andy earned their exclamation point .
VANESSA: So I 'm s'posed to just smile and wave you out the door ?
WADE: Think of it as a spring cleaning . Only if spring was death . ( pulls out BERNADETTE PETERS
CHANGE PURSE: If I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters . Looks like I do .
VANESSA: Bernadette 's not going anywhere . ` Cause you 're not going anywhere .
WADE: Right ! The tumors are only in my liver , lungs , prostate , and brain . All the things you can live without .
VANESSA: You know what I mean . You belong here at home . Surrounded by your Voltron and your Bernadette and your me .
WADE: Babe , we 've been through this ! Cancer 's a real shit-show . A Yakov-Smirnoff- opening-for-the-Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa- State-Fair shit-show . And under no circumstances will I take you to that show . I want you to remember me me .
VANESSA: Well , I want to remember us us . We we ?
WADE: I swear , I 'll find you in the next life . And boom-box ` Careless Whisper ' unde your window . Wham !
VANESSA: Are you gon na keep saying it like that ? Look , I get this impulse . I do .
WADE: Super fucking bad-ass .
VANESSA: But that was then , and this is now . Walk out that door . I dare you . I will ride you out . And I wo n't let go . Yoda on Luke .
WADE: I just realized ! I win ! My life 's officially more fucked-up than yours .
VANESSA: No one 's boom-boxing shit .
WADE: Nothing . Everything . Vanessa leans in , and the two start to KISS .
WADE: Sorry . Liam Neeson nightmare . I kidnapped his daughter , and he just was n't having it . Wade slides back into bed .
WEASEL: Jesus . Someone needs a blow-job and a shower . Though courtesy calls for the latter first .
WADE: Three shots of Patron Silver , Weez . And a cure to terminal cancer .
WEASEL: Fresh out of Patron . Wheatgrass ?
WADE: You 're starting to sound like Vanessa
WEASEL: This belongs on the wall . I want to emember you when you looked alive .
BEEF: Wade .
WADE: Forget your scythe ? The man , even creepier from close up , SMILES .
RECRUITER: Mr. Wilson . Have a seat . I understand you 've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer .
WADE: Stalker alert .
RECRUITER: It 's my job . Recruitment . And you have quite a reputation . I 'm sorry you 've had a tough go . But you 're a fighter . And not just for Johnny Canuck , impressive as your stint in special forces was . Forty- one confirmed kills ?
WADE: One every seven weeks . Same rate most folks get a hair-cut .
RECRUITER: Now you spend your days sticking up fo the little man , slitting small time throats for small time folks .
WADE: People change .
RECRUITER: Speaking of which Mr. Wilson , I epresent an organization that may be able to help . What if I told you we can cure your cancer ? And what 's more , give you abilities most men only dream of ?
WADE: I 'd say you sound like an infomercial . And not a good infomercial , like Slap Chop . More Shake-Weighty .
RECRUITER: The world needs extraordinary men . We wo n't just make you better . We 'll make you better than better . A super-hero .
WADE: I already tried the hero business . Let 's just say it left a mark . The only chance you 'll see me again is if I hit ` fuck- it . '
WADE: De donde eres ?
ELDERLY WOMAN: Boca Raton .
WADE: Ah . The fancy part of Mexico .
ELDERLY MAN: We 've moved in with my son . To afford the treatment . Wade looks pained to hear this .
WADE: Cancer ? Sorry - ¿El Cáncer ?
ELDERLY MAN: Stage four .
WADE: Toughest part of the Tour de France .
VANESSA: Very hilly .
ELDERLY MAN: Logging some frequent flier miles ?
WADE: Final stop on Desperation World Tour , 2016 , which I believe was also the name of the Stones ' last concert
VANESSA: ` Final ' because this is where we find the cure .
NURSE: No cheques de viajero . No pesos . Cash . Americano .
NURSE: Señor Abe Solomon ?
ABE: Handsome couple . Good luck to you two .
WADE: Good luck to you , Pops .
DOCTOR: Buenos días , Señor Abe .
ABE: I 'm sorry . No hablo español , doc .
DOCTOR: De que se cure ! Señor Abe , you are cured .
ABE: Thank you . I owe you my life .
DOCTOR: ¡Proximo ! Next !
DOCTOR: So sorry , you surprise me . How long you standing there , Señor ?
WADE: Long enough
DEADPOOL: Thank you , Agent Smith .
WADE: Worse . Just promise you 'll do right by me . So I can do right by someone else .
RECRUITER: Of course .
WADE: Oh , and please do n't make my super suit green . Or animated .
RECRUITER: I hope you enjoy your stay .
WADE: Um . My first request ? A warmer table . And warmer hands .
ANGEL DUST: You 'd like that , huh . Welcome to ou little hospital .
WADE: It does n't look like a hospital . It looks like Chlamydia holding still .
ANGEL DUST: Shut . The fuck . Up .
WADE: Can I expect turndown serv- ?
AJAX: You 're a talker . Wade 's eyes are wider than ever . WTF ?
ANGEL DUST: What , you expected Weapon X ? Ajax starts to TURN AWAY , but stops .
AJAX: One more thing . What 's the ad ? ` I 'm not just the president . I 'm a client ? ' I 've een through this procedure myself . It made me stronger . It also scorched my nerve endings . So I no longer feel pain . In fact I no longer feel anything .
WADE: Something in your teeth .
AJAX: Joke away . The one thing that neve survives this place is a sense of humor .
WADE: We 'll see !
AJAX: All yours .
JOHN DENVER: I want to share what I can give . I want to be I want to live !
AJAX: Until you finally mutate . Or die .
WADE: Puppies .
CUNNINGHAM: Or kittens . If you swing that way .
WADE: I swing both ways . Wade swallows hard , grows serious
CUNNINGHAM: A bucket list ?
WADE: I prefer fuck-it list Naked tandem base- jumping with the WNBA 's Sacramento Monarchs Sparking up a spliff with the Olympic torch
CUNNINGHAM: Finishing my Lego Millenium Falcon
WADE: Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven
CUNNINGHAM: Making my kids banana pancakes
AJAX: You are so relentlessly annoying . Shut the fuck up , or I 'll sew that pretty mouth shut .
WADE: Uh , I would n't do that . Here 's the problem with round-the-clock torture . You ca n't really step it up from there .
AJAX: Is that what you think ?
WADE: Yeah . Francis . That 's what I think .
AJAX: Seems your genes are as stubborn as you . But we can still increase your suffering . We do n't even have a name for this next toy .
WADE: Um . What ?
AJAX: Waterboarding is the most severe stress known to man . This device prolongs that stress . For hours , days , weeks
ANGEL DUST: Or if you keep yapping , years
WADE: And I thought you were dicks before this .
AJAX: The saddest part ? You still think we 're making you a super-hero . You . Dishonorable discharge . Beating up pizza guys . Hip deep in hookers . You 're nothing . I 'd call you an asshole , but I 'd have to answer to assholes . Little secret , Wade . The Workshop does n't make super-heroes . It makes super-slaves . We 're gon na fit you for a control colla and auction you to the highest bidder . Who knows what they 'll force you to do . Put down freedom fighters . Murde innocents . Or maybe just mow a lawn o two .
ANGEL DUST: There 's a brave face . Ajax goes to close the lid .
WADE: Seriously . Now you do have something in your teeth .
AJAX: Enjoy the weekend !
ANGEL DUST: He looks like a turd in a punch-bowl .
AJAX: The ` Punch-Bowl ! '
DOCTOR: Mr. Wilson these results are emarkable . Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of AIR .
WADE: Yippee .
DOCTOR: But the cells have inalterably changed . They 're no longer destructive , ut productive , selectively targeting and eplacing damaged tissue .
WADE: That was a lot of what 's the word syllables . Are you saying I 'm better ?
DOCTOR: Better than better . A miracle .
WADE: My Mom used to call me that .
DOCTOR: There . There . Your journey 's been long and difficult . But you 've become something extraordinary . Just rest now . Rest .
AJAX: Oo . Someone lost his shot at homecoming king .
WADE: You f-fucking sadistic-
AJAX: No . Not fair . Everything I 've done to you has been in your best interest . Even this next bit . You may be cured , but you still need to learn to be a better man . Polite . Respectful . What better way to teach you than to close this lid and keep torturing you stupid .
ANGEL DUST: Better to be the hunter than the hunted .
AJAX: Either I kill him , or he kills me . Let 's put him out of our misery
DEADPOOL: There all caught up . He CLIMBS up and out of the GARBAGE TRUCK .
BLIND AL: Ass-hat .
DEADPOOL: Morning , roomie ! This place reeks like old lady pants .
BLIND AL: Yes . I 'm old . I wear pants .
DEADPOOL: But you 're no lady .
BLIND AL: Upside of being blind I 've never seen you in Crocs .
DEADPOOL: You mean my big rubber masturbatin ' shoes ?
BLIND AL: Yes I know . Downside of being blind I hear everything in this duplex .
DEADPOOL: One-thousand eight-hundred twenty-two ornaments pinned to two-hundred-sixty calendars . All for a ` Christmas ' that never came !
BLIND AL: Too much naughty , too little nice .
DEADPOOL: Sit on a stick .
BLIND AL: Bactine ?
DEADPOOL: Yeah . Bactine should do it . How 's the Kullen coming ? IKEA does n't assemble itself .
BLIND AL: You 're telling me . I do n't mind the Kullen . It 's an improvement on the Hurdal .
DEADPOOL: Anything 's an improvement on the Hurdal . I 'd have taken a Hemnes or even a Trysil over the Hurdal . But I did n't get excited ` til I saw the Kullen .
BLIND AL: Screw please .
DEADPOOL: Here ? Now ? Just kidding . I know it 's een decades for you .
BLIND AL: You 'd be surprised .
DEADPOOL: And totally grossed out !
BLIND AL: Ta . Dah .
DEADPOOL: And I quote ` Looking for roommate . Blind to life 's imperfections . Must be good with hands . ' Or wouldya rather I uild IKEA and you pay rent ?
BLIND AL: Why such a douche this morning ?
DEADPOOL: Let 's recap . That cock-thistle who turned me into this freak the one I 've een waiting five years for slipped through my arms today . Arm .
BLIND AL: I 'm gon na find this ` Craig . ' And I 'm gon na kill him .
DEADPOOL: Once I 've got the cure , I 'm gon na do the same to Francis
AJAX: Bloody hell . Someone lost his shot at homecoming king .
WADE: What have you done to me ? !
AJAX: You give me too much credit . This this is the result of your genes .
WADE: You sadistic fuck !
AJAX: Where 's the gratitude ? ! You 're cured ! Your mutated cells can heal anything . They 're attacking the cancer as fast as it can form . Your insides are a wa zone . Not to mention your outsides !
ANGEL: You smell like shit .
AJAX: Whoa .
AJAX: You ca n't kill me , Wade . I 'm the only one who can fix that ugly mug .
WADE: Then time to make me me again .
AJAX: Say it . ` Francis . '
MOTHER: Alex , do n't stare .
DEADPOOL: In the whole wide world , there 's nothing as ugly as fear .
DEADPOOL: Do n't make me ask twice . Where 's Francis ? !
BLIND AL: Seltzer water and lemon for blood . Or wear red .
DEADPOOL: Do n't make me ask twice . Where's-
THUG: I do n't speak Spanish .
DEADPOOL: And I do n't have time for you to learn . Deadpool kills the thug .
HENCHMAN: Why the red suit ?
DEADPOOL: That 's so bad guys can't- never mind , they 've already heard that .
GOON: I do n't know , I 'm telling you . You 're just going to have to kill me .
DEADPOOL: OK . Right ? !
DEADPOOL: I do n't feel good about myself . But where is he ? I 'm so sorry .
DEADPOOL: Come out , come out , wherever you are ! Do n't make me ask tw- Good for you !
RECRUITER: To whom should I address my desperate argaining ?
DEADPOOL: Do n't recognize the voice ? Maybe the esumé Forty-one confirmed kills . Make that Eighty-nine . Seven the past week alone . Same rate most folks get a shave .
RECRUITER: Mr Wilson ?
DEADPOOL: Ding-ding-ding ! Now you 're about to tell me where I can find your boss . O I 'm gon na make you feel worse . Wait
RECRUITER: And I pride myself on being persuasive .
WADE: No no way ! I 'm not making her life as ugly as mine !
WEASEL: C'mon , you ca n't look that bad ! It 's like that blemish no one notices but you .
WADE: Wrong . I 'm a monster , inside and out . I elong in a circus , the kind that rolls around Eastern Europe in covered wagons .
WEASEL: I ca n't envision a scenario where Vanessa wo n't take you ba- -aaaaaccckkk ! ! Holy shit . You are terrifying . You look like an avocado had sex with an older avocado .
WADE: And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug , the asshole who ran that mutant factory , escaped to who knows where .
WEASEL: I take back the Vanessa thing . You have only one option .
WADE: Find Francis-Go-Fuck-Himself .
WEASEL: Star in low budget horror movies . Seriously , you look like Freddy Kruege face-fucked a topographical map of Utah .
WADE: I 'm gon na work my way through his crew crushing bad guys ' skulls , ` til one of ` em leads me to Francis . Then I 'll force him to cure this face . Stomp his bloody guts into a fine vintage . And win Vanessa back .
WEASEL: OK. Not exactly the plot of Beauty and the Beast , but cool . Good news , that douche thinks you 're dead . Advantage you . He wo n't think you 're coming . Bad news , with a puss like that , you 'll be spotted fast .
WADE: So what do you suggest ? A mask ?
WEASEL: Not a bad idea ! You are haunting . Your face is the stuff of nightmares .
WADE: Like a testicle with teeth .
WEASEL: How ` bout a super-suit ? And a nickname ! Bitter-Boy . Super-Fist . Captain Never- Die .
WADE: What ?
WEASEL: Nothing . It 's just you know , I just ealized , I 'm never winning the-
WADE: Deadpool .
WEASEL: Deadpool . To you , Mr . Pool . The two CLINK GLASSES .
DEADPOOL: Santa Claus is coming
BLIND AL: I hope you 're doing us the courtesy of pants .
DEADPOOL: Taxi !
WOMAN: Keep the change .
DOPINDER: Where do you want to be going !
DEADPOOL: And we all know how this turned out . Cue Benny Hill speed
ANGEL DUST: For your flight .
AJAX: Wade Fucking Wilson .
ANGEL DUST: Makes perfect sense .
AJAX: I suppose if I looked like him , I 'd wea a mask too . Only wish I mended the same .
ANGEL DUST: And if he heals ?
AJAX: He ca n't - if there 's nothing left of him to heal . And then we go back to business as usual .
DEADPOOL: There . All caught up .
DEADPOOL: You can stick that where you stuck the Bactine ! I found my stash of wisdom- tooth Percocet in the Storjorm , and I 'm orbiting Saturn . But I appreciate the gesture .
BLIND AL: Am I crazy , or is your hand really small ?
DEADPOOL: The size of a KFC spork .
BLIND AL: Eesh . I get why you 're so pissy . But your mood 's never gon na brighten ` til you find this woman you love and tell her how you feel !
DEADPOOL: What do I keep saying , Mrs. Magoo ? She would n't have me ! If you could see me , you 'd understand .
BLIND AL: Love is blind , Wade .
DEADPOOL: No , you 're blind .
BLIND AL: What was that ?
DEADPOOL: A clue why our Ivar shelving unit 's about to fall the fuck apart .
BLIND AL: So you 're just gon na lie there and whimper ?
DEADPOOL: Just clocking time ` til this arm plows through puberty . I 've got a new Christmas Day .
WEASEL: Wade , we got a problem . And by we I mean you .
DEADPOOL: I 'm about to lose what 's left of my shit . Is there a word for half-afraid , half- furious ?
WEASEL: Afurious ? Wait , is it Monday ? ! They have an amazing Matzah Ball Soup Monday . Never mind . Have you figured what you 're gon na tell her ?
DEADPOOL: Fuck .
WEASEL: It 's a start .
STAN LEE: Coming onto the stage , give it up for Chastity !
WEASEL: Or as I like to call her , Irony !
DEADPOOL: We got ta find her fast . Before fuck-ass .
WEASEL: How do you even know she 's here ?
DEADPOOL: I come for the French Onion Soup . How do you think ? I 'm constantly stalking that fox . Deadpool STOPS in his tracks , STARING .
DEADPOOL: Lezzdothis . Before I re-reconsider . Maximum effort .
MANAGER: Someone out back asking for you . Said somethin ' about an old boyfriend ?
VANESSA: I knew it was you .
AJAX: You have Wade Wilson to thank for this . Vanessa 's eyes widen in shock and surprise .
WEASEL: Manager said she went that way . Good luck , Tiger !
DEADPOOL: Mother-fucker best be wearing his brown pants .
AJAX: That 's what I thought , but he keeps on coming back . Like a Bad Jesus . But despite all Wade 's powers , I still hold the advantage He feels . Too strongly for his own good . Let 's see how he fights with your head on the block .
DEADPOOL: Ripley from ` Alien 3 ' !
NTW: Deadfool .
DEADPOOL: It 's like you knew I was about to knock ! Is that big steel dildo home ?
NTW: You guys going for a bite ? Early bird special ?
DEADPOOL: Like there 's something wrong with eating efore sundown . Or saving money . But no . It 's about me saving my girl from a ad guy , the one you two helped me lose . You do fight bad guys ? No time for hard stares , are you gon na fetch big-shiny-balls or not ? Tell him I have an offer he ca n't refuse ! NTW turns , disappears into the house .
NTW: Colossus !
DEADPOOL: Yep , that 's me , seeing the error of my ways ! I just need an itty bitty favor in eturn ! Fool him five times ? Shame on him .
WEASEL: That 's about three thousand shells .
DEADPOOL: And we 've all seen what I can do with twelve . BLIND AL enters , holding a STEYR AUG RIFLE .
BLIND AL: I was gon na spend tonight assembling the Borgsjo , but this is holding my interest .
DEADPOOL: Careful , Ronnie Milsap , we 're down-range ! And we decided on the Orrberg , not the Borgsjo .
BLIND AL: Shit .
WEASEL: She cool ?
DEADPOOL: The coolest . Plus , she could never pick you out of a line-up .
WEASEL: That 's the shit emoji . A turd with a smile , see ? How did Google ever approve that ?
BLIND AL: That 's every piece in the house .
DEADPOOL: Uh-uh-uh .
BLIND AL: It was him or me . I did hit it , right ?
DEADPOOL: Please . It 's been years since you 've hit anything . See what I did there ?
BLIND AL: Fuck you .
DEADPOOL: In case I never see you again , I love you very much and there 's a hundred-ten million dollars buried somewhere in the apartment . Good luck . Watch your face . Deadpool slams the door behind him .
DEADPOOL: Any luck winning Gita back ?
DOPINDER: I tried to hold on tight , Mr . Pool . But Bandhu is more craftier - and handsomer - than me .
DEADPOOL: It 's all relative .
DOPINDER: I can not be stopping .
DEADPOOL: You mean ESP . But come on ! I coulda-
DEADPOOL: Gaaaahhhh ! Deadpool literally BOUNCES in frustration .
DOPINDER: Who brought this twinkly man ?
DEADPOOL: Twinkly , but deadly . My big Russki friend does n't like the idea of a whole new army of mutant mutton-heads . And I told him if he did me this solid , I 'd consider joining his boy band .
COLOSSUS: It 's not a boy band .
DEADPOOL: Sure it 's not .
DOPINDER: Oh , that ? That was Bandhu .
COLOSSUS: Bandwho ?
DOPINDER: My romantic rival , Bandhu . He 's tied up in the trunk . I 'm doing as you said , D.P . I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish . Then dump his lifeless corpse on Gita 's doorstep like a cat with a dead ird . Mom and Dad will be over the moon . Deadpool looks back at Colossus and shrugs .
DEADPOOL: Something must 've gotten lost in the translation .
DEADPOOL: For you ? Ten .
DOPINDER: Knock em dead , Pool Boy . Deadpool and Dopinder SLAP BOTH HANDS .
DEADPOOL: Time to make the chimichangas .
DEADPOOL: Gahhhhhhh !
DOPINDER: Bandhu ?
DEADPOOL: Goddamnit ! Never mind . Nothing that ca n't be fixed by two swords and maximum effort . Gim me a beat !
DEADPOOL: Long term , that 's hard on your knees .
COLOSSUS: I 'd prefer not to hit a woman . So please place your hands behind your-
DEADPOOL: I also brought her .
ANGEL DUST: Never mind . Fire .
DEADPOOL: Finish fucking her the fuck up . Colossus stops , annoyed .
COLOSSUS: Language . Please .
AJAX: How does it feel ? Ex-boyfriend abandons you , becomes a sanity-challenged kille mutant in tights
VANESSA: Says the sanity-challenged killer mutant in parachute pants . P.S . I 've neve played the role of damsel in distress .
AJAX: ` Til now . Ajax yanks Vanessa away from the edge again .
DEADPOOL: Hey , fellas , whoa ! Hold on ! Don'tcha wan na hear my terms ? !
COLOSSUS: Uh you seem to have , um
DEADPOOL: Tea-bag ! Bob ? !
BOB: Wade ? !
DEADPOOL: It 's been since Jacksonville !
BOB: TGIFridays .
DEADPOOL: Liked the Loaded Potato Skins . Did n't like you .
BOB: Ditto .
DEADPOOL: Bob , y'mind taking a half-step right ? No , your right . Never mind-
AJAX: That never gets old . But neither will you . Right on cue
DEADPOOL: Light the candle
VANESSA: Wade ?
AJAX: What better way to climb back in you head
DEADPOOL: You never left .
VANESSA: But you did , asshole .
AJAX: You two have a lot to work out . Take a deep breath . Wait . Wrong choice
DEADPOOL: I hope they blocked pain to your every last nerve . ` Cause I 'm ' a go looking .
AJAX: I hear you grow back parts . When I get done parts will have to grow back you .
DEADPOOL: Good one .
DEADPOOL: Yowww !
AJAX: Fine . Fists .
DEADPOOL: Sounds like your last Saturday night . The sense of humor survived .
JOHN DENVER: I want to liiiiiive !
ANGEL DUST: C'mere , ya little bitch .
VANESSA: If we survive this . I 'm gon na kill you .
DEADPOOL: We have so much to catch up on .
COLOSSUS: You 're OK. Take it slow .
DEADPOOL: I 'm good .
AJAX: Sorry . It 's just . All this time , you ought that I have the cure ? I 'm flattered . But do I really look like the scientist type ? You want the guy behind the guy . His name 's Dr. Killebrew . And he 's long gone . Who knows where .
DEADPOOL: Um . What ?
AJAX: You heard me .
DEADPOOL: You mean to say , after five long years , I 've been chasing the wrong monkey ?
AJAX: Sounds even stupider when you say it .
DEADPOOL: Like the kind of stupid who admits he ca n't do the one thing I 'm keeping him alive for ? Any last words ? Good . I got one Francis .
DEADPOOL: I 'm sorry ?
COLOSSUS: Four or five moments . That 's all it takes
DEADPOOL: To ?
COLOSSUS: Be a hero . Everyone thinks it 's a full time job . Wake up a hero . Brush you teeth a hero . Go to work a hero . Not true . Over a lifetime , there are only four or five moments that really matter . Moments when you 're offered a choice . To make a sacrifice . Conquer a flaw . Save a friend . Spare an enemy .
DEADPOOL: You were droning on ! I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread , but at least we 've heard the last of him . If wearing super-hero tights means sparing psychopaths , maybe I was n't meant to wear ` em . Not everyone monitors a hall like you .
COLOSSUS: Just promise-
DEADPOOL: I 'll be on the lookout for the next fou moments .
NTW: Now if you 'll excuse me . I 'm just a oy about to stand in front of a girl and tell her- what the fuck am I gon na tell her ? !
VANESSA: Gratuitous . Worth it .
DEADPOOL: Anyone else turned on ? That 's what I love about y-
VANESSA: Start talking .
DEADPOOL: I 'm so sorry . For leaving . And taking so long to cowboy up . It 's been a rough few years .
VANESSA: Rough ?
DEADPOOL: I live in a crack house . With a family of twelve . At night , we spoon fo warmth . Everyone fights for Noelle . She 's the fattest .
VANESSA: So you live in a house !
DEADPOOL: I woulda found you before now . But the guy behind this mask is n't the same guy you remember .
VANESSA: You mean this mask ?
DEADPOOL: And this one . In case the other fell off .
VANESSA: You mean like this ? Vanessa starts PULLING OUT staples .
DEADPOOL: Oo . Ah . Quicker - like a Bandaid ! Owww- di 5000 . One last staple remains . Vanessa hesitates .
VANESSA: Sure I 'm sure .
DEADPOOL: I understand .
VANESSA: Kidding ! Get over yourself ! I 'd hit that shit .
DEADPOOL: You already did . Twice . Seriously ?
VANESSA: After a brief adjustment period and one or two drinks . It 's a face I 'd be happy to sit on .
DEADPOOL: I 'm also not the same under these pants . Super-penis .
DEADPOOL: I am ? ! Omigod . That . Was . Not . Mean ! Seriously , guys , it was a pleasure . Fo a second there , we felt like like five mini lion robots forming a large super robot .
VOLUNTEER: Can you make me better ?
DR. KILLEBREW: Better than better .
DEADPOOL: You 're still here ? It 's over ! Go home . Wait you expected a tease for Deadpool 2 ? ! Sorry , we 're low on dough . But if you can keep a secret , I can tell you who 's gon na be in it . Cable ! Someone suggested Mel Gibson for the role , buuuut- I was thinking Liam Neeson . Only problem , Liam likes to get paid . And more for Liam means less for me . Maybe we 'll crowdfund the shit . Just you and me , kids . Shalom !

COCO: In my second year of a four yea sentence . Wanted to go to New York .

HELMUT: Armstrong / Parker ? That you ooming assignment ?
COCO: Traditionally it 's where the hopelessly Afrocentric gather to process their guilt over not going to an HBCU . Where the Negros be at .
HELMUT: That 's not where you want to be ?
COCO: Bechet House is more my style .
HELMUT: With the rich white kids .
COCO: Excuse me ?
HELMUT: What part of Chicago you from ?
COCO: Hyde Park .
HELMUT: What street ?

COCO: So what 's this show about anyway ?
HELMUT: Here 's the way reality works sweetheart , I 'm the producer . I ask the questions . Be in touch .
HELMUT: This is the school radio ?

TROY: Head of House is always on duty .
COCO: Nice to meet you . I should get settled . Thanks Sof !
TROY: Think I got time for a quick cut ?
SOFIA: You got it cut last week .
TROY: It 's a Black thing babe .
SOFIA: Since when is OCD a Black thang ?
TROY: Do n't say `` thang '' like that .
SOFIA: Besides you 've got a shift at the Politicos booth , then a shift at Orientation , then your advisor
TROY: I 'll just wear a hat .
SOFIA: Then a movie maybe ? Just us ?
TROY: Election night . Babe , come on .
KURT: Sis .
TROY: Is she kidding with this ?
SOFIA: You do n't have to run again . Just ecause it 's her does n't mean
TROY: I ca n't let Sam and her wannabe Black Panthers take the House . The House needs me . This is who I am .
SOFIA: It 's who he wants you to be .
TROY: Oh so you pick up a Psych class you think you Freud or something ? Huh ?
SOFIA: A Freud reference . Sophisticated .
TROY: Fine Beck , Jung , Maslow
REGGIE: Yo Troy I forget . Is your major in shucking or was it jiving ?
TROY: My major 's in Jive . Minoring in Shuck . You 're still majoring in trying to fuck my left overs right ?
SOFIA: You need a shower .
TROY: You went from ODB to Trey Songz
REGGIE: That 's his platform ? Haircuts ?
SAM: Oofta is as Oofta does .
COCO: Boycotting hot combs do n't make you an expert on `` colored people '' boo .
TROY: No but seriously , I care about you guys . I care about this house . We had a great year last year and if it ai n't broke
REGGIE: Just pretend like you 're in the ooth . Just you and the mic .
SAM: Hate this shit . As Sam gets up and passes Troy
TROY: You really think you can take this from me ?
SAM: Troy we live in a world where there 's a Big Momma 's House 3 . I do n't have a chance in hell . Thank God .
TROY: Yo that 's enough of that Sam
SAM: then stand up for his own . Look , I know ya 'll ai n't voting for me . Ya 'll ai n't ready and I did n't come here for that . The Black Student Union and I have brought a petition to repeal the Randomization of Housing Act . I plan on bringing it to the President and together we can bring Black back to Manchester . It 'll be by the door .
MARTIN: I assume everyone has the app I created by now ?
REGGIE: It 's a child 's app
MARTIN: Good . Voting may commence .
COCO: So that 's what you 're looking for ?
HELMUT: I 'm looking for good TV sister .
COCO: I think I 'd be good TV .
HELMUT: You 're at a great school , getting a great education . Be good at that .
COCO: I am . And when I graduate early with an Economics degree from Manchester it will be the crowning achievement of my Black middle class parents ' ambitions .
HELMUT: Conflict is a commodity in my industry . Sam 's got it . Do you ?
COCO: So you want me to start a fight .
HELMUT: I do n't want you to do anything you would n't otherwise do .
SPEAKER: bigger the dick the less you 'll have to pay me to ssssuck it .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Most everything 's locked up , but we 'll find another residence to move you to . Third time 's a charm . What about Armstrong / Parker ?
LIONEL: I do n't know
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I might have an opening . Maybe it 'd e good to be aroundyou know .
LIONEL: Dean . The worst thing about high school , and believe me it was a long list , were the Black kids .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Maybe it 's in your head . Sure , sometimes our folks can be intolerant around people like you . Homo
LIONEL: I do n't believe in labels .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You like jazz Lionel ? Manchester 's like jazz you know .
LIONEL: This is a research school .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: And jazz is tension . The interplay of improvised solos all creating one song . Your problem is you 've got no instrument . No major , no affiliations , no solo son .
LIONEL: I submit articles to the Independent Observer .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: No one reads the Independent Observer , my point is are you playing swing or bebop ?
LIONEL: You 're mixing metaphors .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Are you a sax or are you a trumpet ?
LIONEL: I hate jazz . Fairbanks checks his watch . All out of ideas .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I 'll do what I can . Not a word of this in the Observer okay ?
LIONEL: What 's it matter ? No one reads it .
GEORGE: Lionel right ?
LIONEL: GroodGateI 'm ah..
GEORGE: Fan of your stuff . In the Observer ?
LIONEL: No one reads the Observer .
GEORGE: You seen this ?
LIONEL: What made you come over here ?
GEORGE: My staff ? God bless them . They 're whiter than Michael Jackson 's kids . We 're fucked if anyone of them writes this story and I will not let the transfers at the Gazette do it first .
LIONEL: The oldest one has his face .
GEORGE: You 're in the Black Student Union . You probably know Sam .
LIONEL: Trumpet
GEORGE: Bugle . Focus . The only paper on campus with a national subscription ase and an Advisor from the New York Times ? Only so many ways a person can distinguish themselves at a place like this Lionel . You 're good . You belong with us .
TROY: Get it yet ? Sam shakes her head yes .
SAM: Event requests for the year ?
TROY: Just this month . They need you approval . Also do n't forget to pick your office hours . At least 20 pe week .
SAM: That 's absurd .
TROY: You 're in charge of a hundred esidents now . And they need time to complain to your face . About noise . Leaky pipes . Gluten free options in the cafeteria . Etcetera .
SAM: Troy . I did n't think I was going to win .
TROY: And by the way petitioning the President on the Randomization of Housing Act is n't gon na do shit . None of the other houses are concerned .
SAM: Because they all have a legacy of ich and powerful allies on the oard who will make sure that `` random '' works out to thei advantage .
TROY: And you think a petition is going to change that ?
MARTIN: `` We wuz robbed . '' That election was suspect man .
SAM: You call me the minute there 's an update . Love you too mom .
CURLS: There is one other sister in my Relativity class , I 'll be damned if our professor does n't call me Laretta every God damn time .
DREADS: We all look the same .
REGGIE: Programming professor gets me and Martin here mixed up constantly .
MARTIN: You should be so lucky . Reggie glances over at Martin 's Mac Air .
REGGIE: Cute . You get that at Toys R Us ?
SAM: I always forget passwords .
REGGIE: You are begging to get hacked .
SAM: Good thing the one evil techno- genius thinking like that is on my side .
REGGIE: Winning was a happy accident . We want the reform repealed right ?
CURLS: Means to an end , sister .
COCO: The talented tenth always has to ust its ass a little bit harder , ut I do n't see the benefit in laming white folks for everything .
CURLS: Who 's blaming ?
TROY: I do n't see the issue . I never had one . Never ran into any lynch mobs . Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action .
SAM: Lynch mob is still there . Just re- anded itself .
TROY: As what pray tell ?
REGGIE: The Republican party .
SAM: Want to know how this world sees you ? Go to a Young Republican 's meeting and bring up Welfare .
SUNGMI: Or Immigration .
LIONEL: Or gay equality .
KURT: Bullshit .
MARTIN: I agree . Got something to add ?
KURT: The biggest athletes , movie stars , hell your president is Black .
SUNGMI: You 're not serious .
KURT: You guys still got affirmative action , you 're set .
REGGIE: This shit .
SAM: What are you doing in here ?
KURT: Obama . Leader of the free world got into Harvard on affirmative action . Know who 's not president right now ? The guy that did n't get in .
SAM: On behalf of the colored folks in the room , let me apologize for all the better qualified white students whose place we 're taking up .
KURT: Yeah but what other dining hall gives you chicken and waffles ? Dea White People right ? Funny stuff . How have n't we staffed you yet ?
SAM: On Pastiche ? Your uninspired humo magazine ?
KURT: We 're a lot more than a magazine sweetie . SNL staff is basically half Lampoon , half Pastiche . Just like the network comedies . A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco .
SAM: What gives you Clubhouse kids the ight to come to our Dining Hall ?
MARTIN: Sam ? What are you doing ?
SAM: You ca n't eat here .
TROY: Chill Sam damn . Let the man
KURT: Who are you to put me out ?
SAM: I 'm the Head of this house . And I 'm doing things my way .
KURT: You got any idea who you 're
SAM: Yeah , I know who your daddy is . The same one who 's been pushing to eak up this House for a decade . What 's wrong ? Is he scared letting the Negroes gather in groups might start a rebellion on the plantation ? You tell him from mehe should be .
KURT: Bad move .
SAM: You too .
LIONEL: Me ?
SAM: Is this your house ?
COCO: The fuck ?
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Okay . Does anyone have any comments for Sam 's `` Rebirth of a Nation ? ''
GABE: I dig the `` silent movie '' thing , but it 's a little self-congratulatory . Light on story and frankly thematically dubious .
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Okay . Anybody else ?
SAM: What ?
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Sam ?
SAM: Before you say anything might I emind you that I sat through Birth of A Nation , Gone With The Wind , and Tarantino week without protest .
PROFESSOR BODKIN: And might I remind you that I read all fifteen pages of you unsolicited essay on why Gremlins is actually about suburban white fear of Black culture .
SAM: The Gremlins are loud , talk in slang , are addicted to fried chicken and freak out when you get their hair wet .
PRESIDENT BODKIN: My only problem with your movie is that it was late . The silent projects were last semester Sam . You were supposed to have emailed your sound treatment over Summer .
SAM: I 've been getting footage .
PROFESSOR BODKIN: This is your senior thesis Sam , where the hell is your head at ?
SAM: I 've got Radio , BSU , this Head of House thing
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Do you want this ? Cause if not , do n't waste my time here
SAM: Look this thing might as well be my right hand Professor . I was busy this summer that 's all .
PROFESSOR BODKIN: With everything but your major ? While your peers are taking internships , making short films
SAM: My dad . He 's sick . Had to go home .
PROFESSOR BODKIN: If you need some time off , take it . But if you want to make it to next semester
SAM: I do
PROFESSOR BODKIN: Pull it together . This is Manchester .
SAM: Thematically dubious ?
GABE: Well what was that supposed to be about exactly ?
SAM: You 're thematically dubious ! Gabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her .
GABE: You invoke Minstrelsy for shock value , but to what end ?
SAM: To invoke the same feeling I get when I turn on the TV and see some so-called reality star shuck and jive for ratings egged on by no doubt white producers . Or the sassy Black secretary with no backstory or character development aside from their skin color .
GABE: So it 's a tit for tat ? *
SAM: You 're honestly saying that art * ca n't be reactionary ? *
GABE: You 're reacting to a work made * almost a hundred years ago . *
SAM: Yes because fear of Black men being * involved in the United States * Government is a completely * antiquated concept . No social * elevance whatsoever today . *
GABE: Frankly I just think sometimes its * etter to hold a mirror up to your * audience than to drop an * ideological piano over their head . *
SAM: Blackface is alive and well in ou culture . Who primarily buys hip hop ? Watches Housewives of Atlanta ? The same homogenized images of Black people over and over again ? White people Gabe .
GABE: Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies ?
SAM: We 're an underfed community . None of this changes the fact that the vibrancy , the complexity of Black culture has been distilled into commodities and marketing schemes to be bought and sold
GABE: to the detriment of the so called `` real thing . '' Got it . And into a room
SAM: I am indistinguishable from the so called `` urban '' images used to amuse and market to white America .
GABE: And the commodification of culture is uniquely oppressive to Black people ?
SAM: On your knees .
GABE: What ? You dream in `` Cosby '' again ?
SAM: My hair was so straight . My sweate so big . I told you about that ?
GABE: Hey sothis whole `` Head of House '' thing . Congrats ?
SAM: Yeah , it'sit 's .
GABE: Weird , right ? Never took you as a student politician
SAM: Yeah , well
GABE: Sam ? What are we doing ?
SAM: Fucking .
GORDON: Kurt it 's three .
MITCH: Y.O.L.O . my nigga ! Everyone takes the shot .
GORDON: We do n't even have our new staff yet . Why are we planning this ?
KURT: Everyone wants to be on our staff that 's the easy part .
MITCH: We 're going to make staff bids on Game Night , and the RSVP 's are through the roof for that .
KURT: Yeah but Halloween is our premiere party . The waitlist is already a hundred deep and it 's going to take a lot to outdo this summer .
MITCH: Cinco de Mayo was epic .
GORDON: How about the Young Republicans ?
KURT: Too close to the Tea-Party .
MITCH: Yo we need an East vs West hip hop party . Get the honeys in here .
GORDON: `` The honeys ? '' You 're from Vermont .
KURT: Guys what 's the Pastiche motto ?
GORDON: `` Sharpen thy sword . ''
MITCH: Our motto is a euphemism fo masturbation ?
GORDON: It 's a reminder that satire is the weapon of reason . So who on campus is being unreasonable ?
MITCH: Sounds like a reminder of how gay you are .
GORDON: Was that even a reasonable attempt at a quip Mitch ?
MITCH: Hey Gordon , say reasonable again .
KURT: The hell does Sam think she is ?
MITCH: Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a pissed off baby .
KURT: Could we ?
GORDON: How ?
KURT: Hey Lionel . Talked to the Dean today .
GORDON: Please put that away .
KURT: You got to talk to these people in a language they 'll understand .
LIONEL: Pathetic .
KURT: Wherever he ships you off to , be sure to pack a sense of humor with you , kay bro ?
SAM: The Tip Test . You hit up Jelly 's for a snack . Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you who once ran up a thirty dollar bill and left a dollar tip .
LIONEL: Pastrami sandwich on rye .
SAM: then proceed to wait no less than forty minutes for your food .
LIONEL: Forty minutes ? Man she 's lucky I leave her forty cents . You do a good job , maybe you 'll see a tip .
LIONEL: Doris was tripping , but fifteen percent is the least I can do .
SAM: Or C
LIONEL: I reject the stereotype that African American 's do n't tip . I 'm leaving her twenty , no twenty five , just to prove I can !
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Free speech my ass .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Stalin quotes for two hundred ?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: You 're joking about this ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I 'm sorry , was I supposed to take `` Free speech my ass '' as a legitimate suggestion ?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: This is your office 's issue Walter . Especially after that episode with Kurt in the dining hall .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Every race issue is my issue .
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: It 's a student issue . You are the Dean of students are n't you ? The two share an old and heated glare .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: How bad is this deficit of yours ?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Worse . But let me tell you something . If this blows up any further ? It 's on you Walter . Racism is over in America . And if anyone 's still dealing with it , it 's the I do n't know Mexicans probably .
TROY: President Fletcher .
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Son , call me Herb .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: President Fletcher tells me his son got his ass handed to him . Troy hates this game .
TROY: Sam 's out of line . Kurt 's alright .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: But you 're supposed to be bette than alright . Since when do we lose elections Troy ?
TROY: The Housing Act passing without a fight did n't help .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: What have I told you about excuses ?
TROY: Pops my course load is full anyway . I 'm head of Econ Board , I 'm thinking about Pastiche .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Pastiche ? On Kurt Fletcher 's staff ?
TROY: You know to round out the res ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I 'll be God damned if twenty years from now you have to end up working for that dumb asses son .
TROY: Yes sir .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Fletcher and I graduated a yea apart . He barely made it through . I graduated Summa cum Laude . Now look who 's President and who 's Dean .
TROY: What 's the difference ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: A couple hundred grand a year . Understand what I 'm saying ? Now what happened between you and Sam to make her come after you anyway ?
TROY: Sofia . You remember Sofia ? Daughte of the President . Psych major . `` Has the world ahead of her Troy . ''
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I do n't like your tone boy .
TROY: Sorry sir .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: So you lost the House . On to the school presidency then . The light in Troy 's eyes dims a bit .
TROY: Someone like me ?
TROY: Babe . Hat or no hat ?
SOFIA: I do n't have to be .
TROY: What 's with all this boo stuff ?
SOFIA: since you fucked me with you ig Black cock . Troy pulls away .
TROY: I love you .
SOFIA: Is it Sam ?
TROY: Can we please just , get ready ?
SOFIA: Why ? I hate my brother 's friends . Troy thinks over his next words carefully .
TROY: You 're not going to go with me ?
SOFIA: You 'd go without me ? Troy tries to flash a charming shrug .
TROY: You can hang out while I 'm
SOFIA: Okay , what 's with you and my other ? Are you in love with him ? Is this like , some DL shit ? Sofia storms out .
TROY: `` DL shit ! ? ''
GEORGE: I keeps it clean Ya know what I mean . I drinks my Vodka straight , like I 'm a fiend .
ANNIE: Wait , quiet I want to hear this . Annie turns up a Youtube video of
LIONEL: Relax the Negro at the door is not here to rape you . Annie laughs . The mood is drunk and light .
GEORGE: We 're taking a break , what are you doing here ?
LIONEL: You wanted me to drop in and tell you how the story was coming ?
GEORGE: Yeah like this week . It 's Saturday night . You got nowhere else to be ?
LIONEL: It was this or the new Madea movie .
GEORGE: Dear God . Where does Madea go this time ? Dialysis ?
REGGIE: Man fuck Tyler Perry .
SAM: Like , can we have a movie with , you know characters in them ? ` Stead of stereotypes wrapped in Christian dogma ?
REGGIE: Why is every educated person inherently evil ? Why this Nigga got ta be in a mutha fucking dress all the mutha fucking time ?
SAM: How come the only Black movies Hollywood wants to make are ones with mammies in fat suits or Black women in pain man ?
TEENAGER: Most people are here to see Fang 9 . Kelly Rowland 's in it ?
SAM: How ` bout you stop stereotyping yourself and put that shit out ? This ai n't `` Friday . ''
REGGIE: Yo Sam . We got to talk about the protest . When are we are bringing the Housing fight to the prez ?
SUNGMI: The House voted down sponsoring the ally .
REGGIE: What do we need it sponsored for ?
SAM: Demonstrations can get shut down if a House does n't sponsor them .
REGGIE: Like the House you 're head of ? Sam shoots Reggie a glare . He backs off .
SUNGMI: Hey Sam , I read `` Ebony and Ivy . '' What 's with the Oofta , Nose-Jobs , One Hundred stuff ? I miss something ? Sam smiles .
SAM: You want me to break it down ?
MITCH: Yo my perfect Friday night is whiskey and my T-Bone Walke ecords , real talk .
TROY: Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker ?
SAM: Only a few ways colored folks survive at a place like this .
MITCH: Uh only a pioneer of electric and jump blues bro . Know your roots .
TROY: White folks always be on stuff like decades too late and act like they discovered some shit .
SAM: `` Oofta '' is the jazz age term fo Bojangle types who Blacked it up for White audiences .
MITCH: Do n't sleep on T-Bone man .
TROY: Rock , Jazz , Blues - Nigga whatchu got on right now ?
MITCH: Public Enemy my Nig

TROY: Whatchu mean all your girls ?
GORDON: Dude , between OJ , Tiger , Wesley Snipes and uh , Troy over here
TROY: Yo . It 's a word for that . Reparations . More Kurt-less laughter from the table .
SAM: An Oofta modulates his Blackness up or down depending on the crowd and what he wants from them .
MITCH: Kurt ?
KURT: What ?
GORDON: Kurt . Troy watches this exchange closely .
TROY: That 's the magazine right ?
GORDON: For starters .
MITCH: What other `` magazine '' you know has a first look deal at NBC ? The third iggest Youtube channel . Talk show . Platinum comedy record homie !
GORDON: Could n't you see him on the talk show Kurt ? Kurt looks at his cards .
KURT: I fold .
SUNGMI: Okay , and a nose-job is a wannabe ?
SAM: Sort of . Nose-jobs smooth thei Black edges and try to blend .
GORDON: You seen this one ?
COCO: Ugh .
GORDON: Not a fan ? Coco makes a `` no '' face .
MITCH: Sup ma ?
COCO: Do n't talk like that .
GORDON: Hey I know you
SAM: A Nose-job 's worst fear is that their `` Blackness '' might cause a fuss or draw undue attention so they apologize for it or use it to self deprecate .
COCO: Forty thousand views already ?
GORDON: Looks like someone submitted you to Buzzfeed . Taking off
MITCH: You wan ' a drink a sun'in ?
COCO: Let me guess you 're from Ohio ?
MITCH: Vermont .
GORDON: What do you have against Dear White People ?
SUNGMI: Okay and One Hundred ?
REGGIE: Keeping it One-Hundred ! Being Black as hell just cause . Sam rolls her eyes .
SUNGMI: But what about just being you ?
SAM: Like I said
ANNIE: You do n't mind do you ?
LIONEL: Of course not .
GEORGE: Alright so then what ?
LIONEL: So then Sam says `` What , is you daddy scared the Negroes are gon na start a rebellion on the plantation ? '' George goes CRAZY at this .
GEORGE: To Kurt Fletcher ! ?
LIONEL: Yeah . Yes . Yup .
GEORGE: We 've got a news item but there 's something bigger here . It 's a profile piece on Armstrong / Parke and Sam White 's pseudo revolution .
ANNIE: What 's the headline ?
LIONEL: Outdated nationalist seeks purpose starts race war ?
GEORGE: Beers in the corner . Bang out the news item tonight and we 'll work on the profile piece for next week .
LIONEL: What are you doing ?
ANNIE: All Bugle staffer must freestyle . It 's law .
GEORGE: You want to be a staffer right ?
LIONEL: My name is Lionel Kind of like a lion King of the jungle Indigenous to Africa The beat has long since stopped .
TROY: Yo man , you know I was n't talking about Sof back there with whole forty bitches thing . I was just
KURT: trying to get on my staff ?
TROY: I never really thought about
KURT: Bullshit . Game Night is where we make our bids for the new staff . It 's why everyone 's here . You were practically about to bust out a tap dance .
TROY: I 'm a Poly Sci major man . I just came to hang out .
KURT: My staff likes you . A lot .
TROY: But you do n't .
KURT: This thing with you and Sof
TROY: I 'm good to her .
KURT: Our dad 's have been playing a game of chess off and on since 1972 .
TROY: What and Sof is the White queen ?
KURT: You 're a pawn . And I think it 's time you get off the board bro . Troy takes this in .
COCO: I just think having good hair and carrying on with a degree of sophistication does n't make me a traitor to the race .
MITCH: Want to know why they used to call me Black Mitch ?
TROY: Okay . And what 's this year 's theme ? Kurt rolls his eyes instinctively .
KURT: Still working on that
TROY: The party 's a couple weeks away .
GORDON: Yo Kurt . I want you to meet someone .
COCO: You guys got a party coming up ?
SUNGMI: Hey , about the rally . You could still get the permit anyway Sam and go against the board . Most people consider that political suicide though .
REGGIE: We got to rally Sam . Time is now .
SAM: Use your head Reggie . You think a ally is going to change things ?
REGGIE: It 'll do a hell of a lot more than a radio show or views on Youtube .
SAM: We ? I did n't see you running fo shit Reggie .
REGGIE: Tired .
SAM: Do n't `` one word '' me .
REGGIE: Why you got to snap at me all the time ? I 'm around you like twenty four seven . Like your lap dog . I do n't even usually get down like that with no red bone chicks man .
SAM: Do n't call me that .
REGGIE: Come on , I thought your ass was Puerto Rican when I met you . Sam turns to go .
SAM: I 'm taking my ass home .
REGGIE: Come on Sam . You know how I feel about you .
SAM: How am I supposed to know how you feel about me ?
REGGIE: You know what ? Forgive me if I see something in you . Something inspiring . Something folks like me can get behind .
SAM: I 'll set up the rally .
GORDON: Are we sure about this ?
KURT: It 's ironic . Bold . And do n't tell me I 'm the only one who thinks Sam White 's little movement needs to get cut down to size .
MITCH: ` Bout time . It 's going to be huge man , fucking epic . Kurt holds back a smile .
KURT: Boys , we 've got a lot more mingling to do . We 'll be in touch . And Troy ? Get off the board bro .
TROY: Nice seeing you .
COCO: Where 's Sofia ?
TROY: I have no idea .
COCO: Trouble in paradise ? Troy shrugs and heads to the party .
TROY: What 's that supposed to mean ?
COCO: It 's fine . I 'm not even really into Black dudes anyway .
TROY: I 'll have you know I 'm an equal opportunity employer , okay ?
COCO: And what kind of jobs are you hiring for mister ? Coco 's stiletto rubs the side of Troy 's calf .
TROY: Are n't you and Sofia
COCO: I 'm an accessory to Sofia . Ca n't ever shake the feeling I 'm an assignment for that Afro Studies Minor of hers .
LIONEL: She seems really cool . George just smiles .
GEORGE: Did we go too far ? You 're in Armstrong/Parker right ?
LIONEL: No . Garmin .
GEORGE: Fancy .
LIONEL: George I 'm not exactly down with Sam and I 'm not in the BSU . I got kicked out of Armstrong / Parke same as Kurt . But I 'm going to write a good story , okay ?
GEORGE: I hope so . I want a Bugle on you chest by the end of the month .
LIONEL: I 'm growing it out .
GEORGE: Night Lionel .
MITCH: Party 's not over .
LIONEL: I live here .
MITCH: Sorry bro . Invitation only .
LIONEL: It 's two in the morning .
TROY: Coco huh ?
COCO: Colandrea does n't exactly pass the esume test , you know ? I mean could n't you fucking die ? My parents should 've just named me Ghetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha . Do youindulge ?
TROY: It 's ten am .
COCO: Sure about that ?
TROY: Sure you do n't like Black guys ?
COCO: Girl like me is just a placeholde for ya 'll at a place like this .
TROY: I 'm not like that .
COCO: I do n't think Sam would agree .
TROY: That was different .
COCO: No it was n't . Poor thing , she was light skin-ded and everything .
TROY: Yo , it was n't like that alright ?
COCO: So your upbringing may have actually fucked you up more than mine ? That 's hot . Troy laughs and takes the joint back .
TROY: Apparently four hundred years of unreconciled oppression .
COCO: He 's not going to like you running with the Pastiche boys is he ?
TROY: If I even get tapped .
COCO: You will . And you should do it . They all land somewhere big , some efore they even graduate . I 've seen you in front of a crowd Troy . I bet you could be famous .
TROY: That what you want ? To be famous ?
COCO: I want people to know my name .
TROY: Which one ?
COCO: We want you . Come by Ellington tomorrow at eight . Anything ?
SOFIA: You said you loved me .
TROY: I like you a lot .
SOFIA: What do you do in the bathroom ? When you leave the shower running ? Was it just to get away from me ?
TROY: I smoke weed and write jokes .
LIONEL: The Dean said it was the only opening .
TROY: Head of House does n't share .
LIONEL: But you 're not Head of House .
DREADS: Stay Black , my brother .
LIONEL: Sure thing ?
KURT: Need your submission by Thursday .
TROY: You got it bro .
KURT: The fuck ?
TROY: Yo !
REGGIE: Finally made it in .
DREADS: Been moved around a lot right ?
CURLS: You must have been terrified when you saw `` Armstrong/Parker '' written on your moving assignment .
LIONEL: I was just finishing up .
REGGIE: Do Black people scare you ?
LIONEL: No .
REGGIE: You 're too scared to even ask anyone for a cut .
LIONEL: I 'm growing it out .
DREADS: No . I 'm growing it out . You 're fostering an ecosystem .
REGGIE: How come you do n't come to BSU ?
LIONEL: I listen to Mumford and Sons and watch Robert Altman movies . You honestly think I 'm Black enough fo the union ?
DREADS: Yo , I love Robert Altman . Mutha fucka goes in .
CURLS: We 're not all homophobes you know . Black folks ? Lionel 's eyes dart around . How did she know ?
DREADS: I 'm bumping Frank Ocean right now . I do n't give a fuck . Imma still eat at Chik Fil A though . Them nuggets good as hell .
LIONEL: I 'm late for class .
REGGIE: You 're the `` Black voice '' of the Bugle now . We 're just trying to decide if you are friend or foe .
LIONEL: I 'm not on staff . Not until I make good on my assignment , I 'm just
REGGIE: Assignment ? What 's the story ?
LIONEL: They want me to do a profile piece on Black culture at Manchester .
REGGIE: Of which you are so clearly an expert . Shame floods Lionel 's face .
LIONEL: Being neither .
GABE: Sam ! Really Sam ? She just looks away . Reggie eyes him coolly .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Running late . Sam pauses and turns to see him .
SAM: Forget your sign Dean ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Do you honestly think this is in the spirit of Armstrong / Parke house ?
SAM: The role of the counter culture is to wake up the mainstream to
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I 've got furniture older than you . Counter culture ? Is that what you think this is ? That show of yours ?
SAM: What about my show ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Your show is racist .
SAM: Black people ca n't be racist .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Do you read the school papers ?
SAM: Is the New York Times a school paper ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Your antics are making press Sam and press like this keeps men like President Fletcher up at night .
SAM: Warm milk ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: He 's building a file on you .
SAM: It 's not my fault your son could n't eat me in an election .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I 'm sure it was hard growing up . Wondering which side you fit into . Feeling like you have to overcompensate perhaps ?
SAM: If that 's true , I 'm not the only one Dean .
REGGIE: There you are ! We supposed to start at noon .
SAM: I told you I had class .
REGGIE: Those are going up on Gillespie . Good right ?
SAM: No . I mean how long do I have to talk anyway ?
REGGIE: You 're kidding right ? You 're sort of the keynote .
SAM: Yeah butyou know I think the whole Malcolm X thing is your lane Reg . I 'm just not
REGGIE: They came to hear you Sam . Gra a bullhorn . Turn it on .
GABE: What is all this ?
SAM: Hey . In the middle of Okay . Okay . Okay .
REGGIE: Sam ?
GABE: You want me to tell them to go ?
SAM: You 're so tough .
GABE: I will .
SAM: I want you to wait until they 've gone and then head home .
GABE: I 'm trying to be here for you .
SAM: Can you be somewhere else for me ?
REGGIE: Sam ! I know you 're home .
GABE: What do you see in him ?
SAM: The only eligible single brother on campus .
GABE: Wow . Okay .
SAM: I get it . Your parents owned in Harlem or something ? You watched `` Do The Right Thing '' in high school and you want to prove to the world you 're down ?
GABE: I want to be down ? How long does it take to get your hair like that ?
SAM: Reggie I will call you later damn ! You do n't know what you 're talking about . Girls like me
GABE: what ? Have to pick a side ? I 'm sick of your tragic Mulatto ullshit Sam !
SAM: You ca n't say Mulatto .
GABE: Mulatto ! Mulatto ! Mulatto !
SAM: Window . Go out the window .
GABE: I 'm sorry if I ca n't be your Nubian prince on my Black horse ready to take you back to fucking Zamunda !
SAM: That 's not a real African country .
GABE: Can I please get some credit for a solid `` Coming to America '' eference ? Sam tries not laugh at this .
SAM: No ? And who am I ?
GABE: You 're thisgirl
SAM: Perceptive .
GABE: Wholikes to argue with me about every fucking thing . And I hate it ecause we both know you 're smarte than me . Your favorite director is Bergman , but you tell people its Spike Lee . You love bebop , but you 've got a thing for Taylo Swift . I know because my Mac picks up your Mac 's library .
SAM: And I was so careful
GABE: You like to use phrases from the thirties and wear clothes from the fifties and hairstyles from the sixties . You like to watch me when you think I 'm sleeping . And trace the outlines of my face .
SAM: Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah . It 's okay . Get some sleep .
GABE: Everything okay ?
SAM: His condition 's stable .
GABE: Good . That 's good Sam . Gabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again .
SAM: Gabe !
GABE: What ! ?
SAM: I 'm sorry .
HELMUT: New videos are picking up steam .
COCO: Told you I was good TV .
HELMUT: The show I 'm scouting for It 's called Black Face / White Place . It 's reality . Like a `` True Life . '' Each episode centers on a different one of `` us '' in a sea of `` them . ''
COCO: Interesting .
HELMUT: Interesting ? You think they want interesting ? Dignified stories of triumph and survival ? They want the `` authentic urban experience '' which is basically network talk for bitching and weave snatching . I 'm telling you this ecause the network is looking to take one of the subjects to series . I got one episode . One shot to find that subject . So if we do this
COCO: we do it all the way . I 'm guessing Sam turned you down .
HELMUT: I think so . She called me a Bojangling Oofta , whatever that means . Everything else she said would 've been bleeped on tv . So look , forty thousand hits on Youtube is good . It 's not great .
COCO: I 'm about to get a whole lot more .
KURT: We do n't have anyone like you on staff and you had a great idea . We ought you here to
COCO: I want to MC it . Your party .
KURT: We 're here to tell you what we want .
COCO: You want me and in order to get me , you have to let me MC .
HELMUT: They 'd let you do that ?
COCO: They got no choice . They need me
KURT: We do n't let people video blog ou events
COCO: You got a week to put this thing together boo boo . What 's it going to be ?
HELMUT: It 's just
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Martin , would you share with Troy what you shared with me ?
MARTIN: The server that processes the voting results for House Elections has shut down the A.P . database . Saw it this morning . Apparently the intermediary program is on a efractile loop .
TROY: I 'm a Poly Sci major man .
MARTIN: Sam currently has 445 votes . That 's 200 more than she had last week during the actual election .
TROY: There 's not even that many esidents in Armstrong / Parker .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: She cheated . Hacked the system .
SAM: I would n't even begin to know how to do something like that .
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Is your little war really this important ?
MARTIN: Had to have been Reggie . Dude 's in my programing class . Good . Just forgot to turn his program off .
TROY: Wow .
MARTIN: You 're the rightful Head of House .
TROY: So great .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Martin , let me talk to Troy for a it . I appreciate this .
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: Your advisor tells me you 're hanging on by a thread in you major . Perhaps it 's time to eprioritize .
SAM: You 're trying to frighten me , but I think you 're the one who 's scared .
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: And I think you long for the days where Blacks were hanging from trees and denied actual rights . Then you 'd actually have something to fight against . A swell of emotion behind Sam 's steel eyes .
SAM: You damn right it is .
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: We do n't have an intolerance problem here . Except for the one I 'm looking at .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You did n't tell me you and Sofia had a misunderstanding .
TROY: Who did ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Her father . She was very upset . Troy . What sort of vision do you have for yourself ?
TROY: Get my degree . Then Law School and then
DEAN FAIRBANKS: And what 's that got to do with partying with Kurt ? With smoking weed and writing jokes ? Panic flashes over Troy .
TROY: Dad no . I want what we always talked about . Maybe have my own firm someday ? Run for office . Make a difference . Wife . Kids . I want all that . I really really do .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: And the drugs ? God damn it Troy I taught you better than this . I have een in academia a long time , I 've seen a lot of things . The men who eally run this world ? You got no idea what they see when they see you . You are not going to be what they all think you are . You will not give them that satisfaction , you hear me ?
TROY: Yes sir .
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: I know about the party . You picked a hell of a time .
KURT: What party
PRESIDENT FLETCHER: You 're cancelling Kurt . End of story .
ANNIE: Well ?
GEORGE: That was our Times advisor . He said it 's stories like these that get editors recommendation letters .
LIONEL: The Negro at the door did n't scare you this time . Annie smiles and heads for the door .
ANNIE: Lionel please . You 're only technically Black . G , going to French . You want me to hold you seat ?
GEORGE: Thanks . Annie smiles and walks out .
LIONEL: You need something ? Saw your e- mail .
GEORGE: Yeah , I need someone to do the Donor 's function on Saturday . Small dinner for the school 's big givers . Administration wants a little coverage .
LIONEL: That 's Halloween night .
GEORGE: Right , which is why no one else will take it .
LIONEL: Ah . Thus the new guy .
GEORGE: On my way to class , but you can stay and check out last year 's piece . You 'll do fine .
LIONEL: I do n't know . Are there going to be any racially fueled outbursts at this thing ?
GEORGE: Never know right ?
LIONEL: Am I a good writer ?
GEORGE: You 'll get better . And we need you ight now .
LIONEL: You 're just a big recommendation away from landing the Times .
GEORGE: God I hope so .
LIONEL: Yeah . Sounds good . George heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed .
LIONEL: Funny seeing you here .
TROY: Father likes to show me off at all the Donor functions . The dessert course is usually my cue to take a eather while they talk shop . The trick is to dazzle them into forking over their estates just efore they kick the bucket .
LIONEL: SoPicard or Kirk ?
TROY: Kirk . Wait
LIONEL: I saw you watching Star
TROY: Yo what happens in the cri stays in the crib . Not trying to get my card revoked .
LIONEL: Hey , some could argue that a show with Whoopi Goldberg , Michael Dorn and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty Black show .
TROY: Yeah ? That work out for you ?
LIONEL: No . No it did not . At least not in High School . I bet there 's a statue of you at your High School .
TROY: I was beloved . Wo n't lie .
LIONEL: Did they know you were a trekker ?
TROY: My pops left a paint by numbers template for success at that High School . All I had to do was fill in the blanks . Football captain . Valedictorian . Prom King . Lionel sees a sadness in Troy .
LIONEL: I think it 's gaining sentience .
TROY: It'sout there .
LIONEL: It 's like a black hole for white people 's fingers . They 're obsessed .
TROY: You know I cut hair . Why did n't you ask me ?
LIONEL: You 're I dunnoyou ?
GEORGE: Li ! You ready man ?
LIONEL: No costumes ? I got a tux for this .
ANNIE: We just got out of the staff room .
GEORGE: Yeah , we 're going as overworked .
LIONEL: Where is it ?
ANNIE: Garmin House . On third I think ?
LIONEL: Third and Basin . I know it . Before Lionel jets to join them .
TROY: Yo man . If I 'd gone to your High School , I 'd have had your back .
LIONEL: This is kind of fucked up . Right ?
GEORGE: Pastiche . The world 's most erudite oneheads . Who wants another round ? Come on Lionel , help a brother out .
LIONEL: Kitchen 's this way .
COCO: Hey there muffins . How do I look ? Why are white folks so obsessed with being Black ? And why are Black folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie doll weaves ? Honeys it 's a strange symbiosis we 're here to explore
LIONEL: Ouch .
GEORGE: Sorry .
LIONEL: It 's okay . Ca n't wait to cut all this off .
GEORGE: Do n't you dare .
LIONEL: I 'll be right back .
KURT: What the hell ?
SAM: For a genius dude you 're a fucking idiot .
REGGIE: I did it , we did it for you .
SAM: I did n't ask for it Reggie . I look like I betrayed this house .
REGGIE: Yeah ? Well you betrayed me .
LIONEL: Sam ? Can we talk ? Sam turns back around fiercely .
ANNIE: Hey who am I ? `` Bitch it 's weave . Noun . Present tense ho ! ''
KURT: Yeah ?
COCO: Kurt , it 's me . I ca n't do this .
KURT: Okay , I 'm fucking confused .
SAM: What do you want me to do ? Go ove there and yell at them ?
LIONEL: Have you heard you yelling ?
SAM: This house is filled with folks willing to take up after a cause Lionel . Believe me . Never would have guessed you 'd be one of them ut
LIONEL: For the first time in my life , I ca n't just sit around and do nothing . How can you ?
SAM: If I 'm caught being a part of anything like thisit would n't be good for me right now okay ? Lionel gets up and walks towards the door .
LIONEL: Hey . How 's it going . Hi .
SUNGMI: Black Student Union . Lionel smiles shyly . He should 've known that .
DREADS: Your call then man .
REGGIE: Alright ya 'll - thanks for coming out tonight . Looks like Sam 's not making it solet 's just call it .
LIONEL: Uh . Excuse me . Hi . I 'm Lionel . Some of younone of you probably know me . I 've never been to a meeting . But I just came back from a party on campus and I think you should know about it .
REGGIE: Alright brother . What 's the plan ?
LIONEL: We go over there . Now .
CURLS: Think there 's enough of us ?
SUNGMI: You know you do n't have a monopoly on being a pissed off minority . Latino 's United is meeting across the hall . Asian American League too . You guys got better snacks .
TROY: Dad
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Not now Troy .
TROY: It 's important . There 's something happening on campus . I might 've
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You 're being rude son .
TROY: Oh am I ? How about I tell you precious donors and anyone here who 'll listen about the kind of a school it is they 're giving to ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: I do n't know who you think you are young man but you do n't get to talk to your father any kind of way .
TROY: All I say to you is yes sir and no sir ! Look I should 've brought this up before but listen to me !
KURT: What ?
GORDON: Yeah dude . We all got it . I mean , everything 's cool right ? A noise in the other room startles them
KURT: Lionel ?
LIONEL: We 're putting an end to this Kurt .
KURT: Fuck you I 'm calling the cops .
MARTIN: Half of this crowd is under 21 .
MITCH: Gim me that mic Before I slap ya Looking for some dykes , that wan na another chapta . If you do me slow , you can do me faster , I 'll pass you to the Nigga on my ight , he gets you after .
LIONEL: Kurt
KURT: Why do n't you tuck your tail etween your legs , run and tell the Dean and get the fuck out .
LIONEL: Heyyyy ! Hoooo ! Heyyy ! Hooo !
COCO: What ? Say it . Come on . Sam stays silent .
KURT: Dude . I know you ca n't help it
LIONEL: Finally got me where you want me .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: What is all this ?
KURT: I did n't do this . Sam . I had nothing to do with this .
ANCHOR: What some are calling a `` race war '' has erupted at one of the nation 's oldest and most prestigious
DEAN FAIRBANKS: We do n't condone this egregious event and are investigating its origins . The president and I are looking at ways to address issues of Diversity at Manchester .
REGGIE: HOUSING REFORM !
MITCH: I 'm sorry but it 's bullshit . Yo this is how we get down . If you ca n't take a joke in this day and age ? The fact we can joke about it proves we 've moved on you feel me ? This is an attack on free speech ! We 're the victims here !
LIONEL: It 's hard enough for us to even get into a school like this . Let alone succeed . Find our way . This is only a debate because of who Kurt 's dad is , which just proves the point . All you did was have a radio show and look what happened to you .
COCO: I know this may come as a shock , ut nobody gives a fuck about no Harriet muthafuckin Tubmanthey wan na be us . So they got to be fo a night .
TROY: Of course I got my dad involved . It was the right thing to do . I did n't mean for all this to happen . All the posters and everything .
SAM: Dear White People
KURT: Once I heard what the group was planning , I sent out an email to the staff to cancel it . You have the email printed in front of you .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Who 's this ? Kurt turns to a SUITED MAN next to him .
KURT: My lawyer .
COCO: So when I got the invite and saw everyone clicking `` yes '' I figured it was back on .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You were hoping to make the staff ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: At what point in time did you show up to the event ?
SAM: Why am I even here ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: We know you were planning this .
KURT: Your son tell you that ?
DEAN FAIRBANKS: `` wishing you could sip on Henny out yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving you the side-eye ? '' You write this Troy ? Troy looks up at his father embarrassed .
TROY: No . Mine was n't chosen .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: But you wanted to be ?
TROY: What I wanted did n't matter then . Why should it matter now ? I told you about the party , remember ?
KURT: I loathe Facebook .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: You 've used that line on me before this year Mr. Fletcher . When a homophobic message mysteriously appeared on a voice mail line you shared with a roommate .
LIONEL: To stop it .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: By any means necessary ?
LIONEL: Someone once told meMancheste is like jazz . I do n't know much about jazz . But from what I can tell , when your solo 's up , you etter blow . Fairbanks fights a smile .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Well what 's interesting is how easy it was to access the group before the note was sent . The password was `` Pa $ tiche '' spelled with a dolla sign according to Kurt . Seems ecently it 's been changed .
SAM: As much as you hate him , you will stop at nothing to protect you master and his boy .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Did you send out the invite Sam ?
SAM: That invite , whoever sent it should 've been met with derision and outrage . Instead , a hundred people showed up and they pulled out posters and decorations and costumes they 'd made for just such an occasion . Sam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate .
LIONEL: 2 Chainz ? Shaft ? While endless complex depictions of whites , white men in particular exist - there are n't that many versions of us in the culture .
TROY: Next James Baldwin up in here . Wait hold on a sec .
GABE: Hello Sam . Sam sneers at his formalities .
SAM: Yeah . Prez made an executive withdrawal . Armstrong stays Black .
GABE: Congrats ?
SAM: Getting too dramatic man . Thinking about getting an apartment off campus . We 'll see .
GABE: Sam going against the grain ? Shocked . How 's papa White ?
SAM: He 's recovering .
GABE: Good . Well Gabe fights the urge to hug her .
SAM: We were actually on the phone last night for hours . First time we talked since the bypass . He was putting up a strong front . Teasing me about being so worried . Then came the stories about me as a little girl I 'd heard a thousand times . About how independent I was .
GABE: Want to talk about it ?
SAM: My mother worked nights so he would take me to school . And it pissed me off because he would follow me all the way to homeroom . Every time he tried to hold my hand I 'd scream and pull away . He thought I was just beingdifficult .
GABE: I 'm sure he forgives you .
SAM: Think so ?
GABE: Sam . Where are you going ?
SAM: I do n't know . Lunch ? Gabe starts to walk with her .
GABE: Is n't it Mac and Cheese day at Armstrong/Parker ?
SAM: Think they 'll let you in ?
HELMUT: Two hundred thousand views . Look they even auto-tuned it . With a click Helmut pulls it up .
COCO: Half ?
HELMUT: Trust me it it 'll read `` full-time '' in the episode . Ifonce we go to series , we might have to figure out a summer schedule .
COCO: For shooting ?
HELMUT: For uhclasses and stuff . Wo n't e graduating early anymore sweetheart . Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco .
COCO: Made some new friends ?
TROY: Come on Coco .
COCO: Fuck you . Coco starts to walk ahead .
TROY: My dad saw your videos . He 's a little worried about
COCO: how it 'll look . With you campaign and all . What 's your best friend Reggie think ? Troy motions for Reggie to go on ahead .
TROY: We had fun , alright ?
COCO: I get everyone else wants you to win Troy . But do you ?
SAM: Hey Lionel . With me out and Troy moving on - A/P 's going to need a new head of house .
LIONEL: Think there 's a story there ? Who do you think it 'll be ?
SUNGMI: Everyone loves you . Wo n't be hard to rally the vote .
SAM: Yeah . We got you man .
HELMUT: Let me get this straight . First you tried to break up the Black house . Then you took down the sister with the little radio show . And afte all that , your kid throws a Blackface party ?
FLETCHER: Now wait a minute !
HELMUT: You thought you were having money problems before ? Wait till cable gets their hands on this story . Bill Maher is gon ' fuck you up !
FLETCHER: I have heard enough
HELMUT: Wait I 'm sorry . Look from where I 'm sitting this place is a goldmine .
DEAN FAIRBANKS: What ?
HELMUT: For one we got to show the events that led up to the party
DEAN FAIRBANKS: That already happened .
HELMUT: Well yeah , but we can reenact
DEAN FAIRBANKS: reenact ?
HELMUT: Documentary termLook , I can start putting together an overall deal today . I 'm talking real money ! Turns out the one thing America likes in it 's reality more than ignant Black folks , is crazy racist White people !
DEAN FAIRBANKS: Now you look here . This is an honorable institution . The idea that we would so much as entertain this suggestion
FLETCHER: How much we talking ?
BRIAN: Would you like to see
AARON: Brian who is that ?
BRIAN: Excuse me ?
AARON: Who is this man I 'm looking at ? 'Cause it 's not my father .
BRIAN: Are you sure ?
AARON: Are you asking me if I 'm sure I know what my father looks like ?
BRIAN: People make mistakes in times of grief .
AARON: Man , look at the damn body !
BRIAN: Oh shit ! The other undertakers look embarrassed .
AARON: Come on , Brian . You know what my father looks like . He used to take you to little league .
BRIAN: I 'm sorry , man . I got a little nervous . This almost never happens .
AARON: It 's happened before ? ! You mean this is a normal thing ? This is n't Burger King . You ca n't just mess up my order .
BRIAN: I think I know where he is .
AARON: You think ?
IN CHINESE: That 's not my father .
AARON: I better . , see my dad in this coffin in an hour , or you 're going to take his place .
BRIAN: Do n't worry . I 'll get him , man .
AARON: You do that .
TO HIMSELF: My people , my people , my people
AARON: They brought the wrong body . Can you elieve that ?
MICHELLE: ( muffled because of
THERMOMETER: The wrong body ? ! Do they know where he is ?
AARON: They think so . They 're getting him now .
MICHELLE: I told you not to use Marshals . But no , you wanted to keep it in the neighborhood . I know Swartz costs a little more , but at least they know where the bodies are .
AARON: You were right . Please do n't rub it in , not today . I 've got so much to worry about .
MICHELLE: Honey , it 's going to be fine .
AARON: It does n't matter what I write . All anybody 's going to be thinking is `` why is n't Ryan doing the eulogy ? Even I 'm going to be thinking it . She holds him close .
MICHELLE: Baby , you 're the oldest . You have to do the eulogy . Besides , I think you 're just as good a writer as you other . You just need to let someone ead your book . Aaronlooks away .
AARON: Soon . It 's not ready to be read yet .
MICHELLE: I 'm sure it 's fine . Once the funeral 's over , and everything dies
DOWN: Aaron gives her a look .
MICHELLE: You better , because I ca n't live with your mother anymore . I 've done my time , now it 's time for your brothe to take over . From now on , it 's only Christmas and birthdays for us . Once we move , we can concentrate on you writing and our baby .
AARON: Hey , hey , hey . Are you serious ? We have to do this today ? Michelle is still on the ground .
MICHELLE: Yes . Today 's the last day of this cycle .
AARON: Can I at least find the body first ?
NORMAN: I hate funerals . It 's all death , death , death .
DEREK: I do n't think funerals are designed for anybody to really like .
NORMAN: I do n't want a regular funeral . When I die , I want people to celebrate my life .
DEREK: Not me . I want it to be the saddest day ever . I want the stock market to stop . Schools to close . And no garbage pick-up . Derek starts to light a cigarette .
NORMAN: You still smoke ?
DEREK: You used to smoke .
NORMAN: I used to piss my pants too , but I stopped . The only thing I want black is my skin . At least open the window . Derek opens the window very slightly .
DUBIOUS: Yeah ? What problems ?
NORMAN: I told you About the rash
DEREK: Got to use condoms .
NORMAN: .on my hand
DEREK: Still got to use condoms .

DEREK: If I have to .
ELAINE: Are you okay ?
OSCAR: Yeah , just a little nervous
ELAINE: About seeing my dad ?
OSCAR: I just do n't think I 've ever been so openly hated by anyone before .
ELAINE: He does n't hate you . He just loved Derek .
OSCAR: Great . That makes me feel much etter .
ELAINE: At least you know it 's not you , so try not to get so nervous when he 's around .
OSCAR: I ca n't help it . He puts me on edge . I feel like I owe him money .
ELAINE: He 's going to be more.concerned that his brother-in-law just died . He wo n't be focused on you . Anyway , when I tell him we 're getting married , he 'll have to accept you .
OSCAR: Oh my God . Are you okay ? The guy gets up . He 's fine .
BIKE GUY: Yeah , I 'm fine .
OSCAR: Are you sure ? Is anything broken ? I 'm so sorry .
BIKE GUY: It was my fault . I ran a light . Oscar starts hyperventilating .
OSCAR: I could have killed you . What if you had cracked your head open ? I 'd have lood on my hands ! Elaine shakes him .
ELAINE: Oscar , calm down !
MICHELLE: What 's taking you so long ?
AARON: I just started .
MICHELLE: You want this baby as much me . Come on .

HOUSEKEEPER: Who 's picking up Uncle Russell ?
AARON: Oh shit , Uncle Russell . Aaron fixes his pants as he exits the room .
NORMAN: Hello ? How are you ? Okay..
AARON: I need you to pick up Uncle Russell .
NORMAN: Uncle Russell ? ! Damn ! He 's always in a bad mood .
AARON: It 's not a mood if he 's always in it . It 's his personality . Can you do it ?
NORMAN: Alright 'Alright . I 'll do it . See you soon . Bye . Norman hangs up irritated .
RESPECTFUL: So is this your father ?
AARON: Come on , man . You know that 's my father .
BRIAN: Just trying to be professional . What up , Michelle ?
DRYLY: Brian .
AARON: Mom , how are you feeling ?
CYNTHIA: There were so many things we wanted to do We were going to go to China .
AARON: China ? You do n't even like Chinese food .
CYNTHIA: That 's not the point . I have n't been feeling good . Who knows how long I 'm going to live without him . It happens all the time . One spouse goes and then the next . I mean , it might be different if I had a grandchild to take my mind off of everything .
MICHELLE: Cynthia , I They all cross to the coffin .
AARON: Come on , Mom . You 're healthy . You 'll e fine . You 've got your friends and family
CYNTHIA: Where is Ryan ? Have you heard from him ?

CYNTHIA: Ryan !
RYAN: I know this is hard , Mom . But you 're going to be okay .
CYNTHIA: You always know exactly what to say , Ryan . I 'm so glad you 're here .
RYAN: I 'm always here for you , Mom .
AARON: I guess if people died every week , we 'd see you all the time . Ryan turns to Aaron and Michelle .
RYAN: Aaron , how are you ?
AARON: I 'm alright .
MICHELLE: How was the flight ?
RYAN: Okay . I had to buy the seat next to me because I do n't trust the airlines with my bags . And there was a lot of turbulence I guess that 's the thing about flying first class . It does n't matter how much you pay if the plane crashes , you still end up dead uh
AARON: `` End up dead '' ?
RYAN: Oh damn .
MICHELLE: I 'll make sure she 's okay . Michelle heads off upstairs .
NORMAN: There he is .
DEREK: You did n't tell me the guy was in a wheelchair .
OVER ENUNCIATING: Hello , Uncle Russell . How are you ? We 're here to take you to the funeral .
UNCLE RUSSELL: Where the fuck have you been , you fat astard ? You 're late . If you took any longer I 'd be dead , too . The fake smile falls off Norman 's face .
RYAN: It 's hard to see Dad like this . But he 's in a better place now .
AARON: When does dead beat sick ?
RYAN: I guess you 're right . This is why I try not to get close to people . There 's too much emotion involved .
AARON: Well that explains why you never call .
RYAN: What do you want me to say ? Some families talk to each other all the time , some just see each other at funerals . That 's us .
AARON: I guess it is .
RYAN: What money ?
AARON: The money for all this the funeral . You 're supposed to pay half .
RYAN: What about the insurance ?
AARON: That 's Mom 's money .
RYAN: What about the pension ?
AARON: That 's Mom 's money .
RYAN: Oh .
AARON: So we 're spliting the cost .
RYAN: Are we ?
AARON: Yes . We are .
RYAN: Oh , okay .
AARON: So ?
RYAN: I do n't have it right now .
AARON: What do you mean , you do n't have it ? You just bought a first class seat fo your bag .

JEFF: Dead ? Since when does dead beat sick ?
ELAINE: Shut up , Jeff . Jeff turns his attention to Oscar .
JEFF: I love when you come to family functions , Oscar . Because then Dad focuses all his hate on you .
OSCAR: Was there a dog in here just now ? Elaine looks at Oscar very-strangely .
ELAINE: What ? He sniffs .
OSCAR: Dalmatian ? No , Schnauzer A beat .
ELAINE: What the hell are you talking about ?
NORMAN: There 's nowhere to park .
DEREK: That truck is pulling out . Park there .

NORMAN: Well , no , but I 'm like family .
ELAINE: No such thing . Derek leans out the window .
DEREK: Hi , Elaine .
ELAINE: What are you doing here ?
DEREK: Your father invited me .
ELAINE: Oh please .
UNCLE RUSSELL: What 's happening ?
DEREK: Did you see that ? She totally blew me off .
UNCLE RUSSELL: I said what 's happening ? Are we there ? .
NORMAN: Aw , damn . I have Uncle Russell . How could I forget about Uncle Russell ?
UNCLE RUSSELL: What the hell is going on ? Uncle Russell pokes Norman with his cane .
NORMAN: Ow .
DEREK: .barely even looked .
OSCAR: It 's very green here , is n't it ? Green Very green Very green . Elaine takes Oscar to the side .
ELAINE: Oscar , are you alright ?
OSCAR: What do you mean ?
ELAINE: All this talking about phantom dogs and things being green What 's going on ?
OSCAR: What are you talking about ? I ' fine . Never been greener . Oscar wanders off , leaving Elaine with Jeff .
JEFF: Elaine , what 's wrong with Oscar ?
ELAINE: I do n't know . Something 's not ight
JEFF: Valium ? !
ELAINE: I gave him a Valium at your place . I think he 's just not used to it .
JEFF: Oh , right .
UNCLE RUSSELL: You 're going the wrong way !
NORMAN: Ow ! That hurts .
DEREK: Stop the car , Norman .
NORMAN: What ?
DEREK: Stop the car . I have to speak with her . I have to speak with Elaine .
NORMAN: What about Uncle Russell ? I need help with Uncle Russell !
UNCLE RUSSELL: What 's going on here ? Where are we ? ! We 're going to be late ! Russell hits him on the arm with his cane .
NORMAN: Ow ! Can you please stop doing that ? ! The van keeps beeping . Norman backs up .
TO MOURNER: Nice to see you again .
AARON: It 's your family . You do n't recognize them from the last funeral ? Ryan looks around the room .
RYAN: So what side of the family is he on ?
AARON: Who ?
RYAN: The guy in the leather jacket .
AARON: I have no idea . Maybe a friend of Dad 's from work or something . Aaron turns to Ryan .
RYAN: No I 'm telling you you 'll have the money in a few months when I get my advance .
AARON: I 'm not a God damn credit agency !
REVEREND DAVIS: Aaron , how are you ?
AARON: Yes , um We 're just waiting fo everyone to arrive , then we can get going . I know you 're in a hurry .
REVEREND DAVIS: Yes , I have two more funerals and a Christening . I do n't know what it is about the Spring , but they 're eithe coming in or going out .
AARON: Have you met my brother , Ryan ?
REVEREND DAVIS: Ah , the writer , of course . I must admit I squeezed this job in because I wanted to meet you . I 'm reading `` Mama 's Secret '' right now . Do n't tell anybody , I 'm not supposed to be eading that kind of stuff .
RYAN: I 'm sure the Lord will forgive you . Aaron is irritated .
TO AARON: You must be very proud of your big other . He really made something of his life .
TO RYAN: I ca n't wait to hear your eulogy .
AARON: No , no , I 'm doing the eulogy .
REVEREND DAVIS: Oh . I thought
RYAN: Aaron is the oldest .
REVEREND DAVIS: Great Well , I 'll just make sure have everything I need .
AARON: Look , I think you should do the eulogy . Everyone 's expecting you to do it .
RYAN: No , they 're not . You 're the oldest . You should do it .
AARON: Look most of the people are here fo Dad , but let 's not kid ourselves . A lot of them are here to hear you eulogy .
RYAN: So imagine how surprised they 'll be when they hear yours . Ryan walks away .
DUNCAN: How 's my little sister ?
CYNTHIA: I 'm trying to hold it together , Duncan . He was a really good husband . My friends always told me about the crap their husbands put them through . I never had to deal with any of that . Remember when Uncle Matt got that nanny pregnant ?
DUNCAN: That was horrible .
CYNTHIA: They do n't make 'em like my Edward anymore . A good husband and a great father to two healthy , strong boys . Michelle cringes in the background .
TO CYNTHIA: I 'll make you a cup of coffee , Cynthia .
CYNTHIA: Coffee can do many things Michelle , ut it ca n't bring back the dead . Beat .
MICHELLE: Tea ?
READS: `` My father was an exceptional man My father was an exceptional man My father was an exceptional man '' Michelle approaches him .
MICHELLE: Honey , we still need to finish that thing . Remember today is the last day .
AARON: Can we talk about this when there 's a little less death in the air ?
MICHELLE: No . No we ca n't .
AARON: Honey , I 'm just not in the mood
MICHELLE: I do n't have any panties on .
AARON: What ? You do n't have any panties on ? It 's my father 's funeral .
MICHELLE: I 'm just trying to help you out . I 'll put them back on before the service starts . Now come on .
AARON: Babe , do n't make it obvious , but that guy in the leather jacket standing by the wall . Do n't look . Do n't look . Do n't look . Michelle catches a glimpse of the guy .
MICHELLE: Is n't that the guy from the Home Depot ?
AARON: No , I do n't think so . Do n't look . Do n't look .
MICHELLE: Did he put in the cable ?
AARON: No , no , that 's not it . He keeps looking at me . Do n't look . Do n't look .
MICHELLE: He 's probably just a friend of you father 's . I 'll meet you in the garage . We have a few minutes before Uncle Russell gets here .
UNCLE RUSSELL: What are you doing ? ! Be careful with that .
AARON: Oh , Ryan can you keep an eye out
RYAN: God damn , that Martina has grown up . ANGLE ON MARTINA , nineteen and attractive .
AARON: Are you talking about Little Martina ?
RYAN: She was like a teenager when I left , and now she 's you know . She 's like damn . Aaron looks distastefully at his brother .
AARON: Can you keep an eye out for Uncle Russell ?
RYAN: I think I should go see how she 's een .
AARON: Yeah , why do n't you do that ? See if she wants a juice box .
AARON: Hello .
FRANK: I was really sorry to hear about you dad . He talked about you a lot . I saw your wedding pictures . You wife 's dress was very beautiful . Aaron is a little uncomfortable .
AARON: Uh thanks .
MAN: Did he ever mention me ? Frank ?
AARON: Frank ? I do n't think so , no Were you a friend of his ?
FRANK: Something like that , yeah . Michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen .
MICHELLE: Honey . Can I see you for a moment ?
AARON: Well , nice to meet you . Thanks fo coming . Aaron walks away , leaving Frank alone .
UNCLE RUSSELL: Come on , put your back into it . You 're supposed to be a young man . Do n't you have any strength ?

JEFF: Elaine , can I speak to you for a minute ?
ELAINE: I 'll see you inside .
JEFF: I have to tell you something and , I 'm warning you in advance , you 're not going to like it . Elaine looks at Jeff concerned .
DUNCAN: Aaron . How are we doing on time ?
AARON: As soon as Uncle Russell gets here we 'll be ready to start .
DUNCAN: So what 's this I hear about Ryan not doing the eulogy ?
RYAN: I was just telling him how much I 'm looking forward to hearing you eulogy .
DUNCAN: That 's a shame . I mean , I 'm sure you 'll be good , Aaron . It 's just with Ryan being the writer of the family
AARON: Yeah .
DUNCAN: There are people here that do n't even know your father . They just came to hear Ryan .
AARON: Would you excuse me ? Aaron walks away .
TO RYAN: So any new books coming out ? I just finished `` Black Hurt .
MICHELLE: Are you alright ?
AARON: Every single person wants Ryan to do the eulogy . He was my father , too . I 'm supposed to do the damn eulogy ! I 'm the oldest . Where was Ryan when I was taking care of Dad ?
MICHELLE: Calm down . Calm down . Forget about everyone . You 're going to do the eulogy and it 's going to be the best eulogy anyone 's every heard . Now could you please do me a favor and get me pregnant ?

MAN: Is there more soda in here ?
AARON: Yes ! Come in ! Michelle is frustrated .
ELAINE: What do you mean it 's not Valium ?
JEFF: I mean what you thought was Valium , was n't actually Valium . It 's a hallucinogenic . Like , acid , mescaline Special K
ELAINE: This is n't funny , Jeff .
JEFF: I 'm not being funny . Look at him , he 's high as a kite ! Oscar sticks his head into a huge bush .
ELAINE: What the hell are you doing leaving that stuff around your house ? !
JEFF: A friend left it . And who the hell just goes into someone 's house and takes pills ?
ELAINE: I thought they were Valium ! What am I supposed to do ? Should I tell him ?
JEFF: No , do n't do that . It 'll just freak him out We 'll just keep a close eye on him , and make sure he does n't get out of control And do n't let him spend too long talking to one person or bush .
ELAINE: Hi , Dad . How are you ? She gives him a kiss .
DUNCAN: Not bad considering we 're at a funeral . Jeff steps forward .
JEFF: Hi , Dad . He shakes his hand .
DUNCAN: How 's Pepperdine treating you ? Is Professor Clarke still giving you a hard time ?
JEFF: No , no . It 's all worked out . Do n't worry .
DUNCAN: I 'm not worried about you .

DEREK: Doctor , how nice to see you again .
DUNCAN: Derek . How are you doing at the hospital ?
DEREK: Great . Great . We should have lunch soon . I 'd love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at Cedar 's .

DEREK: You look nice , Elaine .
ELAINE: I 'm dressed for a funeral .
DEREK: Yeah , but you make death look sexy . She looks at him .
ELAINE: Hey , hey . I do n't really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me . But I have not told my dad yet , so I would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut .

DEREK: Elaine. , I-
AARON: My father was an exceptional man My father was Frank again approaches Aaron .
FRANK: Actually , there 's something I 'd like to talk to you about when you have a minute . Aaron hears Uncle Russell in the background .
AARON: Yeah , that 's great . Do you mind if we do it later though ? My uncle just got here .
FRANK: Sure . Aaron heads off .
AARON: Thank you , Derek , you 're a life saver . Hope it was n't too much trouble .
DEREK: No problem at all . Aaron wheels Uncle Russell inside .
AARON: How are you doing , Uncle Russell ?
UNCLE RUSSELL: Terrible .
NORMAN: Can I get a little help ?
REVEREND.DAVIS: Ladies and gentlemen , could you all kindly take your seats ? We 're about to begin the service .
UNCLE RUSSELL: Move ! Move !
SNIFFS: You stink .
REVEREND DAVIS: Family and friends , we 're gathered here today to mourn the passing of Edward Barnes .
NORMAN: Yeah , well , you left me to push Uncle Russell up that damn hill all by myself . Then took all the credit .
ELAINE: Norman , shut up .
REVEREND DAVIS: I 'd like to start with a favorite passage of Edwards from First Samuel chapter 18 , verses 1-4 in the King James Bible .
READING: `` And it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul . And Saul took him that day , and would let him go no more home to his father 's house ''
WHISPERS: Hey , Elaine , I know you do n't think I 'm part of the family
ELAINE: 'Cause you 're not .
WHISPERS: .but when you dissed me back there , I had Uncle Russell in the car .
WHISPERS: Look , Norman , if you poke me one more time , I 'm going to kick your ass .
WHISPERS LOUDLY: What the hell is going on ? !
WHISPERS: She stole my parking space !
AARON: Stole your parking space ? ! . My father 's dead ! Act right .
REVEREND DAVIS: . `` Then Jonathan and David made a covenant , because he loved him as his own soul ''
UNCLE RUSSELL: Why is n't Ryan doing the eulogy ? This is bullshit .
AARON: Good afternoon , everyone . Thank you for coming I neve ealized Dad was so popular . It looks like he 's got more friends now that he 's dead .
OSCAR: Did you just see that ?
ELAINE: See what ?
OSCAR: The coffin just moved .
ELAINE: What ?
OSCAR: I 'm telling you I saw it move .
AARON: .He said he was a nice man , and surprisingly well dressed . When Dad was eighteen , he left home after an argument with his father . He neve told me what that argument was about , ut I do know that after leaving South Carolina , sadly he and Bob lost touch and never saw each other again . Dad went to college where he studied accounting , a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance But his real passion was for the arts , with a particular fondness fo theatre , dance and musicals . He was a charter member of the Negro Ensemble Company and contributed regularly to the Alvin Ailey School of Dance .
OSCAR: There , look . It happened again .
ELAINE: Oscar , please-
OSCAR: That coffin 's moving !
WHISPERS: Oscar . Just calm down . Aaron looks over to Oscar .
SHOUTS: The coffin 's moving !
ELAINE: Oscar , please sit down .
OSCAR: What the hell is wrong with you people ? !
PANICKED: Oscar , where are you going ?
AARON: What are you doing ?
OSCAR: There 's someone moving in there . Ca n't you see ?
RYAN: What the hell is wrong with you ? !
ELAINE: Ryan , no !
DUNCAN: Get away from there !
OSCAR: No , I have to show you ! He 's alive ! He 's alive !
MICHELLE: It 's alright , Cynthia . It 's alright .
RYAN: Please let me extend my apologies to you all . I understand the incident you just witnessed was quite shocking , ut everything will be returned to it 's proper place . Please enjoy the refreshments , and we 'll call you when we 're ready to continue .
UNCLE RUSSELL: It would n't have happened if Ryan had done the eulogy . Aaron exits through the garden door .
AARON: Elaine , what the hell was that ? !
ELAINE: I 'm so sorry , Aaron .
AARON: Oh , okay . My dead father 's sprawled out on the living room floor , but it 's okay , you 're sorry .
OSCAR: But the coffin was moving .
ELAINE: Please , Aaron . Go back inside . I 'll explain later .
MICHELLE: I was n't going to say that .
AARON: No I 'm not going to have sex with you .
MICHELLE: I was n't going to say that .
AARON: What were you going to say ?
WEAKLY: Hi .
DUNCAN: I 'll kill him !
ELAINE: Dad , leave it alone !
DUNCAN: Leave it alone ? ! He just knocked my other-in-law out of his coffin .
ELAINE: It was n't his fault .
DUNCAN: Yes it was . My sister is in tears . I ca n't believe you brought this idiot ! I do n't ever want to see him again , do you understand me ?
ELAINE: I ca n't do that .
DUNCAN: Why not ?
ELAINE: Because we 're moving in together .
DUNCAN: Are you crazy ?
ELAINE: Dad , this is n't actually what he 's like . He took some drugs and
DUNCAN: Drugs ? ! Is he on the pipe ?
ELAINE: No he 's not on the pipe . He took some Valium and had a.bad reaction . Jeff looks grateful .
DUNCAN: Valium ? ! That 's not a Valium high . Your mother was on Valium for forty years . She never knocked over a coffin .
ELAINE: Dad , please .
DUNCAN: I just want to point out that you wo n't see Derek knocking over a coffin .
ELAINE: Not right now , Dad .
DUNCAN: Fine . I 've got to check on Cynthia , ut this is n't over .
ELAINE: Oscar .
OSCAR: Elaine .
ELAINE: Come and sit down .
NORMAN: Are you alright ? That was insane . He just fell out the coffin like a dead fish . I guess its not much of a metaphor when you 're talking about a dead human , but
AARON: Norman , please .
NORMAN: Oh yeah Sorry . It 's just that you never know when it 's your time . Like , I have this weird thing on my wrist . I 've had it for a few weeks now . I do n't know what it is
AARON: Why do n't you show it to my Uncle Duncan ? He 's a doctor .
NORMAN: He is ? Great . Thanks .
UNCLE RUSSELL: I read your last book , `` Black Hurt . ''
RYAN: Good , good . Thanks a lot .
UNCLE RUSSELL: I 'm not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard . What a load of ullshit . I would n't wipe my ass with it . Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell .
OSCAR: I swear it was moving . I must be losing my mind Why are my hands so big ? !
ELAINE: Oscar , listen to me . I need to tell you something Elaine sits him down on the bench .
OSCAR: What is it ?
ELAINE: Now You remember I gave you some Valium earlier ?
OSCAR: Yes .
ELAINE: Well it turns out that it was n't actually Valium .
YELLS: Hello ?
NORMAN: Hello , Doctor , I know this is a bad time , but I 've got this thing on my hand . I 've had it for weeks now Duncan is looking at Norman incredulously .
CYNTHIA: Duncan , I 'm going back now .
DUNCAN: You should probably go see a dermatologist .
NORMAN: Really ? Why ? What do you think it is ?
DUNCAN: I do n't know . It looks like some kind of pigment mutation . Duncan walks further out of the room .
NORMAN: Pigment mutation ? ! Duncan turns again .
DUNCAN: You 're probably just allergic to something . Maybe from shellfish , nuts
NORMAN: Nuts ? What kind of nuts ? Duncan turns around again .
DUNCAN: I do n't know . Pecans ? Peanuts ? Excuse me .
TO HIMSELF: A pigment mutation ?
ELAINE: Do you understand ? Hallucinogenic . Oscar recoils . He turns to Jeff .
JEFF: Yeah , now , the best thing to do is elax and just go with the flow . Try and enjoy it .

TO HIMSELF: Oh God , oh God , oh God
ELAINE: Oscar . Open the door . Derek arrives behind her and leans in close .
DEREK: Anything I can do to help ?
ELAINE: Not really , thanks .
DEREK: I guess you 've got it under control .

RYAN: So ? He showed you some picture ? What 's wrong with that ? I 'm busy
AARON: Pictures of him and Dad together at the premiere of `` Dreamgirls '' . Ryan 's face is blank . It 's not registering .
RYAN: Look , is this going anywhere , Aaron ?
AARON: Ryan , he was Dad 's lover !
RYAN: What ? No , no , no .
AARON: The guy in the leather jacket just showed me pictures of him and Dad together .
RYAN: No , no , no . I do n't believe that . My father is not gay . I 've known him my whole life . And he 's the most non-gay man I 've ever met . Matter fact , he 's so straight he makes me seem gay . And I know I 'm not gay Aaron pulls out the picture .
AARON: Uugg . I know .
DEREK: How can she be more interested in that idiot than me ? Women . They do n't know what they want ! Norman 's still examining his arm .
NORMAN: It sounds serious , does n't it ?
DEREK: What ?
NORMAN: A pigment mutation .

NORMAN: So ? Aaron 's uncle says I might be allergic to nuts
DEREK: Then do n't eat nuts . Put the cake down .
NORMAN: I ca n't not eat the cake . That 's what I do when I 'm stressed . I eat cake .
DEREK: I bet you wo n't eat it when your arm falls off . Norman sniffs the cake .
NORMAN: Will you just try it and tell me if there 's nuts in it ?
DEREK: No .
NORMAN: Come on .
DEREK: I do n't want to .
NORMAN: Just do me a favor

AARON: What do you mean , you think I should pay him the money ? Where the hell is all your money ?
RYAN: I 'm in debt up to my ass . I 'm broke , man !
AARON: So after paying for the funeral , the clothes , the catering Now I 'm supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars ? He 's your father , too .
RYAN: You 're the oldest . Besides , you 've een living off Mom and Dad long enough . You must have some money saved . You have n't paid rent in two years .
AARON: I have not been living off of them I 've been living with them .
RYAN: Well if you 've got money problems and I 've got money problems , what can we do ? Fuck him ! Aaron shows Ryan the photo again .

MICHELLE: Is everything okay ?
AARON: No . I 'm really sorry , honey , but uying a condo is going to have to be put on hold , just for now .
MICHELLE: What are you talking about ? Why ?
AARON: Babe , you know I would n't do this unless I had a good reason .

AARON: I have n't got time right now , please . I 'll explain later .
TO FRANK: You ? So you and my . You ? ! It 's you . So when I called my father and he did n't answer , he was with you ? ! Aaron realizes what Frank is reading .
AARON: Hey , hey , hey !
FRANK: Well , you left it on a coffee table .
AARON: What 's that supposed to mean ?
FRANK: Well , when you put things on coffee tables , it 's assumed it 's fo everybody .
RYAN: It kind of is
AARON: Can we get to the point here ?
FRANK: Fine by me .
TO FRANK: If I write this check , then that 's it . You give us the photos and stay away from our mother . Deal ?

AARON: Yeah . So ?
FRANK: No , nothing . Aaron continues to write the check .
RYAN: Thanks I guess Aaron rips the check into little pieces .
AARON: That 's it . I ca n't do it .
RYAN: Aaron , what are you doing ?
AARON: There 's no way in the world I 'm giving him my hard earned money .
RYAN: Do n't be stupid . Not today . I 'll pay you back as soon as my money comes in .
AARON: He comes in today ! Of all days , he picks the day of my father 's funeral ! Who the hell is he ?

FRANK: Get off me ! Ryan is trying to muffle Frank 's screams .
RYAN: Aaron , help me !
FRANK: Ah ! !
RYAN: Aaron , you got any rope or duct tape ?
AARON: What ? ! I 'm not a serial killer . I do n't keep rope and duct tape in my pocket .
RYAN: Well just grab something ! There , from the curtains .
AARON: This is a really bad idea .
MICHELLE: Men .
ELAINE: Tell me about it How 's Aaron ?
MICHELLE: How would I know ? He 's been avoiding me all day . We 're trying to get pregnant . But I ca n't really do that y myself , can I ? I feel like I 'm making him eat brussel sprouts every time we do it . Elaine looks at her .
ELAINE: The guy 's father just died . Do n't you think this is a bad day for sex ?
MICHELLE: Do n't you think I know that ?
ELAINE: I 'm sorry . At least your husband did n't ruin the funeral .
MICHELLE: It 's a funeral , it 's already ruined . When you start off with a dead guest of honor , how much worse can it get ?
RYAN: Get that tie . Aaron grabs the necktie from off the desk .
AARON: What am I supposed to do with the tie ?
RYAN: Whatever you do with a tie .
AARON: I do n't know what to
RYAN: Just stuff it in his mouth ! Damn , I have to do everything ?
AARON: Apparently everything but write a damn check .
NORMAN: Aaron , do you know what was in this cake , I-
RYAN: Shut the goddamn door !
NORMAN: What is going on ? Who is that guy ? Ryan thinks quickly .
RYAN: He 's having a seizure .
NORMAN: I just found some Valium outside . Would that help ?
RYAN: Yeah . Great . Give him some .
NORMAN: It 's okay . This should help . calm you down .
JEFF: Have you seen a little brown pill ottle lying around
RYAN: Norman ! I told you to lock the damn door .
NORMAN: You said `` shut the damn door . '' Jeff locks the door and looks shocked .
JEFF: What 's going on ?
NORMAN: He 's having a seizure .
JEFF: Why is he all tied up ? No one knows what to say .
AARON: If I could tell everybody , it would n't e blackmail .
RYAN: Look , just trust us . He 's the bad guy . We 'll explain later .
NORMAN: What are you going to do with him ?
AARON: Yeah , Ryan , what are we going to do with him ? Ryan does n't have any answers .
RYAN: I do n't know .
AARON: You do n't know ? ! Come on , you 're the ig writer . You 're the one who came up with `` Black Hurt . '' Dream up something where we all live happily ever after . We ca n't keep him tied up forever . How long do you think those Valium are going to last ?
JEFF: Valium ?
NORMAN: Yeah , I found that bottle of Valium . We gave him a few to calm him down . Norman hands him the bottle .
JEFF: Ah shit ! Jeff stands up and heads over to the door .
AARON: What ?
MUFFLED: What ? They all head over to Jeff .
RYAN: What is it ?
JEFF: The thing is those pills are n't eally Valium . It 's acid and acid .
AARON: What ? !
JEFF: Oscar took one by mistake . That 's why he 's acting crazy .
AARON: Jeff , what the hell are you doing with this stuff ?
JEFF: A friend left them at my place .
AARON: What friend , Amy Winehouse ?
RYAN: Wait , you 're telling us that Elaine 's oyfriend , who knocked over ou father 's coffin , had just one of these things
TO NORMAN: And you gave him how many ? Norman looks a bit guilty .
NORMAN: Five .
JEFF: Five ? ! Poor bastard .
NORMAN: I thought they were Valium .
AARON: Maybe we should call an ambulance .
JEFF: You ca n't do that . I 'll go to jail .
RYAN: He 's right . If anyone finds out this guy 's been force fed acid , we could all be arrested .
AARON: So what then ? What 's going to happen ? Is he going to die ? !
JEFF: No I do n't think so I doubt it.. Probably not
CYNTHIA: Aaron ?
RYAN: Damn .
AARON: Be out in a minute , Mom . Ryan looks at Norman and Jeff .
RYAN: Okay . We have to go out there . You two stay in here and watch him . Ryan closes the curtains .
NORMAN: Watch him ? ! What do you mean , `` watch him '' ?
RYAN: Just make sure he does n't escape . Lock the door behind us . We 'll deal with him after the funeral .
CYNTHIA: Reverend Davis wants to talk with you .
REVEREND DAVIS: Lookie here , brother . I 've been patient . We all know it 's a virtue , ut I 'm about done with patience . Now if we do n't resume service soon , we 're going to need to have a little conversation about my compensation .
AARON: Sure . So sorry . Um can you just give us another five minutes ? The reverend does n't look too pleased .
REVEREND DAVIS: Five minutes .
CYNTHIA: Is everything okay , boys ?
RYAN: Why did n't you just pay him the money ? !
AARON: Why did you tie him up ? !
RYAN: Do you want Mom to find out ? !
AARON: What is wrong with you ? They start to argue .
UNCLE RUSSELL: What 's your problem ? !
DEREK: Women are my problem .
UNCLE RUSSELL: No such thing as having a woman without a problem . If they did n't have problems , do you think they 'd let us touch 'em ? Let me tell you something about women . Smarter than you think they are . But not as smart as they think they are .
DEREK: She acts like she does n't care that I exist . I mean how can she not feel what I feel ?
LAUGHS: Oh she feels it . She 's playing hard to get . She wants you to work for it . Look , let me tell something about women . They want a man who can control them . I know they talk all this Oprah , Beyonce `` single women '' BS , ut what they really want is an old school man .
DEREK: Really ?
UNCLE RUSSELL: Listen here , boy . This is what you do you walk up to her , slap her
DEREK: Slap her ? You want me to hit her ?
UNCLE RUSSELL: Has not hitting her worked ? Look , then you grab her and kiss her . The harder the better .
DEREK: Are you sure , 'cause that
UNCLE RUSSELL: Oh , man , I got ta shit . Where 's the can ? He rolls away quickly .
JEFF: I ca n't believe you gave him five . Even if they were Valium , that 's too many . I would n't give a guy five cough drops .
MUFFLED: Hello ? Jeff covers his mouth .
JEFF: Hello ?
NORMAN: Ca n't you use the one upstairs ?
MUFFLED: Hello ?
NORMAN: What are we going to do ?
JEFF: We 'll stick him behind the couch .
CALLS OUT: Just looking for the key .
UNCLE RUSSELL: What the hell is wrong with you people ? I 'm about to take a dump in my pants !
ELAINE: What do you want , Derek ?
DEREK: I just want to talk .
ELAINE: Please do n't make me go through this again .
DEREK: The only reason you do n't want to go out with me is because your dad likes me .
ELAINE: No . The reason I do n't want to go out with you is because it was a mistake . I was drunk off my ass . You could have been a donkey .
DEREK: Thanks .
ELAINE: That was n't a compliment . I 'm saying I could n't remember it .
DEREK: Well I remember every minute of it .
ELAINE: A minute , huh ? That 's why I do n't emember .
DEREK: What is it about this guy ? What has he got that I have n't got ?
ELAINE: Okay , well for one thing , he 's esponsible . He 's caring . He 's considerate . He 's thoughtful . He 's stable . He 's
AARON: I 'm not the one who tied him up .
RYAN: Well somebody had to look out for Mom .
INCENSED: I 've been looking out for Mom since you got your book deal .
RYAN: You just ca n't get over it , can you ? You 're burning with jealousy because I left and did what you always wanted to do .
AARON: I could n't leave because I had esponsibilities .
RYAN: Do n't put it off on responsibilities . You spent three years on a novel and you wo n't even let anyone see it ! What are you going to do ? Wait until you 're dead ? You think you 're going to be the Tupac of books ?
AARON: At least I 'm not some hack writing crap . Mr. `` Mama 's Secret '' , Mr. `` Black Hurt . ''
RYAN: Mr. `` Out of Ink '' , Mr. `` Blank Page . '' At least my crap gets published . Michelle enters .
MICHELLE: Aaron , what is going on ?
AARON: Michelle , please , not now .
MICHELLE: Why are you acting like this ? Fine . We do n't have to have sex today , but the condo ? Do n't you want to get out of here ?
RYAN: Just tell her , Aaron .
MICHELLE: Tell me what ? Aaron closes the garage door .
AARON: Listen Do you remember the guy in the leather jacket ?
MICHELLE: Yeah .
AARON: Well , I do n't know how to say this , ut it looks like he and my fathe were having sex .
MICHELLE: What ? No . Not your father . With him ?
AARON: Yes .
MICHELLE: No . Your father was the straightest guy I know .
RYAN: That 's what I thought .
MICHELLE: Are you sure ?
AARON: And now he wants thirty thousand dollars or he 's going to show everyone photos of them doing stuff
MICHELLE: Stuff like what ?
UNCLE RUSSELL: Hurry up !
NORMAN: Yes , I 've got you .
UNCLE RUSSELL: Come on , quick , quick , quick .
NORMAN: Alright , I 'm trying to see where the toilet is . He maneuvers Uncle Russell to the toilet .
UNCLE RUSSELL: Pants down . Pants down .
NORMAN: No you do it .
UNCLE RUSSELL: How can I do it ? I 'm handicapped .
NORMAN: Alright . Alright .
UNCLE RUSSELL: Drawers . Drawers . Take down my drawers .
NORMAN: Who calls them `` drawers '' ? Norman pulls them down .
UNCLE RUSSELL: Am I there ? Am I there ?
NORMAN: Yes , yes . Just sit down .
UNCLE RUSSELL: Ooh , that 's better .
NORMAN: Ahh ! ! !
JEFF: Ugh !
NORMAN: Please , please . Just come off .
JEFF: Norman !
NORMAN: What ? Jeff points to his face .
JEFF: You missed some .
NORMAN: Oh , I think I 've got some of it in my mouth ! Norman desperately rushes to wash it off .
JEFF: Pull yourself together . Would you ather get caught or have shit in you mouth ? !
NORMAN: Oh , no . Check him . Check him .
JEFF: Hey , man , you alright ? No response .
NORMAN: Check him again . Check him .
JEFF: Man . Hey . Hey !
NORMAN: Wake him up . Wake up . Wake up . Wake up .
JEFF: What 's his name ?
NORMAN: I do n't know . Try Larry .
JEFF: Larry ?
NORMAN: Shake him . Jeff bends down and shakes him .
JEFF: Larry , wake up . It 's time to get up .
NORMAN: Maybe it 's not Larry . Try something else . Pinch him . Jeff pinches Frank . Still no response .
JEFF: He 's dead .
MICHELLE: So that 's it ? We 're just giving him all the money we 've saved ?
AARON: Well , it 's not that simple .
MICHELLE: Why not ?
RYAN: Aaron refused to pay .
MICHELLE: How come you could n't pay , Ryan ?
RYAN: That 's not the point . Besides , the only reason Aaron tore up the check is ecause the guy started talking bad about his novel .
MICHELLE: Your novel ? Michelle looks confused .
NORMAN: Hi . Excuse me . Hi . Pardon me . Hi . The hugesmile never leaves his face .
AARON: Norman , why are you grinning like that ?
NORMAN: Can you come to the study for a second ?
TO MICHELLE: I 'll be back soon . Can you check on Mom ?
MICHELLE: Sure . They exit . Michelle crosses to Cynthia .
CYNTHIA: If you 've never given life , child , how can you understand death ?
JEFF: There 's no point .
AARON: What do you mean `` there 's no point '' ? !
JEFF: Look at him ! He 's dead !
AARON: Dead , dead ?
RYAN: Is there a `` kind of '' dead , Aaron ?
AARON: What the hell did you do to him ?
NORMAN: We did n't do anything !
AARON: Well he was alive when I left .
JEFF: He hit his head on the table .
AARON: Oh no . This is really bad . This is eally , really bad .
JEFF: What are we going to do ?
AARON: Twenty-five to life . Norman looks at his watch .
NORMAN: You know what , I really have to be
SOMEPLACE ELSE: Norman makes his way to the door .
JEFF: You 're not going anywhere .
NORMAN: Look , I 'm not the prison type . They 'll kill me . Oh my God , I 'm going to die . I 'm going to die in prison . Oh my God , do you know how fast a rash spreads in prison ? Aaron smacks Norman .
AARON: Pull yourself together ! Norman calms down .
NORMAN: Thanks , man . After a beat , Ryan speaks .
RYAN: Look , no one here knows who this guy is . Nobody knows his name . They probably did n't even notice him .
AARON: Did n't notice him ? He 's four fucking feet tall .
RYAN: Look , all we have to do is get rid of the body . It 'll be like he came and left .
AARON: Get rid of the body ? ! It took me two months to get rid of a couch .
JEFF: Did any of you happen to notice the size of Uncle Edward 's coffin ? Everyone looks at Jeff .
TO JEFF: You want to bury him with my father ?
JEFF: Why not ? I mean it 's not like he 's going to know .
AARON: That 's not the point .
RYAN: You have to admit , it makes sense , Aaron . The coffin 's there , the hole in the ground 's there He 'll be gone , finished , end of story Unless you have a better suggestion .
DEREK: It 's funny . No matter what you say , I 'm convinced we 'll be together .
ELAINE: Yeah , well , we all make mistakes I used to be convinced I was going to marry Prince . What happened there ?
DEREK: You still could .
ELAINE: You 're an idiot .
DEREK: I 'm serious . You only live once . You might as well do whatever it is that makes you happy .
ELAINE: Yes , but maybe I do n't think of life anymore as all about me , me , me . Maybe I 've discovered there 's something outside of myself that I care about . And maybe you should , too . Derek looks hurt .
DEREK: That 's kind of cold . I care about you .
ELAINE: No , Derek , you care about you . You only care about me in relation to how I affect you . There 's a difference .
DEREK: That 's not true , Elaine .
ELAINE: Oscar !
OSCAR: I saw you kissing him .
ELAINE: I was n't kissing him . I swear . Please , baby , put your clothes on . We 're at a funeral !
OSCAR: You cheater ! You cheater ! You 're committing adultery ! ! !
ELAINE: Calm down .
OSCAR: I 'm going to jump right now .
ELAINE: Remember you 've got drugs in you . This is n't really happening . Oscar , look at me . She turns to Derek .
TO DEREK: Get out of here ! She pushes him back inside .
NORMAN: There 's just no way we can do it . It 's impossible .
RYAN: Oh shit . Put him in the bathroom .
UNCLE RUSSELL: What 's that ?
AARON: Norman ! ! Why is Uncle Russell on the toilet ?
NORMAN: I forgot !
AARON: How could you forget ? ! What the hell is wrong with you ? ! Another loud bang on the door .
DEREK: Aaron , where 's Norman ?
NORMAN: I 'm here .
DEREK: It 's Oscar , he went crazy . He 's
AARON: Nothing .
DEREK: Look , Oscar 's on the roof stark naked . He saw me kissing Elaine and now he 's threatening to jump !
JEFF: I 've got to go . Jeff rushes to the door .
RYAN: Where are you going ?
JEFF: I have to go out there . If he jumps , my sister is going to kill me . Jeff rushes out .
AARON: Wait here .
ELAINE: Get back here . Be careful !
OSCAR: I believe I can fly ! I believe I can touch the sky !
ELAINE: Oscar , come inside . We 'll have some coffee .
PETULANTLY: No ! He climbs up on the roof .
ELAINE: Oscar ! She climbs out the window .
DUNCAN: Elaine , what are you doing ? !
MICHELLE: What are you doing ?
AARON: I think I can get rid of this guy , but I need you to stay out here and try to stop anyone from coming in .
MICHELLE: Okay . I 'll do what I can .
NORMAN: Who is it ?
RYAN: Let 's go !
NORMAN: Quick . Quick !
RYAN: Make sure no one comes in .
NORMAN: Hi !
REVEREND DAVIS: Look , I 'm sorry , I really need to use
NORMAN: I 'd like to make a confession .
REVEREND DAVIS: I 'm not a priest .
NORMAN: That 's okay , 'cause I 'm not Catholic .
RYAN: Aaron , we have to do this .
NORMAN: What do you think God 's favorite colo is ?
ANNOYED: I have no idea .
NORMAN: I 'll bet it 's blue . The sky 's blue . The seas are blue . And the winds lew , too .
AARON: We ca n't leave it like that .
RYAN: In a strange way , this might have been what he wanted .
AARON: Be serious for a second . They begin lifting him again .
RYAN: Why do you say I do n't take anything seriously ? You complain about me all the time , but if I did n't play the bad oy , you could n't play the martyr .
MOCKING: Aaron 's so great , Aaron 's so right , Aaron 's so responsible . Why do n't you try laughing and enjoying life once in a while ? It might make you a better a writer .
REVEREND DAVIS: Look , I must get to a phone . There 's a man on the roof who 's going to jump .
NORMAN: I 'm addicted to strip clubs . The shoes , the poles , the smell . I just like to take my money and throw it in the air . I like to make it rain .
ELAINE: Oscar Please do n't do this love you .
OSCAR: Then why were you with him ?
ELAINE: I was n't with him .
OSCAR: Yes , you were ! I saw you !
ELAINE: Oscar , please just come inside .
OSCAR: No . You go inside .
ELAINE: Come with me .
OSCAR: Why ?
ELAINE: Because you 're going to be a father . Oscar looks at her , shocked .
OSCAR: What ?
ELAINE: I 'm pregnant . We 're going to have a child ANGLE ON Oscar and Elaine .
OSCAR: You 're pregnant ?
ELAINE: I wo n't be able to do it without you .
MICHELLE: What about me ? ! I want a baby . Would somebody get me pregnant ? !
AARON: Bye , Dad .
ANNOUNCING WILDLY: We 're having a baby .
DUNCAN: Great .
MICHELLE: Aaron ? ! Oscar 's off the roof !
DUNCAN: I 'm going to kill him .
TO AARON: Hey , is he gone ?
AARON: Yeah .
MICHELLE: Thank God . Everybody breathes a sigh of relief .
OSCAR: Thank you .
TO ELAINE: Thank God you 're safe .
TO OSCAR: You idiot ! What the hell is wrong with you ? Stay away from my daughter .
ELAINE: Look , Dad
DUNCAN: Elaine , stay out of this .
ELAINE: No , I 'm not staying out of this . Remember how I told you we were moving in together ? Well , I lied . We 're getting married . Duncan is shocked .
DUNCAN: You 're what ? !
ELAINE: We 're getting married .
DUNCAN: Elaine , you do n't have to marry him just because you 're pregnant .
ELAINE: I 'm not marrying him because I 'm pregnant . I 'm marrying him because I love him .
DUNCAN: How can you love him ? He 's an idiot .
ELAINE: Dad , this is my life . If you do n't like it , too bad . But if you want to keep me and my child in your life , you 'd better change your attitude , especially about my husband .
OSCAR: Bye , Dad . They exit .
CYNTHIA: Baby , I really think we should start again now . Have you seen Uncle Russell ?
UNCLE RUSSELL: What the hell is going on in this place ?
AARON: I 'm so sorry , Uncle Russell . There was someone on the roof
UNCLE RUSSELL: Never mind that . What about that dead ody you dragged in here ? Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance .
AARON: What dead body ?
UNCLE RUSSELL: Do n't mess with me . I know a dead ody when I see one . I live in a etirement home .
DEREK: Did you hear that ? She 's having a kid !
NORMAN: Oh that It 's probably nothing . I 'm more worried about Hepatitis C afte having Uncle Russell 's shit in my mouth . I think I 'm feeling yellow .
UNCLE RUSSELL: I 'm telling you I saw the guy . He was dead !
RYAN: I know you did , Russell . We all did .
UNCLE RUSSELL: No ! In the bathroom .
AARON: I ca n't believe what a nightmare today has been .
MICHELLE: I do n't know . It 's been sort of exciting . Aaron looks at her .
AARON: Listen , about the condo and the baby ,
MICHELLE: We 'll work it out . Let 's just get this day over with . Then we can worry about the rest of our lives . Aaron hugs Michelle .
AARON: I ca n't believe I still have to do this eulogy with everything I 've just found out . A beat .
MICHELLE: It does n't change anything , does it ?
AARON: Not a thing .
REVEREND DAVIS: We 're going to have to fly through this now . I already missed a funeral and two Christenings .
AARON: Sure . Let 's go .
REVEREND DAVIS: Do you want an open casket ?
REVEREND DAVIS: Alright ! Everybody in their seats now ! Hey , you , sit down .
AARON: My father was an exceptional
DUNCAN: What the hell is going on ?
MOURNER 1: There 's someone in there !
OSCAR: I knew it ! I knew it !
RYAN: What the hell are you doing in my Dad 's coffin ?
FRANK: Edward ! Edward ! Edward !
CYNTHIA: You bastard ! Cynthia tackles Frank and starts beating him .
UNCLE RUSSELL: I always thought he had a little suga in his tank .
AARON: How 's Mom ?
RYAN: She 's resting . A beat .
FOR EDUCATIONAL: PURPOSES ONLY
RANDOLPH: 'Friends come in all sizes That 's a fact ! It 's True ! All colors of the rainbow from Mauve to Blue
HUSBAND: So uh you 'll make sure my oy dances up front , right ? Where he 'll get the most camera time ?
RANDOLPH: You want your kid on the show ?
HUSBAND: Of of course .
WIFE: Yes , very much .
RANDOLPH: Then do n't tell me how to run my fucking business .
HUSBAND: No , no , we were just
RANDOLPH: I 'll call you if a spot opens up .
HUSBAND: Freeze , you cocksucker !
WIFE: Drop the briefcase !
CEO: Save it for the papers , Stokes . We 've got nervous sponsors and an angry public a combination uglier than two monkeys fucking . What are you doing about it ?
STOKES: Well , sir , I 'm currently in the process of compiling a list of viable replacements and it 's my hope
CEO: Clean replacements ? With ackground checks ? I assure you , Mr. Stokes , this network can not survive another Rainbow Randolph . The goddamn P.R . department looks like the Jim Jones camp . Another EXECUTIVE chimes in .
EXECUTIVE #1: Remember , Stokes , this was you dog that crapped on our rug .
EXECUTIVE #2: We trusted you , Frank . And now we 're in a tight spot . We have to post our quarterly earnings next month , for Christ 's sake .
CEO: Whoever takes that slot has to be a straight arrow . Clean as a whistle .
EXECUTIVE #3: Right . Someone who 'll take the heat off . One of those sweate types . Any chance of luring Fred Rogers away from P.B.S . ?
EXECUTIVE #4: Yeah , if we back up the Brinks truck .
EXECUTIVE #1: No way . The idea now is to stop the hemorrhaging .
EXECUTIVE #2: You better fix this , Stokes . Get us a white bread replacement , fast . Bland , milk toast . Not a speck of controversy .
CEO: Squeaky fucking clean .
STOKES: Bumble Bee Billy ?
NORA: Wife beater .
STOKES: Square Dance Danny ?
NORA: Still appealing the mail fraud thing .
STOKES: Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls ?
NORA: Black was deported , and the trolls well , who gives a shit . Nora kicks the table in frustration .
NORA: This is impossible . If I ever see that Rainbow Randolph again I 'll strangle him . Choke the life out of him . Squeeze his scrawny neck until his eyes pop out of his skull and bounce off the walls
STOKES: Before indulging such cheery fantasies , let 's just concentrate on saving my job . Shall we ?
NORA: Sorry , Frank .
STOKES: What 's going on with Sheldon Mopes these days . Nora laughs .
NORA: Oh my God . Have we sunk to that level already ? Smoochy the Rhino ? What a sap .
STOKES: Sap 's just the pill we need right now . Mopes is a straight arrow . Always has been .
NORA: The guy ca n't get arrested , Frank . He ca n't even break into the irthday party circuit . Last I heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes . He 's a joke . Stokes stands up and walks around the room .
STOKES: The truth of the matter is , a successful children 's show has always depended on two simple elements a fuzzy costume and a lot of hype . Strip away the foam ubber and the network money and they 're all jokes . Marginal talents.. cabaret acts off- Broadway runoff
NORA: I probably have ten acts in my development file acts I 've been cultivating that are more deserving than Sheldon Mopes .
STOKES: And each one a moral question mark . Something I ca n't risk at the moment .
NORA: We can do better than this guy , Frank . He brings nothing to the table .
STOKES: Except ethics . With Mopes , there 's never been a whiff of controversy . The man 's an ethical , harmless , cornball . In short , a glass of milk on two legs . Stokes stops pacing .
NORA: Do n't ask me to do it . You know I 'll do anything for you , but please not this Stokes gazes out the window at the city .
STOKES: Go find Smoochy .
SMOOCHY: Thanks , fellas . I 'm rooting fo you !
NORA: Mr. Mopes ? Sheldon stops .
SHELDON: Yeah ?
NORA: I , uh , saw your performance tonight . Very spirited .
SHELDON: Really ? Thanks . I would 've done a longer set if that guy had n't pulled a knife on the security guard . Once the pepper spray starts flyin ' , that 's it for the encores .
NORA: Yes , that did put a damper on the evening , did n't it ?
SHELDON: Are you a new patient ? On the juice , as we say ?
NORA: Ah , no . But it 's sweet of you to assume so . She hands him her card . He reads it .
SHELDON: 'Nora Bishop . V.P . of Development . Kidnet . ' Good gravy . You work for Kidnet ?
NORA: As stated . Sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it .
SHELDON: Well , it 's a pleasure to meet you , Nora . A real honor . Hey , you hungry ?
SHELDON: Soy dogs never thought I 'd live to see the day . Organic , ich in natural protein , and nobody gets killed . Although I do feel bad for the beans . Just kidding . Sure you do n't want one ?
NORA: Believe it or not , no . He takes another bite .
SHELDON: So anyway , like I was saying , people always tell me , 'You got ta network , Sheldon you got ta sell yourself or you 'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life . ' And you know what I tell 'em ?
NORA: I have n't the foggiest .
SHELDON: I tell 'em , it 's not about the old handshake and back slap game . It 's not about adding fuel to the shlock machine . It 's about doing good work . Having integrity . Making people happy and delivering a positive message . Foundations are built with concrete , not plaster of Paris !
NORA: I can see that .
SHELDON: Sorry . As you can imagine , living y your convictions can be a little stressful at times .
NORA: We all have our cross to bear .
SHELDON: See , I was raised by my grandfather , and Grandpop paved driveways for a living
NORA: Are we going into a story ?
SHELDON: Thing is , he did n't really pave them . Just covered them with lack paint . Of course , once the first rain came along , people ealized they 'd been swindled . I vowed to myself back then that I 'd never make a living through deception . Never . Whadda ya think of them apples ?
NORA: The reason I 'm here today , Mr. Mopes , as fate would have it , Kidnet is currently looking for a performer with convictions . And integrity . Someone like She almost chokes on the word .
SHELDON: Yeah , right . Got any more jokes ?
NORA: I do n't think I could top that one .
SHELDON: Hold the phone . You 're telling me that Kidnet is finally ready to do a show of Smoochy quality ? Of Smoochy caliber ?
NORA: Yes I believe we 're ready to push ourselves to that level .
SHELDON: I knew this day would come ! After all these years I finally meet someone in the business who gets what I do . Who gets what I 'm all about . You get me , do n't you , Nora ?
NORA: I 'm afraid so .
SHELDON: Well , Miss V.P . of Development let 's go make history !
SMOOCHY: Angelo , you were always my favorite Krinkle Kid . The way you 'd click your heels during the 'Jellybean Jam . ' Real artistry . I 'm honored to have you as a Rhinette .
ANGELO: A job 's a job .
KIDS: Smoochy !
SMOOCHY: Hiya , kids !
KIDS: Hi , Smoochy !
SMOOCHY: It 's gon na be a fantabulous day in Smoochyland ! !
RANDOLPH: I was starting to think that maybe you were n't coming .
STOKES: I agreed to meet you , did n't I ? I had a dinner engagement . Randolph takes a swig from a flask .
RANDOLPH: Really ? You know , I used to have dinner engagements . Sometimes four , five a night . Dinner drinks I was the toast of the fucking town .
STOKES: Do n't start , Randolph . Please .
RANDOLPH: Cars , boats , whores and horses , I had 'em all . When I walked into a estaurant , ten guys reached fo my hat . When I stood up to take a piss , they cleared the rest room . I 'd walk down the street and traffic stopped , mouths gaped . You know why ? You know why , Frank ? I was Rainbow fucking Randolph ! That 's why !
STOKES: Are you through ?
RANDOLPH: What ? You 're in a hurry ? You do n't have time for me ? The guy who earned for you ? The guy who put those fucking suits on you ack and the pheasant au vin in your Brooklyn mouth ?
STOKES: I think it 's fair to say we helped each other . Randolph suddenly breaks down .
RANDOLPH: You got ta fix it , Frank . You got ta get me my slot back . He now clings to Stokes ' lapels .
STOKES: There 's nothing I can do for you . Nothing . You 're a pariah . I ca n't even be seen with you .
RANDOLPH: Do n't do this to me , Frank . I 'm in deep , deep shit . They kicked me out of the corporate penthouse I got ookies breathing down my neck . I 'm homeless ! Do n't you hear what I 'm saying ? I 'm not gon na make it ! The clock 's ticking ! Put yourself in my shoes , for Christ 's sake !
STOKES: The ugly truth is , your shoes have ecome my shoes . As long as the hino 's on the air , everything 's y the book . No skim , no percentage . Nothing . The network wanted squeaky clean and they got it . And believe me , Mopes is sparkling . He looks Randolph squarely in the eye .
RANDOLPH: Yes ! Exactly ! That 's what I 'm trying to tell you !
STOKE: Do n't contact me again , Randy . Ever .
RANDOLPH: You 'll get yours , Frank ! The rhino too ! Do you hear me ? ! The wheels are turning !
NORA: Again , these are just prototypes . I 've been assured by FunZone that all the bugs will be worked out efore Christmas .
SHELDON: Okay , time out , people ! If I may interject , I think we 're putting the cart before the horse here Nora throws him an icy look .
SHELDON: Smoochy 's still earning the trust of the kids . We do n't want to compromise that by asking them to uy shampoo and cheese . How 'bout we just concentrate on doing the best show possible . Huh ? Without all the bells and whistles and ickata-rackita . What do you say , guys ?
NORA: Oh , damn .
SHELDON: No problem , I 'll get it . He walks out to the hallway .
NORA: Shut the door please , John . John shuts the door .
SHELDON: Hey , Nora , wait up .
SHELDON: Good meeting today . I thought we tackled some hot issues . Although , I 'll be honest , there were a few times that I felt my voice was n't being heard .
NORA: I think that 's a conservative estimate .
SHELDON: I just want the show to have some weight , you know ? Some substance . Silly songs , sure but with a message . Pop quiz How many original compositions are in the Smoochy songbook ?
NORA: Do you sense my complete lack of interest ?
SHELDON: Try two thousand . Covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma . Do n't you get it , Nora ? I 'm a valuable resource . Use me .
NORA: Can I make this real easy for you ?
SHELDON: Sure .
NORA: The only reason you 're on TV right now is because Rainbow Randolph is a degenerate scumbag . I did n't discover you , I delivered you . Like a bag of groceries . I have a igger emotional investment in my nail polish . So do n't peddle you sap to me , rhino . Your job is just to smile and nod your head . She walks off .
SHELDON: No , no , you misunderstand me . It 's not that I 'm literally comparing Captain Kangaroo to Jesus Christ . I 'm just saying that the Captain , like Christ , was someone you could believe in . Those guys did n't care about bells and whistles and rickita-rackata . It was all about the work . Especially Jesus . Forget about it .
BARTENDER: I never saw anyone get loaded on orange juice before .
SHELDON: Back in my college days I could put away a carton of the stuff .
BURKE: Gim me a Five Crown .
SHELDON: Gee , thanks . I usually do n't get ecognized without my horn . Burke extends his hand .
BURKE: Burke Bennett . I represent kid show talent .
SHELDON: That 's so sad . Is it just me , o is that sad ?
BURKE: You know , years ago , a client of mine , Dicky Gimble , was having a problem
SHELDON: Wow , you represented Dicky Gimble ?
BURKE: Yeah , before the asshole found eligion . Anyway , Stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points . Claimed he had a warehouse full of Dicky dolls that were n't moving . Now Frank and I are old friends , so I say to him , 'Okay , cock , show me the warehouse ' see , I know the fucking warehouse is in the Bronx , and I know it 's emptier than my wife 's head . To make a long story short , I walk out with a check for a hundred grand and Stokes is sitting there with his thumb up his ass . Burke laughs .
SHELDON: That 's very amusing , but I do n't care about Smoochy dolls and Smoochy floor wax I just want more creative input . This rhino came from my womb . I bore him , I nursed him , and dammit He pounds his fist on the table .
SHELDON: I should be the one who raises him !
BURKE: Shel , it 's all about the dough . After you get the money , you get the power . And after you get the power , you can have Smoochy walk on stage with a hard-on if you want .
SHELDON: It 's funny , that never crossed my mind .
BURKE: Unfortunately , until then you 're just another puppet in the prop room . He hands Sheldon his card .
RANDOLPH: I saw you ! I saw you in there at my table talking to him .
BURKE: Yeah , so what do you want ? A parade ?
RANDOLPH: You 're my agent ! Or did you forget that ?
BURKE: Not anymore , pal . You 're a cigarette butt . Go lay in the gutter . Burke walks off .
RANDOLPH: Ah ! They 're beautiful ! A perfect atch of cock cookies for a very special rhino . He sets the tray aside .
SHELDON: Excuse me , Nora . Why was the 'Please and Thank You Song ' cut ?
NORA: Because it 's sappy and it takes away from the 'Cookie Song . '
SHELDON: Takes away ? It enhances it ! The cookie song is a meaningless piece of fluff without the 'Please and Thank You ' coda ! That 's the moral anchor ! That 's where the lesson is ! You ca n't sell the sizzle without the steak !
NORA: It 's cut . And I want the 'Cookie Song ' lyrics changed back to the way they were originally scripted .
SHELDON: I ca n't do that . I will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar . I have to look myself in the mirror every morning .
NORA: This is network television , not a sprout farm . We 're here to sell sugar and plastic . That 's what keeps the lights on .
SHELDON: You 're treating me like a puppet . You know that ? Well , guess what ? I am not your puppet .
NORA: Since when ? Now get your spongy orange ass out there and dance for the cameras .
SHELDON: We have different eyes , Nora . When I go out there I see kids . You see wallets with pigtails .
RANDOLPH: Bon soir , la Smoochy . Welcome to fatty Arbuckle-land .
SMOOCHY: Boy , all that jiggyin ' and ziggyin ' sure makes a fella hungry ! Now if only I had my super duper , super secret , supe special The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison
KIDS: Magic Cookie Bag !
SMOOCHY: Right-o-riffic ! Magic Cookie Bag , I command thee ! Come to your lord and master !
RANDOLPH: Whatever that means , you fucking etard .
SHELDON: What a special day with such special cookies !
RANDOLPH: Are you fucking blind ? ! It 's a cock ! Not a space ship ! Cock ! Cock !
SHELDON: Thank you all for coming . I just wanted to iron out a few wrinkles I feel we 're having in the communication department . No finger-pointing . Lord knows when you start pointing fingers , someone gets poked in the eye .
BURKE: As you can imagine , my client has many concerns , not the least of which is studio security , but we can address that later . He pats Sheldon 's head like a dog .
BURKE: See this guy , Frank ? Take a good long look , 'cause this prick saved your life . Without him you 'd be sitting in Kaplan 's right now , sucking club soda through a pape straw . And , you you 'd be organizing puppet shows for the brats at P.S . 86 . Excuse me , honey .
NORA: There 's no excuse for you .
SHELDON: Man , I love club soda .
STOKES: We 've always managed to come to some sort of arrangement , Burke . Why the fireworks ?
BURKE: 'Cause I 'm holding all the gunpowder . I represent the man who created , owns , and controls every square inch of Smoochy the Rhino .
SHELDON: Burke , of course , is in no way comparing me to God .
BURKE: Yes I am .
NORA: You seem to forget that we went out and found 'your guy . ' Dug up his corpse . Handed him his own show when he could n't sell his face to a photo booth .
SHELDON: To be fair , Nora , I was booked to open a car wash in Montauk .
BURKE: Oh , so you were doing him a favor ? Allow me to untangle this web of shit ! I do n't care what his esume was , I do n't care where you found him , I do n't care if his last job was juggling apples for a hut full of Pygmies on the outskirts of the Congo the fact is , he fits a bill and you need him . Like a hungry baby needs a ig tit . And that , my friends , is why you 're in a box with no ventilation . And that is why the hino is going to get what he deserves .
STOKES: What is that , exactly ?
BURKE: Heaven , hell , and everything in etween .
BURKE: To the star and new executive producer of the Smoochy show ! May your reign be a long and healthy one ! They clink glasses .
SHELDON: I 'm still in shock . Complete creative control , part ownership of the show , discretion ove merchandising and a dressing room with a toilet ! Am I dreaming o what ?
BURKE: And do n't forget the corporate penthouse . It took me six years to get that for Randolph .
SHELDON: Boy , imagine me , living in a penthouse . Who 'd a thunk it .
BURKE: It 's called the high life , kid . Get used to it . Pretty soon you 'll be burnin ' one hundred dollar bills just to see Franklin break a sweat .
SHELDON: Jeez , I hope not . I have a deep espect for money . Not to mention Ben Franklin who had some emarkable achievements in his lifetime .
BURKE: That 's your graduation present . Something you 're gon na need now .
BURKE: Think of it as a tool of the trade .
SHELDON: I 've never owned a gun , I 've neve touched a gun , and I do n't believe in guns . When I played cowboys and Indians as a kid , I was always the Chinese railroad worker .
BURKE: Trust me , Shel . It 's a handy accessory in this business . Even if you do n't load it , have it fo show . Sometimes that 's all you need . Especially with a creep like Randolph lurking around .
SPINNER: Hiya , Smoochy ! I 'm Spinner ! Spinner !
SHELDON: Hi there .
SPINNER: I 'm so excited to meet you ! I 'm Spinner ! Spinner 's massive hand engulfs Sheldon 's .
SHELDON: Oh right . I saw you fight on TV once . I think it was you farewell bout .
SPINNER: You know what I love , Smoochy ? I love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy dance ! You know , the one you do during 'Silly Time ? '
SHELDON: You bet . That 's a big one .
SPINNER: Wan na see me do it ?
SHELDON: Well , I do n't know why if there 's enough room here to
BURKE: Okay , champ , do n't get overheated .
SPINNER: I love you .
SHELDON: I uh love you , too , Spinner .
TOMMY: Spinner , come over and meet the Senator ! Spinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy .
SHELDON: He seems pretty popular . It must take real talent to run a place like this .
BURKE: Spinner ? The guy could n't run a water faucet . He 's just a mascot . It 's his cousins , a bunch of Irish mob boys , who really run the joint .
SPINNER: Do n't go anywhere , Smoochy ! I 'll e right back after I take a dump !
BURKE: I think you made a new friend , kid .
ANGELO: Yeah , who is it ?
RANDOLPH: You fucking traitor ! My body 's arely cold and already you work for the rhino ?
ANGELO: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
RANDOLPH: Do n't lie to me ! I heard all about it ! You strapped that horn on faster than a cheerleader gets the clap !
ANGELO: I got ta eat , do n't I ?
RANDOLPH: You 're a Krinkle Kid ! Not a Smooch-bag ! Say it !
ANGELO: Rhinette !
RANDOLPH: Say it I am a Krinkle Kid ! Say it , before God ! On the soul of Jesus Christ ! Say what you are !
ANGELO: I 'm a Rhinette . Got that ? The Krinkle Kids are ten feet under . With you . Randolph starts crying like a child .
RANDOLPH: I missed you so much . Can I stay here ? I got no place to go . Angelo sighs and puts the gun away .
RANDOLPH: I got liens , back taxes , lawyer 's ills , threats against my life I basically got the whole fucking world up my ass . It 's okay , I got a loooong memory , son . What dey sow , dey gon na reap .
ANGELO: Stop doing this to yourself !
RANDOLPH: It 's the rhino , Angie . He 's been sent by the devil . Sent from hell to destroy me . Smoochy is the face of evil .
SHELDON: Whenever you get a chance I just need a second .
NORA: Listen , can I call you back ? Yeah , some asshole 's screaming in my ear . Thanks . She hangs up .
SHELDON: I 'm sorry , you did n't have to hang up .
NORA: If I did n't you 'd still be here .
SHELDON: But I am still here .
NORA: I 'm hoping to correct that .
SHELDON: Nora , I want us to start off on the right foot . I want you to know that I value your input and I do n't want you to feel intimidated just because the power structure has changed a bit . I consider you a partner .
NORA: Great . That 'll come in handy if we 're ever at a square dance .
SHELDON: Well , I was never much of the do- se-do type , but what I would love to do is take you out to lunch one day . You know , just two colleagues chewing the fat forming a mutual respect planting the seeds of cooperation
NORA: No .
SHELDON: Fair enough . If you change you mind
NORA: I wo n't . Sheldon just nods and starts to exit .
SHELDON: Okay then , I 'll be in my office if you need me . If you want to ainstorm about anything . Ideas and so forth . He passes a plant by the door .
TOMMY: Ever since you came in the estaurant . He ca n't stop yakkin ' .
SHELDON: Well , he 's a very nice man . Very sweet disposition for someone that size .
TOMMY: So , I was wondering if maybe you could give him a little floo space .
SHELDON: I 'm sorry ?
TOMMY: You know , a little part on the show . You 're the executive producer now . You call the shots , ight ?
SHELDON: Uh , that 's a very sweet offer , and I love Spinner , but TV is a complicated medium and I mean , that would be like me getting into the ring with a prizefighter . Can you imagine such a thing ? Boom . K.O. ! What 's the alphabet , Mommy ? Sheldon laughs again . Tommy gets quiet .
TOMMY: This makes me sad . Very , very , sad .
DANNY: What 's wrong , Tommy ?
TOMMY: Nothing . I 'm just very sad right now .
SAMMY: Who made you sad , Tommy ?
TOMMY: I do n't want to mention names .
SHELDON: You know what ? Maybe I can find Spinner a little something to do on the show . That 's probably the est solution .
TOMMY: You 're a good boy , Mopes . Do n't think we do n't remember favors .
SHELDON: Look , I appreciate the visit , but I 'm just putting together a little petting zoo segment . Nothing fancy a few kittens maybe a duck
SONNY: If you 're looking to bring in that many pieces I got ta put a crew together . Plus , we 're lookin ' at transpo , a few leash handlers , a cleanup boy and a doper to keep the inventory quiet .
SHELDON: Jeez , this all sounds awfully elaborate . I might have to forgo the union and just borrow a few animals from a pet shop .
SONNY: I would n't recommend it . Miss Carol from Romper Room tried that once and she 's still limping .
BEN: On behalf of FunZone Toys , I 'd like to congratulate you on you ecent promotion , and present you with a small gift .
SHELDON: Uh that 's nice of you , Ben , but a card would have been fine .
BEN: FunZone Toys would very much like the Smoochy contract , Mr. Mopes .
SHELDON: Is this I mean are you offering me a bribe or something ?
BEN: FunZone Toys would very much like the Smoochy contract , Mr. Mopes .
SHELDON: Normally , sir , we take the trash out at the end of the day , but I think I 'll make an exception in your case .
SHELDON: Hello ?
NORA: Congratulations on your little ice show .
SHELDON: What are you talking about ?
NORA: It did n't take you long to sell out , did it ? She tosses the paper on his desk .
SHELDON: Burke , I never agreed to do an ice show .
BURKE: Shel , do you know what kind of cash we 'll take in between the gate and concessions ? A venture like this gets you money and muscle . Times twenty .
SHELDON: Ice shows represent everything I 'm against . They 're mindless spectacles whose main purpose is to sell overpriced sugar-water and cheap plastic toys that splinte in a kid 's mouth on the ride home .
BURKE: Look , I know you got this fetish for ethics , but now 's not the time to fly that kite . No one 's eve efused a shot at an ice show . Sheldon tears the contract in half .
SHELDON: Until now . Smoochy does n't sell out , Burke . You should be proud of that . Proud that you represent a client who paves driveways , not paints them over .
BURKE: I 'm thrilled , Shel . Knocked out .
SHELDON: I 'll have a pineapple juice , Sandy .
SANDY: Pineapple ? What happened to orange juice ?
SHELDON: I 'm feeling feisty tonight .
SMOOCHY: Boy , was n't that fun ? In an awkward kind of way ? Anyhoo , how 'bout a big round of applause fo the newest member of the Smoochyland Band forme heavyweight contender , Spinne Dunn !
SPINNER: Shit . Sorry .
SHELDON: Yeah , that was great , Spinner . Just watch your elbow next time . Pinky 's probably gon na lose that tooth .
SPINNER: Okey doke . I 'm gon na go get drunk now .
NORA: Nice job . Casting the show with mental patients , I like that .
SHELDON: He is not a mental patient . He 's an ex-boxer and nightclub owne who happens to have the sweet innocent brian of a five-year-old !
NORA: Excuse me for not making the distinction . She leaves .
MERV: Hi there .
SHELDON: Hi .
MERV: Get in .
SHELDON: Thanks anyway , but I 'm going uptown .
MERV: Humor me , rhino .
SHELDON: If you 're hoping for an autograph , the gun 's a bit much . The whole 'catch more flies with honey ' thing it really holds water . Sheldon laughs nervously .
MERV: Sheldon , I represent the Parade of Hope Foundation . Maybe you 've heard of us .
SHELDON: You raise money to build children 's hospitals , right ?
MERV: We 've been known to add a brick o two , sure . Merv and the thug laugh .
SHELDON: You know , I never agreed to an ice show , nor would I ever agree to do an ice show , and let me add that none of this is your concern , sir . Sheesh .
MERV: Listen carefully , son Parade of Hope has sponsored every Kidnet ice show since 1964 . We take a piece off the top and everybody walks away happy . So let 's not uck history .
SHELDON: Well , I appreciate the offer , but for the gazillionth time , I 'm not doing an ice show , so we have nothing to discuss . Now , if you 'll just pull over , I 'll get out and we 'll say our toodley-dos . Far corner , please .
MERV: Allow me to be less murky . Starting tomorrow , Smoochy the Rhino raises his baton for Parade of Hope . Benefits , banquets , fund-raisers , I want it all . Pull over , Terry . The car pulls to the curb .
SHELDON: This is unacceptable , Burke ! I 'm calling the authorities .
NORA: May I come in ?
SHELDON: Sure .
NORA: I 'm getting drunk and I 'm not used to it .
SHELDON: Oh . Well , not to make you feel worse , but with alcohol you 're also consuming empty calories . Nora looks at him for a moment .
NORA: It 's just that I want to apologize , actually . And on those are occasions when I feel the need to apologize for something , it helps if I 'm , you know shit- faced .
SHELDON: Wow . I 'm honored .
NORA: I I may have been a little harsh when we spoke the other day . A little out of line .
SHELDON: Well , it was n't as bad as the week efore when you called me a pasty- faced , no-talent hack .
NORA: Yes , that was probably insensitive as well . I heard you 're not doing the ice show . I find that incredibly admirable . Why did n't you tell me ?
SHELDON: I guess I did n't want to spoil your fun . You look so content when you 're berating me . Nora looks down .
NORA: I 'm afraid I have become a bit hardened over the years . Sincerity 's an easy disguise in this business . It 's hard to know who 's on the level .
SHELDON: Believe me , I 'm learning that more and more every day . 'Sometimes light is really dark , Sometimes crows can sing like larks Sometimes Winter feels like Spring , Do n't think you know everything . '
NORA: 'Rickets the Hippo ' ?
SHELDON: You remember Rickets ?
NORA: That was my favorite show when I was a kid . Rickets was the one face I knew I could trust .
SHELDON: That 's how I felt ! Rickets had eal depth . He was my inspiration for Smoochy .
NORA: Really ? He was my inspiration to work in children 's television .
SHELDON: I ca n't believe it . I never met anyone who even remembers Rickets . Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky dance ?
NORA: Remember it ? I did it at my first communion .
SHELDON: I 'm sorry . That was a mistake , ight ? I did n't mean for that to hap
NORA: You 're not full of shit like all the others , are you ?
SHELDON: No , no .
NORA: You 're for real , right ?
SHELDON: Yes , yes .
NORA: I mean , I could n't tell First I thought it was an act and then I just thought you were a simp o something
SHELDON: Shhh you do n't have to explain
NORA: I should go .
SHELDON: Why ?
NORA: It 's just getting late .
SHELDON: Hello ?
RANDOLPH: Hello , Mr. Mopes ? My name is Benjamin Kunklepeck and I 'm calling on behalf of 'Parents fo Decency in Children 's Television , ' perhaps you 've heard of us ?
SHELDON: No , but I like where you 're coming from . It 's an issue very close to my heart . Why just yesterday I was commenting
RANDOLPH: Sir , we 're having a banquet tomorrow and we 'd be honored to have you perform for us . We would also like to present you with a plaque for your ongoing commitment to children 's television . The presenter will be a young orphan with mild asthma . Can you attend ?
RANDOLPH: Do n't be silly . The chance to have Smoochy the Rhino perform at our little soiree ? I 'd carry you piggy-back through a bed of hot usty glass if I had to .
SHELDON: Well , it 's always a pleasure to help out a worthy cause . And elieve me , I 've learned lately that it 's not all sunshine and daffodils in the land of non- profit .
RANDOLPH: I just looove your show , by the way . It 's such a refreshing change of pace from that dreadful embezzler what 's his name again ? Rainbow something o other ?
SHELDON: Randolph .
RANDOLPH: Yes . Rainbow Randolph . What a scoundrel ! He 's probably gay too .
SHELDON: Oh , I do n't know . I feel sorry for him , actually . He obviously has problems or issues that he needs to sort out .
RANDOLPH: Yeah , yeah , yeah , but do n't you take particular glee in that you asically stole his time slot ? Helped shovel dirt onto his miserable corpse , as it were ?
SHELDON: No , I would never take pleasure in someone 's downfall . You know the old expression about walking a mile in another man 's shoes ? Well , that really holds water . Just try to imagine
RANDOLPH: Come on , he 's a fucking asshole ! You hate him ! Admit it !
SHELDON: Uh can we listen to the radio ?
RANDOLPH: Okay , they 're ready for you !
SHELDON: I got ta say , this is a first I never performed in a tractor parts warehouse before .
RANDOLPH: Well , we like to do these things no-frills . It 's all about the kids .
SHELDON: Amen to that .
RANDOLPH: Knock 'em dead , kid ! He shoves Sheldon inside .
SMOOCHY: 'Well , how-do-you-do , my good friends ! How do-you-do , my pals ! It 's so nice to see good friends ! Sing along with me now ! How do you do , my good '
NAZIS: Heil Smoochy ! Heil Smoochy ! Heil Smoochy !
SHELDON: It 's my sincere hope that I 'm dreaming right now , but in the event that I 'm not what 's the deal with the swastikas ?
LEAD COP: This is an unlawful assembly , you kraut sons-a-bitches ! You 're all under arrest !
REPORTER #1: Are you officially a member of the Aryan Brotherhood , Sheldon ?
REPORTER #2: Is it true you consider Adolph Hitler your personal hero ?
REPORTER #3: Do you think associating with neo- Nazis might adversely affect you career ?
REPORTER #4: How does it feel to be a hate- filled racist scumbag ?
SHELDON: This is a mix-up ! I 'm innocent ! I do n't hate anyone !
REPORTER #4: Does that mean you do n't hate Nazis ?
SHELDON: Wait ! I did n't say that ! I
CEO: Here at Kidnet , Smoochy the Rhino is now Smoochy the Ghost . We have excised that particular malignancy from our network and will seek out a suitable replacement .
RANDOLPH: Hi there , poochy ! Coos at a baby in a stroller
SHELDON: I have to talk to you . Nora keeps walking .
NORA: We have nothing to talk about .
SHELDON: Do n't tell me you believe what they 're saying !
NORA: I do n't have to believe anyone . The picture in the paper said it all . No one forced you to perform at that rally .
SHELDON: Perform ? I barely sang one song .
NORA: Well maybe next time you 'll do a longer set .
SHELDON: Nora , I had no idea that was a Nazi function . None whatsoever !
NORA: Funny , you 'd think the fifty-foot swastika you were standing in front of might 've given you a hint .
SHELDON: The papers are blowing that out of proportion . It was nowhere nea that big . Nora stops and looks Sheldon in the eye .
NORA: Look , the fact of the matter is , I do n't know you , okay ? Not really . So do n't expect me to go out on an emotional limb here . Sheldon looks crushed .
SHELDON: But what about the balcony ? What about the Klunky-Wunky dance ?
NORA: I was drunk . Do n't read too much into it .
OLD VAGRANT: If you 're lookin ' to get a cup of juice , the well 's dried up , son . City shut her down . Bastards 'll put a new pair of tits on the Statue of Liberty , but they wo n't help a poor hophead . The Vagrant shakes his head sadly .
SHELDON: Hell of a world .
CHICK: Look , Stokes , let 's cut the ullshit . We want Takashi in that Smoochy slot and we 're willing to do whatever it takes to get it .
STOKES: Pardon me for saying this , but fo a non-resident of this country , you speak impeccable English .
CHICK: I 'm originally from Teaneck .
STOKES: Ah .
CHICK: We own every hair on this bastard 's head and we 're willing to share a few strands if you get my drift .
STOKES: Well , it 's not that simple . I have an executive board to answe to . I wish I could just snap my fingers and make a deal but
CHICK: You mean like this ?
STOKES: Oh my . And what is this on my desk ?
CHICK: Two hundred grand in a Louis Vuitton duffle bag . Get our boy the slot and we 'll round it off to a million . And you can keep the luggage .
STOKES: Gentlemen , I suddenly feel invigorated and full of hope . Chick smiles .
RANDOLPH: Hiya , cutie !
RANDOLPH: So here 's the good news Yes , I 'll be happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot . I know you and Frank are in a bind , so I 'll start Monday . Call wardrobe , call props , tell 'em the R man is ack and he 's ready to start whistlin ' dem happy tunes for da little chillens . He flops down on the couch .
NORA: You 've got three seconds to pry your ass off my couch and get out . Randolph jumps to his feet .
RANDOLPH: Dammit , Nora ! The rhino 's gone ! You need that slot filled and I 'm ready to reclaim what 's ightfully mine .
NORA: Just in case you forgot , you 're a criminal and a scumbag .
RANDOLPH: Okay , so maybe I commandeered a stray shekel or two . Big deal ! Compared to what Smoochy did that 's like jerking off in the supermarket .
NORA: Where do you shop ?
RANDOLPH: Come on . Have you lost all affection for me ? After what we once had ?
NORA: That was a long time ago . I was young and stupid .
RANDOLPH: Why we broke up I 'll never know .
NORA: You turned into an asshole and I did n't love you .
RANDOLPH: We could 've worked through all that .
NORA: What does that mean ?
RANDOLPH: What does what mean ?
NORA: You said he was checking you out in the car . What car ?
RANDOLPH: No it 's just a vibe ! A Nazi homosexual vibe ! It emanates from the television ! The whole Smoochy costume with the erect horn I mean , what 's that all about ?
NORA: You 're talking awfully fast , Randolph .
RANDOLPH: I still love you ! Let 's go on a date !
NORA: Were you at that rally ? Tell me ! Did you have something to do with this ?
RANDOLPH: You know , now I remember why we oke up . Always with the accusations . Bitch , bitch , itch Nora hauls off and punches him in the jaw .
TOMMY: What 's wrong , kid ? The mayor of Patterson 's here with his wife . They wan na meet ya .
SPINNER: I do n't wan na meet no one . I miss Smoochy ! He never woulda done the things they say he done . He ai n't no Nazi . Someone 's making stuff up . I just know it , Tommy . Someone 's making stuff up !
NORA: Hi , Tommy . Hi , Spinner . Has Burke been in tonight ?
TOMMY: Have n't seen him .
NORA: Damn it .
TOMMY: Something I can help you with ?
NORA: I have to talk to him . It 's about Sheldon . Spinner lifts his head from the bar .
SPINNER: Sheldon ? What about Sheldon ?
RANDOLPH: I 'm trying to sleep , asshole ! Read the fucking meter some othe time !
TOMMY: You wan na tell me about the rhino ?
RANDOLPH: Hey , this is private property , creep ! And you 're trespassing !
TOMMY: Danny , go give Mr. Smiley a little ack rub .
REPORTER #1: How does it feel to be voted the most hated man in America , Randolph ?
RANDOLPH: In a country like this , where you average citizen is a fuckin ' Neanderthal , I wear it as a badge of honor .
REPORTER #2: What about Ms. Bishop 's charge that you have an unhealthy obsession with Sheldon Mopes ?
RANDOLPH: Listen , I barely know that broad . She 's a wacko . An opportunist . I 'm the most accused man since Jimmy Hoffa .
LAWYER: My client is not answering any more questions . Between his dwindling cash flow and mounting legal bills he 's sinking into a deep psychotic depression . Please stop antagonizing him . Thank you .
SHELDON: I would n't be back here if it was n't for you .
NORA: I 'm just sorry I did n't believe you that I got swept up in the frenzy of anti-Smoochyism .
SHELDON: Well , this town 's a house of mirrors sometimes . It 's hard to know what you 're looking at .
STAGEHAND: They 're ready for you , Sheldon . Sheldon exits backstage .
SMOOCHY: Thank you . It 's good to be back . You know , kids , sometimes life in the jungle can be unfair . A place where nice guys do n't just finish last they get their heads cut off . Gasps from the bleachers .
SMOOCHY: So look around you , boys and girls . Every day . Be diligent ! Stand strong ! As the old prove says Beat a dog one time too many and you get a wolf ! Let 's start howling ! Howl for me , boys and girls !
RANDOLPH: Bad very bad too much fo ain pressure building ears inging eyes burning contempt overflowing
ANGELO: What are you doing ? ! That 's a Zenith ! Look at this place ! He grabs the lamp from Randolph .
RANDOLPH: Where am I supposed to go ?
ANGELO: I do n't care ! Out ! !
SHELDON: Easy , Spinner . Watch the ribs , uddy .
SPINNER: I missed you so much !
SHELDON: I missed you too , champ . He drops Sheldon and pulls out his cowbell .
SPINNER: I 've been practicing and practicing and I got real good , Sheldon . Real good !
SHELDON: Sure , why not .
BURKE: So you were saying you had some good news ?
SHELDON: Yes . Some very good news . Afte giving it a lot of thought I 've decided to do the ice show .
BURKE: Finally ! I got me a bar mitzvah oy . Today you are a man !
SHELDON: I realize now it 's a sin to waste your power .
BURKE: Like they say , rock bottom 's a college education .
SHELDON: But here 's the really good news I 'm doing it myself . No sponsors , no vendors , no crooks . Not one dirty hand will touch this . Not one person will make a dollar off these kids . Smoochy on Ice will e a study in purity . Burke 's grin suddenly fades .
BURKE: I 'm holding my breath .
SHELDON: All profits from ticket sales will e used to built a state-of-the- art methadone clinic in Coney Island . Burke looks pale .
BURKE: Sheldon , you ca n't do an ice show and cut out the vendors . And more importantly , you ca n't cut out the Parade of Hope . It 's suicide .
SHELDON: You always told me , when you 've got muscles you make the rules . Well , I 'm feeling pretty strong ight now . Sheldon rises and tosses his napkin down .
SHELDON: All this time I was letting the usiness use me . Well , I think it 's time I start using the business . I 've got my clout back and I 'm not gon na waste it this time . Take care of it , Burke .
TOMMY: Shel , you got ta help me out . He angs that goddamn thing from morning till night . I got a headache that goes from my eyes to my ass .
SHELDON: Whatever I can do , Tommy , just say it . You know I love Spinner . And I owe you .
TOMMY: Give the boy something else to do on the show . Anything . Just as long as it do n't clang , chime or honk .
CHICK: I do n't like complications , Frank . You got one week to get Takashi that slot or you 're gon na be shakin ' hands with Buddha .
STOKES: Do n't you understand ? My hands are tied . The rhino 's been exonerated . The show 's more popular than ever .
CHICK: Okay , boys , chop him up , bag him and dump him in the woods . Sambo and Tobi start to advance on Stokes .
STOKES: All right ! I 'll take care of it ! I just need time ! Chick leans into Stokes ' face .
CHICK: One week , Jeeves . Got that ? O I get a blender and make an Orange Julius with your feet . They exit .
MAN: Save the rhino ! Before it 's too late ! Make a donation ! Save the hino ! Hey , mister , ya wan na help save the rhino ?
RANDOLPH: I 'm the one who needs to be saved ! Me . I 'm broke ! I lost my lawyer ! My only friend kicked me out ! I 'm a fucking peanut shell in the shape of a man ! Save the Rainbow ! Save the Rainbow ! Save the Rainbow !
MAN: Help ! Someone call a cop !
STOKES: Your client is suffocating me . To make matters worse , he 's caused me to veer into a hazardous situation . A situation that otherwise could have a very happy ending .
BURKE: Tell me more about the Asians .
STOKES: They 're ruthless . Unwavering . Unprincipled . And best of all , they know how the game is played . They respect our delicate ecosystem of mutual benefit . Stokes stops walking and grabs Burke 's arm .
BURKE: The good old days .
STOKES: Pre-rhinoceros .
BURKE: This is very sticky ground we 're about to walk on .
STOKES: Well , you 're used to a little glue on your shoes . Burke smiles .
BURKE: Let me poke around . Sift through the possibilities .
MERV: This is what happens to guys who keep secrets , Johnny .
JOHNNY: I 'll give you the rest next week ! I promise !
MERV: It 's not me you 're fucking over , it 's sick kids . You got something against sick kids , Johnny ? The thug punches him in the stomach again .
JOHNNY: No ! I love sick kids !
MERV: And you tell that fat producer of yours , if he ever gives me a low head count again , he 'll lose the other thumb .
BURKE: Merv Green . How 's tricks , kid ?
MERV: Well , if it ai n't smilin ' Burke . Whose bones are you pickin ' today ?
BURKE: You got a minute , pally ?
MERV: No one freezes me out of an ice show . No one . I do n't care how many fucking clinics he 's trying to save .
BURKE: Look , I 'm chokin ' on the same bone as you .
MERV: If you 're trying to aggravate me , you 're doing a hell of a job .
BURKE: I 'm not here to aggravate , just educate . I think Mopes might be talking to people he should n't be talking to .
MERV: That 's an ugly string of words .
BURKE: He 's got it in his head that he 's gon na clean up the way we do usiness . Truthfully ? I would n't be surprised if he 's wearing a wire . Burke looks at his watch .
RANDOLPH: Attention , New Yorkers ! You are about to hear a shocking story of injustice !
RANDOLPH: I urge you to listen ! It has a surprise ending you wo n't want to miss ! A crowd starts to form on the sidewalk .
RANDOLPH: I 'm sorry to do this , people . Do n't try to talk me out of it .
SMOOCHY: Take it from me , Lester . Use you power . Do n't squander it build with it .
LESTER: Sound advice , Mr. Mopes . If I ever get any power I 'll give that a whirl . Hey , what 's going on up there ? Sheldon glances up from his paper .
SMOOCHY: Looks like a street performer of some sort . He goes back to his paper .
RANDOLPH: This is it , folks ! It 's showtime ! I 'm sorry to do this , but he 's left me no choice !
LITTLE GIRL: Whatcha doin ' , Rainbow Randolph ?
CROWD: Smoochy ! ! !
RANDOLPH: What does it all mean ? ? ! !
SPINNER: What do you mean I ca n't play the cowbell no more ?
SHELDON: You 're too talented for the cowbell , Spinner . Cowbells are for babies .
SPINNER: I ai n't no baby !
SHELDON: That 's right . You 're a fully grown man . With whiskers and scars the whole sha-bang . That 's why you deserve a bigge ole on the show . A more important role Spinner 's face starts to perk up .
KIDS: 'Stepdads are people too/ They have bad days , like we all do Be patient and help them through Stepdads are people too ' Smoochy continues the song .
SMOOCHY: 'So three cheers for the man that I proudly call Stan He 's not quite a dad or a brother Yes , he gets cross , but still he 's the boss And besides he takes care of my mother ! '
SMOOCHY: Howdy , Moochy ! Welcome to the Jungle ! You wan na say howdy to the kids ?
SPINNER: My name is Moochy .
SMOOCHY: That 's right . We 've established that .
SPINNER: Sheldon , this costume 's makin ' my nuts itch .
SHELDON: It 's fine , Spinner . We 'll edit it out . But tomorrow in rehearsal we 're gon na work on a new thing called 'the importance of hitting your mark . '
SPINNER: Great ! I get to hit something !
NORA: Hi .
SHELDON: Hi .
NORA: I read about the ice show .
SHELDON: Yeah , the papers seem to be really covering it .
NORA: I think it 's great . What you 're doing for that clinic .
SHELDON: Thanks . She nods .
NORA: I just need some clarification
SHELDON: Do n't worry . Spinner just needs a little more rehearsal . I 'll get him there .
NORA: No I mean about us . Sheldon looks uncomfortable .
SHELDON: I guess I 'm still readjusting a little . Like a guy who 's come ack from the war . Not that I 'd equate my misfortune with the ave men and women who protect us overseas .
NORA: I just thought we were on our way to something granted , my mistaken belief that you had ties to Neo-Nazis might have put a damper on our relationship , but I 'm sorry for
MERV: How could you hit the wrong hino ? !
HENRY: Who knew Smoochy had a cousin Moochy ? They look fucking identical .
MERV: Smoochy is bright orange , Moochy is burnt rust ! Read the papers ! Do I got ta take you back to fucking kindergarten ?
MITCH: All you said was 'hit the rhino . ' You never specified the color . I 'm not taking the blame for this one .
MERV: I 'm not through with you yet , hino ! Your time will fucking come !
SHELDON: It 's my fault . He 'd still be alive if it was n't for me . He would have been so proud to be in the ice show .
NORA: There was nothing you could have done . Do n't torture yourself .
SHELDON: I 'm sorry , Spinner . I 'm so sorry .
TOMMY: He really loved you , Shel . And this I guarantee that fucking Randolph has seen his last ainbow . We 're gon na find him , cut off his balls , and shove 'em up his ass .
SHELDON: Maybe you better leave it to the police .
DANNY: They wo n't do the ball thing . It 's against procedure .
TOMMY: Do n't forget that hit was meant for you , Shel . So from now on , everywhere you go , we go .
SHELDON: That 's okay , Tommy . I 'll be fine .
TOMMY: Fine , nothin ' . And as Christ is my witness , no one 's touchin ' a hair on your fuckin ' head . Spinner would have wanted it that way . Tommy 's crew nods and agrees .
TOMMY: Alright , boys , let 's get shit- faced . For Spin .
SHELDON: Did n't Rickets the Hippo have a song about death ?
NORA: 'The Last Nappy Time . ' It gave me a lot of comfort when my mothe died . 'When doggies stop barking And fish cease to swim And Grandpa lays silent , from his head to his limbs Sadness will find you But soon you 'll feel fine ' Sheldon joins in .
RANDOLPH: I did n't do it ! I know you 're still mad at me , but you got ta elieve me .
RANDOLPH: Mastermind ? I can barely figure out how to unzip my pants these days . Just taking a piss is a logistical nightmare .
ANGELO: It 's heatin ' up out there . Every cop in New York is looking fo you . And Tommy Cotter 's boys are combin ' the streets . You 're gon na have to stay put for a while .
RANDOLPH: I was an altar boy once . Did you know that ? I wanted to be a priest . Do you believe in angels , Angie ?
ANGELO: Angels ?
RANDOLPH: There was a little angel in pigtails . She was the only one who cared about me . She saved my life .
ANGELO: You did n't want to kill yourself , Randy . You know that .
RANDOLPH: Perhaps it 's time to heal . To accept the fact that Smoochy has won and gracefully march forward . True , I 'm currently wanted for a murder I did n't commit . But I have faith . Faith that justice will prevail .
ANGELO: Now you 're talkin ' , kid . This is a big step I 'm proud of you . He strokes Randolph 's head .
RANDOLPH: Did you bring lunch ?
ANGELO: Yes .
RANDOLPH: Chicken and stars ?
ANGELO: Just like you asked for .
RANDOLPH: Can I have some , please ?
ANGELO: For a smile .
ANGELO: Here , I got you some crossword puzzles and stuff to read .
RANDOLPH: Motherfucker ! ! ! ! ! ! !
TOMMY: Big news , Shel .
SHELDON: What 's that ?
TOMMY: It was n't Smiley who killed Spinner . It was Parade of Hope .
NORA: Merv Green ?
SHELDON: Are you sure ? The cops have tons of evidence on Randolph .
TOMMY: We did our own investigation . Cousin Ian from down at the morgue you met him at the wake
IAN: See the neck ? Snapped like a twig . Animals Parade of Hope 's calling card . When they do a guy , they like to sign the tab .
TOMMY: What 's that guy 's name over there ? Green ?
LEON: Yeah , Merv Green .
TOMMY: This was one time they shoulda left the tab blank .
NORA: I knew Merv Green was a scumbag from the day he grabbed my ass at a 'Feed the Children ' benefit .
SHELDON: Well , God help those guys now . They 're gon na get a first-class ide through the criminal justice system , and I 'm buying the tickets .
TOMMY: It 's all taken care of , Shel .
SHELDON: What does that mean ?
MERV: It was a mistake ! An honest mistake ! All I 'm trying to do is help children .
TOMMY: You like kids , huh ?
MERV: Yes ! Of course !
TOMMY: So you must know a few fairy tales . Danny , tell him the one about the worthless prick who gets his head chopped off .
SHELDON: Do we really need to hear this ? I do n't want to hear this .
JIMMY: A clean cut .
SHELDON: Okay , got it .
ROY: And then we took his head and
SHELDON: Thank you ! Specifics about his head are superfluous at this point .
NORA: Can I help you with something ?
CHICK: Yeah , honey , you can help us with something
NORA: I do n't know what you 're talking about and your cologne 's making me nauseous . Other than that , you 're great company . Chick looks at his boys and chuckles .
CHICK: Spicy little thing , is n't she ?
CHICK: Takashi gets that time slot . You hear me , girly ? Tell that boss of yours we 'll kill everyone at this fucking network if we have to . Starting with the pretty ones .
NORA: It 's Stokes . He 's behind the whole thing ! He cut some kind of deal for the Smoochy slot !
SHELDON: What are you talking about ?
NORA: He wants you out so he can put Takashi in !
SHELDON: Who 's Takashi ?
NORA: Jesus , Sheldon ! Do n't you eve pick up a copy of International Performer ? He 's the hottest kid show host from Asia .
RANDOLPH: Ah ! How very cozy . Like two logs in a little bonfire . All we need is a few sticks and some wienies .
SHELDON: Is this true ? Please tell me it 's just the confused ramblings of a diseased mind . She looks at him , but does n't say anything .
NORA: Listen , there was a time and I 'm not proud of this but there was a time when I was a bit of a kiddie-host groupie .
RANDOLPH: You 're just another action figure for her collection !
NORA: That 's not fair !
RANDOLPH: Tell him about Jingle Jackson !
SHELDON: You dated Jingle Jackson ?
RANDOLPH: The bells turned her on . Hey , tell him about Jumbo Johnny ! There 's a tale for ya ! A whale of a tale !
SHELDON: Oh good Lord in Heaven .
NORA: Look , what I did before I met you is none of your business .
RANDOLPH: Shut up ! Both of you ! This is my show !
SHELDON: I uh read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor . To that end , would you like to hear a funny joke ?
RANDOLPH: Oh , please . Go blow yourself , Martha . Fix me a beverage , woman . Make me one of those drinks that used to make us all warm and fuzzy before ouncy-bouncy time !
NORA: Fix it yourself , asshole .
RANDOLPH: Remember , I have Mr. Boomy .
SHELDON: I 'm telling you , you 'd love this joke . It revolves around Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny getting into a fender bender . Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar .
RANDOLPH: You know , when I lived here I used to have a big painting above the fireplace . A naked chick holding a pumpkin . It was very tasteful . No bush
NORA: Look , Randolph . We know it was n't you who killed Spinner .
SHELDON: We 'll go to the police , first thing tomorrow straighten everything out .

SHELDON: Is this what you want ? A Hansel and Gretel ending ? ! You want to e the big bad wolf ?
RANDOLPH: Stop ! It 's too hot ! The heat ! It 's driving me mad !
SHELDON: You 're not nothing . You 're itter , misguided and I 'm guessing a raging alcoholic , but you 're still Rainbow Randolph . Despite everything that 's happened , you once made children happy .
RANDOLPH: Would you be my friend ?
SHELDON: Sure .
RANDOLPH: You too ?
NORA: I guess .
RANDOLPH: Sorry about the brood mare stuff .
RANDOLPH: Thank you . She walks over to Sheldon .
NORA: What are you doing ? Sheldon continues to load the gun .
SHELDON: Just making the playing field even . I 'm tired of running this ace with one leg .
NORA: You 're letting them drag you down to their level .
RANDOLPH: She 's right , Sheldon . Do n't make the same mistakes I did . Keep your dignity intact .
SHELDON: I appreciate everyone 's concern , ut I can take care of myself . Nora and Randolph look at each other .
RANDOLPH: I tried .
SHELDON: Okay , buddy , we have to get down to the Garden . You 're welcome to stay here as long as you like . Just do n't leave until I get things squared away . Randolph gets up and walks over to him .
RANDOLPH: Be careful , Sheldon . Remembe what I told you you 've only scratched the surface of this scummy business . You have yet to strike oil .
RANDOLPH: You 're lucky to have a guy like Smoochy .
NORA: You just rest , Randolph .
RANDOLPH: He 's the real thing . Smoochy 's the eal thing . And I 've been a fraud . A wicked man doing wicked acts .
SHELDON: Well , we all have our bad days . He exits .
STOKES: Things are getting out of hand . We have to cover our tracks .
BURKE: Relax , everything 's gon na work out .
STOKES: Relax ? They found Merv Green 's head on the Grand Concourse ! Excuse my concern .
BURKE: Look , we can cover all the tracks we want , but in the end we still got the same problem . We got ta finish what we started .
STOKES: God help us Stokes shakily takes a sip of his drink .
BURKE: It 'll all be over tonight . Buggy 's gon na take care of everything .
STOKES: Buggy ? Buggy Ding-Dong ? The guy who hosted 'Buggy 's Bumpy Railroad ' ?
BURKE: Speak of the devil . Have a seat , Bug .
STOKES: Buggy . You 're looking good .
BURKE: It 's time we put this thing to est , Frank . And the way I see it the rhino 's up past his edtime .
RANDOLPH: Hellooo ! We GO TO a SPLIT-SCREEN with Angelo .
ANGELO: Randy , is that you ?
RANDOLPH: Yes , Angelo , my little Twinkie , should n't you be getting ready fo the big show ?
ANGELO: Listen , Buggy 's been here .
RANDOLPH: Buggy Double D 's ? The Dong Man ?
ANGELO: Yeah , he lifted my backstage pass and he 's braggin ' that he 's doing some kind of job for Burke Bennett .
RANDOLPH: Sheldon 's in trouble . I got ta get down to the Garden .
ANGELO: The place is crawling with cops . They 'll jump on you like a trampoline .
RANDOLPH: I do n't care . He rips the towel from his head .
SMOOCHY: On behalf of myself , the Rhinettes , and the soon to be estored Coney Island Methadone Center , I thank you all fo coming .
SMOOCHY: It was my original intention that tonight 's performance would be a enign mix of Smoochy songs and ice dancing . But as an artist , I elieve I must convey to you , my fans , what I 'm feeling at any given moment in my life . To do otherwise would be dishonest . Art is communication . It 's something we learn and hopefully grow from . With that in mind I hope you enjoy the show .
SHELDON: This is for Spinner .
MAN: It 's Rainbow Randolph ! Someone stop him !
RANDOLPH: Sheldon ! ! !
STOKES: What 's he doing here ? ! He 's going to screw everything up !
NORA: Sheldon ! ! !
BURKE: Nora
NORA: You 're in on this , are n't you ! You sold him out ! You fucking snake ! Stokes tries to put his arm around her .
STOKES: Nora , please . It 's not what you think . I 'm grooming you . You 're going to run the division one day
BURKE: Survival of the fittest !
NORA: Sheldon ! ! ! Get down ! ! !
RANDOLPH: Give me that gun , you fucking wacked-out freak !
COP #1: You okay ?
RANDOLPH: I do n't know . I 'm kind of fucked up in general , so it 's hard to gauge .
NORA: Burke 's with Stokes . He 's been in it all along .
BURKE: You fucking point a gun at me ? A gun I gave you as a gift ? ! Where 's your fucking etiquette ?
NORA: Let him go . Burke just looks at her .
BURKE: You know something , kid ? You 've turned out to be an incredible pain in the ass .
SHELDON: You were behind the Spinner hit , were n't you ?
BURKE: That was a tragic mistake . If only one could turn back time But what the hell , it 's just one less mick in the world . He laughs .
NORA: You son-of-a-bitch . Sheldon cocks the gun .
BURKE: Oh my . What are you gon na do ? Kill me ? That would n't be very Smoochy-like behavior .
SHELDON: You 're right . There 's just one thing
NORA: No , Sheldon .
SHELDON: Stay out of it , Tommy . This is my usiness . Tommy walks closer to Sheldon .
TOMMY: No more killin ' , Shel . Enough 's enough . Do n't destroy who you are for this piece of shit . You mean something to the kids . Do n't take Smoochy away from the kids .
SHELDON: I do n't know how I got pushed this far .
TOMMY: You 're only human , Shel . The important thing is you neve went over the cliff . You 're a good boy . For some of us it 's too late . Tommy pats Sheldon 's shoulder affectionately .
SHELDON: Tommy , you 're not going to
TOMMY: Do n't worry . Sometimes even a at deserves a little mercy .
NORA: Bus backfire . She pats him on the back .
STOKES: Get out of here !
CHICK: I wish I could tell you it 'll be quick and painless , Frank , but you know how these things go
SHELDON: You know , a little grime here and there does n't change the fact it 's still a beautiful city . He looks at Nora .
NORA: Let 's go home , Smoochy . Show 's over . Sheldon gazes back at her .
SHELDON: No it 's not . It 's just beginning .
STEPHAN: Breathe .

RACHEL: What 's this ? The jealous ex- husband or the intelligence officer ?

RACHEL: He did n't tell me anything . He did n't ! He told me where he 'd been travelling , that he 'd been teaching We spoke for a few minutes and then I had to go . Stephan is still staring at her , reading her .

STEPHAN: Jesus Christ !
DAVID: It 's not over .
STEPHEN: We could have fucking !

DAVID: We can do this . We just need to stay focussed .
VOGEL: ..Fucking assholes ! Fucking pig shit food ! Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Fuck

STEPHAN: You ca n't listen to him .
RACHEL: I know . I just
STEPHAN: I 'm not angry - He rubs her back . Rachel stiffens a little .
RACHEL: Good .
STEPHAN: Fuck !
VOGEL: Why do n't you just kill me now ? Rachel pauses for a moment .
VOGEL: I was dreaming about my wife . She feeds him some more .
DAVID: What happened ? What 's the matter ? She ca n't speak at first .

RACHEL: Why did n't you go ? At the station . You could have got away . Why did n't you ?
DAVID: Stephan ?
STEPHAN: It 's not happening .
DAVID: What the fuck does that mean ?
STEPHAN: The Americans have pulled out . Has he been fed ?
DAVID: Soso what does that mean ?

RACHEL: YES ! I fed him !
STEPHAN: There 's no plan . There 's no fucking plan . They said the operation is being `` re- evaluated . '' He turns to David .
RACHEL: They ca n't just leave us !
STEPHAN: Yes they can ! Because we fucked it all up ! We fucked it all up and now we 're on our own !
DAVID: Were you followed ? Stephan stares at the door , thrown .
RACHEL: Stephan ?
STEPHAN: If it 's them , he dies .
DAVID: You 're not doing this .
STEPHAN: He 's not getting away from me .
DAVID: This is n't the mission .
STEPHAN: I decide what the mission is ! If I say he dies , he dies .
DAVID: We 're finishing this mission . We 're taking him back .
STEPHAN: Get out of the way !
RACHEL: It was the lady from the bottom apartment . She invited us to he New Year 's Eve party .
DAVID: What are you doing ?
STEPHAN: It 's your shift .
DAVID: Did you know about this ?
RACHEL: About what ?
DAVID: His mouth 's taped . You want him to suffocate ?
STEPHAN: I was sick of seeing his face . Go ack in .
DAVID: Do n't do that again .
STEPHAN: You do n't give orders David . It 's your shift now so you can go back in there
RACHEL: Stop it ! They stop , breathing hard .
DAVID: We 're not animals . Just remembe what we are . Remember what we 're not .
RACHEL: I have to get out .
DAVID: Rachel
RACHEL: Get out of my way , please . I 'm just going to go out for a few minutes . That 's all I want to do .

RACHEL: GET OFF ME !
VOGEL: Thank you . David . David does n't react .
DAVID: Shut up .
VOGEL: I am expressing my sympathy . Fo your suffering .
DAVID: What does a monster like you know about suffering ?
VOGEL: I 'm a doctor , David . David stares at him .
DAVID: A doctor . You blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes . You inject people with petrol . Youyou eplace people 's hands and legs and you watch as they He stops himself .
VOGEL: So we were all insane ? Is that the answer ?
DAVID: There 's no answer . I 'm not looking for an answer . I 'm not looking for
VOGEL: You 're trembling .
STEPHAN: Out . We 're going out .
VOGEL: Thank you
STEPHAN: Nothing . Not a trace . Nothing at all .
DAVID: He 's not going back to the house . He 's gone . Fifteen years , it took them to find him . And he 's gone . And no-one 's going to find him again .
STEPHAN: So we what ? Weare you going to make the phone call ? Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl ? Wonderful . But do n't try and take me down with you . I 've done nothing wrong . Remember that ! Stephan kicks at the chair , at the drawers .
RACHEL: I take responsibility . It was my shift .
DAVID: This happened because of me . I let him go . And no-one 's eve going to find him again .
STEPHAN: No-one 's ever going to find him again .
RACHEL: What are you talking about ?
STEPHAN: Only four people know what happened in this room . Us , and him . And he 's not talking . No one will ever hear from him again .
RACHEL: No .
STEPHAN: Nobody needs to know what happened here .
RACHEL: He escaped .
STEPHAN: That 's the truth . But that does n't have to be the truth we take home . The truth can be anything we want it to be . The truth is Vogel tried to escape , you struggled with him and got hurt . The truth is , seconds efore he got away , Rachel got the gun and shot him . The truth is we got rid of him . got rid of the body got rid of every trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau .
RACHEL: We ca n't lie about this !
STEPHAN: No , you know what ? We have to . We have to ! This isthis is n't about us . This is about Israel . This is a national humiliation ! We ca n't be seen to fail . And in the end , Vogel rots away his life in some jungle , looking over his shoulder , waiting for the ullet ? Who 's to say ?
DAVID: He 's gone . What does it matter ? He 's gone .
STEPHAN: He 's right . It makes no difference . No difference . All we have to agree is that we neve talk about this . No matter what happens , we never tell anyone . The truth stays in this room . Between us . Agreed ?
DAVID: Agreed .
RACHEL: David ?
STEPHAN: Rachel ? Say it . It 's an oath . Say it .
RACHEL: How could this happen ? You said he would never speak ! You said he 'd never
STEPHAN: We do n't know it 's him .
RACHEL: Oh God ! Oh God !
STEPHAN: If you read it
RACHEL: He 's alive ! He 's in the Ukraine ! What else is there to read ?
STEPHAN: This is a little internet story . `` a psychiatric patient claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau '' Some crazy old man . No-one is paying this any attention . Yet .
RACHEL: How did you find it ?
STEPHAN: David comes back after all this time , I want to know why . I had his apartment searched . This was on his computer Rachel stares at him .
RACHEL: No ! Beat .
STEPHAN: Because he could n't handle it . I told him we had to deal with it and he could n't handle it . He thought it was all going to come out and he panicked
RACHEL: Deal with it ? What does that mean ? Deal with it ? Stephan stares at her .
STEPHAN: I told him to find Vogel . I told him to finish it .
RACHEL: Did you know he 'd been ill ? Did you ? You knew , did n't you ? You killed him . YOU killed him ! You knew he was n't strong enough
STEPHAN: FUCK DAVID ! I do n't want to hea about David ! David took the coward 's way out !
RACHEL: You could have left it alone ! It 's an old man in a hospital ! You said - nobody will believe it ! No-one will notice !
STEPHAN: There 's a journalist . This stops her .
RACHEL: What are you talking about ?
STEPHAN: David 's taken himself out of the equation . I ca n't do it . You 're the only one left .
RACHEL: Are you insane ?
STEPHAN: We ca n't
RACHEL: I 'm notLook at me ! I 'm not capable ofThis is insane . I ca n't do this .
STEPHAN: You have to , Rachel . Because fo thirty years you 've been taking the credit for it . And there 's Sarah . It 's as if he 's struck her . Beat .
RACHEL: I wo n't do this . She walks out .
STEPHAN: I thought I 'd already been punished .
RACHEL: God does n't plant car bombs .
STEPHAN: I was n't referring to the wheelchair . They look at each other .
RACHEL: She is n't going to find out .
STEPHAN: My car 's waiting outside . It can take you to the airport .
RACHEL: How can I ? How can I ? She turns and walks away .
WAITER: What can I get you ?
RACHEL: Just a coffee .
SOLDIER: The same question to Mr. Peretz .
STEPHAN: Fuck him . He examines his reflection in the mirror .
RACHEL: Go to bed , Sarah .
RACHEL: Am I late ? I 'm sorry . Can I place an advertisement ?
RECEPTIONIST: 100 grivna for twenty words . 5 grivna a word after that . Rachel proffers an envelope .

JONATHAN: Do-you have tomorrow 's Times yet ?
OLD MAN: It is tomorrow .
JONATHAN: Right . I forgot .
OLD MAN: Anything else ?
JONATHAN: Uh - no . No that 's it , thanks .
SOLANGE: So early , Jonathan . We open in one hour .
GRINS: So tell me , you have been out with a lady friend , oui ?
SMILES: Je suis desole , madame , mais no .
SOLANGE: But why else does a young man come home at such an hour ?
JONATHAN: Just working late , that 's all .
SOLANGE: Every night working late , working late . Ah , you ca n't fool me . You are Miste Mischief maker - I know this ! You come by
LAWYER 1: So , the Knicks win last night ?
LAWYER 2: I 'm pretty sure , yeah .
JONATHAN: Actually , they lost by 4 .
LAWYER 1: Oh . Hey , so . did you get a chance to look ove that memo from Watkins ?
JONATHAN: Yes ?
JONATHAN: Maybe they 're developing a fly with a nursing degree . A superfly .
LAUGHS: Who 's in there anyway ?
JONATHAN: Uh , Jonathan Messer .
WYATT: Sorry if I scared you . I was heading home and saw the lights . We met before , in the can
JONATHAN: Sure . It 's Wyatt , right ?
WYATT: So do you normally work this late ?
JONATHAN: Pretty much . I 'm supposed to be out of here by tomorrow so I 'm just trying to finish up . What about you ?
WYATT: You kidding ? This is an early night . Hard to believe that once upona time a man 's success was measured by how little he had to work . You know in Sweden the average worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation ? Do-you like accounting ?
JONATHAN: It 's all right , if you enjoy working with numbers . Do you like being a lawyer ?
WYATT: It 's all right . If you enjoy working with assholes .
JONATHAN: No - it 's okay . Really .
WYATT: So Worth and Berman , huh ? Do n't you have to like be in Mensa to work there ? Jonathan smiles , shrugs modestly .
JONATHAN: Since my senior year of college . They subsidized my graduate degree .
WYATT: Really . So you were poor ?
JONATHAN: Well - I guess you could say that . I was aised by a single mother , and she died when I was nineteen , so yeah . It was n't so bad though . I 'm sure a lot of people have had it worse .
WYATT: Not around here . Practically every suit I know is Harvard by way of Andover .
JONATHAN: Are you ?
WYATT: Me ? Hell no I 'm Princeton . By way of Exeter .
GRINS: What do you say to a break ?
STONED: .It 's just sometimes I feel so - I do n't know - removed . I mean , I work for one of the biggest accounting firms in the world , and.there 's not so much as a desk there to prove it ? They 've decided all we need are cell phones and laptops . Messages are voice-mailed , documents e-mailed , salary 's deposited online . Chet Peterson , my senio manager ? I swear he would n't recognize me if I was sitting in his chair .
JONATHAN: I do n't know I used to have friends . But it 's like I 've spent so much time trying to prove myself , working these
EXHALES: I guess I just never counted-on the isolation . It 's like sometimes I look through that glass , and I see life literally passing me by .
WYATT: Jonathan ?
JONATHAN: Yeah ?
WYATT: By the clock on the wall there ? You 've
JONATHAN: I guess that 's it . then . Nice meeting you .
ASSISTANT CONTROLLER: Uh huh .
JONATHAN: Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt Bose 's office ?
WYATT: Leaving , huh ? So where to next ?
JONATHAN: Clancey Funds on Thursday . Clute Nichols after that .
WYATT: Hey , wait up a sec . Well , good meeting you , Jonathan .
WYATT: Commiserations , Messer . Good game .
WARMLY: Develop akiller instinct and you 'll beat the crap out of me .
WYATT: They asked if we 'd fancy a post-game cocktail . Do n't worry , I got us out of it . Jonathan is barely able to speak .
JONATHAN: Oh ? I would 've been happy to .
WYATT: Are you kidding ? They 're a couple of first years at Merrill . Screw that , we can do etter . Hey , you OK ?
JONATHAN: Actually , it 's a hybrid weave natural gut and Kevlar . They 're pretty obscure now . I should replace them , they 're all frayed
WYATT: Have you ever considered contacts ?
JONATHAN: Huh ? Oh - yeah , I tried once , but I was allergic to something in the solution .
WYATT: Too bad . You have an attractive face . You eyes especially . Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel .
JONATHAN: What - you mean sex ?
WYATT: No , flood insurance . How many women have you slept with ?
JONATHAN: Oh , I do n't know , not a whole-
WYATT: Of course you know . Everyone knows .
JONATHAN: Maybe - four .
WYATT: Maybe four ?
JONATHAN: Okay fine , just four . What about you ?
WYATT: Me ? I have no idea .
JONATHAN: What ? You just said everyone -
WYATT: I meant everyone like you .
JONATHAN: We have the same phone .
WYATT: Oh - and you thought I was using yours ? I can afford my own phone calls , you know .
WYATT: I 'm pulling your dick , Jonathan . Actually , I was just firming up some plans for tonight . Are you free ?
WYATT: You 're not . What do you say , are you in ?
JONATHAN: I guess I could go home and change .
WYATT: To Brooklyn ? Forget it , you can borrow something of mine .
WYATT: Here , try this one . What ?
JONATHAN: Nothing , I just hope I can pull it off .
WYATT: You hope you can pull it off . You know who you remind me of ? James Getz .
JONATHAN: Who ?
WYATT: A guy I roomed with freshman year at
JONATHAN: What lie ?
WYATT: That he was any different . The clothes , the money , the wry anecdotes - it 's all one big masquerade . Anyone can get in , you 've just got to wear a costume . But Getz never got that . He assumed he could never scale the wall , when the truth is he was the only one guarding it . It neve occurred to him his anonymity could be an asset . No one gets over like the guy who 's just a face , an impression . We are - all
JONATHAN: So what happened to him ?
WYATT: Who , James Getz ? Oh - he killed himself .
JONATHAN: You 're pulling my dick , are n't you .
WYATT: With both hands .
EMCEE: And now , straight from the Cafe Germaine , the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour !
WYATT: It 's a little self-conscious , but I thought you 'd get a kick out of it . How 's that suit working out ?
JONATHAN: Oh - great , actually .
WYATT: Keep it then . I 've got two just like it .
WAITRESS: Two Macallan 25 year . Enjoy , gentlemen .
JONATHAN: Is n't this like fifty bucks a glass ?
WYATT: We 'll try not to spill any . So what 's the wildest thing you 've eve done ? Sexually , I mean .
JONATHAN: The wildest thing ? Oh I do n't know , I 've never been too adventuresome .
WYATT: All right , what 's the lamest thing then ?
JONATHAN: The lamest
WYATT: And you called it ? So what happened ?
JONATHAN: Nothing actually . The phone just kept inging . And that 's it .
WYATT: You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine . That is beyond lame .
JONATHAN: .Hello ?
WYATT: That depends on what you mean by that word . Stretch the definition and you could incorporate most of the men as well . You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only elong to a union , they have to pay taxes .
JONATHAN: You seem to possess quite a store of international trivia .
WYATT: Not really . I just get around Jonathan , elax . It 's not like she just shot you dog . I was only trying to help . Besides , what are you looking for - a relationship ? As if you have time for one ? This was you first day off in how long ?
JONATHAN: Three weeks .
WYATT: Four for me . Face it , we 've mortgaged ou youth . Pimped out our twenties . But we still have needs . And there 's nothing shameful about wanting them met .
JONATHAN: So you sleep with hookers ?
LAUGHING: Me ? Never .
JONATHAN: So how do you - meet your needs ?
WYATT: What if I told you Christ , I sound like an infommercial .
JONATHAN: What were you going to say ?
WYATT: Listen . You do n't think that women have these same urges ? Young women , just like ourselves , successful and working thei asses off to stay that way ? You bette elieve they do .
JONATHAN: And ?
WYATT: And - well - let 's just say , there 's a waya way it can be taken care of .
JONATHAN: You make it sound like a mob hit .
WYATT: Some other time .
SURPRISED: Oh okay .
WYATT: Hey . You had a good time tonight ?
JONATHAN: Yeah . Yeah I did . Thanks .
WYATT: I 'm glad . Listen , that thing with the
JONATHAN: Forget it . It was funny .
WYATT: I 'll give you a call tomorrow .
JONATHAN: Hey . Could you let me out at the next corner over there , on 7th Avenue ?
CLANCEY CONTROLLER: Any problems , you 'll want to see Julie
JONATHAN: Right.I just need the access codes fo the accounts and sub-accounts ? The Controller suddenly looks uneasy .
CLANCEY CONTROLLER: What ?
JONATHAN: Nothing , I was just pulling your leg . I do need those codes though , when you get a chance .
WYATT: I wonder what the Founding Fathers would make of this scene .
JONATHAN: I 'm just glad to be outside . I 've got to tell you , this has been great , meeting up for lunch . I used to just-
WYATT: Yes ? Shit . Okay , see if you can.gettme
JONATHAN: No - no you did n't .
WYATT: Yeah , I should be gone a few weeks .
JONATHAN: Sounds exciting .
WYATT: Nah , it 'll be boring as sin .
WYATT: Shit , I 'd better get back . You ready ?
JONATHAN: Jonathan Mess-
SECRETARY 1: .That 's just it . You caught him in a lie , so now everything he says you have to-
JONATHAN: Hello ?
JONATHAN: Hello ? The CRACKLE OF STATIC on the other end . Then
JONATHAN: Hi , it 's Jonathan , I 've got your cell ! I guess you must have mine . I imagine you 're in the air now , but call when you get this . if you do . Oh , and you got a call from someone who I'mforget it , just call me . Jonathan hangs up .

JONATHAN: I 've lived here all my life !
CABBIE: No offence , pal .
THE BLONDE: Are you waiting for me ?
THE BLONDE: Excuse me ? I 'm sorry , did we speak earlier ?
JONATHAN: Yes . Yes we did -
THE BLONDE: Good . Let 's go then .
JONATHAN: Look , I do n't think I 'm I mean ; you and I. , we do n't know each other ?
THE BLONDE: No fooling .
JONATHAN: What I mean to say is , I 'm fairly certain there 's been some kind of mistake .
THE BLONDE: You 're not who I spoke with on the phone ?
JONATHAN: No - I mean , yes , but -
THE BLONDE: You 're not attracted to me ?
THE BLONDE: It 's just what exactly ?
DESK CLERK: Sir , I 'm showing that room as having
JONATHAN: Well could you tell me the name of the guest who was staying there ?
DESK CLERK: I 'm afraid we 're not allowed to disclose information regarding our guests . If you give me her name , I can confirm if she was egistered here .
JONATHAN: Actually , the thing is it 's okay . Forget it .
WYATT'S VOICE: Hey , you 're up early !

BRITISH ACCENT: Frankly I 'm surprised that whoever gave you access did n't explain more .
SIGHS: Right then , the rules One , .no names , no
BRITISH ACCENT: The initiator is responsible for the room .
JONATHAN: Oh - so I should ?
BRITISH ACCENT: Precisely .
JONATHAN: So are there a lot of - people - who do this ?
BRITISH ACCENT: How did you get into this ?
JONATHAN: Well , a friend of mine -
BRITISH ACCENT: He uploaded your numbers but failed to explain the basics ?
BRITISH ACCENT: It 's not that , it 's just well , you strike me as something of a stowaway . In fact if I were more suspicious , I 'd say you did n't belong here at all .
JONATHAN: Can I ask you something ? Why do you do this ?
BRITISH ACCENT: Why are any of us doing this ? For the economics of the arrangement . It 's intimacy without intricacy . Jonathan 's about to reply
JONATHAN: Well - good night .
JONATHAN: Hey , I never heard back from you . I guess you 're busy.with stuff over there . I 've been kinda busy too ! I 've been wondering - did you mean for me to take your phone ?

JONATHAN: It 's just that-
"S,1: Hmm , it is kind of a gear-shift . She starts to button her blouse back up .
JONATHAN: Wait - do n't go . She glances back curiously .
JONATHAN: Hmrnwhat do we know of her ? She sports a camel coat , a briefcase and possesses no umbrella . I deduceher name is 'Sybil ' . 'S ' laughs .
W7: Neither .
JONATHAN: How about Syd ? As in Syd Charisse ? She was Cyd with a ' C ' !

JONATHAN: Give me a goddamn break .
TELLER: Sir , there 's no need for profanity .
JONATHAN: Oh no ? In the last few days I 've seen a woman I thought might be dead turn up alive and a woman I assumed was alive turn up dead , both at the hands of a guy about whom everything I know is apparently a lie . I 've had my building set on fire , my neighbor nearly killed , and my apartment ansacked . So please forgive my language , ut it 's been one fuck of a week .
TELLER: I 'm showing that card as having been sent out four days ago . It definitely went out . We even heeded the change of address equest .
TELLER: Apparently you informed the bank of an address change ? She swivels her monitor so he can see .
WYATT: Long time no see .
WYATT: I have some instructions . Follow them and I might let her live .
JONATHAN: Where is she ?
WYATT: This should 've been simpler . I frame you , you panic
JONATHAN: Where is she ? ! A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts
WYATT: Press pause on the questions and listen . The brokerage firm you 're auditing is Clute Nichols . As a standard part of that audit you 're temporarily privy to all client accounts as well as access codes
WYATT: I know you do n't . But I do . Your passport . Now , please .
JONATHAN: It wo n't work - they screen for stuff like this . It 'll be discovered eventually .
WYATT: I can live with eventually . I always have .
WYATT: You answered the ad , Jonathan . `` Feeling all alone out there ? Have a great job , fine personality and good looks to match , but no time to.meet that special someone ? Help is just a phone call away - ''
JONATHAN: The ad - in Money magazine
GRINS: Told you to block that Caller ID . Of course I had to scope out a whole lot of losers before I hit the jackpot . Afte all , there only so many Jonathan Messers out there .
BEAT: If you screw with me , well - you saw what I did to that Blonde ? That 's kindness compared to what I 'll do to your little .girlfriend . You wo n't even recognize he when I 'm through .
JONATHAN: Why should I believe you ? Everything you told me was lies .
WYATT: Not lies , Jonathan . Foreplay . And now now you 're fucked .
WYATT: Remember be smart . I 'll be watching you . And feel free to take a shower , looks like you could do with one .
ASSISTANT: Mr. Peterson , one of the audit managers is here to see you . Jonathan Messer ?
PUZZLED: Really ? Well - okay , bring him back .
PETERSON: Jonathan , good to see you again !
YOUNG MAN: Actually , I was just looking for Fred Whipple 's office ?
AWKWARDLY: Next door down .
PETERSON: Jonathan , good to see you again !
CONCERNED: You 'll stay on to finish up at Clute Nichols , of course ?
WYATT: Absolutely .
PETERSON: So do you have any plans ?
WYATT: Yes . I 'm going to travel . I want to see the world . Peterson nods benignly .
JONATHAN: I wondered if you were monitoring this .
BEAT: Are you free tonight ?
JONATHAN: Where is she ?
WYATT: In one of the rooms . Safe . I got us a table .
WAITRESS: Two Macallan 25 year . Enjoy . The Waitress leaves . Wyatt raises his glass .
WYATT: To friendship . Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt .
JONATHAN: Bansky 's dead , is n't he ?
WYATT: He was dead when I met him . Just like you . The rest was a mere formality . Of course he did n't have your bargaining chip . Speaking of which
JONATHAN: Not until I see her . She 's the only reason I 'm here and not at the police .
WYATT: I told you , she 's in a room . Alive .
JONATHAN: Give me the key then .
WYATT: As soon as you 're done , I 'll tell you the oom number .
JONATHAN: Not good enough .
WYATT: Hey , I like you , okay ? You 'll be fine .
JONATHAN: You like me .
WYATT: I do , Jonathan . In my way . After all , you 're my creation . I 'm the one who gave you life .
JONATHAN: Do n't you get it ? It was her , not you ! She 's the one . She gave me life ! You can steal my identity , but not what 's here .
WYATT: Yeah , well , I 'm weeping big wet ones fo you both . Now , let 's get on with it .
BEAT: I do n't have all night , Jonathan .
WYATT: What is it ?
JONATHAN: My wireless modem - I must have left it in the conference room . I ca n't get back online . Wyatt glares at Jonathan , seething .
WYATT: You stupid fuck .
JONATHAN: I can go back there and-
WYATT: No . Get up .
JONATHAN: They do n't let you use your own computer .
WYATT: They will now . Jonathan takes the hundred , and heads into
EMPLOYEE: You forgot your . own room number ?
JONATHAN: I just checked in and it 's been a hectic day . Look at me !
EMPLOYEE: You could just ask at the front desk . I 'm sure they can-
JONATHAN: I really do n't have time , okay ?
AUBURN HAIR: Pardon me , but may I ask you something - personal ?
EMPLOYEE: Room 907 .
WYATT: What the hell are you
JONATHAN: Fire , I know - I 'll be out in a minute .
JONATHAN: What do you say we stick together from now on ?
JA S": I 'd like that .
JONATHAN: He 's down there ! I saw him -
11 SIP: Oh God -
JONATHAN: Up - we 've got to go up !
JONATHAN: Come on !
WYATT: Nice try back there , Jonathan . Looks like you picked up a thing or two from me .
GASPING: They 'll catch you
WYATT: Me ? No - no , I 'm just a face in the crowd . I 'm a tourist , just passing through .
JONATHAN: Yours , I believe .
01S.11: Thanks , Frank .
JONATHAN: Can I ask you something personal ? She nods .
JONATHAN: What 's your name ?
JONATHAN: Yes . I 'm free . They gaze at each other .
JOE STEVENS: Your mother okay ?
STORE OWNER: Fuckin ' niggers fuckin ' niggers
CARVER: Officer Leland ? You know the difference between a black man and nigger ?
WINSTON: Who the fuck do you think you 're talking to ?
CARVER: Thanks for coming in .
STEVENS: The nigger 's the one who falls fo your bullshit .
CARVER: Gerald Carver , United States District Attorney . Call me Gerry .
STEVENS: He ought to be wearing a sign .
CARVER: You can tell he 's a cop ? Stevens laughs it 's obvious .
STEVENS: He keeps looking for his back-up . Now , the other guy knows it , too .
CARVER: Then why 's he taking him to the room ?
STEVENS: To rip him off .
TAFT: Oh , Bobby Jesus , Jesus Get an ambulance and back up . Now !
STEVENS: Who is he ?
CARVER: Charles Taft . LAPD Narcotics .
STEVENS: He 's a good cop .
CARVER: He 's a great cop . Two and a . As tough as they come and twice as honest .
STEVENS: But the cops are n't getting it done here , are they ? Got ta try something new
CARVER: You are . If you want to be . Most undercover guys do n't know what they 're doing because it 's a day gig . I need somebody who goes under and stays there ; six months , a year , five years
STEVENS: What does he have to do ?
CARVER: Buy drugs . Sell drugs . Feed me information .
STEVENS: He 's a snitch .
CARVER: He 's a drug dealer . A criminal . A scumbag . But for the right side . I want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent . Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here . And you 'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher .
STEVENS: I ca n't do that . I 've got a wife and kids .
CARVER: You 're separated from your wife , she 's filled for divorce . You see your kids every other weekend .
STEVENS: All my life I 've stayed away from that stuff . I 've never touched drugs .
CARVER: Come on , a little grass ?
STEVENS: Not grass . Not nothing . I never even had a drink . Never have , never will . You do n't understand . I made a choice in my life .
CARVER: What 's to understand ? You saw you father killed when you were ten , and you decided you would n't be like that . I 'm God , I know everything . You wanted to be a good boy , so you became a cop . Hiding out in uniform That 's why you got the hard-on for Taft .
STEVENS: It 's not that simple .
CARVER: I 'll tell the truth , Joe . You 're never going to be a Taft .
STEVENS: I do n't believe that . But he does .
CARVER: You ever take a look at you psychological profile ? You score almost like a criminal . `` Resents authority ''
STEVENS: I do not .
CARVER: `` Exaggerated moral standards , but with no underlying value system . '' Look at the anger , the repressed violence , it 's almost off the scale
STEVENS: Let me see that
CARVER: Why 'd you join the force ?
STEVENS: I wanted to be of use .
CARVER: Well , now you can be . You wo n't be Taft , but maybe you 'll be something more interesting . There 's a man named Ramon Gallegos who supplies 60 % of the cocaine to the West Coast . He 's smart , smooth , and sufficiently elusive that we do n't even have an adult photograph of him . However , his uncle is Hecto Guzman , an important Latin American political figure . Gallegos uses Uncle 's connections to get product into the country , and everyone we 've sent after him has ended up like that Indicates dead body on TV .
STEVENS: Why would I be different ?
CARVER: You already are , that 's the point You 've got the ability and the personality to go underground and lend in completely . That 's what the others could n't . Some part of them showed . That 's why they 're dead . See , there 's only one rule in this game . Stevens raises his eyebrows what ?
STEVENS: Joe-J , Carmen
TERRY: Lay off it . They 're just kids
TITO: Hey , Joe .
STEVENS: Tito
CARMEN: Daddy ! It 's a bunny She puts her arms around him .
STEVENS: It 's my work . I 've got to .
CARMEN: Tito did it .
STEVENS: He hit you ? ! God damn it , what 's he doing touching her ? I 'm gon na
TERRY: She was running behind his chai when he got up . It was an accident . A complete total accident .
BLONDE WOMAN: Television mostly . I was on `` Sky King '' twice , `` Ramar of the Jungle . '' That was a silly show . The jungle was mostly flats

CARVER: Get to Elias . Then to Barbosa .

CARVER: Rush it , please . I want art , John , not reality . Budget hearings start in April , and I need Gallegos by then . They wo n't give us funding fo three ounce buys .
HULL: We 're not just doing this for the funding , are we ?
CARVER: Without funding , we are n't doing it at all .

BELINDA: Or you could just give me a part now
BLONDE WOMAN: No solicitin ' in the halls . I told you that before .
BELINDA: I ai n't doin ' shit . Bitch
AMPLIFIED VOICE: This is the police . Remain inside the vehicle . Place your open hands against the windshield so that they are clearly visible
HULL: Christ

TAFT: Thank you kindly

TAFT: Do n't jive me , boy .
HULL: The nigger 's the one covers Whitey 's ass by puttin ' the brothers in jail .
TAFT: You ai n't my brother .
PUBLIC DEFENDER: Hi , I 'm Shelley Weissbrod . This is only an arraignment , a preliminary hearing , but if you do n't have money for an attorney , the Public Defender 's office can

GOPHER: Tell the truth , Eddie . Be honorable . It 's all you got left .

BARBOSA: You should kill a man some day , David , it 's liberating Summer camp . I 'm in business with somebody who went to summer camp . Everyone else is silent , grave .
ELIAS: Eddie , man He was always nice to my daughter .
HULL: How 'd a guy like you get into this ?
ELIAS: The way most drug lawyers do clients paid me in product , and I had to move it . Soon I was doing more dealing than law . But this was '83 , '84 , there was so much money we thought it would never end .
HULL: Yeah . And now ?
ELIAS: The road gets rougher . Cocaine 's a dying business .
HULL: Then what are we doing here ?
ELIAS: People are always going to want to get high . Every society has ways to alter consciousness .
HULL: Because they ca n't bear reality .
ELIAS: We all need our delusions , only the means change psychedelics , opiates , prayer , orgies , human sacrifice
HULL: What 's next ? Elias puts a finger to his lips .
ELIAS: I know how to make it and market it . But I need capital . That 's the only eason I 'm hanging out with an asshole like Barbosa . And because I ca n't get to the big guys .
HULL: Who are the big guys ?
ELIAS: Gallegos , et cetera .

ELIAS: That 's my friend , John . This is Miranda .
HULL: Hi , Miranda .

ELIAS: Nancy , this is John .
HULL: That 's more than I bought .
ELIAS: Half we owe you . The other half 's on consignment . A token of our esteem .
HULL: You 're having trouble moving it . Elias does n't deny it .
ELIAS: I do n't need a partner . I need a salesman .
CARVER: I ca n't buy this much shit . I have n't got it in the budget .
HULL: What am I supposed to do with it ?
CARVER: You 're a drug dealer , John . Deal drugs . Hull just looks at him . Carver does n't blink .
HULL: You know how this goes , Gerry . It wo n't stop here . You know what they 're going to ask me to do pretty soon , to prove I 'm down . What am I supposed to do then ?
CARVER: Do n't blow your Carver .
HULL: You ca n't back down with them . You 've got to project strength , from inside , you know ? The Dealer nods . Across the street Hull sees
DEALER: What 'd you do that for ?
HULL: 'Cause I can , motherfucker , 'cause I can .
ELIAS: Jacqueline , ho-ney
HULL: 'Cause you 're a racist asshole . You feel like you 're fucking a slave , and it gets you off .
ELIAS: Oh , do n't mau mau me with the Malcolm X shit . Tell me you 're not chasin ' white pussy every chance you get .
HULL: I do n't dig white women . Even if I did , it would n't mean the same thing .
ELIAS: Sure , it 'd be the slave fucking the master . Hegel talks about it . Just like me , but the other way around .
HULL: Fuck Hegel . Who the fuck is Hegel ? Some smart-ass kike that talks ackwards ?
ELIAS: Everybody digs the other , John . They dig their own , and they dig the other .
HULL: Does your wife dig black guys , David ? Did she fuck Eddie ? Does she want to fuck me ?
ELIAS: Ooo you mean with that great big purple dick of yours ? I hope not . She 'd never be impressed with my little thing again .
HULL: You think what impresses her now is your dick ?
ELIAS: What does impress her ? Hull ca n't help laughing . He starts the car .
MCCUTCHEON: Your new Eddie . I hear the old one wore out .
ELIAS: Factory recall . John 's going to be a good customer . He does a lot of wash .
HULL: So how 's this place work ?
ELIAS: Betty wires the money to a store in Aruba in payment for things they never sent her . They deposit the money in a bank there that turns around and loans her money she neve has to repay . That way it does n't turn up as income for the IRS . Welcome to the laundromat .
MCCUTCHEON: David , you talk too much .
ELIAS: She does n't trust you .
HULL: How much is this ?
MCCUTCHEON: More than you can afford .
HULL: I 'll take it .
ELIAS: By all means . She draws out six lines . Elias does two .
MCCUTCHEON: Come on , Eddie 2 you 're up .
HULL: No , thanks .
MCCUTCHEON: Who is he , my mother ?
HULL: Never have , never will . Betty ignores him , does her lines .
MCCUTCHEON: Oooh Cocaine , I love it and I hate it and I love it . The disease is the cure .
ELIAS: John 's an ascetic Negro ; he wants to make sure you know he 's not a jungle unny .
HULL: Watch your mouth , David .
ELIAS: But he 's got another side . You should seen him on the street the other day with these two USC kids . Do the spade it for her , John . I 'm gon na mess you up , muthafugga
HULL: Do n't call me a spade . And do n't tell me to play black . He says it gently , but Betty hears the edge .
ELIAS: Come on , John , you do it so well . Ah ai n't playin ' , muthafucka . Ah ai n't playin ' . Hull glares ; Elias refuses to be intimidated .
HULL: Say it again , and I 'll kill you .
MCCUTCHEON: Grow up , assholes !
DEALER: The guy ripped me off , man , so I do n't got the money , I do n't got the stuff and
HULL: You got ta pay anyway .
DEALER: Oh , but , man
HULL: Shit
ELIAS: It was n't your fault . What could you have done ?
HULL: She worked for me . I 'm supposed to protect her .
ELIAS: We have to kill him . Hull looks up .
HULL: That guy who works for Barbosa can do it , Chino .
ELIAS: No . If we use Chino , it 's Barbosa who 's asserting . It 'll be Barbosa 's territory . It 's got ta be us .
HULL: Right .
ELIAS: And if it 's us , it 's got ta be you .
HULL: Do n't blow your cover .
ELIAS: What ?
HULL: If I do this , we 're partners . Equal partners on everything .
ELIAS: Now ? But Hull is already moving .
HULL: Go wait around back . Elias nods . A beat . They look at each other .
ELIAS: I want to see you in that alley .
IVY: What 're you looking at ?
HULL: Carmen , it 's me . It 's Daddy
CARMEN: Daddy ! !
VOICE: The maze leads in two directions . At one end the rat can obtain a food pellet . At the other it receives electrical stimulus to a very specific area of the cerebellum
CAL TECH: This is an addictive amphetamine with time-space distortion , delusions of grandeur or maybe they 're real tending to be impulsive , sometimes violent behavior . Psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism . It 's illegal , and you can buy it on any street corner .
ELIAS: Randy 's a genius . His professor told him he could win the Nobel prize .
CAL TECH: Nobel prizes are for wussies .
HULL: What does this shit do to you ?
CAL TECH: I 'm on it now . It 's like cocaine only better . Want some ?
HULL: I do n't take drugs .
CAL TECH: Your mistake . This is designed fo the top end of the market . For people who want to master reality , not avoid it . Because it 's synthetic , you do n't grow it , refine it , or best of all import it .
ELIAS: What would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity ?
CAL TECH: With a million dollars , I could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop . But then with five million , or bette yet ten , the cost would drop to thirty cents , and we 'd have enough for the whole world .
ELIAS: I 'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account . You cheat me , Randy , I 'll use you ladder for a bagpipe . We 're going to put Barbosa out of usiness . Elias is very happy . He leads Hull out .
CARVER: Synthetic shit ? ? Sounds like a 20/20 segment
HULL: What was what like ?
CARVER: Popping Ivy
HULL: You knew .
CARVER: I 'm God , remember ?
HULL: Then you should know how it was .
CARVER: You did n't clear it with me . You 're getting independent . That 's good . Hull smiles .
HULL: He supplies Barbosa . To get to him we 'll have to take quantity .

HULL: More .

GOPHER: They 're already wondering .
BARBOSA: You can have Gopher .
GOPHER: Oh Gawd
BARBOSA: How about a lawyer ?
GOPHER: Felix , do n't do this .

CARVER: My problem ? My problem is that you do n't really know what 's happening .
HULL: Oh , so , tell me what 's happening , Gerry .

HULL: David , not now .
ELIAS: Yes , now !
TAFT: Who are you , man ? Who the fuck are you ?
HERNANDEZ: I 'm me .
ELIAS: He traded us to the cops . Just like Eddie . Eddie , who was nice to my daughter , had to die because that 's the rule . And you were vulgar about my wife , Felix , so at the very least the same rule applies to you .

MCCUTCHEON: About what ?
ELIAS: He said I should kill a man . He was ight .
MCCUTCHEON: My God .
ELIAS: Barbosa was a roach . Do you miss him ? Will anybody in the world miss him ?
MCCUTCHEON: Are you a roach , too ?
ELIAS: Yes . Thank God .
MCCUTCHEON: What about you ? He 's silent , keeps driving . She 's had enough .
ELIAS: She knows too much . We have to kill her .
HULL: No ! She 's with me . She 's not going to talk . You touch her , I 'll kill you .
ELIAS: She 's your responsibility then . Hull accepts it .
HULL: They 're going to come after us .
ELIAS: It 's a hardball game . We 're hardball players .
HERNANDEZ: It was n't my fault .
MOLTO: It never is .
MCCUTCHEON: Do n't kill me . I 'm not going to talk . I swear . Please .
HULL: Tell me about you .
MCCUTCHEON: Everything worth knowing you just found you .
HULL: Do n't hurt her .
ELIAS: Who 's grave ?
GALLEGOS: My wife 's . She died of leukemia three years ago . I like to be among the dead . They never interrupt you . Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee usinessman in Bogata hotels . He grew up . He made himself strong and ich , but getting there made him sick , and that killed him . So he lost everything for the same reason he 'd gotten it in the first place . Now we 'll see if you can do as well .
HULL: Who did Barbosa collect from ?
GALLEGOS: If you do n't know , you should n't have killed him .
GOPHER: I do n't want you in here . You killed the man , and I loved him . I do n't want to have anything to do with you .
ELIAS: Listen , you fucking monkey , you know who owed him money , and we know you know . Tell us or
HULL: He 'll tell us . Gopher , just Meaning deal with me or deal with Elias .
GOPHER: You ca n't tell anyone it was me .
HULL: Where the hell is all the money ? We 're still a million short .
ELIAS: I got ta get laid .
HULL: David , we 've got thirty-six hours .
ELIAS: Pick me up at Jacqueline 's in the morning .
HULL: Sooner than that .
CARVER: Get in .
HULL: What are you doing here ? You 're going to get me killed .
CARVER: Where the hell have you been ?
HULL: Doing my job .
CARVER: You violated a direct order to stay away from that bust . As a result , a police informant is dead , a state senator was critically injured in the tunnel pile up and a city policeman was subsequently murdered .
HULL: I did n't blow my cover .
CARVER: Do n't get smart with me , motherfucker .
HULL: Do n't be a shmuck , Gerry . I 'm talking to Gallegos . I 'm collecting his money . We can set him up right now .
CARVER: Never have , never will . I want you to give me your gun . You 're coming in right now .
HULL: Coming in where ?
CARVER: Your assignment has been terminated . You 're not going out there again . If I have to , I 'll put you in custody .
HULL: I 'm going to have Gallegos in two days .
CARVER: You violated orders , so you 're through . Do n't make a conspiracy theory out of it .
HULL: I 'm through ? Then , I might as well have a drink after all .
CARVER: You 're insane .
HULL: All the more reason to do what I say . Jesus , Ger , I 'm having trouble holding on
CARVER: All right !
HULL: Say it !
CARVER: It 's the State Department .
HULL: Guzman .
CARVER: Guzman , right . Our government supports Guzman because he 's a moderate . That 's a right-winger who 's pro-U.S . If Gallegos got busted here , it would hurt Guzman 's political career there . It 's politics , John , not drugs .
HULL: Drugs is politics . Politics is drugs Christ , Gerry , I dealt drugs . I killed a man . Others died . What did I do all this for ? For nothing .
CARVER: I 'm going to Washington , John . I 'll ing you with me . We 'll have clout , money
HULL: I did n't do this for clout or money . You said we were gon na do some good .
CARVER: We tried .
HULL: Trying 's for college boys . If all there is is power and money If all there is then what am I doing here ? 'Cause I can get more power and money out on the street , I got more there already , than I 'd ever get kissing your ass in Washington
CARVER: But you ca n't do that , John . It 's not you .
HULL: Me ? There is no me . We took care of that . First I was a cop pretending to be a dealer . Now I 'm just a deale pretending to be a cop . Why not stop pretending ? Quit the force . Be a dealer .
CARVER: It 's not that simple .
HULL: My assignment 's already terminated . All I have to do is quit . I hereby quit . My first one . Not so bad .
CARVER: Do n't blow your cover .
MCCUTCHEON: What 's the matter ?
HULL: Who are you , my mother ?
MCCUTCHEON: Tell me .
HULL: Tell you what ?
MCCUTCHEON: What you came to say .
HULL: What did I come to say ?
MCCUTCHEON: Then tell me anything . Something about you . Something real .
HULL: When I was young , I occasionally stole things . My father died when I was ten . Right in front of me .
MCCUTCHEON: Oh , baby She holds him , and he lets himself be held .
HULL: You 're not doing the stuff anymore , are you ? Pulls playfully at her nose .
MCCUTCHEON: No . Do n't change the subject .
HULL: How is that ?
MCCUTCHEON: It 's hard . John !
HULL: Things are getting , they 're getting a little confusing . I had certain plans , and people have n't come through exactly as they promised .
MCCUTCHEON: What do you expect with those people ?
HULL: It 's not just those people . It 's it 's bigger than that . It 's of everybody . Present company excluded .
MCCUTCHEON: You 've got to stop this , John , you know that . You got ta get out .
HULL: I ca n't .
MCCUTCHEON: Of course , you can .
HULL: No ! This is what I 'm supposed to do .
MCCUTCHEON: Supposed to ? Who said you 're supposed to ?
HULL: The whole fuckin ' world . You think I did n't try something else ? But everything funnels you right back here . Like it 's where you had to go all along .
MCCUTCHEON: But you know what you 're doing , do n't you , selling this stuff ? Doing to our own .
HULL: If I tried to get out now , they 'd kill me .
MCCUTCHEON: I ca n't be with somebody 's who involved in drugs .
GOPHER: I told you everyone . Everyone who owed him , everyone he One eight ? He 's lying . Barbosa barely owed him a million . Hull and Elias look at each other .
TAFT: I got every money transfer , every phone call , all your laundry tickets .
MCCUTCHEON: What do you want ?
TAFT: John Hull .
MCCUTCHEON: I ca n't !
TAFT: Or you 'll go away 'til you 're a dried up old woman , and when you come out , ai n't nobody gon na want you . She covers her face .
HULL: What are you laughing at ?
GALLEGOS: Big brass balls . Collecting money makes you strong .
ELIAS: What 's that ?
GALLEGOS: I 'm telling our suppliers they got paid . They 'll be very happy . I 'm happy .
ELIAS: And we 're happy . Everybody 's happy . It 's a happy world .
GALLEGOS: So , how can I express my gratitude for a job well done ?
ELIAS: We want Barbosa 's business .
GALLEGOS: Done . Of course .
ELIAS: And , also , your business . All this . Your money , your dope , everything . Hull looks at Elias ; what 's going on ?
GALLEGOS: You 're tougher than I thought , but not that tough .
ELIAS: How tough is enough ?
HULL: No !
ELIAS: Thank you , John . I could n't have done that without you .
HULL: Jesus Christ
ELIAS: You taught me to take my work seriously .
HULL: What 's going on here , David ?
ELIAS: We 're taking over .
HULL: You 're doing too much stuff .
ELIAS: No , I 'm very clear . I 'm very , very clear . Ahora , usted nos assistamos . Enteindo ? Molto nods .

ELIAS: It works , John . It works .
HULL: Jesus
ELIAS: Disce a Senor Guzman que that we have his money , and we 're willing to talk as soon as he comes to town . We 'll know how to reach him . Okay ?
HULL: Yes . I ca n't believe you got us into this . All of fucking Latin America is going to be after our asses , including Renaldo Guzman who 's friends with fucking George Bush .
ELIAS: I know they 're coming after us . I want them to . We 'll give them the money , but we 'll make a deal fo ourselves . We 'll get what we need for the synthetic drugs . I 've thought it all out . I 've been thinking it out for years .
HULL: They 're going to get your family , David . They 'll kill your wife and daughter .
ELIAS: Nancy and Miranda left the country two days ago .
HULL: You knew about this then ? Elias smiles .
MCCUTCHEON: Hi , my name is Betty .
HULL: You ca n't go back .
BLONDE WOMAN: She got a fever and just burned up . She just burned up all of a sudden . It must have been bad stuff .
MCCUTCHEON: He should n't be here .
BLONDE WOMAN: Come on , James , we 'll go get a urrito .
TAFT: Cute kids
HULL: Give me that .
TAFT: Tell me something , who the fuck are you ?
HULL: Look , Mr. Taft , that 's your name , ight ? Leave me alone . I got things on my mind .
TAFT: I 'd think you would . You better have your goddamn life on your mind , o it 's gon na get away from you . It 's gon na burn up like that poor woman across the way . Like all of you 's gon na burn
HULL: And what do you do , Mr. Taft , except chase bad guys up and down the street with your dirty partner , neve catching anybody important ?
TAFT: I do what I can . Do you do what you can ? Maybe my partner was dirty . Maybe the chief 's dirty . And the mayor . And the President . Maybe God Himself 's taking something on the side . That 's their problem . But I 'll bust 'em if I can .
HULL: Get out of my room .
TAFT: Do n't deny who you are .
HULL: They 're my children . They live in Cleveland with their mother . I 'm divorced from her . I have n't seen them in some time . I want to , but I have n't been able to arrange it .
MCCUTCHEON: How much else do n't I know about you ?
HULL: Everything else Everything else is I do n't know .
MCCUTCHEON: Taft has all the evidence about my laundering . Hull 's upset .
HULL: Do it .
MCCUTCHEON: I ca n't . So , I 've got to get away . Far away . But I need money .
HULL: Money ? I got money
MCCUTCHEON: You know the first time , when I saw you in the bar ?
HULL: You would n't even look at me .

ELIAS: We all know that your cousin 's usiness is coming to an end . Costs have climbed while profits and the market Guzman waves get to the point .
GUZMAN: The racist Americans just want to cut us poor Hispanics out of the market .
ELIAS: There are no Americans anymore , Mr. Guzman , you know that . No Hispanics , no Japanese , no blacks , no whites , no anything . There are only rich people and poor people . We 're rich , so we 're on the same side .
TAFT: Do they have money in there ?
GOPHER: I do n't know .
TAFT: They would n't meet here otherwise .
ELIAS: We 're prepared to give you 80 % of the money . The remainder you invest in our business with proceeds paid out according to the figures there .
GUZMAN: This looks interesting . I 'd have to confirm everything , of course . Do you have a sample of the product ?

TUVIA: What is it ?
BEN ZION: The new ones , they are from Novagroduk . Your wife Tuvia tenses . Ben Zion hesitates
TUVIA: Thank you for telling me . We have to dig a trench around the new zemylanka . If it rains I 'm afraid water will seep in . Tuvia clearly can not deal with his news .
BEN ZION: I 'll see to it , then .
ARON: Jacob 's ladders . Like in his dream . Asael says you can see the angels .
RACHEL: Can we stay to watch ?
ARON: If we hide .
RACHEL: Is that a Nazi train ?
ARON: If we had some dynamite we could low the shit out of it .
RACHEL: ( with undisguised
AWE: Just like your brothers .
SHIMON: I am sorry for your loss . Tuvia nods . He is deep inside himself .
TUVIA: She was a beautiful woman . But cold . Not a day went by she did n't emind me I was n't a good provider . For years it was n't really a marriage at all . And now
BELLA: You have lipstick ? Please , I know you have some left .
ZUS: Of course .
BELLA: You get lonely out here ?
ZUS: I like the woods . LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft through the trees .
BELLA: I 'm a little scared out here .
ZUS: Go ahead .
BELLA: Why is there a rule against women having guns ?
ZUS: There are n't enough for the men .
BELLA: Women need guns , too .
ZUS: What for ?
BELLA: For protection .
ZUS: Women have men for protection .
BELLA: I want protection .
ASAEL: Do n't panic . THIS WAY ! . GO .
TUVIA: Lova , Ben Zion stay with us . Asael , keep them moving . Do n't stop !
KISSELY: This way
TUVIA: Go ! Go ! Move ! Isaac , keep them moving ! Zus , Asael , Ben Zion
THE FOOL?: The policemen exchange apprehensive looks .
POLICEMAN: Give us Bielski and the rest of you can go free !
TUVIA: You are from Belarussia , pig ! Why do you work for the Germans against your own people ?
KISSELY: For the same reason you steal from the poor . To survive .
ZUS: Next one is to the head !
TUVIA: Soon it will be dark See how you find your way home then ! The policemen are having similar thoughts .
ZUS: Next time just draw them a map .
TUVIA: What does that mean ?
ZUS: It means we should have killed the fucking milkman . Your policy of diplomacy is shit .
MALBIN: Where is he taking us ? My feet are going to fall off .
SHIMON: A great rabbi once said , `` whereve I go , I am always going to the land of Israel . ''
MALBIN: Well , maybe rabbis should give bette directions . Tuvia walks alongside but apart .
TUVIA: Rest and eat . I need volunteers for a scouting party .
TUVIA: A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades .
GRAMOV: What brigade ?
TUVIA: We belong to the Bielski otriad .
GRAMOV: We know of you . Jewish bandits .
ZUS: I 'll take the two on the left Tuvia maintains his composure .
TUVIA: I 'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander .
VIKTOR: I am Viktor Panchenko , commander of the October otriad . We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us . How do you respond to these charges ?
TUVIA: When you take food it is from loyal supporters . When we do , you call it stealing .
VIKTOR: We are soldiers .
TUVIA: And we fight a common enemy . The motherland does n't distinguish etween Jews and non-Jews . Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma .
VIKTOR: But Jews do not fight .
TUVIA: These Jews do . Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment .
VIKTOR: We will see . Select your best fighters and send them to us . Zus looks at Tuvia , knowing he has no choice .
TUVIA: We are honored to be of service .
ZUS: So we 're partisans now .
TUVIA: As if we have a choice .
HAMMER: Here .
MALBIN: If my friends at The New Socialists ' Club could see me now I have n't read a book in months .
TUVIA: I have n't read one in years . Malbin looks up from his work .
MALBIN: .I did .
TUVIA: Yet you accept me as Commander .
MALBIN: Who else ?
TUVIA: But ?
MALBIN: Other things are important , too .
TUVIA: Such as ? Malbin tries to think how best to put it .
MALBIN: Community .
TUVIA: You have more ideas ? About all this ?
MALBIN: A few .
TUVIA: I 'm listening
BELLA: More mouths to feed .
RONA: More young bodies to keep us warm .
SHULMAN: Which one is Tuvia Bielski ?
CHAYA: My parents
TUVIA: We 'll do what we can .
CHAYA: You will help my parents ?
CHAYA: I 've seen you looking at me . If you were to rescue them , I would do anythingyou
ASAEL: No . I mean , yes . All right .
ZUS: And what exactly does that mean , 'do what we can . '
TUVIA: We must send for whoever is left alive .
ZUS: And if it is a hundred ? Six hundred ?
TUVIA: Then we will provide .
ZUS: And when the Germans follow these hundreds and slaughter us .
TUVIA: I wo n't let that happen .
ZUS: You wo n't let that happen .
TUVIA: No . I 'll bring them out myself .
ZUS: From the ghetto .
TUVIA: Yes .
ZUS: Pan Tuvia . Rabbi Tuvia . Allow me to kiss your hand
TUVIA: I can not have you contradicting me Not when others are around . Our family must stick together .
ZUS: And who is it that 's risking ou family , and for what ? For the sake of these ( gestures at the new
ARRIVALS: Malbushim .
TUVIA: Do n't call them that .
ZUS: That 's who comes to us from the ghetto . Empty clothes . Bloodsuckers .
TUVIA: They are people . Jews .
ZUS: Pretentious Jews . Jews who stuck up their noses and would n't give us the time of day when we passed them on the street . Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands .
SAVAGELY: You think your old teacher will give you a good grade because you saved his worthless ass ! They accept you as their leader only because they are too weak and full of shit to help themselves .
TUVIA: What about Bella ?
ZUS: Is this your business ?
ASAEL: No .
ZUS: Good . I 'll dance at your wedding .
TUVIA: This way .
ELDER #1: We are not so naive as to believe they wo n't kill some of us . But all the Jews ? It makes no sense . They need us to work . In the factories . The labor camps .
TUVIA: There are rumors . Of death camps .
ELDER #1: We too have heard of such places . But have you seen them yourself ? Can you tell me , with absolute certainty , that we are not just as likely to die out there with you in the woods with Winter coming on ?
TUVIA: What if we were to take all of you ?
ELDER #1: The old , the sick ? There are thousands . How will we live ?
TUVIA: We will protect you . We have made alliances with the Russian Partisans .
ELDER #1: They are as bad as the Nazi 's . You are too young to know the pogroms
TUVIA: YOU WANT TIME ? Fine , I give you a day . A month . Maybe a year . To live ! Your daughter is out there with us . Your husband is waiting for you . An old orthodox RABBI stands nearby .
RABBI: Weare waiting for God .
LILKA: I am going .
MALBIN: And now they belong to the otriad . Everyone sacrifices for the sake of the collective . We can trade these for food or weapons . Next
SHIMON: How about carpenters ? Any ootmakers ? Seamstresses ?
ARRIVAL #1: I am an accountant .
DEADPAN: That should come in handy . Next
RIVA: I am a nurse .
SHIMON: Ahhhwelcome . And you , tateh ? OPPENHEIM is an old man with thick glasses .
OPPENHEIM: I am a watchmaker . Tuvia has walked over to observe .
TUVIA: Can you repair guns ?
OPPENHEIM: Guns ? No .
TUVIA: See if you can fix this trigger .
SHULMAN: Look what we found running free . Must have belonged to an aristocrat .
TUVIA: My God , she 's beautiful . May I ?
LITTLE BOY: He is a Jew ?
TUVU: Pregnancies are forbidden . We can not accommodate an infant 's needs . Ou unkers are overcrowded so you will have to build new ones . He looks out over the sea of expectant faces .
CONTINUING: This is the one place in all of Belorussia where a Jew can be free . We will make again , here in this forest , the life that was taken from you . We welcome you into ou community .
RIVA: You are Tuvia Bielski ? You are eally him ? ( Tuvia nods
TENTATIVELY: You are a hero . A Maccabee .
LILKA: Get them off ! Get them off me !
CHAYA: What ? Where ?
RIVA: Lice need somewhere to sleep , too .
TAMARA: You get rid of them quicker if you oil them .
BELLA: Tamara , come on in , it 's freezing and slimy and horrible . Tamara shakes her head , no .
RIVA: So modest
BELLA: So last night I dreamed I was taking a real bath . With hot water .
RACHEL: And soap .
RIVA: And bubbles .
CHAYA: Oh , take me to that dream !
RIVA: I was dreaming of shoes
CHAYA: Shoes , Riva ?
RIVA: There was a man in a shop on Grudek street and the way he caressed my feet when I tried on his shoes
BELLA: Does n't take a fortune teller to know what Lilka 's dreaming about
GRAMOV: buried underneath with this
DETONATOR: almost touching the rail . As the train passes , its weight causes pressure on the detonator , and then
TAMARA: Yesterday , potatoes with beets , Today , beets with potatoes . Special treat tomorrowpotato soup . With eets .
ARKADY: We love potatoes , do n't we , boys ! Here , put some hair on your chest ! They give Aron his first taste .
NEARBY: Bella is walking , arm in arm , with Asael .
BELLA: Soa little bird told me that a certain someone is waitingfo another certain someone to ask a certain question Go on
ASAEL: Hello , Chaya .
CHAYA: Hello , Asael .
ASAEL: MayI help you ?
CHAYA: Wash clothes ? I do n't think so .
ASAEL: Chaya Iwaswonderingif maybeyouI mean you and I
CHAYA: I accept .
ASAEL: You do ?
CHAYA: I do .
ASAEL: Behold thou art consecrated unto me y this ring according to the Laws of Moses and Israel .
ZUS: Get up ! Move ! SHOOT OR I 'LL SHOOT
VIKTOR: You are related to Bielski ?
ZUS: I am a Bielski , too . Viktor looks at him appraisingly .
VIKTOR: Indeed . He walks away . Zus has found a home .
ASAEL: There is talk of returning to the ghetto .
TUVIA: Madness .
ASAEL: They 've barely eaten in days . Even when our food missions manage to get through , there are armed patrols . Farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns . Tuvia considers for a moment .
TUVIA: Send out more missions . And bring shotguns .
VIKTOR: Another dead soldier !
ZUS: That is soRussian .
VIKTOR: At least you drink like one .
ZUS: ' A Jew ca n't drink , a Jew ca n't fight . ' What is it we are good at , Viktor ? Dying . That is what we are good at .
VIKTOR: So tell me about this brother of yours
ZUS: .Asael ?
VIKTOR: You are such an idiot .
ZUS: I know who you mean The Great Tuvia Bielski . Savior of the Jews and all around Big Shit .
VIKTOR: You compete with him .
ZUS: He competes with me .
VIKTOR: My older brother and I have the same relationship .
ZUS: He is a Big Shit also ?
VIKTOR: A soldier . He was killed in the first hour of the German invasion . This sobers them up a bit .
TUVIA: Lilka ?
LILKA: Sorry , Tuvia . I wasthinking . It 's nothing .
CHATTERING: I 'm sorry .
TUVIA: Everyone here has lost someone .
LILKA: You too ?
TUVIA: Here
LILKA: No . Today I go on my first food mission .
TUVIA: I will have Asael send someone else .
LILKA: No . I must go now . I want to go .
TUVIA: You know how to use this ?
MOTL LUBCZANSKI: She is a tasty one , your aristocrat .
TUVIA: She is not my aristocrat .
ARKADY LUBCZANSKI: No ? We were told , 'hands off , ' property of the Commander . Tuvia just stares , daring him to continue .
TUVIA: Lazar . I am coming from camp . The danger is from those coming to camp .
SHEEPISH: Sorry , Tuvia
TUVIA: No sign of the food mission ?
LAZAR: Not yet . Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods .
SHULMAN: We must n't have any tracks leading ack to base .
RIVA: several cases of pneumonia Also I 'm beginning to see signs of scurvy . No one 's had a vegetable in weeks .
LAZAR: Tuvia !
RIVA: Bring him to the infirmary .
LILKA: Shoo Shoo
TUVIA: What 's wrong with them all ?
RIVA: If it 's typhus we 're in trouble . The lice are carriers .
ASAEL: The partisans have ampicillin . But they say they need it for themselves .
TUVIA: Medicine for typhus . I heard you . I 'll go see Viktor right away .
LILKA: Fine . Thank you .
TUVIA: I must go .
VIKTOR: and every time we try to move , they radio back to police HQ which houses the transmitterhere .
ZUS: So we attack the transmitter .
VIKTOR: Yes , yes , my Hebrew warrior . Except for the troops in Stankiewcze and the machine guns out front .
TUVIA: We have sickness . I need ampicillin .
VIKTOR: This medicine is reserved fo fighters .
TUVIA: If typhus breaks out in our camp , it may spread to yours .
VIKTOR: I will have to take that chance .
TUVIA: I must insist . Comrade .
VIKTOR: You 'd better not .
ZUS: There would be medicine in the police headquarters at Stankiewcze , yes ?
TUVIA: Of course . Zus grabs his submachine gun .
ZUS: Krensky , Ben Zion . Let 's go .
TUVIA: I 'm going in with you .
ZUS: I give the orders tonight . Across the square , the police station looms .
TUVIA: You do n't have to do this .
ZUS: I do n't ? What about the typhus ?
TUVIA: So more die . They will anyway .
ZUS: I have been given this mission by my superior officer .
TUVIA: Zus For luck .
BEN ZION: Let 's GO !
ZUS: Go . GO !
TUVIA: What about the others ? !
ZUS: Medicine .
TUVIA: The others ?
ZUS: Fighters die so that malbushim may live , that 's what you believe , yes ?
TUVIA: So you 're a communist now , Zus ?
ZUS: Communist , Zionist , Manicurist , what difference does it make ? You got your medicine .
TUVIA: Come back to us . Zus wo n't look at him .
ZUS: So you remember .
SHIMON: Merciful God , we commit our friends Ben Zion and Krensky to your care . We have no more prayers , no more tears . We have run out of blood . Choose another people We PAN PAST the familiar faces .
ARKADY: Next time , I cut off your nose , pisher .
TUVIA: Whassa problem , Arkady ?
ARKADY: Those who risk their lives to bring ack food deserve a larger portion than those who risk nothing .
ASAEL: Everyone gets the same portion .
ARKADY: Not when you 're serving , pisher . I see you digging to the bottom of the pot for your little forest cutie and her parents
ASAEL: She is my wife !
TUVIA: Policy isSame for all . If someone is stealing he 'll face consequences .
ASAEL: What consequences ?
TUVIA: Reduced rations for one week . Both of you .
ASAEL: Tuvia , I would never
TUVIA: Yes . I know .
ASAEL: Then why am I to be punished ?
TUVIA: What ?
ASAEL: that you drink too much and are no longer fit to lead us .
TUVIA: .Maybe they 're right .
ASAEL: Zus would have punched him senseless .
TUVIA: Zus .
ASAEL: I miss him .
ÃŸ TUVIA: He has made his choice . He reels away toward the woods .
SHIMON: Drink this .
WINKS: From the bottom of the pot . Tuvia can barely get the soup down .
TUVIA: the way they look at me with their pasty faces . Let them starve , we 're all going to die out here anyway .
SHIMON: Not easy being the big boss . Moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage .
TUVIA: Moses .
SHIMON: So I 'm a sucker for a biblical allusion . But what is society without leaders . Without leaders , we falter .
TUVIA: I am not a leader .
SHIMON: Neither was Moses , but somehow that seemed to work out .
ZUS: Lova , what happened ? Who did this ? Lova sits and buries his head in his hands .
LOVA: Gramov . Two others . I used the officer 's latrine .
ZUS: For this they beat you ? Lova is trying not to weep .
LOVA: They said they would n't shit in the same hole as a Jew . Zus gets to his feet .
ZUS: Forgive me , Commander .
PANCHENKO: Zus . Join us .
ZUS: I want to report the mistreatment of a comrade . Gramov looks up . Zus meets his eye .
GRAMOV: I had a perfectly good reason . He is a Jew .
PANCHENKO: and you are an ignorant Tartar . Ignore him . Here
ZUS: Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline .
PANCHENKO: He 's right , Gramov . Apologize to the Jew .
GRAMOV: I apologize , Jew .
PANCHENKO: There . You see ? Now drink up .
LILKA: Your fever broke in the night . The medicine helped .
TUVIA: How long was I asleep ?
LILKA: Two days .
TUVIA: And you 've nursed me the whole time ?
LILKA: Chaya helped .
TUVIA: Did you study nursing at university ?
LILKA: We devoted ourselves to more essential knowledge like Greek Philosophy and Latin .
TUVIA: I never went to university .
LILKA: What kind of work did you do ? Before .
TUVIA: My wife 's father had a store . Before the Race Laws . She is is dead .
LILKA: I 'm sorry .
TUVIA: Tell me more about university .
LILKA: It all feels like a dream . I spent months trying to master Chopin 's nocturnes .
TUVIA: I 'd love to hear you play .
LILKA: You know Chopin ?
TUVIA: Who does n't ? Chopin the butche from Novogrudok .
LAUGHS: If you 're well enough to tease me , you 're well enough to eat . I 'll see what 's for supper . She gets up to go .
TUVIA: Thank you , Lilka .
LAZAR: Hey , Arkady This is n't soup , it 's piss .
ARKADY: I will piss on your head and you will say it 's raining . Eat it . The rest of Lubczanski 's cabal laughs .
TUVIA: What happened ?
ARKADY: New policy . Fighters get bette food .
TUVIA: Against my orders
ARKADY: You are no longer Commander . Sorry .
TUVIA: As long as I am the leader of this group , you will obey my commands .
CHAYA: Who has the soap ? I know there was a little left ?
BELLA: Use the sand . It 's good for you skin .
RIVA: And what skin ! And already married , too !
BELLA: I 've turned into a skeleton .
CHAYA: And you were always so worried about staying slim .
BELLA: When we get out of this forest I am going to eat only cake and grow as ig as a house .
LILKA: Join us . At least the sun is warm . Tamara ?
TAMARA: I ca n't , Lilka I 'm pregnant .
LILKA: I had no idea .
TAMARA: I 've kept it hidden for months but now it 's obvious . No one can know .
LILKA: ..Who is the father ?
TAMARA: I- It was when I was escaping . A man with a gun stopped me . I thought he was a Partisan . He told me to follow him and he took me to this place
LILKA: He will understand .
TAMARA: No . You must n't tell him !
LILKA: I wo n't . Do n't worry . What are you going to do ? Tamara 's eyes fill with a new resolve .
TAMARA: I feel this new life inside me . It 's the only thing keeping me going . I wo n't give it up , I 'll kill myself . Lilka puts her arm around her .
MALBIN: You call that a move ?
SHIMON: I call it an inevitable conclusion ased on unimpeachable reasoning .
MALBIN: I 'm thinking about what I 'm going to do about it .
SHIMON: Aha ! I got him !
MALBIN: You did n't get me . You think you got me ? How about this ?
GOBSMACKED: Who would make a move like that ?
MALBIN: A genius maybe .
ARON: Tuvia We SEE Aron whispering in Tuvia 's ear .
TUVIA: Asael ! Asael comes running .
ASAEL: Lazar spotted another patrol . They 're getting closer .
TUVIA: Do you hear that ?
LILKA: She promises not to take extra food
TUVIA: This is against my orders .
LILKA: So you are going to shoot her , too ?
TUVIA: I can not allow it . He turns away .
LILKA: You must let it live !
TUVIA: I can not keep the living alive . Tamara and the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate .
LILKA: She was raped by the Nazis .
TUVIA: Lilka
LILKA: I knew what was expected of the women here yet you never touched me
TUVIA: Shhh..
LILKA: I 'm not afraid of anything , Tuvia . I 'm not even afraid of you . They kiss deeply .
TUVIA: The Germans are coming into the forest . I do n't know what is going to become of us .
LILKA: It does n't matter . If I had stayed in the ghetto I 'd be dead . You saved my life .
TUVIA: No . You have saved mine .
MALBIN: Oh ..I.. Hello , Lilka .
LILKA: Hello , Asael .
TUVIA: Yes ?
MALBIN: We 've caught one .
ASAEL: He 's a scout .
TUVIA: They 're coming for us .
ASAEL: We found this in his pouch .
TUVIA: Entrance points , wetlands , obstacles . You read this .
SHIMON: They 've assigned an entire division to surround the forest . A tidal wave is coming .
ASAEL: Do n't they have a war to fight ?
SHIMON: Assault begins in two days . Passover . How fitting .
MOTL: Monster ! He kicks him in the head .
SHULMAN: Bulvan ! Shulman PUNCHES him in the face .
GERMAN COURIER: Bitte.Bitte
TUVIA: Did you reach Viktor ?
ASAEL: He 's on his way .
TUVIA: The German lets loose a torrent of pleading .
GERMAN COURIER: Ich habe frau und kinder !
SHIMON: He says he has a wife and children .
LAZAR: So did I !
RIVA: If you let him go , he will lead them back here . Tuvia looks at Malbin . What to do ?
MALBIN: Ask if he 'll promise not to reveal our location . Shimon translates .
SHIMON: Sie mussen versprechen nicht zu sagan wo wir sind . The man looks up at him , pleadingly .
GERMAN COURIER: Nein.Nein
SHULMAN: He 'll say anything . He breaks the stick across the man 's back .
LAZAR: We want justice
MOTL: Justice
BELLA: My son 's name was David . David Kagan .
RIVA: My sister 's name was Ellie
MIRIAM: My husband was Meyer
MOTL: My parents , Sol and Raya .
AVRAM: For my daughter , Sonya .
MORDECAI: For my mother .
RACHEL: My sister .
LILKA: My whole family .
TUVIA: Reeboynoy shel oylum Lord of the Universe . We have done unspeakable things yet still I seek your mercy
MALBIN: Viktor is here .
ZUS: He does n't look good .
ASAEL: I could say the same about you . Where 'd you get the jacket ?
ZUS: Let 's just say the former owner no longer had need of it .
WHISPERING: Hide this . Wolnicky stores ammunition for us in his barn . There 's no guard .
VIKTOR: You found these on the prisoner ?
TUVIA: We ca n't fight an entire division .
VIKTOR: The battle on the Eastern Front has egun . The more troops we engage here , the fewer they have to attack the Motherland .
TUVIA: We 've done our part for the Motherland .
VIKTOR: My orders are to take command of all partisan operations . You will ing the rest of your fighters to me .
TUVIA: And the others ? Old people , women and children .
VIKTOR: In war there are casualties .
TUVIA: And if I refuse ?
VIKTOR: You are officially a deserter . Do you know the policy on dealing with deserters ? Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket .
ASAEL: I would n't show this around . There are some who 'd turn you in for less .
ZUS: You want them to find Tuvia 's camp . Viktor just looks at him .
VIKTOR: No . So we can keep fighting . Everyone must sacrifice in the struggle .
ZUS: Those are my brothers .
VIKTOR: I am your brother ! He is you other ! Comrade Zus . Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming , ut counter-revolutionary .
SHIMON: but the children of Israel were afraid to leave Egypt . Until Moses said , 'Do not trust in me , trust in God . ' He will take care of you ' And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done fo centuries .
MALBIN: Did it see us ?
TUVIA: Tomorrow is Passover . Yes ?
MALBIN: How should I know ?
TUVIA: Moses . The Exodus . Malbin does n't get it at first .
MALBIN: You want to move them all ? The old , the sick . They 'll never make it .
TUVIA: We leave now . Spread the word .
ASAEL: Come , tateh
OPPENHEIM: But my tools
MALBIN: Are you alright ?
ASAEL: Get them out of the bunkers !
ASAEL: With Levine and Miriam There . Lazar , Rosa , and Schmuel . There and there . And me . Tuvia shakes his head , no .
MALBIN: Everybody out ! Now !
TUVIA: Do n't try to fight Just slow them down . Then join us .
ASAEL: Take her .
TUVIA: Come .
MALBIN: This swamp heregoesfor miles .
TUVIA: Show me .
MALBIN: Oh , my God
TUVIA: Are the others back yet ? ..Asael ?
SHULMAN: We 've got to keep going !
BELLA: The Germans will be here any minute !
MALBIN: Do we waita while ?
MORDECAI: We could hide
MAN #3: I say , fight them here .
MOTL: Yes . Fight !
SHULMAN: That 's crazy !
MALBIN: Tuvia ?
RONA: There are snakes
SHULMAN: We 'll put them on our shoulders .
BELLA: Tuvia , what do we do ? Oppenheim is petrified . Rona is crying .
TUVIA: And still Tuvia is silent .
SHIMON: He ..is ..tired . Malbin hears something , looks up .
COME: He shakes his head .
TUVIA: You have a weapon ?
VOICE: Why are we stopping ?
TAMARA: In there ?
RONA: It is impossible ! More murmuring . Asael raises his voice .
ASAEL: Nothing is impossible ! What we have done is impossible ! The murmuring quiets .
RONA: But how ?
ASAEL: Not by miracles . By our strength .
SHULMAN: We do n't have enough rope .
ASAEL: We 'll link arms . Make a chain . A human chain .
MOTL: What are you talking about ?
TUVIA: Each person takes care of the other . .Give him your belt .
ONE MAN: Removes his belt and offers it to Asael .
TUVIA: No tracks on land . Get back in .
WHISPERING: How much farther ? Malbin shrugs his shoulders . Who knows ?
TUVIA: Come
MALBIN: Is he ?
TUVIA: Take off your glasses . Reflections . Tuvia moves off to check on the others .
MALBIN: Shimon , listen to me , the physical plane is just an illusion . Only the spiritual plane is real .
SHIMON: No . The physical plane is where man acts to redeem himself .
MALBIN: You 've redeemed yourself enough , you should shut up now .
SHIMON: Look who 's talking about shutting up I need to tell you something .
MALBIN: What is it ?
SHIMON: You should n't think so much . The world around you is beautiful .
MALBIN: This world ?
SHIMON: Even this one .
TUVIA: We 're lost .
LILKA: No . ..No . She puts her arms around him .
TUVIA: Not a sound . Pass the word .
PANCHENKO: You will hold this crossroads until the brigade has completed its etreat . Zus looks around at the position .
ZUS: For how long ?
PANCHENKO: Until you are ordered to withdraw .
ZUS: And if we can not hold the position ?
PANCHENKO: Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline , if necessary .
ZUS: I am so honored , Comrade .
LOVA: What are we doing here ? Zus ?
SHULMAN: What 's nextSinai ?
SHIMON: .Tuvia
TUVIA: Right here . Shimon is at the end .
SHIMON: Somethingto say
TUVIA: Shhhh
SHIMON: noplease I almost lostmy faith.but youwere sent..by God..to save us .

COLIN: Fucking firemen are getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire . Or pussy .
BARRIGAN: What are you looking at ? Forget it . Your father was a janitor , and his son 's only a cop .
COLIN: You 're in trouble if you 're `` only '' anything .
BARRIGAN: Do n't tell me I 'm looking at the first dickhead-American president of the United States .
COSTELLO: School 's out . You earned it . Yeah , no more teachers , no more books .

QUEENAN: Congratulations on passing the detective exam , and welcome to the Special Investigation Unit .
DIGNAM: Whoop-di fuckin ' do .
QUEENAN: We wo n't be working directly together , you 'll be working fo Captain Ellerby , but I like to see everybody . You 're a worker , you rise fast .
DIGNAM: Like a twelve year old 's dick .
COLIN: Thank you , Sergeant .
DIGNAM: My pleasure .
COLIN: Thank you , sir .
QUEENAN'S SECRETARY: Congratulations .
COLIN: Thanks , hon .
QUEENAN'S SECRETARY: You can go in there now .
QUEENAN: You can sit .
BILLY: Sir , yes , sir , I have an idea
SGT. DIGNAM: Whoa , let 's say you have no idea and leave it there . No idea . Zip , none . If you had an idea about what we do we would not be good at what we do . We would be cunts . Are you calling us cunts ?
QUEENAN: Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his own . I 'm afraid we all have to deal with it .
SGT. DIGNAM: You have family connections down in Southie . Through your father . Tell us about your uncle Jackie .
BILLY: Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer fo Jordan Marsh .
SGT. DIGNAM: Uncle Jackie was a small-time ookie who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville .
BILLY: That 's right . I remember his funeral .
SGT. DIGNAM: Closed casket ?
BILLY: That 's right .
SGT. DIGNAM: You tell anybody at Deerfield - that is , before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a folding chair - you had an uncle met his demise like that ?
BARRIGAN: What you got ? `` Staff Sergeant '' . In four years you 're a sergeant .
COLIN: SIU . What a country .
BARRIGAN: Perfect .
COLIN: I do n't mind going it alone . If you could go it alone you might get somewhere yourself .
BARRIGAN: We 're cops . This is n't `` somewhere '' .
COLIN: I know you 're a worker . I might be able to do something for you . You got any suits at home or you like coming to work looking like you 're gon na invade Poland .
SGT. DIGNAM: Let 's look at the rest of the family tree . Your maggot uncle Tommy Costiganhe 's another goof got busted selling guns to federal officers . Among many , many , many other departures from , ah , `` normative behavior '' .
BILLY: What 's this got to do with me ?
SGT. DIGNAM: Why are you pretending to be a cop ?
ELLERBY: This unit is new , and you are the newest members of it . You have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude .
DIGNAM: Your old man was a hump from Southie . Baggage-handler at the airport . Family 's all criminals except your old man .
BILLY: And one priest . Since you seem to know everything .
DIGNAM: I ai n't sure about him , either . Family 's dug into the Southie projects like ticks . Lifers down there . Three decker men at best . You grew up , however , up the North shore . La di da .
SGT. DIGNAM: You have different accents ? You did , did n't you . You were different fuckin ' people .
BILLY: You a psychiatrist ?
SGT. DIGNAM: If I was I 'd ask you why you 're a Statie making thirty grand a year . And I think if I were Sigmund fucking Freud himself I would n't get an answer . So tell me , what 's a lace curtain motherfucker like you doing in the Staties ?
BILLY: Well . Families are always rising o falling in America . Am I right ?
QUEENAN: Who said that ?
BILLY: Hawthorne .
DIGNAM: What 's the matter , smartass ? You do n't know any fuckin ' Shakespeare ?
QUEENAN: We have a question . You want to be a cop , or do you want to appear to e a cop . It 's an honest question . Lot of guys want to appear to be cops . Gun . Badge . Pretend they 're on TV
SGT. DIGNAM: A lot of em just want to slam a nigger 's head through a plate glass window .
BILLY: I 'm all set without your personal job application , Sergeant .
DIGNAM: What the fuck did you say to me , trainee ?
BILLY: Sir , with all due respect , sir , what is it you want from me ?
DIGNAM: Hey asshole , he ca n't help you . I know what you are , and what you are n't . I 'm the best friend you ever had on the face of the earth . I 'm gon na help you understand something You 're no fuckin ' cop .
QUEENAN: He 's right . We deal in deceptions here . But what we do n't deal with is self- deception . In five years , you might e anything else in the world , but you wo n't be a Massachusetts State trooper .
BILLY: You sure of that ?
QUEENAN: I 'm sure of that .
DIGNAM: Guaranteed .
QUEENAN: You do n't have much family .
BILLY: I do n't have any family .
WASP UNCLE: What 's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman ?
BILLY: You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father 's funeral ? That Stephanie ?
UNCLE: That Stephanie .
BILLY: Nothing much to it Uncle Edward .
UNCLE: Are you trying to prove something to the family ?
BILLY: When you say `` family '' , what do you mean ? You ?
UNCLE: You always question everything , do n't you ?
BILLY: Yeah , well , maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time . `` Am I an asshole ? '' `` Are my kids a mess ? '' `` Is my wife a money-grubbing whore ? '' Those are questions . `` Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to e ? '' Too late now , right ?
UNCLE: Do you need some money for the funeral ?
BILLY: When my mother dies we do n't have any connection . You got it ?
REALTOR: This is it . Nice . You 've got high ceilings , parquet floors . There 's a lock on the fridge in case you have eating issues . Jokenot a very good one . So , you 're a policeman ?
COLIN: I 'm a State Police detective .
REALTOR: State Police Detective . You a married State Police Detective ?
COLIN: No .
REALTOR: Oh , cuz it 's big and I wondered if a cop
COLIN: I have a cosigner .
REALTOR: You intend to have a housemate . That 's cool .
COLIN: Give me the fuckin ' papers .
BILLY: So what do I do ?
QUEENAN: During the war , Churchill used iver mines . He 'd float them down the rivers into Germany . They 'd either hit something , or not . That 's what we 'll use you for . I 'll float you down the river . The rest will happen . Or it wo n't
DIGNAM: Luck of the Irish . All that and you 're still young enough to fuck undergraduates .
QUEENAN: We ca n't conceal that you 've been a trainee . You 'll be convicted of a crime . We 're thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense .
DIGNAM: Given your nature .
QUEENAN: You 'll serve enough jail time to convince anyone that it 's no set- up . You 'll be on probation . The whole nine yards .
DIGNAM: I need you , pal . You 've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston .
BILLY: Every weekendSergeant .
DIGNAM: Perfect .
QUEENAN: Do it again . For me .
OTHER PRISONER: You 're Bill Costigan ?
BILLY: Who wants to know ?
OTHER PRISONER: Nothin . ' I know a Sean Costigan . L Street .
BILLY: My cousin .
OTHER PRISONER: Connected but not too bright No offense .
SGT. DIGNAM: Sorry I 'm late .
ELLERBY: Staff Sergeant Dignam is ou liaison with the undercove section . Their undercover work is extensive . He 's here to give us his eport . Sgt . Dignam .
SGT. DIGNAM: OK . They 're out there , my people . They 're like the fuckin ' Indians . You 're not gon na see them . You 're not gon na hear about them except through me or Captain Queenan . You will not , ever , know the identity of undercover people . This shit hole , unfortunately , has more fuckin ' leaks than the Iraqi navy .
ELLERBY: Fuck yourself .
SGT. DIGNAM: I 'm tired from fucking your wife .
ELLERBY: How 's your mother ?
SGT. DIGNAM: Good . She 's tired from fucking my father . OK , today , girls , what I got fo you is microprocessors .
COLIN: What was his name ? The , ah , departed .
SGT. DIGNAM: Myles Kennefick . Got the job with a forged UMass transcript . UMass Boston , which incidentally happens to be in
LAZIO: South Boston ?
SGT. DIGNAM: Who forged your transcript , dickhead ?
COLIN: I know that guy . His father runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart . Kennefick 's .
ELLERBY: We are not here to solve the `` Case of the Dead Scumbag '' . We are here to nail Costello .
SGT. DIGNAM: We got a guy says that he hears Costello is moving the processors to Chinathat he set up the whole fuckin ' job and popped Kennefick . You do n't want to miss it if Costello takes a dump .
ELLERBY: We 'd miss less if your informants were available to us , and of course to the FBI
LAZIO: Without asking for details , do you have anyone in with Costello presently ?
SGT. DIGNAM: Maybe . Maybe not . Maybe fuck yourself . My theory on Feds is they 're like mushrooms . Feed 'em shit and keep in the dark . You girls have a nice day .
BILLY'S AUNT: Billy ?
BILLY: Aunt Cathy ?
BILLY'S AUNT: Good to see you . Good to see you .
BILLY'S AUNT: They said you were in the Staties , I could n't believe it .
BILLY: I got kicked out about four months ago .
SEAN: It was in the papers .
BILLY: Well . So you know .
SEAN: And why are we graced with you presence ?
BILLY: I brought your mother some pictures of my father .
SEAN: I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for you troubles .
BILLY: No .
SEAN: When did I see you after that ?
BILLY: Not for a long time . Down the cape after Rose 's wedding . I think .
SEAN: Fuck , oh shit . I remember that , dude . I had that fuckin ' buck knife , right , and I cut all the ass numbas off the doors at the hotel . I was trippin'All of them . That was a night .
BILLY: Listen , I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died . Insurance .
SEAN: Yeah ?
BILLY: In your line of work , if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back ?
SEAN: My line of work I 'm not in that line of work just presently because I do n't have ten thousand dollars . As a matter of fact I have neve had ten thousand dollars .
BILLY: That 's what I 'm saying .
SEAN: You know what we usually say at these moments .
BILLY: You fuckin ' moron . What are you talking about ? I 'm not a cop . I 'm your cousin .
SEAN: Fuckin ' Ricans think they know everything . If they knew shit they would n't be Puerto Ricans .
BILLY: Why would you even think of stopping drinking ?
SEAN: He do n't like it . He do n't like drinkinhe do n't like fightin he says stay out of the bars You know , we 're not even supposed to do this on this side of fuckin ' Worcester .
BILLY: Who says ?
SEAN: He says . Costello says . God says , as far as you 're concerned .
VILLAIN: Cunt cop .
MISTER FRENCH: I knew his father . I liked his uncle Jackie better .
SEAN: Uncle Jackie was excellent .
BILLY: A cranberry juice .
MISTER FRENCH: Do you know me ?
BILLY: No .
MISTER FRENCH: I 'm the guy who tells you there are guys you hit and there are guys you do n't . That 's not quite a guy you ca n't hit , but it 's almost a guy you ca n't hit , so I 'm fucking uling on it right now that you do n't hit him , understand ?
BILLY: Yeah . Excellent . Fine .
MISTER FRENCH: I know you . I know your family . Also I know you do another drug deal with your idiot fucking cop- magnet cousin I 'll forget you grandmother was very nice to me and cut your fucking nuts off . You understand that ?
BILLY: Yeah .
MISTER FRENCH: Now you know me .
BILLY: Yeah .
MISTER FRENCH: What are you drinking ?
BILLY: Cranberry juice .
MISTER FRENCH: What is it , your period ?
DRESSED SCUMBAG: That 's Jackie 's nephew .
MISTER FRENCH: Oh , what ?
FRENCH: Get the fuck out of here .
COLIN: Mrs. Kennefick , Myles and I were in school together . Myles was behind me in school but I knew him . I will get those responsible . Do n't you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a robbery and then killed him ?
MRS KENNEFICK: Allegedly .
COLIN: `` Allegedly '' .
MRS KENNEFICK: If he was killed he probably did something wrong .
COLIN: You do n't mean robbery do you , Mrs Kennefick ? That 's not what you think he did wrong .
COSTELLO: Wave to your girlfriend .
MRS KENNEFICK: I mean fuck yourself .
COLIN: You get that ?
BARRIGAN: `` Allegedly '' or `` fuck yourself ? ''
COLIN: Welcome to the neighborhood .
COSTELLO: Cut 'em here .
COLIN: Making a house call ?
MADOLYN: Have I seen you professionally ?
COLIN: No , no . I know what you do . I know who you are .
MADOLYN: I have an appointment on this floor .
COLIN: That 's good . They 're all fuckin ' crazy on that floor . I 'm one floor up .
MADOLYN: Oh , fancy policeman .
COLIN: That 's right . Fancy .
MADOLYN: Are you a Statie ?
COLIN: Yeah , I 'm also getting my law degree .
MADOLYN: Suffolk , nights ?
COLIN: They do n't run Harvard Law at night , last time I checked .
MADOLYN: When was the last time you checked ?
COLIN: Before I went to fucking Suffolk .
MADOLYN: I went to U Mass . I was n't insulting you .
COLIN: Well I thought you were , and fo that you have to take me to dinner .
MADOLYN: Maybe you could shoot someone and I 'd have to see you professionally .
COLIN: Whatever it takes . I 'll sta someone in the heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you .
BILLY: You guys from Providence ?
PROPRIETOR: What have you done to my place ! Get out of here .
COLIN: You also do probation work , right ?
MADOLYN: That 's right . I see `` violent offenders '' .
COLIN: Bad guys .
MADOLYN: That 's one way to look at it . Not necessarily .
COLIN: That have this and they do n't have duck l'orange .
MADOLYN: Was your dinner OK ?
COLIN: Oh , the lobster was excellent . I just thought , French restaurant
MADOLYN: I 'm waiting for you to make you move .
COLIN: I do n't know what you 're gon na do , ut if it moves I 'm going to arrest it .
MADOLYN: Why , does that make you uncomfortable ?
COLIN: Yes I do .
MADOLYN: If you actually do I 'll see you again .
COLIN: Who says I want to see you again ?
MADOLYN: Do n't you ?
COLIN: Yes , course I do . What Freud said about the Irish is We 're the only people impervious to psychoanalysis .
MADOLYN: Some people do get better .
COLIN: Fair enough .
MADOLYN: Sometimes , though , I want people to forget about their personal ullshit and do their jobs .
COLIN: Including the criminals ?
MADOLYN: If they do n't do their jobs you do n't have one .
COLIN: Me ? I 'd just arrest innocent people . I 'll arrest you right now .
MADOLYN: You 're trouble .
COLIN: You do n't know the half of it .
COSTELLO: Do you know who I am ?
BILLY: No .
COSTELLO: You met my friend , Mister French the other night .
BILLY: Is his real name Mister French ?
COSTELLO: No . Come with me . I 'm not the cops . I 'm not askin ' you .
BILLY: Is it something I ca n't do personally ?
COSTELLO: I 'm going to have my associate search you .
BILLY: Search me ? Search me for what ?
MISTER FRENCH: C 'm here .
COSTELLO: Contra-fucking-band . Take you fuckin ' shoes off .
MISTER FRENCH: Shoes off .
COSTELLO: I knew your father .
BILLY: Yeah . He 's dead .
COSTELLO: I 'm sorry . How did he go ?
BILLY: He did n't complain .
COSTELLO: That was his problem .
BILLY: Who said he had a fuckin ' problem .
COSTELLO: I just said he had a fuckin ' problem . There 's a man could have een anything .
BILLY: Are you saying he was nothing ?
COSTELLO: I 'm saying he worked at the airport .
MISTER FRENCH: He 's clean .
COSTELLO: The arm .
BILLY: No .
COSTELLO: You swear on your mother 's grave that you 're not a cop .
BILLY: I am not a cop .
COSTELLO: You stop doing coke deals with you jerk-off cousin ?
BILLY: Yes !
COSTELLO: Take it easy . Get your hand taken care of . I 'm sorry . It was necessary . As for our problem with Providencelet 's not cry ove spilled guineas .
JIMMY: Ah , she 's on her way out .
COSTELLO: We all are . Act accordingly .
MISTER FRENCH: These days , who 's reliable ?
COSTELLO: His Uncle Jackie was .
MISTER FRENCH: The Costigans are talented in general .
COSTELLO: You do n't trust a guy behaves like he 's got nothin ' to lose .
MISTER FRENCH: I 'm reliable .
COSTELLO: Well , you 're one in a million .
MISTER FRENCH: Ten million .
COSTELLO: What about your wife ?
MISTER FRENCH: I thought she was .
COSTELLO: She was n't .
MISTER FRENCH: She got reliable .
GWEN: Do n't you people ever shut the fuck up ?
COSTELLO: `` Another county heard from . ''
MISTER FRENCH: One too many .
COLIN: The principles of detection tell me that these men came from Providence .
LYNN DETECTIVE: I 'd appreciate it if you got out of my crime scene .
COLIN: This is my crime scene , but knock yourself out .
COSTELLO: Who 's the lead detective ? Good , he 's a moron .
COLIN: In the trunk or the glove box ? All right .
COSTELLO: Have a seat , Billy .
BILLY: Thank you .
COSTELLO: You know John Lennon ?
BILLY: Yeah , he was president before Lincoln .
COSTELLO: Lennon said ` I 'm an artist . You give me a fuckin ' tuba and I 'll get you something out of it ' .
BILLY: I 'd like to squeeze some fuckin ' money out of it .
COSTELLO: Smart mouth . Too bad .
DIGNAM: That was quick . He dead already ?
COLIN: This will get Captain Ellerby on the six o'clock news .
BARRIGAN: No wonder you get ahead .
BILLY: I wo n't do it if I have to wear a wire . No wires . Ever , ever , you understand me ? You do n't know what this is like . Micro what ?
QUEENAN: Microprocessors . We 'll probably be at war with the Chinese in twenty- odd years and Costello is selling them military technology . Microprocessors , chips , compute parts . Anybody says anything about anything like that , you let us know .
REPORTER: Did you have a tip from an informant ?
ELLERBY: No , it was tireless police activity that ah effected ah the arrest of the ah alleged perpetrator .
COLIN: I 've been put in charge of this unit . It is a small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine . And I did n't take this job in order to fuck it up , or to let anyone else fuck it up , whosoever they may be . I hand picked this group . You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly .
BROWN: Really ?
COLIN: Yeah . Really .
BROWN: Do we have direct access to Queenan 's undercovers ?
COLIN: No . Ahnot presently . Not presently . But I 'm hoping to get thingsreorganized . That 's it . Congratulations . Do n't disappoint me .
BARRIGAN: I know why I 'm here . I made him feel guilty . Why are you here ?
BROWN: Intelligence and aptitude .
BARRIGAN: That 's new .
COLIN: Hello Dad . I have a new job .
MISTER FRENCH: Where 's your fucking license ? I do n't see no fucking license .
BOOKIE: What license .
MISTER FRENCH: There 's no such thing as a license , of course , but you definitely have to have one . If you are not being run by us you will be run by someone else , which means you will have let undesirable elements into Mr. Costello 's area .
HARD GUY: I was going for my fucking cigarettes
MISTER FRENCH: Hey , that 's Jimmy Bags . What the fuck you doin ' ?
BILLY: What the fuck . I did n't know .
BOOKIE: There 's no profit if I pay him two grand a week . I 'm in the hole if I pay him two grand a week .
MISTER FRENCH: Then make more money or go out of usiness . This is America . If you do n't make money you 're a fucking douchebag . What are you going to do ?
BOOKIE: Make more money .
MISTER FRENCH: That 's the spirit .
BILLY: Yeah , well . Fuck .
MISTER FRENCH: Do n't worry about it . Guy did n't need need his teeth anyway . Maybe if he was an Eskimo . But in this country we eat a variety of items .
COSTELLO: So ?
BILLY: He was
MISTER FRENCH: Reaching for his cigarettes .
BILLY: Okay ! You gon na give me shit , it was n't no reasonhe put his hand in his coat ! I do n't know if he 's a ookie or what the fuck he 's doing
COSTELLO: Well , you know what the fuck a ookie does ?
BILLY: Pays you .
COSTELLO: Bingo . Anyway , I like a guy who goes around knocking guys teeth out for no reason .
MISTER FRENCH: Forty-eight hours from the time this phone first rings , you take the fucking chip out - like so - and you fucking destroy it . Afte three days a phone ai n't clean . If you use a phone which is not clean , you will have a accident . You neve call us . We call you . You got that ?
BILLY: I got it .
MISTER FRENCH: I ca n't fuckin ' hear you .
BILLY: I got it .
COSTELLO: They do n't have directional microphones .
BILLY: What , do you got x-ray vision ?
COSTELLO: They do n't have directional microphones .
BILLY: I do n't know .
COSTELLO: Why ? They 're minuses . They ca n't tell the difference between a rock star and a career criminal .
BILLY: Anyone not a criminal is a minus ?
COSTELLO: What are you soft ? That 's not what I said . Eat something , Jesus Christ , we got a nice day by the water . Sun 's shining , gulls are upNice smell of ozone
BILLY: He never , ah , I mean never ?
COSTELLO: He kept his own counsel . He neve wanted money . You ca n't do a thing with a man like that . Your uncle Jackie needed a lot of money . But even though he got his money from me , he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you . And I think about this .
BILLY: So what are talking about here ?
COSTELLO: Fact is you 're not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and I do n't see you up the dog track as a general manager .
BILLY: Look at it this way . It 's like a tuba . I want to see if I can get something out of it .
COSTELLO: You ever think of going back to school ?
BILLY: With all due respect , Mr. Costello , school 's out .
COSTELLO: Well that 's your problem . Maybe someday you 'll wake the fuck up .
PRIESTS: Good morning , Francis , good morning .
COSTELLO: You recall our chat ? `` I am as God made me '' , was that what you said ? May I remind you , God do n't run the bingo in this archdiocese .
YOUNG PRIEST: May I remind you , Mr. Costello , that pride comes before the fall .
COSTELLO: What comes before the Fall is the Summertime .
COLIN: I 'm not making enough progress with Costello ?
ELLERBY: `` Progress '' is hard to define . I make progress every day . In fact , I 'm making progress now . There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result . It 's like any American industry . Nobody minds if you do n't succeed as long as you do n't fuck up .
COLIN: Jimmy Pappas .
ELLERBY: And what happened to Jimmy Pappas ?
COLIN: He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital . I believe it 's been in the papers .
ELLERBY: Are you happy with this result ?
COLIN: It 's a result .
ELLERBY: Yeah , but cui bono ? Who benefits .
COLIN: Cui gives a shit . It 's got a bow on it .
ELLERBY: I think you are a cop , my son .
BRIAN: No , please
FRENCH: Brian , stop it , I ai n't gon na hurt you .
QUEENAN: Hey . Let 's go through the routine .
DIGNAM: You think you can pop someone . There 's no special card to play . The guy whose jaw you broke was Boston Police Department .
BILLY: I 'm going fuckin ' nuts . I ca n't be someone else every day .
DIGNAM: Most of the people in the world do it every day . What 's the big deal ?
BILLY: I 'm not them .
DIGNAM: You 're nobody . You signed the paper . We 're the only people in the world who know that you 're a cop . Maybe we 'll just erase you file .
BILLY: Maybe I 'll fucking kill you .
QUEENAN: Easy now . That was a joke , Billy .
DIGNAM: Just because you play a fucking tough guy does n't mean you are one , you lace curtain fucking pussy .
QUEENAN: Be smart . If someone was watching how are we supposed to not arrest you ?
BILLY: When are you going to take Costello ? What 's wrong with taking 'em on any one of the million felonies you 've seen him do . Get him for pissing in the street .
DIGNAM: Well . That would stick
QUEENAN: You shut up . We 're building a case . It takes time . You know that .
BILLY: There 's something wrong .
QUEENAN: Maybe . Maybe .
DIGNAM: Keep your ears opened . No ullshit .
QUEENAN: I want you to listen for any chatter about a spy in the Special Investigation Unit . You hear anything like that ?
BILLY: Are you serious ?
QUEENAN: I 'm afraid so .
BILLY: Jesus H. Christ .
QUEENAN: Hang tight for me . Just a little longer . We 're this close .
BILLY: Okay .
QUEENAN: Thank you , Billy
COLIN: What have you got ?
BROWN: Uniform clipped him on the Pike fo a suspended licence . However , as he 's the subject of an open investigation
COLIN: At least one . He 's one of Costello 's crew .
BROWN: we 're entitled to get a warrant . We ca n't get an address off him . He paged his lawyer but the lawye has n't called back yet .
COLIN: Who 's the lawyer ?
BROWN: He did n't know the name . He just had the number on a card . Beepe number .
COLIN: Did he beep him ?
BROWN: Twice .
COLIN: All right .
BROWN: What ?
COLIN: Give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off . Who 's is this ? I 'm gon na take this .
BROWN: He ca n't do that , can he ?
BARRIGAN: He just did .
COLIN: Mr. Fitzgibbon , afternoon .
FITZY: You my attorney ?
COLIN: What do you think ? Did you make any statements or phone calls I need to be aware of ?
FITZY: I beeped you . The card they gave methat 's it .
COLIN: That 's it ? Do n't you have to call your mother and tell her you 're not gon na be home for supper ?
FITZY: Mum , I 'm not gon na make it fo supper . I got held up . Yeah , talk to you later .
MISTER FRENCH: Everybody out . Move .
FITZY: Who are you ? When do I get out of here ?
COLIN: I think you need another attorney , after all , Mr. Fitzgibbon . Have a nice day .
BROWN: Why 'd you use my phone ?
COLIN: Because you did n't go in there .
MADOLYN: The light 's nice here in the morning .
COLIN: I got ta go to work .
BILLY: It 's like confession . Is n't it . This sort of thing .
MADOLYN: I know they do .
BILLY: People are liars . They want to be stars of their little films .
MADOLYN: That 's an interesting observation .
BILLY: Do you lie ?
MADOLYN: Why do you ?
BILLY: I 'm asking if you lie .
MADOLYN: Honesty is n't synonymous with truth .
BILLY: You lie . So , is it to do some good , to get somewhere personally , o just for the fuck of it ?
MADOLYN: I expect sometimespeopledo it to keep thingson an even keel .
BILLY: So , you had a parent who was a drunk ?
MADOLYN: Did you ?
BILLY: No .
MADOLYN: Let 's keep this with you .
BILLY: There was a cop leaving when I came in .
MADOLYN: How do you know he was a cop ?
BILLY: Bad haircut , no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement . You see cops ?
MADOLYN: That 's part of what I do . Although , I do n't normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy .
BILLY: You should get a better job
MADOLYN: Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they 've had touse their weapons .
BILLY: Let me tell you something . They signed up to use their fuckin ' weapons . Most of them . But they watch enough TV so they know they have to `` weep '' after they use thei weapons . No one 's more full of shit than a cop . Except a cop on TV .
MADOLYN: I looked through your file and I see you have a record of assault . What was it like for you in jail ?
BILLY: You want to hear about the showers ?
MADOLYN: Did something happen to you ?
BILLY: No . You sit there with a mass murderer , your heart-rate jacked , you handsteady . That 's one thing I found out about myself in prison . My hand does n't shake , ever .
MADOLYN: What do you expect from coming here ?
BILLY: I have to come here .
MADOLYN: I know it 's not electiveon you partbut , now that you 're here , what do you want ?
BILLY: You want the truth ? Valium .
MADOLYN: If you lied , you 'd have an easie time getting what you wanted .
BILLY: What 's that say about what you do for a living ?
MADOLYN: Look , I think we better have a few more meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions .
BILLY: I 'm having panic attacks . You did n't even ask about that . Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack . I puked in a trash barrel on the way in here , I have n't slept for weeks .
MADOLYN: Is this true ?
BILLY: Yes . I said something true . I want some fucking pills and you close my file ? I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here .
MADOLYN: Yes , you are .
BILLY: If only fuckin ' here .
MADOLYN: You can leave !
BILLY: What if that was a legitimate threat ? .
MADOLYN: Fuck
BILLY: Because you 're bored and tired and do n't give a shit . It 's not supernatural .
MADOLYN: Look , I 'm not justsomebody you have to see or they put you in jail . If you are in distress I will help you .
BILLY: What 's this ?
MADOLYN: My card . And a prescription fo twenty Lorazepam .
BILLY: Is it enough to kill myself ?
MADOLYN: Maybe it is . All right ? Have I done my job up to your goddamned standards ? Because by my standards you fit the model of drug-seeking ehavior , and fuck you if you do n't like my initial clinical reaction .
BILLY: Thank you .
MADOLYN: I 'm transferring you to anothe counselor .
BILLY: You wan na get a cup of coffee ?
ELLERBY: All right , let 's bring it in , please . Come in please . Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors . Yes , those . I do n't know what they are . You do n't know what they are . Who gives a fuck ? Cash will be handed over in a building which we have under AV surveillance . Staff Sergeant Sullivan 's team Will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones .
COLIN: Did you guys know anything about this ?
ELLERBY: How long have we been tapped on this building ?
COLIN: Go find out what we 're doing and get on it .
ELLERBY: Sorry to get you at the last minute . But things leak . This lead came from Queenan 's undercover guy .
COLIN: Dad ?
COSTELLO: Too bad . Your mother worked all goddamned day . We 'll just have to sit down without you and you friends .
COLIN: Oh , my friends are still coming .
QUEENAN: The readiness is all . You know the players , call the game .
COLIN: Thank you , Captain .
GEEK COP: Piece of cake . I 'll operate the cameras . You ID the guys and log them .
QUEENAN: All cellphone signals are unde surveillance through the courtesy of our Federal friends ove there

BROWN: Who are they meeting ?
ELLERBY: I do n't know . Some Chinamen from points unknown . They 're already inside .
COSTELLO: Turn off your cell phones .
CAMERA COP: Maybe if we had some Homeland security money like some othe fucking douchebags I could mention
QUEENAN: Any calls ?
ELLERBY: Search randomly for calls made from the area .
ELLERBY: Narrow the area .
LAZIO: What you see for coverage is what you get .
DIGNAM: Why the fuck did they turn off their phones ?
QUEENAN: The buyers are there .
ELLERBY: You know , direct access to you fucking guys would have certain fuckin ' advantages .
QUEENAN: Not to my guy .
DIGNAM: This is unbelievable . Fuck it , who put the cameras in the fucking place ?
DIGNAM: I 'm the guy who does his job . You must be the other guy .
QUEENAN: Hey , hey , hey
COSTELLO: How you going , Robert ?
CHINESE TRANSLATOR: Tops , Mr. Costello . I want to tell you that at least two of these gents have machine guns .
CHINESE GANGSTER: Waiting , waiting . We almost departed ! This man is from the Embassy . He will have to blow his ains out if he is captured . His entire family will be killed .
CHINESE TRANSLATOR: He 's a little upset .
COSTELLO: Tell him light on the starch .
CHINESE TRANSLATOR: He 's fronting the Chinese government and he 's just scared shitless .
COSTELLO: Government man . I 'm concerned about Chinamen who think it 's wise to bring automatic weapons to a business transaction .
CHINESE GANGSTER: Ngup , Ngup , Ngup . Ngaw um ming . Kay ngup mutt .
COSTELLO: For his own good , tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons because here , in this country , it do n't add inches to your dick . You get a life sentence for it .
CHINESE GANGSTER: Put away that machine gun .
COSTELLO: If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan any time in this century , you tell them they better shape up fast and show me one million dollars .
CHINESE GANGSTER: Nay tiey ching chaw yut bok mon . . ALTERNATE/ALSO Ne dei yeeche ling ngnaw dong maw gok nay chun . [ Next time you make me wait , I 'm going to cut your dick off .
COSTELLO: In English , thank you , also .
CHINESE GANGSTER: Du ne .
COSTELLO: The expedition continues this way .
ELLERBY: Do n't tell me those cars were empty . Please do n't tell me those Chinamen 's cars were empty . Do you have a camera in the back .
COSTELLO: See , no surveillance here . They did n't figure we had a navy . Always figure an exit for you usiness partners . What with everything all dug up , you ca n't trust a slant to find the Mass Pike and , with or without Staties out front , frankly I do n't approve of orientals driving to begin with .
BILLY: What about us , Frank ? What 're we gon na do ?
COSTELLO: We depart . We did n't commit no illegalities .
MISTER FRENCH: Except sell the ching chongs a unch of fuckin ' plastic .

MADOLYN: It 's pretty serious , yeah , it is .
BILLY: A head case or anything ? I 'm just curious

ELLERBY: Congratulations . Have n't seen a guy like you since me . You 'll be transferred to Internal Investigations but you will continue to work right where you are in the Special Investigation Unit .
COLIN: I do n't get it .
ELLERBY: We are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole in the Special Investigation Unit .
COLIN: Right .
ELLERBY: You 'll investigate . Everybody . Anybody .
COLIN: Well , that 's just a dream job for a cop .
ELLERBY: We have considered all possible candidates . You have an immaculate ecord . Some people never trust a guy with an immaculate record . I do . I have an immaculate record .
COLIN: No .
ELLERBY: That 's a pity . Pretty much sucks as a game but you get to form elationships . How 's the wedding coming along ?
COLIN: Everything 's great . On schedule . She 's a doctor .
ELLERBY: Outstanding . That 's good . Marriage is an important part of getting ahead . You do n't want anyone thinking you 're a homo . Married guy seems stable . People look at a wedding ring and think someone can stand the son of a bitch . Ladies see the wedding ring and know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock works .
COLIN: Oh , it 's working . Overtime .
ELLERBY: I 'm glad to hear that .
MISTER FRENCH: Boss wants your real name , you social , your license number , all your bank account numbers .

DELAHUNT: Put the forms in there .
FITZY: I do n't know if this is how you spell Citizens ' .
BILLY: No , no , no . Jesus Christ .
FITZY: What are you , retarded ? That ai n't ight .
DELAHUNT: Billy , he said to stay here .
BILLY: I 'm not sitting in this room without a tetanus shot . I 'm not staying .
MISTER FRENCH: Where you going ?
ONSCREEN: Follow the envelope .
BILLY: Why ca n't Ellerby 's guys ? SIU .
QUEENAN: They ca n't . They are compromised .
COSTELLO: Oh yeah , be dirty .
COLIN: Jesus Christ , Frank , I almost shot you .
COSTELLO: You 're not indulging in self abuse are you ?
COLIN: Frank , we got problems .
COSTELLO: I hope you 're not turning into one of those sob sisters , who wants to get caught . You 're not crackin ' up are you ?
COLIN: I do n't crack up .
COSTELLO: Pick a place where any cop could see you
COLIN: Why did you show up then ?
COSTELLO: I own the place .
COLIN: Why am I not fuckin ' surprised . Look
COSTELLO: You 're gettin ' reassigned .
COLIN: How the fuck did you know that ?
COSTELLO: Where 'd they put you ?
COLIN: I have to find myself .
COSTELLO: You 're telling me , sonny boy .
COLIN: I have to find the guy you have in the department .
COSTELLO: With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself , I put my money on nobody finding nothing .
COLIN: Frank , for me , you 've got to lay low .
COSTELLO: Laying low is not what I do .
COLIN: Yeah , big fuckin ' daddy Frank . Lookit , Frank , what good am I to you if you do n't listen to me ? Queenan 's compartmentalizing . He 's fuckin ' smart , you know that . I will find this rat if you let me do it my way . If you let me do my job .
COSTELLO: Okay . But Colin , I hope I wo n't have to emind you , that if you do n't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can give him a halo , most likely it wo n't be me who pays for it .
COLIN: Why would you need to remind me of that ? I did n't know that would I e any good at what I do ? Trust me , I know how to do this .
COSTELLO: Maybe it 's because it 's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theatre .
BILLY: Your name 's on the pill label . I thought you were n't supposed to be in the book , in case of obsessive patients .
MADOLYN: How obsessive are you ?
BILLY: Medium .
MADOLYN: Are you okay ? Why are you here ?
BILLY: I really liked our conversations . I 've beenregretting that we did n't continueou conversations .

BILLY: No . No . What does that matter ?
COSTELLO: Depends . I 'm sure you know by now there 's an informer in my crew . Cop . Staties or Boston Police department , I 'm not sure .
BILLY: What about the FBI .
COSTELLO: It ai n't . Trust me . The ex-wife , an old friend or stupidthat 's what brings you down in this usiness .
BILLY: StupidWell , that leaves me out .
COSTELLO: Past days , case like thisI killed everybody who works for me .
BILLY: Better safe than sorry , I suppose .
COSTELLO: On the other hand , back then , it was only fiveor sixand French .
BILLY: I look around at your guys . They 're all murderers right ? I think `` could I do murder ? '' And all I can answer myself is , `` what 's the difference '' .
COSTELLO: Give em up to the Almighty . Like that .
BILLY: Yeah , that 's my point . You accuse me once , I put up with it . You accuse me twice , I quit . If you make me fear for my life , I put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else .
COSTELLO: You got something you want to say to me , William ?
BILLY: You 're seventy fucking years old . One of these guys is going to pop you . As for running drugs , what the fuck . You do n't need the pain in the ass , and they 're going to catch you . And you do n't need the money .
COSTELLO: I have n't needed `` the money '' since I took Archie 's milk money in the third grade . Tell the truth , I do n't need pussy any more , but I still like it .
BILLY: Is there something you want to ask me , Frank ?
COSTELLO: Start with , you agree there is a at ?
BILLY: You said there is one . I base most of what I do on the idea that you 're pretty fucking good at what you do .
COSTELLO: Sure , sure , all that asidebut you Bill , what would you do ?
BILLY: How many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled ? Who needs more money than you pay them ? You do n't pay much , you know . It 's almost a feudal fuckin ' enterprise . The question is , who thinks that they would do what you do bette than you ?
COSTELLO: Only one that can do what I do is me . You want to be me ?
BILLY: I probably could be you . I know that much . But I do n't want to be you .
COSTELLO: Heavy lies the crownsort of thing .
MISTER FRENCH: Francis .
BARTENDER: We 're out of here , Mister Costello . You 'll have to set the alarm .
COSTELLO: Thank you , Jimmy . See you tomorrow .
COLIN: No .
COSTELLO: Nothing about drugs . Nothing about new guys , nothing about Gloucester ?
COLIN: No , Frank , not a thing . And I promise you I would have heard about it .
COSTELLO: You 're sure . No other departments , no codes , like that
COLIN'S VOICE: Frank . You can relax on this one .
COSTELLO: Okay , Collie . I will .
COLIN: Morning .
DIGNAM: Yeah , I run rat fucks like you . I do n't like them .
COLIN: The day you would n't take a promotion , you let me know . And I would n't even have a job if you did yours .
DIGNAM: Fuck yourself .
COLIN: I need to know the identity of you undercovers .
DIGNAM: Blow me . Not literally , there 's no promotion in it for ya .
COLIN: Morning , Captain .
QUEENAN: Look who 's here . The Queen of the prom .
COLIN: They are not happy with me . Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam .
QUEENAN: What do you expect ? Everybody knows you 're assigned here to find Costello 's rat . They want to find the leak as much as you do . What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat .
COLIN: Fair enough . Well one of them has to be dirty , We know that , right ?
QUEENAN: Two days ago , my undercover guy in Costello 's organization
COLIN: Who is that ?
QUEENAN: Lots of luck . You can go over my head , high as you like . You still wo n't get an answer .
COLIN: Fair enough .
QUEENAN: As I said , two days ago , my guy nearly found out who Costello 's rat is . He lost him in the street .
COLIN: Really ? Did he get a look at him ?
QUEENAN: No .
COLIN: Nothing that could help us ?
QUEENAN: Nah .
COLIN: Any advice ? Generally ?
QUEENAN: Costello ca n't do business without coordinating with his source Who is here . In SIU . Follow Costello and you 'll find his rat .
COLIN: This is Sullivan . I need constant surveillance on Captain Queenan , starting right now .
MADOLYN: What 's going on ?
COLIN: Nothing . Nothing . There 's nothing going on . Just thinking .
MADOLYN: Okay , all right . And what about money ?
COLIN: I got some money . Anothe cityI 'm thinking that .
MADOLYN: Another city ? It 'd be a clean slate .
COLIN: I want you to know you do n't got ta stay . If we 're not going to make it , it 's got to be you that gets out . I 'm not capable I 'm fuckin ' Irish , so I 'll deal with something being wrong for the est of my life .
MADOLYN: Not a bad idea , another city .
DELAHUNT: Of course I know how to spot a cop .
FITZY: Oh yeah , how 's that ?
DELAHUNT: If he 's not paying attention to us , he 's a cop .
FITZY: Lot of fucking cops .
DELAHUNT: She 's probably the fucking Police Commissioner .
COSTELLO: You can get out of here . This is the crew for tonight .
BILLY: I thought I was on for that .
COSTELLO: I changed my mind . Take the night off . Jimmy , get the mop .
MISTER FRENCH: Go out the back . Some guys answe the questions right . Some do n't .
DELAHUNT: You 're a cop .
BILLY: Huh ?
DELAHUNT: You 're ignoring us . You 're a cop . We 're guessing who cops are . Most good looking women are cops .
BILLY: Right . I 'm going home . He 's playing with his new boys .
DELAHUNT: See you later .
BILLY: Later .
DETECTIVE 1: Can I ask a question , Sergeant ?
COLIN: Yes , go ahead .
DETECTIVE 2: Why the fuck are we following Captain Queenan ? To find out about the good Catholic life ?
COLIN: I have to follow every lead , however unlikely , however fucking painful it might be to you delicate fucking sensibilities .
DETECTIVE 1: Who says I have delicate sensibilities ?
COLIN: I have reason to believe that Queenan is Costello 's informer . Follow him , and do n't get made .
DETECTIVE 1: Copy that , Sarge
DETECTIVE 2: Sarge , we got the target .

BILLY: I told you , he 's got dope coming in , I do n't know where . He 's getting spooky , Captain
QUEENAN: What do you mean ?
BILLY: He 's crazy . I just saw the man . He had blood all over him . I ca n't get any more information for you . I ca n't trust it . He 's not including his regular guys I 'm telling you , he 's gon na find out who I am . He 's gon na fuckin ' kill me , I know it .

DETECTIVE 1: What the fuck is going on ?
DETECTIVE 2: Holy fucking shit . Looks like Queenan 's meeting with all of them .
COLIN: Yes .
BILLY: They 'll be on the elevators , too .
QUEENAN: Take the back fire escape .
BILLY: What 'll you do ?
QUEENAN: I 'll be fine . If you get made I ca n't protect you . Go down the fire escape . Now . That 's an order . I 'll e fine .
FITZY: I guess we 've had enough of this shit . Where 's your boy ?
DETECTIVE 1: Fuck ! Something came off the roof .
COLIN: What came off the roof ? What do you mean something came off the oof ? Go again with that information .
FITZY: You 're fuckin ' late . Where the fuck were you ? Get in the fuckin ' van .
BILLY: What the fuck happened ? I came to meet you .
DETECTIVE 1: Stay in the fucking car . Stay in the fucking car . This is a surveillance unit . Do I pursue .
COLIN: No . Stay where you are . I need some fucking information here . What came off the building ?
DETECTIVE 1: I 'm not sure .
DETECTIVE 4: Thirty-two X to CP . Thirty-two X to CP . We 're being fired upon . I epeat .
FITZY: And where the fuck were you ?
BILLY: Boss told me to go home .
FITZY: Maybe he did and maybe he did n't . At any rate you were n't fuckin ' home .
BILLY: I was in a fucking grocery store with no signal . When I got a signal I got the call . What the fuck do you want . Was I there or was I not there ? Huh ?
DELAHUNT: Two daystwo days ago the Boss says to me , it 's been ten years already , and you 've never done me wrong . He asked me , if one of the other guys is a rat , would I take him out . I told him I would but I do n't know if I would . Now I know I ca n't . I 've done a lot of bad things but I 've never been a murderer .
BILLY: When you 're dead it makes no difference where they put you .
DELAHUNT: You know what I thought today ?
BILLY: What 's that ?
DELAHUNT: Who did n't show up today is the at .
BILLY: Yeah , so ?
DELAHUNT: You never been late in your life . And when I called you I made a mistake . I gave you the wrong address . But you showed up at the ight one .
FITZY: That cop was tough . We were excessive with the cop .
BILLY: He 's dead . I 'm going home .
ELLERBY: Do you know why Queenan went to that building ?
COLIN: No .
DIGNAM: A better question is why you fuckers were following him .
COLIN: I told Internal Investigations to follow him .
DIGNAM: Why ?
COLIN: That 's internal Investigations usiness .
DIGNAM: That 's a fucking lie .
COLIN: Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam here have information on this undercover , and othe informants , in a locked file . I need those files unlocked .
DIGNAM: I do n't have the password . Why do n't you come down to the garage
COLIN: That 's a lie .
DIGNAM: No one calls me a liar . Especially when I 'm lying .
ELLERBY: Everybody shut up . Work with the tech guys to unlock the files . Dignam . You take a leave of absence .
DIGNAM: Leave of what ?
ELLERBY: Queenan 's dead . That makes me you oss .
DIGNAM: I 'll hand in my papers first .

COLIN: You 're crazy , Frank . You killed the guy who has all the information . And Dignam 's not in the office , he 's gone . He resigned .
COSTELLO: I do n't give a fuck about Dignam .
COLIN: He 's fucking gone . They took his papers in . He 's not talking . I do n't know where he is .
COSTELLO: Do n't get your balls in an uproar , Collie . That Irish piss-ant wo n't e a problem . He 's so hot for me , we give him a whiff of my ass , he 'll crawl right in it . Let 's give him a whiff .
COLIN: I will .
COSTELLO: Do n't worry . I 'll take care of it .
GWEN: Are you sure it 's me or all that talk about whiffin ' and crawlin ' up asses ?
COSTELLO: Hey , watch your fucking mouth .
GWEN: You watch it .
COLIN: Yeah .
BILLY: You called this number on a dead guy 's phone . Who are you ?
COLIN: So it is you . Thank God you 're all ight . We were very worried .
BILLY: Who are you ?
COLIN: You 're talking to Sergeant Sullivan . I 'm taking ove Queenan 's unit .
BILLY: Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it .
COLIN: Staff Sgt . Dignam has taken a leave of absence . He 's very upset . We 're all very upset . The best thing would be for your to come in . We need you to come in .

What the fuck is a marsh ? And who walks their dog in a fuckin ' marsh ? In three feet of water ? I do n't believe it . I still do n't believe he 's a fuckin ' cop .

MADOLYN: It 's not a joke , it 's a human eing .
COLIN: What ?
COSTELLO: One of us was going to have to die . It tends to be the other guy .

COLIN: What is this , a citizen 's arrest ? Blow me , prick . Only one of us is a cop , here , Bill . Nobody knows who you are . Nobody knows who you are .

BILLY: You erased me ?
COLIN: Go ahead . Shoot a cop , Einstein . See what happens .

BROWN: Shit
BARRIGAN: Did you think you were the only one he had ? Costello was going to sell us to the FBI . It 's you and me now . We have to take care of each other . You understand ?
COLIN: All right . Give me that .
COLIN: At that time , Trooper Barrigan , who I now understand to have been Francis Costello 's informer in SIU , intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head . At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan 's undercove weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location . I attempted to subdue Troope Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol . I was able to wrestle the weapon away , at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me . I was able to get off a single shot , striking Barrigan in the head . I then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired .
COLIN: What about the baby ?
NEUROLOGIST: She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli in a non-specific manner , but occasionally her responses are specific , though inconsistent . He eflexes are primitive and often the same , regardless of stimuli presented
MATT: Yeah , sure . Put her on .
MS. HAYASHI: We just do n't think these photographs are appropriate for Scottie to be sharing with her classmates . Some of them went home quite disturbed , and we got some angry calls from parents .
MATT: Yeah , she 's sort of been going to town with the whole picture-taking thing , ut I had no idea
MS. HAYASHI: I ca n't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family , but Scottie just has n't been herself . Principal Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would e better for Scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time .
MATT: Home . See , I would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her you know , keep he occupied . I would n't really know how to
MRS. THULL: Mr. King , we see this every day children acting out at school when something 's wrong at home . And you family is facing a devastating crisis . Have you been engaging Scottie in eally talking about what 's going on ? Encouraging her to express he feelings ? That 's crucial .
MATT: Oh , yeah . Yeah . Absolutely .
MS. HAYASHI: Scottie , that is not a good choice ! Are you making a good choice ?
MATT: Yeah , Scottie , come on . Knock it off .
SCOTTIE: I 'm a photographer , Dad , a real photographer .
MATT: No , you 're not . You 're overdoing it is what you 're doing .
SCOTTIE: I saw it in a book . Some famous photographer lady took pictures of he mom in the hospital while she was dying , and they 're considered art . That 's what I 'm doing .
MATT: First of all , your mother 's very sick , ut she 's not dying . Second , you do n't share personal stuff like that with strangers . What 's going on with Mom is private .
SCOTTIE: I 'm hungry . Can we get burgers ?
MATT: No .
SCOTTIE: Can we get smoothies ?
MATT: No . As Scottie continues
SCOTTIE: I do n't know what to say .
MATT: Tell her a story .
SCOTTIE: I do n't have a story .
MATT: Tell her anything . Tell her what 's een going on in school .
SCOTTIE: She never cares about that .
MATT: I do n't believe that . What about afte school ? She 's always driving you around the island . You know , gymnastics ? Soccer ?
SCOTTIE: I do n't do those things anymore .
MATT: Ballet ? Piano ? Hula ?
SCOTTIE: Nope .
MATT: If you 're not going to say anything to your mother , we might as well leave .
SCOTTIE: Okay . Let 's go .
MATT: How about this ? Write her a letter .
SCOTTIE: What would I write ?
MATT: I do n't know . `` Get well . Wake up . I love you . Do n't leave me alone with my idiot Dad . ''
MATT: Goddammit , Scottie , stop fighting me on everything .
SCOTTIE: But it does n't make any sense .
MATT: You know what your mother is hearing ight now ? You refusing to talk to her . Is that what you want ?
MATT: We 're not leaving until you talk to her . I 'll even give you privacy . Recite her the alphabet for all I care . What do you want to drink ?
SCOTTIE: Sprite .
MATT: OK , Sprite . Diet Sprite ?
SCOTTIE: Not diet . Regular . Do you think I 'm fat ?
MATT: No , you 're not fat .
SCOTTIE: I 'm not the model .
MATT: It 's just that all that sugar makes you cranky .
SCOTTIE: I 'm not cranky !
MATT: Okay . I 'll be right back . Talk .
NURSE JOY: Mr. King , how are you ?
MATT: Fine , Joy , fine . And you ?
NURSE JOY: I see your picture in the paper today . Have you made your decision yet ?
MATT: My decision ?
NURSE JOY: Your family . About your big land . The other NURSE nudges Joy to be more polite .
MATT: Well , it 's not really my decision . It 's my whole family 's decision . And furthermore mind your own business , young lady . As he turns away to continue down the hall
SHOPKEEPER: Hey , they all the same cards . You like uy all the same cards ?
MATT: These are inappropriate for a hospital gift shop . This girl is underage . Why do you sell postcards like this ? This is a hospital . These are n't get-well cards .
SHOPKEEPER: You like buy all the cards ? Or you want I put them back ?
SHOPKEEPER: Okay , you buy underage girl all fo yourself .
MATT: Scottie , what are you doing ?
SCOTTIE: I 'm hungry . Can we go ?
MATT: You did n't talk to her , did you ?
SCOTTIE: Yes , I did .
MATT: What did you tell her ?
SCOTTIE: It 's private .
MATT: You 're lying . And Jesus Christ , enough with the goddamn texting ! Give me that phone ! Give it here !
SCOTTIE: Bye , Mom !
MATT: How can I help you ?
MATT: Yeah , no , I get it . I 'm very sorry .
SCOTTIE: I do n't know !
MATT: Is that what you text all the time , nasty things ?
SCOTTIE: No .
MATT: Well , what then ?
SCOTTIE: I write them with Reina . They make he laugh , and then she shows Megan and Brooke , and they laugh too .
MATT: I should have known Reina had something to do with it . I do n't want you hanging out with her .
SCOTTIE: Wait , I told Reina she could visit me in the hospital since I 'm not in school anymore . Can she ?
MATT: We 'll make a deal . You apologize to this girl , and you talk to your mother , and then we 'll see about Reina dropping y the hospital . Okay ?
SCOTTIE: Dorks ! Matt looks to see
MATT: Scottie , knock it off !
SCOTTIE: Her house is down there on the corner .
MATT: You 've been here before ?
SCOTTIE: Yea-uh . She invites me to he irthday , like , every year .
MATT: So you guys are actually friends ?
SCOTTIE: Until last year 's party , when she locked me out of the house and I had to sit outside all day while everybody was inside . She thought she was so great , ut then I became friends with Reina and Brooke and got popular .
MATT: What ?
BARB HIGGINS: Thank you for coming by .
MATT: Scottie , do you have something you want to say to Lani ?
SCOTTIE: Sorry .
LANI: It 's okay .
MATT: Great . Well , nice meeting you both . Lani , you should come over sometime . Come for a swim or a hike or something .
BARB HIGGINS: Scottie , the things you said were simply evil . Do you realize that ? I do n't know what 's led you to be such a nasty young lady .
MATT: Hey , hey . We came over . She apologized . We 're dealing with it . Kids are mean sometimes . They grow out of it . It 's a kid thing . Here , Scottie , you 're going to stop , right ? And you 're really , really sorry , right ? Scottie makes a big exaggerated nod .
BARB HIGGINS: I do n't think she 's sorry at all . She 's going to keep doing it . I can tell .
MATT: No , she wo n't . It 's like the time Lani locked Scottie out of the house at he irthday party and Scottie sat outside y herself . It was a mean thing to do , ut Lani here probably did it just to show off , right ? Lani thinks a moment , nods .
BARB HIGGINS: I did n't know about that .
SCOTTIE: You brought me cake .
MATT: You brought her cake . So , I do n't know , maybe Lani should be the one to apologize , since this incident may have een the catalyst for all this `` evil '' was the word you used .
BARB HIGGINS: Oh , and Mr. King ?
MATT: Yes ?
BARB HIGGINS: Good luck with the sale .
MATT: Big decision .
BARB HIGGINS: My husband 's family is from Kaua ' i . Hanapepe , born and bred . They hope you do n't sell .
MATT: You do n't say .
BARB HIGGINS: All the traffic it 's going to make .
MATT: Are you going to act different with Lani ?
SCOTTIE: I 'll try , but it 's hard . She has a face you just want to hit .
MATT: Yeah .
NOE: Mr. King , your cousins are here .
DR. JOHNSTON: Bad news , Matt . Dr. Chun , Dr. Muelle
MATT: So if we do go ahead and take he off the machines
DR. JOHNSTON: Not if , Matt . When . I have a legal obligation . You know that .
MATT: How long will she last ?
DR. JOHNSTON: Hard to say . Could be a few days . Could be two weeks . But for planning purposes , you should work off the shortest possible scenario . I know I need to get the ball rolling on organ donations right away . Organ donation ? Forgot about that one .
MATT: What 're you doing ?
KAI: Oh , she 's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here , and I just know she 'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush . I know she 'll grill me . Matt and Mark exchange a look `` Girls . ''
MARK: And of course Kai 's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip .
KAI: Well , I do n't want to have to start from scratch later . Oh , and Matt , on the way here we stopped by and left some more meals in your fridge , all eady to nuke .

SCOTTIE: The food here at the club is so good .
MATT: Yeah , they do a good job here .
SCOTTIE: Why is it called a jellyfish ? It 's not a fish , and it 's not jelly .
MATT: No idea . You ask good questions . You 're getting too smart for me , Scottie .
SCOTTIE: I 'm going to find out . Then I 'm going to ask Mom when she wakes up and see if she knows . Do you think she 's going to know everything she used to know ?
TROY: Hi , Matt . Hi , Scottie .
MATT: Troy .
TROY: I 'll catch up to you guys in a second .
MATT: Same .
TROY: I visited her last week , you know . I thought she looked pretty good .
MATT: So why 'd you ask ?
TROY: I do n't know , I just wanted to know the latest . I 'm praying for her every day , you guys . Really hard . Seriously . So what I was saying was , when I was there , I talked to her , and her hand moved , so I was pretty encouraged . I thought that was an encouraging sign . Scottie looks up hopefully . Matt notices .
MATT: That 's enough .
TROY: I really think she heard me .
MATT: Look , Troy , go to your friends . No hard feelings . Let 's just leave it alone . Troy walks away , stops , turns back .
TROY: I told you , Matt , there were lots of chops and holes that day . I told you a hundred times . Ask anybody . What happened to her could have happened to me . It was a super-hard day on the water .
MATT: You were n't supposed to be driving , Troy . She was supposed to be driving .
TROY: She wanted me to drive . And she 's the one who told me to pass the other boat ight before the turn . And just you whole attitude toward me , Matt I mean , I feel terrible . I wish it were me and not her . Plus I almost drowned myself when we capsized . And my otator cuff is never going to be the same , and I 'm going to miss Moloka ' i .
SCOTTIE: Just because her hand moved , it does n't mean anything , Troy . Mom twitches at weird times . When you cut off a chicken 's head , it runs all around , but it 's still a dead chicken .
MATT: Hey , sport , do n't pay any attention to that guy . That guy 's a dope .
SCOTTIE: I hate him .
MATT: Yeah .
SCOTTIE: I did n't mean to say dead chicken . I do n't want Mom to die .
MATT: I know , I know . Hey , let 's get out of here . Let 's go do something crazy . Like let 's drive to the airport and hop over to the Big Island and surprise your sister . What do you say ?
SCOTTIE: Right now ?
MATT: It 'll be fun . She 's not expecting us or anything . And we bring her home . I think she should be here with us , do n't you ? Do n't you miss her ? I miss her .
SCOTTIE: Yeah , I 'm out of school . She should be too !
MATT: Hi , sorry to bother you . I 'm Matt King .
DORM SUPERVISOR: Yes , hello , Mr. King .
MATT: I 've come to pick up my daughter , Alexandra .
DORM SUPERVISOR: Did you call Administration ?
MATT: No , I did n't . It 's sort of an emergency .
DORM SUPERVISOR: All right , let 's see what we can do .
SCOTTIE: Which door ? Which door is it ?
MATT: Scottie , keep it down !
DORM SUPERVISOR: Will you both keep it down ? It 's around the corner .
MATT: Sorry , Yuki .
DORM SUPERVISOR: Wake your roommate , sweetie .
ROOMMATE: Um Alex is n't here .
DORM SUPERVISOR: Where is she ?
ROOMMATE: I think she 's outside somewhere .
DORM SUPERVISOR: Girls ! What do you think you 're doing out here ?
EMILY: Run !
SCOTTIE: Hi , Alex ! It 's me , Scottie !
MATT: You know , I pay $ 25,000 year for this crap not to happen . Alex !
ALEXANDRA: Dad ? My fucking dad is here !
DORM SUPERVISOR: You do n't talk like that here . This is unacceptable behavior !
ALEXANDRA: What 's up , Dad ?
EMILY: You come out to play a few holes with us ?
SCOTTIE: We came to get you so you can come home . He took me out of school already . I have n't gone for three whole days .
ALEXANDRA: What 's happening ? Why are you here ?
MATT: You need to come home and see Mom .
ALEXANDRA: Fuck Mom !
DORM SUPERVISOR: What did I say about the language ?
SCOTTIE: I do n't like eggs .
MATT: Why did n't you say so before I made them ?
SCOTTIE: I thought they were for you .
MATT: Good morning . Does Mom let you have Coke fo eakfast ?
ALEXANDRA: I 'm pretty sure it 's after eleven .
MATT: How are you feeling ? Shrugging , she plops down near Scottie .
SCOTTIE: I do n't mind .
MATT: I thought you were supposed to be getting your act together .
ALEXANDRA: I have gotten my act together . I was just drinking . I 've been doing really well , but nobody ever seems to notice my grades are better , and how I was in that stupid play you guys did n't bothe to see . Do you even remember the name of it ?
MATT: Hey , hey , hey . Watch your language in front of Scottie .
SCOTTIE: I 'm okay .
MATT: Anyway , it 's good to see you . Welcome home . Want some eggs ?
ALEXANDRA: How long do I have to stay ?
MATT: We 'll discuss that .
ALEXANDRA: I 'm going swimming .
MATT: Then I 'll join you .
ALEXANDRA: Good times .
MATT: He comes you know , I do n't know what day he comes .
ALEXANDRA: Awesome .
MATT: Who 's Sid ?
ALEXANDRA: A really good friend from Punahou . We were in school together for years .
MATT: Oh . Okay .
ALEXANDRA: He wants to be there for me with all this shit happening .
MATT: Do I know his parents ?
ALEXANDRA: No . He might stay over too . Is that cool ?
SCOTTIE: Ooo , la la ! Do n't I look divine ?
MATT: Scottie , get back inside and change into your swimsuit .
SCOTTIE: Why ?
MATT: Now . Scottie flips him off and runs back inside .
ALEXANDRA: Real good job you 're doing .
MATT: That 's part of why I brought you here . You have to help me . I do n't know what to do with her .
ALEXANDRA: Maybe if you spent more time with her , she would n't act like such a complete spaz . Get her out of town go camp on Kaua ' i . That 's what mom did with me whenever I was losing it .
MATT: Listen , Alex , your mother is n't well .
ALEXANDRA: Obviously .
MATT: They just told me she is n't going to wake up . It 's for sure now . The doctors are going to stop caring fo her . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? Your mom wanted it this way . Alex remains silent .
ALEXANDRA: Why 'd you have to tell me in the goddamned pool ?
MATT: Alex Alex
ALEXANDRA: What do you want ?
MATT: I just found out yesterday . We have to go through this thing together , you and Scottie and I . And I need to go around and tell people what 's happening ou family and close friends . Sometimes I 'll want you to come with me . Othe times I need you to watch Scottie .
ALEXANDRA: You want me to go around with you and tell everyone that Mom 's going to die ? What 's the point of that ? Breaking the news , watching them cry , dealing with their emotions . How depressing is that going to be ? Just call them .
MATT: Alex , nobody wants to do any of this . But we need to tell Grandpa and Tutu , a few friends . They have the right to know and to be able to say goodbye .
ALEXANDRA: I do n't want to talk about Mom with anyone .
MATT: Whatever you fought about with her at Christmas , you need to drop it . Grow up . You love your mother . Your mothe loves you . Move on .
ALEXANDRA: I ca n't drop it .
MATT: You have to .
ALEXANDRA: You really do n't have a clue , do you ? Dad , she was cheating on you . Whoa .
MATT: Caught her with some guy ? What does that mean ?
ALEXANDRA: Brandy and I were on our way to swim in the Black Point pool , and suddenly I see Mom and some douchebag walk into a house . His house , I guess .
MATT: Just a guy ? It could have been anybody .
ALEXANDRA: He had his hand on her ass . It was gross .
MATT: You 're sure it was her . Then what ?
ALEXANDRA: Then nothing . She went into the house . A few days later I told her I knew what she was doing .
MATT: And ?
ALEXANDRA: First she acted like she did n't know what I was talking about . Like I 'm lind . Then she got super-mad and started yelling at me and denied it . That 's when I decided I did n't want anything more to do with her .
MATT: Who is he ?
ALEXANDRA: I do n't know . Some guy .
MATT: What did he look like ?
ALEXANDRA: Dark hair .
MATT: Watch Scottie .
MATT: Hello ! It 's me , Matt !
KAI: Oh , hey , Matt .
MATT: You guys were n't sleeping , were you ? As they come downstairs
KAI: No , we were just fighting . Come on in . Want a drink ? Want some coffee ?
MATT: What were you fighting about ?
MARK: Stupid .
KAI: It 's not stupid . He wants us to throw parties and have people over , which we do , of course , but who ends up doing all the work ? Me .
MARK: It 's work that 's totally unnecessary . You do n't have to do anything . Nobody 's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail . We can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out . It 's more fun that way , anyway .
KAI: Shit , Matt . Is Elizabeth is there any news ?
MATT: In fact there is . I 'll tell you in a moment . Who is he ? Does she love him ? Who is he ?
KAI: Matt .
MATT: I 'm sorry to put you in this position . But I 'm not really the one who put you there , am I ? I just want to know who this guy is that my wife has been seeing .
KAI: Oh , Matt , you 're angry .
MATT: You could be a therapist . Very keen powers of observation .
KAI: Wow . I think we should talk anothe time . I think you need to cool it .
MATT: Is it Troy ? That fucking Neanderthal ?
MARK: You do n't know him .
KAI: Oh , do n't you even , Mark . Shame on you . You 're her friend .
MARK: I 'm Matt 's friend too . And this is a very unique and dramatic situation . I 'd want to know .
KAI: Do n't betray her when she ca n't even defend herself . Matt , you may not be able to hear this right now , but it 's not her fault . Women have needs .
MATT: Are you fucking kidding me ?
KAI: Your marriage was not You worked so hard to make partner , and no one can take that away from you . But then you made partner , and you only got busier . And it 's not like you were so involved with the girls . She was lonely .
MATT: So you 're going to talk to me in clichés about women ? Nothing is ever a woman 's fault . Was it still going on when she had the accident ? Kai looks away . Mark nods .
MARK: But I stayed out of it , Matt . Anytime Kai talked about it , I walked away .
MATT: And you what ? You probably egged he on . Add some drama to your life without any actual risk . Whom do you think you 're protecting anyway ? She does n't need your protection it 's over . She 's going to die .
KAI: Do n't say that .
MATT: I almost told you yesterday . She 's never going to wake up . It 's for sure now . You hear me ? We 're pulling the plug . You were putting lipstick on a corpse .
MARK: Come on , Matt . That 's a little intense .
MATT: I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to take it out on you guys . I just Does she love him ?
KAI: How can you ask about him when she 's going to die ? Who cares ? Yes , she loves him , loved him , whatever . She 's crazy about him . She was going to ask you for a divorce .
MATT: You still have n't told me who he is . I guess it does n't matter . Matt rises to his feet and leave .
MARK: Brian Speer . His name is Brian Speer . Two e 's . A PET GOAT tied up in the front yard watches .
SCOTTIE: Hi , Daddy .
ALEXANDRA: Dad , this is Sid .
MATT: Hello , Sid .
SID: ` Sup , bro ?
MATT: Do n't ever do that to me again . Get ready , okay ? We 're going to Grandma and Grandpa 's . Auntie Esther will come over to watch you .
ALEXANDRA: Sid 's coming with us , okay ?
MATT: Sid , this week , what 's going on , is a eal family matter . You understand . Sid 's not going to be interested in meeting your grandparents . He 'll be ored stiff .
ALEXANDRA: Dad , I told you he was going to be with me . I 'll be a lot more civil with him around .
SID: What can I say ?
MATT: Does he know what we 're doing ?
ALEXANDRA: He knows everything .
SID: Dude , your wife is dying and then you find out she 's been stepping out on you ? That 's harsh .
MATT: Get in the car .
SCOTT THORSON: This is like reading Korean .
MATT: Scott , I 'll be happy to walk you through it .
SCOTT THORSON: Jibber-jabber .
MATT: It 's an advanced directive basically her instructions on what medical procedures she wants or , in this case , does not want . No prolonged mechanical ventilation , no
SCOTT THORSON: I know goddamn well what it says . Says she does n't want everyone waiting around while she spoils like milk . Says if the doctors ca n't do squat , she 'd just as soon get on with it . He stares off into space .
ALEXANDRA: Gramps , are you okay ?
SCOTT THORSON: Elizabeth had the good sense to write this thing here . Always a thoughtful girl . A strong girl . A hell of a lot stronger than her brother . Barry whines his way through life . Might even be a homosexual , for all I know .
MATT: Yeah , Scott , I do n't think so .
SCOTT THORSON: And she 's stronger than you , Matt . She lived more in a year than you did in a decade , sitting in your office , hoarding all your cash . All that money you refuse to use what the hell good is it ? And now you and your family are cashing in your chips what the hell for ? Maybe if you 'd let my baby have her own boat and bought her some safe equipment or let her go on those shopping sprees women like , maybe she would n't have gone in for those thrill sports . Maybe if you 'd provided more thrills at home .
ALEXANDRA: Grandpa .
SCOTT THORSON: And you , Alexandra . Putting your poo mother through hell when all she was trying to do was instill some sense and drive in you . Shame on you . You should try to be more like her . She 's a good girl . She 's a good girl .
ALICE: Oh , do we have guests ?
MATT: Hi , Alice . Good to see you . It 's me , Matt .
ALICE: Good to see you too .
ALEXANDRA: Hi , Tutu .
SCOTT THORSON: That 's Alexandra .
ALICE: Hello .
SCOTT THORSON: She 's your granddaughter . And this is your son-in-law Matt . This is you family . Well , except this kid . I do n't know who the hell he is . Who are you ? Why are you here ?
ALEXANDRA: He 's my friend .
SID: Good afternoon .
SCOTT THORSON: Alice , we 're going to go to Queen 's Hospital today and see Elizabeth .
ALICE: We are ? Queen Elizabeth ? That 's wonderful . I 've never met a queen efore . I have to put on a nice dress . Sid bursts out LAUGHING .
SID: Is she serious ?
SCOTT THORSON: You be quiet , son . No , Alice . Our Elizabeth . Our baby . We need to go visit her in the hospital . She needs us , just like when she was a little girl . Let 's think about what she might want in her room . We 'll take it to her and put it next to her bed .
ALICE: But she 's a queen . I have to look good for a queen . Do n't you want me to look good ?
SCOTT THORSON: Shut up , Alice . Sorry , old gal . You go ahead and say whatever you want .
ALICE: I 've never met a queen before .
SID: I 'm sorry , man . I was just laughing . It 's funny . I think she knows she 's eing funny .
SCOTT THORSON: I 'm going to hit you .
MATT: How 's the eye ?
SID: That was unreal . I mean , how often do old people just haul off and fucking cold-cock you in the face ?
MATT: He 's hit me a couple times over the years . And watch your language .
ALEXANDRA: Here , let me kiss it .
SID: Ow !
MATT: Hey , could you two just cool it around me ? You know , stop touching each other so much ?
SID: Whoa ! Maybe that 's why your wife cheated on you , if you 're so against touching .
MATT: You little fuck . Do you get hit a lot ?
SID: I do n't know . I 've had my share .
MATT: Your friend is completely retarded . You know that , right ?
SID: Hey , my little brother 's retarded . Do n't use that word in a derogatory fashion .
MATT: Oh .
SID: Psych ! I do n't have a retarded other !
ALEXANDRA: You suck , Sid .
SID: Speaking of retarded , do you ever feel ad for wishing a retarded person or an old person would just hurry up ? Sometimes I wait for them to cross the street , and I 'm like , come on already ! But then I feel bad .
ALEXANDRA: Dad ?
MATT: What ?
ALEXANDRA: Do n't forget I know where he lives . Matt thinks a moment , then
MATT: Get in the front seat .
ALEXANDRA: Do you know anything about him ? Like what he does or if he 's married ?
MATT: Just his name . Brian Speer .
ALEXANDRA: Why did n't you ask Kai and Mark ?
MATT: I just did n't .
ALEXANDRA: Why not ?
MATT: I did n't want to get into it .
ALEXANDRA: We 'll google him later . Okay , there it is . Stop .
MATT: There ? He lives there ?
ALEXANDRA: Well , I ca n't say for sure he lives there . That 's just where I saw them .
MATT: And you just happened to be driving by .
ALEXANDRA: Sadie was driving . We both saw it .
SID: That house is a piece of shit . At least go after a guy who 's got a mansion . And do you think he 's married ? That 'd be pretty cold-blooded to do it in a house where you 're married .
ALEXANDRA: Sid , please be quiet .
MATT: What are we going to do ?
ALEXANDRA: I do n't know . I 'm just showing you the house . They all think a moment .
MATT: No , wait , this is stupid this stalking , or whatever the hell we 're doing . We came , we saw . Whatever . Let 's go . No one moves .
ALEXANDRA: It 's not like we 're stalking him exactly .
MATT: I guess I just want to see him .
SID: All I know is , someone messed with my girl , all hell would break loose .
ALEXANDRA: Whatever , Sid .
SID: I mean , you 'd never do that to me , would you ? You know , if we ever got married . Fuck around on me .
ALEXANDRA: Depends on how you treated me .
MATT: That 's enough now .
ALEXANDRA: And we 're not getting married . Jesus .
MATT: Okay , that 's enough . We 're getting out of here .
ALEXANDRA: Dad , stop !
MATT: What ?
ALEXANDRA: Go back .
MATT: Why ?
ALEXANDRA: Just go back a couple of houses .
MATT: There who is ?
ALEXANDRA: Look .
SID: Must be pretty handy for a dude having an affair to have some empty houses at his fingertips . I 'm just saying . That 's how I 'd do it .
MATT: None of your business . And put some clothes on . And you 're not sleeping in Alex 's room . In fact , you should eally go home , son .
SID: Alex would n't like that .
MATT: Guest room . Take it or leave it .
SID: We 're going to do what we 're going to do .
MATT: I 'm not going to make it easy for you .
SID: I 'm just fooling with you , man . We 're not like that . Guest room 's awesome . Just call him . He 's nobody . Raise hell .
MATT: Yeah , hi , Brian . My name 's , uh , He Fitzmorris . I 'm interested in that house you 've got on Koloa Street , the one with the plantation shutters . I 'm at 645-2796 . Thanks .
SCOTTIE: Hi , Mom ! Look who 's here .
ALEXANDRA: Hi , Mom .
SCOTTIE: Tell her how you were drunk the othe night . Tell her maybe you 're an alcoholic .
ALEXANDRA: I guess it 's in the genes .
MATT: Girls , be serious .
ALEXANDRA: Hi , Mom . Sorry for being bad . Fo wasting your money on expensive private schools . Money you could have used on facials and massages and sports equipment . Sorry for everything . Sorry we were n't good enough for you especially Dad .
MATT: Stop it . That 's out of line .
ALEXANDRA: Or what ? You going to ground me ? O ship me off to another boarding school ? You going to give me a `` time out ? ''
MATT: Goddammit !
SCOTTIE: You got served !
MATT: Scottie , out in the hall .
SCOTTIE: She 's the one out of line .
MATT: Go find Sid .
SCOTTIE: He 's smoking . I should n't be around second-hand smoke .
MATT: Now ! As Scottie runs outside
ALEXANDRA: Did you just spank me ?
MATT: You have no right to talk to you mother that way . She 's going to die in a few days . What if those were you last words ?
ALEXANDRA: I have every right to speak this way . I 'm mad at her . How can you be so forgiving ?
MATT: I 'll be angry later . For now let 's just think about the good parts .
ALEXANDRA: Look , Mom , I know we fought a lot . But I always wanted to be like you . I am like you . I 'm exactly like you . God , that came out so dramatic .
MATT: You are like her . Mostly in good ways . Maybe some bad ways . Remains to be seen . Sid saunters inside with Scottie in tow .
SID: I hear you got spanked . I hear all hell 's breaking loose in here . Hey , Mrs. K. , howzit ? I 'm Sid , Alex 's friend from Punahou , remember ? Nice day outside . No clouds . Not too hot . You know what I think ? Tough lady like you ? I think you 're going to make it . I mean , I 'm no doctor . What do I know ? But that 's what I think . Matt squints at Sid . Is he stoned ?
SCOTTIE: Reina just texted me ! She 's here visiting her grandma ! Can she come visit ?
MATT: Dammit , Scottie , no Reina .
SCOTTIE: But you said Thursday , and it 's almost Thursday . I do n't get to see her in school anymore .
MATT: Not now .
SCOTTIE: I need her . Alex needs Sid . I need Reina .
REINA: Hi , everybody .
SCOTTIE: If you want .
REINA: No , thanks .
MATT: So , Reina , I hear your grandmother 's not feeling well .
REINA: Yeah . It 's pretty bad . She got he stomach operated on and then got some stupid infection or something . It 's pretty gross .
MATT: Well , Reina , thanks for stopping by , and , here , Scottie , let me give you some money , and you two can go get an ice cream or something
REINA: Too many carbs .
MATT: Carbs . Well , you could go to the cafeteria and get some lettuce .
REINA: That 's okay . I 'm done . You are n't a liar after all .
SCOTTIE: Do n't you want to hang out ?
REINA: No , I should go . I 'll see you at the club . Hope your mom gets better . Exit Reina .
ALEXANDRA: Scottie , what 'd she mean by `` You are n't a liar after all ? '' What 'd she think you were lying about ?
SCOTTIE: She did n't believe Mom was sleeping .
ALEXANDRA: So you had to prove to that twat that Mom 's in a coma ? What the fuck is in your skull , a bunch of stupid pills ?
SCOTTIE: Shut up , you motherless whore !
SID: Whoa , whoa , easy there , half-pipe .
MATT: Where 'd you learn how to talk like that ? Scottie points at Alex .
ALEXANDRA: Hello ? No , you 've got the right number . This is his assistant Sharon . How may I help you ?
SCOTTIE: Who is it ?
ALEXANDRA: Oh , I see . And for how long ? Uh-huh . Okay . So one or the other . I 'll tell him . Mahalo .
BUZZ: Hi , Mr. King .
MATT: Hello , Buzz .
BUZZ: Sorry about Mrs. King . Hope she gets etter real soon .
MATT: Thanks .
BUZZ: It really blows .
MATT: I wo n't .
BUZZ: Sometimes I steal beers from you outdoor fridge .
MATT: I know . Buzz slinks off .
ONE GUEST: Can we see her ?
MATT: Yes , for God 's sake , yes . That 's the whole point . Go see her as soon as possible . That 's what I wanted to tell you . It should be now , not after . Everyone who loves her deserves a chance to say goodbye .
ALEXANDRA: You mean him ? Tell him to say goodbye ?
MATT: I 'll only be gone a day or so . I 'll leave in the morning , and be back tomorrow night . If it takes anothe day , fine I 'll give it two days tops . If I do n't find him , at least I tried .
ALEXANDRA: Drop it , Dad . You 've got way bigge fish to fry than confronting fucking Brian Speer . Are you recording this ?
MATT: I 'm summarizing a deposition .
ALEXANDRA: How can you work ?
MATT: How can you go to a movie ?
ALEXANDRA: To get Scottie out of the house . And you 're going to tell him to come back and see Mom .
MATT: I think I just think she would want him to know .
ALEXANDRA: Just call his office and say it 's an emergency .
MATT: On the phone he can escape . In person he has nowhere to go . I want to see his face . I want to change his life .
ALEXANDRA: Then I want to go too .
MATT: No , you stay with Scottie .
ALEXANDRA: Fuck that . Let 's all get out of town .
MATT: Just came over for a day or two .
COUSIN RALPH: Yeah , I just got back from Kahului . A little business over there .
MATT: Yeah .
COUSIN RALPH: All right . So you here to talk to some of the cousins ? Make sure everybody 's happy with your choice ? Pay you espects to Cousin Hugh ?
MATT: No , no , nothing like that . Just a little holoholo . Get the kids out of town .
COUSIN RALPH: But it is Holitzer , right ? We all know it 's Holitzer . Cousin Hugh wants him , they go way back . I got my misgivings , though . It 's not the highest bid by a longshot .
MATT: Yeah , no , I know . I want to work with you guys , Ralph , I really do . Whateve the majority wants , I 'll go along with it . Let 's just get it over with .
COUSIN RALPH: How 's Elizabeth doing ? She going to be okay ?
MATT: The same .
COUSIN RALPH: Well , she 's a tough gal . She 'll be okay . Yeah . Say , where you going , Hanalei ?
MATT: Yeah , Princeville .
COUSIN RALPH: Come on . I 'll give you a ride .
MATT: Hey , Ralph .
COUSIN RALPH: Yeah .
MATT: Turn off over here . Let 's go see the land .
COUSIN RALPH: Take a last look , huh ?
MATT: You got time ?
COUSIN RALPH: I got nothing but time .
RALPH: I think this is where a golf course is going to be . They want the golf course to rival Pebble Beach , you know , bring in the big boys .
SID: Are you shitting me ? You guys own all this land ?
MATT: Not personally . It belongs to a trust . But yeah , it 's ours for a few more days .
RALPH: The other side of that ridge too . You ca n't see it from here . It 's like this , but a little flatter and does n't have as nice a bay .
SID: This is outrageous .
COUSIN RALPH: Yep . Big resort there on that point . Commercial area over there , houses all through there . I think they should put in a big zip-line . Hell , we should have put in a zip-line .
RALPH: Of course , part of me agrees with the cousins who do n't want to sell . They 're going to make a pretty big stink at the meeting .
MATT: I know , but we have to sell . The trust has to dissolve in seven years , and if we have n't sold , it 'll be a huge mess . Selling now and distributing the cash is the only clean way to do it .
RALPH: But it 's a shame , yeah ? On the othe hand , hey , it 's just sitting there . No one 's using it . At least this way the whole world will be able to enjoy it .
MATT: Take a good look , girls . In the old days , this was part of your great-great grandmother 's inheritance going all the way back to Kamehameha I .
ALEXANDRA: Down there is where Mom and I would camp .
MATT: We all did , all our lives . A lot of memories .
SCOTTIE: What about me ? I want to camp . I wish we lived in the old days .
ALEXANDRA: We do . We still do . Do we really have to sell ?
MATT: Doing anything else would get extremely complicated . A lot of your cousins just want the money . Everything has its time .
SCOTTIE: I want us to keep it !
SID: Can you like specify what businesses they 'll put here ? Because you should totally get a Cheesecake Factory . Only one so far 's in Waikiki , and it 's awesome . You definitely need a Cheesecake Factory . And Taco John 's .
MATT: My grandfather . He really loved this place . So did your mother . So does your mother .
CLERK: Here 's your credit card back , Mr. King . And how many keycards will you be needing today for your deluxe suite ?
MATT: Let 's say three . By the way . I 'm supposed to meet a buddy of mine I think is staying here . Brian Speer . S-
CLERK: I 'm not showing anyone by that name .
MATT: Thanks .
MATT: No , I understand . Okay . Thanks .
ALEXANDRA: I could .
MATT: Just got off the phone with Dr. Johnston . They did what they had to do a couple hours ago . They 've moved he to another floor . They say she seems comfortable , still breathing on he own . She 's doing okay .
ALEXANDRA: What do you mean ? You mean considering Mom 's circling the drain ?
MATT: No , I mean other than that . In general . You have n't been using , have you ?
ALEXANDRA: No , Jesus , I 'm not using .
MATT: Not at all ? I smell pot all the time on Sid .
ALEXANDRA: That 's Sid .
MATT: So you just stopped ? Really ?
ALEXANDRA: Look , Dad , it 's no big deal . Kids do drugs and they stop . Unless they 're like super-ghetto . And you sent me to oarding school , remember ? I could n't get anything anymore . So no , I 'm not doing any drugs . But I still think they 're fun . Okay , maybe a little pot once in a while .
MATT: And a little drinking . She ca n't deny that .
ALEXANDRA: Mom 's dying .
MATT: Yeah , well , I 'm proud of you .
ALEXANDRA: Not much to be proud of .
MATT: Yeah , there is . We shipped you off . Let them handle it . And now you 're here , helping with Scottie , helping me . Thanks .
ALEXANDRA: You want to know what really pisses me off ? That she would n't end it . Not even when she knew she was busted . How are we supposed to feel about that ?
MATT: I guess she really liked him .
ALEXANDRA: So how are we going to find this guy , Sherlock ?
MATT: Right . Well , why do n't you two take Scottie to the beach ? I 'm going to call around a little . We 're on an island , for Christ 's sake . Everything 's just one degree of separation .
ALEXANDRA: We 'll find him .
MATT: Hey , what 's in your suit ?
SCOTTIE: They 're my beach boobs .
MATT: Take that out . Right now . Alex , Jesus , why 'd you let her do that ? You too , Sid . Lying on her stomach , Alex lifts her head .
ALEXANDRA: I do n't know . Take them out , stupid .
SID: Yeah , Scottie . Honestly . Big boobs look kind of fatty .
ALEXANDRA: Any luck ?
MATT: The hotels were a dead end , but I took another shot with his office . He 's definitely in Hanalei renting a house somewhere probably one of those cottages around the bay . Who wants to go for a walk ?
SID: Sounds good .
ALEXANDRA: Yeah , let 's go . Scottie !
SCOTTIE: Can we swim with the sharks ? I read in the hotel magazine how they put you in a cage in the ocean and throw shark feed in the water and sharks swim right up to you . Can we do that ?
ALEXANDRA: Scottie , we 're not really here to do stuff like that .
SCOTTIE: How 'd you and Mom meet ?
MATT: I was with a law school buddy from the mainland , and I took him to the club . We were just coming in from paddling , and your mom was on her way out , and she looked at me and said , `` Do you think it 's going to snow today ? '' We all got beers when she came back in . I had already seen her around . That was it . I got her number .
SCOTTIE: Did you think she was pretty ?
MATT: She knocked me out .
SCOTTIE: What do you love about her ?
MATT: I love I do n't know . The way we are with each other , most of the time , anyway . I love how she 's more capable of feeling joy than anyone I 've eve known . I just like being with her , just riding bikes or going out to dinner , even if it 's just a plate lunch at Rainbow 's . Years ago we used to do a lot of paddling together .
ALEXANDRA: Can we drop this ? Jesus . `` What do you love about Mom , Daddy ? '' Shut up , already . And stop babying her .
MATT: Easy , Alex . We 're just talking .
MATT: Your mom got chased by a shark once . Very close call .
ALEXANDRA: When was that ?
MATT: We were on Moloka ' i with Mark and Kai , and your mom was out surfing and saw a shark right beneath her on a wave . Like right beneath her . She got down on her stomach and started paddling like crazy , and this big fin kept following her . She even paddled up onto the nearest rocks instead of all the way to shore . Got cuts all ove her legs and hands . Only time I eve saw your mother scared , and she was eally scared . She even threw up . Crying and shaking . I had to hold he for a long time . She really thought she was going to die . Of course she hid all that from the Mitchells , turned it into a funny `` Me-versus-a-shark '' story . I told her
ALEXANDRA: Yeah ?
MATT: I told her it was n't her time yet . They continue in silence a few moments .
SCOTTIE: I wish Mom was here .
MATT: I 'll ask you that same question , Scottie . What do you love about Mom ?
SCOTTIE: Lots of stuff . She 's not old and ugly like other moms .
ALEXANDRA: Why are we still talking about this ? I like how she 's not afraid of anything .
SCOTTIE: Let 's watch one of these !
ALEXANDRA: We 're not watching porn .
SCOTTIE: Reina 's dad watches pornos . Reina calls them masturbation movies . He dad has some . She plays them when he parents are n't home and one time invited boys over to see if they grew down there . One did .
SID: Reina 's awesome .
MATT: Were you there ? Have you seen any of those movies ?
SCOTTIE: No .
ALEXANDRA: You 've got to watch her with the internet . And Reina 's dad . Scottie , Reina is a fucked-up ho-bag , and you need to stay away from her . Do you want to end up like me ?
SCOTTIE: Yes .
ALEXANDRA: I mean the earlier me , when I was mean to you and yelling at mom all the time .
SCOTTIE: No .
ALEXANDRA: Well , Reina 's going to be a meth-head , and she 's going to get used by stupid guys . She 's a twat . Say it .
SCOTTIE: She 's a twat . Twat , twat , twat , twat !
MATT: Stop that ! I do n't get it . I do n't know what to do these things she does . What goes on in her head ? You were n't like that .
ALEXANDRA: It 'll go away .
MATT: I 'm not so sure . I mean , look how you kids talk in front of me . It 's like you do n't respect authority . Alex looks at him authority ?
SID: Hey , what 's up ?
MATT: Hi .
SID: Checking on me or something ?
MATT: I do n't , uh I have n't been sleeping very much lately .
SID: Understandable .
MATT: I 'm worried about my daughters . I 'm worried there 's something wrong with them .
SID: I used to do some messed-up shit when I was a kid . Still do . It 's going to get worse after your wife dies .
MATT: What does Alex really think about this stuff that 's going on ? What does she say ?
SID: She does n't .
MATT: What do you mean ? I thought she talks to you all the time .
SID: We do n't really talk about our like `` issues . '' We just , I do n't know , we deal with our shit by talking about other stuff and having a good time .
MATT: What would you do if you were me ? How would you handle my daughters ? How would you handle the situation of this guy we 're trying to find ?
SID: I told you what I 'd do I 'd lay his nuts on a dresser and hit ` em with a spiked bat . With the daughters , I do n't know . I 'd take them on a trip . Or no , I 'd buy ` em a bunch of shit . Like with all the money you 're going to get when you sell the land you 're going to make stupid money , right ? dude , you could buy them anything .
MATT: Do you want some of it ? Some money ?
SID: Sure .
MATT: If I gave you a lot of money right now , tonight , would you leave ?
SID: Why would I leave ?
MATT: No , Sid , I 'm asking you a favor . If I give you money , will you leave ?
SID: Oh . I get it . Is that what you want ? You want me to go ?
MATT: I guess not .
SID: Look , dude , you 're right . If I had daughters , I would n't know what to do . Exchange them for sons , I guess .
MATT: Then I might wind up with something like you .
SID: I 'm not so bad . I 'm smart .
MATT: You 're about a hundred miles away from Smartville . No offense .
SID: You 're mistaken , counselor . I 'm smart . I have good hygiene . I 'm an decent guitarist , a good cook . I cook food all the time . I 'm vice-president of the Punahou chess club . And I always have weed .
MATT: I 'm sure your parents are proud .
SID: It 's possible . My mom 's sort of busy ight now .
MATT: What does she do , your mom ?
SID: She 's a receptionist at a pet clinic . But mostly she 's been getting the house together after my dad died . My dad died a few months ago .
MATT: Goodnight , Sid . I 'll see you tomorrow .
SID: Goodnight , boss .
MATT: Hi , you do n't know me , but I know you . Hi , you do n't know me , but I know you . Brian Speer , right ? Hi , I 'm Liz 's husband . That 's right . Fuckface .
JULIE: Stay in the zone , please ! That means you , Skylar . And you too , Colt .
MATT: Skylar and Colt ?
JULIE: Yeah .
MATT: Must keep you pretty busy .
JULIE: They 're pretty non-stop , but they 're at a really fun age .
MATT: How old are they ?
JULIE SPEER: Eight and ten .
MATT: I have two girls . Ten and seventeen . That whole non-stop thing . That neve changes .
JULIE SPEER: You guys live here ?
MATT: We live on O'ahu .
JULIE SPEER: Oh , so do we .
MATT: Yeah , I 'm just getting my girls out of town for a couple days . Their , uh , their mother is in the hospital , so I thought I 'd give them a little break .
JULIE: Oh , no .
MATT: She 'll be fine .
JULIE: What 's wrong ? If you do n't mind my asking .
MATT: Just a little boating accident . Hit her head a little too hard .
JULIE: A sailboat ? Or one with a motor ?
MATT: One with a motor .
JULIE: Well , good luck with that . I wish he well . Skylar , do n't go so far !
MATT: You guys staying in one of the cottages over there ?
JULIE: Yes , my husband had to come here fo work , so we thought we 'd all make a little vacation of it . He knows the owner , so
MATT: Hugh King .
JULIE: That 's right .
MATT: He 's my cousin .
JULIE: Oh . Then you probably know my husband . Brian Speer ?
MATT: No , ca n't say as I do .
JULIE: Oh , I just assumed , since he 's been
SCOTTIE: Dad ! Dad , come here ! Something bit me !
MATT: Excuse me . Nice talking to you .
JULIE: You too . Take care . Matt trots off .
COUSIN HUGH: yucking it up at the BAR with other REGULARS .
MATT: There 's Cousin Hugh . Get us a table . Order me something .
ALEXANDRA: Like what ?
MATT: Anything .
COUSIN HUGH: Heeey ! Mattie-boy ! What are you doing here ? I did n't expect to see you until the meeting .
MATT: Yeah , Scottie and Alex .
COUSIN HUGH: Big girls now ! So what are you doing here , man ?
MATT: Just getting the girls out of the hospital for a couple days , you know , change of scenery .
COUSIN HUGH: Yeah , boy , what you 've been going through . That 's a tough deal . But Elizabeth , hey , she 's , she 's a tough gal , I 'll tell you that . A fighter . She 'll make it . Get you a drink ?
MATT: Sure , what 're you having ?
COUSIN HUGH: Barney , an old-fashioned for my cousin here . Nice to see you , Matt . How you een otherwise ?
MATT: Not much otherwise . Between ou usiness and the hospital , you know , I 've just trying to keep my head above water . So listen , I see you have some people staying in the cottage .
COUSIN HUGH: Oh , hey , Mattie , if I 'd known you were coming , I coulda
MATT: No , no , no , I 'm just wondering about the guy you 're renting to . I think his name is Brian Speer .
COUSIN HUGH: Yeah , yeah , real determined son-of-a- itch . He 's Lou 's sister 's No , wait . Lou has a sister , and the sister 's husband Lou 's brother-in- law is cousins with that guy .
MATT: Huh ? Who 's Lou ?
COUSIN HUGH: No , wait . You mean the cottages on the ay or the cottage back by the trail ?
MATT: The bay . The guy with the wife and two oys .
COUSIN HUGH: Yeah , that 's right . Determined son-of- a-bitch . Anyway , the point is the guy we 're doing business with is that guy 's other-in-law . Works for him .
MATT: Brian Speer .
COUSIN HUGH: That 's the guy .
MATT: What do you mean , the guy we 're doing usiness with ?
COUSIN HUGH: Who do you think ? Don Holitzer .
MATT: Holitzer .
COUSIN HUGH: That 's what I 'm saying . That 's Don 's other-in-law in the cottage . You do n't know him ? I would have thought you 'd know him . He 's a realtor over by you . So if we sell to Don and that 's what we 're going to do , right ? That 's what you want too . Nice guy , Don . He 'll do right by us . Then when Don develops and re-sells and leases and all that
MATT: Yeah , yeah
COUSIN HUGH: He 's letting this brother-in-law in the cottage handle the transactions . A lot of them , anyway . Big score for that guy .
MATT: What 's he like ?
COUSIN HUGH: Who ?
MATT: Brian Speer what else do you know about him ?
COUSIN HUGH: Not much . He 's lucky . The bugga 's lucky . His sister is married to the guy . Son-of-a-bitch is going to make a shitload of money on commissions .
MATT: Not if we do n't go with that bid .
COUSIN HUGH: We all want Don . You do too , Matt . You 've said as much .
MATT: No , I know . You 're right . Okay . Well . Good to see you , Hugh .
COUSIN HUGH: You too .
MATT: See you at the meeting .
COUSIN HUGH: I 'll be there .
SID: This place rocks .
SCOTTIE: Totally .
ALEXANDRA: We ordered you mahi .
MATT: Great . The music grows more frenetic .
ALEXANDRA: Who 's Don Holitzer ?
MATT: The guy we 're going to sell to . And that woman today at the beach . That was his wife .
ALEXANDRA: Whose wife ? The hottie with the hat ? You sure ? So he 's married . Nice . Why did n't you say anything ?
MATT: It 's him I want to talk to , not her . I know where their cottage is .
ALEXANDRA: You do ? So let 's do it right now . Let 's go knock on his door .
MATT: That 's what I 'm saying . Alexandra quietly exults .
ALEXANDRA: Well , it 's what we came here to do .
MATT: So you to talk to his wife while I talk to him . And figure out some way to distract Scottie and their kids .
ALEXANDRA: Got it . Sid , come here !
SCOTTIE: I want to come too .
SID: I do n't . Who wants to sit around talking in some house ? Let 's ditch these losers and go watch some serious
SCOTTIE: Yeah ! As they walk away
SID: Give ` em hell , boss .
ALEXANDRA: Are you ready ?
MATT: No . What should I say ?
ALEXANDRA: You 'll think of something . You 're a lawyer .
MATT: Hi there !
JULIE: Oh , hello .
MATT: Yeah , hey , I 'm such an idiot . I just figured out I do know your husband . My daughter and I were on our way back to the hotel from dinner , and we thought we 'd drop by and say howdy .
ALEXANDRA: Howdy ?
JULIE: Great . Come on up .
MATT: I 'm Matt King . This is Alexandra .
JULIE: I 'm Julie Speer . Yeah , I thought that was you .
MATT: Yeah , no , I know , yeah , super-involved . Maybe I 've met him in passing . I do n't know .
JULIE: So , I guess you guys are deciding eally soon . A couple of days , right you and your family meet ? I 'm sorry . That 's probably a conflict of interest or something .
MATT: No , it 's okay . You 're right it 'll all be over in a couple of days .
JULIE: You guys want a burger ?
MATT: We just ate , thanks .
JULIE: A drink then .
BRIAN SPEER: Hi , I 'm Brian .
MATT: Brian , we may have met before . Matt King . My wife is Elizabeth King . I think you may have met her too . Ou daughter Alexandra . Brian 's big GRIN WILTS .
JULIE: I was just going to get drinks .
BRIAN SPEER: Good , good . Good .
ALEXANDRA: Do you need help ?
JULIE: No , no , I got it .
MATT: Elizabeth is dying . Oh , wait . Fuck you . And she 's dying . We unhooked he from the machines this morning . She 'll e dead in a few days .
ALEXANDRA: We 're not here to hurt you . We just thought she 'd want you to know .
MATT: Beats me . Well , he 's very articulate .
BRIAN SPEER: I ca n't I 'm sorry . I never thought it would come to this .
ALEXANDRA: You 're sorry my mom 's going to die ? You 're sorry you fucked her ? You 're sorry you fucked over my dad ?
BRIAN SPEER: I 'm sorry for all of it .
MATT: Look , pal , like she said , I 'm not here to wreck your life . I just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital . I do n't know how long you 're planning on being here , but I 'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave .
ALEXANDRA: You must be good at that .
MATT: You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want . Do you hear what I 'm saying ?
BRIAN SPEER: Okay , look , I ca n't have you here . You understand .
JULIE: Here we go . Everyone 's so serious . Please do n't tell me you 're talking about business .
ALEXANDRA: We 're talking about love .
JULIE: That 's nice . Brian , call the boys in for dinner .
BRIAN SPEER: They 're fine . Let them play a while longer .
ALEXANDRA: Awesome cottage you 're renting .
MATT: Yeah , say , prime Hanalei location . I used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental . Alex , you great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian uilt it back in the 20s . Have n't been inside in years .
JULIE: Come on . We 'll give you a tour .
ALEXANDRA: Or , Brian , maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane , and Julie and I can chat out here .
MATT: Yeah , I 'd like that , if you do n't mind . Just a quick look .
BRIAN SPEER: Sure . But it 's not like I live here .
MATT: How did you meet ? I 'm curious .
BRIAN SPEER: I ca n't do this .
MATT: Neither can I . How did you meet ?
BRIAN SPEER: I thought you said you came here just to tell me .
MATT: I changed my mind . And I ca n't very well ask her the details . How 'd you meet ?
BRIAN SPEER: At a party .
MATT: What party ?
BRIAN SPEER: Super Bowl party .
MATT: At the Mitchells ' .
BRIAN SPEER: Does that help ? Does that make it etter ?
MATT: Hey , I 'm doing you a favor here . I could go out there right now and fuck you up , so get a better attitude . Then what ? How 'd you get the nerve to ask her out ? Brian drops his head , rubs his temples .
BRIAN SPEER: No , no . It 's not what you think . It just happened .
MATT: Nothing just happens .
BRIAN SPEER: Everything just happens .
MATT: Was she going to leave me ?
BRIAN SPEER: She would have . But I , I , uh I did n't want that . That would n't have happened . I love Julie . Please do n't tell her . Please . I do n't know what I 've done . I 'm sorry .
MATT: Did she say she loved you ? Brian nods slightly .
BRIAN SPEER: No , I told you . I was n't trying to get to you .
MATT: Then I guess it 's all working out . He lips are sealed , and you do n't have to go through the trouble of dumping her .
BRIAN SPEER: Hey , hey , that 's really unfair . I had - - have a lot of respect for her . She 's a wonderful woman .
MATT: Too bad her husband found out . You ca n't win ` em all . One more question . Have you ever been inside my bedroom ?
BRIAN SPEER: Once .
MATT: You could have had the decency to lie about that one . Well , she 's in Queen 's Hospital if you want to say goodbye . That really is all I came to say .
BRIAN SPEER: Should n't you be with her ?
MATT: Yeah , great , all remodeled , new appliances . Nice . Alex , we should be getting back .
JULIE: Well , hey , thanks for stopping by . Really nice to meet you both . Maybe we 'll see you at the beach tomorrow .
ALEXANDRA: Yeah , maybe .
MATT: I have no idea . Sid leans forward from the middle seat .
SID: Was he sorry ? I hope he was sorry , man . You could have told his wife , and you did n't . I hope he knows how lucky he is . I would have told he everything . She deserves to know . O else she 's going to be a dumb bitch the est of her life .
ALEXANDRA: Sid .
SID: I 'm just saying .
MATT: No need to get creepy . Anyway , does n't matter . That 's all behind us .
ALEXANDRA: Yeah , the one we have to worry about telling things to now is Scottie .
MATT: I 've asked Dr. Johnston to help us eak the news tomorrow .
DR. JOHNSTON: Hello , everyone . Matt . This is Dr. Herman , whom I told you about . She works with us in counseling .
DR. HERMAN: Hello , everyone . Hello . Hi . Hello .
SCOTTIE: How come Mom is n't on any more machines ? Is she getting better ?
DR. HERMAN: You must be Scottie . Scottie , I have a present for you .
SCOTTIE: Like what ?
DR. HERMAN: I 've heard that you 're a wonderful and unique and spirited girl .
SCOTTIE: Dad , is that true ?
MATT: Yes , Scottie . It 's true .
DR. HERMAN: You 're going to have to be a very brave girl right now , and you 're surrounded y people who love you . I came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what you 're feeling , I would like to talk to you too . I can help you face what 's going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us .
DR. JOHNSTON: Okay . Thank you , Dr. Herman .
ALEXANDRA: What the fuck was that ?
DR. JOHNSTON: Yes , well , they say she 's very good one- on-one .
SCOTTIE: So Mom 's going to die for sure ?
DR. JOHNSTON: Yes . We worked really hard with her , ut three other doctors and I agree she 's in what we call an irreversible coma . Do you know what that means ?
SCOTTIE: It means she does n't have a brain anymore .
DR. JOHNSTON: Not exactly , but yes , that 's the general idea . So we 're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that eve happened . That 's why she 's not attached to the machines anymore .
ALEXANDRA: It 's for the best , Scottie . Look at her . She 's not happy like this .
DR. JOHNSTON: The purpose of medicine is to heal , and we ca n't do that now .
MATT: Do you understand ?
SCOTTIE: Yes . What will we do with her body ? Dr. Johnston looks to Matt for this one .
MATT: First Mom 's going to give some of he organs to other sick people , so she can help save their lives . That 's a really neat thing she 's doing . Then we 're going to we 're going to scatter he ashes in the ocean . You know how Mom always loved the ocean .
SCOTTIE: Her ashes ?
DR. JOHNSTON: Any day now , I 'm afraid . But you still have some time .
MATT: Thanks , Sam .
ALEXANDRA: Come here , Scottie .
SCOTTIE: Do eyeballs burn ?
SID: Hey , Scottie . Do n't think about stuff like that .
SCOTT THORSON: Here we are . Hi , Bingo . Alex .
MATT: There 's not much left to decide . We 're just sort of playing it by ear and making sure she 's comfortable .
SCOTT THORSON: I mean what did you decide about the uyer ? Who 's your buyer ?
BARRY THORSON: Dad , I 'm sure you 'll be able to read about it in the paper .
SCOTT THORSON: I do n't need to read about it . I can hear about it right now .
MATT: Scott , let 's not talk about that here . It 's not the time for that .
SCOTT THORSON: All the same to you , I guess . A million here , a million there . Just ironic , that 's all Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as you 're coming into a fortune . She gave you everything , Matt . A good , happy home , two beautiful daughters .
MATT: Scott , what 's your point ?
SCOTT THORSON: She wanted her own boat . She should have had her own boat , one she would have been familiar with .
MATT: She was n't even driving ! Her boat , someone else 's boat it would n't have made any difference . You 're not going to blame me for this .
SCOTT THORSON: Sure , sure , quibble about the details . She was a faithful , devoted wife . She deserved more . Why fight it ?
MATT: You 're right . She deserved more .
SID: For Christ 's sake , take it easy on the man .
ALEXANDRA: My father has been doing a really amazing job under the circumstances .
ALICE: Are we ready to go ?
BARRY THORSON: No , Mom . Not yet .
MATT: Girls , Sid . Matt , Sid and the girls quietly go into
SID: Man , that guy 's a prick . Was he always like that ?
MATT: Yep .
SID: Is he praying ?
MATT: No .
SCOTT THORSON: Say goodbye to Elizabeth , Alice .
ALICE: Oh . Goodbye , Elizabeth .
WIDER: Matt alone .
MATT: Elizabeth 's not doing well .
COUSIN HUGH: She 'll be okay . She 's a fighter .
MATT: No . She 's dying . We took her off the machines .
COUSIN HUGH: Well , no surprise . Other than the holdouts who do n't want to sell at all , it 's Don Holitzer . Chicago group a distant second . Feels good . We 're doing the right thing , Mattie . At least there ai n't going to be any Wal-Mart . Now it 's your call , and we 're all behind you , most of us anyway . Go ahead , Captain . Make it official .
MATT: It 's strange , that 's all .
COUSIN HUGH: What 's strange ?
MATT: We did n't do anything to own that land . It was entrusted to us . And now we 're just
COUSIN HUGH: What 're you doing , Matt ? I mean , we know you have a lot on your plate right now , but you 're not going to fuck this up for us . It 's over . If we do n't sell now , it 'll be a mess when the trust dissolves . Just sign , go to you wife , done .
MATT: I do n't want it to go to Holitzer . I do n't want it to go to anyone . I want to keep it .
COUSIN SIX: For Christ 's sake . We ca n't move without your approval . And we do n't want to .
COUSIN HUGH: Your head 's not right , Mattie . You head 's not right . You want a couple days to think it over ? Take a couple days .
MATT: I do n't need a couple days . I have the authority , and this is what I want . I have n't wanted something in a long time . We have other businesses we 're converting to corporations . We can figure it out .
COUSIN SIX: But it 's utterly unproductive land . It does n't generate enough income to pay the goddamn taxes .
COUSIN HUGH: You 're the trustee . You know bette than anyone we only have seven years left .
MATT: Then I have seven years to figure out how to keep it .
COUSIN HUGH: We 'll come after you . Just because you 're a lawyer does n't mean the rest of us would be afraid to come afte you . But nobody wants to do that . We 're family .
MATT: People will be relieved , Hugh , the whole state . I sign that document , it 's over . End of the line . Something that was ours to protect will be gone . Even though we 're haole as shit and go to private schools and clubs and ca n't even speak pidgin , let alone Hawaiian , we still carry Hawaiian blood , and we 're still tied to this land . And ou children are tied to this land . It 's a miracle that for whatever bullshit eason 150 years ago , we own this much of paradise , but we do . And fo whatever bullshit reason now , I 'm the trustee . And I 'm not signing . And if you sue me , it 'll only make us closer .
COUSIN HUGH: All right , everybody , listen up . Cousin Mattie has an announcement . Get eady .
MATT: Julie . What are you doing here ?
JULIE: I know we just met , but I was thinking about you guys these past few days , and I knew your mom was here . I do n't know . I just felt I should stop by .
MATT: You remember Alex . This is Scottie . Sid . This is Mrs. Speer .
JULIE: Julie .
SCOTTIE: Were you friends with my mom ?
JULIE: No , we never met . But I know a lot about her .
MATT: Well , we appreciate your coming by . The flowers are lovely .
SID: Scottie , Alex . Let 's go to the cafeteria .
MATT: I , uh , I 'm not sure how much you know about my wife 's condition , but she 's going to die very soon . Any minute , eally . That 's sort of why we 're all here .
JULIE: I know . That 's why I came . Because I know . I came because my husband would n't . And that just did n't seem ight . I thought someone from my family should come . Wow .
MATT: I 'm sorry I came to your house like that . Just barged in on you .
JULIE: It 's all right . I assume you 're angry . Of course you are . I 'm angry too .
MATT: So he told you , huh ?
JULIE: After you left that night , he was acting really weird . Then I started smelling it all over him . I 'd already smelled it .
MATT: You 're a woman .
JULIE: I finally got it out of him . We 've een going crazy ever since . Not easy with the kids around . It 's all something I never could have imagined . And then your family 's decision about the land . I think you 're doing the ight thing , but Brian is well , it 's all so complicated and confusing .
MATT: I know .
JULIE: Brian told me everything . Well , how can I ever know it 's everything ? When did you find out ? Have you known for a while ?
MATT: Just a few days ago .
JULIE: I 'm angry , but I 'm just so sorry . I ca n't imagine what you 're going through . Do you mind if I say something to her ?
MATT: Okay . All right . That 's enough , Julie . I think I think that 's enough .
JULIE: That 's why I 'm here .
MATT: Goodbye , Elizabeth . Goodbye , my love , my friend , my pain , my joy . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye .
PADDLES: in the water .
SCOTTIE: How far do we have to go ?
MATT: Not that far . Just past the break .
ALEXANDRA: Steer straighter , Dad . And a little faster , okay ?
MATT: I 'm trying .
SCOTTIE: Great .

MRS. BRUCE: The devil 's body count , that 's what 's up ! Do n't you know what KISS stands for ? `` Knights in Satan 's Service ! ''
TRIP: Jam has yet to do an overnight with us .
LEX: I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen . I hope he does n't get grounded again . If he misses Peter Criss 's drum solo , I do n't know if he 'll be able to handle it .
HAWK: Lex , quit trying to always jinx things . Do n't worry , dudes . Nobody 's missing that concert tomorrow night .
JAM: Hello ?
HAWK: Jam , listen up .
JAM: It 's my Bullworker .

JAM: Of course , but has that ever stopped me before ? Besides , my mom 's going to some church meeting and wo n't be ack till late . No sweat See you guys in school . CLICK . DIAL TONE . Jam hangs up .
LEX: Poor , Jam , man . Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers . No question , Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell .
TRIP: You 're one to talk , Lex . Your mom 's a fuckin ' dyke .
LEX: Trip , a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make . And even if it did , at least my mom did n't give birth to me while she was on LSD .
TRIP: Shrooms ! And even if it was LSD , I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day .
HAWK: Both you assholes , SHADDAP ! Lex and Trip shaddap .
LEX: Trip , you fuckin ' asshole .
TRIP: What ? Lex points to a wet mess on the pillow .
LEX: You spilled my Sea Monkeys all ove the bed .
MRS. BRUCE: Jeremiah , what are you doing ?
JAM: Uhh nothing .
MRS. BRUCE: You 're going to be late if you do n't hurry up and change soon .
JAM: Change ? What 's wrong with what I got on ?
MRS. BRUCE: It 's dirty laundry for one thing and for another , you still have n't worn the clothes I bought you . You 're skating on thin ice already , young man , so I would n't push my luck . Now get out of those rags .
JAM: But , mom !
MRS. BRUCE: Besides , those jeans are so tight I can see your penis .
JAM: They 're not idiots .
MRS. BRUCE: Now do n't forget you 're on the hono system tonight . I 'll be home a little after one and if you 've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music well , need I remind you of the consequences ?
JAM: Grounded for the rest of the year ?
MRS. BRUCE: You 're a smart boy , Jeremiah . And so handsome .
TRIP: School . What a fuckin ' waste of time .
HAWK: Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead .
LEX: Stellas . I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs .
TRIP: Same species when you think about it .
GIRL #1: Do n't stare too long , you 'll go blind . The boys quickly cover .
LEX: Yeah , right . She wishes . Look at that big ass .
TRIP: You know what they say about a big ass big shit .
LEX: Shit , that dork is Jam .
TRIP: So , Jam , who did your wardrobe , Tad the preppie sailboat captain ?
JAM: Hey , my mom had me over a barrel , all right . After last night , I had to let her dress me today . It 's a give and take relationship .
LEX: Yeah , she gives you shit and you take it .
HAWK: Okay , enough . Enough . Gim me the tickets . I wan na hold onto them .
JAM: They 're still at my house in Trip 's jacket .
HAWK: They 're what ?
JAM: She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck 's sake .
TRIP: That 's some sick shit right there . Did she comb your ass hair for you too ?
LEX: If your mom so much as smells those tickets , they 're history , and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row , the third year !
JAM: Do n't worry about it . They 're perfectly safe . We can pick them up after school . My mom wo n't be home . It 's no problem .
HAWK: All right . After school we double- time it to your house for the tix efore heading to the train station for the 2 45 to Detroit Rock City .
JAM: Check . The BELL RINGS .
HAWK: As they say in the Tampon biz , see you next period . SLAM ! They shut their lockers in unison .
JAM: Oof ! Sorry .
BETH: No problem .
JAM: Thanks .
BETH: Yes ? BOINK ! The pen hits Jam in the eye .
JAM: Ow !
BETH: No . No problem . Jam points to his eye .
JAM: Just a little pink eye . No reason to panic . Unamused , the teacher goes back to grading .
BETH: Sorry .
JAM: It 's okay .
BETH: Jeremiah ?
JAM: Yeah ? She hems and haw , then
BETH: I wanted to tell you something
PRINCIPAL'S VOICE: Jeremiah Bruce , come to the office immediately
WHOLE CLASS: Oooo , you 're in troubaaaallll .
PRINCIPAL'S VOICE: Your mother 's here and would like to see you right away
TRIP: Holy shit , my jacket !
MRS. BRUCE: I made an appointment with Fathe Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard 's . We 're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot .
JAM: You mean , you 're sending me to b- -boarding school ?
MRS. BRUCE: What else can I do ? Oh , records and magazines and comic books are one thing , but tickets ? TICKETS ? Jeremiah , do you realize what this means ? That you 're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces ! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh . You want to reach out and touch pure evil and in Detroit no less !
JAM: Mom , three of those tickets do n't even belong to me . They 're for the guys .
MRS. BRUCE: And if the `` guys '' have parents who truly love them , they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these blasted things .
LEX: I knew it ! I knew this was gon na happen ! I had a bad feeling since last night . Remember ? We are so totally fucked !
TRIP: Waitaminit , dudes ! I got it ! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together !
HAWK: What are you , high ?
TRIP: Yeah .
HAWK: For once Lex is right . It 's over . Things ca n't get any worse from here .
VOICE: I hope you rodents have hall passes !
LEX: Wan na bet .
ELVIS: Could that be three detentions I smell ?
HAWK: Second floor girls ' john ! Two minutes ! He 'll never look there !
LEX: Check !
HAWK: You 're way out of your league , Elvis .
TRIP: Fuck ! Shit ! Lex sits on the toilet in the stall .
LEX: Hey , take it easy , man . This is the girls ' crapper , remember ?
TRIP: Wake up , Lex ! We just watched Jam 's mom torch our fuckin ' KISS tickets ! Not REO Speedwagon ! Not Journey ! Not the Bay City Rollers ! KISS ! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom , I 'd sure like to hea it !
LEX: Trip , it 's not the end of the world , okay ? Quit acting all squeezed out .
TRIP: Oh , everything 's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would , you snug sonofabitch ! You fuckin ' jinxed us !
LEX: Smug , Trip ! Not snug , smug . Hawk bursts into the bathroom .
HAWK: We 're clear , dudes .
LEX: I 've been in love with her since the second grade .
HAWK: Whoa she just farted .
LEX: I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life .
HAWK: Weird Pause .
TRIP: Peeeyeewww ! That stinks !
LEX: Heh-heh , sorry . He 's gone .
MRS. BRUCE: Someday you 'll have a son just like you , Jeremiah . A boy who lies through his teeth , buys demonic records , and smokes the dope just like you .
JAM: If I 'm anything like you , I 'll deserve him .
MRS. BRUCE: What ? !
JAM: I said , I 'm sorry !
MRS. BRUCE: If you truly are sorry , son , then you better pray like you 've neve prayed before . God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you . He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him fo it .
JAM: Please , God , help .
TRIP: Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this ?
HAWK: Maybe some tunage 'll chase those lues away .
DJ'S VOICE: and this is Simple Simon on the ock of Detroit , W.A.R.P. , home of the biggest KISS giveaway in the history of the universe !
LEX: Too bad we 're stuck in electronics or
HAWK: Never mind with the too bad shit . I got a crazy plan , but only the craziest among us can pull it off .
MR.J: Mr. Verudi , get back to your bench .
TRIP: But I got ta take a piss like you would not believe , Mr. Johansen !
MR.J: Put a clothespin on it till the end of class , Verudi . You know my rule .
TRIP: But ever since my doctor put me on salt pills , it 's been like Niagara Falls every half hour ! Please , Mr. J ! Have mercy !
MR.J: Salt pills ? Do n't insult my intelligence , Verudi
TRIP: Jeezis , I 'm taking a leak in my pants !
MR.J: Get the hell out of here , Verudi ! You disgust me !
TRIP: I need to be connected to the W.A.R.P . contest hotline Now lady ! Hello , is this me ? I 'm Trip .
SECRETARY: Moron .
ELVIS: Why you little ! Over my dead body ! The bell RINGS .
TRIP: I did it ! I did it ! We won !
LEX: We won ? !
HAWK: Fuckin ' A ! Woooooo !
TRIP: This is the best thing that eve happened to me at school ! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit , ut we 're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line ! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario .
HAWK: Stan Lee could n't think of a bette one .
LEX: The Chinese have a proverb `` That which appears too good to be true , usually is . '' There 's got ta be a catch .
TRIP: Yeah ? I have a saying too , Lex . It goes , `` Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us , asshole . '' We 're going this time and that 's all there is to it .
HAWK: I 'm afraid our constipated little friend is right this time , Trip . There is a catch . Hawk 's really got their attention now .
TRIP: Namely ?
HAWK: Our band `` Mystery '' is a quartet and we ca n't go on the road without ou drummer . Jam 's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard 's , ight ? We got ta bust him out before we go anywhere .
LEX: But but , St. Bernard 's is way the hell over in the next county !
HAWK: So ? Your mom 's car has a CB , rada detector and cruise control , check ?
LEX: We are not stealing my mom 's car .
HAWK: Damn straight we are .
LEX: Hawk , all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto ! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirro after she gets back from Cincinnati .
HAWK: And when is she due back from that groinecologist 's convention anyway ?
LEX: Sunday , but
HAWK: Then lighten up . She 'll never know we touched it . Alright , here 's the plan . We bus it to chez Lex , gra the Volvo , bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard 's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2 45 to Detroit .
TRIP: Simplicity , Hawk .
LEX: Simple-icity is more like it . And you guys thought Jam was in trouble efore . Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us .
HAWK: There 's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just does n't matter anymore , Lex . You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero ?
LEX: The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity ? Yeah , I 'm vaguely familia
HAWK: Well , Jam is in absolute trouble . He could n't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse 's ass . You know as well as me he 'd give his right arm just to see Pete Criss 's drum solo , never mind a whole KISS concert , check ? Lex nods .
TRIP: Just for the record , I understood the last part of what you said , but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever .
HAWK: I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know . Just had to make it a little more complicated so he 'd understand .
LEX: Very funny , Hawk . Okay , I 'm in on this hare-brained scheme , but if anything happens to my mom 's car , I 'm blaming you . I 'll say you drugged me or something .
HAWK: Curly .
LEX: Wait a minute . We ditching the rest of school ?
TRIP: About fuckin ' time if you ask me . I 'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway .
LEX: Hello summer detention .
HAWK: As I was saying , follow my lead . And maintain . Elvis just showed up .
ELVIS: Excuse me , ladies .
NERD: Hey , I 'm responsible for that !
MISS HIBBS: Then a cry from the crow 's nest `` Thar she blows ! ''
ELVIS: KISS concert ? Kiss my ass morelike . A nice , fat detention oughta put a crimp in this evening 's plans .
HAWK: Yeah , Elvis
ELVIS: Nooooo ! !
TRIP: Well , here we are back at fucking school again .
LEX: Huh . St. Bernard 's . Figures it 's named after a canine . Hawk and Trip roll their eyes .
MRS. BRUCE: Again , many thanks and praise to you for seeing Jeremiah on such short notice .
FATHER MCNULTY: Anything for a potential tuition to be given to charity of course .
MRS. BRUCE: God bless you , Father McNulty .
FATHER MCNULTY: He already has .
LEX: Now , how are we gon na do this ?
HAWK: Gim me a second , dudes . Lem me think .
TRIP: Mmm , pizza
DELIVERY BOY: Hey , you guys know where Philip McNutly 's office is ?
HAWK: Yeah , I 'm Philip McNutly .
FATHER MCNULTY: Jeremiah , are you aware you need to answer these questions , not just listen to them ? Jeremiah ? Jam does n't respond .
NUN: Forgive me , Father . A young man here with a pizza for you ?
FATHER MCNULTY: Ah , yes ! Send him in Sister Conimaria .
HAWK: Ten even .
JAM: Check .
FATHER MCNULTY: Here 's ten and I 'm donating your tip to the church . The Lord thanks you .
HAWK: Tell the Big Guy not to mention it .
FATHER MCNULTY: And not a moment too soon . I 'm famished . I hope you brought a lunch for yourself .
JAM: No , but I 'm not hungry anyway .
FATHER MCNULTY: Well ! It finally speaks . There 's one arrier we 've broken through .
TRIP: Usually takes anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour .
HAWK: Shit ! This is such a lousy view . How the hell are we gon na know when he 's lit ?
TRIP: He 's lit .
FATHER MCNULTY: So then , the younger one says , `` But dad I 've been helping you on the farm my entire life ! You never once slaughtered the fatted calf for me ! '' And then Forgive me , Jeremiah , it 's just that I 've been telling this gospel for years and I just now realized it 's the work of some comedy mastermind ! The Prodigal Son is a arrel of fucking monkeys !
NUN: You kids ca n't go in there !
HAWK: It 's okay , we 're old buds of Fathe McNulty How 's it hangin ' , padre ?
FATHER MCNULTY: A little to the right , pizza fellow . Father McNulty laughs some more .
HAWK: That was another dude . Anyway , we 're here to take our bud Jam to the big satanic KISS concert tonight . Okay with you ?
FATHER MCNULTY: Rock on ! Jam gets up and all four boys exit .
JAM: Oh , man , my mom is gon na send me to Alcatraz for this and I do n't even care ! I 'm gon na see Peter Criss 's drum solo ! Lex taps Jam on the shoulder .
LEX: Not looking like that , Mr. Rogers .
HAWK: Next stop the 2 45 to Detroit Rock City !
LEX: My mom 's hubcap !
HAWK: Shit ! Anybody know how long it takes to fix a flat ?
LEX: Jeezis , Hawk , can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit ?
HAWK: Lex , am I gon na have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit ? Do n't worry , these babies are built for speed . Trip holds his stomach as we hear it GROWL .
TRIP: I 'm starvin ' and it 's way past lunchtime .
HAWK: Totally . All I 've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo .
TRIP: Let 's stop in Sandusky , Hawk .
HAWK: What 's in Sandusky ?
TRIP: Pizza , and I been jones-in ' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard 's .
HAWK: Only a car full of guidos and stellas would ride someone 's ass on a two- lane road and beep .
TRIP: Eyowch ! This is one hot pizza !
LEX: Trip , huck that out before it stains the upholstery !
KENNY: Stop singing NOW !
BOBBY: Hey , Kenny , look ! There 's a hunk of fawkin ' cheese on your windsheel !
LEX: Holy shit ! We just pissed off the Incredible Hulk , his idiot half other and two circus clowns .
KENNY: Stop the friggin ' car NOW !
JAM: Do n't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off ?
HAWK: What ? ! Are you mentally deranged , Jam ?
LEX: The paint !
KENNY: Do you realize the sheer , goddamn , unadulterated , undiluted , no holds arred , one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow , absolutely friggin ' STUPIDITY of what you just did ?
HAWK: Hey , disco dude , it 's cool
KENNY: DO YOU ? !
HAWK: Could be .
KENNY: And if it ai n't cleaned off ?
CHRISTINE: Kenny , come on with the macho crap already . Like this kid could take you in a fight anyway .
KENNY: Answer me , hippie girl . And if the mess ai n't cleaned off my car ?
HAWK: It could bake on ?
KENNY: You 're a smart little homo , are n't you , hippie girl ? But , while astounded at your nimble , friggin ' insight , I still detect an issue hanging fire , namely where does a sharp-witted faggot like yourself get off doing such a dopey thing like that there ?
CHRISTINE: Oh ! With the language !
KENNY: Shut-up , Christine ! Christine snarls at Kenny .
HAWK: Okay , Kenny ? I do n't mean to drain your keg or anything , but could you speed up this process ? Do n't get me wrong , we 'd love to stand here and get shit on by the cast of Saturday Night Fever , but we 're also on a schedule . So step on it .
KENNY: Are you gettin ' wise with me ?
HAWK: No , I 'm dumber than a goddamn slug . Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado ?
BOBBY: Break his fawkin ' legs , Kenny !
KENNY: Oh , you 're dumb all right , you hairy ass punk . But please , allow me to clean the friggin ' windshield . I insist .
JAM: Whoa ! This is about pizza ! Let 's leave KISS out of it . Please .
KENNY: A bunch of guys who make bad music , dress like freaks , and wear more make-up than all my sisters combined ? These assholes must be stopped ! Kenny pushes Jam away .
CHRISTINE: That 's it , Kenny ! I 'm leaving !
BARBARA: Oh , Christine ! You googatz in the head or something ? We 're on the side of the freakin ' highway !
BOBBY: Let her go , Barbara , she 'll come ack to Kenny . She always does Right , Kenny ? Kenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo .
KENNY: Kool and the Gang , now there 's real music . Kenny takes the 8-track from the car
HAWK: Well , let 's recap , shall we ? You slapped all of us , yelled at me , used my head for a rag , threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi . So , if the lesson was that you 're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut , then , yes I 'd say we learned it .
KENNY: Excuse me , I 'm a little deef-a- hearin ' . Can you repeat yourself ?
HAWK: Okay . Ahem ! You . Are . A. Dick . With . Ears . And . A . Really . Bad . Haircut .
KENNY: Oh , yeah ?
HAWK: It 's not , huh ? Well , then , tell me
KENNY: Okay , fagmo I 'll tell you what your mother said last night . She said that I was the fuck of he life .
HAWK: How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch ?
KENNY: Sure .
LEX: Not so fast , stella .
BARBARA: When they wake up , they 're gon na come looking for you jerks . You best hope they do n't find you , cause if they do , they 're gon na kick you asses .
HAWK: Right , stella , and we 'll deserve it . But let 's really make it worth thei while .
LEX: Oh , thanks for letting us draw from your ample make-up supply . You must have the entire Revlon factory in your purse !
BARBARA: Very funny . I hope you choke !
JAM: Hey , look , it 's that girl .
TRIP: That 's no girl . That 's a stella .
JAM: Stella or no stella , we should pull over and help her out .
HAWK: Oh no , Jam . I 'm not falling for that twice .
JAM: Well , could n't you slow down so I can at least state my case , Hawk ? If you do n't like it , you can speed up and I 'll never mention it again .
LEX: What is it with you , Jam ? You got a thing for that thing ?
JAM: She 's a teenage girl walking on the side of the highway . They make very scary movies that start out like that .
HAWK: Well , they may not make movies about four dudes going to a KISS concert . But if they ever did , the four dudes most certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny . Pause .
TRIP: Unless there was gon na be a scene where the disco bunny blows the fou dudes on the way to the show .
CHRISTINE: Oh , great . I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads I 'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno . Mind droppin ' me there ?
TRIP: What 's it worth to you ?
CHRISTINE: What the hell is that supposed to mean ?
JAM: It does n't mean anything . Do n't pay attention to him .
HAWK: Disco Inferno ? Disco 's infernal morelike .
LEX: Your clothes may say disco , but you eyes say rock ' n ' roll , baby .
CHRISTINE: Well , your tee-shirt may say rock ' n ' roll , but your breath says pepperoni , baby . She pushes him away . Jam laughs .
TRIP: So , are you , like , gon na polish ou nobs , or what ?
CHRISTINE: What ? That 's disgusting !
JAM: Trip ! That 's so fuckin ' rude , man .
TRIP: Oh , quit bein ' the wussy , sensitive guy to impress her , Jam . She 's obviously not gon na put out . She 's a fuckin ' tease .
CHRISTINE: Tease ? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids ?
TRIP: You got in the car , did n't you ?
CHRISTINE: Oh , God , how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere .
TRIP: Whatever stella .
CHRISTINE: The name 's Christine , not stella . And there 's no need to be such pigs just cause I prefer Donna Summer o KC and the Sunshine Boys or the Village People over KISS ?
HAWK: The Village People ? They 're fags ! You 're a fag hag !
JAM: Come on , Hawk .
CHRISTINE: I can take care of myself , but thanks anyway , germ .
JAM: Jam .
CHRISTINE: Whatever . Okay , Joe Burnout , let 's get one thing straight here . As far as I 'm concerned good tunes is good tunes , e it disco or rock or polka o whatever have you , regardless of the category . True , if I had to choose , I 'd pick the category labelled disco ecause I happen to enjoy dancing . Disco is just easier to dance to .
HAWK: You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing ? I would n't dance like that in private if you paid me .
TRIP: Disco blows dogs for quarters . Christine processes this remark .
CHRISTINE: Now there 's an intelligently biting emark wrought with wit and irony .
HAWK: Hey , if you do n't like that one , maybe you 'll think it 's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car !
CHRISTINE: Yeah , why do n't you put your money where your mouth is ?
HAWK: Why do n't you kiss my hairy crack ?
CHRISTINE: Why do n't you bend over , you 're looking right at it !
LEX: That last remark fell about 30 yards away from making any sense whatsoever .
CHRISTINE: Hey , you 're right . `` Bend over you 're looking right at it ? ! '' What 's that supposed to mean anyway ?
LEX: Man , that weed knocked Christine on her ass . She 's sleeping like a baby stella .
TRIP: Let 's lift up her shirt .
HAWK: There it is !
JAM: We made it !
LEX: Curly driving , Hawk . We still got two hours to spare .
HAWK: Ample time to grab our tickets at the station . See , up ahead . W.A.R.P . One block on the left is the W.A.R.P . tower .
JAM: Kind of funny , I thought He 'd be pissed as hell at me .
HAWK: What was that D.J . 's name again ?
TRIP: Oh , I 'll remember it till the day I die . His name was Simpleton the Simian ? No , Samson Samoan No , simply , similar
HAWK: Simple Simon ?
SIMPLE SIMON: The one and only . But can you kids hurry this up ? I 'm due at Coco Hall in half an hour for the warm-up .
HAWK: We 're right behind you , Simo . Just wanted to thank you in advance fo handing over those burly-ass tix me and my buds won this morning .
SIMPLE SIMON: Your name is n't Trip is it ?
TRIP'S VOICE: Hello ? Is this me ? I 'm Trip . Am I on the air ?
SIMPLE SIMON: Well , there you have it . We had no choice but to give the tickets to the next caller . I 'm sorry .
HAWK: Well , here we are , dudes . One hou and thirty minutes away from the concert of the century ticketless . All thanks to Wile E. Coyote , Super- Fucking Genius over here . Trip looks away from the rest , ashamed .
LEX: Really , Trip , can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change ?
TRIP: Fuck you , Lex ! This whole thing would n't have happened if it was n't for you jinxing us . I just made an honest mistake .
HAWK: Oh , I 'm sorry , Trip . What you made was a big , brainless , pile of horse shit . No offense .
JAM: Guys , GUYS ! Come on , if this is anyone 's fault , it 's mine . I was the one who grabbed Trip 's jacket by mistake . It 's my fault and I apologize .
HAWK: Please , Jam , we 're trying to vent some hostility here . Sure the whole thing may be your fault , but who 's gon na get pissed off at you ? Jam looks at his feet .
JAM: Sometimes I think I do n't deserve friends as good as you guys . Hawk , Trip , and Lex cringe .
HAWK: I have one question . How could a kid who wails on the drums like it 's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say ?
TRIP: Really , Jam , you tryin ' to make us arf ?
LEX: Yeah , it 's like you 're possessed by The Flying Nun , or something .
LEADER: Welcome to the first open meeting of MATMOK , Mothers Against The Music Of
LEX: Uh dudes ?
HAWK: Now there 's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood .
LEX: DUDES !
TRIP: It 's gone .
LEX: I can see that , bright boy . What happened to it ?
JAM: It was stolen !
HAWK: Christine stole it ! Asleep , my ass ! The stella booted with your mom 's wheels .
LEX: But we took the keys ?
TRIP: Damn , she musta hot wired it . We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John !
LEX: Okay , I 'm just a little mad now ! Jam , why 'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place ! ?
JAM: I 'm sorry , guys . I thought it was a nice thing to do .
HAWK: Jam , not another word out of you femmy-ass mouth ! Okay , we 're here , we got nothing , and we got an hou and a half . We 're totally committed . It 's time to brainstorm .
LEX: Here 's a suggestion . Let 's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation .
HAWK: Wake up , Lex . This is Detroit . The cops are n't gon na waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car . Face it , the Volvo 's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced , diced , and julienned by Christine , the chop shop gourmet .
LEX: I mean , my mom 's got insurance . What 's the worst thing she could do ? Ground me for the entire year ? I can handle that
HAWK: Cool , bro , now listen up
LEX: Holy shit ! I am in absolute trouble ! I never should have let you drive , man ! Absolute fuckin ' trouble !
HAWK: Okay , shut the fuck up , Lex ! Now , then , step number one , we find us a scalper . I got twenty-five .
TRIP: Twenty-five more ' n I got .
LEX: All I got is five . The rest is in the Volvo .
JAM: I got
HAWK: Uh-uh . Do n't tell us , Jam . Just show us . Jam holds up a ten keeping his mouth shut .
TRIP: Waitaminit , dudes ! I got it ! We find four really small kids , beat the shit outta them and steal thei tickets . What do you think ?
HAWK: Brilliance , Trip . Sheer brilliance . Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize . Trip smiles proudly .
LEX: I think we should try sneaking in .
HAWK: Four dudes sneaking in ? We 'd get usted fer sure . Bad plan .
LEX: Okay , one of us sneaks in , gets fou ticket stubs off some kids in the audience , comes back out , and we all `` re-enter '' the concerto . Voila !
HAWK: Still too risky for my money . We 're running out of time here . This is KISS ! A victory for one is a victory for the team . I 'm sure I can arter with a scalper , but if you dudes think you got better plans , go for it . We 'll reconvene at that intersection
TRIP: One more time in English .
HAWK: For the next hour and a half it 's every dude for himself . Try to get at least one ticket and at 8 30 P.M. we 'll meet over there .
JAM: Wait ! I know how we can get in !
HAWK: Jam , shut-up ! You 're not allowed to speak , remember ? Go use whateve femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four . I do n't wan na hea it .
JAM: But my plan involves all four of us acting together .
HAWK: See you at 8 30 , Jam . Later . Dudes ? Later .
LEADER: Look around you tonight , mothers ! Look at all the young faces ! They smile and laugh but their eyes have lost all hope ! Not one among them appears to possess the love and fea of God This satanic group KISS has stolen their souls .
JAM: Oh dear Lord ! !
MRS. BRUCE: I do n't know how you got here tonight and I do n't want to know either . All I know is you 're going to pay dearly for this one , young man !
JAM: Mom , what 're we ?
MRS. BRUCE: Just keep your lying , heathenous trap shut , Jeremiah .
PARISHIONERS: What a wonderful mass , Father/So inspirational , Father/Thank you .
PRIEST: Thank you/Come again next week . Mrs. Bruce pulls Jam up to the priest .
MRS. BRUCE: Can we talk , Father ? I 'm desperate . My son was about to defy God by going to that blasphemous KISS concert .
PRIEST: In that case , come right in . Meanwhile , across the street
BETH: Oh my God ! That 's Jeremiah !
DAD: Who ?
BETH: Jeremiah Bruce from school . He and his mom just went into that church . He must be in Detroit for the concert . Can I go say good-bye to him ?
MOM: Beth , I am not letting you wande the streets of Detroit after dark .
BETH: I 'm not going to wander . I 'm just gon na go over there . Beth points to St. Sebastian 's .
DAD: Fine , as long as we know where you are . But do n't be long . We need to e getting back on the road .
VOICE: Hey , chief ? Need a ticket ?
SCALPER: Second row center , seventy-five clams .
HAWK: Dude , this is all I got .
SCALPER: Sorry , man , no can do . But I 'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy .
HAWK: Where the hell am I gon na scare up that kinda gravy in one hour ?
SCALPER: The easy way .
HAWK: I ca n't just walk in and take my clothes off . It 's embarrasskin .
SCALPER: Guess you do n't want to see the greatest show on earth . And in Detroit no less . Well , take care , chief . The scalper turns and Hawk grabs his arm .
HAWK: Dude , if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it , I 'd give it my est shot . I 'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time . But this tribal , ritualistic bullshit , it 's way-too-spontaneous for me .
SCALPER: Yeah , you 're probably too young anyhow .
HAWK: Hey , I invented fake I.D.s , alright . That 's not the problem They 're playing disco music in there , man .
SCALPER: Chief , here 's a little secret . Drink heavily , your feet will know what to do . Now shit or get off the pot . Do you wan na dance or do you wan na see KISS only on their album covers ? Hawk gets a look of resolve on his face .
TRIP: No thanks , dude . I 'm beating my ticket out of some poor , defenseless chump . Trip exits FRAME .
SCALPER: What 's happening to kids today ?
HAWK: Like to sign up for the contest . The bartender gives Hawk the once over .
BARTENDER: You 're a little scrawny , but thanks to the concert we 're low on amateurs . Name ?
HAWK: Hawk .
BARTENDER: Pick a song , Hawk .
HAWK: Got any KISS ?
BARTENDER: You kidding ? This is Detroit . Drink ?
HAWK: Yeah , a man 's drink
BARTENDER: You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before ?
HAWK: Sure , I have . But not one with ice in it , that 's all .
BARTENDER: Save your money , stud muffin . The lady at the end of the bar sends he love .
HAWK: Whoa she is a killer .
BARTENDER: Amanda Finch . Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit . Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt . She like 'em young . And since you look a little new at this , let me give you three words of advice . Hard to get . Think it , act it , know it , be it . Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games .
TRIP: Hey , you little twerps , gim me you KISS tickets or I 'll pop your fuckin ' faces in .
LITTLE KID: Shit ! You just skunked my last ball , you
TRIP: Okay , booger , your KISS ticket o your life .
LITTLE KID: Please sir , do n't beat me up . I do have a KISS ticket , but not on me .
TRIP: A likely story . Hand it over , kid .
LITTLE KID: No really . My brother 's hanging onto it for safe keeping . Please , let me get him for you .
TRIP: Hey , kid , that 's okay . I do n't wan na see KISS that ba
LITTLE KID: Do n't try to run , maggot . Chongo 's an all-state track star in every event .
TRIP: What do you want ?
LITTLE KID: A tag on your toe . Nobody threatens me and lives .
TRIP: Look , you can have my wallet
LITTLE KID: It 's not nearly enough , punk .
CHONGO: This fairy givin ' you shit , bro ?
LITTLE KID: He was gon na mug me for my KISS ticket .
TRIP: Me ? Mug ? That 's nuts . I said , do you know where I can take a piss .
CHONGO: Okay , pimple dick , you 've got the option of walking outside with us o gettin ' dragged out . Either way you 're comin ' with us . Trip catches his breath .
TRIP: Please , sir , do n't kick my ass ! I 'll do anything to get out of a beating !
LITTLE KID: Say , Chongo , perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend wo n't be attending . Chongo scratches his head .
CHONGO: How much cash do you figure ?
LITTLE KID: Take five for a minute , Chongo . Let me do the math .
LEX: I ca n't believe I 'm actually entertaining the notion of sneaking in . I oughta have my cranium examined .
SECURITY GUARD: Alright , wiseguy , you are so outta here !
ROADIE: Hey , what the fuck ?
SECURITY GUARD: Where 'd he go ? You see him ?
PRIEST: Uh , next mass is n't until tomorrow morning , young lady . Run along now .
MRS. BRUCE: Now it 's been a while since my boy had holy confession . Could you ?
PRIEST: Consider it done .
MRS. BRUCE: It 's about time you gave up on that stupid dream once and for all . No son of mine is going to be a caree musician .
PRIEST: Just knock loudly , sister .
JAM: Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . This is my first confession in well a really long time .
PRIEST: Prepare to receive the Act of Penance . How many sins have you committed since your last confession ?
JAM: Just one , Father , but boy was it a doozy .
EMCEE: Okay , ladies , hang onto your hormones . Here comes our next amateur . Let 's have a big hand for Hawk !
HAWK: Oh , Dicky , I c-c-ca n't
BARTENDER: You 're not gon na chicken out on me now , are you ? We 've got your KISS song playing and everything .
HAWK: I-I c-ca n't
BARTENDER: Look , people undress in public ecause , A , they 're exhibitionists , B , they 're nutcases , or C , they need the money . I can tell you 're not A , and I hope to hell you 're not B . So my suggestion is , think about why you 're a C and let your body party , shake your groove thing , boogie oogie oogie till you just ca n't boogie no more .
HAWK: You 're right , Dicky . I got ta do it for KISS . Got ta put a bag over its head and Do it for KISS .
TRIP: Two hundred bucks ?
LITTLE KID: You heard me , nad breath . My time 's precious and I think that 's a easonable price to pay for you sorry life .
TRIP: Look , I want to live , but I do n't know where the fuck I 'm gon na find two hundred bucks . The little kid shakes his head in disgust .
LITTLE KID: Chongo ? Take him outside and tea his ass out through his mouth . Chongo advances , muscles flexing .
TRIP: Hold on ! I know how I can get the money ! I just figured it out ! Only you might wan na wait outside . The little kid and Chongo look at each other .
CHONGO: I do n't trust him .
LITTLE KID: I think he 's on the level . He 's too stupid to try anything sneaky anyway . Look at him , he 's a moron . They look back at Trip .
LEX: Keep it together , Lex . Anything worth fighting for is worth dying for .
ROADIE #2: Boy , this one 's heavy .
LEX: WHOOOOAAA !
ROADIE #2: Close that door !
JAM: So , you see if it was n't for me , me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now together .
PRIEST: That 's it ?
JAM: Yeah .
PRIEST: Well , this is a unique confession to say the least , son . And not exactly the most interesting one I 've eve heard either . You sure you do n't want to talk about oh , carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe or how about finding a box of magazines unde your dad 's bed ?
JAM: No .
PRIEST: Well then , I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets . I realize this is Detroit , but I personally find , what that rock and roll band is all about , to be boring as Lucifer 's kingdom . I 'll return in a little while .
JAM: Beth ? I ca n't believe it .
BETH: Believe it .
JAM: Are you waiting for confession ? I thought you were Jewish ?
BETH: I have a confession . Here it is .
JAM: I do n't care . I wan na hear more .
BETH: I 've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you , Jeremiah . I 've just always been too scared to show it .
JAM: Beth , I ca n't believe you just said that because that 's exactly how I 've always felt about you Call me Jam . It 's my band name .
BETH: You do n't know how long I 've been waiting to hear that Jam !
JAM: Right , slow
BETH: Oh , screw it ! She tears his tee-shirt open with her teeth .
EMCEE: Okay , ladies , it 's down to Troy the Human Jackhammer The women APPLAUD as we
HAWK: Thanks , miss .
AMANDA: You 're too kind . I 'm Amanda .
HAWK: Right , well , thanks for the drinks and stuff , Amanda , but there 's no eason for me to stick around these parts anymore .
AMANDA: Do n't be so glum , Hawk . The night 's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities .
HAWK: Huh ?
AMANDA: I 'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you 'd get in a position and spend some time on me . Hawk GULPS .
PRIEST'S VOICE: Where are you , son ?
JAM: Uhh , tying my shoe .
PRIEST'S VOICE: Oh . So , have you thought of a colorful confession yet ?
JAM: Actually , yes . Last year I walked out of a candy store with a Reggie Bar I had n't paid for , but went back and apologized the next day .
PRIEST'S VOICE: Boooring . Think , boy , think !
LEX'S VOICE: I ca n't believe you 're even thinking of committing a robbery , Trip . You do n't pass go and collect 200 dollars for pulling stuff like this .
HAWK'S VOICE: No shit , dude , is this really worth it ? Sure you get your ass kicked nine ways to Sunday by that fucking gorilla , but it 's still a hundred times better than getting it porked for the next three to five .
JAM'S VOICE: And what about that girl , Trip ? She 'll never forget this night . Even if you get away with it , she 'll be scarred for life . When are you gon na realize sometimes being tough means being tender .
TRIP: Alright , everybody , SHUT UP !
CASHIER: P-p-please , mister , I 'm just a high school kid
TRIP: Alright , drop it or I 'll kick you ass !
LEX: This is real . This is not a dream ! This is real ! I 've pierced the inne circle !
BETH: So . Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow 's tongue grafted onto his real one ? Y'know , to make it so long ?
JAM: I dunno . I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther . I 'm not too up on Gene trivia .
BETH: Your man is the drummer , Peter Criss , ight ?
JAM: Peter Criss is my inspiration , man . If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo , I 'd consider it money Hey , how 'd you know that ?
BETH: I have all your notebook doodles memorized , Jam Here .
JAM: Ann Arbor ?
BETH: My dad 's company is relocating him . We 're moving . That 's why I was acting so freaky in school today . I thought it was the last time I 'd ever see you . Anyway , open the box . I would have given it to you this morning , except like I said , I was freaking out .
PRIEST: Okay , you better have something really sinful for me this time , son . My patience is worn to threads and you mom will be here any minute .
JAM: Alright , Father , here it is . About two weeks ago I went to my cousin 's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath .
PRIEST: No
JAM: I was insulted , so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o. , right ? Then she said no , she wanted to take a bath with me .
PRIEST: Oh , this is terrible Please go on .
JAM: Well , she was a very tempting siren , Father . Built like you would n't elieve . So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding eception at this little motel that charges by the hour . Jam pauses .
PRIEST: Well ? Continue ! Continue !
JAM: Okay when she peeled off that gown , you 'll never guess what she was wearing underneath .
PRIEST: Was it a teddy ?
JAM: No . Much bet I mean , much more sinful than that .
PRIEST: A bustier ?
JAM: Tell you what . You keep guessing and I 'll say something when you get it .
PRIEST: Splendid ! I love a good game of Name That Nightie . Jam quietly sneaks out .
PRIEST'S VOICE: Satin underwear ? Crotchless panties ? Leopard skin bra ? Fishnet leotard ? Leather G-string ?
LEX: Okay , okay , you 're pissed off . I can see this . So Maybe what we need ah-ha . Lex holds up a worn-out , old frisbee .
CHRISTINE: Then maybe you guys 'll let me go , huh ?
HAWK: Thanks .
AMANDA: Gin .
HAWK: Whoa . Some of this hard liquor 's a tad too manly for me . I 'm a brewski man myself .
AMANDA: Better ease up then , Hawk . Would n't want to give you whiskey dick would we ?
HAWK: Who 's Whiskey Dick ?
AMANDA: Well . Obviously no one you have to worry about Woody .
HAWK: My name 's not Woody , it 's Haw-haw
AMANDA: But you do know Premature Peter , do n't you ? Shame , I just bought these stockings . Hawk has never been more embarrassed .
HAWK: Well , Amanda , this has been quite a night . So far you 've seen me and my dick throw up . What 's next ? Projectile diarrhea ? Man . What a stud , huh ?
AMANDA: Believe it or not , you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband the champion of lousy lovemaking . The man who thinks he 's the biggest and the best The man who thinks every secretary , stewardess , and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor . The man for whom faking it was invented . Christ , if I had n't gotten pregnant with our son , I would have never known I even had sex with the prick .
HAWK: You love him ?
AMANDA: I just told you , he 's a big , hairy
HAWK: No , I mean you love your son ?
AMANDA: More than anything in the world .
HAWK: And he loves you back , does n't he ?
AMANDA: He 's a little spoiled , but I know he does .
HAWK: Well , shame on him if he does n't . She pats his shoulder .
AMANDA: You 're sweet . Hawk stares out the windshield .
HAWK: My mom died of a heart attack while she was having me . Man , I wish I had known her for even one day . If they ever invent a time machine , that 's what I 'm doing . Going back in time to meet my mom . I 'm gon na say , `` Mrs. Pitchford ? or Miss Williams , depending on when I show up . You do n't know me , but I 'm your kid from the future . Just wanted to thank you for the blue eyes , pug nose and fo tying the knot with a guy who did n't mind diaper detail Oh , and , uh cut down on the red meat , will ya ? ''
TRIP: No , you gim me your gun , boy !
CASHIER: Thank you ! Thank you ! Who are you ?
TRIP: Call me Dr. Love !
CHRISTINE: You guys better kill me before you do what you 're thinking of doing . Cause when I 'm mad enough , I can ite down very hard . The beefy jerks laughs .
LEX: I 'm here for the girl and the car . You can try to stop me , but I must warn you , it may be hazardous to your health .
CHRISTINE: Wow ! Thank you ! You 're cooler than the Fonz .
LEX: Aaaayyyyy !
BETH: Ann Arbor is n't that far from Cleveland , right ?
JAM: Nah . Once I get my own wheels , I could come up all the time .
BETH: That 'd be great . Hey , maybe someday your band 'll play there . It 's a college town , you know ? Jam takes her hands .
JAM: I feel like such an idiot . Why did n't I just say something a year and a half ago ? Man , think of how much time we wasted .
BETH: Let 's not think about the past . Let 's just think about from today on . I 'll never forget you , Jam .
JAM: Tell me about it . Church will neve e the same again .
BETH: Coming dad . I 'll call you . Soon as we get a phone . Bye .
JAM: Bye .
HAWK: Amanda , as ironic as this is gon na sound , I ca n't take any money for I 'm no Midnight Cowboy , y'know . It would only cheapen the whole deal for me .
AMANDA: I 'm not paying you for the lovemaking , Hawk . I just want you to have whateve you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer . She forces the money into his palm .
HAWK: Thanks . They kiss .
AMANDA: You 're a good man , Hawk . Thank you .
COP #1: You would n't happen to know where we could find this Dr. Love , would you ?
CASHIER: It 's company policy to hand over a cash reward of a hundred and fifty dollars to anyone who stops a robbery . I gave him the money and he took off . The cops shrug and get into the cruiser .
COP #2: Okay , well , thanks anyway . And let us know if you happen to see him again . We 'd like to ask him some questions .
CASHIER: If I see Dr. Love any time soon , you 're gon na have to wait till I 'm done with him first .
TRIP: hundred forty , hundred fifty . That 's all I got . The little kid puts the money in his pocket .
LITTLE KID: Tsk . Tsk . Tsk . I really wanted things to work out for you , my weasly , dim- witted friend . You got spunk . Chongo , give him a fifty dolla wallop . Chongo reels back and
TRIP: Oh , no Please , look . I
CHONGO: Hey , the jerkoff 's got drugs .
LITTLE KID: Consider it a bonus , Chongo .
TRIP: At least I still got you , Stretch .
LEX: This oughta be enough to get you to Disco Inferno , Christine .
CHRISTINE: Come with . It 's not too late for you to catch the fever .
LEX: No can do . But I made a promise to get you to that disco , and we KISS maniacs are men of our word . Besides you 're pretty cool fo a stella , I mean .
CHRISTINE: Here 's my number . Tell me how cool I am over the phone sometime . Okay ? She gives Lex a kiss then pushes him away .
JAM: I 'm gon na ask you nicely first . Mom , can I have my drumsticks back ?
LEAD IDIOT: Hey , I 'm on the radio ! Hi , good- lookin ' . We 'll be back to pick you up later ! Mrs. Bruce yells at Jam through her bullhorn .
MRS. BRUCE: Drumsticks are the least of you worries , young man . You are in a world of
JAM: I know , mom , I 've been in trouble for about twelve hours now ! Hellooooo ! ?
MRS. BRUCE: Jeremiah what 's gotten into you ?
JAM: I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth ! Lord have mercy ! !
HAWK: Whoa ! Whoa ! WHOA ! That better not be the last ticket ! I hope you have another one for me !
TRIP: Plenty , but it was all bad .
LEX: I found the Volvo .
HAWK: Tickets ? They all shake no .
SURLY MOM: How dare you sneak out of the house like that ! You had me worried to death ! Do n't you know this is Detroit ! And for a degenerate band like KISS ! They 're sick , sick , sick and oughta e in jail with their vile antics !

HAWK: Nah . Could n't be .
JAM: It 's a miracle ! A miracle !
ELVIS: Whose laughing now ? ! Whose laughing now , ya little shits ? ! I told ya Over my dead body ! Ha-HA-HAAA !
HAWK: Take it easy , Elvis . Do n't do anything crazy . Just give me the tickets before someone gets hurt .
TRIP: Hey , wait a minute ! This ai n't school property ! He 's not the boss of us here !
ELVIS: That 's right . This ai n't school . It 's not about school anymore . Now it 's personal .
LEX: Come on , Elvis . We was only kiddin ' . It 's all in good fun . We run , you chase . Cat and mouse . You know .
ELVIS: Boys , this time I win !
JAM: Well I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak .
HAWK: Go ahead , Jam .
JAM: We all beat each other up , then , once we 're nice and bruised , we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen . They got ta let us in then .
HAWK: Dude , you got ta let us in ! Fou muggers just stole our tickets !
TICKET TAKER: You expect us to believe that ?
JAM: Look at us !
TRIP: It was those assholes ! They even stole my wallet !

ROY: Miranda 's new assistant . Congrats .
ANDY: Thanks . ANDY takes some candy .
ROY: You know
ANDY: You 're going to say a million girls would kill for my job .
ROY: Actually , I was going to say those Jelly Beans are seven years old . ANDY puts the candy back .
ANDY: I 'm about to walk in . I 'll call you as soon as Click . Her phone immediately rings again .
LIZ: You must be new . Congratulations . People would KILL for your job . I would . I love Miranda . She 's such an icon . I 've dealt with her a couple times , but I 'm sure she does n't emember . Just then ANDY 'S phone rings .
ANDY: There 's a um , variety of skirts . Let 's see
LIZ: Liz .
ANDY: It 's Liz .
LIZ: What did she say ?
ANDY: Is Ivan in by any chance ?
LIZ: I 'll get him .
EMILY: Oh my God . What took you so long ? I have to pee .
ANDY: You have n't peed since I left ?
EMILY: You do the coat .
ANDY: The run-through . Right .
EMILY: The editors bring in options for a shoot and Miranda chooses . She chooses every single thing in every single issue . Run-throughs are a huge deal .
ANDY: Is it always like this ?
EMILY: No . Sometimes it 's busy .
SERENA: I thought you were kidding .
EMILY: Oh , no . I was quite serious . EMILY turns to ANDY .
ANDY: You eat lunch ?
NIGEL: Corn chowder . Interesting choice . ANDY looks at him , confused .
ANDY: None of the girls here eat anything ?
NIGEL: Not since 2 became the new 4 and 0 ecame the new 2 .
ANDY: I 'm a 6 .
NIGEL: Which is the new 14 .
ANDY: Okay . You think my clothes are hideous . I get it , okay ?
NIGEL: You 're right . That 's what this multi- million dollar industry is all about . Inner beauty .
IRV: Nigel . Issue going well ?
NIGEL: Our biggest September ever .
IRV: Great . I heard Miranda killed Autumn Jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot . What 's that costing me ?
NIGEL: About 300,000 .
IRV: Must have been some lousy Jackets . But I 'm sure she knows what she 's doing .
NIGEL: Always . IRV glances over at ANDY , offers his hand .
IRV: Irv Ravitz .
NIGEL: I 'm sorry this is Andy Sachs , Miranda 's new assistant .
IRV: Congratulations , young lady . A million girls would kill for that job .
NIGEL: Chairman of Elias Clarke . You know what they say , tiny man , huge ego . We should have taken the stairs .
MIRANDA: No No No I swear I do n't understand why it 's so difficult fo you to pull together a decent run- through . You had hours to prepare Where are all the advertisers ?
LUCIA: We have some pieces from Banana Republic and
MIRANDA: We need more . MIRANDA holds up a skirt . Shows it to Nigel .
NIGEL: You know me . A full ballerina skirt with a hint of saloon and I 'm on oard .
MIRANDA: Is it too much like the
NIGEL: LaCroix from July ? I thought of that , but with the right accessories , it could work MIRANDA nods . He 's right of course .
MIRANDA: Where are the belts for this skirt ?
JOCELYN: Tough call . They 're so different .
MIRANDA: Is something funny ?
ANDY: No , no , no . It 's just
MIRANDA: This stuff ? Okay . I understand . You think this has nothing to do with you . You go to your closet and select , say , that lumpy blue sweater because you 're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what 's on your body . What you do n't know is that your sweater is not blue . It 's not even sky blue . It 's cerulean . You also do n't know that in 2002 , De La Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns , Yves St. Laurent showed a cerulean military jacket , Dolce did skirts with cerulean beads , and in ou September issue we did the definitive layout on the color . Cerulean quickly appeared in eight other majo collections , then the secondary and department store lines and then trickled down to some lovely Casual Corner , where you no doubt stumbled on it .
ANDY: You should have seen the look she gave me . I thought the flesh was going to melt off her face . NATE laughs .
NATE: Gim me that . There 's about eight dollars worth of Jarlsberg in there . He takes the sandwich , takes a bite .
ANDY: I just have to stick it out for one year . Then I can do what I came to New York to do . I ca n't let Miranda get to me . I wo n't .
NATE: Easy , Killer .
ANDY: And give me that sandwich .
NATE: Oh , no way . It 's mine now .
ANDY: Good morning , Miranda ! Thwack ! Miranda 's coat lands on Andy 's desk .
MIRANDA: Get me Isaac .
ANDY: I have Isaac . Widen out to see EMILY . A beat .
EMILY: Yes . EMILY walks away .
ANDY: Dad ! I 'll be right down !
RICHARD: Here . Do n't want you to get behind in your rent .
ANDY: How did you I 'm gon na kill Mom . Thank you .
RICHARD: Thought I 'd let you at least enjoy the bread basket first .
ANDY: Oh , just go ahead .
RICHARD: We 're just a little worried . We get emails from you at your office at 2 am , your pay is terrible , you do n't get to write anything
ANDY: Hey . Not fair . I wrote those e- mails .
RICHARD: I 'm just trying to understand why someone who was accepted to Stanford Law turns that down to be a journalist and now you 're not even doing that
ANDY: Oh please . Not this again .
RICHARD: Why did you even bother applying to law school ?
ANDY: Because it 's what you wanted . This is what I want .
RICHARD: This ? Being a secretary ?
ANDY: I 'm an executive assistant .
RICHARD: You hang coats , you go to Starbucks , you 're a secretary , Andy .
ANDY: You have to trust me . Being Miranda 's assistant opens a lot of doors . Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months , she 'll meet editors and writers from every important magazine . But RICHARD still looks dubious .
MIRANDA: My flight is cancelled Some absurd weather problem . She starts moving through the airport .
ANDY: Absolutely , Miranda . Let me see what I can do .
ANDY: I need a jet from Miami to New York A jet , any kind of jet Yes , tonight , right now . From Miami to New York . As soon as possible . Please call me ack as soon as the situation changes . I 'm trying , Miranda . No one is flying out because of the weather .
MIRANDA: Please . It 's just drizzling . Someone must be getting out . Call Donatella and get her jet . Call everyone with a jet Irv , Armani
RICHARD: Andy , come on . Let 's go in .
ANDY: I 've done everything I could think of . I do n't know what else to do .
MIRANDA: Emily . Stop making excuses . GET ME
ANDY: Oh my God . She is going to murder me .
RICHARD: Would it help if I talked to her ?
MIRANDA: The girls ' recital was wonderful . They played Rachmaninoff and everyone loved it . Except for me because I was not there .
ANDY: I 'm so sorry , Miranda .
MIRANDA: Do you know why I hired you ?
ANDY: I did everything I could think of
MIRANDA: That 's all .
EMILY: Excuse me , where do you think you ANDY keeps running .
ANDY: She hates me , Nigel .
NIGEL: And that 's my problem because wait , no . Not my problem .
ANDY: I need your help . I do n't know what to do . It 's like I 'm completely beneath her contempt .
NIGEL: So quit .
ANDY: That 's not fair . I 'm lucky to be working for Miranda I did n't get that at first , but I do now . I want to e here . But it just seems like no matter how hard I try , I do n't do anything right .
NIGEL: Andy , please . Be serious . You 're not trying . You 're whining . She looks shocked .
ANDY: Okay , fine ! He looks at her .
NIGEL: Oh , no . No way
ANDY: You do it with the other girls .
NIGEL: The other girls are different . They eally want it .
ANDY: Please , Nigel . Do n't make me beg He looks at her , thinking
NIGEL: I do n't know what you expect me to do . These are all sample sizes 2 and 4 . He thinks , hands her an item .
ANDY: A poncho ?
NIGEL: You 'll take what I give you and you 'll like it .
EMILY: I have no idea why Miranda hired her .
SERENA: Me , neither . The other day we were in the Beauty Department and she held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said `` What is this ? '' They laugh at the total absurdity of this .
EMILY: I knew from the moment I saw her that she was a complete and utter
ANDY: Miranda Priestly 's office . She 's not in . I 'll leave word . She hangs up . EMILY is still gaping .
ANDY: What do you think ?
NATE: I think we better get out of here efore my girlfriend sees me with you .
ANDY: Wan na lift , stranger ?
MIRANDA: The gowns are fabulous , Ralph . We 're using the burgundy for the cover try and the lemon chiffon for the goddess story .
ANDY: Bang & Olufsen . Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday .
NATE: All for a woman who does n't need anything . Perfect .
ANDY: Here A bunch of Kiehl 's , some Mason Pearson hair brushes
DOUG: Dammit , I love your job .
ANDY: It 's called `` Pink '' . For women .
DOUG: Men can be pink . I have a pink side .
LILY: Please . We 're eating . ANDY hands LILY a blue purse . LILY gasps .
ANDY: Sure you can .
NATE: Why do women need so many bags ? You get one , it holds all your junk , are n't you done ?
DOUG: Fashion is not about utility , Nate . An accessory is merely a piece of iconography used to express individual identity .
LILY: And it 's preeeetty .
DOUG: That too .
ANDY: Thing is , it turns out there 's a lot more to Runway than fancy purses you know who 's coming into the office Friday ? John Updike .
NATE: Why , does he need a sweater ?
ANDY: Look , there 's a piece by Jay McInerney , an essay by Joan Didion , an interview with Christiane Amanpou oh
NATE: Look who 's drinking the KoolAid .
ANDY: Give me the phone . He checks the name on the phone .
NATE: Oh , look . The Dragon Lady . Of course .
ANDY: Give me the phone .
LILY: I 'll talk to her . Tell her she needs to get her own scrambled eggs .
ANDY: Come on , guys . Give me the phone !
JAMES: You must be the new Emily . Let me see . He checks her out . Looks at her handbag .
ANDY: You .
JAMES: Duh . He hands her a folio with a handle .
ANDY: I 'll guard it with my life .
JAMES: Come on . You work for Miranda , you must be in desperate need of hard liquor .
CHRISTIAN: He 's right . I had the punch at James 's last party , woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing but boxers and a cowboy hat .
ANDY: Hi . I , um I have to go .
CHRISTIAN: But you want to stay . You 've neve een to a party like this .
ANDY: God , I love it when total strangers tell me how I feel .
CHRISTIAN: That 's my way . Christian Thompson .
ANDY: Christian Thompson ? You 're kidding . You write for every magazine I love . I actually reviewed your collection of essays for my college paper .
CHRISTIAN: Did you mention my good looks and killer charm ?
ANDY: No , but I did point out some factual errors and a penchant fo confessional semi-fiction that borders on self-indulgent .
CHRISTIAN: You and the Times . And what do you do ?
ANDY: Well , I want to work somewhere like the New Yorker or Vanity Fair . I 'm also a writer , but
CHRISTIAN: Is that right ? I should read you stuff . Send it over .
ANDY: Thank you . That would be great . Anyway , for now I 'm Miranda Priestly 's assistant . And his expression immediately changes .
CHRISTIAN: You 're kidding . Oh , that 's too bad . You 'll never survive Miranda .
ANDY: Excuse me ?
CHRISTIAN: You 're smart , you 're nice , you have a point of view . You ca n't do that job . ANDY hands him her glass of punch .
ANDY: I have to go . She starts to leave .
CHRISTIAN: Let me guess . You have a boyfriend waiting . From not high school college ? Nice-looking guy , devoted , about to ask you to move in with him , ut you 're not sure
ANDY: You . Are not a nice person .
CHRISTIAN: Nice to meet you , Miranda girl .
ANDY: For your information , he 's really handsome . And we already live together !
NATE: You got the nuclear briefcase from the undisclosed location . I 'm proud of you .
ANDY: Where are you going ?
NATE: Doug and some of his banker buddies are playing Texas Hold ` Em at his apartment . Gon na go get me some of that Wall Street cash .
ANDY: But I came back so we could hang out .
NATE: Man , I 'm sorry . You did n't make that crystal clear when you stormed off after calling me an asshole .
ANDY: Okay , look , I 'm sorry about that He gives her a kiss .
NATE: I 'll see you later , okay ?
MIRANDA: Sure , Doug ! I 'll get on it ASAP ! A six- pack ? No problem . Budweiser o Michelob ? Chilled ? Of course
NIGEL: They 're not expecting us until Tuesday . Did she say why ?
ANDY: Yes , she explained every detail of he decision-making , then we brushed each other 's hair and gabbed about American Idol .
NIGEL: I see your point .
MIRANDA: Just let us out here .
NIGEL: And then there 's the pursing of the lips .
ANDY: What does that mean ?
NIGEL: Catastrophe .
ANDY: Last time I was here , James was having this cool party and and this is why you do n't like people riding up in the elevator with you .
JAMES: Miranda . Great to see you .
MIRANDA: Yes . I did .
JAMES: This season I started to think about the intersection of East and West
ANDY: She pursed her lips and because of that he 's going to change his entire collection ?
NIGEL: You still do n't get it , do you ? He opinion is the only one that matters .
MIRANDA: Make sure you confirm my dinner with
ANDY: Galliano at Pastis . Done .
MIRANDA: And I need to see the look book fo the November denim shoot .
ANDY: It 's in the car .
MIRANDA: Fine . MIRANDA turns to leave , pauses .
EMILY: Guard this with your life .
ANDY: Of course . If I can deliver the Book , that means I must have done something ight , that she does n't think I 'm psycho . Oh , and she actually called me Andrea instead of Emily . Is n't that great ?
EMILY: Yeah . Whoopee . Okay , now , it 's very important that you do EXACTLY what I 'm about to tell you .
ANDY: Shit .
CASSIDY: It 's that door . On the left .
CAROLINE: You can give us the Book .
CASSIDY: We 'll give it to her . ANDY shakes her head . No no no .
CAROLINE: It 's okay . Come on up .
ANDY: But I ca n't Shh
CASSIDY: It 's okay .
MIRANDA: What did you want me to do ? Walk out in the middle of a photo shoot ? ANDY freezes .
STEPHEN: I rushed out of an investment committee meeting early , then I sat there waiting for you for almost an hour
MIRANDA: We were in a loft near the Seaport . My phone did n't work . I told you .
STEPHEN: and I knew what everyone in the estaurant was thinking . There he is , waiting for HER again
ANDY: Okay , before you start freaking out , it was n't such a big deal . The twins said hello , I said hello back , then I went upstairs and gave the book to Miranda
EMILY: You went upstairs ? Oh my God . Why did n't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story ?
ANDY: You 're right . I made a mistake .
EMILY: Do n't you understand ? If you get fired , that might jeopardize Paris fo me . And if that happens , I will search every Blimpie 's in the tri-state area until I find you and kill you .
ANDY: Wait a second . She 's going to fire me ?
EMILY: I do n't know . She 's not happy .
MIRANDA: An-dre-a . ANDY and EMILY exchange a look . Oh , boy .
ANDY: Miranda , about last night , I
MIRANDA: I need the new Harry Potter book fo the twins .
ANDY: Of course . I 'll run down to Barnes & Noble right now .
MIRANDA: Did you fall down and smack you little head on the pavement ?
ANDY: Not that I can recall .
MIRANDA: We have all the published Harry Potte ooks . The girls want to know what happens next .
ANDY: So you want the unpublished manuscript . MIRANDA gives her a look . Is there a problem ?
MIRANDA: We know everyone in publishing . Should n't be a problem . You can do anything , right ?
ANDY: She does n't get it . There 's no way I can get that book . I do n't care who I call .
MIRANDA: My girls are leaving on the train to their Grandmother 's at 3 . They 'll need the book by then .
ANDY: Of course .
MIRANDA: I 'd like my steak in fifteen minutes .
ANDY: No problem . MIRANDA exits .
EMILY: Oh look , you 're getting paranoid . Yay . It 's not just me . Listen , do n't freak out . There could be a silver lining here . ANDY looks at her . Really ?
ANDY: Or
EMILY: Or , you know , that thing you were saying about the cat .
ANDY: It 's for Miranda Priestly it 's very important . Yes , I know , it 's impossible to get
MARTY: What an amazing job , working fo someone like Ms. Priestly .
ANDY: Yeah . It 's a real party .
CHRISTIAN: Of course I remember you , Miranda Girl . You shaken off the college oyfriend yet ?
ANDY: Listen . I desperately need a favor . And I do n't know many people in the ook world On CHRISTIAN , getting out of a taxi .
CHRISTIAN: The Harry Potter manuscript ? You 've got ta be kidding .
ANDY: We 're talking about Miranda Priestly . There is no plan B , only plan A .
EMILY: You know , I rarely say this to people who are n't me , but you need to calm down .
MIRANDA: What is that doing here ? I ordered it ages ago . ANDY looks confused . Ages ?
ANDY: Harry Potter . The manuscript . It 's for Miranda Priestly . I need it today . Can you make it extra hot ? Like , center of the sun hot ? The BARRISTA gives her a look .
BARRISTA: Sounds like a great job .
ANDY: Actually , it is . A million girls would kill for it .
NATE: Quit ? Are you sure ?
ANDY: I failed . She 's going to fire me anyway . Might as well beat her to the punch .
NATE: Wow . Good for you . Congratulations , Andy . You 're free .
ANDY: Call you later .
CHRISTIAN: Oh yes . A friend of a friend does the cover art . She has the manuscript .
ANDY: No . That would mean I actually did something right . But see thing is See , I was about to
CHRISTIAN: You want this , you better hurry . Meet me at the St. Regis .
ANDY: Yes , I 'm meeting someone The butler opens the door for Andy .
CHRISTIAN: You have one hour .
ANDY: I 'm begging you . You have to stall her . Just ten minutes .
HENRY: Too much traffic on 5th . UN 's in session . MIRANDA makes an annoyed face .
MIRANDA: One copy ? What are my twins supposed to do with that share ?
ANDY: Actually I made two copies . And had them color-copied , re-set and bound so they would n't look like manuscripts .
MIRANDA: And where exactly are those fabulous copies ? I do n't see them anywhere .
ANDY: Anything else I can do for you ?
NATE: I went over to Dean & DeLuca man , they charge like five bucks a strawberry , but I figured , you quit , we should celebrate .
ANDY: Listen , Nate And he sees what she 's doing . Realizes .
NATE: So you quit , but you 're still doing the twins ' science project . Big of you .
ANDY: After I called you , I realized It does n't make sense to throw away all these months of hard work . I just had a moment of weakness . That 's all .
NATE: Either that or your job sucks and you oss is a wacko . She looks at him .
ANDY: That 's all it is , Nate . Just a job .
NATE: No , no . It 's an important magazine . That 's what you said , right ?
ANDY: I get the point , Nate . He continues leafing through .
NATE: The new Botox . The new pea coat . The new Gstaad . What the hell is
ANDY: Gstaad . It 's a ski resort . In Switzerland .
NATE: See ? I now live with someone who knows that . Thank you , Miranda Priestly .
ANDY: Nate , it 's not like I run the magazine . I just work there , remember ?
NATE: That 's the thing I liked your old clothes .
ANDY: What about these ? These are pretty nice . He does n't take the bait .
NATE: I like that . He grabs her and kisses her .
NIGEL: Posen 's doing some very sculptural suits , so Testino wants to shoot them at the Noguchi Garden in the Chase uilding .
MIRANDA: Perfect . What about the accessories pages for April ?
JOCELYN: One thought was enamel bangles , pendants , earrings
MIRANDA: We did that two years ago . What else ?
JOCELYN: Well , they 're showing a lot of florals for spring and so
MIRANDA: Florals . For spring . Groundbreaking .
PAUL: But we thought about shooting them in an industrial space . She looks at him . Death ray . He soldiers on .
MIRANDA: No .
PAUL: which
MIRANDA: No .
ANDY: Are you okay ?
EMILY: Tonight 's the benefit . I 've been looking forward to it for MONTHS . I efuse to be sick . I 'm wearing Valentino . Everyone 's going to be leaving to get dressed soon , so after you drop off Miranda 's Fendi bag at the re-beaders , you can just go home .
ANDY: Great . Thanks . That 's perfect , because I need to get to Magnolia Bakery efore they close
MIRANDA: I want to make sure before the benefit that you are both fully prepped on the guest list . ANDY and EMILY exchange a look .

MIRANDA: Only when the first assistant has n't decided to be disgustingly ill. You 'll come and help Emily . On EMILY and ANDY 'S surprised faces .
EMILY: I do n't see why she needs both of us . Eight second coughing fit .

ANDY: It 's definitely working .
EMILY: I know . I 'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight .
ANDY: That 's great .
EMILY: Ready ?
EMILY: We need to make sure we 're there the second she walks in .

ANDY: Thank you . Thank you so much .
MIRANDA: Darling , there you are .
STEPHEN: It 's a banner evening . Three people have failed to recognize me , one person called me Mr. Priestly , and now the damned bartender refuses to serve me .
ANDY: I 'm sorry to bother you , but I 've been dying to ask you Is it true that John Cheever used to ghostwrite the editor 's page of Manhattan Magazine in the 50 's ?
MIRANDA: Come on , darling , let 's get something to eat . I 'm starved , are n't you ?
CHRISTIAN: Look at you you 're a vision . Thank God I saved your job .
ANDY: Hey , I figured out a few things on my own , too . Turns out I 'm not as nice as you thought .
CHRISTIAN: God I hope not .
ANDY: Do you really say things like that to people ?
CHRISTIAN: Evidently .
ANDY: I have to go
CHRISTIAN: Are you sure ? My editor from Vanity Fair is in there and I was going to introduce you to him . You sent me your stuff , remember ? I have to be honest , I only read a couple that was quite a big packet - - but they were n't half-bad . You 're pretty talented , Andy . He should meet you . Come on in . Just one drink .

NATE: Do n't worry about it . I 'm going to ed . He walks past her .
ANDY: Can we at least talk about it this He starts to leave , turns , looks at her .
NATE: You look really pretty .
ANDY: I do n't understand what 's so difficult about scheduling a preview . If you want Miranda to give you any editorial , we 'll need to see the clothing at least three weeks before the show . Yes , please . See what you can do .
EMILY: Everything okay ?
ANDY: Yeah . I 'm fine . The phone rings .
JOCELYN: No , no , no . I think Gisele should be the lizard and Vivian the donkey .
NIGEL: The lizard 's better with the Dolce . Sometimes I ca n't believe I talk about this crap all day .
CLACKER #2: God , we should have a pig mask fo Rhona .
CLACKER #1: I know . She 's huge .
NIGEL: Get these to Miranda right away . Tell her I switched in the Dior for the Rochas .
ANDY: Great . No problem .
NIGEL: Hey . Adjust the attitude . Do n't make me feed you to one of the models .
ANDY: Sorry . Busy day . And my personal life is going down the drain . That 's all .
NIGEL: Join the club . You start to do well at work , that 's what happens . ANDY looks at him . I 'm doing well at work ?
MIRANDA: Andrea . Come up here .
MIRANDA: Paris is the most important week of my year . I need the best team possible with me .
ANDY: Wait . You want ME to oh , no . No , no . Emily would die . Her whole life is about Paris . MIRANDA stares . Does n't care .
MIRANDA: If you do n't go , I 'll assume you 're not serious about your future at Runway or any other publication . ANDY looks at her .
ANDY: But
MIRANDA: That 's all .
EMILY: Sorry I 'm late . Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermes and she told me yesterday but I forgot and so
ANDY: Okay . Emily . When you get in , I want to talk to you about something
EMILY: I hope it 's not another Miranda problem
ANDY: Not exactly .
EMILY: Good . Because I 've got so much to deal with before I go , I swear to God I ca n't even
EMILY: I do n't care if she was going to fire you or beat you with a red hot poker , you should have said no .
ANDY: I did n't have a choice . You know how she is .
EMILY: Oh , please . That 's a pathetic excuse .
ANDY: Look , I know you 're mad . And I do n't lame you .
EMILY: Face it , Andy . You sold your soul the day you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos . She bites off a hunk of dinner roll
ANDY: Emily
EMILY: I said , go !
DOUG: You 're going to Paris for the couture shows ? That 's the coolest fashion event of the year who are you going to see Galliano ? Lagerfeld ? Nicolas Ghesquiere ?
ANDY: Okay , now you 're scaring me . Just then LILY walks over to them .
LILY: I was n't sure you would be able to make it .
ANDY: What are you talking about ? I would n't miss this . LILY and DOUG look at her . ANDY Okay , so lately I 've missed a few things a lot of things almost everything .
LILY: I 'm just glad you 're here . Start with the murals in the other room . They 're amazing
CHRISTIAN: Hey , Miranda Girl .
ANDY: Come on .
CHRISTIAN: It 's true . I 'm profiling Gaultier fo Interview and I was making plans fo Paris and found myself wondering if you would be there .
ANDY: Actually Stop smiling . Why am I smiling ? ANDY I am going
CHRISTIAN: That 's great . I 'm staying at a fantastic little hotel in the Seventh across the street from a falafel estaurant that will change your life .
ANDY: Sorry . I 'll be too busy working . You 'll have to find someone else 's life to change .
CHRISTIAN: But that 's just it . I 'm starting to wonder if I can .
ANDY: He 's just a guy I know from work .
LILY: Yeah . That looked like work .
ANDY: You 're making a big a deal out of
LILY: The Andy I know is madly in love with Nate , is always five minutes early and thinks Club Monaco is couture . For the last 16 years I 've known everything about that Andy , but this person ? She gestures to ANDY . LILY This glamazon who skulks around in corners with some random hot fashion guy ? I do n't get her . ANDY looks at her , stunned .
NATE: You 're going to Paris ?
ANDY: It just happened
NATE: I thought Paris was some big deal fo Emily and
ANDY: Great . Now you 're going to give me a hard time , too ? And ANDY walks away , upset . NATE follows her .
NATE: What the hell is wrong with you ?
ANDY: Miranda asked me and I could n't say no , okay ? I did n't have a choice .
NATE: I know , I know . That 's your answer fo everything lately . I did n't have a choice . Like this job was forced on you . Like you do n't make these decisions yourself
ANDY: Okay . I get it , you 're mad because I work late all the time , because I missed your birthday party
NATE: Oh , come on . What am I , four ?
ANDY: You hate Runway . And Miranda . You think fashion is stupid . You 've made that clear .
NATE: Andy , I make port wine reductions all day . I 'm not exactly in the Peace Corps . I would n't care if you were out all night pole dancing if you did it with some integrity .
ANDY: So now I have no integrity . Great .
NATE: You used to say this was just a job . You made fun of the Runway girls . And now you 've become one of them .
ANDY: That 's absurd .
NATE: Look at you . Now that I know how much you 're willing to change to be successful , it makes me wonder if we ever had anything in common .
ANDY: You do n't mean that .
NATE: I do . I really do . Beat . ANDY tries to catch her breath .
ANDY: Then maybe this trip is coming at a good time . Maybe we should take a eak .
NATE: In case you 're wondering , the person whose calls you always take , that 's the relationship you 're in . The phone keeps ringing .
ANDY: Hello , Miranda
BELLMAN: That 's correct , Mademoiselle . Miranda Priestly 's suite is down the hall .
ANDY: This is my room ?
CHRISTIAN: You know , I 've been thinking , and you still owe me for Harry Potter .
ANDY: Oh , do I ?
CHRISTIAN: Of course you do . You working tonight ?
ANDY: Actually , Miranda has a dinner .
CHRISTIAN: So you 're free . Perfect . Oh , but there 's a problem , huh ? Le Boyfriend .
ANDY: Oh , you 're so full of it . You are not desolé at all .
CHRISTIAN: Yeah , not even a little . What time should I pick you up ?
MIRANDA: There you are . We need to go over the seating chart for the luncheon .
ANDY: Sure . No problem . I have it right here , um And finally MIRANDA focuses on her .
MIRANDA: By all means , move at a glacial pace . You know how that thrills me .
ANDY: But your table is full .
MIRANDA: Stephen wo n't be coming .
ANDY: So Stephen is not so you do n't need me to fetch Stephen from the airport tomorrow ?
MIRANDA: Well , if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce , then `` fetch '' him . Fetch away . ANDY now freezes .
ANDY: Of course .
MIRANDA: Another divorce in the papers and we all know what they 'll say about me - - Dragon Lady , career-obsessed , drove away another `` Mr. Priestly '' .
ANDY: Miranda , I 'm so sorry . If you want me to cancel your evening , I can .
MIRANDA: Do n't be ridiculous why would you do that ?
ANDY: Miranda , is there is there anything else I can do ?
MIRANDA: Your job .
NIGEL: Hi . Listen , I need Miranda 's itinerary ecause He looks at her outfit .
ANDY: What do you mean ?
NIGEL: That outfit .
ANDY: Oh , I just threw it on .
NIGEL: Incredible . Well , I guess my work here eally is done . Come on . Let 's have champagne . We 're celebrating .
ANDY: What are we toasting ?
NIGEL: To getting the dream job , the one a million girls wanted .
ANDY: Nigel . I got my job months ago .
NIGEL: I 'm not talking about you . She looks at him , confused .
ANDY: You 're leaving ? Nigel , I ca n't imagine Runway without you .
NIGEL: Can you believe it ? For the first time in eighteen years , I 'm going to call the shots in my own life . One day I might be able to come to Paris and actually see Paris .
ANDY: God . I 'm so happy for you , Nigel . You deserve it .
NIGEL: Bet your ass . He raises a glass . They toast .
ANDY: I 've never seen anyone as dedicated as Miranda .
CHRISTIAN: That 's fantastic . Can we stop talking about her now ?
ANDY: I 'm just saying , yes , there are things she does I do n't agree with , but
CHRISTIAN: Oh , come on , Andy . You hate her . Just admit it . She 's a notorious sadist , and not in the good way .
ANDY: Okay , so she 's tough , but if Miranda were a man , no one would notice anything but how great she is at he job . CHRISTIAN bursts into laughter .
CHRISTIAN: I ca n't believe this . You 're defending her . The wide-eyed girl peddling he earnest newspaper stories you 're crossing over to the dark side .
ANDY: I resent that .
CHRISTIAN: You should n't . It 's sexy .
ANDY: Sexy ? Really ?
CHRISTIAN: Really .
ANDY: I have no idea where we 're going . You could be leading me anywhere
CHRISTIAN: Do n't worry . I know this city like the ack of my hand . It 's my favorite place on the planet . You know what Gertrude Stein said `` America is my country and Paris is my hometown . '' She looks at him and laughs .
ANDY: You are unbelievable . Do you write that stuff down and file it away to use on girls ?
CHRISTIAN: I work free-lance . Leaves me with some time on my hands .
ANDY: Well , I never understood why everyone was so crazy about Paris , but now She swirls around .
CHRISTIAN: Thank God .
ANDY: What the hell is this ?
CHRISTIAN: What does it look like ? It 's a mock- up .
ANDY: Of ?
CHRISTIAN: Of what American Runway will look like when Jacqueline is the new editor-in- chief . He walks into the hotel room .
ANDY: They 're replacing Miranda ?
CHRISTIAN: Yes . And she 's bringing me in to run all the editorial content . Are you really surprised ? Jacqueline is a lot younger than Miranda . Has a fresher take on things . Not to mention that American Runway is one of the most expensive books in the business . Jacqueline does the same thing with a lot less money . Irv is a businessman , you know .
ANDY: Miranda will be devastated . Runway is her whole life . He ca n't do that to her .
CHRISTIAN: It 's done . Irv 's going to tell Miranda after the party for James .
ANDY: And she has no idea ?
CHRISTIAN: She 's a big girl . She 'll be fine .
ANDY: I have to go . She walks away . He calls after her .
CHRISTIAN: It 's done , Andy .
ANDY: Oh , thank God . Where are you ?
MIRANDA: Excuse me ?
ANDY: I need to talk to you . Right away . It 's about Jacqueline Follet , she Click .
MIRANDA: Excuse us a moment . MIRANDA pulls ANDY into the hall .
ANDY: I have to talk to you .
MIRANDA: Do not disturb me again .
ANDY: Miranda , wait . I have to talk to you . You can fire me if you want to afte that , but Irv is going to make Jacqueline Follet editor-in-chief of Runway . Christian Thompson told me , he 's going to work for her . Irv 's going to tell you today . I thought if I told you now , you could fix it .
MIRANDA: Are those freesias ?
ANDY: What ? No . I specifically told them
MIRANDA: If I see freesia anywhere , I will be very disappointed . She walks away . Leaving ANDY standing there .
NIGEL: For seventy-two years , Runway has been more than a magazine , it 's been a eacon of elegance and grace . Miranda Priestly is the finest possible guardian of that beacon , setting a standard that inspires people across the globe . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you Miranda Priestly .
MIRANDA: Thank you everyone . Before I talk to you about James and everything he 's accomplished , I have news .
ANDY: You said it was your dream job .
NIGEL: I 've given her everything I have , Andy . She knows that .
ANDY: But you do n't need her . You could just leave anyway and-
NIGEL: When the time is right , she 'll pay me ack .
ANDY: You sure about that ?
NIGEL: No . But I hope for the best . I have to . And he rejoins the swirl .
MIRANDA: I 'm ready to go .
CONTINUED: 102aA .
MIRANDA: Any of his other choices would find the job impossible and the magazine would surely suffer . Especially ecause of the list
MIRANDA: all of whom have promised to follow me whenever and if ever I leave Runway . To any publication I choose . Of course , as soon as Irv understood , he reconsidered .
MIRANDA: I must say , I was impressed with you , how intently you tried to warn me . ANDY looks at her , stunned that she knows .
ANDY: But I do n't think I am like that . MIRANDA looks at her . Oh ?
MIRANDA: Of course you can . You already did . To Emily . ANDY reels .
ANDY: That 's not what I that was different . I did n't have a choice .
MIRANDA: No . You did choose . You chose to get ahead . You want this life , those choices are necessary .
ANDY: But what if it 's not what I want ? I mean , what if I do n't want to live the way you do ?
MIRANDA: Do n't be silly , Andrea . This is what everyone wants . Everyone wants to be us .
LILY: Sorry . Town car 's in the shop .
ANDY: You 're such a pain .
LILY: And you 'd be lost without me .
ANDY: True . They hug . And start walking away together
LILY: Does this mean I have to give my purse ack ? She hugs it close .
NATE: I have to be at work in ten minutes . What 's up ?
ANDY: I just wanted to say She gathers her nerve .
NATE: Shoes . And jackets and belts and
ANDY: Nate , I 'm just I 'm so sorry . Beat . He looks at her .
NATE: I flew up to Boston while you were gone . Interviewed at the Oak Room .
ANDY: And ?
NATE: You 're looking at their new sous-chef . I 'm moving up there in a few weeks .
ANDY: That 's great , I congratulations . A moment . As it sinks in what this means .
NATE: They have bread in Boston . Might even have Jarlsberg . We might be able to figure something out .
ANDY: You think ?
NATE: You never know .
ANDY: Not sure .
NATE: I 'm not worried about you . Anything you try , you 're gon na kick ass .
ANDY: You think so ?
NATE: No . I know it .
ANDY: Thanks . I actually have a jo interview today . Beat . He looks her up and down .
NATE: And that 's what you 're wearing ?
EDITOR: You know our pay is crap .
ANDY: That 's fine .
EDITOR: Your clips were excellent . That thing on the janitor 's union that 's exactly what we do here . She smiles , humble now .
ANDY: Learned a lot . In the end , though , I kind of screwed it up .
EDITOR: That 's not what I hear . ANDY looks at him , confused .
EMILY: My God , you call this a letter ? Can you spell any word in the English language ? The phone rings . EMILY picks up .
ANDY: Emily , it 's Andy . Do n't hang up . I have a favor to ask you .
EMILY: You 're joking . YOU have a favor to ask of ME ?
ANDY: Thing is , I have all these clothes from Paris and I do n't have anyplace to wear them , so I was wondering is there any way you could take them off my hands ?
EMILY: Well , I do n't know . It is a huge imposition , but I suppose I could help you out I 'll have Roy pick them up this afternoon .
ANDY: Thanks , Emily . I appreciate it .
EMILY: Why ca n't you be more like Andy ?
MIRANDA: I do n't understand why it 's so challenging to get a car when I ask for one .

KEVIN: Math has n't exactly been you subject this year , has it ?
BARBARA: No .
KEVIN: Any theories on why you 've done so poorly in math this year ?
BARBARA: It 's not my fault .
KEVIN: Would you say Mr. Gettys is the problem ? You 're not sure . Have you had any discipline problems in math class this year ?
BARBARA: No .
KEVIN: No ? Is n't it true Mr. Gettys has had to talk to you repeatedly about your behavior ? Is n't that why he asked you to stay afte class ?

KEVIN: Credibility and bias .
JUDGE: Overruled . Answer the question .
BARBARA: Yes .

KEVIN: I put a couple hundred in here
MRS. LOMAX: Sounds like more than two weeks .
KEVIN: Mary Ann typed out the numbers fo you phone , the flights it 's all in there .
MRS. LOMAX: Let me tell you about New York .
KEVIN: Babylon .
MRS. LOMAX: Forewarned is forearmed . 'Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great . It has become a dwelling place of demons . ' Revelation Eighteen . Would n't hurt you to look it over .

MRS. LOMAX: And what happened to Babylon ?
KEVIN: 'Thou mighty city . In one hou hast thou mighty judgement come . '
MRS. LOMAX: 'And the light of a single lamp shall shine in thee no more . '
KEVIN: Okay . Open your eyes .
MARY ANN: Wow .

KEVIN: I do n't know looks to me like that dress is in your way .
MARY ANN: Why , counselor Surely you do n't think a small- town girl changes overnight just ecause a man buys her dinner in the big city .
KEVIN: No , ma'am . In fact , I hardly eve think at all .
MARY ANN: Well , that 's different , then . You 're my kind of guy .
MEISEL: Do you think as a juror you 'd be able to set aside any prio opinions you might hold about the savings and loan industry ? That was a question , sir .
KEVIN: Dump him . While you 're at it let 's get rid of number six , eight , and I 'd say lose numbe twelve , except the prosecutor 's gon na fuck up and do it for us .
MEISEL: Number six ? You 're kidding , ight ? She 's my first choice .
KEVIN: She 's my first pass .
MEISEL: And eight ? With the dreadlocks ? That 's crazy . He 's a defendant juror if I ever saw one .
KEVIN: You see his shoes ?
MEISEL: Look , kid , maybe down in Florida you 're the next big thing , but this is New York . Manhattan . We 're not squeezing oranges here .
KEVIN: He polishes those shoes every night . He makes his own clothes . He may look like a brother-with- an-attitude to you , but I see a man who 's got a shotgun under his ed and woe betide the creature who steps into his garden . And number six ? Your favorite ? She 's damaged goods .
MEISEL: She 's a Catholic schoolteacher . She believes in human frailty .
KEVIN: No . There 's something missing from her . She 's wrong . She wants on this jury . Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge .
MEISEL: How the hell do you know that ?
KEVIN: I do n't know .
MEISEL: Look , either you put a stop to this happy horseshit or I walk .
HEATH: Walk .

MARY ANN: Omigod
KEVIN: Thirty-eight minutes . My jury .
MARY ANN: You did it ! Omigod , Kevin
KEVIN: Put on something that 's gon na be easy to take off later . We are going out , girl !
HEATH: Sorry to keep you waiting , but Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia a little longer than expected . Not bad , huh ? You can play it cool if you want , but the first time I walked in here , my jaw was on the floor .
HEATH: We 've got forty partners vested at the moment . Close to six hundred associates . This is the home office , but we 've got quite a few international arrangements , so Mr. Milton spends a good deal of his time in the air . In addition to our corporate clients , we 're currently representing about twenty-five foreign countries . Mid-East , Balkans , Central America , West Africa . Interesting work , but travel intensive . Kevin slowing as they pass an open doorway
HEATH: I watched a Senator piss his pants ight where you 're standing .
KEVIN: Great .
HEATH: He 's waiting for you . Good luck .
MILTON: Sorry . Did n't mean to
KEVIN: No . Please . Kevin Lomax .
MILTON: John Milton .
KEVIN: Nice to meet you .
MILTON: Have we been treating you well ?
KEVIN: Very well . Thank you .
MILTON: Your wife , she 's had a good time ?
KEVIN: She sure has . It 's been great . The whole thing 's been great .
MILTON: Good . That 's our secret . We kill you with kindness . What 's your secret ?
KEVIN: I could n't say .
MILTON: You were a prosecutor .
KEVIN: Out of law school . Five years in the Jacksonville D.A . 's office .
MILTON: Sixty-four straight convictions . What a number .
KEVIN: I like to be in court . I did n't plea out a lot .
MILTON: What 's that like ? One day you 're putting them away and the next you 're setting them free ?
KEVIN: Takes a little getting used to .
MILTON: Pays better though , does n't it ?
KEVIN: Yes it does .
MILTON: The math teacher . The Gettys case . I hear you were brilliant .
KEVIN: Prosecutor dropped the ball .
MILTON: Really . So you think your guy was guilty .
KEVIN: I did n't say that .
MILTON: What did you say ?
KEVIN: How 's this ? I began the case with a clear conscience .
MILTON: I was sure you had a secret .
KEVIN: The men 's room . Upstairs men 's room in the Duval County courthouse . There 's a hole in the wall . Straight through to the next room . I spent five years listening to juries deliberate .
MILTON: I love it .
KEVIN: Love it all you want , just do n't epeat it . I 'm not sure the Florida Bar Association would appreciate it .
MILTON: You do n't really want to go back to Florida , do you ? Walk with me .
MILTON: What do you think ? Some people ca n't handle it .
KEVIN: It 's peaceful .
MILTON: Exactly . Fill in the resume . Tell me about your family . What does you father do ?
KEVIN: I never got to know my father . He passed away before I was born . My mom raised me . Just the two of us .
MILTON: She never remarried ?
KEVIN: She was n't married the first time .
MILTON: That ca n't be easy in Gainesville .
KEVIN: I do n't think it 's easy anywhere . Holy shit
MILTON: Little different when you 're looking down , is n't it ? Tell me about her . Your mother . What 's she like ?
KEVIN: She 's a preacher 's daughter . She 's tough . She 's worked in the same poultry plant for as long as I can remember . I think she 's up to eight-fifty an hour . She 's got a church she really likes , so she 's usually either there or they go out , they do a lot of voluntee work .
MILTON: 'Many are in high places , and of great renown but mysteries are evealed unto the meek . '
KEVIN: So they say .
MILTON: Did n't rub off on you ? The book ? The church ?
KEVIN: I 'm on parole . Early release fo time served .
MILTON: Lotta potential clients down there .
KEVIN: You do n't have to sell me on New York .
MILTON: You like it here , do n't you ?
KEVIN: Are we negotiating ?
MILTON: Always .
KEVIN: Why do you need a criminal department ?
MILTON: Because our clients break the law just like everyone else and I 'm tired of sending their business across the street .
KEVIN: Are you offering me a job ?
MILTON: I 'm thinking about it . You have the talent . I knew that before you got here . It 's the othe thing I wonder about .
KEVIN: What thing is that ?
MILTON: Pressure . Changes everything . Some people , you squeeze them , they focus . Some people fold . Can you summon your talent at will ? Can you deliver on deadline ? Can you sleep at night ?
KEVIN: When do we talk about money ?
MILTON: Money 's the easy part .
HEATH: I doubt it was at the top of his list when Mr. Milton bought the uilding , but it 's a great neighborhood for children .
JACKIE: You must be Mary Ann Welcome . I 'm Jackie Heath
MARY ANN: It 's so sweet of you to come by .
JACKIE: Please . We live across the hall .
MARY ANN: You 're kidding ?
HEATH: Right here .
KEVIN: So it 's just two apartments pe floor ?
JACKIE: You did n't tell them about the apartment ?
HEATH: I thought I 'd let it speak fo itself . Opening the door , and we enter
JACKIE: We had them paint everything white . Let you see it naked efore you pick your palette .
MARY ANN: What am I picking ?
JACKIE: Palette . Your colors .
HEATH: I need to warn you about one thing . There are going to be some very envious people at the firm . These apartments , there are n't many of them , it 's really a partner 's perk . You must 've made quite an impression .
JACKIE: Took us six years to get in here .
MARY ANN: Are you really this good ?

MILTON: There you go , Kevin . The whole team . I 'm trying to think how long it 's been since we were all together . All of us . Too long . I 'm looking around , I know some of you came from very far away to e with us here today . It 's appreciated . This room we 're in was built architecturally designed to promote healthy group dynamics . A psychic centrifuge . Makes you want to reach out , does n't it ? Inclusion . Commonality . Synergy . All that good shit . That 's what I 'm looking for today . Because when I hear stories the kind of stories I 've been hearing about backbiting , about partners not working together , departments cutting each other 's throats over clients , or worse I feel drained . It drains me . I feel empty . I feel as though I 've let you all down . We need something . A gesture . What do I need , Eddie ?
BARZOON: How about a public flogging ?
MILTON: Wait a minute . I got it . It 's perfect . It 's intimate . It 's quick . Does n't cost a thing . There 's a power to it . What is it ? Let 's hold hands . All of us . Together .
MILTON: Right now . Every person at this table take the hand of the person on either side Kevin finds Christabella 's hand at his side .

KEVIN: I guess it 'll do .
HEATH: Kevin Lomax . Pam Garrety .
PAM: In the pipeline . For now , we 'll just have you work pro hac vice . We 've petitioned Florida for a letter of good conduct . And I prepared , at Mr. Milton 's equest , an overview of the Moyez case .
KEVIN: The Moyez case ?
DRIVER: I got ta stick with the vehicle .
JUNKIE: Tell her turn that shit down ! I know what she 's doin ' ! That 's ight ! Tell 'em take that noise ack t'Africa 'fore I
KEVIN: I 'm looking for Phillipe Moyez . She moves aside . Kevin enters
WOMAN: Bhalla ! Bhalla ! Kevin taking a very deep breath , as we
KEVIN: Look , I 'm not sure I 'm making myself clear here .
BOY: Moyez . You need him . Speak wid him .
KEVIN: You 're saying he 's down here ? In the basement ? In the dark ?
BOY: Where ? Where you think ? Where you think me taking you ?
KEVIN: Mr. Moyez ? We 've never met . I 'm a lawyer . I 'm here about the animals .
MOYEZ: As you wish .
KEVIN: I 'll be arguing your case with the city . I need to ask you some questions . I 've done a little preliminary esearch precedent cases in the past that dealt with Santeria and Vou
MOYEZ: No . This is not Santeria . We are not Voodoo . Candomble . Obeayisne . None of that . We are much older . Before . Before all of it .
KEVIN: Okay . Is there a name ? Or
MOYEZ: We have papers . At your firm . We have the tax exemption .
KEVIN: Okay . I 'll get right into that . The animals . Let 's start with that , then .
MOYEZ: We have an investment in blood . Think of it as spiritual currency .
KEVIN: Look , Mr. Moyez , I 'm going to need your help with this .
MOYEZ: Yes . That 's very clear .
KEVIN: Perhaps we could start at the eginning ?
MOYEZ: What is the name of the man who will prosecute us ?
KEVIN: Merto . Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto .
MOYEZ: Bhalla . La chemise noire . Vite !
KEVIN: What are you doing , Mr. Moyez ?
MOYEZ: You can go now . You will have all the help I can give you .
PAM: What do you think ?
KEVIN: It 's a health code case . And it 's a loser . So what 's the point ? It 's a test , right ?
PAM: Is n't everything ?
KEVIN: The smart thing to do is make a deal . Plea him out and suppress the tape .
PAM: I 'm sure the D.A . 's waiting fo your call .
KEVIN: Yeah , well , let him wait . And you can tell Milton too . I did n't come to New York to plea argain .
PAM: It 's only a health code case .
KEVIN: Your Honor , the city timed this police action to catch my client exercising his constitutionally- protected right to religious freedom .
JUDGE SKLAR: This is a law protecting Koshe utchering .
KEVIN: Exactly , Your Honor . And I 'd like to move at this time for an immediate directed verdict fo dismissal .
JUDGE SKLAR: I happen to know a little bit about Kashrut law , Mr. Lomax .
KEVIN: I 'm aware of that , Your Honor , which is why I feel confident in equesting a dismissal .
JUDGE SKLAR: Mr. Merto ?
MILTON: Bravo , Kevin . Bravo . Pamela , you 're looking lovely . Satisfied , Phillipe ?
MOYEZ: Always .
MILTON: Kevin , what can I say ? Outstanding .
KEVIN: You got ta be kidding .
MILTON: What do you think ? We 're giving you away ? He 's paying us in goat 's blood ? I 'm billing you out at four-hundred an hour , my friend . I do n't see a whole lot of pro bono work in you immediate future . Seriously , what I like , you got in there with him . Inside the cage . That 's instinct . Ca n't be taught . You got ta hear that on your own . It 's got ta be in your blood . It 's molecular . I bet I 've got five thousand lawyers working around the planet . I could n't name ten could n't name three I 'd trust with Moyez .
KEVIN: So what the hell are they doing ?
MILTON: What are they doing ? They 're corporate lawyers , what do you think they 're doing ? They 're usy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi- colon . They 're doing needlepoint . Push button battles . Push button wars . Armies that get so fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who won . No pain . No sound . No smell . One big , multinational circle jerk . You , on the othe hand , you 're on the slaughterhouse floor . You ca n't help but smell your clients .
KEVIN: I figure you came to court to make sure I did n't fuck this up .
MILTON: Maybe I did . But do n't get too cocky . No matter how good you are . Do n't let them see you coming . That 's the gaff , my friend make yourself small . Be the hick . The cripple . The nerd . The leper . The shit- kicking surfer . Look at me I 've been underestimated from day one . Do I look like a master of the universe ? That 's your only weakness as far as I can tell .
KEVIN: What 's that ?
MILTON: The look . The Florida stud thing . 'Scuse me , ma'am , did I leave my oots under your bed ? '
KEVIN: Never worked a jury did n't have a woman .
MILTON: You know what you 're missing ? What I have ? This beautiful girl she 's just fucked me every way she knows how we 're done she 's walking to the bathroom she turns back and there I am . It 's me . And she smiles it 's like a veil coming down across her face and that smile , that 's a question mark , because she 's looking at me , she 's wondering , how did that happen ? And see , ight there , from that moment on , she 's got a secret . I 'm the hand up Mona Lisa 's skirt . I 'm the whisper in Nefertitti 's ear . I 'm a surprise . They never see me coming . That 's what you 're missing . Milton escaping across the street .
KEVIN: So why did you come down today ?
MILTON: Because I knew it was gon na be good . Because I knew I was gon na like it . That you would shine that we would take this walk that we 'd really talk . Why I came down ? You want the truth ? I 'm an aging , hipster plutocrat . I came up from nothing . From dirt . I 'm warming my hands on your talent Where 's the chicken ?
KEVIN: What ? A CHINESE MAN sits in a doorway
MILTON: Where 's the chicken ? The chicken that plays tic-tac-toe . He used to be right here .
CHINESE MAN: No , you passed it . Back that way .
MILTON: There 's a chicken , he 's famous , he plays tic-tac-toe . He neve loses . Hey . Like you . Right ? Look , I 'm rambling because I 'm excited . You 're in the part of the game I like best . The realm of the True Believers . You are a believer , are n't you ?
KEVIN: I believe in the presumption of innocence .
MILTON: Better a hundred guilty men go free than a single innocent be executed .
KEVIN: Something like that .
MILTON: No . Exactly like that . It 's faith . You 're either in or out . You ca n't believe a little bit .
KEVIN: I was kidding .
MILTON: You 're not here to amuse me . See , that 's why people hate lawyers . So many of us have lost our faith . Do n't let that happen to you . Token ?
KEVIN: Excuse me ?
MILTON: Learn the subways , Kevin . Use them . Stay in the trenches . Kevin taking the token , as we
KEVIN: Mare Mare ?
KEVIN: What 's all this ?
MARY ANN: Oh , that It was gon na be a nursery , but then I remembered you 'd have to be home long enough to knock me up , so now I 'm thinking of building a law library .
KEVIN: You can handle this .
MARY ANN: Say something nice .
KEVIN: Something nice .
MARY ANN: Promise me you wo n't leave me alone in there .
KEVIN: Promise .
MARY ANN: How the hell did we get here ?
KEVIN: Instinct .
DIANA: There you are ! Diana Barzoon , Eddie 's wife . Come on , you two . Everyone ca n't wait to meet you .
MARY ANN: Not yet . I do n't think so .
DIANA: Come with me . Instantly . I 'm borrowing your wife
BARZOON: Be gentle , honey . These are normal people .
KEVIN: Excuse me ?
BARZOON: Is this your first marriage ?
MARY ANN: Who is that ?
JACKIE: My God , girl
DIANA: You have n't met him yet ?
MARY ANN: Who is he ?
DIANA: I swear he can hear us .
JACKIE: Hell , he can smell us .
MILTON: Mary Ann ? John Milton I was hoping we 'd meet tonight . And here you are , already swimming with the sharks .
MARY ANN: Deadbeats . I mean , that 's what it comes down to . You can call yourself a finance trainee , o a financial resources adviser , or whatever , you 're still spending most of your day trying to hammer car payments out of deadbeats . No deadbeats here tonight .
MILTON: You 'd be surprised . There 's a lot more fear in this room than you 'd think .
MARY ANN: What do these people have to be afraid of ?
MILTON: Each other . Themselves . Why ? What scares you ?
MARY ANN: Not knowing who the deadbeats are .
MILTON: You 'll figure that out . There 's only one thing worth being frightened of anyway , and that 's eing alone . Truly and finally alone .
MARY ANN: Yes . I think you 're right .
MILTON: You know what terrifies me ? Responsibility .
MARY ANN: For what ?
MILTON: For what . For you . Let 's be honest , I 've changed your life . Changed it forever . There 's een a seismic shift in you existence and I 'm responsible . And you 've never even met me . We 're talking for the very first time . How insane is that ?
MARY ANN: It 's a wonderful opportunity fo Kevin .
MILTON: Kevin . Please . I 'm not worried about Kevin . He buys a few new suits . Learns a few new tricks . He 's there . I do n't worry about Kevin . What about you ?
MARY ANN: I 'm not leaving a lot behind .
MILTON: You must have family .
MARY ANN: Bad subject . I have n't spoken to my folks in a long time . My sister ran all the way to Germany .
MILTON: Whoaa I got ta think about that . I had you down as daddy 's little girl , you know ? The princess . Sugar plum snapshots . Pastel edspreads . Cinnamon cookies .
MARY ANN: I tell Kevin the only thing worse than not having a father was having mine .
MILTON: So you 've got a lot at stake here . You 've made a real commitment .
MARY ANN: I guess I have .
MILTON: It 's not gon na be like Gainesville , but then you know that already .
MARY ANN: We 're gon na be fine . It 's gon na e great .
MILTON: If it is n't , will you come to me ? Let me help ? I 'd feel a lot less esponsible . Will you do that for me ?
MARY ANN: Sure .
MILTON: The worst vice is advice , right ? But can I make a suggestion ? It 's about your hair , some people are sensitive , that 's why I ask .
MARY ANN: No . I mean , go ahead . You do n't like it ?
MILTON: You have shoulders nobody can see . Pull it back .
MARY ANN: You mean , you want me to pull my hair back ?
MILTON: If I do it , everyone in this room that 's pretending not to watch us will assume we 're fucking o something . Pull back your hair . Take a look . See . That 's it . Is n't that incredible ? You need to cut your hair .
MARY ANN: You 're kidding .
MILTON: A woman 's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique . And her neck , if she 's alive , has the very mystery of a order town . It 's the no man 's land in the battle etween mind and body . You know , your natural colo would really bring out your eyes Mary Ann frozen there , as we
CHRISTABELLA: Do you have this view ?
KEVIN: Sorry ?
CHRISTABELLA: From your terrace , is this you view ?
KEVIN: Sort of . Not exactly . I 'm about twelve floors down . What about you ?
CHRISTABELLA: No , I live downtown . This is the family building .
KEVIN: Sounds like fun . Downtown , I mean . I 'm just getting to know the city .
CHRISTABELLA: Is it everything you expected ?
KEVIN: More .
CHRISTABELLA: May we always have more than we expect . Salute .
KEVIN: Amen .
CHRISTABELLA: Are you alone ?
KEVIN: You mean , tonight ?
CHRISTABELLA: Is your wife a jealous woman ? Silly question . We 're all jealous , are n't we ?
KEVIN: I doubt it .
CHRISTABELLA: You like to be on top , do n't you ?
KEVIN: Excuse me ?
CHRISTABELLA: Of the situation . You prefer to e on top .
KEVIN: Depends on the view .
MILTON: I see the future of this law firm . Christabella , cara , prestamelo pe favore , pe lo riporto piu tardi .
CHRISTABELLA: It 's a boring party , anyway . Ciao . Kevin ca n't help watching her walk away .
MILTON: Look , we got ta talk . You gra Heath and Eddie Barzoon and get up to my place right away . And let 's be quiet about it .
MARY ANN: Have you seen Kevin ?
MAN #1: Do n't think he 's here . Suddenly , a WOMAN 's head rises INTO FRAME
WOMAN: It 's just us
MAN #2: But feel free to join in
KEVIN: Is there more to it ?
BARZOON: Just this room .
KEVIN: And a bedroom ?
BARZOON: No bedroom .
KEVIN: Where does he sleep ?
HEATH: Who said he sleeps ?
KEVIN: Where does he fuck ?
BARZOON: What 's up , John ?
MILTON: How many hours did we bill Alex Cullen last year ?
HEATH: Sixteen thousand , two hundred and forty-two .
BARZOON: What the fuck did he do now ?
MILTON: Alex Cullen has just been charged with murdering his ex- wife , her stepson , and a maid .
BARZOON: When did this happen ?
MILTON: Just now . Tonight . I already sent Pam downtown to make bail arrangements .
BARZOON: They 'll fucking crucify him . They 'll get in line . I got ta call Meisel
MILTON: No . I want Kevin on this case .
BARZOON: I hope you 're kidding . Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan triple murder ? With Kevin ? You 're dreaming .
MILTON: I 've shaken hands with every marquee defense attorney in town . I take Kevin and I do n't look ack .
BARZOON: You 're a great judge of talent , John . You 're the master . I just do n't see it coming together .
MILTON: I want you on board , Eddie .
KEVIN: Look , I appreciate the vote of confidence , but maybe Eddie 's got a point here .
MILTON: We can get this case . The man 's our client .
BARZOON: He 's a business client .
MILTON: We know him better than he knows himself . We have the inside track . We have the best damn trial lawyer in the city . It 's ours to lose .
BARZOON: Tell it to Cullen .
MILTON: No . That 's up to Kevin .
MILTON: That 's Pam calling Are we fighting for this , or not ?
MARY ANN: You left me there . I had a fucking panic attack until Jackie told me where you were . Three hours ? You do n't even call ?
KEVIN: Stop . Reset . I 'm upstairs , I 'm with Milton and Barzoon and there is a very good possibility that I 'm about to catch a triple homicide defendant who also happens to be the largest real estate developer in the city . I had to bail on the party !
MARY ANN: You bailed on me !
KEVIN: Mare did you hear me ?
MARY ANN: I was all by myself !
KEVIN: For three whole hours You got ta be kidding , right ?
CULLEN TOWERS: `` The Next Great Address ''
CULLEN: You may be right , but look at it from my point of view . I 'm sure he 's a whiz kid . I believe you . But this is my ass we 're talking . Jesus , Eddie
MILTON: Alex , you know how this town works . You 've got enemies you never heard of . And now ? Now you 're down ? I 'd prepare for a class-A , New York pig-fuck . You 're going to have to ask yourself who you really trust . Who do you trust , Alex ?
CULLEN: I do n't know I got ta look around .
KEVIN: You do n't have time to shop , Mr. Cullen . Jury selection started this morning at every breakfast table in the city . You lost round one . This is what people know . They know you and your wife were living separately . They see this maid Elucinda a sixty-eight-year-old grandmother supporting seven children . And then there 's you stepson , a ten-year-old with a ullet in his brain . Those are already powerful images in the mind of the public .
CULLEN: I did n't kill anybody .
KEVIN: I 'm telling you how it looks . You discover the crime . You call it in . You 've got blood on you person and clothes , and and your prints are on the murder weapon .
CULLEN: How do you know that ?
KEVIN: There 's a second print in blood it 's a partial of a hand on the wall next to th
CULLEN: I have keys ! I called the cops from the house ! I touched the goddamn wall ! I was panicked ! I panicked !
KEVIN: We need twelve people who can see past all that . I 'd get out in front of this fast .
CULLEN: I panicked ! Is that a crime ? I touched the wall !
BARZOON: He 's right , Alex . People need to hear these things .
KEVIN: You 're not happy tomorrow ? The next day ? We 'll move over . But ight now this moment you need immediate representation .
CULLEN: I 've got a fourteen-year-old stepdaughter who I care more about than anything in the world . They wo n't let me call her from downtown . They wo n't let me talk to her after I 'm out . I got ta go deal with that first .
KEVIN: We need to issue a statement .
MILTON: He 's a winner , Alex . And they 'll never see him coming .
CULLEN: I 'm gon na make some very tough phone calls . Then I 'm gon na take a pill and try to get some sleep . My place . Eight A.M. tomorrow . Alone . And you better be every fucking inch as good as you think you are .
MARY ANN: This is three thousand dollars .
JACKIE: Know what you need to do ? Buy it . Wear it once . And then throw it away . That 'll loosen you up .
DIANA: I say spend it all . If you 're never gon na see your husband , you might as well have a relationship with his money . I swear , if he was n't afraid of me shooting my mouth off , Eddie would 've put a cellulite clause in the pre-nup .
JACKIE: Dr. Robert , I 'm telling you , he 's the miracle man . You 've seen my new tits , I mean who does it etter than that ?
DIANA: It 's not my tits I 'm worried about .

CHRISTABELLA: What an incredible situation , even if you lose you become a star .
KEVIN: What if I win ?
CHRISTABELLA: If you win If you win it 's everything .
KEVIN: Any advice ?
CHRISTABELLA: Cullen is a pig . He 's a pig eyond reasonable doubt . I suggest you keep him as far away from the jury as possible .
KEVIN: I 'll keep it in mind .
CHRISTABELLA: You can look all you want , but I do n't fuck married men .
KEVIN: What a relief . I was starting to think you were perfect .
PAM: Your wife is on the phone . She sounds upset Christabella smiling as Kevin rushes off .
MARY ANN: I do n't care if they can hear me ! I do n't care ! I do n't like it here . And these women , my God I mean , I 'm seeing things for crissake !
KEVIN: You just left them in the store ?
MARY ANN: Yes !
KEVIN: Look , calm down , all right ? Listen to me Mare ? First , you do this radical thing with your hair
MARY ANN: You hate it .
KEVIN: Stop . I think it 's fine . But I also think it 's traumatic . You 've got the pressure of fitting in with new friends , a new place add three bottles of wine and
MARY ANN: No ! It was n't the wine . It was n't the wine or my hair o talking to Kathy , because I know that 's what you 're gon na say
KEVIN: What about Kathy ?
MARY ANN: What about her ? She 's pregnant again .
KEVIN: Oh , and that 's got nothing to do with it
MARY ANN: Kevin , I never see you anymore . Now that you 've got this big case , it 's just only gon na get worse . I do n't know anybody here . These women scare the living shit out of me . If you can believe it , I 'm actually looking forward to having your mother come and visit .
KEVIN: What about the apartment ?
MARY ANN: Exactly ! You just go out you uy a few new suits and you 're fine . I 've got this whole place to fill up and I know we have all this money and it 's supposed to e fun , but it is n't ! It 's like a test ! The whole thing is like one big test ! I 'm lonely .
KEVIN: Let 's make a baby .
MARY ANN: Do n't tease me .
KEVIN: I would n't do that . Unless you asked .
MARY ANN: You hate my hair , do n't you ?
KEVIN: Right here . Mary Ann does n't look so sure .
CULLEN: I do n't know why I picked it up it was before I saw Elucinda 's ody and then , I mean we 've been over this
KEVIN: You kneeled down to pick it up ?
CULLEN: You work late . You come home . You walk in . Everybody 's dead . It 's not something you plan for .
KEVIN: Back up . Two prints by the gun . Right knee . Right hand . It 's a strange move you must 've made to pick it up .
CULLEN: The blood , I do n't know , maybe I was trying to avoid the blood .
KEVIN: I 'm trying to picture it Your hand came from inside and underneath .
CULLEN: You want to see ? Here I 'll fucking show you .
KEVIN: Whose gun is that , Alex ?
CULLEN: It 's mine .
KEVIN: Are you out of your mind ? You 're charged in a triple homicide , you 're walking around with a forty-five ?
CULLEN: I 've had nine death threats .
KEVIN: Give it over . Now . Gim me the gun .
CULLEN: I got ta protect myself .
KEVIN: That 's my job . When the case is over you can have it back . This is a dealbreaker , Alex . Cullen hands him the gun .
CULLEN: So what 's next ?
KEVIN: We need to talk to your assistant .
CULLEN: Call her .

CULLEN: Melissa , yeah . She 's okay . She 's a real straight arrow .
KEVIN: So we 're going to talk to her and you 're not going to talk to anybody . Okay ?
CULLEN: No comment .
MELISSA: Would my babysitter have to testify ?
KEVIN: We need her to establish the time you returned home .
MELISSA: She does n't have her green card is why I ask . I do n't want her to get in trouble .
KEVIN: Tell you what , Melissa , let 's talk to her first . See where she stands and take it from there .
PAM: I 'll make sure Melissa gets down to the car .
MELISSA: Mr. Cullen did n't kill those people .
KEVIN: That 's why we 're all working so hard .
BARZOON: Okay , Excelsior Insurance , who 's handling that ? All this has to go . Guatemala , Sudan , Cyprus Let 's stay organized here . Martin , no . Devada Holdings . That 's all you 're doing . Believe me , it 'll take all night .

CULLEN: I get one supervised hour a week with my stepdaughter . This is it . You better have a great reason to call me out .
KEVIN: Your wife , the day she was killed , had lunch with a friend . She says and I quote 'Alex is fucking around and I can prove it . '
CULLEN: Hearsay . Never gets in .
KEVIN: Wrong answer . Your prenuptial agreement is on file at the firm . The contract is null and void in the event of marital infidelity . You fuck around , she gets rich . That 's a motive , Alex . What do I need to know ?
CULLEN: Melissa . My assistant . She 's not even that good a fuck .
KEVIN: And , on the night in question ?
CULLEN: I was boning my assistant while my wife was getting shot .
KEVIN: I 've got to re-interview Melissa .
CULLEN: Forget it . We 're not telling that story .
KEVIN: Juries want honesty . Fuck with that at your peril . Cullen turns something more important
CULLEN: Allesandra . Wait
KEVIN: Arthur
CULLEN: Not now .
THERAPIST: Time 's up , Mr. Cullen .
CULLEN: Allesandra . Please Kevin watching Cullen rush away , as we

MRS. LOMAX: Always did like to stick his nose in a camera .
FEENEY: And how are you , Mrs. Lomax ? Did you have a fine dinner ?
MRS. LOMAX: I surely did . Are you hungry ?
FEENEY: No , I 'm fine . Thank you .

MRS. LOMAX: No .

MARY ANN: That what you 're doing when you 're working late ?
KEVIN: What are we talking about ?
MARY ANN: You know exactly what I 'm talking about .
KEVIN: That 's ridiculous .
MARY ANN: I 'm going to bed . 'Night , Alice
MRS. LOMAX: 'Night . Mary Ann exits .
MRS. LOMAX: I 'm worried about her . You should n't fight like that .
KEVIN: That 's not a fight , Ma , it 's marriage . Not exactly your area of expertise .
MRS. LOMAX: Are you happy here ?
KEVIN: What ?
MRS. LOMAX: Are you happy here ?
KEVIN: You 're kidding , right ? Am I happy ? Every now and then I look around and I think my mama must be praying awful hard for me , 'cause I died and went to heaven . Am I happy ?
MRS. LOMAX: You were always running somewhere .
KEVIN: I guess I finally got there . Look , I 'm sorry about being so usy this week . Maybe Saturday I can get some time off and
MRS. LOMAX: Do n't worry on it . I love you more than anything in the whole world . You know that , do n't you ?
KEVIN: I love you too , Ma . Kevin turning out the lights , as we
KEVIN: Shit !
MRS. LOMAX: I 'm going home , Kevin .

MRS. LOMAX: I do n't feel right .
KEVIN: You just got here . Look , I 'm late and I just got my teeth kicked in on the front page , so I got ta run . We 'll talk later .
MRS. LOMAX: I have to go , Kevin . I miss my church .
KEVIN: Ma , this is New York , there must e twenty-thousand goddamn churches . Take your pick .
MRS. LOMAX: You need to do a better job with Mary Ann . She 's not well . This place is n't good for her .
KEVIN: So stay . Take care of her if you 're so concerned ! Help me out .
MRS. LOMAX: I 'll take her home if you let me .
KEVIN: This is home . You understand ? This is where we live ! I 'm not going back to Gainesville . Unbelievable .
MRS. LOMAX: 'Wide is the gate , and broad is the way that leadeth to temptation . '
KEVIN: It 's a little early for scripture . I 'm going to work . You can do whatever you want . Mrs. Lomax watching him go , as we
MELISSA: I ca n't do it . It 's one thing to have an affair with your boss , it 's another to have to tell the world in a murder case .
KEVIN: We have to bring it out , Melissa .
MELISSA: My ex-husband would have a field day with this .
KEVIN: A man 's life is at stake . You 're our whole case . Melissa looking away , as we
WEAVER: there is nothing vague o exploratory about this subpoena equest , Your Honor . We 're specifically asking for any and all documents relating to Devada Holdings . It 's taken six months and seventeen separate motions and we still do n't know who 's esponsible here . We 've got a paper trail here that seems to stretch into eternity !
WOMAN JUDGE: Mr. Barzoon ?
BARZOON: Ca n't turn over what you do n't have , Your Honor . We 've been conducting a comprehensive search of our records and I 'm sorry to say it 's a great deal less than Mr. Weaver would suggest .
WEAVER: Your Honor , this is outrageous . We need to get in there and seize these documents before there 's nothing left !
BARZOON: Your Honor , it 's exactly these types of insulting accusations
WOMAN JUDGE: Enough . Both of you . Put it on paper . I 'll read it .
WEAVER: Your Honor
BARZOON: Forget about lunch . This guy Weaver is running me ragged . A REPORTER pulls up alongside excited
REPORTER: Kevin . Nancy Osborne , Metro News . How are you ?
KEVIN: Busy .
REPORTER: We had a report of a private plane at Teterboro airport ready to take Alexander Cullen out of the coun
KEVIN: Mr. Cullen is innocent . He 's not going anywhere . He 's been eleased on a two million dolla ond . He looks forward to having his day in court . Thank you .
REPORTER: Kevin , is there any truth to
KEVIN: I 'm in the middle of a meeting . Call my office . Schedule an interview . Or else forget it .
BARZOON: You 're good at that .
KEVIN: You 're not gon na have time to help me on Cullen , are you ?
BARZOON: No . Just then , Weaver comes rumbling past
WEAVER: Devada Holdings , Eddie . Look in your rearview window , I 'm right ehind you .
REPORTER #2: Kevin , Chuck Higgery , Action News . Have you spoken with Alex Cullen concerning the D.A . 's report
REPORTER #3: Kevin , just a statement
BARZOON: Got ta go .
MARY ANN: I dreamt about this . Right here . It 's not a dream if it 's true .
KEVIN: Tell me this is the medication .
MARY ANN: You wo n't stay with me now .
KEVIN: Look , let 's get you undressed and in the tub . Okay ?
MARY ANN: You wo n't stay . I know you . You 'll leave me now for sure . Get-away-from-me !
KEVIN: Okay . I 'm confused . Why ? What is it now ? What the fuck is it today , Mare ? I swea to God , I 'm calling this doctor , I 'm gon na find out what the hell they 're giving you .
MARY ANN: They took my ovaries . I told you ! My sisters have seven children etween them . My mother had Derek when she was forty-five . You could set a clock by my periods .
KEVIN: What are you talking about ?
MARY ANN: I ca n't have children !
KEVIN: Says who ?
MARY ANN: The doctor ! The other doctor . I was there today . Non-specific ovarian failure .
KEVIN: That 's ridiculous . The PHONE begins to RING across the room .
MARY ANN: I know you . You 'll leave me .
KEVIN: Mary Ann
MARY ANN: It 's these monsters , Kevin . I dreamt this
KEVIN: Uh huh . For sleep . And she can take that during the day ? No , she wo n't be driving . I 'm gon na have the pharmacy call you right back . Thanks . He thinks , he 's not sure , he thinks it could be some kind of hormonal imbalance .
MILTON: I 'm taking you off the case .
KEVIN: What ?
MILTON: I want you to drop this case .
KEVIN: This case ? Cullen ? John , I 've got a jury showing up this morning .
MILTON: Do you love this woman ?
KEVIN: Yes . Of course I do .
MILTON: Kevin , she 's sick . Everyone will understand . I 'll understand .
KEVIN: What about Cullen ?
MILTON: We 'll find someone new . You consult . You live to fight another day .
KEVIN: I put together a great jury .
MILTON: It 's a disappointment . We all have them . Embrace it . Use it . You move on .
KEVIN: Hang on , we got ta talk about this .
MILTON: What 's to talk ? It 's your wife , man . And she 's very sick . And that 's got ta come first . Are you telling me the possibility of leaving the case has neve crossed your mind ?
KEVIN: You know what scares me ? I quit the case . She gets better . And I hate her for it . I do n't want to resent her , John . I 've got a winner here . I got ta nail this fucker down , do it fast , and put it behind me . Just get it done . Then put all my energy into her .
MILTON: I guess you have thought about it . I stand corrected .
BROYGO: And when all that evidence is laid before you , when all these pieces weave together , you will conclude you will know that Alexander Cullen is guilty of murdering three people in cold lood with malice aforethought .
JUDGE POE: Mr. Lomax We can break for lunch now , or you can do a stop and start
KEVIN: If it 's a choice , I 'll go now . I wo n't be as long as Mr. Broygo .
JUDGE POE: Proceed .
KEVIN: We just spent our morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk about his 'evidence ' . What he neglected to tell you is what this case is eally about . He left out the most important fact of all Alex Cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place . Now , Alex Cullen has done a lot of things I do n't like . He 's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives . He 's been a destructive force in the lives of his step-children . He 's cheated the city . His partners . His employees . He 's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years . I do n't like those things . I do n't expect you to like them . There will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less . But this is n't a popularity contest . It 's a murder trial and Alex Cullen has n't killed anybody .
CULLEN: What the fuck was that ? Are you out of your fucking mind ? They fucking hate me ! Kevin one push Cullen sent flying .
KEVIN: Listen to me like you 've neve listened to anybody before . I 'm going to bust my ass to make sure they hate you . Because as long as you 're out boning Melissa , you 're not home killing your wife .
CULLEN: Why did n't you tell me before ?
KEVIN: Then it does n't look spontaneous .
TECHNICIAN: The victim ? Of course not .
KEVIN: And there 's a two hour window in which to place these murders .
TECHNICIAN: Yes .
KEVIN: So , you 've got absolutely no way to determine the condition of the victims when Alexander Cullen put his hand on that wall .
BARZOON: Saw you go in .
KEVIN: What 's up ?
BARZOON: Congratulations .
KEVIN: It 's not over yet .
BARZOON: I 'm not talking about the trial .
KEVIN: What are you talking about ?
BARZOON: How the fuck does your name get on the firm 's charter ?
KEVIN: What ?
BARZOON: Looks like it 's been there fo years . Now you 're a partner ? When did that happen ? I am still the managing director of this firm . You want my job ? Take me head on . Backdoor me one more time and I 'll take your partnership papers and stuff 'em down your throat .
KEVIN: I do n't know what you 're talking about , but I sure as hell do n't like your tone of voice .
BARZOON: Bullshit .
KEVIN: You got a problem with documents , I suggest you put together one of your late-night shredding sessions .
BARZOON: You think you 're tough enough to un this firm ? Fine . You tell Milton next time Weave calls maybe I pick up the phone .
MILTON: Was he drunk ?
KEVIN: I doubt it . He was going running . What the hell was he talking about ?
MILTON: Eddie 's gotten himself into trouble again . And he wants me to save him . And I ca n't .
KEVIN: Why does he think I 'm after his job ?
MILTON: Do you have any experience with manic-depression ?
KEVIN: Not directly , no .
MILTON: You do now .
MARY ANN: Eddie Barzoon . I 've nursed him through two divorces , a cocaine rehab , and a pregnant receptionist . God 's creature , right ?
MILTON: I 'll tell you , Kevin , because I know you 're into theology . When you 've seen when you 've epresented when you 've dealt with as many people as I have ove the years , finally you say to yourself , 'God must 've been awfully bored . '
OLD MAN: Gim me your watch .
BARZOON: You want the watch , old man ? Come and get it .
KEVIN: I 'm gon na , I 'm gon na go downstairs now . Put this stuff away . Ice cream 's already melting . Milton watching him walk away , as we
MELISSA: Yes .
KEVIN: Mr. Cullen , though , he 's not just your lover , is he ? He 's the boss .
MELISSA: Yes .
KEVIN: So two hours go by before you act on his request ?
MELISSA: Yes , I went up at six-ten . I knew it was six-ten , they had weathe coming on the news . I remember Cut off by
KEVIN: Okay . Stop . This prosecutor is no fool . He 's gon na change tempo , attitude , tone of voice he 's gon na come out with questions you never thought of , just to screw you up . So what do we do ?
MELISSA: Yes and no answers . Stay calm .
KEVIN: Exactly . Is it your testimony , Ms. Block , that between the hours of six-ten and nine-forty you were engaged in sexual congress with the defendant ?
MELISSA: Yes .
KEVIN: At any point during this three hour marathon , Ms. Block , did you lose sight of the defendant ?
MELISSA: No .
KEVIN: Did he use the bathroom ?
MELISSA: Yes .
KEVIN: Is he circumcised ? You understand the question ?
MELISSA: Yes .
KEVIN: So is he cut or not ?
MELISSA: Yes .
KEVIN: Which is it ? Silence . Melissa looks away .
MELISSA: I 've had it up to here with this fucking game . Why do n't you take your questions and shove 'em up your ass .
CHRISTABELLA: Oh , Kevin
KEVIN: What 's happened ?
CHRISTABELLA: Eddie Barzoon
KEVIN: What about him ?
CHRISTABELLA: He 's dead . He was killed .
KEVIN: When ?
HEATH: Last night in the park . He was unning if you can believe it .
KEVIN: Who ?
LAWYER #1: Two old , homeless crazies . Pam coming through the hallway like steel
PAM: Kevin Kevin , I 'm sorry , but you 're due in court in thirty minutes .
MELISSA: Are we through here , or what ?
PAM: I 'll bring Melissa down in the car , but you better get going .
MILTON: I want you to put Eddie aside . Let me worry about it . You got ta deal with Cullen now . Marshal your strength . Prioritize . Conserve your energy .
KEVIN: I ca n't put her on the stand .
MILTON: What choice do we have ?
KEVIN: I know she 's lying .
MILTON: Because she did n't answer you fast enough ? Did she lie to you ? No . She said nothing . The fact is , you 'll never know .
KEVIN: He killed those people .
MILTON: You really believe that ?
KEVIN: Cullen set me up . Melissa , the whole thing , I know it .
MILTON: Look , you got ta go with your gut .
KEVIN: That 's your advice ?
MILTON: I 'll back you either way . Hey , you think I have n't lost before ? We talked about this , Kevin . Pressure . Take a big whiff .
JUDGE POE: Mr. Lomax , you may call your next witness .
JUDGE POE: Counselor

NURSE: Sign there And there And one more She 's calm now so this might be a good time to say good night . Kevin nods . Stands , moving now into
MARY ANN: I know why this is happening .
KEVIN: They want you to go to sleep .
MARY ANN: It 's the money , Kevin . Blood money . We just drank it down . Both of us . We knew it . Winning those cases , taking the money . We knew they were guilty . But you kept winning . Every time .

MRS. LOMAX: I could 've packed that up for you .
MRS. LOMAX: I wish you'da let me help you .
KEVIN: Finish the story . Nineteen-sixty-four . You 're in New York . There 's a waiter in a estaurant . Finish the story .
MRS. LOMAX: He talked to me . Nobody 'd eve eally talked to me before . Sixteen years old , a thousand miles away from home , somebody takes an interest Working so hard , putting himself through school , I 'd never met anybody like that . Knew the Bible , every word , just knew it by heart . Every meal , there he was , at my ear and I just I did n't want that week to ever end . But it did . He came to say goodbye , it was late , and I started to cry and he said not to worry , 'Behold , I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves . ' And that just stopped me cold because we 'd spent that whole day at Bible study eading Matthew Ten and there was just no way for him to know about that , so I was I took it as a sign . I let him in . And then everything was different . He was cruel . He was so cruel and I was so ashamed , I thought I 'd die
KEVIN: I want to hear you say it .
MRS. LOMAX: His face that night I knew it was him and the same time I was confused and you were so proud you 'd come to New York and done all this on your own , I did n't have the heart to tell you
KEVIN: Say it .
MRS. LOMAX: you wondered yourself the apartment , the money , all this attention , everything out of nowhere Milton . He 's your father . Somehow he found us . Tracked you down .
KEVIN: No .
MRS. LOMAX: What do you mean ?
KEVIN: He 's always been there . I know that now . Watching . Waiting . He 's been playing us like a game . Jerking us around . Destroying Mary Ann Kevin stands . Quiet fury . A machine .
MRS. LOMAX: What are you doing ?
KEVIN: I got ta go .
MRS. LOMAX: No let it alone ! Stay with me . Forget about him ! We can leave here . We can go home ! We do n't ever have to see him again !
KEVIN: I ca n't do that . You go home . Pray for Mary Ann .
MRS. LOMAX: Kevin , please Honey ! I love you !
PAM: There you are Look at you you 're terrified . Not to worry . He 'll take that fea away . You do n't ever have to be frightened again . Go on , he 's waiting Kevin turning and something is very wrong
MILTON: I do n't make things happen . Does n't work like that . Free will it 's like butterfly wings one touch and it never gets off the ground . I only set the stage . You pull your own strings .
KEVIN: What did you do to Mary Ann ?
MILTON: A gun ? In here ?
KEVIN: What did you do to my wife ?
MILTON: On a scale of one to ten , ten eing the most depraved acts of sexual theater , one being an average Friday night run-through at the Lomax household , I 'd say Six .
KEVIN: Who are you ?
MILTON: Never lost a case . Why ? Why ? Because you 're so fucking good ? Yes . But why ?
KEVIN: Because you 're my father .
MILTON: Well , I 'm a little more than that . Awful hot in that courtroom , was n't it ? 'What 's the game plan , Kevin ? ' 'It was a nice run , Kevin . Had to close out someday . '
KEVIN: Who are you ?
MILTON: I have so many names .
KEVIN: Satan .
MILTON: Call me Dad .
KEVIN: Mary Ann , Barzoon , Weaver
MILTON: Come on . You 're not listening . Blaming me for Mary Ann ? I hope you 're kidding . You could 've saved her any time you liked . She only wanted love . But you knew it would n't really work out , did n't you ? Mary Ann in New York ? Face it , you started looking to better- deal her the minute you got here .
KEVIN: That 's a lie .
MILTON: Hey , it 's not that you did n't care for her , it 's just you were a little bit more involved with someone else . Yourself .
KEVIN: What the hell do you know about love ?
MILTON: Bio-chemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate . Do n't be such a fucking chump . There 's only one real sickness in all of creation and that is self- delusion . I told you to take care of your wife that the world would understand . And you made a choice . 'You know what scares me , John ? I leave the case , she gets etter and I hate her for it ' Remember ?
KEVIN: You set me up . It 's entrapment .
MILTON: Who told you to pull out the stops for Mr. Gettys ? And Moyez the direction you took Snake handlers , Popes and swamis all feeding at the same trough whose ideas were those ? And then Cullen knowing he 's guilty seeing those pictures putting that lying bitch on the stand What did I say , Kevin ? Maybe it was time to lose , right ? You did n't think so .
KEVIN: That 's my job . That 's what I do !
MILTON: Exactly ! Vanity is definitely my favorite sin . Self love . It 's so basic . What a drug . Cheap , all-natural , and right at your fingertips . Pride . That 's where you 're strongest . And believe me , I understand . Work for someone else ? Hey , I could n't hack it . 'Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven . '
KEVIN: What do you want from me ?
MILTON: What do I want ? I want you to be yourself !
CHRISTABELLA: Surprise .
MILTON: What do you think , Kevin ? What a scene , huh ?
CHRISTABELLA: Do n't let him scare you .
MILTON: Wait till you meet her mother .
KEVIN: It is a test , is n't it ? The whole game , you sitting there , keeping score .
MILTON: No . That 's the other guy . I do n't judge anybody . As far as I 'm concerned , everyone 's a winner .
MILTON: I 'm here , on the ground , my nose in it since the whole damn thing egan . Why ? Because I worship man himself . And it 's my time now . Our time .
CHRISTABELLA: Anybody want a drink ? I 'm having a drink .
KEVIN: This is some pitch . You must need me pretty bad . What do you want ?
MILTON: Eddie was right . Your name is on the partnership charter . I want you to take over the firm . You and your sister .
KEVIN: Is that it ?
MILTON: No . She 's ovulating . Right now .
KEVIN: What ?
MILTON: Your vanity is justified , Kevin , you 're the seed to a new future . Your son will sit at the head of all tables . You hold a special place in the history of all things .
KEVIN: You want a child .
MILTON: I want a family .
KEVIN: The Antichrist .

HANS: Check on all the othersdo n't use the radio . See if he 's lying
MCCLANE: I would n't think of leaving , Hans . Unless you want to open the front door ?

FRANCO: We have to find him and shut him up ! He 's telling them everything
POWELL'S VOICE: How many are there ?
MCCLANE: Figuring there 's at least one to cover the lobby , a couple with the hostagesI 'd say they came in with about a dozenbut they 're down to nine now , including the skydiver you already met . These guys are mostly Europeans , judging y their clothing labels , and they 're well financed and very slick .
POWELL: How do you know ?
MCCLANE: I 've seen enough phoney ID 's in my time to recognize that the ones they 've got cost a fortune . Add all that up and I do n't know what the fuck it means , but these are bad ass preps and they 're here to stay .
POWELL: I hear you Partner . And LA 's finest are on it , so light 'em if you got 'em .

ROBINSON: He claims ? Powell , has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists , pulling your chain ? Or some kind of nut case who
POWELL: I do n't think so , Sir . In fact I think he 's a cop . Maybe not LAPD , but definitely a badge .
ROBINSON: How do you know ?
POWELL: A hunch . Things he said . Like , knowing how to recognize a phony

MCCLANE: Well , from up here , it looks like you 're in charge of shit , Dwayne . I have n't seen such a fucked up operation since the Bride of Frankenstein . Ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass .
ROBINSON: Listen asshole !
MCCLANE: Asshole ? I 'm not the one who just for butt fucked on national TV , Dwayne ! Now if you 're not part of the solution , stop being part of the problem ! Get off the Goddamn radio and put Al back on ! McClane is so furious , he 's out of breath .

Now , personally , I do n't care about your politics . Maybe you 're pissed at the Camel Jockeys , maybe it 's the Hebes , Northern Ireland , that 's none of my business . I figure , You 're here to negotiate , am I right ?
HANS: You 're amazing . You figured this all out already ?
ELLIS: Hey , business is business . You use a gun , I use a fountain pen , what 's the difference ? To put it in my terms , you 're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you did n't expect a poison pill was gon na be running around the building .

MCCLANE: Ellis , what have you told them ?
ELLIS: I told them we 're old friends and you were my guest at the party .

ELLIS: Tell me about it . He looks at Hans , who gives him a nod .
ELLIS' VOICE: John , did n't you hear me ?
MCCLANE: Yeah , I hear you , you fucking moron !
ELLIS: John , I think you could get with the program a little . The police are here now . It 's their problem . Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt . Hey , I 'm putting my life on the line fo you buddy
MCCLANE: Do n't you think I know that ! Put Hans on ! Hans , listen to me , that shithead does n't know what kind of scum you are , but I do
HANS: Good . Then you 'll give us what we want and save your friend 's life . You 're not part of this equation . It 's time to realize that .
ELLIS: What am I , a method actor ? Hans , abe , put away the gun . This is adio , not television
MCCLANE: That asshole 's not my friend ! I barely know him ! I hate his fucking guts Ellis , for Christ 's sake , tell him you do n't mean shit to me
ELLIS: John , how can you say that , afte all these years ? John ? John ?
HANS: Hear that ? Talk to me , where are my detonators . Where are they or shall I shoot another one ? Sooner or later I might get to someone you do care about .
MCCLANE: Go fuck yourself . He DISCONNECTS .
ROBINSON: Goddamn , did n't you hear him ! He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself he gave that man to them
POWELL: Christ , ca n't you read between the lines ! He did everything he could to save himif he gave himself up they 'd both be dead !
ROBINSON: Maybe . And maybe they 'd at least e talking to us ! Now tell you 'partner ' to stay out of it , or so help me if he lives through this I 'll put him behind bars myself !
POWELL: He 's alone , tired , hunted , and has n't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you 're going to do to him ? Robinson , wake up and smell the shit you 're shoveling !
ROBINSON: Anytime you want to go home , Sergeantconsider yourself dismissed . They lock eyes .
POWELL: No Sir . You could n't drag me away .
HANS' VOICE: Attention police . Attention police .
POWELL: This is
ROBINSON: This is Deputy Chief Robinson . Who is this ?
HANS: This is Hans Gruber . I assume you ealize the futility of direct action against me . We have no wish fo further loss of life .
ROBINSON: What do you wish for , Mister Gruber ?
HANS: I have comrades in arms around the world who are languishing in prison . The American State Department enjoys attling its saber to its own ends now it can rattle it for me .
HANS' VOICE: The following people are to be eleased from their captors In Northern Ireland , the seven members of the New Provo Front . In Canada , the five imprisoned leaders of Liberte de Quebec
HANS: in Sri Lanka , the nine members of the Asian Dawn movement

You have two hours to comply .
ROBINSON: Two hours ? Are you insane ? I ca n't authorizehello ? Hello ?

KARL: Franco is checking the explosives , Fritz is with him .
HANS: I 'll check the explosives . You just get those detonators .
MCCLANE: Al ? Al , you there ?
POWELL: I 'm here , cowboy .
MCCLANE: Speaking of cows , did you eve hear so much bullshit in your life ? Two hours ? That does n't even make any sense
POWELL: Do n't tell me , partner . I 'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang .
MCCLANE: The way you drove that car , I figured you for the streets .
POWELL: In my youth , partner . In my youth .
GAIL: author of 'Hostage/Terrorist , Terrorist/Hostage , a Study in Duality . ' Dr. Hasseldorf , what can we expect in the next few hours ?
HASSELDORF: Well , Gail , by this time the hostages and their captors should be entering the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome .
HARVEY: As in Helsinki , Sweden ?
HASSELDORF: UhFinland . Basically , it 's when the hostages and the terrorists go through a sort of psychological transference and projection of dependency
ROBINSON: Thethe FBI ? Here ? Now ?

MCCLANE: Whoa , whoa , easy man . I wo n't hurt you . Who are you ? What are you looking for ? Hans ' eyes dart towards
HANS: A way up to the roofI thought I could signal for help He starts in that direction .
MCCLANE: Forget it . They got a guy up there . You want to stay alive , keep moving . Hey ? You hear me ?
HANS: Youyou 're an American ?
MCCLANE: Only if New Jersey counts .
ROBINSON: We 've got thirty , maybe thirty-five hostages , probably on the 30th floor seven , maybe eight terrorists .
LITTLE JOHNSON: Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario .
BIG JOHNSON: Thank you . We 'll handle it from here . When we need to commandee your men , we 'll try and let you know . He starts to move away with his partner .
POWELL: Are n't you forgetting something ?
BIG JOHNSON: Such as ?
POWELL: John McClane ! He 's the man who gave us all the information we 've got ! He 's the reason you 're facing seven terrorists instead of twelve .
LITTLE JOHNSON: He 's inside ? Who is he ?
ROBINSON: He may be a copwe 're checking on that
BIG JOHNSON: One of yours ?
ROBINSON: No , sir .
BIG JOHNSON: If he 's not a terrorist , and he 's not a hostagehe 's just not part of the equation . They start to walk away .
POWELL: Tthat 's the same Goddamn thing the terrorists said !
LITTLE JOHNSON: Really ? That 's one good thing . Sound like we 're dealing with pros . They leave .
HANS: There was a party celebration all of a sudden they were there shooting threatening us

HANS: William Clay . Call me Bill .
MCCLANE: Bill , you know how to use a handgun ?
HANS: One weekend I went to a combat ranch You know , that game with the , the guns that shoot red paint ? Must sound pretty silly to you
MCCLANE: Sounds better than nothing .
HANS: Karl ! Franco ! I 'm on 33 . Come quickly . Put down your gun and give me my detonators . McClane just looks at him .
MCCLANE: Hans . Your Hans .
HANS: Put it down now .
MCCLANE: That was tricky , with the accent . I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan . Why do you need the detonators , Hans ? I already used the explosives .
HANS: I 'm going to count to three
MCCLANE: Yeah . Like you did with Takagi .
HANS: You were saying . McClane whirls in time to see
HASSELDORF: all depends on what we mean by `` Terror . ' If Clauswitz could say 'War is the last resort of Deplomacy , ' could n't we just as well say that terrorism has an equal claim to
THORNBURG: You got something ?
MARY: Just McClane 's name , badge number , police record , vital statistics And his family 's address right here in L.A. As Thornburg GRINS we GO TO
GINNY: That one look pissed , Ms. Gennero
HOLLY: Thank God . He 's still alive .

POWELL: You do n't want to know .
MCCLANE: Put me down for twenty anywayI 'm good for itso , what got you off the street , Al ? You liked lousy coffee , or what ?

LITTLE JOHNSON: Do itnow .
MCCLANE: Powell ? What 's going on ?
POWELL: Ask the FBI . They 've got the terrorist playbook and they 're running it , step y step . McClane reacts , worried ; he knows better .
KRISTOFF: Damn ! It did n't go !
THEO: They 're on the building circuit it 's too local .
HANS: Encourage them to be bolder .
THEO: The only thing left for them is the City Grid They may not do it .
LITTLE JOHNSON: Shit ! Cut it again . Go wider .
ENGINEER: I ca n't go wider here I 'd have to call downtown have them take down one of the city gridsyou 're talking ten square lock
ROBINSON: ten blocks ? Are you crazy ? It 's Christmas Eve , thousands of people the Mayor 'll scream bloody murder
BIG JOHNSON: We must shut down the building . Go wider !

HANS: I hear you , FBI . We 'll be ready . He disconnects , smiles at Theo .
BIG JOHNSON: By the time he figures out what hit him he 'll be in a body bag .
MCCLANE'S VOICE: Powell , listen Powell moves off to be alone .

MCCLANE: Better this way , is n't it ? I mean , any faggot can shoot a gun .
BIG JOHNSON: Stay low . They 're expecting transports , not gunships .
LITTLE JOHNSON: What do you figure on breakage ?
BIG JOHNSON: I figure we take out all the terrorists , and lose 20 percent of the hostages 25 , tops .
LITTLE JOHNSON: I can live with those numbers .
HANS: A little bonus for us . A policeman 's wife might come in handy . He picks up a CB , speaks into it .
HOLLY: After all your posturing , all you speechesyou 're nothing but a common thief .
HANS: I 'm an exceptional thief , Mrs. McClane . And now that I 'm moving up to kidnapping , you should be more polite . He SLAPS her .

SAM: The Ghost of Christmas Past . Nakatomi ? LA ? You 're John McClane , ight ?
MCCLANE: Depends who you are .
SAM: Sam Coleman , WADC news - Hey , I know how you feel about the media , but we 're not all like that putz Thornberg - he crossed the line . That 's why they canned him out in
MCCLANE: Yeah . Now he 's on the Network interviewing Transsexual Gum Surgeons and laughing all the way to the bank .
SAM: Okay . The guy makes Geraldo look like Walter Chronkite . Does n't mean you ca n't cut me some slack . I saw the stiff . Word is that was you handiwork .
MCCLANE: Nah . I do needlepoint .
LORENZO: -well , the press was here , crawling all over the Esperanza story so they got it right on the fucking news , loodstains and all
TRUDEAU: Could n't be helped , I guess . What was it , gangs ?
MCCLANE'S VOICE: Yeah if your gangs get thei training at Fort Bragg .
TRUDEAU: Who the hell is this ?
MCCLANE: I 'm a police officer , Mr. Trudeau-
LORENZO: L.A. , Mr. Lorenzo-do n't mean shit-
TRUDEAU: That 's what I said about my last cholesterol test . What 's your problem-
READING BADGE: Lieutenant McClane ?
MCCLANE: I think something serious is going to happen here tonight -
TRUDEAU: Hey . Something serious happens every night , only it does n't make the newspapers . Ever see those guys on TV , juggling knives and cha n i saws ? That 's what we 're doing with those planes up there , only we do it one handed 'cause the other hand 's playing 3 card monte with the planes on the ground .
MCCLANE: Anybody try and fix the deck tonight ? Anything weird going on besides the shooting ?
BARNES: We did . lose FAA approach control-
MCCLANE: What 's that ?
TRUDEAU: One way we manage the planes . But we 've got backup - Long look from McClane .
BURKE: We 're hot !
TO GARBER: Light it up .
STUART: 5 minutes to zero hour . Stand by .
MCCLANE: Okay . You clot back-up - back-up for everything you think can go wrong . What about something nobody anticipated ? Not accidents , not
TRUDEAU: The human element.. ?
MCCLANE: Damned straight the human element . You 've got the world 's biggest drug dealer on the way , one body and a'- lot of questionsl Does n't anyone want to look for answers ?
TRUDEAU: Lorenzo . Have all your shift Commanders report in now .
LORENZO: What ? You 're buying into this -
TRUDEAU: I want them to report anything out of the ordinary no matter how trivial . You got that ?
LORENZO: I got it .
BARNES: Oh , my God Everyone turns at the chill in Barne 's voice .
TRUDEAU: What is it ?
MCCLANE: Jesus
TRUDEAU: Go to emegency lighting now !
BARNES: Emergencies ! Controllers , Code Yellow !
TECHNICIAN: Back up systems wo n't come up- !
TRUDEAU: Shunt to another terminal !
TECHNICIAN: This ai n't software , boss -
LORENZO: Maybe we should call the powe company ?
TRUDEAU: We 're on the same Goddamn grid and we 're hot !
COMING OVER: Checked all systems . It ai n't happening .
PANICKED: Approach control backup ! It 's gone !
2ND ENGINEER: Jesus ! Instrument landing system i s c l own !
BARNES: Confirmed ! ILS is dead - every Goddamn system is dead !
TRUDEAU: Jacoby , Strauss . Get your controllers on the horn - every plane approaching our Vortacs that 's not in our pattern yet gets turned away'now . Everyone already inside our patrn holds at the outer marker . Stack 'em , pack 'em , and rack 'em . Move . I want every off duty controller and technician here in five minutes . Page the terminal - no , better , beep them .
TURNING: McClane . This what you were expecting ?
MCCLANE: This ? This ai n't it , pal . This is just the beginning .
HOPEFUL: FAA hotline - !
LORENZO: How could they know already - ?
MCCLANE: Maybe they do n't .
TO TRUDEAU: Maybe it 's them .
TRUDEAU: Put it on speaker .
STUART'S VOICE: Attention , Dulles Tower . Attention , Dulles Tower -
DRYLY: I think by now I 've got you attention . I know your recorders go 24 hours around the clock , so I 'll e quick -you can play me back late all you want .
TRUDEAU: How . did you get on this line ? Who is this ?
STUART: Who I am is unimportant . What I want well , if you do n't want those planes overhead to start dropping like flies when they run out of fuel what I want is very important . All REACT - McClane as much as anyone .
STUART CONT'D: A plane is going to be landing at this Airport in 58 minutes . It is FM 1 - Foreign Military 1 .
MCCLANE: Esperanza ? Trudeau nods -
STUART: This plane is scheduled to be met y a continigent from the U.S. Justice-department . But now there will be a change of plans . This plane will not be met by anyone . It will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested . That will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility fo it . At the same time , I want a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled .
MCCLANE: What 's all that about ?
BARNES: A 747 has the furthest flight capacity of anything we 've got here . Take out the seats and save some weight , add the wing tanks and it could go to Australia , Africa , Asia - hell the whole Goddamn world . '
MCCLANE: Meaning they pull Esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere there 's no extradition treaties .
LORENZO: They 're talking to us on our own Goddamn system ! They got ta be close - I 'll have my men tear this airport
MCCLANE: About time , Carmine . Guess you have to light a fire under your ass to light a fire under your ass .
LORENZO: McClane , I got a first class unit here , SWAT team and all , and we do n't need any Monday morning quarterbacks .
MCCLANE: Monday morning ? My wife 's on one of those planes these aasstards are fucking with ! That makes me a playe on the fucking field , you putz ! And if you got off your fat ass when I told you to , maybe we would n't be knee deep in shit right now !
LORENZO: Security ! You 're out of here !
TO GUARDS: See Mr. McClane out .
MCCLANE: Trudeau , ca n't you see you 're dealing with pros ? You ca n't fuck with these
TO TRUDEAU: Sam Coleman , WNTW news . Mr. Trudeau , there 's a lot of rumors flying around
LORENZO: Oh , no , no way -
TRUDEAU: This is off limits , Coleman , you know that !
MCCLANE: Anything you can think-of , they 'll think of , too !
LORENZO: Lobby Security , come in .
LOBBY COP: , Tomlinson here -
LORENZO: And Lorenzo here , with two unauthorized personnel in the fucking tower ! Get your thumb out of you ass and get over to the elevator . Get them out and post a guard o you 're gon na have a pink slip in you Christmas stocking !
SAM: Anything who can think of ? Ca n't fuck with.what guys ?
MCCLANE: Shit !
SAM: Big drug dealer on the way to prison . Gunfight in airport . Every controlle in the coffee shop getting beeped and hauling ass , and you rocking the oat . A connection ? Come on , McClane -Just a few words - ?
MCCLANE: ( opening the control
PANEL: How about `` fuck '' and `` you '' ?
SAM: I already got that from Colonel Stuart , thanks - ! McClane STOPS as if zapped by a Taser .
REALIZING: Stuart ! The guy who got canned by Congress - that 's who he was-
SAM: Huh ? Who he who ?
BARNES: guys , guys , all we have to do is find a way to transmit -
SARCASTIC: Yeah , right . Somebody run down to Radio Shack and get a transmitter-
BARNES: We have one .
TRUDEAU: Get what you need . Borrow , steal , kill .
LORENZO: I want my Swat team to go with him as cover . Whatever we can think of - they can think of , too .
STUART'S VOICE: Attention , Tower . You have two more minutes to stack the planes in you inbound pattern over your outside adio marker . After that you will e able.to receive only . Any attempt to restore your systems will be met y severe penalties .
LORENZO: He 's bluffing - Lorenzo leaves . Trudeau ai n't so sure .
TO STUART: Damn it , you ca n't do this - !
STUART: I am doing this .
TRUDEAU: Put me on all bands
PAUSE: Severe technical problems here .
TRUDEAU CONT'D: Our NAV and Approach systems are down and we expect to lose voice in another minute . We want you to continue holding at the outer marke as directed and wait for furthe instructions . As - as soon as we 're ack on line we 'll expedite you landings on a.fuel emergency basis . Good luck
PAUSE: God bless . He turns to a tech , face ashen .
TRUDEAU: Okay . Change the boards .
MCCLANE: I do n't believe this anothe fucking elevator another fucking asement why does this always happen to me ?
MARVIN CONT'D: They 're valuble , you know . Me , I like those old 78 's . Wo n't find me switching like everybody else to these new fangled 45 's .
MCCLANE: You 're what , the janitor ?
MARVIN: Damn straight . Janitor , and proud of it . Do n't need any of this new fangled custodial engineer crap . Just do my job and screw the fancy talk . You know , you 're not supposed to be down here .
LOOKING AROUND: Yeah . Just like you 're not supposed to be living here .
MARVIN: W-who said I was living here ? McClane shows his badge .
MCCLANE: Come on , Marvin . I was n't born yesterday . Carmine Lorenzo know you do n't go home after you punch out ?
MARVIN: L-Lorenzo ? C-come on , officer , I can barely get by , even with my pension . You know , I 'm a vet , WW 2 ? If it was n't for guys like me , you kids ' be eatin ' sushi today . I 'm just trying to . save a few . bucks -I could . get fired if you tell .
MCCLANE: I 'm a veteran myself , Marvin . And a married one . You married ?
MARVIN: Six times .
MCCLANE: My wife may be in some trouble upstairs . I got ta find out . This set up of yours ? I wo n't tell a soul provided you patch me into this panel , 'let me eavesdrop on the tower . What do you say ?
MARVIN: You a cop or a lawyer ?
LORENZO'S VOICE: Through the annex skywalk to the new terminal that way nobody sees them , we do n't have any panic .
TRUDEAU'S VOICE: And we do n't want any disasters . Barnes has five minutes to check out that antenna array .
MCCLANE: Christ . They 're gon na try something cute where 's this annex skywalk ?
MARVIN: Annex skywalk ? Sounds like the pissant World 's Fair
MARVIN CONT'D: Lem me see yeah , must be this connects to the new terminal -
MCCLANE: Shit , it 's a fucking bottleneck . Anybody smart enough to shut down the airport is smart enough to figure this it 's a perfect place for an ambush
MARVIN: Now , see ? Here 's you . And here 's the skywalk .
MCCLANE: Tunnels .
NODDING: Like the Japs had all over Iwo Jima . That 's where I got wounded . But we put those little twerps in their place once and for all . These are air ducts for all the terminals . Heating , cooling . Whole shebang .
MCCLANE: Looks like maybe a mile . Easy jog .
AMUSED: Uh-uh . It 's a pisser of a crawl . And that 's the easy part ; firs you got ta be an acrobat .
MCCLANE: Whoa .
MARVIN: Winter up there Summer down here .
MCCLANE CONT'D: I owe you one , Marvin . How about a sixpack of malt liquor ?
MARVIN: How 'bout a case of Johnny Walker ? Hey , I may be homeless , but I ai n't tasteless .
BARNES: We 're in the annex skywalk . I can see the dish ! I 'll call you as soon as it 's hot for a protocol test .
AIRPORT COP: Hey ! Put that back on ! No reaction . The cop runs forward .
FL: SWAT COP HEY ! ASSHOLE ! What do I look like to you ?
MCCLANE: Oh , fuck
MCCLANE: You okay ? .
SHAKILY: The antenna array - 'Both look , at it - and then
SLOWLY STANDING: Bait . Something to jerk you off , make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men , and make you waste time .
LOOKING SKYWARD: Time they do n't have .
DRYLY: I think you 're closer than fifty yards .
THORNBERG: So is that plane practically . Despite herself , she looks out .
HOLLY: Yeah . There 's quite a few out there ; we 're in a regular traffic jam .
THORNBERG: There 's nothing regular about it .
TURNING: I see you 're intrigued . That 's my gift , Mrs. McClane . I make people curious .
HOLLY: Do n't you mean nauseous ?
THORNBERG: The people have a right to know , Mrs. McClane . You got in the way of that .
HOLLY: You endangered my children my husband.. and me .
BARNES: me ? I 'll live . But Lorenzo 's SWAT team is dead and the antenna array is toast . Start looking for a new miracle .
GARBER: I say again , Annex team report in . Annex team , report in . He looks at Stuart , concerned .
MCCLANE: What ?
BARNES: Some kind of scrambler so even if we scan their frequency we ca n't listen in . Descramble mode must activate on this code panel .
ALMOST ADMIRINGLY: These guys are pros .
MCCLANE: So are you . Break the code -
BARNES: Eight numbers - that 's 8 X 7 X 6 times
THINKING: 40,320 possible combinations .
WEAKLY: Next time you kill one of these guys - get them to enter the code first .
TO STUART: Sir , we just monitored a call from their chief engineer . Our people took out their Swat team completely .
GARBER: You were right they went for the antenna array . We 're right on schedule .
STUART: Except losing our own team was n't part of the plan .
STUART'S VOICE: You 've wasted lives and time on a futile and obvious target . Now you have to pay the penalty .
MCCLANE: There 's five dead officers here , Colonel Stuart - Is n't that penalty enough ?
LORENZO: McClane ! Keep out of this ! You-
STUART: McClave ? John McClane ? The policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi hostages ? I read about you in People magazine . You seemed out of you league on Nightline , though
MCCLANE: Yeah , Colonel . We were both famous for five minutes . Saw you get shit canned by Congress on TV . How much drug money is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor ?
STUART: I think Cardinal Richlieu said it est Treason is merely a matte of dates . And this country has to learn it ca n't keep cutting the legs off men . like General Esperanza -men with the guts to stand up to Soviet agression .
MCCLANE: And lesson one starts with killing policemen ? What 's lesson two - the Neutron bomb ?
STUART: I think we can find something in etween . Give me a flight number - one low on fuel .
BRITISH PILOT: Approach , this is one-fourteen . Where the devil have you been ?
STUART'S VOICE: We been right here , old man . But our systems did n't come back on line until just this second .
BRITISH PILOT: BARNES Roger , Approach , and about time I 've got 230 people
TRUDEAU: That 's the runway between here and the new terminal he wants to make all of.us watch it .
BARNES: Do n't do it you bastards , do n't do it.. !
RIPPING FABRIC: Whatever the fuck I can , Barnes whatever the fuck I can .
PILOT: Ladies and Gentlemen , as you 've probably noticed , we 've started ou descent .
PILOT'S VOICE: We 're sorry about the inconvenience , ut we 'll all be on the ground in a few minutes .
STEWARDESS: Just like British rail , luv . May e.late but we get you there .
STUART: Activate ILS landing system . But Recalibrate sea level . Minus 200 feet .
TRUDEAU: Oh , Godno
A TECHNICIAN: Ca n't we cut in , jam them -
TRUDEAU: Everything 's dead .
TRUDEAU: Christ . It 's McClane . He 'll get himself killed -
BARNES: Come on , see the torch , see the
PILOT'S VOICE: Dulles , this is Windsor one fourteen . Inside the outer marker .
STUART'S VOICE: ( doing a different voice
THAN BEFORE: Roger , Windsor . This is Dulles Tower . We have radar contact and show you on ILS . You are in the glide path and looking good .
PILOT'S VOICE: Wait a minute something down there through the snow looked like a light
STUART: Probably our runway systems coming ack up . Do n't worry about it you 're coming in on instruments .
PILOT: Roger . Flaps down . Airspeed 100 knots 80 70
NAVIGATOR: RVR 1/4 mile . altitude 1000 feet 800 Ref plus 20
MCCLANE: No no , Jesus , Mary , Mother of God , no pull up pull up
NAVIGATOR: 600 feet
STUART: Looking good , Windsor watch it - there 's a 30 knot cross wind and the runway 's icy - atta boy -atta
NAVIGATOR: Four hundred feet - two hund-
RESCUE WORKER: Tower , this is Rescue Three . No survivors . Repeat , no surviv-
MCCLANE: Relax , pal , I 'm not a survivor . I 'm just another victim . He grabs the rescue worker by the collar .
MCCLANE CONT'D: .the last fucking victim he 'll ever have .
ESPERANZA: Dios , los calambres ! Muchacho , si possible a removar eses ? De donde a yo caminar , si ? The young guard shakes his head .
ESPERANZA: Bueno , joven , bueno ! Tu eres un soldado excelente ! Ahora , en vez del libertad - dame un fosforo ? Flattered , the kid lights him up .
GARBER: Sir . They 've done everything we 've anticpated so far-
STUART: Do n't worry , Captain . If this goes into extra innings
A SHRU: Well , we 'll just call an our man in the other team 's locker room .
SAM: hundreds of people in the terminal heard or saw the crash , but still there has been no official word from authorities . Meanwhile - despite the fact that only one runway has een closed due to the tragedy , several dozen airliners are visible from where I stand , endlessly circling the field . Rumors abound that somehow the accident has interfered with normal landing procedures here .
TRUDEAU: Barnes . We have to warn those planes we got a lunatic down here who likes to pretend he 's the tower . Get up to the cab and get us on the air .
BARNES: On the air ? With what ?
TRUDEAU: With your Goddamn brain !
MCCLANE: Trudeau I I
TRUDEAU: You do n't have to say anything , McClane . We all know how you feel .
MCCLANE: Do you ? Do you ? I 've been a cop 13 years Everything from lost kids to hostages but all of it was taking care of business taking care of peoplle until tonight . Tonight , everything I did , everything I tried
VOICE TIGHT: I never felt so useless .
TRUDEAU: Our own SWAT team 's gone . We called the Government for help . They 're sending in a special Army unit . Tactical Terrorist Team
MCCLANE: And ?
TRUDEAU: Your wife 's plane ? They keep broadcasting , even though we ca n't answer . They they 'll un out of fuel in 90 minutes . CAMERA PUSHES IN on McClane .
HOLLY: Listen , Dick -
"INNOCENTLY": That is your name ? Dick , if you 're going-Eo keep getting this close , you think you could change aftershaves ?
DRYLY: Anything else ?
HOLLY: A stronger mouthwash would be nice . He glares at her , moves down the aisle .
THORNBERG: Victor . Victor !
VICTOR: Uh - yeah , what ?
THORNBERG: Did you pack the radio mikes from the shoot , or put them in your carry on ?
VICTOR: Are you crazy ? I would n't let those assholes check 'em -
THORNBERG: I love you . Get one of the eceivers .
4 THORNBERG: Can you tune in the cockpit frequency ? I want to hear what 's going on .
VICTOR: 4 Should be on our band
PUZZLED: Nothing .
THORNBERG: You just said it would work -
VICTOR: It is working . But all I get is
LISTENING AGAIN: The weather recording . It 's like like the tower is n't there .
THORNBERG: Stay on it . Tell me if anything changes .

UNIMPRESSED: This is it ? A dozen men ? Pause . Grant stops , looks at him .
GRANT: One crisis one dozen . Who are you ?
MCCLANE: John McClane .
GRANT: McClane Oh , yeah , you 're the one who tried to save that plane tonight .
STEPPING CLOSER: You showed some balls out there , McClane . Now show some sense and let the pros handle things .
MCCLANE: Unfortunately the pros are on the other side . Colonel Stuart is one of your boys -
TIGHTLY: Not any more , he 's not . Gentlemen , we are here to take down Colonel Stuart and we will take him down . You see , I served , with him . And I taught him everything he knows .
QUIETLY: Yeah . But what if he took some night courses ?
GRANT: cto his men ) All right , hustle ! Command post will e in the Airport Police office . I want to be tied into the Tower and every sysytem that 's still working in fifteen minutes !
SERGEANT: You heard the man , troop ! Move it !
MCCLANE: Trudeau . Did things just get better o worse ?
2ND ENGINEER: Lights ! Big portable lights ! We set up on the field and -
BARNES: And wait for those lunatics to shoot them out ? And where do we get those `` big portable lights '' ? Borrow them from Batman ?
1ST ENGINEER: Semaphore ! That gets my vote-
BARNES: Your vote ? You voted for Dukakis ! ( exasperated , to anothe
MAN: What about the airphone idea ?
3RD ENGINEER: Eighteen planes up there ; only five have those phones . We got through to three of them , still trying with the others .
BARNES: Great , that leaves thirteen accidents waiting to happen . Are they still ucking headwinds ? That 's eating up most of their fuel .
1ST ENGINEER: Just checked the weather . Headwinds slamming right into everybody ove the outer marker . The planes with enough fuel were already shunted to
BARNES: Damn ! The Outer Marker ! ( on t eir loo s It 's a beacon , right ? A radio beacon , that sends out this `` boop-boop-boop '' so they know they 're over it , right ?
1ST ENGINEER: So ?
BARNES: So , who says that radio signal has to be just `` boop-boop boop '' ?
GETTING IT: We switch the tower freqency ove to the one for the beacon -
BARNES: -and we can talk to the planes and those bas ar s w o did this will neve know !
2ND SERGEANT: Traced the signal , found it in the luggage area . they 've been tapped into the tower all night .
MCCLANE: That 's all we keep hearing . Can you do anything with it ?
CORPORAL TELFORD: If I had a few hours
MCCLANE: My wife has less than two .
SYMPATHETIC: I only got transferred in yesterday egular comm man got appendicitis . But word is nobody 's better at this than Major Grant .
MCCLANE: Except Colonel Stuart ?
GRANT: Trudeau . Lorenzo . You brief me on that plane he asked for , I 'll fill you in on my orders . In my office . Now .
2ND OFFICER: What the fuck -
PILOT: What is it ?
2ND OFFICER: The outer marker beeper ? It 's not eeping . It 's talking . And saying this he turns up a DIAL -
FROM SPEAKER: tention , all aircraft in Dulles landing pattern . Attention . This is Chief Engineer Leslie Barnes . d I have been authorized to brief you in full . At this time this is the only channel available to us . Here is the situation . Approximately 2 hours ago -

THORNBERG: Holy shit - we - we got ta get this on tape -
BARNES' VOICE: We believe this channel is secure ut your own transmissions are not . Do not repeat do not attempt to reply on your own frequencies to this oadcast . These people have already caused one crash by impersonating
THORNBERG: Jesus !
BARNES CONT'D: -repeat , do not accept any instructions claiming to be from ou tower unless you hear your own flight ecorder access code . We will get this from your respective airlines and use it for confirmation .
TINNY: Repeat the terrorists have cut off the two systems that can allow you to land The field lights for a manual landing and the ILS for an instrument one . A special US Army unit is already here and preparing to take out the terrorists . CAMERA TIGHTENS on Thornberg Orgasm .
MARVIN: Hey , officer . Thought you 'd be upstairs by now , hanging out with the top brass .
MCCLANE: They kind of busted me down to buck private .
MARVIN: I know that feeling . Interested in a nice coat ?
RECOGNIZING IT: The lining 's ripped and it needs some invisible mending . Keep it . Think you can get me on line upstairs again ?
MARVIN: I was just a kid , working those adios on the B-29 's . But I kept up . Still read Popular Mechanics . These transistor things , I 'm on top of 'em -
STUART: We 've pussied out around the world , over and over again . We drop the Shah , fuck Marcos , throw Noriega overboard . You know what they think around the globe ? The worst thing that can happen to you is to have America as a friend . And now that stain head Gorbachov , he 's got some nice English suits , and a wife without gold teeth , so now the Commies are nice ? Gentlemen , we are soldiers and we do not believe in fairy tales sweet though they may seem . Well , tonight , the pattern ends . The dominos will fall no more and the amparts will remain upri-
STUART: Attention , Dulles Tower

MCCLANE: How about I let you live ?
MARVIN: . Man knows how to bargain
ESPERANZA: Capitain , please tell the tower you will proceed as ordered .

HEARING THIS: Eleven West ? What the fuck happened to fifteen ? ; up to my ass in fucking terrorists again . I got ta start reading my Goddamn horoscope
MCCLANE'S VOICE: Eleven W4 , W5 - Bingo .
ESPERANZA'S VOICE: Eagle Nest , do you copy ? I 'm coming down , now .
STUART'S VOICE: We copy , Falcon . We 'll have you in five minutes .
TO HIMSELF: Not if I can help it , asshole . He turns and begins running down the tunnel .
RADIO VOICE: Isee your lights . Wheels down . 5 seconds ETA . McClane checks his pistol clip with a snap .
MCCLANE: Come to poppa , you son-of-a-bitch-
ESPERANZA: Freedom .
MCCLANE'S VOICE: Not yet .
MCCLANE: Thought you 'd pull this off , did n't you ? I guess you did n't count on me being here . Actually , I did n't count on me being here .
ESPERANZA: W-who are you ?
MCCLANE: Just a cop who 's spent half his caree usting scumbag lowlife dope dealers . Looks like it 's business as usual . Think this will look good on my ecord ?
ESPERANZA: No .
STUART: General !
ESPERANZA: I 'm all right - he said he was a , policeman
AMAZED: A policeman - PUSH to Stuart . He knows which policeman
GARBER: He went in the cockpit -
STUART: He 's going to hell .
SHOUTING: McClane ! I assume it 's you , McClane .

MUFFLED: Where 's - the fucking - door ?
STEWARDESS: They 're getting pretty squirrely back there in fact , so am I .
PILOT: We 're right over Washington see if you can get any TV . That 'll settle 'em down .
STEWARDESS: Works for me . I 'll - She STOPS . She 's SEEN
THORNBERG: Boy , am I good
HOLLY: Writing your acceptance speech fo the video sleaze awards ?
THORNBERG: Try Pulitzer , Mrs. McClane .
STEWARDESS: Sir , please - we may be landing at any moment -the seat belt light is-
THORNBERG: I- I 'm going to be sick -
LISTENING: I know he 's getting ready for the oadcast , that 's why I want him ! Now get him or start typing you esume !
MCCLANE: Esperanza 's down but he 's hurt . I killed one more man that 's six they 've lost all together .
UNIMPRESSED: Maybe if we knew how many they had to start with , we could get excited . But if they got fifty guys , it 's a little early to break out the champagne .
GRANT: McClane , we do n't need a loose cannon on this deck . What if they decide to crash another plane in retaliation for your little stunt ?
INDICATING BARNES: Last I heard , they ca n't do that again . And if I grabbed Esperanza , the situation would be over .
GRANT: Maybe they 're more creative than you
MCCLANE: .The story of my life .
BARNES: McClane . You said they showed up there right away ?
MCCLANE: Stuart 's guys ? Yeah . That means they 're on the field or close -
BARNES: I think I know where .
MCCLANE: So - if they know this too - they could be sitting around the fireplace and hanging their fucking stockings in one of these houses ?
BARNES: Maybe . Yeah . Well , seventy eighty per cent , five percent either way-
MCCLANE: Are you sure or not ?
BARNES: I was sure about tying into the antenna array . And and I got five officers killed .
MCCLANE: You did n't do that - you did you
BARNES: I had a choice and I made it . But those cops did n't have a choice , and neither do those soldiers now . I 'm an engineer , McClane . It 's supposed to a wires and circuits iron and steel . Not flesh and blood . Not lives . Ifif I 'm wrong again I do n't want anyone else to get orders that could get them killed .
MCCLANE: Then how would you feel about a volunteer ?
OLDER WOMAN: Somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess , that 's for sure .
HOLLY: It 's hard to blame anyone for the
OLDER WOMAN: Yeah ? What about that porker Willard Scott ?
TO HERSELF: I shoulda taken the bus . At least they can pull over for food and gas .
HOLLY: I was just wondering . Our flight was only supposed to.be 5 1/2 hours-
ALMOST SHEEPISH: Do we have enough fuel for all this endless circling ?
STEWARDESS: Oh , of course we do . They anticipate little proems like this .
MCCLANE: Hell . These people are hanging thei Goddamn stockings .
MCCLANE: - and these people are n't .
BARNES: Four more possibles . Three houses and a church .
MCCLANE: Could be a sentry -
BARNES: And he could just be out for a walk-
MCCLANE: Then why is he going over his own footprints ?
WHISPER: Stay here . Get ready to call the marines .
WHISPER: I thought they were Army .
WHISPER: Who the fuck cares , just be ready .
LORENZO: You 're where - you crazy idiot , why ' did n't you -
BARNES: Just get here , .this is it , move you fat ass will ya - ?
GRANT: Gentlemen . We have a situation here
LORENZO: McClane , what the hell do you think you 're doing , playing John Wayne ? How 'd you like to spend the rest of the night in a cell -
PAUSE: shut the fuck up and do something useful . Seal off the street .
LORENZO: You ca n't talk to me like that -

TRUDEAU: Quite clear .
STUART: Good . Please have a ground crew there to confirm the plane 's condition .
STUART: Major Grant , .is n't it ?
GRANT: If you remember me , Colonel , you 'll emember I know the drill as well as you do . Check out your own fucking plane .
DISCONNECTING: We move out in five minutes . Body armor for everyone - full metal jackets . We will take them in the hanger or we will shoot that fucking plane out of the sky . Lorenzo , take your men back to the airport and seal off every exit in case anyone tries to break out on the ground .
MOVING: .You got it .
PRODUCER: Dick , this is nuts - first , you do Siamese Twin drag queens , not hard news ; and second , every station in I town has people out at the airport and none of them has heard even a whisper of this shit you 're running
THORNBERG: Well , none of them is me . You want proof ? Try this -
THORNBERG: I want you to go live , now . Key me in from the files , a publicity shot , whatever , Connie 's got one . And a map , steal one from weather-
PRODUCER: We 're on it , we 're on it -
GIVING ORDERS: We 're cutting in in five minutes ! Tell the affiliates if they want in they got three minutes to shout !

FILTERED: Tom. , I 'm one of the thousand people who has been circling our Nation 's capitol , under the assumption that whatever problem was going on fa elow me was a normal one . But the truth is far from normal - the truth is terrifying .
LORENZO: McClane ! Are you out of your fucking mind- ?
MARVIN: This man 's been through serious shit ,
LORENZO: Who the fuck are you ?
MARVIN: ( pointing to his
NAMETAQ: Marvin , the janitor . Do n't need that . custodial enginner crap -
GRABBING LORENZO: Grant - the Terrorist Team -where are they ?
LORENZO: They left to shoot those bastards out of the sky -
MCCLANE: They 're not gon na do that -they 're gon na get on the same Goddamn plane and leave with him ! Before the Army canned him , Stuart must have loaded that unit with his own guys -
LORENZO: But - that firefight at the house-
MCCLANE: A side show to jerk us off - buy them
LORENZO: You 're completely around the fucking end , McClane . And you know what else ? You 're under arrest -
LORENZO: Wha - how -
MCCLANE: These are the bullets they used out there tonight .
LORENZO: Holy shit -
THORNBERG'S VOICE: Since then this reporter has learned that the terrorists have virtual control of the entire airport - a fact the authorities have suppressed . The terrorists promise more bloodshed unless their demands are met ; and now that special Army Commandoes have arrived at the airport , the liklihood of a full scale and deadly battle is dangerously close -
TRUDEAU: Christ - that fucking asshole -
SHOUTING: Converge on Hanger 11 on all fou sides ! When the city blues get here with their backup , they can pick up the pieces ! MOVE OUT ! McClane , you meet my nephew ?

BILLY: You know what I realized just yesterday ? I 've been intimidated y you . I always liked you because you were strong , independent , and all . But I 've been intimidated y that as well . I 've always held -.back with you.- When we kissed , I held back . The same when we made Luve in New York . I keep thinking I have to be special , like normal passion was n't proper as if it were just too ordinary and we were eyond that .
BARBARA: If that 's the case , think that 's a hard thing to
CORRECT;: She kisses him , they hold each other tightly ,
CONTINUING: We 've got plenty of time to find out about one another . Plenty of time .

DEBBIE: Um , that 's a lovely ring .
LORETTA: Oh , thank you . I thought it might e a little gaudywho should I make this out to ?
DEBBIE: Johnson for Congress . It 's not gaudy , it 's justnice and big .
LORETTA: That 's my CarlosI ca n't even look in a store window . We 're walking down this street in Rio , we pass a jewelry storeI did n't even turn my head and he 's in the shop $ 250,000 . I said it 's crazy ut you know Carlos .
DEBBIE: I wish I did .
MRS. BRIDGES: I hear they had him open for six hours .
ZEKE: The sum ' bitch looks terrific .
TOMMY: Absolutely my friend ! How can I pleasure you ?
ZEKE: Bourbon straight up and a Perrie ocks for the lady .
TOMMY: Ah ! Fire and ice ! Wonderful ! But may I suggest you make that a double sir ? After all , so many guests , so few of me who knows when I may be back ?

DEBBIE: It 's just over there .
JOHNSON: So how the heck are you , Olaf ?
ANDERSEN: I should be asking how you are , congressman . Johnson pats his chest and smiles at Vera .
JOHNSON: This old ticker never felt better .
ANDERSEN: It 's good to see you back on you feet , Jeff . We need you in Washington .
VERA JOHNSON: How 's that granddaughter of yours , Olaf ? Ready for the Olympics ?

ZEKE: Bourbon straight up and a Perrie ocks .
TOMMY: Hunh .
ZEKE: Do n't get me wrong , Jeff . Pyramid Insurance does n't want special breaks . I just think we ought to be able to set our own rates without Uncle Sam sticking his nose in our business . Johnson signals Jennifer to come over .
JOHNSON: Do you know my AA ? Zeke Bridges , this is Jennifer , my Administrative Assistant . Zeke 's been a tremendous help to us . I 'd like you to listen to his view on health insurance .

LORETTA: It 's a diamond ring ! A big diamond ing ! Oh my Christ ! She 's frantic . Debbie takes Bruno aside .
DEBBIE: I saw it . It 's huge it must be like eight carats . She says it was a quarter of a million dollars !
BRUNO: Ma'am calm down . Now , is the ing insured ?
LORETTA: Of course it 's insured ! But you know how it works if I report it , they 'll cancel me . And I do n't want another ring ! I need this ing ! The ring Carlos gave me .
BRUNO: Where the fuck is housekeeping ? I called for those dickheads ninety seconds ago .
ANDERSEN: Now I wo n't run through Jeff 's ecord he 's been in Congress twenty years , and I 've only got two minutes . I 'll just say this When those of us in pharmaceuticals , o agribusiness , or insurance , o utilities , or you name it when we 've needed him , Jeff 's been there for us . And we 've been there fo Jeff , too we raised a hundred thousand dollars today !
APPLAUSE: Without further ado , our man in Washington , Jefferson Davis Johnson .
DEBBIE: I should be in there . Good luck , Ms. Preston . I hope you find it .
LORETTA: I ca n't go in there like this . God ! Please listen I 'll pay a ten thousand dollar reward for anybody who finds my ring . Just do n't tell Carlos ! He 'll kill me .
QUESTIONER: What do you make of all this campaign eform business , Jeff ?
JOHNSON: Well , y'know Ernie these days , everyone 's down on the political action committees and so-called special interests . But , heck , I think you and Fran have a right to participate in our democracy in exactly the way you 're doing today . I 'm in Congress to represent you . I do n't want any so-called reform to take that power away from you .
BRUNO: I want every heating grate opened and inspected . I want every ai conditioning duct vacuumed . Do you understand what I 'm saying ?
TOMMY: No ! Please ! Do not report me ! I will be deported !

TOMMY: I remember you were the sloe gin fizz and the mango daquiri ? With perhaps a small umbrella for the lady ?
ZEKE: Bourbon neat and a Perrier , dammit !
TOMMY: And would you still be wanting the umbrella then ?
JOHNSON: Olaf , there 's something I wanted to sound you out on . As a special friend .
ANDERSEN: Shoot .
JOHNSON: I 'm thinking of retiring from Congress . Andersen 's eyes widen in astonishment .
ANDERSEN: You 're what ?
JOHNSON: I 'm thinking maybe I wo n't run . Maybe I should listen more to this . Really appreciate these years . Sail around the world . Climb mountains . Enjoy the fine things of life .
ANDERSEN: Jeff . Listen to me . You ca n't etire . Florida needs you . I need you . I need you on rates . I need you on regulations . I need you on those environmental nutcases
JOHNSON: Olaf , if I retire this year , I get to keep all the money left over in my campaign treasury . Comes to a very tidy nest-egg .
ANDERSEN: How tidy ?
JOHNSON: One-point-three million . It 's called the grandfather loophole .
ANDERSEN: Come on , Jeff . Look at what you 'd be giving up . Going to the best resorts in the world and calling it `` official usiness . '' Golfing and skiing and fishing , and never picking up a tab . And , Jeff there 's no aphrodisiac like power . You can have some of the most intelligent , attractive women in the country . You 've got it made !
JOHNSON: Oh , I suppose that one-point-three may seem like spare change to the head of Gulf Coast Power , but to a country boy like me
ANDERSEN: Okay , Jeff . I get it . Look . There 's a little software company that 's about to go through the roof .
JOHNSON: Well , if you put it like that I now see I have a duty to continue my career in public service . Johnson stands , puts his arm on Andersen . Tommy emerges , shakes his head , and laughs .
TOMMY: I 'm in the wrong business .
LORETTA: You took your time .
ARMANDO: Cops bust you , Tommy ?
TOMMY: Busted ? Moi ? Fuck no .
JENNIFER: Oh my god !
DODGE: It was my honor to serve in Congress with Jeff Johnson for a generation . No one could have been a better legislator . No one could have been a finer husband and father . And now
DODGE: Vera , I know you 're still in shock from Jeff 's passing . But we have to talk about his seat .
JENNIFER: Mrs. Johnson , if you 'd like to discuss this in private
VERA: You can stay what 's the difference ?
DODGE: Vera , I 'd like you to announce that you 're going to run for Congress . Let a few days pass to show prope espect . But next week , I want to stand next to you at a press conference where you declare fo Jeff 's seat in the House .
VERA JOHNSON: No , Dick no .
DODGE: There 's nothing to be afraid of , Vera . With your name , you ca n't lose . People around these parts are so used to voting for Jeff Johnson why , Mrs. Jeff Johnson would win in a walk .
VERA JOHNSON: Dick , I was a Washington wife fo twenty years . Twenty years of Potomac bullshit is plenty for one lifetime .
DODGE: Vera , we 're talking about becoming a Member of Congress . We 're talking about a sure thing .
JENNIFER: Do n't worry about running the office I 'll be there night and day .
VERA JOHNSON: I 'm sure you would , dear . But I could n't give you the same jo satisfaction Jeff gave you .
GRANDMA: This is very sweet of you , darling . But you should n't have done it . Where did you get the money ?
TOMMY: You do n't want to know .
GRANDMA: How did I end up with a thief for a grandson ?
TOMMY: Grandma I told you . I 'm not a thief . I 'm a con man . An artist .
GRANDMA: But also a crook .
TOMMY: But I only con crooks , Grandma . You ca n't con an honest man . Only somebody who wants something fo nothing . But the good Lord must have been fond of pigeons , because he made so many of them .
GRANDMA: Sometimes I just wish you were more like your Daddy
TOMMY: You mean , dead ?
GRANDMA: No , smartmouth I mean someone who made something of himself .
LORETTA: LOOKit 's the ad !
GRANDMA: Compared to what ? Loretta , why do n't you go baste the turkey ?
TOMMY: See ? I told you TV advertising works .
TOMMY: Bingo ! Lorettaguy wants to speak to Inga .
LORETTA: Tell him to call back . I 'm asting .
TOMMY: Ja , this is Inga . Hello Paul how are you tonight ? You are feeling naughty ? That 's all right you have your what in a bowl of oatmeal ? Yes , that is very naughty , and maybe a little sick .
GRANDMA: Disgusting .
TOMMY: Oh NO ! It 's my husband Lars . He 's home early , I must go before you want to talk to Lars too ? So you like to talk dirty out of oth sides of your mouth . Man , you are one twisted bastard ! Laughing , he hangs up .
GRANDMA: Tommy , please !
TOMMY: Sorry , grandma , just getting a third minute out of him .
LORETTA: You hung up on Paul ? He 's one of my best customers .
GRANDMA: I ca n't believe any relative of mine does that for a living .
LORETTA: C'mon Grammait 's only my voice . They never actually meet me .
GRANDMA: So my granddaughter talks dirty for a living and my grandson 's a thief .
TOMMY: What 's up , Grandma ? Are you embarrassed to show my picture around the pool ?
GRANDMA: Of course I 'm not . Look .
GRANDMA: Make me proud of you , Tommy . Make me proud of the name you carry .
GENERAL MANAGER: I 'm Ned Grable , vice president and general manager of WFLA . We think Mrs. Jeff Johnson did the right thing in not running for the congressional seat left vacant by her husband 's death . The editorial catches Grandma 's attention .
GRANDMA: Name recognition . Lordy , what a notion . People have to be some oobs just to vote for someone ecause their name is Johnson . Tommy 's eyes widen .
TOMMY: What did you say , Grandma ?
ARMANDO: What 's this about , jefe ?
TOMMY: Loretta ! Get off the damn phone !
ARMANDO: This better be good .
TOMMY: `` This better be good . '' Loretta !
LORETTA: Oh , ya , ya , God , you 're so big ! Uh-oh , I have to go now , my husband Sven is home early
TOMMY: Goddammit , Inga , is it that pervert again ! Damn ! He smacks the receiver with his hand .
LORETTA: Okay , Tommy , what 's so damn important ?
HOMER: Yeah , I got work to do .
TOMMY: My friends , I want to tell you about a town where the streets are paved with gold . This is a town where the marks give you money efore you ask . A town where they take you to dinner after you fuck 'em . A town where when they need money , they just print more . This is a town where a guy bounced nine hundred checks and he did n't even have to skip town ! ! !
ARMANDO: Ai n't no town like that .
LORETTA: You mean Vegas ?
TOMMY: No . Washington , D.C . I 'm going to run for Congress .
LORETTA: What is this , a joke ?
HOMER: I do n't get it .
ARMANDO: What 's the con , Tommy ?
TOMMY: Van Dyke . You remember Willie Sutton ?
VAN DYKE: Of blessed memory .
TOMMY: You remember what he said ? They asked him , Why do you rob banks ? And he said , That 's where the money is . I tell you , people Washington . That 's where the money is .
TOMMY: I found this shit in the library . You know how much a congressman makes ? A hundred and thirty a yea and that 's just base pay fo getting your ass elected . Then there are these things called PACs , and these lobbyists , whose whole point in life is to buy you off . It 's the con of a lifetime and the damn thing is , it 's legal ! This is hot , people , we can do this !
ARMANDO: Who `` we , '' white man ?
TOMMY: You never heard of staff , Armando ? I get in , I get a staff allowance of five hundred and thirty-seven grand a year Loretta wolf-WHISTLES .
LORETTA: And how exactly were you going to get your butt to Congress ?
HOMER: Yeah why would anyone vote fo you ?
TOMMY: Not for me , Homer . For Jeff Johnson . Name recognition that 's what it 's all about . You think folks know their congressman died ? I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson , I guarantee they 'll vote for me . Now all 's I have to do is get on the allot .
LORETTA: Which is how ?
TOMMY: Which is where you folks come in . All 's we have to do is collect five thousand six hundred twenty five signatures .
ARMANDO: You shittin ' us ?
HOMER: In your dreams , Tommy .
TOMMY: You people got a better idea ?
VAN DYKE: I do .
TOMMY: Okay gim me the four-one-one on these Silver Foxes Again . It 's a unch of old folks who like to vote ?
VAN DYKE: Do n't laugh , they get an enormous turnout . But the big thing is , they have their own line on the allot . They already got the signatures .
TOMMY: Ah .
VAN DYKE: The lady we 're meeting , Hattie Rifkin , they call her the condo queen .
TOMMY: So all I have to do is snow one old lady . Do n't sound like majo surgery .
HATTIE: So , what brings you here ? You want to talk politics talk !
VAN DYKE: We were wondering who you were going to run for Congress this year .
HATTIE: Oh , the usual sacrifical lamb . Probably Sylvia Roland . She just lost her husband , she needs to meet new people . Why ?
TOMMY: Mrs. Rifkin I want to run .
HATTIE: Well , I want to run too but with this plastic hip , it 's not gon na happen .
TOMMY: What I mean is I 'd like to run for Congress on the Silver Fox ticket . I care about you and you issues .
HATTIE: Yeah , that 's what my son says . But does he call ? Anyway , what makes you think a group of alter cockers are gon na support a man who has n't clipped his first nose hair yet ?
TOMMY: Because I can win .
HATTIE: No , no a Democrat can win . A Republican can win . A Silver Fox can only make a symbolic point .
TOMMY: Mrs. RIfkin , if you give me a ballot line , and if I can get support from
HATTIE: If if . Ven die bubbah halla tsehen qulishkes , het gehaya zadeh .
TOMMY: Sure , but besser die viller ein der kenner .
HATTIE: Where the Hell did you learn to speak Yiddish ?
TOMMY: The same place I learned to hustle shtarkers at gin rummy . From Morris Elfbein the Gin King of Miami Beach .
HATTIE: No kidding you knew the Rudolf Valentino of Dade County ?
TOMMY: He taught me a great deal . He taught me you do n't always need the est cards to win .
HATTIE: Maybe not in gin , but in politics , young man , you need money to win , you need a name to win , you
TOMMY: Oh , I have a name .
HATTIE: What , you 're an athlete , a movie star ? I do n't get out as much as I used to . You 're not on MTV , are you ?
TOMMY: No ma'am . My name is Johnson . Jeff Johnson . The Name You Know .
HATTIE: Jeff Johnson . Well , that 's a name even our Alzheimer 's Group will emember . Still , for a full-up campaign , we 'd need materials , we 'd need ads
TOMMY: You leave that to me , Mrs. R .
VERA JOHNSON: I 'm not sure I understand , Professo Franklin you wrote your doctoral thesis on my husband ?
TOMMY: He was a great man , Mrs. Johnson . He did so much for my people .
VERA JOHNSON: He did ?
TOMMY: Oh , yes . I 'll never forget when he said 'Welfare is a drug and you got ta kick it cold turkey . ' It was inspirational .
VERA JOHNSON: Really well , I 'm sure
TOMMY: And I was actually in the audience when he said , 'If you people would just get off your dead asses and look for work , this country might e fit to live in again . ' Powerful stuff .
VERA JOHNSON: It 's very kind of you to say so . And you 're very kind to come all the way from where was it ?
TOMMY: Wilson-Pickett State Teachers College . But I did n't just come to pay espects , ma'am . I came because your husband deserves an archive . A place where scholars can study his legacy . A storehouse for the ecord of his remarkable career .
VERA JOHNSON: I see . So you want his papers ?
TOMMY: Oh , not just his papers , Mrs. Johnson . Everything . Buttons , posters , bumper stickers . All the paraphernalia of his campaigns proof of his political genius . Now I realize that you may have a sentimental attachment to a few items
VERA JOHNSON: Take 'em .
TOMMY: I beg your pardon .
VERA JOHNSON: Take 'em all . Would you like the wedding photos , too ?
TOMMY: Well , I do n't think that 's necess
VERA JOHNSON: Good that way you wo n't have to go rooting around in the garbage . Is there anything else ?
TOMMY: Well , um no .
VERA JOHNSON: More tea ? Or something stronger ? I know it 's only ten-thirty , but , hell , sun 's over the yardarm somewhere , right ?
TOMMY: Actually , ma'am , I should be getting ack .
VERA JOHNSON: You 're in pretty good shape for a professor . D'you work out ? Tommy rises and packs his briefcase hastily .
TOMMY: Look , I , um , have a class to teach . You know how blind students are they 're so dependent . Do n't worry ma'am you materials will be in good hands .
VAN DYKE: Are you sure you do n't want to come to Washington with us , Homer ?
HOMER: You bums got time on your hands . I got a business to run . ON LORETTA working the RINGING pay phone .
LORETTA: Hello ? Who ? The League of Women Voters ? Sorry , Mr. Johnson wo n't be attending the debate . No no , Betty , I 'm sorry , I ca n't tie up this line . Hello ? The Sarasota Star-Ledger ?

KORNGOLD: You name it , congressman . Issue papers , testimony , floor speeches
TOMMY: Tell you what I have in mind . I was just thinking , would n't it be a plus for old Ken Korngold if I was to how should I put this showcase some of his distillers ' products at my reception ?

FOURTH LOBBYIST: Uh , no thanks .
LORETTA: Really ? We 've got it in cream sauce and in wine sauce .
REINHARDT: I think I 'll pass .
TOMMY: What is this ? Where 's the cheese ?
LORETTA: The cheese guy did n't return my call . So I called the guy at the American Smoked Fish Institute .
TOMMY: Oh , that 's just wonderful . Sixty heavy hitters drop in , and I 'm feeding 'em cat food .
CELIA: Wow ! That 's smooth . After ten straight hours on my feet making small talk and breathing cheap cigar smoke , that 's exactly the kind of line I 'm ready to fall for .
TOMMY: Whoa , slow down .
CELIA: Sure , sure , forget it . Can you just tell me , which one 's Congressman Johnson ?
TOMMY: What if I said me ?
CELIA: Oh . I see . So tell me , Congressman , just how deep is the shit I 'm standing in ? Tommy has to laugh .

CELIA: We 're a public interest research and advocacy group . I 'd like to brief you on our priorities this session . Can I call your AA to get on your schedule ?
TOMMY: Why do n't you brief me over dinne tonight ?
CELIA: I want an appointment , Congressman , not a date .
TOMMY: Yeah , sure , we 'll type it up on the schedule , it 'll be an appointment , except with wine and flowers on the table .
CELIA: No thanks . I really should be going .
TOMMY: Wo n't you at least stay for a drink and some herring ?
CELIA: I 'm afraid I 'm busy .
TOMMY: Well then , can I tempt you with a smelt ?
CELIA: No thanks . Nice to meet you . I 'll be in touch with your office . I especially look forward to hearing your view on extending the sexual harassment law to include congressmen .
TOMMY: I love the way you say that . She slips out through the sea of revelers .
DODGE: I heard in the steam room you 're going to try to screw up my ethics ill .
MARSHALL: Not screw up . Amend .
DODGE: Come on , Eli , your amendments do n't have a chance in hell to pass . My ill is n't perfect , I know , but it 'll pass . And the President 'll sign it .
MARSHALL: `` Is n't perfect '' ? Dick , your bill 's the Incumbents Protection Act ! How can you even call it an ethics bill ?
DODGE: Because the public wants an ethics ill ! So that 's what we call it .
MARSHALL: But it 's got no teeth ! It wo n't change a thing , and you know it .
DODGE: Come on , Eli , you 're a politician , too . The less you 're going to do about something , the more you have to talk about it . You know that . They start walking .
MARSHALL: I see . We close the bank , we stop the rubber checks , we raise the prices in the barber shop , we stop fixing parking tickets , and abracadabra ! We say we 've cleaned up Congress . Well , I do n't think the American people want what this place has become .
DODGE: That 's the beauty of it ! They must , Eli they keep re-electing us .
MARSHALL: Not anymore ! This new Congress is full of new faces .
DODGE: Oh , I would n't read too much into that . A few extra retirements , some edistricting nothing more than that . It 's still business as usual up here .
MARSHALL: Eight point six .
DODGE: Power and Enterprise is about to fund a solar demonstration plant , Eli . It could mean a whole lot to a district new jobs , new construction that interest you ?
MARSHALL: You ca n't bribe me , Dick .
DODGE: Eli , the people who elected you . They sent you here to help them . Do n't you want to ?
MARSHALL: Not if it means supporting your bill . All you want is the perfect platform to campaign for Speaker . Dick Dodge . Mr. Clean . What a joke !
DODGE: Come on board , Eli . You know you ca n't save the world if you ca n't save your seat .
MARSHALL: We have n't met . Eli Marshall .
TOMMY: Tommy Johnson .
MARSHALL: I know . The Florida upset . Well , now that you 're here , what are you going to do with it ? You gon na feather your own nest , o are you gon na make something of your office ?
TOMMY: I plan to be as good a congressman as all the others .
MARSHALL: Exactly what does that mean ?
TOMMY: Well , ever since I got back from Nam , I 've wanted to do something about the rain forest
MARSHALL: No , do me a favor , do n't tell me . I try not to get depressed until the second week of a new session .
DODGE: Eli , you 'll excuse us we have a meeting .
TOMMY: Is this good news ?
DODGE: Well , it is a difficult assignment look at what we cover energy , health , telecommunications , environment the committee is constantly beset by a swarm of special interests . These are powerful people , they 've got all the money in the world , and they 're not shy about using it .
TOMMY: So this is very good news .
DODGE: Most members would give their right nut for it .
TOMMY: So what do you want from me , Dick ?
DODGE: Congressman I just want you to smile for the cameras .
REINHARDT: So , Congressman , welcome to the honey pot . You should be one happy freshman .
TOMMY: Yeah ? Well , I 'm not . I 'm suspicious . One thing I 've learned is , when somebody gives you something fo nothing , the nothing ai n't nothing . It 's something . What is it ? Why me ? Reinhardt puts his hand on Tommy 's shoulders .
REINHARDT: Congressman , I do n't want you to take this the wrong way , but you 're black . And I mean that in the nicest possible way .
TOMMY: Keep talking .
REINHARDT: Dodge wants to run for Speaker . And he ai n't gon na make it without votes from the black caucus .
DODGE: Tommy , someone I want you to meet

CELIA: But you have people waiting , and
TOMMY: That 's all right . They can wait .
CELIA: Well .
TOMMY: Wait a minute , you just got here . I clean my calendar , and you 're out the door . Let 's back up , give this stuff the attention it deserves . Car insurance Ira , what do you pay ?
IRA: Oh , I 've got an '85 Plymouth , about six-fifty a year
TOMMY: Six-fifty ? Highway robbery ! A chop shop would n't give you more than a hundred forty for a junker like that . Or so I 've heard . But I 'm flying blind here , I need depth . Could Miss Kirby put togethe a briefing ? Maybe schedule a Saturday or two to really dig into the issues ?
IRA: Oh we 'd be delighted . We 've got some figures that will amaze you .
TOMMY: I 'm sure you do .
CELIA: Well , we wo n't take up any more
TOMMY: Whoa , whoa , hold on , what about child safety ?
CELIA: Well , we 're sponsoring a bill imposing safety standards on imported toys
TOMMY: Great ! About time ! I hate imported toys . What about food additives ? How about we block out a few evenings , you can take me through the details .
IRA: Celia , if that 's what the Congressman wants any problem ?
CELIA: You want to do this in the evening ?
IRA: I 'm away for the next two weeks . She gives him a look . Ira turns to Tommy .

BULLDOG: You make a persuasive case , Eli .
MARSHALL: That was n't a yes .
BULLDOG: I promise to give it the attention it deserves . The Bulldog gives Tommy a friendly squeeze
MARSHALL: He took six hundred dollars off you that last hand , did n't he ?
TOMMY: Yeah , he 's taking a real shine to me .
MARSHALL: If I did n't know better , I 'd say you lost to him on purpose .
TOMMY: Nothing wrong with letting the chairman of the ethics committee oll you once in a while .
MARSHALL: You fit in real well up here . Too well .
TOMMY: So Eli , how come you have n't asked for my help with your amendments ?
MARSHALL: Give it a rest , Tommy . You 've got a great jump shot . But everyone knows you 're Dick Dodge 's boy .
TOMMY: I 'm nobody 's boy , mister .
MARSHALL: Do n't waste your outrage on me . I know what you are .
TOMMY: I 'm no different from anyone else .
MARSHALL: That 's not true . Some people here actually try to do something esides save their own ass .
TOMMY: You know , Eli , I like you , I really do . You remind me of my father .
MARSHALL: Oh , really ? How so ?
TOMMY: He thought I was scum , too .
MARSHALL: Are n't you going to vote ?
TOMMY: Vote ? Is that what that is ? We got a pool going in the office on when it 'll go off next .
TEACHER: Excuse me Congressman ? Do you have a moment ? We 're from the Hawthorne Avenue School , in Union , New Jersey ? I 'm Mrs. Kozlowski . Social Studies . We were just learning how a bill becomes a law . ( indicating the
BELLS: Was that a vote ?
TOMMY: Yes , it was .
TEACHER: And what did you vote ?
TOMMY: I voted `` Nay . '' It 's a terrible ill . It 'd destroy the fabric of American life .
TEACHER: And what was the vote on ?
TOMMY: Hey , Rafe ! Tell these kids what that vote was about .
RAFE: Well , it was a motion to reconside the motion to reconsider . Bo , passing by , intervenes .
BO: No , it was the rule on amending the eauthorization .
TOMMY: Which means ?
BO: Clean Air .
RAFE: School lunches .
TOMMY: You 're in excellent hands , kids .
O'CONNOR: You 're a gentleman , Tommy . We can always do bid'ness I like that in a Member .
TOMMY: Thank you , Tommy . I love you too .
O'CONNOR: Listen , I 'd like to do more money for you I just need to know your positions on a few issues .
TOMMY: Sugar price supports . Where do you think I should be , Tommy ?
O'CONNOR: Shit makes no difference to me . If you 're for 'em , I got money fo you from my sugar producers in Louisiana and Hawaii . If you 're against 'em , I got money for you from the candy manufacturers .
TOMMY: You pick .
O'CONNOR: Let 's put you down as for . Now what about putting limits on malpractice awards ?
TOMMY: You tell me .
O'CONNOR: Well , if you 're for 'em , I got money from the doctors and insurance companies . If you 're against 'em , I got money from the trial lawyers . Tell you what , let 's say against . Now how about pizza ?
TOMMY: I 'll stick with the salad .
O'CONNOR: Not for lunch , shmuck , for PAC money . A lot of the frozen pizzas use phony cheese . There 's a law pending requiring them to disclose it on their labels . Where do you stand ? Tommy thinks it through .
TOMMY: If I vote for the labelsthen I get money from the dairy industry
O'CONNOR: Good
TOMMY: And if I vote against the labels , I get money from the frozen food guys .
O'CONNOR: Excellent ! And do n't forget the anchers , because they get hurt if pepperoni sales go down !
TOMMY: A pepperoni lobby . I love this town .
O'CONNOR: So which is it ?
TOMMY: Fuck the cheese people . Thanks to them my office smelled like smelt for a week .
O'CONNOR: All right . For .
TOMMY: So Tommy , tell me with all this money on every side , how does anything get done ?
O'CONNOR: It does n't ! That 's the genius of the system !
CELIA: It comes down to a question of what is acceptable risk . Are we willing to feed our kids a substance that causes cancer in lab rats ? More important , who gets to make the decision ? Bureaucrats and big corporations , or the people whose lives depend on it ?
VAN DYKE: Mr. Willie ? Congressman Johnson is calling . Can you take his call ? Thank you . Please hold .
ARMANDO: That 's right , Mr. Brown , on the thirtieth A thousand a coupleA whole table ? He 'll be so happy to hear it . Thank you so much . Loretta ! Put down nuclear powe for ten g 's .
LORETTA: Cool . Mr. Newburg ? It 's Miss Loretta , from Congressman Johnson 's office , how you doin ' ?
CELIA: And in the 1988 study , it was up to eight per hundred-thousand . Umam I losing you on these mortality rates ?
TOMMY: No , I was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem , and how much is a regulatory one ? I mean , did n't the Merton Act cover most of this ?
CELIA: Hmmm , that 's an excellent point . Let me see something
TOMMY: Well , for Merton to apply you have to show high contagionsounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod .
CELIA: I see . Well , I must say I 'm pretty impressed .
TOMMY: You 're also impressively pretty .
CELIA: Oh come on
TOMMY: You 're right . Sorry . Excuse me a second . Arthur ?
GUN LOBBYIST: Frankly , we think the semi-automatic has gotten a bad rap . That 's why the American Sporting Gun Users PAC put together this trip .
TOMMY: Must have had a heart attack .
BOB HOPE: I knew all these congressmen get a slice , but I did n't know it was that big .
TOMMY: Did you miss me ?
CELIA: Where did you go ?
TOMMY: Oh , a fact-finding mission , some issue conferences , a few speaking engagements , a charity event the usual .
CELIA: More like the Petroleum Institute Ski Cup , the NRA Open , the
TOMMY: Hey . Have lunch with me tomorrow .
CELIA: I ca n't we 're having a press conference .
TOMMY: What is it the ozone layer ? No fault ? Killer apples ?
CELIA: Toy safety . Wait a minute . Tomorrow 's Friday . Are n't you ack early ?
TOMMY: You remembered ! That means you missed me .
CELIA: Oh , I was for a while . It depressed me .
TOMMY: At a hundred grand a year , how depressed can you get ? Does n't it depress you to lose all the time ?
CELIA: Sometimes . Mostly it gets me angry . And the anger keeps me going . Sure , I would n't mind winning a few . And it 's not like I 'm allergic to money
TOMMY: So why do you do it ? She skips a stone on the water .
CELIA: God , it 's so embarrassing to come out and say it .
TOMMY: Say it .
CELIA: Meaning . I need my life to mean something .
CELIA: My question is , how 'd you get named after a Memorial ?
TOMMY: Grandma like Jefferson . Y'know , `` Life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . '' It 's a lot to live up to , so I specialized in the last part .
CELIA: And how 's the pursuit going ?
TOMMY: Fine'til I met you . Nowthe etter I do , the worse I feel .
CELIA: How about Sunday morning ?
TOMMY: Brunch ?
MARSHALL: The wages of sin is death ! And to the man who values Gold ove Goodnessthe Lord allows no exemptions !
AMEN: And to the man whose pockets are ulging and whose soul is empty the Lord grants no 90-day extension !
TOMMY: This is one hell of a date .
MARSHALL: Hello , darling . Glad you could make it .
CELIA: I liked the sermon , Uncle Eli .
TOMMY: Uncle Eli ?
MARSHALL: My niece says you 're not half as slimy as I thought .
TOMMY: Your niece ?
MARSHALL: That would put you somewhere etween a lizard and a toad . Quite a step up .
TOMMY: How could I have missed the family resemblance ?
TOMMY: Ladies ! Looking good ! How can I help you folks today !
HATTIE: Do n't `` Ladies ! '' me , you dick ! The camera lights go on .
DODGE: Now let me get this straight . You voted to make people on Medicare pay more money to their doctors ?
TOMMY: The Medical Association made a persuasive case . Ten grand from their PAC , plus Christmas in Aspen .
DODGE: Tommy if I 'm not mistaken , you would n't be here without the good senior citizens of your district . You got to dance with the girl that brung you , son . If you have a bit of business to do , do it quietly in the corridors in the subcommittees with little amendments . You mess around on the big ones like Medicare , you 'll e dead meat on election day .
TOMMY: Yeah , well , then it 's thanks fo the memories , and on to the next gig .
DODGE: Do you know what your problem is , son ? You do n't think big enough . You have a real knack for this town , but you have the soul of a two-bit hustler . Listen to me , Tommy .
TOMMY: Which is ?
DODGE: Getting re-elected .
TOMMY: Wait a minute . You 're talkin ' 'bout my re-election ?
DODGE: You do n't know what percent of the incumbents who ran last time got e-elected , do you ?
TOMMY: Fifty ? Sixty ?
DODGE: Ninety-six . And ninety-eight efore that . It 's like that election after election . If you do n't fuck up , you can be here , aking it in , for life . Life , Johnson . Tommy considers this . Then a big smile .
TOMMY: I can think of worse places to get life .
DODGE: I knew you had it in you .
TOMMY: So how do I get the Silver Foxes off my ass ?
DODGE: Oh , throw them a bone why do n't you co-sponsor a bill fo mandatory universal health insurance ?
TOMMY: What 's that mean ?
DODGE: Nothing . It 'll never pass .
VAN DYKE: May I help you ?
MRS. JUBA: Yes , I 'm Ellen Juba . This is my daughter , Mickey . We 'd like to see our congressman . We live in the district .
VAN DYKE: Just a moment , please . Could you come out ? Thank you . Be right with you . I like your hat . Loretta comes out and extends a hand .
LORETTA: How do you do , I 'm Miss Loretta , public liaison for the congressman .
MRS. JUBA: Ellen Juba . My daughter Mickey . We 'd like to see him .
LORETTA: Y'all from the district ? Up here seein ' the sights ? How 'd you folks like some gallery passes ? Go on over and listen to the great debates of our day ?
MICKEY: We do n't want to go to the gallery . We want to see Congressman Johnson .
LORETTA: How 'bout a House key ring for each of you ? Here see that ? Is n't that something ? Turns into a pen .
MRS. JUBA: You do n't understand . We 're not tourists . We 're constitutents .
LORETTA: You are n't with some organization , are you , honey ?
MRS. JUBA: I 'm a goddam citizen ! Is n't that enough !
MICKEY: We 're not leaving here till we see him !
LORETTA: Oh , Armando ? Could you come out front , please ?
TOMMY: Look what I won ! Must be that new racket . Armando has come out to hear this .
ARMANDO: There a problem , congressman ?
MRS. JUBA: Congressman ? You ? Armando tries to escort her out .
MICKEY: Let go of her , you creep !
SIXTH LOBBYIST: Careful , she may be armed !
MICKEY: Stop it ! Get away from her !
TOMMY: Wait . What happened to you ?
MICKEY: Not just me .
TOMMY: The others ?
MRS. JUBA: They call it a `` cancer cluster . '' Oh , at first , none of us in the neighborhood wanted to believe it , ut then we all saw it for me , it was when the two-year-old across the street developed a brain tumor , same as Mickey . We looked at everything the water , the air , dump sites , insects , you name it . But we did n't have to look that far . It was staring us in the face .
TOMMY: What ?
MICKEY: Power lines .
MRS. JUBA: High-voltage power lines . The wires cause magnetic fields and the magnetic fields cause cancer . Especially in children .
TOMMY: I never heard of that .
MRS. JUBA: The studies , the numbers it 's all there .
MICKEY: You 're not actually going to read those , are you ?
TOMMY: Oh , they 'll be read
MICKEY: Why do n't you come see fo yourself ? Tommy has no quick answer .
MRS. JUBA: Five children in the neighborhood have cancer . One more has precancerous lesions . Pregnant women around here are scared to death .
TOMMY: This is Mickey 's school ?
MRS. JUBA: Turns out a lot of schools are nea power lines . The land 's cheap , so the schools tend to buy it from the power companies in the first place .
TOMMY: But is n't the school district esponsible ?
MRS. JUBA: We asked the superintendent to measure the magnetic field inside the school . He said , Okay , only it 'll cost forty thousand dollars , and what program did we want him to cut that from ?
TOMMY: Nice .
MRS. JUBA: We 're nobody , congressman . You 're somebody . We need your help . Tommy takes Celia aside .
TOMMY: Do you believe it ?
CELIA: It 's impossible to know . No one 's eally looked into it hard enough .
TOMMY: But why is n't it being investigated ?
CELIA: Why did n't they investigate breast implants all those years ? What about those side-effects of that sleeping pill , Halcion ? Why is n't anything being investigated ? It 's always the same .
TOMMY: Money talks .
CELIA: You got it .
TOMMY: There must be something I can do for those people .
CELIA: Do n't tell me you 're actually developing a conscience .
TOMMY: Shit , I hope not it 'd be a fucking nuisance in Congress .
CELIA: No , that 's not fair . Some people on the Hill actually believe in things , and try to do a decent job , and do n't forget why they went to Washington , and who sent them .
TOMMY: No shit . Oh , yeah , I met one of those geeks . So what can I do ?
CELIA: Make a stink . Round up some Members and hold a press conference . Get that committee of yours to hold hearings . Haul in in the Environmental Protection Agency , the Surgeon General , the National Academy of Sciences . Get the issue on every breakfast table in America .
IOWA: This goes beyond personal tragedy . It goes to a public health hazard of unknown proportions . It goes to the right of ordinary people to know all the facts
TOMMY: Yeah , right people ought to know if their neighborhoods are killing them .
DODGE: What a fine effort this is . I am totally sympathetic . Congressional hearings should be scheduled as soon as possible . The American people deserve no less . He puts an arm around Mickey .
CELIA: Well , congratulations . You 've found yourself your own hopeless cause .
TOMMY: Speaking of hopeless causes They kiss , and slide OUT OF FRAME .
DODGE: On the rocks , or neat ?
TOMMY: Whatever you 're having .
DODGE: Well , why ruin good bourbon with the taste of some shitty Sears icemaker , that 's what I always say . Cheers .
TOMMY: Cheers . Dodge downs his drink . Tommy follows suit .
DODGE: Son , you 're a real comer . I would n't be surprised if you ended up in the leadership . I 'll say this if I were Speaker , I 'd sleep better with you as a lieutenant .
TOMMY: Why , thank you , Mr. Chairman . You know , to tell you the truth , I did n't know you 'd be on my side on those power lines .
DODGE: But I 'm not .
TOMMY: But you said you were sympathetic
DODGE: Of course I did . We 're all sympathetic to little girls with cancer . But I 'm not sympathetic to holding an inquiry .
TOMMY: But you said
DODGE: I know what I said . But that was just a press conference , son . I was n't under oath . The intercom BUZZES .
DODGE: What a surprise !
ANDERSEN: Mr. Chairman !
DODGE: Mr. Chairman ! Hello , Tommy . Zeke you 're looking well , good to see you .
ZEKE: Good to see you , you old sum ' bitch .
O'CONNOR: Evening , Mr. Chairman , thanks fo taking the Tommy , you s.o.b. , they let you in here ? You folks finally get to press flesh ! Olaf , meet Tommy Johnson . Tommy , Olaf Andersen . Chairman of Gulf Coast Power .
TOMMY: The boys here have told me a lot about you .
O'CONNOR: Yeah I told him you voted for him !
ANDERSEN: Glad to meet you , son . They tell me you 've got a real talent for the game .
O'CONNOR: And this is Zeke Bridges , CEO of Pyramid Insurance .
ZEKE: Congressman .
TOMMY: Good to meet you .
DODGE: Help me with these , would you , Tommy ? He hands Tommy a couple of drinks .
TOMMY: Chivas on the rocks ?
ZEKE: You look awfully familiar . Tommy just smiles .
DODGE: Tommy and I were just talking about power lines .
TOMMY: Yeah , what a coincidence . I thought this little party might be for me . You may not like this . I think we should hold those hearings .
DODGE: You really fell for the line that parents group fed you , did n't you ? Tommy is struck by Dodge 's intelligence .
TOMMY: How 'd you know I met the parents group ?
DODGE: Oh , I keep my ear to the ground , that 's what a good politician does . Listen , Tommy , why do n't we just get Olaf 's take on this .
ANDERSEN: It 's tragic , cancer 's a terrible thing , but there 's no way you can link it to power lines . Truth is , there 's a bigger electromagnetic field given off by an electric lanket , or a microwave oven , than y those derricks .
TOMMY: But there are studies that say
ZEKE: For every study that says one thing , I 'll show you a study saying another . We 've studied it ourselves . Nada .
ANDERSEN: There 's not a single state health official anywhere in this country who says power lines cause cancer .
TOMMY: But what if you 're wrong ?
ANDERSEN: `` Kill us '' ? `` Kill us '' ? You calling me a murderer ? You 're saying there 's lood on these hands ? How dare you talk to me like that , you O'Connor puts a restraining arm on Andersen .
O'CONNOR: Calm down , Olaf , calm down , he did n't mean it that way , did you , son ? Alright , gentlemen . Easy .
ANDERSEN: Tommy do you want to move the powe lines ? Do you know how much it would cost to bury them ? Millions . Tens of millions . I do n't have that money . The state does n't have that money . You people up here sure do n't have that money . You know who 'd end up paying for it ? Folks who sent you here , that 's who .
O'CONNOR: Now how 'd you like the people in your district to think of you as the putz who tripled their electric bill ? You think they 'd thank you for that on election day ?
TOMMY: All I 'm saying is , maybe we should hold hearings to look at
O'CONNOR: Think for a minute , boychik . You hold your hearings . Overnight , everyone who lives near a substation finds the value of his home in the toilet . You kill the real estate market .
ZEKE: You kill the insurance companies .
O'CONNOR: You kill the school district .
ANDERSON: You kill the local economy .
DODGE: For a smart boy , you 're not thinking very politically . Tommy watches the LIGHTNING .
TOMMY: Maybe I should think about it .
DODGE: Yeah , the system ai n't perfect , ut the fleas come with the dawg .
ANDERSEN: Oh , by the way , Tommy , on a completely different subject You do n't have a state PAC yet , do you ? I 'd like to give you a hundred thousand dolla corporate contribution to start one up .
ZEKE: My company would be honored to do the same .
TJ: Can you do that ? I thought there were limits
O'CONNOR: Oh , it 's all aboveboard , we all elieve deeply in the rules . It 's just that the state rules are often more flexible about these things .
ANDERSEN: Are you interested ?
TJ: I 'm always interested in the happiness of my constituents .
DODGE: I 'll drink to that . Dodge and Andersen shoot each other a look .
CELIA: Mmmm
TOMMY: Mmmm
CELIA: So what did he say ?
TOMMY: Who ?
CELIA: Dodge . The hearings .
TOMMY: Oh I , uh , have n't asked him yet . Celia suddenly looks quite awake .
CELIA: Oh .
DODGE: You see that ABC poll ?
THIRD MEMBER: Free fall .
DODGE: President in trouble like that , he 's liable to do something desperate . Some damn fool stunt .
FOURTH MEMBER: Invade Japan .
FIFTH MEMBER: Declare war on Congress , more like it .
MARSHALL: You shafted me on the ethics bill .
DODGE: Hello , Eli , good to see you . Why do n't you loosen your tie ?
MARSHALL: It 's a closed rule . I ca n't get my amendments on the floor . I ca n't get a recorded vote . I ca n't get squat .
DODGE: Last time I looked , it was the Rules Committee in charge of that . This is n't the Rules Committee , Eli . This is the steam room .
MARSHALL: This is the U.S. Congress ! The American people deserve better than
DODGE: You know what your problem is , Eli ? You 've got sermonitis . The other Members chuckle .
MARSHALL: I 've got news for you , Dick . I 'm going to run against you for Speaker . I may not have a rat 's ass of a chance to beat you . But I sure as hell can tell the world the kind of sleaze you stand for .
DODGE: I went too far with him , I know it . You know him pretty well , do n't you ?
TOMMY: Oh , I do n't know
DODGE: Come on , you play basketball together , you 're seeing his niece , you 've been to his church
TOMMY: How did you know that ?
DODGE: He 'll listen to you , Tommy . I want you to go make peace between us . Tell him we 'll work something out on his amendments not a vote , I wo n't go that far , but at least he 'll get to say his piece on the floor . Just get him off my back . Can you do that for me ?
TOMMY: That 's not a question , is it ?
DODGE: That 's right . Is there a problem ?
TOMMY: No , no I 've still got my right nut , I can work with that .
WAITER: Another ?
TOMMY: Sure , why not .
MARSHALL: The honorable Dick Dodge .
TOMMY: You know , Eli , sometimes people do things they regret . Everyone makes mistakes . Fact is , Dick 's been under a lot of pressure lately
MARSHALL: That man 's a walking quid quo pro prid quo quid pro quo , and you know it . He put you up to this , did n't he ?
TOMMY: What do you mean ?
MARSHALL: Do n't shit me , Tommy . You 're Dick Dodge 's yes-man . I know what you 're up to . This is damage control .
TOMMY: I 'm not a yes-man . When Dick says no , I say no .
MARSHALL: You know why no one on the Hill drops a dime on anyone else ? Mutual assured destruction . Our little gentleman 's agreement . Everybody has something on somebody , so nobody has anything on anybody , because everybody wants to save his own ass .
TOMMY: Oh , yeah ? What do they have on you ?
MARSHALL: They think I 'm a pompous ass .
TOMMY: Shit , that ai n't no secret .
LORETTA: You sure they do n't want to be alone , Reinhardt ?
REINHARDT: No , no I bet they 've been talking about the ethics bill all night . Come on , Loretta , you 'll know how to get Marshall 's mind off business .
MARSHALL: Shit , this place is n't about passing laws any more . It is n't about doing good any more . All it 's about is eing here .
LORETTA: Well , as I live and breathe . Tommy !
TOMMY: Eli , this is Loretta Hicks , from my staff . Loretta , Congressman Marshall .
LORETTA: Pleasure to meet you .
MARSHALL: Entirely mine .
TOMMY: You know Reinhardt , my AA ? Marshall nods . Reinhardt turns to Tommy .
REINHARDT: Excuse me , congressman , could I just do a couple of quick calendar things with you ?
MARSHALL: Would you care for a drink ?
LORETTA: Tell you the truth , nothing for me .
MARSHALL: Well , when a pretty lady shoots him down , an old man knows it 's time to go home . Marshall rises , pulling out his car keys .
REINHARDT: Listen , you gentlemen look like you 've had a few Loretta , why do n't you be a designated driver ?
LORETTA: Excellent idea .
MARSHALL: Ah . The good Samaritan .
LORETTA: Good night , y'all . They leave .
REINHARDT: Now we 've already got the Bankruptcy Institute breakfast tomorrow , but if you do n't mind we could wedge in the Prune Board
TOMMY: I 'm packing it in .
REINHARDT: Can we talk while I drive you ?
TOMMY: Thanks , I 'll walk . I could use the air .
LORETTA: Come on , honey , no use you getting mugged .
TOMMY: Loretta ! Please ! Your mouth !
MRS. DODGE: Tommy Johnson .
DODGE: What 's wrong ? INTERCUT Tommy and Dodge .
TOMMY: How did you know ?
DODGE: Good news does n't come at this hour .
TOMMY: I went out with Marshall . We got into an accident . He 's out cold . I 'm okay . Dodge looks off balance .
DODGE: Were you driving ?
TOMMY: No . Someone else . Loretta . Dodge recovers his equilibrium .
DODGE: The girl from your office ?
TOMMY: Yeah . She 's out , too . I do n't like the way it looks . For anybody . Look . You said you wanted to get ack into Marshall 's good graces . Well , here 's an opportunity .
DODGE: Listen carefully . Tell the ambulance to take you to Walte Reed . It 's a privilege they give congressmen . It 's also the only hospital without a bunch of goddam eporters shtupping the nurses in exchange for leaks . They 'll keep it quiet . I 'll handle the police . You go home and keep your mouth shut .
CORRESPONDENT: That 's right , Tom . Marshall eportedly had alcohol in his blood . Also slightly injured was an unidentified woman whom police say has a record in several states fo prostitution . Tommy looks sick .
TOMMY: Oh sweet Jesus .
WASHINGTON ANCHOR: Linda , Congressman Marshall that 's Reverend Marshall , is n't it ?
CORRESPONDENT: Right you are , Tom . How this plays into his longstanding campaign to eform congressinoal ethics is now anyone 's guess .
WASHINGTON ANCHOR: Thank you . In other news Tommy leaps for his clothes .
CELIA: Get away from him . He approaches her .
TOMMY: I have to talk to you .
CELIA: Go away !
TOMMY: I was set up !
CELIA: You were set up ? You were in the car ! I did n't hear your name on the news !
TOMMY: No , someone screwed him
CELIA: `` Someone '' ?
TOMMY: Celia , something stinks here
CELIA: Yeah it 's you ! You do n't give a damn about anything ! And to think , the other night , I actually thought you cared about someone else .
TOMMY: If you 'd give me a chance to
CELIA: God , I hate this town the only eason I stay is because I hate it so much .
TOMMY: Celia
CELIA: Get the hell out of here .
MICKEY: Is it thumb over , or thumb under ?
TOMMY: Under . She tries her hand at a false shuffle .
MICKEY: So what 's happening ? I thought you were going to kick some ass on
TOMMY: I am .
MICKEY: Six .
TOMMY: Who 's the mark ?
MICKEY: Number two over there .
TOMMY: Your deal .
MICKEY: That 's what you 're going to do ?
TOMMY: Something very important .
VAN DYKE: Why are we meeting here , Tommy ? There trouble at the office ?
TOMMY: `` I keep my ear close to the ground . '' His ear my ass . He had an inside man .
ARMANDO: That little fuck Reinhardt ?
LORETTA: Hot damn I knew my driving was n't that bad . Speaking of which you think I should wear one of those whiplash things , Tommy ? There some insurance angle I should be working here ?
TOMMY: We got bigger fish to fry , darlin ' .
VAN DYKE: What do we do ?
TOMMY: The big con .
LORETTA: We gon na git that sucker .
TOMMY: Dick always said I should think big .
ARMANDO: Whoa ! Are n't we gettin ' out of ou league , man ? That Dodge is a pro !
VAN DYKE: You ca n't con a con , Congressman .
LORETTA: Shit , that 's right , Tommy these politicians are serious slick fish .
TOMMY: You people gone soft on me ? Bunch of fuckin ' incumbents I got here . Now listen up . Thursday morning Dodge has a breakfast with the Arts Caucus in the Longworth Room . Armando find out how fast I can get from Longworth to my office . Loretta we need some scoop from the EPA fo the roper , I 'll give you a list . Van Dyke call Hattie at the Silve Foxes , and
LORETTA: Wait a minute we need a new roper , do n't we ? Everyone around here knows our faces .
TOMMY: Right on the nose .
DODGE: He did .
TOMMY: You kept my name out of it .
DODGE: I did .
TOMMY: I owe you one .
DODGE: You learn fast .
TOMMY: Do me one favor , Dick . Next time you pull some heavy shit involving my ass , tip me off , okay ?
DODGE: Alright , son . This hearing of the Power and Enterprise Committee is now in order . The health of America 's securities industry
TOMMY: Thanks . Listen , Reinhardt , something 's come up , and I do n't quite know how to handle it . There 's a guy from the EPA I do n't know him says he wants to see me . Tonight . Out of the office . Alone , he says . Sound of it makes me nervous . I 'd feel better if you were there .
REINHARDT: You got it , jefe .
TOMMY: Mr. Yancey ?
HOMER: I thought you 'd be alone .
TOMMY: He 's my AA . He goes where I go . If you can trust me , you can trust him .
HOMER: Congressman , I have information I think you may want . It 's about something going on at the EPA .
TOMMY: What have you got ?
HOMER: I got a wife and three kids , and a note on my house , that 's what I got .
TOMMY: Nothin ' comes for nothin ' in this town , do it ? You got any cash on you ? I 'm kind of light .
REINHARDT: You ca n't do that !
TOMMY: This stuff 's pretty good ?
HOMER: In the right hands , it could mean a great deal .
TOMMY: Okay . Sunday . Fifth race at Del Mar . Blueboy is running twenty to one . I 'd take a major position .
HOMER: You have to be shitting me .
TOMMY: No , not at all my Cousin Henry spends his days pumping water into horses ' stomachs and stuffing Percodan up their butts . Trust me .
HOMER: Alright . The White House is putting heat on the EPA . They want us to announce a major investigation of the relation between power lines and cancer clusters .
REINHARDT: But did n't the EPA already do a study ?
HOMER: Yeah , but when the draft got to the White House , they did n't like it . So they brought their own scientists in to kill it .
TOMMY: Why did the White House change its mind ?
HOMER: Who knows ?
TOMMY: Is there new evidence ?
HOMER: Yeah their polls have dropped like a rock . They need an issue . This one makes them look good on the environment , and they do n't have to spend a penny .
TOMMY: And what good is this to me ?
HOMER: Come on , congressman , in this town , information is currency . And advance information is gold . Reinhardt nods in agreement .
REINHARDT: Blueboy . Twenty to one . Is you Cousin Henry always right ?
TOMMY: I ai n't got no Cousin Henry .
REINHARDT: Mrs . Dodge , it 's Arthur Reinhardt . May I speak to the Chairman , please ?
THIRD MEMBER: Unless there is further business , our caucus stands adjourned .
TOMMY: Got a minute , Dick ?
DODGE: I 'm listening .
TOMMY: The EPA is going to make a stink about power lines . The White House is pushing them to do a big study .
DODGE: That 's very interesting , my friend . I 've heard that , too .
TOMMY: Nothing gets by , do it ?
DODGE: But thank you , son I 'm glad you chose to share it with me . We do make quite a team , do n't we ?
TOMMY: I I hope it was n't my press conference that started this .
DODGE: No , this is a stunt for the polls .
TOMMY: So do you think there 's something in it for us ?
DODGE: If we got the EPA off Olaf Andersen 's ack , he 'd be extremely appreciative .
TOMMY: And how do we do that ?
DODGE: My committee writes the EPA 's programs . We audit their funds . We confirm thei appointees . I 've got them by the balls .
TOMMY: And you 're going to ? Tommy makes a squeezing gesture , grins .
DODGE: Oh , no , not at all just persuasion . Strenuous persuasion .
TOMMY: That 's allowed ?
DODGE: Persuasion , yes . Intimidation , no . But it 's a gray area . Who 's to say which is which ?
TOMMY: Dick , wait a minute should n't we check out the tip ? Make sure the EPA 's really going through with this investigation ?
DODGE: Of course . He should be in by now .
TOMMY: Who ?
DODGE: Skeeter Warburton , of course . Always go right to the top , son .
TOMMY: There 's a vote on the floor . and ducks into the stairwell .
VAN DYKE: Here he comes .
TELEPHONE MAN: And there he goes .
TOMMY: The Administrator . Loretta picks up the phone .
LORETTA: Office of the Adminstrator . Thank you , I 'll put you right through .
TOMMY: Warbuton here . Thank you . Mr. Chairman ! I do hope there 's something I can help you with today .
DODGE: I need a straight answer from you , Skeeter . Is the White House on your ass about power lines ?
TOMMY: Off the record ?
DODGE: Of course .
TOMMY: I was looking forward to some serious sailing this week Tish and I have a lovely spot right by Kennebunkport . Instead , here I am at three in the morning , writing testimony to your committee about cancer clusters .
DODGE: Thanks for your candor , Warburton .
TOMMY: Not at all . You must come sailing with us . Cheers . Bye-bye . Tommy passes the phone back to Loretta .
ANDERSEN: Yes ?
LORETTA: I 'll just put you through to him . She passes the phone to Tommy .
TOMMY: Olaf ? Olaf , Zeke Bridges . Listen , you sum ' bitch , I 'm so mad , I ca n't sit down to shit . Have you heard what I heard ? INTERCUT with Andersen .
ANDERSEN: What 's that .
TOMMY: The EPA 's fixing to make a big stink about power lines and cancer . They 're going to serve us up for breakfast .
ANDERSEN: Wait a minute . There 's no scientific proof
TOMMY: Proof do n't mean shit . We 're talking politics . They make a federal case out of power lines , I 'm screwed . Whole insurance usiness is screwed . You know how much cash I 'd have to pay out in settlements ? Even if I stiffed everybody on claims , the legal fees 'd be enough to kill me .
ANDERSEN: I ca n't believe it .
TOMMY: You better believe it . You 're screwed , too . Every hot dog trial lawyer in America soon be lining up to sue both our asses . We got to move on this , Olaf . If I was n't tied up here , I 'd go to Washington myself . Should n't you be getting on a plane ? Just between us you find a way to stop this , I 'll find a million bucks if I have to .
DODGE: Olaf will be at my office at five o'clock .
TOMMY: How do we play it ?
DODGE: Cool . Real cool . You just follow my lead .
O'CONNOR: DODGE I do n't know how I can help you on this one , Olaf . This is the EPA . This is the President .
ANDERSEN: This is my lifeblood !
DODGE: I see that , Olaf , I see that . But in this town , you pick your fights .
ANDERSEN: This could mean six figures , Dick .
ANDERSEN: Seven figures ?
TOMMY: Between us . It 's not that much what can you get for half a million these days ?
ANDERSEN: How the hell can I funnel that kind of money to you ?
O'CONNOR: If that 's what you want , we can always find a loophole . No one will see your fingerprints .
ANDERSEN: No one will know ?
DODGE: No one will know .
O'CONNOR: You 're only in trouble if someone can prove a connection .
DODGE: Of course there 's no connection . Olaf 's just making a contribution as a patriotic citizen . And in eturn for it , he 's getting
TOMMY: Good government .
DODGE: Exactly . A little access , that 's all .
TOMMY: Hi .
CELIA: Excuse me .
TOMMY: Look . Whatever you think of me , just promise me one thing .
CELIA: What ?
TOMMY: Power and Enterprise . Noon .
CELIA: But why ?
TOMMY: Should n't we be heading off , Dick ?
DODGE: Let 's work the room just a bit more .
DODGE: Well . Look who 's over there Skeeter Warburton from the EPA . The very man we want to see .
TOMMY: Have you tried the oysters , Dick ?
DODGE: At a hazardous waste event ? I think we 'll go talk to him .
TOMMY: No , he 's the wrong man
DODGE: You do n't understand he 's the perfect man .
TOMMY: But but you do n't want to bothe him with this . Talk to one of his underlings
DODGE: Nothing beats man-to-man .
TOMMY: Here ? Not here !
DODGE: A public place . What could be better ?
TOMMY: But it 's the wrong time !
DODGE: While the iron is hot , son .
REINHARDT: No time like the present .
TOMMY: Shut up , Reinhardt , I 'm talking to the Chairman . Beat it , okay ?
REINHARDT: I 'll go get him . Reinhardt heads for Warburton .
TOMMY: You heard about this stomach thing going around ?
DODGE: Come on , son , we 've got the people 's business to do .
WARBURTON: Mr. Chairman . Congressman .
DODGE: I 've got a big problem , Skeeter .
WARBURTON: What 's that ?
DODGE: Your power lines investigation .
WARBURTON: What power lines investigation ? Tommy is sweating bullets .
DODGE: We 're off the record , Skeeter . This witch-hunt for cancer clusters is bad news for everyone .
WARBURTON: I do n't know what you 're talking about , Dick .
DODGE: Alright , I know you 're being a good soldier
WARBURTON: No , I 'm being straight with you
DODGE: Then let me be straight with you . You announce this study I 'm not talking about the results down the road , mind you , I 'm just talking about the announcement and there 's broken crockery everywhere . Real estate . Utilities . Insurance . Schools . Local governments . It 'll cost jobs . Uproot families .
WARBURTON: I agree with you completely . There is n't going to be an investigation , old chap , I promise you .
DODGE: I 'm glad we understand each other .
WARBURTON: Yes , I think we do . Tommy silently rejoices in his good fortune .
DODGE: And we 'll just forget about that phone call this morning ?
WARBURTON: We did n't speak on the phone .
DODGE: Excellent .
TOMMY: `` There is n't going to be an investigation , old chap . ''
DODGE: You 're bad .
DODGE: Worked like a charm . We scared him shitless . The investigation 's dead .
ANDERSEN: Waiter ! Champagne ! See you at the Clear Air hearings .
TOMMY: Morning , Reinhardt ! Got a minute ? I need your advice on something .
REINHARDT: Sure . Tommy leads him back into the corridor .
VAN DYKE: Is this the assignment desk ? Yes , I 'm calling from Chairman Dodge 's office , on the Hill . We wanted to be sure CNN was sending a crew to the Clean Air hearing today .
TOMMY: I want to do a little something nice for Dodge . That EPA thing he 's been good to me , Reinhardt . Is there some way I can , like , throw a ouquet to him at the hearing today without having to sit through that boring testimony shit ?
REINHARDT: Why do n't you ask him to give you the floor at the start ?
TOMMY: He 's do that ?
REINHARDT: For some flattery ? In a New York minute . Just tip him ahead of time .
TOMMY: Good thinking .

JULIE: Kale , could you grab the sugar ? Sugar ?
GILES: Why not . D.J . Caruso
KALE: I know , he 's a total freak , right ?
ASHLEY: And very vague did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a `` sinister message ? ''

KALE: Maybe . Ashley rolls her eyes .
ASHLEY: It 's called `` the day after , '' Kale . Nobody moves after a night like that .
KALE: Well what if she 's really `` not moving ? '' What if she 's tied in the dungeon with the other girl , starving to death

KALE: You 're leaving ?
ASHLEY: Have to . Party .

KALE: Oh my god , `` Skinny Psycho ? ! '' I sat next to that bitch in Spanish D.J . Caruso
ASHLEY: I told her my parents were outta town
KALE: And now the whole neighborhood 's coming .
ASHLEY: Look , I 'm stuck here . So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or try to make the most of it .
KALE: Hey , I get it . You do n't have to explain .
ASHLEY: Kale , you 're welcome to come , but
KALE: Well , I appreciate the thought . Really .
ASHLEY: Glad to hear it . Ashley turns to leave .
KALE: It 's funny , though .
ASHLEY: What ?
KALE: I did n't peg you as a conformist .
ASHLEY: Try to keep these in your drawers tonight , will ya ?
RONNIE: This is Ronnie , leave a message .
KALE: Yeah , I 'm calling about the Jeep Cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug it 's ready ? Listen , did they have to replace the whole tire they patched it ? Is there any way to tell if it was slashed or But a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile , does n't it ? I mean it 's a really slow leak , it ca n't flatten a tire in twenty minutes . Yeah , I guess anything 's possible .
KALE: Hey !
ASHLEY: Oh my God
KALE: Take it easy , that 's sixty gigs of my life .
ASHLEY: Even better .
KALE: Okay okay
ASHLEY: What are you doing ?
KALE: What are you doing ?
ASHLEY: I 'm trying to enjoy my party . Wait , that 's wrong . According to you , I 'm trying to conform
KALE: Coulda fooled me .
ASHLEY: What does that mean ?
KALE: Forget
ASHLEY: No , I 'm not gon na forget it .
KALE: You wan na blend in with that crowd , fine , then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me .
ASHLEY: So you were watching me . Question is for how long ? Just tonight ? O maybe a week ? Two weeks ? Since I moved in ?
KALE: It 's not a cover Over the above Ashley glances around
ASHLEY: So what is it , Kale ? Huh ? What else have you seen ?
KALE: What else have I seen ?
ASHLEY: Yeah . What else ?
KALE: Okay I 've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three . Not two , not four , always three . I 've seen you 're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles . And you neve stuff the chips in , you savor each one by dividing it into four precise ites . I did n't know that was even possible . You 're also the first girl I 've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house . And what do you do out there ? You do n't talk on the phone , you do n't paint your nails , you read ooks . Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you 've got going on that you 'd put them on your shelf alphabetically , but you do n't . You system 's much more perfect . The ones you like go on the bottom , the ones you love go in the middle , and the ones you need , the ones you keep going back to well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia . You know what all this tells me ? You know how things should be . The world according to Ashley . And guess what ? It 's a very entertaining and beautiful thing . Even when it takes a hit . When you end up in a place like this when your parents dump thei aggage on you , or just when it seems like those curveballs are neve gon na stop It sucks , but just so you know I get it .
ASHLEY: That was either the creepiest o the sweetest thing I 've ever heard .

THE SLAVES: .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven witnesses who can attest to that fact .
DICKY SPECK: My damn legs busted ! Dr.SCHULTZ No doubt . Now , if you can keep you caterwauling down to a minimum , I 'd like
TO DJANGO: As I was saying , if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again , would you ecognize them ?
DJANGO: Yes . Dr.SCHULTZ Now I 'm sure . to you , all unshaven white men look alike . So Django , in a crowd of unshaven white men , can you honestly
DICKY SPECK: I 'm gon na lose this leg ! Dr.SCHULTZ Yes , unless you find a talented physician very quickly , I 'm afraid that will be the . end result . But back to business , how much do you want for Django ?

HE EXPLAINS;: Dr.SCHULTZ Well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash , a bounty hunter , deals in corpses .
DJANGO: What 's a bounty ? Dr.SCHULTZ It 's like a reward .

DJANGO: I know what they look like , all right . Dr.SCHULTZ Good . So , here 's my agreement . You travel with me till we find them -
SHERIFF SHARP: Okay boys , fun 's over , come on out .

MARSHALL TATUM: You unarmed ? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes indeed we are . Marshall Tatum , may I address you , your deputies , and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey , as to the incident that just occurred ?
DJANGO: What'cha mean ? Dr.SCHULTZ Well , after this Brittle business is behind us , you 'll be a free man , with a horse , and seventy five dollars in your back pocket . What 's your plan after that ?

DJANGO: Me and my wife do . Dr.SCHULTZ Where is she now ?
SCHULTZ SAYS;: Dr.SCHULTZ So your plan is to trackdowri your wife , and purchase her.freedom ? Only you do n't know where she is ? A chewing Django nods his head , yes .
DJANGO: A few months ago . Dr.SCHULTZ Three or four ?
Z3: Dr.SCHULTZ The bad part about slavery being a business , is it 's immoral . The good part about it being a business is , they keep records . Somewhere in Greenville there 's a book with your wife 's name in it , and the name of the customer who
DJANGO: I 'll have my freedom papers . Dr.SCHULTZ Yes you will . But say you show them to some ascals , and they take them from you and tear them up ?

BETINA: Ya want I should treat 'em like white folks ?
SPENCER: No that 's not what I said .
BETINA: Then I do n't know what'cha want Big Daddy .
SPENCER: Yes , I can see that .
HE THINKS: What 's the name of that peckawood boy from town works with the glass ? His mama works at the lumber yard ? He comes by and fixes the winda 's when we have a problem ? The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in ;
SPENCER: Yeah , that 's the boy 's name , Jerry .

SPENCER: Just who the hell are you two jokers ?
DJANGO: - They were goin by the name , Shaffer . Dr.SCHULTZ You know them by the name , Shaffer . But the butchers real names'were Brittle . These are wanted men . The law wants them for murder . I reiterate , this warrant states dead or alive . When Django and myself
SPENCER: Gimmie .

TO DJANGO: Load up the bodies as quickly as you can , and let 's get out of here .
BENNETT: Ai n't nobody gon na touch you and your Jimmie while you on my property . But for lettin ' a nigger kill a white man , and especially fo letting a nigger kill a white man in a audience of niggers , y'all ai n't gon na make it out of the county alive . Mark my words Schultz , by tomorrow morning your niggers gon na be stripped and clipped and hangin ' from my motherfuckin ' gate . Dr.SCHULTZ I 'm fully aware Bennett , that you and you egulator playmates are n't shy about killing for what you believe in .

RANDY: Oh shit , I just made mine worse . He puts it on-then says ;
TERRY: No , no one brought a extra bag !
RANDY: I 'm just asking .
DOUG: Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride ?
SPENCER: Shitfire , if you do n't wear 'em as you ride up , that just defeats the purpose .
REDFISH: I ca n't see in this fucking thing ! I ca n't breathe in this fucking thing ! And I ca n't ride in this fucking thing !
WILLARD: Fuck all y'all ! I 'm going home . I watched my wife work all day gettin ' thirty bags eady for you ungrateful sonsabitches !
RANDY: Okay , I 'm confused , are the bags on or off ? Robert takes off his bag , and says ;
ROBERT: I think we all think the bags was a nice idea . But , not pointing any fingers , they could of been done better . So how 'bout , no bags this time , but next time , we do the ags right , and then we go full regalia . Everyone takes off their bag .

Yeah , they holdin ' the pretty part of the whip , but it 's just a thin membrane separate 'em . And do n't think they do n't know it either . It 's about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know . But ya need 'em . Who the hell else ya gon na get to beat a niggers ass , other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself . But these mountain oys I use as trackers for the runaways , they the worst . Nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies . Now like that nigge gal we was talkin ' 'bout . I 'm sure it.was a pain in the ass , but with a lot of patience , that German lady taught Hildi how to speak German .
CON'T: Now these inbred hillbillies , on the othe hand , they can barely speak English . I ca n't understand a damn word most of 'em say . You could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee , 'fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork . I tell ya , if it was n't for catchin ' a nigger on the run , they 'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog . Billy Crash comes riding back .

CALVIN CANDIE: Now now , no beggin ' , no playin ' on my soft heart . You in trouble now , son . Now you need to understand I 'm runnin ' a usiness . Now I done paid five hundred dollars for you . And when I pay five hundred dollars , I expect to get five fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll ove and play dead . You 've fought three fights .
D'ARTAGNAN: I won every one .
CALVIN CANDIE: Well , yes you did . But that last one , you muddied the line between winning and losing .

CALVIN CANDIE: That 's my problem , they 're mine to burn . Your problem , right now , is making a good impression . And I want you to start solving that problem right now , and git them rooms ready . The Old Man looks up at his Master , and says ;
STEPHEN: Yes sir , Monsieur Candie .
CALVIN CANDIE: Dr.Schultz , this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister , may I present to you , Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly . Lara Lee does a southern lady bow .
LARA LEE: Well are n't you the charming gentlemen . You 're not from around here , are you ? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually I 'm from a far off land , Dusseldorf , to be exact .
CALVIN CANDIE: These two are in the market for a fightin ' nigger . So I thought I 'd invite 'em down , show 'em my stock .
LARA LEE: We 'll all have dinner tonight , right ?

TO BROOMHILDA: I 've been informed you do as well .
GERMAN: It would be my , pleasure to speak with you in German .
IN GERMAN: Please come inside Fraulein .
BROOMHILDA: Yes . How do you know that ? Dr.SCHULTZ Stands to reason who ever taught you German would also give you a German name . Can I pour you a glass of water , Broomhilda ?
GERMAN: I 'm aware you have n't spoken German in a long while . So I 'll talk slowly . I 'm only speaking German to you now , Broomhilda , in case Candie 's people are listening to us . Myself and a mutual friend of ours , have gone through a lot of trouble , and rode a lot of miles , to find you fraulein - to rescue you . He hands her a tall clear glass of water . She looks at him weird , rescue me ? Dr.SCHULTZ
GERMAN: I do n't got any friends . Dr.SCHULTZ
GERMAN: Who ? Dr.SCHULTZ
GERMAN: Where is he ? He points at the adjoining door . Dr.SCHULTZ
GERMAN: I promise .
DJANGO: Hey Little Trouble Maker . Obviously a pet name between them . Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock
STEPHEN: What you . whistlin ' , girl ?

BROOMHILDA: I dunno . Somethin ' I heard . I do n't know no.name .

BROOMHILDA: Thank you .
STEPHEN: I 'm just sayin ' , two days ago you wus ' in such misery here , you hadda run off . So you un off , we catch your ass an ' drag you back . Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in The Hot Box for ' 'bout ten hours . Now here you are two days later , whistlin ' while you work . I 'm just sayin ' , I.wouldn ' think you 'd have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout . .I 'm jus ' sayin ' .
BROOMHILDA: I 'm done here , may I be excused ?
STEPHEN: Yes you may . She moves off to another part of the house . He watches her shuffle off .
CALVIN CANDIE: Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames get started . His name was Joe-maybe one day he said he was cold.. .who knows ? Dr.SCHULTZ Irregardless , we all know Samson 's you est , and you 'll never sell him and I can see why , he 's a champion .
DJANGO: Samson 's the champion . The other two are pretty good .
LARA LEE: Hildi ! Broomhilda snaps back .
CALVIN CANDIE: Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson , no . Can he take Goldie , probably not - Goldie 's the est dirty fightin ' nigger I ever saw . But as long as you do n't put 'em up against those two. , Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass .
DJANGO: Maybe .
CALVIN CANDIE: Dr.Schultz , i will have you know , there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then , Monsieur Calvin J. Candie . But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game .
BEAT: A nigger that can win fights . That should e your first , second , third , four , and fifth concern . After you have that , and you know you have that , then , you can start to implement a grande design . But since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table status - beating Moguy by one year fo that honor allow the old sage to advise , first things first .
CALVIN CANDIE: I see you two gettin ' on ? Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin ; Dr.SCHULTZ .Famously .
DRAMATIC PAUSE: Monsieur Candie , you ca n't imagine what it 's like not to hear you native tongue for four years .
CALVIN CANDIE: Hell , I ca n't imagine two weeks in Boston .
Â»5: Everybody at the table chuckles . Dr.SCHULTZ I ca n't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue . And Broomhilda is a charming conversation companion .
LARA LEE: I do n't know doctor , you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want , but it looks like this ponys got big eyes fo Django .
CALVIN CANDIE: Stephen , you 're amazing . I have n't finished a drink in this house in twenty years .
STEPHEN: When a man likes a cold drink , a man likes a COLD drink . Chuckle . chuckle
CALVIN CANDIE: Did you overhear that joke I said about me spending two weeks in Boston
MOCK INDIGNANT: You do n't have any idea the work I do to see food gets on the table .
CALVIN CANDIE: What does that hafta do with the price of Tea in China ?
STEPHEN: You think when I 'm in that kitchen , I got nothin ' better to do then listen in here to you tellin ' unfunny jokes ? Chuckle . chuckle
MOCK INDIGNATION: What ? They laughed !
STEPHEN: Of course they laughed , their parents aised them right . When they 're a guest in somebody 's house , and the master of of the house thinks he's- funny , you suppose to laugh . They 'd be rude not to . Chuckle .chuckle
CALVIN CANDIE: No it was really funny ,
TO TABLE: was n't it ?
STEPHEN: Now what do you expect these people to say ? What you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest .
TO TABLE: Everybody do n't laugh at him , you 're being polite , I understand , you mean well , but it just encourages him . Chuckle-chuckle
STEPHEN: You know that nigger ? ï¿½ She spins around .
BROOMHILDAÂ€¢: Who ?
STEPHEN: Do n't stall me bitch , you know who ?
BROOMHILDA: At the table ? I do n't know him .
STEPHEN: You would n't lie to me now , would you ? She shakes her head , no . Stephen looks at her skeptical .
DJANGO: Eskimo Joe 's a quality nigger , no doubt about it . But if it was my money , I would n't pay twelve thousand dollars for him . Dr.SCHULTZ What would your price be ?
MOGUY: But the real question is , not how much he cost , but how much he can earn ? Dr.SCHULTZ Django ?
DJANGO: In a years time , seven or eight fights - outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland pedigree were n't well known - Virginia
CON'T: Georgia all goes well twenty to twenty one thousand dollars .
CALVIN CANDIE: Precisely Bright Boy , good on ya . Any way you cut that cake , that spells profit . Not to , mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a winner nigger . However let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about . It was n't me who came to you to sell a nigger , it was you who approached me to uy one . Now that nine thousand dolla figure Bright Boy was banding about , ai n't too far off from right . And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that , I could sell 'em any day of the week . But like you said in Greenville doctor , I do n't wan na sell 'em . It was only you idiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it .
THE KITCHEN: Stephen , time for dessert !
BROOMHILDA: Can I take away your dishes , Monsieur Candle ?
CALVIN CANDIE: Yes you may , Hildi . She begins gathering the dirty dishes . Candie looks up at her as she works .
BROOMHILDA: I like it a lot Monsieur Candle .
CALVIN CANDIE: It 's a lot better then sizzling in that hot box , or draggin ' your ass through a amble bush , ai n't it ?
BROOMHILDA: Yes 'em .
STEPHEN: You know Monsieur Candle , the doctor might e interested in seein ' Hildi 's `` peeled '' ack . Seein ' as he do n't see many niggers where he from .
TO SCHULTZ: When you was alone with Hildi here , didja just speak German , or did ya git he clothes off ?
CALVIN CANDIE: So you have n't seen her back ? Dr.SCHULTZ No I have n't .
LARA LEE: Calvin , I just got her all dressed up and looking nice .
CALVIN CANDIE: But Lara Lee , Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf , they do n't got niggers there . And he 's a man of medicine . I 'm sure it would fascinate him , the niggers endurance fo pain . I mean Hildi got something like fifteen lashes on her back . Lara Lee get one , she 'd lose her mind . These niggers are tough , no doubt about it .
LARA LEE: Calvin , we are eating - dessert , no less . Ai n't no one wan na see her whipped up back . Django continues to watching this play out . Stephen watches him . Candie folds .
CALVIN CANDIE: Okay okay Lara . Maybe after dinner . During the brandies .
STEPHEN: I thought you said you did n't know him ? Broomhilda turns around .
BROOMHILDA: Huh ?
STEPHEN: I said , you said , you did n't know him ?
BROOMHILDA: I do n't .
STEPHEN: Yes you do .
BROOMHILDA: Mister Stephen , I do n't .
STEPHEN: Why you lyin to me ? As tears begin to well in her eyes .
BROOMBILDA: I ai n't .
STEPHEN: Why you cryin ' ?
BROOMHILDA: Because you 're scarin ' me .
STEPHEN: Why am I scarin ' you ?
BROOMHILDA: Because you 're scary .
1ZL: His eyes to to Broomhilda .
STEPHEN: You , stay in the kitchen .
CALVIN CANDIE: Yes siree bob I did . Dr.SCHULTZ Well in that case allow me to propose another proposition ?
STEPHEN: - Monsieur Candie ?
CALVIN CANDIE: Stephen , you just interrupted Dr.Schultz .
STEPHEN: Oh , I do apologize , doctor . My hearin ' ai n't worth a damn these days .
TO CANDIE: Monsieur Candie , I need a word with you in the kitchen .
CALVIN CANDIE: What , you mean get outta my chair ?
STEPHEN: If you could manage it . It 's about dessert .
CALVIN CANDIE: What about dessert ?
STEPHEN: I would rather tell you in private .
CALVIN CANDIE: We 're having rhubarb pie , what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there ?
STEPHEN: Meet me in the library .
STEPHEN: Those motherfuckers ai n't here to buy no mandingos . They want that girl . -
CALVIN CANDIE: What the hell you talkin ' about ?
STEPHEN: They playin your ass for a fool , that 's what I 'm talkin ' bout . They ai n't here for no muscle bound Jimmie , they here fo that girl .
CALVIN CANDIE: What girl , Hildi ?
STEPHEN: Yeah , Hildi . The niggers know each other .
CALVIN CANDIE: He just bought Eskimo Joe .
STEPHEN: Did he give you any money ?
CALVIN CANDIE: Well not yet , but -
STEPHEN: - Then he did n't R ..Y diddly , not yet no how . But he was just about to buy , who he came here to buy , when I interrupted him . Thank you Stephen - you 're welcome Calvin .
CALVIN CANDIE: Where you gettin ' all this ? Why would they go through all that trouble , to . buy a nigger with a chewed up back , ai n't worth five hundred dollars ?
STEPHEN: Well they 're doin ' it cause Django 's in love with Hildi . She 's probably his wife . Now why that German gives a fuck about who that uppity son-of-abitch is in love with , I 'm sure I do n't know .
CALVIN CANDIE: If she 's who they want , why the whole snake oil pitch about mandingos ?
STEPHEN: Because you would n't pay no never mind to four hundred dollar . But twelve thousand got you real friendly . Calvin thinks .as per usual , Stephen 's right .
CALVIN CANDIE: Those lyin ' goddamn.time wastin ' sonsabitches !
LOUDER: Sonsabitches ! You just watch , I 'm gon na fix their wagon but good ! Stephen , we . gon na have us a Candyland tar and feathering !
STEPHEN: Now Calvin.. .not that I would n't enjoy seein ' something like that . but why do n't you sit down and let 's talk about this .
CALVIN CANDLE: I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin ' huckster insinuate themselves at my dinner table , and play this whole goddamn plantation for a fool !
STEPHEN: Calm-the-fuck-down , sit down , and let 's discuss this .
BEAT: Now we got it . .So let 's go back in there and busts these motherfucker 's chops .
LARA LEE: There you are ! I was beginning to think you and that of crow ran off together .
CALVIN CANDLE: That 'd be a hellva note , would n't it Lara Lee ?
CON'T: Lara Lee , I just looked out the big winda . Ace Woody 's out there dealin ' with some shady slaver sellin ' a passel of Ponys . Would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball . That of boy knows everything to know 'bout mandingos , But he do n't know diddly 'bout black puddin ' .
CALVIN CANDIE: Can I ask you two gentlemen to look ove your shoulder ?
BEAT: Mr.Moguy , would you be so kind as to collect the pistols hangin ' on those boys'hips ? Mr.Moguy does .
CALVIN CANDIE: Now where were we ? Oh yes , I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda . Right ? Dr.SCHULTZ Right .
STEPHEN: Stephen ! Bring out Hildi ! Ix ?
CALVIN CANDIE: Now it should be quite clear by now I know you 're not here to buy no mandingos . Reason y'all came to Candyland , is y'all want Broomhilda . But y'all do n't want me to know how much you want 'er . So instead , you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe horseshit .
TO STEPHEN: Stephen , put her in that chair .
CALVIN CANDIE: Now the way I see it , ai n't nothin ' changed.. You still wan na buy a nigger , I still wan na
CALVIN CANDIE: And if you think my price for this nigge is too steep , what I 'm gon na desire to do is , take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it . Right in front of both y'all .
TO SCHULTZ: Rhubarb pie ? Schultz looks at the pie and the man . Dr.SCHULTZ No .
CALVIN CANDIE: Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya ? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually , I was thinking of that poo devil you fed to the dogs today , D'Artagnan . And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this .
TO CANDIE: Normally Monsieur Candie , I would say ,
CALVIN CANDIE: One more moment , Doc ! Dr.SCHULTZ What ?
CALVIN CANDLE: I think you are a bad loser . Dr.SCHULTZ And I think you 're an abysmal winner .
CALVIN CANDIE: Bartholomew , if she tries to leave here efore this German shakes my hand . Cut 'er down . Schultz looks to Django . then to Candle..
CANDLE;: Dr.SCHULTZ . You really want me to shake your hand ? Django gets it .
CALVIN CANDIE: I insist .
DR: -Schultz smiles . Dr.SCHULTZ Well , if you insist . Django goes to stop him
TO DJANGO: I 'm sorry . I could n't resist .
SHHH'S HIM: Act like you still sleepin ' .
DJANGO: Where 's Broomhilda ?
TIMMY: Who ?

DJANGO: Well , it turns out I was a natural . Ace woody laughs .
ACE WOODY: Boy , people 'round here are cross wit you .

What I think , is you done fucked up my good thang . So when it comes to you , Django boy , you could say I got ta axe to grind .
ACE WOODY: How 's the blade of that Bowie feel against your ball sack , Blackie ? A Bowie right off the wet stone . Now that 's what I call sharp . Django dances some more
BREATH: On the count of three .
ACE WOODY: Got to do it , boy . TWO

ACE WOODY: You gon na look after our friend ?
STEPHEN: Oh yes sirree Bob , you know I am ! 01 ' Snowball and a certain naked ass upside down nigger we both know , gon na have us a big of chat .
BREATH: That was a good idea . I bet y'all could n't elieve how easy it was . You meet Moguy , he uys your horseshit . Ya ' git your ass invited to Candyland , no fuss no muss . Ya ' ride the
BEAT: And that 's where you met me . And that 's when you knew your goose was cooked .
STEPHEN: Now that fancy talkin ' white man of yours did n't know what 's what . He still thought his
STEPHEN: Now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours . Seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life , was comin ' up with different ways to kill you ASS . Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts . But while that might SEEM like a good idea . Truth is , once ya snip a niggers nuts , most bleed out . Then I say ; `` Hells bells , the niggers we send to LeQuint
DJANGO: Where 's Broomhilda ?
STEPHEN: She 's all right for now . Miss Lara soft hearted on 'er . She gave he to Billy Crash . He was sweet on 'er . Now Billy Crash might not look o smell too good , but ai n't nobody gon na bother her . Stephen limps away .

DJANGO: That 's what 's nice about this fortune , it 's not illegal . You ca n't steal it , ya got ta earn it .
JANO: If you got something to say , say it .
JANO: Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall ?
DJANGO: Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering gang of stagecoach robbers , The Bacall Gang . There 's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive ounty on him . And one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices ,
BEAT: But it do n't hafta be that way . You and you mates could get that money .
JANO: Who pays the money ?
DJANGO: The Court .
JANO: The Court ?
DJANGO: The Austin Texas Courthouse . Oh , and by the way , the court do n't give a damn about how you kill 'em . You can shoot 'em in the ack , from up on a hill , in the back of the head , in their sleep - do n't matter .
CON'T: Court does n't care how you do it , just as long as you do it .
JANO: They.pay us to kill 'em ?
DJANGO: No . You kill 'em , and they payyou for the corpse . Get it ?
DJANGO: Killed innocent people in a stagecoach obbery . I 've got the handbill in my pocket .

DJANGO: What about that cowboy fella in the lead ?
JANO: Roy ?
DJANGO: Can Roy read ?
JANO: Look , get it straight black , I can fuckin ead . I just do n't got my glasses .
DJANGO: I ai n't no goddamn slave . Do I sound-like a fuckin slave ? I 'm a bounty hunter . Yesterday as a free man , I rode into Candyland on a horse with my white German partner , Dr.King Schultz . We 'd tracked The Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to Chickasaw County . Found them laying low at Candyland . We went in to get 'em , things went sour . My partner was killed , and Calvin Candie was shot . Everybody there decided to lame me , so here I am .
TO ROY: You know I 'm not on the manifest ? All of you know I 'm not suppose to be on this trip . But those four men , are still back there .
ROY: What 's your deal ? You tell us who they are and we let ya go ?
DJANGO: I ai n't tellin ' who they are . But , you give me a pistol , and a horse , and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred , and I 'll point 'em out to you .
DJANGO: Y'all wan na ask somebody if I 'm tellin the truth , ask them mandingos . You ca n't put me in the same cage with them without them killin me . Why ya think that is ? Ask them .am I a Candyland slave , or did I ride in
READING ALOUD: `` Wanted , dead or alive . Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang . For murder and stagecoach obbery . Seven thousand dollars for Bacall . One thousand five hundred dollars for each
FLOYD: Just because the handbill 's real does n't mean that other bunch of malarky.is .
ROY: Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead or alive handbill in his pocket ? Floyd does n't have an answer for that one .
CHESTER: Yeah . They walked us from the Greenville Auction and he rode on a horse with a white man .
ROY: This white man , was the black his slave ?
RODNEY: He were n't no slave .

SYLVIA: You know , you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he 's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and oots out of the ground .

LEON: Oh no !
MORETTI: He 's got eight people in there with him . He 's got this kid with him they 're gon na shoot the people .
LEON: I ca n't help it . I ca n't stop him from anything .
MORETTI: If he wo n't listen to you , who will he listen to ?
LEON: He wo n't listen to anybody . He 's een very crazy all summer . Since June he 's been trying to kill me .
MORETTI: You try calling the police ?
LEON: What good is that ? They could n't stop him . And it 'd just make him mad . They do n't know him .
MORETTI: Somebody 's got to stop him , Leon .
LEON: He was under great strain you do n't understand , he 's a very mixed up person .
MORETTI: He 's makin ' threats in there .
LEON: He 's scared . It 's crazy . I neve met anyone like him . His wife , he 's a wonderful father to his children . His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back , he sees them , he pays their rent . Unbelievable . I wanted to get married He did n't eally want it he 's married already ! But he did it . I do n't know why . I thought it would help me , but it did n't . I was just as confused and unhappy was before ; I did terrible things .
MORETTI: What kind of things , Leon ?
LEON: Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking ; he did n't know where I was who I was with . I could n't explain why I did the things I did . So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man 's body . So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation but where was he to get that ? 2500 dollars ! My God , he 's in hock up to his ears already .
MORETTI: He needed money ? For the operation for you ?
LEON: It made him crazy - so much demand , he 'd fly into this rages . And I got more depressed than ever ; I saw I 'd never get the operation . So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills blues , eds , yellows , downers , uppers , screamers you name it . But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital . Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says 'Wow ! ' So when I hear he 's in the bank , I almost go crazy because I know he 's doin ' it for me .
MORETTI: Well , do n't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there ?
LEON: I ca n't talk to him .
MORETTI: You 're in it up to your ass , Leon . You 're an accessory . You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of you case .
LEON: I 'm afraid .
MORETTI: How is he gon na hurt you on the telephone ?
LEON: I do n't know what to say to him . I ca n't .
MORETTI: You think it over , Leon .

RAY: Hey man it 's great , do n't listen to em , it 's non-linear man , it 's poetry man , everything Godard stands for .
INSTRUCTOR: This is pretty shocking stuff Mr. Morrison . And I might say indulgent . Naziism and masturbation , when used for shock value , are not art . But to e constructive , let 's start with your intention . What was it ?
STUDENT 1: It was a bore ! ! That 's what !
TRICK: Hey it was better ' n a Warhol picture .

BONES: You ca n't quit , you got ta voice . People ca n't dig cause they do n't understand yet .
JACK: If you 're an individual , if you 're too good , they wan na cut your dick off . Look what happened to Orson Wells .
TRICK: You quit now , they 'll yank you deferment in no time and they 'll get you for Vietnam man . Three more months you graduate .
BONES: Be cool , you never learned fuckin patience Morrison , you want everything at once .

JIM: A vast radiant beach And a cool jewelled moon Couples naked , race down by its quiet side And we laugh like soft mad children There 's a crash . They turn bristling .
PAM: Okay just talk though . No funny stuff .
JIM: Okay . I promise .
PAM: I 've been real upset . I lost my ca on the freeway yesterday . I left it somewhere and I ca n't remember where and when I went back it was gone . My sister
JIM: I bet you never expected life could e this hard . And you 're still so young .
PAM: I really do n't want to know
JIM: Come on .
PAM: These are like beautiful ! I neve ead much poetry in school . I hated it . What 's a `` shaman '' ?
JIM: He 's the medicine man who starts in a peyote trance . And he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his vision and it heals them . It 's the same in all cultures Greeks , Jesus . Some Indians say the first shaman invented sex . He 's the one who makes you crazy .
PAM: Are you a `` shaman '' ?
JIM: Uh no . I just write about it . What turns you on ?
PAM: I do n't know . Experience . Freedom . Love Now . Peyote 's like love . When it 's given it 's blessed . When it 's sold it 's damned . I like peyote . I like acid , it 's easier to get . I like the spiritual voyage . The first time I did acid I saw God . I did . I had a friend who was Christ . And he was Judas too . I suddenly knew the secret of everything that we 're all one , the universe is one . And that everything is beautiful .
JIM: Is it ? I do n't know . I think you 're alive by confronting death by experiencing pain .
PAM: I think you 're alive by recognizing eauty seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is we 're all saying the same thing . It 's `` love me and I 'll love you . ''
JIM: It 's only thru death that you know life . Jesus , medicine men heal people y sacrificing their own life .
PAM: Do you love Death ?
JIM: I think life hurts a lot more than death . When you die the pain is over . Pam shivers , a strange thought .
PAM: Why do I look at you and see my death ? No , that 's ridiculous .
JIM: I bet your dad 's a school teacher .
PAM: How did you know !
JIM: I do n't know .
PAM: What was your father ?
JIM: Military
PAM: I bet you moved around a lot .
JIM: Yeah , about 8 times .
PAM: How many sisters and brothers ?
JIM: Two .
PAM: One she 's the pretty one I love your neck .
JIM: `` but one , the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug ''
PAM: That 's beautiful . Who did you write it for ?
JIM: I wrote it for you .
PAM: take your time , Jim there 's no hurry , I 'm all you have to do tonight
DOORS SONG: Well the clock says it 's time to close now I guess I 'd better go now As we depart the rooftop . Your fingers weak with minarets Speaking secret alphabets I light another cigarette

RAY: Whatcha been doing ?
JIM: Writing . Poems . Songs .
RAY: Songs ? Lem me hear one .
JIM: I ca n't sing .
RAY: So neither can Dylan . `` Johnny 's in the basement mixing up the medicine , I 'm on the pavement thinking about the government '' . But he 's got the words man . That 's what they want .
JIM: Let 's swim to the moon un hunh Let 's climb thru the tide Penetrate the evening That the city sleeps to hide
RAY: Wow ! Y'know man those are hot lyrics really hot !
JIM: could you write the music fo that down , if we went over to you place , could you write that on you organ ?
RAY: Are you kidding ! I could fly . You wrote that ? You got others ?
JIM: A bunch . It 's like I 'm taking notes at a rock concert going on inside my head . I actually hear the music the spirit of the wine y'know , intoxication .
RAY: Man . You got a voice like Chet Baker haunted ! What the hell happened to you in the desert ? Let 's get a rock and roll band together man and make a million bucks .
JIM: be great would n't it ?
RAY: It 's the perfect time man ! Two of the guys outta my band are really into this . I meditate with them . You know them Robbie and John . We could have it in the can in three weeks .
JIM: Hey why not , I could write the songs with you guys .
RAY: The Stones did it outta the London School of Economics for Chrissake . Things are about to explode man . You can feel it in the air . Vietnam 's right out there . Sides are eing chosen . People wan na fight o fuck , love or kill , everything 's gon na flame . The planet 's screaming for change , Morrison . Make the myths man ! !
JIM: There oughta be great orgies man . Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece , he made all the women mad , leaving their homes and dancing off in the mountains . Great golden copulations in the streets of LA . Hey , do you know her ?
RAY: What do we call ourselves . `` Dionysus '' ?
JIM: I got a name .
RAY: What ?
JIM: The Doors .
RAY: The Doors ? That 's the most ridiculous you mean the doors in your mind ? Like the Huxley book .
JIM: `` The Doors of Perception '' ? Acid
RAY: Yeah sure mescaline experiments educing the sugar flow to the brain . Great book .
JIM: It 's from William Blake actually , the line `` when the doors of perception are cleansed things will appear as they truly are ''
RAY: infinite '' . It 's great , Jim .
JIM: So where do we start ? How do we start ? Where are the girls ?
RAY: Rehearsing . You 're moving off the ooftop and in with me and Dorothy .
DOORS SONG: Let 's swim to the moon Let 's climb thru the tide Penetrate the evening That the city sleeps to hide
JOHN: That 's really square . Let 's hip it up . Jump on your cues .
RAY: Tighten it up . Stay with the beat Jim . You 're dragging .
JIM: Let 's try it again , come on . I 'm just getting into it .
PAM: I think it 's hot ! !
ROBBIE: I still think the lyrics are weird man .
JOHN: I still think it sounds like the ottom of a fishbowl man .
JIM: Then you write one man ! We need more songs anyway . We all got ta go back and write .
ROBBIE: I been working on something goes like this A minor . `` You know that it would be untrue You know that I would be a lia If I was to say to you Girl , we could n't get much higher '' F sharp chorus `` Come on baby , light my fire Try to set the night on fire ''
RAY: Okay man there 's some good changes in there .
JIM: Got any more lyrics ?
ROBBIE: Some . I call it `` Light My Fire '' . I figger if I 'm gon na compete with your stuff it 's got ta be about earth , fire or snakes .
JIM: Do n't underestimate Death .
JOHN: Yeah but it sounds like the Byrds man , we 're not folk rock man . How 'bout trying it with a Latin beat .
ROBBIE: I thought we could do the usual verse chorus verse chorus and
JOHN: We do n't need a bridge .
ROBBIE: Yeah , we could maybe improvise a couple piano and guitar solos ove it `` The time to hesitate is through '' Du du duh dud dada . . .
JIM: `` No time to wallow in the mire Try now we can only lose And our love become a funeral pyre Come on baby light my fire '' John drumming it , different , more Latin .
RAY: Nice groove , John . Chaka chaka chaka , then bula burump bula you 're right , it could take a coupla long solos , that 's wild man , like Butterfield did on `` East-West '' eally hip .
ROBBIE: Y'ever heard Coltrane 's `` Favorite Things '' ?
JOHN: Yeah maybe stretch it out and put it in 4/4 on bass , 3/4 on guitar and snare .
RAY: Why not ! A minor to B minor . Jazz ! That then is jazz ! But it needs a hook . Something . Give me some space . I need some space . Leave the room guys . Come on ! Go !
JOHN: Guy 's obnoxious , man always bossin ' people around ! I thought we were equals !
JIM: Are n't we ? That was great Robbie . Whaddaya thinking about when you play ?
ROBBIE: Do n't know . Mostly the fish in my fish tank .
JIM: Hey whadya say we take some of that Tijuana acid and see what kinda trouble we can get into tonight ?

JERRY: We 're in Los Angeles punk , how would you know , they like your pants , they 're not listenin ' to you , what the hell they see in you I

JIM: No no no John John . God is crazy too . God is part insane as well as sane . Not in control all the time . Dionysus was the God of the wine . He made ecstasy but he also made madness . Madness is all right . That 's what you want , is n't it , is n't it ? Where 's that joint ?
ROBBIE: I get scared thinking of all the choices inside . I could go . I could stay . I can live anywhere . I could die now if I wanted . It 's limitless choice and no one cares .

ROBBIE: I 'm so fucking scared .
JIM: But you 're Alive ! It 's beautiful ! Fear , pain , lust , we 've got to know all our feelings before we can come out the other side free men . Do n't feel ashamed of yourselves , do n't let society destroy your reality . Our freedom 's the only thing worth dying for , it 's the only thing worth living for !
JOHN: I 'm not gon na make it man . I 'm scared Jim , I 'm still scared . Blindness is coming on .
JIM: Then use us John , use our strength , it 's us four now , a tribe of warriors , everything we have comes from the same source , the great Creator of Being . Trust him , trust us . Ride the snake . . . I promise you I will be with you till the end of time .

JIM: I do n't know I guess I should see a doctor or something maybe I should go to someone of the straight Jungian philosophy .
PAM: It happens to other guys too
JIM: It 's so scary up there . To be adored . Is n't that irony ? Teenage death girls want my dick a mere clown not my words . I 'll never wake up in a good mood again Lament for my cock , a tongue of knowledge deep in the feathered night , gives life , soar and crucify , I seek to know you
PAM: It 's not so complicated Jim , it 's just sex , y'know .

PAM: It 's the hours man , the pressure , everything 's like your last performance , you 're setting yourself up .
JIM: We were n't built to last .
PAM: Are n't you doing this for you , because you 're a poet , not a rock star . Ed Sullivan 's not a place for you .

JIM: we 're in Africa , we 're just animals I wan na stay inside you all night baby let 's fuck death away , now fuck death away
PAM: yes
JOURNALIST 1: What are your songs about Mr. Morrison ?
JIM: Uh love death travel revolt . We all write the songs , we 're interested in anything about disorder , chaos , especially activity which seems to have no meaning I think when you make peace with authority , you become authority .
JOURNALIST 1: Can you define that a little more ?
JIM: Yeah you can call us erotic politicians I guess .
JOURNALIST 2: Do you really consider yourself a shaman Mr. Morrison ?
JIM: a scapegoat maybe I take on the audiences ' fantasies , obeying their impulses . When the impulses are destructive , I 'm destructive . It 's kinda like sucking the puss out of a rattlesnake , something like that .
JOURNALIST 1: like a medicine man or witch doctor ?
RAY: Jim said to me once , the history of ock and roll 's like Greek drama o caveman stories . The audience comes to see ancient rituals in ancient caves . Their souls in jeopardy . They 're not watching any longer , they 're participating and everything 's in play , your life , your death
JOURNALIST 1: Is that why they scream so much ?
JOURNALIST 3: Mr. Morrison , how do you feel about eing called the `` ultimate barbie doll '' . On Jim a beat . A sickly smile spreads .
JIM: I guess when you say something like that , it 's a shortcut to thinking .
JOURNALIST 3: Then do you `` think '' about the dreadful eviews your new poetry book has gotten ?
JIM: I guess they did n't understand .
JOURNALIST 3: And it 's true you financed it 's publication ?
RAY: Have you bothered to read the poetry ma 'm ? You keep denying that anything good can come from L.A. , I mean is n't that kind of a provincial attitude ? That Bob Dylan 's the only poet cause he 's from the East Coast , but you wo n't even look past Jim 's goddamn looks at the words man !
JIM: Hey c'mon Ray , hate should be allowed .
JOURNALIST 1: but what really are your songs about Mr. Morrison ? You preach , `` saving the planet '' , `` making a new age '' but how does drinking , taking drugs , this boozy sort of apocalyptic stance at the world influence young people in a positive way ?
JIM: I like that `` boozy apocalyptic '' you 're a word man , but how does you newspaper influence young people to think about Vietnam ? Who 's sending the soldiers over there to die ? The establishment right ? Your newspaper ight ? That seems to me a lot more dangerous than the stuff we do .
JOURNALIST 3: Do you believe in drugs Mr. Morrison ?
JIM: Did you know Nietzsche said , `` all good consciousness , all evidence of truth comes only from the senses '' ? Hey you wan na arm wrestle ? Come on , you look pretty tough today . C'mon , I 'll take you all on .
JOURNALIST 3: And alcohol ? Is that considered part of the shaman 's wisdom ?
JIM: Part of the clown 's wisdom it 's kinda the American way . You know we spend more on alcohol and tobacco than on education . DOUBLE IMAGES on the DISSOLVES .
JOURNALIST 3: Are you by any chance in a trance now Mr. Morrison ?
JIM: Do you hurt ?
JOURNALIST 3: What ?
JIM: What hurts you the most ?
JOURNALIST 3: What are you doing ?
JIM: Uh got tired of the barbie doll look . It hurt .
JOURNALIST 3: Are you serious ?
JIM: About ? Y'know when people are joking , I find they are dead serious and when they 're dead serious , I find them funny .
JOURNALIST 4: What do your parents think about what you are doing ?
JIM: Actually , I do n't really remembe eing born . It musta happened during one of my blackouts .
JOURNALIST 4: But they must 've expressed some feeling ?
JIM: Well , to be honest they 're not living anymore so I do n't like to talk about that . Flashbulbs hitting his face at that moment .
JOURNALIST 4: Could you at least tell us how they died ?
JIM: Oh , it was a horrible car crash in the desert in the fifties , Arizona ran right into a truckload of Indians Navajos , they were lying out on the road , all bleeding , and I was with my Grandma and Grandad , we were banged up and all and I was looking at my Dad and he was lying there but his throat was severed and there was air coming out .
JOURNALIST 4: I 'm sorry .
JOURNALIST 2: I have the feeling I 'm being put on .
JIM: Y'all believe what you want to elieve , you will anyway but it does kinda show you what excites people ? Fear , pity , horror all those good things that count . It 's sorta I guess like being on the edge of an orgasm , y'know that mystery just before you come . When ? If ? Should I ? Will you die for me , eat me , this way , the end
PATRICIA: You want to do some more cocaine ? It 'll loosen you up .
JIM: Great ! A new thing .
PATRICIA: 14th Century . I practice the Craft .
JIM: The Craft ?
PATRICIA: I 'm a witch A white one .
JIM: Wow ! You Patricia ? Who would 've guessed ?
PATRICIA: The Kennealy 's were Celtic cheiftains and pre-Christian shamans when you Druid ancestors the Morrisons were a minor Scottish clan founded by a astard son of the king of Norway .
JIM: What ?
PATRICIA: It works you know . You drink blood the right time of the moon they used to dance in the forests naked . I think that 's what offended the Puritans and led to the Burnings . They were a sexual threat to thei male order like the Bacchae five days a year for Dionysus , they used to wander the hills in ancient Greece , the first witches , clans of wild women fucking , looting , eating animals aw , the wine in their blood running hot looking for Dionysus to tear him to pieces is n't that wild ?
JIM: Where do you get the blood ? Patricia laughs .
PATRICIA: Blood is the rose of mysterious union , symbol of potency now you .
JIM: No I do n't like cutting myself .
PATRICIA: Do n't be such a child ! If I do it , you have to do it .
DOORS SONG: Before you slip into unconsciousness I 'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss , another kiss
PATRICIA: Come on rock god , fuck me , fuck me good .
JIM: I 'm gon na burn you down .
PATRICIA: Come on Incants him to climax with CELTIC WORDS .
JIM: Nobody 'd ever look at you again 'cept me . I 'd scar you forever .
PATRICIA: Yeah YEAH !
JIM: AWRIGHT ! AWRIGHT !
DOORS SONG: The crystal ship is being filled A thousand girls , a thousand thrills A million ways to spend your time When we get back I 'll drop a line
GLORIA: Take off your shirt .
JIM: Mooooooo ! ! !
GLORIA: You remind me of a Russian peasant . I see you standing in a wheat field . The pride , the arrogance . You love to look at yourself do n't you . You love yourself . good big cat stalking
JIM: Where are the Doors .
GLORIA: Forget the Doors . It 's you they want , Jim . You 're the Doors .
JIM: We do everything together .

JIM: I am the snake and you are the lute
GLORIA: Exactly
DOORS SONG: People are strange when you 're a strange Faces look ugly when you 're alone Women seem wicked when you 're unwanted Streets are uneven when you 're down

University of Florida , Albuquerque , New Mexico , Arlington , Virginia , Washington , D.C . Brother , sister , it 's seven miles long baby it 's all in the `` The End '' , it 's so easy .

RAY: He could go all the way man ! In five years he could be in the White House . Another JFK .
JIM: I drink so I can talk to assholes . This includes me . Let 's just say I was testing the bounds of reality that's-all I was curious I kinda always preferred to be hated . Like Erich Von Stroheim in the movies the man you loved to hate it 's meant to be ironic , courage wants to laugh . Y'know it 's essentially a stupid situation . I go out on a stage and I howl for people . In me they see what they want to see some say the Lizard King , whateve that means , or some black-clad leathe demon whatever that means but eally I think of myself as a sensitive , intelligent human being ut with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most crucial moment a fake hero a joke the gods played on me it 's okay , I accept the joke and smile . Death old friend , death and my cock , I can forgive my injuries in the name of wisdom , luxury , romance . Words got me the wound and will get me well . All join now in lament of my cock , a tongue of knowledge in the feathered night . Boys get crazy in the head and suffer . I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence .

MORRISON: Well , didja get all that ?
GHOSTMAN: You done good , Jim , go now rest
ENGINEER: Yeah , I got it Jim .
JIM: Aw right . Let 's get some tacos !
PAM: Jim that you ?
JIM: They are waiting to take us into the severed garden do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death at a strange hour ? Unannounced unplanned for like a scaring overfriendly guest you 've brought to bed ? Death makes angels of us all ? And gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as aven 's claws
GHOST ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen , from Los Angeles California The Doors !
JIM: Well , I 'll tell you a story of whiskey , mystics and men And about the believers and how the whole thing began First there were women and children obeying the moon Then daylight brought wisdom and sickness too soon the moon is a dry blood beast We have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre to propagate ou lust for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets we live we die and death not ends it

WALTER NEFF: PHYLLIS DIETRICHSON BARTON KEYES LOLA DIETRICHSON MR. DIETRICHSON NINO ZACHETTI MR. NORTON MR. JACKSON SAM GORLOPIS
NIGHT WATCHMAN: Hello there , Mr. Neff . Neff walks in past him without answering .
NEFF: Late enough .
NIGHT WATCHMAN: You look kind of all in at that .
NEFF: I 'm fine . Let 's ride .
NIGHT WATCHMAN: How 's the insurance business , Mr. Neff ?
NEFF: Okay .
NIGHT WATCHMAN: They would n't ever sell me any . They say I 've got something loose in my heart . I say it 's rheumatism .
NEFF: Uh-huh .
NIGHT WATCHMAN: Twelve .
NEFF: Office memorandum , Walter Neff to Barton Keyes , Claims Manager . Los Angeles , July 16th , 1938 . Dear Keyes I suppose you 'll call this a confession when you hear it . I do n't like the word confession . I just want to set you right about one thing you could n't see , because it was smack up against your nose . You think you 're such a hot potato as a claims manager , such a wolf on a phoney claim . Well , maybe you are , Keyes , ut let 's take a look at this Dietrichson claim , Accident and Double Indemnity . You were pretty good in there for a while , all right . You said it was n't an accident . Check . You said it was n't suicide . Check . You said it was murder . Check and double check . You thought you had it cold , all wrapped up in tissue paper , with pink ribbons around it . It was perfect , except that it was n't , ecause you made a mistake , just one tiny little mistake . When it came to picking the killer , you picked the wrong guy , if you know what I mean . Want to know who killed Dietrichson ? Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours , Keyes . I killed Dietrichson . Me , Walter Neff , insurance agent , 35 years old , unmarried , no visible scars Until a little while ago , that is . Yes , I killed him . I killed him fo money and a woman and I did n't get the money and I did n't get the woman . Pretty , is n't it ?
NEFF'S VOICE: It was mid-afternoon , and it 's funny , I can still remember the smell of honeysuckle all along that block . I felt like a million . There was no way in all this world I could have known that murder sometimes can smell like honeysuckle
NEFF: Mr. Dietrichson in ?
MAID: Who wants to see him ?
NEFF: The name is Neff . Walter Neff .
MAID: If you 're selling something
NEFF: Look , it 's Mr. Dietrichson I 'd like to talk to , and it 's not magazine subscriptions . He pushes past her into the house .
MAID: Listen , Mr. Dietrichson 's not in .
NEFF: How soon do you expect him ?
MAID: He 'll be home when he gets here , if that 's any help to you .
VOICE: What is it , Nettie ? Who is it ? Neff looks up .
MAID'S VOICE: It 's for Mr. Dietrichson .
PHYLLIS: I 'm Mrs. Dietrichson . What is it ?
NEFF: How do you do , Mrs. Dietrichson . I 'm Walter Neff , Pacific All-Risk .
PHYLLIS: Pacific all-what ?
NEFF: Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company . It 's about some renewals on the automobiles , Mrs. Dietrichson . I 've een trying to contact your husband for the past two weeks . He 's neve at his office .
PHYLLIS: Is there anything I can do ?
NEFF: The insurance ran out on the fifteenth . I 'd hate to think of you getting a smashed fender or something while you 're not fully covered .
PHYLLIS: Perhaps I know what you mean , Mr. Neff . I 've just been taking a sun ath .
NEFF: No pigeons around , I hope About those policies , Mrs. Dietrichson I hate to take up your time
PHYLLIS: That 's all right . If you can wait till I put something on , I 'll be ight down . Nettie , show Mr. Neff into the living room .
NEFF: Where would the living room be ?
MAID: In there , but they keep the liquo locked up .
NEFF: That 's okay . I always carry my own keys .
NEFF'S VOICE: The living room was still stuffy from last night 's cigars . The windows were closed and the sunshine coming in through the Venetian blinds showed up the dust in the air . The furniture was kind of corny and old-fashioned , ut it had a comfortable look , as if people really sat in it . On the piano , in couple of fancy frames , were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola , his daughte y his first wife They had a bowl of those little red goldfish on the table behind the davenport , but , to tell you the truth , Keyes , I was n't a whole lot interested in goldfish ight then , nor in auto renewals , nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his daughter Lola . I was thinking about that dame upstairs , and the way she had looked at me , and I wanted to see her again , close , without that silly staircase between us .
PHYLLIS' VOICE: I was n't long , was I ?
NEFF'S VOICE: Not at all , Mrs. Dietrichson .
PHYLLIS: I hope I 've got my face on straight .
NEFF: It 's perfect for my money .
PHYLLIS: Wo n't you sit down , Mr. Neff is the name , is n't it ?
NEFF: With two f 's , like in Philadelphia . If you know the story .
PHYLLIS: What story ?
NEFF: The Philadelphia story . What are we talking about ?
PHYLLIS: About the insurance . My husband neve tells me anything .
NEFF: It 's on your two cars , the La Salle and the Plymouth .
PHYLLIS: I guess he 's been too busy down at Long Beach in the oil fields .
NEFF: Could I catch him home some evening for a few minutes ?
PHYLLIS: I suppose so . But he 's never home much before eight .
NEFF: That would be fine with me .
PHYLLIS: You 're not connected with the Automobile Club , are you ?
NEFF: No , the All-Risk , Mrs. Dietrichson . Why ?
PHYLLIS: Somebody from the Automobile Clu has been trying to get him . Do they have a better rate ?
NEFF: If your husband 's a member .
PHYLLIS: No , he is n't .
NEFF: Well , he 'd have to join the club and pay a membership fee to start with . The Automobile Club is fine . I neve knock the other fellow 's merchandise , Mrs. Dietrichson , but I can do just as well for you . I have a very attractive policy here . It would n't take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband . He consults the policies he is holding .
PHYLLIS: You 're a smart insurance man , are n't you , Mr. Neff ?
NEFF: I 've had eleven years of it .
PHYLLIS: Doing pretty well ?
NEFF: It 's a living .
PHYLLIS: You handle just automobile insurance , or all kinds ?
NEFF: All kinds . Fire , earthquake , theft , public liability , group insurance , industrial stuff and so on right down the line .
PHYLLIS: Accident insurance ?
NEFF: Accident insurance ? Sure , Mrs. Dietrichson . His eyes fall on the anklet again .
PHYLLIS: Just my name .
NEFF: As for instance ?
PHYLLIS: Phyllis .
NEFF: Phyllis . I think I like that .
PHYLLIS: But you 're not sure ?
NEFF: I 'd have to drive it around the block a couple of times .
PHYLLIS: Mr. Neff , why do n't you drop by tomorrow evening about eight-thirty . He 'll be in then .
NEFF: Who ?
PHYLLIS: My husband . You were anxious to talk to him were n't you ?
NEFF: Sure , only I 'm getting over it a little . If you know what I mean .
PHYLLIS: There 's a speed limit in this state , Mr. Neff . Forty-five miles an hour .
NEFF: How fast was I going , officer ?
PHYLLIS: I 'd say about ninety .
NEFF: Suppose you get down off you motorcycle and give me a ticket .
PHYLLIS: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time .
NEFF: Suppose it does n't take .
PHYLLIS: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles .
NEFF: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder .
PHYLLIS: Suppose you try putting it on my husband 's shoulder .
NEFF: That tears it . Neff takes his hat and briefcase .
PHYLLIS: That 's what I suggested . They both move toward the archway .
NEFF: Will you be here , too ?
PHYLLIS: I guess so . I usually am .
NEFF: Same chair , same perfume , same anklet ?
PHYLLIS: I wonder if I know what you mean .
NEFF: I wonder if you wonder . He walks out .
NEFF'S VOICE: She liked me . I could feel that . The way you feel when the cards are
SECRETARY: Oh , Mr. Neff , Mr. Keyes wants to see you . He 's been yelling for you all afternoon .
NEFF: Is he sore , or just frothing at the mouth a little ? Here , park these fo me , sweetheart .
KEYES: Wise up , Gorlopis . You 're not kidding anybody with that line of bull . You 're in a jam and you know it .
GORLOPIS: Sez you . All I want is my money .
KEYES: Sez you . All you 're gon na get is the cops . He sees Neff standing inside the door .
NEFF: Sure , I know Mr. Gorlopis . Wrote a policy on his truck . How are you , Mr. Gorlopis ?
GORLOPIS: I ai n't so good . My truck burned down . He looks cautiously sideways at Keyes .
KEYES: Yeah , he just planted his big foot on the starter and the whole thing lazed up in his face .
GORLOPIS: Yes , sir .
KEYES: And did n't even singe his eyebrows .
GORLOPIS: No sir . Look , mister . I got twenty- six hundred bucks tied up in that truck . I 'm insured with this company and I want my money .
KEYES: You got a wife , Gorlopis ?
GORLOPIS: Sure I got a wife .
KEYES: You got kids ?
GORLOPIS: Two kids .
KEYES: What you got for dinner tonight ?
GORLOPIS: We got meat loaf .
KEYES: How do you make your meat loaf , Gorlopis ?
GORLOPIS: Veal and pork and bread and garlic . Greek style .
KEYES: How much garlic ?
GORLOPIS: Lotsa garlic , Mr. Keyes .
KEYES: Okay , Gorlopis . Now listen here . Let 's say you just came up here to tell me how to make meat loaf . That 's all , understand ? Because if you came up here to claim on that truck , I 'd have to turn you over to the law , Gorlopis , and they 'd put you in jail . No wife . No kids
GORLOPIS: What for ?
KEYES: And no meat loaf , Gorlopis !
GORLOPIS: I did n't do nothin ' .
KEYES: No ? Look , Gorlopis . Every month hundreds of claims come to this desk . Some of them are phonies , and I know which ones . How do I know , Gorlopis ? Because my little man tells me .
GORLOPIS: What little man ?
KEYES: The little man in here . He pounds the pit of his stomach .
GORLOPIS: What shavings ?
KEYES: The ones you soaked with kerosene and dropped a match on . Gorlopis cringes under the impact .
GORLOPIS: Look , Mr. Keyes , I 'm just a poo guy . Maybe I made a mistake .
KEYES: That 's one way of putting it .
GORLOPIS: I ai n't feelin ' so good , Mr. Keyes .
KEYES: Sign this and you 'll feel fine .
GORLOPIS: But I ai n't got no more truck .
KEYES: Goodbye , Gorlopis .
GORLOPIS: Goodbye , Mr. Keyes .
KEYES: What 's the matter , Gorlopis ? Do n't you know how to open the door ? Just put your hand on the knob , turn it to the right , pull it toward you
GORLOPIS: Like this , Mr. Keyes ?
KEYES: That 's the boy . Now the same thing from the outside .
GORLOPIS: Thank you , Mr. Keyes .
KEYES: What kind of an outfit is this anyway ? Are we an insurance company , or a unch of dimwitted amateurs , writing a policy on a mugg like that ?
NEFF: Wait a minute , Keyes . I do n't rate this beef . I clipped a note to that Gorlopis application to have him thoroughly investigated before we accepted the risk .
KEYES: I know you did , Walter . I 'm not eefing at you . It 's the company . The way they do things . The way they do n't do things . The way they 'll write anything just to get it down on the sales sheet . And I 'm the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims so they wo n't throw more money out of the window than they take in at the door .
NEFF: Okay , turn the record over and let 's hear the other side .
KEYES: I get darn sick of picking up afte a gang of fast-talking salesmen dum enough to sell life insurance to a guy that sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes . I 've had twenty- six years of that , Walter , and I
NEFF: And you loved every minute of it , Keyes . You love it , only you worry about it too much , you and your little man . You 're so darn conscientious you 're driving yourself crazy . You would n't even say today is Tuesday without you looked at the calendar , and then you would check if it was this year 's or last year 's calendar , and then you would find out what company printed the calendar , then find out if their calendar checks with the World Almanac 's calendar .
KEYES: That 's enough from you , Walter . Get out of here before I throw my desk at you .
NEFF: I love you , too . He walks out , still grinning .
NEFF'S VOICE: I really did , too , you old crab , always yelling your fat head off , always sore at everyone . But behind the cigar ashes on your vest I kind of knew you had a heart as big as a house Back in my office there was a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson about the renewals . She did n't want me to come tomorrow evening . She wanted me to come Thursday afternoon at three-thirty instead . I had a lot of stuff lined up for that Thursday afternoon , including a trip down to Santa Monica to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance . But I kept thinking about Phyllis Dietrichson and the way that anklet of hers cut into her leg .
PHYLLIS: Hello , Mr. Neff . He stands there with a little smile .
NEFF: I 'm considering it . He comes in .
PHYLLIS: I hope you did n't mind my changing the appointment . Last night was n't so convenient .
NEFF: That 's okay . I was working on my stamp collection . She leads him toward living room .
PHYLLIS: I was just fixing some iced tea . Would you like a glass ?
NEFF: Unless you have a bottle of bee that 's not working .
PHYLLIS: There might be some . I never know what 's in the ice box . Nettie ! She pours herself a glass of tea .
NEFF: You did ?
PHYLLIS: Yes . He 'll renew with you he told me . In fact , I thought he 'd be here this afternoon .
NEFF: But he 's not ?
PHYLLIS: No .
NEFF: That 's terrible .
PHYLLIS: Nettie ! Nettie ! Oh , I forgot , it 's the maid 's day off .
NEFF: Do n't bother , Mrs. Dietrichson . I 'd like some iced tea very much .
PHYLLIS: Lemon ? Sugar ?
NEFF: Fix it your way .
PHYLLIS: Fresh .
NEFF: I used to peddle vacuum cleaners . Not much money but you learn a lot about life .
PHYLLIS: I did n't think you 'd learned it from a correspondence course .
NEFF: Where did you pick up this tea drinking ? You 're not English , are you ?
PHYLLIS: No . Californian . Born right here in Los Angeles .
NEFF: They say native Californians all come from Iowa .
PHYLLIS: I wanted to ask you something , Mr. Neff .
NEFF: Make it Walter .
PHYLLIS: Walter .
NEFF: Right .
PHYLLIS: Tell me , Walter , on this insurance how much commission do you make ?
NEFF: Twenty percent . Why ?
PHYLLIS: I thought maybe I could throw a little more business your way .
NEFF: I can always use it .
PHYLLIS: I was thinking about my husband . I worry a lot about him , down in those oil fields . It 's very dangerous .
NEFF: Not for an executive , is it ?
PHYLLIS: He does n't just sit behind a desk . He 's right down there with the drilling crews . It 's got me worried sick .
NEFF: You mean a crown block might fall on him some rainy night ?
PHYLLIS: Please do n't talk like that .
NEFF: But that 's the idea .
PHYLLIS: The other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman . He 's in the hospital with a broken back .
NEFF: Bad .
PHYLLIS: It 's got me jittery just thinking about it . Suppose something like that happened to my husband ?
NEFF: It could .
PHYLLIS: Do n't you think he ought to have accident insurance ?
NEFF: Uh huh .
PHYLLIS: What kind of insurance could he have ?
NEFF: Enough to cover doctors ' and hospital ills . Say a hundred and twenty-five a week cash benefit . And he 'd rate around fifty thousand capital sum .
PHYLLIS: Capital sum ? What 's that ?
NEFF: That 's if he got killed . Maybe I should n't have said that .
PHYLLIS: I suppose you have to think of everything in your business .
NEFF: Mr. Dietrichson would understand . I 'm sure I could sell him on the idea of some accident protection . Why do n't I talk to him about it .
PHYLLIS: You could try . But he 's pretty tough going .
NEFF: They 're all tough at first .
PHYLLIS: He 's got a lot on his mind . He does n't want to listen to anything except maybe a baseball game on the radio . Sometimes we sit all evening without saying a word to each other .
NEFF: Sounds pretty dull . Phyllis shrugs .
PHYLLIS: So I just sit and knit .
NEFF: Is that what you married him for ?
PHYLLIS: Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold up the wool .
NEFF: Anytime his thumbs get tired
PHYLLIS: I want to ask you something , Mr. Neff . Could I get an accident policy for him without bothering him at all ?
NEFF: How 's that again .
PHYLLIS: That would make it easier for you , too . You would n't even have to talk to him . I have a little allowance of my own . I could pay for it and he need n't know anything about it .
NEFF: Wait a minute . Why should n't he know ?
PHYLLIS: Because I know he does n't want accident insurance . He 's superstitious about it .
NEFF: A lot of people are . Funny , is n't it ?
PHYLLIS: If there was a way to get it like that , all the worry would be over . You see what I mean , Walter ?
NEFF: Sure . I 've got good eyesight . You want him to have the policy without him knowing it . And that means without the insurance company knowing that he does n't know . That 's the set-up , is n't it ?
PHYLLIS: Is there anything wrong with it ?
NEFF: I think it 's lovely . And then , some dark wet night , if that crown block fell on him
PHYLLIS: What crown block ?
NEFF: Only sometimes they have to have a little help . They ca n't quite make it on their own .
PHYLLIS: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
NEFF: Of course , it does n't have to be a crown block . It can be a car backing over him , or he can fall out of an upstairs window . Any little thing like that , as long as it 's a morgue job .
PHYLLIS: Are you crazy ?
NEFF: Not that crazy . Goodbye , Mrs. Dietrichson . He picks up his hat .
PHYLLIS: What 's the matter ?
NEFF: Look , baby , you ca n't get away with it .
PHYLLIS: Get away with what ?
NEFF: You want to knock him off , do n't you , baby .
PHYLLIS: That 's a horrible thing to say !
NEFF: Who 'd you think I was , anyway ? A guy that walks into a good-looking dame 's front parlor and says `` Good afternoon , I sell accident insurance on husbands . You got one that 's been around too long ? Somebody you 'd like to turn into a little hard cash ? Just give me a smile and I 'll help you collect . '' Boy , what a dope I must look to you !
PHYLLIS: I think you 're rotten .
NEFF: I think you 're swell . So long as I 'm not your husband .
PHYLLIS: Get out of here .
NEFF: You bet I will . You bet I 'll get out of here , baby . But quick . He goes out . She looks after him .
NEFF'S VOICE: So I let her have it , straight between the eyes . She did n't fool me for a minute , not this time . I knew I had hold of a redhot poker and the time to drop it was before it burned my hand off . I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer , the one I had wanted all along , only I wanted it worse now , to get rid of the sou taste of her iced tea , and everything that went with it . I did n't want to go back to the office , so I dropped y a bowling alley at Third and Western and rolled a few lines to get my mind thinking about something else for a while .
PHYLLIS: Hello . Neff just looks at her .
NEFF: Did I ? He looks down at her hands .
PHYLLIS: Do n't you want me to bring it in ?
NEFF: Sure . Put it on the chair . She comes in . He closes the door .
PHYLLIS: It 's in the phone book . Neff switches on the standing lamp .
NEFF: So it is . Peel off your coat and sit down . She starts to take off her coat .
PHYLLIS: Long Beach . They 're spudding in a new well . He phoned he 'd be late . About nine-thirty .
NEFF: I knew you would n't leave it like that .
PHYLLIS: Like what ?
NEFF: Like it was this afternoon .
PHYLLIS: I must have said something that gave you a terribly wrong impression . You must surely see that . You must neve think anything like that about me , Walter .
NEFF: Okay .
PHYLLIS: It 's not okay . Not if you do n't elieve me .
NEFF: What do you want me to do ?
PHYLLIS: I want you to be nice to me . Like the first time you came to the house .
NEFF: It ca n't be like the first time . Something has happened .
PHYLLIS: I know it has . It 's happened to us .
NEFF: That 's what I mean .
PHYLLIS: I feel as if he was watching me . Not that he cares about me . Not any more . But he keeps me on a leash . So tight I ca n't breathe . I 'm scared .
NEFF: What of ? He 's in Long Beach , is n't he ?
PHYLLIS: I ought n't to have come .
NEFF: Maybe you ought n't .
PHYLLIS: You want me to go ?
NEFF: If you want to .
PHYLLIS: Right now ?
NEFF: Sure . Right now .
PHYLLIS: Do what ?
NEFF: Kill him .
PHYLLIS: Walter , for the last time
NEFF: I 'm crazy about you , baby .
PHYLLIS: I 'm crazy about you , Walter .
NEFF: That perfume on your hair . What 's the name of it ?
PHYLLIS: Something French . I bought it down at Ensenada .
NEFF: We ought to have some of that pink wine to go with it . The kind that ubbles . But all I have is bourbon .
PHYLLIS: Bourbon is fine , Walter . He lets her go and moves toward the dinette .
NEFF: Soda ?
PHYLLIS: Plain water , please .
NEFF: Get a couple of glasses , will you .
PHYLLIS: Who did n't ?
NEFF: His wife .
PHYLLIS: Perhaps it was worth it to her . Neff hands her a glass .
NEFF: See if you can carry this as far as the living room . They move back toward the living room .
PHYLLIS: It 's nice here , Walter . Who takes care of it for you ?
NEFF: A colored woman comes in twice a week .
PHYLLIS: You get your own breakfast ?
NEFF: Once in a while I squeeze a grapefruit . The rest I get at the corner drugstore .
PHYLLIS: It sounds wonderful . Just strangers eside you . You do n't know them . You do n't hate them . You do n't have to sit across the table and smile at him and that daughter of his every morning of your life .
NEFF: What daughter ? Oh , that little girl on the piano .
PHYLLIS: Yes . Lola . She lives with us . He thinks a lot more of her than he does of me .
NEFF: Ever think of a divorce ?
PHYLLIS: He would n't give me a divorce .
NEFF: I suppose because it would cost him money .
PHYLLIS: He has n't got any money . Not since he went into the oil business .
NEFF: But he had when you married him ?
PHYLLIS: Yes , he had . And I wanted a home . Why not ? But that was n't the only eason . I was his wife 's nurse . She was sick for a long time . When she died , he was all broken up . I pitied him so .
NEFF: And now you hate him .
PHYLLIS: Yes , Walter . He 's so mean to me . Every-time I buy a dress or a pai of shoes he yells his head off . He wo n't let me go anywhere . He keeps me shut up . He 's always been mean to me . Even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his . That Lola .
NEFF: Nothing for you at all , huh ?
PHYLLIS: No . And nothing is just what I 'm worth to him .
NEFF: So you lie awake in the dark and listen to him snore and get ideas .
PHYLLIS: Walter , I do n't want to kill him . I never did . Not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face .
NEFF: Only sometimes you wish he was dead .
PHYLLIS: Perhaps I do .
NEFF: And you wish it was an accident , and you had that policy . For fifty thousand dollars . Is that it ?
PHYLLIS: Perhaps that too . She takes a long drink .
NEFF: I 'll tell you what it would be like , if you had that accident policy , and tried to pull a monoxide job . We have a guy in our office named Keyes . For him a set-up like that would be just like a slice of rare roast beef . In three minutes he 'd know it was n't an accident . In ten minutes you 'd be sitting under the hot lights . In half an hour you 'd be signing you name to a confession .
PHYLLIS: But Walter , I did n't do it . I 'm not going to do it .
NEFF: Not if there 's an insurance company in the picture , baby . So long as you 're honest they 'll pay you with a smile , but you just try to pull something like that and you 'll find out . They know more tricks than a carload of monkeys . And if there 's a death mixed up in it , you have n't got a prayer . They 'll hang you as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar , aby .
PHYLLIS: I 've got to go now , Walter .
NEFF: Sure I believe you .
PHYLLIS: I ca n't stand it anymore . What if they did hang me ?
NEFF: You 're not going to hang , baby .
PHYLLIS: It 's better than going on this way .
NEFF: you 're not going to hang , baby . Not ever . Because you 're going to do it the smart way . Because I 'm going to help you .
PHYLLIS: You !
NEFF: Me .
PHYLLIS: Do you know what you 're saying ?
NEFF: Sure I know what I 'm saying . He gets up and grips her arm .
PHYLLIS: Walter , you 're hurting me .
NEFF: There is n't going to be any slip up . Nothing sloppy . Nothing weak . It 's got to be perfect . He kisses her .
PHYLLIS: Straight down the line .
NEFF: The first thing we had to do was fix him up with that accident policy . I knew he would n't buy , but all I wanted was his signature on an application . So I had to make him sign without his knowing what he was signing . And I wanted a witness other than Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk . I was trying to think with your brains , Keyes . I wanted all the answers ready for all the questions you were going to spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead .
DIETRICHSON: I know all about that . The next thing you 'll tell me I need earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance .
PHYLLIS: If we bought all the insurance they can think up , we 'd stay broke paying for it , would n't we , honey ?
DIETRICHSON: What keeps us broke is you going out and buying five hats at a crack . Who needs a hat in California ?
NEFF: I always say insurance is a lot like a hot water bottle . It looks kind of useless and silly hanging on the hook , but when you get that stomach ache in the middle of the night , it comes in mighty handy .
DIETRICHSON: Now you want to sell me a hot wate ottle .
NEFF: Dollar for dollar , accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can uy , Mr. Dietrichson .
DIETRICHSON: Maybe some other time , Mr. Neff . I had a tough day .
NEFF: Just as you say , Mr. Dietrichson .
DIETRICHSON: Suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight .
NEFF: Sure . All we need on that is for you to sign an application for renewal .
LOLA: Phyllis , do you mind if we do n't finish this game ? It bores me stiff .
PHYLLIS: Got some thing better to do ?
LOLA: Yes , I have . She gets up .
DIETRICHSON: Run along where ? Who with ?
LOLA: Just Anne . We 're going roller skating .
DIETRICHSON: Anne who ?
LOLA: Anne Matthews .
PHYLLIS: It 's not that Nino Zachetti again ?
DIETRICHSON: It better not be that Zachetti guy . If I ever catch you with that -
LOLA: It 's Anne Matthews , I told you . I also told you we 're going rolle skating . I 'm meeting her at the corne of Vermont and Franklin the north- west corner , in case you 're interested . And I 'm late already . I hope that is all clear . Good night , Father . Good night , Phyllis . She starts to go .
NEFF: Good night , Miss Dietrichson .
LOLA: Oh , I 'm sorry . Good night , Mr .
NEFF: Neff .
LOLA: Good night , Mr. Neff .
PHYLLIS: Now you 're not going to take my ca again .
LOLA: No thanks . I 'd rather be dead . She goes out through the archway .
DIETRICHSON: A great little fighter for her weight .
NEFF: This is where you sign , Mr. Dietrichson .
DIETRICHSON: Sign what ?
NEFF: The applications for your auto enewals . So you 'll be protected until the new policies are issued .
DIETRICHSON: When will that be ?
NEFF: In about a week .
DIETRICHSON: Just so I 'm covered when I drive up North . Neff takes out his fountain pen .
NEFF: San Francisco , Mr. Dietrichson ?
DIETRICHSON: Palo Alto .
PHYLLIS: He was a Stanford man , Mr. Neff . And he still goes to his class reunion every year .
DIETRICHSON: What 's wrong with that ? Ca n't I have a little fun even once a year ?
NEFF: Great football school , Stanford . Did you play football , Mr. Dietrichson ?
DIETRICHSON: Left guard . Almost made the varsity , too .
NEFF: On that bottom line , Mr. Dietrichson .
DIETRICHSON: Sign twice , huh ?
NEFF: One is the agent 's copy . I need it for my files .
DIETRICHSON: Files . Duplicates . Triplicates .
NEFF: No hurry about the check , Mr. Dietrichson . I can pick it up at your office some morning .
DIETRICHSON: How much you taking me for ?
NEFF: One forty-seven fifty , Mr. Dietrichson .
PHYLLIS: I guess that 's enough insurance fo one evening , Mr. Neff .
DIETRICHSON: Plenty .
NEFF: Good night , Mr. Dietrichson . Good night , Mrs. Dietrichson .
DIETRICHSON: Bring me some soda when you come up , Phyllis . Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway .
PHYLLIS: I think you left your hat in the hall .
NEFF: Fine .
PHYLLIS: He signed it , did n't he ?
NEFF: Sure he signed it . You saw him .
PHYLLIS: End of the month .
NEFF: He drives , huh ?
PHYLLIS: He always drives .
NEFF: Not this time . You 're going to make him take the train .
PHYLLIS: Why ?
NEFF: Because it 's all worked out for a train .
PHYLLIS: It 's all right . Go on , Walter .
NEFF: Look , baby . There 's a clause in every accident policy , a little something called double indemnity . The insurance companies put it in as a sort of come-on for the customers . It means they pay double on certain accidents . The kind that almost never happen . Like for instance if a guy got killed on a train , they 'd pay a hundred thousand instead of fifty .
PHYLLIS: I see .
NEFF: We 're hitting it for the limit , baby . That 's why it 's got to be a train .
PHYLLIS: It 's going to be a train , Walter . Just the way you say . Straight down the line .
LOLA: Hello , Mr. Neff . It 's me .
NEFF: Something the matter ?
LOLA: I 've been waiting for you .
NEFF: For me ? What for ?
LOLA: I thought you could let me ride with you , if you 're going my way . Neff does n't like the idea very much .
NEFF: Which way would that be ?
LOLA: Down the hill . Down Vermont .
NEFF: Oh , sure . Vermont and Franklin . North- west corner , was n't it ? Be glad to , Miss Dietrichson . Neff gets into the car .
LOLA: I can take it or leave it .
NEFF: Only tonight you 're leaving it ? This is an embarrassing moment for Lola .
LOLA: Yes , I am . You see , Mr. Neff , I 'm having a very tough time at home . My father does n't understand me and Phyllis hates me .
NEFF: That does sound tough , all right .
LOLA: That 's why I have to lie sometimes .
NEFF: You mean it 's not Vermont and Franklin .
LOLA: It 's Vermont and Franklin all right . Only it 's not Anne Matthews . It 's Nino Zachetti . You wo n't tell on me , will you ?
NEFF: I 'd have to think it over .
LOLA: Nino 's not what my father says at all . He just had bad luck . He was doing pre-med at U.S.C . and working nights as an usher in a theate downtown . He got behind in his credits and flunked out . Then he lost his job for talking back . He 's so hot- headed .
NEFF: That comes expensive , does n't it ?
LOLA: I guess my father thinks nobody 's good enough for his daughter except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil . Would you like a stick of gum ?
NEFF: Never use it , thanks . Lola puts a stick of gum in her mouth .
LOLA: I ca n't give Nino up . I wish fathe could see it my way .
NEFF: It 'll straighten out all right , Miss Dietrichson .
LOLA: I suppose it will sometime . This is the corner right here , Mr. Neff . Neff brings the car to a stop by the curb .
LOLA'S VOICE: Over here , Nino . Zachetti walks towards the car .
LOLA: This is Mr. Neff , Nino .
NEFF: Hello , Nino .
ZACHETTI: The name is Zachetti .
LOLA: Nino . Please . Mr. Neff gave me a ide from the house . I told him all about us .
ZACHETTI: Why does he have to get told about us ?
LOLA: We do n't have to worry about Mr. Neff , Nino .
ZACHETTI: I 'm not doing any worrying . Just do n't you broadcast so much .
LOLA: What 's the matter with you , Nino ? He 's a friend .
ZACHETTI: I do n't have any friends . And if I did , I like to pick them myself .
NEFF: Look , sonny , she needed the ride and I brought her along . Is that anything to get tough about ?
ZACHETTI: All right , Lola , make up your mind . Are you coming or are n't you ?
LOLA: Of course I 'm coming . Do n't mind him , Mr. Neff . Lola steps out of the car .
NEFF'S VOICE: She was a nice kid and maybe he was a little better than he sounded . I kind of hoped so for her sake , but ight then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all , with that briefcase right behind my head and her father 's application in it . Besides , I had other problems to work out . There were plans to make , and Phyllis had to be in on them
PHYLLIS: Walter .
NEFF: Not so loud .
PHYLLIS: I wanted to talk to you , Walter . Ever since yesterday .
NEFF: Let me talk first . It 's all set . The accident policy came through . I 've got it in my pocket . I got his check too . I saw him down in the oil fields . He thought he was paying for the auto insurance . The check 's just made out to the company . It could be for anything . But you have to send a check for the auto insurance , see . It 's all right that way , because one of the cars is yours .
PHYLLIS: But listen , Walter -
NEFF: Quick , open your bag .
PHYLLIS: Yes . We both have keys .
NEFF: Fine . But do n't put the policy in there yet . I 'll tell you when . And listen , you never touched it or even saw it , understand ?
PHYLLIS: I 'm not a fool .
NEFF: Okay . When is he taking the train ?
PHYLLIS: Walter , that 's just it . He is n't going .
NEFF: What ?
PHYLLIS: That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . The trip is off .
NEFF: What 's happened ?
WOMAN: Mister , could you reach me that can of coffee ? That one up there .
NEFF: This one ?
WOMAN: I do n't see why they always have to put what I want on the top shelf .
NEFF: Go ahead . I 'm listening .
PHYLLIS: He had a fall down at the well . He oke his leg . It 's in a cast .
NEFF: That knocks it on the head all right .
PHYLLIS: What do we do , Walter ?
NEFF: Nothing . Just wait .
PHYLLIS: Wait for what ?
NEFF: Until he can take a train . I told you it 's got to be a train .
PHYLLIS: We ca n't wait . I ca n't go on like this .
NEFF: We 're not going to grab a hammer and do it quick , just to get it ove with .
PHYLLIS: There are other ways .
NEFF: Only we 're not going to do it othe ways .
PHYLLIS: But we ca n't leave it like this . What do you think would happen if he found out about this accident policy ?
NEFF: Plenty . But not as bad as sitting in that death-house .
PHYLLIS: Do n't ever talk like that , Walter .
NEFF: Just do n't let 's start losing ou heads .
PHYLLIS: It 's not our heads . It 's our nerve we 're losing .
NEFF: We 're going to do it right . That 's all I said .
PHYLLIS: Walter maybe it 's my nerves . It 's the waiting that gets me .
NEFF: It 's getting me just as bad , baby . But we 've got to wait .
PHYLLIS: Maybe we have , Walter . Only it 's so tough without you . It 's like a wall etween us . Neff looks at his watch .
NEFF: Good-bye baby . I 'm thinking of you every minute . He goes off . She stares after him .
NEFF'S VOICE: After that a full week went by and I did n't see her once . I tried to keep my mind off her and off the whole idea . I kept telling myself that maybe those fates they say watch over you had gotten together and oken his leg to give me a way out . Then it was the fifteenth of June . You may remember that date , Keyes . I do too , only for a very different eason . You came into my office around three in the afternoon Keyes enters with some papers in his hand .
NEFF: Hello , Keyes .
KEYES: I just came from Norton 's office . The semi-annual sales records are out . You 're high man , Walter . That 's twice in a row . Congratulations .
NEFF: Thanks . How would you like a cheap drink ?
KEYES: How would you like a fifty dolla cut in salary ?
NEFF: How would I Do I laugh now , o wait until it gets funny ?
KEYES: I 'm serious , Walter . I 've been talking to Norton . There 's too much stuff piling up on my desk . Too much pressure on my nerves . I spend half the night walking up and down in my ed . I 've got to have an assistant . I thought that you
NEFF: Me ? Why pick on me ?
KEYES: Because I 've got a crazy idea you might be good at the job .
NEFF: That 's crazy all right . I 'm a salesman .
KEYES: Yeah . A peddler , a glad-hander , a ack-slapper . You 're too good to be a salesman .
NEFF: Nobody 's too good to be a salesman .
KEYES: Phooey . All you guys do is ring door- ells and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk . What 's bothering you is that fifty buck cut , is n't it ?
NEFF: That 'd bother anybody .
KEYES: Look , Walter . The job I 'm talking about takes brains and integrity . It takes more guts than there is in fifty salesman . It 's the hottest jo in the business .
NEFF: It 's still a desk job . I do n't want a desk job .
KEYES: A desk job . Is that all you can see in it ? Just a hard chair to park your pants on from nine to five . Just a pile of papers to shuffle around , and five sharp pencils and a scratch pad to make figures on , with maybe a little doodling on the side . That 's not the way I see it , Walter . To me a claims man is a surgeon , and that desk is an operating table , and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels . And those papers are not just forms and statistics and claims for compensation . They 're alive , they 're packed with drama , with twisted hopes and crooked dreams . A claims man , Walter , is a doctor and a blood-hound and a cop and a judge and a jury and a father confessor , all in one .
NEFF: Walter Neff speaking .
PHYLLIS: I had to call you , Walter . It 's terribly urgent . Are you with somebody ?
NEFF: Of course I am . Ca n't I call you ack Margie ?
PHYLLIS: Walter , I 've only got a minute . It ca n't wait . Listen . He 's going tonight . On the train . Are you listening , Walter ? Walter !
NEFF: I 'm listening . Only make it short Margie .
PHYLLIS: He 's on crutches . The doctor says he can go if he 's careful . The change will do him good . It 's wonderful , Walter . Just the way you wanted it . Only with the crutches it 's ever so much better , is n't it ?
NEFF: One hundred percent better . Hold the line a minute .
KEYES: I 'll wait . Only tell Margie not to take all day .
NEFF: Go ahead .
PHYLLIS: It 's the ten-fifteen from Glendale . I 'm driving him . Is it still that same dark street ?
NEFF: Yeah sure .
PHYLLIS: The signal is three honks on the horn . Is there anything else ?
NEFF: What color did you pick out ?
PHYLLIS: Color ? Oh , sure . The blue suit , Walter . Navy blue . And the cast on his left leg .
NEFF: Navy blue . I like that fine .
PHYLLIS: This is it , Walter . I 'm shaking like a leaf . But it 's straight down the line now for both of us . I love you , Walter . Goodbye .
NEFF: So long , Margie .
KEYES: What 's the matter ? The dames chasing you again ? Or still ? Or is it none of my business ?
NEFF: If I told you it was a customer
KEYES: Margie ! I bet she drinks from the ottle . Why do n't you settle down and get married , Walter ?
NEFF: Why do n't you , for instance ?
KEYES: I almost did , once . A long time ago . Neff gets up from his desk .
NEFF: Look , Keyes , I 've got a prospect to call on . Keyes drives right ahead .
KEYES: We even had the church all picked out , the dame and I . She had a white satin dress with flounces on it . And I was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring . Then suddenly that little man in here started working on me . He punches his stomach with his fist .
NEFF: So you went back and started investigating her . That it ?
KEYES: And the stuff that came out . She 'd een dyeing her hair ever since she was sixteen . And there was a manic- depressive in her family , on he mother 's side . And she already had one husband , a professional pool player in Baltimore . And as for he other
NEFF: I get the general idea . She was a tramp from a long line of tramps . He picks up some papers impatiently .
KEYES: All right , I 'm going . What am I to say to Norton ? How about that job I want you for ?
NEFF: I do n't think I want it . Thanks , Keyes , just the same .
KEYES: Fair enough . Just get this I picked you for the job , not because I think you 're so darn smart , but because I thought maybe you were a shade less dumb than the rest of the outfit . I guess I was all wet . You 're not smarter , Walter . You 're just a little taller .
NEFF'S VOICE: That was it , Keyes , and there was no use kidding myself any more . Those fates I was talking about had only een stalling me off . Now they had thrown the switch . The gears had meshed . The machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it . The time for thinking had all run out . From here on it was a question of following the time table , move by move , just as we had it rehearsed . I wanted my time all accounted for fo the rest of the afternoon and up to the last possible moment in the evening . So I arranged to call on a prospect in Pasadena about a public liability bond . When I left the office I put my rate book on the desk as if I had forgotten it . That was part of the alibi .
ATTENDANT: Hiya there , Mr. Neff .
NEFF: How about a wash job on my heap , Charlie ?
ATTENDANT: How soon you want it , Mr. Neff ? I got two cars ahead of you .
NEFF: Anytime you get to it , Charlie . I 'm staying in tonight .
ATTENDANT: Okay , Mr. Neff . Be all shined up fo you in the morning .
NEFF: That left front tire looks a little soft . Check it , will you ?
ATTENDANT: You bet . Check 'em all round . Always do . Neff enters the elevator .
NEFF'S VOICE: Up in my apartment I called Lou Schwartz , one of the salesmen that shared my office . He lived in Westwood . That made it a toll call and there 'd be a record of it . I told him I had forgotten my rate ook and needed some dope on the public liability bond I was figuring . I asked him to call me back . This was another item in my alibi , so that later on I could prove that I had been home .
NEFF'S VOICE: Then I was in the garage . His ca was backed in , just the way I told Phyllis to have it . It was so still I could hear the ticking of the clock on the dashboard . I kept thinking of the place we had picked out to do it , that dark street on the way to the station , and the three honks on the horn that were to be the signal About ten minutes later they came down .
PHYLLIS: You all right , honey ? I 'll have the car out in a second .
DIETRICHSON: Just let me do it my own way . Gra that crutch . She takes one of the crutches from him .
PHYLLIS: Mrs. Tucker went along with he husband last year , did n't she .
DIETRICHSON: Yeah , and what happened to her ? She sat in the hotel lobby for four days straight . Never even saw the guy until we poured him back on the train .
PHYLLIS' VOICE: All right , honey . Just so long as you have a good time .
DIETRICHSON'S VOICE: I wo n't do much dancing , I can tell you that .
PHYLLIS: Remember what the doctor said . If you get careless you might end up with a shorter leg .
DIETRICHSON: So what ? I could break the other one and match them up again .
PHYLLIS: It makes you feel pretty good to get away from me , does n't it ?
DIETRICHSON: It 's only for four days . I 'll be ack Monday at the latest .
PHYLLIS: Do n't forget we 're having the Hobeys for dinner on Monday .
DIETRICHSON: The Hobeys ? We had them last . They owe us a dinner , do n't they ?
PHYLLIS: Maybe they do but I 've already asked them for Monday .
DIETRICHSON: Well , I do n't want to feed the Hobeys .
DIETRICHSON'S VOICE: And I do n't want to eat at thei house either . The food you get there , and that rope he hands out for cigars . Call it off , ca n't you ?
MAN: You handle the redcap and the conductor .
PHYLLIS: Do n't worry .
MAN: Keep them away from me as much as you can . I do n't want to be helped .
PHYLLIS: I said do n't worry , Walter .
NEFF: You start just as soon as the train leaves . At the dairy sign you turn off the highway onto the dirt road . From there it 's exactly eight-tenths of a mile to the dump beside the tracks . Remember ?
PHYLLIS: I remember everything .
NEFF: You 'll be there a little ahead of the train . No speeding . You do n't want any cops stopping you with him in the back .
PHYLLIS: Walter , we 've been through all that so many times .
NEFF: When you turn off the highway , cut all your lights . I 'm going to be ack on the observation platform . I 'll drop off as close to the spot as I can . Wait for the train to pass , then blink your lights twice .
REDCAP: San Francisco train , lady ?
PHYLLIS: Car nine , section eleven . Just my husband going .
REDCAP: Car nine , section eleven . Yessum , this way please .
PHYLLIS: It 's all right , thanks . My husband does n't like to be helped .
CONDUCTOR: Car nine , section eleven . The gentleman only . Thank you .
PHYLLIS: Goodbye , honey . Take awful good care of yourself with that leg .
NEFF: Sure , I will . Just you take it easy going home .
PHYLLIS: I 'll miss you , honey .
REDCAP: Section eleven , suh .
PORTER: All aboard !
PHYLLIS: Good luck , honey .
NEFF: Can you make up my berth right away ?
PORTER: Yes , sir .
NEFF: I 'm going back to the observation car for a smoke .
PORTER: This way , sir . Three cars back .
MAN'S VOICE: Can I pull a chair out for you ?
NEFF: No thanks , I 'd rather stand .
MAN: You going far ?
NEFF: Palo Alto .
MAN: My name 's Jackson . I 'm going all the way to Medford . Medford , Oregon . Had a broken arm myself once .
NEFF: Uh-huh .
JACKSON: That darn cast sure itches something fierce , do n't it ? I thought I 'd go crazy with mine .
NEFF: Used to be .
JACKSON: I bet you left something behind . I always do .
NEFF: My cigar case . Must have left it in my overcoat back in the section .
JACKSON: Care to roll yourself a cigarette , Mr. ?
NEFF: Dietrichson . Thanks . I really prefe cigars . Maybe the porter
JACKSON: I could get your cigars for you . Be glad to , Mr. Dietrichson .
NEFF: That 's darn nice of you . It 's ca nine , section eleven . If you 're sure it 's not too much trouble .
JACKSON: Car nine , section eleven . A pleasure .
NEFF: Okay . This has to go fast . Take his hat and pick up the crutches .
NEFF'S VOICE: On the way back we went over once more what she was to do at the inquest , if they had one , and about the insurance , when that came up . I was afraid she might go to pieces a little , now that we had done it , but she was perfect . No nerves . Not a tear , not even a blink of the eyes
PHYLLIS: Walter . Neff turns back to her .
NEFF: Sure , I 'm going to kiss you .
PHYLLIS: It 's straight down the line , is n't it ?
NEFF: I love you , baby .
NEFF'S VOICE: It was two minutes past eleven as I went up the fire stairs again . Nobody saw me this time either .
CHARLIE: You going to need it after all , Mr. Neff ? I 'm about through .
NEFF: It 's okay , Charlie . Just walking down to the drug store for something to eat . Been working upstairs all evening . My stomach 's getting sore at me .
NEFF'S VOICE: That was all there was to it . Nothing had slipped , nothing had been overlooked , there was nothing to give us away . And yet , Keyes , as I was walking down the street to the drug store , suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong . It sounds crazy , Keyes , but it 's true , so help me I could n't hear my own footsteps . It was the walk of a dead man .
COLORED MAN: Did n't know anybody was here , Mr. Neff . We ai n't cleaned your office yet .
NEFF: Let it go tonight . I 'm busy .
COLORED MAN: Whatever you say , Mr. Neff .
NEFF: That was the longest night I eve lived through , Keyes , and the next day was worse , when the story broke in the papers , and they were talking about it at the office , and the day after that when you started digging into it . I kept my hands in my pockets ecause I thought they were shaking , and I put on dark glasses so people could n't see my eyes , and then I took them off again so people would n't get to wondering why I wore them . I was trying to hold myself together , ut I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces .
KEYES: Come on , Walter . The big boss wants to see us .
NEFF: Okay .
KEYES: Must be .
NEFF: Anything wrong ?
KEYES: The guy 's dead , we had him insured and it 's going to cost us money . That 's always wrong .
NEFF: What have you got so far ?
KEYES: Autopsy report . No heart failure , no apoplexy , no predisposing medical cause of any kind . He died of a broken neck .
NEFF: When is the inquest ?
KEYES: They had it this morning . His wife and daughter made the identification . The train people and some passengers told how he went through to the observation car.. It was all over in forty-five minutes . Verdict , accidental death .
NEFF: What do the police figure ?
KEYES: That he got tangled up in his crutches and fell off the train . They 're satisfied . It 's not their dough .
NORTON: I believe the legal position is now clear , gentlemen . Please stand by . I may need you later . He sees Keyes and Neff .
KEYES: Sorry , Mr. Norton . I did n't know this was formal . Norton smiles frostily .
NORTON: Sit down , gentlemen . Any new developments ?
KEYES: I just talked to this Jackson long distance . Up in Medford , Oregon .
NORTON: Who 's Jackson ?
KEYES: The last guy that saw Dietrichson alive . They were out on the observation platform together talking . Dietrichson wanted a cigar and Jackson went to get Dietrichson 's cigar case for him . When he came back to the observation platform , no Dietrichson . Jackson did n't think anything was wrong until a wire caught up with the train at Santa Barbara . They had found Dietrichson 's body on the tracks near Burbank .
NORTON: Very interesting , about the ciga case .
KEYES: Not much . Dietrichson 's secretary says she did n't know anything about the policy . There is a daughter , but all she remembers is Neff talking to her father about accident insurance at their house one night .
NEFF: I could n't sell him at first . Mrs. Dietrichson opposed it . He told me he 'd think it over . Later on I went down to the oil fields and closed him . He signed the application and gave me his check .
NORTON: A fine piece of salesmanship that was , Mr. Neff .
KEYES: There 's no sense in pushing Neff around . He 's got the best sales record in the office . Are your salesmen supposed to know that the custome is going to fall off a train ?
NORTON: Fall off a train ? Are we sure Dietrichson fell off the train ? There is a charged pause .
KEYES: I do n't get it .
NORTON: You do n't , Mr. Keyes ? Then what do you think of this case ? This policy might cost us a great deal of money . As you know , it contains a double indemnity clause . Just what is you opinion ?
KEYES: No opinion at all .
NORTON: Not even a hunch ? One of those interesting little hunches of yours ?
KEYES: Nope . Not even a hunch .
NORTON: I 'm surprised , Mr. Keyes . I 've formed a very definite opinion . I think I know in fact I know I know what happened to Dietrichson .
KEYES: You know you know what ?
NORTON: I know it was not an accident .
KEYES: Me ? You 've got the ball . Let 's see you run with it .
NORTON: There 's a widespread feeling that just because a man has a large office
SECRETARY: Mrs. Dietrichson .
NORTON: Thank you very much for coming , Mrs. Dietrichson . I assure you I appreciate it . He turns a little towards Keyes .
KEYES: How do you do .
PHYLLIS: How do you do .
NORTON: And Mr. Neff .
PHYLLIS: I 've met Mr. Neff . How do you do .
NORTON: Mrs. Dietrichson , I assure you of our sympathy in your bereavement . I hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss . Phyllis nods silently .
PHYLLIS: No . All I know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent .
NORTON: Your husband had an accident policy with this company . Evidently you do n't know that , Mrs. Dietrichson .
PHYLLIS: No . I remember some talk at the house She looks towards Neff .
NEFF: He took it out a few days later , Mrs. Dietrichson .
PHYLLIS: I see .
NORTON: You 'll probably find the policy among his personal effects .
PHYLLIS: His safe deposit box has n't been opened yet . It seems a tax examine has to be present .
NORTON: Please , Mrs. Dietrichson , I do n't want you to think you are being subjected to any questioning . But there are a few things we should like to know .
PHYLLIS: What sort of things ?
NORTON: We have the report of the coroner 's inquest . Accidental death . We are not entirely satisfied . In fact we are not satisfied at all . Phyllis looks at him coolly . Keyes looks vaguely interested . Neff is staring straight at Phyllis .
PHYLLIS: Please .
NORTON: Mr. Neff .
PHYLLIS: Thank you . Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second .
NORTON: Had your husband been moody o depressed lately , Mrs. Dietrichson ? Did he seem to have financial worries , for instance ?
PHYLLIS: He was perfectly all right and I do n't know of any financial worries .
NORTON: There must have been something , Mrs. Dietrichson . Let us examine this so- called accident . First , your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy . Why ? Because he does n't want his family to suspect what he intends to do .
PHYLLIS: Do what ?
NORTON: Commit suicide . Next , he goes on this trip entirely alone . He has to e alone . He hobbles all the way out to the observation platform , very unlikely with his leg in a cast , unless he has a very strong reason . Once there , he finds he is not alone . There is a man there . What was his name , Keyes ?
KEYES: His name was Jackson . Probably still is .
NORTON: Jackson . So your husband gets rid of this Jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars . And then he is alone . And then he does it . He jumps . Suicide . In which case the company is not liable . You know that , of course . We could go to court
PHYLLIS: I do n't know anything . In fact I do n't know why I came here . She makes as if to rise indignantly .
NORTON: Just a moment , please . I said we could go to court . I did n't say we want to . Not only is it against ou practice , but it would involve a great deal of expense , a lot of lawyers , a lot of time , perhaps years . Phyllis rises coldly .
PHYLLIS: Do n't bother , Mr. Norton . When I came in here I had no idea you owed me any money . You told me you did . Then you told me you did n't . Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it , whatever it is . You want to argain with me , at a time like this . I do n't like your insinuations about my husband , Mr. Norton , and I do n't like your methods . In fact I do n't like you , Mr. Norton . Goodbye , gentlemen .
KEYES: Nice going , Mr. Norton . You sure carried that ball .
NORTON: I have n't eh ? Let her claim . Let he sue . We can prove it was suicide . Keyes stands up .
KEYES: Can we ? Mr. Norton , the first thing that hit me was that suicide angle . Only I dropped it in the wastepape asket just three seconds later . You ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime . You might learn a little something about the insurance usiness .
NORTON: I was raised in the insurance usiness , Mr. Keyes .
KEYES: Yeah . In the front office . Come on , you never read an actuarial table in your life . I 've got ten volumes on suicide alone . Suicide by race , by color , by occupation , by sex , by seasons of the year , by time of day . Suicide , how committed by poisons , y fire-arms , by drowning , by leaps . Suicide by poison , subdivided by types of poison , such as corrosive , irritant , systemic , gaseous , narcotic , alkaloid , protein , and so forth . Suicide by leaps , subdivided by leaps from high places , under wheels of trains , under wheels of trucks , unde the feet of horses , from steamboats . But Mr. Norton , of all the cases on ecord there 's not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train . And do you know how fast that train was going at the point where the body was found ? Fifteen miles an hour . Now how could anybody jump off a slow moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself ? No soap , Mr. Norton . We 're sunk , and we 're going to pay through the nose , and you know it . May I have this ?
NEFF: I could have hugged you right then and there , Keyes , you and you statistics . You were the only one we were really scared of , and instead you were almost playing on our team
NEFF'S VOICE: That evening when I got home my nerves had eased off . I could feel the ground under my feet again , and it looked like easy going from there on it .
NEFF: Hello Hello , baby . Sure , everything is fine You were wonderful in Norton 's office .
PHYLLIS: I felt so funny . I wanted to look at you all the time .
NEFF: How do you think I felt ? Where are you , baby ?
PHYLLIS: At the drug store . Just a block away . Can I come up ?
NEFF: Okay . But be careful . Do n't let anybody see you .
KEYES: That broken leg . The guy broke his leg .
NEFF: What are you talking about ?
KEYES: Talking about Dietrichson . He had accident insurance , did n't he ? Then he broke his leg , did n't he ?
NEFF: So what ?
KEYES: And he did n't put in a claim . Why did n't he put in a claim ? Why ?
NEFF: What the dickens are you driving at ?
KEYES: Walter . There 's something wrong . I ate dinner two hours ago . It stuck half way . He prods his stomach with his thumb .
NEFF: Because he did n't put in a claim ? Maybe he just did n't have time .
KEYES: Oh maybe he just did n't know he was insured .
NEFF: Sure , I did . Keyes prods his stomach again .
KEYES: Got any bicarbonate of soda ?
NEFF: No I have n't . Keyes resumes his pacing .
KEYES: Listen , Walter . I 've been living with this little man for twenty-six years . He 's never failed me yet . There 's got to be something wrong .
NEFF: Maybe Norton was right . Maybe it was suicide , Keyes .
KEYES: No . Not suicide . But not accident either .
NEFF: What else ?
KEYES: Look . A man takes out an accident policy that is worth a hundred thousand dollars if he is killed on a train . Then , two weeks later , he is killed on a train . And not in a train accident , mind you , but falling off some silly observation car . Do you know what the mathematical probability of that is , Walter ? One out of I do n't know how many billions . And add to that the broken leg . It just ca n't be the way it looks , Walter . Something has been worked on us .
NEFF: Such as what ?
KEYES: Do n't you have any peppermint o anything ?
NEFF: I 'm sorry . Who do you suspect ?
KEYES: Maybe I like to make things easy fo myself . But I always tend to suspect the beneficiary .
NEFF: The wife ?
KEYES: Yeah . That wide-eyed dame that did n't know anything about anything .
NEFF: You 're crazy , Keyes . She was n't even on the train .
KEYES: I know she was n't , Walter . I do n't claim to know how it was worked , o who worked it , but I know that it was worked . He crosses to the corridor door .
NEFF: Good night , Keyes .
KEYES: See you at the office in the morning .
NEFF: Only you have n't got a single thing to go on , Keyes . The elevator has come up and stopped .
KEYES: Not too much . Twenty-six years experience , all the percentage there is , and this lump of concrete in my stomach .
PHYLLIS: How much does he know ?
NEFF: It 's not what he knows . It 's those stinking hunches of his .
PHYLLIS: But he ca n't prove anything , can he ?
NEFF: Not if we 're careful . Not if we do n't see each other for a while .
PHYLLIS: For how long a while ? She moves toward him but he does not respond .
NEFF: Until all this dies down . You do n't know Keyes the way I do . Once he gets his teeth into something he wo n't let go . He 'll investigate you . He 'll have you shadowed . He 'll watch you every minute from now on . Are you afraid , baby ?
PHYLLIS: Yes , I 'm afraid . But not of Keyes . I 'm afraid of us . We 're not the same any more . We did it so we could be together , but instead of that it 's pulling us apart . Is n't it , Walter ?
NEFF: What are you talking about ?
PHYLLIS: And you do n't really care whether we see each other or not .
NEFF: Shut up , baby . He pulls her close and kisses her .
LOLA: Hello , Mr. Neff . Neff looks at her a little startled .
NEFF: Hello . His voice hangs in the air .
LOLA: Lola Dietrichson . Do n't you remembe me ?
NEFF: Yes . Of course .
LOLA: Could I talk to you , just for a few minutes ? Somewhere where we can be alone ?
NEFF: Sure . Come on into my office .
LOLA: Yes , Mr. Neff . It 's about my father 's death .
NEFF: I 'm terribly sorry , Miss Dietrichson .
SCHWARTZ: It 's all yours , Walter .
NEFF: Wo n't you sit down ?
LOLA: Mr. Neff , I ca n't help it , but I have such a strange feeling that there is something queer about my father 's death .
NEFF: Queer ? Queer in what way ?
LOLA: I do n't know why I should be bothering you with my troubles , except that you knew my father and knew about the insurance he took out . And you were so nice to me that evening in your car .
NEFF: Sure . We got along fine , did n't we . He sits down . His face is grim and watchful .
LOLA: Look at me , Mr. Neff . I 'm not crazy . I 'm not hysterical . I 'm not even crying . But I have the awful feeling that something is wrong , and I had the same feeling once before when my mother died .
NEFF: When your mother died ?
LOLA: We were up at Lake Arrowhead . That was six years ago . We had a cabin there . It was winter and very cold and my mother was very sick with pneumonia . She had a nurse with her . There were just the three of us in the cabin . One night I got up and went into my mother 's room . She was delirious with fever . All the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open . The nurse was n't in the room . I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could . Just then I heard a door open behind me . The nurse stood there . She did n't say a word , but there was a look in her eyes I 'll never forget . Two days later my mother was dead . Do you know who that nurse was ?
NEFF: No . Who ?
LOLA: Phyllis . I tried to tell my father , ut I was just a kid then and he would n't listen to me . Six months later she married him and I kind of talked myself out of the idea that she could have done anything like that . But now it 's all back again , now that something has happened to my father , too .
NEFF: You 're not making sense , Miss Dietrichson . Your father fell off a train .
LOLA: Yes , and two days before he fell off that train what was Phyllis doing ? She was in her room in front of a mirror , with a black hat on , and she was pinning a black veil to it , as if she could n't wait to see how she would look in mourning .
NEFF: Look . You 've had a pretty bad shock . Are n't you just imagining all this ?
LOLA: I caught her eyes in the mirror , and they had that look in them they had efore my mother died . That same look .
NEFF: You do n't like your step-mother , do you ? Is n't it just because she is your step-mother ?
LOLA: I loathe her . Because she did it . She did it for the money . Only you 're not going to pay her , are you , Mr. Neff ? She 's not going to get away with it this time . I 'm going to speak up . I 'm going to tell everything I know .
NEFF: You 'd better be careful , saying things like that .
LOLA: I 'm not afraid . You 'll see .
NEFF: All this that you 've been telling me who else have you told ?
LOLA: No one .
NEFF: How about your step-mother ?
LOLA: Of course not . I 'm not living in the house any more . I moved out .
NEFF: And you did n't tell that boy-friend of yours ? Zachetti .
LOLA: I 'm not seeing him any more . We had a fight .
NEFF: Where are you living then ?
LOLA: I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood .
NEFF: Four walls , and you just sit and look at them , huh ?
LOLA: Yes , Mr. Neff .
NEFF'S VOICE: So I took her to dinner that evening at a Mexican joint down on Olvera Street where nobody would see us . I wanted to cheer her up..
KEYES: Come in . Come in , Walter . I want to ask you something . After all the years we 've known each other , do you mind if I make a rather blunt statement ?
NEFF: About what ?
KEYES: About me . Walter , I 'm a very great man . This Dietrichson business . It 's murder , and murders do n't come any neater . As fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into . Smart and tricky and almost perfect , but
NEFF: I 'm listening . Keyes levels a finger at him .
KEYES: You know what ? That guy Dietrichson was never on the train .
NEFF: He was n't ?
KEYES: No , he was n't , Walter . Look , you ca n't be sure of killing a man by throwing him off a train that 's going fifteen miles an hour . The only way you can be sure is to kill him first and then throw his body on the tracks . That would mean either killing him on the train , or and this is where it really gets fancy you kill him somewhere else and put him on the tracks . Two possibilities , and I personally buy the second .
NEFF: You 're way ahead of me , Keyes .
KEYES: Look , it was like this . They killed the guy the wife and somebody else and then the somebody else took the crutches and went on the train as Dietrichson , and then the somebody else jumped off , and then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed . An impersonation , see . And a cinch to work . Because it was night , very few people were about , they had the crutches to stare at , and they neve eally looked at the man at all .
NEFF: It 's fancy all right , Keyes . Maybe it 's a little too fancy .
KEYES: Is it ? I tell you it fits togethe like a watch . And now let 's see what we have in the way of proof . The only guy that really got a good look at this supposed Dietrichson is sitting right outside my office . I took the trouble to bring him down here from Oregon . Let 's see what he has to say . Keyes goes to the door and opens it .
JACKSON: Yes sir , Mr. Keyes . These are fine cigars you smoke . He indicates the cigar he himself is smoking .
KEYES: Two for a quarter .
JACKSON: That 's what I said .
KEYES: Never mind the cigar , Jackson . Did you study those photographs ? What do you say ?
JACKSON: Yes , indeed , I studied them thoroughly . Very thoroughly
KEYES: Well ? Did you make up your mind ?
JACKSON: Mr. Keyes , I 'm a Medford man . Medford , Oregon . Up in Medford we take ou time making up our minds
KEYES: Well you 're not in Medford now . I 'm in a hurry . Let 's have it .
JACKSON: Are these photographs of the late Mr. Dietrichson ?
KEYES: Yes .
JACKSON: Then my answer is no .
KEYES: What do you mean no ?
JACKSON: I mean this is not the man that was on the train .
KEYES: Will you swear to that ?
JACKSON: I 'm a Medford man . Medford , Oregon . And if I say it , I mean it , and if I mean it , of course I 'll swear it .
KEYES: Thank you . Keyes turns to Neff .
JACKSON: Please to meet you , Mr. Neff . Pleased indeed .
NEFF: How do you do .
JACKSON: Very fine , thank you . Never was etter .
KEYES: Mr. Jackson , how would you describe the man you saw on that observation platform ?
JACKSON: Well , I 'm pretty sure he was a younge man , about ten or fifteen years younger than the man in these photographs .
KEYES: Dietrichson was about fifty , was n't he , Walter ?
NEFF: Fifty-one , according to the policy .
JACKSON: The man I saw was nothing like fifty- one years old . Of course , it was pretty dark on that platform and , come to think of it , he tried to keep his back towards me . But I 'm positive just the same .
KEYES: That 's fine , Jackson . Now you understand this matter is strictly confidential . We may need you again down here in Los Angeles , if the case comes to court .
JACKSON: Any time you need me , I 'm at you entire disposal , gentlemen . Expenses paid , of course .
KEYES: Get me Lubin , in the cashier 's office .
JACKSON: Ever been in Medford , Mr. Neff ?
NEFF: Never .
JACKSON: Wait a minute . Do you go trout fishing ? Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way .
NEFF: Nope . Never fish .
JACKSON: Neff . Neff . I 've got it ! It 's the name . There 's a family of Neffs in Corvallis .
NEFF: No relation .
JACKSON: Let me see . This man 's an automobile dealer in Corvallis . Very reputable man , too , I 'm told . Keyes rejoins them at this point .
KEYES: All right , Mr. Jackson . Suppose you go down to the cashier 's office oom twenty-seven on the eleventh floor . They 'll take care of you expense account and your ticket fo the train tonight .
JACKSON: Tonight ? Tomorrow morning would suit me better . There 's a very good osteopath down here I want to see efore I leave . Keyes has opened the door for Jackson .
KEYES: Okay , Mr. Jackson . Just do n't put her on the expense account . Jackson does n't get it .
JACKSON: Goodbye , gentlemen . A pleasure . He goes out .
KEYES: There it is , Walter . It 's beginning to come apart at the seams already . A murder 's never perfect . It always comes apart sooner or later . And when two people are involved it 's usually sooner . We know the Dietrichson dame is in it , and somebody else . Pretty soon we 're going to know who that somebody else is . He 'll show . He 's got to show . Sometime , somewhere , they 've got to meet . Their emotions are all kicked up . Whether it 's love or hate does n't matter . They ca n't keep away from each other . They think it 's twice as safe because there are two of them . But it 's not twice as safe . It 's ten times twice as dangerous . They 've committed a murder and that 's not like taking a trolley ride togethe where each one can get off at a different stop . They 're stuck with each other . They 've got to ride all the way to the end of the line . And it 's a one-way trip , and the last stop is the cemetery .
NEFF: Mrs. Dietrichson ? This is Jerry 's market . We just got in a shipment of that English soap you were asking about . Will you be coming by this morning ? Thank you , Mrs. Dietrichson . Neff hangs up .
PHYLLIS: Hello , Walter .
NEFF: Come closer . Phyllis moves close to him .
PHYLLIS: What 's the matter ?
NEFF: Everything 's the matter . Keyes is ejecting your claim . He 's sitting ack with his mouth watering , waiting for you to sue . He wants you to sue . But you 're not going to .
PHYLLIS: What 's he got to stop me ?
NEFF: He 's got the goods . He 's figured out how it was worked . He knows it was somebody else on the train . He 's dug up a witness he thinks will prove it .
PHYLLIS: Prove it how ? Listen , if he rejects that claim , I have to sue .
NEFF: Yeah ? And then you 're in court and a lot of other things are going to come up . Like , for instance , about you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson . Phyllis looks at him sharply , sideways .
PHYLLIS: What about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson ?
NEFF: The way she died . And about that lack hat you were trying on before you needed a black hat .
PHYLLIS: Walter , Lola 's been telling you some of her cockeyed stories . She 's been seeing you .
NEFF: I 've been seeing her , if you want to know . So she wo n't yell her head off about what she knows .
PHYLLIS: Yes , she 's been putting on an act for you , crying all over you shoulder , that lying little
NEFF: Keep her out of it . All I 'm telling you is we 're not going to sue .
PHYLLIS: Because you do n't want the money any more , even if you could get it ? Because she 's made you feel like a heel all of sudden .
NEFF: It is n't the money any more . It 's our necks now . We 're pulling out , understand .
PHYLLIS: Because of what Keyes can do ? You 're not fooling me , Walter . It 's because of Lola . What you did to her father . You ca n't take it that she might find out some day .
NEFF: I said , leave her out of it .
PHYLLIS: Walter , it 's me I 'm talking about . I do n't want to be left out of it .
NEFF: Stop saying that . It 's just that it has n't worked out the way we wanted . We ca n't have the money . We ca n't go through with it , that 's all .
PHYLLIS: We have gone through with it , Walter . The tough part is all behind us . We just have to hold on now and not go soft inside , and stick together , close , the way we started out .
NEFF: Watch it , will you . Someone 's coming .
PHYLLIS: I loved you , Walter . And I hated him . But I was n't going to do anything about it , not until I met you . It was you had the plan . I only wanted him dead .
NEFF: Yeah , and I was the one that fixed him so he was dead . Is that what you 're telling me ?
PHYLLIS: Yes . And nobody 's pulling out . We went into it together , and we 're coming out at the end together . It 's straight down the line for both of us , remember . Phyllis puts the glasses on again and goes .
NEFF'S VOICE: Yeah . I remembered all right . Just as I remembered what you had told me , Keyes , about that trolley ca ide and how there was no way to get off until the end of the line .
NEFF: Yeah , I remembered it all right . Just as I remembered what you had told me , Keyes , about that trolley car ride , and how there was no way to get off until the end of the line , where the cemetery was . And I got to thinking what cemeteries are for . They 're to put dead people in , I guess that was the first time I eve thought about Phyllis that way . Dead , I mean , and how things would be if she was dead . Because the way it was now she had me by the throat . She could hang me higher than a kite any day she felt like it . And there was nothing I could do , except hold my eath and watch that day come close and closer , and maybe pray a little , if I still knew how to pray I saw Lola three or four times that week . I guess it sounds crazy , Keyes , afte what I had done , but it was only with her that I could relax and let go a little . Then one night we drove up into the hills above Hollywood Bowl
LOLA: Of course I will , Walter . I would n't tell anybody else but you . It 's about Nino .
NEFF: Zachetti ? What about him ?
LOLA: They killed my father together . He and Phyllis . He helped her do it . I know he did .
NEFF: What makes you say that ?
LOLA: I 've been following him . He 's at he house , night after night . It was Phyllis and him all the time . Maybe he was going with me just for a blind . And the night of the murder
NEFF: You promised not to talk that way any more .
LOLA: he was supposed to pick me up after a lecture at U.C.L.A . but he never showed up . He said he was sick . Sick ! He could n't show up , ecause the train was leaving with my father on it . She begins to cry again .
NEFF: Sure , it 's all in your mind .
LOLA: I only wish it was , Walter , because I still love him .
NEFF'S VOICE: Zachetti . That 's funny . Phyllis and Zachetti . What was he doing up at her house ? I could n't figure that one out I tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere . But the real ain-twister came the next day . You sprang it on me , Keyes , after office hours , when you caught me down in the lobby of the building .
KEYES' VOICE: Oh , Walter , just a minute .
NEFF: Hello , Keyes .
KEYES: Hang onto your hat , Walter .
NEFF: What for ?
KEYES: Nothing much . The Dietrichson case just busted wide open .
NEFF: How do you mean ?
KEYES: The guy showed . That 's how .
NEFF: The somebody else ?
KEYES: Yeah . The guy that did it with her .
NEFF: No kidding ?
KEYES: She 's filed suit against us , and it 's okay by me . When we get into that courtroom I 'll tear them apart , oth of them . Come on I 'll buy you a martini .
NEFF: No thanks , Keyes .
KEYES: With two olives .
NEFF: I 've got to get a shave and a shoeshine . I 've got a date .
KEYES: Margie . I still bet she drinks from the bottle .
NEFF: They give you matches when they sell you cigars , Keyes . All you have to do is ask for them .
KEYES: I do n't like them . They always explode in my pockets . So long , Walter .
NEFF'S VOICE: You sure had me worried , Keyes . I did n't know if you were playing cat- and-mouse with me , whether you knew all along I was the somebody else . That 's what I had to find out , and I thought I knew where to look
NEFF: Twelve .
NEFF'S VOICE: Upstairs , the last of the people were just leaving .
KEYES' VOICE: Memo to Mr. Norton . Confidential . Dietrichson File . With regard to your proposal to put Walter Neff under surveillance , I disagree absolutely . I have investigated his movements on the night of the crime , and he is definitely placed in his apartment from 7 15 P.M. on . In addition to this , I have known Neff intimately for eleven years , and I personally vouch for him , without eservation
NEFF: Phyllis ? Walter . I 've got to see you Tonight Yes , it has to be tonight How 's eleven o'clock ? Do n't worry about Keyes . He 's satisfied Leave the door on the latch and put the lights out . No , nobody 's watching the house I told you Keyes is satisfied . It 's just for the neighbors That 's what I said . Yeah . Eleven o'clock . Goodbye , baby .
NEFF'S VOICE: I guess I do n't have to tell you what I was going to do at eleven o'clock , Keyes . For the first time I saw a way to get clear of the whole mess I was in , and of Phyllis , too , all at the same time . Yeah , that 's what I thought . But what I did n't know was that she was all set fo me . That she had outsmarted me again , just like she always had
PHYLLIS: In here , Walter .
NEFF: Hello , baby . Anybody else in the house ?
PHYLLIS: Nobody . Why ?
NEFF: What 's that music ?
PHYLLIS: A radio up the street .
NEFF: Just like the first time I was here . We were talking about automobile insurance . Only you were thinking about murder . And I was thinking about that anklet .
PHYLLIS: And what are you thinking about now ?
NEFF: I 'm all through thinking . This is goodbye .
PHYLLIS: Goodbye ? Where are you going ?
NEFF: It 's you that 's going , baby . Not me . I 'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner .
PHYLLIS: Suppose you stop being fancy . Let 's have it , whatever it is .
NEFF: I have a friend who 's got a funny theory . He says when two people commit a murder they 're kind of on a trolley car , and one ca n't get off without the other . They 're stuck with each other . They have to go on riding clear to the end of the line . And the last stop is the cemetery .
PHYLLIS: Maybe he 's got something there .
NEFF: You bet he has , Two people are going to ride to the end of the line , all ight . Only I 'm not going to be one of them . I 've got another guy to finish my ride for me .
PHYLLIS: So you 've got it all arranged , Walter .
NEFF: You arranged it for me . I did n't have to do a thing .
PHYLLIS: Just who are you talking about ?
NEFF: An acquaintance of yours . A Mr. Zachetti . Come on , baby , I just got into this because I knew a little something about insurance , did n't I ? I was just a sucker . I 'd have been ushed-off as soon as you got you hands on the money .
PHYLLIS: What are you talking about ?
NEFF: Save it . I 'm telling this . It 's been you and that Zachetti guy all along , has n't it ?
PHYLLIS: That 's not true .
NEFF: It does n't make any difference whethe it 's true or not . The point is Keyes elieves Zachetti is the guy he 's een looking for . He 'll have him in that gas chamber before he knows what happened to him .
PHYLLIS: And what 's happening to me all this time ?
NEFF: Do n't be silly . What do you expect to happen to you ? You helped him do the murder , did n't you ? That 's what Keyes thinks . And what 's good enough for Keyes is good enough for me .
PHYLLIS: Maybe it 's not good enough for me . Walter . Maybe I do n't go for the idea . Maybe I 'd rather talk .
NEFF: Sometimes people are where they ca n't talk . Under six feet of dirt , fo instance . And if it was you , they 'd just charge it up to Zachetti , would n't they . One more item on his account . Sure they would . That 's just what they 're going to do . Especially since he 's coming here , tonight Oh , in about fifteen minutes from now , baby . With the cops right behind him . It 's all taken care of .
PHYLLIS: And that 'd make everything lovely for you , would n't it ?
NEFF: Right . And it 's got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial , and Lola gets a chance to sound off , and they trip you up on the stand , and you start to fold up and drag me down with you .
PHYLLIS: Listen , Walter . Maybe I had Zachetti here so they wo n't get a chance to trip me up . So we can get that money and be together .
NEFF: That 's cute . Say it again .
PHYLLIS: He came here the first time just to ask where Lola was . I made him come ack . I was working on him . He 's crazy sort of guy , quick-tempered . I kept hammering into him that she was with another man , so he 'd get into one of his jealous rages , and then I 'd tell him where she was . And you know what he 'd have done to her , do n't you , Walter .
NEFF: Yeah , and for once I believe you . Because it 's just rotten enough .
PHYLLIS: We 're both rotten , Walter .
NEFF: Only you 're just a little more rotten . You 're rotten clear through . You got me to take care of your husband , and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola , and maybe take care of me too , and then somebody else would have come along to take care of Zachetti for you . That 's the way you operate is n't it , baby .
PHYLLIS: Suppose it is , Walter . Is what you 've cooked up for tonight any better ?
NEFF: I do n't like this music anymore . It 's too close . Do you mind if I shut the window ?
PHYLLIS: Walter !
NEFF: What 's the matter ? Why do n't you shoot again ? Maybe if I came a little closer ?
PHYLLIS: No . I never loved you , Walter . Not you , or anybody else . I 'm rotten to the heart . I used you , just as you said . That 's all you ever meant to me until a minute ago . I did n't think anything like that could eve happen to me .
NEFF: I 'm sorry , baby . I 'm not buying .
PHYLLIS: I 'm not asking you to buy . Just hold me close .
NEFF: Goodbye , baby .
ZACHETTI: Yeah ? And I still do n't like it . What do you want ?
NEFF: Look , kid , I want to give you a present .
ZACHETTI: What 's the gag ?
NEFF: Suppose you go back down the hill to a drug store and make a phone call .
ZACHETTI: Keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice cream cone .
NEFF: The number is Granite 0386 . Ask fo Miss Dietrichson . The first name is Lola .
ZACHETTI: Lola ? She is n't worth a nickel . And if I ever talk to her , it 's not going to be over any telephone .
NEFF: Tough , are n't you ? Take the nickel . Take it and call her . She wants you to .
ZACHETTI: Yeah ? She does n't want any part of me .
NEFF: I know who told you that , and it 's not true . She 's in love with you . Always has been . Do n't ask me why . I could n't even guess .
KEYES: The janitor did . Seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here .
NEFF: Would n't be surprised .
KEYES: So I gather .
NEFF: How long have you been standing there ?
KEYES: Long enough .
NEFF: Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it . One you did n't quite figure out .
KEYES: You ca n't figure them all , Walter .
NEFF: That 's right . You ca n't , can you ? And now I suppose I get the big speech , the one with all the two- dollar words in it . Let 's have it , Keyes .
KEYES: You 're all washed up , Walter .
NEFF: Thanks , Keyes . That was short anyway .
KEYES: Walter , I 'm going to call a doctor .
NEFF: What for ? So they can patch me up ? So they can nurse me along till I 'm ack on my feet ? So I can walk unde my own power into that gas chambe up in San Quentin ? Is that it , Keyes ?
KEYES: Something like that , Walter .
NEFF: Well , I 've got a different idea . Look here . Suppose you went back to ed and did n't find these cylinders till tomorrow morning , when the office opens . From then on you can play it any way you like . Would you do that much for me , Keyes ?
KEYES: Give me one good reason .
NEFF: I need four hours to get where I 'm going .
KEYES: You 're not going anywhere , Walter .
NEFF: You bet I am . I 'm going across the order .
KEYES: You have n't got a chance .
NEFF: Good enough to try for .
KEYES: You 'll never make the border .
NEFF: That 's what you think . Watch me .
KEYES: You 'll never even make the elevator .
NEFF: So long , Keyes .
KEYES' VOICE: Hello Send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street Yeah It 's a police job .
KEYES: How you doing , Walter ? Neff manages a faint smile .
NEFF: I 'm fine . Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away .
KEYES: They 're on the way .
NEFF: You know why you did n't figure this one , Keyes ? Let me tell you . The guy you were looking for was too close . He was right across the desk from you .
KEYES: Closer than that , Walter .
NEFF: I love you too .
KEYES: They 're on the way .
NEFF: You know why you did n't figure this one , Keyes ? Let me tell you . The guy you were looking for was too close . He was right across the desk from you .
KEYES: Closer than that , Walter .
NEFF: I love you too .
GUARD: That 's all , gentlemen , Vacate the chamber , please .
THE END: < /pre
STEPHANIE: There is no friction , with prope diction . Good sounds abound , when the mouth is round .
MEXICAN MAN: We keep getting the same thing . Because I 'm not employed by an American company , they wo n't take my application until they get my solvency statement . And the Mexican Treasury Department says that 's going to take at least four more weeks .
MEXICAN WOMAN: And the house will be gone by then .
STEPHANIE: It says , here your employed by Pemex ?
MEXICAN: That 's right .
STEPHANIE: Is n't Pemex a subsidiary of Union Oil ?
ELLEN: I need clarification on the shoe issue .
STEPHANIE: Okay
ELLEN: First of all you know you 've got the only perfect pair of black dress shoes in L.A . So was that a definite , irrevocable , `` no way '' o t just a rather not at this time , `` no way '' ?

ELLEN: What about the shoes ?
STEPHANIE: I told you . No . Now beat it .
ELLEN: Sure . If I can take the shoes .
STEPHANIE: I told you , no .
MR. JACKS: Has someone brought a damned animal into my bank ? !
STEPHANIE: Okay , fine ! Take the shoes !

STEPHANIE: Of course not . I 'll take care of everything . And thanks for choosing Bank of California . Ellen plays along .
ELLEN: Okay . Then I 'll see you later . I mean- whenever the next time I 'm in the bank . You know for a loan .
STEPHANIE: Goodbye .
MR. JACKS: Someone has definitely brought an animal in here . He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits .
STEPHANIE: I do n't see any cats . Or any animals .
MR. JACKS: Hope to hell , not .
STEPHANIE: By the way , I put the paperwork fo the Mcpherson loan on your desk .
MR. JACKS: Mcpherson ?
STEPHANIE: That big corporate loan I 've been trying to set up ? It 's just preliminary but
MR. JACKS: Oh , right . I 'll look it over when I get the chance .
STEPHANIE: Mr. Jacks , I was wondering it you had made any decision regarding the Assistant Manager 's position yet ?
MR. JACKS: I 'm still deciding . Right now it 's etween Stu and yourself .
STEPHANIE: Stu ? The trainee ?
MR. JACKS: I know he 's new but he 's also quite aggressive and we like that . Do n't get me wrong , you 're well liked here , but we 're also looking fo someone who 's not afraid to crunch the numbers and make the tough decisions .
STEPHANIE: Mr. Jacks , I feel that I 'm perfectly capable of
MR. JACKS: I 'll let you know as soon as , I decide . In the meantime , take him through our loan qualifying procedures just in case .
STEPHANIE: Oh . okay .
MR JACKS: And would you mind taking you lunch now ?
STEPHANIE: Sure .
MR. JACKS: And on your way back , maybe you could bring me a turkey club ? Stu overhears them as he passes by .
STU: Turkey club . Excellent choice , J.J. Then to Stephanie
STEPHANIE: No problem .
STU: On toasted rye ! And spicy mustard !
STEPHANIE: Sure .
RAY: The conscious mind abhors uncertainty . It seeks a pattern o eason for everything . When we ca n't find that pattern or reason , we sometimes ascribe it 's cause to the world of the supernatural . The spiritual world is created by the human mind to conveniently explain everything we ca n't . So when does a elief in the supernatural cross into the field of abnormal ehavior ? Where do you , the Psychologist , come in ? When these eliefs negatively affect ou patients activities of daily living . Their jobs , their friends , their sense of well being The class bell RINGS .
STEPHANIE: I do n't know .
RAY: Really ? You sounded so sure .
STEPHANIE: Well , now there 's this new guy they 're considering him too .
RAY: That job needs somebody with you experience . They know that . Stephanie nods .
STEPHANIE: Oh , I 've got something for you .
RAY: A 1925 Indian head ! Hey , good find . Where 'd you get it ?
STEPHANIE: One of the tellers found it for me .
RAY: Thanks .
STEPHANIE: I 'd better get back to work .
RAY: Hi Mom , can you hold on a sec ?
RAY'S VOICE: Nothing much . Just had lunch with Stephanie . And trying to get these midterms graded
TRUDY'S VOICE: Stephanie ? The one from the farm ?
RAY'S VOICE: You know who she is . She 's coming over for dinner tomorrow night to meet you and dad .
RAY'S VOICE: What ?
TRUDY'S VOICE: I mean she 's just a teller at some ank right ? Raymond there 's a eason that your father and I aised you in a certain way . We have expectations .
RAY'S VOICE: Please , mom , not this again
TRUDY'S VOICE: I heard that Julie Kulick is looking for someone to play tennis with . You know she graduated Yale law with honors . I 'm told she 's quite a successful attorney now . I gave you her number but her mothe says you never called .
RAY'S VOICE: Because I 'm with Stephanie . I 'm not looking for anybody else .
TRUDY'S VOICE: Would it kill you to
RAY'S VOICE: Mom . I have to go . See you tomorrow night . Okay ? Bye . A downhearted Stephanie quietly exits .
STU: She messed up my order . Stephanie heard that .
STEPHANIE: No I did n't , Stu .
STU: Steph , I said `` no mayo '' .
STEPHANIE: You never said that . Stu rolls his eyes to Mr. Jacks .
MRS. GANUSH: Will you help me ?
STEPHANIE: Of course . What can I do for you ?
MRS. GANUSH: The trucks are there now . The men are packing all my things . Private things . Please , make them stop . This is my home for twenty years . And I make every payment until the sickness took my eye .
STEPHANIE: Well do you have the payment with you now ?
MRS. GANUSH: I hope to get it soon . I just need a little more time .
STEPHANIE: I do n't think my manager is going to extend you anymore credit . I 'd like to help but
MRS. GANUSH: Please . Wo n't you try ?
STEPHANIE: Okay . Wait here .
MR. JACKS: What 's up ?
STEPHANIE: I 've got an elderly woman asking for an extension on her mortgage payment.. They 're in the process of epossessing her home . She 's on a fixed income and she 's had some medical problems . I was wondering if we could give her a break .
MR. JACKS: Apparently , we 've already granted her two extensions . And you know on this type of foreclosure , the ank makes a sizable amount in fees . He hands her back the file .
STEPHANIE: It would mean I 'd have to throw he out of her house .
MR. JACKS: Tough decision . Your call .
STEPHANIE: I 'll take care of it . Stephanie returns to her desk .
MRS. GANUSH: What ?
STEPHANIE: I 'm sorry .
MRS. GANUSH: No . Please , it 's my home I 'm egging you .
STEPHANIE: I tried to talk my boss into it but he just would n't approve .
MRS. GANUSH: But where will I live ?
STEPHANIE: Mrs. Ganush , you 've given you granddaughter as a reference It says here , she lives nearby Would n't you be better off living with her ?
MRS. GANUSH: I would not burden her .
STEPHANIE: Okay well , there 's several fine `` assisted living '' facilities fo the elderly .
MRS GANUSH: A nursing home ? No . I will neve live in one of those places1
STEPHANIE: Well , of course , that 's you choice .
MRS. GANUSH: It 's yours .
STEPHANIE: I 'm sorry there 's nothing I can do . Mrs. Ganush begins to sob .
MRS. GANUSH: I am proud woman , Miss Brown , and never have I begged for anything . But I will beg for you now . This one time . I humble myself before you .
STEPHANIE: That is n't necessary , please . Let 's not make this personal . It 's just the bank 's policy . I 'm really sorry Mrs. Ganush .
MRS. GANUSH: Have mercy on me .
STEPHANIE: Please , let go .
MR. JACKS: What the hell ?
MRS. GANUSH: I , Sylvia Ganush , beg . On my mother 's grave , I beg you .
STEPHANIE: Please , take your hands off me . But the old woman only clutches tighter .
MRS. GANUSH: You shame me .
SECURITY GUARD: I think your business here is finished , ma'am .
MR. JACKS: That was one nutty old lady . You okay ? Stephanie nods .
STEPHANIE: Thanks .
MRS. GANUSH: You bitch ! I pluck out your fucking eyes !
STEPHANIE: I beat you , you old bitch ! Next time take your Geretol !
MRS. GANUSH: You shamed me .
STEPHANIE: What ? What are you doing ?
MRS. GANUSH: You want it ?
STEPHANIE: What cry ?
MRS. GANUSH: The Lamia . It 's coming for you .
RAY: What about a restraining order ?
OFFICER NAIMARK: Well that 's usually only something we do if there 's a pattern of harassment . But like I said , we 'll file a report and keep it on record in case you do have a continuing problem . But once we send an officer around to have a word with , her , I do n't think she 'll be othering you again .
STEPHANIE: Thank you , you 've been very helpful .
RAY: I just thank God you 're okay . You are okay , right ?
STEPHANIE: I 'm fine . Ray waits , sensing that there 's more to it .
RAY: Your fine , but
STEPHANIE: I It 's just that I could have gotten her another extension . But I did n't .
RAY: Loo ] . You said the bank had already granted her two extensions .
STEPHANIE: I guess .
RAY: You 're kidding right ?
RHAM JAS: I am Rham Jas . Seer .
STEPHANIE: How do you do ? I 'm Stephanie Brown and this is Ray
RAY: But you probably already knew that . Just kidding . Rham Jas gives Ray a tight smile .
RHAM JAS: How can I help you ?
STEPHANIE: We 'd like to have our fortunes ead . Can you do that ? Read the future ?
RHAM JAS: I have the ability to see certain energies Sometimes these ' energies are a foretoken of things to come . Sometimes not . Sixty dollars , please .
RAY: Sixty dollars ? Is n't that a little steep for this kind of thing ?
RHAM JAS: Then go . There are many who would claim to be seers . But they are not . Although you would pay them little you would receive nothing . If you.are not serious , go .
STEPHANIE: Wait .
RHAM JAS: Platinum card . Very good .
STEPHANIE: Sorry . Rham Jas smiles back .
RHAM JAS: That 's quite all right . So , you wish to know something of you destiny . Very good . We shall see what the fates have in store .
RAY: Freud said destiny was not an act of fate but rather something created by our subconscious to control our conscious choices .
RHAM JAS: That is true . But `` We should not pretend to understand the world only by intellect . ''
RAY: Carl Jung
RHAM JAS: Yes . From his treatise `` Psychological types '' .
RAY: Jung the New Agers ' favorite psychologist .
RHAM JAS: Because he was n't afraid to bring God into the equation .
STEPHANIE: That 's right ! 4
RHAM JAS: But you 've lost something .
STEPHANIE: No . I do n't think so .
RHAM JAS: No . No , you 're right . Something 's een taken from you .
STEPHANIE: No , I-
RHAM JAS: A button .
STEPHANIE: Well , yes ! Some Old Woman
RAY: Well anyone can see she lost a utton . So what ?
STEPHANIE: But Ray , it was very strange . At the bank today . The old woman the one I told you about she plucked the button right from my sleeve .
RAY: Why would she do that ?
RHAM JAS: If you would please , both be quiet .
STEPHANIE: Wait . You saw something . What ?
RHAM JAS: I 'm sorry . I 'm tired and I see it 's ecome quite late . Of course I will efund your money .
STEPHANIE: Tell me . Please . Rham Jas hesitates , then
RHAM JAS: A bad spirit has come upon you .
STEPHANIE: How ?
RHAM JAS: Did you blaspheme the dead while visiting a grave site ?
STEPHANIE: No .
RHAM JAS: Do you play with Ouija board o confer with those who practice the lack arts ?
RAY: What is this ? !
STEPHANIE: No . No , I did n't .
RHAM JAS: Then perhaps someone has cursed you .
STEPHANIE: Who ? 0
RAY: Know what ? That you lost , a button ? 1 He makes some good guesses , stirs you up , leaving you with a lot of questions . And conveniently , his usiness card . C'mon , he 's a scam artist .
STEPHANIE: He did n't want the money . He tried to give the money back .
RAY: In the end , he took it , did n't he ?
STEPHANIE: I guess so .
RAY: So this is him . Got a name ?
STEPHANIE: Uh just `` Kitty '' so far .
RAY: Sure you do n't want me to spend the night ?
STEPHANIE: Do n't tempt me . I 've got to prep a presentation for the morning .
RAY: okay .
STEPHANIE: No . I 'm planning on baking my special cake .
RAY: Sounds good . Try not to stay up too late .
STEPHANIE: Is n't he adorable ?
ELLEN: Let 's hope the landlord thinks so .
STEPHANIE: No , I 'm fine . Have a good time .
ELLEN: Do I look great ? Be honest .
STEPHANIE: But Is n't that Marci 's dress ?
ELLEN: Yeah . And if she calls , tell he not to go bi-polar on me , I'll'get it back to her by tomorrow . Or the next day . Bye ! Ellen exits .
STEPHANIE: Get off me ! Get off !
RAY: So she came to your house ? This is crazy . I 'm calling that police officer . He begins to dial but Stephanie stops him .
STEPHANIE: Ray , you 're not listening . It was n't her . It was something that she sicked on me
RAY: I do n't understand .
STEPHANIE: I did n't tell you the whole story . That old woman after she knocked me down , and pulled the button from my coat , she told me that
RAY: What ?
STEPHANIE: She said that something was coming for me and it did . Ray stares at her with concern .
DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ: Ray , you were right to call me . Never a good idea to be personally involved with your patient .
RAY: What do you think ?
DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ: 1b Medically , she 's fine . She 's just very distraught . She 's displaying some paranoia and a sense of panic . Classic symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder . Probably a result of being assaulted by that old woman .
RAY: How worried should I be ?
DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ: We 'll have to wait and see .
RAY: How you doing ?
STEPHANIE: Better now . At the time it just seemed so real . I 'm so embarrassed .
RAY: Do n't be , you had a terrible day and you.got a little wigged out . It happens .

RAY: I was gon na surprise you , but what the hell . I 've been planning a little trip for us this week end . Saturday morning we 're taking a train to Santa Barbara .
STEPHANIE: Really ?
RAY: My family owns a cabin up there . In , the hills . Overlooking this little iver . We 'll light a fire , drink some champagne and screw our brains out .
STEPHANIE: You sure know how to talk to a girl .
RAY: It 's a chance to just be together . Undisturbed . There 's a lot of stuff I want to talk to you abqut but it never seems to be the right time .
STEPHANIE: Sounds nice .
MRS GANUSH: You shamed mel MATCH CUT to Ray SHAKING her !
RAY: Steph ! Wake Upl
STEPHANIE: Oh my God Oh Godl
RAY: It was just a dream . It 's okay .

STEPHANIE: The old lady . She was here I could n't wake up . Stephanie shakes her head . She ca n't finish .
RAY: Doctor Rangervertz said you could stop by his office during you lunch hour . Stephanie nods .
STU RUBIN: Hi Steph . Just getting here ?
STEPHANIE: What are you , the hall monitor ?
STU RUBIN: Ha ha ! You 're funny , Steph .
STEPHANIE: What do you want ?
STU RUBIN: I need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures .
STEPHANIE: I 've got a lot on my mind . Let 's do it tomorrow .
STU RUBIN: Sure . I 'll just tell Mr. Jacks that you do n't have the time right now . Maybe he can show me .
STEPHANIE: No , no , that 's all right . I 'll do it . Where were we ?
STU RUBIN: We were going over the asset-based lending guidelines .
STEPHANIE: Right . Okay . Let 's say your client is a company that ca n't get traditional bank financing but 10 needs a secured loan . We offer
STU: Yeah ?
STEPHANIE: .uh , we offer several types of asset-based lending which consist of revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts eceivables , their inventory , machinery ,
STU: -and ?
STEPHANIE: And get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk !
MR. JACKS: Stephanie ? Where are you going ?
STEPHANIE: Mrs. Ganush ? No answer . She steps inside .
MRS. GANUSH: I knew you 'd come .
STEPHANIE: Hi . I 'm here because I think I can help you . I can get your house back for you .
MRS. GANUSH: It 's so empty now .
STEPHANIE: So on behalf of the bank I just want to resolve this to you satisfaction . This whole thing got personal and there was really no eason for that . The bank made a mistake and I can fix it for you and in return I 'd like you to- cancel or call off , whatever you you know that thing you did to me . Okay ? No hard feelings . So
MRS. GANUSH: No .
MRS. GANUSH: It was what I wanted before you shamed me . Now I want to see you suffer .
STEPHANIE: Please ! I 've suffered enough !
MRS GANUSH: Not yet !
STEPHANIE: You 're insane ! Just just a crazy old woman ! I do n't even know why I came here !
STEPHANIE: Stu ?
RHAM JAS: What did it sound like .
STEPHANIE: Like shrieking . It was awful . He nods . Closes the book .
RHAM JAS: That would be the Lamia . The `` Black Goat '' .
STEPHANIE: Lamia . Right . That 's the word the old woman used .
RHAM JAS: It is a nasty spirit . A taker of souls . A creature of misfortune fo you and those around you . It is often summoned by the Gypsies fo their dour deeds . On the third day the Lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object .
STEPHANIE: Accursed object ? What object ?
RHAM JAS: Something that the old woman took from you , cursed , then gave back .
STEPHANIE: The button
RHAM JAS: No matter what condition the button is in , you would still be the owner . The Lamia would still come to take you .
STEPHANIE: Take me where ?
STEPHANIE: There 's got to be something I can do .
RHAM JAS: Yes . There are many ways to appease a spirit . The simplest is a blood offering . An animal sacrifice . A small creature would do . You could sacrifice a chicken . It 's all in here
STEPHANIE: No way . I 'm a vegetarian . I 'm a member of PETA , for Christ 's sake . I do n't go around killing animals .
RHAM JAS: You will be surprised what you will e willing to do when the Lamia comes for you .
STEPHANIE: Ellen ? ! But it 's not Ellen .
ELLEN'S VOICE: Steph ?
STEPHANIE: No . Why would there be blood ?
ELLEN: Right there , on your sleeve .
STEPHANIE: That 's just tomato juice . I was inside making a salad and I cut a tomato and I must have gotten it on my sleeve . Ellen gives her roommate a worried look .
ELLEN: Look , Steph , we 're friends so if something 's wrong
STEPHANIE: I had some problems . A situation . But I think everything is going to e good now . Ellen is n't so sure .
ELLEN: Go with the short skirt .
STEPHANIE: What about this one ? She hold up a longer , more formal dress .
ELLEN: Uh uh . That one 's saying `` I 'm trying to impress you with my conservative taste . ''
STEPHANIE: But that 's what I want it to say .
ELLEN: Tell me again the exact words he used .
STEPHANIE: Just that this little cabin would e a great place for us to really connect and that there was something he 'd been meaning to talk about with me .
ELLEN: Oh my god , you are so engaged !
STEPHANIE: What 's wrong ? I
STEPHANIE: But I thought you said that elationship was only physical .
ELLEN: Oh , I 'd never marry a guy like that but I 'd still like him to ask me .
STEPHANIE: Huh .
RAY'S VOICE: Let 's get a look at that dress .
STEPHANIE: You like
RAY: I like .
STEPHANIE: It 's just that I 'm not , some ivy leaguer with an impressive resume . I have a feeling that 's what you folks really want .
RAY: Maybe . But in the end , it 's about what you and I want .
STEPHANIE: Is that so ? Ray gives her a reassuring nod .
RAYMONDL: She kisses her son .
RAY: Stephanie , this is my mother , Trudy , and my Father , George .
TRUDY: How do you do ?
GEORGE: Nice tp meet you , Stephanie .
STEPHANIE: It 's very nice to meet you , too .
GEORGE: Please , come in .
STEPHANIE: Thank you .
STEPHANIE: You have a lovely home .
GEORGE: Thanks . I 'll get us something to drink .
STEPHANIE: I hope you do n't mind . I baked something for you .
TRUDY: It 's lovely . Homemade .
STEPHANIE: It 's a harvest cake .
TRUDY: Harvest cake ? Is'that some kind of cake you make on a farm ?
STEPHANIE: We used to , yeah , when you have a lot of extra duck eggs . Especially ight before spring ; that 's when you get a real dense yolk . Makes for , rich cake . The mother forces a smile .
TRUDY: You must give me the recipe sometime .
STEPHANIE: Sure . It 's easy . The real secret 's in the milk . You want it unpasteurized .
TRUDY: Unclean Uh I mean `` unpasteurized '' ? Is that safe ?
STEPHANIE: Uh huh . And you want that milk still warm . Straight from the cow .
TRUDY: Excuse me while I go find someplace to put this .
GEORGE: Never could understand that damned animal . Hate cats . Trudy returns from the kitchen .
TRUDY: That 's strange . Hecuba 's usually very sweet .
STEPHANIE: That 's okay . I had a cat . I understand .
RAY: What do you mean `` had a cat '' ? What happened to him ?
STEPHANIE: How would I know what happened ? Probably nothing . You know how cats are . They come and they go .
GEORGE: Still keeping up with your coin collection , Ray ?
RAY: I try to . In fact Stephanie just found me a 1925 Indian Head nickel at her bank .
GEORGE: Really ? So , how long have you been working there , Stephanie ?
STEPHANIE: Almost two years now .
TRUDY: The job of a bank teller must be so difficult . I 'd think with all the counting and the repetition , it 'd ecome so tedious .
STEPHANIE: Yes , you 're right . But I 'm not a teller .
TRUDY: Oh ?
RAY: Stephanie 's a loan officer in charge of small business and home loans . And she 's on a fast track for a promotion . Right , Steph ?
STEPHANIE: I 'd like to think so actually , It depends . If I could close this ig account that I 'm working on , it would really help .
GEORGE: Must be a very important loan .
STEPHANIE: It would be the biggest that my anch has ever handled .
GEORGE: How '' d it come to you ?
STEPHANIE: Well , I was reading the Wall Street Journal and found this innovative medical supply company that was interested in expanding but did n't have the liquidity . I met with their CFO and presented a formula for restructuring-some of thei long term debt . It created an environment where I was able to offer them a rather attractive loan
GEORGE: You sure sound like you 've got a lot going for you , Stephanie .
TRUDY: Your mother must be very proud .
STEPHANIE: I suppose . I do n't see her much .
TRUDY: Why is that ?
STEPHANIE: Well , ever since my dad died she does n't talk much . She mostly stays on the farm and keeps to herself . Because There is an awkward silence .
TRUDY: Does your mother have a drinking problem ?
RAY: Cut her some slack , mom , she
STEPHANIE: Yes . I 'm afraid she does .
TRUDY: I 'm sorry . It 's nothing to be ashamed of . And I find your honesty efreshing .
STEPHANIE: Thank you .
TRUDY: ( stage whisper to
STEPHANIE: He found her through the , internet .
RAY: Mors , please .
TRUDY: Stephanie , am I being too tough on Ray ?
STEPHANIE: No . Not at all . That 's what mom 's are for .
TRUDY: Thank you , Stephanie . Maybe I will try that Harvest cake of yours , after all .
STEPHANIE: Excuse me .
RAY: Are you okay ?
TRUDY: Oh ! OH MY GOD !
RAY: I 'm so sorry , Stephanie . I do n't know how that fly got . into your
STEPHANIE: Wait . What 's that sound ?
TRUDY: What sound- ?
STEPHANIE: SHHH ! Listen !
TRUDY: I 'm sorry , I ca n't hear anything .
STEPHANIE: Must be deafer than a post !
RAY: Steph , it 's okay ! There 's nothing there .
STEPHANIE: I I think I 'd better go .
TRUDY: I think that 's best , dear .
RAY: She needs me . Trudy grabs Ray 's arm .
TRUDY: I 'm telling you not to go afte her .
RAY: What did you see in there ?
RAY: Tell me !
STEPHANIE: The thing that 's coming for me . What the old woman sent .
RAY: Listen to me . What you 're going through right now It 's like the doctor said , it 's a stress reaction and
STEPHANIE: No . I wanted to believe that but it 's real , Ray . You just do n't want to open your eyes to it because it threatens you . Because if I 'm right and there is something out there , then you 'd have to throw out everything you teach . And where 'd that leave you ? Like a plow without a mule .
ILENKA: I 'm Ilenka , Sylvia 's granddaughter . Who are you ?
STEPHANIE: Stephanie Brown . I 'm sort of a friend of hers . Actually , I 've een trying to help her with a loan
ILENKA: Wait . I know who you are . Grandma told me you 'd come . You 're the woman from the bank . The one who took her house .
STEPHANIE: It was really the bank that took the house . I just work there . In fact , I tried to help your grandma get-the house back , but my boss would n't let me .
ILENKA: That 's not what happened , is it ? Are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face ?
STEPHANIE: . no .
ILENKA: You used to be a real fat girl , to did n't you ?
STEPHANIE: Yes .
ILENKA: I can tell . You know , you caused my grandma a lot of pain . That house was her pride . When you took that from her , she had nothing left . You 're not welcome here .
STEPHANIE: Okay ! I did it . It was me who denied her the loan . I was trying , to get ahead at work and I should n't have done it . It was wrong .
ILENKA: Damn straight it was wrong .
STEPHANIE: And I 'm ashamed about it . And I 'm going to get down on my hands and knees and beg her to forgive me . She said-that I had n't suffered enough . But now I think she 'll see that I have and then maybe she 'll let me
ILENKA: .make everything all right fo her , is that it ?
STEPHANIE: Yes .
' STEPHANIE: Where is she ?
ILENKA: Still going to make everything all ight ?
STEPHANIE: No , please I needed her to take this thing off me .
ILENKA: It will never come off .
STEPHANIE: You know about it ? Then , please help me . I 'm begging you .
ILENKA: She said you 'd come begging . I only wish she could have lived to see it . The blood drains from Stephanie 's face .
STEPHANIE: Fuck that ! I paid you a hundred and seventy nine dollars for that book !
RHAM JAS: It was a limited printing ! Please control yourself !
STEPHANIE: I did what you said- that blood offering I killed that little kitty deader than Hogan 's goat . Lotta good that did me .
RHAM JAS: We are dealing with elusive and powerful forces . There are no guarantees .
STEPHANIE: Just tell me what to do .
RHAM JAS: We must somehow dissuade the spirit from taking your soul .
STEPHANIE: How ?
RHAM JAS: 1 A seance . And it should be soon . For tomorrow will be the third night
STEPHANIE: Have you done this before ?
RHAM JAS: No . But I know someone . I can arrange what is necessary , but you must understand that everyone involved in this would be taking a great risk with their lives .
STEPHANIE: What would you need from me ?
RHAM JAS: Twenty thousand dollars . Cash . By tomorrow . 5
ELLEN: I need to talk to you .
STEPHANIE: Ellen . I 'm sorry . This a bad time ight now . I got a little emergency and say you got any cash I can orrow ?
ELLEN: No , I do n't . But Steph I
STEPHANIE: what about your credit cards ? What 's your cash advance limit ?
ELLEN: Steph , we need to talk about the cat .

ELLEN: Stephanie . I was in the back yard and I saw where the ground was dug up . I started digging and You uried that little kitty in ou ackyard . What happened ?
STEPHANIE: I did n't want to tell you . It fell out the window and died . It 's sad ,
ELLEN: I found the bloody knife in the ushes .
STEPHANIE: What are you , a cat detective ?
ELLEN: Steph ? I 'm going to tell you this as your friend . There is something seriously wrong with you . Stephanie looks up from , her frantic panting .

RHAM JAS: No . There will be others involved and I can not -ask them to accept such a risk for less . Good night .
STEPHANIE: I 'll take it !
STEPHANIE: Mr. Jacks , this is kind of awkward for me I know it 's not official yet , but I was wondering if I could get a copy of the employment contract for the new position you offered me ?
MR. JACKS: The assistant manager 's position ?
STEPHANIE: Yes . See , one of my family members is having a little emergency which equires me to get them an immediate loan
MR. JACKS: Stephanie There 's a problem . The McPherson deal was cancelled last night .
STEPHANIE: What ? 1
MR. JACKS: Yeah , right after I informed the main branch that we had this big loan pending , ,I find out that they just made their deal over at First National . I got a call in to see , what exactly happened but right now this does n't look too good for you or me . So this assistant manage promotion has been delayed . In fact , I think that with everything that 's been happening , I 'm gon na have to give that job to Stu . Stephanie is devastated .
STEPHANIE: Stu . I see .
MR. JACKS: I 'm sorry . Look . If you 've got family problems . Maybe you should take the day off and sort them out . Stephanie node and exits the bank .
STEPHAINE: But I thought you did n't believe
RAY': I do n't . But you do . I know this is important for , you . she embraces him .
STEPHANIE: Are you coming in ?
STEPHANIE: I know how crazy this must seem . But it will all be over after this I swear to you . He nods . She kisses him .
RAY: I 'll be waiting .
STEPHANIE: We 'll laugh about it on the train , tomorrow .
RAY: t Yeah .
RHAM JAS: Miss Brown . Allow me the pleasure of an introduction A woman rises from the shadows .
STEPHANIE: And ?
STEPHANIE: Yes .
RHAM JAS: You must allow the darkness in . You must invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit..
STEPHANIE: I 'm scared .
RHAM JAS: Yes . Now repeat these words I welcome the dead into my soul
STEPHANIE: I welcome the dead into my soul
RHAM JAS: You must believe it !
SOMETHING UNSEEN: emits a wheezing breath
RHAM JAS: Who now inhabits the body of Shaun San Dena ?
STEPHANIE: It was my manager , Jim Jacks . He was the one ! He
RHAM JAS: Silence ! Lamia , please , surely we can dissuade you from taking this insignificant woman ? Surely she 's not worthy of your greatness . The possessed Shaun San Dena laughs .
GOAT: tricked me !
RHAM JAS: Lamial I command you to leave this
MILOS: Stop the chanting . I beg you !
STEPHANIE: For god 's sake , stop the chanting , it 's killing him ! Rham Jas pushes her aside .
RHAM JAS: You must not stop !
STEPHANIE: No ! Get her off !
10 STEPHANIE: Is it gone ?
STEPHANIE: Let me help you
RHAM JAS: Milos , call an ambulance !

RHAM JAS: Gata , gata , para gata bodhi suaha . Gone , gone , gone beyond . Gone beyond the beyond . Hail the goer .
STEPHANIE: It 's sad
RHAM JAS: Yes .
STEPHANIE: Strange how things work out . She waited years for another chance to overcome the lamia ..and finally she did .
RHAM JAS: No . I 'm afraid you misunderstand . Rham Jas looks at her with pity .
STEPHANIE: What ?
RHAM JAS: The , Lamia can not'be banished by a medium . This was our lesson tonight . I 'm sorry .
RHAM JAS: No . You saw her drive the Lamia from the seance . That is all . It will be back .
STEPHANIE: But then , what am I supposed to do ?
RHAM JAS: Perhaps on this final evening , you should finish up the business of this world . For before the night is through , the Lamia will come fo the owner of the accursed object .
RHAM JAS: Unless , of course you were no longer the owner .
STEPHANIE: No longer the owner ? I do n't understand .
RHAM JAS: The Lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object . Just make a gift of it
STEPHANIE: Why did n't you tell me this efore ? !
RHAM JAS: Because we are speaking of murder .
RAY: Is it over ?
STEPHANIE: Yes . It 's all over .
RAY: Are you okay ? Stephanie nods , catching her breath .
RAY: Are you'still okay about the Santa Barbara trip ?
STEPHANIE: Yes , everything 's fine .
RAY: Okay . Our train leaves tomorrow morning . Seven A.M . When do you want me to pick you up ?
STEPHANIE: It 's better if we meet at the D station . There 's something I 've got to do on the way .
RAY: What envelope ?
STEPHANIE: It 's got to be here !
RAY: Tomorrow 's gon na be a new start for , us . Do n't be late . They kiss and Ray drives off .
STEPHANIE: Banana Boat Sundae .
WAITRESS: Another one ? Stephanie nods absently . The waitress exits .
OLD MAN: What 's this all about ?
STEPHANIE: Just take the envelope and I 'll explain . Please .
RHAM JAS: There are Gypsy blessings that are estowed upon the dead And the Gypsies give gifts to thei departed to curry favor with the deceased soul . Yes . I do believe you could give the curse to someone who has passed on for truly , the soul never dies .
STEPHANIE: .I 'll shove it down her goddamn throat .
STEPHANIE: I 'm giving it back to you .
STEPHANIE: Hey ! Good morning .
SALESWOMAN: I 'm sorry , we 're not open yet .
STEPHANIE: Please . I know what I want . That coat in the window . The Saleswoman considers .
RAY: Is everything okay ?
STEPHANIE: Great .
RAY: I 'm so glad you 're here . There 's so much I 've been meaning to tell you . 0 She takes his hand . 0
STEPHANIE: But let me say this first while I have it straight in my head . You never stopped believing in me . I 'll try and live up to that .
RAY: Did I tell you , you look great ?
STEPHANIE: Thanks . Stephanie models her new coat .
RAY: What 'd you do with your old coat ?
STEPHANIE: I got rid of it . I never want to see it again .
RAY: Too bad , 'cause I just found this .
THE BUTTON: still in his hand .
VOICE: Omnia in duos Duo in Unum Unus in Nihil Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt . Nothing happens .
GALEN: Vide , Magister . There 's something wrong .
ULRICH: I 've just seen something . Something of consequence to you .
GALEN: To me ?
ULRICH: Yes . My own death .
GALEN: Of course .
ULRICH: You have ?
GALEN: Well , almost .
ULRICH: It 's very difficult . Have you committed to memory undying the Codex de Profundis ?
GALEN: The first two chapters .
ULRICH: It 's long . And what about the Ritual of Banishment as prescribed by my late master Balisarius ?
GALEN: To tell the truth , I have n't dared try it . What 's the point , anyway ?
ULRICH: The point ? The point is you do n't know it , and you 're no magician without it . It was my hope to school you , to mold your faculties and wits I still believe you have some talent . Somewhere .
GALEN: I hate books . I hate drill . I want a eal task .
ULRICH: There 's no time now . When I 'm gone , half the powers in the universe will vanish with me . And what 's the use of a few lingering skills if they 're left in the hands of a child ? Listen !
GALEN: I do n't hear anything .
ULRICH: Here , wear this .
GALEN: Voices , singing on the road .
ULRICH: We have visitors !
ULRICH: Looks forbidding enough , do n't you think ?
GALEN: Here are your sticks .
ULRICH: No they 'll think me infirm . You know , Balisarius wore this wheneve he changed lead into gold . He could eally do that , you know . I neve could . Too bad you 'd stand to inherit some real wealth .
GALEN: You 're in a morbid frame of mind . What 's all this about dying ? You do n't even look sick .
ULRICH: You still wearing that amulet ? Good . Do n't lose it . It still belongs to me .
ULRICH: Nunc habeus lux !
VALERIAN: That would be me . We are here on ehalf
ULRICH: I know why you 're here . You 're a delegation from Urland , from beyond Dalvatia . Let 's see the artifacts .
VALERIAN: A bone . Scorched . A rock , fire- lackened . Scales .
ULRICH: All right . How did you come by these ?
VALERIAN: I found them . At the mouth of the lair .
ULRICH: What else ?
VALERIAN: A claw .
ULRICH: That 's no claw . It 's a tooth . By the gods !
VALERIAN: Who else can we turn to ? We all know what we 're dealing with here . This is a basilicok . A cockatrice . A dragon . This is no stag , no bear , no natural creature . This is one of your kind . And only a necromancer such as yourself can rid us of it .
ULRICH: Did you try the Meredydd sisters ? What about Rinbod ? I 've heard it said he killed a dragon once .
VALERIAN: They 're all dead . You 're the only one left .
ULRICH: It 's a long way to Urland .
VALERIAN: Every quarter , upon the solstices and the equinoxes there 's a new victim . Greil , a grizzled peasant , speaks up .
GREIL: My daughter , for one .
OTHER TRAVELERS: My sister cousins
ULRICH: All women ?
VALERIAN: Girls . Virgins , to be exact , chosen y lot .
GALEN: Master , do n't you think
ULRICH: Silence ! He broods for a long time .
VALERIAN: Are you afraid of dragons ?
ULRICH: No . Sorcerers and dragons go back a long long time together . If it were n't for sorcerers , there would n't be any dragons . All right . I 'll go .
GALEN: Look at yourself . How far will you get like that ? A league , two leagues ?
ULRICH: I 'm not worried about the road .
GALEN: Why do n't you wave your hands around and summon up a coach-and-four ?
ULRICH: Do n't mock me . Galen gets up and calls out to the Urlanders .
GALEN: You pilgrims You 're used to lotteries . Why not draw straws to see who 'll be first to carry ironshanks here . This is too much for Hodge .
HODGE: Hold your tongue . If the master 's got a mind to go , he 'll go . Galen approaches the old sorcerer .
GALEN: Send me . You 're always saying I need seasoning . I need a test . Let me go .
ULRICH: You 're not ready .
GALEN: I 'm ready for anything .
ULRICH: Do n't be so hasty . Your time will come .
VALERIAN: Tyrian ! ?
TYRIAN: Good morning , all .
VALERIAN: We 're not afraid of you . Give us the oad .
TYRIAN: Why , the road is yours . All the way to Urland . It 's a long journey , is n't it ? But when you 're in search of a sorcerer , I suppose no distance is too great .
ULRICH: Say nothing .
HODGE: What do you want with us ?
TYRIAN: Well , like my good friends here , I 've come for a bit of black magic . No doubt you 've heard of our troubles at home . This is Cragganmore , is it not ?
HODGE: Aye , this be the place of Ulrich .
TYRIAN: And here we have the mystical presence himself , no ?
HODGE: You 'd best keep your distance and your manners .
TYRIAN: If he 's ready to lay a dragon in its grave , he 's got nothing to fear from me . I 've no more love for that creature than you lot . Nor has the King . But , efore you stir things up , do n't you think it a good idea to see you 've got the right man for the job ?
HODGE: Aha it 's a test you 're looking for . We do n't do tests .
TYRIAN: I 'm sure you do n't . They never do tests and not many real deeds either . Oh , conversation with you grandmother 's shade in a darkened oom , the odd love potion or two ut comes a doubter , well then , it 's the wrong day , the planets are not aligned , the entrails are n't favorable , we do n't do tests .
VALERIAN: We 've got no doubts . We require no test .
HODGE: And you 're not going to get one .
ULRICH: Go to the conjuring room . The iron ox . Fetch me the dagger within . Galen 's eyes widen with alarm .
ULRICH'S VOICE: Where are you , boy ? I 'm waiting .
GALEN: Not this one , was it ?
ULRICH: The very one . Let it fall .
GALEN: Hodge what are you doing ? Hodge quickly conceals the pouch .
HODGE: Just making my farewell , thank you very much .
GALEN: Stand back !
HODGE: Oh , it 's a vale of tears in which we dwell . It does n't matter who you are , a king in his robes , a peasant in his rags , when your time comes , no magic can save you
GALEN: I guess
HODGE: the kindest lord a man could ask for now he 's gone . Ye gods he was fussy about his bath . And you 'd think he could boil his own eggs with the snap of a finger , but no , he had old Hodge do it , of course . Up before five I was , mucking out the cages , slopping the pigs , and never once got so much as a thankyou or a pat on the back I 'm going to miss him .
GALEN: Me too
HODGE: No you do n't . All you care about is the tricks and knavery . Well , you do n't pull any wool over these old eyes . It 'll be a mighty long walk efore you fill his shoes , you mark my word .
GALEN: What 's the matter , Hodge , pack too heavy ? Here .
HODGE: Careful with that !
GALEN: Too cold , is it ?
HODGE: Stop it !
GALEN: Too warm ?
HODGE: Stop it , I say ! Out of respect fo the master !
GALEN: I 've got as much respect for the master as anyone , old man . But then again , I 'm master now .
GREIL: I left my farm with seeds unplanted , calves unborn , nothing but a wife to chase down the strays , and for what ? A funeral , that 's what . He walks up and down behind Valerian .
MALKIN: Hold your tongue , Greil . Sit . Eat .
GREIL: I 'll not sit . I 'll not eat . See you the Great Bear . His tail points east . It 's the equinox . Have you forgotten ? Or rather not think about it ?
VALERIAN: He 's right . I brought us here fo nothing . May the gods help whoever 's daughter it is tonight .
HODGE: Good morrow , good morrow . Peace be with you .
GALEN: Easy now . We mean no harm . We 've een looking for you .
GREIL: Well , you 've found us .
GALEN: More the other way around , I 'd say .
VALERIAN: What do you want ?
GALEN: A few words , that 's all . You were looking for a conjurer .
VALERIAN: He 's dead .
GALEN: Right . Requiscat in pace . Ecce magister novus !
GREIL: How say you ?
GALEN: My lord Ulrich is no longer . All that you asked of him , you may now expect of me . The dangers he would face , I will now conquer . The task he would undertake I will now fulfill . I am Galen Bradwardyn , inheritor of Ulrich 's craft and knowledge , and I am the Sorcerer you seek .
GREIL: Well , that 's a handsome thought , O wizard of wizards . But if there 's one thing our friend Tyrian has shown us , it 's to beware the pig in the poke . Who 's got a dagger ?
HODGE: No tests ! !
GREIL: Call it proof , then .
VALERIAN: We 've seen enough tests .
GREIL: Well I have n't . All I 've seen is death . Death in our families , death on the road , and tonight , death at home .
VALERIAN: What 's come over you , anyway ? Have you lost your wits ?
GREIL: I do n't like it . Young snot-nose comes in here for sport at ou expense . We 're on a fool 's errand , ut we do n't have to listen to this . I do n't want to hear any more about sorcery . I do n't want to hear any more about spells . Valerian hands Galen a plate of food .
VALERIAN: You must be hungry .
GALEN: What 's the matter with him ?
VALERIAN: It 's not just him . It 's all of us . It 's the equinox . They both look up at the moon .
HORSRIK: Close enough ! Bring her out !
RETAINER: Plowman ! The family Plowman !
HORSRIK: the family Plowman to be free of obligations , taxations , levys and imposts for a period not to exceed five years
MAN: There . I see them .
TYRIAN: Who 's that old man ?
MAN: Where ? Which one ?
TYRIAN: That one . That 's the man from Cragganmore . Now what 's he doing here ?
MAN: Filling in for the chief , I reckon .
TYRIAN: What a pity .
GALEN: What have you got there ?
HODGE: None of your business .
GALEN: A little gold , eh ? What do you say I change it into lead ?
HODGE: Save your jokes for someone else . Me , I do n't care for braggarts .
GALEN: I 'm no fraud .
HODGE: Call it fool then . Upstart . Whateve pleases you .
GALEN: Hodge , nobody forced you to come along .
HODGE: Oh , I 'm here of my own free will , all right . We each do the master 's idding in our own way .
GALEN: Well , if he told you I needed wetnursing , why do n't you just turn yourself around and go back home . Hodge snorts and fusses with his pack .
HODGE: Home , is it ? You 've seen to that , have n't you ? Gone to seed , I 'd say He glances over and discovers Galen missing .
GALEN: You 're too far behind us . Come on out .
VALERIAN: You go ahead , I 'll catch up .
GALEN: Not a good idea to get separated . Let 's go .
VALERIAN: Right . I 'll be along .
GALEN: By the gods ! Valerian is pale and frightened .
VALERIAN: Stay away .
GALEN: I 'm not going to say anything .
VALERIAN: I do n't blame you . I was stupid . Careless . A silly woman !
GALEN: Take it easy . I knew the moment I saw you . I 've known the whole time .
VALERIAN: You never knew a thing . No one knew . Not since I was born . Go on , run off and tell them . It 'll make a great story .
GALEN: Do n't worry . No one 's going to find out . Just tell me why ?
VALERIAN: Ask my father . They finish dressing in silence . Finally
GALEN: The lottery ! Daughters are chosen , ut sons are not !
VALERIAN: That 's right . Unless you have plenty of gold or property .
GALEN: What do you mean ?
VALERIAN: If you 're rich enough , your name never goes in . My father is poor . So are a lot of fathers .
GALEN: No !
GALEN: No !
HODGE: Galen ? Can you hear me ?
GALEN: I hear you .
HODGE: You know , somebody shot me , but I can still talk . There 's something that has to be done .
GALEN: I know .
HODGE: Not that cockatrice . Ulrich 's ashes . Here .
GALEN: What are you doing with this , Hodge ?
HODGE: burning water He dies . Galen frees himself from his grasp .
GALEN: Hodge , do n't die . Listen to me . You 're not going to die .
GREIL: Urland !
VALERIAN: Come on . Do n't dawdle here . Galen falls into step with her .
GALEN: The whole kingdom like this ?
VALERIAN: No . We 're near the lair . Keep moving . Galen looks around with new interest .
GALEN: Where ?
VALERIAN: Over there . Does n't matter . We 're in no danger if we just pass through quickly .
GALEN: I see it . Let 's have a look .
VALERIAN: No ! But Galen is already toiling up the incline .
GREIL: Look , you do n't have to do this . We know you 're a fine young magician . None better . There 's no need to prove it to us .
GALEN: Are there other entrances ?
VALERIAN: No . One 's enough .
GREIL: Come on . The road 's this way . We 'll tell everybody how close you got .
GALEN: No smoke . How do you know it 's in there ?
GREIL: Do n't be a fool . Come away now and live to tell about it .
VALERIAN: Go ahead ! You 're going to die ! What a fine trick that will be ! But Galen is lost in the gloom . She flees .
GALEN: Now , great mountain , hear my command Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum draconis ! Evanescat latibulum draconis !
BROTHER JACOPUS: Now are you cleansed of your sins ! Now are you born again , purified in spirit , into the fellowship of Jesus Christ !
SIMON: Welcome back , my son .
VALERIAN: Father , what are you doing ? Have you all lost your minds ?
SIMON: Some have .
VALERIAN: And they listen ?
SIMON: Shh ! They think this a holy place , a tabernacle .
VALERIAN: This is the granary . What kind of welcome is this ? I 've got news of the sorcerer and news of the dragon .
SIMON: You were brave to go , you and you friends . But nobody cares . Listen he knows what they want to hear .
BROTHER JACOPUS: The man who walks with Christ is not a man to fear a dragon Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil ! You say you are preyed upon by a foul beast . Yes , but what is the nature of this beast ? It comes to you on bat 's wings and clawed feet , does it not ? It breathes fire , does it not ? And it lives under ground . This is no dragon . This is Lucifer !
VOICE: Whoever it is , he 's dead .
BROTHER JACOPUS: Nay , brother ! It is not as easy as that . Allegiance to Christ , to be sure , but also prayer and confession . These are the arms by which Satan may be put down .
GALEN: You 're talking about superstition , friend . None of that has anything to do with what I , Galen , have already achieved . He marches to the center of the gathering .
SIMON: You brought this stranger ?
VALERIAN: Ulrich 's apprentice . He 's a braggart , ut it does n't matter .
GALEN: People of Urland ! Send a messenge to the king . Vermithrax is dead . Crushed by the power of the moon and the stars ! Laid low by ancient wisdom . Dropped into the Abyss by mystical practice .
BROTHER JACOPUS: Spoken like a pagan . Every word as eprobate as it is false ! Solum in hoc signo vinces !
GALEN: Nihil plus mysterium !
BROTHER JACOPUS: Praise God ! Blessed is he that is humble before the Lord !
VALERIAN: Your god had nothing to do with it .
MALKIN: We saw it with our own eyes . He flew to the mountain top . He was a bird . He brought forth lightning . I saw it .
SIMON: Put that away . What if you were seen ?
VALERIAN: I 'm going to be seen . I want to be seen . Tonight the world finds out that you never had a son .
SIMON: No , you must n't do that . It 's too soon . We 've got to think about this , we 've got to make a plan .
VALERIAN: Father the danger is over .
SIMON: I know . What am I going to say to my friends who still mourn for thei lost girls .
VALERIAN: You 'll say you did what you had to . This is a time for celebration and forgiveness .
GALEN: Looks like you 've been up to a little sorcery yourself . Valerian does n't know what to say .
VALERIAN: I think it was much easier being a oy .
SIMON: The damnedest thing is , she was twice the man of anyone else in the village . Now she 's twice the woman .
GREIL: Would that I had been as clever as her father .
SIMON: Come now , Greil . Do n't begrudge a life spared .
GREIL: I begrudge nothing . But I wonder at what we have seen and how it was done .
SIMON: You were there .
GREIL: I saw what I saw . But this jack-anapes was barely ready to carry his master 's chamberpot . Is n't it strange that at the very moment the beast is put down we should have a holy man here in the village ?
SIMON: You do n't believe that superstitious Christian rot , do you ?
GREIL: It is said God works his wonders in mysterious ways .
TYRIAN: A celebration ! Do n't stop on my account . You musicians , more music !
MALKIN: What would you have of us then ?
TYRIAN: Not a thing . It 's this one . The King would meet our new benefacto and offer his gratitude to the man who succeeded where so many have failed .
GALEN: What sort of gratitude ? A knife in the belly ? An arrow in the back ?
TYRIAN: My young friend , I 'd as soon dispatch you as I did the others , and for the same reason . But his Majesty would like a cozy chat , and commands otherwise .
VALERIAN: Do n't go , Galen . Cast a spell and turn them into toads . It should be easy ; that 's what they are .
TYRIAN: Well , well still plenty of cheek under those skirts , it seems .
GALEN: Do n't worry . I 'll be back .
GALEN: One of the best things about the water here in Urland is that there 's so much of it look at that !
KING: Enough ! That 's fine .
GALEN: Wait , it 'll rise now .
KING: Do n't bother . Not necessary .
GALEN: Yes .
KING: I see . And having rendered such unique service to our kingdom , what would you claim as a reward ?
GALEN: Please no payment . I have always found magical practice to be its own eward . I seek only some yet greate challenge .
KING: Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric ? Of course not , you were n't even born . He was my brother , a great King and a valiant man-at-arms . When he ascended to the throne , the dragon was unbridled . No one knew where it might strike next . So he brought forth his broadsword and his spear , assembled a company of his best fighters and went out to do battle . He was never seen again . But his attack provoked the most terrible eprisals whole villages incinerated , entire crops burned . Death , famine , horrible .
GALEN: I was invited .
KING: Not by me . Did you ever consider the consequences of failure ?
GALEN: What failure ? What 's the matter with you people ? You want the dragon back ?
KING: Then the beast is dead ?
GALEN: Yes , of course . Dead .
KING: We shall see .
TYRIAN: Thank you .
GALEN: Cubiculum gravis aperat !
VOICE: Salve , magistrum iuvenilum .
ELSPETH: I 've studied Latin . Greek , too . Me appelo Elspeth , filia regis .
GALEN: How do you do .
ELSPETH: Please do n't think ill of us . My father is a wonderful man , a wise man . The lottery was his idea .
GALEN: I see .
ELSPETH: You do n't understand . From the moment it began , the dragon was tame . The kingdom prospered .
GALEN: And only a few had to be sacrificed .
ELSPETH: Yes , that 's true . Is n't it bette that a few should die that many might live ?
GALEN: Depends on who does the dying .
ELSPETH: Oh , but we all take our chances . My father is a just man . My name is entered on the lists , along with every other young
GALEN: Virgin ?
ELSPETH: Maiden .
GALEN: If you say so .
ELSPETH: What do you mean ?
GALEN: Nothing .
ELSPETH: I 've participated in every drawing since I came of age .
GALEN: Maybe .
ELSPETH: It 's true . You do n't believe me . You think I 'm lying . Well I 'm not .
GALEN: I 'm sorry . I heard a rumor . Families with money , that sort of thing .
ELSPETH: Do n't listen to rumors . They 're lies . I have to go now .
GALEN: Wait how long do I have to stay in here ?
ELSPETH: Until we know . Not long . Goodbye . Vale . Dormi bene . She slips away down the corridor .
KING: That 's enough . Let 's not be greedy here .
ELSPETH: Father ?
KING: Not now . Tyrian , remove all but one ar . We 'll try it one at a time .
ELSPETH: Father did you know that some families have paid bribes to stay out of the lottery ? The King and Tyrian glance up at her .
KING: Nonsense . By the power of this amulet , justly wielded by my hand in accordance with the laws of Urland , now lead be thou gold .
ELSPETH: Have you ever kept my name off the lottery list ?
KING: That 'll be all , Tyrian . You may withdraw .
ELSPETH: Answer my question am I not exposed to the same risk as every other man 's daughter ?
KING: Your father loves you very much . Elspeth sways in dismay .
ELSPETH: It 's true ! What have you done to me ! ?
KING: Who fills your head with such ideas ?
TYRIAN: You little meddler ! It 's alive !
TYRIAN: Close the main gate ! Quick !
TYRIAN: Get him ! Stab the horse !
KING: Tyrian ! Tyrian !
BROTHER JACOPUS: Listen to me , my brethren . The moment of our fear is the moment of ou triumph . This is a sign from God . Follow me , and our faith will send this creature straight to hell .
GREIL: You call yourselves Christians ?
BROTHER JACOPUS: The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want . Thou makest me to lie down in green pastures . Thy rod and staff they comfort me
BROTHER JACOPUS: for Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen .
MAN: Get away , you little bastard . We 've had enough help from you .
WOMAN: This is your doing !
BURLIES: Get him ! He 's back !
GALEN: Greil help !
GREIL: May the Lord forgive you for what you have done .
GALEN: It 's me . Are you hurt ?
VALERIAN: Where have you been ? Does n't matter listen Quick ! Make it rain . That 'll put the fire out .
GALEN: I ca n't .
VALERIAN: Then get the animals back . They 're all running loose . There 's people een hurt . Stop their pain . You can cure them . And we 'll need food
GALEN: I ca n't do it .
VALERIAN: What ? Why not ?
GALEN: I just ca n't .
VALERIAN: But you 're a sorcerer .
GALEN: I 'm no sorcerer . Whatever power I might have had , it 's gone .
VALERIAN: It ca n't be !
GALEN: I know I 'm an imposter . A fraud . A fake . I 'm sorry
VALERIAN: You 're sorry ? ! Listen to that ! The damn thing is loose , we 're all on fire and you 're sorry !
TYRIAN: Where is he ?
VALERIAN: Not here . I ca n't help you .
VALERIAN: You too ?
MALKIN: Damn right .
TYRIAN: As the proud new father of an eligible daughter who was some-how overlooked all these years , it may interest you to know that the King has called fo a new lottery .
SIMON: But it 's months til the solstice .
TYRIAN: In view of what 's happened , we all know what 's required .
SIMON: I 've never taken part in your cursed lottery , and I 'll have nothing to do with it now .
TYRIAN: You were very clever . But she 'll take part , like all the rest . No exceptions .
HENCHMAN: Nothing . If he was here , he 's gone now .
SIMON: All right . I know what you want . How much ?
TYRIAN: Are you offering me a bribe ?
SIMON: Yes .
TYRIAN: Do n't waste your time . You could never afford it .
GALEN: Smith have you ever forged a weapon ?
GALEN: These are your sharpest ?
SIMON: Even Tyrian carries one of these . Galen hefts it dubiously .
GALEN: It 's sharp but it 's not sharp enough .
VALERIAN: Not sharp enough for what ?
GALEN: For what I 'm going to do with it .
VALERIAN: Nothing 's that sharp .
SIMON: The best I ever made . Valerian is as awed as Galen .
VALERIAN: It 's beautiful .
SIMON: Do n't do that ! Girl-child , when you were born I knew I had to do something , so I set about the task of fashioning an extraordinary weapon I had the skill to make it but not the nerve to use it .
VALERIAN: I 'm thankful for that . No man should choose a senseless death .
GALEN: Valerian , this is n't just for you sake .
VALERIAN: I do n't care . It does n't matter . What you want to kill is n't flesh and blood .
SIMON: Oh , it 'll bleed , all right .
VALERIAN: How do you know ? No one 's so much as even scratched it .
GALEN: I 'll need the amulet .
VALERIAN: Look at her . The Princess .
GALEN: I know . We 've met .
HORSRIK: People of Urland whereas the peace of the kingdom has been disrupted by the mischief of an interloper ; and whereas this interloper being fled ; now therefore , his majesty the King hereby proclaims the sum of thirty ducats to be paid to anyone producing the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn , fraud enchanter , to our satisfaction .
CROWD: Stir the tiles ! Stir the tiles !
HORSRIK: Now , my countrymen , hear me behold , for I am chosen . I shall die that many may live . I shall lay down my life for family and fellows . I shall go to my grave for the love of ou King and his wise policy . And my name is
CROWD: The name ! The name !
KING: Read the name .
HORSRIK: The name is Princess Elspeth Ulfilas , filia regis .
KING: That 's not the name . It 's been misread . Valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy .
VALERIAN: There 's no mistake ! The name 's been chosen let it stand !
KING: No , the good Horsrik has misspoke himself . In fairness to this individual , whose name I ca n't make out , we 'll destroy this tile .
VALERIAN: No ! What better name than your own kin ? At last we see justice done !
KING: Silence ! We will have a new choosing . I will draw the name myself .
CROWD: Let it stand ! Let it stand !
ELSPETH: The name is as you heard it and as Horsrik read it Elspeth .
KING: The lottery is invalid . Another and another . What treachery is this ?
ELSPETH: Hear me , good people ! It is true , that my name appears on many of the lots . This does not falsify the drawing , it certifies it ! I have learned that my name has been kept from jeopardy in all the drawings in the past . So I have put my name among the rest many times once for each isk that , over the years , you took and I did not .
KING: Do n't go to all that trouble .
GALEN: I 'm unarmed . If you want a fight , at least give me a weapon .
TYRIAN: I think not !
KING: Stop ! Do n't harm him . And you do n't run away please
TYRIAN: Sire !
KING: He shall have it . It 's my daughter . Save her , I beg you .
GREIL: Holy of holies he did not die in vain . Can you hear me , brothers ?
MALKIN: We hear you , Greil .
GREIL: Well and good , but I 'm Greil no longer . Call me Gregorius , after the Bishop of Rome . Malkin and the others stop to listen .
GREIL: Of what avail is magic ? The old gods died with our daughters . From whence comest my help ? My help comest from the Lord !
SIMON: Good and hot .
GALEN: Do n't bother . That 's not the kind of fire we need .
SIMON: An edge like no other on this earth .
GALEN: Well done , Simon . Thank you .
SIMON: I 'll say goodbye to Valerian fo you . I 'm sorry she 's not here , but you know how she is .
GALEN: I understand .
SIMON: Fare thee well .
VALERIAN: Galen .
GALEN: Thank you .
VALERIAN: Another thing . That thing is n't alone up there . There 's little ones . Young , I think . I do n't know how many .
GALEN: Hatchlings . They 'll have to be killed too . Anything else ?
VALERIAN: You 're in love , are n't you ?
GALEN: Yes .
VALERIAN: That 's all right . I understand . She 's very beautiful , very brave .
GALEN: Who is ? What do you mean ?
VALERIAN: Your Princess . But I do n't care . It does n't change the way I feel . Listen to me , Galen Bradwardyn , sorcerer 's apprentice ; you 're going to be dead , the dragon will be worse than ever , there will be more lotteries , and I 'm not a boy any more .
GALEN: And you 'll be eligible because
VALERIAN: Because I 'm still a virgin , and I want you to do something about it .
GALEN: I am in love . But not with the Princess .
HORSRIK: Now be it known throughout the kingdom , that the Princess , having een chosen by a deed of fortune and destiny
GALEN: Be gone !
HORSRIK: I declare these proceedings duly ordained
TYRIAN: I knew I 'd find you here . Well , I 'm not as sentimental as some . The kingdom , every one of us , need this sacrifice . If you intend to interfere , you 'll have to kill me .
GALEN: I 've got plenty of reasons to kill you that have nothing to do with this sacrifice .
TYRIAN: Most impressive . Can you use it ? Elspeth twists around in her chains .
ELSPETH: Let it be ! Please ! Tyrian is right it 's our only hope !
TYRIAN: In a trice ! This is no swords-man .
GALEN: Run ! Get out of here !
TYRIAN: You 've failed , my friend , and I thank the gods for it . Come out from behind that post .
GALEN: Elspeth !
VALERIAN: You know what we have to do . We have to leave Urland . He winces in pain .
SIMON: She 's right . What kind of a life could you have here ? It 's too late for me , but you 're young enough . You know what I think ? Magic is dying out , fading from the world . But that makes me happy . That means the dragon will be dying too .
VALERIAN: What 's that ?
GALEN: Nothing . I was just thinking poo Hodge .
VALERIAN: How 's your leg ?
GALEN: Hurts . That thing was small , but its teeth were sharp .
VALERIAN: At least you killed it . You got all the young . This is small consolation , and Galen sighs .
GALEN: But the big one 's alive . Somewhere down in that burning lake .
VALERIAN: Do n't think about it . You had you fight , and you 're still here . That 's more than anyone else can say . Let 's think about what lies ahead .
VALERIAN: What are you doing ?
GALEN: You old trickster ! The burning water ! The lake of fire !
VALERIAN: Galen , what are you saying ? He regards her with astonishment .
GALEN: He had it planned . He knew this was going to happen .
VALERIAN: Who did ? What happened ?
GALEN: We 've got to go back , I want to talk to him !
VALERIAN: Where are you going ? She hurries after him .
GREIL: The Church is mother to us all . Not just one lonely orphan who has lost his way , not just a few , but all of us that believeth in Him . When enough voices come together in prayer , He shall hear , we shall live and the east shall die .
VALERIAN: Galen , stop ! Please , I beg you !
GALEN: He could n't walk he knew he could n't make the journey . So he had us make the journey for him ! Do n't you see ?
VALERIAN: No ! She tackles him again .
GALEN: What ? Why ? No you 're not , this is my job . Absolutely not .
VALERIAN: I 'm not afraid . And you 're not going to stop me . After all I 've been a man longer than you have .
GALEN: Stay close .
VALERIAN: What 's that ?
GALEN: Never mind . Come on .
VALERIAN: Galen ? Galen ? Where are you ?
GALEN: Ex favilla , vita nova !
GREIL: Be calm . He watcheth over us ! And this is His sign ! Let us pray ! Ou Father who art in heaven
GALEN: Ulrich ! Magister ! Over here ! I can see you ! Over here !
ULRICH: Not so loud . I 'm not deaf , you know .
GALEN: Wonder of wonders you 're back ! I thank the powers that made me !
ULRICH: Glad to see you , too . You did n't ing along anything to eat , by any chance ?
GALEN: Food ?
ULRICH: No ? Oh well , no time anyway .
ULRICH: Come along . There 's much to be done .
GALEN: Wait , I have something to tell you .
ULRICH: It can wait .
GALEN: No it ca n't . Listen I thought I was a sorcerer but I was n't . I thought I had power but I did n't . I thought I was you but I 'm not .
ULRICH: Well said . Now hurry .
VALERIAN: Galen !
ULRICH: Where 's my amulet ? Give it to me , please .
ULRICH: Do n't be afraid . You have served me with great courage . Now you must show me you have even more .
GALEN: Anything !
ULRICH: You must destroy the amulet , and me along with it .
GALEN: No !
ULRICH: You brought me from the flames , you must send me back .
GALEN: I ca n't .
ULRICH: When the time comes , you 'll understand . Here .
ULRICH: I know what you 're thinking . You have learned much and done well . Do n't worry , you wo n't need it any more .
GREIL: Make haste , brother . He dips Simon 's head under water .
ULRICH: Nimbus ! Tempestas ! Fulmen !
VALERIAN: Here . Do as he said . Smash it .
GALEN: Not if it means killing him .
VALERIAN: You heard what he said .
GALEN: No ! You ca n't !
ULRICH: Galen !
GREIL: Let us pray .
HORSRIK: All hail Casiodorus Rex Dragon slayer !
VALERIAN: You want to rest ?
GALEN: No . I 'm fine .
VALERIAN: You miss Ulricn .
GALEN: Yes .
VALERIAN: And the amulet .
GALEN: That too .
VALERIAN: Not me . I 'm glad it 's gone . I 'm glad you did what you did . You may not be a sorcerer , Galen , ut I love you anyway . I do n't regret anything that happened . I just wish
GALEN: Yes ?
VALERIAN: that we had a horse .
GALEN: A horse .
VALERIAN: Did you ! ?
GALEN: No . It must have been wandering loose . Or wild .
VALERIAN: Wait a minute . I just wished for a horse and here it is .
GALEN: You do n't want to wish it gone , do you ?

BERNIE ROSE: I already gave you my advice . You should have taken your money and left this guy alone .
NINO: It 's not that simple , Bernie .

COOK: Mr. Paolozzi , I owe you this guy . Just give me the okay and I 'll -
BERNIE ROSE: You like taking orders , go shut the blinds . He looks at Cook 's broken hands .

BERNIE ROSE: Well , now you fucked up I am involved . Anyone finds out you stole from the family they 'll kill both of us -
NINO: What family ? These fucks still call me a kike to my face . I 'm fifty nine years old , they pinch my cheek , treat me like a fuckin ' kid . They 're the reason we left New York in the first place . Decrepit old men waving us over to their dinner and domino tables to complain .
BERNIE ROSE: Those old men gave us the funds to move out here .
NINO: And I made them a lotta money . I made you a lotta money too He stares at Bernie , genuinely indignant now .

BERNIE ROSE: The money always flows up , Izzy . You know that .
NINO: That 's why this driver has to go . Him , and maybe your friend Shannon , are the only two people who can tie me to the robbery .
BERNIE ROSE: What about this prick ? He does n't even bother to look at Cook .
COOK: Mr. Paolozzi -

BERNIE ROSE: It 's bad luck . Two thousand heists in this city a year , he had to pick the wrong one .
SHANNON: He tried to put it right .
BERNIE ROSE: Picked the wrong guy for that too . My partner 's a belligerent asshole with his ack against the wall He stops , facing Shannon .
SHANNON: Probably across the border by now . Mexico . Belize . That 's where I 'd go Bernie Rose smiles , not believing a word .
BERNIE ROSE: He just walked out on you after everything you 've done for him , took all the money ?
SHANNON: That 's gratitude , I guess .
BERNIE ROSE: I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been friends ? Since we were six . Only Jews in a neighborhood of wops . Long as I can emember he was getting me into trouble and I was getting him out of scrapes He looks almost apologetic .

BERNIE ROSE: You know , it 's too bad , I was getting excited about our race team , having my name all over the car . I think we could have made something of this business

CANDY: Close'm'close'm'close'm'close . Suddenly Milton 's head jerks toward the door . His hand shoots beneath his pillow as The door BURSTS OPEN !
MILTON: Thanks . Apparently I shot my wad . Milton stares down into Candy 's face .
CANDY: Jesus Christ . You 're the best fuck I 've ever had . Piper crosses to the adjoining room .
PIPER: Aw , hell .
MILTON: I definitely got their attention .
PIPER: What . The fuck ? You know these people ? Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder .
MILTON: Come on . There are probably more .
JONAH KING: Shhhh . Do n't cry little precious . FF-FFUMP ! Two doors shut . Jonah King turns , freezes .
ACCOUNTANT: Troopers . Remember why we 're here .
PIPER: Milton , I 'm serious ! I want some answers !

PIPER: What are you doing ? !
MILTON: Have to stop him

MILTON: You got ta patch me up . I 'll drive .
PIPER: They were trying to kill us !
MILTON: Yes .
PIPER: They were trying to kill you .
MILTON: Yes .
MILTON: Christ . Piper 's attention is still on the dead cops .
PIPER: Christ is right ! They start shooting with no warning ? ! What are you , a murderer ? You escape from prison or something ? The GTO tears onto the highway !
MILTON: Both . Piper raises the gun , points it at Milton .
PIPER: What have you gotten me into ? I shouldI shouldJesus , I just killed a cop ! I 'm going to prison . Give me one good reason I should n't shoot you in the face .

MILTON: In the back seat . Now .
PIPER: What ? Why ?
MILTON: Now !
ACCOUNTANT: It 's over , Milton . Stop the car .
MILTON: I ca n't do that .
ACCOUNTANT: Really ? What makes you think you have a choice ?
MILTON: I got something I got ta do first .
ACCOUNTANT: Then you should have done it a long time ago .
MILTON: I did n't have to do it a long time ago !
ACCOUNTANT: Milton , I will kill that nice woman in the backseat to get to you .
MILTON: I wo n't let you do that .
ACCOUNTANT: Again . What makes you think you have a choice ?
TO PIPER: Now .
MILTON: This does . The Accountant 's eyes widen .
PIPER: He 's not one of the ones who took your granddaughter , is he ?
MILTON: Someone else .
PIPER: Is there anyone not trying to kill you ?
MILTON: My daughter got mixed up with the son of a bitch right out of college .
PIPER: She knew him ? She knew Jonah King , the man they think killed She stops herself .
MILTON: She knew him . The world was in a fuckin tailspin and King was preaching quiet revolution .
PIPER: Jonah King was into voodoo ? Milton reloads the 357 , slowly , methodically .
MILTON: Voodoo , the occult , not much he was n't into . When she told him she was leaving , he helped her pack . Gassed up her car . Cooked her a hot meal . Then while she slept he oke her leg in three places with a tire iron .
PIPER: Jesus .
MILTON: She learned her lessen . Was a good little follower for eighteen months . That 's when they met with some witch doctor bullshit artist in Chinatown . It was Chinese New Year so the place was wall to wall slants . She saw her chance , stabbed Jonah in the face with a souvenir corkscrew and vanished into the crowd .
PIPER: Milton . Your daughter was in a cult for two years and you did n't know ? Why did n't you help her ?
MILTON: I did n't find out about any of this untiluntil I got locked up . Only two bullets left . He SNAPS the gun shut . Shoves it into his duffle .
PIPER: Not gon na reload ?
MILTON: Only had three bullets to begin
PIPER: Milton .
PIPER: That 's his truck .
MILTON: Stay put . I wo n't be long .
MILTON'S POV: The cab is empty . Somewhere near , we hear a MUFFLED BABY 'S CRY .
PIPER: Hey ! Let me go , fucker !
MILTON: Do n't Piper ! Let her go . She 's a pain in the ass you do n't want . Milton still has n't let go of his shotgun .
JONAH KING: Milton , is n't it ? Why are you here ? Why are you making such a fuss ?
MILTON: Is n't that obvious , you sick fuck ? I 'm here for her . Milton gestures toward the baby .
JONAH KING: What 's obvious is that you clearly abandoned your daughter .
MILTON: But sacrificing her under the full fuckin moon , that 's okay ?
JONAH KING: Okay ? Milton , your granddaughter is unbelievably blessed . Look around . The world 's on fire . Companies own our governments and the people suffer . Daily . And will continue to suffer until change comes . And change will come . Thanks to you granddaughter , Milton . She will open the door to a new world order .
MILTON: Your BS do n't work on me . You killed my daughter but I wo n't let you kill my grandbaby .

BUSINESS WOMAM: Stay down ! That 's impossible !
TATTOO: You shot him in the face ! He ca n't
JONAH KING: Do n't you see ? We stand at the crossroads ! Did you think we would just idly change the world ? The forces of evil challenge us ! This is wonderful ! We show ourselves to be worthy . I 'm so very proud of each one of you . Tattoo and Business Woman beam .
IN REARVIEW: The front end of a fast approaching vehicle !
THROUGH WINDSHIELD: The RV pulls off the road to the left .
MILTON: Shit ! He SLAMS on his brakes .
PIPER: Oops .
JONAH KING: I am patient and forgiving , but that was wrong of you . He turns to her .
PIPER: Great . Between now and then . I 'm ' a fuck you up . He takes a step and swings a punch .
MILTON: Son of a bitch .
PIPER: Give me the baby and I 'll make the pain go away .
JONAH KING: Goodbye , child .

MILTON: Powers . It 's all bullshit .
PIPER: No , Milton . It 's real . Ghosts , UFOs , bigfoot , that 's the bullshit . The Devil and demons ? Once those doors are opened you 're fucked . Milton rolls his one good eye .
MILTON: I used to know a guy lived out this way . You got one of them portable phones ?
PIPER: Portable phones ? You mean a cell phone ? Yeah , in my bag .
HIS POV: He 's crawling toward the Station Wagon . Someonesomewhereis HUMMING Wig turns , squints .
ACCOUNTANT: Scorcher today , huh ?
PIPER: Lem me know if I hurt you .
MILTON: Do what you got ta do . You get used to the pain .
PIPER: There . That 's better .
PIPER: Why does everyone keep saying that ?
WEBSTER: Because he IS dead . Sure as shit supposed to be anyway .
MILTON: Webster , you gon na yank that .44 o just keep stroking it ?
WEBSTER: That depends . How 's this possible ?
MILTON: You heard about my daughter ?
SOFTENS SLIGHTLY: I did .
MILTON: Then you know why I 'm back .
PIPER: Back ? Back from where ? What . The Fuck . Are you two talking about ? !
WEBSTER: It true they took the little one ? Milton nods .
ROOKIE: Sarge ! Sarge look at this !

ROOKIE: Sarge ! It 's less than twenty feet from the victims !
SARGE: And less than three feet from the ash bin .
ROOKIE: Hey !
ROOKIE: You ! You ca n't be here ! Rookie rushes forward .
SARGE: Rookie !
ROOKIE: Sarge , this joker ca n't just stomp around the crime scene . Sarge catches up , nods with respect to Cap .
SARGE: Captain . Sorry about that . Cap looks up then stares at Rookie 's feet .
CAP: One of yours ?
SARGE: Yessir , I wo n't let it happen again .
CAP: Get him out of here .
SARGE: Cap , he 's green , that 's all .
CAP: He 's standing on evidence .
UNIFORMED OFFICER: Cap ! We got a live one .

CANDY: Hehe killed them . He killed all of them .
CAP: Who did ?
CANDY: No . You do n't understand , we was fuckin ' . He killed them while we was fuckin ' . That 's never happened to me efore , has it happened to you ? Cap turns to Sarge who is standing near .
CAP: Let 's get a shrink in here too .
WEBSTER: Engine 's shot to hell .
PIPER: Can you fix it ?
PIPER: I don'thow is this possible ?
WEBSTER: He loved his daughter .
PIPER: Lots of daddy 's love thei daughters , does n't explain shattering reality .
WEBSTER: That one loved his little girl enough to make her hate him . Like Timmy yellin ' at Lassie to go home ? Piper looks even more confused .
PIPER: Obviously you got out . Webster glances at Milton for a moment .
WEBSTER: The bastards we were workin ' for , they were gon na kill us when the job was done .
WEBSTER: Being a daddy was n't the only thing Milton was good at . Sumbitch was good at being a friend .
MILTON: You know the pain and suffering ai n't the worse part , right ? That 's what they tell ya , what they want you to believe . But it 's all a big fuckin lie . Nosir , worst part 's the goddamn video feed . Webster and Piper exchange a glance .

HAROLD: `` Who would you pick to be president , dead or alive ? '' PAN OVER to Molly Howard .
MOLLY: Uh , Emperor Hirohito .
LESLIE: Brett Favre !
BECKY: My mother , kcause she could solve world hunger with one of her blue- ibbon rhubarb pies , create world peace with one of her prayers and still find time to look eautifulfor my dad , Lester Leeman .
JOHN: D-do you like to swim ?
LISA: Oh-yah , I love to swim . When I was in New York , I met Greg Louganis at one-a my brothers ' shows

LESLIE: Oh-yah , really nervous . It 's been about two months . I have n't told my oyfriend yet . How did you know ?
BECKY: There are eight thousand sequins and fifteen hundred beads on the skirt , alone . My mom and Mrs. Lopez make it . She 's one of my father 's many Mexican workers he lifts from the poverty they know in Mexico .
AMBER: Yah-my ma 's clothes all melted onto mine forming like this big polyeste meteor in our closet , y'know ? But , in some kinda weird miracle , our neighbo oy , Kenny Johanson , found my tap costume on the roof-a their traile while he was settin ' coon traps fo his dad . Here 's the weird part . It was still on the hanger .
TESS: And , uh , this is my lucky bolt . They think it fell from a DC-10 . The doctor said I was lucky the flat side hit me , um , otherwise it coulda gone ight through my head . I know , I know , gives me the willies , too . I guess the explosion
JANELLE: Amber ? Can we switch numbers ? I need to go first . My cousin just had a deaf baby and I get to go see it !

GLADYS: I 'll be honest . This is a hard time for me . This is the part of the pageant when you realize that tomorrow night , all but one of these girls will walk out of here a loser . It 's hard for me to know how that must feel , but I 'm sure it does n't feel good .
AMBER: Do n't you get it ? I was supposed to go first . I was contestant numbe one . That light was meant for my head . If Janelle had n't wanted to change numbers God , I owe my life to that deaf baby .

MAN #3: Tell us , does your wife also wea thick glasses ?
MAN #2: You should know , she 's you sister .
YOUNG WOMAN: 'They will pay , they will pay . ' Since when have they been killing us , putting us in jails , starving our children to death , taking our land ? Hundreds of years . And what have you men done ? Only talk , talk , talk . You are not men . Sis .
GORDON: Are you sure it was Jonathan they took away ?
STANLEY: No , no , I understand , Baas , but is that all the names ? There 's no other list somewhere ?
STANLEY: Thank you . Stanley walks up to a WOMAN .
WOMAN: They picked up my girl 13-year- old girl !
STANLEY: We are all searching .
STANLEY: What now ?
GORDON: He is our son we must find him .
JULIUS: I 'll make more inquiries John Vorster Square the special anch but I do n't hold out much hope .
GORDON: You 're a lawyer , Julius !
STANLEY: A black lawyer ! Those Boers the bastards 'll kick him around till they lose him .
EMILY: What about the Baas ? If he asks , they will give him an answer .
GORDON: When the boy was flogged he did n't help . Why should he help him now ?
JOHAN: Hi , Gordon .
BEN: Hold it , champ .
JOHAN: Is n't this Jonathan 's day to help you ?
BEN: How is he , recovering ?
GORDON: I do n't know , Mister Ben , sir the police took him .
BEN: Again ?
JOHAN: What for ?
GORDON: They arrested many . They even deny they 've got him . He 's disappeared
BEN: Disappeared ? He 's a child why did n't you tell me ? Gordon just looks at him , sadly , patiently .
LEWINSON: And when was this ?
LEWINSON: I 'll get on to them straight away Not at all I think better this time of morning after lunch , man , I 'm a zombie . Sure let you know straight away love to , Susan Cheers ! Freda ! Open an account Du Toit . Benjamin Du Toit Subject Jonathan Ngubene .
LEWINSON: Freda I said no calls Oh Right put them through . Hallo ! Yes ! How are you ? that is correct .
BEN: Hello , Dan No it 's all ight
LEWINSON: I 'm sorry . They have just officially informed me . The boy was never in detention . He died the day of the riots and as nobody came to claim the corpse he was buried a month ago .
BEN: Thanks a lot , Dan I 'll tell Gordon . 'Bye .
GORDON: Mister Ben , sir . If it was me , all right . And if it was Emily , all right . We are not young . But he 's out child . My time and you time , it 's passing . But the time of our children is coming . And now if they kill our children if we let them what is it that we lived for ?
BEN: What can we do , Gordon ? You o I We ca n't change it .
GORDON: That day , Mr. Ben , sir , when they whipped Jonathan , you also said we can do nothing . But if we had if someone heard what we had to say this would not have happened .
BEN: It 's a terrible thing , Gordon God knows I 'm sorry . But you have other children to live for I 'll help them too with their schooling .
GORDON: How did he die , Mister Ben , sir ?
BEN: I told you , Gordon He died on the day of the riots .
GORDON: That 's what they say . But I got to know for certain . How can I have peace ? I must know how my son died and where they buried him .
BEN: Gordon . The police if they 've said
GORDON: I do n't care what they say . He is my child . God is my witness today I can not stop before I know what happened and where he lies . His ody belongs to Emily and me .
BEN: Do n't worry ! I 'm no crusader . I 've known Gordon a long time , that 's all .
CLOETE: I understand it 's you Christian duty to your neighbor .
BEN: Something like that yes .
CLOETE: Just do n't get too close . Teachers must stay out of politics . Love to Susan !
ROBERT: Look who 's coming ? It 's baba !
EMILY: Oh , no oh no , Lord . Gordon hurries to embrace her .
BOY: Baba , I heard you 're looking fo Wellington . He 's out , Baba .
STANLEY: Where is he ? Where is he ?
BOY: He 's with some boys at Dube 's shop .
STANLEY: Thank you very much . You 've worked like a man . Let 's go .
GORDON: Did they do that to you ?
GORDON: I want to know what happened to Jonathan .
WELLINGTON: Is n't he out yet ? I last saw him weeks ago .
STANLEY: Jonathan is dead .
GORDON: I have to know how he died .
SUSAN: Is n't that tragic ? Jonathan was such a nice boy . Even played with my Johan when they were small , God .
BEN: And he was such a nice boy , well- mannered .
SUSAN: You said he was very bright at school .
SUZETTE: Well , this kind of journalism does n't help the situation . Look at her face ? What does she look like ?
CHRIS: The Rand Daily Mail always exaggerates .
BEN: Looks quite attractive to me . Chris and Johan laugh .
CHRIS: What does she expect ? They 're out of control . Give then an inch and they take a hundred miles . It 's in their nature . The only language they understand is force .
JOHAN: Chris , Jonathan was fifteen , like me . Would you use force on me ?
CHRIS: You 're not a terrorist . If you were like an increasing numbe of them , you 'd deserve it . Look , every time you pick up the newspaper
BEN: My God , one hundred shot ! They did n't have to kill them .
SUSAN: This bloody Bruwer woman reports one hundred shot , but the radio said only twenty and the police were attacked first .
SUZETTE: I thought the idea was to give them their own areas , banstustans . Let them live with their own kind . No chance of conflict then . Everybody 's happy .
JOHAN: And who would do the work ?
SUZETTE: Pardon ?
JOHAN: The work , who 'd do it ?
SUSAN: You for a start . Come on ! Help me clear these dishes .
GORDON: 'On the second day of our detention at John Vorster Square we were taken to one of the top floors . We were ordered to undress and they started to beat us with fists and sjamboks . This for a long time . '
GORDON: ' We were asked questions fo the whole day and night by Capt . Stolz and different policemen they never stopped . They tried to force us to say we were the leaders at our school , that we were working for the A.N.C . and got money from overseas . Capt . Stolz wanted to know the names of the students committee and where he can find Toni Mtimkulu Everytime they asked question , they beat us . It was bad beating . '
LIEUTENANT VENTER: Stay right where you are .
STOLZ: On your feet ! So , you must be Gordon Ngubene ? Gordon does n't answer .
LIEUTENANT VENTER: Niks , Kaptein .
STOLZ: Take the bastards away .
BEN: Jeezus Jeezus Jeezus Christ .
JOHAN: Good night , Papa !
JOHAN: Oh , Papa !
SUSAN: Coffee ! Come on , Johan . Time fo ed . Johan pulls back from his father 's arms .
BEN: Yes , son . Go and get some sleep . The boy nods and leaves .
SUSAN: I 'm proud of you , Ben what you 've done for that family . But darling , you should n't take these things to heart so much . What more can you do about it ?
BEN: I do n't know . I 'm just tired , I suppose .
SUSAN: Come , come to bed .
BEN: I will , in a minute . I 'll just put the thoughts of Standar Six away . They must n't be lost to posterity .
BEN: All right , time up ! Hand in you test . Moans from the students .
BEN: What 's happened , Emily ?
EMILY: I 'm sorry , Baas but it 's Gordon .
STANLEY: How 's it ? I 'm Stanley ! I heard about you ! Ben feels a little uncomfortable .
EMILY: This is Stanley Makhaya He helps us all the time . Stanley opens the door to Emily .
BEN: Do n't worry too much , Emily , I 'm sure Gordon will be home in a few days .
STOLZ: Come on , Kaffir , talk !
GORDON: Please , I 've done nothing . All I tried to do was to find
LIEUTENANT VENTER: Up with those bloody arms !
STOLZ: We do n't like gramophone records here ! Now who has been giving you informations ? Gordon does n't answer .
LIEUTENANT VENTER: Why do n't you answer the Captain , han ? He walks back to his place . Captain Stolz opens the door and shouts
STOLZ: Johannes ! The bag ! Gordon has a look of terror .
POLICEMAN: Somebody will meet you on second floor . Ben enters a lift .
STOLZ: Come on you bloody black bastard . Who has been telling you lies ?
VILJOEN: Come in , Mr. Du Toit , come in . How do you do ?
BEN: Nice to meet you , Colonel Viljoen .
VILJOEN: I used to watch you play for the Transvaal . You were one of the great wing forwards .
BEN: Long time ago . There 's a KNOCK on the door .
VILJOEN: Come in . The door opens revealing Captain Stolz .
BEN: Well to put it simply , Colonel
VILJOEN: I 'm always grateful for that .
BEN: I thought there might have been some kind of misunderstanding I could help straighten out .
VILJOEN: Like what ?
BEN: I know him , Colonel . He works at my school . He 's done work fo me too .
VILJOEN: And you feel you know him enough to vouch for him .
BEN: Yes , after so many years 10 years . Gordon 's not the type to get himself in trouble . He 's an honest , hard-working , church- going man .
VILJOEN: Ha ! You 'd be surprised how many honest , decent , church-going men we come across during a working day . He leans back comfortably in his chair .
BEN: I appreciate that but Gordon would never
VILJOEN: Not an easy task either the press screaming blue murder especially the English .
BEN: Colonel believe me , I 'm with you all the way . But in this case I 'm sure that in you worthy pursuit of the guilty you have , unwittingly , involved the innocent . After all , we 're all human . We all make mistakes sometimes . Viljoen laughs again .
VILJOEN: We are indeed , Mr. Du Toit we are indeed . Though there 's many who might need persuading as to that fact . Then authority .
BEN: Colonel , I 'd welcome it .
VILJOEN: Good !
BEN: Jonathan .
VILJOEN: The eldest .
BEN: Yes . He died some time ago . Viljoen does n't react .
VILJOEN: What do you know about Gordon 's activities since Jonathan 's death ? The noise stops behind .
BEN: Nothing , Colonel .
VILJOEN: Did Gordon ever discuss the death with you ?
BEN: Of course he did he was upset . The Colonel pauses .
VILJOEN: But he accepted the truth ?
BEN: He is a religious man in the end he would have resigned himself to it .
VILJOEN: Would have ? You mean he did n't ? Was he angry ? Rebellious ?
BEN: Come on , Colonel ! If one of you kids died and nobody would tell you how it happened or where his body is uried , would n't you be upset ?
STOLZ: We told him how his son died , Mr. Du Toit .
VILJOEN: You have a son , Mr. Du Toit ?
BEN: I 've never doubted it , Colonel . It 's you who appear to be doubting me . These questions . You 're making me feel like a criminal .
VILJOEN: I 'm sorry , Mr. Du Toit I 'm sorry . It 's force of habit . Once a policeman , always a policeman , eh ?
BEN: One last favor , Colonel ?
VILJOEN: Fire away !
BEN: Gordon 's wife she 's very worried . May she bring him some food and a change of clothes while he 's still here ?
VILJOEN: No problem ! Thank you for you help
BEN: Thank you . I 'll rely on you , then .
VILJOEN: Will you find your way out ?
BEN: I think so . And thanks . I feel much happier now .
VILJOEN: Good ! And give my regards to your father-in-law tell him we 'll have a drink sometime maybe go to a game .
BEN: I will . Goodbye . And the door shuts behind him .
VILJOEN: Is the little bird singing yet ?
STOLZ: I 'm working on it .
VILJOEN: Good . Stolz leaves , shutting the door behind him .
BEN: I talked to them . Gordon will be eleased soon . The colonel was very understanding .
JOHAN: Did you see Gordon ?
BEN: No .
JOHAN: Did they say anything about Jonathan ?
BEN: No , but Johan , he is dead . We ca n't do anything for him . Do n't mention this visit to your mother . Okay ?
SUZETTE: What extra-mural interest ?
SUSAN: Champion of political detainees !
SUZETTE: Is that right , Papa ?
BEN: That 's right , Suzette . But , only one detainee 'Gordon ! '
SUZETTE: Our Gordon ?
BEN: That 's right .
SUZETTE: My God . What on earth for ?
BEN: Of course it is . I went down there , told them . They 're looking into it .
SUZETTE: Went down where ?
BEN: John Vorster Square . Suzette giggles , amazed .
SUZETTE: You old devil you . Does Ma know ?
BEN: No . And you 're not going to tell her .
SUZETTE: Be careful . I do n't want my favorite Papa in trouble , Gordon or no Gordon .
BEN: More wine ? Viviers ?
VIVIERS: Not for me , Oom Ben . I 'm drunk enough .
BEN: Mrs. Cloete ?
MRS. CLOETE: Please ! Ben serves her .
MRS. BESTER: Will you be free on Wednesday afternoon ? I have one or two other things to buy .
SUSAN: Come in . The door opens and Stanley steps in .
SUSAN: Who are you ? What do you want ?
BEN: It 's all right .
LEWINSON: A Friday night , man ! I 'm no doctor , I 'm not on standby all the loody time . Ca n't they wait 'til Monday ?
BEN: Dan ! I 'm standing here with Gordon 's clothing in my hand . It 's bloodstained
LEWINSON: Do you mean Julius Nqakula ? Too bad , he 's a good lawyer . Why are you getting so involved , Ben ?
BEN: I 'm just trying to help Gordon . You represented many cases , tell me , does this happen often ? But Gordon 's not political . Okay , Dan , I 'm sorry fo disturbing your weekend .
STANLEY: You 're all right , Lanie . Ben can just hear Emily 's soft voice .
EMILY: Thank you , Baas .
STANLEY: Come on , sisi . Tomorrow it 'll all e first-class again .
SUSAN: More coffee , anyone ? General assent .
CLOETE: The security police do n't arrest people for nothing , Ben . Leave it alone .
BEN: They could make a mistake .
CLOETE: Blacks lead double lives . One you see and one you do n't . These people surprise you all the time .
VIVIERS: That 's what I like about them .
BEN: We 're not concerned with 'blacks . ' We 're talking about GORDON . A good man and very loyal .
SUSAN: And a hard worker too .
CLOETE: A hard worker ? I had to get rid of him .
BEN: What ?
CLOETE: I fired him a few days before he was arrested for staying away from work for days . And for the sake of the school I say good riddance .
BEN: What do you mean 'good riddance ' ?
CLOETE: I have a responsibility for the children . These are troubled times , Ben , we ca n't trust the natives any more .
BESTER: You have to be extra careful about any influences , Oom Ben . Even their churches are breeding grounds for all sorts of evil ideas .
BEN: Gordon 's not subversive and definitely not a Communist .
CLOETE: Then he 's got nothing to worry about !
VIVIERS: Except his three teeth . Ou government must n't allow such things to happen . After all , it 's a Christian government . What do you say , Dominee ? Bester does n't answer .
BEN: I 'm not talking about the government ! I believe in ou government , damn it
SUZETTE: Anything else , Papa ?
BEN: Dominee ? Bester shakes his hand .
BESTER: Nee Dankie . Ben hands the glass to Viviers .
VIVIERS: Oom , Ben , may your problems be small ones !
CAPTAIN STOLZ: Johnannes , the table .
LIEUTENANT VENTER: You 're a heavy shitface . Too much mealie porridge !
STOLZ: How do you feel today ? Ready to fly ?
LIEUTENANT VENTER: 'Samson ' is ready , Captain , shall I switch him on ?
STOLZ: Okay . Gert !
GORDON: Hai !
STOLZ: That was a small taste of 'Samson . ' We have a whole day A knock at the door .
SEROKE: A letter for you , Captain .
STOLZ: What are you bloody-well waiting for ?
SEROKE: No reply , Captain ?
STOLZ: Get out of here . Seroke leaves .
GORDON: I do n't know anything about the
STOLZ: You 've had your chance . Now you 're going to shit .
GORDON: Hai ! Hai ! Hai !
BESTER: God created the whole human race so that they could occupy the entire earth . He decreed how long each nation should flourish , and what the boundaries of each territory should be . Our task is to preserve that creative diversity .
BESTER: So shall the Afrikaner people flourish .
SUSAN: Why did n't you tell me you 'd been down to John Vorster Square ?
BEN: What difference would it have made ?
SUSAN: I 'm your wife , damn it ! She turns the RADIO DOWN , irritably .
BEN: I did n't want to upset you .
SUSAN: Upset me ? It upsets me when you share your bloody secrets with a child !
BEN: Now what ?
SUSAN: We have a good life . We may not have everything we might have had if
BEN: If I 'd been more ambitious .
SUSAN: Ben , what 's happening ? Sometimes it seems to me I do n't know you .
BEN: What 's happening it 's something I 've never had to face deal with before .
SUSAN: He 's the gardener for God 's sake , not one of the family .
BEN: Be patient with me When Gordon is free you 'll have me all to yourself again promise .
SUSAN: Ben . We 're growing old .
BEN: Nonsense . One 's as old as he feels . I feel young and very attractive . I can still do my duty .
JOHAN: Papa .
JOHAN: Stanley 's here , Papa . Johan leaves .
SUSAN: Oh , bloody hell !
STANLEY: Gordon 's dead .
BEN: What ?
STANLEY: The bastards say he committed suicide hanged himself . Ben , recovering from the shock .
BEN: Suicide is that what they told Emily poor woman
STANLEY: They did n't tell her . She heard it on the radio like the rest of us . I contacted Lewinson immediately . He then rung the police to ask why Emily was n't informed . Would you believe it , they said they were sorry , and they did n't know where to contact her .
BEN: God ! I never thought Gordon could commit suicide .
STANLEY: Did you understand me ? I said , they said he committed suicide .
BEN: How do we know ?
STANLEY: Gordon was n't a coward .
BEN: Yes , but
STANLEY: What do you mean 'but ' ? What about Timol who they said had jumped from a top-floor window ? What about Ngudle ? What about Mosala ? Joyi ? Malele ? They all died in that John Vorster Square . All suicide , eh ?
BEN: Anything I can do to help ?
STANLEY: He 's got brothers .
BEN: Brothers ?
STANLEY: I 'm his brother , man , we all are ! We 'll take care of everything . That 's the African way .
BEN: Stanley , I 'd like to see Gordon .
STANLEY: Do n't look for trouble , man . You know there are riots all ove Soweto . You 're out of it . Why do n't you stay out ?
BEN: Do n't you understand ? I 've got to go .
STANLEY: You got to go ? Of course , Lanie the last farewell . But we have to be careful .
STANLEY: We expected it .
BEN: How can you talk like that ! ?
STANLEY: A guy gets picked up by the S.B he 's part of history , man .
BEN: You mean you had no hope , you did n't believe he 'd be released ?
STANLEY: Hope 's a white word , Lanie It 's not hope we need . There 's silence for a moment .
BEN: Well , thank God Emily has you to lean on , Stanley .
STANLEY: Emily is like my sister We go ack many years .
BEN: Do you belong to the xhosa tribe too ?
STANLEY: I am an African . That 's all ! Comprende ?
BEN: I am an African too ! Stanley turns abruptly .
STANLEY: What ?
BEN: I was fourteen before I wore shoes except for church I grew up on a plaas miles from any town watching sheep and
STANLEY: Bullshit ! Next you 'll have me elieving we grew up in the same country , same laws , same freedom , same everything !
STANLEY: We are now about to leave the white jungle and entering the land of love and glory . The car approaches a huge perimeter notice
BEN: So this is Soweto .
STANLEY: Land of love and glory , Lanie ! But watch out for the police and army . They 're patrolling all the time .
STANLEY: No sweets today . I 'm sorry , abies .
STANLEY: 'The living close the eyes of the dead . The dead open the eyes of the living . ' Stanley starts the car .
BEN: Please , take me to Emily . Stanley looks at him .
STANLEY: Look , we 'd took one hell of a chance to get here , let 's not push it .
BEN: I really have to see her , Stanley . Stanley drives off .
STANLEY: I said do n't push it . I have to keep you alive . What 's more the house is full of mourners .
STANLEY: What are your thoughts now ?
BEN: What do you mean ?
STANLEY: Come on . I know you came to see the body . What do you think now ?
BEN: I I can not think . I 'm confused .
STANLEY: You either believe what you saw or maybe you still prefer the government version .
BEN: For Christ sake , just get off my ack , Stanley .
STANLEY: Okay . It was a simple question .
STANLEY: Shit !
BEN: What ?
STANLEY: Dr. Hassiem has been picked up .
BEN: Who 's he ?
STANLEY: Dr. Hassiem is the doctor we got to represent Emily at Gordon 's autopsy . We wanted the truth . Ben suddenly realizes the significances .
BEN: He would have testified . Bloody hell !
STANLEY: A smart move by your Boe others . They have silenced Hassiem .
BEN: His report has to be important . We can only use what we have . Therefore , Lewinson must get a very good advocate . If only we could get hold of this Hassiem 's report .
STANLEY: What 's the use ? It 's one big game and we blacks are merely spectators . Hey Lanie , can one be a spectator as he 's being kicked around ? He laughs .
BEN: It 's not a question of being spectators . The courts are impartial , the law is what matters .
STANLEY: That 's what you all say . I have to move man . Your neighbors ! Now , be careful . They will put their marks on you !
BEN: Who ?
STANLEY: You 'll find out ! In case you need me . Do n't give your name just say 'Lanie ' phoned right ? Ben gets out of the car .
BEN: Now tomorrow at ten
STANLEY: Sharp ! At our smart liberal friend 's office , yeh !
BEN: Good night . Stanley drives vigorously away .
SUSAN: Ben , you 're not a doctor . His death was announced officially . They would n't say anything unless they were certain of their facts .
BEN: Facts ? There 's a doctor who participated at the autopsy . A Doctor Hassiem and he
SUSAN: You mean the Indian doctor who 's een arrested ?
JOHAN: It was in the five o'clock news , Papa .
BEN: That 's him , he represented Emily at the autopsy .
SUSAN: Ben , I 'm sorry about Gordon 's death , but please for all ou sakes , forget about this whole thing . Let 's get back to a normal life .
BEN: Can I have a drink ?
JOHAN: A brandy ?
BEN: You always know what I need . Johan hurries into the house .
SUSAN: Please , Ben , I 'm frightened .
PRIEST: Before I conclude , I have to say we are tired of making this journey every day , sometimes twice in one day , burying our children , and those , like our departed other , Ngubene who were merely seeking the truth ; and those who have been denounced by traitors amongst us ; and those who have een brutally killed for no eason , yes I shall say it , by the police . Let those who rule this land of ours listen to the word of God ; let them listen to ou peaceful and just demands ; let them be humble and go down on their knees and seek forgiveness , then listen to God . The crowd roars `` Amanda ! Amanda ! ''
SENIOR OFFICER: The funeral is over . I orde everyone to go home . This is not a political rally . I repeat , disperse .
NEWSCASTER: The detainee who committed suicide y hanging himself at John Vorste Square . An overseas television cameraman broke an arm during the disturbance . It 's been reported that several people had been killed by a car-bomb in Belfast Northern Island
BEN: How are you , Emily ?
EMILY: Well , thank you , Mr. Ben , sir . Eh , that 's father Masonwane , ou priest , and that 's Margaret from next door .
STANLEY: Mfundisi Sisi !
EMILY: Please sit down . Take this chair , the other one is broken .
BEN: I did n't mean to disturb you . I 've come to talk to you .
EMILY: Yes , it 's good . What I want to know is why did they kill him . He did n't do them nothing . You know , Mr. Ben , sir , I washed his whole ody for he was my husband . And I know a man who killed himself , he does n't look like that .
MARGARET: Master , you must understand she 's still raw inside .
BEN: I 'm sure .
EMILY: Robert , where are you manners today ? Do n't you greet visitors ?
PRIEST: You have to understand what 's happening to our children today , they 're like wasps when you burn their nest .
MARGARET: That 's right . Our children are saying 'that 's enough ! ' Things have to change in this country . They accuse us of being cowards .
BEN: Emily , I have really come to assure you that I will do all I can to help you find out what eally happened to Jonathan and your husband we can not bring them back to life , but we can make sure that this sort of thing wo n't ever happen again .
PRIEST: You mean well , sir , but it 's etter to forgive . If we keep the pain alive then hate and itterness will remain with us .
BEN: The air must be cleared . So we can breathe again .
PRIEST: The air can only be cleared if we forget about yesterday 's thunder .
EMILY: Mr. Ben is right . It 's not that I want to go on with this thing ecause it 's a bad thing that Jonathan died , that Gordon died that 's hard enough to bear , but I can forgive it . But they covered Gordon 's name with dirt and we must clean it up , else he 'll never have peace in his grave .
STANLEY: You must understand for us , suicide is a coward 's way out , how do they say , it 's a 'cop out . '
BEN: Gordon was n't a coward and we 'll prove that . We have a very good advocate for the inquest . His name is De Villiers . I have confidence in him and the truth will come out .
EMILY: The truth must be known . They killed my husband who would n't hurt a fly and they killed Jonathan who was only a child
PRIEST: Those people who did it are sinful people who do n't know what they 're doing .
STANLEY: He ! Mfundisi , what are you saying now ? You mean
PRIEST: We must help them . That 's the only way . They need our help , not hate , but love .
STANLEY: If that 's what you preach in you church you will soon be starving .
EMILY: They covered his name with dirt .
PRIEST: Are n't you afraid sis Emily ?
EMILY: No . In the end one grows tired of eing afraid .
STANLEY: Amen !
BEN: Emily , Stanley and I will do all we can . As I said we have a good advocate . Everyone involved with Gordon 's death will be questioned and all that 's known regarding what happened in John Vorste Square will come out .
MARGARET: How can anything come out of that John Vorster Square ? Who there will say 'Yes , we killed the oy and Gordon ? '
BEN: Lawyers ask questions .
MARGARET: And do n't policemen lie ?
EMILY: Thank you , Mr. Ben , sir for what you 're doing .
BEN: I 'm pleased I came .
STANLEY: Wait , let me check the situation . He opens the door and walks out .
BEN: Do I
STANLEY: Yes , on the floor man .
BOY: Sure 'bra ' Stanley . Take it easy . Stanley drives off at speed .
BEN: Are we still in Soweto ?
STANLEY: Why do n't you look for yourself ?
BEN: What the hell are you playing at ?
STANLEY: Precautions , Lanie .
BEN: Do n't call me Lanie ! What does that mean anyway ?
STANLEY: You will not understand , Lanie . They drive off .
BEN: I think I am without awareness . I have always cared about people , call it a social conscience . But my visit to Gordon 's house made me experience another dimension of human conditions .
SUSAN: The poverty , ja
BEN: No , I expected that . But listening to them talk made me ealize that I did not know the lacks . Now I question my attitudes , my concerns as Ben , and complacence as a white person .
SUSAN: Ben , I know your anxiety about the inquest . All will be cleared up , in a legal way , and you 'll be back to your normal self . Now let 's turn off the lights . Susan kisses Ben tenderly .
DE VILLIERS: Dr. Jansen , you are a state pathologist of many years standing and I have no doubt a well-qualified pathologist . Could you now please tell us what caused the death of the deceased ?
DR. JANSEN: I found that death had been caused y the application of force to the neck , consistent with hanging .
DE VILLIERS: You are sure about the hanging ? This pressure on the neck , could it also have been exerted in othe ways ?
DR. JANSEN: It could , but it is not for me to speculate .
DE VILLIERS: Of course not , Doctor . The list of injuries found on the body was horrifyingly long ; bruises , swellings , abrasions , broken rib , lacerations , etc . How long before death do you estimate he received these injuries ?
DR. JANSEN: I could n't say exactly .
DE VILLIERS: Roughly .
DR. JANSEN: Some were fourteen to twenty days old , others three to four days and others even more recent .
DE VILLIERS: Even more recent . I see . I understand you had a Dr. Hassiem present at the autopsy .
DR. JANSEN: That 's correct .
DE VILLIERS: There were two reports , ours and his . Did they tally ?
DR. JANSEN: Yes , it was . In most respects . ON Stanley listening .
DE VILLIERS: Is n't it normal practice to have one report ? Why did Dr. Hassiem decide to draw up a separate eport ? If he really co-signed yours .
DR. JANSEN: That 's for him to answer !
DE VILLIERS: I would very much like to , Dr. Jansen , but he 's been detained you know of course that he epresented the Ngubene family . Thank you .
DR. HERZOG: the police physician , giving evidence .
DE VILLIERS: Dr. Herzog , did you examine the deceased ?
DR. HERZOG: Yes , one day Captain Stolz called me in . The man had toothache .
DE VILLIERS: That 's all ?
DR. HERZOG: As far as I could tell yes .
DE VILIERS: You did n't examine him thoroughly ?
DR. HERZOG: Why should I ? The man was perfectly healthy , just complaining of toothache . I extracted three decayed teeth , and gave him aspirin for the pain that 's all .
DE VILLIERS: Did the captain or anyone else assist you during the examination ?
DR. HERZOG: I I can not remember .
DE VILLIERS: Dr. Herzog , tell us . Have you een intimidated by the Security Police or did you deliberately cooperate with them in playing their disgusting little game of hide-and-seek ?
LOUW: I protest , Your Worship .
MAGISTRATE: Advocate De Villiers , will you efrain from insinuations ?
DE VILLIERS: Thank you , Doctor Herzog I 'm sure Gordon Ngubene was extremely grateful ! Herzog 's face is impassive . ON crowd reacting .
MAGISTRATE: Advocate Louw ?
LOUW: Thank you , Your Worship . I 'd like to call Captain Stolz .
STOLZ: That 's right , Your Worship .
LOUW: You arrested Gordon Ngubene . Could you describe what happened ?
STOLZ: Acting on information we had eceived , I went to the house of the deceased , accompanied by Lieutenant Venter , Lieutenant Botha , and three native members of the security force . This was about 10 P.M . I informed Ngubene that he was under arrest unde Article 6 of the Terrorism Act . He then became violent and resisted arrest . A certain force had to be applied to restrain him . ON Stanley listening . ON Ben listening .
LOUW: Was the deceased ever assaulted to your knowledge ?
STOLZ: Never . He was always treated with courtesy and correctness . But , one time we had cause to use force against him . It was the day before his death . The deceased suddenly showed signs of aggression . He tried to jump through the open window of my office . He was acting like a mad man . It took six of my men to restrain him , and he had to be manacled hand and foot , for his own safety . But once he calmed down , he was eady to make a statement about his activities . The next morning we found him dead in his cell .
MAGISTRATE: Is the statement in evidence ?
LOUW: No , Your Worship . It ca n't be disclosed in court without damaging our investigation , but I would like to offer into evidence a suicide note written y the deceased . Louw , taking it from his file on the table . Stanley and Margaret listening .
MAGISTRATE: Advocate De Villiers ?
DE VILLIERS: Thank you , Your Worship . Captain Stolz , you said you treated the deceased always with courtesy and correctness , then how do you account for the injuries found on the body ?
STOLZ: Sometimes detainees deliberately injure themselves for propaganda purposes .
DE VILLIERS: You say he tried to jump out of the open window Are there no ars to prevent such an act ?
STOLZ: They had been removed for repair .
DE VILLIERS: And why did he wish to jump out ? Because you were torturing him ?
STOLZ: He was n't tortured .
DE VILLIERS: Perhaps it was the toothache then . No reaction from Stolz .
LOUW: Those documents can not be introduced as evidence , You Worship , in view of the fact that state security is involved .
DE VILLIERS: I put it to you , Captain that the only subversive activities the deceased had been involved in were his efforts to establish what happened to his son , Jonathan , allegedly shot during a riot , although several witnesses are prepared to testify that he died in detention one month later .
LOUW: I protest
DE VILLIERS: This would support my case that an innocent man has died in your hands under highly questionable circumstances .
LOUW: If it please Your Worship this unwarranted slur on the integrity of the special branch is unacceptable and based , I may say , on allegations which are in any case irrelevant to the present inquest .
MAGISTRATE: I agree .
DE VILLIERS: If the police are really interested in retaining an unsullied eputation , they should not object to the real facts being presented . Thank you , Captain .
LOUW: The real facts are being presented as the following affadivits prove . They are all by detainees who testify that they had all seen the deceased intermittently from the time of his detention to the time of his death and on all occasions he was in good health .
DE VILLIERS: I trust the signatories of these documents are available to corroborate their evidence in person .
ARCHIBALD: I never saw Gordon Ngubene . A sudden stillness in the court . ON Ben . ON Stanley . ON Melanie . ON Louw .
DE VILLIERS: Are you saying that you did n't sign this statement ?
ARCHIBALD: I never met Mr. Ngubene they forced me to sign . Captain Stolz , he hit me many times with a rubber hose he said he would kill me 'less I signed this this is what he did to me .
DE VILLIERS: Thank you , Mr. Archibald .
MAGISTRATE: Advocate Louw ?
LOUW: No thank you , Your Worship .
DE VILLIERS: May we put up the second signatory ?
LOUW: Your Worship the other three signatories can not appear fo easons of state security . He sits down , bland , examining his papers .
DE VILLIERS: Your Worship , I 'd like to recall Captain Stolz .
STOLZ: He fell down the stairs a few days ago .
DE VILLIERS: Fell down the stairs . You should do something about those stairs , Captain , so many people fall on them . Thank you . The crowd laughs .
STOLZ: Your Worship , may I be excused ? I have to escort detainee Archibal ack to John Vorster Square .
MAGISTRATE: You may , Captain , and thank you . I think this 's a good moment to adjourn we 'll reconvene at two thirty .
BEN: De Villiers is making mincemeat of them .
LEWINSON: He 's very good . His cross- examination has got them rattled .
BEN: It 's obvious to anybody ! The evidence is clear ! Did you see Archibal 's back ? He did n't have to tell the truth .
LEWINSON: That 's what Stolz is saying to him right now in his torture room .
EMILY: Captain Stolz lied . My husband never fight the police when he was arrested . They were rough with him , pushing him and threatening .
DE VILLIERS: When your husband 's clothes were given to you , in what condition were they ?
EMILY: There was blood on them and in the back pocket I found three oken teeth .
DE VILLIERS: Now Mrs. Ngubene , you have seen the note that 's said to have been written by your husband . Do you ecognize the writing ?
EMILY: That 's not how my husband writes . He never wrote that letter , they lie .
DE VILLIERS: Thank you , Mrs. Ngubene .
MAGISTRATE: Advocte Louw ? He shakes his head .
EMILY: They killed my husband and son .
MAGISTRATE: Will you take the woman out ?
DE VILLIERS: I 'd like to call my last witness . Grace Nkosi .
GRACE: Yes sir , at John Vorster Square .
DE VILLIERS: For how long ?
GRACE: Six months .
DE VILLIERS: Can you tell us what happened to you during that time ?
GRACE: I was interrogated by many special policemen , but mainly Captain Stolz and the one they call Venter . As they were searching somebody I know , they wanted me to tell them where that person was hidden . As I refuse to cooperate they beat me with a sjambok . After some time I fell and they kicked me in the face and stomach . ON Ben obviously shocked .
GRACE: I spot blood and they try to make me lick it . Then Captain Stolz threw a wet towel and started twisting it around my neck until I lost consciousness . They did this several time and the last one Captain Stolz said 'come on meid , speak up , or do you want to die like Gordon Ngubene ? ' A few days later I was eleased . ON Melanie taking notes .
DE VILLIERS: Thank you , Miss Grace . That 's all , Your Worship .
LOUW: You made that up . Say you made it up .
GRACE: It 's the truth . I have nothing more to say . Louw sits down .
MAGISTRATE: We shall adjourn until tomorrow morning . I 'll hear the arguments and give the verdict .
MAGISTRATE: I have listened to all the evidence and the arguments . To egin with I have to say that there was no conclusive evidence offered to prove beyond doubt that members of the Security Police had een guilty of assault or any irregular conduct on the deceased . There were indications that Ngubene was aggressive and on more than one occasion had to be estrained with force . There was sufficient evidence to conclude that death had been caused by a trauma following pressure applied to the neck , consistent with hanging . Consequently , I find that Gordon Ngubene committed suicide by hanging himself and that on available evidence his death can not be attributed to any act or omission or amounting to a criminal offense on the part of any person .
BEN: totally depressed , walking up to Emily .
STANLEY: Do n't worry , man . There 's anothe day ! Ben leans towards Emily .
BEN: I 'm sorry , Emily .
REPORTERS: 'Mister Du Toit , how do you know Mrs . Ngubene ? ' 'Mister Du Toit , can you answer , is it true , he was a terrorist ? ' Ben tries to get through .
REPORTER: Hang on , Melanie , I 'm coming with you .
MELANIE: Fuck off . The press is still pursuing them . As Ben and Melanie reach Melanie 's car
BEN: My car is over there .
MELANIE: Never mind your car . Let 's get away from these vultures .
MELANIE: By the way , I 'm Melanie Bruwer .
BEN: Obviously of the Rand Daily Mail . I read your article about Jonathan .
MELANIE: Ten out of ten , Mr. Du Toit . I know about you too .
BEN: You do ? Melanie smiles .
MELANIE: We have a mutual friend . One Stanley .
BEN: I remember . The mortuary in Soweto The ambiguous Stanley .
MELANIE: Stanley ? No . Just careful . A ig black rough uncut diamond . Do n't be fooled by his happy-go- lucky attitude . There 's much more to him .
BEN: He could n't have given you a glowing report of me . I 'm sorry , but where are we going ?
MELANIE: I thought a cooling drink at my house .
BEN: Mrs. Bruwer , I 'm not
MELANIE: I promise you . I 'm not after an interview or anything like that . She smiles .
BEN: I really must go home .
MELANIE: Please , Mr. Du Toit , and you 'll meet my darling father . She smiles again . A disarming smile .
BEN: How long have you lived here ?
MELANIE: Oh , about twenty-one years . I love this house .
BRUWER: Is that you , Melanie ?
MELANIE: Of course , Dad . I want you to meet a friend .
BRUWER: Does anyone have a friend nowadays ?
MELANIE: Mr. Du toit , Dad .
BRUWER: Do you like bees ?
BEN: I have nothing against them .
MELANIE: Be careful , I can see philosophy coming .
BRUWER: You shut up . Let me tell you about bees , and for that matter ants a bee has a completely altruistic sense of purpose based on the common good . A course from which he can not be deflected . Greed , ambition , they mean nothing to him . He lives solely to serve his fellow bee .
MELANIE: What about individuality , Dad ?
BRUWER: There 's the rub , my girl . There 's the rub . One of these days I 'll ask the bees . I 'm sure they have the answer . Now , you two run along !
MELANIE: A drink , Dad ?
BRUWER: I 've been peeing too much this morning .
MELANIE: That 's my Daddy . Melanie and Ben enter the house .
BEN: Please . A
MELANIE: A brandy ?
BEN: No thanks , a beer will be fine .
MELANIE: The mugs are the few things that Dad brought from Germany . He studied philosophy in Tubingen and Berlin before the last war .
BEN: I thought they were German ?
MELANIE: Mr. Du Toit , tell
BEN: Please , call me Ben .
MELANIE: All right , Ben , tell me , why are you so depressed ? You really expect a different verdict ?
BEN: Why do you ask ? Can you understand it ?
MELANIE: Of course I understand it . What could they have . I 'm not cynical . I 'm only trying to be realistic .
BEN: Tell me , Miss Bruwer
MELANIE: Ben and Melanie , that 's fair .
BEN: Tell me , do you believe in the notion of justice ?
MELANIE: I 'll never stop believing . But in this country I 've learned it 's pointless to look for it in certain situations .
BEN: What use is a system if justice does not apply to all situations ?
MELANIE: Exactly . And you can not fight for justice unless you know injustice very well . You 've got to know your enemy first .
BEN: That 's a tall order 'know injustice know the enemy . ' it seems I have a long haul ahead of me .
MELANIE: Not at all , Ben . You have already taken the first steps . Welcome to South Africa ! She smiles .
SUSAN: Did you enjoy the 'bobotie ? ' When I heard the verdict on the news I knew you 'd be upset . I wanted to make you something special .
BEN: Thank you , darling .
SUSAN: I 'm glad it 's all over . You take things to heart too much .
BEN: They killed Gordon first they kill Jonathan , and then him . How can they get away with it ?
SUSAN: Now come on , Ben . Gordon 's death upset me , too . But the Magistrate had all the facts . He must know what he 's doing , he 's had years of experience . The case has run its course , and nobody can do anything more about it ! It 's all over and done with .
BEN: I 'm not so sure about that , Susan ! Susan swivels around and faces Ben .
SUSAN: I 'm damned well sure ! It 's over , Ben ! You better get that into your head .
BEN: Soweto ! Then shuts the door behind him .
BEN: More meneer Van de Merwe .
PROPRIETOR: More meneer du Toit .
BEN: Our boys gave the Eastern province a thrashing .
PROPRIETOR: Yes .
BEN: Is anything wrong ?
PROPRIETOR: No .
BEN: And a packet of tobacco and pipe cleaners .
BEN: See you tomorrow .
SUZETTE: Now , Papa , this is going too far ! How could you ?
BEN: How 's that , Suzette ?
SUZETTE: You did n't stop to think of the family . Poor mother , how can she face anyone ? And tomorrow is Sunday !
BEN: Now listen Johan steps into the veranda .
JOHAN: What 's everybody yelling about ?
SUZETTE: You listen , Papa , just tell me , why ?
BEN: Do you really think I specially arranged for the photographers to take that picture ? And what 's more it 's distorted .
SUZETTE: What 's distorted about it ? You face is practically touching that meid 's face , like you were about to kiss her .
BEN: Suzette , pull yourself together !
SUZETTE: Today the whole country has seen that photograph . We , your children , are going to suffer . At this very moment Chris is negotiating with the Provincial Council . Would you like to see them cancel it ? You have no feeling , Papa !
BEN: Suzette ! She leaves in rage .
JOHAN: What 's Papa done , anyway ? If something happened to him , would n't you be upset ?
SUSAN: Not enough , Johan , to throw myself into the garden boy 's arms .
BEN: That goes without saying .
JOHAN: There must be easier ways of getting your name in the paper .
BEN: Who ? I do n't know you and have nothing to say to you No thank you for your advice !
BESTER: Everything was examined in depth in court .
BEN: Did you read the papers , Dominee ? Were you happy with what came to light ? And is it the Magistrate 's work to pretend that the facts which came to light did n't exist ?
BESTER: Was it really facts , Ben ?
BEN: I know , Gordon . What they said about him , that he was plotting against the government is a downright lie . He was only doing what I would have done as a father ; searching for his son .
BESTER: No one but God can see what 's in our hearts .
BEN: Have you no faith in your fellow men , Dominee ? Do n't you love you neighbor ?
BESTER: Wait a minute , instead of criticizing blindly , do n't you think we have reason to be proud of the judiciary we have ? suppose this had been Russia ; what do you think would have happened then ?
BEN: What 's the use of reaching a court when a handful of people have all the power to decide what is going to be said in that court and by whom ? The one man they allowed to speak for himself , that young Archibald Chigorimbo , did n't he immediately deny everything they forced him to say in his statement ? And the girl who spoke of her own torture ?
BESTER: One can gain the world and still lose one 's soul . Tea must be eady .
CLOETE: I hope you do n't mind us talking here .
BEN: I do n't mind , Mr. Cloete .
CLOETE: I 'll come to the point . You ca n't imagine how shocked I was by that scandalous photograph in the Ossewa .
BEN: The woman lost her husband , she was shattered with grief .
CLOETE: A Kaffir woman , Du Toit .
BEN: I ca n't see that it makes any difference .
CLOETE: Have you gone color blind then ? And what about the apartheid laws ? Our first responsibility as teachers is the reputation of the school , the pupils entrusted to us . We have to be an example to them in and out of this school yard . Ben looks at him calmly .
CLOETE: I thought I had warned you about involving yourself with Kaffirs . Obviously you did n't heed my advice . That 's all I have to say for now . Cloete walks out of the room .
VIVIERS: 'Morning , Oom Ben .
BEN: Viviers .
VIVIERS: Private coffee with Cloete ?
BEN: Good afternoon , Professor .
BRUWER: Melanie is n't home . You are
BEN: Ben Du Toit . You have a nice vegetable garden .
BRUWER: You mean the area or the produce ?
BEN: Both . What plants are these ?
BRUWER: What 's the world coming to ? It 's herbs , ca n't you see ? Thyme there , oregano over there , feunel next to the tomatoes , sage here and rosemary somewhere . Poo plants , they re not in their ideal soil or climate . Next time , I 'll ing some soil from the mountain of Zeus . Perhaps the old man 's holiness will do the trick . He throws down the small weeding-fork .
BEN: Not really . I 've read a few ooks .
BRUWER: Not bad , in fact quite good . Now where was I Oh , I was going to say after decades of philosophy , I find myself being forced back to the earth . Do you know , Ben , we 're all living in the spell of abstractions . Hitler , apartheid , the great American dream , the lot ?
BEN: What about Jesus ?
BRUWER: Misunderstood .
BEN: It 's quite nice .
BRUWER: Melanie has told me a little about you . It 's not an easy road you have chosen .
BEN: I feel I have no choice .
BRUWER: Of course you have a choice . Damn it . One always has a choice . Only thank God you made the choice you did . But all I want to say is , keep your eyes open , young man .
BEN: That 's encouraging .
BRUWER: We are both Boers , Ben . We know how hard our people worked to get a toehold on this land ; it was a good life . Now look at the mess . It 's all systems and no God ! Sooner or later people start elieving in their way of life as an absolute unmutable , fundamental , a precondition . Saw it , with my own eyes in Germany , a nation running after an idea . Sieg heil , sieg heil . I left there thirty years ago because I could n't take it any longer . And now I see it happening in my own country , step by step . Terrifyingly predictable . This sickness of the great abstraction . He farts and sips his greengage wine .
BEN: What you say is very interesting and important .
BRUWER: Take for example the way the government is handling the electorate ; like a bloody donkey . Carrot in front and kick at the ackside . The carrot is apartheid , Dogma . The kick is quite simply , fear . Black peril , ed peril , whatever name you want to give it . Fear can be a wonderful ally , Ben . I talk too much , I always do with younger people , they do n't fall asleep to me .
BEN: We Afrikaners have to stop to turn a blind eye and look around us and at ourselves .
BRUWER: You are right . We still have time . History should teach us about those who regarded themselves as the chosen people .
BEN: Professor Bruwer , may I say I have needed to hear somebody say some of the things you said . I still have hope for our country .
BRUWER: If you lose that you have lost everything . I 'll get back to the earth .
BEN: Thank you .
BRUWER: I 'll tell that hot-head daughte of mine that you came to see her . Ben takes his leave .
BEN: There is absolutely no doubt that they were killed in custody . Those responsible must be punished , whoever they are , o whatever their rank .
LEWINSON: The problem is laying our hands on them .
BEN: Tell me , Dan , we lost at the inquest , what next ?
LEWINSON: The family can file a civil claim .
BEN: What does that entail ?
LEWINSON: To put it briefly , it means we have to have witnesses , affidavits and any information relating to the arrest and death of Gordon . We also need similar information on Jonathan . You see Ben , fo example , Stolz figures in both cases . That 's one link at least .
BEN: I know what I have to do .
MELANIE: I did n't think you would want to have anything to do with me afte that crap in the Ossewa .
BEN: Why ? You did n't write it .
MELANIE: I 'm a journalist , perhaps tarred with the same brush .
BEN: No .
MELANIE: So what happened ? I can imagine . The family , the dominee , colleagues , neighbors
BEN: A distorted photograph and a few poisoned words and meneer Du Toit is a leper . That 's why I called on you the other day , I needed to talk to somebody rational .
MELANIE: Thanks for the compliment . But emember , you 're an Afrikaner , you 're one of them . In their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor .
BEN: You are an Afrikaner too , and you articles , in a liberal English paper ?
MELANIE: My mother was a foreigner , I 'm not pure , wragte Afrikaner . They do n't expect the same loyalty from me that they demand from you .
BEN: What kind of loyalty ? Blind loyalty . Until the deaths of Jonathan and Gordon , I gave all the loyalty I could give , laage loyalty . You know , Melanie , we Afrikaners have always lived in our laager , we have not seen what 's beyond the mountains .
MELANIE: Has it ever occurred to you that the Volk may be scared to leave the laager ? That 's the downfall of this country . So , where do you go from here ?
BEN: We carry on . There has to be justice .
MELANIE: Justice .
BEN: We lost at the inquest , so we pursue them in a civil action . I consulted the attorney Dan Lewinson .
MELANIE: We know each other well .
STOLZ: Mr. Du Toit , if you knew what we 're working with every day of our lives , and what we 're up against , you would understand why we have to be so thorough .
BEN: However you go about it .
STOLZ: I can understand you 're upset about having your house searched but
BEN: I was n't thinking about myself .
STOLZ: What are you talking about then , Mr. Du Toit ?
BEN: My thoughts , Captain , I 'm sure , are an open book to you .
STOLZ: An interesting book Picasso Not one I 'm familiar with .
BEN: Not on your list of banned books , Captain ? Stolz does n't react
STOLZ: Mr. Du Toit . If you 're keeping anything from us , we can turn this whole house upside down if we want to . We have all the time in the world .
SUSAN: I 'm afraid I do n't understand . Nothing from Stolz .
BEN: Why do n't you go upstairs ?
STOLZ: I 'm afraid she has to stay where we can see her in case she wanted to warn someone .
SUSAN: My father 's an M.P. ! Warn who ?
MOTHER: Your father insisted that I do n't disgrace you .
SUSAN: I expected you a little later .
JOHAN: In the study . I 'll get him .
SUSAN: Please do n't say that , Papa . Ben walks in .
BEN: Sorry . Did n't hear you arrive . He shakes hands with Father-In-Law .
SUSAN: I 'll prepare some tea . I baked a cake . She goes to the kitchen .
BEN: I thought you 'd prefer Cape Town ; the sea and Table Mountain .
BEN: The inquest did n't clear up half of what happened .
BEN: It 's exactly what I said , Father , when Jonathan first got into trouble . Of course , they have good reasons hushing up how Gordon died and how his son died !
BEN: We do n't ? I 'm not sure we 're going to survive . They walk away .
STANLEY: African time .
BEN: I 'm sorry . They drive off towards Soweto .
STANLEY: Does n't matter , Lanie as long we are on time for the revolution .
BEN: The special branch searched my house four days ago .
STANLEY: The S.B . searches your house ? Did they take anything ?
BEN: A few journals , letters nothing much . Just wanted to scare me , that 's all .
STANLEY: Do n't be so sure . They may think you 're onto something big .
BEN: They 're not that stupid .
STANLEY: 'Lanie ' do n't you believe it nothing 's as stupid as the old S.B . If they decide it 's a bomb they 're looking for , you can shove a turd in their face and they 'll swea to God it 's a bomb . He laughs making Ben smile . A pause .
BEN: What ?
STANLEY: Scare you ?
BEN: No . They tried too hard . Stanley laughs again .
STANLEY: Hallelujah ! Shake , man . Join the club . Ben accepts the handshake .
BEN: What 's happening ? What 's the singing ?
STANLEY: A wake for a child ; eight months old . She was sleeping and they threw tear gas into it . They drive on .
STANLEY: On your knees , everyone , prayers time .
JULIUS: Okay , Stanley . It 's stupid , but one is forced to do these things . He walks up to Ben and offers him his hand .
BEN: I understand .
STANLEY: He 's one of the most solid lawyers we have ; they 've immobilized him , that 's the right word is n't it ? He laughs .
BEN: Stanley has told me about you . I appreciate the risk you are taking y coming here to meet me . I was eading the notes Gordon smuggled out of John Vorster Square
JULIUS: May I have a glance at them ?
JULIUS: When did you get the letters ?
EMILY: The first one two days after they took him away . And the other one came later .
BEN: But , Emily , why did n't you tell me long ago ?
EMILY: I had given my word to the man who brought them to me
BEN: Emily , I have to meet the man .
EMILY: He said he did n't want anybody to know who he is . I can not make trouble for him in his work .
BEN: He has to be persuaded . He is very important to us .
EMILY: You as a lawyer will understand .
JULIUS: You mean Dr. Hassiem . How are you going to do that ? You know of course that he is detained .
BEN: I know , with luck they may release him .
JULIUS: With luck .
BEN: But , Emily , this man is important , please try to tell him we will protect his identity . No one will know . Nothing will be done without his approval . I only want to talk to him .
JULIUS: Why do n't you leave it to Stanley and I ? What do you say , Stanley ?
STANLEY: Sure .
BEN: May I call you Julius , I 'm not very good with some African names .
STANLEY: Nqakula , that 's a hell of a name .
JULIUS: Please call me Julius .
BEN: This case must be reopened and we must win . We have to dig up everything . We need you cooperation , Julius .
JULIUS: Where do I start ? Do n't forget my restrictions .
STANLEY: They did not ban you so you could sit on your backside and have a Soweto holiday .
BEN: You could help with the affidavits . Lewinson the lawyer has stressed their importance .
JULIUS: We know each other . He 's a good lawyer for this kind of case . Of course I 'll do what I can . My commitment forces me .
BEN: I 'm glad .
JULIUS: How are you planning to safeguard the documents ? Stanley told me you have already had a said by the S.B .
BEN: I would n't worry . I have a secure place .
STANLEY: Let 's hope so .
EMILY: I 'll make some tea .
STANLEY: Not for me , Sis too strong fo me . No whisky ?
EMILY: In my house ? You know bette than that , Stanley .
STANLEY: Tea then and God forgive me
SUSAN: Ben , it 's Johan . You 'd bette come .
BEN: Johan . Was it because of me ?
SUSAN: You see ! It 's gone too far , Ben . You 've got to stop it
JOHAN: I do n't care ! It does n't hurt me !
BEN: Are you sure you know ?
JOHAN: Yes . I know .
BEN: Does it worry you ? Johan looks at his father through his tears .
JOHAN: Do n't stop , Dad . You must n't give up now ! Ben hugs his son .
SUSAN: Call the police , Ben , call the police ! Johan 's voice comes from his room .
BEN: It 's okay , son we 're all right . Everything 's okay !
SUSAN: My God . They were trying to kill us .
BEN: They were trying to scare us , that 's all .
SUSAN: Oh , is that all What the hell more do you want to happen we 're ordinary people for God 's sake and you 've pitched us into this this nightmare . I ca n't take any more , Ben I ca n't take any more ! ! She drops her head and sobs .
VILJOEN: Now you must be exaggerating , Mr. Du Toit .
BEN: My house has been searched . My phone is tapped . My mail is opened . And last night three shots were fired through my window close to killing my wife . Viljoen reacts .
VILJOEN: Mr. Du Toit , if shots were fired into your premises , we will investigate .
BEN: All I want to know , Colonel , is why do n't you leave me in peace ?
VILJOEN: Now wait , wait a minute , Mr. Du Toit , you 're not trying to blame me ?
BEN: Tell me , Colonel , why is it so important to you people to stop my enquiries about Gordon Ngubene ?
VILJOEN: Is that what you are doing ? Well , now . If you possess any information that may be of use to us , I trust you wo n't hesitate to discuss it with me .
BEN: Is that a threat , Colonel ?
VILJOEN: Let 's call it a warning . A friendly warning . For God 's sake , open your eyes , Mr. Du Toit ! Do n't you see you 're being used !
BEN: By the Communists , I suppose .
COLORED WOMAN: Mr. Du Toit ? Ben nods , hesitatingly .
STANLEY: How 's it ? No trouble finding this place ? You met Sadie . She 's one of us . Ben nods to her .
STANLEY: And this is Johnson Seroke . The man of the letters .
BEN: Johnson .
STANLEY: You know they call this place Vrededorp , but we baptize it Malay Camp . Your first time in Malay Camp , Lanie ?
BEN: I 've driven through here many times .
STANLEY: The main road , eh ?
BEN: Ja . The woman re-enters .
SADIE: You 'll excuse me . Stanley , you know what to do with the key .
STANLEY: Sure , Sadie . And thank you . Can I help myself to another beer ?
SADIE: You know it is . Goodbye , Mr. Du Toit , and you , be careful . To the Seroke .
SEROKE: Okay , Sadie . Sadie leaves .
STANLEY: That woman can die for you . We must n't be long , Johnson has to e back on duty .
BEN: Alright , let 's get on with it . Stanley tells me , you work at John Vorster Square .
SEROKE: I had no choice , they transferred me there .
BEN: Yet you smuggled out letters to Emily ?
SEROKE: What do you do if a man asks you , and he 's in trouble ?
STANLEY: If they find out he 'd be in very ig trouble .
BEN: I know that . Tell me , what do you know about Gordon ?
SEROKE: Very little .
BEN: You did talk to him from time to time ?
SEROKE: He gave me the letters .
BEN: When was the last time you saw him ?
SEROKE: Just before he died .
BEN: Did you attend any of the interrogations ?
SEROKE: No . I 'm not a member of the Special Branch . But once I had to deliver a letter to Capt . Stolz , Gordon was there .
BEN: How were they interrogating him ? Seroke hesitates and looks at Stanley .
STANLEY: It 's okay . Tell him what you told me .
BEN: What ?
SEROKE: They were using the pole .
BEN: The pole , what 's that ?
STANLEY: They handcuff you and manacle you feet then they put a pole between your arms and the back of you knees . Then you 're like a chicken eady for the oven . They hang you etween two tables . Then they do what they like with you . The S.B . call it the aeroplane . Ben is horrified .
BEN: I see . Who were in that room ? Stolz
SEROKE: Lieutenant Venter and a black S.B .
BEN: You are sure ?
STANLEY: He 's sure .
BEN: It 's very interesting . When was the last time you saw him ?
SEROKE: I saw them take the body away to the cells . He was limp .
BEN: You did ! Johnson , why do you stay with the police ? You do n't really elong there .
SEROKE: It 's a job . And how can I go away ? I love my family .
BEN: I understand . I promise .
STANLEY: This is strictly between the three of us . Do n't worry , man .
BEN: No , thank you . You know , Stanley , after what happened the othe night I was about to give this whole thing up .
STANLEY: What happened , man ?
BEN: My wife nearly got killed . Three shots were fired into the house . What right have I to expose my family to harassment and actual physical danger ? That 's what I asked myself .
STANLEY: Three bloody shots and you crawl on your hands and knees to people like Stolz , and say ' I give up . ' What is the beginning for you is a version of what we suffer all ou loody life . Shit , I thought you had more guts than this , man !
BEN: I did n't say I 'm giving up .
STANLEY: But you thought about it .
BEN: Johnson has revived my determination .
STANLEY: It 's a hell of a time , Lanie , but we 'll survive . You and me . I tell you !
BEN: You think we may still win in the end , Stanley ?
STANLEY: Of course not , Lanie but we need n't lose either what matters is to stick around . Ben nods .
BEN: Why are you going there ?
STANLEY: Business . Tell you next week . Now for the bad news I 've been saving to the last .
BEN: What ?
STANLEY: Julius has been arrested . He oke his banning order and visited his sister . You know what that means ? At least a year 's imprisonment .
BEN: A year in jail just for visiting his sister ?
STANLEY: That 's the chance he took . And he 'll be the last to complain .
BEN: Do n't you think the real reason for this arrest was that they found out he was helping us ?
STANLEY: So what ? Lanie , you 're not getting guilt complexes now , are you ? That 's a luxury only liberals can afford . Julius will e back , man . All refreshed by a spell in the deep-freeze .
BEN: How can we shrug off a man we 've een working with ?
STANLEY: Who said we 're shrugging him off ? Best way of remembering a man , Lanie , is to carry on fighting .
BEN: What about you ?
MELANIE: What ?
BEN: I mean not married
MELANIE: And living in this chaos with my eccentric father ? I love him and we get on perfectly . We have een together since I was a yea old . My mother could not adapt to South Africa . She went back to London and we 've never heard from her since .
BEN: Being a professor and bringing up a child , how did he manage that ?
MELANIE: Dorothy , dear Dorothy , she was a fantastic mother . In fact she had two families , me and her three children in Alexandra township .
BEN: And this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist . Why a journalist ?
MELANIE: Sometimes I ask myself the same question .
MELANIE: Alright . I 'll tell you . I was ought up in a sheltered way , not that Dad was possessive , not openly anyway . I think he 'd just seen enough of the mess the world was in , to want to protect me as much as he could . Then , I went to university . I do n't know what you 'll think being a teacher . Pause .
BEN: About what ?
MELANIE: Then I married my ex-teacher .
BEN: Oh . He must have been young .
MELANIE: Fifteen years difference . He too protected me like Dad . Then one day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township . I was shocked , Ben , and ashamed .
BEN: Go on .
MELANIE: That made me think that I was a parasite , something white and maggot-like just a thing a sweet and ineffectual thing . I felt more and more claustrophobic . Poor Brian , who loved and pampered me . Had no idea what was happening . I left him for a whole year and we divorced .
BEN: And then you became a journalist ?
BEN: Did it work ? She returns to the kitchen with a cigarette .
MELANIE: I wish I could give you a straight answer . What did help me was my wanderings in Africa .
BEN: How did you manage that on a South African passport ? We South Africans are white devils in Africa .
MELANIE: My mother was English , remember ? So I get a British passport . It comes in handy even for the paper .
BEN: You really are your father 's daughter !
MELANIE: I wonder what he 's doing right now . Most likely standing on a ock , looking through his old inoculars at springbok or a lion or whatever .
BEN: How often does he go on these trips to the veldt ?
MELANIE: It depends Bonjour , Ben . I 'm Porto and my friend is Bello !
EMILY: Do n't you touch me !
CROWD: Buya ! Buya !
STANLEY: She 's a widow , man . That 's what happens in Soweto when a woman loses her man . They throw her out of the house and out of the city .
BEN: Zululand ! The whole thing smells of being an excuse to send he hundreds of miles from the case . And how will they live there ?
STANLEY: Shit ! I was about to find her a place , but I had to go to look for Robert .
BEN: So , that 's why you went to Botswana for .
STANLEY: Sis Emily asked me but it was no use . His mind was made up . He was going to join Wellington in Zambia .
BEN: Could n't you stop him ? He 's a little boy , Stanley ! Stanley gulps down his whisky and stands up .
STANLEY: He 'll be back in a few years . And he wo n't be throwing stones ! Then , puts the empty glass on the desk .
JAIMIE: Open the boot ! You cheeky bastard !
STANLEY: Okay , with pleasure . They search and find nothing .
JAIMIE: Open the door and remove the seat .
OTHER POLICEMAN: Now , your pass , bliksem .
JAIMIE: You watch your bloody step ! Right ?
SUSAN: Ben , please stop whilst there 's time . Please , Ben .
BEN: It 's impossible to stop now , Susan . I believe I 'm right in what I 'm doing . If I stop now I 'll go mad .
SUSAN: Whatever the price you pay for it ?
BEN: I have got to .
CLOETE: Think of your heritage , man . My God think of your wife , you family , friends , neighbors . What 's going to happened to them all of us if we ca n't depend on our own kind ? We 're educationalists teachers . We are building for the future .
BEN: Without simple justice we do n't deserve a future .
CLOETE: We 're Boers , man Afrikaners . We are your nation . What 's justice for us is justice period !
BEN: That last remark was slanderous I 'm simply being faithful to the truth .
CLOETE: Slanderous ? My God , man , you slander a whole people .
BEN: It wo n't be necessary , Mr. Cloete . I 'll send you my resignation .
CLOETE: Thank you for making things much easier .
BEN: Are you serious ?
CLOETE: He 's a Kaffir-lover too , is n't he ?
VIVIERS: Oom Ben , I was waiting for you . I have something interesting to tell you .
BEN: Later , Viviers .
VIVIERS: But , Oom Ben , it 's about the S.B . they came to question me . Before they started questioning me I told them they were wasting their time . Ben does n't react .
BEN: I 'm sorry , Viviers . I neve wanted you to get involved . I have just resigned .
VIVIERS: What ? Ben drives away .
JOHAN: Was last year 's turkey as big as this , Papa ?
BEN: About the same size .
SUZETTE: Do you remember the turkey I had for Easter ? You said it was as ig as a baby ostrich , Papa .
BEN: I do n't remember that , Suzette .
JOHAN: As big as this table .
BEN: I think he deserves the parson 's nose for that remark .
STANLEY: Oh ! Merry Christmas , everyone !
BEN: Stanley . What are you doing here ?
STANLEY: Why do n't you tell the Boer who this Kaffir is ?
BEN: Shut up , Stanley . That 's all right . I 'll
CHRIS: Ben , did you hear that ? Call the police , Ben !
BEN: Please , go to the table . Stanley , wait outside .
STANLEY: Who are these people , anyway ?
BEN: Stanley , this is still my house .
CHRIS: Let me throw him out .
STANLEY: Let him try , leave him , Lanie .
BEN: Please leave me with him . I 'll explain everything later .
SUZETTE: Chris !
STANLEY: Lanie ! Ever in your fucking life seen such a stampede , hah ?
BEN: Maybe you think it 's funny , Stanley , but I do n't . Do you ealize what you 've done ? Come into the dining room . Stanley follows Ben slowly , swaying .
STANLEY: Jeez , who was that old cunt with the potbelly and black suit , looks like an undertaker ?
BEN: My father-in-law .
STANLEY: You joking ! Shit ! I fucked it all up for you . Sorry , man .
BEN: Now pull yourself together , Stanley . It 's not funny at all ! What 's the matter with you today ? You 're drunk and making an idiot of yourself . Say what you 've come to say . Otherwise , go to hell !
STANLEY: Right . Dead right . Put the Kaffir in his place .
BEN: Bloody hell ! Stanley , what 's wrong with you ?
STANLEY: Emily is dead . Ben stares at him in stunned disbelief .
BEN: Emily dead ? How ? When ? Stanley does n't answer - he cries .
STANLEY: A broken heart . All they said .
BEN: God .
MELANIE: They do n't know what you 've got and you 're a danger to them . I know there 's a point of no return , ut with our system , one has to plot the route with care .
BEN: That 's the main reason for coming here tonight . Melanie , I need your help . Without Emily , we ca n't pursue our civil suit . The only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press , and the media here and abroad .
MELANIE: And your safety also , Ben , lies in the press . That way the world will know the utality and power of ou security services ; here questions can be asked in Parliament . And the white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this country .
BEN: You know , Melanie , I 'm discovering that the enemy is not in Soweto . The enemy is ourselves . Ou igotry , our laws , our system . We have our own fight and it 's just eginning .
MELANIE: We better win before the blacks have won . Ben and Melanie laugh .
BEN: Now , before going to the press , I have to have all the documents . I must have two vital affidavits ; Dr. Hassiem 's , he 's detained and Jonathan 's friend , Wellington has fled to Zambia .
MELANIE: Zambia ? I 'm going to Rhodesia I can go to Zambia .
BEN: Could you ?
MELANIE: And I can use my British passport . I know my way around Lusaka .
BEN: That would be very useful . Melanie jumps off the settee .
MELANIE: This calls for a drink . Gin and tonic ?
BEN: Please .
MELANIE: Of course , Ben . She goes into the kitchen .
MELANIE: Cheers !
BEN: Do be careful . I would n't want you hurt . She reaches for his hand .
MELANIE: Do n't worry .
BEN: And hurry back . A new track starts on the RECORD .
MELANIE: That 's my favorite , Ben .
BEN: I ca n't dance .
MELANIE: Rugger player ?
BEN: Listen , you
WOMAN: Darling , put that down , it 's not good for your cholesterol .
BEN: I 'm sorry , my mistake . He pushes his trolley away embarrassed .
SUZETTE: Better She 's waiting for you to ask her to come home .
BEN: I doubt it .
SUZETTE: Papa , I do n't want to interfere
BEN: Then do n't . A pause .
SUZETTE: I know this is going to sound strange coming from me I mean I have n't exactly been supportive for the past months I ca n't say I agree with what you 've done but I respect you for what you are ON Johan listening .
BEN: Suzette
SUZETTE: Please , Papa , for Mom 's sake For all of our sakes Let 's try and patch it up .
BEN: Thanks . I 'm glad you understand .
SUZETTE: I do n't want to worry about you . That search , this vandalism , those shots they 're really after the evidence you 've been accumulating Can I look after them for you , Papa ? Ben smiles .
BEN: You do n't have to worry . They 'll never find them .
SUZETTE: Where on earth do you keep them ?
BEN: Dr. Hassiem ? I 'm Ben Du Toit . I 'm a friend of Gordon Ngubene 's
DR. HASSIEM: The inquest is over , Mr. Du Toit .
BEN: Not for me , Doctor . I 've got to know what happened to Gordon . Dr. Hassiem looks shaky , nervous .
DR. HASSIEM: I only came home yesterday . Afte three months in detention and now I 'm banned and confined to the house . There 's nothing I can do for you .
BEN: I know it may be painful to you , Doctor , but I need to talk to you .
DR. HASSIEM: How can I be sure you were n't actually sent by them ?
BEN: Ask Emily . Doctor , we are in the process of filing a civil claim . And your help is vital .
DR. HASSIEM: Come in .
BEN: Thank you for inviting me in .
DR. HASSIEM: What do you want to know ?
BEN: Just one thing , Doctor . Why did you sign the State Pathologist 's eport on the autopsy if you drew up your own report as well ?
DR. HASSIEM: What makes you think I signed Dr. Jansen 's report .
BEN: The report produced in court had oth your signatures on it .
DR. HASSIEM: Impossible .
BEN: What did you write in your report ?
DR. HASSIEM: Dr. Jansen and I did n't disagree on the facts . After all we examined the same body in the same time . But just on the interpretation . For example , if Gordon , had really been hanged , the marks on his throat would have een concentrated on the front . But in this case , the bruises were more obvious on the sides . Pause . Ben nods , silent .
BEN: What was it ? Dr. Hassiem puts down his daughter .
DR. HASSIEM: You see , through a misunderstanding I arrived at the morgue too early for the autopsy . There was n't a soul around except a young African attendant . When I told him I 'd come for the autopsy , he let me in . The body was on the table dressed . I noticed blood on the clothes .
BEN: And then ?
DR. HASSIEM: As I examined the clothes more closely , a police-officer came in and said I was n't allowed in the morgue before Dr. Jansen arrived . When I returned with Dr. Jansen , half an hour later , the body was naked .
BEN: Doctor , we 've already got the African attendant 's affidavit . He testified that Capt . Stolz ordered him to burn the clothes . Did you mention what you said in your report ?
DR. HASSIEM: Of course . I found it most odd .
BEN: Doctor Hassiem would you be prepared to put that in writing ? Dr. Hassiem thinks it over for a while then
DR. HASSIEM: Please excuse me for a minute .
BEN: You have a copy of the report ? Hassiem grins .
DR. HASSIEM: I know how to hide things from the S.B. , Mr. Du Toit . Ben congratulates him by a deep laughter .
DR. HASSIEM: I hope you have as secure a place as I have .
BEN: I think so .
STANLEY: Take a pew , man .
BEN: We have it , Stanley !
STANLEY: Have what ?
BEN: Hassiem 's report . You know what that means , Stanley ? Melanie arrives in two days . We 'll have all the evidence . Everything is in place . We 'll get them yet , especially Stolz .
STANLEY: That 's fantastic , man .
BEN: God ! It 's Johnson Seroke .
STANLEY: Late at night . A knock on the door . He opened and five shots , point-blank range . Face , chest , stomach .
BEN: ' A police spokesman when questioned said `` It 's not the first time that a black member of the police has lost his life in the service of his country , fighting terrorism . '' Bloody bastards ! They killed him . Stolz must have thought he knew too much .
STANLEY: What 's the score ? The nurse is detained ; the mortuary attendant has disappeared ; the police van driver who brought Jonathan to hospital is detained . Julius is in jail , and now Johnson dead .
BEN: Who 's next on their secret list , I wonder ? How much longer must the list grow of those who pay the price of our efforts to clea Gordon 's name .
STANLEY: Hey ! Are you going soft , Lanie ? We must keep going even more so now . And for every bloke who 's going to die of bloody natural causes in their hands . And fo our children 's future .
BEN: I know . If I can no longe elieve that right is on my side , if I can no longer believe in imperative to go on , what will ecome of me , Stanley ?
STOLZ: We 're all made of flesh and lood , Mr. Du Toit we 've all got our flaws . And if a man likes to sample the grass on the othe side of the fence , well , that 's his own business . But it would e unpleasant if people found out about it , especially if he 's a teacher .
BEN: You mean , if I cooperate , if I stop digging , embarrassing you , threatening you these photographs will disappear .
STOLZ: Let 's just say I may be able to use my influence to make sure that a private indiscretion is n't used against you .
BEN: Suppose I refuse ? Stolz looks past Ben .
STOLZ: Is this your son ?
BEN: Johan , leave us alone , please . Johan walks away .
STOLZ: Do n't you think this business has gone long enough ? Ben , struggling to maintain his composure .
BEN: That 's for you people to decide . Is n't it ? I wo n't be blackmailed , Captain not even by you .
STOLZ: Mind if I smoke ? Ben answers by a gesture .
BEN: Yes , I think so and there 's more to come . A pause .
STOLZ: I really hoped we could talk man-to-man .
BEN: It 's not possible , Captain . Not etween you and me .
STOLZ: It 's high time , Mr. Du Toit , we allowed the dead to rest in peace . I 'm offering you a chance .
BEN: You mean my very last chance ?
STOLZ: One never knows . It may not be important to you , but we have to survive .
BEN: If we can only survive through murder and torture , then we have forfeited our right to exist .
STOLZ: Is that your final answer ?
BEN: Before you go . I 'll tell this , Captain . I have a pretty good idea of what I will eventually uncover . I mean the truth . And I wo n't allow anyone o anything to come between me and that truth .
STOLZ: Here 's my card my private line . If you should change your mind Let 's say before the end of the week ?
BEN: Goodbye , Captain , and do n't forgt the photograph .
STOLZ: Be careful , Mr. Du Toit . There are people who can make things very difficult for you .
BEN: They are wasting their time . They just ca n't hurt me anymore . I trust you 'll give them the message , Captain .
JOHAN: A brandy , Papa ?
BEN: A gin and tonic would be fine .
INDIAN WOMAN: I did see her . She was ahead of me . Maybe she 's still in there .
BEN: Thank you .
OFFICIAL: Can I help you ?
BEN: I 'm waiting for a passenger , Miss Bruwer . She 's taking a rathe long time to be cleared .
OFFICIAL: What did you say her name was ?
BEN: Melanie Bruwer .
OFFICIAL: I 'll go and check .
JOHAN: Is there any other exit , Papa ?
BEN: No . They have to collect thei luggage and pass through customs .
JOHAN: Maybe she ca n't find her bag .
BEN: That 's possble .
STOLZ: Afternoon , Meneer Du Toit . Johan , is n't it ?
BEN: What now , Captain ?
STOLZ: Word came to me that you were asking after your very good friend , Miss Bruwer . You know , subersives come in all guises and can be very resourceful . Now let 's take your friend , she has been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of this country . But you know something else ? She has been secretly holding a British passport . A South African passport and a British pasport . Now you tell me , where is her patriotism ? He allegiance ? The minister telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable immigrant . So she is being put on the first available plane to London . This must be heart- eaking for you . Good afternoon , Meneer Du Toit , Johan . Stolz walks back .
BEN: Let 's go home , Johan .
JOHAN: I do n't understand , Papa
BEN: I 'll explain later . They hurry out of the building in silence .
JOHAN: I took it out . Hide it in my secret place .
BEN: Thank you , son . You did a man 's job .
JOHAN: Somebody has dropped it through the door .
BEN: Thank you .
JOHAN: I 'm nearly ready , Papa .
BEN: Wellington 's affidavit !
STANLEY: What 's happened , man ?
BEN: It 's you . It was a bomb .
STANLEY: And the papers ?
BEN: Do n't worry . Safe . Thanks to Johan . Incidentally , I have Wellington 's affidavit . Melanie found him . She 's being deported . The official reason is that she possessed a British passport . I do n't know how she managed to smuggle the envelope to me .
STANLEY: Man , it 's all happening !
STANLEY: Like a joint ?
BEN: No , thanks .
STANLEY: They drop the bomb on you !
BEN: How are you , Suzette ?
SUZETTE: Okay , Papa .
BEN: Would you like a drink ?
SUZETTE: No , thanks .
BEN: I know . Suzette awkwardly kisses him on the cheek .
VILJOEN: I see you got the goodies .
SUZETTE: I was on my way to your office , Colonel .
STOLZ: We thought we 'd save you the trouble , Mrs. Klopper . She hands Viljoen the envelope .
SUZETTE: Here it is , Colonel .
VILJOEN: Thank you . This country needs more people like you .
SUZETTE: I must hurry , Colonel . Goodbye . She drives off .
VILJOEN: Now let 's see what we 've got .
VILJOEN: The bastard !
MRS. TEASDALE: It is so good of you to come .
NOTABLE: An honor , Mrs. Teasdale You must indeed have great faith in your new dictator to give him such a magnificent reception .
MRS. TEASDALE: I feel that Rufus T. Firefly is the only logical successor to my dea departed husband . He has the statesmanship of Gladstone , the humility of Lincoln , and the wisdom of Pericles .
SERVANT: His Excellency , Ambassador Verdi Trentino of Amnesia !
TRENTINO: Mrs. Teasdale my niece , Vera . Mrs. Teasdale shakes the girl 's hand warmly .
MRS. TEASDALE: Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis . Without his country 's financial aid

TRENTINO: That 's where you come in . I 'll leave him in your hands , and do n't forget you 're supposed to be my niece . Vera winks agreeingly .
MRS. TEASDALE: I want you to meet the son of His Excellency Bob Firefly
TRENTINO: Is n't it about time for the ceremony to begin , Mrs. Teasdale ? I do hope His Excellency wo n't be late .

GROUCHO: They think I should - They think I should - They think I should - They think I should be king .
APPLAUSE: Mrs. Teasdale rises .
MRS. TEASDALE: My dear friends , in time of peace we should forgive those who fought against us , and so , I have invited our former enemies .
GROUCHO: No , no , this is the one
CHICO: Hey , she wants some salt
GROUCHO: Ambassador , how 's the food ?
AMBASSADOR TRENTINO: It 's delicious , Your Excellency .
GROUCHO: That 's all I wanted to know .
LLOYD: Excuse me , can you tell me how to get to the medical school ? I 'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver 's a bit lost .
YOUNG WOMAN: Go straight aheads and makes a left over za bridge . Lloyd checks out her body .
LLOYD: I could n't help noticing the accent . You from Jersey ?
YOUNG WOMAN: Austria .
LLOYD: Austria ? You 're kidding . Well , g'day , mate . What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie .
DISPATCHER: Carr 22 , come in , car 22 Lloyd grabs his CB mike .
LLOYD: This is 22 .
DISPATCHER: 22 , where the hell are you , Lloyd ? You 're running late on the East Side pick-up .
LLOYD: Cool your jets , Arnie . I 'm on my way .
DISPATCHER: Well hurry it up . And make sure you park legally . One more ticket and your ass is history .
HARRY: Okay , gang , single file . You know the rules No pushing , no humping , and no sniffing heinies
PALMER: Hey , why are n't those mutts on leashes ?
HARRY: The same reason you 're not on a leash , sir because it 's demeaning and it chafes like hell .
PALMER: Just get them in here now ! They all have to be bathed and clipped in an hour .
HARRY: You kids stay right here
MARY: Hello . I 'll be just a minute
LLOYD: Why you going to the airport ? Flying somewhere ?
MARY: How 'd you guess ?
LLOYD: Well , I saw your luggage , then when I noticed the airline ticket , I put two and two together . So where you heading ?
MARY: Aspen .
LLOYD: Oh , you 're gon na love it . I hea California 's beautiful this time of year .
MARY: I 'm Mary .
LLOYD: Uh , this is n't my real job , you know . It 's only temporary .
MARY: Oh ?
LLOYD: Yeah , you see , my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store .
MARY: That 's nice .
LLOYD: I got worms .
MARY: I beg your pardon ?
LLOYD: That 's what we 're gon na call it I Got Worms . We 're gon na specialize in selling worm farms you know , like ant farms . A lot of people do n't ealize that worms make much bette pets than ants . They 're quiet , affectionate , they do n't bite , and they 're super with the kids .
MARY: Are n't ants quiet , too ? Lloyd realizes she has a point .
LLOYD: Uh well , sure but they are n't half as affectionate . And if you cut an ant 's head off , it wo n't grow back .
MARY: I see .
LLOYD: And best of all , worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-yea industry . I would n't mind having a piece of that pie , if you know what I mean .
MARY: Something like that .
LLOYD: It 's really nothing to worry about , Mary . Statistically , they say you 're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport . You know , like in a head-on crash , or something .
MARY: Um , Lloyd , could please keep you eyes on the road .
LLOYD: Good thinking . There 's a lot of bad ivers out there . Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel .
MARY: Here you go .
LLOYD: Keep it . It was my pleasure .
MARY: Thanks Lloyd . And good luck with your worms .
POLICE OFFICER: Come on , move it , you 're in a red zone . Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away .
ARMANI SUIT: She 's gon na leave the briefcase at the foot of the escalator . You make the pick-up .
PLAID SPORTCOAT: Piece of cake .
LLOYD: Drive around me , you pinhead !
MENTAL: Who the hell do you figure this guy 's working for ?
SHAY: I do n't know , but we 'd better find out
MENTAL: It ai n't gon na kill me .
HARRY: I got fired again . Lloyd shakes his head .
LLOYD: I do n't mean to be harsh , Harry , but let 's face it , you are one pathetic loser . No offense .
HARRY: None taken . Were you shitcanned , too ?
LLOYD: Of course not . I quit .
HARRY: Why 'd you quit ?
LLOYD: I had a hunch Arnie was gon na fire me .
HARRY: Why did n't you wait and see if you suspicions were well-founded ?
LLOYD: Winners control their own destiny , Har .
HARRY: You know , the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle . The alarm alone cost me two hundred .
LLOYD: Big deal . That car 's an old bom anyway .
HARRY: What are you talking about ? It 's only six years old .
LLOYD: That 's forty-two in dog years .
HARRY: What 's with the briefcase ?
LLOYD: It 's a love memento .
HARRY: Huh ?
LLOYD: The most beautiful woman alive . He name was Mary . I drove her to the airport . Sparks flew , emotions ran high , breasts heaved . She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life . End of story .
HARRY: What 's in it ?
LLOYD: DO you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else 's private property ?
HARRY: Why not ?
LLOYD: It 's locked .
HARRY: We do n't have any friends . Harry is still squinting out the peephole .
LLOYD: Hey , I ordered Mystic Mint . The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butte Praline .
HARRY: Well , whoever they are , they look serious . One of them 's even wearing plaid .
LLOYD: That 's a hostile pattern . I say we ail and get down to unemployment .
GRABNER: Gentlemen , I 'm delighted to say that neither I nor the unemployment epartment of the state of Rhose Island can do anything for you . You 've run out of chances . You 're unemployable . Remember last year ? Middle of winter I busted my butt to
LLOYD: Blew it ? For your information , we only missed three days in two months .
HARRY: Yeah , and that was because of a lizzard
HARRY: Come on , Stan . I 'm sure you can find something else for us . How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline ? Grabner jumps up .
GRABNER: OUT ! ! ! ! !
MENTAL: The briefcase ai n't here . He must 've taken it with him .
J.P. SHAY: Shit . Well he 's got ta come home sometime .
MENTAL: Maybe we should leave him a little message to let 'em know we 're playing hardball .
LLOYD: Give me what 's left of our dough . I 'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities . Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills .
HARRY: Get Robitussin it 's a better buzz .
LLOYD: Excuse me , little old lady , do you have change for a dollar ?
ELDERLY WOMAN: Change ? No , I 'm sorry , I do n't
LLOYD: Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar ? My wallet 's locked in this machine .
ELDERLY LADY: Of course , young man
HARRY: Where 's the booze ?
LLOYD: It 's gone . I got robbed by Grandma Walton . She got my wallet , too . Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN .
HARRY: It gets worse , Lloyd . My parakeet Petey he 's he 's dead . Lloyd looks touched by this .
LLOYD: Oh man , I 'm sorry , Harry . What happened ?
HARRY: His head fell off .
LLOYD: His head fell off ?
HARRY: Yeah , he was pretty old .
LLOYD: I do n't suppose he had a warranty ?
HARRY: Nah , I bought him used .
LLOYD: That 's it ! I 've had it with this ump ! We do n't have food , we do n't have jobs , our pets ' heads are falling off , we 're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old
HARRY: Okay , calm down .
LLOYD: No I wo n't calm down . Lloyd flops down in a chair .
HARRY: Yeah , and go where ?
LLOYD: I 'll tell you where someplace warm , a place where the beer flows like wine , where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano . I 'm talking about Aspen .
HARRY: Aspen ?
LLOYD: That 's right , Aspen .
HARRY: I do n't know , Lloyd , the French are assholes .
LLOYD: Let me ask you something do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment , face- down on a Dear Abby column , with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak ? Or do you want to enjoy your life ? Come on , Harry , do n't let Petey 's eath be in vain . Do n't you see what he was saying ? Spread your wings , man . he was saying ? Spread your wings , man . Fly .
HARRY: What are you talking about , Lloyd ? His head fell off . Wait a second , I know what you 're up to . You just wan na go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost he iefcase and you need me to drive you there .
LLOYD: That 's bullshit . I 'll drive . And what 's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline ?
HARRY: I do n't know , Lloyd . I think we should stay here , hunt for jobs , and keep saving money for the worm store . I 'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors .
LLOYD: You know what I 'm sick and tired of , Harry ? I 'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life . I 'm sick and tired of being a nobody .
HARRY: Come on , Lloyd . Give us a kiss .
LLOYD: On the other hand , maybe you 're right , Harry . Maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court . With all those lawsuits against us , I 'm sure we 'll win at least one . It could be a boost to our egos .
HARRY: Petey , I made a promise to you once , man and I 'll be damned if I can remembe what it was .
LLOYD: Well , we 're finally doing it . Do you ealize that in all the years we 've known each other , this is the first time we 've done this together .
HARRY: Been run out of town ?
LLOYD: Taken a trip .
HARRY: What ?
LLOYD: Take your seatbelt off .
HARRY: Because we just cleared the dange zone .
LLOYD: Huh ?
HARRY: Do n't you know anything , Lloyd ? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home . We 've already traveled 6.3 miles .
LLOYD: Well what about the people who live around here ? What if we got into an accident with one of them ?
HARRY: Where 'd you get those ?
LLOYD: Bought 'em when we filled up .
HARRY: Lloyd , I thought we agreed to confe on all expenditures . We 're on a tight udget , remember ?
LLOYD: This did n't come out of our travel fund . I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left . You know , so we could live in style .
HARRY: Where 'd you get twenty-five extra ucks ?
LLOYD: I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C .
HARRY: You mean the blind kid ?
LLOYD: That 's right . Lloyd looks out the window guiltily .
HARRY: What did you sell him , Lloyd ?
LLOYD: Just some odds and ends .
HARRY: Specifically ?
LLOYD: Oh , a few baseball cards , a sack of marbles , Petey , three comic books a second , are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid ? Well who else was I gon na sell it to ?
HARRY: But Lloyd , Petey did n't even have a head .
LLOYD: Put your mind at ease , friend . I took care of it .
BILLY: Fly !
MENTAL: Those bastards . They 're rubbing it ight in our faces .
J.P. SHAY: Shit ! Andre will have a goddamn aneurysm if we do n't get that iefcase back .
MENTAL: Do n't worry , we 'll get it back . And I 'll tell you something else . They ai n't gon na reach Aspen , either . I 'll make sure of that .
BILLY: Come on , boy , fly !
MENTAL: Do n't worry , Ironside , he just flew south for the winter .
HARRY: How far have we gone ?
LLOYD: According to this map , about an inch and a half .
HARRY: Shit . We 're gon na need a smaller map or we 'll never get there . We do n't have enough gas money .
LLOYD: Relax . We have more than enough .
HARRY: I believe you 're wrong , Lloyd .
LLOYD: And I believe I 'm right , Harry .
HARRY: I still say wrong , Lloyd .
LLOYD: How much you wan na bet ?
HARRY: I do n't bet .
LLOYD: What do you mean you do n't bet ?
HARRY: I mean I do n't gamble , you know that . Never have and never will .
LLOYD: Oh , bull . I 'll bet you our next meal that I can get you gambling before the day 's out .
HARRY: There 's no way , Lloyd . You ca n't do it .
LLOYD: I 'll give you three-to-one odds . That 's three feedbags if you win , against only one if you lose .
HARRY: You 're wasting your money , Lloyd . I already told you , I do n't gamble .
LLOYD: Okay , five-to-one I can get you gambling before the day 's out .
HARRY: Sorry , pal , no way .
LLOYD: Make it ten-to-one . Harry sticks out his hand .
HARRY: You got yourself a bet , sucker !
WAITRESS: It 's the soup-of-the-day .
LLOYD: Sounds tasty . I 'll have a bowl .
WAITRESS: Anything else before I leave the area ?
HARRY: Actually , this chocolate milk is n't mixed very well . Could you please ing me a spoon ?
WAITRESS: There . Now you do n't need one . The guys watch her stomp away .
HARRY: What 's the matter ?
LLOYD: You spilled the salt . That 's bad luck . We 're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck . Quick , toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder .
HARRY: What for ?
LLOYD: Because that 's good luck .
MALE VOICE: What the fuck ? !
LLOYD: Or was it the left shoulder ?
TRUCKER: Who 's the dead man threw shit in my eye ?
HARRY: It was a terrible accident , Sir . Believe me , I would never do anything to offend a man of your size . Please accept my most sincere apology .
SEA BASS: You gon na eat that ?
HARRY: Um the thought had crossed my mind .
SEA BASS: Still want it ? Harry stares at the burger non-commitally .
HARRY: Nah , you go ahead .
LLOYD: Well if you 'd stop picking fights with the locals Wait a second . I think I just had an idea . Follow me
SEA BASS: Huh ?
LLOYD: What I 'm trying to say is , my friend and I would like to buy you guys a ound of beers , just to bury the hatchet .
SEA BASS: Make it four boiler-makers .
LLOYD: Whatever you want , sir . I 'll have the waitress send them over . Oh , and fellas hope to see you again down the road .
HARRY: Lloyd , what are you doing ? You know we ca n't afford to buy them drinks . Lloyd hands the Cashier their check .
LLOYD: Um , Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check . They said just add this to their tab .
CASHIER: Sea Bass said that ?
LLOYD: Well , if that guy at the table ove there is Sea Bass
CASHIER: Okey-dokey , if that 's what he wants
HARRY: Oh , and put these on there , too .
CASHIER: You got it .
LLOYD: By the way , how far is it to Rhode Island from here ?
SEA BASS: I 'm gon na kill those sons-of-bitches !
CASHIER: Hurry and you 'll catch 'em . They was on their way to Rhode Island .
LLOYD: I just wish we could 've seen Sea Bass 's face when he got the bill .
HARRY: I hope we never have to .
LLOYD: Do n't worry . That fish-head is probably half-way to Providence by now .
HARRY: I hope so . Harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously .
LLOYD: Hey , stop the car . I got ta take a whiz .
HARRY: Are you crazy ? I 'm not stopping now . What if they figure out we went the other way . They 'll be on us in no time .
LLOYD: But I got ta go . What am I supposed to do ?
HARRY: Hold it .
LLOYD: I ca n't hold it . I 'm about to explode .
HARRY: Well just take a whiz in an empty eer bottle . There 's a couple on the floor in the back seat .
LLOYD: Are you serious ?
HARRY: Yes , I 'm serious . I 'm not stopping now . We could get killed .
LLOYD: Uh-oh
HARRY: What 's the matter ?
LLOYD: The bottle 's almost full and I 'm still going .
HARRY: Well stop going .
LLOYD: I ca n't stop once I already started , you know that . Quick , get me anothe ottle .
HARRY: I 'm sorry , Lloyd . I 'm doing the best I can .
LLOYD: Here , hold this .
HARRY: What are you , a goddamn camel ?
LLOYD: Hey , I have n't gone all day . Just then they hear a LOUDSPEAKER
STATE TROOPER: Pull over !
HARRY: Huh ?
STATE TROOPER: PULL OVER !
HARRY: No , it 's a Cardigan ! But thanks fo noticing !
STATE TROOPER: PULL YOUR CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE
HARRY: Yes , sir , we had a little ifficulty in the car .
STATE TROOPER: Uh-huh . Have you boys been doing a little inking maybe ?
HARRY: No , sir .
STATE TROOPER: Then what 's that ?
HARRY: Oh , that 's nothing , sir .
STATE TROOPER: Do you know it 's against the law to ive with an open alcohol containe in this state ?
LLOYD: But , your honor , he 's telling the truth . It 's not beer . The officer smirks .
STATE TROOPER: Is that right ?
HARRY: Sir , I would n't TROOPER You 'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you .
STATE TROOPER: Get the hell out of here .
MARY: How does that feel , Lloyd ?
MARY: How 's the other side ?
LLOYD: Nothing . Nothing at all .
MARY: Lloyd , will you wash my nipples ?
HARRY: I do n't know , Lloyd , I feel a little sleazy staying here when we 're not even engaged .
LLOYD: Hey , it 's the only motel that charges y the hour . We ca n't afford anything else .
HARRY: What 's that ?
LLOYD: If you had a nice set of knockers .
HARRY: That 's two things , Lloyd .
LLOYD: Right now I 'd settle for one .
HARRY: I do n't know , Lloyd , these places just do n't do it for me . Brings back too many memories .
LLOYD: What happened , Harry ? Some little filly break your heart ?
HARRY: Nah , it was a girl . Fraida Felcher . We stayed at a place like this once No-Tell Motel out on Route 31 .
LLOYD: Felcher ? You mean the babe who worked for the tractor company ? Harry nods .
HARRY: The same . We had this incredibly omantic time . Boy , I thought we 'd e together forever .
SIGHS: Then about a week later , right out of the blue , she sends me a John Deere letter .
LLOYD: That 's cold , Har . Give you any reason ?
HARRY: I called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to he enough or something like that . I was n't really paying attention .
MENTAL: The boys are holed-up in a little love nest for the night . I think they 're a couple of fucking weirdos .
ANDRE: What in hell are those guys up to ? Is it possible that they 're Feds ?
MENTAL: Unlikely from what I 've seen .
ANDRE: I do n't like this one goddamn bit , Mental . You and Shay were supposed to grab that bag so we could end this shit . Now I do n't know what the hell 's going on .
MENTAL: Hold on a second , Mr. Andre
ANDRE: Look , Mental , just find out what they 're up to . I want to know who these guys are .
MENTAL: Do n't worry . I 'm on it .
SHAY: What the fuck ?
MENTAL: Where 's the goddamn dog ?
MARY: It just does n't make any sense . I left the money exactly where they instructed me to .
HELEN: Actually , it makes a great deal of sense , Mary . We should have called in the authorities the moment we knew Melvin had been kidnapped .
KARL: Now , Helen , we 've been through this already for Christ 's sake , Karl , these bastards will extort us into ankruptcy if we let them .
MARY: But I 'd never forgive myself if something happened to Melvin .
KARL: Stop upsetting my daughter , Helen . She 's been through quite enough already .
MARY: It 's not her fault , Daddy . We 're all a little on edge .
ANDRE: Has there been any word , Mr. Swanson ?
KARL: Nothing yet , Nicholas . Andre looks upset .
ANDRE: Perhaps I should call off the Preservation benefit this weekend .
HELEN: No , Nicholas , it 's imperative that we carry on as usual .
KARL: Do n't worry , sweetheart . I 'll do everything they ask . Nothing 's going to happen to Melvin , I promise you .
MARY: Thank you , Daddy . Karl Swanson looks out the window , concerned .
MENTAL: Lie down on the front seat . Afte they pick me up I want you to follow us .
LLOYD: You 're it . Harry taps Lloyd back .
HARRY: You 're it . Lloyd immediately taps Harry .
LLOYD: You 're it . Quitsies .
HARRY: Anti-quitsies . You 're it . Quitsies . No anti-quitsies . No startsies . Lloyd shakes his head , defeated .
LLOYD: Damn , you 're good , Harry . Hey , did n't I tell you this trip would be a blast ?
SHAY: What happened ?
MENTAL: These fuckers are really pissing me off now .
HARRY: Refresh my memory on something , Lloyd what exactly do we do when we get to Aspen ?
LLOYD: Well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous Aspenese air .
HARRY: Fresh , huh ?
LLOYD: The freshest . They say on any day of the week you can smell a moose-fart ten miles away .
HARRY: Wow talk about paradise . And after we 're finished breathing , what next , Lloyd ?
LLOYD: Then we make a splash on the social scene .
MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE: That 's two cheese burgers , two fries , and two medium Cokes . Five seventy- two .
HARRY: Thanks .
MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE: Hey ! But the guys are already around the corner .
HARRY: About this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we do n't even have any money ?
LLOYD: Look , once we drop the briefcase off to Mary , she 'll be so grateful she 'll plug us right into the party circuit . After that , we do a little of the ski
HARRY: Where 'd you hear that ?
LLOYD: Some bum down at unemployment . Harry thinks about this .
HARRY: I do n't know , Lloyd .
LLOYD: What 's the matter ?
HARRY: Money does terrible things to people . I mean , we could lose our friendship .
LLOYD: Yeah ? So ?
HARRY: What ?
LLOYD: Are n't you forgetting something ? Harry thinks about this .
HARRY: What ? Lloyd rolls his eyes .
LLOYD: My change .
HARRY: I think this guy 's in trouble . Why o n't you pull over .
MENTAL: You guys going as far as Des Moines ? My car died and I 'm late for a usiness meeting .
HARRY: It 's a fruit .
LLOYD: It 's a vegetable .
HARRY: I 'm telling you , it 's a fruit .
LLOYD: And I happen to know it 's a vegetable .
HARRY: Tell you what , why do n't we leet an impartial judge decide .
LLOYD: Fine with me . Harry turns to Joe Mental .
HARRY: Hey , Mr. Mentalino , settle our bet Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables ?
LLOYD: Okay , Harry , my turn . Let 'er rip .
HARRY: And ?
LLOYD: Kit-Kat bar .
HARRY: You 're the best , man . Okay , my turn .
LLOYD: Where are your manners , Harry ? We have a guest . Harry punches Mental 's shoulder playfully .
HARRY: Come on , Mr. Mentalino . Let one fly . It 's only a buck .
LLOYD: Okay , you go first .
HARRY: No , you go first .
LLOYD: No , you go first .
MENTAL: Why do n't you both stop being a couple of pussies and go at the same time . It ai n't that hot .
LLOYD: Hmmm , not bad
HARRY: Yeah , more tingly than hot .
MENTAL: Have some water . It 'll help .
ANDRE: Good work . What did you find out so far ?
MENTAL: Nothing yet , but I 'm gon na shake 'em own for information at lunch . Then I 'm gon na kill 'em for dessert .
ANDRE: Well eat fast , time 's running out .
MENTAL: Relax , they ai n't gon na be running around anywhere after I dump a little cyanide in their pops .
HARRY: That really was n't very polite of him , was it ? Maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair .
LLOYD: Harry Dunne , I 'm surprised at you . Perhaps it 's about time you brushed
HARRY: You mean like 'turn the other cheek ? '
LLOYD: No , I mean like 'an eye for an eye . ' Hand me those peppers the atomic ones .
HARRY: Here he comes .
MENTAL: Feeling any better , boys ?
LLOYD: More like re-location .
MENTAL: Does n't look like you packed much . All I saw was a couple bags and that briefcase .
HARRY: The briefcase is n't even ours . Some lady just left it at the airport . We 're bringing it back to her . This is news to Mental .
MENTAL: You mean you do n't even know her ?
LLOYD: Not really . I was just her limo river .
MENTAL: Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time
HARRY: Hey , you okay , man ? It was just a goof .
MENTAL: My ulcer quick pills in my coat
HARRY: I ca n't believe it
LLOYD: Life is a fragile thing , Har . One minute you 're chewing on a burger ; the next minute you 're dead meat .
HARRY: But he blamed me . You heard him . Those were his last words .
LLOYD: If you do n't count that gurgling sound . Harry lets out a GROAN .
HARRY: Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids .
SIGHS: Do n't you get it , Lloyd . I 've got a ead guy pissed at me . His restless spirit will probably haunt me fo the next seventy-five years .
LLOYD: That 's ridiculous . You probably wo n't live to see forty . Harry perks up , cheered by this thought .
HARRY: Oh yeah . Wow . What a relief .
DOCTOR: My official conclusion is that the eceased expired from oxygen eprivation caused by the presence of cyanide in the bloodstream .
DT. DALE: You mean he was poisoned ?
DOCTOR: Unquestionably . We found these by the body .
COP: Waitress says he was with a couple of younger guys . They 're the ones who called the ambulance then they hit the road .
DT. DALE: Any idea where they were going ?
COP: A witness at the next table thought he heard them say they were driving to France . Dale frowns at this and the Cop shrugs .
DT. DALE: Get a make on the vehicle ? The Cop consults his note pad .
COP: Yes , sir . They were driving an '84 poodle . Dt . Dale does a double-take .
DT. DALE: An '84 what ?
COP: Well it might have been a wire-haired terrier , Detective . They 're very similar in appearance . The Detective looks confused , as we
HARRY: Let 's get off and crash at a motel efore I crash into one . I need a crib fast .
LLOYD: Sorry , Har . We 're gon na have to hold out . Seems we misjudged our expense allocation . If we pay for a motel we wo n't have enough for gas .
HARRY: What happened to the dough ?
LLOYD: We over-leveraged .
HARRY: On what ?
LLOYD: I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper 's last meal . Felt it was the least we could o after we deep-sixed him .
HARRY: Wait a second one burger put us over budget ?
LLOYD: The slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe and a chocolate malt .
HARRY: Oh . So what are we gon na do ?
LLOYD: Drive . We 've only got ten more hours . We can take turns .
SHAY: You heard me , he 's dead . The bastards killed him .
ANDRE: Jesus Christ
SHAY: How 's our bankroll doing ? Giving you a hard time ?
ANDRE: Melvin 's not the problem . It 's these two other guys that have me worried . I wish I knew what the hell they wanted .
HARRY: Come on , wake up . You pay , I 'll pump .
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: That 's right .
HARRY: Great . She continues to pump gas .
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Uh-huh..
HARRY: Both of 'em ?
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Um , yeah .
HARRY: Cool .
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Excuse me , you 're spraying everywhere .
SEA BASS: Well , well , well , if it ai n't my old friend . And right on time As Sea Bass STEPS INTO THE STALL , we
HARRY: That 's a lot of luggage for a little vacation .
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Actually , I 'm moving to Aspen . I 've got to get away from my boyfriend .
HARRY: Here , this is a little loose .
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Why not ? You seem pretty harmless . I 'll give you my number . Just let me find a pen .
HARRY: Look , why do n't you just tell it to me , I 've got a good memory .
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Are you sure you wo n't forget ?
HARRY: Positive please hurry . He begins hopping around violently .
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Is something wrong ?
SEA BASS: First I 'm gon na rape you , then I 'm gon na kill you . Any last request ?
LLOYD: Um , yeah could you do it the othe way around ?
HARRY: You 've got some serious explaining to o , young man .
LLOYD: Look , Harry , I told you what happened , now drop it .
HARRY: Sure thing , Lloyd . I promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six-foot , five-inch trucker with his pants own .
LLOYD: That 's a low blow , man .
HARRY: Not at that height it 's not .
LLOYD: Listen , bud , if you 're trying to imply that I 'm that thought look , we 're almost in Colorado .
HARRY: I think it 's about time we pull ove and change seats . I 've been driving for nine straight hours I do n't have the energy to start a new state . Lloyd nods , and as he pulls off the exit , we
DT. DALE: Any sign of them yet ?
COP: No , but we 're expecting them shortly . A motorist said he spotted a pooch about thirty miles back headed this way . Detective Dale nods , satisfied .
LLOYD: Hey , I picked you up a Beef Jerky
HARRY: How long have I been out ?
LLOYD: I 'd say a good five hours , anyway . Harry yawns and stretches .
HARRY: Great . We must be getting real close , huh ?
LLOYD: Should be . I 've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night .
HARRY: Good man .
LLOYD: Boy , I 'll tell you , this is one angerous highway . You would n't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs , a couple of rabbits , a snake and some ig thing I could n't even recognize .
HARRY: That 's awful . Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there ?
LLOYD: I hit 'em .
HARRY: Funny . I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this .
LLOYD: I was thinking the same thing . That John Denver 's some full of shit , huh ? They both stare out the window .
HARRY: Yeah , it really is . Wait a minute when did you visit Des Moines ?
LLOYD: Last night . We drove through it .
HARRY: What are you talking about ? You were snoring like a baby when we went through Des Moines .
LLOYD: Hello ? Hello ? Anybody home ? Rise and shine .
LAUGHS: You were the one who was asleep ,
HARRY: Uh , Lloyd , refresh my memory Does n't the sun rise in the east and set in the west ?
LLOYD: In our country it does , yes .
HARRY: Then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7 30 in the morning when we 're heading west .
LLOYD: I 'm only human , Harry . Anybody can make a mistake .
HARRY: You know , I got half a mind to just jump on the bus to Europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever .
LLOYD: You ca n't take a bus to Europe , dodo .
HARRY: Oh yeah ? Why not ?
LLOYD: You do n't have a passport . Harry lets out a defeated SIGH .
HARRY: A tad ? Lloyd , you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction . Now we do n't have enough money to get to Aspen , we o n't have enough money to get home , we do n't have enough to eat , we do n't have enough to sleep !
LLOYD: Well it does n't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it . If we 're gon na get out of this hole , we 're gon na have to dig ourselves out . Harry thinks about this .
HARRY: You know , you 're absolutely right , Lloyd .
LLOYD: Where you going ?
HARRY: Home . I 'm walking home .
LLOYD: You ca n't be serious .
HARRY: Why not ? We 're probably only five miles away .
LLOYD: Thanks a lot , Mr . Perfect . Like you never screwed up .
HARRY: Look , man I 'm sorry . I never should have let you talk me into this in the first place . You 've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl 's waiting for you . But let 's face it , Lloyd , there 's nothing waiting for me in Aspen . There 's nothing waiting for me anywhere .
LLOYD: Got room for one more , if you still want to go to Aspen . Harry looks the hearse over .
HARRY: Where 'd you find this baby ?
LLOYD: Used car dealer . I traded the van for it . Plus I got the guy to throw in fifty bucks for gas money . Come on , man , what do you say ? We still partners ?
DT. DALE: It does n't make sense . They should 've een here hours ago .
COP: Maybe they 're smarter than we thought .
DT. DALE: How smart can they be ? They 're riving a goddamn dog !
COP #2: We just got a report that they were spotted about two hours ago heading east near Des Moines on I-80 .
DT. DALE: Des Moines ? ! Why that 's five hundred miles from here !
COP #1: Guess they got wind of our welcoming party .
DT. DALE: We 're wasting time . Let 's mobilize .
LLOYD: Tell me something , Harry . Would you eally have kept going home if I had n't come back to get you ?
HARRY: Well let me put it this way , Lloyd Do you remember when we were Cu Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard ? We huddled together all night , and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we 'd never ever leave each other 's side again . Do you remembe that ? Lloyd thinks hard about this .
LLOYD: We were never Cub Scouts .
HARRY: Exactly .
LLOYD: Relax , it 's empty .
HARRY: I do n't give a shit . I 'm not driving anywhere with a casket . You know I 'm superstitious calm down . We 'll dump it off first chance we get .
WOMAN: I married a cheapskate .
MAN: Shut your trap , Gerdie .
WOMAN: I 'm so embarrassed . I 'll never be able to show my face again .
MAN: I knew something good would come out of this .
WOMAN: We could have given him a more ignified burial .
MAN: Your uncle was a cheap man . Remembe what he got us for our twenty-fifth ? A friggin ' fern . There 's no way I 'm gon na spend a load to get him planted .
WOMAN: You son-of-a-bitch ! I want a ivorce !
LLOYD: Is n't this wonderful ? What more could a couple of single guys like us ask for ?
HARRY: How about food and shelter ?
LLOYD: You 're so materialistic . Why do n't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary . Who knows , maybe she 'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two ?
HARRY: Jolly good idea , chap . And where oes the lovely young lady reside ?
LLOYD: Um good question .
HARRY: Well what 's her last name ? We 'll look it up in the phone book .
LLOYD: Hmmmm You know , I do n't believe I caught that either . Harry 's concern grows .
HARRY: What about the briefcase , Lloyd ? There must 've been a name on it , ight ?
LLOYD: Come to think of it , there is . It 's engraved right into the leather .
HARRY: What is it ?
LLOYD: Samsonite spelled just like it sounds .
HARRY: Any soup left ?
LLOYD: A little . Shall we share it ?
HARRY: Please .
LLOYD: Mmmm mmmm good
HARRY: Hey , you got something stuck in you front teeth .
LLOYD: Hmmm looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky .
HARRY: Wan na split it ?
LLOYD: You 're pathetic . Get your own .
HARRY: I 'm freezing my ass off , Lloyd .
LLOYD: Roll up your window .
HARRY: It is rolled up .
LLOYD: Then I guess the damn anti-cold system is n't working . You really should get it fixed if we 're gon na live here all winter .
HARRY: What anti-cold system ? Lloyd points to the dash .
LLOYD: Right here the A/C button . I put it on full blast about an hour ago and , if anything , the car 's getting colder .
HARRY: To warm up .
LLOYD: What are you worrying about now ?
HARRY: I 'm worried about how you 're gon na survive the pummeling I 'm about to give you .
LLOYD: Huh ?
HARRY: Get over here and take your medicine , Lloyd !
LLOYD: Sorry , doc , I ca n't take medicine . I 'm a Christian Scientist !
HARRY: Something I should 've done a long time ago . This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along .
LLOYD: Do n't do anything foolish , Harry .
HARRY: Foolish ? This is the most sensible thing I 've done in years . I 'm gon na toss this goddamn curse right into that river . Lloyd starts to follow after Harry .
LLOYD: You 're making a big mistake , Harry ! I 'll never forgive you for this !
HARRY: You 're bluffing .
LLOYD: No I 'm not , man look .
HARRY: That 's a filling , you liar !
LLOYD: Harry , look !
HARRY: Sounds good .
LLOYD: And we 'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs .
HARRY: We 'll be meticulous right down to the last penny .
LLOYD: That way , whatever we borrow we can pay back .
HARRY: Absolutely . We 're good for it .
LLOYD: You know , as soon as we get jobs .
HARRY: It 'll come right out of our first paycheck .
BARNARD: This is the Hotel Danbury 's Presidential Suite , gentlemen . It 's normally reserved for royalty , visiting dignitaries , and illustrious stars of stage and take it .
LLOYD: Thanks , Barnard , but we 'll find ou own chicks .
BARNARD: I was n't talking about ladies .
HARRY: Oh . Then go ahead and send thim up . What are their names ? Barnard SIGHS .
BARNARD: Sir , I meant your luggage . Harry forces a. embarrassed half-smile .
LLOYD: Tell you what you can send up , my friend how about some chow ? The Bell Captain nods .
BARNARD: I 'll bring you a menu .
LLOYD: Do n't bother . Just order us one of everything .
HARRY: One of everything ? Lloyd Lloyd looks guilty .
LLOYD: Oh , sorry . Make that two of everything .
BARNARD: Yes , sir !
LLOYD: Our first IOU . Signed and dated .
HELEN: Mary ? You awake ?
HELEN: I brought you some tea . I thought it might help you relax . Mary smiles .
MARY: Thank you . She takes a mug , sips , and pulls back .
HELEN: Uh , sorry that one 's mine .
MARY: Just knowing that Melvin 's out there , eing held by God knows who It 's all my fault . I should 've been there .
HELEN: Bullshit . You ca n't blame yourself for this . If you 'd been there they would 've taken you , too .
MARY: Maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing ove with .
HELEN: Now Mary , everything that can be done is being done . You 've got to stop torturing yourself .
MARY: What am I supposed to do ? Go about my life as if everything were fine ?
HELEN: That 's exactly what you should do . Get the hell out more , go skiing , socialize . Do n't you see , honey ? We ca n't let on that anything is wrong . If the press or authorities get wind of this , the kidnappers might panic . Who knows what they 'd do to poo Melvin then ?
HARRY: Oh god , it 's really true . Last night I thought I might 've been dreaming .
LLOYD: It 's no dream , Har . We finally cracked the big time .
HARRY: And it was so simple . All it took was somebody else 's money .
LLOYD: What 's the big deal ? We 're gon na pay it all back anyway , right ?
HARRY: Sure , but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards ?
LLOYD: Surfboards ? I thought those were eginner 's skis . This suddenly makes sense to Harry .
HARRY: Ahhh . I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them .
LLOYD: Where 'd this come from ?
HARRY: I bought it .
LLOYD: What for ?
HARRY: I like the feel of it against my skin I mean , you know , when a woman 's wearing it . Lloyd inspects it more closely .
LLOYD: Harry , how many women do you know who wear a size XXL ?
HARRY: Look , leave me alone . I 'm rich now . I 'm supposed to have a few eccentricities . There 's a KNOCK on the door .
LLOYD: Enter , parlez vous !
BARNARD: I brought you your newspaper and some champagne , gentlemen . Unfortunately , we did n't seem to have the , um , label you requested .
LLOYD: All out of Boone 's Farm , huh ?
BARNARD: You have a rapier wit , sir . I took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute Dom Perignon .
LLOYD: Guess it 'll have to do , slugger , eh ? Lloyd smiles and over tips him .
BARNARD: Thank you so much , sir .
LLOYD: Oh , one more thing You can dispense with the 'sir ' crap . Let 's face it , Barney , we 're all from the same mold . We just have a little more dough than you right now .
HARRY: Cocktail hour has commenced !
LLOYD: Harry , it 's her .
HARRY: Who ?
LLOYD: Mary with the briefcase . This is her He shoves the newspaper at Harry .
HARRY: Come on , Cinderella , it 's time to get you ready for the ball Roy Orbison 's `` Pretty Woman '' plays over a
LLOYD: Thanks for the lift , Barney .
ANDRE: Excuse me , gentlemen , but this is a five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner .
LLOYD: This should cover a couple plates .
HARRY: I 'm kind of hungry , Lloyd . What if we want seconds ?
LLOYD: Put us down for four plates , my good man .
J.P. SHAY: Jesus Christ , boss it 's them .
LLOYD: I 'm getting nervous , Harry .
HARRY: relax , Lloyd . These people are just like you and me .
LLOYD: What are you talking about ? They 're educated , well-bred , charming , and sophisticated .
HARRY: So what ? We can be sophistica holy shit , would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound .
LLOYD: Do n't do this to me , Harry . I 'm already a wreck . What if Mary oes n't like me ?
HARRY: Look , let 's just go saddle up to the ar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup . A little booze 'll ing back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence .
LLOYD: Two martinis , straight up .
HARRY: I did n't say anything .
LLOYD: Yeah , well I know what you were gon na say and I 'm telling you to shut up in advance .
HARRY: How do you know what I was gon na say ?
LLOYD: I read you like a book .
HARRY: Okay , if you read me like a book then what was I gon na say ?
LLOYD: You were gon na say ( in Harry 's looped
VOICE: 'That 's one fiery bush I would n't mind roasting my weenie in . ' Harry raises his eyebrows , IMPRESSED .
ANDRE: If I could have your attention , please The crowd QUIETS .
MR. SWANSON: Ladies and gentlemen , I give you the Icelandic Snow Owl .
LLOYD: Two more , please . Harry stares at Lloyd with concern .
HARRY: Lloyd , I 've never seen you this uptight . You 've got ta chill out .
LLOYD: I ca n't help it . This is a very important night for me .
HARRY: What are you talking about ? I went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks .
LLOYD: That was a fluke . The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing We 're afraid of the C word .
HARRY: That 's crazy . We live for the C word .
LLOYD: I 'm talking bout commitment .
HARRY: Oh .
LLOYD: Well I 'm ready for commitment , Harry . The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson , I knew she was the one . Some things you feel in your heart , other things you feel in your groin . This girl makes me feel it all in the heart .
HARRY: Wow . You were n't kidding , Lloyd . She 's an angel . Well , what are you waiting for ? Get over there and talk to her .
LLOYD: She 's gon na think I 'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far I came just to see her .
HARRY: You have her briefcase she 's gon na e thrilled to see you .
LLOYD: And then what ? She 'll take it back and that 'll be it . I 'm a nobody . Harry thinks about this a moment .
HARRY: Look , man , you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl . Do n't quit on the last fifty feet .
LLOYD: Wait a second , I have an idea . You go over and introduce yourself . That way you can build me up so when I come along I wo n't have to brag about myself . Tell her I 'm good-looking and I 'm rich and I have a rapist 's wit .
HARRY: I ca n't tell her you 're good looking , Lloyd she 's got eyes . Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini .
LLOYD: Please Harry , I 'm appealing to you as one loser to another . Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over . Please . Harry SIGHS .
HARRY: All right . But you 're gon na owe me a ig one for this .
MARY: I beg your pardon ?
HARRY: The owls . They 're beautiful .
MARY: Oh . Yeah . Are you a bird lover ?
HARRY: Well , I used to have a parakeet , but my main area of expertise is canines that 's dogs to the layperson . She smiles at this .
MARY: Thanks . I love dogs , too . So how are you involved with them ?
HARRY: Oh , I 've trained them , bathed them , clipped them ; I 've even bred them .
MARY: Really ? Any unusual breeding ?
HARRY: Nah , mostly just doggie-style . But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu .
MARY: Really ? That 's weird .
HARRY: Yeah . We called it a Bullshit . Just a little breeder joke .
HELEN: Mary , I do n't believe I 've met you friend .
MARY: Actually , we have n't been introduced yet . I 'm Mary Swanson , and this is my stepmother , Helen .
HARRY: Harry Dunne . Pleasure meeting you oth .
HELEN: I saw you come in earlier , Mr. Dunne . I was hoping we 'd get a chance to meet .
HARRY: You were ?
HELEN: That tuxedo I love a man with a sense of humor . So does Mary .
HARRY: Really ?
MARY: Helen , you 're embarrassing me .
HELEN: Well you are , are n't you ? Poor girl does n't get out enough . So what do you say , Harry ? Are you available ?
HARRY: Oh , I do n't know . You see , my friend your friends for one day . You and Mary will have a ball .
LLOYD: How come you did n't call me over ?
HARRY: Relax , you 're golden . I got you a ate with her tomorrow .
LLOYD: Wha you I it 's I love you , man . I love you !
HARRY: Okay , get a grip , Lloyd . You 're making a scene . Lloyd steps back elated .
LLOYD: This calls for a toast !
HARRY: I think we 've done enough hobnobbing , Lloyd .
J.P. SHAY: Maybe it was just a coincidence .
ANDRE: Do n't be stupid . It 's a message , plain and simple We killed thei ird , now they killed ours .
J.P. SHAY: But how could anybody off a bird with a cork ?
ANDRE: These guys arent ' just anybody . They 're good . Look what they did to Mental . He was the best , and yet he fell right into their web .
J.P. SHAY: But the bastards already got ou money . What the hell more could they want ? Andre runs his fingers through his hair .
ANDRE: I do n't know , god damn it !
LLOYD: Mrs. Christmas Mary Christmas Mrs. Mary Christmas . You
HARRY: Sounds nice , Lloyd , but do n't you think you may be jumping the gun a little ? I mean , who knows , when you get to know her , you may find out she 's not your type .
LLOYD: Impossible . I know my type when I see it . Now let me get this straight , she wants me to meet her at the Avalanche Bar and Grill on Main Street ?
HARRY: That 's what she said . Ten o'clock sharp . This is when Lloyd notices Harry 's get-up .
LLOYD: Time out . Where are going ressed like that .
HARRY: I , uh , thought while you were making your love connection I 'd try my luck on the slopes .
LLOYD: You mean you 're gon na go out in public dressed in tights ?
HARRY: These are n't tights . They 're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers .
LLOYD: But you can see the outline of you who-who . Harry looks down at his crotch .
HARRY: Really ?
LLOYD: Turn sideways . Harry turns his profile against the window .
HARRY: You 're right . I ca n't go out dressed like this .
WAITER: I 'm sorry , we do n't open until eleven . This is disconcerting news to Lloyd .
LLOYD: I 'm meeting someone . Mind if I wait at the bar ?
MARY: Beautiful day , huh , Harry ?
HARRY: Glorious . Mary takes a DEEP BREATH .
MARY: God , it feels so good to get up here . I have n't been outdoors much in the last couple of weeks .
HARRY: Why not ?
MARY: There 's been family problems . I o n't want to bore you with them .
HARRY: Thanks .
MARY: Are you okay ?
HARRY: Sure . I do this all the time
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Hi . Lloyd GRUNTS a hello .
MARY: My god . Harry , are you okay ?
HARRY: I 'm fine , I 'm fine . It 'll come off .
SHAY: You 're luck just ran out , pal .
MARY: This is silly . Let me help you
MIME: GODDAMN IT ! WHAT THE FUCK ? !
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Anyway , after my boyfriend backed into my garage for the third time , I said to myself , 'Run , Cathy , run fo your life before he kills you both ' . Then you know what the klutz does and to be perfectly honest , I o n't eally care . Look , I 'm sorry , but I 'm not very good company today . I 'll say . I have an idea . Why do n't you tell me a little about yourself .
LLOYD: Maybe some other time . Lloyd motions for the BARTENDER .
BARTENDER: Sure . Her family comes in here all the time .
LLOYD: Do you know where she lives ?
BARTENDER: Yeah , they got that big place up on Alpine Drive .
MARY: I 've got to tell you , today was really just what I needed . Thanks a lot , Harry .
HARRY: My pleasure , Mary . She beams and gives him a KISS on the cheek .
MARY: So you 'll pick me up tonight at 7 45 ?
HARRY: Better make it quarter to eight . I 've got a few things to take care of first .
LLOYD: Some best man .
HARRY: It does n't make any sense , Lloyd . She told me ten o'clock sharp . Are you sure you went to the right bar ?
LLOYD: Believe me , it was the right place .
SIGHS: I do n't know , Har , maybe she just had second thoughts .
HARRY: I have a hard time believing that , Lloyd . The girl said she could n't wait to see you again .
LLOYD: What ?
HARRY: It just occurred to me . She must 've meant ten o'clock at night .
LLOYD: Do ya think ?
HARRY: Of course ! Why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning ?
LLOYD: I just figured she was a raging alcoholic . Harry BARKS OUT A LAUGH at their stupidity .
HARRY: Boy , are n't we a couple of beauties ?
LLOYD: I knew there was an explanation . And here I thought she was standing me up .
HARRY: That 'll teach you to jump to conclusions . Anyway , since you have your night all
LLOYD: Will you join me in a good luck toast efore you head out ?
HARRY: Sure thing , pal . Whatever you think will help your chances .
LLOYD: Pretty snazzed out for a movie , are n't you ?
HARRY: Uh it 's for mature audiences . I o n't wan na chance getting turned away at the door .
LLOYD: I see .
HARRY: Mmmmm He GULPS DOWN THE DRINK .
MARY: Hi . Come on in .
HARRY: Be right out .
MARY: I hope you 're not using the toilet . It 's broken .
HARRY: Huh ?
MARY: It does n't flush .
HARRY: Um , no , I was just shaving .
MARY: Shaving ?
HARRY: Yeah ! I was running a little late . Thought this would save time .
MARY: Okay . Well I 'll be in the living oom whenever you 're ready .
HARRY: Come on , flush , you bastard
REPORTER: We 'll be back in a minute with the story of the blind Indiana boy who was duped into buying a dead parakeet .
BLIND BOY: I thought he was real quiet

HARRY: But Mary
MARY: I 'm really sorry , Harry . I promise we 'll do this another time .
HARRY: Great
ANDRE: They 're mine
LLOYD: ..So anyway , as soon as I got to town I tried to look you up but I id n't know your last name .
MARY: I do n't believe it . You really have it .
LLOYD: 'Course I have it . When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport , he makes sure she gets all her luggage , no matter what he has to o. Mary looks at Lloyd and smiles .
MARY: This is incredible . You mean to say you drove two thousand miles just for me ?
LLOYD: Well no I mean , you know , there were other reasons Actually , yeah , I guess I did . She ca n't believe her ears .
MARY: That is the sweetest thing I 've eve heard .
HARRY: It 's all Kharma , Harry . You screw your best friend over and it 's gon na come back to haunt you , plain and simple
LLOYD: Look , Mary , I know this may seem a little sudden but I 've given it a lot of thought You 're the woman I 've been waiting for my whole life , and I 'm not ashamed to admit it Please , let me finish .
DEEP BREATH: I 'm crazy about you . I 've never felt this way about anyone . You make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires .
NERVOUS LAUGH: Listen to me , I feel like a schoolboy again . A schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet , sweet love to you . Suddenly we hear TOILET FLUSHING O.S .
MARY: Oh I thought I heard you talking to someone .
LLOYD: Mary
BLURTING OUT: I desperately want to make love to a schoolboy .
MARY: Maybe I should be going now .
LLOYD: No , that 's not what Imeant . I meant I really like you , Mary . I like you a lot . She smiles at this .
MARY: Lloyd , that 's difficult to say . I mean we hardly
LLOYD: I asked you to be honest , Mary .
MARY: But Lloyd , I really ca n't
LLOYD: Come on , give it to me straight . I ove a long way to see you , the least you can do is level with me . What are my chances ?
MARY: Not good .
LLOYD: You mean not good , like one out of a hundred ?
MARY: I 'd say more like one out of a million .
LLOYD: So you 're telling me there 's a chance ?
MARY: Nicholas what are you doing here ?
ANDRE: I 've been looking for you , Mary .
LLOYD: Husband ?
ANDRE: Are n't you two going to invite me in ?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Hey !
HARRY: You ? What are you doing here ?
ANDRE: Well at least you two got to say your goodbyes .
LLOYD: Who are you ?
ANDRE: Do n't play dumb with me , asshole . I 'm the rightful ower of that iefcase you 've been carrying .
LLOYD: Uh-oh . Mary ca n't believe what 's happening .
MARY: Nicholas , you you motherfucker ! My family trusted you !
ANDRE: Shut up !
LLOYD: Uh , sir , about the briefcase , I want you to know , my friend Harry and I have every intention of reimbursing you .
ANDRE: Open that damn thing !
LLOYD: That 's as good as money , sir . Those are our IOUs . You can add them up yourself . Every penny 's accounted for .
ANDRE: You 're fucking dead !
LLOYD: Now do n't do anything hasty , man .
HARRY: Lloyd , are you home ? We 've got ta talk , man . I have a serious confession to make . Harry comes around the corner and STOPS COLD .
ANDRE: Why do n't you stay and join the party ?
MARY: You mean you two know each other ?
LLOYD: Yeah , we used to be best friends .
HARRY: Until he turned into a backstabber .
LLOYD: Me a backstabber ? You got a lot of nerve . I saw her first .
HARRY: Hey , I could n't help it if she found me irresistable . Mary ROLLS HER EYES at this .
LLOYD: But you knew how crazy I was about her .
HARRY: Yeah , and you knew how crazy I was about Fraida Felcher , but that did n't stop you , did it ?
LLOYD: What are you talking about ?
HARRY: Do n't deny it , Lloyd . Fraida told me the whole sordid story . Lloyd ca n't muster a defense .
LLOYD: Look I was gon na tell you about that . It was gon na be mentioned at the reading of my will . I swear , you can ask my lawyer . Harry glares at him .
HARRY: Well I guess we both learned a little something about each other , did n't we ?
LLOYD: You said it , pal . Maybe we 're not as good friends as we thought we were .
HARRY: Guess not .
LLOYD: I mean , if one beautiful girl could ip us apart like this , then it seems our friendship is n't worth a damn . Maybe we should call it quits right here .
HARRY: Just tell me where to sign , bud .
ANDRE: Okay , which one of you losers wants to die first ? The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD .
HARRY: I would n't pull that trigger if I were you .
ANDRE: Why not ? It 'll look like just anothe Aspen love triangle . You caught the two of them in bed , handcuffed them to the post , murdered them , and killed yourself .
HARRY: Except you 're forgetting one mino etail .
ANDRE: What 's that ? Lloyd and Mary look at Harry , hopeful .
HARRY: If you kill us , you 'd be killing yourself .
ANDRE: Huh ?
HARRY: You see , philosophers believe that we 're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being . In othe words , I am you and you are me , so if you were to kill us you 'd be committing suicide , you unenlightened idiot
ANDRE: Shut up ! Mary sees that they 're in deep shit now .
MARY: What about my husband ? Did you kill him , too ?
HARRY: Husband ? What husband ?
LLOYD: Mary 's married , Harry .
ANDRE: No need to worry about Melvin . Now this is the last time I 'll ask Who wants to die first ? Harry gestures with his head at Mary .
HARRY: Kill her . The bitch should 've told him she was married back at the airport . It would 've saved us a lot of trouble . Andre points the gun at Mary .
LLOYD: No , I 'll go first , Harry . I was the one who got you into this mess . Andre points the gun at Lloyd .
HARRY: No , wait , do me first . I 'm the one who stole your girl , Lloyd . I eserve it .
LLOYD: Jesus Christ ! You killed my best friend , you bastard ! Andre smiles .

LLOYD: Well , anyway , thanks again fo everything . They turn to go , but Barnard CALLS TO THEM
BARNARD: Where are you two headed ?
HARRY: I dunno . I 'm sure we 'll find a traile camp somewhere to call home .
BARNARD: Why not right here ? Harry and Lloyd look at each other , confused .
LLOYD: This joint is a little out of ou udget , Barney .
BARNARD: Oh , I think we might be able to find you a free room somewhere afte all , like you once told me , we 're all from the same mold . You just do n't have any dough right now .

DAVID LYNCH: December 9 , 1983
IRULAN: Father .
EMPEROR: Irulan .
REVEREND MOTHER: We felt his presence .
EMPEROR: I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we 're finished .
REVEREND MOTHER: Their minds are so . They move in strange directions .
EMPEROR: Yes ?
REVEREND MOTHER: Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things . I must sit close to him .
EMPEROR: He will not permit anyone but me to see him . You must be outside this room . Do what you can .
REVEREND MOTHER: I am your Truthsayer , my lord He is here , my lord .
EMPEROR: Leave us .
REVEREND MOTHER: Yes , my Lord .
EMPEROR: We are alone
NAVIGATOR: We have just folded space from Ix
EMPEROR: Yes ? How was your journey ?
NAVIGATOR: Many machines on Ix new machines .
EMPEROR: Oh yes ?
NAVIGATOR: Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent I see many things I see plans within plans .
EMPEROR: Is there a problem ? Usually there is a problem when one of you makes a visit . No answer .
NAVIGATOR: The answer is within the problem
EMPEROR: Yes .
NAVIGATOR: You must share with us .
EMPEROR: The Atreides house is building a secret army ! using a technique unknown to us a technique involving sound . The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad he could threaten me . I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice thus eplacing their enemies the Harkonnens . House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain . Then , at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops .
NAVIGATOR: So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides
EMPEROR: Yes .
NAVIGATOR: Reverend Mother I will give you the Tleilaxu Path .
EMPEROR: Can you hear me ? If this visit has anything to do with spice
NAVIGATOR: LISTEN TO ME ! ! The spice must flow the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years it has enabled you to live two hundred years the spice helps make the sapho juice , which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers the secret side of spice the water of life .
EMPEROR: I can assure you
NAVIGATOR: Do not interrupt ! ! ! Do not speak lightly of the spice ONE SMALL POINT
EMPEROR: You mean , of course , Duke Leto Atreides his father .
PAUL: Here we are now nineteen light years eyond
THUFIR: Those sounds could be imitated .
PAUL: I 'd know the difference . Paul rises and turns to face them .
THUFIR: Yes . Perhaps he would at that .
PAUL: My father sent you to test me . Music then ? Thufir scowls .
GURNEY: No music . I 'm packing this for the crossing . Shield practice .
PAUL: Shield practice ? Gurney we had practice this morning.. I 'm not in the mood .
GURNEY: Not in the mood ? ! Mood 's a thing fo cattle and love play not fighting .
PAUL: I 'm sorry Gurney .
GURNEY: Not sorry enough . Gurney draws his knife .
PAUL: What 's gotten into Gurney ? He 's not faking .
GURNEY: Good the slow blade penetrates the shield but look down .
PAUL: Would you really have drawn my blood ?
GURNEY: If you 'd fought one whit below you abilities I 'd have scratched you a good one .
PAUL: Things have been so serious here lately .
GURNEY: Yes . I sensed the play in you lad , but this can no longer be play . Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis ! Arrakis is real . The Harkonnens are real .
PAUL: Dr. Yueh , do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis ?
DR. YUEH: I have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen only 125 meters long .
PAUL: Only ? ! They smile at each other .
DR. YUEH: There are have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert far from where we 'll be in Arakeen . The desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden . Why ?
PAUL: The storms and the worms . Is it true , that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour ?
YUEH: It can render flesh to dust in minutes . And these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere . Our body shields wo n't have enough power to operate in the open air on Arrakis .
PAUL: Well , how do the Fremen survive there ?
YUEH: We do n't know much about the Fremen They live in the deep desert some of them in the cities and they have blue- within-blue eyes
PAUL: The eyes yes , yes saturation of the lood by the spice melange . Could the spice affect us in other ways ?
THUFIR: Many dangers exist on Arrakis . For one , we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily .
PAUL: The Harkonnens are our enemies , yes but ehind them , I suspect , is the Emperor .
THUFIR: You will make a formidable Duke ! Paul bows .
PAUL: I know . But if it is a trap then why are we going ?
THUFIR: We have our new army . Dr. Yueh , put the weirding module on him .
GURNEY: Precise control .
PAUL: The bull that killed my grandfather is this an evil omen ?
DUNCAN: Paul . I was on my way to say goodbye to you . I have to go on ahead .
PAUL: Why ? I wish you were coming with us .
DUNCAN: It 's something for your father . He wants to talk to you . I 'll see you in Arrakis . May the hand of God be with you .
PAUL: May the hand of God be with us all , Duncan .
DUKE LETO: Thank you for joining me , Paul . It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us .
PAUL: I want you to be proud of me .
DUKE LETO: I 'll miss the sea but a person needs new experiences they jar something deep inside , allowing him to grow . Without change , something sleeps inside us and seldom awakens The sleeper must awaken .
PAUL: Arrakis Dune Desert PlanetArrakis Desert Planet moving moving .
VOICE: The second moon , your moon
BEAUTIFUL GIRL: Tell me of your homeworld , Usul .
JESSICA: I know she has come to test him no man has ever been tested with the box only Bene Gesserit women . I may lose my son .
PAUL: Arrakis Dune Desert planet moving moving . CU Paul 's face .
REVEREND MOTHER: We 'll salvage what we can but I can tell you.. dear God for the father nothing .
JESSICA: Paul ? This is very important
PAUL: Kwisatz Haderach ? For the father nothing ?
REVEREND MOTHER: Jessica You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides Jessica !
JESSICA: It meant so much to him
REVEREND MOTHER: You thought only of a Duke 's desire for a son ? Desires do n't figure in this ! An Atreides daughter could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach . We may lose both blood lines now .
JESSICA: I vowed never to regret my decision . I 'll pay for my own mistakes .
REVEREND MOTHER: And your son will pay with you .
JESSICA: Paul , this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam . She is going to observe you Please
REVEREND MOTHER: Jessica , you know it must be done . I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace .
JESSICA: Your Reverence .
PAUL: What does she fear ? What about my Father ?
JESSICA: Paul please , Paul listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you .
REVEREND MOTHER: Now you come here .
PAUL: She 's using The Voice . No . She sees him struggling .
REVEREND MOTHER: Some strength there . Surprising ! Come here .
PAUL: What 's in the box ?
REVEREND MOTHER: Pain .
PAUL: The Voice again .
REVEREND MOTHER: I hold at your neck the gom jabbar . Do n't pull away or you 'll feel that poison . A Duke 's son must know about many poisons this one kills only animals .
PAUL: Are you suggesting a Duke 's son is an animal ?
REVEREND MOTHER: Let us say I suggest you may be human . Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts . Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box . If you do so you will die . You will feel an itching there see ? Now the itching becomes burning heat , upon heat , upon heat .
PAUL: It burns .
REVEREND MOTHER: SILENCE SILENCE .
PAUL: I must not fear . Fear is the mind-killer . Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration . I will face my fear I will permit it to pass over me and through me .
REVEREND MOTHER: You feel the flesh crisping ?
REVEREND MOTHER: NO ! ! ENOUGH ! ! Kull wahad ! No woman child ever withstood that much . I must have wanted you to fail . Take your hand out of the box and look at it , young human . Do it !
PAUL: I see the truth of it .
REVEREND MOTHER: Could he be the one ? Maybe but will he be ours to control ? You know when people speak the truth ?
PAUL: I know it .
REVEREND MOTHER: Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams . I only want to know one thing . Do they come true ?
PAUL: Not all of them I know which ones will .
REVEREND MOTHER: Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach .
PAUL: What is it ?
REVEREND MOTHER: The person who can be many places at once the one who bridges space and time . He will look where we can not .
PAUL: Where ?
REVEREND MOTHER: Do you know of the Water of Life ? the Truthsayer drug ?
PAUL: I have heard of it .
REVEREND MOTHER: It is very dangerous very painful . The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within . There is a place terrifying to us to women . It is said a man will come the Kwisatz Haderach he will go where we can not Many men have tried
PAUL: Did they try and fail ?
REVEREND MOTHER: They tried and died . Jessica !
PAUL: I 've heard enough of my safety What about my father ? I heard you talking . You speak as if he was dead . Well , he is n't !
JESSICA: Paul ! She tries to hold him .
PAUL: Well he is n't and he wo n't die Tell me he wo n't die !
REVEREND MOTHER: What can be done has been done .
PAUL: MOTHER ! Tell me !
PITER: It is by will alone I set my mind in motion . It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed - The lips acquire stains - The stains become a warning - It is by will alone I set my mind in motion .
BARON: Piter . Piter moves up to the Baron .
PITER: The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon , Baron , and I have here your answer from Duke Leto .
BARON: What does Leto say , Piter ?
PITER: He wishes to inform you that Vendetta as he puts it , using the ancient tongue , the art of Kanly is still alive . He does not wish to meet or speak with you .
BARON: I made my peace gesture the forms of Kanly have been obeyed . He throws down the cylinder .
PITER: As you instructed me , I have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t
BARON: My plan !
PITER: The plan to crush the Atreides . Feyd , Rabban go quietly no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor 's aid to the Baron . The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron and the Emperor .
DOCTOR: Put the pick in there Pete And turn it round real neat . His assistant does so .
BARON: You 're so beautiful my Baron Your skin , love to me Your diseases lovingly cared fo For all eternity .
FEYD: Who is the traitor ?
BARON: I wo n't tell you who the traitor is o when we 'll attack . However , the Duke will die before these eyes and he 'll know that it is I Baron Vladimir Harkonnen who encompasses his doom .
JESSICA: I must not fear . Fear is the mind- killer the little death that brings total obliteration The door of the spaceship closes .
DUKE LETO: Soon they 'll begin to fold space .
PAUL: Far off in the control rooms . Travelling without moving . They wait . 56 .
ATREIDES TECHNICIAN: Harkonnens .
THUFIR: Why is n't the shield up yet ?
DR. YUEH: Listen here . You can here the people of Arrakeen outside . Can you here the cry `` Soo Soo Sook '' of the water sellers ?
JESSICA: So many reminders of the scarcity of water .
DR. YUEH: Have you noticed the line of palms along the wall the Harkonnen put them in to flaunt their water wealth in front of these people . Each day those palms take enough water to sustain the life of one hundred men .
JESSICA: The way you say Harkonnen I did n't know you had so much reason to hate them .
DR. YUEH: My wife you did n't know my wife they
JESSICA: Forgive me His wife was Bene Gesserit too the signs are al over him . They must have killed here .
DR. YUEH: I 'm sorry I 'm unable to talk about it .
JESSICA: He 's hiding something holding something ack . It 's not just his wife He 's a good man though . He 's probably trying to save my feelings I could use The Voice make him tell me It would only shame him . I must place more trust in my friends .
PAUL: Spice
SHADOUT MAPES: I am the Shadout Mapes the housekeeper .
PAUL: A Fremen Could she be the operator ? No
SHADOUT MAPES: I must cleanse the way between us . You saved my life and we Fremen pay ou debts . It 's known to us that you 've a traitor in your midst . Who it is we can not say but we 're certain of it .
PAUL: A traitor
THUFIR: Set up a sonar probe immediately !

The machine FLASHES several bright irregula
DUKE LETO: The attempt failed Harkonnen captives have already been taken . We must crush the Harkonnen machine on Arrakis . You all know what to do . Gurney ! We desperately need more spice miners many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle . We need spice drivers , weather scanners , dune men any with open sand experience . You must persuade them to enlist with us .
GURNEY: They shall come all for violence thei faces shall sup as the east wind . And they shall gather the captivity of the sand .
DUKE LETO: Very moving , Gurney . On your way and take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I arrive . We will not be prisoners here in this place .
GURNEY: Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I forth to my work .
JESSICA: I must speak with you Leto !
SHADOUT MAPES: I am the Shadout Mapes , your housekeeper , Noble Born . What are your orders .
JESSICA: You may refer to me as `` my lady . '' I am not noble born . I 'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto mother of the hei designate . `` Shadout '' that 's an ancient word .
MAPES: You know the ancient tongues ?
JESSICA: I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa , all the hunting languages .
MAPES: As the legend says .
JESSICA: That 's it ! The Missionaria Protectiva has een here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need . And that day has come . I must play out this sham . I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother . Miseces prejin . Mapes takes a step backward to flee .
MAPES: My lady , I the weapon was sent as a gift if you should prove to be the one .
JESSICA: And the means of my death should I prove otherwise . Now we will see which way the decision tips .
MAPES: Do you know this my lady ?
JESSICA: It could only be one thing . It 's a crysknife .
MAPES: Say it not lightly Do you know its meaning ?
JESSICA: Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me , to ask that one question . Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer . Shadout is Chakobsa knife , in Chakobsa is maker of death . It 's a maker Mapes SCREAMS with elation and grief .
MAPES: My lady , when one has lived with prophecy for so long , the moment of revelation is a shock . Mapes sheathes the blade slowly
JESSICA: There 's more here yes ! Mapes , you 've sheathed that blade unblooded .
MAPES: Take the water of my life !
KYNES: So , this is Leto the Just
GURNEY: I hope I made myself clear . You may call him `` The Duke , '' `` My lord , '' or `` Sire . '' And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind `` Noble Born . ''
KYNES: Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders Gurney turns and activates a device
DUKE LETO: So you are Dr. Kynes , the Imperial Ecologist ?
KYNES: I prefer the more ancient term , planetologist Noble Born .
DUKE LETO: This is my son , Paul .
PAUL: Are you a Fremen ?
KYNES: I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor . I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change .
PAUL: He 's hiding something .
DUKE LETO: I understand we have you to thank fo these stillsuits , Doctor .
KYNES: They are Fremen suits . I hope they fit well , my lord .
PAUL: `` Your gift is a blessing of the river . ''
KYNES: The Mahdi will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing . Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot . They mean no harm . With your permission , I will check the security of your suits . Gurney and the guard move forward warily .
GURNEY: The Duke is to be addresses as
KYNES: Basically
GURNEY: Sire !
DUKE LETO: It 's all right Gurney . Gurney steps back .
GURNEY: Yes , Sire .
KYNES: It 's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system . Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second . The salt is separated . Breathing and walking provide the pumping action . The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck . Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads . Should you be in the open desert , remembe to breathe in through your mouth , out through the nose tubes .
DUKE LETO: My thanks .
KYNES: With your permission
PAUL: No .
PAUL: No one . It seemed the proper way .
KYNES: That it is . He shall know your ways as if born to them .
GURNEY: We 're wasting time , Sire .
JESSICA: I must speak with you Leto ! 91 . Through 92 .
KYNES: Southeast over the Shield Wall . That 's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his harvesting .
PAUL: Will we see a worm ?
KYNES: Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms .
PAUL: Always ?
KYNES: Always .
PAUL: Why do they come ?
KYNES: To protect their territory . Vibrations attract them .
PAUL: I 've registered him now a knife is a sheath on his left arm He 's strong a person born to command He 's hiding many things . Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice ?
GURNEY: The young master is a trained Mentat , an advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the Universe . Kynes takes a second look at young Paul .
KYNES: As I said they defend the spice sands . As to their relationship with the spice who knows . 97 . Through 97A .
GURNEY: Dust cloud ahead , Sire .
KYNES: That 's it spice mining no othe cloud quite like it . See the spotters ove it ? They 're watching for wormsign the telltale sand waves . Seismic probes on the surface , too Sire worms can travel too deep for their waves to show Looks like a good patch of spice .
DUKE LETO: Wormsign ? Is it wormsign ?
KYNES: Yes ! worm . Big one ! You 've got sharp eyes Sire . May I ?
VOICE: Who calls Pad Nine ?
GURNEY: Do n't mention the Duke This is an uncoded channel .
KYNES: Unlisted flight northeast of you wormsign on intercept course estimated contact fifteen minutes .
VOICE: Have sighting confirmed . Stand by for fix . Contact in sixteen minutes minus . Very precise estimate . Who is on that unlisted flight ? Kynes clicks off the radio .
DUKE LETO: What happens now ?
KYNES: The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester . Try and get in close ove the harvester you 'll find this interesting Sire .
VOICE: Spotter control no sign of the carryall it is n't answering . Everyone looks at one another .
GURNEY: The worm is eight minutes away , Sire .
VOICE: Spotter control give me a report by the numbers .
DUKE LETO: Damn it Harkonnens .
VOICE: Ordered by whom ?
DUKE LETO: Duke Leto Atreides . Gurney and Paul turn to each other , worried .
VOICE: Yes yes , Sire !

VOICE: Full crew twenty-six men but Sire , we ca n't leave this spice
DUKE LETO: Damn the spice ! Get out of there .
KYNES: I ca n't see him yet but he 's very close
DUKE LETO: Damn sloppy really damn sloppy .
GURNEY: Come on boys come on . We 're going to be heavy , Sire .
KYNES: Here he is We 've got to go .
PAUL: Spice ! pure un-refined spice !
KYNES: Bless the Maker and his water Bless the coming and going of him . May his passage cleanse the world .
DUKE LETO: What 's that you 're saying ?
KYNES: Nothing .
PAUL: Liet ?
KYNES: You are about to witness something few have seen watch ! Watch ! Paul looks down as the Duke banks over the harvester .
GURNEY: Gods , what a monster .
DUKE LETO: Someone is going to pay for this I promise .
KYNES: This Duke is more concerned over his men than the spice ! I must admit against all better judgement I like this Duke .
DUKE LETO: Duncan ! What have you discovered about the Fremen , Duncan tell me . Why have n't we heard from you ?
DUNCAN: My lord I suspect so much . I think they are the allies we seek they are strong and fierce they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly . As you know , the Imperium has never been able to take a census of the Fremen . Everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert . My lord , I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet that the Fremen exist in vast numbers vast numbers and it is they that control Arrakis . 115. through 116 .
DUKE LETO: Sleep well my son .
PAUL: Father ! father drugged
DUKE LETO: What happened ? What ? The shield !
YUEH: I 've brought House Atreides down . I 've destroyed the new army 's weirding modules .
DUKE LETO: Why ? The generator WHINES lower and lowe
YUEH: I wish to kill a man not you , my dea Duke , but the Baron . You were dead already but you will be close to the Baron before you die . You will be tied and drugged but you can still attack .

JESSICA: Leto where are you ?
BARON: Goodbye , Jessica and goodbye to your sweet son . I want to spit once on you head just some spittle on your face what a luxury .
NEFUD: What are your orders , Piter ?
PITER: Take them to the desert , as the traito suggested and worms will destroy the evidence . Their bodies must never be found .

DUKE LETO: A little closer . The water of my life for Paul .
BARON: He 's crying ! He 's crying ! He 's crying , Piter . What does he mean ?
DUKE LETO: Now !
JESSICA: Leto ! Leto !
PAUL: I know I have NO FEELINGS ! ! Why ?
BARON: I 'm alive ! ! ! I 'm alive ! ! !
PAUL: I ca n't maintain any altitude we 'll never reach the safety of rock . Maybe that small rock .

There will be flowing water here open to the sky and ich green oases . For the spice there will always be some desert . There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men . We Fremen have a saying `` God created Arrakis to train the faithful . '' One can not go against the word of God .
ALIA: And how can this be ? There are three powerful drum hits .
