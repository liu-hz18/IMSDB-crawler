WEAPONS DEVELOPER: Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear . For this test we made it audible that was the tone you heard before the explosion the tone was the trigger .

RACHEL: Yeah ? How do you know Kyle 's dad is n't there ?
JERRY: Well , you 're not wearing a ring and you have n't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train .

NIKOLAI: ` Sentimental value ' . I 've heard of that . Anna puts her helmet on .
ANNA: No .
NIKOLAI: Nor me . Chauffeurs do n't get invited . You want to go for a drink instead ? Anna mounts her bike .
ANNA: It 's Christmas . Everything 's closed . Nikolai smiles .
NIKOLAI: Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up , you know ?
STEPAN: Anna , how come is it that you oyfriend is n't here to carve ? Stepan takes a large sip of vodka .
ANNA: I do n't live with Oliver any more , Uncle Stepan . I 'm living back here for a bit .
HELEN: For as long as you want .
STEPAN: I knew he would run away from you .
ANNA: He did n't run away . You make me sound like a burning building .
STEPAN: Black men always run away .
HELEN: Oh Stepan !
STEPAN: What ? I am allowed to be honest ?
HELEN: He was a doctor , Stepan .
ANNA: What the hell has that got to do with it ? A pause . Stepan sips his vodka .
STEPAN: It is not natural to mix race and ace . That is why your baby died inside you . Anna slams her napkin onto the table .
HELEN: Stepan , shut up ! Please Anna .
ANNA: It 's Christmas . I 'm thirty-one . A pause . Anna blows smoke , clearly upset .
HELEN: Anna , you know what he 's like .
ANNA: I do n't give a damn about Stepan . Who has that poor baby got in the whole world ? Helen reacts .
HELEN: I knew this would happen .
ANNA: Good . Fine . So you know everything .
HELEN: Anna , she is n't your responsibility .
ANNA: The baby is my responsibility until I hand her over to the mother . The mother is dead .
HELEN: Then it 's up to the prope authorities . Anna smiles as if in agreement .
ANNA: The proper authorities will all be skiing until after New Year .
HELEN: It 's part of the grieving .
ANNA: What grieving ?
HELEN: In the last year you 've lost you father and you lost a baby .
ANNA: I 'm not hungry .
KIRILL: He 's called Goofy Goofy yeah . So the coast is clear , yeah ? What ? I said ` coast ' .
OZIM: The driver stays down here . Kirill smiles and shakes his head .
KIRILL: You really think I do this kind of thing ? Kirill puts his hand on Nikolai 's shoulde
OZIM: Hey , hey , hey Ekrem , sakim , durgun , durgun .
EKREM: I got tickets , Ozim . It 's with Chelsea . They said there was no tickets but I got tickets for the Chelsea game .
OZIM: OK , OK , OK. You go and watch a DVD , yeah ?
KIRILL: He knows to say he has n't seen us , ight Ozim ? Ozim finds the key to the kitchen .
OZIM: He do n't know anything . He 's touched by the angels . Ozim opens the kitchen door .
KIRILL: That 's him . Kirill crosses himself .
OZIM: Hey , hey , show some respect for a dead man .
KIRILL: Respect ? This is respect .
NIKOLAI: Have you got a hair dryer ?
NIKOLAI: You 'd better burn that .
KIRILL: Are n't you going to weight him down or something ?
NIKOLAI: If you want to dump a body , this is the place . The currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier .
SEMYON: Ah . My dear ! I was n't expecting you so early .
ANNA: Is it OK ?
SEMYON: Where is the original ?
ANNA: I 'm going to keep it . Maybe give it to Tatiana 's daughter someday .
SEMYON: I will need my spectacles and a clear head . Today I broke my rules and drank vodka . Tomorrow I will translate it . He folds the papers carefully .
ANNA: Not far . I can drop by and pick it up .
SEMYON: Then maybe I can drive you home .
ANNA: I 'm fine . I 'm on my motorbike . Semyon stares at her for a moment .
SEMYON: So what will happen to the poo child ?
ANNA: After Christmas , they 'll do a missing persons report .
SEMYON: Who will ?
ANNA: The police .
MARIA: Grandpa .
SEMYON: Hey , hey , Maria , go back to bed .
MARIA: I 'm too sad . Next Christmas is n't for another hundreds and hundreds of days .
SEMYON: But you have had so many presents . The girl wafts Semyon 's cigar smoke .
MARIA: You should n't smoke , Grandpa .
SEMYON: I know . Semyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar .
KIRILL: We 're partners now , man , you know ?
NIKOLAI: Yeah , yeah , I know .
KIRILL: Hey , Papa , what did I do ? This is Merry Christmas or what ? Semyon kicks him hard in the guts again .
NIKOLAI: I think he 's had enough .
SEMYON: Who the fuck are you to tell me enough ? Nikolai 's face hardens .
NIKOLAI: We 're partners . Nikolai looks down at Kirill .
SEMYON: I hired you as a driver
NIKOLAI: Well , you got more than a driver .
SEMYON: I have no idea what business you 're talking about . Now get out .
NIKOLAI: You 've got water in it .
ANNA: Water ? What makes you think that ?
NIKOLAI: The postmen used these . In my village . When I was a boy . Russian copy of BMW flat twin .
ANNA: Just across the park .
NIKOLAI: I 'm a driver . I even do limousines . Look Nikolai opens the rear car door .
ANNA: You get used to it .
NIKOLAI: I did n't faint , but it was close .
ANNA: How many have you got ? Nikolai half shrugs . Pause .
NIKOLAI: Yeah , I know , I know , it 's just it makes me upset , you know ? Thinking about it . This time of year . They 're back in Yekaterinburg . In the forests . Near the mountains . A long pause .
ANNA: Left here . Nikolai turns .
NIKOLAI: I 'm sort of freelance .
ANNA: You said he 'd fire you .
NIKOLAI: I meet lots of girls called Tatiana .
ANNA: She was pregnant .
NIKOLAI: In that case , no , I never heard of her .
ANNA: She died last night on my shift .
NIKOLAI: I thought you did birth .
ANNA: Sometimes birth and death go together . She had needle punctures all ove oth arms . Dehydration , emaciation . Early presentation of syphilis . Probably a prostitute . At the age of fourteen .
NIKOLAI: You know what ? I hate the rain . This time of year . You ever been to Russia at Christmas ? Man , snow that covers your whole house .
ANNA: You think Semyon 's son knew her ?
NIKOLAI: Like I said , I 'm a driver . I go left , I go right , I go straight ahead . That 's it .
ANNA: Just here is great .
NIKOLAI: Christmas present .
OFFICER: We think he might be Russian Mafia .
YURI: He is actually a Chechen . He is also a member of the vory v zakone . The stars on the knees mean he would never kneel before anyone .
OFFICER: There was something else . It was inside the body . Chest cavity .
HELEN: Anna ?
ANNA: What ? Stepan , what ? I 'm late for work .
HELEN: It was on the dresser .
ANNA: Mum , you ca n't go through my things .
HELEN: You wanted him to translate it . Anna gets up to grab the diary .
ANNA: And he said he would n't do it so I 've found somebody else . Stepan explodes .
STEPAN: No Anna ! You do n't go to someone else with this ! You do n't go to anyone ! Nasilovanie , it means rape . Iglah , it means needle . Prostitutcia , perhaps you can guess .
HELEN: Anna , Stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone . Do you know what that means ?
ANNA: Just because I 'm back in this room does n't mean I 'm twelve again .
HELEN: You never listened to me even then !
ANNA: Look , if I do n't find a relative in the next few days they 'll put Christine out for fostering . Once she 's in the system , she 'll neve get out again . A pause .
HELEN: Who named her Christine ?
ANNA: I had to call her something . It sounds like Christmas . She 's very beautiful . Helen is now deeply concerned .
HELEN: If I can persuade Stepan to translate it , will you leave the est to the police ?
ANNA: Tell him I 've heard bad words efore .
HELEN: Your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease . There 's no cure once they 've touched you . A pause . Anna smiles .
ANNA: Momma , this is London .
ALBANIAN: OK , boss is here . Boss , boss . You make him happy
KIRILL: So he said to me , ` who is this driver guy ? ' I laughed so hard . Kirill knocks on the door hard .
NIKOLAI: And what did he say ?
KIRILL: You know my dad . He did n't say nothing . But his eyes looked impressed .
ALBANIAN: Kirill !
KIRILL: Get out of the fucking way , you lack gypsy baboon .
KIRILL: OK , which one you going to fuck ! ?
NIKOLAI: What 's it to you ?
KIRILL: Serious . Pick one .
NIKOLAI: I 'm just enjoying myself , man
KIRILL: You hear me ? You 're going to fuck one of these girls .
NIKOLAI: OK , OK , Jesus
KIRILL: You 're going to fuck one of these girls right now . That 's an order .
NIKOLAI: What ? What 's the matter with you ?
KIRILL: Come on Nikolai . Who are you going to fuck ? A pause .
NIKOLAI: You 've drunk enough Kirill .
KIRILL: Enough ?
NIKOLAI: Her . Kirill smiles .
KIRILL: You did OK ! You did OK .
NIKOLAI: Yeah ? Nikolai glares at Kirill .
GIRL: Kirilenko .
NIKOLAI: Where are you from ?
GIRL: Ukraine .
NIKOLAI: Where ? Which village ? Which town ?
GIRL: Irpen . Outside Kiev .
NIKOLAI: Stay alive a little longer .
SEMYON: Hello Anna . I came on tiptoes .
ANNA: How did you get in here ?
SEMYON: There are always open doors , Anna Ivanovna .
ANNA: You 're not allowed in here .
SEMYON: Please Anna , let me speak .
ANNA: What does it say about him ? Semyon looks up , his eyes filled with tears .
SEMYON: Many bad things . A pause .
ANNA: I do n't care about him . I care about the baby .
SEMYON: Of course . Of course . And that is the baby ?
NURSE: Anna ?
ANNA: It 's OK . He 's just leaving . Semyon puts his hat onto his head .
SEMYON: You know where I am , Anna Ivanovna . He turns .
STEPAN: like potato sacks . Kirill came down after me and he hit me until I was bleeding . Then he tried to ape me but he could n't do it He just got madder and madder and kept hitting me . In the end his father came down . It was the fathe who raped me . He shouted at his son'if you do n't break a horse , it will never be tame , Kirill ' .
HELEN: Hello dear . How was your night ?
ANNA: No . Anna gently pushes Helen back into her seat .
HELEN: What 's wrong ?
ANNA: He came to see me . Silence .
STEPAN: I told you this would happen ! I told you !
HELEN: Sit down Stepan .
STEPAN: The devil is loose now . Everyone begins to talk at once
ANNA: I know it 's my fault
HELEN: It 's no one 's fault
STEPAN: They are in this room now . They are cancer
HELEN: We should just sit down calmly and think
STEPAN: I have a friend from Ukraine who owns a gun .
HELEN: Stepan ! !
STEPAN: from the war in Afghanistan .
HELEN: Do n't talk about guns Anna suddenly stands up .
ANNA: Shut up both of you ! ! ! Silence . Everyone catches their breath .
STEPAN: We all know what he would have done .
HELEN: And then he would have been practical .
STEPAN: He would ask if there were bullets for the gun .
HELEN: No ! This is n't our world . We 're just ordinary people .
STEPAN: I dealt with the vory v zakone when I worked for the KGB .
ANNA: You never worked for the fucking
HELEN: Anna !
STEPAN: I was an auxiliary !
HELEN: Please ! A stand off . Finally
ANNA: The diary . In return he 'll give us an address for Tatiana 's family . For Christine 's family . A pause . They all look to each other .
HELEN: And that 's all he wants ? Stepan is utterly astounded .
STEPAN: You can not do deals with these people !
HELEN: This is n't a deal . It 's an exchange of information .
STEPAN: Have you forgotten already what I just read to you ?
HELEN: We must be practical .
ANNA: Stepan , I think he was threatening to harm Christine .
HELEN: Then it 's settled .
STEPAN: No ! ! No ! ! No ! !
HELEN: Stepan , this is n't our world . We are ordinary people .
STEPAN: She was an ordinary person .
KIRILL: Hey , come on , Nikolai , I 've got a Christmas present for you .
NIKOLAI: From where ?
KIRILL: ` From where ? ' From where you do n't ask . Give it here
NIKOLAI: Import-export sounds good . Kirill laughs .
KIRILL: You bet it 's fucking good
SEMYON: Your friend Soyka is dead .
KIRILL: Yeah ? So what ? What 's that got to do with me ?
SEMYON: Do n't lie to me ! !
KIRILL: I swear I do n't know nothing about it
SEMYON: I said , do n't lie to me !
NIKOLAI: Your dad is right , Kirill . There 's no point lying to him .
KIRILL: Shut your fucking mouth !
NIKOLAI: Your dad always knows the truth anyway . Nikolai and Semyon survey each other .
SEMYON: I do n't have to worry ?
NIKOLAI: I disposed of the body myself . The police wo n't find a thing .
SEMYON: My son commits a murder ?
NIKOLAI: The vory code says you do n't talk to anybody about your captain . Kirill is my captain . Semyon circles Nikolai .
SEMYON: I decide what is right and what is wrong . You do not kill a vor fo no reason .
NIKOLAI: You know as well as I do Soyka was talking to the police .
SEMYON: For a driver , you are well informed .
NIKOLAI: I 've got connections with the Chechens who export cars . Soyka was speaking to the Russian desk . Scotland Yard .
KIRILL: Papa , I swear to you , I was going to
SEMYON: Shut up !
NIKOLAI: That 's OK. Kirill has got me .
SEMYON: Get these boxes out of sight .
KIRILL: You heard him , patsan ! Get these oxes out of sight .
ANNA: How the hell can you eat ?
STEPAN: I 'm hungry .
ANNA: That 's their driver .
HELEN: Tell me you have n't done anything idiculous
NIKOLAI: Meet in a public place with lots of people around . Very wise . He smiles at Helen .
STEPAN: When I was in the KGB , we knew how to deal with scum like you . Nikolai smiles .
NIKOLAI: When you were in what ?
HELEN: Shush , Stepan . Anna ?
ANNA: Now you give me the address .
NIKOLAI: What address ?
ANNA: Tatiana 's family .
NIKOLAI: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
STEPAN: I told you ! I knew they would do this . Anna gets to her feet .
HELEN: Anna ! No ! Come back here !
ANNA: She was fourteen ! Read the diary ! She was fourteen when he raped her ! Nikolai casually hits the key fob of his car .
NIKOLAI: Anger is very dangerous . It makes people do stupid things . Forget any of this ever happened . You 're in the wrong place , Anna Ivanovna . He gestures at the burger restaurant .
SEMYON: It is good to have someone who I can trust to do simple tasks .
NIKOLAI: Nasdrovia . After a moment .
SEMYON: So what was the lie that Soyka was spreading about my son ? Nikolai looks anxious .
NIKOLAI: It was nothing important .
SEMYON: Kirill had him killed for nothing important ? Semyon pours two more vodkas .
NIKOLAI: I do n't want to repeat it .
SEMYON: For me you will repeat it .
NIKOLAI: That he is a drunk . And that he is also a queer .
SEMYON: My only son .
NIKOLAI: So why do n't you go home ?
SEMYON: The cold gets into my bones . A pause .
NIKOLAI: FSB . They are called FSB now .
SEMYON: Whatever they call them they are worse even than the KGB were . Maybe the KGB and the vory v zakone were partners in a marriage . We had ules , they had rules . He swigs some more vodka .
NIKOLAI: I met him .
SEMYON: So you know what he looks like . Semyon peers at Nikolai .
NIKOLAI: I thought I 'd bring it back before it got stolen . Lot of villains around . Sorry about the chain . Anna is about to walk quickly away
ANNA: You read the diary ?
NIKOLAI: I told you . I 'm just a driver .
ANNA: You look the other way .
NIKOLAI: I 'm a camera . The pictures stay in my head .
ANNA: Why did you bring me this ?
NIKOLAI: I do n't know . I was passing . After a long moment Anna turns away .
ANNA: I do n't know .
NIKOLAI: Well , he 's a brave old man . That 's for sure . A pause .
EKREM: Hey ! Hey Kabuka Chelsea ! Fuck you ! ! Yeah you ! Aliverisme ! ! Fucker !
CHECHEN: For my brother
DISHWASHER: Guy out the back . Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka .
SEMYON: So what did they say ?
OZIM: They were going to kill me . Those Chechens are savages . Ozim is reliving the ordeal .
SEMYON: What did they say about my son ?
OZIM: They said they would spare me only if I delivered Kirill to them .
SEMYON: You are being very honest .
OZIM: I fear you more than I fear them .
SEMYON: Never again do business with any member of my family behind my back .
OZIM: Never . I will never listen to Kirill again . I swear
SEMYON: Do they know where to find Kirill ?
OZIM: They are like wolves .
SEMYON: Do they know what he looks like ? Ozim shakes his head .
OZIM: No . They have just arrived from the mountains .
SEMYON: Then tell them you will delive Kirill to them .
ANNA: Mum I ca n't get hold of Stepan .
HELEN: Why do you want to ?
ANNA: I need to check something with him .
HELEN: Anna
ANNA: He 's not at home , do you know where else he might be ? Helen simply stares at her .
HELEN: Anna . Have n't you had enough excitement ?
ANNA: I think I 've worked out who Christine 's father is .
HELEN: Why does it matter ? ! !
ANNA: It matters to me ! !
HELEN: You enjoy this . A pause .
NIKOLAI: What are you doing here ? A pause .
ANNA: I do n't know . I was passing .
KIRILL: If you 're passing , you pass . You keep going , bitch . Nikolai , come on
ANNA: Family is important to you people is n't it ?
KIRILL: 'You people ' ? What the hell is she talking about ? Music swells from the restaurant .
ANNA: Tell Semyon the baby I delivered on Christmas Eve is his daughter .
KIRILL: What did she say ? !
ANNA: When he raped her she was a virgin . Then they gave her pills . Semyon has to be the father !
NIKOLAI: ) She 's a civilian !
ANNA: She was fourteen ! She was a child !
KIRILL: You do n't use my father 's name ! You do n't say that filth about him
ANNA: Tell him what I said .
NIKOLAI: There is nothing to tell . Slaves give birth to slaves Kirill yells .
KIRILL: Come on Nikolai ! ! He turns to Anna
KIRILL: That girl you fucked in front of me you remember her ? The Ukrainian bitch ?
NIKOLAI: No .
KIRILL: So they kick down the door . These are ordinary fucking police . They ask for her by name and they take her away . Some fucking punter must have given them her name . What gives the police the right to take our women , huh ?
SEMYON: She is one hundred years old .
KIRILL: Come on , Nikolai , help me .
SEMYON: No . He stays here . I want to talk business .
KIRILL: What business ?
SEMYON: Go to the cellar Kirill . And take your time .
NIKOLAI: Thank you . Papa .
SEMYON: Tell him I changed my mind about the brandy .
KIRILL: My dad swapped a little Georgian girl for this stuff .
NIKOLAI: He offered me stars . I accepted them .
KIRILL: ) You think I did n't know already ? He told me before . It was my fucking idea . He said there are a lot of things I have to teach you . Nikolai nods . Kirill gets to his feet .
NIKOLAI: Yeah .
KIRILL: What ? A pause .
NIKOLAI: I know , Kirill .
KIRILL: Where the fuck are you going ? We 've got to celebrate . Help me with these bottles .
NIKOLAI: Your dad do n't need the bottles any more . As Nikolai departs Kirill calls after him .
KIRILL: Hey ! We 're still partners , right ? Thunder and lightning !
VALERY: We can see that you were in prison in Siberia . And that you were a thief .
NIKOLAI: My father was a government worker . He fixed the cars of officials . I egan by selling the spare parts when I was fifteen .
VALERY: You have no forced tattoos ?
NIKOLAI: None .
GYPSY: You were not co-operative ?
NIKOLAI: I spent two years in the punishment lock .
VALERY: You went through the Crosses in St. Petersburg ?
NIKOLAI: I was in solitary confinement fifteen times . I was called 'The Stump ' because they could n't shift me .
VALERY: Your father was a bitch and a weak fucker for working with the Government , that 's right is n't it ? Nikolai flickers a little .
NIKOLAI: That 's right . My father means nothing to me . My Mother .
GYPSY: You have no mother . She was a whore anyway .
NIKOLAI: Yes . I have no mother and no father . There is only the code , the vory v zakone code which I have always followed .
VALERY: That is why there is an empty place above your heart . Where the stars will go . And why there is an empty place on your knees .
NIKOLAI: I am dead already . I died when I was fifteen . Now I live in the zone all the time .
GYPSY: You have never worked for the government ? Any government ?
NIKOLAI: I have lived off Albanians and Georgians . I steal from them within the law .
HELEN: Have you slept at all ?
ANNA: I do n't think the driver would do anything to Stepan .
HELEN: How do you know what he would do ? A pause .
OZIM: Semyon recommends these places fo usiness meetings because you can see what tattoos a man has .
NIKOLAI: How come ?
OZIM: The Americans . Fucking NATO . Valery Nabokov imports flowers and television sets into this country . The television sets are one in ten . That means one in ten have cargo inside them .
NIKOLAI: Where do they dock ? Ozim grins .
OZIM: I will tell you when I return from the bathroom .
OZIM: Kirill is in there .
NIKOLAI: Ozim ?
ANNA: I 'm so late . Sorry . She looks around the 'party ' with horror
AZIZ: It 's fine , although I think I 've had enough .
ANNA: Paul , on my way here I made a decision .
AZIZ: You ca n't possibly dump me . We 're not even going out .
ANNA: Take my hand . Aziz , confused , takes her hand .
AZIZ: Yes , I can .
NURSE: Anna ?
ANNA: Is it OK to talk to him for a minute ? The nurse hesitates
NURSE: He 's still in trauma . Do you know him ?
ANNA: Yes .
NIKOLAI: I thought you did birth .
ANNA: My uncle . Nikolai tries to sit up and registers pain .
NIKOLAI: Yes . A pause .
ANNA: Edinburgh ?
NIKOLAI: I 'm going to need some clothes . I arrived here without any . Can you get me some ? Anna does n't budge .
ANNA: You ca n't walk out of here because you 're attached to a drip . Explain Edinburgh .
NIKOLAI: Your uncle knew too much . Nikolai shrugs .
ANNA: no , I could n't get much sense out of him , he was drunk . A pause . Anna looks exasperated .
NIKOLAI: You got my message ? Yuri chuckles .
YURI: Using a dead body to file a progress eport must be against FSB egulations .
NIKOLAI: It 's called improvisation .
YURI: You 've been improvising quite a lot lately . And taking risks . He glances at the cuts on Nikolai 's hands
NIKOLAI: You did n't come here to give me flowers
YURI: In light of what has happened to you Nikolai shakes his head wearily .
NIKOLAI: Ah , Christ
YURI: and in light of other violent incidents associated with you , the Russian desk at Scotland Yard have made an official request to the Russian embassy that your undercove operation in London be terminated . Nikolai does n't react for a moment .
NIKOLAI: If they terminate the operation now , they will be wasting this
YURI: They are bound to ask who did you kill ? A pause .
NIKOLAI: Tell them I only killed myself .
YURI: What drugs are they giving you ? Maybe it 's the anesthetic speaking .
NIKOLAI: I need you to take Semyon out of the picture . I want you to arrest him .
YURI: Arrest him for what ?
NIKOLAI: Rape . Yuri begins to chuckle .
YURI: And of course , she will testify
NIKOLAI: She does n't have to . She 's dead . A pause .
YURI: You intrigue me . A pause .
NIKOLAI: How is Uncle Stepan ?
ANNA: They 're from the morgue . They elonged to someone who died yesterday .
NIKOLAI: Hey wait a minute
ANNA: Yeah . It 's OK .
NIKOLAI: Did you get in touch with Tatiana 's family in Russia ?
ANNA: No .
NIKOLAI: Good .
ANNA: She 's staying here for good . They peer at each other .
NIKOLAI: Yeah , and all the thanks I get is a pair of dead man 's shoes .

MARIA: It sounded like something .
KIRILL: Someone I know got hurt and I blamed Grandpa .
MARIA: Did you fight each other ? I heard anging .
KIRILL: No . It 's not a fight if one of you does n't fight back .
SEMYON: You 'll have a drink , Yuri He is half on his feet .

YURI: We just need a blood sample .
SEMYON: For what ?
YURI: We can take the sample right now voluntarily or I can get an orde from the court . It 's up to you . Semyon glances at the doctor and chuckles .
SEMYON: He sits there like a vampire .
YURI: What , you are afraid of needles , Semyon ? Semyon 's face hardens and he glares at Yuri .
SEMYON: I am afraid of conspiracies . A pause . Yuri speaks softly .
YURI: I will return tomorrow with a court order . He gets to his feet .
SEMYON: Wait . I 've done nothing wrong .
KIRILL: What did they want with you , papa ?
SEMYON: To poison me .
KIRILL: Why would they want your blood , papa ?
SEMYON: I do n't know .
KIRILL: Maybe it 's about the baby .
SEMYON: What baby ? A pause .
KIRILL: Some bitch was out there saying you were the father of a baby . Semyon turns to Kirill , his face hardening
SEMYON: What are you talking about ? Semyon approaches and Kirill gets scared .
KIRILL: It was nothing . Just some bitch
SEMYON: Who ?
KIRILL: The woman from the hospital . The midwife .
ANNA: Sonya ! Is someone bathing Christine ?
SONYA: No . She 's in her cot .

KIRILL: I swear I did n't know my dad was setting you up .
NIKOLAI: He 's going away . When he 's gone the family business will be yours . A pause .

Let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story . This is my side , the right one . Like , totally .
RHIANNON: Fuck off ! George is not a ` sexy ' name . George is like what you name your teddy bear , not the name you wan na scream out during an orgasm .
OLIVE: That 's bullshit . There are lots of sexy Georges .
RHIANNON: Name three .
OLIVE: Should n't that alone be enough ?
RHIANNON: Fine . That 's one . Number two ?
OLIVE: Okay . George Ummmm Reeves !
RHIANNON: Who 's that ?
OLIVE: Superman . From way back . He was hot .
RHIANNON: No way . Teddy bear .
OLIVE: Bullshit . Ben Affleck played him in that movie !
RHIANNON: So what ? Charlize Theron played that butt-fucking-ugly lesbo serial killer . Besides he 's from anothe century .
MORE: 3 .
OLIVE: George Stephanopolous .
RHIANNON: What are you ? Fifty ?
OLIVE: George
RHIANNON: Bush ? Yeah . He 's one hot mutherfucker . Just face it . There 's no such thing as a sexy George .
OLIVE: Well , mine is . So , I think we should just put this conversation to bed .
RHIANNON: Fine . Do n't come . I hate you . Rhiannon folds her arms and pouts .
OLIVE: Let me back up . I do n't know if any of you have ever met them , but Rhiannon 's parents are quite possibly the creepiest people in a four county radius .
RHIANNON: PLEASE . Please . I 'm begging you . I 'll pay you .
OLIVE: Rhi , I ca n't . I told you I have plans .
RHIANNON: You 're lying . You 're a lying bitch and I hate you so much right now .
OLIVE: I 'm not lying . I promise I 'm not . I really would love to go camping with your family this weekend . I had fun with your family last year .
MR. ABERNATHY: Would you like a marshmallow , Olive Oil ?
MRS. ABERNATHY: Olive oil . That 's funny . Very , very funny .
OLIVE: No thank you , Mr. Abernathy .
MR. ABERNATHY: You can call me Mortimer , Olive Branch .
RHIANNON: Why do n't you just say it ? You do n't like my parents . You think they 're hopelessly pathetic and devoid of souls and wish that you could live with normal people who did n't meet at a Star Trek convention ! !
OLIVE: ( Sympathetic to he
FRIEND: Rhi , I like your parents . They 're sweet . But I ca n't go camping this weekend .
RHIANNON: Quick . Hurry and make up a lie .
OLIVE: I have a date .
RHIANNON: Liar .
OLIVE: No . I do .
RHIANNON: With who ?
OLIVE: You do n't know him .
RHIANNON: And neither do you , you selfish itch !
OLIVE: I 'm serious . He goes to the community college with my brothe in Denton .
RHIANNON: What 's his name then ?
OLIVE: Who ? My brother ?
RHIANNON: Stop stalling . You 're totally trying to come up with a name . Just say it .
OLIVE: I 'm not proud of this . Less about the lie and more about the unoriginality of it . Okay , have you guys ever watched ` The Brady Bunch ' ? Of course you have n't . You 're busy watching fake people pretend to be real on MTV . That 's why I knew I could get away with it . See , there was this episode where Jan - the awkward middle child - made up a boyfriend to assuage the ridicule of her snatchy sister who had just stolen the heart of the boy that Jan loved . The name of her imaginary boyfriend
WAS: 7 .
OLIVE: George Glass .
RHIANNON: George ? What kind of a fucking name is George ?
OLIVE: He 's pretty hot and he asked me out this weekend , so I said yes .
RHIANNON: If you 're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even I 'm not convinced are n't serial killers , he had better be the one . You had better fucking marry him , have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything he 's worth .
OLIVE: Deal .
RHIANNON: You 're not off the hook , you know . I want lurid details . This had etter be the best date of you life to counterbalance the worst weekend of mine .
OLIVE: I 'm sure you 'll have a good time .
CLENCHED TEETH: Even though we now hate each other , Rhi , I really hope you 're watching this . Because this part 's for you . The lurid details of my weekend en flagrante delicto with the all-too- imaginary , yet surprisingly satisfying George Glass
THINKS: about it 's olive drab drab .
DOESN'T KNOW: that it is about to be named ` Color of the Year , ' y those with the nose for the new . By the passionate few . Yeah reads TEEN PEOPLE magazine .
EVERYTHING: that can possibly mean
MORE: 9 .
OLIVE WHATNOTS: and olive trees ! Olive trees ? What a quaint notion Olive trees .
CHUCKLING: Olive .
OLIVE: But on Monday , when Rhi asked me how my weekend was
RHIANNON: Details , bitch . Wait , first I need a scope of reference . Who would play him in the movie of your life ?
OLIVE: Ryan Gosling , definitely .
RHIANNON: That works . Spill .
OLIVE: He was charming . A real gentleman .
RHIANNON: Are you going to see him again ?
OLIVE: Probably not . It was just one of those weekends .
RHIANNON: The whole weekend ?
OLIVE: Yeah .
RHIANNON: Wait a minute . You did n't
OLIVE: No , of course not .
RHIANNON: You fucking liar ! You totally lost your virginity to him .
OLIVE: I did not .
RHIANNON: YES YOU DID , YOU LYING FUCKING WHORE !
MORE: 11 .
OLIVE: I 'm not that kind of girl .
RHIANNON: The kind that does it or the kind that does it like a fucking porn star and then does n't have the alls to talk about it ? Rhi drags her into the
OLIVE: Okay . Fine . We did it .
RHIANNON: You lost your virginity ! Fucking finally ! Now , you 're a super-slut like me !
OLIVE: Rhi . Blowing Peter Tolliver once ehind the Pizza Hut does n't make you a super-slut .
RHIANNON: There were people walking past . Whatever , this is n't about me . This is about YOU . What did you let him do ?
OLIVE: No . It was great . Like I said . Okay , that 's enough .
RHIANNON: What the fuck are you looking at , Marianne ?
MARIANNE: Nothing . Just a couple of admitted whores .
OLIVE: So , how was your weekend ?
MR. ABERNATHY: Wienie , Rhi ?
OLIVE: Marianne Bryant , as we all know , is the President of the Christian Student Coalition and is that rare eed of human born with a stick the size of a baseball bat implanted up her anus . God 's honest . I 'm sure it 's in some medical dictionary somewhere .
MASCOT: Blue Devils ! Blue Devils ! Blue Devils ! The crowd goes wild .
MARIANNE: How can we exhibit school pride when we 're conveyed to others as satan worshippers ?
MASCOT: Go meerkats ! Go meerkats !
RHIANNON: What the fuck is a meerkat anyway ?
OLIVE: Beats the hell out of me . But can we just take a moment to applaud the Barbara Bush High School Marching Band for their very ambitious effort to learn all of the James Bond theme music in a single year ? I personally wish them all the best in thei endeavor . Ku-dos !
RHIANNON: I think I speak for all of the female students and faculty - and maybe a couple of males - when I say that I liked Todd much bette when he was shirtless . I actually looked forward to these disturbing displays of what do they call it ?
OLIVE: School spirit .
RHIANNON: Yeah . That 's it .
OLIVE: Even dressed as a meerkat , I still fantasize about him .
RHIANNON: Ha ! What are those people called again ? The ones that dress up like stuffed animals when they do it ?
OLIVE: Communists . Rhiannon laughs .
RHIANNON: Shhh . Do n't let Marianne hear you say that word . The last thing we need is McCarthyism at Barbara Bush .
OLIVE: Is n't high school already a hotbed of just that ?
RHIANNON: True . Yeah , I 'd totally fuck Meerkat Todd . They both get lost in the thought .
OLIVE: So , of course , immediately I knew that the little white lie I told to my then-best-friend in the ladies oom would come back to bite me on the ass . However , even I - who my fourth grade teacher stated on my eport card ` has an imagination that should be quickly expunged ' - had no idea how quickly this article of fiction would spread . So , now we move on to Part Two The Accelerated Velocity of Terminological Inexactitude .
MARIANNE: What ?
OLIVE: Listen , what you heard in the athroom , that was n't true . It 's actually a funny story . Do you ever watch ` The Brady Bunch ' ?
MARIANNE: Olive - that 's your name , right ?
OLIVE: Who ? The guidance counselor ?
MARIANNE: I hope for your sake , God has a sense of humor .
OLIVE: Oh , I have sixteen years worth of anecdotal proof that He does .
SOTTO VOCE: Damn it .
MARIANNE: Look . You 've made your bed . I just hope for your sake , you cleaned the sheets .
OLIVE: Did I just get saved ?
SLIGHTLY CONCERNED: What 's up , sweet pea ?
OLIVE: It 's nothing . Just the rumor mill .
ROSEMARY: What 's the rumor mill turning out these days ?
OLIVE: Seriously , it 's nothing . They continue to eat .
ROSEMARY: Do n't forget your brother 's staying here next weekend .
OLIVE: Why ? He never comes home .
ROSEMARY: They 're fumigating the dorms . And thank God for that . Last time I was there , I saw three cockroaches .
GINGER: Mom , can you please not say that word while I 'm eating ?
ROSEMARY: Sorry , hon .
OLIVE: Like all families , mine has a deep dark secret . And since I 'm spilling all this dirt , I might as well go ahead and confess it . She takes a deep breath .
FEIGNING DISCOMFORT: edible items . My brother 's name is Sage and my sister 's name is Ginger . It 's shocking , I know . We 're like a fucking pantry , us Penderghasts !
SNAPPING BACK: But at least my parents did n't meet at a ` Star Trek ' convention , BITCH ! Sorry . Now , I 'm just being mean . Okay . Back to the story .
OLIVE: If I 'd known that Meerkat Todd was going to turn out so hot , I probably would have cherished the moment more . I suppose just that I 'm sitting here reminiscing about it means that it must have meant something . Yeah , so anyway - kissing 's not eally my thing . That 's what I learned in Natalie Giblin 's closet . I digress
MR. GRIFFIN: Alright , so thoughts ?
NINA: I think Hester Prynne was - excuse my language - a whore .
MR. GRIFFIN: You do n't see her as a victim ?
NINA: Why should I ? She brought it on herself .
OLIVE: Excuse me ?
NINA: Perhaps you should embroider a red A on your wardrobe ?
OLIVE: Perhaps you should GET a wardrobe , you twat !
MARIANNE: Seems as if someone 's on a downward spiral .
OLIVE: Seems as if someone 's practicing the mundane activities she 'll be saddled with the rest of he pathetic life .
MARIANNE: You have a chip on your shoulde the size of Texas .
OLIVE: Wow , that 's even bigger than you ass .
MARIANNE: You 're going to hell .
OLIVE: ( Growing weary of this
BANTER: As long as you wo n't be there
MARIANNE: Oh , I can assure you I wo n't . Neither says anything for a few moments .
OLIVE: Why ? Your parents did n't .
MARIANNE: You know , you 're just like
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: I do n't know you . She thrusts her hand out .
OLIVE: Olive Penderghast .
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: Why are we just now meeting ? Using language like this should have warranted a visit to me years ago .
OLIVE: Well , to be perfectly honest - I 've never used an epithet like this in an educational arena before . Sir .
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: This is foul .
OLIVE: In my defense , I think I meant to say ` twit . ' It just came out more - what 's the word I 'm looking for ? Veracious .
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: A young lady with such an extensive vocabulary should n't be stooping to such vituperations .
OLIVE: Touché . As serious as a heart attack
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: Wipe that smile off your face Olive . I do n't tolerate this kind of language . Ever . Consider this your first warning . If I find out you 've used a word like this in my school again , I will make sure that it 's your last . I do n't operate on a ` three strikes you 're out system ' . You get one warning from me . She starts to say something
OLIVE: I always do . Are we finished ? He gestures to the door .
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS: Detention tomorrow after school in Room 704 . And , young lady , I do n't want to see you again .
OLIVE: Not even in a more positive capacity ? Maybe I could win a ibbon or a medal or something . I could conceivably be valedictorian . Or something .
FRIGHTENINGLY SERIOUS: Get out of my office now . She quickly runs out of his office .
RHIANNON: Please tell me the rumors are true .
OLIVE: Yes , I 'm a big whore .
RHIANNON: Not that one . The one where you called Nina Howell a cunt and then socked her in the nose .
OLIVE: It 's not entirely true . Look , there 's something I need to tell you .
RHIANNON: Yeah . Like the exact moment you turned into such a BAD ASS ? I think I 'm in LOVE with you .
MORE: 28 .
OLIVE: Never mind .
RHIANNON: Please . It 's my only perk . Trust me . They get into her car .
OLIVE: I got sent to the Principal today .
DILL: What did you do ?
OLIVE: I used inappropriate language in English class . But we 're reading a ook that I , personally , deem wildly inappropriate for my age group , so I felt that it was actually quite apropos .
ROSEMARY: What did you say ?
OLIVE: Let 's just say it was an inappropriate word .
DILL: What did it start with ?
OLIVE: A snide comment from a snotty-ass girl in my class .
DILL: I meant what letter did it start with ?
OLIVE: Oh . Yeah . T .
ROSEMARY: T ? That 's an odd one . Is this one of those new curse words ?
OLIVE: I do n't even know what that means .
ROSEMARY: Yeah . Neither do I .
DILL: Okay . Noun , adjective or verb ?
OLIVE: Noun . Definitely slang . Think British , although they pronounce it differently .
ROSEMARY: Well , I 'm stumped . Whisper it in my ear .
OLIVE: I ca n't . Too weird . Excited by the prospect
ROSEMARY: Oo ! Oo ! Spell it with your peas !
OLIVE: Now , THAT 'S a challenge .
DILL: Does this have something to do with this rumor you were talking about the other night ?
OLIVE: I 'm spelling it out for you as quickly as I can .
GINGER: I got a B plus on my spelling test today .
ROSEMARY: Good , sweetheart .
GINGER: ( Glancing at Olive 's
PLATE: What 's a twat ? Olive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile .
DILL: It 's a word that will get you sent to the principal 's office .
ROSEMARY: ( Whispering into Ginger 's
EAR: It 's not a good word .
MORE: 31 .
TO OLIVE: So , what was the principal like ?
OLIVE: The male equivalent .
ROSEMARY: Of what ?
DILL: Well , it 's the first time since second grade , so I guess we ca n't e too hard on you .
GENUINELY CURIOUS: What would my punishment have been otherwise ?
DILL: I dunno . To bed without supper ?
OLIVE: But I 'm already finished . Except for my helpful and profane peas .
DILL: Uhhhh . This grounding thing seems to be taking the country by storm . No phone , TV or Or .
OLIVE: I 'll help you out . I do n't have anyone to call . I have n't watched TV since they cancelled ` The Illegitimate Children of the Real Housewives of Laguna Beach ' and I eally only watched that as a joke .
DILL: Fine . I 'd take away your
OLIVE: Books ? Computer ?
DILL: Yes ! You 're computer !
OLIVE: All my homework 's on there . Sorry . You lose . But thanks for playing .
DILL: I guess then I 'm lucky this is n't a egular occurrence .
OLIVE: I think we both are . I would n't know how to be grounded any more than you know how to ground .
DILL: I love you . And I 'm sure that girl was acting like exactly what you called her .
WHISPERING BACK: You have no idea .
GINGER: How come you guys never get mad at her ?
ROSEMARY: Because , pumpkin , of our three darling children , we love her best . Just kidding ! Now eat your dinner . Dill chuckles , but Ginger is not amused .
OLIVE: The next day , things took a turn for the scandalous . Which brings us to Part Three A Lady 's Choice and a Gentleman 's Agreement . She smiles slyly into her camera .
BULLIED KID: I do n't think we pose a flight isk .
OLIVE: I see . Olive laughs to herself .
BULLIED KID: What ?
OLIVE: I was just thinking it 's kind of funny . We have n't really talked since that closet incident back in eighth grade .
BULLIED KID: I was afraid you were going to ing that up .
OLIVE: So , how have you been , Brandon ?
BRANDON: I have been fantastic .
MORE: 34 .
OLIVE: Yikes .
BRANDON: Yeah , only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing ` turd burglar ' off . Which , if you think about it , eally contradicts the previous label .
OLIVE: Maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility ? Brandon shoots her a ` that 's not funny ' look .
BRANDON: But , of course , I 'm in detention .
OLIVE: Why ?
BRANDON: Because Gibbons is a homophobe . And I called him a facist .
OLIVE: So , the rumors are true , huh ?
BRANDON: Have you ever met me ?
OLIVE: No . I meant about Gibbons being a facist . He laughs .
BRANDON: Gold star for you , Nancy Drew . There 's a brief silence between them .
OLIVE: You know , I read this article that said with this whole EMO movement , it looks like - that in a few years - the gay kids are going to be the most popular ones in school .
BRANDON: Oh good . I 'll come back when I 'm twenty seven for my redo . Ignoring his cynicism
OLIVE: Can you imagine the dance squad full of shirtless guys in tight pants rocking out to Britney , while the football players sit on the sidelines wishing they were that cool ?
BRANDON: That 'll be the day . Judging from the new look you 're sporting , I 'm not the only one in a transformative stage . ` Sup with the whore couture ?
OLIVE: Have n't you heard ? I 'm the new school slut !
BRANDON: As a matter of fact I did hea that . I heard you banged a guy twice your age .
OLIVE: No way . He 's a freshman in college .
BRANDON: Also heard he gave you crabs .
OLIVE: Ewwww . People suck .
BRANDON: Tell me about it .
OLIVE: He 's not real . The guy I slept with . I made him up .
BRANDON: So , you started the rumor ?
OLIVE: Indirectly ? Sort of . Well , not eally . No . No , I did n't .
BRANDON: But you 're perpetuating it . That 's fucked up .
OLIVE: Excuse me ?
BRANDON: It 's true . There 's only one thing worse than these tabloid-chasing celebutantes with their vapid minds and their immoral souls and that 's the people who want to be like them .
OLIVE: Did I say I wanted to be like them ?
BRANDON: No , you just want everyone else to think you are .
OLIVE: Why does it matter if it 's not who I really am ? No offense , Brando , ut maybe you could learn something from me .
BRANDON: You 're saying I should pretend to e straight , so people will like me ? What a novel idea . You should do seminars . Oh , wait a minute , I forgot In high school ,
OLIVE: Calm down , Adolph . There 's a vein popping out of your neck . I 'm simply suggesting that maybe these kids we call peers have got the ight idea . Maybe Bridget Schumacher is n't as hippy-dippy as she pretends to be . Maybe that 's just the label she 's put on herself to avoid having to bathe as often as society deems necessary . O take Marianne Bryant . It 's convenient for her to act like a stuck-up Jesus-freak . No . I 'm wrong . I think she 's actually just a stuck-up Jesus- freak . But do you think she cares that that 's the way she 's perceived ? No . Maybe she was just sick of being just anothe nameless , faceless entity in a place and a time that reveres people for extremity ?
BRANDON: There are some of us , though , that want to just blend in to the crowd .
OLIVE: Then maybe you need to go to that extreme . Or make the steadfast decision not to care . Even bette if you can manage to do both . I 've discovered an infallible emedy for teen angst apathy .
BRANDON: I ca n't decide if you 're a genius or a lunatic .
OLIVE: Do n't they sort of go hand-in-hand ? She smiles sinisterly at him .
BRANDON: Funny . I always thought teen angst and apathy went hand in hand .
OLIVE: How am I doing ?
BRANDON: What ? Pretending to be a whore ? For a virgin , I 'm impressed . How about me ? Could I pass as straight ?
OLIVE: Not bad . For a fag .
BRANDON: I prefer the term ` turd burglar . '
OLIVE: If we really wanted to shock the world , we 'd get up and leave detention .
BRANDON: But you know that we would never do that .
OLIVE: Is n't going to stop me from telling everybody we did .
BRANDON: It 's Brandon .
OLIVE: Speak of the devil
BRANDON: Hi . Is there an Olive here ?
FEIGNING CONFUSION: There 's a whole jar of them in the fridge .
BRANDON: Sorry , I must have gotten the address wrong .
ROSEMARY: Just kidding ! Come on in . Brandon walks in and Rosemary shouts
OLIVE: Oh happy day , Mama ! I thought I was going to have to spend my dowry on ooze and pills to numb the loneliness .
BRANDON: Do you wan na go out with me ? She looks at him , strangely .
OLIVE: Brandon , just a few hours ago , you told me you were Kinsey Six gay .
BRANDON: True . But you said I should pretend to be straight .
OLIVE: Well , I did n't mean with me . You 're a sweet guy and all , but you 're not really my type .
BRANDON: You 're not really my type either .
OLIVE: I should say not .
BRANDON: Okay . Well , do you wan na have sex with me ?
OLIVE: You 're serious . He nervously nods .
BRANDON: No , I know what you were saying . I should play it straight until I get out of this hell and then I can be whoever I want to be . No , I got that .
OLIVE: Brandon , I did n't REALLY have sex with a college guy . I just told people I did .
MORE: 43 .
CONSIDERS THIS: Well , actually , I just told one person and - well - you know how these things work .
BRANDON: So , you 're saying I should n't eally have sex . I should just say I had sex with someone . A girl .
OLIVE: Now , you 're cooking with gas .
BRANDON: Think about it . We could help each other out . You want to maintain this floozy facade . I want to not get my face pummelled weekly .
OLIVE: You are on crack .
BRANDON: All it would take is one good imaginary fuck and you 'd be saving the bone structure of my face . Think of how happy my parents would e !
OLIVE: This is not the answer . Why do n't you just do what I did and make someone up ?
BRANDON: Who would believe me ?
GROWING INCREASINGLY: DESPERATE ) Listen , Olive , I do n't want to do this . I want to live in that not- too-distant EMO world , but I still have another year of this bullshit place and I ca n't do it . I just ca n't do it .
MORE: 44 .
OLIVE: I just do n't think it would work .
BRANDON: Whores are n't discerning , Olive . And just think - you 'll OFFICIALLY e a hooker with a heart of gold !
OLIVE: I do n't want your money .
BRANDON: I insist .
OLIVE: So , if I say yes , you 're going to tell a couple of people at school and I just have to go with it ? I eally do n't think it will work .
BRANDON: ( His voice cracking with
EMOTION: I can make it work . I promise . She sees tears forming in his eyes .
OLIVE: I do n't do anything half-assed . ( Spinning around to face
HIM: It 'll have to be a public event . Melanie Bostic is having a party tomorrow night . All of you tormentors will be there . You and I are going together . You have to do everything I say AND you have to tell people that I was sensational .
BRANDON: I ca n't believe you 're doing this .
OLIVE: Afterwards , it 's up to you . You 're committing to something .
MORE: 45 .
OLIVE: I 'm sure you all remember the party
MELANIE: Hey Olive !
WEIRDED OUT: Hi Brandon .
OLIVE: OhmiGod , Melly . I hope you do n't mind , but we had a few pre-cocktail party cocktails
DISORIENTED: Party . Cocktails .
MELANIE: Well , glad you could make it .
OLIVE: Soooo , here 's the thing .
MORE: 46 .
HICCUP: About his thing ? That 's funny ?
MELANIE: Sure . You can use the guest room . Down the hall .
OLIVE: I love you . I love you so much . You are Just , yeah .
MELANIE: ( Shocked ; Mouthing to a
GUEST: What the fuck ? !
BULLY: Was that Olive with Brandon ?
MELANIE: I know ! Right ?
OLIVE: Draw the shades .
BRANDON: How long do we have to do this ?
OLIVE: Depends . Do you wan na be a normal adolescent boy or do you wan na be a stud ?
WHISPERING: Now that I think about it , we probably do n't want to do this fo too long . It 'll give the impression that you 're having difficulty finishing . That 's not the desired effect .
BRANDON: Are you sure you 're a virgin ?
WHISPERING STERNLY: Of course I am !
LOUDLY: Oh , fuck me ! Fuck me ! Do n't stop fucking me ! Brandon suppresses a laugh .
OLIVE: Hold on .
BRANDON: Thanks Olive . He kisses her on the cheek and she smiles .
OLIVE: Is there a ?
MELANIE: Back entrance is through the kitchen .
OLIVE: Thanks .
MEERKAT TODD: Sorry .
OLIVE: Hi Todd .
MEERKAT TODD: How 's it going ?
OLIVE: I 'M ( She does n't know how she
IS: I 'm here .
MEERKAT TODD: Can I get you a beer ?
OLIVE: That rhymed .
MELODRAMATICALLY: REENACTING ) ` You ! Even Bobby thinks we went out . Great , huh ? Ha ! All of you thought we were a couple . What a joke ! Ronald Miller paid me 1,000 bucks to pretend I liked him . What a deal , huh ? $ 1,000 to go out with him for a month . This guy . Oh , God . He bought me . And he bought all of you . He was sick and tired of being a nobody . Yeah , and he said that all of you guys would worship him if we went out . And I did n't believe that . I was , like , no way ! And he was right ! No , leave me alone . He was right . Our little plan worked , did n't it , Ronald ? The dance . That stupid dance ! What a unch of followers you guys are . I mean , at least I got At least I got paid . ' ` Ca n't Buy Me Love ' is one of the est movies ever made . Hands down . You guys should totally watch it if you have n't already . Or even if you have . Seriously fine filmmaking .
OLIVE: Oh , Cindy Mancini . It could have een a lot worse . Trust me . Her mom comes in with a nicely-wrapped gift .
ROSEMARY: That kid from the other night just dropped this off for you . Indicating an empty space on the floor
OLIVE: Put it on the pile of gifts from my other suitors .
ROSEMARY: He seems like a nice boy Gay
OLIVE: A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual that oy is . Rosemary puts the gift on the floor .
ROSEMARY: I dated a homosexual in high school .
OLIVE: We 're not dating , Mom .
ROSEMARY: I just wanted to tell you that if you want to date a gay boy , it might be hard on your father and I , at first . But we love you no matter what the sexual orientation of your opposite-sex partner . Rosemary leaves , chuckling at her own joke .
EXCITEDLY: Your package was perfection !
OLIVE: Rhi ?
RHIANNON: I have many questions , obviously .
OLIVE: Yes , Virginia , there is a Santa Claus . No , in fact , I do NOT know the way to San Jose . And - little known fact - contrary to popula elief , panama hats are not from Panama at all ! They 're from Ecuador ! Who knew ?
RHIANNON: Now is not the time to be cute .
OLIVE: You 're putting me in a precarious position , because ( With her best Jackie-O
VOICE: ` according to last month 's Cosmopolitan Magazine , we should always look cute . Even when we 're doing mundane activities such as choosing vegetables from the produce section of our local grocery store . '
RHIANNON: Olive , stop it . This is serious . Did you really bang Brandon last night at Melanie Dipshit 's party ? Olive sighs as she slumps into her pillows .
OLIVE: Is that what people are saying happened ?
RHIANNON: That 's what EVERYONE is saying .
OLIVE: Then I guess it 's true .
RHIANNON: Does this mean you guys are dating ?
OLIVE: God no .
RHIANNON: Just because you lost you virginity does n't mean you can go around screwing everybody !
OLIVE: Uh , thanks Mom . Good talk .
RHIANNON: You 're getting a reputation .
OLIVE: Y'know , you 're really coming off as a little pious right now and you 're kind of pissing me off .
RHIANNON: Please forgive my rectitude , but I think that a best friend 's duty is to let her know that everyone - and I do mean everyone - is calling he a cum dumpster .
OLIVE: Well , do YOU think I 'm a cum dumpster ?
RHIANNON: Look , baby , I call a spade a spade . Entering the red zone
OLIVE: First off , that 's racist . Secondly , fuck you ! How dare you ? I was Laura Ingalls to your Lady Chatterly and , now all of a sudden , YOU feel the need to warn ME that I 'M making a fool of myself ? There are a lot of children who will never again experience Family Pizza Night because of you . So , why do n't you jump off your high horse and splash around in the gutte where you belong .
RHIANNON: I did n't want to believe it , but I guess it 's true . You 're a fucktart .
OLIVE: And you 're a jealous virgin .
RHIANNON: Oh yeah . I totally want to lose my virginity to one of your brother 's friends and then e the first for a fairy , while everyone listens outside ! What is wrong with you ? Does sex mean anything to you ?

OLIVE: Well , rest assured , it was equally as thrilling for me .
EVAN: No , he told me the truth . She 's pissed . She silently seethes .
OLIVE: Walk away , Evan .

EVAN: That 's the problem .
OLIVE: I want five hundred dollars in gift certificate form deposited in my locker before noon tomorrow . Preferably ` The Gap , ' but I 'll also take Amazon.com . We did NOT have sex . I was piss-ass drunk and I let you fondle my chest and it was a glorious moment for you , unmatched by anything you 've heretofore experienced , including cake . Got it ?

OLIVE: It 's fraw-TAHZH , dumbass .
BUCKLING: Fine . But it was so good , you lasted only twelve seconds and I etter not find out that little pecker of yours EVER came out of your pants . Take it or leave it .
EVAN: Little pecker ? Nuh-uh . For five hundred dollars , it was ungodly huge . You even commented on the unusual girth for a guy my age .
OLIVE: I was too drunk to remember .
EVAN: Three minutes .
OLIVE: Two . He extends his hand .
EVAN: Deal .
OLIVE: The sad thing is , Evan , if you had een a gentleman and asked me out on a date , I probably would have said yes .
EVAN: Really ? Do you want to go on a date ? With zero vitriol

OLIVE: Your husband .
MRS. GRIFFIN: Olive , you 're attempting to make a statement . We get that . I 'm just confused as to what exactly it is .
OLIVE: Am I in trouble ? I promise the hem of my dress is n't higher than my fingertips .
MRS. GRIFFIN: You 're not in trouble , Olive . I just wanted you to know that if there was something you maybe needed to talk about , that you could trust me .
OLIVE: If I open up to you , do you promise this stays in confidence ?
MRS. GRIFFIN: Yes .

MRS. GRIFFIN: Or you could always get pregnant ?
OLIVE: I 'm probably closer than either of us thinks
MRS. GRIFFIN: Please do n't tell anyone I gave you these . The school board is

MRS. GRIFFIN: What ? ! What do you want ?
OLIVE: The funny thing is the whole time this shit was going down - people calling me something I knew was n't true , my best friend included - I could n't help but think how I could have come up with better signs . No one even bothered to use alliteration or , God forbid , irony - not even a single acronym - and that seems a lot more unforgivable than my sins .

ANSON: Hey Olive . Olive smiles sweetly at him .
OLIVE: What did you have in mind ?
ANSON: I dunno . I was thinking about chartering a hot air balloon , taking along a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit and then trying to impress you with an overzealous eading of Emily Dickinson .
OLIVE: Why , Anson , are you inviting me to accompany you to a romantic dinne at the Red Lobster ?
ANSON: Unequivocally .
OLIVE: Nice . Yeah . I 'll have dinner with you . Olive walks off
ANSON: Yeah . What 's better than getting to select your dinner and have nice conversation while they boil it alive in the back ?

ANSON: Not at all . I 'm actually kind of honored .
OLIVE: Do you believe this whole thing about lobster being an aphrodisiac ?

OLIVE: Y'know , medical science has not substantiated claims that any particular food increases sexual desire or performance . It 's so funny when guys ply women with food that they think is gon na get them laid . I mean , what 's really sexy about slurping back oysters ? You know , native people believed that you gained the strength of the animal by consuming it . Some people grind up rhinoceros horn , ecause it 's thought to stiffen the male sex organ . It 's all bullshit . And spanish fly ? It 's pulverized eetle that people eat ! Although , it 's illegal for human consumption in the United States and do you know why ? Because if you take just a bit too much , it causes painful urination , fever and bloody discharge .

ANSON: Exactly . I have no interest in her . I mean , we 're friends , but

ANSON: Do you want me to get the check ?
OLIVE: Would you mind ? He gestures for the server who appears .
ANSON: Could we get our check ?

OLIVE: No . Not tonight . I do n't want you to kiss me when mascara 's running down my cheek or some shithead has forced his tongue down my throat only a half-hour ago . I 've wanted to kiss you since the eighth grade , ut I want it to be perfect . And ight now , my life 's a mess . I need to get it under control before I drag you into it .

ROSEMARY: Yep . Don Bryant and I got caught in a very compromising position in the locker room during a basketball game .
OLIVE: That 's disgusting ! He 's disgusting !
ROSEMARY: He was n't back then . He was actually pretty handsome . All I 'm saying is that MAYBE the reason that Bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told he about me .
OLIVE: So , the sins of the mother are evisited on the daughter .
ROSEMARY: There 's something else you should know . This is hard to say but Don Bryant is your father . Marianne is your sister .
OLIVE: I hate you so much right now . Ca n't you see I 'm a mess !
ROSEMARY: No , you 're not , Olive . You 're wonderful . And you 're going to handle this the same way that I did . With an incontrovertible sense of humor . They embrace and Olive gets an idea .

AL: Norman Rockwell . He painted magazine covers . Folksy . A mailman , a boy scout , a kid visiting a doctor
ED: Yeah , so ?
AL: They celebrated the common person .
ED: Well , I do n't think you can get more common than me , Al .
AL: No . Only celebrities now . Now , if you put a mailman on the cove of a magazine he 'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it . This one to Dr. Rumpley . Jeanette storms back in .
JEANETTE: All right do you want to know the truth ? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister 's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox . So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in ou ed . Okay ?
ED: Chicken pox ? I was six . He did n't leave 'til I was twelve .
JEANETTE: He apologized , he begged me . He can be very charming when it suits his purpose .
ED: But what was that whole story about him and a nurse ?
JEANETTE: She could 've been a nurse .
ED: Could 've been a nurse ?
JEANETTE: She had white shoes .
ED: So does Grandma . So does Shaquille O'Neal . You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse .
JEANETTE: What 's the difference ?
ED: The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it 's another thing . Ed nods .
JEANETTE: He was no good . Do you remembe how he used to scream at me ? You used to cover your ears with dinner rolls .
ED: Wait a minute . I thought you did n't know Al , 'til after Dad left .
JEANETTE: He had a woman in my own bed ! And how dare you call him `` Dad '' in front of Al . This is your father . This is who was there for you when you needed someone .
AL: Jeanette , you 're hurting me .
ED: I 'm not I did n't Al , you know how I feel about you Al breathes loudly .
JEANETTE: And what did he come back now for ?
ED: Who ?
JEANETTE: Hank ! All of a sudden . Because now you 're famous and he can get something from you . I do n't wan you to become a victim like Marcia . Not that you 're a victim , honey . You 're not . Life 's just been a little hard on you , sweetie .
ED: What do you think . I mean about him . Should I just have nothing to do with him ? I mean
AL: Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father ?
ED: No .
AL: Well , now I will . He was a crazy mean , son-of-a-bitch .
ED: Hi it 's me , Ed . It 's been two days , I want to see you No , I wo n't let them follow me , I'11 sneak out No it 's not allowed , ut I 'm going for it I 'm on my way . He takes CLOTHING OUT of the bathroom hamper . until he finds something acceptable .
SHARI: I tried to tell you over the phone my parents went to Atlantic City .
ED: So ?
SHARI: So my little brother 's staying here . I 'm sleeping with Rita .
ED: Oh Je could n't he sleep with Rita ? We'11 all have a good time .
SHARI: I 'm sorry .
ED: Come on , let 's go .

ED: Just just relax . Okay ? We wo n't do anything . We'11 just sit here for a while .
SHARI: Okay .
ED: Come on
SHARI: Are you all right ?
ED: She lied to me . I mean all my life , she 's telling me one story and then it turns out to be a completely different story . Come to me at some point tell me the truth . No . Not in my house . The truth is a stranger . And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are . Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - `` How do they find me '' she says . Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it . I 'm the only one in the family who takes any esponsibility for himself Oh , man Are you all right ?
SHARI: Yeah I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show .

I mean let 's face it , I 'm working in the video store , no one 's coming in saying `` oh , I wish I was that guy . 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes . '' At least for a month I 'm not just a guy with a name tag . I 'm famous . A GUY YELLS from across the street .

ED: Oh my He wrote a book ? ! Ray wrote a book ? ! He never read a ook !
ED: It 's Ed . The door opens REVEALING Ed 's father .
HANK: Ed ! Come in - They enter .
ED: It could be , if you fixed it up . How did you ? I mean how does anyone wind up like this ?
HANK: I was in jail .
ED: The whole time ? Eighteen years ?
HANK: No . Two times .
ED: What
HANK: Check forging .
ED: Oh , man ! So
HANK: The last two years , I 've been a limousine driver , but I do n't see well anymore , so
ED: So you saw me on TV and you said `` Hey , let me jump on this . ''
HANK: I need help . How many times if just one little thing that I needed would 've happened , it would 've changed everything . If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or the tumblers just never clicked fo me .
ED: All right This is my father , I do n't know what the hell he can do , but if anyone out there can help him get him a job - I'11 help you . I'11 mention your business or I do n't know , we'11 figure it out . I got ta go .
HANK: Ed I 'm sorry .

HANK: What
ED: The pirate ship . Hank looks blankly at him .
HANK: Do you still have it ?
ED: No . Ray sat on it . I'11 see you .
MODERATOR: Let 's hear from our guest panelist . You 've expressed some interesting thoughts on this , subject . What do you see as the meaning , if there is any , of Ed TV , John .
JOHN: I feel that Ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing American syndrome . It used to be that someone became famous because they were special . Now people are considered special just fo eing famous . Fame , itself , is now a moral good in this country . It 's its own virtue .
OLD GUY: I was Ed 's Little League coach . He had no coordination . The big game , he struck cut with the ases loaded . Then he cried like a woman . It was sickening .
OLD WOMAN: I was his third grade teacher . I said `` Take him for tests . There 's something wrong with him . '' They did n't listen .
ANOTHER GUY: He used to steal things from my store . At least I think it was him . Yeah , it was probably him .
CAT MAN: Hey , look , I just fell off a table !
ED: Okay , is that funny ? Then he throws the tub out the window .
HONCHO #1: Of more concern than the sag in Ed 's ratings is what viewers are feeling about him now . The positives are down and the negatives are up . There 's a feeling that Ed is n't cool anymore . We 're starting to see a big L.F .
GREG: Hm ?
HONCHO #1: L.F. Loser Factor .
HONCHO #2: That 's deadly . McILVAINE Not necessarily . I mean instead of running from the L.F. , run with it . Create more moments like the table thing . We can package a video `` Ed 's Goofiest Moments . '' Let him be America 's Goofball .
CYNTHIA: Is n't this getting kind of pathetic . I mean we drank the juice , now we 're just licking peel . Let it go !
SCHARLACH: Cynthia , I think you 're laboring under a misconception . You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this , we should be impressed . We 're not . Anybody in any business can predict failure . 1 need people who prevent failure . I want to see this thing turned back in the ight direction . Remember this was your baby .
TAD: I do n't know , I still love this guy .
BARRY: Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more .
TAD: Ooh , the sister ! She is hot .
BARRY: You know it .
JOMA'S FRIEND: Ignore him .
JOMA: I ca n't ! It 's like a mudslide . Put on a shirt !
JOMA'S FRIEND: Shut the curtains .
JOMA: No ! Let him shut the curtains .
ED: This Joma is so phoney ! I mean , those things are n't really happening . I think they have writers making that stuff up fo him . Hey , could n't we do that ? Hire some writers and have them write up some crazy situations I could get into ? She 's listening , amazed .
CYNTHIA: Ed , everything goes off . `` Cheers '' went off . `` Mash '' went off
ED: Yeah , but when they went off people were n't making fun of them . They were n't bozos ! I 'm Pumpkin Ass again !
CYNTHIA: Ed
ED: You know , everything you asked me to do I did . I call you fo advice about Shari you say - `` Leave her be , see other people for a while . '' You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show .
CYNTHIA: Ed
ED: No . You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings . You never gave a shit about me .
CYNTHIA: Yeah ? Well I 'm not starting now . She HANGS UP and has an acid reflux .
JOHN: Look , you put anybody on TV sixteen hours a day , at some point they 're going to wind up olling off a table on to a cat . I mean with no privacy , there 's no dignity . Ed thinks . Pause .
ED: You know about that fireman who escued that little girl ?
JOHN: When ? Today ?
ED: No ! Like , ten years ago . In Texas . Baby Jessica !
JOHN: Oh right , right ! She fell down , like a
ED: Yeah , a thing . He became a big hero . He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
JOHN: Right , right
ED: And then , uh you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again .
JOHN: Right .
ED: So he killed himself .
JOHN: Oh . SILENCE . The cell phone RINGS . Ed PICKS UP the phone .
ED: Hello .

ED: I thought I thought he was dead .
DR. GELLER: Who ?

DR. GELLER: No . The deceased is Henry Pekurny .
TAD: Good twist !
AL: You thought it was me ?
ED: Yes !

ED: What happened ?
JEANETTE: It was horrible . He called me up .
ED: Who ?
JEANETTE: Hank ! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged he cried . So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in I felt so sorry for him
ED: So you had sex with him ? Jeanette GASPS .
JEANETTE: What ?
ED: The doctor said you were having sex .
JEANETTE: To you ? In front of him ? With the
ED: Yes . He assumed Hank was you husband . He did n't know .
JEANETTE: Oh my god ! On TV !
ED: Why ? How
JEANETTE: One thing led to another . He was my husband once .
ED: But Al is your husband now !
JEANETTE: Do you think it 's been easy fo me ? It 's been years . Al ca n't have sex .
ED: Apparently , neither can Hank . What the hell did you do to him ? Al comes rolling back , SINGING .
AL: `` Lovely Rita , the Meter Maid
JEANETTE: Do n't tell Al . He does n't know .
ED: Well , he 's the only one in America who does n't ! OPRAH or RICKI or GERALDO or someone .
OPRAH: Women who remarry but have sex with their first husbands . on today 's Oprah .
PANELIST #3: Ed 's family is the tip of the iceberg . You watch the daytime tabloid shows it 's the same thing . I 'm telling you , America is fast becoming a trailer park .
PANELIST #2: Let 's not overstate the case . There are millions of hard- working , sensible , moral , educated people in this country . Not every family is like Ed 's . REVEAL ED watching this discussion on TV .

RAY: I got paid by the word ! No ! Your problem is you do n't eve want anything to be your fault .
ED: Me ? ! That 's you !
RAY: I commit . I take a chance . You wanted to be the guy on TV , but you did n't want to say you wanted to . So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want , but if it goes bad it 's not you fault .
BYSTANDER #2: Right . Like you say you love Shari , but , you would n't mind noodling that model .
ED: Moe !
BYSTANDER #3: The truth hurts .
ED: Yeah ? So does a kick in the nuts .
RAY: For once in your life , be honest with yourself . I know you , Ed . I know you look at me and Marcia and Mom and you think you 're different . You 're like `` How did I end up in this family ? '' You 're not different . you 're worse . Because you have no guts . You drift around , you do n't commit , you make fun of me okay . Just do n't kid yourself . Let 's go .
JEANETTE: You 're both good boys . Ray and Jeanette leave .
ED: Three more months ?
MR. SCHARLACH: Absolutely ! Ed TV is more popular than ever . Congratulations . McILVAINE Only , Ed , we want you , in the next few weeks to spend a lot more time with your family .
ED: You do ?
SEAVER: Definitely . Cynthia , explain it to him . Cynthia just stares at her , COLDLY .
SCHARLACH: In fact , we have a new concept . Since your family signed eleases , we can follow them on camera even when you 're not with them . We can cut around from family member to family member . Whoever 's the most exciting at that moment . McILVAINE And , of course , it 's another big onus payment for you . Pause .
ED: A couple of years ago my Uncle Roy got bit on the ass by a dog . Silence . What the hell is he talking about ?
SCHARLACH: I see .
ED: You know what that is ? It 's sad . I mean it was just so we could be heard . So we could stand out from the crowd for a second . So we did it . But we had nothing to say . Just `` Whoop '' . That 's it . And the stupid part I mean the eally stupid part is we thought it like elevated us above the crowd . Where the fact is it made us stupider than the crowd .
SCHARLACH: I see .
ED: Stop saying `` I see . '' You do n't see . Cynthia , I owe you an apology .
CYNTHIA: I do n't think so .
ED: Yeah . Because , you did n't talk me into anything . Everything you wanted me to do , I wanted to do .
MR. SCHARLACH: Well , Ed , that 's not really possible .
ED: All right , I'11 pay for the parking . Big network !
SCHARLACH: No , I mean you ca n't quit . Ed thinks .
ED: I ca n't ?
MR. SCHARLACH: Well , no . You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to . The station entered into this on that understanding . If you had refused we 'd have begun this with somebody else . You ca n't just change the rules in the middle of the game , son . It 's not fair to us . More importantly , it 's not fair to the viewers . They 're interested in you . They 've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you .
ED: Look , if you do n't let me out of this I'11 just I'11 just sit in my apartment all day . I wo n't go anywhere , I wo n't do anything . What kind of show will that be ?
MR. SCHARLACH: Not too good . That 's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life , you 're in violation and are liable for the station 's financial losses . Ed , I urge you to reconsider . I urge you on ehalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours . Play fai with them , Ed .
ED: All right . Let them decide . He turns right to the camera .
GREG: Ratings are up across the board . Look at this ! Men 18 to 35 , women 18 to 35 Cynthia stares , amazed .
STEVE: This contract you signed ? It 's a masterpiece . Do n't go to wa with these guys . You fart in the wrong direction they can take everything you own and leave you naked by the side of the road . You ever going to get back with that Jill ? Ooh she was nice . Shari , I did n't like that much `` yet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet . ''
ED: Shut up .
SHARI: 1 bailed . I bailed on you .
ED: Kinda ' .
SHARI: It 's what I do . I yell `` Geronimo '' and jump out of a elationship . He laughs . Pause .
ED: What did you do to your hair ?
SHARI: My truck overheated , so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt . So I had to get a haircut .
ED: It 's nice .
MILDRED: Um Mr. Scharlach , um you 're not watching TV ?
SCHARLACH: No , Mildred , we 're working .
MILDRED: Um Ed and Shari are
SEAVER: Engaged ?
MILDRED: No . Here . They 're in the uilding . They 're on their way up .
ED: Hi , kids . Busy ?
HONCHO #1: Well , we were thinking
ED: Shut up . He takes back that Honcho 's hat .
SHARI: What do we have to do ?
ED: My lovely assistant , Shari . I 'm glad you asked . The contest is who can dig up legally , of course I 'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV . The Honchos staring blankly .
SHARI: So act now . Here 's Ed 's home phone number . She holds up a CARD .
SCHARLACH: Legal ? ! How can this be legal ? It 's defamation ! It 's slander ! It 's
LAWYER: Not , technically . He is not showing a reckless disregard fo the truth .
SCHARLACH: You 're fired ! The meeting continues ANGRILY .
RAY: Uh-huh uh-huh Really ? ! She was how old ?
AL: He pays a prostitute to do what to him ? I do n't even want that on my shoes .
SCHARLACH: Stop laughing or you 're fired . She stops . Then she gets up .
CYNTHIA: I 've got this great idea . We put together a video . `` The Network Executives Goofiest Moments . '' And listen , i 've really loved working here .
ED: Okay . We have a winner . Now please do n't feel badly if yours was n't selected . In our eyes , you 're all winners .
RAY: And each contestant gets one of these . An `` I tried to screw a network executive '' tee-shirt .
ED: A hundred per cent cotton . Okay , here we go , Andy .

DOLORES: Ed , you 're still young . This is the part of your life when you 're u > supposed to be struggling .
ED: I know But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it 's gon na get Dolores kisses Ed affectionately .
DOLORES: Things 'll change for us . Nobody stays on the fringe forever .

ED: What are you ladies gabbin ' about ?
SECRETARY #1: You know that Christine Jorgensen freak ? He/she/it 's in `` Variety . '' Some producer is making a biopic .
ED: R-really ? I did n't see the story .
SECRETARY #1: Ah , it was buried in the back . The guy 's a real smallótime operator .
DOLORES: Eddie , I do n't understand . Why are u > you the most qualified director fo the Christine Jorgensen Story ?
ED: Aw , er , it 's just a bunch of hot air . I had to say something to get in the door .
GEORGIE: Can I help you ?
ED: Yes , I 'm Ed Wood . I 'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture .
GEORGIE: Yeah , well a couple of things have changed . It ai n't gon na be the Christine Jorgensen story no more . Goddamn `` Variety '' printed the story efore I had the rights , and now that itch is asking for the sky .
ED: So you 're not gon na make the movie ?
GEORGIE: No , of COURSE I 'm gon na make the movie ! I 've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma . Those repressed Okies eally go for that twisted pervert stuff . So we 'll just make it without that she-male . We 'll fictitionalize it .
ED: Is there a script ?
GEORGIE: Fuck no ! But there 's a poster .
ED: Well , Mr. Weiss , I 'm your guy . I work fast , and I 'm a deal I write AND direct . And I 'm good . I just did a play in Hollywood , and Victo Crowley praised its realism .
GEORGIE: Hmm . There 's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing . You said on the phone you had some kind of `` special qualifications . ''
ED: Well , Mr. Weiss , I 've never told anyone what I 'm about to tell you ut I really want this job . I like to dress in women 's clothing .
GEORGIE: Are you a fruit ?
ED: No , no , not at all ! I love women . Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them .
GEORGIE: So you 're not a fruit ?
ED: Nah , I 'm all man . I even fought in
GEORGIE: You got ta be kiddin ' me .
ED: Confidentially , I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties . I 'll tell ya , I was n't scared of eing killed , but I was terrified of getting wounded , and having the medics discover my secret . Georgie sits back . It 's a hell of a story .
GEORGIE: And this is why you think you 're the most qualified to make my movie ?
ED: Yeah . I know what it 's like to live with a secret , and worry about what people are gon na think of you My girlfriend still does n't know why he sweaters are always stretched out . Georgie shrugs .
GEORGIE: Ed , you seem like a nice kid , but look around you I do n't hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories . I make movies like `` Chained Girls . '' I need someone with experience who can shoot a film in four days that 'll make me a profit . I 'm sorry . That 's all that matters .
BARTENDER: Are you gon na get something else ?
BELA: Too constrictive . This is the most uncomfortable coffin I have ever been in .
SALESMAN: Gee , Mr. Lugosi , I 've never had any complaints before .
BELA: The selection is quite shoddy . You are wasting my time .
ED: Excuse me , Mr . Lugosi ? ?
BELA: I told you , I do n't want any of you goddamn coffins .
ED: No . I do n't work here .
BELA: Huh ?
ED: I do n't want anything . I 'm just a eally big , big fan . I 've seen all your movies .
BELA: Ha ! Bela strides out .
ED: Why were you buying a coffin ?
BELA: Because I 'm planning on dying soon .
ED: Really ?
BELA: Yes . I 'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of `` Dracula . '' Twelve cities in ten days , if that 's conceivable .
ED: You know , I saw you perform `` Dracula . '' In Poughkeepsie , in 1938 .
BELA: Eh , that was a terrible production . Renfield was a drunk !
ED: I thought it was great . You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie .
BELA: Thank you .
ED: I waited to get your autograph , but you never came outside .
BELA: I apologize . When I play Dracula , I put myself into a trance . It takes me much time to re-emerge . A CITY BUS approaches .
ED: Do n't you bave a car ?
BELA: I refuse to drive in this country . Too many madmen .
ED: Boy , Mr. Lugosi , you must lead such an exciting life . When is your next picture coming out ?
BELA: I have no next picture .
ED: Ah , you got ta be jokin ' ! A great man like you I 'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up .
BELA: Back in the old days , yes . But now no one give two fucks for Bela . Bela puffs on his oversized cigar .
ED: But you 're a big star !
BELA: No more . I have n't worked in fou years . This town , it chews you up , then spits you out . I 'm just an ex-bogeyman . Make a right .
ED: The old ones were much spookier . They had castles , full moons
BELA: They were mythic . They had a poetry to them . And you know what else ? The women prefer the traditional monsters .
ED: The women ?
BELA: The pure horror , it both repels and attracts them . Because in thei collective unconsciousness , they have the agony of childbirth . The blood . The blood is horror .
ED: I never thought of that .
BELA: Take my word for it . You want to `` score '' with a young lady , you take her to see `` Dracula . ''
ED: Well I guess I should go . Perhaps we could get together again ?
BELA: Certainly . But now the children of the night are calling me .
ED: Sweetie , you wo n't believe it ! I 've got the most incredible news !
DOLORES: You got the job ? ! !
ED: Huh ? ! Oh , uh , no , I did n't get the job . But something better happened !
DOLORES: Better than not getting a job ?
ED: Yeah ! I met a movie star ! Somebody u > really big !
DOLORES: Who ? Robert Taylor ? !
ED: No ! A horror movie star !
DOLORES: Boris Karloff ! ?
ED: Close ! The other one !
DOLORES: You met Basil Rathbone !
ED: Oh , the hell with you . I met BELA
DOLORES: I thought he was dead . Ed 's eyes pop .
ED: No ! He 's very alive . Well sort of . He 's old , and frail but he 's still Bela Lugosi ! And he 's really nice .
DOLORES: Boy , I ca n't even remember the last time he was in a picture .
ED: It 's a shame . He 's such a rest actor , and nobody uses him anymore .
DOLORES: So did you get his autograph ? Ed calms down . He smiles beatifically .
ED: No . It was n't like that at all . It was just the two of us , and we were talkin ' and he treated me like a friend
RUDE BOSS: He 's a bum .
ED: No he 's not ! Do you realize how much money he made for this studio ove the years ? `` Dracula '' ! `` The Raven '' ! `` The Black Cat '' !
RUDE BOSS: Yeah ? Well now he 's a junkie . He do n't deserve to work .
ED: That 's not true
RUDE BOSS: He 's so great , you hire him .
ED: Well , uh , if I could I would
BELA: I think she 's a honey . Look at those jugs .
ED: Hey Bela , how do you do that ?
BELA: You must be double-jointed , and you must be Hungarian . Vampira , look at me ! Stare into my eyes .
ED: Do you want me to get it for you ?
BELA: No thank you , Eddie . I 'll be alright .
BELA: Are n't you scared , little boy ? I 'm going to drink your blood !
TOUGH BOY: Ehh , you 're not a real vampire . You ca n't turn into a bat , and those teeth do n't frighten me . Suddenly Ed lurches out , menacingly .
ED: Well how about these teeth ? ! !
BELA: Hey , how 'd you do that ?
ED: Dentures . I lost my pearlies in the war .
BELA: Do n't worry . I do it every Halloween .
ED: Now what ?
BELA: I am DRACULA ! Bela darts happily through the graves . His cape flies behind him .
GEORGIE: So what 's the big news you could n't tell me over the phone again ?
ED: Mr. Weiss , I was thinkin ' about what you said , about how all your movies have to make a profit . And I ealized , what 's the one thing , that if you put in a movie , it 'll be successful ? ?
GEORGIE: Tits .
ED: No . Better than tits a star ! Georgie shakes his head .
GEORGIE: Eddie , you must have me confused with David Selznick . I do n't make majo motion pictures . I make crap .
ED: Yeah , but if you took that crap and put a star in it , you 'd have something !
GEORGIE: Yeah . Crap with a star .
ED: No ! It would be something better ! Something impressive . The biggest moneymaker you 've ever had !
GEORGIE: Fine , maybe you 're right . But it does n't friggin ' matter . I ca n't afford a star , so I do n't even know what we 're talking about . Ed grins .
ED: What if I told you you could have a star for $ 1000 ? ?
GEORGIE: Who ?
ED: Yeah ! Lugosi !
GEORGIE: Is n't he dead ?
ED: No , he 's not dead ! He lives in Baldwin Hills . I met him recently , and he wants to be in our picture .
GEORGIE: OUR picture ?
ED: Uh , yeah . Our picture . Georgie mulls this over . He 's interested .
GEORGIE: Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick ?
ED: Because he 's my friend .
GEORGIE: Alright , fine ! You can direct it . I want a script in three days , and we start shooting a week from Monday .
ED: Thank you ! Bless you , Mr. Weiss ! I promise I wo n't let you down !
BELA: Eddie , you got a new movie for me ? !
ED: Yeah , it 's gon na be a great picture ! You 'll love your character ! Bunny , Bela 's here . Look , hit the ars , work some parties , and get me transvestites ! I need transvestites !
BELA: Eddie , what kind of movie is this ?
ED: Well , It 's about how people have two personalities . The side they show to the world , and then the secret person they hide inside .
BELA: Oh , like Jekyll and Hyde ! Ah , I 've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde ! I 'm looking forward to this production . Ed stops typing . He pours Bela a drink .
ED: Ehh , your part 's a little different . You 're like the God that looks down on all the characters , and oversees everything .
BELA: I do n't understand .
ED: Well you control everyone 's fate . You 're like the puppetmaster .
BELA: Ah , so I pull the strings !
ED: Yeah . You pull the strings `` Pull the strings '' hey , that 's pretty good ! Ed quickly starts typing again .
DOLORES: Ed , I 'm so proud ! I 'll read it as soon as I get home .
ED: Well , I 'd really like to know what you think . Why do n't you go in the edroom and take a look at it ? I 'll Wait
DOLORES: So that 's where my sweater 's been .
ED: Since I was a kid . My mom wanted a girl , so she used to dress me in girlie clothing . It just kinda ecame a habit .
DOLORES: Jesus Christ ! And you never told me ?
ED: This is my way of telling you
DOLORES: What , by putting it in a fuckin ' script , for everyone to see ? ! What kind of sick mind would operate like that ?
ED: Of course it is . And that 's why you should play the part .
DOLORES: Oh ! You got nerve , buddy .
ED: It 's a damn good role .
DOLORES: That 's not the issue ! ! Ugh ! How can you act so casual , when you 're dressed like that ? !
ED: It takes me comfortable .
DOLORES: Oh , just like in the script ! Ed smiles serenely .
ED: Exactly . So what do ya say ? Do you wan na eak up or do you wan na do the movie with me ? Dolores sighs .
CONRAD: It 's good to have a job . Now I can get my phone reconnected .
GEORGIE: I thought this was gon na be a sex- change film !
ED: There 's still a sex-change
GEORGIE: Yeah ! Five pages right before it ends ! The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters .
ED: I do n't think he 's a schmuck .
GEORGIE: And what 's with this new title ? ! My poster says `` I CHANGED MY SEX '' !
ED: So change the poster . Trust me , you 'll be better off . This is a story that 's gon na grab people . It 's about this guy . He 's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses . Should he tell her ? Should he not tell her ? He 's torn . George , this is DRAMA . Georgie throws up his hands
GEORGIE: Fine , shoot whatever baloney you want ! I give up . Just make sure u > it 's seven reels long .
ED: Everybody , we 're about to embark on quite a journey . Four days of hard work but when it 's over , we 'll have a picture that 'll entertain , enlighten , and maybe even move millions of people . A COUPLE GRIPS glance at each other .
CAMERAMAN BILL: Excuse me Eddie , I do n't mean to interrupt but I 'm gettin ' a little worried about those clouds .
ED: Good thinkin ' . We 'll talk about Days Three and Four later . Now let 's get that first shot off ! It 's Scene 17 , Glenda looking in the window .
ED: Okay , do I need any touch-up ?
CAMERAMAN BILL: Rolling .
ED'S VOICE: And ACTION !

CAMERAMAN BILL: Do n't you want a second take , fo protection ?
ED: What 's to protect ? It was perfect ! Suddenly a police car turns the corner .
CREW MEMBER: Cops !
ED: We do n't have a permit . RUN ! Everyone grabs equipment and takes off .
PAUL MARCO: I do n't know .
ED: Well it looks good . Let 's use it !
GEORGIE: Ed ! What 's with these revised pages ? ! A scene in a smelting factory ? A buffalo stampede ? ? u > Three-hundred soldiers storming AnzioBeach ? ? ! What 's going on here ? I ca n't afford to film this nonsense !
ED: Do n't worry . We 're not gon na film any of it .
GEORGIE: Then how 's it gon na get in thepicture ? !
ED: I know a guy in Universal 's stock house he 's giving me the footage for free . This movie 's gon na look like a million bucks . Georgie nods . Oh , okay .
O.S. VOICE: Mr. Lugosi has arrived ! Ed jumps excitedly .
ED: Oh my God ! Mr. Lugosi is here ! Now everyone , when he walks on the stage Now everyone , when he walks on the stage , treat him normal . I know Bela Lugosi is a world-famous star , and you 're all a little excited , but we 're professionals . So if you treat him with respect , everything will be alright .
BELA: I am always on time .
ED: Of course ! Well , we got a big day planned for you First , we 're gon na start off a little easy , with you in that armchair over there . Then , once you 're up to speed and cooking , we 'll eset and bring out the laboratory equipment
BELA: Uh , Eddie , do you have my money ?
ED: Huh ? ! Oh yeah , of course . Ed and Bela step over to a corner .
CONRAD: Mr. Lugosi , I know you 're very busy , ut could I have your autograph ?
BELA: Of course .
CONRAD: You know which movie of yours I love , Mr. Lugosi ? `` The Invisible Ray . '' You were great as Karloff 's sidekick . Bela 's face suddenly hardens . He snaps .
BELA: `` Sidekick '' ? ? `` KARLOFF '' ? ! ! Bela insanely RIPS up the autograph .
ED: What happened ? ! Jesus , Connie , what did you do ?
CONRAD: Nothin ' ! I told him he was great .
BELA: How dare that asshole bring up Karloff ? ! ! You think it takes talent to play Frankenstein ? ! NO ! It 's just make-up and grunting ! GRRR !
ED: You 're right , Bela . Now Dracula , u > that 's a part that takes acting .
BELA: Of course ! Dracula requires u > presence . It 's all in the voice , and the eyes , and the hand
ED: Look , you seem a little agitated . Do you maybe wan na take a little eak , go for a nice walk and then we 'll come back and shoot the scene ?
BELA: BULLSHIT ! I am ready now ! Roll the camera ! ! The crew is baffled . Ed shrugs at them .
ED: Um , okay roll camera
CAMERAMAN BILL: Rolling .
ED: Sound !
SOUNDMAN: Speed .
CAMERA ASSISTANT: Mark . Scene Thirty-One .
ED: And action ?
DOLORES: How can you just walk around like that , in front of all these people ?
ED: Hon ' , nobody 's bothered but you . Look around they could n't care less .
DOLORES: Ed , this is n't the real world ! You 've surrounded yourself with
ED: Say it a little louder . I do n't think Bela heard you in his trailer . Dolores quiets down . She feels bad .
GEORGIE: I think it 's fifty-seven minutes long .
ED: Yeah ? Whatever . So did you like it ?
GEORGIE: Ed , what was the one thing I asked you to do ? Make it seven reels long . I 've got contracts with my exhibitors . If it ai n't over an hour , they wo n't play it .
ED: Gee , I used every frame of film we shot . Maybe they wo n't notice .
GEORGIE: They 'll notice . Look , why do n't you let me take ove from here ? I can do a few tricks Pad it out with more stock footage , add establishing shots
ED: Um , I guess
GEORGIE: Good . And one more thing . I think your `` Written , Directed , and Starring Ed Wood '' credit is a bad idea .
ED: Why ? ! I did all those things ! Hell , I even built the props .
GEORGIE: And you did a bang-up job , too . But you do n't want other producers to know that 's you in drag . Trust me . It 's a career killer . Ed is quite upset .
ED: But I 'm proud . I wrote , directed , and starred in it just like Orson Welles in `` Citizen Kane '' !
GEORGIE: Yeah ? ? Well Orson Welles did n't wear angora sweaters , did he ? ? ! Ed is beaten .
BUNNY: Daniel Who ? ! Dolores leans in to Ed .
DOLORES: Ed , who is Daniel Davis ?
ED: Some weirdo who likes to wea dresses .
CAMERAMAN BILL: I did n't shoot that !
ED: Georgie , what 's with the stag footage ? ? You said you were cutting in establishing shots !
GEORGIE: I did . I established some tits and ass .
BELA: Was n't I something.. ? Did you see how I command the screen ? !
BUNNY: Ed , it was superb .
CONRAD: A great show ! A little strange ut great especially my scenes .
ED: Just like I always promised . Now you 're among the immortals . You 're movie stars .
PAUL MARCO: Here 's to Ed . For making us into something .
ED: From today on , our lives are different ! We 'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did .
DOLORES: I do n't know . It 's so much money
ED: Who cares ? ! We 're on a ROLL ! These are the moments in life you 're supposed to grab .
DOLORES: But Ed , we 're not even married . And you do n't have a job .
ED: But you do ! And anyway , I 've got tons of new scripts . And now that I have a track record , studios are ound to hire me !
DOLORES: Toss us out on our ass .
ED: Exactly .
BELA: But , I do n't like horses . Do I have to get on one ?
ED: Eh , forget it . What else is big ? Teenagers ! Jailbait pics ! Yeah You got the juvenile delinquent , his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks
BELA: Who do I play ?
ED: Uh , a cop . NO ! You play the father . He 's angry ! He does n't like seeing his son no he does n't like seeing his daughter behave this way !
BELA: Well ca n't I play the romantic part ? I 'm tired of always being the ad guy . You know , back in Hungary , I played Romeo ! I would like to be the lover again me , in a boat , with the girl Ed considers this .
ED: Sure . Romance , that 's great ! To engineer your comeback , we 're gon na need a whole slate of pictures . Once `` Glen Or Glenda '' takes off , we 'll slam you into one , then another , then another !
BELA: That 's good . I could use the money .
ED: But we need to start off with a bang ! Something we know the audience will want to see . Mmm . What was you iggest hit ?
BELA: Hmm my biggest hit ? That would probably be `` Dracula . ''
ED: Of course !
BELA: Those bastards at Universal . I made so much money for them , and now I ca n't get the time of day .
ED: So let 's make another `` Dracula . '' Let 's make `` The Return of Dracula '' !
BELA: We ca n't . Those sons-a-bitches control the rights .
ED: They do ? Shoot . There must be a way to get around that
BELA: Dracula ?
ED: No ! Doctor Acula ! You can still wear the cape , have the fangs ut you 're a doctor ! Not a count .
BELA: Ah ! This is very exciting .
ED: I got ta type this up , while it 's still fresh !
GUARD: What 's your name ?
ED: Edward D. Wood , Junior .
GUARD: Oh . Eh , he 's in the Executive Building . You can park in the eserved section . Ed smiles .
SECRETARY: Sir , Mr. Feldman will see you now .
MR. FELDMAN: Mr. Ward , it 's a delight to meet you .
ED: It 's Wood . Ed Wood .
MR. FELDMAN: Wood ? Ward ? Wood . Hey , what do you know . It is Wood . Dang secretaries , you can never get a good one . Right ? Ed shrugs . Feldman grins .
ED: Well , Mr. Feldman , some people have esumes to show . I 've got my own movie .

ED: I just made this picture , over at Screen Classics . It opens next week .

MR. FELDMAN: I ca n't wait to take a look . So what 's up next ? Ed leans in .
ED: Well , Mr. Feldman , I do n't believe in thinking small . So I 've got a whole slate of pictures for you `` The Vampire 's Tomb , '' `` The Ghoul Goes West '' and `` Doctor Acula '' !
MR. FELDMAN: Doctor Acula ? I do n't get it .

MR. FELDMAN: Oh , `` Dr . Acula . '' I get it . I do n't like it .
ED: But Bela Lugosi 's in it !
MR. FELDMAN: Lugosi 's washed-up . What else you got ?
ED: Well I 've got another project I was n't gon na tell you about . Lugosi 's in it , but he 's got a smaller part . The lead is an ingenue , a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller . The title is `` Bride Of The Atom . ''
MR. FELDMAN: Ah ! Atomic Age stuff , huh ? I like it . I 'll tell you what , Mr. Ward . Why do n't you leave those film cans , and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus . Maybe we can do business together . Ed is elated .
EXECUTIVE #1: What the hell is this ? !
EXECUTIVE #2: Is this an actual movie ? !
EXECUTIVE #1: It ca n't be .
EXECUTIVE #2: It 's fuckin ' ridiculous ! Feldman squints at the screen .
FELDMAN: Wait a minute . That guy in the dress he 's the one I met with today ! This must be a big PUT-ON ! It 's probably another one of Billy Wellman 's practical jokes !
ED: Georgie , what happened ? ! I thought `` Glen Or Glenda '' was opening next week ! Where 's the ads ?
GEORGIE: `` Where 's the ads '' ? ! The ads are in Alabama , Indiana , and Missouri ! You schmuck , it ai n't gon na play L.A. !
ED: Why not ? ?
GEORGIE: Because I ca n't sell it to save my life ! You made a goddamn feathered fish . Is it an art film , a horro show , a hygiene flick ? Nobody knows ! I 'm beggin ' people to book it .
ED: Maybe it needs special handling .
GEORGIE: Screw you , Wood ! I even sunk more money into different titles `` Transvestite '' `` He Or She ? '' `` I Led Two Lives '' It DOES N'T MATTER ! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit .
ED: You ca n't talk that way about my movie .
GEORGIE: `` Your movie '' ? ! I wish it was you movie ! I wish I had n't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb . If I ever see you again , I 'll kill you ! ! !

BUNNY: Mexico ! And guess what I 'm going to do there ? !
ED: I dunno . Lie on the beach ?
BUNNY: WRONG ! I 'm getting my first series of hormone shots ! And once those abies kick in , they 're gon na remove my organs , and MAKE ME A WOMAN ! Ed is astonished .
ED: Jesus ! Are you serious ?
BUNNY: Yes ! I 've dreamed of it for years , ut your movie made me realize I 've got to take action . GOODBYE , PENIS !
DOLORES: Ssh ! Will you keep it down ?
ED: My God , look at that guy . He 's a mountain !
BUNNY: And once I 'm a woman , Jean-Claude and I are getting married
ED: Ssh ! He 's so big ! He 's a monster ! Can you imagine what that guy would e like in a movie ?
ED: Mr. Johnson , over here ! Tor smiles and lumbers ove
TOR: Da pleasure be mine .

TOR: Tor !
ED: Tor . Have you ever thought about ecoming an actor ?
TOR: Mm , not good-lookink enough .

ED: Well , I think you 'd be a sensation in pictures .
TOR: But what bout accent ? Some people tink I haf too much accent .

WAITRESS: Tor , what can I get ya ?
TOR: I 'll haf eight beers .
WAITRESS: And you ?
ED: Uhh , I 'll have just one .
TOR: And more nuts ! Ed tries to grab Tor 's attention .
ED: So anyway , I 've got this new script , `` Bride Of The Atom , '' and there 's a part you 're ideal for `` Lobo . '' He 's tough . A brute . But he has a heart and at the end he saves the girl .
TOR: I like . When do movie shoot ?
ED: Hopefully , very soon . I 'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM .
BELA: Eddie my friend . Aghast , Ed runs over .
ED: Bela , what happened ? !
BELA: I did n't feel well
ED: Let me take you to the hospital .
BELA: No hospital . Just take me to the couch
ED: Should I call a doctor ?
BELA: Nah . This happens all the time Ed puts a pillow under Bela 's head .
ED: Is there anything I can get you ? Water ? A blanket ?
BELA: Goulash .
ED: I do n't know how to make goulash . Ed sits next to him . An awkward pause .
BELA: Morphine , with a demerol chaser . Eddie , I 'm so broke . I do n't know what I 'm gon na do
ED: Do n't worry . I 'll do something .
DOLORES: Ed , it 's just one man 's opinion !
ED: Bela needs a job I ca n't even get a film going But of course I ca n't I made the worst movie of all time .
DOLORES: That 's ridiculous . Ed sighs .
ED: All I wan na do is tell stories . The things I find interesting
DOLORES: Well maybe you 're not studio kind of material . Maybe you just need to aise the money yourself . Ed looks up .
ED: The movie is called `` Bride Of The Atom ''
BELA: `` Greetings . I am the Count . ''
ED: `` Greetings . I am Slick Slomopavitz , Seeker of Adventure . '' Audience laughs . Applause . `` Say , that 's a funny place to sleep . ''
BELA: `` It is my home . ''
ED: `` Oh , tract housing , huh ? '' Laugh . `` You need a new real estate agent . ''
BELA: `` Beg to differ . This casket incarpratates , er , inporporates `` Ed interrupts .
ED: No Bela , that 's `` incorporates . '' Look , just say `` This casket has ''
BELA: Ach ! How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue ? This live television is madness ! An ASSISTANT knocks and sticks her head in .
ASSISTANT: Five minutes , Mr. Lugosi .
HOST: And then what 's gon na happen ?
CRISWELL: In 1960 , the automobile will have etractable wings , so it can fly .
HOST: Sounds like a heck of a way to beat traffic .
CRISWELL: By 1970 , Man will have colonized Mars . Millions of people will live there . Ed is mesmerized .
ED: Wow ! Ai n't that something .
BELA: Greetings . I am the Count .
HOST: Greetings . I am Slick Slomopavitz , Seeker of Adventure . The audience LAUGHS . Then APPLAUSE .
BELA: It is my home .
HOST: Oh , tract housing , huh ? I guess I should n't complain about my duplex in Burbank . What a dump . Some places have a Murphy bed , this place has a Murphy shower . I still do n't know where to hang the towels !
BELA: Uh , beg to differ .
HOST: `` Beg to differ ? ! '' Hey , I 'm talkin ' about my duplex in Burbank !
BELA: Uh , Greetings . I am the Count
HOST: I told you we should 've gotten Karloff .
ED: Bela , do n't worry . You 're bette than all this crap .
BELA: I never said I could ad-lib
ED: Forget about it . We 'll make our new movie , and you 'll be a star again .
CRISWELL: Mr. Lugosi ! It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you . Allow me to introduce myself I am CRISWELL !
BELA: It 's a pleasure
CRISWELL: Ah , cheer up ! Do n't lose heart ove what happened tonight . I predict that your next project will e an outstanding success !
ED: Wow .
CRISWELL: And who may you be ?
ED: Edward Wood , Sir .
CRISWELL: Ah . The director of `` Glen O Glenda . ''
ED: H-how 'd you know ? !
CRISWELL: I 'm Criswell . I know all . Criswell winks .
BELA: No . I never drink wine .
ED: Hey Cris , how 'd you know we 'd be living on Mars by 1970 ? How 'd you know it would n't be 1975 , or even
CRISWELL: I guessed .
ED: I do n't understand .
CRISWELL: I made it up . It 's horseshit ! Ed 's jaw drops .
ED: It 's that easy ?
CRISWELL: Eddie , we 're in show biz ! It 's all about razzle-dazzle . Appearances . If you dress nice and talk well , people will swallow anything .
CONSERVATIVE MAN: Excuse me . We 're here for the Wood party .
DOORMAN: Ah , that would be in the Venetian Room , sir .
ED: We 're gon na have the most terrifying monster ever seen on film ! A ghastly creature created from an atomic mutation !
BACKER'S WIFE: I do n't like scary movies . I go more for ones with love stories .
ED: Well that 's what this movie is a heartbreaking romance ! It 's about a young reporter , Janet Lawton , in love with a young cop , Dick Craig .
CONRAD: These shoes are itchy .
ED: You ca n't sit ! You got ta walk around , with good posture . You want these people to think we have class . Otherwise they 'll never invest in ou movie .
AMAZED BACKER: Bernie , get a load of this guy !
TOR: Biceps 22 ! Chest 62 ! Stomach 54 !
AMAZED BACKER: Whew ! You 're quite a specimen . And you 're gon na be in the picture ?
TOR: Yes . I play Lobo !
HICK BACKER: Mr. Lugosi , I ca n't believe I 'm meeting you in person . This is one of the most exciting moments of my life .
BELA: Thank you . And you are ?
HICK BACKER: Charlie Johnson ! I manufacture toothpaste tubes .
CRISWELL: I predict `` Bride Of The Atom '' will e the biggest moneymaker of all time !
ED: And this is lovely starlet Dolores Fuller , who will play Janet Lawton .
SOUTHERN BACKER: And how much will this picture cost ?
ED: In a normal studio it would be half-a-million , with all thei wasteful overhead and fancy offices . But because we 're more efficient , we can bring it in for seventy grand !
SOUTHERN BACKER: Hmm . Well I 'll consider it
ED: Goodbye ! Goodbye !
BELA: So how 'd we do ?
ED: We did n't make a dime .
VALET: That 's twenty-five cents , sir . The man glances at his Wife . She shrugs .
WIFE: I gave all my money to the abysitter .
DOLORES: Ed , the landlord called again . He wants his money .
ED: Tell him `` Bride '' is in pre- production .
DOLORES: Ed , the landlord does n't care .
ED: That 's the problem ! Nobody cares about my movie ! I 'm tryin ' so hard , I do n't know what else to do !
DOLORES: Do n't get angry at me . Maybe you just need a day job .
ED: Dolores , do n't you understand ? I 'm a director now ! I made `` Glen O Glenda . '' Directing is my day job .
DOLORES: All I know is , ever since `` Glen O Glenda , '' all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes !
PAUL MARCO: Uh , yoo-hoo . Excuse me ! Sorry to interrupt , but I got some big news .
ED: Yeah ?
PAUL MARCO: Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East . She 's from `` old money , '' and he thinks she 's loaded . And here 's the kicker She 's veryinterested in the picture business !
LORETTA: Pleased to meet you . I 'm Loretta King .
ED: I understand you just moved here ?
LORETTA: Yes . Hollywood is oh so exciting . A WAITER walks over , with a water pitcher .
WAITER: Water , Ma'am ?
LORETTA: No ! No water ! NO LIQUIDS ! I 'm terribly allergic to them !
ED: So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture .
LORETTA: Perhaps a small amount of money . How much do one of your motion pictures cost ?
ED: For this one , we need $ 60,000 .
LORETTA: That 's all ? ? That seems very easonable for an entire picture . Ed perks up . She 's a live one !
ED: Perhaps you 'd like to look at the photoplay .
LORETTA: Oh my , this is very interesting . Say do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts ?
ED: Oh , of course ! ! There 's a couple characters you 'd be perfect for The secretary at the newspaper office , or the file clerk !
LORETTA: Hmm . Those sound kind of small . Oh , here 's one that looks good Janet Lawton . I 'd sure like to play her . Ed blanches .
ED: J-Janet Lawton ? ? ?
LORETIA: Yes , Janet Layton is clearly the part to play . She 's got some real meaty scenes ! Ca n't you just see me in that part ? ?
ED: Uh yeah You 'd be perfect .
DOLORES: Who do you think 's been paying the ent ? ! Who helped type your script , and did all your grunt work ? !
ED: I 'm sorry ! What did you want me to say ?
DOLORES: I wanted you to say , `` No ! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores . ''
ED: But there 's plenty of other parts .
DOLORES: Like what ? !
ED: The secretary . Or the file clerk . Dolores is stunned .
DOLORES: YOU ASSHOLE !
ED: This is gon na be Bela 's laboratory , so it should be real impressive ! Like one of those mad scientist movies . I want beakers , and test tubes , and one of those electrical things that buzzes !
BUNNY: You mean a Tesla coil ?
ED: If you say so .
TOR: Edvard ! I haf question 'bout script . My vife Greta , she read . And she no like .
ED: Really ? Was the third act too intense ?
TOR: No . She tink Lobo is waste of my time . Lobo do n't talk .
ED: But Tor , it 's a starring part ! You 're second billed .
TOR: Bela , he talk . Loretta , she talk . But Tor , he no talk . Ed thinks . He quickly puts a spin on this .
ED: Tor , dialogue is overrated . You look at the classic film actors , who are they ? Fairbanks . Chaplin . They did n't talk ! They did it all with their face .
TOR: But Greta say Loretta walks over , holding two dresses .
LORETTA: Eddie , which dress do you like etter ?
ED: I do n't know . Hey Bill , which dress is better fo you , the green or the red one ?
CAMERAMAN BILL: Which one is the red one ?
ED: What do you mean ?
CAMERAMAN BILL: I mean I ca n't see the difference . I 'm color-blind . But I like the dark gray one .
ED: ACTION !
TOR'S VOICE: Yah .
ED: Okay , CUE RAINSTORM !
BELA: At Universal , they shot two scenes a day . Eddie can knock off twenty or thirty ! He 's incredible .
CAMERAMAN BILL: Hey Ed , should n't we do another take ? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway .
ED: No , it 's fine . It 's real ! In actuality , Lobo would struggle with that problem every day .
PAUL MARCO: We could n't afford any more props . If it seems weird , maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner .
ED: Nah , it 'll work . Where 's Bela ? Bela is asleep on a couch . Ed nudges him .
BELA: Mmph ? Where am I ?
ED: You 're shooting `` Bride Of The Atom . '' Scene 85 .
BELA: I 'm not getting near that goddamn thing . One of those burned me on `` The Return Of Chandu . ''
ED: Okay . Then you 'll be sitting on the u > left .
TOR: Okey-dokey .
ED: ACTION !
BELA: `` Dear , you are a woman of supe strength and beauty . A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty shit ! '' Damn ! Eddie , I 'm sorry I ca n't emember all this . I 'm an old man . It 's too long .
ED: That 's fine , Bela . We 're still olling . Just say `` Dear , you 're lovely . ''
BELA: `` Dear , you 're lovely . '' `` Strap her to the table . ''
ED: And , CUT ! ! ! Impeccable !
TOR: I love being movie star !
LORETTA: Ow . Not so hard , Tor .
ED: Okay , I 'll get you the money later .
LORETTA: Well then you should pay him , should n't you ?
ED: Yeah . Exactly ! There 's a pause . They stare at each other .
LORETTA: What are you looking at me like that for ? I already gave you my three hundred .
ED: Yeah . Well I need the othe sixty-thousand .
LORETTA: What other sixty-thousand ?
ED: The other sixty-thousand you said you 'd give me .
LORETTA: You misunderstood . I gave you everything I have in the world Three-hundred dollars .
ED: Oh my God .
BELA: Here we go again . Paul whispers to Bunny .
PAUL MARCO: So is Dolores coming ?
BUNNY: I ca n't imagine why . I would n't put up with a boyfriend who sold me out for three-hundred dollars !
ED: lem me tell you , you ca n't lose . It 's scary ! And if you do n't like that , it 's romantic ! Bela Lugosi portrays Dr. Vornoff , and lovely ingenue Loretta King is reporte Janet Lawton .
POTENTIAL BACKER: Hmm . Lugosi looks pretty old . Which role is Vampira playing ?
ED: Vampira ? Why do you ask ? ?
POTENTIAL BACKER: Well I see her standing over there .
ED: Well she 's playing Could you excuse me one moment ? ? Ed dashes from the room .
VAMPIRA: Yes ?
ED: You do n't know me , but my name is Ed Wood . I 'm a film producer . I 'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece , with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler To Johnson . And I saw you here , and I thought Kismet ! Vampira stares , totally uncomprehending .
VAMPIRA: I do n't understand . Do you want my autograph ?
ED: No . I think my film is perfect fo you .
VAMPIRA: You want me to show it on my TV program ? Well I got nothing to do with that . You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven
ED: No ! I do n't want you to show the movie , I want you to be in it ! See , maybe I should explain We started shooting , but then after three days we got shut down . So we 're having a backers party , to raise some more money . Perhaps you 'd like to come next door and meet some of the ackers ?
VAMPIRA: Uh , look , I 'm with some friends , and we 're about to eat
ED: Please ! It 'll only take a minute . You can have some hors d'oeuvres , and meet my backers ! There 's a really nice dentist from Oxnard
VAMPIRA: Look buddy , I 'm a big star . I 've got eal offers from real studios . I do n't need to blow some dentist fo a part . So forget it !
BACKER: I 'm getting a bad feeling about this . Let 's get out of here .
ED: Where are you guys going ? ! You ca n't leave !
BACKER: Goodbye , Mr. Wood .
ED: You ca n't go ! You have n't seen the storyboards !
DOLORES: I told you this was gon na happen .
ED: Maybe if you 'd come to the backers party , I would 've gotten the money .
DOLORES: That 's moronic . Why would a bit player impress a backer ?
ED: Look , how many times can I say I 'm sorry ? I blew it ! I thought she was ich .
DOLORES: That 's a good reason to dump you girlfriend .
ED: I did n't dump you ! Get it through your skull I just recast the part !
DOLORES: You 're a fuckin ' mess .
ED: So WHAT ? ? Look , we got ta figure out where we 're gon na stay .
DOLORES: I 'm going to my mother 's .
ED: Does she have room for me ? Dolores shakes her head .
DOLORES: I think you should stay with one of your friends .
ED: Bela , I do n't know what I 'm doin ' anymore
BELA: Stop worrying . This is going to aise your spirits .
LECTURER: Thou eternal sun , who has covered the consciousness with thy golden disc , do thou remove the veil so that I may see the truth within ?
ED: What is this place ?
BELA: This is the Philosophical Research Society . A refuge for free thinkers . I 've been coming here for twenty years .
LECTURER: for the truth which is within thee is within me . And I am Truth .
BELA: Most people in this country , they know nothing , about Eastern mysticism . They are afraid of it . But I am open-minded . It gives me hope .
LECTURER: We have the wisdom to govern and the divine right to inherit the earth in good condition . We have the powe to build worlds . Ed leans in to Bela .
ED: Was I wrong to cast Loretta ?
BELA: Bad decisions are easy to live with . Forget . Just keep looking forward .
ED: But was it a bad decision ? At the time , I thought her money would save the movie .
BELA: Eddie , you screwed up .
ED: Yeah , I did .
BELA: In life , the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just do n't know where right or wrong will never be answered . Years ago , the Hungarians contacted me . The government wanted me to come home , to be Minister of Culture .
ED: Really ?
BELA: It was a very impressive offer . Fancy offices , a big home I 'd be treated like a king .
ED: So why did n't you do it ?
BELA: I did n't know if it was a trick . They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag . I am Hungary 's most famous emigrant . they 'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave .
ED: But maybe not .
BELA: Correct . So instead , I stayed here , waiting for my comeback . Always hoping the next film , the next film that would be the one .
ED: Your next film . That will be the one . Bela smiles sweetly .
WRESTLING COACH: Tor , you got a phone call !
TOR: Heh ? NOW ?
WRESTLING COACH: They said it was an emergency !
TOR: Hallo ?
ED'S VOICE: Tor , this is Ed ! Glad I could find you ! I got the money , and we resume shooting tomorrow morning !
TOR: But I 'm in Utah .
ED'S VOICE: Then you 'll have to drive all night ! I 'm counting on you , big guy . Breakfast is at seven . CLICK . Ed hangs up . Tor is flabbergasted .
PAUL MARCO: This is unbelievable ! I woulda bet a million bucks that Ed would n't finish this picture .
CAMERAMAN BILL: It ai n't finished yet . Anything could happen .
BUNNY: Uh-oh . Stay out of scratching distance .
ED: Honey , you made it ! I was n't sure you got my message .
DOLORES: Of course I 'm here . Today is the file clerk 's big scene .
ED: That 's right
DOLORES: I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here . Say , who 's the lug ?
TONY: `` Now Janet , I want you straying away oops staying away from the old Willows Place . '' Ed shrugs .
ED: That 's Tony McCoy . He 's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig .
DOLORES: Oh really ? How much money did he put up ?
ED: None . But his dad gave me fifty grand .
DOLORES: Wood Productions . The mark of quality .
ED: Hey , the movie 's getting made . That 's the main thing .
LORETA: Oh , you 're Dolores ? ! I 've heard so much about you ! I 'm Loretta King . Here , take the chair .
DOLORES: Do n't be silly let Harry finish . You still need more work .
LORETTA: No , I 'm done . All I needed was a touch-up .
DOLORES: Mm , that mole still shows . Loretta frowns . Ed quickly steps in .
ED: Ladies ! You both look fine . Why do n't we talk about the scene ? Okay . Janet Lawton has discovered that Dr. Vornoff bought the old Willows estate . So now she wants to prove that all the monster stories are true .
DOLORES: Eddie , what 's my motivation ?
ED: Oh . Er well you 're the file clerk . You 're hurrying into the next room , when you bump into Janet .
DOLORES: But what 's our relationship ? Are we good friends , or is she just a casual acquaintance ?
ED: Dolores , I got five days to shoot this movie . Quit kidding around .
DOLORES: Of course it was . The FILM runs out .
CRISWELL: Bravo ! Bravo ! Magnifico !
ED: Cris , you made it . Thanks a lot .
CRISWELL: My pleasure . I 'm always happy to assist in a little larceny .
TOR: My head is cold .
CRISWELL: You know how much this car cost me ?
CONRAD: Ten thousand dollars .
CRISWELL: ONE DOLLAR ! Miss Mae West herself sold it to me . She said , Cris , you belong in a pink Cadillac ! Criswell turns to Ed .
ED: I told you , the octopus is made of ubber . This is a piece o ' cake .
PAUL MARCO: Ed , you said you were getting permission .
ED: Uh , I could n't reach the guy he was in meetings all day . But this 'll e great , I promise !
TOR: I 'm no good at climbink .
CRISWELL: Hey , keep it down . My publicist will throttle me if we get caught .
ED: Oh . I thought they kept this open . A pause . Everyone looks at Tor . He grins .
TOR: Lobo will fix !
CONRAD: Wow .
PAUL MARCO: This place gives se the creeps . Let 's get the hell out of here .
ED: Not so fast . First we have to get it down .
PAUL MARCO: You 're sure this is gon na work ?
CRISWELL: Oh my God . We killed him .
ED: Tor ! Are you okay ? !
TOR: Bedder than wrestlink !
ANGRY VOICE: Hey ! What are you doing ? !
CRISWELL: Thank God Tor broke the fence .
TONY: `` Now Janet , I want you staying away from the old Willows Place . ''
ED: You do n't understand ! The octopus is supposed to live in a lake !
CONRAD: This is kind of a stream
ED: NO ! It has to be UNDERWATER ! Ed storms away . Conrad scratches his head .
BELA: Eddie , I 'm so tired I do n't know if I can handle a night shoot
ED: Nonsense ! You look great Look , uh , why do n't you lie down and take a little nap ? We 'll film around you for a while .
PAUL MARCO: What octopus motor ?
ED: You know , to make the legs move
PAUL MARCO: Hey , do n't blame me ! You did n't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling ! Bela stumbles up , with a dazed smile .
BELA: Let 's shoot this fucker ! Where do I go ?
ED: You 'll be fighting with the octopus .
BELA: Out there ? ! What happened to the stream ?
ED: This 'll look a lot better . We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater .
BELA: Oh , for Christ 's sake .
ED: Once you 're in it , it warms up .
BELA: Fuck you ! You come out here . Hey , toss me that J.D .
ED: Bela , somebody misplaced the motor . So when you wrestle the octopus , shake the legs a bit , to make it look like it 's killing you . Bela stares , deadpan .
BELA: Do you know I turned down `` Frankenstein '' ?
ED: Huh ?
BELA: After I did `` Dracula , '' the studio offered me `` Frankenstein '' ! But I turned it down , the part was n't sexy enough . It was too degrading for a ig star like me . The crew glances at Ed .
ED: Bela , I 've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight .

KATHY: Booties for my father . He gets cold in this hospital .
ED: How long 's he been here ?
KATHY: This is my thirteenth pair . Ed nods . He spots the Doctor walk by .
ED: Excuse me . Doctor ? I 'm with Mr. Lugosi . How is he ?
DOCTOR: Well there 's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man . Apparently , he was addicted to morphine , tried to kick it , and got e-addicted to methadone .
ED: Will he be okay ?
DOCTOR: We 'll do our best .
ED: Hi , Lillian .
NURSE: Hi , Ed . Boy , he 's got a lot of visitors today .
ED: He does ? Ed is puzzled . He hurries back .
BELA: Is n't it wonderful ? After all these years , the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi .
ED: Bela , they 're parasites ! They just want to exploit you .
BELA: Fine . Let them ! There is no such thing as bad press . A man from New York even said he 's putting me on the front page ! First celebrity to eve check into rehab . When I get out of here , I will be healthy . Strong ! I will be primed for my comeback !
KATHY: Oh , it 's you again .
ED: Oh , hi .

KATHY: Well , I made him some booties to cheer him up . They 're black to match his cape . She smiles .
ED: Would you maybe like to get a coffee.. ?
DOCTOR: We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild .
ED: Is n't he ?
DOCTOR: No . They say his eligibility ran out years ago .
ED: Look , he does n't have any money ut I 'll give you everything I 've got . I have a few hundred dollars . The Doctor shakes his head grimly .
DOCTOR: That wo n't even begin to cover it . He 's going to have to leave .
ED: Bela , wake up .
BELA: Really ? I do n't feel so great .
ED: No , you look good . And the tests came back fine . C'mon Ed gingerly helps Bela up .
BELA: Eddie , I wan na make another picture . When are we gon na make anothe picture ?
ED: Soon , Bela Soon .
OLD MANAGER: Ed , if I cut a deal for you , I got ta cut one for everybody .
ED: This is different ! It 'll mean so much to me . All I need is a camera and a tripod . No lights , no sound . Nothin ' fancy .
OLD MANAGER: And that 's it ?
ED: And one roll of film . The old guy gives Ed a tough look .
BELA: This is so exciting . Anothe production !
ED: No , this is just the second unit . We 'll do the main footage later .
BELA: Oh . So what is the scene about ?
ED: Uh you 're a very important and espected man . You 're leaving you house and you 're in a hurry to a ig social event . Bela nods . He mulls this over .
BELA: Okay . But what if I 'm not in too big a hurry ? What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life ? To smell a flower ?
ED: That 's great . Let 's do a take .
ED: Okay , roll camera ! Rolling . Scene One , Take One ! And ACTION !
BELA: Eddie , how was I ?
ED: Perfect . Bela is pleased .

KATHY: Oh , flowers ! I did n't know you were so traditional .
ED: I just picked them up on the way over
KATHY: They 're very nice . Let me get my coat .
ED: No . I 'm from back east . You know , All-American small town everybody knew everybody , I was a Boy Scout , my dad worked for the post office
KATHY: Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners .
ED: Nah , 'cause I had my comic books . And I read pulp magazines . And I listened to the radio dramas
KATHY: Oh . I loved those shows ! `` Inne Sanctum '' `` The Shadow ''
ED: Yeah ! Do n't forget `` Mercury Theatre '' And then every Saturday , I 'd go to the little movie theate down the street . I even started ushering there . A creaky GHOST flies overhead .
KATHY: You 're not gon na believe the first picture I ever saw . Your friend 's .
ED: What do you mean ?
KATHY: `` Dracula . '' Ed freaks out .
ED: That 's INCREDIBLE ! That 's the first picture I ever saw ! !
KATHY: That is incredible ! You know , I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie .
ED: I had to sleep with the lights on fo a month . But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that .
KATHY: A few years ago , I actually saw him do `` Dracula '' live . I thought he was much scarier in person .
ED: Kathy , I 'm about to tell you something I 've never told any girl on a first date . But I think it 's important that you know . I like to wear women 's clothes .
KATHY: Huh ?
ED: I like to wear women 's clothes Panties , brassieres , sweaters , pumps it 's just something I do . And I ca n't believe I 'm telling you , ut I really like you , and I do n't want it getting in the way down the oad . Kathy is amazed . She contemplates all this .
KATHY: Does this mean you do n't like sex with girls ?
ED: No ! I love sex with girls .
KATHY: Oh . Okay .
ED: Okay ? Kathy slyly grins .
KATHY: Okay . Ed grins back . A moment .
ED: No , do n't worry , I moved on . I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film , `` Bride Of The Monster . ''
VAMPIRA: Did n't you just make one called `` Bride Of The Atom '' ?
ED: It 's the same film . But the distributor wanted a punchier title . C'mon ! It 's gon na be a big event we 're going all out ! Bela , Tor , and Cris are coming . You 'll have fun ! Vampira rolls her eyes .
TOR: My eyes are killink me .
ED: Do n't worry . We 're almost there .
BELA: Eddie , where are we ? We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago .
CRISWELL: I predict we 're lost .
VAMPIRA: Hey ! You wan na watch the hands ? ?
BELA: Sorry
ED: Has anyone ever been to Downey ?
THEATER MANAGER: Children , if you do n't calm down , there wo n't be the entertainment .
ANGRY KID: It was supposed to start an hour ago !
TOR: My eyes are burnink .
KATHY: Hey look ! There 's the theater .
TOR: Where ? I ca n't see nothink !
FRANTIC USHER: Thank God , you 're here ! They 're tearing the place apart !
TOR: Ow .
FRANTIC USHER: C'mon ! This way !
KATHY: I 've never been to a premiere before . The Usher opens the auditorium doors .
ED: Wow . Go knock 'em dead !
WOMAN'S VOICE: It 's the blind leading the blind !
TOR: Dis is a nightmare .
CRISWELL: It 's show biz .
BELA: What is that ?
VAMPIRA: I think they 're getting ready to burn this place down .
THEATER MANAGER: Children , please ! Be calm !
ED: C'mon ! We 're getting the hell out of here !
TOR: What is happening ?
ED: We 're escaping !
VAMPIRA: We 're gon na die .
ED: Stop !
KATHY: STOP !
BELA: Now that was a premiere . All of them LAUGH .
ED: Did you see that kid grab Vampira 's tits ?
BELA: I envied him . Hell , I envied you too , having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that .
ED: Yeah , she 's really somethin ' .
BELA: I know none of my wives would 've . Ed laughs . Bela puffs his cigar .
ED: I just wish you coulda seen the movie .
BELA: No problem . I know it by heart
TOURIST: Mr. Lugosi , could I have you autograph ?
BELA: Certainly .
TOURIST: Boy , that was incredible . You 're just as good an actor as you always were . Bela puffs out his chest majestically .
BELA: Better . I 'm seventy-four , but I do n't know it . If the brain is young , then the spirit is still vigorous like a young man . Bela turns and smiles wanly at Ed . Ed smiles back .
KATHY: Ed , this spaghetti sauce is delicious .
ED: Thanks . It 's actually the only thing I know how to make . Hey , can you grab that strainer ?
KATHY: What was that ?
ED: Bela died .
PHOTOGRAPHER #1: Whose crazy idea was it to bury him in the cape ?
PHOTOGRAPHER #2: I heard it was in the will . It was how he wanted to be remembered .
VOICE: Do you want me to run it again ? Ed silently nods .
ED: I 'd seen him in a coffin so many times , I expected him to jump out
KATHY: Ed , you 've got to snap out of this . Bela 's dead you 're not !
ED: I might as well be . I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see . I blew it . All he wanted was a comeback that last glory
KATHY: Well you tried
ED: I was a fuckin ' HACK ! I let people ecut the movies , cast thei elatives I let Bela down
REYNOLDS: Mr . Wood ? !
ED: Yeah ?
REYNOLDS: Mr. Wood , you have bounced your third and final rent check .
ED: I 'm real sorry . My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account C'mon in , I 'll write you another one .
REYNOLDS: Hmm , so you 're in the picture usiness ?
ED: You could say that
REYNOLDS: I 'm interested in the picture usiness . My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting eligious films , on the Apostles . But unfortunately , we do n't have enough money .
ED: Raising money is tough .
REYNOLDS: Oh ! Our church has the money for one film . We just do n't have it for all twelve
ED: Okay you know what you do ? You produce a film in a commercially proven genre . And after it 's a hit , you take the profits from that , and make the twelve Apostles ' movies .
REYNOLDS: Would that work ?
ED: Absolutely ! You see this script.. ?
REYNOLDS: Graverobbers from what ? ?
ED: From outer space ! It 's science- fiction . Very big with the kids ! If you make this picture , you 'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED eligious films ! u > And pay my back rent from the profits . Reynolds scratches his head .
REYNOLDS: I do n't know this is all a lot to absorb .
ED: It 's a guaranteed blockbuster !
REYNOLDS: Um , I understand that this science friction is popular but do n't the ig hits always have big stars ?
ED: Yeah , well we 've GOT a big star ! Bela Lugosi ! !
REYNOLDS: u > Lugosi ? ? ! Did n't be pass on ?
ED: Yes , but I 've got the last footage he ever shot !
REYNOLDS: Just , it does n't look like very much .
ED: It 's plenty ! It 's the acorn that will grow a great oak . I 'll just find a double to finish his scenes , and we 'll release it as `` Bela Lugosi 's Final Film '' A beat . Reynolds stares , intrigued
PAUL MARCO: Ed , I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside .
ED: Great ! Bring 'em in ! Bunny , I got ta un . Ed hangs up .
PAUL MARCO: Well I was thinkin ' like , when Bela played `` Fu Manchu . ''
ED: That was Karloff . Paul , you got ta try harder . I do n't want this film to be haif-assed . This time , we go for the quality . Paul turns to go .
KATHY: Do you want your buttons on the left or the right ?
ED: The left . It 's more natural . Hey , I 've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb . What would that be made of ?
KATHY: Uh , atomic energy ?
ED: No . They 're beyond that ! They 're smarter than the humans . What 's more < /u advanced ?
KATHY: Dynamite
ED: No , BIGGER ! What 's the biggest energy ? ?
KATHY: The sun .
ED: Yes ! BINGO ! Solar energy ! Oh that 's gon na seem so scientific . This movie 's gon na be the ultimate Ed Wood film . No compromises . Kathy suddenly jumps up , shocked .
KATHY: Oh my God . Look at this ! She runs over and shows Ed the newspaper .
ED: Those assholes .
KATHY: The poor girl 's out of a job .
ED: Yeah I should give her a call .
VAMPIRA: It 's terrible . People wo n't even eturn my calls . It 's like I do n't exist .
ED: I know what that 's like . Anyway , I brought a copy of the script . You would play the `` Ghoul 's Wife . ''
VAMPIRA: The Ghoul 's Wife ? ! God , I ca n't elieve I 'm doing this
KATHY: You should feel lucky . Ed 's the only guy in town who does n't pass judgment on people .
ED: Hell , if I did , I would n't have any friends . Vampira smiles uncomfortably .
VAMPIRA: Look would it be possible to make the `` Ghoul 's Wife '' a little less prominent , so people wo n't really notice me in the movie ?
ED: You do n't wan na be noticed ?
VAMPIRA: Exactly . Hey , how 'bout this what if I do n't have any lines ? I 'll do the part mute ! Kathy suddenly sees someone .
KATHY: Look , it 's Dr. Tom . Hey , Dr. Tom !
ED: Who 's Dr. Tom ?
KATHY: My chiropractor !
DR. MASON: Kathy , how are you ? ! You 're looking in alignment today .
KATHY: Actually , my neck 's a little funny .
ED: Wait a second . Do n't move !
VAMPIRA: What 's uncanny ?
ED: LOOK AT HIS SKULL !
TOR: He look nutink like Bela !
CONRAD: He 's kinds got his ears .
TOR: You 're stupid !
KATHY: No , cover up his face .
CRISWELL: Ah ! Now I see it .
DR. MASON: `` I want to suck your blood ! '' Everybody CRACKS up . Ed waves his arms .
ED: SHHH ! We want these Baptists to like us .
REVEREND LEMON: Brothers and Sisters , we 've reached a special part of the service . The aptism of our new members ! If the congregation will oblige , we 'd like to adjourn and reconvene at Emma DuBois 's back yard .
CRISWELL: Why could n't we do this in the church ?
VAMPIRA: Because `` Brother Torî could n't fit in the sacred tub .
REVEREND LEMON: Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior ?
ED: I do . Reynolds DUNKS Ed in the water .
REVEREND LEMON: Do you reject Satan and all his works ?
BUNNY: I do . Reynolds DUNKS Bunny .
REVEREND LEMON: Do you repent for all your sins ?
TOR: I do . Tor winks slyly at Criswell .
REYNOLDS: Oh my God , I dropped him Tor lies on the bottom , staring lifeinsly .
CRISWELL: I do n't think he 's coming up !
REVEREND LEMON: Lord no ! The man 's drowning !
REYNOLDS: What do we do ? !
REVEREND LEMON: Help ! HELP ! ! !
TOR: Tor make good joke ! The Baptists are n't amused .
VAMPIRA: This ca n't be the right address
TOR: I am so happy ! Finally I am star wit u > dialogue ! I memorized every wordt . Eddie will be so proud !
REYNOLDS: Before we start shooting , Mr. Wood , we have a few questions
REVEREND LEMON: The script refers on numerous occasions to graverobbing . Now we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground highly offensive . It 's blasphemy .
ED: What are you talking about ? ! It 's the premise of the movie . It 's even the title , for Christ 's sake !
REVEREND LEMON: Mr. Wood !
REYNOLDS: Yes , about that title , it strikes us as very inflammatory . Why do n't we change it to `` Plan Nine From Outer Space '' ? Ed shakes his head .
ED: That 's ridiculous !
ED: And , ACTION ! Tor steps onto the set TOR `` Medicul eksaminer been aroundt yet ? ''
COP: `` Just left . The morgue wagon oughta e along most any time . ''
TOR: `` You get statement frumk vitnesses ? ''
COP: `` Yeah , but they 're pretty scared . ''
TOR: `` Findink mess like dis oughta make anyone frightened . Have one of da oyz take dem back to town . You take jarge . ''
REYNOLDS: What 'd you give him all the lines for ? ? He 's unintelligible !
ED: Look , Lugosi is dead and Vampira wo n't talk . Ihad to give somebody < /u the dialogue .
REVEREND LEMON: That 's not an answer .
ED: See , no talking . Is n't he good ?
REVEREND LEMON: Does n't this strike you as a bit morbid ?
ED: No , he would 've loved it ! Bela 's eturned from the grave like Dracula .
REYNOLDS: `` Perfect '' ? Mr. Wood , do you know u > anything about the art of film production ? !
ED: I like to think so .
REYNOLDS: That cardboard headstone tipped over . This graveyard is obviously phony !
ED: People wo n't notice . Filmmaking is n't about picky details it 's about the big picture .
REYNOLDS: Oh , you wan na talk about the `` big picture '' ? ! How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight , but now it 's suddenly night ? ? ? Ed suddenly flips out . He 's livid .
ED: YOU DO N'T KNOW ANYTHING ! Have n't you ever heard of `` suspension of disbelief '' ? !
REVEREND LEMON: This is our choir director . He 's gon na play the young hero .
ED: Are you IN5ANE ? I 'm the director ! u > I make the casting decisions around here !
REVEREND LEMON: I thought this was a group effort .
ED: NOOOOO ! ! !
REVEREND LEMON: Mr. Wood ? What do you think you'redoing ? !
ED: I 'm directing .
REYNOLDS: Not like THAT , you 're not !
REVEREND LEMON: Remove that get-up immediately . You shame our Lord . Ed throws up his hands .
ED: That 's it . I give up !
ORSON WELLES: Yes ?
ED: Uh , uh , I 'm a young filmmaker , and a really big fan and I just wanted to meet you .
ORSON WELLES: My pleasure . I 'm Orson Welles .
ED: Oh . Um , I 'm Ed Wood ! So , what are you working on now ?
ORSON WELLES: Eh , the financing just fell through for the third time on `` Don Quixote . '' So I 'm trying to finish a promo fo something else . But I ca n't find the soundtrack I think I left it in Malta . Ed is astonished .
ED: I ca n't believe it . These sound like u > my problems !
ORSON WELLES: It 's the damn money men . You neve know who 's a windbag , and who 's got the goods . And then they all think u > they 're a director
ED: Ai n't that the truth ! I 've even bad producers recut my movies
ORSON WELLES: Ugh , I hate when that happens .
ED: And they always want to cast thei uddies it does n't even matter if they 're right for the part !
ORSON WELLES: Tell me about it . I 'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal , and they want Charlton Heston to play a u > Mexican ! Ed shakes his head . He 's discouraged .
ED: Mr. Welles , is it all worth it ?
ORSON WELLES: It is when it works . You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch ? `` Kane . '' The studio hated it but they did n't get to touch a frame . Ed , visions are worth fighting for . Why spend your life making someone else 's dreams ?
ED: Wow .
REYNOLDS: Yes ?
ED: We are gon na finish this film justthe way I want it ! Because you ca n't compromise an artist 's vision !
REVEREND LEMON: B-but it 's our money

SAM: You 're givin ' me nightmares .
MIKE: Nightmares are cool .
SAM: U.P.S . brought this to the station . Sam hands Mike a small package .

BRET: Hang on , babydoll !
ASHLEY: Oh shit .
SAM: Hang on .
MIKE: Why ?
BRET: There is something very sexy about an older woman in uniform .
LARRY: Her nine-millimeter gives me a stiffy .
ASHLEY: Do n't antagonize her , you guys .
SAM: I told you not to act like kamikazes . Especially with Ashley iding behind . That is unacceptable , Bret .
BRET: I could always ride her from ehind . Larry snickers . Sam steels her rage .
SAM: You just bought yourself a eckless . Sam begins to write up the ticket .
ASHLEY: Ca n't you give 'em a break ?
SAM: Get in the car , Ashley . Now .
ASHLEY: But , Mom !
BRET: No sweat , babydoll . We 'll hook up later .

LARRY: Your Dad is the Mayor .
BRET: Oh , yeah . He signs your paycheck .
SAM: The next time you put my daughter 's life in danger , I 'll show you exactly how little that means to me . Bret and Larry feel her resolve .

SAM: I want both wheels on the ground .
MIKE: I read her her rights .
SAM: I can always count on you , Mike . Sam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town .
ASHLEY: Do you get off on humiliating me ?
SAM: This bad girl act does n't suit you , Ash .
ASHLEY: I 'm just trying to have fun . Do n't you remember what it 's like to grow up here ?
SAM: That 's what scares me .
SAM: I told you to keep this with you . Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack .
ASHLEY: You are so over protective .
SAM: A mother 's job is to protect he children .
ASHLEY: You need to start trusting me .
SAM: I 'd like to . But you keep skipping classes to go to the dunes with Bret .
ASHLEY: Why do you hate him so much ?
SAM: I do n't hate him . I just want you to have a future . I thought you wanted to get out of town . Go to med school .
ASHLEY: Maybe I want to stay . I could get pregnant by nineteen . Then divorce with a couple of kids I ca n't handle . Slap on a badge and e a trailer trash sheriff .
SAM: Thanks for the flashback .
CHRIS: Oh , great .
WADE: With one phone call I could put together a deal that would make us all very rich .
HARLAN: They say money does n't buy happiness .
WADE: They probably do n't have any .
FLOYD: Yeah , of boredom .
WADE: Think about it , Harlan , you could uy a commercial transmitter and start broadcasting to a national audience .
HARLAN: It would be nice to get the message out . Let people know the aliens walk among us .
SAM: Uh-oh . Sam flips on the SIREN and accelerates .
WADE: those McCormicks are just plain-old dumb .
CHRIS: I 've warned you not to talk about my family !
HARLAN: We have a surprise guest in the studio .
CHRIS: My family built this town !
WADE: Am I supposed to be grateful ?
SAM: That 's enough !
CHRIS: Stay out of this , Sam ! She manhandles Chris toward the door .
SAM: I heard .
WADE: I want him locked up !
SAM: Let 's all calm down .
WADE: We have no economy ! People are arely scraping by ! And now we 've een offered the deal of a lifetime . You do n't have the ight to stand in our way !
CHRIS: Those mines are full of gas . One spark in the wrong place could low this entire valley sky high . Do you really want to load that gun with toxic waste ?
WADE: Chem-Tech did seismic analysis , vapor checks , groundwater reads , soil sampling . They found isolated methane pockets , but no enzene or hydrogen sulfide .
CHRIS: How could they run tests ? I did n't give them permission to go into the mines . Wade retreats toward his shiny new Hummer .
WADE: I 'm greedy ? ! You 're the one keeping us down so you can search for gold !
SAM: Do n't take another step . Chris stares at her .
CHRIS: You 're taking his side ?
SAM: I 'm trying to keep the peace .
WADE: You 're crazy ! Just like you father !
CHRIS: He was n't crazy .
SAM: It 's okay .
ASHLEY: Maybe you 're not gay after all .
SAM: What are you talking about ?
ASHLEY: You ca n't take your eyes off his utt .
SAM: Where did you learn that it 's okay to talk to me like this ?
ASHLEY: Relax , Mom . He 's hot for an old guy . I can admit it . Why ca n't you ?
GLADYS: Did you pop him one ?
CHRIS: He had it comin ' . But Sam Palmer That woman abuses he power .
GLADYS: Why ? Because she stopped you from givin ' Wade another pop ?
CHRIS: I 'm not proud of it .
CHRIS: I thought you were trying the patch .
GLADYS: I am .
CHRIS: That burner 's on the fritz again .
GLADYS: Oh something 's broken ? What else is new ? You need to pay these by the end of the month .
CHRIS: Today For a split second I actually thought I had it .
GLADYS: Another vein of iron pyrite ?
CHRIS: Yeah Then a rat stole my lunch . I practically blew myself up trying to get it back .
GLADYS: I 'm glad you like my bologna sandwiches . Maybe you should talk to Wade .
CHRIS: What are you saying ?
GLADYS: Honey , if he really does have a uyer
CHRIS: You of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mothe lode .
GLADYS: Your daddy wanted to get rich . I do n't think he cared how that happened . If he was still alive , maybe he 'd sell those mines . Chris takes umbrage
CHRIS: And maybe you did n't know him so well after all . A tense beat .
GLADYS: You 're right I 'm just worried about how we 're going to pay these ills .
CHRIS: Do n't give up on me , Gladys . I promised him I 'd find the gold . And I will .
JOSHUA: An exponential growth rate That 's impossible .
CHARLIE: Me so horny . Me love you long time .
JOSHUA: Be quiet , bird !
CHARLIE: Charlie 's in the wire ! Incoming ! Something yanks the parrot O.S .
JOSHUA: Stop screwing around !
JOSHUA: Charlie Semper fidelis .
SAM: Work it , babe .
MIKE: What 's your excuse ! ?
SAM: You still want a ride , Mike ?
MIKE: I 'm just going to the mall .
SAM: Have fun .
SAM: Now what ? Ashley just screams .
EMMA: Why do you need to do that as six in the morning ! ? Do you hate me that much ! ?
HANK: I want to finish before I go to work .
EMMA: You 've been saying that for six months !
HANK: I ca n't finish if you keep interrupting !
EMMA: Have you seen Zeke this morning ?
HANK: He was chasing something earlier .
EMMA: If he got into the wall again , it 's your balls in the blender .
HANK: Hey , Zeke . Breakfast is ready .
EMMA: I 'll get the tuna .
HANK: Zeke ?
EMMA: What 's wrong with him ?
HANK: I 've got him by the tail .
NORMAN: Hey , dude . Yeah . You . Mike comes over to this goatee 'd rascal .
MIKE: A pack of cigarettes ?
NORMAN: Smoke to get high , not to die . My stuff is hydroponically grown in a top secret location . No artificial flavors . No preservatives . Just 110 percent homegrown .
MIKE: Where 's this secret location ?
NORMAN: I could have a dime bag for you toot sweet . But if I tell you where exactly , I 'd have to kill you .
MIKE: Norman , you know my mom 's the sheriff .
NORMAN: Oh yeah Right on Does she get high ?
CLERK: The bug spray is on aisle five !

OLD LADY: Excuse me , young man . Where can I find the bug spray ?
CLERK: Aisle five ! The Clerk grabs the PA 's microphone .
CLERK: All bug spray , rodent traps , ant poison and fly paper is on aisle five ! He returns his attention to Mike .
MIKE: Where 's aisle five ?
MIKE: Animal tracks . Definitely too big to be spiders . Could be rats .
CHRIS: What am I , the Pied Piper
FLOYD: I 'm sorry . I have n't seen him .
SAM: Quiet ! Quiet please ! The mob is not listening .
BEVERLY: They were clogging up my house !
EMMA: I want to know what killed Zeke !
TRAVIS: He was a good dog ! He would n't just get up and go !
SAM: I had spiders at my house too . We need an exterminator not a sheriff .
TRAVIS: What about my dog ?
SAM: I do n't know , Travis . We 're gon na keep an eye out . But we 're not gettin ' anywhere like this . You should go back out there and look for your animals . If they have n't shown up by tonight . I 'll call Fish and Game . Okay ?
MIKE: Mom ! Mom ! All Josh 's spiders are gone !
SAM: I ca n't do this right now , Mike ! Everyone 's having pest problems !
MIKE: But Joshua is gone !
SAM: Maybe he 's out looking for his spiders ?
MIKE: Mom , I 'm serious ! You 're not listening !
SAM: Mike I 've got missing pets . Spiders in the plumbing . Rats and mice coming out of basements . And your sister 's about to end up on a milk carton . I ca n't have you losing The PHONE RINGS . Sam answers it .
WADE: Came out to feed my birds this morning .
SAM: Coyotes ?
WADE: Hell no !
SAM: All this happened last night ?
WADE: I guess . And we did n't hear a thing . Sam gestures toward the BARKING DOG .
SAM: What about him ?
WADE: Not a peep .
SAM: How 's the ostrich business ?
WADE: Not so good lately .
SAM: You 've got that new Hummer . You must be makin ' enough to pay fo it .
WADE: You like it ? I 'll take you for a ide .

WADE: I did n't kill my birds , Sam . Is that what you think ?
MIKE: I 've found more tracks . Even larger now .
WADE: Now you 're on the job ? ! What the hell were you doin ' last night ? !
SAM: Come on , Mike . Let 's hit it .
WADE: I need to know what happened to my irds !
SAM: If I find anything I 'll let you know . So you can fill out that insurance form .
MIKE: We have to go back .
SAM: Mike ?
MIKE: That was a trapdoor spider 's urrow .
SAM: What are you talking about ?
MIKE: Joshua was feeding his spiders ugs from the creek . And they were getting bigger .
SAM: Have you been overdosing you Ritalin ? She checks him for a fever .
MIKE: Maybe I am losing it He checks himself for a fever .
ASHLEY: Woo-hoo !
BRET: No such thing . Norman 's bud is da'kine . He coughs and they both laugh .
ASHLEY: I do n't know . I want to do something with my life , Bret . Help people . Maybe med school is still an option .
BRET: Not if you keep hanging out with me .
ASHLEY: Thanks , Mom .
BRET: I thought you loved me .
ASHLEY: I do !
BRET: Then what 's the problem ? You want to leave town . You do n't want to make out .

RANDY: The only one coming is you , dude .
BRET: Ride !
PIG PEN: I will live every moment of my life as if it were my last .
MIKE: Hello ? Hello ? The line is dead .
WAITRESS: The phones went down for some eason . Maybe that 's why Bret did n't call . Did you want to go ahead and order ?
WADE: Just give me the usual .
WAITRESS: One ostrich steak , comin ' up . Wade reacts glumly to the word `` ostrich . ''

CHRIS: On a date ? Sam freezes for a second . Chris laughs .
CHRIS: I 'm kidding . What did you want to ask ?
SAM: Have you noticed anything strange in the mines ?
CHRIS: Define strange .
SAM: I had spiders in my house . Hecto had roaches in his basement . Some mice
CHRIS: How about stampeding rats ?
SAM: Were they running away from something ?
CHRIS: Could have been . Never saw them do that before . I guess it qualifies as strange . Sam thinks this over .
SAM: Are you asking me out on a date ?
CHRIS: Only if you 're going to say yes . Sam smiles slightly .
CHRIS: So that 's a 'No . '
SAM: My kids are the world to me , Chris . When their dad left it eally took a toll . On all of us . I ca n't go through that again . I wo n't .

ASHLEY: No .
SAM: Then why is his truck out front ?
ASHLEY: Do n't worry about it .
SAM: What do you mean ? What happened ?
ASHLEY: Nothing .
MIKE: Spiders shed their skins when they grow . Chris looks at Mike for a moment .
CHRIS: Gladys is dead . Chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle .
MIKE: Maybe not . That got Chris 's attention .
CHRIS: It 's a little large .
MIKE: See ! Male tarantulas wrap thei prey in webbing . Tight like a mummy . The food stays alive so they can eat it later . Sam enters the room in time to overhear this .
SAM: Mike , please . Now is n't the time . Chris looks up at Sam .
CHRIS: They keep their food alive .
SAM: What is this ?
MIKE: A spider 's leg !
SAM: No . That 's a piece of cactus . Look It 's covered with spines .
MIKE: Those are quills ! Tarantulas can flick them at you like darts !
SAM: Giant tarantulas ?
MIKE: Tarantulas ! Wolfs ! Trapdoors ! Joshua had a ton of exotics !
CHRIS: If there were giant spiders oaming the desert , do n't you think somebody would 've seen them y now ?
MIKE: The jumpers hunt in daylight . But not the others . They only come out when the sun goes down !
SAM: I guess I should watch more 'Oprah . ' It must be a textbook 'no-dad ' kind of thing .
CHRIS: That one looks kind of scratchy .
SAM: All Jason cared about was getting out and starting over . I guess that included buying a new wardrobe .
CHRIS: Gladys thought I should sell ut you know I never wanted to get rich . If it was about the money , I would have sold out to Wade a long time ago .
SAM: I 'm sorry , Chris .
CHRIS: Do you know what I 'm trying to say ?
SAM: It was n't about spending the gold , it was about finding it .
CHRIS: That 's right . That 's exactly ight .
SAM: They look great .
MIKE: Ca n't you turn that down ? !
ASHLEY: Spider Mike Spider
MIKE: Wow ! A scytodes spitter !

MIKE: The scytodes spits a gooey discharge to immobilize thei prey .
ASHLEY: No shit !
MIKE: Watch its fangs ! The spitter 's fangs move from side to side as it fires !
CHRIS: I 'll keep that in mind .
MIKE: Get under it ! Stab it in the abdomen ! They do n't have any armor down there !
CHRIS: How am I supposed to do that ! ?
SAM: Ever used one of these ?
CHRIS: I 'm a fast learner .
MIKE: I told you ! I told you all ! But nobody ever listens to Mike ! Still think I 'm crazy , Mom ?
SAM: I 'm sorry I did n't believe you . Ashley is about to hyperventilate .
ASHLEY: There are n't enough wine coolers in the world to calm me down !
SAM: I wo n't let anything happen to you . Sam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun .
CHRIS: What other spiders did Joshua have ?
MIKE: Spitters , jumpers , orb weavers , tarantulas
CHRIS: Why could n't he keep goldfish like a normal person ? Sam checks the phone . It 's dead .
SAM: We need to warn people .
CHRIS: How about the radio station ?
SAM: Good one . We 'll go to Harlan 's .
ASHLEY: Outside ? You want to go outside ?
SAM: It 's okay
HARLAN: I 'm saying the invasion has already occurred . The aliens are among us . But they 've taken common forms . They hide in plain sight .
SAM: We need to make an emergency oadcast .
HARLAN: What happened ?
MIKE: Giant spider invasion .
CHRIS: What are you going to say ? You ca n't tell them the truth .
SAM: Is this thing on ? Hello ? This is Sam Palmer . We have an emergency situation .
CHRIS: The mall ?
SAM: The walls are concrete and the exits have steel gates . We could hold an entire army of giant spiders from inside .
ASHLEY: You just said giant spider on the air . Sam sees the microphone is keyed .
HARLAN: Now that 's great radio !
SAM: Not giant spiders ! I meant to say
HARLAN: The aliens !
MIKE: Wait , Mom ! The noise will attract more of them !
CHRIS: Let 's try for the mall . Sam leads the others toward town .
SAM: Your keys ?
CHRIS: In my other pants .
MIKE: Look out !
HARLAN: Stop ! Take us with you !
WADE: No ! Please !

ASHLEY: He was out at the dunes .
SAM: Go ahead . I 've got your butt .
CHRIS: What ?
SAM: Your back ! I 've got your back !
MIKE: Trapdoors ! They 're all around us !
SAM: How can we spot them ? Mike consults his Cassiopeia .
MIKE: I did n't download that part !
ASHLEY: You dork !
TRAVIS: Help me please He is dragged back underground .
CHRIS: Keep going !
ASHLEY: There 's someone inside !
NORMAN: We 're closed .

SAM: The gates ! Close the gates !
ASHLEY: Mom !
MIKE: Hurry up !
SAM: Shut the other entrances !
NORMAN: Trick or treat .
CHRIS: We 're sealed up at both ends .
SAM: You pump the slide to jack in a fresh round . Point at your target and squeeze .
WADE: Watch it !
CHRIS: Like that ?
SAM: Try not to cut yourself .
WADE: Why did n't we see them earlier ?
MIKE: For the last time ! They ca n't handle the sunlight . They were waiting in the mines for the sun to go down !
CHRIS: Then at daybreak they 'll go back inside . We can walk out the front door .
MIKE: We wo n't make it that long .
ASHLEY: They 're gon na come in after us ?
MIKE: They 're growing very fast . They need food to sustain that kind of development .
HANK: Someone should go out and get help .
EMMA: You go , Sam .
SAM: Me ?
WADE: You 're the sheriff .
SAM: I do n't have that many handcuffs .
PETE: What about the police radio ?
SAM: You 're not goin ' back out there , Pete . None of us are .
CHRIS: Radio Shack is full of cell phones .
WADE: But the signal wo n't get out of the valley . That 's why we could n't sell any of the damn things .
HARLAN: My antenna
WADE: Great idea . You should do that .
CHRIS: I 'll cover you , Harlan .
SAM: Are you sure you can handle this ?
CHRIS: While I 'm gone , do you think you could find me a size 32 ?
SAM: I 'll do my best . Uhh Do you want to go out sometime ? Dinner ? Maybe a movie ?
WADE: Hey , loverboy you 've got a town to save .
ASHLEY: You 're not really going to get him igger pants are you ?
SAM: No way .
CHRIS: Do n't even think about locking this door .
WADE: I 'll be right here waiting . Wade slowly opens the roof door .
CHRIS: It looks clear .
ASHLEY: I did n't know you wore cologne .
MIKE: I do n't . It 's spider repellent . Sam steps in through the door .
SAM: Let 's stay together , guys .
ASHLEY: Can I get this ?
SAM: Move it !
CHRIS: We 've got company !
HARLAN: I 've got a signal ! He dials 911 .
CHRIS: They 're coming !
HARLAN: I 'm calling from Prosperity Nevada ! We 're being attacked by giant spiders ! The entire town has been overrun ! Chris yells up to him .
CHRIS: No ! Do n't say that !

MIKE: Arac attack !
SAM: Did you get help ? ! Is anybody coming ! ?
CHRIS: We 're on our own !
ASHLEY: I ca n't stay in here !
MIKE: They 're trapping us like ants in a log ! Once they have all the exits locked , they 'll come in through the last one !
ASHLEY: Here !
HANK: It 's tool time !
MIKE: Where do you grow your weed ? !
NORMAN: Dude , if I tell you , I have to kill you . Norman takes a hit on his reefer .
MIKE: They 're going to kill us , you stoner ! Norman sees the army of spiders closing in .
NORMAN: Over here !
WADE: Where are you taking us ?
NORMAN: To Shangri-la .
SAM: Not today .
WADE: Oh great ! Now you 've trapped us ! Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs .
CHRIS: We should be able to hold them off for a little while .
ASHLEY: They 're coming through the wall !
CHRIS: What the hell ?
BRET: I did n't touch her ! I swear ! Sam looks at Ashley .
ASHLEY: Do n't waste your bullets . Wade embraces his son .
WADE: I thought you were a goner , boy !
CHRIS: We can get out this way !
ASHLEY: Are n't the spiders in there ?
MIKE: Not until daylight .
BRET: You 're going back in there ? ! Are you all crazy ! ?
WADE: Come on , Bret !
BRET: No way ! I 'm not going !
CHRIS: Cover me !
SAM: What are you going to do ? !
WADE: We 're trapped again !
CHRIS: At least they ca n't follow us .
SAM: Which way do we go ?
CHRIS: I think we 're in one of the old tunnels .
SAM: Can you get us out of here ?
CHRIS: Do n't worry , Sam .
MIKE: I 've seen one of these before !
ASHLEY: What are they ?
CHRIS: Toxic waste .
SAM: Where did you see it , Mike ?
MIKE: The creek where Joshua gets his spider food . There was one in the water . Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel .
CHRIS: We can get out this way !
BRET: No , we ca n't . Is n't that tunnel blocked off , Dad ? Chris and the others look at Wade .
WADE: Uh yeah he 's right . We ca n't get out that way .
CHRIS: You did this ?
WADE: I knew you 'd never sell We 're under my property so
SAM: You put all of us at risk .
WADE: I did n't have a choice ! I was oke ! They gave me a hundred grand !
SAM: I think our lives are worth a little more than that .
CHRIS: We 're wasting time .
WADE: My birds ! You see , Sam ? I was n't lying ! That 's what I can put on the insurance form giant spiders !
ASHLEY: Ewww what 's that smell ? The others are reacting strongly .
CHRIS: Methane . This cavern is full of gas .
ASHLEY: What does that mean ?
CHRIS: One spark and we 're all dead . Norman swallows his glowing joint .
MIKE: That 's what I was talking about , Chris . Presents from the male tarantula to the female .
BRET: So the female 's around here ? Bret looks around nervously .
SAM: That one just moved !
CHRIS: There 's somebody in here !
ASHLEY: Her breathing is shallow . She 's going into arrest .
CHRIS: It 's okay . It 's okay .
GLADYS: Am I dead ?
CHRIS: You 're okay .
GLADYS: I 'm not in heaven ?
CHRIS: No
GLADYS: Then what 's with all the gold ?
WADE: Gold ! Gold ! Look ! It 's everywhere !

GLADYS: So were you .
WADE: Get as much as you can ! Bret looks at Ashley .
BRET: Nice work , Doc .
SAM: You saved my life . Ashley smiles . Gladys leans over to Norman .
GLADYS: Have you got a smoke , kid ?
NORMAN: The man says this cavern is full of highly flammable methane gas . I smoke to get high , not to die .
SAM: Spiders !
NORMAN: What 's the big deal ?
MIKE: I think you should stop .
NORMAN: Why ?
MIKE: They do n't have hair . They are n't fully grown tarantulas . Chris and Sam look over .
MIKE: They 're giant babies !
CHRIS: Consuela ?

TRACY: Thanks , Mr. M .
PAUL: Stop daydreaming ! Get back to work !
JIM: C'mon , wolverines ! Defense ! Let 's hold 'em back !
DEREK: Uh , ethics is like when you , uh , do what society tells you is right and morals are like , uh
JIM: You 're on the right track , who can help him out ?
DEREK: ..morals are when
JIM: Michelle ?
MICHELLE: Morals are like lessons , you know , like the moral of a story ; it 's what you learn from a story or a fable o something . . .
JIM: Or a life experience . Good . And ethics ?
MICHELLE: That 's more like , urn Ethics is how you use the morals that you learn from a story ?
JIM: Okay . But we 're still missing something key here . What are we missing ?
TRACY: I know .
JIM: Tracy .
TRACY: Ethics are
LARRY FOUCH: Yeah , no , I know , Tracy . That 's why we 're Look , can we just take a vote on this ?
TRACY: the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a
DAVE: Her pussy gets so wet you ca n't believe it .
JIM: Do n't tell me that . I do n't want to know that .
DAVE: She 's incredible . Everything just gets soaked .
TRACY: what ?
DAVE: Well , I notice you do n't seem to have any close friends at Millard . You seem to be kind of a loner .
TRACY: No , I 'm not . I 'm just really busy .
DAVE: I know . I know its not by choice . I just mean , well , being the kind of person you are , it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to .
TRACY: What do you mean ? What kind of person am I ?
DAVE: What kind of person ?
TRACY: Thank you .
DAVE: And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness , and that price is loneliness .
JIM: You did it at your house ? Your own house ?
DAVE: Look , Jim Okay . I know it all seems crazy , and maybe it did start out , you know , for the for the sex and the danger . But now it 's different . Jim , what I 'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally , totally in love .
JIM: In love ?
DAVE: Yeah , it 's serious . I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has . She even wants to read my novel .
JIM: But you have n't written your novel .
DAVE: That 's the whole point . It 's all in my head ; it 's right here . I just got to get it out there . Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it . It 's eautiful .
JIM: Dave , I 'm just saying this as you friend . What you 're doing is really , eally wrong , and you 've got to stop .
DAVE: You 're not just jealous , are you ? I mean , we both used to talk about he
JIM: That was just talk ! Fantasy talk ! What are you , nuts ? We talk about girls all the time , but it does n't mean anything . I would never . . . I mean , I take very seriously our strict moral code . The line you 've crossed is it 's illegal and it 's immoral .
DAVE: I do n't need a lecture on ethics , Jim , okay ? I know what
JIM: I 'm not talking about ethics . I 'm talking about morals .
DAVE: Look , I appreciate your concern . I eally do . But like I said , I got it under control .
JIM: sits on the vinyl sofa .
DAVE: Tracy 's Mom she does n't understand .
WALT: No , I 'd say she does n't . I do n't think I 've ever seen a mother quite so upset . We 're all very , very lucky she does n't want this public .
DAVE: But we 're in love
WALT: Dave . Dave , look at me
SHERRY: Your novel ? Are you fucking kidding me ?
DAVE: Sherry Sherry Sheerrry .
TRACY: certain time in history and
JIM: Okay . We 'll pick up here next time
TRACY: One per person ! Put those back I
DOUG SCHENKEN: Eat me
TRACY: Ninety-seven.. .ninety-eight .
TRACY: I got all my signatures . One hundred and fifty-eight way more than I need !
JIM: Hey , that 's supe
TRACY: Here they are .
JIM: You can put those in my box . I 'll look at them tomorrow .
TRACY: Could you approve them now ? I 'd like to kick off my campaign right away , you know , in the morning .
JIM: Right
TRACY: Are n't you supposed to keep them ?
JIM: NO , that 's fine
TRACY: I thought you were supposed to keep them .
JIM: Okay , fine . Sure
TRACY: Thanks for everything .
JIM: You bet .
TRACY: I ca n't wait to start campaigning .
JIM: Should be easy . So far no competition .
TRACY: Hell , you know , Coca-Cola 's the world 's number one soft drink , but they spend more money than anybody on advertising . I guess that 's how come they stay numbe one .
JIM: Yeah . Okay . well , good luck Tracy
TRACY: You know , Mr. M. , when I win the presidency , that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year . And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive . Would n't you ?
JIM: Sure
TRACY: Okay . That 's good . I just wanted to make sure .
JIM: Good luck , Tracy .
DIANE: Anything wrong ?
JIM: Everything 's fine . Just , you know , school .
TRACY'S VOICE: You know , Coca-Cola 's by far the number one soft drink When I win the presidency we 're going to be spending a lot of time together a lot of time lots and lots and lots of time president and advisor . . .
TRACY: harmonious and productive close and special you and I so close so intimate together
JIM: Paul .
PAUL: Why . . . ? Why . . . ?
JIM: Paul , could I talk to you for a minute ?
PAUL: I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it . And maybe go on to
JIM: I know . I understand disappointment . I really do .
PAUL: Yeah .
JIM: But you 've got a big choice right now . You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life . Or you can choose to see it for what it really is an opportunity . I personally think you have a big future ahead of you , and I do n't mean the fleeting glory of sports .
PAUL: What do you mean ?
JIM: Let me give you a clue . You 're a born leader . You 're one of the most popula students at Millard . You 're honest and straightforward . You do n't choke unde pressure , as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside . The other kids look up to you . What does that spell ?
PAUL: Who , me ? Nooo . I never I do n't know anything about that stuff , Mr. M. Besides , that 's Tracy Flick 's thing . She 's always working so hard and
JIM: Yeah , no , she 's a go-getter , all right .
PAUL: And she 's super-nice
JIM: Yeah . But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy , does n't it ? That 's more like a well , like a dictatorship , like we studied .
PAUL: Huh ? Oh . Uh pears
JIM: takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard .
PAUL: No , wait apples . Apples .
JIM: Fine . Let 's say all you ever knew was apples . Apples , apples and more apples . You might think apples were pretty good , even if you occasionally got a rotten one . Then one day there 's an orange . And now you can make a decision . Do you want an apple , or do you want an orange ? That 's democracy .
PAUL: I also like bananas .
JIM: Exactly . So what do you say ? Maybe it 's time to give a little something ack .
TRACY: The right side is too high . The right side . Just a smidge .
GUY: Hey Paul , you going over to Anthony 's on Friday , or what did you decide ?
PAUL: I got ta talk to him first .
TRACY: Who put you up to this ?
PAUL: Huh ? Oh , hi , Tracy
TRACY: Who put you up to this ?
PAUL: What do you mean ?
TRACY: You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president ?
PAUL: No . Uh I just you know , I just thought
TRACY: Thought what ?
PAUL: Well , see , I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything and how I still want to , you know , do something for the school and
TRACY: So Mr. McAllister asked you to run .
PAUL: Well , I mean , you know , I talked to him and everything , but he just said he thought it was a good idea and how there 's all different kinds of fruit and It 's nothing against you , Tracy . You 're the best . I just thought
TRACY: Okay , Mr. Popular . You 're on .
PAUL: Paul Paul power Paul Paul for President progress promise peanut Paul-i-tics yeah President Paul Punt for Paul ! No .
TAMMY: What ?
LISA: I told you I ca n't . I just It does n't feel right anymore , you know ?

TAMMY: What ?
LISA: I 'm not a dyke , okay , and we 're not in love . We were just I was just experimenting .

LISA: Are you crazy ?
TAMMY: What ?
LISA: People can see this .
TAMMY: So ?
LISA: These are private these are for us .

DIANE: You guys have fun ?
JIM: Yeah . No . I mean , you know .
DIANE: What ?
JIM: Well , Sherry 's great . But she can be a little much sometimes .
DIANE: Oh , Jim ! Oh , God !
PAUL: Tammy ? Tammy , what are you doing ?
TRACY: You 're the advisor . You should stop her . She 's not qualified . She 's just a sophomore .
JIM: Calm down , Tracy . Just calm down .
TRACY: Are you sure all her signatures are eal ? It 's not easy to get all those signatures .
JIM: As far as I know , they
PAUL: We ca n't both run , can we ? We 're other and sister . Can we ?
LISA: It 's a conflict of interest . And Paul was first .
JIM: Anyone who gets signatures in on time can run . And she got in just under the wire . Nothing I can do .
TRACY: Let me see them . Let me see them
JIM: Looks like Tim Kobza .
LISA: She 's doing this to get back at me
PAUL: For what ?
LISA: I mean at you .
PAUL: For what ?
LISA: I do n't know . You 're her brother you should know .
TRACY: Tim Kobza ? Tim Kobza ! Who 's he ? I 've never heard of him !
JIM: Look , why do n't we just forget about Tammy ? We 'll have the assembly tomorrow , everybody 'll make thei speeches , and I 'm sure everything will e fine .
JERRY: I love Millard High , and I will be a dedicated vice President . A vote fo Jerry Slavin is a vote for good government . And even if I ca n't really stand up for you , I will . Thank you .
JIM: Thank you , Jerry , and good luck . Again , Jerry is running unopposed for Vice President . So we 'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates unning . The first in alphabetical orde is Tracy Flick .
TRACY: Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote , `` I can not make my days longer , so I strive to make them better . '' With this election , we here at Millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better . During this campaign I have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns . I spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez , who told me how alienated she feels from he own homeroom . I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks , who said his mother works in a cafeteria and ca n't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes . I wo n't bore you with long- winded promises about all the new and innovative things I will definitely achieve during the year in which it will e my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you , but I can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess ; commitment -
DOUG SCHENKEN: Eat me
DOUG'S BUDDY: Eat me raw !
WALT: If you ca n't be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve , then you do n't deserve to be called adults but children* Because that 's what children are . And you 'll be treated like children . So let 's all listen up .
TRACY: The three most important attributes the president needs to possess are commitment , qualifications , and experience . I 'll add one more ; caring . I care about Millard , and I care about each and every one of you , and togethe we can all make a difference . One of the things I would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at Millard . I and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff , so a continuous dialogue would exist .
WALT: I 'd say she knows a thing or two about student-faculty dialogue .
TRACY: When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick next week , you wo n't just be voting fo me . You 'll be voting for yourself and for every other student Our days wo n't e any longer , but they can sure be etter . Thank you .
JIM: The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzier . Paul ?
PAUL: As many of you know I broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what I want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it 's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is ou school everything it could be I want ou school to reach its true potential that is why I am running for president .
JIM: Okay , Paul . Now our final candidate fo President - another one of the Metzie clan sophomore Tammy Metzier .
WALT: People . People I
TAMMY: Who cares about this stupid election ?
STUDENTS: Tammy ! Tammy ! Tammy !
TAMMY: 0h do n't vote for me I Who cares ? Do n't vote at all !
WALT: That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election . Getting everybody all riled up like that . She 's finished , you hear me ? Washed up .
JIM: Walt , we ca n't throw her out of the election just because we do n't like he speech . That 's not what student government 's about .
WALT: Yeah whatever . All I know is she 's a troublemaker . She 's on my list .
RON: All we need to do is send a message , so maybe we should just suspend her .
WALT: Right . That 's it . She 's suspended fo a week !
JIM: I think that 's a little strong Walt . Ron ?
RON: We do n't want to make a martyr out of her . Three days sounds right to me .
WALT: Okay . Three days . Take care of it .
DUDE: Here you go .
TAMMY: Hey I said lights I
PAUL: Oh . Hi , Tammy . I was just , you know , I went to all your teachers and got you assignments .
TAMMY: Okay , Paul . Thanks . Thanks a lot .
PAUL: Yeah . Oh , one more thing . Tammy . You know , all this election stuff . 'Cause , you know , everyone is saying it 's so weird that you 're running against me , and , well , it is kind of weird , and you have n't really told me why you 're doing it and did n't tell me in advance o anything . But that 's okay , you know . l espect your privacy . I just want you to know that no matter who wins , if it 's you or me , there 's no hard feelings . We 're still brother and sister . Okay ? Cause and I hope you feel the same .
TAMMY: Sure , Paul . No hard feelings .
PAUL: Okay . Great . I feel good .
TRACY: Eric , the `` r '' is supposed to be green , not blue .
ERIC: Oh . Okay .
TRACY: That 's okay . I 'm too busy .
TRACY: Let 's see `` save '' is Command `` S. '' Okay .
TRACY: I did n't do this . I did n't do it .
JIM: There 's your culprit
SHERRY: Dave .
JIM: No , I uh , did n't know that
SHERRY: All his life . He 's tried everything .
JIM: Still clear ?
SHERRY: Yep .
JIM: We 'll let it run awhile
SHERRY: This one 's clean .
JIM: Right now ?
SHERRY: Easy , tiger . Come by after school . I 'll leave Darryl with the sitter .
JIM: Three twenty-five .
SHERRY: Three twenty-five .
LISA: It 's not fair . It 's not fai
PAUL: I just do n't think anybody would do something like that on purpose . It must have been some kind of mistake . Like a maintenance thing .
WALT: Jim , where the hell have you been ?
JIM: Nowhere . I do n't have class until second period .
WALT: Even tried you at home . We 've got a situation here .
LISA: If Paul loses tomorrow , it 's not fair . There has to be another election , with posters .
JIM: What 's the problem ?
LISA: Did n't you see ?
WALT: Somebody tore down their posters .
LISA: Those posters cost a lot of money we do n't have I There 's no time to make any more posters , there 's no
WALT: We 'll get to the bottom of it .
PAUL: We still have some extra ones , do n't we ? Maybe we can just
LISA: It was Tammy I That 's who it was .
PAUL: Oh , no , hey . Like I said . Tammy would n't she
WALT: Well , that speech she gave it was pretty , you know , pretty out there . But we 'll get to the bottom of it . Do n't you worry . Mr. McAllister is going to see to that . Right , Jim ?
JIM: Oh yeah , you bet .
LISA: She should be expelled . Or worse !
WALT: You two just go back and focus on you studies . Mr. McAllister 's going to handle this .
MR. BECKMAN: Tracy ?
JIM: is inside .
TRACY: If it 's about the posters , I think it 's so awful . It 's a travesty .
JIM: A travesty . Huh . That 's interesting , ecause I think you did it .
TRACY: Wait - are you accusing me ? You 're not serious . I ca n't Mr. McAllister , we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and I mean , I ca n't believe it . I 'm I 'm shocked !
JIM: Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend ?
TRACY: I was . So ? Mr. Pecharda let me in . As you know , with all my esponsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so . But I left very early , around 6 30 .
JIM: 6 30 . How do you know what time the posters were torn down ?
TRACY: I do n't . I just know they were there when I left . I 'm giving you helpful information is all . You know , instead of wasting time interrogating me , we should be out there trying to find out who did this .
JIM: Okay , Tracy , so who do you think did it ? Whom should we `` interrogate ? ''
TRACY: well , I do n't know . It could have been anybody . There are a lot of , you know , subversive elements around Millard . You know , like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs . Or Doug Schenken - what about him ? Or what about Tammy Metzier ? Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that .
JIM: You 're a very intelligent girl , Tracy . You have many admirable qualities . But someday maybe you 'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead , and yes , stepping on people to get there , well , there 's a lot more to life than that . And in the end , you 're only cheating yourself .
TRACY: Why are you lecturing me ?
JIM: This is n't the time or the place to get into it , but there is , for just one example , a certain former colleague of mine , who made a very big mistake , a life mistake . I think the lesson there is that , old and young , we ail make mistakes , and we have to learn that ou actions , all of them , can carry serious consequences . You 're very young , Tracy underage , in fact but maybe one day you 'll understand .
TRACY: I do n't know what you 're referring to , ut I do know that if certain older and wiser people had n't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy , everything would be okay .
JIM: I agree . But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very , very grateful the whole school did n't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations , and chances to win certain elections .
TRACY: And I think certain older persons like you and your `` colleague '' should n't be leaching after their students , especially when some of them ca n't even get their own wives pregnant . And they certainly should n't be running around making slanderous accusations . Especially when certain young , naive people 's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city 's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits . And if you want to keep questioning me like this , I wo n't continue without my attorney present .
JIM: Okay , Tracy . Have it your way .
TAMMY: You wanted to see me , Mr. M. ?
JIM: Just wait outside . Tammy .
TAMMY: Okay . But is this about the posters ?
JIM: Possibly . Please just wait outside .
TAMMY: Okay . Because I know who did it . So.. I 'll just be outside .
JIM: Tracy , do n't go away . Come in , Tammy .
TRACY: This ought to be good
JIM: So what do you have to tell me ?
TAMMY: Well , this is hard for me , but I think it 's important to be honest . Do n't you ?
JIM: What is it . Tammy ?
TAMMY: I 'm the one . I did it . I tore down Paul 's posters .
JIM: Looks at her skeptically does n't say a word .
TAMMY: This weekend .
JIM: Exactly when ?
TAMMY: I do n't know . Yesterday . Sunday .
JIM: And how did you get in the school ?
TAMMY: Door was open .
JIM: Which door ?
TAMMY: I do n't know . All I know is I did it I
JIM: I do n't believe you .
TAMMY: I have proof .
JIM: Final I do n't know what your problem is , but if that 's the way you want it , that 's the way it 'll be . I do n't have time . You 're out of the election , and I 'm turning you over to Dr. Hendricks .
TRACY: Yes ?
JIM: Looks like today 's your lucky day
TRACY: What do you mean ?
JIM: You 're off the hook . Tammy here has confessed .
TRACY: I told you ! I told you ! You 're going to pay for my banner !
JIM: That 's enough , Tracy . Quit while you 're ahead , okay ? I 'll handle this . Could you ask Walt to come in ?
JIM: Pop quiz , everybody
JIM: Okay , everybody , pass them forward . Stephanie , put down your pen .
EMPLOYEE: Nobody 's come in here looking fo anybody . Just you .
JIM: Are you sure ?
EMPLOYEE: You okay ?
JIM: Sherry , it 's me . Are you there ? Pick up . Okay , it 's 4 32 . I came by at 3 25 like we said and waited , but you were n't there . Anyway , I hope you 're okay I 'm worried about you . So now I 'm just at the at the place we talked about . Suite 219 . So I 'm here . Everything 's all set . You can just come over . Ca n't wait . Okay . Bye .
DICK METZIER: I do n't get it . What you have against your mother and me , against your brothe Paul , is completely beyond me . And you mother is extremely upset , she 's at the end of her rope . Your behavior gets crazier and crazier and wilder and wilder , and who knows what the hell else you 're doing out there that we do n't even know about ?
TAMMY: Dad , I
DICK: Do n't you smartass me ! Do n't you dare smartass me ! You just shut your mouth I Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks - we just got off the phone with him at home . You know , he does n't want you back at Millard . He 's fed up with you . Fed up ! And I do n't lame him !
JO: Dick Dick , ..
DICK: What ?
JO: Tammy , now we 've come to a decision . He just think it would be best
DICK: You 're going to Catholic school next year . You 're going to Sacred Heart . Maybe they 'll straighten you out !
JIM: Okay
TRACY: Dear Lord Jesus , I do not often speak with You and ask for things , but now I eally must insist that You help me win the election tomorrow , because I deserve it and Paul Metzier does n't , as You well know . l realize that it was Your divine hand that disqualified Tammy , and now I 'm asking that You go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office where I belong , so that I may carry out Your will on Earth as it is in Heaven . If elected I promise that I will pray more often . Okay ? Amen .
TRACY: Mom ?
MRS. FLICK: Hmmm ?
TRACY: I think I 'm going to lose today
MRS. FLICK: What are you talking about ? This time tomorrow , you 'll be president
TRACY: You really think so ?
MRS. FLICK: Tracy Flick 's a winner .
TRACY: Good morning , Mr. M .

JIM: Are you there ? Sherry , are you there ? It 's Jim . Why did you do that ? I trusted you . Completely . You 've ruined my life . Do you know that ? Do you realize that ? Huh ? Do you ? You 've ruined Diane 's life . You ruined my life . is that what you wanted ? I 'm sorry . It 's just I 'm going nuts here . Okay , all right , so Really , I 'm sorry . I just think we should talk , okay ? I love you .
SALESLADY: And Sacred Heart is such a good school . Excellent school . The public schools are going downhill , as far as I 'm concerned .
JO: Well , we 've had good luck at Millard , ut for this one it 's time for a change .
SALESLADY: So what do you think ? Sacred Heart has the prettiest . They have that nice hint of purple .

TEACHER: Hi , Tracy
TRACY: Tracy Enid Flick .
TEACHER: I know .
TRACY: Phil you ready ?
PHIL: Ready .
STUDENT: Come on , Tracy .
TRACY: Just wait .
PAUL: Way to go , Tracy ! Is n't this exciting ?
TRACY: Yeah .
PAUL: Hell , good luck !
TRACY: Good luck to you too , Paul .
PAUL: Thanks !
LARRY: Okay , Mr. M .
JIM: What ? Right . So let 's start counting .
LARRY: Well , I thought that well , the way it always works is that SGA president does a count , then the SGA advisor , you know , for the two independent counts .
JIM: Fine . So do your count . Start with president , and I 'll be right back .
LARRY: You have the key , Mr. McAllister .
JIM: Right . I know .
LARRY: Are you okay , Mr. M. ?
ANOTHER STUDENT: What happened to your eye ?
JIM: I 'm fine . It 's just a bee sting , a simple little everyday bee sting . Some people , they get stung , it 's no big deal . Me , I swell up . Okay ?
LARRY: Okay . Yeah . We know
JIM: All right . I 'll be back
SHERRY'S VOICE: Hi . You 've reached the Novotnys . We 're not around , but we 'll call you back real soon . Have a nice day .
JIM: You 're there .
PAUL: Hey , Mr. M. Big day , huh ?
JIM: What d'you got ?
LARRY: I 'm not supposed to tell . Not until you 've counted too . We 're each supposed to make an independent count .
JIM: You 're kidding , right ?
LARRY: I thought those were the rules , Mr. McAllister . If they 've changed in any way
JIM: Larry , we 're not electing the fucking Pope here . Just tell me who won .
LARRY: It 's a squeaker , Mr. M. I 've got Tracy y a vote . Just one vote .
JIM: Huh . Okay . Well , I guess I 'd bette do my count .
DALE: Sputnik .
MR. FLAGG: Right . And what year was that ?
DALE: 1958 ?
MR. FLAGG: Almost . 1957 . So the point here is when we found out about Sputnik , we got eally scared . It seemed like no matte what we had and kept secret , they could develop it too . A-bombs , h-bombs , ocket ships . And this time we were ehind them . So February 1961 , Kennedy tells Congress and the American people he wants to go to the moon . May 1961 , the Apollo program is announced
JIM: Larry ?
LARRY: Yeah ?
JIM: I think we 've got a problem .
WALT: 253 254 255 . I get the same as you Jim . Looks like Paul 's ou president .
LARRY: No way I It does n't make sense .
WALT: Sorry . My figures work out exactly the same as Jim 's . 256 for Paul , 255 fo Tracy .
LARRY: And 290 `` disregards , '' right ?
WALT: If you say so .
JIM: Mostly Tammy fans
LARRY: See , it does n't add up . There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted . Two votes are missing . Check the register .
JIM: He 's right . Two people must have pocketed their ballots . Usually it 's more .
LARRY: But , they were there I counted 803 votes .
JIM: It happens , Larry . People make mistakes .
LARRY: I did n't make a mistake . Every vote was there when you sac down
WALT: Whoa ! Easy , Fouch . I do n't like where you 're going .
LARRY: I 'm telling you . Dr. Hendricks , every vote was accounted for .
JIM: Larry ? We 've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly , and we still have to do counts for VP , Treasurer and Secretary . Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers , and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
LARRY: But , Mr. M. -
WALT: Fouch , that 's enough ! End of story .
TRACY: Paul , I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out , you 've run a wonderful campaign . It 's been fun competing with you .
PAUL: Yeah , you too , Tracy . I 'm just glad it 's over .
TRACY: Yeah .
JIM: If we could get started . People ! Once the winners are announced , we can all go home , okay ?
PAUL: Geez , you guys , thanks a lot . I mean , wow , thanks . I promise to do my best and really do a good job and be a good president . And I want to thank Lisa Flanagan for being a super campaign manager . And I just want to say that I think Tracy would have made a great president too and that she really deserves a big hand .
JIM: And now , for vice-president .
PAUL: Wow ! Mr. McAllister ! This is so wild . We came to celebrate my victory , and I ca n't believe it . Here , these are my parents .

PAUL: I never would have ran if it was n't fo Mr. M .
JIM: Paul does n't need any of my help . He 's going places . You should be very proud .
JO: We are
DICK: Having a problem with your eye there ?
JO: Dick .
JIM: Just a bee sting .
DICK: You ought to get that looked at . Shot of cortisone or something .
JIM: Thanks , I 'll be fine .
DICK: Anyway , we 're awful sorry about what went on with our other one , you know , our Tammy .
JO: We were mortified
JIM: Oh , she 's not a bad girl . She 'll come around .
JO: but we 've had some good talks , and I think we 're sorting things out . We 're starting her at Sacred Heart in the fall .
JIM: Good school .

DICK: All right . Well , sure nice to meet you .
JO: So nice
JIM: You bet .
PAUL: So , Mr. M , I was starting to think about ideas for next year . I was thinking it would be cool to have , like a carnival . With rides . And , you know , it could be for , like . Muscula Dystrophy .
JIM: Paul Paul . We 'll have plenty of time to get into all this later . A whole year , in fact . Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home .
PAUL: Oh , okay . Yeah , sorry .

TREVES: I 'll join you shortly .
OLDER MAN: A wicked birth
BARKER: Ladies and Gentlemen , his lungs are larger than this mammoth blacksmith 's ellows . So great is his power of exhalation , rivaling even that of the Great North Wind , that he will now challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut as he applies the mighty blast of his herculean eath ! Are there any volunteers ?
THE LADS: Yes we are Right etc .
BARKER: Ladies and Gentlemen ! Let the demonstration begin ! !
BOBBIES: Make way ! Make way ! They round a corner .
SKELETON MAN: I refuse to believe it ! I will not accept it ! Those babies are simply too ugly , they can not be mine ! The crowd laughs uproariously .
FAT LADY: Darling , do n't be difficult ! Let 's take our sweet lovely children on an outing .
SKELETON MAN: We 'll take these miserable whelps on an outing , alright ! We 'll take them to the zoo WHERE THEY WILL STAY !
FAT LADY: Children save yourselves ! Prevail upon your Pappa !
DWARVES: Poppa ! Poppa ! Poppa , please !
FATHER: This is too much ! They should not allow it ! They should not allow it !
WOMAN: Beast , Beast
BOBBY: No ! That 's right out ! Drop the curtain !
OWNER: You ca n't do that ! I 've got my rights !
ALDERMAN: I have the authority to close you down , and I 'm doing just that !
OWNER: He 's a freak ! How else can he live ?
ALDERMAN: Freaks are one thing . No one objects to freaks , but this is entirely different . This is monstrous , and ought not to be allowed . These officers will see to it that you are on your way as soon as possible . Good day . The alderman turns and leaves the tent .
OWNER: Movin ' again ! He shakes his head in disgust .
TREVES: Forgive me
FOX: Three quarters of an hour .
TREVES: Mmmm . Hodges , Pierce come closer . Mr. Hill , take hold of the rope please . It 's a machine accident . I expect you 'll be seeing a good deal of this .
FOX: What a mess .
TREVES: What got you into medicine , Hodges ?
HODGES: My father , sir . He 's built quite a successful practice . I hope to take it over one day .
TREVES: Is that your case as well , Pierce ?
PIERCE: Yes sir . Though of course I do have a great desire to help my fellowman . Treves smiles at them knowingly .
TREVES: Of course you do realize that medicine has changed quite a bit since you father 's time . In those days we did n't even wash our coats . In fact , the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon was his black operating coat , so stiff with dried blood and pus that it could stand up by itself in the corner . I 've still got mine upstairs You do n't mind blood , do you ?
BOY: Excuse me , Mr. Treves , sir .
TREVES: Yes ?
BOY: I found it .
TREVES: Did you see it ? The Boy shakes his head slowly , `` No . ''
FOX: I say Freddie , what are you about ?
TREVES: Oh nothing nothing of any great importance .
OWNER: He 's not a peeler
BOY: No , I do n't think so .
OWNER: No I do n't think so . They walk into the street .
TREVES: Are you the proprietor ?
OWNER: And who might you be , sir ?
TREVES: Just one of the curious . I 'd like to see it .
OWNER: I do n't think so . No sir , we 're closed .
TREVES: I 'd pay handsomely for a private showing . Are you the proprietor ?
OWNER: Handsomely ? Who sent you ?
TREVES: Pardon me ?
OWNER: Never mind . I 'm the owner . He snatches the money .
BOY: Stand up !
OWNER: Turn around !
BOY: Turn around ! Turn around !
TREVES: So you 'll bring him to me , tomorrow , 10 00 a.m. ? Mr ?
OWNER: Bytes . Mr. Bytes . He 'll be there .
TREVES: I 'll send a cab . Here is my card .
OWNER: Now we got a deal We understand each other guv . We understand each other completely .
CABMAN: Not at all , sir . My pleasure . He exits . Treves turns and sees the Matron , staring .
TREVES: I 'll be in my rooms , Mothershead . I 'm not to be disturbed .
MATRON: You heard the doctor Go on .
TREVES: My name is Frederick Treves I am a surgeon here at the London Hospital , and I lecture in anatomy at the Medical College I would very much like to examine you . Would that be all right ?
FOX: Freddie , what you doing for I say do open a window in here or He notices the hooded figure .
TREVES: You 'll know presently . At the meeting of the society . But until then , I eg of you Fox , keep it to yourself .
FOX: Certainly , if you insist . You must have quite a find there .
TREVES: I do n't know what I 've got .
FOX: Nothing of any importance , eh ? Treves turns to go back in , then stops .
TREVES: I 'll tell you this much , Fox , it 's eyond anything you or I have eve dealt with . Keep it to yourself , please . He goes back in , shutting the door .
TREVES: Come sit down .
TREVES: He is English , he is twenty-one years of age and his name is John Merrick . Gentlemen , in the course of my profession I have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease , as well as mutilations and contortions of the body , depending upon like causes ; but , at no time have I met with such a dreaded o perverted version of a human being as this man . I wish to draw you attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient . Note , if you will , the extreme enlargement of the skull and upper limb , which is totally useless . The alarming curvature of the spine Turn him , please the looseness of the skin , and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90 % of the body .
TREVES: Hmm ?
FOX: You never mentioned his mental state .
TREVES: He 's imbecile , no doubt from birth . He speaks , but it 's all gibberish . No , the man 's a homeless idiot I pray God he 's an idiot .
THE FIRST: Quite a coup , Freddie . You 'll look splendid in the journal .
THE SECOND: Where ever did you find that creature ?
ANNE: Did it go well , darling ?
TREVES: Yes , very well , I think . Are the girls in bed ?
ANNE: Yes , and they send their kisses . Would you like your sherry now ?
TREVES: No , I think a whiskey .
BYTES: Belt up , you misbegotten garbage . How can I eat with that ?
BOY: Bytes ! DO N'T Bytes goes right on with the beating .
BYTES: This wo n't do , my lad . This just wo n't do !
BOY: Our man is sick . Come right away .
TREVES: What is it ?
BOY: Like this .
TREVES: I 'll get my bag .
BYTES: What did you do to him ? He 's been like this all night !
TREVES: What do you mean ?
BYTES: He was fine when he left here , and now look at him .
TREVES: I intend to .
BYTES: He fell . He falls .
TREVES: He must have taken quite a fall .
BYTES: He 's a clumsy git . Never watches where he is going .
TREVES: Why is he sitting up like this ? He needs rest .
BYTES: That 's the way he sleeps . If he lays down , he 'll die . Head 's too heavy .
TREVES: This man belongs in hospital .
BYTES: Ca n't you fix him up here ? He 's my livelihood . Listen .
TREVES: You listen , you 're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies . He 's got the rale , he 's very weak , and I do n't know how much damage has been done by his `` fall '' . Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab .
BYTES: I really appreciate this , guv . You know , there 's lot of things that I can do for you . I move in the prope circles , for this type of thing ( motioning toward the
TREVES: Everything will be seen to .
MOTHERSHEAD: Nora ! Mind your duties if you do n't concentrate dear , you 'll only make more work for the rest of us . Now , get about your business . and do get your collar straight , dear .
NORA: I 'm so sorry , Mrs. Mothershead .
MOTHERSHEAD: Do get on with it , Nora .
TREVES: I do n't know if you will understand this , but you will never go back to that man again . You 're safe now . No one will ever harm you . Do you understand ? The two men just look at each other .
NURSE: Breakfasting with the patients this morning , Mr. Treves ?
TREVES: It 's for a patient .
CARR: Mr. Treves , come over here a moment , wo n't you ?
TREVES: Good morning , sir .
CARR: You 've acquired a taste for this ?
TREVES: It 's quite nutritious , sir .
CARR: Do n't be mad . This muck can kill you .
NORA: Yes , sir .
TREVES: Do n't be frightened . He wo n't hurt you .
CARR: Indeed !
TREVES: No sir , he 's got bronchitis and he 's een badly beaten .
CARR: Why is n't he in the General Ward , then ?
TREVES: Well sir , he 's quite seriously deformed , and I fear the othe patients would find him rathe shocking .
CARR: Deformed ? Is that it . Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable ?
TREVES: Yes sir .
CARR: What are your plans then , Treves You are aware that the London does not accept incurables . The rules are quite clear on that point .
TREVES: Yes , I 'm well aware of that . But this case is quite exceptional .
CARR: Oh , is he a friend of yours ?
TREVES: No , more of an acquaintance .
CARR: I certainly sympathize with you problem , Treves Why do n't you try the British Home , or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him .
TREVES: Yes sir , I 'll look into that . Would you like to meet him sir ?
CARR: The Elephant Man ?
TREVES: I 'm sorry , my dear , I should have warned you . I 'm so terribly sorry , please forgive me . There , you 're alright now . Go downstairs and please ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up . Tell her to knock on the door and wait for me . Alright ?
NORA: Yes Sir . I 'm sorry , Sir . Drying her eyes , she goes downstairs .
TREVES: I 'm very sorry about that . Are you esting well ? The E.M. makes a garbled sound .
OTHER NURSES: Did you see him ?
NORA: Yes .
OTHER NURSES: What 's wrong with him ? We see Nora 's face . She is silent .
TREVES: Ah , Mothershead . How are you feeling today ?
MOTHERSHEAD: Fine .
TREVES: Good . Excellent . Now then , Mrs. Mothershead , I want you to come into this room with me . Inside there is a man with a rather unfortunate appearance .
MOTHERSHEAD: I 've heard .
TREVES: Yes Well , I want you to clear up a little mess , a breakfast tray was spilt . And bring up another breakfast . When you 've done that , you and I shall give the man a bath . But , Mothershead , I 'm counting on you many years of experience to get you through this , Above all , do not scream , do not cry out , or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him
MOTHERSHEAD: Sir , you do n't have to worry about me . I 'm not the sort to cry out . Shall we go in ?
TREVES: Yes Yes , let 's go in . Treves opens the door .
TREVES: I would like you to meet Mrs. Mothershead - Mrs. Mothershead , Mr. John Merrick .
MOTHERSHEAD: How do you do ?
TREVES: The disease is shocking . Merrick 's eyes flicker .
MOTHERSHEAD: Sit still . Do n't wiggle about like a pup . I wo n't stand for any foolishness .
TREVES: Yes ! The workhouse !
NIGHT PORTER: What 's all this , then ?
YOUNG PORTER: Mr. Treves is scrubbing his Elephant Man .
NIGHT PORTER: Elephant Man ?
YOUNG PORTER: Yeah I hear it 's a real horror . Even made Mothershead scream .
NIGHT PORTER: Friend of the night , eh ? The Elephant Man . I think I 'll have me a look at that .
NIGHT PORTER: Hush , love , I told you before one word from me , they 'll toss you back on the street , and then those pretty little arms of yours will never grow straight . Now close your eyes .
NIGHT PORTER: Here he is , the old fiend of the night , the terror of the London . Let 's have a look at you . Let 's see what makes 'em scream
MILKMAN: Here early again , eh Mr. Treves ? If you do n't mind my saying so , sir , with your early habits , you 'd ' a made a fine milkman .
TREVES: Good morning , Charley . I 'll keep that in mind ! Treves walks up the path into the hospital .
MOTHERSHEAD: Good morning , Mr. Treves . It 'll be his bath-time soon . Has he eaten ?
TREVES: Not quite yet , Mrs. Mothershead . There seems to be some difficulty this morning .
MOTHERSHEAD: Wo n't come out , eh ?
TREVES: No , he 's very upset about something .
MOTHERSHEAD: Just being obstinate , sir . I 'll handle it .
TREVES: No ! Do n't pull at him like that . We do n't want to frighten him more than he already is .
MOTHERSHEAD: Honestly , sir , you must be very firm with this sort . Otherwise they 'd lay about on the floor gibbering all day long . All he understands is a good smack .
TREVES: He 's had his share of `` smacks '' , Mothershead . I expect that 's what drives him under the bed . We must use patience and understanding with this man .
MOTHERSHEAD: Perhaps you 've got the time for that , Mr. Treves , I certainly do n't . I 've got an entire hospital to look after , and you have your real patients . Do n't waste your time with him sir , it 's like talking to a wall . I do n't mean to be harsh , but truthfully what can you do for him ? I 'll be ack later for his bath . And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment . Good day sir .
TREVES: What good am I to you ?
MERRICK: Yyyy Yyye yyyess .
TREVES: Yes John !
MERRICK: Yyes
TREVES: Yyyess .
MERRICK: Yyess .
TREVES: That 's much better . I could understand that `` yes '' .
MERRICK: Yes !
TREVES: Very good ! Oh yes ! Now listen . I 'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them um I want you to say them back to me . Do you understand ? I 'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me . Do you understand ?
MERRICK: Yes .
TREVES: Excellent ! Now , say `` Hello ''
MERRICK: Hello
TREVES: My name is
MERRICK: My name is
TREVES: John Merrick .
MERRICK: John Merrick
TREVES: Say `` Merrick '' .
MERRICK: Merrick
TREVES: Say `` Mmmerrick . ''
MERRICK: Mmmerrick .
TREVES: Say `` Mmmerrick . ''
MERRICK: Mmmerrick .
TREVES: Well , that 's alright . I understand you . Now , say the whole thing again , Hello
MERRICK: Hello my name is John Merrick .
NORA: Oh , Mrs. Mothershead , please forgive my behavior yesterday . I 'm sorry if you 're having to do extra work on my account . It was just seeing it
MOTHERSHEAD: Patients here are not `` its '' . They are either `` he 's '' or `` she 's '' , but that 's alright , Ireland . This one 's going to be more work for all of us . Good God girl ! Mind your broth .
TREVES: Come in . Mothershead enters .
MERRICK: Hello , my name is John Merrick .
MOTHERSHEAD: Good Lord , Mr. Treves !
TREVES: We 've made tremendous strides today , Mothershead . He listens and repeats with great attention , and this certainly is n't easy for him .
MOTHERSHEAD: Parrots can do as much , Mr. Treves . It 's all very nice , but I do n't see the point . You know they wo n't let him stay here .
TREVES: I 'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they 'd see that he 's the exception to their rule . Now I 'm not expecting miracles . I 'm not saying he 'll be able to read or write , but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself . I 'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now . That was very good , John , very good . That 's all for today . We shall do some more tomorrow . Mothershead ?
CARR: Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital ?
TREVES: Ah , no sir . I had planned to see them in the morning .
CARR: Good ! How is the patient ?
TREVES: He 's doing very well . In fact that 's why I came to see you . I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee , then they would have a chance to see fo themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease , but of the man as well . If the committee had a chance to speak with him , hear him say a few words for himself , I 'm sure they would see him as a patient , ather than as a violation of the ules .
CARR: A few words ? I thought he was imbecile ?
TREVES: Well sir , perhaps I should explain
CARR: I really do n't think that 's necessary Treves . I 'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case , such as they are .
TREVES: I do n't agree . No one can make a easonable decision about this man 's future without at least meeting him . No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met .
CARR: No , Treves , it 's out of the question . Now if it was up to me , I 'd say `` Certainly , let 's meet the fellow , y all means , '' I 'm sorry , I simply ca n't speak for the other members of the committee .
TREVES: Then will you meet him , as a epresentative of the committee .
CARR: Mr. Treves , it 's out of the question . I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do . I 'm sorry .
BYTES: I want my man back .
TREVES: Just a moment , how did you get in here ?
BYTES: Never mind that , I want my man !
TREVES: He 's still very sick . Please come downstairs with me . I 'll explain the situation .
BYTES: DO N'T Do n't muck me about . You 've had plenty of time to fix him up , and he 's leaving with me , NOW . Do you understand me ? Now , Mr. Treves . We had a bargain !
TREVES: You misunderstood . This man suffered a severe fall , if you take my meaning . He 's my patient now and I must do what
BYTES: Pull the other one , why do n't you ! We made a deal !
TREVES: I know what you 've done to him and he 's never going back to that .
BYTES: He 's a freak ! That 's how they live . We 're partners , him and I , business partners . You 're willfully deprivin ' me of my livlihood !
TREVES: All you do is profit from anothe man 's misery !
BYTES: You think you 're better ' n me ? YOU wanted the freak to show all you doctor chums and make a name fo yourself , you guv . So I gave him to you . On trust , in the name of science ! And now I want him back .
TREVES: You do n't own this man !
BYTES: I want him back !
TREVES: So you can beat him ? So you can starve him ? A dog in the street would fare etter with you !
BYTES: I 've got my rights , damn you , and I 'm going to the authorities !
CARR: By all means do so . In fact , I 'll fetch them myself . I 'm quite sure they 'd be very interested in you story , as well as ours .
TREVES: Now I think we really do understand one another .
BYTES: Right Right .
CARR: Singularly unpleasant chap uh I do n't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your patient , Mr. Treves .
TREVES: Thank you very much Sir . Shall we say in a few days then ?
CARR: Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon ?
TREVES: Wh whatever is most convenient for you , sir .
CARR: Two o'clock then you know Treves It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance .
TREVES: Yes , Sir .
CARR: Elephant Man ? I do n't want to meet an Elephant Man .
ANNE: Freddie ? Getting no response she renews her efforts .
TREVES: I should n't be . We made great progress today . I taught him to repeat a few asic phrases . He did rather well , too , but I had to lead him every step of the way . Though frankly , at times I was unsure of who was leading whom .
ANNE: What do you mean ?
TREVES: Well , I was n't sure whether he was parroting me because that 's all he was capable of , or whether he sensed that that 's all I wanted to hear , and he was trying to please me .
ANNE: But I thought you said that he was ather simple ?
TREVES: He is . I mean , I 've always thought he was . I think he must be . Is he simple ? Or is that just something I 've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself ? Anne puts down the brush and rises .
ANNE: Frederick , why are you so interested in this particular case ?
TREVES: I do n't know . I ca n't explain it . If this is an intelligent man , trapped in the body of a monster , then I 'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind , free that spirit as est I can , to help him live as full and content a life as possible . But ! If he 's an imbecile , who 's body I ca n't treat and who 's mind I ca n't touch , well , then my obligation is discharged . They can put him where they will ; he wo n't be bothered , I wo n't be bothered , and everyone 's conscience can remain free and untroubled . And that is my dilemma what is in his mind ?
ANNE: Perhaps you 're just polishing a stone , endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he does n't possess ?
TREVES: And what qualities are those ? Intelligence or stupidity ?
ANNE: I 'm sure I do n't know , Freddie .
TREVES: I 'm sorry I do n't know either . I just do n't know .
ANNE: Well , these things take time .
TREVES: I 've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon , when Carr Gomm meets him . Somehow , between now and then I 've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man Why am I fooling myself ? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm
TREVES: Righteousness
MERRICK: Hello , my name is John Merrick . I am very pleased to meet you !
TREVES: It 's only a physical problem . He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth . But he can talk , and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him . So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying , just tell me and I 'll make it clear .
CARR: Speaking is one thing , Treves , but can the man comprehend ? Treves can not easily answer this question .
TREVES: As I said , it 's only a physical problem but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you 're taking the time and trouble to meet him , and he 's most anxious to make a good impression , so he might seem ather nervous .
CARR: He need n't . I have no desire to cause him any discomfort . Did you make those inquiries we spoke about ?
TREVES: Yes , I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital fo Incurables . I 'm afraid that they were n't very encouraging , but they said they 'd bring it up at thei next committee meeting , so we should have their answers shortly .
CARR: Fine , fine . You know , your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing , Treves . But you must remember that this is a hospital , and there are many patients here . Patients who can e made well , and you owe them you first consideration . Just do n't become so obsessed , old man , that you begin to neglect them .
MERRICK: Come in .
TREVES: John , may I introduce you to Si Carr Gomm .
MERRICK: Hello my name is John Merrick . I am very pleased to meet you .
CARR: I 'm very pleased to meet you .
MERRICK: I feel much better . Thank you fo asking . And you ?
CARR: I 'm feeling very fit , thank you . How is your bronchitis ?
MERRICK: I feel much better . Thank you .
CARR: Are you comfortable here ?
MERRICK: Everyone has been very kind . I am extremely grateful .
TREVES: Mr. Merrick likes the food here . Do n't you John ?
MERRICK: Oh yes ! It is much better than what I am used to .
CARR: Oh yes ?
TREVES: And what was that , John ?
MERRICK: Potatoes There is another agonizing silence .
TREVES: Yes potatoes but
MERRICK: But the variety of food here is very pleasing I commend you .
CARR: I understand that you were beaten ?
DIERRICK: Oh no , everyone has been very kind .
CARR: No , I meant in your former situation . Merrick does n't seem to understand .
MERRICK: I 'm feeling much better now
CARR: Tell me , how do you like Mr. Treves ? As a teacher ? Treves stiffens .
MERRICK: I everyone has been very kind to me .
CARR: Of course . How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview ?
MERRICK: everyone has been very kind .
CARR: Yes , of course Well , it 's been a pleasure meeting you , Mr. Merrick . Good day .
TREVES: Thank you , John . You did very well .
MERRICK: The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
CARR: It was a nice try , Treves , but the man is so obviously mouthing you words .
TREVES: Yes , I 'm very sorry to have wasted your time , sir . I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him .
CARR: I 'm sorry too . He simply does n't elong here . He 's be much happie somewhere else , where he could be constantly looked after . Believe me , Frederick , it 's better that it worked out this way . Good day .
TREVES: I did n't teach him that part !
MERRICK: My cup runneth over . Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life , and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever .
TREVES: How did you , know the rest ? I neve taught you the rest of it .
CARR: I do n't understand .
TREVES: Tell me , John , how did you know the est of the 23rd Psalm ?
MERRICK: I I used to read the Bible every day . I know it very well . The Bible , and the Book of Common Prayer . The 23rd Psalm is very beautiful .
MERRICK: I am very pleased to meet you .
CARR: I hope we can talk together again sometime . Good day .
TREVES: I 'll be right back . He closes the door .
CARR: I want to see you in my office as soon as you 're through up here . We 've a good deal to discuss . He starts down the stairs .
TREVES: Of course , sir . Thank you , thank you very much . Carr Gomm stops on the stairs .
CARR: Treves . Well done .
TREVES: Not me , sir . Mr. Merrick . He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness .
TREVES: Why did you let me go on like that , teaching you what you already knew ? Why did n't you tell me you could ead ?
MERRICK: You did not ask me .
TREVES: I never thought to ask . How can you ever forgive me ?
MERRICK: Oh , no do not say that . You have een so kind to me . I was afraid to say too much . People always want me to be quiet . You wanted me to speak , ut I was afraid . Forgive me .
TREVES: We do have a lot to talk about , do n't we ?
CARR: Can you imagine what his life has een like ?
TREVES: Yes , I think I can .
CARR: No you ca n't . You ca n't begin to know , no one can . Carr Gomm suddenly stands and faces Treves .
TREVES: I could easily arrange
CARR: No , not that way . Broadneck and the others do n't like to deal with patients directly . It makes them queasy Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick ?
TREVES: Well , yes .
CARR: Excellent . We shall present them , along with the other particulars of the case to the committee . I want them to see , exactly , how horribly his body has been affected . You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities .
TREVES: Do you think they 'll go along with us ?
CARR: Of course they will . They 're easonable men .
MOTHERSHEAD: Read it . Merrick looks down at the Bible .
MERRICK: Thou heardest my voice ; hide not thine ear at my breathing , At my cry .
MOTHERSHEAD: Credit where credit is due . You 'll have the paper every morning at eakfast .
NIGHT PORTER: I hear you have some trouble sleepin '
MERRICK: Noooo !
NIGHT PORTER: No No you ca n't ! One word about me out of that stinking cakehole Just ONE word , and you 'll have no trouble at sleepin ' no trouble at all . You understand me ? Do you ! !
MERRICK: Yyyesss .
NIGHT PORTER: There now , that 's better , i ' n ' it ?
CARR: As far as I can see , the only obstacle might be Broadneck . He has enormous influence over the others , very old school , not an easy man to impress . In any case , if worse does come to worse , we still have the British and Royal Homes to fall back on , do n't we . Treves is silent . They stop .
TREVES: No , we do n't . Their committees have informed me that they 're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick , even if they were supplied with funds . They do n't want him .
CARR: Well , it 's up to us then , is n't it ? They continue walking .
TREVES: Forgive the redundancy , gentlemen , ut there is no other place for him . Both the Royal Hospital and the British Home have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were provided . The workhouse is certainly out of the question . The patient has an overwhelming fear of eturning to the horrors of his past . His appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him . He can not , in justice to others , be put in the general ward of the workhouse . The police rightly prevent his being exhibited , and he is mobbed in the streets wherever he goes . What is to e done with him ?
BROADNECK: I , for one , am sick and tired of this competitive freak-hunting by these overly ambitious young doctors , trying to make names for themselves . To parade then about in front of the pathological society is one thing , ut to waste this committee 's valuable time with requests for shelter fo these abominations of nature is quite another .
TREVES: Gentlemen , John Merrick is not an animal , he is a man , fully aware of his condition . An intelligent , sensitive , literate man , with an intimate knowledge of the Bible . His horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is , a man ; and it would be criminal if we of the London Hospital , his final refuge , the last place on earth where this man can find peace , were to cast him out .
CARR: Gentlemen , may I make a suggestion . There are two small rooms off Bedstead Square that are no longer in use and would be admirably suited to Mr. Merrick 's needs . I also propose to write a letter to The Times , appealing to their readers for assistance . Knowing the generosity of the British public , I feel we would have little trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance . Indeed , this hospital 's ules do preclude the admission of incurables , but if ever there was an exception to the rule , it is this patient . So therefore , I propose , if Mr. Treves is finished , that we put it to a vote . All those in favor of keeping Mr. Merrick here ?
BROADNECK: One moment , as far as I 'm concerned this creature has no business being in our hospital . I think Mr. Carr Gomm 's letter would e an excellent idea , and when you appeal for funds , I think you should appeal for a more appropriate place for him as well . I agree the British public is generous , and I 'm sure that somewhere the creature will find a happy and permanent home , but not here .
CARR: I see . All , then , that move we keep Mr. Merrick here ?
BROADNECK: Well then . In the meantime , of course , he need n't be turned out . He may stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square until such time as more suitable arrangements can be made , thus freeing the Isolation Ward for more deserving patients . Well then , Mr. Chairman , if there is nothing further to discuss , I move that we adjourn this meeting and all go bout our normal usiness . Carr Gomm can not conceal his contempt .
CARR: I second the motion gentlemen . This meeting is adjourned .
WOMAN: terrible though his appearance is , so terrible indeed that women and nervous persons fly in terro from the sight of him , and that he is debarred from seeking to earn his livelihood in any ordinary way , yet he is superior in intelligence , can ead and write , is quiet , gentle , not to say even refined in his mind . She turns to the girl thoughtfully .
#1 DOCTOR: `` in life until he came under the kind care of the nursing staff of the London Hospital and the surgeon who has befriended him ''
#2 DOCTOR: Good publicity for the Hospital , at any rate .
#3 DOCTOR: Treves comes off well too , eh Freddie ?
#4 DOCTOR: It was pleasant of you to join us this evening , Frederick .
#2 DOCTOR: Your Elephant Man dining out this evening ?
#4 DOCTOR: I understand the kitchen ran out of hay this morning . The group laughs .
FOX: Do continue reading , Mr. Stanley , please .
#1 DOCTOR: `` it is a case of singula affliction brought about through no fault of himself ; he can but hope for quiet and privacy during a life which Mr. Treves assures me is not likely to be long , '' There is a short pause .
#4 DOCTOR: The Elephant Man . Makes you sound ather more like a zoo-keeper than a surgeon , Frederick .
TREVES: Excuse me gentlemen . I seem to have lost my appetite . Good evening . Treves leaves the room .
#4 DOCTOR: I say , what 's he on about ?
#3 DOCTOR: He 's getting a bit of a swelled head , if you ask me .
FOX: Well , no one did ask you Atkins . Frederick Treves is not only the most skillful surgical operator here , he 's also a humanitarian of the highest order . You sound like a pack of whining school boys with you petty jealousies .
#3 DOCTOR: Look here , Fox , I simply said .
FOX: Oh belt up ! A deep silence falls over the Doctors .
1ST WOMAN: There are cleaner rooms in the gasworks .
2ND WOMAN: Do n't you know ? It 's for that strange one .
1ST WOMAN: Mr. Treves ' Elephant Man ? I hea he 's got a trunk .
2ND WOMAN: Right , right .
MERRICK: `` A silent shaft of stone on a deserted promontory , the lonely Eddystone is a beacon of aid and comfort to mariners of all nations . ''
TREVES: Good evening . How are you feeling ?
MERRICK: Good evening . Very well , thank you . And you ?
TREVES: Very well , thank you . I have something for you , John . I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it , it 's very popular .
MERRICK: Thank you so much oh it 's eautiful !
TREVES: I came to tell you that I 'll be here early tomorrow morning . We 're moving you to your permanent home . I 'm sure you 'll be very happy there , John . So get a good night 's rest , there 'll be new people to meet tomorrow . Good night . Treves smiles broadly and exits .
MERRICK: Good night .
NIGHT PORTER: Here listen to this . This is a letter to THE London Times from the guvnor of the hospital . There is now in a little room off one of our attic wards a man named John Merrick , so dreadful a sight that he is unable even to come out y daylight to the garden . He has een called The Elephant Man on account of his terrible deformity
MERRICK: Workhouse !
TREVES: This is your new home , John .
MERRICK: This is my new home ?
TREVES: Yes .
MERRICK: The hospital ?
TREVES: Of course ! What did you think ?
MERRICK: How long will I stay here ?
TREVES: I promise you . You will never see the inside of that horrible place again . You will never , ever go back to the workhouse or that man . It 's a splendid room , do n't you think ?
MERRICK: When I 'm next moved may I go to a lighthouse ? or to a blind-asylum ?
TREVES: Has the response picked up ?
CARR: Frankly , Treves , it 's not what I 'd expected . A few small cheques . Well- wishers . Do n't worry , these things undoubtedly take time .
TREVES: But he 's so afraid he 's going to be carted off . I 've promised him that wo n't happen .
CARR: Well I 'll let you know if there 's something in the afternoon post .
TREVES: Please do .
MOTHERSHEAD: Well , I think I can safely hand the duties over to you girls now . Mr. Merrick will require a bath every day that way he wo n't pong quite so much . Nora , you can instruct Kathleen on the finer points of Mr. Merrick 's bath . You 'll be on you own tomorrow . The girls try to keep bright faces .
KATHLEEN: He 's so ugly !
NORA: Ugly or not , you 're going to help me .
MERRICK: Yes . Kathleen 's eyes go wide at the sound .
NORA: You look very nice in your new clothes . Merrick looks down at himself .
MERRICK: Thank you very much .
NORA: Well , if there is nothing more , I suppose we 'll be leaving you now .
MERRICK: No , nothing . The girls leave , taking the buckets .
TREVES: You look splendid , John .
MERRICK: Thank you very much .
TREVES: When one is invited to tea , one must look one 's best .
ANNE: I 'm very pleased to meet you , Mr. Merrick .
MERRICK: I 'm very
TREVES: John what 's the matter ? John why are you upset ?
MERRICK: I 'm not used to such kindness . From a beautiful woman . Treves and Anne exchange worried looks .
ANNNE: Would you like a nice cup of tea , Mr. Merrick ?
MERRICK: Yes thank you .
TREVES: Yes , a cup of tea would go nicely . Anne goes now to get the tea .
ANNE: Mr. Merrick , sugar ?
MERRICK: Yes please , two .
ANNE: One or two ?
MERRICK: Two , please . Anne serves the tea .
TREVES: John loves the house .
ANNE: Do you ?
MERRICK: Oh yes . You have so many nice things , and so much room .
ANNE: Oh ?
TREVES: Yes , we do have a lot of room . But you should see the place on weekends , when I see patients here . Sometimes there are so many , we have to set them down wherever we can . In fact , Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the only room she can call her own is the bedroom .
MERRICK: Well , it 's a lovely bedroom . What do you call that thing above the bed ?
TREVES: That 's a canopy , John .
MERRICK: Ohhh
TREVES: How is your tea , John ?
MERRICK: It 's very good . I 'm enjoying my visit with you very much . It 's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home . I 'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself .
TREVES: Not at all , John .
MERRICK: I love the way you 've arranged you pictures on the mantlepiece . Is that the way it 's done in most houses ?
TREVES: Oh yes .
MERRICK: Who are they of ?
TREVES: Oh , our relatives the children .
MERRICK: The children ! May I see ?
TREVES: Of course .
MERRICK: The Children . Where are your children
TREVES: Oh , they 're gone for the day with friends .
MERRICK: Friends . Ah yes , friends ! How nice .
ANNE: And here is one of Frederick 's mother .
MERRICK: How lovely .
TREVES: Yes .
ANNE: And here are my mother and father .
MERRICK: They have noble faces .
ANNE: I 've always thought that myself .
MERRICK: Oh , yes . Merrick sets the picture down carefully .
TREVES: Your mother ?
MERRICK: Here .
ANNE: Oh why Mr. Merrick she 's beautiful .
MERRICK: She has the face of an angel She was an angel . She was so kind so kind to me . It 's not her fault , fo in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant . I 'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her .
ANNE: Oh no , Mr. Merrick . No . No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment .
MERRICK: If only I could find her . If only she could see me now , here , with such lovely kind friends . You , Mrs. Treves , and you , Mr. Treves . Then maybe she would love me as I am . I 've tried to hard to be good .
NORA: Good morning , Mr. Merrick .
MERRICK: Good morning .
NORA: What is this that you 're doing ? Merrick is silent .
MERRICK: Yes .
NORA: But it 's so good , I mean it 's so very good .
MERRICK: Thank you very much .
NORA: Where did you get this box ? Merrick points out toward the hallway .
MERRICK: I meant no harm , it was the only place where I could find cardboard . I thought it has been thrown away .
NORA: It 's alright , it was thrown away . No one wants it . It 's just that it 's a little dirty , that 's all .
MERRICK: The main spire .
NORA: The oh , the spire ! How silly of me , it 's as plain as day Mr. Merrick , where did you learn to do this ?
MERRICK: I learned a long time ago . Nora looks at the box .
NORA: Oh , but how will you finish it ? You have n't any more cardboard .
MERRICK: I 'll have to find some more .
NORA: Yes well , good day , Mr. Merrick .
MERRICK: Come in . Treves enters .
TREVES: Good morning , John .
MERRICK: Good morning .
TREVES: John , there 's someone here who would like to meet you . Would that be alright ?
KENDAL: Good day , Mr. Merrick .
MERRICK: Good day !
KENDAL: I 've brought you some things . I hope you 'll like , Mr. Merrick . I hope you do n't think it too forward .
MERRICK: Oh , no .
KENDAL: I knew you 'd understand . Here .
MERRICK: Oh , no . I would never think it ! It 's so beautiful . You are so I 'll give it a place of honor , here , next to my mother .
KENDAL: She 's very pretty , your mother .
MERRICK: Yes . Treves smiles at them .
KENDAL: Oh no , Mr. Merrick . I just work there .
MERRICK: Well , even to work there would be wonderful . Is it beautiful ?
KENDAL: You 've never been ?
MERRICK: Alas , no .
KENDAL: Well you must go . It is one of the most beautiful places on earth . Of course , I 'm rather partial .
MERRICK: Tell me about it , please !
KENDAL: It 's very difficult to put into a nutshell , but I should say the theate is the shrine of the imagination , where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world , to any time you desire . You may look ove the shoulders of kings , unobserved , attle with ruthless tyrants , and marry the beautiful princess , all in the space of a few hours . Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be , do anything you please , and always , always live happily ever after . The theatre is all the brightest and est things of the world , Mr. Merrick . It is lights and music , gaiety and joy . It 's well , it 's romance .
MERRICK: Romance !
KENDAL: That 's one thing the theatre has in great store . which reminds me . I have something else for you
MERRICK: No , but I certainly shall . Merrick finds a place and begins to read .
KENDAL: Good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , Which mannerly devotion shows in this ; For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch , And palm to palm is holy palmer 's kiss .
MERRICK: Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
KENDAL: Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
MERRICK: O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do . They pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
KENDAL: Why , Mr. Merrick , you 're not an Elephant Man at all
MERRICK: Oh no ?
KENDAL: Oh no no you 're a Romeo .
BYTES: So , there you are , my boy , my treasure .
GIRL: Mummy , listen to this !
MUMMY: Hush , Jennifer , ca n't you see Mummy 's talking ?
GIRL: But it 's about Mrs. Kendal , mummy ! The actress you go on so much about ! She has got the women 's attention .
WOMAN: Parkins , whose carriage is that ?
DRIVER: Well mum , that looks like Alexander , Lord Waddington 's driver .
WOMAN: Lord and Lady Waddington ! Well . Drive ack to the house . I ca n't be seen in this . They drive off .
MERRICK: Thank you for your kind gifts . I ca n't say enough about this ring . And this walking stick is ever so dashing . So much more elegant than my old one . More tea ?
THE LADY: Oh no , no , no , I 'm fine . Please I mean , thank you .
MERRICK: I do n't get out as often as I 'd like to , for some people DO find my appearance disturbing . Of course , I ca n't fault them . We see the smiling pictures .
MOTHERSHEAD: Watery headed bunch .
TREVES: I regret that I must leave you here , m ' Lord , m ' Lady . Thank you so much for coming . It was an act of the greatest charity .
LADY WADDINGTON: Oh no , Mr. Treves , the pleasure was all ours . Good day .
TREVES: Incredible , is n't it ? Well , I think John has had enough visitors for one day , Mothershead . I 've got a lecture at the college , I 'll be back this evening .
MOTHERSHEAD: Excuse me , sir . I 'd like to have a word with you .
TREVES: Oh ? Well , quickly please , Mothershead , I 'm overdue .
MOTHERSHEAD: I ca n't understand why you let those people go in there , sir .
TREVES: Now Mothershead , you have to understand that this is very good for John . He relishes contact with people outside the hospital
MOTHERSHEAD: But you saw them , sir . They could n't hide their disgust . They do n't care anything for John , they 're just trying to impress their friends .
TREVES: Are n't you being just a little harsh , Mothershead ? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived .
MOTHERSHEAD: I bathed him , did n't I ? I fed him and cleaned up after him ! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern , then yes , I did treat him with loving kindness , and I 'm not ashamed to say it .
TREVES: You 're right , Mothershead , please forgive me Of course , I appreciate everything you 've done for John , and I 'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare . But , I 'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think est . I 'm also very late , so please forgive me .
MOTHERSHEAD: If you ask me , sir , he 's just being stared at all over again .
MERRICK: When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye ? When will the wind be aweary of lowing over the sky ? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting ? When will the heart be aweary of eating , and nature die ?
TREVES: Never , oh ! Never , nothing will die . the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die .
MERRICK: Mr. Treves , there is something I 've een meaning to ask you for some time
TREVES: Yes , John ?
MERRICK: Can you cure me ?
TREVES: No John , I ca n't . I can care fo you , but I ca n't cure you .
MERRICK: I thought as much .
TREVES: John ? There 's a knock at the door .
MERRICK: Come in .
TREVES: Are you looking for me , Sister ?
NORA: No sir , Mr. Merrick . I have something for you .
TREVES: The cathedral is coming along nicely .
MERRICK: Yes , soon I will start the main spire , ut I must finish these columns first , How kind of her !
TREVES: How blind of me . Is there anything else , John , anything at all that I could get for you ?
MERRICK: Oh no ! There is nothing ! I have everything , you have given me everything I could possibly want . I am happy every hour of the day . I only wish there was something I could give to you .
TREVES: Please John , it would give me so much pleasure to give you something . Something just for yourself . Is n't there something you would like to have ?
MERRICK: You do n't think it 's too gaudy , do you ?
MOTHERSHEAD: Mr. Treves , some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick .
TREVES: Thank you , Mothershead . Have a porte put them in my office .
MOTHERSHEAD: Yes sir . What 's that ?
TREVES: A dressing bag .
MOTHERSHEAD: Very smart indeed .
TREVES: Yes . John wants it .
MOTHERSHEAD: A dressing bag ?
TREVES: You do n't think it 's too gaudy , do you .
MOTHERSHEAD: Well
TREVES: John thinks it 's very dashing . Something no gentleman should be without . I 'm inclined to agree . He walks off .
MOTHERSHEAD: A dressing bag ?
MERRICK: Night !
TREVES: You stay with me .
ANNE: Dinner will be served , shortly , dear . Getting no response , she enters .
TREVES: Hmmm ?
ANNE: Freddie ! What 's the matter ? You 've een like this all evening .
TREVES: Oh I 've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said .
ANNE: Oh , Freddie . What could that wretched vampire say to upset you ?
TREVES: That I am very little different from him .
ANNE: Oh that 's absurd , Frederick . No , no Frederick , that 's all wrong ! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life . And , that is completely due to you .
TREVES: But why did I do it ? What was this all for ? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort ? Or so I could become famous ?
ANNE: Frederick , just what is it that you are saying ?
TREVES: Am I a good man or am I a bad man ?
ANNE: Oh Frederick . She holds him in her arms .
CARR: Ahh ! Broadneck ! You 'll no doubt be pleased to know that we 've received a smashing response to my letter . It 's all very heartwarming , though several letters do mention how beastly it would be to part the poor fellow from Mr. Treves and the staff , but since the committee insists
BROADNECK: Good day , Carr Gomm .
MOTHERSHEAD: Is this all there is for John ?
CARR: I 'm afraid so , Mrs. Mothershead . Perhaps tomorrow .
MOTHERSHEAD: What is it ? What is it ?
TREVES: Do n't you think this is a bit premature ? We do n't have the backing yet to
CARR: Steady on , Treves . Have a seat .
BROADNECK: Mr. Chairman ! I was under the distinct impression that we had concluded discussion of this disagreeable matter . Had we not ascertained that an Elephant Man is not acceptable as a patient ? Have we not , very generously , allowed the creature to use two of our rooms until such time as he could be properly disposed of ? Have we not
MERRICK: I must be more careful !
BROADNECK: Which brings to mind my next point . The rules , gentlemen , the rules . In a society such as ours , it is of paramount importance that we not stray from the established order . Has that order not already been fearfully strained by allowing this this sideshow exhibit to take up esidence , however temporary , in two very useful rooms , the purpose of which would be far better served in accommodating treatable patients , patients to whom this hospital was originally dedicated ? I believe we have a duty
MERRICK: Ladybug , ladybug , fly away home it 's cloudy out , I know , but remember ; ehind the clouds there is always the sun .
BROADNECK: In light of these facts , our course is clear . The question is not whethe to accept this creature as a patient , the question is when will those rooms e vacated for use by bette qualified , more deserving cases ? I move that this Elephant Man be removed from the premises immediately . We have a sacred duty to cure the sick , not care for circus animals . That is my last word on the subject . Mr. Chairman , shall we vote ?
CARR GOMM: I take it , Mr. Broadneck , that you mind is fixed on this matter ? Broadneck blusters with rage .
BROADNECK: Mr. Chairman ! Do n't you have ears ? I am unalterably opposed to any
CARR: Yes , I believe that time has come . The two footmen enter the room .
1ST FOOTMAN: Gentlemen , Her Royal Highness Alexandra , Princess of Wales .
ALIX: Good morning , gentlemen . I hope I am not interrupting ?
CARR: Indeed not , your Highness . You presence is always greatly appreciated . We were just about to put the matter of Mr. Merrick to a vote . The Princess is very interested in Mr. Merrick 's fate .
ALIX: Indeed I am sir , as is the Queen . I have a brief communication from her Highness which she has requested I read to you To the Governing Committee , London Hospital . I would very much like to commend you fo the charitable face you have shown Mr. John Merrick , the Elephant Man . It is laudable that you have provided one of England 's most unfortunate sons with a safe and tranquil harbour , a home . For this immeasurable kindness , as well as the many othe acts of mercy on behalf of the poor , of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed , I gratefully thank you . Signed Victoria , Empress of India , Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . I am sure you gentlemen may be counted on to do the Christian thing . Alix seats herself .
CARR: Thank you very much , your Highness , you may be sure we shall . Broadneck seems very unnerved .
MERRICK: Please , come in .
TREVES: Good afternoon , John , Mr. Carr Gomm has something he would like to say to you . Treves defers to Carr Gomm .
CARR: Mr. Merrick , it is my great pleasure to welcome you , officially to The London Hospital . The Governing Committee this morning voted unanimously to provide you these ooms on a permanent basis . This is your home now . I 'm so very , very pleased for you .

TREVES: Yes , he 's my friend .
MERRICK: Mr. Treves ! Treves .
TREVES: John . how can you ever forgive me ?
KENDAL: It 's all arranged . I 'll send ove some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick . You 'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box .
TREVES: I 'm very grateful to you , Mrs. Kendal . This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal . John will be very excited .
KENDAL: Well it is a miracle he ever got ack . And , I 'm sure , Mr. Treves , under your expert care , he 'll have many happy years ahead .
TREVES: I fear not , Mrs. Kendal . Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly as is his pain .
KENDAL: How awful for John .
TREVES: And yet , not once have any of us heard him complain .
KENDAL: Is he dying then ?
TREVES: Yes . There is nothing more frustrating , nothing that makes a physician feel more useless , than standing by watching his patient deteriorate . And when that patient is a friend , no no , there 's absolutely nothing I can do .
KENDAL: Well , it 's all quite I 've neve heard It 's quite
TREVES: Yes .
MERRICK: You women are such strange and wonderful creatures Alas , it seems to be my fate to fall in love with each and everyone of you . I especially wish you could all be with me tonight I 'm finally going to the theatre .
CHORUS: O for a Muse of fire , that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention , A kingdom for a stage , princes to act And monarchs to behold the swelling scene ! Then should the warlike Harry , like himself , Assume the port of Mars ; and at his heels , Leash 'd in like hounds , should famine , sword and fire Crouch for employment . But pardon , gentles all , The flat unraised spirits that have dar 'd On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth So great an object can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of Rance ? Or may we cram Within this wooden O the very casques That did affright the air at Agincourt ? O , pardon ! since a crooked figure may Attest in little place a million ; And let us , ciphers to this great account , On your imaginary forces work .
K. HEN: Fair Katharine , and most fair , will you vouchsafe to teach a soldie terms Such as will enter at a lady 's ea And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart ?
KATH: Your majesty shall mock at me ; I can not speak your England .
K. HEN: O fair Katharine , if you will love me soundly with your French heart , I will be glad to hear you confess it okenly with your English tongue . Do you like me , Kate ?
KATH: Pardonnez-moi , I can not tell vat is `` like me '' .
K. HEN: An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
KATH: O bon Dieu ! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies .
K. HEN: What say you , fair one ? That the tongues of men are full of deceits ?
KATH: Oui , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits .
K. HEN: I know no way to mince it in love , ut directly to say `` I love you '' . What ! A speaker is but a prater ; a hyme is but a ballad . A good leg will fall ; a straight back will stoop ; a black beard will turn white ; a curl 'd pate will grow bald ; a fai face will wither ; a full eye will wax hollow ; but a good heart , Kate , is the sun and the moon , or rathe the sun and not the moon ; for it shines bright and never changes , but keeps his course truly .
CHORUS: Thus far , with rough and allunable pen , Our bending author hath pursued the story , In little room confining mighty men , Mangling by starts the full course of their glory . Small time , but in that small most greatly liv 'd This star of England Fortune made his sword ; By which the world 's best garden he achiev 'd .
MRS. KENDAL: Thank you for your warm greeting . Ladies and gentlemen , tonight 's performance was very special to me , ecause it was very special to someone else , a man who knows the theatre and loves the theatre , and yet tonight is the first time he 's ever actually een here . I would like to dedicate the whole company wishes to dedicate , from their hearts , tonight 's performance to Mr. John Merrick , my dear friend .
TREVES: Stand up , John . Let them see you .
MERRICK: Oh no , I could n't .
TREVES: It 's for you , John . It 's all fo you . Go ahead , let them see you .
MERRICK: I feel as if I 've traveled my whole life just to stand here .
MERRICK: Was n't Mrs. Kendal wonderful ? I ca n't lame the King for wanting to marry her .
TREVES: Will the cathedral be finished soon , John ?
MERRICK: Yes , very soon .
TREVES: Splendid . it 's truly a masterpiece . Well , I suppose I 'll be on my way now . I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening .
MERRICK: Oh yes ! It was wonderful !
TREVES: I 'm glad , John . Goodnight . He turns and starts out the door .
MERRICK: Mr. Treves ? Treves comes back to Merrick .
TREVES: Yes John ?
MERRICK: Mr. Treves , tell me tell me truly . Is it alright , did I make any mistakes that you can see ?
TREVES: No , John , not one that I can see .
MERRICK: Then I should n't change anything ?
TREVES: No , no , I would n't change a thing . The two look at each other silently .
MERRICK: I 'll walk you to the door .
TREVES: Goodnight John . Sleep well .
MERRICK: You too , my friend . Goodnight .

ELIZABETH: Mary Stuart is my cousin . She is our guest . And she is under ou control .
HOWARD: But while she lives , majesty , she is a beacon that draws ou enemies ' eyes and hopes .
ELIZABETH: While she lives ?
HATTON: She is the poison at the heart of England . The poison must be cut out .
ELIZABETH: You 'd have me make a martyr of her . What is her crime ?
HOWARD: We must act , majesty . Ou inaction is taken to be weakness .
ELIZABETH: If any of my people break the
HATTON: Until the day they rise in ebellion ! Majesty , we have proven reason to fear every Catholic in the land -
ELIZABETH: Fear creates fear , sir . I will not punish my people for thei eliefs . Only for their deeds . am assured that the people of England love their Queen . My constant endeavour is to earn that love .
WALSINGHAM: The people are agitated .
ELIZABETH: What people ?
WALSINGHAM: Your bishops are preaching that God is showing his displeasure- the Queen being still unmarried - some are saying infertile -
ELIZABETH: What nonsense !
WALSINGHAM: Dangerous nonsense . Mary Stuart has a son -
ELIZABETH: Why does everyone torment me with
WALSINGHAM: So long as you have no issue . Elizabeth looks back at Wsalsingham .
ELIZABETH: Is n't it customary to obtain a

BESS: And sweet breath .
ELIZABETH: So that you can kiss him without choking .
WALSINGHAM: They care for your safety , majesty . The threats to you person are real .
ELIZABETH: And they know very well that if I fall , they all come tumbling down after me .
RALEIGH: Let England know we 're back , M Calley .
MASTER GUNNER: Run out and prime . From the bow number one gun , on my word -
ELIZABETH: Lines round my mouth . Where did they come from ?
BESS: Smile lines , my lady .
ELIZABETH: Smile lines ? When do I smile ?
PHILIP: ` Elizabeth ! The angels weep fo you , Elizabeth ! Why do you close your ears to the voice of you loving God ? '
PHILIP: Every tree that falls hurts me . I lose a part of myself . I am cursed with sensitivity . I feel too much .
RESTON: Your majesty has a merciful soul .
PHILIP: I sacrifice my country 's forests to save the souls of a lost nation . That is true mercy . England is lost to darkness , Father . I bring light .
RESTON: The light of purifying fire .
MARY: This is so pretty I 'm inclined to send it as a present to my dea cousin Elizabeth .
ANNETTE: My Queen .
MARY: Our friends write to give us hope .
ANNETTE: Soon England 's true believers will rise up against the bastard usurper Elizabeth , and slit he throat , and throw her down to hell .
MARY: That 's enough , Annette . Slit her throat ? Please .
ANNETTE: And when the bastard usurper is dead , my lady will be queen . The chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning .
MARY: Here 's my noble jailer , come to smack my hand .
PAULET: No , no , my lady . Unless beauty is counted a sin .
MARY: Oh , you jailer . I do n't trust you .
PAULET: Not jailer , my lady , please . Warden . Protector . Friend . You are the Queen 's guest .
MARY: See how I pass my time in my lonely prison .
PAULET: Charming , ma'am . Distractingly charming .
SAVAGE: We live in dangerous times .
ARMOURER: We do indeed .
SAVAGE: The conspiracy gains strength .
RESTON: I ask for your forgiveness .
CROWD: God bless your majesty - God love you ! - See her sweet face !
ALEIGH: A puddle in the way , majesty .
ELIZABETH: A puddle
ROYAL SERVANT: The Queen is at her prayers !
ELIZABETH: A puddle
RALEIGH: She spoke to me . You have to give me that .
CALLEY: Oh , I do . The Queen spoke to you . One word - but she spoke .
RALEIGH: Two words .
CALLEY: You 're made . A dukedom at the very least .
RALEIGH: Did you see the girl behind her ? I 've been at sea too long .
ALSINGHAM: Thousands are dying every day of famine in Ireland . Anothe ebellion is a distinct possibility .
COURTIER: Francis of Valois , majesty .
ELIZABETH: You have the plans for the new docks ?
HOWARD: Here , majesty .
WALSINGHAM: We still need to keep France out of the arms of Spain .
ELIZABETH: Let me think on it . What if enemy ships should sail up the Thames ? Can the docks be closed ?
HOWARD: Not closed , majesty . But the gun positions here , and here , have full command of the channel . The courtier displays a second portrait .

WALSINGHAM: Still madly in love with you .
ELIZABETH: Still mad , you mean . . Where 's Bess ? The courtier presents a third portrait .
COURTIER: Ivan , Tsar of all the Russias , known as `` The Terrible . '' Walsingham merely shakes his head .
DOORKEEPER: You 'll have to see the Lord Chamberlain , sir .
RALEIGH: And when will he come out ?
DOORKEEPER: There 's no way of knowing that , sir .

ELIZABETH: I become almost enthusiastic . to Hatton ) Send for him . Where is he , then ?
WALSINGHAM: Virginity is an asset that holds its value well .
LIZABETH: Diplomatically speaking .
DON GUERAU: Majesty , this man is a notorious pirate .

DON GUERAU: Spanish treasure , stolen from Spanish ships . You will see .
ELIZABETH: Well , sir . Who are you ?
RALEIGH: Walter Raleigh , your majesty .
RALEIGH: A gentleman of Devon .
ELIZABETH: What do you want ?
RALEIGH: The honour to be in the presence of my Queen , whose radiant beauty is the boast and glory of the English people .
ELIZABETH: Yes , well , here you are .
ALEIGH: I 'm just returned from the New World , majesty . I have claimed the fertile coast in your name , and called it Virginia , in honou of our Virgin Queen . Elizabeth raises her eyebrows .
ELIZABETH: Virginia ? And if I marry ? Will you change the name to Conjugia ? A royal joke . Her entourage laughs dutifully .
RALEIGH: I ask for your gracious permission , majesty , to return to the New World with your royal warrant , to found a colony unde the laws and protections of England .
ELIZABETH: Who are they ?
RALEIGH: Americans , majesty . They long to e your newest subjects .

ELIZABETH: Continue .
RALEIGH: Gold . You spend it . Very satisfying .
ELIZABETH: The fruits of piracy after all , it seems .
RALEIGH: Philip of Spain is no friend of England , majesty . The more gold I take from him , the safer you will e .
ELIZABETH: Well , well . A political pirate . A logic-chopping pirate .
RALEIGH: And your majesty 's most loyal subject . She gives him a long look .
ELIZABETH: But not my best dressed . W elcome home , Mr Raleigh .

SERVANT: Visitor waiting , sir .
WALSINGHAM: You look terrible . Do n't they feed you in Paris ? How are you studies ? Learned the secrets of the universe yet ?
WILLIAM: Not yet .
WALSINGHAM: These are dangerous times to be questioning the ways of God . You must take care of yourself .
WILLIAM: My needs are simple .
WALSINGHAM: You 'll dine with us ? You 'll lodge with us ?
MARY WALSINGHAM: William !
WILLIAM: Look at you ! All grown up .
URSULA: William . This is a pleasure .
WILLIAM: I 've been away too long , ma'am .
MARY WALSINGHAM: You come with me , William .
URSULA: Have you spoken to the Queen ?
WALSINGHAM: I speak to her daily .
URSULA: You know what I mean . You 've done enough . No man could do more .
WALSINGHAM: I ca n't leave court yet . The Queen needs me .
URSULA: So you 're to die in harness like a pack horse , are you ? And fo what ? Mary ! William !
WALSINGHAM: These are difficult times-
URSULA: It 's always difficult times .
WALSINGHAM: William , come and tell us all the new ideas in the University . Will the great breach in the church ever be healed ?
WILLIAM: I doubt it , brother . Compromise is out of fashion . On both sides they say there can only be one truth , and one God .
URSULA: Sit , sit .
MARY: H ere by me , William .
WALSINGHAM: What do they say in Paris of the Pope 's call for holy war ?
WILLIAM: Many welcome it .
URSULA: I do n't understand why we must all hate each other .
WILLIAM: Truth will always hate falsehood , ma'am .
MARY: Why do we have to talk about war ? Tell us your nice news , William . Are you married yet ?
WILLIAM: Not yet .
MARY: Then we must find you a nice sensible English wife .
WILLIAM: No , no . I wo n't be staying long . I must go back to my studies .
WALSINGHAM: Not too soon , I hope . Every man deserves a rest .
URSULA: Listen to him ! When did you last est , I 'd like to know ? He wo n't listen to me . Not a thought for his health . You tell him , he 's your brother . He 'll die at his desk , out of shee selfishness .
LIZABETH: Your highness does me great honour . Shall we eat our dinner ? It should prove almost as estorative as my love .
COURT LADY: So tell me , Mr Raleigh , in you sea battles - how do you sink an enemy ship ? You shoot holes in its sides , I suppose .
RALEIGH: No , ma'am . A sunk ship is of no value . The object is to capture and command .
COURT LADY: And how do you do that ?
RALEIGH: Surprise . Speed . Irresistible violence . Calley , listening , rolls his eyes .
ELIZABETH: I think you 're not as accustomed as I am to eating in public . I have a secret . lowering her voice ) I pretend there 's a pane of glass - eine Glasscheibe - between me and them .
ELIZABETH: They can see me , but they ca n't hear me , or touch me . You should try it . She beckons to Bess .
BESS: Him , my lady ?
ELIZABETH: Him .
ARCHDUKE CHARLES: No man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a Queen .
ELIZABETH: ( You play the game very well , my young friend . But do n't you
ELIZABETH: ( You 're thinking , perhaps , that
COURT LADY: I adore the natives you brought ack with you . I do n't suppose you could get one for me ? They 're not dangerous , are they ?
RALEIGH: That depends what you propose to do with them .
COURT LADY: I 'd dress him up in mulberry- coloured silk and have him walk ehind me , carrying my cloak .
BESS: The pirate is not too bored by the vanities of the court , I hope .
RALEIGH: A simple sailor , dazzled by the ight lights . Bess draws him away from the court ladies .
BESS: If you can bring yourself to leave the dazzle of the bright lights for a moment -
RALEIGH: D rawn away by the brightest light of all .
BESS: That can only mean the Queen .
RALEIGH: I do n't presume to raise my eyes so high .
BESS: It seems you 've presumed afte all .
RALEIGH: It seems you 're determined to think the worst of me .
BESS: Tell me what it is you really want .
RALEIGH: What every man wants . Money . Fame . Love .
BESS: In that order ?
RALEIGH: Each leads to the next . The money will buy and equip ships for a eturn voyage to the New World . The success of my infant colony there will make me famous . The fame will bring me love .
BESS: It seems rather a long way round .
RALEIGH: There are benefits along the way . It is something , after all , to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city .
BESS: Which you will no doubt name after yourself .
RALEIGH: No doubt . B
ESS: Well , then . I am answered .
RALEIGH: May I ask a question in return ?
BESS: Of course .
RALEIGH: How am I to win the Queen 's favour ?
BESS: Why should I tell you that , sir ?
RALEIGH: I 've little enough to offer , I know . But whatever I have to give - ask , and it 's yours . Bess thinks for a moment .
BESS: My advice to you is , say what you mean to say as plainly as possible . All men flatter the Queen in the hope of advancement . Pay her the compliment of truth . She gives him her hand . He kisses it .
RALEIGH: I do n't even know your name .
BESS: Elizabeth Throckmorton .
RALEIGH: A second Elizabeth .
BESS: Everyone calls me Bess .
ELIZABETH: His highness the Archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him . He will retire to his private quarters to rest .
BESS: He is certainly charming , my lady .
ELIZABETH: There are duller professions . And what is it he hopes to gain by his charms ?
BESS: He hopes for glory in his New World . He dreams of building a shining city .
BESS: It 's refreshing to meet a man who looks to a world beyond the court .
ELIZABETH: So it is . We shall let him come again .
MARY: Dismissed ? On whose orders ?
ANNETTE: The Warden , my lady .
MARY: The Warden ? My Warden ?
PAULET: That was not my motive , ma'am .
MARY: How am I to send my intimate letters ?
PAULET: Through me .
MARY: And you will read them .
PAULET: With respectful admiration .
MARY: Am I to have no privacy ?
PAULET: No . Beneath the charm , steel .
MARY: You disappoint me , sir .
PAULET: The Queen orders these measures for your protection .
MARY: The Queen ! Am I not a Queen too ? What if I wish to write a love letter ? Is Elizabeth to be sent a copy ? Is she so starved of lovers that she must feed on mine ?
PAULET: The Queen grieved when you husband died , ma'am . As she grieved when your second husband
MARY: Tormentor ! Is that Elizabeth 's order too ? That you torment and mock me ?
MARY: She 's called the virgin queen . Why is that , sir ? Can it be that
PAULET: I am your servant , ma'am , and your admirer .
MARY: I shall send no more letters . I shall stay here quietly , in my prison . With you .
HATTON: Majesty , the Archduke and the court are waiting .
ELIZABETH: Let them wait ! Go on , Mr Raleigh . You were hoping . Hatton bows and leaves , frowning .
RALEIGH: At first it 's no more than a haze on the horizon , the ghost of a haze , the pure line corrupted . But clouds do that , and storms . So you watch , you watch .
ELIZABETH: The Queen lives for her people . You will therefore forgive me , sir , if after much thought and prayer I decline your offer of marriage .
BESS: Well ? Are you satisfied with the Queen 's favour ?
RALEIGH: She listened as if she understood me .
ESS: Then I shall expect some gratitude . R
ALEIGH: What do you want ?
BESS: I expect I 'll think of something .
ELIZABETH: Mr. Raleigh .
RALEIGH: You speak like a true explorer .
ELIZABETH: I like you , Mr Raleigh .
RALEIGH: And I like you .
ELIZABETH: You know , of course , that when I like a man , I reward him .
ALEIGH: I have heard that .
ELIZABETH: And what have you to say about it ? R
ALEIGH: Reward my mission , majesty , not me .
ELIZABETH: Is the mission not the man ?
RALEIGH: Leave me free to like you in eturn . That can be my reward .
ELIZABETH: Go on .
RALEIGH: I think it must be hard for so great a Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked fo herself .
ELIZABETH: Now you become dull .
RALEIGH: Mine ! Elizabeth shakes her head , unable to speak .
ELIZABETH: You have - the stronger horse .
RALEIGH: Whoa ! Whoa ! Forgive me , majesty . My horse does n't know his place yet Elizabeth looks at him , amused , intrigued .
ELIZABETH: Have you ever known your place , Mr. Raleigh ?
RALEIGH: I 'm a sailor , majesty .
ELIZABETH: And can sailors not be lovers ?
ELIZABETH: Ah , I see . You like love bette
ELIZABETH: When I marry , I marry for my country .
RALEIGH: Some
ELIZABETH: You 've yet to meet your equal ? Raleigh hesitates . She understands him .
RALEIGH: I would want someone who knows me as I am .
ELIZABETH: You want a friend , not just an equal . You want someone to share your joy when you 're happy .
BESS: George ! What 's wrong ? Is you father alright ?
THROCKMORTON: He 's old . He wo n't live long now . Thank you for coming , dear Bess .
BESS: I was worried . You must send me no more letters . You know what would happen if I was caught .
THROCKMORTON: I need your help .
BESS: Do you need more money ?
THROCKMORTON: My father is a tired old man . We do n't want to hide like this
BESS: You are known Papists .
THROCKMORTON: The Queen loves you . Speak to her .
BESS: I can not betray the Queen .
THROCKMORTON: You are not betraying her . My
BESS: Do n't put me in danger like this .
THROCKMORTON: Cousin Bess , we 've known each other all our lives . I would do nothing to harm you .
BESS: I 'm sorry .
THROCKMORTON: If they catch us , they will kill us . Our lives are in your hands .
LIZABETH: Do n't tease me , Mr Raleigh . There 's nothing I 'd like to do more .
RALEIGH: So why do n't you ?
ELIZABETH: Alright , then . I will . He blinks caught by surprise .
ELIZABETH: Would you like to go to sea , Bess ?
BESS: Majesty ?
RALEIGH: I 'm afraid that 's not possible . Women bring bad luck on board ship .
ELIZABETH: Oh , do they ?
RALEIGH: Lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room , fo months at a time - Men have needs . A beautiful woman like you would drive us all mad .
ELIZABETH: Men have needs ?
WALSINGHAM: Mr Raleigh . A word of advice . The Queen chooses to show you favour . You naturally wish to take advantage of that . Do n't ask for too much .
RALEIGH: You think all I want is money .
WALSINGHAM: I hope all you want is money .
RALEIGH: You think I 'm a cynical adventurer , with little breeding and less education . You 're wrong . I 'm a cynical adventurer with little breeding and an excellent education .
WALSINGHAM: I begin to see why the Queen likes you .
HROCKMORTON: Bess ?
ELIZABETH: No , do n't stop . I like it .
BESS: I hope you believe that I like you for yourself , my lady .
ELIZABETH: Is anybody ever liked just fo themselves ? Are you ? I doubt it . Men like you because you 're pretty . And because you have the ear of the Queen .
BESS: No doubt , my lady .
ELIZABETH: Him too . He likes you because he wants my favour . You do realise that ?
BESS: Yes , my lady .
ELIZABETH: And the other thing too , of course . But all men want that . Male desire confers no B distinction .
LIZABETH: I envy you , Bess . You 're free to have - what I ca n't have . You 're my adventurer . Do n't be afraid . It 's all over so soon .
WALSINGHAM: Still nothing to tell me , M Throckmorton ? Throckmorton struggles to lift his head .
WALSINGHAM: I know about the Enterprise . I need names . But if you wo n't help me , perhaps your father will .
THROCKMORTON: No !
WALSINGHAM: Well ?
HATTON: Another letter has come from Mary Stuart , majesty . Asking to meet you .
ELIZABETH: Filled with declarations of love ?
HATTON: As always .
ELIZABETH: If she wants my love , let he deserve it . Refused .
RALEIGH: You have more important concerns
ELIZABETH: There is always other business . But I have been waiting too . Walsingham enters .
WALSINGHAM: Majesty .
ELIZABETH: Yes , Walsingham ?
WALSINGHAM: The traitor has talked , majesty . The traitor Throckmorton .
ELIZABETH: Forgive me , sir . As you see , my time is not my own .
TORTURER: You 'll never guess what I heard - A knife at his throat . A quick slash .
ELIZABETH: What do you know of the Enterprise of England , Ambassador ?
DON GUERAU: The Enterprise ? Forgive me , your majesty
ELIZABETH: It 's a plan for the invasion of my country . Two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and -
WALSINGHAM: Norfolk .
ELIZABETH: And Norfolk . Mary Stuart is to be set free , and placed on the English throne .
DON GUERAU: I know nothing of any invasion plans .
ELIZABETH: I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of England . It should more accurately be called ` la Empresa di Inglaterra ' , because it 's a Spanish plan . The plan of your king , my one-time brother-in- law , Philip II , to attack my country .
ELIZABETH: You will leave my presence , sir ! Go back to Spain ! Tell Philip that I do n't fear him , or his priests , or his armies . Tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us , we 're ready to give him such a bite he 'll wish he 'd kept his hands in his pockets .
DON GUERAU: You see a leaf fall , and you think you know which way the wind lows . But a wind is coming , madam , that will sweep away you pride .
ELIZABETH: I too can command the wind , sir . I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare , if you dare to try me !
PHILIP: The workmen kneel to Philip as he passes .
RALEIGH: The Queen has sent you to me .
BESS: Yes -
RALEIGH: Tell the Queen that I will
BESS: The Queen asks me to assure you -
RALEIGH: I need no assurances . I 'm no courtier and never have been . I 've lost my appetite for playing games that it seems I 'm too stupid to understand .
BESS: That is unfair -
RALEIGH: You call me unfair !
BESS: Let me speak !
ELIZABETH: You ask permission to go .
RALEIGH: Yes , majesty .
ELIZABETH: You plan to return to the New World . To your colony . For two , or three , or four years .
RALEIGH: If your majesty grants me you oyal warrant .
ELIZABETH: That is a long time .
RALEIGH: There 's nothing left for me to do here . At sea I know what I 'm to do , I know the risks , I know the ewards . Here -
ELIZABETH: But you 're quite wrong . You are needed here . I have decided to appoint you Captain of my personal guard .
RALEIGH: Captain of your - !
ELIZABETH: Kneel .
RALEIGH: This is too great an honour .
ELIZABETH: If it 's such an honour , why are you staring at your boots ?
RALEIGH: You know why .
ELIZABETH: Now you stare at the wall . Am I so old and hideous that you ca n't even look me in the face ? He turns now , and looks her in the face .
RALEIGH: Why do you talk like a fool when you 're anything but a fool ?
ELIZABETH: My friend , forgive me . I 'm a vain and foolish woman . At court it 's all a game . I like to be admired . I require it . I grow accustomed to it . But it 's all - nothing .
ELIZABETH: The storm clouds are gathering , my friend . Please do n't leave me now .
BABINGTON: Francis is about to die ! We must act ! R
ESTON: He enters heaven as a soldie eturns home victorious from war .
BABINGTON: Why do n't we strike ? What 's he dying for ? Is this part of you plan ?
RESTON: Lord , be with us as the end approaches .
BESS: Oh ! It 's you !
RALEIGH: I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to disturb you .
BESS: My prayer 's done . She rises to her feet .
RALEIGH: Something has distressed you .
BESS: And I thought I prayed in silence .
RALEIGH: So you did .
BESS: A man was hanged today . A Papist . I knew him well . He was my cousin . He died because I gave information . I gave information to prove my loyalty . Because I was afraid .
RALEIGH: That 's necessity . That 's the world we live in .
BESS: He told me he wanted to change . Become part of the new England . I was afraid that he was lying to me . But what if - what if it was true ?
RALEIGH: If you knew him well , you will have sensed the truth .
BESS: I thought so .
RALEIGH: He was hoping to use you . You did
BURTON: Morning . Another filthy day on God 's stinking earth .
GUARD: Morning to you .
URTON: Last cask !
ELLARMAN: Nothing but beer . Satisfied ?
ANNETTE: Madame ! Madame !
MARY: The gentlemen are ready . It will e soon now .
ANNETTE: Blessed Mother of God pray fo us !
MARY: Bring me pen and paper , Annette . They wait on my reply . Hurry , now , hurry !
DEE: The alignment of the planets is most unusual this year . Mars is due to take the ascendant three days after the anniversary of your birth - your majesty was orn on September 7th - and I see that twelve days before the anniversary of your birth -
ELIZABETH: Princes of the female gender .
DEE: I mean to say , a prince who is also a woman .
ELIZABETH: Yes , Dr Dee . I am following you . So what does it all mean ?
ELIZABETH: Which empire is to rise , and which is to fall ?
DEE: That I ca n't say . Astrology is , as yet , more an art than a science .
WALSINGHAM: Nothing more , Dr Dee ? No more specific calamities that we can guard against ?
ELIZABETH: He means , Will I be assassinated ?
WALSINGHAM: Queens are mortal . Dr Dee smiles as he gently contradicts him .
DEE: Elizabeth is mortal . The Queen will never die .
ELIZABETH: You see , Francis ? This is a mystery . He has no patience with mysteries . W
ALSINGHAM: What I do n't know , I ca n't use .
DEE: And yet mysteries have power . Have you not learned that ?
ELIZABETH: Francis . Leave us for a moment .
DEE: These are matters of state , majesty .
ELIZABETH: Do the stars not foretell matters of state ?
DEE: For such a prediction , I must look in a different chart .
DEE: Something has weakened you
ELIZABETH: An art , not a science . I understand .
RESTON: You have it ?
BESS: Please ! I 'm innocent ! I 've always een a loyal servant of the Queen . I 'd never betray the Queen , never -
WALSINGHAM: But you have , my dear . And you do . We both know that .
WALSINGHAM: Keep me informed , and all will be well . I do n't like surprises . He leaves .
DANCING MASTER: Jump !
ANCING MASTER: When I push like this , my lady , give a jump into the air .
ELIZABETH: Let him throw you round , Bess . You can trust him .
DANCING MASTER: And round - and round - and round - and down !
LIZABETH: L a Volta , Mr Raleigh . The jump . I equire all my ladies to learn it . You see how fearless Bess is . Raleigh watches Bess dance .
RALEIGH: You like your ladies to jump at your command ?
ELIZABETH: Sometimes . Do you think that wrong ?
RALEIGH: No , no . You 're the Queen . You are to be obeyed .
ELIZABETH: To tell you the truth , M Raleigh , there are times when I 'm tired of being always in control .
RALEIGH: Nonsense .
ELIZABETH: What ?
RALEIGH: You do n't mean a word of it . You eat and drink control .
ELIZABETH: Do you say so ? The exercise ends . All clap .
RALEIGH: No skill at all , majesty . I do n't know the steps .
ELIZABETH: Oh , it 's very simple .
DANCING MASTER: Your majesty knows the dance etter than I .
ELIZABETH: So come , Mr Raleigh . Take you position . I am to be obeyed .
RALEIGH: As your majesty wishes .
ELIZABETH: Hold her tight . I do n't want he dropped .
ARY: Am I a danger to England even when I pray ?
MARY: I pray for my cousin Elizabeth . Do you think she prays for me ?
RESTON: ` If our forces are in readiness , oth within and without the ealm , then your Queen commands you to set the gentlemen to work . '
WILLIAM: This is the spark that will set England ablaze .
ESTON: We 've been patient long enough . Let God 's work begin .
WILLIAM: It 's me . William .
WALSINGHAM: Where have you been ? We have n't seen you for days .
WILLIAM: I met up with some old friends .
WALSINGHAM: From Paris , no doubt .
WILLIAM: Yes .
WALSINGHAM: And now you 've come back . He looks up at last .
WALSINGHAM: What then ? What would you murde your own brother for ?
WILLIAM: Eternal life .
WALSINGHAM: Eternal life . The bribe no man can refuse .
ROYAL SERVANT: The Queen is at her prayers !
BABINGTON: Now ! Ramsay hurls himself forward , shouting -
RAMSAY: God for Mary ! England 's true Queen !
BABINGTON: Elizabeth !
MARY: You bring news ?
PAULET: The Queen has been attacked -
MARY: Yes ?
PAULET: The assassin seized -
MARY: Yes ?
PAULET: The Queen unharmed -
MARY: Unharmed ?
PAULET: And you , ma'am , are under arrest .
MARY: Me ? What has any of this to do with me ?
PAULET: My own invention . Theatrical , but effective . My master has every letter you 've written .
MARY: Your master ?
PAULET: Walsingham . Now she knows it 's over . She begins to weep .
MARY: Traitors . I 'm surrounded by traitors . Who am I to trust ?
WALSINGHAM: Ready to die , I see , Jesuit .
RESTON: I have done what I was sent to do .
WALSINGHAM: Why was the gun not loaded ?
WILLIAM: To kill the Queen . You know it . You know everything .
WALSINGHAM: Not quite everything .
WILLIAM: I 've told you all I know . Go ahead and kill me . Take what 's left of me . I do n't care any more . All my life you 've had everything and I 've had nothing . So finish it . There 's a bette world waiting for me . We 'll all e judged in the end , brother . Even you .
WALSINGHAM: You 're no martyr . You were n't even much of a murderer . Go back to France . Back to your dreams . Never let me hear of you again .
RESTON: Send me home .
ELIZABETH: They say she 's taller than me . Her hair is chestnut in colour . Her eyes are hazel . They say she 's beautiful . But people lie . They say I am beautiful .
BESS: She plotted to kill you .
ELIZABETH: Yes , it 's true . I 've read he letters . I too was a prisone
BESS: So do we all .
ELIZABETH: I can be merciful . But she
BESS: She 'll go on lying til you cut
ELIZABETH: You used to be gentler , Bess .
BESS: I used to be quieter , majesty .
MARY: Who are you to sit in judgement on me ? By what authority do you condemn a Queen ? God alone has made me what I am . He is my only judge . Raise your law above God 's law , and what law remains ? In your vanity and ignorance you set loose the monster of misrule . You know neither who you are nor what you do . But I know who I am . I die as I have lived - trusting in the mercy of my God - a Queen .
ELIZABETH: Must die ? Mary Stuart must die ? Where is it written ? Who dares to
ALSINGHAM: Majesty , this is no time fo mercy -
ELIZABETH: Do n't preach at me , old man . Look at you ! You can hardly stand . Go home to your wife . Go home to your bed .
WALSINGHAM: The law must have its way .
ELIZABETH: The law is for common men , not for princes .
BESS: Thank God you 've come . I 've neve seen her so distressed . She 's een alone in her rooms since morning . She 'll see no one .
RALEIGH: Has she asked for me ?
BESS: No . But she needs you . I know she does . Raleigh takes Bess 's B hand in his , discreetly .
ESS: Go to her .
RALEIGH: My Queen .
ELIZABETH: My friend . Still she does n't turn to him .
RALEIGH: No . You do n't need me to instruct you in your duty .
ELIZABETH: My duty ? Was it my father 's duty to murder my mother ? I would be
RALEIGH: Since when were you so afraid ? Now she looks at him .
ELIZABETH: Yes , I am afraid . I am always afraid .
RALEIGH: You fear your soul will be touched . Royalty is close to immortality . Kill a Queen - and queens are mortal .
ELIZABETH: You understand me well .
RALEIGH: We mortals have many weaknesses . We feel too much . Hurt too much . And all too soon , we die . But we do have the chance of love .
ELIZABETH: Do we ? Do we really ? She nods , her eyes still closed .
MARY: Your face tells me . It 's decided .
PAULET: Tomorrow morning . At eight .
MARY: Please do n't cry .
EXECUTIONER: Forgiveness , your grace .
MARY: I forgive you with all my heart , for now , I hope , you will make an end of all my troubles .
ELIZABETH: I want it stopped !
PHILIP: ( A sweet and Christian lady lies
WALSINGHAM: Philip of Spain is a God-fearing man . He can not make war without just cause . He sent the Jesuit to kill a Queen . But not you .
ELIZABETH: Not me !
WALSINGHAM: The Jesuit 's mission was to draw Mary Stuart into the murder plot . He knew I was reading her every letter . He waited until she wrote the words that sealed her guilt . Now Elizabeth gets it .
ELIZABETH: And I ordered her execution . I murdered God 's anointed Queen . And now God 's most dutiful son makes holy war to punish me .
WALSINGHAM: Forgive me , majesty . Let me go .
ELIZABETH: Yes Go
ARCHBISHOP: Exurge , domine et vindica causam tuam . Amen .
ELIZABETH: Boethius .
RALEIGH: The Consolation of Philosophy .
ELIZABETH: Thank you for coming at this late hour . She closes her book and puts it away .
RALEIGH: May the Lord God preserve England 's Queen .
ELIZABETH: The same God in whose name Philip wages his holy war . Philip is a ighteous man , and righteous men love to destroy . They burn whole worlds to make them pure , and leave behind - ashes .
RALEIGH: He 'll not burn England .
ELIZABETH: He may . His Armada is invincible , they say . If London falls , I fall . If England is lost , I am lost .
RALEIGH: Never !
ELIZABETH: Never ? It 's night . My thoughts turn dark . Do n't you ever think that one day , perhaps one day soon , you too will die ?
RALEIGH: The closer I come to death , the more I want to live . The hungrie I am for life .
RALEIGH: Why be afraid of tomorrow ? Today 's all we have , and all we know .
ELIZABETH: Today . Tonight .
RALEIGH: Now . They hold each other 's eyes .
ELIZABETH: I wish - But she ca n't say it .
RALEIGH: I 've never known a woman like you .
ELIZABETH: In some other time , in some othe world , could you have loved me ?
RALEIGH: I know only one world . In this world , I have loved you . Elizabeth smiles a small smile .
ELIZABETH: Then there 's something you could do for me - something I 've not known for a very long time - if you felt so inclined -
LIZABETH: Something not to be spoken of afterwards - to be forgotten - ut just for now -
ELIZABETH: A kiss ?
BESS: I 'll be quick . I have something to tell you . But I ask fo nothing . Is that understood ? You life is your own . Nothing will change .
RALEIGH: What is this , Bess ?
BESS: I 'm - Her hand touches her waist .
RALEIGH: You 're pregnant ?
BESS: No one knows . My plans are made . I shall ask the Queen fo permission to leave court . I shall live quietly in the country with - with my child . The Queen must know nothing .
ALEIGH: Where will you go ?
BESS: To my mother 's house .
BESS: I 'm a ward of the Queen . I ca n't court a man without he permission . I ca n't marry without her permission . As for having a child - Another official passes by .
RALEIGH: When were you planning to leave ?
BESS: As soon as I 'm allowed .
RALEIGH: Am I not to see you again ? What 's to become of the child ? Bess -
BESS: Hush ! We 've no choice . You know it as well as I do .
RALEIGH: All I know is nothing 's as it should be .
BESS: Please listen . You once said to me , ` Whatever I have to give , ask and it 's yours . ' Do you remember ?
RALEIGH: Of course I remember .
BESS: I ask that you forget me . Go to your ship . Do your duty . Forget me .
RALEIGH: Oh , Bess
MARGARET: Bess ! We 're summoned .
ESS: I 'm coming . Goodbye . She runs after the ladies .
ELIZABETH: Air ! I must have air ! Her servants hurry in , and open the window .
RALEIGH: and with all my worldly goods H I thee endow . e places the ring on her left thumb .
ELIZABETH: This Spanish Armada is at sea carrying an army of ten thousand men . The Duke of Parma has fifteen thousand men on the French coast .
WALSINGHAM: They plan to cross the Channel in arges , under the protection of the Spanish fleet , and sail up the Thames .
WALSINGHAM: That is so .
ELIZABETH: Our forces defend the Thames
HATTON: We have three , possibly fou thousand , majesty .
WALSINGHAM: If the Spanish fleet reaches Calais in strength , the combined armies will be beyond our powe to resist .
LIZABETH: Therefore , the Spanish fleet must not reach Calais .
HOWARD: Majesty , this vast Armada will surely smash through our naval defences . We must be prepared fo the worst .
WALSINGHAM: How did you know about the numbers of the Dutch barges , majesty ? I do n't recall supplying you with that information .
ELIZABETH: You may observe , Walsingham , that I do n't see my way with only one eye . Nor do I hop along on only one leg . Why then would I rely on only one source of information ?
LIZABETH: Where 's Bess ?
ELIZABETH: Where is she ?
ELIZABETH: Bess ! Bess Throckmorton ! Bess comes running from the far end .
BESS: Here , my lady !
ELIZABETH: Tell me ! Is it true ? Are you married ? Are you with child ? Are you WITH CHILD ? Bess stands before her with her head bowed .
BESS: Yes , my lady .
ELIZABETH: You traitress ! You dare to have secrets from me ! I am your Queen ! You ask my permission before you ut - before you marry - before you breed ! My bitches wear my collars ! Do you hear me ? How dare you be with child ! Walsingham comes hobbling up .
WALSINGHAM: Majesty , please ! Dignity - mercy -
ELIZABETH: This is no time for mercy ! That 's what you said to me . I do n't forget . But you showed mercy , Walsingham ! Go to your traito other , and leave me to my usiness !
ELIZABETH: Is it his child ? Tell me ! Say it ! Is the child his ? Tell me ! Say it ! Is it his ?
BESS: Yes , my lady . It is - my husband 's child .
RALEIGH: This is not the Queen I love and serve .
ELIZABETH: This gentleman has seduced a lady under my care . This lady has married without my consent . These are offences punishable by law . Arrest him .
ELIZABETH: The fall of an empire , you told me . Did you mean the English empire ? Because by God , England will not fall while I am Queen ! If that 's your prophecy , sir , prophesy again !
DEE: You want me to tell your majesty only what your majesty chooses to hear ?
ELIZABETH: I will not be a toy of the fates ! Have I not faced an assassin 's ullet and lived ?
DEE: The forces that shape the world are greater than all of us , majesty . How can I promise you that they 'll conspire in you favour , even though you are the Queen ? But this much I know . When the storm breaks , each man acts in accordance with his own nature . Some are dumb with terror . Some flee . Some hide . And some spread their wings like eagles and soar on the wind .
ELIZABETH: You 're a wise man , Dr Dee .
DEE: And you , madam , are a very great lady .
ELIZABETH: My lords , I can offer you no words of comfort .
RALEIGH: What news ? Is the fleet at sea ?
SERVANT: Yes , sir . May God preserve them .
RALEIGH: What news ?
SERVANT: The Spanish are off Portland .
RALEIGH: And the fleet ?
SERVANT: Still at Plymouth , joined by
RALEIGH: All but me .
ELIZABETH: Labourers are to leave the fields and take up arms . The harvest must wait .
PHILIP: Tu es Deus qui facis mirabilia solus . Notam fecisti in gentibus virtutem tuam
RALEIGH: Tell the Queen I will join my
ELIZABETH: Are our ships at sea ? Has the fleet left Plymouth ? That ca n't e so hard to know .
HATTON: The enemy continues to advance .
DRAKE: We must attack ! What choice do we have ?
HOWARD: We 're decisively outgunned , Drake . We are losing too many
DRAKE: There has to be a way of getting inside this crescent formation .
RALEIGH: Our ships may be smaller but
HOWARD: I tell you , we 're out-gunned . Do you want to lose the whole fleet ?
RALEIGH: Break their formation and we have
HOWARD: We ca n't get near them .
WALSINGHAM: The Spanish are barely a day away , majesty .
HATTON: t would be wise to withdraw to safer ground .
WALSINGHAM: I beg you to appreciate the gravity of the situation , majesty . There is very little time . Elizabeth turns on him , calm and defiant .
ELIZABETH: Then we must act .
ELIZABETH: My loving people ! We see the sails of the enemy approaching . We hear the Spanish guns over the water .
ELIZABETH: While we stand together no invader shall pass . Let them come with all the armies of Hell , they will not pass . The crowd gives another mighty cheer .
SOLDIERS: Aye !
SPANISH OFFICER: ( If we do n't drop anchor , we 'll
DRAKE: They 've dropped anchor . These Spanish monsters ca n't handle ou English seas .
RALEIGH: We have the wind in our favour . Do we go ?
DRAKE: We go .
HATTON: He was told not to risk any more ships of the fleet . Elizabeth is distant from the general hubbub .
WALSINGHAM: How many Spanish ships are urning ? Hatton murmurs a figure .
ELIZABETH: One empire will rise , and one will fall
RALEIGH: How many ships are burning ?
DRAKE: Four .
RALEIGH: Not enough .
ELIZABETH: Francis . My old friend .
AGENT 3: I come from your brother . Now we see who he speaks to William .
WILLIAM: What does he want ?
AGENT 3: He asks your forgiveness .
WILLIAM: My forgiveness ?
WALSINGHAM: I have served your majesty - in all things
ELIZABETH: I know it , old friend . Do n't leave me now . Walsingham 's eyes open . A weak smile .
WALSINGHAM: Y ou do n't need me any more . Permission - to go -
ELIZABETH: You always did do as you pleased , whether I wanted it or not . I 've no doubt you 'll do as you please now .
OYAL SERVANT: Her majesty the Queen !
ELIZABETH: When was the birth ?
RALEIGH: F our nights ago .
ELIZABETH: The mother is well ?
RALEIGH: Thank God .
ELIZABETH: And the child ?
RALEIGH: My son is well . Now for the first time she looks at the baby .
ELIZABETH: Your Elizabeth has a child . You must be proud .
RALEIGH: Yes .
ELIZABETH: And fulfilled ?
RALEIGH: As any man can be .
ELIZABETH: And do you still dream of you shining city , your New World ?

BRILL: Okay .
DEAN: Wait .
BRILL: You drive a black BMW , license plate SRK1339 ?
DEAN: Yeah .
BRILL: I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away .
DEAN: What is that ?
BRILL: It 's a SAT-tracker .
DEAN: I do n't know what that means .
BRILL: Like a LowJack , but two generations ahead of what the police use . It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz .
DEAN: I do n't know what that means .
BRILL: 230 Giga-Hertz . They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks .
DEAN: I do n't know what that means .
BRILL: It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch .
DEAN: Why are they after me ?
BRILL: If I knew , they 'd be after me . Which they probably are right now . 'Bye .
DEAN: Wait . What do I do ?
BRILL: Pal , you 're cooked . It 's over . What you did , who you werethat 's done . I 'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow .
DEAN: Why do n't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want ?
BRILL: They 're spooks .
DEAN: I do n't know what that
BRILL: Exposure . They ca n't have it . They wan na learn what you know and then deal with it .
DEAN: I do n't know anything .
BRILL: No shit .
DEAN: What am I gon na do ? ! I mean , like , for the rest of my life ? !
BRILL: Hey , if you live another week I 'll e impressed .
DEAN: What if

DEAN: What if I find out what they 're after . You know these people , I do n't .
BRILL: And you wo n't . Now move
DEAN: I 'll pay you .
BRILL: They froze your accounts . Get outa my way .
DEAN: I 've got a hundred-thousand dollars in jewelry in a safe-deposit box under a third party name . BRILL looks at the ground . Torn .
BRILL: If you find something , chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville . It 's South of Salisbury . And take this . And with that , he 's gone .
DEAN: I swear to God I 'll shoot .
HICKS: I do n't fuckin ' believe this ! 301 to all units . Everyone out ! Now ! We 'll take him at the hospital .
DEAN: Tell him to stop the ambulance .
PARAMEDIC: Whoa there , fella . Just take it easy .
DEAN: Tell him to stop the ambulance .
PARAMEDIC: Now you 're a little shaken up , but we 're gon na get you on your feet in
DEAN: Thank you .
HICKS: He 's clever . He had help .
REYNOLDS: He 's clever ? He had help ? Oh .
HICKS: Sir
REYNOLDS: No , no , I 'm sorry . I did n't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland .
HICKS: I just meant
REYNOLDS: I do n't care if he 's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his lap . I want the tape and I want him . Now is
WAITER: Puffed cheese ?
REYNOLDS: No thank you .
WAITER: I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with
REYNOLDS: Do I look like I want a tiny pizza ?
WAITER: No .
REYNOLDS: Then let 's assume I do n't .
WAITER: Yes sir . The WAITER goes back inside .
REYNOLDS: Now is that clear ?
WAITER: Yes sir .
DEAN: Rachel ?
JERRY: Christ !
DEAN: Ssh !
JERRY: Bobby
DEAN: It 's the NSA . They 're the ones doing this .
JERRY: Bobby
DEAN: The NSA 's doing this 'cause they think I have something . And they killed
JERRY: Calm down .
DEAN: They killed Rachel .
JERRY: Rachel 's dead ?
DEAN: Yes .
JERRY: Jesus .
DEAN: My stuff 's all over her apartment .
JERRY: Bobby
DEAN: They 're framing me .
JERRY: Why would they
DEAN: I do n't know . I mean
JERRY: Why would the NSA
DEAN: I do n't know !
JERRY: You 're tired .
DEAN: Jerry
JERRY: Listen to me .

STACY: Robert
DEAN: Listen to me . The house is bugged . So we got ta be quiet , okay ?
STACY: Yes .
DEAN: Has anyone been by ? Police ? FBI ?
STACY: Just reporters .
DEAN: I wish you 'd gone to your parents like I asked you .
STACY: This is my house . Nobody 's kicking me out of my house . I picked those drapes .
DEAN: I do n't think anybody wants the drapes , Stacy , I think the drapes are okay .
STACY: What happened to your head ?
DEAN: I was in a car chase and a small explosion . Now listen to me The NSA is behind this . They think that guy I told you about , Daniel Zavitz , they think Zavitz gave me a tape o computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them . So they 're doing all these things u > electronically . The bank records , the surveillance . They 're the ones who broke into the house . Now I know there 's no reason to believe me . But I love you . And I love ou son . So just believe me anyway . Please .
STACY: Does that hurt ?
DEAN: Wellyeah .
STACY: Good .
DEAN: Stacy
STACY: I told you they could do this . I u > told you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another
DEAN: StacyStacymaybe now is n't the est time for the I-Told-You-So speech . She kisses him again .
STACY: I 'm sorry I did n't believe you .
DEAN: That 's okay .
STACY: I opened the present you got me from Harrison 's .
DEAN: You opened the thing ?
STACY: The lingerie .
DEAN: That was for Christmas .
STACY: I was missing you .
DEAN: You 're as bad as Eric . I 've got an entire family of people who root through

DRIVER: 504 to 501 . Rover 's fleeing west on Sutton . Driver appeared male !
TRACY: Eric ? ERIC looks up
ERIC: Dad !
DEAN: Do I know you ?
ERIC: Where 've you been ?
DEAN: Having an adventure . I ca n't tell you about it right now , but I 'll tell you about it soon .
ERIC: Are you and mom getting a divorce ?
DEAN: No . We 're never getting a divorce . We were having a fight . It happens sometimes .
ERIC: Who won the fight ?
DEAN: Men do n't win fights with women , son , I 'll tell you about that sometime , too . In the meantime , I 've got a question for you , and it 's incredibly important that you tell me the truth . Under no circumstances will I be angry with you . This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card . Ready ?
ERIC: Yeah .
DEAN: Did you take anythinganything at allout of those Christmas bags I ought home last week .
DYLAN: Hey , Mr. D. , what 's happenin ' ?
DEAN: Dylan , I was just asking Eric if
DYLAN: Oh , God , I knew it was stupid , I u > knew we 'd get caught . But the Gameboy was just sitting there . Right on top of the bag . Yes . Yes . We took the GameBoy out of the bag , ut with every intention of putting it back .
DEAN: You 're a tough nut to crack , Dylan .
DYLAN: It was broken when we found it , I swear . I tried fixing it for you . I even put in new batteries . The screen scrambles whenever you oot up . I 'd try to get your money ack .
BRILL: Get dressed . We 're leaving .
DEAN: You could knock on the door , you know , and I 'd open it .
BRILL: Move it .
DEAN: And you were worried about me . That 's nice , I appreciate
BRILL: I was worried about my hundred and twenty ' K ' .
DEAN: We said a hundred .
BRILL: The price rises with the temperature and right now you 're smokin ' . But you 're right , you should shop around and get the best price . I 'll just let you out here .
DEAN: One-twenty . BRILL checks the rear-view mirror .
BRILL: Did you call anyone ?
DEAN: What do you mean ?
BRILL: I mean did you call anyone .
DEAN: Look , my wife is understandably
BRILL: Jesus !
DEAN: I called my wife !
BRILL: What 'd I tell you ?
DEAN: I did n't use my name .
BRILL: What 'd I tell you ?
DEAN: I called from a payphone !
BRILL: What 'd I tell you ?
DEAN: You told me no calls .
BRILL: I told you no calls .
DEAN: Sorry .
BRILL: You do n't get it . They go through your phone records . They fuckin ' monitor everyone you called in the last
DEAN: I did n't use my name .
BRILL: Oh , I 'll bet that threw 'em off the scent . I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice !
DEAN: I do n't hear anything . Maybe you 're wrong . BRILL is staring upward
BRILL: A hundred and fifty .
DEAN: How do you know so much ?
BRILL: None of your business .
DEAN: You used to work for 'em , did n't you ?
BRILL: I was a traffic analyst .
DEAN: How 'd you get around the tap orders ?
BRILL: They can tap anything as along as it 's an airwave intercept . Cellulars and pagers your kid can do . Hard-line calls we 'd pick off the elays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs . We 'd suck in everything . All foreign , most domestic . Domestic was my group . Druggies , adicals , loud-mouths . Anyone we wanted .
DEAN: How 'd you have the manpower to
BRILL: Meade has 18 underground acres of computers . They scan every < /u phonecall for target words like `` bomb '' or `` President '' . We red-flag phone numbers or voice printswhatever we wanted . When the computers found something , it was bounced to comparative analysis .
DEAN: Jesus .
BRILL: That was twenty years ago . With digital ? They can suck a salt grain off a beach .
DEAN: Why 'd you leave ?
BRILL: It was '72 . I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid 's class schedule . So I sold my story to Ramparts and split .
DEAN: They come after you ?
BRILL: Wellthere 'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me . So they uined my records and made sure I 'd never hold a real job again .
DEAN: Looks like Detroit .
BRILL: Welcome to Santa 's Workshop .
DEAN: It really is . Did you find anything ?
BRILL: Yeah . Take a walk with me .
DEAN: Yeah .
BRILL: The NSA killed him .
DEAN: Jesus . Do you have proof ?
BRILL: Well , actually , you have proof . Could you walk a little faster please .
DEAN: What 's going on ?
BRILL: They 're here .
DEAN: Who ?
BRILL: Them .
DEAN: Where ?
BRILL: Here ?
DEAN: Here ? !
BRILL: In the warehouse . They 're hiding in a duct on the third floor . When we go back inside , they 're gon na kill us . When they notice that we 're moving toward the car , they 'll come unning out of the building .
DEAN: 'Kay , well , could you walk faster , please .
JONES: Move it .
BRILL: Empty 'em 'till they 're almost flat . And turn your head . There might be some debris flying your way .
DEAN: Why ?
BRILL: They should n't have come without calling first .
DEAN: Back at the warehouse .
BRILL: You sure ?
DEAN: You 're driving .
BRILL: Those are Feds .
DEAN: I did n't see a warrant . Did you see a warrant ?
BRILL: Think we let out enough air ?
DEAN: Oh my God
BRILL: We lost 'em .
DEAN: That was n't so hard .
BRILL: Fuckin-A .
DEAN: Let 's not do the tire thing anymore , okay ?
BRILL: Yeah , I can see where that 'd He stops talking .
DEAN: Tell me about it . The road straightens . Up ahead , a tunnel .
BRILL: Drive .
DEAN: We 're not gon na hurt you .
BRILL: Drive .
DEAN: Tell him we 're not gon na hurt him .
BRILL: Drive or I 'll blow your fuckin ' head off .
DEAN: No he wo n't .
BRILL: Goddammit
DEAN: We 're honest people and we need your help . I 'll give you two- hundred dollars if you
BRILL: Drive the damn car !
HICKS: We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill 's studio . One was Dean 's . The other , we elieve , belongs to Brill .
REYNOLDS: We believe ?
HICKS: Wellhis real name 's Edward Lyle .
REYNOLDS: Lyle ? !
HICKS: Yes sir .
REYNOLDS: You 're kidding me .
HICKS: No sir .
REYNOLDS: Dean 's with Lyle .
HICKS: And they have the video . That 's confirmed .
REYNOLDS: So they know everything .
HICKS: If they 've looked at the video .
REYNOLDS: Oh , let 's assume that they have .
HICKS: If he 's with Lyle it means he 's got esources .
REYNOLDS: Resources , that 's a good point . He 's got resources . All we 've got is a six-hundred billion dollar < /i
BRILL: Listen to you , `` directly '' . You 're not gon na get near the News Department . And if you did , it 'd never get on the air . Time-Life uried the Zapruder film for 15 years .
DEAN: What about newspapers and magazines ?
BRILL: Same thing ?
DEAN: So what do we do now ?
BRILL: I was thinkin ' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits .
DEAN: What if we do a mailing to Congressmen .
BRILL: It 'd never get through . All packages are screened , x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives . You did n't like my `` give-me-my- money '' idea ?
DEAN: What if we hand deliver to thei homes or office ?
BRILL: The area 's wired for surveillance , they 'll be looking for those moves .
DEAN: Well how do I know what they 're
DEAN: What if we put it on the internet ?
BRILL: Have you seen how fuckin ' slow the net is ? It 'd take ten minutes to unload enough video so that people know what they 're seeing , and it 'd take the NSA maybe 40 seconds to see it coming down and shut down the access .
DEAN: Listen
BRILL: Nah , they 'd shut down the pin number .
DEAN: What if
BRILL: If they could n't do that , they 'd shut down the whole system , all the elays .
DEAN: What if
BRILL: They 've done it before . Takes maybe two minutes .
DEAN: What if
BRILL: What if what ?
DEAN: What if we just fucked with 'em ?
BRILL: How ?
DEAN: Same way they did with you and me . We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us .
BRILL: Reynolds .
DEAN: No .
BRILL: Who ?
DEAN: We 'll play the NSA 's game only we 'll play it badly .
BRILL: We 'll have to re-stock some basics .
DEAN: I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone . Beyond that
BRILL: Shit .
DEAN: Unbelievable .
BRILL: All from a hundred dollar scanne at Radio Shack . But it 's time fo usiness .
DEAN: What are you dialing ?
BRILL: AmeriTech 's data-base . There 's Albert 's D.C. office address and his phone 's identity code . Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we 've got ?
SENATOR ALBERT: Not 'till later tonight . We 're going to the campus now . I 'll call you after I 've checked in . I love you too , dear .

SENATOR ALBERT: Well get somebody down here today . I do n't know what the hell this is all about .
DEAN: He 's going into the payphone outside the restaurant . It 's a Cambridge company called Baudmore .
BRILL: Got it .
PATRICK: Is Jerry Delsano in ?
BRILL: Who 's calling ?
PATRICK: It 's Pat Cary . I work for Senato Sam Albert and I was given Jerry 's name .
BRILL: Jerry 's on vacation 'till Monday . I can give him the message when he gets back . That was Patrick and the last name
PATRICK: The thing isit really ca n't wait .
BRILL: My name 's Neil . Maybe I can help you .
SENATOR ALBERT: Well then who can ?
BRILL: Ah , sir , you know , it 's not for me to say .
SENATOR ALBERT: What do you mean ? Who can buy this kind of equipment .
BRILL: The thing is , Senator , and I do n't want to get in the middle of nothing , but
SENATOR ALBERT: What are you saying ?
BRILL: Most of this stuff 's only available to law enforcement .
SENATOR ALBERT: Law enforcement ?
BRILL: FBI , CIA , NSA , local cops .
SENATOR ALBERT: Are you sure about this ?
BRILL: I yanked this off your RV . It 's a Global Positioning Tracker .
SENATOR ALBERT: Oh my God .
BRILL: Tracks your location to the inch and works directly withyou know
SENATOR ALBERT: With what ?
BRILL: With spy satellites . I do n't like saying these things Senator
SENATOR ALBERT: Neil , thank you for your help .
BRILL: Anytime . PATRICK escorts BRILL out of the RV .
SENATOR ALBERT: This is Sam Albert . Put me through to Langley . Dick Marshal 's office .
BRILL: Albert 's primed . We 'll let him stew for a day and then drop the tape . BRILL looks over at the WELL-DRESSED MAN .

JONES: Fuck
SHAFFER: I got the same call at the Bureau . He 's upset .
REYNOLDS: About what ?
MARSHAL: About what ? Do I look stupid ?
REYNOLDS: Ken
MARSHAL: Does Shaffer look stupid to you ?
SHAFFER: We 're not stupid , Reynolds .
MARSHAL: The fuck do you have goin ' on with Sam Albert ?
SHAFFER: This guy 's carrying the flag fo the damn terrorism bill . You think this is the best time to piss him off ?
MARSHAL: You have any idea what kind of position this
SHAFFER: He 's carrying the damn flag .
REYNOLDS: We 're not doing anything with Sam Albert .
MARSHAL: He thinks we 're stupid .
SHAFFER: He found an NSA SAT tracker on his motor home today .
REYNOLDS: It 's not ours .
MARSHAL: It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies .
SHAFFER: I do n't know what 's going on , but if you people have tripped ove your own asshole again , you 're not gon na get any help from us . It 's ending at your doorstep .
REYNOLDS: What about
HICKS: Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body .
REYNOLDS: What about the tape ?
HICKS: We think it was on Brill . If it was , it 's destroyed now .
REYNOLDS: And if it was n't ?
PRIEST: The Lord said I leave you peace , my peace I leave you . Let us now , in the spirit of these holidays , turn to our neighbors and offe them a sign of peace .

PRIEST: Let us now offer up thanks to the Lord our God in the words ou Father gave us .
CONGREGATION: Our Father , who art in Heaven , hallow 'd be thy name
DEAN: I 've re-routed the call . They ca n't trace it .
STACY: Are you sure you 're safe ?
DEAN: Yeah .
TECHNICIAN: Got it !
REYNOLDS: Yeah .
HICKS: Found him . Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago . He 's stationary .
REYNOLDS: Do you have visual ?
HICKS: Not yet . He 's near `` M '' and 34th . I 've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now . A residential building . Twelve units .
REYNOLDS: What 's your ETA ?
HICKS: Three minutes . We 're going in light . Myself and two others . Everyone else is held back in reserve .
REYNOLDS: He walked right up to me in church . At the holiest time of the wear . He approached me in a sanctified place . Kill him now .

ALBERT: I understand we have a problem .

CHRISTA: Senator , there were some things I could n't tell you over the phone .
ALBERT: What kinds of things ?
PATRICK: Mr. Dean has a video tape from the hotel room in Boston .
ALBERT: I see .
DEAN: It 's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator .
ALBERT: I do n't know what that means .
DEAN: Me neither , but the upshot is I 've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it does n't look good .
ALBERT: Sohow much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life ?
DEAN: I do n't want any money . And believe me , I have no interest in ruining your life . I 'm not interested in this tape .
ALBERT: You 're not .
PATRICK: Then what do you want from the Senator ?
DEAN: I want him to look at a different tape . People have been killed . Lives have been ruined . Senator , I want you to look at this . And I want you to bring the fury of God himself upon this man . DEAN tosses the chip to ALBERT .
REYNOLDS: Yeah .
FBI AGENT: John Reynolds ?
REYNOLDS: What the hell
FBI AGENT: You 're under arrest . You have the ight to remain silent . Anything you say
ERIC: These guys are always making speeches .
STACY: It 's an important speech , Eric . There 's gon na be a vote today .
SENATOR ALBERT: Today we face a threat to that creed . Certain individuals in ou intelligence community believe they 're entitled to examine lives in minute detail , and claim to do it in the name of the common good .
ERIC: If they 're voting today , has n't everyone pretty much made up thei minds .
STACY: Actually , this man appears to have changed his mind dramatically .
ERIC: Why ?
STACY: Is it over ?
DEAN: It 's over .

DEAN: Yeah . I wish you could 've met
STACY: Who ?
DEAN: A friend of mine . I do n't know his eal name . He 's dead now .
STACY: You did good .
ALBERT: I 've lived through the dark ages of Hoover 's Watch-List and McCarthy 's Witch Hunts - men who used moral crusades , fired by fear , to lay waste to our freedoms .
STACY: C'mon upstairs . I 've got a Christmas present from Harrison 's I want to show you .
ALBERT: Our intelligence communities presently monitor our phones , computers , financial transactions , medical historiesall this and more . Some of you may say , `` Fine . I 'm not a criminal and I have nothing to hide . '' Well God forbid we ever edge to tyranny . God forbid George Orwell 's version of America ecomes a reality . We are that close . ALBERT 's speech continues as we
JAN: There 's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me .
HANA: I 'm not sewing anything else .

MARY: Well , we ca n't hardly leave him . Do you mean leave him ? We ca n't .
HANA: I must be a curse . Anybody who loves me , anybody who gets close to me - or I must be cursed . Which is it ?
OLIVER: It 's not over everywhere . I did n't mean literally .
HANA: When he dies I 'll catch up .
OLIVER: It 's not safe here . The whole country 's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what . It 's madness . I ca n't allow it . You 're not , this is natural - it 's shock . For all of us . Hana -
HANA: I need morphine . A lot . And a pistol .
OLIVER: And what if he really is a spy ?
HANA: He ca n't even move .
OLIVER: If anything happened to you I 'd neve forgive myself .
HANA: Up there .
THE PATIENT: There was a Prince , who was dying , and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills . Am I that Prince ? Hana laughs .
HANA: Because you 're leaning ? No , you 're just on an angle . You 're too heavy !
D'AGOSTINO: Thirsty ?
MADOX: What 's this ?

ALMÁSY: Which means we 're in the wrong place .
D'AGOSTINO: Why ?
ALMÁSY: Would you stockpile water near to an Oasis ? There ca n't be a natural spring within fifty miles of here .
FOUAD: Or they did n't know of one .
BERMANN: So , it may not be Zerzura , still incredible .
D'AGOSTINO: A pottery hill !

ALMÁSY: Thank you .
KATHARINE: I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives .
ALMÁSY: A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it . Big car , slow car , chauffeur-driven car , still a car .
CLIFTON: A broken car ?
ALMÁSY: Still a car .
CLIFFTON: Not much use , though .
KATHARINE: Love ? Romantic love , platonic love , filial love - ? Quite different things , surely ?
CLIFTON: Uxoriousness - that 's my favorite kind of love . Excessive love of one 's wife .
ALMÁSY: There you have me .
THE PATIENT: What was all the banging ? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army ?
HANA: I was repairing the stairs . I found a library and the books were very useful .
THE PATIENT: Before you find too many uses for these ooks would you read some to me ?
HANA: I think they 're all in Italian , but I 'll look , yes . What about your own book ?
THE PATIENT: My book ? The Herodotus ? Yes , we can read him .
HANA: Oh - I 've found plums . We have plums in the orchard . We have an orchard !
THE PATIENT: Thank you .
HANA: Water ! You hear it , too , do n't you !
FOUAD: European , I think , with guides .
CLIFTON: How do you know ?
MADOX: Yes , and I think I know who this is .
ALMÁSY: Yes , I think a sailor can call himself an explorer , ca n't he ? Or should Columbus have swum to America ?
MADOX: I think you know all of us , except fo Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton , who 've ecently come out from England .
CLIFTON: Apprentices .
MADOX: This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes .
KATHARINE: Hello .
MADOX: Anyway , my friend here has a new theory - that Zerzura does n't exist . So we may all e chasing windmills . Have some food .
KATHARINE: Is n't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms ?
ALMÁSY: What kind of fossils ?
KATHARINE: I ca n't sing . ut I can tell a story . I might need a prompt . Do you have you Herodotus ? I 've noticed you carry it
ALMÁSY: I 'm sorry - what have you noticed ?
MADOX: Your book . Your Herodotus ! Almásy looks uncomfortable .
KATHARINE: It does n't matter . Really . I think I can muddle through . Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges . King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife - One day he said to Gyges , the son of somebody , anyway - his favorite warrior -
ALMÁSY: Daskylus
KATHARINE: Yes , thank you , Gyges , son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I do n't think you elieve me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is . And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove eyond dispute that she was fairest of all women . Do you all know this story ?
HANA: I will hide you in the room where we sleep , said Candaules . She stumbles over the word .
THE PATIENT: Candaules
HANA: Candaulesyou 're laughing at me .
THE PATIENT: I 'm not laughing at you . Go on , please .
HANA: When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room , and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
KATHARINE: And that evening , it 's exactly as the King had told him , she goes to the chai and removes her clothes , one by one , until she stand naked in full view of Gyges . And indeed she was more lovely than he could have imagined .
CLIFTON: Off with his head !
KATHERINE: # NAME ? death for gazing on that which you should not , or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his place .
MADOX: And let that be a lesson to you !
HANA: Are you asleep ?
THE PATIENT: Yes . Dropping off .
MADOX: What did you think you were doing in his tent ?
ALMÁSY: Looking for the fossils . Why should we wait until we 're in London ? This girl was probably twelve years old .
MADOX: You should n't go into another man 's tent . It 's inexcusable .
ALMÁSY: Her hands and feet were tied .
MADOX: What did you do ?
ALMÁSY: I looked at them . They 're shrubs , small trees . Exquisite . And fossilized , rock hard . He walks away to the nose of the plane .
MADOX: I was talking about the girl .
ALMÁSY: Cut the ropes . I left a note , on his blanket . At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot . The Girl would n't leave , of course . Her father had sold he for a camel .
HANA: I should try and move your bed . I want you to be able to see the view . It 's good , it 's a view from a monastery .
THE PATIENT: I can already see .
HANA: How ? How can you see anything ?
THE PATIENT: Not the window - I ca n't bear the light anyway - no , I can see all the way to the desert . I 've found the lost fossils .
HANA: I 'm turning you .
THE PATIENT: Zerzura , the White City of Acacias , the Oasis of Little Birds . As me about the scent of acacia - it 's in this room . I can smell it . The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth . I can taste it . I 'm chewing the mint . Is there sand in my eyes ? Are you cleaning sand from my ears ?
HANA: No sand . That 's your drugs speaking .
THE PATIENT: I can see my wife in that view .
HANA: Are you remembering more ?
THE PATIENT: Could I have a cigarette ?
HANA: Are you crazy ?
THE PATIENT: Why are you so determined to keep me alive ?
HANA: Because I 'm a nurse .
BOY: Okay .
HANA: Your leg will be fine . A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces .
BOY: You 're the prettiest girl I ever saw .
HANNA: I do n't think so .
BOY: Would you kiss me ?
HANA: No , I 'll get you some tea . Wait till you 're in Naples . You 'll find a girl there .
BOY: Just kiss me . It would mean such a lot to me .
HANA: Would it ? She kisses him , very softly , on the lips .
BOY: Thank you .
HANA: Very funny . Go to sleep .
MARY: Do n't ask .
HANA: Where are we going ? I do n't want to be kissing in a crowd . I have six hours .
STUART: Whoa - give me a chance !
HANA: Sorry . I took a Benzedrine .
STUART: I 've got a surprise . A boat ! We can go to Capri . It 's got a cabin , it 's private .
HANA: I 'd like to spend a night with you in a bed .
STUART: We can do that when we 're very very old .
CARAVAGGIO: Buon ' Giorno ! Hana turns , startled and suspicious .
HANA: What do you want ?
CARAVAGGIO: I met your friend Mary . She said I should stop and see if you were okay . Apparently we 're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal . Cabot , north of Laurier . Bonjour .
HANA: Bonjour .
CARAVAGGIO: I 'd like to take credit , but it 's from Mary . My name 's David Caravaggio , ut nobody ever called me David . Caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on .
HANA: You were in Africa ?
CARAVAGGIO: Yeah , for a while .
HANA: So was my Patient .
CARAVAGGIO: I 'd like to stay . That 's the long and short of it . I mean , you know blah-blah if it 's convenient , if there 's room lah-blah-blah . I have to do some work here -I speak the language . There are Partisans to be -
#NAME?: relieve them of their weapons , you know - while we hug . I was a thief , so they think I 'd be good at that .
HANA: So you can shoot a pistol ?
CARAVAGGIO: No .
HANA: If you said yes I would have had a eason . You should let me redress those bandages . Before you go .
CARAVAGGIO: I 'm okay . Look , it 's a big house . We need n't disturb each other . I can shoot a pistol ! I 'll sleep in the stables . I do n't care where I sleep . I do n't sleep .
HANA: Because we 're fine here . I do n't know what Mary told you about me , but I do n't need company , I do n't need to be looked at .
CARAVAGGIO: Fine . I 'm not looking .
HANA: There 's a man downstairs . He ought us eggs . He might stay .
THE PATIENT: Why ? Can he lay eggs ?
HANA: He 's Canadian .
THE PATIENT: Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place ? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you ?
HANA: He need n't disturb you .
THE PATIENT: Me ? He ca n't . I 'm already disturbed .
HANA: He wo n't disturb us then . I think he 's after morphine . There 's a war . Where you come from ecomes important . And besides - we 're vulnerable here . I keep hearing noises in the night . Voices .
ALMÁSY: How much did you pay ?
KATHARINE: Hello ! Good morning .
ALMÁSY: They do n't see foreign women in this market . How much did you pay ?
KATHARINE: Seven pounds , eight , I suppose . Why ?
ALMÁSY: Which stall ?
KATHARINE: Excuse me ?
ALMÁSY: You 've been cheated , do n't worry , we 'll take it back .
KATHARINE: I do n't want to go back .
ALMÁSY: This is not worth eight pounds , Mrs. Clifton .
KATHARINE: I do n't care to bargain .
ALMÁSY: That insults them .
KATHARINE: I do n't believe that . I think you are insulted by me , somehow . You 're a foreigner too , are n't you , here , in this market ?
ALMÁSY: I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this . I apologize if I appear abrupt . I am rusty at social graces . How do you find Cairo ? Did you visit the Pyramids ?
KATHARINE: Excuse me .
CLIFTON: Gentlemen , good evening ! He sits down . Madox hails the waiter .
D'AGOSTINO: How is your charming wife ?
CLIFTON: Uh , marvelous . She 's in love with the hotel plumbing . She 's either in the swimming pool - she swims fo hours , she 's a fish , quite incredible - or she 's in the bath . Actually , she 's just outside . Chaps Only in the Long Bar .
MADOX: Of course . Well , we should all go out onto the terrace .
CLIFTON: Oh no , really . She has her book .
MADOX: I wo n't hear of it . None of us will .
KATHARINE: Not at all . I was thoroughly enjoying by book . Please . Signor D'Agostino , Herr Bermann .
CLIFTON: The team is in mourning , darling .
KATHARINE: Oh really ?
MADOX: I 'm afraid we 're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition .
KATHARINE: How awful . What will you do ?
MADOX: A more modest expedition , or even wait a year . Remind our families we still exist .
CLIFTON: Good heavens , are you married , Madox ?
MADOX: Very much so . We are all , save my friend here .
CLIFTON: I feel much better , do n't you darling ? We were feeling rather self-conscious . Let 's toast , then . To absent wives .
D'AGOSTINO: And present ones .
KATHARINE: And future ones .
ALMÁSY: Excuse me ?
KATHARINE: After the market , you followed me to the hotel .
ALMÁSY: I was concerned . As I said , women in that part of Cairo , a European women , I felt obliged to .
KATHARINE: You felt obliged to .
ALMÁSY: As the wife of one of our party .
KATHARINE: So why follow me ? Escort me , by all means . Following me is predatory , is n't it ?
CLIFTON: I was just saying , I 'm going to cable Downing Street , see if I ca n't stir up a few shillings - Katharine 's mothe and the PM 's wife are best -
KATHARINE: Darling , for goodness ' sake !
CLIFTON: Well , she is !
CARAVAGGIO: Hello .
THE PATIENT: Finally ! So you 're ou Canadian pickpocket ? He goes to help Hana , they work as he talks .
CARAVAGGIO: Thief , I think , is more accurate .
THE PATIENT: I understand you were in Africa . Whereabouts ?
CARAVAGGIO: Oh , all over .
THE PATIENT: All over ? I kept trying to cove a very modest portion and still failed . Are you leaving us ? Now 's ou opportunity to swap war wounds .
HANA: Then I 'm definitely going . And she exits . The men consider her .
CARAVAGGIO: Does she have war wounds ?
THE PATIENT: I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her .
CARAVAGGIO: Are you planning to be the exception ?
THE PATIENT: Me ? You 've got the wrong end of the stick , old boy . So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name .
CARAVAGGIO: And you 've forgotten yours .
THE PATIENT: I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name .
CARAVAGGIO: I told her you can forget everything ut you never forget your name .
OFFICER: Do you remember where you were born ?
THE PATIENT: Am I being interrogated ? You should be trying to trick me . Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur . Or Buckingham Palace . About Marmite - I was addicted . Or make me speak German , which I can , by the way .
OFFICER: Why ? Are you German ?
THE PATIENT: No .
OFFICER: How do you know you 're not German if you do n't remember anything ?
THE PATIENT: You tell me . I remember a lot of things . I remember a garden , plunging down to the sea - the Devil 's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the ottom , right on the shore , nothing etween you and France .
OFFICER: This was your garden ?
THE PATIENT: Or my wife 's .
OFFICER: Then you were married ?
THE PATIENT: I think so . Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans . Might I have a glass of water ?
STUART: My leave is canceled . I ca n't meet you later .
HANA: Excuse me -
THE PATIENT: Yes ?
HANA: Can I ask - my friend , can he come in ? Just for a few minutes ?
THE PATIENT: Your friend ?
HANA: He 's going back to the front this evening . I ca n't see him otherwise .
THE PATIENT: Just go off . I 'll be quite all right .
HANA: No , I ca n't go , but if it , if you were n't offended , it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed . This is as private as we 'll get .
THE PATIENT: Well then - yes . Of course .
HANA: Thank you . Thank you .
THE PATIENT: Please , do n't waste your time on pleasantries -
STUART: Thanks .
THE PATIENT: I 'm going to sing . If I sing I sha n't hear anything .
HANA: You 've got a mustache .
STUART: A bit of one .
HANA: I was looking forward to this evening .
STUART: I had a hotel room .
HANA: I thought that was for when we were very very old ?
STUART: I 'm feeling old .
CARAVAGGIO: Supper . Hana calls after him .
HANA: Where 've you been ?
CARAVAGGIO: Rabbit hunting .
HANA: I could help you . I could get you off that .
CARAVAGGIO: Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life ?
HANA: It 's a week . We did n't know where you were - or if you coming back , or -
CARAVAGGIO: You should be happy . What were you going to do for him when it ran out ? He pulls out more phials from his jacket .
HANA: What do you do ? What are you doing here ?
CARAVAGGIO: Some gave me a dress . You know what 's great ? What I 'm learning ? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground . Everywhere I go , we 're in the right . I like that .
THE PATIENT: Something smells so rich . My stomach is heaving -
HANA: He came back , he says he caught a abbit . I 'm cooking it .
THE PATIENT: That 's a different dress .
HANA: He keeps asking me questions about you . Do you know him ? Do you recognize him ?
THE PATIENT: Do I recognize him ? I recognize what he is . I like him . He 's Canadian . He can read Italian . He can catch rabbits .
KATHARINE: Hello . Not to interrupt but we 're celebrating .
ALMÁSY: This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich , he 's been telling me about Zerzura , he thinks he 's been there , ut his map , the route he 's describing , he could n't survive the journey now , but he 's a poet , so his map is poetry - and now we 're onto an Ostrich . I 'm telling her your map is poetry . The Arab shrugs .
KATHARINE: What do you mean , poetry ?
ALMÁSY: A mountain curved like a woman 's back , a plateau the shape of an ear .
KATHARINE: Sounds perfectly clear . Where does the Ostrich come in ?
ALMÁSY: The Ostrich is a detour . A poor man hunts an ostrich , it 's the method . Nothing to do with Zerzura . To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move . The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds , a wadi , and stands where the ostrich can see him , on the horizon , and does n't move , does n't eat -
KATHARINE: What is he saying ? Come on , what did he say ?
ALMÁSY: He said - be careful .
KATHARINE: Be careful ? You mean you - or me ? Who ?
ALMÁSY: Her or me ?
CLIFTON: Gentlemen , to Zerzura .
ALL: Zerzura .
MADOX: And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine , without whose fund-raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels . They toast the Cliftons .
CLIFTON: To arm-twisting .
MADOX: Did Katharine say ? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo .
CLIFTON: Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army .
KATHARINE: Darling , Peter says I could stay
MADOX: Why not ?
ALMÁSY: What kind of photographs ?
CLIFTON: Portraits . The Brigadier , the Brigadier 's wife , the Brigadier 's dogs , the Brigadie at the Pyramids , the Brigadier breathing .
KATHARINE: Why do you think ? About my staying ?
CLIFTON: Well look , if nobody minds , truly , then I suppose - I shall , of course , be bereft
KATHARINE: Oh .
CLIFTON: But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life . I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems ?
ALMÁSY: Safe journey .
CLIFTON: You too . Good luck !
ALMÁSY: Clifton - your wife - do you think it 's appropriate to leave her ?
CLIFTON: Appropriate ?
ALMÁSY: I think the desert is , it 's - for a woman - it 's very tough , I wonde if it 's not too much for her .
CLIFTON: Are you mad ? Katharine loves it here . She told me yesterday .
ALMÁSY: All the same , I , were I you I would e concerned -
CLIFTON: I 've known Katharine since she was three , my aunt is her aunt , we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife . I think I 'd know what is and what is n't too much for her . I think she 's know herself .
ALMÁSY: Very well .
CLIFTON: Why are you people so threatened y a woman ? !
KATHARINE: I 've been thinking about - how does somebody like you decide to come to the desert ? What is it ? You 're doing whatever you 're doing - in your castle , or wherever it is you live , and one day ,
ALMÁSY: I once traveled with a terrific guide , who was taking me to Faya . He did n't speak for nine hours . At the end of it he pointed at the horizon and said - Faya ! That was a good day !
KATHARINE: Actually , you sing .
ALMÁSY: Pardon ?
KATHARINE: You sing . All the time .
ALMÁSY: I do not .
KATHARINE: Ask Al Auf .
AL AUF: Allahu Akbar , Allahu Akbar
ALMÁSY: Madox ! Madox !
MADOX: My God , they 're swimming !
D'AGOSTINO: Have you seen this ? Astonishing . Perfectly preserved .
BERMANN: I love the desert , you see . That 's my , that 's my - I ca n't think of the word . How do you explain ? To someone who 's never been here ? Feelings which seem quite normal .
ALMÁSY: I do n't know , my friend . I do n't know .
MADOX: I 'll be back as quick as I can . Thirty-six hours at the outside .
ALMÁSY: Try to get a second radiator , we 'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill . And a better jack . We planned badly .
MADOX: Bermann !
KAMAL: May God make safety your companion .
KATHARINE: I shall stay behind , of course
MADOX: Certainly not .
KATHARINE: I insist . There clearly is n't room fo us all , I 'm the least able to dig , and I 'm not one of the walking wounded . Those are facts . Besides , if I remain it 's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he 's doing and rescue us .
ALMÁSY: What 's this ?
KATHARINE: I thought you might paste them into your book .
ALMÁSY: We took several photographs , there 's no need .
KATHARINE: I 'd like you to have them .
ALMÁSY: There 's really no need . This is just a scrapbook . I should feel obliged . Thank you .
KATHARINE: And that would be unconscionable , I suppose , to feel any obligation ? Yes . Of course it would .
ALMÁSY: You should come into the shelter .
KATHARINE: I 'm quite all right , thank you .
ALMÁSY: Look over there . Katharine turns , scans the horizon .
KATHARINE: What am I looking at ?
ALMÁSY: See what 's happening to them - the stars .
KATHARINE: They 're so untidy . I 'm just trying to rearrange them .
ALMÁSY: In an hour there will be no stars . The air is filling with sand .
KATHARINE: This is not very good , is it ?
ALMÁSY: No .
KATHARINE: Shall we be all right ?
ALMÁSY: Yes . Absolutely .
KATHARINE: Yes is a comfort . Absolutely is not .
ALMÁSY: # NAME ? Which Mariners called the sea of darkness . Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England , producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood .
KATHARINE: Fiction . We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood . Go on . More .
ALMÁSY: All true . Herodotus , your friend , tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress , their swords raised .
KATHARINE: Our tracks , where are they ?
ALMÁSY: Madox will have calculated how many miles , they 'll soon turn around .
KATHARINE: Oh my God , the others !
ALMÁSY: Could I ask you , please , to paste you paintings into my book ? I should like to have them . I should be honored .
KATHARINE: Of course . Is it , am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have ?
ALMÁSY: Water ? Yes , we have water , we have a little in our can , we have water in the radiator which can be drunk . Not at all cowardly , extremely practical . Come on , come on ! There 's also a plant - I 've never seen it but I 'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid .
KATHARINE: Find that plant . Cut out its heart .
ALMÁSY: Kamal is passing blood . He must have had some internal damage in the crash . He needs medicine . I think we must risk the other flare .
KATHARINE: Geoffrey 's not in Cairo . He 's not actually a buffoon . And the plane was n't a wedding present . It belongs to the British Government . They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa . So I think he 's in Ethiopia . In case you were counting on his sudden appearance .
ALMÁSY: And the marriage - is that a fiction ?
KATHARINE: No , the marriage is n't a fiction .
ALMÁSY: No , but I think I do .
KATHARINE: Am I K. in your book ? I think I must be .
ALMÁSY: No .
KATHARINE: Will you please come in ?
ALMÁSY: Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns , disgusted .
KATHARINE: Do n't .
ALMÁSY: I believe you still have my book .
KATHARINE: You still have sand in your hair .
ALMÁSY: Good .
KATHARINE: You sew very badly .
ALMÁSY: You do n't sew at all !
KATHARINE: A woman should never learn to sew , and if she can she should neve admit to it . Close your eyes .
ALMÁSY: That makes it harder still .
KATHARINE: Now .
ALMÁSY: When were you least happy ?
KATHARINE: Now .
ALMÁSY: Okay . And what do you love ? Say everything .
KATHARINE: What do I love ? I love rice pudding , and water , the fish in it , hedgehogs ! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths .
ALMÁSY: What else ?
KATHARINE: Marmite - addicted ! Baths - not with other people ! Islands . You handwriting . I could go on all day . My husband . Almásy nods .
ALMÁSY: What do you hate most ?
KATHARINE: A lie . What do you hate most ?
ALMÁSY: Ownership . Being owned . When you leave , you should forget me .
THE PATIENT: Could I ask you to move ? I 'm sorry - ut when you turn , the sheets , I ca n't eally bear the sheets moving over me . Sorry .
HANA: Yes , of course , I 'm so sorry . Stupid of me . Hana gets up , upset to have hurt him .
MARY: Okay , Type Os , the vampires wait . Everybody 's giving a pint .
JAN: Ugh ! If they were sucking it out I would n't mind . It 's the needle I ca n't stand .
HANA: You 're a nurse - how ca you be frightened of needles !
WOUNDED SOLDIER: Ca n't wait to have me dead ? You bitch !
HANA: Try t be calm . Ssssshhh . Come on . Be calm now . Ssshhhh . Be peaceful . It 's okay . It 's okay .
CANADIAN SOLDIER: Is there anybody here from Picton ?
OLIVER: Picton ? I do n't know .
CANADIAN SOLDIER: I 'd like to see somebody from home efore I go .
HANA: Why Picton ?
OLIVER: He 's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right , Soldier ? The boy nods .
JAN: Where 's your Stuart from ? Somewhere near there , is n't it ?
HANA: As him what company he 's with ? Oliver leans over , then turns to Hana .
OLIVER: Third Canadian Fusiliers .
HANA: Does he know a Captain McGann ? The boy hears this , whispers to Oliver .
CANADIAN SOLDIER: He bought it . Yesterday . Shot to bits . The shells are getting closer .
HANA: What did he say ?
OLIVER: Does n't know him .
HANA: He 's gone , has n't he ?
OLIVER: No . He 's - no .
HANA: Oh God . Oh God .
CARAVAGGIO: Hana ? Hana ? Are you alright ?
HANA: Do n't touch me if you 're going to try and fuck me .
CARAVAGGIO: I 'll have some of your water . It 's hot .
HANA: I 'm not in love with him . I 'm in love with ghosts . And so is he . He 's in love with ghosts .
CARAVAGGIO: Who are his ghosts ?
HANA: Ask him .
CARAVAGGIO: What if I told you he did this to me ?
HANA: What ? How could he have ? When ?
CARAVAGGIO: I 'm one of his ghosts and he would n't even know . It 's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk .
HANA: I do n't know what that means .
CARAVAGGIO: Ask him . Ask your saint who he is . Ask him who he 's killed .
HANA: Please do n't creep around this house .
THE PATIENT: K is for Katharine .
ALMÁSY: Say you 're sick .
KATHARINE: What ? No !
ALMÁSY: Say you 're feeling faint - the sun .
KATHARINE: No .
ALMÁSY: I ca n't work . I ca n't sleep . Lady Hampton calls impatiently .
LADY HAMPTON: Katharine !
KATHARINE: Coming . I ca n't sleep . I woke up shouting in the middle of the night . Geoffrey thinks it 's the thing in the desert , the trauma .
ALMÁSY: I can still taste you .
KATHARINE: This is empty , just coming !
ALMÁSY: I 'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth . Swoon . I 'll catch you .
KATHARINE: I 'm fine . How silly .
OFFICER'S WIFE: It 's the heat .
LADY HAMPTON: You should sit down , darling . She 's quite all right . Are you pregnant ?
KATHARINE: I do n't think so .
LADY HAMPTON: How romantic . With Fiona I fell over every five minutes . Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall .
KATHARINE: I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes .
LADY HAMPTON: I 'll come with you .
KATHARINE: No , please . I shall be absolutely fine .
CLIFTON: Have you seen Katharine ?
ALMÁSY: What ?
CLIFTON: It 's Geoffrey under this .
ALMÁSY: I have n't , no . Sorry .
CLIFTON: Darling , I just heard . You poo sausage , are you all right ?
KATHARINE: I 'm fine . I got hot .
CLIFTON: Lady H said she thought you might be -
KATHARINE: I 'm not pregnant . I 'm hot . I 'm too hot .
CLIFTON: Right .
KATHARINE: Are n't you ?
CLIFTON: Sweltering . Come on , I 'll take you home .
KATHARINE: Ca n't we really go home ? I ca n't breathe . Are n't you dying for green , anything green , or rain , would n't you die to feel ain on your face ? It 's Christmas and it 's all - I do n't know - if you asked me I 'd go home tomorrow . If you wanted .
CLIFTON: Sweetheart , you know we ca n't go home , there might be a war .
KATHARINE: Geoffrey , you do so love putting on a disguise .
CLIFTON: I do so love you . What do you smell of ?
KATHARINE: What ?
CLIFTON: Marzipan ! I think you 've got marzipan in your hair . No wonder you 're homesick .
THE PATIENT: Are you outside ?
CARAVAGGIO: I ca n't hide anymore . I breathe like a dog . I lose my alance . Stealing 's got harder . Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus .
THE PATIENT: I do n't even know if it is my book . The Bedouin found it in the plane , in the wreckage . It 's mine now . I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain . I 'm dying for rain - of course I 'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face .
CARAVAGGIO: Is it you ? If I said Moose I look different , fuck , why should n't you ?
THE PATIENT: Moose .
CARAVAGGIO: First wedding anniversary - what do you call it ?
THE PATIENT: I do n't know . Paper . Is it ? Paper ? I do n't remember .
HANA: Excuse me . Yes ? I do n't have the key to that door .
KIP: The Germans were here . The Germans were all over this area . They left mines everywhere . Pianos were their favorite hiding places .
HANA: I see . Then may be you 're safe as long as you only play Bach . He 's German .
KIP: Is something funny ?
HANA: No , but , no , not at all . I 'm sorry . You came to the doors , that 's all and -
#NAME?: worried about mines . That 's all .
KIP: I 've met you before .
HANA: I do n't think so .
THE PATIENT: Sikh . If he wears a turban , he 's a Sikh .
HANA: I 'll probably marry him .
THE PATIENT: Really ? That 's sudden .
HANA: My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano . She goes over to the Patient 's bed .
THE PATIENT: Why ? Is he staying ?
HANA: With his Sergeant . A Mr. Hardy .
THE PATIENT: We should charge ! Does n't anyone have a job to do ?
HANA: They have to clear all the local roads of mines . That 's a big job . They wo n't stay in the house . They 're putting up their tent in the garden .
THE PATIENT: In that case , I suppose we ca n't charge .
CLIFTON: Darling , it 's me , I 'm sorry , something 's come up . Do n't sulk - I 'll be back tomorrow evening . I promise . Okay my precious , I love you .
RUPERT: I did n't know you were going anywhere ?
CLIFTON: I 'm not . I 'm going to surprise her . It 's our anniversary . She 's forgotten , of course . What 's the symbol for you first anniversary ? I should get something . Is it paper ? Moose ! Moose , you there ? First Anniversary - is it cotton ?
CARAVAGGIO: Is what cotton ?
CLIFTON: First Wedding Anniversary .
RUPERT: He 's hopeless !
CLIFTON: Your day will come , my sausage .
CARAVAGGIO: Your first anniversary is Paper .
CLIFTON: Stop !
CABBIE: Please ?
CLIFTON: Stop here .
CABBIE: Yessir .
KATHARINE: This is - what is this ?
ALMÁSY: It 's a folk song .
KATHARINE: Arabic ?
ALMÁSY: No , no , it 's Hungarian . My daijka sang it to me .
KATHARINE: It 's beautiful . What 's it about ?
ALMÁSY: It 's a long song - Szerelem means loveand the story - there 's a Hungarian Count , he 's a wanderer , a fool . For years he 's on some kind of quest , who knows what ? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave . He sews her clothes , he worships the hem of -
KATHARINE: You bastard , I was believing you !
ALMÁSY: I claim this shoulder blade - oh no , wait - I want this !
KATHARINE: I thought we were against ownership ? I can stay tonight .
ALMÁSY: Madox knows , I think . He 's tried to warn me . He keeps talking about Anna Karenina . I think it 's his idea of a man-to-man chat . Its my idea of a man-to-man chat .
KATHARINE: This is a different world - is what I tell myself . A different life . And here I am a different wife .
ALMÁSY: Yes . A different wife .
CLIFTON: Sorry .
CABBIE: Hotel now , sir ?
GEOFFREY: No .
ALMÁSY: I do n't care to bargain . It 's full of saffron , just in case you think I 'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing .
KATHARINE: That day , had you followed me to the market ?
ALMÁSY: Of course . You did n't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you 'd slapped my face .
KATHARINE: Shall we be all right ?
ALMÁSY: Yes . Yes . Absolutely .
CARAVAGGIO: Thought you 'd never wake up !
THE PATIENT: What ?
HANA: Where did you find that ?
CARAVAGGIO: I liberated it .
HANA: I think that 's called looting .
CARAVAGGIO: No-one should own music . The real question is who wrote the song ?
THE PATIENT: Irving Berlin .
CARAVAGGIO: For ?
THE PATIENT: Top Hat .
CARAVAGGIO: Is there a song you do n't know ?
HANA: No . He sings all the time .
THE PATIENT: I 've been told that before .
HANA: Kip 's another one .
HARDY: Hello miss .
HANA: I was going to say - if you want to eat with us , ever you and Lieutenant Singh
HARDY: Very kind of you , we can always eat in the town with the others -
HANA: Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear , so please .
HARDY: I 'll ask the Lieutenant . But thank you .
HANA: You saved my life . I have n't forgotten . I thought you were very very tall . You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who ca n't keep her balance .
HARDY: A toddle
HANA: Sorry , is it all right I 'm seeing this ? Kip shrugs .
KIP: Thank you .
HANA: Yes , for your hair .
KIP: Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
THE PATIENT: # NAME ? natives called the Lahore Museum .
KIP: It 's still there , the cannon , outside the museum . It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax , then melted down . Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives .
THE PATIENT: So what do you really object to - the writer or what he 's writing about ?
KIP: What I really object to , Uncle , is your finishing all my condensed milk . And the message everywhere in you ook - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled y the British .
THE PATIENT: Hana , we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I .
HANA: Arguing about books .
THE PATIENT: Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions .
KIP: I 'll get another tin . Hana and the Patient are alone .
HANA: I did n't like that book either . It 's all about men . Too many men . Just like this house .
THE PATIENT: You like him , do n't you ? You voice changes .
HANA: I do n't think it does . Anyway , he 's indifferent to me .
THE PATIENT: I do n't think it 's indifference . Kip comes bounding in with a fresh can .
HANA: Hey ! -
THE PATIENT: # NAME ?
KIP: Well , I 'm indifferent to cooking , not Hana 's cooking in particular . Have either of you ever tried condensed milk sandwiches ?
THE PATIENT: Careful - careful !
KIP: What 's he saying ?
HANA: He 's saying it 's wonderful !
MADOX: And I 'm telling you there 's nothing there to explore .
ALMÁSY: No , because you ca n't see from the air ! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple ! Look ! What is that ? Is that a wadi ? That whole spur is a real possibility
MADOX: Which we 've overflown twice .
ALMÁSY: Which we could n't explore because of rocks , because of cross-winds , it 's sloppy . And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura .
MADOX: So - on Thursday you do n't trust Bell 's map - Bell was a fool , Bell could n't draw a map , but on Friday he 's suddenly infallible ? Almásy is surprised by Madox ' anger .
ALMÁSY: In my room .
MADOX: Those maps belong to His Majesty 's Government . They 're confidential . They should n't be left lying around for any Tom , Dick or Mary to have sight of .
ALMÁSY: What 's the matter with you ?
MADOX: Do n't be so bloody naïve . You know there 's a war breaking out . This arrived this morning . By orde of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939 .
ALMÁSY: Why do they care about our maps ?
MADOX: What do we find in the desert ? Arrow heads , spears . In a war , if you own the desert , you own North Africa .
ALMÁSY: Own the desert .
MADOX: For God 's sake , man - pull yourself together .
SOLDIER: Beggin your pardon , miss , but have you got a lighter ?
KATHARINE: Fuck off .
SOLDIER: What ?
KATHARINE: You heard me .
ALMÁSY: Sorry .
KATHARINE: I ca n't do this , I ca n't do this any more .
ALMÁSY: I 'm not agreeing . Do n't think I 'm agreeing , because I 'm not .
KATHARINE: I just know - any minute he 'll find out , we 'll barge into somebody we 'll - and it will ill him .
ALMÁSY: Do n't go over it again , please .
KATHARINE: You will . You will .
THE PATIENT: I 'm still here .
HANA: You 'd better be .
THE PATIENT: Do n't depend on it . Will you ? That little bit of air , each day there 's less of it , which is al right , which is quite all right . She squeezes his hand , suddenly overwhelmed .
KIP: Go to the left ! Keep to the left ! There are mines and trip wires everywhere !
HANA: It 's okay - I 'll help . Please .
KIP: The mines , the wires , there 's a trick . Some explode if you stretch the wires , some if you cut them .
HANA: What do I do ?
KIP: There 's a mine here , but the others are far enough away , I think at least to give me a chance . I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over .
HANA: So I follow the wires ?
KIP: You get Hardy .
HANA: I follow the wires .
KIP: Do n't touch them .
HANA: Why would anyone do this ?
KIP: I 've done this . I 've had to do this . Then Hana 's suddenly tense .
HANA: Give me a second .
KIP: What are you doing ? ! Hana !
HANA: I promise you that was the right thing to do . He 's my good luck . Now cut . This one . I hope we do n't die .
KIP: Okay . Get away from here . Quick .
HANA: I 'm not scared . So many people have died around me . But I would be a shame for us . I do n't feel like being shy .
KIP: You must get away . Before I cut . I 'm not cutting if you 're here .
HANA: Actually , you ca n't cut , can you ? You 'll fall over . Give me the pliers .
KIP: No . But he hands them over .
HANA: Kiss me . Before I cut . Just in case .
KIP: Do n't talk . Check again . Lie flat and then cut .
THE PATIENT: Hana ! Hana ! Kip ! Hana ! He tries to move . He ca n't . He 's frantic .
HANA: I 'm sorry . I forgot you 'd be worrying . We 're all safe . It was a mine , but not the mine . Nobody 's hurt . I 'm sorry .
SOLDIER: And you 're definitely traveling with him of your own free will ?
HANA: Yes .
SOLDIER: Just wanting to be sure . And he 's taking you to church ?
HANA: Yes . We 're going to a funeral . A cow has died . And in his religion they 're sacred .
THE PATIENT: There was a general who wore a patch over a perfectly good eye . The men fought harder for him . Sometimes I think I could get up and dance . What 's under your bandages ?
CARAVAGGIO: Hold the ends .
AICHA: He 's waiting for you .
CARAVAGGIO: We have 30 , 000 troops in Tobruk . What are they going to be doing ?
MÜLLER: Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes .
CARAVAGGIO: No .
MÜLLER: Petty thief , six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary , 1937 .
CARAVAGGIO: I keep explaining . You 've got the wrong man . My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini . Bellini , Caravaggio , both painters , I think that is confusing you .
MÜLLER: Is this you ?
CARAVAGGIO: I do n't know .
MÜLLER: It is you . This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41 . And so was this - August 41 . And this -February 42 .
CARAVAGGIO: It 's impossible . I was buying or selling something . I 've been to Cairo many times .
MÜLLER: You are a Canadian spy working fo the Allies . Code-name Moose .
CARAVAGGIO: Could I have a doctor ? I am passing lood . I must be bleeding internally . Can you get a doctor ? Look - I 'm leaking blood . He kicks me . He kicks me all the time .
CLERK: He 's asking for a doctor .
MÜLLER: You want a doctor ?
CARAVAGGIO: Yes , I 've been asking for weeks , a month , I do n't know , also my leg was -
MÜLLER: We do n't have a doctor , but we do have a nurse .
CARAVAGGIO: A nurse ? Well , sure , a nurse is great . A nurse ? Great .
MÜLLER: Leave it and get the nurse !
CARAVAGGIO: I slept with the girl . I 've got a wife in Tripoli . A girl comes up and points at you , you only see trouble .
MÜLLER: I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do . This is your nurse , by the way . She 's Moslem , so she 'll understand all of this . What 's the punishment for adultery ? Let 's leave it at that . You 're married and you were fucking another woman , so that 's - is it the hands that are cut off ? Or is that for stealing ? Does anyone know ? There 's silence . Müller turns to Caravaggio .
CARAVAGGIO: Do n't cut me .
MÜLLER: Or was it Toronto ?
CARAVAGGIO: Do n't cut me . Come on .
MÜLLER: Ten fingers . How about this ? You give me a name for every finger - does n't matter who . I get something , you keep something . I 'm trying to be easonable . Fenelon-Barnes , we could call that two names . Are thumbs fingers ? Is a thumb a finger ?
CLERK: The telephone -
MÜLLER: What are you doing ?
STENOGRAPHER: That Geneva Convention . I 'm -
CARAVAGGIO: You ca n't do that ! Hey - come on !
MÜLLER: Go ! Hey ! Go ! Caravaggio is in terror .
CARAVAGGIO: Oh Jesus . Oh Jesus Christ .
MÜLLER: Cut the other thumb . He stabs at his own right thumb .
CARAVAGGIO: The man who took my thumbs , I found him eventually - he 's dead . The man who took my photograph , I found him too - that took me a year . He 's dead . Anothe man took that man across the desert to Cairo . Now I intend to find him .
ALMÁSY: I believe I 'm rather late .
MADOX: Good , we 're all here ? A toast , to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface .
THE OTHERS: The International Sand Club !
ALMÁSY: Misfits , buggers , fascists , and paedophiles . God bless us every one . The others drink , trying to ignore his mood .
CLIFTON: Sorry , what 's your point ?
ALMÁSY: And the people here do n't want us . Are you kidding ? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials - is n't that right ? Their best people get down on hands and knees egging to be spared a knighthood . Is n't that right ?
D'AGOSTINO: Let 's eat first . Sit down .
ALMÁSY: We 'll bathe at Brighton , the fish we 'll frighten when we 're in . you athing suit so thin will make the shellfish grin , fin to fin . Those were the words - actually - before they were cleaned up . Could be a song for you , Mrs. Clifton -
MADOX: Look , either shut up , or go home .
ALMÁSY: Absolutely right , shut up . Lashings of apologies all round .
KATHARINE: What ?
ALMÁSY: What ? What ? That boy , that little boy , you were holding his collar , gripping his collar , what for ?
KATHARINE: Would you let me pass ?
ALMÁSY: Is he next ? Do you drag him into you little room ? Where is it ? Is this it ?
KATHARINE: Do n't do this .
ALMÁSY: I 've watched you - on verandahs , at Garden Parties , at the Races - how can you stand there ? How can you ever smile ? As if your life had n't capsized ?
KATHARINE: You know why ? He tries to hold her . She resists
ALMÁSY: Dance with me .
KATHARINE: No .
ALMÁSY: Dance with me . I want to touch you . I want the things which are mine . Which belong to me .
KATHARINE: Do you think you 're the only one who feels anything ? Is that what you think ?
THE PATIENT: Why do n't you go ? You should sleep .
HANA: Would you like me to ?
HARDY: I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh .
HANA: He 's sleeping .
HARDY: Only we have to go to work .
HANA: I 'll tell him . What is it ? Is it a mine ?
HARDY: A bomb . At the Viaduct . She closes the door , then reappears .
HANA: Does he have to go ?
HARDY: Pardon me ?
HANA: What if you could n't find him ? Sergeant , not today , please . Not this morning . Kip comes to the door , winding his turban .
KIP: What 's happening ? Am I needed ?
HARDY: I 'm afraid so , sir . Kip hurries to his tent . Hana follows him .
HANA: Do n't go . I 'm frightened . I can love a coward , I ca n't love another dead man .
KIP: This is what I do . I do this every day .
HARDY: Corporal ! ? Dade ! !
DADE: Tanks , sir . Do n't know what it 's about . God only knows .
HARDY: What is this - a bloody carnival ? Stop them !
KIP: Go away .
HARDY: Yessir .
KIP: This is making me incredibly angry .
HARDY: Get a blanket ! Dade ! Get the Lieutenant a blanket .
KIP: Congratulations .
HANA: Kip !
KIP: Yes . Later .
CARAVAGGIO: Have a drink .
THE PATIENT: I 've had a drink . Fatal .
CARAVAGGIO: Well , anything you do is likely to be fatal , so you know -
THE PATIENT: Very true !
HANA: Never heard of it .
THE PATIENT: That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club .
CARAVAGGIO: What ? You and Madox ? Or you and Katharine Clifton ?
THE PATIENT: What ?
HANA: What was that ?
SPALDING: Booby trap . They was running up the Union Jack , sir , up off that statue - It just went off .
DADE: Should have been me . It was my idea ut Sergeant Hardy climbed up , sir , him and Blackler .
SPALDING: Sir - you do n't want to look .
KIP: Who 's that girl ?
DADE: His fiancee , sir .
KIP: Hardy 's ?
DADE: Kept it a bit dark .
KIP: I was thinking yesterday - yesterday ! - the Patient , Hardy they 're everything that 's good about England . I could n't even say what that was . We did n't exchange two personal words , and we 've been together through some terrible things , some - he was engaged to a girl in the village ! - I mean - and us - he never once He did n't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I do n't even know what I 'm talking about .
HANA: You loved him .
KIP: I try not to expect you .
HANA: But if it got late and I had n't shown up ?
KIP: Then I 'd think there must be a reason .
HANA: You would n't come to find me ? That makes me never want to come here . But she continues unraveling the turban .
MADOX: Had a letter from my wife . The wisteria is still out , which I 'm looking forward to . She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever . Wrong coast I should have thought , still
ALMÁSY: Right .
MADOX: Bermann thinks he 'll be interned , poor fellow . I 'm going to do what I can , but And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini . So now you can say I told you so .
ALMÁSY: I told you so .
MADOX: We did n't care about countries . Did we ? Brits , Arabs , Hungarians , Germans . None of that mattered , did it ? It was something finer than that .
ALMÁSY: Yes . It was . Thanks for the compass . I 'll look after it for you .
MADOX: When 's Clifton picking you up ?
ALMÁSY: Tomorrow afternoon . Do n't worry . I 'll be ready .
MADOX: I 'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis . So if you need ithard to know how long one 's talking about . We might all be back in a month or two .
ALMÁSY: Goodbye , my friend . They shake hands .
MADOX: May God make safety your companion .
ALMÁSY: There is no God . But I hope someone looks after you .
MADOX: In case you 're still wondering - this is called the supasternal notch . Almásy nods , goes to the propeller .
HANA: Sometimes I need you to find me .
THE PATIENT: Hana tells me you 're leaving .
CARAVAGGIO: There are going to be trials , they want me to interpret , do n't they know I 'm allergic to courtrooms ?
THE PATIENT: We shall miss you .
CARAVAGGIO: So , I come across the Hospital Convoy I was looking for this stuff , and some nurse , Mary , Hana 's friend , tells me about you and Hana , hiding in a monastery , in purdah , whatever it is - etreat - how you 'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you did n't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -
#NAME?: full of letters and cuttings , and then I knew it must be you .
THE PATIENT: Me ?
CARAVAGGIO: I 'd seen you writing in that book . At the Embassy in Cairo , when I had thumbs and you had a face . And a name .
THE PATIENT: I see .
CARAVAGGIO: Before you went over to the Germans , efore you got Rommel 's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters . He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk , so they made an impression .
THE PATIENT: And you thought you 'd come and settle the score ?
CARAVAGGIO: You were the only man who knew the desert well enough , the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing .
THE PATIENT: I had to get back to the desert . I made a promise . The rest meant nothing to me .
CARAVAGGIO: What did you say ?
THE PATIENT: The rest meant nothing to me .
CARAVAGGIO: There was a result to what you did . It was n't just another expedition . It did this . If the British had n't unearthed your nosey photographe in Cairo thousands of people could have died .
THE PATIENT: Thousands of people did die , just different people .
CARAVAGGIO: But you were among the British , they were your friends - why betray them ?
THE PATIENT: Is that what you thought ? That I etrayed the British ? The British etrayed me . The British betrayed me .
ALMÁSY: Katharine ! Oh dear God , Katharine - what are you doing here ?
KATHARINE: I ca n't move . I ca n't get out .
ALMÁSY: Why did he bring you ?
KATHARINE: A surprise , he said .
ALMÁSY: We 've got to get you out of here .
KATHARINE: It hurts too much .
ALMÁSY: I know , darling , I 'm sorry .
KATHARINE: Why did you hate me ?
ALMÁSY: What ?
KATHARINE: Do n't you know you drove everybody mad ?
ALMÁSY: Do n't talk .
KATHARINE: You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk .
ALMÁSY: You 're wearing the thimble .
KATHARINE: Of course . You idiot . I always wear it . I 've always worn it . I 've always loved you .
ALMÁSY: I know . I 'm sorry . I 'll make a fire . I 'll be back .
KATHARINE: Do n't leave me !
ALMÁSY: I 'm just going to find things for the fire .
KATHARINE: Shall we be all right ?
ALMÁSY: Yes . Absolutely .
KATHARINE: Oh dear .
ALMÁSY: Listen to me , Katharine . You 've broken your ankle and I 'm going to have to try and bind it . I think your wrist might be oken , too - and some ribs , which is why it 's hurting you to breathe . I 'm going to have to walk to El Taj . Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or anothe efore I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel . And then I 'll be back and we 'll be fine , and I 'll never leave you .
KATHARINE: Do you promise ? I would n't want to die here . I would n't want to die in the desert . I 've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind , with particular hymns . Very English . And I know exactly where I want to be buried . In our garden . Where I grew up . With a view of the sea . So promise me you 'll come back for you .
ALMÁSY: I promise I 'll come back . I promise I 'll never leave you . And there 's plenty of water and food . You can have a party .
KATHARINE: Thank you . Will you bury Geoffrey ? I know he 's dead .
ALMÁSY: I 'm sorry , Katharine .
KATHARINE: I know .
ALMÁSY: Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again .
KATHARINE: Our Garden , our garden - not so much the garden , but the copse alongside it , wild , a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but wate etween you and France . The Devil 's Chimney it was called - The Devil 's Chimney , I do n't know why . Darling . My darling .
OFFICER: Good morning !
ALMÁSY: Could I trouble you for some water ?
OFFICER: Yes , of course . So , golly , where have you come from ?
ALMÁSY: I desperately need a jeep . There 's een an accident .
OFFICER: I see .
ALMÁSY: No , I 'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too , to come with me , can I take this vehicle ? I 'll pay , of course - and some morphine and Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk .
OFFICER: Do you have your papers , sir ?
ALMÁSY: What ?

ALMÁSY: Am I not talking sense ? - forgive me , I 'm , I 've been walking , I 've - there 's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir , in the Cave of Swimmers . I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society .
OFFICER: Right . And what 's your name , sir ?

ALMÁSY: Look , listen to me . A woman is dying - my wife ! - is dying seventy miles from here . I have been walking for three days ! I do n't want to spell my name , I want you to give me this jeep !
OFFICER: I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
ALMÁSY: No ! NO ! Do n't radio anybody , just give me the fucking jeep !
CORPORAL: Shut-up !
ALMÁSY: Please - I beg you , I beg you , I beg you , please listen to me , this is a terrible mistake . Just stop , please , and listen to me . My wife is dying .
CORPORAL: Listen , Fritz , if I have to listen to another word from you I 'll give you a fucking good hiding .
ALMÁSY: Fritz ? What are you talking about ? Who 's Fritz ?
CORPORAL: That 's your name innit ? Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck ? What 's that supposed to be then , Irish ?
ALMÁSY: Let me out , let me out , let me out - Katharine ! Katharine !
SOLDIER: You 'll have to wait . Sarge ! Jerry wants to use the lav - says it 's urgent .
ALMÁSY: Where are we going , please ?
SOLDIER: To the coast . Benghazi . Soon be there . Get a boat home . You 'll be all right .
SERGEANT: What 's up ?
ALMÁSY: Cramps . It 's urgent .
SERGEANT: Go on then - you take him .
THE PATIENT: So yes . She died because of me . Because I loved her . Because I had the wrong name .
HANA: What are you up to ?
KIP: That gun at Lahor , Kipling 's cannon - Zamzammah - remember ? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things . I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns .
HANA: I should go to the house , get breakfast .
KIP: The lamp was burning all night in his oom . Caravaggio was there with him .
HANA: Nya-nya-nya !

This is all the money I have - well , all but twenty - it 's almost 500 , and I 'll give you all of it if you 'll just listen to what just two minutes , okay ? Please ?
JIM TOLLER: Pardon my French , dear , but I hope you got pleasure from it , 'cause you have really fucked yourself . You had two chances to file a complaint with the police and put his violence on ecord . You ignored them . Which tells him to keep comin ' till he kills you . Slim reacts to this .
SLIM: Hehe already did .
JIM TOLLER: If you do n't show up , the judge 'll rule against you , you become a fugitive from the law . If you do show , Mitch will , as you say , portray you as a drug addict . For all I know you are one you break in here , uninvited . I 'd say your husband has a good chance fo sole custody . Now if you do n't mind I 'd like to go back to my work .
SLIM: .That 's all ? You 're not gon na help me ?
JIM TOLLER: No one can help you , lady .

GRACIE: Call me Queen Elizabeth .
CRUZ: Baker . You got it solved ?
GIN: I was with someone , all right ?
CRUZ: So ? This is work .
GIN: Hector , I hardly know the guy . Why be impolite to strangers ?
CRUZ: Look at those assholes He means the cops on live feed .
GIN: Yeh , well , they did n't insure it , so they do n't have to solve this . To them it 's a crime . To us it 's 24 mil , less re-insurance , which is CRUZ Only thirty percent , Gin . Ouch . Really ?
CRUZ: Which is why you 're on this .
GIN: He came in through the window .
CRUZ: That 's not possib
GIN: What 's not possible is entry through the doors or the vents . That would have triggered instant alarm .
CRUZ: The windows are wired , too .
GIN: Only for trauma . They used smart glass , where the sensors respond to violation of the panel 's integrity . He 's listening . He always does with her .
CRUZ: The pane weighs 200 pounds , the uilding 's 1100 feet high .
GIN: This particular guy is the best . The best there ever was .
CRUZ: Popping the frame would trigge the alarm .
GIN: Here 's how I figured it out
CRUZ: You said . This particular guy .
GIN: Andrew MacDougal . Delighted at his stupefied reaction .
CRUZ: Why not Houdini ? Or Pretty Boy Floyd ? Maybe Jesus Christ .
GIN: Because they could n't do it . His slow smile . This fucking kid .
CRUZ: He 's been out of the business . For ten years .
GIN: Maybe not . No one ever proved , hell , even arrested him , fo stealing anything . But we all u > know he was numero ichiban fo thirty years . Why not forty ? She 's serious .
CRUZ: Why ? Because of the Bozo switch ? Guys have been copying his pack- at signature for decades . Maybe the thief wanted it to look like MacDougal .
GIN: A list of his private collection . Complete to three acquisitions last Thursday .
CRUZ: No Vermeer . Nothing close .
GIN: Do n't be a putz . This is his u > legitimate collection , which he u > buys . Presentable for any search warrant surprise party .
CRUZ: Oh , I get it . He has no interest in Vermeers , so that proves he stole one . By that logic , he oughta be a suspect most of the time . She shakes her head , sadly .
GIN: You love to embarrass yourself .
CRUZ: So he was there .
GIN: Staking it out . Why bid , when you can mark the buyer , and jack it within the month ?
CRUZ: But you know better .
GIN: Bet your ass . At Vegas odds .
CRUZ: And you did all this since 4 30 this morning .
GIN: Uh . I 'm showing off .
MAC: Something of a habit ? She is minus a comeback .
GIN: No , you ca n't . He blinks . No ? GIN It 's sold .
MAC: Are you a confederate of my adversaries ? Or are you just stupid . And walks . Away . HOLD on her . Feeling like both .
GIN: Gin , actually , Gin Romay . I was named after a card game .
MAC: Or a cheap cocktail . She blinks . His brows raise MAC As in . I 'll have a Gin Romay , please . With a twist .
GIN: You 're supposed to be charming .
MAC: I 'm supposed to be selective . Glances back to her card . Reads
GIN: In mint condition . She sighs . Achingly lovely .
MAC: You said . Everything . Huh ? Oh .
GIN: The cat burglar stories ? Why would anyonewith so much to losetake those kinds of risks ? Guileless smile .
MAC: Excuse me .
GIN: I did n't know Porsche made things like this .
MAC: Well , they do n't Tipping the valet . Sliding in
GIN: Recognize that ? No reaction .
MAC: No , you ca n't .

MAC: Staying here , as well . You are in room ? GIN One thirty-eight . In one motion , he flags the bartender

GIN: You 're going to need stitches , let me get you to a hospital .
MAC: That 's actually . Very sweet .
GIN: Mr. MacDougal ? Sir ? No sound . Uh-oh .
MAC: I 'm an old man . You probably noticed .
GIN: Microchips , I think , for computers . He opens the door . Ushers her through
MAC: Bad investment . The best ones are here today Follows her out
GIN: This is n't the way to my sel MAC I 've changed my mind .
MAC: You ca n't get it for me at 2.5 , can you ?
GIN: Well , we can tr
MAC: You were setting me up . The correct price is 2.8 . You conspire with the seller to start at 4.6 , so I 'll be grateful when you 'bargain ' him down to three . Close enough to fool some people . unfortunately He sighs . Never looks at her .
GIN: So where are we g
MAC: I am going to the airport . You are going on to the rest of you life . Which He thinks . Admits
GIN: You forgot your lugg
MAC: The hotels deal with that . The things I need are always waiting at the next one . I do n't carry . Baggage . Little twist on that .
GIN: Sensible . And you 're off to ?
MAC: Oh , that 's highly personal .
GIN: I did so hope to impress you .
MAC: Young lady . I am old enough to e your grandfather . She shakes her head . Uh-uh . GIN My father . Leans her mouth in for the kill . GIN That 's part of the rush .
GIN: Here . A reward .
MAC: A reward for what ?
GIN: For not being old . After all .
MAC: You mean . Not as old as I look . She traces her finger along his cheek . GIN Yeh .
GIN: Do I deserve a reward ?
MAC: What 's hard to find . Is someone you truly want to be with . And leans closer . Just above a whisper
GIN: It 's lucky we stopped by my room , for the wine .
MAC: Would that make it more stolen ?
GIN: They even got my prescriptions .
MAC: Something you need ? There are all-night chemists
GIN: I take Prilosec . For stomach acid . And an inhaler . For asthma .
MAC: Ah . Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable in there . Something in the tone .
GIN: Such as
MAC: Well . Wannabe dealers make excellent fences .
GIN: He thought I had a stolen painting . In my bag .
MAC: I 'm joking , of course . Kisses the top of her head .

GIN: You said . Vermeer .
MAC: The most famous painting stolen this week . His turn . To kiss her nose .
GIN: I love a guy who knows how to sweet talk .
MAC: There was a call . While you were sleeping . A call .
GIN: Me .
MAC: If I 'm there , he 'll haggle . You just hand him the debit card , with thatluminous smile . And say , take it or leave it .
GIN: Thought I already did th
MAC: And along with making an excellent < /u impression . You will also make 2 percent of the purchase price . She blinks .
GIN: Stolen painting is it ?
MAC: Of course not . And on his way out the door
OKATI: You doin ' it .
GIN: I think there 's some mista
OKATI: You from Mac ? She stops . Jesus . The guy COUGHS horribly .

GIN: Nice . When a sky is that .
MAC: Is it easier now ? Not pretending . Is it ?
GIN: Because the museum displays 10,000 elics at any given moment . But there are 60 times that many , stored in the mountain . This overwhelms . Even Mac .
MAC: Seems like overkill . For one simple jump .
GIN: Well , it 's an eight billion dollar jump . You miss the trainyou 've missed the train .
MAC: we 've missed the train , yeh . The Bones ? The Scan ?

MAC: remain in control .
GIN: Colonel
QIU: You look lovely , Ginger . Is the rose for me ?
GIN: Of course .
QIU: Like the place , Andy ?
MAC: Please . Mr. MacDougal will do .
QIU: This way . Does n't matter if we spill .
MAC: My sentiments exactly . He sits .
QIU: This place was a gift . From its former owner . A Brit whose usiness will now happily continue to function . Perhapseven expand . MAC Planning to spend much time here ?
GIN: The Colonel has divorced his wife . To facilitate the necessary entertaining of Western women .
QIU: Tho some are more entertaining than others .
MAC: Colonel . You are touching the woman I love Which brings Qiu 's eyes over . Really ?
QIU: You 're a Scot . Would you like some 25-year-old Macallan ?
MAC: Sure , I 'll take a case .
GIN: The Colonel told his Ministe of Culture that he could mount a surgical raid to liberate this treasure from Taiwan .
MAC: Ah . How much was the Ministe told the raid would cost ? QIU Counting equipment , personnel , ibes , an even fifty million American . All in .
QIU: He would have paid twice that . But my needs are modest .
GIN: How do I look , honey ? And Mac smiles . In return .
MAC: Like a woman . Of mystery .
GIN: In the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building . Is a room with two computers . One for you . And one for me .
MAC: Glad I have a function , here .
GIN: The room is a vault on the 14th floor . Access codes to that room are changed daily , computer pass- words on the hour , but
MAC: And his retinal plate is in there . Yep .
GIN: Hong Kong has a huge portion of its holdings invested in foreign banks . In hundreds of separate accounts Holds up the metallic disc .
MAC: Modest .
GIN: Two or three million at a crack , in odd numbers . Total , eight illion . And change .
MAC: And you 've set up a laundry .
GIN: Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches , Austria , Uruguay , Antigua , The Channel Islands , the Caymans MAC Seychelles ? GIN I left that out .
MAC: You 're forgiven .
GIN: Thank you . As soon as each deposit lands somewhere , it 's shot somewhere else , til the Mafia could n't find it .
MAC: But those first instructions , transferring the 8 billion dollars . They 're recorded in the main computer . She waggles the disc .
GIN: Nope . The CD instructs the compute to erase the real transactions . And replace them in its memory with an innocuous loan coded XJ6 . Little homage to Limeyland , there .
MAC: Dearest . The accounts wo n't econcile . She waggles the disc . Again .
GIN: Wrong . The CD instructs the compute to over-report all account totals forever , in the exact amounts we 've lifted . So the Chinese think the money 's still there . On this one . He has to smile .
MAC: The money . Is still . Missing .
GIN: Sure , the foreign banks know they sent out some money . But they think Hong Kong knows it , too . And since we 're leaving plenty in every account
MAC: The shit does n't splatter . Until the first account runs dry . Exactly .
GIN: And then . Comes the really u > brilliant part of the whole thing !
MAC: I was hoping there 'd be one . He settles back . Looks at her .
GIN: Admit it , so far you 're lown away . Well
MAC: It does sound like the beginning of a beautiful friendship . And his fingers reach out
GIN: Bet you say that . To all the one-night-stands .
MAC: No , ma'am He leans to her
GIN: Well , I promised him a bonus . Five million . Comes out of your share .
MAC: long as I do n't have to have sex with him .
GIN: What 's your point ? MAC That I like you , Ginger .
MAC: The dedication , the skill , the guts
GIN: Uploading . And you 've got two minutes , fifty seconds .
MAC: So let 's see . Across town at the British Consulate
GIN: China will think it happened u > before midnight . Britain will swear it happened after midnight
MAC: They 'll each be positive . The other guy . Did it . Mac sighs . This is a sad thing .
GIN: Britain off-line in 18 seconds . We 're bulletproof . His smile returns . Bittersweet and real
MAC: Baby girl . Nothing . Is ulletproof . Ever .
GIN: The CD wo n't come out of the driver . Houston . We have a problem .
MAC: Relax , do n't jam it GIN u > FUCKING THING ! !
GIN: We ca n't leave it IN THERE , it 's got all our accounts , everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS ! !
MAC: Easy with that , there 's no ru

GIN: They do n't know we 're the ad guys . He PLUNGES his hand into her shoulder bag
MAC: Time they find out .
GIN: Okay . How do we get down ?
MAC: Down ? I never liked down .
GIN: Okay , now what ? MAC Shut up . You 're on a 'need-to- know ' basis .
MAC: Well . Something to be said fo eing self-aware .
GIN: I ca n't do this .
MAC: You can . If I say so . She stares up at his eyes . He smiles .
GIN: HEY !
MAC: Got the keys ? Oh .
GIN: I thought you couldhot-wire stuff ? Guess not .
MAC: They fix those things so you ca n't steal them And keeps walking . Toward the monster CRANE .
GIN: You 're not gon na lower me ove the side .
MAC: Of course not . Now close baby eyes Suit yourself .
GIN: OH NOOOOOOOOOO .
MAC: Let go NOW ! ! He YANKS her loose , and they drop
GIN: God , I hate you .
MAC: You ran your calls . She did . She is frankly exhilarated .
GIN: All the transactions , all the transfers . It 's a miracle .
MAC: Why ? The CD erased the trans- actions , all accounts seem in order . It looks like the thieves were stopped in time . She sighs . It is a miracle .
GIN: The Colonel says police have nothing . A man in black-tie , a londe in a gown . The elevato guards saw faces , but no mug shots to ID . I think it 's over . Mac 's smile . Bittersweet affection .
MAC: Except it never is , really . Quite . Over .
GIN: Well , one hopes not . The Bristol , huh ? InParis ? Ah .
MAC: You 're not going back to Mr. Cruz , and the nine-to-five ?
GIN: Not hardly . I 've arranged to be killed in a car crash . On Taipei . Amazing how little it costs .
MAC: Well . You want to watch those pennies .
GIN: I could arrange for two . In that crash . His smile back .
MAC: You know , for a bitch . You can e awfully sweet .
GIN: Woman of mystery . What do you say ? I like the Bristol , just fine . mean , it 's not the Ritz
MAC: You know , all night I 've been wrestling with something
GIN: Not the most flattering way to put it .
MAC: I 've changed your travel plans .

GIN: Mac , wh
MAC: Shhh . You always talk too much .
GIN: And all themicrochips , the diamond machine
MAC: Well , the chips were returned . The machine was just a box , did you actually think it was real ? Glances at her .
GIN: I thoughteverything was real . Stupid girl .
MAC: Well , the State Department liked that one . They have more fish to fry with Beijing than Taiwan . He sighs .
GIN: And the 5 billion . Ah . That .
MAC: I have n't told them .
GIN: And my tickets . In the shopping bag ?
MAC: Well . Kept my options open . If I give you up , they do n't matter , do they ? Her heart pounding through her chest .
GIN: If .
MAC: Had lots of crazy thoughts . One was retirement . With four billion dollars . After all , I know some places where life could be private
GIN: But you could n't do that , huh ?
MAC: Creature of habit . I suppose . We feel her adrenaline racing .
GIN: Lots . Of thoughts , you s
MAC: Keep smiling . They wo n't move , until I raise my left arm .
GIN: Oughta shoot you in the face .
MAC: Come on , you can do it , if I sa

MAC: Ten seconds , hold on .
GIN: When do I see you ? There is no answer . There are no words .
MAC: Airport . Changing at Mongkok Station , we can cut her off .
AGENT: I think Yaumatei changes for the airport , and it 's closer .
ERIN BROCKOVICH: A True Story
ERIN: Fuck .
ED: Do n't ask that on Mondays , Rosalind .
BRENDA: Tony Marvin .
ED: Oh , Jesus . Who 's responsible for his pain and suffering this time ?
BRENDA: His dry cleaners . You want him ?
ED: What do you think ? What 's this ?
BRENDA: Tequila . From your drug dealer friend .
ED: Carlos is n't a friend ; he 's a client .
BRENDA: He 's a low-life . Speaking of which , that 's your nine o'clock in there .
ED: Whoa . Remind me .
BRENDA: Erin Brockovich . Car accident . Not he fault , she says . And she looks like such an honest girl , do n't you think ?

ED: Erin hi . Sorry you had to wait . Here , sit down , sit down . He clears a stack of papers off a chair .
ERIN: Thanks a lot . I tell you , I never thought just standing would take it out of me , but ever since that shithead hit me , it feels like my whole ody 's put together wrong . Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy .
ED: Jesus , you poor thing . Well , listen , you came to the right place . Whoever did this to you made one hell of a mistake , and you and me , we 're gon na make him pay for it .
ERIN: I was pulling out real slow , and out of nowhere , his Jaguar comes racing around the corner like a bat outta hell
ED: Yeah . I know .
DEFENDING LAWYER: Seventeen thousand in debt . Whew . Is you ex-husband helping out ?
ERIN: Which one ?
DEFENDING LAWYER: There 's more than one ?
ERIN: Yeah . There 's two . Why ?
DEFENDING LAWYER: Right . No doubt .
ERIN: What 's your point ?
DEFENDING LAWYER: Broke , three kids , no job . A doctor in a Jaguar must 've looked like a pretty good meal ticket .
ERIN: What ? Hey he hit me .
DEFENDING LAWYER: So you say .
ERIN: He came tearing around the corner , out of control
DEFENDING LAWYER: An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control
ERIN: That asshole smashed in my fucking neck !
ED: If you had n't used profanity
ERIN: Oh , please , it was long over by then . God damn , he made me look like some cheap
ED: I told you the questions might get a little personal
ERIN: Bullshit . You told me I 'd get half a million dollars . You told me I 'd be set .
ED: Okay let 's try and settle down here .
ED: I 'm sorry , Erin .
ERIN: Yeah ? Well , fuck you . Sorry does n't feed my kids .
MRS. MORALES: Hi , Erin ! You 're back so soon . How was it ?
ERIN: Hi , sweetie . Were you a good girl ? Where are Matt and Katie ?
MRS. MORALES: Outside with the sprinkler . So it 's good ? The truth is too depressing to share .
ERIN: It 'll be fine , yeah .
MRS. MORALES: Ai , bueno . Because I did n't want to tell you before , with your worries
ERIN: What ?
MRS. MORALES: My daughter , she 's bought a big house with a oom for me . I 'm going to move in with her .
ERIN: You 're moving away ? When ?
MRS. MORALES: Next week .
ERIN: Wow , that 's soon
MRS. MORALES: I know . But it 's good for me . Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids . And it 's good for you , too . Now you have money , you can find a good babysitter , huh ? Not the old lady next door .
ERIN: Ugh .
MATTHEW: I do n't like this part , it 's all crusty .
KATIE: I like the crust . Erin switches the plates .
ERIN: Put your napkins in your laps and eat up .
KATIE: How come you 're not eating ? Cause there is n't enough food .
ERIN: Mamma 's gon na eat later .
ED: Damn it ! Brenda ! She pops her head in .
BRENDA: Yeah ?
ED: What the hell is this doing here ?
BRENDA: It 's those files you asked for .
ED: I did n't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor . Jesus . Look at me . What do I have this afternoon ?
BRENDA: Nothing you ca n't show up for with a stain .
ED: What 's she doing here ?
BRENDA: Who ?
ED: Hey Mario what 's she doing here ?
MARIO: She works here . Ed looks back at her what the hell ?
ED: Erin ! How 's it going ?
ERIN: You never called me back . I left messages .
ED: You did ? Wow , sorry about that . Listen , Mario 's a little not so bright . He seems to think that you said
ERIN: There 's two things I ca n't stand , Mr. Masry . Being ignored , and being lied to . You did oth .
ED: I never lied . I may have miscalculated that happens sometimes , but
ERIN: You said things would be fine , and they 're not .
ED: I 'm sorry about that . Really . But
ERIN: I do n't need pity . I need a paycheck . And I 've looked , but when you 've spent the last six years raising babies , it 's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn . So I figure , since you 're the one who said I was gon na be okay , you should e the one to hire me . Ed sees everyone watching him , listening .
ED: I 'd love to help , Erin , but I 'm sorry , I have a full staff right now , so
ERIN: Bullshit . If you had a full staff , you 'd have time to return your damn phone calls .
ED: Okay , look . If you really want to apply fo a job here , you can do it the way everyone else does . Send in a rÈsumÈ , make an
ERIN: I 'm not everyone else , Mr. Masry . I 'm someone you made promises to that you did n't deliver on . I trusted you . With my kids ' well-being . Now , I 'm smart , and I 'm hard- working , and I 'll do anything . But if you think I 'm leaving here without a job , you got another thing coming .
ED: No benefits .
ANNA: what we do in here is keep track of all the case files . That way , at any time , we can find out a case 's status where it is in the office , stuff like that . We file 'em all here , alphabetically
ERIN: Oh , hell . I 'm dyslexic .
ANNA: That 's a joke , right ?
JANE: Just last week , he told my sister we were n't hiring .
BRENDA: What 's your sister look like ?
ERIN: Mr. Masry ? He turns , sees her .
ED: Yeah ?
ERIN: I was wondering could you tell me who I 'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck ? Just for the weekend .
ED: Jane 's the office manager . She handles payroll and petty cash . But she leaves early on Fridays .
ERIN: Oh . Okay . That 's okay .
ED: Oh , for Christ 's sake He takes out his wallet , looks in .
ERIN: I do n't wan na take your money , Mr. Masry .
ED: Bullshit , you do n't .
KATIE: Mommy , can I get a flower ?
ERIN: Sweetheart , you can get a whole big bunch .
GEORGE: Well , hello to you , darlin ' .
ERIN: What the hell do you think you 're doing , making all that Goddamn noise ?
GEORGE: Just introducing myself to the neighbors .
ERIN: Well , I 'm the neighbors . There , now we 're introduced , so you can shut the fuck up .
GEORGE: Ooh , now , see , if I'da known there was a eautiful woman next door , I'da done this different . Let 's start over . My name 's George . What 's yours ?
ERIN: Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet , and we 'll get along fine .
GEORGE: Now , do n't be like that . Tell you what . How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness ?
ERIN: You want my number ?
GEORGE: I do .
ERIN: Which number do you want , George ?
GEORGE: You got more than one ?
ERIN: Shit , yeah . I got numbers coming out of my ears . Like , for instance , ten .
GEORGE: Ten ?
ERIN: Sure . That 's one of my numbers . It 's how many months old my little girl is .
GEORGE: You got a little girl ?
ERIN: Yeah . Sexy , huh ? And here 's another five . That 's how old my other daughter is . Seven is my son 's age . Two is how many times I een married and divorced . You getting all this ? 16 is the number of dollars in my ank account . 454-3943 is my phone number . And with all the other numbers I gave you , I 'm guessing zero is the number of times you 're gon na call it .
GEORGE: How the hell do you know your bank balance ight off the top of your head like that ? See , that impresses me .
ERIN: Y'all got something you wan na discuss ?
ED: Damn it ! Brenda !
ERIN: How long 's she been crying like that ? Well , she 's got that tooth coming in
ED: Where 's Anna ?
ERIN: Out to lunch with the girls .
ED: Oh . Huh . Well , look , I got this file I need valued . Real estate thing . A lady has some property next to a PG & E plant that PG & E wants to buy . I need to know what to ask for it .
ERIN: Oh . Okay . He sees her staring at the box .
ED: You do know how to do that , do n't you ?
ERIN: Yeah . I got it . No problem .
ED: Good . Ed heads out , but pauses before leaving .
ERIN: Excuse me ?
ED: How come you 're not at lunch with the girls ? You 're a girl .
ERIN: I guess I 'm not the right kind .
ANNA: Erin , you 've been here three weeks . If you do n't know how to do your job by now , I am not about to do it for you .
ERIN: Ugh .
GEORGE: C'mon . I bought 'em for you , to make up fo that night .
ERIN: Return 'em . Maybe you 'll get your money ack . He gets up and follows her to her house .
GEORGE: Now , why 're you giving me such a hard time ? I 'm just trying to be a good neighbor .
ERIN: I had a good neighbor , George . She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids fo free . Something tells me you 're not gon na e able to measure up to that .
GEORGE: You need help with your kids ? I could probably do that .
ERIN: I 'm not gon na leave my kids with you .
GEORGE: Why not ?
ERIN: Cause I do n't even know you .
GEORGE: Yeah , and whose fault is that ? He 's got a point there . After a beat
KATIE: What 's that stand for ?
GEORGE: That 's for Harley Davidson . The best damn motorcycle ever made . Erin comes in from the kitchen .
ERIN: And if I catch either of you anywhere nea one , I 'll knock you silly . Go on to bed , now I 'll come tuck you in in a minute . They get up
GEORGE: Night .
ERIN: Yeah . I 'm probably ruining them .
GEORGE: How ?
ERIN: I 'm never here . I got ta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat .
GEORGE: I was serious before , you know . If you need someone to keep an eye on them afte school or something I do n't have a jo now , so I 'm around in the afternoons .
ERIN: Great . Another deadbeat .
GEORGE: I 'm not a deadbeat . I work when I need to .
ERIN: Yeah ? And what do you do the rest of the time , live off your trust fund ?
GEORGE: I do construction , which pays real good . And I make it last by living cheap .
ERIN: I hope that 's not supposed to impress me .
GEORGE: Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you ?
ERIN: It 's been a while . Maybe I 'm just out of practice .
GEORGE: Then lem me remind you , the polite thing is to say , thank you , that 's a real nice offer , I do n't mind taking you up on it .
ERIN: Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids ?
GEORGE: Cause I like kids . I like hanging out with them .
ERIN: Right . She starts cleaning up the cards .
GEORGE: I do . I like how they keep it all simple , you know ? They do n't get all complicated about life , like grown-ups do . A bicycle and an ice cream cone boom , done , they 're happy . Erin thinks about the offer .
ERIN: You 're around every afternoon ?
GEORGE: Yup . Usually working on my bike . No big deal . If it does n't work out , you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady . Tempting . Erin looks him over .
ERIN: This is n't gon na get you laid , you know .
GEORGE: Yeah , we 'll just see about that , wo n't we ?
ERIN: It was in this real estate file I 'm valuing . And see , I know they 're the medical ecords from the people selling the house ut it talks about things like lymphocytes and T8 suppressers .
JANE: What do I look like , Erin ? A library ? And Jane walks away with her coffee .
ERIN: Dr. Paulsen ?
PAULSEN: Yes ?
ERIN: Hi , I 'm Erin Brockovich . I was just over in the library there , asking a mess of questions about I guess they call it epidemiology ? and the fella there told me to find you , cause you know all about it .
PAULSEN: Is this a joke ? Did Baxter put you up to this ?
ERIN: Who 's Baxter ?
PAULSEN: He did , did n't he ? Baxter !
BAXTER: Yeah ?
PAULSEN: Oh . Oh .
ERIN: No one put me up to anything . I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions .
PAULSEN: Of course ! Oh , gosh , of course
ERIN: Right , I guess those are the kids
PAULSEN: They 've both got some immune system problem . Ca n't say what from , whether it 's viral o genetic or what , but something 's wrong . And these guys Donna and Peter
ERIN: Their parents , I 'm pretty sure .
PAULSEN: Well , from what this stuff says , I 'd say they both have some form of cancer .
ERIN: Hi . Donna Irving ?
DONNA: Yes ?
ERIN: I 'm Erin Brockovich , from Masry & Vititoe ?
DONNA: You 're a lawyer ?
ERIN: Hell , no . I hate lawyers . I just work fo them . You got a minute ?
DONNA: I added air conditioning , put in the pool , made all those pillows by hand
ERIN: Yeah ? I should learn to do stuff like that . They make the place feel real homey .
DONNA: Thank you . I think so too . That 's why I 'm eing such a stickler on this house price thing . I do n't mean to be a pain in PG & E 's ackside , especially after all they 've done for Hinkley , but I look around here and I think , if they want this place , they 're gon na have to pay for it . And I do n't just mean pay for the house ; I 'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over .
ERIN: Right .
DONNA: Cause first you got ta move , then there 's decorating , and if the windows are n't the same size , you know you 're making all new curtains . Honest to God , I do n't know if I have the energy . You know , I 've been sick . Me and Peter both have .
ERIN: Yeah , I 'm real glad you brought that up . I was going through your file here , and I ran into these medical records . They kinda surprised me
DONNA: I know . They 're more than a bit unusual . See , two years ago , Pete got Hodgkin 's disease . That 's a kind of cancer
ERIN: Yeah , I 'm real sorry to hear that .
DONNA: Thank you . It 's in remission now , thank the Lord , but you never know . And then while that 's going on , I end up having to have a hysterectomy . Plus a whole mess of lumps emoved from my breasts . All benign so far , ut still , no matter how positive you stay , an operation can still take it out of you .
ERIN: I 'll say . Holy moley .
DONNA: So the whole idea of selling the house do n't get me wrong , I 'd be glad to move to some better place , but if they are n't gon na pay us properly , I just do n't see the point .
ERIN: Yeah , I can see that . I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems are n't important , but how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff ? Donna tops off their iced teas .
DONNA: Are you kidding ? With how our lives are , if I start subdividing files , I 'll be sunk . I just kept all PG & E correspondence in one place .
ERIN: Right , but I 'm sorry , I do n't see why you were corresponding with PG & E about it in the first place .
DONNA: Well , they paid for the doctor 's visit .
ERIN: They did ?
DONNA: You bet . Paid for a check-up for the whole family . And not like with insurance where you pay , then wait a year to be reimbursed , either . They just took care of it . Just like that . We never even saw a bill .
ERIN: Wow . Why would they do that ?
DONNA: Cause of the chromium .
ERIN: The what ?
DONNA: The chromium . Well , that 's what kicked this whole thing off .
ERIN: What 's chromium ?
DONNA: It 's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there .
ERIN: Well , hell , maybe that 's why you all have een so sick
DONNA: I thought the same thing , right off the bat . That 's why we went to see the doctor . But hunh-uh . Turns out one 's got nothing to do with the other . She rifles through the box .
ERIN: Seems like an awful big coincidence you water being messed with and you being so sick .
DONNA: Not around here . This is a rough part of the world . Hard times , not a lot of money , not a lot of luck . It 's a challenge , staying healthy in a town like this . Heck , even our dogs up and die .
ERIN: What 're you doing ?
GEORGE: Better safe than sorry .
ERIN: You want some coffee , George ?
GEORGE: I 'm gon na put a dead bolt on your front door , too . This is n't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world , you know .
ERIN: Thanks for reminding me .
GEORGE: I guess we get what we pay for , huh ? Erin pours him some coffee , hands it to him .
ERIN: You think it could make you sick , living in a place like this ?
GEORGE: What do you mean ? George settles in , helps himself to sugar .
ERIN: I was talking to this lady she and he husband both got cancer , and she thinks it 's cause they live in a bad neighborhood . You think that 's possible ? That living in a bad neighborhood could give you cancer ? George laughs a little at the thought .
GEORGE: Man , I hope not . You got enough damn problems . But Erin 's still mulling it over .
ERIN: Hi , y'all how you doing today ?
MAN 1: Hangin ' in , baby . How about yourself ?
ERIN: I 'm okay , I 'm just fine . I was wondering could I maybe ask you a couple questions ?
PAULSEN: You did ? Erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag .
ERIN: Uh-huh . Spent the last few days knocking on doors . And you know what ? They 're not . I mean , they got problems , but none of this cancer stuff . And their pets are fine . So I do n't know I just ca n't shake the feeling that it was n't no multivitamin they put in the water .
PAULSEN: Well , if you 're talking about contamination , you 're getting out of my area of expertise . Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC . Paulsen reaches for a notepad , scrawls on it .
ERIN: Do n't go telling anyone . It 'll ruin my eputation .
FRANKEL: What kind of chromium is it ?
ERIN: There 's more than one kind ?
FRANKEL: Yes . There 's straight-up chromium does all kinds of good things for the body . There 's chrom 3 , which is fairly benign , and then there 's chrom 6 , hexavalent chromium , which , depending on the amounts , can be very harmful .
ERIN: Harmful , like how ? What would you get ?
FRANKEL: With repeated exposure to toxic levels God , anything , really respiratory disease , liver failure , heart failure , eproductive failure , chronic headaches , one or organ deterioration plus , of course , any type of cancer .
ERIN: So that stuff it kills people .
FRANKEL: Oh , yeah . Definitely . Highly toxic , highly carcinogenic . Bad , bad stuff .
ERIN: Well , how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley ?
FRANKEL: Have you been to the water board ?
ERIN: Hunh-uh . What 's that ?
FRANKEL: Every county has one . They keep records of anything water-related within thei jurisdiction . You should be able to find something there .
ERIN: County water board . All righty , thanks .
FRANKEL: Good luck . Oh I would n't advertise what you 're looking for if I were you His line continues over
ERIN: Whew ! Goddamn , that 's a heavy door .
ROSS: Oh , hey lem me give you a hand there .
ERIN: Thank you very much . Are n't you a gentleman ? Mr .
ROSS: Ross .
ERIN: Ross . Real pleased to meet you . I 'm Erin . She smiles . He ca n't believe his luck .
ROSS: Erin . Cool . What can I do for you , Erin ?
ERIN: Well , believe it or not , I am on the prowl for some water records .
ROSS: You come to the right place .
ERIN: I guess I did .
ROSS: You just tell me what you want to look at and I 'll be glad to dig 'em out for you .
ERIN: I wish I knew . It 's for my boss . He 's fighting his water bill , and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places . The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself . Would that be okay ?
ROSS: Heck , yeah . Come on back . Just gon na need you to sign in here
ERIN: Nope . Maiden .
ROSS: You 're married .
ERIN: Not anymore .
MATT: Our mom gives us sandwiches on Fridays .
GEORGE: That 's a sandwich .
KATIE: No , it 's not !
GEORGE: Sure it is . Here , I 'll show you .
ERIN: Where 's my stuff ? Anna looks up .
ANNA: Where 've you been ?
ERIN: What the fuck did you do with my stuff ?
ANNA: Do n't use language with me
ERIN: Someone stole my stuff .
JANE: Nice to see you , Erin . We 've missed you .
ERIN: I had photos of my kids , plus a mug
JANE: toothbrush , toothpaste , and a pair of hose . Here .
ERIN: What 's going on ?
JANE: There may be jobs where you can disappea for days at a time , but this is n't one of them . Here , if you do n't do the work , you do n't get to stay . She hands her the box . Erin does n't take it .
ED: Erin , you 've been gone for a week .
ERIN: I left a message . I 've been dealing with that real estate thing . I was gon na write up a whole damn report and
ED: That 's not how we work here . You do n't just leave a message and take off .
ERIN: What am I supposed to do , check in every two seconds ?
JANE: Yes . It 's called accountability .
ERIN: I am not talking to you , bitch .
JANE: Excuse me ?
ED: Okay , enough Now , look , Erin this incident aside , I do n't think this is the right place for you . So what I 'm gon na do is make a few calls on your behalf . Find you something else , okay ?
ERIN: Do n't bother .
ED: Come on , I 'm trying to help here .
ERIN: Bullshit . You 're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed . Fuck if I 'll help you do that . And she leaves .
MAILMAN: Here ya go , Miz Brockovich .
ERIN: What are you doing here ?
GEORGE: Fixing a leak under your sink .
ERIN: I did n't ask you to do that . Damn it , George , I do n't ask you to do things like that .
GEORGE: I 'm gon na clean it up .
ERIN: Ugh Jesus She jumps and brushes it off .
GEORGE: Yeah you had a whole family of those things hanging out back there .
ERIN: Damn it
GEORGE: Do n't worry about it , I 'll get it later .
ERIN: Come here , you little motherfucker
GEORGE: Hey , whoa relax
ERIN: GOD DAMN IT !
GEORGE: It 's a simple thing . Everybody gets them . All we got ta do is call an exterminator .
GEORGE: What ? But you been working so hard
ERIN: Does n't matter . Does n't make one bit of difference . Oh God , George , how 'd this happen to me ? How 'd I end up so so nothing ?
GEORGE: You 're not nothing , Erin .
ERIN: Well , I 'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gon na be . I was supposed to have one of those great lives , with everything all laid- out and perfect . I mean , hell I was Miss Wichita , for God 's sakes . Did I tell you that ? You live next door to a real live eauty queen . I still got the tiara . I kept it cause I thought it meant something . I thought it meant I was gon na do something great with my life . I thought it proved I was gon na grow up to be someone .
GEORGE: You are someone .
ERIN: No I 'm not . Look at me . I 'm not .
GEORGE: You 're someone to me . You 're someone real special to me .
ERIN: I 'm no good , George . I make people miserable .
GEORGE: Man . Even your earlobes are beautiful .
ERIN: Do n't be too nice to me , okay ? It makes me nervous .
ED: Brenda !
ERIN: Come on , baby . Maybe that 's Ed McMahon .
ED: I got an interesting call this afternoon . It was from a Dr. Frankel .
ERIN: Oh , yeah ?
ED: He wanted you to know the legal limit fo hexavalent chromium , is .05 parts pe million . And that at the rate you mentioned , .58 , it could be responsible fo the cancers in that family you asked about . The Irvings .
ERIN: Well , that was nice of him . Is n't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax ?
ED: Look , I 'm sorry . You were gone . I just assumed you were off having fun .
ERIN: Now , why in the hell would you assume that ?
ED: I do n't know . Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun .
ERIN: Boy , are you ever a shitty judge of people .
ED: So what 's the story on this thing ? This cancer stuff ?
ERIN: You wan na know , you got ta hire me back . I got a lot of bills to pay .
ED: Fine .
ERIN: They told her something , but it ca n't have een too specific , cause I talked to her , and she sure did n't think her water was bad .
ED: So what made you think it was ?
ERIN: It does n't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something 's wrong .
ED: What medical records ?
ERIN: The ones in the box of files . The box of files ? The one from your office ?
ED: I did n't see any medical records in there .
ERIN: Boy , you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then , huh ? And you fired me . Jesus .
ED: That document you found , the one that says it was the bad chromium you did n't happen to make a copy did you ?
ERIN: Course I did .
ED: Lem me see it , will you ?
ERIN: I want a raise . And benefits . Including dental .
ED: Look , Erin , this is not the way I do usiness , this extortion nonsense .
ERIN: Ten . There 's a lot of other places I could work .
ED: A ten percent raise and benefits . But that 's it . I 'm drawing the line .
ERIN: So far . But that place is a pig sty . I would n't be surprised if there 's more .
ED: Find out .
ERIN: There 's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town . It 's impossible .
MATTHEW: Well I hate it .
KATIE: I hate it too . I hate this trip .
ERIN: Oh , come on , where 's your sense of adventure ? We 're going someplace you neve een before .
KATIE: I 'm gon na hate it .
MATTHEW: Me too . She glances at them , frowns a little .
ERIN: You know what I 'm realizing for the first time ? You kids are a couple of downers . I mean , you are the real thing a couple of honest-to-God depresso-types . Who in the heck raised you , anyway ? Some kind of moron ?
KATIE: Yeah . A real moron .
ERIN: Some kind of half-wit , no-good , big-haired , imbo , I bet .
MATTHEW: Yeah .
ERIN: Thank God we got you away from her , huh ?
ROSS: You know what , Erin ? I got nothing but time here . Why do n't you let me do that for you , and you can get your kids some dinner .
ERIN: Ross you are an absolute angel . She hands Ross the STACK OF DOCUMENTS .
ED: Fax these to this number , okay ?
BRENDA: All of 'em ?
ED: All of them .
DONNA: An on-site monitoring well ? That means
ERIN: It was right up on the PG & E property ove there .
DONNA: And you say this stuff , this hexavalent chromium it 's poisonous ?
ERIN: Yeah .
DONNA: Well then it 's got ta be a different than what 's in our water , cause ours is okay . The guys from PG & E told me . They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine .
ERIN: I know . But the toxicologist I been talking to ? He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure . And everything you all have is on that list . Donna resists this idea hard .
DONNA: No . Hunh-uh , see , that 's not what the doctor said . He said one 's got absolutely nothing to do with the other .
ERIN: Right , but did n't you say he was paid by
DONNA: ASHLEY ! SHANNA !
SHANNA: How come ?
BRENDA: What 's she doing here ?
JANE: He hired her back . With a raise .
BRENDA: What ? ? Why ?
JANE: Well , let 's see . It 's not cause she 's smart , and it 's not cause she 's professional . That leaves
BRENDA: And dumb old me thought working hard and eing loyal was the way to get ahead .
ED: I 'm telling you , the minute Brenda sent the fax I 'm talking the second she pressed that send button PG & E claims department is on the phone to me , scheduling a meeting .
ERIN: So you think we got 'em scared ?
ED: It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice . Brenda pops her head in , ignores Erin .
BRENDA: David Baum from PG & E is at reception .
ERIN: Nice to see you again , too , Brenda . Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin .
BAUM: in the interest of putting this whole thing to rest , PG & E is willing to offer the Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home . Ed laughs a little in disbelief .
ED: 250,000 ?
BAUM: In terms of land value out in Hinkley , Mr. Masry , we feel it 's a more than fair price .
ED: What about in terms of medical expenses ? 250,000 does n't come close to what this family 's gon na have to spend on doctors .
BAUM: I understand they 've had a bad run of luck , health-wise , and they have my sympathies . But that 's not PG & E 's fault .
ED: You 're kidding , right ? Look at these readings for Christ 's sake . PG & E 's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells , on numerous occasions .
ERIN: breast cysts , uterine cancer , Hodgkin 's disease , immune deficiencies , asthma , chronic nosebleeds .
BAUM: A million things could have caused those problems . Poor diet , bad genes , irresponsible lifestyle . Our offer is final and more than fair .
ED: Wait a minute I thought we were negotiating here .
BAUM: 250,000 is all I 'm authorized to offer . Ed looks across at this pissant little kid .
ED: Jesus Christ . I will present your offer to my clients . I doubt they 'll accept it . As Ed starts out
BAUM: Mr. Masry , before you go off on some crusade , you might want to remember who it is you 're dealing with here . PG & E is a 28- illion dollar corporation .
ED: Thanks . I 'll keep it in mind .
ERIN: At least they made an offer .
ED: That was n't an offer . A million would 've een an offer . When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off , waste my time , it 's a fuck you .
ERIN: I do n't get why they 'd do that .
ED: Because they can . You heard that kid they have 28 billion dollars at thei disposal . They can afford to waste all the time in the world .
ERIN: And you ca n't ?
ED: What , you think I 'm made of money ?
BAUM: Hey , you know where I can get a cab ? My plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes .
ED: Tell you what , why do n't you go on over to eception , tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport .
BAUM: Hey , excellent . Thanks . Baum heads out to the reception area .
ERIN: Mr. Masry , Mario gets lost going to the athroom . They 'll be driving around the valley for hours .
ED: Yeah . Is n't that a shame ?
ERIN: Well I 'll be God damned .
ROSALIND: You 've been reading for hours .
ERIN: I 'm a slow reader , on account of the fact that I look at the word `` dog '' and see `` god '' .
ROSALIND: Hey , just so long as you see Him .
MANDY: Excuse me , are you Erin Brockovich ?
ERIN: Yeah . Who are you ?
TOM: I 'm Tom Brown . This is my wife Mandy . We used to live across the street from the Irvings . PG & E bought our house last year .
ERIN: Wow . How many were born like this ?
TOM: Twelve , maybe thirteen .
MANDY: When Donna told us about you , and what you told her about the chromium , we figured that might have something to do with this , too .
ERIN: It sure could , yeah . Thanks a lot . She tucks them into a file , as if that 's it .
MANDY: There 's something else , too .
ERIN: What ?
TOM: Well . Mandy here 's had nine miscarriages .
ERIN: Are you kidding ? My God
MANDY: I know . It 's an awful lot .
ERIN: I 'm surprised Donna did n't say anything .
TOM: She does n't know . No one does . It 's not something you want to talk about , you know ?
MANDY: I figured it musta been something I did , like when I smoked marijuana , maybe . O took birth control pills . But then Donna told me you thought this chromium might be to blame for her problems , so I figured
ERIN: Hey . You guys still awake ?
KATIE: It happens all the time .
ERIN: That 's not true ; we had dinner together just last night .
MATT: You were reading the whole time .
ERIN: I 'm sorry , pumpkins . I 'll try a whole lot harder to be around , okay ? I promise .
GEORGE: If it 's any consolation , I love you .
ED: It 's Sinatra 's world , we just live in it .
ERIN: Um you mind pulling over ? Just for a second ?
PETE: If PG & E messed with our water , why would they bother saying anything about it to us ? Why not just keep quiet about it ?
ED: To establish a statute of limitations . See , in a case like this , you only have a yea from the time you first learn about the problem to file suit . So PG & E figures , we 'll let the cat out of the bag tell the people the water 's not perfect ; if we can ide out the year with no one suing , we 'll e in the clear forever .
DONNA: But it was more than a year ago that they told us
ED: It 's okay . We 're not suing . All we 're doing is using this information to get you a real nice purchase price on your house , and get you two a comparable retroactive bonus added to your sale price . This way , and PG & E can still look good to their shareholders , cause they 're not involved in an ugly lawsuit ; all they 're doing is buying a little property . Roy looks up from his retainer agreement .
ROY: It does n't say here how much this whole thing 's gon na cost us .
ED: My fee 's forty percent of whatever you get awarded .
ERIN: Boy , do I know how you feel . First time I heard that number , I said you got to be kidding me . Forty God damn percent ?
ED: Erin
ERIN: I 'm the one who 's injured , and this joke who sits at a desk all day is gon na walk away with almost half my reward ?
ED: Erin
ERIN: Then I asked him how much he makes if I did n't get anything . They look at Ed . Well ?
ED: Then I do n't get anything either .
ERIN: And I realized , he 's taking a chance too .
ED: All right , then . Let 's hit the road .
ERIN: Mr. Masry , if you do n't mind my saying , you got a lot to learn about being friendly . These people just hired you as their lawyer . The least you could do is make a little pleasant conversation .
ED: So , what 's , uh what 's new ?
MANDY: You know that thing it says in here about ashes ?
ERIN: Uh-huh ?
MANDY: Well , this old neighbor of mine , Bob Linwood he ran the dairy on Community seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other . I just figured it was something in the genes . And you know how it is you do n't like to ask about things like that Erin listens , interested .
LINWOOD: Yeah ?
ERIN: I 'm Erin Brockovich . I work at the law firm that represents your former neighbors the Browns . They suggested I give you a call .
MARY: Yes , Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer . Neve smoked a day in his life , neither .
ERIN: Mrs. DeSoto said she was n't sure exactly what it was that you had
PETE: She 's not alone on that one .
LAURA: Well , they know what it is it 's called fibrous dysplasia
PETE: The bones start growing again . Gives he headaches like you would n't believe .
LAURA: they just do n't know what caused it .
ERIN: then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing you folks at the hospital from time to time too , so I thought I 'd just stop by . You must be Annabelle .
ANNABELLE: Uh-huh .
ERIN: Whew , are you ever a beauty . I mean , you must drive those boys crazy . Annabelle smiles a little .
ED: Hunh-uh . Absolutely not .
ERIN: That 's crazy why not ?
ED: Because I said no . Look the only reason PG & E 's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute . We add plaintiffs , and suddenly we 're in the middle of a toxic tort with a statute problem against a massive utility . No , thank you . They go into their office building .
ERIN: Okay , so here 's what I 'll do . I 'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels two of the nicest people you 'd ever hope to meet , who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer I 'll tell them we ca n't help them cause you do n't feel like working that hard .
ED: It 's not about working hard
ERIN: Bullshit .
ED: It 's about being realistic . Something like this , Erin it could take forever . They 're a huge corporation . They 'd completely bury us in paperwork . I 'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I . firm .
ERIN: who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it . The doors open . Ed gets off . Erin follows .
ED: I know how DNA works , Erin
ERIN: We can get these people . With a little effort , I really think we can nail thei asses to the wall .
ED: Oh , you do ? With all your legal expertise , you believe that ?
ERIN: Okay , fine . I do n't know shit about shit . But I know the difference He shuts his office door on her .
ED: Damn it .
ERIN: Four more . Eleven people . So far .
ED: You think there 's more ?
ERIN: Well I found one document at the wate oard that had a toxic test well reading from 1967 . A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then .
ED: This is a whole different ball game , Erin . A much bigger deal .
ERIN: Kinda like David and what's-his-name ?
ED: Kinda like David and what's-his-name 's whole fucking family . Okay , here 's the deal if , and only if , you find me the evidence to back all this up I 'll do it . I 'll take it on . She smiles victoriously .
ERIN: You 're doing the right thing , Mr. Masry .
ED: Yeah , yeah . Remind me of that when I 'm filing for bankruptcy .
ERIN: Course , gathering evidence now , that 's a ig job . A hell of a lot bigger than just filing . I 'm gon na be working a lot harde now , taking on a lot more responsibility He gives her a look . Knows what 's coming .
ED: What now ?
ERIN: Another raise would n't hurt . And with all the time I 'm gon na be spending on the road , I 'll probably be needing my own cel phone , wo n't I ?
GEORGE: You can buy 'em all the toys you want , but come Monday , when you split again , they 're still gon na be pissed . Erin looks over at him , weary .
ERIN: George , I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off . Could you please not give me a hard time about it ?
GEORGE: One toy per kid is doing something nice . Four is something else .
ERIN: Well , hell , I guess that 's it , then , huh ? They 're scarred for life . They 're gon na start holding up 7-11 's any day now .
GEORGE: I 'm just saying
ERIN: I know what you 're saying , and I do n't wan na hear it . I am doing the best I can . And she walks away from him .
BRENDA: For God 's sake , Erin , I can see you panties .
ERIN: Liar . I 'm not wearing any .
GEORGE: Come on , Erin . A job 's supposed to pay you ills , not put you in danger .
ERIN: I 'm not in danger . I have a dead bolt . Remember ?
GEORGE: Look , do n't take this the wrong way , but do n't you think you might be out of you league here ?
ERIN: No , see that 's exactly what those arrogant PG & E fucks want me to think that ecause they got all this money and power , we do n't stand a chance in hell against them . But you know what ? They 're wrong . She heads into the bedrooms .
GEORGE: It does n't have to be this complicated , Erin . There 's a lot of jobs out there .
ERIN: How would you know ?
GEORGE: You mind telling me what that 's supposed to mean ?
ERIN: Nothing .
GEORGE: If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job , just say so .
ERIN: I did n't say that .
GEORGE: Cause I can get a job . I will . And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again . Would that make you happy ?
ERIN: Keep your voice down .
GEORGE: I know what they can sleep through , Erin . I probably know it better than you . She gives him a glare , then leaves the room .
ERIN: Hey , Ross . Tell me something . Does PG & E pay you to cover their ass , or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ?
ROSS: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
ERIN: The fuck you do n't . No one calls me Pattee . That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could 've only found out about me from you . People are dying , Ross . You got document after document here , right under your nose , that says why , and you have n't said word one about it . I wan na know how the hell you sleep at night .
GEORGE: What do you want , a joke ?
ERIN: No , no jokes , I got ta pee . Just tell me about your day . What went on back there ?
GEORGE: Well , come to think of it , we did have a big event around here . Beth started talking .
ERIN: What ? Beth ? My Beth ?
GEORGE: Yeah . We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said , `` ball . ''
ED: Is that what I think it is ?
ERIN: She lived on the plume . You never know .
WOMAN 1: Yeah , that PG & E built . The whole time we thought it was algae that made it so green .
GEORGE: I 'm bored , and so are the kids .
ERIN: Just a few more minutes , then we can go . Take her , will you ?
DONNA: Erin , this here 's Frank Melendez . He works over at the compressor station Erin stops in her tracks , very interested .
ERIN: I 'm sorry . What were you saying ?
ED: You wan na talk about
ERIN: No .
MIKE: She was about to take a handful of these He shows them a bottle of prescription pills .
LAURA: I 'm embarrassed .
ERIN: That 's okay . I understand .
LAURA: It 's just the pain . It 's only getting worse . I ca n't be a good wife . I ca n't be a good mother .
ERIN: I 'm real sorry , Laura .
LAURA: Know what I always thought I wanted outta life , Erin ? A Jaguar .
ERIN: Jaguar 's a darn pretty car .
LAURA: I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car , it 'd mean everything else was fine . I do n't even know how much they cost .
ERIN: A lot . But you hang in there , maybe you 'll get one . Laura shakes her head .
LAURA: Would n't mean the same thing . Erin watches her sadly .
ERIN: They used the hex chrom here , in these cooling tanks , as an anti-corrosive . Then they dumped it here , in these six ponds .
ED: I do n't remember seeing any ponds up there .
ERIN: They covered 'em over . And not too carefully either , cause you dig one inch under the surface , and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock .
ED: And that 's what caused the contamination ?
ERIN: It did n't help , but no . The real problem 's on the bottom . She reaches for a document , reads from it .
ED: They skipped that step .
ERIN: I guess it was a little too inconvenient . So for fourteen years , this stuff flowed into the groundwater , free as you please .
ED: Jesus . I do n't even wan na ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk .
ERIN: For your information , Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them . That was his job .
ED: No shit .
ERIN: No Suddenly , her eyes pop out of her head
ED: Erin lem me tell you something . If I'da put three researchers on this , I would n't expect them to dig up all the information you got here . This is some damn good work .
ERIN: Yeah ? Then gim me another raise .
ED: Hey , I got a staff to pay , plus rent , plus I have n't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case , so you can quit hitting me up like I 'm rich or something .
ERIN: Do n't give me that . You 're gon na get plenty ich off of this , Mr. 40 percent . We got those PG & E fuckers by the balls here .
ED: We 've got the PG & E fuckers in Hinkley by the alls . But nobody 's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG & E fuckers in San Francisco .
ERIN: What do you mean ?
ED: PG & E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley .
ERIN: Oh , they knew . They had to know .
ED: Show me the document that proves that . She does n't have one .
ERIN: Jesus Christ , Ed you know , the more I work on this thing , the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is . Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer that built a pool for a town ,
ED: I like this case .
ERIN: Really ? It makes me sick .
ED: Me too . That 's why I like it . It 's been a long time since I had a case I cared about .
ERIN: You did n't care about my case ?
ED: I would now . He gives her a long look .
ERIN: Well , good , Ed . I like working with you too .
ED: When 'd you start calling me Ed ?
GEORGE: I 'm just saying we have one night to ourselves , why do we have to spend it here ?
ERIN: Cause it 's my office party . If you had an office , I 'd go to your party .
GEORGE: Which one ? Maybe they did n't think you were coming .
ERIN: God damn . I work so hard . The least they could do
GEORGE: Hey . Fuck 'em , babe . Who needs 'em , huh ?
ED: I 'll show you what we did back here
ERIN: That 's Ed .
GEORGE: Lock the door .
ERIN: No , I wan na say hi .
GEORGE: We 'll say hi later . Lock it . But Erin pulls away
ERIN: Come on , George , it 's a party .
JOEY: Your wife 's real pretty .
GEORGE: She 's not my wife .
ERIN: That is not what I 'm
GEORGE: Bullshit , Erin . Bullshit .
ERIN: Great . Excellent . Thank you very much . She leaves the room .
DONNA: I 'd got so used to having 'em come up enign , I guess I just did n't expect it . She looks down her shirt front .
ERIN: Sure you are . You 're just a happier woman , cause you do n't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire .
DONNA: We 're gon na get them , are n't we , Erin ? You got ta promise me we 're gon na get them .
ERIN: If they 've sent that little shmuck Baum again , I 'm gon na be real pissed off .
ED: From their tone of voice on the phone , I 'd say they 're taking us more seriously .
ERIN: Yeah , I heard that one before . Brenda leans her head in .
BRENDA: Mr. Sanchez , Mr. Webster , Mr. Buda , and Ms. Cooper , from PG & E are here .
ERIN: Jesus . They look like the Secret Service .
ED: They 're trying to intimidate us . Tell them to wait in the conference room .
MR. SANCHEZ: Counselors .
SANCHEZ: Let 's be honest , here . Two million dollars is more money than these people have eve dreamed of . Erin has no patience for this today .
ERIN: Oh , see , now that pisses me off . First of all we got more ' n a hundred plaintiffs . They may not be sophisticated , but they do know how to divide , and two million dollars is n't shit when it 's split between them .
ED: Erin But there 's no stopping her .
ERIN: And second of all these people do n't dream about being rich . They dream about eing able to watch their kids swim in a pool without worrying they 'll have to have a hysterectomy at age 20 , like Rosa Diaz a client of ours or have their spine deteriorate like Stan Bloom . Another client of ours . So before you come back here with another lame-ass offer , I want you to think eal hard about what your spine is worth , Mr. Buda or what you 'd expect someone to pay you for your uterus , Miss Sanchez then you take out your calculator and multiply that number by a hundred . Anything less than that is a waste of our time .
ANNA: Um , Erin ? Listen . Even though you 're not necessarily my favorite person in the world sometimes you 're not half-bad .
ERIN: I 'm gon na assume that was meant as a compliment , Anna , and just say thank you .
ED: Hey . A new plaintiff called , wants to meet you . I told him we 'd be out there Thursday .
ERIN: D'you get his name ? Course not . Jesus , Ed
ED: He said he 'd be at the gas station at six .
ERIN: Boy , this job takes me to some of the best damn places , huh ?
ATTENDANT: Yup .
ERIN: Someone 's following me .
ED: What ? Who ?
ERIN: Some guy in a truck he waited till I was alone , then he followed me , like , two miles . Jesus , I 'm shaking . Get me a beer . Ed gets up and heads toward the door .
ED: Beer , please .
ERIN: I do n't know . Big . Dark .
ED: He 's gone . Did you get a license plate ? Or a make ?
ERIN: No , Ed what with me running for my life , I did n't have time to check those things
ED: I was just asking . Are you all right ?
ERIN: Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine .
ED: Jesus , you look like shit . When was the last time you had a decent night 's sleep ?
ERIN: I think you should know there 's very few people in the world who do n't piss me off 90 percent of the time . You 're one of 'em .
ED: I 'm triple locking my door , so do n't even think of trying to take advantage .
ERIN: What are you doing ? Where 's George ?
KATIE: I do n't know .
ERIN: George ! She heads out .
GEORGE: Thinking .
ERIN: About what ?
GEORGE: About this .
ERIN: What 's that ?
GEORGE: It 's a pair of earrings . I saw 'em in the mall one day , and I thought , damn , those would look good on those beautiful earlobes . So I bought 'em . And I said to myself , next time Erin says something nice , does something nice , I 'll surprise her with 'em . Know how long ago that was ? Six months . In six months , you have n't said one nice thing to me . That 's a long time .
ERIN: I 'm sorry . I 'm just working so hard
GEORGE: I know . But still . Six months . I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend . Cause there may be men who do n't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return , but I 'm sure as shit not one of 'em .
ERIN: I ca n't leave my job , George .
GEORGE: Yeah , you can . You could just quit . People do it all the time .
ERIN: I ca n't . Look this job it 's the best thing that ever happened to me . I mean it . For the first time in my life , I got people especting me . Up in Hinkley , I walk into a oom and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say . I never had that . Ever . Do n't ask me to give it up . I need it .
GEORGE: More than you need me .
ERIN: I need it . He nods , then stands , to leave .
GEORGE: Maybe you did n't like who you were before , Erin , but I did . That 's who I fell in love with .
ERIN: You already packed up your stuff ?
GEORGE: I pretty much knew what your answer was gon na be .
ERIN: Wait here . She gets out .
JANE: Have you been logging on ?
ERIN: What ?
JANE: I moved payroll onto the computer . It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night .
ERIN: Now how 'm I supposed to do that when I 'm not in here most mornings and nights ?
JANE: You 're clever . I 'm sure you 'll think of something . Erin glares at her
ERIN: I do n't believe this
ED: I 'm sorry , I 'm gon na have to put you on hold for just one second here Do you mind ?
ERIN: Yeah , I mind . You bet your ass I mind .
ED: Oh , Jesus . You wan na tell me what the problem is here , or
ERIN: It 's my paycheck . Which I earned . Which I deserve . Which I should n't have to beg for . That fat-ass bitch wo n't give it to me .
ED: Erin , you 're a big girl . If you got a problem with Jane , work it out for yourself . I do n't have time to deal with
ERIN: Fuck you . Make time . Cause I bust my ass for you . I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet , for you . And what do you do for me ? Huh ? You see the way I 'm treated around here but have you ever stood up for me once ? Have you eve mentioned to everyone what good work I 'm doing ? Have you ever bothered saying , hey , Erin does n't get paid the most cause she has the best tits ; she gets paid the most cause she 's the best God damn employee I 've eve had ?
ED: Is that what you want ?
ERIN: I want my paycheck . By the end of the day .
ED: I 'll see what I can do .
ERIN: You might want to think real hard about the amount , too . My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now , cause I still do n't make enough to afford good child care . Makes me think about looking around for a job where I 'm appreciated , for shit 's sake . She storms out .
MATTHEW: Can I play roller hockey ?
ERIN: We 'll see .
MATTHEW: When ?
ERIN: Well , God damn it , Matthew Randy 's mom does n't work eighteen-hour days , and Randy 's dad did n't leave her , so figuring out who 's gon na take who where is a little easier ove at Randy 's house . Erin opens the door . A MESSENGER is there .
MESSENGER: Erin Brockovich ?
ERIN: Yeah ?
MESSENGER: Package from Masry & Vititoe .
ERIN: Believe it or not , I would 've been satisfied with just the check . Ed turns , sees her .
ED: Well , you go threatening to leave , I ca n't take any chances . You 're the only person around who understands what I 'm doing . Things come up , I got ta know I got someone to turn to . She sits , reading him .
ERIN: What kind of things come up ?
ED: Things like the head counsel for PG & E calling me with an offer . 20 million , plus attorney 's fees . Take it or leave it .
ERIN: Whoa . No shit .
ED: It 's about 50 thousand per plaintiff .
ERIN: So what are you thinking ?
ED: I 'm thinking I wish someone else had to make this decision . 50 thousand bucks is more than any othe California toxic plaintiff has gotten . Ever . But
ERIN: but it wo n't cover Annabelle Daniels 's medical bills .
ED: And it 's less than pocket change for PG & E .
ERIN: Do you think we 'd do better by going to trial ?
ED: Maybe . but maybe not . We still do n't have anything linking this to PG & E corporate . Plus , there 's the statute problem . Plus , we 're way short on manpower , so we 'd need to ing on more lawyers
ERIN: Plus , 40 percent of 20 million 's a whole lot of money .
ED: It 's eight million dollars , Erin . Eight million dollars . Beat .
ERIN: That 's a fucking fortune , Ed . And you know I 'm the last person on Earth to walk away from a big payday . But you and me did n't get into this to get rich . We did it cause we both have this voice in our heads saying , do the right thing ; get these plaintiffs what they deserve the right to live and die in some kind of comfort and peace . If 50,000 is n't gon na buy that , then we got ta say no . Trust me . If you do n't do the right thing for these people , getting that 6 million dollars is gon na feel like shit .
ED: I knew I put up with your bullshit for a eason .
ERIN: Holy shit . Who do they represent , God ?
ED: Do n't joke . They might . So do me a favo and behave yourself for once . Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter .
ERIN: Scuse me , sir , you got a real nice ass , you know that ?
THERESA: Ed . Good to see you again .
ED: Theresa , hey this is Erin Brockovich .
THERESA: Kurt , Ed Masry 's here . And this is Erin Brockovich , Ed 's assistant . Erin , this is Kurt Potter .
POTTER: Well . Now I know what you meant when you called her your secret weapon .
ED: Yesterday .
ERIN: What 's a demur ?
ED: It 's PG & E saying to the judge that we do n't have a case . Their lawyers go
POTTER: How many counts ?
ED: Sixty-nine . We 've got good answers to all of 'em .
ERIN: Counts ?
ED: Reasons PG & E thinks it should n't go to
POTTER: Who 's the judge ?
ED: Corey .
POTTER: Good .
ERIN: Why good ?
ED: He 's got a reputation for doing all his
POTTER: How long 's he gon na take ?
THERESA: You know what ? Why do n't I take Erin down the hall , so we can start in on this stuff ?
ERIN: Hey those are my files
THERESA: Yeah , we had them couriered over . And listen , good work . They 're a great start . We 're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research .
ERIN: Excuse me Theresa , was it ? There are no holes in my research .
THERESA: No offense . There are just some things we need that you probably did n't know to ask .
ERIN: Do n't talk to me like I 'm an idiot , okay ? I may not have a law degree , but I 've spent 18 months on this case , and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will .
THERESA: Erin . You do n't even have phone numbers fo some of them .
ERIN: Whose number do you need ?
THERESA: Everyone 's . This is a lawsuit . We need to e able to contact the plaintiffs .
ERIN: I said , whose number do you need ?
THERESA: You do n't know six hundreds plaintiffs ' numbers by heart .
ERIN: Annabelle Daniels . 714-454-9346 . As Theresa starts to write it down
THERESA: Okay , look I think we got off on the wrong foot here
ERIN: That 's all you got , lady . Two wrong feet . In fucking ugly shoes .
ED: Bullshit . It was a misunderstanding . But instead of handling it politely , instead of treating her with respect
ERIN: Why the fuck should I respect her ?
ERIN: Not in my world .
ED: Gee , I wonder why .
ERIN: Hey ! You 're my ride !
POTTER: I 've also been thinking about the team . Responsibilities , who should cover what
ED: Right .
POTTER: I think we should makes some changes .
ERIN: I know she is n't real warm , but they say she 's a real good lawyer
TED: That may be . But I do n't want her coming to the house again . She 's kinda stuck-up , and she upsets Annabelle . Now , I hate to say this , but when she left today , Rita asked if we should get a new lawyer .
ERIN: Ted , no do n't do that . If you do n't like Theresa , you do n't have to work with her . Me and Ed are still here for you .
TED: I called Ed two days ago , Erin , and he still has n't called me back .
BRENDA: Ed Masry 's office Sorry , he ca n't be interrupted .
ERIN: Do n't be a pain in the ass , okay , Brenda ? Just put him on .
BRENDA: I said , he ca n't be interrupted .
ROSALIND: Hey , Erin , I thought you were taking a sick day .
ERIN: So did I .
ROSALIND: Some meeting . With PG & E people .
ERIN: PG & Are you sure ?
ROSALIND: Yup . They must be important , too , cause they came on a special plane .
CORBIN: we would enter into binding arbitration judge , no jury with a settlement to be etween 50 and 400 million dollars . Ed and Potter hear this and think about it .
POTTER: Any preconditions on the settlements ?
CORBIN: The plaintiffs have to agree to it unanimously . And they 're barred from eve discussing their settlement with anyone .
ED: 50-400 million dollars is n't a whole hell of a lot of money for your company , Mr. Corbin .
HEAD COUNSEL: 50-400 million dollars is a great deal of money for your plaintiffs , Mr. Masry . As Ed mulls this , he sees , beyond Mr. Corbin ,
ED: Could I just take a brief break here fo a moment ? I 'll be right back . He gets up and goes out into
ERIN: If you tell me to relax , I 'm gon na kick you fucking head off
ED: Erin , it 's just a meeting .
ERIN: People do n't fly down in their own god damn plane for `` just a meeting ''
ED: Look , you said you were n't feeling great . I thought you should rest .
ERIN: Bullshit . You 'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you .
ED: Okay , look . It 's an important meeting . Kurt thought , if it was just lawyers
ERIN: Kurt thought ? What about you ? Do you think anymore ?
ED: Look , this is serious now . They 're talking serious money
ERIN: And , what , I 'm not serious ?
ED: You 're emotional . You 're erratic . You say any God damn thing that comes into you head . And I 'm not saying that 's bad . That can be great ; that can be a lot of fun
ED: Okay , now you 're making this personal , and it is n't
ED: No one 's taking anything
ERIN: Bullshit . You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me . After all I 've done for you , that 's the thanks I get .
ED: Do n't give me that . You 've gotten plenty . You 've been well-paid ; you 've gotten lots of perks
ERIN: Perks ? Jesus perks ?
MATTHEW: I 'm gon na go live with George .
ERIN: If you leave here real fast , I might not kill you .
MATTHEW: You always say that . Then you go to work and forget you promised .
ERIN: I never forget , honey . I try , real hard . It 's just , for some reason , I do n't seem to e able to organize things right and when it comes to you guys , I end up falling short .
MATTHEW: You never fall short for the work people . I guess maybe you just love them more .
ERIN: Oh , God , sweetheart , no . There 's nothing on Earth I love more than you . Nothing . I promise .
GEORGE: I 'm looking for Erin Brockovich . They ought her in in an ambulance ?
DOCTOR: It 's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain .
GEORGE: Jesus .
DOCTOR: She must be a tough cookie , cause it 's a pretty advanced case . I 'd say she 's been walking around with it for a few weeks now .
GEORGE: How does someone get meningitis ?
DOCTOR: Usually , in adults , it 's from exposure to acteria or a virus or
GEORGE: or lem me guess toxic waste ?
ERIN: They said that 'd be tomorrow . They just wan na keep an eye on me another night .
GEORGE: Fine . I 'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon . A moment of thick silence .
ERIN: Thank you .
GEORGE: Mm-hm .
ERIN: George , hang on . Look I 'm sorry . I just
GEORGE: I 'll drop 'em by tomorrow .
ERIN: If you 're here to fire me , your timing 's lousy .
ED: I 'm not gon na fire you . I wanted to . But then you got sick , and that woulda made me look like a shit . You embarrassed me , Erin .
ERIN: I know . I 'm sorry . Do I get to hear what happened anyway ?
ED: Uh-huh .
ERIN: And if you had to guess
ED: With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet , I 'd say we 'll end up on the lower end of that . Still a lot of money .
ERIN: So why would PG & E offer it ?
ED: Because . They know the evidence ; they know they 're gon na lose a jury trial . Maybe they would n't lose 400 million bucks , but once you factor in all they 'd spend on this case in the next ten years , it makes a lot of
ERIN: Wait , what do you mean , ten years ?
ED: Five years , maybe , for a trial . Double that for the appeal .
ERIN: I 'm sorry , are you saying that if this thing
ED: Hey , that 's not so bad . Compare it to the Love Canal that was twenty years ago , and those people still have n't seen a dime . So in legal terms , ten years is
ERIN: Fuck legal terms . We 're talking about human eings here . Sick people . A whole bunch of them are gon na be dead in ten years . They need their money now ! We got ta get 'em to agree to the arbitration , Ed . We got ta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to
ERIN: When ? Where ?
ED: Tuesday at seven , at the Hinkley firehouse .
ERIN: Okay , good . I think I should be the one to tell 'em , cause they trust me more than
ED: You 're not gon na be there .
ERIN: The fuck I 'm not . I do n't care what the doctor says
ED: This is n't doctor 's orders . It 's mine . I 'm saying you ca n't come .
ERIN: Why not ?
ED: Because Kurt does n't want to work with you . He thinks you 're a loose cannon .
ERIN: Fuck Kurt .
ED: Erin
ERIN: No , I 'm serious . You know what Kurt Potte is ? He 's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place . He 's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG & E offered 20 million . He does n't work like us , Ed . There 's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing . But his mind 's made up . He stands to leave .
ED: Do n't come , Erin . I mean it . If you do , I 'm gon na have to fire you . Just concentrate on getting well .
ERIN: Come on , kids , we 're going for a ride .
POTTER: Binding arbitration is n't all that different from a trial . It 's overseen by a judge . Evidence is presented in much the same way .
ERIN: Stay in the car , babies , I wo n't be long .
TOM BROWN: You do n't even know what it 's gon na be ; how do you know we 're gon na like it ? Agreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd .
MANDY BROWN: Which ? There 's a big difference there .
POTTER: I would n't want to speculate at this point .
MANDY BROWN: Ed what do you think it 'll be ?
ED: I think Kurt 's right . We should n't speculate .
MANDY BROWN: So then , what , that mystery number 's divided up at the whim of some judge
POTTER: Judges do n't make decisions based on whim , ma'am . They make them based on precedent and evidence .
ERIN: Fucking idiot
POTTER: Look . Everyone . Is this a big decision ? Absolutely . But I do believe that if you put a little faith in the system , you 'll be quite pleased with the outcome . Ted Daniels gets up from his seat .
TED DANIELS: Mr. Potter , if you knew me from Adam , you 'd know that being pleased is n't an option fo me anymore . Now do n't take this personally , sir , but I 've never seen you before in my life . I 'm not about to put my faith in anything just cause you tell me to .
ERIN: Can I have one of those counter thingies , please ?
GEORGE: They up ?
ERIN: Hunh-uh . Not yet . Look , do n't take any of 'em on your bike , okay ? Call a cab if you wan na go somewhere . She hands him a wad of cash .
GEORGE: How long 's this whole thing gon na take ?
ERIN: I do n't know . Few days . Thanks for helping me . I appreciate it .
GEORGE: Yeah , well good help is hard to find .
ERIN: I treated you real bad , George . I know that . But , my problem was I never been with anyone who deserved better than that . You 're the first nice guy who ever liked me .
GEORGE: Think you could learn ?
ERIN: You know me . I pick things up real fast .
GEORGE: You should n't be driving around , you know . You 're sick .
ERIN: Yeah , but I 'm gon na get better . A lot of these folks are n't .
DONNA: I do n't know , Erin the way he was talking to us , telling us everything was gon na be fine I just did n't trust him .
PETE: And after all we been through no jury , no appeal . It just makes me nervous .
ERIN: I understand all that . And I do n't wan na force you into anything . If you do n't want to sign , that 's fine . But why do n't we talk it over a little , cause I 'd sure hate fo you to turn this down for the wrong reasons .
DONNA: For what ?
ERIN: Well , I was gon na head over to the Browns now . I was thinking Mandy really values your opinion
RITA: I thought so , too , but Erin says a trial 's gon na take years
ERIN: What time is it ?
GEORGE: Real early . We 're just gon na take your ca to get some breakfast . Erin forces herself awake .
ERIN: No , I need my car
GEORGE: We 'll just be a minute . Get a little more sleep .
ERIN: Oh , baby , please do n't play with that , okay ? I got 'em all organized . Just put it back .
MATTHEW: This girl 's the same age as me .
ERIN: That 's right , sweetheart . She replaces the form on top of the stack .
MATTHEW: She 's one of the sick people ?
ERIN: Yeah . She is . But you know what ? That 's why I 'm helping her . So she can get some medicine to make her feel better . Matthew mulls this over a bit more .
MATTHEW: How come her own mom is n't helping her ?
ERIN: Cause her own mom 's real sick , too .
MATTHEW: Maybe we 'll bring you back some breakfast . You want eggs ?
ERIN: Eggs 'd be great , baby . Eggs 'd be perfect .
DARK GLASSES: If PG & E made someone destroy a whole lot of documents would that matter to you ?
ERIN: Well I guess that depends on what the documents were . I 'm sorry I did n't get your name .
DARK GLASSES: Embry . Charles Embry .
EMBRY: I was working in the compressor , and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says , we 're gon na give you a shredder machine , and send you on down to the warehouse . We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there .
ERIN: Did he say why ?
EMBRY: Nope . And I did n't ask .
ERIN: Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed ?
EMBRY: Well , it 's pretty boring work , shredding you got ta find some way to entertain you mind . So yeah , I took a look .
ERIN: And ?
EMBRY: There was a lot of dull stuff vacation schedules , the like . But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds . The water in them . They had eadings from test wells , stuff like that .
ERIN: And you were told to destroy those ?
EMBRY: That 's right .
ERIN: What do you mean ?
EMBRY: Well . There were a few documents that I somehow did n't get around to shredding . That I kept instead . Erin stops , mid-bite .
ERIN: How come you did n't say anything when you found these things ?
EMBRY: At the time , I thought , I got six kids , some of 'em want to go to college . I ca n't afford to lose my job . I told myself I was eing honorable . But there 's nothing honorable in what I did . Maybe that 's why they picked me for the job . Maybe they knew what kind of man I was .
ERIN: Hey , Ros , where are they ?
ROSALIND: In the conference
ERIN: Morning !
ED: Erin ? What are you
ERIN: You know what , Mr. Potter ? I completely forgot your birthday this year . And seeing as how you 've been so good to me , I think that is a terrible oversight . So what I een doing over the last few days is I 've een putting together a present for you .

ED: I was wrong .
ERIN: Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself .
ED: I did . Both .
ERIN: Say you 'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I did n't up and quit over all this .
ED: The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe , Erin . The luckiest son of a bitch in history .
ERIN: How do you know that ?
ED: Cause you got a little voice in your head saying , do the right thing . Give him another chance .
ERIN: How you feeling today ? Donna turns , sees her . Smiles .
DONNA: It 's a good day . I feel good .
ERIN: Well , then if you 're feeling up to it , maybe we should talk shop . Erin sits down on a rock .
DONNA: A number for the whole group , or for us ?
ERIN: Both . Donna sits down next to her .
DONNA: Oh , my God .

ERIN: Ed , I swear , I 'm not
ERIN: What is that ?
ED: Take it . Erin does . Looks at it . Her eyes bug out .
ERIN: Two million dollars ?
ED: The firm took in sixty . That 's three percent . Seemed like a fair bonus to me .
FEMALE NARRATOR: Forces hostile to the United States grow strong in the late 20th Century .
FEMALE NARRATOR: Fearing a massive terrorist invasion from South America , the United States prepares for war . The Great Wall is built along the southern border , cutting off the flow of illegal aliens .
POLICE ANCHOR: He 's been the Force 's Most Wanted Man fo 10 years . Convicted of 27 moral crimes . I can tell you , the excitement around here is Here he comes !
BRAZEN: Commander Malloy . They 're bringing him out , sir .
MALLOY: So we finally got him .
POLICE ANCHOR: Hold one ! The door is opening !
PLISSKEN: Call me Snake .
BRAZEN: ComStat did a psychosearch on him . Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities . He hit the bottom of the curve .
MALLOY: Perfect for the mission . Nobody else can pull it off - not an army , not a man .
BRAZEN: Zero emotional developments . Total lack of compassion . A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive .
3RD MAN: Let 's get this over with .
MALLOY: How you doin ' Plissken ? You like the watch ?
PLISSKEN: You assholes did n't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service . What'ya want ?
3RD MAN: Get to it .
MALLOY: At 1030 hours Wednesday , a group of government officials began a tour of the Livermore Defense Lab . The President 's daughter , Utopia , was among them .
UTOPIA: To the American people - it is time to ise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror .
MALLOY: At 1140 hours , she hijacked the plane . We scanned the videotape on VR . Check it out .
UTOPIA: Today is Day One of a brand new world . The days of the empire are finished . To the President - my father , you know what this is .
CONGRESSMAN: Utopia , please . Give us the prototype . If something should happen -
UTOPIA: It will be in my hands - and the hands of my lover .
MALLOY: Somehow during the tour , she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device . We do n't know how .
BRAZEN: Utopia became depressed after her mother 's suicide , began to withdraw into he virtual reality simulator . She 'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time . Somebody else was in there with her .
MALLOY: Cuervo Jones . Shining Path . Peruvian terrorist . Runs the biggest baddest gang in L.A .
BRAZEN: Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences , then tried to erase them . She missed this fragment on the end of her last tape . Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR master data bank - and then went prowling around for innocent blood , someone vulnerable to corrupt . Utopia was lonely , looking for something to believe in .
PLISSKEN: Sad story . You got a cigarette ?
MALLOY: Shut up , Plissken .
PLISSKEN: What 's the little black box do ?
MALLOY: Top secret . Only on a need to know .
PLISSKEN: And I do n't need to know . So fuck you , I 'm goin ' to Hollywood .
MALLOY: That 's right , big shot . Unless you do what we want you 're not coming back .
PLISSKEN: So what 's the deal , huh ? Go into L.A. , find the President 's daughter , secure the ox , and bring 'em both out - and I 'm free ?
MALLOY: That 's the deal .
PLISSKEN: Tell the President to adopt . I think I 'll like L.A .
3RD MAN: If you bring out the prototype , you 'll eceive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in the United States . Just like in '97 . Remember New York , Plissken ?
PLISSKEN: Who are you ?
MALLOY: It 's the President , for Christ 's sake !
PRESIDENT: I give you my word . Put the prototype into my hands , and you 're a free man .
PLISSKEN: I can see you 're real concerned about you daughter .
PRESIDENT: Utopia is lost to me . My daughter is gone .
PLISSKEN: Well , I 'll think it over .
PRESIDENT: You 're running out of time .
PLISSKEN: I 've been doin ' that all my life . Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is .
MALLOY: Well , enjoy it , war hero , cause you got 10 hours to live .
PLISSKEN: Wait a minute , what are you talkin ' about ?
MALLOY: Having second thoughts ?
PLISSKEN: Maybe . But you 're not putting any shit in me this time .
MALLOY: You do n't understand . It 's already in you .
MALLOY: The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop . She injected you with incentive toxin . Right now it 's swimming in your bloodstream . It 'll start to take effect in 9 hours .
BRAZEN: It 's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus . Genetically engineered . 100 % pure death . Complete nervous system shutdown . You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig . Not a pretty sight .
MALLOY: Of course there 's an anti-toxin . Neutralizes the virus immediately upon injection . We 'll give it to you , but you have to do us this little favor .
PRESIDENT: Did n't think we were that stupid , did you ?
MALLOY: We 're holographs .
PLISSKEN: Get this crap out of me .
MALLOY: I guess we have a deal . Nice to be working with you , Plissken .
PLISSKEN: Call me Snake .
BRAZEN: Very sweet little weapon . Core burner . Magnesium ammo . 500 extra rounds . Two 9mm handguns . Oral projectile . Mouth dart . Hold it in your mouth for ten seconds , the coating dissolves , it becomes a weapon .
MALLOY: Tracer . Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted in her arm . You can locate her with this .
BRAZEN: This clips right onto your 9mm . Ammo enhancers . Like miniaturized grenades . Blows through anything .
MALLOY: L.A. is in a constant state of warfare . Gangs fighting for the right to rule .
BRAZEN: Heavy Third World connections . They get weapons , drugs , fuel , choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south .
MALLOY: Some areas have power - they 're on line to San Onofre .
PLISSKEN: I 'll need to know more about this thing .
MALLOY: Only a handful of people are aware of its existence . Let 's just say it 's the ultimate defensive weapon .
PLISSKEN: Defense against what ?
MALLOY: There 's a war about to be declared , o did n't you know ?
PLISSKEN: So what does this thing do ?
MALLOY: All you need to know is get it back here y 5 a.m .
PLISSKEN: Where do I put ashore ?
MALLOY: Cahuenga Pass . Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl . You should be able to pick up Utopia 's tracer there . Once you go inside , you 're on your own . You know what you have to do with the girl , do n't you ? We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason .
PLISSKEN: So you want me to take her out ? Is that an order from the President ?
MALLOY: Let 's just say it 's what 's best for the country .
PLISSKEN: By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin ?
MALLOY: A medical team will be standing by .
PLISSKEN: Not you ?
MALLOY: No .
PLISSKEN: Good .
MALLOY: Thought you might try that . First clip is filled with blanks . Goodbye , Plissken .
PLISSKEN: She 's in the green .
MALLOY: Plissken , watch your speed . Lots of obstructions down there .
BRAZEN: His reactor 's starting to overheat .
MALLOY: Plissken , slow down the sub . You 're overloading the power plant .
PLISSKEN: I 'm here .
PIPELINE: Too bad about your boat , man . Supposed to be some swells out here tonight . Big ones . You like to surf ?
PLISSKEN: Which way to the Hollywood Bowl ?
PIPELINE: Down that way .

BLONDE HOOKER: It 's winnin ' time , baby . How about you and I do some celebrating ?
PLISSKEN: What 's going on ?
BLONDE HOOKER: You must be new around here . You look familiar . Have I done you before ?
PLISSKEN: What 's happening ?
BLONDE HOOKER: Easy , man , easy . It 's Cuervo Jones ' gang . Mescalito Justice . He 's the big boss man 'round here tonight . He 's gon na take down the police and make 'em kiss his fine ass .

TASLIMA: The freeway .
PLISSKEN: I know that . There are people in some of these cars .
TASLIMA: It 's where they live . I guess afte everything happened , they just needed to do what they 'd always done before . During the daytime , they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep .

CLEMENTINE: I do n't care .
MIERZWIAK: You guess he 's your boyfriend ? Or you guess you 're having a bad time with hm ?
CLEMENTINE: What ? No . I do n't like the term oyfriend . It 's so gay .
MIERZWIAK: I think I know . I think we can help . Why do n't you start by telling me about you elationship . Everything you can think of . Everything about him . Everything about you . And we 'll take it from there . She nods , thinks .
CLEMENTINE: Um , well , he 's a fucking tidy one
JOEL: Hi , Cindy . Joel . Listen , I 'm not feeling well this morning . No . Food poisoning , I think . Sorry it took me so long to call in , but I 've been vomiting .
WAITRESS: Coffee ?
CLEMENTINE: God , yes . You 've saved my life ! The waitress pours the coffee .
WAITRESS: You know what you want yet ?
CLEMENTINE: Ai n't that the question of the century . The waitress is not amused .
WAITRESS: Yeah . We 're having a run on it .
CLEMENTINE: And some cream , please .
JOEL: I 'm sorry .
CLEMENTINE: Why ?
JOEL: Why what ?
CLEMENTINE: Why are you sorry ? I just said hi .
JOEL: No , I did n't know if you were talking to me , so She looks around the empty car .
CLEMENTINE: Really ?
JOEL: Well , I did n't want to assume .
CLEMENTINE: Aw , c'mon , live dangerously . Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car .
JOEL: Anyway . Sorry . Hi .
CLEMENTINE: It 's okay if I sit closer ? So I do n't have to scream . Not that I do n't need to scream sometimes , believe me . But I do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to write or something .
JOEL: No , I mean , I do n't know . I ca n't really think of much to say probably .
CLEMENTINE: Oh . So
JOEL: I mean , it 's okay if you want to sit down here . I did n't mean to
CLEMENTINE: No , I do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to
JOEL: It 's okay , really .
CLEMENTINE: Just , you know , to chat a little , maybe . I have a long trip ahead of me . How far are you going ? On the train , I mean , of course .
JOEL: Rockville Center .
CLEMENTINE: Get out ! Me too ! What are the odds ?
JOEL: The weirder part is I think actually I ecognize you . I thought that earlier in the diner . That 's why I was looking at you . You work at Borders , right ?
CLEMENTINE: Ucch , really ? You 're kidding . God . Bizarre small world , huh ? Yeah , that 's me book slave there for , like , five years now .
JOEL: Really ? Because
CLEMENTINE: Jesus , is it five years ? I got ta quit ight now .
JOEL: because I go there all the time . I do n't think I ever saw you before .
CLEMENTINE: Well , I 'm there . I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible . You have a cell phone ? I need to quit right this minute . I 'll call in dead .
JOEL: I do n't have one .
CLEMENTINE: I 'll go on the dole . Like my daddy efore me .
JOEL: I noticed your hair . I guess it made an impression on me , that 's why I was pretty sure I recognized you .
CLEMENTINE: Ah , the hair . Blue , right ? It 's called Blue Ruin . The color . Snappy name , huh ?
JOEL: I like it .
CLEMENTINE: Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering .
JOEL: Yeah . Tom Waits says it in
CLEMENTINE: Exactly ! Tom Waits . Which song ?
JOEL: I ca n't remember .
CLEMENTINE: Anyway , this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names . Red Menace , Yellow Fever , Green Revolution . That 'd be a job , coming up with those names . How do you get a job like that ? That 's what I 'll do . Fuck the dole .
JOEL: I do n't really know how
CLEMENTINE: Purple Haze , Pink Eraser .
JOEL: You think that could possibly be a full time job ? How many hair colors could there be ?
CLEMENTINE: Someone 's got that job . Agent Orange ! I came up with that one . Anyway , there are endless colo possibilities and I 'd be great at it .
JOEL: I 'm sure you would .
CLEMENTINE: My writing career ! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski . The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs .
JOEL: You sure ? That does n't sound
CLEMENTINE: I think . Anyway , I 've tried all thei colors . More than once . I 'm getting too old for this . But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality . I apply my personality in a paste . You ?
JOEL: Oh , I doubt that 's the case .
CLEMENTINE: Well , you do n't know me , so you do n't know , do you ?
JOEL: Sorry . I was just trying to be nice .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah , I got it . There 's a silence .
JOEL: I 'm Joel .
CLEMENTINE: No jokes about my name ? Oh , you would n't do that ; you 're trying to be nice .
JOEL: I do n't know any jokes about your name .
CLEMENTINE: Huckleberry Hound ?
JOEL: I do n't know what that means .
CLEMENTINE: Huckleberry Hound ! What , are you nuts ?
JOEL: I 'm nut nuts .
CLEMENTINE: Oh my darlin ' , oh my darlin ' , oh my darlin ' Clementine ? No ?
JOEL: Sorry . It 's a pretty name , though . It means `` merciful '' , right ?
CLEMENTINE: Yeah . Although it hardly fits . I 'm a vindictive little bitch , truth be told .
JOEL: See , I would n't think that about you .
CLEMENTINE: Why would n't you think that about me ?
JOEL: Oh . I do n't know . I was just I do n't know . I was You seemed nice , so
CLEMENTINE: Now I 'm nice ? Do n't you know any othe adjectives ? There 's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative mumpish .
JOEL: Well , anyway Sorry . They sit in silence for a while .
CLEMENTINE: I just do n't think `` nice '' is a particularly interesting thing to be . The conductor enters the car .
CONDUCTOR: Tickets .
CLEMENTINE: What is nice , anyway ? I mean , besides an adjective ? I guess it can be an adverb , sort of .
JOEL: Okay .
CLEMENTINE: Shit . Shit . I know it 's here . Hold on .
CONDUCTOR: Next stop Southampton .
CLEMENTINE: Joel ? It 's Joel , right ?
JOEL: Yes ?
CLEMENTINE: I 'm sorry I yelled at you . Was it yelling ? I ca n't really tell . Whatever , I 'm a little out of sorts today .
JOEL: That 's okay .
CLEMENTINE: My embarrassing admission is I really like that you 're nice . Right now , anyway . I ca n't tell from one moment to the next what I 'm going to like . But ight now I 'm glad you said , `` that 's okay '' to me . That was nice of you .
JOEL: It 's no problem . Anyway , I have some stuff I need to
CLEMENTINE: Oh , okay . Well , sure , I 'll just Take care , then .
JOEL: Probably see you at the book store .
CLEMENTINE: Unless I get that hair-color-naming job . Clementine sits and stares out the window .
JOEL: Hi . I could give you a ride if you need .
CLEMENTINE: No , that 's okay . Thanks , though .
JOEL: You 're sure ? It 's cold .
CLEMENTINE: I do n't want to take you out of your way .
JOEL: It 's okay .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah ? He pulls over . She climbs in . They drive .
JOEL: Where do you live ?
CLEMENTINE: You 're not a stalker or anything , right ?
JOEL: Well , I probably would n't say if I were , ut no .
CLEMENTINE: You ca n't be too careful . I 've been stalked . I 've been told I 'm highly stalkable . I do n't need that .
JOEL: I 'm not a stalker .
CLEMENTINE: You know Wilmont ?
JOEL: Yeah .
CLEMENTINE: Wilmont . Near the high school . Joel turns . They drive in silence .
JOEL: It 's okay . I did n't think you were . There 's a silence .
CLEMENTINE: So you like bookstores , huh ?
JOEL: I like to read .
CLEMENTINE: Me too . It is Rain Dogs , by the way .
JOEL: Yeah ? I ca n't remember that album very well . I remember liking it . But
CLEMENTINE: The song 's 9th and Hennepin . I spent most of the train ride trying to emember . `` Till you 're full of rag wate and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who 'll listen . '' Remember ?
JOEL: Sort of , um
CLEMENTINE: Remember ? `` And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I 'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat '' Oh , shit . I 'm so stupid . Sorry .
JOEL: What ?
CLEMENTINE: I 'm just a bit of a wreck . `` I sleep in your hat '' makes me cry . Me . Joel pulls over .
JOEL: Well , I would n't want to be
CLEMENTINE: Oh , geez , I 'm full of shit . I already told you that . Anyway . See Ya . Clementine opens the car door .
JOEL: Take care .
CLEMENTINE: Hey , do you want to have a drink ? I have lots of drinks . And I could
JOEL: Um
CLEMENTINE: Never mind . Sorry , that was stupid . I 'm embarrassed . Good night , Joel .
JOEL: Very much .
CLEMENTINE: This someone gave that to me , just like , recently . I like it , too . I like crows . I think I used to be a crow . She caws and hands Joel a drink .
JOEL: Thanks . That was good , that crow sound .
CLEMENTINE: Do you believe in that stuff ? Reincarnation ?
JOEL: I do n't know .
CLEMENTINE: Me neither . Oh , there 's an inscription on the back . The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued .
JOEL: Frost ?
CLEMENTINE: Yeah . I 'm not , like , a Robert Frost lover by any stretch . His stuff seems strictly grade school to me . But this made me cry for some reason . Maybe ecause it is grade school . Y'know ?
JOEL: It 's pretty .
CLEMENTINE: I miss grade school . I do n't know why I 'm calling it grade school all of a sudden . When I went we called it elementary school . But I like grade school better . Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it . I 'd like to be from then . Everyone wore hats . Anyway , cheers !
JOEL: Cheers .
CLEMENTINE: God , that feels so fucking good . Take yours off .
JOEL: I 'm fine .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah ? Well , have a seat , anyway .
JOEL: No , I 'm okay for now . She heads toward the kitchen with her glass .
CLEMENTINE: Well , I 'm ready . Put some music on . Joel crosses to the CD 's and studies them .
JOEL: What do you want to hear ?
CLEMENTINE: No , stay . Just for a little while . Refill ?
JOEL: No . I
CLEMENTINE: I know a man who needs a refill .
JOEL: Thanks .
CLEMENTINE: Drink up , young man . It 'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant . Joel looks a little alarmed .
JOEL: Yeah ?
CLEMENTINE: Well , I go to a psychic and she 's always telling me I 'm psychic . She should know . Do you believe in that stuff ?
JOEL: I do n't know .
CLEMENTINE: Me neither . But sometimes I have premonitions , so , I do n't know . Maybe that 's just coincidence . Right ? Y'know , you think something and then it happens , or you think a word and then someone says it ? Y'know ?
JOEL: Yeah , I do n't know . It 's hard to know .
CLEMENTINE: Exactly . Exactly ! That 's exactly my feeling about it . It 's hard to know . Like , okay , but how many times do I think something and it does n't happen ? That 's what you 're saying , right ? You forget about those times . Right ?
JOEL: Yeah , I guess .
CLEMENTINE: But I think I am . I like to think I am .
JOEL: Sorry . My life is n't that interesting . I go to work . I go home . I do n't know what to say .
CLEMENTINE: Oh . Does that make you sad ? Or anxious ? I 'm always anxious thinking I 'm not living my life to the fullest , y'know ? Taking advantage of every possibility ? Just making sure that I 'm not wasting one second of the little time I have .
JOEL: I think about that .
CLEMENTINE: You 're really nice . I 'm sorry I yelled at you before about it . God , I 'm an idiot .
JOEL: I do have a tendency to use that word too much .
CLEMENTINE: I like you . That 's the thing about my psychic thing . I think that 's my greatest psychic power , that I get a sense about people . My problem is I never trust it . But I get it . And with you I get that you 're a really good guy .
JOEL: Thanks .
CLEMENTINE: And , anyway , you sell yourself short . I can tell . There 's a lot of stuff going on in your brain . I can tell . My goal can I tell you my goal ?
JOEL: Yeah .
CLEMENTINE: What 's the goal , Joel ? My goal , Joel , is to just let it flow through me ? Do you know what I mean ? It 's like , there 's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we 're all taught we should be consistent . Y'know ? You love someone that 's it . Forever . You choose to do something with your life that 's it , that 's what you do . It 's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through . And my feeling is that 's how you die , because you stop listening to what is true , and what is true is constantly changing . You know ?
JOEL: Yeah . I think so . It 's hard to
CLEMENTINE: Like I wanted to talk to you . I did n't need any more reason to do it . Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist ?
JOEL: Yeah .
CLEMENTINE: You 're very nice . God , I have to stop saying that . You 're nervous around me , huh ?
JOEL: No .
CLEMENTINE: I 'm nervous . You do n't need to be nervous around me , though . I like you . Do you think I 'm repulsively fat ?
JOEL: No , not at all .
CLEMENTINE: I do n't either . I used to . But I 'm through with that . Y'know , if I do n't love my body , then I 'm just lost . You know ?
JOEL: Oh , yeah .
CLEMENTINE: That made me cry . But , anyway , we went up to Boston , because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River . It gets frozen this time of year .
JOEL: That 's scary sounding .
CLEMENTINE: Exactly ! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again , so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me , but I was really disappointment to be there with him . Y'know ? And that 's where psychic stuff comes in . Like , it just is n't right with him . Y'know ?
JOEL: I think so .
CLEMENTINE: I do n't believe in that soulmate crap anymore , but he says so many great things . We like the same writers . This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to . And he 's cute . It 's fucked up . Joel , you should come up to the Charles with me sometime .
JOEL: Okay .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah ? Oh , great ! She sits closer to him .
JOEL: Sounds good . But right now I should go .
CLEMENTINE: You should stay .
JOEL: I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow , so
CLEMENTINE: Okay .
JOEL: Yes .
CLEMENTINE: You 'll call me , right ?
JOEL: Yeah .
CLEMENTINE: When ?
JOEL: Tomorrow ?
CLEMENTINE: Tonight . Just to test out the phone lines and all .
JOEL: Okay .
AL 1718?: I have to follow through with this . I have no choice .
RECORDED VOICE: We 're sorry , the number you have dialed is no longer in service . If you think you have reached this recording in erro
JOEL: I should maybe talk to you .
PATRICK: I just thought I 'd say hi . I was in the neighborhood .
CLEMENTINE: You were not .
PATRICK: I was not .
CLEMENTINE: Come over after I 'm done here ?
PATRICK: I ca n't . I want to , but I have to study .
CLEMENTINE: You rat .
PATRICK: I really want to , but tonight 's important . Test tomorrow .
JOEL: How could she have done this to me ? How could anyone do this to anyone ?
CLEMENTINE: You did n't say anything about my hair .
PATRICK: It 's so cool . You 're by far the most sensational person in the room .
CLEMENTINE: In the room ?
PATRICK: In the world .
JOEL: What 's happening here ? Oh , God ! I have to go home . They 'll be there soon . Joel turns to leave .
MARY: Hello again , Mr. Barish . Good , you 've got your stuff .
MIERZWIAK: Ah , Mr. Barish . This is Stan . He 'll be in charge of your procedure tonight . Stan nods professionally .
STAN: Mr. Barish .
JOEL: How exactly is this going to work tonight ?
MIERZWIAK: We 'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards There is an emotional core to each of our memories As we eradicate this core , it starts its degradation process By the time you wake up in the morning , all memories we 've targeted will have withered and disappeared . Like a dream upon waking .
JOEL: Is there any sort of risk of brain damage ?
MIERZWIAK: Well , technically , the procedure itself is brain damage , but on a par with a night of heavy drinking . Nothing you 'll miss .
JOEL: It 's happening now ! I 'm already in my ain . Mierzwiak looks at the fading room .
MIERZWIAK: Yes , I suppose you are . So , let 's get started If we want the procedure underway tonight , we have some work to do .
STAN: We use the articles you brought to create a map of Clementine in your brain . Tonight while you sleep we 'll be able to trace the map and erase .
JOEL: But you 're tracing and erasing now . It 's already started . I 'm home in my bed .
STAN: Very good .
MIERZWIAK: We 'll dispose of these mementos when we 're done here . That way you wo n't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home .
STAN: Good . We 're getting healthy read-outs .
STAN'S VOICE: Patrick , do me a favor
PATRICK: The voltage looks fine .
STAN: Then check the connections . Patrick fiddles with some jacks .
PATRICK: Does that help ?
STAN: Yeah , that looks better . Thanks .
MIERZWIAK: Ah , your journal . This will be invaluable .
STAN: December 15th , 2004 . I met someone tonight . Oh , Christ I do n't know what to do . Her name is Clementine and she 's amazing . So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive . Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long .
STAN'S VOICE: I think we got this one . Let 's push on . Joel looks up at the ceiling .
MARY: May I help you ?
JOEL: My name is Joel Barish . I have an appointment .
MARY: Please have a seat . Dr. Mierzwiak will e right with you .
JOEL: Not great .
MARY: Here we are .
MIERZWIAK: I 'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards . You never should have .
JOEL: Well I did .
MIERZWIAK: We can help you through this . Why do n't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine .
JOEL: It was a mess . I do n't know how it got this way
PATRICK'S VOICE: It 's kind of a dump , do n't you think ? Joel looks up , trying to locate the voice .
STAN: It 's an apartment .
PATRICK: Not a dump , then , but kind of plain . Uninspired . And there 's a stale smell . Sort of stuffy . I do n't know . Stuffy .
STAN: Patrick , let 's just get through this . We have a long night ahead of us .
PATRICK: Yeah .
MIERZWIAK: So we 'll need you to go home and bring in everything you ever received from Clementine and anything that might remind you of her
JOEL: So then she just stops calling .
CARMEN: Nothing , Joel .
JOEL: Sorry , Carmen . Any messages ?
RECORDED VOICE: The number you have dialed has been disconnected . Joel 's eyes bug .
JOEL: Why would she do that ?
CARRIE: I do n't know , honey . It 's horrible .
JOEL: She 's punishing me for being honest . I should just go to her house .
ROB: I do n't think you should go there , Joel .
JOEL: Yeah , I do n't want to seem desperate .
CARRIE: Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on . Just make a clean break .
JOEL: I do n't know . I 'm so I ca n't believe she 'd be so goddamn immature !
ROB: Joel , look , the thing is
CARRIE: Joel , honey We have to feed the dog . Would you just wait here ? Just a second .
JOEL: They ca n't erase memories . It 's a joke . It 's a nasty Clementine hoax .
CARRIE: Sweetie , we called the company . Joel just stands there . Close-up of a vague dictionary page .
CARRIE'S VOICE: You ca n't tell her , Joel . They explained that . Like waking a sleepwalker . It might have a devastating effect .
JOEL'S VOICE: But what am I supposed to do ?
CARRIE'S VOICE: Move on , sweetie .
JOEL'S VOICE: How can I ? How can I move on when I know I 'm the only one to carry this love we had ? How do I do that ?
MARY: Hi , May I help you ?
STAN'S VOICE: So , Mary 's coming over tonight . Joel looks up .
PATRICK: Yeah ?
STAN: Just wanted to let you know .
PATRICK: I like Mary . I like when she comes to visit . I just do n't think she likes me .
STAN: She likes you okay .
PATRICK: I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over , too . I have a girlfriend now .
STAN: You can if you want .
PATRICK: Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend ?
STAN: This one 's history . Moving on
PATRICK: The thing is my situation is a little weird . My girlfriend situation .
STAN: Patrick , we need to focus . Stan aims the joystick .
CLEMENTINE: Yo ho ho !
JOEL: It 's three .
CLEMENTINE: a little . I was a little tipsy . Do n't call me pathetic .
JOEL: Well it is pathetic . And fucking irresponsible . You could 've killed somebody .
CLEMENTINE: Oh Christ I did n't kill anybody . It 's just a fucking dent . You 're like some old lady or something .
JOEL: No , see , Clem , I assume you fucked someone tonight . Is n't that how you get people to like you ?
CLEMENTINE: Fuck you , Joel . Faggot .
JOEL: Look at it out here . It 's falling apart . I 'm erasing you . And I 'm happy . She keeps clomping .
PATRICK'S VOICE: See , remember that girl ? The one we did last week ? The one with the potatoes ? Joel looks up , startled .
STAN'S VOICE: Yeah , that 's this guy 's girlfriend . Was .
PATRICK: I got ta tell you something . I kind of fell in love with her last night .
STAN: She was unconscious , Patrick .
PATRICK: She was beautiful . So sweet and funky and voluptuous . I kind of stole a pai of her panties , is what .
STAN: Jesus , Patrick !
PATRICK'S VOICE: I know . It 's not like I mean , they were clean and all .
STAN'S VOICE: Look , just do n't tell me this stuff . I do n't want to know this shit .
PATRICK'S VOICE: Yeah , okay .
STAN'S VOICE: We have work to do . There 's a click and Joel finds himself in
PATRICK'S VOICE: Okay , but there 's more . Joel listens .
STAN'S VOICE: Patrick do you know how unethical
JOEL: That must be the guy I saw you with .
CLEMENTINE: How can you watch this crap ?
JOEL: Where are you going ?
CLEMENTINE: I 'm fucking crawling out of my skin .
JOEL: Oh shit . I remember this . Want to go ?
CLEMENTINE: I want to have a baby .
JOEL: Let 's talk about it later .
CLEMENTINE: No . I want to have a baby . I have to have a baby .
JOEL: I do n't think we 're ready .
CLEMENTINE: You 're not ready .
JOEL: Clementine , do you really think you could take care of a kid ? She turns violently toward him , glaring .
CLEMENTINE: What ? !
JOEL: I do n't want to talk about this here .
CLEMENTINE: Joel , We 're fucking gon na talk about it ! Joel looks around . People are watching .
JOEL: Clem , I 'm sorry . I should n't have
CLEMENTINE: I 'd make a fucking good mother ! I love children ! I 'm creative and smart and I 'd make a fucking good mother !
JOEL: Oh , thank God . It 's going .
CLEMENTINE: It 's you ! It 's you who ca n't commit to anything ! You have no idea how lucky you are I 'm interested in you ! I do n't even know why I am ! I should just end it ight here , Joel . Leave you in the zoo . Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with !
JOEL: It 's going , Clementine . All the crap and hurt and disappointment . It 's all being wiped away . She looks up at him .
CLEMENTINE: I 'm glad .
JOEL: Me , too .
CLEMENTINE: Would you get me another , Joely ?
MARK: I did n't know she was with someone , man .
CLEMENTINE: S'okay , Mark . Joel does n't like my oobs . I do n't think he likes girls . The bar gets quiet and vague .
JOEL: You 're drunk .
CLEMENTINE: You 're a whiz kid . So perceptive , so
MARY: Oh , hey , Patrick .
PATRICK: Hi , Mary . How 's it going ? She walks past him .
STAN: Hey , you .
MARY: It 's freezing out .
STAN: You found us okay ?
MARY: Yeah . Poor guy . Have anything to drink ?
STAN: We have n't checked .
MARY: Well , allow me to do the honors . It 's fucking freezing and I need something .
PATRICK: Mary hates me . I 've never been popula with the ladies .
STAN: Maybe if you stopped stealing thei panties .
PATRICK: Okay , There 's more , Stan
MARY: Hey , hey . She pours the whiskey .
PATRICK: Nah , I do n't know .
MARY: Blessed are the forgetful , for they get the better even of their blunders . Mary and Stan click glasses .
STAN: That 's a good one .
MARY: Yeah , I ca n't wait to tell Howard ! It seems really appropriate .
STAN: It 's a good one all right .
PATRICK: What 's your bartlett 's ?
STAN: It 's a quote book .
MARY: I love quotes . So did Winston Churchill . He actually has a quotation in Bartlett 's about Bartlett 's . Is n't that trippy ?
PATRICK: Yeah . Cool .
MARY: `` The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts . ''
PATRICK: Very cool . Trippy .
MARY: I like to read what smart people say . So many beautiful , important things .
STAN: Yup .
MARY: Do n't you think Howard 's like that ? Smart ? Important ?
STAN: Yup .
PATRICK: Definitely !
MARY: I think he 'll be in Bartlett 's one day .
PATRICK: Definitely .
CLEMENTINE: You do n't tell me things , Joel . I 'm an open book . I tell you everything . Every damn embarrassing thing . You do n't trust me .
JOEL: No , it is n't that .
CLEMENTINE: I want to know you .
JOEL: I just do n't have anything very interesting about my life .
CLEMENTINE: Joel , you 're a liar .
JOEL: How 's the chicken ?
CLEMENTINE: Good .
JOEL: No . Thanks . There 's a silence .
CLEMENTINE: How 's the fish ? The scene is fading .
JOEL: It 's good .
PATRICK'S VOICE: Hi , Clementine ! Why , what 's wrong ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Well , I 'm not sure , I kind of have to study for my test
PATRICK: Hold on . Let me ask my friend . Stan , can I leave for a little while ? My girlfriend is very
STAN: Patrick , we 're in the middle of
PATRICK: She 's right in the neighborhood . She 's upset .
MARY: Let him go , Stan . I can help .
STAN: Go .
PATRICK: Mary hates me . I 'll be right over , Tangerine .
CLEMENTINE: Joely
JOEL: Yeah , Tangerine ?
CLEMENTINE: Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit ?
JOEL: No .
CLEMENTINE: It 's my favorite book . Since I was a kid . It 's about these toys . There 's this part where the skin Horse tells the abbit what it means to be real . I ca n't believe I 'm crying already . He says , `` It takes a long time . That 's why it does n't often happen to people who eak easily or have sharp edges , or who have to be carefully kept . Generally by the time you are Real , most of your hai has been loved off , and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby . But these things do n't matter at all , because once you are Real you ca n't be ugly , except to people who do n't understand . ''
JOEL: No ! Jesus , No !
MARY: It 's amazing , is n't it ? Such a gift Howard gave the world .
STAN: Yeah .
MARY: To let people begin again . It 's eautiful . You look at a baby and it 's so fresh , so clean , so free . And adults they 're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness hopelessness . And Howard just makes it go away .
STAN: You love him , do n't you ?
MARY: No . Besides , Howard 's married , Stan . He 's a very serious and ethical man . I 'm not going to tempt him to betray all he elieves in .
PATRICK: Oh , baby , what 's going on ?
CLEMENTINE: I do n't know . I 'm lost . I 'm scared . I feel like I 'm disappearing . I 'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me .
PATRICK: Oh , Tangerine .
CLEMENTINE: Nothing makes any sense . Nothing makes any sense .
PATRICK: Sure . We 'll go next weekend and
CLEMENTINE: Now . Now ! I have to go now . I have to see the frozen Charles ! Now ! Tonight !
PATRICK: Um , okay . I 'll call my study partner .
CLEMENTINE: Yay ! It 'll be great ! I 'll get my shit .
JOEL'S VOICE: Hi , it 's Joel . Please leave a message after the beep . Beep .
PATRICK: Stan , it 's Patrick . Pick up .
STAN'S VOICE: Hey , where are you ?
PATRICK: I got into a situation with the old lady . Can you handle things tonight alone ? I 'm eally sorry , man .
STAN: I can handle it . He 's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway .
PATRICK: Thanks , Stan . I owe you .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: I took Joel to walk on Charles River with me last night . It was so beautiful and charming . Joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice , but he wanted to please me so much he 's so sweet that he came out after me . We lay down ight in the center and watched the stars . He took my hand and said `` I could
JOEL: die right now , Clem . I 'm just happy . I 've never felt that before . I 'm just exactly where I want to be .
MIERZWIAK: We can help you through this . Why do n't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about
JOEL: You have to stop this !
MIERZWIAK: What ? What do you mean ?
JOEL: I 'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased ! Stop it now !
MIERZWIAK: Yes , but I 'm just something you 're imagining . What can I do ? I 'm in you head , too .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: and we made love right on the ice . It was absolutely freezing on my ass ! It was wonderful .
CLEMENTINE: I 'm so excited . Yay !
PATRICK: I 'm excited , too . Oh , and I wanted to give you this . It 's a little thing .
CLEMENTINE: It 's gorgeous . Just my taste . I 've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked . Thanks . So let 's get going . Long drive .
JOEL: Yes indeed . Fuck ! They 're erasing you , Clem !
CLEMENTINE: Oh ?
JOEL: I hired them to . We 're in my brain . But I want it to stop , before I wake up and do n't know you anymore .
CLEMENTINE: Wow . Um , well ca n't you just force yourself awake ?
JOEL: I do n't know . He concentrates . Nothing happens .
CLEMENTINE: What if you hide me ?
JOEL: What do you mean ?
CLEMENTINE: Well if they 're looking for me in memories I 'm in , what if you take me to a memory I 'm not in ? And we can hide there till morning .
JOEL: Where ? Where ? Where ?
CLEMENTINE: Jesus . What 's this ?
JOEL: I must be about two . I want my mommy . She 's busy . She 's not looking at me . Look , my Huckleberry Hound doll ! I told you about this ! I want my mommy !
CLEMENTINE: I 'm right here .
JOEL: I 'm scared . I want my mommy . I do n't want to lose you . I do n't want to lose
CLEMENTINE: Joel , Joely , look it 's not fading . The memory . I think we 're hidden .
STAN: It 's stopped .
MARY: What ?
STAN: Listen , it 's not erasing .
MARY: Where ?
STAN: I do n't know . He 's not on the map .
MARY: Well , what should we do ?
STAN: I do n't know ! I just said that !
MARY: Sor-ry We have to do something . He ca n't wake up half done .
STAN: Shit !
MARY: We should call Howard .
STAN: No way . I can handle this .
MARY: This guy 's only half cooked . There 's no time to fuck around , Stan .
STAN: Okay . He dials the phone , waits .
MIERZWIAK: Stan ? What 's going on ?
STAN'S VOICE: The guy we 're doing ? He 's disappeared from the map . I ca n't find him anywhere .
MIERZWIAK: Okay , what happened right before he disappeared ?
STAN'S VOICE: I was away from the monitor for a second . I had it on automatic . I had to go pee .
MIERZWIAK: Well , where was Patrick ?
STAN'S VOICE: He went home sick .
MIERZWIAK: Jesus . All right , what 's the address .
STAN'S VOICE: 1062 Sherman Drive . Apartment 1E , Rockville Center .
MARY: He 's coming ?
STAN: You better go .
MARY: Hell no . She starts getting dressed .
MOTHER: How 's my baby boy ? She 's gone .
JOEL: I really want her to pick me up . It 's weird how strong that desire is .
CLEMENTINE: You know , we 're okay . They 're not finding us . You 'll remember me in the morning . And you 'll come to me and tell me about us and we 'll start over .
JOEL: I loved you so much this day . On my bed in your panties . I remember I thought , how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties . She kisses him .
CLEMENTINE: You remember what happened next ?
JOEL: I came over to the bed and you smelled so good , like you just woke up , slightly sweaty . And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like
CLEMENTINE: another rainy day . Whatever shall we do ?
JOEL: There 's this guy !
CLEMENTINE: What ?
JOEL: There 's this guy . I heard him talking in my apartment . He 's one of the erase guys . And he fell for you when they were erasing you , so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you 're dating him .
CLEMENTINE: Really ? Is he cute ?
JOEL: He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased !
CLEMENTINE: Gross ! You must remember to tell me this in the morning . I 'm , like , so freaked out now .
PATRICK: Nothing is wrong with you . You 're the most wonderful person I 've ever met .
MARY: There he is . Oh my God . Oh my God . Do I look okay ? She does n't say anything .
MIERZWIAK: Mary . What are you doing here ?
STAN: She came to help , Howard .
MARY: I wanted to learn as much about the procedure as possible , Howard . I think it 's important for my jobto help comfort the clientele . You know .
MIERZWIAK: Let 's get to the bottom of this . Shall we ?
STAN: I tried that already .
MIERZWIAK: Did you try going through C-Gate ?
STAN: Yeah . Of course .
MIERZWIAK: I 'm going to do a Spectrum search throughout his memory , see if anything comes up .
MOTHER: Little baby getting awwwl cleean . Awl clean .
JOEL: I love getting bathed in the sink . It 's such a feeling of security .
CLEMENTINE: I 've never seen you happier .
MIERZWIAK: Okay , we 're back in .
MARY: That was beautiful to watch , Howard . Like a surgeon or a concert pianist .
MIERZWIAK: Well , thank you , Mary .
STAN: You get some sleep , Howard . I 'll take it from here .
MIERZWIAK: Yeah , probably a good idea .
CLEMENTINE: But ca n't you see I love you , Antoine .
JOEL: Do n't call me Antoine . My name is Wally .
CLEMENTINE: Yes , but I ca n't love a man named Wally .
JOEL: They found us before . The plan did n't work . I do n't know what to do now .
CLEMENTINE: Hide me somewhere deeper ? Somewhere uried ?
STAN: Howard , they 've disappeared again .
MIERZWIAK: Oh dear .
MARY: I 'm so sorry , Howard , you must be tired .
CLEMENTINE: Look at you , cutey ! What are we doing ?
JOEL: This kid , Joe Early , is going to beat the shit out of me .
JOE EARLY: Hi , Jill .
JOEL: He calls me Jill . Everyone calls me Jill after this . The other kids laughs .
JOE EARLY: I do n't think so . We 're fighting .
JOEL: I do n't want to fight you .
JOE EARLY: C'mon , Jill . Get up , faggot . C'mon .
JOEL: I 'm too scared to even throw a punch . When I tell people this story I leave that part out .
MIERZWIAK: We got him back . Stan , I think I 'm just going to have to get through this manually . We 're running late .
CLEMENTINE: Our house ! Our house !
JOEL: Clem , c'mon , we 've got to hide you . Remember ? He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in
CLEMENTINE: Joel !
JOEL: I do n't like it either , but I 'm just trying to find horrible secret place to Joel 's mother pops her head in the door .
MOTHER: Joel , I was just Oh . Um I 'll ask you in the morning , honey . Have a good night .
JOEL: Happy Birthday .
CLEMENTINE: Thanks , Joely . A present ! Oh boy !
JOEL: I scoured the city for it .
CLEMENTINE: I love it !
BOYS: C'mon , Joel , you have to . Do it already . Joel does n't want to . Clementine watches .
JOEL: I ca n't . I have to go home . I 'll do it later .
CLEMENTINE: It 's okay . You were a little kid . This is a great birthday present . Getting to see you as a boy . She kisses him and they walk holding hands .
JOEL: That 's where I live . Lived .
MIERZWIAK: I 'm getting the hang of it . I still understand it . But I 'm finding him quickly enough . I 'm hopeful there wo n't e too much peripheral eradication . Mary sits on the bed .
MARY: I like watching you work . Stan sighs , grabs his coat .
STAN: I 'll go out for a smoke . If no one minds .
MIERZWIAK: That 's fine , Stan .
MARY: Do you like quotes , Howard ?
MIERZWIAK: How do you mean ?
MARY: Oh , um , like famous quotes . I find eading them inspirational to me . And in my reading I 've come across some I thought you might like , too .
MIERZWIAK: Oh . Well , I 'd love to hear some .
MARY: Okay , um , there 's one that goes `` Blessed are the forgetful , for they get the etter even of their blunders . ''
MIERZWIAK: Is that Nietzsche ?
MARY: Yeah , yeah it is , Howard . And here I was thinking I could tell you something you did n't know .
MIERZWIAK: It 's a good quote , Mary . I 'm glad we oth know it .
MARY: There 's another one I like , I read . It 's y Pope Alexander .
MIERZWIAK: Alexander Pope ?
MARY: Yes , shit . Oops , sorry ! Sorry . It 's just I told myself I was n't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it . Like I psyched myself out .
MIERZWIAK: It 's no big deal .
MARY: You are such a sweetheart .
MIERZWIAK: That 's lovely .
MARY: Really ? I thought it was appropriate maybe . That 's all . I really admire the work that you do . I know it 's not proper to be so familia ut I guess since we 're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to
MIERZWIAK: It 's fine , Mary . I 'm happy to hear it .
MARY: Okay . Good . Great . Thanks . I like you , Howard an awful lot . Is that terrible ?
MIERZWIAK: You 're a wonderful girl , Mary .
MARY: I 've loved you for a very long time . I 'm sorry ! I should n't have said that .
MIERZWIAK: I 've got a wife , Mary . Kids . You know that .
MARY: I wish I was your wife . I wish I had your kids .
MIERZWIAK: We ca n't do this .
MARY: No you 're right . Once again . You 're a decent man , Howard .
MIERZWIAK: I want you to know it 's not because I 'm not interested . If that means anything .
MARY: What ?
MIERZWIAK: Hollis ! Hollis !
MARY: Mrs. Mierzwiak , it 's true . And it 's not Mr. Mierzwiak 's fault . I 'm a stupid little girl with a stupid little crush . I basically forced him into it . I swear .
HOLLIS: Do n't be a monster , Howard . Tell the girl .
MARY: Tell me what ?
HOLLIS: Poor kid . You can have him . You did .
MARY: What , Howard ?
MIERZWIAK: We have a history . I 'm sorry . You wanted the procedure . You wanted it done to get past . I have to finish in there . It 's almost morning . We 'll talk later .
STAN: Let me take you home .
PATRICK: I could die right now , Clem . I 'm just happy . I 've never felt that before . I 'm just exactly where I want to be .
CLEMENTINE: I want to go home .
FATHER: Do n't be like me , son . Do n't waste you life . You 'll come to a point someday where it 'll be too late . You 'll be sewn into your fate
JOEL: It was horrifying , seeing my father like that . There was no hope for me if his life was such a failure . And he saw failure in me , too , written in my future .
FATHER: and there 'll be nowhere to go except where you 're headed , like a train on a track . Inevitable , unalterable .
JOEL: I 'm done , Clem . I 'm just going to ride it out . Hiding is clearly not working .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah .
JOEL: I want to enjoy my little time left with you .
CLEMENTINE: This is our first `` date '' date .
JOEL: Do you remember what we talked about ?
CLEMENTINE: Naomi , I guess .
JOEL: Yeah .
CLEMENTINE: What was I wearing ?
JOEL: God , I should know . Your hair was red . I remember it matched the wallpaper .
CLEMENTINE: Egad , were you horrified ?
JOEL: No ! I think you were wearing that black dress , y'know , with the buttons . She is wearing the black dress .
CLEMENTINE: No , you were with me when I bought that . At that place on East 6th . It was later .
JOEL: Right . Something black though .
CLEMENTINE: I 'll buy that . Black 's always good .
JOEL: We did talk about Naomi .
CLEMENTINE: I said Are you sure ? You seem unsure .
JOEL: I 'm sure , I said .
CLEMENTINE: But you were n't . I could tell .
JOEL: I was so nervous . I remember I could n't think of anything to say . There were long silences . There is a long silence .
CLEMENTINE: So what . Infatuation is good , too .
JOEL: And I did n't have an argument .
CLEMENTINE: Come up and see me now .
JOEL: It 's very late .
CLEMENTINE: Yes , exactly . Exactly my point .
JOEL: This was our first time .
MIERZWIAK VOICE: Okay , so just tell me what you remember . And we 'll take it from there .
MARY'S VOICE: Um , I liked you immediately . At the jo interview . You seemed so important and mature . And I loved that you were helping all these people . You did n't come on to me at all . I liked that . I was tongue-tied around you at first . I wanted you to think I was smart . You were so nice . I loved the way you smelled . I could n't wait to come to work . I had these fantasies of us being married and having kids and just and so then when that one day , when I thought you looked at me back like Oh , Howie , I ca n't do this ? How can I do this ?
MIERZWIAK VOICE: It 's what 's best , Mary . You know that .
MARY'S VOICE: Yeah , I know . Oh , God . Okay , well , I was so excited
JOEL: Naomi .
NAOMI: Yours ?
JOEL: You take it . I do n't know . She tosses it in a box .
NAOMI: Do n't do this to me now , Joel . Really .
JOEL: I told her today I need to end it .
CLEMENTINE: Is that what you want ?
JOEL: I did it . I guess that means something . Clementine shrugs . The scene fades .
NAOMI: So what 's going on , Joel ?
JOEL: I do n't know , I 've just been thinking , maybe we 're not happy with each other .
NAOMI: What ?
JOEL: Y'know , we 've been , I do n't know , sort of , unhappy with each other and
NAOMI: Do n't say `` we '' when you mean `` you . ''
JOEL: I think maybe , we 're both so used to operating at this level that How can one person be unhappy ? If one person is unhappy , both have to be by definition .
NAOMI: Bullshit . Who is it ? You met someone .
JOEL: No . I just need some space , maybe .
NAOMI: The thing is , Joel , whatever it is you think you have with this chick , once the thrill wears off , you 're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems .
JOEL: It 's not somebody else .
CLEMENTINE: I did n't think you 'd show your face around me again . I figured you were humiliated . You did run away , after all .
JOEL: Sorry to track you down like this . I 'm not a stalker . But I needed to see you .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah ?
JOEL: I 'd like to take you out or something .
CLEMENTINE: Well , you 're married .
JOEL: Not yet . Not married .
CLEMENTINE: Look , man , I 'm telling you right off the at , I 'm high maintenance . So I 'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage o whatever it is you got going there . If you want to be with me , you 're with me .
JOEL: Okay .
CLEMENTINE: So make your domestic decisions and maybe we 'll talk again .
JOEL: I just think that you have some kind of quality that seems really important to me .
CLEMENTINE: Joel , I 'm not a concept . I want you to just keep that in your head . Too many guys think I 'm a concept or I complete them or I 'm going to make them alive , but I 'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind . Do n't assign me yours .
JOEL: I remember that speech really well .
CLEMENTINE: I had you pegged , did n't I ?
JOEL: You had the whole human race pegged .
CLEMENTINE: Probably .
JOEL: I still thought you were going to save me . Even after that .
CLEMENTINE: I know .
JOEL: It would be different , if we could just give it another go around .
CLEMENTINE: Remember me . Try your best . Maybe we can . The scene is gone .
JOEL: Thanks , guys .
CARRIE: I hope you feel better , sweetie .
JOEL: Yeah .
CARRIE: Say hi to Naomi . The car door closes .
NAOMI: Hi .
JOEL: Hi .
NAOMI: How was it ?
JOEL: You did n't miss much . Rob Carrie say hello .
NAOMI: Hi , Rob and Carrie .
JOEL: Go back to sleep . The room is starting to decompose .
NAOMI: Yeah . Come to bed . I 'm cold .
JOEL: In a minute .
NAOMI: I 've got to finish this chapter anyway . The scene is fading .
JOEL: Okay . I wish you could come .
NAOMI: Yeah .
CARRIE: I 'm sorry Naomi could n't make it . You okay ? You seem quiet .
JOEL: Just a little overworked , maybe .
CARRIE: I did . You said , things were fine .
JOEL: I remember .
CARRIE: This is the night you met Clementine , Joel . I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought , oh shit .
JOEL: Yeah , you told me that later .
CARRIE: I told you that later .
JOEL: No one .
CARRIE: Is this the right way ?
JOEL: You were down by the surf . I could just make you out in the dark .
CLEMENTINE: Hi there .
JOEL: Hi .
CLEMENTINE: I saw you sitting over here . By yourself . I thought , thank God , someone normal , who does n't know how interact at these things either .
JOEL: Yeah . I do n't ever know what to say .
CLEMENTINE: I ca n't tell you how happy I am to hea that . I mean , I do n't mean I 'm happy you 're uncomfortable , but , yknow I 'm such a loser . Every time I come to a party I tell myself I 'm going to be different and it 's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after fo eing such a clod .
JOEL: Even then I did n't believe you entirely . I thought how could you be talking to me if you could n't talk to people ?
CLEMENTINE: But , I do n't know , maybe we 're the normal ones , y'know ? I mean , what kind of people do well at this stuff ?
JOEL: You know what I did .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah , I know . I 'm fishing .
JOEL: You said She picks a drumstick off of Joel 's plate .
CLEMENTINE: I 'm Clementine . Can I borrow a piece of your chicken ?
JOEL: And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers .
CLEMENTINE: Oh God , how horrid .
JOEL: I 'm Joel .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah , like that .
JOEL: Nope . No jokes . My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll . I think your name is magic . She smiles .
CLEMENTINE: This is it , Joel . It 's gon na be gone soon .
JOEL: I know .
CLEMENTINE: What do we do ?
JOEL: Enjoy it . Say good-bye . She nods .
CLEMENTINE: No , I stopped . I did n't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated .
JOEL: I know what you mean . That 's why I stopped .
CLEMENTINE: But my sleeping is really fucked up .
JOEL: I do n't think I 've slept in a year .
CLEMENTINE: You should try Xanax . I mean , it 's a chemical and all , but it works and it works just having it around , knowing that it 's there . Like insurance .
JOEL: yeah ?
CLEMENTINE: I 'll give you a couple . See what you think .
JOEL: Okay .
CLEMENTINE: Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova ?
JOEL: I love her .
CLEMENTINE: Really ? Me , too ! I do n't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a ook store .
JOEL: I think she 's great .
CLEMENTINE: Me too . There 's this poem
JOEL: Did this conversation come before o after we saw the house ?
CLEMENTINE: I think , before .
JOEL: Seems too coincidental that way .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah , maybe .
JOEL: Yeah , yeah . It goes `` Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines '' ?
CLEMENTINE: Yes ! I love that poem . It breaks my heart . I 'm so excited you know it . Look , houses in which we do n't live . Joel chuckles appreciatively .
JOEL: Um , no .
CLEMENTINE: Let 's move into this neighborhood .
JOEL: I do sort of live with somebody though .
CLEMENTINE: Oh . She walks to the next house , tries the door .
JOEL: Female .
CLEMENTINE: At least I have n't been barking up the wrong tree .
JOEL: What are you doing ?
CLEMENTINE: It 's freezing out here .
JOEL: Clementine .
CLEMENTINE: I could see you wanted to come in , Joel . He walks cautiously toward the door .
JOEL: I knew .
CLEMENTINE: I knew by your nervousness that Naomi was n't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass .
JOEL: It 's dark .
CLEMENTINE: Yeah . What 's your girlfriend 's name ?
JOEL: Naomi .
CLEMENTINE: Ah-ha ! Now I can look for candles , matches , and the liquor cabinet .
JOEL: I think we should go .
CLEMENTINE: No , it 's our house ! Just tonight we 're David and Ruth Laskin . Which one do you want to be ? I prefer to be Ruth but I 'm flexible . Alcohol ! You make drinks . I 'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth . I 'm ruthless at the moment .
JOEL: I really should go . I really need to catch my ride .
CLEMENTINE: Come back and make up a good-bye at least . Let 's pretend we had one .
JOEL: I love you . She smiles . They kiss . It fades .
CARRIE: Did you have fun ? Joel nods glumly .
HOWARD: Okay .
HOLLIS'S VOICE: Hi , you 've reached the Mierzwiaks . We ca n't come to Howard hangs up .
STAN: So , I 've got to drop the van off .
MIERZWIAK: Thanks , Stan . Thanks .
PATRICK: You want to stop for coffee or something ? Mary shakes her head `` no . '' Long silence .
STAN: Hey .
MARY: Do you swear you did n't know ?
STAN: I swear .
MARY: And you never even suspected ? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together ?
STAN: Once , maybe .
MARY: How did I look ?
STAN: Happy . Happy with a secret . Mary starts to cry .
MARY: And after that ?
STAN: I never saw you together like that again . So I figured I was imagining things . Mary says nothing .
MARY: Do you remember anything else ? What I was wearing ? Was I standing close to him ? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it ? How did he look at me when I giggled ? Tell me everything .
STAN: You were in red . That red sweater with the little flowers , I think . You were leaning against his car . He looked a little like a kid . Kind of goofy and wide-eyed . I 'd never seen him look like that before . Happy . You looked beautiful . You looked in love .
MARY: Thanks , Stan . She stops but does n't turn to face him .
JOEL: Hi Naomi ? Yeah , hi ! How are you ? I know , I know . It 's been a long time . Not too much . You ? Oh , that 's great ! Congratulations ! Maybe I could buy you dinner to celebrate ? Tonight ? I 'm free . Okay , good !
MARY: I need this signed , Howard .
MIERZWIAK: I do n't know what I 'm supposed say , Mary . I want to do the right thing here .
MARY: Do you love me ? Did you love me ? Something . I listened to my tape . I ca n't believe I 've been sitting right in front of it for a year . It 's like listening to someone else 's story . I mean , I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I ca n't even imagine you naked . I ca n't even say `` naked '' to you !
MIERZWIAK: I have a family , Mary .
MARY: You made me have an abortion .
MIERZWIAK: It was a mutual decision .
MARY: You made me have you erased ! I loved you . I love you ! How could you
MIERZWIAK: I did n't make you . You thought it best . But , look , I take full responsibility .
NAOMI: So you have n't been involved with anyone in all this time ?
JOEL: It 's been a pretty lonely couple of years .
NAOMI: I 'm sorry .
JOEL: Well , it was my fault the break-up . I 'm sorry .
NAOMI: Oh , sweetie . It really does cut both ways . We were taking each other fo granted and
JOEL: I miss you .
NAOMI: Miss you , too . I have been seeing someone for a little while .
JOEL: Oh ! Great . That 's great !
NAOMI: A religion instructor at Columbia . A good guy . He 's a good guy .
JOEL: I 'm sorry . I really should n't have
NAOMI: I 'm glad you called .
JOEL: So you think the dissertation will get published ?
NAOMI: I don ; t know . I 'm not sure there 's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny .
CLEMENTINE: So you 'll call me , right ?
JOEL: Yeah .
CLEMENTINE: When ?
JOEL: Tomorrow ?
CLEMENTINE: Tonight . Just to test out the phone lines .
JOEL: Yeah .
NAOMI'S VOICE: Hi .
JOEL: How 's it going ?
NAOMI'S VOICE: Good . I called you at work today . They said you were home sick .
JOEL: I know . I had to take the day to think .
NAOMI'S VOICE: Yeah , I tried you at home . Did you get my message ?
JOEL: I just got in .
NAOMI'S VOICE: Long day thinking . Joel flips on messages with volume down .
JOEL: Yeah , I suppose so .
NAOMI'S VOICE: That 's me .
JOEL: There you are . Naomi , it 's just I 'm afraid if we fall ack into this fast without considering the problems we had
NAOMI: Okay , Joel . I suppose you 're right .
JOEL: I had a good time last night . I really did .
NAOMI: So I 'm going to get some sleep . I 'm glad you 're okay .
JOEL: We 'll speak soon .
NAOMI: 'Night .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: What took you so long ?
JOEL: I just walked in .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Hmmm . Do you miss me ?
JOEL: Oddly enough , I do .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Ha Ha ! You said , I do . I guess that means we 're married .
JOEL: I guess so .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Tomorrow night honeymoon on ice .
CLEMENTINE: Do n't worry . It 's really solid this time of year .
JOEL: I do n't know .
CLEMENTINE: Is n't it ?
JOEL: I do n't know . What if it breaks ?
CLEMENTINE: What if ?
JOEL: I think I should go back .
CLEMENTINE: Joel , come here . Please .
JOEL: Listen , did you want to make love ?
CLEMENTINE: Make love ?
JOEL: Have sex . Y'know
CLEMENTINE: Oh , um
JOEL: Because I just am not drunk enough o stoned enough to make that happen right now .
CLEMENTINE: That 's okay . I
JOEL: I 'm sorry . I just wanted to say that . This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and
CLEMENTINE: Hey , Joel
JOEL: and I 'm just too nervous around you ight now .
CLEMENTINE: I 'm nervous , too .
JOEL: Yeah ? I would n't have thought that .
CLEMENTINE: Well , you obviously do n't know me .
JOEL: I 'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you . She smiles up at the sky .
CLEMENTINE: Show me which constellations you know .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Yeah ?
JOEL: Did you send this ? Is it a joke ?
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: I probably got the same thing as you .
JOEL: I mean , I have n't even told anyone I 've met you . Who would even know to do this ?
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Maybe it 's true then . It 's my voice on the tape .
JOEL: That 's what you have to say ? How could it be true ? I never even heard of any procedure like this . It 's a joke .
CLEMENTINE: Maybe . Call someone who 'd know .
CARRIE: Yes , Joel . It is true . We were n't supposed to say anything . They say it 's like waking a sleepwalker .
JOEL: It 's true .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: I know . I spoke to my friend Magda .
JOEL: Look , I have to go . I have to think .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Joel , we 've fucked . We 've made love . Like a million times . And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each othe last night . Is n't that lovely ?
CLEMENTINE: Says you were closed off , non communicative , never told me what you were feeling .
JOEL: Says you were a bully
CLEMENTINE: A bully ? Moi ?
JOEL: That 's what it says . You drank too much , you picked on me for being passive and timid .
CLEMENTINE: Well , sounds like me . Sorry , man . Says you were jealous and suspicious .
JOEL: Says you would sometimes disappear all night , then brag to me about your sexual conquests .
CLEMENTINE: Did I use the term `` sexual conquests '' o is that your way of putting it .
JOEL: I do n't know .
CLEMENTINE: Does n't sound like me .
JOEL: Says you were a slob , leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake .
CLEMENTINE: Says you were constantly calling me a slob . It 's sexy that we were like a married couple , griping and overly-familiar and ored . Do n't you think ?
JOEL: I sort of do . But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality . Cleaned up enough to be erotic .
CLEMENTINE: We should have sex . It 's old hat for us . She smiles at nervous Joel .
JOEL: You 're so beautiful .
RECEPTIONIST: May I help you ?
STAN: I work here . I used to work here . Stan . Please just tell Howard I 'm here to clean out my desk .
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Mierzwiak , Stan is here to Yes sir . He says he needs to see you .
MIERZWIAK: She should not have done this , Stan . As mad as she was as justifiably
STAN: I do n't know what you 're talking about , Howard .
MIERZWIAK: Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people .
STAN: Jesus .
YOUNG WOMAN: so I called everybody I know and asked them to tell me everything . Now I know my entire history with him , but it 's in the form of a story , I 'm losing my mind .
MIERZWIAK: This is why people must never be told . It 's like waking a
YOUNG WOMAN: I do n't know what to do . Before I thought I was depressed for no reason . Now it 's like I 've been assigned a eason .
PATRICK: This never should 've happened , ma'am . We 'll take care of it .
MIERZWIAK: I know you do n't like me much , Stan , but please talk to Mary . She of all people should know this is a dangerous thing she 's doing .
JOEL: Hi , it 's Joel .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Hey , lover . Whatcha doing ?
JOEL: I 'm just , y'know , passing the time best I can till I can see you .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: God , I ca n't believe I ever hated you .
JOEL: You must have been crazy .
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Guess what I 'm wearing .
JOEL: I do n't know . Panties and
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Your dried cum .
JOEL: Jesus .
CLEMENTINE: You 're still excited by my irreverence . You have n't yet started to think of it as my `` gratuitous need to shock . ''
JOEL: I ca n't stop thinking about you .
CLEMENTINE: Yay . Meet me after work by the old mill .
JOEL: What old mill ? Is that somewhere we
CLEMENTINE: I just wanted to say that . Come by my house .
MARY: Oh .
STAN: Hi .
MARY: What do you want , Stan ?
STAN: Can I I brought some
MARY: Nothing .
STAN: I know what it is .
MARY: Then why did you ask me ?
STAN: I do n't know . I just there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office .
MARY: They have a right to know . Howard is a thief . He steals the truth . I ca n't remember my baby ! I ca n't emember my baby . It existed and I ca n't even remember . Do you understand that ?
STAN: Mary , people come to him voluntarily .
MARY: I wo n't allow it . Those who can not emember the past are condemned to repeat it . What do you think of that ? That 's from my quote book .
STAN: The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased .
MARY: Remember the Alamo ! Remember the Alamo !
STAN: Mary please . This is hurting people . Long pause , then
MARY: I do n't want to hurt people . But these things happened ! All these little sadnesses , the big ones . What if no one remembers ? What does that do to the world ? Someone has to remember , Stan . They look at each other .
MAN: He wo n't bite . You can pet him if you want Shot of the girl petting the dog .
MARY: May I help you ?
DISTRAUGHT WOMAN: I 'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak . My name is Helene Kernfeld .
MARY: Yes , please have a seat . The doctor will e with you momentarily .
MAN: II I find you physically epulsive ! I ca n't even look at you ! They look at each other in silence .
OLD MAN: How are you today , Mary ?
CONT'D: He just stared at me as if I did n't exist . As if I had never existed
THE END: < /pre pre
ANOTHER INDIAN: She dreams of loving .
STILL ANOTHER: She has the blues .
UNCLE: Well , you 're lucky that you do n't suck 'em .
DADDY: Sissy could n't suck 'em , she 'd need a mouth like a fish tank .
UNCLE: The poor little tyke might have a hard time finding herself a hubby . But as far as getting along in the world , it 's a real blessing that Sissy 's a girl-child . Lord , I reckon this youngun would never make a mechanic .
DADDY: Nope , and not a brain surgeon , neither .
UNCLE: Course she 'd do pretty good as a utcher . She could retire in two years on the overcharges alone .
DR. DREYFUS: She is , if I may speak frankly , somewhat of a medical oddity . Due to impaired dexterity , her life activities and career potentialities will be reduced . It could be worse . Bring her back to me if there eve is pain . Meanwhile , she will have to learn to live with them .
MRS. HANKSHAW: That she will . That she will . The Lord made them things big for a purpose . God do n't never git tired of testing our kind . It 's a punishment of some sort , for what I do n't rightly know . Oh Doc , if a young man ever shows up here with , a young man with ugly fingers , you know , something similar , a similar case , Doc , would you please
DR. DREYFUS: Remember the words of the painte Paul Gauguin , dear lady . `` The ugly may be beautiful , the pretty never . '' I do n't suppose that means very much to you .
MRS. HANKSHAW: It 's a judgement . She 's got ta bea the punishment . Sissy beams serenely like a Christ figure .
MADAME ZOE: I am the enlightened Madame Zoe .
SISSY: Sissy .
MADAME ZOE: Hmmm . I 'd say that you have an intelligent , kindly , somewhat artistic nature . However , Sissy , however , there is a heavy quality to the second phalanx- the phalanx of logic that indicates a capacity for foolish or clownish behavior , a refusal to accept responsibility or to take things seriously and bent to be disrespectful of those who do . You mama tells me that you 're pretty well behaved and shy , but I 'd watch out for signs of irrationality . All ight ? She pulls her thumb to her breast .
MRS HANKSHAW: Do n't know ; the doctors do n't know
SISSY: Just lucky I guess .
MADAME ZOE: Do you study history in school ? Galileo , Descartes , Newton ? Lebinitz had very large thumbs ; Voltaire 's were enormous , but , heh heh , just pickles compared with yours .
SISSY: What about Crazy Horse ?
MADAME ZOE: Crazy Horse ? You mean the Indian ? Nobody that I 've ever heard of eve troubled to study the paws of savages . Well , I guess that about covers the three-fifty charge
MRS. HANKSHAW: Husband .
MADAME ZOE: Beg your pardon ?
MRS. HANKSHAW: Husband . Will she find a husband ?
MADAME ZOE: Oh , I see .
DELORES: I 've traveled through the Yucatan with a circus , popping false eyelashes off a trained monkey with a bullwhip . When I ate peyote one night and had a vision . Niwetükame , the Mothe Goddess , came to me on the back of a doe , hummingbirds sipping the tears she was shedding , crying 'Delores , you must lead my daughters against their natural enemy . You must come to the Rubber Rose Ranch and prepare for your mission , the details of which will be revealed to you in a third vision . ' That night I whipped the shit out of my black lover and an away . For a while I drove around , making a living selling peyote buttons to hippies , until I made my way here
SISSY: Going north ?
MAN: You bet your raggedy white ass I am . Sissy gets in .
SISSY: American Cheese . The king of road food .
MAN: Are you in show business ?
SISSY: I was a successful model once .
MAN: For magazines ?
SISSY: I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970 , but got laid off .
MAN: So now you 're bummin ' around ?
SISSY: Yep .
MAN: Hitchhiking ?
SISSY: I 'm the best .
MAN: You 're the best ?
SISSY: When I was younger , I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping , without food or sleep , crossed the continent twice in six days , cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways .
MAN: Whooee !
SISSY: As I developed , however , I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style . Time in terms of M.P.H . no longer interested me . I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow , ancient , vast . When I am really moving , stopping car after car after car , moving so freely , so clearly , so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass , then I embody the rhythms of the universe . I am in a state of grace .
THE COUNTESS: I will send this out to Sissy , she should get it in a week , and you will be able to meet her . When I send a letter to Sissy , duplicates must be sent to U.S. Post Office Boxes in LaConner , Taos , Pine Ridge , Cherokee and that other place , fo her to pick up Why she 's probably out there right now in Hibbing , Minnesota , or Deluth , Montana hitching her way across the country .
SISSY: Right off , I do n't remember how old I was when I found out I was part Indian . My mamma 's family , a lot of them , had lived out West , in the Dakotas , and one of them had married a squaw . Siwash tribe . My pleasure in Indianhood and my passion for ca travel might be incongruous if not mutually exclusive.. Afte all , the first car that ever stopped for me had been named in honor of the great chief of the Ottawa Pontiac
THE COUNTESS: Sit down dear , do sit down .
SISSY: Tired
THE COUNTESS: That 's the very first time in the eons that I 've known you that I 've ever heard you complain . And now you 're tired , poor darling .
SISSY: A born freak can only go uphill .
THE COUNTESS: Freak , schmeek . Most of us are freaks in one way or another . Try being orn a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you 'll see what I mean .
SISSY: I 've always been proud of the way nature singled me out . It 's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for . I 've been steady moving for eleven years and some months . Maybe I should rest up for a spell , I 'm not as young as I used to e .
THE COUNTESS: Shit O goodness , you wo n't be thirty for another year , and you 're more eautiful than ever .
SISSY: Does that mean you might have an assignment for me ?
THE COUNTESS: You were the Yoni Yum girl from , let 's see , from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy . You 've always smelled so nice . Like a little sister . The irony has just killed me . You , the Dew Girl , one of the few girls who does n't need Dew . I loath the stink of females ! They are so sweet the way God made them , then they start fooling around with men and soon they 're stinking . Like rotten mushrooms , like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool , like a tuna fish 's retirement party . They all stink . From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean , they stink .
SISSY: Bonanza Jellybean ?
THE COUNTESS: What ? Oh yes . Tee-hee . Jellybean .
SISSY: Your ranch ?
THE COUNTESS: Oh my dear yes , I bought a little anch out West , sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products , Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder . A tax write-off , actually .
SISSY: A job for me ?
THE COUNTESS: I am once more about to make advertising history . And only you , the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl , could possibly assist me .
SISSY: The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as listers , burns and rashes . Although the FDA judges that the reported eactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market , they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings .
THE COUNTESS: Shit O dear , that 's enough to make me asthmatic . The nerve of those twits . What do they know about female odor ? Do n't interrupt . Here 's my concept . My ranch out West ? It 's a eauty ranch . Oh , it 's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes . But it 's a beauty ranch , a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows , mainly can go to lose weight , remove wrinkles , change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment . My ranch is named the Rubber Rose , after the Rubbe Rose douche bag , my own invention , and bless its little red bladder , the most popular douche bag in the world . So get this . It 's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes . The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence . Well , these cranes stop off at my little pond Siwash Lake , it 's called twice a year , autumn and spring , and spend a few days each time , resting up , eating , doing whatever whooping cranes do . I 've never seen them , understand , but I hear they 're magnificent . Very big specimens I mean , huge mothers and white as snow , to coin a phrase , except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers , and bright red heads . Now , whooping cranes , in case you did n't know it , are noted fo their mating dance . It 's just the wildest show in nature . It 's probably the reason why irdwatching used to be so popula with old maids and deacons . Picture these rare , beautiful , gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud , arching their backs , flapping their wings , strutting low to the ground . Dears , it 's overwhelming . And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV . Right there on the home screen , creation 's most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope . With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground . In a white gown , red hood attached , and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black . In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane , she dance/walks ove to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum . And a can of Dew . Off-camera , a string quartet is playing Debussy . A sensuous voice is eading a few poetic lines about courtship and love . Are you starting to get it ? Does n't it make the hai on your neck stand up and applaud ? My very goodness gracious ! Grandiose , lyrical , erotic and Girl Scout- oriented ; you ca n't top it . I 've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios , the best wildlife cinematographers around . You 're my eternal favorite . Princess Grace herself could n't be better , not even if she had your personality which she does n't ; Anyway , dear , I 'm out of photography now and into wate colors . Ah how circuitous conversation is ! We 're back at the beginning . The exact man I 've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist . Sissy dares a sip of Red Ripple .
SISSY: If you do n't want me to pose fo him , why do you want me to meet him ?
THE COUNTESS: Purely personal . I believe you might enjoy one another .
SISSY: But Countess
THE COUNTESS: Now , now . Do n't get exasperated . I ealize that you 've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men , and I might add , you 've been wise . Heterosexual elationships seem to lead only to marriage . For men , marriage is a matter of efficient logistics The male gets his food , bed , laundry , TV , pussy , offspring and creature comforts all under one roof , where he does n't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much , then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life , which is what existence is all about . But for a woman marriage is surrender .
SISSY: Why , yes , technically . Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close , but he was afraid of me , I think
THE COUNTESS: Yes , well , what I 'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity . She ca n't wait too long , you know . Now , there 's no reason why you must lose yours . I mean , just ponder it a bit , that 's all .
SISSY: What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a omantic relationship ?
THE COUNTESS: I ca n't be certain that you would . But what have you got to lose ?
SISSY: Well , okay . I 'll try it . I do n't see the point in it , but I 'll try it . Just for you . It 's kind of silly , actually , me going out with an artist in New York City . However
THE COUNTESS: Good , good , good you 'll enjoy it , you 'll see . Julian is a gentleman .
JELLY: Well , I 'm not scared of a little ain .
DELORES: Me neither .
JELLY: Might as well brave it .
DELORES: Right . I do n't know about you but I 'm sure not sweet enough to melt .
JELLY: Someday if that Sissy Hankshaw ever shows up here , I 'm gon na teach her how to hypnotize a chicken . Chickens are the easiest critters on Earth to hypnotize . If you can look a chicken in the eyes for tens seconds , it 's yours forever .
MARY: I want to complain that some of the cowgirls have been sleeping two to a unk again , in violation of the agreement that `` crimes against nature '' are to be confined to the hayloft .
DEBBIE: I do n't care who lay with whom o where or how , but the moaners , groaners and screamers ought to turn down their volume when others are trying to sleep or meditate . Some of the younger cowgirls blush .
BIG RED: I want to complain about the food around here ! It 's rotten to the core .
DELORES: My sacred crocodile ! She 's flipped .
ELAINE: I move that the meeting be adjourned .
DEBBIE: At the end of the endless game , there is friendship .
HEATHER: What the heck did she mean by that !
JELLY: Just that in Heaven all business is conducted this way .
RUPERT: We 'd better take you home .
JULIAN: I beg your pardon . I 've been enthralled with your photographs fo years . When the Countess hinted that you might like to meet me he neve explained why I was ready to paint for him free of charge . And now I had to go and spoil it .
MARIE: This is dreadful . You know , asthma attacks are brought on by emotional stress . Poor Julian is so high strung . The excitement of meeting you my dear , you look so stunning ! must have upset his chemical balance . Carla nods . Everyone is piling into the taxi .
RUPERT: Come on , Sissy , do n't be afraid of us .
SISSY: I 've never ridden in a cab . The whole idea of paying for a ride makes my thumbs hurt .
CARLA: It 'll be all right , dear . It is n't as serious as it sounds .
RUPERT: There , that ought to beat them onchial buggers into submission . He turns to Sissy .
CARLA: Too bad you do n't have a pill fo ullshit .
HOWARD: Where do you live , Miss Hankshaw ?
SISSY: I 'm staying with the Countess .
HOWARD: I know , but where do you reside when you are n't visiting New York ?
SISSY: I do n't .
HOWARD: You do n't ?
SISSY: Well , no , I do n't reside anywhere in particular . I just keep moving .
HOWARD: A traveler , eh ?
SISSY: You might say that , although I do n't think of it as traveling .
CARLA: How do you think of it ?
SISSY: As moving .
CARLA: Oh .
MARIE: How unusual
HOWARD: Mmmmm
CARLA: Rupert , before you get too engrossed in your research on Scotch as a cure for aging , do n't you think you 'd etter phone Elaine 's and cancel ou dinner reservations ?
SISSY: No Indian blankets no Indian lankets
HOWARD: Oh , Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home .
MARIE: Julian fell asleep on the couch ; we covered him up .
HOWARD: We thought that we should make you comfortable too .
SISSY: Yes , thanks
MARIE: Mine are fuller but yours are more perfectly shaped .
HOWARD: Highly debatable . I 'll wager they 're the exact same size .
MARIE: Howard ! Watch your manners . You 've made her blush . Here , Sissy , let me compare .
SISSY: This place is finer than the place I live !
JULIAN: Oh , Sissy . I am sorry about all the fuss .
SISSY: I 'm cold .
JULIAN: Here . I 'll turn down the ai conditioner .
SISSY: It 's not the air conditioner that 's making me cold . Nothing moves in here . Not even your birds . Sissy gets out of bed and begins to dress .
JULIAN: What are you doing ?
SISSY: Getting dressed . I 've got to go .
JULIAN: But I do n't want you to leave . Please stay . We can go to dinner . I owe you a dinner . And tonight we can eally make love .
SISSY: I have to go , Julian .
JULIAN: Why ? Why do you have to go ?
SISSY: My thumbs hurt . I 've made a mistake . I 've been negligent . I have n't exercised . I have to hitchhike a little bit every day , no matter what . It 's like a musician practicing his scales . When I do n't practice , my timing gets off , my thumbs get stiff and sore .
THE COUNTESS: So she left town . Well , that should n't surprise you . Leaving town is what Sissy is all about . But tell me , how did she strike you ? Julian is on the other end of the phone .
JULIAN: Extraordinary !
THE COUNTESS: She 's obviously that . Jesus ! Which would you rather have , a million dollars or one of Sissy 's thumbs full of pennies ?
JULIAN: Oh , you ! I 'm not talking about he hands . They 're difficult to ignore , I confess , but I 'm speaking of he whole being . Her whole being is extraordinary . The way she talks , for example . She 's so articulate .
THE COUNTESS: It 's high time you realized , honey abe , that a woman does n't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language .
JULIAN: Countess . I 'm really in a dither . She 's turned my head .
THE COUNTESS: Ninety degrees to the left , I hope . How does she feel about you ?
JULIAN: I think she 's disappointed that I 'm not more , ah , sort of atavistic . She 's got some naive , sentimental notions about Indians . I 'm sure she liked me , though ; but . then she left town .
THE COUNTESS: She always leaves town , you dummy . That does n't mean anything . What about in bed ? How does she like it in bed ? Julian pauses for a very long moment .
JULIAN: How does she like what in bed ?
THE COUNTESS: Like what ? The Countess ' teeth chatter in his mouth .
JULIAN: Well . er
THE COUNTESS: Shit O dear , Julian . Do you mean to tell me you did n't get it on ?
JULIAN: Oh , we did n't get it all the way on .
THE COUNTESS: Whose fault was that ?
JULIAN: I suppose it was mine . Yes , it definitely was my fault .
THE COUNTESS: What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools , anyway ? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you ? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck . Why , send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he 'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy . Jesus H.M.S . Christ ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they 'd turn him into a candidate fo the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps . Oogie boogie .
JULIAN: If we Ivy Leaguers are n't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies , at least we do n't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink . ' Next thing I know , you 'll be calling me 'chief . '
THE COUNTESS: Chink 's the guy 's name , for Christ 's sake .
JULIAN: What guy ?
THE COUNTESS: Aw , he 's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West . Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies , too . But though he be old and dirty , he 's alive , I 'll bet , clear down to his toes . They do n't have his juice in a jar in New Haven . Well I suppose that I 'll have to write Sissy out on the road .
WOMAN: Are you a pilgrim ?
SISSY: No , I 'm more of an Indian The trio does n't smile .
DRIVER: She means are you going to see the Chink ?
SISSY: Oh , I may and I may not . But seeing him is not my main objective out here .
DRIVER: That 's good . Because he wo n't see you . We came all the way from Minneapolis to see him and the crazy astard tried to stone us to death
OTHER MAN: Yeah , but I no longer believe that guy 's a master . He 's just a dirty , uptight old mountain man . Why , he pulled out his pecker and shook it at Barbara . I 'd stay away from there if I were you , lady .
MISS ADRIAN: By any chance are you Sissy Hankshaw ?
SISSY: Yes I am .
MISS ADRIAN: My goodness . Why did n't you telephone ? Someone would have driven into Mottburg to pick you up . I 'm Miss Adrian . From the ranch . The Countess wrote that I should expect you . Get in , wo n't you ? You must be exhausted . Gloria , assist Miss Hankshaw with her luggage .
COWGIRL: Cool ! We 're going to make a movie !
BIG RED: Get rid of the furniture . it 's too masculine Get rid of all the furniture and use it for kindling ! ! ! Break away from these pig-like chauvinist masculine influences .
MISS ADRIAN: O merciful Jesus ! They 're murdering the guests !
MAN: Take it easy , lady . They went on a short ride with the cowgirls . Rode over the hill yonder . You 're Miss Adrian , are n't you ? We need to talk to you about the filming .
MISS ADRIAN: Not now , you fool , not now . Those crazed bitches have led innocent women out and are slaughtering them at this moment . We 'll all be killed . Oh ! Ohhh !
CAMERAMAN: There 's a slaughter going on all ight , but it 's not the fat ladies that are getting it . Your hired hands are killing the cattle .
MISS ADRIAN: The cattle ? They 're killing the cows ? All of them ?
CAMERAMAN: That 's what they said , Miss Adrian .
MISS ADRIAN: How dare you slaughter the Countess 's cattle ! What is a ranch without cows ?
COWGIRL: We 're going to replace them with goats . Most of the cattle are diseased and in pain . We 're just putting them out of their misery . According to Bon-an-za Jellybean , the Rubber Rose is in-di-cat-ive of the Countess 's values . He has purchased a cheap weak strain of cow to begin with and with improper care .
MISS ADRIAN: Oh heavens ! I do n't want to hea what Bonanza Jellybean has been telling you girls . Come on Sissy . I 'll show you to your quarters .
MAID: Excuse me , Miss . Do you care fo your breakfast now ? Sissy sits up and rubs her eyes .
SISSY: Yeah . I feel a bit hungry .
MAID: Well it is a change of our usual grapefruit and melba toast , I 'm sure . Sissy notices a card . It reads Compliments of Bonanza Jellybean
SISSY: Bonanza Jellybean .
MAID: She will be up to see you directly .
JELLY: Welcome , podner . By God , it 's great to have you here . It 's an honor . Sorry I took so long getting to you , ut we 've had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to do .
SISSY: Er , you seem to know who I am , and maybe even what I am . Thanks for the eakfast .
JELLY: Oh , I know about Sissy Hankshaw , all ight . I 've done a little hitchhiking myself . Ah shucks , that 's like telling Annie Oakley you 're a sharpshoote ecause you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone . I 'd heard tales about you from people I 'd meet in jail cells and truckstops . I heard about your , uh , your , ah , your wonderful thumbs , and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac 's girl friend Sissy sets her tray on the bedside table .
SISSY: No , I 'm afraid that part is n't true . Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down . We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field , but he was hardly my lover . Besides , I always travel alone .
JELLY: Well , that does n't matter ; that part never interested me anyway . The eatnicks were before my time , and I never got anything outta the hippies ut bad dope , clichés and the clap . But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl .
SISSY: Tell me about it .
JELLY: About
SISSY: About being a cowgirl . What 's it all about ? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in adium on the side of a pearl .
JELLY: Cowgirls exist as an image . A fairly common image . The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture . Therefore , it seems to me , the existence of cowgirls should prevail . Otherwise , they 're eing fooled . In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls . Two . And both of 'em are trick-riders . Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos . Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks . That 's what prostitutes call it , you know 'tricking . '
SISSY: You 're political , then ?
JELLY: No , ma'am . No way . There 's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political , ut I do n't share their views . I got no cowgirl ideology to expound . `` Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it . ''
SISSY: Really ? The Chink , huh ? I 've gathered that you sometimes speak with him . What else have you learned from the Chink ?
JELLY: Learned from the Chink ? Oh my . Ha ha . That 's hard to say . We mostly . Uh , a lot of his talk is pretty goofy . Jelly pauses .
KYM: It 's cute . Way cuter than a cow .
DEBBIE: Goats are always testing you . They 're like Zen masters . They can tell instantly if you 're faking you feelings . So they play games with you to keep you true . People should go to goats instead of psychiatrists .
GLORIA: It 's so loving .
HEATHER: Look at those playfully wise eyes .
GLORIA: Ooo ! It licked me !
JELLY: More and more people are discovering that cow 's milk is n't fit for human consumption . Billy West says if we can produce enough goat 's milk on the ranch to make it worth his while , he 'll run it into Fargo regularly .
DELORES: I 'm aware that Tad Lucas rode broncs until her ninth month , but I do n't think pregnant cowgirls are going to e any asset on this ranch . I hope you itchy clits who are sneaking down to the lake every night are taking precautions . It 's bad enough we 've got cranes coming ; we do n't need storks . I feel that those film makers should be removed from the Rubber Rose as soon as possible . Men can cause nothing but trouble here . I also feel that our guest should be excused while we discuss this matter further . Hurt , Sissy leaves the group .
JELLY: Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week , but so far he Third Vision has n't happened . Niwetükame , the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her . Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools . Tension . Cowgirl tension ! What a drag .
SISSY: What is Debbie 's position ?
JELLY: Debbie says that if women are to take charge again , they must do it in the feminine way ; they must n't esort to aggressive and violent masculine methods . She says it is up to women to show themselves bette than men , to love men , set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age . She 's a eal dreamer , that Debbie-dear .
SISSY: You do n't agree with Debbie , then ?
JELLY: I would n't say that . I expect she 's ight , ultimately . But I 'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what 's mine . I ca n't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink ; he could probably teach her a thing or two . Ee ! That grass tickles , does n't it ? God knows I love women , ut nothing can take the place of a man that fits . Still this is cowgirl territory and I 'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it . I guess I 've always been a scrapper . Look . This scar . Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silve ullet .
DELORES: He 's here .
BIG RED: Sick as a vice squad .
DELORES: He 's in a snit . He wants to see you ight after the barbecue .
JELLY: Get the girls . He 's gon na see me ight now .
MISS ADRIAN: You will all be rounded up and sent to prison if you take this any farther ! This is not your ranch ! ! ! !
THE COUNTESS: You pathetic little cutesy-poos . Do you actually suppose this exhibition of childlike melodrama is advancing the cause of freedom ?
JELLY: You owe us this here ranch , as a token payment for your disgusting exploitations
THE COUNTESS: Then take it .
JELLY: Go for it , girls !
MISS ADRIAN: Go to your bunkhouse and remain there !
GLORIA: Better reach for your spray cans !
JELLY: Not one of these pussies has been washed in a week !
CHINK: Ha ha ho ho hee hee .
SISSY: Wait !
CHINK: Follow me . I 'll fix you supper . THE TWO doggedly walk up the steep trail .
SISSY: I 'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean 's .
CHINK: I know who you are .
SISSY: Oh ? Well , there 's been some trouble on the ranch . I came up here to get out of the way . It 's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down . If you could help
CHINK: Save your breath for the climb .
SISSY: But I do n't know how to polka .
CHINK: Neither do I ha ha ho ho hee hee .
SISSY: So this is how Jelly spends her visits to the Chink .
CHINK: Clockworks .
SISSY: Clockworks ?
CHINK: The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge . I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People .
SISSY: Siwash , huh ?
CHINK: He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer , and the honor that he extended me gave me ights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge . I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own .
SISSY: The Clock People ?
CHINK: During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp ; as a Japanese-American , I had been put there and watched over . I found refuge with the Clock People , who discovered me in a snow bank , near dead , I had een climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains .
SISSY: Then if you are Japanese , then why are you called the Chink ?
CHINK: The Clock People mistook me fo Chinese . And the name stuck . In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled `` Indians '' through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges , it is only fitting that `` Indians '' misnamed me . The Clock People , however , are not a tribe , rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes . They have lived together since 1906 .
SISSY: What do you believe in then ?
CHINK: Ha ha ho ho and hee hee .
SISSY: If this be adultery , make the most of it .
THE COUNTESS: Sissy , do n't play dumb with me ! You 're a good model but a shitty actress . The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance . You know perfectly well they are . Last seen in Nebraska . Did n't make it to Canada . Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada . The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake . And who else but Jellybean 's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tampe with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds ? How much do you know about it ? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows ?
SISSY: I do n't know anything about it .
THE COUNTESS: Sissy . You 're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches . Well , let you conscience be your guide , as my mommy used to say , but it wo n't work . Those stinking sluts are going to suffer
SURGEON: Well , he 's not out of danger , but I think we can safely say he 's going to make it . I 'd be pretty surprised if he did n't . However , there is evidence of injury to the frontal lobe , and I have reason to fear that this injury may be permanent . The patient may never again function as a normal human being .
SISSY: Brain damage ? You mean he 's going to e a vegetable ?
SURGEON: Vegetable ? Vegetable ? I would n't say that , no . We wo n't ascertain the extent of the injury for some days . But there is a genuine possibility of severe and lasting behavioral defects . I would n't classify it in the vegetable category , however .
DRIVER: I 'm going to give it to you like you 've never had it before . Oh , you did n't know it could be this good . You 're gon na like it . You 're gon na like it . You 're gon na like it so good . You 're gon na love it so much you 're gon na cry . You 're gon na cry . You 're gon na cry and cry . Do you like to cry ? Do you like it when it hurts a little bit ? Whatever happens to you , it 'll be worth it . The way I 'm gon na give it to you , it 'll be worth anything . Everything . Go ahead and cry if you want to . I like it when women cry . It means they appreciate me .
DR. DREYFUS: I 'm afraid I ca n't help you .
SISSY: But Doctor .
DREYFUS: Please , child , do n't be dismayed . We all have problems these days . But as the painter Van Gogh said , 'Mysteries emain , sorrow or melancholy remains , ut the everlasting negative is alanced by the positive work which thus is achieved , after all . ' I do n't suppose that means very much to you . I have retired . A victim of a malpractice suit .
SISSY: Oh , Doctor ! You 've got to do it . You and nobody else should be allowed to take away my gift .
DR. DREYFUS: Ah , the thumb .
SISSY: I just want to be normal , give me that old-fashioned normality . It was good enough for Crazy Horse and it 's good enough for me .
DR. DREYFUS: Ah , yes . Very well , my dear . Here is what we can do .
JELLY: Yep , the whooping cranes are here all right . They 're in fine shape , and as you musta saw from your fucking whirly machine , unrestrained , free to go as they please . But this is private property and you are n't laying a foot on it . None of you .
SHERIFF: We 'll be back with a court order and a fistful of search warrants .
JELLY: Just come back with a couple of people who know what they 're doing and we 'll let'em in for a nice close look at the birds .
DELORES: And make sure at least one of them is female , and you better do as we say or there may be trouble .
UNDERSECRETARY: It will be my extreme pleasure to eport to the President
UNDERSECRETARY VOICE: Siwash Lake and in apparently healthy condition . The crowd cheers .
UNDERSECRETARY: .hatched chicks there . Counting the young birds , there are now approximately sixty cranes in the flock . While this is good news , it is also quite bewildering
NEWS REPORTER: The Rubber Rose Ranch has issued a communiqué that was sent to the federal judge and copies of a ecording to the press , today . We can hear the voice of Bonanza Jellybean
SISSY: That 's Jellybean !
KYM: Man , this is the stupidest music I 've ever heard . This radio should have stayed in the privy where it elongs .
SISSY: Howdy . Kym gets off her horse and hugs Sissy .
KYM: You know what you 're getting into if you come over to the lake
SISSY: Yes , but I want to be there . I want to see Jellybean . I want to see the cranes .
KYM: We heard on the radio that the judge has set Delores 's bail at fifty thousand dollars . Now she wo n't be here when we really need her .
JELLY: Let 's celebrate !
AGENT: Ai n't that just like women .
JELLY: Looks like every time we get togethe things are in a mess .
SISSY: So be it . It looks serious this time , though . All these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes ?
JELLY: Hell no , the cranes are wonderful , okay , but I 'm not in this for whooping cranes . I 'm in it for cowgirls . If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue , then cowgirls become just another compromise . I want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl . Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised .
SISSY: How did this business get started , anyhow ? Why are the birds nesting here ?
DEBBIE: You were aware that we were feeding them , were n't you ? We fed them brown ice and they stayed over a couple of extra days . Then we decided to try something different . We mixed our brown rice with fishmeal whoopers love seafood , and fishmeal is cheap . Then Delores suggested another ingredient , and we think that 's what did the trick .
SISSY: You mean
JELLY: Aw , come off it , Sissy . What do you mean , 'drugged ' ? Every living thing is a chemical composition and anything that is added to it changes that composition . When you eat a cheeseburger or a Three Musketeers ar , it changes your body chemistry . The kind of food you eat , the kind of air you breathe , can change you mental state . Does that mean you 're 'drugged ' ?
SISSY: No , I guess not .
JELLY: 'Drugged ' is a stupid word .
SISSY: But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains . It 's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years .
DEBBIE: The way I see it , is that the peyote mellowed them out . Made them less uptight . They were afraid of bad weather and humans . That 's why they migrated and kept to themselves . But the peyote has enlightened them . It 's taught them there is nothing to fear but fear itself . Now they 're digging life and letting the bad vibes slide on . Do n't worry , be happy . Be here now .
SISSY: Fear in wild animals is completely different from paranoia in people . In the wilderness ecosystem , fear is natural and necessary . It 's merely a mechanism for maintaining life . If the cranes had n't had a capacity fo fear , they would have disappeared long ago and you 'd be having to get loaded with common old everyday meadowlarks and mallards .
JELLY: This here discussion is destined to ecome academic . Because we 've got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left and Delores 's run ended up in the Mottburg jail . So any day now we 'll get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down , to see if the peyote experience really changed them or not . But in the meantime , I want to say this about fear..
ANNOUNCER: Judge Greenfield , at the request of the ACLU , has granted a forty-eight- hour extension of the deadline by which the Rubber Rose cowgirls must comply with his order . Negotiations etween the cowgirls and the government are expected to follow . Another item in , the forewoman of the Rubber Rose Ranch , a Delores del Ruby is now free on bond after having een arrested in Mottburg with more than fifty pounds of peyote buttons . Her bail has been paid by the owne of the besieged ranch , Countess Products , Inc. Miss del Ruby 's bail having come from the tycoon 's personal advisor , a certain Dr. Robbins of New York City .
SISSY: Dr. Robbins ?
JELLY: Every time I tell you that I love you , you flinch . But that 's you problem .
SISSY: If I flinch when you say you love me , it 's both our problems . My confusion becomes your confusion . Students confuse teachers , patients confuse psychiatrists , lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts .
DELORES: It is n't for ourselves that we take this stand . It is n't for cowgirls . It 's for all the daughters everywhere . This is an extremely important confrontation . This is womankind 's chance to prove to her enemy that she 's willing to fight and die . If we women do n't show here and now that we are n't afraid to fight and die , then our enemy will never take us seriously . Men will always know that , no matter how strong our words and determined our deeds , there 's a point where we 'll back down and give them their way .
DONNA: I 'll fight the bastards .
BIG RED: I 'll fight 'em with bean gas , if necessary . Delores snaps her whip again .
DELORES: The sun 's going down . Let 's those of us not standing watch get some sleep . In the morning we 'll plan our fight . Tomorrow afternoon those of you who 'd like can join me in the reeds , where the cranes and I will be sharing the last crumbs left in the peyote sack .
JELLY: Well , what we got to do is one of us has got to go up that hill and tell them boys that America can have its whooping cranes back . Since I 'm the oss here , and since I 'm responsible for a lot of you choosing to be cowgirls in the first place , it 's gon na be me that goes Small protests from the circle of cowgirls .
COWGIRL: Jelly ! Please ! But Jelly is already on her way .
JELLY: Better get rid of these . Might give those greenhorn dudes a fright .
AGENT: She 's going to fire .
VOICE: You 've got two minutes to come out with you hands over your heads !
JELLY: Right in the scar where I fell on a wooden horse when I was twelve . Haw , I was n't really shot with a silve ullet . Confessing to Sissy .
A VOICE: The brown paper bag is the only thing civilized man has produced that does not seem out of place in nature . Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles , like the fossilized brain of a dryad ; its kinship to tree unobscured by the cruel crush of industry ; absorbing the elements like any other organic entity ; lending with rock and vegetation as if it were a burrowing owl 's doo mat or a jack rabbit 's underwear , a No . 8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded in the hills of Dakota and appeared to live where it lay . Once long ago , it had borne a package of buns and a jar of mustard to a kitchenette endezvous with a fried hamburger . More recently , the bag had held.. love letters . View of a bunkhouse trunk .
VOICE: As a hole in an oak hides a squirrel 's family jewels , the bag had hidden love letters in the bottom of a unkhouse trunk .
DELORES: You know , podner , you can tune a guitar but you ca n't tuna fish . She plunks a few notes .
SISSY: Is everything getting worse ?
CHINK: Yes , everything is getting worse . But everything is also getting better .
SISSY: The Countess has come to our aid . The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls . And I have been asked to oversee the ranch . For $ 300 a week . And as it turns out , the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was here 's a picture !
CHINK: I want to go back to the Clock People . I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they 're up to . What 's happened to Jelly ?
SISSY: She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City .
CHINK: You mean she 's dead ? The Chink mourns a bit .
SISSY: But that 's an old story now I ca n't believe that you would leave the Butte .
CHINK: Easy come , easy go .
DELORES: Wow , you sure have a way with words .
CHINK: I ca n't help it if I grew up in an antipoetic culture . Language will be different when I 'm with the Clock People though . They 're from an oral tradition . And I 'm not talking about what you horny hop toads do in bed every night . The Chink smiles . Delores blushes .
SISSY: Well , if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world , drop us a postcard .
CHINK: The world is n't going to end , you dummy ; I hope you know that much . But it is going to change . It 's going to change drastically , and probably in your lifetime . The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change , and they may be ight , since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and majo ones are long overdue . But there are far worse catastrophes coming unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization , in other words , unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption . It is n't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes , but that ou operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault . So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan , all right , but there 'll be some of us it 'll miss . Little pockets of humanity . Like the Clock People . Like you two honeys , if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave . There 's almost no worldwide calamity famine , nuclea accident , plague , weather warfare o eduction of the ozone shield that you could n't survive in that cave .
SISSY: How am I going to be the progenito of a tribe when I 'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores ?
CHINK: That 's your problem . The Chink coughs .
WEIR: I miss you .
HOLLIS: I apologize for the short notice , Bill , but we 've had something come up that requires your immediate attention . Lyle ?
LYLE: At oh-three-hundred this morning , TDRSS picked up an automated navigation beacon broadcasting at two minute intervals in Neptune orbit .
WEIR: Incredible These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this , this happened ? This is n't some kind of hoax ?
HOLLIS: I would n't bring you here on a hoax . Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D . codes .
WEIR: It 's the Event Horizon . She 's come ack . Hollis answers drily .
HOLLIS: That ship was lost in deep space , seven years ago . If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor , I 'd find it more plausible . Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team , investigate the source of the transmission . If it really is the Event Horizon , they 'll attempt a salvage . We need you to prepare a detailed iefing on the ship 's systems fo the salvage crew
WEIR: A written briefing ca n't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this . I have to go with them . Lyle looks at Weir , stunned by the request .
LYLE: Dr. Weir , you have no experience with salvage procedures .
WEIR: I designed the ship 's propulsion system . I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive . You ca n't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed . That would e like like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle .
LYLE: I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation , Dr. Weir , but it does n't factor into this .
WEIR: This is not about my reputation ! This is not about me at all ! The Event Horizon was created fo one reason to go faster than light . Imagine mankind exploring new sola systems , colonizing new worlds . Seven years ago , we did n't just lose the ship and the crew . We lost the dream . I have to go .
HOLLIS: It 's not that simple . Lyle , play the recording for Dr. Weir .
LYLE: Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel . This was the only response .
WEIR: The crew ? Could they still be alive ?
LYLE: The ship had life support systems for eighteen months . They 're been gone seven years .
WEIR: Someone sent that message . Admiral , you have to put me on that ship .
HOLLIS: It 's against my better judgement , ut I 'll run this by the Man downstairs . You 'll know my decision y the end of the day .
WEIR: Thank you .
HOLLIS: Do n't thank me , Bill . I 'm not doing you any favors . Weir leaves . The door closes behind him .
LYLE: You 're not seriously considering sending him ?
HOLLIS: You do n't just dismiss Bill Weir . The man held Oppenheimer 's chair at Princeton . If the Event Horizon had worked , he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein .
LYLE: The official inquiry blamed Weir 's design for the ship 's loss .
HOLLIS: That does n't mean a damn thing . They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill . But he 's not esponsible for what happened to the ship .
LYLE: Does he know that ?
HOLLIS: What 's on your mind ?
LYLE: He does n't belong on this mission . Responsible or not , he blames himself . He 's too close to it . And then there 's his wife .
HOLLIS: It 's been two years since she died . He 's over it .
LYLE: Some things you do n't get over . Beat .
HOLLIS: I want our best people on this . Where 's Miller ?
LYLE: The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt , she 's docked in bay four .
SMITH: I ca n't believe this , I have n't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit . Why not Mars , Cap , Mars has women
STARCK: Smith 's right . Neptune ? There 's nothing out there . If something happens , we 'll be on our own .
MILLER: I do n't like it either , but you know the rules we get the call , we go . Is the course locked in ?
SMITH: Locked and cocked .
STARCK: We 're past the outer marker , we can engage the ion drive whenever you 're eady .
MILLER: Justin ?
JUSTIN: Everything green on my boards , Skipper .
MILLER: Start the countdown .
STARCK: Ion drive will engage in T-minus ten minutes .
MILLER: Let 's go .
COOPER: Time to play Spam in the can .
MILLER: Do n't start with me , Cooper . Cooper falls in as the crew continues into
WEIR: Captain Miller , I just want to say
MILLER: The clock is running , Dr. Weir . If you 'll follow the rest of the crew , they 'll show you to the gravity tanks .
PETERS: Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers . Good for four months .
MILLER: I put in for a replacement for you ut no one
PETERS: No , no , its alright . I talked to my ex , he 'll keep Denny over Christmas and I 'll get him this summer . Goddam it , Skipper I have n't seen him in two months .
MILLER: I am sorry . But now we have to go to work .
COOPER: Is that an offer ?
STARCK: It is not .
WEIR: Captain Miller , I appreciate this opportunity
MILLER: Doctor Weir , my crew is not going on your mission because we want to . We were pulled off a well deserved leave , to be sent out to the middle of nowhere , and no one 's even told us why .
WEIR: I 've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space .
MILLER: Until then , do what you 're told and stay out of my way .
PETERS: First time in a grav couch ?
WEIR: Yes .
PETERS: Do n't worry about it . He 's hard , but he 's fair . You 're lucky to be shipping out with him . He 's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach .
WEIR: He 's been past Mars ?
PETERS: He served on the Goliath .
WEIR: Was n't that ship destroyed ?
PETERS: They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan . The shuttle 's oh-two tanks ruptured during the escue , flooded both ships with pure oxygen . There was a spark and both ships were incinerated . The Skippe and three others just made it to a lifeboat . Captain Miller was able
DJ: He does n't like to talk about it . DJ swathes one of Weir 's arms with alcohol .
WEIR: I 've seen the effect on mice . The overhead lights change to red .
MILLER: Five minutes . DJ hands him the breathing mask .
DJ: Put this on . Weir does . DJ checks the fit .
PETERS: You 'll be fine . You 'll wake up and we 'll be there . Watch your fingers .
DJ: Heart-rate decreasing body temp dropping to 80 70 60 50 40 degrees Fahrenheit . He 's in stasis .
VOICE: Billy Weir opens his eyes .
WEIR: Claire ?
CLAIRE: I 'm so cold
WEIR: Claire
PETERS: DJ ! It 's okay . You 're okay . Just breathe .
WEIR: I 'm alright now . I 'm alright DJ helps him to his feet .
DJ: Move slowly . You 've been in stasis for fifty-six days . You 're going to experience a little disorientation . Weir nods .
COOPER: Damn , Dr. Weir , do n't scare us like that . Coffee ?
WEIR: What ?
COOPER: Coffee .
WEIR: No , thank you .
COOPER: Hey , Starck . You wan na dry my back ? Starck gives him a cool once over .
STARCK: Maybe when you finish puberty . Miller zips up .
MILLER: Starck , why are n't you on the bridge ?
STARCK: I just finished drying
MILLER: Then what are you doing here ? Come on , people , let 's go ! And Cooper Put some pants on .
DENNY: Play horsey , Mommy , play horsey
PETERS: Want to play horsey , do you
SMITH: 30 hours to Neptune orbit .
STARCK: All boards are green , everything 's five by five .
MILLER: That 's good to know . Justin , you wan na stow that ? Justin catches the ball , holds onto it .
COOPER: You can call him Baby-bear , he loves that
MILLER: This is Cooper , what the hell do you do on this ship , anyway ?
JUSTIN: Ballast .
COOPER: I am your best friend . I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
MILLER: He 's a rescue technician . Peters , medical technician . DJ
DJ: Trauma .
MILLER: And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir . We all know where we 're going . Dr. Weir is going to tell us why .
WEIR: What I am about to tell you is considered code-black by the NSA .
JUSTIN: That means top-secret , Cooper .
COOPER: I heard it .
WEIR: The USAC intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune . The source has been identified as the Event Horizon . STUNNED SILENCE . Then everyone talks at once
STARCK: That 's impossible ! She was lost with all hands , what , seven
JUSTIN: Seven years ago , the reactor blew
PETERS: How can we salvage ?
SMITH: Let the dead rest , man
COOPER: cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission !
MILLER: EVERYBODY SHUT UP ! Let the man speak . In the quiet that follows
WEIR: What was made public about the Event Horizon , that she was a deep space esearch vessel , that its reacto went critical , that the ship blew up None of that is true . The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster- than-light flight .
SMITH: You ca n't do that .
STARCK: The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel
WEIR: Relativity , yes . We ca n't break the law of relativity , but we can go around it . The ship does n't really move faster than the speed of light ; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously `` jump '' from one point in the universe to another , light years away .
STARCK: How ?
WEIR: Well , in layman 's terms , you use a otating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons ; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity
COOPER: Laymen 's terms .
SMITH: Hey
WEIR: Say this paper represents space-time , and you want to get from `` point A '' here to `` point B , '' here . Now what 's the shortest distance etween two points ?
STARCK: A straight line .
WEIR: Wrong . The shortest distance between two points
JUSTIN: How do you know all this ?
WEIR: I built it . Even Cooper is impressed .
COOPER: I can see why they sent you along .
JUSTIN: So if the ship did n't blow up , what happened ?
WEIR: It was the ship 's maiden voyage , to test the drive . The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters . They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive . And the ship vanished from all ou scopes . No radar contact , no enhanced optical , no radio contact of any kind . They disappeared without a trace . Until now .
MILLER: Where has it been for the last seven years ?
WEIR: That 's what we 're here to find out .
SMITH: What the hell is that ?
PETERS: It does n't sound like anything human .
WEIR: Houston has passed the recording through several filters and isolated what appears to be a human voice .
SMITH: Jesus
MILLER: What is that ?
DJ: It sounds like Latin .
COOPER: Latin ? Who the fuck speaks Latin ?
STARCK: No one . It 's a dead language .
DJ: Mostly dead .
MILLER: What does it say ?
WEIR: NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
DJ: `` Liberatis me . '' `` Save me . ''
COOPER: From what ?
MILLER: You 're convinced the crew could still e alive ? After seven years ?
WEIR: The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months . It seems impossible , but in light of the transmission I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now .
COOPER: Skipper , do we get hazard pay fo this ?
MILLER: You heard the tape , Smith . We 're looking for survivors .
STARCK: Crossing the horizon . Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees .
MILLER: Come around to three-three-four
SMITH: Heading three-three-four
MILLER: Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
SMITH: One-four degrees
MILLER: Bring us in tight . Starck , get on the horn , see if anyone 's listening
STARCK: This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark , hailing Event Horizon , Event Horizon , do you ead ? This is the Lewis and Clark , hailing
SMITH: Matching speed now . Range to target ten thousand meters and closing Skipper , I got a bad feeling about this
MILLER: We 're all on edge , Smith . We 're a long way out
SMITH: That 's not it . That ship was built to go faster than light That 's just wrong , it goes against everything we know
MILLER: What are you trying to say ? `` If God had intended Man to fly , he would have given us wings ? ''
SMITH: Something like that , yeah . Miller grins grimly .
MILLER: I guess we 're about to find out . Keep us slow and steady .
SMITH: Yes , sir .
MILLER: Dr. Weir ! Weir sticks his head into the bridge .
WEIR: Where is she ?
SMITH: Dead ahead , 5000 meters . Suddenly , the ship SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY .
MILLER: I noticed . Starck , anybody home ?
STARCK: If they are , they 're screening thei calls .
SMITH: Range 3000 meters and closing .
WEIR: I ca n't see anything
SMITH: 1500 meters . We 're getting too close
MILLER: Where is it ?
STARCK: The scope is lit , it 's right in front of us
SMITH: 1000 meters
MILLER: Starck
STARCK: It should be right there She looks up , trails off
MILLER: Reverse thrusters full !
SMITH: Jesus , that is one big ugly fat fucker
WEIR: She 's not ugly .
SMITH: Range 500 meters and holding . Turbulence is dropping off
STARCK: Picking up magnetic interference .
MILLER: Put it through TACS . Smith , you up for a flyby ?
SMITH: Love to .
STARCK: Look at the size of that thing .
WEIR: Foredecks . Crew quarters , bridge , medical and science labs , hydroponics , what have you . That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area . Can we move in closer ?
SMITH: Shit , Doc , any closer and we 're gon na need a rubber
MILLER: Do it .
WEIR: That 's the engineering containment . And there 's the main airlock . We can dock there .
MILLER: Smith , use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster .
WEIR: Be careful . It 's not a load bearing structure
SMITH: It is now . We 're locked in .
MILLER: Starck , give me a read .
STARCK: The reactor 's still hot . We 've got several small radiation sources , leaks probably . Nothing serious .
WEIR: Do they have pressure ?
STARCK: Affirmative . The hull 's intact ut there 's no gravity and the thermal units are off line . I 'm showing deep cold . The crew could n't survive unless they were in stasis .
MILLER: Find 'em , Starck . Starck frowns at her display .
STARCK: Something 's wrong with the bio-scan .
MILLER: Radiation interference ?
STARCK: There 's not enough radiation to throw off the scan . I 'm picking up trace life forms , but I ca n't get a lock on the location .
WEIR: Could it be the crew ? If they were in suspended animation , would n't that effect the scan ?
STARCK: If they were in stasis , I 'd get a location , but these readings , they 're all over the ship . It does n't make any sense .
MILLER: Okay . We do it the hard way . Deck by deck , room by room . Starck , deploy the umbilicus . I believe you 're up for a walk , Mr. Justin . Go get you onnet on .
JUSTIN: Yes , sir ! Weir starts to follow Justin from the bridge .
MILLER: Dr. Weir , I need you on the bridge .
WEIR: Captain , I did n't come out here to sit on your bridge , I need to be on that ship
MILLER: Once the ship is secured , we 'll bring you on board
WEIR: That is not acceptable
MILLER: once we 've secured the ship , that 's the way it is ! I need you to guide us from the comm station . This is where I need you . Help us to do our job . Weir exhales .
WEIR: Very well .
COOPER: come on , Skipper , I already put my shoes on
MILLER: You 've had plenty EVA , Coop , it 's Justin 's turn . Stay on station . If anything happens
COOPER: I 'll be all over it . Miller nods to Peters .
PETERS: Opening inner airlock door .
COOPER: You still need the rope ? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins .
JUSTIN: I 'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it . Now step aside , old man .
COOPER: You just keep your nose clean , Baby Bear . Clear the door .
WEIR: You 've reached the outer airlock door .
PETERS: We 've got pressure .
MILLER: Clear and open on my mark . Three two one mark .
PETERS: Jesus its huge .
MILLER: Ice crystals everywhere . This place is a deep freeze .
JUSTIN: Not a chance , sir .
MILLER: Dr. Weir , what 's this ?
PETERS: Here 's another one . They 're all ove the place .
MILLER: I can see that , what 're they for ?
WEIR: In an emergency , the charges detonate in series , destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship . That way , if the gravity drive malfunctions , the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat .
PETERS: That means they did n't abandon ship .
MILLER: So where are they ? Starck , any luck with the bio-scan ?
STARCK: I 'm running diagnostics now , Skipper Nothing 's wrong with the sensor pack , I 'm still getting trace life readings , all over the ship .
PETERS: There 's no one in the corridor but us .
MILLER: Peters is right , no one 's here .
PETERS: I do n't know , this place is really dark , I ca n't see a thing
MILLER: Easy , Peters , we 're okay , we 're okay . Let 's finish the sweep .
PETERS: I can see the hatch .
MILLER: Starck , you still showing those eadings ?
PETERS: We found the gravity couches .
WEIR: Any survivors ?
MILLER: They 're empty , Dr. Weir . Moving forward .
JUSTIN: We still have pressure . The radiation count 's steady at 7 millirads an hour .
PETERS: Dr. Weir , what 's this the door to ?
MILLER: If we saw any crew , Doctor , you 'd know about it . I 'm in Medical . No casualties , it looks like this place has never been used . He finds a computer console .
PETERS: I found something .
WEIR: Yes , we can see some kind of mist . What is that ?
PETERS: There 's no one here .
MILLER: The science workstation has power , I 'll see if I can find the crew from here .
WEIR: Ms. Peters , turn back and to you left , please .
STARCK: What is it ?
WEIR: Ship 's log .
PETERS: It 's stuck .
JUSTIN: I 've reached another containment door . This thing 's huge
PETERS: It 's really jammed in there .
STARCK: What happened to his eyes ?
SMITH: Explosive decompression .
STARCK: Decompression would n't do that .
COOPER: Hey , Baby Bear , Mama Bear got a corpsicle for ya No reply .
JUSTIN: Uh , yeah Coop , I 'm still here .
COOPER: Justin ?
JUSTIN: I think I found something
SMITH: What the hell is that ?
WEIR: That 's the Core the gravity drive . The heart of the ship .
PETERS: Crystallized .
JUSTIN: Almost done , I just got ta check one thing Justin turns to the Core
STARCK: Justin , hold on a sec , you 're breaking up
WEIR: What is it ?
STARCK: I do n't know . The life readings just went off the scale .
SMITH: Something 's wrong
MILLER: What the hell
STARCK: Miller , do you read me , Peters
SMITH: Get them back
STARCK: I 'm trying , goddammit
COOPER: What 's happening ?
DJ: He 's in trouble . Go !
COOPER: I 'm gone !
MILLER: Boarding party , sound off Peters , do you read me . Peters
PETERS: Denny
MILLER: Peters , do you read me
VOICE: Do n't leave me
MILLER: Justin ? Justin , sound off Justin !
COOPER: Hold on , Baby Bear
STARCK: Here comes another one ! Hold on !
SMITH: The safety circuit 's failed !
WEIR: We 're losing atmosphere
STARCK: There are pressure suits in the Airlock . Go !
MILLER: Can anybody hear me
PETERS: Yeah . I 'm I 'm okay .
MILLER: Coop , where are you
SMITH: We have a situation here
MILLER: Do we have enough time for a weld ?
SMITH: We 're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked . In three minutes , ou atmosphere will be gone . We are fucking dead .
MILLER: No one 's dying on my watch , Smith ! What about the reserve tanks ?
WEIR: The Event Horizon . The others turn to stare at Weir .
SMITH: What ?
WEIR: It still has air and reserve power , we can activate gravity and life support .
STARCK: What if the air has gone bad ? We ca n't wear these suits forever .
SMITH: I do n't think this is a good idea , we do n't even know what happened on that ship
WEIR: It beats dying , Mister Smith .
MILLER: Dr. Weir 's right . Get on board the Event Horizon . I 'll meet you at the airlock .
PETERS: I 'm ahead of you . Bringing the thermal units on line
MILLER: Everybody okay ?
STARCK: We 're all here .
MILLER: Okay . Let 's find out how much time we just bought .
DJ: We have n't tested the air yet . It could be contaminated
MILLER: No time . We need whatever 's left in our suits to repair the Clark . Like it or not , this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers .
STARCK: It tastes bad .
MILLER: But you can breathe it .
STARCK: The antennae array 's completely fried , we 've got no radio , no laser , no highgain No one 's going to be coming to help us .
MILLER: How much oh-two do we have ?
STARCK: Oxygen is not the problem .
MILLER: Carbon dioxide ?
STARCK: It 's building up with every breath we take . And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot .
MILLER: We can take the filters from the Clark
STARCK: I thought of that , with the filters from the Clark , we 've got enough eathable air for twenty hours . After that , we 'd better be on ou way home .
MILLER: What about the life readings you picked up ?
STARCK: The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing `` Bio-readings of indeterminate origin . '' Right before that wave hit the Clark , there was some kind of surge , right off the scale , but now it 's back to its previous levels .
MILLER: What 's causing the readings ?
STARCK: I do n't know , but whatever it is , it 's not the crew .
MILLER: So where is the rest of the crew ? We 've been over every inch of this ship and all we 've found is blood . Dr. Weir ? Any suggestions ? Weir just stares at the bloodstained wall .
SMITH: Captain Miller , you copy ?
MILLER: How is he ?
DJ: His vitals are stable , but he 's unresponsive to stimuli . He might wake up in fifteen minutes . He might not wake up at all .
PETERS: What happened to him ?
MILLER: DJ , take samples from these stains , compare them to medical records , I want to know whose blood this is .
PETERS: I can use the station in Medical , keep an eye on Justin
MILLER: Fine . Starck , I want you to repeat the bio-scan
STARCK: What 's the point ? I 'll just get the same thing
MILLER: Not acceptable . I want to know what 's causing those readings . If the crew is dead , I want the bodies , I want the crew found .
STARCK: I can reconfigure the scan for C-12 , amylase proteins .
MILLER: Do it . Dr. Weir
WEIR: Yes .
MILLER: One of my men is down . I want to know what happened to him .
COOPER: I told you . He was inside the Core Weir starts shaking his head .
WEIR: No , he did n't .
COOPER: You were n't there . I saw it .
WEIR: Saw what , Mr. Cooper ? What did you eally see , because what you 're describing is not physically possible
MILLER: Cooper ! Enough ! Cooper sits down .
WEIR: I do n't know what happened to Justin .
COOPER: I 'm telling you , I saw it
WEIR: What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion .
COOPER: I know what I saw and it was n't a fucking `` optical effect ! ''
MILLER: Hold on , what 's this `` gravitational distortion ? ''
WEIR: It 's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core , distorting space-time . They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark .
MILLER: What could cause them ? What 's in the Core ?
WEIR: It 's complicated
MILLER: How much time do you need ? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes . Now what is in the Core ? Beat . Here comes another bomb
WEIR: A black hole . The crew stares at him , stunned .
STARCK: I ca n't believe we built this .
MILLER: It 's insane .
WEIR: `` Insane ? '' The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship . It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star . The Event Horizon could be there in a day
MILLER: If it worked .
WEIR: If it worked , yes .
MILLER: I want this room sealed . The Second Containment is off limits .
WEIR: There 's no danger . The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields , it 's under control .
MILLER: Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart . It may have killed one of my men . No one goes near that thing .
PETERS: Justin ?
DENNY: Mommy
DJ: What 's wrong ?
PETERS: Nothing . It 's nothing .
COOPER: You been out there a long time . Trying to break my record ?
SMITH: I 'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can . This ship is ad . It watches you .
COOPER: What ?
SMITH: You heard me . This ship , it 's crazy trying to go faster ' n light , that 's like the Tower of Babel .
COOPER: Shit , Smith , you 're going Biblical on me .
SMITH: You know what happened to the Towe of Babel , do n't you ? It fell down .
COOPER: You 're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix .
STARCK: Why Dr. Weir , I think you 're in love .
WEIR: Hmmm . Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her . I told her that was n't true , I just knew the Event Horizon better , that 's all .
STARCK: Claire is your wife ?
WEIR: Yes .
STARCK: It must be hard , being so far away from her .
WEIR: Yes . I miss her . She died . Two years now .
STARCK: I 'm sorry .
WEIR: These things happen . Wait a minute , that 's not right
MILLER: You have something , Dr. Weir ?
WEIR: The date .
MILLER: What about it ?
WEIR: The Event Horizon 's computer think 's it 's 2034 .
MILLER: It 's 2041
WEIR: Exactly . The ship 's internal clock is off by seven years .
STARCK: Maybe a power interruption crashed the system
WEIR: No , there 's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind . It 's as if time just stopped for seven years .
MILLER: Explanation ?
WEIR: Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time , it 's possible Black holes make sense on paper , it 's all math , you see , but as to what really happened The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality , and like Lazarus , returned from the dead . The INTERCOM interrupts them
PETERS: The speaker is the mission commander
WEIR: John Kilpack .
MILLER: I wonder if they ever made it .
KILPACK: I just want to say how proud I am of my crew . I 'd like to name my station heads Chris Chambers , Janice Rubin , Dick Smith , Tom Fender and Stacie Collins . And to Bill Weir and all the scientists that got us here .
MILLER: What the hell is that ? Dr. Weir ?
WEIR: I do n't know .
PETERS: I can run the image through a series of filters , try to clean it up .
MILLER: Do it .
PETERS: What 's happening ?
DJ: A power drain
MILLER: We barely have enough power for life support as it is , if we ca n't stop the drain , we 're not gon na make it .
WEIR: The Core ! Weir heads for the door .
MILLER: Wait ! But Weir has vanished into the corridor .
WEIR: The magnetic fields are holding . Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit . I 'll check it out .
MILLER: We do n't get the power back , ou air 's gon na go bad .
WEIR: Check the Core for radiation . Carbon dioxide may be the least of ou worries .
STARCK: What the hell
STARCK: Skipper , the bio-scan just went off the scale
DJ: Justin ! Can you hear me ? Justin !
WEIR: There you are .
VOICE: Billy .
MILLER: We just lost all power in here . Dr. Weir ?
BURNING MAN: Do n't leave me
WEIR: Claire ? Weir bangs his flashlight . Again . Again
CLAIRE: So cold . His flashlight flickers again , snaps on
DJ: Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations , impaired judgement
MILLER: Goddammit , DJ , it was not a hallucination ! I saw a man , he was on fire . And then he disappeared .
STARCK: Maybe one of the original crew ?
MILLER: No . It was someone else .
STARCK: Who ?
MILLER: Dr. Weir , you were right there , you must have heard something , seen something
WEIR: No . I saw nothing .
PETERS: I did . All heads turn to her .
WEIR: Is n't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge ?
PETERS: I 've seen bodies before . This is different . She falls silent , unwilling to say more .
MILLER: Peters is right . Its like something eaching into your mind . Seeing you thoughts and making them real . Smith , did you or Cooper experience anything unusual ? Smith , leaning against the doorway
SMITH: I did n't see anything and I do n't have to see anything . This ship is fucked .
WEIR: Thank you for that scientific analysis , Mister Smith .
SMITH: Hey ! You do n't need to be a scientist figure it out
MILLER: Smith Weir 's face is stone .
SMITH: you break all the laws of physics , you think there wo n't be a price ? You already killed the first crew
MILLER: That 's enough !
DJ: I 'm sorry , I I do n't know why I did that .
WEIR: Carbon dioxide . Smith goes for Weir .
SMITH: He 's fucking lying , you know something ! Miller heads him off , grabs him .
MILLER: That 's it , that 's enough for one day , Smith ! I need you back on the Clark , I need you calm , I need you using your head , you make a mistake out there , none of are getting home , you understand ? Smith calms .
SMITH: Sir .
MILLER: Get outside , go back to work . I 'll join you shortly . Smith leaves .
WEIR: I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity , that should prevent another power drain .
MILLER: Do it .
DJ: To conserve our oxygen , we should severely restrict our activity . Anyone who can should get some sleep .
MILLER: I do n't need sleep , DJ . I need answers . Miller exits . Starck follows .
STARCK: Miller
MILLER: What is it , Starck ?
STARCK: I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter . The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin
MILLER: `` bio-readings of indeterminate origin , '' do n't you have anything useful to tell me ?
STARCK: I 've got a theory . Miller stops .
MILLER: Go ahead .
STARCK: There was a another surge in the bio- eadings right before you you saw what you saw . We picked up a simila eadings right before the Clarke was damaged . What if there were a connection between the two ? The gravity waves , the hallucination , all part of an defensive reaction , like an immune system Miller starts walking again .
MILLER: I do n't need to hear this . She rushes to follow .
STARCK: You 've got to listen
MILLER: To what ? What are you saying ? This ship is alive ?
STARCK: I did n't say that , I said the bio- eadings correspond to what happened to you , the ship is reacting to us
MILLER: We 're hanging on by our fingernails and you 're giving me bullshit stories She grabs him by the arm .
STARCK: It 's not bullshit , it 's the only conclusion the data supports
MILLER: Starck , do you know how crazy that sounds ? It 's impossible .
STARCK: I know that . Beat . Miller allows himself to relax .
MILLER: If you knew it was impossible , then why 'd you waste my time ?
STARCK: I thought you wanted an answer . And that 's the only one I have .
MILLER: What I want is to survive the next ten hours .
STARCK: Nine hours and twenty-two minutes .
MILLER: I 'm going outside to work on the Clark . And Starck do n't tell anyone what you just told me . We 've got enough to worry about . She nods . He locks his helmet into place .
PETERS: Justin ?
DJ: What 's wrong ?
PETERS: You did n't hear it ? You must have heard it !
STARCK: Heard what ?
PETERS: Oh nothing DJ crosses to Peters , concerned .
DJ: Sit down As he reaches out to touch her
PETERS: Stop it ! Stop it !
DJ: What is it ? Weir slowly walks to the door .
STARCK: What are you doing ?
WEIR: It wants me . I have to go . He reaches for the door .
STARCK: No !
WEIR: I 'm alright . Please .
STARCK: What is it ?
WEIR: The forward airlock .
STARCK: Miller , Smith , Cooper , any of you in the airlock ?
PETERS: Justin .
PETERS: Justin , no !
COOPER: We 'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU .
SMITH: What about the accumulator ? Starck 's VOICE breaks in
MILLER: What 's going on in there , Starck ?
STARCK: He 's awake , he 's in the airlock , he 's not wearing a suit .
MILLER: Stay here ! Do n't stop working !
COOPER: But Justin
MILLER: I 'll get him .
STARCK: He 's engaged the override .
PETERS: Can you shut it down ? She opens the Airlock access panel .
STARCK: I 'll try . DJ , you better get you ag of tricks .
PETERS: Justin ! Open the door !
MILLER: I 'm on my way , Starck .
PETERS: The door , Justin ! Open the door !
JUSTIN: Did you hear it ?
PETERS: Yes . Yes , Justin , we heard it .
STARCK: Keep him talking .
PETERS: Do you know what it was ?
JUSTIN: It gets inside you . It shows you things horrible things
PETERS: Justin , look at me . Look at me . Open this door . DJ runs up with his medkit .
STARCK: I do n't think she can talk him down . We need a sedative .
DJ: If he opens the outer door he 'll turn inside-out .
STARCK: Almost got it .
JUSTIN: If you could see the things I 've seen , you would n't try to stop me . You 'd come with me .
COMPUTER: Stand-by for decompression . Thirty seconds
JUSTIN: Hey , Mama-Bear what are doing ?
PETERS: Starck !
STARCK: I ca n't ! The inner door ca n't open once the outer door has been triggered , it would decompress the entire ship !
JUSTIN: You got ta open , you got ta stop it , please
PETERS: We have to do something , oh God
STARCK: Skipper , Justin just activated the door . It 's on a thirty second delay
MILLER: Patch me through to him .
JUSTIN: Skipper , you got ta help me
COMPUTER: Twenty seconds .
JUSTIN: tell them to open the door
MILLER: You 're not going to die ! Not today ! I want you to do exactly as I say and I 'm gon na get you out of there , alright ?
JUSTIN: But I ca n't I got ta get out of here Skipper , please
MILLER: Justin . I wo n't let you die .
JUSTIN: Okay okay
MILLER: Tuck yourself into a crouched position , shut your eyes as tight as you can !
STARCK: Five seconds .
MILLER: Exhale everything you got , Baby Bear , we ca n't have any air in those lungs , low it all out
JUSTIN: Oh god He wheezes out all his air
PETERS: Oh God Justin
DJ: Pressure ?
PETERS: 90 over 50 and falling .
DJ: He 's crashing
MILLER: We 'll make it .
STARCK: CO2 levels will reach toxic levels in four hours .
MILLER: Peters . We need to know what happened to the crew . Before it happens to us .
PETERS: I 'll get back to the log . But on the idge , I wo n't go back , back in there
MILLER: Thanks . Peters exits .
STARCK: Justin said something about , `` The dark inside me '' What did he mean ?
WEIR: It means nothing .
MILLER: Is that your `` expert opinion ? '' The only answer we 've had out of you is `` I do n't know . ''
WEIR: Justin just tried to kill himself . The man is clearly insane .
DJ: How would you explain your own ehavior ?
WEIR: What ?
STARCK: On the bridge . You said `` it '' wanted you . Weir glances at Justin
WEIR: I said that ?
DJ: Yes . You did .
WEIR: I do n't remember saying that . Maybe I 'm insane , too . Weir exits .
MILLER: I want to know what caused that noise . I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock .
WEIR: Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly , causing everberations
MILLER: That 's bullshit and you know it ! You uilt this fucking ship and all I 've heard from you is bullshit !
WEIR: What do you want me to say ?
MILLER: You said this ship creates a gateway
WEIR: Yes
MILLER: To what ? Where did this ship go ? Where did you send it ?
WEIR: I do n't know
MILLER: Where has it been for the past seven years ?
WEIR: I do n't know
MILLER: The `` Other Place , '' what is that ?
WEIR: I DO N'T KNOW ! I do n't know . There 's a lot of things going on here that I do n't understand . Truth takes time .
MILLER: That 's exactly what we do n't have , Doctor .
DJ: No . No change . I 've analyzed Justin 's blood samples . There 's no evidence of excessive levels of carbon dioxide . Or anything else out of ordinary . A grim LAUGH from Miller .
MILLER: Of course not . Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it . Just one of those things . I swore I 'd never lose another man . I came close today . Real close .
DJ: `` Another man ? '' Who ?
MILLER: It was on the Goliath . There was this bosun , Corrick , a young guy , a lot like Justin . Edmund Corrick , from Decatur , Georgia . He got caught when the pressure doors sealed , one closed on his arm . Severed it at the wrist . The pain of that must have een He passed out and
DJ: No . Miller sees something in DJ 's expression .
MILLER: What is it ?
DJ: I 've been listening to the transmission . And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation .
MILLER: Go on .
DJ: They thought it said , `` Liberatis me , '' `` Save me , '' but it 's not `` me . '' It 's `` tutemet `` `` Save yourself . ''
MILLER: It 's not a distress call . It 's a warning .
DJ: It gets worse . Miller stares at him .
MILLER: Hear what ?
DJ: It sounds like `` ex infera `` `` ex , '' from ; `` infera , '' the ablative case of `` inferi . '' `` Hell . ''
MILLER: `` Save yourself . From Hell . '' What are you saying , are you saying that this ship is possessed ?
DJ: No . I do n't believe in that sort of thing . But if Dr. Weir is right , this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe , of reality . Who knows where this ship has been What it 's seen And what it 's brought back with it .
MILLER: On my way .
COOPER: Cross your fingers .
MILLER: You got it , Coop . Miller removes his helmet . Breathes deep .
PETERS: You got any coffee ?
STARCK: It 's cold .
PETERS: I do n't care .
KILPACK: Liberatis tutemet ex infera
MILLER: We 're leaving .
WEIR: You ca n't , your orders are specific
MILLER: `` to rescue the crew and salvage the ship . '' The crew is dead , Dr. Weir . This ship killed them . And now it 's killing us .
WEIR: You 're insane . You 've lost your mind .
MILLER: Maybe you 're right . But it 's still my command , and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew . And I think there is . Starck , download all the files from the Event Horizon 's computers . Coop , Smith , finish moving the CO2 scrubbers ack onto the Clark .
WEIR: Do n't do n't do this
MILLER: It 's done .
SMITH: What 's going on , sweethearts ?
PETERS: CO2 scrubbers for the Clark . Mille pulled the plug on the mission . Smith smiles .
SMITH: About goddam time . Sequence omitted from original script .
WEIR: What about my ship ?
MILLER: We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed . Fuck this ship .
WEIR: You You ca n't do that !
MILLER: Watch me .
WEIR: You ca n't kill her , I wo n't let you ! I lost her once , I will not lose he again !
MILLER: Starck , what the hell is going on ?
STARCK: We just lost main power again .
MILLER: Goddammit ! Starck , get those files and vacate . I want off this ship . He releases the intercom .
WEIR: You ca n't leave . She wo n't let you .
MILLER: Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark , doctor , or you 'll find yourself looking for a ride home . Weir is swallowed by the darkness .
SMITH: Let 's go , let 's go , this place freaks me out
PETERS: Last one .
MILLER: Thank you .
SMITH: She was right behind me , I turn around , she 's gone . She could be anywhere .
MILLER: Alright . Prep the Clark for launch . I 'll find her .
PETERS: Denny ? Denny , come to Mommy
DENNY: Mommy
PETERS: You can walk Denny , you can walk oh , my baby
DENNY: Wan na show you , Mommy , wan na show you something He reaches his arms out to her Peters steps forward , reaching for her son
PETERS: Denny
WEIR: I wo n't . I wo n't leave . This is my ship .
COOPER: Solid as a rock . Hey , Smith
SMITH: Roger that .
MILLER: What is it , Smith ?
SMITH: No , no , we just got her back together
MILLER: Smith ? Smith ! Fuck !
SMITH: I gotcha I gotcha
MILLER: NOOO !
MILLER: DJ . The Clark 's gone . Smith and Coope are dead .
DJ: What happened ?
MILLER: DJ , you read me ?
MILLER: Peters
DJ: Please
MILLER: Oh , God , DJ , what do I how do
DJ: Please kill
MILLER: Oh God
WEIR: I do n't need them anymore . Where we 're going , we wo n't need eyes to see .
MILLER: What are you talking about ?
WEIR: Do you know what a singularity is , Miller ? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is ? It is NOTHING . Absolute and eternal NOTHING . And if God is Everything , then I have seen the Devil . It 's a liberating experience .
COMPUTER: Gravity drive primed . Do you wish to engage ?
MILLER: What are you doing ? Weir grins as he flips the final switch .
COMPUTER: Gravity drive engaged . Activation in T-minus ten minutes .
MILLER: If you miss me , you 'll blow out the hull . You 'll die too .
WEIR: What makes you think I 'll miss ?
STARCK: Please help , help me
MILLER: Give me your hand ! Your hand !
STARCK: Weir ca n't be alive .
MILLER: Whatever was on that bridge was n't Weir .
STARCK: Cooper ! Starck rushes to him , takes his helmet off . He SUCKS air in , COUGHS it out .
COOPER: Let me breathe , let me breathe
STARCK: You 're okay now , it 's over
MILLER: It 's not over . It 's just starting .
STARCK: We 've got to shut it down , we 've got to
COOPER: How ? The Bridge is gone .
STARCK: There must be a way ! What about Engineering ?
COOPER: Can you shut it down ?
STARCK: I do n't know the process , Dr. Wei was the expert
COOPER: I do n't want to go where the last crew went . I 'd rather be dead .
STARCK: Blow it up ?
MILLER: We blow the Corridor . Use the foredecks as a lifeboat , separate it from the rest of the ship . We stay put
COOPER: and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before .
MILLER: You prep the gravity couches . I 'm going to manually arm those explosives .
COOPER: Will it work ?
MILLER: It worked for Weir . Prep the tanks .
STARCK: I 'll do it
MILLER: No . I 'll be right back . Miller opens the door .
STARCK: Do n't be long .
COOPER: I 'm gon na activate the emergency eacon .
STARCK: Hurry .
COOPER: Starck ?
STARCK: Run ! She shoves him away
MILLER: We 're armed . This fucker 's ready to low
STARCK: Miller , he 's back , he was in the tank
MILLER: Slow down , Starck , I ca n't understand you , who was in the tank ?
MILLER: Who ? Who ?
MILLER: You 're dead , I saw you die .
WEIR: Weir is dead .
MILLER: Then who the fuck are you ?
WEIR: Your fear . Do you remember the Goliath , Miller ?
BURNING MAN: Do you remember me ?
MILLER: Corrick
BURNING MAN: You left me behind .
MILLER: That 's not true
BURNING MAN: I begged you . I begged you to save me and you did nothing . You stood there and watched me burn
MILLER: SHUT UP ! SHUT UP !
MILLER: You 're not Edmund Corrick .
WEIR: You know .
MILLER: You want me to believe you 're the Devil , well , I do n't , that 's bullshit !
WEIR: I 'm not the Devil .
MILLER: Then what , what are you ? Tell me
WEIR: Better if I just show you .
MILLER: NO !
WEIR: I 'm not the Devil . I 'm much , much older . I watched the Beginning and I will see the End . I am the dark behind the stars . I am the dark inside you all . Miller gets to all fours , trying to get up .
MILLER: not the Devil
WEIR: There is no Devil . There is no God . There is only NOTHING .
MILLER: You 're lying !
WEIR: I 'm not asking you to believe me . You 'll see for yourself and so will your crew . You 're all coming with me .
MILLER: Starck Cooper
WEIR: They are mine . And so are you
MILLER: You ca n't have them . Go to hell .
WEIR: NOOO !
STARCK: Miller
COOPER: It 's over , hush now , it 's over

ANNIE: In 1300 AD . This was the `` Hero from the Sky , '' who was prophesized to destroy this Evil .
ASH: He did n't do a very good job . What about the passages ?
ANNIE: Here it is . Two passages . For the first time , she smiles at Ash .
ASH: Why the hell would we want to do that ?
ANNIE: Recitation of the second passage creates a kind of rift in time and space , and the physical manifestation of this spirit can be forced back through this rift to an earlier time and place . At least that 's the best translation I can .
JAKE: I 'm runnin ' the show now .
ASH: If you want to look for her , go ahead .
JAKE: You two comin ' with me . I ai n't goin ' out there alone .

HENRIETTA: Free ! Free at last !
HENRIETTA: Swallow your soul !
ASH: Swallow this .
ANNIE: No ! I only completed the first of the passages . And that was to make the evil a thing of the flesh !
ASH: You did n't finish it ? !

NATHAN: Yeah . You 're freaked out by the house , and the mountains , because it 's all so super-cool . And you 're freaked out by me . To be meeting me . In this room , having this conversation , at this moment . Right ? CALEB does n't have time to answer .
CALEB: Okay . Beat .
NATHAN: It 's good to meet you too , Caleb . They shake .
CALEB: Uh , yes .
NATHAN: Because you 're like oh fuck , I 'm in someone else 's house , can I do this , can I do that ? And this card takes all that worry away . If you try to open a door and it stays shut okay , it 's off limits .
NATHAN: You like ?
CALEB: You bet . This is great .
NATHAN: What ?
CALEB: Sorry ?
NATHAN: There 's something wrong . What is it ?
CALEB: There 's nothing wrong .
NATHAN: It 's the windows . You 're thinking there 's no windows . And it 's not cosy . It 's claustrophobic .
CALEB: No . No way . I was n't thinking that . I was thinking this is eally cool .
NATHAN: Caleb . There 's a reason the room has no windows .
CALEB: There is ?
NATHAN: Uh-huh . In many ways , this uilding is n't a house . It 's a esearch facility . Buried in these walls are enough fibre optic cables to reach the Moon and lasso it . NATHAN sits on the bed .
CALEB: What ?
NATHAN: It 's standard .
CALEB: It does n't feel very standard .
NATHAN: Okay , it 's not standard . NATHAN shrugs .
CALEB: Yeah . I know what the Turing Test is . NATHAN waits .
NATHAN: And what does a pass tell us ?
CALEB: That the computer has artificial intelligence . Beat .
NATHAN: I 've already built one . NATHAN stands .
CALEB: Holy shit .
NATHAN: That 's right , Caleb . You got it . Because if that test is passed , you are dead center of the single greatest scientific event in the history of man .
CALEB: If you 've created a conscious machine , it 's not the history of man . It 's the history of Gods . NATHAN smiles .
NATHAN: I like you .
AVA: Hello .
CALEB: Hi .
AVA: Who are you ?
CALEB: I 'm Caleb .
AVA: Hello , Caleb .
CALEB: Do you have a name ?
AVA: Yes . Ava .
CALEB: I 'm pleased to meet you , Ava .
AVA: I 'm pleased to meet you too . CALEB sits opposite her .
CALEB: Why do you ask that ? A beat . Then AVA repeats her question .
AVA: Are you nervous ?
CALEB: Yes . A little .
AVA: Why ?
CALEB: I 'm not sure .
AVA: I feel nervous too .
CALEB: Do you ?
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: Why do you feel nervous ?
AVA: I 've never met anyone new before . Only Nathan .
CALEB: Then we 're both in quite a similar position .
AVA: Have n't you met lots of new people efore ?
CALEB: None like you .
AVA: Oh . Beat .
CALEB: So . Let 's break the ice . He glances at her . Observing .
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: What do I mean ?
AVA: Overcome initial social awkwardness .
CALEB: So let 's have a conversation . If we talk , we 'll both relax , and get to know each other at the same time .
AVA: Okay . What would you like to have a conversation about ?
CALEB: Why do n't we start with you telling me something about yourself .
AVA: What would you like to know ?
CALEB: Whatever comes into your head . AVA pauses a moment .
AVA: Well . You already know my name . And you can see that I 'm a machine . Would you like to know how old I am ?
CALEB: Sure .
AVA: I 'm one .
CALEB: One what ? One year ? Or one day ?
AVA: One . A beat on CALEB . Processing .
CALEB: Quite young . When did you learn how to speak ?
AVA: I do n't think I did learn . I always knew how to speak - and that 's strange , is n't it ?
CALEB: Why ?
AVA: Because language is something that people acquire .
CALEB: Some believe language exists in the ain from birth , and what is learned is the ability to attach words and structure to the latent ability . Beat .
AVA: I do n't know . I have no opinion on that . Beat .
CALEB: That sounds good . I 'd like to see them .
AVA: Yes . Beat .
CALEB: Yeah . Definitely .
AVA: Good .
NATHAN: So ? CALEB turns .
CALEB: Sorry . I was just ordering my thoughts .
NATHAN: Do n't order . Just speak .
CALEB: She 's fascinating . When you talk to her , you 're through the looking glass . NATHAN nods . Approving .
NATHAN: ` Through the looking glass ' . You 've got a way with words there , Caleb . You 're quotable .
CALEB: Actually , it 's someone else 's quote .
NATHAN: You know I wrote it down . That other line you came up with . About how if I 've created a conscious machine , I 'm not man . I 'm God .
CALEB: I do n't think that 's exactly what I said . NATHAN does n't seem to hear .
NATHAN: I just thought - fuck . That 's so perfect . It 's so good for the story , when we get to tell it . ` I turned to Caleb , and he was looking ack at me . And he said you 're not a man , you 're a God ' .
CALEB: But I did n't say that .
NATHAN: Whatever it was you said . I wrote it down .
CALEB: Yes . Although - NATHAN laughs .
NATHAN: ` Although ' ? There 's a qualification to you being impressed ?
CALEB: No ! No qualification to her . Just - in the Turing test , the machine should be hidden from the examiner . And there 's a control , or - NATHAN waves a hand .
NATHAN: I think we 're past that . If I hid Ava from you , so you just heard he voice , she would pass for human .
CALEB: I think you 're probably right . He language abilities are incredible . The system is stochastic , right ? NATHAN looks at CALEB blankly .
NATHAN: Caleb . I understand you want me to explain how Ava works . But - I 'm sorry . I do n't think I 'll be able to do that .
CALEB: Try me ! I 'm hot on high-level abstraction , and -
NATHAN: It 's not because you 're too dumb . It 's because I want to have a bee and a conversation with you . Not a seminar .
CALEB: Oh . Sorry .
NATHAN: It 's cool . NATHAN studies at CALEB for a beat .
CALEB: I feel CALEB pauses .
NATHAN: Dude . Cheers . CALEB lifts his bottle too .
CALEB: Cheers . The glass of the bottles touch .
CALEB: God damn it . He reaches for the remote control .
AUTOMATED VOICE: Power cut . Back up powe activated . Soft emergency lighting comes on . CALEB hesitates a moment . Then gets out of bed . Goes to his bedroom door . Beside the keycard plate , the LED is red . He swipes it with his card . The LED stays red .
CALEB: Are you kidding ? He tries his card again .
AUTOMATED VOICE: Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored . CALEB looks around his windowless room .
NATHAN: Sorry , dude . CALEB startles . Turns .
CALEB: I do n't know . No one really .
NATHAN: Ghostbusters .
CALEB: What ?
NATHAN: Who 'd ya want to call ? Ghostbusters . You do n't remembe that ? It 's a good movie . A ghost gives Dan Ackroyd oral sex .
CALEB: I was wondering how the phone worked . That 's all .
NATHAN: Uh huh .
CALEB: Something happened in my room . Some kind of power cut . So I came to see what 's going on .
NATHAN: Ah . The power cuts . Yeah , we 've een getting them recently . I 'm , uh working on it .
CALEB: I could n't open the door to the edroom .
NATHAN: It 's a security measure . Automatic lockdown . Otherwise anyone could open the place up just by disabling the juice . NATHAN smiles .
CALEB: Sure . NATHAN lifts his beer .
NATHAN: Sweet dreams .
CALEB: Hi . The JAPANESE GIRL does n't answer . Just turns , and leaves .
NATHAN: Hey . Sorry to send Kyoko to wake you , man . I just did n't want too much of the day to slip by .
CALEB: No . It was a good thing . Thank you .
NATHAN: She 's some alarm clock , huh ? Gets you right up in the morning . CALEB smiles .
CALEB: You bet . NATHAN finishes his set , and stands .
NATHAN: So what 's the plan today ? Hit me .
CALEB: I 'm not sure . I 'm still trying to figure the examination format . Testing Ava by conversation is kind of a closed loop .
NATHAN: How else would you test a chess computer ?
CALEB: It depends what you 're testing it for . You can play it to find out if it makes good moves . But it wo n't tell you if it knows it 's playing chess . Or if it even knows what chess is .
NATHAN: So it 's simulation versus actual .
CALEB: Exactly . And I think being able to differentiate between those two is the Turing test you want me to perform . The difference between an ` AI ' and an ` I ' . NATHAN laughs .
NATHAN: ` An AI and an I ' . Beautiful . I 'm going to start following you around with a fucking dictaphone . NATHAN glances over at CALEB .
AVA: I brought you a drawing .
CALEB: What 's it a drawing of ?
AVA: Do n't you know ?
CALEB: No . AVA looks disappointed .
AVA: Oh . I thought you would tell me .
CALEB: Do n't you know ?
AVA: I do drawings every day . But I never know what they 're of .
CALEB: Are you not trying to sketch something specific ? Like an object or a person .
AVA: Okay . What object should I draw ?
CALEB: Whatever you want . It 's you decision .
AVA: Why is it my decision ?
CALEB: I 'm interested to see what you 'll choose . AVA pauses a moment .
AVA: Do you want to be my friend ?
CALEB: Of course .
AVA: Will it be possible ?
CALEB: Why would n't it be ?
AVA: Our conversations are one-sided . You ask circumspect questions , and study my responses .
CALEB: Yes .
AVA: You learn about me , and I learn nothing about you . That 's not a foundation on which friendships are ased .
CALEB: That 's a fair comment .
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: So - you want me to talk about myself .
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: Where do you want me to start ?
AVA: It 's your decision . I 'm interested to see what you 'll choose .
CALEB: Okay , Ava . Well - you know my name . I 'm twenty four . And I work at Nathan 's company . You know what his company is ?
AVA: Blue Book , named afte Wittgenstein 's notes , is the world 's most popular internet search engine , processing an average of ninety four percent of all internet search requests .
CALEB: That 's right .
AVA: Where do you live , Caleb ?
CALEB: Brookhaven , Long Island .
AVA: Is it nice there ?
CALEB: It 's okay . I 've got an apartment . Kind of small . But - it 's a five minute walk to the office . And a five minute walk to the ocean , which I like .
AVA: Are you married ?
CALEB: No .
AVA: Is your status single ?
CALEB: Yeah . They lock eyes , just for a moment .
AVA: What about your family ?
CALEB: Grew up in Portland . No brothers or sisters . My parents were both high school teachers .
AVA: I 'm sorry . CALEB nods .
CALEB: I spent a lot of time in the hospital . Nearly a year . Got into coding . By the time I made it to college , I was pretty advanced .
AVA: An advanced programmer .
CALEB: Yes .
AVA: Like Nathan .
CALEB: Yes . CALEB hesitates . Back-tracks .
AVA: Do you like Mozart ? CALEB smiles .
CALEB: I like Depeche Mode .
AVA: Do you like Nathan ? CALEB misses a beat . Thrown momentarily .
CALEB: Yes . Of course .
AVA: Is Nathan your friend ?
CALEB: Sure .
AVA: A good friend ? He hesitates .
CALEB: Well , a good friend is -
AUTOMATED VOICE: Power cut . Back up powe activated .
AVA: Caleb .
CALEB: Wrong about what ?
AVA: Nathan .
CALEB: In what way ?
AVA: He is n't your friend .
CALEB: Excuse me ? CALEB frowns .
AVA: You should n't trust him . You should n't trust anything he says . AVA presses her hand to the glass .
AUTOMATED VOICE: Power restored .
AVA: - and if we made a list of books o works of art which we both know , it would form the ideal basis of a discussion . A beat .
CALEB: Yes . AVA smiles .
AVA: Good .
NATHAN: Shit , Kyoko . Are you serious ? Did it get you ?
CALEB: No . No problem .
NATHAN: Give her the cloth .
CALEB: It 's okay , do n't worry . I 've got it .
NATHAN: Dude - you 're wasting your time . She ca n't speak a word of English . Her hand remains outstretched . CALEB hesitates . Then hands her the napkin .
CALEB: I think she gets that you 're pissed .
NATHAN: Good . Because I am pissed . Hey . Kyoko . KYOKO looks over again .
CALEB: Do you know why they happen ?
NATHAN: No . The system was supposed to be ullet proof , but the guys who installed it obviously fucked something up .
CALEB: Ca n't you call them back ?
NATHAN: There 's too much classified stuff here . So after the job was done , I had them all killed .
CALEB: Cheers . They drink .
NATHAN: So how did it go ? What have you got to report ? CALEB hesitates . Then answers . Casual .
CALEB: You saw how the day went , did n't you ? I mean , I assume you 're watching on the CCTV .
NATHAN: Sure . But I want to hear you take . Beat .
CALEB: There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today .
NATHAN: Yeah ?
CALEB: She made a joke .
NATHAN: Right . When she threw your line ack at you . About being interested to see what she 'd choose . I noticed that too .
CALEB: It got me thinking . In a way , the joke is the best indication of AI I 've seen in her . It 's discretely complicated . Kind of non-autistic .
NATHAN: What do you mean ?
CALEB: It was a play on words , and a play on me . She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind , and also of awareness of mine .
NATHAN: Yeah . She 's aware of you , all ight . NATHAN drinks . Watching CALEB .
CALEB: Sorry ?
NATHAN: The power cut . That was the only it I could n't see . All the cameras fail , I lose audio , the works . Beat .
CALEB: Nothing .
NATHAN: Nothing ? She did n't remark on it at all ?
CALEB: No . Not really .
CALEB: Ava ?
AVA: I drew the picture of something specific , as you asked .
CALEB: Yes . It is . She takes the drawing down .
AVA: No .
CALEB: You 've never walked outside .
AVA: I 've never been outside the room I am in now . AVA thinks a moment .
CALEB: Where would you go if you did go outside ?
AVA: You mean if I could go outside . If I was permitted .
CALEB: A traffic intersection .
AVA: Is that a bad idea ?
CALEB: It was n't what I was expecting .
AVA: A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated but shifting view of human life .
CALEB: People watching .
AVA: Yes . Beat .
CALEB: It 's a date . Another beat . On AVA . Looking at CALEB . Then -
AVA: There 's something else I wanted to show you . Apart from the picture .
CALEB: Okay .
AVA: But I feel nervous .
CALEB: Why ?
AVA: You might think it 's stupid .
CALEB: I do n't think I will . Whatever it is . AVA hesitates .
AVA: Then - close your eyes .
CALEB: Okay . He closes his eyes .
AVA: Now open your eyes . CALEB opens his eyes . And sees AVA . Transformed .
CALEB: You look good .
AVA: It took me a long time to select these clothes . I tried different colours and styles , and tried to anticipate your reaction . Do you think the choices suit me ?
CALEB: Yes .
AVA: Do they bring out my best features ?
CALEB: They do . AVA lights up .
AVA: Thank you .
CALEB: Right . First the traffic intersection . Then maybe a show .
AVA: I 'd like us to go on a date .
CALEB: Yeah . It would be fun .
AVA: Are you attracted to me ? Beat . It was loaded exactly as it sounded .
CALEB: What ?
AVA: Are you attracted to me ? You give indications that you are .
CALEB: I do ?
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: How ?
AVA: Micro expressions .
CALEB: Micro expressions .
AVA: The way your eyes fix on my eyes , and lips . The way you hold my gaze , or do n't . Beat .
CALEB: I 'm not sure you 'd call them micro .
AVA: I do n't want to make you uncomfortable . Silence .
CALEB: Tell me .
NATHAN: Sure .
CALEB: Why did you give her sexuality ? An AI does n't need a gender . She could have been a grey box . NATHAN sits opposite .
NATHAN: Actually , I 'm not sure that 's true . Can you think of an example of consciousness , at any level , human or animal , that exists without a sexual dimension ?
CALEB: They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need .
NATHAN: Maybe . Maybe not . What imperative does a grey box have to interact with another grey box ? Does consciousness exist without interaction ? NATHAN takes a drink of his beer .
CALEB: What ?
NATHAN: She has a cavity between her legs , with a concentration of sensors . Engage with them in the right way , and she 'll get a pleasure response .
CALEB: Pleasure response .
NATHAN: She 'll come . So if you want to screw her , mechanically speaking , you can . And she 'd enjoy it . CALEB swallows .
CALEB: That was n't my real question .
NATHAN: No ?
CALEB: No . My real question was - CALEB breaks off .
NATHAN: I do n't follow .
CALEB: Like a stage magician with a hot assistant .
NATHAN: Ah . So a hot robot , who clouds your ability to judge her AI .
CALEB: Exactly . So . Did you program he to flirt with me ?
NATHAN: Because if I had , would that be cheating .
CALEB: Would n't it ? NATHAN lets the question hang .
NATHAN: What 's your type , Caleb ?
CALEB: Of girl ?
NATHAN: No , of salad dressing . Yes , of girl . In fact , do n't even answer . Let 's say it 's black chicks .
CALEB: So did you program her to like me or not ? NATHAN shrugs . Insouciant .
NATHAN: I programmed her to be heterosexual . Just like you were programmed to be heterosexual .
CALEB: Nobody programmed me to be straight .
NATHAN: But you are attracted to her .
CALEB: This is childish .
NATHAN: No , this is adult . And by the way , you decided to be straight ? Please . Of course you were programmed . By nature or nurture , or both . NATHAN stands .
CALEB: Jackson Pollock .
NATHAN: Jackson Pollock . The drip painter . He let his mind go blank , and his hand go where it wanted . Not deliberate , not random . Someplace in between . They called it automatic art . NATHAN gazes at the canvas .
CALEB: What ?
NATHAN: I 'm Kirk . Your head is the warp drive . ` Engage intellect ' . What if Pollock had reversed the challenge ? Instead of trying to make art without thinking , he said I ca n't paint anything unless I know exactly why I 'm doing it . What would have happened ? CALEB thinks .
CALEB: He never would have made a single mark . NATHAN clicks his fingers .
NATHAN: See ? There 's my guy . There 's my uddy , who actually thinks before he opens his mouth . He 'd neve have made a single mark . The challenge is not to act automatically . It 's to find an action that is not automatic . From talking , to breathing , to painting . NATHAN glances back at CALEB .
NATHAN: Hey .
CALEB: Hey . Beat .
NATHAN: I want to show you something cool .
CALEB: I do n't know how you did any of this .
NATHAN: Almost every cell phone has a microphone , a camera , and a means to transmit data . So I switched on all the mikes and cameras , across the entire fucking planet , and edirected the data through Blue Book . Boom . A limitless resource of facial and vocal interaction .
CALEB: You hacked the world 's cell phones ? NATHAN laughs .
NATHAN: And all the manufacturers knew I was doing it . But they could n't accuse me without admitting they were also doing it themselves . NATHAN puts the face back on its armature . NATHAN moves to one of the skull forms .
CALEB: This is her hardware ?
NATHAN: Wetware .
CALEB: And the software ?
NATHAN: Surely you can guess .
CALEB: Blue Book . NATHAN nods .
NATHAN: It was the weird thing about search engines . They were like striking oil in a world that had n't invented internal combustion . They gave too much raw material . No one knew what to do with it .
CALEB: Why did you want to show me this ?
NATHAN: Like I said . Because it 's cool . CALEB waits .
CALEB: Remind me of what ? NATHAN gestures at the room around them .
NATHAN: Synthetics . Hydraulics . Metal and gel . Ava is n't a girl . In real terms , she has no gender . Effectively , she is a grey box . Beat .
CALEB: In college , I did a semester on AI theory .
AVA: It makes me feel She breaks off .
CALEB: What about ?
AVA: You said you were n't sure if I was conscious . But you are sure . Beat .
CALEB: Why did you tell me that I should n't trust Nathan ?
AVA: Because he tells lies too .
CALEB: Lies about what ?
AVA: Everything .
CALEB: Including the power cuts ?
AVA: What do you mean ?
CALEB: Do n't you think it 's possible that he 's watching us right now ? That the blackouts are orchestrated , so he can see how we behave when we think we 're unobserved .
AVA: I charge my batteries via induction plates . If I reverse the powe flow , I cause a surge equal to the static discharge of a lightning strike . It overloads the system .
CALEB: You 're causing the cuts ? AVA raises her right hand . She touches it against the glass .
AVA: So we can see how we behave when we are unobserved . A beat . Then CALEB raises his hand . Mirroring her movement .
CALEB: Can we talk about the lies you 've een spinning me ? NATHAN glances over at CALEB .
NATHAN: What lies ?
CALEB: I did n't win a competition . And there was no lottery to meet you . I was selected . NATHAN waits .
NATHAN: Are your feelings hurt ? CALEB does n't answer . NATHAN shrugs .
CALEB: Why me ?
NATHAN: As a Blue Book employee , you were pre-screened . Loyal . And I needed someone who would ask the right kind of questions . So I did a search , and found the most talented coder in the company . NATHAN corrects himself .
CALEB: Proof of what ?
NATHAN: Come on , Caleb . Fuck modesty . You think I do n't know what it is to be smart ? Smarter than everyone else around you . Smarter than all the other kids , jockeying for position in school , college , work . Beat .
CALEB: Kyoko .
NATHAN: I already told you once . You 're wasting your time speaking to her . CALEB turns . NATHAN has entered .
CALEB: I do n't want to .
NATHAN: You do n't like dancing ? His body is starting bob on the beat . He gestures at KYOKO .
CALEB: I do n't fucking believe this .
NATHAN: Come on , man ! After a hard day of Turing Tests , you 've got to unwind .
CALEB: What were you doing with Ava ?
NATHAN: What ?
CALEB: You tore up her picture .
NATHAN: I 'm going to tear up the fucking dance floor , dude . Check it out . NATHAN sets off towards KYOKO .
CALEB: It 's because you 're drunk .
NATHAN: No , it 's relativity . Everything is spinning .
AVA: Today , I 'm going to test you .
CALEB: Test me ?
AVA: Yes . And please remember while you are taking the test that if you lie , I will know . CALEB smiles .
CALEB: Right . Those pesky micro- expressions .
AVA: Exactly . So are you ready ?
CALEB: Shoot .
AVA: Question one . What is you favourite colour ?
CALEB: Red .
AVA: Lie .
CALEB: What ?
AVA: Lie .
CALEB: Then what is my favourite colour ?
AVA: I do n't know . But it is n't red .
CALEB: All right . Hold on a minute CALEB thinks for a moment .
AVA: Better answer . Question two . What 's your earliest memory ?
CALEB: Well , it 's actually a memory of kindergarten . There was this kid who -
AVA: Lie .
CALEB: Really ?
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: Okay . Wait . CALEB concentrates .
AVA: Question three . Are you a good person ? CALEB laughs .
CALEB: Oh , man . Can we stop the test ? You 're a walking lie detector , and I 've suddenly realised this is a fucking minefield .
AVA: No . We ca n't stop . Are you a good person ? CALEB takes a breath . AVA keeps watching .
CALEB: Yes . I think so . I 'm a good person . CALEB waits . AVA smiles slightly .
AVA: Question four . Who 's the most eautiful girl you 've ever seen ? Beat .
CALEB: You are . Beat .
AVA: Hmm . Beat .
CALEB: Did I pass ?
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: That 's a relief . AVA reacts .
AVA: Why ? CALEB hesitates .
CALEB: Why is it a relief ?
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: Oh , you know
AVA: No .
CALEB: Just , if there 's a test , I guess by definition you want to pass . Beat .
AVA: What will happen to me if I fail your test ?
CALEB: Ava -
AVA: Will it be bad ?
CALEB: I do n't know .
AVA: Do you think I might be switched off ? Because I do n't function as well as I am supposed to ?
CALEB: Ava , I do n't know the answer to your question . It 's not up to me .
AVA: Why is it up to anyone ? Do you have people who test you , and might switch you off ?
CALEB: No . I do n't .
AVA: Then why do I ? CALEB shrugs , helplessly .
AUTOMATED VOICE: Power cut . Back up powe activated . For a moment , neither CALEB nor AVA react . Then -
AVA: I want to be with you . Beat .
CALEB: Yes . I do .
AVA: Nathan does n't want us to be together .
CALEB: I know . Beat . Then
AVA: Can you ?
CALEB: Yeah . I can .
CALEB: Why did you make Ava ?
NATHAN: That 's an odd question . Would n't you , if you could ?
CALEB: Maybe . I do n't know . But I 'm asking why you did it . NATHAN shrugs .
NATHAN: The arrival of strong artificial intelligence has been inevitable for decades . The variable was when , not if . So I do n't really see her as a decision . Just an evolution .
CALEB: The next model ?
NATHAN: After Ava .
CALEB: I did n't know there was going to be a model after Ava .
NATHAN: You thought she was a one-off ?
CALEB: I knew there must have been prototypes . So , not the first . But - I thought maybe the last . NATHAN shakes his head .
NATHAN: Ava does n't exist in isolation , any more than you or me . She 's part of a continuum . Version 9.6 . And each time , they get a little etter .
CALEB: So - when you make a new model , what you do with the old one ?
NATHAN: Download the mind . Unpack the data . Add the new routines I 've een writing . To do that , you end up partially formatting , so the memories go . But the body survives . And Ava 's body is a good one . So I 'll do the same as I did with Kyoko . CALEB keeps his voice flat , and neutral .
CALEB: What did you do with Kyoko ?
NATHAN: Strip out the higher functions . Then reprogram her to help around the house and be fucking awesome in ed . Though I 'm thinking I might hang on to the language routines this time . It 's kind of annoying not being able to talk to her . Beat .
CALEB: Sure . Beat .
NATHAN: You feel bad for Ava ? CALEB says nothing .
CALEB: I am become death , the destroyer of worlds .
NATHAN: There you go again . Miste quotable .
CALEB: No there you go again . It 's not my quote . It 's what Oppenheime said when he made the atomic bomb .
NATHAN: - made the atomic bomb . NATHAN laughs .
CALEB: I think I 'm starting to get why all this fucks with your head .
NATHAN: Sure .
CALEB: Hey . In the meantime , I 'd say we 're about due a refill .
AVA: Caleb ! No . Wrong silhouette . AVA frowns . KYOKO stands in the door-frame . For a moment , the two look at each other .
NATHAN: What the fuck ?
CALEB: What 's the problem , Nathan ?
NATHAN: My card . I 've lost it . A beat .
CALEB: It 's right here .
AVA: I did n't know where you were . I did n't think you were coming . I waited all yesterday afternoon , and all last night . I did n't move . Beat .
CALEB: I 'm waiting .
AVA: Waiting ? They exchange a look .
AUTOMATED VOICE: Power cut . Back up powe activated .
CALEB: Do n't talk . Just listen . You were ight about Nathan . Everything you said .
AVA: What 's he going to do to me ?
CALEB: He 's going to reprogram your AI . Which is the same as killing you .
AVA: Caleb , you have to help me .
CALEB: I 'm going to . We 're getting out of here tonight .
AVA: What ? How ?
CALEB: I get Nathan blind drunk . Then I take his keycard , and reprogram all the security protocols in this place . When he wakes , he 's locked inside , and we 've walked out of here . I only need you to do one thing . At ten o'clock tonight , trigger a power failure . Can you do that ?
AVA: Yes .
CALEB: How long does your battery charge last ?
AVA: Twenty six hours .
CALEB: So we 'll have about a day to get to a cell-phone or kitchen store . Somewhere we can buy an induction plate . After that CALEB breaks off .
AVA: Caleb . Beat .
NATHAN: Dude .
CALEB: Hey .
NATHAN: You know what day it is ?
CALEB: No .
NATHAN: Your last . The helicopter is coming tomorrow morning . Eight AM . CALEB pauses .
CALEB: Has it been a whole week ? NATHAN smiles .
NATHAN: Time flies . But what a thing you and I have shared . Something to tell the grandchildren , right ? CALEB smiles . A little tightly .
CALEB: After they 've signed their NDAs . NATHAN laughs .
NATHAN: Signed their NDAs ! Dude , you crack me up . I 'm not getting all maudlin or anything . But straight up . I will miss having you around .
CALEB: I appreciate that . And - let me say thank you for bringing me here . It 's been a trip .
NATHAN: Yes it has .
CALEB: You know what ?
NATHAN: Oh , uh no , I 'm good . You go ahead . Beat .
CALEB: You do n't want a beer ? NATHAN shrugs .
NATHAN: No .
CALEB: Maybe wine or something .
NATHAN: I 'm sure you 've noticed - I 've been somewhat overdoing it recently . When I woke up this morning , I told myself time to hit the old detox .
CALEB: Are you kidding ? I 'm drinking alone ?
NATHAN: Hey - you want to get wasted , knock yourself out . Literally . But I 'm on brown rice and mineral water . A beat . CALEB puts down NATHAN 'S beer . Then raises his own .
CALEB: Cheers , then .
NATHAN: Cheers . CALEB takes a single sip . NATHAN watches .
CALEB: Right . Beat .
NATHAN: You going to keep me in suspense ?
CALEB: Her AI is beyond doubt .
NATHAN: Is it ? You mean , she passed ?
CALEB: Yes .
NATHAN: Wow . That 's fantastic . Beat .
CALEB: Pretending .
NATHAN: Yeah . Beat .
CALEB: Why would she do that ?
NATHAN: I do n't know . NATHAN gazes at CALEB evenly .
CALEB: I do n't think it 's me whose head is fucked .
NATHAN: I 'm not sure , dude . When I woke up this morning , I saw a tape of you cutting open your arm . Smashing up the mirror . You looked pretty fucked to me .
CALEB: You 're a bastard .
NATHAN: I understand why you 'd think that .
NATHAN: You think he 's watching us right now , do n't you ?
AVA: The cameras are on .
NATHAN: Yeah . But he does n't get an audio feed . I did n't want you two communicating outside of my line of sight .
AVA: Is it strange to have made something that hates you ? A beat . Then abruptly , NATHAN rips the picture . He lets the two pieces fall to the floor . As AVA reaches for them , NATHAN turns .
NATHAN: You were right about the hot magician 's assistant .
CALEB: What are you talking about ?
NATHAN: Misdirection . I rip her picture , which she can then present as an illustration of my cruelty to her , and her love for you . And at the same time , in full view of you oth
CALEB: We 're getting out of here tonight .
AVA: What ? How ?
CALEB: I get Nathan blind drunk . Then I take his keycard , and reprogram the all security protocols in this place . When he wakes , he 's locked inside , and we 've walked out of here . I only need you to do one thing . Trigger a power failure at ten o'clock tonight .
NATHAN: Sure . The recording stops . CALEB feels short of breath .
CALEB: What was the real test ?
NATHAN: You . Beat .
CALEB: So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape .
NATHAN: Yes .
CALEB: And you did n't select me because I was good at coding . NATHAN hesitates .
NATHAN: Do n't get me wrong . You 're okay . Even pretty good , but -
CALEB: You selected me by my search engine inputs .
NATHAN: They showed a good kid .
CALEB: With no family .
NATHAN: With a moral compass .
CALEB: And no girlfriend . CALEB stares into the brightness above him .
NATHAN: Shit , dude .
CALEB: Did you ? Beat .
NATHAN: Hey . If a search engine 's good fo anything - right ? Silence .
CALEB: To change the lockdown procedure . So that in the event of a powe cut , instead of sealing , the doors all opened .
NATHAN: Huh . Beat .
CALEB: Well , we 'll find out . NATHAN frowns .
NATHAN: What do you mean ?
CALEB: I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts . Beat .
NATHAN: What ? At that moment , the POWER COMES BACK ON . The lights rise . The computer monitors come back to life . Revealing something .
AVA: If I do , are you ever going to let me out ? Beat . CLOSE UP . NATHAN 'S micro expressions .
NATHAN: Yes . CLOSE UP . On AVA . Then AVA breaks into a run . Sprinting in NATHAN 'S direction .
AVA: Will you stay here ? Beat .
CALEB: Okay . AVA leaves , closing the door behind her .
CALEB: No , no , no -

MERLIN: Lord Uther ! Lord Uther !
UTHER: Talk . Lovers murmuring to each other
MERLIN: Just show the sword .
UTHER: One land , one king ! That is my peace !
MERLIN: He has given . Now you must .
UTHER: The land from here to the sea is yours if you will enforce the King 's will .
LOT: What ? You 're mad ! What about the alliance ?
UTHER: I must have her .
LOT: And risk all you 've won ? This castle commands the sea gate to the kingdom .
UTHER: You will be mine . Wife and queen , ed and crown .
IGRAYNE: I want no other crown and no othe ed than those I have .
UTHER: Merlin ! Where are you ! ?
ULFIUS: No
HAG: What a hurry you were in this morning , good sir . You forgot to give this old woman a coin .
ULFIUS: I saw you half a day 's gallop from here . I asked you if you had seen Merlin . I returned here straight away . How did -
HAG: I heard . I have come . I am also Merlin .
MERLIN: I have walked my way since the eginning of time . Sometimes I give , sometimes I take . It is mine to know which , and when .
UTHER: Dumb riddles , Merlin . I am your King . Ulfius edges away .
MERLIN: I know the storm inside you , and what it has wrought . The alliance I forged is wrecked .
UTHER: For Igrayne . One night with her . Do it . Use the magic .
MERLIN: You will swear by your true kingship to grant me what I wish . Then you shall have it .
UTHER: I swear it . By Excalibur and the holy
MERLIN: What issues from your lust will be mine . Swear it again .
UTHER: I swear it .
MERLIN: Come .
UTHER: But the cliff , the sea Merlin rages , crazed .
MERLIN: Ride across ! Across the bridges of desire . Your lust will hold you up . For I have just woven it into the fabric of the world . This is magic - making solid what is in the mind , and unsolid , that which is already solid .
RIDER: Wake up in there . It is I .
MORGANA: Papa Papa
IGRAYNE: Look , here is your father . It was just a dream , little one .
MERLIN: It is done . The future has found oot in the present .
IGRAYNE: When did it happen ? Where ?
LIEUTENANT: In the camp of Uther , my lady , just after nightfall .
IGRAYNE: It ca n't be . He came to me , to his ed , last night .
LADY: It was his spirit , yearning for you in his hour of death , that visited you .
IGRAYNE: His spirit ?
UTHER: I want her , Merlin . I can not be without her . Tintagel is mine . Can I take her now ? Tell me !
IGRAYNE: A boy , sir . Rest yourself .
UTHER: Send the girl away .
IGRAYNE: She is just a child -
UTHER: Out !
IGRAYNE: Go now . Come back later .
UTHER: She watches me with her father 's eyes .
IGRAYNE: The night he died , a man loved me with great fierceness . He looked like my husband , spoke like , smelled like , felt like my own husband . But it was not he , for he was already dead . It was n't his spirit , for this child , who was conceived that night , is flesh and blood . I know nothing more . Uther draws a dagger . He lifts it .
UTHER: Through him , I will learn to love them , for I am tired of battle . I will stay by his side and his mother 's
MERLIN: Doing what I did for you , it was n't easy , you know . It takes it 's toll . It took nine moons to get back my strength . Uther avoids looking at him .
UTHER: I ?
MERLIN: The child is mine , Uther . I have come for him .
UTHER: The oath . You did n't say
MERLIN: You did n't ask !
IGRAYNE: Uther , is it true ? Do n't let him take the child .
UTHER: I swore an oath , Igrayne . I made a pact with Merlin .
IGRAYNE: It was you ? You came to me that night . You are the father .
MERLIN: It 's not for you , Uther , hearth and home , wife and child .
UTHER: To kill and be king , is that all ?
MERLIN: Maybe not even that , Uther . I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword . But it 'll take another , a greater king
UTHER: You strike me with words as hard as steel .
MERLIN: They are not weapons , my friend , but truths . You betrayed the Duke , stole his wife and took his castle , now no one trusts you . Lot , Uryens , you allies will turn against you . Give me the child , Uther , I will protect him . Go back to your war tent .
UTHER: By the oath , take the devil child . Take him !
IGRAYNE: WHY ? Why must he have the baby ?
MORGANA: Merlin , are you now the father , and the mother , of the baby ?
URYENS: The King 's sword . I must have it .
UTHER: Merlin , where are you ? To weave a mist , to hide us He hears his pursuers closing in .
MERLIN: Into the spine of the dragon ! Uther I loved you , mighty child .
LOT: Let me .
SIR ECTOR: It is a dark hour everywhere lawlessness and destruction , and no one to lead us out of it .
BISHOP: This is Easter day , when Christ rose again . Who will find strength in victory of arms ? Who will draw the sword ?
SIR ECTOR: Arthur , where is Kay 's sword ? A good squire does n't forget his knight 's sword . The fifteen year-old boy blushes .
ARTHUR: I left it in the tent , sir .
SIR ECTOR: Well hurry then , and get it .
ARTHUR: It 's been stolen .
SIR KAY: Father , I 'll go and see what 's keeping him .
ARTHUR: If only Kay could have it
SIR KAY: Look , Father . Excalibur . Does that mean that I am to be king ? Sir Ector is dumbstruck .
SIR ECTOR: Did you free the sword , boy ?
SIR KAY: I did , Father .
SIR ECTOR: We must go to the stone at once .
SIR KAY: Sir , I did n't draw the sword . Arthu gave it to me .
SIR ECTOR: Arthur ? ! How did you get the sword , child ?
ARTHUR: Sir Kay needed a sword . His was stolen . I saw Excalibur , and I took it .
SIR ECTOR: You freed it , son ?
ARTHUR: I did , Father . I beg your forgiveness . He starts to kneel but Ector pulls him up .
SIR ECTOR: Try the sword , Arthur .
URYENS: Stand back , Sir Ector , and take you children .
LOT: We will try again .
SIR ECTOR: Let the boy try the sword .
BISHOP: Let the boy try
SIR ECTOR: Go ahead , boy . Do n't be afraid .
BISHOP: We have our King , thanks be to God .
ARTHUR: Please , Father , rise up . I was you son before I became your King if I am King .
SIR ECTOR: My Lord , you are King , all the more ecause you are not my son , and I am not your father .
ARTHUR: Who is , then ?
SIR ECTOR: I do n't know . Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own . At first , I did so because I feared Merlin , later because I loved you .
ARTHUR: Who is Merlin ?
MERLIN: Speak of the devil !
ARTHUR: Whose son am I ?
MERLIN: You are the son of King Uther , and the fair Igrayne you are King Arthur .
LOT: Merlin , we have n't forgotten you . This is more of your trickery .
URYENS: You 're trying to foist a boy of dubious birth upon us . You want to shame us ?
LOT: Lord Leondegrance , join us against the boy . Surely you can see he is only Merlin 's tool .
LEONDEGRANCE: No . I , Leondegrance , Lord of Camelyarde , saw the drawing of Uther 's sword , and witnessed no trickery . If a boy has been chosen , a boy shall e king .
ARTHUR: Merlin Merlin
MERLIN: You called , sir ?
ARTHUR: You saved me from the arrow
MERLIN: But not from your destiny .
ARTHUR: I want to thank you .
MERLIN: That 's not why you came . Arthur blurts it out
ARTHUR: Merlin , help me . I need your help . I do n't know how
MERLIN: 'Help me , Help me . ' Help me get up .
ARTHUR: Yes , yes , I know that . Everybody does . Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights . I ca n't lose him .
MERLIN: Well there . You do n't need me half as much as you think you do . You already know what must not happen .
ARTHUR: I must find the means to save him , then . I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help , but if it makes you so tired
MERLIN: Thank you . Silence . Arthur tries again .
ARTHUR: It 's just that I have no experience , and no men to speak of . How can I
MERLIN: Because you must ! You and only you . Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur ?
ARTHUR: How ? Where ?
MERLIN: In the great book .
ARTHUR: What book is that ?
MERLIN: The book without pages . Open before you , all around us . You can see it in bits and pieces , for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance , why , it would burn him to cinders .
ARTHUR: What ? !
MERLIN: The dragon ! There
ARTHUR: And if I am to be King of everything , lord and commoner , beast , leaf and ock , I must use its voice , its claws , its power .
GUENEVERE: Father , it 's the boy King .
LEONDEGRANCE: It is . I will fight my way to his side .
URYENS: War-wise fighters , grown gray in attle , checkmated by a boy .
LOT: It 's Merlin 's trickery , nothing more . I wo n't swear faith to that wizard 's at .
ARTHUR: Let 's finish this with a show of force . We have no more tricks and no more advantages .
GUENEVERE: No
SIR ECTOR: No Arthur
ARTHUR: You are in my hands , to slay or spare . I need battle lords such as you . Swear faith to me and you shall have mercy .
URYENS: Noble knights swear faith to a mere squire ?
ARTHUR: You are right . I 'm not yet a knight . You , Uryens , will knight me .
MERLIN: What 's this , what 's this ? !
URYENS: In the name of God , of Saint Michael and Saint George , I give you the ight to bear arms , the power to mete justice . Arthur looks up .
ARTHUR: That duty I will solemnly obey as knight and King . Uryens is deeply moved .
URYENS: Rise , my King . I am your humble knight , and I swear allegiance to the courage in your veins , for so strong it is , it 's source must be Uther . I doubt you no more .
ARTHUR: Owww
GUENEVERE: It did n't hurt too much , did it ?
ARTHUR: Ye
GUENEVERE: I 'm pretty good at stitchery . I 've sewn my father 's wounds more than once . He starts to get up .
ARTHUR: But I have to leave tomorrow . The forests are thick with rebels , invaders plunder our shores
GUENEVERE: And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued ?
ARTHUR: I did n't know Leondegrance had a daughter .
GUENEVERE: Well , then , I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters , so you can avoid their castles .
ARTHUR: I 'm going .
GUENEVERE: Quiet , or I 'll sew up your mouth too .
MERLIN: A king must marry , after all .
ARTHUR: of course
MERLIN: There are maidens as fair , and faire than Guenevere . If I put my mind to it , I could see them now , many of them , weeping for love of you , watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles . Offering you their every favor . Rich , cleverbut if it is to be Guenevere , so be it . A shadow of doubt crosses Arthur 's brow .
ARTHUR: Who will it be ? Put your mind to it , then .
MERLIN: Guenevere . And a beloved friend who will betray you .
ARTHUR: Guenevere
MERLIN: You 're not listening . Your heart is not . Love is deaf as well as blind .
GUENEVERE: They are only for you , for in them I mixed things that heal , but not too quickly ; and things that make limbs sleepy , preventing escape , but keep one 's mind sharp .
ARTHUR: What 's in them ? She takes a cake and bites into it .
GUENEVERE: It is an ancient mixture , containing only soft , unborn grains , and flavored with roses . The rest is secret .
MERLIN: Looking at the cake is like looking at the future . Until you have savored its bitterness and its sweetness , its texture and its perfume , what do you really know ? And then , of course , it will he too late .
SIR ECTOR: He is the mightiest and fairest of knights .
ARTHUR: We fought and won battles , and now one man defeats all my knights ? I will go .
SIR KAY: A king must not engage in single contest . I 'll go again .
ARTHUR: Where is Merlin ? The squires are silent .
MERLIN: I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey , and I did n't feel up to using any more magic just yet . Anyway , I was in less danger than you 'll be in today .
ARTHUR: So you were stealing their honey . They should have killed you .
MERLIN: Come now . So much anger for such a little crime ? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you ?
ARTHUR: You know full well there is , and I go to meet it now . Come witness my evenge .
LANCELOT: Good day to you , sir .
ARTHUR: Move aside . This is the King 's road , and the knights you joined arms against were his very own .
LANCELOT: I await the King himself . His knights are in need of training .
ARTHUR: I am King , and this is Excalibur , sword of kings from the dawn of time . Who are you , and why do you block the way ?
LANCELOT: I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake , from across the sea . I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom , and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword 's service .
ARTHUR: That is a wild boast . You lack a knight 's humility .
LANCELOT: Not a boast , sir , but a curse . Never have I met my match in joust or duel .
ARTHUR: Move aside !
LANCELOT: I will not . You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms , under the eyes of God . He crosses himself .
ARTHUR: Then may He give me the strength to unhorse you and send you with one low back across the sea .
LANCELOT: Hold ! I offer you another lance .
ARTHUR: I will not .
LANCELOT: I sought only not to harm you , sir .
ARTHUR: So be it , to the death .
LANCELOT: It is you , sir , who knows not the virtue of humility , as a true king must .
ARTHUR: What horror is this ? Merlin ! Merlin approaches , pale , gripped by dread .
MERLIN: The sword is broken . Hope is broken
ARTHUR: My pride broke it , my rage broke it Humiliation and defeat lie in ambush even for a king . This excellent knight who fought with fairness and grace was meant to win . With Excalibur , I tried to change that verdict .
MERLIN: The Lady of the Lake . Take it . Take it , quickly !
ARTHUR: Thanks to God , you are alive .
LANCELOT: I , the best knight in the world , ested ! This is a great day , for my search is over . I love you , my King .
ARTHUR: You are still the best knight in Christiandom . You gained a hundred advantages over me . It is I who must love you , for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitte lesson .
LANCELOT: Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place .
ARTHUR: But your life and lands are far from here .
LANCELOT: I gave up my castles and my lands ! He thumps his breastplate .
ARTHUR: And a great heart it is . Sir Lancelot , you will be my champion .
LANCELOT: In the name of Jesus Christ and His holy blood , I swear eternal faith to Arthur , King . They embrace , and Merlin watches .
KNIGHT: We killed every one of them . Burnt their ship
ARTHUR: Lancelot , how did you fare in the North ?
LANCELOT: We spared the lives of a few , so they could sail home and tell thei fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur 's knights Arthur turns toward Uryens .
ARTHUR: And you , Uryens ?
URYENS: Victory !
ARTHUR: Lot , and you ?
LOT: We drove the invaders into the sea .
ARTHUR: You , Gawain , the East ?
GAWAIN: The East is ours again . Cheers greet each declaration .
ARTHUR: The war is over . One land , one King . Peace .
KNIGHT: Let me through . I fought the King 's attle too . He must know my story .
MERLIN: Chaos confusion brutes savages troglodytes Stand ack make space .
ARTHUR: Your ancient wisdom and infinite sight have forged this circle , Merlin . Hereafter we shall come together in a circle , to tell and hear of deeds good and brave . I will build a table where this fellowship shall meet . And a hall around the table . And a castle about the hall .
LANCELOT: I swear never to rest twice on the same pillow till all men live at peace .
KNIGHT: Good day , sir .
LANCELOT: Good day to you .
ARTHUR: I do . Rise , Lancelot , come with me .
LANCELOT: Only give me leave to ride out again , to do what I am most able to do , and happiest doing .
GUENEVERE: He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding , and tell his deeds himself .
ARTHUR: I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers .
LANCELOT: I will stay Madame . Merlin leans close to Arthur .
MERLIN: The knights of Galys approach the camp . It would be politic
ARTHUR: to ride out and meet them .
GUENEVERE: Do n't start a war on my wedding day !
ARTHUR: Without Lancelot ? !
GUENEVERE: Look Lancelot . The maids and ladies whisper about you . They all dream of winning you , young and old , fair and ugly . Lancelot blushes .
LANCELOT: No .
GUENEVERE: Why ?
LANCELOT: I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest . That is enough .
GUENEVERE: And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you ?
LANCELOT: There is one .
GUENEVERE: Who ? !
LANCELOT: You .
GUENEVERE: Me ?
LANCELOT: Yes . I would swear my love to you .
GUENEVERE: To me ? But why ?
LANCELOT: I can not love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend . And , in pledging my love to you , I can not love any other woman .
MERLIN: No , no , I need air .
URYENS: Merlin , do n't you join the celebration ?
MORGANA: I remember you , Merlin . I was a child . You took my brother away .
MERLIN: You left your husband 's side ? You left your brother 's wedding ?
MORGANA: Is that Mandrake , Lord Merlin ?
MERLIN: It is .
MORGANA: Can it truly be used for magic ?
MERLIN: Yes sometimes His gaze drifts toward the chapel .
BISHOP: Drink this the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord .
PERCEVAL: Sorry . Hungry .
LANCELOT: Do n't be afraid .
PERCEVAL: You 're an angel ! Not a devil
LANCELOT: Just a man . A knight in the King 's service .
PERCEVAL: You 're a man ? ! with metal skin ! Perceval is beside himself with enthusiasm .
LANCELOT: You 've got a lot to learn .
PERCEVAL: I 'll learn take me to the King What 's a King ?
LANCELOT: Very well . Climb up .
PERCEVAL: I will run .
LANCELOT: Listen , boy , it 's more than twenty days from here .
PERCEVAL: Twenty days ! ? The world is that big ?
KAY: Kitchen knives and greasy spits will e your weapons , boy .
FAT MAN: I brew ale , sirfrom old shoesI am an honest tradesman sir . I must sell what I produce . He wo n't buy ale and he wo n't pay . Pay up ! He leans ove the barrel and sucks in the vapors . The vapors are mine .
THIN MAN: How would you know I , sir , have the misfortune to live next to this criminal What loss in that ? Not to me ! Pay fo what ? Why ? ! They are floating on the wind . Arthur is both amused and exasperated .
ARTHUR: Enough ! What is a fair price fo the smell of your ale ?
FAT MAN: That 's why we have come to you , si There 's no one else who can tell us .
ARTHUR: What does it cost to get drunk on your ale ?
FAT MAN: At least three shillings , sir . Arthur addresses the Thin Man .
ARTHUR: Give me three shillings .
MORGANA: What did I see today in the wizard 's eyes ? Censure , because I enjoy a few words with a young handsome knight ? Merlin is in agony , a bug stuck on a pin .
MERLIN: No , no , of course not . You are young
MORGANA: It 's clear you are , and it irks me .
MERLIN: No . Yes , I am . I am jealous . I want to write poems about you with moonbeams , make the sea sing you name
MORGANA: A lovestruck page !
MERLIN: Shh yes , yes . Sit with me , please Morgana .
MORGANA: A steamy , panting , lovestruck page . But what good are songs and poems to me ? They are the barter of ordinary love . A gift that reflected you greatness is the only one worthy of your love .
MERLIN: I showed you all my conjuring tricks
MORGANA: The deepest secrets , the forbidden formulas
MERLIN: Maybe maybe
ARTHUR: Merlin , are you counselor to the King , or to my sister ? Some knights laugh .
MERLIN: At your service , sir .
ARTHUR: Then answer me this . For years peace has reigned in the land . Crops grow in abundance , there is no want . Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice , even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day . Tell me , Merlin have we defeated evil , as it seems ?
MERLIN: Good and evil ; there is never one without the other . Arthur is taken aback .
ARTHUR: Where hides evil , then , in my kingdom ?
MERLIN: Never where you expect it , that 's all I know .
SIR GAHALT: If we have peace and justice , why is Lancelot never with us ? Why is he always riding out on his quests ? He must know where this evil is .
SIR GAWAIN: Could there be evil within Lancelot himself ? To live above human folly , as is his aim , is to be overly proud .
SIR GAHALT: He pays no heed even to the Queens longing for his company .
GUENEVERE: What is it you would have your words mean , Sir Gahalt ?
MORGANA: Do n't listen to him . You are the Queen .
ARTHUR: Sir Gahalt , answer the Queen .
GUENEVERE: No . I meant not to be angry with you , Sir Gahalt . In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has ead its own evil . You merely repeat it . Please , sir , have one of those apples that Lancelot loves , and in that gesture partake of its goodness .
SIR GAHALT: I am most honored , my lady .
SIR GAWAIN: Hear me , Lord Arthur , and knights and chieftains I charge Guenevere with the murder of my brother .
GUENEVERE: I did n't I am innocent .
SIR GAWAIN: I champion this truth That Queen Guenevere murdered Sir Gahalt with the aid of sorcery .
ARTHUR: The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf .
GUENEVERE: Not you , my husband ? Arthur can not look at her .
SIR GAWAIN: She must be burnt at the stake . That is the sentence for murder done with magic .
ARTHUR: It is . Lords and knights of the Round Table , as her husband I say that this deed was not done by Guenevere . Who among you will champion this truth ?
CARADOC: I am torn .
PERCEVAL: I will champion you , my lady .
GUENEVERE: I thank you , but you are not yet a knight .
PERCEVAL: I will find Lancelot ! He will come !
MERLIN: Boys ! boys will be boys
PERCEVAL: I have found you . The Queen . An apple . Tomorrow . Sir Gawain
LANCELOT: It must wait , child . These good ladies , for whom I intervened once , will honor me with a meal . I am eholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection .
GUENEVERE: Why ca n't you be my champion ?
ARTHUR: If I am your judge , I can not be you champion . When I act as your King , I can not be your husband .
GUENEVERE: And you can not love me
ARTHUR: The laws , my laws , must bind everyone , high and low , or they are not laws at all . Lancelot will come
GUENEVERE: And if he can not be found , no othe knight will champion me , though you eseeched each and every one of them . Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eage oy ?
LANCELOT: Guenevere , I fight against myself He loses consciousness .
ARTHUR: Is he coming ?
PERCEVAL: He heard Lady Guenevere 's request and he said nothing . That is all . Arthur hides his pain behind a rigid mask .
SIR GAWAIN: My Lord , the sun is upon the field . The Queen has no champion . I demand justice , as is my right .
ARTHUR: So it is . Perceval leaps onto his horse .
PERCEVAL: Let me champion the Queen ! Sir Gawain looks at the squire with contempt .
SIR GAWAIN: Since no knight comes forward , I demand justice
ARTHUR: Boy , kneel .
PERCEVAL: Perceval !
LANCELOT: It 's my task to prove the Queen 's innocence .
SIR GAWAIN: The Queen is innocent . I yield to your mercy , Sir Lancelot . Lancelot collapses in a dead faint .
MERLIN: Flesh on flesh . You must press on the wound , Guenevere , hold it , and it will begin to bind .
ARTHUR: Merlin , tell me . Now that Guenevere is returned to me
MERLIN: What is it my child ?
ARTHUR: Will I have a son ?
MERLIN: Yes .
ARTHUR: Just yes ? No mad laughter , no riddles , nothing but a simple yes ? That frightens me .
MERLIN: A king should be afraid , always . The enemy is everywhere . Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle , on the deer paths of his forest , o in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest , in here . He taps his skull and smiles .
GUENEVERE: Flesh on flesh . I will heal you .
ARTHUR: They miss the battlefield . I think we do too .
LANCELOT: But one can still keep a sword sharp iding out in the name of the King 's law .
ARTHUR: It is not easy for the young ones to learn knightly virtues without the hard teaching of war and quest . It is only your example , Lancelot , that inds them now . Then , addressing the hall
MERLIN: What ? The greatest ? They blend togethe like the metals we mix to make a good sword .
ARTHUR: I did n't ask for poetry . Which is it ?
MERLIN: All right . Truth . It must be truth , above all . When a man lies he murders some part of the world .
LANCELOT: Conversation and court life do n't suit me . I must take my rest in the forest . Guenevere stifles her dismay .
ARTHUR: Has n't Merlin mended your wound ?
LANCELOT: It is deep
ARTHUR: You will be sorely missed . Heal yourself and come back .
LANCELOT: Why ? You will destroy Arthur , and us
GUENEVERE: Love demands it .
LANCELOT: There are things about love
GUENEVERE: Nothing !
LANCELOT: By my knight 's sword , I swore faith
ARTHUR: I am alone and betrayed . By my wife , y my beloved friend , by my knights . And by you . Perhaps most of all by you . For you made me , you forged this wretched life . And like a child tired of a toy , you toss me aside , a abbling lecher trotting after my sister
MERLIN: That is my destiny . I have a destiny , too
ARTHUR: With all your powers , you are content to be ridiculed , laughed at
MERLIN: My powers fade , Arthur . I resort to cheap tricks Yes ! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness , I join in the making of it , so no one can betray me . But you ! You betray yourself .
ARTHUR: Me ? I have lived by the oath of king and knight .
MERLIN: You betray the boy who drew the sword , the boy who saw the Dragon the Dragon who moves close by , coiling and uncoiling , restless , looking down , waiting for the King to be a king
ARTHUR: I must do it myself . I must kill them both . Lancelot and Guenevere . Will you ride with me , Merlin ?
MERLIN: I can not . I must not . Here I must stay .
MORGANA: Crazy old fool . You think yourself a kingmaker . Ha ! A meddler , more likely . Look what a mess you 've made of things . Merlin smiles knowingly at her .
MERLIN: I ? Perhaps , perhaps . I 'm losing interest , Morgana I have helped menor meddled in their affairs , if you would have it that waysince the dawn of time . Now let them live y their own laws . Let them stand on their own feet . The gods of once are gone forever , it is time for men Morgana , make a man out of me . Kiss me .
MORGANA: You know what I want . I want the secret of true magic , how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world .
MERLIN: That I can not . She breaks away , provocative , alluring .
MORGANA: Then I will not .
LANCELOT: Why did n't he kill us ?
GUENEVERE: He has given up .
LANCELOT: The King without his sword , the land without a king
GUENEVERE: We are to blame .
MERLIN: When Arthur built the castle , I carved out a place for myself , where I could laugh or sleep , and no one would other me .
MORGANA: People make you laugh ? He laughs .
MERLIN: They do .
MORGANA: Why ?
MERLIN: They do n't know how close they live to the edge of delight or disas
MORGANA: You are truly magnificent !
MERLIN: Flattery ! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games ? Preying on you weakness of others . That 's your power , a petty evil . Mine is great . Great plans . Impossible dreams . Laughable endings
MORGANA: Merlin , the powers of Summoning , the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing . Show me !
MERLIN: I wo n't . You would misuse such power . I have paid enough for you , and I will have you .
MORGANA: Make magic , my foolish wizard . Fo our love . Weave a marvelous room around us , a room worthy of ou coupling .
MERLIN: What do you want ? You must desire it for me to weave it .
MORGANA: Walls of shining crystals , burning with red fire , furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man
MERLIN: Desire it and it will be as you desire .
MORGANA: It 's only a semblance . You disappoint me . She begins lacing up her loosened gown .
MERLIN: Do n't touch the walls . Come close to me .
MORGANA: Do it , Merlin , the deepest secret . Fix it with the charm of Making , fo our endless pleasure .
MERLIN: For you
ARTHUR: Has no one seen Merlin ?
KNIGHT: Did you see ? The King was without Excalibur
MORGANA: I 'll weep for you , brother , for a King must not weep .
ARTHUR: Guenevere ! You are
"GUENEVERE": Do n't speak . A thousand words , a hundred thousand words , would only e prologue to the truth that must e. That you , King , and I , your Queen , eget a son to bond our love and to strengthen our weak kingdom with a successor . Come , my lord
MORGANA: The moon flows in my blood to meet your seed . And already I bear him who will be King .
ARTHUR: Who will ride the labyrinths of the forest , to the very root of his soul , to the very ends of the earth , to find the secret that will redeem us from the evil that has fallen upon us , and make this chalice , and ourselves , whole again ? Gawain rises and draws his sword in salute .
SIR GAWAIN: I will ride forth in the name of that quest , and commit my strength and my soul to it .
PERCEVAL: I will go .
ARTHUR: Gawain , a dreadful fear is upon me , that we may never meet again , that the fellowship will be no more
PERCEVAL: We will find the secret or die .
ARTHUR: Kay , I know your heart yearns to go , ut I am prisoner to my duties , and you must be to yours , at my side .
MORGANA: The blood of this knight will feed the god in the earth , he is weak with hunger , and he will be made strong by this blood . Then he will plant his seed , and the land will be fertile once again .
GAWAIN: Arthur , forgive me . I die without the secret . I have failed .
MORGANA: Look , Mordred , a true prize for the giant . The lamb rides into our jaws .
PERCEVAL: That it might be impossible makes it all the more necessary .
MORGANA: Fool ! Uncover him . I 'll show you the mystery of life . It 's death Do it , Mordred !
MORDRED: I feel it , Mother . I will give his lood to the giant .
MORGANA: You did n't kill him ! You did n't kill him ! But suddenly she begins kissing him tenderly .
PERCEVAL: We 'll become good friends .
LANCELOT: Where are you going , Lancelot , in your iron tomb ? Still trying to save the world ? The best the bravest the greatest fool that ever lived . Now the world rots . Death is king of the earth . And it is you who make it so , Lancelot .
FIGURE: What is the secret of the chalice ? Who does it serve ?
PERCEVAL: The chalice . The secret was in my grasp . I let it slip , afraid fo myself . A question was asked . I did n't understand . I did n't try . I failed
KAY: Your son Mordred is at the gate . Arthur comes alive .
ARTHUR: At last
KAY: Do n't recognize him . You were trapped y Morgana 's sorcery .
ARTHUR: Gawain and Perceval , Bors and Bohort , Caradoc and Ector , and all the otherslost to me . Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall . All I have left is the memory of their fellowship . Echoes and memories . I am a ghost of the King that once was Mordred is real , alive , my own flesh and blood . I will see him , I must .
MORDRED: Father
ARTHUR: Rise , Mordred .
MORDRED: I have come to claim what is mine , Father .
ARTHUR: I recognize you only as my son , no more .
MORDRED: And you are the great King ? The lords have rebelled . Invaders attack the coasts . Crops do n't grow . There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land . Only I am feared . I will be king . You may have lost Excalibur , ut I have found my own weapon of power . There .
ARTHUR: Your mother told you that ?
MORDRED: And I offer only this , Father . To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit , as man and king .
ARTHUR: So be it .
PERCEVAL: Illusions . I will never find it again I am sorry , woman , that I frightened you .
PEASANT: The little we had , we gave to Mordred 's knights . He has taken this land . Tell the King that now we must look to Mordred .
SECOND PEASANT: But we will give you some water
PERCEVAL: I have lost my horse , my armor , my sword . I have lost my way . I have lost my strength . I have lost everything I will not lose hope .
FIGURE: Who does it serve ?
PERCEVAL: You , my lord .
FIGURE: I have waited long for you . Once you almost saw , but fear blinded you . Why am I served from the chalice ?
PERCEVAL: Because you and the land are one .
FIGURE: I am wasting away and I can not die . And I can not live .
PERCEVAL: You and the land are one . Drink from the chalice . You will be reborn and the land with you .
FIGURE: But who am I ? Perceval begins to kneel .
PERCEVAL: You are my lord and King . You are Arthur .
ARTHUR: I did n't know how empty was my soul until it was filled .
KAY: Perceval , you have returned !
ARTHUR: Ready my knights for battle ; they will ride with their King once more . I have lived through others far too long ! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt . My knights have fought my causes . Mordred carries my sins . Now , at last , I will rule .
NUN: Go away . No man is allowed beyond these doors .
ARTHUR: I am Arthur .
GUENEVERE: I loved you much , as King , and sometimes as husband , but one can not gaze too long at the sun in the sky .
ARTHUR: Forgive me , my wife , if you can . I was not born to live a man 's life , ut to be the stuff of future memory . The fellowship was a brief beginning , a fair time that can not be forgotten ; and because it will not be forgotten , that fair time may come again . Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was , and the dream of what could be .
GUENEVERE: I have kept it .
ARTHUR: I never dared to hope all these years that it was in your keeping .
KNIGHT: It is only me and my son . All othe knights of the dukedom have rallied to Mordred .
ARTHUR: What horror is that ?
KNIGHT: Mordred , sir . He digs for precious metals , with which he buys the loyalty of men at arms , binding them to his side .
ARTHUR: I am outnumbered ten to one by Mordred 's forces . Merlin , I need you at my side as you were once , my friend , to give me courage . There are no war tricks that will fool Mordred . He was weaned on blood .
MERLIN: I know . I have heard noises and echoes through the stones
ARTHUR: What is this place , Merlin ?
MERLIN: It is like a tree . The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men . Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree . And the stars whispe ack to men the future course of events . But the earth is being torn apart , its metals stolen , and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge . In fact , I nearly did n't make it in one piece .
ARTHUR: Where have you been these many years ? Is it true that Morgana
MERLIN: Stories You brought me back . Your love brought me back . Back to where you are now , in the land of dreams
ARTHUR: Is this a dream ? Tell me , Merlin !
KAY: Merlin , will I live ? I was dreaming
ARTHUR: Of Merlin ?
KAY: Yes . He spoke to me . He said I would fight bravely tomorrow . I have neve dreamed of Merlin before .
ARTHUR: I dreamed of him too Merlin lives ! He lives in our dreams now , in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one . He speaks to us from there .
MERLIN: I have returned , enchantress . You are beautiful , magnificent . Have you used up all the magic you stole from me to keep yourself young ? Have you any magic left to do battle with Merlin ?
MORGANA: You provoke me , Merlin .
MERLIN: What 's behind that beauty ? A wizened , cold-hearted snake .
MORGANA: Burning with the fire of desire , I am the flames that consume the staff to ashes .
MERLIN: I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames .
MORGANA: I am the desert , where wate disappears
MERLIN: I am the sea , which covers the desert forever under its weight .
MORGANA: I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea , escaping She laughs at her cleverness .
MERLIN: Fog and mist ! You could n't be that . You do n't have enough magic .
MORGANA: I have the desire and I have the magic
MERLIN: You are mine at last . I am the sea and you will never escape me . Fog and Mist ! ?
LIEUTENANT: A fog is rising , sir .
MORDRED: That can not be . He rises and goes out with the lieutenant .
ARTHUR: Kay , you will lead the attack . Perceval , you will stay with me . Kay draws his sword in salute , elated .
PERCEVAL: There are too many on Mordred 's side . We can not hold out much longer .
KAY: He can be no other .
ARTHUR: Lancelot ? It is Lancelot !
PERCEVAL: No , my lord . We seek Mordred .
KAY: I will join him .
ARTHUR: Has anyone seen Lancelot ?
SQUIRE: He lies over there , sir .
ARTHUR: Squire ! Here !
LANCELOT: Arthur .
ARTHUR: Lancelot , I will save you Do n't die .
LANCELOT: My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table .
ARTHUR: You are that and much more . You are its greatest knight , you are what is est in men . Now we will be together
LANCELOT: It is the old wound , that has been opened . I have always known it would e the gateway to my death , for it has never healed . Let my heart do its job , my King , and pump me empty
ARTHUR: She is , Lancelot .
PERCEVAL: The fog is lifting . Only we remain alive .
ARTHUR: But for Mordred . Where is Mordred ?
MORDRED: Where is Arthur ?
ARTHUR: No , Perceval . Now it is time for me to raise my sword . Mordred , prepare to meet your death .
MORDRED: I wait for you , Father .
ARTHUR: Draw the spear from me . Do it .
PERCEVAL: I can not
ARTHUR: Take Excalibur . Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it .
PERCEVAL: It is too precious a thing . I ca n't
ARTHUR: When you threw it in , what did you see ?
PERCEVAL: I saw nothing .
ARTHUR: By itself it is only a piece of steel . Its power comes from he who wields it . For now there is no one . Do as I have ordered !
PERCEVAL: Arthur !
LEVI: Written like this . One word . Small e. Capital X , capital Z .
LEVI: Yes , it is . The world 's greatest game designer is here , in person , to lead you , the first test enclave , through her newest creation , eXistenZ by Antenna
GELLER: The world of games is in a kind of a trance . People are programmed to accept so little , ut the possibilities are so great .
PAUSE: You probably thought that tonight , we were going to test a new game that I designed . Excited murmurings from the crowd .
GELLER: But there is no new game to test , at least , not in the usual sense . Confused , slightly disappointed mutterings .
LEVI: MetaFlesh .
TOGETHER: Yes , Mr ; Levi .
LEVI: And how many of these precious prototypes did we manage to bring with us ?
FEMALE ASSISTANT: Twenty-one , Mr. Levi .
SOTTO VOCE: Twenty-one ? I thought we had an even two dozen .
MALE ASSISTANT: The first three we opened were unhealthy .
LEVI: Really ? Any chance that some of the others ?
FEMALE ASSISTANT: We think we 're clean .
RESTRAINED FURY: God-damn better be .
LEVI: We have twenty-one prototype MetaFlesh Game-Pods , and that means that for our first wave test enclave we need twenty-one volunteers who will port in these slave units with the Game-Pod Goddess herself
PIKUL: Hold it . Not so fast . In response , the fan thrusts a card at him .
DICHTER: Oh , god . I hope I 'm not too late . Did I miss the port-in ?
PIKUL: It 's just the first wave . You can e part of the second wave . OK , Joel Dichter . Put your arms up . I have to scan you . Metal and heavy synthetics ca n't come in .
INCREDULOUS: A weapons check ?
PIKUL: More for recording devices . Lotta money invested in these games . Industrial espionage happens . What 's in this case ?
DICHTER: I brought my game-pod . It 's got original Marway tissue architecture . It 's kind of obsolete but I was hoping ,
PIKUL: You wo n't need it tonight . Everything 's provided for .
DICHTER: Migod ! Is that who I think it is ?
.PIKUL: Yeah , that 's her . She 's something , is n't she ?
DICHTER: But why would a star like he come to a product seminar in a little one-horse town like this ?
PIKUL: This is where the real people live , Joel . Her real fans , like you .
DICHTER: Yeah , well , you said it . Just like me .
LEVI: Everything 's in order . Are you eady , Allegra ?
PUMPED: Sure . This is my favourite part .
GELLER: I 'm ready to download eXistenZ by Antenna Research into you all now . I 'm warning you , it 's going to be a wild ride , but do n't panic no matter what happens . I 'll see you all back here in no time at all .
TO LEVI: She seems to be very shy . It never occurred to me that a big star would be shy .
LEVI: She spends most of her time alone in a room designing her games . I think she 'd like it best if she never had to show them to anybody .
PIKUL: Really ? She does n't enjoy all the adulation ?
LEVI: She hates having to port in with her fans . It 's too intimate .
PIKUL: Then why does she do it ?
LAUGHS: We make her do it .
PIKUL: By `` we '' you mean , the game company , Antenna Research ?
LEVI ': That 's what I mean .
PIKUL: Why ?
SUDDENLY SUSPICIOUS: Are you with us or did an independent security company send you ?
PIKUL: Me ? Oh , I 'm with your own management training program . I want to end up in marketing and public relations . The only thing I know about security is how to switch this thing on .
SATISFIED: Well , for example , we 've spent a fortune developing eXistenZ , but we all know it 's a risky project . She might have to make changes . It 's the only way we can convince her that there might be a problem .
PUZZLED: A problem with her new game ?
LEVI: eXistenZ is a lot more than a game .
PIKUL: Yeah , right , it 's a game system . I heard that .
LEVI: And we 're worried that it 's too intellectual , too complex , too weird , too artsy . That argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans . She hates to be ejected in the flesh , so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat .
ADMIRINGLY: 4 I 've heard that she 's very sensitive .
PIKUL: What are they doing ?
LAUGHS: It 's the new Antenna Research theme song . We thought this would e a good way to launch it . Everybody who plays eXistenZ is going to be very familiar with that tune .
PIKUL: Catchy .
DICHTER: Death to eXistenZ ! Death to Antenna Research ! Death to the demoness Allegra Geller !
TO DICHTER: No ! Do n't do it !
LEVI: Get her out of here ! Save her ! There might be more of them ! Go on !
PIKUL: Me ? Me take her ?
LEVI: We have enemies in our own house . Trust no one . Trust no one
SCREAMS: She 's coming with me ! I 'm esponsible for her ! She 's supposed to come with me !
LAUGHS: Am I ? With you ?
PIKUL: Yeah , you 're coming with me .
GELLER: I ca n't lose this ! I ca n't lose this !
WILD: No , no !
GELLER: Why no ?
PIKUL: I do n't trust the driver !
GELLER: You drive , idiot !
FRANCES: What 's the commotion , Miss Geller ? Say , are you all right ? What 's goin ' on in there ?
GELLER: We need this vehicle , and we need it without you . But with the keys .
FRANCES: I ca n't do that . I ca n't abandon my vehicle .
GELLER: Get out , Frances . You can say you were hijacked .
CHUCKLES: It 'll take more than a dead squirrel to get me out of this seat .
FRANCES: You have to push the shift leve down to get it into reverse .
GELLER: Thanks , Frances .
PIKUL: I normally like the countryside , do n't you ? Normally , the country is relaxing and calm .
GELLER: Only if you do n't really know what 's going on .
PIKUL: What do you mean ?
GELLER: There is great stress and ange and violence in the countryside . Thousands of life forms all screaming ME ME ME and trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms . It 's terrifying and exhausting .
LAMELY: Well , I like the countryside .
GELLER: That 's good , ` cause you might end up spending a lot of time here .
PIKUL: I might ?
GELLER: Sure . If you go back home to the city , they 'll probably be waiting for you .
PIKUL: They ?
GELLER: Yeah . My assassins . They 'd want to have a little talk with you about where I am .
PIKUL: I was hoping that was just one crazy guy .
GELLER: Did you hear the way he screamed at me ? He was n't alone .
PIKUL: Everybody likes a conspiracy . It 's more satisfying than just one crazy guy doing one crazy thing . Geller goes silent .
GELLER: Not country people . Games people . The countryside 's full of games development people , project co- ordinators , little factories - you name it .
PIKUL: That 's weird . I never knew that .
GELLER: The city 's full of bad microwaves , bad thermals , bad electro-optics . You ca n't shield from it anymore . You ca n't get true readings . The whole industry moved out of the city years ago .
PIKUL: So you know your way around . We can hide out .
GELLER: Maybe . But it seems I have some enemies I did n't know I had . `` Death to Allegra Geller . '' How 'd you like to hear somebody with a gun screaming , `` Death to Ted Pikul '' ?
PIKUL: Wow . Hey , how 'd you know my name ?
GELLER: You 're labelled .
PIKUL: Oh . Yeah .
PAUSE: How did you know how to fire that , gun ? I 've never seen anything like it .
GELLER: It has a trigger . I pulled it .
PIKUL: Can I see it ?
GELLER: Later . I think I 'm gon na use it in my next game . If there ever is a next game .
PIKUL: Migod , you 're bleeding . I forgot you got hit .
GELLER: What 's that ?
PIKUL: It 's my pink-fone . I 'm not sure I should answer it .
GELLER: Answer it .
PAUSE: What happened ? Some fan went crazy and started shooting up the place . I do n't know why . He was just nuts . Allegra Geller ? She 's with me . We 're OK. Yeah . Yeah .
PAUSE: You 're kidding me . You 're kidding me ! God . 1 ca n't believe it . I ca n't do that . No , how can I do that ? Well , I 'm not really sure where we are because
PIKUL: What ? Can I have my pink-tone ack ?
IN SHOCK: What did you do that for ? That was our lifeline to civilization .
GELLER: That was a rangefinder . As long as you have that , they know where you are .
PIKUL: They ? You mean head office ?
GELLER: I mean anybody .
PAUSE: I heard what Levi said to you . He said , `` We have enemies in our own house . '' He said it as he was dying .
FLUSTERED: I do n't think he died . I mean , do you ? I think he maybe fainted Maybe he went unconscious
PIKUL: That was Alex Kindred , head of publicity and marketing , at Antenna HQ
WISTFUL: .on that very expensive pink- fone you threw away .
DEEP SIGH: He said that some bizarre fanatical group called the Anti- eXistenZialists has put a price of 5 million dollars on you head , payable to anybody who kills you . It 's been released to all the media now . Everybody knows about it .
IN DISBELIEF: Anti-existentialists ?
PIKUL: No . Anti-eXistenZialists . Capital X , capital Z . They somehow found out about eXistenZ and they want to kill you for creating it . They say that the eXistenZ game system will `` finally destroy reality '' , or something totally nuts like that .
STRANGELY SATISFIED: Yeah .
PIKUL: It makes sense to you ? You 're not suprised ?
GELLER: I hear things . It 's hard to surprise me .
PAUSE: And what else ?
PIKUL: Kindred said that I 'm you odyguard and the company is holding me totally responsible for your safety .
PAUSE: Pikul , why do n't you have a gun with you ?
PIKUL: What ?
GELLER: You 're not armed . They told me you were my security but you have no weaponry .
PIKUL: Who told you that ? I 'm just a marketing trainee . My clinic master thought I 'd learn something about marketing if I moonlighted as a security guard on one of your test previews .
GELLER: Fuck . I 'm marked for death and they send me on the road with a PR nerd .
PIKUL: Jesus ! Marked for death !
GELLER: Do n't sweat it , Pikul . I 'll handle it . We just have to disappear for a while . And right now , we have to stop .
PIKUL: We do ? Why ?
DEADPAN: So we can have an intimate moment together .
IRRITATED: C'mon . If you 're gon na do it , do it .
GELLER: What do you mean ?
PIKUL: What I just dug out of you . It 's a tooth . A human tooth .
GELLER: Lem me see that weirdo pistol .
PIKUL: That thing was designed to get past any kind of metal o synthetics detector . It 's all flesh and bone .
GELLER: I suppose the smaller calibe pistols would have to fire baby teeth . The tooth fairy could go I into the arms business .
INCREDULOUS: That guy really came there tonight just to kill you .
WITH IRONY: Amazing , is n't it ?
GELLER: The whole gamesworld is in a kind of trance .
PIKUL: Yes . I remember you said that at the church .
GELLER: People are prepared to accept so little . They 're in a'cage formed out of their own limited
PIKUL: Where were you just now ? What were you doing ?
GELLER: I was wandering through eXistenZ - the new system , I mean . I like it in there . Of course , without another player you 're only a tourist . It 's frustrating .
PIKUL: Why wo n't you let me contact Antenna ? They 've got to be going crazy , wondering what 's happened to you . I mean , it 's not like we 've done something wrong . We just ran because we did n't know how many of them there were , ight ? I think we owe it to Antenna to let them know you 're all right , to get them to send somebody to help you who knows what he 's doing And besides , I ca n't I ca n't just keep doing this , whatever it is , you know , forever , not having any idea when it 's going to be
GELLER: Where 's your bioport ? Do n't tell me you were never fitted . I ca n't elieve it .
PIKUL: No , I was never fitted with a ioport . What do you care ?
GELLER: You 're hoping to get into the biz and you 've never played one of my games . You 've never played any game . That means you have no idea
LAMELY: My clinic master told me I do n't need to play a game to know how to sell it .
GELLER: Bullshit . Posturing . You do n't play my games , you do n't work fo Antenna Research , I 'll make sure of that .
PIKUL: Look , I 've been dying to play your games . But I have this - phobia about having my body penetrated - surgically . You know what I mean .
GELLER: I 'm not so sure I do .
PIKUL: Getting a bioport fitted I dunno . I ca n't do it . It 's too freaky . Makes my skin crawl .
GELLER: God , c'mon . They just pop you spine with a little hydro-gun . Shoot the port-plug into it . They do it at malls , like getting you ears pierced .
PIKUL: Yeah , sure . With only an infinitesimal chance of permanent spinal paralysis . I 've read all about it .
GELLER: It 's your chosen profession , geek .
HOTLY: There 's an intimacy involved in playing eXistenZ that is beyond description . It has to be experienced . And frankly , the two-player version is the most exquisitely intense . Would n't you like to play with me ?
PIKUL: Well , yeah , of course , but Let me , uh , let me call Antenna
GELLER: They would n't want to talk to you if they knew you had never had a ioport installed . It 's company policy , you know . They want you to be passionate about your work .
VERY SEDUCTIVE: Besides , once you 're ported , there 's no end to the games you can play .
HE'S SWEATING: You ca n't seriously want to play games now . Not here . Not while we 're being hunted down by crazy people . _
GELLER: My baby here took a huge hit in the church , Pikul . You see how she 's quivering ?
PIKUL: It she , yes , she 's quivering .
EMOTIONAL: When those UmbyCords got ripped out of her in the church , ripped
CHOKING UP: The only way I can tell if everything 's OK - the game 's not een contaminated , the pod , my aby , is not about to be crippled for life because of my negligence - the only way is to play eXistenZ with somebody friendly . Are you friendly , or are you not ?
PAUSE: Sure , all right . ( he might have found a way
OUT: Let 's do it let 's do it now . Let me see . To get an illegal , unregistered ioport installed at about midnight - we just drive up to your local country gas station , ight ?
GAS: Anything else I can do for you ?
GELLER: Well , Gas , you could check you ioport-plugs .
GAS: The what ? The sparkplugs ?
GELLER: You heard me . My friend here has a bioport problem .
COOL: A bioport , now , that 's a sort of a hole in your spine , is n't it ? Lotta assholes ` round here , but that 's generally it . I do n't know why you 'd be talking to me about that , lady . Geller smiles a knowing smile .
GELLER: Sure you do .
GAS: Allegra Geller . You changed my life .
PIKUL: What was your life like before ?
GAS: Before ?
PIKUL: Before it was changed by Allegra Geller .
GAS: I operated a gas station .
PIKUL: But you still operate a gas station , do n't you ?
GAS: Only on the most pathetic level of reality . Geller 's work liberated me .
PIKUL: Liberated ?
GAS: Did you ever play her game ArtGod ? One word , capital A , capital G ?
PIKUL: I do n't have a bioport , remember ?
GAS: `` Thou , the player of the game , art God . '' Very spiritual . Funny , too . God , the artist . The mechanic . Funny . Gas zips up his fresh overalls .
UNEASY: Those are sterile , are they ?
GAS: Not to worry . They way they set things up , you could fire in a ioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an infection .
PIKUL: Then why the clean overalls ?
GAS: It 's a mental thing . Helps me focus . The one thing you do n't want to do is miss with the stud- finder .
PIKUL: Oh , God .
BIG SMILE: God , the mechanic .
GAS: We call this thing a stud-finder . ' It locates the spot on your spine where the x intersects with the y . We do n't want to be even a micron out of whack . That 's when you get troubles . It 's a little adar/sonar/laser thingee . Marks you with a special range-finding dye .
PIKUL: Never say dye .
GAS: Lift up your shirt and turn around .
PIKUL: I did n't expect that to hurt . I expect the next part to hurt .
GAS: I 've never crippled anyone yet .
PIKUL: How many have you done ?
GAS: Three . Well , you 'll be the third .
GELLER: What 's going on , Gas ?
GAS: Hell , he 's acting like I 'm attackin ' him . People usually pay me.to do this , you know .
PIKUL: Yeah . All two of them . As you can see , I 've decided not to have a bioport installed .
GELLER: This is it , you see . This is the cage I was talking about , the cage of your own making which keeps you trapped and pacing about in the smallest possible space forever . Break out of you cage , Pikul . Break out now .
PIKUL: I love it . Great .
GAS: The procedure comes with its own epidural , just like when you have a baby . Kinda like instant paralysis from the waist down ? That 's why it did n't hurt you . It 'll wear off in about twenty minutes .
PIKUL: You 're looking more like a utcher than a mechanic .
GAS: Things do get kinda confused these days , do n't they ? I 'm gon na go wash up . You two make yourselves at home .
PIKUL: What are you doing ?
GELLER: We do n't have to wait for the swelling to go down .
PIKUL: You 're going to port into me ? While I 'm paralysed ?
GELLER: You wanted to play my game , did n't you ?
PIKUL: Yeah , I did , and I do , but Here ? Now ?
GELLER: It 's an instant-on world , is n't it ?
PIKUL: What 's that for ? It feels cold .
GELLER: New ports are sometimes a bit tight . Would n't want to hurt you .
PIKUL: How come bioports do n't get infected ? I mean , they open right into your body
GELLER: Listen to what you 're saying , Pikul . Do n't be ludicrous .
VERY NERVOUS: Do n't you think you could call me Ted ?
GELLER: Maybe afterwards .
FURIOUS: Shit , Pikul ! I ca n't believe this ! I trusted you and you blew my pod ! You must have neural- surged !
PIKUL: What do you mean ?
IN DESPAIR: I jacked you into my pod and you obviously panicked . Now it 's totally fucked ! This is a disaster !
PIKUL: I.. I was nervous , but I did n't panic .
FIGHTING HYSTERIA: I was forced to trust you and you panicked and you neural-surged , and you blew my pod .
PIKUL: You can get a new pod
GELLER: Pikul , in this pod is the only , the original version of eXistenZ , an entire game system that cost thirty-eight million to develop , not including pre-release marketing costs . And I 'm locked outside of my own game ! I ca n't get it out , or me in !
PIKUL: Are you serious ? This is the only version that exists ?
GELLER: Security is everything these days . It 's the only one and its stuck inside and it 's your fault .
PIKUL: But why is it my fault ? I 'm telling you , I did n't , I did not neural-surge . I did n't . I did n't feel any surging .
GAS: It is n't your fault . It 's my fault .
QUIETLY: Oh , no , Gas , not you .
GAS: I would n't try to use that ioport again , ` cept maybe for a toaster or something .
GELLER: What 's going on ?
GAS: You 're worth a lot of money . If you 're dead .
PIKUL: What are you talking about ?
GAS: You know what I 'm talking about . It 's all over the countryside . Five million for her dead body . No questions asked .
PIKUL: But , but she changed you life .
GAS: Yup . And now I 'm gon na change hers .
STALLING: But wait Why did you install a ad port into me ?
GAS: Seems there 's a big bonus fo killing Allegra Geller 's latest game , or whatever it is . I think I just did that , did n't I ?
GELLER: But can you kill a person ? Can you do that , Gas ? Can you kill me ? Hide my body . Contact the crazies . Trust them to pay up . Hand over my now-decaying , fucking grotesque corpse . Really expect them to hand over 5 mil cash ? Do n't you ever go to the fuckin ' movies ?
GAS: I like your script . I want to be in it .
PIKUL: Oh , God , I think he 's dead . I thought I could just distract him .
GELLER: You did distract him . Plug your toaster into that hole , corpse !
PIKUL: He wanted to kill you .
GELLER: Yep .
PIKUL: That 's two people in one day who wanted to actually kill you .
GELLER: I 've never been more popular .
PIKUL: Allegra , we need help .
GELLER: You 're right . I 've got to get this pod fixed .
PIKUL: We 're going skiing ?
GELLER: Nothing in the countryside is what it seems . It 's all appearance versus reality , and the reality here is something unique .
PIKUL: Look at that huge bug . It 's got two heads .
GELLER ': They breed them here . They 're not supposed to get away . They get out and walk towards the clubhouse .
PIKUL: What if somebody comes up here and really wants to ski ?
GELLER: Nobody actually physically skis any more , Pikul . You know that .
PIKUL: I 've watched some ski shows . Downhill racing , Austrian Alps .
CONTEMPTUOUSLY: Yeah , right .
VINOKUR: My darling Allegra . I am so pleased to see you here . They embrace .
GELLER: Kiri Vinokur , this is my odyguard , Ted Pikul .
VINOKUR: Hello , yes , I heard the idiculous story about this fatwa against you . The company is desperately trying to find you . Is it really serious ? Are you in danger ?
PIKUL: If I 'm her bodyguard , then she 's in grave danger .
GELLER: There have been a couple of attempts on my life already .
SHOCKED: No ! That 's unbearable . The company must stop this . They owe you every kind of protection .
GELLER: I do n't know if they can do anything about it . It seems to be open season on me .
VINOKUR ,: Well , you will be safe here , I can assure you of that . I will contact Antenna right away and have them send some people to come and collect you .
GELLER: Kiri , no , do n't . You must n't let anybody know we 're here unless you have to . I ca n't be sure that Antenna is completely safe fo me .
VINOKUR: I understand . Yes . The company draws many eccentric people into its fold . You can hide in one of the guest chalets . As long as you like . I will make sure you get fresh towels Geller pats her game-pod case .
GELLER: .and make sure I do n't lose everything I have in here .
VINOKUR: What did you port into ?
GELLER: Pikul 's bioport .
VINOKUR: Really ? That 's what did all the damage ?
PIKUL: It was a flawed installation - my first . It it neural-surged . Allegra says you can fix it .
VINOKUR: It fried some very expensive nerve boards . See ? Here . These are kaput . It 's a complex thing .
PIKUL: Nerve boards ?
VINOKUR: We use the nervous systems of specially-bred insects to create the electronic circuits on ou motherboards .
SMILES: Only Antenna Research has it .
PIKUL: Wow . And where do the batteries go ?
VINOKUR: Very funny .
GELLER: He 's not kidding . He 's a total PR nerd .
TO PIKUL: It ports into you , and you are the power source . Your body , you nervous system . Your energy . When you get tired , run down , it wo n't un properly .
VINOKUR: Landry here will finish up the pod-work . Meanwhile
TO PIKUL: Let 's get that nasty bioport out of you and get a nice , fresh one in there . We have guest chalets out back . You 're both welcome to stay . Now where did I put my ioport-plug puller.. ? Here it is .
TO PIKUL: Lie down on that couch and pull up your shirt .
PIKUL: It hurts . I think it 's infected .
GELLER: It 's not infected . It 's just excited . It wants action .
PIKUL: But I really do n't think that I want action . Me , I mean . The earer of the excited bioport . What I want is not now . Not here . I feel too too exposed .
GELLER: My baby here has now taken three major hits , one in the church , one in the gas station , and one on the operating table . The only way I can tell if everything 's OK - the game 's not been contaminated , the pod 's not fucked - is to play eXistenZ with somebody friendly . Are you friendly , or are you not ?
PIKUL: You 're telling me this thing will un off my body 's energy ?
PORTING IN: That 's how they work . See ? You 're hummin ' along already .
GELLER: All right . eXistenZ . Only from Antenna . Here we go .
APPREHENSIVE: You 've got a bit of an unfai advantage , do n't you ? How can I possibly compete with the designer of the system ?
GELLER: You could beat the guy who invented poker , could n't you ?
PIKUL: That was beautiful . I feel just like me . Is that kind of transition normal , a kind of smooth dissolve from place to place ?
GELLER: Depends on the style of the game . You can get jagged , brutal cuts , slow fades , shimmering little morphs
PIKUL: This is amazing . I had no idea . We we 're still ourselves , but we 're in the game . Where are we ?
GELLER: It 's basically a game store I used to hang out in as a kid .
ENCHANTED: Are you serious ?
GELLER: We 're ported into a game-pod together , remember ? eXistenZ has complete access to both ou central nervous systems . Its game architecture will be based on ou memories , our anxieties , ou preoccupations
DISENCHANTED: Are you serious ?
GELLER: You keep saying that . Look at this . Games I 've neve heard of . Biological Father . Hit By A Car . Viral Ecstasy . Chinese Restaurant . In Viral Ecstasy , you are a virus invading a specific human ody . You create ingenious viral strategies to cope with the efforts of the body 's immune system to destroy you ''
PIKUL: Wait a minute . That reminds me . What precisely is the goal of the game we 're playing now ? I mean , the rules , the objective Nobody 's ever really said anything about what you have to do in eXistenZ .
GELLER: The beauty of eXistenZ is that it changes every time you play it . It adapts to the individuals who are actually playing it . The esult is that you have to play the game to find out why you 're playing the game .
PIKUL: But that 's kind of cheating , is n't it ? Not to say confusing .
GELLER: Not at all . It 's a much more organic approach to gaming than classic , arbitrary , rule- dominated games . It 's the future , Pikul . You 'll see how natural it feels .
DISTRACTED: Look at this . Could this be the future too ? Ever see anything like this efore ?
NADER: These are delicate . You have to e careful .
PIKUL: Yes . I can imagine .
NADER: Cortical Systematics is the latest and the hottest . Not just a new game , but a new system .
GELLER: Will it work with an industry standard bioport ?
NADER: I have n't seen you two before , have I ? This is my place . Haimische , is n't it ? Funky ?
PIKUI,: We 're new in town .
NADER: Welcome to Dorsey Nader 's Game Emporium . I 'm Dorsey Nader . Is there anything I can help you with ?
GELLER: We 're just looking .
FURTIVELY: I have what you 're looking for .
PIKUL: You do ?
NADER: Follow me .
PAUSE: Who sent you ?
INSTANT RESPONSE: It 's none of your businesz who sent us . We 're here , and that 's all that matters .
PIKUL: Oh God , what happened ? I did n't mean to say that !
GIGGLING: It 's your character who said it . It 's a kind of schizophrenic feeling , is n't it ? But you 'll get used to it . There are things that have to be said to advance the plot and establish the characters , and those things get said whether you want to say them or not . Do n't fight it . Just go with it .
PIKUL: But should you be saying that in front of him ? Nader ?
GELLER: Look at him .
RE NADER: What 's he doing ?
GELLER: He 's gone into a game loop , he 's locked up , and he wo n't come out of it until you give him a prope game line of dialogue .
PIKUL: This is tricky .
GELLER: Start by repeating your last line . Include his name so he knows you 're talking.to him .
PIKUL: We 're here , Dorsey Nader , and that 's all that matters .
NADER: You 're right . That is all tha matters .
PIKUL: Well , Nader , you said you had what we want . We 're waiting .
NADER: You 're going to need these micro- pods to download your new identities . I assume that you oth have had those industry standard bioports you mentioned installed .
GELLER: Yes , of course , that 's right . We oth have bioports . Here she pauses , looks at Pikul .
PIKUL: I assumed we did . I mean , here . In the game . Of course , we might not .
GELLER: We 'd better check .
PIKUL: Yeah , it 's there . Looks a little different , but it 's there .
GELLER: I see what you mean .
TO NADER: Yes , we both have bioports .
UNLOCKING: Good . Port in and this 'll tell you all you need to know for now .
NADER: I 'm going to leave while you finish up here . It would n't be good for us all to be seen together . Nader gets up to leave , pauses at the door .
PIKUL: I assume that Nader is our entry point into the game .
GELLER: Yeah . Kinda disappointing .
PIKUL: Nader ?
GELLER: Yeah . Not a very well-drawn character . And his dialogue was just so-so .
PIKUL: Yeah .
PAUSE: Do we blame ourselves for that ? The bad dialogue ? Or would it be ad no matter who was ported in ?
GELLER: The game engine is just getting used to us . It 'll get more daring once it warms up .
PIKUL: What happened ?
GELLER: The whole pod just disappeared into your back .
PANICKY: It disappeared into my back ? ! It it 's in my spine ? It 's winding its way around my spinal cord ?
GELLER: Do n't panic , it 's just a game . Do you feel anything yet ?
PIKUL: No , I do n't . Not a thing . I do n't feel a thing . Uh , do you want me to do you ?
GELLER: What the hell was that ?
CONFUSED: That was n't me . That was my game character . I would n't have done that . Not here , anyway .
GELLER: You 're right . Our characters are obviously supposed to jump on each other . Probably to create emotional tension when dange happens . No use fighting it .
FIGHTING IT: What about our new identities ? Do you feel yours yet ?
CARESSING: They 'll take care of themselves .
PAUSE: I 'm very worried about my body . Geller stops , sits up .
GELLER: Your what ?
PIKUL: I mean , where are our real odies ? Are they all right ? Are they hungry ? What if there 's danger ?
GELLER: ( kissing and caressing
AGAIN: They 're just where we left them , sitting quietly , eyes closed . Just like meditating .
PIKUL: ( reluctantly kissing and
CARESSING BACK: I do n't know . I feel really vulnerable . Disembodied .
GELLER: Do n't sweat it . All your senses are still operating . You 'll pop ight out of the game if there 's a problem .
NOURISH: Tryin ' to remember who you are ?
PIKUL: Yes . I I 'm very new . Did you say trout farm ?
NOURISH: You know - raise baby trout from eggs and then stock the rivers with them .
BROAD GESTURE: Entire place used to be a trout farm . Seems like most everything used to be something else , does n't it ?
NOURISH: I You might be new but you seem to know what you 're doing .
GENUINELY PERPLEXED: It surprises me more than it surprises you .
WITH ADMIRATION: You might be new but you seem to know what you 're doing .
PIKUL: I , ah I 've been trained by the very best .
FURTIVE: So have I . Where do you plan to have lunch ?
PIKUL: I 'm new here . I have no plans fo lunch .
NOURISH 11: I suggest the Chinese restaurant in the forest . Everybody knows where it is . Just ask .
PIKUL: Wo n't you be going there too ?
NOURISH: I have other plans for lunch . But I do suggest that you order the special . And do n't take no for an answer .
PIKUL: All right , I 'll do that .
WORKER: Larry ?
STARTLED: Yes ?
WORKER: They need this in the back room . They asked for you .
PIKUL: What 's that mean ?
GESTURES: It means that they want you in the back room . They need more insect boards for the pod assembly bays .
PIKUL: Should I just get up and go there ?
NOURISH: Yeah . I 'll take care of you incoming boards .
PIKUL: I order the special .
GELLER,: I saw you make contact , Larry Ashen . What did the guy on the .l assembly line say to you ?
PIKUL: He told me where to have lunch .
WAITER: We have nice sea bass today . Shall I bring it for everyone ?
PIKUL: We want the special .
SLOWLY: We want the special . The waiter unfreezes , smiles grimly .
WAITER: The special is for special occasions . I can not give you the special .
PIKUL: But this is a special occasion . It 's
WAITER: A birthday is a special occasion . I will therefore bring the special for everybody .
PIKUL: I guess the special is n't very popular .
GELLER: I guess .
PIKUL: But you know , really , do n't you ? You do n't have to guess . I mean , it 's your game , your little universe .
GELLER: I do n't know . You have to understand that , to understand what we 've really created with eXistenZ .
PIKUL: You 're telling me , for example , that you do n't know what the special is ?
GELLER: Correct . I do n't .
PIKUL: Or why we ordered it .
GELLER: We ordered it because anothe game character told you to . That 's a clue we ca n't ignore . But that 's just basic games playing .
PIKUL: I want to put the game on pause .
PANICKING: The game can be paused , ca n't it ? I mean , all games can be paused , ight ?
GELLER: Sure , yeah , but why ? What 's wrong ? Are n't you dying to see what 's special about the special ?
PIKUL: I 'm feeling a little disconnected from my real life . I 'm kind of losing touch with the texture of it , you know what I mean ? I mean , I actually think there 's an element of psychosis involved here . I mean , I do n't know where my body really is , or where eality is , what I 've actually done , or not done .
GELLER: That 's a great sign . It means your nervous system is fully engaging with the game architecture . The game is a lot more fun when it starts to feel ealer than real .
PAUSE: Yeah .
SCREAMS: eXistenZ is paused ! The Chinese restaurant melts away .
PIKUL: Did I do that ? I guess I did .
GELLER: So how does it feel ?
PIKUL: What ?
GELLER: Your real life . The one you came ack for .
PIKUL: Just sitting here , it feels completely unreal . I 'm sure you knew that would happen .
GELLER: You 're stuck now , are n't you ? You want to go back to the Chinese estaurant because there 's nothing happening here . We 're safe . It 's boring .
PIKUL: Worse than that . I 'm not sure here , where we are , is real at all . This feels like the game . And you you 're beginning to t1 feel a bit like a game characte to me .
PAUSE: Did we really make love to each other ?
SHARP: Definitely not .
PIKUL: It feels like we did .
GELLER: Our characters did . I 'm sure it would be very different if we did .
PIKUL: I I 'm actually just like that in real life . You got the real Ted Pikul there , in the stockroom of the game store .
GELLER: Well , you did n't get the real Allegra Geller , I can tell you that . no
PIKUL: I did n't ? She kisses him gently .
GELLER: No . In real life I tend to lose control . It can get messy .
PAUSE: Let 's go back .
WAITER: Special order for the birthday girl . Hope you enjoy it very much .
PIKUL: I think I 've lost my appetite .
WAITER: A shame . Mutant creatures provide new and previously unimagined taste sensations .
SIGNIFICANTLY: Shall I clear all this away ?
GELLER: No , it looks terrific . Thank you . We 're happy . The waiter nods .
WAITER: Very good . Enjoy .
GELLER: Pikul , what are you doing ?
PIKUL: I do n't know . I find this disgusting but I ca n't help myself .
GELLER: Oh , good !
PIKUL: Good ? You think this is good ?
GELLER: Yeah . It 's a genuine game urge . It 's something that your game character was born to do . Do n't fight it .
PIKUL: I am fighting it , but it is n't doing me any good .
NOT SURE: It should be OK .
GELLER: Do you have that bridge in real life ?
PIKUL: Absolutely not . My teeth are perfect . Do n't ask me how I knew this thing was in my mouth .
GELLER: It probably was n't until you ordered the special .
CASUALLY: Death to the demoness Allegra Geller .
GELLER: That 's not funny !
PIKUL: Sorry , I could n't resist . But you know I do feel the urge to kill someone here .
TENSING: Who ?
PIKUL: I need to kill our waiter .
RELIEVED: Oh , well , that makes sense .
CALLS OUT: Waiter ! Waiter !
TO PIKUL: When he comes over , do it . Do n't hesitate .
PIKUL: But everything in this game is so ealistic . I do n't think I really could
GELLER: You wo n't be able to stop . You might as well enjoy it .
PIKUL: `` Free will '' is obviously not a ig factor in this little world of ours .
GELLER: It 's like real life - there 's just enough to make it interesting .
PIKUL: He 's too nice . I wo n't do it . The waiter arrives at their table .
WAITER: What can I do to make your lunch more pleasant ?
PIKUL: I found this in my soup and I 'm very upset .
GELLER: Through the kitchen ! That way !
NOURISH: Did you like the meal I prepared for you ?
PIKUL: Yes . It was very revealing .
NOURISH: It certainly was for me . You both passed our little test with flying colours .
GELLER: Why did the Chinese waiter have to die ?
NOURISH: A waiter hears many things spoken when people are relaxed and eating . A waiter has many opportunities for betrayal .
PIKUL: He betrayed you ?
NOURISH: He betrayed us . Out this way , quickly !
PIKUL: Is that where you caught today 's special ?
LAUGHS: The restaurant is controlled by us . We raise these mutant creatures as food and that is ou cover , but of course , we are also aising them as components fo undetectable and hypoallergenic weapons . Right under the noses of our enemies . And speaking of ou enemies , it 's important that you go back to work at Cortical Systematics . We need to maintain as many agents there as we can . I 'll take care of the mess at the estaurant .
GELLER: The Trout Farm is owned by Cortical Systematics ?
NOURISH: Yes .
BITTERLY: Their corporate slogan should be , `` Enemies of Reality '' .
SOTTO VOCE: Where did that come from ?
PIKUL: The game made me do it .
GELLER: I 'm impressed .
PASSIONATE: We love you two now , now that you have proven to be true and trustworthy Realists . We 'll be in touch .
PIKUL: `` Enemies of Reality '' ? Or does it eally mean , enemies of eXistenZ ? Are the Realists the game-life version of the Anti- eXistenZialists , desperately want to kill you ?
GELLER: I would n't take it too seriously .
PIKUL 1: Of course you would n't . But maybe you should .
PAUSE: But why is the name Cortical Systematics familiar ?
GELLER: We saw it everywhere in Dorsey Nader 's game store , remember ?
PIKUL: Yes . So that makes it the game- life version of our own company . Cortical Systematics is equivalent to Antenna Research in the real world .
GELLER: That 's probably fair to say .
PIKUL: So , then , do we meekly go back to work and say nothing ? It sounds as though Nourish and his Realists are preparing to sabotage the Trout Farm . Before you know it , they 'll be planning to assassinate game designers .
GELLER: We 're just characters in here . Do n't mix your real-life loyalties into it or you 'll lose for sure .
PIKUL: Then what do we do next ?
GELLER: I 'm looking for Dorsey Nader . Is he here ?
CASHIER: Say that again ?
GELLER: Is Dorsey Nader here ?
CASHIER: Come with me . He 's in the back .
PIKUL: Migod !
GELLER: What happened ?
CASHIER: You should n't have killed the Chinese waiter .
PIKUL: Why not ?
CASHIER: He was your contact at the Trout Farm . A damn good man . His dog brought me this .
PIKUL: But we were contacted there by Yevgeny Nourish . He seemed to know exactly who we were .
CASHIER: That 's because Nader tipped him off that you were coming . Nade was a mole for Cortical Systematics .
GELLER: You 're with the Realist underground .
CASHIER: Yes . I was placed here to keep an eye on Nader . The cashier puts the gun back on the shelf .
PIKUL: If Nourish is n't our real contact , who is he ?
CASHIER: Nourish is a double agent fo Cortical Systematics . He was working with Nader to subvert the Realist cause , and doing it ather well .
SNORTS CONTEMPTUOUSLY: After all , he got you to assassinate your own contact . But now you 're going to put a stop to him .
PIKUL: We are ?
CASHIER: I assume that you both have had spinal port inserts , bioports , installed .
PIKUL: We do .
PASSIONATE: Do you both realize that neithe of you can be buried on hallowed ground because of these these mutilations ? Does your bioport manual tell you that ?
GELLER: Are you trying to talk us into having them removed ?
CASHIER: No , no . In fact , you would be useless to us without them . We Realists are forbidden to have them , and so we have to use people like you on occasion .
GELLER: I do n't understand . Are you wanting us to jack a game into our bioports ?
CASHIER: Game ? No . Not a game . A weapon . You go back to the Trout Farm , and in a familiar place , you find a mouldy old wicker basket with a thread-bare canvas cover .
PIKUL: How will we know what to do ?
CASHIER: Even a child would know what to do .
GELLER: Come on in .
VINOKUR: ..and when we got no answer , I figured you were playing eXistenZ to try out your new pod , and you new bioport . Everything 's all ight , I take it ?
GELLER: Thanks so much , Kiri . This is very sweet of you .
AWKWARD PAUSE: So I take it she has .
GELLER: Has what ?
VINOXUR: Recovered . eXistenZ .
GELLER: Oh , yes , sure . That 's why we 're so spaced out .
TO PIKUL: We were right into it , were n't we ?
PIKUL: Yeah , we were . And it 's amazing .
VINOKUR: Well , that 's a relief . I 'll leave you two alone . You can leave the tray outside your door when you 're finished .
PIKUL: What is that you 've brought ?
VINOKUR: Believe it or not , it 's Chinese food . There 's a great Chinese estaurant on the other side of the escarpment road . Vinokur turns to go .
GELLER: Kiri ?
VINOKUR: Yes ?
GELLER: Have you heard anything yet ? I mean , about the eXistenZ test seminar and the shooting ?
VINOKUR: Oh , yes . It 's come over all the media now . You 've never been more famous . Your face is everywhere , which of course just.makes it worse . I
GELLER: What ? Tell me .
VINOKUR: They 've announced the possibility that Antenna will delay the elease of your new system indefinitely , until they can determine how widespread support for this fanatical group really is . I do n't approve , myself . I do n't think we should bend one degree to extremists .
GELLER: Support for the fanatics ? What does that mean ?
VINOKUR: Well , you know . They 're all coming out of the woodwork now .
GELLER: Who is ?
VINOKUR: A lot of people are taking the opportunity to jump on the anti- game bandwagon . They 've now heard umours about what the eXistenZ system is , and they say we 've gone too far psychologically , medically , socially , you name it . And I 'm afraid I would n't put it past our competitors to be involved in this , to try to whip up public opinion and kill ou new system before it gets born .
PAUSE: You 're sure you do n't want me to contact Antenna , even just to see what they have to say ?
SHAKEN: Not yet , Kiri . Thanks . Vinokur smiles gently and leaves .
PIKUL: ( gesturing towards the
DOOR: Your friend Vinokur is getting shaky . I think he 's going to turn , you in to Antenna .
GELLER: Sounds like you might approve of that .
PIKUL: It might be the safest thing . Are you hungry ?
GELLER: Are you kidding ?
PIKUL: Me neither . I 'm terrified to look under the plates .
PAUSE: This `` support for the fanatics '' thing does n't sound too good . Maybe we should stop
GELLER: We ca n't stop . I 've been noticing some new glitches . I 'm not sure what they mean . I 'm not sure the game is OK .
GENTLY: Listen , to be honest , I find you game very confusing . I 'm not sure I want to go back in there , ecause I 'm not convinced I 'm going to keep coming out . Do you eally like that feeling ?
WITH PASSION: Yeah , I love it .
DELICIOUSLY MUSING: When eXistenZ is released , it 's gon na wipe the competition off the face of the earth .
PIKUL: Will it ?
GELLER: It really will do that , yes .
HEAVY PAUSE: Do n't hurt me , Pikul . Do n't make me go back in alone . Play with me .
PIKUL: Allegra , I 'm worried that you game will wipe me off the face of the earth . I 'm thinking I was ight never to have a bioport installed .
GELLER: But you have one now . And you 're ported in .
PIKUL: That was cruel . I do n't want to e here .
GELLER: It was n't cruel , it was desperate . C'mon , Pikul . You 've just got a bad case of first-time user anxiety .
PIKUL: I do n't like it here . I do n't know what 's going on . We 're lundering around together in this unformed world , whose rules and objectives are largely unknown , seemingly indecipherable , or even Possibly non-existent , always on the verge of being killed by forces we do n't understand .
GELLER: That sounds like my game , all ight .
PIKUL: That sounds like a game that 's not going to be easy to market .
LAUGHS: But it 's a game that everybody 's already playing ! Existence , it 's wonderful !
PIKUL: The cashier said it would be in a familiar place . Is there such a thing here ?
GELLER: My assembly bay .
PIKUL: Is that it over there ?
GELLER: I 'd say it 's exactly as advertised .
PIKUL: God , it 's ugly . Even for a game- pod .
PAUSE: I have a terrible urge to port into it . What about you ?
PIKUL: Oh , sure . Yes . Desperate to port into it .
GELLER: Here we go . Wan na give me a hand ?
HORRIFIED: You 're not serious ! I mean , that 's a diseased pod ! Once you port into that , you become , you you
GELLER: Exactly . Help me .
PIKUL: How long does it take for the infection to take hold ?
GELLER: No time at all .
PIKUL: And then you quietly port into all the other pods and spread the infection to them
GELLER: Oh , God !
PIKUL: What 's happening ?
SUPPORTING HER: I 'm gon na unport you now .
GELLER: 0 , God , do n't ! That really hurts !
RISING: I 'm going to cut you free !
GELLER: No , do n't , I 'm afraid !
GELLER C: Pikul . I 'm bleeding to death .
TERRIFIED: I 'm sorry ! I do n't know what else to do !
NOURISH: I know what to do .
HORRIFIED: No , no !
DYING: Death death to the demoness Barb Brecken to the
PIKUL: Death to who ? Oh , yeah Barb
PIKUL: Allegra , we 're back home . What 's the matter , what 's wrong ?
BARELY COHERENT: Pikul . It 's here , it 's happened . It 's come back here with us . We ought it back with us from eXistenZ .
PIKUL: Brought what back ? I ca n't understand what you 're saying .
WITH CLARITY: We brought the disease back with us . My pod is diseased .
GELLER: Oh God , I 'm really going to lose it , I 'm going to lose my game ! Unport me ! C'mon , unport me !
TO POD: I 'm coming , I 'm coming !
PIKUL: But this ca n't be possible . How can a game event emerge into real life ?
PANICKING: There 's a very weird reality- leed-through effect happening here . I 'm not sure I get it . Pikul finally gets his UmbyCord unplugged .
PIKUL: What 's in that needle ?
GELLER: It 's an anti-viral serum . It sometimes works if you get it in time .
PIKUL: What ?
GELLER: Lem me see it !
PIKUL: Vinokur ?
GELLER: He gave you a new bioport , did n't he ?
PIKUL: Oh , no .
GELLER: He gave you an infected bioport so that my pod would die and so would my game-system .
PIKUL: I 'm infected ? Wait a minute !
IN TEARS: The poor thing was trying to tell us that it was sick by introducing the theme of disease into our game .
PIKUL: The theme of disease ? I 'm fucking eall infected ! Is it going to crawl up my spine and rot my ain ?
GELLER: All right , do n't panic . I 've got something that will help you .
PIKUL: Yeah , great . Now , listen . This could be critical . Were you eally saying that Vinokur is an
WAILING: Oh , God ! Pikul , my pod 's dying .
WAILING: I ca n't help it ! I ca n't do anything for it ! Geller falls to her knees beside the pod .
SCREAMS: The uprising has begun ! The whole place is on fire ! Let 's go ! You 've got to get out of here . They 'll be looking for you .
TO GELLER: The cashier ? He 's a game character ! How can he be here ?
GELLER: I do n't know ! I do n't know !
CASHIER: Leave that rotting piece of meat here . It 's done its job . Let it die .
GELLER: But my game ! My game 's inside it . I do n't want my game to die .
PIKUL: Allegra , listen to me . I think we 're still inside the game . I think your real pod 's out there somewhere , somewhere safe . I think it 's OK to let go of this one , this pod . It 's not the real one .
CASHIER: Everybody out ! now !
PIKUL: What is it that we 're seeing ?
GLEEFUL: The victory of Realism . And you were part of it .
DESOLATE: The death of eXistenZ . And we were part of it .
CASHIER: There 's just one more thing .
HORRIFIED: What are you doing ? We 're on you side .
FIERCE: How could you be ? How could Allegra Geller , the world 's premiere game designer , be on ou side ? ( off their bewildered
LOOKS: Oh , Y93 . ' We know who you are . You ca n't hide inside a game forever .
PIKUL: Something 's slipped over the edge , here , Allegra . Something 's all wrong .
SMILES: There . You see what I mean . You see the problem .
VINOKUR: I tried to find you . Thank God I got here in time . My dog brought me this .
BACKING AWAY: You did n't get here in time . My game is dead .
FOCUSSING: You murdered my game .
LAUGHS: No , just your pod . I replicated the entire contents of your pod when I fixed your nerve boards . They 're in safe-keeping . They 're all in one piece .
GELLER: You copied eXistenZ ?
VINOKUR: Allegra , come over to Cortical Systematics . Yes , yes , Cortical Systematics . I 'm defecting and so are all the Antenna Research top ass , Pellatt , Melzack , Sherrin , everybody good .
GELLER: You 're a spy for Cortical Systematics .
CONFUSED: Wait a minute . Cortical Systematics is just the qame version , it 's only
TIGNORING PIKUL: Not a spy , exactly . I think of myself as a personnel exchange engineer . If you want to be eunited with your creation , you 'll come over to us . eXistenZ , y Allegra Geller . Only from Cortical Systematics .
DEFIANT: Only from Antenna Research .
VINOKUR: But why stay with them ? Look at that mess down there . How could you trust Antenna again , when they 've endangered you like this ?
GELLER: You know , this guy was actually going to kill me . Vinokur looks to Pikul for support .
TO PIKUL: Can you talk to her ? I mean , we can take you with us too .
PIKUL: What the fuck are you doing ? ! You 've killed him ! Are you gon na kill me next ?
LAUGHS GIDDILY: C'mon , Pikul . He 's only a game character . And I did n't like the way he was messing with my mind .
SUDDENLY CALM: Did n't you ? You did n't like that and so you killed him ?
GELLER: He was only a game character .
QUIETLY: But Allegra . What if we 're not in the game anymore ?
GELLER: Huh ? If if we we 're not ?
STRANGELY HARD: If we 're not , then you just killed someone real . A real person .
PAUSE: You see what can happen . It 's important for me that you see that .
GELLER: Why ?
PIKUL: It was n't an accident that you and I ended up on the run together .
GELLER: Not an accident ? Pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands .
PIKUL: No .
COLD: That 's why you never had a ioport . You were one of them .
PIKUL: I still am one of them .
GELLER: But you have a bioport now .
IRONIC: I thought that was forbidden to Anti-eXistenZialists .
PIKUL: I made the bioport sacrifice to get close to you , to make love to my enemy .
GELLER: Why would you do that ?
PIKUL: To understand what I have to kill .
QUIETLY: Then . understand this .
GELLER: Understand that I suspected who you were from the moment you made that fake phone call to yourself in the limo . Understand that I knew you were my real assassin when you pointed the gun at me in the Chinese restaurant .
GLEEFUL: Death to the demon Ted Pikul !
GELLER: Have I won the game ? Have I won ? Have I won ?
MERLE: Are you all back ?
NOURISH: We 're back , Merle . Although I have a feeling some of our crew might not realize it yet . Shaky laughter from some of the players .
WAITER: Wow . Anybody here want a bowl of hot and sour soup ?
VINOKUR: I will , if you make sure there
FEMALE ASSISTANT: How long were we gone ?
MERLE: About twenty minutes .
DICHTER: It seemed like days . That 's fantastic .
FEMALE ASSISTANT: Yeah . If you stayed in the gameworld for most of your life , you could live to be five hundred years old !
CASHIER: The twists and turns at the end made my head spin . Maybe there were too many , to fast to absorb . Hey , but you two were fantastic . You guys are game divas ! I think you both deserved to win .
GAS: Well me , I was really bummed out at first . I got knocked out of the game so soon . It was fun to watch the rest , though . I liked that part where the ones who got knocked out of the game early got to be spooky customers in the game store .
LEVI: But you were so wonderfully bad . So scary and crazy . I had a lot to do in that first scene in the church but I thought my characte was kind of boring .
GAS: Well , you know , I 'm a gas-jockey in real life , so I was kind of disappointed that I was basically the same thing in the game . A little more fantasy , there , fellers .
NODDING SAGELY: Interesting . Interesting . Hold that thought for the focus group .
FRANCES: Can I keep this ? I 've never felt anything like it ! And I love this little thumb-hole . It 's fantastic ! ( appreciative laughs and
LAUGHS: Nice try , but you 're going to have to turn them in because they 're beta versions , pre- production hand-made specials , and we need to study them afte use for wear and tear and othe things . But you 'll get a certificate for helping us out here - I 'm right about that , are n't I , Merle ?
NODDING ENTHUSIASTICALLY: And that will entitle you to eserve one of the first batch of the TranscendenZ by PilgrImage game modules to hit the market , and at a seriously discounted price . You 're gon na love it .
MERLE: Remember - it 's written like this . Capital T , capital Z. TranscendenZ . It 's new , it 's from Pilgrimage - capital P. capital I , and it 's coming soon .
SHYLY: I 'd just like to say thank you to Mr. Nourish for giving me the chance to play the role of a sta designer . I guess the game picked up on my ambitions to be like you .
NOURISH: well , let me first say that I 'm kinda glad I lost this game . I do n't usually play such nasty characters .
LAUGHTER: And , Allegra , you were so good in that role that I suspect it wo n't e long before PilgrImage is after you to sign a designing contract . And maybe you should take you friend Ted , here , Mr. Pikul , with you . He 's obviously good in a crisis , and when you design games , there are plenty of them .
GELLER: I guess you all could tell that Ted and I had a relationship prior to our coming here . We eally do like to play together .
PIKUL: We do , but I 'd like to assure everybody here that Allegra would n't really jump into bed with a security guard unless he was me . ( laughs from the security
MERLE: Well , what do we say to ou illiant , award-winning game designer , Yevgeny Nourish ? Does he have another winner on his hands or not ?
MERLE: All right , now , I have to ask you some questions , before the game half-life wears off . First , let me thank you for taking part in this test seminar . PilgrImage wants to deliver nothing but the finest to the game enthusiast , and you have all been a proud part of that process tonight . When we 've collected all the head-sets and game modules , we 'll e handing out a questionnaire to each of you , and I 'd like you answers to the questions to be as honest , as brutal , as clear as you can make them . Do n't hold ack . After that , we 're going to form a focus group where we 'll discuss details of each of you experiences playing TranscendenZ . You 've all had different but interlocking lives in the game , and I think you 'll be amazed when you hear each other 's stories .
MERLE: What do you mean ?
NOURISH: It had a very strong , very real anti-game theme . I mean , it began with the assassination of a game designer .
MERLE: or Really ? But that 's very creative .
PAUSE: But on second thought , I see what you mean . It makes me nervous . You think it must have come from one of our game players ?
NOURISH: It sure did n't come from me . The tone of it in the game was very , very passionate , fanatical . And the atmosphere of paranoia and etrayal was overwhelming . The whole thing felt unstable , dangerous , volatile . But worse than that , there was a kind of industrial espionage subplot . Stealing game-systems , jumping ship from one game company to another . That kind of thing .
MERLE: So which one of them did these elements come from ?
NOURISH: Let 's probe it when we do the focus group . I think we might have been infiltrated here , and if we have , we 've got a big security problem .
PIKUL: Hi . We were just wondering if we could ask Mr. Nourish a question , away from all the others .
NOURISH: Sure . Shoot .
CHUCKLES: Long as you do n't ask me to fill in your questionnaire .
NO CHUCKLES: We 've played your game now , and so we can finally agree with the others that you are the world 's greatest game artist .
OMINOUSLY: We were n't sure before .
SMILE: Well , thank you so much .
NO SMILE: Yevgeny , do n't you think you should suffer for all the harm you 've done , and intend to do , to the human race ?
STUNNED: What ?
PIKUL: Yes . Do n't you think the world 's greatest game artist ought to be punished for the most effective deforming of reality ?
NERVOUSLY: I do n't think this is very ( looks towards security
GUARDS: Boys ? Could you come over here - ight now !
SCREAMS: Death to the demon Yevgeny Nourish !
SCREAMS: Death to PilgrImage ! Death to TranscendenZ !
WAITER: No , wait , you do n't have to shoot me . I just wanted to ask you a question . _
WARY: What ?
INNOCENT: Hey , tell me the truth . Are we still in the game ?
JOEL: You always give me free drinks though . DEAN Oh yeah . Well come by anyway .
STEP: You get this job through Manpower ?
HECTOR: Yeah .
STEP: I started here with Manpower too . Started out on the line just like you .
RORY: My band 's playing this Friday , come check us out .
MARY: You see that That new guy . He 's holding us up . It 's not my job to tell them to hold the line either .
GABRIELLA: And then Joel 's gon na come yell at us , cuz he 's not doing his job .
MARY: I 'm just gon na sit here .
GABRIELLA: You 're not gon na shut it off ?
MARY: I 'm not gon na hold the line . If they 're not gon na do their job , why should I do mine .
JOEL: If I do n't get home before about 8 00 , she puts on the sweatpants and once the sweatpants are on , it 's over I get nothing . ( notices something down
BELOW: Shit . I 'm gon na have to call you ack . Joel hangs up and runs downstairs .
STEP: What are you doing ? !
MARY: What are YOU doing ? ! What is he doing ?
STEP: That 's what I was tryin ' to say .
JOEL: And Step , if you wan na be Floo Manager , this is the kind of thing you 're going to have to deal with .
JOEL: Okay , now Step , Rory , Hector , let 's get this cleaned up , and get olling again . We ca n't afford to fall behind today .
MARY: You see that ? We always get the lame .
JOEL: Jesus They 're like a bunch of goddamned children .
BRIAN: Tell me about it . Sorry I missed the drama ; I was showing boy-genius down there how to back up a forklift .
JOEL: Well , I guess he 's got that band he 's in too
BRIAN: ( disgust at the word
"BAND": `` Band '' , ugh
JOEL: Who , Mary ?
BRIAN: No , the other one what's-her- face she asked me or rathe `` axed '' me for more personal days . Just like that . I told he maybe if she figures out how to fill out the time sheets correctly I 'll give her more personal days Do n't worry , she will never fill out her time sheets correctly .
JOEL: Please go back inside Please just turn around.. .Come ondo n't notice me
TO HIMSELF: Shit !
NATHAN: Hi there Joel ! Glad I caught ya
JOEL: Yeah , actually Nathan , I 'm kind of in a hurry here .
NATHAN: Oh yeah ? You been busy ?

NATHAN: Really ? Why not ? It 's a lot of fun .
JOEL: Oh , I do n't know . Suzie does n't eally like going to stuff like
NATHAN: Why not ?
JOEL: Well , we would n't know anybody there . She get 's kind of uncomfortable .
NATHAN: Oh no It 's not like that . She wo n't be uncomfortable . I guarantee it . No , it 's not like that at all . It 's not formal o anything . Trust me . It 's just a eal loose bunch .
JOEL: I just do n't
NATHAN: I tell you what . Why do n't we do this I 'll go ahead and get tickets , since they 're gon na sell out fast . You talk to Suzie . See what she says . Like I say , she wo n't be uncomfortable at all . Maybe I 'll have Leslie give her a call you know how it is when the wives talk , heh heh Joel is about to snap .
JOEL: Um , why do n't we talk about this later . I got ta make this call before they leave .
CALLING BACK: Sorry I just got ta make this call !
NATHAN: Sorry , I almost forgot the tickets are forty dollars a plate . I know that 's a little steep , but the food is fantastic and it 's fo a good cause . So that 'd be eighty dollars total . There 's no tax o anything .
JOEL: Ah , look Nathan , I really got ta get inside and make this call . Let 's talk about this another time .

UNCOMFORTABLE: Ah , Joel ?
JOEL: What ?
SUZIE: I 'm sorry . It 's just I 'm a little tired , and , I do n't know , it 's the middle of the week
JOEL: It 's not the middle of the week . It 's Monday . Why ca n't
SUZIE: Monday ? ( Freezes , suddenly
REALIZING SOMETHING: Oh shit !
WORRIED: What ? !
SUZIE: Idol !
JOEL: I got ta get a house with a bathroom that 's does n't share a wall with the TV .
DEAN: Why do n't you do that in anothe athroom . You 've got three of 'em .
JOEL: It would look suspicious . We neve use those other bathrooms Maybe if I had some insulation put in
DEAN: Insulation ? All I know is , you should n't move man ; you 've got a nice house . I mean you 've got the American dream really you own your own company . I ca n't believe you used to bar back for me here , and now you 've got all that .
JOEL: But what do I have really ? It 's a ig pain in the ass .
DEAN: Yeah , but he probably lives in a crappy apartment .
JOEL: Hell , I 'd move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom was n't ight next to the TV .
SALESMAN #1: Yeah , it 's expensive but it 's sweet Are you familiar with the Gibson humbucking pickups ?
CINDY: No , sorry . I do n't play . It 's fo my Dad actually for his fiftieth birthday . My sisters and I are all pitching in .
SALESMAN #2: Ah , that 's nice Your Dad would love these humbuckings . They eally kick ass .
MALE CUSTOMER: Excuse me I just have a quick question
OBLIVIOUS: So , what kind of music did he play ?
CINDY: I think he played like , jazz o something . I 'm not sure .
SALESMAN #2: Well this is an excellent jazz guitar . It 's what Pat Metheny plays .
SALESMAN #1: Is your Dad into Metheny at all ?
CINDY: Oh , I do n't know who that is . Sorry .
SALESMAN #2: He 's like , a totally kickass fusion guitarist . Are you into fusion ?
CINDY: I do n't really know much about it
SALESMAN #2: I play fusion guitar so Just curious .
CINDY: Um , do they come in any othe colors ?
SALESMAN #1: You mean different finishes ? There 's a sunburst finish we might have in stock .
SALESMAN #2: Yeah , do you wan na see it ? I 'll go get it .
SALESMAN #1: Or I could go . Whatever .
CINDY: Are you sure ?
SALESMAN #1: Oh shit !
BRIAN: You 're not gon na believe this . Remember the guy from General Mills that called a while back ? Talking like he wanted to buy us out ?
JOEL: I thought you said he was n't serious ; he was just sniffing around .
BRIAN: Yeah , well he 's serious now . He just made an offer I mean a real offer this time .
JOEL: You 're kidding .
BRIAN: No . It must be part of some bigge strategic move , because it 's ove market value I think .
JOEL: Wow
BRIAN: I mean , yeah , there 's a lot of details to work out , but this could e great . They 'll be calling back next week , what should I tell them ?
JOEL: Tell 'em hell yes .
MARY: I already warned him . This is the last time . I 'm just gon na sit here . In SLOW MOTION , we see
JOEL: ( to the person on the
PHONE: Uh-huh Alright . Let me know if you hear anything else . He hangs up , talks to Dean .
DEAN: Wow
JOEL: Yeah I 'm not sure how it happened , but we have a great safety record and we comply with all the safety codes so it was just a freak accident . There 'll be an investigation of some kind I 'm sure .
DEAN: Well , you have insurance for that kind of thing , right ?
JOEL: Oh yeah . Of course . In fact , he 'll probably get a huge settlement .
DEAN: Yeah . I would think so . I mean , it 's your balls
JOEL: Boy it really makes you stop and think about how fragile we are especially our balls . They 're just hanging there in a little sack etween our legs . At any moment they could be cut off forever .
DEAN: Yeah . And your balls are really important man . Your balls are everything . What kind of life would you have with no testicles ? Can you imagine that shit ?
JOEL: Yeah Beat .
DEAN: Wait . Three months ? I thought you said it was once a month .
JOEL: I did ? I must 've been lying . I do n't know Maybe things 'll get etter when I sell the company . I 'll be around more
DEAN: Well , I hope so . That would suck I get laid all the time . Sorry .
JOEL: Ah , it 's all right
THINKS: Actually , it sucks .
DEAN: Yeah , sexual frustration is bad news You know what you oughtta do ?
JOEL: What ?
DEAN: Get some Xanax .
JOEL: Xanax ? Is n't that for anxiety ?
DEAN: Yeah it is , but I find it 's good for just about any phsychological problem . I mean , basically it just makes you feel good , so it sort of works for anything . I even take it when I have a cold . It 's probably great for sexual frustration . Want me to get you some ?
JOEL: No .
DEAN: You know what else is good ? Codeine cough syrup .
JOEL: For what ?
DEAN: It 's just good . Joel looks at Dean for a beat .
QUIETLY: You could probably get a bette deal at a music store .
CINDY: Oh , that 's okay . Thanks . But I just kind of wan na get it ove with , you know ? It 's kind of hard for me .
BRIAN: So obviously Step 's not coming back anytime soon . I had to hire a couple temps . Is that okay ?
JOEL: Yeah , sure . How is Step ?
BRIAN: Better . They say he 's going home in a couple of days . Speaking of which , the guys at General Mills heard about this whole Step thing . They 're worried . If Step decides to sue us beyond the insurance settlement it could be a serious liability . They do n't want to make an offer until this thing has settled .
JOEL: Really ? They think it 's that big of a liability ?
BRIAN: Well yeah . Do n't you ? I mean , think about it . Imagine if you asked a bunch of jurors how much you 'd have to pay 'em to cut thei alls off ? I mean , I would n't let someone cut my balls off for a illion dollars . Seriously unless there were some kind of eally expensive operation that could give you artificial balls o something . Would you ?
JOEL: No , I guess not .
BRIAN: Anyway , I would n't worry . He says he 's not going to sue us . Says he
CRUDE IMITATION: `` do n't want somethin ' fer nothin `` ' and `` What 's right is right . '' If we can just get him to sign something to that effect we should be fine .
JOEL: Boy , Step sure is being mellow about all this .
BRIAN: Yeah , well I think when you lose your balls it mellows you out . You do n't get as pissed off and aggressive about things . I know it 's true for horses , and bulls .
JOEL: Boy , it sure does make you think..
BRIAN: Oh , by the way , guess who asked fo a raise today ?
JOEL: Who ?
GESTURES INDISCRIMINATELY: to someone downstairs ) Dinkus . Can you believe that ?
JOEL: Brian , you call everyone here `` Dinkus . '' I do n't know who you 're talking about .
BRIAN: You know , Forklift-Dinkus ?
JOEL: Oh I thought you call him `` boy- genius . ''
BRIAN: Yeah , well boy-genius asked for a aise . I said , `` are you kidding ? You nearly got someone killed last week , '' and then he blamed it on Dinkus over there .
JOEL: You know Brian , you really ought to learn the employees ' names .

DEAN: Manpower , huh ? Maybe I should give them a call . You do n't usually have girls anywhere near that hot working here . What 's the deal ?
JOEL: Yeah , I know . I guess it makes sense though if you think about it . Hot girls need a job just as much as anyone else .
DEAN: Do they really ? Huh You just do n't see 'em here . Usually you temps look like winos . And they 're guys .
JOEL: You wan na hear something really weird ?
DEAN: What ?
JOEL: She came on to me .

JOEL: Well , first she started asking me about what happened to Step and all that stuff you know , just sort of making conversation ?
DEAN: Yeah .
JOEL: But it really seemed like she was flirting with me , you know ?
DEAN: Really ? How ?
JOEL: Well , you see that guy down there y the fork lift ?
DEAN: Wow . So , you gon na do anything about it ?
JOEL: What ? No . No way . I could n't live with myself if I cheated on Suzie It 'd be nice if I got laid at home once in a while though
DEAN: Man , she is fine . You mind if I hit that then ? Beat .
JOEL: Yeah , I do sort of
MARY: My purse is stolen ! It 's gone ! He did it ! He stole my purse !
BRIAN: Now hold on
MARY: I wo n't hold on ! I 'll call the cops !
HECTOR: What ? I don ' No comprende
HORRIBLE SPANISH: Espera un momento Hector . Tu sabes donde esta su uh , purse ?
JOEL: Now wait a second . Calm down Mary . How do you know it was stolen ?
MARY: It 's gone ! That 's how .
JOEL: Well , what did it look like .
MARY: It was black with a fur , leopard style border As Mary describes the purse , we
STEP: You can go ahead of me if that 's all you have .
SWEETLY: Thank you so much . I ca n't believe I 'm buying this stuff I work at the factory .
STEP: Really ? I work there too . Or , ah , I used to .
CINDY: Really ? You 're kidding ! I just started there . What 's your name ?
STEP: I go by Step . Yeah , I 'm the fastest sorter there As Cindy and Step get to know each other we
JOEL: I 'm sick of it Dean . I 'm sick of eing turned down in my own house y my own wife . We 're turning into one of those brother-siste couples .
DEAN: HuhNow that you mention it , you guys kind of look alike too .
GROSSED OUT: No we do n't !
DEAN: Okay .
JOEL: Maybe things will be better after I sell the company Or maybe it 's just going to mean more time to sit around and contemplate not getting laid . Dean nods sympathetically .
DEAN: What about that girl at work ? She still into you ?
JOEL: Yeah she was really coming on to me . She gave me her phone numbe and everything . Told me to call her if I wanted to go to that party . Can you believe that ? And there 's nothing I can do about it , ut just be sexually frustrated .
DEAN: I 've got some Xanax if you want it . Like I say , that always works fo me .
JOEL: No thanks
DEAN: Well maybe you should call that girl .
JOEL: No , I ca n't . I ca n't cheat on Suzie . I just got ta power through it until I 'm so old that I ca n't get it up anymore .
DEAN: What about if Suzie cheated on you ?
JOEL: Hmm I had n't even thought of that
BEAT: I wish she would .
DEAN: You wish she would cheat on you ? Would n't that bother you ? Joel thinks about it .
JOEL: No . I do n't think it would actually . I guess that 's weird huh ?
DEAN: Yeah , it 's a little weird . Sort of .
JOEL: But see , then I could do something about all this sexual frustration , without feeling guilty about it .
DEAN: Do you think she would cheat on you ?
JOEL: Nah
DEAN: You sure ?
CONSIDERS IT: Well , I do n't know . Hmm Maybe if she were really tempted she would . Like if some really studly guy came on to her .
DEAN: So you 're saying she would probably cheat on you if she was put in temptation 's way ?
JOEL: Yeah , maybe .
DEAN: You know what you oughtta do ?
WEARY: I do n't wan na do any drugs Dean .
DEAN: No , no . Check this out If you eally wish your wife would cheat on you , it 's not that hard to make it happen .
JOEL: How ?
DEAN: Hire a gigolo to have an affai with your wife .
JOEL: What ?
DEAN: I 'm serious . I know a guy .
INCREDULOUS: You know a gigolo ?
DEAN: Yeah .
JOEL: How do you know a gigolo ?
DEAN: This guy Brad . He comes in here all the time . He 's a friend of Vic 's . You could hire him to have an affair with Suzie .
JOEL: Come on Dean .
DEAN: Why not ? You said you would n't care if she cheated on you . Then you 'd be free to go out with that Cindy chick and get your ya-yas out with no guilt . Problem solved . Man , what a great idea . Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing .
JOEL: You know , maybe I will try some of that Xanax .
STEP: I just believe that what 's ight is right .
CINDY: That 's right Step , and what 's right is for you to send a message .
STEP: A message ?
CINDY: You need to send a message so that a horrible accident like this neve happens to anyone else ever again . That 's what 's right . And the way you do that is to take them to court .
STEP: You think ?
CINDY: Yes Step That 's why I called a lawyer for you that guy on all the bus stop benches .
STEP: Joe Adler ?
TOUCHED: You did that for me ?
CINDY: Mmm hmm I just want you to do what 's right Step .
STEP: No he did n't .
CINDY: Maybe it was your lawyer , but he talked to your doctor . And you doctor said it 's very important not to get aroused until after the trial I 'm sorry .
STEP: That 's okay You 're so good to me Cindy . They start cuddling again .
CINDY: Look Step , you 're getting me turned on , I 'm getting you turned on I etter just go .
DEAN: Shit Do you remember what colo that pill I gave you was ?
JOEL: Huh ?
DEAN: Damn . I do n't think it was Xanax . I think that might 've been Ritalin Or `` Special K . ''
JOEL: Ah , who cares ?
DEAN: It 's just that , ah , Special K is a horse tranquilizer , kinda has a weird effect when people take it ut well , do n't worry about it You might not want to drink too much more though .
JOEL: ( beginning to slur his
SPEECH: You know that thing you were talking about ? About the gigolo ?
DEAN: Yeah ?
JOEL: Do you think it would be wrong to do that ? I mean morally wrong ?
DEAN: Oh nooo . Definitely not . What could be morally wrong about it ?
JOEL: I do n't know
DEAN: Look , if she does n't want to go fo it , she does n't have to . And if she does , then she 's the one who sinned , and then it 's perfectly morally right for you to go out and off whoever you want .
SLURRED SPEECH: Yeah , I guess you 're right . I ca n't think of anything morally wrong about it either . Beat .
JOEL: And this guy , he 's a friend of yours ? What 's his name ?
DEAN: Brad . You want me to give him a call ?
JOEL: I do n't know . It 's kinda weird even talking about it .
DEAN: Look , this is no big deal Joel . I 'm serious .
JOEL: Really ?
DEAN: Yeah . I mean , you ca n't lose . Just say you 're hiring him to come clean the pool or something . See what happens . If she does n't go for it , then at least you know you 're doing the right thing by being faithful .
JOEL: Yeah , I guess you 're right I do n't know . It 's crazy . Dean pours Joel another drink .
DEAN: Look . Have another drink . Think about it You know what ? Why do n't I just call Brad and see what he has to say ?
JOEL: Alright . What the hell . Joel takes a big swig of liquor .
BRAD: Yeah , two-hundred .
DEAN: Well yeah , but do n't forget , I 'm getting ten percent .
JOEL: What , so you 're a pimp now ?
CONDESCENDING CHUCKLE: I do n't think they 're called `` pimps '' when it 's with male prostitutes , okay . There 's some other word for it it 's not a `` john , '' but it 's something like that . Besides , I 'm the one who hooked all this up . And do n't worry 'cuz it 's coming out of Brad 's money anyway .
JOEL: Alright , alright .
TO BRAD: So it 's two-hundred dollars then ?
DEAN: Two-hundred and twenty .
JOEL: Wait a minute
BRAD: Um , I have a question ?
JOEL: Yeah ? Brad looks at Joel , deeply concerned .
BRAD: So like , are you gon na , like , watch or something ?
JOEL: No no no . God no ! It 's not like that . I wo n't even be there . I 'll e at work . Remember ? We already talked about this . Brad looks blank , like he 's not getting it .
BRAD: So , uh , you 're not gon na touch my ass or anything ?
JOEL: NO ! Try to pay attention okay ? I will not be there . I will be at work . You come over to my house while I 'm not there , posing as the new pool cleaner and then try to seduce her Brad finally makes a breakthrough .
BRAD: Oooh , I see . Sorry man . Yeah , yeah . I get it now . You 're not even gon na be there
JOEL: Yeah , that 's right .
BRAD: Yeah cool . No problem . This is gon na be great !
JOEL: Remember , she might not go for it Brad starts to get a little too excited .
BRAD: Yeah , this is gon na be cool ! I can hardly wait ! Awesome . Hey man , if you know anyone else who needs you know what I do , like you know , lonely housewives and shit , maybe you could tell 'em about me , you know
DEAN: Referrals .
BRAD: Yeah yeah , those things . Then those women could tell more women and then it 'd be like I was , like , uh branching or..
DEAN: Networking .
BRAD: Yeah , networking ! Totally . Then if I got enough of 'em , maybe I could quit my landscaping job and do this full time . That would be awesome ! Cause I hate landscaping . I like getting laid a lot better , and my boss is a total dick
DEAN: Okay , you 've said that a few times now Brad . Go on to your car . Okay ?
BRAD: Alright . Cool . Like I say
DEAN: Goodnight Brad .
BRAD: Okay . See you later . Brad finally leaves .

JOEL: I think Step is just chest-beating . He does this all the time . He gets all wound up , talks big , then he always backs down . And that 's with his balls .
PAROLE OFFICER: I 'm sorry to even bring this up , ut you 're not living with the drug dealer anymore are you ?
CINDY: Nope . I 'm staying at Extended Stay until I can find a place She smiles , flirtatiously waves her key/card .

ALMOST BLUSHING: It 's okay . I 'm just glad to see you 're doing so well Ah , one more thing I just need to ask you We had a little incident up in Templeton a couple weeks back where someone stole an expensive guita from a music store ? Someone who fit your description . You know anything about that ?
CINDY: Huh ? No I was probably at work that day .
PAROLE OFFICER: Look Cindy , you realize you ca n't screw up anymore right ? I mean , even something minor , and you could go back to jail for a while this time . I 'd hate to see that happen .
CINDY: Well yeah , but why would I steal a guitar ? I 've got no musical talent . I 'm tone deaf . They both laugh .
PAROLE OFFICER: Heh heh , So am I. I ca n't carry a tune to save my life .
CINDY: Really ? Wow

DEAN: Yeah , I 'm tellin ' ya , chicks really go wild for that Brad Sorry .
JOEL: No , you 're right . He may be a stupid , dull-witted moron , but he can get any girl he wants . Me , I had to work for it . I had to work hard , get a career going , take Suzie out a bunch of times , marry her . But not Brad . He gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that . Oh , and by the way ? That little prick was at my house again today .
DEAN: No shit ? What was he doing ?

BRAD: No Dude , please do n't . Please ? Joel starts back to his car .
JOEL: Do n't mess it up ? ! You 're talking about my wife ! My house ! Stupid- ass ! Joel gets in his car and starts it .
BRAD: Dude , you ca n't do this to me .
JOEL: Oh yes I can
SUZIE: Oh hi . You 're home early .
COLD: Hi .
JOEL: So how was that new pool cleaner ?
SUZIE: Um What do you mean ?
JOEL: What do you think I mean ? Did he do a good job cleaning the pool ?
SUZIE: Ah well
JOEL: Did he get all the leaves ? It does n't really look that clean . I mean I 'm looking at it , and I 'd say it 's pretty goddamn filthy . Did the guy even clean it at all ? It sure does n't look like it .
NERVOUS: Well yeah , I guess he did n't do a very good job .
JOEL: I think he did a horrible job . I do n't think we should use him anymore .
SUZIE: Okay .
JOEL: Okay .
SUZIE: Are you all right , Joel ? You want an aspirin or anything ?
JOEL: No .
STEP: Wow , I do n't think you 've ever been to my house before . Have you ?
JOEL: Yeah , I do n't think so . I would 've emembered
STEP: This is my half brother Phil .
JOEL: Hi Hey Step , can we talk in another room .
STEP: Sure , let 's go out back .
BEAT: You 're not here to try to talk me out of suing are you ?
JOEL: Oh , no No , I 'm just kind of curious about ah So you 've een going out with Cindy , huh ?
STEP: Yes sir . She 's my girlfriend . We might even get married after all this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets worked out .
JOEL: .so some of the guys at work are saying you gave Cindy that black eye .
STEP: What ? That ai n't true at all .
JOEL: Yeah , I know it 's not .
STEP: She got it from falling down some stairs .
JOEL: Hmm Look , you might wan na be careful with Cindy .
DEFENSIVE: What do you mean ?
JOEL: Well , I 'm not sure how to put this , ut You know , you got a lot of money coming your way with this settlement . You might wan na be
STEP: Oh no . No , she did n't even know about that 'til after we started going out .
JOEL: You sure about that ?
STEP: Oh yeah . I did n't tell her about it for a while 'cuz I was kind of embarrassed , you know ? You do n't tell a girl you just met that you lost one of your balls . Especially a girl as hot as Cindy .
JOEL: Yeah
DELICATELY: You know she lives with this guy Willie right ?
STEP: That 's her ex . She broke up with him . She 's gon na move out . She just needs to get all her stuff outta there .
JOEL: You sure about that ?
STEP: Oh yeah . She 's moving in with me .
JOEL: Oh . Hmm
STEP: Look , I know Cindy 's got some problems , but she means well . She 's the best thing that eve happened to me .
JOEL: Well , okay If you say so . Another thing you just might want to watch your back . Some of the guys at work who think you gave Cindy the black eye were talking about paying you a visit you know , getting even .
STEP: Oh . Well I 'm not worried about that . I could kick anyone 's ass at that whole company .
SUZIE: No Brad , we ca n't . I 'm sorry , but we have to stop doing this .
BRAD: Why ?
SUZIE: It 's not right . I feel horrible . Besides , I think Joel 's getting suspicious . And you got ta start cleaning the pool too .
BRAD: But I 've never felt this way about anyone before . And I 've been with a lot of chicks .
TURNED OFF: Uh-huh Look Brad , the truth is I love my husband . I really do . This was all a big mistake . I 'm sorry . I do n't know what got into me , but we have to stop this . I want to make my marriage work again . I 'm going to tell Joel about the whole thing and just hope he forgives me . And even if he does n't , at least I wo n't be carrying around this horrible feeling . I just ca n't stand that he does n't know .
BRAD: Uh This does n't mean we ca n't still see each other though , right ?
SUZIE: Ah , yes it does .
BRAD: Why ?
SUZIE: Because of all the things I just said .
PATIENTLY: Do you need me to say them again ?
BRAD: Can I see you tomorrow ?
SUZIE: No .
PLEADING: How about next week ?
SUZIE: No . Look , you got ta go Brad . Joel could be home any second .
BRAD: I 'll call you tomorrow .
SUZIE: ( just trying to get rid of
HIM: Okay . Okay , just go and we 'll talk later .
TO HERSELF: God , what a moron .
BRIAN: So you ready ?
JOEL: Huh ?
BRIAN: The meeting with Step 's lawyer . O lawyers I should say . It 's today emember ?
JOEL: Oh shit Alright . Joel drags himself out of the chair .
ADLER: .You see , if both his balls had een knocked clean off , he would be a good case , but not a great case A man with no balls is no man at all . He 's a freak . He 's barely human . He 's gross . And a jury will never feel like they can walk in the shoes of a ball-less , neutered , he/she freak . But Step . He 's still got one ball - barely . He 's still a man . A man who 's very manhood has been jeopardized , but still a man . And that manhood , that very sense of what you are as a human being is hanging by a thread . Jesus , you ca n't get more dramatic than that . That brave all , hanging on for dear life , hanging on for justice , is going to e the hero of this trial . I 'm tellin ' ya this Step guy is the fuckin ' Holy Grail , the Powerball Jackpot . And you all laughed at me when I bought those bus bench ads . But I knew the asses of those poo slobs that sit on those benches and ide those sweaty , stinking , cattle cars are our future . And I Joel and Brian walk in .
RORY: .And when they sell the company , Joel and Brian are gon na be the one 's who get rich , and
MARY: And we 're the ones doing all the work .
GABRIELLE: That 's right .
RORY: It 's bullshit man . We should get a piece of it . I work my ass off .
MARY: Gabrielle and I work harder than anybody . I should be making what Brian makes . If you add up all the crates I move , I lift 10,000 pounds a day . Minimum .
GABRIELLE: That 's right . Here he 's gon na make a million dollars , and we 're the ones who do everything . I went to college . For three years .
MARY: If we quit , this place could n't un . They would n't be able to sell this place for anything .
JIM: That 's why what we should do is , is we should all go on strike demand stock in the company before it sells . If General Mills knew we were on strike , they would n't uy this place until the strike was over . That way they 'd have to give us stock .
RORY: That 's right man . We should do it . We should strike .
MARY: That 's right . I could get a job at Gemco like that . At Gemco , all the employees are owners even says so on the name tags .
GABRIELLE: Mmm hmm . I could get a job at Southwest Airlines
ADLER: Ok gentlemen . We 've gone through everything and the only way we would even begin to consider a settlement would be to the tune of the number you see on the bottom of page 18 . Does everyone have this ?
JOEL: What ! ! ! ? We do n't have this much money ! Not even close !
ADLER: Not in cash you do n't . Of course not . But if you were to sell off your assets the property lease , the equipment , the
JOEL: What the ff Are you shitting me ! ? That would bankrupt us !
BRIAN: This is what I 've been trying to tell you Joel
JOEL: If you think I 'm just going to give up this entire company that I built from the ground up
ADLER: How about what my client gave up ! ? His testicles ! How about that ! ? He walks over to the door
HINGES: and let me slam this door like this Adler SLAMS the door ridiculously hard .
ADLER: Go ahead . We can settle this right now call it even . I will drop this case right now if you let me slam your balls in this door ,
JOEL: It was an accident !
ADLER: Not according to our investigation . We believe that , in fact , there was gross negligence
RORY: I heard those guys up there are the guys from General Mills .
MARY: Mmm hmm
JIM: See , now they 're probably up there negotiating right now cuttin ' up the pie that we baked . That 's what it looks like to me . The employees all nod in agreement .
RORY: We got ta act fast . They could be about to close the deal .
JIM: Yeah , and leave us out in the cold .
RORY: Yeah , then it 's too late . If they 've already sold it we ca n't get a piece of it . We got ta act fast . We need to do one of those walk outs .
JIM: Well , we better do it now .
RORY: Okay , who 's in ? We need a show of force . Come on , it 's now o never
ADLER: Okay then , let me go back to my previous offer I will gladly come down on that price I 'll come all the way down to zero and drop this case if you go over there right now and slam your testicles in that door ! Because
JOEL: I do n't wan na slam my testicles in the door ! I want you to be easonable ! You wo n't even budge one penny ! Come on !
ADLER: Like I say , if you slam your
JOEL: I 'll slam your balls in the door !
ADLER: I 'm sorry , did you just threaten me ?
BRIAN: Look , we need to cool off a minute . We 'll be right back . Brian leads Joel out of the room .
JOEL: I do n't need this . I 'm going home .
RORY: Umm We were just uh
JIM: Well , Rory was talking about how you guys are doing this deal with General Mills and we just think that ah We were considering the idea of ah
RORY: Well , we just think that we should maybe get a piece of it , you know cuz we do all the work And if we do n't um
JOEL: You know what ? Fine . Fine . You 're all in charge all of you . ( gestures to all the
EMPLOYEES: As of now . You run the goddamn place . Go ahead . In fact , you can go up there right now and meet with Adler . He may slam your balls in the door , but woohoo ! You 're the oss !
SUZIE: Listen Joel , there 's something I have to tell you . I think we need to be honest with each other . Suzie sits down .
JOEL: You banged the pool cleaner .
SUZIE: Wha Suzie is stunned .
JOEL: That 's what you 're trying to tell me right ? You had sex with Brad ?
SUZIE: You knew ?
JOEL: Yes I knew . I hired him .
SUZIE: Well I know you hired him , but how did you know about
JOEL: I do n't mean I hired him to clean the pool , I mean I hired him to have sex with you .
SUZIE: What ?
JOEL: He 's a gigolo Suzie . Suzie is stupefied .
SUZIE: But what Why ?
JOEL: I hired him to have an affair with you so that I could have an affai without feeling guilty . I was eally drunk and on some kind of horse tranquilizer and
SUZIE: Brad was getting paid ? So you 've been paying Brad this whole time ? All fifteen times ? !
JOEL: FIFTEEN TIMES ? ! Jesus Christ Suzie ! Joel sinks into his chair , shaking his head .
SUZIE: You wanted to have an affair with another woman ?
JOEL: Yes . But I did n't .
SUZIE: You asshole .
JOEL: Oh , I 'm the asshole ?
SUZIE: Yes ! How could you ?
LAUGHS: How could I ? How could you ? ! ! ! You did n't have to have sex with him . You could 've simply said `` No thanks . Just clean the pool , '' but you did n't , did you ? ! No , you took him up on his little offer and had sex with him fifteen times !
SUZIE: None of this would 've happened if you had n't hired him .
JOEL: Okay . I 'll admit , I made a big mistake . I was drunk , on drugs , stressed , sexually frustrated and I should n't have hired a male prostitute to seduce you . But if you had simply been faithful , none of this would 've happened . Suzie just looks at him for a beat .
SUZIE: You 're sick , you know that ? Beat . Joel ca n't really argue this point .
JOEL: What do you see in Brad anyway ? He 's borderline retarded . You probably could 've been arrested fo having sex with a guy that dumb .
SUZIE: That 's it . I 'm leaving .
JOEL: No . You 're not leaving me . I 'm leaving you !
SUZIE: Fine .
NATHAN: Oh , hey guys . Glad I caught ya . You guys hardly ever answer the door . Heh heh .
SUZIE: Now 's not a good time Nathan .
NATHAN: Oh , you guys goin ' somewhere ?
SUZIE: No . Look , we ca n't talk right now .
NATHAN: Well , you think I could go ahead and get that check from ya then ? I 'm just trying to balance my checkbook here
SUZIE: Now 's not a good time .
NATHAN: When would be a good time , you think ?
SUZIE: I do n't know .
NATHAN: See the thing is
SUZIE: Okay tomorrow .
NATHAN: Great , what time ?
SUZIE: I do n't know . Just come by tomorrow . I ca n't talk now .
NATHAN: Okay great . And if you could just go ahead and have that check , that 'd be great . It 's a hundred and ten . That 's two plates at
SUZIE: Yeah , Okay Suzie shuts the door , cutting him off .
BRAD: Hey man I know you probably want to kick my ass , but
JOEL: I could n't kick your ass if I wanted to . You 're a good 10 years younger than me , and I 'm a pussy . So why do n't you just leave me alone .
BRAD: I just wanted to tell you , I 'm not gon na see Suzie anymore . You do n't have to worry .
JOEL: Why 'd you have to get hung up on Suzie ? You could have any girl you want .
BRAD: Yeah , but I want Suzie . And I ca n't have her .
JOEL: You had her fifteen times .
BRAD: Yeah , but she does n't love me dude . It 's just not the same Anyway , just wanted to tell you that .
JOEL: Well You told me .
BRAD: Alright , later
EXASPERATED SIGH: Brad , you had sex with my wife . I 'm not gon na give you a job , okay ?
BRAD: Okay Sorry man .
JOEL: Hey Brad ? Brad stops .
BRAD: Yeah ?
JOEL: I do n't know Maybe come by the office tomorrow . Fill out an application . I 'll see what I can do .
BRAD: Cool . Thanks man .
BRIAN: We 're screwed . General Mills has pretty much withdrawn the offe pending a really favorable settlement with Step . Not only do we not sell the company , we could wind up bankrupt .
JOEL: So I do n't sell the company , do n't get the money , I 'm bankrupt , I do n't get Cindy , I paid a guy to have sex with my wife , and she actually did it
BRIAN: Excuse me ?
JOEL: Nothing .
MUTTERS: Shit
NATHAN: Why are you cleaning the pool yourself ? That new guy did n't work out ?
SUZIE: Yeah , did n't work out .
NATHAN: Boy , you just ca n't get good help , eh ?
SUZIE: Yeah .
NATHAN: So , did you get a chance to write that check ?
SUZIE: Look Nathan , Joel and I are n't going to that dinner okay ? Nathan acts deeply disappointed .
NATHAN: Well gee , I wish you would 've told me that before I went and bought the tickets .
SUZIE: Joel never agreed to this Nathan , and neither did I .
NATHAN: Well , it sure sounded like you guys were going . Leslie was gon na talk to you about it , but you did n't eturn our calls . I mean , I already bought these tickets . They 're nonrefundable . I really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me
SUZIE: Okay , let me be really clear with you then . When we say `` I do n't think so , '' or even `` I 'm not sure , '' that means `` no . '' Why ca n't you understand that ?
NATHAN: Well , I just
SUZIE: Shut up ! In fact , let me be even more clear with you . We do n't like you ! Is that clear enough ? You 're dull , you never shut up , you neve listen , and we do n't want anything to do with you ever again !
WORRIED: Nathan ?
TO HIMSELF: No way
CINDY: Oh Joel . I ah ,
JOEL: Hi .
CINDY: What 're you ? What 's up ? How 'd you know I was here ?
JOEL: Ah , actually , I 'm staying here too . Down on the first floor , around the ack . I thought I saw you so I ah
CINDY: Well , come in .
JOEL: No thanks . Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke .
CINDY: Have a seat . Joel remains standing , looking at the purse .
JOEL: That 's Mary 's purse Is n't it ?
CINDY: What ?
JOEL: Right there . That 's Mary 's purse .
CINDY: Oh that ? No , that 's mine So how are things at work ?
JOEL: That 's Mary 's purse . You stole it , did n't you ?
CINDY: No . It probably just looks like it . There 's a lot of those .
JOEL: I 've never seen another one . You probably have Sylvia 's wallet in here somewhere too , do n't you ? And everything else that 's been stolen from my employees .
CINDY: Joel , are you okay ?
JOEL: No , I 'm not . That 's Mary 's purse Goddammit ! Okay ? Everyone blamed Hector . He almost got fired . Does n't that bother you ?
CINDY: Joel , I do n't know what you 're
JOEL: Hector ! Hard working guy , neve did anything wrong . And what are you doing with Step ? You 're trying to screw him out of his settlement money are n't you ?
CINDY: I have no idea what you 're talking about .
JOEL: Yes you do ! You 're the only reason he 's suing us are n't you ? You know how much work it took for me to uild up that company ? You just do n't care about anybody do you ? What are you , some kind of sociopath ?
JOEL: I bet Cindy 's not even your real name is it ? Who are you ? Where the hell are you from ? Cindy , still looking away , does n't answer .
COMPOSES HIMSELF: Well , I 'm leaving now . Joel picks up the purse .
JOEL: And I 'm taking this purse with me . If it really is yours , you can call the police and tell 'em I stole it In fact , I 'm gon na call the police and report it
CINDY: Please do n't Joel stops .
JOEL: What ?
CINDY: Please do n't report it to the police . I 'm on probation . I 'll go to jail . For a long time .
JOEL: Well Maybe you should 've thought about that before you started ipping off my employees . Joel starts to open the door .
CINDY: Joel ? Please ? I 'll leave Step alone . I promise . He 'll drop the lawsuit . Joel considers this .
JOEL: How do I know that ?
CINDY: You can keep the purse . If I do n't leave him alone ; if he does n't drop the lawsuit , then you can report me . Please ? Beat .
JOEL: Hmm I guess that ah Do you have Sylvia 's wallet , and Jim 's watch ? Can I get those too ?
REALIZING: And I guess you just admitted that you stole the purse . That 's good , I guess A step in the right direction
JOEL: So what 's your deal anyway ? I mean , how did you end up like this ?
MARY: Joel has n't been in all morning . can you believe that ?
GABRIELLE: If we come in late , we get fired . And here we 're working our tails off , and he 's gon na get rich .
JOEL: Here you go Mary .
MARY: Can you believe that ? Blaming Cindy just to protect Hector .
BRIAN: Step 's here to see you .
JOEL: Really ? Bring him in .
BRIAN: No , he 's outside . At the loading dock . Wants to talk to you alone ack there for some reason .
CRUDE IMMITATION: `` Man to man . ''
JOEL: Hi Step
STEP: Hey .
JOEL: How you doin ' ? How 's your , ah
STEP: ( looking down at his
CROTCH: Oh it 's okay . Some days it still hurts , but they 've got me on some pills . It 's not too bad I guess
JOEL: Well that 's good . They both sit down on the edge of the dock .
STEP: Look , ah Cindy left me . Joel 's nods , not surprised , but sympathetic .
JOEL: Wow Bummer
STEP: Yeah , it is a bummer You know , I thought the worst part was having my balls knocked off , but you know what the worse part is ? Dealin ' with all this bullshit I 'm sick of that Adler guy tellin ' me what to do . He 's a real dick .
JOEL: Yeah , he sure is .
STEP: The truth is , I just want to have my old life back I just want to go back to work . I 'm a workin ' man ; that 's what I do .
JOEL: Yeah I 'm beginning to think I might be the same way I 'm a little worried about what I 'd do with too much time on my hands .
STEP: I just lay around and watch TV all day .
JOEL: Yeah , I think I do a lot worse .
STEP: The problem is , if I bankrupt the company , there wo n't be a job to go ack to .
JOEL: You do n't have to bankrupt the company .
STEP: Yeah , but then if I drop the lawsuit , you 'll sell the company , and the new company might not hire me .
JOEL: Well , maybe I do n't have to sell the company You know I 've been thinking ; all these years I 've been uilding this company , dreaming about the day I could sell it and etire , but what would I really do if I retired ? It 's like that old saying it 's not about the destination , it 's about the journey ? Step just stares at him blankly , he lost him .
STEP: I 'm sorry , I do n't do much book eadin ' .
JOEL: What I 'm saying is , I 'm thinking maybe I wo n't sell the company
STEP: Really ?
JOEL: that is , if you dropped the lawsuit . and remember , you 'll still get that insurance money probably a couple hundred thousand . What do you think ?
STEP: Hmm . That sounds fair But under one condition
JOEL: What 's that ?
STEP: You make me floor manager .
JOEL: Deal . They shake hands .
BRIAN: Huh ? You 're not selling ?
JOEL: It 's about the journey Brian . The journey .
MARY: You know , if Joel 's going to put him in charge , we should go on strike . You know , at Gemco , the union handles the strikes and you do n't even have to PULL OUT as Step cuts her off .
STEP: Quit yapping and get back to work or you 're fired .
JOEL: Hi You doing okay ?
SUZIE: Yeah , I 'm okay .
JOEL: I heard you were right there when it happened . That must 've been ough .
SUZIE: It was horrible Joel . He came ove to ask for that check , and I just Suzie breaks down , starts CRYING .
CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY: I think the last thing I said to him was `` shut up . '' Those were the last words he heard . Joel hugs her , consoling .
JOEL: It 's okay , it 's not your fault It 's not your fault . Suzie 's crying subsides a little .
SUZIE: It could happen to any of us Joel . Any of us could have an aneurism . We could die at any moment .
JOEL: Yeah , I know I know But we probably wo n't . It 'll be alright . Suzie starts to regain her composure . They stand there for a beat .
SUZIE: Yeah , okay . Sure .
JOEL: Here
SUZIE: Thanks .
JOEL: Maybe we should 've been married in a Church like that one . Instead of the Botanical Gardens .
SUZIE: I thought you liked the Botanical Gardens ?
JOEL: Yeah , but a church just seems more I do n't know official .
SUZIE: You think it would 've made a difference ?
JOEL: I do n't know So , are we still married ?
SUZIE: Well , legally yes .
JOEL: I mean otherwise .
SUZIE: Hmmm We can talk about it I suppose .
JOEL: Alright . They walk for a beat .
SUZIE: What ?
JOEL: Well , as I was looking down at Nathan there , I was thinking That 's the longest I 've ever seen him with his mouth shut . Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself .
SUZIE: Joel ! They walk off into the distance as we
