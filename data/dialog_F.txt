LAZARRO: Jon , I trust your instincts , I always have . But D.C. wants more evidence . And frankly , so do I .
ARCHER: You 'll get all the evidence you need when ten thousand people die .
LAZARRO: We 'll get a team right on it . But we ca n't evacuate the city on what amounts to a hunch .
ARCHER: That bomb has been built , it 's out there somewhere and it 's going to detonate
BRODIE: Did n't Castor give any clue where the bomb might be ?
ARCHER: Only one person knows his other Pollux . And he 'll keep his mouth shut until it blows .
BRODIE: We could plant an agent in his cell get him to spill the location .
ARCHER: Pollux is way too paranoid . The only person he 'd talk to about that bomb is Castor himself . And dead men ca n't talk . Brodie and Miller exchange a knowing look .
BRODIE: There might be a way around that
ARCHER: Why are you keeping him alive ? As long as he 's breathing , he 's dangerous .
MILLER: Relax , he 's a turnip .
BRODIE: We can arrange for you to ente Erewhon Prison as Castor Troy .
ARCHER: What are you talking about ?
HOAG: I think I 'd better answer that question . Malcolm Hoag . I run the Physiological Camouflage Unit fo Special Ops .
ARCHER: I know who you are .
MILLER: But you do n't know what he can do . Physical augmentation ; enhancement surgery
BRODIE: He can disguise a compromised agent or alter the likeness even the voice of a government witness .
HOAG: Let me show you how it 's done . I think you 'll recognize ou patient
BRODIE: and a lot more classified .
ARCHER: This 'll fool Pollux .
HOAG: That is a state-of-the-art morpho- genetic template . The inside can e built to match the exact shape of your skull ; the outside exactly like Castor 's . Then we fit his face right on top
MILLER: and you become him .
ARCHER: You 're talking about removing the guy 's face ?
BRODIE: Borrowing , Jon . The procedure 's completely reversible .
MILLER: One way or the other the mission ends on the eighteenth .
BRODIE: You know Castor better than anyone . You 've lived and breathed him for years hell , you even look a little like him . Archer shoves the template back at Hoag .
ARCHER: Find yourself another lab-rat .
MILLER: If you do n't do this Casto will beat us again . He 'll beat you again
HOAG: I do n't think that went very well .
BRODIE: Trust us , Doc
MILLER: he 'll jerk around . Then he 'll e back .
ARCHER: I 'm in a hurry , Dietrich . So you 've only got ten seconds to go through your usual litany of lies , empty threats , and moronic denials . Then I 'm coming ove there
DIETRICH: If you 're in such a fucking hurry why are you wasting your time with me ? I 'm just an art dealer .
ARCHER: You 're a dealer , all right technical secrets , munitions explosives .
DIETRICH: You 've never proven any of that . And when my bitchy , never-been- laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here , she 's going to
ARCHER: Time 's up .
LAZARRO: The only ticking bomb I see is inside his head . He 's getting worse , Tito .
TITO: Do n't worry , sir . It 's all an act
DIETRICH: Okay ! Castor called me but I lew him off I swear I neve saw him . And I do n't know anything about any bomb !
ARCHER: Let him go , but I want him watched Who 's next ?
TITO: Just Dietrich 's sister
ARCHER: When was the last time you saw Castor Troy ?
SASHA: Who cares ? He 's dead .
ARCHER: Answer the question .
SASHA: Look , I 'm clean . I teach kids now
ARCHER: Sasha you are a felon , on probation for harboring Casto Troy . So it 's in your best interest to cooperate . Would you like your son put in a foster home ?
SASHA: No , but I 'm sure you 'd love it you sick bastard .
ARCHER: When was the last time you saw Castor Troy ?
SASHA: I have n't seen him for years .
ARCHER: What about Lazarro ?
BRODIE: No way the red tape alone would take a month . This is a black-bag operation completely off the ooks .
MILLER: If you need him , Tito can help you prepare . But you know the drill You ca n't tell anyone not the Director , not your wife nobody .
ARCHER: I 'm in .
EVE: I was dreaming
ARCHER: Something good ?
EVE: I 'm not sure you were flying this weird old stunt plane doing flips walking on the wings I was watching from the ground when you fell . You had a parachute , but you would n't open it .
ARCHER: Did you catch me ?
EVE: No .
ARCHER: How come ?
EVE: I do n't know Maybe because you 've never needed my help .
ARCHER: Come on , you made that up , did n't you ?
EVE: Maybe I did maybe I did n't
ARCHER: After all these years , I still ca n't get it out of my head an inch to the left , Matty would still be alive .
EVE: And you would n't be .
ARCHER: Eve
EVE: Oh , God you 're going on assignment again
ARCHER: One last time . And while I 'm gone , I want you and Jamie to go to your mother 's . It 's important
EVE: You said you 'd be here ! You promised ! What could be more important than that ?
ARCHER: I ca n't tell you except only I can do it .
EVE: You want me to tell you it 's okay to leave ? Okay , go on ! Go !
TITO: Jon , this is goddam insane . You ca n't do it .
ARCHER: Do n't worry If Hoag can do half what he claims , I 'll get Pollux to talk .
TITO: It 's not that simple , Jon Becoming another person especially him nobody can come all the way back from that not even you .
ARCHER: Keep this for me .
HOAG: Let 's walk through it , Jon . You lood types are different , but we ca n't do anything about that . Otherwise , nature is cooperating nicely . The height difference is negligible within 1/2 an inch . Eye color almost a perfect match . Penis size , flaccid , essentially the same Substantial .
ARCHER: Abdomino what ?
HOAG: A tummy tuck . On the house .
ARCHER: Do it .
TITO: Nice catch . But you used the wrong hand .
HOAG: Let 's see if I missed anything efore I get my hands really dirty . Archer removes the robe . He 's amazed to see
TITO: Jon are you all right ?
ARCHER: Okay I 'm okay . But my voice I still sound like me .
HOAG: I implanted a micro-chip onto you larynx .
ARCHER: Now what ?
TITO: We 're down to 72 hours . Let 's call Lazarro . Castor Troy just came out of his coma .
LOOMIS: What a week for Archer to go on a training op . Maybe we should try to contact him .
WANDA: Forget it . He 's knee-deep in Georgia swamp by now .
ARCHER: Do n't forget I ordered a koshe meal
WALTON: You are now an Erewhon inmate a citizen of nowhere . Human rights zealots , the Geneva convention and the P.C . police have no authority here . You have no right When I say your ass belongs to me I mean it . Bend over .
ARCHER: They 're too tight .
WALTON: So 's a noose . Now keep your mouth shut .
LITTLE MAN: Hey , Castor remember me ?
ARCHER: Fabrice Voisine sure , I I believe Jon Archer busted you for poisoning five members of the the Canadian parliament ?
GUARD: Central . I have a disturbance in population . Go to lock down
WALTON: Hold that lock down .
ARCHER: Never in the face .
WALTON: Lock 'em down .
ARCHER: What ? He started it !
WALTON: You 'll what ?
ARCHER: I 'm going to have you fired .
WALTON: That 's two strikes , Dubov . One more and you know where you 're going . Back to your 'suites ' or no dinner .
POLLUX: Hey , bro
ARCHER: Pollux ?
POLLUX: Of course it 's Pollux , what the fuck 's wrong with you ?
CASTOR: Lars okay , Lunt , then . Something really fucked-up happened I 'm in trouble so listen very carefully
HOAG: What 's this about ? What do you want ?
CASTOR: What do you think I want ?
POLLUX: You realize , of course , that magnetic humming is designed to drive us insane . If we all do n't get brain tumors first .
VOISINE: And that same cloying Bambi tape over and over
POLLUX: It 's like they 're begging us to iot . Where the fuck are we , anyway ? Got ta go
ARCHER: Why ?
POLLUX: Your jumpshot has no arc . You used to swagger now you swish . You 're gumming that butt like a Catholic school girl . And why do you keep picking at your finger ?
ARCHER: I was in a coma
POLLUX: You Pollinated his wife the day he was arrested . How could forget that ?
ARCHER: I 've forgotten plenty . Look around we 've screwed over half the freaks in here . What 's gon na happen to us if they think I 've lost it ?
POLLUX: Man that was the worst day of our lives !
ARCHER: Oh , God Mom O-D 'd at County General .
POLLUX: Retching and convulsing while those bastards did n't even try to save her sorry ass . You gave he mouth to mouth man even then you had some constitution . Remember what you swore to me at the funeral ?
ARCHER: Uh to kill the doctors ?
POLLUX: After that . You promised you 'd always take care of me .
ARCHER: And I bet I kept that promise
POLLUX: Only one you 've never broken .
ARCHER: Screw the past . We 've got the future to look forward to . We still have tomorrow .
POLLUX: No shit five million bucks now those Red Militia crackpots get to keep it .
ARCHER: That 's not the worst part .
POLLUX: What 's worse than losing five million bucks ?
ARCHER: Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows . What you built was a work of art . It belongs in the Smithsonian .
POLLUX: Yeah well the L.A. Convention Center will have to do
ARCHER: Thanks , Pollux .
POLLUX: 'Thanks ' ? I guess they really did fuck you up .
WALTON: You have a visitor .
IMPOSTOR: What 's the matter ? Do n't you like the new me ?
ARCHER: Castor ?
CASTOR: Not anymore .
ARCHER: It ca n't be . It 's impossible .
CASTOR: I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was 'titanically remote ' . Who knows ? Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out . O maybe God really is on my side after all . By the way , I know you do n't get the papers in here .
ARCHER: You killed them ?
CASTOR: Of course I killed them , you dum fuck . Hoag , his staff
ARCHER: He does n't know anything about this !
CASTOR: Come on , Jon . I think I know you etter than that . I only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face
ARCHER: Castor , do n't do this
CASTOR: No discussion , Jon no deals . Now if you 'll excuse me , I 've got an important government job to abuse , and a beautiful wife to fuck . Excuse me I mean 'make love to . '
WALTON: Sorry , sir .
CASTOR: It 's quite all right . You neve know what to expect from a psychopathic criminal
WALTON: Better be nice , Castor . You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone .
ARCHER: Pollux is what ?
WALTON: Archer cut him a deal for turning state 's evidence . He 's been eleased
ARCHER: Walton , you have to listen to me right now !
WALTON: Or what ? You 'll have me fired ? You 're confined until I say otherwise
CASTOR: Jesus , what a life .
EVE: I suppose it was only a matter of time before you forgot where we lived .
CASTOR: Sorry the job 's been murde lately .
EVE: So what happened to you 'important ' assignment ?
CASTOR: What do you know about it ?
EVE: I know exactly what you always tell me Absolutely nothing .
CASTOR: It did n't work out the way everyone thought it would . Where are you off to ?
EVE: I 've got surgery .
CASTOR: Surgery are you okay ? Then he spots her medical bag . Oops .
EVE: Do n't try to charm me I 'm still angry . There 're leftovers in the fridge .
CASTOR: Have fun at work . Castor kisses her good-bye on the mouth .
EVE: What is with you ?
CASTOR: Do n't I usually kiss my wife ?
EVE: No .
CASTOR: What a dump .
JAMIE: I got your E-mail , Karl . That poem was really sweet Hang on a sec She slams it but he gets his foot inside .
CASTOR: I 'm coming in , Janie . Castor pushes menacingly into the room .
JAMIE: 'Janie ' ?
CASTOR: I do n't think you heard me Jamie You have something I want
JAMIE: Clarissa left those here .
CASTOR: I wo n't tell mom if you do n't .
JAMIE: When did you start smoking ?
CASTOR: You 'll be seeing a lot of changes around here Daddy 's a new man . Jamie stares , astonished , as Castor goes out .
BUZZ: Listen , sir we just want you to know
WANDA: We 're all really sorry about Tito
CASTOR: Yeah , well , shit happens .
BUZZ: He has n't told us a damn thing except what kind of mustard he likes on his tongue sandwiches .
WANDA: If that bomb is out there we 're almost out of time .
LAZARRO: You made a deal with Pollux Troy ? He 's ' a manipulative psychopath . ' Your own words , Jon !
CASTOR: Just let me do my job , Victor .
LAZARRO: The job I 've been protecting fo the last eight years . From now on , you go strictly by the book . Everything gets cleared by me . Understand ?
CASTOR: You 're supposed to be snitching making me look good .
POLLUX: 'Look good ' ? Seeing that face I want to vomit .
CASTOR: I 'm the one who has to look at this butt-ugly mug every time I pass a mirror . Look at my eyes , my chin , my perfect nose gone ! Archer took my life , so I 'm taking his . Bro , I 'm going straight .
POLLUX: Sounds like they took your brain , too ?
CASTOR: Imagine Dillinger as J. Edga Hoover . Carlos the Jackal running Interpol . Kaddafi heading the Mossad . Think of the secrets we could sell
POLLUX: The drug agents we could expose . The movie stars we could lackmail !
CASTOR: That 's just the bottom of the food chain . Pollux what would happen if somebody planted a bom on Air Force One ?
POLLUX: that somebody would get rich . And , I suppose , the nation would e pretty pissed-off .
CASTOR: Pissed-off , vulnerable looking for someone to step in , take charge , give them hope again . What if that someone was an F.B.I . hero ? A true Boy Scout and family man with a spotless past . Imagine where that guy could land if the timing 's right .
POLLUX: It 's an audacious dream , Caz . But Jon Archer is hardly a household name .
CASTOR: Not yet he is n't . But after you 'confess ' you 'll be a free man . And I 'll be on my way
BOMB LEADER: Jesus Any suggestions ?
TECHNICIAN: Yeah run
BOMB LEADER: It 's protected by a vibration detector One touch and
CASTOR: Evacuate your team , Captain .

WALTON: A special privilege today TV y order of Agent Jon Archer of the F.B.I
REPORTER RICE: The apparent target was a group of Supreme Court justices due to speak here today . Mr. Archer , do you have any idea who planted it ?

WANDA: Stop the presses Jon Arche found a personality
KIM: Sir the White House is calling .
CASTOR: Jon , your career is finally taking of . Archer . Sure I 'll hold
JAMIE: Do n't make me beat your butt again , Dad . It 's harmful to my developing psyche .
CASTOR: Afraid you 'll lose ?
JAMIE: Got ta go . Karl 's here .
CASTOR: Do n't tell me you forgot . Eve it 's date night !
EVE: Why do I feel like I 'm on a blind date ?
CASTOR: It 's important to keep some mystery so things stay unpredictable .
EVE: 'Unpredictable ' ? You 're about as unpredictable as the tide . How long are you going to be gone this time ?
CASTOR: Gone ?
EVE: Is n't that what all this is about ? The wine , cooking me dinner your next assignment ?
CASTOR: I 'm not going anywhere .
EVE: You always say that then you leave .
CASTOR: I bet I deserved that . I bet Jon Archer is the most inattentive , sexless spouse on Earth .
EVE: Jon , that 's not true
CASTOR: Of course it 's true , but I 'm trying to change ? I 'm here ecause I want to be alone with you . I want to see the candle- light dance in your beautiful
EVE: Your what ?
CASTOR: Well , I do n't have it yet . But Lazarro 's getting old he wo n't e around forever . And I 'm getting the itch to move up .
EVE: Jon that 's wonderful .
CASTOR: So you see , I 'm not going anywhere . Unless it 's upstairs with you
ARCHER: Do n't they ever let us take off these boots ?
VOISINE: Not unless you 're sent to the 'Clinic . '
ARCHER: You mean if I get sick ?
VOISINE: They do n't give two fucks about your health . The Clinic 's where they send the real hard-cases fo attitude adjustment . Dubov just got sent down and look at Wainwright
ARCHER: What did he do ?
VOISINE: He hit a guard .
WALTON: Looking for trouble , Castor ?
ARCHER: As a matter of fact yes . Crack ! Archer decks Walton .
WALTON: Bite hard , scumbag , 'cause you 'll e gumming baby food from here on out .
ARCHER: Dubov come on !
WALTON: There !
ARCHER: Let 's go !
ARCHER: Come on come on Archer senses something He looks up and
EVE: Last night , I thought this is n't my husband .
CASTOR: I could n't sleep you roll around a lot . Anyway , I 'm late .
EVE: Jon , you know what day it is . I know it 's difficult for you , but we still have to go .
CASTOR: Ca n't we skip it just this once ? I got ta 'protect and serve ' , you know .

EVE: Are n't you going to get that ?
CASTOR: Stop crying stop crying stop

CASTOR: He 's what ?
BUZZ: Somehow he escaped from Erewhon . But a prison chopper mowed him down just off Long Beach Harbor
CASTOR: Where 's the body ?
WANDA: It has n't been recovered yet .

BUZZ: L.A.P.D. ? Even if he is alive , Castor is n't stupid enough to come ack to the city .
CASTOR: He 's alive and he 's already here . Move !
ARCHER: Dr. Archer please . It 's an emergency . Her husband .
EVE: How did this happen , sweetie ?
IRIS'S DAD: She fell off her Big-Wheel .
NURSE: Dr. Archer your husband 's on three .
EVE: Get Child Services down here and do n't let her father leave . Jon ? Hello ? INTERCUT Archer and Eve as necessary .
ARCHER: Eve , listen carefully . The man you think is your husband is n't .
EVE: Who is this ?
ARCHER: Please , just listen ! Take Jamie and go to your mother 's in Santa Fe . Do n't tell him where you 're going just go .
EVE: Whoever you are do n't call again
ARCHER: I need to speak to Directo Lazarro immediately I have information about Castor Troy .
CASTOR: This is Jon Archer . Who 's calling ?
ARCHER: Well , if you 're Jon Archer I guess this must be Castor Troy
CASTOR: I 've got ta hand it to you , Jon . You 're doing a damn respectable job of being me . But let 's face it , we both liked it better the way it was . So before the cops low your brains out why not tell me where you are
ARCHER: If you were really me , you 'd know no discussion , no deals . Archer hangs up == leaving Castor stewing .
CHOLO #2: Ten bucks he 's the guy who popped Tito !

JAMIE: You mean like condoms ?
CASTOR: I mean like protection .
JAMIE: For me ?

POLLUX: I thought he might visit some old friends of yours . And bro , if I did n't know better I 'd swea this guy likes being you
ARCHER: Uh ca n't we just talk ?
SASHA: Talk ? The only talk I ever heard from you was 'take it off , ' 'sit on it , ' ' I 'll pay you tomorrow . '

LOOMIS: Forget him , sir . It 's only Pollux Troy
WANDA: What happened ?
CASTOR: What the fuck do you think happened ? Castor Troy just shot him ! What are you waiting for ? Go !
KIM: Sir you 're on the cover of Time . They 're calling you 'An Authentic American Hero . '
CASTOR: What is it ? Lazarro shuts the door behind him .
LAZARRO: We were friends once , Jon , so I feel I owe it to you to tell you face-to-face I do n't care how much hype you 're getting you 're through . Afte that massacre last night , I 'm ordering a full inquiry into you ecent erratic and deeply suspect behavior .
CASTOR: Me 'erratic ' ? Victor , what are you talking about ?
LAZARRO: You start meeting with Brodie and Miller . Then they die mysteriously . Your best friend is murdered and you do n't seem to give a shit . Suddenly you 're smoking , drinking , acting like a man with something to hide Maybe you 've been bought maybe you 've lost your mind . But I promise I 'm going to find out .
CASTOR: Okay , Vic , I have a confession to make . But you are n't gon na like it I 'm Castor Troy .
LAZARRO: I do n't understand
CASTOR: Now you understand . He punches up the intercom button .
DISPATCHER: All units . I have a confirmed code zero-zero priority alert . Proceed at once to Parthenia Street Terminal . That 's Parthenia at Nordhoff .
WANDA: Commander , what are you doing here ?
CASTOR: Where should I be ? Where 's everyone else ?
WANDA: Backing you up ! Did n't you track Castor to the Parthenia Street Terminal ?
CASTOR: What ?
WANDA: You radioed in your personal security code . Nobody knows that code but you .
CASTOR: Obviously someone else knows it ! Get everybody back to thei posts now !
ARCHER: Eve
EVE: I know you you 're the one who called . You 're Castor Troy . You killed my son
ARCHER: I called , but I 'm not Castor . I 'm your husband . Archer holds onto her as she struggles again .
EVE: How did he expect to do that ?
ARCHER: An F.B.I . surgeon gave me Castor 's face . He handled the transplant , the vocal implant , everything . But somehow Castor came out of his coma and killed everyone who knew about the mission . But not efore he was transformed into me .
CASTOR: You 're all in knots . Maybe another date night will help you elax
EVE: Not tonight I 'm way behind in my Continuing Ed .
CASTOR: You think I 've been acting strange . Like a completely different person .
EVE: Yes .
CASTOR: Okay , I have a confession to make . But you are n't going to like it
EVE: What memorial service ?
CASTOR: Victor Lazarro had a heart seizure right in my office . It was horrible
EVE: Oh , my God Castor pours it on feigning immense grief .
CASTOR: First Tito now Victor please do n't tell me I 'm going to lose you , too
EVE: Of course not .
CASTOR: What was that ?
EVE: What was what ?
CASTOR: Something bit me .
EVE: Probably a mosquito I 'll close the window .
COP: Sorry , Dr. Archer . Where are you going at this hour ?
EVE: There 's been an emergency at the hospital .
COP: One of us will have to escort you .
EVE: Fine But please do n't wake my husband he 's exhausted .
ARCHER: What are you doing ? Where did you get that gun ?
EVE: I took it from my fake husband .
ARCHER: Why point it at me ? I 'm the real thing .
EVE: I do n't know that . Maybe Jon 's already dead .
ARCHER: What more proof do you need ?
EVE: Tell me tell me about the all- night dentist .
ARCHER: I took a date out for chicken and ribs not knowing she was a vegetarian . When the night could n't get worse , she broke her tooth on a pebble that got into her three-bean salad Somehow she and I had fun driving around looking for an all-night dentist And even though it must have hurt you still kissed me .
EVE: Christ , Jon ! How could you put us in this position ? Do you know do you know what he did to me ?
ARCHER: Whatever happened , whatever he did I know it 's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you
EVE: But you 're damn well going to try . First how are we going to get you out of this ?
ARCHER: Good . What 's his schedule tomorrow ?
EVE: He does n't tell me anymore than you ever did All I know is tomorrow we 're going to Victor 's memorial service .
ARCHER: Victor Tito they both died thinking I killed them And in a way I did .
EVE: Jon you ca n't think about that now .
ARCHER: What happens after the memorial ?
EVE: He 's taking Jamie and me away .
ARCHER: And neither of you will be coming ack . Where 's the service ?
EVE: Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea . Archer reacts the irony 's not lost on him .
ARCHER: Hit him with a trank dart . Once he 's unconscious I 'll try to get to Buzz and Wanda before the security team gets to me .
EVE: What else can I do ?
ARCHER: Think up a good excuse . I do n't want you or Jamie anywhere nea that service .
EVE: I can cover for Jamie . But if I 'm not there , he 'll suspect something The second you make your move , all hell 's going to break loose . If I 'm there beside him I can take charge . I 'm his wife , remember ? There 's no way around it fo once , you need me .
ARCHER: I 've always needed you
EVE: Jon what are the odds ?
ARCHER: Terrible . But it 's the best we can do with what we have . If it does n't happen , take Jamie and do n't look back
EVE: It 'll happen .
ARCHER: Do doctors travel in packs ?
EVE: Only when we 're golfing .
CASTOR: That 's what you 're going to explain to me .
EVE: Did n't the police tell you ? There was an emergency .
CASTOR: Not as ill as he 's going to be
EVE: It 's my fault . I should 've woken you up before I left . Now please let me get back to work .
CASTOR: Stay here . Watch her like a hawk .
LARS: Think she knows ?
CASTOR: Who cares ? She 's going to be dead y tonight anyway . They 're all going to be dead . The wife , the kid and the father .
ARCHER: How 's the boy ?
SASHA: His ears are still ringing but he 'll be okay .
ARCHER: 'Us ' ? No , Sasha believe me , this is n't your fight .
CASTOR: Where 's Jamie ?
EVE: That 's what I 'd like to know . She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off . Castor 's eyes narrow trying to read Eve .
CASTOR: I 'll deal with her later .
EVE: Good . Because I am fed up .
PRIEST: We are here to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro . We all know him as a man who dedicated himself to defending this great nation first , as a highly decorated admiral then , as west coast director of the F.B.I . But not all of you know what a deeply spiritual man he was . It was his wish that his Requiem Mass be performed in Latin . In Nomine Patris , et Filii et Spiritus Sancti . Amen
PRIEST: Requiem aeternam dona eis , Domine Amen .
JAMIE: Thanks anyway , Mom But I wanted to be here for you and Dad .
PRIEST: The admiral 's family will now take his ashes to the sea
CASTOR: Lars take Jamie , bring the ca around , then meet us at that oathouse
EVE: Wanda I need to talk to you .
WANDA: Sure what 's wrong ?
EVE: Never mind
CASTOR: Come on , baby . I 've got a surprise for you .
EVE: Why is he here ?
CASTOR: Before I turn him in , I thought we 'd pay him back for everything he 's put us through
ARCHER: This is between you and me . Leave them out of this .
CASTOR: It was between you and me . Even your little boy that was n't supposed to happen . But you could n't let it go .
ARCHER: No father could .
CASTOR: Appealing to my sense of 'family ' wo n't work , Jon . I thought you knew me better than that
ARCHER: I know some things that even you do n't know , Caz . You have a son . I 've met him . His name is Adam
CASTOR: I imagine I 've got a dozen kids so what ? No more head games First you wife dies . Then your daughter . Then you . Castor smiles as the DOOR CREAKS open .
DIETRICH: That 's right , Archer . Now drop 'em .
LARS: Do n't fucking move
SASHA: Caz are you okay ?
CASTOR: You 're making a mistake . I 'm Castor he 's Archer . Sasha , aby just give me a minute to explain !
SASHA: That 's pathetic , Archer . But then , your terrible sense of humo is legendary .
ALDO: It 's pay-back time .
ARCHER: Find Jamie !
EVE: Jamie ? Jamie ! BULLETS SHRED the WINDOWS behind her .
SASHA: Help Adam do n't let him end up like us
DIETRICH: Sasha !
WANDA: We heard gunshots
EVE: Wanda , I 've got to tell you something . Something crazy
ARCHER: Give up , Castor . People are going to find out .
CASTOR: Not if I kill you first .
ARCHER: No , Jamie . Do n't do it !
CASTOR: It 's a trick , Jamie . I 'm you father .
ARCHER: Jamie
CASTOR: Shoot him !
WANDA: You 're both under arrest until a D.N.A . test proves who 's who .
CASTOR: I 'm ordering you to back off !
WANDA: Put the gun down
BUZZ: Now !
CASTOR: Ca n't blame me for trying .
CASTOR: Give me your weapon now !
JAMIE: Who are you ? Will someone please tell me what 's going on ? Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open .
BOAT CAPTAIN: Hey !
CASTOR: You wo n't shoot me , Jon . I 'm unarmed
ARCHER: Okay , I have a confession to make but you are n't gon na like it You 're right , I wo n't shoot you . Not in the face anyway .
CASTOR: It 'll never be over , Jon every time you look in the mirror you 'll see my face
BUZZ: You okay , Archer ?
ARCHER: What did you call me ?
WANDA: He called you 'Archer ' sir .
EVE: Hang on , Jon they 're bringing in their top surgical team from
ARCHER: How is he ?
EVE: No life signs at all . He 's a turnip .
ARCHER: That 's what they always say
WANDA: I 'm sorry , Eve . You ca n't come . Take her home .
EVE: But he 's my husband !
WANDA: But he works for us .
JAMIE: Will Dad be Dad again ?
EVE: I hope so , honey .
JAMIE: And you guys say my life is screwed up
ARCHER: I have something to ask you to ask both of you He steps aside revealing Castor 's son .
EVE: How was your first day back ?
VALERIE: Jessica McDowell . Cognis Chemicals . I hope I 'm not late .
CHANEL SUIT: When do you leave Kuala Lumpur , Ms. Macdowall ?
VALERIE: I fly to Taiwan Tuesday then back to Dusseldorf . I really only need five minutes of his time..
CHANEL SUIT: I hope we are lucky . He is very usy man .
SECRETARY: Mr Tabir very busy this morning .
VALERIE: Oh I can imagine .
HAFIZ: ..why do n't you practice you little pitch on me ?
VALERIE: Actually . If it 's all the same-
HAFIZ: I know all my uncle 's business . He trusts me . Begin .
VALERIE: Well . I 'm sure you 're aware Mr.. You 're aware that recently you subsidiary , Kopa Oleochemicals developed an organic , ester based lubricant derived from Kernel oil , that makes offshore drilling significantly more environmental . My company , Cognis CMBH wants-
HAFIZ: You American ? She stops .
VALERIE: Canadian . Actually . From Toronto .
HAFIZ: You a Maple Leafs fan ?
VALERIE: Right . Uh . No . Not really .
HAFIZ: You must be the only person from Toronto 's not a hockey fan . Valerie holds his dead eyes .
VALERIE: Oh I 'm a fan . Dad 's from Vancouver , so I 'm a Canuck . Between us , the Maple Leaves suck . They should never have signed Mark Bell . Guy 's a liability on an off the ice . So who 's your team ?
HAFIZ: I do n't like hockey .
CHANEL SUIT: Unfortunately Mr Tabir has no window this morning . But tonight he extends invitation to private eception at his residence .
VALERIE: Is that ok ? I really do n't wish to intrude .
HAFIZ: Come to the party .
VALERIE: Mr. Tabir ? Jessica McDowall , Cognis GMBH . Thank you for allowing me to come to your beautiful Home .
TABIR: How can I help you ?
VALERIE: Mr Tabir I wonder if you had time to glance at our proposal which would allow Kopa to access to Cognis ' current Petrochemical Service Partners . Essentially its-
TABIR: Please excuse me , I have to attend to something.. My assistant here will make you comfortable..
VALERIE: Hi . I was waiting for Mr. Tabir .
HAFIZ: My uncle had to leave . He asked me to drive you to his tennis club . You can have your meeting there..
VALERIE: Why are we stopping ? He looks at her . Undoes his seatbelt .
HAFIZ: Ms. Macdowall , my uncle believes that trust is something you earn . And he does n't trust anyone until he knows them very , very well..
VALERIE: But he trusts you , Hafiz..
HAFIZ: How do you know my name ?
VALERIE: Your car was swept an hour ago . Do not get out . If you get out of this car I ca n't protect you .
HAFIZ: Who are you ?
VALERIE: Let go of my arm Hafiz . NOW .
HAFIZ: Fuck you .
VALERIE: Your brother is in Kalutara jail in Colombo facing execution fo trafficking . We can help him .
SUE: So after like six hours , he finally manages to stand up on the snowboard , and the instructor lets go of him and he just plummets.. I swear to god , he ca n't turn , slow down , for like four hundred yards .
BILL: And yet I 'm incredible in bed .
JOE: Keep the change .
STEVE: So what do you do Valerie ?
VALERIE: I work in Venture Capital . Brewste Jennings , here in Georgetown .
STEVE: Cool . So like net startups.. ?
VALERIE: Right . Retail and consumer.. Basically we create pooled investment vehicles..
STEVE: Sounds high risk..
VALERIE: I guess . But you know..high risk , high return . Pretty boring actually . So what do you do ?
STEVE: We got the same train to you mom 's .
DIANA: Whatever they 're telling us we 're totally vulnerable . I mean who 's protecting us .
VALERIE: It 's real scary .
LISA: Joe . Would you risk taking you kids to Disneyland right now ?
JOE: Absolutely not . Far from being a playground of the imagination , Disneyland is actually a giant clearing house for crappy merchandise . And Space Mountain is a major disappointment .
VALERIE: Joe thinks Disneyland is Vegas fo kids .
STEVE: Vegas . A dirty bomb in Vegas .
JEFF: OK. You get on a plane , there 's two guys with turbans , seats A1 and 2 .
JOE: Ye Gods..
JEFF: Steve you have a two year old . You 're off that plane . You 're calling the cops . I think if we 're honest we all are . Joe . Two guys . On a plane . Turbans . Praying . Sweating . What 's the call ?
JOE: Well Jeff..
VALERIE: Every time . Every time we go out .
JOE: He started it-
VALERIE: He 's drunk Joe . Everybody 's had a hard day . They 're just trying to let off steam-
JOE: By invoking quasi-racist connundra ? The guy 's a parent .
VALERIE: So you ca n't call him a racist pussy .
JOE: If not sitting there while someone spouts obnoxious crap makes you an asshole . Then I 'm an asshole . And you knew that when you married me . By the way . How was your trip ?
VALERIE: Who 's that ?
JOE: Hi . Forgive me . I was staring . It 's just I 'm sure we 've met before .
VALERIE: So who am I ?
JOE: Joe . Joe Wilson .
VALERIE: Former Ambassador to Gabon . Ambassador in Iraq during the Gulf War . Married twice.. Has a eputation for trouble .
JOE: You 've been misinformed . I was only acting Ambassador in Iraq . Valerie smiles . He does too . It 's electric .
VALERIE: I 'm an energy consultant for a firm in Brussels .
JOE: And do you enjoy your work ?
VALERIE: I love it .
JOE: Val . Where 's the babysitter ?
VALERIE: Did n't I say ? She ca n't get here til after lunch .
JOE: OK . I 'll work from home this morning .
VALERIE: Are you sure-
JOE: Relax . Me ` n Spongebob are on it .
SAMANTHA: I promise to behave .
JOE: See . We 're all gon na be on our best ehavior .
CPD AGENT: Bad time ?
VALERIE: Hafiz hired a cleaner .
ALI: Got ta go . Kuala Lumpur just went live .
VALERIE: What time did he call this in ?
CPD AGENT: 11 hundred hours PST .
VALERIE: We have a shipment . A holding company in Pakistan asks Tabir to purchase 200 un-identified units , trackable by part numbers , from..
ALI: Teludyne Electronics of Lowell Massachusetts..
VALERIE: Sir , we 're from U.S customs . Can I take a moment of your time ?
ALI: What the hell is that ? Valerie looks at the object .
DR FORSTER: To detonate a nuclear bomb you need to be able to switch high voltage , high current electrical circuits at very high speeds to the nearest hundredth of a nanosecond .
VALERIE: Does it have other uses ?
DR FORSTER: High speed photography , industrial photo-chemistry . Zapping kidney stones.Is someone out there uilding the fire train for a nuclear device component by component ? You 're talking one helluva complicated process . This guy is just one tiny piece in the jigsaw . She hands him a piece of paper .
VALERIE: This is a list of other components exported through the same network over the last 3 years . Tilt tables . timing equipment . High speed monitioring devices .
DR FORSTER: Quartz rate sensors . Calibration units It 's not kidney stones . Thank god you stopped this .
VALERIE: I 'm not stopping it .
DR FORSTER: I do n't understand..
VALERIE: We keep the transaction live . Trace it all the way to the end user . She takes them through a full whiteboard .
ALI: Can we put a wire on the asset ?
VALERIE: Too dangerous . This network has avoided detection for years . Expect meticulous operational security and counter surveillance . Any questions ?
DEPUTY CPD: Val . The chief wants to see you .
BILL: Val , seventh floor have issued a directive for a Joint Task Force on Iraq . We want you to head it up . Valerie does n't blink .
VALERIE: Yes Sir .
BILL: You can pick your team . This is top priority . Down the line D.F.U .
VALERIE: What about the Dubai op ?
BILL: Mike says you got a hunch on the uyer .
VALERIE: Manucher Vaziri . Syrian National . Based out of Karachi . On a wire picked up in Cairo he talks about componentry from a known source in Pakistan he 's moving to an unnamed Gulf state..
BILL: Iraq ?
VALERIE: Vaziri 's devoutly Shia . Iraq 's controlled by the Sunni . Saddam 's Sunni . There 's no way this is Iraq .
BILL: They 're all good Muslims right ?
VALERIE: And Martin Luther King and the KKK are both Christian .
BILL: Great job . From Monday , I need you oth eyes on Iraq .
MIKE: D.F.U ?
VALERIE: Do n't fuck up .
PRESIDENT: They could attack our allies o attempt to blackmail the United States . In any of these cases , the price of indifference would be catastrophic .
JOE: Hey hey hey . Everybody OK ? Let 's take a look at you . Four arms . Fou legs . No broken bones .
HEATHER: Hey kids ! Joe I 'm sorry I 'm late .
JOE: That 's fine . Look guys . Heather 's here .
ANALYST 1: Memo comes out saying we got two percent women in executive roles . It 's quotas by another name . There 's ten guys I could name could do the job better..
ANALYST 2: I wonder who 's she 's fucking . She freezes . SUDDENLY
MIKE: DIA released the report Tuesday . WINPAC are n't buying and State kicked it back , but it 's making waves in the Vice President 's Office . What do you think ?
VALERIE: He 's qualified . He 's been there hundreds of times . Knows the arena inside out .
MIKE: You do n't look overjoyed .
VALERIE: He 's been working hard to build his usiness . Then there 's the twins . Money 's kinda tight right now .
MIKE: We 're at full stretch here . You know that better than anyone . He 's helped us before . Could you ask him to come in ?
VALERIE: You want to go out for breakfast . Or stay here ?
JOE: I want to live with you .
VALERIE: There 's something I have to tell you .
JOE: Is your name really Valerie ? She smiles .
VALERIE: I need to get you cleared .
JOE: You work in the basement ?
VALERIE: Actually . I work in Georgetown fo Brewster Jennings . We 're a small firm of Venture Capitalists .
JOE: That must be interesting work .
VALERIE: It pays the rent .
MIKE: Mr Wilson , what can you tell us about Yellowcake ? Joe looks around the room . Clears his throat .
JOE: I believe it 's a concentrate obtained from uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs . But I 'm not a scientist .
MIKE: What about Niger ?
JOE: The UN Human Development Index anks Niger the number one Least Liveable country in the world . I started my Foreign Service there . As Ambassador to Gabon , I travelled ack many times . Then as directo of Africa policy for the NSC unde President Clinton , I frequently visited , often met with Prime Minister Mayaki . I know the forme foreign minister . I know the Minister of Mines .
MIKE: The Office of the Vice President has received a report concerning a memorandum of sale between the governments of Niger and Iraq fo the purchase of five hundred tons of Yellowcake Uranium ore..
JOE WILSON: No Sir , you do n't . He leans forward .
MIKE: This is a request from the Vice President . Can you help us ?
JOE: Par la grace D'Allah . Comment allez vous , M. Bonzala ?
MINISTER: Last time we met I was Minister , you Ambassador . Now , thanks to Allah , we are free men . You 're growing a beard , no ?
JOE: So it would seem .
MINISTER: So tell me . How can Niger help its old friend , America ?
TURNER: `` In summer 2001 Iraq sought to purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075-T4 aluminum tubes manufactured in China . The high spec of these tubes led us to conclude they were intended for the enrichment of uranium . In August 2001 J. Turner.. '' That 's me.. `` flew to Vienna , to meet with IAEA scientists . Mr. Turner produced this report , aspects of which epresents the CIA 's present position . '' I 'm happy to take questions .
ANALYST: The INR concluded late last yea that these tubes were probably fo artillery use , and the DOE agreed they exactly matched those used by Iraq for artillery rockets .
PAUL: Where are the tubes ?
TURNER: WINPAC has them . We 've examined them . This is my point . None of you guys has even seen the tubes .
VALERIE: I 've seen them . Everyone looks at her .
TURNER: And when was that ?
VALERIE: When I seized them last year in Jordan . When I headed the covert team that intercepted them , bought ack samples and delivered them to you guys at WINPAC . A couple of the analysts try not to smile .
TURNER: So I take it you 're not a nuclea expert . These tubes are an EXACT match for those developed by German scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s . Valerie turns to her notes from her reading .
VALERIE: You 're right . I 'm no nuclea expert . But Dr. Houston Wood , at Virginia U atomic facility is . He also knows Dr Zippe , who 's 89 and lives in Austria , and he told him that the wall thickness of the Iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of his design .
PAUL: And the tubes are twice as long as Zippe 's design . In fact the only similarity between his tubes and the alumumium tubes is that they 're made of aluminium .
VALERIE: A metal that has n't been used in gas centrifuges since 1952 .
TURNER: I went to Vienna . Canada . I 've worked on this for months . They 're centrifuges . Fact .
PAUL: So basically , they 're your tubes and if we do n't let you win you 're going home .
TURNER: That 's pathetic .
VALERIE: Joe . No one is saying you 're wrong here . But if you 're right , it 's huge . So we ask the question . Right ? We have to ask the question .
JOE: 500 tons of Yellowcake is not an off the books size transaction , it epresents a 40 % production increase in the nation 's annual output of uranium . A sale that size would leave a huge paper trail .
JOE: The droughts of the 80s and 90s were met by millions of dollars of U.S Aid , which continues to this day . It just does n't make sense Niger would compromise this lifeline . For that reason , and the others I 've given , it 's my opinion that the sale could n't happen .
VALERIE: They write a report . Give it to the analysts . It 'll be re-written , then kicked upstairs where it 'll be thrown in with whoever else 's eport they got- Joe snorts derisively .
JOE: You guys are hysterical . I ca n't elieve you 're actually gon na send someone else all the way out there to ask exactly the same questions .
VALERIE: You ca n't compile Intelligence from a single source ? That 's not Intelligence . That 's an opinion .
JOE: I can save the CIA some air fare here . There is n't a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened .
VALERIE: Say who ?
JOE: Says me .
VALERIE: What if you 're wrong ? One guy says it 's true . It 's not true . Lots of guys say it 's true , it 's still not true . It 's intelligence . It 's slow . Painstaking . But it works . Checks and balances .
JOE: What am I , a check or a balance ?
VALERIE: Probably neither . You 're a teeny tiny weeny cog in a giant machine . But you did your job . You should feel good . They count on that . That 's why they do n't pay you .
JOE: I 'm not feeling that 007 right now .
VALERIE: I can get the kids to make you a medal , if it 'll help .
JOE: Us double oh 's are more about the gratuitous sex .
VALERIE: I 'll see what I can do . They start making out .
JOURNALIST: Mr. President , in your speeches now you rarely talk or mention Osama in Laden . Why is that ?
VALERIE: Why is the OVP here ?
MIKE: What the fuck ?
LIBBY: My name is I. Lewis Libby . I 'm the Chief of Staff to The Vice President . You are ?
ANALYST: Dave . I 'm an analyst . In non- proliferation .
LIBBY: What can you tell the Vice President about aluminium tubes ?
PAVITT: Relax Mike . The Veep 's just dotting the i 's .
MIKE: Bullshit Jim . The only time a Vice President comes to Langley is to cut a fucking ribbon .
PAVITT: Look . Cheney does n't trust us . This shit with Dick goes back thirty years . It 'll blow over . Where are we on Iraq ?
VALERIE: Behind the curve Sir . Most of the intel is outdated . We do n't have a single operative or asset in the country .
PAVITT: What about geo-satellite imaging ?
VALERIE: With respect sir , you ca n't look at this problem from space and make a call .
PAVITT: So talk to the defectors .
VALERIE: The defectors are unreliable . Most are supplied through a former asset the agency 's had on a burn notice since ` 95 . It 's a racket . They walk in and get paid to say whatever the Pentagon wants to hear .
PAVITT: So we 're blind .
VALERIE: We need sources we can rely on . We need to get in close .
PAVITT: How close ?
VALERIE: Inside .
BILL: Jim . Val thinks she can get us inside the weapons program . Pavitt looks at her .
PAVITT: How ?
PROFESSOR AZIZ: Red-shifting , generates a large atio of energy scales so that the natural scale at one end of the extra dimension is much larger . Valerie watches .
VALERIE: Thank you .
PROFESSOR AZIZ: The Faculty have just moved me , so you must excuse the mess .
VALERIE: Thank you .
PROFESSOR AZIZ: Tell me Dr. Harper , did you read my latest paper on quarks . I cite you 1995 essay more than once . I would e very intrigued to know what you made of my findings..
VALERIE: Sir , Dr Harper is in Cambridge , Massachusetts . She received a call yesterday requesting she stay home for 48 hours . The professor blinks . Taken aback .
PROFESSOR AZIZ: I do n't understand . Who are you ?
VALERIE: I 'm sorry for misleading you . But I 'm here to ask you the same question . Because you are not Professor Aziz . He stands there . Thrown .
PROFESSOR AZIZ: Well . This is indeed a strange morning . Madam , there seems to have een a mistake . My name is Said Uhmah Aziz . I am a theoretical physicist . I model space . I 've never been to Basra . I 'm a teacher . I 'd like to be of assistance . But I 'm afraid I ca n't help you .
VALERIE: So you 're not Doctor Fallari .
PROFESSOR AZIZ: Madam . I 've never even heard of this man .
VALERIE: You were not lead engineer at the Osirak nuclear installation outside Tikrit . You were never captured by the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria . You did n't spend three years in the Abu Dhan jail .
PROFESSOR AZIZ: This is absurd .
VALERIE: You were n't tortured . Broken . You did n't finally escape and arrive here in Cairo with nothing .
PROFESSOR AZIZ: No .
VALERIE: Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters . They were taken by Uday Hussein 's private guard . He never saw them again . He stares at the floor .
PROFESSOR: You know nothing .
SECRETARY: They 're back .
ANALYST 1: The Iraqis were trying to buy the tubes off the internet . They spent three million dollars weather- proofing the tubes . Plus the tubes are roughly twice too long . Now you could argue that that 's to disguise them , you could saw them in half . That 's sixty thousand tubes . I mean whew . Saddam 's gon na get the mother of all blisters..
ANALYST 2: How was it ?
ANALYST 1: Do n't make jokes .
ANALYST 2: He thinks I do n't know how serious it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days , we 've gone back over and over it .
PAUL: OK . I 'll handle this .
LIBBY: Let me level with you here Paul . I do n't know what these tubes are for . From everything you 're saying , there could be something to this , ut very likely not , right ?
PAUL: Exactly .
LIBBY: May I ask a question ? When you say we do n't really know how to play this , what do you mean ?
PAUL: I 'm just saying I do n't know how to say it any other way than that-
LIBBY: Except you did n't say ` I ' you said ` we ' . So you and the others have discussed how to `` play '' these iefings . Why does the CIA feel the need to play these briefings ?
PAUL: No . I mean that.. Ok . I did n't mean what I just said .
LIBBY: Which part . The last part . Or othe things too .
PAUL: I 'm a getting a little confused-
LIBBY: You want me to come back ?
PAUL: No . GOD no . The temperature drops five degrees .
LIBBY: You do n't know why I 'm here do you ? In 1991 the United States invaded Iraq , and afterwards weapons inspectors discovered Saddam was six months off enriching uranium to sufficiently high specification to make a nuclear bomb . He had fissile material . And not a single person at the CIA , from the DCI down to the janitor had the slightest clue that such a program even existed . So now , one decade on , are you telling me that you 're 100 % sure these tubes are not intended to create nuclear weapons ?
PAUL: I..Sir..OK. With intelligence , nothing 's 100 percent .
LIBBY: So . What ? Are you.. Ninety nine percent sure ? Ninety eight ?
PAUL: You ca n't put an exact figure . You ca n't be that precise .
LIBBY: But if you had to say , could you say you 're ninety seven percent sure ? Is there a three percent chance you 've got this wrong ? O four ? Or five ? Still pretty good odds . You like those odds Paul ? You willing to put your name to that . Are you ready to make that call ?
PAUL: I do n't make the call , Sir- .
LIBBY: Yes you do Paul . Each time you interpret a piece of data . Each time you choose a `` maybe '' over a `` perhaps '' you make a call . A decision . And right now you 're making lots of little decisions adding up to a big decision and out there 's a real world where millions of people depend upon you being ight . But what if there 's a one percent chance you 're wrong . Can you say for sure you 'll take that chance and state , as a fact , that this equipment is not intended fo a nuclear weapons programme ? The analyst sits frozen .
PAUL: Sir . We 're not machines . We.. It.. We look at the evidence , we game it out . Not everyone agrees all the time . It 's a process .
LIBBY: It 's a process .
PAUL: Yes .
LIBBY: And not everyone agrees .
PAUL: Exactly .
LIBBY: Who does n't agree ?
ANALYST: What the fuck is Joe Turner doing next to the DCI ?
ANALYST 2: Did n't you hear ? Friday the DCI took him to the White House . He iefed the President on Aluminum tubes .
ANALYST: You 're fucking kidding me .
BILL: So we 've got a list of names . The Mukhbarat watch the scientists night and day . Their houses are ugged . Their friends are followed .
TACTICAL COMMANDER: Say we drop in a light weight tac team outside the city .
BILL: You get through the checkpoints and oadblocks . You show up in my edroom in the dead of the night with an armed tac team ask me to help out Uncle Sam ? I 'm going to eact unpredictably .
TACTICAL COMMANDER: What about forcible extraction of two or three of the main targets ?
VALERIE: No . We 've got 29 names . I want to get to them all .
JOE: It 's three forty five..
VALERIE: I got ta go . I have to be at the airport in forty five minutes . Joe , still half-asleep , catches up .
JOE: Wellhow long this time ? I mean Do we need childcare fo tomorrow-
VALERIE: I left a post-it by the lamp . Its all on the post-it .
JOE: Right . Its on the post-it .
VALERIE: I did n't want to wake you . Are you OK ?
JOE: We 've been leaving post-its fo each other for months now.. we talk via Post-It . That fridge is like a dead letter drop . Jesus . Listen to me ! . I sound like an old Some- I do n't know where you go . Who you meet . If you 're in some jail , o lying in some ditch in Jordan , Beirut . And if you go missing , I ca n't tell anyone because you were never there . I 'd never know what happened . I do n't know where you go .
VALERIE: I 'm going to Cleveland . He stops . Thunder-robbed .
JOE: Have a nice day .
VALERIE: Dr. Al Haddad ? Is there somewhere we can speak ?
SAWSAN: 1989 . I attended a medical convention over there . Before that , in ` 83 , he came here for an engineering conference . Twice in twenty five years . We try to stay in contact . It 's difficult .
VALERIE: Would you like to go back and see him ? SAWSAN holds her gaze .
SAWSAN: You want me to become a spy .
VALERIE: We need to ask Sa'ad some questions . Do you think he would answer them ?
SAWSAN: I 'm a doctor . I work hard . I 'm also a mother . I have a small girl and I 'm all she has .
VALERIE: We can help your brother . Right now he is extremely valuable to us .
SAWSAN: And to Saddam . The Mukbarat watch him night and day .
VALERIE: He could come here Sawsan . He 's an expert physicist . He 'd have a job , his children , his family would be safe . You , your daughter could see him whever you want . Sawsan . Can you help us ?
SAWSAN: I wo n't do anything to help you . I do n't know you . I would only do this for Sa'ad .
VALERIE: Then do it for Sa'ad . Valerie watches her .
SAWSAN: What would I have to do ?
AGENT 1: The pages of this notebook are fast urning . You write on them like normal , but if you need to destroy them in an emergency..
AGENT 2: The ink in this pen is visible fo 10 seconds . Only when given the the correct chemical fixative can it be ead .
SAWSAN: - I am not taking any of this . If the Mukhbarat find any of this they will do things to me you can not imagine . Tell me what you need to know . I will memorise it .
AGENT 2: Ma'am , we have 50 very specific questions , some extremely technical .
SAWSAN: You have 206 different bones in your body . Do you want their names in english , latin or arabic ?
VALERIE: How do you feel ?
SAWSAN: Except it 's not the truth . How do you do it ? She searches Valerie 's face .
ALI: It 's time .
VALERIE: You have to know . Know why you 're lying . And never forget the truth..
BLITZER: We read in the New York Times today a story that says that Saddam Hussein is closer to acquiring nuclear weapons .
RICE: We do know that he is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon . That there have been shipments into Iraq of high-quality aluminum tubes that are only really suited for nuclea weapons programs , centrifuge programs.. VALERIE freezes .
COLIN POWELL: And as we saw in reporting just this morning , he is still trying to acquire some of the specialized aluminum tubing one needs to develop centrifuges that would give you an enrichment capability .
RUSSERT: Aluminium tubes ?
CHENEY: Specifically aluminum tubes . There 's a story in The New York Times this morning . I want to attribute The Times . I do n't want to talk about specific intelligence sources but it 's now public that he has been seeking to acquire the kinds of tubes that are necessary to build a centrifuge .
MIKE: Someone in the OVP leaked to the New York Times and now they 're across the networks quoting the leak . `` Smoking gun '' . `` Mushroom cloud '' . They 're using the same words . It 's co-ordinated .
VALERIE: I 'm coming home .
JOE WILSON: OK . Number one I always open the window and close the door..
VALERIE: You can still smell it .
JOE: You want me to roll up a wet towel ? Like a teenager smoking in his edroom . Maybe sandbag my study ?
VALERIE: Put on a coat .
JOE: Valerie . Steve . Help me out . Val . The whole point of a cigar you got ta get a little Winston Churchill vibe goin ' . Slippers . A crackling fire .
STEVE: Musty books , slippers . Maybe a faithful hound .
JOE WILSON: Exactly . You ca n't be freezing you alls off in a GOOSEDOWN alone in the dark .
VALERIE: Do n't think Churchill . Think Scott of the Antarctic .
JOE: That 's it . I quit .
JOE WILSON: My father smoked cigars at the dinner table for forty years . And look at me .
SUE: Can I ask a dumb question . What is an aluminum tube ?
FRED: How ? Who knows what they are ?
JEFF: Did you read about this Valerie ?
VALERIE: I was in Europe on business last week . I missed it .
JEFF: Basically Saddam bought all these tubes . And we 've nailed him . We got them . They 're packed with uranium .
STEVE: They 're not packed with uranium .
JEFF: Right . They 're for purifying it . The bomb comes later . It 's how you oil it up it to make the big one .
JOE WILSON: Well Jeff . I do n't know anything about these tubes . I 'm not qualified . But I suppose the real question here is- BILL interrupts , stealing Joe 's limelight .
FRED: It 's a pretext ! 50 % of Americans think Saddam blew up the Towers-
DIANA: He 's a threat . You ca n't tell me he 's not a threat .
LISA: He 's mad . Like Hitler . If we 'd stopped Hitler in the thirties- Joe sits there . Fuming .
FRED: He 's not Hitler . He 's Saddam . We put him there . Why ? It suited us . He 's our fault . Always was . Right on cue , Joe rounds on the hapless FRED .
JOE WILSON: Have you met him ? Fred . Have you met Saddam ? Have you looked him in the eye ? Did he threaten you ? Did he threaten to kill you ? You do n't know Saddam . You do n't know what you 're talking about . Joe gets up . Joe walks out .
JEFF: What is this ? Meet the Press ?
LISA: Val 's made a Lemon Meringue .
SUE: MmmThat smells good . Shall I get some bowls .
VALERIE: Thank Sue . Bottom cupboard .
SUE: We have a rule at home . No politics at the table . It always ends in a squabble . I mean , nobody knows what 's going on over there . At the end of the day , who really knows ?
VALERIE: You 're right Sue . Who knows ?
PASSPORT CONTROL: Its her .
MUKHBARAT OFFICER: Al Haddad ?
OFFICER: Wait here .
SA'AD: How is my little sister ?
SAWSAN: Sa'ad ! I am so happy to see you .
SA'AD: I 've a friend in security services . I 've been a government employee fo 25 years , there has to be some advantage . You can wait all day . Sawsan smiles at her brother .
SAWSAN: The house looks very different .
SA'AD: It 's falling down . In ` 93 they ombed government buildings here . The foundations are shattered .
SAWSAN: Sa'ad I need to speak- He holds up his hand and shakes his head .
SA'AD: ..I have been meaning to repaint the exterior..
SAWSAN: The gardens yes of course , I would like to see them .
SA'AD: I am watched Sawsan . If I drive even twenty minutes north of Baghdad they will stop me .
SAWSAN: They 've given me questions for you .
SA'AD: What questions ?
SAWSAN: How close is your program to a warhead ? When and where is the first test scheduled ? How much 235- grade uranium do you have ? Identify other scientists in the program .
SA'AD: They do not know ?
SAWSAN: What Sa'ad ?
SA'AD: The program was destroyed in 1991 . The Americans destroyed it , they know that . My god..what else ?
SAWSAN: How advanced is the centrifuge facility ? Which method are you using to separate fissile isotopes ?
SA'AD: This is insane . We do n't have spare parts to keep a tank on the road . I have to work at a plant which develops fertilizer . They know . The inspectors are back . They know this . They must know .
ALI: You need to see this..
STUDENT: Mr Wilson . Jason Neal . How was you flight ?
VALERIE: We need Mike to see this . And Bill .
PROFESSOR: Ambassador Wilson is the last American diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein . In 1990 , when Saddam threatened to execute anyone sheltering foreigners , Wilson appeared at a press conference wearing a noose around his neck , declaring , `` If the choice is to allow Americans to be taken hostage or be executed , I will bring my own fucking rope . '' Saddam backed down and Wilson evacuated several thousand . He came home and was taken to the Oval Office where the President introduced him to the Wa Cabinet as an American hero .
JOE: That 's not quite true . It was n't the Oval Office it was the Roosevelt Room . Laughter .
VALERIE: Sawsan 's brother worked with five hundred scientists at the Safa factory . In ` 91 it was blanket ombed by B52s . Hussein Kamel , Saddam 's son in law , kept the scientists together , threatening to kill them if they tried to leave . But sanctions destroyed the economy , and when Kamel was executed in ` 95 , the team just drifted apart . They 're all say the same thing Mike . Everyone .
STUDENT: Does Saddam pose an imminent threat to National Security ?
JOE: I have n't seen the intelligence . I 'm not qualified to comment . We have intelligence services working hard to assess just this . But I have met Saddam . I 've looked him in the eye , so I can tell you what I saw . During a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties , Saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had een a loyal supporter . He said he would rather kill a friend in erro than allow an enemy to live . Fo me , that is the mark of a monster .
PRESIDENT: Mr. Speaker , Vice President Cheney , Members of Congress , distinguished guests , fellow citizens Every year , by law and by custom , we meet here to conside the state of the union . This year , we gathe in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead .
STUDENT: We 'd like you to have this coffee mug . And some Pennants . For you kids . Thank you so much for coming and speaking to us .
PAVITT: So you got thirty nuclea scientists interrogated by Iraqis , inside Iraq , who are all saying the same thing .
BILL: Jim , these people took a great risk-
PAVITT: To bring us what ? I could have saved us the air-fare-
BILL: The White House is getting
JIM PAVITT: You know we can bark about this all night . But that 's all we 're doing . Barking . You , me , all of us.. We 're guard dogs . We can bark and bark , ut at the end of the day , someone 's got ta listen . Because it 's not our house . Even if it is on fire .
JOE WILSON: Can I get an American please . Just a regular American ?
PUBLIC ADDRESS: Ladies and Gentlemen Flight 22 to Dulles is boarding immediately at Gate 20 . We apologize for the delay due to adverse weather conditions-
PRESIDENT: We Americans have faith in ourselves , but not in ourselves alone . We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence , yet we can trust in them , placing our confidence
SA'AD: What you doing ? They 're watching-
SCIENTIST: No one 's watching . Not anymore . I think the Secret Police have their hands full .
SCIENTIST 2: We 're free . Free to be blown to smithereens .
SA'AD: Least no Mukbarat gets to watch it . They all laugh at the gallows humor . And hug
SCIENTIST: And you trust them ? Open your eyes .
SCIENTIST 2: And your ears . Your American friends are calling you right now .
SA'AD: It 's our only hope .
VALERIE: Bill . Wait up .
BILL: Val , every Mobile Exploration Team is combing the desert looking fo WMD . I can't-
VALERIE: I gave my word Bill .
BILL: That 's not my problem . I got bigge problems .
VALERIE: Hold the elevator please .
MIKE: Bill 's right . This is just one snafu in a thousand we got right now . The scientists are-
VALERIE: These scientists are the WMD . If we ca n't protect them , they 'll run to the first country who can . And they 'll put them to work . Mike looks at her .
MIKE: I never said this . If anyone asks , I deny any knowledge . How quietly can you do this ?
VALERIE: Beth ! Who do you have in Baghdad ? I need to get an RG-17 to an asset in Mansour .
BETH: Why do n't your guys to do it ?
VALERIE: I 'm asking you .
SA'AD: I need to know my family will be safe .
VALERIE: Sa'ad , I know that . We will take care of your family . But we have to move fast .
SA'AD: How do I know I can trust you ?
VALERIE: Sa'ad . Do exactly as I say , we wo n't let you down .
PETE: So how 's Val ? Is she there ? Put he on..
JOE: She 's fine . She 's working late .
PETE: Val 's working late . I 'm working late . You do n't see a pattern here ? You know she finds me devastatingly attractive-
JOE: Yeah . Well if you see her say hi . Listen Pete . I have a question . And it 's real important .
PETE: I 've seen the INR . It 's Niger . He 's eferring specifically to Yellowcake from Niger . Why ? Joe listens . It sinks in .
JOE WILSON: I do n't know . I do n't know what to do .
PETE: You want my advice ? Do nothing . You already did your job . You did you est . You came home . End of story .
JOE WILSON: Niger Pete . Yellowcake from Niger . Pete looks around . Speaks low .
PETE: Look . I do n't have to go all the way to Africa to know something 's fucked up here . Three months and what have we found ? No centrifuges . No yellowcake . No bio . No WMD . You think something 's up here . Join the queue . Join the line stretches all the way from State to the Pentagon and back .
JOE WILSON: So why has no one 's come forward ?
PETE: Why you think Joe ? We went to war . Listen . You 're a smart guy . As you friend , now . Just . Be smart here . I mean..you have a wife and a family .
JOE WILSON: It 's the White House Pete . It 's the President of the United States .
PETE: Yes it is Joe . Now go take a long look in the mirror and say that again .
JOE: Hey . Are you OK ?
VALERIE: Nothing . I 'm just tired..
JOE: Whats the matter..what happened ? Valerie shakes her head slowly .
VALERIE: I 'm fine . Are the kids asleep .
JOE: Yeah . They 're asleep .
VALERIE: OK . I 'm going to bed .
REPORTER: Retired Ambassador Joe Wilson yesterday claimed in a piece in the New York Times that the President mispoke in his State of the Union Address in January , concerning claims that Saddam sought 500 tons of Yellowcake from Niger . Wilson , who was acting Ambassador in Iraq during the first Gulf War , said-
JOURNALIST: Is the President 's statement correct ?
JOURNALIST 2: The President 's statement was accurate ?
JOURNALIST: So you believe the British report is true ?
CARD: Uh-oh .
HADLEY: Linda . Clear my morning .
JOURNALIST: So it was wrong ?
FLEISCHER: Let me do this , David . On you specific question I 'm going to come ack to you . The reporters leap to their feet in uproar..
ROVE: What is that tit-fuckin ' homo Fleischer doing to us ? Call Mary . Call Scooter . Call Hadley . We need to get a hold of this . NOW !
MARTIN: -CBS know Yellowcake was pulled from Cincinnatti ten weeks ago at the CIAs request . They also have that Gerson wrote both speeches . Karl is on line one . He 's unhappy-
LIBBY: I want a transcript of everything across networks , blogs and print citing Ambassador Wilson , Niger o Yellowcake . I want Hadley to meet me in the VP 's office in five minutes . And tell Karl I 'll be in my office straight after I 'm done . I have something . He goes into the Vice President 's office .
ROVE: Who is Joe Wilson ?
LIBBY: Linda . You still here . It 's late..
ROVE: We ca n't do this . Libby nods .
LIBBY: So who can ?
VALERIE: The CIA 's decision to send retired diplomat Joseph C. Wilson to Africa-
JOE WILSON: Further down .
VALERIE: Wilson never worked for the CIA , ut his wife , Valerie Plame..
JOE: `` is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction . ''
VALERIE: Does this run overseas ?
JOE: Valerie . Where are you going ?
VALERIE: Good morning Sir . Ma'am .
BILL: One thing at time . Make a list . Then come back here . Do n't do anything else . She opens her mouth . Nothing comes out .
VALERIE: Sir , why is Internal security here ?
BILL: To help us . To help you , and us conduct this damage assessment . Behind her , the Internal security guy stands .
VALERIE: Mike . We need to get a message to Baghdad . Sa'ad and his family are eing taken to the border today . I have to get word to them . INTERNAL SECURITY watches him closely .
MIKE: I do n't what you 're talking about..
VALERIE: Mike . They 're packed and ready . Mike you know what this means .
MIKE: Sorry . I have to go . He goes inside and closes his door .
BILL: Go fuck yourself . He closes the door in his face .
BILL: Sit down Valerie . I 've just been on the seventh floor . As of this morning all CPD operations involving you have been suspended . Effective immediately you are to have no further contact with assets or agents in the field . Any further involvement in operations is no longer possible .
VALERIE: Bill . I have eight , nine teams in the field . We have assets in Kuala Lumpur . Dubai . Mumbai .
BILL: The head of the JTFI 's identity is classified for reasons of operational security .
VALERIE: I have a critical operation in Baghdad in a major ongoing-
BILL: Val . It 's over .
JOE: `` Two senior administration officials told me that Wilson 's wife suggested sending him to Niger '' That means a Vice President , a chief of staff or top advisor.. I got ta go .
VALERIE: Hey guys . Give mommy a kiss .
SAMANTHA: I said please . It 's not fair .
VALERIE: Wow . That is one cool scarecrow . Do n't eat that Sam . It 's a crayon . It 's icky . Give it to mommy .
JOE WILSON: How did it go ? The phone rings . She freezes .
JOE: It 's been ringing all day .
VALERIE: Do n't pick it up . Who 've you spoken to ? Joe , who have you spoken to ?
JOE WILSON: Hello ? It 's Lisa . Valerie looks blind sided .
JOE: OK who wants to watch TV ?
VALERIE: Hello ?
LISA: Val . Are you OK ? Whats going on ?
VALERIE: Lisa . Yes . I read it . Listen- I 'm sorry..I ca n't talk about this . I can't..I ca n't make a comment on this right now .
LISA: You ca n't make `` a comment '' ? Val . Your name is in the paper . It says you 're a CIA agent . NEXT DOOR THE KIDS Watch TV .
VALERIE: I have to go . I 'm sorry . I 'll call you tomorrow . VALERIE hangs up . Joe is standing there .
JOE: Your mom called . And your Uncle . And Janey called from Chicago . I wrote them down . And Andrea Mitchell called . She says White House sources say that quote `` the real story here is not the sixteen words but Wilson and his wife '' . Would I care to comment ? Yeah I fuckin ' would care to comment . She wants me on the show day after tomorrow .
VALERIE: I do n't want you to go on TV .
FLOOR MANAGER: Going in thirty seconds .
JOE: This is clearly designed as a shot across the bow to those who might step forward , those unnamed analysts who said they were pressured by the White House would think twice about having their own families names being dragged through this particular mud .
ANCHOR: You 're saying a crime was committed
JOE: It is a crime to reveal the identity of a covert agent working in the employ of this nations intelligence agencies . This is now a matter for the justice department Pete .
MCLENNAN: First of all , that is not the way this White House operates .
REPORTER: Will the President move aggressively to see if such a transgression has occurred in the White House ?
PRESIDENT: This is a very serious matter , ou administration takes it seriously . I 've got all the confidence the Justice Department will do a good , thorough job . I want there to be full participation , because , April , I am most interested in finding out the truth .
JOE WILSON: They 've launched an investigation . Ashcroft just announced it . They 're saying he 's going to convene a grand jury .
VALERIE: I have to go . Samantha 's crying .
JOE WILSON: I 'll be home later . I got ta go ove to Fox . They want me to comment on the investigation .
VALERIE: Joe-
JOE WILSON: We have to fight this Val . If we do n't push back . He looks at his phone .
JOE: I have another call . I have to go .
VALERIE: Joe- He 's gone . She puts the phone down .
JOE: Joe Wilson .
CHRIS MATTHEWS: Joe , its Chris Matthews . I just spoke to Karl Rove . He told me `` Wilson 's Wife is fair game '' . He goes still .
VALERIE: ` 84 . Straight out of college .
DIANA: Jenny said it makes a weird kind of sense . Everyone says Valerie 's a great listener . Asks lots of questions . About your job . About Steve or the kids .
VALERIE: I had no plan for this day . Right now it feels like I'm.. Everything is smashed into a million pieces . It 's like I 'm suddenly in this-
DIANA: Why did you do it ?
VALERIE: What ? Valerie is still .
DIANA: Every conversation . For twenty years . Thousands of phone-calls . You lied to me on every single one . Nineteen years . Birthdays . My wedding . You 're my best friend Val . Diana has tears in her eyes .
VALERIE: Diana . I know it 's hard to understand , but it..
DIANA: Normal .
VALERIE: I know this is strange for you . And you may not feel like it 's , but I need you right now . Because I'm-
DIANA: What ? What are you ? My ol ' pal Val ? I have photos . Hundreds and hundreds of photographs with this person . And..
VALERIE: Hey guys . How was your day ?
PHONE: Your husband is a fucking communist . I hope you die you fucking communist whore . She puts the phone down . Frozen . Shaking .
SAMANTHA: Mommy .
VALERIE: It 's OK honey . Mommy 's just tired .
SAWSAN: Your name and address are all ove the web . There 's even a picture of your house..
VALERIE: Who ?
SAWSAN: Sa'ad 's colleagues . Dr Habbuck was shot dead in the street . Dr Falli was murdered in his hallway . They 're killing them .
VALERIE: Sawsan , listen to me-
SAWSAN: I know you ca n't tell me where he is . Just tell me you have him . I eg you . Please . I do n't need to know anything . Just tell me he 's safe.. He 's my little brother . Please . If you have him , if he 's somewhere Please . Please , I beg you . Do you have him . I have to know . Valerie speaks quietly .
VALERIE: We do n't have him . Sawsan closes her eyes . She sobs .
SAWSAN: You said he would be safe . You said we would help . You promised- VALERIE approaches . Sawsan withdraws .
MIKE: Valerie . What are you doing here ?
VALERIE: Falli . Habbuck . Who else ?
MIKE: Valerie-
VALERIE: Who else Mike ?
MIKE: I do n't know what you 're talking about . She fixes him . Eventually he shrugs .
VALERIE: A call ?
MIKE: We passed your case files to liason . You know yourself we 're not great at this stuff . Val , Mossad were already on the same page .
VALERIE: You've.. We 're killing them . We 're killing the scientists .
MIKE: Valerie-
VALERIE: You 'll drive them underground . They 'll run straight to Iran . Pakistan .
MIKE: Valerie . This is n't your problem anymore .
VALERIE: It 's not my problem . It 's not my problem . How can you sleep when you know-
MIKE: I sleep just fine . Now Carol 's mother is here . I 'm going to have to ask you to leave .
VALERIE: It 's called counter-proliferation , Mike . She turns and walks out .
JOE WILSON: At the end of the day , it 's of keen interest to me to see whether o not we can get Karl Rove frog- marched out of White House in handcuffs . And trust me when I use that name , I measure my words . Cheers . Applause . Joe looks defiant .
SUPPORTER: We came all the way from Portland for this .
JOE: Your support means everything to us . Really .
SUPPORTER 2: You 're a true American hero .
JOE: The real heroes are in Iraq right now fighting a war which was prosecuted on lies and falsehoods .
PAVITT: Thank you for coming here today . I wanted to convey my outrage to you in person . In all my experience , nothing has disgusted me like this business .
VALERIE: I get death threats every day . People threatening to kill my husband . Hurt my children . I went to the agency and I requested security to protect my family . It was declined . Because quote `` My circumstances fall outside budget protocols . '' If this is a knife fight , right now , Sir - we 're fighting it alone . Pavitt starts to chuckle .
PAVITT: Joe Wilson versus the White House . Well , all I can say is Good Luck . But as a friend , I feel I should tell you that those men.. He points down the hill at the White House .
JOE WILSON: Tucker Carlson said yesterday that Wilson 's wife sent him on a oondoggle . Said I needed the work . Who needs to work for free ? Nige does have restaurants . The Opera . Reminds me alot of Paris .
VALERIE: What do I think ? Do I want my photograph in Vanity Fair ? Is that the question ?
JOE WILSON: Valwhat 's wrong ? What did I say ?
VALERIE: My name is everywhere , Joe . My real name . Everywhere . All this publicity and noise and fighting talk , where is it getting us ?
JOE: Karl Rove told the Financial Times they 're rolling the earth movers over Joe Wilson . Quote .
VALERIE: It 's the White House Joe . You seriously think you can pick a fight with the White House and win . They 'll bury us .
JOE WILSON: They 'll bury us if we do n't . How loud can you shout Val ? Say we get in an argument you think you 're ight , and I think your wrong . You start making your point with all your might , and I start shouting ack , except I 'm the White House , and I can a shout a million times louder . Does that make me right ? They lied Val . That 's the truth .
VALERIE: By the time they 're finished here you wo n't know what that is .
ROVE: Scooter home ?
LIBBY: What 's that ?
ROVE: Findings of the Select Committee on Intelligence . All five hundred pages and eleven pages of it .
LIBBY: Am I going to enjoy it ?
ROVE: I know someone who is n't . Libby smiles .
TREVOR: Look at the soldiers mommy . Look !
JOE: Go and play now . And he walks over to Valerie on the bench .
VALERIE: Hey .
JOE WILSON: That is the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence . On page thirty six it says `` the former ambassador 's wife offered up his name '' and includes a memorandum written by Valerie Plame which says quote `` my husband has good relations with oth the prime minister and the former Minister of Mines , both of whom could possibly shed light on this sort of activity . '' I 've spent a whole year denying just this .
VALERIE: Joe wait-
JOE WILSON: Telling everyone who 'll listen , on TV . In the press . My wife did not send me on a junket .
VALERIE: Joe . I didn ` t send you . I did n't have that power .
JOE WILSON: You sent an email . The SSCI found the email .
VALERIE: I did n't make the decision . I was asked to write a recommendation . What am I supposed to do . Not say my husband knows about this .
JOE WILSON: They have this now . They will call me a liar . It will stick . They have all the power here , what do I have ?
VALERIE: Joe-
JOE WILSON: You have to defend us . Now .
VALERIE: So what do you want me to do Joe ? Go to the papers like you did ? Write a piece in the New York Times ? You know I 'd have to submit it to the Agency , and they'll-
JOE WILSON: The agency ? The.. Wait.. Is this the same Agency which wo n't give you protection for your children ? Is this the same CIA that 's erased your pension ? Where 's your loyalty Val ? To your husband or the CIA ?
VALERIE: It 's to MY FAMILY . I put my family first . ALWAYS . Were you putting them first when you wrote that fucking article ?
JOE WILSON: Maybe you 're right . Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut . Is that what your dad taught you Valerie ? That what Colonel Sam Plame said ?
JOE: Did you send me to Niger ? `` His business is struggling . He 's on the slide . I 'll throw him a one . '' Was that it Val ? You pull some strings for me ? You help you old man out ?
VALERIE: How dare you ?
JOE WILSON: Did you send me ?
VALERIE: You think I 'm lying to you .
JOE: Could I tell if you were ? Utter silence .
VALERIE: You fucking bastard..
ANCHORMAN: The Senate Intelligence Committee published information that showed Joe Wilson had lied about how he came to be sent to Niger . He denied that his wife had any role in it whatsoever , but a memo Plame wrote on February 12 , 2002 proves otherwise .
REPORTER: Mr Wilson , do you still maintain the Vice President 's office sent you Niger and not your wife ?
REPORTER 2: Mr Wilson was Niger just a free holiday ? A boondoggle ?
JOE WILSON: My wife did not send me . I did n't eceive payment . It was not a holiday . It was a fact finding mission in the run up to a war . But the fact is no one wanted facts .
REPORTER: Are you against our troops M Wilson ?
JOE WILSON: No comment .
GUEST: The question still remains , who is Valerie Plame ? Was she really simply a glorified typist ?
ROGERS: Well , I think it 's really all about the money . We 're talking about a third-rate CIA agent who had a government salary , and she had sent her husband to Niger , and he had come back and did n't give the eport to the CIA , but he turned it over in an op-ed to The New York Times . So she was already in the hot seat with the CIA , and so now she 's all about the money . Plus it 's come out that she was considered kind of a mediocre agent at best .
VALERIE: When we were at the `` Farm '' , training to be field officers , they picked four or five of us and told us we 'd stood out .
JOE WILSON: Hey guys .
SAMANTHA: We 're going on a mystery tour .
TREVOR: Why are n't you coming daddy . It hits him in the gut .
JOE WILSON: Come here . He scoops them up . Kisses him . Her .
VALERIE: OK guys . C'mon .
VALERIE'S MOM: Who wants to make toffee apples ?
KIDS: Me ! Me !
VALERIE: It 's beautiful .
VALERIE'S MOM: Sam . I keep telling you . They have a table .
JOE WILSON: Good morning .

KATE: The kids are asleep
JACK: Well that ’ s just greatthose little monkeys can be a real handful Kate shuts off the TV .
KATE: I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed .
JACK: I ’ m working on a new deal now
KATE: Fine , but not tonight
JACK: Wait a second . You want me , don ’ t you ?
KATE: That is the general idea , yes Kate starts kissing himbut Jack ’ s a little
JACK: Shouldn ’ t we grab some dinner first ? Maybe a ottle of wine ?
KATE: It ’ s ten thirty , Jack . By eleven you ’ re gon na be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off . We don ’ t have time fo wining and dining .
JACK: Whatever you sayhoney .
KATE: Thanks , Jack
JACK: No , I ’ m seriousyou ’ re eally stunning
KATE: This is good stuff , Jack , keep it coming
JACK: I mean back in college , you were a very pretty girl , there ’ s no question about that . But this you ’ ve really grown into a beautiful woman
KATE: How can you do that ?
JACK: Do what ?
KATE: Look at me like you haven ’ t seen me every day for the last twelve years
ANNIE: Mary Janes , Mom . You promised .
KATE: That ’ s right . Okay , let ’ s make a quick stop at the kids ’ shoe department , pick up my watch from the battery place , then I ’ ll run into the linen store An unhappy look on Jack ’ s face .
JACK: Why don ’ t we just go to all the stores ? ! Kate looks back at Jack .
KATE: You know what , Jack ? ! I ’ ll go with the kids . Why don ’ t you just hang out here in the men ’ s department okay ?
SALESMAN: Would you like to try it on ?
KATE: I meanwowoff the charts great .
JACK: It ’ s an unbelievable thing . Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person . I ’ m gon na buy it
KATE: $ 2,400 ? ! Are you out of your mind ?
JACK: She got those shoes
KATE: Those shoes were twenty five dollars . C ’ mon , take it off . We ’ ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like .
JACK: No . Kate looks at Jack , a little surprised .
KATE: No ?
JACK: Do you have any idea what my life is like ?
KATE: Excuse me ?
JACK: I wake up in the morning covered in dog salivaI drop the kids off , spend eight hours selling tires etailretail , Kate . Kate just stands here , aghast
KATE: Really .
JACK: What ’ s in it for me ? Where are my Mary Janes ? Kate stares at him , shaking her head
KATE: It ’ s sad to hear you life is such a disappointment to you , Jack .
JACK: I can ’ t believe it ’ s not a disappointment to you ! Jesus , Kate , I could ’ ve een a thousand times the man I became . How could you do this to me ? How could you let me give up on my dreams like this ? ! Kate stares at him in disbelief . Then
KATE: Who are you ?
JACK: Look , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m sorry I was such a saint efore and I ’ m such a prick now . Maybe I ’ m just not the same guy I was when we got married
KATE: Maybe you ’ re not . The Jack Campbell I married wouldn ’ t need a $ 2400 suit to make himself feel etter about his life , ut if that ’ s what it ’ s gon na take , then buy it . Just buy the goddamn suit we can take the money out of the kids ’ college fund .
JACK: Forget it We ’ ll get a funnel cake . It ’ ll be the highlight of my week
KATE: I ’ ll give you this , life has thrown us a few surprises A glimmer in Jack ’ s eye

JACK: Sure . I really like Annie .
KATE: Good , Jack . Maybe we ’ ll keep her .
JACK: No , I love Annie . We had a lot of good times , didn ’ t we ?
KATE: We were young Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to ?
JACK: Charles Street ? In the Village ? When we were living in Greenwich Village ? Great times . Why ’ d we ever leave ?
KATE: You can ’ t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village Jack nods , starting to piece it together .
JACK: You had a heart attack ?
KATE: Jack , stop that . I 'm still mad at you who knows what would ’ ve happened if you hadn ’ t stepped in at the store .
JACK: That ’ s why I work for Big Ed ? A look from Kate .
KATE: If you want to look at it that way
JACK: How would you look at it ?
KATE: A great success story
JACK: Damn
ARNIE: Jesus , Jack , this is a league match , for god ’ s sake !
JACK: Hey , I ’ m doing the best I can I ’ d like to see you hit a squash ball afte seventeen beers
ARNIE: You ’ re right . Why am I so competitive ! ? Compensation , I guess . Look , just focus , Jack . You can still pick up the spare Jack retrieves his ball , sets up , genuinely concentrating
JACK: You are Jack Campbell . You ’ re better than this sport . You shot the apids at Kenai . You ran with the bulls at Pamplona . You jumped out of a plane over the Mojave Desert , fo Christ ’ s sake . You can do this
ARNIE: Okay , Pete , you ’ re up .
EVELYN: Hi Jack

JACK: Wait a second She turns .
EVELYN: Are we what , Jack ?
JACK: Is there something going on between us ?
EVELYN: Are we finally being honest ?
JACK: It would help me if we were .
EVELYN: Okay , you ’ re right , we ’ ve een dancing around this for years
JACK: Do I have your number ? A wide smile from Evelyn .
EVELYN: Steve ’ s out of town with the kids this week . Why don ’ t you just stop by
ARNIE: Hey Jack , you ’ re all flush . I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you .
JACK: I just saw Evelyn Thompson .
ARNIE: She is relentless .
JACK: She wants to have an affair with me .
ARNIE: She said that ?
JACK: Pretty much .
ARNIE: Oh yeah What is it about you ?
JACK: So could you write down her exact address ?
ARNIE: Whoawhoawait a second , Jack . You ’ re not actually gon na cheat on Kate ?
JACK: It wouldn ’ t really be cheating It ’ s complicated .
ARNIE: Look , maybe I ’ m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one . A little flirtation ’ s harmless but you ’ re playing with fire here . The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor . You make a deposit somewhere else , they close your account forever .
JACK: I ’ m telling you , those ules don ’ t apply to me , Arn .
ARNIE: Screw the rules . I ’ m talking about the choice . Jack looks at him curiously .
JACK: Hey , is that really necessary ?
ARNIE: All I ’ m saying it there isn ’ t a guy in Union County who wouldn ’ t give his left nut to be married to Kate
KATE: How was the game , honey ?
JACK: Long , boring , and generally pretty sad . Arnie seemed to enjoy it Hey , where ’ s that chocolate cake ?

JACK: Are the kids asleep ? A sexy smile from Katethey start kissing

BILL KRAMER: Four hundred bucks at Best Buy , Arn .
JACK: And everyone knows image stabilization is for the weak

JACK: I know that , but
KATE: You forgot . Jack stands there , silent .
JACK: I ’ ll fix it . I ’ ll go out ight now and get you something . I ’ ll make it ight . That didn ’ t help .
KATE: Jesus , JackIs this where we are now ? Is this our marriage ? Suddenly I ’ m the wife who has to drop hints two weeks before he anniversary so he husband doesn ’ t fuck it up ?
JACK: Please don ’ t cry
KATE: I don ’ t want to be that , Jack
JACK: C ’ monc ’ mon
ANNIE: Put the bicycle back on the ground
JACK: Like what ?
ANNIE: One year he had a sola system named after her
JACK: Don ’ t you think that ’ s a little gimmicky ?
ANNIE: Mom liked it . Jack raises an eyebrow .
JACK: Maybe there ’ s a jewelry store back at the mall . I could get her a pair of earrings or something .
ANNIE: That ’ s good butyou did forget the anniversary .
JACK: Right . That ’ s a majo oversight So if I ’ m KateI can ’ t eally afford the fine things , my husband ’ s career is a crushing disappointment to me , I ’ m trapped in suburbia Then
ANNIE: You ’ re really gettin ’ the hang of this .
KATE: Which do you think ?
ANNIE: The black one
KATE: Fighting ’ s a part of it , Annie . You know that , ight ?
ANNIE: I ’ m not worried , Mom . He ’ s still learning ou ways

WAITER: Very good , sir . And may I say those are all excellent selections .
JACK: You may Also , we ’ ll have a bottle of Lafite , 1982 .

JACK: Just a glass of red wine for each of us
KATE: You are so not off the hook yet , slick .
JACK: But I ’ m gettin ’ close , right ?
KATE: I don ’ t think there ’ s dancing here , Jack . Jack gets up and holds out a hand .
JACK: Sure there is Kate looks around again , then she smiles .
KATE: Pretty good for a tire salesman from Jersey Jack flashes her his most charming smile .
JACK: I have my moments
KATE: Mmmm here , try one of these Jack takes a scallop from Kate ’ s fork .
JACK: God I missed that taste Kate laughs .
KATE: Okay
JACK: I think it may help us ut there ’ s a slight chance it could make things worse . She hears the seriousness in his voice .
KATE: Now I ’ m worriedjust say it . Whatever it is we ’ ll deal with it .
JACK: Are you sure ?
KATE: Worse , you mean
JACK: No . Well , maybe a few things . But mostly just different
KATE: And now ?
JACK: NowI don ’ t
KATE: Me neither . A raised eyebrow from Jack .
JACK: But you always seem so certain .
KATE: C ’ mon , Jack , you think there aren ’ t mornings when I wake up and wonde what the hell I ’ m doing in New Jersey
JACK: That ’ s a big one for me , too .
KATE: My office is a dump , I answer my own phoneand you ’ ve seen my pay check .
JACK: Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks .
KATE: I mean yes , I help people that need it

KATE: God , sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground eef or maybe drive a ca with a CD player He smiles , right there with her .
JACK: It ’ s wonderful Kate laughs , nodding . A pause , then
KATE: I think about it , too , Jack . I do . I think about the kind of person I ’ d be if I hadn ’ t married you
JACK: And ? She stops a moment , considering . Then
KATE: And I realize I ’ ve just erased the things in my life I ’ m most sure about . You , the kids Jack nods .
JACK: Good things
KATE: What are you sure about ? Jack looks into Kate ’ s eyes .
JACK: I ’ m sure that right now there ’ s nowhere I ’ d ather be than here with you

KATE: Way out

LASSITER: Alan , this is Jack Campbellthe one I was telling you about
ALAN: Jack , of course . They shake hands .
JACK: Mr. Mintz .
ALAN: Please , call me Alan . We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here
JACK: I can see that , Alan . A chuckle from Mintz .
ALAN: You have kids , Jack ?
JACK: Uhactually , yes . Two good ones . Another laugh from Mintz .
ALAN: That ’ s great Why don ’ t you have a seat ?
JACK: I was a sales associate , at E.F. Hutton .
ALAN: A broker ? Really . And now you ’ re in the tire usiness ?
JACK: That ’ s right . And auto supply
ALAN: Uh huh . The retail end , I understand . Jack nods
JACK: Uhwe actually get about sixty percent of ou usiness from automotive service .
ALAN: Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year ? Ballpark
JACK: We did one point seven million in total revenue
ALAN: Uh huhone point seven . And what do you project fo this year ?
JACK: Well , Alan , I think we ’ re gon na have a banner year . Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account .
ALAN: Really . So you ’ re projecting what , a tad over two million ? A gleam in Jack ’ s eye .
JACK: That ’ s right . And that would make us number one in our market You mind if I stand ? A raised eyebrow from Mintz .
ALAN: I ’ m not trying to knock the tire business , Jack .
JACK: It ’ s okay , Alan . I get it . I ’ m in your shoes , I ’ m thinking exactly the same thingbut here ’ s the thing . Business is usiness . Wall Street , Main Street , it ’ s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning , trying to figure out how the hell they ’ re gon na send their kids to college . It ’ s just people
ALAN: I ’ m sure you do
LASSITER: Let ’ s let the man have his say
JACK: Take you , for instance
ALAN: What about me ?
JACK: You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day . You ’ re an excellent father , but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home . You drink bourbon , ut you offer you clients scotch
LASSITER: He certainly has you number , Alan .
JACK: You ’ re a little tougher , Peter .
LASSITER: That ’ s easy . You ’ ve seen my car .
JACK: Okayyou smoke Hoyo de Monterreys . You ’ re a scotch man , single malt , not because it ’ s trendy ut because you ’ ve been doing it for forty years , and you stay with what works . You have two great loves in your life , you horses and this company . You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand Lassiter ’ s impressed .
LASSITER: Oh ? And how would you know that ? Jack smiles .
JACK: Because I ’ m here .
LASSITER: Alan , why don ’ t you show Jack around a bit
ALAN: I ’ d love to .
JACK: Seven . Really .
ALAN: Let ’ s cut the shit , huh Campbell ? What , did you go through his wallet o something ? Jack ’ s a little taken aback .
JACK: God , you really are different , aren ’ t you I meanwowI am impressed . Now it ’ s Mintz ’ s turn to look quizzical .
ALAN: I don ’ t think you ’ re hearing me .
JACK: Oh , I ’ m hearing you , Alan . That ’ s not the problem . The problem is that what you think is yours , is eally mine . And I don ’ t care how low on the totem pole I start , I will get it back So do yourself a favor and don ’ t get too attached to that view because sometime soon , maybe very soon , you and your French country antiques , your chintz sofa , and your little play pen are gon na be moving out of that office .
KATE: It ’ s like a museum . Jack nods .
JACK: Think bigger .
KATE: For the week ? Jack chuckles .
JACK: This place is a perk , Kate .
KATE: A perk for what ?
JACK: A company called P.K . Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives Kate ’ s confused .
KATE: What are you talking about , Jack ?
JACK: I ’ m going into arbitrage , honey . Turns out I have a knack for it . I ’ ll be making two hundred grand a year plus a hefty bonus and that ’ s just to start . And , we can live in this apartment practically rent free fo as long as we want . Jack measures her reaction . It ’ s not good
KATE: Are you out of your mind ?
JACK: I don ’ t think so . This is going to be a bette life for all of us , honey . We ’ ll put Annie and Josh in private schools
KATE: Annie goes to a great school .
JACK: I ’ m talking about the est schools in the country here , Kate
KATE: Jack , what could you possibly be thinking ? What about my job ?
JACK: This is New York City , it ’ s like the needy people capital of the world . Those Jersey clients of yours aren ’ t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here
KATE: I can ’ t believe you want to move back into the city . I thought the eason we left was ecause we didn ’ t want to aise the kids here ?
JACK: No , this is the center of the universe . If I were living in Roman times , I would live in Rome , where else ? Today , America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself . John Lennon .
KATE: Jack . Jack ’ s starting to struggle
JACK: Look , I ’ m detecting a kind of funky tension hereWe don ’ t have to live in this apartment . I don ’ t need thisI ’ ll commuteI ’ ll drive to work
KATE: In traffic ? It ’ s over an hour each way ? That ’ s almost three hours a day . When are you going to see the kids ? He ’ s frustratedhe pauses a moment to gathe himself . Then
JACK: Kate . You ’ re not understanding me . I ’ m talking about a great life . A perfect life . Everything we pictured when we were young . The whole package . You said it yourself , life has thrown us surprises , and so we made sacrifices . But now I can finally get us back on track A sad chuckle from Kate .
KATE: Then get a goddamn snow lower !
JACK: Look , you ’ re making this into something it ’ s not . This isn ’ t a referendum on our lives , Kate . It ’ s a step forward Don ’ t you see ? I ’ m talking about us finally having a life othe people envy .
KATE: They already do envy us , Jack
JACK: Very nice . What is it ?

JACK: We have two kids , Annie and Josh Kate looks at him , half-mortified , half- interested
KATE: Okay , Jack
REED: High open space , exposed structural elements . Obviously aimed at first time visitors to create feelings of smallness , inadequacy .
BEN: Good thing it ai n't workin Reed , what are we doing here ? This guy 's fast-food , strip-mall science
REED: This was n't our first stop , in case you forgot NASA . And Victor 's not that bad . He 's just a little Larger than life .
BEN: You 'd never know it .
REED: Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see
FEMALE RECEPTIONIST: Executive elevator , top floor .
BEN: What 's the price for a smile round here ?
SHADOWED FIGURE: Turn it off . Please . The figure 's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness .
REED: But I have n't fully explained my
SHADOWED FIGURE: Yes you have Imagination . Creativity . Passion . Those were always your trademarks .
VICTOR: But dreams do n't pay the bills , do they ? Same old Reed , the hopeless optimist . Still reaching for the stars , with the world on your back .
REED: You remember in school we talked about working together . That 's what I was about to explain
VICTOR: So it 's not my money you want . It 's my toys Tell me if NASA does n't trust you , why should I ?
BEN: I ca n't take this .
REED: Ben . This is business . Just work .
VICTOR: I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research , Susan Storm .
BEN: Heya Susie . One more thing he 's got .
SUE: Ben , it 's been too long .
REED: You 're , you 've , I mean , how have you ee
SUE: Never better .
VICTOR: This is n't going to be a problem , is it ?
REED: Not at all .
SUE: Ancient history . Victor smiles , eyeing Sue .
VICTOR: Good . Then you 're just in time to hear the great Reed Richards ask me for help . You know , you made a lot of folks at MIT feel like a junior high science fair . So you 'll excuse me if I savo the moment .
REED: You back this mission , and I 'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or
VICTOR: The number 's seventy-five . And it 's applications and patents .
BEN: What about his first born ?
REED: Ben , the money 's not important . We could save lives .
VICTOR: Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on , is n't it ? Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the Baxter Building .
REED: Hilarious .
VICTOR: If Reed 's right , then this little trip will double our stock offering .
LEONARD: And if he 's not ?
VICTOR: Reed 's always right . Good thing he does n't always know what he 's got
BEN: He knew about NASA . What if he made the call to shut us down
REED: Ben , think about all the people we can help if this works
BEN: Maybe you should think about yourself for once . You always let this guy push you round
REED: We got what we wanted . That 's enough .
BEN: I know , I know . I 'm just worried about what he wants Speaking of which
SUE: You sure about this , Reed ?
REED: Those solar winds are flaring , but I factored them into my coordinates and
SUE: I was talking about us . Working together .
REED: Well , uh , based on our historyyou can handle the biogenetics , and I 'll focus on the molecular physics . Or , uhm , maybe I should take the biotech , you work the microscopes , since you have some background in electropho
SUE: Right . That 's exactly what I meant .
BEN: Way to not overthink it . So when do we leave ?
SUE: I 'll schedule the launch . Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew .
REED: I , uh , think I remember the number .
SUE: It 's been changed .
REED: As far as crew , I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission
SUE: Well , he 's welcome to ride shotgun , ut we already have a pilot on ou payroll . You remember my brothe Johnny Off Ben 's curdling smile , we DISSOLVE TO
BEN: Ca n't do it . I can not do it .
REED: External SRBs , orbital system engines . Its just like the shuttles you flew in
BEN: No . I can not take orders from that underwear model . That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator .
REED: Youthful high spirits . They walk toward the base of the scaffolding .
BEN: They crashed it into a wall . A flight simulator .
REED: I 'm sure he 's matured since then .
BEN: Five times .
REED: I had it at four .
BEN: This makes five .
SUE: Victor did .
JOHNNY: Keep the hot side hot , and the cool side cool !
REED: Wow . Fantastic .
SUE: Great minds think alike .
LEONARD: They 're ready for you , sir .
VICTOR: Showtime .
LEONARD: Our numbers are through the roof . The IPO 's tracking at fifty , sixty a share . The bank 's five times oversubscribed
VICTOR: It 's not just the money . I could make money in my sleep .
LEONARD: Then what is it ?
VICTOR: History , Leonard . History . Everything else is conversation How 's the other matter ?
LEONARD: Harry Winston sends his regards .
VICTOR: Today we stand on the edge of a new frontier . In the furthest depths of outer spacewe will find the secrets to inner space . The final key to unlocking our genetic code lies in a cosmic storm
BEN: Is n't that your speech ?
REED: He 's made a few changes .
BEN: This is your dream , Reed . You should e the one up there .
REED: Victor 's better at these things .
BEN: I 'll be watching over you .
DEBBIE: Just get back soon , or I start looking for a new groom .
BEN: Soon as I 'm back , I 'm gon na trade that in for a bigger rock .
DEBBIE: I do n't care about rocks , I care about you . You bring him back in one piece , o you can forget being Best Man .
BEN: What the hell you smiling at ? Just keep your mouth shut , and your mind on those SMBs
JOHNNY: Actually , the engines are SMEs . Hydrogenbase , carbon propellant . Couple generations past your last ide . I 'm not as dumb as you look .
VICTOR: Think of a world without genetic flaws no asthma , allergies , baldness , east cancer Ben and Reed hear the speech . Ben bristles .
BEN: What 's wrong with being bald ?
VICTOR: Darwin discovered evolution . Now we I will define it . Only in America could
JOHNNY: If you behave , maybe next time daddy 'll let you drive .
BEN: Keep talking , there wo n't be a next time . Reed is focused on THE EARTH .
SUE: Long way from the projection booth at the Hayden Planetarium , is n't it ?
REED: Yes . Yes it is .
VICTOR: Leonard , how 's the feed ?
SUE: We can monitor the cloud 's approach and observe the tests from here .
BEN: Is it safe ?
REED: The shields on the station should protect us .
BEN: Should ?
VICTOR: What 's wrong , Ben ? Eighty-million dollars worth of equipment not enough for you ?
REED: Let 's start loading those samples . Get your suit ready , Ben . Victor keeps his eyes on Ben .
VICTOR: So you still do all the heavy lifting ? Victor gives a friendly smile , patting Reed .
BEN: He does the talking . I do the walking . Got it ?
VICTOR: Got it . So take a walk , BenI 'm going to borrow Susan for a second .
REED: Sure . Ben and Johnny read his eyes , as we CUT TO
JOHNNY: Please tell me your dawg 's not trying to rekindle things with my sister .
BEN: 'Course not . Strictly business .
JOHNNY: Yeah , well , his eyes say different .
BEN: Hey , two hearts got busted last time . Maybe she 's not over it either .
JOHNNY: Let 's see you got Victor , stud of the year , more coin than God ? Or Reed , the world 's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp . Hmmm , it 's a toss-up .
BEN: Put your tiny little mind at ease .
JOHNNY: Do n't you wander off , boy .
VICTOR: Surprised I agreed to Reed 's proposal ?
SUE: I understand the business reasons .
VICTOR: Well , when you 're looking at you future , it never hurts to find closure about the past . Sue 's eyes narrow . What is this about ?
REED: Nonoimpossible . It'stoo fast .
VICTOR: You 've been with me two years now .
SUE: It 's been a good two years , Victor The company 's accomplished so much .
VICTOR: Right , of course , the company But you see , I 've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with
SUE: Uh , Victor , I hope I have n't done something to make you think
VICTOR: Sue , I 've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps . And this is the iggest step yet . If it helps , think of this as a promotion . A merger of sorts Four little words that can change ou lives
REED: The cloud is accelerating !
VICTOR: Get a grip . Reed . We did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . Just close the shields
REED: Ben 's still out there
VICTOR: So reel him in . But we came here to do a job . So let 's do it . Quickly .
AUTOMATED VOICE: Event threshold in two minutes .
REED: Come on , Ben , come on
SUE: Johnny Reed
VICTOR: Reed , you need to get up here so we can close the shields ! Now !
SUE: What are you doing ?
VICTOR: Raising the shields .
SUE: You ca n't leave them out there .
VICTOR: Watch me . Reed had his chance . You ca n't help them any more than I can .
SUE: I can try .
REED: Victor 's right . Johnny , get to the command center . Close the shields .
JOHNNY: What about you ?
AUTOMATED VOICE: Event threshold in thirty seconds .
SUE: Johnny ! Reed !
REED: He 's not responsive
JOHNNY: Ben ! Ben !
JOHNNY'S VOICE: Ben , wake up ! Wake up !
JOHNNY: Back on Earth . Victor 's medical facility We 're in quarantine .
REPORTER #1: You 've been accused in the past of moving science a little too fast
VICTOR: Accused by who ? My competitors ?
REPORTER #2: But surely this accident gives you pause
VICTOR: Danger is always part of discovery . What would have happened if Ben Franklin never went out in a storm ? Without risk , there 's no reward .
REPORTER #3: So where 's the reward ? You promised a cure-all .
VICTOR: And you 'll have it . I 've never come up short . And I 'm not going to start now .
REPORTER #2: So you 're still taking VDI public
VICTOR: Yes , of course . I 've never been more confident in the compan Reed mutes the television .
REED: How 's she doing ?
DOCTOR: Stable . Vitals are strong . Reed takes the clipboard , looks for himself .
REED: Blood panels show no irradiation . Good . You 'll step up this protocol , every
DOCTOR: Four hours . We know what we 're doing One more day of observation , then you 're all cleared .
REED: SueI want to tell youI 'm
SEXY NURSE: And where do we think we 're going ?
JOHNNY: I do n't know if `` we 've '' noticed , but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window
NURSE: I 've noticed But doctor 's orders , you 're not allowed to leave until we
JOHNNY: Finish the tests , I know could you give me a hand with this zipper ?
NURSE: You know this is not a ski resort .
JOHNNY: Not yet .
NURSE: You are trouble .
JOHNNY: Brubbles my Triddle Name .
SEXY NURSE: You 're hot !
JOHNNY: So are you !
SEXY NURSE: I mean , you feel a little feverish .
JOHNNY: I 've never felt better in my life . When do you get off work ?
SEXY NURSE: My shift ends at four , but I could n't
JOHNNY: Meet me at 4 01 , top of the run . That 'll give you a minute to freshen up .
BEN: How long was I out ?
REED: Three days . I was worried about you . How are you feeling ?
BEN: Solid . Ben can see Reed does n't look too solid .
REED: I do n't know . I just keep going ove and over the numbers .
BEN: Reed . Even you ca n't compute every little thing .
REED: I should have done more , run more tests
BEN: It was a freak of nature . Last I checked , you do n't have a crystal all . Let it go .
REED: Yeah , you and Debbie and perfect
BEN: Reed , I 'm not talking about Debbie .
REED: What ? Come on . She 's got a good thing with Victor
BEN: I 'm sorry , did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws ?
REED: He 's smart , powerful , successful
BEN: Well maybe you should date him . Reed looks at Ben , resigned .
REED: Ben . He 'll give her the life she deserves . She ended up with the right guy . Things worked out for the best .
BEN: Do I have to do everything myself ?
JOHNNY: Me like-y .
SEXY NURSE: Stay right . Left is trouble .
JOHNNY: I though we went over this .
SEXY NURSE: Last one down springs for room service .
JOHNNY: Not this again
SEXY NURSE: No You 're ON FIRE !
JOHNNY: Care to join me ?
VICTOR: How 's the IPO ?
LEONARD: Stable . We 're looking at low twenties . It 's a good number , considering the fallout from
VICTOR: Reed 's disaster . You know , I half- think he did this to me on purpose .
LEONARD: Sir , I 'm sure he would n't put himself
VICTOR: Get me on the AM shows , Larry King , cover of the Journal I 've got to do something about this scar . Make sure they only shoot my ight side .
LEONARD: Actually , uh , people seem to think the scar `` humanizes '' you .
VICTOR: And that 's a good thing ?
LEONARD: You know , maybe you should get some est
VICTOR: Later . First , I 've got some unfinished business . A deal that needs closing
LEONARD: Sir , I 've always wondered Why Sue ? You could have any woman in the world ut
VICTOR: That 's why . Because I could have any other woman You know , when they asked Caesar `` why England , '' he said , `` because it 's not mine . ''
SUE: I can only stay for one drink , Ben . I 've got to meet with Victor .
BEN: Would n't want to keep Vic waiting .
REED: Are you alright ?
BEN: I think I need to lie down . Bad shrimp .
REED: Feeling better ?
SUE: Yes , thanks .
REED: That 's good . That 's uhgood .
SUE: You always had a way with words . I should be getting back .
REED: I 'm really happy for you and Victor .
SUE: You 're happy for me and Victor .
REED: I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship
SUE: Which was ?
REED: Passion . We see surprise on Sue 's face , and
SUE: You are such a dork , Reed You neve got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics .
REED: What ? What did I say ? She looks more disappointed than angry .
SUE: It 's never what you say . It 's what you do n't say . What you do n't do
REED: III just wanted to
SUE: It 's been two years , and all you can say is you 're happy for me and some other guy You know , Victor may be a lot of things , but at least he 's not afraid to fight for what he wants And it 's nice to be wanted sometimes . To be heardseen Reed , look at me .
REED: Uh , Sue ? I ca n't .
SUE: What ? What do you mean you
REED: Suelook at your hands .
SUE: It has to be the cloud . It 's fundamentally altered our DNA .
REED: Let 's not jump to conclusions , we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap .
JOHNNY: Now what is up with that ?
REED: The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA .
JOHNNY: Cool . What 'd it do to you guys ?
SUE: Apparently I can disappear .
JOHNNY: Please tell me you go silent too . Only one thing on Reed 's mind
REED: We have to find Ben .
JOHNNY: Flame on , flame off . Flame on , flame off
SUE: Johnny . He does it again . Flame on , flame off .
JOHNNY: Okay , `` mom . ''
BEN: LEAVE ME ALONE ! ! !
JOHNNY: Ewwwwwwww . That is disgusting .
REED: Ben ?
JOHNNY: What is that thing ?
SUE: I think that thing is Ben .
VICTOR: What 's going on ?
SUE: Victor , are you feeling alright ?
VICTOR: Just a little banged up . A couple scrapes . Why ?
REED: Ben did this .
VICTOR: Ben did this ?
REED: He 's had some kind ofreaction to exposure from the cloud . And he 's not the only one .
SUE: We need to find him . Victor redirects his attention to Sue .
VICTOR: Just find him . Victor strides off , leaving the others .
JOHNNY: Anybody know where the big guy 's going ?
REED: He 's going home .
BEN: Hello , Operator ?
DEBBIE: Out front ? You home , baby ? I got a surprise for you . He blinks hard . Sad , dark .
BEN: I got a surprise for you too .
DEBBIE: Ben ?
BEN: Deb , it 's me . It 's still me .
DEBBIE: Don'tdon'tDO N'T TOUCH ME !
BEN: I love you , Deb .
VICTOR: Make sure you find Ben , bring him back here . And keep it quiet . I do n't need this to hit the press .
LEONARD: Yes sir . You 've got the Mayor at eight , then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal
VICTOR: Front page ?
LEONARD: Top left , like you asked . Today Wall Street . Tomorrow , who knowsmaybe Washington .
VICTOR: Leonard . Think bigger .
BEN: A few days in space , it 'll be great , what 's the worst that could happen ?
JOHNNY: Not even Ben deserves that .
BRIDGE COP: Back ! We 're evac-ing the bridge .
SUE: What now ? Reed ? What do we do ?
BRIDGE COP: Maybe you did n't hear me . Those cars are gon na blow sky high , any second .
REED: Look , we 've got a friend out there in trouble . We need to get to him before
SUE: What ?
REED: We need to get past them .
SUE: What ? Oh .
JOHNNY: This is wrong in so many ways .
REED: You 've been working out .
SUE: Shut up .
REED: Uh , Sue ?
JOHNNY: I 'm gon na need serious therapy .
BEN: What the !
REED: Ben . Are you okay ?
BEN: Am I okay ? ! You wan na explain that ? !
REED: I swear to you , I will do everything in my power until there is not a eath left in me you are going to be Ben again .
LEONARD: Uh , sirLarry King called , to cancel . Apparently , there 's a bigger story .
CHIEF FIREMAN: There 's some folks outside , want to talk to you .
REED: We 're not going public with this . We 're scientists , not celebrities .
CHIEF FIREMAN: Too late , son .
JOHNNY: Nice . Johnny heads for the exit .
SUE: Johnny , slow down . Let 's think this through , a second . Johnny pauses . Rubs his chin once . And
JOHNNY: Okay . Done thinking .
CHIEF FIREMAN: So which one of you 's the leader ? Johnny does not hesitate .
JOHNNY: That 'd be me .
CHIEF FIREMAN: No seriously .
REED: Uh , during our recent mission to the Von Doom space station , we were exposed to as yet-unidentified adioactive energy , most likely some kind of nucleotide compoun
VARIOUS REPORTERS: What happened on the bridge ? Does it hurt to stretch ? Were you really on fire ? Is it true that one of you can fly ?
JOHNNY: Working on it . And it 's a lot harder
SUE: We do n't know much more than you do , at this point . Which is why we will e going directly to the lab , where we can diagnose our symptoms and
REPORTER #2: Symptoms ? So it 's like a disease ?
JOHNNY: Symptoms ? Please . If having powers is a disease , then yeah we got it . And we are gon na blow your minds . There 's a new day dawning . The day of the Fantastic Four .
REPORTER #3: That thing does n't look too fantastic .
REED: Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who 's been through a terrible orde
JOHNNY: What he 's trying to say is every team needs a mascot
REED: Look , we went up to space to find a way to understand DNA , to cure disease , save lives . Well , now it 's our DNA , our disease , our lives on the line Thank you . No more questions .
BEN: Be nice .
NED CECIL: Well , Victor , the bank would like to congratulate you . On the fastest freefall since the Depression . We ca n't even give your stock away .
VICTOR: Ned , you know I can turn this around . Ned motions to the paper , the picture of BEN .
NED CECIL: You promised a cure-all , and came back with this . Who the hell 's going to invest in a biotech company that turns its workers into circus freaks ?
VICTOR: I really appreciate all your support .
NED CECIL: You 've got a week , Victor . One week to turn this around . Or we pull out This meeting is over .
VICTOR: Goddamn book-keeper does n't know preferred stock from livestock . Leonard is thinking all business .
LEONARD: Sir . Reed 's comments at that press conference killed us . How are we going to turn this around ?
VICTOR: Very simple . I cure them . If I can cure these freaks , then I can cure anyone . What better way to restore my eputation ?
JOHNNY: Smile , Ben . They want to like you . Give 'em your good side . Or your less ad side .
BEN: Uhdo n't do drugs .
O'HOOLIHAN: Welcome back to the Baxter , Dr. Richards . All that for you ? He motions to the flashing cameras outside .
REED: I 'm afraid so He searches for the name . Sue steps up .
SUE: Jimmy . Good to see you again . He smiles at Sue , then at Reed .
O'HOOLIHAN: Good to see you too Do n't worry , sir . I know how crowded that head of yours is .
REED: Any visitors while I was away ?
O'HOOLIHAN: Just the usual . Told 'em you were circling round outer space .
REED: We had a tough year .
BEN: Yeah , nine years straight .
JOHNNY: Twenty ? From outside the place looks a lot taller .
REED: Oh , it is .
JOHNNY: Either we 're moving really fasto not at all .
BEN: I 'll take the stairs .
SUE: How come Ben ca n't turn it on and off like us ?
REED: That 's what we 're here to find out .
SUE: If it happened to him , then it could Happen to all of them . Reed nods softly .
JOHNNY: Wait . You mean there 's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic ?
SUE: Grow up , Johnny . You want to run around on fire for the rest of you life ?
JOHNNY: Is that a trick question ? C'mon , I ca n't be the only one who thinks this is cool .
REED: We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes
JOHNNY: This place is deluxe . You got cable ?
REED: and figure out how to reverse them . Let me show you to your rooms .
VICTOR: God , I 've been so worried about you . She notices the scar on his head .
SUE: Victor , your scar
VICTOR: I told you , I 'm fine . It 's you I 'm worried about .
SUE: I 'm sorry I did n't get a chance to
VICTOR: Please , no apologies . I 've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos . You 'll have round-the clock care .
SUE: Thank you , that 's generous , but I think I should stay here . With my other . Until we get a handle on this .
VICTOR: Sue . I think you should let my doctors have a look at you .
REED: Not much . We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage .
VICTOR: Well , let me know if there is anything I can do . We 're all in this togethe now .
REED: Victor wait I just wanted to say , I 'm sorry the mission did n't go as planned
VICTOR: Did n't go as planned ? It was a catastrophe . You ruined the lives of four people
REED: I ruined ? With all due respect , I told you to abort
VICTOR: Abort ? Reed , I put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line , and I will not let you make me look like a fool
REED: Victor , if we could understand what happened to us
VICTOR: I do n't want to understand it . This is n't one of your science projects . I just want to fix it . Fast !
BEN: You got a chisel round here ?
REED: If we 're going to identify the source of the mutation , we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes . Ben looks to Sue for translation .
SUE: We need to give you a physical , so we know what got zapped .
BEN: Well why did n't you say so ? You want me to lift some weights or something ?
REED: No , just sit back . We have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck . We need to find the source of your strength .
BEN: How bad is it ? You know I used to smoke .
REED: Okay , this might smart a little .
JOHNNY: I can go hotter !
SUE: You were at 4000 Kelvin . Any hotter , you 're approaching supernova
JOHNNY: Sweet .
SUE: That 's the temperature of the sun .
REED: Not only could you kill yourself , but you could set fire to Earth 's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it .
JOHNNY: Gotcha . Okay . Supernova bad . Reed looks at the control panels .
SUE: He cooked the equipment .
REED: Okay . I 've uh , got some questions , from Sue . That she thought might be etter coming from me Can you , you know , go to the bathroomlike normal
BEN: Yeah . You do n't wan na know the details .
REED: Ben , I 'm afraid I 've got to ask
BEN: Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your
REED: O-kay . We 'll skip that question .
JOHNNY: What are you trying to say ? Just ecause I dress well and like to dance
REED: What ? No . I 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms .
JOHNNY: Oh , well that 's easy I 'm hot . You'rewell , you 're a little limp . Sue 's easy to see through . And Ben 's always been a hardass . Why are n't you writing this down ? Reed sighs . It 's going to be a long process .
REED: It 's not `` invisibility '' per se . You 're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field . That 's what you projected on the Bridge .
SUE: What about you ? You have n't eaten in days . How come you 're never on this side of the microscope ?
REED: Have you had any side-effects , from your powers ? She considers . A little vulnerable .
SUE: I 've had some headaches . Migraines .
REED: You should be able to bend light around other objects , even people , if you could control your emotional state etter
SUE: Excuse me ? She is annoyed . Reed is oblivious .
REED: I 'm saying , if you had a little more self control , you could locate the trigger . Can you remember the exact emotions when
SUE: Anger . Rage . Frustration .
REED: Okay . Is there any way to duplicate that feeling ? Some memory or
SUE: I 'm sure I can come up with something .
REED: How 's that coming whoa
SUE: I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to do that You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or
REED: What in the world would give me that idea ? An awkward beat .
SUE: Are you kidding ?
REED: No , I distinctly remember you walked out my door . Ergo
SUE: Reed . I was ready for the next step , you were n't , ergo , I walked .
REED: I think it was a little more complicated than
SUE: I just wanted to share an apartment . What was so complicated about that ?
REED: There were a lot of variables to consider
SUE: No . There were n't . There was you . And me . No variables , no math . It was actually the simplest thing in the world . But your head got in the way like it always does .
REED: SueI justI thought He struggles for the words .
SUE: Same old Reed . Too much thinking
JOHNNY: Okay guys , we have a serious problem .
BEN: You look like an eighties rock band .
SUE: The suit will stretch . You should try it
BEN: I would n't be caught dead in that .
JOHNNY: He 's right . These costumes are missing something . I ca n't put my finger on it
REED: They 're not costumes .
SUE: We 're not taking them out . Johnny , we need to stay here till we 've stabilized .
JOHNNY: I 'm getting sick of being trapped here . NASA was n't even this strict !
BEN: Maybe it 's missing a utility belt . Off Reed 's dark look , we hear
DOCTOR: Your tissue , your organs , your entire iophysical structure is changing . Every system is still functioning , somehow
VICTOR: And they 're changing into
DOCTOR: I do n't really know . A compound organic-metallic alloy . Stronger than titanium or carbon steel . Harder than diamonds
VICTOR: Like the shields Reed said would protect us . How long ?
DOCTOR: At this rate , the infection should be complete in two , maybe three weeks
VICTOR: What do you mean `` complete '' ?
DOCTOR: I wish I could tell you . I ca n't pretend to know what we 're dealing with here . I 'll notify the CDC and Victor hardens , razor sharp .
VICTOR: What ?
DOCTOR: The Center for Disease Control . If this thing is contagious WHHM ! Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat .
VICTOR: Look at me . I have a life . I 'm the face of a billion-dollar-company We need to keep this confidential , understand ?
DOCTOR: Butthis diseaseis progressive degenerative
VICTOR: That 's terrible news
REED: Nothingnothingnothing
SUE: What are you doing ?
REED: The plants , from space . Thei particles are still charged . With the ight amount of energy , those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm .
SUE: And reverse the mutations
REED: Curing countless diseases , not just ours . She looks at him .
SUE: But we 're the focus , right Reed ? Reed ?
REED: Of course . Of course .
SUE: And you sure you can control this thing ? Last time did n't work out so well .
REED: With the right energy , we can stabilize the storm . Maybe tie into the city grid
SUE: You really need to get a janitor .
REED: There 's a system to it .
SUE: Sorry . My fault . I won'ttouch anything .
LEONARD: Is Reed any closer to a cure ?
VICTOR: The only thing he 's closer to is Sue
THE THING: God . I was good looking .
JOHNNY: How far 's that rubber bend ?
REED: That 's what I 'm trying to calculate . And it 's not rubber . It 's muscle , tendon . I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to
JOHNNY: Right , whatever , have fun .
BEN: That 's not funny !
ERNIE: Hey , that 's Ben Grimm there , the first mook from Brooklyn to go to oute space , so pay him some respect !
BEN: Ernie . Sorry for killing you usiness . I 'll take the usual , then I 'm out Better make it a double .
ALICIA: Who killed the party ?
BEN: If there 's a God , she hates me . He grabs a bar-rag to dry off .
ALICIA: I do n't think She 's real big on hate .
BEN: You would n't say that , if you could see me .
ALICIA: Can I ? See you ?
BEN: Trust me , this ai n't one of those times .
ALICIA: See you round , Benny
VICTOR: Thank you for coming out to see me . She nods , a little self-conscious .
SUE: You said it was urgent .
VICTOR: It is . There 's something we need to talk about . Something I need to ask you
SUE: Victor , wait , slow down a second . I want you to know I appreciate everything you 've done for me , but I just do n't
VICTOR: Susan . What are you doing ?
SUE: He 's working round the clock . But the data needs to be tested , analyzed efore
VICTOR: Same old Reed . All analysis , no action . Was n't that the problem with you two ? She holds tight , keeping cool .
SUE: If these molecules are n't stable , they could make us worse , maybe even kill us .
VICTOR: Then why is Reed dragging his feet ? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass It 's ironic , is n't it ? You 're finally the perfect woman for himbecause you 're his science project .
SUE: Please do n't make this personal
VICTOR: Oh , I think you already have .
SUE: Victor , we ca n't do anything until the esearch is ready . Victor 's fist CLENCHES metal SFX .
VICTOR: `` We , '' huh ?
BUSINESSMAN: I wish my wife would disappear .
JOHNNY: Hey , Ronnie Renner ! I 'm a big fan .
KENNY BARTRAM: Heard you like to ride . Wan na take her for a spin ?
RONNIE RENNER: Come on , bro . I 'll teach you some tricksif you can keep up .
JOHNNY: My bad . Sorry about that . Thanks for the lesson , bro .
SUE: That 's new
REED: No way to know . Without more tests , experiments .
SUE: We 're not specimens , we 're patients . This is n't just another science project to you , is it ?
REED: BEN ! What ? What 's going on ! ?
SUE: He did n't .
BEN: Oh , he did .
SUE: What did he do to the uniform ? !
REED: He talked me into it .
SUE: Girl ? !
JOHNNY: Well , I would n't say he 's the leader . Reed shrugs . He does n't hate the name .
BEN: Could be worse . Case in point a photo of Ben fills the TV .
JOHNNY: That 's it . Just The Thing . We would have gone with The Rock , but it was taken . And `` Thing '' pretty much sums it up . A LAUGH from the studio audience .
BEN: Okay . I 'm gon na go kill him now .
REED: Ben ! Slow down a second and He sees a photo of himself on screen .
SUE: I 'm driving .
JOHNNY: Where 's my ride ?
SUE: You gave us names ? What are you , the `` face '' of the Fantastic Four now ? Ben marches up . Hands balled into fists .
BEN: It 's about to be a broken face .
REED: This is n't permanent , Johnny . We need to be careful until we 're normal again .
JOHNNY: What if some of us do n't want to be `` normal '' again ? We did n't all turn into monsters like
BEN: Did you just
JOHNNY: Let 's see if we can get blood from a stone .
SUE: You two need a time-out .
JOHNNY: Blockhead started it !
SUE: Damn it , Johnny .
REED: You need to control yourself and think efore you
JOHNNY: Act . Here we go again . Reed , what if we got these gifts for a reason ? What if we have some , you knowlike , calling ?
REED: A higher calling like getting girls and making money ? Johnny nods , totally missing the sarcasm .
JOHNNY: Is there any higher ?
SUE: Ben ! Slow down
BEN: It 's not him . It 's them . I ca n't live like this .
SUE: Just give Reed a little more time . You know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one
BEN: It 's easy for you to be patient .
SUE: No , it 's not . I thought I was done waiting for Reed We 're all in this together now , Ben . He slows down , gets closer , intense .
BEN: Together ? Look at me , Susie . You got no idea what I 'd giveto be invisible . Your nightmareis my dream .
NED CECIL: This is how you `` turn things around '' ? These freaks are on the front page and your company 's in the obituaries . Victor has a larger bandage on his face now .
VICTOR: I have a plan to use their publicity for
NED CECIL: Victor , stop . The bank 's lost enough already . This is n't a negotiation . It 's a notification . We 're pulling out . A cold , silent beat . Victor leans forward .
VICTOR: You need to look long-term here . Without risk , there 's no
NED CECIL: Reward . We all know the sales pitch , Vic . And frankly , we 're done buying Gentlemen .
VICTOR: It 's pronounced Latveria . This meeting 's over , Ned .
LEONARD: Sir , is everything okay ? What happened to your ?
VICTOR: Reed He got what he wanted Everything he wantedhe took from me .
REED: Victor , are youare you okay ? Victor turns away .
VICTOR: Do n't worry about me . Worry about yourself .
REED: What are you doing here ?
VICTOR: What I should have done a long time ago . Applications and patents , Reed . This all belongs to me .
REED: But I 'm not done with the machine
VICTOR: Which is precisely the point . Analysis is over . It 's time fo action . My men could have mass- produced this by now . Reed shakes his head , defending himself .
REED: Mass-produced ? This is n't a toaster . You have no idea how it works .
VICTOR: Re-create the storm , invert the polarity here , reverse the mutation there . Do n't talk to me like I 'm some schoolboy . I 've got the same Phd you do .
REED: The storm needs to be handled exactly ight , or it could make our mutations worse , much worse , maybe even kill us
VICTOR: Reed . I 'm not asking permission . We 'll build it , while you check the specs .
SUE: Can I talk to you ?
REED: He was going to take away all my data , equipment
SUE: Better than your life . Victor 's not the one who has to get into that thing . We are . Reed starts to snap , losing his studied cool .
REED: Which is why I 'm working twenty hours a day , checking every variable
SUE: Every variable but yourself . You do n't eat , sleep . You ca n't live in your head like
REED: I 'm not the only one in there . I got you , Vic , Ben , Johnny , all rattling around in there .
SUE: So clear it out . Get out of you head . Get out of here
LITTLE GIRL: Mister , Mister ! Please help me ! My kitty is stuck in a tree .
BEN: Eyebrows are a little big
ALICIA: I 'm blind , not deaf . Wan na come in ?
BEN: I 'm not really dressed for a party .
ALICIA: Relax , it 's casual .
BEN: No , I meanI 'm a littledusty
ALICIA: My step-dad 's . I 'm strictly into stone . I was wondering when you 'd walk by .
THE THING: You know , you could ' a run an ad in the personals .
ALICIA: `` Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton , ock-hard he-man for deep spiritual elationship . ''
THE THING: This ai n't permanent . My friend Reed 's working on a cureI think .
ALICIA: Bennie . You feel pretty good as is .
THE THING: You do n't know what it 's like out there . Walking around like some kind of circus freak . People staring , whispering
ALICIA: I would n't know anything about that .
THE THING: I mean
ALICIA: Tell me . When you grew up in Brooklyn , how many astronauts did you know ? You went your own way then . You did n't listen to people . So why start now ?
VICTOR: Need a ride , Johnny ?
JOHNNY: Got ta take care of the fans , right ?
VICTOR: Look , I built my business knowing what people want . And right now , the people want you . Johnny eyes the models , all lusting .
JOHNNY: And we do n't want to let the people down now , do we ?
JOHNNY: Videogames ? You serious ?
VICTOR: Johnny . Let 's be honest here . Ben , Reed , Sue . Good people , all . But stars ? I do n't want to break up the band , but you 're the one they want . Do n't you think it 's time to go solo ?
REED: I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter 's main power to generate enough voltage
SUE: Reed . Shh . Just be quiet . And look up .
REED: You were ?
SUE: Of course I was . I 'd read all you papers on bioethics . Some of them two times just so I 'd have something to say to you . Reed smiles softly , thinking back .
REED: You know , I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late ?
SUE: I gave him twenty .
REED: Sue , you were right . It was n't complicated . I just was n't ready to eto become You can be a little intimidating . She knows . He trails off . Sue looks at him .
SUE: I did . I did , Reedbut I wanted you to be that man .
REED: Why did n't you say something ?
SUE: That would have kinda defeated the purpose . And Reed I 'm saying it now .
ALICIA: Look around . I 'll get us drinks . They always let blind girls cut the line .
PATRON: I do n't know about this one . It lacks a certainrealism .
BEN: What are you doing here ?
VICTOR: I 'm worried about you .
BEN: About me ? How sweet .
VICTOR: Come on . Let me buy you something to eat . Looks like you could use the company . Ben considers . A man deeply alone . A beat .
THE THING: 'Scuse me .
VICTOR: I know it ca n't be easy . Life has n't changed that much for Reed , Sue and Johnny . At least they can go out in public . But for you ? People staring . Whispering behind your back
THE THING: If you 're trying to cheer me up you 're doing a helluva job
VICTOR: I 'm just saying , I know what it 's like to lose something you love . To see it slip away , and know it 's never coming ack .
THE THING: Reed 's gon na fix me up
VICTOR: For your sake I hope you 're right . I 'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical .
THE THING: Skeptical ?
VICTOR: Look , he 's a brilliant man , we should trust he 's working as hard as he can . You 're his best friend . So what possible reason could he have fo taking his time ? I mean , other than getting close to Sue ?
BEN: Yeah , I have that effect on people .
REED: Ben
BEN: Oh , you remember my name do you ? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body ?
REED: We 're working as hard as we can
BEN: Yeah . I can tell . Victor was right . He motions to Reed and Sue together .
REED: Come on , this is nothing . Sue looks a little hurt .
BEN: Glad `` nothing '' could take you away from your work .
REED: Ben , I do n't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse . I need you to be patient for a little while longe
BEN: Look at me , Reed . Look at me !
REED: I am looking . That 's why I ca n't make a mistake ! I 've got to get it right , and it 's not right yet ! We need to test this . Ben shakes his head , looking down at Reed .
BEN: I spent my whole life protecting you , from the schoolyard to the stars . Fo what ? So you could play Twister with your girlfriend while I 'm the freak of the week ?
SUE: Ben ! Stop it ! Or I 'll stop it .
BEN: Stay out of this Susie .
REED: I 'm OK. Just go , go after him . Stop him .
JOHNNY: Christmas come early ! Check it out !
BEN: Go back to the drawing board . He strides away .
SUE: Johnny ? Did you see Ben ?
JOHNNY: Yeah , for the last time , I hope . I 'm done with this freak show . I 'm moving ack to the real world .
SUE: Is that what you call it ? `` Real '' ?
JOHNNY: At least it beats living in a lab like somebody 's science project .
SUE: Johnny , slow down . Think . You know mom did n't raise us to
JOHNNY: Look around , sis ! She 's not here . So you can stop talking to me like I 'm your little boy
SUE: As soon as you stop acting like one . Come on , you 're smarter than this . You think those people out there care about you ? You 're just a fad to them .
JOHNNY: Let 's try something new you live your life . And I 'll live mine . And just for the record they LOVE me .
SUE: Oh god , Reed .
REED: I canmake it work .
SUE: Reed , stop , you need to rest your
REED: The powerI needmore powerto controlthe storm
SUE: You need a doctor .
VICTOR: More power ?
LEONARD: Ben ! They need you back at the Baxte uilding . It'sReed .
JOHNNY: What do you say we get out of here ? She pauses . Anda very LARGE MAN steps up .
BOYFRIEND: Is that all you do ? Bar tricks and stealing chicks
GIRLFRIEND: What are you doing ? ! You could have urned somebody !
VICTOR: Ben , come in .
BEN: What is this ? Where 's Reed ?
VICTOR: Where do you think ? With Sue .
LEONARD: Yes sir .
BEN: What do you want , Vic ?
VICTOR: To help you . I 've run every test known to man . And they all yield the same result the machine is ready .
BEN: Reed said it 'd be weeks till
VICTOR: He also said we 'd avoid that storm in space . And we know how that turned out .
BEN: And you can ? Power it up ?
VICTOR: Yes . I 've found a new energy source .
BEN: Let 's do it .
DOOM: Everyone thought I was safe behind those shields
BEN: Victor , the machine worked for me . It can work for you
DOOM: It did , Ben . It worked perfectly . Ben starts to realize
BEN: You planned this ?
DOOM: I 've always wanted power . Now I 've got an unlimited supply
BEN: And no Thing to stand in your way . DOOM smiles , nods , stronger than Ben now .
DOOM: Take a good look , Ben . This is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny .
REED: Oh god Ben . Are you okay ? You did it , you really did it
DOOM: No , Reed . I did .
REED: Victor ? What , what happened to you ? What did you do to your
DOOM: Exactly what I said I would I built a etter , stronger being . And outsmarted the great Reed Richards
REED: Victor , this is n't the way to
DOOM: You always know best . So tell me . What happens when you superheat ubber ?
O'HOOLIHAN: Mr . Von Doom ? Are you oka
DOOM: Never better , Jimmy . And it 's Docto Doom now .
SUE: Ben ? !
JOHNNY: Jesus , Ben ! I go away , look what happens . You got a lot of explaining to do . He motions to the wreckage .
BEN: The machine works . And Vic 's gone Mister Hyde on us
JOHNNY: Really ? With a name like Von Doom ? Never saw that one coming .
SUE: Where is Reed ?
BEN: Victor must 've taken him .
DOOM: Chemistry 101 , Part Two . What happens to rubber when it 's super- cooled ?
JOHNNY: Great . Heat-seeker .
SUE: What are you doing
JOHNNY: Sis . Let me take care of you fo once .
SUE: But Johnnyyou ca n't fly .
JOHNNY: Well then this 'll be one hell of a asejump .
BEN: We need to help Reed Sue shakes her head , sympathetic .
SUE: Ben , you got what we all wanted . You need to stay here . It 's too dangerous . She heads off . Ben watches her go , helpless .
BEN: Whatwhat have I done ?
SUE: What has he done to you ?
DOOM: It 's Doctor Doom to you .
SUE: We know the machine works . It worked on Ben , it 'll work on you . We can turn you back
DOOM: Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts ?
SUE: Victor . You always thought you were god .
DOOM: Sue please , let 's not fight .
SUE: No , Victor Let 's .
DOOM: Susan You 're fired .
REED: Sue . The only thing I ever knew without thinking was Ilove
SUE: Me too , Reed .
DOOM: And so four became none . It 's my time now .
OLD LADY: The clutch sticks a little .
BEN: Not gon na be a problem .
DOOM: And you ca n't stop me .
JOHNNY: Had a little relapse , huh ?
DOOM: This is going to be fun .
SUE: Can'tholdon
REED: Johnny . SUPERNOVA .
JOHNNY: But all these people
REED: Now .
THING: Flame on , kid .
REED: Sue , I need some of that anger , rage , frustration
SUE: I 'm sure I can come up with something .
DOOM: Is that the best you can do ? A little heat ?
REED: Time for your lesson , Vic . Chem 101 what happens when you supercool hot metal ? Ben
BEN: Got it , teach .
DOOM: No .
JOHNNY: Damn , I love this job .
BEN: Job , huh ? Will they accept their mantle ? Reed shrugs .
REED: Well , we do have the suits
SUE: You know , about what we said up there , I think maybe
BEN: Funny how things turn out , is n't it ?
SUE: Hilarious .
REED: Ben , I 've been crunching the numbers on the machine . I think if we can ework the power settings
BEN: Forget it , egghead . I 'm good as is .
REED: Sue , can I talk to you for a second ?
SUE: A gasket ? Reed , we 're at a party .
REED: If one of us were to wear it
SUE: Reed . What are you doing ?
REED: No more thinking , no more variables Sue Stormwill you Sue ? Sue ? You there ? Dead silence . And then
BEN: No more cracks about how I look .
JOHNNY: Hey , I 'm Mr . Sensitivity now . Clear the way , wide load coming through .
BEN: Showoff .
FOX: What 'd the doctor say ?
MRS. FOX: Nothing . Supposedly , it 's just a twenty- four hour bug . He gave me some pills .
REASSURINGLY: I told you . You probably just ate some ad gristle .
FOX: Should we take the short cut or the scenic route ?
MRS. FOX: Let 's take the short cut .
FOX: But the scenic route is so much prettier .
SHRUGS: OK , let 's take the scenic route .
FOX: Great . It 's actually slightly quicker , anyway .
MRS. FOX: What is a squab ?
FOX: You know what a squab is . It 's like a pigeon , I suppose . Anyway , it 's a type of ird we can eat . Fox motions toward the edge of the property .
MRS. FOX: Well , I guess the horse fence would be a little safer .
FOX: But the bridle path puts us out right next to the squab shack .
SHRUGS: OK , let 's take the
FOX: No , we 'll do the horse fence . You gave me the scenic route already . Fox flashes a smile . He says suddenly
MRS. FOX: Get away from there .
FOX: Is it spring-loaded ? Yeah I guess if you come from over there , and you 're standing at the door to the squa shack , this little gadget probably triggers the Move out of the way , darling . That 's ight where it 's going to land .
MRS. FOX: Come on ! Stop it ! Let 's go !
FOX: No , it just falls straight down right here , does n't it ? I guess it 's not spring- loaded .
MRS. FOX: I 'm pregnant .
FOX: Wow . We 're going to have a cub . Honey , that 's great news !
MRS. FOX: If we 're still alive tomorrow morning , I want you to find another line of work . Pause . Fox nods .
FOX: Does anybody actually read my column ? Do your friends ever talk about it ?
STILL STIRRING: Of course . In fact , Rabbit 's ex- girlfriend just said to me last week , `` I should read Foxy 's column , '' but they do n't get the Gazette . Ash ! Let 's get cracking !
FOX: Why would they ? It 's a rag-sheet .
SIGHS: I want to say I hate my job , but that would make it seem more important to me than I want people to think it is .
ASH: I 'm sick .
MRS. FOX: You 're not sick .
ASH: I have a temperature .
MRS. FOX: You do n't have a temperature .
ASH: I do n't want to go .
MRS. FOX: Hurry up . You 're going to be late .
FOX: I love the way you handled that .
MRS. FOX: Your cousin Kristofferson 's coming first thing tomorrow morning . I want you to be extra nice to him , because he 's going through a very hard time right now , OK ?
ASH: Where 's he going to sleep ?
MRS. FOX: We 're going to make a bed for him in you oom tonight .
ASH: I ca n't spare the space . Put him in Dad 's study .
FOX: Dad 's study is occupied by Dad .
MRS. FOX: We are poor but we 're happy . Fox twists his paw in the air , indicating
FOX: Comme-ci , comme-ga . Anyway , the views are etter above ground .
WEASEL: Obviously , it 's first growth , indigenous . Original dirt floor , good bark , skipping stone hearth
KYLIE: Oh , cuss . What time is it ? I 'm sorry .
WEASEL: This is Kylie . He 's the super . He 's a little
FOX: What 's in the bucket , Mr. Kylie ?
HESITATES: Just minnows . You want one ?
FOX: Certainly . Thank you .
WEASEL: May I ask what you do for a living , Mr. Fox ?
FOX: I used to steal birds , but now I 'm a newspaper man .
PLEASED: Oh , sure . I 've seen your by-line .
FOX: Good afternoon , gentlemen .
BADGER: Do n't buy this tree , Foxy . You 're orrowing at nine and a half , which stinks like cuss , plus moving into the most dangerous neighborhood in the
FOX: You 're exaggerating , Badger .
YELLING: Bull-cuss ! I 'm sugar-coating it , man ! This is Boggis , Bunce , and Bean ! Three of the meanest , nastiest , ugliest farmers in the history of this valley !
FOX: Really ? Tell me about them .
BADGER: All right
BADGER: In summation , I think you just got to not do it , man . That 's all .
FOX: I understand what you 're saying , and you comments are valuable , but I 'm going to ignore your advice .
BADGER: The cuss you are !
IN DISBELIEF: The cuss am I ?
FOX: Do n't cussing point at me !
SCREAMING: Are you cussing with me ?
SCREAMING: Do I look like I 'm cussing with you ?
FOX: One last thing something 's probably about to happen to me at work which I ca n't put my finger on but have a funny feeling about . How can I protect myself legally ?
PAUSE: Are you about to get fired ?
SHRUGS: Slash quit .
SQUIRREL: You 're fired .
FOX: Slash I quit . Here 's my letter of esignation .
ASH: Watch this , Dad !
FOX: Good jump , Ash ! Remember to keep you tail tucked !
KRISTOFFERSON: Hello , everyone ! Good afternoon !
FOX: Kristofferson ! Welcome to our little tree ! I see you brought your swimming trunks !
ASH: Do you think I 'm an athlete ?
FOX: What are you talking about ?
ASH: Well , you know , I think I 'm an athlete , and sometimes I feel like you guys do n't see me that way .
FOX: What 's the sub-text here ?
ASH: How long is Kristofferson supposed to stay with us ?
MRS. FOX: Until your uncle gets better .
ASH: Right , but roughly how long do we plan to give him on that ? Double-pneumonia is n't even really that big of a deal , is it ?
MRS. FOX: As a matter of fact , it is . He 's lucky to e alive . Now
ASH: Right , but
KRISTOFFERSON: Ki-ya !
MRS. FOX: Lower your voice , Ash .
FOX: Kids are crazy , are n't they ? You got to try it , though . Raising a family .
KYLIE: Yeah . Sometimes I feel like maybe I
FOX: What do you think of this tree , by the way ? It 's great , huh ?
HESITATES: Yeah . No , I was just saying how some-
FOX: I have one last part of what I was about to say .
KYLIE: OK. Go ahead .
FOX: I 'm going broke . You want to help me steal some chickens ?
PRICKLY: This is actually kind of a big deal , so do n't just say , `` OK ! ''
KYLIE: OK. Well , thank you .
FOX: I 'm going totape this formyrecords , so do n't make a lot of sounds meaning stop rocking .
DEFENSIVELY: Well , maybe we ought to turn off the adio , then . That 's noisier than
FOX: I do n't want people to eavesdrop on us , Kylie . Let me just tell this .
KYLIE: Beagles are n't so tough .
ANNOYED: Yeah ? Well , first of all , one of these eagles has chronic rabies , which he 's on medication for , and if you get bit by him you have to get shots in your stomach fo six months . And , second listen , I 'm not going to justify this to you . Just pay attention and stop interrupting me . I 'm taping this .
KYLIE: How do we make them eat it ?
FOX: Beagles love blueberries .
KYLIE: Yeah , back in the old days , did n't they used to do a thing where if somebody saw a wolf , and
STARTLED: What wolf ?
FOX: Oh , nothing ? Never mind .
SUDDENLY ANGRY: What the cuss ? Where 'd this giant fence come from ? We had a master plan !
KYLIE: What 's this lightning bolt stand for ?
FOX: Give me a second ! I said , `` Let 's pause '' !
KYLIE: Well , I just hope it does n't mean thunder . I have a phobia of that .
FOX: Watch this .
KYLIE: I 'm trying ! I have a different kind of teeth from you ! I 'm an opossum !
DEFENSIVELY: We 're killing chickens ! There 's going to e blood in this story ! Follow me !
KYLIE: What 's the master escape plan ?
FOX: Follow me again !
KYLIE: Wow . That was amazing . How did we do that ? We ran the other way or something .
FOX: Yeah .
KYLIE: What happens now ?
FOX: I have no idea .
MRS. FOX: Where 'd you get this chicken ?
SHRUGS: I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last night on my way back from
MRS. FOX: It 's got a Boggis Farms tag around its ankle .
HESITATES: Huh . Must 've escaped from there before I ought it .
KYLIE: What 's that ?
ASH: This ? Nothing . Just some old trophy I won for being an athlete .
FOX: I 'm supposed to cover this book party at some animal 's nest in a tobacco field down the hill , so me and Kylie are going to hop over there and give it a whirl . Do n't wait up .
MRS. FOX: What 's the book ?
HESITATES: Some memoir . I 'll get him to sign you a copy .
FOX: Dinner was pitch-perfect .
KYLIE: We 're breaking into Bean 's house ?
HESITATES: Cellar .
KYLIE: Where he lives ?
HESITATES: Where he keeps the cider .
BRIGHTLY: Below where he lives .
FOX: Where 'd you come from ? Go back to the tree and do your homework !
ASH: I want to help you steal some cider .
ANGRILY: We 're going to a book party ! And keep your mouth shut about any cider , because no one ever said that ! Get out of here !
ASH: But Dad
FOX: But nothing ! You 're going to get me in a lot of trouble !
KYLIE: One time this wolf
IRRITATED: What 's with all the wolf talk ? Can we give it a rest , for once ?
KYLIE: Look at all this apple juice .
STERNLY: Apple juice ? Apple juice ? We did n't come here for apple juice . This is some of the strongest , finest alcoholic cider money can buy or that can even be stolen . It urns in your throat , boils in you stomach , and tastes almost exactly like pure , melted gold .
SUDDENLY: Let 's crack open one these 'shine jars and do a shooter .
RAT: Y'all are trespassin ' , now . Illegally . 'Round these parts , we do n't take kindly to cider poachers .
FOX: You 've aged badly , Rat .
RAT: You 're gettin ' a little long in the tooth , yourself , partner .
FOX: Do you refer to my wife ?
RAT: She was the town tart , in her day . Wild and foot-loose and pretty as a mink stole . She was a creme brulee until you made an honest woman out of her , Mr. Fox . Kylie says , intrigued , from his hole
KYLIE: Is that true ?
ANNOYED: Of course , not . I mean , certainly , she lived . We all did . It was a different time . Let 's not use a double-standard . She marched against the
KYLIE: But town tart ?
FOX: Shut up .
RAT: Oh , I 'm as careful as a
HOUSEKEEPER: How many jars should I bring up , ma'am ?
MASCULINE VOICE: I do n't know . Two , I guess .
HOUSEKEEPER: He drank three yesterday , ma'am .
MASCULINE VOICE: All right , take three .
HOUSEKEEPER: But maybe , just in case
MASCULINE VOICE: Two 's plenty .
KYLIE: Oh , my cuss . That was like a scene out of
MRS. BEAN: To whom it may concern if I catch a rat in a black beret drinking Mr. Bean 's secret cider without his express permission , I intend to chop said rat 's head off , brine it , pickle it , and bake it in a vermin casserole . I hope this clarifies my position on the matter . Sincerely , Evelyn Bean .
RAT: Dear Mrs. Bean , your language , while somewhat purple , is nevertheless impossible to misinterpret . However comma given the proximity of said rat at the moment of your
BEAN: I 'm going to give a speech , and at the end of it I 'm going to throw a twist into this plot .
MRS. FOX: Another book party ?
FOX: Woah ! I did n't see you . Sitting in the dark over there . Yeah , no . Actually , there 's a fire . I just got the call . They said maybe it 's arson ? I got to interview the marshall and see what 's
MRS. FOX: Kylie , is he telling the truth ?
FREAKING OUT: I do n't want to be put in the middle of this .
PAUSE: Thanks , Kylie .
MRS. FOX: If what I think is happening is
OMINOUSLY: it better not be .
FOX: Nice job covering for me . Next time
TRY: A twig snaps . Fox freezes .
FOX: All three !
BEAN: We got the tail , but we missed the fox . Pause . Bean takes out his walkie-talkie .
ASH: It 'll grow back , wo n't it ?
KYLIE: Tails do n't grow back , except fo lizards .
MISERABLY: Tails do n't grow back . I 'm going to be tail-less for the rest of my life .
NERVOUSLY: Well , anyway , it 's not half as bad as double-pneumonia , right ? His dad 's got one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana peel . That 's a lot worse than
KRISTOFFERSON: Excuse me , everyone . I 'm going to go meditate for half an hour .
MRS. FOX: You 've got twenty-nine minutes to come up with a proper apology .
FOX: What 's with the crazy outfit ? Why a cape and the pants tucked into your socks ?
ICILY: That tail was the first thing I eve noticed about you . It was easily the most attractive tail for at least 50 miles in every direction . It was probably you single best quality and now it 's gone forever .
FOX: Why the cuss did n't I listen my lawyer ? At this point we 'll be lucky if we can flip this tree for half of what we 've already sunk into it . Fox flips over onto his stomach .
BITTERLY: Because you do n't listen to anybody .
FOX: What was that ?
PAUSE: What ? I said
FOX: Wake up ! Everybody ! They 're digging us out !
MRS. FOX: They 'll kill the children !
STEELY: Over my dead body , they will .
ANGRILY: That 's what I 'm saying ! You 'd be dead , too , in that scenario !
ANGRILY: Well , I 'm arguing against that !
SCREAMING: What are you talking about ?
SCREAMING: Why are you yelling at me ?
AGONIZED: Stop ! Stop ! Stop !
KYLIE: You say one thing , she says another , and it all changes back again !
FOX: I 've got it ! There 's not a moment to lose ! Why did n't I think of this before ?
MRS. FOX: Think of what ?
FOX: Think of the one thing a fox does quicke than a man , quicker than any other animal in the world !
MRS. FOX: May I have a word with you privately ?
HESITATES: Well , we 're in a hole . Where
MRS. FOX: Just on the other side of this mineral deposit . Follow me .
PAUSE: When ?
MRS. FOX: Right now .
PAUSE: Well , when
MRS. FOX: Twelve fox-years ago , you made a promise to me while we were caged inside that fox- trap that , if we survived , you would never steal another chicken , goose , turkey , duck , or squab , whatever they are . I believed you . Why did you lie to me ?
SIMPLY: Because I 'm a wild animal .
MRS. FOX: You 're also a husband and a father .
PAINED: I 'm trying to tell you the truth about myself .
MRS. FOX: I do n't care about the truth about yourself .
SURPRISED: Predictable ? Really ? What happens in the end ?
QUIETLY: In the end , we all die unless you change .
BUNCE: These foxes dig like a bunch of hyperactive gophers .
BOGGIS: Franklin ? You got another twist for this plot ?
BEAN: Say that again ?
BOGGIS: I say you got another
BEAN: Petey ? Get me the current contact info for Earl Malloy on the A.S.A.P .
INNOCENTLY: What ? You mean over at Malloy Consolidated ? Oh , he does rentals .
PAUSE: What does he rent ?
BEAN: Let 's kick some fox cuss !
BUNCE: I 'm cussing loving this !
BOGGIS: Who 's hyper-cussing-active now ?
EARL MALLOY: These machines were n't made to be handled like this .
REPORTER: Farmer , correct me if I 'm misreading the data , you 've successfully destroyed the scenery , but the alleged fox remains at large . What will you three prominent farmers do now ?
BEAN: Well , Dan , I can tell you what we 're not going to do . We 're not going to let him go .
REPORTER: Are you concerned about the possibility
BEAN: I have no further dialogue in this scene .
BOGGIS: Thirty-five .
BEAN: Bunce ?
BUNCE: Thirty-six .
BEAN: And I 've got thirty-seven . That 's 108 men altogether . Now what do I got here ? Two quitters or are you staying with ?
FOX: One of those slovenly farmers is probably wearing my tail as a necktie by now .
KYLIE: You 're paranoid , Foxy .
FRECKLED BOY: Look at Dad 's tie .
PETEY: 'Bout a handsome little fox Let me sing you folks a yarn . Hey , diddle-dee , doddle-do , doodle-dum ! 'T was a splendid little felle Full of wit ' n ' grace ' n ' charm . Say , zippy-zee , yappy-yo , google-gum !
SLOWLY: Way , zippy-zee , yappy-yo , google
PETEY: I do n't know . I was just kind of making it up as I was going along
BEAN: That 's just weak song-writing ! You wrote a bad song , Petey !
PETEY: How long can a fox go without food o water ?
KYLIE: Well , I can only answer as an opossum , ut I do n't think I can last more than another couple of hours before I get completely dehydrated and starve to death .
ASH: What 's that ?
WHISPERS SHARPLY: Not a sound !
FOX: You scared the cuss out of us !
BADGER: I told you not to buy at nine and a cussing half !
FOX: You do n't just bang into somebody 's cussing tunnel !
BADGER: Are you cussing yelling at me !
FOX: You 're cussing right I 'm cussing yelling !
BADGER: We 're all cussing starving to death ecause of you , you mangy , cussing , little cuss !
MOLE: I just want to see a little
SUDDENLY CRYING: sunshine .
PUZZLED: But you 're nocturnal , Phil . Your eyes arely even open , on a good day .
ENRAGED: I 'm sick of your double-talk . We have ights !
BEAVER'S SON: We do n't like you , and we hate your dad . You 're too snazzy . You dress like a girl . You 're creative . Now grab some of that mud , chew it in your mouth , and swallow it .
ASH: I 'm not going to eat mud !
BEAVER'S SON: Cuss , yeah , you are .
KRISTOFFERSON: Do n't do that .
BEAVER'S SON: Why 'd you take your shoes off ?
KRISTOFFERSON: So I do n't break your nose when I kick it .
ASH: I can fight my own fights .
BADGER: Those farmers are n't going to quit until they 've got you and every member of you family nailed upside-down to a bloody stick with your eyes gorged out .
FREAKED OUT: This is getting a little too personal .
FOX: Give me a minute .
SHARPLY: Shh !
FOX: I 've got an idea .
TENTATIVELY: What is it ?
FOX: It could be a good one .
FOX: It might save our lives .
EXASPERATED: Say the idea !
FOX: All right ! Let 's try it !
SKEPTICALLY: Is help on the way ?
FOX: I sure as cuss hope so .
SECOND: Fox seizes a black chicken violently .
WEASEL: What am I going to do ? I 'm going to hold him to the terms of the contract . It 's not my fault they uprooted it .
ASH: They say I owe you an apology for some of the mean things I said about you father 's illness . His double-pneumonia o whatever they 're calling it now . Kristofferson ladles Ash a cupful .
ASH: So there it is . I hope we can continue our relationship as cousins or family members or however you want to define
IT: but do me a favor for yourself . The next time you have a problem with something I 've said , come to me as a fox
KRISTOFFERSON: I 'm going to teach you karate .
BADGER: I can imagine how painful , even just emotionally , that must be for you .
UNEASY: Well , you know , it 's not the end of the world .
MORE ANIMATED: Oh , but , Foxy , how humiliating ! Having your whole tail blown clean off by a
COOLY: Can we drop it ?
ASH: Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean 's famous nutmeg-ginger-apple snaps ?
CHIEF: Who 's got me a donation for the old Wounded Fireman 's Retirement Pension Fund ?
BEAN: Right here . Let me show you this hole .
BADGER: Well , it took a near-catastrophe for all of you to finally take me up on my offe to have you over to the flint-mine fo dinner , but I guess we have
STANDING UP: in all seriousness excuse me , B .
FOX: I guess we do have those three ugly , cusshole farmers to thank for one thing eminding us to be thankful and aware of each other . I 'm going to say it again .
GESTURING EXPANSIVELY: Aware . Badger whispers to his wife
BADGER: Foxy cuss-blocked my toast , man .
FIREMAN #1: Ready .
CHIEF: Let her rip .
ASH: They 're still warm .
FOX: I 've stepped on some toes and alienated a few of you over the past few days but is it wrong for me to suggest we might 've done worse than having an incredible anquet in a beautiful flint-mine surrounded by our favorite animals ? Look at each other . Here we are . Wow . Now I 've already had too much to drink , and I 'm feeling sentimental , but I 'm going to say something , anyway , which nobody wants to admit , but I think is probably true we eat 'em . We beat those farmers , and now we 're triumphantly eating their roasted chicken , their sizzling duck , thei succulent turkey , their foie gras de
SUDDENLY: Where 'd the boys go ? Ash ? Kristofferson ? What am I hearing again , baby ? What 's happening ? Am I still paranoid ?
FOX: Let 's pause again .
FURIOUS: We 're all hurt ! My entire flint-mine just got demolished !
FOX: Let 's do a head-count ! Everybody pick a uddy !
ASH: I 'm here .
FOX: Ash ! Who 's your buddy ?
ASH: Kristofferson , but I lost him .
FOX: You lost him ? Where were you ?
ASH: We went for cookies . Everyone turns to Fox . Fox yells desperately
FOX: Kristofferson !
BEAN: Wrap this wet , little mutt in a newspape and put him in a box with some holes punched in the top .
FOX: Your brother 's going to kill me , if he survives his double-pneumonia .
BEAVER: There 's only one way out of this sewer , ut the manhole cover 's closed , and there 's a station-wagon parked on it which means we 're permanently stuck down here .
BITTERLY: You still think we beat 'em , Foxy ?
FOX: Somebody take over . I 'm not in charge anymore .
REALIZING: except , possibly , on some level , I think I just did .
PAUSE: Well , then maybe we 're not all going to die .
FOX: Excuse us , everyone .
ICILY: You 'll do no such thing .
QUIETLY: Darling , maybe they 'll let everyone else live . Mrs. Fox stares at Fox . She says desolately
MRS. FOX: Why 'd you have to get us into this , Foxy ?
FOX: I do n't know , but I have a possible theory . I think I have this thing where I need everybody to think I 'm the greatest the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox and if they are n't completely knocked- out , dazzled , and kind of intimidated by me , then I do n't feel good about myself .
QUIETLY: We 're wild animals . Fox smiles sadly and nods . He shrugs .
FOX: I guess we always were . I promise you if I had all this to do over again , I 'd have never let you down . It was always more fun when we did it together , anyway .
MRS. FOX: I love you , too , but I should n't have married you .
FOX: Did I ever tell you about the time I learned we were going to have a cub ?
ASH: In the fox-trap .
FOX: Right . We were at gun-point , and you
ASH: says she 's pregnant .
FOX: Let me tell it , OK ? I had no idea how we were going to get out of this jam , and then it hit me what do foxes do bette than any other animal ?
ASH: Dig .
FOX: You 're stepping on my lines .
ASH: Keep telling it .
FOX: So we dug . And the whole time I put paw over paw , scooping dirt and pebbles with your mother digging like crazy beside me , I kept wondering who is this little boy going to be ?
ASH: Or girl .
FOX: Or girl , right because at that point we did n't know .
HESITATES: Well , good-bye .
BADGER: I guess we should probably split into a certain number of groups and start doing something , right ?
RAT: Y'all lookin ' for somethin ' ? Nothin ' down here but rusty bottle-caps and drainin ' water .
FROZEN: Who 's got him ?
RAT: The farmers three . You know who I 'm talkin ' about .
HESITATES: They 've kidnapped him ?
RAT: Well-done , Mr. Badger . You 're a smart man . They want to trade the son for his poppa .
BADGER: Why 'd they write this in letters cut out of magazines ?
KYLIE: To protect their identities . Oh , right , but then why 'd they sign thei names ? Plus , we already knew who they were because they 're trying to kill us .
ASH: I 'm his son .
RAT: I can see the resemblance .
FROWNING: What 'd you just say ?
RAT: I said I 've still got the watch , Mr. Fox . She never asked for it back .
SADLY: Would you have told me if I did n't kill you first ?
RAT: Never .
FOX: All these wasted years . What were you looking for , Rat ?
ASH: He 's trying to say something , Dad .
RAT: Cider .
FOX: Here you are , Rat . A beaker of Bean 's finest secret cider .
RAT: Like melted gold .
ASH: He redeemed himself .
SHRUGS: Redemption ? Sure .
FOX: But , in the end he 's just another dead at in a garbage pail behind a Chinese estaurant .
BADGER: Well , I suppose we should
YELLING: Now , go !
BADGER: What was he saying about that wristwatch ? I did n't get what he was talking about .
FOX: Just some old back-story .
DRAMATIC PAUSE: I also see a room full of wild animals .
FOX: Wild animals with true natures and pure talents . Wild animals with scientific- sounding Latin names that mean something about our D.N.A . Wild animals each with his own strengths and weaknesses due to his or her species , and also well , I guess these things usually have a lot to
KYLIE: Let 's eat !
FORCEFULLY: All right ! Let 's start planning ! Who knows shorthand ?
FOX: Linda ! Lutra Lutra ! You got some dry paper ? Here we go !
HESITATES: I can see in the dark ?
EXHILARATED: That 's incredible ! We can use that ! Linda ?
TAKING SHORTHAND: Got it .
FOX: Rabbit ! Oryctolagus Cuniculus !
RABBIT: I 'm fast .
FOX: You bet your cuss you are ! Linda ?
TAKING SHORTHAND: Got it .
FOX: Beaver ! Castor Fiber !
BEAVER: I can chew through wood .
FOX: Amazing ! Linda ?
TAKING SHORTHAND: Got it .
FOX: Badger ! Meles Meles !
BADGER: Demolitions expert !
CONFUSED: What ? Since when ?
BADGER: Explosions , flames , things that burn !
FOX: Demolitions expert ! OK ! Linda !
TAKING SHORTHAND: Got it !
FOX: Weasel ! Mustela Nivalis !
WEASEL: Stop yelling !
FOX: All right ! Fox points to the various cubs and pups .
FIELD MOUSE: I want to go with you , too ! I want to fight !
PAUSE: Good . Fabulous ! Microtus Pennsylvanicus ! Do you do that , in fact ? Are field mice violent ?
FIELD MOUSE: Not particularly , except maybe domestic kitchen sink-type stuff , but I have a hunch I might just
FOX: You 're a cuss of a lot bigger than you look , Rickity .
KYLIE: I did n't get a job yet or a Latin name . What 's my strength ?
FOX: Listen , you 're Kylie . You 're an unbelievably nice guy . Your job is really just to be available , I think . I do n't know your Latin name . I doubt they even had opossums in ancient Rome .
MRS. FOX: Right here .
FOX: Paint an X .
BEAN: Why 'd he write this in letters cut out of magazines ?
SHRUGS: I do n't know , but you did the same thing .
UNEASY: I do n't trust this guy . Anyway , set up the ambush .
KRISTOFFERSON: Could I have a cup of water , please ?
FOX: Synchronize your clocks . The time is
FOX: nine forty-five A.M .
BADGER: Is that Rat 's watch ?
VAGUELY: No . Originally , no .
PAUSE: Well , OK , here 's the back-story when I was a teenager I spent a summer working as a bar-back at a jazz pub called Django 's where Rat played horn down near can I tell this another time ? We should stay focused on what 's happening ight now .
ASH: I should probably ride with you and Kylie since it 's my fault Kristofferson got captured stealing those nutmeg-ginger- apple snaps .
PUZZLED: I did n't understand a word of that sentence , but none of it matters , anyway , ecause it 's too dangerous for you to come with us .
BEAN: Of course , we did ! Say something , kid !
KRISTOFFERSON'S VOICE: Excuse me ! Excuse me ? Bunce presses stop .
FOX: Come on ! That does n't sound anything like him ! It 's amateur night in Dixie !
BEAN: What the cuss is he burning ?
MOLE: Twenty-eight pinecones fired ! Twenty-two targets hit !
KYLIE: Are you scared of wolves ?
FOX: Scared , no ! I have a phobia of them !
KYLIE: Well , I have a thing about thunder !
ANNOYED: Why ? That 's stupid !
ASH: I do n't like needles !
FOX: Where 'd you come from again ? How 'd you get in the sidecar ? I feel like I 'm losing my mind !
PILOT: I 've got a fox on a motorcycle with a littler fox and what looks to be an opossum in the sidecar riding north on farm lane seven . Does that sound like anything to anybody ?
FOX: That 's the annex over there on the right . Ash nods . Kylie does not respond .
KYLIE: What ?
SUDDENLY: I did it !
FOX: When ? I did n't see it !
KYLIE: Sure .
IMPRESSED: See , this is what I was saying about how good you are at just being available fo
FOX: A Titanium Card ? How the cuss did you qualify for this ?
SHRUGS: I pay my bills on time . I 've always had good credit .
FOX: Give me a blueberry .
ASH: What 's that white stuff around his mouth ?
FOX: That 's not soap .
HESITATES: Well , then why does he have that bubbly
FOX: He 's rabid . With rabies . I 've heard about this beagle . The beagle stands up . Fox says carefully
KYLIE: I thought he said you never look a beagle in the eye .
COAXINGLY: Why , you 're just as sweet as a
FOX: Climb the trellis !
IRRITATED: Come on , guys . Stay with me . We did good . That 's just some dog . Let 's not get traumatized .
KRISTOFFERSON: Hi !
ASH: Can I get one of those karate lessons eal quick ?
LONG PAUSE: OK . Normally , we start with some eathing exercises and such . Stand like this .
RICKITY: Is this spring-loaded ?
KRISTOFFERSON: This next part is mental . Position yourself on the balls of your feet .
MRS. FOX: Show me where they are !
KRISTOFFERSON: First , you need to get a running start , which , obviously , I ca n't do in here , then , as you arrive at the destination of the chop
DEMONSTRATING: lean and thrust into the point of contact , paw remains open and straight , then withdraw instantaneously . Remember , it 's the pull-back that matters . The pull-
DEMONSTRATING: generates the force of the impact .
IMMEDIATELY: Got it .
KYLIE: He 's going to do it !
ASH: Ki-ya !
DAZED: That 's all right . You were just trying to unlock the apple crate .
ASH: No , I mean I 'm sorry about
KRISTOFFERSON: Oh , you mean from before . The apology you owed me which you never actually said .
ASH: Yeah .
KRISTOFFERSON: That 's all right , too . Throw me the shoelace , please . Ash smiles .
BADGER: Badoit et fils .
MRS. FOX: Let 's go !
FOX: Your tractors uprooted my tree . You posse hunted my family . Your gunmen kidnapped my nephew . Your rat insulted my wife and you shot off my tail .
STEELY: I 'm not leaving here without that neck- tie .
ASH: I weigh less than a slice of bread .
HESITATES: What ?
ASH: I 'll be right back .
FOX: Ash , that was pure , wild animal craziness . You 're an athlete .
BOGGIS: Franklin ? You got any final twist fo this plot ?
PAUSE: Yeah !
BADOIT: Cuss .
MOLE: Stand by !
KYLIE: Do n't turn around !
FOX: What ?
LOUDLY: Where 'd you come from ? What are you doing here ? Pause . Fox points toward the wolf
FOX: Canis lupus ! Fox points to himself
LOUDLY: Pensez-vous que 1'hiver sera rude ?
ASIDE: I 'm asking if he thinks we 're in for a hard winter .
FOX: He does n't seem to know .
ASH: Where are we going ?
FOX: Nobody knows .
ASH: We were in the middle of a meditation practice .
FOX: Watch your step .
MRS. FOX: Oh , no , Foxy . It 's filthy .
FOX: Keep a good grip , everyone .
ASH: This better be worth it .
FOX: I think I see a little sliver of light . What 's this ? Is that a door ?
MRS. FOX: You 're a terrible actor , Foxy .
KRISTOFFERSON: Do you smell something ? Is that
SNIFFS TWICE: freon ?
FOX: Shh . I 'm going to crack open this trap door and see if something 's on the othe side . I highly doubt it , though . There 's probably just more sewer . Fox clears his throat . Pause .
ASH: Open it .
FOX: Hey , look ! There 's a whole , enormous , glorious , gigantic supermarket up here !
MRS. FOX: You really are kind of a quote-unquote fantastic fox .
SHRUGS: I try . I guess now that Kristofferson 's dad 's already down to single-pneumonia and getting better , he 'll be going home soon , huh ?
MRS. FOX: Actually , when he spoke to me from the hospital , he said he was already talking
FOX: Oh , really ? Well , now 's the time to buy .
KYLIE: Did I hear my name ?
SMILING: Not down here , you did n't .
SMILING BLANKLY: Why not ?
FOX: Because we were talking about othe things .
RESIGNED: Oh , well .
FOX: The white cape rather suits him , does n't it ? Actually , I had to do quite a bit of searching myself before I found a look that really flattered me . Remember those horseshoe cuff-links ?
MRS. FOX: I 'm pregnant again .
ASH: Dad ?
FARGO: a screenplay by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen The following text fades in over black
CLERK: And how are you today , sir ?
MAN: Real good now . I 'm checking in - Mr. Anderson .
CLERK: Okay , Mr. Anderson , and you 're still planning on staying with us just the night , then ?
ANDERSON: You bet .
NEWS ANCHOR: - whether they will go to summe camp at all . Katie Jensen has more .
KATIE: It was supposed to be a project funded by the city council ; it was supposed to benefit those Fargo-Moorehead children who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend a lakeshore summer camp . But nobody consulted city controller Stu Jacobson
WAITRESS: Can I warm that up for ya there ?
ANDERSON: You bet . The man looks at his watch .

FRANK: Hey I knew he 'd spring ya .
LANA: You did n't lift a finger , Frank . You let me take all the heat .

FRANK: Look you 're out free . Now we 're together . That 's what counts . We can try again ! Forget triple indemnity . We 'll whack him and split three mil .
LANA: I 'm not splitting anything , Frank . And you know too much .
FRANK: Come on , Lana . You 're not gon na shoot me .
LANA: You 're right . Maybe I 'll just screw you to death .
FRANK: Now you 're talkin ' baby .
FORENSIC MAN: Watch your step , guys . There 's a lot of blood .
INVESTIGATOR: Looks like a suicide . We found a note .
ARCH: `` I ca n't take it anymore . I 'm a mediocre mechanic and a lousy lover . ''
NED: He 's sure got that right .
LANA: Oh uh , Ned This is Lola , um
NED: Um ? She told you her name was Um ? And what other lies did she tell you ? I 've never seen this woman in my life ! Never followed her home ! Never had sex with her in the efrigerator ! It 's all a sick fantasy and I deny everything ! He turns to Lola .

NED: Yeah . Just the two of us .
LANA: I like that . Just you and me all alone . I 'll start packing .
NED: Great . Listen I got something to take care of . I 'll be back in awhile .
LOLA: Who is it ?
NED: I just want to talk .
LOLA: Why did n't you say so ?
NED: No thanks . I 'm driving .
LOLA: Then let 's get to the point !
NED: Stay away from my life , my wife , my home and my pets ! I 'm taking Lana on a vacation and when I come back , I do n't ever want to see your face again !
LOLA: A VACATION ! She does n't deserve a VACATION ! She 's a brat ! A bad girl ! She always was and always will be ! He grabs her by the shoulders , shaking her .
NED: What are you talking about ? You do n't know anything about Lana ?
LOLA: I know EVERYTHING !
NED: How do you know her ? Who is she to you ? TELL ME ! She clams up . He slaps her .
LOLA: She 's your wife !
NED: Who is she ! ?
LOLA: She 's my sister !
NED: Liar ! Who is she ?
LOLA: She 's your wife ! He raises his hand to slap her hard .
NED: WHO IS SHE !
LOLA: She 's my sister !
NED: Him ? Who , him ?
LOLA: Dwayne . The boy 's gym teacher . He was older . So mature so strong . He smelled like dirty sweat socks and old basketballs . And he was all mine . For awhile . But Lana was n't satisfied with he own things . She had to have mine too . She took it all my makeup , my sweaters , my shoes , my underwear
NED: You wore the same clothes ?
LOLA: We were identical twins .
NED: What 're you talking about ? You two do n't look anything alike .
LOLA: Not anymore . One day I caught he stealing my lavender eye shadow and she smashed my face in with a shovel . I had fifty-three operations . When the doctors were finished with me I looked like THIS ! I 'm ugly . UGLY !
NED: You 're beautiful .
LOLA: Do n't lie to me .
NED: They did a terrific job !
LOLA: I look in the mirror . I can SEE !
NED: But you 're gorgeous !
LOLA: Tell that to Dwayne . When he saw my face , he left me for HER because she looked more like me than I did ! First she stole my looks then she stole the only man who ever loved me !
NED: That 's why you did all this ? Seduced me harrassed me the tape the flowers the phone calls
LOLA: You been hangin ' out with Dick Tracy , have n't ya ?
NED: It wo n't work . Lana loves me .
LOLA: It does n't matter . I 'm blackmailing her for everything she 's worth . She murdered that greasy auto mechanic . I saw her do it .
NED: Lana killed Frank Kelbo ?
LOLA: Kelbo ! His name was Kelbo ?
NED: Yeah . Why ? Did he burn you on ca epairs too ?
LOLA: Dwayne 's name was Kelbo . He had a son . Frankie Kelbo .
NED: Lana ?
LAURA: Ned ! I 'm glad you 're here . I have so much to tell you .
NED: Come on in . I 'll make some tea . Gra a chair .
LAURA: Thanks I brought my own .
NED: So what have you got ?
LAURA: A lottery ticket and a laundry eceipt . I found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client .
NED: How about Ovaltine ?
LAURA: Fine . Then I remembered you told me some guy named Frank had been working on your wife 's car for two months . You with me so far ?
NED: I 'm way ahead of you .
LAURA: Well back it up . You probably took a wrong turn . Remember your insurance policy the one we could n't find ? I started thinking , who else had access to it beside you and me ? The answer came up Lana . And since she 's a woman , it 's probably hidden ight here .
NED: So that 's where she hid the Oreos .
LAURA: Ned , Lana was n't trying to save you life when she shot Max Shady . She and Frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy . But she shot the wrong guy .
NED: That 's the craziest thing I eve heard .
LAURA: Do n't you see Frank was going to let her take the fall . So she murdered him and tried to make it look like suicide . That 's when I realized there was a connection between Lola and Lana
NED: Yeah they 're sisters . Twin sisters .
LAURA: Well , hang on to your jock strap , Ned . There 's more .
NED: This is so unbelievable .
LAURA: And you have n't even heard my story .
NED: That damn faucet keeps turning on all by itself . I 'll go check it .
LAURA: Okay . I 'll make the Ovaltine .
GUEST MUSICIAN: I 'm sittin ' in for Dizzy . He had a gig tonight .
LAURA'S HUSBAND: Forget something , sweetheart ?
LOLA: What 're you gon na do , Ned ? Blow me away ?
LAURA: I never forget anything honey .
NED: You were right there 's a million things I do n't know about women . Maybe you can teach me a few hundred . He pulls out his police badge , looks at it .
LAURA: Oh Ned , I love you . I always loved you !
LAURA: I said I GOT 'EM !
NED: HUH ? ! ! !
LAURA: Okay . But I want to have kids . He hears THIS smiles at her .
NED: Great . They embrace .
LAURA: Ned
NED: Yeah , Laura ?
LAURA: Knock off the chatter , will ya ?

GUS: My fears ? Gus thinks about this .
PATRICK: Oblivion ? ANGLE ON Hazel , intrigued .

ISAAC MONICA: Always . Always . And Hazel hears
GUS: Literally .
HAZEL: Someone should probably tell him , do n't you think ? Jesus ? Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart . Gus laughs .
GUS: What 's your name ?
HAZEL: Hazel .
GUS: No your full name ?
CONFUSED: Hazel Grace Lancaster .
HAZEL: What ?
GUS: I did n't say anything .
HAZEL: Why are you looking at me like that ?

YOUNG GIRL: Hey Gus .

ISAAC MONICA: Always . Always .

HAZEL: Oh my god . Oh . My . God . You 're kidding right ? You just ruined the whole thing !
GUS: Whole thing ?
HAZEL: What , you think that 's cool ? Oh you idiot ! There 's always a hamartia , is n't there ? And yours is - even though you had FREAKING CANCER you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire EVEN MORE CANCER ! ? Ugh . And you were doing so well .
GUS: Hamartia ? Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him .
HAZEL: A fatal flaw .
GUS: They do n't hurt you unless you light them .
HAZEL: Sorry ?
GUS: I 've never lit one . Hazel turns back to him .
HAZEL: Metaphor .
FRANNIE: Hi sweetheart . Ready for some `` Model ? ''
HAZEL: Ca n't tonight . I 've made plans with Augustus Waters .
GUS: I failed the test a couple times .
HAZEL: You do n't say .
GUS: Most amputees can drive with no problem but yeah . Not me .
HAZEL: I 'm surprised you have a license .
GUS: Tell me about it !
HAZEL: Aha . Cancer perk .
GUS: Total cancer perk . A few beats of silence .
HAZEL: I was 13 when they found it .
FRANNIE: Are you ready , sweetie ?
HAZEL: Tumors shrank , my mets have hardly grown since
GUS: Wow .
HAZEL: Yeah .
GUS: So are you back in school or ?
HAZEL: Ca n't .
GUS: Why not ?
HAZEL: Got my GED .
GUS: A college girl ! Well that explains the aura of sophistication
GUS'S MOM: Augustus , hi . New friend ?
GUS: This is Hazel Grace .
HAZEL: It 's just Hazel .
GUS'S DAD: How 's it going , Just Hazel ?
ABRUPTLY: Downstairs if you need us !
HAZEL: Nice to meet you !
GUS: I used to play .
HAZEL: Must have been pretty good .
GUS: These are mine . And these . The rest of it 's just cancer perks .
HAZEL: Need to sit . Gus sits down next to her on the bed .
GUS: I understand .
HAZEL: I 'll be fine in a minute . Unless I faint . I 'm a bit of a Victorian lady , fainting-wise .
GUS: You ok ? Hazel nods , smiles .
HAZEL: I already told you my story . I was
GUS: Not your cancer story . Your story . Interests , hobbies , passions , weird fetishes
HAZEL: Um
GUS: Do n't tell me you 're one of those people who becomes their disease .
HAZEL: No . I 'm just I do n't know un- extraordinary .
GUS: I reject that out of hand . Think of something you love . First thing that comes to mind .
HAZEL: `` An Imperial Affliction . ''
GUS: Ok. What 's that ?
HAZEL: It 's a novel . My favorite novel .
GUS: Does it have zombies ?
LAUGHING: What ? No .
GUS: Stormtroopers .
HAZEL: Seriously ?
HE SHRUGS: It 's not that kind of book .
GUS: Sounds horrible .
HAZEL: It 's not , it 's kind of my bible actually .
GUS: Interesting . What 's it about ?
HAZEL: Cancer . But not in that way , trust me . The guy who wrote it , Peter Van Houten , he 's well , the only person I 've ever come across who seems to a ) understand what it 's like to be dying and b ) not have died .
HAZEL: Not so much cold as under- oxygenated .
GUS: Ooh Hazel Grace
BEAT: I love it when you talk medical to me .
FRANNIE: That 's different . Hazel shrugs . Frannie looks intrigued .
HAZEL: By `` it '' do you mean herpes ?
FRANNIE: I 'm sure he 'll call , do n't worry .
HAZEL: I 'm not worried . Please . It 's not like I 'm waiting for him to call o anything . I just we hung out . No ig deal .
MICHAEL: Would you like to be excused ?
HAZEL: Welcome to the sweet torture of eading `` An Imperial ``
TO ISAAC: Dude ! Hey ! Does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse ?
GUS: Isaac ! Focus . On . Me .
TO HAZEL: How fast can you get here ?
GUS: Isaac , Hazel from Support Group is coming downstairs .
HAZEL NODS: You look nice , by the way .
HAZEL: How ya doing Isaac ?
GUS: Seems Isaac and Monica are no longer a going concern .
HAZEL: Oh I 'm sorry .
BEAT: Do you want to talk about it ? Isaac starts to sob again .
GUS: He just wants to cry and play video games .
HAZEL: Fair enough .
GUS: It does n't hurt to talk to him , however . If you have any sage words of feminine advice
HAZEL: I actually think his response is appropriate .
GUS: `` Pain demands to be felt . ''
HAZEL: You 're quoting my book !
ISAAC: She did n't want to do it after the surgery . Said she could n't handle it . I 'm about to lose my eyesight and she ca n't handle it . Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy .
HAZEL: Sometimes people do n't understand the promises they 're making when they make them .
ISAAC: Right , sure , but you keep the promise anyway . That 's what love is . Love is keeping the promise anyway .
GUS: That could be an `` encouragement . ''
SHE SMILES: I ca n't stop thinking about it .
HAZEL: I know , right ?
GUS: The only problem is the ending .
HAZEL: It is rather abrupt .
GUS: It 's torture ! I mean , I totally get that she died or whatever - Anna . But there is an unwritten contract etween author and reader and I think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract .
HAZEL: But that 's part of what I like about it . It portrays death truthfully . You die in the middle of your life , in the middle of a sentence . But I do - God , I do want to know what happens to everyone else .
GUS: Yeah like her Mom .
HAZEL: The Dutch Tulip Man
GUS: Sysiphus the Hamster
HAZEL: I 've written letters . He 's neve esponded . Apparently he moved to Amsterdam , became a recluse . Has n't published anything . Does n't do interviews .
GUS: Sad .
BEAT: Hang on . Isaac !
GUS: Pillows do n't break .
FRANNIE: Dr. Maria called today . The PET Scan is set for the eighth .
MICHAEL: By all means .
GUS: Hazel Grace .
HAZEL: Hello Augustus .
GUS: So I read it again . And I just kept feeling like like it was a gift . Like you 'd given me something important .
TOUCHED: You 're welcome .
GUS: On the other hand we need closure , do n't we ?
HAZEL: What we need is a sequel .
GUS: Yes . We need to know what happens to Anna 's family after she dies .
HAZEL: That 's what I kept asking Van Houten for in my letters .
GUS: But he never wrote back .
HAZEL: That 's correct .
GUS: Because he 's a recluse .
HAZEL: Yeee-up .
GUS: Utterly unreachable .
HAZEL: Unfortunately so . Gus clears his throat , smiles . Hazel waits .
GUS: `` Dear Mr . Waters I am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence received this 6th of April . Hazel sits up . Could it be ?
HAZEL: Augustus ! ?
GUS: I found his assistant . I emailed her . She must have forwarded it to him . Shall I continue ?
HAZEL: Keep reading , keep reading !
GUS: `` I am particularly indebted to you , sir , both for your kind words about ` An Imperial Affliction ' and fo taking the time to tell me that the ook , and here I quote you directly , ` meant a great deal ' to you . '' Hazel pays attention to every word .
HAZEL: You 're making this up ?
GUS: Hazel Grace , could I , with my meager intellectual capabilities , make up a letter from the great Peter Van Houten ?
HAZEL: Holy hell .
GUS: Indeed .
HAZEL: Can I would you mind
SMILING: Go check your in-box .
HAZEL: `` I know these are not important literary questions and that you ook is full of important literary questions , but I would just really like to know . ''
GUS: Not bad .
HAZEL: You think ?
GUS: Bit pretentious . But then again , Van Houten uses words like `` tendentious '' and `` bacchanalia '' so I think he 'll like it . Hazel smiles , looks at a clock .
HAZEL: Is it really almost 1 ?
GUS: Guess so .
HAZEL: I got ta get to sleep .
GUS: Ok
HAZEL: Ok
GUS: Ok
HAZEL: Ok They both laugh at this .
GUS: Perhaps `` ok '' will be our `` always . '' Hazel smiles .
HAZEL: Ok .
GUS: Ok .
HAZEL: Ok .
ISAAC: She has n't even visited . Fourteen months we were together . What kind of person
ISAAC'S NURSE: You 'll get over her Isaac . Just takes a little time . You 'll see . The Nurse exits the room .
ISAAC: Is she gone ?
HAZEL: Yeah .
ISAAC: Did she really just say `` you 'll see ? ''
HAZEL: Qualities of a Good Nurse . Go .
ISAAC: Does n't pun your disability .
HAZEL: Gets blood on the first try .
ISAAC: That is huge . I mean , seriously , is this my freakin ' arm or a dartboard ? Three - no condescending voice .
HAZEL: `` I 'm gon na stab you with this needle now , so there might be a little ouchie . ''
ISAAC: I do n't know . To be honest , I think a hell of a lot more about Monica than my eye . Is that crazy ? That 's crazy .
HAZEL: It 's a little crazy .
ISAAC: But I believe in love , you know ? I do n't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever , but everybody should have true love . Do n't you think ?
HAZEL: Was he ?
ISAAC: Mmm that 's better .
HAZEL: The pain ? Good . Good , Isaac . What about Gus ?
READING ALOUD: `` Dear Ms. Lancaster I can not answer your questions , at least not in writing , because to do so would constitute a sequel , which you might publish or otherwise share on the internet . Not that I do n't trust you , but how could I trust you , I barely know you . ''
HAZEL: `` Should ever you find yourself in Amsterdam , do pay a visit at you leisure . Yours most sincerely , Peter Van Houten '' Son of a - WHAT
FRANNIE: What 's wrong ? !
HAZEL: Nothing . Sorry .
CONFUSED: Nothing ?
HAZEL: Everything ! Look !
FRANNIE: Hazel , I I love you and you know I 'd do anything for you , but we do n't
PAINED: We do n't have the money . The expense of getting equipment ove there - love , it 's just not possible
DEFLATES: No , yeah , of course .
FRANNIE: I mean , I could talk to your fathe
HAZEL: Mom , no . Please . Do n't do anything . Forget I mentioned it .
GUS: Just use your wish .
HAZEL: I 've used it already . Pre- `` Miracle . ''
GUS: What 'd you do ? Hazel does n't want to say . Gus realizes .
HAZEL: I was 13
GUS: Tell me you did not go to Disney World . Hazel Grace ! You did not use you one dying Wish to go to Disney World !
FEEBLE: And Epcot Center .
GUS: Oh my God !
DEFENDING HERSELF: We had fun on that trip .
GUS: That is the saddest thing I 've eve heard !
HAZEL: I met Goofy
GUS: Now I 'm embarrassed .
HAZEL: Why are you embarrassed ?
GUS: How can I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes ?
HAZEL: Wait , what ?
GUS: What ?
MICHAEL: Is that a Rik Smits jersey ?
GUS: It is indeed .
BEAT: Man , I loved that guy . Hazel sees Gus , was n't expecting him .
HAZEL: Gus ?
GUS: Hi Hazel .
BEAT: How would you like to go on a picnic ?
FRANNIE: Something to drink ?
GUS: I 'm great Mrs. Lancaster .
MICHAEL: You 're a survivor yourself ?
GUS: Did n't cut this fella off for the hell of it . Though it is an excellent weight-loss strategy . Legs are heavy !
MICHAEL: How 's your health now ?
GUS: N-E-C for fourteen months .
MICHAEL: That 's fantastic .
GUS: I 'm very lucky .
MICHAEL: Son , you have to understand Hazel 's still pretty sick . She will e the rest of her life .
HAZEL: You ready Gus ?
GUS: Every last one .
BEAT: Probably why I 'm still a virgin . Hazel laughs , elbows him .
HAZEL: You 're not a virgin . Are you really ?
GUS: See this ? This circle is virgins
EXPLAINING: `` Funky Bones '' by Joep Van Lieshout .
HAZEL: He sounds Dutch .
GUS: And he is . Much like Rik Smits . And tulips .
HAZEL: Let me guess
NODS: Dutch cheese . And tomato . The tomatoes are Mexican . Sorry .
GUS: How cool is that ? A skeleton being used as a playground .
HAZEL: You do love your symbols .
GUS: Speaking of which
HAZEL: It has crossed my mind .
GUS: Hazel Grace , like so many before you - and I say this with great affection - you spent your Wish moronically .
HAZEL: I was thir
GUS: Hush ! I 'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here .
HAZEL: Sorry . Please , continue
GUS: You were young . Impressionable . The Grim Reaper staring you in the face . And the fear of dying with your one true Wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you did n't really want , for how could little Hazel Grace , having neve ead `` An Imperial Affliction '' eve know that her one TRUE wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile . Hazel nods in agreement .
HAZEL: But I did n't save it . Gus smiles .
GUS: Good thing I saved mine .
BEAT: And I still have it . She starts to realize .
HAZEL: Are you saying
GUS: I 'm not gon na give you my Wish o anything . But I too have an interest in meeting Peter Van Houten and it would n't make much sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book , now would it ? I talked to the Genies and they 're in total agreement .
BEAT: We leave on May third .
HAZEL: Wait a minute .
BEAT: Are you only doing this so I 'll kiss you ? A beat . Gus blinks a few times .
HAZEL: Cause I 'd totally kiss you eithe way .
GUS: Because Hazel Grace I found my Wish . And Hazel is beyond touched . We hear
FRANNIE: It 's too much , Haze . We ca n't accept something like that from a virtual stranger .
HAZEL: He 's not a stranger .
FRANNIE: Really ?
HAZEL: Do n't be gross .
FRANNIE: It 's still `` no , '' I 'm afraid .
HAZEL: Can we at least ask Dr. Maria ?
DR. MARIA: That 's out of the question .
HAZEL: You said the PET scan was encouraging !
DR. MARIA: The PET scan is encouraging . We just do n't know how long it 'll stay that way . What if you get sick in a foreign country ?
HAZEL: They have doctors in Amsterdam . And cancer . Someone will know what to do .
DR. MARIA: Be that as it may , without someone familiar with your particular case , I ca n't
HAZEL: So you 'll come too .
FRANNIE: What ?
HAZEL: The Genies can hook it up . They 're loaded .
HAZEL: You 've never been to Amsterdam , have you Mom ?
HAZEL'S NURSE: Hello .
HAZEL: Hi .
HAZEL'S NURSE: You 're ok , Hazel . Even Hazel seems surprised by that .
FRANNIE: They thought it was a brain tumor .
MICHAEL: It was n't - thank god
HAZEL: So what happened ?
FRANNIE: The usual . Fluid in the lungs , preventing oxygenation . They put that in
MICHAEL: The good news is no tumo growth . No new tumors in your body . Hazel nods . That is a relief .
FRANNIE: This is just a thing Hazel . It 's a thing we can live with .
GUS: Mr. Lancaster ! How 's she doing ?
MICHAEL: Better , thank you . Much better . Gus nods , as relieved as the rest of them .
GUS: They wo n't let me in . Family only .
MICHAEL: I 'm sorry
GUS: No I get it . Will you just will you tell her I was here ?
MICHAEL: Of course I will .
ONCOLOGIST #1: The great news is Phalanxifo continues to control your tumo growth .
BEAT: The not so great news is we 're still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation .
HAZEL: Um , I feel like I 'm not the most qualified person to answer that .
ONCOLOGIST #1: I was talking to Dr. Simmons .
DR. SIMMONS: It 's a strange case . Normally the tumors start resisting the treatment . But that has n't happened here - yet . Hazel hears the `` yet '' the loudest .
DR. MARIA: But if we stopped it entirely , we 're likely to face even grave dangers .
MICHAEL: So we 're gon na do nothing ?
DR. MARIA: That 's what we have to decide . The truth is very few people have een on Phalanxifor as long as Hazel has . We do n't really know the long term effects . That comforts no one .
HAZEL: Ca n't I just get like a lung transplant or something ?
DR. MARIA: You would not be considered a strong candidate for a transplant .
DR. SIMMONS: We 're trying to prevent endothelial growth while at the same time preventing immunosorbent
FRANNIE: Are you ready , sweetie ?
HAZEL: I have a question .
DR. MARIA: Yes Hazel .
HAZEL: Can I still go to Amsterdam ?
DR. SIMMONS: That would not be wise at this juncture .
HAZEL: Why not ?
DR. SIMMONS: Excuse me ?
HAZEL: Why not , Dr. Simmons ?
DR. MARIA: It would increase some risks
HAZEL: So does going to the mall
DR. MARIA: Yes but an airplane ?
HAZEL: They have oxygen on airplanes .
DR. SIMMONS: You 're Stage IV
HAZEL: I have this opportunity I may neve have again . If the medicine 's working , I do n't see why
DR. SIMMONS: Because , Hazel .
BEAT: Look , I do n't know any other way to say this You 're just too sick . And this is like a punch in the gut .
DR. SIMMONS: I 'm sorry .
FRANNIE: We 'll be right outside .
MICHAEL: Gus again .
HAZEL: Hi Augustus .
GUS: I see your point .
BEAT: That is one sad swing set . Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder .
HAZEL: Thanks for coming over .
GUS: You do realize trying to keep your distance from me will in no way lessen my affection for you . Hazel says nothing .
HAZEL: It 's not about Amsterdam . It 's about me . It 's about
GUS: Grenades . Hazel nods .
HAZEL: Exactly .
GUS: There 's already two people in you life you 're going to destroy . Why add a third to that list . Am I ight ?
NODS: That 's why I do n't have a hamster .
GUS: We have got to do something about this frigging swing set .
TYPING: `` Swing Set Needs Home . ''
GUS: `` Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home . ''
HAZEL: `` Lonely , Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks Butts of Children . '' Gus laughs .
GUS: That 's why . Hazel looks at him , not understanding .
ISAAC: Do you like him ?
HAZEL: Of course I like him .
ISAAC: But you do n't want to hook up with him ? Hazel does n't know what she wants .
HAZEL: It 's complicated .
FRANNIE: What is it , what 's wrong ? !
HAZEL: Sorry , I I did n't know you were in the shower .
EXHAUSTED: Bath . I was just just trying to take a bath for five seconds . What 's the matter ?
HAZEL: Did you ever call the Genies to tell them the trip is off ? I just got an email from Peter Van Houton 's assistant . She still thinks we 're coming .
FRANNIE: I 'm not supposed to tell you until your father gets home .
BEAT: We 're going to Amsterdam .
HAZEL: Really
FRANNIE: Dr. Maria called last night and made a convincing case that you need to live
FRANNIE: I 'm getting back in the tub now .
HAZEL: One week , lungs . Keep your shit together one more week
FRANNIE: Amsterdam ! And a moment later Michael joins them .
MICHAEL: Amsterdam !
WHISPERING: I love you . I 'm so proud of you .
HAZEL: For what ?
FRANNIE: We ca n't eavesdrop , Hazel .
TO FRANNIE: Always a pleasure to see you ma'am .
BEAT: Hello , Hazel Grace .
HAZEL: Ok ?
GUS: Ok .
HAZEL: Ok .
FRANNIE: Amsterdam !
HAZEL: Amsterdam !
LITTLE GIRL: What 's in your nose ?
HAZEL: It 's called a Cannula . These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe .
GIRL'S MOTHER: Jackie Oh , I 'm sorry .
SINCERE: No , no . It 's alright .
LITTLE GIRL: Would they help me breathe too ?
HAZEL: I dunno . Wan na try ?
LITTLE GIRL: Tickles .
HAZEL: Right ?
LITTLE GIRL: I think I 'm breathing better .
HAZEL: Well I 'd love to give you my cannula but I kinda really need the help .
LITTLE GIRL: Thanks for letting me try it .
HAZEL: I think that 's us .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Sir , you ca n't smoke on this plane . Or any plane .
GUS: I do n't smoke . The Flight Attendant shoots him a look .
HAZEL: It 's a metaphor . He puts the killing thing in his mouth but does n't give it the power to kill him .
NO NONSENSE: That metaphor is prohibited on today 's flight . Gus nods and puts the cigarette away .
PA SYSTEM: `` Flight attendants , prepare fo departure . ''
HAZEL: Ok ? Gus does n't say it back . Hazel laughs .
GUS: We 're flying ! Look ! Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm .
FRANNIE: ( not looking up from he
MAGAZINE: Just so you know , I 'm right here . Sitting next to you . Your mother .
HAZEL: We 're just friends , Mom .
GUS: She is . I 'm not .
CAB DRIVER: Americans ?
FRANNIE: We 're from Indiana .
CAB DRIVER: Indiana . They steal from the Indians but the keep the name , yes ? Hazel and Gus share a look .
HAZEL: Something like that .
CAB DRIVER: Yes and no . Amsterdam is like the ings of a tree . It gets older as you get closer to the center .
GUS: I 'll be right down the hall .
HAZEL: Good morning .
FRANNIE: Actually , it 's five o'clock .
HAZEL: How was the park ?
FRANNIE: Never made it .
HAZEL: Mom !
FRANNIE: What ? I like watching you sleep .
HAZEL: What do you mean ?
FRANNIE: You have reservations at a place called Oranjee . Mr. Van Houten set it up . Very fancy according to the Book . And romantic .
HAZEL: Mom
FRANNIE: I 'm just saying
HAZEL: A 16 year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery is totally cool with you . Is that what you 're saying ?
FRANNIE: Let 's get you dressed ! Hazel just shakes her head . CUT TO
TO GUS: Looking sharp .
GUS: Thank you ma'am .
BEAT: Am I under-dressed ?
GUS: You look gorgeous .
HOSTESS: Your table , Mr. And Mrs . Waters .
GUS: Ok. Hazel raises hers .
HAZEL: Ok . They clink glasses and sip .
WAITER: Do you know what Dom Perignon said after he invented champagne ?
BEAT: ` Come quickly , ' he said . ` I am tasting the stars ! ' Hazel and Gus smile .
WAITER: Welcome to Oranjee . Would you like a menu or will you have the chef 's choice ? Gus looks at Hazel . She shrugs .
GUS: The chef 's choice sounds lovely . And can we get more of this ?
WAITER: We have bottled all the stars fo you this evening , my young friends .
GUS: Thank you for coming to Amsterdam .
HAZEL: Thank you for letting me hijack your wish .
GUS: Thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa .
WAITER: Belgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion . Hazel takes a bite .
HAZEL: Oh my god .
GUS: Yeah ? Gus takes a bite .
HAZEL: I mean
GUS: That is just
HAZEL: There are no words .
SHOUTING BACK: We do n't speak Dutch !
ANOTHER LOCAL: She says , `` the beautiful couple is eautiful ! ''
GUS: I want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person so I can take it to Vegas and marry it .
HAZEL: I like your suit .
GUS: Thanks . First time wearing it .
HAZEL: That is n't the suit you wear to funerals ?
GUS: Oh no . That one 's not nearly this nice . When I first found out I was sick - I mean , they told me I had like an 85 % chance to be cancer-free . Great odds , sure . But that meant a yea of torture , the loss of my leg , and still a 15 % chance it might fail .
BEAT: So right before the surgery I asked my parents if I could buy a suit , like a really nice suit , just in case I did n't make it .
HAZEL: It 's your death suit .
GUS: That 's what it is .
HAZEL: I have one of those . Bought it fo my 15th birthday . Do n't think I 'd wear it on a date , though .
GUS: Are we on a date ?
HAZEL: Watch it . Gus winks . CUT TO
GUS: God ?
HAZEL: Maybe .
GUS: Angels ?
HAZEL: Undecided .
GUS: Afterlife ?
HAZEL: No . Well
BEAT: Maybe I would n't go so far as to say no . I just I 'd like some evidence .
GUS NODS: What do you think ?
GUS: Absolutely .
HAZEL: Really ?
GUS: Oh for sure . I mean , not like a heaven where you ride unicorns , play harps , and live in a mansion made of clouds but , yeah , I believe in something . Hazel is surprised .
HAZEL: Maybe there is no point .
GUS: I refuse to accept that .
BEAT: I wo n't accept it .
HAZEL: I hope you 're right .
GUS: I 'm in love with you .
GUS: I 'm in love with you . And I know that love is just a shout into the void , and that oblivion is inevitable , and that we 're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been eturned to dust , and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we 'll ever have , and I am in love with you . Sorry . At which point , the Waiter reappears .
WAITER: More stars ?
GUS: Just the check , please .
WAITER: No , sir .
BEAT: Your meal has been paid for by Mr. Van Houten .
FRANNIE: I really do n't get that shirt .
HAZEL: Van Houten will get it . Trust me . There are like fifty Magritte eferences in `` Imperial Affliction . ''
READING: `` This is not a pipe . ''
HAZEL: Exactly .
FRANNIE: But it is a pipe .
HAZEL: No it 's not . It 's a drawing of a pipe . See ?
SHE DOESN'T: All representations of a thing are inherently abstract . A drawing of a thing is not the thing itself . No is a t-shirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself .
FRANNIE: When did you get so grown up ? I feel like it was yesterday I was telling 8-year old Hazel why the sky was blue . You thought I was a genius back then .
HAZEL: Why is the sky blue ?
BEAT: Because I say so . A knock on the door . Gus pokes his head in .
GUS: Who 's ready for some answers !
HAZEL: I 'm so excited I can barely eathe .
GUS: As opposed to other days ?
BEAT: Who the hell 's `` they ? ''
VAN HOUTEN: Which of you is Augustus Waters ? Gus raises his hand tentatively .
LIDEWIJ: Please . I am sorry . Come in .
HAZEL: Trash ?
LIDEWIJ: Fan mail . 18 years worth . He neve opens it .
VAN HOUTEN: Yours are the first missives to which I 've replied and look where that got me . Hazel and Gus take their seats .
HAZEL: Um , no thanks .
VAN HOUTEN: Augustus Waters ?
GUS: It 's 11am .
VAN HOUTEN: Just me then , Lidewij . Scotch and soda .
LIDEWIJ: Perhaps some breakfast first Peter ?
VAN HOUTEN: She thinks I have a drinking problem .
LIDEWIJ: I also think the Earth is round .
VAN HOUTEN: So you like my book .
HAZEL: Yes . We - well , Augustus , he made meeting you his Wish so that we could come here and talk to you .
VAN HOUTEN: Did you dress like her on purpose ?
HAZEL: Kinda .
VAN HOUTEN: I do not have a drinking problem . I have a Churchillian relationship with alcohol I can crack jokes and govern England and do anything I want to do . Except not drink .
GUS: Incidentally , thank you for dinne last night .
TO LIDEWIJ: We bought them dinner last night ?
LIDEWIJ: It was our pleasure .
SIGHS: You 've come a long way so what is it I can do for you ?
HAZEL: We have some questions
VAN HOUTEN: Uh-huh
HAZEL: About what happens , you know after the end of your book . Specifically to those who Anna leaves behind . Like her Mom , the Dutch Tulip Man , Sisy
HAZEL: I would say limited ?
VAN HOUTEN: But presumably you know Afasi Och Filthy 's seminal album `` Flacken . ''
GUS: Um
VAN HOUTEN: Lidewij ! Play ` Bomfalleralla ' immediately .
HAZEL: I 'm sorry , sir . We do n't speak Swedish .
YELLING: Who the hell speaks Swedish ? The important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying , but what the voices are feeling .
GUS: Are you messing with us ?
VAN HOUTEN: Pardon ?
GUS: Is this some kind of performance ?
VAN HOUTEN: Rudolf Otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you . And I say to you , my friends , if you can not hear Afasi Och Filthy 's bravadic esponse to fearfulness , then my work is not for you .
HAZEL: So anyway when the book ends , Anna 's mom
VAN HOUTEN: ( raising a hand to silence
HER: Let us imagine that you are racing a tortoise .
VAN HOUTEN: The tortoise has a ten yard head start . In the time it takes you to un ten yards , the tortoise has moved maybe one yard . And so on , forever .
VAN HOUTEN: I assume that answers you questions .
TO HAZEL: I do n't know what 's going on .
VAN HOUTEN: And yet you seemed so intelligent in print , Mr . Waters . Must be all that cancer in you ain .
LIDEWIJ: Peter !
HAZEL: Can we please , maybe , talk about Anna for a sec ? I mean , I understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she ecomes too sick to continue
VAN HOUTEN: I 'm not interested in talking about that book .
HAZEL: - but that does n't mean her family and everyone she loves does n't have a future , right ?
VAN HOUTEN: I said I 'm not interested
GETTING UPSET: But you promised !
VAN HOUTEN: Nothing happens to them ! They 're fictions . They cease to exist the moment the novel is over .
HAZEL: They ca n't ! ( again , has to calm
HERSELF: I mean , I understand . In a literary sense . But it 's impossible NOT to imagine some future
VAN HOUTEN: I ca n't do this . Lidewij , get rid of them , please . I wo n't indulge your childish whims . I refuse to pity you in the manner in which you 're accustomed .
HAZEL: I do n't want your pity
VAN HOUTEN: Of course you do . Like all sick kids , your existence depends on it .
LIDEWIJ: Peter !
VAN HOUTEN: You are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed , the child who believes there is life after a novel ends . And we , as adults , we pity this , so we pay for your treatments , fo your oxygen machines . We give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough
VAN HOUTEN: You are a side effect of an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives .
HAZEL: Hey listen douchepants . You 're not gon na tell me anything I do n't already know about illness . I need one thing and one thing only from you before I walk out of your life and that 's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters !
BEAT: I can not tell you .
HAZEL: Bullshit !
VAN HOUTEN: I can not Van Houten goes to take a drink but
HAZEL: Make something up .
VAN HOUTEN: Lidewij . I 'll have a martini please .
LIDEWIJ: I have resigned .
VAN HOUTEN: Oh do n't be ridiculous .
HAZEL: You 're really not gon na tell us ?
VAN HOUTEN: I would like you to leave .
HAZEL: Go fuck yourself .
GUS: Hey . It 's ok . It 's ok I 'll write you a sequel . I will . Better than any shit that drunk could write . With blood and guts and sacrifice . You 'll love it .
HAZEL: I spent your Wish on that asshole .
GUS: You did not spend it on him . You spent it on us . They embrace once more .
HAZEL: I wanted
GUS: I know I know . Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory .
LIDEWIJ: I 'm so sorry . Circumstance has made him cruel . I thought meeting you would help him , if he would see that his work has shaped real lives , but I 'm very sorry .
GUS: I 'm not going anywhere with that monster .
LIDEWIJ: He is not invited .
HAZEL: Oh , um , that 's alright .
LIDEWIJ: No , there are many stairs . Steep stairs .
HAZEL: I can do it .
LIDEWIJ: Shall we ?
GUS: You 're a champion .
RESOLUTE: I 'm ok .
GUS: We 're at the top . That 's it .
LIDEWIJ: The only member of the whole family to survive was Otto , Anne 's father . Gus takes Hazel 's hand .
GUS: It 's above my knee .
HAZEL: What ?
GUS: My leg .
BEAT: Just so you 're prepared
HAZEL: Oh get over yourself .
GUS: I love you too , Hazel Grace . They resume kissing . And we CUT TO
HAZEL: `` Get up you fat bastard . ''
GUS: `` I ca n't stand up , I 'm too drunk . ''
HAZEL: I said `` get up . ''
GUS: `` Standing is for fools ! ''
HAZEL: God , what an asshole . They both giggle at the whole thing .
FRANNIE: And then what happened ?
HAZEL: Then we went to the Anne Frank museum .
FRANNIE: And after that ? A quick glance between Hazel and Gus .
HAZEL: We just walked around .
FRANNIE: Sounds lovely . A few beats later .
THAT'S WEIRD: Um ok
HAZEL: That was weird . Gus does n't respond except to say
GUS: Shall we ?
HAZEL: Augustus ?
GUS: There 's something I have to tell you They walk in silence a few beats .
HAZEL: Oh no
GUS: I had a PET scan .
HAZEL: Oh god .
GUS: The lining of my chest , my liver everywhere .
HAZEL: Oh my god no !
GUS: I 'm sorry too
HAZEL: It 's so unfair
GUS: I should have told you
HAZEL: It 's so fucking unfair ! A beat . Gus still trying not to cry .
GUS: Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory .
HAZEL: Does it hurt ?
GUS: It 's ok .
BEAT: I 'm ok .
HAZEL: Ok .
GUS: Ok . But of course it 's not ok. Not by a mile .
HAZEL: I 'm just I 'm very fond of you . He grabs her hand and holds it .
GUS: I do n't suppose you can forget about it , treat me like I 'm not dying .
HAZEL: I do n't think you 're dying , Augustus . You 've just got a touch of cancer . Gus nods . Squeezes her hand .
GUS: Would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now ?
HAZEL: Gus had a recurrence .
NODS: Mrs . Waters told us the night efore you left .
BEAT: I 'm sorry Hazel .
HAZEL: You 're not gon na say it ?
MICHAEL: What 's that ?
HAZEL: The usual . `` Everything happens fo a reason '' Michael shakes his head .
MICHAEL: I do n't know , Haze .
BEAT: I always thought being an adult meant knowing what you believe
HAZEL: How are your eyes ?
ISAAC: Great . Wonderful . I mean , they 're not in my head is the only problem .
GUS: I hate to one-up you but seems my entire body is made out of cancer now , so
ISAAC: Did you write his eulogy yet ? Hazel is confused .
GUS: Dude .
ISAAC: What ?
GUS: I have n't asked her .
ISAAC: Oh .
BEAT: Oops .
HAZEL: What are you talking about ?
ISAAC: My bad .
STILL CONFUSED: Augustus ? Gus looks at her , grows a little serious .
GUS: I need speakers at my funeral . I thought maybe you and Isaac but especially you
ISAAC: Hey !
GUS: Would you be kind enough to whip something up ?
HAZEL: It would be an honor . They hold holds .
ISAAC: You guys are adorable . Hazel play slaps Isaac on the arm .
HAZEL: How 's your love life ? Anything from Monica ?
ISAAC: Not a word .
HAZEL: She has n't even like , texted to ask how you 're doing ?
ISAAC: I 've stopped thinking about it . Moving on . There 's a new girl in Support Group with these humongous -
HAZEL: How do you even know that ?
ISAAC: I 'm blind but I 'm not that blind .
GUS: Hazel Grace ! They turn to him .
HAZEL: Ok now what ? Gus smiles . CUT TO

GUS: Oh it 's there .
ISAAC: She 's in the house ?
GUS: Who cares where she is ? This is not about her . This is about you . Hazel
ISAAC: I did n't hear anything .
GUS: A little to the left .
ISAAC: My throw was to the left or I should aim to the left ?
GUS: Aim left . Isaac turns his shoulders .
ISAAC: Really ?
GUS: No you missed it by like 20 feet . Try one more time .
HAZEL: Woo hoo !
GUS: Keep throwing , keep throwing !
MONICA'S MOM: What in God 's name
GUS: Are you Monica 's mom ?
CONFUSED: I am .
GUS: Hello ma'am . Your daughter has done an injustice and we 've come here seeking revenge . We may not look like much . Between the three of us , we have five legs , four eyes , and two and a half working lungs .
HAZEL: How 's he doing ?
MRS. WATERS: He 's had a tough night , Hazel . His lood pressure 's low . His heart Mrs . Waters starts to cry .

MRS. WATERS: They 're gon na stop the chemo .
HAZEL: Can I see him ?

GUS: Read it to me .
HAZEL: `` The Red Wheelbarrow '' by William Carlos Williams . `` So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain water / beside the white chickens . ''
BEAT: Is that it ?
HAZEL: No of course not . Um what else
THINKS: so much depends/ upon a blue sky cut open by the branches/ of the trees./ So much depends/ on the transparent G-tube/ erupting from the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy .
HAZEL: So much depends upon this observer of the universe As Gus is drifting off to sleep , WE HEAR

GUS: Would you believe they leave the door open at night ?
HAZEL: Um , no .
GUS: As well you should n't .
ISAAC: `` Augustus Waters was a self- aggrandizing bastard . But we forgive him . We forgive him not ecause he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked , or because he got 18 years when he should have gotten more . ''
ISAAC: I 'm assuming you 've got some time , you interrupting bastard ! I mean seriously `` Augustus Waters talked so much that he 'd interrupt you at his own funeral . And he was pretentious .
ISAAC: `` But I will say this when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on , I will tell the scientists to piss off , because I do n't even want to see a world without Augustus Waters . ''
GUS: Thank you Isaac .
ISAAC: Goddamn it , Gus .
GUS: Hey do n't swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus .
ISAAC: Shit ! Ass ! Balls !
GUS: Hazel Grace , it 's down to you .
HAZEL: `` Augustus Waters was the great star- crossed love of my life . Ours was an epic love story , and I wo n't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears .
BEAT: Like all real love stories - ours will die with us , as it should . I 'd hoped that he 'd be eulogizing me , ecause there 's no one I 'd rathe have ''
HAZEL: `` I ca n't talk about our love story so instead I will talk about math . I am not a mathematician , but I know this there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1 . There 's .1 And .12 And .112 And an infinite collection of others . Of course , there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2 , or between 0 and a million . Some infinities are bigger than other infinities . A writer we used to like taught us that . I want more numbers than I 'm likely to get , and God , I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got . But , Gus , my love , I can not tell you how thankful I am for ou little infinity . You gave me a forever within the numbered days , and for that I am eternally grateful . I love you . ''
MRS. WATERS: He loved you so much . Hazel nods . Hugs them back .
HAZEL: He loved you so much too .
MINISTER: I think we 're ready to begin .
MALE VOICE: What a load of shit , eh kid ?
MINISTER: Let us pray .
VAN HOUTEN: We need to fake pray now .
MINISTER: Now I call on Augustus 's close friend Isaac to say a few words .
ISAAC: Of all the things I 've lost in my life , this hurts the most .
MINISTER: And now we 'll hear from Gus 's special friend Hazel Lancaster .
HAZEL: I was his girlfriend .
FRANNIE: Are you sure ? We can drive you
HAZEL: No , I 'd I 'd like to be alone fo a while .

VAN HOUTEN: I would hardly call him a fan . He despised me . But he was quite insistent I attend his funeral and tell you what became of Anna and her mother . So here I am and that 's your answer omnis cellula e cellula .
HAZEL: I 'm so not in the mood
VAN HOUTEN: `` Life comes from life . ''

HAZEL: She had leukemia ? Like Anna ?
VAN HOUTEN: Just like her , yes .
HAZEL: Were you married then ?
VAN HOUTEN: Not when she died , no . I was insufferable long before Anna , my dear . Grief does n't change you , Hazel , it reveals you . Hazel takes that in .
HAZEL: Well I 'm sorry for your loss .
VAN HOUTEN: And I 'm sorry for yours . I 'm sorry for everything , for being so rude to you two , for ruining your trip
HAZEL: You did n't ruin our trip , you asshole . We had an awesome trip .
VAN HOUTEN: Hazel , I 'm trying . I 'm trying ! You asked me to tell you what happens and I wish I could do that . I wish that I could . But I ca n't . No one can . No one knows , Hazel . They do n't talk to us . Unless

MICHAEL: Gives you an idea how we feel about you .
ISAAC: Do you know if it hurt or whatever ?

ISAAC: It was annoying .
HAZEL: I did n't find it that annoying . They sit there in silence a few beats .
ISAAC: Did you read the note or whateve from your author friend ?
HAZEL: He is not my friend and how do you know about that ?
ISAAC: We talked at the cemetery . Said he came all this way to give you that .
HAZEL: Yeah well I 'm over it . I never want to read another word of that asshole 's again .
ISAAC: Yeah but he did n't write it - Gus did .

ISAAC: What ?
HAZEL: I I have to go . I Are you ?
ISAAC: I do it all the time . Go .

I do n't want to ask you any favors but if you have the time , and from what I saw you have plenty , please fix this for me . It 's a eulogy for Hazel . Hazel is overcome with emotion .
GUS'S VOICE: I like my choices . I hope she likes hers . Hazel CLOSES HER EYES .
HAZEL: Ok .
GONZO: What are you yelling about ?
DUKE: Never mind . It 's your turn to drive .
RADIO NEWS: An overdose of heroin was listed as the official cause of death fo pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby whose body was found stuffed in a efrigerator last week
GONZO: `` One toke over the line , sweet Jesus . ''
DUKE: One toke . You poor fool . Wait till you see those goddamn bats .
GONZO: Let 's give that boy a lift .
DUKE: We ca n't stop here - this is bat country !
HITCHHIKER: Hot damn ! I never rode in a convertible before !
DUKE: Is that right ? Well , I guess you 're about ready , eh ? The HITCHHIKER hesitates .
GONZO: We 're your friends . We 're not like the others .
DUKE: No more of that talk or I 'll put the leeches on you .
GONZO: It 's okay . He 's admiring the shape of your skull .
GONZO: Keep your hands off my fucking neck !
DUKE: I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney ! He 's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip . He 's a foreigner . I think he 's probably Samoan . But it does n't matter , does it ? Are you prejudiced ?
HITCHHIKER: Hell , no !
DUKE: I did n't think so . Because in spite of his race , this man is extremely valuable to me . Hell , I forgot all about this beer . You want one ? How about some ether ?
HITCHHIKER: What ?
DUKE: Never mind . Let 's get right to the heart of this thing . Twenty-fou hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel
DWARF: Perhaps this is the call you 've een waiting for all this time , sir DUKE lifts the receiver listens
DUKE: Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
DWARF: That was headquarters . They want me to go to Las Vegas at once and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named Lacerda . He 'll have the details . All I have to do is check into my sound proof suite and he 'll seek me out .
GONZO: God hell ! I think I see the pattern ! This one sounds like real trouble ! You 're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over . As your attorney I must advise you that you 'll need a very fast car with no top and afte that , the cocaine . And then the tape recorder , for special music , and some Acapulco shirts This blows my weekend , because naturally I 'll have to go with you and we 'll have to arm ourselves .
DUKE: Why not ? If a thing 's worth doing , it 's worth doing right .
GONZO: Indeed . We must do it . What kind of story is this ?
DUKE: The Mint 400 ! The richest off-road ace for motorcycles and dune- uggies in the history of organized sport ! a fantastic spectacle in hono of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Vegas at least that 's what the press release says .
GONZO: O.K. , O.K. , yes . Hang onto it . We 'll be there in thirty minutes . I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the prope coloring . What ? ! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card ! Do you ealize who the fuck you 're talking to ?
DUKE: Do n't take any guff from these swine . Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment . Nothing dinky . One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike , for picking up conversations in oncoming cars .
GONZO: We wo n't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit .
DUKE: We will . You Samoans are all the same . You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man 's culture .
AGENT: Say uh you fellas are going to be careful with this car , are n't you ?
DUKE: Of course .
AGENT: Well , good god ! You just backed over that two foot concrete abutment and you did n't even slow down ! Forty-five in reverse ! And you arely missed the pump !
DUKE: No harm done . I always test the transmission that way . The rea end . For stress factors .
AGENT: Say . Are you fellows drinking ?
DUKE: Not me . We 're responsible people .
GONZO: There 's another worrier . He 's probably all cranked up on speed .
DUKE: and we 're chock full of that !
GONZO: Damn right !
DUKE: My attorney understands this concept , despite his racial handicap . But do you ? ! The HITCHHIKER nods giggles petrified .
GONZO: My heart !
DUKE: The medicine ? Yes , it 's right here . DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin .
GONZO: Turn up the fucking music ! My heart feels like an alligator ! Volume ! Clarity ! Bass ! We must have bass ! What 's wrong with us ? Are you goddamn old ladies ?
DUKE: You scurvy shyster bastard ! Watch your language ! You 're talking to a Doctor of Journalism !
GONZO: What the fuck are we doing out here ? Somebody call the police ! We need help !
DUKE: Pay no attention to this swine . He ca n't handle the medicine .
GONZO: The truth is we 're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry . I 've known him for years ut he ripped us off and you know what that means , right ?
DUKE: And eat them ! That bastard wo n't get away with this ! What 's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism ? GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL .
HITCHHIKER: Thanks for the ride . Thanks a lot . I like you guys . Do n't worry about me .
DUKE: Wait a minute ! Come back and have a beer ! The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car .
GONZO: Good riddance . That boy made me nervous . Did you see his eyes ? Jesus , this is good medicine . DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER .
DUKE: Move over ! ! We have to get out of California before that kid finds a cop !
GONZO: Oh , Jesus ! Did you see what god just did to us ?
DUKE: God did n't do that ! You did it ! You 're a fucking narcotics agent , that was our cocaine , you pig !
GONZO: You better be careful . Plenty of vultures out here . They 'll pick your bones clean before morning .
DUKE: You whore ! GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID .
GONZO: Here chew this . It 's your half of the acid . DUKE takes his half chews it .
DUKE: How long do I have ?
GONZO: Maybe thirty more minutes . As you attorney , I advise you to drive at top speed . It 'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal . Are you ready for that ? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid .
DUKE: I need this , right ?
ATTENDANT: I 'll remember your face . DUKE stares losing it
RESERVATIONS CLERK: Your suite 's not ready yet . But there 's somebody looking for you .
GONZO: I can handle this . This man has a ad heart , but I have plenty of medicine . My name is Dr. Gonzo . Prepare our suite at once . We 'll e in the bar .
DUKE: Lacerda ?
GONZO: If you think we 're in trouble now wait until you see what 's happening in the elevators .
DUKE: But what about our room ? And the golf shoes ?
GONZO: That 's the press table . Where you have to sign in for our credentials . Shit , let 's get it over with . You handle that , and I 'll check on the oom .
DUKE: No , no . Do n't leave me ! Black screen .
BELL BOY: Four club sandwiches , four shrimp cocktails .

GONZO: Shoot it .
DUKE: Not yet . I want to study its habits .
BELL BOY: and nine fresh grapefruit .
GONZO: Vitamin C. We 'll need all we can get .
DUKE: What are you talking about ?
GONZO: You bastard ! They 'll never let us ack in that place . I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around yelling about eptiles ! You scared the shit out of those people ! They were ready to call the cops . Hell , the only eason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there
DUKE: Oh my God ! Who 's that ? !
LACERDA: Duke ? I 'm Lacerda your photographer . Got your press passes ? Good , good . Too bad you missed the bikes checking in . My , what a sight ! DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS .
DUKE: That 's good
GONZO: I think he 's lying to us . I could see it in his eyes .
DUKE: They 'll probably have a big net fo us when we show up .
GONZO: Turn that shit off ! GONZO kills the TV . Black screen .
DUKE: See '' Kill the body and the head will die '' the Frazier/Ali fight
MAGAZINE REPORTER: A proper end to the 60 's Ali eaten by a human hamburger !
DUKE: And both Kennedy 's murdered by mutants .

DUKE: Beats me . We 're just good patriotic Americans like yourself .
LACERDA: No , no we have to go on . We need total coverage . DUKE gets out of the Bronco .
DUKE: You 're fired .
GONZO: How about `` Nickel Nick 's Slot Arcade ? '' `` Hot Slots , '' that sounds heavy . Twenty-nine cent hotdogs
DUKE: Look , what are we doing here ? Are we here to entertain ourselves , o to do the job ?
GONZO: To do the job , of course . Here we go a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars ! The Shark hits a bump .
DUKE: Why ?
GONZO: Why what ?
DUKE: Why should I pay out my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse . I do n't know about you , but in my line of business it 's important to e Hep .
DOORMAN #1: What the hell are you doing ? !
DOORMAN #2: You ca n't park here !

GONZO: We want this car parked ! We drove all the way from L.A. for this show . We 're friends of Debbie 's .
DUKE: Holy shit ! They almost had us there ! That was quick thinking .
GONZO: What do you expect ? I 'm you attorney . You owe me five bucks . I want it now . DUKE shrugs and hands over the $ 5 .
DUKE: Did the mescaline just kick in ? O was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig ? !
GONZO: We wandered into a fucking time capsule !
DUKE: We wandered into a fucking time capsule !
GONZO: What 's this ? GONZO is instantly MOROSE .
DUKE: This is the place . They 'll neve fuck with us here .
GONZO: Where 's the ether ? This mescaline is n't working .
DUKE: Dogs fucked the Pope , no fault of mine . Watch out ! Why money ? My name is Brinks ; I was born Born ?
GONZO: Get sheep over side women and children to armored car orders from Captain Zeep .
FAIRGROUND BARKER: Stand in front of this fantastic machine , my friend . For just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown Las Vegas .
ANOTHER BARKER: Step right up ! Shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten-foot ull-dyke and win a cotton candy goat !
GONZO: I hate to say this , but this place is getting to me . I think I 'm getting The Fear .
DUKE: Nonsense . We came here to find the American Dream , and now we 're right in the vortex you want to quit . You must realize that we 've found the Main Nerve .
GONZO: That 's what gives me The Fear .
DUKE: Look over there . Two women fucking a Polar Bear .
GONZO: Please , do n't tell me those things Not now . This is my last drink . How much money can you lend me ?

GONZO: Do they pay you to screw that bear ?
WAITRESS: What ?
DUKE: He 's just kidding . Come on , Doc lets go downstairs and gamble .
GONZO: When does this thing stop ?
DUKE: It wo n't stop . It 's not ever going to stop . DUKE carefully steps off the turntable .
GONZO: Did you see that ? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back .
DUKE: Probably the bartender . He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress .
GONZO: Good God ! Let 's get out of here ! Where 's the elevator ?
DUKE: Do n't go near that elevator . That 's just what they want us to do trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement .
GONZO: You drive ! I think there 's something wrong with me .
DUKE: That 's Lacerda 's room . GONZO smiles a slow smile
GONZO: Yeah I thought we might need it
DUKE: What for ? GONZO snatches the key back .
GONZO: Let 's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose .
DUKE: No , we should leave the poo astard alone . I get the feeling that he 's avoiding us for some eason .
GONZO: Do n't kid yourself . That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous . He 's watching us like a hawk .
DUKE: He told me he was turning in early
GONZO: That dirty bastard ! I knew it ! He 's got hold of my woman !
DUKE: That little blonde groupie with the film crew ? You think he sodomized her ?
GONZO: That 's right , laugh about it ! You goddamn honkies are all the same !
DUKE: Where 'd you get that knife ?
GONZO: Room service sent it up . I wanted something to cut the limes .
DUKE: What limes ?
GONZO: They did n't have any . They do n't grow in the desert .
DUKE: The Vincent Black Shadow . We 're with the Factory Team .
TV CAMERAMAN: Bullshit .
GONZO: Wait a minute , pardon me lady , but I think there 's some kind of ignorant chicken-sucker in this ca who needs his face cut open . You cheap honky faggots ! Which one of you wants to get cut ? !
DUKE: Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight . I have to put the car in the lot .
MAGAZINE REPORTER: Las Vegas at dawn . The racers are still asleep , the dust is still on the desert , fifty thousand dollars in prize money , slumbers darkly in the office safe at Del Webb 's fabulous Mint Hotel
DUKE: You bastards !
GONZO: Music ! Turn it up . Put that tape on .
DUKE: What tape ?
GONZO: Jefferson Airplane . `` White Rabbit . '' I want a rising sound .
DUKE: You 're doomed . I 'm leaving here in two hours and then they 're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps . Right there in that tub .
GONZO: I dig my own graves . Green wate and the White Rabbit . Put it on .
DUKE: OK . But do me one last favor , will you . Can you give me two hours ? That 's all I ask just two hours to sleep before tomorrow . I suspect it 's going to be a very difficult day .
GONZO: Of course , I 'm your attorney , I 'll give you all the time you need , at my normal rates $ 45 an hour but you 'll be wanting a cushion , so , why do n't you just lay one of those $ 100 bills down there beside the adio , and fuck off ?
DUKE: How about a check ?
GONZO: Whatever 's right .
DUKE: Shit , he 's killing himself !
GONZO: I want that fucking radio !
DUKE: Do n't touch it ! Get back in that tub !
GONZO: Back the tape up . I need it again ! Let it roll ! Just as high as the fucker can go ! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the abbit bites its own head off , I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING
DUKE: Not me . It would blast you through the wall stone dead in ten seconds and they 'd make me explain it !
GONZO: BULLSHIT ! Do n't make me use this .
DUKE: Jesus .
GONZO: Do it ! I want to get HIGHER ! DUKE considers this . He 's had enough .
DUKE: Okay . You 're right . This is probably the only solution . Let me make sure I have it all lined up . You want me to throw this thing into the tub when `` WHITE RABBIT '' peaks . Is that it ?
GONZO: Fuck yes . I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it .
DUKE: Are you ready ?
GONZO: You bastard ! You 'd do that , would n't you ?
DUKE: Why worry ? You 'll like it . Nothing in the world like a Mace high . Forty-five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves
GONZO: You cheap honky sonofabitch
DUKE: Why not ? Hell , just a minute ago , you were asking me to kill you ! And now you want to kill me ! What I should do , goddamnit , is call the police !
GONZO: The cops ?
DUKE: There 's no choice . I would n't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife !
GONZO: Who said anything about slicing you up ? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead . Nothing serious .
DUKE: Get back in that tub . Eat some eds and try to calm down . Smoke some grass , shoot some smack shit , do whatever you have to do , ut let me get some rest .
GONZO: Hell , yes . You really need some sleep . You have to work . Goddamn . What a bummer . Try to rest . Do n't let me keep you up .
MUSICIAN: What 's the trouble ?
DUKE: Well , all this white stuff on my sleeve is LSD .
BELL BOY: Room service !
DUKE: How would Horatio Alger have handled this situation ?
CLERK'S VOICE: MR. DUKE !
DUKE: Well , why not ? Many fine books have been written in prison .
CLERK: Sir ? This telegram came for you . Actually , it is n't for you . It 's for somebody named Thompson , but it says 'care of Raoul Duke ' . does that make sense ?
DUKE: Yes It makes sense . DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket .
CLERK: I checked the register for this man Thompson . We do n't show him but I figured he might be part of you team .
DUKE: He is . Do n't worry , I 'll get it to him .
CLERK: What confused us was Dr. Gonzo 's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles . When we knew he was right here in the hotel .
DUKE: You did the right thing . Never try to understand a press message . About half the time we use codes especially with Dr. Gonzo .
CLERK: Tell me . When will the doctor be awake ?
DUKE: Awake ? What do you mean ?
CLERK: Well the manager , Mr. Heem , would like to meet him . Nothing unusual . Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts put them on a personal basis just a chat and a handshake , you understand .
DUKE: Of course . But if I were you , I 'd leave the Doctor alone until afte he 's eaten breakfast . He 's a very crude man .
CLERK: But he will be available ? Perhaps later this morning ?
DUKE: Look . That telegram was all scrambled . It was actually from Thompson , not to him . Western Union must have gotten the names eversed . I have to get going . I have to get out to the track .
CLERK: There 's no hurry ! The race is over !
DUKE: Not for me . He waves the CLERK off the car roars away .
CLERK: Let 's have lunch !
DUKE: Righto !
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Just what the FUCK did you think you were doing ? ! DUKE smiles .
DUKE: Of course , officer .
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Could I have that , please ?
DUKE: Why not ? It was getting warm anyway .
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: You realize
DUKE: Yeah . I know . I 'm guilty . I understand that . I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway . Shit , why argue ? I 'm a fucking criminal .
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: That 's a strange attitude . He looks at DUKE thoughtfully .
DUKE: A nap wo n't help . I 've been awake for too long three or fou nights . I ca n't even remember . If I go to sleep now , I 'm dead fo twenty hours . The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles .
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Okay . Here 's how it is . What goes into my book , as of noon , is that I apprehended you for driving too fast , and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area your stated destination , right ? Where you plan to take a long nap . Do I make myself clear ?
DUKE: How far is Baker ? I was hoping to stop there for lunch .
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Not my jurisdiction . The city limits are two point two miles eyond the rest area . Can you make it that far ?
DUKE: I 'll try . I 've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time . I 've heard a lot about it .
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Excellent seafood . With a mind like yours , you 'll probably want to try the land-crab . Try the Majestic Diner . The PATROLMAN slams the door shut .
DUKE: Great Jesus , it 's him .
GONZO: Who ? You sound a little paranoid .
DUKE: You bastard ! I need a lawye immediately !
GONZO: What are you doing in Baker ? Did n't you get my telegram ?
DUKE: What ? Fuck telegrams . I 'm in trouble . You worthless bastard . I 'll cripple your ass for this ! All that shit in the car is yours ! You understand that ? When I finish testifying out here you 'll be disbarred !
GONZO: You 're supposed to be in Vegas . We have a suite at the Flamingo . I was just about to leave for the airport .
GONZO'S VOICE: You brainless scumbag ! You 're supposed to be covering the National District Attorney 's conference ! I made all the reservations rented a white Cadillac convertible the whole thing is arranged ! What the hell are you doing out there in the middle of the fucking desert ?
DUKE: Never mind . It 's all a big joke . I 'm actually sitting beside the pool at the Flamingo . I 'm talking from a portable phone . Some dwarf ought it out from the casino . I have total credit ! Can you grasp that ? Do n't come anywhere near this place ! Foreigners are n't welcome here ! DUKE , breathing heavily , hangs up phone .
POLICE CHIEF: What do you mean I 'm too late to egister ? I 'm a police chief . From Michigan . Look , fella , I told you . I have a postcard here that says I have reservations in this hotel .
CLERK: I 'm sorry , sir . You 're on the `` late list . '' Your reservations were transferred to the ah Moonlight Motel , which is out on Paradise Boulevard
POLICE CHIEF: I 've already paid for my goddamn oom !
CLERK: It 's actually a very fine place of lodging and only sixteen blocks from here , with its own pool and
POLICE CHIEF: You dirty little faggot ! Call the manager ! I 'm tired of listening to this dogshit ! FRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF .
CLERK: I 'm so sorry , sir . May I call you a cab ?
DUKE: Say . I hate to interrupt , but I wonder if maybe I could just sort of slide through and get out of your way . Name 's Raoul Duke Raoul Duke . My attorney made the eservation .
CLERK: Certainly , Mr. Duke !
DUKE: My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible . Can you have someone drive it around to the room ? ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE .
CLERK: Do n't worry about a thing , sir . Just enjoy your stay .
DUKE: Well , thank you .
GONZO: It ca n't be helped . This is Lucy . You knowlike `` Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds . '' LUCY eyes DUKE venomously .
LUCY: I drew these from TV .
GONZO: Fantastic . She came all the way down here from Montana just to give these portraits to Barbra . We 're going over to the Americana Hotel tonight to meet her backstage DUKE 's voice rises above GONZO .
DUKE: Well , I guess they brought the ca ound by now . LET 'S GET THE STUFF
GONZO: Absolutely , LET 'S GET THE STUFF . Now , we 'll be right back . Do n't answer the phone if it rings .
LUCY: God bless .
DUKE: WELL ? What are your plans ?
GONZO: Plans ?
DUKE: Lucy .
GONZO: Shit . I met her on the plane and I had all that acid . You know , those little blue barrels . I gave her a cap before I realized she 's a religious freak Jesus , she 's never even had a drink .
DUKE: Well It 'll probably work out . We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention . GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE .
GONZO: Listen , she 's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months . It 's terrible .
DUKE: She 's perfect for this gig . These cops will go fifty bucks a head to eat her into submission and then gang fuck her . We can set her up in one of these back street motels , hang pictures of Jesus all over the oom , then turn these pigs loose on her Hell she 's strong ; she 'll hold her own . GONZO 's face twitches badly .
GONZO: Jesus Christ . I knew you were sick ut I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff .
DUKE: It 's straight economics . This girl is a god-send . Shit , she can make us a grand a day .
GONZO: NO ! Stop talking like that .
DUKE: I figure she can do about four at a time . Christ , if we keep her full of acid that 's more like two grand a day . Maybe three .
GONZO: You filthy bastard . I should cave your fucking head in .
DUKE: In a few hours , she 'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced y some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD , dragged he to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in he ody with his throbbing , uncircumcised member . GONZO starts crying .
GONZO: NO ! I felt sorry for the girl , I wanted to help her !
DUKE: You 'll go straight to the gas chamber . And even if you manage to eat that , they 'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consensual Sodomy . She 's got to go . Pause .
GONZO: Shit , it does n't pay to try to help somebody these days . A silence .
DUKE: What ? What kind of goddamn monster are you ?
GONZO: It just occurred to me , that she has no witnesses . Anything that she says about us is completely worthless .
DUKE: Us ?
GONZO: Okay , Lucy , it 's time to go meet Barbra
DUKE: That 's good . You ca n't be subtle in this town .
GONZO: As your attorney , I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline .
DUKE: Maybe we should take it easy tonight .
GONZO: Right . Let 's find a good seafood estaurant and eat some red salmon . I feel a powerful lust for red salmon
DUKE: Come on , we 're going to be late .
GONZO: This goddamn mescaline . Why the fuck ca n't they make it a little less pure ? Maybe mix it up with Rolaids or something .
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: On behalf of the prosecuting attorneys of this county , I welcome you to the Third National DA 's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs .
GONZO: I saw these bastards in Easy Rider , ut I did n't believe they were real . Not like this . Not hundreds of them !
DUKE: They 're actually nice people when you get to know them .
GONZO: Man , I know these people in my goddamn blood !
DUKE: Do n't mention that word around here . You 'll get them excited .
GONZO: This is a fucking nightmare .
DUKE: Right . Sure as hell some dope- dealing bomb freak is going to ecognize you and put the word out that you 're partying with a thousand cops .
DR. BLUMQUIST: We must come to terms with the Drug Culture in the country country country The sound systems echoes .
GONZO: What the fuck are these people talking about ? You 'd have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn cockroach !
DR. BLUMQUIST: Now , there are four states of being in the cannabis , or marijuana , society Cool , Groovy , Hip , and Square . The square is seldom if ever cool . He is not `` with it , '' that is , he does n't know `` what 's happening . '' But if he manages to figure it out , he moves up a notch to `` hip . '' DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief .
GONZO: I know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit .
DUKE: Pardon me , I feel sick .
FILM NARRATOR: He will stagger and babble when questioned . He will not respect your badge . The Dope Fiend fears nothing . He will attack , for no eason , with every weapon at his command including yours DUKE heads for the exit .
DUKE: Sorry , sick Beg pardon ! Feeling sick
FILM NARRATOR: BEWARE . Any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately . One stitch in time will usually save nine on you .
DA: I 'm a whiskey man myself . We do n't have much trouble from drugs where I come from
GONZO: You will . One of these nights you 'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart .
DA: Naw !
GONZO: They 'll climb right into you edroom and sit on your chest with ig Bowie knives . They might even sit on your wife 's chest . Put the lade right down on her throat .
DA: Not down in my parts . DUKE joins them .
DUKE: Rum and ice , please .
DA: You 're another one of these California boys . Your friend here 's been tellin ' us about dope fiends .
DUKE: They 're everywhere . Nobody 's safe . And sure as hell not in the South . They like warm weather You 'd never believe it . In L.A. it 's out of control . First it was drugs , now it 's witchcraft .
DA: Witchcraft ? Shit , you ca n't mean it !
GONZO: Read the newspapers .
DUKE: Man , you do n't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice !
DA: Naw ! That 's science fiction stuff !
DUKE: Not where we operate .
GONZO: Hell , in Malibu alone , these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day . All they want is the blood . They 'll take people right off the street if they have to .
DUKE: Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald 's hamburger stand . She was a waitress , about sixteen years old with a lot of people watching , too !
DA: What happened ? What did they do to her ?
GONZO: Do ? Jesus Christ , man . They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot ! Then they cut all kinds of holes in he head and sucked out the blood !
DA: And nobody did anything ?
DUKE: What could they do ? The guy that took the head was about six-seven , and maybe three-hundred pounds . He was packing two Lugers , and the others had M-16s .
GONZO: They just ran back out into Death Valley you know , where Manson turned up
DUKE: Like big lizards .
GONZO: and every one of them stacked naked
DA: Naked ! ?
DUKE: Naked .
GONZO: Yeh , naked ! except for the weapons .
DUKE: They were all veterans .
DA: Veterans ? ! ! ! ?
GONZO: Yeh . The big guy used to be a major in the Marines .
DA: A major !
GONZO: We know where he lives , but we ca n't get near the house .
DA: Naw ! Not a major .
GONZO: He wanted the pineal gland .
DA: Really ?
GONZO: That 's how he got so big . When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy .
DUKE: Usually , it 's whole families . During the night . Most of them do n't even wake up until they feel their heads going and then , of course , it 's too late . The glass smashes in the BARTENDER 's hand .
WAITRESS: Are you guys with the police convention upstairs ?
DA: We sure are , Miss .
WAITRESS: I thought so . I never heard that kind of talk around here before . Jesus Christ ! How do you guys stand that kind of work ?
GONZO: We like it . It 's groovy . The WAITRESS stares sickened at GONZO .
DUKE: What 's wrong with you ? Hell , somebody has to do it .
GONZO: Hurry up with those drinks . We 're thirsty . Only two rums . Make mine a Bloody Mary .
DA: Hell , I really hate to hear this . Because everything that happens in California seems to get down ou way , sooner or later . Mostly Atlanta . But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful . All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance . They did n't oam around much But now Jesus , it seems nobody 's safe .
GONZO: You 're going to need to take the ull by the horns go to the mat with this scum .
DA: What do you mean by that ?
GONZO: You know what I mean . We 've done it before and we can damn well do it again !
DUKE: Cut their goddamn heads off . Every one of them . That 's what we 're doing in California .
GONZO: Sure . It 's all on the Q.T. , but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line .
DUKE: We keep it quiet . It 's not the kind of thing you 'd want to talk about upstairs . Not with the press around .
DA: Hell , no . We 'd never hear the goddamn end of it .
DUKE: Dobermans do n't talk .
DA: What ?
GONZO: Sometimes it 's easier to just rip out the backstraps .
DUKE: They 'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs .
DA: God almighty ! I do n't think I should tell my wife about this . She 'd never understand . You know how women are .
DUKE: Just be thankful your heart is young and strong .
GONZO: What ? The telephone rings . DUKE answers .
CLERK: Mr. Duke ? Hello , Mr. Duke , I 'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago I thought I should call again , because I was wondering
DUKE: WHAT ? What was that crazy bitch said to him ? There 's a war on , man ! People are eing killed !
GONZO: Good work . They 'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that .
DUKE: Lucy is looking for you .
GONZO: No , she 's looking for you .
DUKE: Me ?
GONZO: She really flipped over you . The only way I could get rid of her was y saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself . I guess she figures you won . That phone message was n't for me , was it ? A look of stunned realization from DUKE
LUCY: Yessir , those two men in the dock are the ones who gave me the LSD and took me to the hotel .
JUDGE: Twenty years and Double Castration ! The JUDGE bangs his gavel .
GONZO: Wait ! You ca n't leave me alone in this snake pit . This room is in my name .
DUKE: It 's gone too far .
GONZO: Relax . Let me handle this . You 'd make a piss-poor lawyer . Room 1600 , please . As your attorney , I advise you not to worry . Take a hit out of that little brown ottle in my shaving kit .
DUKE: What is this ?
GONZO: You wo n't need much . Just a little tiny taste , that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer . Adrenochrome . DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle .
DUKE: Adrenochrome
GONZO: Hi , Lucy ? Yeah , it 's me . I got your messagewhat ? Hell , no , I taught the bastard a lesson he 'll never forget what ? No , not dead , but he wo n't be bothering anybody for a while . Yeah . I left him out there , I stomped him , then pulled all his teeth out
GONZO: Well . That 's that . She 's probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now . That 's the last we should be hearing from Lucy . Where 's the opium ?
DUKE: Where 'd you get this ?
GONZO: Never mind , it 's absolutely pure .
DUKE: Jesus what kind of monste client have you picked up this time ? There 's only one source for this stuff the adrenaline gland from a living human body ! GONZO turns to smile at DUKE .
GONZO: I know , but the guy did n't have any cash to pay me . He 's one of these Satanism freaks . He offered me human blood said it would take me higher than I 've ever been in my life . I thought he was kidding , so I told him I 'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome o maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on .
DUKE: Why not ? We should get some of that . Just eat a big handful and see what happens .
GONZO: Some of what ?
DUKE: Extract of pineal !
GONZO: Sure . That 's a good idea . One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia .
DUKE: Right !
GONZO: grow claws bleeding warts .
DUKE: Yes !
GONZO: then you 'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on you ack
DUKE: Fantastic !
GONZO: you 'd go blind your body would turn to wax they 'd have to put you in a wheelbarrow and
DUKE: FINISH THE FUCKING STORY ! What happened ? ! What about the glands ?
GONZO: Jesus , that stuff got right on top of you , did n't it .
DUKE: Maybe you could just shove me into the pool , or something GONZO shakes his head disgustedly .
GONZO: If I put you in the pool right now , you 'd sink like a goddamn stone . You took too much . Jesus , look at your face , you 're about to explode . GONZO sits back down watching the TV .
NIXON: Sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice
MAID: Please please I 'm only the maid . I did n't mean nothin !
GONZO: She must have used a pass key . I was polishing my shoes in the closet when I noticed her sneaking in-so I took her . DUKE shakes his head .
DUKE: What made you do it ? Who paid you off ?
MAID: Nobody . I 'm the maid !
GONZO: You 're lying ! You were after the evidence . Who put you up to this the manager ?
MAID: I do n't know what you 're talking about !
GONZO: Bullshit ! You 're just as much a part of it as they are !
MAID: Part of what ?
DUKE: The dope ring . You must know what 's going on in this hotel . Why do you think we 're here ?
MAID: I know you 're cops , but I thought you were just here for that convention . I swear ! All I wanted to do was clean up the room . I do n't know anything about dope ! GONZO laughs .
GONZO: Come on , baby do n't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman .
MAID: No ! No ! I swear to Jesus I neve heard of that stuff !
DUKE: Maybe she 's telling the truth . Maybe she 's not part of it .
MAID: No ! I swear I 'm not !
GONZO: In that case , maybe she can help .
MAID: Yes ! I 'll help you all you need ! I hate dope !
DUKE: So do we , lady .
GONZO: I think we should put her on the payroll . See what she comes up with .
DUKE: Do you think you can handle it ?
MAID: What ?
GONZO: One phone call every day . Just tell us what you 've seen . Do n't worry if it does n't add up , that 's our problem . GONZO hustles the MAID to the door .
MAID: You 'd pay me for that ?
DUKE: You 're damn right . But the first time you say anything about this , to anybody you 'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life . What 's your name ?
MAID: Alice . Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice .
GONZO: Alright , Alice you 'll be contacted by Inspector Rock . Arthur Rock . He 'll be posing as a politician .
DUKE: Inspector Rock will pay you . In cash . A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month .
MAID: Oh Lord ! I 'd do just about anything for that !
GONZO: You and a lot of other people .
DUKE: The password is `` One Hand Washes The Other . '' The minute you hea that , you say `` I fear nothing . ''
MAID: I fear nothing .
GONZO: Oh , and do n't bother to make up the oom . That way we wo n't have to isk another of these little incidents , will we ?
MAID: Whatever you say , gentlemen . I ca n't tell you how sorry I am about what happened
GONZO: Do n't worry , it 's all over now . Thank God for the decent people .
SHOPPER #1: Hey ! Is that your car ?

GONZO: Why not ? But for Christ 's sake , just do it fast !
DUKE: Hey ! GONZO stops turns .
GONZO: Yeah Explaining my Position . Some asshole wrote a poem about that once GONZO pauses .
DUKE: We are all wired into a survival trip now . No more of the speed that fueled that 60 's . That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary 's trip . He crashed around America selling `` consciousness expansion '' without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously

TUFFY: And Red Mountain . Your daughter . Heroine looks over , making eye contact .
HEROINE: Right .
BEER GUY: This is goddamn depressing .
BOSS MAN: I 've got some tools and extra planks in the kitchen , if we 're on the same page here .
HEROINE: Let 's work .
BARTENDER: We 'll it ai n't pretty
BOSS MAN: But its got teeth .
BOZO: I think it 's hungry again .
HEROINE: We have to kill it . Can you help ?
BOSS MAN: Fire in the hole !
BOZO: I think we got
TUFFY: You 're welcome . She hands the shotgun back to Bartender .
TRAMPY: Jesus , it took all that ? All those ullets ? How can we possibly fight off the others ?
HEROINE: Aim for their orifices . Eyes , ears and mouth . From what I 've seen , it 's their only weakness .
ROADIE: Looks like they 're soft on the inside like any other animal . Trick is to get in there and do the damage .
BELLE: Maybe we do n't have to fight them .
BOZO: Right , let 's just call 'em names . Coach steps forward , poised to make the sale .
COACH: Ladies and gentlemen , if I may have your attention .
ADULTERER: How ?
COACH: I need a stick .
HEROINE: What are you doing ?
COACH: Showing superiority . The scent of their dead may drive them away .
BEER GUY: I do n't see them .
COACH: Come on . Come onnnnnn .
BELLE: Is there a call , or something ?
BOZO: See that you monkey fucks ! That 's what you get when you mess with us ! Woman or man , I do n't give a fuck ! Shit do n't make me gay because you 'll e sucking my dick ! Bozo 's insult hangs in the air .
PARA: Sweet
BEER GUY: It 's working . I think it 's working .
COACH: You see ? What I tell you ?
ADULTERER: Good christ ! They 're cannibals !
COACH: Oh dear
TRAMPY: Oh my god .
PARA: What are they doing now ?
BOZO: Dude , they 're humpin ' !
HEROINE: Get back !
BOZO: Any more ideas , Animal Planet ?
COACH: I-I-I was just being proactive
BEER GUY: Hey , you were n't helpin ' !
BOZO: Go douche .
BARTENDER: What the hell now ?
ADULTERER: We 're stuck in here . That 's what .
ROADIE: Hey , Miss ? Heroine turns .
BOSS MAN: More importantly , how did you run away from these things ?
HEROINE: Well , it all started about forty hours ago
HERO: Holy mother of
HEROINE: We barricaded ourselves in the cellar . Then it was just listening . We heard those things destroy an entire heard of livestock . They just kept coming . Closer and closer , consuming anything in the way . Slashing , feeding and licking the bones clean . Just when we said our prayers , the first ray of sun hit the house
HERO: What 's goin ' on ? The pumps are off .
TUBBS: There 's nobody here
HEROINE: They 've been here !
HERO: Turn on the pump !
HEROINE: We had no time . All we knew was the sun was dropping and we had to get enough fuel to make it through the night at 90 miles per hour
HERO: Suck it down you metal bitch . Suck it down .
HEROINE: It happened fast
HERO: Move it !
HEROINE: That 's when I saw three others just for a second .
HERO: Roll !
HEROINE: Close the roof !
HERO: Shit !
HEROINE: It must have smelled the blood o something . We buried the body and got back on the main road when
HERO: Break !
HEROINE: And that 's how I ended up here .
BARTENDER: And the head ?
HEROINE: I do n't want to talk about that .
BARTENDER: So , your husband ditched you ?
HEROINE: No . It was wild out there . No time to think . We just moved . He did n't leave me . He just ran .
BARTENDER: Well , justice is funny .
ROADIE: The three from the gas pump are ove at the TV station ? And you say there 's four here , huh ?
HEROINE: It appears so .
COACH: There 's five here now , actually .
BOZO: Yeah , thanks for that .
PARA: Hey , you lived on a farm , right ?
HEROINE: Yeah .
ADULTERER: Do you think they 're gone ? I have n't heard anything for a while , maybe they 're gone .
BELLE: Well , maybe they migrate ?
HEROINE: As long as it 's dark , they 're around . They hide , wait for you to drop you guard , and then attack .
TRAMPY: How can you be so sure ? You said yourself this started a day ago .
HEROINE: We learned fast .
BOZO: We ? We learned fast ? You are all that is left of we . No offense Pocohantas , but I think someone else should play `` Chief '' tonight . Someone that knows the lay of the land . Like me .
HEROINE: Fine .
ADULTERER: Maybe these things are like locusts or something and only come out for a few days to feed . This could just be a part of their life cycle .
BELLE: Somebody 's got ta know something about these things . This stuff just does n't happen out of the blue .
BOZO: You !
GRANDPA: Wha ?
BOZO: You got ta know somethin ' , you 're old .
GRANDPA: I do n't know a thing .
BOZO: Old people know stuff like this . Legends , tall tales , shit like that .
GRANDPA: No !
BOZO: Spill it !
GRANDPA: I do n't know anything !
BOZO: How 'bout you ? Or do I have to get ough ?
GRANDMA: Heavens no !
BOZO: Come on ! Think back !
GRANDPA: If I throw a stick , will you go away ?
BOZO: That 's just horse shit .
HEROINE: Relax , they do n't know anything .
BOZO: Yeah allegedly . Bozo saunters off .
PARA: Hey , where was your farm ?
HEROINE: East . Why ?
PARA: Did you ever slaughter ? Slaughte livestock ?
HEROINE: Previous owners did , I think .
COACH: What are you talking about ?
PARA: Slaughterhouse run-off used to be drained into piping that ran through the mountains . Para points along the map as he explains .
COACH: Cheese n ' rice
TRAMPY: I still do n't get it .
PARA: What I am saying is there 's a distinct possibility that what we are up against is the result of steady stream of blood and tissue that has een leaking into the caves . And a day ago something broke out . The group is silent .
BOZO: The first order of business is gettin ' a big fuckin ' tampon in that cave !
PARA: Nope , that would n't do it .
BARTENDER: I would n't do that .
BOZO: They 're probably on to the next buffet y now . There 's a retirement home up the road , they 'd be easy pickings .
HEROINE: Careful .
ADULTERER: I 'm telling you , I do n't see a thing
HEROINE: Everyone stay in the middle of the oom ! Off the walls ! NOW !
BOZO: Duh . Trampy holds Adulterer 's wounded head .
TRAMPY: He 's out cold .
BELLE: I know some first aid if we have a kit . Do we ?
BOSS MAN: In the kitchen , under the sink .
HEROINE: No one goes anywhere alone . Least of all , unarmed .
TUFFY: There 's some sweats in my bag behind the bar .
COACH: Thanks .
ROADIE: You 're a clever man . Why do you take shit from him ?
PARA: Yeah , he 's an ass , but he 's my other . Que sera-sera .
ROADIE: Your brother , huh ?
PARA: Yep .
ROADIE: Same parents ?
PARA: Look man , I read books . He reads umper stickers .
HEROINE: Alright , we need to stay alert and for everyone to take a role . You got ta have some guns or weapons around here .
BOSS MAN: I got my .38 here . That 's six shots and two refills . Downstairs , I have locker with a sawed-off and some gardening tools . Maybe a few boxes of shells .
BARTENDER: I got shells , too . Box and a half tops . Machete behind the bar .
HEROINE: Okay , well that 's something .
ROADIE: So we 've got guns , kitchen knives , pipes , fire and sticks . Beer Guy scans the stocked bar wall .
BEER GUY: I might be able to do something with the bottles .
GRANDPA: You 're gon na need a whole lot more than that to get outta here alive . The crowd turns to face Grandpa and his wife .
BOZO: Oh , now you have something to say ?
GRANDPA: You young'uns worry about weapons , I 'm thinkin ' 'bout strategy .
BOZO: Oh ? And what 's that ?
GRANDPA: Sit still , look less like a meal .
BOZO: That 's for bears and sharks , chunky chew . The group looks back to Heroine .
HEROINE: Alright , what else do we have ? Can we somehow contact the outside world ?
TRAMPY: I ca n't get anybody . I do n't even know if I have a signal anymore .
BEER GUY: I have a CB in my truck , we could get some help out here .
BARTENDER: Who the hell would you call ?
BEER GUY: Anyone .
BOZO: Do you drive a short beer bus o something ? You go out there , you get eaten . You stay in here , you get eaten . Anyone comes to help , they get eaten . Do n't you see a pattern here , Spuds Makenzie ?
BEER GUY: Then I guess we should just give up .
BOZO: Believe me , I 'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch , but it 's not in the cards , partner .
HEROINE: You said you had a short wave radio .
TRAMPY: Where ?
BARTENDER: Upstairs .
BOSS MAN: Go for it . It 's by the far wall . Channel 9 is the emergency frequency .
HEROINE: Good . I 'm heading to the basement for supplies . And you 're going upstairs . Bozo blinks . A little taken aback .
BOZO: Let 's not get carried away
HEROINE: Step up , Chief .
BOZO: So that 's how it is ? Fine ! Shotgun , please . Bartender hands him The Judge .
BARTENDER: I 'll wait by the door .
BOZO: Now who else is comin ' ? No one budges .
GRANDPA: I 'll go with ya .
BOZO: What are you gon na do ? Throw you teeth at 'em ? Sit down , Cocoon .
HEROINE: No . You 're locked in .
BOZO: What ?
HEROINE: Those two will be on the other side waiting for you . If you become food , I do n't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things .
BOZO: Do n't get your hopes up .
HEROINE: Any volunteers to head into the asement with me ?
TUFFY: I will .
BEER GUY: That 's not a good idea .
BOSS MAN: With what happened upstairs
TUFFY: Shut up ! Shut your mouth . You have no idea what is running through me ight now . No idea . I 'm ready .
HEROINE: Alright .
ROADIE: Count me in .
BEER GUY: Me too .
BOZO: Alright you two , I do n't want to hear any of this , `` oh , I dropped the key , wrong key , ai n't no key here . '' When I want out , I want out , ok ?
BARTENDER: They 're right here .
COACH: We 've got your back , bro . They unlock the door , swinging it open .
BOZO: Just keep 'em handy , ladies .
BOZO: Wish me luck WHAM ! Bozo is on the ground .
BOZO: Come on . Come on . Come on .
BELLE: How are you holding up ?
BOSS MAN: Well
BELLE: What is this ?
BOSS MAN: Morphine . My magic potion . I need a few drops .
BELLE: No other time than now , right ?
BOSS MAN: Wait , before you do that , help me move . There 's a small room off the kitchen where I can lay down .
BELLE: But
BOSS MAN: It 's much safer in there . Trust me .
ROADIE: Stay on your toes everybody .
HEROINE: What 's this ?
ROADIE: You do n't need to know what that is . Beer Guy finds the dusty locker and opens it .
BEER GUY: There 's a sawed-off shotgun in here .
COACH: Come on , bro .
BOZO: Lamaze . Lamaze . Lamaze .
BOZO: Just a bat ! I 'm okay ! Just a bat !
BARTENDER: If he does n't shut up
COACH: He is human kabob .
BELLE: Does n't your foot hurt ?
BOSS MAN: I ca n't feel a thing , Hon .
BELLE: How 'bout now ?
BOSS MAN: You 're a bad girl , are n't you .
BELLE: Um-hmmm .
BOSS MAN: The girl 's got rhythm .
ROADIE: This is all junk . Beer Guy holds a rusted machete .
BEER GUY: This could come in handy .
HEROINE: Let 's get everything upstairs .
TUFFY: Do n't worry , I 'm fine . Really .
HEROINE: I admire your strength .
TUFFY: Trust me , I plan on having a full eakdown when this is over , but fo now , we all have to be strong , right ?
HEROINE: This is my daughter , Charlie . She 's all I 'm after .

TUFFY: You have it .
HEROINE: Good . But still do me a favor .

BELLE: You wan na see , baby ?
BOSS MAN: Hell yeah .
BELLE: How much you got ?
BOSS MAN: How much I got , what ?
BELLE: How much you got to see the show ?
BOSS MAN: You do n't understand , sweety . Daddy does n't pay . Daddy sees the show fo free . But you do get points for being horny on a night like this . She cringes and backs up a little .
BELLE: What ?
BOSS MAN: You ca n't expect a man to buy a ca without a test drive first , can you ?
BELLE: Um , hmm
BOSS MAN: Now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy 's face , I wan na do some appraising .
BOZO: Repeat . We need help . SOS . Calling all cars ! Calling all cars ! We need help at the United Nations Tav
BARTENDER: Oh !

PARA: I thought that was it for a second there .
TRAMPY: What happened ?
BOZO: I got Papa in the stones . He 's neutered .
PARA: Whoa good one
ROADIE: That back room is sealed shut . Heroine glares at Boss Man .
HEROINE: I told you to stay in the main room .
BOSS MAN: Yeah I will . I will . Promise .
COACH: If they ca n't reproduce anymore we are one step closer ! A big step ! Now is the time to band together . We need to rise up against these monsters of the night ! Those creatures are no match for the human spirit ! We can do it ! We just need to believe in each other ! In all of us ! We need to make a stand ! Right here ! Right now ! Long silence . Bozo stares .
BOZO: Dude , are you gay ? Coach sits down , humbled .
HEROINE: We know what not to do . We must stay focused and together . The beasts will find a breach . We got ta find a way out before they find a way in .
TUFFY: Let 's run for the cars , cause mass confusion .
BARTENDER: The lot 's too damn far , that 's surefire suicide .
HEROINE: What ?
BOSS MAN: What ?
HEROINE: You know what .
BOSS MAN: I do n't know shit .
HEROINE: You . What was that door downstairs ?
BOSS MAN: Wait , wait , wait . Heroine glares at Roadie .
HEROINE: Do n't bullshit me .
BARTENDER: It 's a tunnel . Roadie nods , causing Boss Man to sigh .
HEROINE: What 's it for ? They clam up .
BOSS MAN: Grass , man . I grow pot down there .
HEROINE: Does the tunnel spit out near a car ?
BOSS MAN: It spits out behind the parking lot .
HEROINE: It 's a shot . Is it gassed up ?
BOSS MAN: Fully .
HEROINE: Four door ?
BOSS MAN: Two .
HEROINE: How many can it hold ?
BOSS MAN: Six .
HEROINE: Max ?
BOSS MAN: Seven .
HEROINE: It 's gon na fit thirteen .
BOSS MAN: Thirteen clowns would n't fit .
HEROINE: Keys .
ROADIE: What 're you planning ?
HEROINE: Three of us go . Two to defend , one to drive . We back up to the bar and then tear ass out of here .
BOSS MAN: Sounds sketchy .
HEROINE: Let me make this clear ; if we stay , we die .
ROADIE: Give 'em to me , I 'm going .
BARTENDER: You 're trusting that con ? He 'll ditch us and never look back .
ROADIE: Fuck you too .
BARTENDER: Get in line !
HEROINE: Hey ! I 'm not trusting him either , that 's why I 'm going with . Coach stands forward .
COACH: `` Courage is being scared to death , ut saddling up anyway . '' The Duke . I will go .
HEROINE: This is it . They have this place surrounded , but if we go under them we might just make it .
BARTENDER: This is a bottleneck waiting to happen . SMACK ! Bozo SLAPS Coach 's ass .
BOZO: This one 's great under pressure . I wish you luck .
HEROINE: The rest of you prepare the weapons , whatever you got left . 'Cause when we crash through those walls , we 're ingin ' death with us .
COACH: No , I do n't believe in guns .
BARTENDER: This ai n't time for a political stance . Coach takes the rusty machete from Beer Guy .
COACH: This does n't run out of ammo .
BARTENDER: Got ya .
BOZO: Hey !
TRAMPY: How does it feel ?
ADULTERER: Lousy .
TRAMPY: You still have one left .
ADULTERER: Yes , the silver lining .
TRAMPY: It serves you right for cheating .
ADULTERER: Spare me .
TRAMPY: I figure it 's karma . You wronged me and you wronged your wife , so this is karma biting you on the ass , o in your case in the eye . Bozo moves close , surveying the bandage work .
BOZO: Oh yeah ?
TRAMPY: It could be worse , you could be dead . Then again , the climax is upon us .
BOZO: Ya know , that 's not a bad look on you . Kinda 1985 , but not bad . I 'd hook it up .
TRAMPY: I would n't fuck you for practice .
BOZO: Tease .
ADULTERER: Leave her alone .
BOZO: Hey , cyclops . Let 's have a quiet contest starting now . Bozo turns his attention back to Trampy .
ROADIE: You handle yourself pretty well . You a cop or a criminal ?
HEROINE: Neither . Just a farmer .
ROADIE: Oh yeah ? Then how do you do it ?
HEROINE: I just think about my husband and daughter and the rest is easy .
ROADIE: This place is creepy in the daytime , too . Ready ? Coach 's hand shakes as he raises his weapon .
COACH: No . You ?
ROADIE: Of course not . I fight monsters all the time . On three . Roadie , Heroine raise their weapons .
COACH: One two three ! ! ! Roadie whips open the door . Nothing .
HEROINE: Let 's go .
COACH: Looks like a brothel for plants .
ROADIE: Shhhhhhhhhhhhh .
BOZO: Ah-ah-ah ! You 're doing that all wrong !
BEER GUY: What do you know ?
BOZO: I know you 're doing it wrong .
BEER GUY: Prove it .
BOZO: Move aside , princess .
COACH: You and I are similar . We both have accents . We both travel a lot . We oth do n't really have homes
ROADIE: You should be quiet .
COACH: I am sorry , I ramble when I 'm nervous .
HEROINE: Quiet . Coach bites his lip , dying to say something .
COACH: It 's just that this seems like the opportune time for someone to be horribly offed .
ROADIE: What did I say ?
COACH: Sorry . I 'm done now .
BOZO: You do n't want the rag touching booze , that way you can hold it and ensure it explodes when you throw it .
PARA: You sure ? I thought the rag had to touch ?
BOZO: I 'm sure .
PARA: Genius .
BEER GUY: You are n't nearly as dumb as you look , are you ?
BOZO: Next time , look within . Stereotyping can be ugly and hurtful .
ROADIE: Hold up . You hear something ? A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above .
HEROINE: Move .
COACH: Like moles these things .
ROADIE: Duck !
HEROINE: Go ! The bitch is mine !
ROADIE: The shells are wet !
COACH: Grab onto ceiling and get out of water !
ROADIE: What ?
COACH: Do it ! ! !
HEROINE: You fuck with my family . I fuck right back ! Click out of ammo !
COACH: They will write stories of you avery .
ROADIE: If there 's anybody left .
HEROINE: Send it up ! Send it up !
TUFFY: Hey ! Hey ! She 's in the shaft !
HEROINE: Move it ! Move it ! Move it !
BEER GUY: Come on !
BOZO: Ol ' Crazy Horse has seen it .
TUFFY: Shut up !
HEROINE: Goddamn it !
TUFFY: It stopped . It fuckin ' stopped !
TRAMPY: Do something !
ADULTERER: Stop !
TRAMPY: What the fuck are you doing ? !
ADULTERER: They ca n't get in here ! We agreed ! They 'll get us !
TUFFY: She can make it !
ADULTERER: I will not die because of her !
BARTENDER: Do n't be stupid , drop the gun !
ADULTERER: They 'll get in ! We 'll all die !
BOZO: Welcome back .
HEROINE: F-f-fuck you .
BARTENDER: What the hell happened ?
TUFFY: You okay ?
HEROINE: I think they made it . She turns to Adulterer , rigid .
BOZO: Ingenuity , baby . Ingenuity .
HEROINE: I need some shells .
BARTENDER: I have two left .
HEROINE: Let 's prepare ourselves , they ought to be here with the truck any minute .
BOSS MAN: Bullshit .
HEROINE: That 's your choice , but this is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets any better . Boss Man shrugs , content with himself .
BOSS MAN: If all of you run for it , they wo n't care about lil ol ' me . They like the food that moves
HEROINE: Get on the tables ! ! ! On the tables ! ! ! Everyone struggles to get on the tables .
PARA: HELP ME ! ! !
BOZO: Bonsai !
BEER GUY: We 're gon na die !
ADULTERER: What the hell ? !
HEROINE: Settle down !
TRAMPY: Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it !
BARTENDER: What 's that ? Tuffy sees what is coming .
TUFFY: They did n't make it .
ROADIE: RUN ! ! !
BARTENDER: That wall 's coming down !
BOZO: Commence Plan B ! The entire group goes into motion .
HEROINE: What 's Plan B ?
BOZO: Just watch the floor and keep the others safe !
HEROINE: Now !
BOZO: One down , one to go ! ! !
HEROINE: Help me !
BARTENDER: I ca n't hold him ! ! !
HEROINE: Do something ! ! !
TUFFY: CHOKE ON IT ! ! !
BARTENDER: God
BOZO: I need to get your number .
HEROINE: Come on , I 'll help you .
GRANDPA: No thank you , we 're content .

HEROINE: She 's still out here .
HEROINE: Come and get me you blood-chugging
TRAMPY: You got her ? You got her !

BEER GUY: When this lights , run like hell .

JEANIE: You 're really letting him stay home ? I ca n't believe this . If I was bleeding out my eyes , you guys 'd make me go to school . It 's so unfair .
FERRIS: Please do n't be upset with me , Jeanie . Be thankful that you 're fit and have your health . Cherish it .
JEANIE: Oh , I wan na puke .
KIMBERLY: Myocardial infarction ?
JOYCE: Get your stuff . Daddy 'll be right down .
KIMBERLY: Syphilitic meningitus ? That would be a huge family embarrassment .
TOM: Get downstairs !
KIMBERLY: If he dies , I got dibs on his stereo . She turns sharply and exits .
TODD: Dad ? Does my head look alright ?
JOYCE: Get downstairs ! Now !
TODD: Just answer me one question ! Is it swelling up ? Kim said it was going to get as big as
JOYCE: Get downstairs ! NOW ! Todd backs out of the room .
FERRIS: I 'll be okay . I 'll just sleep . Maybe I 'll have an aspirin around noon .
JOYCE: I 'm showing houses to the family from California today but I 'll be in the area . My office 'll know where I am , if you need me .
TOM: I 'll check it with you , too .
FERRIS: It 's nice to know I have such loving , caring parents . You 're oth very special people .
JOYCE: I hope you feel better , pumpkin .
TOM: Get some rest .
FERRIS: They bought it . The MTV theme music ROARS IN .
CAMERON: Foodshelternoyes
FERRIS' VOICE: Cameron ! What 's happening ?
CAMERON: Very little .
FERRIS' VOICE: How do you feel ?
CAMERON: Shredded .
FERRIS' VOICE: Is your mother in the room ?
CAMERON: She 's not home . Where are you ?
FERRIS' VOICE: Home .
FERRIS: I 'm taking the day off . Get dressed and come over .
CAMERON'S VOICE: I ca n't . I 'm sick .
FERRIS: It 's all in your head . Come on over .
CAMERON: I feel like complete shit , Ferris . I ca n't go anywhere .
FERRIS' VOICE: I 'm sorry to hear that . Now , come on over and pick me up .
CAMERON: I 'm dying .
FERRIS' VOICE: You 're not dying . You just ca n't think of anything good to do .
FERRIS: If anybody needs a day off , it 's Cameron . He has alot of things to sort out before he graduates . He ca n't be wound this tight and go to college . His roommate 'll kill him . I 've come close myself . But I like him . He 's a little easier to take when you know why he 's like he is . The boy can not relax . Pardon y French but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass , in two weeks you 'd have a diamond . And Cameron would worry that he 'd owe taxes on it .
TEACHER'S VOICE: Albers ?
BOY'S VOICE: Here .
TEACHER'S VOICE: Anderson .
GIRL'S VOICE: Here .
TEACHER'S VOICE: Anheiser ?
BOY'S VOICE: Here .
TEACHER'S VOICE: Busch ?
GIRL'S VOICE: Here .
TEACHER'S VOICE: Bueller ?
GIRL'S VOICE: He 's sick . My best friend 's sister 's boyfriend 's other 's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who 's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night . I guess it 's pretty serious .
TEACHER'S VOICE: Thank you , Simone .
GIRL'S VOICE: No problem whatsoever .
TEACHER'S VOICE: Drucker ?
BOY'S VOICE: What ?
FERRIS: This is really degrading . He comes up with a crumpled dollar bill .
JOYCE: No one 's going to consider a house with a black living room . Not even those jerks from Vermont . Let 's be realistic .
AGENT 1: Mrs. Volbeck 's dead set against putting any money into the house .
JOYCE: Joyce Bueller . Her eyes open wide with alarm .
MAN'S VOICE: Are you aware that your son is not in school today ?
JOYCE'S VOICE: Yes , I am . Ferris is home sick . I had a meeting first thing this morning . I should have called . It completely slipped my mind .
DEAN'S VOICE: Are you also aware that Ferris does not have what we consider an exemplary attendance record ?
JOYCE'S VOICE: I do n't understand .
DEAN'S VOICE: I just had his file up .
ROONEY: I just has his file up , Mrs. Bueller .
JOYCE'S VOICE: This is all news to me .
ROONEY'S VOICE: So far this semester alone , he 's been absent nine times . Including today .
JOYCE'S VOICE: Nine times ?
ROONEY: I have it right here in front of me . He 's missed He looks closer at the screen .
FERRIS: I wanted a car . I got a computer . How 's that for being born under a bad sign ?
JOYCE: I can give you every assurance that Ferris is home and that he is , in fact , very ill . I debated whethe or not I should even leave him . I can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off , but in Ferris ' case , he 's truly a very sick boy .
GIRL: I 'm really sorry about your brother .
JEANIE: What 're you sorry for ? I have to live with the trouser snake .
GIRL: No , I mean I heard he 's really sick .
JEANIE: Who said he 's sick .
GIRL: A whole bunch of people . They said he 's like on the verge of death . Jeanie stares incredulously at the girl .
FERRIS: A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center fo Disease Control . I do n't know , man , I 'm bricking heavily . Freshman . Did you see Alien ? When the guy had the creature in his stomach ? It feels like that .
BOY: Goddamn ! Are you kidding ?
SECOND BOY: What ?
BOY: Did you see Alien ?
SECOND BOY: No .
BOY: You never rented the video cassette ? Second boy shakes his head , no .
THIRD BOY: Who 's he talking to ?
SECOND BOY: Ferris Bueller . You know him ?
THIRD BOY: Yeah . He 's getting me out of summe school .
BOY: Anyway , I appreciate you letting us know how you 're doing . We got ta split . Huh ? Yeah , sure . Hold on .
SECOND BOY: Shit . I hope he does n't die . I ca n't handle summer school . The boy snatches a passing GIRL .
BOY: Did you see Alien ?
GIRL: Yeah , why ? He hands her the phone .
ROONEY: I do n't trust this kid any furthe than I can throw him !
SECRETARY: With your bad knee , you bette not throw anybody , Ed . Rooney stares at her for a long beat .
ROONEY: What 's so dangerous about a characte like Ferris Bueller is that he gives the good kids bad ideas . The last thing I need at this point in my career is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples unning around these halls .
SECRETARY: He 's very popular , Ed . Sportos , motorheads , geeks , sluts , pinheads , dweebies , wonkers , ichies , they all adore him .
ROONEY: That 's exactly why I have to catch him this time . To show these kids that the example he sets is a first class ticket to nowhere .
SECRETARY: Ooo . You sounded like Dirty Harry just now . Rooney looks up at her with a proud smile .
ROONEY: Really ? He unconsciously does an Eastwood squint .
FERRIS: Cameron , if you 're not over here in fifteen minutes , you can find a new best friend . I 'm serious , man . This is bullshit , making me wait around the house for you .
CAMERON: I 'm sick . I feel like shit . Why ca n't you leave me alone ?
FERRIS' VOICE: You 're not up for some good times ? It 's a beautiful day . It 's almost summer . If this was Hawaii , we 'd be surfing .
FERRIS: You want to stay home and try to have the shits ? Try to barf ? Try to feel worse ?
CAMERON'S VOICE: I do n't have to try .
FERRIS: Be a man . Take some Pepto Bismol and get dressed . You 're boring me with this stuff . The other phone line rings .
TOM'S VOICE: Ferris ?
TOM: You sound miserable .
FERRIS' VOICE: Really ? Darn ! I thought I was improving .
TOM: Were you sleeping ?
FERRIS' VOICE: I was trying to do some homework .
FERRIS: Dad ? Can you hold on a second ?
TOM'S VOICE: Sure , pal . Are you alright ?
FERRIS: Just a little phlegm on the phone . Hold on . He puts his father on hold .
CAMERON'S VOICE: Oh , that 's just great . Are you busted ?
FERRIS: It 's completely cool . He 's just checking up on me . Now , listen to me . I 'm working on getting some heavy bucks out of him . So , the least you can do is hurry up and get over here . Bye .
TOM'S VOICE: Hey , pal , what was I supposed to do ?
FERRIS: Give yourself some credit , Dad . It was a mammoth gesture . It 's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas . It was that kind of concern .
TOM'S VOICE: Not any harder than anybody else . Ferris mouths Tom 's words as he says them .
FERRIS: You work so hard I 'll bet you do n't even remember where those bonds are , ight ?
TOM'S VOICE: Wrong . He nods .
FERRIS: Oh , yeah ? You 're pulling my leg . You 're just trying to cheer me up .
TOM'S VOICE: Like hell I am . They 're in a shoebox in my closet .
FERRIS: Was that a class move or what ? The guy gave it up faster than a drunk Catholic girl . I hope my kids do n't pull this shit on me . Of course , if they did n't , they 'd e dumb and abnormal and they 'd probably never move out of my house and I 'd have to support them until I die . I take it back . Dad ? All this talking has made me kind of light-headed . I think I better lie down .
TOM'S VOICE: Okay , pal . You take care . I 'll call you after lunch .
FERRIS: You do n't have to , Dad .
TOM'S VOICE: I want to . Bye now . He hangs up . Ferris sighs .
FERRIS: You win some , you lose some . He turns his desk chair around and gets up .
CAMERON: We 're gon na get caught . No doubt about it . He cuts the engine .
FERRIS: Cameron 'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes . The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision . The reason he does n't fell good is , he worries about everything . He 's the only guy I know who 's deeply concerned that when he grows up there 'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals . He exits the room .
TEACHER: Roosevelt 's health had seriously deteriorated by the time he met with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta . Pardon me .
NURSE: Sloane Peterson ?
NURSE: Dead grandmother .
ROONEY: Dead grandmother ?
SECRETARY: That 's what Mr. Peterson said . I had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane .
ROONEY: Who 's this girl 's going with ?
SECRETARY: It 's so hard to tell . I see he alot with Ferris Bueller . Rooney smiles . His suspicions are confirmed .
ROONEY: Could you get me Mr. Peterson 's daytime number ?
SECRETARY: Edward Rooney 's office . Yes . Can you hold ? Thank you . She puts the call on hold .
ROONEY: Ed Rooney .
MAN'S VOICE: Ed ? This is George Peterson .
ROONEY: How are you today , sir ?
MAN'S VOICE: We 've had a bit of bad luck this morning as you may have heard .
ROONEY: I heard . And , gosh , I 'm all broken up . Huh ? Oh , sure . I 'd be happy to elease Sloane . You produce a corpse and I 'll release Sloane . I want to see this dead grandmother firsthand .
SECRETARY: Ed Rooney 's office . Her jaw drops .
ROONEY: I 'll tell you want , you do n't like my policies , you can just come on down and smooch by big old ugly ass . You hear me ?
SECRETARY: Ferris Bueller 's on line two .
FERRIS: Mr. Rooney ? I 'm sorry to distu you at work but I was wondering if it would be possible for my siste to bring home any assignments from my classes that I may need .
FERRIS' VOICE: Thank you , sir . He nods .
CAMERON: You oughta be sorry for Christ 's sake ! A family member dies and you insult me . What 's the matte with you , anyway ?
ROONEY: I do n't know . I thought you were someone else . You have to know , sir , that I would never deliberately insult you . I ca n't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am .
CAMERON'S VOICE: Pardon my French but you 're an asshole ! Rooney nods enthusiastically .
ROONEY: Absolutely ! I most certainly am .
CAMERON: This is n't over yet , buster . You just make sure my daughter 's out in front of the school in ten minutes . Do you read me ?
ROONEY'S VOICE: Load and clear , Mr. Peterson .
CAMERON: Call me sir , goddamn it !
ROONEY'S VOICE: Sir .
CAMERON: That 's better .
FERRIS: Impossible . You 're doing great . Cameron sighs and goes back to the phone .
CAMERON: I do n't have all day to bark at you so I 'll make this short and sweet .
FERRIS: Great ! Cameron smiles proudly .
CAMERON: I want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes . By herself . I don 's want anyone around
FERRIS: Out in front my herself ? It 's too suspicious ! He 'll think something 's up , moron . Cover it .
CAMERON: You do it ! Ferris waves his arms angrily .
FERRIS: Talk !
CAMERON: I changed my mind , fella . You be out in front with her ! I wan na have a few words with you !
CAMERON'S VOICE: On second thought , I do n't have time to talk to you . We 'll get together soon and have lunch . We HEAR A SLAP AND THE CALL DISCONNECTS .
CAMERON: Why 'd you hit me ? !
FERRIS: Where 's your brain ? !
CAMERON: Why 'd you hit me ? !
FERRIS: Where 's your brain ? !
CAMERON: Why 'd you hit me ?
FERRIS: Where 's your brain ?
CAMERON: I asked you first .
FERRIS: How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney 's going to be there with her ? !
CAMERON: I said for her to be there alone and you freaked !
FERRIS: My , God , you 're so stupid ! I did n't hit you , I lightly slapped you .
CAMERON: You hit me . Look , do n't ask me to participate in your crap if you do n't like the way I do it !
FERRIS: I did n't deliberately hurt your feelings .
CAMERON: Oh , really ?
FERRIS: Yeah , really . Cameron glares at Ferris .
CAMERON: Hey , Ferris ? Have a nice life .
FERRIS: Cameron ?
CAMERON: Stick it up your ass , Ferris .
FERRIS: Cameron , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to jam you . It was uncalled for . Cameron stops .
CAMERON: You 're serious ? He turns around .
FERRIS: Dead serious .
CAMERON: Thanks .
FERRIS: You did screw up through , right ? Not that is was necessarily all you fault . Right ?
CAMERON: Why ?
FERRIS: To fix this situation , I 'm going to have to ask you for a small favor . Cameron 's jaw drops .
CAMERON: 1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California . Less than a hundred were made . It has a market value of $ 265,000 . My fathe spent three years restoring it . It is joy , it is his love , it is his passion .
FERRIS: It is his fault he did n't lock the garage .
CAMERON: Ferris , my father loves this car more than life itself . We ca n't take is out .
FERRIS: A man with priorities so far out of whack does n't deserve such a fine automobile .
CAMERON: He never drives it , Ferris . He just ubs it with a diaper .
FERRIS: We ca n't pick up Sloane in your car , Cameron . Rooney 'd never believe Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit .
CAMERON: It 's not a piece of shit .
FERRIS: It 's a piece of shit . Do n't worry about it . I do n't even have a piece of shit . I have to envy yours . Look , I 'm sorry but there 's nothing else we can do .
CAMERON: He knows the mileage , Ferris . He has it tatooed on his wrist .
FERRIS: He does n't trust you ?
CAMERON: No .
FERRIS: Alright , look , this is real simple . He puts his arm around Cameron .
CAMERON: How ?
FERRIS: We 'll drive home backwards . Cameron shakes his head , no .
CAMERON: Forget it . I 'm putting my foot down , Ferris . You 'll have to think of something else
CAMERON'S VOICE: You 're not talking me into this one . I have to live with the man . I 'm sorry but
CAMERON: Are you crazy ? ! Put the top back up !
FERRIS: This is perfect top-down weather .
CAMERON: What about Rooney ?
FERRIS: Cameron , the more obvious we are , the less likely we are to get caught .
CAMERON: That makes no sense whatsoever .
FERRIS: The adult mind is a suspicious machine . Stay down , man . Cameron squeezes himself lower .
CAMERON: Howcome it 's my Dad 's car and I 'm taking all the risk and I have to ride back here ?
FERRIS: I do n't have an explanation .
ROONEY: Once again let me say how deeply saddened I am by your loss .
SLOANE: Huh ?
ROONEY: Were you close to your grandmother ?
SLOANE: Oh . Um . Yeah . Very . She was a terrific lady . Very hip . Very old . Yeah .
DEEP VOICE: Oh , Sloane ! Dear !
FERRIS: Hurry along now !
SLOANE: I guess that 's my Dad . Thanks . See ya .
CAMERON: Hi . No .
SLOANE: What a fabulous car !
CAMERON: Enjoy it quick . It ' s going home .
FERRIS: It was risky , it was bold but it was totally necessary .
SLOANE: What 're we gon na do ?
FERRIS: The question is n't `` what are we gon na do '' , the question is `` what are n't we going to do . ''
CAMERON: Do n't tell me we 're not going to take the car home . Please .
FERRIS: If you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away ? Would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friend 's tension ? He smiles .
TELLER: Ferris Bueller ?
TELLER: Is Top a Slavic name ?
CAMERON: Yeah .
FERRIS: I 'd like to cash these in , please . We 're having a baby and we need the cash for a crib , clothes , diapers , food pellets , leash , water dish
TELLER: A baby ! You must be so excited . Cameron groans and turns away from the sham .
SLOANE: I 'm thrilled , ma'am . I 'm especially looking forward to wearing those jeans with the stretch panel in front . Mrs. Froeling thumbs through the bonds .
TELLER: Are you hoping for a boy o a girl ?
SLOANE: Actually , we 're hoping for a car .
CAMERON: Shit
TELLER: These bonds are n't mature . If you hold onto them another two years you 'll get an additional four dollars
FERRIS: I 'm aware of that .
TELLER: You 're throwing away four dollars .
FERRIS: No , ma'am , I 'm giving it to the government . They need it . Do you know what an aircraft carrier 's going for these days ?
JOYCE: Mrs. Froeling , how are you ?
MRS. FROELING: I passed a kidney stone Tuesday . Say , you must be very proud . Joyce does n't know what she 's talking about .
JOYCE: My son 's home sick today . If you would n't mind , on our way ack to the office , I 'd like to just run in and check up on him .
MOTHER: Of course .
SECRETARY: This is the Peterson 's home . She hands the phone to Rooney .
ROONEY: Ferris Bueller 's behind this . There 's no doubt in my mind . That 's what I was
SECRETARY: And her grandmother , too .
SLOANE: We ca n't come to the phone right now . We 've had a death in the family . If you need to reach us we 'll be at the following number
CAMERON'S VOICE: You have reached the Coughlin Bros. Mortuary . We are unable to come to the phone right now but if you 'll leave your name and number
ROONEY: Something 's going on , goddamn it .
SECRETARY: There 's a railroad strike .
ROONEY: And I 'm going to stop it !
SECRETARY: My brother-in-law 'll appreciate it . Rooney looks at her , puzzled .
ROONEY: What ?
SECRETARY: My brother-in-law rides the train to work . Rooney stares at her like she 's crazy .
ROONEY: Who gives a good goddamn ?
KID: Yo . We 're collecting money to uy Ferris Bueller a new kidney .
JEANIE: Go piss up a flagpole !
KID: Huh ?
CAMERON: We ca n't leave the car here !
FERRIS: Why not ?
CAMERON: Because we ca n't ! I want it back home where it belongs !
SLOANE: What could happen to it ?
CAMERON: It could get stolen , wrecked , scratched , you name it .
FERRIS: I 'll give the guy a five to watch it .
CAMERON: What guy ?
FERRIS: You speak English ?
ATTENDANT: Since I was three .
FERRIS: Great . I want to you take extra special care of this vehicle , okay ? He pats the Attendant on the arm . He smiles .
ATTENDANT: Like it 's a beautiful woman .
FERRIS: I appreciate it .
CAMERON: Yeah , sure . Whip it with a stick and piss on the hood .
SLOANE: Oh , please , Cameron . Do you have to e so graphic ? She heads down the street .
CAMERON: I do n't feel good , Ferris . Are we gon na stay long ?
FERRIS: Take a step back
SLOANE: Oh , shit !
SLOANE: What if the glass gives ?
FERRIS: Death .
SLOANE: Cool .
CAMERON: I think I see my Dad .
CAMERON'S FATHER: I think I see my car .
SLOANE: Do you love me ?
FERRIS: Do you love me ?
SLOANE: I asked you first .
FERRIS: Yes . You ?
SLOANE: Yes .
FERRIS: Would I trash a day of education to e with you if I did n't love you ?
SLOANE: Yes .
FERRIS: Would I risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if I did n't love you ?
SLOANE: Yes .
FERRIS: Would I have introduced you as my wife if I did n't love you ?
SLOANE: Wait a minute . That was a lie .
FERRIS: True . Ferris puts his arm around Sloane .
SLOANE: Sure .
FERRIS: Today ? Sloane stares at him . Is he serious .
SLOANE: No way !
FERRIS: I 'll do it , if you will . Cameron suddenly adds his two cents .
CAMERON: You need a blood test . Ferris looks around at him .
FERRIS: Huh ?
CAMERON: If your blood 's not compatible , you could produce a pinhead . The state requires a blood test .
FERRIS: So ?
CAMERON: So , you ca n't get married today .
FERRIS: Tomorrow ?
CAMERON: If you get a blood test today .
SLOANE: I 'm not getting married .
CAMERON: I 'm with you , babe .
FERRIS: Why not ?
SLOANE: What do you mean , why not ? Think about it .
FERRIS: Besides being too young and you father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheer- leader with a husband , give me a good reason why not .
CAMERON: I 'll give you two . My mother and father . Ferris and Sloane look at him curiously .
FERRIS: You 're father 's a toad and you Mom 's always wired out , but so what ? They 're old . That 's natural .
CAMERON: It makes me puke . Seeing people treat each other like that . It 's like the car . He loves the car . He hates his wife .
SLOANE: My parents are divorced . So what ? It 's not like it does n't happen ten thousand times a day .
CAMERON: Just because it happens does n't make it right . Are you comfortable with it ?
SLOANE: No . It 's not something I can get comfortable with . I 've tried . Are yours divorced ?
CAMERON: They may as well be .
SLOANE: Do you think they 're staying togethe ecause of you ? Cameron has n't seen it that way . He shrugs .
CAMERON: Yeah . Sure .
SLOANE: Consider thismy father canned me and my brother and my Mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits . He dropped us like a rock . Everything was cool at our house . I thought so . We all thought so . Then BLAM ! It 's over .
FERRIS: This is all news to me . She keeps a pretty good secret .
SLOANE: It was pure selfishness . When I have a kid , I do n't care how much I want something , if it 's gon na screw-up the kid , forget it .
FERRIS: She 's not lying .
CAMERON: You could change .
SLOANE: Yeah . But I 'm gon na try not to . I 'm gon na think about it . I 'm gon na try to prevent it .
FERRIS: This is optomism . It 's a common trait with my age group . Adults think it 's cute , it 's like a charming quick that infests youth . But it 's a cool thing and I think , deep down , crusty old shits wish they had some . They wish they had her , too . Sorry . She 's taken .
CAMERON: I 'd rather not have my family break apart , thank you .
SLOANE: Well , you know what ? It ai n't up to you . It 's out of your hands .
CAMERON: So , I in other words , I should just sit back and watch it crumble ?
SLOANE: You 're merely an inhabitant in thei universe .
FERRIS: Frightening choice of words .
SLOANE: They call the shots . When you split from them , you call the shots .
CAMERON: So , you 're saying I should run away ?
FERRIS: No . She 's saying it 's time for lunch .
SLOANE: What ?
FERRIS: Let 's go feed Cameron .
ANNOUNCER: Commodity prices rose sharply today in unusually heavy trading
MAITRE'D: May I help you ?
FERRIS: Yes . I 'm Abe Frohman . Party of three for 12 00 . The maitre 'd looks at Ferris curiously .
MAITRE'D: You 're Abe Frohman ?
FERRIS: I 'm Abe Frohman .
MAITRE'D: I 'm sorry , son . I 'm very busy right now . If you have trouble finding the door Sloane tugs Ferris ' sleeve . He ignores her .
FERRIS: Are you suggesting that I 'm not who I say I am ?
MAITRE'D: Shall I call the police ?
CAMERON: Let 's goAbe .
FERRIS: I 'm not going anywhere . Call the police . Go ahead . Bette yet I 'll call myself .
FERRIS: You touch me and I yell `` rat ! '' There 's another phone around here . Find it . The maitre 'd backs off .
CAMERON: Ferris , let 's split , please ?
SLOANE: Cameron 's right . We 're gon na get busted .
FERRIS: Not a chance in the world . He hands the phone to Sloane .
MAITRE'D: I appreciate your understanding .
FERRIS: Do n't grovel , Charles . Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten .
MAITRE'D: Enjoy your luncheon .
FERRIS: Thank you .
SLOANE: Oh , but I had a wonderful teacher .
FERRIS: Cameron , dear friend ? Cameron looks to Ferris .
JEANIE: I 'm gon na bust his buns .
FRIEND: Why ? What 's the point ?
JEANIE: Why ? Because I 'm sick of the little dope . He manipulates my parents , he does whatever he wants , whenever he wants and he never gets nailed . Well , babe , today I 'm the hammer .
FRIEND: I think he 's cute .
JEANIE: Sweetie , it 's an established fact that you have no taste . Ferris is not cute . He 's not charming . He 's not nice . He 's not a wonderful person . He 's an ignorant mule and the sooner everybody in this school comes to that realization the etter off we 'll all be . She displays the velcro straps to her friend .
FRIEND: Everybody thinks you 're an asshole .
JEANIE: Excuse me ?
FRIEND: I do n't think you 're an asshole .
JEANIE: Who does ? Her friend smiles sheepishly .
FRIEND: I do n't know . Just forget it .
JEANIE: Forget that everybody thinks I 'm an asshole ? Would you like everybody to think you 're an asshole ?
FRIEND: Not everybody thinks you 're an asshole . Mr. Rooney likes you .
JEANIE: Oh , hey . That 's exciting . A fat fifty year old clod with B.O . likes me . Jeanie shakes her head in disbelief .
FRIEND: Maybe if you did n't cat like and asshole
JEANIE: Am I acting like an asshole ?
FRIEND: I did n't mean it that way .
JEANIE: I this a conspiracy to shit all over me or something ? Is my brothe ehind this ? Tell me if he is or I 'll sock your tits .
FRIEND: You really do have a problem , Jeanie .
JEANIE: Me ? I have a problem ?
FRIEND: Somebody who threatens to sock people 's tits has a problem .
JEANIE: Alright . How about if I sock you face ? Jeanie 's friend gets up .
FRIEND: Take a walk , Jeanie . Her friend exits .
JEANIE: If it means anything to you , I have my period ! MY BODY 'S RIDDING
FERRIS: She 's a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured . He ody is a transport vehicle for he anger . I do n't know where she gets this shit . Basically , the family 's pretty cool . He looks down at the urinal .
CAMERON: What is it ?
SLOANE: I do n't know . But it looks like it 's already been eaten and digested .
CAMERON: I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us .
FERRIS: What are you doing ? Cameron looks at Ferris .
CAMERON: What is this shit ?
FERRIS: You got me . I do n't speak French .
CAMERON: Really ?
FERRIS: Superb .
WAITER: Sweetbreads .
FERRIS: Uh , huh . And what might that be ?
WAITER: Pancreas .
FERRIS: As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism ?
FERRIS: That secretes a thick , colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes ? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans ?
FERRIS: Check , please !
CAMERON: We 're gon na get nabbed , for sure .
FERRIS: No way , Cameron . Only the meek get nabbed . The bold survive . Let 's go .
SLOANE: I wonder if he has a name ?
FERRIS: Ninth Month .
SLOANE: My step-father 's always going off about how when he was young he was committed to all these causes .
FERRIS: He 's full of shit . All the old hippies are full of shit .
SLOANE: He says I do n't care about things like he did .
FERRIS: What 's he care about now ?
SLOANE: Baldness , fatty meats and money .
FERRIS: I rest my case .
CAMERON: What 's spooky is they still control everything . They took over when they were young and they never gave it up .
FERRIS: One of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits . It 's chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past .
CAMERON: It 's human nature to like what you had etter than what you have .
SLOANE: Agreed .
SLOANE, CAMERON: The Sears Tower .
CAMERON: You know , this is all very interesting ut I 'm starving .
FERRIS: An hour ago you wanted to yack .

His cavalie attitude will get him into trouble later in lifeand it 'll continue to piss me off and I 'll get so wadded-up that it 'll cause cervex cance and he 'll ruin my life . Screw him . She slips into the Dean 's outer office .

JEANIE: I seriously doubt it . When 's he back ?
SECRETARY: I do n't know . He left the grounds on personal business .
ROONEY: What 's the score ?
FERRIS: I think I broke my thumb .
SLOANE: Can we leave now ?
FERRIS: You want to leave ? We just got here .
SLOANE: You got a call , you broke your thumb , what 's left to do ?
FERRIS: Do you realize that if I played by the rules , right now I 'd be in gym ?
JEANIE: I ca n't believe my brother 's making me put myself in a position where I could get expelled . Selfish little moron . Ferris ? You 're overshadowed me long enough . I 'm gon na get you , buddy .
SLOANE: I love him .
CAMERON: It 's hard not to .
SLOANE: Do you believe in reincarnation ?
CAMERON: Huh ?
SLOANE: Do you believe that you lived before ?
CAMERON: Yeah . Sort of .
SLOANE: DO you ever wonder what you were ?
CAMERON: I do n't have to wonder . I know . Sloane looks at him with amazement .
FERRIS: Guten tag , dude !
CAMERON: What were you in a previous life ?
SLOANE: I 'm not sure but I think I know who Ferris was .
CAMERON: Hannibal .
SLOANE: From the A-Team ?
CAMERON: No . The guy who rode the elephants into Switzerland .
SLOANE: I think if he was anybody , he was Magellan . You know , the guy who went around the world . Cameron nods .
CAMERON: Yeah . As long as I 've known him , everything works for him . There 's nothing he ca n't handle . I ca n't handle anything . School , parents , the future . Ferris can do anything .
GIRLS: SHAKE IT UP , BABY
FERRIS: TWIST AND SHOUT !
GIRLS: TWIST AND SHOUT !
GIRLS: WORK IT ON OUT !
SLOANE: The future 's worse for a boy , is n't it ? Cameron does n't understand what she means .
CAMERON: That 's a pretty grim thought .
SLOANE: True , but it 's an option . No options is worse .
CAMERON: I do n't know what I 'm gon na do .
SLOANE: College .
CAMERON: Yeah , but to do what ?
SLOANE: What are you interested in ?
CAMERON: Nothing .
SLOANE: Me either .
CAMERON: What do you think Ferris is gon na do ?
POLICE OFFICER: YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO GOOD !
PUNKS: LOOK SO GOOD !
WOMAN: YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO FINE !
TODDLERS: LOOK SO FINE !
NEWSPAPER SELLER: TWIST A LITTLE CLOSER !
STREET CLEANERS: KNOW THAT YOU 'RE MINE !

VETERANS: AH !
FERRIS: AH !
PARADE: AHHHHH !
FERRIS: Who is it ? Rooney presses the intercom .
ROONEY: This is Ed Rooney , Ferris . I 'd like to have a word with you .
FERRIS' VOICE: I 'm sorry I ca n't come to the doo ight now . I 'm very ill and I 'm afraid that in my weakened condition , I could take a nasty spill down the stairs and subject myself to furthe school absenses .
ROONEY: B.S . Come down here .
FERRIS' VOICE: You can reach my parents at thei places of business . Thank you fo stopping by . I appreciate your concern for my well-being . It will be remembered long after this illness has past .
ROONEY: I 'm not leaving until you come down and talk to me .
FERRIS' VOICE: Have a nice day . Rooney presses the intercom .
ROONEY: I 'm not leaving , Ferris .
FERRIS' VOICE: Who is it ?
ROONEY: Do n't get smart with me Ferris !
FERRIS' VOICE: I 'm sorry I ca n't come to the doo ight now . I 'm very ill and I 'm afraid that in my weakened condition
FERRIS: Have a nice day .
CAMERON: How does she do that ? One goes one way , one goes the other .
FERRIS: She 's probably schizophrenic .
SLOANE: Ferris , this is nauseating me . Really . I 'm losing respect fo you by the bucket .
FERRIS: You do n't think it 's amazing that we got in ?
SLOANE: Who wants to get in ?
FERRIS: Cameron looks like a toddler , fo Christ 's sake . I 'm talking about a major achievement in false identification .
SLOANE: I 'm not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands .
FERRIS: Point well taken . But consider why she does it . Why she does it and you do n't .
SLOANE: I 'm not a tramp .
FERRIS: Maybe her life fell apart . Maybe she lost somebody . A lover . A boyfriend . A parent . A child This kind of thing makes me a little depressed . You may think because I 'm the age I am that I 'm a sex maniac . That sex is all I think about . But that 's not true . I 'm a romantic . I think alot of people my age are . We think about love and matters of the heart . And SAT scores and acne aside , we worry about lonliness . It 's a terrible thing . And we feel it . I feel it .
ATTENDANT: You looking for something in my car ?
CAMERON'S FATHER: No .
JEANIE: I 'm gon na microwave his nuts
FERRIS: So
DRIVER: One year .
FERRIS: What 's your overall impression ?
DRIVER: It 's very good here .
FERRIS: Better than Russia ?
DRIVER: Much better here than in Russia .
FERRIS: Clearly you 've never been to an American high school .
CAMERON: It 's getting late , Ferris . I have to get the car home . I know you do n't care , but it means my ass .
FERRIS: You think I do n't care ?
CAMERON: I know you do n't care .
FERRIS: That hurts , Cameron .
SLOANE: Jump back , Ferris , Cameron 's been a good sport .
FERRIS: Cameron , what 'd you see today ? Cameron looks at him .
FERRIS: What 's he doing ?
SLOANE: He 's looking at me and he 's licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands .
FERRIS: What ? ! Sloane bursts out laughing .
SLOANE: Roast !
ROONEY: That 's a $ 28.00 dress shoe , you worthless mutt !
CAMERON: Moneytitsplease
DELIVERY MAN: Howdy !
FERRIS' VOICE: Who is it ? The Deliver Man presses the intercom .
DELIVERY MAN: Focus on Flowers . I have a delivery .
FERRIS' VOICE: I 'm sorry but I ca n't come to the door right now . I 'm very ill and I 'm afraid
DELIVERY MAN: As I heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney .
FERRIS' VOICE: Have a nice day .
DELIVERY MAN: Thank you . I do n't know the details . But my oss had to send to Milwaukee to get more orchids . He 's very popular . Rooney is flabbergasted .
ROONEY: No .
DELIVERY MAN: You gon na be around for awhile ?
ROONEY: I imagine so .
DELIVERY MAN: You wan na keep an eye on these ?
ROONEY: Oh , Christ
FERRIS: Bueller . Ferris Bueller .
FERRIS' VOICE: I 'm the first Chicago area youth to be selected to participate in a space shuttle mission .
FERRIS: I was going to say I knew Springsteen 's home phone number and I was going to give out the number of the New Jersey State Police but I thought I might get busted . After I got flunked in driver 's ed for sideswiping a mail ox , which was not in any way , shape or from my fault . I was putting out a cigarette , like I was told . It was weird . I 'm so used to getting in a car and lighting up , because I 'm not allowed to smoke at home , that I got in the driver 's ed . car and spaced completely , pulled out of the lot , lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Helle looked at me like I 'd just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and I realized what the hell I was doing and I went to put it out and hit the mail box . Anyway , I was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that I considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone sex and I was gon na use Mrs. Heller 's home number but is cost too much . I took it again and passed . But I had to work at Burger King to get the cash to pay for the driver 's ed . car . The car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and I think Rooney pocketed the cash . But I ca n't prove it ? I 'm in high school , remember ? He turns back to the DJ .
ROONEY: Sleep tight , pooch .
JEANIE: I knew it !
FERRIS' VOICE: My input on the Star Wars defense plan was pretty substantial so I guess this is their way of rewarding me . I 'm pretty flattered .
D.J. VOICE: Can you stay around and take a few phone calls ?
FERRIS' VOICE: I 'd really like to but I have a kidney operation in about an hour .
JOYCE: If you 're willing to commit a little time and a little money to this place , you can really have something to be proud of . Do n't let the black living room throw you off . She opens the car door .
D.J. VOICE: I wish you the best of luck .
FERRIS' VOICE: Thanks , Steve .
D.J. VOICE: A very interesting guy , Ferris Bueller .
JOYCE: Well , Boyd , how are you bearing up ? The kid stares at her .
BOYD: Twice .
JOYCE: His name is Ferris . I think you 'd like him .
BOYD: Is he going up in the space shuttle in September ?
JOYCE: Not that I know of .
BOYD: I knew he was bullshitting .
MOTHER: Watch your mouth .
BOYD: How do you watch your mouth ?
JOYCE: Do you know my son ?
FATHER: Do n't pay any attention to him . He thinks it 's cute to bait adults .
BOYD: I do n't think it 's cute . I think it 's fun .
JEANIE: This is not a phoeny phone call . There 's an intruder , male caucasian , possibly armed , certainly weird , in our kitchen . My name is Bueller . There 's another pause . Jeanie 's face drops .
JEANIE'S VOICE: Excuse me . If whoever 's in the house is still in the house , I 'd like you to know that I have just called the police . If you have any brains whatsoever , you 'll get your ass out of my house real quick . Rooney stiffens with fear .
FERRIS: Just out of curiosity , what was your top speed coming down the amp ?
BLACK GUY: About 60 .
FERRIS: Stunning !
SLOANE: What 's next .
CAMERON: Nothing . We return the car .
SLOANE: We could go to my house . My parents are n't coming home until late .
FERRIS: We have enough cash left for a quick flight to Peoria and back .
CAMERON: Very funny .
FERRIS: Cameron ? How many miles did you say this thing had when we left ?
CAMERON: One hundred and twenty six and halfway between three and fou tenths . Why ? How many miles are on it now ? He glances down at the speedometer .
FERRIS: Here 's where Cameron goes berserk .
SLOANE: You okay ?
FERRIS: Hey , Cameron . It 's okay . We 'll fix it .
SLOANE: Cameron ! Cut it out ! What 's wrong ? ! Ferris !
FERRIS: Cameron , are you okay ? It 's no problem , really . Your old man wo n't know a thing . It 's completely fixable .
SLOANE: Shut-up ! It is a problem ! Fo him it 's a problem . Nothing 's a problem for you . But it 's a problem for him ! So , just shut-up . She turns back to Cameron .
FERRIS VOICE: Who is it ? We hear a MALE VOICE over the intercom .
VOICE: Anybody home ?
FERRIS' VOICE: I 'm sorry that I ca n't come to the door right now
JEANIE: I 'm saved ! Thank you , God ! Thank you , thank you , thank you !
KID: Hey , Mr. Rooney ! What 're you doing ? Rooney does n't respond .
ANOTHER KID: Did you get in a fight ?
DRIVER: You want a lift ?
GIRL: I 'll bet you never smelled a eal school bus before .
GIRL: Gummi Bear ?
GIRL: They 've been in pocket . They 're eal soft and warm .
FRESHMAN BOY: It 's kind of like being in the elly of the beast is n't it ?
FERRIS: This may very well be for real . I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two . He 's always been a little keyed-up . All I wanted to do was give him a good day . We 're gon na graduate in a couple of months . Then we have the summer . He 'll work and I 'll work . And we 'll see each other at night and on the weekends ut then he 'll go to one school and I 'll go to another . And basically that 'll e it . As much as we like each other , the process of growing up will separate us . He begins to walk . We follow him .
SLOANE: Ferris ?
FERRIS: I 'm being tested here . He starts back to the picnic table .
FERRIS: You feeling any better , Cameron ?
SLOANE: The water 's really nice . I wish you 'd come in .
CAMERON: Surgeryfiremove
FERRIS: Cameron ? Do you think this because of the car or is it a combination of everything shitty in your life ?
CAMERON: Musickissattack
FERRIS: You just ca n't deal with anymore shit ? The car took you into the ed zone ? Time for a reality check ?
SLOANE: Cameron ? I could flip real easy , too . There 's nothing wrong with it . At one time or another , everybody goes to the zoo .
FERRIS: Maybe he was actually sick . Maybe he was n't bullshitting himself .
CAMERON: GesundheitGodmercy
FERRIS: CAMERON !
SLOANE: What ?
FERRIS: You asshole ! Cameron 's smiling .
SLOANE: What ?
BOY: Drugs ?
JEANIE: No , thank you . I 'm straight .
BOY: I meant , are you here for drugs ? Jeanie stares at him .
JEANIE: Why are you here ?
BOY: Drugs .
JEANIE: I do n't know why I 'm here .
BOY: Then why do n't you go home ?
JEANIE: Why do n't you put your thum up your butt ? The boy stares at her .
BOY: You want to talk about your problem ?
JEANIE: With you ? Are you serious ?
BOY: Yeah , I 'm serious .
JEANIE: Blow yourself .
BOY: That 's cool . Did you shoot him o something ?
JEANIE: No , not yet . The boy nods . He understands the emotion .
BOY: What do you care if your brothe ditches school ? Jeanie stares at the boy .
JEANIE: Why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go ?
BOY: You could ditch .
JEANIE: I 'd get caught .
BOY: So , you 're pissed at him because he ditches and does n't get caught ?
JEANIE: Basically . The boy nods knowingly .
BOY: Then your problem is you .
JEANIE: Excuse me ?
BOY: Excuse you . You oughta spend a little more time dealing with yourself and a little less time worrying about what your brother does . It 's just an opinion .
JEANIE: If you say Ferris Bueller , you lose a testicle .
BOY: You know him ?
CAMERON: The whole time I was just thinking things over . I was like , meditating . I was thinking about the future . And I realized it does n't make and difference if the present goes to shit .
FERRIS: I have a agree with you there .
SLOANE: Really .
CAMERON: I 've been thinking all day that if you could only have the use of one word , what would it be ?
FERRIS: Sloane is naked before your eyes and you 're thinking about words ?
SLOANE: God bless you , Cameron .
CAMERON: Thank you , Sloane .
FERRIS: I ca n't believe you 'd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi ight in front of you .
SLOANE: Come on , Ferris , answer his question .
FERRIS: Bathroom .
SLOANE: I 'd say She thinks .
FERRIS: Cash .
CAMERON: It 's the only word you could ever use .
FERRIS: Hello .
SLOANE: Love .
FERRIS: And what is you loathe somebody ? Are you going to say `` love '' every time you see them ?
SLOANE: It 's better than `` hello '' .
FERRIS: Hellos ' generic .
SLOANE: You wan na be generic ?
CAMERON: It 's help .
CAMERON: Ferris ? It 's not working . Ferris looks up .
FERRIS: I thought that might be a problem . Let 's crack open the odometer and oll it back by hand . Cameron shakes his head .
CAMERON: I got a better idea . It 's cool . He walks back around behind the Ferrari .
FERRIS: This is a big U-2 fan .
FERRIS: What was that about ?
SLOANE: This has to be a dream .
FERRIS: Cameron ? One quick question . Why 'd you do that ?
SLOANE: Why ?
CAMERON: I took a stand .
FERRIS: No , Cameron . You wrecked a car .
CAMERON: It 's okay . Ferris looks across the street at the car .
FERRIS: I have an idea . If you 're interested . Cameron looks at him . He shakes his head .
CAMERON: I 'm gon na handle it .
FERRIS: I think this could work .
CAMERON: No , thanks . I want to deal with it by myself .
SLOANE: What about your one word ?
CAMERON: You already did it . If I need it again , I 'll use it . He smiles . He raises am impish eyebrow .
JOYCE: She 's never been in trouble before . This is a shock to me . First , I do n't know why she was n't at school . Second , I do n't know why she 'd call you with this story about a rapist .
OFFICER: For whatever reasons she did it , I think she 'd had a good scare .
JOYCE: I hope so . I appreciate your calling me . I can assure you that her fathe and I will have a long talk with her . The gathers her purse and jacket and stands .
OFFICER: Oh , by the way , I hope you son 's feeling better . Joyce looks at the officer curiously .
JEANIE: If you keep this to yourself , I think we can probably get it on pretty good .
BOY: For sure . Jeanie stands up .
JEANIE: Hi .
JOYCE: Do n't `` hi '' me , young lady . Get your stuff . Jeanie reaches down for her purse .
BOY: What 's your name ?
JEANIE: Jean . What 's yours ?
BOY: Garth Volbeck .
SLOANE: I had a great time today .
FERRIS: Yeah . It was pretty cool .
SLOANE: You think Cameron 's gon na be alright ?
FERRIS: Sure . He had to so it , I guess . His old man had it coming . He 'll e okay . I 'd be worried if he 'd taken my idea . Sloane smiles knowingly .
SLOANE: You did n't have an idea , did you ?
FERRIS: Not a glimmer .
SLOANE: You 're so smart .
FERRIS: No . I 'm just real loose . He kisses her .
SLOANE: I LOVE YOU !
ROONEY: Looking for this ?
FERRIS: Yes .
ROONEY: I got you , Ferris . This time I finally got you .
JEANIE: Thank God , you 're alright ! We 've een worried sick !
JEANIE: Thank you for bringing him home , Mr. Rooney . You better get up in bed tight now . Ferris limps into the house .
TODD: Ferris ? Does my head look like it 's getting bigger ?
FERRIS: No , but Kimberly 's is .
KIMBERLY: Is he serious ?
TODD: I think so .
KIMBERLY: Oh , shit !
FERRIS: Thanks , Jeanie .
JEANIE: No problem .
FERRIS: By the way , I borrowed some cash from you . I 'll pay you back .
JEANIE: You do n't have to .
FERRIS: I want to .
JEANIE: You do n't have to . I 've been ripping off your wallet for years . Ferris gives her a proud smile .
JOYCE: Hi , guys .
KIMBERLY: Is my head swelling up ?
JEANIE: I 'm sorry I 've been riding you uns for so long .
FERRIS: It 's completely cool .
JEANIE: Do you know a guy named Garth Volbeck ?
FERRIS: Vaguely .
JEANIE: Is he cool ?
FERRIS: He 's cool . But stay away from his other .
JOYCE: Honey ?
FERRIS: 150 % better , thank you .
TOM: Ferris . You 're sick . There 's no point pushing yourself and making it worse .
FERRIS: Maybe you 're right , Dad .
TOM: I know I 'm right . Joyce leans over and kisses him forehead .
JOYCE: How did you get so sweet ?
FERRIS: Years of practice .
FERRIS: Yeah , life is a carousel . A great big crazy ball of pure living , breathing joy and delight .
THE VOICE: 'If you build it , he will come . '
CALLS: Annie , what was that ?
CALLS BACK: What was what ?
RAY: That voice .
ANNIE: What voice ?
RAY: Just now . Like an announcement .
ANNIE: We did n't hear anything .
RAY: Oh .
THE VOICE: 'If you build it , he will come . '
RAY: Okay , you must 've heard that .
ANNIE: Sorry . Come on . Dinner . Annie leads Karin inside .
RAY: Was there like a sound truck on the highway , or something ?
ANNIE: Nape .
RAY: Kids with a radio ?
ANNIE: Nope . You really hearing voices ?
RAY: Just one .
ANNIE: Ah . God ?
RAY: More like a. . .ballpark announcer .
ANNIE: What 'd it say ?
RAY: 'If you build . it , he will come . '
ANNIE: If you build what , who will come ?
SHRUGS: He did n't say .
ANNIE: Ooh , I hate it when that happens .
RAY: Me too .
THE VOICE: 'If you build it , he will come . '
RAY: Build what ? For who ?
ANNIE: Ray ?
RAY: It 's okay , honey , I 'm just-talking to the cornfield .
KARIN: Why 'd you do that ? It was funny .
RAY: Trust me , Karin , it 's not funny . The man is sick . He 's very sick . Annie enters , putting on her coat .
ANNIE: Karin , if you 're finished , get your coat and school bag . Let 's go . Karin bolts from the table .
RAY: Uh honey , I 'll take her today . I ' v-e got some errands in town .
ANNIE: Far out .
ANNIE: What if the voice calls while you 're gone ?
RAY: Take a message .
ANNIE: Right .
DOCTOR: Well , I ca n't find anything wrong . I could recommend a shrink , but hey , people hear things all the time . I heard a voice once . I was still living with my parents , 'then . They worked in the circus , so I was raised in the circus , and I was training to be a clown . This one day , I 'm putting on my little red nose and I hear a voice , tells me to go to medical school . Here I am .
RAY: In all those years , did you ever
SEARCHES: I 've heard that sometimes farmers out in the fieldhear things . Voices .
QUICKLY: No . It 's just that I heard some farmers do , and I , of course , do n't , so I was wondering if I was doing something wrong , or something . Did you ever hea voices out there ?
CASHIER: ( calls from he
CASH REGISTER: Who 's hearing voices ?
RAY: No ! No , I 'm not . Really .
LAUGH: Well , I 'll just get some 3-in-1 oil , that should
THE VOICE: 'If you build it , he will come . '
RAY: All right , who are you , and what the hell do you want from me ? ! ? All he hears is a faraway echo .
THE VOICE: 'If you build it , he will come . '
RAY: If you build it
RAY: . he will come ' .
FLASH CUT: i5 THE MAN AND THE FIELD 1 5
RAY: .he will come .
ANNIE: Yo , Ray ! Food !
RAY: Annie
PLAYING ALONG: Ray
RAY: You 're not going to believe this
ANNIE: You heard the voice again .
RAY: Wait , this gets better , I just saw a vision .
ANNIE: Get out of here !
RAY: I swear to God . An actual vision .
ANNIE: We 're going to have to burn you at the stake if this keeps up .
RAY: I know .
ANNIE: Hey , you do n't suppose this could be like an acid flashback , do you ?
RAY: I never took acid .
ANNIE: Maybe you will someday , and it 's a flash forward .
RAY: Annie , there 's more .
ANNIE: You 're subscribing to the Enquirer .
RAY: I think I know what 'If you build it , he will come ' means .
ANNIE: Oooh , why do I not think this is a good thing ?
RAY: I think it means if I build a baseball field out there , Shoeless Joe Jackson will get to come back and play ball again .
ANNIE: You 're kidding .
RAY: Uh uh . She whistles . This is serious .
ANNIE: Boy , I thought my family was crazy , but thisthis is the craziest thing I 've ever heard .
RAY: I know . It 's totally nuts .
ANNIE: I mean , Shoeless Joe , he 's
NODS: Died in '51 .
ANNIE: And he 's the one they suspended , right ?
RAY: Far as I know .
ANNIE: You know what amazes me ? No one could ever get you to believe in astrology , or ESP , or reincarnation , or heaven , o any of that stuff . But thisI think this shows real personal growth , Ray .
RAY: Thank you .
ANNIE: Oh , sweetie . I hope you know that even though I make jokes , I 'm going to visit you every month wherever they put you . He offers her a weak smile and exits .
RAY: Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing ?
ANNIE: If I did , I 'd forgotten it . Ray sits up in the dark .
RAY: I always felt cheated I never got to see him play . He was supposed to be so graceful , and agile . So to actually get to see him play againto let him play again , to right an old wrong
ANNIE: Wait a minute , Bosco . Are you actually thinking of doing this ?
RAY: No .
THEN: I mean , I ca n't think of one good reason why I should , -but I 'm thirty-eight years old , I have a wife , a child , and a mortgage , and I 'm scared to death I 'm turning into my father .
ANNIE: What 's your father got to do with this ?
RAY: I never forgave him for getting old . By the time he'was as old as I am now , he was ancient . He must have had dreams , but he never did anything about them . For all I know , he may have even heard voices , too , but he sure did n't listen to them . The man never did one spontaneous thing in all the years I knew him . Annie , I 'm scared that that 's what growing up means . I 'm afraid of that happening to me . And something tells me this may be my last chance to do something about it . I want to build that field . Do you think I 'm crazy ? She looks at him with great understanding .
ANNIE: Yes .
RAY: Ty Cobb called him the greatest left fielder of all time . His glove was called 'the place where triples go to die . '
KARIN: I ca n't .
RAY: Twelve hits , including the series ' only home run . And they said he was trying to lose !
KARIN: It 's ridiculous .
CASHIER: That 's 855 dollars , sixty-four cents .
RAY: We 'd better notify Mars to send us more money .
EQUALLY DEADPAN: Remlak wo n't like that .
RAY: That 's his problem . And tell him to make it in Earth dollars this time .
KARIN: Then what happened ?
RAY: The Commissioner of Baseball suspended eight of the players including the great Shoeless Joe Jackson for life .
KARIN: What 's suspend ?
RAY: They never let him play the game again . They continue to work in silence .
RAY: What . What !
STORE OWNER: You 're the fella that plowed under you corn and built a baseball diamond , ight ?
RAY: Yeah . What about it ?
STORE OWNER: Greatest damn thing I ever heard . The other employees beam their agreement .
RAY: At these prices , I 'm not surprised .
RAY: Thank youthank you
RAY: My father said he saw him years late playing under a made-up name in some tenth-rate league in Carolina . He 'd put on fifty pounds , and the spring was gone from his step , but he could still hit . Dad used to say no one could hit like Shoeless Joe . Ray is smiling wistfully .
ANNIE: That 's the first time I 've ever seen you smile as you mentioned your father . Ray considers that .
KARIN: How come ?
ANNIE: Come on , you . Bed time .
RAY: Careful
RAY: I have just created something totally illogical .
ANNIE: That 's what I like about it .
RAY: Am I completely nuts ?
ANNIE: Not completely . She looks out over the baseball field .
RAY: It is kinda pretty , is n't it ?
ANNIE: Any sign ?
RAY: Something 's going to happen out there . I can feel it .
KARIN: Daddy , what 's a southpaw ?
RAY: A left-handed pitcher .
TO ANNIE: How bad is it ?
ANNIE: Well , given how much less acreage we have for corn , I 'd say we 'll probably .almost break even .
RAY: Jesus .
ANNIE: We 've spent all our savings on that field .
RAY: Just a minute , Karin .
TO ANNIE: So what are you saying ? We ca n't keep the field ?
SADLY: It makes it real hard to keep the farm , Ray . Ray closes his eyes .
RAY: In a minute , Karin .
ANNIE: We 'll put up some coffee . You go ahead .
RAY: How 's the field play ?
THE MAN: It 's good . The ball bounces true .
RAY: Hi .
THE MAN: Joe Jackson .
RAY: I bet its good to be playing again , huh ?
SHOELESS JOE: It was like having part of me amputated .
SHOELESS JOE: I 've heard that old man wake up and scratch itchy legs that 've been dust fo fifty years . That was me . I 'd wake up in the night with the smell of the allpark in my nose and the cool of the grass on my feet . The thrill of the grass He has found the bat he likes .
MODESTY: Yeah , I 'm not bad .
RAY: Do n't we need a catcher ?
SHOELESS JOE: Not if you can get it near the plate , we do n't .
RAY: I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson .
RAY: Yes , he can hit the curve .
SHOELESS JOE: Stick with fast balls , kid .
RAY: You bet .
SHOELESS JOE: Damn , this feels good . Put it right here , huh ?
RAY: Right , you were a low ball hitter .
SHOELESS JOE: Oh man , I did love this game . You know , I 'd have played for food money . it was the game , the sounds , the smells . You ever held a glove or a ball to you face ? Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound .
RAY: Yeah .
SHOELESS JOE: And it was riding the trains from town to town . And the hotels with brass spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds in the rooms . And it was the crowd getting to their feet when the ball was hit deep . Shoot , I 'd have played fo free .
RAY: My family .
SHOELESS JOE: What 's with the lights ?
RAY: `` All the stadiums have them now except Wrigley Field .
SHOELESS JOE: Makes it harder to see the ball .
RAY: The owners found that more people could attend night games .
SHAKES HEAD: Owners By now , Annie and Karin have joined them .
RAY: Mr. Jackson my wife Annie , my daughte Karin .
SHOELESS JOE: Joe . Ma 'm
SHAKES ANNIE'S: hand and winks
AT KARIN: Hi .
KARIN: Are you a ghost ?
RAY: Karin She 's just kidding .
SHOELESS JOE: It 's okay .
TO KARIN: What do you think ?
SHOELESS JOE: Then I guess I 'm real .
ANNIE: Would you like to come inside ' ?
SHOELESS JOE: Uh , thanks , butI do n't think I can .
RAY: Yeah . I built this for you .
SHOELESS JOE: There are others , you know . There were eight of us . It 'd sure mean a lot to them .
RAY: Oh man , anytime . They 're all welcome here .
SHOELESS JOE: Thank you , Ray . I appreciate it . See you later , huh ?
RAY: Yeah . See you later .
KARIN: Say it ai n't so , Joe !
ANNIE: Where 's he going ?
SMILING: Through that door in the fence .
ANNIE: Since when is there a door in the fence ?
MORE BROADLY: I do n't know . I did n't put one there .
SHOELESS JOE: Hey ! Is this heaven ?
RAY: No . It 's Iowa .
ANNIE: You bet your ass we are .
MARK: You 're going to lose your farm , pal .
RAY: Come on , it 's so big . How can you lose something so big ?
ANNIE: You misplaced the house once .
RAY: Yeah , but it turned up two days later , did n't it ?
MARK: Ray , this stupid baseball field is going to bankrupt you . Everybody knows it . All I 'm saying is if you wait till you default on your loan , you lose everything . Sell now , my partners 'll
RAY: Thanks , Mark , but no .
MARK: What are you holding on to this place for ? You 've never even liked Iowa . You do n't like farming , you do n't know the first thing about it -
RAY: Hey ; I know a lot more about farming than you think .
MARK: How could you plow under your majo crop ?
TO ANNIE: What 's a crop ? Karin enters breathlessly .
KARIN: Daddy , the baseball game is on .
RAY: Excuse us .
MARK: I do n't believe this guy . I 'm trying to bail him out and he goes off to watch television . Annie stifles a laugh .
MOTHER: Does he beat you ?
ANNIE: What ? ? ?
MARK: He 's drinking , right ?
ANNIE: He does n't drink , and he does n't beat me , okay ? Now I 'll grant you , he has gotten me to worship Satan with him , but just a little . Her mother gasps .
RAY: Watch Joe . Watch his feet as the pitcher gets the sign and starts to pitch . A good left fielder knows what pitch is coming , and he can tell from the.angle of the bat where the ball 's going to be hit .
HAPPY FELSCH: Showoff !
BUCK WEAVER: Aw , stick it in your ear , Felsch .
EDDIE CICOTTE: Yeah , if you 'd run like that against Detroit I'da won twenty games that year .
HAPPY FELSCH: Oh for Pete 's sake , that was sixty-five years ago ! Give it up , will ya
SWEDE RISBERG: Hey. , you guys wan na play ball , or what ?

PLAYERS: All right , 'Karin !
ANNIE: Ray ? Mom 's leaving .
RAY: Oh . Well , it wasyou know , thanks fo coming .
MARK: Think about what I said . I just want to help .
RAY: I know .
MARK: I thought you two were going to watch some game .
RAY: Oh , I guess it 's not really a game . It 's more like a practice .
MARK: Eight of what ? Ray points to the noisy players on the field .
RAY: Them .
MARK: Karin honey what are you watching ?
KARIN: The baseball men .
MARK: Do you see any baseball men right now ?
ANNOYED: Of course I do .
MOTHER: I do n't think it 's very polite to try to make other people feel stupid .
ANNIE: You do n't see it ?
DEE: That 's not funny , Annie . Her family leaves in a huff .
ANNIE: They could n't see it .
RAY: Interesting .
SWEDE RISBERG: Here , look at this . Sixty-five years since I worn this uniform , still fits me like a glove .
RAY: You must keep in pretty good shape .
NODS: I died in '75 . So I ai n't had a cigarette in , what , thirteen years . You do n't smoke , do you ?
RAY: No .
APPROACHING: Felt good out there today , huh , guys ?
BUCK WEAVER: Fuckin ' A !
PLAYERS: Weaver !
WEAVER: Oh shit . I mean , sorry . I 'm sorry . Annie calls from the house .
ANNIE: Ray ! Dinner !
FALSETTO: Raay ! Dinner !
SHOELESS JOE: Come on , fellas . Let 's hit the showers .
TO RAY: See you later , Ray .
RAY: Right . See you guys .
THE VOICE: 'Ease his pain . ' Ray stops short .
RAY: What ? No response .
RAY: I 'm sorry . I did n't understand .
THE VOICE: 'Ease his pain . ' Ray stops short .
RAY: What ? No response .
THE VOICE: 'Ease his pain . '
RAY: Whose pain ? What pain ? No response .
ANNIE: Come on , wash up . We 've got a PTA meeting after dinner . They 're talking about banning books again . Really subversive books like , Wizard of Oz , Diary of Anne Frank - She notices Ray is strangely silent .
PAY: The Voice is back .
ANNIE: Oh Lord , you do n't have to build a football field now , do you ?
RAY: He said'Ease his pain . '
ANNIE: Ease whose pain ?
RAY: I asked him . He would n't tell me .
ANNIE: Shoeless Joe 's ?
RAY: I do n't think so .
ANNIE: One of the other players ?
RAY: I do n't think so .
ANNIE: This is a very non-specific voice you 've got out there , Ray , and he 's really starting to piss me off . Ray nods as Annie serves the meal in silence .
MISS CORSER: Karin has such a wonderful imagination . Lately , she 's been making up these charming little stories about ghosts who play baseball in a cornfield wonderful imagination .
SMILE: Yes . She gets that from Ray .
RAY: Hmm ? Annie leads Ray inside .
IRATE MOTHER: .and I say smut and filth like this has no place in our schools !
ANNIE: Fascist . I 'd like to ease her pain . Ray is still lost in thought .
PRINCIPAL: Mrs. Perkins , the book you are waving about is hardly smut . It is considered y many critics as the classic novel about growing up in the 1960s .
ANNIE: I read it four times . Funniest book I ever read .
IRATE MOTHER: It 's pornography !
PRINCIPAL: The Supreme Court said its not . And its author , Mr. Mann -
ANGRY FATHER: is sick !
PRINCIPAL: Terence Mann is a Pulitzer prize-winner , and was widely regarded as the finest satirist of his time .
IRATE MOTHER: Well I think he 's a pervert , and quite probably a Communist , too !
TO RAY: What planet are these people from ?
NOTES: The se-called novels of Terence Mann endorse promiscuity , godlessness , the mongrelization of races , and disrespect to high-ranking officers of the United States Army . And that 's why right- thinking school boards all across the country have been banning this guy 's shit since 1969 .
TO HIMSELF: Terence Mann
IRATE MOTHER: You know why he stopped writing books ? Because he masturbates !
TO RAY: I ca n't take this anymore .
VERY REASONABLY: Excuse me , madam , but you 're speaking of something about which you do n't know squat . Terence Mann was a warm and gentle voice of.reason during a time of great madness . He coined the phrase 'Make Love , Not War . ' When others were chanting 'Burn , baby , burn , ' he was writing about love , and peace , and understanding . He helped define an era . And a generation . And he helped us laugh at ourselves . I cherished every one of his books , and I dearly wish he 'd write more . And if you had experienced even a little bit of the Sixties , you might feel the same way , too .
IRATE MOTHER: I experienced the sixties .
ANNIE: No . I think you had two Fifties , and moved right on to the Seventies .
IRATE MOTHER: Oh yeah ? Well your husband plowed unde his corn and built a baseball field ! The crowd `` oohs '' and `` aahs . ''
ANNIE: Now there 's an intelligent response .
IRATE MOTHER: The weirdo .
RAY: Annie
TO RAY: It 's okay , I 'll be cool . ( aloud , to the
PARENT: At least he 's not a book burner , you Nazi cow ! Now the crowd erupts .
IRATE PARENT: You 're both a bunch of weirdos !
ANNIE: All right Beulah , you wan na step outside ? ! ? Huh ?
ANNIE: All right . Now who 's for The Bill of Rights ? Come onwho thinks freedom 's a pretty good thing ? Let 's see those hands . Some people start raising their hands .
RISING: Annie , we got ta go .
ANNIE: We got ta go .
RAY: I figured it out .
RELIVING IT: 'Step outside , you Nazi cow . ' Ha-ha !
RAY: I know whose pain I 'm supposed to ease .
STOPPING SHORT: What ?
RAY: I know whose pain I 'm supposed to ease .
ANNIE: Ray , I just halted the spread of neo-facism in America , and you 're talking about -
RAY: Terence Mann .
ANNIE: What about him ?
RAY: That 's whose pain .
ANNIE: How do you know that ?
RAY: I do n't know . I just know . I was right about building the field , was n't I ?
ANNIE: What 's his pain ?
RAY: I do n't know .
ANNIE: Then how are you supposed to ease it ?
RAY: I do n't know .
ANNIE: Ray
RAY: Annie .
ANNIE: ( tries to put
THIS GENTLY: He 's my favorite writer too , utwhat 's Terence Mann got to do with aseball ?
RAY: By the early Seventies , the guy decides people have become either too extremist or too apathetic to listen to him . So he stops writing books . He starts writing poetry . About whales and stuff . Then , he starts fooling around with a home computer , and gets hooked . Know what he does now ? Annie shakes her head no .
ANNIE: Right . So what 's it got to do with aseball ?
RAY: In the April 1962 issue of Jet Magazine , there 's a story of his called 'This Is Not A Pipe . '
ANNIE: -Wow .
RAY: You drive .
ANNIE: Mmm . Some kind of team sport ?
RAY: Annie , he was a baseball fanatic ! Listen to this He finds a page and reads from it
ANNIE: That 's sad
RAY: The man wrote the best books of his generation , he was a pioneer in the civil rights and anti-war movements , he made the cover of Newsweek , he knew everybody , he did everytinghe helped shape his time . He hung out with the Beatles ! But in the end , it was n't enough . What he missed was'baseball .
ANNIE: Oh my God !
RAY: What .
SPOOKILY: As a small boy , he had a bat named 'Rosebud . '
ANNIE: Sorry .
READING: He has n't been to a live baseball game since 1958 .
ANNIE: So to ease his pain , you have to take him to a ball game ?
RAY: Yes .
ANNIE: Ray , this is nuttier than building the field .
RAY: No it 's not . It 's pretty weird , I grant you , but building the field was weirder . Five , ten percent weirder .
ANNIE: I 'm sorry , pal , but I have to nip this one in the bud . We are having moderate to heavy financial difficulties here . You can not take off for Boston while you 're going broke in Iowa .
RAY: Annie , this is really new territory fo oth of us , I know , but we 're dealing with primal forces of nature , here . When primal forces of nature tell you to do something , the prudent thing is not to quibble over details and -
ANNIE: ( starting to get
PISSED: But why do you have to go ? Why ca n't the voice send someone else ? What 's wrong with Shirley MacLaine , she too usy ? What does this have to do with you ? ? ? Ray hears her anger and sits her down .
RAY: That 's what I need to find out .
ANNIE: Ray , we 're behind on the mortgage . That field ate up our savings . We could lose the farm .
RAY: I wo n't even stay in motels . I 'll sleep in the car , and I 'll beg for food .
ANNIE: No . This is too much.- I understand your need to prove to the world you 're not turning into your father , but you 've done it ! You believed in the magic , and it came true . Is n't that enough ?
RAY: Annie , it 's more than that . I know this- is nuts , but there 's another reason I 'm supposed to do it . I feel it . I feel it as strongly as I 've ever felt anything in my life . There 's a reason .
ANNIE: What . Just tell me what it is .
RAY: I think something 's going to happen at the game . I do n't know what , utthere 's something at Fenway Park in Boston , and I have to be there with Terence Mann to find it . Something he just said changes Annie 's mood .
ANNIE: Fenway Park Is that the one with the ig green wall in left field ?
RAY: Yeah .
ANNIE: I dreamt last night you were at Fenway .
RAY: Uh , was I sitting on the first base side ?
ANNIE: Yes
RAY: About the fifth row ?
ANNIE: ( nods ,
RAY: a hot dog . I had the same dream .
ANNIE: I 'll help you pack .
ANNIE: .you take that to 93 , and then it gets all squiggly , and after that you 're on your own . How are you going to find him , anyway ? He wo n't exactly be in the phone book , you know .
RAY: The article says he has a storefront on Harvard Street next to some place that sells Kosher food . Should n't be too hard to find . I do n't need a tie , do
ANNIE: No , dear . Not for a kidnapping .
RAY: You 'll be okay , right ?
ANNIE: I 'll try to sell the combine . We sure do n't need it anymore .
RAY: So long Tiger . He get into the car and looks up at Annie .
ANNIE: Ray , they 're not going to make a pass at me . They're'ghosts .
RAY: They 're jocks . Keep away from them .
RAY: Hi , I 'm Ray Kinsella . I 'm really a big fan of
DIFFERENT: How do you , Mr. Mann , I have to take you to a baseball game .
SHAKES HEAD: All right , put your hands up and get in the trunk !
FACETIOUSLY: Good .
RAY: He lives right around here . Do you know him ? I 'm a friend of his . The Butcher just stares back , with suspicion .
BUTCHER: If you was much of a friend , he 'd of give you the directions himself . Ray nods . He knows this is useless .
RAY: That 's a good point . Thank you . Ray exits .
ANCIENT WOMAN: I do n't know where he lives .
PUMP JOCKEY: Two blocks down . Right hand side . First store that do n't have a chicken in the window , is his .
MANN: Who the fuck are you ? ? ? -
RAY: Sir , my name is Ray Kinsella , and it 's a great pleasure 'Co finally -
MANN: We got a learning disability here ?
TALKS FAST: Mr. Mann , I 've come 1500 miles to see you at the risk of losing my home and alienating my wife . If I could just have a minute . Please .
MANN: Look . I ca n't tell you the secret of life , and I do n't have any answers fo you . I do n't give interviews , I am no longer a public figure , I just want to e left alone . So fuck off .
RAY: Just one minute . I 'm begging you . Mann looks him over . Then he sighs .
MANN: One minute .
RAY: Okay . I understand your desire fo privacy , and i would n't dream of intruding if this were n't extremely important .
MANN: Oh God . I do n't do causes anymore .
RAY: This is n't a cause . I do n't need money , or an endorsement .
MANN: Refreshing .
RAY: You once wrote 'There comes a time when all the cosmic tumblers have clicked into place , and the universe opens itself up for a few seconds , to show you what is possible . '
MANN: Oh my God .
RAY: What .
MANN: You 're from the Sixties !
RAY: Well , actually -
MANN: Out ! Out !
RAY: Just wait a second -
MANN: Back to the Sixties ! Back ! He is backing Ray out the door .
RAY: If you 'd just -
MANN: There 's no place for you here in the future ! Get back while you still can !
RAY: You 've changed , you know that ?
MANN: Yes . I suppose I have . How 's this ? 'Peace , love , dope . '
ROARS: Now get the fuck out of here ! ! !
MANN: Now you 've pissed me off .
RAY: Okay , hold it right there .
MANN: What the fuck is that ?
RAY: It 's a gun . What 'd you think it is ?
MANN: It 's your finger .
RAY: No it 's not . It 's a gun .
MANN: Yeah ? Let me see it .
RAY: Get out of here , I 'm not going to show you my gun . Mann sighs , and stands .
RAY: Now look . I 'm not going to hurt you , I just need you to go with me for a little while , then what are you doing ?
MANN: I 'm going to beat you with a crowba till you go away . Understandably , this makes Ray nervous .
RAY: Whoa ! Wait ! You ca n't do that .
STILL ADVANCING: What , are there rules ? There 's no ules .
RAY: You 're a pacifist ! Mann stops . He thinks . He lowers the crowbar .
MANN: Shit . Ray breathes a sigh of relief .
RAY: Thank you .
MANN: All right , are you kidnapping me ? What 's the deal here ?
RAY: I 'm sorry . I was hoping I could-just convince you to come with me .
MANN: Then you are kidnapping me .
RAY: I have to take you to a baseball game .
MANN: You what ?
RAY: Tonight 's game . Red.Sox , Twins .
MANN: Why ?
RAY: Something will happen there . I do n't know what , but we 'll find out when it does .
MANN: You 're seeing a team of psychiatrists , are n't you ?
LAUGHS: I do n't blame you for thinking that , but no , I 'm not . I swear to God I 'm the least crazy person I 've ever known .
MANN: Then why are you kidnapping me to a aseball game ?
RAY: I read an interview you gave a long time ago about how you always dreamed of playing at Ebbets Field , and how sad you felt when they tore it down .
MANN: I never said that .
RAY: You did n't ?
MANN: I do n't even remember thinking it . Now Ray is ndt sure what to do .
RAY: This whole . thing is so weird .
MANN: Then why go through with it ?
RAY: It 's a long storyand I 'll tell you on the way . Please .
MANN: I 'm not going to get rid of you , am I ?
RAY: If you just come to this game with me , I 'll never bother you again . Not even a Christmas card . Mann picks up a hat , .plops it on his head and heads out the door .
MANN: You do this often ?
RAY: No . It 's my first time . So be gentle .
MANN: Things used to be funny .
RAY: I 'm sorry . This is really humiliating . Which way is-Eenway ?
MANN: You 're really inept at this , are n't you ? Ray grins sheepishly and nods . Mann laughs .
RAY: ( no longer so
AMUSED: Okay , okay
RAY: Can I ask you a question ? Something I 've always wanted to know .
MANN: No , I never slept with her .
RAY: You never slept with who ?
MANN: Whoever you were going to ask me about . If I 'd been with one-tenth the famous women they said I was with , I 'd be in formaldehyde by now .
SOURLY: What 's your question ?
RAY: How 'd you get a name like Terence ? Mann can not believe that 's the question .
MANN: Rastus was taken .
MANN: Nice going , Boze .
RAY: Okay . I do n't really have a gun . So do n't say anything to this guy , okay ? I swear to God there 's a reason we 're supposed to be at this game . Mann gives him a `` Give me a break '' look .
RAY: Sorry .
POLICEMAN: License and registration .
MANN: Terry .
POLICEMAN: Where is it that you and Raymond are going , Terry ?
RAY: Fenway Park ! We 're going to the ball game .
MANN: Actually , Officer , I 'm being kidnapped .
RAY: 'Entertainment Tonight , doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
MANN,: What I mean by that is , I do n't care much for baseball , but Raymond insisted .
POLICEMAN: Yeah , I hate baseball . ( hands Ray back
HIS ID: Your right taillight is out , Raymond . I want you to get it fixed at the first opportunity .
RAY: Yes . I will . Thank you .
MANN: 'Raymond ? '
RAY: Ray . Myhostages call me Ray . Can I call you Terry ? Sourly , Mann nods . Ray smiles and drives off .
MANN: I did n't do it just because I do n't want the publicity .
RAY: Then what else ?
MANN: I envy you your craziness , Ray . It 's een years since I did something completely crazy .
RAY: Well , you want to hear something really crazy ?
MANN: Do I have a choice ?
RAY: Nope . I live on a farm in Iowa . One day , out in the cornfield , I heard a voice
HEAD: But ca n't you accept the probability that it 's all just a hallucination ?
RAY: Annie and Karin see it , too . They have reached the ticket window .
TICKET SELLER: Section seventeen . Twelve dollars . Ray takes out his wallet and turns to Mann..
RAY: It 's on me .
MANN: You 're damn right it is . Ray pays the man and receives the tickets .
TICKET SELLER: Game do n't start for a while , but you can go in , watch batting practice .
RAY: Great . They enter the stadium .
MANN: I live . I work . I 've learned to cook . I take walks . I watch sunsets .
RAY: Do n't you miss being involved ?
SNORTS: I was the East Coast distributor of 'involved. ' . I ate it , drank it , and eathed it . Then they killed Martin . They killed Bobby . And then they elected Tricky Dick . Twice . And now , people like you think I must be miserable that I 'm not involved anymore . Well , I 've got news for you I spent all my misery years ago . I have no more pain for any of you . I gave at the office . They approach the refreshment stand .
RAY: Sowhat do you want ?
. MANN: I want them to stop looking to me fo answers . Begging me to speak again , write again , be a leader . I want them to start thinking for themselves . And I want my privacy ! Ray looks slightly embarrassed .
RAY: No , I meant what do you want from
MANN: Oh .
HIMSELF: A dog and a beer .
RAY: Two .
TO MANN: Okay , I agree , you should be entitled to as much privacy as you wane . But why stop writing ?
MANN: I have n't published a word in seventeen years and I still have to endure assholes like you all the time . What do you think it 'd be like if I suddenly came out with a new book ?
MANN: They 'd bleed me dry .
RAY: God , this place is so beautiful .
MANN: Why are we here , Ray ?
RAY: Something.. about the game .
THE VOICE: 'Go the distance . '
RAY: Oh my God .
MANN: What 's the matter ?
RAY: Nothing .
MANN: You okay ? Ray sighs .
RAY: Yeah .
;THEN: Whenever you wanttogo , wecan go .
MANN: What ? ? ?
RAY: If you want to go , we can go .
MANN: Then let 's go .
MANN: Where are you goingfrom here ?
RAY: Home .
MANN: What is it you 're not telling me ?
RAY: I 've taken up too much of your time . Mann gets out of the car .
MANN: I wish I had your passion , Ray . Howeve misdirected it may be , it 's still a passion . I used to feel that way about things , but
MANN: You got another message , did n't you ?
RAY: You 'll think I 'm crazy .
MANN: I already think you 're crazy . What did it say ? After a little thought , Ray smiles sadly .
RAY: It said 'The man 's done enough . Leave him alone . '
MANN: 'Moonlight ' Graham . Ray 's jaw drops .
RAY: You saw it .
MANN: Saw what ?
RAY: New York Giants , 1922 . He played one game , never got to bat .
RAY: It 's all right to admit it . That 's what told me to find you . No response .
MANN: 'Go the distance . '
RAY: Do you know what it means ?
MANN: Yes .
RAY: What .
MANN: It meanswe 're going to Minnesota to find Moonlight Graham .
THRILLED: We ?
MANN: Yeah .
RAY: What do we do when we find him ?
MANN: We 'll know that when we find him .
PHONE; FILTERED: Oh , RayIs everything all right ?
RAY: Hey , guess what ? Terence Mann is with me . We 're going to Minnesota together .
PHONE; FILTERED: Are you kidding me ? Oh , Ray , that 's unbelievable !
RAY: I know . I got ta go . Hug Karin for me . I love you .
PHONE; FILTERED: I love you too . You guys behave yourselves . Hurry home .
MARK: Why did n't you tell him ?
ANNIE: For the same reason I 've never pissed on your birthday cake .
MARK: Annie , you do n't have a choice in the matter . Annie looks vertroubldye .
RAY: Half a dozen Grahamsno Archibald , no Moonlight .
MANN: Follow me .
MANN: We 're trying to find an ex-baseball player named Archibald Graham .
VEDA: You mean 'Doc ' Graham .
RAY: No , I think his nickname was 'Moonlight . '
VEDA: Yes , that 's Doctor Graham .
MANN: Doctor Graham . This is interesting news to Ray and Mann .
VEDA: His baseball career never amounted to much , so he went back to school . His father was a doctor .
MANN: Do you know where we can find him ?
RAY: It 's nothing bad . We 're not from the IRS , or anything -
VEDA: Doc Graham is dead . He died in 1972 .
VEDA: . 'And there were times when children could not afford eyeglasses or milk , o clothing . Yet no child was ever denied these essentials , because in the ackground , there was always Docto Graham . Without any fanfare o publicity , the glasses or the milk o the ticket to the ball game found thei way into the child 's pocket . '
MANN: You wrote that .
VEDA: The day he died .
MANN: You 're a good writer .
VEDA: Excuse me .
MANN: Something 's missing .
MANN: Half the towns in North America has a Doc Graham . What makes this one so special we have to come halfway across the country to find him fifteen years after he died ? There 's got to be more .
VEDA: You might want to talk to some of these people . They knew Doc pretty well . Mann takes the list and looks it over .
FIRST CODGER: Oh , that man had an arm on him . One day over at the ballpark , he said ' Lem me see that ball ' , and one of the boys threw him the ball , and he walked over behind home plate , reared back , and fired that all over the left field fence .
SECOND CODGER: And he was at least fifty years old when he did it .
FIRST CODGER: It was still rising when it disappeared .
NURSE: i went with him to make a housecall at one of the camps . .mining camps . The husband was sick , and they had no stove , so they had no heat .
BALDING MAN: He did n't smoke or drink , .but he used to chew up paper and spit it out wherever he went . If you were around Doc very long , you learned to duck .
MOUSTACHED MAN: He 'd even chew up his prescription slips , so sometimes we 'd have to dig into our pockets for a piece of pape so Doc could write us prescriptions .
SMOKER: 'Cept he was always , I mean always , losing them . Stores 'round town would just lean his umbrella somewhere nea the door , and if anybody asked , they 'd just say 'Oh , that 's Doc 's umbrella ' .
MANN: What was the umbrella for ?
BALDING MAN: Alicia . She moved to South Carolina after he passed . She passed a few years later . She always wore blue . I bet you did n't know that .
SMILES: No . I did n't .
MOTEL MANAGER: You know , everybody 's talking about you two . Our neighbors came over last night and we just told Doc'Graham stories until after midnight . I even wrote some of them down . She takes out a piece of paper .
RAY: That 's very nice of you .
MOTEL MANAGER: Well , it 's funny . It 's like all these memories we have of Doc had gone to sleep and sunk way down inside us . But once you started asking about him , and started us talking about him , why they swum back up to the surface again . Ray smiles .
MANN: No screwing , no drinking , no opium , no illegitimate children . No-midnight abortions , no shady finances .
RAY: You sound disappointed .
MANN: Shoeless Joe had a problem . That 's why he needed you . This guy does n't need us . Suddenly , Ray straightens with a start .
RAY: Oh , My God .
MANN: Damn .
READS: 'His son , who lives in New York City , notified police after receiving no answer to repeated telephone calls ' Shit . I 'd better call him . He pulls the phone onto the bed and dials
MANN: What the hell do I tell him .
RAY: You want me to ? He motions outside with his head .
MANN: Thanks . Ray exits .
RAY: Nominated ?
ELDERLY MAN: Who 's that ?
RAY: My name is Ray Kinsella . I 'm from Iowa . Are you Moonlight Graham ?
DOC GRAHAM: No one 's called me 'Moonlight ' Graham for fifty years .
RAY: Well , I 've come
HIMSELF: . a very long way to see you .
DOC GRAHAM: Funny . I could n't sleep tonight . Usually , I sleep like a baby . So I told Alicia I was going to take a walk .
RAY: Mind if i join you ? I 'd like to talk to you . Doc nods and they start to walk .
DOC GRAHAM: Let 's go to the high school . We can sit in my office . What do . you want to talk about ?
RAY: Well , first of all , how 'd you get to be called 'Moonlight ' ?
DOC GRAHAM: 'Cause of a night like this , long ago . I 'd just gotten to the minors , and I went out to the ballpark .
121 CONTINUED: DOC GRAHAM ( Cont 'd } There 's nothing as peaceful as a allpark at night . Like a church .
RAY: Yeah , I know what you mean .
DOC GRAHAM: Anyway , I fell asleep . Next morning , they found me in the on-deck circle , all curled up like a baby . Someone called me 'Moonlight , ' and it stuck .
RAY: When you got to the majors , you played only one inning of one game . What happened in that inning ?
DOC GRAHAM: It was the last day of the season . Bottom of the eighth , and we were way ahead . I 'd been up with the club fo most of a month , but had n't seen any action . Just then old John McGraw points a bony finger at me and says 'Right field . ' Well sir , I jumped up like I was sitting on a spring , grabbed my glove , and ran out onto the field .
RAY: Did you get to make a play ?
DOC GRAHAM: Nope . They never hit the ball out of the infield .
RAY: I was warned about you .
DOC GRAHAM: Anyway , one inning later the game was over , and so was I .
RAY: And what was that like ?
DOC GRAHAM: It was like coming this close to you dreams , and then watching them brush past you like a stranger in a crowd .
RAY: I did n't really know till just now . But I think it 's to ask you if you could do anything you wanted toif you could have a wish
DOC GRAHAM: Ahh
RAY: I do n't know . I 'm just asking
DOC GRAHAM: I never got to bat in the major leagues . I 'd have liked the chance just once to stare down a big league pitcher . Stare him down and then just as he goes into the windup wink ! Make him wonder if I know something he does n't . That 's what I wish for . The chance to squint my eyes when the sky is so blue it hurts to look at it , and to feel the 'tingle that runs up your arms when you connect dead-on . The chance to run the ases , stretch a double to a triple , and flop race-first into third , wrapping my arm around the bag . That 's my wish , Ray Kinsella that 's my wish .
RAY: What would you do if I said 'Yes ' ?
DOC GRAHAM: I think I might actually believe you .
RAY: There is a place where things like that happen . And if you want to go there , I can take you .
DOC GRAHAM: If it means leaving Chisholm He shakes his head.no . Ray is surprised .
RAY: I understand , but I think you 're supposed to come with us .
DOC GRAHAM: This is my most special place in the world , Ray . Once a place touches you like this , the wind never blows so cold again . You feel for it like it was you child . I ca n't leave here .
RAY: But your wish
DOC GRAHAM: It 'll stay one . I was born here , lived here , and I 'll die here . That 's okay . I 'll have no regrets .
RAY: But sixty-five years ago for five minutes you came this close . ( holds up two
FINGERS: It would kill some men to get that close to their dream and never touch it . They 'd consider it a tragedy .
DOC GRAHAM: Sonif I 'd only gotten to be a docto for five minutes . .now that would have een a tragedy .
DOC GRAHAM: Well , I 'd better get home before Alicia starts to thinking I 've got a girlfriend . And Doc Graham smiles at him .
RAY: And then I figured maybe we 're not supposed to take him with us . So now I do n't know why the hell we were supposed to come here .
MANN: Maybe it was to find out if one inning can change the world .
RAY: Did it ?
MANN: It did for these people . If he 'd gotten a hit , he might 've stayed there .
THEN: Your wife called before . She wants you to call her tonight .
ANNIE: Ray .
PAUSE: I asked the bank if we could miss a payment or two , and they told me they 'd just sold the note on the farm to Mark and his partners . So they own the paper now , and he says if we do n't sell to them , they 'll foreclose . Ray , we do n't have the money .
RAY: Okay , look . They ca n't foreclose fo thirty days , or something like that . I 've got to take Terry back to Boston first , so it 'll be -
MANN: No . Ray looks over at Mann .
RAY: We 're coming home.-
MANN: Hell , I could n't quit now . I 've got see this ballpark .
RAY: Not everybody can see it . You might not .
MANN: I 'll give it a try .
RAY: I need all the karma I can get right now .
TEENAGER: Thanks . You 're the first car by . I did n't expect to get a lift so soon . Ray starts the car back onto the highway .
RAY: How far are you going ?
TEENAGER: How far are you going ?
RAY: Iowa .
TEENAGER: Well , if it 's okay with you , I 'll ride along for a while . I play baseball . Ray and Mann exchange brief smiles .
RAY: This is your lucky day , kid . We 're going someplace kind of like that .
TEENAGER: All right !
RAY: I 'm Ray Kinsella , this is Terry Mann .
TEENAGER: Hi . I 'm Archie Graham . Mann and Ray just look at each other .
MANN: I 'm dying to ask him if he has a nickname .
RAY: Do n't . He did n't get it till he was in the minors .
MANN: Maybe we can give it to him .
RAY: Funny , the way he described towns , finding you a job so you can play on their teamthey have n't done that fo years . My Dad did that for a while . But that was in the Twenties .
MANN: What happened to your father ?
RAY: He never made it as ball player , so he tried to get his son to make it for him . By the time I was ten , playing baseball got to be like eating vegetables o taking out the garbage , so when I was fourteen , I started to refuse . Can you elieve that ? An American boy refusing to have a catch with his father .
MANN: Why at fourteen ?
RAY: That 's when I read The Boat Rocker , by Terence Mann .
MANN: Oh God .
RAY: I never played catch with him again .
SERIOUSLY: See , that 's the kind of crap people are always trying to lay on me . It 's not my fault you would n't play catch with your father !
RAY: I know . Anyway , when I was seventeen , we had a big fight , I packed my things , said something awful , and left . Afte a while I wanted to come home , but I did n't know how . I made it back for the funeral .
MANN: What was the awful thing you said ?
RAY: I said I could never respect a man whose hero was a criminal .
MANN: Who was his hero ?
RAY: Shoeless Joe Jackson . Mann considers this all very carefully .
MANN: You knew he was n't a criminal . Ray nods .
RAY: I was seventeen . Mann nods with growing understanding .
MANN: So this is your penance .
RAY: I know . I ca n't bring my fathe ack..
MANN: .so the least you can do is bring back his hero . Ray nods .
KARIN: Daddy !
BEAMING: Karin , Annie This is Terence Mann
MANN: Terry .
KARIN: Hiya Terry .
ANNIE: Welcome .
MANN: Thank you .
RAY: And this young fellow is Moon uh , Archie Graham . Karin and Annie shake his hand .
ANNIE: He 'll be able to do more than just practice .
RAY: What does that mean ?
ANNIE: Come on . They walk towards the field .
SHOELESS JOE: Hi , Ray , welcome back .
RAY: Thanks , Joe . Good to see you .
MANN: Oh my Lord .
RAY: What .
MANN: That 's Shoeless Joe Jackson !
RAY: Well of course it is .
MANN: I 've seen pictures . Those are the White Sox !
RAY: You mean you still did n't believe me ?
MANN: I thought I did , but Oh my Lord .
RAY: Terry , I 'd like you to meet Joe Jackson . Joe , this is Terry Mann . Mann and Jackson shake hands .
MANN: It 's a pleasure to meet you .
SHOELESS JOE: Pleasure 's mine .
TO RAY: Ray , I hope you do n't mind , but we got tired of just having practices , so we ought another team out with us so we could have some real games .
RAY: I do n't mind . Where 'd they come from ?
CHUCKLES: Where 'd we come from . Man , you would n't elieve how many guys wanted to play here . We had to beat 'em off with a stick .
BLEACHERS: Hey , that 's Mel Ott . And Carl Hubbell . Those are the New York Giants !
SHOELESS JOE: With a couple of Cardinals and A 's thrown in for good measure . Ty Co wanted to play , but none of us could stand the sonofabitch when we were alive , so we told him to stuff it .
TO ARCHIE: Hey , are you Graham ?
ARCHIE: Yes sir .
SHOELESS JOE: What the hell you doing on the sidelines ? You came here to play ball , did n't you ?
ARCHIE: Yes sir .
SHOELESS JOE: Go warm up !
THRILLED: Yes sir !
MANN: Unbelievable .
RAY: It 's more than that . It 's perfect .
MANN: Does he get a hit for that ?
RAY: Karin ?
KARIN: Um , no . The batter was trying to sacrifice .
RAY: So how do you score it ?
KARIN: Fielder 's choice ?
RAY: Very good .
MANN: You better sit here .
RAY: Look .
CATCHER: Good thing for you that was n't his fastball .
ARCHIE: Come on , let 's see your fastball .
ARCHIE °: Hey , ump , how about a warning ?
UMPIRE: Sure . Watch out-you do n't get killed .
OTT: Okay , kid , first two were high and tight , where do you think the next one 's going to be ?
ARCHIE: Either-low and away , or in my ear .
OTT: He do n't want to load the bases . Look for low and away .
LAUGHS: •Look at that . Mr . Cool .
MANN: Where do you go when you walk through that door ? What do you do ?
CHICK GANDIL: We sleep .
HAPPY FELSCH: And wait .
SHOELESS JOE: We dream .
RAY: You ca n't leave the field any other way , can you ?
SHOELESS JOE: Not if we want to come back .
RAY: I 'd love to go with you sometime . The silence that follows is long and ominous .
ARCHIE: Thanks . I ca n't stop shaking I 'm so happy . 'Course , I would 've liked a base hit
KARIN: But you got a RBI !
ARCHIE: I sure did , did n't I ?
YELLS BACK: A rookie 's luck ! They all laugh at that .
RAY: Well come on , this calls for a drink .
ARCHIE: I ca n't . I 'm
RAY: Good game , Archie .
ARCHIE: Thanks .
MANN: Good night , kid .
ARCHIE: Mr. Kinsella ?
RAY: I know . You 're welcome .
ANNIE: Once we fell behind in the payments , the full amount of the mortgage became due .
RAY: And they own the paper , so they have the legal right to foreclose .
ANNIE: Unless we sell .
RAY: Either way we lose the farm . Maybe we can make it a condition of the sale that they keep the field up .
ANNIE: Forget it . They 're buying up single farms all around us , make it one big farm . First thing they 'll do is plow under your field . Ray just sits there , letting that sink in .
MANN: I do n't have a lot of money , Ray , but maybe I could pitch in a little .
RAY: Fine . You can put in twenty bucks fo groceries .
MANN: That 's not what I meant . Maybe the eason you were supposed to find me was so I could help you with this .
RAY: More likely it 's that you 're supposed to start writing again . About this .
MANN: Do n't change the subject .
RAY: You promise to publish and I 'll let you chip in from your royalties .
MANN: One thing has nothing to do with the other .
RAY: I 'm not sure I agree with that .
MANN: You 're not only stubborn , you 're stupid .
RAY: That I wo n't argue with .
ANNIE: Honey , that was Mark . He 's coming tonight . He needs a decision tonight .
ANNIE: Everything is so perfect here .
RAY: Whatever I have to do to save this place , I 'll do .
ANNIE: I know .
RAY: He 's here .
MARK: Ray , it 's time'to put away our little fantasies and come down to earth .
RAY: It 's not a fantasy , Mark . They 're real .
EMPHATICALLY: Who 's real ?
RAY: Shoeless Joe Jackson . The White Sox . The Giants .
TO MANN: He ca n't see any of it .
MARK: And who 's that ? Babe Ruth ? Ray smiles , savoring the moment .
RAY: As a matter of fact , it 's Terence Mann .
MARK: Ah , how do you ? I 'm Michael Jackson .
TO RAY: Ray , we have to settle this thing right now .
RAY: I 'm not selling you my home .
MARK: You have no money , you 've got a stack of bills to choke a pig , and come fall , you 've got no crop to sell . But I have a deal to offer you that will allow you to stay on this land .
KARIN: Daddy , we do n't have to sell the farm .
MARK: Let us buy you out , and we 'll leave the house . You can live in it rent free as long as you want .
RAY: What about the baseball field ?
MARK: Do you realize what this land is worth ?
RAY: Over $ 2200 an acre .
MARK: Then you must realize we can not keep a useless baseball diamond in the middle of rich farmland .
RAY: No deal , Mark . We 're staying .
KARIN: We do n't have to go .
EXPLODES: You 're virtually bankrupt , and I 'm offering you a way to keep your home ecause I love my sister ! I 've got partners who do n't give a damn about you , and they 're ready to foreclose ight now !
KARIN: Daddy , we do n't have to sell the farm .
MARK: Karin , please !
RAY: Wait . They all turn to Karin .
KARIN: People will come .
RAY: What people , sweetheart ?
KARIN: From all over . They 'll just decide to take a vacation , see , and they 'll come to Iowa City , and they 'll think it 's eally boring , so they 'll take a drive . And they 'll drive down our road , and they 'll see the lights and they 'll think it 's really pretty .
MARK: You 're not listening to this seriously , are you ?
ANNIE: Yes .
MARK: Why would anybody pay money to come here ?
KARIN: To watch the game . And it 'll be just like when they were little kids a long time ago , and it was summertime , and they 'll watch the game and .remember what it was like .
MARK: What the hell is she talking about ?
ANNIE: She 's talking about people seeing thei memories touching their past .
NODS: People will come .
ANNIE: It 'll be like one of those tiny , French estaurants that have no sign . You find it by instinct . They 'll be drawn .
MARK: Okay , this is all fascinating , but the fact remains that you do n't have the money to bring the mortgage up to date , so you still have to sell . I 'm sorry , ut you have no choice .
MANN: Ray Ray looks at Mann .
MANN: People will come , Ray . They 'll come to Iowa for reasons they ca n't even fathom . They 'll turn up your driveway , not knowing for sure why they 're doing it , and arrive at your door , innocent as children , longing for the past . 'Of course we wo n't mind if you look around , ' you 'll say . 'It 's only twenty dollars per person . ' And they 'll pass over the money without even looking at it . For it is money they have , and peace they lack .
MARK: Just sign the papers , Ray .
MANN: They 'll walk out to the bleachers and sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect evening , or they 'll find they have eserved seats somewhere in the grandstand or along one of the baselines wherever they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes . They 'll watch the game , and it will be as if they 'd dipped themselves in magic waters . The memories will be so thick they 'll have to brush them away from their faces .
MARK: Listen to me . Tomorrow morning , when the bank opens , they will foreclose .
MANN: People will come , Ray .
MARK: You 're broke , Ray . Sell now or lose everything .
MANN: The one constant through all the years , Ray , has been baseball . America has olled by like an ` army of steamrollers . It 's been erased like a blackboard , ebuilt , and erased again . But baseball has marked the time . This field , this ° game it 's a piece of our past . It eminds us of all that once was good . And that could be again . People will come . People will most definitely come .
SINCERELY: .fuckin ' beautiful .
MARK: Ray . You will lose everything and you will be evicted .
RAY: I 'm not signing .
MANN: Ray
NARK: Who 's here ?
RAY: You do n't see those cars ? All those people ?
MARK: Do n't do this , you son of a bitch ! There 's no cars , no people
KARIN: Uncle Mark , I can see them .
ANNIE: We all can .
MARK: You 're crazy . You 're all bat-shit crazy !
RAY: Watch your language , Mark .
MARK: You build a baseball field in the middle of nowhere , you sit around here and stare at nothing -
KARIN: It 's not nothing .
MARK: And you 've turned your daughter into a goddamn moron !
RAY: Get your hands off her .
MARK: I 'm trying to help you , goddamnit !
RA Y: Karin ! !
MARK: Oh my God , I 'm sorryAnnieI did n't mean to
ANNIE: Should we move her ?
RAY: Get the car .
ANNIE: Is there a doctor ? A nurse ? Any of you ?
MANN: How long ?
RA Y: Its a twenty-minute drive .
RAY: Karin
DOC GRAHAM: What have we got here ?
RAY: She fell .
DOC GRAHAM: This child 's choking to death .
DCC GRAHAM: She 's okay . I do n't think the fall eally hurt her , just the dog in he throat . She 'll be coming around in a minute or two .
SIGHS DEEPLY: Thank you , Doc . Doc looks deeply into Ray 's eyes .
DOC GRAHAM: No , son . Thank you .
RAY: 'Oh , my God , you ca n't go back .
DOC GRAHAM: It 's okay
NODS KNOWINGLY: It 's okay .
MARK: I sawA11 of a sudden this kid runs off the field and turns.into
ANNIE: There 's hope for you yet , Mark .
DOC GRAHAM: Well , I best be getting back home before Alicia starts to thinking I 've got a girlfriend .
HAPPY FELSCH: Good work , Doc .
EDDIE CICOTTE: Way to go , Doc .
DOC GRAHAM: Thanks , boys . Win one for me , someday , will you ? He passes them .
SHOELESS JOE: Hev rookie ! Doc Graham turns .
RAY: Okay .

SHOELESS JOE: Out there .
MANN: What is out there ?
SHOELESS JOE: Come find out .
RAY: Wait a second . Why him ?
MANN: Ray , for God 's sake , I 'm unattached . You 've got a family . This takes Ray down a peg or two .
RAY: But I want to know what 's out there ! I want to see it !
MANN: There 's a reason they chose me , just as there was a reason they chose you to find me .
RAY: Oh yeah ? Why ?
MANN: Because , you big jerk , I gave that interview .
RAY: What interview ?
MANN: The one about Ebbets Field . The one that charged you up and sent you all the way to Boston to find me .
RAY: Then you lied to me .
MANN: You were kidnapping me at the time , you asshole ! Think of it , Ray maybe there 's an Ebbets Field still floating around out there somewhere . And maybe I 'll get to sit in the stands , and watch a twenty-year-old kid with a smooth face and kinky hair try out for the 1948 Dodgers .
RAY: So I do all the work , and all I get is to see everybody else 's dreams come true . Is that it ?
SHOELESS JOE: What are you saying , Ray ?
RAY: I 'm saying I 'm happy for you , and I 'm happy for him , but after all this what 's in it L for me ?
SHOELESS JOE: Is that why you did this ? For-you ?
MANN: There 's something out there for me , Ray . And what a story it 'll make a man eing able to touch the perfect dream .
RAY: Then you 'll write about it ?
MANN: You bet I will .
RAY: How you feeling , honey ?
KARIN: Stupid .
RAY: Terry 's been invited to go-with the players .

UNDERSTANDING: 'Ease his pain '
SHOELESS JOE: 'Go the distance . '
RAY: It was you .
SHOELESS JOE: No , Ray . It was you .
RAY: My God , I only saw him later , when he was worn down by life . Look at him .
RAY: He has his whole life in front of him , and I 'm not even a glint in his eye . What do I say to him ?
ANNIE: Introduce him to his granddaughter .

TECHNICIAN: It 's taking shape .
CAPTAIN: What the hell can it be ?
TECHNICIAN: Hook-up with the president in one minute , General . General Staedert remains calm .
STAEDERT: Send out a probe .

KORBEN: You do n't do what I say I 'll waste you myself . Got it ?
LOC RHOD: Got it
AKANIT: What 's the situation in the hall ?
MUGGER: There 's no more resistance . Everything 's under control .

LOC RHOD: This is amazing ! Korben , Korben Dallas , the winner of the Gemini Croquette
PRINCESS AACHEN: All this is terribly exciting , hmmm ? Loc Rhod covers his mike .

BABY RAY: What ? Another piece of the bar explodes .
KORBEN: The balls for Christ 's sake !
EMPEROR JAPHET: He wants the balls ! You deaf or something ?
KORBEN: How far is he from here ?
EMPEROR: I 'd say about thirty yards to the left .
LOC RHOD: And our man Korben has literally knocked out the opposition with an amazing 90 foot pitch .
FOG: Thanks for your help .
KORBEN: Forget it . Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him .
LEELOO: Kor ban
COP 1: Hey , who are you ?
KORBEN: The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest .
COP: What 's he doing ?
KORBEN: Six to the left . One to the right .
LOC RHOD: He 's on vacation .
KORBEN: We got to find the leader . Mangalores do n't fight without a leader .
AKANIT: One more shot and we start killing hostages , got that ?
KORBEN: Found him
AKANIT: Send someone to negotiate !
KORBEN: Mind if I go ? I 'm an excellent negotiator .
COP 1: Uh Sure , go ahead . Korben gets ready .
KORBEN: Anyone else want to negotiate ?
COP 2: Where 'd he learn to negotiate like that ?
MUNRO: From us ! The President gives Munro a hard look .
CORNELIUS: You 're probably very angry with me and I quite understand . But I want you to know I 'm fighting for a noble cause .
KORBEN: Yeah , I know to save the world but ight now all I want to do is save Leeloo .
CORNELIUS: Leeloo 's in trouble ?
KORBEN: When is she not in trouble ?
CORNELIUS: Uh.. Have you tried the Diva 's suite ?
POLICEMAN: More trouble ?
ZORG: Nothing I ca n't fix myself .
KORBEN: Leeloo ? Up in the airshaft , Leeloo has heard him .
LEELOO: Korben Her voice is too weak , Korben ca n't hear her .
LOC RHOD: Korben man what the hell is this ? Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance .
KORBEN: A molecular bomb . Three minutes left on the timer .
LOC RHOD: And , uh , what 're these numbers clicking y ?
CORNELIUS: Probably the time remaining before it explodes . Cornelius smiles and continues his search .
LOC RHOD: You 're just saying that to scare me ! Right ? If it was a bomb , an alarm would 've gone off . There 's bomb detectors in all these hotels !
KORBEN: Not without Leeloo . Loc Rhod can not take his eyes off the bomb .
LOC RHOD: Like D-Man , I hate to bother you but uh , like , we 're down to 2 minutes here
KORBEN: It 's the latest model.. I 've never seen one efore it works off a magnetic coded card Let 's see if I can rig it up .
LOC RHOD: Hey ! What are you doing ? The bomb !
KORBEN: Do n't worry , I 'm here now !
LOC RHOD: Like Korben , can I have 30 seconds of your time here ?
KORBEN: I 'll be right back .
ZORG: Allow me
KORBEN: Do n't you know how to count . It 's not all that hard . Watch !
LOC RHOD: Are you nuts , Father ? That hurts ! I ca n't feel my teeth .
CORNELIUS: Does n't matter all you need are you legs .
ZORG: I did n't fire three thousand rounds
LOC RHOD: You know how to fly this thing ?
KORBEN: It 's like a cab is n't it ?
VOICE: 30 seconds
KORBEN: Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate ?
ZORG: Maximum Protection .
KORBEN: Found it ? Loc Rhod searches frantically .
LOC RHOD: I do n't even know what I 'm looking for !
KORBEN: Fuck it ! Hold tight !
LOC RHOD: Dear listeners , your favorite DJ is alive and kicking . It 's seven o'clock and time for the news . Tune in tomorrow for another adventure .
ZORG: How 's that ? Can you hear me bette now ?
MUNRO: Major Dallas has the Five Elements on oard . The priest is guiding them directly to the temple . President Lindberg closes his eyes in relief .
PRESIDENT: Thank God ! We 've been saved ! A SCIENTIST rushes in .
SCIENTIST: Mr. President .
PRESIDENT: Yes ? Now , what ?
COMMANDER: It 's not only advancing , but it 's moving at incredible speed ! We 're having trouble following it .
PRESIDENT: And Do you have any idea where it 's heading ?
KORBEN: Apipoulai.. Leeloo smiles , weakly , feverish .
LEELOO: I 'm so very sad .
KORBEN: Why ? We did pretty well , would n't you say ?
LEELOO: Five hundred wars Arms Drugs Money Everything you create is used to destroy
KORBEN: I told you not to read all that crap !
LEELOO: Protect life Until death .
CORNELIUS: There 's a General on the phone His name 's Mambo , I think .
MUNRO: Munro here . President Lindberg wants to talk to you . Hold the line .
PRESIDENT: Major , first off , I want to thank you , in my name and in the name of the Federation
KORBEN: So now what 's the problem ?
PRESIDENT: There 's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diamete heading straight for the earth . And we have
KORBEN: How much time before the collision ?
SCIENTIST: If its speed remains constant in an hour and 57 minutes .
DAVID: You 're all safe . Thanks be to God !
CORNELIUS: Later , David ! Later ! There 's not a minute to lose ! The small group enters the chapel .
KORBEN: Excuse me , Father , but could we pray later ?
MUNRO: They just landed in the desert .
PRESIDENT: How much time is left ?
SCIENTIST: About nine minutes . President Lindberg has trouble breathing .
CORNELIUS: Uh , this one must be water ! It 's obvious he does n't know where to put it .
KORBEN: Do n't tell me you do n't know how all this works ?
CORNELIUS: Theoretically , yes ! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there , but I do n't have the reference book . I 've never seen the Stones work !
KORBEN: Match the symbols !
LOC RHOD: What is this some kinda game ? Like chess ?
KORBEN: No . It 's much simpler . If we do n't figure out where these Stones go in five minutes , we 're all dead ! Think you got it ?
CORNELIUS: Yes , of course , but The Stones are shut ! They have to be open for it to work .
KORBEN: And you do n't know how they open , is that what you are saying ?
CORNELIUS: That 's what I 'm saying .
KORBEN: Leeloo ? The Stones ! We have to open them ! How does it work ?
LEELOO: The wind blows the fire burns
KORBEN: I know all that , Leeloo ! I 'm talking about the Stones .
LEELOO: The rain falls
KORBEN: The rain falls the wind blows ?
LOC RHOD: I 'm looking , I 'm looking .
SCIENTIST: Three minutes .
MUNRO: We 've lost contact with them .
LOC RHOD: we 'll never make it .
KORBEN: What did you say ? What did you do ?
LOC RHOD: Nothing ! Swear to God , I did n't do nothing !
KORBEN: Look , you did something that set it off . Try to remember . Concentrate . Tell me exactly what you did ! !
LOC RHOD: I was like this With my hands here and I said , `` We 'll never make it ! '' That 's all ! Nothing happens .
KORBEN: Is that all ?
LOC RHOD: Yeah then I sighed like this .
KORBEN: The wind ! The wind blows
LOC RHOD: I do n't have a light . I stopped smoking last week ! If we 'd come a bit sooner
KORBEN: Do n't breathe .
SCIENTIST: Two more minutes .
KORBEN: It 's up to you now , Angel !
LEELOO: I 'm so tired
KORBEN: You can sleep tomorrow come on
LEELOO: I want to sleep forever
KORBEN: Leeloo ! Listen to me ! I 'll take you on a vacation afterwards ! A real vacation , this time , for as long as you want . Come on ! You can do it !
CORNELIUS: Come on Leeloo ! Come on !
SCIENTIST: It 'll be entering the atmosphere in one minute .
KORBEN: Leeloo ! If you do n't get on with the program we 're all gon na die ! And that 's not on my agenda for today . Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben 's neck .
LEELOO: What 's the use of saving lives when you see what you do with them !
KORBEN: You 're right but there are lots of good things beautiful things
LEELOO: Like love
KORBEN: Exactly .
LEELOO: But I do n't know love I 'm like a machine programmed to save other people 's lives but never to have one of my own .
KORBEN: Yes , you do ! I need you . More than you can imagine ! Stand up straight !
LEELOO: Why ? Why would you need me ?
KORBEN: Because
CORNELIUS: Tell her , for God 's sake !
KORBEN: Because
LEELOO: Tell me
KORBEN: I love you Despite her fatigue , Leeloo smiles broadly .
LEELOO: Now you 're allowed to kiss me .
SCIENTIST: The planet seems to have stopped at 62 miles from impact .
LOC RHOD: This guy is a killer with the babes . I knew it from the moment I laid eyes on him .
MUNRO: Mr. President , let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh , who runs the center .
MACTILBURGH: It 's an honor to receive you . Mr. President .
PRESIDENT: Yes.. Well ? Where are our two heroes ?
MACTILBURGH: They were so tired from their ordeal that we put them in the reactor this morning..
PRESIDENT: I have 19 more meetings after this one Professor..
PROFESSOR: Of course.. Let me see if they 're revived .
AIDE: We go live in one minute , Mr. President .
MACTILBURGH: I.. uh.. they need five more minutes , Mr. President .
AIDE: No ma'am I tried No ma'am
PRESIDENT: Who is it ?
AIDE: Some woman claims she 's Korben 's mother
PRESIDENT: Give it here

BUSINESS WOMAN: Which car company do you work for ?
JACK: A major one .
VOICE: There are three ways to make napalm . One , mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice

JACK: Pardon me ? Tyler turns to Jack .
TYLER: Tyler Durden . Tyler offers his hand . Jack takes it .
JACK: No , supply oxygen ?
TYLER: Oxygen gets you high . In a catastrophic emergency , we 're taking giant , panicked breaths
JACK: What do you do , Tyler ?
TYLER: What do you want me to do ?
JACK: I mean for a living .
TYLER: Why ? So you can say , `` Oh , that 's what you do . '' And be a smug little shit about it ?

SECURITY TFM: Baggage handlers . But when a suitcase vibrates , the throwers have to call the police .
JACK: My suitcase was vibrating ?
SECURITY TFM: Nine time out of ten , it 's an electric razor . But , every once in a while it 's a dildo . It 's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo . We use the indefinite aricle `` A dildo . '' Never `` You dildo . ''
JACK: I had everything in that bag . My C.K . shirts my D.K.N.Y . shoes
SECURITY TFM: Yeah , uh huh yeah ? Oh
DOORMAN: There 's nothing up there .

TYLER'S VOICE: I star-sixty-nined you . I never pick up my phone . What 's up ?
JACK: Well let me see here 's the thing
TYLER: This is how we fill up our lives . Tyler lights a cigarette .
JACK: I guess so .
TYLER: And , now it 's gone .
JACK: All gone . Tyler offers cigarettes . Jack declines .
TYLER: Could be worse . A woman could cut off your penis while you 're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car .
JACK: There 's always that .
TYLER: I do n't know , maybe I 'm wrong . Maybe it 's a terrible tragedy .
JACK: no no
TYLER: I mean , you did lose a lot of nice , neat little shit . The trendy pape lamps , the Euro-trash shelving unit , am I right ?
JACK: Delivered from Swedish furniture .
TYLER: Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns .
JACK: Delivered from Martha Stewart .
TYLER: Delivered from bullshit colors like `` Cobalt , '' `` Ebony , '' and `` Fuchsia . ''
JACK: Insurance 'll cover it .
TYLER: Oh , yeah , you got ta start making the list .
JACK: What list ?
TYLER: The `` now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again '' list . That list .
JACK: I do n't think so .
TYLER: This time maybe get a widescreen TV . You 'll be occupied for weeks .
JACK: Well , I have to file a claim
TYLER: The things you own , they end up owning you .
JACK: Do n't I ?
TYLER: Do what you like .
JACK: God , it 's late . I should find a hotel
TYLER: A hotel ?
JACK: Yeah .
TYLER: So , you called me up , because you just wanted to have a drink before you go find a hotel ?
JACK: I do n't follow
TYLER: We 're on our third pitcher of beer . Just ask me .
JACK: Huh ?
TYLER: You called me so you could have a place to stay .
JACK: No , I
TYLER: Why do n't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place ?
JACK: Would that be a problem ?
TYLER: Is it a problem for you to ask ?
JACK: Can I stay at your place ?
TYLER: Yes , you can .
JACK: Thank you .
TYLER: You 're welcome . But , I want you to do me one favor .
JACK: What 's that ?
TYLER: I want you to hit me as hard as you can .
JACK: What ?
TYLER: I want you to hit me as hard as you can . Freeze picture .
JACK: Tyler was a night person . He sometimes worked as a projectionist . A movie does n't come in one big reel , it 's on a few . In old theaters , two projectors are used , so someone has to change projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel begins . Sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand corner
TYLER: They 're called `` cigarette burns . ''
JACK: It 's called a `` changeover . '' The movie goes on , and nobody in the audience has any idea .
TYLER: Why would anyone want this shitty job ?
JACK: It affords him other interesting opportunities .
TYLER: Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films .
JACK: In reel three , right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag who have celebrity voices eat out of a garbage can , there 's the flash of Tyler 's contribution
TYLER: One-forty-eighth of a second . That 's how long it 's up there .
JACK: No one really knows that they 've seen it . But they did .
TYLER: A nice , big cock .
JACK: Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work .
TYLER: Do n't watch . I ca n't if you watch .
JACK: He farted on meringue ; he sneezed on aised endive ; and , with creme of mushroom soup , well
TYLER: I do n't know , either . I want to find out . I 've never been hit , have you ?
JACK: No . That 's a good thing , is n't it ?
TYLER: I do n't want to die without any scars . How much can you really know about yourself if you 've never been in a fight ? Come on you 're the only person I 've ever asked .
JACK: Me ? Jack stares at him .
TYLER: Why not you ? I 'm letting you go first . Do it .
JACK: This is crazy .
TYLER: Alright , go crazy . Let 'er rip .
JACK: Where do you want it ? In the face ?
TYLER: Surprise me .
JACK: Shit . Sorry . That did n't count .
TYLER: Like hell . That counted .
JACK: Strange .
TYLER: But a good strange .
JACK: Is it ?
TYLER: We 've crossed the threshold . You want to call it off ?
JACK: Call what off ?
TYLER: The fight .
JACK: What fight ?
TYLER: This fight , pussy .
JACK: Anyone ?
TYLER: Anyone . Jack thinks .
JACK: My boss , probably . Who would you fight ?
TYLER: My dad . No question . A long pause as Jack studies Tyler 's face .
JACK: Oh , yeah . I did n't know my dad . Well , I knew him , till I was six . He went and married another woman , had more kids . Every six years or so he 'd do it again new city , new family .
TYLER: He was setting up franchises . My father never went to college , so it was really important that I go .
JACK: I know that .
TYLER: After I graduated , I called him long distance and asked , `` Now what ? '' He said , `` Get a job . '' When I turned twenty-five , I called him and asked , `` Now what ? '' He said , `` I do n't know . Get married . ''
JACK: Same here .
TYLER: A generation of men raised by women . I 'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need .
JACK: We should do this again sometime .
TYLER: What car ?
JACK: What ?
TYLER: Oh , a new riot control grenade `` the successful combination of concussive , 3000 foot-candle flash- lasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement ofblah , blah , blah ''
JACK: `` I am Joe 's Lungs . '' It 's written in first person . `` Without me , Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red lood cells . '' There 's a whole series `` I am Joe 's Prostate . ''
TYLER: `` I get cancer , and I kill Joe . ''
JACK: What are you reading ?
TYLER: Soldier of Fortune . Business Week . New Republic .
JACK: Show-off .

JACK: You could take him .
TYLER: The trick is not to care . Tyler stares forward .
JACK: stop
TYLER: Cool . Jack limply shakes his Opponent 's hand .
OPPONENT: How about next week ?
JACK: Look at me . How about next month ?
TYLER: He fell down some stairs .
JACK: I fell down some stairs .
TYLER: Any historical figure .
JACK: Okay Ghandi .

JACK: Marla ?
MARLA: The forwarding number . I have n't seen you at any support groups .
JACK: That 's the idea we split them .
MARLA: You have n't been going to yours .
JACK: I found a new one .
MARLA: Really ?
JACK: It 's for men .
MARLA: Like testicular cancer ?
JACK: Look , this is a bad time
MARLA: I 've been going to debtor 's anonymous . You want to see some truly fucked up people ?
JACK: I 'm just on my way out
MARLA: Me too . I got a stomach full of Xanax . I took what was left of a ottle . Might 've been too much .
JACK: So you 're staying in tonight ?
MARLA: Do you want to wait to hear me describe death ?
MARLA'S VOICE: Do you want to listen and see if my spirit can use the telephone ?
JACK: You 're not going to believe what I dreamt last night .
MARLA: I can hardly believe anything about last night .
JACK: What are you doing here ?
MARLA: What ?
JACK: What the hell are you doing here ?
MARLA: Fuck you .
TYLER: She 's a piece of work . Get this I come in here last night , the phone 's off the hook
MARLA'S VOICE: I 'll tell you when I 'm floating out of my body . Tyler smiles .
MARLA: You got here fast .
COP: 8-G ! Where 's 8-G ?
MARLA: End of the hall . The rescuers keep running .
COP: Miss Singer , let us help you ! You have every reason to live !
MARLA: She 's a monster ! Infectious human waste ! Good luck trying to save her !
TYLER: Unbelievable , huh ?
JACK: No . Not at all .
TYLER: You 're sure ?
JACK: Yeah , I 'm sure .
TYLER: Good . This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room . The things that she said I 've never heard a woman talk like that
MARLA: I want to have your abortion .
TYLER: You 're okay with this ?
JACK: I 'm fine .
TYLER: She is a wild , twisted bitch . Stay away from that one .
JACK: Oh , and my pace is more librarians .
TYLER: Hey do n't knock librarians .
JACK: Marla does n't need a lover . She needs a case worker .
TYLER: She needs an exorcist . This is n't love . This is sport-fucking .
JACK: What ?
TYLER: You 've got ta understand something about me . I have a little rule , okay ? Do n't ever talk to her about me . Ever . I ca n't stand that kind of shit .
JACK: Okay .
TYLER: Promise you wo n't .
JACK: Yes , I promise .
TYLER: Promise ?
JACK: I said I promise !
TYLER: That was three times you promised .
MARLA'S VOICE: Miserable fucking discharge !
TYLER: What are you doing ? Jack steps back .
JACK: I uh just going to bed .
TYLER: You want to finish her off ?
JACK: Uh nah Jack continues toward his room .

JACK: What does that mean ?
DETECTIVE STERN: It means it was homemade .
JACK: This is really a shock
DETECTIVE STERN: Whoever set this homemade dynamite could 've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion . The gas , it seems , was just a detonator .
JACK: Who do you think could 've done this ?
DETECTIVE STERN: I 'll ask the questions , son .
TYLER: Tell him
JACK: Huh ?
TYLER: `` The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception . ''
JACK: Shhhhhh ! I do n't know what to make of this , sir , I really do n't

MARLA'S VOICE: My tit 's going to rot off .
JACK: Just a second . Could you excuse me ? I need to take this call .

MR. WAGGNER: Alright , you guys got everything ?
TOD: Yeah , we 're all set Dad .
MR. MURNAU: Les estudients , allons en France !
MR. WAGGNER: Does that mean `` go ? ''
ALEX: I will . Do n't worry .
TOD: I did n't think anything could worse than my yearbook picture .
GEORGE: Now you know how I feel havin ' to look at you all the time .
MR. MURNAU: Entendez classe , qu'est ce que c'est l'announce ? Everyone begrudgingly stops to listen .
CARTER: What the fuck 's he want ?
CLEAR: The airport does n't endorse solicitors .
MR. MURNAU: Tres bien , Clear ! Tout droit !
ALEX: Fuh-ck , do we have to put up with that shit the whole time ?
HARE KRISHANA: Death is not the end .
MS. LEWTON: It will be for you if you harass my students .
HARE KRISHANA: Hare Rama .
MS. LEWTON: Fuck off .
TICKET CLERK: I have a few questions to ask you this afternoon .
TICKET CLERK: Have you recieved any packages from persons unknown to you ?
TICKET CLERK: Same as your birthday .
BILLY: I ca n't believe they let that dickhead on this trip .
GEORGE: His parents bought a ton of those trip certificates we had to sell , just to get him out of their hai for ten days .
TOD: Dude , I so worked the ticket clerk so you 're sittin ' next to Christa and I 'm next to Blake . Alex looks up ahead of the metal detectors
CLEAR: Thanks .
TOD: Dude , get wisdom . We 're about to oard a seven hour flight . The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets . What if you ody wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torgue a wicked cable and then right afte you walks in Christa or Blake ? You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes ? Alex takes a beat to consider
ALEX: John Denver
P.A. SYSTEM: Ladies and Gentlemen , thank-you fo your patience , at this time we would like to begin pre-boarding of Euro-Ai Flight 180 to Paris through gate 39 .
MS. LEWTON: Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock ? How 'd we lose him ?
MR. MURNAU: Vingt huit , vingt neuf
GEORGE: Good sign . Younger the better . It would be a fucked-up God to take down this plane .
CHRISTA: Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together ? I asked Tod , but he says he 's got some medical thing ?
TOD: Fag .
ALEX: C'mon , man , like you really thought you were gon na tittie fuck 'em ove Greenland , or something ?
TOD: Because of you , I got ta sit here and watch fuckin ' `` Stepmom . ''
CHRISTA: Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together ? I asked Tod , but he 's got some medical thing .
TOD: Dude , what up ?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Is there a a problem , sir ?
CARTER: What 's your fuckin ' problem ?
MR. MURNAU: Alex ? Qu'est-ce se ?
ALEX: Qu'est-ce se ? ! THE PLANE 'S GON NA
CARTER: Sit ! DOWN ! Browning !
ALEX: I 'm not joking ! I 'm not joking !
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Sir , we will remove you from the aircraft if this continues .
CARTER: I 'll remove him .
ALEX: Fuck you ! I 'll remove myself !
TERRY: He did n't do nothin ' !
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Anybody in the aisle is off the plane !
BILLY: No , wait , I was late that 's my seat right there !
BILLY: I did n't do anything ! I have my ticket right here !
MS. LEWTON: PLEASE I 've got forty students going to Paris
TOD: It 's alright . It 's alright . You 're off the plane . You 're off the plane
MS. LEWTON: Airline 's not taking this very well . They 'll let one of us back on and the rest can grab a six-ten flight . Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle . It 's alright . It 's not that big of a deal .
MR. MURNAU: I 'll stay .
MS. LEWTON: No , you know the whole French thing . Get on the plane .
BILLY: I was in the bathroom . The lock was stuck . I did n't fight with anyone !
TOD: I called your mom and dad and they 're on their way .
MS. LEWTON: Alex , talk to me . What happened ?
ALEX: I I saw it like , I do n't know the plane took off . I saw it leave the runway I looked down and saw the ground Ms. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances .
TOD: Been on many planes that blew up , have you ? Good point . Alex looks away .
MS. LEWTON: You must have fallen asleep .
CARTER: We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris because Browning has a bad dream ? It 's going to explode ! It 's going to explode !
TOD: Fuck off , Horton .
MS. LEWTON: Tod A raw nerve , Alex stands .
ALEX: Only trip you 're gon na take is to the fuckin ' hospital .
BILLY: There they go and here we stay .
CARTER: You 're payin ' for my trip , Browning !
ALEX: I wish you were on the plane !
MS. LEWTON: Is everyone dead ? Are there any survivors ?
ALEX: How would I know ? You think I 'm some sort of
CLEAR: He 's not a witch .
SEIGEL: Hello . I 'm Howard Seigel , National Transportation Safety Board vice chairmen . We 've notified your families and they are on their way . Does anyone feel they need medical attention o spiritual counseling at this time ?
MS. LEWTON: Have they found any survivors ? What 's going on ?
SEIGEL: The cause of the explosion is undetermined . Nassau county authorities are on the scene . Naval search and rescue are en route .
WEINE: We understand how you must be feeling at this hour and although we know it may be difficult , we must ask you some questions regarding today 's events , while it 's still fresh in your minds .
SCHRECK: You said `` Listen to me ! This plane will explode on take-off . '' How did you know that ?
WEINE: Did you take any seditives before oarding , or on the plane . Sleeping pills ?
ALEX: No . I saw it . I saw it !
SCHRECK: Did this `` weird feeling '' have anything to do with you saying you wished Carter Horton was on the plane just before it exploded ?
ALEX: No !
SCHRECK: Why 'd you say it ?
ALEX: Because I never thought it would really happen . Weine leans foward
WEINE: If that 's the case , Alex why did you really get off the plane ?
TOD: My brother told me to keep an eye on Alex . He stayed and I went to make sure Alex was okay . He told me to get off the plane .
MS. LEWTON: Larry Murnau told me to get back on but I told him to go . I sent him back on the plane .
WEINE: No one forced you to get off the plane . You told us you are n't friends with any that did so , why did you leave the airplane ?
CLEAR: Because I saw and I heard Alex . And I believed him .
CLEAR: Here 's good . The car pulls over .
CARTER: Hope you do n't think , Browning , that ecause my name ai n't on this wall that I owe you anything .
ALEX: I do n't .
CARTER: All I owe is these people . To live my life to the fullest . Alex winces from Carter 's breath
ALEX: Then maybe you should lay off the
CARTER: Do n't ever fucking again tell me what to do . I control me . Not you .
BILLY: I took my driver 's test this week at the DMV Alex turns to him , increudlously..
ALEX: Not here , not now . Not EVER !
BILLY: If I ask out Cynthia Paster , will she say `` no ? ''
ALEX: Ms. Lewton
MS. LEWTON: Do n't talk to me . You scare the hell out of me .
TOD: Hey .
ALEX: I do n't want to sound gay , o nothin , but I miss you .
TOD: Me , too . But my dad does n't understand . When he 's better ; you and me , road trip to the City . Catch the Yanks .
ALEX: That 's a plan .
TOD: I got ta go . This thing Ms. Lewton showed me in her class , they 're gon na let me read it . It says what I 'm feeling .
CLEAR: Because of you I 'm still alive . Thank you .
ALEX: What happened ? Is Tod alright ?
MR. WAGGNER: Did n't you `` see '' it ?
ALEX: Mr. Waggner
MR. WAGGNER: You caused Tod so much guilt ove George staying on the plane that He took his own life . Alex is stunned , defensive .
ALEX: He would n't do it !
MR. WAGGNER: All my wife and I will ever know is we would n't have lost our youngest son if you 'd told our oldest to get off the plane .
ALEX: It 's only the end of June .
CLEAR: Yeah , but everthing 's always in transition . If you focus , even now , one week into summer you can feel Autumn coming . Almost like bein ' able to see the future .
ALEX: Like , um you 're mad about something ?
CLEAR: A piece of debris from the plane . I went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach .
ALEX: You went there ? I 've wanted to go there , but I thought it was off limits .
CLEAR: It is . But that did n't stop me . Should n't stop you .
ALEX: Why were you there last night ?
CLEAR: Look , I 've seen enough T.V . to know the F.B.I . does n't investigate teen suicides . But they were there last night , that means one , they still do n't have a clue what caused the crash . Two , they have n't ruled out anything . And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough , not to mention , that one of those people had a vision , o whatever , of it exploding minutes efore it did explode , is highly suspicious . And it does n't help that the visionaries ' friend just committed suicide .
ALEX: Why were you there last night ?
CLEAR: Know what this is ?
ALEX: I 'm really sorry .
CLEAR: Like you , the sculpture does n't even know what , or why , it is . Reluctant to take form . And , yet , creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction . Uncertain , and yet moved , Alex listens .
ALEX: I 've never dealt with death before . I was n't alive when my grandparents died . I wish I could know . I mean , all this could just be in ou heads . Now it feels like it 's everywhere .
CLEAR: `` It ? ''
ALEX: What if Tod is just the first of us ?
CLEAR: Is that something you 're `` feeling ? ''
ALEX: I do n't know . I wish I could just see him one more time , then , maybe I would know .
CLEAR: Then , let 's go see him !
ALEX: This place ? !
CLEAR: Doin ' somethin ' I 'm not supposed to .
ALEX: That him ?
CLEAR: I think . But why 'd they make him up like Michael Jackson ?
ALEX: That 's him , but he 's not here . That whatever that whateve made him Tod is gone .
ALEX: Why.. ?
MR. BLUDWORTH: Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm .
ALEX: I 'm a friend of his . His best friend . See , his father
MR. BLUDWORTH: I know who you are .
CLEAR: They said he hung himself , but there 's no marks .
MR. BLUDWORTH: I crafted a reconstruction of the Laryngeal prominence region with Velvetone Surgical Wax and Permaseal .
ALEX: What are all those tiny marks ?
ALEX: Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide ?
CLEAR: Why would they say it was a suicide if it were n't ?
ALEX: His father 's pretty fucked up with denial . Maybe he could n't deal with the thought of an other accident taking another son .
MR. BLUDWORTH: In Death
ALEX: You saying Tod did kill himself ?
MR. BLUDWORTH: Suicide . Murder . Plane crash . What does it matter ? He was going to end someday . From the minute you 're cut loose from the womb it 's a one way ticket on a trip to the tomb .
ALEX: Design ?
MR. BLUDWORTH: If Life is like a box of chocolates Death Death is like a big Milton Bradley game of `` Mouse Trap . '' The day you 're born is just the boot , hanging from the streetlamp , kicking the marble to get things rolling . Growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute . You feel immortal having survived school , sex , drugs ' n ' rock ' n ' roll , but you 've really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the athtub . Marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see-saw and flips the diving man into the big arrel . In the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage attling down until it captures the mouse . Game over .
ALEX: Maybe there 's no way to win ut if you figured out the game you knew where the `` steel all was rolling '' could n't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time ? Could n't you cheat Death at Its own game ?
MR. BLUDWORTH: You already did that by walking off the plane . Now you got ta out when and how it 'll come back at you . Play your hunch , Alex . If you think you can get away from it . But beware the risk of cheating the plan , disrespecting the design could iniciate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the Grim Reaper . And you do n't even want to fuck with that Mack Daddie .
ALEX: I 'm sorry we broke in .
MR. BLUDWORTH: No harm . No foul . Alex grabs her arm , starting toward the door .
CLEAR: We did n't find what we were looking for . Alex looks at Bludworth
ALEX: Yeah , we did .
ALEX: He said Death has a design . Even efore he said that I had been seeing patterns .
CLEAR: As in flannels and plaids ?
ALEX: How many died on Flight 180 ? From our group ?
CLEAR: Thirty-nine .
ALEX: Remember the gate number ?
CLEAR: No .
ALEX: Thirty-nine .
CLEAR: Like 4 25 .
ALEX: Right . April 25th .
CLEAR: Wait . I thought you meant the time of your birth . Four/Twenty-five , as in , month and day that 's a reach .
ALEX: My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die ! That 's a each ! ?
CLEAR: You 're sounding like those people who , you know `` Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in a theatre and hid in a warehouse . ''
ALEX: I 'm not just layin ' down a bunch of math here , with this . I 'm talking about indications omens that day , that we were meant to die . That , if , we have been aware of would have saved everyone on the plane .
CLEAR: That 's total bullshit . You can find death omens anywhere you want to . She picks up her paper coffee cup .
ALEX: Clear , how do we know that by just sitting here , breathing this air or sipping the coffee , having crossed the street we have n't started in motion the events that will lead to our death ? Fifty years from now . Ten years . Tomorrow . You do n't unless you 're able to open yourself to the signs I 'm willing to show you .
CLEAR: I do n't understand did you see
ALEX: No , but it might as well be the same thing . This was a message from someone , or something hinting at the design .
CLEAR: Alex , on the plane you must have experienced some kind of hype awareness . But here you 're suggesting Tod 's death and maybe our own will happen because of an active Presence . Alex nods , feeling she 's understanding .
ALEX: The mortician said Death has a design . Now if you , me , Tod , Carter , Terry , Billy , Ms. Lewton messed up that design , because , fo whatever reason , I was able to see Death 's plan then we cheated it . But what if it was our time , what if we were not meant to get off that plane ? What if it is still is ou time ? If It is still not finished with us ? We will all still die ; now , not later .
CLEAR: After hearing you , just now I do elieve
ALEX: Then there 's no one left who can help me .
TERRY: Baby , come on not now .
CARTER: Kind of have a reunion , here .
TERRY: Let it go !
CARTER: When are you moving ?
MS. LEWTON: A couple of weeks .
CARTER: We 're losing our favorite teacher .
ALEX: Look , there 's something you should all know .
CLEAR: Alex
TERRY: Shut up ! The both of you ! The two boys stop their heated exchange .
KEN: It 's that girl Clear .
ALEX: Dad you and mom have helped me out , so much . But there 's some things I need to understand before I can talk to anyone about it .
MS. LEWTON: Laura , I got ta call you back . She immediately hangs up and speed dials .
SCHRECK: What are you doing ?
SCHRECK: Get in the car .
ALEX: I believe that Ms. Lewton 's next .
WEINE: `` Next ? ''
ALEX: Yes see , there 's this pattern that 's occuring .
WEINE: Oh , you 've noticed it , too ?
MS. LEWTON: Oh mom 's favorite .
SCHRECK: Where 'd you get this `` pattern '' from ? You have another `` vision ? '' Maybe saw it in some T.V . static ? Alex is insulted by the condescending tone .
ALEX: I did n't ask for what happened to me on the plane . You can make fun of me . You can think I 'm a nut . I 'm used to it . I saved six lives but the entire school acts like I 'm a freak . Fine . Alex takes a nervous breath
WEINE: Alex , you got our attention , at first , because you were unde suspicion in the plane explosion . Alex tenses , but Weine shakes his head .
ALEX: No I ca n't . As long as I 'm in here , it 's outta my control .
WEINE: Alright , go on . Get outta here .
SCHRECK: Kid gives me the creeps .
WEINE: We got nothing to hold him .
SCHRECK: I do n't mean that There 's a couple of times , there I almost believed him . Weine considers , yet remains skeptical .
WEINE: Sometimes , you give me the creeps .
JOHN DENVER: I 've seen it rainin ' fire from the sky
BILLY: Hey , Alex
CLEAR: I do n't know where he is . He 's not talking to me .
WEINE: Why ? She studies the men before averting her eyes .
CLEAR: Because I did n't believe him .
SCHRECK: If he should contact you , it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us .
CLEAR: What are you doing ?
CARTER: Terry 's name should be on this wall . Clear is touched by the action .
CLEAR: They 're watching me , see if I go to Alex .
BILLY: Are you ?
CLEAR: They 'll follow my car . That 's why you 're taking me .
CARTER: Why would I want to see him ?
CLEAR: Because he knows which one of us is next .
BILLY: Um okay drive the speed limit , ight ?
CARTER: Billy ! I 'm gettin ' a vision ! You 're the next one
BILLY: Hey , man , why 'd you say that ? !
CARTER: 'Cause if you say another word , I 'm gon na fuckn ' kill ya !
CLEAR: He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the shore . You guys drive down there , start this way and we 'll meet around the middle . It 'll take half the time .
CLEAR: When I was a kid , like , six o seven I used to worry so much about my parents dying . Like lying awake at night just worrying . I loved them so much . I did n't want them to get hurt . And what would happen to me ? What would life be like ? Every night it seemed .
ALEX: Most kids do , I guess .
CLEAR: Most kids never have it happen . Alex hangs his head
ALEX: This wo n't be safe .
CLEAR: Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away .
ALEX: No.. I mean , I do n't have anything on me . This wo n't be safe .
CLEAR: Nothing is anymore .
ALEX: I ca n't go home . After Lewton 's , they 'll be after me .
CLEAR: We 're takin ' you to a cabin in the woods , it 's only a couple miles from my house . Keep off the highways , they 'll be lookin ' for us .
CARTER: Alright , Browning , you fuckin ' warlock did you know about Ms. Lewton , or what ?
ALEX: Why do you think I was hiding ?
CLEAR: Billy told the F.B.I . he saw you unnin ' away from her house .
ALEX: They blame me for everything . Her , Tod , the plane crash
BILLY: Your shoe prints were in the blood . Your fingerprints on the knives
ALEX: I already told you
CARTER: I 'm not talkin ' about if you did it . Or if you knew she was dead Did you know she was going to be next before she was ?
ALEX: Yeah . When she died at that moment , I could tell she saw something horrible .
CARTER: Out of us who 's next to see it ? Alex eyes them hesitant to respond .
BILLY: Please tell me I 'm gon na get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl .
CARTER: Me , right ? That 's why you 're not saying . Billy looks out the window , despondent .
BILLY: Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool , that time
CARTER: Whatta you whinin ' about ? He said I 'm next .
CLEAR: He did n't say nothin ' . Just drive .
CARTER: You have a responsibility to tell me .
ALEX: Is knowing going to make it easier ? It makes it harder .
CARTER: You get off havin ' control over me . Let me choose how to deal with it .
ALEX: It does n't matter who 's next we 're all on the same list . The three are silent .
CARTER: Aww , fuck really ?
CLEAR: Knock it off !
CARTER: May as well go out under my own free will , right ?
CLEAR: Not with us in the fuckin ' car !
CARTER: What 's your fuckin ' worry ? If it 's not your time ? I could get nailed unnin ' this red light and you all would n't get shit ! Only me , right ?
BILLY: And I fuckin ' HATED FRENCH CLASS !
CARTER: That 's what I 'm doin ' !
CLEAR: I know what you 're doing ! It 's alright to be scared , Carter . You do n't have to prove to us how big your balls are . Not now .
CARTER: I 'm not afraid ! I DECIDE WHEN IT 'S TIME ! I control my life ! I control my death !
BILLY: Watch it ! Watch it !
CLEAR: We 're afraid , too , Carter , but we 're not going to quit . Maybe you are . You act like you 're not , but you are ! Carter eyes Clear in the rearview mirror .
ALEX: Billy , get out !
CLEAR: Carter , get out !
CARTER: It ai n't my time .
BILLY: Man , he really is next . Alex takes off toward
CARTER: It broke !
BILLY: No one 's that strong .
CLEAR: Bullshit . He saved your lifeagain !
CARTER: SHUT UP , BILLY !
CLEAR: WE DO N'T NEED THIS NOW !
CARTER: FUCK YOU , BILLY ! I 'M NOT DEAD !
CARTER: Jesus fucking Christ !
ALEX: You should have been next . Afte Lewton , you should 've been next . That 's the only pattern . You should e dead .
CARTER: You 're the fuckin ' devil .
ALEX: But I saved him . I intervened . Just like the plane . That 's the design .
CLEAR: Police are coming .
ALEX: That 's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion ; Billy .
CARTER: `` Intervention ? '' What are you , God now ? !
ALEX: Of course not ! Gods are n't afraid to die ! Gods do n't die ! We do !
CLEAR: You 're losin ' it . The police will be here . We have to go to the cabin . You can hide there . Get your head together .
ALEX: After Billy it 's me . And then you . Clear grabs Clear and touches her face .
CARTER: Then , get out of here .
ALEX: Rusted . Tetanus . Nice touch . I overlooked it . You tried to capitalize . But I caught you , you fuck . I can beat you . Not forever , but I got this cabin igged to beat you NOW !
WEINE: She was up there a minute ago
CLEAR: I 'm not turning him in . There 's another life that needs him now . The two agents remain respectful
WEINE: You ca n't . She considers and understands .
CLEAR: Do n't hurt him .
WEINE: Tell us where he is . Wait at home , and I promise we 'll bring him ack safe , in protective custody . As she senses the agents ' sincerity
SCHRECK: There !
CLEAR: Run !
WEINE: Lost him .
SCHRECK: From the direction there 's only one place he can heading
ALEX: Do n't move !
ALEX: You 're grounded in the car . Do n't touch anything . DO N'T MOVE .
WEINE: Alex , get away from there !
SCHRECK: Any part of that line touches you , you 're dead .
WEINE: Get back ! You 'll both die !
ALEX: You know what to do .
CLEAR: No ! No ! Do n't !
ALEX: When I do this.. it 'll have skipped you and it 'll all be over .
SCHRECK: Is he alive ?
DOCTOR: A little more . Little more !
DOCTOR: He 's here . A beautiful boy .
CLEAR: I felt him ! When the baby was orn I felt Alex pass through me like the night he died
BARBARA: Exactly a year to the minute .
CLEAR: We beat it , Alex .
CARTER: Alex was right . Clear looks up .
CLEAR: I believe that 's what Alex elieved . But how do we know this was n't the design all along ?
KIMBERLY: Thanks , Dad . I 'll call you .
MR. BURROUGHS: Fix -A-flat ? Road flares ? Sunblock ? Mace ?

ISABELLA: could n't Keep your dick in check for another month ? I knew this would happen when I got pregnant . She pounds the steering wheel , furious .
FRANKIE: Gas it around these idiots . We do have 1200 miles to go , you know .
NORA: Tim , will you cut that out ? I ca n't even hear myself think . Tim frowns and then winces , holding his jaw .
NORA: I know , we 'll be there soon .
FRANKIE: Ever hear of the Ozone layer , asshole ?
THOMAS: Son of a bitch .
FRANKIE: A Trans Am . That shit went out with New Kids on the Block .
FRANKIE: Who ?

KIMBERLY: No ! We 'll all die if we do ! The cop turns on his FLASHERS .
DANO: I told you she 'd ruin everything !
SHAINA: Shut up , Dano , just stay cool . He 's just stoned .
THOMAS: What 's going on here ?
KIMBERLY: There 's going to be a pile up . Logs . Bodies everywhere . I saw it happen . It happened .
THOMAS: Miss , please step out of the vehicle .
ISABELLA: Excuse me , but is there some way we could just drive around ? I have a delivery .
NORA: What on Earth are they doing ?
TIM: Who am I , David Blane ?
KIMBERLY: The radio played the same songs , the old lady 's bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition .
THOMAS: Alright miss , calm down . I just need this lane open . I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder !
KIMBERLY: You 're not listening to me ! You have to do something !
EVAN: Arrest this whack-job , wouldja ? Some of us have lives , y'know .
KIMBERLY: Why wo n't anyone listen to me ? Thomas , subtly reaching for his cuffs .
THOMAS: I 'm not going to tell you to calm down again
ISABELLA: You could n't keep your dick in check for a month ? !
KAT: Great , now I 'm really gon na be late . Thomas barks into the radio handset
THOMAS: L.A. 51 , I need assistance and equesting paramedics for a majo T.A . At
SHAINA: Kimberly , what 's going on ?
EVAN: I do n't know what you want from me . Some crazy chic k blocks the highway with her car , said there 'd be an accident and there was . Big deal . Even a broken watch is right twice a day
KAT: Not to sound insensitive , but how much longer is this going to take ?
EUGENE: If I do n't get back to my classroom soon , the kids 'll tear the room apart .
NORA: Those poor people . To think it would 've been us if not for
THOMAS: Tell me again how it started .
KIMBERLY: Like I said , it was like I was there . I remember everything . The sounds of the crashes , the smells , the look on Shaina 's face
THOMAS: Do you remember what triggered it all ?
KIMBERLY: The log truckand everybody I guess . Everyone was driving like a maniac . And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen , even before it did .
THOMAS: You knew ? You just mean a hunch , ight ? A bad vibe , maybe ?
KIMBERLY: More than that . All the songs on the radio were about car crashes . Some kid 's banging toy cars together . She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on . His car was leaking oil all ove the road .
RORY: Hey , do n't be knockin ' the Chevette .
KIMBERLY: Billboards about accidents . Kids yelling `` pile up '' for no reason . It all feltjust wrong . Just like
THOMAS: Like what ?
KIMBERLY: I know this sounds crazybut you all heard about Flight 180 , right ? The kid who got off the plane ?
THOMAS: You mean Alex Browning .
KIMBERLY: My Premonition was just like his .
NORA: What are you talking about ?
NORA: Maybe
EUGENE: But this is where it starts to get freaky . So a month goes by , everything seems cool , but then the survivors start dying one boy one . 'Cause when your number 's up , it 's up , right ? Some people said Death itself started coming for them , hunting down every last one , until they were all dead . Everyone tenses up .
THOMAS: Well , not quite all of them . Clea Rivers checked herself into a padded room at Stoneybrook .
KIMBERLY: You do believe me , do n't you ?
DETECTIVE SUBY: Officer Burke ? Could I see you in here ?
DETECTIVE SUBY: I thought we we re finished with this bullshit . This is police work , not the psychic Hot Line .
KIMBER LY: But if I was never meant to pull over , then we all should have died in the pile up .
TIM: Which means Death could be coming for us . Detective Suby looks pissed o ff .
DETECTIVE SUBY: Way to console the witnesses Burke .
NORA: You 're all certifiable , you know that ? I ca n't believe I 've been listening to this crap . Come on , Tim , let 's go outside .
TIM: Jeez , Mom , stop trippin ' .
EUGENE: Look lady , we 're just yankin ' you chain .
RORY: Yeah , you 're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something .
NORA: What 's wrong with you people ?
MR. BURROUGHS: Kimberly
DETECTIVE SUBY: Sure , you can all go .
KAT: First I 'm stuck with Jury Duty , now this nonsense .
RORY: Yeah , I hate to love and leave ya , ut I 've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season .
KIMBERLY: I know it 's crazy , but I 'm really scared for the others . I 've got this terrible feeling .
MR. BURROUGHS: What feeling ?
KIMBERLY: That it 's not over yet .
MR. BURROUGHS: Don 't worry . Everything will be fine , you 'll see .
EVAN: Motherfucker .
DETECTIVE SUBY: Ooooh , I see it now . You future A transfer to anothe department .
THOMAS: You 've made your point .
DETECTIVE SUBY: Good . Cause we just got some new info and I do n't ne ed you getting freaky on me .
THOMAS: What ?
DETECTIVE SUBY: Evan Shaeffer 's dead . Guess he was n't as lucky as we thought .
KAT: No , Mom . Just turn on any station , they 've been playing it all day . Yes , Mother . Channel four will do just fine . Here it is , got ta go .
MR. BURROUGHS: My Lord
KIMBERLY: Do n't . I have to see this .
RORY: Whoohoo ! You see that shit ? Right there ? That 's my fuckin ' car right there ! Oh God , that 's dope .
NORA: Come on , Tim , lights out already .
TIM: Mom ?
NORA: Yeah ?
TIM: You think You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what ? Nora swallows , trying to seem brave .
NORA: Oh , please . Some people just need some serious rewiring , that 's all . But neither of them are convinced .
KIMBERLY: It 's okay , Dad . I 'm not ten anymore .
MR. BURROUGHS: I 'm sorry . I 'm just so happy that you 're safe .
KIMBERLY: I love you too , Dad . Goodnight .
MR. BURROUGHS: You know , after your mother died Kimberly tenses , bracing for the worst .
KIMBERLY: I used to have those feelings , too . But that 's when I 'd think of Mom . Her strengthand courage . And I 'd pray that maybe I 'd grow up to e as brave as she was . And the ad thoughts would go away .
MR. BURROUGHS: I do n't know what I 'd do if I lost you .
PHYSICIAN: at the request of the patient , you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files , pencils , pens , safety pins , bobby pins , no matches , lighters , belts , elt buckles , earrings , chokers , shoelaces
KIMBERLY: Wait . Is shedangerous o something ?
PHYSICIAN: No honey , but she expects you are .
KIMBERLY: Jesus , how long are you going to keep her locked up this way ?
PHYSICIAN: Depends on her , I guess . She 's voluntary . The door hisses open .
KIMBERLY: Clear Rivers ?
CLEAR: Kimberly Burroughs , eh ? What do you want ?
KIMBERLY: I thoughtI thought you might be able to help me .
CLEAR: Yeah , how ?
KIMBERLY: I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up . .. I saved some people . And now I think Death is after me .
CLEAR: Nice work . Maybe if you 're real lucky , you 'll wind up in here with me . But I doubt you 'll survive that long . Kimberly flinches .
KIMBERLY: It 's not just about me . Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident . What if the others are in danger , too ?
CLEAR: Well , if you put them on the list , they 're already tits up .
KIMBERLY: What list ?
CLEAR: Death 's list . The precise orde you 're going to die in .
KIMBERLY: Exact order ? Then I 'm next ! I was meant to die with my friends , so I 'm next !
CLEAR: But you said someone else died last night . That means Death skipped past you . Someone must have intervened . Sometime yesterday you must have nearly died , but someone saved you . Kimberly nods , recalling the events .
KIMBERLY: Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends .
CLEAR: Congratufuckinglations . That makes you last to go . But do n't worry , once the others are dead , it 'll come back for you . Always does .
KIMBERLY: That still does n't make sense . You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to . But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition , not first .
CLEAR: It 's moving backwards ? Are you sure ?
KIMBERLY: Yes . In my premonition that Nora woman and her kid died first , then Evan and thenmy friends .
CLEAR: Backwardsthat 's new . Clear sees Kimberly crying and softens .
KIMBERLY: Signs ?
CLEAR: If you have the same power as Alex , you 'll be seeing signs soon . When you see anything creepy or ominous , an in-your- face irony kinda thing ? Do n't ignore it . It usually means the difference between life and death .
KIMBERLY: The songs on the radio . But wait . I do n't understand . Why is this even happening to me ?
CLEAR: That 's what Alex used to ask himself right up until
KIMBERLY: It 's obvious you know what you 're talking about . You beat it . You have to help us .
CLEAR: I did n't beat it ; I hid from it . If you were smart you 'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog , because what little life you have left is ove as you know it . Do n't make new friends , do n't fall in love , and do n't ever bother trying to save others . That 's the worst killer of them all .
KIMBERLY: How can you say that ? What kind of monster are you ?
CLEAR: My family is dead . My friends are dead . And Alex
KIMBERLY: Know what ? I think you 're a coward . I think you hide out in here because you 're too damn bitte and selfish to care about anothe
THOMAS: I tried calling last night but you father
KIMBERLY: Evan Shaeffer 's dead .
THOMAS: I know . I 've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp . We 're all meeting at my apartment tonight .
KIMBERLY: Then you believe all this ? ? That Death is working off a list ? Thomas hesitates before answering .
THOMAS: I did n't . Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors .
KIMBERLY: Clean up ? I do n't
KI MBERLY: Did you see that ? ?
KIMBERLY: Pigeons It 's a sign ! If Clear 's ight about the order , then Nora and Tim are going to be attacke d by Pigeons !
THOMAS: I 'm not following you
KIMBERLY: They 're next on the list . We have to find them .
TIM: You think the tooth fairy 's gon na come tonight ? I 'm thinkin ' like fifteen bucks .
NORA: Nice try , kiddo .
TIM: Mom !
NORA: Sure hon . I 'm fine . Let 's shake it , we 're late .
TIM: Not so much . Dr. Lees keeps a skeptical smile to himself .
KIMBERLY: Turn around . The cleaning woman said they 're at the dentist 's . 14th and Main .
THOMAS: Hold on . Thomas expertly skids into a U-turn .
DR. LEES: Jesus . Every day at the same damn time . Now this 'll only sting for a moment .
DR. LEES: How the hell do they expect me to Would you rather have the laughing gas ? Tim nods his head ferociously .
TIM: What are they doing here ? And why are they yelling `` pigeons '' ?
THOMAS: Nora 's not coming . She refuses to leave her son .
KIMBERLY: We have to tell her she 's in danger !
THOMAS: I did . And right now , I do n't think she cares .
KIMBERLY: It 's happening again . It 's fucking
THOMAS: I am too . But you can use that fear . It 'll sharpen you instincts . Keep you alert fro signs . It 's the only way you 'll be able to sav e the othersand me .
KIMBERLY: Clear/Thomas . Thomas/Clear .
CLEAR: I hope you 're ready for this .
KIMBERLY: This is cheery .
THOMAS: Who is this guy , anyway ?
CLEAR: A mortician . He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us .
THOMAS: Should we knock ?
CLEAR: He probably already knows we 're coming .
MORTICIAN: Hello , Clear . I 've been keeping an eye out for you .
KIMBERLY: Oh my God . That 's Evan Shaeffer . Clear , however , seems to expect nothing less .
MORTICIAN: Come to Pick my brain ?
CLEAR: Just a simple question and we 'll leave you alone with your new friend .
MORTICIAN: Fire away .
CLEAR: How do you cheat Death once and fo all ?
MORTICIAN: Dead . But still fresh .
CLEAR: Look , we drove a long way to get here . So if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off ou acks , it sure would be swell if you told us .
MORTICIAN: For what purpose ? You seek a back way out of a room with but one door . You ca n't cheat Death ; there
CLEAR: Bullshit . You told me Death has a distinct design , a blueprint , unalterable . But Alex and I cheated Death not once , but dozens of times . If the design is flawed , it can be beaten .
MORTICIAN: Such fire in you now . People are always most alive just before they die . Do n't you think ?
CLEAR: It can be beaten . And you know it .
MORTICIAN: Some say that there is a balance to everything . An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe . They say that for every lif e there is a death , and fo every death a life
THOMAS: What the hell does that mean ?
MORTICIAN: To figure that out you 'll have to follow the sign s. The Mortician grabs Kimberly .
CLEAR: One last question . Why is Death working backwards this time ?
MORTICIAN: Sorry , time 's up .
THOMAS: New life defeats death ? Follow the signs ? Where the hell did you find that guy ?
KIMBERLY: Yeah , I thought he was supposed to e helpful .
CLEAR: He was . If we can use your ability to see the signs , we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what `` new life '' means . I know , it worries me that I
SKATE RAT: I 'm thinkin ' , suck my junk , bee yatch .
THOMAS: What is it ? What did you see ?
KIMBERLY: II
CLEAR: You 're strong . Do you hear me ? You 're a fucking warrior . Nothing scares you . In fact you happen to e the single most powerful woman on earth . Now what did you see ?
KIMBERLY: I was driving a white van . It must 've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned . It washorrible .
CLEAR: You were there ?
KIMBERLY: I can practically taste the wate in my throat . And something else . The smell of flowers
CLEAR: Then it was n't just a sign . It was a premonition ? Thomas gently releases her , paces .
THOMAS: Remember the onramp ? There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van .
CLEAR: Holy shit . He said `` only new life can defeat death . '' If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born , a brand new soul that was never part of Death 's Design
KIMBERLY: It throws the entire Death list out of whack . And a new list has to be ewritten f rom scratch . We all start over with a clean slate .
THOMAS: It sounds all well and good , but
CLEAR: Please , what else could it mean ?
KIMBERLY: So if you give us the pregnant lady 's number , we can warn he about the lake and she 'll live long enough to have the baby .
CLEAR: So let 's do it .
THOMAS: Shit , I do n't have her number . She was never interviewed . She took off right after the accident .
KIMBERLY: How are we going to find her ? There must be thousands of white vans in this state .
THOMAS: Hey , I 'm a police officer , emember ?
KIMBERLY: Oh God
THOMAS: I , uhsorry .
KIMBERLY: I know , I know . We need my eyes . Clear sits beside Kimberly .
CLEAR: It 's all right . I 'll take watch .
KIMBERLY: I 'm okay . Just caught me by surprise . Put it back on .
CLEAR: Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight .
THOMAS: Taken care of .
KIMBERLY: There it is .
THOMAS: Got it .
CLEAR: I do n't get it . Why is everything happening so fast ? After Flight 180 . A month went by before anyone died . And now five people are dead in less than a day .
THOMAS: Here we go . The vehicle 's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz . And Christ , there 's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two .
CLEAR: We need to hurry . They all get up and leave .
THOMAS: Let 's lay this on her gently now . The stress alone could upset the pregnancy .
JORGE: What ?
THOMAS: I 'm Officer Burke . I 'm looking fo an Isabella Cruz .
JORGE: Shut up ! ! !
THOMAS: Are you Jorge Cruz ?
JORGE: Maybe . What 's this about ?
THOMAS: May we come in ?
JORGE: No . What 's this about ?
THOMAS: It 's about your wife , Isabella . Now is she here ?
JORGE: No . I 'm alone .
THOMAS: Look , pal , it 's probably nothing . But I need to see Jorge is already closing the door .
JORGE: Forget it . You 'll need a warrant . I know , I 'm a lawyer .
YOUNG WOMAN: We never meant to hurt you IsaYou 're not Isabella ! Meanwhile , Jorge yells at Thomas .
JORGE: I 'm going to sue your ass !
KIMBERLY: Whose blood is that on the floor ?
JORGE: Mine , you idiot . The dog went nuts this afternoon . Now arrest her !
KIMBERLY: Where 's Isabella ? Did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater ? Jorge flinches . It 's time to come clean .
JORGE: We had a fight . Some things got oken , the dog went crazy , she left me . Would n't say where she was going .
THOMAS: What was the fight about ?
JORGE: Take a guess .
THOMAS: Does she have a cell phone ? A way we can contact her ?
JORGE: She did . He eyes a SHATTERED CELL PHONE on the floor .
CLEAR: We 're wasting time with this piece of shit . Let 's just get to the meeting .
JORGE: Hey , when you find her , tell he the kid 's half mine .
CLEAR: We can only pray it does n't come out retarded .
MAN: Jesus Christ . I wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin ' bumpers . Rory bends down and inspects his shoe .
RORY: Damn , is that dogshit ?
NORA: Does anybody have a Valium ?
KAT: You 'll want to take Nora pops it in her mouth .
THOMAS: Any word yet on the Dodge van ? Damn .
NORA: So that would mean I 'm next .
EUGENE: Nobody 's next . This is crazy . First death 's stalking us and now premonitions ?
KAT: This ca n't be happening . My career 's at a peak , I finally met a cute guy , I just bought a new house
RORY: Just shut the fuck up and maybe you 'll live .
CLEAR: You 're not next , Nora . Nobody has to be next . That 's the point . Last time , we did n't plan . We were n't organized . Now we can help each other .
KIMBERLY: The point is , as long as you know what to beware of , you have a fighting chance . It can be beaten . If I call you and say subway , get to a high rise fast . A place where no subway could possibly go , get it ?
RORY: Why the hell did I ever get on Route 18 in the first place ? That 's me , Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck .
CLEAR: Anyone read today 's paper ? The article on Evan Shaeffer ? No one says a word .
RORY: That lucky bastard .
CLEAR: What about the rest of you ? Kimberly , you were driving to Daytona . Was Route 18 your first choice ?
KIMBERLY: The new freeway was faster , but Route 18 was the way my mom used to take , so They take turns going around the room .
THOMAS: Route 18 is Drake 's assignment , but he called in sick so I got Drake 's never sick .
KAT: I was my first day of jury duty .
EUGENE: Jury duty ? That 's randomly selected by social security numbers .
CLEAR: Random , sure .
EUGENE: What , you think Death planned fo each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago ? You 're nuts .
RORY: Last July I dialed a wrong numbe and got a radio station by accident . They asked me what number means `` good luck '' in Jewish .
KAT: Eighteen . And it 's `` Hebrew '' .
RORY: Anyway , I guessed it right and won these . Rory holds up two Yankee tickets .
KIMBERLY: I do n't know what 's weirder , the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance .
THOMAS: Whoa , nine months ?
KIMBERLY: Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ?
ISABELLA: Yes , I 'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name ? Isabella Cruz why , does it matter ? I 'm at the Super 8 motel . Yes , I own a white van . So what ? Just get over here .
KIMBERLY: I 'm sorry , Dad , we 're having a hard time with Shaina 's eulogy . I 'll stay here at Virginia 's tonight and see you tomorrow . I love you too .
CLEAR: Remember everyone , just because Kimberly 's got the power does n't mean we 're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent .
RORY: It 's like Forrest Gump .
CLEAR: Fuck . Should have seen that coming . The institution 's made me soft .
EUGENE: If Death has got such a hard-on fo you , maybe you should get the hell away from us .
KIMBERLY: We need her . She 's the only one who 's dealt with this before , idiot !
CLEAR: We 're all going to have to open ou eyes from now on . Look out fo each other . Sleep in shifts . And we 've got to safeproof this deathtrap .
KAT: Screw this . I 'm going outside fo a smoke .
THOMAS: You think you should ? It 's not safe out there .
KAT: So ? Nora 's got ta bite it before me anyway , right ?
KIMBERLY: Where are you going , Nora ? You okay ? Nora fights the sleeve , dazed and defeated .
NORA: Four years ago my husband died . Now Tim . There 's nothing left fo me . Kimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain .
KIMBERLY: Do n't say that . Once you lose hope , it 's already too late .
NORA: If it 's my time to go , to be in heaven with my family , then I can accept that .
KIMBERLY: You ca n't give up . Do n't accept Death 's plan . Trust me , you can fight this . If we can just survive long enough until that baby is orn , we can
NORA: If you 'll excuse me , I have a funeral to prepare .
EUGENE: Yeah , why am I listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house ?
KIMBERLY: Seeing you die once was enough fo me .
EUGENE: Whatever . I control my life , not fate .
CLEAR: I 'll be sure to put that on you tombstone .
RORY: Be careful . And even if you do n't elieve , give this to Nora .
THOMAS: I kinda see it , yeah . SoNora 's going to be killed by a man with hooks ?
EUGENE: Going down , right ? The Gaunt Man says nothing . The DOORS CLOSE .
NORA: Officer Burke ? I ca n't hear
EUGENE: What is it ? What 's wrong ?
NORA: Let me go let me go !
EUGENE: Oh , watch it , you 've caught you uh
MAN: Goodness gracious , darling , let me help you with
KAT: You alright , Nora ?
NORA: My God , someone please let me out of this
EUGENE: no escapes my ass . I control my fate . I die on my terms , hear me Reaper cockscuker ? !
THOMAS: What the hell are you ?
EUGENE: Ai n't going out like that . On my terms !
THOMAS: Just take it easy !
KIMBERLY: You do n't keep it loaded ?
RORY: Maybe they were all duds .
THOMAS: Six in a row ? Never . Impossible . That 's like winning the lottery .
KAT: Can we find the pregnant woman , please ?
EUGENE: Um , Clear ? I 'm sorryabout efore . I
CLEAR: Your entire world view just went out the window . I could n't expect a religious conversation overnight . We 'll get through this . I promise .
RORY: Can I ask you a question ?
KIMBERLY: Sure .
RORY: When I die . Is it gon na hurt ?
KIMBERLY: II do n't know .
RORY: And you 're gon na die after me , ight ?
KIMBERLY: I guess so .
RORY: Would you take these ? And if I die Could you throw all my drugs out ? Paraphernalia , porno , you know Anything that would break my mom 's heart .
THOMAS: A one very pissed off Ms. Isabella Cruz is being detained up in Greenwood . Let 's finish this thing .
RORY: Is this safe , guys ? I mean , someone in this car is about to get whacked . Do the rest of us really feel like sitting next to him ? Or her . Hopefully her . An uncomfortable beat .
THOMAS: Guys , let 's not panic . Isabella 's safe .
KIMBERLY: How do you know ?
THOMAS: You said she was going to drive into a lake . How can she when she 's in protective custody ?
ISABELLA: What do you mean `` grand theft auto ? '' This is insane .
STEVE: Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday mor ning .
ISABELLA: Jorge . When I get out of here I 'm going to sue his cheating ass off .
IS ABELLA: Oh my God .
STEVE: Are you kidding me ? ! Oh , man .
ISABELLA: Take my van !
RORY: Here 's what I do n't get . For nine months , Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the ight time for the pile up
KAT: Yeah ?
RORY: But why single me out ? What am I in the great scheme of things ? You 'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something Fucking weird , man .
THOMAS: You want weird ? Last year , my partner and I were heading out fo the graveyard shift . A call comes in about a train wreck and Frank decides to let me handle it alone .
KAT: I got that beat . So like , last May , I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania . There was a majo gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night .
RORY: Yeah , so what happened ?
KAT: I never mad it . The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop .
CLEAR: Was that in Mt . Abraham ?
KAT: Yeah . How did you know ?
CLEAR: That bus you were on ? It killed Terry Mathers . She was supposed to die on Flight 180 .
KAT: I 'm not sure I
THOMAS: Shit . The call about the train wreck that saved my life ? That was the night I scraped up Billy Hitchcock .
RORY: Who ?
KIMBERLY: Another kid from Flight 180 . A chill passes over the group .
ISABELLA: Promise meI wo n't have the
RORY: Remember the theater in Paris that collapsed last year , killed everyone inside ? Everyone nods , anticipating
CLEAR: Carter .
RORY: Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours . 'Course , missed the show
EUGENE: Are you okay ?
KIMBERLY: A little over a year ago , my mothe and I went to the mall . I was supposed to meet her outside , but I got caught up watching some news eport about some kid who committed suicide . I kept thinking , `` How can you strangle yourself in a athtub ? '' That 's retarded . Thomas mouths , `` Tod ? '' to Clear . Clear nods .
CLEAR: It 's all starting to come together . When Alex got us off Flight 180 , it did n't just change our lives . It
EUGENE: I 'm not sure I understand .
CLEAR: Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death 's design . Eugene nods , slowly getting it .
EUGENE: So if you never got off the plane , none of us would be ali ve in the first place .
CLEAR: That 's why Death is working ackwards . It 's tying up all the loose ends , sealing the rift once and for all ­
STEVE: Hang on !
ISABELLA: Please . It 's not going to wait .
STEVE: I 've got to stop and help those people .
ISABELLA: Do you want to deliver this baby ?
KAT: Not my time . Amazing
THOMAS: Is everybody alright ?
KAT: He ca n't breathe ! He ca n't eathe !
CLEAR: Oh my god , Eugene ! ? Eugene 's head tilts forward , unconscious .
THOMAS: Stop it , do n't move him !
CLEAR: Someone call for help !
KAT: I ca n't move my fucking leg ! Please get me out of here before it explodes !
RORY: Watch it , dude !
KIMBERLY: Help us , we need help over here !
BRIAN: I do n't smell any gas . And none 's dripping , either .
KAT: Stop that ! I still need this foot , thank you .
CLEAR: Be careful with that , check the gages on the regulator and be mindful of overdoses . Oh , watch for potholes and puddles .
PARAMEDIC: Sorry . There 's no room .
THOMAS: Get that over here ! Move move move !
RESCUE WORKER: Excuse me , hot soup coming through .
CLEAR: One more thing . Watch out fo power lines .
THOMAS: Where 's the cell phone Clear gave you ?
RORY: I dunno . I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place .
THOMAS: Damn it . We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn Isabella .
KIMBERLY: You doing alright in there ?
KAT: My legs are starting to cramp up . And God , why am I so thirsty ? Does anyone have any Fiji ?
COP: She 's at Phelps Memorial . They 're prepping her to give birth right now .
THOMAS: Where 's that ?
COP: A few miles up the road . Near the docks .
RESCUE WORKER: Sure , I 'll just set it to the `` quiet '' mode .
THOMAS: We got ta go now . Isabella 's in labor .
KIMBERLY: What about that ?
CLEAR: How you doing in there , hero ?
KAT: I guess it could be worse . Brian hands out drinks to Rescue Workers .
THOMAS: So let 's goWhere the hell is Rory ? !
CLEAR: Get back !
MR. GIBBONS: I did n't mean to do it - I did n't know .
KIMBERLY: It was n't his turn . And it 's not my turn .
MR. GIBBONS: Anything you want . Anything . I wish I knew . I did n't Mr. Gibbons hands Kimberly the keys .
THOMAS: Hurry up . There 's no time . She 's about to give birth .
KIMBERLY: No . If anyone dies from a crash now , it 'll be me . But I ca n't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive . I 'm last on Death 's list .
CLEAR: Are you crazy ? What makes you think you 'd survive ?
KIMBERLY: What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn ?
CLEAR: Six duds in a row .
KIMBERLY: And when it was Rory 's turn to die , and Thomas was in the way ?
THOMAS: That branch fell and saved my life . You 're right , Death 's maintaining the order .
KIMBERLY: Let 's pray that Isabella 's still alive . The truck speeds into the horizon .
STAFF: contractions coming quicker now . Take her pressure and CTG . One centimeter dilation . Prep the epidural stat .
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: She 's going to have to stop moving if I 'm going to The Nurse SNEEZES .
NURSE: Sorry , doctor .
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Perfectly still now
KIMBERLY: This makes no sense . Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake . Could we have altered he destiny when we had her arrested ?
CLEAR: I do n't think so . Alex 's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we
THOMAS: Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can .
CLEAR: If only Alex and I had done that with the others , Alex might still e
THOMAS: Um , Kimberly ? This is a neighborhood . You may wan na slow it down .
KIMBERLY: Do n't worry . Nothing can happen to us .
THOMAS: I was n't worried about us . Suddenly , Kimberly clutches her throat !
CLEAR: Slow down ! We 're
KIMBERLY: No , it 's not here . This one was different . More like the pile up and the van going into the lake . It was n't just a sign , I was there .
CLEAR: Another premonition ?
KIMBERLY: Yes . I was in a hospital . There was screaming A nurse was choking me . I could n't tell wh at she looked like , but the name tag was right in my face . Kalarjian .
THOMAS: Kalarjian ?
KIMBERLY: I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death !
KIMBERLY: Should n't we pull over ?
THOMAS: No time . Keep going . I would n't know how to explain any of this anyway .
KIMBERLY: Oh come on .
CLEAR: Speed up .
KIMBERLY: Yeah , fuck 'em . No offense .
CLEAR: Be alive , Isabella , please be alive .
ORDERLY: Need a pen ? Sure . If you like , I 'll bring crosswords for you , too .
ANCHOR MAN: Good advice , Sue . And stay in school . Up next , Johnny Showers has the weather

RECEPTIONIST: I 'm sorry , I ca n't give out that info unless you 're a relative .

THOMAS: Hurry , I think she 's this way .
RECEPTIONIST: Security ?
OBSTETRICIAN: Listen to me , Isabella , I need you to stop pushing .

OBSTETRICIAN: Isabella , look down and see you son .
CLEAR: A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene .
THOMAS: Do n't sweat it . It 's over .
CLEAR: She had the baby ?
KIMBERLY: New life defeats death . We 've done it . Death has to rewrite the list . We 're safe .
THOMAS: Are you okay ? You just face planted !
KIMBERLY: I know how it feels to be dead .
CLEAR: What did you see ?
KIMBERLY: I was dead . And came back to life . An EEG machine . Where 's Eugene ?
THOMAS: But it 's over . Isabella 's baby was the key . You saw her die and everything , right ?
KIMBERLY: I don'twhat if I made a mistake ?
THOMAS: Impossible . She was on the onramp .
KIMBERLY: I 'm not sure I do n't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up .
THOMAS: Then what 's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean ?
CLEAR: Can you remember anything about it ? Kimberly shuts her eyes , remembering
KIMBERLY: the Same hands from the van . Finally everything makes sense to Clear .
CLEAR: It 's you Kimberly . The premonitions are about you .
KIMBERLY: No ! It ca n't be .
CLEAR: I have to save Eugene !
KIMBERLY: Oh no
ORDERLY: Thanks hon , the Henzels are going crazy for this thing .

DR. KALARJIAN: Doctor Kalarjian . Excuse me , please .
KIMBERLY: Oh my God . That 's it . The lake . The EEG machine . Nurse Kalarjian .
THOMAS: What ?
KIMBERLY: You ca n't cheat destiny . I know what I have to do to save us . I have to die .

KIMBERLY: For God 's sake , leave him alone , Dad .
THOMAS: Yeah , do n't make me cite you fo harassment .
MR. GIBBONS: Oh please . I 'm not hurting anyone . Besides , if you can beat Death ,
THOMAS: Well , technically when we died , we gave Death what it wanted . And by the time we were revived , it had already moved on to grave pastures .

TITA: Yes .
SECOND ENGINEER: I 'd like to remind you again , this is n't an opera or a musical comedy .
TITA: Oh I 'm sorry . Was I singing again ?
SECOND ENGINEER: If you want to call it that .
TITA: Well , you have to simply tell me , that 's all .
SECOND ENGINEER: That 's exactly what I am doing , again .
TITA: Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first ? This is tiring me .
SECOND ENGINEER: I have a suggestion . Why do n't we take a break .
TITA: Oh , for pity 's sake
FIRST ENGINEER: Is she going to cry again ?
TITA: I do n't want to take a break .

TITA: It has absolutely no objectionable idiosyncrasies
BOBBY: Very nice .
TITA: I have to talk seriously with you
BOBBY: Everybody still up on the Island ?
TITA: Well , Herbert 's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra , so at the moment , there 's just Daddy , Carl and myself and Van Oost .
BOBBY: Who 's Van Oost ?
TITA: Catherine she 's a pianist . She 's working with Carl .
BOBBY: Carl 's a fiddler . What 's he doing coaching piano ?
TITA: Well , 11 months ago he was on his icycle , on his way to the post office in La Roche and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck
BOBBY: Sprained his neck ?
TITA: It 's not funny . He permanently sprained his neck , and since then it 's been extremely difficult fo him to tuck the violin .
BOBBY: Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck . That 's Carl
TITA: Robert , I have to tell you something
BOBBY: What ?
TITA: Daddy 's very ill .
BOBBY: Oh , well , what , what 's he
TITA: He 's had two strokes .
BOBBY: Do n't tell me about this
TITA: But do n't you think it 's right , though , that you should see him , at least once
BOBBY: Yeah I guess so
TITA: I 'm going back up tonight . Will you go with me ?
BOBBY: No
TITA: I know .
BOBBY: Well I better let you
TITA: Wait
BOBBY: Maybe you better stay , then .
TITA: No , I need to talk to you , about so many things
BOBBY: Well , I 'll be seeing you in a couple of days , wo n't I ?
TITA: Oh God , I 'm so glad , Robert , that you 're coming
BOBBY: Yeah , me , too
TITA: It 'll be so good for you , and fo Daddy , because you know , you 've never really
BOBBY: Tita , I 've got to go
TITA: All right
BOBBY: Hello ? !
RAYETTE: You 'll be gone , period .
BOBBY: I 'll try and call you from up there .
BOBBY: Do you want to go with me , Ray ?
RAYETTE: `` There 's been hot spells/An ' cold spells ever since we met/I 've seen your small fires/Your big fires/But I wo n't give up yet/Oh someday you 'll yearn/'Cause your heart 's gon na burn/For that old familia glow/You 'll be burned ''
BOBBY: I love it .
RAYETTE: `` You 'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An ' come back to me , I know ''
BOBBY: What the hell is that ?
RAYETTE: Is it an accident ?
BOBBY: Hey ! What 's going on , what 's the trouble ? !
PALM: Rotate , mack !
RAYETTE: What 'd she say ?
PALM: Look at my car ! Piece of shit ! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot , and the steering goes to the pot on me !
BOBBY: You 're lucky no one was hurt .
PALM: Seven hundred dollars , down the toilet ! I 'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out ! Can you give us a lift ?
RAYETTE: Jesus , what a rude person
BOBBY: What 's your name ?
PALM: Palm Apodaca .
RAYETTE: An ' what 's your name ?
TERRY: Terry Grouse .
BOBBY: What ?
RAYETTE: I 'll tell you l-a-t-e-r .
PALM: How far are you going to ?
BOBBY: Washington .
PALM: We 'll get off in Washington and hook another ride .
BOBBY: Where are you going ?
PALM: Alaska .
BOBBY: Alaska ? Are you on vacation ?
TERRY: She wants to live there , because she thinks it 's cleaner .
BOBBY: Cleaner than what ?
PALM: You do n't have to tell everybody about it . Pretty soon they 'll all go there and it wo n't be so clean .
BOBBY: How do you know it 's clean ?
PALM: I saw a picture of it . Alaska is very clean . It appeared to look very white to me Do n't you think ?
BOBBY: Yeah . That 's before the big thaw .
PALM: Before the what ?
PALM: I had to leave this place . I got depressed , seeing all the crap . And the thing is , they 're making more crap , you know ? They 've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap , I ca n't believe it .
BOBBY: Who ?
PALM: Who ? People , that 's who ! Pretty soon there wo n't be room fo anyone . They 're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine . Oofh ! Crap ! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it .
RAYETTE: There 'd never be a hole big enough . Now took at me , for instance , when I was just one person , before Bobby , I had so much garbage collectin ' onto me every day , I was thinkin ' about gettin a dispose all
PALM: A dispose-all , what 's that but more crap ? I 've never seen such crap . Oofh , I do n't know how people get up in the morning .
TERRY: Mass production is what does it .
PALM: What do you mean `` mass '' I have to come out and tell you , you 're not that clean , either .
TERRY: Wait a minute . I 'm not that neat , maybe , but I am clean .
PALM: Well , you 're not that bad , but some people I mean , people 's homes , just filth . I 've been in people 's homes
TERRY: In my personal observation , I think that more people are neat than are clean
PALM: In my personal thing , I do n't see that . I 'm seeing more filth . A lot of filth . What they need to do every day , no , once in a while , is a cockroach thing , where they spray the homes . And uh can you imagine , if their doors were painted a pretty color , and they had a pot outside , with
TERRY: Yeah , it could be adorable
PALM: And they picked up ! I mean , it would n't be filthy , with Coke ottles and whiskey , and those signs everywhere
BOBBY: Well
PALM: It 's just filthy . People are dirty . I think that 's the biggest thing that 's wrong with people . I think they would n't be as violent if they were clean , because then they would n't have anybody to pick on Oofh Dirt
RAYETTE: Well
PALM: Not dirt . See , dirt is n't bad . It 's filth . Filth is bad . That 's what starts maggots and riots
RAYETTE: That 's an old maid 's tale .
PALM: Bullshit ! Truck drivers know the est eating places on the road .
RAYETTE: Salesmen and cops are the ones . If you 'd ever waitressed , honey , you 'd know .
PALM: Do n't call me `` honey , '' mack .
RAYETTE: Do n't call me `` mack , '' honey .
PALM: I would n't be a waitress . They 're nasty and full of crap .
RAYETTE: You better hold onto your tongue !
PALM: Hold onto this .
RAYETTE: Just one minute , you ! Do n't you ever talk to me like that !
BOBBY: Shut up ! All of you !
WAITRESS: No substitutions .
BOBBY: What does that mean ? You do n't have any tomatoes ?
WAITRESS: No . We have tomatoes .
BOBBY: But I ca n't have any . Is that what you mean ?
WAITRESS: Only what 's on the menu A Number Two Plain omelette . It comes with cottage fries and rolls .
BOBBY: I know what it comes with , but that 's not what I want .
WAITRESS: I 'll come back when you 've made up your mind
BOBBY: Wait , I 've made up my mind . I want a plain omelette , forget the tomatoes , do n't put potatoes on the plate , and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee .
WAITRESS: I 'm sorry , we do n't have side orders of toast . I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll .
BOBBY: What do you mean , you do n't have side orders of toast ? You make sandwiches , do n't you ?
WAITRESS: Would you like to talk to the manager ?
PALM: Hey , mack !
BOBBY: Shut up . You have bread , do n't you , and a toaster of some kind ?
WAITRESS: I do n't make the rules .
BOBBY: Okay , I 'll make it as easy for you as I can . Give me an omelette , plain , and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast no butter , no mayonnaise , no lettuce and a cup of coffee .
WAITRESS: One Number Two , and a chicken sal san hold the butter , the mayo , the lettuce and a cup of coffee Anything else ?
BOBBY: Now all you have to do is hold the chicken , bring me the toast , charge me for the sandwich , and you have n't broken any rules .
WAITRESS: You want me to hold the chicken .
BOBBY: Yeah . I want you to hold it between your knees .
WAITRESS: You see that sign , sir ? !
BOBBY: You see this sign ?
PALM: Fantastic ! That you could figure all that out , and lay that down on her , to come up with a way you could get your toast .
BOBBY: I did n't get it , did I ?
PALM: No , but it was very clever I would of just punched her out .
PALM: Except monkeys do things out in the open that I do n't go for .
PALM: I was in this place once , this store , with snakes , monkeys , everything you could imagine . I walked in , I had to run out . It stunk ! They did n't even have an incense going
TERRY: Steam .
PALM: Right , steam . A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink . But do you know , they will not even let us have it . Can you believe it ? Why ? ! Man ! He likes to create a stink . I wrote them a note once , and told them to clean it I mean , do n't you see that ? It 's just filthy ! I mean , I 've seen filth you would n't believe ! Oofh , what a stink ! I do n't even want to talk about it
RAYETTE: Are you depressed about your daddy , honey ?
BOBBY: No .
RAYETTE: I 'magine it 's me then , id ' n it ?
BOBBY: Is what you ?
RAYETTE: You 're depressed that I come along .
BOBBY: Who said I was depressed ?
RAYETTE: Well , is that a happy face I see ?
BOBBY: Oh , you 're not going to kill yourself this time . I wish I 'd known
RAYETTE: I do n't know if I 'm gon na be able to sleep or not .
BOBBY: If you just would n't open you mouth , everything would be fine .
RAYETTE: Tick a lock .
BOBBY: I have to see how things are first . My father 's sick , you understand ? They would n't be prepared for me inging anyone .
RAYETTE: So how long am I supposed to sit an ' twiddle my thumbs in this place ?
BOBBY: If you ca n't do what I ask , Ray , use that money to go back home , then .
RAYETTE: Bobby , do n't talk like that
BOBBY: Okay , Ray
RAYETTE: Or maybe sit out by the pool an ' get myself nice an ' tan for you . Would you like that ?
BOBBY: Sure
RAYETTE: It brings out my eyes
BOBBY: Bye , honey , I 'll call you in a couple of days .
RAYETTE: Okay
BOBBY: He does n't even know who the hell I am .
TITA: Remember , Bobby , what mother used to say when
CATHERINE: How long have you been Oh , excuse me
TITA: No , it 's all right , you go ahead
CATHERINE: I was just going to ask Robert how long he 's been away from here .
BOBBY: Four or five years .
CARL: No , the last time was three years ago .
TITA: Oh no , it 's been much more than that .
CARL: Away from the piano , Tita , you have no sense of time at all .
TITA: I do n't think that 's true .
CARL: It is true .
TITA: Besides being very rude .
CATHERINE: What have you been doing since then ?
BOBBY: What have I been doing ? Different things , different jobs , here and there . Nothing that interesting .
CATHERINE: And you no longer play at all ?
CARL: You know , just after I came back off tour with the Betenthalle Quartet , Dad , myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you
TITA: Oh , my , `` a summit conference . '' I wonder where I was , polishing silver behind the coal bin .
CARL: I do n't know where you were , penis envy .
TITA: I hope I did n't hear that .
CARL: At any rate , Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out , and I said , `` What for ? '' Whatever the hell he 's doing , even if it 's a completely wasteful escapade , it 's entirely his usiness . Simple as that
BOBBY: Well , I really appreciate it , Carl .
TITA: I do n't think you should infe Daddy was wrong in front of him
BOBBY: How long have you been staying here ?
TITA: A couple of months .
CARL: Did you hear about my misfortune , Robert ?
BOBBY: What ?
CARL: It 's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck . If I wanted to turn toward Catherine , fo instance , I 'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around like this
CATHERINE: I would n't mind doing a little work , if you 're finished , and not too tired
CARL: No , I 'm finished Satiety is my father and mother .
BOBBY: Is she ?
CATHERINE: Excuse me , I do n't want to hea this
CARL: I hope you feel at home , Robert . I 'm really glad you 're here .
BOBBY: Thanks , Carl
TITA: He has ways of communicating , Robert . I can tell when he 's expressing approval or disapproval , just from his eyes
BOBBY: Uhm hmm . Some range .
TITA: It 's not that bad .
BOBBY: Yes , it is . I ca n't take seeing him , sitting there like a stone .
TITA: A week or two is n't going to ruin your life , for Godsakes .
BOBBY: No , I do n't . You should 've left a long time ago .
TITA: We ca n't all get up and leave , can we ? I mean , there are certain needs you have to respond to
BOBBY: What questions ?
TITA: Well , do you I mean , have you enjoyed all these strange things you 've been doing ?
BOBBY: Sometimes .
TITA: No , no , I do n't think that , I 'm just curious about it Do you think I 'm a freak ?
BOBBY: Sort of .
TITA: Oh no Why ? What is it ? The way I look ?
BOBBY: No , I do n't really think you 're a freak .
TITA: I probably am , but I do n't care . I mean , I was n't that blessed to egin with , and when would I have had time to make any improvements
BOBBY: What about Carl and Catherine ? Is he just coaching her , or what ?
TITA: Constantly . Night and day . And unless I get up before the birds , I ca n't get in any practice time fo myself
BOBBY: Uhm hmm .
TITA: Actually , it 's very admirable , the way she works . She 'll probably be enormously successful , because she 's attractive as well , not that that 's so important in music , ut
BOBBY: You 're attractive , Tita . If you just did a little more with yourself
TITA: Like what ?
BOBBY: Well , if you just maybe did something with your hair , or
TITA: Oh , let 's not talk about my hair , it does what it wants to , and anyway , who cares , I want to talk about you
BOBBY: There 's nothing to say , Tita
TITA: Well , you 're not going to run out on me right away , are you ?
BOBBY: I do n't know .
TITA: Oh God , do n't sneak up on me like that !
BOBBY: Sorry .
CATHERINE: Hello
BOBBY: I guess you fell in the water .
CATHERINE: Yes , intentionally .
BOBBY: That 's dangerous , you know .
CATHERINE: Swimming ?
BOBBY: Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water . You could get a cramp .
CATHERINE: I love to swim , and I do n't mind the cold at all . It 's invigorating .
BOBBY: Well , I would n't want to get too invigorated myself .
CATHERINE: Why ?
BOBBY: What would I do with it ? Run amok ?
CATHERINE: Well , there 's fishing and boating . There 's concerts on the mainland and but I feel silly telling you . This is really your home . You probably know better than I what there is to do .
BOBBY: Nothing .
CATHERINE: Nothing ? Then it must be very oring for you here .
BOBBY: That 's right . Have you anything to suggest ?
CATHERINE: I do n't know . Let me give it some thought .
BOBBY: What 're you doing right now
CATHERINE: Right now I 'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself .
BOBBY: Then after that ?
CATHERINE: After that , I plan to read some music and rest for awhile .
BOBBY: Tomorrow , then .
CATHERINE: Tomorrow 's a full practice day But the day after is kind of open .
BOBBY: The day after tomorrow .
CATHERINE: If you 're free .
BOBBY: Yeah , I 'll probably be free .
TITA: Do n't laugh
CARL: I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach .
CATHERINE: One thing that 's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music , and then just walk away from it , without a second thought
BOBBY: I gave it a second thought .
TITA: He looks tired to me , Spicer . I think you should put him to bed .
CATHERINE: I mean , how could you not play anymore ? That 's so strange to me
BOBBY: I have played a few times . Here and there . As a matter of fact , I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue .
CATHERINE: You do n't call that music , though .
BOBBY: Of course I do . It 's music . You know
CARL: Robert , do you mind ?
BOBBY: What ?
CARL: Nothing . Will you excuse us for a while ?
CATHERINE: We really do n't have to , Carl , if you 're not feeling good
CARL: Well , maybe if we put the Thermaphore on me for a while , first
CATHERINE: Oh , all right .
TITA: Do you want some gingerbread ?
BOBBY: What ?
TITA: With applesauce ?
BOBBY: No , thanks
BOBBY: Yeah , well fine , you know what I suggest , Ray Because I do n't know how long . Things are not going that well here
CARL: Only 10 minutes of playing and it 's already killing my neck
BOBBY: You sure you should be playing , Carl ?
CARL: What do you mean ? Aside from my neck , I 'm in superb shape .
BOBBY: I do n't know , there 's something wrong with the way you move .
CARL: I 'm not aware of it . Like what ?
BOBBY: Your serve . Two Eighteen .
CARL: I 've walked across a stage a numbe of times , without exciting any particular response
BOBBY: That 's what I mean
CARL: Any particular humor , I meant .
BOBBY: I think you should get someone to coach you how to walk . I think it 's a substantial problem .
CARL: Dammit !
BOBBY: Look at that .
TITA: Why are you being so mean ?
BOBBY: I 'm not . He does walk funny . Do n't you see that ?
TITA: I do n't think I 'd notice . I 'm so used to Carl .
BOBBY: Yeah , well , he 's
TITA: Bobby ? Do you think Spicer is attractive ?
BOBBY: I think he 's got a terrific personality .
TITA: You know , he was formerly a sailor .
BOBBY: Look , ca n't you see that , what I 'm talking about ?
TITA: Sailors are sadistic , I feel .
CARL: See ? There 's nothing wrong with the way I walk . Now where are we ?
BOBBY: At game , Carl .
CARL: All right , let 's have a rematch .
BOBBY: I thought you had to go to the mainland today . Are n't you going to miss the ferry ?
CARL: Too bad . Just when I was hitting my stride .
TITA: Can I play now ?
CARL: Tell her I 'll be back sometime tomorrow !
BOBBY: Where is she , anyway ?
TITA: My turn .
BOBBY: Why do n't you and Spicer play ?
CATHERINE: That was beautiful , Robert . I 'm surprised
BOBBY: Thank you .
CATHERINE: I was really very moved by the way you
BOBBY: It was n't supposed to be , it just struck me that way .
CATHERINE: Why ?
BOBBY: Nothing . It 's just that I picked the easiest piece I could remember . I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it etter then .
CATHERINE: It does n't matter . It was the feeling I was affected by .
BOBBY: I did n't have any .
CATHERINE: You had no inner feeling ?
BOBBY: None .
CATHERINE: Then I must have been supplying it .
BOBBY: Wait
CATHERINE: Well , at least you 're accomplished at something
BOBBY: What ?
CATHERINE: At being a fake .
BOBBY: Catherine
CATHERINE: No , you 're very good at it . I 'm eally impressed .
BOBBY: Shit .
CATHERINE: I think it 's what you think .
BOBBY: No , it is n't what I think .
CATHERINE: Look You made a very calculated move , and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you . That was n't necessary .
BOBBY: Yes , it was . You 've made it clea that if I can cut a little piano , I might get a little response .
CATHERINE: I do n't think that 's accurate
BOBBY: Up to now , what I 've been getting from you are meaningful looks ove the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day afte tomorrow
CATHERINE: I 'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks . And as for the day after tomorrow , this is the day after tomorrow , and I am , unfortunately , seeing you Now if you 'll excuse me , I 'd like to take a bath .
BOBBY: It 's convenient to fake looking fo something right now , is n't it ?
CATHERINE: I 'm not faking anything . I 'm looking for some bath oil
BOBBY: Some bath oil ?
CATHFRINE: What are you doing !
BOBBY: What are you doing , screwing around with this crap ? !
CATHERINE: I do n't find your language that charming .
BOBBY: It 's direct , anyway , which seems to e difficult for you .
CATHERINE: I 'd like you to leave now . Is that direct enough ?
BOBBY: Serious , that 's what 's important to you ?
CATHERINE: Yes , that 's what 's important to me
BOBBY: Okay , let 's be serious
CATHERINE: No , do n't do that
BOBBY: Shut up
CATHERINE: No inner feeling .
BOBBY: That 's right .
CATHERINE: I do n't believe vou .
BOBBY: That 's what you said ?
CATHERINE: Something witty and devastating like that .
BOBBY: I 'm fine .
CATHERINE: Carl restored my confidence . He eally did . He 's much more substantial than you give him credit for .
BOBBY: Is he ?
CATHERINE: Yes .
BOBBY: Yeah , I think I could .
CATHERINE: Robert ?
BOBBY: What ?
CATHERINE: I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning , before Carl comes ack , I mean , if you 'd like to .
BOBBY: Of course I 'd like to .
RAYETTE: You certainly do have a beautiful piece a real estate out here , Mr. Dupea .
TITA: He 's not hard of hearing .
RAYETTE: Well , that 's a blessing , at least .
BOBBY: I do n't know .
CARL: You 've been staying in a motel all this time ?

SAMIA: But the point is , man is born into the world with a pre-existent adversary , both real and imaginary , so you 'd have to say that aggression was one of his primary , psychic inheritances , which
FINCHER: If I may beg to differ
SAMIA: Beg all you like , John , but the fact remains that man takes enormous delight in aggressive acts , as well as the portrayal of aggressive acts , and to be triumphant over another no matte how , seems fundamental to his having a sense of well being , as well as
FINCHER: No , I do n't quarrel with you inference , but you draw too long a ow in your conclusions , which seem unnecessarily harsh and

RAYETTE: Is there a TV in the house ?
SAMIA: John believes in the basic goodness of man , and that 's fine , but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific . And not unlike television , it hardly epresents the real world
RAYETTE: There 's some good things on it , though .
SAMIA: Pardon me ?
RAYETTE: The TV . There 's some good things on it , sometimes .
SAMIA: I strongly doubt it , but I was n't eally discussing media
FINCHER: If you really hold such bleak views , how can you , in good conscience , carry on a practice ?
SAMIA: Oh , there 's always hope , I think , for a few individuals , if they 're courageous enough to shed thei illusions and their
CATHERINE: And what about love ?
SAMIA: What about it ? Would n't you agree that a great deal of mischief has een done in the name of love ?
CATHERINE: No , I would n't .
SAMIA: Well , you 're a romantic , Catherine , as are most musicians , and what 's more , about to be married
SAMIA: which should exclude you from any objective discussion . But keep in mind , even the arts are n't free of aggressive content , nor the institution of marriage .
CATHERINE: I think these cold , `` objective '' discussions are aggressive , Samia
SAMIA: But I 'd like to say , so that I do n't dampen the spirit of you adventure
CATHERINE: You have n't dampened my spirit , Samia Excuse me .

ARMORED MAN: Gladly !
MING: Fall on your sword .
ZARKOV: You inhuman fiend !
MING: Of course I 'm `` inhuman '' ! that 's a compliment ! Pathetic Earthlings , forever wondering if you are alone in the universe eaming you plaintive messages into to the void for anything that might hear you even hurling your bodies out into it and all without the faintest inkling of who or what is out here . If you had known anything anything at all about the true nature of the universe , you would have hidden from it , in terror !
DALE: Watch it , fella you came with me !
MING: You know who Ming is now who are you and why do you come to Mongo ?
FLASH: I 'm Flash Gordon of the New York Giants this is Dale Arden Dr.Zarkov hijacked us in an effort to save

MING: Come closer , Dale Arden let me see you .
KLYTUS: This woman will amuse you .
ZARKOV: Klytus can see the future , eh ?
MING: He can foresee it but for a few moments only . It gives him a unique gift for survival , and treachery .
ZARKOV: Extraordinary . I 'd like to study his beta factors I wager I could extend them with a course of telekinetic exercise . Tell me when you use this fit does your temporal lobe prickle ? Here ?
MING: Chain this one up . Preserve him fo further examination .
LEADER: Hail , Ming !

AURA: Catch your breath then I 'll take you up and find you a disguise .
FLASH: You 're saving my life . How can I Thank you ?
AURA: I 'll fly you to the forest of Arboria - we 'll find a way .
FLASH: Let 's get one thing straight I 've got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov too rescue them and try to save Earth too .
AURA: Do you realize how foolish you are to tell that to me Ming 's daughter ?
FLASH: I 'm no good at lying .
AURA: You 're funny are all Eathlings like you , Flash Gordon ?
PLASH: I guess I 'm about average .
ZARKOV: Incredible - the very core of this planet , is it not ?
SOLDIER: We are but soldiers . We do not know .
MING'S VOICE: You guess well , Dr. Zarkov ! ZARKOV wheels in his chains , looks up .
MING: I am forcing this plasma through the successive nuclear phases of a star - uilding it toward the apocalyptic moment that will end Earth 's pathetic history in one flash of fire .
ZARKOV: Devil ! Why do n't you turn this science to peaceful use ? The name Ming would e blessed instead of cursed .
MING: Bring him up to the dome , Soldiers we wish to show him wonders .
EVERYONE: Hail ! Ming ! Hail , Great one Without Mercy !
FLASH: Listen , where 's he got Dale ?
AURA: Forget Dale Arden !
FLASH: I ca n't ! I mean I hardly know her ,

FLASH: Those are ROCKET SHIPS in there ! I ca n't fly a damn rocket ship !
AURA: Learn from me I 'll teach you so much !
ZARKOV: Earth !
MING: Yes , Zarkov as it was . Now as it will be , when my plasma reaches full force..
ZARKOV: But that 's impossible ! Even you perverted genius ca n't create new life !
MING: Of course I can create life . There 's nothing easier . It only requires myself and one woman .
SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING: Dale Arden..
MING: Who else ? As in that childish myth of yours Adam and Eve , was n't it ? I will breed with her and repopulate the Earth in my own image . I 've already done it on over a thousand planets .
ZARKOV: Monster ! MING laughs , makes a sign to a SOLDIER .
MING: Return him to the dungeon .
HEDONIA: Drink this . DALE recoils , her giggling cut short .
DALE: What is it some rotten drug ?
HEDONIA: It has no name . But many brave men died to bring it across space from Cythera , planet of Pleasure . It will make your hours with Ming more agreeable .
DALE: Flash ! Where are you ? ?
FLASH: Some lucky people live on that one too ?
AURA: Of course - the Sand Men . Every Moon is a kingdom seperate and hostile to all the others . They have nothing in common but Ming 's ule and their hatred of him .
FLASH: Why do n't they team up and fight him ?
AURA: Fight Ming the Merciless ?
LAUGHS: You saw what happened to the Lizard Men .
FLASH: Sue but that was n't a team effort .
AURA: I do n't know these words what 's a `` team '' ?
FLASH: Why ?
AURA: Because he does anything I ask . He loves me .
FLASH: You can really transfer your thoughts with that ? Like I could get in touch with Dale ?
AURA: If I showed you how .
TEASING: But I 'm not going to .
FLASH: Please .
AURA: What are you doing ?
AURA: Are you mad > We 're diving straight at Ardentia !
FLASH: That 's right , Princess ··· and we 're not pulling out until you put that gadget over my head and tune me in to Dale Arden !
HEDONIA: Rub this on your body . It gives Ming pleasure .
FLASH'S VOICE: Dale , it 's me Flash ! Am I with you ?

DALE'S VOICE: Sounds like fourth down and about ninety yards to go , but I 'll try .
FLASH'S VOICE: Dale , you 're some girl God , you eally are .
PAUSE: Do you get what I 'm thinking now ?
DALE'S VOICE: Oh yes .

TREE MAN: Barin got him !

AURA: It means nothing . They only shout that because it 's treason not to . They hate Ming .
BARIN: I scent a Tiger Man near the lodge ! Form battle lines above and below !

BARIN: Not him ! Bring him back for sport
BARIN: Aura !
AURA: It 's so long since I 've been with you , Barin I could n't stand it . Please do n't be too angry at me fo coming .
BARIN: Angry at you ? BARIN laughs .
AURA: I 've dreamed of it !
BARIN: Get me a sword This is the fiercest Tiger Man we have ever hunted . I 'm going to kill him now and dedicate his blood to you , my beloved .
AURA: But that 's treason ! Blood can be dedicated to Ming alone !
BARIN: I know you , Aura the more a man isks , the greater your passion . If I knew a greater risk , I 'd take it .
AURA: Flash Gordon come out !
FLASH: I 'm from Earth , Prince Barin . My friends and I were Ming 's prisoners . She kindly brought me here to enlist your help .
BARIN: What in hell ? My help ?

BARIN: I 'll hide him , all right unde six feet of Arborian dirt !
FLASH: I 'm not your enemy , Prince Barin . we share a hatred of Ming
AURA: Are you so afraid of my Earthling , Barin ; Wo n't you even give him a chance ?
BARIN: Snake keeper ! Rouse your beast !
CU FLASH: 45 .
FLASH: I think I 'll pass on this one .
BARIN: There are six openings to the serpent . Five are safe the sixth is death . Choose one or take your end from my sword here and now .
AURA: I 'll do that .
FLASH: What the hell ? Forget it . Sending that message by you is like sending a lettuce-leaf by a rabbit . BARIN 'S sword touches FLASH 'S back .
AURA: If your love for me is great enough , Barin , surely it will protect you from the serpent no ?
BARIN: Go again .
FLASH: What are you waiting for ?
BARIN: Fooled you , did n't I ? AURA laughs , turns her smile on FLASH .
AURA: It 's an even chance now , Flash Gordon that 's better than Daddy would have given you
FLASH: Boy . You oughta be handled with a forked stick yourself .
BARIN: If I were you , I 'd choose the sword
AURA: Maybe I was wrong surely the Prince of Arboria would n't be beaten by a toy .
BARIN: The hunt 's on , my Tree Men !
TREE MEN: To the hunt with Barin !
TIGER MAN: Thank you for freeing me .
FLASH: You can speak ?
TIGER MAN: For all the good it does me .
FLASH: Have we a chance , Tiger Man ?
TIGER MAN: Only if we climb out of the green light to the sky Prince Barin 's Tree Men ca n't follow us up there !
FLASH: What do you mean ?
TIGER MAN: Ming 's Law outside his own kingdom , every hunter becomes the hunted !
FLASH: Damn . End of the line .
TIGER MAN: I do n't know no man has ever been above the green .
TREE MAN: The sight call came from the left !
BARIN: Up and across we 'll cut them off !
TIGER MAN: What is that color above ?
FLASH: Blue . We call is blue .
TIGER MAN: Legend says Arboria ends in an ocean to the west .
BARIN: I saved you because your death must e mine .

DOCTOR: I 'm Doctor Kenan and the good news is that you are in good condition . You did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of lurred vision and a headache . You have numerous lacerations around your left eye . We 're going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution . But it seems your eye is OK. MRI 's show strained tendons in your left knee and ankle but you did n't break any bones .
WHIP: I remember everything until the crash .
CHARLIE: Apparently she was n't strapped in . A survivor reported that she was assisting a kid .
WHIP: How 's Margaret Thomason ?
CHARLIE: Broken collar bone , cuts , banged up , but she 's okay . She 's here too . Ken Evans your copilot took a ad shot to the head . They 're keepin ' him in a coma to let the ain swelling go down . He 's listed as critical , but we feel good about him . He 's gon na be okay .
WHIP: Charlie , why are you here ?
CHARLIE: I 'm flying a desk now . I 'm a egional rep for the IAP .
WHIP: You 're the rep for the pilots ' union ?
CHARLIE: I 'm one of a few union reps for the southeast . When your plane went down all the reps got a page and since I know you I shot my hand up and said I wanted to come and be the first face you 'd see .
WHIP: I 'm glad it 's you .
CHARLIE: It 's good to see you too , Cowboy . You 're gon na be okay . We 're gon na take care of you . That 's my job .

WHIP: 15 .

WHIP: Thanks Charlie , I really It means a lot to me that you came .

WHIP: Thank you .
NICOLE: Were you on the plane ?
WHIP: Yeah , I was . Were you ? Nicole shakes her head .
NICOLE: Where were you sitting ?
WHIP: Up near the front .
SILENCE: Joke . You guys in the plane crash ?
NICOLE: He was .
WHIP: Yeah , I 'm lucky . Goin ' home tomorrow .
NICOLE: Nicole .
SHE SMILES: Do you think you 're gon na die ? NICOLE laughs to keep from weeping .
WHIP: I do n't know her .
NICOLE: Chemo brain . Chemo makes you pretty foggy .
WHIP: Yeah ?
NICOLE: They call it chemo brain , my mom used to slur her words and get all chatty .
WHIP: Your mom had cancer .
NICOLE: Breast cancer , she was only 54 . It 's quiet .
WHIP: But why 'd that guy ask you if you were gon na die ?
NICOLE: I dunno . I flat-lined twice in the ambulance . Heroin addicts who use needles tend to die . Especially women for some reason .
WHIP: Is that right ?
NICOLE: I have a pamphlet to prove it . A girl from AA just came to see me
IT'S QUIET: That guy was a trip . He made it feel like , I dunnowe were the last people left on the planet.. and together we should save the world .
WHIP: Well , where should we live ? If we 're gon na save the world , where should we do that ? NICOLE laughs .
NICOLE: You do n't want me . WHIP laughs .

NICOLE: Why you wan na come visit ? It 's luxurious . I live in Bankhead , it 's south Atlanta , near the bus station .

WHIP: No . I 'm gon na go to the farm .
HARLING MAYS: The fucking farm ?
WHIP: My dad 's place . I ca n't stay at my condo .
HARLING MAYS: I thought you sold that fucking place .
WHIP: Not yet .
HARLING MAYS: I 'm not sure I wan na stay at the farm .
WHIP: You 're not . Just take me to the airport to get my car .
HARLING MAYS: 58 Veal ? Really ? Do n't you know the 58 first place every two-bit thief looks is in the freezer ?
CELL PHONE: You have 127 messages .
A BEEP: Message one '' Captain Whitaker , this is Jim Court I 'm with CNN . We 'd like to schedule an interview '' Message two '' This is NBC affiliate KGAT in Athens we 're looking to contact William J. Whitaker for '' Message three '' Captain Whitaker , this is Karen James , media elations with the pilots ' union ''
VOICE MAIL: I think that was the beep . Hey Cowboy , it 's Charlie again .
CHARLIE: I 'm back in town and I stopped by the hospital tonight but they said you went homeso I guess you 're feelin ' pretty good , but um we went out to your condo and the manage said you had not returned .
VOICE MAIL: Soyou may be with relatives , which I understand . I was really hoping to see you for breakfast . I 'm at the St. Regis downtown .
CHARLIE: Whip , hey buddy . Glad you got my message . Grab a seat . WHIP studies HUGH as he pulls out his chair .
HUGH: Nice to meet you Captain Whitaker .
CHARLIE: Siddown . Coffee ? Miss , can we get some fresh coffee ?
WHIP: God landed the plane ?
CHARLIE: I too believe that God landed that plane . The same way I believe that God should hit the buffet , the turkey sausage is excellent .
WHIP: I 'm good with coffee .
CHARLIE: Len Caldwell was really trying to get here this morning . Len is the president of the pilots ' union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash site . So..
WHIP: They find the flight data ecorders ?
CHARLIE: Yes they found them , perfectly intact .
WHIP: Great . That solves everything . The recorders will tell the story . Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago ?
CHARLIE: Hugh 's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence-
WHIP: Criminal negligence ?
HUGH: Death demands responsibility . Six dead on that plane , someone has to pay .
WHIP: The plane fell apart at 30 thousand feet .
CHARLIE: The airline will try to prove equipment failure . Which would make the manufacturer responsible . The manufacturer of the plane will try to prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline .
HUGH: Or pilot error .
WHIP: I had to fly that plane inverted , that means upside down , Hugh . Do you get the picture ? 100 passengers hanging upside down , 500 feet off the ground . Do you have any idea what that sounds like ?
HUGH: I do . I heard the black box last night .
WHIP: Are you a pilot ?
HUGH LANG: No I 'm not .
WHIP: Then you do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about .
CHARLIE: Hugh 's on our team and it 's the NTSB 's ball game . They run the investigation and they will ultimately rule on the cause .
HUGH: They interview the entire flight crew and the passengers . They hold
WHIP: Charlie , what do I need to know ? I 'm already tired of this guy .
HUGH: The NTSB ` go team ' collects blood , skin and hair from the flight crew for a toxicology report .
WHIP: When did they do that ?
HUGH: In the hospital . It 's the first thing they do . Do you remembe having your blood drawn on the night of the crash ? WHIP looks at CHARLIE and then to HUGH
WHIP: Do they have the results of these lood tests ?
HUGH: Yeah , they do . The WAITRESS checks in .
WAITRESS: Anything else for you gentlemen ?
WHIP: Did I just see warm cinnamon rolls come out ?
WAITRESS: Yes sir .
WHIP: Bring me one wouldya ? Actually ing me two , okay sweetie ?
WAITRESS: Comin ' up .
HUGH: An initial report shows alcohol in your bloodstream at a level of .24 . In the U.S .
WHIP: What does that mean ? I had a bee the night before I flew . And whatThat made the tail of the plane explode ?
CHARLIE: Separate issues Whip-
WHIP: I need a lawyer .
CHARLIE: Hugh is your lawyer .
WHIP: I need a bigger lawyer . A lawye who understands that I flew a oken plane and without me at that stick there 'd be 102 funerals , not
HUGH: We 're talking about prison not funerals . Somebody has-
WHIP: To write checks , well it 's not me I promise you that . And as long as they 're writing checks , write me one because someone put me in a oken plane . I 'd love a check .
CHARLIE: EASY WHIP-
HUGH: This tox report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine , felonies punishable by 24 years in jail . And if your intoxication is proven to have caused the death of the 4 passengers you 'll get 4 counts of manslaughter . That could e life in prison .
CHARLIE: He 'll get it done , Whip . It 's what his entire life is about . Trust me , trust him . Do n't worry Whip , you 're gon na walk away the hero you deserve to be .
WHIP: I 'm not worried , Charlie . I promise you that . No one could have landed that plane like I did , no one .
PIERS MORGAN: Captain Tilmon , we wan na play a portion of the black box that all of the news outlets have grabbed hold of
WHIP: When I ask for power , push both of these forward . Got it ? What 's you son 's name ?
BARTENDER: What 'll you have ?
WHIP: Can I get an orange juice ?
BARTENDER: That 's it ?
WHIP: And a double shot of Stoli .
PIERS MORGAN: Wow . That audio paints a strong picture . Captain Whitaker is surely a hero in my opinion .
JIM TILMON: Absolutely . However , every incident is different . The actions of the pilots on SouthJet 227 will e heavily scrutinized . It 's protocol for any investigation .
PASSENGER 1: We were in a nose dive and people were screaming and yelling and then the plane turned upside down and we had to hold on to our seat belts to keep from falling out of our chairs I saw one kid fall to the floo and this flight attendant picked him up and handed him to his dadI did n't see her again .
PASSENGER 2: We turned like a corkscrew and all I could think was , `` this is really happening , I 'm going to die '' and then all of a sudden the plane was upside down but steady and the pilot must have known how to fly it that way . He flipped it back ove and landed it hard .
NEIGHBOR: I thought it was thunder at first . But it shook the ground hard . Thunder do n't do like that . I ran outside and I could hear people yelling and I could see a small fire at first . I just took the dogs and headed down there . Then I saw the plane crumpled on the ground . I never seen nothing like that in my life .
WHIP: Taylor street , Taylor stah , here we are .
FRAN: ( gives Whip a puzzled
LOOK: Hey , do n't I know you ? Whip jabs him again with his cane .
WHIP: Keep your fucking hands off her !
SHE NODS: Is this all the stuff you want from here ?
NICOLE: Just this stuff .
WHIP: Okay , start taking that stuff down .
FRAN: She owes me 1100 bucks ! Plus damages !
WHIP: You wan na spend a thousand bucks suing her and get jack shit ? Or do you want to make a cash deal with me ?
FRAN: Give me 700 in cash .
WHIP: You 're a creepwith your baseball at bullshit
NICOLE: Ahmy car does n't run . It wo n't start . I 'm taking this with me .
WHIP: Your car does n't run ? What were you gon na do ?
NICOLE: I don'tII was I do n't know what I was gon na do .
WHIP: Then put the fucking box in my car .
NICOLE: What 's your name ?
WHIP: Whip . NICOLE nods . A long moment quietly passes .
NICOLE: Thank you , Captain Whip .
WHIP: You okay ?
NICOLE: I was gon na lay down , get some est .
WHIP: Okay .
NICOLE: Is it really okay that I stay here ?
WHIP: Yea . I want you to stay .
NICOLE: It 's throbbing because the blood is having a hard time getting back to your heart .
HUGH: Do you wan na shoot me or can I come inside ?
WHIP: C'mon in . I 'll shoot you inside .
HUGH: Your voice mail is full and you never answer your cell phone . I called your cell 10 times .
WHIP: I turned it off . HUGH nods as the explanation lands .
HUGH: I thought we 'd take a ride . WHIP measures HUGH 's intention
WHIP: Okay , gim me a minute . Wait here .
HUGH: You can see the initial impact sheared the right wing clean off . If only the left wing had come off at impact , I think everyone would have walked off that plane .
WHIP: The left wing partially pulled away-
HUGH: It snapped but stayed connected to the airframe . So it whipped back towards the plane , hit the fuselage in front of the tail . If you were sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on the left side , it was like being hit by a train .
WHIP: I drank a lot the night before that flight . I drank that morning too and I used coke to straighten up .
HUGH: I know , it 's in the toxicology eport .
WHIP: But that 's not the reason this happened .
HUGH: I know .
MINISTER: `` He will wipe away every tear from their eyes , and death shall be no more , neither shall there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain anymore , for the former things have passed away . '' Revelation 21 4
HUGH: They helped pull survivors out of the wreckage . Now they come out here every day and have a mass 30 minutes prior to the crash . And then they sit in silent prayer fo 10 minutes at 9 42which is when you went down .
WHIP: Why 'd you bring me here ?
HUGH: I needed you to see this .
WHIP: You trying to scare me ?
HUGH: I need to know that you can handle all this .
WHIP: Who 's God would do this ? It 's quiet before HUGH makes his case .
HUGH: So here 's the deal . Avington Carr , the owner of the airline , is on ou sideand he 's got big friends in Washington . He wants to sit down with us . 10 O'clock tomorrow morning .
WHIP: I 'll stop . I can stop . I told you I can stop . I wo n't drink .
HUGH: 10 O'clock tomorrow morning with Mr. Carr , the owner of the airline .
MR. CARR: I never wanted that fuckin ' airline . Neither did my brother .
HUGH LANG: I like baseball .
LEN CALDWELL: Everyone in Georgia likes baseball .
MR. CARR: Yeahso what 's the deal Lenny ? Is your union gon na survive this one ? More importantly ? How big a check you think I 'm gon na have to write ?
LEN CALDWELL: There were 6 fatalities on the
HUGH LANG: The 2 crew members do n't get settlements like the passengers . That 's a workman 's comp claim , part of the union contract they do a dangerous job and they know it .
MR. CARR: You 're the lawyer for the pilots ' union ?
LEN CALDWELL: No , this is Hugh Lang , the attorney we brought in to handle the criminal side of Captain Whitaker 's situation .
MR. CARR: Yes , and what is Mr. Whitaker 's situation ? NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight . We had to give them access to everything .
CHARLIE: I flew with him . He 's a great pilot .
MR. CARR: Is he a drunk ?
CHARLIE: He 's a heavy drinker . Should I ing him in ?
MR. CARR: In a minute . Alright , so let 's get down to it , Lenny . What does the union plan to do about this blood test that says Whitaker was high on ooze and coke ? This guy 's a real peach .
HUGH: I 'm gon na kill the toxicology eport . It was done incompetently . The last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in June of 2009 , which is 18 months past code . Their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when , is very incomplete . And they are n't sure who stored them . They used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and egister higher in an alcohol test . That 's what I 've done so far . I can handle this .
MR. CARR: I like this guy Lenny . He makes me wan na go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet .
LEN CALDWELL: Mr. Carr , we 're gon na fight to push all the fault on Jackson Ridgefield , the manufacturer .
MR. CARR: Oh and you think they 're gon na just open their check book and buy us all lunch ? Good fucking luck . What 's my exposure Jim ?
LEN CALDWELL: Speaking for the pilots ' union ? We do n't want your airline to go away . We enjoy your contract with us and we will protect Captain Whitake and in turn protect your airline .
MR. CARR: That 's sweet Mr. Caldwell , but if the NTSB leaks that toxicology eport showing my pilot was flying that plane drunk ? We 're all fucked .
CHARLIE: So far we 've been lucky .
MR. CARR: Lucky ? ! Are you that goddammed dumb ? ! You think they 're waiting for a light news day to splash the headline , `` Drunk , coke-addled pilot crashes a plane ? ! ''
HUGH LANG: Trust me , I 'm gon na kill the toxicology report . That 's my job . CARR looks to his lawyer who nods
CARR'S ATTORNEY: I wish you luck , but we 're still sorting out the best way to go forward legally . We might split from you and go it alone .
HUGH LANG: To go it alone ? Without us ? That would be what the French call `` a ig fucking mistake . ''
MR. CARR: Does Whitaker know he 's going to jail ?
HUGH LANG: I have n't had a client go to jail yet .
MR. CARR: He 's going to jail . He belongs in jail . You bet your ass he 's going to jail , the question isis he gon na die in jail ?
HUGH LANG: You 're wrong , Mr. Carr .
CARR'S ATTORNEY: Last time I checked , 6 counts of manslaughter is life in prison .
MR. CARR: Life in prison , what we in Georgia call `` all day long . ''
WHIP'S VOICE: Get up ! What ? You ca n't get up ? ! C'mon , Knuckles Whitaker drags himself up and goes longgo .
NICOLE: Hey . Sorry I 'm a little late , but we went for coffee after the meeting Whip ?
WHIP: Do n't , do n't , do n't ! I 'll get him . Knuckles , junior . See him . Yeah . I 'm not calling again . Fuck him . He did n't call . Not back . Not calling back .
NICOLE: Are you okay ? You were in bad shape when I got home .
WHIP: Tired . Guess I drank a bit .
NICOLE: A bit ?
WHIP: You wan na count the fuckin ' beers ? They 're still in the garbage . Vodka too , is that okay with you ?
NICOLE: It 's more than okay , Whip .
WHIP: Good .
NICOLE: I 've been watching the sky change as the sun rises . Beautiful . Perfect light , I went out and took some great shots .
WHIP: Lem me see that camera .
NICOLE: My mom got it for me . Towards the end , when she knew she was n't gon na ecover . She maxed out her credit card to buy me that camera and a lighting kit .
WHIP: It was my grandfather 's farm , my dad grew up here . He was a pilot in World War II , flew with the 332nd . See the landing strip out there ? He built that . He ran a crop duster outta here until the EPA put an end to that . He traded the crop duster for a used Cessna . He flew that damn thing all over . It 's still in the arn . I was gon na sell this place after my dad died . Then I got divorced
NICOLE: And your mom ?
WHIP: Deadshe 's dead . Your dad still alive ?
NICOLE: I 'm pretty sure my father lives in Colorado .
WHIP: You got no relationship with him .
NICOLE: He drank . It was my mom that aised me . She was incredible .
BOY: I 'm Trevor . You saved my mom .
MARGARET: It 's great to see you , Whip .
WHIP: You too Margaret . Broken colla one ?
MARGARET: Yeah , and some stitches but I 'm fine . I really am . It was a nice service . I mean , look at all these people that wanted to say goodbye . She looked eautiful in there . Did n't you think so , Whip ? Like she was gon na wake up and smile .
WHIP: I did n't go in . I could n't . MARGARET is sensing WHIP 's struggle .
MARGARET: Trevor , find Dad . He 's by Mr. Benton , there .
TREVOR LEAVES: Are you okay ? You should come to the counseling group . The union has great people for us to talk to .
WHIP: No . I ca n't , really . I will , but just not now .
MARGARET: Take care Whip , okay ? She starts to leaveWHIP stops her with
WHIP: Yeahy'knowI 'm in the middle of this investigation . The NTSB is investigating the crash-
MARGARET: I know . I 'm going in to see them next week .
WHIP: I 'm nervous because I was out the night before the crash at dinner-
MARGARET: With Trina
WHIP: Yeah and I had two glasses of wine . And they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought I had anything to drink . MARGARET appears speechless
MARGARET: I 've known you 11 years and you 're gon na stand here and tell me you and Trina went to dinner and you drank two glasses of wine ? Sounds like a nice restaurant Whip , which one was it ?
WHIP: You have to tell them it was an ordinary day . I mean it was an ordinary day . You know I was in shape to fly . You have a problem with saying that ?
MARGARET: It 's a lie . Whip , it 's a lie . Trina told me you two had n't been to sleep .
WHIP: My lack of sleep made the plane fall apart , huh Margaret ? I 'm just trying to get it straight . You think that another pilot would have een able to land that plane and save more lives ?
MARGARET: I did n't say that Whip . I ca n't imagine another pilot doing-
WHIP: Well can you imagine Trevor at this same church looking at you in that ox in there ? Or my son having to come and see me in prison ?
MARGARET: Please Whip , enough . Do n't you think we 've all had enough . What do you want me to say ?
WHIP: It was an ordinary day . The storm ight after we took off was very severe , but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day .
NICOLE: Are you okay ? How was it ?
WHIP: It was okay , okay . How 're you doin ' ? A beat .
NICOLE: Well , I got through my first day . They have n't fired me .
WHIP: That 's good . Cause for a celebration .
NICOLE: They needed someone to work the night shift . They asked me and it 's time and a half so
WINGS: You 're dad flew a P-51 , right ?
WHIP: He did . So should we get some dinner ?
NICOLE: I promised Sheila I would be at the meeting tonight . She 's the one that 's been helping me , my sponsor . Can we do it tomorrow night ? And Please , Whip do n't make me choose etween dinner with you and the meeting . WHIP nods , playing with the lighter .
WHIP: No , it 's okay . You should go .
NICOLE: Why do n't you come with me ? We 'll eat after . It 's an open meeting .
WHIP: Open meeting ?
NICOLE: That means anybody can come . Anybody .
WHIP: Even me ?
THE ASSEMBLY: Hi Barry .
WHIP: I got ta go . Okay ?
NICOLE NODS: Can uh
NICOLE: Yeah , Sheila . She can take me back to work .
SHEILA: I 'm Sheila .
KEN EVANS: And in truth , I do n't have much to say about him .
PIERS MORGAN: So , safe to say that he remains a mystery .
KEN EVANS: Sir , those are your words not mine .
PIERS MORGAN: I 've been speaking to some people who are very close to the NTSB investigation and they are very confident that they will be able to determine exactly what brought this plane down .
KEN EVANS: I 'm sure they will sir .
PIERS MORGAN: Thank you , Ken and Vicki Evans .
KEN EVANS: Thank you , and God bless .
WHIP: How 're you feeling , Ken ? EVANS stares at WHIP with a blank look .
EVANS: Happy to be alive .
VICKI EVANS: Blessed to be alive .
WHIP: I 'm Captain Whitaker , I was flying-
VICKI EVANS: I know who you are .
EVANS: Ma'am can you give us some privacy ? Thank you .
TO WHIP: Come on in sir . Shut the door .
WHIP: Listen , how long have you been
EVANS: Outta the coma ? Two days .
WHIP: I did n't mean to disrupt your whole day . I know they been swamping you with interviews . You were great on
EVANS: Both my legs were crushed and my pelvis snapped . I 'll probably never walk again , least not without a walker or braces . I 'll certainly never fly again .
WHIP: I 'm sorry Ken .
EVANS: That plane was doomed the second you sat in the chair . You reeked like gin or somethin ' . I called Vicki from the plane before we took off . That 's when the rain kicked up .
WHIP: I do n't know how much you remember , ut the plane started to fall apart .
EVANS: I remember everything until we crashed . I know what went on .
WHIP: What are we talking about ?
EVANS: I do n't know Captain Whitaker , what are we talking about ?
WHIP: I just wanted to get a sense from you what you thought caused the crash .
EVANS: Was it the fact that you got on the plane drunk from the night before ? WHIP goes white and drops his head .
WHIP: You think you 'd be alive without me on that plane ?
EVANS: No , we 'd all be dead . But are you gon na argue that your physical state was tip top ?
WHIP: I 'm not gon na argue anything with you .
EVANS: Sit , please sit .
WHIP SITS: I never shared my opinion about your physical state the morning of the flight . I 've never said word . WHIP sits and studies EVANS .
VICKI EVANS: Praise Jesus .
EVANS: And he has a higher plan for you sir . This event although tragic in its loss of life is also a celebration of life .
VICKI EVANS: Praise Jesus .
EVANS: Captain , will you pray with me ?
VICKI EVANS: Praise Jesus . It is quiet for an extended beat . Finally
WHIP: Praise Jesus .

CHARLIE: Here 's our guy . C'mon .
HUGH: Captain Whitaker , we 've won .
CHARLIE: They 've scheduled the hearing . It 's in 10 days .
HUGH: But these hearings can be tough . You just need to stay sharp and on course and answer the questions correctly . It 's no longer a question of your condition but the condition of the plane .
WHIP: Look , it 's simple . I flew a broken plane .
CHARLIE: You got it . That 's right .
WHIP: And what about my toxicology eport ?
HUGH: I killed it . They have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane . And no eye witness claims . But there 's a problem . This stops WHIP cold .
WHIP: Okay . I seewhere this is going . That 's funny that they found two ottles .
HUGH: Why ?
WHIP: Because I drank three . One 's missing . HUGH explodes in frustration .
HUGH LANG: When I met you I could n't believe what a flip , drunk , arrogant scumbag you were .

WHIP: What fucking life ? ! Do n't kill yourself on my account , Hugh . WHIP starts to walk away .
HUGH: Okay , I 'm done here . I 'm running out a faith that this guy 's gon na make it , Charlie .
WHIP: You wan na talk about me like I 'm not here ? Like I 'm fucking dead ?
HUGH: This NTSB hearing is a Federal Agency Hearing . Do you understand that ? It 's in 10 days and if I show up with you like this ? !

It 's all in there ; photos , testimony , interviewsI called Ellen Block let her know that you 're here and all tucked in .
WHIP: So does she have the knife out fo me ?
HUGH LANG: Remember she 's limited in what she can ask you . You 're not on trial ut you are under oath . She 's probably not happy that I killed the tox report , but you 'll be fine . WHIP laughs a little .

WHIP: Do not tell me how to lie about my drinking . I 've been lying about my drinking my whole life .
ELLEN BLOCK: Those are difficult images to watch . For the record , I 'm Ellen Block , Hearing Officer for this hearing . Captain Whitaker , good morning .
WHIP: Morning .
ELLEN BLOCK: What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a elatively stable glide just prio to the moment of impact . However , according to the data we etrieved from the cockpit data ecorders , at exactly 9 34 , afte flying 27 minutes without incident , the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet pe minute in what is considered a `` full pitch nose down '' attitude . Then at 9 42 , according to the data ecorders , a decision was made to invert the aircraft . The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point . ELLEN points to the screen
WHIP: I 'm not sure it was conscious . It was more of an instinct .
ELLEN BLOCK: What led to that decision ?
WHIP: I do n't recall .
ELLEN BLOCK: Let me quote from an investigative summary '' From 9 34 until 9 42 the events on the aircraft are '' again I quote , `` bold and remarkable '' `` By inverting the plane , Captain Whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field .
WHIP: I heard a metallic bang . We pitched nose down . No control .
ELLEN BLOCK: You had no idea what was wrong with the aircraft ?
WHIP: There was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft .
ELLEN BLOCK: As I said before you can add any details you like to any comments I make . Do you remember any thing else that was out of the ordinary ? Did you feel the flight crew was in their best shape ?
WHIP: Yes .
ELLEN BLOCK: It was raining very hard the morning you took off , was n't it ?
WHIP: There was some convective activity in the area . However , my first officer and I discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums .
ELLEN BLOCK: Yes , first officer Evans ' testimony confirms the same .
WHIP: I appreciate that .
ELLEN BLOCK: Mr. Whitaker , I want to talk about the days leading and hours leading up to the accident . But before I do , I want to remind you that you are under oath and any testimony that you give here today will be considered admissable in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings , do you understand what that means ? WHIP nods .
WHIP: Yes , I understand .
ELLEN BLOCK: On the three days leading up to the day of the accident Tuesday , October 11th , Wednesday , Octobe 12th or Thursday , October 13th of 2011 did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements ? WHIP takes his time .
WHIP: No . I did not .
ELLEN BLOCK: On the morning of the accident , Friday , October 14th , did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job ?
WHIP: No . I did not . ELLEN wraps up this line of questions
ELLEN BLOCK: Mr. Whitaker , do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency , alcoholism or drug addiction ?
WHIP: No .
ELLEN BLOCK: Okay , Mr. Whitaker , we 're about done . Due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight , you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane . Is that correct ?
WHIP: Yes . I suspended the drink service .
ELLEN BLOCK: Are you aware that ou investigators found two single- service Vodka bottles in the galley trash bin ?
WHIP: Yes .
ELLEN BLOCK: There were 5 crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley . Less than an hour after the accident , blood was taken from each of the crew members . Yourself
WHIP: I am now .
ELLEN BLOCK: Miss Marquez was not only a colleague , but you knew her outside of work ? Correct ?
WHIP: Outside of work ? Not really .
ELLEN BLOCK: Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem ?
WHIP: No . I did not .
ELLEN BLOCK: Did you ever see her drink to excess ?
WHIP: No . I did not .
ELLEN BLOCK: Did you know that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction ? The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines ?
WHIP: No . I did not .
ELLEN BLOCK: Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank the vodka on the plane ?
WHIP: Can you repeat the question ?
ELLEN BLOCK: Your opinion Captain . Is it you opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight ?
WHIP: I 'm sorry . My what
ELLEN BLOCK: Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing , and she in fact tested positive fo alcohol , is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those 2 ottles of vodka on the flight ?
WHIP: I SAIDGod help me
ELLEN BLOCK: Yes , well . However , is it you opinion Whip cuts her off
EXCESSIVELY LOUD: IT 'S MY OPINION It 's my opinion Trina DID NOTdrink the vodka .
ELLEN BLOCK: Excuse me , Mr. Whitaker
WHIP: She saved that boy 's life
ELLEN BLOCK: Captain Whitaker can you speak
CHARLIE: OBJECTION ! ! !
WHIP: I drank the vodka bottles on the plane .
ELLEN BLOCK: Mr. Whitaker , in light of that emark , would you like to eaddress
WHIP: You do n't have to readdress anything . I DRANK THE VODKA !
ELLEN BLOCK: On the three nights before the accident , October 11th-
WHIP: On October 11th , 12th and 13th and 14th I was intoxicated . I drank alcohol on all of those days . I drank to excess .
ELLEN BLOCK: Mr. Whitaker , on the morning of
WHIP: I was drunk . I 'm drunk right now , Miss BlockI 'm drunk right I 'm drunk now , because Because I 'm an alcoholic .
COLLECTS HIMSELF: But at least I 'm sober , and I 'm grateful for that . Whip gives it to us straight

FRED: Whoa , whoa , big fella
PILTDOWN: You 've been asking for this , Flintstone I 'm gon na kick you fat butt
FRED: Fat butt ? Hold me back , Barney Barney , hold me back
BARNEY: Hey , maybe you guys oughta fix that first .
PILTDOWN: Why should we ?
BARNEY: It looks dangerous . Besides , you can kick Fred 's fat butt anytime .
FRED: Yeah . That 's right . I mean this ai n't over , Piltdown . Come on , guys . Let 's clean up the mess .
SLATE: Bankrupt ? Are you crazy ?
LAVA: It 's all here in hack and slice . When you committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few clams per ton . Since then , it 's gone up a hundredfold . You ca n't build a project like this without the heavy equipment dinos , and we ca n't afford to feed those dinos . Slate glowers , paces around the model .
SLATE: I 'm two months behind schedule , my option 's running out on the land and Donald Trumprock is just waiting to jump in and steal the whole deal meanwhile that damn union 's on my back , hell , they 'll probably want an eighty hour week or something There 's got to be an answer
SLATE: What 's that ?
LAVA: Sounds like a worker 's comp claim if I ever heard one
FRED: Barney ! Grab that line ! Hurry !
LAVA: Uncle , Uncle , speak to me
SLATE: I 'm over here , you moron and do n't call me 'Uncle ' !
BARNEY: Hey , nice going , Fred . You even got the spare
FRED: Barney , shut up Mr . Slate Mr . Slate are you all right ?
SLATE: For five years Slate Construction has had the finest safety record in Bedrock . Our workers are trained in first aid , our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free . And then something like this happens I want to know how ! A cacophony of voices starts to answer .
PILTDOWN: It was Flintstone , Mr . Slate !
PYRITE: That 's right , Mr . Slate , it was Flintstone !
BARNEY: That 's a lie , Mr . Slate !
SLATE: Who are you ?
BARNEY: B. Rubble . White male personal eference
SLATE: Flintstone , I have just one thing to say to you
FRED: Oh , it 's ah , just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop with a little help from my uddy Barney , right , Barn ?
BARNEY: Well , actually , Fred , it was the other way ar
BARNEY: Sure , Fred , right , right .
SLATE: The rest of you men go back to work . I want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone . Come on , move , move They go out , Piltdown looking furious .
LAVA: Eighths
SLATE: Eighths , right . Flintstone , what do you call this stuff ?
FRED: Well , Mr . Slate , I call it Barney , what do I call it ?
BARNEY: Fibrerock , Fred
FRED: I call it Fibrerock Fred ! I mean , ah , 'Fibrerock ' !
SLATE: 'Fibrerock ' ? 'Fibrerock ' ? 'Fib-bre-rock ' Slate 's staff make disparaging noises .
SLATE: I love it !
SLATE'S STAFF: Love it great has a nice ing says it all , you know ?
SLATE: You see this , Lava ? All those courses of yours at Harvrock University , and who saves my bacon ? Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies .
BARNEY: Gee , thanks , Mr . Slate .
SLATE: Boys , this is a small step fo Slate Construction a giant step for all mankind .
BETTY: Here we are , Mrs . Slate . Sorry you had to ride in the back .
MRS. SLATE: Not at all . I 'm used to being driven around .
CHILDREN: 'La hachette de ma tante est sur le roche de mon oncle '
HEADMISTRESS: Madame Mrs . Slate , bonjour ! Welcome to L'ecole des Enfants Prehistorique Haute Superior !
MRS. SLATE: Thank you , Marie . I ordered the hors d'oeuvres fo the junior talent show . They were out of Ceolanth caviar so I got Mastodon brie instead . Oh , ah , these are my , uh , friends , Wilma Flintstein
WILMA: Flintstone
MRS. SLATE: oh , it used to be Flintstein ? And this is ah , Becky Betty !
HEADMISTRESS: Enchante .
WILMA: I 'm sure .
BETTY: Likewise .
HEADMISTRESS: Well , Madame Slate , as you can see , we remain ze creme de la creme in the croissant of life known as Bedrock . Now , your leetle gran ' nephew will be wiz us for two weeks , no ? Here is ze application for him . An ' mais oui , he weel participate in zee annual talent show , naturalment ?
MRS. SLATE: Them ? Oh , Marie , really , you do n't understand
BETTY: That 's right , you do n't understand . My husband 's business manager usually handles this sort of thing , but I do n't mind .
WILMA: Let me have one of those , too . Fo ma petite Pebbles .
HEADMISTRESS: Of course . Any friend of Madame Slate is a friend of mine . As Mrs . Slate reacts , we
BARNEY: Gee , Fred , I do n't believe it . Eight hours ago I did n't have a job and now look I got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock !
FRED: Just be thankful I was there to go over the fine print . It 's like I told you this morning There 's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day 's work . Once you file those dreams under 'old usiness ' and put your nose to the plow , well , the world is you oyster . And was I right ?
BARNEY: No , Fred , you were n't . I did n't nose any grindstones and you did n't shoulder a wheel . We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident .
FRED: Details , Barney , details I just ca n't wait to see the girls ' faces when we tell 'em the news
WILMA: It 's not like the boys to be so late .
BETTY: Unless they were forced to go owling again . Remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said , 'go bowling right now ' ?
WILMA: Betty , sometimes you 're a little too gullible
BETTY: Do n't tell me . I still ca n't elieve what I did today
WILMA: No kidding . Do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is ? And get this it 's non-refundable
BETTY: I know , I know ! I just could n't stand that woman 's attitude ! But we had to find a new school anyway , and there we were the next thing I knew , I was in over my head ut why did you jump in , too ?
WILMA: Oh , she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about he little nephew and
BETTY: And ?
WILMA: And if a friend ca n't help you do something stupid , who can ?
BETTY: What do we tell the boys ?
WILMA: What 's wrong with the truth ?
BETTY: We put ourselves in debt so the kids can attend school with a family we ca n't stand ?
WILMA: Maybe we could rephrase it
BETTY: Flowers ?
WILMA: Rock candy ? That 's nice , but why ?
FRED: Why ? Oh , me and Barn , we suddenly ealized that we had a little spare change .
WILMA: Not anymore you do n't
BARNEY: Betty , these are for you . Fo sticking beside me during the tough times , and well fo making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall .
BETTY: Aw , Barney I I do n't deserve these . I did something really stupid today .
BARNEY: Hey . Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him .
FRED: Noogy , noogy , ha , ha !
WILMA: Have you been drinking ?
FRED: Ready when you are . Hey , ' 1 ' a good year . This confuses the girls even more .
WILMA: Fred , there 's no easy way to say this so
BETTY: Boys did you see the dolla signs there at the bottom ?
WILMA: The non-refundable dollar signs ?
BARNEY: Plenty more where that came from .
FRED: We see your dollar signs , ladies and
WILMA: Betty these these look eal
FRED: You bet they 're real , sweetheart . They 're as real as as well , as real as the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world . Barney squeezes back .
BARNEY: Yeah . And nothing 's ever gon na change that right , Fred ?
FRED: Right , pal o'mine .
HERDMASTER: Brothers , your attention !
HERDMASTER: The herd is now called to the prairie . Antlers up !
ENTIRE GROUP: Ack-ack-a-dack !
HERDMASTER: This meeting of the Wate Buffaloes is now in session . Sergeant-at-Arms , have we got any old business ?
BARNEY: Indeed we do , Brother Herdmaster . Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates fo Lodge offices , such as good old Fred and some other guys .
HERDMASTER: Brother Piltdown You have given the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at the Poisoned Water Hole . Do you wish to file an objection ?
PILTDOWN: You bet I do . How come Flintstone is 'good old Fred ' and me and the other candidates are just 'some other guys ' ?
PYRITE: Yeah , how come ?
BARNEY: My apologies , Brother Piltdown . Allow me to rephrase . Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole unch of good old guys plus the one and only Fred Flintstone !
FRED: Brother Buffaloes , honored Herdmaster , Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers , a great good evening to you all . Ahem . As you know , our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths . But we here have come through the croo the crux
BARNEY: crucible
FRED: crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed . Now , the future holds many promises and many problems . As your next Herdmaster , I would bring to you the same determination , courage and if I may say so bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace . Thank you , and ack ack a-dack . Applause follows Fred 's return to the floor .
LODGE MEMBER: Congratulations , Fred .
FRED: Hey , when you 're hot you 're hot oys , lem me buy a round of drinks for everyone .
BARNEY: Thanks , Fred , but here at the lodge drinks are free .
FRED: But the principle is the same , Barn . Do n't forget that .
BARNEY: 'Here 's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster Fred ' !
FRED: Aw , gee , Barn you should n't say that at least not till after next week 's election !
LODGE MEMBER: Fred , what was all that stuff in your speech about the workplace ? I thought the only decision you made there was how many lunches to eat
FRED: Well , Harry , it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world Boys , you 're looking at Mr . Slate 's new partner .
PILTDOWN: You and Slate ? Who are you kidding , Flintstone ? The only partner you got is hanging ove your belt . Pyrite laughs , a bit too much .
FRED: Prepare to eat those words , Piltdown .
PILTDOWN: If I do n't , you will
FRED: Gentlemen , my card
LODGE MEMBERS: Hey , way ta go , Fred Whoa , gon na switch from a hard hat to a top hat , Freddy boy ?
PYRITE: Ah , it 's probably a phony
BARNEY: Gee , Fred , how come I did n't get any business cards ?
FRED: Barney , it 's all part of the plan . Yes , boys , you see , I went up to my pal , Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he could n't refuse
BARNEY: Fred , we got ta talk turkey
FRED: That 's right just like that
BARNEY: Fred !
FRED: Ah , excuse us , boys
BARNEY: Fred what 's this single-handed stuff ? I distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine .
FRED: Barney , we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff , how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all , but what would that be ?
BARNEY: The truth ?
FRED: This is big business , Barney . We ca n't start telling the truth , it 'd create the wrong impression . Think about all the really big deals in history back to the eginning of recorded time .
BARNEY: Okay .
FRED: What do they all have in common ? I 'll tell you . A front man . A guy who 's out in the public eye unning the point , fighting the crowds and meanwhile back in the corner is the silent partner .
BARNEY: I never knew that .
FRED: That 's because the silent partne is always silent .
BARNEY: I get it . I got the brains , but you just pretend to have them .
FRED: Attaboy !
BETTY: Barney , wait a minute
BARNEY: Thanks , Betty . What would I do without you ?
BETTY: Hmm . Probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries .
BARNEY: Come on , Betty , it 's only my first day . You have to have seniority to run off She giggles , kisses him .
WILMA: Fred ! Wait a minute ! There 's something wrong with your lunch
FRED: Yeah it does feel a little light
WILMA: Fit for a king my king .
FRED: Aw , Wilma lookit , it 's got uckles , a strap , a lock
WILMA: Good luck . Watch out for those you know hostile takeovers .
FRED: I 'm already taken . He moves to the car .
BARNEY: Yes , yes . Looking good , Miste Flintstone . I see you 've ecovered from that polo accident .
FRED: Yas , yas . The water was too deep and my horse drowned . They crack up at their own wit , drive off .
LAVA: Ivan , look , okay , so I bought too much on margin everyone said glaciers were here to stay , I mean , who knew ? Just leverage my shares in Atlantis dry goods and what ? When did that happen ? Piltdown enters , knocks on the open door .
PILTDOWN: Mister Lava , the armored car is here .
LAVA: Armored car ?
PILTDOWN: Yeah . Must be a fortune in coo-coo berries on that baby . You know , for that Fibrerock stuff of Flintstone and Rubble 's . You got ta sign here for it .
LAVA: I I 'll get back to you .
PILTDOWN: Gee , Mister Lava , I donno . I kinda like girls myself .
LAVA: What I mean , is , I 'm going to use you to double-cross your Lodge and Union brothers , and make thei lives a living hell .
PILTDOWN: Oh , okay .
LAVA: Good . You and your little pal will report directly to me and take orders only from me . Now get out of here and start screwing your former friends and associates .
BARNEY: Gee , Fred , driving with you is etter than an ' E ' ticket at Magerock Mountain .
FRED: Gets the old adrenaline going , Barn . Us big executives , we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning .
LAVA: Flintstone ! Rubble !
BARNEY: Oh , hi , Mister Lava .
LAVA: Please , call me Jerry . Uncle I mean , Mister Slate told me to take you to your offices . If you 'll follow me ?
FRED: Hey . What 's going on ?
LAVA: The Fibrerock assembly line . Unc Mister Slate 's had a crew working on it all weekend . We 're going to roll out the first sheets of Fibrerock by mid-week .
FRED: Yes , yes . Quick , dynamic entry into the marketplace . I approve .
BARNEY: But , Fred , it 's right where the employee basketball court used ta be
FRED: Hey , you 're right Big business is hell , Barney . Trust me you 'll get used to it .
BARNEY: I guess so . You already did . Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer .
LAVA: Well , gentlemen , here you are . As soon as you 're settled , come ove to the assembly line . We 'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run . He goes off . Fred and Barney go
BARNEY: All-right !
FRED: Welcome to the top partner . And as they shake , we
BARNEY: Ready aim fibre !
SLATE: Men , this is a proud day for Slate Construction . You have seen the first pieces of Fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history a history you are all part of thanks to your very own fellow worker , Fred Flintstone !

SLATE: Why , I could even fire Lava here if I wanted .
FRED: Me ! Ah , ha , that 's rich , Mr . Slate , that 's Suddenly Fred stops laughing .
SLATE: Flintstone , Lava , here , ecommended that you be in charge of public relations to get Fibrerock off to a good start . I 'm a member of that public , Flintstone , and I have to say this is n't a good start . I 'm getting a bad feeling about Fibrerock . A bad feeling about you . You want that feeling to go away , do n't you ?
FRED: Uh well , gee , I uh , yeah .
SLATE: Good . Then turn around and walk out of here and we 'll forget all about this .
WORKERS: Well ? What 'd he say ? Ol ' Freddie boy told him a thing o two Probably got us a raise Right , Fred ? Fred ?

EXITING BUFFALO: 'Night , Barney . So long , fatso .
BUFFALO #2: See ya , Barn . Flintstone , you 're dead meat .
WILMA: Fred , is there something you want to tell me about the lodge meeting ?
FRED: I do n't wan na talk about it . Besides , who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads ? I 'm more of a country club guy myself anyway
LAVA: A simple little heist I gave you everything but the keys and you blew it
PILTDOWN: Hey , we got the union guys to eak in and create a distraction , did n't we ? Who knew Flintstone and Rubble would show up , too ?
LAVA: The day after Slate City opens there 's going to be an audit . If the stuff is n't gone by then we 'll all be doing time until the Bronze Age .
PYRITE: Do n't worry , Mister Lava we 're on top of it .
BARNEY: Excuse me , Mister Lava ? I think you oughta know something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix .
LAVA: How do you know that ? I mean ah , why do you say that ?
BARNEY: It tastes different .
LAVA: Tastes different ?
BARNEY: Yup . See , ever since I started with Fibrerock I mean , since me and Fred started with it , I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam . And tonight 's batch , well I did n't get much of it , ut it seems a little off . Ca n't fool the old taste buds , heh-heh . I think there might be an ingredient missing . So tomorrow , I 'll run a couple of tests and stuff
LAVA: Rubble , Rubble ! We 're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City and we 're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy you tastebuds ! If you ask me , you and your tastebuds are overworked overwrought how long have you been with us , anyway ?
BARNEY: Nine days , Mister Lava .
LAVA: Jumping Jurrasic , no wonder you 're so run down .
BARNEY: But
LAVA: No , do n't try and thank me .
SLATE: 'Sky 's the limit ' 'sky 's the limit ' why , these two buildings , they they practically scrape the sky ! We should call them Slate scrapers !
LAVA: That 's brilliant , Unc Miste Slate . In fact , maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex I wan na call 'em the FibreSphere and the '____ ' something Needle but I just ca n't
SLATE: How about , 'Slate Needle ' ?
LAVA: 'Slate Need ' How do you keep coming up with these ? It 's uncanny .
SLATE: It 's a gift
LAVA: Oh , that reminds me , sign these , will you just a few overruns minor cost problems that 's it thank you
LAVA: Oh , Mister Slate , we 're going to hold the Bedrock Junior Talent Show in the uh , 'Slate Needle . ' Good for public relations
PILTDOWN: Can we help you sir ?
BARNEY: Ah , yup , yup , young feller jest show me the way to the personnel office I 'm lookin ' fer a jo as a custodian
PYRITE: Our pleasure .
PILTDOWN: Ya can start by cleaning the street with your pants !
LAVA: That takes care of the half-pint . Now to deal with the half-wit .
FRED: But Barney does n't want to take a vacation he says he 's got ta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam
LAVA: Oh ? Or check up on us ?
LAVA: Flintstone , that that 's a slap in the face of our founder ou employer our uncle . Unless , of course , you agree with Rubble that Mister Slate is n't capable of running this operation that I 'm not capable of unning it ?
FRED: Of course not , Mister Lava . But
LAVA: Call me Jerry . Sit down , please
FRED: Why , yeah , sure , Jerry .
LAVA: Fred , let me get to the bottom slime . Some men you and me , for instance we 're cut out fo the big time , the big bucks the big everything .
LIZARD: When they say smoking is bad fo your health , they 're not kidding
LAVA: And others ? Wellll
FRED: Well , actually , I would n't say small part I 'd say
LAVA: Yes ?
FRED: Kind of a medium-sized well , almost medium-sized well , really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type , of
LAVA: You 're too kind , Flintstone , that 's what I like about you . But you 're a big guy with a big decision to make . Are you gon na keep covering for Barney , keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties ?
FRED: Well , gee , that 's tough one Uh , what are my important duties ?
LAVA: Publicity , Flintstone , publicity !
FRED: R-rockin ' Leach ?
LEACH: 'Ello , Fred . I 've 'eard a lot h'about you from Mister Lava . H'at 's why we 're going to put you on our program .
FRED: M-me ? On on television ?
LAVA: Right , Fred . As long as you forget all this nonsense about Barney .
FRED: Barney who ?
LEACH: Hmm . Lovely little guest 'ouse , Mister Flintstone . So simple , so ordinary , so unexceptional why , h'it 's almost quaint . Let 's say we start with the camera 'ere , except
FRED: W-what 's wrong ?
LEACH: Well , just look at that yard ove there barbecues and trikes , not exactly the right image
FRED: Maybe you could move those plants to block them out ?
LEACH: Good idea . Rodney , get 'hoppin ' with those greens .
WILMA: Fred , this was supposed to be a 'typical evening ' at the Flintstones , and you invited fifty people I do n't even know . Now what 's going on ? Where are they taking my ficus-sauruses ?
FRED: It 's the Rubble yard , Wilma . It 's just not the right image
BETTY: I do n't know why you want to go to this thing after the way Fred 's been treating you lately
BARNEY: Fred 's in a high-powered executive job , Betty . There 's a lot of pressure on him .
BETTY: Yeah and it 's all around his elt . If it was n't for poor Wilma I would n't give him the Geological Time
BARNEY: Trust me , Betty . After the Fibrerock debut , he 'll be the same old Fred .
BIRD: I 've heard of a flash in the pan , ut this is ridiculous
LEACH: Good evening . Tonight we come to you live from the ah charming pied a terre of the man of the 'our , Fred Flintstone
WILMA: Thank heaven . There is n't one person I know here .
BARNEY: You mean beside Fred ?
WILMA: I mean including Fred . They look over at
LEACH: Frederick , of course , is the man ehind Fibrerock the invention that some predict will evolutionize life in the future . Frederick , 'ow does it feel to know that you 'ave personally ought the Stone Age as we know it to a long-deserved end ?
FRED: Well , Rockin ' , you 're right , I have affected destiny for all mankind , and it 's a sobering thought . However , if I may add a personal note at this time , I myself can not personally take all the credit for Fibrerock
BARNEY: See ? What 'd I tell ya ?
FRED: No , I could never have done it without the inspiration and support of a very special person . I 'm speaking , of course , of my close friend and associate , Mister Slate , founder and C.E.O . of Slate Construction
LAVA: Of course , Poindexter , of course .
FRED: Hello , hello . Bon soir . Good to see ya glad you could make it
GUEST: Hello , Frank
FRED: Fred there 's the bar , make yourself at home mi casa es votre casa , so , when in Rome and all that
WILMA: Fred , can I talk to you ? Fred ? Fred ? We have a serious problem with Betty and Barney .

CHIEF: Feldspar , if you ask me , you 've seen too many Rockzilla movies In all the Xenosaurus sightings we 've had reported , not one has had this kind of wholesale destruction
FELDSPAR: Chief , you you got ta believe me just one swipe of its paw and wham a whole house was pre-history !

FELDSPAR: Artillery .
BARNEY: Fred , stop it ! It might know the way inside !
SLATE: What the devil 's going on here ?
FRED: It 's real simple , Mister Slate . Your boy Lava here has been stealing the coo-coo berries from the Fibrerock mix and fixing the ooks to hide it !
LAVA: That 's ridiculous , Flintstone ! Nobody could get that many coo-coo erries off our premises !
BETTY: These sure look like coo-coo erries to me
LAVA: They 're convincing fakes , Mrs. Rubble part of our exciting display
PYRITE: Fakes ? Gee , Pilty , I thought the real ones were gon na be moved up here for us ta steal whatta waste a time
PILTDOWN: Pyrite , shaddup
FRED: Now I remember ! These guys were pulling this xenosaurus act that night at the plant ! What 's this , Lava 'Plan B ' ?
LAVA: Uncle ! Are you going to stand there while aspersions are being cast at the Slate family ? This is absurd
SLATE: Of course it is ! Why , without the coo-coo berry sap , Fibrerock would be completely unstable
LAVA: All right , all right , I admit it ! I got in over my head in the stock market took some big losses I had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster but it still was n't enough and when I saw all those coo-coo berries being delivered every day , I guess I just lost my head I figured with the Woca sap in the Fibremix , the berry juice as superfluous
SLATE: I 'll tell you what 's superfluous , Lava your liver ! So why do n't we remove it !
FIRE CHIEF: Come on , come on , what 's the hold up ?
FIREFIGHTER: It 's the kibble crisis , sir the firesauruses have been on half-rations for a month ! Above them , the BUILDING SHUDDERS again .

TED: I ca n't run this place by myself .
BETTY: Oh , sure ya can .

BETTY: Sam ran this place by himself fo fifty years .
TED: Yeah , and he had fifty years of fuckin ' practice , too . I have n't had a day .
BETTY: Look , Teddy , calm down
TED: Do n't call me Teddy .
BETTY: Ted , the night 's cake . It 's easy . The day 's when it 's busy . During the night there 's nothing to do .
TED: It 's New Year 's Eve .
BETTY: Which 'll make it less busy than normal . Ever worked on Christmas ? Unless you sell turkeys , business is dead . You just got butterflies , that 's all .
TED: What I have ai n't butterflies . I ca n't handle this hotel all by myself . Betty slows the scene down .

TED: Okay okay okay I 'm calm , I 'm cool , let 's talk .
BETTY: Ted , in a nutshell , all you have to do is hold the fort . It 's New Year 's Eve . Most of the guests are going out . You 'll just be giving them a little nod as they come staggering in at three four five in the morning . Nobody 's having any parties , a few get-togethers , but no parties . You got about three people checking in tonight , that 's it . The only variable is Chester Rush in the penthouse .
TED: Chester Rush ? The guy from The Wacky Detective ?
BETTY: Yeah , him and his entourage checked in last night . They 're in the penthouse . The only reason I refe to it as a variable is that he 's a movie star . Ya never know about movie stars . I 'm tellin ' ya , Ted , it 's cake .
TED: Okay .
BETTY: Great
TED: For fifty bucks .
BETTY: Fifty bucks !
TED: You 're shirking your duties for this Nazi . For that you pay a price , and the price is fifty bucks .
BETTY: One , Horst is not a Nazi . Two , that 's not a fair price . You 're taking advantage of the situation . Twenty ucks . Now , twenty bucks is a fai price .
TED: Yeah , but what you 're doin ' to me ai n't fair . And , you are completely and totally taking advantage of me and your position . So fifty bucks is the perfect price . Betty begrudgingly digs in her purse .
BETTY: Okay , but do n't be a pussy . You do n't other me unless it 's an emergency . In fact , for fifty bucks , you bette not call me unless the fuckin ' uilding 's burning down . She gives him the money .
ATHENA: Pleeze be careful my God . You have no idea

ELSPETH: What 'd I tell you about smoking ?
KIVA: You smoke .
ELSPETH: That 's right I smoke , and I 'm addicted to it , and I do n't want the same thing to happen to you .
KIVA: `` Hello welcome to this week 's edition of the Hypocrite of the Yea Award ``
ELSPETH: Kiva ! That 's enough
KIVA: You 're not my mother !
ELSPETH: Yes I am .
KIVA: Then why 're we sleeping together ?
ELSPETH: Well I did n't mean it literally . I I happen to be the only one who cares about you
KIVA: Why ?
ELSPETH: Because I said so .
KIVA: I 'll watch TV .
ELSPETH: You ca n't watch TV because the noise will interfere with our ritual .
KIVA: Okay Mommy .
ATHENA: Soon our goddess will come . I will go get her negligee .
ELSPETH: Kiva . My friend . Kiva , turn off the TV ! I ca n't leave her at home she 's on probation and I got ta keep an eye on her .
ATHENA: Well , Elspeth , your friend can not stay here during the ritual . She may e one of your kind , but she is not one of us .
ELSPETH: She stays ! ! Or I go along with my offering !
KIVA: Make me
ATHENA: Let 's not forget I am the High Fucking Priestess . Deal with dis girl !
ELSPETH: Kiva you know what I love about you ? Kiva smirks yeah , she knows .
KIVA: And what do I get if I 'm sweet ?
ELSPETH: You get whatever you want . And you know what else I love about you ?
KIVA: What ?
ELSPETH: Your nose .
JEZEBEL: Oh you little stinker oh you sweet little muffin . Yes Mama loves the aby .
ATHENA: I have sanctioned her presence , as long as she behaves . Come on there is more work to be done to welcome our great Diana .
ELSPETH: Why do I always attract girls who are looking for a babysitter ?
JEZEBEL: Well now , honey , maybe Juvenile Hall ai n't the best place to find serious elationship material .
RAVEN: I 'm looking for the room for making love .
TED: You might be referring to the Honeymoon Suite . Straight thata way you ca n't miss it see all that furniture in the hallway
RAVEN: Oh I know the way . I just wanted you to know that I knew where I was going and that you need n't bother yourself with me . The others are here great !
TED: Oh yeah it 's so great it 's fantastic .
RAVEN: Ohhh I know it all seems very strange but you 're coping with us much better than the bellboys of past New Year 's .
TED: Past New Year 's ?
RAVEN: Oh yes we 've been coming here every New Year for a long time . Thanks for your patience .
TED: Oh hey no problem wreck the place . Bring in cats . Ruin the carpet with flea powder , pour paint in the Jacuzzi . Throw the furniture out the where 're your bags ?
RAVEN: I travel very light .
TED: Yeah , yeah , Honeymoon Suite .
EVA: Oh yes I 'm late . She lowers her eyes , worried .
TED: All right lem me give ya a hand .
EVA: Oh no , that 's all right . I can carry them by myself .
TED: I 'm a man doin ' a job no hero . Eva smiles , beautifully .
EVA: Well gosh thank you !
TED: About an hour .
ATHENA: You are very late , Eva .
EVA: I 'm sorry , Athena . I was attending a irth and the placenta was late in coming .
ELSPETH: Which birth is more important to you , that of a mortal or that of a goddess ?
EVA: All life is precious but I do apologize for being late , Elspeth .
JEZEBEL: Back home , they jist yank on the umbilical cord , do a Karate chop on the mama 's belly , and them things come right out .
EVA: They do that here , too , Jezebel , in the hospitals , but it causes hemorrhages . I fed the mother a bowl of comfrey tea and it brought the afterbirth down perfectly . The couple are going to use it for fertilize to plant a lovely tree for thei aby .
KIVA: Oh wow if they were really back- to-nature , they 'd eat it , like othe mammals do .
RAVEN: In some Native American cultures , they dry the umbilical cord , grind it to a fine powder , and put it in a leather pouch that the baby wears to ward off evil . But burying the placenta is also a very sound ecological practice 'cause of the oxygen it carries .
EVA: Yes because you see when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall
TED: Uh , thank you , ladies I 'll be going now . If you need anything Eva places a nice tip in his palm .
ATHENA: Wait . We do need a few things .
TED: Yeah , yeah , rosemary .
ATHENA: And a little bit of sea salt or Koshe salt if you do n't got no sea salt . A ottle of spring water Italian please , not French shit .
KIVA: And some french fries !
ELSPETH: Kiva , shut up .
ATHENA: And some ginger , two of the eyes of a trout fish , and a piece of raw meat , liver if you have it .
KIVA: I want fries you dumb jerks with your stupid fucking ritual !
ATHENA: Shut up , you little shit .
ELSPETH: Do n't talk to her that way !
ATHENA: Get to work , man .
ELSPETH: Kiva
KIVA: What ?
ELSPETH: You have to go in the next room now .
KIVA: Oh , wow , like I 'm bummed out that I ca n't watch . I 'm bored !
ELSPETH: UP !
KIVA: Do n't put me in there by myself . I 'll miss you way too much .
ELSPETH: Kiva , do n't do this to me .
KIVA: Please if you just lem me I 'll play dress-up with you , the way you like it you know what I mean emember ?
ELSPETH: You mean like last week ?
KIVA: No !
JEZEBEL: Aw , really now child abuse ?
ELSPETH: You stay outta this !
ATHENA: I demand this stop now , Elspeth !
KIVA: I 'm running away from you !
ELSPETH: Fine . Go ahead . And I 'll call you parole officer and she 'll find you and send you back to Eastlake ! Kiva stomps off into the bedroom .
ATHENA: Now that the fucking melodrama is over , can we start the goddamn ritual pleeze ?
ELSPETH: To reverse the evil which has been done I make this offering to the Divine One A whore not , an innocent was , For whom I seized a virgin 's lood .
JEZEBEL: Goddess of Light , Goddess of Lust , To undo this awful spell is a real must . To bring you life and get you high I offer the sweat of five men 's thighs .
RAVEN: Diana , oh great one , we live without sun Until this wicked curse is undone . In hope that you live , and to us appear , I have collected a year 's worth of tears .
EVA: Great Goddess Diana , fail you I will , I was to bring fresh sperm from my Bill . I had him erect , and his semen would follow But alas I was hot , so hot that I swallowed .
ATHENA: You stupid little witch ! You swallowed the sperm ! Aye-yiyi !
ELSPETH: It just shows what an amazing lack of control you have over yourself , Eva !
JEZEBEL: Honey , why did n't you just use you hands ? Did n't your mama teach you not to put them things in your mouth ?
RAVEN: I understand though Eva bursts into tears . Athena is firm .
ATHENA: There is no time to cry over swallowed sperms . You 're gon na have to get some , baby . You have one hour to prove what kind of witch you really are . Just then a knock at the door .
TED: Ted the bellboy . Athena smiles and turns to Eva .
ATHENA: Mr. Bellboy , come right in !
TED: Here 's the things you asked for . Oh , and uhh , sorry , but I 'm not gon na pick the eyes outta this dead fish .
ATHENA: Okay , mister , here 's your fifty-dolla tip , only , you have to do one more thing make our little Eva smile . Can you ? We 'll leave you alone . And do n't use your mouth !
ELSPETH: If she does n't get his goop in ten minutes , I 'm going to take him myself .
JEZEBEL: Ha ! That 'll be a first for you .
ELSPETH: Oh shit Kiva !
KIVA: Well , gawd I need a candy bar o something you have n't fed me all day . I 'm getting all shaky . My blood sugar 's really low .
JEZEBEL: Elspeth honestly now some abysitter you 're turnin ' out ta be !

TED: Help me out , lady . I got ta earn this fifty bucks !
EVA: Oh look , they do n't care if I smile or not ! All they want is
TED: Try me . I 've been around , y'know .
EVA: Well okay . The five of us Elspeth , Jezebel , Athena , Raven and me are a coven .
TED: Ha , like a coven of witches ?
EVA: Yes .
TED: Oh .
EVA: And you see , our coven has spent forty years trying to perfect a ritual to undo a wicked curse put on ou goddess Diana .
TED: Gee , you do n't look a day over twenty !
EVA: Oh ha ha I mean the witches efore us tried and failed . But Athena , our High Priestess , discovered a great potion to reverse the evil spell which turned our beautiful goddess into an old rock .
TED: Yeah ? Is is that her ? Eva nods , looking lovingly at the stone .
EVA: She was a beautiful virgin . An entertainer by trade , but a great sorceress by design . It was here in this very room , on her wedding night , a jealous rival placed the curse on Diana .
TED: She turned to that here ?
EVA: Yes and her young husband turned into a pink fish ! They found him swimming in the pool in circles . While our dear goddess a stone in her honeymoon bed .
TED: This girl here ? This is the goddess Diana ?
EVA: Oh , but she was ! She had lovers , but she saved that for marriage . Which is the example I 've tried to follow to do everything but that till I marry She begins to sob again . Ted comforts her .
TED: Hey , do n't cry a virgin is a rare and beautiful thing . If you say she was a virgin , I 'll believe it .
EVA: Well , it does n't matter now and she wo n't be resurrected tonight 'cause I failed her . I let my whole coven down !
TED: Wait a sec that rock was gon na turn back into this ? He holds up the photo . Eva nods .
EVA: Only , not now we were each supposed to bring something a life fluid .
TED: If this is gon na be like one of those afterbirth conversations , I do n't think I wan na hear this .
EVA: Only I swallowed it
TED: You swallowed what ?
EVA: And now , you 're my last chance !
TED: Yeah , sure . Whoa , what ? You want my for the witchy poo ahh no no way nope . Besides , it 's against hotel policy . I was warned `` No sex with the clientele '' !
EVA: That 's not flea powder , that 's sacred dust ground from the horns of Albino goats .
TED: Right ! I knew that !
EVA: Well , see , what I really want to do is be a midwife . I 've attended fou irths already ! I can prevent vaginal tears and everything .
TED: Well , that 's a good thing ! A guy does n't like surprises down there .
EVA: I joined the coven to attain greate understanding of my feminine powe so I could become a truly great midwife !
TED: Oh , well , I see you 've been gaining a lot of insight into your girl powers
EVA: Do you really think so ?
TED: Well , yeah , I 'd say that seems to be the case Ohhh , God ! Betty 's gon na kill me !
EVA: Who 's Betty your girlfriend ?
TED: No . My boss .
EVA: Oh good !
TED: Oh no !
EVA: My phone number in Topanga . Call me ?
TED: Sure , baby . Yeah , I 'll give ya a call .
KIVA: What 's that used for ?
RAVEN: It 's a birch branch , symbolizing eternal life . You can also use the ark for a tea which assists in astral travel .
KIVA: Hey I wan na be a witch !
EVA: I 'm a woman now !
ATHENA: But where is his `` stuff '' ?
EVA: We did it right there , in the big cauldron !
JEZEBEL: Ooohhh honey , you 're gon na be sore tomorra ! Did n't your mama teach you that water strips a girl 's lubrication ?
RAVEN: Sex in water is great in the movies , not in real life but you will learn . As we all did .
JEZEBEL: Yeah , when she ca n't walk I guess you would n't have those kinds of problems without penetration .
ELSPETH: No . And virtually no cervical cancer , either .
ATHENA: Okay , girls , enough Sex Education 101 , let 's get going with our ritual , goddammit .
EVA: Goddess Diana , I offer you The jism of one I wooed for you That you may live and know such bliss Of getting laid by a guy like this . The witches all incant .
ATHENA: I do n't understand what went wrong .
ELSPETH: I say Eva pulled one over on us .
EVA: What ?
JEZEBEL: Honey Eva was wearing the face of someone just fucked good and the est actress in this world , or any other , ca n't fake a thing like that !
ELSPETH: Exactly if she was fucked so good , how could she save his come ?
RAVEN: It could be done
ATHENA: Girls , knock it off . Maybe maybe it needed to be the sperm of a virgin male .
EVA: He was no virgin !
ATHENA: Let 's leave her here , with the sword , until dawn . I will come back for he efore checkout time . I just feel too sad to carry her away before the sun comes up to warm her .
JEZEBEL: I ca n't believe we have to carry ou own bags out ! My mama would have a hissy fit !
KIVA: I 'll carry your bags .
ELSPETH: You 're carrying my bags !
ATHENA: Next year , we try again with virgin sperm .
TED: Oh , Jesus , what did I tell you ? Do you want milk and cookies , or do you not ? I ca n't turn on an adult station without permission from your parents . That 's not what the machine tells me .

TED: I did n't say that I
SIGFRIED: Oh , for Christ 's sake , Theodore , this is about as intimate a situation as you can get , you , me , and Angela here . It 's pretty cozy . To say nothing of how stupid an idea it is to lie to a man with a loaded gun without considering the possible response . I demand an apology ! The phone rings .
TED: I apologize
SIGFRIED: For what ?
TED: That I said you might have been unfaithful ?
SIGFRIED: `` That I said you might have been unfaithful ? '' Listen , Theodore , you 're in church here you 're kneeling in front of an altar . Truth truth is all it hears . Say the following , `` I , Theodore , must humbly and sincerely apologize for saying that you fucked another man ! ''
TED: You mind if I ?

SIGFRIED: That you think I 'm an idiot .
TED: I would never say that .
SIGFRIED: You think you 're superior to me , do n't ya , Theodore ? You do n't think I notice there is a gag in the woman 's mouth .
TED: Of course you do .
SIGFRIED: Naturally `` of course . '' And do you know how I know that ?

TED: What !
ANGELA: We do n't have time to play charades here , asshole ! Untie me quick .
TED: Listen , lady , I do n't know what in the hell is going on here , but I 'd appreciate it if you would explain to that nutcase that he 's making a ig mistake .
ANGELA: Look , whether you like it or not , you 're in the middle of a situation here you ca n't just wish your way out of .
TED: But I 've never seen you people before , we 're complete strangers .
ANGELA: Everyone starts out strangers , Ted , it 's where we end up that counts . Hurry up .
TED: I do n't know if I can do this . It 's too hard .
ANGELA: Life is hard , Ted . You ever stopped to consider how many times you change your underwear in a lifetime ?
TED: What ?
ANGELA: Forget it , listen to me . There 's a gun in my suitcase behind the bed , it 's loaded
TED: I 'm not going to shoot anybody .
ANGELA: Fine . Get the gun and I 'll shoot `` anybody . ''
TED: And make me an accessory in the murde of your husband ?
ANGELA: Get a fucking grip on yourself . First off , who says he 's my husband ? And second , we are a long way from fai here , fair is back in jolly old England eatin ' crumpets and sipping on tea . Ted collects himself .
TED: Tut . Tut . Tut . Not so fast . Well , maybe there are two sides to this thing .
ANGELA: There are two sides to a plate , still you only eat off of one . Now GET THE
TED: So why 's he got you tied up ?
ANGELA: I 'm a werewolf , Ted ! Get the gun !
TED: Nine thousand , three hundred and twenty-two times , to the best of my estimation .
SIGFRIED: I was just beginning to think I could trust you , Theodore . Silly me . Ted 's fingers are frozen over Angela 's lips .
TED: I was just trying to help her breathe a little .
SIGFRIED: Do n't let me stop you , Teddy . You do n't mind me calling you Teddy , do you ?
TED: That 's fine .
SIGFRIED: I used to have a little bunny rabbit named Teddy , it looked real cute nibbling on Angela 's ear . Only problem here is you 're no bunny rabbit , Theodore , and it really fuckin ' razzes me to picture you doin ' it . But do n't let me stop you , Teddy no need to play sneaky-poo . Ted starts to back toward the door .
TED: Look , man , if this is some kind of Voodoo thing and you want me to have sex with your wife , there is absolutely no way .
SIGFRIED: I said , nibble , asshole ! Now !
TED: Sorry , lady .
SIGFRIED: What 's the matter , no whiz left in the cheese ? I 'm not cramping you style , am I ?

ANGELA: Where 's the fucking nitro ?
TED: I could n't find it !
ANGELA: You took long enough . Untie me , fo Christ 's sake , you fucking upset him and he 's dying . Ted struggles to untie Angela .
TED: I thought you wanted to kill him .
ANGELA: You 'd make a great cop , Theodore .
TED: I ca n't handle this alone , I 'd bette get help .
SIGFRIED: I tie a pretty good knot , do n't I , Ted ?
TED: Thank God you 're okay
SIGFRIED: Never felt better .
ANGELA: You bastard !
SIGFRIED: Come on , honey , do n't get mad . It was just a little test , and I 'm glad I did it because now I 'll know foreve that you really do love me . Truly and deeply .
ANGELA: If the simple fact that I did n't want your bloated , dead body lying out on the floor is love , then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this very fucking moment .
SIGFRIED: Oh , no . I heard you and there was genuine care in that voice . Ca n't be denied . Can it , Ted ?
TED: I think you 're right and , if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going , you 'll go a long way to esolving this misunderstanding . Ted edges his way toward the door .
ANGELA: You heard shit , monkey boy . Easy fo you to say after you fuck anothe man 's wife . You should at least have the guts to stand by your convictions .
TED: That 's a lie , Sigfried . I swear to God . Angela continues her tirade .
ANGELA: When I think of all the times you were inside me promising me a bette life , it makes me want to puke .
TED: Why are you doing this ? What have I ever done to you people ?
ANGELA: What did n't you do , stick man ? Unfortunately , you do n't have the alls to back up the actions of you huge cock .
SIGFRIED: He 's got a huge cock ?
TED: She 's lying again , mister . It 's not that big .
SIGFRIED: Show it to me .
TED: Come on , man , she 's lying . Ca n't you see she 's fucking with you ?
ANGELA: Put it this way , God made up fo what he did to Gumby with Ted here .
SIGFRIED: Show it to me .
ANGELA: Show him your cock , Theodore .
SIGFRIED: Stop talking about his cock , will you ? !
ANGELA: It 's hard to stop talking about something so huge . I could go on and on about his cock , bone , nob , bishop , wang , thang , hotrod . Hump mobile , Oscar , dong , dagger , banana , cucumber , salami . Sausage , kielbasa , schlong , dink , tool , Big Ben , Mister Happy , prick , disk , pecker , peter , pee-pee , wee-wee , weiner , pisser , pistol , joint , hose , horn , middle-leg , third- leg , meat , stick , joystick , dipstick .
SIGFRIED: Please , do n't leave me . I 'll call you Ted from now on .
TED: It 's not me , mister , I swear .
SIGFRIED: Personally , I do n't give a fuck , Ted , it 's just I do n't want to be alone right now . I 'm feeling a little vulnerable .
TED: That 's beautiful .
SIGFRIED: Kind of nice down here on the floor , is n't it , Ted ?
TED: Yes , actually .
SIGFRIED: Things take on a whole new perspective You 'd like my trust , would n't you , Ted ?
TED: Yes I would .
SIGFRIED: I just got one thing to ask you and I 'll let you go .
TED: Okay . Okay .
SIGFRIED: Tell me straight now .
TED: What ?
SIGFRIED: What was it like ?
TED: What was what like ?
SIGFRIED: You know , you and her .
TED: Oh , for fuck sake , Sigfried , what do you want me to say ?
SIGFRIED: Either way you 're fucked , right ? You ever gon na see her again , Theodore ?
TED: If I ever saw her again , I 'd run the other way .
SIGFRIED: Promise ?
TED: I promise . Sigfried releases Ted and stands up .
SIGFRIED: You 're lying , but I can respect that , Ted . If you told me , it would no longer be a secret , and secrets have a power , kid . You open that box and they disappear forever . A bad secret will rip you apart , but the good one are all you got . In the end , when all the people you knew are dead and gone , all you 'll have left are you secrets . And when you die , the box is open and it all blows away dust to dust all the anger , jealousy , desire and love just blow away . Sigfried throws his hand out to help Ted up .
TED: I can see that .
SIGFRIED: Maybe to a fault .
TED: Do n't beat yourself up over it .
SIGFRIED: That 's nice of you to say , Ted , but I probably should make a clean break of it , cut her loose and get my own place . I just ca n't imagine living without her . Do you think I should seek professional help ?
TED: It 's not for everyone , but maybe in your case it could help .
SIGFRIED: You ever been out on the ocean at night ? Ted shakes his head .
ANGELA: You 'd better go check to see if I killed anybody downstairs .
TED: You people gon na be okay ?
ANGELA: We 're fine , Ted .
TED: Would you like me to ?
ANGELA: Another time , Ted .
YOUNG GUY: Happy New Year , buddy .
TED: Happy New Year .
YOUNG GUY: I was just in room 404 , what a party ! You know where room 409 is at ?
TED: Beats me . It 's somewhere around here .
TED: Front desk .
MAN: Bottle of Moet et Chandon . Fast .
WIFE: There . Go . Sarah exits .
MAN: Hey .
WIFE: Here in the room ? By themselves ?
MAN: No with the television .
WIFE: Yes .
MAN: They 'll be fine .
SARAH: Why did we have to get all dressed up if we were n't going with them ?
SARAH: What are you doing ?
JUANCHO: Escaping . Stinks in here , anyway .
MAN: What did I say ?
JUANCHO: Yes , Papa . Ted appears at the door with Man 's champagne .
TED: The champagne you ordered , sir .
MAN: No time for this . Leave it on ice .
WIFE: But I want some now Ted is torn . Man pushes him into the room .
MAN: There 'll be plenty for you and the party , baby , you can bomb yourself all you want at the party .
WIFE: What a waste .
MAN: Hey . Ted looks around , bewildered . Now what ? Man is reaching into his coat pocket .
TED: Sure !
MAN: How about three ?
TED: Three hundred ?
MAN: Yeah .
TED: Three 's good .
MAN: My children are staying here tonight watching TV . I want you to check up on them every thirty minutes .
TED: Check up on 'em ?
MAN: Make sure they 're all right , make sure they 're fed , make sure they go to bed .
TED: We can call out and hire a babysitter .
MAN: I do n't trust babysitters . My children are safer alone than with some fucked- up pedophile babysitter I do n't know from the man in the fucking moon .
WIFE: What about him ? What makes you think you can trust him ?
MAN: Tell me that 's not a face you can trust .
TED: Look , sir , I 'd like to help you out , ut I really ca n't . I 'm all alone here tonight .
MAN: One hundred two hundred three hundred
TED: I thought you said five hundred . Man glares at Ted .
MAN: I said three hundred . Ted does n't back down .
TED: No , you distinctly said five hundred . The angrier Man gets , the quieter he talks .
MAN: You calling me a liar ?
TED: No , I 'm not saying you 're lying . I 'm saying you accidentally forgot that what you first said was five hundred .
MAN: I do n't do anything accidentally , jerk . I might 've first said five hundred , but what I last said was three hundred , and what you say last is what counts .
TED: Well then , if you say five hundred one last time , we got a deal .
MAN: You fuckin ' with me , Pendejo ? Now Ted takes a step backwards .
TED: No , not at all . It 's New Year 's Eve and I 'm here alone . If there was somebody else here , no problem , but I 'm by myself . And looking afte your kids is a pain in the ass I do n't need
MAN: You callin ' my kids a pain in the ass ?
TED: No , they 're not a pain in the ass , it 's the situation that 's a pain in the ass . Man drops the tenseness .
MAN: No , you were right the first time . You win , tough guy , five hundred .
WIFE: You kids are getting expensive . Juancho turns back to the TV . Sarah stares down Wife .
MAN: What 's your name ? Ted ? CLOSE-UP of name tag .
TED: Yeah . It 's Ted .
MAN: His name is Ted . If you need anything , dial 0 and ask for Ted .
MAN: If something happens to my children , I would n't want to be you .
WIFE: Make sure they 're in bed before midnight .
TED: Before midnight ? Then should I wake them up for the countdown to the New Year ? Wife looks disgusted .
WIFE: No
MAN: Do n't misbehave . Man closes the door .
TED: Okay . These are the rules . Do n't eak the rules and I wo n't break your necks . The kids look at each other .
SARAH: That 's not what he said .
TED: Well , I 've got a lot of work to do and I ca n't have you calling me every time you want a drink of water , so please limit your calls to emergencies only .
SARAH: We paid you five hundred dollars . We 'll call you if we need anything . You do n't want to upset my dad .
TED: Okay . Please . Try to call only when necessary . Watch TV , and if you 're good , I 'll bring up some milk and cookies . Bye . Ted leaves .
SARAH: Your feet stink . Juancho smells his feet .
JUANCHO: They do n't stink .
SARAH: Change it . You 're not supposed to watch this .
JUANCHO: We 're supposed to watch TV .
SARAH: Not this kind of TV . Change it .
TED: Front desk .
SARAH: Ted ? Hi . It 's me , Sarah . You 're ou sitter for tonight .
TED: Oh , Jesus , what did I tell you ? I said if you do n't bother me , you 'll get milk and cookies . Now , do you want them or do you not ?
SARAH: I want you to turn off the Nudie station in our room . Ted checks the computer .
TED: I ca n't turn on an adult station without permission from your parents .
SARAH: No . Not turn it on , turn it off . It 's already on .
TED: That 's not what the machine tells me .
SARAH: Well , stop listening to the machine and listen to me . There 's naked ladies dancing on my TV and I want 'em off .
TED: If you 're good , you 'll get milk and cookies , so leave me alone , please . I 'll be up later to put you both to sleep . He hangs up .
SARAH: Change the channel , now !
JUANCHO: Man , you 're the one with the stinky feet . Sarah smells her feet . Twice .
SARAH: They do n't stink .
JUANCHO: Yeah , they do .
SARAH: Here , smell for yourself .
JUANCHO: Hey , get a bottle opener !
SARAH: Do n't shake it ! Ted ? Hi . It 's me . Sarah .
TED: Yeah . Who died ? No one ? Then do n't call me .
SARAH: I thought I 'd tell you that you cleaning ladies are doing a bum job . There 's all kinds of leftover stuff around here .
JUANCHO: 4-0-9 .
SARAH: Hello ? Hi . You do n't know me , and I do n't know you , but do you have any needles ? We 've got needles here and I was wondering if they come with the room or not . Do n't have any ? Thanks . Just checking . She hangs up .
SARAH: The center is the bull 's eye , 100 points , this one 's 10 points , this one 's 20 points .
TED: I brought you some milk and cookies . If you want some you have to eat them now , because you 're going to sleep .
SARAH: We 're going to sleep now ?
TED: Your parents said put you to bed efore midnight . Well , it 's before midnight . Maybe that way you 'll leave me alone .
SARAH: Those are n't milk and cookies .
TED: We were out of cookies , so I brought you milk and Saltines . Do n't complain ! Now hurry up and eat . You 're going to bed right now .
JUANCHO: These are old .
SARAH: They 're stale .
TED: Dip 'em in the milk ! The milk will make them soft .
JUANCHO: What about our pajamas ?
TED: You wan na look nice in case there 's an earthquake , don'tcha ? The children nod .
SARAH: What 's that ?
TED: Oh , this is just some Mentholatum ointment . Come on , under the covers . Close your eyes and I 'll tell you a story .
JUANCHO: What happens when it 's morning ?
TED: If you keep your eyes closed all night , it will wear off by morning . But DO N'T OPEN YOUR EYES BEFORE
SARAH: Did you ever open your eyes ? Extreme CLOSE-UP on Ted 's eyes .
TED: Yes I did . The children are quiet .
CHILDREN: We ca n't .
TED: Good . You 'll do just fine . Sleep well and I wo n't tell your parents about the champagne . Ted leaves .
JUANCHO: Are you watching TV ?
SARAH: Yep . If you wan na watch too , you have to go wash your face .
SARAH: Ted !
TED: What do you want now , for Christ 's sake ! Who died ?
SARAH: I do n't know , but she 's in my bed !
TED: What ?
SARAH: There 's a dead body in my bed !
TED: That 's just your brother . Sound asleep .
SARAH: No , there 's a woman 's dead body inside the bed , in the mattress .
TED: You saw the body ?
SARAH: Yes !
TED: Impossible . You 've got ointment on your eyes ! You ca n't see shit ! Now go to sleep ! Ted hangs up the phone . Sarah redials . Ted answers .
SARAH: I washed it off
TED: You washed off the ointment ?
SARAH: Yeah , did n't you ever think to do that ? Ted is quiet on the line . Thinking .
TED: All right . Now you listen to me
SARAH: Get your ass up here and call the police , because there 's a dead body in my bed and it smells like shit and it looks even worse , and if you do n't help us , my dad is gon na lay you down right next to her , I swea to fucking God !
JUANCHO: Go , sis . She 's drunk all right .

MAN: Did they misbehave ?
GUINNESS GIRL: Happy New Year !
TED: Let me speak to Betty .
GUINNESS GIRL: Party 's over , she probably went home .
TED: She lives there .
GUINNESS GIRL: Oh , well , I have n't seen 'em in a while .
TED: Do you even know who I 'm talking about ?
GUINNESS GIRL: Yeah yeah yeah I know 'em , I know Eddy .
TED: Betty , not Eddy .
GUINNESS GIRL: Yeah yeah I know Betty too Tall
TED: No , not particularly . She 's got curly ed hair .
GUINNESS GIRL: No , no , no , no , no , I know , I know . Japanese girl .
TED: She 's not Japanese ! I just said she had red hair .
GUINNESS GIRL: Yeah yeah yeah I know her .
TED: Well , then get her on the phone , it 's an emergency .
GUINNESS GIRL: Who who should I say 's calling ?
TED: Tell 'em Teddy from work 's on the phone , and it 's a major fuckin ' emergency .
GUINNESS GIRL: Gotcha , Betty from work .
TED: Not Betty from work , I 'm calling Betty ! I 'm Teddy . Just say Ted .
GUINNESS GIRL: Hi , Ted , I 'm Margaret . You sound down . Has this not been the happiest of New Year 's ?
TED: No Margaret , this has n't been my est New Year . This year 's starting off pretty badly .
MARGARET: Awww , how come ?
TED: Well , Betty the chick whose house you 're at , even though you do n't know her leaves me here all by myself on New Year 's Eve . And first thing right off the bat , I 'm fucked y a coven of witches .
MARGARET: An oven full of witches fucked you ? Is that like at the circus when they stick all those clowns in an itty- itty car ?
TED: A coven . A coven of witches . Well , one witch in particular .
MARGARET: Was she an old hag with a mole , with hair growing out of it ?
TED: No-no-no , she was quite beautiful . Margaret thinks for a moment .
MARGARET: Ted ?
TED: Yes .
MARGARET: What 's the problem ?
TED: Well , admittedly , that was the best part of the night . It was pretty fuckin ' cool , actually . But it was still an unnerving way to start off the night .
MARGARET: Sounds to me like a pretty great way to start off the night .
TED: Okay , let 's just skip over the witches .
MARGARET: Skipping over the witches .
TED: So , later , in another room , some crazy sucking maniac sticks a gun in my face and forces me to play out some psychosexual drama with his wife .
MARGARET: He made you have psycho sex with his wife ?
TED: No , he did n't make me fuck his wife , he thought I 'd fucked his wife ! He held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun !
MARGARET: What kinda gun ?
TED: I do n't know , I 'm not a gun guy . It was big .
MARGARET: Like Dirty Harry 's gun .
TED: Yeah , something like that .
MARGARET: Did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel ?
TED: What difference does it make ?
MARGARET: Well , for one thing it 's the difference between a .44 Magnum and a Magnum .357 .
TED: Who cares if it was a .44 or a .392 , it was a fuckin ' loaded gun , pointed at my fuckin ' head ! Margaret takes this in .
MARGARET: You wan na skip over this part , too ?
TED: I want you to get Betty on the phone !
MARGARET: Hold on . Anybody live here named What 's her name again ?
TED: Betty .
MARGARET: Betty !
BETTY: Yeah , whatcha screamin ' about ?
MARGARET: You 're Betty ?
BETTY: Yeah , I 'm Betty , it 's my fuckin ' place , who the fuck are you ?
MARGARET: I 'm Margaret And this is Ted . Betty takes the phone .
BETTY: Ted , what 's the problem ?
TED: What 's the problem ? I do n't got a problem , I got fuckin ' problems ! Wan na hear ?
BETTY: Sure .
TED: Well , most recently , there 's room 716 . There 's a scary Mexican gangste dude pokin ' his finger in my chest . There 's his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me . There 's the putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore stuffed in the springs of a bed . There 're rooms blazing afire There 's a needle from God knows where stuck in my leg , infecting me with God knows what , and finally , there 's me walking out the fuckin ' door right now ! Buenas noches .
BETTY: Is that the penthouse ?
TED: Yeah .
BETTY: That 's the Chester Rush party , they want something .
TED: Yeah , well , tough titty . They 're just gon na have to wait , 'cause I 'm out the door .
BETTY: Now , Ted , wait a minute . I know you 're freaked , I know you 're stressed . You 've had a real bad night
TED: Yes , Betty , I 've had-a-real-bad-night
BETTY: You say there 's a dead body in a oom ?
TED: Yes , I did .
BETTY: No problem , this is a hotel , we 've had dead bodies before , it 's just the price of doing business . You said the hotel was on fire . Is it still on fire ?
TED: No , it 's out .
BETTY: Good , sprinkler system worked like a charm . Now , you wan na leave , you 've had enough . Perfectly understandable . I 'll take care of everything else . The only thing I ask is that you take care of Chester Rush . Then you can leave .
TED: Now , look
BETTY: Ted , he 's a very important guest of this hotel . In fact , he is the most important guest at the hotel . The Mon Signor used to be a haven fo movie stars . Through the thirties and forties , and the first half of the fifties , more movie stars if you break it down on a night-by-night asis stayed at the Mon Signo than any other hotel in Hollywood . Now , we had some hard time in the eighties , even though we were the official hotel of Cannon Pictures , ut we 're coming back strong in the nineties . And a movie star clientele is important to that comeback . If we can keep stars of his magnitude happy , we 're on our way . So , Ted , just take care of him , then you can leave .
TED: Look , I do n't feel like
BETTY: He probably just wants some champagne ! You can do that , ca n't you ? Please just take care of him , the entire staff of the Mon Signor is begging you ! Ted crumbles .
TED: Okay . But get your ass here pronto .
BETTY: You 're a good man , Ted . Thanks .
TED: Hello , Mr . Rush . Sorry for the delay . How can I help you ?
ANGELA: Hi , Theodore .
TED: What the hell are you doing here ? She holds up the drink she has in her hand .
ANGELA: Having a drink .
TED: Is that crazy husband of yours in there ?
ANGELA: Are you kidding , he 'll be asleep till Christmas . From behind her we hear
CHESTER: Entrez , entrez , come in , come in .
TED: Hi , sorry I took so long , but I got everything you asked for
CHESTER: Not a problem , my friend Mr. Bellboy .
ANGELA: His name 's Theodore .
TED: Actually , it 's not Theodore , It 's Ted . Chester rises from the couch .
CHESTER: So , Ted the Bellboy , as I was saying would you care for some champagne ? That 's not what I was saying , but would you care for some champagne ?
TED: No , thank you .
CHESTER: Ya sure ? Cristal . It 's the best . I never liked champagne before I had Cristal , now I love it .
TED: Okay , yeah , sure . As Chester goes and pours Ted a glass
CHESTER: As I was saying , Ted , do n't worry about being late . For our purposes , promptness is far behind thoroughness . On `` thoroughness , '' he hands Ted the glass .
TED: Thank you ?
CHESTER: No , not thank you . Whadya say about the tasty beverage ?
TED: It 's good .
CHESTER: Fuckin ' good , Ted . It 's fuckin ' good . Let 's try it again , shall we ? So , Ted , whadya think about the beverage .
TED: It 's fuckin ' good .
CHESTER: You bet your sweet bippy , Ted . It 's fuckin ' Cristal , everything else is piss . Norman in the chair starts yelling at Ted .
NORMAN: Bellboy ! Bellboy ! Bellboy ! Ted knows he 's being laughed at , but not why .
CHESTER: Knock it off , you 're making my friend Ted here uneasy . Pay no attention to Norman here , Ted , he 's just fuckin ' wit ' ya , that 's all . That 's from Quadrophenia . Now me , myself , when I think of bellboys I think of `` bellboy '' is n't an insult , is it ? Is there another name for what you do that I 'm ignorant of ? Bellman , bellperson
TED: Bellboy 's fine .
CHESTER: Good . I 'm glad they have n't changed that . There 's a friendliness to `` bellboy . '' As I was saying , Ted , when Norman thinks of bellboys , he thinks of Quadrophenia .
TED: No .
CHESTER: You should , it 's one of Jerry 's bette movies . He never says a word through the entire film . A completely silent performance . How many actors can pull that off ? And he has to go to France to get respect . That says it all about America right there . The minute Jerry Lewis dies , every pape in this fuckin ' country gon na write articles calling the man a genius . It 's not right . It 's not right and it 's not fair . But why should that surprise anybody ? When has America ever been fair ? We might be right every once in a while , but we 're very rarely fair .
TED: Where do you want this ?
CHESTER: You in a hurry , Ted ?
TED: No , not particularly .
CHESTER: Good , then stop playing `` Beat the Clock . '' Now let me introduce you to everybody .
ANGELA: Oh , me and Theodore go way back . Do n't we , Theodore ?
TED: The name 's Ted , Angela . I only let people with loaded guns at my head call me Theodore .
CHESTER: Angela 's like you , Ted , a newfound friend .
ANGELA: We met at the pool .
CHESTER: Have you ever seen Angela in a one- piece ?
TED: No .
CHESTER: Well , it 's somethin ' to see . The Man sitting in the chair , with the bottle of Jim Bean in his hand and the sense of humor , is Norman . Norman , say hello to Ted .
NORMAN: What 's up ? Norman shakes his hand .
CHESTER: The sociable son of a bitch on the telephone is Leo . And the person on the other end of the phone is his lovely wife Ellen . Leo , say hello to Ted .
LEO: Hi , Ted , glad you could make it . What ? What does punctuality have to do with love ?
CHESTER: Which brings me to me , Chester Rush , Ted . Pleased to meetcha . Chester shakes Ted 's hand .
TED: I know . I 'm sorry I have n't seen your movie . Chester stops . Ted wonders if he should have said that .
CHESTER: It 's quite all right , Ted , nothing to feel sorry about . That 's why God invented video . But you know , Ted , a lot of people did see it .
NORMAN: What 's wrong , Chester ?
CHESTER: It 's fuckin ' flat , Norman , that 's what 's wrong . The champagne the fuckin ' Cristal 's fuckin ' flat .
LEO: 72.1 million . You okay , champ ?
CHESTER: I 'm cool , so talk to your wife .
TED: The Dog Catcher . They both drink .
CHESTER: Now let 's stroll over here and see what goodies you brought us .
TED: Do you mind me asking what 's all this stuff for ?
CHESTER: One thing at a time , Ted . I 'm not a frog and you 're not a bunny , so let 's not jump ahead . C'mon , Norman , you should be interested in this .
NORMAN: Damn Skippy ! Tell it . Ted produces the things they called for .
TED: A block of wood . Chester knocks on it .
CHESTER: Good .
TED: Three nails .
NORMAN: Why three nails ?
CHESTER: That 's how many Peter Lorre asked for . Continue , Ted . Ted is completely bewildered .
TED: A roll of twine .
CHESTER: That 's definitely a roll of twine . Continue .
TED: A bucket of ice .
CHESTER: You into it ?
NORMAN: I 'm into it .
CHESTER: Go on .
TED: A donut . Chester takes it and eats it .
CHESTER: That 's for me . Continue .
TED: And a hatchet .
CHESTER: A hatchet as sharp as the devil himself is what I asked for .
TED: Well , you be the judge .
NORMAN: I 'll be the judge .
CHESTER: Whadya think ?
NORMAN: That 's a sharp motherfucker . Bring all this bullshit over to the bar .
CHESTER: You heard him , Ted .
LEO: Bitch !
NORMAN: You still married ?
LEO: Maybe , maybe not , but I do n't give a flyin ' fuck either way . I 've had it with that Machiavellian bitch ! I 'm too drunk to drive home . I 'm sorry about that , I 'm real sorry about that . I got drunk on New Year 's Eve , cut my fuckin ' head off What 's going on here ?
CHESTER: We now return you to The Man from Rio , already in progress .
LEO: Noooo , you 're gon na do it ?
NORMAN: Looks like .
LEO: You guys ai n't bullshittin ' , you 're gon na really go for it ? Angela is still curled up .
ANGELA: After talkin ' about it all night , they better . I wan na see a show .
CHESTER: When we do it , you 'll have something to see .
LEO: You are one radical dude .
TED: Well , that 's everything , so if you do n't need me for anything else , I 'll go back downstairs .
CHESTER: Not so fast , Ted . We ai n't quite done yet . Why do n't you take a seat at the bar , get comfortable , and have an open mind when we explain the festivities of the evening to you .
TED: Look , guys , you paid for the room . As long as you do n't break up the furniture , you can do whatever the fuck you want . And me personally , I do n't care if you break up the furniture . You do n't have to explain anything to me . Whatever constitutes a good time as far as you guys are concerned is your business .
CHESTER: Well , it 's your business , Ted . 'Cause we want you to take part .
TED: Take part in what ?
LEO: Chester , your way of breaking the news to him gently is scarin ' the shit outta him .
ANGELA: Look at the poor guy . Just spit it out .
CHESTER: First off , let me say that there 's nothing homosexual about what we 're going to ask you to do . There 's nothing sexual at all about what we want . But I was thinkin ' you might e thinkin ' we want you to do some sex thing . Pee on us , suck us off , shit like that . Let me assure you nothing could be farther from what we want Angela interrupts
ANGELA: Can I jump in here ?
CHESTER: No , you ca n't jump in here , this is my story .
ANGELA: Theodore 's been here fifteen minutes and you 've talked about everything ut .
CHESTER: Hey , if you do n't like it , you can get the fuck out .
LEO: If it 'll please the court , let me explain to Ted our intentions .
NORMAN: I second the nomination !
CHESTER: Move the nomination be closed !
LEO: Thank you . Ted , did you ever watch the old `` Alfred Hitchcock Show '' ?
TED: Yeah .
LEO: Did you ever see the episode The Man from Rio , with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen ?
TED: I do n't think so .
LEO: Oh , you 'd remember it all right . In the show , Peter Lorre makes a bet that Steve McQueen ca n't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a ow . Now if Steve McQueen can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a ow , he wins Peter Lorre 's new car . If he ca n't he loses his little finger . Norman and Chester just made the same bet . Norman 's putting up his pinky against Chester 's mint convertible , 1964 red convertible Chevy Corvelle that he can light his Zippo ten times in a ow . Pause .
TED: You guys are drunk .
CHESTER: Well , that goes without saying , but that does n't mean we do n't know what we 're doing .
NORMAN: I 'll tell ya what I 'm doin ' .
CHESTER: Cristal . When you 're drinkin ' anything else , you 're drinking champagne . When you 're drinkin ' Cristal , you say you 're drinkin ' Cristal .
NORMAN: drinkin ' Cristal . Watchin ' TV . `` Rockin ' New Year 's Eve . '' When all of a sudden we flip on Steve McQueen and Peter Lorre bein ' fuckin ' badass . And I look at this funny motherfucke over here , and I say , `` I 'd do that for the Chevelle . ''
LEO: And Chester replies
CHESTER: `` Oh , really ? ''
TED: You guys would n't be doin ' something this stupid unless you were drunk . Everybody breaks into a `` here , here '' murmur .
NORMAN: I think that pretty much goes without sayin ' . We 'd probably chicken out . But when you 're fucked-up , you do n't lie . You tell the fuckin ' truth . And the fuckin ' truth is , my lucky Zippo 's gon na win me Chester 's car .
TED: Why are you doing this ?
CHESTER: Thrill of the bet . I 'm the one with something to lose here . 'Cause I can pretty near guarantee that I love my car more ' n Norman loves his pinky .
TED: How 'bout you guys , you 're just gon na sit back and let your friends mutilate each other ?
LEO: Why not ? Life do n't get much more exciting than this . I mean if Norman was puttin ' his dick on the choppin ' lock , I 'd step in , 'cause , ya know in the morning , we 'd really regret that . But his pinky ? Who gives a fuck ? I mean theoretically , he could lose that choppin ' onions tomorrow . Life still goes on .
TED: How 'bout you ?
ANGELA: I do n't care .
CHESTER: Which brings us to your part in this little wager .
TED: I do n't have a part .
CHESTER: Now , Ted , my old granddaddy used ta say `` The less a man makes declarative statements , the less he 's apt to look foolish in retrospect . '' Now there 're some inherent obstacles in this undertaking . First of all , I 'm not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre on that show , travelin ' the countryside collecting fingers . We 're all buddies , here . Nobody wants Norman to lose his finger . We just wan na chop it off . So if fate does n't smile on ol ' Norman , we 'll put his finge on ice and rush 'im to a hospital , where in all likelihood be able to sew it back on .
TED: Hopefully .
LEO: Eighty percent .
NORMAN: Our side .
CHESTER: So Norman 's protected . His interests have been looked after . My interests , on the other hand , have not . I am as emotionally attached to my car as Norman is physically to his finger . I 'm putting up a very expensive piece of machinery on this wager . Now , if I lose , I lose , I have no problem with that . I 'm a big boy , I knew what I was doing . However , if I win , I wan na win . If Norman lights his lighter ten times in a row , he 's gon na have no emotional problems about taking my car keys whatsoever . But if I win , it 's not inconceivable that Leo or myself , at the last minute , might not be able to wield the ax . Which brings us full circle to you , Ted . Sober Ted . Clear-eyed Ted . We want you to be the diceman .
ANGELA: Helluva night , huh , Ted ?
TED: I got ta get out of here .
CHESTER: Ted , I got a hundred-dollar bill here with your name on it , whethe you do what we ask or not , just to sit back down in the chair for one minute more . Ted spins in his direction .
TED: I 'm not gon na cut off his finger !
CHESTER: Maybe you will and maybe you wo n't , ut that has nothing to do with this hundred-dollar bill in my hand . You can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that door . But if you sit back down and wait sixty seconds efore you do it , you 'll be a hundred dollars richer . Ted just stands across the room , thinking .
ANGELA: Ted . Take the money .
LEO: Ted , you 're gon na do whatever you want to do . We 're just askin ' you to indulge us for another minute more . And Chester 's willin ' to pay for it . Ted thinks .
TED: I 'll take your money , and I 'll sit ack down . But a minute from now , I 'm gon na walk out the door , and when I do , there 'll be no hard feelings ?
CHESTER: Well , I want you to have a bit more of an open mind than that , but , yeah , we 'll either convince you or we wo n't . No hard feelings . Right , guys ? Everybody agrees . Ted wearily sits back down .
LEO: You got it . Gentlemen , start your engines . Chester jumps up and down , loosening up .
CHESTER: Okay , pay attention here , Ted , I ai n't got much time . Now I 'm gon na make two piles here on the bar . One pile , which is yours . And another pile , which could be yours . Now , what you have to be aware of is we 're gon na do this bet , one way , or the other . Whether it 's you who holds the ax , or the desk clerk downstairs , or some bum we yank off the street .
NORMAN: You can buy a lot of soup with that pile .
CHESTER: Shhhh , I 'm the closer . How much is on the bar already ? I lost count .
ANGELA: Six hundred .
CHESTER: Six hundred . Ted , do you know how long it takes the average American to count to six hundred ?
TED: No .
CHESTER: One minute less than it takes to count to seven hundred . You know , Ted , a person 's life is made up of a zillion little experiences . Some , which have no meaning , are insignificant and you forget them . And some that stick with you for the est of your natural life barring Alzheimer 's of course . Now , what we 're proposing is so unusual , so outside the norm , that I think it would be a pretty good guess that this will be one of those experiences that sticks . So , since you 're gon na be stuck remembering this moment for the rest of you life , you got ta decide what that memory will be . So , are you gon na remember for the next forty years , give or take a decade , how you refused a thousand dollars for one second 's worth of work , or how you made a thousand dollars for one second 's worth of work ?
LEO: Time !
CHESTER: Well , Ted , what 's it gon na be ?
TED: Okay . The group cheers .
CHESTER: As long as you do your part , you can take the pile , walk out the door , and not say another word .
TED: Let 's do it right now , before I change my mind .
NORMAN: Here , here .
CHESTER: Perfect , perfect , perfect , perfect ! This is great ! This is a moment in time none of us will ever forget .
NORMAN: Ready !
CHESTER: Ted , you ready ?
TED: Ready .
CHESTER: Okeydoke . Norman , begin .
NORMAN: My finger , my fucking finger ! !
ANGELA: You know , I 'm gon na call it a night and go back to my room . It 's been fun . The doors close on the screaming maniacs .
ANGELA: You okay , lady ? The bombshell looks up at her dizzily .
DIANA: Uhhh yes my husband I think . Have you seen him ?
ANGELA: Lady , I have n't seen anybody .
SIGFRIED: Where the hell have you been ?
THE END: < /pre

DU PONT: I ca n't . I 've watched you these past months I ca n't imagine being let down by you .
SPRINGER: You sure about this ?
DU PONT: Mother 's idea of sport is riding a horse that 's chasing a dog that 's chasing a fox . I do n't share he affection for horseflesh - The center case is cleared out .
CHANTING TOGETHER: Mark ! Mark ! Mark ! Mark !
DU PONT: You 've brought honor to Team Foxcatcher . He starts to walk toward him .

DU PONT: Do you believe in this team ?
MARK: Of course I -
DU PONT: - Do you believe we deserve this country 's best talent ?
MARK: I do -
DU PONT: - I pay for results not only on the mat , but in recruiting the best of the best to Foxcatcher Farms . That 's part of your job . Silence . Mark looks shamed by this .
MARK: Do you think that 's true ? Because all these years - Du Pont stands suddenly -
DU PONT: - Well . You 're the public face of Foxcatcher .
MARK: If that 's what -
DU PONT: - What do you know about Masters League wrestling tournaments ?
MARK: Uh - well - not all that much -

PHOTOGRAPHER: Good ! Now . Mark . You 're winning the gold medal ! And you are humbled !
DU PONT: I think you were below me by a couple of steps when you hugged me at the Worlds .
PHOTOGRAPHER: It 's true .
DU PONT: Maybe if you kneeled .
MARK: Kneeled now ? On the floor .
UNSURE: Really ? It wo n't look

MARK NODS: Good . Try the speech .

MARK: We all have demons .
TOTALLY SINCERE: It 's good to know you and I have come to this friendship without any of that nonsense . Financial nonsense .
MARK: When Dave 's son , Alex , was born he had some problems with his lungs . It looked like he was n't gon na live . I was sitting in the hospital waiting room , and all I could think was Maybe it 's better if he dies . Dave wo n't be distracted . We can get back to training together .
BEAT: Alex is fine now and , you know , he 's my nephew . I 'm not proud I wanted him to die , but it 's the truth . That 's just the truth .

DAVE: There 's this big match between an American and a Russian . The Russian is a monster , never lost , kills everybody with this hold called The Pretzel . So the American coach tells his wrestler , `` Listen , whatever you do do n't let this guy get you in The Pretzel or you 're dead . '' Sure enough , match starts , the Russian gets him in The Pretzel . There are smiles around the table .
SOME LAUGHS: The coach says , `` And that did the trick ? ''
LOW: 68 .
DAVE: He gives you opportunity , jump on it . Hard . Drive him down .
DU PONT: No mercy !
DAVE: Okay . Okay . You heard the Head Coach . No mercy .

MARK: Need to study up . Fix some weakness .
DAVE: You been doing this since you left ?
MARK: Pretty much .
DAVE: What 's going on with you and John ?
MARK: Nothing 's going on .
BEAT: What does that mean ?
DAVE: You seemed kind of upset in the gym .
MARK: The fuck you talking about ?

THEN: What was he saying to you ?
MARK: I do n't know what you 're talking about . Beat .

DU PONT: Next time , Mark . A good effort .
DAVE: Open up - I know you 're in there . Mark walks away from the door .
BEAT: What happened to your face ?
NO ANSWER: You got to weigh in before every match .
MARK: I 'm done .
DAVE: What does that mean ?
MARK: It 's over . I 'm done . You lost . I lost . It 's over .
DAVE: Look at me . Look at me . You have a chance to do what no wrestler 's done since 1904 . Not one . If you think I 'm gon na let you throw away a chance to win back-to-back Olympic golds you 're fucking crazy . Dave CUFFS him again , harder .
QUIET NOW: I 'm with you , Mark . You 're not in this alone .
DAVE: Shit .
OFFICIAL: 87 kilos .
DAVE: How long does he have to make weight ? The official glances up at the CLOCK .
OFFICIAL: Weigh-in period ends at 3 30pm . Dave nods . Grabs Mark .
DAVE: C'mon , fat boy , you got 90 minutes to cut 12 pounds .
DU PONT: Here you are . I 've been looking all over for you
DAVE: Wait ! Wait ! We 're here
TO MARK: Get 'em off .
OFFICIAL: 82 kilos .
DAVE: Mark . Drink . Mark just sits there . Not taking the drink .
STAN BECK: Dave . What can I do for you ?
DAVE: I 'm having some trouble finding John . He 's not in his room -
STAN BECK: - Right .
DAVE: - I wanted to check in with him . I had a kind of uncomfortable thing with John before the match this afternoon - Mark was in a really delicate place , and I had to ask John to not be in his corner . I just wanted to make sure he 's okay with everything . And that he 's happy with the result . With how things turned out .
STAN BECK: Dave . Mr. du Pont 's mother died this morning . He flew home to Philadelphia earlier today . On Dave , stunned .
GUARD: Can I help you ?
DAVE: What 's going on ?

FRED COLE: We 're so very sorry about you mother 's passing .
DU PONT: Yes . Very sad . Very sad days here . Here at the farm .
FRED COLE: Well , whatever we can do . Silence .
STAN BECK: What we wanted to discuss Mr. Du Pont spends a significant amount of money for wrestlers ' training here at Foxcatcher . Now - in addition - he 'd like to make a sizable direct donation to USA Wrestling .
THEN: This money would come with conditions .
MORE: 88 .
FRED COLE: May I ask what sort of a donation we 're discussing ?
STAN BECK: Four hundred thousand dollars . Fred chokes on his glass of water .
DU PONT: And gym bags .
STAN BECK: And gym bags . Beat . Fred glances at his fellow officials .
MARK: What 's going on ?
STAN BECK: We believe that Eagle has earned the right to be named to the official roster of Olympic coaches at Seoul . Which means he would be in Mark Schultz 's corner throughout the games . Fred looks over at Dave .
FRED COLE: We 'll all , of course , just need to get him to sign off on this .
STAN BECK: You can take care of that ?
DAVE: I can try .
MARK: Were you in the Big House yesterday ?
DAVE: For a little while .
MARK: In the afternoon ? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house .
THEN: What were you doing there ?
DAVE: I 'm a coach here . I get paid by John . I was meeting with John .
MARK: About what ?
DAVE: Mark . Get dressed .
MARK: He 's weakening me .
DAVE: What are you talking about ?
MARK: I talked to Bachman at SMU last night . He says they 're expanding the program . There 'll be room fo oth of us in the fall -
DAVE: - Mark -
MARK: - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend -
DAVE: - You need to focus on what 's happening a month from now . Not -
MARK: - SMU 's gon na make a move , they 're gon na take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning -
DAVE: - Do n't do this . Do n't do it . Stay clear about what we 're working for .
MARK: - I ca n't do this anymore . I ca n't do it -
DAVE: - It 's not the time , Mark -
MARK: - John 's killing me here -
DAVE: - He 's not killing you -
MARK: - If we at least let Bachman know y the end of the week we 'll have a place to go to after -
DAVE: - Stop . Stop it !
MARK: You 're not thinking of staying here ?
DAVE: I do n't know , Mark . The schools are great , the kids are happy . They have eight hundred acres to run around in
MARK: My own life .
DAVE: That 's right .
MARK: And you 'll be here .
DAVE: I 'll be here . Whenever you need me .
MARK: What 's on your forehead ?
DAVE: What ?
MARK: It says kids .
DAVE: To remind me to pick up the kids from school .
MARK: What does that mean ? When are you gon na you see your own forehead ?
DAVE: I do n't have to . You just told me . On Mark , PRELAP
CORPORAL: Here we go , sir . Five tons of fun .
DU PONT: Where 's the grenade launcher ?
CORPORAL: I 'm sorry ?
DU PONT: The 40mm grenade launcher that 's supposed to be mounted up here .
CORPORAL: I do n't know , sir . I do n't I do n't see anything in the order -
DU PONT: - It goes right here . Right here .
CORPORAL: Yes , it does . It does mount right there on the top .
DU PONT: So where is it ?
DAVE: My name 's Dave Schultz . I 'm Coach and head of recruiting here at Foxcatcher , under Head Coach John `` Eagle '' du Pont -
UNCOMFORTABLE: We consider John
QUIETLY: one of us .
MORE: 95 .
SO QUIETLY: One of us .
DAVE: I 'll commit to remaining at Foxcatcher so long as John wants me here , but only if my brother is taken care of .
STAN BECK: Taken care of how ?
DAVE: So long as I 'm here , Mark will continue to be paid .
STAN BECK: Paid what ?
DAVE: His full salary .
STAN BECK: You want him paid even if he leaves ? What if he quits ?
DAVE: Whether or not he chooses to stay . That 's right .
STAN BECK: You 're making quite an assumption about the value of your presence here .
DAVE: You 're welcome to test the theory .
STAN BECK: What does that mean ?
DAVE: We can see how many wrestlers stay if I decide to go .
BEAT: I hope it does n't come to that .
STAN BECK: You 're that determined to leave ? Mark does n't respond .
DAVE: He 'd like the option .
STAN BECK: First of all , Mark has always been free to train in whatever -
DAVE: - That 's not exactly how it 's -
STAN BECK: - Just a minute - you 've had you say .
DAVE: Sorry .
STAN BECK: - To train in whatever way is most effective for him . Eagle offers his advice and counsel . If Mark chooses to ignore it , that 's his loss .
THEN: Mr. du Pont would be prepared to accept your financial terms , but only if we get an answer to what we proposed weeks ago .
DAVE: What 's that ?
STAN BECK: That John du Pont , Head Coach of Team Foxcatcher , be seated in Mark 's corner throughout the Olympic Games . Mark looks at Dave . Quiet , betrayed
MARK: You 've talked about this ?
DAVE: I was waiting for the right moment to bring it up with you . You have n't exactly been in a receptive frame of mind .
STAN BECK: All right , then . I guess we 're done . Silence as they all just sit there .
DAVE: This is your moment to prove yourself - your moment to step out alone , away from everyone , into the spotlight . This has nothing to do with me , nothing to do with John -
ANNOUNCER: From the United States of America , at 82 kilos Mark Schultz .
REFEREE: Wrestle !
GUARD: Name ? On Mark , looking at him .
DU PONT: From the under hook , pivot sideways while pulling down on his arm . Kneel between his legs and take him to the mat .
DAVE: He 's made himself an - an expert in the art and sport of wrestling Dave stumbles on the words -
QUIETLY: One of us .
DU PONT: Our challenge as coaches as leaders . I have coached and psychologically prepare our Mark Schultz to capture Olympic Gold . I wear many hats . I am leader . Mentor . Father figure . Brother .
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR: We 've bought several time slots next week on local station WPHI -
DU PONT: Good .
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR: - Several late night slots , of course , but there was also an open afternoon half-hour , directly afte `` The Edge of Night . '' That should be a good one -
DU PONT: Excellent .
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR: - I 'll let you know what the viewership numbers are as soon as I have them .
DU PONT: Northern Cardinal . Look at that .
DAVE: Hey , Coach .
DU PONT: You got a problem with me ?
DAVE: JOHN -
NANCY: Dave ! . David !
TINA: The N.T.S.B . guys are here .
CRAWFORD: Yep .

CRAWFORD: I could use a hug .
JENNIFER: Have you been drinking ?
CRAWFORD: I 've been watching you sleep . At night .
JENNIFER: That 's creepy .
CRAWFORD: Sometimes when I 'm at work , I 'll start thinking about you and I 'll just get - just - overwhelmed .
JENNIFER: Tommy -
CRAWFORD: It 's a dense , crushing - geophysical force . Like I 'm pinned . At the core - where things change . You ever get that way about me , Jen ?
JENNIFER: What are you talking about ?
CRAWFORD: I 'm trying to describe my feelings .
JENNIFER: Those do n't sound like feelings .
CRAWFORD: No ? What 's the sound of one feelingin a forest ?
JENNIFER: You think you 're so much smarte than I am . That must make you feel very powerful .
CRAWFORD: Helpless , actually . Silence .
JENNIFER: Okay . Maybe it 's time to really talk .
CRAWFORD: No .
JENNIFER: No ?
CRAWFORD: I know . Everything .
JENNIFER: I 'm so sorry .
CRAWFORD: Do n't be . Knowledge is pain . I 'm used to that .
GIFFORD: Tom ? Jen ? Everything okay in there ?
CRAWFORD: Everybody just LEAVE US ALONE !
SWAT COMMANDER: You the Negotiator ?
NUNALLY: Yeah . What do we know ?
CRAWFORD: Yes ?
NUNALLY: Mr. Crawford ?
CRAWFORD: Who is this ?
NUNALLY: My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally . I 'm a hostage negotiator for the Los - Crawford hangs up . Thoughtful .
CRAWFORD: Get rid of the vampires .
NUNALLY: If you want .
CRAWFORD: Not vampires .
NUNALLY: What ?
CRAWFORD: Not vampires . Ghouls . Sorry .
NUNALLY: Mr. Crawford , what do you say you give me the gun - so I can pay more attention to what you 're saying ? Crawford sighs .
CRAWFORD: Is that your best shot ? So to speak .
NUNALLY: I just think - maybe it would -
CRAWFORD: Tell you what I will if you will . Nunally frowns , wary .
NUNALLY: Mr. Crawford , your neighbor mentioned that your wife -
CRAWFORD: It 's Tom .
NUNALLY: I 'm sorry ?
CRAWFORD: You can call me Tom .
NUNALLY: Tom . Your wife . Is she here ?
CRAWFORD: Yes .
NUNALLY: Is she all right ?
CRAWFORD: I do n't think she is . I shot her , Rob .
NUNALLY: You shot your wife .
CRAWFORD: It was like I just suddenly - snapped . We were arguing - and I got the gun .
NUNALLY: - okay - I hear you -
CRAWFORD: And I shot her in the head . I know it was wrong . Are you listening to me ?
NUNALLY: Oh Jesus Christ .
CRAWFORD: You know , I think I read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery . It 's on the inne surface of the upper thigh . If you put your fingers - you know , right up inside her dress -
PARAMEDIC: Wait a second - she 's not dead !
SWAT COMMANDER: You all right ? Nunally `` wakes '' - nods . Absently

NORMAN: `` Bob '' Wooton ? !
WILLY: It 's what the man told me to call him .
GLADYS: You 're gon na need to pick out a style , Willy .

WILLY: Yes sir .
LOBRUTO: Sit . Eighty-four-percent conviction rate . That 's remarkable .
WILLY: Thank you .
LOBRUTO: With a case load thirty percent highe than any other first-year DDA . Of course - you also swapped more cases than the rest of them put together .
WILLY: I offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else 's possible convictions . They could n't handle their workloads , and I prefe not to lose .
LOBRUTO: You 're going to need a middle initial .
WILLY: Sir ?
LOBRUTO: You 're going to Wooton Sims .
WILLY: In two weeks .
LOBRUTO: You 'll be able to afford a bette suit . But those guys all play squash and have middle names . They go in fo the mother 's maiden name a lot .
WILLY: My mother did n't have a maiden name . Lobruto nods , unruffled by Willy 's hard calm .
LOBRUTO: So you 're a bastard ; sometimes I can e a son-of-a-bitch . Maybe you belong here .
WILLY: I did n't work this hard to stay where I belong .
LOBRUTO: You 're a street-fighter , Willy . You should be in court . We can move you up to better cases .
WILLY: I appreciate the offer .
LOBRUTO: I did n't think so . Well - you got your litigation experience . Your chops . And you juicy private sector job . Anything else the City of Los Angeles can do for you ?

WILLY: Three o'clock is in fifteen minutes .
NORMAN: Thank you . What 's the temperature ?
WILLY: I ca n't do it .
NORMAN: You do still actually work here , Willy , right ? I mean , you 're still going to be cashing your paycheck fo another two weeks and everything ?
WILLY: Just get somebody else for this one .
NORMAN: Everybody 's booked up . Look it 's not going to trial . There 's a weapon with prints , and a confession . Take the arraignment and wait for the plea .
WILLY: A real confession ?
NORMAN: Spontaneous and signed . Come on , Willy .
WILLY: Okay . Here 's the problem .
NORMAN: You know - I really wish I was going to see this .
JUDGE FELDMAN: Mr. Slocum . Nice to see a man who dresses for court .
WILLY: Sorry , your honor . Long story .
JUDGE FELDMAN: Grapevine has it the punch-line is Wooton Sims .
WILLY: Yes , ma'am .
JUDGE FELDMAN: Good for you , double-oh-seven . Let 's see what public service is offering you by way of a send-off
BAILIFF: The State of California Versus Thomas Crawford .
JUDGE: Mr. Crawford , you 've been charged with section 664 slash 187 of the California Penal Code Attempted Murder , with additional allegations of Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal Code section 245 dash A2 , with Great Bodily Injury , P.C . Section 12022.07 . Do you waive further reading of the complaint and complete statement of ights ?
JUDGE FELDMAN: And do you wish to enter a plea at this time ?
CRAWFORD: Not guilty . But I also want to waive my right to counsel , and represent myself . Willy looks up from the file - startled .
JUDGE FELDMAN: Do you have a problem with you appointed counsel , Mr. Crawford ?
CRAWFORD: No . I just want to do it myself . I elieve it 's within my rights .
JUDGE FELDMAN: Do the People have an objection or a comment for the record , Mr. Slocum ?
WILLY: I 'm sorry , your honor we 've got the weapon and a signed confession . I eally think Mr. Crawford needs a competent attorney to - frankly - negotiate a plea .
CRAWFORD: Excuse me ? Your honor ? I 'm willing to waive my right to a preliminary hearing and go directly to a jury trial . Does that help ?
JUDGE: You do n't need to look out for Mr. Slocum , Mr. Crawford . The District Attorney 's office can shift anothe prosecutor to the case -
CRAWFORD: No , I like Mr. Slocum . Beat .
JUDGE FELDMAN: Mr. Slocum ? He likes you .
WILLY: Terrific .
JUDGE FELDMAN: Mr. Crawford seems to understand his ights and responsibilities .
WILLY: All due respect , your honor , I 'm worried this may turn into some sort of a - circus -
JUDGE FELDMAN: I appreciate your concern for the dignity of my courtroom , Mr. Slocum - considering you 're making the argument dressed as a game-show host . Unfortunately , the man is a tax-paying citizen , entitled by our Constitution to try and manipulate the legal system , like everybody else .
CRAWFORD: I understand . Thank you .
JUDGE FELDMAN: Are the People ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing ?
WILLY: Sure . Why not .
NUNALLY: You 're supposed to be good .
WILLY: Is that what I 'm supposed to be ?
NUNALLY: I asked around . You 're supposed to be top-notch - but to me it looks like you 've got one foot out the door , and you 're wiping the rest of us off the ottom of the other one .
WILLY: I 'm sorry todisappoint you .
NUNALLY: I took Crawford 's confession .
WILLY: And now you want mine ?
NUNALLY: I 'm here to warn you . Take this seriously , because it 's serious . This guy is stone cold - and his wife - is lying in a hospital bed - with brain damage He struggles to keep himself under control .
WILLY: Are you all right ?
NUNALLY: Are you gon na be on this , or what ?
WILLY: Yeah . I 'm on it . You got a confession . You took the gun out of his hand . It 's done .
NUNALLY: I 'm just - telling you . Is that okay ? Or are you too friggin ' busy ? !
WILLY: No . It 's okay .
NUNALLY: Forget it . It 's a lock . We 're good . Put him down . Bury him .
NIKKI: Are you a shark ?
WILLY: Sorry ?
NIKKI: You 've been circling the lobby fo half-an-hour now , like if you stopped you 'd die .
WILLY: If I stopped , I 'd be standing around with no one to talk to . At which point , death would be a relief .
NIKKI: Why do n't you talk to Bob ?
WILLY: `` Bob '' is talking to the Governor . Do I know you ? She puts a hand out , gently amused .
NIKKI: Nikki Gardner . Senior Associate , Wooton Sims .
WILLY: Oh - hey , hi . It was your office that called , with the invitation .
NIKKI: On Bob 's orders .
WILLY: Listen , I don'tactually know `` Bob . '' I mean , I 've only met the man once . Nikki nods , considering this . And him .
NIKKI: Interesting .
WILLY: Truth is , I have n't really had that much expos-
NIKKI: Neither do I .
WILLY: Kind of like a mentor .
NIKKI: Kind of like a probation officer .
WILLY: Okay .
NIKKI: Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty and a hundred-and-ten-percent performance . But you get to work on legendary litigation . National , sometimes global , in scope . It 's high- stakes . And cut-throat - even within the team . We burn out associates at an astonishing rate .
WILLY: You 're trying to scare me .
NIKKI: Yes .
WILLY: You 're going to have to try harder . She stops walking . Studying Willy .
NIKKI: Can I ask you something personal ?
WILLY: Sure .
NIKKI: Who are you ?
WILLY: It was a good bust , so Calvin came to me for a deal . I told him if he could arrange an interview for me with Mr. Wooton , I would throw the case . I laid out his arguments and evidence for him - and I showed him how I would lose . Calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date . Then he did what I had suggested in court - and I wiped the floor with him . Your client got the maximum . Next day , I met with Mr. Wooton . Bob . Beat .
NIKKI: Wow . You know what 's brilliant about that ?
WILLY: Yes .
NIKKI: You did n't actually do anything all that wrong .
WILLY: Well - I was n't entirely honest with Calvin . His cell-phone rings . He ignores it .
NIKKI: You gon na get that ?
WILLY: Everyone I need to talk to is here .
NIKKI: We need to talk about your transition timetable .
WILLY: All right .
NIKKI: Bob believes in trial-by-fire . He wants you up-to-speed two weeks from Tuesday , because we 're getting on a plane to Chicago for depositions in a class-action against our biggest client , Armstead Pharmaceutical .
WILLY: No problem .
NIKKI: That 's catch-up on three years ' work - and you have n't closed out your old job yet .
WILLY: I 'm good at trials . Even by fire . Beat .
NIKKI: You know , a little bit of fear can be a very healthy thing to have .
WILLY: I 'm looking forward to when I can afford the luxury of having some .
NIKKI: I 'll have them put the Armstead materials in your new office .
WILLY: Thanks . Boss .
MARCHAND: Marchand .
WILLY: It 's Willy Slocum . What 's up ?
MARCHAND: Your gun in that Palisades shooting is no good .
WILLY: How can the gun be `` no good '' ?
MARCHAND: It 's a perfectly good weapon . A Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter . It 's just no good as evidence . It 's neve een fired .
WILLY: It 's the gun from the scene ?
MARCHAND: Yep . Bought by Mr. Thomas Crawford and registered to his wife , about a month ago . Apparently a gift .
WILLY: And between the shooting and arrest , this guy was locked inside his house .
MARCHAND: Is that a question ?
WILLY: No , I mean , just what 's the point ? Playing games with the gun . He 's alone in the house with the victim , and he confessed - it 's not like the gun 's gon na get him off the hook .
MARCHAND: Do you have a question I can answer ?
WILLY: Look , our weapon is in that house somewhere . Get a team out to search it tomorrow morning .
MARCHAND: Ya think ?
WILLY: Thank you .
MESSENGER: Where do you want it ?
WILLY: The idea here is we 're trying to take oxes out - not bring more in .
MESSENGER: Is that the idea ?
WILLY: Whoa - wait a second , this is a screw- up . I already have these documents . I sent this box to the Defendant , at County .
MESSENGER: I picked up at County . Slip says ing 'em here .
MARCHAND: Marchand .
WILLY: Where are we on this gun ?
MARCHAND: We ca n't find it , Willy .
WILLY: I 'm in trial on Monday .
MARCHAND: I know . I do n't know what to tell you . I 'm there now .
WILLY: You said you 'd get a team out a week ago -
MARCHAND: I 'm here now . My team has been here twice already . Do you really need it ?
WILLY: Do I need it ? ! The weapon ? !
MARCHAND: He went pro se , right ?
WILLY: Yeah . Just when you think they 're not eally stupid , they defend themselves .
MARCHAND: You 've got a confession and an airtight bunch of circumstantial . We 've gone over this place top-to- ottom three times now , Willy . Willy takes a breath . Thinks it through .
WILLY: Yeah , okay . Do n't worry about it . Sorry - got a lot going on .
MARCHAND: Must be rough , figuring out what you 're gon na do with all that money .
WILLY: Hey , I had to sit through an opera last week .
MARCHAND: Oh gee - lem me see if I can express how much sympathy I have Marchand snaps his phone shut .
CRAWFORD: How 's my wife ?
WILLY: I do n't know .
CRAWFORD: I heard somewhere , I think it was on N.P.R. , that you 're supposed to talk to people in a coma . Play thei favorite music . Supposedly it reaches them . Willy , now ready , lets Crawford study him .
WILLY: Not yet .
CRAWFORD: Too busy getting up to speed on Armstead Pharmaceutical ? Beat .
WILLY: I beg your pardon ?
CRAWFORD: I 'm not judging you . I think anyone - coming fromwhat you came from - then paying your way through East-Okie Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by writing papers for Princeton kids on the internet - my God , it must have eaten your liver ! Sixty-thousand dollars in debt , eighty-four percent conviction rate you deserve this . Willy tries to stay in control .
WILLY: What the hell have you been doing .
CRAWFORD: I 'm permitted the use of a private investigator .
WILLY: Not to investigate me !
CRAWFORD: Why not ? You 're investigating me .
WILLY: You shot your wife .
CRAWFORD: Allegedly . That 's how it works , ight ? If I ca n't introduce something in court as evidence - it does n't exist . Legally .
WILLY: Look - I do n't want to play games with you .
CRAWFORD: I 'm afraid you have to .
WILLY: Is this some form of - communication ?
CRAWFORD: You sent me a box of papers .
WILLY: It 's called Discovery . The State has a legal obliga-
CRAWFORD: There 's nothing in it , Willy . You have n't 'discovered ' anything . Have you found the gun ? Beat .
WILLY: Not yet .
CRAWFORD: No . Does it bother you that I call you Willy ?
WILLY: No . Crawford nods . Pleased . Leans forward .
CRAWFORD: I 'd like you to consider becoming my lawyer . I 'll pay you . A lot of money .
WILLY: I 'm - prosecuting you .
CRAWFORD: Yeah , but I 'm offering you a chance to get on the right side of this whole mess while you still can .
WILLY: Are you out of your mind ?
CRAWFORD: I think - on advice of counsel - I 'll decline to answer that one .
WILLY: I do n't need the gun to convict you , y the way .
CRAWFORD: She was cheating , you know .
WILLY: It does n't matter what she didTom . What you did is a crime .
CRAWFORD: Perhaps . But - maybe my so-called peers will look at me and see themselves . Betrayed . Frustrated . Humiliated . And you and I both know , Willy , that people have an infinite capacity for believing in their own innocence .
WILLY: Great . Take the stand . Tell you story . I 'd appreciate it .
CRAWFORD: Not to mention the fact you have no actual evidence connecting me to the crime . Willy smiles , gets up .
WILLY: Except your confession . Crawford watches him go to the door .
CRAWFORD: My grandfather was an egg farmer . Willy stops , annoyed .
WILLY: Is this gon na be about how you had a ough childhood ?
CRAWFORD: I used to candle eggs at his farm . You know what that is ? You hold an egg up to a light , and look fo imperfections . The first time I did it , he told me to put the ones that were cracked o flawed in a bucket - for the bakery . He came back an hour later and there were three hundred eggs in the bakery ucket . He asked me what the hell I was doing . I found a flaw in every single one . Thin places in the shell , minuscule cracks . Look closely enough and you 'll find everything has a weak spotwhere it can break .
WILLY: Looking for mine ?
CRAWFORD: No , I 've found yours .
WILLY: Illuminate me . Crawford considers how to put it .
CRAWFORD: You 're a winner , Willy .
WILLY: Huh . Well . Joke 's on me then , I guess .
CRAWFORD: Yes . It is .
WILLY: I 'll see you in court , Mr. Crawford .
NIKKI: Make sure you sign the one with the devil in blood . It 's not binding otherwise . He looks up , smiles .
WILLY: Just want to be ready for Chicago . I 'm all closed-out , downtown . Last trial starts Monday . Beat . Not pleased
NIKKI: You 've got a trial Monday ?
WILLY: Yeah attempted murder .
NIKKI: That gives you three days . You told me - and I told Bob - that you would e ready to hit the ground r-
WILLY: The man confessed . And he 's pro se .
NIKKI: Willy , some but acting as his own lawyer - he could drag it out fo months !
WILLY: You want to hear his witness list ?
NIKKI: No witnesses ?
WILLY: It 's kind of clever this guy is trying to provoke the system into declaring him insane . I think he thinks we 'll call in the doctors and he can fake 'em out by refusing the defense . He 's acting out this really - organized plan to appear crazy . Beat . Nikki considers Willy .
NIKKI: You 're gon na miss being in court , are n't you ?
WILLY: I 'm almost halfway through these . And I think I 've already found about six disqualifiers in Delaware , Ohio , and Florida . I have to check case law in each state , but it looks good . I 'll get the rest done over the long weekend .
NIKKI: You do n't go home for Thanksgiving ? Slight beat .
WILLY: No .
NIKKI: If you want - you 're welcome at mine . My family 's .
WILLY: Really ?
NIKKI: I think it would be interesting . Beat .
WILLY: Yeah . Okay , thank you .
NIKKI: Cool .
UNIFORM COP: We established a perimeter around the house and then waited for SWAT and the Negotiator . It was strictly by the ook .
WILLY: So the house was completely surrounded within how long of the first shots ?
UNIFORM COP: Maybe ten minutes .
WILLY: And when you arrived at the sc-
CRAWFORD: Sorry .
WILLY: When you arrived on the scene , was there a crowd ?
UNIFORM COP: Oh yeah . Neighbors , came out to look soon as it started .
WILLY: And from what you could ascertain , no one went into or came out of the house until SWAT and the negotiator arrived ?
UNIFORM COP: Definitely not .
WILLY: Thank you . No further questions .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Crawford ? Crawford looks up from his drawing .
CRAWFORD: What ?
JUDGE ROBINSON: Your witness , Mr. Crawford . Crawford takes in the Uniform Cop .
CRAWFORD: No questions for this witness .
DR. KANG: - through the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe , coming to rest against the back of the skull .
WILLY: So this bullet inflicted serious injury ?
DR. KANG: It inflicted serious and irreparable injury .
WILLY: Dr. Kang , is it safe to say that someone inflicting this kind of wound intended to kill ? Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Crawford , you might want to object . The witness ca n't know you state of mind .
CRAWFORD: No thank you , your honor .
KANG: I would say so , yes .
WILLY: Thank you , Dr. Kang . Crawford tears off the page , starts another .
NUNALLY: He confessed to shooting his wife .
WILLY: He confessed . Did Mr. Crawford appear confused or in any way intoxicated , impaired ?
NUNALLY: No . Not at all . He knew what was going on .
WILLY: What did Mr. Crawford say ?
NUNALLY: He said , `` I got the gun and I shot my wife . God help me , I shot her in the head . I know it was wrong . ''
CRAWFORD: Objection . Everyone turns , surprised .
JUDGE ROBINSON: I 'm sorry - Mr. Crawford , did you say something ?
CRAWFORD: Yes . I want to object .
JUDGE ROBINSON: On what grounds ?
CRAWFORD: I do n't know .
WILLY: Your honor -
CRAWFORD: I do n't know what you 'd call it . They - it was n't the first time , either , ut - I do n't know the legal term .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Why do n't you just explain it in layman 's terms .
CRAWFORD: Fucking the victim . Uproar in the court .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Crawford -
CRAWFORD: You said layman 's terms -
WILLY: Your honor -
CRAWFORD: I 'm sorry - what would you call it - legally - when the officer who arrested you has been having sexual intercourse with your wife ?
WILLY: Oh - shit .
CRAWFORD: I think it 's objectionable - maybe I 'm wrong .
WILLY: Your honor
JUDGE ROBINSON: Detective Nunally ?
CRAWFORD: Rob ?
WILLY: Your honor , the People request a -
CRAWFORD: My mistake . Sorry .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Crawford , I warned you about epresenting yourself .
CRAWFORD: What about the fact that it 's true ? I mean , is n't that the point here to get to the truth ?
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Slocum - is it true ?
WILLY: I do n't know . I only heard about it five minutes ago .
CRAWFORD: Put him back on the witness stand if you do n't believe me .
WILLY: We ca n't put him back on now ! Not after what the jury just saw . You honor , I told you this would turn into a circus . First he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation -
CRAWFORD: My Dick has evidence .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Excuse me ?
CRAWFORD: My investigator . I call him Dick . I guess I should call him as a rebuttal
WILLY: Okay - um I 'll stipulate that my witness was less than forthcoming and that can more or less cancel out the fact that the defendant withheld a crucial -
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Slocum - your witness was intimate with the victim , and he assaulted the defendant during the arrest .
CRAWFORD: Actually , while obtaining my so-called `` confession . ''
WILLY: No way . Your honor -
JUDGE ROBINSON: He 's got a point . They were alone in the house . The confession is no good .
WILLY: Oh - come on !
CRAWFORD: Is this a legal argument ? `` Oh come on '' ?
WILLY: You want to get into it ? !
JUDGE ROBINSON: In police custody . Arguably , in fea for his life . I 'm sorry , Mr. Slocum - it 's all 'fruit of the tainted tree . ' We have to exclude all versions of the confession and any evidence collected y Lieutenant Nunally or by othe police officers on the night he was present .
WILLY: This is insane !
CRAWFORD: It 's Biblical , is n't it ? The fruit and the tree and -
WILLY: He set this up ! Do n't you see what he 's doing ? !
JUDGE ROBINSON: Yes , I do . And I do n't like it . But it 's done , so we have to deal with it .
CRAWFORD: Do you think I could go home today , your honor ? With Thanksgiving around the corner -
JUDGE ROBINSON: Do n't push it , Mr. Crawford . What we 're going to do is give Mr. Slocum a few days to regroup and come up with new evidence . If he does n't - then you can go home . That 's going to put us into the long weekend . We econvene Monday morning .
WILLY: Willy Slocum .
NIKKI: Well - you 've got ta admire the cleverness of it .
WILLY: Do I ?
NIKKI: Okay then listen - I checked with Bo on how he wants you to handle this .
WILLY: No .
NIKKI: Well , he pretty much has to if he 's gon na save any face . So here 's the strategy you let him .
WILLY: I let him ?
NIKKI: Willy today , you got killed . The issue now is saving your new life .
WILLY: I guessthat would be the smart way of looking at it .
NIKKI: You want to come out and get drunk ?
WILLY: No . Thank you . I 've got some stuff to take care of .
NIKKI: All right . Do n't beat yourself up .
WILLY: I wo n't .
LOBRUTO: You do n't look into who the victim was sleeping with ?
WILLY: He - threw me off . Look , Crawford knew he 'd be the prime suspect , so he gave us everything - ut he made it all radioactive . The night this went down , it was over .
LOBRUTO: But you still walked it into court , Willy . We might not have a casebut it did n't have to be a public humiliation for this office and the police department . Silence .
WILLY: Are you taking me off ?
LOBRUTO: You 're leaving anyway .
WILLY: I 'm starting to get a sense of this guy .
LOBRUTO: That 's not new evidence .
WILLY: I can take him now he thinks he 's smarter than I am .
LOBRUTO: It 's not about you , Willy .
WILLY: Yeah , it is . He made it that way . He likes me .
LOBRUTO: What is that - some kind of Oklahoma insult ?
WILLY: Let me do this . I wo n't make you look ad . Beat .
LOBRUTO: No . You wo n't . That 's what I need to make sure you understand . I remove you now I 'm covered , I took some action . If you go on with this , when you lose - lame has to come down . And it 'll come down on you . I 'll have to investigate you for improprieties , incompetence - anything I can . In public . I 'll hang you out to dry . For the good of this office . Silence .
WILLY: If I lose .
LOBRUTO: What ?
WILLY: You said `` when . ''
LOBRUTO: All right . It 's yours . Willy nods . Stubborn . Scared .
WILLY: You 're not easy to find . I had to call Internal Affairs .
NUNALLY: Yeah - they put me on a desk - 'til this getssorted out .
WILLY: What the hell were you thinking . You 're on the job and you get called to your girlfriend 's house -
NUNALLY: I did n't know it was her house . I 'd never been there .
WILLY: It was her name !
NUNALLY: I did n't know her name !
WILLY: Did you get the feeling she had rules ecause she had done it before ? With other guys ?
NUNALLY: No . I do n't know . Maybe . No . It was all just thiscrazy thing . For both of us . It was eal . You know ? We did n't expect that , when we started . We did n't know where it was going . I had cheated so many times , I was numb - but she was new . And she made me feel like there was - some chance . To change . We were scared . It was like we were afraid to go forward , but we could n't go back . You always think you have time . To work it out . Or make things right . What was I supposed to do ? !
WILLY: You were supposed to tell me !
NUNALLY: I 'm married ! I have kids !
WILLY: You thought nobody knew - so maybe you could just walk away clean .
NUNALLY: No ! I did n't think HE knew ! OKAY ? ! Even - after . I thought it was just - massively fouled-upbad luck . Like - God - telling me - something . I 'm there . My mind is going crazy . I know the confession wo n't hold if anyone finds out . I thought the guy was a whack !
WILLY: Yeah ? Well , he 's not .
NUNALLY: Itried to warn you . Willy stops . Looks back .
WILLY: You warned me he was smart . You did n't warn me you were stupid .
NUNALLY: How do we get the confession back in ?
WILLY: We do n't .
NUNALLY: What are you gon na do ? Willy shakes his head . Walks out .
WILLY: Shake the boxes .
DEPUTY: Huh ?
WILLY: The cereal boxes - shake 'em . And there 's a chicken in the freezer . Thaw it out , check inside .
MARCHAND: And the tool shed , and the roof , and the H.V.A.C . ducts .
WILLY: What about the door frames ? The floors ?
MARCHAND: What did he do rip open a door frame , hide the gun inside and re-plaster the wall before SWAT showed up ?
WILLY: What about the neighbors ' property ? He could have thrown it over the hedges .
MARCHAND: We checked . He might have passed it off to somebody , Willy . Had an accomplice , waiting , out the back . Willy shakes his head , grim . Pacing .
WILLY: This is n't an accomplice sort of guy .
MARCHAND: I 'm sure . Willy grimaces . Fuming , relentless
WILLY: It 's a physical object . It ca n't just vanish . We 're missing something - some step in the story .
MARCHAND: But then he carries her back there . Why ?
WILLY: Because he 's gon na need time . To confess . When she 's alone with the cop .
MARCHAND: Neighbor comes to the door . Willy nods , comes out - crosses to the foyer
WILLY: Crawford shouts , `` Leave us alone '' and fires three more rounds boom-boom- oom .
MARCHAND: So everybody knows he 's dangerous - and she might still be alive .
WILLY: So they 'll call the Negotiator . Now he 's got about ten minutes .
MARCHAND: I 'm sorry , Willy .
WILLY: Or a pot to boil , or a Better Break Or a string of pearls , or a pair of pants Or a wig with curls Or Another Chance . He stops reading a moment . Watching her
RESIDENT: Who told you that ?
WILLY: The man who shot her .
RESIDENT: Are you a member of the family ?
WILLY: Sorry . I 'm with the District Attorney 's office . We do n't have any other witnesses .
RESIDENT: This woman had a bullet plow through her brain .
WILLY: I know . But you hear about people waking up from comas . After everybody said pull the plug - they wake up . You hear stuff like that all the time .
RESIDENT: You hear about Elvis and Aliens , too . All the time .
WILLY: It 's not impossible , though . Is it ? I mean - why else are you keeping he like this ? Beat . The Resident sighs .
RESIDENT: No . It 's not impossible . But even if she did , she might not remember how to talk - let alone anything about how she was shot .
WILLY: When I was here alone before , she moved a little .
RESIDENT: Are you just going to keep asking the same question in different ways until you hear the answer you want ? Beat .
WILLY: That 's how it works with the law .
RESIDENT: I knew I should have gone to law school .
WILLY: So this is all exactly how he left it .
TINA: Yes .
WILLY: And he was - distraught .
TINA: He was drinking . The past few weeks .
WILLY: But he was working on this .
TINA: Do you want coffee . He said I should ask . Willy turns , a little rattled . Beat .
WILLY: Tell him I said no thank you .
ASSISTANT MANAGER: A month .
WILLY: Can I get a copy of October 9th ?
ASSISTANT MANAGER: I 'll have it for you Friday .
WILLY: I 'm kind of under the gun here .
ASSISTANT MANAGER: We 're short-staffed tonight and tomorrow . Beat . Seeing Willy 's confusion
WILLY: Right . Okay .
GARDNER: White or dark , Willy ?
WILLY: Anything is fine , your honor .
GARDNER: I 'm off-duty , you can call me Lew .
WILLY: So - is everyone in this family involved in the law ?
SANDRA: Well , Nikki 's not .
NIKKI: Ha ha . Burton 's a counsel for Sierra Club , and Sandra 's ACLU - so they use the holidays as an opportunity to give me a hard time , because I can buy and sell them .
SANDRA: We 're not actually for sale , Nick . Nikki gives Willy a did-I-tell-you ? look .
GARDNER: Nicole decided early-on that black sheep was the most effective role in which to distinguish herself from he siblings .
NIKKI: You know of any other family in America where the corporate lawye who 's going to make partner by thirty- five is the `` black sheep '' ?
GARDNER: Well - you may be lost beyond ecovery , but maybe we can still convince Willy that defending giant corporations against injured citizens is not the best use of his skills .
WILLY: I do n't think so , sir . It 's where the money is .
GARDNER: I believe that phrase refers to banks . And it was coined by a thief .
WILLY: Times have changed .
NIKKI: You do n't have to do this .
WILLY: I do n't mind ; I get this kind of thing now and then . Almost always from people with money .
GARDNER: Appearances can be deceiving , Willy . I grew up with eight brothers and sisters on a farm up in Fresno , and I promise you I saw my share of hard times . Willy considers his options .
WILLY: My mom OD 'd fairly frequently , so they put me in a Group Home . My younge sister is dead and my older brother is doing twenty-five-to-life .
GARDNER: You win .
WILLY: I usually do .
GARDNER: Yes . I see that .
BURTON: I do n't know if you will against the wife-shooter , though . The click of silverware .
SANDRA: Whoops .
NIKKI: Nice , Burton .
WILLY: It 's not over 'til it 's over .
BURTON: That looked pretty over .
NIKKI: Anyway , Willy 's been taken off the case .
GARDNER: It might not seem like it now , but that 's a blessing in disguise , Willy .
WILLY: I was n't . Nikki looks at Willy .
NIKKI: What ?
WILLY: Taken off .
NIKKI: Thatdoes n't make any sense . Lobruto has to do some kind of damage control -
WILLY: I asked him not to . Silence . Nikki is staring at him . Angry .
NIKKI: You are really stupid , did you know that ?
WILLY: I 'm - getting new evidence -
NIKKI: Where ? The Evidence Store ? ! Oh , that 's right - they open early the day after Thanksgiving . You 're gon na be fine !
WILLY: Did it ever occur to you I might be good enough to still win ? !
NIKKI: Who cares ? ! Win what ?
WILLY: The man shot his -
NIKKI: You wanted corporate , right ? ! You wanted to play in the big leagues ? !
WILLY: Yeah , I 'm just -
NIKKI: You go to all that trouble getting yourself in - and then you just pay no attention to wh-
WILLY: Look - I 'm sorry - can we not talk about this here ? !
NIKKI: Fine .
WILLY: Thank you .
NIKKI: I need to talk with you .
WILLY: Look , I 'm sorry I did n't tell you -
NIKKI: Did you hear me , when I said Bo wanted you gone as soon as this thing oke ? ! Did you hear me say I went out on a limb to convince him -
WILLY: Would n't it be better than damage control if I actually turn it around ?
NIKKI: And what if you do n't ?
WILLY: What am I supposed to do ?
NIKKI: We told the man you 're getting on a plane to Chicago , Tuesday . Painful silence .
WILLY: Yeah . Okay .
NIKKI: All right . Call if you want .
WILLY: I 've got some work to do . I need to call a cab .
GARDNER: You know what nobody understands about certain kinds of underpaid public service work ? Now and then you get to put a fucking stake in a bad guy 's heart . We 're not supposed to talk about that when we visit a third-grade class on Career Day , and it does n't get you very far into the country-clu locker room - but it 's hard to beat when you actually get to do it .
WILLY: Shit ! - by Nunally , on the other side of the glass .
NUNALLY: We need to talk .
WILLY: Thank you , Professor Einstein . It would also be good to find a couple of
NUNALLY: No - Willy we need to find the gun .
WILLY: I 've had three different teams here -
NUNALLY: He did n't leave between the shooting and when we took him out in cuffs . The gun is here . So we have to find it .
WILLY: Well - we ca n't ! You want to move on ?
NUNALLY: There 's a guy in the Evidence Room , owes me a favor . Well - it 's not so much a favor as I know stuff about him . He can trade this for the bullet from Jennifer , give us a ballistic match . Beat .
WILLY: It 's a crime .
NUNALLY: So who 's gon na get away with a crime - this asshole , or us ? Willy sighs . Tosses the gun back .
WILLY: Go home .
NUNALLY: What else have you got ? !
WILLY: I 'll find a way .
NUNALLY: No you wo n't .
MARCHAND: Willy . There 's nothing here .
WILLY: Guns do n't just walk out of crime scenes .
MARCHAND: Two months before he shot his wife , this guy had his investigator watching the cop at work . He knew exactly how it would go down - and he did n't leave any loose ends .
WILLY: Then what is this
MARCHAND: Had to see it for himself .
WILLY: See what ? They were out at the pool .
MARCHAND: The unmade bed . Her panties . Man 's gon na shoot his wife in the head , he needs to get himself all worked up .
WILLY: Yeah . Worked up . Marchand gets his jacket , pulls it on .
MARCHAND: Willy , go home . Tomorrow you go back into court and take your lumps - then you start your cushy new life , and you forget all about this one . And then you can lend me money and shit .
NUNALLY: It 's done . In the tool shed taped to the blade , inside the lawn-mower .
MONA: You okay ?
WILLY: Yeah . Maybe . Can I ask you to do something for me this morning ?
MONA: Sure .
WILLY: Write down your cell number . Once my trial is in session , wait outside . I might call - and just hang up . If I do , I want you to come into court and whisper to me that we got a tip about the murder weapon .
MONA: You found it ? Beat .
WILLY: I have n't decided yet .
MONA: Oh this came for you .
WILLY: So - between the time you heard the first gunshot and called 911 , and the time of Mr. Crawford 's arrest - you had the Crawford house in view ?
GIFFORD: Yes . I was very concerned about Jennifer . She was a lovely woman .
WILLY: No one but Thomas Crawford came in o out ?
GIFFORD: That 's correct .
WILLY: Thank you , Mr. Gifford . No furthe questions .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Crawford ?
CRAWFORD: Did you see the guy run out the back door ?
GIFFORD: What '' guy '' ?
CRAWFORD: The other guy . The one who shot my wife . Did you see him run out the ack of the house , carrying the gun ? Willy closes his eyes . Gifford grimaces .
GIFFORD: I could n't see the back of the house . I believethe police went around ack when they arrived .
CRAWFORD: No further questions . Willy immediately stands
WILLY: Re-direct , your honor .
CRAWFORD: I 've also written a motion to dismiss .
WILLY: Objection - I 'm on re-direct ! The Judge hesitates . Both men standing .
JUDGE ROBINSON: On what grounds , Mr. Crawford ?
CRAWFORD: The prosecutor does n't have any actual evidence .
WILLY: I 'm in the middle of presenting -
CRAWFORD: All of his witnesses are going to testify to the same facts that my wife was shot and that I was , tragically , in the house at the time a witness - and , in a way , a victim myself . I 'll stipulate to Mr. Slocum 's entire witness list right now , a request a directed verdict o dismissal , per California versus Collier , 1982 , and the Appellate court decision , v. Watrus , 486.19 .
JUDGE: Your legal skills seem to have improved over the long weekend , Mr. Crawford .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Slocum ? Willy and Crawford turn to the Judge .
WILLY: May I have a moment , your honor ? The Judge nods .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Slocum ?
CRAWFORD: Your honor ? Can we signal the prosecutor from here on planet Earth ?
JUDGE ROBINSON: Mr. Slocum ? Now or never . Willy wo n't look up . Nunally stares , agonized .
WILLY: I have no further evidence at this time , your honor . Crawford begins to smile .
JUDGE ROBINSON: Motion to dismiss is granted . Uproar . The Judge bangs his gavel -
CRAWFORD: Even a broken clock gets to be right twice a day . He winks , and heads up the aisle .
NIKKI: Hey , you .
WILLY: Hey .
NIKKI: What did you think - I was n't keeping tabs ?
WILLY: I do n't know what I thought .
NIKKI: Listen what do you say I take you out tonight and get you completely trashed ? Tomorrow 's just a travel da- - there 's a gun shot outside the courtroom .
WILLY: Hang on -
RESIDENT: Yeah , I understand -
WILLY: No , she was looking at me .
RESIDENT: The normal reflex goes downward . Up indicates brain trauma .
WILLY: She 's in there . She was looking at me .
RESIDENT: Sometimes we have to tape their eyes shut . They all move - they make sounds , they twitch . You think they 're dreaming . But they 're not . It 's just what 's left of the system , sending broken signals .
WILLY: Can we do other tests ? Like an M.R.I . or something ? And I want a coma specialist to see her .
RESIDENT: You 're not authorized to order tes-
WILLY: I 'll get you authorization . First thing tomorrow . The Resident studies Willy . Reluctantly
RESIDENT: You get the paperwork , I 'll do what I can .
CRAWFORD: Mr. Slocum .
WILLY: Justvisiting .
CRAWFORD: This is n't like you at all .
WILLY: No ?
CRAWFORD: You have n't got anything to gain .
WILLY: Oh - right . That 's my weak spot . Ever think about what yours might be ? Your flaw ?
CRAWFORD: Of course I have . The truth about me is , WillyI 'm eally not very nice .
WILLY: You sure do know a lot , though . Got everybody all figured out , everything set up , like one of your contraptions . Then you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to . Must be kind ofboring . At that point .
CRAWFORD: Not an ounce of sympathy , Willy ? Imagine it - imagine she was yours . And you knew you were losing her . Imagine days . Weeks . Going through her desk . Her purse . Her closet . Alone . Staring at her clothes . He shoes . Knowing this is what it will e like . After . Do you have any idea how hard it was to go on living - with her - every day , knowing ?
WILLY: But you had to , right ? You needed time to set it all upyour `` crime of passion . ''
CRAWFORD: There are many kinds of passion , Willy .
WILLY: Yeah . There are . So - thank you .
CRAWFORD: About ?
WILLY: Talking to her .
RECEPTIONIST: Who are you here to see ?
WILLY: I work here . Willy Slocum . I 'm new - He stops , realizing how he must look .
NIKKI: I told him .
WILLY: Great - who do I work with on it while you 're gone ?
NIKKI: You do n't work with anyone .
WILLY: Nikki the man has power-of-attorney and a health-care proxy , he can disconnect her life-support wheneve he wants . If we do n't move fast -
NIKKI: Jesus , Willy , wake up ! It 's over ! What is wrong with you - it 's first year law that woman could fully ecover and swear he shot her and it
WILLY: I told you - we bring a civil suit -
NIKKI: You 've got no standing .
WILLY: It does n't have to stick we just need to get a court order for now - to keep Crawford from pulling the plug ! With all the brain-power here , I 'm sure somebody can come up with a pretext o call in a favor . Then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a state- appointed conservatorship - so we can protect her while we fight him on -
NIKKI: What 's the point , Willy ?
WILLY: The point ? !
NIKKI: Yeah . What does that have to do with Wooton Sims ?
WILLY: No , this is insane .
NIKKI: It 's what it is .
WILLY: You 're not really just gon na let this happen , are you ? !
NIKKI: Oh I 'm supposed to lose my job ove your problems ? !
WILLY: My problems ? ! Wait a second - this is not about my anything any more -
JUDGE ROBINSON: What do the doctors say ?
WILLY: People wake up out of these things .
JUDGE ROBINSON: What did the doctors say , Mr. Slocum ?
WILLY: They saidthere 's no way to really know . I 'm trying to get them to run more tests - but I was there , and I 'm telling you .
JUDGE ROBINSON: I 'm sorry . I have no probable cause to issue a court order against Mr. Crawford - and he 's protected agai-
LOBRUTO: Have you been home at all today , Willy ?
WILLY: No - I 've been trying to get some-
LOBRUTO: There 's a court order out against you .
WILLY: What ?
LOBRUTO: A restraining order . You were at the hospital ? Talking to her doctors ?
WILLY: Against me .
LOBRUTO: You need to stay away from him , and his wife , and the hospital . He can have you arrested if you do n't . I 'm sorry . I ca n't help you . I told you how it would go .
WILLY: Can you do anything for her ? Beat .
LOBRUTO: I do n't see how . Willy grimaces . But nods . Turns away .
DR. LUNT: Has Mrs. Crawford been prepared ?
WILLY: Can I use your fax machine ?
GARDNER: These have to be served in person .
WILLY: Move it if you need to ! - running through the automatic doors .
NURSE: You just missed her .
WILLY: What ?
NURSE: She just went on up .
WILLY: How long agodid she die ?
NURSE: What ? The roof .
WILLY: He 's - moving her by helicopter ?
NURSE: Nothing but the best . We hear the surge of a jet engine - - as Willy runs out of the room .
DR. LUNT: This orders him not to take her off life support ! He 's not ! We ca n't stop the man from -
WILLY: Then just hold it - for a couple of hours ! Have it inspected !
DR. LUNT: You 're talking about a phenomenally expensive delay , Mr. Slocum - when the man has every right to move his wife !
WILLY: She 's not gon na get there !
PILOT: Less traffic . Willy looks at Crawford .
WILLY: We have to turn back !
PILOT: Get in your seat !
WILLY: He 's doing something - we have to turn ack !
PILOT: Who 's doing something ?
WILLY: He is ! You have to get us DOWN !
PILOT: Get back in your goddamn seat !
CRAWFORD: Willy , I 'm not doing anything . Everyone can see that .
WILLY: I 'm TELLING you , we have to TURN BACK ! He 's DOING SOMETH-
MED TECH: I do n't know - I 'm - there 's a - malfunction -
CRAWFORD: She 's D.N.R .
WILLY: What is it ?
CRAWFORD: Check .
WILLY: What ? The Med Tech looks up at Willy , scared .
MED TECH: She 's Do Not Resuscitate . Willy turns on Crawford . He shrugs .
CRAWFORD: It 's in her living will . The Med Tech looks at Willy , paralyzed .
MED TECH: She 's D.N.R . She signed it .
WILLY: There 's a restraining order - she 's protected - I 'm authorizing you to do it ! The Med Tech turns to Crawford , uncertain -
CRAWFORD: No extraordinary measures . Unless your court order specifies
WILLY: Wait ! WAIT - LOOK ! Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked -
CRAWFORD: You pushed it , Willy . We did n't have to be here . But now you 're my witness . You saw I did n't touch anything , I did n't do anything . The machine went down . Anybody asks - you 'll have to tell them . What you saw . That 's really kind of perfect , is n't it ?
LOBRUTO: You 're not answering your phone . Beat .
WILLY: That 's kind of an answer in itself , is n't it ? Willy heads back in , starts to pack again .
LOBRUTO: Where are you headed ?
WILLY: Have n't decided yet . Just someplace else . Lobruto nods . Willy packs .
LOBRUTO: I should n't have let it get so far out of control . We all lose , Willy .
WILLY: Yep .
LOBRUTO: We just have to live with that , and keep fighting the good fight .
WILLY: That 's not what I was doing .
LOBRUTO: You belong in a courtroom .
WILLY: I need to - get to know myself better .
LOBRUTO: You 're a good lawyer . All this may have even made you a better lawyer . Do n't waste it . Willy turns on him - angry , confused , bitter
WILLY: I did n't just lose a case ! I let a man get away with murder .
LOBRUTO: If it makes you feel any better - technically , you let a man get away with attempted murder . Willy does n't respond . Keeps packing . Lobruto goes out .
WILLY: His wife is dead !
LOBRUTO: Willy Willy comes toward him - excited , insistent
WILLY: Double jeopardy does n't apply ! We ing a new charge - of homicide .
LOBRUTO: Willy - what happened to you , on the helicopter - we do n't even know if we could prove -
WILLY: No he shot her and she died . The fact that it took time - the fact that he went to trial in between , just fo shooting her - does n't matter . He fired a gun and caused her death , and that 's murder . If he can twist the law around - then so can we . Lobruto thinks it out . Wary .
LOBRUTO: A second indictment on the same incident ?
WILLY: A man burns down a house ; we charge him with arson . There were people sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in the hospital , they die . We 'd charge him with murder . Right ?
LOBRUTO: All your evidence is still toxic . The confession , the arrest - it 's all still inadmissible .
WILLY: I 'll get something new .
LOBRUTO: How ? Willy looks up at him . Calm now .
WILLY: You do n't want to know .
LOBRUTO: Willy , you ca n't -
WILLY: I do n't work for you . Right ?
LOBRUTO: Do n't do anything crazy .
WILLY: What else have we got left ? Willy disappears inside .
CRAWFORD: These are from that thing at the courthouse , right ?
WILLY: Uh-huh .
CRAWFORD: Very dramatic .
WILLY: You ai n't seen nothin ' yet .
CRAWFORD: Why ? You 've already got one .
WILLY: I want the gun you shot your wife with . Now . Crawford does n't move .
CRAWFORD: You 're serious , are n't you .
WILLY: Oh , yes .
CRAWFORD: Willy . You got religion , did n't you ? ! You care . That'spriceless .
WILLY: Gon na be a whole lot less funny in about a minute .
CRAWFORD: Getting it like this is that going to hold up in court ?
WILLY: I do n't work for the D.A . any more . I 'm just a guy who broke into you house . When the police arrest me - they 'll inventory anything in my possession . If that happens to be crucial evidence in another case , well some prosecutor just got lucky .
CRAWFORD: It takes a very special kind of person to look right into someone 's eyes and pull the trigger . It takes a unique kind of strength .
WILLY: I guess you 'd know that .
CRAWFORD: Yes . I would . Willy cocks the gun . Crawford shakes his head . Eyes on Willy .
WILLY: You do n't know me .
CRAWFORD: No ?
WILLY: It 's Nunally 's .
CRAWFORD: Nunally 's . Really .
WILLY: Yeah . Really .
CRAWFORD: Willy . Put it down .
WILLY: I thought you might appreciate the irony . Willy 's finger tightens on the trigger .
CRAWFORD: Willy . Think . And Willy does . Hesitating . Distracted , by a thought .
WILLY: The exact same type of gun you bought your wife , a month before . He looks up at Crawford . Getting it .
CRAWFORD: If they see you with a gun in you hand - they 're not likely to ask a lot of questions .
WILLY: That 's why you went to the hotel .
CRAWFORD: I gave it back .
WILLY: Yes you did .
CRAWFORD: He hadother things on his mind .
WILLY: Brilliant .
CRAWFORD: You know , this is really kind of fun . It 's like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter .
WILLY: This caveman 's gon na put you in prison for the rest of your life .
CRAWFORD: It 's still not evidence , Willy . There 's no prints left by now . Nothing ties that gun to me .
WILLY: No . That would be true . Except fo all those eggs .
CRAWFORD: Those what ?
WILLY: With all those little cracks and weak places . Like Nunally . Shooting himself , right there in the courthouse . I did n't think he was going to do that . Did you ?
CRAWFORD: No .
WILLY: I mean , we all knew he was going to fall apart sooner or later . That was part of your plan , right ? Like a bank shot , on a pool table you kill you wife - and destroy her lover . With one bullet . Well four bullets , actually . Right ?
FRANCES: It usually worked . God became a superfather that could n't spank me . But if I wanted a thing badly enough , He arranged it .
ERNEST: Bye , baby .
FRANCES: See you next weekend , Dad .
WOMAN: You 're going straight to hell , Frances Farmer !
KAMINSKI: And do you think it 's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family ?
ANNOUNCER: Seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dolla prize with an essay denying God .
LILLIAN: Frances has not turned her back on the Lord , they 're just having a momentary difference of opinion . What child has n't questioned the Lord 's mysteries in order to bette understand them ? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire , I may not agree with what she says , but I 'll defend to the death her right to say it . Freedom of speech , unlike in the dark countries to the east , still lives in America ! And in my home .
FRANCES: Hi Emma . Emma looks away quickly , returns to her play .
MAN'S VOICE: Hey ! Frances hesitates , then turns to look
HARRY: C'mere . I wan na talk to you .
FRANCES: Do n't touch me .
HARRY: I 'm not gon na hurt you . I just wan na talk .
FRANCES: Okay then
HARRY: Well you 're causin ' trouble , you know that ?
FRANCES: I 'm causing trouble ? ! You 're a pain in the butt ! You newshounds 've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest . I 'm just sixteen , you know ? Who the hell cares what I think ?
HARRY: Not me . But other people seem to .
FRANCES: Yeah . Well if you did n't put it in the papers nobody 'd even know about it .
HARRY: Now wait a minute , sweetie . Do I look like a newshound to you ?
FRANCES: No Actually , you look more like a cop . Harry laughs .
HARRY: That 's rich . Hey , if I was a cop , I 'd be packing , right ? You see a gun ? Go on , search me . Pat me down .
FRANCES: I 'll take your word for it . So who are you , then ?
HARRY: Harry York . I work for Martoni Kaminski , he 's running for Congress here .
FRANCES: Oh yeah ! I saw you in the newsreel !
HARRY: Yeah , well
FRANCES: You know , my Dad 's done some work for Kaminski
HARRY: Now you 're catchin ' on . Do n't wan na get your Daddy in hot water , do you ?
FRANCES: Whattaya mean ?
HARRY: Well see the papers 've got us pegged as pinkos , then you come along , the friendly neighborhood atheist
FRANCES: But I 'm not . The newspapers 're
HARRY: Right again . You 're no more an atheist than my man 's a Red , but what they 're doin ' , see , they 're addin ' up thei version of your ideas with thei version of ours . Could look bad fo your Daddy .
FRANCES: Yeah . Could look bad for you and Kaminski too , I guess . Beat .
HARRY: Sure do n't talk like you 're sixteen .
FRANCES: Well are n't you the smoothie . Now you 're going to ask for my number , I suppose .
HARRY: I suppose not . Got ta ask you this , though for all our sakes , you bette keep your trap shut .
FRANCES: Well I 'll give it a try , Mr. York .
HARRY: Harry .
FRANCES: Harry .
HARRY: Bye .
HILLIER: These are perilous times . With the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation ; and people turn to dangerous ideas
WOMAN'S VOICE: I know .
HILLIER: Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant . Who 's behind this , her mother ?
STYLES: Impossible . As her attorney , I 've known her for years .
HILLIER: What about the father , he 's a little pink . Maybe he wants to show ou schools in a bad light , shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals .
STYLES: He 's no influence ; he does n't even live at home . No , I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended . It was her teacher who entered it in the competition .
HILLIER: Well , the publicity must stop . It 's no good for Seattle and no good fo the country . Keep an eye on this , will you , Alma ?
STYLES: Of course , your honor .
ERNEST: It always amazes me , Lil , how you can whip up a hot , hearty meal out of thin air .
LILLIAN: I can thank you for that . It was a hard-earned talent .
ERNEST: Thank you .
LILLIAN: When 's the last time you saw a hundred dollars , Ernest Farmer ?
FRANCES: Mama
LILLIAN: I 'm not hungry . You two just enjoy yourselves . After all , this is a celebration . She leaves . A long silence .
ERNEST: I 'm I 'm really proud of you , Frances .
FRANCES: Thanks , Dad .
ERNEST: An essay contest a national contest . That 's pretty impressive .
FRANCES: I did n't have much to do with it .
ERNEST: You wrote it , did n't you ?
FRANCES: Yeah , I suppose Dad , who 's Harry York ?
ERNEST: Well , Harry York is a guy who well , he does a lot of things . Why do you ask ?
FRANCES: He talked to me today . Told me to keep my mouth shut or I 'd get everybody in trouble .
ERNEST: Yeah well it 's possible . Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski ight now , and well There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break . That 's the way of things , but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it , and when it comes to new ideas , the people in power get nervous .
FRANCES: Is Kaminski a Communist ?
ERNEST: No , no , no . All he wants to do is see the common man get a little epresentation .
FRANCES: He 's a socialist , then ?
LILLIAN: Do n't listen to him , little sister . When you 're proud of what you are , you do n't refuse the label , understand ?
FRANCES: Yes , Ma .
LILLIAN: And you should be proud . You won that contest and made a name fo yourself .
ERNEST: I have a right to talk to her . She 's my daughter , and she 's beginning to understand why I 've sacrificed so much in order to achieve
LILLIAN: You 've sacrificed ? ! If you 'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents
ERNEST: They need help , Lil . They pay me ack in other ways .
LILLIAN: How ? What do they do for you , Kaminski and his friends ? They 're all anarchists ! Traitors !
ERNEST: No , Lil . It 's just you ca n't understand their brand of patriotism .
LILLIAN: That 's right . I ca n't understand a man who puts strangers over his family , a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure . Beat .
ERNEST: I 'm going back to the hotel .
LILLIAN: Good .
ERNEST: See you next weekend ?
LILLIAN: As usual . Everything as usual , Mr. Farmer . Just give me my due .
ERNEST: Lillian I 'm more than willing to meet you halfway .
LILLIAN: Do n't make me sick . I 'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound .
ERNEST: That 's a thought , Lil . That sure is a thought .
NEIGHBOR'S VOICE: Are you all right , dear ?
LILLIAN: I 'm fine , perfectly fine .
FRANCES: Dad , please , do n't leave early . Just ecause of Mama
ERNEST: Francie , you 'll learn that sometimes it 's best to stay low and just walk away . He trudges out and down the walk .
FRANCES: What can we do , we must live ! We shall live , Uncle Vanya
HARRY: Not bad , Farmer . Not half bad .
DRAMA TEACHER: Art is a constant struggle . Some of you have the will but not the ability . For others , the opposite . I do n't wish to be harsh , but only one of you on stage tonight combined the two The front door opens . Frances and Chet enter .
GIRL #1: I could really learn to hate her .
GIRL #2: Stand in line .
DRAMA TEACHER: This is the answer a subscription drive to `` Voice of Action ! '' First prize is a trip to Moscow ! You could visit the art theatre , maybe even meet Stanislavski !
FRANCES: But I 'll never win that .
DRAMA TEACHER: Yes , yes , it 's all arranged . Everyone 's collecting subscriptions in your name . And the best part is the trip returns you to New York .
FRANCES: Really ?
DRAMA TEACHER: New York , Frances ! Broadway ! This is your chance ! You belong on the stage !
FRANCES: Thank you .
HARRY: You think I 'd miss it ?
FRANCES: Well ? What 'd you think ?

HARRY: What ?
FRANCES: Quietly .
HARRY: You 're not the quiet type , Frances . They are silent for a while .
FRANCES: What happened to him ?
HARRY: He retired to Florida made a killing in vending machines . He grins ironically and Frances laughs .
FRANCES: So you think I should go .
HARRY: Sure . Try this acting thing . You can make good money at it .
FRANCES: I do n't know , Harry . I I want so many
HARRY: You do n't know what you want .

FRANCES: You act like I 'm a bomb-thrower , Mama . It 's just a trip .
LILLIAN: But they 're using you !
FRANCES: Oh Ma , they 're not using me . It 's just a chance to travel , see things . Besides , it 's the only way I can get to New York .
LILLIAN: I 'll pay your way to New York . I 'll work , I 'll slave . I 'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers , or
FRANCES: Oh , Mama , do n't you understand ?
LILLIAN: I never taught you that ! Frances keeps walking .
FRANCES: It is n't in your hands , Mama . It 's my life .
LILLIAN: Yes , but important people are concerned about this . Judge Hillie spoke to Alma Styles
FRANCES: I do n't care .
LILLIAN: You will .
FRANCES: What do I do , Dad ?
ERNEST: You really want to go ?
FRANCES: Of course .
ERNEST: And you think it 's worth all this ?
FRANCES: If I did n't , I would n't put you through it .

They 're sending my daughter to the heartland of darkness . . .the dark forces that would overthrow our country . Your country . My country .

HARRY: What 're you gon na do , waste you talent ? Why not use it to make something worthwhile . You can do that , you know ?
FRANCES: Yeah , if I do n't make too big an ass of myself .
HARRY: Tell you what . Let 's ditch the limo . Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy .
FRANCES: The hell you will , Harry York .
HARRY: Come on , Cinderella , your pumpkin awaits .
FRANCES: Bong bong bong The coat falls .
HARRY: Do n't start , Farmer .
FRANCES: It 's midnight , Harry . My glittering aiments are dissolving .
HARRY: The chauffeur . He 's watching .
FRANCES: He deserves a show . He missed the movie .
HARRY: I 'm serious , Frances . This is important .
FRANCES: I know .
HARRY: Hot damn !
CLAIRE: Hi Frances , got a minute ?
FRANCES: Sure , Claire . If you do n't mind walking my way . They walk toward the dressing room .
CLAIRE: Well , I suppose I should just say it . It 's your clothes .
FRANCES: My clothes ?
CLAIRE: Yeah , I mean slacks and work clothes and that awful car
FRANCES: It 's a perfectly good car . It runs .
CLAIRE: Yes , but Really , I hate to sound it 's just that the public expects something different from its stars . People wo n't take you seriously .
FRANCES: I do n't care if my clothes are taken seriously . Or my car .
CLAIRE: You know what I mean .
FRANCES: Uh-huh . You mean what if the public finds out I perspire ? And wear slacks . And drive an old jalopy ? What if they find out I 'm a real person . Oh no ! Say it ai n't so ! Not a real person ! Claire is laughing . They go inside .
CLAIRE: That 's not all , Frances . Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics . He hears you 've been donating money , speaking at rallies .
FRANCES: Yup . Claire please , please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life , we 'd make a lot better movies .
CLAIRE: I 'm sorry , Frances . It 's my job , you know ?
FRANCES: I know . 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs . The writer writes , the director directs , and the actress '
CLAIRE: acts . I 'll relay your message .
DICK: Yes , of course she 'll make a statement on women 's rights . Call back tomorrow , okay ?
FRANCES: Sort of .
DICK: There 've been some calls .
FRANCES: Who ?
DICK: Well about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called , what 's her name ?
FRANCES: Claire ?
DICK: Yeah , Claire . She said she was fired . Too bad , huh ?
FRANCES: Fired ?
DICK: Yeah . She said she delivered you message and that you 'd understand . Frances looks stricken . Dick presses on .
FRANCES: Yes .
DICK: Without me .
FRANCES: Showdown .
DICK: You were n't going to tell me , were you ? Just pack up and leave , is that it ?
FRANCES: Dick , we need some time apart
DICK: Hey , I 'm not a complete fool , you know . I can see you 're going sour on me , and when I try to do something about it , you turn your back and say it 's nothing .
FRANCES: Dick , I ca n't even breathe here
DICK: Dwayne ! I 'm Dwayne now ! And you damn well better get used to it !
FRANCES: Dick
DICK: I do n't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too , that I might want to do theatre ? No , 'cause you do n't want me along , do you ? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock .
FRANCES: No ?
DICK: No . It 's all about that night , is n't it ?
FRANCES: What night ?
DICK: The premiere . I never pressed you about it but god damn it , you 're gon na tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were !
FRANCES: You want his name ? Dick is crumbling inside .
DICK: What ?
FRANCES: My God I think you 're overplaying this a bit ?
CLURMAN: The Group is more than a theatre company . It 's the embodiment of an ideal . Our approach allows the acto to be an artist in the fullest sense , a creative individual and an instrument of change . You see
FRANCES: Really , Mr. Clurman , you do n't have to sell me .
CLURMAN: Forgive my indulgence . Seems we always lecture those who are on time fo those who are tardy . The point is , Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play . Most of the roles are cast , ut we have n't found our female lead
FRANCES: Who is she ?
ODETS: She 's a tramp from Newark .
CLURMAN: Forgive me , but I think you 'd be perfect for the part .
ODETS: Miss Farmer , for me this is not a play it 's an assault a seduction a plea for understanding . I think we live in a time when new art works should shoot bullets and you make very attractive ammunition .
FRANCES: And what 's the title of this seduc assault ?
ODETS: 'Golden Boy . '
FRANCES: Hi . He nods .
ODETS: You see that girl ?
FRANCES: That 's me , Clifford .
ODETS: I know , but I 'm not seeing it . It 's there , Frances , the fire is there , ut it 's not coming through . You 're lazy
FRANCES: I 'm not !
ODETS: Yes , you win them , you bring them into your heart , touch them , but you do n't set them on fire !
FRANCES: But I want to . I 'm trying !
ODETS: I need an incendiary ! An arsonist !
FRANCES: Then show me ! That 's what I 'm here for , to learn , to grow !
ODETS: Good . Then it 's very simple . You have to stop being afraid , Frances . It 's in you .
CLURMAN: Not only an artist , but an instrument of change . We must look to the world around us , not content to observe , but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs . We will not stand idly by as Fascist ombs obliterate democracy . We contribute our profits , for if fascism is not stopped in Spain , it will spread across Europe , jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive . ( presenting check to
SPANISH CONSUL: The artist , to be vital , must be a soldier too .
FRANCES: I 'm not afraid of struggle , Clifford .
CLIFFORD: Yes you are . We all are . The first step is to acknowledge our fear .
FRANCES: I 'm not !
CLIFFORD: You 're afraid !
FRANCES: I 'm not !
CLIFFORD: You do n't want to show your whole soul ugly , mis-shapen , and pitiful you do n't want to show it
FRANCES: God damn it , Clifford , will you shut up ! I tell you , I want to give these things ! I want to give them to the audience , and I can give them , I will give them , so shut up ! She is seething . Gorgeous . Alive . He smiles , watching her .
CLIFFORD: Good , good . Give them that .
FRANCES: What ?
CLIFFORD: Madam ?
FRANCES: Thank you .
CLIFFORD: Oh my God ! Frances , I 'm such a cad . I ca n't go through with this . My wife is in Europe , but this is he house her bedroom . I ca n't ask you to
FRANCES: Oh well . I guess I better leave then .
CLIFFORD: Okay , but come here first .
FRANCES: Huh .
CLIFFORD: Come here . I want to show you something . He opens the bedroom door .
LAWYER: And on top of her political activities , now she 's got a lawyer . She wants out of her contract , Mr. Bebe . She says she 's through with motion pictures .
BEBE: I 'm sure it was n't me , it was n't me
LAWYER: Excuse me , sir ?
BEBE: I do n't know who she fucked to get where she is , but I do n't think it was me .
LAWYER: Well you could always dump her , Mr. Bebe . Teach her a lesson . There are a million beautiful girls out there who do n't give a damn about politics .
BEBE: That 's not the point . Frances Farme has the world by the tit because of this studio , and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you . No . No , that young lady has a contract , and she 's going to hono it .
LAWYER: Oh . I mean , good .
BEBE: I think it 's time to take the gloves off . Get me some reporters . Particularly Louella Parsons !
YOUNG MAN: Miss Farmer I 've never done this efore but I had to tell ya ' you 're great ! He shyly hands her the flower .
FRANCES: Thank you very much . I 'm glad you liked the play .
YOUNG MAN: I 'm really sad it 's closing . Now what am I gon na do on Tuesday nights ?
FRANCES: You can always come see it in London .
YOUNG MAN: Only if you were in it . Are you ?
FRANCES: I would n't miss it .
YOUNG MAN: Boy , I 'd love to but I 'm going to Hollywood .
FRANCES: Are you an actor ?
YOUNG MAN: Hell yes ! well , okay , I 'm still in school . But as soon as I graduate California , here I come !
FRANCES: Are you really serious ? About acting ?
YOUNG MAN: Why yes .
FRANCES: Then do n't go to Hollywood .
YOUNG MAN: Why ?
FRANCES: I 'm telling you straight , if you have any serious ambitions , stay clear of the place . It 'll crush you .
YOUNG MAN: You sound as if you hate it .
FRANCES: No , I do n't hate it . Again she walks on . He follows .
YOUNG MAN: Are n't you ever going back ?
FRANCES: Not if I can help it .
YOUNG MAN: Gosh ! You 'll break a lot of hearts .
FRANCES: They 'll mend .
YOUNG MAN: What about your husband ?
FRANCES: What ?
YOUNG MAN: Will you be getting back together ? When you quit Hollywood , I mean .
FRANCES: What is this ?
YOUNG MAN: Is it true you 're getting a divorce ? Comrade ?
FRANCES: Why , you you little bastard ! The Young Man grins .
YOUNG MAN: Thanks for our chat , Miss Farmer . Be seeing you . He begins to walk away .
FRANCES: Just one minute
YOUNG MAN: You 're wasting your time , lady . Nothing 's off the record with me . He is gone .
ODETS: How 'd it go ?
FRANCES: 'But how do I know you love me ? '
ODETS: Your big speech ?
FRANCES: 'How do I know it 's true ? You 'll get to be the champ . They 'll all want you , all the girls ! But I do n't care . I 've been undersea a long time . When they 'd put their hands on me I used to say , `` This is n't it ! This is n't what I mean ! '' It 's been a mysterious world for me ! But Joe , I think you 're it ! I do n't know why , I think you 're it . Take me home with you . '
ODETS: I already have . She nods , turns her back to him .
FRANCES: How 's it sound ?
ODETS: The speech ? Real good .
FRANCES: You think I got it ?
ODETS: You got it .
FRANCES: Yeah . Yeah , tonight I think I got it . She is crying .
FRANCES: Hello , Harold .
CLURMAN: Frances .
FRANCES: Where 's Clifford ?
CLURMAN: He 's not here .
FRANCES: Oh . She sits .
CLURMAN: Bourbon ? He pours . She drinks hers , watching him .
FRANCES: What 's up ?
CLURMAN: I hear you 're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract .
FRANCES: That 's right . I do n't want them eathing down my neck while we 're in London .
CLURMAN: Well well , you see , that 's the point . You wo n't be opening in London .
FRANCES: You do n't think I 'm good enough ?
CLURMAN: What ? ! Good Lord no , it 's just It 's money . We needed backing and well , we found it .
FRANCES: Who ?
CLURMAN: An actress .
FRANCES: A rich actress .
CLURMAN: Yes . That 's the deal . She plays Lorna .
FRANCES: But but wait a minute . We 're supposed to be different , right ? Clifford says This theatre is supposed to be different ! And this play this play is all about what greed and money do to people !
CLURMAN: I know , but
FRANCES: What does Clifford say ?
CLURMAN: Right now we have to be practical .
FRANCES: Does Clifford even know ? You did n't tell him , did you ? I 'm gon na tell him . Where is he ?
CLURMAN: He knows , Frances .
FRANCES: Prick !

HARRY: I know , Frances I know .
DIRECTOR: Good , good . One more time .
FRANCES: For God 's sake why ?
DIRECTOR: Because we want to get it perfect just the right combination of fury and confusion . You can understand that , ca n't you , Miss Farmer ? We 're serious artists here , right ? Right .
FRANCES: Look , Mr. Bebe , you can hold me to my contract , but you ca n't break me . I 'm back , and I 'm gon na make the est of it .

COP: Hey !
FRANCES: Take a look .
HARRY: Very tasty . She smiles .
FRANCES: Nope . The studio pays . Thank you , Harry .
HARRY: What for ?
FRANCES: For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter .
HARRY: Well , I would have , you know ? I just did n't know how to cook it . She laughs .
FRANCES: I took the early rounds .
HARRY: I 'll bet .
FRANCES: I do n't know . It hurts , Harry . Some things , no matter what you do with them , they just hurt .
HARRY: So you drink , and you fight with a cop ?
FRANCES: Yeah , and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are , what 's going on inside their heads . Sometimes you can hear it , like a buzzing , the things that happen in their heads . And you wonder does anybody eve love anybody , really ?

FRANCES: Sure it 's true . I was fighting fo my country as well as myself .
JUDGE: Miss Farmer , you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen Frances moves closer to the bench .
FRANCES: Are you telling me you did n't have a little rum in your pineapple juice this morning ? I can smell it from here , Your Honor . The courtroom erupts into surprised laughter .
JUDGE: That 's enough !
FRANCES: It 's the truth ! I can smell it from here you old hypocrite !

REPORTER: Oh my God , she 's loose !
FRANCES: Harry !
REPORTER: With what must surely be the final act of madness , the curtain falls on Frances Farmer 's once promising career . The crazed blonde who at
WOMAN: and we feel that this would be more appropriate .
JUDGE: a difficult decision , but , I 'm sure , the proper one .
FRANCES: What ?
LILLIAN: It 's alright now , little sister , everything 's going to be just fine .
FRANCES: Mama , what 's
LILLIAN: Shhh , shhh . You 're not going to jail , Frances . The Judge has put you unde my care . I 'll see you get the rest you need .
FRANCES: You 're taking me home !
LILLIAN: First things first , little sister . Trust me .
LILLIAN: Why it 's beautiful here ! What a view !
MAN: Good afternoon , Miss Farmer . I 'm Dr. Symington .
LILLIAN: Good afternoon , Doctor .
SYMINGTON: I 'm very pleased to meet you , Mrs. Farmer . I 'm sure we 'll have more of a chance to talk later . Right now I think it 's important that you daughter have a chance to settle in . Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here .
LILLIAN: Oh . Well , I have some background that you should probably know about if you 're
SYMINGTON: I have no doubt , Mrs. Farmer . If you 'll speak to the girl at the desk , she 'll arrange an appointment .
LILLIAN: I 'll be back real soon , little sister . You be a good girl .
FRANCES: Mama ! Lillian turns back expectantly .
LILLIAN: You 'll see , little sister . Everything will be fine . The doctors know best .
SYMINGTON: I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned elatives in attendance .
FRANCES: Am I supposed to say 'thank you ' ?
SYMINGTON: Thanks are hardly necessary .
FRANCES: Aw , shucks , ma'am . T'were n't nothin ' .
SYMINGTON: I 'm glad to see you have n't lost your sense of humor .
FRANCES: It ai n't for lack of trying .
SYMINGTON: So it seems . May we be serious for a moment ?
FRANCES: Why , Doctor ! We 've only just met ! He reddens ever so slightly and looks away .
SYMINGTON: I feel I 've known you for a long time you see , I 've followed you career you 're a fascinating case I 'm looking forward to resolving your predicament . Frances ' face begins to set in hard planes .
FRANCES: Oh ! Are you really ?
SYMINGTON: Among persons such as yourself , creative people under great stress , erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of . It 's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain characte disabilities which
FRANCES: Do you expect me , for one moment , to elieve you have greater insight into my personality than I do ?
SYMINGTON: Please sit down
FRANCES: You may discuss my predicament , Doctor . You may discuss it with anyone you like , but not with me . I 'm not interested . I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian .
SYMINGTON: I see .
FRANCES: Besides , I do n't want to be what you want to make me .
SYMINGTON: And what 's that ?
FRANCES: Normal . Average .
SYMINGTON: All right . Will you please sit down now ? Symington says .
FRANCES: Did you really say that ?
SYMINGTON: Just a little joke , Miss Farmer .
FRANCES: This whole thing is a joke !
SYMINGTON: Stay calm , please .
FRANCES: No , you stay calm , Doctor ! But you 're finding that difficult , are n't you ? Why , are you attracted to me ? Perhaps later , in some of our more intimate sessions after we know each othe a little better and you 've torn my personality to shreds , and I 'm weeping and vulnerable then you 'll really get your kicks , wo n't you , `` Doctor ? ''
SYMINGTON: I 'll have someone show you to you oom .
FRANCES: Oh , that 's good , very professional . In control . But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away .
SYMINGTON: You really should get some rest now . Nurse will meet you outside . Good day .
FRANCES: You did n't say 'Symington says ' .
SYMINGTON: Symington says .
LILLIAN: Not much on hospital corners , are you ?
MATRON: You Farmer ?
FRANCES: So this is the nuthouse The Nurse smiles confidentially at her .
NURSE: Honey take my word for it . This is a resort .
LILLIAN: Tell them who I am ! Tell them who I am !
FRANCES: Are you crazy ? Unhand that woman ! That 's Amelia Earhart !
THIN NURSE: It 's insulin . It throws your body into shock .
LILLIAN: and here 's the one from Duluth . A war widow with five children . She works in a defense plant and she 's very worried about you . I answered her that she should n't let worry over you affect her vital work ; and that you 'd be back on the silve screen in no time .
FRANCES: Why are these all opened ?
LILLIAN: Well , they needed immediate answers , Frances . It 's good manners and good sense . You should n't be bothering yourself with these right now .
FRANCES: Then why did you bring them ?
LILLIAN: It 's your fan mail , little sister .
FRANCES: You kill me , Mama .
LILLIAN: What ?
FRANCES: Go on
SYMINGTON: I 'm sorry to keep you waiting , the staff review ran over . Did you enjoy your mother 's visit ?
FRANCES: Yes . It was very good to see her .
SYMINGTON: Really ? Any problems ?
FRANCES: Not at all . She brought me my fan mail . I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me . But I guess that 's the best thing about working in the movies . You make so many friends . I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me was n't a mistake .
SYMINGTON: You 're telling me you feel guilty .
FRANCES: No What I mean is I 'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life , that 's all .
SYMINGTON: Do you really believe your mother 's trying to kill you ?
FRANCES: What ?
SYMINGTON: She told me you said , `` Mama , you want to kill me . ''
FRANCES: I never said Oh look . That 's just a figure of speech . She said something funny , and I said
SYMINGTON: And you accused her of tampering with your mail .
FRANCES: Oh for Christ 's
SYMINGTON: But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative . Whom do you think I should believe ?
FRANCES: Doctor , I hate to break this to you , ut my mother is a little batty .
SYMINGTON: Frances , you 're still filled with anxiety . You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends . Consequently , I did n't recommend your release at the staff review .
FRANCES: You what ?
SYMINGTON: Mental illness is an elusive thing , and though I 'm pleased you 're feeling more capable , it 's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time . Do n't you agree ? Frances stares at him . Stunned . Horrified .
FRANCES: Dr. Symington , how big is your dick ?
SYMINGTON: Huh ?
FRANCES: 'Cause if it 's long enough , which I doubt , why do n't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass ! Symington smiles patronizingly .
SYMINGTON: Frances , I 'm warning you
FRANCES: No , I 'm warning you ! Who do you think you are , God ? You bumble around with your folders and your pencils and your god-damn buttons all your badges of authority ! But you have no authority ! You 're nothing ! You 're a zero !
ORDERLY: Doc ?
FRANCES: Symington says
SYMINGTON: Sedate her . They haul her away .
FRANCES: Oh my God , I look awful .
HARRY: You 've looked a whole lot better . C'mon .
FRANCES: They 're doin ' stuff to me , Harry . Can you see it ? You feel it ? They 're putting stuff in my food or something , my water , and they 're using it to put thoughts in my head . You understand ? They 're trying to re- arrange what 's in my head , they 're trying to drive me crazy ! Oh , Harry !
ATTENDANT: Oh , Miss Farmer ! Time for your bath , Miss Farmer !

HARRY: Forget it , Frances . You 're not driving .

HARRY: Couple hours from Idaho . We 'll cut across to Montana . I 've got friends there with a ranch .

FRANCES: This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone
HARRY: That 's right .
FRANCES: Take advantage of me . Harry laughs .
HARRY: Whattaya think you 're in now ?
FRANCES: I do n't know . Not a war exactly . It 's more a a misapprehension maybe
HARRY: Huh ?
FRANCES: A misunderstanding , people taking the wrong meaning from things . I was n't declaring war , Harry . I was just saying my prayers . Harry looks at her quizzically .
HARRY: Who to ? Beat .
FRANCES: Harry , I have to go home . I have to talk to Mama .
HARRY: Frances , you 're fulla drugs . You do n't know what you 're saying . Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood ? Your mother thinks you 're crazy and she 'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her .
FRANCES: No , she just did n't want me going to jail , that 's all .
HARRY: Yeah ? She 's a shark , Frances . I 'm not taking you there , and that 's that !
FRANCES: You know something , Harry ?
HARRY: I guess .
FRANCES: Aside from meanness , you 're almost perfect . There 's only one other thing wrong with you .
HARRY: What 's that ?
FRANCES: You ca n't drink .
HARRY: Hey ! Another shot for the lady and a double for me !
FRANCES: What a man !
HARRY: Hey , you 're a good quarter-horse , kid , but you ca n't go a route of ground .

HARRY: No . To thoroughbreds . He knocks back his drink .
BING'S VOICE: Love is so terrific Such a funny feeling Makes you want to cuddle And coo

HARRY: Huh ?
FRANCES: You should stickaround sometimes . Look out for me .
HARRY: Look , Frances , I 'm only gon na ask this one time . I mean it . I swea after this , I 'll never ask again Will you marry me ?
FRANCES: I know a thing or two about marriage . You you understand me more than anyone , Harry maybe even more than Mama . But you 're too important to me . I 'd fail you . I do n't know how or why , but I would . And that 's a chance I just ca n't take . Do you understand ?
HARRY: Well I 'll act like I do until I do . They are silent for a moment .
FRANCES: What 's that ?

HARRY: Frances , You 're crazy .
FRANCES: I know . Do n't tell anyone .
HARRY: Anyway if you need me
FRANCES: I got your number , Mister Man .
LILLIAN: Welcome home , little sister .
FRANCES: Well , who have we here ?
LILLIAN: Frances , you remember my lawyer , Alma Styles ?
STYLES: Hello , Frances . You seem to be having quite a time of it .
LILLIAN: I called Alma because I think we 'll need
STYLES: Frances , the doctors at Meadow Wood have petitioned the court for you eturn . Your mother has asked me to intervene so you can stay here .
LILLIAN: I swear I did n't know what they were doing to you . I would n't have let them
FRANCES: It 's okay , Mama . It 's okay .
STYLES: You realize , of course , your mothe is now your legal guardian . In the eyes of the law , you no longer have any rights as an adult . You 're going to have to hold your tongue and be selective about whom you mix with . That man who drove you here , fo instance
FRANCES: You leave him out of this !
LILLIAN: Frances , please do n't
STYLES: Never mind . We wo n't have to worry about him much longer .
FBI MAN: How ya doin ' , Al ?
HARRY: You got the wrong guy . Name 's Slocum .
FBI MAN: No , it ai n't . And it ai n't Harry York , neither .
HARRY: Look , I 'm tellin ' you
FBI MAN: I 'd give you till ten , Al , but we ai n't got the time .
HILLIER: Alvin Hanson , a.k.a . Ronald Burns , Thomas Slocum , Harry York Mr. Hanson , this warrant has been outstanding for many years . Normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency , but the crime you committed inciting to riot and the cause you sought to promote a worker 's rebellion are such anathemas to this court that I feel compelled to mete out the full sentence . I only wish it were longer . Six months in the state penitentiary .
LILLIAN: Frances , play 'Flow Gently Sweet Afton ' . Frances ' brows mesh .
FRANCES: Oh Mama , I 'm so tired of that song .
LILLIAN: Please . I want you to . It would make me so happy .
FRANCES: I think I need a little air .
LILLIAN: What 's wrong ?
FRANCES: Nothing . I think I 'll just go out for awhile .
LILLIAN: Where are you going ?
FRANCES: For a walk , Mama . Just a walk . She gets up and Lillian rouses herself .
LILLIAN: How long will you be ?
FRANCES: Not long .
LILLIAN: I 'll have lunch ready by one .
FRANCES: I 'll be back .
LILLIAN: At one . Promise ?
FRANCES: Sure .
LILLIAN: Say you promise .
FRANCES: I promise I 'll I promise , Mama .
LILLIAN: You know , the surest way to lose an appetite , is to drink , little sister .
FRANCES: Yes , Mama .
LILLIAN: I do n't want you drinking , Frances .
FRANCES: Yes , Mama .
ERNEST: I do n't know , honey . Your mother has such big plans for you .
FRANCES: I know that , Dad , but
ERNEST: What you have to understand , Francie , is that she well she wanted so much for herself too , and for me , and she never really got to The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers but she could have been if times were different she could have been a politician or I do n't know .
FRANCES: But Dad , I 'm asking about me . What do you think I should do ?
ERNEST: Well , Francie , sometimes after you get your hands on something you want , it just does n't look the same . Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it 's all you 've got or just let it go . This is the way of things , but I guess you already know that .
FRANCES: Dad whatever I decide , will it be okay with you ?
ERNEST: Always . Always .
FRANCES: I do n't care , Dad . I love you .
ERNEST: I love you too , Francie .
LILLIAN: Oh Frances , do I have news for you ! Guess who
FRANCES: Wait , Mama , wait . I have something to tell you . I 've decided well I 'm not going to make movies anymore . I thought that 's what I wanted , and I went after it with all my soul , the way you taught me , but I was miserable , Mama , and it nearly killed me . So now now it 's over . I want a different kind of life , something simple . I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful in the country maybe , and I 'll have dogs and cats I feel so light suddenly , so clea for the first time in It 's going to be okay , Mama , I know it . And I love you .
LILLIAN: Do n't talk crazy .
FRANCES: Mama ?
LILLIAN: They want you back ! Your agent called today ! Do n't you understand ? He 's sending the scripts . He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people ! Frances , you ca n't do this to your fans ! Why , they 've been praying for you all through this nightmare . You ca n't turn your back on them now ! Look at this fan mail I 've been answering !
FRANCES: Have n't you heard what I said ?
LILLIAN: I told him to come up ! I told him you wanted to show them all that there 's nothing wrong with you any more , that you 're completely cured !
FRANCES: I 'm not cured . I was never sick ! They had no business putting me in there ! My only responsibility is to myself now !
LILLIAN: You you selfish , selfish child . At least talk to him , hear what he has to say .
FRANCES: No !
LILLIAN: You want to throw it all away , is that it ? You had everything , little sister . Beauty a brilliant career a wonderful husband . You were a movie star !
FRANCES: Mama , shut up !
LILLIAN: And now you 're throwing everything away ? You 're gon na be a nobody ! Nobody ! You know what that 's like ? !
FRANCES: You You 'd send me back , would n't you ? You would . Frances grabs her coat .
LILLIAN: Where are you going ?
FRANCES: I 'm going out !
LILLIAN: You 're not going anywhere !
FRANCES: Yes , I am , and you ca n't stop me ! You ca n't tell me what to do , mother . I 'm a grown woman , and I can decide about my own life .
LILLIAN: Frances !
FRANCES: Do n't you try and stop me . Do n't you dare !
LILLIAN: That 's it . You 've done it now , little sister .
DR. DOYLE: Yes , yes , Mrs. Farmer
ALMA STYLES: Frances has always been a attleground , Lillian .
DOYLE: The point is it 's your opinion that Frances is getting steadily worse ?
LILLIAN: Well yes .
DOYLE: And you feel you 're unable to control her any longer ?
LILLIAN: No I mean , yes , Doctor .
DOYLE: And the only course open to you is to commit your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution ?
LILLIAN: Well , Alma told me that Alma looks coolly at Lillian .
DOYLE: I believe that 's all I need to know about Miss Farmer .
HILLIER: I think in all future documents she should be referred to as Mrs. R. H. Richardson .
LILLIAN: Her married name ?
HILLIER: Yes . It 's less recognizable . I 'm sure you 'd prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum .
LILLIAN: Oh yes .
HILLIER: Now . Can you tell us where we might find Frances ?
FRANCES: Looking for a drink , and the town is deserted , he ca n't understand it . Finally he finds a bar , goes in the place is empty , bartender 's closing up . Salesman says , ' Gim me a martini . ' Bartender 's real nervous , he says , 'No , no , no , I got ta close . Big Otis is coming to town . '
DOYLE: From her history , it 's apparent the patient suffers from a paranoid eaction with pronounced egotism . Her violent responses have recently included aggression against he mother . In view of the deep-seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond satisfactorily to insulin shock , it is my opinion she may ultimately require permanent institutional care .
HILLIER: Counsellor , as Guardian ad litem fo Mrs. Richardson , do you waive jury trial ?
STYLES: Yes , your Honor . She signs a paper which is passed to Hillier .
HILLIER: Having heard the testimony of a legally qualified and reputable physician and being furthe satisfied of the truth of all matters set forth in the certificates of said physician , I do hereby orde that the said Mrs. R. H. Richardson , an insane person , be confined to the Western State Hospital for the Insane at Steilacoom . He bangs his gavel .
DOCTOR #1: What 's she getting , anyway ?
DOCTOR #2: Standard series to start .
DOCTOR #1: Fifteen ?
STUDENT: Can I push the button on this one ? Doctor # 1 shoots a silent query to Doctor # 2 .
DOCTOR #2: Sure .
FRANCES: Doctor , it may sound odd , but I elieve I 've profited from my stay here . It 's just what I 've needed , to get away like this . But I 'm ecuperated now . I 've had lots of time to think and I 've made a few decisions about my life . I 'm ready to get on with it .
DOYLE: I know you believe that .
FRANCES: Do n't you ?
DOYLE: I 'm afraid not . You see , we observe things that you 're unaware of signs , indicators . Your problem cuts very deep , Frances , and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out , you 'll really feel secure . Does that make sense ? The Attendants lower her into the empty tub .
FRANCES: No . Cut this runaround , Doctor . I know better .
DOYLE: Listen to yourself , Frances . The esistance , the anger in your voice .
FRANCES: You I 'm sorry , forgive me . Doctor , tell me honestly , what do I have to do to get out of here ?
DOYLE: Be patient , that 's all . Take an interest in your treatment and do n't dwell on your resentments . You 'll be yourself again , I assure you .
FRANCES: I see .
DOYLE: We 'll talk more about this . I 'll see you later .
FRANCES: One question . If I 'm not myself now , just who do you think I am ? The Doctor smiles sympathetically .
DOYLE: We 'll talk .
FRANCES: What the hell !
CHANT: Come and get it ! Come and get it ! Come and get it !
FRANCES: Come and get it
HARRY: Frances ! Frances !
FRANCES: Who ?
HARRY: Frances , it 's me , Harry ?
FRANCES: Touch me again and I 'll kill you , you pig .
DOCTOR: Watch out , Harry . Let me look he over . Harry is on the verge of tears .
HARRY: Oh , God ! Let 's get her out of here tonight , right now ! Let 's take he with us !
DOCTOR: The hearing 's tomorrow . If she gets out legally , they ca n't come afte her .
HARRY: Look at her ! She 'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow
DOCTOR: I 'm taking care of that , Harry . Just hold her . Reserpine . I guarantee you this 'll clear her head . She 'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing .
HARRY: You 'll be okay , honey . He 's just givin ' you something to make you think , so that tomorrow you can tell 'em what they want to hear , okay ? Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and you 're grateful .
DOCTOR: This stuff takes pretty quick . Let 's go .
FRANCES: Please ! Take me !
DOCTOR: Let 's get out of here ! I 'll lose my job !
HARRY: Frances , we got ta do it this way . Just remember tomorrow , remembe what I told you . What 're you gon na tell 'em ?
FRANCES: I 'm grateful grateful .
DOCTOR: Harry !
HARRY: I got ta go now .
FRANCES: Harry , please !
DOCTOR: We 're all square now , Harry . Right ?
HARRY: All square , Doc .
DOCTOR: Good . 'Cause I do n't want to see you again .
FRANCES: I love you , Harry . I love you .
HARRY: I love you too , Frances .
FRANCES: I realize now that I was a very sick woman .
ONE PATIENT: She 's not normal !
FRANCES: And I was not taking responsibility for my actions . But now , thanks to your treatment , I feel ready to face myself , ready to resume the caree which I so single-handedly shattered . I only hope I hope I can make you all proud of me . Thank you . Thank you so much .
LILLIAN: Of course , she has n't anything definite in mind .
FRANCES: No . No , it all depends on what offers I get .
REPORTER: Who did your hair , Frances ?
FRANCES: Well , I like to try different styles . Sometimes if you 're old-fashioned enough , you find you 're modern . Right , Mama ? Lillian laughs .
REPORTER: What do you think of all this , Mrs. Farmer ?
LILLIAN: It 's a miracle . Just a miracle .
FRANCES: No , Mama , I 'll take care of it . I 'll wash them in the morning . Lillian smiles warmly at her .
LILLIAN: You know , little sister , I neve esented you for refusing to see me in the the hospital . I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back .
FRANCES: Thank you for understanding , Mama .
LILLIAN: Little sister , I do n't want you to feel any rush to get back to work . I want you to rest for a while anyway .
FRANCES: I will , I promise . They hug each other .
LILLIAN: Good night , dear .
HARRY: Where to ?
FRANCES: Oh Harry She approaches him tentatively .
HARRY: This is it , kid . This is our chance . When you got a chance , you bette take it .
FRANCES: Yeah . I do n't know .
HARRY: You do n't need to screw around anymore . You do n't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother . You need me .
FRANCES: I know , but There were so many people in there , Harry . Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me watching , looking ove my shoulder , touching me , grabbing , sticking things into me . When I feel somebody near me now anybody my skin starts to crawl . Long beat . She turns and stares at him sadly .
HARRY: Been a lot of years , you know . A long time waiting . For what ? End up feeling like a sap .
FRANCES: Oh please , Harry do n't even think it . You 're the only person who ever It 's just Ca n't you wait for me ?
HARRY: I do n't know .
FRANCES: Yes you do . If you love me you can wait , right ? A month , six months , whatever it takes .

HARRY: I 'll be seeing you , kid . He turns and walks slowly to his car .
HITCHHIKER: Pretty morning .
FRANCES: It 's always beautiful at this time . Peaceful
HITCHHIKER: And no people .
FRANCES: Yes . Beat .
HITCHHIKER: Where you goin ' ?
FRANCES: Wherever they 're going , I 'm going .

FRANCES: Dad ? Why do n't you stop at a side oad and let me out ? Ernest writhes slightly with discomfort .
ERNEST: Francie , you know I ca n't do that .
FRANCES: Why ? It 's such a simple thing . You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again .
ERNEST: They 'll just catch you again , Francie . Besides , your mother will know . We SEE them approaching a side road .
FRANCES: Dad , here ! You do n't have to stop , just slow down . You can tell Mama I jumped out . She knows that 's the kind of thing I 'd do . She wo n't blame you .
ERNEST: But I gave her my word . Besides , she 's still your legal guardian . My hands are tied . They are nearer the side road .

FRANCES: You were hoping for a kind word ? ! You 're my mother ! You 're supposed to nourish me ! Support me !
LILLIAN: I have !

SOLDIER #1: Best deal I ever made . Twenty ucks to fuck a fuckin ' movie star .
SOLDIER #2: Yeah , it 's worth it I guess .
SOLDIER #1: What 's she saying , anyway ?
SOLDIER #2: Who knows . She 's crazy , ai n't she ?
OLDER NURSE: I do n't know why they even bother . She 's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant .
YOUNG NURSE: Yeah ?
OLDER NURSE: I checked the files . This one holds the record for shock treatments . Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight .
YOUNG NURSE: You 're kidding .
OLDER NURSE: Yeah , well , you know doctors . They sure hate to use that word .
YOUNG NURSE: What ?
OLDER NURSE: 'Incurable . '
FRANCES: Harry ? Oh Harry , I knew you 'd come . I love you , Harry . I love Take me home , Harry .
DOYLE: We 'll get you home , Frances .
FRANCES: Thank you , Harry .
DR. HARLINGTON: We have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective , ut until now it could n't be applied on a large scale . The old procedure equired a full day 's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation . In the same time , working alone , I can treat fifty .
LILLIAN: What was I saying ? Oh yes , it was the Communists that did it to Frances .
REPORTER: Uh excuse us , Mrs. Farmer . We 're going to have to uh
THIRD REPORTER: Yeah , I better pack it in too .
LILLIAN: Pardon ? Oh , would you like more lemonade ? The last Reporter gets to his feet .
FOURTH REPORTER: I think we 've had enough . Thank you , Mrs. Farmer . Goodbye .
LILLIAN: You know , Ernie , I think we should have Frances ' room repainted fo when she comes home . That 'll brighten her day .
EDWARDS: Dwayne Steele divorced you , and from this point on , your story takes a darker turn . Shunned by the Hollywood you criticized so harshly , alienated from your family and friends , you turn your back on professional commitments in New York , and alcohol and drugs enter you life . These are sad , desperate times for you .
FRANCES: No , Ralph . I do n't believe I eve was sick . But when you 're treated like a patient long enough , you 're apt to act like one
EDWARDS: and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight so who knows , Frances Farmer , anything 's possible on you comeback trail ! And since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere , look what we 've got for you !
FRANCES: Thank you , Ralph .
EDWARDS: Thank you , Frances . And after the show we 're hosting a reception fo you and your friends at Hollywood 's own Roosevelt Hotel ! Applause .
WOMAN: Where shall we drop you , Frances ? Home ?
FRANCES: No no , someone 's picking me up .
HARRY: C'mere . I want to talk to you .
FRANCES: Oh . Why , Harry York . How nice to see you . Harry is a little puzzled by her reaction .
HARRY: How how ya doin ' , Farmer ?
FRANCES: Fine , thank you . Did you watch the show ?
HARRY: Sure I did , that 's why I 'm here .
FRANCES: How did I look ?
HARRY: Oh , you ennh .
FRANCES: Well you 're looking well . They are both silent a long moment .
HARRY: Yeah . Yeah , I heard about that .
FRANCES: Dad , too . I sold the house . I 'm a faceless sinner , Harry
HARRY: Why do you say that ?
FRANCES: I 'd ask you to take me home , but I 'm a faceless sinner . You smell good , Harry . Familiar , you know ? I 'd ask you to take me home , but Harry is alarmed now .
HARRY: Frances !
FRANCES: Do n't get mad at me , Harry . Please . It 's just Some things happen fo the best . Beat . She takes his hand as if to shake it . Harry clasps hers tenderly .
HARRY: I 'm not sure .
FRANCES: Very slow . But we 're not going to stop , are we ?
HARRY: No .
FRANCES: No , we 're not .
HARRY: Yes . Would you like me to walk a little way with you ?
FRANCES: That would be okay .
HARRY: Just a little way .
GRIGORI: It 's going to ram us .
WALTON: It would n't dare .
WALTON: Put your backs into it !
SAILOR #1: What 's the use ? This godless ice stretches for miles ! Would you have us chow our way back to England ?
WALTON: No . But we 'll chop our way to the North Pole if we have to . Inch by loody inch .
GRIGORI: You ca n't mean to go on ! Our journey is ended ! The best we can hope fo now is to get out of this alive !
SAILOR #2: Aye , if the ice ever lets us !
WALTON: The ice will break . And when it does , we proceed north as planned .
GRIGORI: At the cost of how many more lives ?
WALTON: You five come with me ! The rest stay with the ship !
GRIGORI: Look .
WALTON: Back to the ship .
OLD SAILOR: Only the ice to starboard , boy .
YOUNG SAILOR: Is it breaking up ?
OLD SAILOR: Just dancing on the current . It 'll freeze even tighter come next wind . CAMERA DRIFTS past to another group
SAILOR #4: It was a polar bear . That 's what I say .
SAILOR #5: Say all you want , but you were n't there . It left human tracks .
SAILOR #6: No man could tear those dogs apart .
SAILOR #5: No human . We 've roused a demon from the ice .
SAILOR: Something . In the mist .
YOUNG SAILOR: It 's the demon ! Shoot while you 've a chance !
WALTON: Dead ?
GRIGORI: Captain , I implore you . The men are frightened and angry . They want you assurance .
WALTON: They knew the risks when they signed on . I 've come too far to turn back now .
GRIGORI: Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny .
WALTON: Let them try .
VICTOR: I 'm dying .
WALTON: Are you a physician ?
VICTOR: How is it you come to be here ?
WALTON: There 's a startling question , coming from you . I 'm captain of this ship . We sailed from Archangel a month ago , seeking a passage to the North Pole .
VICTOR: Ah . An explorer .
WALTON: Would-be . I 'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment .
VICTOR: I heard .
WALTON: I ca n't say I blame them . We 're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of creature .
VICTOR: Creature ? A human like creature ?
WALTON: You know of it ?
VICTOR: Your men are right to be afraid .
WALTON: Then explain it , whatever it is . It could save the voyage . I 've spent years planning this . My entire fortune .
VICTOR: You 'd persist at the cost of you own life ? The lives of your crew ?
WALTON: Lives are ephemeral . The knowledge we gain , the achievements we leave ehind those live on .
VICTOR: Do you share my madness ?
WALTON: Madness ? CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY on Victor 's face
VICTOR: We are kindred , you and I . Men of ambition . Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits . I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man .
WALTON: Who are you ?
VICTOR: My name is Frankenstein
FATHER: Mrs. Moritz , would you and you daughter excuse us ?
MRS. MORITZ: Of course , Doctor . Madam . Come along , Justine . Bring your dolly .
MOTHER: Victor . This is Elizabeth . She 's coming to live with us .
FATHER: She has lost her parents to scarlet fever . She is an orphan .
MOTHER: You must think of her as your own sister . You must look after her . And e kind to her .
VICTOR: Do n't cry , Elizabeth .
ELIZABETH: Are n't you ?
VICTOR: We 'll build a fort . So the lightning ca n't get us .
ELIZABETH: Are you sure it ca n't hurt us ?
VICTOR: Nothing can . Not ever .
MRS. MORITZ: You must lead , Victor . The lady will always look to you for guidance , so your steps must be sure and strong
VICTOR: Mrs. Moritz .
MRS. MORITZ: aaand , one-two-three , one-two- three , twirl-two-three
JUSTINE: Mama , can I dance with Victor ?
MRS. MORITZ: Nonsense , Justine . Hush . And now a sweeping arc about the room ! one- two-three , twirl-two-three .
JUSTINE: Yes , Mama .
ELIZABETH: She 'll be all right .
MRS. MORITZ: You can do nothing here . Wait downstairs .
VICTOR: Mother ?
FATHER: Victor , do as you 're told !
VICTOR: As a boy , I stood at this window and watched God destroy our tree .
ELIZABETH: Oh God . The blood .
FATHER: I did everything I could .
VICTOR: How could all my father 's knowledge and skill fail to save her ?
ELIZABETH: It 's not ours to decide . All that live must die . It 's God 's will .
VICTOR: What kind of God is He to will this ?
ELIZABETH: She was mother to me as well . But ours is the job of the living . It 's up to us now to hold this family together . We must think of Fathe and be strong for him . I can not do that alone .
VICTOR: God took her from us .
ELIZABETH: He left a beautiful gift in her place . A baby boy . To cherish and love as our very own . Your brothe
VICTOR: Our brother .
JUSTINE: Poor William ! What indignant tears !
ELIZABETH: There , there shhh
VICTOR: The world is a dizzying place .
ELIZABETH: Oh , do give him here ! He needs to be comforted and held !
VICTOR: He needs to vent his outrage to the skies ! Make yourself heard , Willie ! Learning to walk is not an easy thing ! Why should it be so ?
ELIZABETH: That 's the nature of all progress , William . Do n't let your brother sway you otherwise .
JUSTINE: Quite right !
VICTOR: Do n't listen , Willie . Progress is a feast to be consumed . Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run . Or run before you can waltz !
ELIZABETH: Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel !
VICTOR: Devil take walking , ladies ! My brothe shall learn to waltz !
JUSTINE: Elizabeth , really ! He 's quite mad !
ELIZABETH: Scandalous ! What would your dea mother say ?
JUSTINE: One-two-three , one-two-three , twirl- two-three
WILLIE: Auntie Justine , Papa said I could have a sweet .
JUSTINE: You can . But not before dinner .
ELIZABETH: And you look so lovely .
JUSTINE: Victor ? Spare me one dance ? Elizabeth catches Victor 's eye .
ELIZABETH: Go on , ask her . Please . I 'm quite out of breath .
FATHER: My friends , fatherly pride wo n't allow this occasion to pass without my raising a toast .
VICTOR: But never your equal .
FATHER: No . You 'll surpass me .
ELIZABETH: Smell the air . Wonderful .
VICTOR: Quite a send-off , is n't it ?
ELIZABETH: Father 's so proud .
VICTOR: And you ?
ELIZABETH: Prouder still . You 'll be the handsomest student there .
VICTOR: I 'll have to do better than that .
ELIZABETH: You will . What do you want , Victor ?
VICTOR: To be the best there ever was . To push our knowledge beyond ou dreams to eradicate disease and pestilence to purge mankind of ignorance and fear He 's so serious , she ca n't help laugh .
ELIZABETH: No . Just very earnest . And very dear .
VICTOR: I 've loved you all my life
ELIZABETH: All my life I 've known . They kiss again . A breath . A shiver .
VICTOR: This feels incestuous .
ELIZABETH: Is that what makes it so delicious ?
VICTOR: I wish to be your husband .
ELIZABETH: I wish to be your wife .
VICTOR: Then come with me to Ingolstadt . Marry me now .
ELIZABETH: If only I could . But one of us must stay . Father 's not strong . Willie 's just a child . Who can look afte them in your absence ? Who can run the estate ?
VICTOR: Only you .
ELIZABETH: I will be here when you return .
VICTOR: You make me weak .
ELIZABETH: Not as weak as I .
VICTOR: Your decision . For us .
ELIZABETH: I give you my soul
VICTOR: until our wedding night . When ou odies will join .
ELIZABETH: Victor . I love you ,
VICTOR: Elizabeth . My more than sister . They kiss again . Gently
FATHER: Write to us often . Victor moves on to Justine , takes her hand .
VICTOR: We never finished our dance . Someday we shall .
FRAU BRACH: No real rooms left . All we 've got is attic space . No one ever wants the attic space
VICTOR: This will do nicely .
KREMPE: In science , the letter of fact is the letter of law . Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept . Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect . Someday you may be priests but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse . Any questions ?
VICTOR: But surely , Professor , you do n't intend we disregard the more philosophical works .
KREMPE: Philosophical ?
VICTOR: Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect . Paracelsus , for one .
KREMPE: Paracelsus ?
VICTOR: Or Albertus Magnus . Cornelius Agrippa
KREMPE: What is your name ?
VICTOR: Victor Frankenstein , sir . Of geneva .
KREMPE: Of Geneva . Tell me , Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva . Do you wish to study medicine ? O mysticism ?
HENRY: I was just clearing my throat .
VICTOR: Very well then .
HENRY: You know , you 're quite mad . Victor stops . Turns .
VICTOR: I am not mad .
HENRY: As a march hare .
VICTOR: Are you having me on ?
HENRY: Of course I am . It pays to humor the insane .
VICTOR: Victor , Victor Frankenstein .
HENRY: I know . You have a way of making an impression .
VICTOR: Do you really think I 'm mad ?
HENRY: Come now . Magnus ? Agrippa ? Next thing you know , you 'll be teaching toadstools to speak .
SCHILLER: If it is n't the sorcerer . Found yourself an apprentice ?
VICTOR: I 'm afraid I rejected his application . He merely dabbles .
HENRY: Dilettantes need not apply . What about you ? Schiller , is n't it ?
SCHILLER: Von Schiller . I 'm interested in real medicine . Treating the sick .
HENRY: Really ? I myself find sick people ather revolting . I 'm here to secure my degree with a minimum of fuss and hard work that I might settle into a life of privilege treating rich old ladies with gout and dallying with their daughters .
SCHILLER: You two disgust me . Schiller and his friends stalk off .
VICTOR: Rich old ladies and their daughters ?
HENRY: Can you think of a better reason ?
VICTOR: Quite a few .
HENRY: Do me a favor then keep them to yourself .
CLAUDE: It 's turning out to be a good year .
ELIZABETH: Let 's return a tenth of the crop to the tenants . They had a hard winter .
CLAUDE: Not even your father would be that generous .
ELIZABETH: Then there 's no need to tell him , is there ?
STABLEBOY: Miss ! The mail arrived ! There 's one from Master Victor !
ELIZABETH: and not a day goes by that I do not cherish your faces in my mind 's eye or ache to see you all again . Be assured that I am with you in spirit , and you are never far from my thoughts . I remain , as always , you loving and devoted Victor . P.S . She pauses , reading ahead .
WILLIE: What does it say ?
ELIZABETH: It says , give Willie an extra big hug for me .
WILLIAM: Read it again ? She smiles , rearranges the pages as we
KREMPE: I 'll see you thrown out of this university ! I 'll go to the dean himself ! Take me at my word , Frankenstein ! The dean himself !
HENRY: The entire school heard it . It was n't something one could miss .
VICTOR: You 're a comfort to me , Henry .
HENRY: What now ? Writing about it in you journal wo n't help .
VICTOR: It 's a letter to my father .
WALDMAN: Victor , explain yourself .
VICTOR: Krempe has a way of provoking my temper .
WALDMAN: You have a way of provoking his . I 've been watching you . You seem impatient with your studies .
VICTOR: To say the least . I came here to expand my mind , but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn . All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new .
WALDMAN: You disdain accepted wisdom ?
VICTOR: No , I embrace it as something to e used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known .
HENRY: Now you 've got him started .
VICTOR: These are exciting times , Henry . We 're entering an era of amazing eakthroughs . Look at Edward Jenner . He was n't content to bleed people with leeches , he pioneered a new frontier of thought
HENRY: yes , and thanks to him , smallpox has been virtually eliminated . I 've heard this speech before .
VICTOR: But you have n't listened , Never in history has so much seemed possible . We 're on the verge of answers undreamt of but only if we have the courage to ask the questions .
WALDMAN: I understand your frustration . I was young once myself . Walk me home . Something I 'd like to show you .
VICTOR: Preposterous .
WALDMAN: I once saw it done , as a boy in Canton . My parents were missionaries . The cure was nothing short of miraculous . I 've never forgotten it . Been fascinated ever since .
HENRY: It smacks of magic .
WALDMAN: Magic . Seems alive , does n't it ?
VICTOR: It 's utterly fantastic ! This is the sort of thing I 'm talking about ! We should be learning this !
WALDMAN: Why ? God alone knows what it means . Until it has proven value , it 's nothing more than a ghoulish parlo trick . Hardly fit for the classroom .
VICTOR: But the possibilities . Combining ancient knowledge with new ? Something like this could change our fundamental views !
WALDMAN: It is a thrilling direction to explore . Thrilling and dangerous . Nature can be wonderful and terrible . Science is not a realm for the eckless ; it needs a conscience . We must proceed cautiously . Assess as we go . What I do on my own time is my own usiness . The same holds true fo you . You wish to expand your mind ? Fine , do so . You can even join me here , if you like . But not at the expense of your normal studies .
VICTOR: I doubt that decision is still mine to make .
WALDMAN: Nonsense . Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe
VICTOR: Why ?
WALDMAN: Our profession needs talent like yours . Destroy your career over an issue of pride ? What a waste .
VICTOR: and I further wish to extend my sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe for my display . My behavior toward him was both rash and inexcusable .
JUSTINE: Must 've been a terrible row .
ELIZABETH: He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a `` pompous Fellow ''
FATHER: He always was opinionated .
ELIZABETH: He set things right with a prope apology and now they 've put him in charge of dissection lab !
WILLIE: What 's that ?
FATHER: That 's where they cut things open and peer about inside .
WILLIE: Things ? What sort of things ?
ELIZABETH: It 's far too ghoulish for your young ears .
WALDMAN: Re-configure the leads ?
VICTOR: Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system ? Waldman nods .
WALDMAN: Worth a try .
VICTOR: and the medulla oblongata is the transition between the spinal cord and the two parts I 've already named cerebrum and cerebellum . Any freshmen feeling queasy yet ? All of you , from the look of it . We 'll resume your torture tomorrow .
KREMPE: You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum .
VICTOR: Despite the lack of challenge .
WALDMAN: Victor . He was trying to be gracious .
VICTOR: The strain was evident .
HENRY: Come now , you must take some satisfaction . You 've risen to the top of your class . A position of prominence and regard .
VICTOR: What keeps me going are my friends .
HENRY: Leave off !
WALDMAN: I 'm quite serious . Look at all the charity and clinic work we do . Up until thirty years ago , the concept of vaccine was unheard of .
HENRY: You 're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated ?
WALDMAN: I 'm convinced . Not by treating symptoms , but by diving nature 's most jealously-guarded secrets .
HENRY: Do you foresee this happening in ou lifetimes ?
WALDMAN: No . But someday .
HENRY: Thank goodness . We 'd be out of work .
VICTOR: Only you would think of that !
HENRY: Somebody has to !
VICTOR: I tell you what we need , my friends . Forget the symptoms and diseases . What we need is a vaccine for death itself .
WALDMAN: Oh , now you have gone too far . There 's only one God , Victor .
HENRY: And here 's to Him . Everything in moderation , Frankenstein .
VICTOR: Nothing in moderation , Clerval .
MAN: Yer not stickin ' it in me ! Got pox in it , I hear tell !
FAT WOMAN: Pox ? They givin ' us pox ?
WALDMAN: No , it 's not pox , it 's a vaccine
FAT WOMAN: Vaca-what ?
WALDMAN: vaccine , from the Latin vacca , meaning cow or vaccinia , meaning cowpox
MAN: I told you there was pox in it !
WALDMAN: no , no , cowpox in a minute quantity , perfectly harmless , gives you a natural immunity to small ox , which is the point of this whole loody exercise
MAN: You doctors kill people ! I don ' care what you say , you ai n't stickin ' it in me !
WALDMAN: I most assuredly am ! It prevents disease and it 's the law ! Why am I explaining myself ? Somebody restrain this damn fool !
HENRY: Professor ?
WALDMAN: Oh God .
HENRY: They just caught the man who did it .
VICTOR: He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance .
HENRY: They 'll hang him all the same .
VICTOR: Good . I 'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap .
HENRY: Keep your voice down . You do n't know what you 're saying .
VICTOR: It was wrong , Henry ! It should n't have happened ! The bastard deserves to die .
HENRY: You 're making a scene !
VICTOR: Why Waldman ? He of all people should have cheated death !
HENRY: You ca n't . Death is God 's will !
VICTOR: I resent God 's monopoly .
HENRY: That 's blasphemy !
VICTOR: Blasphemy be damned ! Waldman spent his life trying to help people !
HENRY: All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor !
VICTOR: No . He had more important work .
HENRY: There are sick people who need ou help . Here and now . Not in some future time . Consider that .
VICTOR: Life and death . Why should You alone have the final say ?
MAGISTRATE: his body to be left on public display for a twenty-four hour period , thereafter to be consigned to an unmarked pauper 's grave . So the court has spoken .
VICTOR: No longer pathetic and useless
HENRY: Victor . This has got to stop . Nobody 's seen you in months . You have n't attended a single class .
VICTOR: I 've been preoccupied .
HENRY: We all know how hard you took Waldman 's death . Even Krempe is sympathetic . But it is time to move on . It is time to concern yourself with life .
VICTOR: That is my concern . I 'm involved in something just now . I want to finish it in Waldman 's memory .
HENRY: How much longer ?
VICTOR: Few months perhaps . I 'm gathering the raw materials even now .
ELIZABETH: Nothing . Still nothing .
JUSTINE: It 's been months . It 's not like him .
ELIZABETH: Something 's wrong . I know it . I 've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg .
JUSTINE: So have I
ELIZABETH: I should go . I should leave today .
JUSTINE: Elizabeth . If it 's true , travel into Germany would be banned . You 'd neve get near Ingolstadt . Besides , they 're only rumors .
ELIZABETH: And not a word of them to Father . He 's agitated enough not hearing from Victor .
JUSTINE: Read him one of the old letters and ephrase it . We 'll say it came today . It 'll set his mind at ease .
VICTOR: That one .
MAN: With this cholera come to town , we 'll have plenty more for you .
VICTOR: Not optimal . Must use . No time to eplace . Body ca n't wait .
HENRY: God 's sake , what is that stench ? Henry peers past him . Victor shifts , blocking his view
VICTOR: This is a bad time , Henry . I 'm busy just now . What do you want ?
HENRY: Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak . Thousand new cases a day now . Classes have been suspended . University 's shut down .
VICTOR: Yes ? And ?
HENRY: Listen to what I 'm saying . The militia 's arriving to quarantine the city . Most of us are getting out while we still can .
VICTOR: You 'll be leaving then . Just as well . You never were cut out for this , Henry . Goodbye .
SCHILLER: To hell with them . And you .
VICTOR: Time running out . Rate of decay accelerating . Must strike now o start again from scratch .
ROUGH MAN: Stupid bastard !
WORKER #1: Over here !
WORKER #2: Oh my God .
HENRY: Victor !
KREMPE: Do n't dawdle , lad ! The sick cart ! Lift on three ! One , two , three !
VICTOR: No no I 'm not dead please Do n't put me on the cart ! I 'm not dead ! I 'm not dead ! I 'M NOT DEAD !
MARIE: Bring Grandfather to the table .
HENRY: Thank God your fever broke . Slowly , now . Just a sip . I 've been worried we might lose you . It 's been touch-and-go for a week .
VICTOR: A week ?
HENRY: We feared cholera . Turned out to be pneumonia , brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm .
VICTOR: Is that your diagnosis ?
HENRY: Mine and Professor Krempe 's . We 've been trading off nursing you in shifts . The rest of the time we 're out working with the cholera victims . It 's his turn for that just now .
VICTOR: You 've been going round-the-clock ?
HENRY: We catch a few hours sleep where we can . Usually here at your bedside .
VICTOR: Everything in moderation , Clerval .
HENRY: Nothing in moderation , Frankenstein . Victor takes Henry 's hand . Squeezes it .
VICTOR: No . They do n't .
HENRY: Victor . This place looked like a charnel house . What went on here ?
VICTOR: I want to go home . Beat .
HENRY: It 'll be months before you 're well enough . Meantime , your family must e frantic not hearing from you .
VICTOR: It ca n't survive .
FELIX: Not much to look at . Even less to eat . I do n't how we 're going to get through the winter with this yield .
MARIE: We 'll sell another pig at market .
FELIX: One less for us .
MARIE: We 'll make do . We always have .
FELIX: I 'll see if I can scratch a few more out of the ground .
GRANDFATHER: I wish we could thank our benefactor .
FELIX: Nothing in this life comes free of cost . I 'd like to know who and why .
MAGGIE: It 's the Good Spirit of the forest .
FELIX: Who 's been filling your head ?
GRANDFATHER: It does no harm .
FELIX: Oh , I see .
THOMAS: Is it , Papa ? Is it the Good Spirit ?
MARIE: Of course it is . Now finish you food before it gets cold .
GRANDFATHER: Who 's there ? Felix ? Children ?
MAGGIE: ff..reh..nn..nd . Friend ? Friend .

FELIX: What is going on here ?
VICTOR: `` but it 's been so long since I 've heard from you . Remember the vow we took the night you left ? You must be honest with me if your feelings have changed . Answer for the sake of ou friendship , and both our future happiness . '' She wrote that four months ago .
HENRY: A woman like that is far too rare to e taken lightly .
THOMAS: Chuur-ch . Church .
CREATURE: Chuuuch .
MARIE: Good . And the next .
THOMAS: Floww .
CREATURE: Floww
THOMAS: wer . Flower ?
MARIE: Very good ! Maggie . Try the next . Now the Creature beats Maggie to the punch
CREATURE: Garrrdenn . Garden .

GRANDFATHER: Let them play . There 's plenty of wood for the fire .
FELIX: He 's right about that .
CREATURE: It 's snnowwinng .
MAGGIE: That one ! It 's the most beautiful tree I 've ever seen !
CREATURE: Most beautiful tree
MAGGIE: Merry Christmas !
CREATURE: For the Goood Spirr-rit of the Forr-rest .
MARIE: with particles of heavenly fire , the God of Nature did his soul inspire and pliant still the ethereal energy which wise Prometheus tempered into paste
CREATURE: Myyy Darrllnng Victor Willee haaad hisss burrth-dayyy . I wissh yooo cuud huvv beeen herre to sharre ut withh ussss

FELIX: God in heaven .
GRANDFATHER: Would you like to sit by the fire ?
CREATURE: Nice .
GRANDFATHER: The music ? Or the fire ?
CREATURE: Better that way for me .
GRANDFATHER: Why ?
CREATURE: I 'm very , very ugly . People are afraid . Except you .
GRANDFATHER: It ca n't be as bad as that .
CREATURE: Worse .
GRANDFATHER: I can see you with my hands . If you 'll trust me .
CREATURE: Yes . I have been seeking my friends .
GRANDFATHER: Friends ? Do they live around here ?
CREATURE: Yes . Very close
GRANDFATHER: Why do you not go to them ?
CREATURE: I have been afraid . Afraid they will hate me because I am so very ugly and they are so very eautiful
GRANDFATHER: People can be kinder than you think .

GRANDFATHER: Perhaps I can help . Tell me who .
CREATURE: I love them so very much . I want I want them to be my ff-family . I II-Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm- mmuch
GRANDFATHER: Leave him alone !

HENRY: Our carriage is here .
MRS. KREMPE: Such a terrible winter . I 'll praise God to see those gates open again .
KREMPE: I 'll have all your things sent on . They should arrive soon after . It 's been a rough time , lad . For us all . But if you 'd like to come back and finish out your final term once university re-opens
VICTOR: Thank you , Professor . For everything .
KREMPE: Write and let us know you 've arrived safely .
VICTOR: Take me home , my friend .
WILLIAM: HE 'S COMING HOME !
FATHER: What 's all the fuss ? Why are you shouting ?
WILLIAM: He 's coming home ! Tonight !
ELIZABETH: Who ? Victor ?
WILLIAM: That 's what I 'm telling you !
ELIZABETH: Thank God .
FATHER: Open it .
WILLIAM: It 's Victor !
JUSTINE: It 's beautiful ! May I ? He looks so handsome .
FATHER: What does it say ?
ELIZABETH: Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left . He 's coming home to marry me .
WILLIAM: Married ! The two of you ?
FATHER: Brilliant ! I knew it ! Ever since you were children !
JUSTINE: That 's wonderful .
WILLIAM: Elizabeth ? Can I take this to show Peter ?
ELIZABETH: Willie , it 's not a toy for you friends .
WILLIAM: I 'll take extra special care , I promise ! Pete 's never seen what Victo looks like ! He 'll admire it enormously !
ELIZABETH: Do n't dawdle . It 'll be dark in a few hours .
FATHER: Join us for champagne ! My son is coming home !
CREATURE: Wait ! Do n't be afraid !
MRS. MORITZ: Justine ! Pay attention !
JUSTINE: Yes , Mother .
ELIZABETH: Are you all right ?
JUSTINE: Fine . Justine sees genuine concern . She softens
FATHER: Have you seen Willie ?
ELIZABETH: Is he not back yet ?
FATHER: Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time . They say he never arrived .
ELIZABETH: It 's far too late for him to still e out .
CLAUDE: Do n't worry , Monsieur , we 'll find him .
ELIZABETH: WILLIE !
JUSTINE: WILLIE !
VICTOR: There ! Look !
HENRY: Quite a place .
VICTOR: Thank you , Henry .
HENRY: For what ?
VICTOR: This . My home . My family . If not for you , I 'd be dead in a urial pit somewhere .
MRS. MORITZ: Sir . I 'm terrified for my girl .
VICTOR: We 'll organize another search now that it 's light enough . We 'll find her , Mrs. Moritz , I promise .
ELIZABETH: What is Father 's outlook ?
HENRY: I am cautiously hopeful . With quiet and proper care he may eventually egain some or most of his strength .
ELIZABETH: Thank you , Henry . There 's a KNOCKING at the front door .
POLICEMAN #1: Mr. Frankenstein . We 've apprehended the murderer . Not five miles from here , hiding in a barn .
VICTOR: Who is it ? The policemen trade uneasy glances .
POLICEMAN #2: It 's very unsettling , sir . And quite strange . Perhaps you 'd better come with us .
FEMALE VOICE: Victor ?
JUSTINE: Victor ! It 's you ! Thank God !
VICTOR: Yes .
JUSTINE: Willie . My poor little angel . Victor ! They think I did it !
VICTOR: Did you ?
JUSTINE: I do n't believe I am in need of your comfort anymore .
VICTOR: Did you , Justine ?
JUSTINE: Get out !
KITCHEN MAID: I found her sobbing her eyes out . Poor thing , I said , what 's all this ? And she spilled her heart to me about Master Victor . How she 'd always loved him , and now he was coming home to marry mistress Elizabeth .
VICTOR: I always viewed her with brotherly affection . I had no idea of he feelings for me .
PROSECUTOR: Rejection can be a powerful wound . People have been known to do uncanny things .
VICTOR: But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved ?
ELIZABETH: Justine and I grew up as sisters . I know her better than anybody .
DEFENDING COUNSEL: Do you think it possible she committed this crime ?
ELIZABETH: William was as much her child as mine . We were both mother to him . I believe she would sooner have strangled the life from her own body .
DEFENDING COUNSEL: Then you consider the charge without merit .
ELIZABETH: I consider the charge imbecilic .
JUSTINE: Yes . I took refuge in the barn . Would n't you ? Lost in the storm ? Freezing and wet ? I was exhausted and could search no longer .
PROSECUTOR: And is it true , Miss Moritz , that you love Victor Frankenstein ? That your heart was broken ? Answer the question . Do you love Victor Frankenstein ?
JUSTINE: I have always loved him .
PROSECUTOR: Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion ?
JUSTINE: Murder Willie ? In my heart , he was our child . Victor 's and mine . Such a thing could never have entered my mind .
PROSECUTOR: So you have claimed . Yet you have no explanation for this . The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder . The locket you so coveted . How did it come to be in you possession ?
JUSTINE: I have no knowledge of that .
CREATURE: Frankenstein .
VICTOR: Oh God . Oh God ! No ! NOOOOOOO !
ELIZABETH: But why risk yourself ? Has n't this family suffered enough ?
VICTOR: I 've no choice
ELIZABETH: If what you say is true , it is a matter for the police !
VICTOR: They 've done a fine job . Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend .
ELIZABETH: Do you know this man ? Is there something between you ?
VICTOR: I know only that he is a killer . And I shall bring back his carcass .
CREATURE: Come warm yourself if you like .
VICTOR: You speak .
CREATURE: Yes , I speak . And read . And think and know the ways of Man . I 've been waiting for you . Two months now .
VICTOR: How did you find me ?
CREATURE: The letters in your journal . That and a geography book . Your Elizabeth sounds lovely .
VICTOR: Kill me and have done with it .
CREATURE: Kill you ? Hardly that .
VICTOR: Then why am I here ? What did you want with me ?
CREATURE: More to the point , why am I here ? What did you want with me ? What does one say to one 's Maker , having finally met him face to face ? Milton gave it voice . Did I request thee , Maker , from my clay to mould me Man ? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me ?
VICTOR: Fine words from a child killer . You who murdered my brother .
CREATURE: Your crime as well as mine .
VICTOR: How dare you . You 're disgusting and evil .
CREATURE: Evil ? Do you believe in evil ?
VICTOR: I see it before me .
CREATURE: I 'm not sure I believe . But then I had no one to instruct me . I had no mother and my father abandoned me at birth .
VICTOR: There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand .
CREATURE: What of my soul ? Do I have one ? O was that a part you left out ? Who were these people of which I am comprised ? Good people ? Bad people ?
VICTOR: Materials . Nothing more .
CREATURE: You 're wrong . Do you know I knew how to play this ?
VICTOR: Trace memories in the brain , perhaps .
CREATURE: Stolen memories . Stolen and hazy . They taunt me in my dreams . I 've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her . Whose woman was this ? I 've seen boys playing , splashing about in a stream . Whose childhood friends were these ? Who am I ?
VICTOR: I do n't know .
CREATURE: Then perhaps I believe in evil afte all .
VICTOR: What can I do ?
CREATURE: There is something I want . A friend .
VICTOR: Friend ?
CREATURE: A companion . A female . Like me , so she wo n't hate me .
VICTOR: Like you ? Oh , God , you do n't know what you 're asking .
CREATURE: I do know that for the sympathy of one living being , I would make peace with all . I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine . And rage the likes of which you would not elieve . If I can not satisfy the one , I will demonically indulge the other . That choice is yours . You 're the one who set this in motion , Frankenstein .
VICTOR: And if I consent ?
CREATURE: We 'd travel north , my bride and I . To the furthest reaches of the Pole , where no man has ever set foot . There we would live out our lives . Together . No human eye would ever see us again . This I vow .
VICTOR: Yes . I want this over and done with .
CREATURE: I 'll be waiting . And watching .
ELIZABETH: I thought I 'd never see you again !
VICTOR: I 'm all right . I 'm safe ,
HENRY: What happened up there ?
VICTOR: I did n't find what I was looking for .
CLAUDE: What did you find ?
VICTOR: At shadows . My nerves got the bette of me .
ELIZABETH: What sort of task ?
VICTOR: It 's not something I can explain now . Perhaps someday .
ELIZABETH: What of our marriage ? Victor , we 've had so much tragedy . I want this family to live again .
VICTOR: So do I .
ELIZABETH: We need each other now , I need you comfort and strength , not separation and solitude .
VICTOR: A month at most , that 's all I ask . Elizabeth , please . Things have not yet resolved . I must take steps to see that they do . For our family 's sake . For our sake . You are life itself . We shall seal our vow . The moment I am done .
HENRY: Whatever they are .

VICTOR: What is this ?
CREATURE: A brain . Extremities .

CREATURE: What does it matter ? She 'll live again . You 'll make her .
VICTOR: No . I draw the line .
CREATURE: You will honor your promise to me !
VICTOR: I will not ! Kill me now !
CREATURE: That is mild compared to what will come . If you deny me my wedding night . I 'll be with you on yours .
VICTOR: No . Not tomorrow , not next week , Marry me today .
ELIZABETH: Why the change ? What about your work ?
VICTOR: It was misguided and pointless . Is your answer yes ?

VICTOR: A year now I 've followed him . Perhaps more . Only to arrive at this place . Tired . So very tired . I never did find whatever it was I was looking for and neither will you , my friend . Value life above ambition or those glittering prizes you seek will crumble to dust in your fingers as they have in mine . See your loved ones again . I can not .
WALTON: Rest now .

WALTON: Yes .
CREATURE: I was watching .
WALTON: What is that to you ? Evil as you are .
CREATURE: I am as he made me . In his own image .
WALTON: You drove him to his torment .
CREATURE: And he drove me to mine .
WALTON: Then why weep for him ?
CREATURE: Would you not ? He was father . And mother . We fell from grace together . He from his God . I from mine .

BURGEMEISTER: Where do you think you 're going ? She freezes .
ELSA: School . He turns to face her .
BURGEMEISTER: Is that so . What about that dog of yours ?
ELSA: She 's not in the house and she 's away from your tulips .

ELSA: Yes sir . He 's finished . Has nothing more to say .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Good morning children . I am Mr. Rzykruski . I will be your new science teacher . Apparently , Mr. Holcum had an incident . Edgar interjects
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Well . That is bad . But he did not get `` hit by '' lightning . Lightning does not hit a person , the way one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage .
TOSHIAKI: But it 's not rare . Lightning happens to people all the time here . There 's a thunderstorm almost every night .
BOB: My dad got hit twice .
WEIRD GIRL: They built New Holland on an abandoned gold mine
TOSHIAKI: I heard it was a cemetery .
WEIRD GIRL: That 's where they buried the miners .
NASSOR: It 's the windmill that does it .
WEIRD GIRL: No . Cemetery . Definitely .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Students on your way out , take a permission slip for the Science Fair . Nassor takes a form . Reads it . They are intrigued but do n't understand .
BOB: First prize is a huge trophy ! January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 10
WEIRD GIRL: Hello , Victor .
VICTOR: Hi .

VICTOR: How do you know ?
WEIRD GIRL: Because this morning , he made this .
VICTOR: Did you get that out of the litte ox ?
WEIRD GIRL: It 's an omen .
VICTOR: You can keep it .
WEIRD GIRL: One day you 'll dream about me , wo n't you kitty ? Mr. Whiskers offers nothing .
VICTOR: Hey boy . How you doing ? Suddenly the backyard gate bursts open .
VICTOR: It says no death rays . See ?
VICTOR: I 'm sorry Edgar . I just do n't need a partner . I like to work alone .
MOM: Dinner 's ready .
DAD: Victor , have I ever talked to you about what I do for a living ?
VICTOR: You 're a travel agent .
DAD: I sell dreams . I tell people , you can sail to Italy . You can do the hula in Hawaii .
VICTOR: Will you sign my form ?
DAD: I 'm getting to that . January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 13
VICTOR: Okay .
DAD: In my job , sometimes you have people who do n't want quite the same thing , right . Say the husband wants to play golf in Scotland , but the wife wants to paddle down the Amazon . Alright you 've got two conflicting ideas here . And it 's my job , Victor , to help them meet halfway . Say , Scottsdale , Arizona . He gets to golf , she gets Indians .
MOM: But there 's no river . And no jungle .
VICTOR: Nobody gets what they want .
DAD: Exactly . And wrong . They both get what they want because they compromise .
GYM TEACHER: Strike three ! Next Batter !
MR. RZYKRUSKI: I want you to concentrate on you project for the science fair .
MOM: Come on honey !
TOSHIAKI: Nice catch Sparky .
DAD: Come on Victor , please . Tie Sparky up and get your head into the game .
GYM TEACHER: Time out !
VICTOR: Sorry boy . He walks back onto the field .
ELSA: Hey Sparky .
GYM TEACHER: Play ball . Victor swings for the ball again . And misses .
DAD: Nice try son .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: When conducting an experiment , trying is the important thing . It is OK to fail as long as you keep trying .
MOM: Come on Victor- you can do it !
GYM TEACHER: Strike two !
TOSHIAKI: Yes .
MOM: Come on honey !
VICTOR: Sparky ! Noooooo !
MOM: He was a great dog . A great friend .
DAD: The best dog a kid could have .
MOM: When you lose someone you love , they never really leave you . They just move into a special place in your heart . He 'll always be there , Victor .
VICTOR: I do n't want him in my heart . I want him here , with me .
MOM: I know . If we could bring him ack , we would .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Just like lightning , the nervous system is electricity .
CHILDREN: Eww !
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Even after death , the wiring emains . Watch as the muscles espond to the electricity .
MOM: Hi Victor , how was school ? January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 19

MOM: No . Could n't be . She starts up the vacuum again .
BOB'S MOTHER: What ! *screams*
FIRST WOMAN: I know , and Helen said she thought he was putting up some kind of tv antenna on top of the roof !
SECOND WOMAN: In the middle of a thunderstorm ?
FIRST WOMAN: That 's what she said !
SECOND MOTHER: And did you get that big powe surge in the night ? Jack thought it was a fuse box but apparently it effected the whole neighbourhood .
FIRST WOMAN: Sweetie are you ok ? Here you go .
SECOND MOTHER: So anyway Jack loves it here but if the schools were n't so great sometimes I wonder if we would be etter of
MOM: Hi Victor . How was school ?
VICTOR: GoodGottaGo .
MOM: Victor your friend is here .
VICTOR: Edgar ?
VICTOR: Edgar . What are you doing here ?
VICTOR: What ?
VICTOR: Know what ?
VICTOR: No .
VICTOR: Look , I do n't know what you think I know , but I do n't know it .
VICTOR: That 's impossible .
VICTOR: Ssssh ! Mom comes back into the kitchen .
MOM: Oh- yes . Of course .
VICTOR: Alright . Come on .
VICTOR: You ca n't . This is n't an experiment . It 's my dog .
VICTOR: I do n't know . It should have worked .
VICTOR: I have no idea . Sparky growls at the jar .
VICTOR: Promise .
TOSHIAKI: How are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish ?
BOB: Aaah ! He yanks his finger out .
TOSHIAKI: Let me see it .
BOB: Yeah , well , our science fai project is even cooler .
TOSHIAKI: Double top secret .
BOB: Sea monkeys . We got ta come up with something better . Bigger .
TOSHIAKI: I know .
BOB: The science fair is in two days !
TOSHIAKI: I know .
BOB: You 're the smart one .
TOSHIAKI: I know ! A long beat .
VICTOR: Ok , ok , sit still . Ssssh ! Sparky . No ! Sssh . No ! Sssh . Victor ties up Sparky .
NASSOR: Toshiaki says you have an invisible fish .
NASSOR: So you do n't ?
NASSOR: Toshiaki says it 's your science fair project .
NASSOR: So it is n't ? Or it is ?
NASSOR: Do you have an invisible fish ? A beat .
NASSOR: It 's just water . There 's nothing there .
NASSOR: I do n't know what kind of game you and Victor are playing . But that trophy will be mine !
VICTOR: What is it ?
VICTOR: Maybe it just hopped out . Did you have the lid on ?
VICTOR: *Gasp* No ! Sparky ! *Gasp*
BOB: Are you sure this is going to work ? Toshiaki is shaking a soda bottle .
TOSHIAKI: No . That 's why it 's called an experiment . We have to collect data . January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 38
BOB: Do we have to collect it on me ?
TOSHIAKI: Ready ?
BOB: No .
TOSHIAKI: Ten . Nine . Eight .

TOSHIAKI: Seven . Six . Five .
BOB: Computer simulation .
TOSHIAKI: Four . Three . Two .
BOB: I have to pee .
TOSHIAKI: One .
BOB: Whoah , woah , w-w-w-woah woah , whoah , woah , woah , woah .
BOB'S MOTHER: What were you boys doing on the oof ! ? Bob and Toshiaki exchange a glance .
BURGEMEISTER: As mayor of New Holland , you have entrusted me with your safety . So I ca n't sit idly by while a teacher endangers our children .
BOB'S MOTHER: The man is a menace !
ANOTHER FATHER: Have you looked through this `` science '' book they 're using ? Apparently , Pluto is n't good enough to be a planet anymore .
MOM: In fairness , he did n't write the textbook .
DAD: Mr Mayor , Edward Frankenstein , your neighbour of course . I would just like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher . Thinks he 's great .
ANOTHER MOTHER: My Cynthia has been asking all sorts of strange questions . About things I 've never even heard of !
DAD: Should n't we at least give the man the chance to explain himself ?
BURGEMEISTER: Yes . Please come up . MrMenace .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Ladies , Gentlemen . I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant . A sea of stony faces .
MOM: Oh my !
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Thank you . Mr Rzykruski leaves the stage .
DAD: Oh , geeze .
VICTOR: Be quick , boy . They 'll be home any minute .
ELSA: Victor ? January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 42
VICTOR: Hi , Elsa . What are you doing ?
ELSA: Practicing my song for Dutch Day .
VICTOR: It 's nice .
ELSA: Did you get a new dog ?
VICTOR: No .
ELSA: I heard a bark .
VICTOR: Yeah that was me .
ELSA: You were barking .
VICTOR: *Victor pretends to bark and howl* Elsa steps back from the fence .
ELSA: You must really miss Sparky .
VICTOR: I got to go . Bye .
ELSA: Bye .
VICTOR: Where 's Mr. Rzykruski ?
GYM TEACHER: All I know is , I 'll be teaching the class for the rest of the semester . She begins erasing the messy blackboard .
ELSA: Do you know anything about science ?
GYM TEACHER: I know more than you do .
BOB: Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot .
GYM TEACHER: Well , sometimes knowing too much is the problem .
VICTOR: What about the science fair ?
GYM TEACHER: Oh , it 's still on . But it will be judged by someone who is not insane Me ! The class look skeptical .
VICTOR: I ca n't believe they let the gym teacher be the judge . She 's not even interested in science .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Back home , everyone is scientist . Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize . Your country does not make enough scientists . Always needs more . You should be a scientist , Victor .
VICTOR: Nobody likes scientists .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: They like what science gives them , ut not the questions , no , not the questions that science asks .
VICTOR: Actually I have a question .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: That is why you are scientist . Victor smiles , a little .
VICTOR: I was doing my experiment , my project , and the first time it worked great . But the next time it did n't . I mean , it sort of worked , but then it did n't . And I do n't know why .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Then maybe you never really understood it the first time . Victor is puzzled , but intrigued .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Then you changed the variables .
VICTOR: I was doing it for the wrong eason .
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Science is not good or bad , Victor . But it can be used both ways . That is why you must always e careful . With that , he offers his hand . They shake . Victor watches as Mr. Rzykruski drives off .
BOB: I ca n't believe I broke my arm fo nothing . None of us are going to win . E has an invisible fish . January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 46
NASSOR: No he does n't . You fell for a parlor trick .
TOSHIAKI: You 're saying he faked it ?
TOSHIAKI: That fish you showed us , was it eal ?
NASSOR: You brought an animal back from the dead ?
TOSHIAKI: Impossible .
TOSHIAKI: He brought back Sparky ? E nods and the boys exchange a look .
NASSOR: Victor will win the science fair . Unless we can do better . Bigger .
TOSHIAKI: You say you know Victor 's secret . Now is your chance to prove it .
MOM: Now , where is my muffin tin ? She checks inside the oven but no muffin tin .
DAD: Sparky ! Hey . Come on .
VICTOR: Mom ! Dad ! What 's going on ?
DAD: Hey ! Hey ! Just a minute .
VICTOR: No I have to go and find Sparky .
DAD: Victor what have you done ?
VICTOR: You said yourself If you could ing back Sparky , you would .
DAD: Yes , but that was different , ecause we could n't ! It 's easy to promise the impossible . What you did was a very serious thing . Crossing the oundary between life and death eanimating a corpse it 's veryupsetting . January 2012 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 49
VICTOR: I just wanted my dog back .
MOM: Oh sweetheart , we 'll help you look for Sparky but when we get back I think we need to have a little talk . Understood .

BURGEMEISTER: Nonsense . We have the fire chief over here .

We 've all read about your disturbing story . But the people want to hea it from you , Ricky Coogan . Wo n't you tell us your story ?

GEORGE: It is named for the patron saint of creamy desserts As I was saying , we 've worked very closely with Noxon
HERTZ: Thank you , Valdez . That will be all .
RICK: Wait a second
HERTZ: Ricky , this is important . We 're talking about a major threat to the EES image . How does 2 million dollars plus expenses sound ?

RICK: Forget them . I got a better idea . If I can just find the right disguise
ERNIE: Coog , those hippies 'll tear us apart .
RICK: Hey , how 'd you like to make a quick hundred bucks ?
ERNIE: He says the pants do n't usually come off for less than two-fifty , ut since you 're so cute , he 'll make an exception .
JULIE: Are you okay ? Let me help you !
RICK: Thanks . Do n't worry about me . What 's one man 's pain weighed against the global injustice of corporate tyrants like EES ? Go . The fight must continue .
JULIE: Wow My name 's Julie .
RICK: Josh . Josh Tavner .
ERNIE: Mother Theresa . Glad to meet you .
JULIE: Give me those , ape . Help him up . Rick rises to his feet `` painfully . ''
RICK: Same here ! You could ride with us .
JULIE: Us ? You 're with him ? She looks at Ernie , who grins stupidly .
RICK: Oh , he 's okay . Have you ever heard of an idiot savant ?
JULIE: Sure .
RICK: That 's Ernie . Except for the savant part .
JULIE: Is this better ?
ERNIE: Hey Julie . You know I 'm kind of an idea man myself . Like , let 's say there 's a nuclear war , and the only two people left are you and the Pope Would you pork him ?
JULIE: I 'll say ! What a total piece of shit . Do n't you think so , Josh ? Rick grits his teeth .
MUMBLES NONCOMMITTALLY: Well , he 's got a few problems .
JULIE: And what a lousy actor ! I mean can you believe that `` Hey Dude '' crap ?
RICK: Well , with a script that bad , Coogan deserves an Oscar for coming off as good as he did !
CATCHES HIMSELF: I mean , that 's what I read .
JULIE: Well , he 's no Christian Slater .
RICK: SLATER ! ? I could act circles around that one-note hack ! He was shittin ' his diapers when I was the toast of Broadway ! I made grown men cry ! I made crippled children laugh ! Now all I ever hear is Slater ! Slater ! Slater ! WELL
RICK: You think Slater could improv like this ? Make you believe he was an invalid ! ? Huh ! ?
ERNIE: So , do you like Swedish films ? Julie gives him a murderous look .
JULIE: You do n't even want to hear the truth about Noxon , do you , Coogan ?
MORE: 15 . JULIE I mean , look , I 'm not saying this stuff is going to turn anyone into a a
RICK: Human worm
JULIE: Right . A human worm . I mean , that 's just stupid . The point is
RICK: Dog boy
JULIE: Yeah , or a dog boy . That 's absurd .
RICK: Hideous frog man .
JULIE: Okay , okay . Now you 're just being silly . Human suffering 's just a ig joke to you , huh ? You are sick , Coogan !
RICK: Kind of like a family reunion fo you , huh ?
ERNIE: Lighten up , Coog , could be a goof .
JULIE: Is n't it great ? It 's so `` real ''
RICK: Real stupid .
TO ERNIE: Let 's go . This place is dead .
ERNIE: Yeah . Where are all the weirdos ?
ELIJAH: Mutants , yes . Genetic nightmares , definitely . Children of Hell and twisted masses of living , breathing tormented flesh , certainly . But as for weirdos not a one . Unless of course you count me ! Ha ha ha !
RICK: Nah , you seem like a regula dumbshit old redneck to me .
JULIE: I 'm Julie . And you are
ELIJAH: Elijah C. Skuggs , proud proprieto of Skugg 's Fabulous Freak Land and Mutant Emporium . But you knew that . After all , you 've ventured miles away from civilization , hospitals , telephones ,
TO RICK: police How may I help-you ?
RICK: Drop dead .
JULIE: We 'd like to see your freak show . You see , only by appreciating the variety and innovation of nature can we come to respect the fragile complexity of our global eco- system . Elijah nudges Ernie .
ELIJAH: And you come to me looking fo weirdos ?
ERNIE: Hey ! What the
JULIE: Eeuuuwww ( composes herself and
WAVES: Ahem . Hello . Toad does n't respond to her waves .
ELIJAH: Mr. Toad is my assistant . As for the show , I 'm afraid the next parade of deformity is n't until tomorrow night
JULIE: Oh , just our luck
ELIJAH: However ! I do have a private exhibit in my shed you might enjoy . I do n't usually share it with the general public
RICK: We 're deeply honored . But no thanks .
ERNIE: Yeah . We really must be
JULIE: The sideshow tradition has been misrepresented by the media . You do n't traffic in human misery . You show society the part of itself it does n't want to look at .
ELIJAH: Yes Yesm I see
ERNIE: What the heck . We 'll see some pickled dog brains , maybe some pictures of women with , you know , added equipment .
RICK: And to think we could be in the limo with those stewardesses .
ERNIE: What the hell , Coog , these people are weird , but they seem nice enough .
RICK: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ! ?
ELIJAH: Well , I guess they do use the same joke over and over . I 'm just a sucker for that little moffet 's shenanigans , that 's all . ( he tosses the funnies
ASIDE: But perhaps I should tell you a little more about what I do . You see , I not only exhibit freaks , I make them . Just like Michelangelo saw the angel in the stone , I look at a guy like Kevin Costner and see a giant peach grub who can fart the Blue Danube ! ( mops brow , asks
OFFHANDEDLY: Am I crazy or is it hot in here ?
ELIJAH: Behold ! The Tasty Freekz machine !
JULIE: My God ! He 's using Noxon Twenty- Four !
RICK: Hey ! You 're not supposed to have that stuff !
ELIJAH: Oh ? Well , I guess I 'm not supposed to have these either !
JULIE: Wait a minute . Does this mean we 're not going to see a show ?
ELIJAH: Toad , fire up that machine , and let 's turn these hapless asswipes into monstrosities !
TOGETHER: AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !
ELIJAH: Now let 's see . Who wants to get freaked first ?
ERNIE: Ladies first !
JULIE: Go screw yourself !
ERNIE: If I were you , I would !
ELIJAH: Hmmmm .
ERNIE: Wait a second . You 're really gon na smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts ! ?
ELIJAH: Correct .
ERNIE: Well then could you give me a eally big rodney ?
ELIJAH: I 'm a mad scientist pal , not a miracle worker .
ELIJAH: Gumby ! Put that thing away !
JULIE: NOOOOO !
ERNIE: Well , at least I 'll never have to go far for a piece of tail .
JULIE: Pig ! She SMACKS him .
ERNIE: Ouch ! I was just trying to keep things light . Oh God ! Why me ! ?
JULIE: Mother always said there 'd be days like this . And I thought she was nuts ! They exit . Elijah turns to Rick .
ELIJAH: A mere party trick . But you , you 're gon na be special .
RICK: Let me go , Skuggs , or else !
MORE: 24 .
APPROACH: I got some other friends who can score you box seats at the Superbowl , no problem .
RICK: Yeah , that 's me !
ELIJAH: You were great in that picture ! Oh well , I guess for the next one they 'll have to get Christian Slater ! HA-HA-HA !
RICK: Huh ?
ELIJAH: Still is if you ask me ! Hell , even half-done , you 'll be the star of the show tonight . Elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse .
RICK: Great use of the space .
ELIJAH: I learned it all from Bob Vila . BOB VILA walks up next to Elijah .
BOB: You know you could expose those ustic beams and put in a skylight over one weekend , Elijah .
ELIJAH: Give it a rest , Bob !
BOB: No problem . It 's all here in my Beds and Bathrooms book , Elijah . And you pay nothing for thirt
RICK: Ernie ? Julie ?
ERNIE: Over here , Coog .
JULIE: Are you alright ?
RICK: I know that voice . That 's the voice that said ,
MIMICS: `` Cool , a freak show . Let 's check it out ! ''
JULIE: What ! ? Oh sure , blame the woman . Typical .
RICK: `` It 's so real . '' Is this real enough for you ? I 'm friggin ' Quasimodo !
ERNIE: Chill out , Coog . You 're talking to the original tag team of ugly pukes . Step into the light .
RICK: Okay , here I come .
ERNIE: ULP !
JULIE: Oh geez It 's not so evolting . After all , physical eauty is just a socially-enforced myth that we , uh , oh shit ULPI Julie turns away and pukes on the floor .
RICK: Yeah , well , you 're no Mona Lisas yourself . You 're lucky I 've got a strong stomach !
JUAN: Freak ? Ha ha hahahaha ! I am Juan the Dog Boy , leader of the freaks .
JULIE: Kind of the `` top dog . ''
JUAN: Welcome to Hell , Rick . Shake ?
RICK: No thanks . I do n't plan on staying long . How many of you are there in here anyway ?
JUAN: First , I have a question for you , Ricardo . Who starred in the film `` International Velvet ? ''
RICK: Huh ?
JUAN: Well , perhaps we should ask the Worm !
THE WORM: Yes , yes very interesting International Velvet The perfectly appalling sequel to National Velvet , I believe . No dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever .
JUAN: Yes , Worm . But who was the star ?
WORM: Olivia DeHavilland .
JUAN: Olivia DeHavilland Rick , do you agree or disagree ?
RICK: This is nuts . This is crazy Besides , it was Tatum O'Neill .
JUAN: Very good . It was Tatum O'Neill , now married to tennis star John McEnroe . Circle gets the square .
OTHER FREAKS: Yayyy !
WORM: Blast . O'Neill No talent agamuffin
JUAN: okay , JulieErnie , your turn . Who 's it going to be ?
BEARDED LADY: How ya ' doin .
JUAN: Sockhead !
ERNIE: Call me old-fashioned , but I 'll go with Paul Lynde .
JULIE: Do n't be an idiot .
JUAN: You see , Rick ? Just because we 're freaks does n't mean we ca n't have some fun , huh ? Rick is overwhelmed by it all . He backs away .
RICK: Get away from me . Get away ! I 'm not like you . You hear me ? I 'm Ricky Coogan ! I AM NOT A FREAK !
ERNIE: Okay Coog , so I get twenty fou hour access to T ` n ' A , and you look like a plate of rancid giblets . We 're still pals , right ? Rick shoots him a look .
JULIE: All the freaks have gone through this anguish , Rick . At first , I was blinded by my anger . I admit it . I wanted to break your neck for getting me into this . But I got over it . Juan taught me to channel my anger for the common good .
RICK: It was your fault , anyway . You wanted to see the freak show .
RICK: Ernie !
ERNIE: Oh Sorry , Coog . For a second there , I was a total man-hater . Weird .
JULIE: Here . Take it . Rick examines the cover . He reads it aloud .
RICK: `` So You 're a Hideous Mutant Freak Now What ? '' There 's an `` 8 '' scribbled on the pamphlet .
JULIE: we 're in cubicle eight . Maybe later you 'll be ready to talk .
RICK: Forget it . Not me . I 'm not like those other god-forsaken animals .
WORM: You 're mistaken , Rick . You are exactly like us . We were all normal healthy folk before we made the fateful mistake of visiting this hell hole at an off hour . Why , when I first came here
WAVY FLASHBACK: DISSOLVE TO
WORM: At first , the transformation was fabulous . I truly understood the worm 's ethos like never before . But those early days of fascination are over . Now , in retrospect , I think the whole thing is a fucking headache . I 'd sell my soul just to e able to wipe my own ass
SOCKHEAD: I first came here as a tourist , looking for some fun
FLASHBACK: DISSOLVE TO
SOCKHEAD: Sorry . I 'm not much for stories . The camera moves in on the BEARDED LADY .
BEARDED LADY: When I arrived here , I was nothing like I am now .
FLASHBACK: DISSOLVE TO
WORM: You are one of us now , Rick . Whether you admit it or not . It 's irrefutable .
RICK: Yeah . Says you .
TIME DISSOLVE: TO
RICK: You 're right .
JUAN: Hey . Mind your business .
ERNIE: Sorry .
RICK: Well that EES guy should rescue me any minute . Then it 's straight to the plastic surgeon and back to sunny old L.A . I wonder how many of my beautiful , anatomically correct girlfriends will be waiting for me .
COWBOY: Seeing phantom trolls , Rick ?
RICK: No .
COWBOY: Sounds to me like you 've developed a telepathic bond . Do n't mean ye nuts or nuthin ' . Heck , old Nosey , why he can smell the future . Lots of us freaks got E.S.P . And Sockhead , he 's got E.S.P.N .
SOCKHEAD: Watch out , Hulk ! He 's gon na try the skull cracker !
COWBOY: Shucks , Rick , you 're lucky . Telepathy like yours only occurs etween real soulmates . A bond like that should be cherished .
STUEY: Wow ! I 'm Ricky Coogan 's soulmate !
RICK: In your dreams ! Now get lost , troll !
STUEY: Wait 'll I tell the kids at school !
COWBOY: Shucksm Rick , it do n't make sense to spurn your soulmate . I reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart .
STUEY: Once America sees what happened to Ricky , they 'll probably send the whole FBI down to save him !
LAUGHING MAN: Heh heh heh heh hehh heh .
STUEY: Sure I wrote the article . But
LAUGHING MAN: Ha-ha-ha !
STUEY: No . You 've got it all wrong . I do n't know anything about that . You got ta believe me .
LAUGHING MAN: Ho-ho-hahahaha hee hee hoohaaa !
HUMAN TORCH: Wow , what a great model ! But look , this one 's crooked .
ELIJAH: Alright , freaks ! Get ready for the glamour ! Get ready for the glitz ! Get ready to be pelted with rotten vegetables , 'cause it 's showtime !
CLOWN: C'mon , my granny could throw bette than you !
ELIJAH: Quiet , please .
AUDIENCE: But first up , prepare to behold an unspeakably repulsive yet heartwarming atrocity , Three Men and a Baby !
RICK: Arrrggg . I am Beast Boy . I will eat you . Arrrghh . ( he throws down the
SCRIPT: I ca n't do this shit !
RICK: Damn it ! What 's keeping those guys ? The Worm creeps up behind Rick .
WORM: Something 's troubling you , my boy . what is it ?
RICK: Well , let 's see . I 've been kidnapped , hideously disfigured , imprisoned with a bunch of mutant freaks , my rescue party is M.I.A. , and this dialogue makes `` Hey Dude Three '' read like `` Dr . Zhivago . ''
WORM: I think I know what you 're going through . I too had an eating disorder . You see , I 've always had a feverish obsession with pudding . And when I was a young lad Rick groans and looks out at the audience .
ROSIE: EEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIEEEEEE
ERNIE: Hey Julie , how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
JULIE: How many ?
ERNIE: Two . One to screw it in and one to ide my Rodney ! Ha-ha-ha !
JULIE: Oaf !
BEARDED LADY: If your coloring is in the autumn ange , like Maria 's , try an earth tone eye makeup . Now I 've done a lovely French braid on Maria , but I encourage everyone to experiment and use your imagination . The main thing is to just have fun with it . The audience is engrossed . Some take notes .
MAN: He 's got a hand under there !
SOMEONE ELSE: It 's a hoax !
ELIJAH: Puppetteering is an admirable skill in its own right ! Give him his due !
THE CROWD: Where 's the beast boy you promised us ! ? Bring on the beast boy ! We want the beast boy !
WORM: And when I won first prize , they never called me pudding-head again .
RICK: So ?
WORM: Do n't you see ? You must turn you hardship into inspiration ! You 're an actor , Rick ! Your body is you instrument , and with it you must play your tragic symphony for all the world !
ELIJAH: They 're going nuts for you , Beast Boy ! You better go out there now ! He starts to take off his jungle costume .
RICK: I 'll be right there .
TO WORM: Thank you Worm . I do n't really know how I can repay you for this .
WORM: You could wipe my ass .
RICK: Ha-ha ! Always the wit , eh Worm ?
WORM: Damn . Nosey , have I ever told you what a gifted artist you are ? Nosey gives him a worried look .
RICK: Now is the winter of ou discontent , Made glorious summer by this son of York , But I that am not shaped fo sportive tricks , Nor made to court an amorous looking glass , I , that am curtailed of this fai proportion , Cheated of feature by dissembling nature ,
ALISTAIR COOKE: If you 're having trouble understanding Mr. Coogan 's illiant reading of this soliloquy from Richard the Third , please take advantage of the handy subtitles for the culturally illiterate .
FILTHY PEASANT: SHHH !
RICK: Deformed , unfinished , sent before my time ,
{I'M UGLY}: Into this breathing world , scarse half made up ,
RICK: I 'm saved ! Haha ! You sorry mutants are gon na rot in this hole while I 'm sipping mint juleps by the pool !
KEVIN: Rick , Rick , listen , I really love this new look you 've come up with . But just between you and me , I do n't think the guys upstairs would eally get it .
RICK: What are you saying ! ?
CHUCKLES SNIDELY: I 'm saying you 're ugly enough to urn the nosehairs off a dead nun .
ALISTAIR COOKE: AH-HA-HA-HA ! WHAT A PUTZ !
RICK: EAT SHIT !
KEVIN'S HEAD: Now you 're just being childish .
CROWD: AHHHHHH ! HELP ! LET US OUT OF HERE !
ELIJAH: Now that 's entertainment .
NOSEY: I 'd like to buy a vowel .
RICK: Hey . The Wheel . Mind if I sit in ? Juan advances towards Rick , sneering .
JUAN: So . Now you do n't mind mixing with ushow did you say itsorry mutants ?
RICK: Look ! I 'm sorry for what happened at the show . Ca n't you just forget it ?
ERNIE: Hey , should n't you tell Rick about your big escape plan ?
RICK: You have an escape plan ?
JUAN: Listen , Beast Boy , the games are a simple diversion .
MORE: 51 . JUAN Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks cry out for freedom ! Aooooooorrraaaagh !
FREAKS: Aoo Beat .
JULIE: Juan 's plan is really ingenious Rick . See , he figured out that
JUAN: I figured out that our escape does not include the Beast Boy . No one may discuss the plan with him , understand ?
RICK: What 's the matter with all of you ? You trust your lives to a guy just 'cause he can lick his own privates ?
ERNIE: You got ta admit , Coog , it 's a helluva trick .
RICK: Fine ! I 'll just come up with an escape plan of my own then .
JUAN: Haha ! I have spent a year studying this hellhole , devising the perfect escape . You think you 'll just tango right out the door ! ? Ha ! Just try it , amigo .
RICK: I will !
JULIE: Rick , wait .
ERNIE: Yeah . Do n't go off half-cocked . Believe me , it ai n't all it 's cracked up to be .
JULIE: This is n't one of your dumb movies , Coogan . Look , Juan 's a good dog , a smart dog . I 'll talk to him . Do n't be stupid , Rick . You ca n't do it without us .
RICK: Forget it ! I do n't need you , EES , or anybody else ! I 'll get out of here all by myself , you you. , . crud sucking pus monkeys !
ERNIE: I 'm getting a bad feeling here .
RICK: Damn .

VOICE: Ooohh Milk me ! Milk me now ! Milk me hard ! I 've only got two hands , all right ? Geez . I do n't care if Elijah did give you skim milk on the right side , chocolate on the left , and eggnog in the middle . The milkman is salivating at the door .
MILKMAN: Gee , I love eggnog !
RICK: Shit .
JAMAICAN ACCENTS: Rastafari .
ELIJAH: Diet soda ?
RICK: No thanks .
ELIJAH: Fiddle Faddle ? You sure ?
RICK: Well , okay . ( he scoops some into his
MOUTH: Well , are you gon na torture me o kill me or something ?
ELIJAH: Torture my greatest creation ever ! ? Kill the final piece of the puzzle that I 've been putting together fo years ! ? Sure , it 'd be fun , but I 've got a bigger plan , my boy .
MORE: 56 . ELIJAH And when you ripped off that guy 's head , I knew it was working like gangbusters !
RICK: But I thought I scared everyone away .
ELIJAH: Uh-huh . And then they told two friends , and they told two friends , and so on , and so on . Look at this .
ANOTHER LETTER: The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting spree , and Oscar is along for the ide ! That one 's from Pat Collins !
RICK: Yeah , but she loves everything .
ELIJAH: Toad ! That Fiddle Faddle is fo guests only ! You 've had enough !
RICK: Look SkuggsElijahI 've been in show business all my life . The public does not want to see disgusting , depraved violent filth .
ELIJAH: Oh , and I suppose Jake and the Fatman is just a fluke ?
TOAD: AAAGGGGHH ! 58 .
ELIJAH: I told you enough !
BEARDED LADY: Hey Rick , I thought you were gon na come up with your own escape plan ?
RICK: This is your big plan ? A dozen milkmen ? Is n't that a little unusual ?
JUAN: Twelve milkmen is theoretically possible . Thirteen is silly . Looks like one milkman too many , Coogan .
RICK: Fine then . Go ahead . Hope you like reggae , ya flea bitten astard .
JUAN: And I ca n't let you stop us .
ELIJAH: That 's a lot of milkmen on the same oute . No wonder they fight .
JUAN: Squirrel !
NOSEY: Wow , giant Rasta eyeballs , just like Rick said .
SOCKHEAD: Gosh , if it was n't for Rick , we 'd all be dead !
OTHER FREAKS: Yeah ! Way to go Rick ! Alright !
ERNIE: God , I ca n't believe he left you for a squirrel . What a dick . Julie 's hurt . She does n't even smack Ernie .
RICK: You know how men are . Besides , it was a pretty good looking squirrel .
JULIE: Come on . You heard the Beast Boy . Back to the Freak House , now .
ERNIE: Not again .
TO RICK: Oh well , at least we 'll get to try a new position .
BOB: Notice the way I use an elliptical motion to chafe Stuey 's buttocks . ( the Goons nod
ATTENTIVELY: It 's all here in my new book Pipes , Fixtures , and Torturing

STUEY HOLOGRAM: Rick ! Do something ! It 's up to you , Rick ! Pleeeeeeease !
RICK: The Laughing Man !

JULIE: `` Tape Donahue Renew Subscription to Beaver World '' Eeuw !
ERNIE: Beaver World ! ? Julie smacks himhe swallows the deodorant .
RICK: After that .
JULIE: `` Prepare demonstration for Laughing Man , receive five thousand barrels of Noxon . '' Five thousand barrels ! ?
RICK: Elijah 's up to something big , and we have to stop him . Ernie BELCHES . Rick sniffs the air .
SOCKHEAD: We 're done for ! We 're done for ! I do n't want to die ! It 's the end of the world ! The apocalypse ! Aahh ! He stops . Everyone is staring at him .
RICK: I have n't said anything yet .
SOCKHEAD: Sorry . I 'm not much for timing . He takes his seat again .
RICK: Tomorrow night , at the show , I 'll e turned into a homicidal monste and forced to kill you all . But we might have a chance if we act fast . And I 'm prepared to be your new leader .
NOSEY: I say we kill him . Sockhead nods .
RICK: And I 've got a plan .
NOSEY: I still say we kill him . Sockhead nods again .
RICK: If we can get into Elijah 's lab , maybe we can
WORM: Of course ! Design a super freak of our own and manipulate the genetic code to make him destroy Elijah instead of us ! Brilliant !
RICK: Oh . Well
BEARDED LADY: But how do we get to the lab ?
RICK: Um , maybe
COWBOY: Right ! The worm could dig a tunnel !
WORM: By God , it 's so crazy it might just work !
ERNIE: But you need Noxon 24 to make the freaking sludge , and Elijah told us himself he 's run out of it .
RICK: Oh . Oh yeah . Well , see , what I was going to say was
JULIE: Yes ! Exactly ! If they 've been using Noxon 24 as a fertilize here , the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it ! All we need is a way to extract it from the vegetation , ideally into a liquid form .
RICK: Right . Well , what about
COWBOY: Golly ! So that 's why my milk comes out that funny green color ! I thought the grass tasted funny ! Wow , Rick , you 're a genius !
JULIE: Good thinking , Rick . The freaks all nod in agreement .
NOSEY: Way to go , Rick ! How did you eve think of such a plan ?
RICK: Well , actually , I was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys , train them to fire guns , and make a break for it . But if you want to go with this othe thing , I guess that 's okay .
NOSEY: SOR-RY . What a jerk !
RICK: Hey , look at this !
WORM: Good Lord ! It 's the Lost City of Nodd !
JULIE: Wow !
RICK: It 's Old Faithful ! ( foriegn take `` It 's the Blarney Stone ! '' ]

RICK: You did it , Worm ! Way to go !
JULIE: But how ? You did n't even use the Noxon .
WORM: Ah ! You do n't need Noxon to make Butterscotch pudding . I just wanted to test the machine 's capabilities . Mmmm ! Glorious ! So creamy ! Yum !
JULIE: Hang on , Rick . Do you really think we should put this toxic glop on you ? What if it does n't work ? What if something goes wrong ? What
ERNIE: If it does work , do you think there 'll be enough left over to give me a monster size rodney ?
RICK: Here , hold this .
ERNIE: Seven bucks .
JULIE: Sometimes seven fifty .
RICK: Alright . It does n't matter .
ERNIE: Sure it does . They do n't let you into the theater if you do n't pay the price of the ticket .

But we 'd heard reports of Skuggs 's reckless abuse of Noxon , and when the story broke in the tabloids , I decided to personally come down and get to the bottom of things .

REGIS: That 's just great . What a story . And what an ending ! Elijah transformed by the goop !
KATHIE LEE: And he really looked like ?
RICK: Exactly like you two , I swear . Same faces , same outfits , except they had these really big , hideous feet
ELIJUS: Show 's over , Ricky !
ELLY LEE: I 'm gon na drink your blood !

MORE: 104 . RICK When man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earth 's natural order , the only thing he 'll create is havoc .
ERNIE: Right , Coog . I learned somethin ' too . That men and women truly are equals . That the human spirit transcends gender and physical appearance , and thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise . I believe it was Moliere
JULIE: Oh , shut up . Let 's go fuck .
DREAM CHILDREN: One two Freddy 's coming fo you .
MEAGAN: Lizzy ?
LIZZY: Playing with my friend .

LIZZY: I was scared .
MEAGAN: Do n't worry they ca n't hurt you .
LIZZY: Promise ?
MEAGAN: Promise . Lizzy hugs Meagan .
NEWS REPORTER: As the sun rises on yet anothe morning , still no end in sight fo the standoff between police and the mysterious group known only as the `` Freddy '' cult who seized the abandoned house behind me just thirteen days ago . These cultists mostly run- away teenagers have managed to keep police at bay for almost two weeks while inside they take mind- altering narcotics in order to communicate with their god Freddy .
MEAGAN: Morning .
MEAGAN'S DAD: Morning , Meagan .
MEAGAN'S MOM: Lizzy ! Get down here ! Breakfast is almost ready !
NEWS REPORTER: Alleged child murderer Fred Kruege was released on a legal technicality ut later burned to death at the hands of a vigilante mob of grieving parents . Some years later , a rash of bizarre and unexplainable teen- age deaths began leaving many in the area to wonder is Freddy eally dead ?
MEAGAN'S MOM: Hurry up and eat . You do n't want to be late for special school .
MEAGAN: Mom ! Do n't call it that !
LIZZY: I hate that school . The other kids are mean and they 're all re- tard-ed ! Meagan snickers .
MEAGAN'S MOM: We do n't use that word . They 're `` special '' children just like you 're `` special '' .
NEWS REPORTER: The cult members have declined to an on-camera interview but did send out a note with a message . The note which , by the way , appears to have been written in blood reads To the parents of Springwood Freddy lives ! Soon he will come and take one of your children as his virgin bride . Then Freddy will -BEEP- and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and -BEEP- and behold , a soulless child shall be born . The vessel for Freddy to rise and rule the darkness foreve and ever . A horn TOOTS outside .
MEAGAN: That 's Jesse . Let 's go , Lizzy .
MEAGAN'S DAD: Oh , look at the time ! I 've got to e going anyone need me to bring anything home tonight ?
MEAGAN: I need an alarm clock .
MEAGAN'S DAD: What 's wrong with your old one ?
MEAGAN: Broke .
MEAGAN'S MOM: We 're almost out of vodka .
JESSE: Good morning ! Hey , what 's the matter ?
MEAGAN: My mom
JESSE: And ?
MEAGAN: I had another dream last night
JESSE: Was I naked ?
MEAGAN: No . You were Jason .
JESSE: Jason ? Oh , yeech Was I any good ?
MEAGAN'S DAD: Do you have to watch that crap all the time ? Months and months of the O.J . Simpson trial , and now this
NEWS REPORTER: I 'm standing here with State Troope Captain Renton Murdoch , the man the Governor has called in to deal with the cultists because of his past experience with occult-style murderers . In fact , Trooper Murdoch is the only law enforcement office ever to survive a one-on-one encounte with notorious Camp Crystal Lake killer Jason Voorhees . You received some pretty nasty injuries in your battle with Jason , did n't you , Captain ?
MURDOCH: Nothing serious just a few stitches .
NEWS REPORTER: What about these so called `` Freddy '' cultists ? They seem like pretty tough customers . Think you 'll have any trouble getting them out of there ?
MURDOCH: No . Now that the Governor has given me complete authority to deal with these punks I should be putting an end to their situation pretty quick . Unless of course their attorney is able to get them to come out peace- fully but I do n't hold out much hope for that .
NEWS REPORTER: Captain Renton Murdoch , ladies and gentlemen . A tough cop for tough criminals .
MURDOCH: Damn media oughtta be a law . Is that shyster still in there trying to talk them out ?
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: Yeah he 's making them some kind of deal .
MURDOCH: Damn lawyers what a bunch of assholes . Shakespeare was right kill all the lawyers . Then we could kill all the punks with no hassles and the world would be a safer place .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: Smaller anyway .
MURDOCH: Ahhhhh what did Shakespeare know ? Long-haired , English freak . He was probably a punk .
SLEAZY LAWYER: So , as I explained to you before , the revenues between the TV movie deal and the book sale should be adequate to fund your joint-defense . And I think with my mass media hypnosis argument I could get each of you a reduced sentence on appeal say twenty years each . Out in fifteen with good behavior ? Hmmmmm ?
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: Jesus Christ !
MURDOCH: Freeze ! Murdoch exits , laughing to himself .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: Hold your fire !
MURDOCH: Looks like we 'll have to hunt the est of them down . Let 's go before they get too far .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: We ca n't leave ! Ca n't you see we 've got a situation here ? Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs .
MURDOCH: Leave her .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: You 're crazy ! I ca n't just leave her !
MURDOCH: Forget it . I 've seen this before . There 's nothing you can do .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: I 've got to try
MURDOCH: You 're wasting your time .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: Fuck it !
MURDOCH: Punks .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: Are you okay , honey ?
MURDOCH: I told you you were wasting you time . Once these kids go rabid , est thing to do is put 'em down .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: You ca n't be serious
MURDOCH: Dead serious . See the world is made up of rules . Kids do n't like ules . They rebel for a while , but ultimately they start to fall in line and become ordinary Joe 's like you and me . But some kids dope smokers mainly , watching their MTV Satanic lyrics melting what 's left of their brains these kids grow up to be punks . And when these punks step as far over the line as these `` Freddy '' punks have then we as peace officers have no choice but to kill them .
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER: I did n't become a peace officer to kill kids .
MURDOCH: Punks . There 's a difference barely .
MEAGAN: Yes , ma'am ?
MISS KREPPS: I asked if you were ready to give your oral report ?
MEAGAN: Yes I 'm ready .
MISS KREPPS: Please come up here to the podium .
MEAGAN: My report is on Global Economic Trends . Try and think of a world where there is no poverty no sickness no crime . A world where everyone is happy to be alive and everyone lives together in peace . This is my dream .
MISS KREPPS: Louder , Meagan . We ca n't hear you .
FREDDY: Aww all dressed up and nowhere to blow !
MEAGAN: Jesse please , help me .
FREDDY: Looks like a photo opportunity to me !
MISS KREPPS: Meagan ? Meagan ? ! Meagan looks around , bewildered and confused .
MEAGAN: Sure Meagan stands up and faints .
SCHOOL NURSE: Meagan ? Can you hear me ? Do you know where you are ?
MEAGAN: I was day dreaming and then I woke up but then it was like I was still dreaming and then I woke up and then I guess I fainted and now I 'm awake again
SCHOOL NURSE: Are you sure ? Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment .
MEAGAN: I 'm waiting to see if you 're going to turn into Freddy .
SCHOOL NURSE: Freddy I see . You 've been watching too much CNN . That crazy `` Freddy '' cult thing it 's all over the TV day and night you ca n't get away from it . No wonder you kids are all having nightmares .
MEAGAN: But this one was different it felt real .
SCHOOL NURSE: But that 's just it , Meagan dreams are n't real . They 're just broken fragments of the subconscious mind .
MEAGAN: Fear is real though , is n't it ? And if nightmares are fear , then does n't that make them real ? ! And if the nightmares are real then is reality like a dream ? !
SCHOOL NURSE: Meagan ! You 've got heat prostration that 's all . The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face .
MEAGAN: Old witch what does she know ? She is n't even qualified to give a shot and she 's telling me that my dreams are n't anything to worry about .
JESSE: So she said you were okay ?
MEAGAN: Oh , sure Madame Curie in there says it 's just a case of heat pro- stration and an overdose of TV news . Ruined my makeup , too .
JESSE: So you 're going back to class ?
MEAGAN: No . She gave me last period off .
JESSE: Well , what are you bitching about ? I could have a compound fracture of the skull and she would n't excuse me from P.E .
MEAGAN: Jesse ! I 've been having nightmares for almost two weeks now and they keep getting worse ! Now I 'm having daymares ! I want to know why !
JESSE: Okay well , did n't the nurse say it was heat probation ? Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration .
MEAGAN: You do n't understand I want to know more about dreams . What they mean why we have them .
JESSE: Okay , Meg , go look it up . You 've got the rest of the day off , that 's all I 'm saying .
MEAGAN: That 's a good idea . Why do n't you cut last period and come with me ?
JESSE: Sure . Where are we going ?
MEAGAN: The library .
JESSE: You want me to cut school so we can go to the library ?
MEAGAN: Find anything ? Jesse looks up suddenly .
JESSE: What ? Oh , no nothing yet .
MEAGAN: Did you know that our sub-conscious etains everything that ever happened to us ? Everything . From the time we 're born until we die .
JESSE: Really ?
MEAGAN: That 's how Freddy gets at us y using our sub-conscious fears . Fears our conscious minds have epressed or forgotten .
JESSE: I 've got a news flash for you Freddy 's dead .
MEAGAN: I 'm not so sure if Freddy exists in our sub-conscious then he can never be fully erased . Like a bad memory you may blot it out of your mind but it will alway be hiding someplace in your dreams . Were n't you scared as a child by something so stupid that you 're ashamed to admit it ?
JESSE: No .
MEAGAN: No ?
JESSE: Well , yeah .
MEAGAN: Well , what ? What is it ?
JESSE: Well when I was kid , my brothe took me to the carnival . And in the penny arcade there was this robot gunslinger
MEAGAN: Black Bart .
JESSE: You know about Black Bart ?
MEAGAN: Duh . You put your quarter in and he says , `` Go ahead and draw , tenderfoot . '' And then you pull your gun out and shoot him .
JESSE: That 's just it I never could ! I 'd point the gun right at him and shoot , and I could never hit the guy . So I always got killed .
MEAGAN: No one can hit him it 's a gyp .
JESSE: Scared the shit out of me . Meagan tries to hide her smile .
MEAGAN: I remember Lizzy wandered off one day and we could n't find her . The police came and everything . I was n't really worried until I saw her picture on TV then I got eally scared . Jesse , I ca n't explain it but I think something bad 's going to happen .
LEONARD: You 're stupid !
LIZZY: No , you are !
LEONARD: They forgot you again !
LIZZY: No , they did n't !
LEONARD: Yes , they forgot and you 're goin ' to wait out here until it 's dark and then the monsters are goin ' come and get you !
LIZZY: No they wo n't , because I 'm walkin ' home !
LEONARD: Come back , Lizzy ! You can wait with me ! I got forgot too , you know !
MEAGAN'S DAD: Did n't you get my message ?
MEAGAN: What message ?
MEAGAN'S DAD: I called the school after lunch I had to stay late after work
MEAGAN'S MOM: Do n't you dare blame this on her , you sorry bastard ! It 's all you fault ! Where have you been anyway ?
MEAGAN: The library .
MEAGAN'S MOM: A likely Goddamn story ! Meagan 's mom breaks down sobbing .
MEAGAN: Dad what 's wrong ? What 's happened ? Where 's Lizzy ?
MEAGAN'S DAD: She did n't come home from school today . The police got a report that a girl fitting Lizzy 's description was forced into a car by some crazies . They 're pretty sure it was this `` Freddy '' cult .
MEAGAN: Oh , my God
MEAGAN'S DAD: Now do n't worry . The police are doing everything they can .
TROOPER: Hey , Cap ' n better have a look up here !
MEAGAN: No no , she would n't do that ! Lizzy would n't join Freddy 's cult !
TROOPER: I know it 's hard to believe , miss . But a lot of good kids get caught up in this kind of trouble .
MURDOCH: Punks
MEAGAN'S DAD: Captain Murdoch is there any- thing we can do ?
MURDOCH: You can pray , sir . Pray we find you daughter before well , before it 's too late . But rest assured , if I ca n't persuade her to come back to her loving home , then I 'll do what 's est for her . I know you and you wife would n't want her to suffer . Come on I want to go talk to Erwin .
JESSE: Where are we going ?
MEAGAN: Over to Stormie 's .
JESSE: Stormie ? I thought you and her were n't friends anymore since she stole that twenty dollars from you .
MEAGAN: That was her `` klepto '' phase when she was dating that gang member . She dumped him a long time ago .
JESSE: I still do n't understand . What has she got to do with Lizzy missing ?
MEAGAN: She used to be in the Freddy cult . Maybe she knows where they took Lizzy . They exit to Jesse 's car .
STORMIE: If I did know I would call the police , you know that . I love Lizzy . No telling what those freaks will do to her . Those Freddy cult guys are hard core .
JESSE: I thought you were in the cult ?
STORMIE: I was in the cult for a week cause my boyfriend at the time Slasher , he was . But I just liked the music and the clothes when they were clean , but not like the violence and stuff . But that was just my `` cult '' phase but I got past that . You know , just like my `` gang '' phase when I was dating Ramon and then efore that was my `` death rock '' phase when I was dating Stuart
JESSE: Uh , excuse me but what phase are we in now ?
STORMIE: Militant feminist , man-hating phase , what 's it fuckin ' to ya ? !
JESSE: Why do n't you just let the cops find her ? That guy Renton Murdoch he knows how to deal with these cultist psychos . He was the man who got Jason Voorhees .
MEAGAN: That guy in my dreams
STORMIE: Jason kicked his ass .
JESSE: Well yeah . But Murdoch put thirteen bullets in Jason before he hacked his head open .
STORMIE: Well , one of my mom 's boyfriends worked at the hospital where they took him . He said that Murdoch lost more than half his brain and what little that was left was all twisted up inside . And they had to replace his skull with a metal plate to keep that from leaking out .
JESSE: So what 's different about him ?
STORMIE: One thing he used to be a Democrat . Now he votes straight Republican .
MEAGAN: I think he thinks Lizzy joined the cult or something .
STORMIE: Oh , my God he 'll kill her .
MEAGAN: I 've got to find Lizzy myself . I 've got to find her and save her from Freddy before that crazy cop kills her .
JESSE: Just where are you going to look ? I mean , these cult guys could be holding her anywhere .
MEAGAN: Murdoch said something about going to talk to somebody named Erwin .
STORMIE: Erwin Kelper ! He used to be in the Freddy cult ! I bet he knows where they took Lizzy !
JESSE: Not Squirmin ' Erwin that freak that used to eat bugs ?
STORMIE: Who else ? Erwin is scary smart always brought home `` A '' s but he was kinda fucked up , too I mean , who is n't really ? Anyway , he quit the cult a few months ack and the cops put him away fo his own safety . They say Freddy 's put a death hex on Erwin .
JESSE: A death hex ?
STORMIE: Yes , a death hex . You know where someone wants you dead !
MEAGAN: Where is he ?
JESSE: Why ?
MEAGAN: Do n't be mad it 's just that you might scare him .
JESSE: Scare him ?
STORMIE: What she 's subtly trying to tell you is that this needs a woman 's gentle touch butthead .
MEAGAN: Just stay here okay ?
SECURITY GUARD: Yo , Erwin you 've got a couple of visitors . Now be a good boy You 've got five minutes . I 'll be ight down the hall if you need me .
MEAGAN: Erwin ?
ERWIN: SHOW ME YOUR ARMS ! YOUR ARMS !
MEAGAN: Shoot ?
STORMIE: He 's talking about dream dope the stuff the cultists shoot up with so they can talk to Freddy .
MEAGAN: I do n't do drugs .
ERWIN: You 're not in the cult ?
MEAGAN: No .
ERWIN: Did n't Freddy send you to kill me ?
STORMIE: Chill , Erwin . We 're here for some hard data not a floppy disk .
ERWIN: Well , what do you want ? Ca n't you see I 'm busy ?
MEAGAN: Freddy 's cult kidnapped my sister .
STORMIE: I told her you might know where they took her .
ERWIN: I already told the cops everything I know .
MEAGAN: Tell me please .
ERWIN: Look I 'm sorry about your sister , ut I 've got my own problems with Freddy . I 'm a marked man , you know .
MEAGAN: Then tell me why they took her
ERWIN: To bear his child . Freddy wants to e human again . In order to do that he has to be `` reborn '' .
MEAGAN: How can he do that ?
ERWIN: He has to marry a virgin on holy ground . Then the cult consumate the marriage by impregnating her .
STORMIE: The whole cult ? Yeech !
ERWIN: Freddy 's the son of a hundred maniacs . It 's sort of a tradition with him .
MEAGAN: So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant ?
ERWIN: And Freddy enters the soul of the fetus through a dream state . Voila ! Rebirth .
STORMIE: That 's the stupidest shit I eve heard .
ERWIN: Hey , they 're not my rules some- ody else wrote 'em .
MEAGAN: Erwin you 've got to help me find Lizzy . You 're my only hope . Erwin thinks about this for a second , then
ERWIN: I 'll help you find your sister , but you 've got to help me .
MEAGAN: Anything . Just name it .
ERWIN: You have to help me kill Freddy . Meagan and Stormie exchange looks .
STORMIE: But Freddy 's dead .
ERWIN: Freddy lives If only in our dreams .
STORMIE: Come on , Meagan our five minutes is up . He 's giving me the creeps . But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin
MEAGAN: How can you kill a dream ?
ERWIN: When it 's not a dream . Do we have a deal ?
MEAGAN: Deal .
JESSE: No ! I wo n't do it !
MEAGAN: Come on , Jesse ! Please ?
JESSE: It 's illegal ! I could go to jail !
STORMIE: How will they ever know ? Do n't be such a pussy !
JESSE: Oh , yeah ? Why do n't you call then ?
STORMIE: Okay , I will !
MEAGAN: No ! They 'll never believe her !
STORMIE: I can disguise my voice Hello , how do you do ? My name is Jesse . I think I 'm a man but I 'm actually a wimp .
MEAGAN: They 'll never believe that . Come on , Jesse for me ?
JESSE: Okay okay I 'll do it . And I 'm not a wimp !
SECURITY GUARD: Springwood Mental Center how can I help you ?
JESSE: There 's a bomb planted in you uilding .
SECURITY GUARD: Who is this ?
JESSE: If I were you I 'd get my ass out of there .
SECURITY GUARD: Hey , Erwin where do you think you 're going ?
JESSE: He 's not going to make it .
MEAGAN: We 've got to do something !
ERWIN: Hi , my name 's Erwin . Thanks fo usting me out of there !
JESSE: Yeah , right Look , Erwin , just do me one favor do n't eat nothing disgusting . My stomach is tight enough as it is .
ERWIN: Damn ! We must have just missed them !
MEAGAN: Oh , my God she was here ! This is part of Lizzy 's shirt ! It 's all torn ! Erwin we 've got to find her !
ERWIN: We 're too late ! There 's no way except
MEAGAN: Except what ? !
ERWIN: We could go after Freddy .
MEAGAN: How ?
ERWIN: We 'll inject ourselves with Dream Dope . It 's a mild narcotic that ings on a dreamlike state .
MEAGAN: Okay let 's do it !
JESSE: Meagan we do n't do drugs ! I mean , what if one of us gets hooked o something ? We could turn out like him ! Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin .
ERWIN: Do n't worry about it . We need you wide awake anyway .
JESSE: What for ?
ERWIN: We 're going to go under and try to find Freddy . When we do , we 'll gra him and bring him here . Then you kill him with this Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver .
JESSE: This rusty chunk of shit ? What good is this ?
ERWIN: It 's not the gun , it 's what 's in it silver bullets blessed by a priest .
JESSE: Will that work ?
ERWIN: Should . But then
JESSE: You do n't make the rules yeah , yeah .
MEAGAN: What should we do ?
ERWIN: Have a seat over there and make yourselves comfortable . Roll up your sleeves and put these on
STORMIE: Oh , cool !
MEAGAN: What are they for ?
ERWIN: It 's how the cult keeps in constant contact with Freddy . The little lights flashing are a sustained occular input that causes your brain to resonate at approximately the same frequency at which the dream state is most likely to occur .
STORMIE: Whatever Put 'em on they 're really cool !
ERWIN: It helps to hold hands if you want to go together
LIZZY: Meagan help me please
ERWIN: Freddy 's trying to split us up
JESSE: Okay , Freddy there 's a new sheriff in Dreamland now .
FREDDY: Looking for some-body ?
STORMIE: I 've got him ! Wake us up ! Wake us up ! But Erwin is paralyzed with fear .
FREDDY: Hmmmmm I feel like seafood tonight .
STORMIE: Shoot him ! Shoot him !
FREDDY: Well , well , well if it is n't my ol ' pal , Erwin . Erwin stares wide-eyed , frozen to the spot .
STORMIE: You did n't help me , you pussy ! I could 've had him ! You gutless spinless jelly fish !
LIZZY: Meagan help me Meagan
MEAGAN: Daddy ? He looks up and quietly shushes her .
MEAGAN'S DAD: Shuuuuu ! I 'm trying to be invisible
LIZZY: Help me
STORMIE: Are you okay ? They help Meagan to her feet .
MEAGAN: He got away I had him and he got away . Oh , God Lizzy I lost her
ERWIN: Well , atleast you 're not dead .
MEAGAN: No I 'm not dead No I 'm not . But Freddy killed me !
STORMIE: He killed me , too . But look
MEAGAN: Now that I think about it he 's killed me in all my nightmares . But I 'm not dead what does it mean ?
ERWIN: It means we 've still got some time left . Until his remains are host to the Dream Demons Freddy ca n't hurt us .
JESSE: Hello . The Dream Demons ?
ERWIN: Freddy made a pact with Satan when he died so Satan bestowed upon him the Dream Demons . They 're the source of Freddy 's power to manipulate our physical reality . Without them he 's powerless nothing more than a bad dream . Hey , like I said I do n't make the rules .
MEAGAN: But we 've still got a chance , right ? A chance to kill Freddy before he gets back his power ?
ERWIN: We already tried that . There 's no way for us to kill Freddy . He 's too clever . He knows how to get to us .
MEAGAN: Then let 's get somebody else . Some- ody strong .
STORMIE: Yeah ! We could hire somebody to kill Freddy like a hit man !
ERWIN: You would have to hire a thousand of them or one really big guy who is n't afraid of anything . No fear . Nada . Then you got a shot .
JESSE: Where are you going to find a hit man ? The yellow pages ? In you dreams
MEAGAN: Jason
JESSE: Jason ?
MEAGAN: Jason Voorhees
ERWIN: Jason Voorhees that 's brilliant ! The perfect dream warrior no fear .
STORMIE: Sounds like our man !
JESSE: Uh excuse me , Einstein but is n't Jason Voorhees dead ?
ERWIN: Seriously dead . Buried up by Crystal Lake somewhere . But do n't worry , I know how to bring him back to life .
JESSE: Somehow I just knew you would .
ERWIN: But that 's not the problem . The problem is control . Once we bring Jason back from the dead I 'm not one hundred percent sure he 'll do what we tell him .
STORMIE: Well , that 's okay as long as he does n't chop us all up . Erwin rolls his eyes around uncertain .
MEAGAN: Erwin I 'm trusting you on this , so tell me the truth . Do you think if we do this if we go and get Jason and bring him back to life , that he could kill Freddy ?
ERWIN: No doubt about . Jason could wreck Freddy on this side of the Dreamline . But if Freddy has home court advan- tage I do n't know . Too close to call . The trick would be to get Jason to enter a dream state , grab Freddy , and drag him out to our reality .
MEAGAN: I have n't got a choice . I 've got to try something I ca n't ask either of you to help me do this it 's illegal , immoral , disgusting
STORMIE: Hey , we sisters have to stand together , right ? Where you lead I 'll follow . Count me in .
JESSE: Let me get this straight we 're going to go dig one dead maniac up to fight another dead maniac ?
ERWIN: That 's about the size of it and I 'd be doing you a disservice if I said there were n't a modicum of risk involved .
JESSE: Meagan I do n't want to do this
MEAGAN: You do n't have to , Jesse it 's not your fight . I understand .
JESSE: But I damn sure do n't want you to do it without me . Count me in .
ERWIN: Look out Freddy here we come .
NIGHT WATCHMAN: What 's matter , girl you hea somethin ' ?
CULTIST: That 's exactly what it is .
NIGHT WATCHMAN: Yeah ? Whose ?
CULTIST: Yours .
FREDDY: Smokin ' !
JESSE: We 're almost there
MEAGAN: We should pull over and ask directions .
STORMIE: If it does n't offend the men ooops , sorry ! There are n't any .
JESSE: Very funny .
STORMIE: I do n't think they 're open .
MEAGAN: It says , open all night . Jesse HONKS the horn and yells
JESSE: Hey ! Can we get some service out here ? !
STORMIE: I do n't think there 's anybody here
MEAGAN: We 're looking for the old cemetery that 's supposed to be around here somewhere .
STORMIE: We want to see it .
JESSE: Look , mister can you give us directions or not ?
STORMIE: Been dug up a few times already , has he ?
MEAGAN: Well , we 're just doing an article for our high school newspaper about the dangers of breaking into cemeteries at night . You know , stuff that can get you hurt
STORMIE: Where have you been ? Jason was that guy who ran around in a hockey mask , chopping up camp counselors , duh ?
MEAGAN: I knew that . What I mean was why ?
ERWIN: It started a long time ago , back in the fifties , when Jason drown at Camp Crystal Lake . His mother went erserk and started killing the counselors .
STORMIE: She got her head chopped off by one of the girls she was trying to kill !
ERWIN: Right . And then Jason came back from his watery grave to get revenge .
JESSE: He came back from the grave ?
ERWIN: Yeah . Chopped up a number of people efore they finally caught up to him .
MEAGAN: What happened to him then ?
ERWIN: They killed him .
JESSE: How can you kill somebody who 's ack from the grave ?
ERWIN: Not very well apparently . Jason keeps coming back to life and chopping people up . It 's a neve ending cycle of terror up here at Crystal Lake a real problem .
MEAGAN: Why does he keep coming back to life and killing people ?
ERWIN: They say he 's looking for revenge on the camp counselor who murdered him as a child . Jason just happens to go about it in the socially unacceptable way of hacking through every teenager he finds until he gets the right one . Here it is Erwin shines his light on Jason 's grave .
STORMIE: Get back , you nasty-ass bastard ! Ug ! I thought I had seen the last of those when my brother graduated third grade !
ERWIN: We just dug up a rotting corpse and you 're worried about a little snot .
MEAGAN: I 'm exhausted wake me when we get back home .
ERWIN: Uhhh better not fall asleep we 've still got a lot of work to do and Freddy 's out there waiting . This news sobers everyone up immediately .
STORMIE: Well , that means we 've all got to stay awake !
JESSE: Duh ? !
MEAGAN: I know ! We 'll sing a song ! Row ! Row ! Row your boat , gently down the stream . Merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily life is but a dream . Come on , everybody !
FREDDY: Should n't dream and drive .
MEAGAN: It 's Freddy !
ERWIN: Do n't worry an ambulance is on the way .
MEAGAN: Oh , God Jesse
ERWIN: Meagan listen to me The cops are on their way . If they find me and Jason Voorhees in the trunk there , we 're finished .
MEAGAN: Go get out of here . Take Jason and Stormie with you .
STORMIE: I 'm staying with you .
ERWIN: I 'll call you at the hospital .
STORMIE: How ?
ERWIN: Somehow !
MEAGAN: Is he going to be okay ?
DOCTOR: Yes . But he needs a lot of rest . His leg is broken in four places and he has four broken ribs and a concussion .
STORMIE: Hey doc , is there someplace I could get us something to eat ?
DOCTOR: I 'm afraid the cafeteria is closed . There are some vending machines in the lobby . I 'll be back to check on him in a couple of hours . The doctor exits .
STORMIE: I 'll be right back I 'm goin ' go score us some munchies .
MEAGAN: Jesse !
FREDDY: Okay , Sheriff This nightmare ai n't big enough for the two of us draw !
MEAGAN: Jesse ! Wake up ! Wake up ! ! Freddy looks over at her , annoyed .
FREDDY: Three 's a crowd , bitch ! Why do n't you just go get
MEAGAN: Jesse , wake up ! WAKE UP ! !
FREDDY: Go ahead make my dream ! Freddy FIRES !
MEAGAN: Freddy killed Jesse
STORMIE: Jesus get a grip , lady . You 'd think a nurse in a hospital would have seen a dead body before .
MEAGAN: Jesse
VOICE: Attention . Would Meagan or Stormie please pick up the white paging phone for a message ?
STORMIE: This is Stormie
MURDOCH: Did you see a couple of girls go y here a moment ago ? Stormie gestures to the elevators .

HOSPITAL OPERATOR: The message is from Erwin he says to meet him at the side entrance in two minutes .
STORMIE: Where 'd you get the truck ?
ERWIN: Same place I 've got Jason hid .

ERWIN: You 're a strong woman .
STORMIE: What 's that supposed to mean ?
ERWIN: Uhhh nothing . I did n't mean anything . Stormie gestures to the tarp .
STORMIE: Is this him ?
ERWIN: Yeah Meet the new and improved Jason .
STORMIE: Why 'd you put that stupid mask on him ?
ERWIN: Take a look
STORMIE: Good idea .
ERWIN: Not exactly a beauty queen entry , is he ?
STORMIE: So what do we do now sing an Ozzy Osbourne song backwards or something ?
ERWIN: I 'm afraid it 's not that simple
STORMIE: I thought you said you knew how to ing him back to life ?
ERWIN: I do ! But when I was putting him ack together , I noticed something was missing . Stormie thinks about this for a second , then
STORMIE: Awwww , he wo n't be needing that I mean , what girl would let him put his rotten ol '
ERWIN: No-no ! Not that ! It 's his heart it 's missing .
STORMIE: Well does it really matter ? Ca n't you use an aquarium pump o something ?
ERWIN: No he has to have a heart . A human heart . A good one . Meagan speaks for the first time
MEAGAN: I know where we can get a heart A good one .
ERWIN: That guard in there might pose a problem .
MEAGAN: Do you think you and Stormie could keep him occupied for a few minutes ?
STORMIE: Hey ! Watch that !
ERWIN: I 'm just trying to make it look real .
STORMIE: Just keep your hands above the bra , pizza face . The windows are starting to steam up .
MEAGAN: Forgive me , Jesse

MURDOCH: No that wo n't be necessary . I know just where they 're going , and just what they 're up to . And this time I 'll be ready .
STORMIE: You 've got to quit blaming your- self for what happened to Jesse it was n't your fault .
MEAGAN: He did n't want to come with us ut he did anyway . He did it for me .

MEAGAN: There 's no mistake . What did you do with Erwin ?
MURDOCH: Your boyfriend is headed back to the looney bin where he belongs . But do n't worry , you 'll be seeing him soon enough at the arraignment .
STORMIE: You do n't scare me , Freddy ! Thanks to my various phases and many hours of watching violent televison , I have become immune to violence . Seen it all and done it all ! Nothing you do can gross me out so why do n't you give it your best shot , bitch !

SIMONSON: You could n't burn a three-time loser with what you 're bringing in here . You know you stiffs could un yourselves an entrapment rap . The guy has done nothing Brooklyn is full of Candy Store guys with two cars who like to go to nightclubs .
RUSSO: Put this little candy hustle together with Joel Weinstock and it could be we stumbled into a big score .

LA VALLE: There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs , handling about a thousand vehicles a month . Those that are n't claimed are auctioned here once a month .
MARIE: Just for mistakes of parking ?
LA VALLE: No . Many are involved in crimes and confiscated or just abandoned . This is , as you know , your prime source of scrap metal , M. Charnier .
MARIE: Darling , may I have this one ?
CHARNIER: It would look even more lonesome in our garage .
AUCTIONEER: Every car sold today must be emoved at the purchaser 's own expense . We have no keys o anything to start the vehicles with . You buy 'em as you see 'em and where you see 'em . All right , the first car offered is Number 24398 . A Plymouth sedan . Do I hea fifteen dollars ?

LA VALLE: Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South . It was actually the first ailroad through New York City .
MARIE: Why is it called Hellgate ?
LA VALLE: The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast . Years ago , hundreds of ships went down here .
CHARNIER: If this bridge were in Europe , it would be on every tourist 's sight- seeing list .
LA VALLE: Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it .
CHARNIER: Look how gracefully they conceived that arch . Like a bowstring . It was built from both ends . With no support in the middle . Beautiful .
LA VALLE: Mmm .
MARIE: Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a idge as he can about a woman .
CHARNIER: Not any woman , Marie . Just one .
LA VALLE: I 'm afraid the rest of Ward 's Island is n't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant , a hospital , a training school for garbage men and that area over there , where the old cars are kept , prior to being processed for shipment to , among other places , The Charnier Shipping Company , of Marseilles , France .
MARIE: What is that old building ?
LA VALLE: Oh , it 's been abandoned for years .

Down goes Blackjack without even workin ' up a sweat and the whole Garden gets up in its feet and I swear to Christ , everybody starts singin ' `` Dance With Me Henry . ''
LEE: I fought a guy in Cleveland once . I knew he was a dirty fighter so I stick a crowbar in my crotch . Right here . Second round he gives me a shot Boom he breaks his hand , the fight 's over .

DOYLE: I do n't buy it . The stuff is on this car .
MECHANIC: Then you find it . I ca n't .
LA VALLE: The car was lost sometime this evening . First they send us to Pier One then they send us here
DESK SERGEANT: I do n't understand why you had it parked on the waterfront . You 're staying at the Doral and you lose your car somewhere out by the Brooklyn Bridge .
LA VALLE: In point of fact , M. Devereaux is scouting locations for a film fo French Television . He left the ca to look at some point of interest .
DEVEREAUX: We were told by the Police Commissioner 's office that the ca was brought to this garage . I demand its immediate return .
DESK SERGEANT: If you 'll be patient , Mr. Devereaux .
DEVEREAUX: I have been patient enough . There is no reason I should have to waste time with this red tape .
LA VALLE: Mr. Devereaux is an extremely important guest of this country . He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government . Here are his credentials from the French Consulate . Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his film I suggest you locate his car immediately .
MECHANIC: What are you looking for ? Is it as ig as an orange or an elephant 's ass ? I 've been over every inch top to bottom . If you could give me a club to the size
RUSSO: What was the weight of the car when you got it , Irv ?
MECHANIC: 4,839 pounds .
RUSSO: You 're sure ? The manufacturer 's spec says it should weigh 4,719 pounds . This one 's carrying roughly 120 extra pounds somewhere . He produces a copy of a ship 's manifold .
MECHANIC: I ripped everything out except the Rocker panels .
DEVEREAUX: What 's that ? They look at each other for a long moment .
RUSSO: Got it for you , Randy it just came in from downtown . Who 's Devereaux ?

DEVEREAUX: It is waiting for you in the garage .
CHARNIER: Did they follow you ?
DEVEREAUX: I was n't looking .
CHARNIER: Henri I need one more favor from you . I know I am imposing
DEVEREAUX: My friend , I am not sure about what is going on but for me , I am finished .
CHARNIER: Not quite you are in it whethe you like it or not . The police know you brought the car into the country . This makes you an accomplice .
DEVEREAUX: An accomplice to what ? ! What have you gotten me into , Alain ? You asked me to do you a favor and I did what you asked but you 've taken advantage of me . I have my eputation CHARNIER pulls DEVEREAUX further aside .
CHARNIER: Calm down Henri ! You must trust me this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you . It 's worth more money to you .

JACK: You just had some lucky shots .
BILL: Where 's Ned ?
ALICE: He went to bed early .
MARCIE: I do n't blame him .
BRENDA: He 's probably setting up another one of his practical jokes .
MARCIE: Yeah , like draining the lake !
JACK: Hey , how about a walk by the lake ?
MARCIE: Boy , we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here . Wait a minute , I 'll get my diaphragm and e right with you .

JACK: I do n't love Neddy .
MARCIE: He keeps on acting like such an asshole !

JACK: I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures . Ned is gon na do whatever he wants to do , you know .
MARCIE: I guess
JACK: Looks like a storm .
MARCIE: I 'm a little scared of storms . Always have been . Since I was a kid .
JACK: You ? The brick ?
MARCIE: I 've dreamed this dream . Maybe half a dozen times . There is a thunderstorm . The rain comes down like pebbles . I can hear the sound . I try to close my ears off . It does n't work . The sounds gets louder . The rain turns to blood and the lood washes down in little rivers . And the sound stops .
JACK: It 's just a dream .
MARCIE: I call it my shower dream .
JACK: This is no dream . Want to escape for a while ?
MARCIE: Lead the way !
JACK: Just a little . Wait a minute , woman .

BRENDA: You think they fell asleep ?
BILL: Anything 's possible . My parents taught me to leave sleeping lovers alone .
ALICE: It would n't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon . It would n't look so great if he fell over them .
BILL: Good point .
ALICE: Well , it has n't been that long .
BRENDA: Long enough for me .
ALICE: I think we should go wake them up . Just in case .
BRENDA: Give them a little while longer . It 's still early , anyway .
ALICE: I guess
BILL: Got to it just in time . The generato was running on fumes . I filled it up . That should keep it humming until Steve gets back .
BRENDA: Good night , Alice .
ALICE: Good night , Brenda .
BILL: Help you clean up ?
ALICE: Absolutely .
TIERNEY: I told you not to buy that hunk of junk !

BILL: I 'll go check on Brenda .
ALICE: Okay .
BILL: If it 'll make you feel better .
TIERNEY: Bad enough we got a full moon ; it 's Friday the 13th . They keep statistics . We get more accidents , more robberies , more rapes , more homicides , more of everything when there 's a full moon . It affects people . Makes 'em nuts .
STEVE: You 've made a science out of coincidence .
TIERNEY: This is Tierney .
STEVE: Sure . STEVE gets out quickly .
TIERNEY: Another coincidence .
STEVE: Yeah .

ALICE: No , no , they 're all dead
MRS. VOORHEES: I 'll go look .
ALICE: They 'll kill you ! Do n't leave me !
MRS. VOORHEES: I 'm not afraid .
ALICE: All dead ? Neddy ? Oh , Marcie ALICE stands close to the fireplace .
MRS. VOORHEES: Oh , my lord
ALICE: BillBillBill is out there
MRS. VOORHEES: We shall go straight to the police .
ALICE: The killer is still out there .
MRS. VOORHEES: I will protect you .
ALICE: Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy .
MRS. VOORHEES: No . That wo n't be necessary .
ALICE: I do n't understand .
MRS. VOORHEES: I am , Jason . I am .
ALICE: Why should n't we wait for Mr. Christy ?
MRS. VOORHEES: It was my son they killed . They said he drowned , but I know it was inadequate supervision
ALICE: Mr. Christy will be back soon .
MRS. VOORHEES: No , he wo n't . I killed him as well .
ALICE: I wo n't let you !
MRS. VOORHEES: I ca n't let them kill any more children . Come out now .
ALICE: Where are the goddamned bullets ?
JIM: Wellhow do you feel ?
SUZY: Ask me in about five minutes .
JIM: I 'm talking about graduation . Being totally free to do whatever we want now .
SUZY: It feels excellent .
JIM: Got ta throw the anchor over .
SUZY: What 's wrong ?
JIM: Nothing .
SUZY: C'mon , Jimmy . Something 's bothering you . Jim pauses , turning off the mood music .
JIM: It 's just that we 're right around that old summer camp where all those murders took place . The boat creaks . She 's instantly nervous .
SUZY: What murders ?
JIM: Never mind , you do n't want to know about it .
SUZY: Tell me .
JIM: There 's nothing to worry about , Suzy . The guy 's dead now , somewhere at the ottom of this lakeif you believe the stories . Let 's drop it , okay ? He starts to kiss her again . She stops him .
SUZY: What stories ?
JIM: There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who drowned in Crystal Lake
YOUNG JASON: Hhhhelp.me.I 'm drowning
JIM: A bunch of years went by and everybody forgot about it . That 's when the murders started .
SUZY: Jason did it ?
JIM': That 's what some people thought . But they were wrong .
JIM: His mother blamed the counselors fo his death and tried to kill them all . She got her head chopped off by one of them .
SUZY: So the murders stopped ? He gives her a long , penetrating look .
JIM: No .
SUZY: We 're the last graduating class , ight ?
JIM: Right .
SUZY: I mean , Lakeview High just closed its doors for good , right ?
JIM: Right .
SUZY: So there 's no reason for him to come ack because there wo n't be any of us aroundright ? Jim stops , looking her squarely in the eyes .
JIM: Right . Except that Jason is n't real so none of it matters anyway . She starts to relax , returning his kisses .
SUZY: Did you hear that ?
JIM: Hear what ? He pulls her back down .
SUZY: C'mon , I 'm serious . He knows the mood is broken .
JIM: All right , I 'll check it out .
SUZY: Jimmy ? No answer . Her heart starts to pound .
JIM: Gotcha good , baby cakes .
SUZY: And you 'll never do it again .
JIM: And I 'll never do it again . Forgive me ?
SUZY: No .
JIM: Uh-huh . You must really think I 'm an ass . But she continues to stare in horror as
JIM: Ohmygod
MCCULLOCH: Remember girls , the shuffleboard tournament will start at six p.m. sharp . A non-attendance will restrict your time in port , understood ?
MILES: You 're telling me this boat has a pool with a three meter board ?
SEAN: It 's a ship and that 's right . Plus a disco , gym , game room and a lot more .
MILES: I think I 'm gon na blow off New York and just stay on this thing .
MCCULLOCH: You 'll do no such thing , Mr. Wolfe
MILES: Of coursewould n't want to risk enjoying this trip .
SEAN: Which cabin is Rennie in , Mr. McCulloch ?
MCCULLOCH: Rennie 's not coming . He 's devastated .
SEAN: But I thought
MCCULLOCH: She changed her mind . Let 's seeMr . Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you , Mr. Robertson , are in two-twenty-five . A booming VOICE from above interrupts them
SEAN: Be right up , Dad .
RENNIE: Me too . But I 'm not sure Uncle Charles will be .

MCCULLOCH: You can stop right there , Miss Mason .
MCCULL40CH: Only graduating seniors are allowed on this cruise .
TAMARA: What are you talking about ?
MCCULLOCB: You never turned in your final biology project , so I 've had your diploma escinded .
TAMARA: You ca n't do that
MCCULLOCH: It 's already been done . Congratulations on the 3.9 average , Miss Watanabe . You 're in stateroom two- fifty-five .
TAMARA: Look , Mr. McCulloch , I got in a ca accident yesterday and missed ou appointment . It 's okay , no big deal , just a bruised arm so I brought my project along today . It 's in my suitcase . Really .
EVA: She 's telling the truth , Mr. McCulloch . I saw her pack it .
MCCULLOCH: All right . But if it mysteriously disappears en route , I 'll have you sent back home the minute we dock . Understood ?
TAMARA: Perfectly .
EVA: What are you going to do ?
TAMARA: Improvise , of course .

SEAN: Hello , Dad .
MILES: Hey , Admiral Robertson . Love you ship .
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: She 's a beauty , is n't she ? I should 've etired from the Navy ten years ago .
MILES: You 've really been generous to give us this cruise . I know I speak fo everybody on board .
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Hell , there 's just twenty or so of you we only need a skeleton crew and it 's a pleasure to sail her anyway . By the way , congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships , Miles . I 'm sure you made your old man proud .
CHIEF ENGINEER: Have you decided on your departure protocol , Admiral ?
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Actually , I thought I 'd leave the honors to my son .
SEAN: Dad , I do n't think
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Relinquishing command of the Princess Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson .
CHIEF ENGINEER: Have you decided on a plan of departure , Captain ?
SEAN: How about if we start up the forward engines and come around . 180 degrees
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Are n't you forgetting something ?
DECK HAND: This voyage is doomed .
SEAN: Yeah , tell me about it . Sean sidesteps him , moving on .
RENNIE: Hi , Sean .
SEAN: I heard you were n't coming .
RENNIE: We changed our minds .
SEAN: I got you a present .
RENNIE: But I did n't get you one
SEAN: Forget it . It 's a dumb little thing anyway .
RENNIE: Seanit 's beautiful .
SEAN: I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there , if you felt like it . It 's supposed to e 22 stories tall .
RENNIE: I 'd love to .
SEAN: I guess I 'll see you later .
MCCULLOCH: There 's a storm predicted tonight .
RENNIE: I 'm staying .
MCCULLOCH: If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of
RENNIE: She did n't push me into coming .
MCCULLOCH: Why are you doing this to yourself ?
RENNIE: I do n't even know why I 'm afraid , Uncle Charles . I ca n't even remembe when it started . Do n't you think it 's time I found out and got over it ? He takes a measured pause .
MCCULLOCH: Facing your fear does n't always conquer it .
RENNIE: I 'm staying . He 's not going to change her mind .
WAYNE: Too cool , J.J . Your parents came through .
RENNIE: What do you thinktime for some personal experiences to fuel ou minds ? The dog 's eyes blink , but no more than that .
EVA: I 'm not sure we 're supposed to be here , Tamara .
TAMARA: Is that a muscular bod or what ?
EVA: My parents are open minded about that sort of thing .
TAMARA: My stepmom could n't care less , but Daddy would have a shit fit . He might even pay some attention to me .
EVA: Sounds good . I hear there 's a shuffleboard court on deck it might e kinds cool
TAMARA: You 're joking , right ?
MCCULLOCH: Have you seen my niece anywhere ?
WAYNE: Yeah , motivating downstairs , I think . What 's the problem , Mr. McCulloch ?
MCCULLOCH: Senior predictions started five minutes ago and she has n't shown up .
WAYNE: Some of us do n't want our futures predicted .
MCCULLOCH: In your case I 'm sure that 's true . He brushes past Wayne angrily .
TAMARA: The night time is the right time . Tamara hands the straw to Eva .
EVA: No thanks .
TAMARA: What ? Do n't be a lightweightthis is top dollar toot .
EVA: It 's not that , it 's just that It I get caught , I 'll lose my science scholarship and everything .
TAMARA: You 're talking to the prom queen , Eva . Do you really think I 'm going to isk getting caught ?
EVA: I guess not .
TAMARA: Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now ? Come on , it 's grad night . You 've got your whole life to be uptight . Eva takes the straw .
TAMARA: Jesus , you scared the hell out of us .
RENNIE: Have you seen my dog ? I think he came this way .
TAMARA: No , we have n't . Care for a hit ?
RENNIE: No thanks . Rennie continues on . After she 's gone
TAMARA: A real space cadet . I wonder if she 'll narc on us
EVA: I have her in Creative Writing and she 's fairly nice .
TAMARA: Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice . Tamara puts the straw to her nose .
RENNIE: Toby ?
TAMARA: Oh yeah . Ready to party and then some .
MCCULLOCH: What are you doing in here ?
TAMARA: Nothing .
MCCULLOCH: Are you girls using drugs ?
EVA: Do you think I would use drugs , Mr. McCulloch ? We were just exploring the ship .
MCCULLOCH: I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes , Miss Mason . You 'd better have your biology project ready or I 'm phoning you parents .
TAMARA: They 're out of town .
MCCULLOCH: Then I 'll make sure you remain on oard while your classmates see the sights .
EVA: What are you going to do ?
TAMARA: Relax , I 've got McCulloch covered ut that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter . Rumor has it she 's a teensy bit afraid of the water
MILES: A half-twist short . I 'll hone that dive yet .
RENNIE: Have you seen my dog anywhere ?
RENNIE: Yeaha lot .
TAMARA: Wow , sorry
TAMARA: It was an accident , I swear
SEAN: What happened ? Rennie , are you okay ?
TAMARA: That was truly excellent .
EVA: Yeah .
TAMARA: Time to check out the waiters .
EVA: I think I 'll pass . See you later , okay ?
TAMARA: Butwait a minute !
RENNIE: I ca n't swim .
MCCULLOCH: Oh , I can see that . You 've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids , Miss Van Deusen .
RENNIE: It was n't her fault .
MCCULLOCH: Stay away from herboth of you .
DECK HAND: He 's come back and you 're all going to die .
RENNIE: Justleave me alone
MCCULLOCH: I 'm in no mood for any more stall tactics , Miss Mason . Where is you final project ?
TAMARA: Would n't you like a glass of champagne first , Charles ?
MCCULLOCH: Where did you get that alcohol ?
TAMARA: I packed it . Just for us .
MCCULLOCH: That 's it . You 're not setting foot off this ship until we return home .
TAMARA: But I have n't even shown you my iology project
MCCULLOCH: Oh , you 've done it now . Not only are you going home , I 'll see to it that you spend next year back in a high school classroom !
TAMARA: I do n't think so , Mr. McCulloch . Did you get anything good ? His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness .
WAYNE: Oh yeah .
MCCULLOCH: You 'll never get away with it . And you can forget about eve attending any film school . You 're both going to be very , very sorry .
TAMARA: Relax , Wayne . He wo n't risk doing a thing . Can I have the tape ?
WAYNE: This is going to sound supremely lamebut I 've had the major hots fo you since our sophomore year , Tamara .
TAMARA: That 's sweet , Wayne . Look , I 'd love to chat but I 'm really pressed for time . Let 's try to get together later , okey- doke ?
WAYNE: But I thought
TAMARA: Thanks for the camerawork .
WAYNE: Wayne , you 're an asshole . He despondently exits .
RENNIE: It 's not real , it 's not real
TAMARA: Pleaseplease do n't
SEAN: It 's okayyou 're going to be okay .
RENNIE: I want to go home . I want off this ship . After a moment
SEAN: Me too . Let 's go talk to my Dad .
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Let 's kick in the stablilizers , Mr. Carlson , and get the seas off the quarter . These kids are in for one hell of a storm .
CHIEF ENGINEER: Yes Sir . Activating comfort cruise mode .
CHIEF ENGINEER: Nineteen months .
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: A tremendous age . Take some advice from a salty old man do n't push him too hard .
CHIEF ENGINEER: This is the bridge . Approaching weather suggests we secure the main deck and
RENNIE: Can he really take us home ?
SEAN: Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for . But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you .
RENNIE: What about you ?
SEAN: If I go with you , he 'll neve speak to me again . But I 'm never going to live up to his expectations anywayso maybe it 's the right thing to do .
MCCULLOCH: I thought I told you to stay away from her .
MCCULLOCB: That 's a very good question and I 'd appreciate an answer .
WAYNE: Miles have you seen J.J. ? She was supposed to be jamming down in the power room but
JULIUS: What the fuck is this ? The others shrug , concerned .
RENNIE: What is happening ? ? ?
SEAN: I do n't knowwe 've gone off course or something
RENNIE: What do you mean ? ? ?
SEAN: I do n't know what I mean ! All 's I know is that there 's no one guiding this ship anymore
RENNIE: Ca n't you call for help ? ?
SEAN: I think so . But we have to lower the anchors so we do n't drift any further
RENNIE: Where are they ?
SEAN: The bowfront of the ship . There 's a hoist on each side that lowers them She starts to exit .
RENNIE: Just radio for help , okay ? ? ?
SEAN: Mayday , mayday , mayday
SEAN: Pleasecan anybody out there hea me ? ? No response . WAYNE and MILES rush in .
MILES: Sean , what 's going on ?
WAYNE: Jesus Christ
JULIUS: Who did this , man ?
WAYNE: Is the radio even working ? ?
MILES: Is n't there some international S.O.S . thing you can do ? ? ?
SEAN: Channel 16the distress frequency Mayday , mayday , maydaythis is the Princess Ruby . Please , somebody answer
MCCULLOCH: I demand to know what is going on
SEAN: It'sdead .
DECK HAND: You 're the last ones . He 's come back for you .
MCCULLOCH: What are you talking about ?
DECK HAND: Jason Voorhees .
MCCULLOCH: You 're insane , old man . Jason Voorhees has been dead for over thirty years .
DECK HAND: He walks this ship , here and now .
MCCULLOCH: A killer walks this ship indeed . And it 's certainly none of us
DECK HAND: You 're the one who 's insane ! !
MCCULLOCH: That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded It 's no coincidence .
JULIUS: Yeah , well these dead bodies are sure enough real . I say we regroup and find this motherfucker before he finds us . There 's a murmur ; it makes sense .
MCCULLOCH: You 'll do no.such thing and watch you mouth , young man ! I 'm in charge here ! They all look at McCulloch defiantly .
JULIUS: School 's out , McCulloch . Let 's go .
MCCULLOCH: Christwhere 's Rennie ? ?
SEAN: She'sshe 's dropping the anchors . I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if
MCCULLOCH: What ? ? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose ? ?
EVA: What 's going on ? I heard on the P.A . system that
WAYNE: The Captain 's been murdered . The buzz is that Jason might be on board .
EVA: JasonVoorhees ?
WAYNE: No . And I 'm not losing any sleep ove it .
EVA: But she might be in trouble
WAYNE: So what else is new ? Look Eva , you 're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason . Wise up it 's not hip to be her friend .
EVA: I do n't care about being hip anymore . She means it . Wayne nods with understanding .
WAYNE: I 'm sorry , but I 've got ta find J.J . He hurries on .
RENNIE: Toby ?
EVA: Tamara ?
EVA: Tamara ? I just want to talk with you .
RENNIE: Toby ? Where 'd you go ?
MCCULLOCH: You had me worried to death !
RENNIE: But Sean said
MCCULLOCH: I 'm the one you should be listening to ! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever ?
JULIUS: I managed to scrounge this shit from the game room and hallways . Grab what you want .
WAYNE: What are you taking , Julius ?
JULIUS: Nothin ' .
WAYNE: We 're talking the possibility of Jason Voorhees here . Julius pauses . He 's not stupid .
JULIUS: Nothin ' but this gun .
RENNIE: Ca n't we at least talk about it ?
MCCULLOCH: I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship .
RENNIE: But what about the drowning boy I 've een seeing ?
MCCULLOCH: Whatever you 've beenimagining has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees . I want you to be safe , Rennie . That 's all I care about .
RENNIE: I 'm not staying in my room , Uncle Charles .
MCCULLOCH: This is n't a request .
WAYNE: J.J. you down here ?
SEAN: I do n't know .
MCCULLOCH: She 's locked safe in her room , no thanks to either of you . Has he brought it back on course yet ?
SEAN: It workedwe 're back on course !
MCCULLOCH: What 's that ?
SEAN: The fire alarm
MCCULLOCH: Can you shut that damn thing off ? ?
MCCULIACH: There 's only one person who needs to see it . And I 'm going to find him .
MCCULLOCH: I doubt very much that one even exists .
SEAN: We have to get everybody together just in case the fire 's for real . Sean heads for the door , shoving it forward .
MILES: I 'll take the upper deck .
JULIUS: Miles ? ?
YOUNG JASON: Hhhhelp me.I 'm drowning
YOUNG RENNIE: Hhhhelp.me .
SEAN: Rennie ? ?
RENNIE: The window
SEAN: It 's gon na be okay
RENNIE: What is it ? ?
SEAN: The power room
SEAN: Rule one , do n't panic . Rule two , assess the damage and act accordingly
RENNIE: Is the ship going to sink ? ?
SEAN: I do n't know .
RENNIE: I 'm not going near any lifeboat !
SEAN: But Rennie
RENNIE: I 'm not ! !
MCCULLOCH: Rennie ? ?
SEAN: Water has gotten to the engines . We have to get everybody off this ship
MCCULLOCH: What did you do with Rennie ? ?
SEAN: This is Jason 's fault !
MCCULLOCH: Not another word , do you hear me ? ?
SEAN: We have to get off this ship ! !
MCCULLOCH: Get in the boat , Rennie !
RENNIE: II ca n't
MCCULLOCH: You can and you will ! !
SEAN: Stop it ! !
RENNIE: Toby
SEAN: Come onfaster .
SEAN: Start rowing ! !
MCCULLOCH: If we do n't find the shore soon we 're all going to die .
JULIUS: Hey man , if I can make it , so can . you . Sean slowly nods , turning on the calculator .
RENNIE: No ! ! !
MCCULLOCH: Come on everybody up the ladder .
MCCULLOCH: A wonderful choice of places to dock a oat , Mr. Robertson .
RENNIE: No !
JULIUS: We ca n't let those gang-bangers get away , man
MCCULLOCH: You heard him ! We have to call the police
RENNIE: Please do n't
JULIUS: Use the combos and keep the feet light
SEAN: Renniewhat 'd they do to you ? ?
RENNIE: Drugs Then Jason came . He 's here , Sean . Oh Jesus . He never expected this .
SEAN: We have to find the others . Together they run off .

JERRY: Do you ? Really ? When did you take your last confession ?
CHARLIE: Get back
JERRY: That 's a mighty big cross you have there . Question is do you actually know how to use it ?
JANE: Leave my kid alone .
CHARLIE: Mom !

COP #2: Hit and run . Happens all the time . Charlie stifles his surprise . Nods .
AMY: We wo n't stay up all night . Bee and Cara need help with Trig it 's not a party . Okay . Okay
CHARLIE: Like what ? A vampire moved next door , borrowed some beer , ate a stripper and then blew up our house ecause we would n't invite him in ? Amy looks at him .
AMY: Okay . The DOCTOR approaches .
DOCTOR: You should get some rest .
CHARLIE: She 's going to wake up , right ?
DOCTOR: Assuming the swelling is minimal , I hope so .
CHARLIE: But you do n't know .
DOCTOR: Not yet . We need to give it time .
ASSISTANT: Bye babe . Good show tonight . He 's barely paying attention .
PETER: You were late again on `` The Devil 's Torture Chamber . '' But she 's gone .
CHARLIE: This is my fault .
AMY: You did n't make any of it happen .
CHARLIE: Ed came to me . I turned my back on him .
AMY: How were you supposed to believe him ? None of it makes sense .
CHARLIE: He did talk a lot of demented crap . He was my best friend . He asked me , begged me , to believe him .
AMY: People change . Everybody
CHARLIE: Yeah they do . I turned into a dick . I figured my dweeb past , not ig with the ladies .
WRY: So you 're saying this is my fault .
CHARLIE: I wanted you to like me . I tried to erase Ed all of it . I know how that feels .
AMY: I knew you were a dweeb . You think I want a `` dude '' like Mark or Ben ? I like that you 're different It did n't hurt that your skin cleared up .
AMY: No , seriously . I 'm going to die a virgin ? Me ? How did this happen ?
CHARLIE: We 're not going to die
AMY: But what if we do ? Let 's do it . Now . The bathroom . Charlie . A beat .
CHARLIE: I think we should kill the vampire first . I 'll perform much better . They laugh trying not to cry . Then

PETER: I can help you . My place . One hour .
AMY: The Peter Vincent ?
CHARLIE: Under-whelming , believe me . But he 's what we 've got .
CLOSE ON: A MIDORI cocktail
PETER: I 'll tell you what I know , but that 's it . Do n't expect me to join your Scooby gang .
CHARLIE: Anything . I 'll take it .
PETER: I found the origin of that insignia you showed me . It 's a species that originated in the Mediterranean . They nest in the earth explains that hole you saw . And they kill slowly , keep their victims alive for days .
GRIM: `` Snackers . ''
CHARLIE: So they turn all of them ? Make their victims into vampires .
AMY: I know . I read .
PETER: No . It takes a while before they complete the change . They usually finish them off before that .
AMY: So how do you kill these guys , this `` tribe '' ?
PETER: Usual stuff . But it 's a strong eed . You need a plan
TO CHARLIE: I order things when I 've had a few cocktails . It 's a
ALARMED: Wait . You get deliveries this late ?
PETER: I do n't know . Maybe Charlie stands .

AMY: Oh my God , oh my God Amy 's starting to lose it . Charlie grabs her .
CHARLIE: Look at me . Stop .
SHE DOES: There 's another way out of here . And there are a million things to fight with in here . Understand ? We 're going to make it . Amy pulls herself together . Nods . They RUN .
ED: Give it up , Chuck ! You 're dead .
THEN: If you had n't ended up such a dick , I might have tricked you out . We could have rocked this evil shit ! But you blew it . Nothing but the ig dirt nap for you and your lady .
GUARD: Sign in , please .
JERRY: I know where I 'm going .
GUARD: Sign in . No exceptions .
ED: I expected more of a fight . Girl 's made you lazy in the head . Pussy 'll do that .
ARTHUR: .I have kids
ED: Had .
ED: Mano eone mano . Piece of cake . Cause I 'm a God Damned killing machine , and you 're like all the Clark High big shots nothing .
THEN: You picked the wrong side , man .
CHARLIE: I did n't pick
ED: You did n't think . Charlie 's wrecked about what he has to do .
CHARLIE: I know . I 'm sorry .
ED: Steeeerike ! Call that a swing , Slugger ?

AMY: Vampires . She RUNS .
ED: Bone is a motherfucker , Chuckles . Hard to cut .
AMY: Do it . Charlie ! Charlie 's frozen .

AMY: I found the stairs . Come on .
AMY: Stop . Stop , I need to
CHARLIE: Not now . He 's coming for us .
AMY: He ca n't kill us , not here
CHARLIE: Who 's going to notice ? Who 's going to care ? Amy , look around
AMY: Oh , God
CHARLIE: Keep moving . Come on .
DJ: Tequila Man t-shirts ! Yeeeeeahhhh ! The crowd goes nuts , SURGES forward
AMY: Charlie !

JERRY: Holding her with a firm grip .
AMY: No . No !
GUY: Go get her , man !
AMY: Help me ! Help ! !
AMY: Charlie 's coming , he 'll find me
JERRY: I 'm counting on it .
CHARLIE: Amy ! No ! BAM ! A hand falls on his shoulder .
DOORMAN: How 'd you get in here ?
CHARLIE: You have to help me . That guy , he 's going to kill her , he 's a
DOORMAN: Yeah ? Then she 's liking it .
CHARLIE: You do n't understand !
DOORMAN: ID . Then you can tell me you whole sad story
CHARLIE: No ! There 's no time Amy ! !
JERRY: Sees that CHARLIE is restrained .
PETER: How 'd you get in here ?
CHARLIE: Security 's a little lax . Everybody got their throat ripped out . Peter backs away as Charlie moves in .
PETER: You too ? He change you ?
CHARLIE: Look at your monitor .
COLD: I 'm going to end him , or he 's going to end me .
PETER: Do n't you get what this is ? There 's no fighting . There 's only surviving , if you 're lucky
CHARLIE: You call this surviving ? If you live and we all die , you think you 'll ever be able to get us out of your head ?
PETER: I know I wo n't . I never could not after the first time . This stops Charlie .
CHARLIE: Made what up ?
PETER: The vampire who killed my parents , my brothers . But not me . I hid .
CHARLIE: So do it . We 'll go in at dawn . He 's got to rest sometime
HARD: It 's not like that . When I was a kid , I hid because I wanted to live . I still do ! This is n't the comics . You want to be a dead hero . Good for you . But I 'm out .
CHARLIE: So you bail on people , erase them .
THEN: I do n't want to make it to tomorrow , not if you 're the kind of man I have to be .
PETER: Wait .
PETER: Who knows what 's for real any more .
CHARLIE: I 'll figure it out .
PETER: No , you need a plan . To stake him , you have to get close he 's stronger than you .
CHARLIE: Holy water ?
PETER: Slow him down . Wo n't stop him .
THEN: Torch him , you 'll have a few good minutes before he really goes up . Believe me , a vampire on fire is n't thinking clearly .
CHARLIE: But if he 's on fire , how do I get close enough to stake him ? A beat .
PETER: Fuck .
NOT DEAD: Then I have to get him on the opes .
STORE GUY: Good for you .
CHARLIE: Let 's do this shit . He swallows hard , scared but determined .
AMY: Amy slowwwwly gets up , turns

CHARLIE: How do you feel ?
AMY: I 'll survive . Please get out of here . He 's too strong
CHARLIE: I 'm stronger .
WAVERING: In a nerd power way . You know
CHARLIE: Shit ! You
PETER CHARLIE: Sorry How 'd you A beat . Then
PETER: Guess I do n't want to be a man like me either .
PETER: Do n't get greedy . I 'm here .

CHARLIE: We have to find Amy . She was in a oom upstairs , then she just disappeared . This house
PETER: What do you mean she `` disappeared ? ''
CHARLIE: She was there . I looked away , looked back she was gone . Peter takes this in .
PETER: Show me where .
CHARLIE: Where does it go ?
PETER: Only one way to find out .
CHARLIE: Wait you 're going in ?
PETER: See that ? Like a great date . Get me drunk and I 'll try anything .

PETER: How about we go back to my `` run away '' plan ?
IGNORING HIM: We ca n't burn Jerry out . There 's no way we 'll get all these people out if the house goes up .
PETER: I thought you 're here for Amy . Great . Right . Save the Geometry
JERRY: You look bigger on TV . Peter fires the shotgun , BLAM !
CHARLIE: Amy , God She clings to him , near tears .
AMY: Charlie .
AMY: You should have run with me while we had the chance . You should have saved me , Charlie .
CHARLIE: It 's not too late .
AMY: It is . He 's inside me now .
JERRY: It 's over , guy . Charlie his girl 's having her way with him .
THEN: She 's way out of his league anyway .
PETER: Stop ! Stop !
JERRY: And your aim
PETER: You do n't get it ! I 'm on you side .
AMY: You would n't .
CHARLIE: Try me .
AMY: I 'll be the best you ever had . The only you had .
THEN: Charlie . We can be togethe forever . She leans in , licks his neck seductively
CHARLIE: I know . He backs away from her . Into
ADAM: Dude !
CHARLIE: Sorry .
JERRY: I 'll finish this . Jerry , all swagger , moves in on Charlie .
PETER: Worth a shot . `` Master of illusion . ''
TO CHARLIE: You think that 's going to stop me ? Time to man up .
PETER: Fuck .
TO JERRY: Fuck yeah ! Nice sweater , loser !
WEAK: I 'm better with stationary targets .
CHARLIE: Yeah you are . Peter looks at him , sad .
PETER: Get out of here . We do n't have much time before they dig out .
PETER: You 're a brave mother , I get it . And you were right . This is how I had to go But we did n't count on an army .
CHARLIE: He 'll kill you both , he said
PETER: We 're already dead .
THEN: Go now , you live to fight anothe day . Stay there wo n't be one . Charlie stops . Swayed . Pained .
AMY: Charlie !
CHARLIE: Blow me ? Seriously ? Peter falls back exhausted . Laughing .
MS. GRANADA: Let 's agree to never talk about this .
JANE: Think you 'll ever feel the same about a nighttime sky ?
PETER: Same as what ? I was always terrified .
JANE: Right . We 're just catching up .
CHARLIE: I 'm not seeing that .
AMY: She deserves some fun . Your mom fully cheated death .

AMY: Right .
THEN: Frak ?
PETER: Frak ! Right on .
TO AMY: Perfect Woman , can I get you a drink ?
AMY: I 'll take another . Thanks .
TO PETER: I 'll give you a hand .
PETER: It 's dark . I 'm on the `` day '' wagon .
CHARLIE: Thanks for inviting us .
PETER: We should celebrate . Being alive . Your mom 's clean bill of health .
CHARLIE: You wanted to put the moves on her .
PETER: What ? No . What ?
CHARLIE: Just I 'm watching you . I 've got to look out for her .
PETER: Yeah you do . So here 's what I 'm thinking . We faced the beast and we won . Can you imagine the possibilities if we had got that shit on film ?
PETER: Show up on film , yeah . But werewolves do , bigfoots do . We get proof , catch something we could uild a stage act around that , you would n't believe . We 'd blow those Cirque bitches away !
CHARLIE: An act ? Seriously ? What about saving people from evil ? What

CHARLEY: Amy , I 'm serious .
AMY: So am I . Do you want to make love o not ?
CHARLEY: Amy , quick , come-here , you 've got to see this .
CHARLEY: Okay , maybe it was n't a coffin , but I did see two guys carrying something into that house
HARDLY LISTENING: I do n't understand you . First you want to make love , then you do n't
JUDY: Have you two been having a lovers ' spat ?
JUDY: Well , there 's nothing wrong with that . Right here it says the divorce rate is 76 % higher among couples who do n't argue before marriage .
JUDY: Oh , yes , that 's right . Well it never hurts to-plan ahead .
TO AMY: Tell your mother I said hello , will you , Amy . And remind her we 're playing bridge at her house this week . I 'm bringing the cheesepuffs , she 's making the dessert .

JUDY I: Did n't I tell you ? Bob Hopkins told me he finally sold the place .
CHARLEY: To who ?
JUDY: I.d.o n't know . Some fellow who fikes up houses , he said . Supposed to be attractive , too . Anyway I just hope whoever he is , he knows what he 's getting into with that house . It 's going to take a lot of work just to make it liveable
CHARLEY: The bastard . Why did n't he tell us he was going to spring a pop quiz ?
EVIL ED: That 's the point to a pop quiz , Brewster . To surprise you .
CHARLEY: Hey , Amy
EVIL ED: What 's wrong ? She finally found out what you 're really like ?
CHARLEY: Buzz off , Evil .
EVIL ED: Call me anything you want . Only you 're the one failing Algebra , not me .
GIRL: Is this ninety-nine Oak ?

AMY: God , I 'm so glad we 're getting this straightened out .
AMY: Charley , are-you listening to me ?
EVIL ED: Know what I heard on the police band .last night ?
CHARLEY: What ?
EVIL ED: That was n't the only murder . It 's the second in two days .
GLEEFULLY: And get this . Both of 'em had thei heads cut off . Can you believe it ?
CHARLEY': You 're sick . A voice suddenly comes from behind him .
CHARLEY: Morn , you 've yot to get up . I ca n't elieve what s happening next door .
JUDY: ( staring up as her son
SLEEPILY: What , what are you talking about ?
CHARLEY: He has fangs . The man who bought the house has fanas !
JUDY: Oh , Charley , I have to be at work at
JERRY: Here , you forgot this .
JUDY: Charley !
JUDY: Here , drink this..
AS HELL: Mom , I do n't need hot cocoa . I did n't have a nightmare . They did kill a girl over there .
JUDY: Charley , how late did you stay up studying ?
CHARLEY: iMom , I 'm not sick . The guy did have ` fangs and a bat did fly over my head .and then Jerry Dandrige stepped out of the shadows . You know what that means , do n't you ?
JUDY: What ? .
CHARLEY: He 's a vam_re !
JUDY: ( .staring at him
INCREDULOUSLY: A what ?
AMY: A what ?
CHARLEY: ( frustrated as hell
AGAIN: A vampire , damnit ! Have n't you listened to anything I 've said ?
AMY: Charley , is this some kind of trick to get me 'back ?
CHARLEY: i Forget it , L 'm going to the police .
AMY: Charley , you ca n't go to the police with a story like that . They 'll lock you up .
CHARLEY: All right , then I wo n't tell them it 's a vampire . But I sure as hell am going to tell them about the two women
LENNOX: You sure about this now ?
BILLY: Yes .
LT. LENNOX: Mr. Dandrige ?
BILLY ': No , I 'm his roommate , â€¢Billy Cole .
LT. LENNOX: Lieutenant Lennox , homicide . Mind if we come in ?
BILLY: No , not at all .
LIEUT. .LENNOX: There was a murder last night . Charley lives'next door and thinks he saw the victim in this house .
SEEMINGLY SHOCKED: That 's impossible . I was here with Jerry all last night . There was nobody else in the house .
CHARLEY: That 's a lie . I saw him carry her body out in a plastic bag .
LIEUT. LENNOX: What do you say to that , Mr. Cole ?
RELIEVED: The kid 's crazy , officer . I did take some bags out last night , but they were full of trash . Here , let me show you
BILLY: See . We 're just in the process of moving in
CHARLEY,: The bag I saw had a body in it , not trash .
BILLY: Did you actually see the body , Charley ?
CHARLEY: No , but .
TO LENNOX: Look , let me take you out back . I'.11 show you the bags I '' put in the garbage .
LT. LENNOX: Okay , let 's see 'em
CHARLEY: Look , I can prove he 's lying . Let 's look in the basement instead .
LT. LENNOX: What 's down there ?
BILLY: ( turning and staring
CHARLEY: A coffin , that 's what 's down there , a coffin . I saw them carry it in !
TAKEN ABACK: What ?
CHARLEY: Lieutenant Lennox , please , listen to
CHARLEY: Evil !
EVIL ED: And to what do I owe this dubious pleasure ?
CHARLEY: The vampire knows that I know about him . Or at least he will when he wakes up tonight .
EVIL ED: What are you talking about ?
HE'S CRAZY: What ?
CHARLEY: Look , Evil , I have n't got time to explain . Just tell me what to do to .protect myself .
EVIL ED: ( going back to his
CHARLEY: I 'm not kidding . Evil , please , just tell me what to do .
EVIL ED: Why should I help you ? And do n't call me that .
CHARLEY: ( digging money out of
HIS POCKET: Look , I 've got eight bucks . Tell me what ' to do and it s yours .
EVIL ED: Far be it from me to turn down a fool 's money . Where and when do you expect this vampire to attack ?
CHARLEY: In my bedroom . Tonight .
EVIL ED: Start with this . Of course , you have to have faith for it to work . Then get some wolfbane
CHARLEY: What ?
EVIL ED: Forget it . Get some garlic , links of the stuff you can wear around you neck and hang from your window . If he comes for you , , that 'll be the way . Then , of course , there 's holy water . But you need a priest to say a blessing over it first .
CHARLEY: That 's all ?
EVIL ED: ' I 'm afraid so . Of course , they can change into wolves and bats at will and I do n't know what you do about that . But your best protection right now is that a vampire ca n't ente your house without being invited by the rightful owner first .
CHARLEY: You sure about that ?
EVIL ED: Positive .
CHARLEY: Yeah , Mom
JUDY: Charley , this is.our next doo neighbor , Jerry Dandrige .
JERRY: Hello , Charley . Charley just stares at him .
JUDY: Well , shake hands , Charley . There 's no reason to be rude .
JUDY: ( rising and smiling
AT JERRY: I invited him over for a drink .
CHARLEY: You what ?
JUDY: ( a bit taken aback by the intensity of he
SON'S REACTION: Invited him over . Why ?
JERRY: What 's wrong , Charley ? Afraid I 'd never come over without being invited first ? You 're quite right . But , of course , now that I 've been made welcome , I 'll probably drop by quite a bit .
WITH HIM: Of course , Jerry . You 're welcome anytime . It 's so nice someone interesting has finally moved into the neighborhood . It 's so dull around here . I mean how many nights can you play Trivial Pursuit ? Right , Jerry ?
JUDY: Charley , . are you all right ?
CHARLEY: Yeah , fine . I 've just got to get back to my trigonometry , that 's . all .
JERRY: Nice meeting you , Charley . ( his voice suddenly dripping with double
ENTENDRE: See you soon .
JUDY: You know , our town really isn't'as oring as I make it sound . Fo instance , there 's a dance at the church the first Friday of every month .
EVIL ED: Yeah .
EVIL ED: No shit ?
CHARLEY: Ed , this is serious !
CHARLEY: Yeah , and I nailed my.window shut .
EVIL ED: Positive . Now good night . I 've got some studying to do .
JERRY: Now we would n't want to wake you mother , would we , Charley ?
SMILING: Then I 'd have to kill her , too . Right ?
JERRY: You deserve to die , boy
JUDY: Charley , what happened ?
THINKING FAST: I , I just had a nightmare .
INSTANTLY CONCERNED: Oh , no . You know , I had one last night . I was at this White Sale and there I was , standing at the counter , and I reached for my credit cards only to realize I was naked as the day I was born
JUDY: Now what 's that ?
CHARLEY: Nothing , Mom . Just the raccoons in the garbage again . Why do n't you go back to sleep . ,
JUDY: But what about your nightmare ? Do you want a valium ?
CHARLEY: I 'm fine now , honest . Night .
JUDY: Well , I do needy sleep . I start the night shift tomorrow , you know .
CBARLEY: Yes , Nom , I know . Now , good night .
JERRY: I just destroyed your car , Charley . But-it 's nothing compared to what I 'm going to do to you tomorrow night .
DRAMATIC PAUSE: Now , watch me do it
CHARLEY: Get him , Peter , . get him
CHARLEY: Hey , Mr. Vincent
PETER: All right , what do you want me to sign ?
CONFUSED: Pardon me ?
PETER: Well , you want my autograph , do n't you ?
CHARLEY: No , sir . I was curious about what you said last night on TV . You know , about elieving in vampires .
PETER: What about it ?
CHARLEY: Were you serious ?
PETER: Absolutely . Unfortunately none of your generation seems to be .
CHARLEY: What do you mean ?
PETER: That I have been fired because no one wants to see vampire killers anymore . Or vampires either . Apparently all they want are demented madmen running around in ski masks hacking up young virgins . Now if'you 'll excuse me
CHARLEY: i believe in vampires .
HARDLY LISTENING: That 's nice . If only there had been more of you perhaps my rating would have been higher. ,
CHARLEY: In fact I have one living next door . Would you help me kill him ?
PETER: Pardon me ?
CHARLEY: You know the murder of that girl that happened yesterday ?
PETER: Yes .
CHARLEY: Well , the'guy who lives next door did it and he 's a vampire . A moment . Then Peter turns away angrily .
PETER: If this is your idea of a joke , I am not amused .
GRABBING HIM: Mr. Vincent , I 'm not joking . I 'm deadly serious .
CHARLEY: But , Mr. Vincent , I 'm telling the
CHARLEY: You just said you believe in
SHARPLY: I ' lied . Now leave me alone .
CHARLEY: Please , you have to listen to me . The vampire tried to kill me last night-and trashed mv car when he did n't succeed . He 'll be coming back for me tonight and if I do n't get help , he 's going to kill me
CHARLEY: Mr. Vincent
AMY: What are you doing here ?
EVIL ED: Me ? What about you ? I thought you just dumped him .
AMY: What I 'm doing here is-none of you usiness .
EVIL ED: Aha , you do like him !
AMY: Anybody home ?
STARING AROUND: What 's all this for ?
CHARLEY: Self-defense . Not that I think I 'll need it . He 'll be dead before nightfall .
AMY: Who will be ?
CHARLEY: Dandrige . I 'm waiting for the guy he lives with to leave , then I 'm doing to go next door , find his coffin , and pound this through his heart .
AMY: That 's murder , Charley .
CHARLEY: You ca n't murder a vampire , Amy . They 're already dead , remember .
AMY: Charley , you 're acting crazy .
CHARLEY: I do n't have any choice , Amy . The police wo n't listen to me , .my mothe thinks I 'm crazy , you two , even Pete Vincent thinks I 'm nuts .
SHOCKED AGAIN: You actually went to Peter Vincent ?
NODDING: Yeah . Dandrige has got to be stopped . Listen . I just taped this .
CEARLEY: See . After he attacked me last night he went out and had his dinner . No , I- do n't have any choice . Somebody has to stop him . Hold.on , I need
EVIL ED: What are we going to do ? if we do n't stop him he 's actually going to try to kill this guy .
REALLY HORRIFIED: With a stake through the heart !
AMY: I know , I know
EVIL ED: I do n't believe this . It 's like Fright Night .
AMY: That 's it !
EVIL ED: ( shocked by the
SUGGESTION: How are we going to do that ?
AMY: I don't-know , but we better figure out a way if we do n't want to be visiting Charley in jail .
THROAT: Charley , .it 's going to be dangerous doing into that house alone , is n't it ?
CHARLEY NODS: You 're going to need all the help you can get , right ? Somebody like Peter Vincent for instance .
CHARLEY: I told you , I already tried him .
AMY: Why not let us try before you do anything ?
CHARLEY: Why should he believe you anymore than he did me ?
AMY: Maybe we 're better talkers .
CHARLEY: Fat chance .
AMY: What happens if you go into that house alone and he gets you ? Who 's going to stop him then ?
JOINING IN: Yeah , then he 'll be able to suck his way through this entire town . Not that it would-be much of a loss .
SLOWLY: I do n't know
AMY: Charley , it 'll be dark soon . You do n't want to go into- '' that house then , do you ?
CHARLEY: No , you 're right there .
FINALLY: All right , try him again..
RISING: Great . Now , you promise you wo n't do anything till .you hear from us ? Come . on
AMY: ( she stops , turning
BACK: You do n't believe me , do you ?
SLOWLY: I love you. , Charley . She turns and hurries out of the room .
PETER: Yes .
AMY: Could we talk to you for a moment , Mr. Vincent ?
Â€¢ PETER: I 'm afraid now is n't the best time
AMY: Please . It 's terribly important .
PETER: Now what ' can I do for you ? An autograph or an interview for you school newspaper ?
AMY: I 'm afraid this is much more . important .
FROWNING: Oh , really ?
AMY: I know you 're a very busy man , Mr. Vincent , but we 're trying to save a oy 's life .
HURUMPHING: Well , yes , I see , where that could be more important . Would you care to explain yourself ?
STEPPING IN: You remember a fruitcake kid named Charley Brewster . He said he came to see you ?
PETER': No .
AMY: He 's the one who thinks a vampire is living next door .
SMILING: Oh , yes . He 's insane . Dear me , I hope he 's not a friend of yours ?
MALICIOUSLY: She 's got the hots for the creep .
AMY: We need your help ' to stop him , Mr. Vincent . You see , he really does elieve his next 'door neighbor is a vampire . Re 's planning to kill him .
GLEEFULLY: Yeah , with a stake through the heart . 'Peter stares at them for a moment .
PETER: Are you two serious ? My dear , your friend needs a psychiatrist , not ' a vampire killer .
BEGGING: Please , Mr. Vincent .
PETER: I 'm afraid not , my dear . You see , Hollywood beckons . I 've een offered a starring role in a major movie . I 've even had to quit Fright Night . So you see , I 'm
.AMY: I 'll hire you . I 'll give you money .
PETER: How much ?
AMY: I have a five hundred dollar savings
PETER: I 'll take it . Now how are we going to cure you little friend of this delusion ?
EVIL ED: I got it all figured out . We all go next door to the neighbor and you run some kind of vampire test on-him and pronounce-him human . Like in `` Orgy of the Damned . '' You know , where you looked in the mirror and the guy did n't have a reflection and then you knew he was a vampire .
CONFIDENTLY: Leave that to me
BILLY: Yes .
BILLY: It 's for you . Jerry takes it .
JERRY: Yes .
HE LISTENS: Yes , this is Jerry Dandrige . I see . Yes , of course , I 'm always willing to help young people . But Vm afraid crosses would n't do . You see , I 've been reborn recently . He smiles at Billy ; Billy smiles back .
EVIL ED: He 's a reborn Christian . He thinks crosses would be sacrilegious .
PETER: Ask him how he feels-about holy water ?
EVIL ED: How about holy water ? ( he listens , then back
TO PETER: Wo n't do either .
PETER: Tell him it'll-be just ordinary tap water and all he has to do is take a sip . Evil Ed turns back to the phone .
JERRY: Yes , that sounds fine . Only do n't come over till six tomorrow .
PAUSE: I 'll be out until then . He slowly hangs up and turns to Billy .
JERRY: It seems we wo n't have to go out tonight after all . His friends are inging him over tomorrow night .
PAUSE: To prove to him that I 'm not a vampire . Billy smiles . So does Jerry .
CHARLEY: Who is it ?
AMY: Charley , Peter Vincent said he 'd come .
CHARLEY: He did . When ?
AMY: Tomorrow at six .
SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED: But Dandrige will be out of his coffin y then .
EVIL ED,: Relax , he 's Peter Vincent , the Great Vampire Killer . He must know what he 's doing , right ?
GETTING PARANOID: I do n't know . Maybe.he did n't take it
LYING MIGHTILY: Oh , he did , Charley , he did .
CHARLEY: Honest ?
NODDING SOLEMNLY: Honest .
SLOWLY: Then maybe we it really have a chance to kill Dandrige tomorrow night . You two do n't know what it 's been like , knowing there 's a vampire living next door and having no one believe me
SOOTHINGLY: It 's all right , Charley
CHARLEY: 'It 's six ten . He said he 'd be here at six , right ?
EVIL ED: Relax . He said he 'd be here , he 'll e here .
AMY: Here he comes . The kids rush the car as Peter pulls up .
CHARLEY: Mr. Vincent , I ca n't tell you how much I appreciate this
PETER: Charley Brewster , I presume ? Peter Vincent , vampire killer . And now down to business . Where is the lair of this suspected creature of the night ?
CHARLEY: ( pointing at the
DANDRIGE HOUSE: There .
STUDYING IT: Ah , yes , I see what you mean . There is a distinct possibility .
PETER: Well , shall we ?
CHARLEY: Where 're your stakes and hammer ?
HORRIFIED: You 're not going in there without them ?
PETER: I have to prove he 's a vampire before I kill him , Charley .
CHARLEY: But I know he 's a vampire .
PETER: But I am the one that has to know , Charley . This is holy water . If it touches him , he 'll blister- and in this case I asked him to drink it while we all watched . He readily agreed .
SHOCKED: He did ?
PETER: Yes . Which does n't exactly strengthen your case , does it ? Now , shall we go .
CHARLEY: But , Mr. Vincent , if I 'm right and you prove he 's a vampire , he 'll kill us all right then and there .
PETER: No , he wo n't , Charley . Not with me here to protect you . After all , I 'm Peter Vincent.. ' -
CHARLEY,: But , Mr. Vincent , you do n't know how powerful he is . He can change into a at and fly through the night
PETER: Of course , Charley , of course . But then he 's never dealt with me before either .
BILLY: Mr. Vincent , Billy Cole . This is a pleasure . Wo n't you all come .in ?
PETER: Perhaps he did n't hear you .
SMILING: Oh , he heard me all right .
JERRY: Ah , Mr. Vincent . ( shaking Peter 's hand
WARMLY: I 've seen all your films and I 've .found them very amusing .
OBVIOUSLY PLEASED: Why , thank you
JERRY: And who might these two attractive people be ?
PETER: This is Ed Thompson and Amy Peterson .
JERRY: Charmed . Is n't that what vampires are supposed to do , Charley ?
AMY: God , he 's neat .
EVIL ED: Some vampire , Brewster .
I I: You 'll have to excuse the mess . I 'm still unpacking
SMILING: It 's all right , Mr. Vincent . I 'm quite used to it by , now . As you may or may not know , Charley even brought the police over a few days ago .
AMY: Charley , you did n't .
ANGRILY: Damn right , I did ; Only the cops .did n't believe me anymore than any of you . But you 'll believe me in a few seconds . Mr. Vincent , give him the holy water .
WARNING HIM: Charley , there 's no reason to be rude about this
PETER: It 's perfectly all right , Mr. Vincent . Where is the , ah , holy water ?
JERRY: Are you sure that 's holy water , Mr. Vincent ?
PETER: Positive . I saw Father Scanlon bless it down at Saint Mary 's myself .
CHARLEY: Get ready to run . I 'll protect you with this .
JERRY: There , satisfied ?
PETER: Totally .
TO CHARLEY: Charley , you saw it . Are you convinced now that Mr. Dandrige is n't a vampire ?
CHARLEY: But , it ca n't be
PETER: You just saw it , Charley . You know as well as I do that no vampire could drink blessed water .
CHARLEY: Then it was n't blessed !
HUFF ILY: Are you calling me a liar , young man ?
CHARLEY: If he 's not a vampire , then have him touch this ?
PETER: Charley , you 've already made a fool of yourself once . There 's no reason to compound the error .
_ JERRY: Yes , Charley , you 've already.caused your friends quite enough pain . ( his eyes burning into Charley , hammering the
CHARLEY: No , no , of course not. ,
JERRY: And you 're finally-convinced I 'm not a vampire either , -correct ?
CHARLEY: Yes .
JERRY: Well , I 'm glad that 's all.settled .
JERRY: I ca n't tell you how much I. appreciate this , Mr. Vincent . You 've een a great help .
AMY: I 'd , I 'd like that , Mr. Dandrige .
JERRY: Please , call me Jerry .
CHARLEY: C'mon , let 's get out of here
AMY: ( pulling away from him , her gaze neve
LEAVING DANDRIGE: Just a minute , Charley
JERRY: The same goes for you , .Ed I suspect we have many of the same interests . You know , in such things as horro movies and the occult .
PETER: No , no , just my clumsiness . Come along , we must be going . Thank you again , Mr. Dandrige
CHARLEY: What 's wrong with you ?
PETER: Nothing .
CHARLEY: Then why are your hands shaking ?
PETER: They're- not shaking .
CHARLEY: You saw something in there , did n't you , something that convinced you he was a vampire ?
PETER: Will you be quiet .
CHARLEY: Is Jerry Dandrige a vampire or not ?
PETER: No , of course not .
CHARLEY: Please , Mr. Vincent , you have to tell me . Our lives depend on it .
PETER: All right . He did n't cast a eflection in my mirror . Satisfied now ?
CHARLEY: Mr. Vincent , you have to call the Polic e-and tell them
JERRY: I could teach her so much
BILLY: What ?
JERRY: Nothing .
BILLY: Well , at least they 'll neve elieve the kid now .
JERRY: No ?
RISING: Let 's go .
CHARLEY: Well , at least you two heard him .
EVIL ED: Probably just a trick of the light .
CHARLEY: You felt how evil Dandrige was , did n't you , Amy ? Remember the way he looked at you ?
AMY: ( confused by the
MEMORIES: Yes , sort of
EVIL ED: Oh , for Christ sake He turns , about to duck between two houses .
CHARLEY: Where are you going ?
EVIL ED: Rome . It 's dinner time .
CHARLEY: Wait a minute . We walk Amy home first .
EVIL ED: Why ?
CHARLEY: Because it 's after dark , pencil.dick , and there 's a vampire back there !
EVIL ED: Oh , shit , Brewster , you 're certifiable , you know that .
EVIL ED: .Let 's cut through here .
CHARLEY: No way . We want people and lights , the more the better .
EVIL ED: Look , Brewster , vampires do n't exist . Have n't you gotten that through your thick head yet ?
CHARLEY: What if you 're wrong , Evil ? What if Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks you know it . Would you walk down that alley then ?
EVIL ED: Aw , fuck you , Brewster .
CHARLEY: Ed , please , just stick with us .
EVIL ED: Forget it . You may be chickenshit , ut I 'm not .
AMY: What do we ' do ? ..
CHARLEY Â€¢: Let him go . No vampire 's gon na want hint anyway.. Probably give him blood poisoning .
CHARLEY: Where is he ? Amy spots him laying crumpled against a wall .
AMY: Over here .
CHARLEY: Ed , Ed , are you all right ? Nothing from Evil Ed . Charley looks at Amy .
EVIL ED: He got me , Charley . He bit me . ( grabbing him by

EQUALLY SCARED: What else could it be 7

MCGRAW: Hot goddamn day !
PETE: Have n't felt it a bit . Been inside with the air conditioner blastin ' all day long .
MCGRAW: Not even for lunch ?
PETE: I 'm by myself today , ate my lunch outta the microwave .
MCGRAW: Jesus Christ man , that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet . Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed . Pull me down a ottle of Jack Daniels . I 'm gettin ' tanked tonight .
PETE: Whatsamatter ?
MCGRAW: Awww , it 's just been a shitass day . Every inch of it hot and miserable . First off , Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick , so that Mongoloid oy of hers was workin ' the grill . That fuckin ' idiot do n't know rat shit from Rice Krispies . I ate breakfast at nine , was pukin ' up pigs in a lanket like a sick dog by ten thirty .
PETE: Is n't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public ?
MCGRAW: Well , if there ai n't there sure oughta e. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid 's mind ?
PETE: You could sue the shit out of her , ya know . That kid belongs under a circus tent , not flippin ' burgers . You could own that fuckin ' place .
MCGRAW: What the hell would I do with that grease pit ? Besides , Nadine 's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head . Then all this Abilene shit happened . You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene , did n't ya ?
PETE: That 's all that 's been on the box all day . They killed some people did n't they ?
MCGRAW: Four Rangers , three cops , and two civilians . And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage . Pete does n't say anything .
PETE: Knock yourself out .
SETH: Letting him use your toilet ? No store does that .
PETE: He comes in here every day and we ullshit . He 's used my toilet a thousand times . If I told him no , he 'd know something was up .
SETH: I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here , in his car , and down the road o you can change the name of this place to `` Benny 's World of Blood . ''
PETE: What ? Are you kidding ? I did n't do anything !
SETH: He says you were scratching .
PETE: I was n't scratching !
SETH: You callin ' him a liar ? Pete controls himself .
PETE: I 'm not calling him a liar , okay ? I 'm simply saying that if I was scratching , and if I did scratch , it 's not because I was signaling the cop , it 's because I 'm fuckin ' scared shitless .
RICHARD: The Ranger 's taking a piss . Why do n't I just go in there , blow his head off and get outta here .
PETE: Do n't do that ! Look , you asked me to act natural , and I 'm acting as natural in fact , under the circumstances , I think I ought get a fuckin ' Academy Award for how natural I 'm acting . You asked me to get rid of him , I 'm doing my best .
SETH: Yeah , well , your best better get a helluva lot fuckin ' better , or you 're gon na feel a helluva fuckin ' lot worse . The toilet FLUSHES .
MCGRAW: Yeah , and I 'm gon na be right back at it tomorrow . So tonight I 'm gon na sit in front of the box and just drink ooze . How much is the bottle ?
PETE: Six-fifty .
SETH: What the fuck was that about ?
RICHARD: He signaled the Ranger .

RICHARD: Gotcha !
SETH: One Two Three .

RICHARD: Seth , I 'm telling you , the way he looked at us you especially I knew he knew .
SETH: Low profile . Do you know what the words `` low profile '' mean ?
FORT STOCKTON: 238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER
JACOB: We got about two more hours of day light left . That 'll get us into El Paso , which is right next to the order . We 'll stop at a motel
SCOTT: Stop ? We 're not going to actually stop at a motel , are we ?
JACOB: Okay , Okay , maybe I was a little overzealous , but give me a break , I just bought it . Scott and Kate continue the impersonation .
SCOTT: Why , just look at all this . You got your kitchen
KATE: you got your microwave
SCOTT: you got your sink
KATE: you got your shower
SCOTT: see this , television !
KATE: Feel this , real wood paneling . That 's eal wood , too , not that fake stuff .
JACOB: Unless you two wiseacres wan na be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking , what say we drop this ?
SCOTT: The truth hurts .
KATE: It 's the bitterest of pills .
JACOB: You two ought to start a stand-up act , because you 're just wasting you humor on me .
KATE: Ai n't it the truth .
SCOTT: Why do you want to stop ?
JACOB: I 'm exhausted .
SCOTT: Lie in the back , Dad , I 'll drive us into Mexico .
JACOB: I just bet you would . Do n't even thin about it . Besides , I want to have one night 's sleep in an honest-to-goodness bed . The beds in the home are okay , but they 're not like a real bed .
KATE: Hey , if we go to a motel , we can swim .
SCOTT: I 'll be right back . I 'm gon na go to the bathroom .
KATE: Dad , when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist . Mr.Franklin said he would n't permanently replace you until we came back . He said when we come home , if you still feel the same way
JACOB: That 's very nice of Ted , but I 'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting .
KATE: I did n't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset . But you do n't believe in God anymore ?
JACOB: Not enough to be a pastor . Look , I know this is hard on you kids . Afte Jenny 's death , this is probably the last thing you need . But I ca n't do it any longer . My congregation needs spiritual leadership . Well , they ca n't get that from me anymore . My faith is gone . To answer your question , yes , I do believe in Jesus . But do I love them ? No . After Jenny died , I just thought , what 's the point ?
KATE: It 's just , all our lives you 've been a pastor . For twenty years you 've preached trust in the lord . And then one day you wake up and say fuck him ?
JACOB: I did n't say fuck him . I 'm just not connected anymore .
KATE: That happens , you 'll get it back .
JACOB: Kate , give your old man a little credit . Every person who chooses the service of God as their life 's work has something in common . I do n't care if you 're a preacher , a priest , a nun , a rabbi or a Buddhist monk . Many , many times during your life you 'll look at your reflection in the mirro and ask yourself , am I a fool ? We 've all done it . I 'm not going through a lapse . What I 've experienced is close to awakening . I 'm not trying to shake your faith . I 've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore .
KATE: What do you think Mom would say ?
JACOB: Mom 's got nothing to say , she 's dead .
SETH: Whatcha think I want , ya mean old astard ? I wan na room .
RICHARD: Do they have cable ?
SETH: No .
RICHARD: Do they have an X-rated channel ?
SETH: No .
RICHARD: Do they have a waterbed ?
SETH: They do n't have anything except fou walls and a roof , and that 's all we need .
HOSTAGE: What are you planning on doing with
SETH: I said plant yourself . Plants do n't talk . You wan na get on my good side ? Just sit still and do n't make a peep . She shuts up .
RICHARD: How ya think , it hurts like a son-of-a-bitch .
SETH: I got both rooms on either side of us , so we do n't got ta worry about eavesdropping assholes . How 's that feel ? You okay ?
RICHARD: Feels good .
SETH: I 'm gon na go get the money . He heads for the door .
HOSTAGE: About seven .
SETH: Good . I 'm going towards the border to check things out while it 's still daylight . Call Carlos and arrange the endezvous .
RICHARD: Hey , when you talk to him , see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent .
SETH: That 's their standard deal , brother . They ai n't about to change it for us .
RICHARD: Did you even to try to negotiate ?
SETH: These guys ai n't spic fire cracke salesman from Tijuana . They do n't even know the meaning of the word `` barter '' . You wan na stay in El Ray ? You give them thirty percent of your loot . It 's scripture . So it is written , so shall it be done . You want sanctuary , you pay the price , and the price is thirty percent .
RICHARD: All I 'm saying
SETH: This conversation is over .
HOSTAGE: Gloria . He shakes her hand .
SETH: Hello , Gloria , I 'm Seth and that 's my other Richie . Let 's cut to the chase . I 'm gon na ask you a question and all I want is a yes or no answer . Do you want to live through this ?
GLORIA: Yes .
SETH: Good . Then let me explain the house ules . Follow the rules , we 'll get along like a house on fire . Rule numbe one No noise , no question . You make a noise Mr. 45 makes a noise . You ask a question , Mr. 45 answers it . Now are you absolutely , positively clear about ule number one ?
GLORIA: Yes .
SETH: Rule number two You do what we say , when we say it . If you do n't , see rule number one .
RICHARD: Wan na come up here on the bed and watch TV with me ? You can tell she does n't want to . He pats the empty space next to him .
SETH: Things are real hot here . Crossing 's gon na be a bitch . Do n't worry , we 'll get across . But when we do , where do we go ? Can we make it as close to the borde as possible ? Texas wants our balls . The quicker we 're in your protection , the better I 'll feel . Okay , where ? The Titty Twister ? I love it already . Okay , Carlos , I 'll see you and your men at the `` Titty Twister '' tomorrow morning . Bye , my friend .
EL PASO: 5 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER CUT TO
KELLY HOUGE: This bloody crime spree started just a week ago today . The oldest of the two others
DEATH TOLL: 13
KELLY HOUGE: That changes the death toll to fifteen . Five Texas Rangers Eight police officers Three civilians .
STANLEY CHASE: For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours . The Bureau , local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko .
KELLY HOUGE: Agent Chase , does it appear that they are heading for Mexico .
STANLEY CHASE: Yes , it does , Kelly . We have already alerted the Mexican authorities . They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice .
KELLY HOUGE: Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene , Gloria Hill ?
STANLEY CHASE: We 've received no news one way or the other . We can only hope for the best .
KELLY HOUGE: What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot ?
STANLEY CHASE: This ca n't be confirmed at this time , ut we do believe it to be true . We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard , and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store 's clerk .
KELLY HOUGE: Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers , that the Bureau , the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally ?
STANLEY CHASE: I would say that 's a very safe assumption .
RICHARD: Is it safe to assume since the law enforcement authorities in the great state of Texas are homosexuals of a sick and deviate nature , that they will be too busy fucking each othe up the ass to actually catch The Gecko Brothers ? I would say that 's a very safe assumption .
CASPER: Would you play with me ? A big burly COP turns around .
COP: Sure , little boy A GHOST ! ! ! The cop heads for the hills . Casper cries .
RICHARD: Shit , I started to get worried . Where the fuck ya been ?
SETH: Sight seein ' .
RICHARD: What 'd ya see ?
SETH: Cops .
RICHARD: Didya look at the border ?
SETH: Yeah , I saw the border . Through inoculars from on top of a high uilding . That 's about as close as I isked getting . What 's the TV say ?
RICHARD: They 're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours . Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer .
SETH: I got ta figure a way to get across that goddamn border . Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ai n't worth a shit .
RICHARD: Look , fuck the border . Let 's just dig in and wait for things to cool down .
SETH: Richie , it 's gon na get a lot fuckin ' worse before it gets any fuckin ' etter . We showed our ass in Texas . We killed Texas fuckin ' Rangers . They ai n't gon na stop lookin ' till they find us , and when they find us , they 're gon na kill us . Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers . The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us .
RICHARD: How do you know ?
SETH: I heard it on the radio . We got ta get our asses into Mexico tonight . Carlos is gon na meet us tomorrow morning at a endezvous on the other side , then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and Seth stops talking and looks around .
RICHARD: What ? Seth 's out of his chair .
SETH: What 'd ya mean , what ? The fuckin ' woman , the hostage . Where the fuck is she , Richard ! ?
RICHARD: She 's in the other room .
SETH: What the fuck is she doin ' there ? ! He goes to the door of the adjoining room .
RICHARD: Seth , before you open the door , let me explain what happened .
SETH: Oh , Richard , what 's wrong with you ? Richard rises from the bed .
RICHARD: Now , Seth , before you flip out , let me just explain what happened .
SETH: Yeah , explain it to me . I need an explanation . What 's the matter with you ?
RICHARD: There 's nothing wrong with me , other . That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do .
SETH: No . That woman would n't of said shit if she had a mouthful .
RICHARD: Wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong ! Once you left , she ecame a whole different person .
SETH: Is it me ? Is it my fault ?
RICHARD: It 's not your fault , it 's her fault !
SETH: Is this my fault ? Do you think this is what I am ?
RICHARD: What ?
SETH: This is not me ! I am a professional fucking thief . I steal money . You try to stop me , god help you . But I do n't kill people I do n't have to , and I do n't rape women . What you doin ' ai n't how it 's done . Do you understand ?
RICHARD: Seth , if you were me
SETH: Just say yes ! Nothing else , just say yes .
RICHARD: Yes .
SETH: Yes , Seth , I understand .
RICHARD: Yes , Seth , I understand . Seth hugs his little brother . Tight .
SETH: We get into Mexico , it 's gon na be sweet Rosemary , hundred-proof liquor , and rice and beans . None of this shit 's gon na matter .
KATE: I ca n't believe he 's stopping here . This place looks totally cruddy .
JACOB: There 's nothing wrong with this place .
KATE: It 's a flop house .
JACOB: It 's not a flop house . It 's basic and simple . That does n't make it a flop house .
KATE: If it does n't have a pool , we 're looking for a new place .
JACOB: It has a bed . That 's all I care about .
KATE: Other places have beds , they also have cable TV , a gym , room service
JACOB: Watch where you 're going !
SCOTT: What 's this guy 's problem ?
JACOB: I have no idea .
KATE: Creepy guy .
JACOB: What ?
RICHARD: Hi there , I 'm from room 9 , my name is Don Cornelius . No , not the Don Cornelius from Soul Train . Me and my lady friend need some ice and we do n't seem to have an ice bucket . Could we possibly borrow yours ? I 'll bring it ight back .
JACOB: Sure .
SETH: It 's called a punch .
RICHARD: Sit down . Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat .
SETH: What 's your name ?
JACOB: Jacob .
SETH: Okay , Jacob , get up and sit your ass down on the bed . Make a wrong move and I 'll shoot you in the face . Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed .
RICHARD: Upsy daisy . guiding him over to the bed by his father .
SETH: What 's the story with you two ? You a couple of fags ?
JACOB: He 's my son .
SETH: How does that happen ? You do n't look Japanese .
JACOB: Neither does he . He looks Vietnamese .
SETH: Oh , well , excuse me all to hell .
JACOB: What 's this about , money ?
SETH: It 's about money , all right , but not yours . You see , me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance .
KATE: What 's going on ?
RICHARD: We 're having a wet bikini contest , and you just won .
JACOB: It 's okay , honey . Everything 's going to be all right .
SETH: Just listen to daddy , sugar , and do n't do nothin ' stupid . You two , Simon says sit the fuck down ! They slowly sit .
JACOB: On the dresser .
SETH: Richie , take the keys . Start that big astard up , and drive it up front .
KATE: Richie , will you do me a favor and eat my pussy ?
RICHARD: Sure .
SETH: Not when you get around to it , now .
KATE: Yes .
SETH: Do you believe me ?
KATE: Yes .
SETH: You damn well better . Go . She goes into the bathroom .
JACOB: Look , if you want the motor home , just take it and get out .
SETH: Sorry , Pops , it ai n't gon na be that easy . We hear the motor home `` HONK '' twice outside .
JACOB: Not a chance .
SETH: Come again ?
JACOB: If you 're taking people , take me . But my kids are n't going anywhere with you .
SETH: Sorry , I need everybody .
JACOB: My children are not going with you , and that 's that .
SETH: That 's not fuckin ' that this is fuckin ' this . Go sit over there .
JACOB: Yes .
SETH: Good . Your old man 's all right , he just saved your life . Seth BANGS on the bathroom door .
KATE: Excuse me . Richard zeros in on her .
RICHARD: What ?
KATE: Where are you taking us ?
RICHARD: Mexico .
KATE: What 's in Mexico ?
RICHARD: Mexicans . He does n't smile .
SETH: Jacob Fuller . Jacob , that 's biblical , ai n't it ? What am I askin ' for , of course it is . What are their names ?
JACOB: Scott and Kate .
SETH: Scott and Kate Kate and Scott Scott Fuller Kate Fuller
JACOB: My wife .
SETH: Where is the little lady ?
JACOB: In heaven .
SETH: She 's dead ?
JACOB: Yes , she is .
SETH: How 'd she die ?
JACOB: Auto wreck .
SETH: Come on , gim me some more details . How 'd it happen ? Some fuckin ' drunk kill her ?
JACOB: No . It was a rainy night , the brakes on the car were n't great . She had to stop suddenly . She slid on the road , she crashed , she died .
SETH: Died instantly ?
JACOB: Not quite . She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on .
SETH: Whewww ! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off , do n't they ?
JACOB: Yes , they do .
SETH: Is this real ?
JACOB: Yes .
SETH: I 've seen one of these before . A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion . Away to fuck the IRS . Is that what you 're doing , or are you the real McCoy ?
JACOB: Real McCoy .
SETH: You 're a preacher ?
JACOB: I was a minister .
SETH: Was ? As in not anymore ?
JACOB: Yes .
SETH: Why 'd ya quit ?
JACOB: I think I 've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I 'm gon na get . Now if you need me like I think you need me , you 're not gon na kill me 'cause I wo n't answer your stupid , prying questions . So , with all due espect , mind your own business .
SETH: I seem to have touched a nerve . Do n't e so sensitive , Pops , let 's keep this friendly . But you 're right , enough with the getting to know you shit . Now , there 's two ways we can play this hand . One way is me and you go round an ' round all fuckin ' night . The othe way , is we reach some sort of an understanding . Now , if we go down that first path at the end of the day , I 'll win . But we go down the second , we 'll oth win . Now , I do n't give a rat 's ass about you or your fuckin ' family . Y'all can live forever or die this second and I do n't care which . The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back , and our money . And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico . Now , stop me if I 'm wrong , but I take it you do n't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice , o the bank getting its money back . Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter , your son and possibly yourself . Am I correct ?
JACOB: Yes .
SETH: I thought so . You help us get across the border without incident , stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny , and in the morning we 'll let you and your family go . That way everybody gets what they want . You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico . Everybody 's happy .
JACOB: How do I know you 'll keep your word ?
SETH: Jesus Christ , Pops , do n't start with this shit .
JACOB: You want me to sit here and be passive . The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I elieve you 'll let us go . I 'm not there yet . You have to convince me you 're telling the truth .
SETH: Look , dickhead , the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you 're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters . I do n't wan na hafta worry about you all fuckin ' night . And I do n't think you wan na be worrying about my brother 's intentions toward your daughter all night . You notice the way he looked at her , did n't ya ?
JACOB: Yes .
SETH: Did n't like it , did ya ?
JACOB: No , I did n't .
SETH: Did n't think so . So , as I was saying , I 'm willing to make a deal . You ehave , get us into Mexico , and do n't try to escape . I 'll keep my brothe off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning .
JACOB: You wo n't let him touch her ?
SETH: I can handle Richie , do n't worry .
JACOB: If he touches her , I 'll kill him . I do n't give a fuck how many guns you have , nothing will stop me from killing him .
SETH: Fair enough . You break your word , I 'll kill all of you . Kate , honey !
KATE: Yeah .
SETH: You must have a bible in here , do n't cha ?
KATE: Yeah , we got a bible .
SETH: Get it and bring it up here , will ya , please ?
JACOB: I swear to God I wo n't try to escape and I 'll do my best to get you into Mexico .
SETH: You best better get it done , Pops . Seth places his hand on the Bible .
RICHARD: Did ya mean what you said back there ? Kate turns to him .
KATE: What ?
RICHARD: In the room . Were you serious , or were you just foolin ' around ? I 'm just inging it up , 'cause if you really want me to do that for you , I will .
KATE: Do what ?
RICHARD: What you said to me in the room .
KATE: What did I say ?
RICHARD: You asked me if I would
SETH: I told you to watch those kids , I did n't say
RICHARD: We 'll talk later . Kate still has n't a clue what he means .
SETH: Okay everybody , it 's show time . Richie , take Kate in the bathroom .
JACOB: I 'm telling you , do n't hurt her .
SETH: As long as you 're cool , she 'll be cool . What 're ya gon na say ?
JACOB: I do n't have the slightest idea .
SETH: Well , you just keep thinkin ' of that gun next to Kate 's temple .
SCOTT: What are you gon na do ?
JACOB: I 'm gon na try and get us across the order .
SCOTT: No , dad , you got ta tell 'em that they 're back there . Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this .
RICHARD: This is n't gon na work .
SETH: Shut up . It 's gon na work just fine ,
RICHARD: I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea .
SETH: Duly noted . Now , shut up .
RICHARD: They 're gon na search the van .
SETH: As long as you do n't act like a fuckin ' nut , we 'll be just fine .
RICHARD: What does that mean ?
SETH: What ?
RICHARD: You just called me a fuckin ' nut .
SETH: No , I did n't .
RICHARD: Yes , you did . You said as long as I do n't act like a fuckin ' nut , implying that I 've been acting like a fuckin ' nut .
SETH: Take a pill , kid . I just meant stay cool .
RICHARD: You meant that , but you meant the other , too .
SETH: This ai n't the time , Richard .
RICHARD: Fuck those spic pigs ! You called me a fuckin ' nut , and where I come from , that stops the train on its tracks .
SETH: Keep your voice down .
RICHARD: Or what ?
JACOB: Have you forgotten about your sister ?
SCOTT: They 're gon na kill us . They get us across the border , they 're gon na take us out in the desert and shoot us .
JACOB: If they get over the border , they 're gon na let us go .
SCOTT: Dad , I watch those reality shows . They never let anybody go . Any cop will tell you , in a situation like this , you get a chance , you go for it . This is our chance .
JACOB: What about Kate ?
SCOTT: They 're gon na kill her anyway . At least now with all these cops we 've got a fighting chance .
JACOB: Son , I have this situation unde control . I know exactly what I 'm doing . You 're going to have to trust me on this .
SCOTT: If trusting you means trusting those fuckin ' killers , I ca n't do that . If you do n't tell the cops , I will .
JACOB: Now , you listen to me . You ai n't gon na do a goddamn fucking thing , you hea me ! Nobody cares what you think , I 'm unning this show , I make the decisions .
SCOTT: He 's running the show .
JACOB: I 'm running the show . I make the plays , and you back the plays I make . Stop thinking with your fucking alls . Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ai n't the time to `` go for it . '' I need your cover . Cover my ass . There 's a HONK behind them .
BORDER GUARD: How many with you ?
JACOB: Just my son and I .
BORDER GUARD: What is your purpose in Mexico ?
JACOB: Vacation . I 'm taking him to see his first bullfight .
RICHARD: I 'm curious . What was the nuttiest thing I did ?
SETH: This ai n't the time .
RICHARD: Oh , I know , was it possibly when you ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out ? Yeah , you 're right , that was pretty fuckin ' nutty . Not to mention stupid . But you know what ? I can fix that right now .
BORDER GUARD: What was that ?
JACOB: Oh , that 's just my daughter in the athroom .
BORDER GUARD: You said it was just you and your son .
JACOB: I meant me , my son and my daughter .
BORDER GUARD: Open the door . I 'm coming aboard .

JACOB: Then ?
SETH: Then stop , 'cause that 's where we 're going .
RICHARD: Yeah , I think so . What happened ?
SETH: I do n't know , you just passed out .

SETH: Okay , troops , this is the homestretch . Here 's the deal ; this place closes at dawn . Carlos is gon na meet us here sometime before dawn . Which by my guesstimate is somewhere between three or four hours from now . So we 're gon na go in there , take a seat , have a drink have a bunch of drinks , and wait for Carlos . That could be an hour , that could be three hours , I do n't know which . But when he gets here , me and Richie are going to leave with him .

SETH: What do you mean ?
RICHARD: Where are you ?
SETH: I 'm here with you .
RICHARD: No , you 're not . You 're sippin ' margaritas in El Ray . But we 're not in El Ray . We 're here getting ready to go in there . You 're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico , you think the job 's down . It ai n't . Get back on the clock . That 's a fuck-with-you-bar . We hang around there for a coupla hours , in all likelihood , we 'll get fucked with . So get your shit together , brother .
SETH: My shit is together .
RICHARD: It do n't look together .
SETH: Well , it is . Just because I 'm happy does n't mean I 'm on vacation . You 're just not used to seein ' me happy , 'cause it 's been about fifteen fuckin ' years since I been happy . But my shit is forever together . Richard believes Seth 's response .
RICHARD: Okay , just checkin ' .
CHET: Take advantage of our penny pussy sale . Buy any piece of pussy a tour regula price , you get another piece of pussy , of equal or lesser value , for a penny . Now try and beat pussy for a penny ! If you can find cheaper pussy anywhere , fuck it !
SETH: Step aside , asshole . Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth 's CHEST .
CHET: Not so fast , Slick .
SETH: Now , is my shit together , or is my shit together ? Richard and Seth laugh with each other .
RICHARD: Your shit is forever together !
SETH: Now this is my kinda place ! I could ecome a regular .
RAZOR CHARLIE: You ca n't come in here .
SETH: What dya mean ?
RAZOR CHARLIE: This is a private club . You 're not welcome .
SETH: Are you tellin ' me I 'm not good enough to drink here ?
RAZOR CHARLIE: This bar is for bikers and truckers only . You , get out !
BIG EMILIO: Walk , Pendaho .
SETH: Take your hand off me .
BIG EMILIO: I 'm going to count to three .
SETH: No , I 'm going to count to three .
BIG EMILIO: Uno
SETH: Two.. Jacob jumps in the middle .
JACOB: Now wait a minute , there 's no reason to get ugly . There 's just a misunderstanding going on here . You said this bar is for truckers and ikers , Well , I 'm a truck driver . Everybody looks at Jacob . As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet .
RAZOR CHARLIE: Welcome to the Titty Twister . What can I get you ? Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio 's paw .
SETH: Bottle of whiskey and five glasses .
RAZOR CHARLIE: Coming right up .
RICHARD: Good job , Pops . Seth 's still frying an egg on his head .
SETH: That 's just fuckin ' typical . Biggest number one problem with Mexico , it 's not service oriented . I was feelin ' so good , and those fuckin ' spies ought me down . Richard puts his arm around Seth .
RICHARD: Fuck 'em , shake it off .
SETH: You serve food , Jose ?
RAZOR CHARLIE: Best in Mexico .
SETH: I kinda doubt that . We 're grabbin ' a table , send over a waitress to take our order . Seth walks away , and the group follows him .
RICHARD: Anytime you want a lap dance with that oad , say the word . It 's on me , kiddo .
RAZOR CHARLIE: They 're not the normal road trash we normally feed on . But it 'll be okay . No one knows they 're here . The five of them find a table and sit down .
SETH: Who else ?
JACOB: Pass .
SETH: Why not , against your religion ?
JACOB: No , I do drink , I 'm just not drinking now .
SETH: Suit yourself , more for me . Scotty ? Scott shakes his head no .
SCOTT: Okay , I 'll have one .
JACOB: No you wo n't . Seth pours Scott a shot .
SETH: Sorry , Pops , but I 'm drinkin ' and I do n't like drinkin ' alone . Bottoms up , boy .
KATE: Okay .
RICHARD: Hey , Dr. Frankenstein , I think you just created a monster . Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly .
JACOB: Why are you so agitated ?
SETH: I 'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me . And that fuckin ' artender sticks a weed up my ass , too .
JACOB: He backed down .
SETH: He 's smilin ' at us . But behind his smile , he 's sayin ' , `` Fuck you Jack . '' I hear that loud and clear .
JACOB: What are you going to do ?
SETH: I 'm gon na just sit here and drain this bottle . And when I 've drunk the last drop , if I still feel then , the way I feel now , I 'm gon na take this ottle and break it over his melon head .
JACOB: Before we stepped in here , you told all of us to be cool . That means you , too .
SETH: I never said do what I do , I said do what I say .
JACOB: Are you so much a fucking loser , you ca n't tell when you 've won ?
SETH: What did you call me ?
JACOB: Nothing . I did n't make a statement . I asked a question . Would you like me to ask it again ? Very well . Are you such a loser you ca n't tell when you 've won ? The entire state of Texas , along with the FBI , is looking for you . Did they find you ? No . They could n't . They had every entrance to the border covered . There 's no way you could get across . Did you ? Yes , you did . You 've won , Seth , enjoy it .
SETH: Jacob , I want you to have a drink with me . I insist .
JACOB: To yours .
SETH: Forever together . Seth turns to Scott .
SCOTT: Yeah , it 's mine .
RAZOR CHARLIE: And now for your viewing pleasure . The Mistress of the Macabre . The Epitome of Evil . The most sinister woman to dance on the face of the earth . Lowly dogs , get on your knees , bow you heads and worship at the feet of
SANTANICO: Drink up .
SETH: Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo ! Now that 's what I call a fuckin ' show !
RICHARD: Yeah .
SETH: Well , then ask her , dumb ass .
RICHARD: Por favor , Senorita . Would you care to join us ?
SANTANICO: Muy bien , gracias .
SETH: Richie , you lucky bastard ! Now , little lady , you could of just as easily done that to me . Who a Nelly ! You got my dick harder ' n Chinese arithmetic . The table laughs .
JACOB: Oh , shit . Seth Seth waves him away .
SETH: Not now . So finally she comes across the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad Wolf 's laughing and says `` Little Red Riding Hood , you know better than to e walking around these woods alone . You know I 'm just gon na have to pull down your dress and squeeze you titties . '' Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her .357 , cocks it , sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf 's face and says `` No you wo n't . You 're gon na eat me , just like the story says . ''
RAZOR CHARLIE: Which one ?
CHET: This piece of shit broke my finge and my nose then this fag kicked me in the ribs while I was down . That 's all Big Emilio has to hear .
BIG EMILIO: Up !
RICHARD: Fuck off , ape man !
SETH: Scarred for life , that 's how I am !
KATE: Richie , look out ! Before Richie can turn around .
RICHARD: Shoot her ! Shoot her ! Get her off !
SETH: Richie .
WHORE: Dinner is served !
SANTANICO: Let 's see if you taste as good as you other .
BIG EMILIO: Noooooo ! He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans .
SETH: We may be in trouble .
SEX MACHINE: Anything you got ta say to them , say to me first .
CHET: You know what everybody says about me ? I suck !
FROST: Ai n't they supposed to burn up o something ?
SETH: Richie , I 'm sorry I fucked things up . You 'd really like it in El Ray . We 'd find peace there . I love you little other , I 'll miss ya bad .
RICHARD: I 'm glad you feel that way , Seth . I love you , too .
SETH: Touch my brother with that stake , iker , and vampires wo n't need to suck your blood , they 'll be able to lick it up off the floor .
SEX MACHINE: He ai n't your brother no more .
SETH: That 's a matter of opinion , and I do n't give a fuck about your 's .
JACOB: Do n't be an idiot , he 'll kill us all ! Seth aims his gun at the group .
SETH: Shut up ! Richard 's giggling .
RICHARD: Yeah , shut up .
SETH: Hold him down . The smile evaporates from Richard 's face .
KATE: Are you okay ?
SETH: Peachy ! Why should n't I be ? The world 's my oyster , except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother 's heart because he turned into a vampire , even though I do n't believe in vampires . Aside from that unfortunate business , everything 's hunky-dory .
KATE: I 'm really sorry .
SETH: Bullshit ! You hate us . If you had half a chance you 'd feed us to them !
JACOB: Then why did n't I ? Jacob walks over to Seth .
FROST: At first I just thought it was birds .
SEX MACHINE: No , it 's more of a gnawing sound . Birds peck , they do n't gnaw . Rats gnaw . Seth puts the bottle in his hand down .
SETH: It 's bats .
JACOB: Give me a hand !
SEX MACHINE: Watch out , girly !
FROST: We 'll put this out . You stake the rest of these fuckers .
SEX MACHINE: Way ahead of ya . What 's your name , girly ?
KATE: Kate , what 's yours ?
SEX MACHINE: Sex Machine . Pleased to meet'cha . Kate , let 's stake these blood-sucke fuckers .
SCOTT: We got a problem !
SETH: Get this bastard off of me !
JACOB: Is everybody okay ? Everyone mutters `` yeah . ''
SETH: Yeah , I know what 's going on . We got a bunch of fuckin ' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck ou fuckin ' blood ! That 's it , plain and simple . And I do n't wan na hear any ullshit about `` I do n't believe in vampires '' because I do n't fuckin ' elieve in vampires either . But I do elieve in my own two fuckin ' eyes , and with my two eyes I saw fuckin ' vampires ! Now , does everybody agree we 're dealin ' with vampires . Everybody agrees .
JACOB: I 'm like you . I do n't believe in vampires , but I believe in what I saw .
SETH: Good for you . Now , since we all elieve we 're dealing with vampires , what do we know about vampires ? Crosses hurt vampires . Do you have a cross ?
JACOB: In the Winnebago .
SETH: In other words , no .
SCOTT: What are you talking about ? We got crosses all over the place . All you got ta do is put two sticks togethe and you got a cross .
SEX MACHINE: He 's right . Peter Cushing does that all the time .
SETH: I do n't know about that . In order fo it to have any power , I think it 's got ta be an official crucifix .
JACOB: What 's an official cross ? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan ? What makes that official ? If a cross works against vampires , it 's not the cross itself , it 's what the cross represents . The cross is a symbol of holiness .
SETH: Okay , I 'll buy that . So we got crosses covered , moving right along , what else ?
FROST: Wooden stakes in the heart been workin ' pretty good so far .
SEX MACHINE: Garlic , holy water , sunlight I forget , does silver do anything to a vampire ?
SCOTT: That 's werewolves .
SEX MACHINE: I know silver bullets are werewolves . But I 'm pretty sure silver has some sort of effect on vampires .
KATE: Does anybody have any silver ?
ALL: No .
KATE: Then who cares ?
SCOTT: When 's sunrise ? Jacob looks at his watch .
JACOB: About two hours from now .
KATE: So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk ight out the front door .
SEX MACHINE: Yeah , that 's true , but I doubt ou arricades , that door , those plastered windows and these walls will last two more hours with those bat fucks fuckin ' with 'em .
JACOB: Has anybody here read a real book about vampires , or are we just emembering what a movie said ? I mean a real book .
SEX MACHINE: You mean like a Time-Life book ? Everybody laughs .
FROST: John Wesley Hardin , so mean he once shot a man for snorin ' .
JACOB: I take it the answer 's no . Okay then , what do we know about these vampires ?
SETH: Aside from they 're thirsty .
FROST: Well , one thing , they might got supe human strength , but you can hurt 'em .
JACOB: Yeah , that bottle upside the head of Santanico did n't kill her , but it did n't feel too good either .
SEX MACHINE: Another thing , you try and ram a oken chair leg in a human , you etter be one strong son-of-a-bitch . The human body is one rough-tough machine . But these vamps got soft odies . The texture of their skin is softer , mushier . You can push shit ight through 'em . Conceivably , if you hit one hard enough , you could take their fuckin ' head off .
SCOTT: You could take their head off .
SETH: Actually , our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man . He 's a preacher . Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob .
JACOB: I 've had enough of your taunts . Seth looks up from the floor .
SETH: I 'm not taunting you . We need you . A faithless preacher does n't mean shit to us . But a man who 's a servant of God can grab a cross , shove it in these monsters ' asses . A servant of God can bless the tap water and turn it into a weapon . Seth rises .
JACOB: I 'm a mean , mother fucking servant of God .
KATE: I do n't know if I can take two hours of that noise .
FROST: You can . You 'll take it 'cause ya got no choice . How 'd ya like twenty fou hours of it , lying in a muddy ditch with only the rotting corpses of you friends to keep you company ?
JACOB: What are you talking about ?
FROST: Back in '72 I was in Nam , trapped ehind enemy lines , lying in a rat hole with my entire squad dead . They thought they killed everybody , and except for me , they were right . But it was n't for lack of trying . A grenade lew up right next to me , that 's why I 'm so pretty .
SEX MACHINE: THIRST !
FROST: I been bit ! He fuckin ' bit me !
SEX MACHINE: What are you gon na do about it ?
SETH: Oh shit ! Jacob sees .
JACOB: Good lord !
SETH: You wan na suck something , suck on this !
KATE: We have to go back for Daddy !
SETH: Daddy 's dead .
KATE: Noooo !
SCOTT: He 's right , Kate . Daddy 's dead ! He was too far away . If flinging that doo and filling this room with those at-things would save him , I 'd fling it . The only thing it 'll do is turn us into one of them .
SETH: He needs our help !
SCOTT: He 's beyond our help . You saw him get it . I saw him get bit . We all saw it . You ca n't help him . I 've got no one left to lose but you . I ca n't be alone again . We 're sticking together .
JACOB: Open the door .
SETH: Did he ?
JACOB: Yep .
SETH: Fuck , piss , shit ! Mother fuckin ' vampires ! Mother fuckin ' vampires ! Goddamn mother fuckin ' vampires !
JACOB: You bet your sweet ass you are , and I 'm gon na help you do it . But we ai n't got much time .
KATE: You 're gon na be okay , are n't you , daddy ?
JACOB: No , I 'm not . I 've been bit . In effect , I 'm already dead .
SETH: My guess is that this little dive 's een feeding on nomad road waifs like ikers and truckers for a longtime . This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks .
JACOB: Well , I say lets tear this place apart for weapons . So when they burst through that door , we 'll make 'em wish they never did .
SETH: I do n't give a shit about living o dying anymore . I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can .
JACOB: Amen .
JACOB: Before we go any further , I need you three to promise me something . I 'll fight with you to the bitter end , ut when I turn into one of them , I wo n't be Jacob anymore . I 'll be a lap dog of Satan . I want you three to promise you 'll take me down , no different from the rest . The kids ca n't say the words .
SETH: I promise .
JACOB: Kate , Scott ?
KATE: I promise .
JACOB: Scott ?
SCOTT: Yeah , I promise . Jacob does n't believe them .
JACOB: Why do n't I believe you ? I 'm gon na ask you two again , then I want you to swear to God that you 'll kill me . If you do n't , I 'm gon na just kill myself right now . Now , since you need me I think you bette swear . Kate , do you swear to God that when I turn into one of the undead , you 'll kill me ?
KATE: Okay , okay , I promise I 'll do it !
JACOB: Not good enough , swear to God .
KATE: I swear to God , our father , that when you change into one of the undead , I will kill you .
JACOB: Good girl . Now , Scott , we have even less time , so I 'm only giving you the count of three . One
SCOTT: You do n't believe in suicide .
JACOB: It 's not suicide if you 're already dead . Two
SCOTT: Okay , I 'll kill you when you change , I swear to God in Jesus Christ 's name .
JACOB: Thank you , son .
SETH: Okay , vampire killers , let 's kill some fuckin ' vampires .
SCOTT: Why did they block the door again ?
JACOB: To keep the daylight out ! This is where they sleep ! Get to the door !
KATE: Seth !
SETH: Okay , dead boys , come on ! Take a bite and feel all right ! Kate clusters with her father and Scott .
KATE: I 'm going for 'em !
JACOB: No !
KATE: Everybody goes home !
SETH: Anytime .
SCOTT: I swear to God , in Jesus Christ 's name .
SETH: Fight now , cry later .
KATE: Oh my god .
SCOTT: Kill me , Kate !
SETH: How many bullets left , kid ?
KATE: Not many .
SETH: Well , when you run out of weapons , just start cold cocking 'em . Make 'em sing for their supper .
KATE: Should I use the last bullets on us ?
SETH: You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you .
CARLOS: What the fuck was going on in there ?
SETH: Why the fuck , outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico , did you have us rendezvous at that place ?
CARLOS: I do n't know , one place 's as good as another .
SETH: Have you ever been there before ?
CARLOS: No , but I passed by it a couple of times . It 's out in the middle of nowhere . It seems like a rowdy place , so there would n't be a lot of police . And it 's open from dusk till dawn . You said meet you in the morning .
SETH: Well , because you picked that place out of a hat , my brother 's dead now . And this girl 's family 's dead . Carlos stands up again .
CARLOS: I 'm sorry to hear that . What were they , psychos ?
SETH: Did they look like psychos ? They were fuckin ' vampires . Psychos do n't explode when sunlight hits 'em , I do n't care how crazy they are .
CARLOS: Oh , Seth , how can I ever make it up to you ?
SETH: You ca n't , but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start .
CARLOS: Twenty-eight .
SETH: Jesus Christ , Carlos , my brother 's dead and he 's not coming back , and it 's all your fault . Twenty .
CARLOS: You like the car ?
SETH: I said new , this is an '90 .
CARLOS: It 's hardly been used at all . I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years . Swear to God . That 's like new .
SETH: So do I just follow you ?
CARLOS: Yeah , follow us .
SETH: So let 's do it .
CARLOS: Vamanos !
SETH: I 'm sorry .
KATE: Me too . Long pause .
SETH: See ya .
KATE: Later .
SETH: Kate honey , I may be a bastard . But I 'm not a fuckin ' bastard . He blows her a kiss across the desert . She blows one back . Seth 's in his car and GONE .

HOLMES: Plenty of room for advancement fo a man who knows how to soldier . But he 's got to show me he 's got it on the ball . I do n't know what you 've een used to in the Bugle Corps , ut in my outfit we run it by the ook . What kind of trouble were you in over there ?
PREW: No trouble , sir .
HOLMES: What made you transfer out , then ?
PREW: It 's a personal matter , air .
HOLMES: Oh . I see
EXPLODES SUDDENLY: Who ? Me ? Whv , yes , air . You had Corpral 's stripes in the Bugle Corps , Prewitt . You took a bust to uck Private to transfer to an Infantry Compny . Why ? Because you like to hike ?
PREW: I dint have no trouble if that 's what you mean .
WARDED: Or was it just because you could n't stand to bugle ?
PREW: It was a personal matter .
WARDEN: That 's up to the Compny Commander 's discretion to decide .
PREW: All right . I was First Bugler at Shafter for two years . The topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states . Next day he made him First Bugler over me .
WARDEN: And you asked out on account of that ! ?
PREY: Maybe I just ai n't sensible But that 's the reason .
WARDEN: His feelings were hurt ! Kids they send us now !
HOLMES: I 've got a mighty sour Company Bugler here but I suppose you would n't want that job .
PREY: No , air .
HOLMES: Well , we 'll get your stripes back for you , maybe an extra one fo good measure . You know why you were sent over here when you requested transfer ?
PREW: No , sir .
HOLDS: I pulled a few strings . I 'm the Regimental Boxing Coach , Prewitt . I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl year before last . With any luck you should have won it . I thought for a while , in the second ound , you were going to knock him out .
PREW: Thank you , sir .
HOLMES: My Regiment got beaten last year in the finals , as you know .
SAVAGE INSISTENCE: But I mean to win this year . And I will . All I 've needed was a top middleweight . Next year I 'll hang your picture up there with the others , my boy .

HOLMES: You might as well say stop wa ecause one man got killed . Ou fighting program is the best morale uilder we have off here away from home .
PREW: I do n't want it disbanded , sir .
DOGGEDLY: But I do n't see why any man should fight unless he wants to .
HOLMES: It looks to me like you 're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf , Prewitt . You should know that in the Army it 's not the individual that counts . If a man wants to get ahead he has certain esponsibilities to fulfill that go eyond the regulations . It might look as though I were a free agent , ut I 'm not . Nobody is .

KAREN: If you 'd spend less time buttering Generals and more time with you Company , maybe you 'd get that promotion .
HOLDS: The Company takes care of itself . Or my Topkick takes care of it .
KAREN: I went over there this morning looking for you .
HOLMES: I had some business to attend to in town . During the afternoon .
KAREN: From the way you look I gather you usiness was n't too successful .
HOLMES: Now what does that mean ?
KAREN: Dana . Give me credit for a few ains .
HOLMES: How many , times do I have to tell you I have n't any other women efore you 'll believe me ?
HOLMES VOICE: If it were so , do n't you think I 'd admit it ? The way things are etween us now ? What right have you to always be accusing me ?
KAREN: What right ?
TWO SHOT: 17 .
HOLMES: That again . How long will it be , I wonder , before I 'm allowed to live that down ? After eight years , how many times do I have to tell you It Was An Accident ?
KAREN: That makes it all right , I suppose !
HOLMES: I did n't say that . I know what it 's done to you , but
KAREN: You know I hate to talk about it ! He moves over to her .
HOLM ES: How many times do I have to tell you I 'm sorry , about that ? How many times that I had no way of knowing -
KAREN: You had a way of knowing , Dana . I want to go to bed . Please get out of my bedroom .
CHOATE: I 'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight . Prew shoots , makes a brilliant shot .
MAGGIO: Man , what I would not give to have this character in the corne poolroom in my home town I 'd dress him up on overhalls and a straw hat and put a grass in his teeth , and I would make a whole mint of ghelt off him !

THORNHILL: You ai n't forget the Division champs get ten day furloughs , did you , son ? Ey ?
GALOVITCH: You no talk now , Prewitt . But out in field with us you sing different song . An do n't think you are tough guy . Quickest way to stockade is
BEING TOUGH: guy .
HENDERSON: You heard him . Better think it over .
MAGGIO: Lissen , it 's his right not to fight if he do n't want . Without bein kicked around . Now , we playin pool . Why n't you take off ?
DHOM: You want a busted head , Maggio ?
MAGGIO: No .

WARDEN: Hello , kid . Everythin nice and comfy ?
PREW: Never better .
WARDEN: 'at 's the lull before the storm , kid . Set yourself .
PREW: What 's the deal with him , anyway ? I ca n't figure him .
CHOATE: The Warden ? He 's a wild man . He was in the 15th when they seen thei action in the Settlement in Shanghai . I heard about it down in the Philippes even . He got himself a DSC and a Purple Heart out of it ut you 'd never know it if I dint tell you . This next war comes , Warden 'll be right in there , standin up on the skyline , trio to get himself killed , but nothing will ever touch him . He 'll come through maddern , wildern , craziern ever . All I know is he 's the best soljer I ever saw
DHOM'S VOICE: Prewitt ! Get in step , Prewitt !
GALOVITCH'S VOICE: Prewitt ! Dis a drill , not picnic ! Get in step !
DHOM: Prewitt ! Step out !
HENDERSON: rifle 's your beat friend . In case them weapons jams in combat could mean life or death . You got to know 'em inside out . Now I want you to strip them weapons and put it together again . Go !
HENDERSON'S VOICE: 'at 's fair time . Now lemma see you put it together .
HENDERSON: Your rear sight 's way off ! You 'd be fifty feet off your target at three hundred yards ! That 's what comes when a solje do n't know how to assemble a ifle .
TO PREW: You better get down to the track and carry it around a few times . Maybe that 'll teach you
THORNHILL: Wide open , ey , Prewitt ? Maybe seven laps 'll teach you to watch yourself Maggio , wielding his rifle madly , yells over .
MAGGIO: Hey , I saw that I saw what you
MAGGIO: I use to think a shipping clerk was a dog 's life . What I would not give to be back in Gimbel 's basement !
WARDEN: Chow 's almost over , men . Bette hurry up and wash. ` less of course you 'd rather go in the way you are .
LEVA: I 'm tellin you , Top , she 's trouble . You better keep your mind off what you 're thinkin .
HOLMES: I wo n't be back in time to take Retreat . Or Reveille either , probably .
WARDEN: Yes , sir .
HOLMES: ( strides back and forth ;
JOVIALLY: All work and no play , Sergeant . All you do is sit around sweating ove this paper and that . There are other things in this world beside work .
HOLMES: ( bending over , tying
SHOELACE: 26 . HOLMES You ought to get out more yourself , Warden .
WARDEN: I 've been considering it . He turns aside as Holmes straightens up .
HOLMES: Well , I 'm going . He claps Warden on the back fraternally .
WARDEN: It 'll be here when you get back .
KAREN: Oh . If it is n't Sergeant Warden . You better step inside or you 'll get wet .
WARDEN: I am wet .
KAREN: If you 're looking for my husband , he is n't here .
WARDEN: And if I 'm not looking for him ?
KAREN: He still is n't here . If that does you any good .
WARDEN: Well , I 'm looking for him . Do you know where he is ?
KAREN: I have n't the slightest idea . Perhaps he 's in town . I guess it was ` in town ' the way you put it , was n't it ? Or perhaps he 's at the Club . Having a drink .
WARDEN: I got some papers it 's important for him to sign . Today .
KAREN: I 'll try phoning him at the Clu for you .
WARDEN: I never like to disturb a man drinking .
KAREN: What is it you want , Sergeant ?
WARDEN: I could use a drink myself right now . Bad . Anyway , I got a faint suspicion the Captain 's ` in town . ' Ai n't you going to ask me in ?
KAREN: You 're taking an awful chance , you know . My maid is liable to be home any time .
WARDEN: No she wo n't . Thursday 's her day off .
KAREN: You think of everything , do n't you , Sergeant ?
WARDEN: I try . In my position you have to .
KAREN: ( goes to sink , picks up
THE PAPERS: Are these really important ?
WARDEN: Yes . But not important they get signed today . Tomorrow 's okay .
KAREN: That 's what I like about you , Sergeant . You have confidence . It 's also what I dislike about you .
WARDEN: It 's not confidence . It 's honesty .
KAREN: Honesty ? How did you acquire such an old-fashioned virtue ?
WARDEN: I figgered out one day it was the shortest distance between two points .
KAREN: Well , he 's clever as well as virile .
WARDEN: No it 's just that I hate to see a beautiful woman goin all to waste .
KAREN: Waste , did you say ? Now that 's a subject I might tell you something about . There 's we . And then there 's waste . Positive and negative . The negative is sometimes more interesting more evil . Fo example what about the house without a child ? Tell me you thoughts , Sergeant .
WARDEN: You 're going to cry .
KAREN: Not if I can help it .
WARDEN: Please do n't cry I ca n't stand to see somebody cry .
KAREN: What are you doing ?
WARDEN: I 'm leaving . Is n't that what you want ?
KAREN: I do n't know , Sergeant . To be honest , I do n't know .
WARDEN: I know a beach near Diamond Head . Nobody ever goes there . The cars on the highway pass above and they never know it 's there . You feel like you used to feel when you were a kid , hiding by yourself in a cave , watching the others hunting you .
KAREN: Maybe why not ?
WARDEN: How about Payday ?
KAREN: You do n't have to spend money on me , Sergeant .
WARDEN: I just like to have some on me when I take out a woman . Can you get away ?
KAREN: Maybe .
WARDEN: I 'll be in Kuhio Park . Say , nine o'clock . Payday .
HOLMES: this man Prewitt 's been here over a month now . I expected you mend have him around before this .
HENDERSON: We 've been runnin him pretty hard . But he do n't faze .
HOLMES: Maybe he needs a good dose of The Treatment .
GALOVITCH: A double dose needs him to be given .
THORNHILL: The Treatment 'll bring that puppy oy around
HOLMES: You understand . I do n't want any rough stuff .
MORE: 32 . HOLMES But we all know good athletes make good leaders . And good leaders
MONTAGE: 33 .
TREADWELL: Ah+m suppose to be a automatic ifle man , not a spud-cutter .
STARK: Rifle man , huh ? All somebody 'd have to do would be holler war at you and it 'd be over the hill and fa away . Stark walks off .
TREADWELL: they just give me my chance they 'll see
PREW: No cook ever used that many panel Not even for an officers , banquet , ladies invited ! Want me to grow couple more arms ? !
WILLARD: All I ask is that you keep the pans washed up so they 're clean when I need them . In order that I am allowed to cook the kind of food equired for men who work hard all day and who need good nourishing food to get their nourishment .
STARK: Hole up 'at noise . This man 's hot as a forty-five shootin downhill .
TERRIBLY INJURED: How you think I can do my job if the Mess Sergeant takes sides with a goldbricking KP ? What do you think I am ?
STARK: I think you 're a fat cook who ca n't cook .
MAGGIO: Comin through ! Comin through ! Me and my table waiters !

WARDEN: You look awful tard , kid .
WARDEN'S VOICE: How do you like straight duty ? . Life in a rifle compny , eh ? Prew stops working , turns toward Warden .
PREW: What makes you think I mind it ?
WARDEN: I did n't say you minded it , kid . I just said you looked tard . Drawn to a fine edge .
PREW: I do n't mind it , Top . It 's a great life , this . I find a pearl , I 'll cut you in . Fifty-fifty , If you had n't put me here , I would n't have had no chance to find it .
WARDEN: Well , well , there 's a man for you . I 'll see if I can fix you up with a lot more since you like it so much . How you like the garbage detail ?
PREW: Thanks , Top , I 've had it . You give it to me Tuesday . Remember ?
WARDEN: ( nods , as if just
REMEMBERING: Well , then , how 'bout street cleaning detail ?
PREW: That , too . Yesterday .
WARDEN: You got a better memory than me . Guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while , huh ?
PREW: If you think you can push me into fightin , Warden , you 're wrong . Not you and Dynamite and The Treatment . I 'm twice the man you are . If you dint have them stripes I 'd take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp .
WARDEN: Do n't let the stripes worry you , kid . I can always take my shirt off . Take it off right now .
PREW: You 'd like that . You could get me a year in the Stockade for that one , could n't you ?
WARDEN: Do n't throw it , Prewitt . It might eak on my head . And that would cost you one thin dime next Payday .
HOLMES: and just see you do n't drink all this up in one place .
WARDEN: Prewitt . Prew , next in line , steps up to the table .

MAGGIO: There . You see . Any time women see a soldier , think he 's drunk . Why ? You know why ?
PREW: Because he is .
MRS. KIPPER: Heavy drinking simply does n't mix with the entertainment business . Every respectable place must consider its future .
PREW: Mrs. Kipfer , ma'am , I give you my solemn word your future will be safe with us .
MRS. KIPPER: Angelo is one of my favorites . Annette , dear , take care of this gentleman , will you , please ?
ANNETTE: It 'll be eight bucks , Babyface . Four for initiation fee , four fo April dues .

LORENE: Oh . Somehow I did n't think you were a soldier .
PREW: Well , I am . And I 'm in for the whole ride . I 'm a thirty-year man .
LORENE: I suppose it 's different when a fellow is going to make a career of it .
PREW: There ai n't anythin wrong with a soljer that ai n't wrong with everyone else .
LORENE: I like you just the same . I liked you the minute I saw Annette inging you in .
PREW: Me , too . I mean when I came in . I saw you over here

PREW: Friend of mine .

LORENE: Sit down and just listen . He describes it thrillingly .
BILL: You know anything about surfboarding ?
PREW: No . Nothing . Not a thing .
BILL: You must be stationed inland then . I 'm at DeRussey so I get lots of chances .
PREW: Yeah ? But then we got mountains . You know anything about mountain climbing ?
BILL: A little bit . Are you a mountain climber ?
PREW: No . You know anything about flying an airplane ? Lorene is frowning now .
BILL: I 've had a few lessons .
PREW: Well , I ca n't fly either . What do you know about deep sea diving ?

WARDEN: Maybe I 'd of been early too only I stopped to get a drink .
KAREN: You certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting .
WARDEN: Would you rather it 'd been the cocktail lounge of the Royal ?
KAREN: No , but I 've had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes .
WARDEN: ( sits beside her on the
BENCH: That 's par for the course around here .
KAREN: Well , I do n't care for it . I neve went in much for back-alley loving .
WARDEN: Did n't you ?
KAREN: You probably think I 'm a tramp , do n't you ?
WARDEN: What makes you think I 'd think that ?
KAREN: Do n't try to be gallant , Sergeant . If you think this is a mistake , come right out and say so .
WARDEN: Listen , what started all this , anyway ? Why 'm I shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher ! Where 'd I come up with a yen for of all things the Compny Commander 's wife ! And her actin like Lady Astor 's horse all because I only got here on time !
KAREN: On the other hand , I 've got a athing suit under my dress .
WARDEN: Funny . I got one in a U-Drive-It parked around the corner .
PREW: How 's the surfboard rider ?
LORENE: That was a terrible way to have acted . What you did .
PREW: I was jealous .

PREW: What do you dames want ? To take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire ?
LORENE: ( angry because she really

LORENE: You certainly are a funny one .
KAREN: I hope the ocean 's ice cold . I hope I freeze in a solid chunk .
WARDEN: Just so long 's you melt afterwards .
KAREN: I love the way you laugh .
LORENE: I enlisted , too . I came out here on my own . To get away from my home town . In Oregon .
PREW: How come ?
LORENE: I had a boy friend . I was a waitress . He was from the richest family in town . He just married the girl suitable for his position . After three years of going around with me .
PAUSE: It 's a pretty story , is n't it ? Maybe they could make a movie of it .
PREW: They did . Ten thousand of them .
ANOTHER ANGLE: Lorene smiles .
LORENE: So I left and went to Seattle , as a waitress . And I met a girl just ack from Hawaii . She said she 'd made a lot of money working fo Mrs. Kipfer . I caught the first oat . I 've been here a year and two months .
PREW: You like it much ?
LORENE: Oh , I do n't like it . But I do n't mind it . Anyway , I wo n't be here forever .
PREW: No . Sure not . I mean , why should you ?
LORENE: I have it all figured out . In another year I 'll be back home , with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer . And then I will be all set for life
MAGGIO: I dint hear no sounds of combat . So I figgered maybe you 'd like a drink .
THREE SHOT: as Maggio comes into the room .
MAGGIO: Or otherwise old Sandra would of drank it all by herself . She 's a fine girl . But she drinks like a fish .
LORENE: No , thanks . I never drink much .
MAGGIO: I grant you that .
LORENE: And I do n't like weakness .
TO PREW: Do you ?
PREW: No . I do n't like weakness . But I like to drink . He comes back to the divan .
LORENE: With you it 's not a weakness . With you it 's more like a virtue .
MAGGIO: That sounds like a very profound emark . Maybe that 's why I do n't get it .
LORENE: Well , it 's so .
MAGGIO: Hey ! What you gon na do , marry this guy ? Way you grinnin at him you look like his wife !
PREW: Get outa here !
MAGGIO: Okay . Back to old long-legged Sandra . I love 'em tall . Acres and acres .
PREW: That was nice before . The way you snuggled up . In front of him .
LORENE: What 's he mean , The Treatment ?
PREW: Some of the guys puttin me over the jumps because I wo n't fight .
LORENE: Fight ?
PREW: On the boxing team . I do n't want to fight ! I do n't want to talk about it ! I do n't want to think about it . And they make me think about it . Every day . He drops down on the divan beside her .
MORE: 55 . PREW From the way he fell I knew . Dead weight , square on his face . He dint oll over . He was in a coma a week . Then he finally came out of it . The only thing was that he was blind I went up to the hospital to see him . Twice . Then I could n't go ack . We got to talking about fighting the second time . And Dixie cried Seein tears comin out of those eyes that could n't see
KAREN: Nobody ever kissed me that way not really
WARDEN: Nobody ?
KAREN: No . Nobody .
WARDEN: Not even one ? Out of all the many men you 've been kissed by ?
KAREN: Well , that will take some figuring . How many men do you think there 've een ?
WARDEN: I would n't know . Ca n't you even make me a rough estimate ?
KAREN: Not without an adding machine . Do you have your adding machine with you ?
WARDEN: No , I forgot to bring it .
KAREN: Then I guess you wo n't find out , will you ?
WARDEN: Maybe I already know .
KAREN: What 's the matter ? What are you hinting at ?
WARDEN: Why ? Is there something to hint at ?
KAREN: I do n't know . Maybe a lot . Or maybe you just think there 's a lot .
WARDEN: Maybe I do . Maybe there 's been a long line of beach parties
KAREN: You must be crazy !
WARDEN: Am I ? Listen , baby , maybe not here . But what about when you and Holmes were at Fort Bliss ?
KAREN: I had to go and forget you were a man with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have . For a minute I had to convince myself you were different
WARDEN: Only it 's true , ai n't it ?
KAREN: Yes , it 's true ! A part of it , some small part of whatever sewage you 've been listening to . Some day perhaps you 'll get all the story .
WARDEN: All what story ?
KAREN: You 're getting to sound so much like a typical male . So you just sweat it out like a typical male .
WARDEN: Listen .
KAREN: He was only a little drunk when he came in at five a.m . He looked alarmed when he saw me . I guess it was because of my screams . I was lying there on the floor , you see No , do n't say anything . I 'm not finished yet . Of course , the baby was dead . It was a boy . But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine . They even took my appendix out , too . They threw that in free . It was all fine .
WARDEN: Listen . Listen . Please .
KAREN: And , of course , one more thing no more children . Do you know what that means ? You 're not a woman . You 're not anything . You 're a gutted shell Sure , I went out with some of the men after that . A few months of it . I 'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean . You can see that , ca n't you ? Anyway , I got my revenge on Dana . I kept on living with him .
WARDEN: The hateful , miserable
KAREN: You hunt so hungrily for love love , if you can find it , you think , might give things meaning again .
WARDEN: Listens Listen to me
KAREN: All right . I 'm listening .
TREADWELL: Ah 'm in the Army because Ah can live better on the Inside than on the Outside .
PREW: It ai n't the reason I 'm in .
MAGGIO: Now he 's gon na give us that snow about bein a Thirty-Year Man again .
PREW: That 's right . Look at Karelsen there . Only seven years more fo ockin chair money . Karelsen hears his name , looks over .

KAREN: Home A beach , a car , a park Warden puts his arm around her tenderly .
WARDEN: It 'll work out
KAREN: It ca n't go on like this much longer , Milt .
WARDEN: I know . He rises , paces a moment .
KAREN: ( bucking up courage ;
QUIETLY: There is a way . I 've been thinking about it . Warden looks at her apprehensively .
KAREN: You 've got to become an officer .
WARDEN: What !
KAREN: You 're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft . When you get your commission they 'd ship you back to the States new officers are n't kept at posts where they 've been enlisted men . Then
WARDEN: You sure made a thorough study of it .
KAREN: Then I could divorce Dana and follow you and marry you .
WARDEN: An officer ! I 've always hated officers .
KAREN: That 's a fine , intelligent point of view . Suppose I said I 've always hated Sergeants . That would make a lot of sense , would n't it ?
WARDEN: Okay , suppose I did it . And do n't think it 's a cinch the exams are tough . Then you 'd be getting your divorce here while I 'm in the States . We 'd be apart maybe six months ! We 'll probly be in the war by then
KAREN: You ca n't be certain of that
WARDEN: Put it down on your calendar . On October twenty-third , 1941 , Milt Warden told you we 'd be in the wa in less than a year .
KAREN: Why do n't you tell the truth ?
MORE: 96 . KAREN You just do n't want the esponsibility . You 're probably not even in love with me
WARDEN: You 're crazy ! I wish I was n't in love with you . Maybe could enjoy life again .
KAREN: I do n't know what 's happened to you you were honest at first
WARDEN: At first ! You were tough and solid as a rock and now you 're a whining crybaby He stops abruptly .
KAREN: And so they were married and lived unhappily ever after . They are silent for several moments .
WARDEN: I 've never been so miserable in my life as I have since I met you .
KAREN: Neither have I .
WARDEN: I would n't trade a minute of it .
KAREN: Neither would I .
WARDEN: I 'll probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this Army .
KAREN: You 'll make a fine officer . A emarkable officer .
PREW: I never caught on to dancing much .
ALMA: You 're a very good dancer .
PREW: I been wanting to tell you a long time now
DEEP BREATH: I love you .
ALMA: That 's nice . Because I love you , too .
TWO SHOT: as Alma comes over to Prew .
PREW: I mean it . I need you .
ALMA: I 'm glad . Because I need you , too .
PREW: A thirty-year man is movin all over , goin all the time . Up to now I never thought a thirty-year man had any business to think of gettin married . She stares at him , amazed , a touch angry .
ALMA: You 're a funny one , little Prew oy .
PREW: Yeah . Must be the altitude .
ALMA: A very funny one that I can not figure out .
PREW: Why 's it funny if a guy wants to marry you ?
ALMA: Because I 'm a girl you met at the New Congress Club ! And that 's about two steps up from the pavement .
PREW: Okay I 'm a private no class dogface soljer . And the way most civilians look at it , that 's two steps up from no thin .
ALMA: Oh , Prew , Prew , I thought we were happy Why do you want to spoil things ?
PREW: Lissen , I ai n't think in of now . But I got a plan cookin in my head . You want to go back to the States in a year . Well , you could stretch it some , make it two years . And I could swing a Sergeant 's stripes If I were a non-com the Army 'd let me pick my duty when I re-enlist . ( lost in the picture of
IT: And there 's some posts back in the States like Jefferson Barracks The married noncoms rate solid ick houses with lawns with new- cut grass and walks with big old oak trees
ALMA: Now I know you 've lost your mind ! How do you expect to become a Sergeant under this Captain Holmes of yours ? It 's all you can do to keep out of the Stockade !
PREW: I could fight .
PREW: It I go out for boxin he 'd send me to non-com school . The Regimental Championship is next month . I bet I could win the middleweight even without training . I used to be pretty good I could do it .
ALMA: No . I do n't think you should give in to The Treatment even to marry me .
PREW: This 'd be worth it .
ALMOST DESPERATELY: Prew it 's true we love each other now . But back in America , it might be different We might not even want each other
PREW: Okay . But that ai n't the real eason .
ALMA: All right . It 's not .
PREW: What 's the real reason you wo n't marry me ?
ALMA: I wo n't marry you because I do n't want to be the wife of a soldier .
PREW: Well , that 's the top I could eve do for you
ALMA: Because nobody 's going to stop me from my plan . Nobody . Nothing . Because want to be proper .
PREW: Proper ?
ALMA: Yes , proper . Respectable . Secure . In a year I 'll have enough money saved . I 'm going back to my home town in Oregon and I 'm going to uild a new home for my mother and myself and join the country clu and take up golf . And then I 'll meet the proper , man with the proper position . And I 'll be a proper wife who can keep a prope home and raise proper children . And I will be happy because when you are proper you are safe .
PREW: ( bitterly disappointed but
ADMIRING: 101 . PREW You got guts , Alma . I hope you pull it off .
ALMA: But I do mean it when I say I need you . Because I 'm lonely . Sometimes I 'm dreadfully lonely You think I 'm lying , do n't you ?
PREW: No . Nobody ever lies about being lonely
HOLMES: I 've known about it for a long time ! I 've sensed it . And I 'm not going to ignore it any longer ! I want to know where you met him and just who he is .
KAREN: I 'm afraid I 'm not going to tell you .
HOLMES: You ca n't keep a thing like this
KAREN: I 'm not going to hide anything . I 'm just not going to tell you .
HOLMES: One thing I know . I know it 's a civilian . You 'd be too discreet to pick an Army man .
KAREN: I do n't think it 's any of you usiness who he is .
HOLMES: It is my business ! I 'm you husband ! What do you think a scandal would do to my chances fo a promotion ? So if you 're thinking of a divorce , you can forget it !
KAREN: Not very nice . But then there 's the compensation of knowing you 'll have to live with me the rest of you life .
HOLMES: You do n't know how a man feels about a thing like this . It breaks a man all up inside .
KAREN: I gander why men feel so differently about it than women .
HOLMES: It 's it 's just not the same .
KAREN: Done all what ?
HOLMES: Tried to be a Company Commande when I hate it , worked my fool head off with this miserable boxing squad , tagged after the General whenever I could .
KAREN: I do n't know . Why ?
HOLMES: Why , for you and for me . For ou home , that 's why .
KAREN: I always thought you did it because you wanted to get ahead . She finishes the last of her food , stands .
HOLDS: I 'm willing to forgive you . Tell me who he is . Make a clean breast of it . And I 'll forgive you .
KAREN: I wonder which is hurt more you pride or your curiosity ? She disengages her wrist .
PREW: You just get out of the Stockade ?
NAIR: It was rugged , sam . But I kept my mouth shut and watched my step and I was n't in no trouble .
PREW: You see Maggio ?
NAIR: Fatso 's workin him over with a hoe handle . Places where it wo n't show mostly . You know , the back and the chest . The kidneys . Once in a while in the face . Know what Maggio does when that happens ? Spits in Fatso 's eye .
CHUCKLES: Oh , he 's a hot one . Ai n't he a hot one ?
PREW: He 's a good boy .
NAIR: Course , he throws up a little blood now and then . And he passes out a lot . But Fatso sure ai n't reportin none of that . So there 's no way they goin to find out .
PREW: Why do n't he go to the C.O . ?
NAIR: We tried to get him to . But he wo n't peep . He says he got a lot more scalp to lose first . That boy is about the hardest artery in the hospital . But he 's got a heart just like a great big baby .
PREW: You think he 's gon na be all right ?
NAIR: Your guess is worth mine , sam . Maybe he 's crackin a little at that cause after Fatso put him in the Hole that 's what they call solitary a couple times he began talkin about how he 's gon na e- scape . He said to tell you he 'll look you up one of these nights .
GALOVITCH: Still on knees , eh , Prewitt ? Well , oxing finals next month . Decembe f if teen . You s till got time help us make champions .

SPECTATOR: I do n't get it Why do n't Prew go for the head ?
DHOM: He blinded a guy once . Must be scairt of the same thing .
HOLMES' VOICE: I 'll be glad to recommend you , Warden . You 've got service , experience , grade . You 'll make an excellent officer .
AFTER HESITATING: Thank you , sir .
HOLMES: At ease , Sergeant . What 's the matter ?
THORNHILL: They fightin on the green , sir ! Galovitch and Prewitt .

COLONEL WILLIAMS: - In addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty , Captain Holmes has een guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid Private Prewitt . This extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment oxing team . These findings are the esult of personal investigation by the Inspector General and are corroborated by numerous members of G Company .
GENERAL SLATER: I 'm waiting for your reply to this .
HOLMES: I have n't any , sir The charges are true .
GENERAL SLATER: Holmes , the first thing I eve learned in the Army was that an officer takes care of his men . It seems to be the first thing you forgot . It 's monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops . And believe me , you wo n't e for long . My only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded .
MORE: 130 . GENERAL SLATER In the meantime , of course , I 'm elieving you of your present duties .
HOLMES: If there were any way to avoid a court martial , sir . Any way
COLONEL WILLIAMS: There is one alternative , General if you 're so disposed . A esignation for the good of the service under AR 600-275 .
GENERAL SLATER: I 'll give you a chance you do n't deserve , Holmes . Write a letter of esignation and have it on my desk this afternoon . I 'll conside accepting it . Only because as fa as I 'm concerned , the quicke you 're out of the Army the bette for everybody . Especially the Army .
HOLMES: - that 's right , it 's a letter of esignations I 'm through ! I 've already been relieved ! So you can egin packing . We 're sailing fo the States next week !
ROSS: I do n't intend to have a sloppy outfit . I do n't intend to have a goldbrick outfit . I do n't intend to have a soft soap outfit . I 've called you noncoms in because you 're the backbone of any Company .

ROSS: I know . Private Galovitch is in the kitchen .
WARDEN: In the kitchen ?
ROSS: As of now , he 's an assistant cook . I busted him . On a blanket charge of inefficiency . What are you grinning at ?
WARDEN: I think the Company Commander made a wise decision , sir .
GRIM NOW: No . No , we 'll have to talk about it soon . Right away . I - I do n't know
WARDEN: Lissen , I 'll get away somehow , tonight . I 'll meet you in Kuhio Park . At eight Right .

WARDEN: I wanted to I tried but I could n't

WARDEN: We 're not saying good-bye we 'll figger out a way for you to stay
KAREN: I 'm going back with him , Milt . There 's something in being needed . It is n't love . But it 's something .

GERDA: Arendelle is indebted to you , You Highness .
HANS: The castle is open . There 's soup and hot glögg in the Great Hall . He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard .
DUKE: Prince Hans , are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle 's tradable goods ?
HANS: Princess Anna has given her orders and
DUKE: And that 's another thing ; has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all ? Hans 's nice eyes turn to threatening slits .
HANS: Do not question the Princess . She left me in charge , and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason .
DUKE: Treason ? !

CROWD: Princess Anna 's horse . What happened to her ? Where is she ?
HANS: Princess Anna is in trouble . I need volunteers to go with me to find her !

RAY: Have you ever gotten caught ?
LILA: Once .
RAY: What happened ?
LILA: They gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail .
RAY: What did you do ?
LILA: I paid the fine . I made the money back in two nights of smuggling . But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it . Some of the troopers were into it , too .
RAY: Smuggling ?
LILA: Yeah . But when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to Chinese .
RAY: Right , I know .

SOPHINA: Do n't fucking my bad me Osc ! What was you doin when you was pretending to go to work ? You know what ? I do n't even want to know .

SOPHINA: So you would have just kept faking like you were going to work ? And would have just been out bustin nocks ? And doing whatever else , o WHOEVER else you do while I 'm at work ?
OSCAR: I thought you wanted the truth But you ai n't trying to hear that . Sophina does n't know what to say to this .

CEEPHUS: Steelers . Daryl shakes his head at this .
DARYL: A Raiders fan , cheering for the Steelers .
CEEPHUS: Black uniforms , black players , lack coach . Coach even has a black wife . I 'm going with the Steelers .
DARYL: You 're insane , you know that ? Oscar cracks up at this .
GRANDMA BONNIE: If somebody told me say twenty years ago , that I would live to see it happen , I 'd have laughed in their face .
OSCAR: If somebody would have told me that two years ago I would have laughed in their face .
DARYL: And here we are . 2008 and its happened .
CEEPHUS: But I think it 's a sign of the times . The country is in bad enough shape for them to hand it over to a lack guy . Look , if Bush had n't have messed the country up so bad . Would he have even had a shot ?
DARYL: I think he still would have had a shot .
CEEPHUS: But would he have won though ?
WANDA: Well , I 'm happy the did win . If the country really is as messed up as you say , I think he 's our best chance of fixing it .
SOPHINA: I keep thinking about how much it means for T .
OSCAR: When I was coming up , Teachers used to love to tell me , `` You can be the President of the United States . ''
WANDA: You 'd make a great politician . You can talk your way out of anything . Sophina and Oscar share a look .
OSCAR: But I 'll never forget , in my fourth grade classroom we had this poster . It had all 40 some odd presidents on that thang . And I looked at all they faces . And it was all white dudes . At that point , I realized my teachers was lying to me . A part of me aint believed what no teacher has said to me since .
DARYL: Now there will be a black face on those posters .
GRANDMA BONNIE: Well let 's let him get in there first .
WANDA: I know , I still feel like it 's just too good to be true .
CEEPHUS: What 's so good about it ?
DARYL: A black man , one of us has been elected president , fair and square . Ceephus shakes his head at this .
CEEPHUS: But he 's not one of us . He was n't affected by slavery .
OSCAR: Oh , Come'on Ma , do n't mention it . You should n't even be doing this .
WANDA: I enjoy washing dishes . It 's elaxing .

GERARD: My name is Gerard . U.S . Marshal 's Office . Sykes is caught off guard .
SYKES: Richard Kimble I do n't know a Richard Kim - Poole produces a photo of Kimble .
GERARD: Would he have a reason to ?
SYKES: What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? Because I have this ?
GERARD: What kind of business are you in , Mr. Sykes ?
SYKES: Security .
GERARD: Independent ?
SYKES: No , I work for a pharmaceutical company . I handle security for its top executives .
GERARD: Any idea why Kimble would be interested in these ?
SYKES: No . Just some doctors on a company junket .
GERARD: By all means .
RENFRO: He 's pulling our chain , Sam . If this was the guy Kimble was looking for , why call us ?
GERARD: Kimble said he 's putting together a puzzle . We do n't need to put it together too , we just need to be there when he gets to the next piece .
OPERATOR: I 'm sorry sir , Dr. Nichols is at a medical conference at the Hilton .
KIMBLE: It 's very important I reach him .
ASSISTANT: I 'm sorry , sir , they said it was an emergency . Nichols excuses himself from the table .
KIMBLE: Can you talk ?
NICHOLS: Richard . Yes I 'm on a hotel phone . What 's going on ?
KIMBLE: I found him , Charlie . I found the guy that killed Helen .
NICHOLS: What ?
KIMBLE: It 's all about a drug , Charlie . They tried to kill me because of a drug .
NICHOLS: Who ?
KIMBLE: Devlin-MacGregor and Lentz . Lentz was supervising the R.D.U.90 protocol . He knew I 'd found out the drug had problems . It 's Lentz .
NICHOLS: Richard , Lentz is dead . He died in an auto accident last summer . Kimble is stunned .
KIMBLE: I need your help . Call Mr. Roosevelt and tell him I 'm coming in .
RENFRO: If you were Richard Kimble Why would you hunt for a one-armed man you think killed your wife ; find hint then leave him and call us ?
POOLE: To throw us off his trail .
RENFRO: Unless What if you were a well espected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife ? How would you do it ?
BIGGS: I 'd hire a pro . Sight unseen .
POOLE: Set it up to look like a robbery gone bad .
RENFRO: How would you find him ? Look in the phone book ?
POOLE: Maybe through a company you did some usiness with .
BIGGS: Like a pharmaceutical company . Someone in security .
NEWMAN: On the night of his wife 's murder , Kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by Devlin-Macgrego Pharmaceutical - Sykes ' company .
BIGGS: But Sykes claims he was out of town .
POOLE: And company records support that he was on a business trip .
RENFRO: That 's an easy fix . So let 's say he was in town . Did the job . Everything goes as planned with one problem .
NEWMAN: Instead of looking like a robbery gone bad , Kimble ends up being the one accused
BIGGS: tried , convicted
POOLE: and the hit man gets away clean .
RENFRO: So Kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man .
NEWMAN: Why ? To share the blame ? He 'd still go to prison .
RENFRO: You 're underestimating the power of the good doctor . It would be his word against Sykes ' . Who would you believe ?
BIGGS: So what does Kimble do next ?
RENFRO: Get help .
GERARD: Stevens , check phone records fo Sykes and Kimble .
NEWMAN: Why do I get all the great jobs ?
ROOSEVELT: It sure is good to see you again , Dr. Kimble .
KIMBLE: You too , Roosevelt Been a long time . Roosevelt closes the door behind them .
ROOSEVELT: This is the R.D.U.90 file and samples . Dr. Nichols said you needed .
KIMBLE: Thanks , Roosevelt .
SYKES: I want to report a fire ; No , it 's not my place , it 's a couple doors down .
WAHLUND: Oh , my God Richard .
KIMBLE: I loaned you something once , Kath , and I need them back .
NICHOLS: Mr. Gerard .
GERARD: Doctor . Could I have a minute ? He opens the door to an empty meeting room .
RENFRO: He 's a security specialist at Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals . Kimble broke into his apartment .
NICHOLS: I do n't know him . You 're getting pretty desperate are n't you , Mr. Gerard . I told you , you would n't find Richard .
GERARD: Dr. Kimble has n't come back to you for help , has he ?
NICHOLS: No . And it seems like we 've been over this ground before . Now if you 'll excuse me .
GERARD: Dr. Nichols . Do you know the othe man in the photograph ? Nichols stops , looks at Lentz and lies .
NICHOLS: I never saw him before . He leaves . Gerard watches him .
RENFRO: `` Advances in Nuclear Tissue and Pathology Research , '' by Dr. Charles Nichols . I bet they line up to hear that one .
KIMBLE: Half the people in the study were indigents . No follow-up , no baseline on them . Who could say they did n't come into the study with bad livers ?
WAHLUND: The one on the right is one of the samples you sent me . It shows a lot of perriportal inflammation loaded with eosinophils . When you see that with the accumulation of bile it 's a classic for -
KIMBLE: - drug induced hepatitis .
WAHLUND: I 'm impressed . Now look at this . She positions a second slide .
KIMBLE: Cold normal .
WAHLUND: Clearly not from the same tissue . In fact . She yields the microscope to Kimble .
KIMBLE: That 's statistically impossible .
WAHLUND: That 's because they 're all from the same liver . She smiles at Kimble .
BETTY: His name 's Lentz . A pathologist . I only remember him because he died last summer . Biggs and Newman exchange a look .
NEWMAN: Anybody down in pathology who might know something about the guy ?
BETTY: It 's kinda late to catch anyone , ut you might go by the morgue . There 's an old guy down there who 's been around forever .
BIGGS: Just what I want to do before dinner .
NEWMAN: Are you Mr. Roosevelt ?
ROOSEVELT: Yes .
BIGGS: We 're United States Marshals . We 're trying to find out some information about a pathologist , named Lentz . He used to be on staff here . Roosevelt suddenly goes on the defensive .
ROOSEVELT: He 's dead .
NEWMAN: Yeah , we heard . We wanted to know if he knew or had any contact with Dr. Richard Kimble ?
ROOSEVELT: I I have n't seen Dr. Kimble . Biggs and Newman exchange a look .
NEWMAN: That 's not what I asked , sir . I just wanted to know if Dr. Kimble and Dr. Lentz knew each other ?
ROOSEVELT: I I do n't know . Excuse me , I got to go .
BIGGS: I think you 're lying to us .
KIMBLE: They 'd be home free if I had n't been leaning on them to account for the livers I was seeing . And I would n't have seen the livers if I had n't told the guys on my service to call me when they had cases that were leeding excessively in surgery .
WAHLUND: Big bucks . One schmuck standing in the way . Easy , get rid of him and his wife . But why Lentz ?
KIMBLE: Why not ? He 's one of the original patent holders . Toss the samples I sent , replace them with healthy samples , issue the path report on the healthy stuff-piece of cake . Kimble notices something in the report .
WAHLUND: Oh , last summer sometime . August Why ? Kimble looks up from the protocol report .
KIMBLE: Because a good third of the samples Lentz approved were signed after he died .
WAHLUND: A pathologist at Devlin-Macgregor ?
KIMBLE: They would n't have had the access . They would have needed someone at the hospital .
WAHLUND: Where are you going ?
KIMBLE: To see an old friend .
POOLE: It 's Newman . Line two .
NEWMAN: The old guy did n't know where he was going . But he picked up some tissue samples .
GERARD: Tissue samples ?
NEWMAN: From a drug study . And signed for by Dr. Charles Nichols . Renfro and Gerard exchange a look .
RENFRO: He was covering for Kimble .
GERARD: Get CPD to bring in Sykes . Gerard stares at the board .
HOST: Tonight to close our conference , we 're honored to hear a report from one of the most respected men in his field
STEVENS: I checked Sykes ' calls for the last two years against Kimble 's like you asked and found nothing .
GERARD: All right . It was a thought .
STEVENS: But when I cross-checked Kimble 's phone records one came up . Gerard looks up .
GERARD: Kimble called Sykes . Renfro ! Get C.P.D . to bring in Sykes !
STEVENS: Night of his wife 's murder - seven-thirty in the evening from his car .
GERARD: Poole ! Bring me Kimble 's arrest eport , now . No , Stevens I believe you .
POOLE: Sam , C.P.D . just checked Sykes ' apartment . He 's not there . As Gerard looks up , we -
SYKES: Back up . Move to the door , Doc .
TRANSIT COP: This is transit unit , 23 . I have a possible sighting of Richard Kimble . Northbound coming into the Balbo station . Request immediate back-up at the station .
SYKES: This is my stop , Doc .
KIMBLE: Good , it 's my stop , too .
TRANSIT COP: Kimble . Sir , move away from him .
SYKES: Go ahead . You do n't have it in you .
KIMBLE: Not as easy as Helen , was it ? You missed your stop .
RENFRO: Balbo station . That 's -
GERARD: Poole , get Biggs and Newman . They 're gone as we -
NEWMAN: C.P.D . just reported -
GERARD: I heard . Was it Kimble ?
BIGGS: Conflicting reports , but the cops are considering him a shooter .
POLICE CAPTAIN: Witnesses say he entered hotel from the subway .
KELLY: Okay . I want it locked down . Start on the lower levels .
GERARD: That 's my man in there , Kelly .
KELLY: Not since he took down one of ours , Gerard . This is a police matter , now . Stay , the hell , out of it .
GERARD: C'mon , I know where he 's going . He moves into the hotel with his deputies .
NICHOLS: And I especially would like to thank my researchers who helped me
KIMBLE: What 's wrong , Charlie ? Surprised ?
CROWD: It 's Richard . It 's Kimble . Stunned expressions .
KIMBLE: After Lentz died , you were the only one that had access to the pathology reports . Nichols remains calm .
NICHOLS: Reports ? What are you ?
KIMBLE: You switched the samples and falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 could get approval .
NICHOLS: Richard , I do n't know what you 're talking about ?
KIMBLE: I have a set of the original samples .
BIGGS: C.P.D . has the perimeter , hotel security has the parking structure .
GERARD: Let them keep busy down below . Newman , get with security . See if you can locate Kimble from the monitors . Keep in radio contact .
NICHOLS: Your best quality , Richard , is that you do n't give up - Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet .
KIMBLE: You missed your chance , Charlie
NEWMAN: I 've got Kimble on the roof with Nichols . Southeast exit .
BIGGS: Keep and eye on him . Biggs has roof plans .
GERARD: I want them covered .
KIMBLE: You took everything away from me for money .
GERARD: This way .
KIMBLE: I want to know , Charlie was it worth it ?
NICHOLS: This thing is bigger than even you think , Richard . You ca n't stop it .
GERARD: Clear the hallway . Get that door open .
KELLY: Bring him down .
GERARD: This is a United States Marshal . Get that helicopter out of here !
RENFRO: There is a U.S . Marshal out there . Hold your fire !
GERARD: Where did the elevator stop ?
NEWMAN: Level five .
GERARD: Get out of here .
GERARD: There is no way out of here . The building is locked down .
GERARD: Nichols borrowed your car the night of the murder and called Sykes from it .
ANOTHER REPORTER: there are unconfirmed reports from police of new evidence which may exonerate Kimble while implicating some of the biggest names in medicine
STUNNED DOCTOR: He just walked in We did n't know what he was going to do . My wife was very frightened The next thing I knew cops were charging in and
REPORTER: Dr. Kimble , is it true you can prove your innocence ! Gerard wants the crowd controlled .
GERARD: Get them back .
BIGGS: Watch your head , Dr. Kimble .
GERARD: Poole , you got that thing ? Give me your hands .
KIMBLE: I thought you told me 'you did n't care . '
GERARD: Yeah , well , do n't spread it around .
GEORGE: Hey , it 's George Simmons , I 'm coming in .
COLLEGE STUDENT: Hey George , can I get a picture with you ?

GIRL: Thanks . You are the funniest .
GEORGE: Thanks , pal .
WOMAN: Is the turkey organic ?
IRA: Yes , ma'am .
WOMAN: Well what does organic mean ?
IRA: It means there 's no additives o preservatives and it 's hormone free .
WOMAN: Are there additives o preservatives in the food they feed the turkey ?
IRA: I do n't know ma'am .
WOMAN: I heard that because turkeys are fatty birds , mercury gets stuck in their fat . My daughter-in-law , she ate turkey and then she had a miscarriage .
IRA: I have n't heard about that . But I may not be informed enough to comment .
WOMAN: Well , you 're not a doctor , so you should n't comment .
IRA: You are correct , I am not a doctor .
CHUCK: I ca n't go through that again , man , that was painful .
IRA: That was five months ago . I 've gotten a lot better .
CHUCK: They pay you yet ?
IRA: Nah , not there . I just hang out and hope somebody does n't show .
CHUCK: Wow , is there anyway for you to.be lower in show business ? I do n't know if you could even say you 're in show business . Why do n't you just fucking settle down and enjoy this gig ? This is a sweet situation . The money 's good , you 've got health insurance .
IRA: Dude , I know you like it here but if I have to work here another yea I would kill myself .
CHUCK: Really ? In that case , when we bury you does it have to be in some kind of Jew cemetery ? Next to Al Jolson or some shit ?
IRA: Just come . I need the support .
CHUCK: No way . I 'm funnier than you . And I 'm not even that funny . I would go if I was paying to see me .
IRA: I 'll pay your cover charge .
CHUCK: Okay , well you better be good , ecause I 'm bringing a date .
IRA: Laughter 's the ultimate lubricant .
LEO: Yeah , something about how the uglier you are , the better the personality you need . And the hotter you are , the stupider you can be .
IRA: I had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot , blonde , homeless women . Because someone will always take care of that kind of woman . That woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world .
LEO: Maybe something like you can be hot and stupid and survive in the world . And you can be smart and ugly and survive in the world . The people who have trouble are the stupid , ugly people .
IRA: That could work .
LEO: Let me keep that one , because I thought of most of it .
IRA: That 's not cool . I came up with the concept ! What do you got ? Let 's work on what you have .
LEO: I 've got nothing in the notebook . I got drunk last night . But I need material , because I just got spots at the Improv . Budd saw me and approved me . I 'm in .
IRA: How could they make you a regular ? I got turned down twice .
LEO: Sorry , man . They 're only going to let in one chubby , caustic Jew , so I think you 're fucked .
MARK: Hey , dudes . You see this check that I got from my TV show fo 25,000 an episode ? There was another one of these on the kitchen counter . Did you see it ?
IRA: No we did n't see it . Just do n't leave those things laying around .
MARK: I would n't leave it around if they did n't give me so many . They give it to me every episode .
LEO: Do n't throw it in our face that you 're on a shitty show .
MARK: I would n't , if it was a shitty show and not what Time magazine called `` insightful and delightful . ''
IRA: I thought you were moving out .
MARK: I decided I like it here . Living with you guys keeps me grounded . I do n't want to be the guy living in the house on the hill . Even though I could afford it . Hey , I saw that girl comic you like who lives upstairs . I invited her in . She 's here .
IRA: She 's in our apartment ? I 've neve even talked to her . I just gave her quarters at the washing machine .

GEORGE: Ah life . What does it mean ? sometimes life makes perfect sense . And then you ` come ' .
IRA: He 's killing the crowd . Jesus , I ca n't follow this shit .
GEORGE: Life is n't all about laughs . Crazy shit happens . You 've got to be nice to each other . You never know what 's going to happen . Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage .
IRA: I 'm not good looking . I 'm not bad looking . I 'm just in the middle . And if I had a personality that was Jut good enough , it would put me over the edge .
GEORGE: Oh I 'm sorry . Let me pull out . George pulls the car back ten feet .
IRA: Thanks !

GEORGE: I thought you and Leo were pretty funny last night and I have to do this corporate gig for Apple computers in a couple of days and I thought you guys could write me some jokes .

GEORGE: I do n't know , about computers and shit . I could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a little .
IRA: No problem . Where do you want me to send em ?
GEORGE: What is your email ? I will send you my fax and email and all that .

GEORGE: There 's some funny shit in here . Not a bad ratio of good jokes to shit .
IRA: Thanks man . I just want to give you a lot of choices .
GEORGE: Too many choices . I do n't like eading that much . I need like ten good jokes . I 'm a little mad you made me read that many to get to ten . But thanks for doing it .

GEORGE: How you doing , you ready for this ?
IRA: Yeah , this 'll be fun .
GEORGE: I think I 'm going to have you go on efore me to warn them up .
IRA: You do n't have to do that . What if I bomb ?
GEORGE: Hey , if you bomb , they 'll just be more excited to see me . They 'll be so glad your not on stage any more . Then if you do well , they 'll be eady for me . Either way , you 're helpful .
IRA: ( turning white from
TAKEOFF: Oh good . Yeah , I thought you 'd like that one . I was really happy with that one .
GEORGE: You want something to eat ? I had them bring Chinese on the plane . Ira 's eyes widen . He likes this way of life .
DAVE: Okay , what do you want them to say when he introduces you ? Do you have any credits he should mention ?
IRA: Uhcredits ? I do n't really have any credits . Maybe you could just say I 've been working on Apples fo so long , my first one weighed more than I did . Nobody laughs .
GEORGE: And just say he 's a friend of mine , and I think he 's funny .
IRA: I panicked . They just wanted jokes about computers .
GEORGE: That 's why I hired you , to write jokes about computers .
IRA: But there 's a lot more . The first three on this page . You did n't think they would work , but I think they will . You should just try them .
GEORGE: They better kill , I 'm getting paid a hundred thousand dollars fo this .
IRA: Are you serious ? ANGLE ON DAVE on stage .
DAVE: Ladies and gentleman , George Simmons .
GEORGE: We 'll be on the ground in a half hour . Want to go to a bar ? Do something fun ?
IRA: Sure . I like fun .
GEORGE: Here 's a grand for the jokes and the gig . Even though you should be paying me after that . Ira 's eyes widen .
IRA: That 's the most money I 've eve made doing anything in comedy .
GEORGE: Then this is an exciting moment .
IRA: Well , I did n't make a hundred grand like you .
GEORGE: I feel nothing . I remember when a grand was the most exciting thing in the world . I 'd go to Red Lobster and go nuts . Now it 's just numbers in a bank account . Enjoy tonight . You made a thousand ucks .
GEORGE: Hey , let 's all go back to my house .
MANDY: Great !
HOPEFUL: Yeah , that sounds like a nice idea .
MANDY: This house is so big . It 's bigge than the college I went to .
GEORGE: Oh there 's a whole other wing that you would n't even know existed unless you went through this door .
MANDY: I want to see , I want to see .
IRA: You are very pretty .
DAWN: I have a boyfriend . Nothing is going to happen .
IRA: I did n't say anything was going to happen . I just said you were pretty . How do you even know I wanted something to happen ?
DAWN: I hope she does n't take a long time .
MANDY: I ca n't believe I 'm having sex with Davey !
GEORGE: He ca n't believe he 's having sex with you .
DAWN: Really ?
GEORGE: Sorry , that kind of stuff happens when you have a big house .
DAWN: Oh , well then I guess I better get going ?
GEORGE: You do n't have to go . I 'm just saying that she left . I think she left her purse in the other wing . Come with me , let 's go get it . Ira watches this , astonished .
DAWN: That sounds awesome .
GEORGE: Yeah , I got Galaga . Let 's go check it out .
IRA: I guess so .
GEORGE: I 'm afraid I did . I 'm sorry . It was just so clear that you were not going to get it done . I figured you would n't mind .
IRA: That is crazy . That is supe crazy .
GEORGE: It was great . It was crazy great .
IRA: How can that even happen ? I guess I understand the first one , but why would the second one do it ? You probably stink of the first girl .
GEORGE: Well , we took a steam showe together .
IRA: What ?
GEORGE: she had never seen a steam showe efore , I told her she should enjoy it .
IRA: She would n't fool around with me ecause she said she had a oyfriend .
GEORGE: She told me that too , but she says I was on her and her boyfriend 's list of people she was allowed to screw . You 'd be surprised how many women have me on that list .
IRA: I should get going .
GEORGE: Just talk to me before I fall asleep . I 'm weird . I do n't like eing alone . You should crash in one of the rooms . You 're too drunk to drive home . I wo n't try to fuck you , I just fucked two women and I 'm kind of done .
IRA: I may have to whack it in you guest room .
GEORGE: Whack away , I do n't give a shit .
BEAT: Hey , you were funny tonight . I could see how you could get good .
IRA: Thanks . That was fun . It was rare that I get to play to more than twenty-five people . I 've neve played for a thousand .
GEORGE: I do feel bad for you , because no matter how hard you try , you 'll never be as funny as me .
IRA: Why would you say that ?
GEORGE: Did your dad crack you on the head when you were a kid ?
IRA: No .
GEORGE: That 's why . My dad always seemed annoyed with me . He 'd always crack me on the head . You would not see it coming . I spent my whole childhood trying to make my dad laugh so he would n't smack me . But he was an awesome guy . He was the coolest . He just got annoyed with me . Do you like your parents ? They ca n't be that bad , because you 're not that funny .
IRA: They 're bananas . And always broke . They got divorced ten years ago , ut they both act like it just happened last week . They hate each other . They always put me in the middle of it . I always wanted them to say , `` We do n't want you to suffer through this , so we 're just going to handle it ourselves . '' They never would do it . They would always make me feel their pain all the time . I would never do that for my kids . Because it 's like they._ ` .re kids . And no matter how many times I tell them to leave me out of it , they never do .
GEORGE: No , keep going . It 's interesting . Tell me about your day job ?
IRA: Alright . So I work at a supermarket at the deli counter . I hate it , but the money 's actually pretty good . Better than you 'd think . But I 'd ather do comedy full-time if I could .
GEORGE: Hey man , you want to make me eakfast ?
IRA: okay .
GEORGE: Do you know how to cook anything ?
IRA: Eggs .
GEORGE: Okay , let 's have some eggs .
IRA: What are you doing , man ? Are those vitamins ?
GEORGE: No . Medicine . I 'm sick .
IRA: What do you got ?
GEORGE: I 've got some crazy blood disease . They think I 'm going to die in six months to a year . Some weird thing , almost nobody has it . All these are experimental .
IRA: Are you fucking with me ? That 's not funny , man .
GEORGE: No , I 'm telling you the truth .
IRA: I never heard that before . That would be a big deal .
GEORGE: I have n't told anybody yet . I do n't think I 'm going to .
IRA: You 're not going to tell anybody ? You told me .
GEORGE: Well it 's easier with you because I do n't know you . I do n't feel weird around you . I do n't want to be treated like a guy who 's going to die .
IRA: I do n't know , man . I do n't think you want to go through this alone . I think you 've got to tell people . Your family . Your friends .
GEORGE: Actually , the reason why I only told you is I need you to do me a favor .
IRA: What ? Anything , man .
GEORGE: I ca n't imagine suffering through the final stages of this . SoI was going to ask you if you would e willingto euthanize me .
IRA: What does that mean ?
GEORGE: Kill me . I figured if I found someone that nobody knew that was a stranger , they could get away with it , and I would n't have to suffer . I got a gun that is untraceable . And a silencer . And I thought maybe tonight , I would take a bunch of sleeping pills , and when I slept you would put a bullet in my head .
IRA: I ca n't do that !
GEORGE: I 'll give you fifty thousand dollars in cash . You 'd be doing me a favor . It would be the kindest thing you could ever do fo somebody .
IRA: Fifty thousand dollars ? Can I at least take a little time to think about it ?
GEORGE: Holy shit , you would do it . You were literally thinking about doing it !
IRA: You 're an asshole .
GEORGE: I 'm an asshole , you were about to kill me . For fifty grand ! That 's not even a lot of money .
IPA: I just got nervous so I was delaying saying no .
GEORGE: You basically just told me that you were willing to be a murderer . While you 're cooking me eggs .
IRA: That 's not cool , man . You told me you 're going to die and you want me to euthanize you . I almost had a heart attack .
GEORGE: Well , I actually am sick . And I 'm not going to survive .
IRA: Do n't do this . My friends do this all the time . They trick me , and then they trick me again . I 'm very gullible . Do n't do it .
GEORGE: I 'm not putting you on , man . Just do n't tell anyone . I mean that . I do n't want people to know about this . I do n't want to feel weird . Ira nods okay .
IRA: Are you religious ? Does that give you any comfort ?
GEORGE: Do you really think I 'm going to sit here and have a theological conversation with you ?
IRA: No .
GEORGE: Maybe later , Father Mulcahy .
MARK: That 's so sad .
LEO: If it was me , I would tell everyone . Then everyone would kiss my ass . And take care of me . Tell me how much they love me .
IRA: He does n't want to be that guy . He picked up two girls at a bar . Then he had sex with his . And then he came out and had sex with mine .
MARK: In front of you ?
IRA: No .
MARK: So being terminally ill makes you a cock-blacker ?
IRA: No , what I 'm saying isHe 's so lost right now that he 's hiding from the world . And he 's trying to distract himself by doing stand-up and having sex with a lot of women . And he does n't want anyone to know ut me .
MARK: Why you ?
IRA: Because he does n't know me . So he does n't give a shit .
LEO: That 's kind of insulting .
IRA: No , I think we had kind of an instant connection . The other roommate , JAY , walks by .
JAY: You fucked him ?
IRA: Shut up , Jay . Jay keeps walking .
LEO: Like how to bang two chicks in the same night , even though you have a terminal disease ?
IRA: No , what is life all about ? What is important ? How should we decide to live this precious life ? REVEAL that Mark is crying .
MARK: Do n't talk about this shit when we 're high . It really freaks me out and it makes me sad and it scares me . I do n't want to talk about this shit .
IRA: That 's why we should talk about it ! You ca n't run from it , man . This could make us into better people . This is an opportunity .
LEO: I do n't want to talk about this shit until I 'm 80 . I 'm 24 years old .
IRA: Well I 'm going to fucking learn something . Mark cries even more .
MARK: When my grandfather died , we were in a room with no windows . And they said he was dead . And there was a candle . And it started flickering like he was blowing it out . But there were no windows .
LEO: You have to go through fire to get to heaven ? That was n't him going to heaven , that was him going to hell .
MARK: Fuck you guys . I was trying to open up . I 'll never do it again . You 're just being mean because I 'm making twenty-five thousand dollars an episode .
IRA: Hello .
GEORGE: Hey . You want to see if we can get on-stage somewhere ?
IRA: Sure .
GEORGE: I was thinking about it . I could throw you some money every week fo coming up with new jokes for me . Maybe you can organize them in the computer , keep track of what I 'm doing .
IRA: Absolutely . What do you want to pay me ? They close the doors , drive off .
GEORGE: I 'll throw you $ 1500 a week .
IRA: Okay , that could work .
GEORGE: I 'm just doing stand-up to have fun , forget about it on stage . There 's nothing funny about that .
IRA: It could be classic stuff . For the ages .
GEORGE: Fuck classic stuff . Ido n't give a shit what people think of my shit when I 'm dead . Why do n't you wait till you 're about to die and then you do a bit about it ? I 'll bet you 're about-to-die shit will be funnier than my about-to-die shit .
DELI MANAGER: I 'm very sorry ma'am . What if you come in and I give you a free sandwich ?
GEORGE: Well that 's very nice of you . But I have one question for you . Can I get two sandwiches ? George motions for Ira to do something .
IRA: Grandma ! Get off the fucking phone . Do n't run up my fucking ill .
DELI MANAGER: Ma'am ! Are you okay ?
GEORGE: This is a family matter ! He can hit me if he wants . He 's my grandson , and I love him ! Now may I give you my name , so you have it on file so I can get my free sandwich ? K-A-C-A-H-A-K-R-E-K-K-U- C-T-A-R-S-U-T-A-R-G-M-S. Did you get that ? Can you say it back to me ?
IRA: George ? George ?
GEORGE: No , I had a bad night last night . I was sweating though the sheets , could n't stop . So I got up , watched half of a season of The Wire and then I slept tillwhat time is it now ?
IRA: It 's three in the afternoon .
GEORGE: I wanted to get up and do something . But I do n't think I have it in me . I may just go back to bed .
IRA: Well do you need anything ?
GEORGE: Yeah , I need all sorts of things . But nothing you can get me . You should go up anyway . You were in a groove the other night , you do n't want to get rusty .
IRA: I . .I . .ca n't anyway . I 'm doing the late shift at the deli counter .
GEORGE: Really ? How long you gon na keep that job for ? I 'm paying you good money . What if someone you perform in front of goes into Ralph 's and sees you cutting turkey ?
IRA: I know , I just want to be safe , make sure I can pay my bills . I do n't like to be nervous about that shit .
GEORGE: I was n't like you . I had a different theory . You 've got to spend money to make money . Nothing makes you work harder than being in debt . Maybe we should go buy a Corvette . That 'll make you try to e funnier .
CHUCK: so how much notice are you giving me ?
IRA: Notice ? I 'm not giving you any notice . I 'm just quitting .
CHUCK: You 're supposed to give notice . That 's what people do .
IRA: Why would I give you notice ? I 'm not trying to stay in Ralph 's good graces . I 'm not trying to preserve my good standing at Ralph 's .
CHUCK: Well I do n't have enough people to cover all your shifts , now I got ta cover them .
IRA: I wish I could help you , but I 'll kill myself if I keep working here . It 's not what I want to do . Maybe Gail can cover my shifts .
CHUCK: Gail ca n't work weekends , and my kid 's birthday is this weekend . What am I supposed to do ?
IRA: I do n't know . Get someone to cove from a different Ralph 's . There are thousands of them in Southern California . No one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl ? I 'm not the linchpin that keeps Ralph 's from falling into chaos .
CHUCK: You 're an asshole . You always thought you were slumming it here . Go tell your tucking fart jokes. , Get the fuck out of here before I kick the shit out of you .
IRA: You know what ? I 'm glad you said that , because I was about to tell you I could work this weekend . What 's your problem ? I did n't say anything bad about you , I just said I did n't want to work for Ralph 's anymore .
DAISY: Hey
IRA: Ira .
DAISY: I know .
IRA: I was gon na try to hunt down tickets to see Wilco at the Greek Theatre . You want to come ? Are you into them at all ?
DAISY: I would love to come . That would e amazing .
IRA: Okay . I 'll call you with the details . Hopefully I 'll be able to get seats which will not require high-powered binoculars .
DAISY: I do n't care where the seats are . I just like to close my eyes and listen to the music at concerts ,
IRA: Perfect . Then I can play you thei live album in my car and trick you into thinking we have front row seats . That wo n't work .
IRA: George ?
GEORGE: ( speaking like an old
WOMAN: I was robbed ! One second you 're walking down the street with you Visa card , having a grand old time , and then you 've got a fucking gun in your mouth !
VISA LADY: What 's the number of the card , Ma'am ?
GEORGE: I do n't know ! The thief has the card , why do n't you ask the thief the number of the card ! George hangs up the phone . He starts dialing .
IRA: I was thinking you need to tell someone about your situation you condition .
GEORGE: No , no . Iâ€¢ do n't want to do that .
IRA: I feel like maybe you 're holding everything in and I can understand why you do n't want to deal with it ecause why would anyone want to deal with it . But I bet you have a lot of unfinished business with your friends . Would n't it make you feel a lot better to get you affairs in order ? What do people do at this moment Do n't they have to do stuff ?
GEORGE: I do n't want to do anything . I just want to be in the moment and live every day the best I can . As soon as I confront it with everybody , everything 's changed and I ca n't get back .
IRA: Everything has changed . At some point you 're going to get really sick and you need your friends and family around you . I 'm sure there 's a lot of business , estate issues , I do n't know . Maybe you 'll feel better than if you just deal with everything . Where are you parents ?
GEORGE: P4y parents would drop dead if I told them what was happening . They 're in their 80s . They do n't have to go through this . I 'll make sure they find out at the last possible second .
IRA: Friends ?
GEORGE: I do n't think I do . I thought I did . I got a lot of people I know , shoot the shit with , fuck around with . But I realized when this happened I 'm not close to anyone . I had no one to call . My friendships are Hollywood friendships . When I was lying in ed I could n't think of one person I wanted to share this with . Maybe it 's me , maybe I never got close to anybody .
IRA: I think if you talk to people you 'd find out a lot of people care about you . You 're kind of old already , I mean , compared to me . I 'm sure you touched a lot of people 's lives . You ca n't spend the rest of you days making phoney phone calls alone in your room .
GEORGE: The only reason I did that was ecause I could n't sleep . And I had no one to call .
IRA: Well maybe that 's the problem . Maybe if you told more people you 'd have more people to call . You ca n't just talk to me about it , I do n't know what the fuck I 'm talking about . You 're the first person I 've known who 's sick . I 'm not good at it . ( eyes beginning to well
UP: You 've given me diarrhea , I 'm nervous about you and I 'm in ove my head .
GEORGE: ( his eyes begin to well
UP: Do n't cry in front of me , man . I ca n't start that .
IRA: I 'm sorry .
GEORGE: Seriously . I can'tI ca n't have you do that . George really begins to cry .
IRA: ( tears streaming down his
FACE: I wo n't do it , I promise , man .
CRYING: You 're still crying .
IRA: I do n't think I am . I think I 'm not anymore . I 'm not sure what you 're talking about .
GEORGE: Okay , as long as we got that straight .
IRA: I 'm sorry , George . I really do n't know what to do , I do n't know how to help you .
GEORGE: ( his face still in the
NAPKIN: No , you 're right . I really should tell some people . It just sucks , man . It just sucks . And they 're going to feel so bad , I do n't even want to look at them and tell them .
IRA: Do you want me to call them , and tell them what 's going on ?
GEORGE: Yeah .
IRA: Fuck . I was hoping you were gon na say no .
GEORGE: So I left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it .
COMEDIAN #1: That 's very gay .
COMEDIAN#2: No , it was a buddy thing . It was very heterosexual .
GEORGE: Admit it , you were masturbating .
COMEDIAN#2: Of course I was whacking it . What else am I gon na do , not whack it ?
GEORGE: And I kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh .
COMEDIAN #2: I think at one point you said , `` Say my hog is the biggest you 've eve seen . '' And then there is this long pause .
COMEDIAN#3: That 's a bad sign . If it was big at all she would n't have paused .
COMEDIAN #1: Remember you used to have that joke about how you used to only date midgets because your dick looked igger in their little hands . They all laugh .
COMEDIAN #2: Yeah , you used to get all the girls , man .
COVERT: You fucking blew us off . You cocksucker .
LISA: You have to tell mom and dad .
GEORGE: I will tell them , but right at the end . I do n't want them to go through all this . I ca n't put them through this .
LISA: I wish I was n't so mad at you . I want to be there for you , but I am so mad at you .
GEORGE: I wish I was a better brother .
LISA: You were n't even a brother . You just left when I was a little kid . You left me there all alone , and you never treated me like a siste again .
GEORGE: You live so far away . I visited you in Kansas a few years ago .
LISA: That was six years ago , and you were only there because you had a concert . My five-year-old has never even met you . George does not know what to say .
GEORGE: Thanks a lot , pal . This is everything I did n't want to happen . It 's like being at my own funeral .
IRA: Afterwards you 'll be happy you did it .
GEORGE: No , I wo n't .
FRIEND: It is such a tucked up situation . Life is fucked . It makes no sense .
GEORGE: Well , I really appreciate you coming by .
FRIEND: This is why I ca n't be close with people . What is the point ?
GEORGE: Exactly . Well , I really need to est
FRIEND: The worst part is at night , when the TV gets turned off , and it is quiet
GEORGE: It was so good to see you .
IRA: I think George is going to take a nap now .
FRIEND: Oh , okay .
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: You 're about to merge with the eternal . We 're all going to die . No one gets out of here alive , ight ? George nods .
GEORGE: I guess so , but
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: You know what ? There is no tomorrow , no yesterday . Only right now , and it 's fucking beautiful .
BEAT: You need to shut the fuck up right now . Have you been browsing the self-help section at Barnes and Noble ? Is this what you say in etween songs these days ? I 'm going to go right now and delete all your songs off my iPod .
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I 'm sorry . I did n't know what to say . I just got nervous .
GEORGE: This is awful . Awful . I hate you for having me do this .
IRA: You have to , you have no choice . You 're doing good . And you 're almost done , do n't worry .
GEORGE: Well what are we going to do when it 's over , when we 're done tomorrow ? Because then I 'm not talking to anyone .
IRA: I was thinking we should go skiing somewhere . You 're still physically doing well , and that 's not going to last forever . You should do something active . Go to Colorado , or Tahoe , or something . Or do something crazy . Go to Switzerland , or Sweden , or wherever they have mountains .
GEORGE: Thanks for coming down . You did n't have to do that , i appreciate it .
LAURA: I wanted to , I wanted to see you .
GEORGE: I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry fo everything I did to you .
LAURA: You do n't have to be sorry , that was like 12 years ago . Everything worked out for the best . We see this hurts George .
GEORGE: I screwed everything up . I could have been married to you now .
LAURA: Do n't do this .
GEORGE: We could 've had a family . I do n't have a family , I 'm all alone here .
LAURA: I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry fo what 's happening to you .
GEORGE: You know , maybe I deserve it . I screwed up the only good thing that ever happened in my life . I cheated on you . For no reason at all . Just young and stupid . And selfish . I 'm sorry .
LAURA: Maybe I over reacted . I did n't have to leave you .
GEORGE: Yes you did .
LAURA: And the funny thing ismy husband , he is on the road a lot for business . He did the same thing last year .
GEORGE: Did you leave him ?
LAURA: No . I have kids now .
GEORGE: See , that was my mistake . I should have had some kids with you before I cheated . she laughs .
LAURA: You were the one and only magic elationship in . my life . She starts to cry . He does too . They embrace .
GEORGE: Me too . They cry , forehead to forehead .
LAURA: There 's never been anything like you before or since . I love Chris , ut it 's not the same . It 's fine , maybe it is n't even fine , but we had something special .
GEORGE: I 'm so sorry . I really loved you . And I do love you .
LAURA: I love you too George . I wish there was something I could do .
GEORGE: Do n't set me up for jokes like that . You 're ruining the moment . She smiles . They hug .
IRA: Hey . How 's it going ?
DAISY: Good . Mark walks out in a bathrobe .
MARK: Oh , I 'm sorry . I thought you were sleeping at your boyfriend 's again tonight .
IRA: I guess it 's been more than ten days .
MARK: It 's been 21 days . I gave you an extra 11 .
DAISY: What are you guys talking about ?
IRA: Do n't worry about it , it does n't matter , I do n't give a shit . Leo walks in the front door .
LEO: I just fucking killed at the Improv . Bud Freidman fucking loves me .
IRA: I 've been getting good weekend spots .
LEO: Well , that 's because they think if they book you , George will show up .
IRA: What 's with you guys ? You both want to fuck my mother too ? What more do you want to do to me tonight ? Ira walks away .
LEO: I really did kill . Did you guys just bone , o something ?
IRA: So now you 're with Mark ? You 're his girl ?
DAISY: I just went out with him one night .
IRA: You got a lot accomplished in one night . How did this happen ?
DAISY: He invited me to a taping of his show and we hit it off .
IRA: Must have been a great episode . I should get a job on a shitty show so I can use it as foreplay .
DAISY: What are you talking about ? Do n't treat me like that .
IRA: I am not treating you like anything . Do what you want . I do n't give a shit . I 'll go to Wilco alone .
DAISY: What planet are you from ? The one where everyone is perfect like you , you judgemental fuck ?
IRA: How could you do that ? I thought we were going out on a date .
DAISY: We are going on a date . I did n't plan it . Am I not allowed to do stuff because we 're going out on a .date ? What the fuck 's the matte with you ?
IRA: I bought tickets to Wilco and I worked all week to get a eservation at a place that does n't normally let people like me eat there . I just did n't see this coming . Yes , you 're right . You can do anything you want . I 'm glad this fucking happened , before I wasted the night with you . I did n't think you were that kind of person . That you would sleep with a guy like that .
DAISY: He 's your roommate . You do n't like him ?
IRA: No , I think he 's a pussyhound .
DAISY: Well , I did n't know that . Thanks for the info . I was n't trying to hurt you . It just happened .
IRA: You got excited because he 's the star of the show . You literally star-fucked .
DAISY: Yes , you 're right . I 'm awful .
CRYING: Give me a break . I do n't even know you .
MARK: I told you I was going to give you 10 days . That was three weeks ago .
IRA: I thought you were joking .
MARK: I did n't know she actually mattered to you . We talk about girls we want to fuck all the time .
IRA: I just bought these two Wilco tickets . Wan na go ?
MARK: I would , but I 'm going with Tobey Maguire . He wants me to play his younger brother in some movie .
GEORGE: You know , I never got married . I never had kids . I did n't get to do a lot of things I thought I would do . But I was pretty fucking funny , right ?
IRA: Come on , are you kidding me ? We all want to be you . Most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you . People love your shit .
GEORGE: Well , I made a lot of people laugh . I guess that 's something .
IRA: It 's a lot .
GEORGE: Yeah . I guess so .
GEORGE: I never understood why people hiked efore . I think I get it now .
SWEATING: I do n't .
IRA: What are you doing ?
GEORGE: I 'm feeling good , so I 'm going to the doctor .
IRA: You 're not feeling good ?
GEORGE: No , I 'm feeling good . It 's kind of weirding me out .
DOCTOR STEVENS: I do n't want to get your hopes up . We put you on this experimental medication without much optimism , ut as of right now I do n't see any traces of the disease in your blood work . I do n't want to speak too soon , but we may have beaten this thing .
GEORGE: Well what the fuck do I do now ?
IRA: Oh my god , oh my god !
GEORGE: I really want to thank you for you help through this time .
IRA: I was happy to help .
GEORGE: Well , you did n't have to , and you were really there for me . I was thinking , maybe we should write a movie together .
IRA: Uh-huh .
GEORGE: I feel like I 've learned a lot , and I wan na use this good place I 'm in ight now to do something really creative . I would pay you , certainly . I make , you know , about a million dollars to write a script . I ca n't give you half , but maybe one hundred , two hundred grand , but we 'll figure it out .
IRA: Yeah , we 'll figure it out .
GEORGE: I thought a lot about my work when I was sick and I 'm in sort of a strange place career-wise , because I 'm normally the goofy , funny guy and I do n't know if people are expecting a change from me . And I think people are expecting me to evolve , and it 's important to evolve before they make a point of asking me why I 'm not evolving .
IRA: It 's always good to keep breaking new ground .
GEORGE: Is that something they taught you at the deli . I 'm not asking you for your advice , I just though we could start trying to come up with an idea .
IRA: Well , I 'm gon na start thinking . AndI 'm really happy for you . Are you freaking out right now ?
GEORGE: It 's very strange . It 's gon na take me a few days to process it , but it 's a gift and I 'm going to treat it that way .
IRA: And he thanked me for helping him , and I really think I was a help during this time . I 'm not saying that 's why he got better , but he definitely had good energy and I hear that helps your immune system .
MOM: He 's going to pay you two hundred thousand dollars to write a movie script ?
IRA: I do n't know , he said one or two hundred thousand .
BOB: One or two hundred thousand ? That 's pretty vague . That 's a wide ange . I 'd push him toward two hundred thousand if I were you .
IRA: Thank you for the advice , Bob . That 's very helpful .
MOM: This is good because now you can help with your sister 's college tuition .
IRA: What are you talking about ?
MOM: Your younger sister got accepted to Boston University but , as you know , your father and I are n't in the position to pay for it .
IRA: So I have to ? I just stopped working at a supermarket two weeks ago . I 'm trying to create some financial stability for myself . The first time I make any real money , I ca n't just give it to her .
BOB: Well that 's very selfish .
IRA: Well you guys went on a cruise to Greece last year . Maybe you should n't have gone , and saved fo her college education .
MOM: Oh , so after all we 've done fo you , we ca n't have any fun ? We should never take a vacation ?
IRA: I had to drop out of college afte two years because you could n't pay for it . Now I have to pay fo hers ? Let her figure it out . Let her get a job .
BOB: I did n't realize I raised such a selfish boy . When I was young I would have done anything for my family .
IRA: Then sell your house . Move into a smaller house . Use the extra money to pay for her college . Or tell her to work for a year or two , make some money , then she can pay fo her own college . No one helped me out , I 'm just digging out from under now .
BOB: Do n't get so high up on your horse with all your Hollywood friends . I do n't like what you 're turning into .
IRA: One good thing happens to me in my entire life , and you have to try and take it away and ruin it .
MOM: I do n't even know where you came from .
BOB: Do n't bother showing up fo Thanksgiving . Thanksgiving is just for families .
IRA: Hey George , we 're doing an Orphan 's Thanksgiving tomorrow night , want to come ? It 's just for us losers who do n't have any family to eat with .
LEO: He 's not gon na email back .
MARK: He 's never gon na want to eat Thanksgiving with us .
IRA: Sure . What time ? Do you need me to bring anything ? 3 O'clock at my apartment . Bring wine that we ca n't afford . The computer bings .
EXCITED: Email back and say If you can , bring that hot chick from your last movie . We definitely have room for her .
ALT: Well , then maybe just bring grain alcohol then .
IRA: Hey Faggots , I know what you 're doing . Stop emailing me . It 's not amusing anymore . They all start highfiving .
LEO: He called us faggots !
DAISY: What have you been up to ? I have n't seen you at the Improv .
IRA: I 've just been busy . Will you excuse me ? Ira gets up , walks out of the room .
LEO: Hey , George . How are you ? Come on in .
MARK: Happy Thanksgiving ? Come on in .
LEO: We 're really glad you could come have Thanksgiving with us . It 's a ig thrill .
GEORGE: It 's weird , I feel like the old guy in the room . When I started out I was always the young guy . It 's strange how fast you become the old guy . And I feel exactly the same .
MARK: Well , you do n't know us , but you 're with friends and admirers .
GEORGE: I know you , I 've watched your show . `` 'Nuff Said . '' It 's a good show .
IRA: You do n't have to lie to him . He knows it 's not good .
GEORGE: No , it 's good , it 's cute . I like it .
BASHFUL: I know it 's not that funny , but they do slip in some funny shit in there every now and again .
GEORGE: Do n't be ashamed , it 's good . But what about that girl on the show ? How old is she ? Tell me she 's 25 .
MARK: No , she 's 15 .
GEORGE: Holy shit ! I feel bad . I do n't want to tell you what I did watching that show . Are you serious ? She 's 15 ?
MARK: No , she 's actually 20 .
GEORGE: Okay , good . Now I do n't feel so ad . Their weird friend , FUTORAN , pipes up .
FUTORAN: I heard you were sick and now you 're better . Is that like , eally what 's that like ?
GEORGE: It 's kinda like 9/11 . You know after 9/11 you kind of liked everybody ? But then it went away . It 's like that .
LEO: Did you think you were gon na go to heaven ? Did you count up you sins ?
GEORGE: I do n't believe in any of that stuff , but I was hoping I was headed somewhere . I felt like I was .
FUTORAN: I think you just wind up in the dirt . Worm food .
IRA: Come on , Futoran , we 're about to eat .
GEORGE: Well , it 's easy to think that way until you 're headed for the dirt . Then your mind opens up a little it , you know ? Maybe it 's desperation , or maybe you just start to see more of the big plan . Luckily I got a little more time efore I find out . Daisy pops her head into the room .
DAISY: Food 's ready .
GEORGE: May I say the prayer ? Everyone nods yes .
LEO: Why would n't I have sent you jokes ? You did n't ask me for jokes .
GEORGE: Sure I did . I asked you and Ira to write me jokes and you flaked . Leo 's eyes widen with anger .
IRA: I do n't want to right now .
GEORGE: It was like , what 's great about . Leopard is you can watch a porno , write a porno , shoot a porno , and order a porno all at the same time . This guy 's fucking funny .
DAISY: well , the truth is we had a date , ut I went out with Mark first and he broke it off .
IRA: I did n't expect you to blurt it out like that . That was very honest of you .
GEORGE: If I did n't go out with every girl one of my friends slept with let me put it another way . If none of my friends went out with girls I went out with , none of them would have gotten laid .
THEN: So , are you guys dating now ?
DAISY: No .
IRA: This is making me uncomfortable . The whole thing , it makes me uncomfortable .
GEORGE: You guys are young , why are you taking everything so seriously ? As someone who 's been through a lot ecently , let me tell you something . The worst thing you can do is hold grudges and be judgmental . Everyone 's making mistakes , everyone 's screwing up . You guys are cute together . George points at Mark .
DAISY: Actually , I have a really skinny vagina , so I 'm not really into thick .
GEORGE: See ? She 's funny . She can take a joke , she 's not sensitive . I think I 'm falling in love with both of you .
DAISY: My brother 's going to freak out that I met Davey . Did you go to the Wilco show ?
IRA: I actually scalped them and made a hundred bucks .
DAISY: Well at last you did n't lose any money on the deal .
IRA: I 'm sorry I got so upset with you , ecause it shows you how much I like you , which is weird because we 've hardly spoken . I understand all of that .
DAISY: Well , attraction is all about smells , pheromones .
IRA: Well , you smell right to me .
LEO: You 're a fucking prick , You 're a piece of shit thief motherfucker . You stole a job from me , you stole my joke .
DAISY: You stole his joke ?
LEO: He asked for me to write jokes too and you did n't tell me !
IRA: Uhyes .
LEO: You .fucker !
IRA: I did n't think you would want to .
LEO: Why would n't I want to ? What , I do n't like money ? I do n't like private jets ?
IRA: I 'm sorry , it 's just , I needed the gig . And you are doing so much etter than me . I guess I just wanted this for myself .
LEO: It was n't yours to keep fo yourself . You lied to me .
IRA: I did . And it was fucked up . And I am sorry . I do n't know what to say .
LEO: Do n't say anything . Just get you shit , and get out of the apartment .
IRA: Are you serious ?
LEO: You do n't get let off the hook fo going into faggy apology mode . That is a terrible strategy .
IRA: I never told Leo because I wanted the gig ?
GEORGE: I did n't know you were fucking ove your friend . Do n't yell at me .
IRA: Well I fucking live with you now ecause he told me to leave .
GEORGE: He kicked you out for that .
IRA: He said friends do n't lie and I 'm fucking with his career .
GEORGE: Well in a way that 's a compliment to me because he 's so mad he ca n't hang out with me that 's he mad at you . That 's kind of cool . I got you kicked out .
IRA: Fuck off .
GEORGE: This should be comfortable in here . This room is almost as big as you old apartment .
IRA: Thank you for letting me stay here .
GEORGE: No problem . Hey , you want to come talk to me while I crash ?
IRA: No . You want to come talk to me while I crash ?
GEORGE: All right , Charlie . Talk to me . George closes his eyes .
RECEPTIONIST: Terry 's ready for you .
GEORGE: I was thinking that now might be a good time for me to make that script `` Making Amends . ''
TERRY: Do you really think people want to see you make a movie about a guy who goes to AA but is n't really an alcoholic ? He just needs the companionship ? That 's a pretty big left turn .
GEORGE: I got money . I want to challenge myself . You said you liked it .
TERRY: You know , I read it four years ago . I need to read it again . I do n't emember not liking it . I just ca n't tell you the studio will make it . Your last few movies did n't do so well .
GEORGE: I thought they did well overseas .
TERRY: You always do well in Australia , ut that 's about it .
GEORGE: What if I do it for no money , just with back-end ?
TERRY: I do n't know if that 's going to cut it either . The head of the studio does a lot of drinking , I do n't think he finds that whole area funny . Maybe if you commit to do another one of the Davey movies , I could tie it to that , so they have to do both .
GEORGE: I'vedone four Davey movies.They wantme to do another sequelto that ? We do n't even have ascript .
TERRY: Wellthere 's this great script goingaround town , Happy Holidays . Whichis about an immature 40 yea old man who acts like a kid . In it he comes home for the holiday season for the first time in ten years . And havoc ensues . You get to make fun of Thanksgiving , and Hanukkah and Christmas and New Years . They say they can turn it into a Davey movie .
GEORGE: Could I at least shoot the Making Amends movie first ?
TERRY: No .
GEORGE: Maybe I 'll just write something myself .
TERRY: I wish you would . You 've neve een able to do it in the past . You always talk a big game about writing your own shit . But I 've yet to see a script land on my desk .
IRA: See , the thing I was thinking , wasyou always play an immature guy . What if the joke of the movie is you 're incredibly smart , intellectual and well-mannered . You just go the opposite way with it .
GEORGE: There 's nothing funny about being smart . All comedy comes from immaturity . Buster Keaton , Jerry Lewis , the Marx Brothers , WC Fields , Bill Murray , Steve Martin , Charlie Chaplin . They were all immature . They were all knuckleheads . Who wants to see a smart guy live his life normally ? What 's funny about that ? What else you got ?
IRA: I . .I got ta go through my notes .
GEORGE: I 'm thinking about taking a gig , and having a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground .
IRA: Well we 'll still write the script , ight ?
GEORGE: Yeah , if we can come up with an idea .
IRA: Let 's just keep banging at it .
GEORGE: I ca n't . I 've got a date .
IRA: You have a date ? Who do you have a date with ?
GEORGE: This woman my agent set me up with . She raises money for this environmental group . I guess she 's like a normal person . I ca n't live here alone in this house forever . I need something of significance in my life . So I 'm gon na go out on some dates . No pressure .
IRA: You know what you should do , just as an experiment ? You should try and not fuck her ?
GEORGE: Why would you say that ?
IRA: Because you 're always saying you do n't know if women like you fo who you are . You do n't know if they like you because you have money or you 're famous . Why not take some time and get to know them efore ass-raping them . In a omantic way .
GEORGE: That 's insulting . Do n't take out your frustrations on me because you ca n't get laid by acting like I 'm some sort of deviant . I 'm an adult . I have adult sexual elationships . No one does what they do n't want to do . Sex is how people decide if they like each other . I 'm testing my compatibility by ass-raping them .
IRA: See , you ca n't do it . You ca n't even entertain the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with them .
GEORGE: That 's not true . I 'm bored of sex , anyway . There is literally no body- part/orifice combination I have n't experimented with . There is nothing left to do . There is no nationalities I haven't.slept with , no age groups I have n't slept with . I 'm fully ready for normal .
IRA: What nationalities have you slept with ?
GEORGE: US . Canada . Mexico . England . France . Spain . North Korea . Burma . Rwanda . Kenya . Tibet . Serbia . Chechnya . Iran . The Green Zone . Darfur . The Killing Fields of Cambodia . Mongolia . What about you ?
IRA: New Jersey . Do handjobs count ? Because then also California .
GEORGE: You know , I have n't been out on a lind date , ever . This may be the first one .
RACHEL: Oh I go out on them all the time . I 've been on a bunch of J Dates .
GEORGE: What 's J Date ?
RACHEL: It 's a website where Jewish people find each other .
GEORGE: So it 's just a list of all the Jewish people ? I thought we did n't liked to be tracked and monitored like that . She looks at him , does n't get the joke .
RACHEL: It 's just a great way for like- minded people to meet .
GEORGE: What if you do n't like Jews ? She just stares at him .
RACHEL: It is , because , fixing the environment is really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and corporations so they 're forced to observe the environmental statutes that are already on the books . We also try to put pressure on the government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their environmental act . You know , one dilapidated factory in China can produce more pollution than every car in America puts out in one year .
GEORGE: See ? That 's why I still drive a ig truck . I stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down .
RACHEL: I know you 're joking , but it 's a very serious situation . People like you do a lot of damage to the environment . Whether it 's taking a private jet by yourself , or getting driven around town limos around town or living in your gas-guzzling houses . Your carbon footprint is huge .
GEORGE: You know what they say about people with a big carbon footprint ? Big dick .
IRA: How big a theater ?
GEORGE: I think two thousand .
IRA: You should have told me so I could have prepared . I 've never played a place that big . How long do you want me to do ?
GEORGE: Twenty minutes . Thirty , if you can get there .
IRA: Shit .
GEORGE: Dress nice . Tickets are expensive .
IRA: I do n't own anything nice .
IRA: How fucking up north is this ?
GEORGE: Its near San Francisco .
IRA: So we have like five more hours to drive ?
GEORGE: It 's not that far . It 's like two more movies .
IRA: I do n't like how you made me you limo driver . It 's weird you 're in the back and I 'm up here .
GEORGE: I 'd sit up front but the DVD playe is back here .
IRA: I ca n't even listen to the radio ecause you 're watching the movie . Can I sit back there and you drive ?
GEORGE: No . I 'm near-sighted . I 'll miss the exit . We Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie .
IRA: What happened ?
GEORGE: The monster showed himself .
SARCASTIC: Great .
GEORGE: Hey , you made it .
LAURA: I would n't have missed it for the world , thanks for inviting me .
GEORGE: You remember Ira .
LAURA: Hi Ira . Are you performing tonight ?
IRA: I 'm afraid so . I 've been told if I 'm good it warms the crowd , and if I 'm bad it makes them want George more , so
LAURA: You look great . How are you feeling ?
GEORGE: I 'm hanging in there .
LAURA: I thought a lot about you after I left .
GEORGE: Me too .
LAURA: Well the show is going to start in a minute , I better get to my seat . I just wanted to say hi . Do n't be too dirty tonight , you know that makes me uncomfortable .
GEORGE: Now I have no jokes . Ira , you have to do an hour and half . She laughs .
LAURA: Okay . Break a leg . She exits .
IRA: You did n't tell her that you 're not sick anymore ? Why would n't you tell her ?
GEORGE: I need you to do something for me . After your set I gave you a seat ight next to her . During the intermission I want yQ.u to tell he I 'm not sick anymore .
IRA: Me ? Why do you want me to tell her ?
GEORGE: Because it 's weird , and emotional . I think she 'll handle it better if it comes from somebody else . And then I can talk to her about it afterwards .
IRA: That 's weird .
GEORGE: She 'll be happy . It 's not weird . You 're the bearer of good news .
IRA: You had to do this to me right efore my set . Like I 'm not nervous enough .
LAURA: Ira . Oh my gosh . You were so good .
IRA: You seem surprised .
LAURA: I do n't know , you seemed so nervous . But you were really solid all the way though , and your ending hunk really murdered .
IRA: Thank you . Hopefully George wo n't e mad if I tired the audience out .
LAURA: I do n't think he has anything to worry about . They always go crazy for him . Before he got famous , he used to bomb all the time .
IRA: So you guys were dating right when he started doing well ?
LAURA: Yeah . But you always knew he was gon na do well . He had so much charisma . He would walk into a oom and in ten minutes that whole oom would be about him . Even efore anyone knew who he was .
IRA: Where did you meet him ?
LAURA: I was the hat-check girl at the Improv . And I was acting . I used to do guest spots on all those shows , like Melrose Place , Beverly Hills 90210 . I always played the itch . I do n't know why , but I was on the top of the bitch list .
IRA: You do n't seem like a bitch .
LAURA: That 's because I was acting .
IRA: Sounds like fun days .
LAURA: It was , for awhile .
IRA: I do n't know if you 've heard , but it looks like George 's medicine is working .
LAURA: What do you mean ?
IPA: When George got sick they did n't think they had any medicine that would help , so they put him on experimental medicine . And the last time he went to the docto they could n't detect his blood disease . They think it might be gone . A moment as Laura takes this in .
LAURA: Why did n't George tell me ?
IRA: He just found out . He does n't want to jinx it . He does n't want people to get excited , and then have it come back again . The lights go down .
JOKING: I thought everyone came to see me .
LAURA: I really do n't know what to say . It 's not like you were n't good efore , but your act is so much more sophisticated , but just as funny . I 've never seen you speak so honestly on stage before . You used to say these goofy jokes . It was really something , you know , and you should be really proud of yourself .
GEORGE: Thanks . A lot has happened . And at least I got some good jokes out of it .
LAURA: Well , thanks for inviting me . I 'm eally glad I came .
GEORGE: Ira and I are driving out of town tomorrow , I thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out . I want to see what the ranch looks like , and meet your husband .
LAURA: My husband is actually in China fo another week , or so . He spends a lot of time there helping American usinesses break into that market . So you wo n't meet him this time , ut it would be great if you came y . That would be fun . I 'll give you the tour .
GEORGE: Okay . We 'll come by in the morning .
LAURA: Okay .
IRA: Why do we have to stop by there tomorrow ? The drive is long enough as it is .
GEORGE: Here 's your money for tonight . Good job .
IRA: I 'm excited to see her ranch . I hear it 's delightful .
GEORGE: What 's the fun in that ? You can go pay for your own room , I do n't care .
IRA: So , what happened with you and Laura ? You seem to get along so well . Why did you cheat on her ?
GEORGE: I was young , stupid and I liked fucking girls . Why do you think I cheated ? You would do it too if anyone would fuck you .
IRA: How many times did you cheat on her ?
GEORGE: Two or three times a week for a couple of years .
IRA: Jesus .
GEORGE: It was awful . There was even marriage talk . My parents did n't want me to do it because she was n't Jewish . She was taking classes to convert , even . I mean , how cool is that ? She was changing religions to be with me . She knew more about eing a Jew than I did from those classes . She was so cute when she spoke Hebrew , it sounded so wrong .
IRA: Why do you want to go see he tomorrow ? We could do something productive like get some writing done .
GEORGE: I like her . I love her . I miss her . I just want to spend a little time with her . I know nothing will come of it . I just miss being around her .
IRA: I do n't want to watch adult movies with you .
GEORGE: okay . You want to watch Juno ?
IRA: Okay .
GEORGE: Yeah , of course I am . Laura opens the door .
LAURA: Hi ? We 've been waiting for you . Come on in .
GEORGE: This place is beautiful .
LAURA: Thanks . We 've been here for five years . I think I just finished decorating it .
IRA: Can I live here ?
LAURA: of course , you can clean the stables .
GEORGE: You have horses ?
LAURA: Yes . Clarke , my husband , was a eal city boy . But for some reason he loves horses . Of course I 'm lef t to take care of them . But yes , we have three horses .
IRA: That 's crazy , owning a horse . I ca n't even keep a goldfish alive .
GEORGE: All right , well , we 're ready fo the big tour . I want to see how you live .
INGRID: Mom ! You said you were coming ack ! We 're playing American Idol , you 're ruining the game !
LAURA: I 'll come right up . This is my friend , George . And Ira .
INGRID: It 's my turn to sing and you 're supposed to be the judge and you 're not in there and I 'm very angry !
IRA: How old are you ?
INGRID: Five . But I turn six very soon .
IRA: Really ? Because I thought you were like nine , about to turn ten .
GEORGE: She 's very pretty . I like your hair .
INGRID: I 'm so sick of people telling me they like my hair . George is clearly not that good with kids .
GEORGE: Okay . I do not like your hair .
INGRID: Do n't make fun of me .
LAURA: He 's just joking Ingrid .
IRA: My hair . I have curly hair too . Curly hair is the best .
INGRID: Last week my mom straightened it and it almost went to the floor .
IRA: If you straighten my hair , I look crazy . I look like the killer from No Country for Old Men . Have you seen that movie ?
MABLE: You guys left me all alone in the playroom ! If you 're gon na leave I 'm just gon na go talk on the webcam with Caroline .
LAURA: Do n't be rude . This is Ira and George .
MABLE: Oh , I know you . My mom watches your movies all the time . But most of them I 'm not allowed to see .
GEORGE: Oh , really ? Do you like them ? Which one 's your favorite ?
MABLE: I do n't know . I do n't really like the ones I 'm allowed to see , but I think I would like the ones I 'm not allowed to see . But she says I cant ' see them till I 'm sixteen .
GEORGE: Sixteen ? Just fast-forward past the bad parts .
LAURA: The whole thing is a bad part .
SINGS: You 've got the best of both worlds . Rock it out take it slow . And then you rock out the show ! Everyone applauds for her .
LAURA: Okay . Now it 's time to see what the judges say . I thought you had a lot of energy , you 're clearly gon na make it to the final four , and I love your outfit . What do you think , Randy ?
IRA: Yo , dawg . That was the bomb . It was a little pitchy in places , but I dug it . I really dug it .
MABLE: .I 'm Simon , and I thought it was horrible . I do n't how you made it this far in the competition .
LAURA: Mable , stop it . Stop being mean to your sister . Say something nice .
ANNOYED: You were good .
LAURA: Okay , you 're not Simon anymore . Simon , what did you think ?
GEORGE: I ca n't believe I 'm saying this , ut I agree with Paula . I think you 're the one to beat .
LAURA: Okay Mable , you 're up .
SINGING: I want to go down like London , London .
LAURA: I told you not to do that . Simon , what do you think ?
INGRID: She was horrible ! She 's a terrible singer ! She 's inappropriate !
LAURA: Okay , who 's next ? Randy ?
IRA: I do n't know , Dawg . It was a bad song choice . I 'm not feeling it .
GEORGE: My turn . Get ready to be blown away .
SINGING: Take me down to the paradise city . Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty . Oh , wo n't you please take me home .
FASTER: Just an urchin livin ' under the street , I 'm a hard case that 's tough to beat . I 'm your charity case so buy me somethin ' to eat . I 'll pay you at another time ! Take it to the end of the line !
MABLE: Boo !
INGRID: Boo !
GEORGE: What ? It 's Paradise City , by Guns and Roses .
INGRID: You sound like a girl !
MABLE: Vote him off !
LAURA: All right ! Here we go .
GEORGE: Ira , Laura invited us to stay ove for dinner .
IRA: But it 's like a seven , eight hou drive home . If we stay for dinner , we 're not going to get home till like four in the morning . George stares at Ira for a beat , then
GEORGE: Do n't worry , we 'll figure it out . You have something to do in the morning ?
IRA: No .
GEORGE: Then everything will be fine .
LAURA: Me and George are gon na go to the supermarket and buy some food so I can cook dinner . You think you 'll e okay watching the kids ? It 'll only take forty-five minutes .
IRA: Sure . I 'm great with kids . I was a camp counselor for five years . Camp Winadu . Kids love me . I 'm like a human teddy bear .
GEORGE: This town is so small and adorable . It 's like out of a Demi Moore movie .
LAURA: Clarke 's company is about forty- five minutes from here . This town seemed so perfect when we were looking for a house . There 's no traffic , there 's one coffee house , one bookstore , one market . No crime . But after you 've lived he a few years you hunger for anothe coffee shop , a bigger bookstore , and a little crime . It gets so oring . And it 's such a small town , God forbid you miss one of you kid 's soccer games , they put the scarlet letter on you .
GEORGE: it ca n't be that bad . You live on a pretty little ranch . You have horses , a duck . It must be a nice life .
LAURA: We used to have so much fun . I do n't think I have that much fun anymore . I do n't like who I 'm turning into . Is the fun over ? I have to get up every morning at six , drive my kids to school and then I have 6 hours before I have to pick them up . I have to yell at them to do their homework , be a taskmaster , then I make them dinner .
GEORGE: I could n't believe you moved out of LA . You were getting some good jobs as an actress . You got to play the bitch on Melrose Place fo awhile and make out with Andrew Shue . That was pretty good . Do you miss it ?
LAURA: Yes . Being a mom is very fulfilling , but there are othe parts of me and every once in awhile I go a little crazy .
GEORGE: How do you go crazy ?
LAURA: I just get bored and depressed . And you know how my PMS is kind of out of control . This little boy hit Ingrid in school , and his mom acted like she did n't care at all , so I told her to fuck off . They both laugh .
GEORGE: Oh , that must have gotten ugly . How long did that stay awkward for ?
JOKING: Always . That woman hates me . And I hate her . And now our kids eally like each other , so it 's eally fucked up .
GEORGE: Maybe you were n't acting on Melrose Place .
LAURA: Screw you .
GEORGE: well I do n't anymore . I have n't cheated on anybody since you . I have n't even been in a committed elationship since you , so it 's impossible for me to have cheated .
LAURA: That 's both flattering and deeply disturbing .
GEORGE: I thought a lot about you when I was sick , and I would do anything for another chance . I know it creates a mess , but I think it would be worth it . I think we both know it 's what we should be doing . He kisses her .
LAURA: We ca n't go the supermarket .
GEORGE: Why ?
LAURA: Because people will see us .
GEORGE: So ? What 's wrong with that ?
LAURA: Well it 'll be weird because we 're about to do something we should n't do .
IRA: If you had an Exacto knife we could cut these sticks in half and make a chimney .
SADLY: When is George gon na die ?
INGRID: George is gon na die ?
IRA: Why would you say that ?
MABLE: I heard my mom talking to he friend about it on the phone and crying .
INGRID: I do n't want George to die .
MABLE: What do you care ? You just met him .
IRA: George is gon na be fine .
MABLE: They told me my grandfathe would n't die , but he did .
IRA: Here 's the truth . George was eally sick .
MABLE: I think my mom 's in love with him .
GEORGE: Does somebody in your family like sports ?
LAURA: I really never thought I was going to see you again . I grieved fo you like you were dead . They continue to kiss . Suddenly she stops .
GEORGE: Then let 's not do it .
LAURA: I got ta get back to the kids .
IRA: You 're back . That was quick .
GEORGE: The town is beautiful .
IRA: Where are the groceries ?
LAURA: We decided ordering in might be a little more fun .
CLARKE: The man I was supposed to have a meeting with had a heart attack , if you can believe that . So I decided to try and sneak home for a few days before my next set of meetings .
GEORGE: Oh . Hello .
CLARKE: Hello .
LAURA: Oh , Clarke . George had a performance last night in town , which I went to , and him and his opening act , Ira , came by to say hello on their way out of town .
CLARKE: It is really nice to meet you , George . Laura talks about you all the time , and we 're obviously big fans of your movies .
GEORGE: Well , thank you . You 've got a great family and a great home .
LAURA: I 'm so glad you 're home , honey .
IRA: What 's taking so long with the pizza ?
NERVOUSLY: This is really great pizza . Thank you very much .
GEORGE: Sounds like your business is going very well .
CLARKE: People never thought China would do this much business with us , you know , but it did n't seem like a isky proposition for me . They 've got a billion people , we make all kinds of cool shit in America , they start finding out about it on the internet and what-not . Soone or later they 're gon na find a way to get our shit .
LAURA: He speaks Chinese . For real . Ingrid yells at something in Chinese .
CLARKE: You do n't think they want new mobile phones ? A new X-box ? I 'm trying to get access into North Korea , no shit . That situation could chance overnight . That is a huge market waiting to be tapped . It 's already starting in Cuba .
IRA: My friend backpacked across China and he caught some sort of virus o something from what he ate . He was sickforweeks . He still has it . It'sthekind of thing you ca n't getridof , you have it for the estofyour life , but it stays dormant .
CLARKE: So , George . How are you holding up ?
GEORGE: UhI 'm hanging in there .
CLARKE: How are you feeling ?
LAURA: He 's doing really well . He 's been very strong .
CLARKE: It 's a terrible situation . I 'm so sorry .
GEORGE: I appreciate that .
LAURA: He 's been fighting the good fight . His doctors are taking very good care of him .
CLARKE: You 're a tougher man than me . I do n't know how I could go about my day with that hanging over my head .
GEORGE: It just makes you appreciate every moment . It brings things into focus , you suddenly realize what 's important in life .
LAURA: Does anybody want seconds ? O should I bring out the desert ?
IRA: I 'd love desert . What do you have ? Do you have any ice cream or cake , or anything like that ? I have a eal big sweet tooth right now . Why do n't we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream bar with kids ight now ? I 've got a better idea , I make a really good milkshake . We should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in the kitchen .
CLARKE: Do you know who might be able to help you ? A Chinese doctor . Have you explored Eastern medicine at all ?
LAURA: Now 's not the time to talk about this .
CLARKE: I 'm trying to help the man .
GEORGE: No , I have n't .
CLARKE: Hey . I 'm the last guy who would uy into that shit , but it works .
LAURA: He really is the last guy who would uy into that shit .
CLARKE: Our country 's only two hundred years old . The Chinese have been around for thousand of years figuring this shit out . How I got into it , I had acid ref lux and nothing was working and then this guy at work turned me onto a Chinese doctor and he gave me some herbs that tasted like dogshit , but they worked .
NERVOUSLY: I take herbs for my PMS . They eally helped .
MABLE: Daddy , you 've been cursing a lot . You owe me a dollar for every curse . I think you owe me fifty dollars .
INGRID: This conversation is scaring me . I do n't want George to die .
CLARKE: You girls can go play in the othe oom . The Chinese have a completely different way of looking at health . They do n't think doctors should attack the diseases in the body , they 're all about trying to support the body and make it stronger , so the body can fight off the disease . It works . I 've seen it . I wish I could find a way to mass-market Chinese medicine in this country . Someone 's gon na do it and make a fuck-load of money . Because these people get old , really old . You ca n't kill these people .
IRA: Either that or they 're all young and they just look like shit . Clarke laughs .
CLARKE: This guy 's funny . You should be opening up for this guy . Hey , who wants a drink ?
GEORGE: You ever see Laura act ? She was quite an actress in her day .
LAURA: George , stop .
CLARKE: That 's what I hear . Ca n't say I watched that much 'Melrose Place ' ack in the day . She keeps telling me to watch the videos but , you know , I was never a big 'Party of Five ' fan .
LAURA: Well , I also ran a theatre company . And it was down to me and Cameron Diaz for 'The Mask . ' I sacrificed a lot for our family .
CLARKE: Okay , if you say so . The Mask was a funny fucking movie . You know what other movie Cameron Diaz was great in ? 'There 's Something About Mary . '
GEORGE: It 's beautiful here at night .
LAURA: There 's no pollution here like in LA so you can actually see the stars .
IRA: They are beautiful , but we have to get going . We have a really long drive to get back to Los Angeles .
CLARKE: You ca n't leave now , you wo n't get ack until daylight . You should crash in the guest house . I 'm sure it not as fancy pants as where you live , George , but it 's better than driving all night or crashing at a hotel .
IRA: No , I 'm just big-boned .
GEORGE: We probably should get some rest efore the drive . All right , show us to our quarters , sir .
CLARKE: You sure you ca n't stay ?
IRA: We really do need to get back . I have to visit my mom . I ca n't miss it . It 's her birthday . Everyone in my family is coming in from across the country for it . She 's turning 65 . It 's very important we get back for it .
LAURA: That 's too bad , I wish you could stay .
CLARKE: I wish I could say I was gon na see you again , but I ca n't say that . His eyes start to mist up .
LAURA: Clarke , do n't . You do n't need to do that .
CLARKE: You know what ? I think I do need to do that . One thing I learned in China from some Buddhist friends of mine is it 's important to have an open heart , to live in the moment , and to speak the truth to each other . So I 'd like to say to you , George , that it was a great pleasure to meet someone who had such a big impact on my wife 's life . I really like you . And wish we had more time to get to know each other . And I wish you a peaceful end to your journey . And another great journey on the othe side of it . Clarke hugs George .
GEORGE: I really do n't know what to say . I e- ally do n't know what to say .
LAURA: That was beautiful , honey . Well let me walk them to the car . Ingrid walks over .
INGRID: Do n't be sad . Ira told us that his medicine is working and he 's not sick anymore .
MABLE: I think that was a secret . I do n't think you were supposed to say that .
CLARKE: Mable , take Ingrid into the house .
MABLE: Can we watch another SpongeBo movie ? Atlantis.Squarepantis ?
CLARKE: Yes . Go into the house and watch a movie now ! Mable and Ingrid walk back to the house .
LAURA: I never said that he was still sick . He just took some medicine and it 's looking better . You ca n't detect it in his blood , but it could come back .
CLARKE: Is it looking better ? Or is he etter ? Is he sick anymore ?
IRA: Well I do n't how you define these things-I 'm not sure .
CLARKE: is something going on here ? Are you getting your revenge on me while I 'm away ? I came clean with you , you ca n't come clean with me .
LAURA: You know what ? I do n't know what I want now .
IRA: Oh shit . It 's ON .
CLARKE: So this is what you want ? Was he ever sick in the first place ?
IRA: He was sick . He was very sick .
CLARKE: Because if this is what you want , I 'll leave right now . I 'm not going to play these games . I 'm happy to leave . I 'm not gonnna have you put me on the cross ecause I made some mistakes . You guys enjoy each other . I could give a fuck . If you need me , I 'll e at my apartment in China . Clarke leaves .
IRA: What the fuck is going on ? Did you guys do something ?
GEORGE: We had sex in Clarke 's office .
IRA: Why ?
GEORGE: Because I love her . She 's the best thing that 's ever happened to me .
IRA: But she has two kids , she 's married .
GEORGE: She 's miserable . He cheated on her .
IRA: You cheated on her .
GEORGE: Yeah , but that was a long time ago . I 've changed . You saw that douche ag . You do n't think he 's fucking geishas on every business trip ?
IRA: He was trying to cure you with herbs . He seems like a great guy .
GEORGE: This is none of your fucking usiness . Just stay out of it .
IRA: I ca n't stay out of it . We took your car here . I have no way of leaving .
GEORGE: This shit is deeper than you understand . People get divorced . People make mistakes and then they fix them . That 's how life works . It 's not a big deal . I know you 're still sad because your parents got divorced . Well get the fuck ove it . Call a fucking cab and go home .
IRA: So what are we gon na do ?
GEORGE: You 're gon na sleep in Clarke 's office . I 'm gon na go talk to Laura .
LAURA: I 've been going through all the ank statements , trying to figure out which are in his name and which are in mine .
GEORGE: Are you smoking a joint ?
LAURA: Yeah . My best friend Nancy grows this stuff on a hill by her house . You want some ?
GEORGE: No , that stuff makes me paranoid .
LAURA: Not me . It makes me feel sharper , Some people get tired , I get more energy , more clear .
GEORGE: What 's happening ?
LAURA: What 's happening ? Whatever we want to happen is gon na happen now . I 'm free . I 'm fucking free . Laura gets up , kisses him .
NERVOUSLY: Yeah , we 're free .
LAURA: A tank could roll through this place , it would n't wake them up . They kiss some more . She moans louder .
IRA: Hey , Daisy . It 's Ira .
EXHAUSTED: Jesus Christ , what time is it already ?
IRA: It 's 10 15 in the morning .
GEORGE: Oh my god . Really ? I mean , this is fun , but I do n't know how much I can take . Hopefully they 'll take a nap at some point . I want to take a nap .
IRA: They do n't look that tired .
MABLE: Look what I did . I want this hung up on the wall .
INGRID: Mama , I have to go to the bathroom . Come wipe my butt .
LAURA: I have to talk to them for a minute . Mable , go wipe you sister 's butt .
MABLE: She can do it . She 's almost six . That 's weird . Ingrid and Mable walk off together .
IRA: I wet the bed til I was eleven . It was n't even a mental thing . I just got relaxed when I was asleep .
LAURA: I spoke to Clarke . He 's going to fly back to China tonight . I was thinking about driving to the airport and meeting him there and telling him that when he comes ack , he should find another place to live .
GEORGE: That 's great . Are you okay doing that ?
LAURA: Yes . It 's what I want . I just need to figure out when we would move down to LA . It might be etter to let the kids finish out the school year because I have to apply to the private schools in LA , and I do n't know if I missed the deadline . Then I 'd have to look into the charter schools . Sometimes these private schools , if you give them a donation , they let your kids in . Maybe you can stay up here for part of the year if I ca n't make it happen .
GEORGE: Sure . If I 'm not shooting a movie , or on tour or something , that would e great .
MABLE: I made her wipe her own butt .
INGRID: I did it , but I do n't know if I did a good job . Look at what I drew . I drew a picture of you . Look ? Show Mama .
GEORGE: This is a small bookstore . They 've only got one Philip Roth book . Did n't he write like fifty books ?
IRA: So when are we going to go home ? You 're not talking at all about when we 're going to go home .
GEORGE: She 's going to talk to Clarke tonight , and then she 's going to make a plan . We 've got to get ove that hurdle .
IRA: Are you okay with everything ? This is happening pretty fast .
GEORGE: This is exactly what I wanted .
IRA: Okay .
GEORGE: I mean , she 's cool , right ?
IRA: She 's nice . I do n't really know her very well .
GEORGE: She was kind of cooler when I knew her back in the day . She 's still hot , but she was crazy hot back then . Her attitude has changed a it . With the kids and all . Back then she was really sexy , and all about fucking . I know she 's busy with her life now , but it is a little different .
IRA: Yeah , well when you have two kids and a husband , and horses and ducks , it 's not all about fucking .
GEORGE: Well hopefully everything will work out . If it does n't , it just was n't meant to be .
IRA: What does that mean ?
GEORGE: It means I 'm going to give it a shot . I 'm excited , but I 'm not going to really know if it works until we 're in it . I hope I 'm just not in love with the person she used to be .
IRA: She 's about to leave her husband for good . She has two kids . You 're not sure this is going to work ?
GEORGE: There 's no way to ever be sure that anything 's going to work ! I could n't live up here . She wants me to live up here . I do n't think I can do it . Maybe a couple of weeks a year .
IRA: Well , she 'll live with you .
GEORGE: Do you think she means that she 's going to bring the kids too ?
IRA: Of course . What else would she do ?
GEORGE: I do n't know , do n't some men get custody of the kids ? Or they split the custody ? I like the kids , but I 've never lived with kids before .
LAURA: I 'll be back in an hour and a half , tops . And then it all begins .
GEORGE: Okay , call me if you need any ackup .
LAURA: I love you .
GEORGE: I.. . love you . The car drives off .
IRA: You do n't want to hang with the kids ?
GEORGE: Nah , I was going to watch fou hockey games at once . I 've neve done that .
IRA: okay , but I 've got to run out and grab some cigarettes .
GEORGE: But you do n't smoke .
IRA: I never smoked in front of you ecause you were sick . But I do .
GEORGE: Do n't you know how to do it ?
INGRID: I do n't do it good .
RELUCTANTLY: Okay .
IRA: How do you get to the fucking airport ? !
GEORGE: Where are you , where are you ? You have to come back here . I need your help . I do n't know how to do this .
MABLE: I think my mom and dad are getting a divorce . I do n't want my parents to get divorced . All my friends ' parents are divorced , and they 're not happy .
GEORGE: Why would you say that ?
MABLE: I heard my mom talking to he friend . I listened through the wall . She was looking for a lawyer . He cheated on her . What does cheating mean ? That he 's going to marry someone else ? Why do n't they just try harder ?
GEORGE: Laura , it 's George . Come back to the house . Maybe you should n't do it . Maybe it 's too early for this . Call the house .
IRA: I 'm getting cigarettes .
CLARKS: I 'm so sorry . This only happened ecause of me . It 's all my fault . I made you feel terrible . I made you feel unsafe in ou elationship . I 'm so sorry . Please forgive me . Ira stands there , staring at them .
LAURA: I 'm sorry too . I love you so much . It was just a flirtation . It neve went anywhere . It 's just after you cheated on me , I felt so alone . And you were gone so often that I felt like our life does n't work .
CLARKE: Then I have to make a change . I 'll stop most of the traveling . There 's nothing more important than you and the kids .
IRA: Oh , I 'm just headed back to Los Angeles . I 've got some spots at the Improv I 've got to do this weekend .
LAURA: Oh , fuck .
CLARKE: You 're headed back to Los Angeles ? Then why are you at the International terminal ?
IRA: This is the International terminal ? I 'm so confused , I 've never been to this airport before .
CLARKE: Yeah , this is the Air China First Class Lounge .
LAURA: I do n't know what to say .
CLARKE: Tel- me the truth ! Just tell me the tri.t_h . ; _
LAURA: I came here to tell you that I wanted you to move out when you came home . But I realized this was a mistake , so I did n't say it . Please do n't hold that against me . We 've worked everything out . Everything is fine .
CLARKE: Who 's watching the kids ? Who 's watching the fucking kids ?
IRA: An adult is watching them .
CLARKE: Is George watching our fucking kids ? I will kill him . Clarke runs off .
IRA: What the hell happened ?
LAURA: Who the fuck are you ? Get the fuck out of my life ! You and George have to get the fuck out of my life . You are ruining everything !
IRA: Uh oh .
CLARKE: ( angry-to Mable and
INGRID: Can you take it into the family fun oom ?
MABLE: Are you two going to fight ?
CLARKE: Ye s .
GEORGE: She 's not happy .
CLARKE: No one who 's married is fucking happy . Leave us alone ! You fucked up . You fucked it up with her a long time ago . Let it go or I will kill you . I will literally kill you till you 're fucking dead . That disease did n't kill you . But I will kill you .
GEORGE: You should n't joke about my disease . That was very serious . Very scary .
IRA: Okay .
GEORGE: You said you were getting cigarettes then you ran to the airport to stop her . What kind of friend are you ?
IRA: I am a good friend because this entire situation is crazy . You are out of control .
GEORGE: I did n't deserve what you did to me . You betrayed me !
IRA: When I got there , she was already kissing him . I never even had a chance to stop it . I did n't get to do anything !
CLARKE: Do n't pretend you 're fucking mad at each other , just to distract me so I wo n't beat your ass . Clarke pushes George .
GEORGE: Do n't hit me ! I 've been sick ! They do n't know . The medicine is working now , but I 'm still sick . Clarke punches George .
IRA: You told me not to jump in .
GEORGE: That 's what `` do n't jump in '' means . It means `` jump in . '' Help me !
IRA: I know , that 's why I became a comedian , because everyone used to eat me up !
GEORGE: Laura , tell Clarke to stop !
LAURA: Clarke , please do n't do this .
CLARKE: Do n't tell me what I can and can not do .
GEORGE: Laura , tell him . Tell him you want to be with me now . Laura does n't answer .
LAURA: Why did you have to come here and confuse me ? Everything was fine efore you came here . Now everything is all screwed up .
GEORGE: Laura , what 's it going to be ? Are you going with him , or are you going with me ? Laura looks at Clarke .
LAURA: With him .
GEORGE: Do n't do this .
LAURA: You fucked up my life . And now I fucked up yours . But just a little . Probably just for a day . She walks back into the house .
CLARKE: Hit the road before I put you through another round .
GEORGE: You cheated on her too !
CLARKE: Yeah , but we 're married . We 're going to work through this shit . You should have waited until you were married to cheat . It buys you another chance .
GEORGE: She told me I was the love of he life . And she loves me more than she loves you !
CLARKE: When she said that , did she think you were dying ?
GEORGE: Yeah !
CLARKE: Too bad you had to 'Live and find out it was n't true . Leave my fucking family alone !
GEORGE: Stop Ira , you 're hitting me too . Mable and Ingrid appear outside .
MABLE: What are you guys doing ?
INGRID: What 's happening ?
IRA: We 're just playing that 's all .
GEORGE: We 're wrestling . It 's fun .
CLARKS: Boys like to wrestle just like girls .
INGRID: Are you bleeding ?
GEORGE: No . We were just painting . I got some paint on my cheek .
CLARKE: Come on girls . Let 's go inside .
IRA: That was meaner than him punching you . That is a demented motherfucker .
GEORGE: None of you fuckers can hurt me .
IRA: Get the hell off of me you psycho .
GEORGE: Drive me home .
IRA: No .
GEORGE: How are you gon na get home then ?
IRA: Fine .
GEORGE: Oh yeah ?
IRA: No matter what the situation , no matter how many laughs or how many women you get you will never be happy . You 're always going to be miserable . You are a bottomless pit . A bottomless wound .
GEORGE: What about you ? You are just a lackey . Who are you to judge me ? You tried to screw me over , afte all I. have done for you .
IRA: I am not responsible for you . You wanted me to sit back and destroy this woman 's life ? Help you cheat on her ? You put me in a terrible position . I do n't give a fuck , go fuck yourself .
GEORGE: Lacky .
IRA: You made me the tacky ? I 'm not a lacky , it 's a job .
GEORGE: It 's not a job , you 're a tacky . You 're not even that fucking funny . This gets Ira very mad .
IRA: Who cares ? If being funny means eing like you , I rather be a little less funny .
GEORGE: Mission accomplished .
IRA: You 're the only person I know who learned nothing from a near-death experience ! You actually went ackwards . All it did was it ought out what a prick you are , ought everything bad to the surface . I liked you better when I was sure you were gon na die .
GEORGE: I 'm not going anywhere !
IRA: Everything is about you . You do n't even know where I live . You 've never asked me one question about my life . How much can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about anything !
GEORGE: Who are you to fucking judge anyone ? You 're not my friend , you just want my money . You just want to get your foot in the door .
IRA: Fuck your money . Fuck you . This has all been a huge mistake .
GEORGE: Wake me when we get home .
IRA: okay , I 'm getting out . You have to drive yourself home . I 'm getting out here .
GEORGE: Why did n't you drive me to my house ?
IRA: Because then I 'd still have you car .

IRA: There is no later ! I 'm not going to ever talk to you again . So I do n't want your car .

FEMALE CUSTOMER: Is the potato salad fresh ?
IRA: I made it myself this morning .
FEMALE CUSTOMER: Is it good ?
IRA: I stake my reputation on it .
FEMALE CUSTOMER: Okay . Give me a quart .
IRA: Mrs. Gail , this fine woman would like a quarf'of potato salad .
GEORGE: Do you have any turkey that 's hormone-free ?
IRA: Yes we do .
GEORGE: So this is where you work .
IRA: Back in the saddle .
GEORGE: I thought we were writing a screenplay .
IRA: Well , you 're not a very good writing partner .
GEORGE: Or any kind of partner . You want to make me a turkey sandwich and talk to me ? They give you breaks around here ?
IRA: That guy was a douche-bag .
GEORGE: But also kind of cool . It 's a very weird combination .
IRA: He was going to heal you with those herbs , man . You get sick again , you should call that guy .
GEORGE: I think most of what you said to me was true . And I really am sorry . I think I 'm still not very healthyin my brain .
IRA: It 's all right , man . You 've been through a lot .
GEORGE: Well , I appreciate you trying to help me . Even though it was kind of an impossible task .
IRA: Is everything going okay ? How are you doing ?
GEORGE: I am not doing well , but things have certainly been worse . So , I will be fine .
THEN: You were good the other night . I hear you 're getting regular spots now .
IRA: I 'm actually going up tonight .
GEORGE: Really ? Any new jokes you 're working on ?
IRA: Yeah , I 've been trying to get off my ass and do some writing .
GEORGE: What do you got ?
IRA: I was thinking about doing a bit about how I 'm not very good looking , but I 'm not bad looking , ut I 'm just good-looking enough that if I had a good personality , it might put me over the top .
GEORGE: You should do something about how , when you date a girl , and you feel eally good and she likes you , and then you see pictures of all her ex- oyfriends , and they 're all really goofy-looking guys , and it 's not that you 're good looking , it 's just that in this psychotic girl 's eyes , you 're good looking ?
IRA: And how all of her boyfriends look like Lou Costello .
GEORGE: Why do n't you say Dom Deluise ? it 's a more current reference .
IRA: More current ? What year was Cannonball Run , 1978 ?
GEORGE: Okay , okay . What else you got ?
IRA: I was going to talk about how I have n't had sex in so long , that I ca n't even remember my previous sexual experiences so I can masturbate to them .
GEORGE: You should say , now when I masturbate , I have to think about the last time I masturbated .
IRA: That 's a good one . You can write .
GEORGE: You know , I always wanted to be part of the comedy field .
