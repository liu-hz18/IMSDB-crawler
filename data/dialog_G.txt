HAYES: last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service , particularly in the land-based maritime specialties . What 's more , the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on
DEHAVEN: Whoa , whoa , whoa . `` Land-based maritime specialties . '' Gim me a second here to de-euphemize that
HAYES: Hardly the case , Senator .
DEHAVEN: Well , I 'm just an old dame without much time left , so you 'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type . I am deeply concerned over the Navy 's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military . Case in point
HAYES: Madam Senator this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy . I must seriously question whether
DEHAVEN: The Navy 's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier . Female aviator , it just so happens . You 're familiar with this report and its conclusion , am I right ?
HAYES: I was one member of the investigating commission .
DEHAVEN: Yes , I see your signature right here twice the size of everyone else 's . And your conclusion was `` pilot error , '' hmm ?
HAYES: I 'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of
DEHAVEN: I 'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared fo anything , Mr. Hayes .
HAYES: The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier .
DEHAVEN: That aside for the moment , I 'm struck by the tenor , the ill-spirit of your report the degrading emarks by other aviators innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations even a eference to her sexual activity the weekend prior . In my seven years on this committee , I 've never seen a downed aviato treated like this . Never . I 'm deeply disturbed by this report , Mr. Hayes . Not just what it bodes fo women in the military but fo your own confirmation as well .
PRESS #1: What about those who say women are n't suited for all jobs ? That they 're physically weaker they have less stamina
DEHAVEN: Sure . And we 're gon na hog the athroom , too . DEHAVEN 'S AIDE catches up , pulls her aside .
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: White House boys want a private meeting .
DEHAVEN: I 'll act surprised .
HAYES: Well ?
JORDAN: Lieutenant O'Neil .
ROYCE: All right , stand by , we 're going to switch over to COMSAT
TACTICAL OFFICER: Voice-system now secure
ROYCE: Okay , fresh stuff Lost a NATO plane over the Sea of Japan . ELB signals leads us to believe the pilot is alive and has made his way to the North Korean shore , near a fishing village , `` Tamyung . ''
JORDAN: North Korean beaches are the best protected , most heavily monitored in the world . The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system . Extraction team has to be small and silent I 'd go with Seals over Delta Force . Problem is , do n't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore fo target practice . Where 's The Polk ?
ROYCE: Halfway 'round the world . So that 's the problem we can get the team in , just not out .
JORDAN: Unless you Whiskey Run .
ROYCE: Blank faces here , O'Neil .
JORDAN: Quick-hit technique used by Capone . Rigged a getaway car with running oards and handles . All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ide . Check the files DPRK-57 I doped it out as a contingency plan Seal Team infiltrates , picks up the package , links up with ecovery sub . But do n't waste time opening and closing hatches . They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters . A dubious beat .
ROYCE: You expect the extraction team to ide the sub bare-back ? Is that correct , O'Neil ?
JORDAN: Only four minutes to neutral waters , sir . Why not ?
ROYCE: All right , sending the ecommendation across the river . Royce out . The phone goes dead .
JORDAN: No , thank you , sir .
ROYCE: That was good headwork , lieutenant .
JORDAN: Thank you , sir . We hear back from the Pentagon ?
ROYCE: Probably hear back from CNN first .
JORDAN: Hate this part . Just sweating it out on the sidelines .
ROYCE: Intel has its own glory , lieutenant no matter how subtle . Now they reach
JORDAN: Is this my glory , sir ?
N.I.C. SECRETARY: Excuse me , but I have Senato DeHaven on the line for you .
ROYCE: Jesus God , what now ? He bounds up the stairs toward his office .
N.I.C. SECRETARY: I 'm sorry , sir no she asked to speak with Lieutenant O'Neil .
DEHAVEN: So everyone I talk to says you 're top drawer with silk stockings inside .
JORDAN: `` Coronado . ''
DEHAVEN: California .
JORDAN: I know that , sir . Ma'am . It 's just that Beggin ' your pardon , Senator , but do you understand that this involves combat training ?
DEHAVEN: This is just a test case , O'Neil . But if it works out if you work out it could well change the Navy 's official policy on women in combat . Or , actually , its official non-policy . Now who 's you immediate superior there ?
JORDAN: Captain Dwyer . Technically .
DEHAVEN: My office will fill him in and help expedite . Look forward to meeting you at the proper time . Jumping off now
JORDAN: Uh , question , ma'am .
DEHAVEN: Yes , dear .
JORDAN: Would I be the only one ? The only woman ?
DEHAVEN: There 'll be more to follow but yes , dear , right now you 're the pick of a very large litter . And you success would mean a lot . Jumping , now
JORDAN: Well , shit-a-doodle-do
ROYCE: So why 're you even considering it ? Are you ?
JORDAN: Just like you would be .
ROYCE: Spec-Recon . Those guys are world- class warriors . And they will not want you there , Jordan .
JORDAN: I take it you do n't either . Feet . Dutifully , Royce massages her feet .
ROYCE: Well , you 're doin ' shit-hot at Intel .
JORDAN: Royce . We 're the same age , we started the same time and now you 're sitting in the upperdecks while I 'm still down in the bullpen . What does that tell you about the Navy ?
ROYCE: She 's haze grey and underway
JORDAN: You need operational duty to really advance you need combat training to go operational yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits . I 'm topped out at Intel . Forget the glass ceiling I 'm eating my head on a big brass ceiling .
ROYCE: So dump on me .
JORDAN: This has nothing to do with you .
ROYCE: Well , guess I do n't even need to be here
JORDAN: Get your dick back here . It has everything to do with you .
ROYCE: You 're such a ball-breake sometimes . Especially at night .
JORDAN: Sorry . But after our days So if I try this thing if I ship out to Coronado what happens here ?
ROYCE: I 'll try to keep the door open . If you wash out , I make it so that
JORDAN: Wai ' , wait . What happens if it works ? Four months of training , three years of operational duty . What then ?
ROYCE: I do n't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life , Jordan . Maybe we should just let it happen .
JORDAN: Which is guy-speak for
ROYCE: Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth . But I 'm trying to be honest , okay ? Three years is a long time . Do n't ask me to predict how I 'll feel then , Jordan , because I do n't know . And either do you .
JORDAN: You know , right up until you said that I thought I did know . Wounded , she gets out .
ROYCE: Jordan
JORDAN: Thank you , Royce . It was shaping up like such a tough call and then you go and make it so goddamn easy . Really , thank you so much .
DUTY OFFICER: So you 're the one .
JORDAN: Still do n't have my bearings yet . Direct me to the officer 's quarters ?
DUTY OFFICER: You 'll proceed directly to the infirmary for eye tests , blood tests , urinalysis , pregnancy test . Uniform issue adjacent . Then you 're to report to the Base Commander . He 'd like a word with you .
JORDAN: Fine . And the officer 's quarters ?
DUTY OFFICER: C.O . 's office can supply you with directions . Enjoy your visit , lieutenant .
BLONDELL: B.O.Q. , south side . Take a starboard tack out the door .
JORDAN: Thank you , ensign .
BLONDELL: No problem , lieutenant .
YEOMAN: Lieutenant j.g . O'Neil reporting , sir .
JORDAN: Thank you , sir .
MILLER: What am I scannin ' here ? Other eyes quickly lock in on
THE CHIEF: The sun and moon the ebb and flow of the Pacific tides global warming the very angle of the Earth upon its axis these are just some of the things I control in my world . Trainees swap private looks .
MCCOOL: We 're fucked .
SLUTNIK: Darth Vader reads poetry
MCCOOL: We are so fucked .
INSTRUCTOR: Count down one , two count down three , four
CLASS CADENCE: One , two , three , four One , two , three , four
THE CHIEF: You may think that you are the ightest , the best , the strongest . I assure you , that is a total delusion on your part . It is my jo to show you just how weak human eings can truly be . 60 percent of you will not finish this course . How do I know ? Because that is an historical fact . It 's also intimidating shit .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Down to BVDs !
STAMM: What is it with the damn phone poles ? We sign up for Spec-Recon o
WICKWIRE: Just trying to thin the herd . That 's all they want to do right now .
SLUTNIK: Man . Does n't she know it 's rude to point ?
NEWBERRY: Wow . You see that girl ?
WICKWIRE: I got eyes , Newberry .
SLUTNIK: One night . Just one night in my oom , she 'd forget all about playin ' commando .
ENGLAND: Tone that shit down , Slutnik . You heard with they said .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Out of the water ! The class breaks for the beach .
THE CHIEF: Now make like sugar cookies and roll in the sand for me .
ENGLAND: How bad ? Stamm ?
JORDAN: We better get a medic over
STAMM: No , goddamnit . No .
INSTRUCTOR: Up ! Up ! Up ! Up !
THE CHIEF: Pain is your friend . You ally . It will keep you awake in times of emergency it will tell you when you are seriously injured it will keep you angry and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home . But you know the best thing about pain ?
CLASS: No , sir !
THE CHIEF: It lets you know that you are n't dead yet .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Go regulation if you ca n't do the everses , O'Neil .
JORDAN: Thank you , sir . But I like these just fine .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Not doin ' them very fine , O'Neil .
JORDAN: I 'll try anyway , sir .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: You 'll try what we tell you to try , O'Neil . Go regulation .
THE CHIEF: Who 's it gon na be . I just wonder , who is it gon na be
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: On your belly on your back on your feet on your belly on your back on your feet
THE CHIEF: You have noticed a ship 's bell hanging at the west side of this courtyard . If , at any time , you feel you can not continue with you training that bell is you salvation . Strike it three times , and the ordeal is over . Nervous eyes flick to the bell .
SLUTNIK: I 'm thinkin ' we could jump him right now
THE CHIEF: `` Can I really take 15 weeks of this ubonic asshole ? '' If you do n't know the answer to that question , the answer is `` No , you can not . '' And that is another historical fact . So do it . Admit you do n't have what it takes admit you are out of you depth or we 're all heading back to the beach right now . Instructors ! Time hack !
WICKWIRE: Cuh-lass , face right ! They march off .
ENGLAND: Better look elsewhere , O'Neil .
SLUTNIK: Half a night , Lord , just gim me half a night to set her straight
MILLER: Average woman is 25 percent body fat . That 's one-quarter fat , man . Think about that .
MCCOOL: Nice distribution , though .
MILLER: No way does she makes this program . No way .
VOICE: It 's not so much that they hate you
WICKWIRE: They 're more afraid of you .
JORDAN: Well , now I feel so much better .
WICKWIRE: It was made clear before you came harassment equals career suicide . Ca n't say anything good , so they do n't say much at all . To you face , anyway .
JORDAN: Whose orders were those ?
WICKWIRE: It was made clear . Anyway , stay ballsy . First week 's hell , then it levels out . Until S.E.R.E . training , anyway . That 's hell-and-a-half .
JORDAN: And how do you know that ?
WICKWIRE: Made it to Week 10 last time .
JORDAN: I did n't know they let you try again . Especially at your age .
WICKWIRE: You 're kind of a surprise yourself .
THE CHIEF: England , 88 seconds . You 're good to go for the slide-for-life . Wickwire , roll back till you get south of 90 .
WICKWIRE: Fuck . Yes sir .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Who 'd you kiss to get back in here , anyway ? Wickwire dusts off and starts back for
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: Hang on , here
CORTEZ: Aw , what is this
JORDAN: Sir
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: Do n't have to use it , O'Neil , but it 's got ta go out . Five four three
JORDAN: I can make this wall without
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: two one MARK !
CLASS: Lesgo , Cortez , LESGO , GO , GO !
CORTEZ: Shit of a saint
CLASS: Take her , take her here , Cortez lookit that monkey-man go hoo- yah , hoo-yah
THE CHIEF: Cortez , 93 seconds . O'Neil , 94 . Cortez , do a little rescue-recovery on your gonads and line up again . O'Neil move ahead .
JORDAN: Say again , sir ?
THE CHIEF: You heard me . Move on .
CORTEZ: Aw , this is such bullshit
JORDAN: Chief , sir , I do n't understand why
THE CHIEF: Educate her , Pyro .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Automatic five-second deduction , which slips you under the wire . It 's called `` gender-norming , '' O'Neil standard procedure for all females in physical training courses . Where you been the last few years ?
JORDAN: What `` all females '' ? If I 'm the only
THE CHIEF: Twice now , I have said the words `` move on . ''
SLUTNIK: Ca n't live with them , ca n't kill them . What 's the point ?
MCCOOL: Somebody throw a tent over this circus .
WICKWIRE: Just let it go . If it 's in you favor , just shut the hell up and take it .
JORDAN: Pardon the hour , sir . But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way .
BLONDELL: This some kind of joke ?
SLUTNIK: Well , who the shit you think you are ? Comin ' in here like that ?
JORDAN: Your new roommate .
SLUTNIK: Hey , hey , HEY . No possibility . You ca n't stay in here . You ca n't sleep ight next to me .
JORDAN: Funny , the C.O . says I can .
SLUTNIK: Aw , lookit this , lookit this she 's bringin ' Tampax in here . C'mon , you got nothin ' but rooms over there .
JORDAN: That your desk ? I 'll take this one .
SLUTNIK: WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE ?
JORDAN: Listen , Sex Ape . I 'm here to stay . And if you do n't want me for a oommate or classmate , you got two options move out or ring out . End of file .
MCCOOL: `` It 's not a job it 's an adventure . ''
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: 58 degrees this morning ! That 's not a bad water temp , really if you 're standing where we are !
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: Slurred speech , lack of proper moto control , short-term amnesia all early signs of hypothermia ! Advanced hypothermia is easy to detect in a classmate ! He 'll look like he 's dead !
THE CHIEF: Body heat . In situations of extreme cold , you can always count on body heat to keep you alive and I do not mean your own . We will break you of the cultural barriers that dictate you should not invade another man 's space . Are any of you in a situation of extreme cold right now ? INTERCUTTING trainees and instructors
CLASS: Yes , sir !
THE CHIEF: Then why are n't you all over the man next to you ?
JORDAN: Just do it , okay ?
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: If you ca n't feel the other guy 's pecker , you ai n't in tight enough ! I want nuts to butts !
JORDAN: Come on , Montgomery
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: Flea ! O'Neil ! Why is there a break in that line ?
JORDAN: Montgomery , why do they call you `` Flea '' ?
FLEA: It 's really `` F. Lee Montgomery '' ut that gets whittled down to just `` Flea . '' For short , ma'am .
JORDAN: So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size ?
FLEA: No , ma'am .
JORDAN: Well , Flea , I appreciate the respect you just showed me . But I do n't need it and do n't want it not that kind of respect , anyway . It 's just gon na hurt us both , okay ?
FLEA: I 'll work on it , ma'am .
JORDAN: Do that .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Time .
THE CHIEF: Check your watch , Pyro . Seems fast .
JORDAN: Hey . You okay , Flea ?
FLEA: 'Snot me . It 's him .
MILLER: Jesus , my hands they are n't workin ' right
NEWBERRY: How long i'zis for ?
WICKWIRE: 'Sposed to be 20-minute intervals , no more .
NEWBERRY: Swear each time 's gettin ' longer .
MCCOOL: This where you bailed last time , Wick ?
WICKWIRE: Huh-uh but was n't middla February last time , either .
FLEA: How you doin ' , Miller ? Miller ? No answer . Bad sign . On shore
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: 22 minutes Ignoring , the Chief lifts his bullhorn
THE CHIEF: Remember , all this is completely voluntary . For any of you who do n't want to continue , Instructor Johns is now serving coffee and danish at the ambulance .
SLUTNIK: He 's the fuckin ' Antichrist .
MCCOOL: Wick ! They really got donuts ove there ? Or just some ' a last night 's dinner rolls ?
FLEA: Look like donuts to me
JORDAN: What 're you guys doing ? Huh ?
MCCOOL: Just askin '
JORDAN: What , you gon na give it all up for a maple twist ? How dumb you got ta be ? That 's exactly what they
CLASS: NO !
MEDICS: Tell me what day this is look at me now what city are you from , sailor here , look right here
THE CHIEF: You want another minute to think about this ? Huh ? Do any of you want to reconsider ? Avoiding his eyes , Miller wags his head .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: By my watch which , of course appears to be broken they 've been in 27 minutes without the benefit of protective gear .
THE CHIEF: Everybody out .
WICKWIRE: Hey . Way to gut it out .
JORDAN: Thanks , Wick .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Miller . Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium . Really did n't expect to lose him .
THE CHIEF: Every class has its surprises , Pyro . This one 'll be no different .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Change those clothes , be back here in six minutes ! And I am timing you !
SLUTNIK: Jesus Christ . And I only got three minutes apiece
ENGLAND: Barkin ' up the wrong dress , Slutnik . You ai n't their type .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: O'Neil ! What 're you gawking at ?
P.R. FLAK: `` last week at Coronado . The woman , identity unknown , is believed to be the first female candidate fo the elite Special Reconnaissance program . Her presence could signal a shift in the Navy 's long-standing policy that excludes women from combat positions . ''
YEOMAN: Inbound now , sir . Had to pull he out of the dive bell .
P.R. FLAK: I have interview requests from two local TV stations . And a sociologist from U.C . San Diego called , wanted to know if she could examine the interaction between `` G.I . Jane '' and the men .
YEOMAN: Senator DeHaven calling , sir . The C.O . gets an instant headache .
DEHAVEN: Commander , are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin ' their fill ? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases
JORDAN: See me , sir ?
DEHAVEN: Well , seein 's how this thing is out , you let me handle the r.p.m . From this point forward , I want all press matters coordinated via my office . I 'll be god-damned if I 'm gon na watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one . Him or the President . This my shade ? `` Midnight Mahogany '' ? 'Cuz I 'm comin ' dangerously close to lookin ' like Ronald Reagan here .
JORDAN: Ca n't complain , ma'am .
DEHAVEN: Hmmm . Maybe I 'll ask when I see you in person .
JORDAN: Uh , ma'am .
DEHAVEN: Gon na be visiting that all-woman 's America 's cup team in a few weeks If I were a gambler , I 'd say Dennis O'Conner 's days are numbered . But they 're in San Diego , so I thought I 'd take a quick promenade of the ase .
JORDAN: Sir , I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this . Not this article , not
YEOMAN: Sir ? Secretary Hayes calling . The C.O . 's headache becomes a migraine .
JORDAN: Permission to leave , sir ?
DEHAVEN: Think I overplayed it ?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing . They 'll never know whose leak it is .
THE CHIEF: Boat Five Wickwire , Cozad , Vinyl , Intagliata , Ayers , and Wise . Lieutenant Wickwire is your senio officer . Follow his orders to you death .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Get it up !
THE CHIEF: Boat Six England , O'Neil , McCool , Montgomery , Cortez , and Slutnik . Lieutenant England is your senio officer .
JORDAN: Ah , c'mon
CORTEZ: Motherachrist
SLUTNIK: Me ? Again ?
THE CHIEF: Somebody got a problem with the muster ?
JORDAN: Fine by me , sir !
CORTEZ: No problem , sir !
SLUTNIK: Full of joy here , sir !
THE CHIEF: Boat Seven
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: First crew to finish gets hot food and warm racks for the night ! Rest of you are digging hide-sites and eating earthworms tonight !
ENGLAND: So shutup and stroke , McCool !
SLUTNIK: Hoo-yah ! Hoo-yah !
THE CHIEF: Your boat just hit razor coral . What do you do now ?
ENGLAND: Patch and pump ! C'mon ! Whose ass is on the kit ?
MCCOOL: I say keep paddlin ' ! We 're almost
ENGLAND: Forget it , McCool ! Pri One is to save the boat , not win a race ! So let 's get on it !
CORTEZ: Four years I petition to get into this program . Four years . Finally get here , and now it 's co-ed ? Such ullshit . Now I 'm gettin ' hammered just 'cuz she 's on our crew .
SLUTNIK: Least you do n't have to sleep with her every goddamn night .
CORTEZ: Tellin ' you , I 'd rather be the last class with balls than the first one with chicks .
MCCOOL: Had a grandaddy who wanted to be a Navy man . Wanted to fire them big guns on a big-ass battleship . But Navy said to him , `` Oh , no . You can only do one thing on a battleship . '' `` Well what 's that ? '' grandaddy said . `` Cook , '' they said . Now this ai n't 100 years ago I 'm talkin ' United States Navy , middla World War II . And you know the reason they gave him ? You know why they tol ' my grandaddy he could n't fight for his country ?
ENGLAND: He talked too much ?
MCCOOL: `` Negroes ca n't see at night . Bad night vision . ''
JORDAN: You 're kiddin ' me .
MCCOOL: See , you just the new nigger on the lock , O'Neil . That 's all . And maybe you moved in too early .
ROYCE: Goddamn . My poster girl .
HAYES: Did n't you hear ? Effective immediately , all navy vessels can no longer be referred to as `` she . '' BRAYS of laughter .
VOICE #1: women are child-bearers . Life- givers . Now we 're going to make them killers ?
VOICE #2: just do n't have the upper-body strength
VOICE #3: How strong do you need to be to launch a rocket ? To push a button or pull a trigger ? Royce ca n't get away from it .
ROYCE: Not right now .
CIRCLE #1: but men have trained as athletes for 5,000 years . Women have been at it for , what , couple of decades ? Do we really know the limits of thei strength ?
CIRCLE #2: Or their endurance ? You know , 30 years ago , women marathoners were 90 minutes off the pace of the men . Now , the women 's time is probably only 20 minutes off .
CIRCLE #1: Try 15 .
CIRCLE #3: But what do female soldiers really contribute ? I mean , why is this `` G.I . Jane '' there instead of a man ?
ROYCE: You wait right here . I 'll get the drinks .
VOICE #1: Take my word for it . It 's just not going to happen . Not now , not anytime soon .
VOICE #2: You 're guaranteeing that ?
VOICE #1: I have it on unorthodox but reliable authority that combat positions will emain off-limits . Despite what 's happening with our Babe in Boyland .
ROYCE: Lieutenant !
THE CHIEF: Crew Six ! Stand by !
ENGLAND: Flea ! 'Cool ! O'Neil ! Cortez ! Slutnik ! In that order ! Five- second intervals ! Let 's go !
CORTEZ: Hoo-yah ! Better ' n sex in a ca crash ! But now they 're bearing down fast on
THE CHIEF: Next recovery ! Keep goin ' , keep goin ' !
JORDAN: Permission to get dressed , sir ?
THE CHIEF: It seems the men could n't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs . Israeli men would linge over wounded females often to the detriment of the mission , often endangering their own lives . They do n't use women anymore .
JORDAN: Sir , someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross . May I ask what you got it for ?
THE CHIEF: For pulling a 210-pound man out of a urning barrack in Saudi Arabia .
JORDAN: I see . So when a man tries to escue another man , he 's a hero . But when he tries to rescue a woman , he 's gone soft .
THE CHIEF: Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear , lieutenant ? She ca n't say yes . She wants to but ca n't .
JORDAN: It also seems like a problem with the men 's attitude , sir . So maybe you should be sniffing around thei shower room instead .
THE CHIEF: England went out with a stress fracture . That puts you in charge , lieutenant .
JORDAN: McCool 's that same rank . We 're both j.g . 's .
THE CHIEF: You were commissioned one month earlier , which makes you the senio officer . Remember . There are no bad crews only bad leaders .
CORTEZ: No operational experience , and now she 's callin ' the shots ? Unbelievable .
SLUTNIK: Suppose she 'll wan na eat with us now
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: O'Neil O'Neil O'NEIL ! Finally she stops .
BLONDELL: They take you away to San Clemente Island . Half the guys quit when they come back . Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half .
JORDAN: That 's what I hear .
BLONDELL: Can I ask you somethin ' , lieutenant ? How come you 're doing this ? I mean , we 're kinda curious .
JORDAN: Who 's `` we '' ?
BLONDELL: Just some of the women .
JORDAN: I do n't know if there 's any single eason . But my father was Navy . And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den . It showed a girl trying on a sailor 's uniform while saying , `` Gee , I wish I were a man ! I 'd join the Navy ! '' Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it , and even then it felt wrong . Made me mad . And I do n't think a month has gone by that I have n't thought about that poster . `` Gee , I wish I were a man . ''
BLONDELL: I 've been accused of that wish .
JORDAN: The woman I saw you with
BLONDELL: Just a friend . We have friends , too , you know .
JORDAN: But are there I mean , how many
BLONDELL: More than you 'd guess . It 's just that we do n't hold coffee klatches . If more then three of us get together at any one time , the guys think it 's some kind of uprising . They laugh .
JORDAN: Royce
ROYCE: I 've been trying you for five days . Do n't they give you messages ?
JORDAN: I feel like there 's men here , there 's women here then there 's men . But hey , what 'd I expect ? INTERCUTTING Jordan and Royce
ROYCE: Well , not this . I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago . Got some fresh stuff about you . You may be in a hostile camp . I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn .
JORDAN: Me ? Why me ?
ROYCE: Do n't you know ? How they 're talking about you ?
JORDAN: I saw an article
ROYCE: I ca n't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about `` G.I . Jane . '' You 're all over the place , and whether you wanted it o not , the feminists are sizing you up for that poster . Jordan 's face sours with an errant thought .
JORDAN: So why are you telling me this ?
ROYCE: Big symbols make big targets , Jordan . I think someone 's gunning for you .
JORDAN: You know , Royce , I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets , too .
ROYCE: I 'm only trying to warn you in case
JORDAN: Well , let me warm you I 'm going though with this . The more everybody fucks with me , fucks with my head , the more it just makes me want to finish . So do n't expect me ack crying in your arms any time soon , okay ?
ROYCE: That 's not what I want , Jordan . I mean it is and it is n't
JORDAN: Still ca n't make up your mind , huh ? Got ta go , Royce .
ROYCE: Jordan . You watch your ass .
JORDAN: Sure . I 'll join the crowd .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Infiltrate establish your hide- site record any movement of troops , vehicles , patrols any activity inside your scan . If you are compromised , you have two options ! Newberry !
NEWBERRY: Evasive maneuvers or radio fo emergency extraction , sir !
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: If you are extracting , be damn sure to follow procedures you have learned in your classroom training ! A helo can not extract you from a wooded area ! You must bring it down in a clearing ! What 's the minimum clearance for an MH-60 Black Hawk , McCool ?
MCCOOL: 32 feet , six inches , sir !
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: You will be penalized for early extraction , but you will be penalized more for capture trust me , far more ! Survival ! Evasion ! Rescue ! Evacuation ! Welcome to
SLUTNIK: Feel right at home , McCool ?
JORDAN: South-southeast . And I do n't want to hear another word till we 're underground .
MCCOOL: Got two FAVs moving south . I make four banditos aboard , carrying H-60 machine guns
JORDAN: Newberry , get a photo . South ?
CORTEZ: Entering my scan now
JORDAN: West ?
SLUTNIK: Clear .
JORDAN: North ?
FLEA: Clear .
CORTEZ: FAVs clear .
MCCOOL: You mind ? I 'm trying to eat here .
SLUTNIK: So am I .
CORTEZ: Anyone ?
FLEA: Do n't wan na evacuate 'cuz someone came down with uric poisoning , el- tee .
JORDAN: Did n't even bitch about the seat , did I ?
MCCOOL: What the Got an unknown here . 100 yards north-northeast .
JORDAN: I do n't know
SLUTNIK: `` She ? '' There 's another one ? McCool takes a second look .
MCCOOL: Shit . Think we 're had .
CORTEZ: Smoke her .
MCCOOL: I ai n't gon na shoot her .
CORTEZ: Only blanks . Lem me do it .
MCCOOL: Hey . Ai n't your call , man . He looks to Jordan .
JORDAN: Pri One is to protect the mission . If she represents a real threat , we have to do it .
MCCOOL: Mighta been civilian .
NEWBERRY: They got regular peeps on this island , do n't they ?
CORTEZ: Banditos on the east perimeter ! 150 yards ! Shit , she was part of it !
MCCOOL: Fuck me .
FLEA: What 's the word , el-tee ? We 're about one minute from a major take- down here .
JORDAN: All right , fire-and-evade maneuvers . Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio we 're gon na be high speed , low drag all the way to the link-up site . Ready ?
SLUTNIK: Sure . Now she wants to shoot .
JORDAN: MOVE !
SLUTNIK: This ai n't workin ' right !
MCCOOL: What 's our go-to-shit plan , O'Neil ?
SLUTNIK: This ai n't even workin ' wrong !
FLEA: Really do n't wan na be captured , el- tee . Heard some bad things .
JORDAN: Fuck . Basher-Basher , this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction . Stand by for a PRC fix
MCCOOL: 32 feet , six inches !
JORDAN: I 'm lookin ' , I 'm lookin ' !
MCCOOL: Smoke it ! Jordan chucks a smoke grenade .
FLEA: Where are you HEY ! Where are you taking her ?
JORDAN: How long ? Please , HOW LONG ?
WICKWIRE: One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline . This is , like , right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense . So his crew does a nighttime infil , maps all the big artillery placements and stuff , then turns around to get the hell gone . But etween them and the water are five Libyan guards , all armed to the nuts .
JORDAN: They had to kill 'em ?
WICKWIRE: Nah , they were dead-ass asleep . But on every guard 's chest , they left one Marlboro cigarette . Just a little calling card to say they 'd been there and could come back any time they wanted .
JORDAN: That 's a good story .
WICKWIRE: So the shit you got ta go through ? To get from here to there ? Brothe said it was worth it . Worth the training worth the divorce worth anything .
JORDAN: He was married ?
WICKWIRE: At first .
JORDAN: You got anybody , Wick ?
WICKWIRE: Not me . You ?
JORDAN: How 'd you make it last time , Wick ? How 'd you get through this part ?
WICKWIRE: Last time I did n't .
JORDAN: Let 's keep talkin ' , Wick . Just keep talkin ' to me
ROYCE: Suitable for framing
THE SPOOK: Subject ?
ROYCE: O'Neil , Jordan .
THE SPOOK: Thought you two were file-closed .
ROYCE: You knew about us ?
THE SPOOK: Sorry . Thought you knew I knew .
ROYCE: Computer no transcription , no com-link , no data-link . In fact shut-down sequence 0-Niner-0-8 , mark .
THE SPOOK: All right . So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way ?
ROYCE: The E-Ringers ? Full integration is gon na cost the services billions at the worst possible time when Congress is already swinging the axe .
THE SPOOK: Congress cuts , military bleeds . But Pentagon 's a big place . Let 's narrow the sights .
ROYCE: The Navy ? They 've made it clea they do n't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women 's heads . What 's it gon na cost to make a fleet of Trident 's co-ed ?
THE SPOOK: Sabotage born of economics ? Would n't be a first . But is Hayes eally going to start his watch with such a public failure ?
ROYCE: Possibly . Just to spite DeHaven .
THE SPOOK: Hmm . Let 's aim higher . Royce blinks . `` What 's higher ? ''
ROYCE: The first female President ?
THE SPOOK: Do n't for a second think she did n't leak this story . `` G.I . Jane '' gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the iggest constituency of them all .
ROYCE: Women .
THE SPOOK: If you were the President , would n't that put a little piss in you shoes ?
ROYCE: I do n't know . Seems
THE SPOOK: This ai n't about some little soldie girl sloggin ' her way through commando school . The implications go way beyond .
ROYCE: Christ , I do n't want to see her take a fall . She thinks I do , but
THE SPOOK: I take it this file is still open .
ROYCE: Even tough I do n't talk to her every day I still talk to her every day . Know what I mean ?
THE SPOOK: Okay , so now work it from the othe end . Think about California and how things might be handled there .
ROYCE: I do n't What , someone on base ? A `` mole '' ?
THE SPOOK: This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook . but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case , that 's how I 'd do it . A man-in-place . Makes everything very controllable .
THE CHIEF: What is your father 's name ?
JORDAN: `` Dad . ''
THE CHIEF: Any brothers ? Sisters ?
JORDAN: Dick , Jane , and Spot .
THE CHIEF: Are you hungry ? What 's you favorite food ? We 'll try to get it for you .
JORDAN: Green Eggs and Ham . You 're not going to get anywhere . You might as well put me in the cage .
THE CHIEF: You are in the cage , O'Neil . Right here , right now .
JORDAN: Should I be afraid ?
THE CHIEF: Right down to your worthless womb , and I 'll tell you why . This is my island . My world . And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world . Take another scan of my little joy- oy outside . If I can do that to a Navy Seal , what 's gon na happen to you ? Huh ?
JORDAN: Was n't deemed a threat .
THE CHIEF: She led us right to you . That 's no threat ?
JORDAN: No . Yes . I mean , depends on
THE CHIEF: The others already told me , O'Neil . They wanted to shoot , but you would n't let them . Because you went soft on another women
JORDAN: That 's not right .
THE CHIEF: That 's what your crew said . Are they lying ? Or are you ?
JORDAN: I think you 're the liar .
THE CHIEF: I 'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage . You wear the bars , you made the call , and you got your whole crew
JORDAN: We did n't know we were compromised . Firing would only 've given away ou position .
THE CHIEF: You think we should go easy on women , O'Neil ?
JORDAN: No .
THE CHIEF: I 'm so glad we agree .
JORDAN: Sure . Just like your men do .
THE CHIEF: I think we oughtta practice it , just so you know what to expect .
JORDAN: Should I practice bleeding , too , sir ? Would that make me a bette soldier ?
THE CHIEF: Any of you can stop this ! Just give me the location of one more hide- site , and it ends right here ! In the pen
SLUTNIK: Someone 's trippin ' out here
THE CHIEF: Three crews are still on this island somewhere . Who knows where ? The men trade itchy looks . Some do know .
JORDAN: Do n't do it , do n't do it The Chief throws her down like garbage .
THE CHIEF: Who 's gon na tell me ? Who 's gon na be chivalrous and stop this abuse ? What , you want to see her get mauled ? Is that it ?
JORDAN: Do n't tell him shi
THE CHIEF: She 's fine ! When I put you down , O'Neil , take the hint and stay down .
MCCOOL: Down stay down Hearing , the Chief turns back to see Jordan wobbling to her feet . Eye-lock .
JORDAN: Fuck you and the boat you rode in on . Sir .
THE CHIEF: We 're done here . Beaten , he walks right out of camp .
JORDAN: Make you a deal , Flea . Never tell me how I look and I 'll never tell you .
THE CHIEF: You do n't think she 'd be raped if she were captured ? You do n't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men ?
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: You broke a dozen training rules ack there before I lost count .
THE CHIEF: I 've had it . Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter does n't mean I 'm gon na be one .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: She 's a trainee , just like the others . Why are you coming down so hard ?
THE CHIEF: She 's an officer . There 's a highe standard .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: She 's a women , and that 's why you 're idin ' her bareback .
THE CHIEF: Of course it is . And I 'm gon na stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing , that real lives are gon na be lost . Maybe mine , maybe yours .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: I oughtta report you .
THE CHIEF: I think you probably would if you did n't know I was right .
DEHAVEN: Yes ?
HAYES: Without telling us they do this ? With absolutely no lead time ?
JORDAN: Sorry , did n't mean to
WICKWIRE: That 's okay . Just an ex-girlfriend . And know I remember why .
JORDAN: First big night of liberty and no date ? You 're pathetic , Wickwire .
WICKWIRE: Maybe I 'll just head over to McP 's with the others , have a drink o four . Do n't wan na come , do you ?
JORDAN: I ca n't go out . Not like this .
WICKWIRE: I think you look beautiful .
JORDAN: Thanks for lying . But you 're the class officer , Wick , and it 'd just e weird if we hook up . Besides Catching up , Blondell exits the exchange .
BLONDELL: Sorry . Forgot I needed oregano and
JORDAN: Do you , uh , know
WICKWIRE: Sure , sure .
JORDAN: We 're going over to her place to make salad and pasta . Just , you know , nothing special .
WICKWIRE: Okay . Well thought I 'd ask .
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: underwater detonation devices employ mechanical timers , and as such , they are subject to variances due to water temperature . That 's why when clearing mines , we always use two timers . The charts now eing passed out contain calculations you must memorize efore
JORDAN: Sir ?
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS: You 're wanted at the C.O . 's .
YEOMAN: This way , lieutenant . They 're expecting you .
JORDAN: See me , sir ? The C.O . and X.O . are both here .
WICKWIRE: I 'm sorry , O'Neil . But as class officer , it 's my obligation to eport all violations .
JORDAN: This is insane . You 've got no proof .
WICKWIRE: I wish I did n't have to do this , Jordan .
JORDAN: Sir , I just want you to know that this is either a gross mistake or someone 's vindictive bullshit . In no way did anything happen etween Ensign Blondell and myself . We 're just friends .
MCCOOL: So what 'd he want ? O'Neil ?
FLEA: Oh , no no , no , no , no
THE CHIEF: Stand fast !
ROYCE: I want to kill them I want to kill the guys who made you cry like this
JORDAN: All I wanted was an honest chance . And If I could n't get it , I could n't stay .
ROYCE: And this class officer `` Wickwire . '' You think he was just trying to get even ? Striking back for
JORDAN: Maybe . Though it did n't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it . Almost like Did I say he was class officer ?
ROYCE: Almost like someone put him up to it . Okay , who ?
JORDAN: No shortage of suspects .
ROYCE: The Chief ? Or maybe even Turrentine ? Your C.O. ? She looks at him sidelong .
JORDAN: Royce . Tell me you did n't keep a file on me .
ROYCE: Somebody was yankin ' your stings , Jordan maybe from 3,000 miles away . I wanted to know who . I still do . She shakes her head , resisting .
JORDAN: It 's done with , Royce . Let it go .
ROYCE: Someone screwed you over like this , left unanswered charges hanging ove your head , and you 're not gon na fight back ?
JORDAN: I 'm tired of fighting back . I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world , okay ?
ROYCE: Well , before you crawl off to die , Jordan , give me five minutes of good headwork .
JORDAN: What about him .
ROYCE: Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy .
JORDAN: I do n't know , I do n't care .
ROYCE: Well , pardon me if I do . Now who else ? Who could 've leveraged a class officer like that ? C'mon , Jordan , keep your head in the game .
JORDAN: `` In Washington ''
ROYCE: What ?
JORDAN: Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado
ROYCE: `` Wickwire , Thomas Dane '' Second un at Coronado and correct , they had him stashed in the `` Appropriation Liaison Office , '' whatever that is .
JORDAN: You do n't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country . He 's got a Sea Daddy somewhere .
ROYCE: I 'd sure like to know who .
JORDAN: Yeah . Me too .
BLONDELL: Administration , Ensign Blondell .
D.C. COP: Do n't even dream about leaving that vehicle there .
ROYCE: Government car tow it if you want . Just point us to DeHaven 's office first .
NAVY CAPTAIN: Commander .
ROYCE: Get started here . I 'll catch up .
SECRETARY: Your name again ?
JORDAN: Lieutenant j.g . O'Neil .
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: Ms. O'Neil . Yes , of course . I 'm Douglas Champeau . Unfortunately , the Senator is in chamber right now . How can I help you ?
JORDAN: What chamber ? Which way is that ?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: I mean , she 's on the floor of the Senate .
JORDAN: Okay , which way ?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: She really ca n't be disturbed . But if you care to wait , I 'll find you an office with a phone . It might be several hours , but A TOURIST pokes in .
TOURIST: 'Scuse me , but I 'm here to pick up gallery tickets ? Are you
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: See the secretary , please .
JORDAN: DeHaven Now she looks up to behold
DEHAVEN: Cloak room . I 'll meet her there . Just her .
JORDAN: Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire . About to hug Jordan , DeHaven stops awkwardly .
DEHAVEN: Sounds familiar .
JORDAN: It should . You nominated him fo Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me .
DEHAVEN: Jordan . Might we do this over lunch tomorrow ? I do very much want to talk , but now is scarcely
JORDAN: Did you set me up ? Did you set me up just to see me fail ?
DEHAVEN: Absolutely not .
JORDAN: What changed ?
DEHAVEN: Should probably ask him that .
JORDAN: If I have to ask again , Senator , I 'll be asking in front of cameras .
DOORKEEPER: Madam Senator ? Your esteemed colleagues are requesting
DEHAVEN: Two seconds , Walter . In 1981 , the Supreme Court was asked to rule on the issue of women in combat positions . The Court cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws as a legal foundation for keeping women ineligible . That decision held for all these years until the White House , 10 days ago , moved to have the Exclusion Laws voided . To demolish that legal foundation .
JORDAN: So ? Is n't the President jumping on your bandwagon ?
DEHAVEN: What he did was light the bandwagon on fire . Because he knows what I know that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm 's way .
JORDAN: You do n't know that .
DEHAVEN: In face , I do Roper , Harris , Gallop they all come back the same .
JORDAN: What are you saying ? That a women 's life is more valuable than a man 's ? That a women 's death hurts a family more ?
DEHAVEN: I 'm saying it 's not going to happen . Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him . He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and , quite possibly , for bringing them ack in body bags .
JORDAN: You were never going to let women serve in combat . You always had a safety net . Or thought you did .
DEHAVEN: Jordan . I do n't expect you to fully understand this but sometimes there 's more to be gained from the fight than the victory .
JORDAN: So the rhetoric gets you headlines . But the reality gets you in trouble .
DEHAVEN: The reality is this We send fa too many men off to war . I do n't need to compound the problem with women . Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life ? Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with
JORDAN: I wanted the choice . The chance to prove myself , my skills , my work , me . That 's how it should 've been .
DOORKEEPER: Madam Senator , once again I must
DEHAVEN: Just hold the goddamn clock , Walter .
JORDAN: You promise Wickwire a fast ticket , too ?
DEHAVEN: I 've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing egan . And that 's quite verifiable .
JORDAN: I 'm sure it is .
DEHAVEN: You 'll think about my offer ?
JORDAN: You know , I wonder what the SecNav would think about it . If I spoke with him .
DEHAVEN: Well , I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself and told him the deal was off . No more test cases . He was only too happy to oblige . Do n't play politics with me , little darlin ' . You 'd be up way past you edtime .
DOORKEEPER: Madam Senator , please
DEHAVEN: I 'll call you in a few days .
JORDAN: So I wonder what the President would think .
THE CHIEF: Well , I 'm trying to figure out if you 're stupid , unlucky , gluttonous or some new alloy of all three .
JORDAN: Good to see you again , too , sir .
THE CHIEF: Okay , O'Neil . So you 've impressed all the others . Now try me .
JORDAN: One-second intervals ! Go !
FLEA: C'mon , c'mon
CORTEZ: This tank 's not gon na cut it , el- tee . Handle 's stripped .
SLUTNIK: I just wonder how that happened .
JORDAN: Cortez , see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear . Try a wrench on that thing .
THE CHIEF: What happening ? !
PILOT: Fucking pelicans ! Hang on !
MCCOOL: What the shit is
SLUTNIK: You do n't suppose this is just part of
FLEA: CUT IT ! CUT IT HERE !
JORDAN: Flea , 'Cool , Cortez , Newman take your minis , hit the water . Go , GO !
SLUTNIK: Maybe we should call the Coast Guard .
JORDAN: Shut your hole , Slutnik .
MCCOOL: Visibility drops dead at 40 feet . If they 're deeper than that The others surface and swim in .
CORTEZ: Nobody 's comin ' outta that crash , el-tee . Nobody .
JORDAN: Basher One , this is O'Neil . We are arely reading you . What is you situation ?
THE CHIEF: Got one other heartbeat here , looks touch and go . I 've got a questionable leg .
JORDAN: Chief , sir rescue team wo n't be here for 15 minutes . What 's you air situation ? Over .
THE CHIEF: That may not be adequate .
FLEA: If we could just fix on him
MCCOOL: Beacon 's a no-go for us .
JORDAN: Chief did I see a flare box aboard ? And can you get at it ? Over .
FLEA: Six o'clock ! Marking , marking !
JORDAN: Spotted you , Chief . Pri One is to slip you some air , so we 're coming down with a tank just something until the A-team shows . Over . An ominous beat .
MCCOOL: What ?
THE CHIEF: This mission was n't about tagging mines . It was to see how you coped with mechanical failures . Pretty fuckin ' ironic , huh ?
SLUTNIK: He 's circlin ' the drain , el-tee .
JORDAN: So we got two full mini-tanks , three minutes each . 'Cool ? How much ai in yours ?
MCCOOL: Maybe half . Not even .
JORDAN: Grab an oar , find a way to weight it down , we 're gon na need it . Cortez , help him . Flea ? You take one of the two full minis and just follow my lead .
CORTEZ: What , we 're gon na pry 'em out with paddles ?
MCCOOL: O'Neil . Our air 's gon na crap out as soon as we get down there . You know that , do n't you ?
JORDAN: So I guess we get one shot at it .
THE CHIEF: Why 'd it have to be her
JORDAN: Chief , sir still with me ?
CHIEF: Take him first . Once he 's clear , come back with
JORDAN: Sir , let me suggest you stop giving orders and start doing exactly what I say , because that 's the only way we 're all getting out of here . Now how 's your vest check out ? Still good ?
THE CHIEF: O'Neil
JORDAN: Shut up , sir . I 'm concentrating .
MCCOOL: Hoooooo-yah !
NEWBERRY: Go , go , go , go !
SLUTNIK: Uh-huh ! That 's right ! Just like we always practice it !
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: Senator DeHaven is here for the graduation ceremonies .
BASE GUARD: What are all these other vehicles ?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: Just a small press corps . Routine .
BASE GUARD: And that pickup truck at the end ?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE: That ? That would be the all-woman America 's Cup team .
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Lieutenant ? I was asked to give you this .
JORDAN: The Navy Cross
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: I believe he earned it for saving a man 's life in Saudi Arabia . He wanted you to have it . He was very clear on that point .
JORDAN: I was looking for him earlier , ut
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: The Chief was granted early etirement as of 17-hundred yesterday . By 18-hundred he was gone . Out of the Navy .
JORDAN: Just a coincidence ?
INSTRUCTOR PYRO: Maybe it 's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts . But I think the Chief knew that his way his world had come and gone . Jordan nods , understanding .
DEHAVEN: of course , we always prefe peace to war . But if we 're going to war , give women a piece . Give them the choice to defend their country . And if the President does n't like that idea if he wants to continue to deny women their equal rights then I 'll be happy to step out back with him any time , anywhere
JORDAN: So here we are again . Staring three years of operational duty in the face .
ROYCE: Look . It 's not like you 'd be completely out of reach . And maybe we could call in a few favors , get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado . There are ways of dealing with these things I mean , if people are so inclined .
JORDAN: Which is guy-speak for
ROYCE: `` Yes , Jordan I 'll wait for you no matter how long . '' Finally , the right answer .
MCCULLEN: Still using matchlocks , are ya ? I can get you a pair of flintlocks , you let me sneak out of here .
TEMPTED: Good ones ?
MCCULLEN: The best . From Spain . And perhaps a couple of pretty young ladies to teach you how to use them .
GUARD #2: On yer feet , you Scottish pig .
WARDEN: James McCullen , you have been found guilty of treason for the sale of military arms to the enemies of ou Lord King Louis XIII even whilst you sold arms to our Lord himself .
MCCULLEN: Your King is a vile bag of filth who murders his own allies . I should 've charged him double .
WARDEN: You tried to overthrow the Crown in conspiracy with its enemies !
MCCULLEN: They offered me a Chancellorship , ecause unlike your simpleton King , they know that is the McCullen destiny , to run the wars , the true power , not simply to supply arms .
WARDEN: Do you have anything else to say efore the sentence is carried out ?
MCCULLEN: Yes , I do . Clan McCullen is fa igger and more powerful than any of you could ever imagine . My sons will continue to rise along after I am gone . As will their sons . And , God willing , their sons .
SMILES: It shall not end with my death . The Warden smiles back sinisterly .
WARDEN: Oh , we 're not going to kill you , McCullen . We 're going to make an example of you .
MCCULLEN: Tragic as they are to fight , wars must be won . But perhaps they do n't have to be as destructive as they 've been in the past .
HAWK: Guess you 'll be the first arms dealer up for the Nobel Peace Prize .
MCCULLEN: I prefer the term `` armament solutions engineer '' Gentlemen ! I 'm pleased to announce that tomorrow morning your first order of nanotech warheads will ship from my factory in Kyrgyzstan .
DUKE: The hell 's wrong with you , Stalworth , you did n't eat that Chicken A La King at chow did ya ?
STALWORTH: The mission , sir
DUKE: What about it ? Another day , anothe un .
STALWORTH: Never had anything to worry about efore .
DUKE: You 're off the mission .
STALWORTH: Sir ?
DUKE: That 's what you want , right ?
STALWORTH: I I guess I can live with that .
DUKE: Then you should .
HAWK: Mr McCullen , Clayton Aernathy , British Army .
MCCULLEN: I know who you are General hawk . As sharp in a briefing room as you eputation is on the battlefield .
HAWK: Not hardly You gave me a broad target , I could n't resist .
MCCULLEN: It 's an honor to meet a man of you many accomplishments .
HAWK: Your warheads . Securing them in transit . Forty pairs of ears in that room now know the when and where .
MCCULLEN: Those `` ears '' all have top security clearance .
HAWK: We both know what that 's worth .
MCCULLEN: Look , General , delivery is my esponsibility and it 's not one I take lightly . I had NATO assign an elite American Special Forces unit , a fully armored convoy with ai support . I assure you , my warheads will be quite safe .
HAWK: I 've made a career of showing up where I 'm needed , whether ordered to or not . And if your warheads are half as effective as you say they are.. Then my unit is needed .
MCCULLEN: This is no time to play catch up . The NATO team 's been drilling fo weeks . They 're lit up and ready to oll .
HAWK: My unit does n't need mission specific training . They 're chosen ecause of their ability to handle any situation .
MCCULLEN: Maybe next time , General What did you say your unit was called ?
HAWK: I did n't . I just said they were always ready .
DUKE: All right , listen up , the Cougars will be front and back , Grizzly in the middle carrying the package . Minimum distance at all times . Choppers will cover us overhead . The Lab Workers step up .
RIPCORD: Not gon na explode , is it ?
LAB WORKER: They 're not weaponized yet . And the kill switches are attached to the launchers . All the same , I 'd avoid potholes if I were you .
RIPCORD: Why not stick it in a chopper and fly it out ? If you want , I could
DUKE: We have our orders . Okay , people ! We 're on the clock , let 's move .
DUKE: Mother Goose , this is Bird Dog . We have the package and are on the dot to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900 .
RIPCORD: You know , I hate all the Mothe Goose , bird Dog crap , I just wish they 'd let us say , `` Hey , Pete , it 's Bill , see ya in a few . ''
DUKE: Not me , I joined up for the jargon .
RIPCORD: Just saying , you know , if I ran things
DUKE: Rip , if you ran the Army we 'd stay up all night , fill our canteen with tequila , and call each other `` Bro '' .
RIPCORD: But we 'd be badasses , right Bro ?
DUKE: Yeah , we 'd be badasses . Eyes on the oad , Rip .
RIPCORD: Hey Duke , ya know how they always tell you to empty your head of distracting thoughts on these runs ?
DUKE: Keep your eyes on the road , Rip .
RIPCORD: And you know how people sometimes joke that it must be easy fr me to keep my mind empty ?
DUKE: Do n't listen to 'em . you got plenty of thoughts up there . Keep rear security tight , boys .
RIPCORD: Well , the second I try and make myself not have thoughts , I always have 'em . Like now , know what I 'm thinking about ?
DUKE: Please do n't say the Air Forces .
RIPCORD: The Air Forces .
DUKE: I thought we were done with that discussion .
RIPCORD: You were done with it , not me . Look , I loev flying
DUKE: I do n't think your daddy 's crop duster counts as hours logged .
RIPCORD: Jets , man , jets . You know I always qualify when I 'm on leave .
DUKE: Yeah , yeah , look , you want to get up in the air , we 'll get you a trampoline back at the base .
RIPCORD: We 've done ten years in the Army , I just think we should see if the grass really is greener .
DUKE: This continues to be the stupidest idea you 've ever come up with , nd that 's saying something .
RIPCORD: Funny . Real funny .
DUKE: I do n't wan na transfer to the Ai Force , okay ?
RIPCORD: It 's always about you , is n't it ? Give me one good reason ?
DUKE: I want to be in the fight , not flying over it .
RIPCORD: Wo n't be saying that when you call in an air strike and I come screaming in to save your
DUKE: Eyes on the road , Rip .
RIPCORD: Hey , on the training run were n't there herders around here ? This puts Duke instantly on the alert .
DUKE: Back up ! Back up ! Back up ! Mother Goose , this is Bird Dog . We are under attack . Repeat we are under attack !
DAZED: Yeah , except for all the blood .
RIPCORD: Duke ?
DUKE: Shut up .
RIPCORD: If I die
DUKE: You 're not gon na die .
RIPCORD: I just want you to know you neve could run worth a damn .
DUKE: Jesus , Rip .
RIPCORD: I 'm just saying , it 's be nice if you could move a little faster .
DUKE: Stay here .
RIPCORD: Sure .
DUKE: I 'm gettin ' that package .
ANA: Hello , Duke
DUKE: Air Force.. .right .
HEAVY DUTY: Time to lay down some bass !
DUKE: Ana !
SCARLETT: The warheads !
DUKE: Stand down ! Stand the hell down !
HEAVY DUTY: Lower your weapon , Sir . We 're not the enemy .
DUKE: Pointing weapons at me does n't make you my friend .
BREAKER: Please hand over the case , sir .
DUKE: I do n't know who you are , and I sure as hell do n't know who they are , and until I find out , I 'm not lowering anything or handling anything over .
RIPCORD: What 's your unit ?
SCARLETT: That 's classified .
BREAKER: Someone would like a word with you .
HAWK: State you name and rank .
DUKE: .you first .
HAWK: My team just saved your life . now 's the part where you say `` thank you '' .
DUKE: Those are n't the words that come to mind just now . We were n't told about any support for this mission , so you better tell your team to stand down . Ripcord eyes his sight .
RIPCORD: Happy to turn this into a turkey shoot .
HAWK: You must be Ripcord , expert marksman , weapons specialist , jet
RIPCORD: Told ya .
HAWK: I 'm General Clayton Abernathy . You may have heard of me , .Duke .
DUKE: General hawk . Afghanistan , NATO Forward Command
HAWK: That was my last job . I 'm in a whole new outfit now .
BREAKER: Just need to deactivate its tracking beacon , for security .
HAWK: Hand over the weapons case son , and let us deliver the warheads .
DUKE: No way . I signed for 'em . My mission , my package . I carry them , I deliver them .
BREAKER: Was n't hard , was it ?
DUKE: Fine . But you seem to be a little short on transportation a the moment . Team Alpha will deliver you to me .
HAWK: Come see for yourself .
RIPCORD: Hey , you 're cute .
SCARLETT: He 's going into shock .
RIPCORD: What 's your name , darlin ' ?
SCARLETT: I thought all the Special Ops guys were tough .
RIPCORD: We are tough . but also sensitive . Whoa , that 's some mucho primo stuff you gave me .
HEAVY DUTY: The name 's Heavy Duty . Duke has the weapons case on his lap .
DUKE: What kind of outfit is this ? Not egular Army based on the accents . I have you as an Aussie And you 're a Johannesburger And you French North Africa . Algiers ?
BREAKER: Tunisia . Where were you born ?
RIPCORD: Are you kidding me ? Duke was n't orn , he was Government-Issued !
DUKE: But somehow you 're all in the same unit . One you ca n't tell me the name of right ?
SCARLETT: We 'd get tossed for telling .
RIPCORD: Duke , Duke , do n't you get it they 're super secret , they 're Mission Impossible . This tape 's gon na self-destruct in five
DUKE: You 're gon na go after them are n't you ? The ones that hit my convoy .
SILENCE: Then whoever you are , whatever this unit is , I want in .
BREAKER: Not our call .
RIPCORD: I want in too . That way we can spend some bunker time together .
SCARLETT: You two a team or something ?
RIPCORD: We 've been together forever . But not like that . Hi , I 'm Ripcord .
SCARLETT: Why do they call you that ? Breaker laughs , reading Ripcord 's file
BREAKER: Because his name is Wallace Weems !
DUKE: General .
HAWK: I 've read a lot about you two .
RIPCORD: Okay , look , I did n't `` steal '' that Blackhawk , I was borrowing it
HAWK: Matter of fact , I saw that one of my subordinates tried to recruit you to our little operation a while ack .
DUKE: I was never asked to join any Op group .
HAWK: Remember a tall gentleman approaching you in Thailand when you were on leave , four years ago ?
DUKE: Vaguely .
HAWK: Right before you tore up the bar ?
RIPCORD: Four years ? My man had some issues .
DUKE: This does n't look like any Tac Op I 've ever seen . Where are we ?
HAWK: Okay , you trusted me by going with my team , so I 'll trust you .
RIPCORD: Oh man , I want one of those .
BREAKER: The suit or the girl ?
RIPCORD: Both .
HAWK: Ten nations signed on in thei first year . Working together , sharing intel . Now we have twenty- three .
DUKE: I 've never seen combat gear this sleek , what 's the trick ?
SCARLETT: Liquid armor .
RIPCORD: Who could possibly fund all this ?
HEAVY DUTY: Oprah .
HAWK: Patch him through , please .
DUKE: So who hit us out there ?
COVER GIRL: Currently unidentified .
HEAVY DUTY: And how 'd that bitch in leather get a jump jet like ours ?
SCARLETT: Whoever she is , she 's clearly well- financed , with access to highly classified intel and state of the art weaponry . Their capabilities are beyond anything we 've eve encountered .
RIPCORD: That 's the reason we got our asses kicked . Duke betrays nothing . Hawk looks at him .
HAWK: We 're going to need to find out everything we can about her . Knowing is half the battle .
RIPCORD: What 's the other half ?
HAWK: Gentlemen , this is James McCullen , CEO of MARS Industries , the man who uilt these warheads .
MCCULLEN: General , most men I 've encountered in this business over-promise and under-deliver . You 're the opposite . Clearly , you were the security option I should have chosen .
DUKE: My team did everything we could out there . A lot of good men went down
MCCULLEN: But not you .
DUKE: That mission was classified , sir . Clearly , somebody sold us out .
MCCULLEN: I 've spent ten years and thirteen illion Euros creating these fou warheads . Your job , Captain , was to protect them , and if it was n't fo General Hawk , you would 've failed .
HAWK: That 's not a fair assessment . He followed his orders to the letter .
MCCULLEN: Well that was n't enough . Duke bristles . McCullen turns to Hawk .
HAWK: Apologizes , Mr McCullen . It 's not that I do n't trust youI do n't trust anybody .
SMILES: Are you sure you 're not a McCullen ?
HAWK: I do n't talk smooth enough to be a McCullen .
MCCULLEN: You do just fine , General . Now , so the bastards who attacked you ca n't find you , you need to disable the tracking beacon hidden in the case .
BREAKER: We already have .
MCCULLEN: Good man . So , can I count on you to deliver the warheads to NATO now ?
HAWK: I think it unwise to expose them at the moment . This group might make another attempt .
MCCULLEN: Alright . But allow me to check the warheads to see if any have been damaged .
BREAKER: My scan says they 're intact
MCCULLEN: General ?
HAWK: What 's the code ? ON DUKE , listening carefully .
MCCULLEN: Five-two-nine-four-four-oh .
SCARLETT: Breaker ?
BREAKER: That bloke 's Beta waves were going up , down , and sideways I think he 's hiding something .
MCCULLEN: I spend five years setting this up . Wringing money out of NATO . This was supposed to be the easy part .
ANA: If you 'd let me stage the assault at your precious factory , we could have contained the situation .
MCCULLEN: And lost the trust of our clients in the process ? It had to be NATO 's fault . What happened ? Did you hesitate ?
ANA: You 're implying this was about some ancient history ? That 's as laughable as your Intel . What went wrong was the Joes appearing out of nowhere . He stares at her suspiciously , then softens .
MCCULLEN: Forgive me , jealousy is n't my strong suit .
ANA: Forget that , where are we now ? Have you tracked the case ?
MCCULLEN: They deactivated the beacon . I gave them a code to quietly re-arm it .
ANA: I will get those warheads back .
MCCULLEN: I hope so .
ANA: If I were really there , I might actually let you touch me .
MCCULLEN: I 'll send a jet .
ANA: Business first . Besides , I 'm married , remember ?
MCCULLEN: Sometimes I really hate technology . He sighs heavily , then hears a VOICE
STORM SHADOW: If you had sent me , it would be done .
MCCULLEN: I 'm sending you now , Storm Shadow . To the Baroness 's villa . .Make sure her commitment does n't waiver .
THE DOCTOR: Welcome back .
MCCULLEN: Good to be back .
THE DOCTOR: we 've been very busy .
MCCULLEN: Is it working ?
THE DOCTOR: You tell me .
MCCULLEN: English , Doctor .
THE DOCTOR: They feel no fear .
MCCULLEN: Doctor .
THE DOCTOR: They feel no pain .
MCCULLEN: And they are completely obedient ?
THE DOCTOR: Of course . .The real world applications are endless .
MCCULLEN: You 've done well . You 've thrown the caber clear out of the yard .
THE DOCTOR: But research and science are expensive propositions . If I can make a suggestion.. ?
MCCULLEN: I appreciate your thirst fo knowledge , Doctor . But this world is messy enough . Factions fighting and scrabbling for control , fo esources , and it 's only going to get worse as the century progresses . No . What the world needs is unification . Leadership .
LAUGHS: The French
BREAKER: We grabbed an image from Heavy- Duty 's helmet cam .
RIPCORD: Hey , that 's
BREAKER: Now we can run the face through an infinity scan .
HAWK: We have access to any photograph on any server anywhere in the world .
BREAKER: Everyone gets photographed in some way at some time . ATM machines , airports , crowd shots at a football game . We 'll find her .
RIPCORD: You okay ?
DUKE: .what happened to her ?
HAWK: From NATO . I am now the official custodian of the warheads . You mission is complete . Once you hand it over , that is .
DUKE: When you move it , she 's gon na come after you , you know that , right ? And with her Intel , and her toys she 'll find you .
HAWK: And your point is ?
DUKE: You 're going to go after her first . And I want to help .
RIPCORD: Let us in on this , General . Ou team just got wasted . I think a little payback is in order .
HAWK: You do n't ask to be a part of GI JOE . You get asked .
DUKE: You scouted me four years ago , now I 'm ready . Let 's have at it .
HAWK: I 've lost men too , Captain . Good men . But attempting to
DUKE: I know her .
HAWK: Excuse me ?
DUKE: You said knowing is half the attle . Well , I know who she is .
HAWK: Before this goes any further , I need to know what I 'm dealing with , a man looking to settle a score , o a man who can put the mission first . Because the battlefield is the wrong place for emotion . Could you kill her ?
DUKE: If I had to .
HAWK: Chances are you will . But if you flinch , hesitate even an instant what I 'm trying to say is , unless you can kill her graveyard dead I do n't want you .
DUKE: I can . I signed on to deliver those warheads , General , and despite you present authority , I want to finish the job . Hawk regards him for a moment .
HAWK: So tell me about her .
DUKE: Okay , I 'll start right here I hope that vault is tight , because she always gets what she wants
DECOBRAY: Hello , darling .
ANA: How is work at the lab ?
DECOBRAY: Steady progress .
ANA: So the Minister of Defense was pleased ?
DECOBRAY: He was . You know I wish I could tell you more
ANA: Of course .
DECOBRAY: You were gone a long time . How were the shops in Monte Carlo ?
ANA: I did n't get what I was after . They head up the stairs .
DECOBRAY: I suppose I should be grateful .
ANA: Most husbands would be .
DECOBRAY: Most husbands do n't have such mysterious wives , they know exactly where they are and what they do .
TEASING: They think they know .
ANA: I never get over how beautiful
DECOBRAY: Neither do I .
ANA: Let me change and freshen up and I 'll meet you for dinner .
DECOBRAY: Of course .
STORM SHADOW: Mr. McCullen gave me explicit orders to sever the Baron 's spine if he so much as touched you .
ANA: He 's my husband , of course he touches me . Tell McCullen to grow up . Besides , the Baron says his work in the lab goes much bette after we 've touched . And that 's the important thing .
STORM SHADOW: I 'll be accompanying you to etrieve the warheads this time . Along with some of the men the Doctor 's been working on .
ANA: The Doctor .
STORM SHADOW: We go at dawn .
RIPCORD: My hot tub only holds four .
COUNTS: No , five .
DUKE: I 've been wanting to do this before we deploy .
ANA: Dukeit 's beautiful . It 's too nice you lunatic .
DUKE: Only time I 'm buying one of these , so why not ?
REX: I was coming to offer you a ride ack to post .
ANA: Time already ?
DUKE: We go at oh-five hundred .
ANA: Is it WMDs ? It is , right ? That 's why you 're pulling Rex out of the
DUKE: Ana , we ca n't
ANA: Yeah , yeah . Classified . Top Secret . Have to kill me if you told me , blah , blah , blah .
DUKE: Speaking of classified information , you still have n't answered .
ANA: Yes . Of course it 's yes . On one
DUKE: I promise .
RIPCORD: How was I supposed know she was married ! ? Nice rock ! Hey , are you proposing ?
DUKE: I 'm done proposing .
ANA: I already said yes .
RIPCORD: Not official until you answer my question . Do you love my boy ?
ANA: Always and forever .
RIPCORD: Now I 've got ta find someone to love me , as many times as possible fo the next three hours .
HEAVY DUTY: If you want to join us , you 'll need to be mission ready , Joe style . This is the Mark One Accelerato Suit .
RIPCORD: What 's it accelerate ?
HEAVY DUTY: You . It 'll make you run faster , jump higher , and hit harder than any of your enemies .
RIPCORD: I just missed everything you said . How do I look ? Pretty cool , huh ?
SCARLETT: Sixty-three seconds . Not Bad . But not good enough . Got ta get under a minute to qualify .
DUKE: What 's the record ?
SCARLETT: Forty-five .
RIPCORD: Do n't tell me , Snake-Eyes ?
SCARLETT: No , me .
RIPCORD: You can do this whole course with that thing in forty-five seconds ?
SCARLETT: If you 're going to shoot at something , kill it . Otherwise take up knitting .
RIPCORD: When I want something , I do n't just shoot at it When I get a target in my sights , I take it down .
SCARLETT: Here . Go on . Try it .
RIPCORD: I would n't want to show you up .
SCARLETT: Oh , that 's so thoughtful of you .
RIPCORD: What can I tell you ? I guess I 'm just a considerate , humble guy . You 'll learn that about me .
SCARLETT: I 'm the `` target in your sights , '' ight ? You 've got ten rounds to `` take me down '' .
RIPCORD: I do n't want to hurt you .
SCARLETT: They 're training arrows . The most I 'll feel is a little jolt .
DUKE: C'mon , Rip .
SCARLETT: Guess you did n't really want me that bad , rip .
BREAKER: Aw , Ripcord 's heart just skipped a eat . Is n't that sweet ?
DUKE: Again .
ANA: The foundation of this fence is a hundred feet deep . No going under .
STORM SHADOW: All that matters is the mission .
ANA: Is there any other ?
HEAVY DUTY: You can learn a whole hell of a lot about a girl by the way she dances . Tell me I 'm wrong Snake-Eyes .
SCARLETT: No , he does n't . Do you ?
RIPCORD: What ? You say something ?
BREAKER: Sorry , Scarlett , got ta go with Heavy D on this one .
SCARLETT: You 're going to teach me science ? I read all about the positron emission tomography studies concerning sex pheromones when I was twelve . I 'm just saying , it 's not very romantic .
RIPCORD: Heavy told me she graduated college at twelve .
DUKE: You like her , I get it already .
BREAKER: You ca n't learn this stuff in a ook , Scarlett . You have to at least kiss a guy , before you 're an expert on romance .
SCARLETT: Who am I shooting first ? The laughter stops . Rip looks surprised .
RIPCORD: You have n't kissed anyone ?
DUKE: Really firing on all cylinders there , Rip .
HEAVY DUTY: All I know is , when the bass get 's that booty shaking in the right way , I 'm in the skin like a man named Flynn .
RIPCORD: Hell with it .
BREAKER: Into the Valley of Death rode the
RIPCORD: Beach reading , huh ? She groans and lowers the book only slightly .
SCARLETT: `` We 're attracted to one another . ''
RIPCORD: Thank you .
SCARLETT: That 's what you 're saying , not what I 'm saying .
RIPCORD: Okay , what are you saying ?
SCARLETT: Attraction is an emotion . Emotions are not based in science . And if you ca n't quantify or prove that something exists , well , in my mind it does n't .
RIPCORD: Okay , I 'll get back to you on that .
HAWK: Duke , You scored in the top half- percent of all people we 've eve tested . Rip , well , if we average your scores with Duke 's , you pass too . Welcome aboard , provisionally . But we still need to see if you pass muster in the field .
HEAVY DUTY: YO JOE ! Welcome aboard , boyz !
COVER GIRL: Sorry to disturb you , general .
HAWK: That 's all right , Cover Girl . What am I signing now ?
DUKE: The warheads .
RIPCORD: And you get out of thatthing .
ANA: Fine . Done . Then she takes a step toward Duke .
DUKE: Stop , Ana . Stop right there .
ANA: You ca n't shoot me , can you ?
DUKE: I will if I have to .
ANA: Deep down , you 're still the same man I fell in love with .
DUKE: Do n't force this , Ana .
ANA: What could have been , right , Duke ? You beside your best man . Me walking down the aisle .
RIPCORD: Do n't listen to her , Duke . Was I really going to be your best man ?
DUKE: Do n't make me do this god-damnit !
ANA: `` Do n't make me do this ? '' A ecurring theme in your life , right Duke ?
DUKE: Move and I 'll blow her away . Get the briefcase .
ANA: Do it , Duke . .You already killed me once .
CYNICAL: Hello brother .
SCARLETT: I believe you 've got my luggage .
PRESIDENT: How many warheads ?
STAFFER #1: Four , Mr. President .
PRESIDENT: Any threats ? Any demands ?
STAFFER #1: None so far , sir .
STAFFER #2: We take this to mean the terrorists are unfocused , no clear goals .
PRESIDENT: No , .it means they 're going to use them .
ANA: Why do you keep at it ? So that I MCCULLENne ver forget the most important rul e in dealing arms . Never sell to STORM SHADOWboth sides ?
MCCULLEN: Never get caught . McCullen carefully puts the mask back in its ca se .
CONT'D: Take the warheads N ( to them wea Paris . Have ized . Then to test pon one . I want you Test one ? ANA
MCCULLEN: I do n't wan t you until leaving Paris that they 've you ; re sure that the work , een properly y weaponized .
SMILES: We 'll let CNN show everyone how w ell they perform . I want them to fear me . It will be STORM SHADOWdone .
MCCULLEN: I have a target french will never in mind , one the forget .
THE DOCTOR: Are you ready , Mr. Zartan ?
ZARTAN: This is going to be the achievement of a lifetime .
THE DOCTOR: For you and me both .
ZARTAN: Eighteen months of studying the subject , learning the mannerisms , adopting his eating habits , losing sixty percent of my muscle mas
THE DOCTOR: Your commitment has been inspiring . McCullen enters .
MCCULLEN: Gentlemen . About to get under way ? Zartan raises his PDA .
ZARTAN: Once the ledgers are all square .
MCCULLEN: Check your account .
ZARTAN: It 's a useful tool . You should understand that . Ah ! The transfe just hit my account .
HARD MASTER: He is hungry . We need to invite him in and show him the way .
STORM SHADOW: He 's a cur ! A Frenchie !
HARD MASTER: He does n't fight like one . The two young warriors glare at one another .
RIPCORD: Jesus , you okay ?
SCARLETT: I 'm fine .
RIPCORD: You 're not fine , let me look at that .
SCARLETT: I looked at it , it 's fine .
RIPCORD: Take it easy , just trying to help .
SCARLETT: I know what you 're trying to do .
RIPCORD: And what is that exactly ?
SCARLETT: I do n't have time for this .
RIPCORD: You know , not every guy you meet is an asshole . You do know that , do n't you ?
SCARLETT: It 's not you , I I did n't really want anyone to see me in here .
RIPCORD: Why not ?
SCARLETT: I do n't know . All the people we lost last night . General Hawk My neck is not that important .
RIPCORD: You almost died . You 're allowed to e concerned .
SCARLETT: First fight I 've lost since I was a kid . My father would be he was my instructor .
RIPCORD: Think he 's be disappointed .
SCARLETT: He taught me to win .
RIPCORD: I do n't know how you teach anybody to win at everything every time .
SCARLETT: We 're not a couple . Snake-Eyes and me . We 're close , he 's like a other , but we 're not a couple .
HAWK: Can you kill her ?
PRELAP: That ought to hold you .
DUKE: Graveyard dead .
SCARLETT: Nano-mites . I wrote my thesis on the theory behind them at Oxford . They 've been surgically implanted ehind the ear , all programmed to accomplish different tasks .
DUKE: Like what ?
SCARLETT: Theoretically , the possibilities are endless . Increase their speed , agility , resilience . You program , they perform . That 's the genius of nanotechnology , it can do pretty much whatever you want it to .
DUKE: Mind control ?
SCARLETT: I do n't see why not .
DUKE: Their weaponry , financing , intel , it has to be McCullen . Doing an inside job on his own warheads .
SCARLETT: You may be right . Maybe he needed NATO to pay for his R D .
RIPCORD: The weapons case !
SCARLETT: What about it ?
RIPCORD: I 'll bet that code he gave us like e-activated the tracking beacon o something .
DUKE: And who says you 're not a thinker .
BREAKER: I think I found her
DUKE: Yeah , you found her all right .
BREAKER: Her name is Ana DeCobray now , Baroness if you 're feeling formal .
RIPCORD: Wow , she traded up , huh ? I mean financially .
DUKE: Who is he ?
BREAKER: Baron DeCobray . Big shot French scientist . Runs a lab in Paris .
SCARLETT: Lab ?
BREAKER: Particle accelerator .
SCARLETT: They 're gon na use him to weaponize the warheads .
DUKE: That 's where she 's going .
HEAVY DUTY: Who likes croissants ?
DUKE: Per the briefing , we fast rope in , form up and assault the main lab Rexuh , .the science officer , stays back with Fireteam Alpha until Bravo enters and secures the uilding . Alpha holds the perimete while science officer secures the WMDs . Five minutes before extraction and the airstrike . The squad nods .
REX: Yeah They chew their gum .
DUKE: Go , Bravo .
RIPCORD: I 've got ta level with ya !
DUKE: I hate it when you level with me .
RIPCORD: Gon na be a long five minutes .
DUKE: No , no , no It 's too soon .
RIPCORD: Blackhawk 's waiting . Come on , we 've got wounded ! And incoming enemy ! Lots of 'em !
DUKE: I ca n't .
RIPCORD: Nothing you can do . Come on !
SECURITY GUARD: Good Morning . Baroness .
ANA: Good morning . Gene . My husband 's expecting me .
SECURITY GUARD: Absolument .
DECOBRAY: Ana ?
ANA: I need you to do something for me and I do n't have much time .
DECOBRAY: Who is this ?
ANA: They 're warheads , dear . And I need you to weaponize them for me .or we 'll kill everyone in here .
DECOBRAY: This is a civilian laboratory . We do n't have the correct programming protocols for weaponizing
ANA: The protocols are in the case . I told you , I do n't have much time . DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case .
SCARLETT: Heavy D and Breaker will stay in the Brawler , watch our back . The est of us will break into the la with the accelerator suits . Once the warheads are weaponized , they 'll be extremely volatile . We ca n't afford to let any of them go off inside the city . Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes .
RIPCORD: What about you ? Do n't you get a suit ?
SCARLETT: He does n't need one .
DECOBRAY: Firing .
ANA: Thank you , Leon .
DECOBRAY: I think I have never seen the face of evil until I looked at you now .
ANA: Adieu .
HEAVY DUTY: There it is .
BREAKER: That 's them !
SCARLETT: Keep going !
BREAKER: Careful . They 're worth millions of dollars each .
RIPCORD: Millions of dollars , got it .
BREAKER: Christ , they just shot right through a bus !
RIPCORD: There 's no door !
BREAKER'S VOICE: Make one !
STORM SHADOW: Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy if I let you die .
ANA: How thoughtful .
SCARLETT: Look at the moves they 're making , they 're heading somewhere . Breaker widens the map , plotting a route .
BREAKER: This 's their route from the lab .
REALIZING: Metal Oh God
SCARLETT'S VOICE: Guys , you have to stop them .
DUKE: Yeah , we 're working on it .
SCARLETT'S VOICE: I mean right now . They 're going to detonate one of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower .
RIPCORD: Oh , man
CRINGING: You guys okay ?
DUKE: What happened to you ?
RIPCORD: I went through the train . What happened to you ?
DUKE: I jumped over it .
RIPCORD: You can do that ?
DUKE: Yeah , you did n't know ?
RIPCORD: How do you say `` we 're the good guys '' in French ?
SCARLETT: Do n't shoot ! We 're a special anti- terrorist unit ! There 's a bomb up there ! POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them .
RIPCORD: Where you going ?
DUKE: Each warhead has a kill switch .
RIPCORD: It 's too late ! We got ta get off this thing !
DUKE: Those nano-mites will level the entire city !
ANA: Be ready to pick up in thirty seconds .
BREAKER: Come on ! He hauls-ass .
ANA: You just saved Paris .
RIPCORD: What are you doing ?
BREAKER: Plugging into his cerebral cortex .
SCARLETT: The brain survives for a couple of minutes after death . We can read his most recent memories .
RIPCORD: Can you find Duke ?
BREAKER: If this guy remembers the way home we can .
MCCULLEN: Destroy that unit immediately .
HEAVY DUTY: He 's still alive !
SCARLETT: He 's not alive .
HEAVY DUTY: You ever seen a dead guy do that ?
SCARLETT: They activated a self-destruct .
BREAKER: Nano-mites !
RIPCORD: They 're eating him !
SCARLETT: Hurry , Breaker !
RIPCORD: You did the best you could .
BREAKER: Relax , I got it .
RIPCORD: You got it ?
CONFUSED: Well , what was the `` NOO ! '' for ?
BREAKER: That was for McCullen .
RIPCORD: We do n't have time for this .
HEAVY DUTY: Nice .
ARLETT: It'snot his emotional . fault . He 's just Scarlett and a French Detect Rip share a look . On the othe SUIT o curiously examines n a desk . Bre aker jumps up to Breakerssde Rf the bars the bars . Please , BREAKER touch that . Please , do n't
HE'S: touching It 's very Okayit . , Please ! Sir . Sir , How do RIPCORD you say `` lawyer '' in French ?
BREAKER: If we could get on a Might be to computer we longitude able Input the partial les g es latitude , and Viper , figu the downloaded from tha t e out their locati
HEAVY DUTY: It 'll be a military when they 're done tribunal . need a lawyer . We with us And 'll need diapers .
RIPCORD: Think , think , think At some point they got ta feed us o take us out for the interrogation . When they do I 'll jump the lead Guard . Heavy , you go for his weapon and
BREAKER: Start an international incident .
RIPCORD: I 'm not gon na just sit here !
BREAKER: This is bigger than Duke .
RIPCORD: What if it was one of you ? What if they had Heavy or Scarlett , what would you do ? The Joes trade looks - rock and a hard place .
SCARLETT: And we 'll do the same for him as soon as we get out of here . She has a thought and turns to Breaker .
BREAKER: We only got the one coordinate 90 degrees , then the image went to snow .
SCARLETT: Maybe it was the whole coordinate , just 90 degrees latitude .
RIPCORD: They did away with the guillotine , ight ?
BREAKER: General ! Hawk just shakes his head and sighs heavily .
HEAVY DUTY: How long before we 're released ?
HAWK: The French government is allowing you to leave on the condition that none of you ever return . Othe agencies will be handling this from here on .
RIPCORD: That 's it ? They 've got Duke !
HAWK: I said you were to report to Washington . I did n't say when , o which route to take .
SCARLETT: Maybe a northern one . Hawk smiles and wheels out the door .
ANA: He thinks I should kill you .
DUKE: Why do n't you ?
ANA: James wants to meet you in person .
DUKE: James ?
ANA: Mr McCullen .
DUKE: Ana listen
ANA: Talk softly , or he 'll tazer you again .
DUKE: Loosen these , he 'll never tase anything again . She taps the bonds on his wrists .
ANA: I should 've thought of this before . They almost share a smile .
DUKE: Let me get this straight . You 're with McCullen . You 're married to that Baron . And you claim you 're still in love with me .
ANA: I 'm a complex woman .
DUKE: Maybe you just do n't know who you are anymore .
ANA: Who I was died long ago .
DUKE: No , this is n't you , I still see the person I loved behind your eyes . Her eyes soften for a moment .
ANA: Tell me what she was like .
DUKE: She was smart , and funny . She was loyal as hell . She loved those she was close with , me , her brother I did my best . With Rex . I 'm sorry . He was my responsibility . I should have It 's why I left , Ana . Why I could n't be with you . You were in so much pain I thought the sight of me just give you more .
ANA: It does n't matter now .
DUKE: No , it matters very much . We have the chance to make things right .
ANA: Nothing will ever be right again .
STORM SHADOW: And what was your plan ? Run three thousand miles across the ice ?
HEAVY DUTY: That 's a lotta ice .
RIPCORD: It 's gon na be like trying to find whale spit in the ocean .
BREAKER: That 's strange .
SCARLETT: What ?
BREAKER: When they stole the weapons case , I set my suit to scan for the tracke eacon in case it came back on , and it just came back on . Ripcord just smiles .
RIPCORD: That 's my boy .
ANA: Certain work needs to be done away from the public eye .
MCCULLEN: Take them to the drones . I want them ready to launch in one hour .
STORM SHADOW: It will be done . And only then does McCullen greet Ana .
MCCULLEN: My beautiful Lady of the Lake
DUKE: I 'm already happy .
MCCULLEN: You take to your training well , that 's good . Still trying to develop information . Still planning to escape and stope me . Moments from now , you 'll see that wo n't ever happen .
DUKE: Then you wo n't mind telling me .
MCCULLEN: Is n't it clear ? I 'm a business man . I 'm going to use them .
DUKE: Millions of people are gon na die if you launch those warheads . What is it you want , McCullen ?
MCCULLEN: Merely to strike fear into the hearts of every man , woman , and child on the planet . Only then will they look up to the man who wields the most power , and obey him .
THE DOCTOR: My genius lies only in taking what others created to the logical next steps . All modern gains in science are made through theft .
MCCULLEN: You 'll have to excuse his modesty , when I found him , he was
THE DOCTOR: Another `` recruit '' ?
MCCULLEN: Albeit a rather unwilling one . The Doctor 's nano-mites can control all manner of brain functions . When you wake up , you 'll be working for me , and your past will be a distant shimmer that floats in and out of your mind like a leaf on a breeze .
THE DOCTOR: I 'll prepare him for the surgery .
SCARLETT: It 's an underwater facility
HEAVY DUTY: McCullen 's home away from home .
RIPCORD: Dukes ' got ta be in there somewhere .
SCARLETT: Wait , what 's that ?
BREAKER: Oh , JesusThat 's an automated , phased array turbo-pulse battery . A really big gun .
SCARLETT: Could it take out our sub ?
BREAKER: That thing could take out a dozen subs simultaneously .
SCARLETT: Then that 's our first objective .
RIPCORD: No , no . Duke 's our first objective .
SCARLETT: The main force ca n't attack as long as that cannon 's online .
HEAVY DUTY: How you figure getting it offline ?
SCARLETT: Elevator cables . They 've got a surface entrance . Shipwreck ?
SHIPWRECK: Going up , senorita ?
SCARLETT: Snake-Eyes , Breaker , Ripcord , and I will infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon . Heavy D , as soon as we give the word , you lead the assault from outside .
HEAVY DUTY: Go , Joes
TECHNICIAN: All drones prepared and ready , Sir .
MCCULLEN: Good , commence the launch sequence immediately .
RIPCORD: That McCullen 's got some gadgets .
BREAKER: Maybe we could slide down . Snake-Eyes shakes his head , doubtful
SCARLETT: The arctic water would kill us .
TECHNICIAN: Three two one ignite primary engines .
MCCULLEN: Lost one ? What do you mean ?
TECHNICIAN: Bird Three is down , Sir .
STORM SHADOW: We 're under attack .
MCCULLEN: Alert all defences . Charge up the pulse cannon .
BREAKER: What about the other two ?
RIPCORD: We find the kill switches and short out the nano-mites .
BREAKER: They 're already way out of range .
SCARLETT: Then somebody has to go up there and shoot those things down .
PAUSE: That 's me .
SCARLETT: Can you even fly this thing ?
RIPCORD: I can fly anything . You just track those warheads and guide me in . We do n't have long until they hit .
SCARLETT: Ripcord ?
RIPCORD: Do me a favor ? Save Duke .
THE DOCTOR: The atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city . Seventy percent Did you know that , Duke ?
REX: There was a bank situated less than one hundred yards from Ground Zero , destroyed of course . Only one thing survived . It 's four bank vaults . And when those vaults were opened , they discovered everything inside them had survived completely unscathed .
DUKE: Who are you ?
THE DOCTOR: Of course , the vault I took shelte in was n't that well-made .
DUKE: Rex
THE DOCTOR: A moving ceremony , I 'm sure . The three volley salute . The flag on the coffin .
DUKE: Why ? .Why did n't you come in ?
THE DOCTOR: Because I found out the truth
BRAVE SOLDIER: Intel says the lab 's in the asement .
SCIENTIST: Are you going to shoot me ? Rex does n't respond .
REX: Stay where you are .
SCIENTIST: No . Something much better .
RES: This is beyond anything This is light years ahead of anyone in the field .
SCIENTIST: You see why I could n't leave .
THE DOCTOR: The man who created this technology was not our enemy . In fact , he was hired by our very own government to create it . When it was deemed too unethical , they sent us to kill him . He did n't survive the blast . But I lived . And I escaped with his research . Unfortunately I tested it on myself first , and lost my lungs and vocal chords in the process . But now I 've perfected it , and you will get a first-hand experience .
DUKE: Does Ana know about this , about you ?
THE DOCTOR: No and she never will .
DUKE: You sick bastard you did this to your own sister ?
INCENSED: I loved my sister ! Do you have any idea the state she was in ? Me dead . You AWOL . Depression , drugs .
DUKE: Why work for McCullen ?
THE DOCTOR: He saved my life , for starters . Now to mention infinite resources to work in the field of my choosing .
DUKE: That 's bullshit . You could have had any job you wanted .
THE DOCTOR: I did n't want any job . You ca n't play nice with science , Duke . It 's sometimes necessary to experiment , to fail , even to destroy to attain a goal . It 's a fact that McCullen has the guts to embrace .
DUKE: Everything she 's done , everything she 's become , started because she thought you died that day .
THE DOCTOR: And because you then abandoned her , let 's not forget that part .
SCARLETT: It 's pressure plated and lase protected . Anyway around it ?
BREAKER: No . Any object larger than a quarter will fry your britches .
ANA: I do n't have much time .
DUKE: Ana !
HEAVY DUTY: Let 's get in this fight .
BREAKER: Okay , I 've got a lock on the two emaining warheads . Target one is Moscow ! Target Two is Washington !
SCARLETT: Give Ripcord the coordinates .
SHIPWRECK: The hull 's been ruptured !
HEAVY DUTY: Everyone into the attack boats !
MCCULLEN: Is she still alive ?
THE DOCTOR: For now .
MCCULLEN: You said this could n't happen .
THE DOCTOR: I did n't think it could . I 've neve seen anyone defeat the programming , even momentarily .
DUKE: Put it down .
THE DOCTOR: Your choice , Duke .
DUKE: Put it down !
RIPCORD: I see it , dead ahead .
BREAKER: You have to knock it down before it e-enters the atmosphere so the nano-mites do n't reach the ground .
RIPCORD: Uh , I 've got a problem . The fire controls are not in here .
BREAKER'S VOICE: What do you mean , not in there ?
RIPCORD: I mean I ca n't see them anywhere !
SCARLETT: It 's got ta be voice-activated .
RIPCORD'S VOICE: What ?
SCARLETT: You have to say the words into you flight helmet .
RIPCORD: Fire ! Shoot ! Blast away !
RIPCORD'S VOICE: Nothing 's happening !
BREAKER: Must be a different language .
SCARLETT: Try `` teine '' .
RIPCORD'S VOICE: What ?
SCARLETT: It 's Scottish for fire .
RIPCORD: Teine .
SCARLETT: Listen to my voice , `` Teine '' .
RIPCORD: Teine ! Teine ! Teine ! It 's not working !
SCARLETT'S VOICE: That 's because you 're not saying it ight !
RIPCORD: How many different ways you want me to say it ?
SCARLETT'S VOICE: One way ! The right way ! Teine !
RIPCORD: Teine !
BREAKER: Nice work , Ace . You just saved Moscow .
RIPCORD: Just doing my job . Guide me to the other drone
PRESIDENT: How soon will it strike the city ?
STAFFER: Seventeen minutes , Sir .
PRESIDENT: This will be a disaster the likes of which we have never seen .
SHIPWRECK: That cannon 's going to kill us all .
HEAVY DUTY: My guy will take care of it , trust me .
STAFFER: It seems somebody 's shot down the warhead heading for Moscow .
PRESIDENT: Thank God
RIPCORD: Second drone in my sights .
BREAKER: Hurry , Rip . You 've only got thirty seconds before it enters the lowe atmosphere .
RIPCORD: Taine !
SCARLETT'S VOICE: Teine ! Teine !
RIPCORD: Do n't yell at me !
SCARLETT'S VOICE: Teine .
RIPCORD: Teine !
BREAKER: You missed ! The warhead has entered the lower atmosphere !
MCCULLEN: Did you think she loved you ?
DUKE: Stay back !
MCCULLEN: Did you imagine your life with her ?
DUKE: I said stay back !
THE DOCTOR: Do n't you know you 've lost , Duke ?
DUKE: All I know is that neither of you deserves her .
BREAKER: You 're too close , Rip . Back up .
RIPCORD: Actually , I think I 'm just about close enough
PAUSE: .teine .
SCARLETT: Ripcord ? What happened ? Rip !
BREAKER: He 's taking the nano-mites back up into the upper atmosphere .
RIPCORD: Cur magh !
BREAKER: He did it He actually did it
SCARLETT: Ripcord ? Talk to meRipcord !
RIPCORD'S VOICE: I asked you not to yell at me .
SCARLETT: What happened ? Are you okay ?
RIPCORD'S VOICE: Yeah , did it work ?
SCARLETT: Yesyes , it worked .
RIPCORD: Goodcause I think I 'm about to get arrested .
NINJA #1: That 's Storm Shadow 's sword !
NINJA #2: There ! There 's the murderer !
STORM SHADOW: You took your vow of silence to avenge our Master . But now you will die without a word .
HEAVY DUTY: Turbo-laser is down !
BREAKER: Energy overload in the phased array attery . Power subsystems are going critical .
SCARLETT: Let 's get out of here !
HEAVY DUTY: We got a runner ! Cut him off !
SHIPWRECK: All other targets neutralized .
MCCULLEN: I guess I should thank you , Doctor .
THE DOCTOR: I want you to call me Commander . And from now on , I 'll be on a first name basis with you , Destro . McCullen 's silver face goes blank .
MCCULLEN: Yes , Commander .
SCIENTIST: Physically , she 's fine . But without the correctly-coded kill frequency , we ca n't short them out .
DUKE: There 's nothing you can do ?
SCIENTIST: Only the man who put them in there has the correct code .
DUKE: I 'll visit you .
ANA: I wo n't be here long .
DUKE: You 'll be here for the rest of you life , Ana . She looks at him , her face softening .
ANA: Duke ?
DUKE: I 'm here .
ANA: After all I 've done , .you ca n't save me , .it 's too late . A BEAT passes between them .
DUKE: I 'll visit you .
ANA: You know , this has only just begun .
HAWK: With GI JOE reinstated , would you oys like to stay on awhile ?
DUKE: What do you say , Rip ?
RIPCORD: I 'm good . They all laugh . Rip steps up to her .
SCARLETT: I feel very emotional .
NICKY: I used to drive a taxi .
DRIVER: Where you 're going , mister ?
NICKY: I used to drive a taxi .
DRIVER: I used to be head of neurosurgery . Big hospital in USSR . This hospital , I 'm not kidding .
NICKY: Very big .
DRIVER: I opened thousands of brains .
NICKY: What did you find ?
DRIVER: Big mess every time .
NICKY: I loved my taxi . Went twelve hours nonstop . Stopped only to pee . I peed under the Manhattan bridge . Peed many times in parks and playgrounds .
JOANNA: Last night . Alan Albright called me a handsome woman . Second time he 's done that . Son of a bitch .
NICKY: I hear Alan 's sick .
JOANNA: Alan 's very sick . He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution .
NICKY: You know about Adele .
JOANNA: What about her ?
NICKY: She 's dying .
JOANNA: She died .
NICKY: I talked to her two days ago .
JOANNA: Apparently it did n't help . You know about Peter , of course .
NICKY: Our Peter ?
JOANNA: Peter Redmond . They found out why he ca n't remember his lines . There 's something living in his ain . A parasite he picked up in Borneo , doing the movie .
NICKY: Can he get through it ?
JOANNA: They 're watching him closely . There 's a special rehearsal set fo this afternoon . To bolster his confidence . And that 's not all .
NICKY: I 've got bigger problems , Joanna . Personal problems .
JOANNA: That 's not all , Nicky . I 've been acking your plays for fifteen years . And I 've never been more depressed .
NICKY: About what ?
JOANNA: S teven Schwimmer . The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan .
NICKY: Look . All I want is a haircut . I 'm not worried about this guy .
JOANNA: Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater , nobody in this usiness has been worried about anything else .
NICKY: They can send their heartless illiant boy-critic . There 's a much bigger thing going on than tonight 's opening .
JOANNA: What ?
NICKY: The Red Sox
JOANNA: You mean the World Series ? I thought the Red Sox were winning .
NICKY: Three games to two . But if you know their history , you realize there 's a tragedy in the making . I 've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old .
JOANNA: It ca n't be all that personal .
NICKY: If you have a team you 've followed all your life , and they raise you hopes and crush them , and lift them and crush them , do you want me to tell you what it 's like ? It 's like feeling your childhood die over and over . J
JOANNA: I mean Nicky , really , no .
NICKY: This is how we 've managed to last .
JOANNA: We 're able to surprise each other .
NICKY: In and out of bed .
JOANNA: Because we 're completely mismatched .
NICKY: We do n't even like each other , do we ?
JOANNA: I used to tell myself . Talent is more erotic when it 's wasted . Will I see you tonight ?
NICKY: The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918 . You expect me to miss that for an opening night ?
JOANNA: It makes me so mad . Steven Schwimmer ready to strike . The exterminating angel .
NICKY: It 's all worked out . They 'll lose tonight . Then they 'll lose tomorrow . I see it with stunning clarity .
JOANNA: It 's your best play , Nicky .
NICKY: They 'll lose because they 're my team .
JOANNA: He will absolutely hate it .
NICKY: I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil . I ate and drove . I had one of those ig checkered cabs .
DRIVER: You are going where ?
NICKY: Crosstown .
DRIVER: Very bad today .
NICKY: I cleaned out the ashtrays eligiously .
DRIVER: I am sitting here five years in traffic . It is one continuous traffic since I arrive . Why must it e ?
NICKY: Laurel , stay there . Keep the meter running . And try to stay abreast .
LAUREL: I go to college . I thought you knew .
NICKY: Do you want to get some coffee ?
LAUREL: I do n't drink coffee , Daddy . And this is not what we should be talking about .
NICKY: What do you want to talk about ? I 'll talk about anything . What 's this ?
LAUREL: I 'm seeing your play tonight , emember ?
NICKY: Why do you need a radio ?
LAUREL: So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game . Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer ?
NICKY: That 's completely crazy .
LAUREL: Is it ?
NICKY: Do n't talk like that . How prominent ? What are you implying ?
LAUREL: She 's doing like those Iranians . ` I divorce thee . I divorce thee . I divorce thee '
NICKY: And he hears it the same time I hear it ? What happened to family secrets ?
LAUREL: Mother is totally , you know , upset .
NICKY: Abulhassas , we 'll be getting out here .
GEORGE: Nicky , you do n't come in for a while . Everything 's okay ?
NICKY: Hello George . You 're so healthy and thick-bodied I want to punch you in the chest . This is my daughte Laurel . Just to hear the sound it makes .
GEORGE: I saw your picture in the paper . Two papers .
NICKY: That means they 're getting ready to kill me .
GEORGE: That 's not what I hear . I have four , five actors working here . ` His best play since `` Yessiree Bob '' I 'm telling you , they say it .
LAUREL: He does n't want to hear it .
NICKY: If lawyers for the mob are called controversial , why are divorce lawyers called prominent ?
LAUREL: Because they get outstanding settlements . And Mother is determined that this time there 's no turning back .
NICKY: I just had breakfast with her . She did n't say a word about this .
LAUREL: Because you refuse to believe she 's serious . You 've always refused .
NICKY: Do n't be so steely-eyed . It 's that course you 're taking in criminology .
LAUREL: Oh please . Not now . She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name . Finally . Now and forever . Do you think that 's too much to ask ? For a wife of nineteen years .
NICKY: You 're too young to be studying criminal behavior . It 's making you obsessive .
LAUREL: She is kicking you out .
NICKY: Your mother and I have something etween us that 's too strong to damage permanently . Believe me , I know this . That 's right , nineteen years . And what about the days and minutes ? Sharing small moments , sharing memories , raising a eautiful child . We 're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways . Lillian is n't only my wife . She 's my best friend .
LAUREL: Bullshit , Daddy .
NICKY: Do n't call her Mother all the time . It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving . What happened to Mom ?
LAUREL: I did n't turn her into Mother . You did .
NICKY: This person and I are a thing of the total past . I promise you .
LAUREL: Know what Mother said to me ? Daddy 's demons are so intense he does n't even know he 's lying .
NICKY: It 's life , it 's taxis . People trying to make contacts , make deals , meet their lovers . Taxis are sexy . You ca n't have Manhattan without taxis . I was proud of my taxi . I kept my taxi clean .
ELLIOT: Nicky . I was thinking about you . I went to the preview last night .
NICKY: I do n't want to hear about it .
ELLIOT: A lovely piece of theater . Small ut important .
NICKY: Shut up , Elliot .
ELLIOT: Quietly effective .
NICKY: You 're an artist . I 'm a craftsman .
ELLIOT: Press a button and they give us money .
NICKY: Ride with me . We need a haircut .
ELLIOT: How is Lillian ? I have n't seen her .
NICKY: She wants a divorce .
ELLIOT: Do n't talk like that .
NICKY: It 's over , finished and done with .
ELLIOT: That sounds so final . But are we eally surprised ?
NICKY: I 'm completely stunned . I do n't want this to happen .
ELLIOT: But did n't we know it would happen ?
NICKY: Do n't needle me , Elliot . Tell me how bad you feel . We 're suppose to feel bad together . This is what friends do .
ELLIOT: Joanna Bourne . So rich and crisp . This woman lets you touch her body ? You put your hands on her personal parts ?
DRIVER: We must abandon .
NICKY: What do you mean , we must abandon ?
DRIVER: Ruptured steam pipe .
ELLIOT: Ruptured steam pipe .
DRIVER: Asbestos lining . Do not inhale .
NICKY: We must abandon .
DRIVER: Contaminated substance . Very dangerous . Shooting mud .
NICKY: Do not inhale .
ELLIOT: We must abandon .
DRIVER: Ruptured steam pipe .
NICKY: Very dangerous .
ELLIOT: Asbestos lining .
NICKY: We must abandon .
ELLIOT: Do not inhale .
NICKY: I 'm trying to think . When did you start looking so terrible ? You look awful .
ELLIOT: I can tell you the year , the day , the night , the minute .
NICKY: You used to love life . You do n't exude this any more .
ELLIOT: What do I exude ?
NICKY: Suffering . You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread .
ELLIOT: Tonight you find out what it means to suffer .
NICKY: Tonight . What 's tonight ?
ELLIOT: Shit . They do n't have any carrot soup .
NICKY: You mean because What's-His-Name .
ELLIOT: You will suffer because he is in the theater . And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears .
NICKY: It 's just a review .
ELLIOT: It is just a review . Do not inhale . Very dangerous .
NICKY: What 's the fuss ? I do n't get it .
ELLIOT: That 's what I said eighteen months ago .
NICKY: What happened eighteen months ago ?
ELLIOT: Before his Broadway days . He eviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market . We did this play at four AM , outdoors in the ain . One performance . For the fish handlers .
NICKY: And he was there ?
ELLIOT: Steven Schwimmer . I memorized every word of this review .
NICKY: That 's awful .
ELLIOT: I recite it to myself with masochistic relish .
NICKY: A year and a half later ? You 're still brooding ?
MAN: Yessirree Bob ! Yessisree Bob !
ELLIOT: You do n't know about obscure writers , Nicky . How we have ou anger to nurture and love . Ou murderous fantasies for any amount of fame , money , power and sex .
PAISLEY: Guys ready to order ?
ELLIOT: Paisley Porter . I did n't know you were waiting tables .
PAISLEY: Elliot ?
ELLIOT: This is a great young out-of-work actress .
AISLEY: Elliot Litvak . Have you been ill ? And Mr. Rogan . How nice .
NICKY: What 's good ?
PAISLEY: We have a very nice pasta today . Alla Putanesca .
ELLIOT: Say it again .
PAISLEY: Alla puttanesca .
ELLIOT: Is n't she great ? What did I tell you ? A talent .
FIRST MAN: I got a good feeling about tonight
SECOND MAN: We got Ojeda going . He pitched eautiful last time out .
FIRST MAN: Plus Darryl 's due for a big game .
NICKY: I hate the Mets .
SECOND MAN: How come ?
NICKY: When the Mets lose , they just lose . It 's a flat feeling . But the Red Sox here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game . Defeats that keep you awake , that pound in your head like the hammer of fate .
ELLIOT: ` One thing saves Elliot Litvak 's work from complete mediocrity , and this is his lack of ambition . '
WAITER: It gets funnier .
ELLIOT: It gets funnier . See , Nicky ? They chart the laughs . This from a critic who lives like a fallen monk . Whose address is a carefully guarded secret .
WAITER: A critic who has to disguise himself .
NICKY: What do you mean ?
WAITER: To go to the theater . Wears I do n't know what . Make-up , padding .
NICKY: Why ?
WAITER: Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business .
ELLIOT: He has to disguise himself , Nicky .
WAITER: For his own safety and peace of mind .
ELLIOT: Do you want me to tell you what it was like , reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca ?
NICKY: What was it like ?
ELLIOT: I said , ` I 'm dead ' . He killed me .
NICKY: You 've worked with Elliot ?
PAISLEY: I was in the fish-market play . What happened to him ?
NICKY: There was a review .
PAISLEY: I think I remember .
NICKY: So does Elliot .
PAISLEY: Not one of Steven 's finer moments .
NICKY: Oh . You know him .
PAISLEY: A little .
NICKY: And he has finer moments now and then .
PAISLEY: He has something . A funny little quality I find
NICKY: Endearing .
PAISLEY: Engaging .
NICKY: Elliot wants to kill him with a ailroad spike .
PAISLEY: A little drastic maybe ?
NICKY: Say it again .
PAISLEY: What ?
NICKY: You know what .
PAISLEY: Alla puttanesca .
NICKY: One more time .
ELLIOT: Is it safe ?
NICKY: Do we care ?
ELLIOT: I think we Nought to wait .
NICKY: I say we go .
ELLIOT: You say we go ?
NICKY: Do not inhale .
ELLIOT: I 'm not ready .
NICKY: Here we go .
ELLIOT: The man has taken over my mind . He 's not only out there . He 's in my head and I ca n't get rid of him . I ca n't write a word without imagining his response . I 'm paralyzed as an artist .
NICKY: I do n't have the problems that artists have .
LLIOT: You 've been saying that for years .
NICKY: What ?
ELLIOT: ` I 'm just a professional . A dues- playing member of a guild . ' Because you 're afraid , Nicky . That 's the darkest part of you . You do n't think you 're good enough .
ELLIOT: Where are you going ?
NICKY: Do n't wait Efor me .
ELLIOT: What about the haircut ?
NICKY: You keep slipping away . How do you do that ?
PAISLEY: I was one of those silent , listening children . Glued to the shadows .
NICKY: I was all noise . Played the radio loud . Battled constantly with my other and sister . Here I am , world .
PAISLEY: I hear good things about the new play .
NICKY: So do I . Over and over .
PAISLEY: Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously .
NICKY: Would you like to meet him ?
PAISLEY: He does n't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue .
NICKY: I 'm trying to prolong ou afternoon . In case you have n't noticed .
AISLEY: The fact is , I have to get going .
NICKY: Is it true ?
PAISLEY: Is what true ?
NICKY: He wears a disguise .
PAISLEY: Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy . No friends . No phone .
NICKY: But you 're his friend .
PAISLEY: Sort of . Sometimes . You 're not uilding an obsession about Steven , are you ? Look . I understand opening- night jitters , but you 've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play .
RENEE: I ca n't take this anymore . He forgets simple lines . He forgets where to stand . We tell him and tell him and tell him . I know he 's a sweet man . I love Peter . It 's not his fault . But I 've never worked in a show where the leading man has 4 parasites in his brain .
NICKY: aybe we ought to postpone the opening .
SIDNEY: Joanna loves this play . She has sunk tons of money . She is completely Ncommitted .
NICKY: appreciate that , Sidney . But ou leading man ca n't remember his lines . And his understudy ca n't carry the play .
SIDNEY: I had lunch with Joanna . She said she told you about Peter . You were n't concerned , she said .
NICKY: hat was this morning .
SIDNEY: So what happened since ? You 're worried about this kid who writes these reviews ?
NICKY: 'm not worried about this kid .
SIDNEY: Well I am . Worried sick . Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer . He 's here to announce the death of civilization . He kills a play every time he farts .
NICKY: Postpone . We have every right .
SIDNEY: Too late . All the elements are in place . Delay the opening and we lose the theater .
NICKY: I 've had three straight washouts , Sidney .
SIDNEY: You 're dangling from the last letter of your last name .
NICKY: Sidney remains optimistic .
PETER: Sidney .
NICKY: Sidney Fabrikant . Our producer .
PETER: I was educated by nuns .
NICKY: Y es .
PETER: I have excellent long-term memory .
NICKY: Yes .
PETER: I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth .
NICKY: Yes , Peter .
PETER: But my parasite is consuming all the new memories . Eating my lines .
NICKY: You have to see the words . Try to uild a mental picture of the script . Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen .
PETER: What color ?
NICKY: What was your favorite colo crayon , growing up ?
PETER: Burnt sienna .
NICKY: Mine was cobalt blue .
PETER: This is your history , is n't it ? Nicky ? All around us . And my parasite is consuming it .
NICKY: Yes .
PETER: I kissed her while she was laughing .
NICKY: Yes .
PETER: I can see her face so clearly . Dea God . My heart was flying out of my chest with love .
RENEE: I hear he got the parasite in Burma .
JACK: I heard Borneo .
RENEE: Why do we blame the Third World fo our parasites ? Maybe he got it in Denver or Minneapolis .
JACK: Maybe he got it in Borneo .
PETER: I feel shaky about one line in particular . If I can get past this line . I think I can handle the last long speech .
RENEE: Which line , Peter ?
PETER: The Son says to the Father , This could be it .
NICKY: And the Father replies ?
PETER: That 's the line I ca n't ever , fo the life of me remember . I just ca n't get it .
JACK: It 's the same line . The Fathe simply repeats what the Son says to him .
RENEE: This could be it .
NICKY: This could be it .
PETER: I know it sounds easy . But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I 'm suppose to Jrepeat it .
ACK: This could be it .
PETER: This could be it .
JACK: Let 's work on it .
PETER: Let 's work on it .
AISLEY: Do you think he can do it ?
NICKY: I do n't know .
PAISLEY: He 's a very sweet man .
NICKY: Where are you going now ?
PAISLEY: Home .
NICKY: Someone waiting for you ?
PAISLEY: No one 's waiting .
NICKY: There 's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid . Is that our Steven ?
PAISLEY: If I 'm sleeping with him , and I have n't said I am , then so what ?
NICKY: So everything . That 's so what . So I egin to hate him . So I want to do him grave harm .
PAISLEY: But you do n't even know me . How can you care what I do with whom ?
NICKY: I know you both . Enough . How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy .
PAISLEY: Do you want to talk about doing crazy things .
NICKY: Yes .
PAISLEY: Never mind .
NICKY: What ? Come on , Paisley .
PAISLEY: Our Steven not only disguises himself .
NICKY: Yes .
PAISLEY: He goes to the theater armed .
NICKY: I 'm actually beginning to enjoy this .
STEVEN: You 've come to me . I wanted to elieve you would one day .
PAISLEY: I have n't come to you .
STEVEN: But you 're here . So you must have come to me .
PAISLEY: In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you 've been causing with your reviews . Steven , it 's so unfair .
STEVEN: Of course it 's unfair . The truth is always unfair . Why do you think I live this way ? Hiding out . Stealing electricity from a lamp post . Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society . I ca n't live openly , in a nice clean doorman building , with my name on the mailbox . They 'd come after me in packs .
PAISLEY: Not if you stopped hurting people . Write the truth gently .
STEVEN: The truth is never gentle . Listen to me carefully . Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams . Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin . It hurts and maims .
PAISLEY: Yes . I 've seen your victims . One past and one future . I thought I might convince you to reconsider .
STEVEN: And I thought , at last , she 's here , she wants me .
PAISLEY: I do n't want you , Steven .
TEVEN: Stay . Teach me to be compassionate .
PAISLEY: I 'm going home to my machine .
SIDEWALKS: The new Nicky ogan
NICKY: Laurel . Tickets are all set . I double-checked .
LAUREL: Thanks , Daddy . But I just need one . Mother 's not going .
NICKY: Opening night ?
LAUREL: I know why should a bitte divorce interfere with tradition ?
NICKY: Take it yourself . Take a date .
AUREL: I do n't have a date . I do n't want a date .
NICKY: And you blame me . It 's because we never talk . Let 's talk .
LAUREL: I have a class . I 'm late .
NICKY: Can we talk later ? Will you be at the party ?
LAUREL: I 'm not sure .
NICKY: I 'll find you . After the show . Somewhere .
DRIVER: A man is hit the other day by another taxi . I mean he is flying . Crash against the windscreen . Right here in my face . Blood is everywhere .
NICKY: I never left the garage without my Windex .
DRIVER: I was barrister in Kenya . I said to him , get off from here . I can not drive with your body on my windscreen .
NICKY: I drove twelve hours straight through . Ate at the wheel .
RIVER: You have to eat at the wheel . You can not get anywhere .
NICKY: That 's the drama . We 're waiting fo life to continue . Where do you pee , Ibrahmin ?
DRIVER: Under the Manhattan Bridge .
NICKY: That 's where I peed .
MICHAEL: Who is it ?
NICKY: It 's me . Nicky .
MICHAEL: Nicky comes on Sunday 's .
NICKY: Where are your glasses ? Go get them .
MICHAEL: If it 's you , what are you doing here ?
NICKY: I 'm on my way to get a haircut .
ICHAEL: Where does Nicky get his hair cut ?
NICKY: Across Ninth Avenue . Dodgie 's . Where you 've been getting your hai cut for fifty years . Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got thei hair cut . Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker .
MICHAEL: It was rummy , not poker . But I 'll take a chance and let you in .
NICKY: It 's a constant shock to me , how small this place is . How did we do it ? Five people in these little ooms .
MICHAEL: Get yourself something to eat .
NICKY: We must have been heroic .
MICHAEL: Five 's not so many . There were families with seven kids . A grandmother . A dimwit uncle .
NICKY: Lillian says it once a week . ` Why does n't he come live with us ? '
MICHAEL: You know the answer to that .
NICKY: I do know the answer to that . Why do n't we watch the ball game later ? We 'll go to Mannion 's .
MICHAEL: They 're only gon na lose .
NICKY: Of course they 're gon na lose . We 'll watch them lose . What good is heartbreak if we do n't experience it firsthand ?
MICHAEL: The Red Sox are your problem . I never understood about you and the Red Sox . Everybody rooted for the Yankees .
NICKY: Remember 1949 ? Last two games of the season . Against the Yankees . The Sox lost on Saturday . Then they lost on Sunday . First I cried fo twenty-four hours . Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week .
MICHAEL: It 's one thing for kids . You get older , you Nhave other things .
NICKY: It 's all connected , Pop . It 's one life . Baseball is memory . How do fathers and sons show their love ? They go to a ball game together . Thirty-five years later , they sit in the kitchen and remember .
MICHAEL: But the son is suppose to stop crying .
NICKY: I could have grown up happy . A Yankee fan . A divorce lawyer .
MICHAEL: Do n't make me sit through one of your plays .
NICKY: Hey , Pop . I know you do n't like the commotion of opening night . But I especially want you to see this play . It 's new territory for me . And for you too . I have to know what you think .
MICHAEL: Since when did that matter ?
NICKY: Let 's not start that again .
MICHAEL: My back is killing me .
NICKY: Where 's your elastic brace ?
MICHAEL: I ca n't find it .
NICKY: You 're suppose to wear it when you ack gives you trouble .
MICHAEL: I lost it . I lose everything .
NICKY: I 'll go get you another one . You have to wear it .
MICHAEL: So I know who I 'm letting in .
NICKY: I know , Pop .
MICHAEL: I 'm lucky they do n't knock down the uilding . It could happen anytime . And everything worth remembering is ight here .
NICKY: I think the building 's okay . At least for the time being .
MICHAEL: You did n't think it was okay when you lived here . You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were unning a marathon .
NICKY: Normal boy 's ambition . I like coming back . You know that .
MICHAEL: You tell your friends your fathe used to work the docks . Callused hands . But you had an attitude when you were growing up that was n't easy for your mother and me to understand .
NICKY: I was in a hurry to do big things , make big mistakes . Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big . But I 'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly . That 's the play they 're going to kill starting tonight . There 's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart . And that 's us . Who we were and where we come from .
MICHAEL: So what are you going to do about it ?
NICKY: What do you want me to do ?
MICHAEL: Show him who we are .
NICKY: He carries a gun .
ELLIOT: Then you should carry a gun .
NICKY: I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab .
ELLIOT: Where is it ?
NICKY: I gave it away . I thought , I 'm a writer now .
ELLIOT: That was a big mistake .
DODGIE: You should never be without a gun . In this city ?
ELLIOT: If he carries a gun , you have to carry a gun .
NICKY: We 're making too much of this .
ELLIOT: No , we 're not .
NICKY: I 'm not a lonely spooky writer like you . Nursing a hundred grudges . I 'm a man who loves life .
ELLIOT: We 're talking about something deeper than grudges . How do we espond to personal attack ?
DODGIE: In this city ? And you do n't carry a gun ?
ELLIOT: How do we maintain our dignity and self-respect ?
NICKY: In other words why should we suffe silently at this kind of abuse ? The man is out there ruining lives .
ELLIOT: It 's your best play , Nicky .
NICKY: He 'll hate it .
ELLIOT: He 'll kill it . He 'll write a review so devastating it will shatter you career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief . What happens to your apartment on the East River ? Your house in Connecticut , where you watch things grow .
NICKY: We were thinking of putting in a pool .
ELLIOT: ` The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks fuzzy , grubby and shifty-eyed . ' I 'm telling you as a friend .
NICKY: What ?
ELLIOT: There are things that speak to us from the past .
DODGIE: In this city you do n't walk five feet out the door and there is somebody trying to take what 's yours .
ELLIOT: Your truth is locked in your past . Find it . Know it for what it is . Shoot him , Nicky .
NICKY: Shoot him .
ELLIOT: The American theater does n't need people like that .
NICKY: Shoot him , Nicky . Not that we eally mean it . But where does he live ?
ELLIOT: Keep going west . Last building efore the river .
NICKY: How do you Eknow .
LLIOT: Paisley Porter .
NICKY: What do you mean ?
ELLIOT: About an hour and a half ago . I saw her come out of a place . She said she was visiting a friend . But she would n't tell me who .
NICKY: Had to be him .
ELLIOT: She was very evasive .
NICKY: I 'm enjoying this more every minute .
DODGIE: How do you want the sideburns .
NICKY: Elegant and refined .
NICKY: I loved my taxi . A checkered cab . Big and rumbly .
TOYOTA: I 'm looking at you trying to think . Put your face in the mirror . I know I recognize you from somewhere .
NICKY: Everybody else does . Why not you ?
TOYOTA: You 're Frankie Lazzaro . The gangster from Rhode Island .
NICKY: Oh yeah ?
TOYOTA: Matthew , look at him . When I lived in Roxbury , the media followed this man everywhere . He was bigger than ten movie stars . Where 's your white Lincoln limo ?
NICKY: Some little kid stole the hubcaps .
TOYOTA: The most charming gangster in New England . Where are we going , Mr. Lazzaro ?
NICKY: Call me Frankie . And it looks like we 're going nowhere .
TOYOTA: Might be an accident on the West Side Highway .
NICKY: How come you got the kid with you ?
TOYOTA: Matthew 's my grandson .
NICKY: A grandmother . God bless you .
TOYOTA: He does bless me , each and every day . Matthew 's mother works a hospital shift , so I pick him up at school . We stop for a meal usually around this time . He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people . But we never had a famous mobster before .
NICKY: It 's the kid 's lucky day .
TOYOTA: This is one charming crook . If shooting people is charming .
NICKY: Now that 's a complicated subject .
TOYOTA: That 's a simple subject .
NICKY: Look , we 're stuck here front and ack . It 's dinnertime for you , game time for me . Let 's park the cab and go to Mannion 's . What do you say , Matthew ? We 'll drink beer and talk aseball .
NICKY: Georgie .
GEORGIE: Nicky , God bless . You 're well ? You family 's well ? That 's all that counts .
NICKY: Are you absolutely sure ?
GEORGIE: Hey . I love this guy . Be good . Stay well . I 'm serious Give my best to everybody .
MATTHEW: What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you ?
NICKY: This place becomes famous . Tou uses . Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall .
TOYOTA: You see what you 're doing , do n't you ?
NICKY: What am I doing ?
TOYOTA: You 're charming the boy .
NICKY: Hey , Toyota . He asked me a question .
TOYOTA: Frankie Lazzaro . Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media . Children see this . They think you 're the Secretary of the Treasury .
NICKY: That 's my cousin , Angelo .
JACK: This could be it .
PETER: This could be it .
JACK: This could be it .
PETER: This could be it .
JACK: Does it feel comfortable ?
PETER: Does what feel comfortable ?
JACK: This could be it .
PETER: This could be it .
MATTHEW: What 's it like to shoot somebody ?
NICKY: I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi . But let 's put a lid on the questions .
TOYOTA: Go on , tell him . Tell the truth . Tell him how you feel , shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody 's flesh who was once a child , who was once the same age as this boy . Somebody 's flesh who was innocent once .
NICKY: It 's complicated . It 's a whole life . A person does n't commit an act of violence out of nowhere . There are strong forces at work .
TV VOICES: Dew-eeey ! Rog-errr !
TOYOTA: You 're a family man , Frankie ?
NICKY: Wife and daughter . My father 's still alive .
TOYOTA: An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy , and then in one dumb moment , what does he do ?
NICKY: I do n't know Toyota . What does he do ?
TOYOTA: And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him . Despite who he is and what he does for a living . We 're always saying we want to take control of ou lives . You do n't want to take control . You want to lose control . Jesus knows it .
NICKY: It 's a complicated subject .
TOYOTA: It 's a simple subject .
LILLIAN: Your father said you might be here .
NICKY: Two-all after six .
LILLIAN: I 've been looking for you because I want to let you know what 's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column .
NICKY: We stranded five runners in the first two innings . This will come ack to haunt us .
LILLIAN: I want to be fair-minded , Nicky .
NICKY: All right . What 's been going on ?
LILLIAN: I 've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer .
NICKY: How prominent ?
LILLIAN: He has his own submarine . I 'll be getting everything that matters . I 'll get New York and I 'll get Connecticut .
NICKY: I 'll have whatever she 's having .
LILLIAN: I do n't want to be responsible fo his food . Just a small green salad . And a Perrier .
NICKY: Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning .
WAITER: Yessiree , Bob .
NICKY: Get the hell out of here . I do n't want you bringing our food . Send a eal waiter .
BAR VOICES: Rog-errrr ! Dew-eeey !
NICKY: Opening night , Lillian .
LILLIAN: Who the hell cares ?
NICKY: The whole thing is my fault . I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding . You understand me .
LILLIAN: That 's always been my problem .
NICKY: And you 've been extremely patient .
LILLIAN: You know why , do n't you ? Because I am patient , chain-smoking Lillian .
NICKY: You smoked because I smoked . We were falling in love , remember ? I used to see certain movies only ecause you had seen them . I wanted to see what you saw .
LILLIAN: I 'd forgotten that .
NICKY: I went because you went . You smoked ecause I smoked .
LILLIAN: That 's very lovely actually .
NICKY: Laurel wants us to be honest and open . Let 's be open with each other .
LILLIAN: Be open with me . I 'd like that .
NICKY: There may be things you 'd rathe not know about .
LILLIAN: I want to know . We have n't talked this way in years .
NICKY: I had an affair are you sure you want to hear this ?
LILLIAN: Joanne Bourne .
NICKY: Alma Wetzel .
LILLIAN: Nicky , no . This is insupportable . How could you ?
NICKY: I 'm a man . She 's , you know , a woman .
LILLIAN: She 's my gynecologist .
NICKY: I am really , deeply sorry .
LILLIAN: It violates so many trusts .
NICKY: It was an animal thing . No real intimacy .
LILLIAN: I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office .
NICKY: We did it in the office . She thought her apartment was too impersonal .
LILLIAN: I 'm glad we 're having this talk .
NICKY: I feel great . I feel impeccably alive . I 'm elated . Eat something . Please . I love you .
LILLIAN: You look awful , sweetheart . Get a haircut . Get a lawyer .
MATTHEW: Great game . Red Sox are winning .
NICKY: They 're always winning . Until they lose .
TOYOTA: Your problem is you take the easy way out . Losing is easy .
NICKY: Winning is easy . Losing is complicated . It 's a lifetime 's work .
TOYOTA: It may be work but it 's not honest work . Faith is the real work .
MATTHEW: Clemens has a blister . Look . They 're pinch-hitting for him .
NICKY: He 's a twenty-four-game winner . He pitches seven solid innings . We scratch out a one-run lead . Of course he gets a blister . Of course they put up Greenwell even though Baylor 's sitting on the bench . Of course Greenwell strikes out .
TOYOTA: You made him strike out . You wished it on him . You want to lose . It 's too hard for you to believe in something . It 's hard to have faith . It 's hard Nwork to trust somebody .
NICKY: `` It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day . ''
TOYOTA: You 're afraid to risk believing . Believe in them . Believe in you self . Take a risk . It will humanize you as a person .
NICKY: I want to believe .
TOYOTA: If you believed , you would n't be walking around with a handgun in your belt . What does that tell me ? You want to make the night come down .
FATHER: I always thought a night 's sleep is what you get for a hard day 's work . But these last weeks I lie there helpless . Hour after hour . I 've come close to praying for the first time since I was your age . Pray to God to put Sme out .
SON: I talked to the doctor again , Pop . He said she 's not getting any etter . He wants to talk to you . I think he means right away .
FATHER: How bad is she ?
SON: This could be it .
TOYOTA: Say it and you 'll believe it . Life is good . Say it .
NICKY: I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments .
TOYOTA: Then say it .
NICKY: Life is good .
TOYOTA: Speak it like it 's real . Matthew .
MATTHEW: Life is good .
NICKY: Life is good .

NICKY: Backman flies to Rice . It 's like a eautiful song lyric .
NICKY: All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won . All the awful things I said to my mother and father . To Tmy wife and daughter .
TOYOTA: Washed away .
NICKY: Because life is good .
TOYOTA: Because faith is rewarded .
NICKY: All the failures , all the fatalism .
MATTHEW: Washed away .

LAUREL: You have to tell me what you thought of the play .
STEVEN: First you tell me .
LAUREL: Brilliantly moving .
STEVEN: What else ?
LAUREL: Packs an emotional wallop .
STEVEN: What else ?
LAUREL: A flat-out hit .
STEVEN: Are you majoring in theate criticism .
LAUREL: Criminology .
STEVEN: If you 're wondering about the firearm .
LAUREL: Yes .
STEVEN: This building is not secure .
LAUREL: I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before , you know , I can feel completely free to be myself .
STEVEN: We 're strangers in the night . The last thing we want is honesty .
LAUREL: What do we want ?
STEVEN: Mystery . Deception .
LAUREL: Deception is n't something I personally consider sexy .
STEVEN: What 's sexy ?
LAUREL: Knowing who a person is . Down deep .
STEVEN: Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking ?
LAUREL: You wo n't even tell me your name . What 's shocking about a name ?
STEVEN: Even if the truth requires a certain adjustment ?
NICKY: I used to go to the movies all the time .
NICKY: These wives named Lillian . I used to say to her , ` You do n't kick a door once or twice and expect it to open . It 's only in the movies a man can kick in a door with such amazing ease . Because a real doo equires a tremendous and prolonged pounding before it finally gives way . ' He 's a great playerhow could that ball go through his legs ?
LAUREL: I do n't think he knew , Daddy .
STEVEN: Am I really so deeply repugnant ?
LAUREL: Yes .
NICKY: Go home , Laurel . Tell your mother I will be late .
LAUREL: Except I wo n't have a fathe anymore .
NICKY: I 'll see you all the time . I 'll get a place right nearby . One room . No distractions . We 'll talk .
LAUREL: What will we talk about ?
NICKY: Everything .
LAUREL: Will I believe you when you tell me something ?
NICKY: There 's nothing left for me to lie about .
LAUREL: Daddy , wait .
STEVEN: Then they lost ?
NICKY: Why does it matter ?
STEVEN: If they lost tonight , they 'll lose tomorrow . It 's all over .
NICKY: Why do you care ?
STEVEN: They 're my team .
NICKY: No . They 're not your team . They 're my team .
STEVEN: They 're my team , too . I grew up on Boyleston Street . Right by Fenway Park . I went to fifty or sixty games a year . All by myself . I was one of those kids with scabby elbows . I called out to the players . ` Look over here . Hi , I 'm Steven . My parents are divorced . '
NICKY: I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox . I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game . My wife is from Boston . Lillian Ziegler ?
STEVEN: The Red Sox were my world . I surrendered my existence to a team that could n't win the big one .
NICKY: If you 're such a devoted fan , why were you at the play tonight instead of the game ? Answe carefully . This is important . You could have gone to the theater last night . There was no game last night .
STEVEN: Because I ca n't bear to watch . When they lose , I die inside . It 's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies . I wait fo the scores . I still die , hearing the scores , but it 's over in a second . I ca n't survive the game pitch by pitch , inning by inning . I 've done it too many times . And I ca n't do it anymore .
NICKY: I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first . That 's when I knew the Red Sox were my team . Pity and terror .
STEVEN: When I traveled through Asia this summer , I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a ca with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores . I drove through the wa in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour , fo updates .
NICKY: What about my play ?
LAUREL: Yes . And no more evasive tactics .
STEVEN: It 's your best play , Nicky .
LAUREL: See , Daddy .
STEVEN: I 've seen it twice . I went back tonight to be sure . It 's a brave and honest piece of work .
LAUREL: What else ?
STEVEN: An artistry and sensitivity you 've never shown before .
NICKY: And you 're not saying that because of the gun in my hand ?
STEVEN: You 're out of bullets .
LAUREL: See , Daddy .
STEVEN: And Peter Redmond helped immensely . These pauses were exquisitely timed . He made us wait and wait . He uilt a gorgeous tension and suspense .
NICKY: We worked very hard on the pauses .
STEVEN: I called Sports Phone from Lhasa , Tibet . Freezing in my little rented Fiat . Sheep on a hillside . Rocky debris dating back millions and millions of years , from the time the Himalayas thrust up when the plates of India and Asia collided . Red Sox 3 , White Sox 2 . A moment in the history of the world .
LAUREL: Faster , Daddy .

FEINGOLD: Application , MMPI and TAT tests , financial statement Want some ? Tung Hoy , best in Chinatown The tests serve a threefold purpose . First off , are you right for us ? Are we right for you ? Unfortunately , there 's a limited number of slots
SCHUYLER: Let 's back up here

SCHUYLER: The type .
FEINGOLD: You know , a player .
SCHUYLER: I 'm not a player .
FEINGOLD: I do n't mean anything personal by it I know you 're an important guy , powerful guy , you 're used to being on top . It 's just , this is n't fo everyone . Not everyone can handle it .
SCHUYLER: What kind of fu game is this ?
FEINGOLD: The ultimate fucking game . I wish I could tell you more , but it 's different every time . Thanks for coming in
SCHUYLER: I 'm not an idiot . I see what you 're doing . First the vague yet intriguing pitch , then I 'm supposed to feel like my manhood 's in question because I 'm not up for , what , some motivational ole-playing fantasy nonsense
FEINGOLD: Interesting , you do n't know the first thing about it but you 've already decided what it is Listen , I do n't wan na waste any more
SCHUYLER: Please , Jim , cut the hard-to-get shit . I 've got the afternoon free , I 'll take your silly tests .

FEINGOLD: Sorry to keep you waiting , a client 's head exploded You can get dressed , we 're done .
SCHUYLER: This was actually a gift . Did my other pay in advance ?
FEINGOLD: You 'd have to ask our billing department the price varies . But our service comes with a guarantee . If you 're not satisfied , there 's no charge . And we 've never had an unsatisfied customer
SCHUYLER: You mean dissatisfied .
FEINGOLD: Mm , that 's right you 're a left- ain word fetishist .

BARTENDER: I believe so .
SCHUYLER: This round 's on me . Schuyler moves casually toward the men
PETE: last time I played Pebble , I swore I 'd never pick up a club again
SCHUYLER: Great thing about golf , the way it takes you out of your life Speaking of games I take it you two are familiar with CRS ?
JOHN: Uh-oh . Time to piss
PETE: Why do you ask , Schuyler ?
SCHUYLER: I could n't help overhearing
PETE: We do n't usually talk about it .
SCHUYLER: I only bring it up because , well , I recently tested for it .
PETE: Did you ? Kudos .
SCHUYLER: I just was n't sure if they 're fo eal , whether it 's worth it
PETE: Worth it Gee , I dunno they did save my fucking life
SCHUYLER: Sorry ?
PETE: Look , I do n't know you , you do n't know me , but I hit a certain point , nothing meant anything . My work , the wife and kids hell with 'em , I was sick of it all , y'know ? But CRS they changed everything . `` Are they fo eal ? '' Who cares , maybe nothing is . To reality .
JOHN: C'mon Pete .
PETE: Good luck , pal . You 'll need it .

KEN CASTLE: Slayers .
KEN CASTLE: I 'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68 % of the American public .
PRODUCER: What 'd he say ?
KEN CASTLE: There 's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers should n't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out ? Besides - they only need to survive one session .
KEN CASTLE: Simple .
KEN CASTLE: Did I ? You know I seem to recall that - let 's just see CASTLE waves in his PERSONAL SECURITY
PRODUCER: This motherfucker is off the charts .
BOARD OP: That 's fuckin scary .
KEN CASTLE: Similar , yep . But control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming environments .
KEN CASTLE: Someone else making all the decisions for you no esponsibilities , no tough choices think about it .
KEN CASTLE: Good little talk .
PRODUCER: What the hell is that ?
HUMANZ BROTHER: Ken Castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer , etter world . He 's a liar . Mind control is slavery . We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue .
PRODUCER: Mr. Castle , we have no idea
KEN CASTLE: Shush !

HISPANIC GUARD: Who aims ?
KABLE: What ?
HISPANIC GUARD: Who aims the slayer ? Or the player ?
KABLE: Not much to aiming it 's just hand/eye coordination . I 'm the hand someone , somewhere else is the eye .
HISPANIC GUARD: That 's tripped .
KABLE: Sometimes they take over - you know , completely . They move you . Like a robot . But it does n't work so good that part 's just for show . You ca n't eally fight that way .
HISPANIC GUARD: Why ?
KABLE: There 's a delay
HISPANIC GUARD: Yeah , the ping they talk about that . The time it takes the slaye to respond to the command it 's like , five millisecond ping , eight millisecond ping KABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN .
KABLE: Whatever you call it . A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there . When the trigger pulls - He pulls the trigger a meaty CLICK . KABLE It 's just me .

CASTLE 3: He 's right . CASTLE faces them .
CASTLE: They do now . But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs , so vivid it 's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me , they 'll change their point of view .
CASTLE 2: How can you be sure ?
CASTLE: It 's human nature . They 'll be seduced by the power , the violence the dominance
CASTLE 3: Guess we never figured on Kable lowing up as big as he did .
CASTLE: Bigger than the game ? No . Then again , who ever would 've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con
CASTLE 2: Tillman is a perfect soldier , a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers . What did you expect ?
CASTLE 3: His instincts give him an edge .
CASTLE 2: And in the hands of a talented player
CASTLE 3: Of course we can never let him out . Not after what we did to him .
CASTLE 2: Tell me again why we do n't just get id of the problem You know , off camera ? CASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2 .
CASTLE: YOU - lack a flair for marketing . The people would never accept that . They need to SEE their gladiators ought down .

HUMANZ DUDE: But this is only the beginning .
HUMANZ BROTHER: Think about it the federal prison system is growing out of control , set to bankrupt the whole damn USA Castle rides in on a white horse , says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line .

KABLE: Yeah . He was .
HUMANZ BROTHER: The second was you . KABLE fights difficult memories .
KABLE: The idea was to replace your brain , it by bit , cell by cell , gradual the new tissue would never break down , neve deteriorate . A new era in human longevity is what they told us . We were doing the world a favor .
HUMANZ BROTHER: Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum . Castle 's project was shut down but the shit was n't a total loss the same technology esurfaced within a year in a game . Castle called it society .
KABLE: Thank you for the history lesson .
HUMANZ BROTHER: Dig me , Tillman . Whatever happened in that project is something Castle wan na be buried . We need that shit , aby what you saw , what you know .

GORGE: Hooz there ?
GEEK LEADER: Tech support .

ANGIE: I missed you so much
KABLE: Delia .

KABLE: That 's all the story you 're going to get .
SIMON: Cool .
AGENT KEITH: Yeah , ai n't it ? Looks like someone up the chain decided you 're no longer a threat .
FEMALE VOICE: No link no link . SIMON slumps against the wall , DEFEATED .
KABLE: Delia and finally breaking into a run - until
KEN CASTLE: You 're awesome .
KABLE: Castle .
KEN CASTLE: Kable . They speak simultaneously
KEN CASTLE: But mine 's different . Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in your head , Kable - is designed to eceive . I think it , you do it .
KABLE: Very nice , Castle . So you 've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you .
KEN CASTLE: You 're thinking small , Kable . But not as small as me .
KABLE: You should 've let him fight fo himself , Castle - he might 've had a shot .
KEN CASTLE: I think you 're missing the point , my man .
KABLE: No , I get it - you 're pulling the strings on all of this which makes my next move pretty easy to figure .
KEN CASTLE: Neglected to mention my smart boys eversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy , once we had access to their drives
KEN CASTLE: Come on , lets boogie woogie rock and roll .

KEN CASTLE: Biggest , baddest Slayer in the game do n't seem like much , does he ?
KABLE: No .
KEN CASTLE: Just like last time . Remember ?
PONYTAIL GEEK: There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address .
GEEK LEADER: Someone on the outside is sending him commands

SIMON: Sorry .
DELIA: Are you my Daddy Tillman ?
KABLE: Wait .
GEEK: Pardon ?
KABLE: The nanex . Set us free . The GEEKS look at one another . KABLE It 's nothing to you . A mouse- click . GEEK LEADER shrugs .
GEEK LEADER: True dat . He nods to PONYTAIL GEEK do it . The GEEK LEADER betrays a ghost of a smile . GEEK LEADER Well played , Kable .
DELIA: Mommy . Why did Daddy Tillman hurt Daddy Ken ?
TRACE: This is for you , you dumb bitch . I hope you do the right thing with it .
KABLE: You good , sweetheart ? DELIA nods .
MANU: Brother Bapu is already late fo prayers .
GANDHI: Oh , God oh , God
MURROW: The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived a private man without wealth , without property , without official title o office
GANDHI: Tell me do you think about hell ?
PORTER: `` Hell ! ''
GANDHI: No neither do I . But ut this man is a Christian and he has written
PORTER: Excuse me , baas , but how long have you been in South Africa ?
GANDHI: A a week .
PORTER: Well , I do n't know how you got a ticket for
CONDUCTOR: Here coolie , just what are you doing in this car ?
GANDHI: Why I I have a ticket . A First Class ticket .
CONDUCTOR: How did you get hold of it ?
GANDHI: I sent for it in the post . I 'm an attorney , and I did n't have time to
EUROPEAN: There are no colored attorneys in South Africa . Go and sit where you elong .
PORTER: I 'll take your luggage back , baas .
GANDHI: No , no just a moment , please .
EUROPEAN: Did n't you hear me ? There are no colored attorneys in South Africa !
GANDHI: Sir , I was called to the bar in London and enrolled in the High Court of Chancery I am therefore an attorney , and since I am in you eyes colored I think we can deduce that there is at least one colored attorney in South Africa . The Porter stares amazed !
EUROPEAN: Smart bloody kaffir throw him out ! He turns and walks out of the compartment .
CONDUCTOR: You move your damn sammy carcass ack to third class or I 'll have you thrown off at the next station .
GANDHI: I always go First Class ! I have traveled all over England and I 've never
KHAN: I 'm rich but I 'm Indian . I therefore do not expect to travel First Class .
GANDHI: In England , I was a poor student but
KHAN: That was England .
GANDHI: This part of `` England 's '' Empire !
SINGH: Mr. Gandhi , you look at Mr. Khan and see a successful Muslim trader . The South Africans see him simply as an Indian . And the vast majority of Indians mostly Hindu like yourself were brought here to work the mines and harvest the crops and the Europeans do n't want them doing anything else .
GANDHI: But that is very un-Christian . Mr. Baker smothers a smile .
TYEB MOHAMMED: Mr. Gandhi , in this country Indians are not allowed to walk along a pavement with a `` Christian '' ! Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously .
GANDHI: You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney , but you ca n't walk down the street with him ?
KHAN: I can . But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less `` holy '' than Mr. Baker .
GANDHI: Well , then , it must be fought . We are children of God like everyone else .
KHAN: Allah be praised . And what battalions will you call upon ?
GANDHI: I I will write to the press here and in England . And I will use the courts . He lifts the documents threateningly .
SINGH: You will make a lot of trouble .
GANDHI: We are members of the Empire . And we come from an ancient civilization . Why should we not walk on the pavements like other men ?
KHAN: I rather like the idea of an Indian arrister in South Africa . I 'm sure our community could keep you in work for some time , Mr. Gandhi even if you caused a good deal of trouble . Especially if you caused a good deal of trouble .
GANDHI: There 's the English reporter . I told you he 'd come .
KHAN: You also said your article would draw a thousand people . At least some of the Hindus brought their wives .
GANDHI: No . I asked my wife to organize that .
SINGH: Some of them are leaving
GANDHI: Ladies and Gentlemen , we have asked you to gather here to help us proclaim our right to be treated as equal citizens of the Empire .
KHAN: You write brilliantly , but you have much to learn about handling men .
POLICE SERGEANT: Oh , no , you bloody well do n't !
BA: Let me go !
SERGEANT: Stop !
GANDHI: You saved the papers .
BA: I wish you were still struggling fo work in Bombay .
GANDHI: I hated that all the pettiness , the little corruptions . And I was more laughing stock than lawyer .
BA: As I told you about English policemen .
GANDHI: Yes ?
HARILAL: We are glad to have you back , Bapu . Gandhi smiles .
GANDHI: And I am glad to be back . Come
BA: Be careful !
GANDHI: Tomorrow I will tell you what it feels like to be a jailbird .
AYAH: Come . Come .
GANDHI: Just like proper English gentlemen . I 'm proud of them .
BA: They are boys . And they 're Indian .
GANDHI: Hm . Will you take this off ? It pinches every time I speak .
BA: Are you sure ?
GANDHI: Yes I ca n't talk like this .
BA: Mr. Khan said they called you brave .
GANDHI: If you would let me teach you to ead , you could see for yourself .
BA: I could have told them you were merely foolish .
GANDHI: It proves what I told you . If I had prosecuted him as everyone advised even you they would have hated me y showing forgiveness I ouch ! She has pulled the other piece .
BA: There
GANDHI: You see there is such a thing as moral force and it can be harnessed .
BA: Not always . You have told me twice now that you were giving up the pleasures of the flesh .
GANDHI: I am . I am convinced the holy men are right . When you give up , you gain . The simpler your life the etter .
BA: If you enjoy it a great deal you must fast for two days . Gandhi laughs and buries her in love .
SMUTS: Yes ? The tall civil servant checks his notes .
CHARLIE: You 'd be Gandhi I thought you 'd be bigger .
GANDHI: I 'm sorry .
CHARLIE: I I mean it 's all right . It does n't matter . I 'm my name is Andrews , Charlie Andrews . I 've come from India I 've read a great deal about you .
GANDHI: Some of it good , I hope .
CHARLIE: Yes . I 've I 've met some very emarkable people in India and and when I read what you 've been doing here , I I wanted to help . Does that surprise you ?
GANDHI: Not anymore . At first I was amazed but when you are fighting in a just cause , people seem to pop up like you ight out of the pavement . Even when it is dangerous or
FIRST YOUTH: Hey look what 's comin ' !
SECOND YOUTH: A white shepherd leading a brown sammy !
CHARLIE: Perhaps I should Gandhi restrains him and shakes his head .
GANDHI: Does n't the New Testament say , `` If your enemy strikes you on the right cheek , offer him the left '' ?
CHARLIE: I think perhaps the phrase was used metaphorically I do n't think ou Lord meant
GANDHI: I 'm not so certain . I have thought about it a great deal . I suspect he meant you must show courage be willing to take a blow several lows to show you will not strike ack nor will you be turned aside And when
FIRST YOUTH: Get off the pavement , you bloody
COLIN'S MOTHER: You 're already late for work . I thought you 'd gone ten minutes ago .
GANDHI: You 'll find there 's room for us both .
CHARLIE: That was lucky .
GANDHI: I thought you were a man of God .
CHARLIE: I am . But I 'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas . Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner .
GANDHI: you could call it a `` communal farm , '' I suppose . But we 've all come to the same conclusion our Gita , the Muslim 's Koran or your Bible it 's always the simple things that catch your breath `` Love thy neighbor as thyself '' not always practiced but it 's something we Hindus could learn a lot from .
CHARLIE: That 's the sort of thing you 'll be seeking on this `` farm ''
GANDHI: Well , we shall try .
SONJA: They 're going to change the pass laws . Gandhi absorbs the news stiffly .
SECOND VOICE: Just one second , sir , please .
SMUTS: But on a short trip , I would n't spend too much time on the Indian question , Mr. Walker . It 's a tiny factor in South African life .
WALKER: It 's news at the moment . I will certainly report on your mines and the economy but I would like to meet this Mr. Gandhi .
SMUTS: Of course . We Westerners have a weakness for these these spiritually inclined men of India . But as an old lawyer , let me warn you , Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man as you will ever meet , howeve `` otherworldly '' he may seem . But I 'm sure you 're enough of a reporter to see that . The gaze is firm , strong , cynical
GANDHI: so it 's not `` spiritualism '' o `` nationalism '' we 're not against anything but the idea that people ca n't live together .
WALKER: Hm . And what should an `` important professional '' write about you esponse to General Smuts 's new legislation ?
GANDHI: I do n't know I 'm still searching for a `` response . ''
WALKER: You will respect the law .
GANDHI: There are unjust laws as there are unjust men .
WALKER: You 're a very small minority to take on the Government and the Empire . Gandhi seems trapped by an ineluctable fact .
GANDHI: If you are a minority of one , the truth is the truth .
WALKER: Well , it 's quite a place , you `` ashram '' is that right ?
GANDHI: That 's right . The word only means `` community . '' But it could stand fo `` village '' or the world . Walker looks at him appraisingly .
WALKER: You 're an ambitious man .
GANDHI: I hope not .
WALKER: They tell me you also take your turn at peeling potatoes and cleaning the `` outhouse '' is that part of the experiment ?
GANDHI: Ba we will need another place set for Mr. Walker 's driver . Ba looks at him coldly .
BA: I will tell Sora .
GANDHI: It 's one way to learn that each man 's labor is as important as another 's . In fact when you 're doing it , `` cleaning the outhouse '' seems fa more important than the law .
BA: Sora was sent to tell me I I must ake and cover the latrine .
GANDHI: Everyone takes his turn .
BA: It is the work of untouchables .
GANDHI: In this place there are no untouchables and no work is beneath any of us !
BA: I am your wife .
GANDHI: All the more reason .
BA: As you command .
GANDHI: It 's not me . It 's the principle . And you will do it with joy or not do it at all ! Ba settles back defiantly .
BA: Not at all then
GANDHI: All right , go ! You do n't belong here ! Go ! Leave the ashram ! Get out altogether ! We do n't want you !
BA: Stop it ! Stop it ! What are you doing ! ?
GANDHI: What is the matter with me ?
BA: You are human only human . Gandhi looks up at her , blankly , abjectly .
GANDHI: I apologize
BA: And I must rake and cover the latrine .
GANDHI: I want to welcome you all !
KHAN: He 's become quite good at this .
GANDHI: And a policeman passing an Indian dwelling I will not call them homes may enter and demand the card or any Indian woman whose dwelling it is .
A VOICE: God damn them ! Gandhi just waits .
GANDHI: Understand ! He does not have to stand at the door he may enter .
MERCHANT: I swear to Allah I will kill the man who offers that insult to my home and my wife ! And let them hang me !
TYEB MOHAMMED: I say talk means nothing . Kill a few officials before they disgrace one Indian woman then they might think twice about such laws !
GANDHI: I praise such courage . I need such courage because in this cause , I too am prepared to die But , my friend , there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill .
CIVILIAN: These men are contracted laborers . They belong in the mines .
GANDHI: You have put their comrades in jail . When you free them they will go back to work .
CIVILIAN: I 've warned you .
GANDHI: We have warned each other .
SINGH: I do n't think that is very good .
SERGEANT: At the canter for-ward !
MINER: We should lie down the horses wo n't tramp on us . Down ! Down ! Everyone lie down !
GANDHI: Lie down ! Lie down !
MINER: The horses have more mercy than the men .
SERGEANT: You 're right !
GANDHI: Lie down ! Lie down !
SERGEANT: Follow me !
CIVILIAN: Let them march In our own sweet time , in our own sweet way we 'll get them .
CHARLIE: Some of you may be rejoicing that Mr. Gandhi has at last been put into prison . The congregation is listening to him stiffly ,
GANDHI: They 're sparing no one , I see .
KHAN: No . You were the surprise . It 's been all over the prison . We thought they 'd e too afraid of the English press .
GANDHI: So did I . He takes his soup from Khan .
KHAN: Do n't worry about the meat it 's Hindu there 's not a trace .
GANDHI: My wife publicly defied the law . They 've arrested her and four others .
KHAN: The fools ! Sorry
GANDHI: It 's split the Government .
KHAN: Well , that 's one victory .
GANDHI: If we hold firm , it wo n't be the last .
KHAN: Do n't worry I 've never seen men so determined . You 've given them a way to fight And I do n't think
PRISON OFFICER: Gandhi ! I want Gandhi ! Which sammy is it ?
SMUTS: Ah , Mr. Gandhi . I thought we might have a little talk .
GANDHI: Thank you . No .
SMUTS: Perhaps some tea ?
GANDHI: I dined at the prison .
SMUTS: Ahh .
GANDHI: Well , if you ask , General Smuts , I 'm sure it will be done . Smuts smiles .
SMUTS: Hm . Of course it is not quite that simple .
GANDHI: Somehow I expected not .
SMUTS: I 'm glad to hear you say that very glad . You see if we repeal the Act under pressure under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment . Can you understand that ?
GANDHI: Very well .
SMUTS: Good . Good . I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to `` investigate '' the new legislation . I think I could guarantee they would ecommend the Act be repealed .
GANDHI: I congratulate them .
SMUTS: But they might also recommend that future Indian immigration be severely estricted even stopped .
GANDHI: Immigration was not an issue on which we fought . It would be wrong of us to make it one now that we we are in a position of advantage . Smuts stares at him a moment , then
SMUTS: You 're an extraordinary man .
GANDHI: I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment .
SMUTS: I 'm ordering the release of all prisoners within the next twenty- four hours . You yourself are free from this moment .
GANDHI: Yes yes . It 's just that in these clothes I 'd I 'd prefer to go by taxi .
SMUTS: All right . Fine .
GANDHI: I 'm I 'm afraid I have no money .
SMUTS: Oh ! Neither have I. I 'm awfully sorry . The tall civil servant enters .
DANIELS: I beg your pardon , sir ?
SMUTS: How far will you be going , Mr. Gandhi ?
GANDHI: Well now that this is settled I had thought seriously of going ack to India ut a shilling will do splendidly for the moment .
SMUTS: He 's either a great man or a colossal fraud Either way , I shall be glad to see the last of him .
YOUNG ENGLISHMAN: By God , he loves it
SECOND ENGLISHMAN: I 'm sure he hates it .
YOUNG ENGLISHMAN: It must be that Indian that made all that fuss back in Africa . My cabin oy told me he was on board .
SECOND ENGLISHMAN: Why have n't we seen him ? Gandhi ?
YOUNG ENGLISHMAN: Yes . That 's it . He was traveling Third Class . There he is . Their point of view .
GANDHI: No , no , I have n't `` refused '' I I simply wanted to dress the way my comrades in prison dressed .
ENGLISH JOURNALIST: Will you support the war effort , Mr. Gandhi ?
GANDHI: I I have demanded rights as a British citizen , it is therefore my duty to help in the defense of the British Empire .
AMERICAN REPORTER: What are you going to do now that you 're back in India ?
GANDHI: I do n't know I do n't know
NEHRU: Please , Mr. Gandhi .
BA: My dignity comes from following my husband .
NEHRU: Just a few words then we 'll get you to civilization .
GANDHI: I I am glad to be home . I I thank you for your greeting .
NEHRU: We 'll follow with your wife do n't worry , everything 's arranged .
GANDHI: Who is that young man ?
PATEL: That 's young Nehru . He 's got his father 's intellect , his mother 's looks and the devil 's charm . If they do n't ruin him at Cambridge Wave ! Wave ! he may amount to something .
GANDHI: I 'm hardly that , Mr. Patel .
PATEL: Oh , yes , you are . It 's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it . And stop calling me Mr. Patel , you 're not a junio clerk anymore .
GANDHI: No .
PATEL: The new Military Governor of the North West Province was on that ship . Too bad you came back Third Class he might have been impressed by a successful barrister who had outmaneuvered General Smuts .
GANDHI: Yes I 'm sure
MRS. NEHRU: No , I leave practical matters to my husband and revolution to my son She nods lightly toward Nehru .
NEHRU: Mr. Jinnah , our joint host , membe of Congress , and the leader of the Muslim League and Mr. Prakash , who I fear is awaiting trial for sedition and inducement to murder .
PRAKASH: I have not actually pulled a trigger , Mr. Gandhi , I have simply written that if an Englishman kills an Indian for disobeying his law , then it is an Indian 's duty to kill an Englishman for enforcing his law in a land that is not his . Gandhi nods
GANDHI: It is a clever argument ; I am not sure it will produce the end you desire .
JINNAH: We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule , Mr. Gandhi .
CHARLIE: May I ? Mohan I would like you to meet someone .
NEHRU: He told the press he would support the British in the war .
PRAKASH: That 's non-violence for you .
JINNAH: Is he a fool ? Nehru grins slowly , thoughtfully .
NEHRU: I 'm not certain But I would n't be surprised .
CHARLIE: I lied to you , Mohan , when I told you I decided to come to South Africa to meet you . Professor Gokhale sent me .
GOKHALE: We 're trying to make a nation , Gandhi and the British keep trying to break us up into religions and principalities and `` provinces . '' What you were writing in South Africa that 's what we need here .
GANDHI: I have much to learn about India . And I have to begin my practice again one needs money to run a journal .
GOKHALE: Nonsense . Go on , Charlie . This is Indian talk we want none of you imperialists .
CHARLIE: All right I 'll go and write my eport to the Viceroy .
GOKHALE: Go and find a pretty Hindu woman and convert her to Christianity that 's as much mischief as you 're allowed .
GANDHI: I have little to say . India is an `` alien '' country to me .
GOKHALE: Well , change that . Go and find India . Not what you see here , but the real India . You 'll see what needs to be said . What we need to hear .
TROOP LEADER: Clear the way ! Get out of the way !
GANDHI: I ask you to pray for those who died . For the English soldiers who were doing what they thought was ight . And for the brave terrorists whose patriotism led them to do what was wrong .
PATEL: I agree with Jinnah . Now that the Americans are in , the war will end soon . The Germans are worn out as it is and our first act should be to convene a Congress Party convention and demand independence . Nehru takes an iced drunk from a servant .
JINNAH: And we must speak with one voice united .
PATEL: Ah we should invite Gandhi . What the devil has happened to him anyway ?
NEHRU: He 's `` discovering '' India .
JINNAH: Which is a lot better than causing trouble where it matters . Invite him let him say his piece about South Africa and then let him slip into oblivion .
BA: Please ! You 're being foolish !
GANDHI: There 's no room ! And the air is lovely . She grimaces severely and tugs at him .
CHARLIE: No violence , please .
GANDHI: Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall .
INDIAN: Englishman Sahib !
FIRST INDIAN: Place the foot on the window .
GANDHI: What are you doing ?
CHARLIE: Going nearer to God !
BA: Charlie ! Be careful ! !
CHARLIE: Mohan ! !
GANDHI: Let go ! You 'll kill him ! Ba is confused .
FIRST INDIAN: You see most comfortable . Charlie nods grimly .
BA: Please , God , no !
SECOND INDIAN: Are you Christian , Sahib ?
CHARLIE: Yes , yes , I 'm a Christian .
SECOND INDIAN: I know a Christian . She drinks blood . Charlie stares at him in surprise .
GANDHI'S VOICE: Charlie ! ! The Indians turn . Charlie turns .
FIRST INDIAN: It 's all right , Sahib ! Very safe end bend !
INDIAN'S VOICE: Pray to God , Sahib ! Now is when it is best to be Hindu !
JINNAH: We were asked for toleration . We were asked for patience . Some gave it and some did not . Well , their wa is over ! And those of us who supported it , and those of us who refused must forget our differences !
PATEL: And let no one question that Mr. Jinnah speaks not just for the Muslims ut for all India !
GANDHI: I am flattered by Mr. Patel I would be even more flattered if what he said were true . He means about the journal .
PATEL: But it 's true ! I I read it often .
GANDHI: Since I returned from South Africa , I have traveled over much of India . And I know I could travel many more years and still only see a small part of it .
NEHRU: Have you read his magazine ?
PATEL: No but I think I 'm going to .
FIRST FRIEND: This ca n't be the way !
SECOND FRIEND: Yes , I 'm sure this is the direction India is taking . The others laugh ; Nehru suffers .
NEHRU: We 're looking for Mr. Gandhi !
CHARLIE: Ah , you 'll find him under the tree y the river . You 'd better leave the car the ground is rather soft .
NEHRU: Thank you . . . He looks around the ashram a little dismally .
FIRST FRIEND: Come on ! I 'm anxious to meet this new `` force '' !
GANDHI: I try to live like an Indian , as you see it is stupid of course , because in our country it is the British who decide how an Indian lives what he may buy , what he may sell . And from their luxury in the midst of our terrible poverty they instruct us on what is justice and what is sedition . So it is only natural that our best young minds assume an air of Eastern dignity , while greedily assimilating every Western weakness as quickly as they can acquire it .
NEHRU: If we have Home Rule that will change .
GANDHI: Would you , please ?
NEHRU: I thought you were against fighting . They have reached the trough .
GANDHI: Just spread it around they like the new peelings mixed with the otting ones .
BA: The fire is ready .
GANDHI: You see , even here we live unde tyranny .
NEHRU: I told you
FIRST FRIEND: Hm but look at him . Some `` fighter '' ! I can see the British shaking now .
BA: But it 's the ink that is the most diffic
SHUKLA: I am looking for Mr. Gandhi
ENGLISH CAPTAIN: Clear the way there ! Get out of the way !
SERGEANT PUTNAM: Sir ! Up here !
ENGLISH CAPTAIN: Give me a leg up , will you !
SERGEANT PUTNAM: I do n't know , sir . The agent says they got a telegram and it just said , he is coming and gave the time of the train .
ENGLISH CAPTAIN: Who the hell is he ?
SERGEANT PUTNAM: I do n't know , sir .
ENGLISH CAPTAIN: Who the devil are you ?
GANDHI: My name is Gandhi . Mohandas K. Gandhi .
ENGLISH CAPTAIN: Well , whoever you are , we do n't want you here . I suggest you get back on that train before it leaves the station .
GANDHI: They seem to want me .
ENGLISH CAPTAIN: Now look here . I 'll put you unde arrest if you 'd prefer ?
GANDHI: On what charge ?
ENGLISH CAPTAIN: I do n't want any trouble .
GANDHI: I am an Indian traveling in my own country . I see no reason for trouble .
ENGLISH CAPTAIN: Well , there 'd better not be .
MEHA: For years the landlords have ordered us to grow indigo , for dyeing the cloth . Always they took part of the crop as rent .
GANDHI: I understand . The landlords are British ? It 's a rhetorical question . Meha nods .
SHUKLA: Yes , Bapu The whole province hundreds thousands .
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Mohan !
POLICEMAN: Are you Mr. M. K. Gandhi ?
GANDHI: Yes .
POLICEMAN: I 'm sorry but you are under arrest .
GANDHI: I am not sorry at all .
BATSMAN: Who did you say would be buying the drinks ?
MAJOR: I 've got no idea . All I know is there 's a riot or something at Motihari in Champaran , and the whole company is ordered out .
A VOICE: It 's two days ' march !
MAJOR: That 's why the match is off . It 's mostly Muslim territory and the old man 's taking no chances .
BATSMAN: God , and it 's the best innings I 've had since Oxford .
WICKET KEEPER: India 's full of grief , old man .
CHARLIE: I wish to see the prisoner , please .
CAPTAIN: All right , Sergeant .
GANDHI: Charlie
CHARLIE: Shades of South Africa .
GANDHI: Not quite . They 're only `` holding me '' until the Magistrate 's hearing . Then it will be prison .
CHARLIE: Did they take your clothes ?
GANDHI: These are my clothes now .
CHARLIE: You always had a puritanical streak , Mohan .
GANDHI: If I want to be one with them , I have to live like them .
CHARLIE: I think you do . But I thank God we all do n't . And Gandhi laughs .
GANDHI: I 'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine .
CHARLIE: Ah , but my puritanism runs the anothe way . I 'm far too modest for such a display .
GANDHI: It does . We must be getting old , Charlie .
CHARLIE: What do you want me to do ?
GANDHI: I think , Charlie , that you can help us most by taking that assignment you 've been offered in Fiji .
CHARLIE: I must leave from Calcutta , and soon . You 'll have to say goodbye to Ba fo me .
GANDHI: When I get the chance .
CHARLIE: Well , I
GANDHI: There are no goodbyes for us , Charlie . Wherever you are , you will always be in my heart
MAGISTRATE: I am going to clear the courtroom .
CLERK: I 'm not sure we 'd be able to . And it is a first hearing , it 's supposed to e public . And he 's a lawyer . The magistrate frowns .
MAGISTRATE: I do n't know where they found the nerve for all this .
CLERK: I 'm sure I do n't either , but the troops wo n't be here until tomorrow .
MAGISTRATE: How the press get here before the military ?
CLERK: That English clergyman sent a numbe of telegrams yesterday afternoon . I understand one of them even went to the Viceroy .
MAGISTRATE: You have been ordered out of the province on the grounds of disturbing the peace .
GANDHI: With respect , I refuse to go .
MAGISTRATE: Do you want to go to jail ?
GANDHI: As you wish .
MAGISTRATE: All right . I will release you on ail of one hundred rupees until I each a sentence .
GANDHI: I refuse to pay one hundred rupees .
MAGISTRATE: Then I I will grant release without ail until I reach a decision .
A VOICE: Gandhiji ! Gandhiji ! Mr. Gandhi !
GANDHI: Indeed .
SIR GEORGE: I do n't know what this country is coming to !
SIR EDWARD: But good God , man , you yourself raised the rent simply to finance a hunting expedition !
SIR GEORGE: Nobody knows what it is to try to get these people to work !
SIR EDWARD: Well , you 've make this half-naked whatever-he-is into an international hero .
SIR GEORGE: What do they want ?
PERSONAL SECRETARY: A rebate on rents paid . They are to be free to grow crops of their own choice . A commission part Indian to hear grievances .
SIR GEORGE: That would satisfy him ?
SIR EDWARD: And His Majesty 's Government . It only needs your signature for the landlords .
SIR GEORGE: It will be worth it to see the back of him . We 're too damn liberal . Sir Edward is at the liquor cabinet .
SIR EDWARD: Perhaps . But at least all this has made the Government see some sense about what men like Mr. Gandhi should e allowed , and what they should be denied .
JINNAH: Where is Mr. Gandhi ?
CHAUFFEUR: He said he preferred to walk , sir . I followed him most of the way . He 's just turned the corner .
JINNAH: The Prophet give me patience .
CHAUFFEUR: He came Third Class .
JINNAH: My house is honored . Gandhi grins , dismissing the formality .
GANDHI: The honor is ours . May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach . He 's an old friend and his interest is in flowers . I presumed to tell him he could wande your gardens while we talked .
JINNAH: I 'll send my gardener . I 'm sure you 'll have much to discuss .
GANDHI: Only the stubborn man of Champaran . A polite little laugh ; Jinnah introduces him .
JINNAH: Mr. Patel you know . Mr. Maulana Azad a fellow Muslim ecently released from prison .
GANDHI: I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru .
PATEL: Well , I 've called you here because I 've had a chance to see the new legislation . It 's exactly what was umored . Arrest without warrant . Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious He looks at Gandhi .
KRIPALANI: So much for helping them in the Great War
JINNAH: There is only one answer to that . Direct action on a scale they can never handle !
NEHRU: I do n't think so .
JINNAH: I too have read Mr. Gandhi 's writings , ut I 'd rather be ruled by an Indian terrorist than an English one . And I do n't want to submit to that kind of law .
PATEL: I must say , Panditji , it seems to me it 's gone beyond remedies like passive esistance .
GANDHI: If I may I , for one , have neve advocated passive anything .
AZAD: And what `` resistance '' would you offer ?
GANDHI: The law is due to take effect from April sixth . I want to call on the nation to make that a day of praye and fasting .
JINNAH: You mean a general strike ?
GANDHI: I mean a day of prayer and fasting . But of course no work could be done no buses , no trains , no factories , no administration . The country would stop .
PATEL: My God , it would terrify them
AZAD: Three hundred fifty million people at prayer . Even the English newspapers would have to report that . And explain why .
KRIPALANI: But could we get people to do it ?
NEHRU: Champaran stirred the whole country . They are calling you Mahatma the Great Soul .
GANDHI: Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live .
NEHRU: I think if we all worked to publicize it all of the Congress every avenue we know .
JINNAH: Perhaps I should have stayed in the garden and talked about the flowers .
ADC: Sir it 's Mr. Kinnoch . Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly .
CHELMSFORD: Yes ?
KINNOCH: Nothing nothing is working , sir uses trains the markets There 's not even any civilian staff here , sir Everything has stopped .
CHELMSFORD: Is it simply Delhi and Bombay ?
KINNOCH: No , sir Karachi , Calcutta , Madras , Bangalore . It 's , it 's total . He glances at the general .
CHELMSFORD: I ca n't believe it
KINNOCH: He 's going to sell his own pape tomorrow in Bombay . They 've called for a parade on Victoria Road .
CHELMSFORD: Arrest him !
NEHRU: Bapu
GANDHI: You too He means `` Bapu '' `` Father . ''
NEHRU: It seems less formal than `` Mahatma . ''
GANDHI: Maybe I 'm wrong maybe we 're not eady yet . In South Africa the numbers were small
NEHRU: The Government 's afraid , and they do n't know what to do . But they 're more afraid of terrorists than of you . The Viceroy has agreed to you elease if you will speak for non- violence .
GANDHI: I 've never spoken for anything else .
SPEAKER: England is so powerful its army and its navy , all its modern weapons but when a great powe like that strikes defenseless people it shows it brutality , its own weakness ! Especially when those people do not strike back . That is why the Mahatma begs us to take the course of non-violence !
DYER: Port arms , Sergeant Major .
SPEAKER: Our pain will be our victory .
ADC: Do we issue a warning , sir ?
DYER: They 've had their warning no meetings . It is final .
SERGEANT MAJOR: Take aim !
DYER: Fire !
SERGEANT MAJOR: Reload !
DYER: Take your time . Take your time . He looks off at the crowd . His eyes narrow .
CORPORAL: Sir !
DYER: Over there . He nods . The corporal looks .
CORPORAL: Sir .
ADVOCATE: General Dyer , is it correct that you ordered your troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowd ?
DYER: That is so .
ADVOCATE: One thousand five hundred and sixteen casualties with one thousand six hundred and fifty bullets .
DYER: My intention was to inflict a lesson that would have an impact throughout all India .
INDIAN BARRISTER: General , had you been able to take in the armored car , would you have opened fire with the machine gun ? Dyer thinks about it . Then unashamedly
DYER: I think , probably yes .
HUNTER: General , did you realize there were children and women in the crowd ?
DYER: I did .
ADVOCATE: But that was irrelevant to the point you were making ?
DYER: That is correct .
ADVOCATE: Could I ask you what provision you made for the wounded ?
DYER: I was ready to help any who applied .
ADVOCATE: General how does a child shot with a 3-0-3 Enfield `` apply '' fo help ?
CHELMSFORD: You must understand , gentlemen , that His Majesty 's Government and the British people repudiate both the massacre and the philosophy that prompted it .
GANDHI: If you will excuse me , You Excellency , it is our view that matters have gone beyond `` legislation . ''
KINNOCH: With respect , Mr. Gandhi , without British administration , this country would be reduced to chaos .
GANDHI: Mr. Kinnoch , I beg you to accept that there is no people on earth who would not prefer their own bad government to the `` good '' government of an alien power .
BRIGADIER: My dear sir India is British ! We 're hardly an alien power ! Gandhi and the others just look at him .
CHELMSFORD: Even if His Majesty could waive all other considerations , he has a duty to the millions of his Muslim subjects who are a minority in this realm . And experience has taught that his troops and his administration are essential in order to keep the peace .
GANDHI: All nations contain religious minorities . Like other countries , ours will have its problems . But they will be ours not yours .
GENERAL: And how do you propose to make them yours ? You do n't think we 're just going to walk out of India .
GANDHI: Yes in the end you will walk out . Because one hundred thousand Englishmen simply can not control three hundred fifty million Indians if the Indians refuse to co-operate . And that is what we intend to achieve peaceful , non-violent , non-co- operation .
GENERAL: `` You do n't just expect us to walk out ? '' `` Yes . '' And they all laugh .
BRIGADIER: Extraordinary little man ! `` Nonviolent , non-co-operation '' for a moment I almost thought they were actually going to do something .
CHELMSFORD: Yes but it would be wise to be very cautious for a time . The Anti- Terrorist Act will remain on the statutes , but on no account is Gandhi to be arrested . Whatever mischief he causes , I have no intention of making a martyr of him . It is an instruction they all find correct .
BA: but now something worse is happening . When Gandhiji and I were growing up , women wove their own cloth . But now there are millions who have no work because those who can buy all they need from England . I say with Gandhiji , there is no eauty in the finest cloth if it makes hunger and unhappiness .
GANDHI: My message tonight is the message I have given to your brothers everywhere . To gain independence we must prove worthy of it .
PATEL: Excuse me just let me get out of your way , please . No , thank you , I 'll manage .
KALLENBACH: I do it as a friend and admirer not a servant .
PATEL: Ah , in that case !
KALLENBACH: Yes . Now that things are moving he 's going to write and only take part when it 's necessary . Azad approaches them .
AZAD: It was a Hindu child and it tried to wet on me .
PATEL: Of course . A Muslim beef eater I 'm only surprised he missed .
AZAD: He was a she .
PATEL: Ah , that explains it . Well , do I carry your luggage as penance or
KALLENBACH: There 's another passenger a Miss Slade . She 's the daughter of an English admiral . She 's been corresponding with him for a year .
PATEL: And what does the daughter of an English admiral propose to do in an ashram sink us ?
AZAD: From the looks of the luggage , yes .
KALLENBACH: She wants to make her home with us and Gandhiji has agreed .
MIRABEHN: You 'd be Mr. Kallenbach . Kallenbach recovers sufficiently to
KALLENBACH: And you would be Miss Slade .
MIRABEHN: I prefer the name Gandhiji has given me Mirabehn .
KALLENBACH: It was a gift and it only worked a few weeks , but when Gandhi came home he struck on this idea . He calls it his ox-Ford . Comfortable and yet more our pace .
MIRABEHN: Might Mr. Nehru be there too ?
PATEL: The irresponsible young Nehru is in prison again . Though there is a umor that under pressure from you country , they will let him out again .
MIRABEHN: You ca n't know how closely we follow your struggle how many in England admired what you did in Bardoli . It must have taken enormous courage .
PATEL: Well , in this country one must decide if one is more afraid of the government or Gandhi . For us , it 's Gandhi .
MIRABEHN: And you 're German
KALLENBACH: Yes .
MIRABEHN: And do you feel Indian ?
KALLENBACH: No . It surprises , but it does n't deflate .
MIRABEHN: But you 've been with him so long why ?
KALLENBACH: I 'd come to believe I would neve meet a truly honest man . And then I met one .
BA: Stop stop
GANDHI: Eleven .
PATEL: It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day .
GANDHI: Not true ! The secret is mastering the urge .
AZAD: He came Second Class .
GANDHI: Well , we ca n't expect miracles all the time . Your news I understand is not so good . Azad shakes his head .
AZAD: No .
GANDHI: Come , come you will be my daughter
AZAD: but then some rioting broke out etween Hindus and Muslims violent , terrible
GANDHI: Is the campaign weakening ? Azad shakes his head .
AZAD: The marches and protests are bigge if anything but with the censorship here they know more in England than we do , and it saps the courage to think you may be suffering alone . Gandhi reaches out and touches his hand .
GANDHI: They are not alone . And martial law only shows how desperate the British are .
MIRABEHN: I I sent for it , from here . I dyed it myself . Gandhi smiles approvingly . Then a shadow
GANDHI: What do the workers in England make of what we 're doing ? It must have produced hardship . Mirabehn beams .
MIRABEHN: It has . But you 'd be surprised . They understand they really do . It 's not the workers you have to worry about .
GANDHI: Good . Ba will have to teach you to spin too .
MIRABEHN: I would rather march .
GANDHI: First spin . Let the others march fo a time .
BA: First lesson To march , wear shoes , to spin , do not .
MARCHERS: Home Rule ! Long live Gandhi ! Buy Indian ! Long live Gandhi !
POLICEMAN: I 'll stuff your damn mouth with it !
SECOND MARCHER: Leave him alone he was n't harming you !
POLICEMAN: Hey
PATEL'S VOICE: That 's one bit of news they have n't censored .
JINNAH'S VOICE: Oh , it 's all over the world India 's `` non-violence . ''
NEHRU: What can we do ?
GANDHI: We must end the campaign .
JINNAH: After what they did at the massacre it 's only an eye for an eye .
GANDHI: An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind . We must stop .
PATEL: Gandhiji do you know the sacrifices people have made ?
JINNAH: We would never get the same commitment again ever .
GANDHI: If we obtain our freedom by murde and bloodshed I want no part of it .
NEHRU: It was one incident .
GANDHI: Tell that to the families of the policemen who died .
NEHRU: Bapu the whole nation is marching . They would n't stop , even if we asked them to .
GANDHI: I will ask . And I will fast as penance for my part in arousing such emotions and I will not stop until they stop .
JINNAH: God ! You can be sure the British wo n't censor that ! They 'll put it on every street corner .
NEHRU: But but Gandhiji people are aroused they wo n't stop .
GANDHI: If I die , perhaps they will
BA: I must get ready for evening prayers . Mirabehn is here .
MIRABEHN: I 've brought your drinking water . May I turn you ?
GANDHI: When it is everywhere , then my prayers will be answered . Mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability .
MIRABEHN: I do n't know I know you are right . I do n't know that this is right .
GANDHI: When I despair , I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won .
MIRABEHN: Panditji come in . She stands , moving back from Gandhi .
NEHRU: Jinnah , Patel , all of Congress has called for the end of non-co- operation . There 's not been one demonstration . All over India people are praying that you will end the fast . They 're walking in the streets , offering garlands to the police and to British soldiers .
GANDHI: Perhaps perhaps I have overdone it .
LITTLE BOY: Good morning , Bapu !
GANDHI: Good morning . Do n't let her go . If she bumps me I am done for . The boy grins at Gandhi 's feigned alarm .
LITTLE BOY: Do n't worry . I milk her every day , she 's not
NEHRU: You ca n't be serious ! This man has just stopped a revolution !
GANDHI: Panditji please , help me .
CLERK: Call the prisoner to the bar .
ADVOCATE GENERAL: `` Non-co-operation has one aim the overthrow of the Government . Sedition must become our creed . We must give no quarter , nor can we expect any . '' Signed M. K. Gandhi , in your journal Young India , dated twenty-second March of this year . Do you deny writing it ?
GANDHI: Not at all . And I will save the Court 's time , M'Lord , by stating under oath that to this day I believe non-co-operation with evil is a duty . And that British ule of India is evil .
ADVOCATE GENERAL: The Prosecution rests , M'Lord .
JUDGE BROOMFIELD: I take it you will conduct your own defense , Mr. Gandhi .
GANDHI: I have no defense , My Lord . I am guilty as charged . And if you truly believe in the system of law you administer in my country , you must inflict on me the severest penalty possible .
JUDGE BROOMFIELD: It is impossible for me to ignore that you are in a different category from any person I have ever tried , or am likely to try .
COLLINS: Well , he certainly was n't forgotten ! And as soon as he got out he was ack tramping the country , preaching non-violence and demanding a free India . Everybody knows anothe showdown 's coming but when , and over what He shrugs , `` Nobody knows ''
WALKER: Well , I read you account of that crowd in Calcutta and that he was twisting the Lion 's tail again
COLLINS: How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway ?
WALKER: Oh , I 've been a Gandhi buff for a long time .
COLLINS: He certainly makes good copy . The other day Winston Churchill called him `` that half-naked Indian fakir . '' Walker smiles too , but it soon passes .
WALKER: I met him once . Collins looks at him in real surprise .
COLLINS: You mean Gandhi ?
WALKER: Back in South Africa long time ago .
COLLINS: What was he like ?
WALKER: Lots of hair and a little like a college freshman trying to figure everything out .
COLLINS: Well , he must 've found some of the answers
BA: `` In every worthy wish of yours , I shall be your helpmate . ''
GANDHI: `` Take a fourth step , that we may be ever full of joy . ''
BA: `` I will ever live devoted to you , speaking words of love and praying for your happiness . '' Close shot Gandhi .
GANDHI: `` Take a fifth step , that we may serve the people . ''
BA: `` I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people . ''
GANDHI: `` Take a sixth step , that we may follow our vows in life . ''
BA: `` I will follow you in all our vows and duties . '' Ba and Gandhi . Near to meeting now .
GANDHI: `` Take the seventh step , that we may ever live as friends . ''
BA: `` You are my best friend my highest guru , and my sovereign lord . ''
GANDHI: Then I put a sweetened wheat cake in her mouth .
BA: And I put a sweetened wheat cake in his mouth .
GANDHI: And with that we were pronounced man and wife . We were both thirteen
WALKER: It 's beautiful .
GANDHI: Even as a boy I thought so .
WALKER: Trying to keep track of you is making me change all my sleeping habits . Gandhi smiles .
GANDHI: And you 've come all this way because you think something is going to happen ?
WALKER: Hm . Is it ?
GANDHI: Perhaps . I 've come here to think about it .
WALKER: A great deal .
GANDHI: I 've traveled so far and thought so much . As you can see , my city was a sea city always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians . The temple where you were yesterday is of my family 's sect , the Pranami . It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita , moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped .
WALKER: You know what you 're going to do . Gandhi looks at him , a teasing smile .
GANDHI: It would have been very uncivil of me to let you make such a long trip for nothing .
WALKER: Where are you going ?
GANDHI: I 'm going back to the ashram and then I 'm going to prove to the new Viceroy that the King 's writ no longer runs in India !
IRWIN: Salt ?
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY: Yes , sir . He is going to march to the sea and make salt .
IRWIN: All right he 's breaking the law . What will he be depriving us of , two upees of salt tax ?
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY: It 's not a serious attack on the evenue , sir . Its primary importance is symbolic .
IRWIN: Do n't patronize me , Charles . The principal secretary blanches .
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY: No , sir . I in this climate , sir , nothing lives without water o salt . Our absolute control of it is a control on the pulse of India .
IRWIN: And that 's the basis of this `` Declaration of Independence '' ?
GENERAL: I say ignore it . Let them raise thei damn flags , let him make his salt . It 's only symbolic if we choose to make it so .
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY: He 's going to arrive at the sea on the anniversary of the massacre at Amritsar .
IRWIN: General Edgar is right ignore it . Mr. Gandhi will find it 's going to take a great deal more than a pinch of salt to bring down the British Empire .
GANDHI: the real test will come if I am arrested . If there is violence we lose all our moral advantage . This time it must n't happen .
NEHRU: We 're not beginners anymore . We 've een trained by a strict sergeant major .
GANDHI: If I 'm taken , Maulana is to lead the march . If he is arrested , Patel , then Kripalani , then yourself .
BA: You should be relaxing .
GANDHI: I 'm sure I 'm fit for at least five hundred miles .
MIRABEHN: You should ride the pony . It is not necessary to walk to prove the point . Gandhi looks at Nehru , a benign shrug .
GANDHI: I have two of them bossing me now .
NEHRU: We must get these to the printer . I know it will succeed . Even my mothe is prepared to march . Gandhi is pleasurably impressed with that .
GANDHI: And Jinnah ?
NEHRU: He 's waiting . He 's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think .
GANDHI: Wait and see wait and see
WALKER: It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing .
GANDHI: Not if they arrest me or a thousand or ten thousand . It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns .
WALKER: What if they do n't arrest you ? What if they do n't react at all ?
GANDHI: Do you still have your notebook ? The function of a civil resister is to provoke response . And we will continue to provoke until they espond , or they change the law . They are not in control we are . That is the strength of civil esistance .
COLLINS: What 'd he say ?
WALKER: He said he 's in charge
GANDHI: Are you going to walk all the way ?
WALKER: My name is Walk-er . And I intend to eport it the way it is .
GANDHI: `` My name is Walk-er ''
STUDENT LEADER: We 've come to join the march . What do we do ?
PYARELAL: Be sure you 're awake in the morning . Find a place to sleep .
BRIGADIER: We 're being made fools of around the world !
GENERAL: Is n't there any instruction from London ? Irwin nods .
IRWIN: We 're required to stop it . And stop it we will . I do n't care if we fill the jails , stop it . Arrest anyone , any rank except Gandhi . We 'll cut his strength from under him . And then we 'll deal with the Mahatma . For the first time he is truly angry .
BRITISH SUBALTERN: Oh , my God !
SUBALTERN: Right jump to it clear this each !
NEHRU: No violence , Zia !
SERGEANT: You 're Nehru
NEHRU: I 'm an illegal trader in salt . The sergeant sighs grimly .
IRWIN: Who 's leading them ?
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY: Has there been any violence ?
IRWIN: I believe the question was intended to discover if there was any violence of their side .
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY: Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi , it might
IRWIN: He 's addressed this letter directly to you , has he ?
AZAD: I would like admission to the Works .
WALKER: Hello ! Ed ! Ed ! Goddammit , do n't cut me off ! Ed ! Okay yeah right .
GANDHI: I am aware that I must have given you much cause for irritation , you Excellency . I hope it will not stand etween us as men .
IRWIN: Mr. Gandhi , I have instructions to equest your attendance at an All- Government Conference in London to discuss to discuss the possible Independence of India . He faces Gandhi stiffly . The whirr of a camera , and a swift cut to
MACDONALD: I think our first duty is to recognize that there is not one India , but several a Hindu India , a Muslim India , and India of Princely States . And all these must be respected and cared for not just one .
GANDHI: Do I speak into that ?
GANDHI'S VOICE: I think your interest and the world 's has fallen on India , not only because we are struggling for freedom , but ecause the way we are doing so is unique as far as history shows us . Here in Europe mighty nations are , it seems , already contemplating another war , though I think they , and all the world , are sick to death of bloodspilling . All of us are seeking a way out , and I flatte myself that perhaps the ancient land of India will offer such a way . If we are to make progress we must not epeat history , but make history . And I myself will die before I betray our belief that love is a stronge weapon than hate .
GANDHI: It is only a sprain . Take her to the iver , and we 'll make a mud-pack fo her . Go I wo n't be long . He turns back .
JINNAH: So the truth is , after all you travels , all your efforts , they 've stopped the campaign and sent you home empty-handed .
GANDHI: They are only clinging to old dreams and trying to split us in the old way . But the will has gone Independence will drop like a ripe apple . The only question is when and how .
NEHRU: I say when is now and we will determine how .
JINNAH: Precisely .
GANDHI: They are preparing for war . I will not support it , but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger .
PATEL: That 's when you take advantage .
GANDHI: No . That is just another way of striking back . We have come a long way together with the British . When they leave we want to see them off as friends . And now , if you 'll excuse me , there is something I must attend to .
NEHRU: `` Mud packs . ''
BRITISH COLONEL: Mr. Gandhi sir .
GANDHI: The value of goat 's milk in daily diet . But you can be sure I will also speak against war .
BRITISH COLONEL: I 'm sorry , sir . That ca n't be allowed .
ADJUTANT: It 's all right , Mrs. Gandhi . I have orders to return with you and you companion to the Mahatma 's ashram .
BA: If you take my husband , I intend to speak in his place .
LIEUTENANT: It was the Aga Khan 's palace , but they 've turned it into a prison .
GANDHI: Yes , I have heard of Life Magazine . I have even heard of Margaret Bourke- White . But I do n't know why eithe should be interested in an old man sitting in prison when the world is lowing itself to pieces .
BA: not at all . Bapu has always said there were two kinds of slavery in India one for women , one for the untouchables and he has always fought against both .
MAJOR: I 've got permission to move her he can go too . The doctor shakes his head .
DOCTOR: She 's had a coronary throm a serious heart failure . She would n't survive a trip . It 's best to leave her and hope .
GANDHI: It is time for my walk I wo n't be long .
MOUNTBATTEN: We have come to crown victory with friendship to assist at the birth of an independent India and to welcome her as an equal member in the British Commonwealth of Nations . I am here to see that I am the last British Viceroy ever to have the honor of such a reception .
JINNAH: I do n't give a damn for the independence of India ! I am concerned about the slavery of Muslims !
GANDHI: Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India . No one will be slave , no one master .
JINNAH: The world is not made of Mahatma Gandhis . I am talking about the real world .
NEHRU: The `` real India '' has Muslims and Hindus in every village and every city ! How do you propose to separate them ?
JINNAH: Where there is a Muslim majority that will be Pakistan . The rest is your India .
PATEL: Mohammed the Muslims are in a majority on two different sides of the country .
JINNAH: Let us worry about Pakistan you worry about India .
MOUNTBATTEN: Gentlemen , perhaps we should ecommence .
GODSE: Death to Jinnah ! Death to Jinnah !
GANDHI: Thank God , they 've stopped .
HINDU YOUTH: Bapu please . Do n't do it !
GANDHI: What do you want me not to do ? Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah ? I am a Muslim ! And a Hindu , and a Christian and a Jew and so are all of you . When you wave those flags and shout you send fear into the hearts of you others .
JINNAH: Now , please , if you 've finished you prayers , could we begin with business .
GANDHI: My dear Jinnah , you and I are brothers orn of the same Mother India . If you have fears , I want to put them to rest . I am asking Panditji to stand down . I want you to be the first Prime Minister of India to name your entire cabinet , to make the head of every government department a Muslim .
NEHRU: Bapu , for me , and the rest , if that is what you want , we will accept it . But out there already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away .
PATEL: If you did this , no one could control it . No one .
JINNAH: It is your choice . Do you want an independent India and an independent Pakistan ? Or do you want civil war ? Gandhi stares at him numbly .
KALLENBACH: Tomorrow . Tomorrow photograph him .
NEHRU: No . There just are not that many troops .
MILITARY AIDE: What 's he to do ?
NEHRU: What he can !
PATEL: Have you found him ? Nehru nods solemnly .
NEHRU: He 's in Noakhali .
NEHRU'S VOICE: What you have done in Noakhali is a miracle , Bapu , a miracle , but millions are on the move millions . There is no way to stop it and no one can count the dead . The camera angle has changed . We are in
NEHRU: In Calcutta it 's like civil war . The Muslims rose and there was a loodbath , and now the Hindus are taking revenge and if we ca n't stop it there 'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan .
PATEL: an eye for an eye making the whole world blind .
AZAD: Are n't there any troops to spare ?
NEHRU: Nothing nothing . The divisions in Bombay and Delhi can hardly keep the peace now . And each fresh bit of news creates another wave of mad ness .
PATEL: Could we cut all news off ? I know
NEHRU: Bapu please . Where are you going .
GANDHI: I do n't want to hear more
PATEL: We need your help !
GANDHI: There is nothing I can give .
AZAD: Where are you going ? Gandhi turns , looks at him bleakly .
GANDHI: Calcutta .
POLICE COMMISSIONER: Sir , please , I do n't have the men to protect you not in a Muslim house . Not this quarter .
GANDHI: I am staying with the friend of a friend .
A YOUTH: There he is !
GANDHI: Because forgiveness is the gift of the brave .
YOUTH: To hell with you , Gandhi ! ! An angry chorus of acclamation ; when it dies
GANDHI: Go do as your mother and fathe would wish you to do .
WOMAN: Bapu Allah be with you There are tears in Gandhi 's eyes now .
GANDHI: And with you . Pray I can not help you pray pray .
NEHRU: No ! There will not be a Hindu Police and a Muslim Police . There is one police !
THE AIDE: Four days ? Nehru thinks on it solemnly , then nods yes .
NEHRU: Bapu
GANDHI: Sardar You have gained weight . You must join me in the fast .
PATEL: If I fast I die . If you fast people go to all sorts of trouble to keep you alive .
NEHRU: Bapu , forgive me I 've cheated . I could have come earlier . But you fast has helped . These last days people 's minds have begun to turn to this bed and away from last night 's atrocity . But now it is enough . Gandhi shakes his head .
GANDHI: All that has happened is that I 've grown a little thinner .
NEHRU: Tomorrow five thousand Muslim students of all ages are marching here in Calcutta for peace . And five thousand Hindu students are marching with them . It is all organized .
GANDHI: I 'm glad but it will not be enough .
NEHRU: Bapu , you are not so young anymore .
GANDHI: Do n't worry for me death will be a deliverance . I can not watch the destruction of all I have lived for .
MIRABEHN: Bapu
GANDHI: Each night before I sleep , I read a few words from the Gita and the Koran , and the Bible tonight I ask you to share these thoughts of God with me .
MIRABEHN: `` Lead Kindly Light , amidst the circling gloom ''
NEHRU: Who dares say such things ! Who ? ! Come ! Kill me first ! Come ! Where are you ? ! Kill me first !
MIRABEHN: His pulse is very irregular the kidneys are n't functioning .
NEHRU: Bapu , I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy . It was he who called on the Muslims to rise ; he is telling them now to go back to their homes , to lay down their arms .
GANDHI: That the fighting will stop that you make me believe it will neve start again . Nehru looks at him hopelessly .
NEHRU: Sometimes it is when you are quite without hope and in utter darkness that God comes to the rescue . Gandhiji is dying because of our madness . Put away your `` revenge . '' What will be gained by more killing ? Have the courage to do what you know is right . For God 's sake , let us embrace like others
GOONDA LEADER: It is our promise . We stop . It is a promise .
GANDHI: Go try God by with you .
NAHARI: Eat .
GANDHI: Only God decides who goes to hell
NAHARI: I I killed a child I smashed his head against a wall . Gandhi stares at him , breathless .
GANDHI: Why ? Why ?
NAHARI: They killed my son my boy !
GANDHI: I know a way out of hell .
CONSTABLE: Yes , sir , yes , sir , `` Wait . ''
SERGEANT: I would n't have believed it , Mr. Gupta .
SENIOR OFFICER: Sergeant , it 's a bloody miracle
MIRABEHN: Bapu , there 's been no fighting anywhere . It has stopped the madness has stopped .
GANDHI: It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man .
MIRABEHN: No no . In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other .
PATEL: Everywhere .
GANDHI: Maulana , my friend , could I have some orange juice Then you and I will take a piece of bread together
NEHRU: You see , Bapu , it is not difficult . I have fasted only a few hours and I accomplished what you could not do in as many days .
GANDHI: That is how you eat muli .
PATEL: No , he 'll be remembered for tempting fate .
ABHA: Mickey Mouse .
GANDHI: I 'm simply going to prove to Muslims there , and Hindus here , that the only devils in the world are those unning around in our own hearts and that 's where all our battles ought to be fought .
MIRABEHN: He thinks he 's failed .
GANDHI: Allah be with you .
MANU: Brother , Bapu is already late fo prayers .
GANDHI: Oh , God oh , God
GANDHI'S VOICE: There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible . But in the end they always fall . Think of it always When you are in doubt that that is God 's way , the way the world is meant to be think of that .
DIVINCI: Says here they got slips in Honolulu . 325 a month . Utilities included . That 's not bad . Rodriguez sits down .
RODRIGUEZ: I do n't know how you do it .
DIVINCI: What ?
RODRIGUEZ: How you can think about Hawaii now ?
DIVINCI: My heart 's in Hawaii .
RODRIGUEZ: You never been there . How can you heart be there .
DIVINCI: You 're tellin ' me there 's no place you 'd rather be other than here ?
RODRIGUEZ: No , I 'm saying I just do n't know how you can think about Hawaii right now .
DIVINCI: If I was in Hawaii right now , I would n't be thinking about here . See the difference ?
RODRIGUEZ: No .
DIVINCI: Look , I 'm not in Hawaii , I 'm here . But I do n't want to be here , I want to be in Hawaii . I ca n't be in Hawaii , therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being here .
RODRIGUEZ: But I 'm here , I know I 'm here , I do n't like being here , but I ca n't e anyplace else because I look around and I see all this shit . How do you get around that ? ! That 's what I 'm asking .
DIVINCI: Focus .
RODRIGUEZ: Focus . Divinci nods . Rodriguez looks at his watch .
DIVINCI: Aloha .
RODRIGUEZ: Aloha my ass .
CYNTHIA: Left at the corner .
DIVINCI: Hope you do n't mind me checkin ' you for weapons .
HUDD: Hell yes I mind . Divinci hesitates . This could break the deal .
DIVINCI: Okay . Check him .
HUDD: Lotta good hidin ' places on this ody . Check good .
CYNTHIA: He 's got nothin ' .
HUDD: Not bad , not bad . Any more where this came from ?
DIVINCI: Maybe .
HUDD: Then maybe we talk again .
DIVINCI: Maybe .
HUDD: Told you there was a lotta good hidin ' places on this body .
RODRIGUEZ: Come on ! Hurry up !
CYNTHIA: Hey , Joe , wake up . Get outa the street efore you get run over . Joe , wake up !
DIVINCI: Got your money .
CYNTHIA: Put it on the table .
DIVINCI: Tired ?
CYNTHIA: Yes .
DIVINCI: I 'm not .
CYNTHIA: Take a sleeping pill . There 's some in my purse .
DIVINCI: You want your money ?
CYNTHIA: I already worked for that . Divinci unzips his pants .
DIVINCI: This is a bonus .
CYNTHIA: For who ?
DIVINCI: This ai n't my fault . This is a failure of our educational system . If you had n't fallen through the cracks and dropped outa school , you would n't be here now .
CYNTHIA: So what 's your excuse ?
DIVINCI: I 'm in love .
VIC: Keepin ' some late hours . Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme .
RODRIGUEZ: What the hell you doin ' ? What 're my neighbors gon na think ?
VIC: I apologize . I understand you concerns . But you must understand that , unlike a bank , I can not rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one 's debts . I am forced to employ the likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme , whom I might add , contributes significantly to my overhead . I am the real loser here . And I am concerned about you sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand , nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due . What can you do to eassure me of your good intentions ?
RODRIGUEZ: I can make your life fuckin ' miserable that 's what I can do .
VIC: Look at me . Do I have a wife and three kids ? Do I have a good job at IBM ? Am I a handsome guy ? No , no and no . I loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who ca n't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs , too . The point of which is , I already have a fuckin ' miserable life . So do n't threaten me you lousy ag of cat shit .
RODRIGUEZ: Four thousand is all I got .
VIC: I am proportionally reassured . You purchased yourself an extension .
RODRIGUEZ: Cutless Supreme , what kind of fuckin ' idiot name is that ?
CUTLESS SUPREME: It was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital , but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain . I was born in the back seat .
PATROLMAN MAHONEY: Another day , another body . Where you wan na start ?
FIRST MAN: A hit ?
PATROLMAN MAHONEY: Looks like . Could be gang related .
RODRIGUEZ: Any witnesses ?
PATROLMAN MAHONEY: Oh , sure , hundreds .
DIVINCI: Fuckin ' Animals .
FIRST DETECTIVE: three shotgun shells , twelve gauge . The Desk Officer checks in the evidence .
DESK OFFICER: Three shotgun shells , twelve gauge .
DIVINCI: One less drug store on the street .
DESK OFFICER: And the world is a safer place .
RODRIGUEZ: a green car you know what make Maybe a Ford , uh-huh . You did n't see the license , did you ?
DIVINCI: Wan na go for a ride ?
RODRIGUEZ: You think you could describe the driver ? You bought it ?
DIVINCI: As of last night , I 've got the down . Just picture me under swayin ' palms with a Mai Tai .
RODRIGUEZ: Uh-huh . You 're gon na buy it , no shit . When ?
DIVINCI: Just a phone call away . Divinci picks up the phone , starts to dial .
RODRIGUEZ: That 's really great , man .
CAPT. HENDERSON: You got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th .
DIVINCI: I 'm workin ' it up now .
CAPT. HENDERSON: Who 's your second ? In my office . Both of you .
DIVINCI: Why ?
CAPT. HENDERSON: Now .
RODRIGUEZ: What the hell Divinci motions `` keep calm . ''
CAPT. HENDERSON: Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez , this is Richard Simms . He 's with the D.E.A . He wants to ask you some questions about your case .
DIVINCI: What 's the occasion ?
SIMMS: You get an i.d . on the victim ?
RODRIGUEZ: We 're waitin ' for prints . Divinci pulls out his note pad .
DIVINCI: Car was registered to
SIMMS: Anchor Imports . 81 El Dorado . Black .
DIVINCI: If you got all this , what d'you want from us ?
SIMMS: The man in the car is Lionel Hudd .
RODRIGUEZ: How d'you know that ? What 's goin ' on here ?
SIMMS: Hudd was DEA , undercover .
DIVINCI: We 'll do everything we can to help .
DIVINCI: Calm down !
DIVINCI: SHUT UP !
RODRIGUEZ: FUCK , FUCK , FUCK !
DIVINCI: Shut up and listen to me ! Rodriguez glares up at Divinci .
RODRIGUEZ: No fuckin ' reason to panic ? Did you say no fuckin ' reason to panic !
DIVINCI: Stop being an idiot ! We 're the cops on the case . It 's our case . We are going to find the fuckin ' killers .
DIVINCI: Since when does that matter ? !
RODRIGUEZ: We killed a cop , does n't that bothe you ?
DIVINCI: Of course it bothers me . What d'you want me to do , turn myself in ? Well I 'm not . That 's the risk we take everyday , somebody might pop us , especially undercover like that . So he got popped . It happens .
RODRIGUEZ: Not by other cops !
DIVINCI: I patted him down ! He was n't wearin ' a wire , he had no badge , no gun , how was I supposed to know ? ! A moment of silence , then
RODRIGUEZ: What 're you talkin ' about , are you sayin ' we stick somebody with this ?
DIVINCI: Evidence points wherever we want it to point . Shit , we can provide so much evidence , even the asshole we pick will think he fuckin ' killed him .
RODRIGUEZ: You got some asshole in mind ?
DIVINCI: Just do n't worry . We 'll find a killer . There 's lots of 'em out there .
JAMES: What the hell 'd I do now ?
DIVINCI: Never is , is it .
JAMES: That ai n't my fuckin ' gun .
DIVINCI: Got your fuckin ' prints on it .
RODRIGUEZ: Where were you Friday night ?
JAMES: Friday night last Friday night ?
RODRIGUEZ: Where were you ?
JAMES: Whatever you think I did went down last Friday night ?
DIVINCI: Better have a good alibi , James , o it 's good ali bye-bye . A beat , then James smiles .
JAMES: I was in jail you assholes . Check it out . All night . What a couple a dickheads ! Rodriguez and Divinci are silent .
CORTEZ: Ai n't my gun .
RODRIGUEZ: Got your prints on it .
CORTEZ: You fuck , I ai n't never seen that gun before !
RODRIGUEZ: Where were you last Friday night ?
CORTEZ: Fuck you . I wan na talk to a lawyer ! Just want they wanted to hear . No alibi .
RODRIGUEZ: Lawyer 's not gon na help you , Cortez . All the evidence we got points right to you . Cortez stares at them for a moment , then
CORTEZ: Did you say last Friday night ?
DAVE: Alright , alright , alright shit . I ai n't gon na fight you .
RODRIGUEZ: That 's what they all say .
DAVE: Wish it was . No better gun than Smitty and Wes .44 mag with serial numbers filed off . Got any bullets ?
DIVINCI: Where were you last Friday night ?
DAVE: You mean , what 's my alibi right ?
DIVINCI: Montrose LaJolla
RODRIGUEZ: We pulled him in last year for knifing that dealer on 32nd .
DIVINCI: Yeah . Almost killed him , remember ? He 'd be good . ( calls out to ANOTHER
DETECTIVE: Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla ?
ANOTHER DETECTIVE: He 's dead . His life partner killed him in a Domestic D about a month ago . Rodriguez suddenly slams his book shut .
RODRIGUEZ: Shit !
DIVINCI: Take it easy .
RODRIGUEZ: This is n't gon na work ! Divinci leans toward Rodriguez .
DIVINCI: Nobody said it was gon na be easy . But let 's not advertise our despair Okay ? The PHONE RINGS . Divinci picks it up .
CAPT. HENDERSON: It 's been three days .
DIVINCI: We 're not fuckin ' magicians ! What the hell is three days ? ! This is a goddamn murder case ! It takes a little it of goddamn time !
CAPT. HENDERSON: When a Federal Undercover Office goes down , it 's never a fuckin ' murde case ! I do n't like the DEA on my ass any better than you like 'em on yours . But this is personal for them and they want answers . Forget your othe cases and get something , anything that I can give to them . The last thing I want is the goddamn F.B.I . on my back , too .
DIVINCI: We 've got a couple leads . We need a little more time .
CAPT. HENDERSON: I ca n't hold 'em off much longer .
RODRIGUEZ: This is no fuckin ' way to run an investigation .
CAPT. HENDERSON: Let me tell you both something , if you do n't solve this quick , they 're gon na start askin ' why ? And they 'll e lookin ' to blame somebody in this department . So my advise to you is , get something fuckin ' fast or turn over what you 've got and get outa the way .
DIVINCI: How much time we got ?
CAPT. HENDERSON: A couple days . The funeral 's this afternoon .
RODRIGUEZ: What funeral ?
CAPT. HENDERSON: For Agent Hudd . Simms wants you there .
DIVINCI: What for ? We did n't know him .
CAPT. HENDERSON: How the hell do I know ? ! It 's DEA , it 's their thing . You 're the cops on the case , I suppose they want you to know what a great guy Hudd was so you 'll work all that harder to find his killer . Just go . It 'll reassure 'em how much you care and keep 'em off my ass .
REVEREND: and it is too easy to say that he was a good man in his job because he gave more than most . And it 's too easy to say that he was a good man in his community because he gave more than others . And it 's too easy to say he was a good man at home with his family because he was always there when they needed him . Special Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a good man , he was an extraordinary man . And his death shall not be in vain .
DIVINCI: Do n't Humpty Dumpty on me .
RODRIGUEZ: What 's that mean ?
DIVINCI: Your cracks are startin ' to show .
RODRIGUEZ: Bullshit . Divinci sees Simms approaching from the side .
DIVINCI: Get your balance . Here comes the King .
SIMMS: Glad you came Anything break ? Divinci glances at Rodriguez .
DIVINCI: Nothin ' to brag about . But we 've got a couple new leads we 're followin ' .
SIMMS: Look , normally we 'd be all ove this , but your Captain seems to think you can do the job . It 's you territory . I guess you know it bette than anybody . And that can be worth a lot . But you understand we wo n't wait forever . Divinci is pissed . He does n't like Simms .
DIVINCI: Just outa curiosity What happened to his backup ? You guys use backup on undercover do n't you ?
SIMMS: It was a new lead . Hudd was afraid ackup would blow his cover . He was supposed to check in ten minutes after the deal went down . He neve checked in .
RODRIGUEZ: We want this one as bad as you do . A cop 's a cop . We 're in this together , ight ?
SIMMS: That 's why I asked you to come here . Just so you knew that .
DIVINCI: He did n't have backup . You believe that ? ! Jesus what a dick .
RODRIGUEZ: I do n't think we should criticize that particular decision of his .
DIVINCI: I do n't care what the reasons are , you do n't play Lone Fuckin ' Range on a drug buy . You 're just askin ' for it . That 's all I 'm sayin ' .
RODRIGUEZ: I do n't trust those bastards . They 're not waitin ' for us . That 's bullshit . They 're runnin ' their own investigation . I know it !
DIVINCI: Let 'em . The gun , the coke came from evidence . The car came from impound . So what 's to find ?
RODRIGUEZ: That 's what I 'm afraid of . There 's nothing for them to find . We were too good .
DIVINCI: So what 're you worried about ?
RODRIGUEZ: Nobody is that fuckin ' good . Divinci looks at Rodriguez , then smiles .
DIVINCI: Except us .
CYNTHIA: I think this is breaking and entering , is n't it ?
DIVINCI: I work homicide , I do n't deal with that shit .
CYNTHIA: Learn anything you did n't already have on file ?
DIVINCI: Yeah . You surprise me sometimes . Here I think you 're just a hard case and I discover you 've got a heart of gold . You 're an organ donor . That 's really nice . The only problem is , they 'll never use your best parts .
CYNTHIA: I 'll make sure you get them .
DIVINCI: Hey , do n't get me wrong . I was just surprised that we had something in common Besides what we have in common .
CYNTHIA: Do everybody a favor , if you 're gon na donate your heart , make sure it goes to science . Most people want one that beats .
DIVINCI: Cynthia pretty name . What do the first three letters spell ?
CYNTHIA: Do n't get so clever . It 's out of character .
DIVINCI: Nothing .
CYNTHIA: Then why 's it got all your attention ?
DIVINCI: I 'm thinkin ' , that 's all .
CYNTHIA: About us ?
DIVINCI: No .
CYNTHIA: Good . Divinci looks at Cynthia .
DIVINCI: What if I was thinkin ' about us ?
CYNTHIA: Do n't waste your time .
DIVINCI: What if I was ?
CYNTHIA: Where 's it gon na get us ?
DIVINCI: Maybe I got plans .
CYNTHIA: I do n't wan na hear 'em . Plans just make you think somethin 's gon na get etter . I 'm fine now . I do n't need to get screwed up waitin ' fo something good to happen .
DIVINCI: I just want you to know , love is important to me .
CYNTHIA: Me , too .
DIVINCI: But more important is loyalty . Nothing is more important than that . Not love , not anything . Because loyalty is about respect . You can talk about love all you want , but without respect it 's empty . I mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect . And once it 's gone , forget the love . So I am telling you , I am loyal to you . Like I 'm loyal to my partner . We are closer than blood . And I trust him with my life .
CYNTHIA: Why 're you telling me this ?
DIVINCI: When you asked if I was thinkin ' about us and I said I was n't , I just want you to know that I do . A beat , then
CYNTHIA: Just do n't ask me to marry you .
DIVINCI: Why are n't more women like you ? Divinci leans in and they kiss .
DIVINCI'S VOICE: What 's your name ?
DIVINCI: Your name , what 's your name ?
WILLIAM: Joe
DIVINCI: Where 'd you get the gun , Joe ?
WILLIAM: I do n't know .
DIVINCI: Sure you do , Joe . Everybody needs protection . Especially a guy like you lives on the street , right ? Joe just stares at the gun .
WILLIAM: I do n't
DIVINCI: You will .
RODRIGUEZ: Who the hell is this ?
DIVINCI: Is that any way to answer the phone ?
RODRIGUEZ: Divinci , shit ! It 's quarter to six .
DIVINCI: I know what time it is , I 'm not the one in bed . I need the photos of the scene .
RODRIGUEZ: Now ?
DIVINCI: I got a suspect . But he ca n't remembe all the details . He needs a little help . And I thought , since you 're my partner , you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin ' hand . Rodriguez sits up in bed .
RODRIGUEZ: He does n't remember last Friday ?
DIVINCI: He does n't remember a lotta Fridays . Bring the shots and pick up a fifth of Vodka . Make it two .
RODRIGUEZ: Why 'd you kill him ?
WILLIAM: I do n't know
RODRIGUEZ: It was your gun .
WILLIAM: I do n't have a gun .
DIVINCI: Yes you do . In your pocket .
WILLIAM: I 'm tired .
DIVINCI: I know , Joe , it 's tough to remembe things you do n't wan na remember . What about your last name , Joe . You got a last name ?
RODRIGUEZ: Come on , Joe , everybody 's got a last name .
WILLIAM: I do n't remember .
RODRIGUEZ: Do n't fuck with us , Joe . We 're trying to help you . What 's your last goddamn name ? Joe shakes his head .
WILLIAM: I do n't know .
DIVINCI: Come on , we 're all tired here , Joe . Just give us your last name .
WILLIAM: I do n't remember .
DIVINCI: Okay , fine , what 's in a name ? But you remember the gun , right , in you pocket . Joe nods .
WILLIAM: Yeah . Divinci looks at Rodriguez . Rodriguez nods .
DIVINCI: How 'd it happen , Joe , tell me how it happened . You saw him driving toward you
WILLIAM: I saw him driving toward me
RODRIGUEZ: Then what did you do ?
DIVINCI: You ran .
JOE'S VOICE: I did n't mean to
WILLIAM: He was going to hit me I was scared he was going to hit me . Rodriguez looks at Divinci .
DIVINCI: That 's why you shot him .
WILLIAM: That 's why I
JOE'S VOICE: shot him .
DIVINCI: Helluva nice shot , Joe .
CYNTHIA: It 's the middle of the day .
DIVINCI: Just talk .
CYNTHIA: Since when ?
DIVINCI: I need you to do something .
CYNTHIA: Good , I need the money .
DIVINCI: This is n't a deal . Where you goin ' ?
CYNTHIA: I got perishables , okay ?
DIVINCI: The guy we did the last deal with is dead . Cynthia turns suddenly .
CYNTHIA: What ?
DIVINCI: Somebody popped him that night , probably when he tried to unload the stuff . I do n't know .
CYNTHIA: Jesus , does anybody
DIVINCI: Do n't worry , there 's no connection . We got the guy who did it . Cynthia breathes a sigh of relief .
CYNTHIA: You scared the hell outa me .
DIVINCI: We just need you to do one thing .
CYNTHIA: What ?
DIVINCI: He 'll be third from the left . Do n't fuck up . Third from the left .
CYNTHIA: What 'm I supposed to say ?
DIVINCI: Just look at 'em and then look at the man the third from the left and say , It 's him .
RODRIGUEZ: And I 'll say , Are you sure ?
DIVINCI: And you say , Absolutely . No question .
CYNTHIA: This is all I need to do right ?
DIVINCI: We have a signed confession . You i.d . him , he 's goin ' straight into the can .
CYNTHIA: Okay , okay . But this is it . I 'm not doin ' anything more than this .
DIVINCI: Hey , it 's a done deal .
A VOICE: Stop and face front .
THE VOICE: Lift your heads , look straight .
DIVINCI: Take your time . Try and remember his face .
CYNTHIA: I know him .
DIVINCI: If you can identify the man
CYNTHIA: I know him .
DIVINCI: Just tell us which one . Cynthia , frustrated , gives Divinci a look .
CYNTHIA: No . I fucking know him .
RODRIGUEZ: What 's the problem ?
DIVINCI: There 's no problem ! Do you see him up there ? !
CYNTHIA: You do n't understand .
THE VOICE: No talking .
DIVINCI: Pick the asshole out !
CYNTHIA: Third man from the left .
DIVINCI: You mind telling me what that was all about ? !
CYNTHIA: I know him . He hangs around my uilding . He lives in the alley o something .
DIVINCI: You do n't think people that hang around your neighborhood can kill somebody . Well let me tell you something . You do n't live in a great fuckin ' neighborhood . Divinci pulls a paper from his pocket .
CYNTHIA: What paper ?
RODRIGUEZ: You picked a man out of a lineup , you have to sign that you did that so they do n't think we made it up .
CYNTHIA: Now why the hell would they think something like that ?
DIVINCI: Sign it .
CYNTHIA: You said all I had to do was pick him out .
DIVINCI: This is part of it . Just sign it and you 're done .
CYNTHIA: How come you 're so sure it was him ? Rodriguez rolls his eyes .
RODRIGUEZ: Jesus Christ !
DIVINCI: He confessed .
CYNTHIA: Bullshit .
RODRIGUEZ: We got it in writing .
CYNTHIA: He did n't do it .
DIVINCI: How the hell d'you know that ? Were you with him at the time ? ! You have a good goddamn alibi for him ? !
RODRIGUEZ: Maybe she was blowing him !
CYNTHIA: Better him than you .
DIVINCI: Take it easy .
RODRIGUEZ: Fine , I got nothin ' at stake here .
DIVINCI: This is what they call an open and shut case . He did the kill and he 's going down . Do n't make the mistake of thinking you know the right thing to do .
SIMMS: Doe ?
RODRIGUEZ: He would n't give us his last name .
SIMMS: He signed a confession but he would n't give you his last name ?
DIVINCI: He said he could n't remember it . He 's a head case .
AGENT HOOPER: You run prints ?
RODRIGUEZ: No priors .
AGENT SARKASIAN: Ballistics match ?
RODRIGUEZ: We 're waiting . But a forty-four was used in commission . He had a forty- four on him .
AGENT HOOPER: It went down pretty quick .
DIVINCI: It 's our street .
CAPT. HENDERSON: I think they did a helluva job .
SIMMS: Goddammit !
CAPT. HENDERSON: Do me a favor . Make sure this one sticks . I do n't want the D.E.Assholes ack in here .
GUARD: Word is he killed a DEA undercover Word is he shot him in the face Word is he signed a confession .
ELLIOT: Word is everyone 's entitled to a defense no matter how guilty they are .
DOCTOR: He 's detoxing . I gave him something to help him through it .
ELLIOT: Can I talk to him ?
HELEN: when the defendant , Clyde Dunner , entered the house of George and Carol Beaman on Friday night , a .44 calibe pistol in his hand . He entered the house with one thing in mind . To kill George and Carol , the people he lamed for the break up of his marriage to Carol 's sister , Paula .
JUDGE WEINBERG: The defense may now proceed .
RICHARD STEIN: Jesus Christ !
YOUNG MAN: I do n't know where ?
RICHARD STEIN: Are you sure ?
YOUNG MAN: They looked all over
HELEN: What 's wrong ?
RICHARD STEIN: They ca n't find the murder weapon .
HELEN: What 're you talking about ?
RICHARD STEIN: Dunner 's .44 . They ca n't find the goddamn gun !
YOUNG MAN: They lost it or something . Misplaced it , I do n't know . They ca n't find it anywhere .
HELEN: What ? !
RODRIGUEZ: The Dunner gun , you used the fucking Dunner gun ? !
DIVINCI: This is not my fuck up ! Our shooting was supposed to be gang-related and unsolved ! Only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence ! Otherwise , we never woulda needed it . So do n't point your finger at me !
RODRIGUEZ: Alright , alright But how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody ? !
DIVINCI: We do n't explain it . It 's not ou fault they lost the evidence . Ballistics are already complete in Dunner 's case . All we need is anothe gun .
RODRIGUEZ: What ?
ELLIOT: Joe , I 'm Elliot , we met the other well , you were n't in very good shape . You look much better . Joe just stares at Elliot .
WILLIAM: About what I did .
ELLIOT: Yes .
WILLIAM: Okay . Okay ? Not the answer Elliot was looking for .
ELLIOT: What about Doe ? Is that what you told the officers your last name was ?
WILLIAM: I do n't think so .
ELLIOT: What did you tell them your last name was ?
WILLIAM: I do n't remember .
ELLIOT: Well , is Doe your last name ?
WILLIAM: I 'm not sure .
ELLIOT: Do you know what your last name is ?
WILLIAM: I do n't remember .
ELLIOT: Joe , I 'm your attorney , I 'm here to help you . It does n't matter if you give the court your last name o not , they will still put you on trial . Do you understand ?
WILLIAM: Yes .
ELLIOT: So there 's no reason to try and hide your identity . What is your last name ?
WILLIAM: I would tell you if I could remember .
ELLIOT: Joe Smith , Joe Jones , Joe DiMaggio
WILLIAM: I do n't think so .
ELLIOT: Okay . Look , we 'll move on . You understand the charges against you . They 're serious . And if you are found guilty , you could go to prison for a very long time .
WILLIAM: Maybe I should .
ELLIOT: What ?
WILLIAM: Go to prison . I killed him . I did n't mean to . But he was going to hit me .
ELLIOT: Yes , I know , I read your confession . Joe , if you really felt your life was in danger , we might be able to use self-defense as our argument . But before we get into that Do you have any family , Joe ? Any friends ?
WILLIAM: I do n't think so .
ELLIOT: Joe do you know what a psychiatrist is ?
WILLIAM: Yes .
ELLIOT: Have you ever seen a psychiatrist ?
WILLIAM: I 'm not sure .
ELLIOT: Joe , you do n't remember much about yourself .
WILLIAM: No .
ELLIOT: but you remember the night you shot the man in the car .
WILLIAM: Yes .
ELLIOT: Why ?
WILLIAM: because I can I 'm sorry , I 'm not much help .
HELEN: and when you approached the suspect in his apartment , did you identify yourself as a police officer ?
DIVINCI: Yes .
HELEN: Did the suspect respond ?
DIVINCI: Yes , he did ?
HELEN: In what way ?
DIVINCI: He started shooting through the door .
HELEN: The Defendant fired six times , until his gun was empty . We would like to show you the weapon he used .
HELEN: The prosecution would like to call Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand .
BAILIFF: Steven J. Allen .
HELEN: Mr. Allen , would tell the court what you do .
CLYDE: That ai n't my gun .
JUDGE WEINBERG: I must remind the defendant that he is not to speak out when
CLYDE: That ai n't my gun !
RODRIGUEZ: We got ta put the right gun back .
DIVINCI: We ca n't put the right gun back ! Without that gun , they wo n't convict Joe .
RODRIGUEZ: Without that gun they wo n't convict Clyde !
DIVINCI: I 'm not worried about Clyde , I 'm worried about us !
RODRIGUEZ: Look , Joe 's never goin ' to trial , ight . He signed a goddamn confession ! Like you said , this one is open and shut . Clyde 's the one we got ta worry about . We ca n't let him go back on the street ! He 's a fuckin ' psychopath . He 'll kill somebody again .
DIVINCI: Shit . How the hell did that piece of puke know it was n't his fuckin ' gun ? ! I do n't think he knows his own fuckin ' mother , but he knows his fuckin ' gun !
RODRIGUEZ: I do n't think that 's important right now .
DESK OFFICER: Sorry , Divinci , ca n't do it .
DIVINCI: What d'you mean you ca n't do it ? I got ta check something .
DESK OFFICER: You got ta get written permission from the Chief .
RODRIGUEZ: Since when ? !
DESK OFFICER: Since an hour ago when he came down here and chewed me a new asshole igger than a three car garage .
DIVINCI: What 's the problem ?
DESK OFFICER: Something about missing evidence o who the hell knows . I just wan na transfer the hell outa here .
DIVINCI: What the hell 're we supposed to do ? !
DESK OFFICER: Ask the chief . Policy ai n't my department !
ELLIOT: We would like to plead not guilty to the charge of murder at this time for reason of Insanity .
WILLIAM: But I did it . Elliot turns to Joe .
ELLIOT: Yes , Joe . Let me handle this .
WILLIAM: But I signed the confession .
ELLIOT: Yes , Joe . Do n't worry about it . I 'm the attorney .
HELEN: Your honor , can we have a moment ?
ELLIOT: I do n't agree .
HELEN: If he wants to plead guilty , you have to let him plead guilty .
ELLIOT: Not if he 's not of sound mind .
HELEN: Come on , Elliot !
ELLIOT: I think he 's crazy . I know you think he 's just putting it on , that 's D.A . standard procedure , but I do n't think he is . So , your honor , I 'm standing y the not guilty because I believe he 's incapable of making that judgment .
DIVINCI: Nobody can connect us to the evidence thing we 're clean there . Rodriguez is quiet .
RODRIGUEZ: You know we ca n't do it anymore .
DIVINCI: yeah , I guess .
RODRIGUEZ: No , we 're through . That 's it .
DIVINCI: Good while it lasted though . A hundred grand apiece . Not bad for a few nights work .
RODRIGUEZ: I just wan na get through this .
DIVINCI: We 're gon na get through it . No evidence problems on this one .
RODRIGUEZ: I hope not I do n't know , Frank , lately I been thinkin ' maybe what we did was n't such a good idea .
DIVINCI: Hey , we took out a few scumbags , that 's it . Nobody 's ever gon na miss those shitheels . They were all pieces of garbage . Not one of 'em had a sheet less than a mile long . Drugs , extortion , assault . They were all fuckin ' guilty as hell and still on the street , you know that .
RODRIGUEZ: Except the cop .
DIVINCI: Yeah , except the cop . That 's part of the job . Could just as easily have happened to you or me .
RODRIGUEZ: But we 're cops , you know ? We fucked up .
DIVINCI: We fucked up once . Once outa ten . That 's not bad . I 'm sorry , okay ? I 'm sorry . He was in the wrong place at the wrong time , what can I say . I 'm not goin ' down for it .
RODRIGUEZ: I know .
DIVINCI: Look , if we got paid a decent salary we would n't be tempted by this , right ? And what happens when we retire ? You think our pension 's gon na take care of us ? Shit no . We are on our own . I mean all I want in life is a goddamn fishing boat , a beach , a couple drinks and some Hawaiian fuckin ' music . That ai n't much for twenty years putting murdering assholes behind ars . I mean , the dealers , the pimps , the killers , they got no rules . We got all the fuckin ' rules . It ai n't fair . That 's all I 'm sayin ' , it ai n't fair For awhile , we made it fair . Rodriguez downs his scotch .
RODRIGUEZ: Do you think we 're corrupt ?
DIVINCI: Hey , I never took a fuckin ' bribe in my life .
RODRIGUEZ: Me either .
DIVINCI: Nobody ever bought me .
RODRIGUEZ: I know .
DIVINCI: No fuckin ' way . Even the thought makes me sick . And what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt . It 's two completely different things . Do n't get 'em confused .
RODRIGUEZ: I guess you 're right .
DIVINCI: I 'm telling you . It 's nothin ' to do with corrupt .
RODRIGUEZ: I 'm worried , that 's all .
DIVINCI: Hey , you got ta worry a little . It 's natural . Just do n't lose your sense of humor .
RODRIGUEZ: My sense of humor , right .
DIVINCI: The problem with people is , nobody gives a shit about makin ' the world a better place . You and me , I do n't care what anybody says , we made the world a better place . No matter what happens . There are ten less drug dealin ' assholes on the street today ecause of us . They 're not plea argainin ' their way back onto the street , they 're not clogging up the courts , and they 're not costing the tax payers a fuckin ' penny because they 're not in prison . They were garbage . And there 's nothin ' wrong with takin ' out the garbage .
RODRIGUEZ: So , you think you 'll get back with Caroline ?
DIVINCI: Shit . Nothin ' I ever do is good enough , you know ?
RODRIGUEZ: Never is , never was , never will be .
DIVINCI: Guess I got ta make the effort . It 's gon na cost me if I do n't .
RODRIGUEZ: Tell me about it . You know how much I got left .
DIVINCI: You 're gon na think I 'm an idiot , ut I like Cynthia . There 's no ullshit with her . I just fuckin ' like her .
RODRIGUEZ: I think you just like fuckin ' her .
DIVINCI: Yeah , that , too .
CYNTHIA: What the hell , Joe , at least you wo n't get run over .
JUDGE WEINBERG: The defendant will stand and face the jury . Clyde stands .
JUDGE: What is your verdict ?
JURY FOREMAN: We find the defendant , Clyde David Dunner , not guilty .
CLYDE: Fuckin ' A !

ELLIOT: Hi , Joe . You 're looking much better .
WILLIAM: I guess jail 's been good for me . Elliot nods , motions for Joe to take a chair .
ELLIOT: Trial date 's been set for Thursday .
WILLIAM: I 've been thinking about what I did and I do n't think it 's right that I try getting off .
ELLIOT: Excuse me ?
WILLIAM: I want to plead guilty . I killed a man and I should be punished .
ELLIOT: I 'm a little surprised .
WILLIAM: Why ?
ELLIOT: Nobody ever wants to be punished fo what they 've done . It 's just a new concept . But I still think our defense is reasonable . I do n't believe , unde the condition you were in , that you were responsible for your actions .
WILLIAM: But why was I carrying a gun ? I had no right to carry a gun .
ELLIOT: If you had n't been carrying the gun , you might be dead .
WILLIAM: And he might be alive .
ELLIOT: I understand Can I think about this ?
WILLIAM: No . I 've made up my mind . Elliot stares at Joe for a beat , then we
RODRIGUEZ: What if she takes off ?
DIVINCI: Then we got no goddamn witness puts him at the scene .
RODRIGUEZ: And what happens if she testifies and nobody fuckin ' believes her ?
DIVINCI: Perjury , maybe . But that 's a fifty fifty . They might believe her .
RODRIGUEZ: Shit , Frank , she 's a goddamn strippe for Chrissake , who 's gon na believe her . I do n't believe her when she 's telling the truth !
DIVINCI: What ?
OFFICER: Ahh , we got two bodies out here and three more in the house .
DIVINCI: So ?
OFFICER: I was just wondering if you were gon na be the primary on this one , that 's all .
DIVINCI: Yeah , yeah , we 're comin ' . Just give us some room .
RODRIGUEZ: She could blow the whole thing . She could tie us in and that would be it . We 'd be fuckin ' fried .
DIVINCI: If it looks like she 's gon na crumble we 'll take steps .
RODRIGUEZ: What steps ? Divinci looks at Rodriguez .
DIVINCI: One more chalk outline more or less in this city who 's gon na know ?
RODRIGUEZ: Oh shit , Frank .
DIVINCI: Hey , hey , you think I like this ? !
RODRIGUEZ: We just ca n't go around killin ' everybody !
DIVINCI: Just a second . Look around . Whatta we got here ? Two stiffs on the street , shot to shit , three more inside . That 's five chalk lines in one night in one deal in one neighborhood in one city . Let me fill you in on some statistics , we 're not killin ' everybody . Look , this is strictly last resort . Okay ? But let 's not kid ourselves . If push comes to shove , somebody has to go down . If you got anothe candidate , I 'm willin ' to listen .

MANNY: Sure , Detective . Always like to help out the police whenever possible !
RICHARD STEIN: Is n't that Arthur Baylor ? Helen turns .
HELEN: Yes .
RICHARD STEIN: What 's he doing here ?
HELEN: What the hell ?
BAILIFF: Hear ye , hear ye . All rise , face ou flag and recognize the principles for which it stands . The Criminal Court , Department G is now in session . The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding .
ARTHUR: Yes , your honor . I have joined the defense in the representation of Mr. William Dane McCall , otherwise known to this court as Joe Doe .
HELEN: I do n't believe so , your honor .
NEWSCASTER: when it was discovered that the man who has confessed to killing an undercover DEA agent , was actually himself thought dead for seven years . The man who signed the confession as Joe Doe is actually William Dane McCall , brother of Nathan McCall . Both are sons of the founder of McCall International , a corporation involved in telecommunications , computer design and development and other related industries . The net worth of both men is estimated at over a billion dollars
RODRIGUEZ: but William McCall shunned the usiness world and turned his life to medicine , receiving his medical degree from Harvard in 1969 . Once again he turned his back on the established norm and spent several years in Africa performing organ transplants for the poor . Rodriguez slams down the paper .
DIVINCI: He was living in the fuckin ' street ! How the hell was I supposed to know he was a goddamn doctor ? !
RODRIGUEZ: He 's not a goddamn doctor ! You picked a fuckin ' Saint to pin a fuckin ' murder on !
DIVINCI: he disappeared seven years ago on September 19 two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young children in a multiple vehicle accident . At the time it was assumed that he had returned to Africa , but that was never confirmed . What William McCall has been doing for seven years is now the mystery that the court will try to help unravel . Divinci closes the paper .
RODRIGUEZ: Are you asking me if I can think of something worse than what we 've done that we can still do , or something worse that might happen to us if this all blows up and we are convicted and sent to jail and die in the electric chair and go to hell ? Divinci looks at Rodriguez .
DIVINCI: Work with me here .
RODRIGUEZ: I 'm sorry . I 'm a little on edge . Would you repeat the question ? Both men are quiet for a moment , then
DIVINCI: Even if the doc walks , there 's no evidence ties us to it . There 's only one person who can connect us to Hudd .
RODRIGUEZ: Okay , fine , I do n't wan na argue about it anymore . Let 's just fuckin ' kill her .
DIVINCI'S VOICE: We need to talk .
MANNY: Are you fuckin ' with me ?
DIVINCI: No , I 'm not fuckin ' with you . Are you fuckin ' with me ? !
MANNY: You do n't know ?
DIVINCI: Know what ?
MANNY: Well this is a good one . You 're a cop and you do n't know .
DIVINCI: Stop it .
MANNY: Cops got her . Ai n't that a gas . Cops got her , you 're a cop , and you got ta find out from me . It 's a crazy world we live in , do n't you think ?
DIVINCI: Cops ? ! What fuckin ' cops ? !
MANNY: I do n't know what fuckin ' cops . All I know is , my people got to he sister 's place and she was already gone . Her sister said some cops took her . I thought it was you !
SECRETARY: What an asshole . Manny looks down at his Secretary .
MANNY: You 're a good judge of character .
DIVINCI: look , she 's our witness , if she 's in custody , somebody better tell me !
RODRIGUEZ: Nothin ' . Nobody knows nothin ' . The D.A . thinks she 's gone . D.E.A . does n't know shit .
DIVINCI: If she was bein ' held by police , we 'd know .
RODRIGUEZ: Unless she said somethin ' .
DIVINCI: If she said something we would n't be sittin ' here . I think it 's that lyin ' piece of shit .
DUNCAN: First trial , huh .
WILLIAM: Yes .
DUNCAN: I got one piece of advise . When you eak for lunch , do n't get the pastrami . We HEAR the BARRED CELL DOOR open .
GUARD: Time to go .
BAILIFF'S VOICE: The Criminal Court , Department G is now in session . The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding . Please be seated and come to order .
HELEN: when he pulled this gun and fired at the driver of the car . Killing him instantly . Let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime , a Smith and Wesson forty-fou caliber handgun .
RICHARD STEIN: All these goddamn guns are startin ' to look the same to me .
HELEN: And when you arrested the defendant , did he deny that he had killed Agent Hudd .
DIVINCI: No .
HELEN: Can you describe the defendant 's condition at the time of his arrest .
DIVINCI: He was drunk . We could smell the ooze on him . But we drew blood . He did n't object .
HELEN: We have the blood test report that shows that he had four times the legal limit to drive . The people would like to enter this into evidence . They so enter it .
ELLIOT: and you arrested the defendant four days after the killing . What lead you to suspect Mr. McCall ?
RODRIGUEZ: You ask questions . Work the neighborhood . Find out who was on the street that night .
ELLIOT: Yes , but specifically Mr. McCall ? He had no previous criminal record .
RODRIGUEZ: We found someone who 'd seen him in the area . So we picked him up fo questioning . We did n't expect it to e him . But if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk to him . If he was n't the killer , he might 've seen the killer . Just outine really .
ELLIOT: Where did you find the defendant ?
RODRIGUEZ: On the street . Corner of Third and Madison .
ELLIOT: What was he doing ?
RODRIGUEZ: He was passed out .
ELLIOT: But you knew it was the man you were looking for .
RODRIGUEZ: Yes .
ELLIOT: Based on what ?
RODRIGUEZ: His description .
ELLIOT: Who provided you with the description ?
RODRIGUEZ: Cynthia something , I think .
ELLIOT: I believe her name is Cynthia Webb . According to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the line- up . The name familiar ?
RODRIGUEZ: Yes that 's her .
ELLIOT: Where did you find Ms Webb ?
RODRIGUEZ: On the street . Same area .
ELLIOT: And she agreed to pick the defendant out of a line up .
RODRIGUEZ: Yes .
ELLIOT: Where you aware that Ms We disappeared after she was served with a subpoena ?
RODRIGUEZ: Yes , my partner and I tried to contact her about the case and were unsuccessful .
ELLIOT: Thank you , Detective , that 's all the questions I have . Rodriguez gets up as we
DIVINCI: To justice in all its forms . Rodriguez picks up his glass .
RODRIGUEZ: We 're not home free yet .
DIVINCI: Without Ms Webb , there 's no place they can go . We still got the confession , the gun , the ballistics And I do n't give a shit about all this African doctor crap the man is a drunk and he 's been a drunk fo seven goddamn years . So lets have a drink for drunks .
RODRIGUEZ: Yeah .
DIVINCI: Life do n't work in mysterious ways . There ai n't no mystery to it . You just work it . And you do n't take it too serious . You ca n't take it too serious otherwise you get fragile . And you ca n't be fragile and have any fuckin ' fun .
RODRIGUEZ: You think I 'm fragile ?
DIVINCI: That 's the first sign of trouble , when you start askin ' other people . Rodriguez nods .
RODRIGUEZ: I just wish I knew where the hell she was .
RICHARD STEIN: so I think we 'll have to rely on the confession for his description of what happened . He 'll never take the stand , even if The phone rings . Richard picks up .
HELEN: Where ?
RICHARD STEIN: I do n't know .
HELEN: When ?
RICHARD STEIN: I do n't know .
HELEN: Well who the hell was that ?
RICHARD STEIN: I do n't know . They hung up .
HELEN: What the fuck is going on ? !
BAILIFF: Raise your right hand .
CYNTHIA: Sure .
BAILIFF: You may be seated . Cynthia sits down . Looks at Divinci .
WILLIAM: I know her .
ELLIOT: She 's the woman who identified you .
WILLIAM: No . I mean I know her .
ARTHUR: How ?
WILLIAM: I 'm not sure I think I lived nea her .
HELEN: Please state your name for the court .
CYNTHIA: Cynthia Webb .
HELEN: Do you see the man that you identified in a police line-up in this room .
CYNTHIA: Yes .
HELEN: Is it the defendant , Mr. McCall ?
CYNTHIA: Yes .
HELEN: Please describe what you saw the night of September 14th .
CYNTHIA: I was comin ' out of an all night minimart
HELEN: And you 're positive the man you saw with the gun is the defendant .
CYNTHIA: Yeah .
HELEN: No further questions . Divinci offers her a small smile .
ARTHUR: Miss Webb is it Miss ?
CYNTHIA: Yes .
ARTHUR: Miss Webb , had you ever seen the defendant before that night , the night you described to us ?
CYNTHIA: No .
ARTHUR: Do you know what perjury is ?
CYNTHIA: When you lie .
ARTHUR: When you lie under oath in a court of law . Do you know what the penalty for that is ?
CYNTHIA: You go to jail .
ARTHUR: Yes Cynthia , have you ever seen the defendant before that night ?
HELEN: Objection . The witness has already answered that question .
ARTHUR: I just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else efore the night in question .
CYNTHIA: Yes .
ARTHUR: What did you buy the night you went into the mini-mart ?
CYNTHIA: What did I buy ?
ARTHUR: You remembered seeing Mr. McCall that night and hearing the gunshot and a car crash . I just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini-mart .
CYNTHIA: shampoo I think .
ARTHUR: That 's all ?
CYNTHIA: Yes .
ARTHUR: Where do you live ?
CYNTHIA: 4356 17th Street . Number 37 .
ARTHUR: Is that close to where this mini- mart is ?
CYNTHIA: Close ? Sort of .
ARTHUR: How far would you say ?
CYNTHIA: I do n't really know .
ARTHUR: Within walking distance ?
CYNTHIA: No I do n't think so .
ARTHUR: Did you walk there that night o drive ?
CYNTHIA: I ahh drove .
ARTHUR: You drove . But when you left the mini-mart you stated that you walked down the street .
CYNTHIA: Yeah .
ARTHUR: How far ?
CYNTHIA: to the corner .
HELEN: Objection . Your honor , I do n't see a point to this line of questioning .
ARTHUR: Yes , your honor . Since this is the only witness , I 'm trying to establish what the scene was like that night .
CYNTHIA: In the middle I think .
ARTHUR: So you walked all the way to the corner . I assume then you were walking ack to your car , yes ?
CYNTHIA: yeah .
ARTHUR: Was there a reason you parked so fa away ?
CYNTHIA: Um there were lots of cars parked on the street .
ARTHUR: Was there anyone else on the street esides you ?
CYNTHIA: No .
ARTHUR: Lots of cars , but no people . Any traffic ?
CYNTHIA: I do n't remember .
ARTHUR: So you were the only person to see Joe on the street that night ?
CYNTHIA: I did n't see anybody else .
ARTHUR: So you heard a gunshot , a car crash and a man running with a gun in his hand .
CYNTHIA: Yes .
ARTHUR: What did you do then ? Did you call the police , 911 ?
CYNTHIA: I went home .
ARTHUR: You went home . Straight home ?
CYNTHIA: Yes .
ARTHUR: And you 're sure it was Joe you saw that night ?
CYNTHIA: Yes .
ARTHUR: When you went home .
CYNTHIA: Yes . Arthur pauses .
ARTHUR: When you went home you saw Joe ? Cynthia realizes what she 's said .
CYNTHIA: No .
HELEN: Objection . Defense is trying to confuse the witness .
ARTHUR: I 'm not trying to confuse the witness , it 's the witness that 's trying to confuse the court . I have witnesses who will refute her testimony . Witnesses who were on that corne the night of the shooting , who neve saw Ms. Webb , who never heard the gunshot , who never saw Joe run past . Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment uilding that night because he lived in the alley next to it . Is n't that ight , Ms Webb ?
HELEN: Objection ! Everyone 's attention is on Cynthia .
ARTHUR: When I referred to him as Joe , you knew who I was talking about , did n't you . This case is the People versus Mr. William McCall . Not Joe . Joe has never been mentioned in this trial . How did you know who I was talking about , Ms. Webb ?
CYNTHIA: He lived in the alley next to my apartment building .
HELEN: Oh shit .
ARTHUR: Why did you lie to this court ?
CYNTHIA: I do n't know .
ARTHUR: Are you afraid of somebody ?
CYNTHIA: I do n't know .
ARTHUR: Are you protecting somebody ?
CYNTHIA: I do n't know .
RODRIGUEZ: She did n't talk .
DIVINCI: Do n't hold your breath .
RODRIGUEZ: You think she 'll talk .

WILLIAM: I was a surgeon .
DUNCAN: No shit , no shit , really . A surgeon . I know I 'm nobody to judge , but you musta been a smart guy . What the hell 's a smart guy like you doin ' in here ? Joe looks up at Duncan , hesitates , then
WILLIAM: I had an affair with anothe woman a nurse at the hospital I worked at . It was nothing I ca n't even remember much about her Except my wife found out . We had a fight . She left the house , took the kids She was hysterical . I should 've done something gone after them , I do n't know they were killed in a ca accident about a mile from the house I 've never told anybody that about why she left . Duncan nods .
DUNCAN: Hey , doc , you can trust me . It wo n't go no farther .

RODRIGUEZ: I got it .
DIVINCI: Everything okay ?
RODRIGUEZ: Are you kidding ? We 're going to kill a goddamn witness who 's in fucking jail because we killed an undercove DEA agent . I 'm sorry , but this kinda shit troubles me a little .

CYNTHIA: Was it a cop ?
MANNY: Yeah , right . Cops bail people outa jail all the time . Does n't there seem to be a dichotomy there fo you ?
CYNTHIA: I do n't like this .
MANNY: You wan na stay in jail , that 's up to you . Or you come with me .
CYNTHIA: What 'd he look like ?
MANNY: You 're a stripper right ? Lotta guys fall in love with your type . But they do n't know how to get close , know what I mean ? Somebody wants you to owe them something . Take it or leave it .

DIVINCI: What 's goin ' on here ? You mad at me or something ?
RODRIGUEZ: It was n't my idea to start killing people , Frank . That 's all I 'm sayin ' . We 're in this goddamn mess because you started killing people .
DIVINCI: Drug dealers do n't qualify as people . Never did , never will . So what the hell 's wrong with you tonight ? You suddenly worried about where all the money went ?
RODRIGUEZ: I 'm just sick of it , that 's all .
DIVINCI: I need some fresh air .
RODRIGUEZ: Frank
DIVINCI: Talk to me , okay ? Just fuckin ' talk to me . Rodriguez hesitates a moment , then
RODRIGUEZ: I do n't know I owe some money . I do n't know how I 'm gon na pay it
DIVINCI: You gambling again ?
RODRIGUEZ: Yeah , yeah I just could n't Frank let 's forget about this . Let 's just get the fuck outa here . We got enough money , let 's go . We 'll get outa the country or something .

SIMMS: He 's an animal . DEA AGENT Hooper comes up behind Simms .
AGENT HOOPER: Recorders busted up . But we might be able to salvage some of the tape .
SIMMS: I want him . You understand me , I do n't care what it takes . I want that sonuvabitch !

DIVINCI'S VOICE: I 'm askin ' you one more time .
RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE: You wan na shoot me ? Shoot me .

My guess is , your involvement is deeper than that . But I do n't eally care , I 'm not after you I get nothing if you go to jail . But I think if I help you , I can help my client .
CYNTHIA: how ?
ARTHUR: William Joe did n't do it , did he ? Cynthia hesitates , then shakes her head .
SIMMS: No goddamn way ! I 'm not going to grant that whore immunity . She lied on the stand , she 's protecting somebody . And she 's involved . I want them all .
ARTHUR: Before I leave , let me remind you that you have shit for a case . If you really care about seeing justice for your dead agent , do n't blow this deal . Immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop . It 's the only way she 's going to talk . Simms glares at Arthur .
SIMMS: If what she says is any good , I 'll deal . If it is n't , then nobody goes anywhere .

ARTHUR: to tell the truth , I had no othe witnesses to refute her testimony . But she did n't know that . All we knew was that she was reluctant to testify . You look for signs . And CAMERA CONTINUES TO Joe and Nathan .
A MAN: My God , we thought you were dead , you know . It 's just incredible that you 're here .
A WOMAN: Life moves in such strange ways . Oh , I just think what might 've happened to you had you not been arrested fo killing that poor policeman . You still might be on the street .
ANOTHER WOMAN: Joe , you look wonderful . After what you 've been through I just ca n't imagine .
WILLIAM: I 'm ready . A BLACK TUXEDO WIPES past CAMERA as we
DIVINCI: You had to do the right thing .
CYNTHIA: What d'you want ?
DIVINCI: What do I want ?
CYNTHIA: This is all I 've got .

CYNTHIA: I shouldn't 've done a lotta things in my life . But that 's not one of 'em .
DIVINCI: Let me tell you something the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of 'em knows what he 's doing .
DIVINCI'S VOICE: Shut the door and lock it .
MANNY: Jesus Christ !
DIVINCI: Lock the door . Manny locks the door .

MANNY: Want me to hold your hand ?
DIVINCI: Just walk me to the door .
MANNY: You are a real prince . Now how about my money ?
DIVINCI: You never saw me .

GIRL: Kick his balls .
RECEPTIONIST: Not yet Mrs. Lubin . The dog humps away .
SOFTLY: Kick his balls .
LARGE: I do n't want to hurt him .
GIRL: It 's the only way to teach them . I have three Dobermans . If I did n't kick them in the balls regularly I 'd never get anything done .
LARGE: Yeah , but I do n't want to like destroy future generations of charitable dogs . Besides he 's got to be close to finishing by now .

MRS. LUBIN: Okay . C'mon Arthur .
LARGE: I feel so used .
SAM: I recognize you .
LARGE: Oh , did you go to Columbia High ?
SAM: No , not from high school , from TV . Did n't you play the retarded quarterback .
LARGE: Yeah .
SAM: Are you really retarded ? He stares at her .
LARGE: No .
SAM: That 's cool . Great job , man . You were- I mean I thought you were eally retarded . You were just as good as that corky kid and he 's eally retarded . I mean if there 's some kind of like retarded Emmy you could win . You 'd kick Corky 's ass .
LARGE: I got to fill this thing out , but thank you for that .
SAM: Oh , okay . Right on . My cousin 's an actor . Jake Ryan Winters . I doubt you 'd know him . He was on `` Sheena '' once as some gnome or something . I think that 's great though .
LARGE: Thank you .
SAM: Oh that last scene where you make that speech to the whole stadium and your Dad gives you the thumbs up ; that was - it was emotional . I mean I did n't cry , but I think my Dad did .
LARGE: Well thanks . Thank you .
SAM: So are you doing anything else ?
LARGE: No . Not right now I 'm just
SAM: Any other retarded roles ? I 'm sure you could definitely get more of those .
LARGE: No , I 'm just auditioning and. , .
SAM: I ca n't believe you 're not really etarded . Jake 's not a very good actor . I mean on `` Sheens '' you could n't really tell 'cause he was in a hairy gnome suit , but he used to put on these really low-budge enditions of Andrew Lloyd Webbe musicals in our attic when we were kids and they were awful . It sucks 'cause there is n't a whole lotta work for little people , you know ? Anyway sorry I talk too much , fill out your forms . Large just stares at her . She 's funny .
LARGE: What are you listening to ?
SAM: `` The Shins . '' You know them ?
LARGE: No .
SAM: Oh are you kidding me ? You got ta here this one song , it 'll change your life I promise you . Oh but you have to fill out your forms . Conundrum .
BEAT: Well do it while you listen to
LARGE: That 's cool . I like it .
SAM: So what are you doing here ?
LARGE: What are you doing here ?
SAM: Waiting for a friend . You ?
LARGE: I 'm uh there 's a_..
SAM: Fuck , that was nosey , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to be nosey . That was so nosey .
LARGE: Its al=ight . I I uh get headaches . So I just wan na have that checked out .
SAM: Cool .
RECEPTIONIST: Andrew Largeman ?
LARGE: Yes .
RECEPTIONIST: We 're ready for you .
LARGE: Okay . He stands . He turns to Sam .
SAM: You did n't . I 'm Sam .
LARGE: Andrew .
LARGE: Thanks .
RECEPTIONIST: Do n't worry Sam , we 'll get to you next . Large turns to Sam . She looks away .
DOCTOR: Mr. Andrew Largeman .
LARGE: Yes - hi .
DOCTOR: There 's absolutely nothing wrong with you . Large stares .
LARGE: What ?
DOCTOR: I 'm just kidding , how would I know that ?
LARGE: Yeah . They shape hands .
DOCTOR: I 'm Doctor Cohen . What can we do for you today , Andrew ?
LARGE: I 've been having these really intense headaches . They only last for a split second and then they 're gone . It 's like a lightning flash ; almost like a surge of electricity and then it 's gone . He looks at the chart .
DOCTOR: You 're Gideon 's kid . I did n't even put the two together .
LARGE: Yeah .
DOCTOR: I 'm sorry about you 're Mother .
LARGE: Yeah . Thank you .
DOCTOR: I must have missed you at Shiva last night .
LARGE: Yeah .
DOCTOR: So how long have these headaches een going on ?
LARGE: Well I think I 've had them in some form since I was a little kid . But they 've been getting more and more frequent over the last year .
DOCTOR: How long have you been on the Lithium ?
LARGE: Oh uh , I 've been on some form of it since I was ten or so .
DOCTOR: And what about Paxil , Zoloft , Celexa , Depakote ; did any of that ever help you ?
LARGE: No . I mean I do n't know . It 's ecently occurred to me that I might not even have a problem . only I 'd never know it , because as fa ack as I can remember I 've been medicated . I grew up on it . I left them in LA . This is the first time I have n't had it in my body since I can remember .
DOCTOR: Well it 'll leave your body pretty fast . I 'll write you a prescription .
LARGE: Actually I. was thinking about taking a little vacation .
DOCTOR: Have you spoken to you psychiatrist about that ?
LARGE: E ) h well , my psychiatrist is my Dad . So uh he I think he 'd prefe me to stay on it . He likes to think it makes me happy . And I let him think that because he 's sort of consumed by the idea of making everyone happy .
DOCTOR: Well look , I 'll examine you and give you a Catscan just so you wo n't worry that it 's anything serious . But to be honest , I think the headaches are something else . Our bodies do very funny things when they 're consumed with stress and anxiety . Things you 'd neve expect . I found my ex-best friend 's cuff links in my wife 's puree and I could n't get an erection for a yea and a half .
BEAT: For example .
LARGE: But that does n't really feel like it . I mean I do n't feel stressed o eally anxious at all .
DOCTOR: Well with all the Lithium he 's had you on it 's amazing you can even hear me right now_
LARGE: Oh , right .
DOCTOR: First of all , I do think you need to find a psychiatrist that is n't your father . That just 's something that should have been remedied years ago . He knows better . Secondly , I 'm not in a position to comment on whether or not you should stay on the meds or not ; I do n't know your story . But my opinion , since you 're paying fo it , is that those drugs may help as a means to an end . But if you 're not In any sort of therapy , soone or later what 's ever going on in your mind will find a way to peek it 's little head out of the water . Just something to think about .
LARGE: Why were you really there ?
SAM: Charging . I 'm a robot .
LARGE: Do you lie a lot ?
SAN: What do you consider a lot ?
LARGE: Enough for people to call you a liar .
SAM: People call me lots of things .
LARGE: Is one of them `` liar '' ?
SAM: I could say `` no '' , but how will you know I 'm not lying .
LARGE: Because I ` ll choose to trust YOU .
SAM: You can do that ?
LARGE: I can try .
SAM: Who 's bike is this ?
LARGE: It was my grandfather 's . It was the only thing he left to anyone in my family and he left it to me . And I like it .
SAM: This is the point where you ask me if I 'd like a ride home ?
LARGE: It is ?
SAM: Yup .
LARGE: Would you like a ride home ?
SAM: Fine , but I ' m not getting in that sidecar ,
LARGE: Why not ?
SAM: Sidecars are for bitches . Anyone who gets in that thing is automatically your bitch . Thus , I will ride on the back . She climbs on the back behind him .
LARGE: What are you like a hanglider ? They drive off .
SAM: I thought my boyfriend was gon na pick me up on his bike , so I ought it But then he could n't so
LARGE: So what , it 's like one of those tandem things ?
SAM: No , its a Ninja . Way faster than this thing .
LARGE: But what kind of helmet is that ?
SAM: You can use it on a motorcycle . Anyway , how 's your head ?
LARGE: I should live through the day .
SAM: Cool . Make a right here . They stop at a light .
LARGE: Are you doing anything right now ?
SAM: Can you elaborate on `` doing anything '' ?
LARGE: Well , I just had this idea . I promised this guy I 'd stop by his house that 's right up here , but I do n't really wan na stay very long . So I was just thinking if you came with me I could say I have to take you home when I 'm ready to go .
SAM: Wow . well that 's pretty damn random of ya , Andrew .
LARGE: I know .
SAM: 'Nice to meet you . May I use you ? ' That 's the Hollywood in ya I guess .
LARGE: No , it 's not like that , c'mon . It 'll be fun . I promise .
BEAT: I 'll tell you what . We 'll have like a signal . When you pull on your ea that 's the code and then I 'll say , , `` Well I 've got to get her home now . '' And then we 'll go . She mulls it over .
SAM: Can we have code names too ?
LARGE: If you 'd like .
SAM: okay . But do n't try and like kidnap me or anything , because my step-uncle 's a bounty hunter and I could have you tracked and killed .
LARGE: Liar . The light changes and they drive off .
JESSE: 'Kay ready ?
LARGE: I 'll be fine . Am I the first boy you 've ever brought home ?
YES: No . But I lied about my boyfriend driving a t.inja .
LARGE: He does n't drive a bike ?
SAM: No , I do n't have a boyfriend .
BEAT: He might drive a bike ; wherever he is .
LARGE: Well we 're off to a great start .
SAM: okay so sometimes I lie . I 'm weird , man . About random stuff too ; and I do n't even know why I do it . It 's like a tick . I swear , sometimes I hear myself say something and then I think `` Wow , that 's not even emotely true .
LARGE: So how am I supposed to know what 's eal ?
SAM: Well , I always feel bad and admit them when they 're lies .
BEAT: Can you trust that ?
LARGE: Open the door .
SAM: Down , Kevin ! Mom ! Kick their balls ! Kick their balls ! Anthrax , heel ! Mom ! Sam tries slapping them on their backs .
OLIVIA: Everybody downl Who wants to eat ? Do you want to eat ? Well then get the fuck off him ! Kevin ! Steven !

OLIVIA: Oh , tell me , what 's that Alan Thicke like ? I 've heard he 's a cocky son of a bitch .
LARGE: No , he 's a really nice guy .
OLIVIA: Oh . Well , welcome , welcome . Samantha I told you to take the wheel out of the hamster cage . She holds up a dead hamster .
SAKI: I forgot , Mom .

My mom adopted him years ago from Sally Strothers . one of those For the cost of a cup of coffee a day '' kind of things . where she 's like , `` How can you sit there and not help the children ? '' And we just could n't . We could n't sit there and not help those children . So we sent him letters and pictures for years and then I got really into ice skating and we kind of forgot about'em . Then one day the phone rang and it was Titembay and he was at the dry cleaners around the corner and he said that he was going to school at Rutgers and living in the dorms , ut since he was used to living with his tribe he 'd much rathe live with his family .
LARGE: Wow .
SAM: Yeah and he 's been here ever since . He 's an amazing guy , you got ta hea some of his stories . I mean this guy struggled through so much ecause he wanted to learn . I think of what he 's accomplished and I just feel so lazy . He 's studying criminal justice at Rutgers right now and when he was a baby he was one of those kids with flies all over his face .
LARGE: Wow . I mean that 's great . It 's a crazy story .
SAM: That , my friend , is a true story . I 'm not that good-
LARGE: What is Tickle ?
SAM: Tickle is my favorite thing in the whole world . It 's all that 's left of Nannie my blanket .
LARGE: And Tickle is all that remains ?
SAM: Yeah .
LARGE: Was there a hurricane or something ?
LAUGHING: Shut-up . No , I mean I had it since I was born . it was the blanket they ought me home in from the hospital .
LARGE: It 's like the Wailing Wall .
SAM: What ?
LARGE: The Wailing Wall . It 's like the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel . It 's all that 's left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans .
SAM: Wow , so you 're like really Jewish ? Large laughs .
LARGE: No I 'm not . I mean I 'm Jewish , but I 'm not really Jewish . I do n't do anything Jewish . I do n't go to temple or anything . But I do n't know any Jews who go to temple . The Jews I know only go on Yom Kippur . One day ; the day of repentance . Did you know that most temples are designed with movable walls so that on the one day of the year when â€¢ everyone comes to repent they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone ?
SAM: I do n't really believe in God .
LARGE: Just tickle .

LARGE: No .
SAM: Come on .
LARGE: No . Trust me yours was good enough for both of us .
SAM: Come on . What are you shy ? This is your chance to do something that has never , ever been done before and will never be copied throughout human existence . If nothing else , you 'll be remembered as the only person who ever did this .

LARGE: Now ?
SAM: Yes .

LARGE: Uh Right now I was thinking I was thinking that I 've been going to a lot of these things lately .
SAM: What , dates ?
LARGE: No , not dates . This is n't a date . Is this a date ? Funerals .
SAM: Oh . Who else died ?
EMBARRASSED: Uh that 's why I 'm home actually .

SAM: How did she die ? Large thinks about that .
LARGE: No , its okay . She uh she drowned actually . Sam 's jaw drops .
SAM: When ?
LARGE: This was uh Hmm Sunday .
SAM: Oh my God . Tears roll down her face .
LARGE: Why are you crying ?
SAM: I do n't know , I 'm sorry , I 'm not usually like this . It 's just so sad . It 's so tragic . Is n't it ? It is . It 's like real life tragedy o something .
LARGE: Look , let 's change the subject , okay ? Let 's really bring the focus ack to Jelly . I mean what could be uder than talking about someone else who died while you 're in the act of burying a close friend . Sam places the box in the hole she 's dug .
SAM: What should we do ?
LARGE: Well IIve only been to one of these things , you appear to be the expert .
SAM: We usually say something .
LARGE: okay , well I 'll go first . I did n't eally know you , Jelly . But from what I hear , you were a good pet . Had a little trouble with the wheel
SAM: its not funny . Jelly you were a great pet . Tears roll down her face .
BEAT: Goodbye . I hope that you liked me .
TIRED MAN: Avi wants his Bar Mitzvah theme to e musicals . As in Broadway musicals . Can you believe that ? Paul 's kid 's theme was the Meta ; I got to do the Elora with Mookie Wilson . Miriam and I were at one last weekend at the Pierre ; whole thing was like a winte wonderland live penguins wearing yalmulkas . Now me , I got to lay out ten grand alone for some asshole to uild a barricade of French garbage across the boccie lanes at my tennis club .
LARGE: I was just thinking-
BEAT: I was just thinking you spend you 're whole life lusting fo anything you do n't have . You stress over money and your career , you set your clocks back , you exercise , you wait in line , you paint your house , get depressed , feel better , buy things , take your clothes to the dry cleaner , set your clocks forward and spend your whole life waiting for happiness to arrive in the mail . Then you die and people are really sad , they cry really hard
CYNTHIA: Oh please be a little more interesting than that .
LARGE: Miss me ?
CYNTHIA: No . Me ?
LARGE: No .
BEAT: She did n't like being alive . She got what she wanted . This should be a party . Instead we 're supposed to mope . About what ? She never did anything .
CYNTHIA: She made you .
LARGE: some trophy . I do have to say I 'm impressed with the turnout .
CYNTHIA: What , you did n't think people would come ?
LARGE: Seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up . Do n't you ever think about who 'll show up to yours ?
CYNTHIA: No . Right now I 'm alive , so I think about living .
LARGE: It 's one way to determine who you friends are . The people who 'd show up at my funeral if it was held in their state , that 's one level of friend . But my real friends , the people who really love me , they 'd come if it was on the other side of the country .
CYNTHIA: So where do I fall into that ?
LARGE: You 'd be there .
CYNTHIA: Oh you think so ?
LARGE: I do . I think you 'd show up because the truth is , that you really did miss met you always thought of me as the brother you never had . But you 've got too much pride to let me know that . You want to pout 'cause I do n't return your calls .
CYNTHIA: you 're way more talkative than I emember .
LARGE: Today I 've been more talkative than I remember .
CYNTHIA: What about mine ?
LARGE: Funeral ? Honestly ? I probably would n't travel for it- no . But do n't worry , I 'm sure you 'll have a great turnout .
CYNTHIA: Why do you say that ?
LARGE: 'Cause there 's also the guy who lives his life to insure a good turnout . I think that 's how my Dad lives his- , like he 's sort of writing his own eulogy as he goes and making life choices dependent on how it will sound in a speech .
CYNTHIA: Are you implying that that 's why I 'm going to med school o something ?
LARGE: I 'm just saying a lot of people - not necessarily you - a lot of people try and accumulate accolades that will somehow justify thei lives .
CYNTHIA: It 's said we spend ninety-five percent of our lives trying to look good .
LARGE: Where do I sign up for not caring ?
CYNTHIA: How about sucking it up and really having it out with your Dad ? That would be a tremendous step towards not needing to look good .
LARGE: Wow , that was so clever how you did that . Is he grooming you to be a psychiatrist too ? Med school 's one thing , but please do n't become him .
CYNTHIA: He 's one of the most caring people I 've ever met .
LARGE: well you would say that ; you 're the son and daughter he never had . Hell , you 're the family he neve had . Has he got you on Lithium yet ? Wait till he does , you 'll love him even more . He stands .
CYNTHIA: I bet my Mom a dollar you were coming home with a message . I said after nine years , he 's definitely coming home with a message .
LARGE: i looked for a message ; I got bored and became an actor . He leaves .
BEAT: Dad ?
LARGE: Holy shit , you scared the shit out of me .
GIDEON: Just wake up ?
LARGE: Yeah .
GIDEON: Sleep all right ?
LARGE: Yeah fine .
GIDEON: Mmmm .
BEAT: I have n't even really been in here for a while . I 've been using the one in the hall . Shower pressures awful in there though . It 's by no means as good a bathroom as this one is . This one is- well we redid all this . Its uh This is hard .
LARGE: Yeah .
GIDEON: Janice will make you some lunch .
LARGE: Yeah good .
GIDEON: Well I guess it 's breakfast fo you . What time is it ?
LARGE: Yeah . Silence . DRIP . DRIP
GIDEON: No I can . I know . I figured you would want to
LARGE: But we do n't have to do it now . I mean you do n't have to do that now . It 's just at some point I would I have some questions .
GIDEON: I knew that you would . Silence .
BEAT: She took a bath every night . And she was always very quiet .
BEAT: so anyway , then usually she would call me when she was done , so I could come and help her out . But this time , that night she neve called . And I just figured she was taking a longer bath or something , ut when I called out to her , she did n't answer . So then I uh When I came in , she was there .
LARGE: So she did n't yell or
GIDEON: No . I did n't hear anything . The TV was on pretty loud . I always watch the weather report before I go to sleep .
LARGE: It 's just weird .
GIDEON: What ?
LARGE: I do n't know , it 's just that you 'd think if someone was really drowning to death they would scream . I mean really scream from the terror of it all , you know ? They would splash and scream I would think ; I would have thought .
GIDEON: I would have too , but no . Nothing . What ?
LARGE: Do n't take this the wrong way .
GIDEON: What ?
LARGE: I 'm not reading into this , I 'm just thinking out loud so do n't get
GIDEON: What ? No .
LARGE: What ?
GIDEON: Its not that .
LARGE: I 'm just saying did they check ? I mean has someone ruled that out ?
GIDEON: No . Because they know she drowned , Andrew .
LARGE: I 'm just saying the facts .
GIDEON: No .
LARGE: And I suppose it does n't even eally matter . But I 'd be curious to know . I would like to know if that 's what happened ; just for me . I mean would that surprise you ?
GIDEON: No . Yee !
LARGE: She made it very clear to everyone she knew that nothing was eve going to make her happy-
GIDEON: I know ! Do you think I do n't know ? !
LARGE: And c'mon let 's be honest ; she tried it before .
GIDEON: Shut-up ! .lust shut your fucking mouth . Large is taken aback .
FIGHTING TEARS: If nothing else will you please just leave , her alone . She 's gone . That 's it . That 's all you get . She died . We will never see her again . She tried very hard , but she just could n't find it . She could neve find it . And I think - I know that she 's found it now . I know that . And I know there 's a certain amount of guilt that you must feel for the way things unfolded , but it 's too late now .
LARGE: I think I deserve to know the truth .
GIDEON: You want to make her crazy . Why ? Does that make it easier for you ?
BEAT: I dreamt last night that I had special powers . If I squeezed my eyes shut and clinched my fiats closed tight enough , we 'd all wake up in paradise . ( with a laugh through
TEARS: I was like a superhero and that was my power .
MARK: How could you leave all that Lithium ? I was totally gon na hit you up for some .

SAM: Oh c'mon . Do n't ya see that it 's a joke . If you ca n't laugh at yourself life 's gon na seem a lot longer than you 'd like .
LARGE: So what should we laugh at you about ?
SAM: I lied again . I have epilepsy .
LARGE: Which part are we laughing about ?
SAM: I had a seizure in the law office where I work and they said thei insurance would only cover me if I wore `` preventative covering '' .
LARGE: Preventative covering ?
SAM: The helmet I was carrying . Large is silent .
LARGE: I have n't cried since I was a little kid . I did n't cry at my mother 's funeral . I wanted to-
A SMILE: I tried . I thought of all the saddest things I could think of ; things in movies , this image from Life magazine that haunts me nothing came .
SAM: What do you mean ?
LARGE: Oh , no . Mark , Dave and Jesse appear with some others .
MARK: Hey . Nice to meet you .

SAM: Fooled me . I thought you just had a cramp .
BEAT: Or two . He smiles .
LARGE: There 's a handful of normal kid things I kinda missed .

LARGE: Probably till my fingers get wrinkly .
SAM: No , I mean in Jersey .
LARGE: Oh . I think I 'll probably head home the day after tomorrow . well , LA . That 's not my home . Rer smile fades .
SAM: I still feel at home in my house .
LARGE: You 'll gee when you move out . It just kind of happens one day and it 's gone . And you feel like you can never get it back . it 's like you feel homesick for a place that does n't even exist . But maybe it 's like this rite of passage , you know ? And you wo n't ever have that feeling again until you create a A new idea of `` home '' for yourself , for the family you start , for you kids . It 's like this cycle .
BEAT: Maybe that 's all a family really is ; a group of people who miss the same imaginary place .
SAM: Maybe .
MARK: How 'bout some fucking furniture dude .
JESSE: I bought a chair but I did n't like it .
SAM: Where is it ?
JESSE: Its keeping us warm .
MARK: Silent Velcro . Lucky motherfucker . I got an idea loud tape , we 'll make millions .
LARGE: I feel like if I had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent Velcro they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner . They all laugh .
SAM: So why did they send you away ? She takes a sip of her beer .
JESSE: Whoa , listen to this girl .
LARGE: They did n't send me away .
MARK: You 're the one who said they sent you away .
LARGE: I mean they did , but they sent me to boarding school . `` Sent me away '' implies I went to some asylum or something . There were no straps involved .
SAM: Why did they send you to boarding school ? Large looks to Jesse and Mark .
LARGE: They sent me to boarding school ecause uh they thought I might e dangerous .
IMPERSONATING SAM: Oh are you freaked out ? You 're so freaked out right now .
SARCASTIC: That 's funny .
NORMAL: Why did they think you might be dangerous ?
MARK: I 'm dangerous and I did n't get to go to boarding school .
LARGE: I was a kid and I was - they just I was a teenager and they were depressed and it just was n't a good combo .
SAM: But obviously something happened . I mean there must have been an event .
JESSE: You 're like a little detective .
LARGE: I know . You and Titembay should go into business together ; solve mysteries out of a van .
SAM: Am I being too nosey ?
LARGE: No . No . I just it 's fine.. I just have n't ever really talked about it .
JESSE: To be honest , I never really knew either . I mean I heard stories .
LARGE: You wan na know ?
SAM: Yeah .
LARGE: Really , really ?
MARK: You 're gay .
LARGE: No . Drumroll I was the reason she was in a wheelchair .
BEAT: I pushed her .
BEAT: So there that is .
SAM: Shut up .
MARX: Fuck you .
LARGE: No , it 's the truth .
SAM: Why ?
LARGE: It was a complete freak accident . I mean its one of those things that you replay a million times in you head and you see so clearly what a freak thing it was . I Say whole life she was depressed for no eason . Look at this picture .
BEAT: I mean it was innocent . I was just frustrated 'cause
SAM: You could n't make her happy .
LARGE: Yeah . Fuck yeah . And any othe time , she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room , but this time , in that moment , the door of the dishwasher was open . The latch on it was broken and it would just andomly fall open . That fucking latch ; it 's funny how so much of my life hasbeendetermined by a quarterinchpiece of plastic . So she fellbackover the door and he neck hitthekitchen counter ; paralyzing her from the waist down . Sam 's eyes are wide in shock .
SAM: Oh my God .
LARGE: Still want to compare fucked up families ?
JESSE: But your Mom was in the wheelchai long before you left .
LARGE: Well I was nine . They sent me to therapy and my Father put me on these drugs that were supposed to `` curb my anger '' . And I 've been on some form of them ever since . My Mother who was clinically depressed efore the accident , sank even lower to the point where she just ignored everyone but ou housekeeper , Janice and he daughter , Cynthia . And when I was sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came around to the conclusion that it might not be the healthiest environment for me to be growing up in . So he sent me to boarding school . And I have n't been home since .
SAM: Until now .
MARK: For her funeral .
LARGE: Until now for her funeral . I 'm off to a ripping start in this life , huh ? Next time through I think I 'll lay low out of the gate . He takes a sip of his beer .
SAM: It sounds like a punishment .
LARGE: I think it was . So I left them in LA . I 'm taking myself off punishment .
MARK: Please do n't remind me .
JESSE: All he heard of that whole story was `` left drugs in LA '' .
MARK: Fuck you .
JESSE: Crackhead .
GIRL: Mark ? Where 's the sauna ?
LARGE: What ?
SAM: You 're `` in it '' right now are n't you ?
LARGE: what do you mean ?
SAM: My Mom always says that when she can see I 'm like working something ig out she 'll say , `` Are you in it ight now ? '' And I look at you , and you tell me this story and you 're you 're definitely `` in it '' ight now .
LARGE: I think you 're right . I 'm `` in it '' . But I 'm so glad I 'm `` in it '' 'cause I 'm working it all out , you know ? I have n't swallowed a pill in fou days now and I can already feel this eerie clarity . It 's probably the reason I just ca n't stop fucking talking ; these.rusty cogs in my brain have started spinning fast .
SAM: Maybe that 's why you 've been getting those headaches .
LARGE: Alright can we just forget about all that stuff please and talk about good etuff .
SAM: Good stuff ?
LARGE: Yeah , glass half-full shit . What do you got ?
SAM: I got a little buzz . That 's what I 've got . What do you got ?

LARGE: Dollars ?
MARK: Yeah . But it 's too early . You do n't sell'em yet . Do n't you know anything about investing . I 'm gon na live off that shit . That `` Schwarzkopf '' card is worth at least five something . And if you have the complete set it 's worth like thousands .
LARGE: So do you have the complete set ?
MARK: Almost . The corners are bent on my `` Friendly Fire '' and someone stole my `` Wolf Blitzer '' .
LARGE: Someone stole it ?
MARK: One of my Mom 's Medieval Times friends , man . Drug addicts .
LARGE: For drugs they sold it ?
MARK: Yeah .
LARGE: Wolf Blitzer .
MARK: It does n't matter if you 're a rich house wife looking for your muscle elaxers or some crack head drying cars people will do anything in this town to get their drug money .

MARK: Just that Gleason kid . Oh , and Tina .
LARGE: Tina who ?
MARK: You remember Tina . She was like anorexic . She did gymnastics Sam is horrified by this conversation .
LARGE: oh yeah , gymnastics Tina . How 'd she do it ?
MARK: I do n't know . She was n't Jewish , I did n't bury her .

SAM: Hey .
MARK: Listen I 'm gon na go grab that thing . So just hang here and I 'll e back .
LARGE: Oh . He walks off .
KARL: He 's such a dick . '
LARGE: Why 'd you say that ?
KARL: He stole my little brother 's last dose of Ritalin and the little fucker glued his lips closed . Were n't you on TV or something ?
LARGE: Yeah . Yeah I was . Just this thing . So you 're like what , working here ?
DISMISSIVE: Only for awhile I 'm opening my own usiness . Actually , I should tell you about it . I 'm looking for smart people like you , Large . I should get your number .

SAM: Nice meeting you .
MARK: Why is it always the losers who get into the pyramid schemes ? Why is n't it ever some charming hot girl nagging you incessantly to buy shit ?
LARGE: Oh , is that what it is ?
MARK: Detergent or some shit . The thing I do n't understand is , if it worked , why would he be working here . The guy 's a freak ; he pops Darvocet like it 's Ritalin .
LARGE: Why are you buying knives ? I do n't need knives .
MARK: I 'd like to return these .
WOMAN: You got a receipt .
MARK: Actually , no . It was a gift .
WOMAN: Why are you returning these ?
MARK: They 're not sharp enough .
WOMAN: They 're not sharp enough ?
MARK: No . Not for what we need them for . They could n't cut cans .
WOMAN: You bought them to cut cans ?
MARK: No , but in the commercial they say that if I wanted to cut cans I could . But with these knives I ca n't .
WOMAN: Well it comes with a sharpener . Did you try it ?
MARK: Yeah , they 're just I do n't want them ; not sharp enough .
WOMAN: Thirty-nine , fifty-three . I hope we came in handy at Handi-World . Please come again . They exit the store and enter the mall .
MARK: A major loop-hole in the Handi- World return policy permits returns without receipts on items below forty dollars .
LARGE: So how often do you go ?
MARK: I hit every employee once , then wait for them to . hire . new ones . Luckily , no one works at Handi- World for very long . Except Karl Benson .
LARGE: You know , Mark , it 's my last day in town . I have money . I can give you some .
MARK: I do n't need your money , I 'm making my own right now .
LARGE: Or fuck , take Jesse 's - the guys a millionaire .

MARK: Wow .
DIEGO: That shit was hot ! I got to go drop some knowledge on that ho .

SAM: Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett .
DIEGO: Who the fuck are you ?
MARX: Oh , this is Sam and Large .
DIEGO: No offense .
TO MARK: Why are you bringing these people here ?
MARK: He 's the guy who needs that thing . Look I brought you the tank , so can you just tell us where to go now ?

DIEGO: All right . Hold-up . Who here just saw some titties ? ! They all stare .

LARGE: Okay , stop . What the fuck are we doing ?
MARX: Just be patient .
LARGE: Dude , we 've been patient all day , ut it 's my last day in town and you have n't told me what the fuck we 're doing . I mean if you told me we were going on a six hou scavenger hunt for blow I would have passed .
MARK: Blow ? Please . If I was gon na give you coke we 'd have gone to the high school football practice and we 'd a een reeling five hours ago .
LARGE: Well I think we 've corrupted this innocent girl enough for one afternoon .
SAM: I 'm not innocent .
LARGE: Yes , you are . And that 's what I like about you . And I do n't want this fucking guy taking you to the ottom of a quarry in a sketchy-ass neighborhood to find some Pitbull 's aping each other or crack whore 's huffing turpentine o whatever it is that you have us
MARK: Wow . That 's the most worked up I 've ever seen you .
SAM: He was protecting me .
LARGE: So .
SAM: He likes me .
LARGE: Do n't be cute .
SAM: You 're my knight in shining armor .

MARK: I 'm gon na kill that motherfucker .
LARGE: Pun intended ? Beat as Mark gets it . He comes after him .
MARK: You 're dead . They play wrestle as Sam watches .
SAM: Wow .
LARGE: I never even knew this was here .
MARK: I 've heard about it . They were supposed to build a mall here I think .
SAM: Yeah I remember reading about it in the paper .
LARGE: Can you imagine the guy who 's jo it is to fight for the right to uild his mall on some like geological phenomenon ?
MARK: They love their mall 's here man . Okay let 's just find this guy and get outta here .
LARGE: You 're not gon na tell us what we 're getting ?
MARK: It 's a surprise , you 'll see .
LARGE: So knock . Knock and barter fo `` Dessert Storm Trading Cards '' .
MARY: Please do n't tease me about my hobbies . I do n't tease you about eing an asshole .
ALBERT: Mark ?
MARK: Yeah . Are you Albert ?
ALBERT: Yes . Come on in out of the rain .
SAM: I must say , I 've been continually impressed today with how each new place you bring us manages to be weirder and weirder .
MARK: What do you mean , this is nice .
LARGE: ah nothing , just hanging out in an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark .
MARK: It 's hardly the bottom , dude . Did you see that cliff ?
ALBERT: This is my wife , Faye .
ALL: Hi . Hello .
FAYE: Hi . Welcome .
ALBERT: This is Mark and Sam and Large , ight ?
ALBERT: Diego told me when he called . Please have a seat , make yourselves comfortable .
FAYE: Its really coming down out there , huh ?
LARGE: Yeah , it just started pouring all of a sudden .
ALBERT: Well in a bad storm I like to pretend this old boat 's my own private `` ark '' . Unfortunately , if this is the apocalypse , I 'm not quite sure it still floats .
FAYE: Would any of you like some tea ?
SAM: I 'd love some tea . Large and Mark look at her .
LARGE: No thanks .
MARX: No.. thanks .
LARGE: What is it that you do here ? What is this place ?
ALBERT: Good question . We 're calling it Kiernan 's Fault . And no one 's eally quite sure what it is ecause they have n't been able to explore it . They 're locked in a legal battle over who has the ights to the land .
LARGE: Oh . Wow .
ALBERT: What they do n't know is that I 'm a geologist working undercover fo the preservation lobby . So , at night I go down .
FAYE: He 's documenting it to support their case .
SAM: Wow . So how deep does it go ?
ALBERT: No one really knows . I 've been in the furthest and that was about two miles down . But I like to pretend it 's infinite .
SAM: It 's kind of an odd job is n't it ? Guardian of an infinite abyss ?
ALBERT: Yeah , I guess it is . We also trade and deal in antique jewelry . I suppose it 's pretty odd for you that we live down here like this-
SAM: No .
LARGE: Not at all .
MARK: Never crossed my mind .
ALBERT: But we think it 's important .
LARGE: Why ? What do you think you 'll find ?
ALBERT: I do n't know . It 's exciting . New frontiers are hard to come by these days . I guess I just like the idea of discovering something .
LARGE: Yeah . `` Albert 's Abyss '' .
ALBERT: Who knows ? Maybe . But I used to think that was all that mattered . No matter what it was , as long as I could put my name on it . Like it would somehow justify the fact that I lived ; that I was here . `` I did that . That 's mine . I got this plate on my travels . '' But you know what ? That 's all ego ; none of that stuff eally matters . If at the end of the day I get to be with her , if I get to be with this person right here and the baby we created , then that 's all I need . Just having felt that If I die in an hour , I know I 've lived . Faye kisses his forehead .
LARGE: You know `` my whole life I 've had that same anxiety that if I did n't discover something or save something or
SAM: Save something from being discovered .
LARGE: Yeah . That I 'll have somehow wasted my time here . And that somewhere , whatever force created us , would esent me for it .
ALBERT: Well I think that force would ather remind you that `` breathing 's all it takes to be a miracle '' .
MARX: Yeah , that would be great .
ALBERT: It took me awhile to track this piece down . But I owe Diego huge .
MARK: That 's it . Thank you . They all stand .
SAM: Well thank you for the tea .
LARGE: Yeah , thanks .
FAYE: Okay , good luck in the rain . Would you like some garbage bags o something ?
LARGE: Yeah , that would be great .
ALBERT: Good-bye .
LARGE: , Hey Albert l
ALBERT: Yeah ?
LARGE: Good luck exploring the infinite
ALBERT: Thank you .
LARGE: So I do n't know if I 'm gon na see you .
MARK: I know . Do n't you wan na know what 's in the bag ?
LARGE: To be honest , I do n't even care anymore .
MARK: I 'd be lying to ya if I told ya this was my plan all along .
BEAT: But I got it back . That 's got to be worth something , right ?
LARGE: This whole day was about this ?
NODDING: And anyway you did n't want it down there with her . It 's better for you to have it .
SAM: What is it ?
LARGE: It 's my Mom 's favorite necklace .
SAM: Why not ? I 'm curious . She 's sitting here , across from you and you can say anything at all . All the things you never got a chance to say .
BEAT: No ?
LARGE: Okay .
BEAT: I would
SAM: What ?
LARGE: I really do n't wan na
BEAT: I would tell her that I 'm sorry .
SAM: Oh , my God , Large I think I see one .
LARGE: Shut-up .
SAM: Yeah , I do . Do n't move , we should save it or something . She finds a clear plastic cup .
LARGE: I guess I could put it in my scrapbook , if I had a scrapbook . They wait .
SAM: Is that it ?
LARGE: I think so . I do n't feel any more coming .
SAM: Well if you do , let me know and I 'll grab the cup , okay ?
LARGE: Yeah .
SAM: This was a good idea . Keep talking .
LARGE: It 's funny ; this thing reminds me of this really random memory of my mother . Its so weird , I have n't thought about this in so long , but this great memory I have where I was a little kid and I was crying for one reason or another and she was kind of holding me and rocking me back and forth . And I could see the little balls in this thing just olling back and forth . And there was just snot dripping down my nose .
HE LAUGHS: And she just handed me her sleeve and told me to just blow my nose into it . And I remember thinking , even as a very little kid , `` Wow . This is love . ''
SAM: oh , Large I 'm never gon na be able to get all these .
LARGE: It 's so funny is n't it ? But I think that 's the single most amazing moment I remember of my Mother . 'Cause she was n't sad and she was n't being prodded to be happy , she was just there .
SAM: To be your Mom .
BEAT: Look at me .
THROUGH TEARS: I just do n't
SAM: Just let it all go . He cries with his elbow over his eyes .
GENTLE: What is it ?
LARGE: I would say that it 's Love .
BEAT: It 's this Love that I have .
SAM: Yeah , it is .
BEAT: And you 've got so much of it in you God , you do . You 've got so many years of it in you , pleading to come out .
LARGE: This fucking hurts .
SAM: I know . But that that is life . if nothing else That is life . St 's real . And sometimes it burns . But maybe it might be all there is .
BEAT: Look at you . Look at you . You look like you just came back to life . He just stares at her .
BAFFLED: who are you ?
SMILING: I 'm your new friend , Sam . Holding up her sleeve .
LARGE: Fuck . I feel like I just get so much thrown at me ; like there 's so much speeding by me in a day that I feel like if I look up from the sidewalk , I 'll get dizzy and fall down . So it 's like I just arrel through and do n't look up , so I 'll just never fall , you know ? And that 's really and you know it 's so sad to say this , but that 's eally how I 've been living my whole life .
SAM: Trying to barrel through .
LARGE: Yeah .
SAM: Well it sounds like you were due to fall .
LARGE: Yeah .
REALIZING: Yeah I was . Thanks Mom . That 's funny . The definition 's always confused me , but I 'm pretty sure that 's irony .
SAM: How do you feel ?
LARGE: Safe .
BEAT: When I 'm with you , I feel so safe like I 'm Rome .
LARGE: Dad ? He sits up startled .
GIDEON: Oh , hey , hey c'mon in .
LARGE: Sorry to wake you .
GIDEON: No , no , it 's uh I was just eading .
LARGE: I 've been on a pretty crazy little journey these last couple of days .
GIDEON: You 've been avoiding me .
LARGE: No , I just maybe I have been .
GIDEON: I 'm sure you can find plenty of things in your life to be angry about , but what I do n't understand is why you 're so angry at me . All I ever wanted was for everybody to be happy again , Andrew . That 's all I ever wanted .
LARGE: But when were we ever all happy , Dad ? I mean you always say that , ut when was that ? When was this time that you have in your mind that you wish we could all get back to ? 'Cause I do n't have it in my memory . Maybe if I did I could help steer us back there . But we should
BEAT: You know you and I need to work on being okay if that 's not in the cards for us .
GIDEON: Well we might have a shot at it if you could just forgive yourself fo what you did .
LARGE: What I did ? What I did ? ! You know what , Dad ? I 'm gon na forgive myself for what I did right now I was a little boy and somebody made a shitty latch . That 's what I think now . And I 'm not gon na I mean I 'm not gon na take all those drugs anymore . Because they 've left me completely numb . I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life . And fo that ; I 'm here to forgive you . Gideon site up against the headboard .
GIDEON: Going against your doctor 's ecommendation ; that 's a pretty weighty experiment to take on do n't you think ?
LARGE: This is my life , Dad . This is it . I 've spent twenty-six years waiting for something else to start . So no , I do n't think it 's too much to take on . Because it 's everything there is .
BEAT: I see now it 's all there is .
GIDEON: Perhaps the great tragedy of my life , will be that you both deserved more than I knew how to give ?
LARGE: We deserved nothing more than you . And you deserved nothing more than us .
SAM: What are you doing ?
LARGE: I do n't want to hurt you .
SAM: No . Why ? How can you how could you What 's going on ? What happened ? We can figure out the long distance thing . Do n't this is a good thing , Large . Do n't you 're gon na be please do n't do this . Shestarts crying .
LARGE: Sam .
THROUGH TEARS: You do n't realize . This is good . This does n't happen often in you life . We can figure this stuff out . I wan na help you . We need each other ; I have n't even lied in two days .
LARGE: Is that true ?
SAM: No .
LARGE: Look at me . Sam , look at me . This is not over . I 'm not putting a period at the end of this thing . I 'm putting like an ellipses on it . Because I 'm worried that if i do n't go figure myself out , if I do n't go land on my feet and be okay on my own , I 'm gon na fuck this up . And I do n't want to do that . This matters too much to me .
FEMALE VOICE: Gideon ?
GIDEON: I need an ambulance .
SAM: What are you doing ?
LARGE: Remember that idea I had about growing and working stuff out on my own and then finding you when I 'd figured myself out ?
SAM: The ellipses ?
LARGE: Yeah the ellipses . Its dumb . It 's an awful idea . And I 'm not gon na do it . Because like you said , this is it . This is life . And I 'm in love with you , Samantha . I think that 's the only thing I 've .ever been really sure of in my whole life . I 'm really fucked up ight now , but I do n't want to waste any more of my life without you in it . Okay ?
SAM: Yeah .
LARGE: Because I think I can do this . I know I can . I want to . We have to . Yeah ?
LARGE: Okay . What do we do ?
DIRECTOR JOSEF: You keep your work station so clean , Jerome .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: I reviewed your flight plan . Not one erro
LAMAR: Jeromenever shy . Pisses on command . You 've got a beautiful cock . I ever told you that , Jerome ?
JEROME: Only every time I 'm in here .
JEROME: I 'll tell you at the end of the week . Jerome departs .
NURSE: What are you doing ?
MARIA: I ca n't do this .
NURSE: I told you , the government pays . It 's all taken care of .
MARIA: No , you do n't understand . I ca n't .
NURSE: The doctor will give you something .
MARIA: I 'm not doing it .
NURSE: Honey , you 've made one mistake The remark stings Maria .
MARIA: Not like this one .
NURSE: Honey , look around you . The world does n't want one like that one .
MARIA: You do n't know what it will be !
NURSE: The child wo n't thank you !
ANTONIO: What 's wrong ? i > JEROME Of course , there was nothing wrong with me . Not so long ago I would have been considered
NURSE: The name ? For the certificate .
MARIA: Antonio
ANTONIO: No , Vincent Antonio .
MARIA: Oh , Vincent , Vincent , VincentI ca n't let you out of my sight .
GENETICIST: Put up the dish .
MARIA: We would like Vincent to have a brother you know , to play with .
GENETICIST: You 've already specified blue eyes , dark hair and fair skin . I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness , myopia , alcoholism and addictive susceptibility , propensity for violence and obesity
MARIA: We did n't wantdiseases , yes .
ANTONIO: We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance .
GENETICIST: You want to give your child the best possible
ANTONIO: He 's right , Maria . That 's right .
GENETICIST: Is there any reason you 'd want a left-handed child ?
ANTONIO: Er , no
ANTONIO: I like football .
GENETICIST: I have to warn you , Mr Luca , he 's going to be at least a head taller than you . Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time . Antonio beams proudly .
MARIA: We want himwe were hoping he would get married and have children . We 'd like grandchildren .
GENETICIST: I understand . That 's already been taken care of . Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extraI could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability .
MARIA: Antonio , the choir
GENETICIST: I have to caution you it 's not fool-proof .
ANTONIO: How much extra ?
GENETICIST: It would be five thousand more . Antonio 's face falls .
ANTONIO: I 'm sorry , there 's no way we can .
GENETICIST: Do n't worry . You 'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb . We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon .
MARIA: What will happen to the others ?
GENETICIST: They are not babies , Maria , merely `` human possibilities '' .
ANTON: How many astronauts are there , anyway ?
VINCENT: You 're standing on Venus .
MOTHER: Vincent , you have to be realistic . A heart condition like yours
VINCENT: I do n't care . I 'll take the risk .
ANTON: You sure you want to do this ?
ANTON: Why did n't you say anything ?
VINCENT: Why did n't you ? JEROME It confirmed everything in the minds of my parents - that they had taken the right course with my younger brother and the wrong course with me . It would have been so
CAESAR: When you clean the glass , Vincent , do n't clean it too well .
VINCENT: What do you mean ?
CAESAR: You might get ideas .
VINCENT: But if the glass is clean , it 'll be easie for you to see me when I 'm on the othe side of it . Caesar smiles at Vincent 's cockiness .
OWNER: Where 's Earl ?
JEROME: He fell . Lucky it was only the second floor .
GERMAN: Vincent , I 'm German That 's my name .
VINCENT: What do you think ?
GERMAN: I think I could do something provided you know what you 're doing and you can meet the terms .
CAESAR: I thought I told you not to get any ideas .
GERMAN: VincentVincent
VINCENT: German , is that you ?
GERMAN: Vincent , come down . I 've found him .
VINCENT: I hope he 's not just a body .
GERMAN: No problem . Before he dropped out he was an honor student , the right majors
VINCENT: How do I square the accident ?
GERMAN: It happened in Australasia . He checked in yesterday . No family complications , no ecord he ever broke his neck . As far as anybody 's concerned , he 's still a walking , talking , fully-productive member of society . You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life . Excuse me , your life .
VINCENT: Where is he ?
GERMAN: ( smiling confidently What did I tell you ? Which one 's the mirror ?
VINCENT: That 's the hair color in his profile ?
GERMAN: Yeah .
VINCENT: I 'd have to bleach my hair .
GERMAN: Why are you inventing problems ? You two are a couple of goddam clones . You look so right together , I want to double my fee .
VINCENT: How tall are you ?
EUGENE: Four foot six .
VINCENT: Okay , how tall did you used to be ?
EUGENE: Six one .
VINCENT: He 's too tall .
GERMAN: You can wear lifts .
VINCENT: Even with lifts I 'm never that tall .
GERMAN: There 's a way .
VINCENT: You okay , Jerome ?
EUGENE: Yeah . You want to go dancing tonight ? Vincent smiles .
VINCENT: What 's wrong with it ?
VINCENT: Suit yourself .
VINCENT: German .
EUGENE: You 're both going to a lot of trouble Maybe you can con somebody into believing you 're me to get your foot in the doorbut once you 're inside , you 're on your own . I 'm sure you 're sincere but I was being groomed for something like
VINCENT: I do n't know exactly , Jerome .
EUGENE: At least you 're honest . Call me by my middle nameEugeneIf you 're going to be Jerome , you may as well start getting used to it .
JEROME: I have to know where you come from .
EUGENE: If anybody asks , tell them the truth your family disowns you . You are a disappointment , Jerome .
JEROME: What about this ?
EUGENE: Wrong color . It 's silver . It 's not easy living up to this . Eugene wheels away .
JEROME: You had to be a right-hander .
EUGENE: Noone orders southpaws anymore .
GERMAN: It 's no good . I can see an edge . He may as well walk in there with a cane .
EUGENE: You really need that much ?
EUGENE: God , you 're serious , are n't you ?
JEROME: It 's not too late to back out .
EUGENE: You do n't know what a relief it is not to e me . Are you sure you want the job ?
EUGENE: Listen , I bag this stuff anyway . It may as well pay my rent .
TECHNICIAN: Congratulations .
JEROME: What about the interview ?
TECHNICIAN: That was it .
EMPLOYEE 1: Awful .
EMPLOYEE 2: Yeah , awful it did n't happen sooner .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: You 're lucky to be getting out of this .
JEROME: We 're still going ahead as planned ?
DIRECTOR JOSEF: The launch window is only open until week 's end . Tragic though this event may be , it has n't stopped the planets turning .
EMPLOYEE 3: What , no counselling ?
IRENE: Excuse me , Jerome . I 'm sorry to bother you .
JEROME: No bother .
IRENE: I 've been asked to compile a log for the investigatorsthey want to know everyone 's whereabouts last night .
JEROME: Last night ? I was at home . Irene makes a note with her stylus .
IRENE: Can that be , er , verified ? Were you alone ?
JEROME: No it ca n't be verified . Yes I was alone . Irene makes another note .
IRENE: I was at home .
JEROME: Were you alone ?
IRENE: Yes .
JEROME: So we do n't know for sure about you , either .
IRENE: No .
JEROME: Why do n't we say we were together ?
IRENE: Why would we do that ?
JEROME: I have better things to do this week than
EUGENE: You did n't forget the truffles ?
JEROME: The Mission Director .
EUGENE: You wish .
JEROME: They found him in his office this morning eaten so bad they had to check his nametag .
EUGENE: What an act of benevolencea service to the
JEROME: He was still warm when they confirmed .
EUGENE: This calls for a celebration . Does n't it ?
JEROME: The place is crawling with Hoovers .
EUGENE: So what ? You did n't kill him , did you ?
JEROME: That 's not the point .
TECHNICIAN: How old ?
YOUNG WOMAN: i > Me ? < /i
TECHNICIAN: The specimen .
TECHNICIAN: I 'll see what I can do .
JEROME: Not as much as I 'll miss your Stroganoff . I 'd like to take one of your chefs with me .
WAITRESS: I 'm so sorry . Did I hurt you ?
EUGENE: Honey , if you 'd hurt me , I 'd be cured .
JEROME: Let 's get out of here .
EUGENE: You 're right , there 's more atmosphere where you 're going .
JEROME: You drive .
EUGENE: I got ta stop ! ! I got ta stop ! !
JEROME: Keep going ! ! Keep going ! !
EUGENE: You idiot . You could ruin everything with a stunt like that .
JEROME: And drinking it . It 's like Evian by the time it 's filtered .
EUGENE: What is that one ?
JEROME: 11.15 to the port . A maintenance crew .
EUGENE: How long do you stay up there before you go ?
JEROME: A day or so .
EUGENE: I still ca n't believe they 're sending you to
JEROME: You should be going instead of me .
EUGENE: You know I 'm scared of heights .
ASSISTANT: The tongue is male . Mature . Blonse hair . Brown eyes . Light complexion . Between 5'11 and 6 ' 1 . Pronounced Caucasian nose . Thin lips . Weak chin . Lobeless ears . Prematurely balding . Slightly bow-legged . Broad shoulders . Barrel chest Blind .
INVESTIGATOR: i > Blind ? blind ? < /i
ASSISTANT: Who cuts out the tongue of a blind man ?
INVESTIGATOR: Someone who is mindful that the blind still speak .
JEROME: It 's okay , Eugene .
EUGENE: You know I was n't drunkI knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car
JEROME: What car ? Go to sleep .
EUGENE: I walked right in front of it . I was neve more sober in my life .
JEROME: It 's all right .
EUGENE: I 'm proud of you , Vincent . Eugene 's head falls back onto the pillow .
JEROME: You must be drunk to call me Vincent .
DETECTIVE HUGO: I do n't understand why you were dragged out here , Sir . It 's hardly worth wasting you timea no-nothing case like this .
INVESTIGATOR: A man 's dead , Detective .
INVESTIGATOR: Grudges ?
DETECTIVE HUGO: I look around , I see a lot of dry eyes . The Director was not universally loved . He was leading the cut-backs in the program . You 're looking at a room full of motives .
INVESTIGATOR: No , this is your man .
DETECTIVE HUGO: With respect , Sirit may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests
INVESTIGATOR: What about his profile ?
INVESTIGATOR: No . Not likely .
DETECTIVE HUGO: I 'll run a crossover on the eyelash fo any family or associate connections
INVESTIGATOR: I 've already run it . There 's no record of any living relative .
DETECTIVE HUGO: What a pity .
JEROME: Director , Napoleon 's helping me today . The Director regards both men suspiciously .
MEDICAL DIRECTOR: Well , you take it for him , Jerome .
NAPOLEON: Why did you do that ?
JEROME: Do n't worry about it .
LAMAR: Six miles later it 's still beating like a
INVESTIGATOR: How often do you test , Director ?
DIRECTOR JOSEF: Often .
INVESTIGATOR: Surely you know what you have .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: We have to be certain . Once they 're up , we can hardly turn the boat around .
INVESTIGATOR: We believe we have a suspect .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: What a relief .
INVESTIGATOR: This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor .
DETECTIVE HUGO: An age enhancement is being prepared as we speak .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: Irene will make it available to security .
CAESAR: I 'll take care of that for you , Mr Morrow . The two men exchange a conspiratorial smile .
JEROME: We were looking at each other . You stopped . Irene , also keeps her gaze ahead .
IRENE: I 'm sorry . I did n't mean anything .
JEROME: We were just looking .
IRENE: I know about you .
JEROME: Sorry , the wind caught it .
IRENE: Friend ?
JEROME: It was a mercy-killing after all .
IRENE: They found an eyelash .
JEROME: Where ?
IRENE: In the South Wing .
JEROME: Does it have a name ?
IRENE: Just some In-Valid . Vincent somebody .
JEROME: Perhaps we ought to celebrate , Irene .
IRENE: You celebrate , Jerome ?
EUGENE: I know what I ordered . I ordered `` Honey Dawn '' and you sent me `` Summer Wheat '' .
JEROME: We ca n't stay here .
EUGENE: What are you talking about ?
JEROME: They think I offed the Director .
EUGENE: What makes them think that ?
JEROME: They found my eyelash .
EUGENE: Where ?
JEROME: In a corridor .
EUGENE: Could be worse . They could have found it in your eye . Jerome half-smiles despite the situation .
JEROME: Come onwe 're taking off .
JEROME: You do n't understand , they 'll make the connection , they 'll hoover again . We should cut our losses .
EUGENE: Where is your head , Jerome ? You 're acting
JEROME: They 'll recognize me .
EUGENE: How could they recognize you ?
JEROME: I 'm sorry . I think I was crying . Eugene is uncomfortable at the notion .
EUGENE: Well save those tears .
JEROME: You really had other offers ?
EUGENE: I 'm sure I could have .
JEROME: Mind if I borrow a tie ?
EUGENE: So it 's not just the Hoovers who 've got you rattled .
EUGENE: Is that all ?
JEROME: I 've got enough on my mind without that .
EUGENE: If you say so . The stripe .
JEROME: Good choice .
EUGENE: I do n't feel too good . I think I 'm still drunk from last night .
JEROME: Never stopped you before . And for God 's sake stop plucking your hair . Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you would n't go bald .
EUGENE: If I were you I 'd worry about myself . Have n't you forgotten something ?
EUGENE: You got it , German .
GERMAN: You deserve it .
DETECTIVE HUGO: Not our fish , but sometihng stuck in the net .
DETECTIVE HUGO: This is the most likely location
INVESTIGATOR: There 's that word again . I have a feeling
DETECTIVE HUGO: With respect , Sir , many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes . Maybe he 's just unlucky .
INVESTIGATOR: I do n't like anybody this unlucky .
DETECTIVE HUGO: We 're already getting complaints about frivolous search .
INVESTIGATOR: This is a murder investigation . The public should be happy to co-operate , to get this disease off the streets .
IRENE: You did n't know ?
JEROME: Yesyes
IRENE: You 're angry
JEROME: Why would I be angry ? It was beautiful .
JOHN: Shit ! One of those Hoovers is back .
VALERIE: It 's alright . He 's here to see me .
VALERIE: Is that what keeps you coming back ?
INVESTIGATOR: You have so much wrong with you , you 'll e lucky to see next year .
VALERIE: Are you so much more alive , Investigator ?
INVESTIGATOR: I 'm not paying you to talk .
JEROME: Better not . Do n't want to give you a contaminated specimenif you get my meaning .
IRENE: I want to show you something .
JEROME: Come on . We 'll miss it .
IRENE: What did I tell you ?
JEROME: You 'll be next .
IRENE: I do n't think so . The only trip I 'll make in space is around the sun on this satellite right here . Irene turns to Jerome .
JEROME: What exactly is wrong ?
IRENE: Nothing yet . I 'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties .
JEROME: Of course .
EUGENE: How was your evening ?
JEROME: You know how it is with these altered births somebody told her she 's not going to live forever and she 's been preparing to die eve since .
EUGENE: You 're not thinking of telling her , are you ?
DETECTIVE HUGO: No . But one or two `` borrowed ladders '' have shown up there in the past .
INVESTIGATOR: Of course . He 's a `` de-gene-erate '' . He works at Gattaca . Why else would we find
DETECTIVE HUGO: It 's still possible the eyelash specimen came
DETECTIVE HUGO: It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers . You 've seen thei security system . They know who works there . Even if you ignore the man 's expiration date , his profile suggests that he does n't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals .
INVESTIGATOR: Do n't underestimate these imposters .
DETECTIVE HUGO: None of the ID photos match the enhancement .
DETECTIVE HUGO: You know their workforce . Two-thirds at least fall into the category . We 'll be closing down their operation for days . At least go with a fingertip sample or urine .
INVESTIGATOR: Blood . From the vein .
CAESAR: Look like anybody to you ?
YOUNGER JANITOR: Not to me .
CAESAR: Ugly sonofabitch though , is n't he ?
DIRECTOR JOSEF: Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is the key .
MISSION COMMANDER: Even someone as advanced as Jerome will be last year 's model by the time we 're done .
JEROME: I would n't get your hopes up , Commander . Irene enters the craft .
IRENE: Excuse me , Mr Morrow . The investigators have egun their testing .
DETECTIVE JOSEF: This is so inconvenient , Irene . They can make an exception for Jerome .
IRENE: I 'm afraid not .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: I apologize , Jerome .
JEROME: It 's not yor fault , Director . If your predecessor were still around we may not be going to Gaspra at all . That 's what I would call inconvenient . Jerome exits the craft with Irene .
JEROME: Damn ! !
LAMAR: JesusI 'm sorry , Jerome .
JEROME: You must be out of practise , Lamar .
LAMAR: I 've got enough here .
IRENE: So you did n't do it after all .
JEROME: I guess somebody beat me to it .
DETECTIVE HUGO: That 's the last .
INVESTIGATOR: Something 's not right .
DETECTIVE HUGO: He 's not here . It 's a blind alley .
INVESTIGATOR: No , we 've missed something . We Hoover again .
DETECTIVE HUGO: We do n't have the manpower .
INVESTIGATOR: Get it . From outside , if you have to .
DETECTIVE HUGO: From what budget ?
DIRECTOR JOSEF: Would you care to lookin the telescope ?
INVESTIGATOR: Thank you , no .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: One look through there and you would know why
INVESTIGATOR: You 're so unconcerned that you have a kille in your midst .
EUGENE: Where are we going ?
JEROME: I 'm sorry . I 've got plans .
EUGENE: Again ?
JEROME: She 's already got her doubts . I have to act like nothing 's wrong .
EUGENE: I 'm sure you 'll be very convincing . Jerome ignores the remark .
JEROME: Michael 's . Eugene looks at him askance .
EUGENE: You may as well invite her here .
JEROME: Will you be okay ?
EUGENE: Do n't worry about your little pin cushion . To be honest , I 'm looking forward to having the place to myself .
JEROME: We 'll still be able to talk when I 'm away .
EUGENE: How long ?
JEROME: By the time I 'm at the Belt , you phone and say , `` How are you ? '' Forty-five minutes later I reply , `` Not bad . How are you ? ''
EUGENE: I guess I 'd better have something important
IRENE: What is this place ?
JEROME: You 've never been here ? Let me order for you .
IRENE: I 'd better not .
JEROME: So sure of what you ca n't do . Do you even know what it tastes like , Irene ? Irene goes to deny it but can not .
MICHAEL: Take the side door .
DETECTIVE: Check for lenses , hairpieces
IRENE: Why are we leaving ?
JEROME: Those checks take forever .
IRENE: Jerome !
JEROME: Let 's walk .
IRENE: Who are they ?
IRENE: I ca n't .
JEROME: Come on .
IRENE: My medication . I left it back there .
JEROME: We 'll get it later . Irene , please .
INVESTIGATOR: You run a clean establishment .
MICHAEL: Are you a health inspector ?
INVESTIGATOR: Do you recognize this man ?
MICHAEL: My eyes are n't so good .
INVESTIGATOR: I bet .
HUGO: Sir . The Investigator hurries to him .
INVESTIGATOR: Did he hit you with his fist ?
DETECTIVE: More like a hammer .
INVESTIGATOR: Do n't touch your face . Do n't swallow . Do n't spit . Quick , clean his teeth .
IRENE: Are you trying to kill me ? Are you ? ! Do n't you understand , I ca n't do that !
JEROME: You just did .
INVESTIGATOR: What are you waiting for ?
DETECTIVE HUGO: Where do we start ?
INVESTIGATOR: We 'll vacuum these streets if we have to .
DETECTIVE: We caught them trying to flush these , Sir .
IRENE: So sure of what you ca n't do . Jerome follows her inside .
JEROME: You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron ? It 's the exact height of the front fender . Looked right instead of left .
IRENE: So you 're not so smart after all . I want you to knowif it ever came to it I 'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg
IRENE: You hypocrite . Do you think for one moment you 'd be doing what you 're doing if it was n't
INVESTIGATOR: Why not ?
HUGO: These new personality corrections I 've been eading about .
INVESTIGATOR: You worried about the cost ?
HUGO: Not that .
INVESTIGATOR: They said the same thing about myopia and obesity . You think your children would be less human if they were less violent , angry ,
DETECTIVE: Do n't touch that . It 's evidence .
DETECTIVE HUGO: Positive saliva match . The cup was definitely used since the original sweep .
INVESTIGATOR: So we have two choices . Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of
DIRECTOR JOSEF: Twelve have a mission within the week .
IRENE: What is it ?
JEROME: I forgot somethingsomething at home . I 'll see you later .
IRENE: I 'll miss you . Jerome is still focussed on the entranceway .
JEROME: We could go together one day .
DETECTIVE HUGO: He 's the only absentee .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: A little nausea . Quite common .
INVESTIGATOR: At least it 's nothing contagious .
DIRECTOR JOSEF: I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission . We 're already counting ackwards .
IRENE: I 'll call and let him know .
INVESTIGATOR: Let 's not spoil the surprise . I understand you can show us the way .
EUGENE: Hello ?
INVESTIGATOR: You do n't know who he is , do you , Irene ? He hands her the pill box found in Michael 's .
IRENE: Jerome ?
EUGENE: Hello , sweatheart . Come on up .
IRENE: Good to see you 're feeling better .
IRENE: It 's about the Director .
EUGENE: Again ?
IRENE: Could n't we do this another time ?
INVESTIGATOR: I do n't believe so .
DETECTIVE HUGO: This wo n't take a moment .
INVESTIGATOR: Mind if I take a leak ?
EUGENE: As long as you do n't do it in my closet . Over there .
INVESTIGATOR: May I ?
EUGENE: Clean the whole house if you want .
IRENE: Actually , the kitchen needs doing .
DETECTIVE: Come quickly . We have him .
JEROME: How are you , Jerome ?
EUGENE: Not bad , Jerome .
JEROME: How the hell did you get here .
EUGENE: I could always walk . I 've been faking it .
JEROME: Irene . Jerome goes to follow but Eugene stops him .
INVESTIGATOR: This ca n't be him .

INVESTIGATOR: Luca could still be an accomplice .
INVESTIGATOR: Hugo ! I 've found him !
HUGO: I 've found him too .
INVESTIGATOR: A fingerprint . There 's something to be said for nostalgia . What did you find ?
DETECTIVE HUGO: It 's not exactly him .
INVESTIGATOR: Where did you get this ?
DETECTIVE HUGO: But this man does share some common characteristics with your suspect . Not so
CAESAR: So you 've finally seen sense and come back to your old job , Vincent .
JEROME: Not yet , I 'm afraid .
CAESAR: No ? What 's keeping you ?
JEROME: I guess I 'm a slow learner .
CAESAR: I guess so . Well , while you 're up there , maybe you could tidy the place up a bit .
JEROME: I 'll see what I can do .
JEROME: By the way , I left some trash in your locker .
CAESAR: I 'll take care of it .
INVESTIGATOR: Vincent
JEROME: From Vincent .

JEROME: You almost sound like you believe that .
ANTON: Come with me now , Vincent . You 've gone as fa as you can go .
JEROME: There are a few million miles to go yet .
ANTON: It 's over .
JEROME: Is that the only way you can succeed , Anton , to see me fail ?
ANTON: It 's for the best .
JEROME: Who are you trying to convince ?
ANTON: I will prove it to you . Come swim with me now , Vincent . Nowtonight .
IRENE: Hello .
EUGENE: That 's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded .
IRENE: I 've been looking for him . Do you know where he is ?
EUGENE: He 's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes .
IRENE: What 's wrong with him ?
EUGENE: You have more in common than you know . Irene 's hand involuntarily goes to her heart .
ANTON: How are you doing this , Vincent ? How have you done any of this ?
JEROME: Now is your chance to find out .
JEROME: You wanted to know how I did it . That 's how I did it , Anton . I never saved anything for the swim back .
IRENE: Sorry , the wind caught it .
JEROME: A year is a long time .
IRENE: Not so longjust once around the sun .
EUGENE: I have your samples ready .
JEROME: Have you forgotten ? I do n't need any samples where I 'm going .

KINNEAR: Nasty way to go .
CARTER: Yes .
HARRY: Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days ?
KINNEAR: Harry ! Jack , I do n't want to be ude , but these men have brought a lot of money with them . Glenda , you do n't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses . Give him the bloody ottle . Now , where are we ? Harry keeps a cold , wary eye on him .

CARTER: You would n't .
EDNA: How 'd you know I would n't ?
CARTER: 'Cos I know you wear purple underwear .

He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street , I had to tell Frank I could n't see him any more . It was getting too dodgy . That was on Sunday . He said he 'd kill himself . I was frightened what you might do .
CARTER: I do n't believe you , Margaret . Frank was n't like that . I 'm the villain in the family , emember ?
MARGARET: It 's the truth .
CARTER: You bloody whore . Frank was too careful to die like that . Who killed him ?

BRUMBY: A new venture of mine . It 's going to be a restaurant . Do you like it ?
CARTER: Yes .
BRUMBY: Last night , after you 'd gone , I did a little bit of asking around . Seeing as you were n't very forthcoming , It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother ? I got to thinking it would e nice if the bloke you were afte was the same bloke I wanted off my ack , You know my life . Machines . The arcades . Nice business . Looks afte itself . People put money in . I take it out . Not much rough stuff . It 's a business that makes me very happy . But recently , I 've had a spot of bother , One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that 's already got some . The upshot is I 've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs . So far as I 'm concerned , that 's it . Apparently not . These people I 've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit , So I 'm worried . I ca n't fight them — I have n't that kind of set-up . But I 've got to fix them before they fix me . Trouble is , if I try and they find out , I 'm dead .
CARTER: What name ?
BRUMBY: Kinnear . Cyril Kinnear . Kinnear did it .
CARTER: Why ?
BRUMBY: I do n't know . All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday . You other 's name was mentioned . Next day , he was dead .
CARTER: Why ?
BRUMBY: I do n't know . That 's all I was told .
CARTER: That 's not good enough .
BRUMBY: Christ , what
CARTER: Do me a favour . You do n't really expect me to fix Kinnear on you say-so ? Just because they tried to get me on you last night , do n't think you can pull the same trick . Stroll on .
BRUMBY: Jack , you 're wrong .
CARTER: Good afternoon , Mr Brumby . Carte exits .
BRUMBY: Jack
CARTER: Who 's setting you up in this place ?
GLENDA: Brumby .
CARTER: Is he coming here ?
GLENDA: Do n't worry . He 's meeting the architects at the restaurant . Carter plays with her hair .
CARTER: Are n't you scared Kinnear will find out ?
GLENDA: He wo n't . He thinks I 'm simple . Carter kisses her neck .
CARTER: What does he want that bloody great country place for ?
GLENDA: Entertaining .
CARTER: What kind of entertaining ?
GLENDA: Now you 're asking .
CARTER: Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap ?
GLENDA: Especially when I play the lead . Carter wraps his arms about her .
CARTER: Did Kinnear say anything ? Afte I 'd left the other night ? Glenda sits up sharply .
GLENDA: That 's why you waited for me .
CARTER: Not entirely . No .
GLENDA: You sure about that ?
CARTER: Sure I 'm sure .
GLENDA: You bastard .
CARTER: I want to give you an Oscar .
GLENDA: You 've been watching the film .
CARTER: Tell me about the girl .
GLENDA: What girl ?
CARTER: The young girl . Who pulled her ?
GLENDA: I do n't know .
CARTER: Was it Albert ?
GLENDA: Should n't think so .
CARTER: Is it one of Kinnear 's films ?
GLENDA: Yeah .
CARTER: Who set it up ? Eric ?
GLENDA: Yeah .
CARTER: Then he must have pulled her .
GLENDA: Expect so .
CARTER: Did my brother Frank find out ?
GLENDA: Your brother ? What you talking about ?
CARTER: You 're a lying bitch .
GLENDA: The girl 's name was Doreen . That 's all I know .
CARTER: And you did n't know her last name ?
GLENDA: No .
CARTER: Well , it 's Carter . That 's my name , And her father was my brother . And he was murdered last Sunday . Now get up and get dressed . He pushes her ahead of him .
ALBERT: Hello , Jack , I do n't know anything , Jack .
CARTER: Yes , you do , Albert . Talk or I 'll kill you .
ALBERT: I know . I know .
CARTER: Do you want to go to the toilet , Albert ? At first Albert does n't understand .
ALBERT: I know .
CARTER: Did Eric Pake pull her ?
ALBERT: Yes .
CARTER: How ?
ALBERT: I dunno . He 's got his ways . He knows Margaret .
CARTER: When did you find out ?
ALBERT: A couple of weeks back .
CARTER: How ?
ALBERT: No choice . I had a visit from somebody .
CARTER: Who ?
ALBERT: Cliff Brumby . He 'd seen the film . He wanted to meet Doreen .
CARTER: And you told Brumby ? Albert nods .
ALBERT: Last Sunday afternoon , Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he 's rumbled . Somehow , he 's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off . They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat . I thought they 'd just duff him up a bit . Honest .
CARTER: What did you do ? Albert ?
ALBERT: Nothing . What could I do ?
CARTER: Did Eric know that Frank was my other ?
ALBERT: Yes . I told him .
CARTER: What did he say ?
ALBERT: 'Good . ' Albert draws deeply on his cigarette . They drove Frank away in a car .
CARTER: Is that all there is ? Albert nods .
ALBERT: Jack , for Christ 's sake He falls to his knees .
CARTER: You knew what I 'd do .
ALBERT: Yes , but listen . Christ , I did n't kill him .
CARTER: I know you did n't kill him . I know you did n't .
ERIC: No shooters . Cyril said no shooters , you stupid bastard .
PETER: Get stuffed . He 's reloading .
CON: Gerald wants to see him first .
PETER: Shut up . Carter is listening to all this .
CARTER: Are you coming in ? Or do we piss about all day ? Eric laughs .
ERIC: You 're finished , Jack . You know that , do n't you ? I 've bloody finished you .
CARTER: Not till I 'm dead , Eric . Eric laughs .
ERIC: Oh , you 've still got your sense of humour ? Tell him how I 've fixed him , Con .
CON: He 's told Gerald about you and Anna .
ERIC: Did n't believe us at first , did he , Con ? Then Peter talked to him .
PETER: Did n't even say goodbye . Just asked us to take you back - alive .
ERIC: He 's probably talking to her right now . Are you still going to fancy her when Gerald 's finished with her face ?
CARTER: Stay where you are , Peter .
PETER: Do n't .
ERIC: Carter , your car needs a wash .
BRUMBY: I do n't want them cooking in here . You can put a hatch in that wall .
CARTER: You should n't have shown the film to Frank .
BRUMBY: I had to . It was the only way I could get at them .
CARTER: The guy on the swing-bridge ?
FIRST WOMAN: They do n't know how it happened .
SECOND WOMAN: How far did he fall ?
FIRST WOMAN: What did Betty say Ninety floors , I think it was .
SECOND WOMAN: Really . Was he dead ?
FIRST WOMAN: Oh , yes .
SECOND WOMAN: Better to go quick like that .
CARTER: I 've come for you , Margaret .
ERIC: Gerald Fletcher wants a word with you Cyril . Kinnear crosses to the telephone .
KINNEAR: Hello , Gerald .
CARTER: It 's Carter . Listen carefully , you hairy-faced git . I 've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time . All it takes is one call to the police .
KINNEAR: Really ? So ?
CARTER: I 'll do a simple deal with you . All I want is
KINNEAR: I see . I think that can be arranged . Kinnear continues listening .
CARTER: but I do n't want him there until six in the morning . OK ? Right .
ERIC: You want something , Cyril ?
KINNEAR: Yes , Eric . A word with you .
CARTER: Get out .
KINNEAR: I want you to listen very carefully . Jack Carter , You know what he looks like ?
MAN: Yes .
CARTER: You could n't win an egg and spoon ace , Eric .
ERIC: Sod off .
CARTER: Stay away from the car or I 'll low you apart .
ERIC: Still got your sense of humour .
CARTER: Drink up , Eric . Drink up . I want you to drink all of that . Do you understand ? Drink up . Just like it was with my brother , Frank . Go on , son . Drink up .
BUS H: Just a boy , that 's all .

HORTON: Sir.. my mother used to say that gossip is the devil 's radio..

BUS H: I paid .
HORTON: Well.. you ca n't buy forgiveness , Mr. Bush . It 's free . But you do have to ask for it .
BUSH: Nothing in this world is free , preacher .
HORTON: That was , uh , different .
KATHRYN: I heard such awful things about him when I was a kid .
HORTON: My mother probably told you some of them .
BONNIE: What are you doing , son ?
GARY: Look at that . A mule drinking coffee !
CARL: Finally found somebody that likes Bonnie 's coffee .
WORKER: Ya 'll better hush , that 's old Bush .
CARL: Hey..
NO RESPONSE: I 'm talking to you..
CARL: We know about you . You stay out of this diner . There 's women and children here and we do n't want you around them .

BUDDY: Well yeah but this time it was with that old man Bush .
FRANK: Old man ?
DISTANTLY HOPEFUL: Is there a body ?
BUDDY: No , the old man did the beating . Never seen anything like it .
FRANK: Social event of the year and I missed it .
BUDDY: What ?
FRANK: People are dying in bunches . Everywhere . But here . He puts the paper down and studies his socks .
BUDDY: Well..
FRANK: Onethingabout Chicago , people knowhowto die ; they drown , get unover , shot , whatever it takes .
BUDDY: We get it done down here , we 're just not in a hurry about it .
FRANK: It 's them or us .
QUIETLY: I might know someone who is looking for a funeral . Frank 's eyes crawl over to him .
FRANK: How much did he have ?
BUDDY: It was all wadded up .
FRANK: Ooo , hermit money . That 's good . Buddy sees Bush 's signs .
BUDDY: There it is..
FRANK: You 've been wanting a shot at sales..
BUDDY: But..
FRANK: As of right now , you 're on commission . Remember ; foot in the door , establish trust , and drop the hammer .
BUDDY: I 'd feel better if you 'd go too .
FRANK: No doubt but if you do n't do this y yourself , you wo n't know if you 're any good . And you 'll neve e any good if you do n't know you are . Go get him !
BUDDY: Hello ?
BUSH: Want to see in my house , do you ?
BUDDY: Oh , Katie..
BUS H: You was at the church with you wife and baby .
BUDDY: Yes , sir .
BUSH: What the hell you doing here ?
BUDDY: I ca n't remember .
BUSH: What ? They stand there while Buddy thinks..
BUDDY: Oh yeah , I heard.. you wanted a funeral .
BUSH: Funeral ?
BUS H: You like rabbit ?
BUDDY: What ? Bush goes inside .
BUSH: Sit down .
BUDDY: I.. I do n't know , sir .

BUDDY: Did you make this furniture , sir ? Never seen any like it . Ca n't even tell what 's holding it up .
BUSH: Magic .
BUDDY: Alright . Well . Sir , if you do want to plan for a funeral service , which I hope will be a long long time away , we 'd treat you with espect and offer a good..
BUSH: What 'd everybody say about what happened in town ?
BUDDY: I don't..
BUSH: That crazy old son of a bitch tried to beat a man to death for no eason ? That it ?
BUDDY: There 's two sides to every story .
BUSH: People say that . But they do n't mean it . They think what they think and they do n't want to know anything else .
BUDDY: Yes , sir , but I think people are so scared of what they do n't know that they make things up to feel bette about it .
BUSH: Like life after dying . Heaven .
THINKS: I hope that part 's true , do n't you ?
BEAT: But I do n't think we know the actual truth about much of anything . I know I do n't . I 'm just guessing most of the time .
BUDDY: Lord , that 's good..
BUS H: You boys been coming out here to throw rocks through my window fo 20-30 years .
BUDDY: I never..
BUSH: Ya 'll know lots of stories about me ?
SQUIRMS: Yes , sir , I guess , but..
BUSH: Tell one .
BUDDY: I 'd rather not .
BUSH: I rather you did .
BUDDY: Well . When I was kid I heard you killed some men in a fist fight .
BUSH: Is that all ? Bush leans back stone-faced .
BUS H: What 's your name again ?
BUDDY: Buddy Robinson , sir .
BUS H: Well , if I need you I know where you are .
FRANK: .state law requires.. No ma'am , we ca n't bury him under the house..
TO BUSH: Would you like to come in , sir ?
BUSH: Leave it .
FRANK: Yes , Ma'am , but there 's lots of natural things that are n't decent . He did what ? ! Good God . No , Ma'am , I did n't know that about you husband . Well , yeah now I understand why you want him unde the house but still..
BUDDY: Frank Quinn , Mr. Bush .
FRANK: Come in , come in , pleasure . Coffee ?

FRANK: A little bit of everywhere , I guess . Get him a chair , Buddy ! Buddy stands behind the waiting chair .
BUSH: I 'm after a funeral .
FRANK: Boy , are you in luck .
GETTING UP: Follow me .

FRANK: Burial plot..
BUSH: Got it .
FRANK: A service ?

BUSH: A party .
BUDDY: What kind of party ?
BUSH: Funeral party .
FRANK: We can do that .
BUSH: And I want to be there .
FRANK: You will be , I guarantee it .
BUSH: I want to be there now .
BUDDY: You want to be at your funeral.. party.. alive ? But.. it 's not a funeral if you 're not , you know , deceased..
FRANK: Hold on now , it 's a detail , we can look at it .
BUDDY: Pretty big detail .
FRANK: So you 'd like to have a funeral party while you 're alive so you can go ?
BUSH: Yes or no ?
FRANK: Yes . Buddy is lost .
BUSH: Sit down . Buddy sits right down .
FRANK: Say again .
BUDDY: That probably covers 4 counties..
BUSH: Then I want 4 counties worth of people at the party .
FRANK: Well , sir , the thing is , how would you get people to come and tell stories about you that I 'm guessing might get them , you know.. shot ?
BUDDY: Like what ?
MATTIE: Felix ? !
BUSH: Hey Mattie .
MATTIE: I 've been back a while .
LOOKING AWAY: Well .
MATTIE: How are you ?
BUSH: You look like you always did . He abruptly rips himself away and is gone .
FRANK: How would she know him ?
BUDDY: What ?
FRANK: What do you mean , what ? Goddamn all of money ! He wants a party with pink balloons on his ears , we 're gon na give it to him .
BUDDY: But..
FRANK: I sold 26 of the ugliest cars eve made one December , in Chicago , with wind blowing so hard up my ass I was farting snow flakes in July so do n't tell me we ca n't do this .
BUDDY: But..
FRANK: That 's the last `` but '' I want to hear out of you . You 're a salesman now , sell !
MATTIE: A thousand years ago he was the most interesting man I 'd ever met .
KATHRYN: Get out of here .
MATTIE: He was . And I do n't mean just the way he looked .
KATHRYN: I hope not .
MATTIE: Oh no , listen , he was beautiful .
KATHRYN: Are you serious ?
KATHRYN: Good Lord , you had a crush on him !
MATTIE: All the girls did . I know he 's something wild that crawls out of the hills once in a while and gets into trouble now but there 's still nobody like him .
FRANK: We have a plan . All we need is a little bit of your time .
BUSH: What for ?
BUDDY: Seeing it is better than hearing about it .
BUSH: How much is it gon na cost ?
TO BUDDY: Did you say anything about money ? I did n't say anything about money .
TO BUSH: If we ca n't get you what you want you do n't owe us anything .
BUSH: It moves , do n't it ?
DISTRACTED: This is nothing .
BUSH: Fancy car for the dead .
FRANK: Did n't buy it for them .
BUDDY: We say that funerals are `` For the Living '' but we forget what that means sometimes , I guess . ( to Bush but almost to
HIMSELF: I was thinking about your funeral party before I went to sleep last night and I think I understand it a little now . When I was a kid , my folks where killed in a bad ca wreck and the people at the funeral home they did the impossible as far as I was concerned . I do n't know what I would 've done without them . And I remember wishing that my mother and daddy were there to see how beautiful they made everything .
FRANK: Where 's he going ?
TO BUSH: I wish you would n't do that yet .
BUSH: Do n't leave me naked .
FRANK: Mr. Bush , you can get all the hairs cut you want after we take you picture , I 'll pay for it .
BUSH: Why you want my picture made ?
BUDDY: That 's what we 're trying to tell you . We 're gon na run an ad in some papers about your party and put up posters of you .
BUSH: And you want me to look like this ?
FRANK: Yes .
BUSH: Why ?
FRANK: Why ?
BUDDY: It 's how people recognize you , sir .
FRANK: And you want as many people to come as possible so..
BUSH: So a crazy old nutter draws more .
FRANK: Basically . Do n't you think ?
BUSH: Do you ever say what you mean ?
FRANK: Take it . I 'd go see that .
GENUINELY SURPRISED: Damn . You look pretty good.. Bush suddenly gets up and nods at Frank .
BUSH: He 's paying .
FRANK: Son of a bitch , it 's almost worth it .
TO BUDDY: What do you think ?
BUDDY: I would n't know you , sir .
BUSH: Maybe the Devil wo n't either . Might work out .
TO FRANK: Where 's the shoes ?
FRANK: Well , normally people do n't wea shoes in a casket so.. .what are you , about a 10D ?
BUSH: She 's a peach .
HORTON: `` The Lord loves a cheerful giver.. ''
MATTIE: Oh please.. you think the Lord 's taking sides in a poker game in a funeral home ?
FRANK: If He is , the Divine 's cheating .
RAY: Exactly .
FRANK: Do n't agree with me Ray , it makes me doubt myself .
RAY: I would have turned down your loan if you were my own dear mother , Frank .
FRANK: You made my point and do n't even know it .
MATTIE: Jesus , would you two stop it ! You 're worse than two old women..
TO FRANK: What were you doing with that old astard in town today , anyway ?
RAY: Oh yes . Buying him clothes , getting him a haircut..on credit . Frank shoots him a look .
HORTON: Took out ads in a bunch of papers too , something about a party ?
FRANK: God , I love small towns .
MATTIE: Who are you talking about ?
RAY: That hermit , what 's his name..
FRANK: `` Felix '' Bush .
MATTIE: You 're giving him a party ?
FRANK: A funeral party .
MATTIE: Whatever you 're drinking is not eing good to you at all .
CARL: What the hell is a funeral party ?
FRANK: Hey , the man wants to be at his own funeral . What can I say ? I 'd like to be at my funeral so I could tell my ex-wife to kiss my..
MATTIE: What makes you think she 'd show up for you ?
FRANK: Because , Dear , vultures are constitutionally unable to ignore the dead . Mattie grins which delights Frank , no end .
HORTON: It 's that big wad of money of his you 're after .
RAY: What money is that ?
MATTIE: Felix has money ?
HORTON: He came to see me , wanting a funeral , had a big old greasy ball of money . Talked like he thought he could buy his way to heaven with it .
SERIOUSLY: How much has he got ? Maybe he can .
MATTIE: Is he sick , Gus ?
CARL: I 'll tell you one damn thing , ai n't nobody gon na go to a funeral fo that son of a bitch . Mattie gives Carl a look
HORTON: Language..
FRANK: They might . He 's inviting everyone who has a story about him to come . You could tell about him kicking your ass , Carl .
RAY: Old man is going to ride the Weird Train right into the ground , is n't he ?
FRANK: Would n't you like to know what everybody says about you behind your back , Ray ? Yeah , probably not .
HORTON: I already know way more about people than I need to .
MATTIE: Or want to .
HORTON: Amen .
FRANK: Let 's play some cards .
RAY: Oh for God 's sake , face it Frank , you 're broke .
FRANK: It 's who has it last that counts .
CARL: Say what you want but if there had n't been anybody there the othe day he would 've killed me . And I guarantee you it would n't have been his first time .
MATTIE: Everybody knows you started it . Do n't look at me like that . I emember when you were born . You were the sweetest little boy . What is wrong with you ?
CARL: I made a mistake . But there 's a line.. and he crossed it.. and everybody knows that too . Ya 'll go on and have a party with the devil for his money but I 'll dance on his grave someday .
HORTON: You kind of hate to admit it when it comes to Carl but he 's got a point . You do n't know what Bush is doing . What if he just wants to get everybody in one place so he can turn his shotgun on them ?
MATTIE: He wouldn't..
HORTON: I looked in his eyes . The truth is nobody knows what he 's capable of . Maybe even he does n't know .
RAY: Go ahead and lay your watch down , Frank . But I am going to keep it this time , alright , on principle .
FRANK: I got an idea . Let 's try something different .
TO RAY: The cards in your sock ? Leave'em there . Everyone freezes . Ray shakes his head .
RAY: What are you trying to pull now ?
FRANK: You really think you 're that good that nobody sees ?
RAY: Sees what ?
FRANK: You cheat at everything you do . Even at the bank , you loan people just enough to get'em deeper in so you can foreclose on them .
RAY: You are a pathetic man . And a goddamn..
FRANK: Am I ? Then stand up and roll down your socks . Stand up or I 'll stand you up .
MATTIE: No . Thank you .
HURT: You sure ? You 're not going to play anymore , are you ?
MATTIE: Oh , I do n't know . Thank you fo inviting me though .
FRANK: I 'm sorry about the..we do n't always fight , okay , we do , but he 's had that coming for..
MATTIE: It 's not that . I just..
FRANK: You came because you do n't know what to do with yourself . I slept on the same side of the bed my whole life , right ? But after my wife left me , I switched sides , just like that , and never been able to go back .
MATTIE: When someone you love is gone , you can pour everything , even a lifetime of things into the place where they were but it 's still always empty .
KATHRYN: I did n't hear him wake up .
BUDDY: He did n't .
KNEELING DOWN: Everything 's all right , hon .
BUDDY: I 'm glad you do n't know how quick it can change .
MATTIE: Good Lord . Have you completely lost your mind ?
ANNOUNCER: Friends , we have a treat for you today on WCGM . Our special guest is going to tell us about an event that everyone is talking about . And here he is , Mr. Felix Bush , the mysterious hermit of Caleb County ! How are you today , sir ?
BUSH: I am .
ANNOUNCER: So tell us , sir , exactly how did you come up with the idea of having a funeral party before you die ?
BUSH: I dreamed it .
ANNOUNCER: Really ?
BUSH: Why would I make that up ?
ANNOUNCER: Okay . Now I have to say that you do n't look quite like you do on the posters .
BUSH: I got pruned .
ANNOUNCER: Well , you 're a bit of a local legend , sir . I was a little nervous about our interview . I 've heard some pretty wild stories..
BUSH: Like what ?
ANNOUNCER: Well uh , just.. from what I understand , you want everyone who has a story about you to come and tell it . Is that right ?
BUSH: You come and tell yours .
ANNOUNCER: Thank you . Now how long have you een living out there by yourself ?
BUSH: Come to the funeral and maybe you 'll find out .
ANNOUNCER: You heard it here on WCGM , folks , find out the answer to the mystery February 16..
BUSH: One more thing , boy . FRANK and Buddy tense . What 's this ?
ANNOUNCER: For 5 dollars ?
BUSH: Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home .
ANNOUNCER: You heard him ! If you want a chance to win 300 acres of virgin timbe worth thousands and thousands of dollars , send 5 dollars along with your name and address to.. Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home .
TO BUSH: I could almost kiss you on the mouth !
ANNOUNCER: I 'll take a ticket .
BUDDY: You 're betting on a man dying..
ANNOUNCER: I did n't mean it like..
FRANK: Hey , it 's his idea !
TO BUDDY: Buy a ticket , son .
BUSH: Mattie ?
MATTIE: Felix ?
BUSH: Was n't nowhere else to go .
MATTIE: I heard you on the radio .
BUSH: Well .
MATTIE: You 've gotten downright chatty .
BUSH: I reckon so .
GLANCING AROUND: This is nice . I drove by a few times after I got back but..
BUSH: You want to see it ?
MATTIE: Do you want me to ?
BUSH: You always know where you stand with a dog . Want to lay here with them someday if they 'll have me .
MATTIE: It really is beautiful . Probably looked like this everywhere a hundred years ago .
BUSH: You leave things alone , they know what to do .
MATTIE: Like you ?
BUSH: No , Ma'am . I do n't know what to do about anything much .
MATTIE: You 've been alone a long time .
BUSH: Some people are more suited to it than others , I reckon .
MATTIE: That 's funny cause I never thought that it 'd suit you . I knew you would n't be like anybody else but.. no one to talk to , no one to.. be with.. never .
BUSH: How you sleeping these days , girl ?
MATTIE: How am I what ?
BUSH: You sleep good ?
MATTIE: No , not lately . How 'd you know ?
BUSH: Chamomile , it 's good when the nights get long . Helps you nod off . She takes it and smiles up at him .
MATTIE: Yes .
BUSH: Would you stay for supper ?
MATTIE: I do n't want to be any trouble .
BUSH: A supper guest every 30-40 years is not much trouble , Girl .
MATTIE: Alright then . He holds out his arm .
BUSH: Better stay close , some big old wild cats been eating my chickens.. She looks around and takes his arm .
MATTIE: You always were good with you hands .
BUSH: You still play the piano ?
MATTIE: I teach a few girls .
BUSH: I got a good feeling when you played . Remember that time you was playing and the lamp burned out ? And you went right on in the dark ? I hear that song sometimes at night .
MATTIE: Sure is quiet out here .
BUSH: What ?
MATTIE: I said it's.. I tried to write you at times but I did n't know what to say .
BUSH: Well . I heard you married .
MATTIE: He was a Doctor ; a real good man . We lived in St. Louis for awhile . He died unexpectedly about a yea ago . I came back here because.. I have no idea why .
BUSH: You have a tender heart , always did . She gives him a curious look .
MATTIE: And there 's no getting over some things either , is there ?
BUSH: Reckon not , Little Bit .
MATTIE: Little Bit ? ! Oh my God , nobody 's called me that in..
FRANK: Jesus , kid !
BUDDY: Yeah ! But , but it 's not our money .
FRANK: Well yeah , no , but some of it 's gon na be ! We 're putting this thing on !
BUDDY: He should be here . I 'm gon na go get him .
FRANK: I do n't know exactly how much you land 's worth but looks to me like you could get maybe 10 times that or more . I do n't know what to do with it . I mean it 's yours to do with what you want but I 'm getting a little nervous about it . Neve thought I 'd see enough money to make me nervous . We should probably talk about the price fo everything , the clothes , the ads , the food and drink for the party , the music.. our fee for everything , we 'll be fair about that , I 'm not worried about it .
BUSH: What do you think , boy ? Buddy jerks , looks at Frank , at Bush .
BUDDY: Money makes people do funny things . Frank scowls .
FRANK: No ! Ray is not.. I mean , if it was my money I 'd put it in a bank out of town so everyone did n't know my business . This bank here , you ca n't trust , that 's all I 'm saying .
BUSH: Can I trust you ?
FRANK: Every name , every dollar , is right there !
BUSH: Not what I asked .
FRANK: I 've done a hell of a job for you . I do n't see why..
BUDDY: Mr. Bush , I did n't mean to imply..
BUSH: Hush .
FRANK: I 've sold horses , cars , houses , hell , pocket watches pinned to the inside of my coat . I 'm not ashamed of it . I do n't rob banks , do n't cheat at cards , and I sleep all ight the nights I sleep . What was the question.. ?
BUSH: They goddamn..
WALKING OUT: I 'll be at the car .
FRANK: Is it just me or is he extremely fucking articulate when he wants to e ?
BUDDY: I do n't know who 's selling who what anymore .
FRANK: It 's not clear , is it ?
BUDDY: Not only that but something feels eally wrong .
FRANK: Hold on . I told you that you were working on commission..
BUDDY: Yeah , but..
FRANK: So whatever our end of this is , you get a piece .
BUDDY: A piece ?
FRANK: Half . It could help set you up , Buddy . So whatever feels wrong is gon na feel right pretty damn quick , okay ? We just have to close it out . From here on , watch me , do what I do , and we 'll be fine .
BUDDY: But..
FRANK: He wants you to go with him to take this money somewhere which means that it 's you he trusts . And that 's fine because I trust you too . Just do n't trust him , okay ?
BUDDY: I 'm lost again .
FRANK: Look , that funny feeling you have.. I have it too . And it 's not funny . So go along , be friendly , but that 's it .
BEAT: There 's a euphoria that comes with closing a deal , Buddy , and the igger the deal , the higher you get . It 's better than anything .
BUDDY: All right .
FRANK: Now go . You know.. I always wondered why you wanted to work here . I thought you could do a lot better . I did n't know about your folks , I 'm eally sorry .
BUDDY: Thank you . He goes on .
KATHRYN: Is that right ?
BUDDY: Feeling a little weepy .
KATHRYN: You boys..
BUDDY: I can maybe do something really good for us , Katy .
KATHRYN: You already have .
BUDDY: I mean , money wise .
KATHRYN: About Mr. Bush ?
BUDDY: Yeah . I 'm getting half of whateve we make off of him .
KATHRYN: So why are n't you happy about it ?
BUDDY: Did n't know I was n't . I was happy for a minute . And then the whole thing of making a carnival out of a person 's death , I do n't know if it 's right .
KATHRYN: Is it what he wants ?
BUDDY: He says it is .
KATHRYN: You are not responsible for what other people do , Buddy , just you .
BUDDY: You 're right . You 're always right .
KATHRYN: At least I am when I 'm half naked .
BUDDY: Right .
BUSH: North .
BUDDY: How far ?
BUSH: Till I say , son .
BUDDY: How much further now ?
FRANK: Hey Mattie .
MATTIE: This is a surprise .
FRANK: Yeah , sorry .
MATTIE: Was there something you.. ?
FRANK: Uh , yeah.. Help !
MATTIE: What ?
FRANK: I 'm up to my ears with this funeral and I thought , you know , we have n't had time to talk much lately so maybe you 'd like to come over and ip open envelopes with me and
MATTIE: I 'm sorry , I have lessons all afternoon . I have to get back in .
FRANK: Oh , okay , I just..
MATTIE: Sorry .
BUSH: Do n't say nothing .
BUDDY: To who ?
BUSH: You can say `` hi '' .
BUDDY: Hi .
CHARLIE: Hello .
BUDDY: Hi . Charlie holds out his hand , Buddy shakes it .
CHARLIE: Are you sure you 're in the right place ? Not expecting a funeral .
BUSH: Hey , Charlie .
CHARLIE: Yes .
BUDDY: Hi !
BUSH: That 's Buddy Robinson , he do n't talk much .
CHARLIE: Someone better talk . A ghost pulls up in the driveway in a hearse , you expect a little bit of a story .
BUSH: Yes , sir .
CHARLIE: You know I 've talked to God a lot about you over the years and he said he broke the mould when he made you . Said you were sure entertaining to watch but way too much trouble . Buddy grins .
BUSH: Well .
CHARLIE: What would you want me to say at this funeral ?
BUSH: Whatever you want to , Charlie .
TO BUDDY: Could you give us a minute ? Buddy starts to get up .
BUSH: Sit still . Buddy plops back down .
CHARLIE: What 's the matter ? You scared to be alone with me ?
BUSH: He can hear what 's said . Buddy is surprised again . So is Charlie .
CHARLIE: All right . After you left here.. did you do the right thing ?
BUSH: I did.. what I thought was right .
CHARLIE: You confessed ? Asked forgiveness ?
BUSH: You self-righteous..
CHARLIE: Do n't you dare..
BUSH: I built my own jail and put myself in it ! And I stayed in it for 40 goddamn years ! No wife , no kids , no friends ! That 's not enough ?
CHARLIE: You know it is n't .
BUSH: Well . Why do n't you come and say that then , Charlie ? Hell , say it all ! I do n't care .
CHARLIE: Not on your life .
BUDDY: Almost nothing , sir . I just work at the funeral home .
CHARLIE: Do you know he built this church ?
BUDDY: No ? !
LOOKING AROUND: How 's a man like him make something like this ? I mean , I know he 's a good carpenter but this is..
CHARLIE: Magic ? Maybe it 's the best of him , maybe he put his soul into it , I do n't know .
BUDDY: What ya 'll were talking about.. what did he do ? Who was he supposed to tell ?
THINKS: For him and God to know I guess . I wish I 'd never been put between them , that 's for sure .
BEAT: I will tell you that he showed up here half dead . I had just started preaching . Over the next 4 years we uilt this .
BUDDY: Are you coming to the funeral ? Charlie sighs and looks around . 94A Omitted 94A
BUSH: Do you have to ?
BUDDY: Yes . What are we doing ? Since the day you came into the funeral home , I do n't think anything has happened that you did n't want to happen . I just do n't know where it 's going .
BUSH: There 's a whole lot of things that you do n't know . Like what a dog dreams . You can make up a story about him chasing rabbits but you do n't know if there 's rabbits in there or not . And he ca n't tell you , can he ?
BUDDY: Not unless he 's a very special dog . They snort together .
BUSH: People do n't say what they mean either so you do n't really know any more about them then you do about that dog 's dream .
BUDDY: But what.. ?
LOOKING AWAY: That time you left my house I saw you stop and look back . You wanted to know what could make somebody like me . Well here you are , son , here you are .
MUTTERS: Where are you.. ?
BUDDY: I better stop and tell Frank we 're ack . He 's probably had 2 or 3 hissy fits by now . Why do n't you stay the night at the house and I 'll take you home in the morning ?
BUSH: Well , I I ai n't stayed with nobody in a.. in a long while .
BUDDY: It 's fine if you want to .
BUSH: Let me out .
BUDDY: What ?
BUSH: Stop the car .
BUDDY: You ca n't walk . It 's too far.. Bush climbs out with his shotgun .
BUSH: Put the money in a casket .
BUDDY: You might as well get back in , I 'll follow you all the way .
BUSH: Get the hell out of here , boy !
BUDDY: Not responsible . Not responsible . Shit . He slams the steering wheel .
BUSH: They keep talking about forgiveness.. ask Jesus fo forgiveness.. I never did nothing to Him..
FRANK: The cut 's not bad but how 's the head ? He moves his finger across Buddy 's eyes .
BUDDY: No . I was putting the money in.. heard glass breaking.. locked up the casket quick and.. boom..
FRANK: You did good .
BUDDY: Does n't feel good .
BUSH: Please , Ma'am .
MATTIE: What are you doing here ?
BUSH: Can I sit a minute ?
MATTIE: I 'm not stupid , Felix . No , I take that back . How long was it going on ? She was already married when I met you . Were you just making up to me to get to her ? Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle .
BUSH: Can you help who you love ?
MATTIE: I do n't know either , so..
BUSH: I want to tell you how it was . If you do n't want me to , I 'll go .
MATTIE: Do n't lie to me . When did you take up with her ?
BUSH: I came to see you and she was there , hanging clothes on the line with your mama .
BEAT: And then I saw her .
MATTIE: She was married ! And she was n't just my sister , she was my best friend . We told each othe everything . I can't.. how long did it go on ? !
BUSH: It 's still going on , Little Bit .
MATTIE: Did you have anything to do with her death ? The mug trembles . She sees it .
BUSH: Been there .
MATTIE: You need to see a doctor..
FRANK: What the hell ? !
BUSH: They get it ?
FRANK: No . Buddy sealed it up in a casket . Took a crack on the head , but..
BUSH: Is he all right ?
FRANK: Yeah .
BUSH: You sure ?
FRANK: I was an army medic . He 'll be fine . But Bush is still dark .
BUSH: They get the whiskey ?
FRANK: Brought the money back , huh ? Listen , I 've been thinking.. What if we had the party at your place ? People are going to want to see the land they 're getting so..
BUSH: Do n't know .
FRANK: Well , think about it , we could..
BUSH: Do n't know that I 'm doing it .
FRANK: What ? !
BUSH: Thinking to call it off .
FRANK: You ca n't !
BUSH: Damn well can if I want to .
FRANK: No no no , it 's in motion !
BUSH: If I say no , it 's no . Send the money back .
FRANK: You 're killing me ! I bought things , hired people.. promised money , everybody in town is hoping to..
BUSH: I care about this town as much as they care about me .
FRANK: It 's what you said you wanted and I 've busted my ass for you . So why do n't you want it anymore ? You owe me that .
LONG BEAT: It was the end of the line , tell it all , get out of jail party . But I guess I ai n't got the goddamn guts to open my own mouth and I ca n't get nobody to talk for me so the hell with it . And to hell with me .
KATHRYN: Are you having trouble seeing ?
BUDDY: I see you 're mad .
KATHRYN: I 'm not mad . I 'm concerned
KATHRYN: If I could get my hands on whoeve did this , you 'd see mad .
FRANK: Trouble .
BUDDY: What 's the matter ?
FRANK: Bush is pulling out .
BUDDY: What ?
FRANK: What happened yesterday ?
BUDDY: I told you , we went up to Illinois and met a preacher .
FRANK: But what happened ?
BUDDY: He asked the preacher to come to the funeral . He said no .
FRANK: Son of a bitch , that 's got to be..
TO KATHRYN: Sorry . Sorry . Where 's the preacher ?
BUDDY: It wo n't do you any good .
FRANK: Why not ?
BUDDY: He knows something about Bush , something bad , I think .
FRANK: What is it ?
BUDDY: Would n't say but..
FRANK: Well if Bush wants him , by God , Bush is gon na get him .
KATHRYN: You want eggs , Frank , or will the skillet do ?
FRANK: What ? What 's wrong ?
KATHRYN: What 's wrong ? My husband has his head bashed in and all you care about is this party !
FRANK: It 's not like that , Katie , this is for all of us . You 're like.. family to me.. I..
KATHRYN: This is not how family acts !
FRANK: Well , I 'm sorry . I 've never had any practice . You okay ?
BUDDY: Stay out of her way today , partner .
MATTIE: Fool , it 's too late for bulbs..
FRANK: Reverend Jackson ? Frank Quinn , Quinn funeral home .
CHARLIE: How 'd you find me ?
FRANK: Bush ? No , sir .
CHARLIE: You sure ?
FRANK: Pretty sure .
CHARLIE: Did you check the back ? Frank snorts , liking Charlie immediately .
FRANK: You told Bush that you would n't come to the funeral ?
CHARLIE: If he got that , why are you here ?
FRANK: To help you rethink it .
CHARLIE: I do n't need any help .
FRANK: Have you rethought it ? So there is a need .
BEAT: First off , Bush does n't know I 'm here .
CHARLIE: I would n't be so sure about that . He 's got a way of making people do what he wants them to . Frank squirms , knows it true .
FRANK: He came to see me after he 'd been here , wants to call the party off .
CHARLIE: I do n't care .
FRANK: Said he 'd meant it to be a.. end of the line , tell it all , get out of jail funeral but that he did n't have the guts to open his mouth and he could n't get anybody to talk fo him . You know anything about that part ? At first he said he wanted everybody to come who had a story about him . But he did n't want to hear their bullshit stories , did he ? Pardon my language . He wants to tell one , does n't he ?
CHARLIE: About time .
FRANKFRANK: Whatever he did , it 's been locked up in him for 40 years and he ca n't get it out . I think he told you . You may be the only person he told . And now he wants you to tell it for him .
CHARLIE: Because he wo n't .
FRANK: Or ca n't .
CHARLIE: Or wo n't .
FRANK: Or ca n't .
BEAT: At least he wants the truth to come out , give him that .
LONG STARE: I 'll think about it .
FRANK: Is there a boarding house around here ?
CHARLIE: I said I 'd think .
FRANK: Yeah but if you 're not coming , I 'm not going back . I made promises I ca n't keep to people I care about . This falls apart they wo n't blame Bush . Bank will take my business.. If I 'm gon na have to start ove again , might as well be from here . Charlie scowls at him .
BUDDY: What are you doing , sir ?
BUSH: Getting a suntan .
BUDDY: Are you stuck ?
BUSH: You have no goddamn idea how right you are , son .
BUDDY: Are you sick ?
BUSH: Just going through the motions .
BUDDY: What does that mean ?
BUSH: There 's Alive and there 's Dead . And there 's a worst place in etween them that I hope you neve know nothing about .
DARKENING: Do you know who hurt you ?
BUDDY: No , sir .
BUSH: Sonsabitches .
BUDDY: It does n't matter . Listen . Frank went somewhere and the raffle money is gone .
BUSH: You figure he took off with it ?
BUDDY: I do n't know . I do n't want to think that . But the money 's not here and I do n't know where it is . He said he 'd call and he never did .
BUSH: Well.. what do you want to do ? Buddy looks back at Bush .
BUDDY: I don't.. I want to make this funeral for you if you want it .
BUSH: Hell . Do it if you can .
BEAT: I guess for everyone like me , there 's one like you , son . I about forgot that .
BUDDY: I 'm glad you decided to come , sir .
CHARLIE: Free will is not all that it 's cracked up to be .
AT FRANK: Did you take the money out of the casket ?
FRANK: Yeah .
BUDDY: Why did n't you tell me ? !
FRANK: I forgot .
BUDDY: You forgot ? ! Where is it ?
FRANK: In the hearse , under the floorboards .
BUDDY: I forgot to tell you , Mr. Bush already said he would do it .
FRANK: You 're shittin ' me ? ! Charlie gets up and starts walking away..
CHARLIE: Where can I catch a train ?
FRANK: You ca n't leave you just got here .
CHARLIE: Watch and learn .
FRANK: Hold on..
CHARLIE: Where 's the station ?
FRANK: Honestly ? We do n't have a clue about what 's going to happen here .
CHARLIE: Pretty nice jail .
BUSH: Why did you change your mind ?
CHARLIE: How do you want to do this ?
BUSH: I do n't .
GARY: Hey , hey , where you going ? He said the woods..
CARL: Closer .
THEMAN: He 's crazy !
FRANK: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen . I 'm Frank Quinn of Quinn Funeral Home . Welcome to the live funeral party of Mr. Felix Bush !
BUDDY: Where 's Mattie ?
KATHRYN: She would n't come . I don't..
FRANK: I 've done some things in my life , ut never this . Bet you have n't either , bet no one has .
FRANK: The person who made all of this happen for us does n't like the spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the heart of Quinn Funeral Home and I 'm proud to know him .
BUSH: Sonsabitches .
CARL: Do n't do it ! Gary drops the pistol .
BUSH: Now pick up them cans and keep pouring .
CARL: What ?
BUSH: You heard me . The men cautiously pick up the cans..
THEMAN: I wo n't !
BUSH: Pour it or die , I do n't care which .
FRANK: I know many of you have heard stories about Mr. Bush . But today I 've been told that we 're going to hear another kind of story , his .
QUINN: Holy Mother of.. SHERIFF DEPUTIES beside the stage see Bush .
CARL: Do n't hurt him ! It 's my fault .
BUSH: A second chance is a precious thing , son . Do n't waste it . The boy plops down , overwhelmed . And suddenly everyone is in motion .
BUDDY: Are you alright , sir ? ! Without turning Bush glances at the Deputies .
BUSH: Tried to burn me out . Let the boy e , he did n't mean nothing .
CARL: Help him , Gus , please..
ANNOUNCER: Folks , I 've just received word of a tragic turn of events at the Bush Funeral Party . It seems that Mr. Bush has been shot . I repeat , Mr. Felix Bush has been shot . There is no word of condition..
BUSH: Close the door .
FRANK: Missed the bone . Got any alcohol and clean rags ?
BUDDY: Why do n't you sit down , sir ?
BUSH: Boil some water and I 'll tell you how to make me a poultice . Frank takes the rags and alcohol from Charlie
FRANK: This is gon na hurt .
BUSH: Do n't sugar coat it .
REVEREND HORTON: Lord , you say you move in mysterious ways and we believe you ecause we do n't understand much of anything . And so we come to you today not seeking answers to what 's happened here but asking you to help us open our hearts a little more to each other and find some forgiveness and understanding .
BUS H: Pretty good prayer . Mighta been wrong about that preacher .
CHARLIE: Why do n't you lay down , Felix ?
BUSH: Let 's go 'fore I lose my nerve .
BUDDY: Are you sure ?
BUSH: You ai n't nervous ? All them white folks out there ?
CHARLIE: There 's white folks here ? !
BUSH: Stick with me , you 'll be all right .
CHARLIE: You 're the one they 're shooting at .
BUSH: Pretty interesting day so far , huh oy ?
CHARLIE: I 'm Reverend Charlie Jackson . Felix wants to continue with his funeral . And he 's asked me to say a few words .
TIGHTLY: .all tangled up with each other .
CHARLIE: Some 40 years ago Felix Bush dropped into my life and then dropped out . In between he built the most beautiful sanctuary that I 've ever seen . A lot of wonderful things happened in that church .
BUSH: Thank you , Charlie . Thank you .
BEAT: Because.. because I did something that I was ashamed of . Something I could n't ever fix .
GLANCES AROUND: Ya 'll probably think you know what you 'd do or what you would n't . And I wish you good luck with that . I eally do .
BEAT: When I told Charlie what I 'd done , he told me to confess to God and the law and to.. to someone else.. so I could get forgiveness . But I did n't want forgiveness .
BUSH: I fell in love with a married lady . And somehow she fell in love with me . It was the only time that I have been in love .
GATHERS HIMSELF: We made a plan to run off and start a new life but she did n't show up at the time that we said we 'd meet . I got a funny feeling and I went to her house .
BUSH: Her husband answered the door .
BEAT: He had blood on him .
BUSH: I hit him pretty hard , knocked him down . Ca n't remember going upstairs ut I remember I saw a hammer on the steps and it had blood and hai on it . The crowd gasps . Mattie is trembling .
BEAT: But before I could get to her and help her up.. a kerosene lamp hit the wall . And then her husband jumped on my back . Funny what happens sometimes when things go wrong . It 's like the clock stops and you have all the time in the world to think . I could see that her husband had set the downstairs on fire before he came up .
BEAT: And as I was thinking about that , I saw that the lamp he threw had set the room we were in on fire too .
BUSH: And then I realized that I was on fire . I tried to put myself out but I could n't , everything was..
BEAT: I dropped him , turned around and saw her lying on the floor and called her name . She looked up at me..
BUSH: I do n't know how I got out the window .
BEAT: I did n't get her out , Little Bit , I did n't . I 'm sorry .
MATTIE: Oh , Felix.. He sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it .
BUSH: Wonder if her hair would be white ?
BUDDY: How you doing , sir ?
BUSH: Just fair , son .
HORTON: Carl said Ray paid them to set the fire . Paid them to break into the funeral home too .
FRANK: Ca n't stop pulling Aces out of his ass , can he ?
HORTON: Spend his money on lawyers now . You know how thrifty they are .
BUSH: What 's his name ?
BUDDY: Larry , Lawrence , after my dad , sir .
BUSH: He ai n't gon na throw rocks at me , is he ?
BUDDY: Not if knows what 's good for him .
BUSH: You boys did good . Real good . Let 's settle up .
BUDDY: We do n't have to do that now . You get some rest .
FRANK: Yeah . We 'll come out tomorrow .
BUSH: Bring my shirt back , I just got it oke in .
FRANK: Are you alright , Mattie ?
MATTIE: Oh , I do n't know . I 'm still moving , I guess..
BUSH: Thanks again for coming , Charlie .
CHARLIE: I 'm proud of you .
MEANING IT: Thank you for my church .
BUSH: Did you ever get my bill ?
HORTON: Can we get a ride our car 's about 2 miles down the road .
TO HIMSELF: Look at that . My funeral and everybody 's in there but me .
CHARLIE: Well , Felix , this one 's for real , I guess . I did n't actually see them put you in the box so..
BUDDY: A 50 on the outside , all ones inside . Less than $ 100 .
FRANK: What ? !
CHARLIE: I told you . Nobody listens to the preacher . Buddy pulls some papers from his coat .
BUDDY: The day of the party he told me about the will he had in the secret drawer of his table . He left the affle money to all of us . Everyone is shocked , touched .
TO FRANK: But you have to pay for Mule 's upkeep for the rest of his life .
BUDDY: And he set up a fund for the upkeep of your church .
CHARLIE: What 's the catch ?
BUDDY: No catch , sir .
CHARLIE: Still do n't get it , do you ? With Felix , there 's always a catch .
BUDDY: Maybe he just knew you 'd go crazy wondering what it was .
SEMINAR PRESENTER: Which brings us on to Dental Insurance . Generally speaking , when you receive care from a participating PDP dentist , your out- of-pocket expenses will typically e lower than if your were to accept care from a dentist outside the group . The law deems it illegal for dentists to charge any more than the network approves But listen , in my three and a half years of experience in this usiness people mainly care about keeping their premiums low . So , each of you must be prepared to sell the network to your clients and always cater to their specific condition .
JAMES: Where 's everybody ?
MAVIS: Mr. Brown . You scared me !
JAMES: Mavis . Where 's everybody at ? I got a meetin ' this mornin ' .
MAVIS: It 's Sunday , Mr. Brown .
JAMES: No , it 's Tuesday , Mavis .
SEMINAR PRESENTER: Now , understand that not all people have the same type of needs . When it comes to an insurance plan everyone is different .
JAMES: OK Stop . Sir . Stop . Who been in there ?
SEMINAR PRESENTER: Excuse me ?
JAMES: I own this building , someone has een in there used my commode . Now who was it ?
SEMINAR PRESENTER: Sorry . We 're actually renting this part of the building today , and we 're in the middle of a seminar .
JAMES: I do n't care if you 're in the middle of a heart attack son . Someone been in there , I hear the chain flush , I can smell it . Now who it was ?
INSURANCE SALESMAN: It is . It 's fuckin ' him . BACK AT THE FRONT someone sniggers .
JAMES: Something funny ?
INSURANCE SALESMAN: No , sir .
JAMES: Then why you cats laughing ?
INSURANCE SALESMAN: I was n't laughing . It was n't me .
SEMINAR PRESENTER: Look , I suggest we just continue OK . So . How does the program work ? Initially , participating dentists undergo an extensive credentialing process which , if approved , allows customers to pay the minimum deductible allowed and the emainder is insured . But with non- participating dentists the cost pe visit is much higher and comes completely out of pocket . So some people may want a high deductible ecause they have more to cover , ut most common folks simply want the lowest possible plan and emember our key takeaway ! ? Entire seminar in UNISON .
JAMES: OK listen up people . The room goes still and completely silent .
INSURANCE SALESMAN: Do n't shoot .
JAMES: I ai n't gone shoot nobody , son .
FEMALE SALESWOMAN: Yes sir , Mister Brown .
JAMES: Yes you did . Now , do n't cry . It 's gone be okay .

RALPH: James , this is a ballad . The pace we 've set is perfect .
JAMES: I know it 's a ballad , Mr. Bass . But a ballad is supposed to get he in the mood , not put her to sleep .
BOBBY: Let 's just get it done OK ?
JAMES: But it ai n't right .
SYD NATHAN: What the hell is this Ralph ? ! Where 's the rest of the song ?
RALPH BASS: Syd-
SYD NATHAN: He just keeps hollering that one word over and over . `` Please '' . `` Please '' what , Ralph ? ! Please jerk my dick ? What the hell does he want ? If he does n't tell me , you 're fired .
RALPH: Listen , Mr. Nathan . This song-
SYD NATHAN: I do n't hear a song Ralph . A song has verses . A snappy chorus . It 's not just some unfortunate nigge pleading . Who needs that ? Give me the fucking song Ralph . The song .

BOBBY: I do n't understand . Is this some sort of mistake ?
NAFLOYD: His Famous Flames ?
BABY ROY: Sir , this ai n't right .
BEN BART: We agree . See I believe it should say simply James Brown . The fact is Gentlemen , James Brown does n't need the Famous Flames . King records and Universal do n't need the Famous Flames . But James has requested that the name remain in some form . Now if you want to stay , stay , but from now on you work for James Brown , on James Brown 's records . Should you find this disagreeable in part or whole , you can go home .
NAFLOYD: James ?
JAMES: Bobby . It 's just a name . Ai n't nothing different between us . This for all us not just me . It 's gone e good . Bobby stares back . Nafloyd steps up to James .
NAFLOYD: James Brown . I never liked you . Come on . Let 's get outta here..
BART: So . Do you know what you want James ?
YOUNG JAMES: I know exactly what I want .
SYD NATHAN: Forget it . King does n't make live albums . They 're too expensive .
JAMES: I think a live album-
SYD NATHAN: James , your audience is Negro . Negroes do n't buy albums . They do n't have the resources . Especially not for a bunch a songs they already got . James turns to Ben Bart .
BEN BART: James , Recording live is five , six times as expensive as the studio . And that 's for some violin concerto at the Met . No one jumps up and shouts `` Blow it fucker ! '' in the middle of The Magic Flute .
JAMES: But , Pop , you know my show . James turns to Syd .
SYD: Do n't need to .
JAMES: Mr. Nathan-
SYD: The `` Mashed Potato '' .
JAMES: That ai n't the `` Mashed Potato '' .
SYD: Exactly .
SYD NATHAN: So I stick to what I know . You stick to what you know . And that 's the showbusiness .
JAMES: Book the Apollo . I 'm gon na spend my own money on this . Syd Nathan 's wrong .
BEN BART: I 'm not going to let you do that , Jimmy .
JAMES: Book it out next week for the whole week , go in , we drill it , we drill it , we drill it , then we drop it .
BEN BART: Forget it , Jimmy . It 's too big of a isk . Let 's order something to eat .
JAMES: I do n't understand risk ? James stiffens .
BEN BART: Of course not , Jimmy .
JAMES: Sure it is . That 's all me and my lack brothers are to the `` White Devil '' . We the show and you the money . And that 's how the White Devil keeps it all .
BEN BART: I 'm not the `` White Devil '' . I 'm trying to protect you . I 'm doing my job . James becomes intense . A waitress walks over .
JAMES: Pop , look me in the eye . Ben stays on his menu .
BEN BART: I 'll call Nola Sound . They got these new three track stereo ecorders from Ampex .
JAMES: And I want the best engineer in town . I do n't care what it takes . I do n't care what it cost . I want everyone in uniform , the ushers , front of house , the peanut peddlers .
BEN BART: We 'll need the band in New York immediately .
JAMES: And I want ` em in Sapphire blue suits . Pop . Sapphire .
BEN BART: Sapphire Blue . Underwear too . How does that sound ? Pop smiles as does James .
JAMES: It 's cold . It 's cold . It 's too cold man . It 's too cold . Cold . Cold . They round the corner .
GERTRUDE: Evening , Mr. Brown . Cold out tonight .
JAMES: Gertrude . See if you can get some coffee for the folks in line .
BOBBY BYRD: Ready Mr. Brown .
SYD: We got the level on his main mic way up to drown out the crowd . You got ta get him to hold back a little in the first number !
BEN BART: I think its too late for that . You ai n't got a breeze , Syd . You got a hurricane .
JAMES: Watch me .
BOBBY: Gertrude . Get everybody out .
GERTRUDE: What ?
JAMES: We gone celebrate tonight . And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again .

AUNT HONEY: Do n't cry , Little Junior . Do n't cry . Now , child , I want you to listen to me . You gone be okay . You hear me ? Little Junior , you were orn dead . Did you know that ? James shakes his head .
MACEO: Who 's this ?

MACEO: Which seat . Her 's or the bus ?
YVONNE: I 'm Yvonne ! I 'm a singer . Let me worry about my seat . Bennet and Maceo snicker .
BART: Compliments of Universal Attractions .
JAMES: This for me ? Looky this ! We got us a chauffeur .
BART: What 's that Jimmy .
JAMES: I got a seventh grade education Pop , so you 'll have to excuse me . I was looking over those figures you sent me , and something occur to me we do n't pay the promoter , the promoter pay us .
BART: Just standard Jimmy . Guarantee against fluctuating ticket sales . Lets plan a-
JAMES: -sure we planning , see I ask myself , what if we do n't got fluctuating sales . What if you knocking the tar out of every show .
BART: Well let me explain the way it works . When you book a show . Take Chicago . Now our promoter in Chicago is-
JAMES: I do n't doubt it .
BART: Now when Lenny pays us a flat rate , we can account . You know , numbe one , you 're getting top rate and number two-
JAMES: What if we took the gate ? What if we took it ourself .
BEN BART: Better than Lenny Franks ?
JAMES: Lenny Franks a James Brown fan ? How old he , sixty ? Why 's he gone try harder for James Brown than for Sam Cooke ? Or Ray Charles . Or Tom Jones . See Pop . We go to the radio stations .
BART: Jimmy , I understand you frustration but you got ta realize you 're entering a game where the ules are set out . If you were a all player you ca n't walk in and change how many innings they 're gon na play just because
JAMES: You see my point right ? OK . Listen up . We go to the radio station . We go to the young cats . The hungry cats . The late night cat .
BART: Its beautiful Jimmy . I ca n't do it . Bart picks up a piece of fish and eats it .
JAMES: Why not ?
BART: Universal Attractions promotes many acts . I ca n't piss off the 60 or 70 promoters in this country to skim a little extra on the James Brown Show .
JAMES: It 's not a little . If the show sells , and it 's sellin ' , we talking thousands of dollars a night . Difference per year between 2 and 3 million dollars .
BART: And I 'm out of a job . Think you 're forgetting I do n't just work fo James Brown .
JAMES: And there 's my next point Pop . Why not ?
BEN BART: I thank you for the fish . And I 'm gon na need some benefits , boss . Bart crosses to the limo and leaves .
BART: Po-lice have the same problem .
JAMES: Who you play Sax with son ?
DEDE: I was home all day .
JAMES: You were home all day . So why you did n't pick up the phone ?

ROSE: Come on . I mean , it 's kind of obvious .
ROD: What ?
ROSE: That there 's something between us .
ROD: No . I 'm calling about Chris .
ROSE: We 'd all go out drinking I emember you looking at me .
ROD: That 's my best friend . If you did
ROSE: I know you think about fucking me , Rod .
ROD: No . You crazy No .
CHRIS: Winter , Spring , Summer and Fall , all you need to do is call . And I 'll be there . You got a friend . Ai n't it good to know you 've got a friend . Ai n't it good to know you 've got a friend . Oh , yeah , yeah , you 've got a friend .
JIM: Hello Chris . How 's it going ? You can answer . There 's an intercom in the room ; I can hea you .
CHRIS: I need water .
JIM: Yeah , sorry about that . If it makes you feel any better , I 'm thirsty too .
CHRIS: I need to get outta here .
JIM: Right . So , the reason I am talking to you now is so you can understand what is happening to you . I guess your ` understanding ' it raises the success rate of this whole thing . Not even sure I ` understand ' it .
CHRIS: Where 's Rose ?
JIM: Hot is n't she ? Hot voice anyway , you dirty dog . You 're one of the lucky one 's . The son Jeremy 's wrangling method sounds way less pleasant .
CHRIS: Is this some kind of a game to you ?
JIM: They asked me for my favorite song , which was hard ; I like all types of music . Turns out they eally just needed one I knew all the words to I went with James Taylor 's `` You Got a Friend . '' I hope it has n't been too torturous ; that was n't the point . The point is that you learn it , and for us to have that knowledge in common .
CHRIS: Who the fuck are you people ?
JIM: Oh right . Okay , let me back up and give you the cliff notes . The Armitages and I are a part of a society . A pretty extraordinary society actually .
CHRIS: You hypnotize me ? Break my will.. ? Make me a slave like the others ? This is some crazy racist shit .
JIM: No . Not racist , Chris . We do n't hate you . We want to be you You are not going to be a slave . You 're going to be a vessel .
CHRIS: Wait , what ?
JIM: Missy 's hypnosis was merely to sedate you . Oh , that and to prepare you psychologically
CHRIS: For what ? Jim smiles .
JIM: For the procedure .
CHRIS: What 's the procedure ?
JIM: Are you ready ? Drum roll please . Brain transplantation . Some say it could never be done ;
CHRIS: What the fuck ?
JIM: Dean 's the only guy who really gets the science . He 's the one who discovered that full brain transplantation is n't actually necessary to transfer the soul , and that partial brain transplantation solves the little nerve ending problem .
CHRIS: No .
JIM: Okay so You see the blue part ? That 's the piece of your brain that 's all rooted in the nervous system . So that stays ; keeping those tricky little connections intact . The rest is discarded . Then they 'll remove the red part of my brain from my skull and put in yours . Your `` blue '' and my `` red '' asically absorb each other . And apparently the brain heals surprisingly fast , so assuming everything goes as planned , we should be up and functioning in a couple weeks .
CHRIS: And my brain ?
JIM: Your red part ? It 'll be discarded , ut do n't worry . You wont be gone . Well not completely . You 'll still e in there somewhere ; limited consciousness of course ;
DEFEATED: The Sunken Place .
JIM: Yes . That 's what she calls it . Good ! So you understand , I 'll control the motor functions , the will of our body , effectively
CHRIS: Me You will be me .
JIM: As far as the world is concerned . It 's still a pretty new operation . Some kinks . We 're supposed to stay away from flashes of light fo example . They can trigger a `` momentary lapse in control of motor functions ''
CHRIS: Why black people ? Jim is disappointed in the question .
JIM: Well , because you get the highest ids . For the last decade or so anyway . I wish it was less simple than that , but it 's not . You 're in fashion , baby ! Final hope sinks from . Chris shoulders .
CHRIS: That 's crazy .
JIM: Take it as a compliment .
CHRIS: You 're not going to get away with this .
JIM: We have and we will . We 'll be together soon , brother .
CHRIS: No , No
INAUDIBLE: Wait . Wait . Chris ! . Chri- Chris chokes her . Tears stream down his face .
CHRIS: Shhhh .
DEAN: Saw Jeremy hands Dean a circular surgical saw .
TUTORIAL: I seem to have misplaced my passport . Je crois avoi egare mon passeport .
911 OPERATOR: 911 emergency , I 'm at the home of Dean and Missy Armitage
CHRIS: Ahhhh !
TUTORIAL: Can you direct me to the nearest hospital ? Pouvez-vous me dirige vers I'hopital le plus proche ?
TO HIMSELF: No no Do n't do it Just get the fuck got ta here Just go ! Just Fuck !
TUTORIAL: Where is the nearest train station ? Ou est la gare la plus proche ?
GEORGINA: Ahhhhh ! !

THROUGH TEARS: Grandma ! ! ! !

JEREMY: Kill him , Grandpa .
GRANDPA: The gun , Jeremy .

DOC: Yeah .
CAROL: Where do you want to go ?
DOC: I want to take a walk .
DOC: It does n't look like that .
CAROL: What do you mean ? You 've never been there .
DOC: I 've been there every day for the last four years .
CAROL: Small town , small bank , big money .

CAROL: Want to cry now ?
DOC: You got ta be kidding .
BEYNON: Not at all , just a pleasant way to have lunch . Doc sits .
DOC: All it takes is a long arm .
BEYNON: Hard to judge how these things happen . The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions .
DOC: I guess it was because I was a model prisoner .
BEYNON: This is the only time you and I meet in public . Any business with me , handle it with him
DOC: I get my own help .
BEYNON: You run the job , but I run the show . You got two weeks to set it up .

CAROL: I 'd like an application for a checking account . She gets it , moves to
DOC: Could I get change for this fifty please ? His eyes alert and probing .
CAROL: Usually on the right side as you go in .
DOC: Nail him first , be careful he does n't panic and want to shoot somebody . Local police have one car , a rover , should n't e in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it 's answering an emergency call if the cop car shows up remembe it does n't have any automatic weapons . Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard . Get into a tight spot , you 'll be out of ange at forty yards . Then they 're down to their side guns .

RUDY: Are n't we going a little hard ?
DOC: What do you have in mind ?
RUDY: It 's just a walk-in bank . You do n't have to be Dillinger for this one .
DOC: Dillinger got killed .
ACCOUNTANT: I understand .
DOC: Beynon has to be alone at the drop one car at the ranch and that 's it . I wo n't have the money she wo n't know where it is until I 'm sure it 's clear .
ACCOUNTANT: He understands .
DOC: Make sure everybody does .
CAROL: You know how I feel ?
DOC: My mind 's not on guessing games . Carol turns away from the mirror .
CAROL: Promise you wo n't laugh .
DOC: If it 's funny I 'm going to laugh .
CAROL: I feel like the night before the first day of school .
DOC: That bad ? Carol laughs .
CAROL: It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more .
DOC: Waiting 's hard . You never learn how .
CAROL: You know I 've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes worn out waiting .
DOC: At least you were outside .
CAROL: It doesn ! t make much difference where you are , if you 're waiting , Doc .

RUDY: He did n't make it , Doc you did n't either .
CAROL: How did you know ?
DOC: Jackson panicked and nailed the guard .
CAROL: Oh , Christ . Doc leans forward. , snaps on the radio .

CAROL: There are three men dead .

CAROL: He might be ready to chop us up .
DOC: Do it my way .
CAROL: I 've never `` been there When we met it was in his office . Doc looks at her for a moment .
DOC: I just figure the percentages . He would n't try a cross until he 's got the money .
CAROL: Let 's send his cut back Just keep going .

BEYNON: Here . I understand the way you feel . As a matter of fact , you and I might share a great many feelings
DOC: I 'm in a hurry .
BEYNON: You still do n't get the picture do you ? I 've always heard what a smart ass operator you are .
DOC: No applause !
BEYNON: Let 's examine the situation . One , an extremely attractive woman . Then , there 's the woman 's husband , a skillful bank obber serving a long sentence in prison . Three , a man with political influence , a man who can easily get a parole for a convict why should he ?
DOC: I knew that life did n't add up to the obvious when I was 8 .
BEYNON: What do you add up to here ?
DOC: One . The radio 's rappin ' about $ 750^000 . We only got a half a million .
BEYNON: A little more was taken out before . My brother 's a director of that Bank , Mr. McCoy I had a few pressing debts .
DOC: So we did that crackerbox to cover fo you .
BEYNON: The obvious . But we are both not interested in that ight now .

MOLLY: No . He would never say that .
SAM: Ditto . Tell her `` ditto '' .
ODA MAE: Ditto ? What 's that mean , ditto ?
MOLLY: Sam ?
ODA MAE: To tell the truth , I do n't know how I 'm doin ' it . In fack , confidentially , nothin ' like this never happened to me before . Now , all a sudden , I ca n't turn it off . Is this you ? Is this him ? They both say `` yes '' at the same time .
MOLLY: I do n't understand . Why did he come ack ? Why is he still here ?
ODA MAE: Cause he 's stuck , that 's why . He 's etween worlds . It happens sometimes , when their spirits get out too quick . He thinks he still has stuff t'do down here .
SAM: Come on Oda Mae , stop rambling .
ODA MAE: Oh , oh , now he 's got an attitude . Molly stares at Oda Mae .
SAM: I do not have an attitude .
ODA MAE: We 're having a discussion . Whataya mean , you 're not angry ? If you were n't angry you would n't be aisin ' your voice like that .
SAM: Goddamn it , Oda Mae !
ODA MAE: Ah ah , baby . That does it . I do n't talk to anybody who takes the Lord 's name in vain .
SAM: Relax , Oda Mae .
ODA MAE: You relax . You 're the dead one . You want my help , then you apologize . Nobody talks to me like that , understand ?
SAM: Jesus Christ !
ODA MAE: Excuse me , girl . Time for me to go .
MOLLY: I do n't believe I 'm watching this .
SAM: Damn it . All right . I apologize .
ODA MAE: Monsieur has a message for you .
SAM: Molly , you 're in danger .
ODA MAE: You ca n't tell her like that . And would you stop movin ' all over the place ? You 're makin ' me sick .
SAM: Say it !
ODA MAE: He 's sayin ' you 're in danger .
MOLLY: Danger ? What do you mean ?
SAM: I know the man who killed me . Willie Lopez . I know where he lives .
ODA MAE: He says he knows the man who killed him , Willie Lopez . He 's Puerto Rican .
SAM: Write it down .

SAM: Molly , he 's got my wallet and my key . He was in here .
ODA MAE: He 's got his wallet and key . He was in here .
MOLLY: In here ?
SAM: You have to go to the police . The Mugger was n't acting alone . It was a setup , Moll . I was murdered .
ODA MAE: He says he was set up , that he was murdered . He wants you to go to the police .
SAM: Where you going ?
ODA MAE: Do n't follow me ! I 've done all I 'm gon na do . I 'm finished . And I ai n't comin ' ack . So do n't you come botherin ' me again cause it 's over . I mean it . This is it . Have a nice life . Have a nice death . I 'm goin ' .
CARL: Molly , there 's no one on earth who 'd like it to be true more than me , but you 've got to be rational about this . I understand your desire to hold on to him , but this this is absurd .
MOLLY: It was real , Carl . She was real .
SAM: Listen to her , Carl , goddamn it . She needs some support here .
CARL: Molly , you 're a grown woman . How can you believe some fortune teller from Brooklyn ?
MOLLY: She was in touch with him .
CARL: I do n't believe it , Molly . Not for a minute .
SAM: Come on , Carl . Open your mind . Carl sits down beside her .
MOLLY: Carl , she knew things .
CARL: What kind of things ?
MOLLY: I told you , the picture in Reno , the starfish , damn it , Carl . She said Sam knew who killed him . That he was set up murdered .
CARL: Oh boy . This is getting deranged . We 're going off the deep end here .
SAM: Give him the address , Moll .
MOLLY: She had a name , an address Willie Lopez , 321 Prospect Place . She said he had Sam 's wallet .
CARL: This is sick . This is really sick . How can you swallow this crap ? Who knows if this guy exists ? Maybe she 's just setting someone up .
MOLLY: That 's what I have to find out .
CARL: Find out ? What are you talking about ?
MOLLY: Sam wants me to go to the police .
CARL: Sam wants you to go to the police ? Molly ! Jesus ! Are you outta you mind ? What are you gon na tell 'em ? Some storefront psychic 's been getting messages from the dead ? Do you know how that sounds ? You 're talkin ' ghosts here , for God 's sake . Molly looks suddenly vulnerable .
MOLLY: You do n't believe me . You do n't elieve any of this , do you ?
CARL: I 'm trying to , but Look , if it 'll make you sleep any better , I 'll check it out , okay ? Now why do n't you go to bed . Try and get some sleep .
SAM: Way to go , Carl !
WILLIE: Carl , what 're you doin ' here ?
CARL: Who 've you been talking to ?
WILLIE: Talking to ? What the hell do you mean ? What 's going on ?
CARL: Some woman knows all about you . The murder , everything . Where 's she getting it from , huh ?
WILLIE: What the hell are you talking about ? I have n't said a word . Sam is staggered . His body is shaking .
CARL: She knows your name , goddamn it ! She knows where you live !
WILLIE: A lot of women know where I live . Carl is fuming .
CARL: This is n't a joke , man . You find that bitch , whoever she is , and get rid of her , you hear me ? I 've got four million dollars stuck in that fucking computer . If I do n't get those codes , if that money 's not transferred soon , I 'm dead . If I lose Balistrari 's money , we 're both dead .
WILLIE: Tell him you only wash dirty money on the first of the month .
CARL: What is wrong with you ? Is everything a joke ? You were supposed to steal his wallet . You were n't supposed to kill him . Was that a joke ?
WILLIE: I did you a favor . Freebee .
CARL: Jesus ! These are drug dealers , man . Do n't blow this for me , Willie . I 've isked my job here . I could go to jail . A hundred thousand of that money goes to me . Now give me Sam 's key . I 'll get that address book myself .
SAM: You killed me , Carl . You had me killed . Look what you 've done to me ! Look what you 've done !
MOLLY: You white fascist bigot . Who do you think you are ? Bed Stuy 's part of New York , you know . This is America .
WOMAN: Hey , Snow , you lost or sumpin ' ?
MOLLY: Look , you 've got ta believe me . I do n't even believe this stuff , myself . But this is real . Do you think I 'd come here if it was n't real ? You told me to come if I had any new information . Well , here I am . The officers do n't respond .
WALLACE: How intimate ?
MOLLY: Things Sam only said to me .
WALLACE: Okay , let me get this straight . According to this psychic lady , there are ghosts and spirits all over the place , watching us all the time , huh ? I 'm sorry . I 've got important things to do .
MOLLY: I 'm telling you . The killer 's name is Willie Lopez . I 've got his address . You 've got to check it out .
SGT. BEIDERMAN: Okay . You just wait here . Let me see if this guy 's got a record .
MOLLY: What are you doing ? Where 's you file on Willie Lopez ?
SGT. BEIDERMAN: There 's no file for a Willie Lopez . He was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with . This psychic woman 's record goes ack a long way . Fraud , numbers ackets , you name it . She 's a real pro .
MOLLY: This is n't possible . There were words , private things . How could she have known all that ?
SGT. BEIDERMAN: They have ways .
MOLLY: Ways ? What ways ?
SGT. BEIDERMAN: They 've got a million cons . A lot of times they read the obits . All she had to do was see the word `` banker '' . Hell , they even go through you garbage to find things they can use , letters , old papers . They do n't need much . Molly turns away .
MOLLY: No ! She was real . She said things . She knew about a sweater I knitted , about songs we sang She knew about this place we went , Montego Bay Molly begins to cry .
SGT. BEIDERMAN: I 'm sorry . I know this is hard . People want so much to believe . They 're grieving , vulnerable . They 'd give anything for one last moment money , insurance policies . Believe me , these people know what they 're doing . Look , I know how you must feel . You know , you can press charges .
MOLLY: Oh God , I wanted it to be Sam .
CARL: God , let this be it !

MOLLY: Sure .
MOLLY: Are you alright ? You look nervous , upset .
CARL: What can I tell you . It 's been tough . Hell , you know . It still hurts so much . Then on top of it all it 's the esponsibilities . They 've given me my own accounts , but I 've had no time to adjust . My mind has been eeling .
MOLLY: I did n't have time . I went to the police , Carl .
CARL: You 're kidding . You really did it ? I do n't believe What did you tell them ? What did they say ?
MOLLY: You were right , you know . I felt like such a fool . They brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick . It was awful .
CARL: A ripoff artist , huh ?
SAM: Molly , no .
MOLLY: The sad part is that I believed her . I believed her , Carl . It was all a sham .
CARL: Sometimes we need to believe .
MOLLY: Why ? I was a fool . I do n't believe anything anymore . Why would people do such things ? Sam is devastated .
CARL: It 's hard to face reality , Moll , the hard cold facts of it . What you have to remember is the love you felt . That 's what 's real . You have to emember how good Sam was . How much he loved you .
MOLLY: I feel so alone .
CARL: You 're not alone . You 're young . You 've got so much talent . You 're fantastically gorgeous .
MOLLY: Oh God , I do n't know what 's real anymore . I do n't know what to think .

CARL: I 'll check the building .
WILLIE: Damn !
WILLIE: Oh God !
CARL: Look out !
ODA MAE: Sam ? What happened ?
SAM: He 's dead , Oda Mae .
ODA MAE: Dead ! Oh , thank God . It 's over .
SAM: No . It 's not over , Oda Mae . There 's still Carl . Oda Mae freezes . She turns to Sam .
ODA MAE: Who 's Carl ?
SAM: Tell him to hurry !
ODA MAE: Ca n't you hurry up ?
DRIVER: Listen , lady , I 'm going as fast as I can .
ODA MAE: Problems ? He gives her a dirty look .
MOLLY: Carl , is that you ? Oda Mae wedges her foot inside .
ODA MAE: Molly , it 's Oda Mae . I know what you think of me , but your life is in danger . You have to listen to me . Sam 's here , too . You got ta let us in .
MOLLY: Get the hell out of here . I 'm calling the police .
ODA MAE: Go ahead . We want you to call 'em . You 're in trouble . Let us in .
MOLLY: No !
ODA MAE: Sam 's death was no accident . He was murdered , Molly . Carl was laundering money at the bank . Sam found out . He 's dangerous . He tried to kill me . He 'll kill you , too .
MOLLY: Why are you doing this to me ? Get away from me ! I know all about you . You 're a fake . You 're just a fake . Leave me alone !
SAM: Tell her she 's wearing the blouse I spilled the Margarita on and the earrings I gave her for Christmas .
ODA MAE: Sam says you 're wearin ' the blouse he spilled the Margarita on and the earrings he gave you at Christmas .
SAM: Gim me a penny quick .
ODA MAE: What ?
SAM: Empty your purse . On the floor . Now .
MOLLY: Right . Yes , it 's right on the corner . We 're a red brick building with the entrance on the left side . Please hurry . Thank you Sergeant . We 'll be waiting right here . Police are on their way . Oda Mae takes her and leads her to the couch .
ODA MAE: Just wait . There is a period of awkward silence .
MOLLY: Is Sam here ?
SAM: I 'm sitting beside you .
ODA MAE: Right here .
MOLLY: Can you feel me , Sam ?
SAM: With all my heart .
ODA MAE: With all his heart , he says .
SAM: I 'd give anything to be alive again , just to feel you once more .
ODA MAE: He wishes he could touch you , just one more time .
MOLLY: Oh , Sam .
ODA MAE: Okay , damn it , you can use me if you want . Sam looks oddly at Oda Mae .
MOLLY: Sam !
MOLLY: The police !
SAM: No !
ODA MAE: Wait !
SAM: What 's happening to me ? His ghostly functions are diminishing . There is another KNOCK and a voice rings out .
MOLLY: It 's Carl !
SAM: Get out of here ! The fire escape . Oda Mae grabs Molly .
ODA MAE: Come with me .
CARL: Molly ! It is obvious that no one 's home .
ODA MAE: Back to the fire escape . Head fo the roof .
MOLLY: This way !
ODA MAE: Help us , Sam !
CARL: I want the check . Just give me the check .
MOLLY: God almighty , Carl ! What are you doing ? What have you done ! ? She descends quickly and runs toward Carl .
CARL: Do n't interfere ! She 's a thief . It 's not her money .
ODA MAE: In my purse .
CARL: Where ?
ODA MAE: Over there . She points across the room .
CARL: Where is it , goddamn it ? Where is it ?
ODA MAE: I gave it away .
CARL: You 're lying ! Do n't lie to me !
CARL: Sam ? Sam ?
CARL: Sam ?
SAM: Goodbye , Moll . Molly 's head lifts up . She looks around .
MOLLY: Sam ? Is that you ?
SAM: Molly ? !
MOLLY: I hear you , Sam . She starts to cry .
SAM: I ca n't stay anymore . Tears roll down her cheek .
ODA MAE: They 're waiting for you , Sam .
SAM: I know . Goodbye , Oda Mae . Thank you . Your mama would be proud . Oda Mae smiles warmly .
MOLLY: Ditto .
SAM: It 's so amazing , Moll His face fills with joy .
MOLLY: See ya .
THE END: < /pre
BEAUMONT: John Henry Patterson , come in . I 'm Robert Beaumont . Firm- I like that , tells me a lot about you- -now why do n't you tell me about me ? To get you started , many people find me handsome , with a wonderful smile . I 'm sure you agree . Winning personality , heaps of charm ?
PATTERSON: My wife is the game player in the family , sir .
BEAUMONT: Games ? Look at me closely , Patterson I am a monster . My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me , such as yourself . One mistake and I promise you this I 'll make you hate me .
BEAUMONT: We are building this railroad across Africa for the glorious purpose of saving Africa from the Africans . And , of course , to end slavery . The Germans and French are our competition . We are ahead , and we will stay ahead providing you do what I hired you to do-
BEAUMONT: -build the bridge over the Tsavo iver . And be finished in fou months time . Can you do that ?
PATTERSON: I 'm sure you 've examined my record . So you know I 've never yet been late on a bridge .
BEAUMONT: You 've never built in Africa .
PATTERSON: But I have in India- every country presents problems .
BEAUMONT: You 'll need your confidence , I promise you .
PATTERSON: I 've got a reason far beyond confidence my wife is having ou firstborn in five months and I promised I 'd be with her when the aby comes .
BEAUMONT: Very moving , Patterson ; I 'm touched you confided in me . But I do n't really give a shit about your upcoming litter . I 've made you with this assignment- -do n't make me break you .
PATTERSON: You wo n't have the chance . Any further words of encouragement ? Then I 've a train to catch .
HELENA: I tried to be late , John- it would have been easier if you 'd gone .
PATTERSON: We 're not much good at goodbyes , Helena .
HELENA: Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are , how lucky he is to have you ?
PATTERSON: It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments .
HELENA: Oh dear- -you 're geting that downtrodden look again-
PATTERSON: -well , it 's just other men do n't abandon their wives at such a time-
HELENA: -oh please- if I 'd been against you taking this , you would have abandoned me . You 've been desperate to see Africa your whole life .
PATTERSON: What if there are complications ? -
HELENA: -not `` what if '' - there will be , there always are . Which only means that ou `` son '' and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit . THE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds .
PATTERSON: I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving .
HELENA: You build bridges , John- -you 've got to go where the rivers are .
STARLING: Many thanks . You 're Patterson , yes ? Nigel Starling- I 'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that .
PATTERSON: He just gave me his `` monster '' speech .
STARLING: That . I know Robert seems dreadful , ut when you truly get to know the man , well , he 's much worse . And I 'm one of his defenders . Forget him for now- it 's your first ide to Tsavo- I think you 'll find it eathtaking .
PATTERSON: `` Breathtaking '' does n't begin to do it justice .
STARLING: Are n't they amazing ?
PATTERSON: You know the most amazing thing about them ? - they only sleep five minutes a day .
STARLING: Do n't much like them .
PATTERSON: The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they would n't survive because the males eat the young .
STARLING: Anything special about them ?
PATTERSON: Just that they fart through thei mouths . Must make kissing something of a gamble .
STARLING: I 've lived in Africa a year and I do n't know what you know . How long have you been here ?
PATTERSON: Almost three hours . But I 've been getting ready all my life .
STARLING: Every time I see something like that , I know we 're right to be here- to ing Christianity into their lives , enrich their souls .
PATTERSON: Beaumont says it 's to end slavery .
STARLING: We all have our reasons . Mine is simply to make them understand happiness , accept salvation , know the serenity that comes- -best I stop . One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring . But I know God smiles on me .
PATTERSON: Have you got that in writing ?
STARLING: Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts .
PATTERSON: Does he speak English ?
SAMUEL: And very poor French .
STARLING: Samuel- John Patterson .
SAMUEL: The bridgebuilder- -we have been getting ready fo you .
PATTERSON: Excellent . Could I see the bridge site ?
STARLING: I 've got medical supplies to deliver . Come along to the hospital when you 're done .
SAMUEL: I will bring him , Nigel .
PATTERSON: Why do the workers look unhappy ?
SAMUEL: Because they are here . Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world . Come , John- to the bridge .
PATTERSON: It 's all wonderfully under control , Samuel- you 've done a splendid job .
SAMUEL: Thank you . The truth is this you have to work at it constantly .
PATTERSON: The workers do n't get on ?
SAMUEL: Get on ? They detest each other . Obviously the Africans hate the Indians . But the Indians also hate the other Indians . Some of them worship cows , while others eat them .
SAMUEL: Railhead is across there .
SAMUEL: Three thousand men laying track- when the bridge is done , it all joins up .
PATTERSON: This is more difficult-
PATTERSON: -but how wonderful that it 's difficult , it should be difficult- what better job in all the world than build a bridge ? - make things connect- bring worlds together- and get it right !
STARLING: Finish your tour ?
PATTERSON: And anxious to get started . What is this , mostly malaria ?
STARLING: Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts , He will vanquish all pain . MAN 'S VOICE That 's just vomitous talk , Nigel- the poor bastards will relapse if you keep on that way .
HAWTHORNE: I 'm David Hawthorne , this is my hospital . And my advice to you is , `` do n't get sick in front of it . '' That was meant to be charming , sorry . I seem to have lost the knack .
STARLING: You never had it .
HAWTHORNE: Nigel and I do n't like each other much .
SAMUEL: I am also liaison between these two .
PATTERSON: Clearly you do n't agree about building the railroad ?
HAWTHORNE: This sham ? Ridiculous . Who needs it ? It 's only being built to control the ivory trade , make men richer .
PATTERSON: Then why do you stay ?
HAWTHORNE: Who else would hire me ? Beat you to it , did n't I ? Oh yes , almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift .
HAWTHORNE: This is Karim , one of my orderlies- attacked by a man-eater earlie today- first incident of that kind here .
STARLING: A man-eater attacks and you 're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it ?
HAWTHORNE: Well , he got away , did n't he ? Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off .
HAWTHORNE: I know it 's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- -but what are you going to do about it ?
PATTERSON: Karim will have to show me where it happened . And of course , I 'll need the donkey . With any luck , I 'll sort it out tonight .
STARLING: I could n't believe it when you said `` sort it out . '' As if it were the most normal thing in the world . `` Ho-hum , what lovely tea , I think I 'll bag a killer beast this evening , nothing much else going on anyway . ''
PATTERSON: Well , he put me in a spot , did n't he ? But that 's all right- after all , I 'm esponsible for everything that happens here . And it certainly wo n't do much for morale if a man-eater 's on the prowl .
STARLING: You said `` of course '' you 'd need the donkey . Why `` of course '' ?
PATTERSON: We know three things about man-eaters . First , they always return to where they 've attacked before . Second , they 're always old- they ca n't catch othe animals so they turn to us . And third , they 're always alone- they 've been cast out by their pride because they ca n't keep up .
STARLING: I do n't suppose I could watch .
PATTERSON: Might be exciting for you .
STARLING: I 've never been all that adventurous . I would n't be in the way ?
PATTERSON: I 'd love the company . And I 've hunted all my life .
STARLING: Well , why not ? You seem so calm and experienced . Why not , indeed !
STARLING: I hate to be a bother , John , but the cramp 's getting worse . The pain is actually quite unbearable now .
PATTERSON: Shhh .
STARLING: I 'm sure you mean that to be comforting , ut-
PATTERSON: -you 'll have to deal with it , Nigel .
STARLING: That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent .
PATTERSON: They own the night- nobody moves when there 's a man-eater out there . Starling glumly obeys . Then-
STARLING: John ? I know this is n't the time to ask , ut-
PATTERSON: What ?
STARLING: Since you 'd only been here three hours when we met , are you sure this is how you hunt lions ?
PATTERSON: Not to terrify you , Nigel , but it 's worse than you think- I 've never even seen one .
STARLING: one shot
PATTERSON: So that 's what a lion looks like .
SAMUEL: Patterson has made the nights safe again .
PATTERSON: All right , I 'd like to start the embankments today- -sufficient supplies on hand ?
SINGH: More than .
STARLING: With much more on the way- -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
PATTERSON: -true enough- but without the comedy elief .
PATTERSON: How lucky we are .
STARLING: Are n't we full of ourselves today ? I think it 's because of the lion .
PATTERSON: Possibly .
SINGH: You know , I too have killed a lion .
STARLING: How many shots did you need ?
SINGH: I used my hands .
PATTERSON: All right- thee second embankment will go there .
STARLING: You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just- - '' there . ''
PATTERSON: In your honor , Nigel . And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you 'll also build the oadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you 'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks .
STARLING: John , it will not be easy .
PATTERSON: Nigel , you 'll just have to use you hands-
PATTERSON: What are they looking at ?
SAMUEL: You- they can not believe you 're still here .
PATTERSON: Nonsense .
SAMUEL: You do n't know what Tsavo means , do you ? It means `` slaughter ''
HAWTHORNE: -then he feasted on him , starting with his feet-
STARLING: -please- you need n't be so graphic-
HAWTHORNE: You intend `` sorting this out '' tonight ?
PATTERSON: I 'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could neve carry off a man Singh 's size .
STARLING: But you said they were always old .
PATTERSON: That 's what the books say
PATTERSON: You were contracted to work-
ABDULLAH: -malaria epidemic ; very sudden .
PATTERSON: Let me see the sick .
ABDULLAH: Oh , you 're a doctor now , too ?
PATTERSON: There is no reason for fear .
ABDULLAH: On that I choose to remain dubious . Two are dead now in two nights .
PATTERSON: Second death ? Where ? -
STARLING: -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night . Hawthorne 's examining the ody now . There 's even less of him than of Singh .
PATTERSON: But it 's crazy- the lion should n't be that hungry this soon . Samuel ?
SAMUEL: We should construct thorn fences around every tent area . Fires burning at night .
PATTERSON: Fine . Get started . And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night . Send half your men to the bridge , the est with these two . And I 'm sorry for my tone earlier . But I repeat- there is no reason for fear . I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge .
ABDULLAH: Of course you will , you are white , you can do anything
STARLING: Not good enough- look , it 's got to e tighter . Tighter .
STARLING: What a good week .
PATTERSON: You mean nobody died ?
STARLING: We all worked together . Worthy deeds were accomplished . I liked the labor . My mother insisted on piano lessons- oke the dear woman 's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands . I like the blood , is that strange ?
SAMUEL: Oh yes , I think so .
PATTERSON: Look out , Samuel , here it comes .
STARLING: Even you two must admit that it is a glorious thing , what Man can accomplish . When there is a common splendid goal , there are no limits . Think what we will accomplish when we all have God 's warmth in our hearts .
STARLING: I am immune to your disdain . When I came here , I had but one small goal to convert the entire continent of Africa . Now I 've decided to move on to something really difficult I will not est until both of you are safely in the fold .
SAMUEL: I 've had four wives , good luck .
STARLING: The struggle is the glory
SAMUEL: For you .
PATTERSON: Thank you , Samuel .
SAMUEL: Good news ?
PATTERSON: I expect so- it 's from my wife .
SAMUEL: Do you love her ?
PATTERSON: I do , actually ; very much .
SAMUEL: You give me hope , John .
HELENA: That was an attempt at humor but I do n't feel very funny these days . I miss you terribly and after our son- I still have total confidence- well , after he 's born I think travel might e broadening . As he kicks me at night I 'm quite sure he 's telling me he definitely wants to come to Africa . Thought you might need reminding .
PATTERSON: Jesus , two of them
PATTERSON: -oh , sing a different song , Abdullah- -there 's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
ABDULLAH: -you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- conside yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
PATTERSON: You think you matter ? -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
PATTERSON: He sees this chaos , he 'll replace you all .
ABDULLAH: He 'll replace you , too- that 's all you really care about .
PATTERSON: You think so ? Fine . It 's best you get out . Go . Tell all your people to go , run home where they 'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the ailroad is done , they can tell thei women that out of all the thousands who worked here , they were the only ones to flee-
PATTERSON: Pleasant journey ?
BEAUMONT: How could it be ? I hate Africa .
BEAUMONT: Lovely sound- they seem happy .
PATTERSON: Do n't they , though ?
BEAUMONT: So work must be going well ?
PATTERSON: Truthfully ? There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then , as you so wisely told me , I 'd never built in Africa .
BEAUMONT: But overall , you 're pleased ?
SAMUEL: I have never experienced anything like it .
BEAUMONT: I almost feel like getting right ack on .
BEAUMONT: I suppose it would be a dereliction of duty not to at least look around . Now Abdullah wanders happily by .
PATTERSON: Morning , friend , glorious day .
ABDULLAH: As are they all .
BEAUMONT: I do need to see Starling .
PATTERSON: Starling ?
BEAUMONT: Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I 've brought them . Is he here ?
PATTERSON: Yes he is .
BEAUMONT: Well , I need to speak to him .
SAMUEL: Let me deliver the bibles .
BEAUMONT: Excellent show . Where is Starling ?
PATTERSON: Here he comes now .
BEAUMONT: What in hell is going on ?
SAMUEL: The Ghost and The Darkness have come .
BEAUMONT: In English .
PATTERSON: It 's what the natives are calling the lions- -two lions have been causing trouble-
BEAUMONT: -what 's the surprise in that , this is Africa ?
PATTERSON: It has n't been that simple so far .
BEAUMONT: What have they done besides kill Starling ? How many have they killed ?
HAWTHORNE: Well , of course , I ca n't supply a totally accurate answer because there are those that are actually authenticated and there are those that we once thought were workers killing each other or deserting from camp so any number I give is subject to error-
BEAUMONT: How many ?
HAWTHORNE: Thirty , I should think .
BEAUMONT: Christ ! What are you doing about it ?
BEAUMONT: This is supposed to be salvation ? What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here ?
PATTERSON: I 'm calling it my `` contraption '' - we 're going to surround it with a oma- a fence , to you- and we 're going to leave a small opening opposite that door .
PATTERSON: In that half will be bait- human ait- I 'll start things off- -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor .
BEAUMONT: Genius- the beast will enter , tripping the wire , the door will slide down , trapping him , you , safe ehind the bars , will have him at your mercy and will shoot him . Patterson nods . Beaumont explodes .
PATTERSON: I did n't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger .
BEAUMONT: And it worked ?
PATTERSON: In point of fact , it did n't . But I 'm convinced the theory is sound .
PATTERSON: What ?
BEAUMONT: I made a mistake hiring you- you 're simply not up to the job .
PATTERSON: You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people , do n't you ? Well , fine- -except there is n't a higher rated engineer and we both know that . And since time is so important to you , how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and ing him here ?
BEAUMONT: Let me explain about time- you 've een here three months and already two months behind . And the Germans and the French are gearing up . And I do n't care about you and I do n't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this ailroad finishes on schedule , I 'll get my knighthood and I want it . Professional hunters may be the answer .
PATTERSON: All they 'll bring is more chaos and we 've plenty of that already- and if they come in , word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then ?
BEAUMONT: I 'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you 've heard of him .
PATTERSON: Every man who 's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him , the lions will be dead .
BEAUMONT: Very well , the job 's still yours , I 'll go . But if I have to return , you 're finished . And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation . Am I not fair ? Told you you 'd hate me .
PATTERSON: I do hate him . I want you to distribute one bag of flares to every tent area- -tell the men to light them if there 's trouble- -make it two bags .
PATTERSON: Very good indeed .
MIDDLE COOLIE: We have hunted since childhood .
PATTERSON: All right- you 'll spend your nights inside . You 'll have plenty of ammunition . You 're totally protected , you have eally nothing to fear .
MIDDLE COOLIE: That is correct . Nothing .
PATTERSON: Not once ? - you did n't hit it once ? -
MIDDLE COOLIE: -I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
PATTERSON: -well , of course he kept moving- but he could n't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
MIDDLE COOLIE: I assure you we came close many times-
ABDULLAH: The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
PATTERSON: -that 's ridiculous talk and you ca n't seriously believe it-
ABDULLAH: -now you 're telling me my beliefs ? - I do n't think so-
PATTERSON: I was n't and you know it and do n't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
ABDULLAH: -at last you 're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
PATTERSON: -careful , Abdullah-
ABDULLAH: You do not tell me `` careful '' - you do not tell me anything- you listen while I talk-
REDBEARD: No hints , Samuel .
ABDULLAH: You do n't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo .
REDBEARD: You 're right . The Devil has come . Look at me . I am the Devil .
ABDULLAH: I am a man of peace .
REDBEARD: Am I to take it you want to live ?
ABDULLAH: Most certainly . Absolutely . Yes .
REDBEARD: Excellent decision . Your name is Abdullah ? I 'm sure we 'll meet again . Go and enjoy the splendid morning .
ABDULLAH: I think it 's been a pleasure .
REDBEARD: You got old . I 'm sure you 're John Patterson . Stay out of my way .
PATTERSON: I did n't have a chance to thank you .
REDBEARD: What did I do ?
PATTERSON: Got me out of trouble .
REDBEARD: Nonsense- Samuel would have done something .
PATTERSON: We need to talk .
REDBEARD: Let me save time- you are the engineer ; you are in charge ; you 're sorry I 'm here . Right so far ? Good- because I am not an engineer , I do n't want to be in charge , and I 'm sorrier than you are that I 'm here- I hate Tsavo . So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving , and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave . See any problems ?
PATTERSON: Actually , no .
REDBEARD: All right- let 's go into battle . I 'm Redbeard .
PATTERSON: Somehow I guessed .
REDBEARD: Starting now , we attack them .
ABDULLAH: How ; we do n't know where they are ?
REDBEARD: We 'll have to make them come to us , wo n't we ? And since there are two of them , we 're going to set two plans in motion . First we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night .
HAWTHORNE: That 's a terrible idea-
REDBEARD: -is it , I 'm sorry , but then , of course , you 're the doctor , you should know .
HAWTHORNE: Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that ?
REDBEARD: I suppose I could answer you . I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting , what with the smell of blood and flesh , that they have to strike . It 's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they 're already contemplating feasting here . But I do n't want to answer you ecause when you question me you are eally saying that I do n't have the least idea what I am doing , that I am nothing but an incompetent , that I am a fool . Anyone who finds me a fool , please say so now .
HAWTHORNE: I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived .
REDBEARD: Then we agree .
SAMUEL: Soon .
PATTERSON: I have to ask- why do you need me ?
REDBEARD: I do n't really . But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out- -when I 'm gone , you 'll still have to build the bridge . And I do n't want the men to have lost respect for you .
PATTERSON: That 's very considerate .
REDBEARD: I 'm always considerate- my mothe taught me that .
REDBEARD: Why do you laugh ? - you do n't elieve she taught me ?
SAMUEL: I do n't believe you had a mother .
PATTERSON: You like him , do n't you ?
SAMUEL: Oh yes . But it takes time .
PATTERSON: You 've known him long ?
SAMUEL: Since his beard was red .
SAMUEL: How many cattle ?
REDBEARD: Four should do it .
SAMUEL: They will want a lot of money .
PATTERSON: Have you got it ?
REDBEARD: No , but you do- -see , you were needed after all . And fifty warriors at the camp efore dawn .
SAMUEL: Why so many ?
REDBEARD: Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle , the other the men .
SAMUEL: The Ghost and the Darkness have come and we can do nothing ut if you anger them they will stay in Tsavo and life will ecome more unberable , that I know
REDBEARD: Two lions are all that have come they 're only lions , that I know . And I will kill them both tomorrow .
HAWTHORNE: You 're certain about tomorrow ? But you do n't seem excited .
PATTERSON: You do n't enjoy killing , do you ?
HAWTHORNE: Then why do it ?
REDBEARD: I have a gift .
HAWTHORNE: Strange man . Has he always been this way ?
SAMUEL: Much gentler now .
HAWTHORNE: John ? - Change guns with me- mine 's much more powerful . I 'll be finishing the hospital tomorrow so I wo n't e with you- but if you 'll use this then I will . Patterson , touched , changes weapons .
PATTERSON: Thank you . Why does he need you by him ?
SAMUEL: He does n't . He needs nobody . But we have hunted many times he knows I am afraid of lions
REDBEARD: I spotted one of them- -in there .
REDBEARD: The best way to ensure the kill when you 're using trackers is fo one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter . Have you eve led trackers ?
PATTERSON: I can try .
REDBEARD: Samuel says you killed a lion .
PATTERSON: It was probably luck- I 'd rathe you did the shooting .
REDBEARD: You 'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck . Around there 's a clearing- you 'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I 'll make the lion come directly to you .
REDBEARD: -all of you- spread the width of the clearing- no gaps- go-
REDBEARD: Shoot for chrissakes ! -
SAMUEL: Did you ever see a lion that size ?
REDBEARD: Not even close . What happened ?
PATTERSON: misfire it jammed
REDBEARD: Has it ever done that before ?
PATTERSON: do n't know
SAMUEL: It 's Hawthorne 's .
REDBEARD: You exchanged weapons ? You went into battle with an untried gun ?
REDBEARD: They have an expression in prizefighting `` everyone has a plan until they 're hit . '' You 've just been hit the getting up is up to you
REDBEARD: Gentlemen , there 's no sickness smell at all here , and little blood . When we leave , close the gate securely , do n't open it til morning and keep your fires high . Any questions , ask them now . You two will sleep beautifully in your tents . And stay there .
SAMUEL: And where will you sleep beautifully ?
REDBEARD: Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- -and by the time we 're done , I promise you , the odor of blood will e irresistible .
REDBEARD: Think about something else .
PATTERSON: Have you ever failed ?
REDBEARD: Only in life
PATTERSON: Goddammit !
REDBEARD: It 's all right . Stay ready . They know it 's there .
REDBEARD: Meant to ask you- the railroad ca trap . Your idea ? Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once .
PATTERSON: But of course yours worked .
REDBEARD: In point of fact it didn't- but I 'm convinced the idea is sound .
REDBEARD: It would have been a beautiful idge , John . I never noticed efore , occupied with othe usiness , I suppose never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I 've had the time today , nothing else on , and this it 's graceful and the placement could n't be prettier and
PATTERSON: You just got hit . The getting up is up to you- but they 're only lions- -and I 'm going after them crack of dawn
REDBEARD: In my town , when I was little , there was a brute , a bully who terrorized the place . But he was not the problem . He had a brother who was worse than he . But the brother was not the problem . One or the other of them was usually in jail . The problem came when they were both free togther . The two became different from either alone . Alone they were only brutes . Together they became lethal , together they killed .
PATTERSON: What happened to them ?
REDBEARD: I got big .
REDBEARD: Dear God-
PATTERSON: Their den ? Have you ever seen anything like this ?
REDBEARD: Nobody 's seen anything like this . Lions do n't have caves like this- -they 're doing it for pleasure .
REDBEARD: One of my chief attributes is that I 'm always calm .
PATTERSON: Where could it have gone ? How could it get across the water ? They 're only lions , yes ?
REDBEARD: Do n't they have to be ?
SAMUEL: Both of them over there .
PATTERSON: Ever have to use a machan ? I did once . In India . We will tonight .
PATTERSON: They 're used to people in trees , not in a clearing . It may be tight .
REDBEARD: Not for me- I 'm too bulky and it 's your idea , you go up there . Take the others to the water towe for the night .
PATTERSON: I 'll be bait alone ?
REDBEARD: Yes . And I 'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever . Can you control your fear ?
PATTERSON: I 'll have to .
REDBEARD: I ca n't control mine- I 'd be lost without the shame factor driving me .
PATTERSON: Was that supposed to make me feel etter ?
REDBEARD: It 's certainly the best chance they 've had to kill you .
PATTERSON: You think they 'll come then ? Why ?
REDBEARD: Good luck .
PATTERSON: Why ?
REDBEARD: Because I think they 're after you .
PATTERSON: How many do you think they 've killed ?
REDBEARD: The most of any lions a hundred ? Probably more . Johnny ?
BEAUMONT: I think another for posterity- this is an important moment in my life .
PATTERSON: -not a time for modesty , Bob-
REDBEARD: -undeniably your triumph .
BEAUMONT: Oh surely there 's enough credit for us all- let 's not forget , you did the actual shooting . Of course , I hired you , I was the general who put the team together . And generals are the ones who tend to be emembered .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Perhaps you might put your head in its mouth , sir- could be a corker .
BEAUMONT: Clever idea , I like it .
PATTERSON: I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'm glad you came .
REDBEARD: Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me .
PATTERSON: Actually , I could have done it much more easily without you , but for whatever reason , I 'm glad you came .
SAMUEL: Where do you go next ?
REDBEARD: Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas . You ?
SAMUEL: Help finish the railroad .
PATTERSON: I want to meet my son- he must be what , two months old ? They look at the fire a moment . Then-
SAMUEL: Three years I 've worked for the ailroad . Now I do n't know why . It seemed a good idea once .
PATTERSON: I feel the same about the bridge . This country certainly did n't ask for it , does n't need it .
REDBEARD: Too soon to tell . They look at him .
SAMUEL: Some mysteries should not have solutions .
REDBEARD: Hold your son high .
PATTERSON: He has children ?
SAMUEL: Once
HELENA: Could you tell him that his wife- -that his family has come to see him .
PATTERSON: You 're positive lions hate baboons ? Pebbles ? Let 's get it over with .
PATTERSON: Where is it ?
SAMUEL: Underneath . Somewhere .
SAMUEL: Afraid of lions .
PATTERSON: It 's all right , Samuel- we all get hit-
PATTERSON: Samuel !
LITTLE MIKE: where do you chink you 're going , Blaze ?
BLAZE: Sick , cutting out early .
LITTLE MIKE: The hell you are !
BLAZE: Aaa n ? You say that every time .
LITTLE MIKE: Well I mean it this time !

LAUGHING: Candy from a baby !
BLAZE: Thank you gentlemen , that 's it for today !
TO CHUCK: Hon , would you pass me the vegetables .
CHUCK: So how 're things going at the shop , John ?
BLAZE: Good , good .
CHUCK: Yeah ? Cause Mike says you 've been slacking off , horsing around .
ALL SMILES: It 's okay , Rox .
CHUCK: You were saying ?
BLAZE: ( distracted , looking to the
DOOR: Right , so anyway
BLAZE: Lucas . Rick .
COLE: Johnny . We 'd like you to come down the station .
INSOLENT: Can I finish eating ?
TERSE: It is by now . Just let me know if you 're staying overnight . She goes back to her dinner .
BLAZE: Hey .
SLURRED: You 're going to jail .
BLAZE: No . No . Everything 's okay . Jed and Murph just got a little boisterous at The Prairie Dog last night . Cops wanted to ead us the riot act , that 's all
ROXANNE: I was worried about you . And I do n't like your friends .
BLAZE: Listen , I want to show you something
ROXANNE: I 'm sure you do . But I 'm half-asleep and you 're an ass-hole .
BLAZE: I 'm serious , Rox . This is important .
ROXANNE: John , I have to go to work tomorrow
BLAZE: Put your coat on . You 'll be glad you did . Promise . It 'll be an adventure . A mystery tour .
ROXANNE: This better be good .
COYOTE EYES: glittering black , watching .
BLAZE: Keep going . It 's just up there .
ROXANNE: I 'm not riding one of those stupid horses .
BLAZE: You do n't have to ride , just climb up .
ROXANNE: You 're going to have to grow up one day , Johnny Blaze .
BLAZE: Not if I can help it .
TURNING BACK: What ?
BLAZE: Ever hear of a carnival wedding ?
ROXANNE: You made that up .
BLAZE: Swear to God .
ROXANNE: It 's beautiful .
BLAZE: How 'd I ever find you ?
SHRUGGING: Fate ?
BLAZE: I do n't believe in fate .
ROXANNE: Maybe it believes in you .
BEAT: That 's not a life . At least not one I 'm interested in living .
BLAZE: I know . I 'm gon na get my shit together . For Leal , this time ,
EARNEST: I promise you , Rox . I 'll always be there for you .
ROXANNE: Do n't promise me , promise her .
BLAZE: We got ta go . Get your stuff together .
ROXANNE: What happened ? What 's wrong ? Roxanne follows Blaze into the bedroom .
BLAZE: I fucked up . The police are coming . Grab your things . We have to go .
ON ROXANNE: standing in the doorway . She sawit all .
BLAZE: Fuck .
JOHN: Blaze floors the gas . The speedometer leaps .
ROXANNE: Slow down , John
COYOTE: or , the road , right in their path .
BLAZE: Roxanne ?
BLAZE: Get your fucking hands off me !
BLAZE: Is she going to make it ?
DOCTOR: Mr. Blaze , I
BLAZE: ) _a ch= going r4 make i r ?
DOCTOR: We do n't know . She 's critical . He injuries are grave . There 's a real chance she wo n't
BLAZE: What about the baby ? The doctor hesitates , glances at Cole .
DOCTOR: I 'm so sorry . We did everything we could .
STARKE: You look like you could use some help .
LOST: She 's dying . Starke nods , places a COIN in Blaze 's palm .
STARKE: If I could help her , would you be willing co make a deal ?
BLAZE: What kind of deal ?
STARKE: She lives . You work for me .
BLAZE: What kind of work ?
CLERK: Just passing through ?
DISTRACTED: What ?
CLERK: Where are you headed ? Late night , storm like this
NOMI: What do you care ?
CLERK: Just asking . He keeps packing . But he knows she 's trouble .
NOMI: It 's too much , baby . Put it back . I do n't have enough money for that .
WEATHERMAN: scattered thunderstorms firing along a stalled frontal boundary . Damaging winds , hail , and isolated tornadoes will e possible across the Dakotas and Uppe
NOMI: Seatbelt . Rain dutifully fastens herself in .
NOMI: Stay here . And lock the doors .
CARRIGAN: Well , if it is n't Little Miss Running Bear .
NOMI: Fuck you , Billy
CARRIGAN: Now I might just take you up on that , Nome . Old Billy-Ray 's been getting a little tired shaking hands with the governor , know what I 'm saying ?
LANDSDALE: Careful with her !
NOMI: Leave her alone !
ODELL: Fuck !
CARRI GAN: Tell you what , Hon . You want you goddamned divorce so much ?
ODELL: The hell was that ?
ALBRIGHT: What the fuck ? ! WHAT THE FUCK ? !
FUSCO: Oh God , please , I ai n't nothing to do with nothin ' . I ai n't nothin ' . Please ,
CARRIGAN: Did you kill it ?
LANDS DALE: Fuck if I know ! ! !
QUINLAN: Sir , you have to tell me your name .
BLAZE: I just need to sit down for a moment . And I need some forceps , gauze , tape
QUINLAN: I 'll decide what you need , alright ? Name ?
BLAZE: No , no . Do I look like troub-unghhh
TAKEN ABACK: Oh my . What happened to you ?
BLAZE: Motorcycle accident . Couple abrasions , maybe some rib fractures Just step back , I 'll handle it
QUINLAN: Those are bullet holes .
BLAZE: Nah . They 're just gouges . Surface damage . They 'll heal up fine . Ungh - do you have any painkillers ?
QUINLAN: ( assertive now , plainly
SUSPICIOUS: This was no motorcycle accident . Somebody has cauterized your wounds
BLAZE: Percocet ? Vicodin , maybe ?
QUINLAN: I 'm sorry but I need to report this . Stay right there .
BLAZE: Excuse me ?
NOMI: when they took my daughter .
BLAZE: I do n't know what you 're talking about
NOMI: Yes you do .
BLAZE: Lady , you do n't know shit . Now bark the fuck o t of my Ii
BLAZE: Like what ?
NOMI: This thing that 's riding you , the Ghost Rider . I guess it has a lot of names . But the one I grew up hearing was nagi ocanl sice . It means the Spirit of Vengeance .
BLAZE: You actually believe what you 're telling me ?
NOMI: You kidding ? I 'm pure-bred Dakota . I can hear the mountains talking to each other . And I saw you light up those pricks like Chinese New Year last night .
ANGRY: J , t takes them . Not me .
BLAZE: Does your grandfather understand English ?
NOMI: He understands . He just refuses to speak it .
BLAZE: Listen , I do n't want to be an ass-hole , ut can we just fast-forward the whole Yoda routine ?
LAFORTE: Give me the coin .
NOMI: The man you 're looking for goes by lots of names . Coyote , Black Dog . In Dakota , he 's Waka Sica . The Trickster . Look at him straight on , you might see a human . Look at him out of the corner of your eye at one of the in-between times dusk o dawn , you might see something else .
BLAZE: What does he want ?
LAFORTE: Wacokico . Vengeance .
BLAZE: Why ?
NOMI: Because it 's his nature .
BLAZE: I 've been looking for this man for five years now , storm-chasing Tracked him halfway across the country . How do I make him lift the curse ?
LAFORTE: Ta ocanzeke kin akta a'ikoyake . T ' e sniya kel rrrani . Takuni a'ikoyake sni ya'un kte hantana , wocanzeke kin ekignaka yo !
NOMI: My grandfather says you 've been looking in the wrong place . You need to look inward . The Ghost Rider is Starke 's weapon . An extension of his rage . But it ca n't ride people unless it has something to latch onto in the first place . You understand ?
LAFORTE: Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay ?
BLAZE: What ? What 'd he say ?
NOMI: He wants to know if you 're a bad man . If the Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you , would you burn ?
BLAZE: Why do n't you just go to the police ?
NOMI: I did . But I 'm red . They said they 'll `` look into it '' . Truth is , I 've had a few un-ins with them myself .
BLAZE: Your daughter why does Starke want her ?
NOMI: Because he 's her father . And he wants her back . Billy-Ray and the others , they 're being paid to take her to him .
BLAZE: Just so you understand what you 're asking , this thing inside me I ca n't control it . It just comes out . And when it does , it 's like I 'm a prisoner in my own body . There 's no reasoning with it . It does n't have a conscience . It does n't even have a personality . It 's just a
SEARCHING: hunger .
NOMI: You 're looking for Starke . I 'm looking for my kid . We find one , we 'll find the other .
BLAZE: And then ?
MAN: Is she comfortable ? Are you feeding he properly ?
FILTERED: She 's alright , I guess . Quiet .
MAN: Does she know where you 're taking her ?
VOICE: I think she 's figured it out .
MAN: And how does she feel about that ?
VOICE: How the hell should I know ?
CARRIGAN: I 'm not a psychologist . She 's a fucking freak , alright ? Always has been . Soone I get her out of my sight , the better .
MAN: She 's the most important thing in you life , Carrigan . Make sure she arrives safely .
BEAT: And be careful . She 'll kill if she gets the chance .
WEATHERMAN: experiencing extraordinary conditions . Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas , with reports of extensive damage and gusts of up to seventy miles per hour
PETROWSKY: Sorry , guy , I 'm just closing up .
STARKE: According to the hours posted outside , you 're still open .
EXASPERATED: Look , Mister , in case you had n't noticed , there 's a storm coming tornadoes , whatever . I 'm trying to get out of here . Starke fixes Petrowsky with a stern gaze .
STARKE: I would like to rent a car `` Jim '' .
RELENTING: Okay , alright , have a seat . Starke sits . Petrowsky moves behind his desk .
STARKE: Starke . First name , Ambrose .
PETROWSKY: Starke , okay . What kind of car were you looking for ?
STARKE: What about the Cadillac Deville ? I noticed you had one in your lot outside .
PETROWSKY: Sorry , already spoken for . How ` bout a full-size car ? I can give you a Chevy Malibu , Ford Taurus
STARKE: I had my heart set on the Cadillac , Jim .
ANNOYED NOW: Caddy 's taken . Now look , I 'm trying to e accommodating here , but I really am in a hurry . So what 's it going to be ?
STARKE: The Taurus , then .
PETROWSKY: Great . Can I see a driver 's license ?
STARKE: Two , three
PETROWSKY: Any other drivers ?
STARKE: No .
PETROWSKY: And you 'll be paying by ?
STARKE: Cash .
PETROWSKY: I 'll need a three hundred dollar deposit .
STARKE: I 'll do it myself .
PETROWSKY: Okey-dokey .
STARKE: Mrs. Petrowsky ?
PETROWSKY: Yeah .
STARKE: The price you quoted was $ 37,99 , the mid- size rate . But you 've listed the daily ate here as $ 62.99 .
PETROWSKY: I did ?
STARKE: Were you trying to cheat me , Jim ?
PETROWSKY: No , no , not at all
STARKE: Then I 'd like a new contract specifying the appropriate rate .
PETROWSKY: Look , ca n't we just go with the contract we 've got here ? I 'll make a note of it and knock a day 's rental off the total when you return it . What do you say ?
STARKE: I say the Devil 's in the details .
PETROWSKY: Jesus Jesus
HELEN: Jim ? ! Jim , what happened ? !
PETROWSKY: H-helen get aaway
ODELL: Want some food , kid ? Rain does n't respond . Odell rustles the bag .
CARRIGAN: She 's not gon na eat , Odell . Just shut up and get some sleep .
ODELL: I ca n't sleep . Every time I close my eyes , I see the face of that thing , Lloyd
BURNING: Christ .
CARRIGAN: Just put it out of your head .
ODELL: If I could put it out of my head , I would n't be awake now , would I ?
CARRIGAN: Look out there , what do you see ?
LANDSDALE: Dick .
CARRIGAN: That 's right . Miles and miles of nothing . And there 's a lot of weird shit unning around in that nothing . How many people you know seen a UFO , huh ? Ten ? Twenty ? Hell , it 's on every goddamn paper at the supermarket . You believe that shit , the whole country 's being overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers .
LANDSDALE: Probe you in the ass , they get the chance .
ODELL: What 's your point , Mr. Serling ?
CARRIGAN: My point is ; everybody 's seen somethina . Ghosts , aliens , Bigfoot , whatever
ODELL: This was n't no freaking Bigfoot ! You see what it did to Albright ? Punched his head clean off !
CARRIGAN: Look , I do n't know what that thing was . All I know is , Starke 's paying us a butt- load of money to deliver the kid to him . We were told we 'd see things and we were told to look the other way . You want to cut out ? I 'll pull over right here .
LANDSDALE: Keep your shirt on , B . We did n't come this far just to limp home with nothing . Right , Odell ? Odell settles back into his seat , uneasy .
ODELL: I guess . But I 'd still like to know what that thing was .
RAIN: He 's the Ghost Rider .
CHUCKLING: `` The Ghost Rider '' ? Get that off the back of an Oakridge Boys album or something ? You think that shit scares me ?
RAIN: It should . He 's going to kill you all .
FREAKING OUT: See ? SiE ? !
NOMI: I do n't like this . I spent the last six years trying to forget this place .
BLAZE: You got any idea where Billy-Ray might be headed ?
BLAZE: Then we should start with where he 's been .
NOMI: Billy-Ray dealt blackjack , poker . Worked the casino circuit . We met in Vegas . Things kind of went downhill after that .
RODENBURG: Sorry ' The Deal Man has n't been back in weeks . You have a nice day now .
NOMI: But you must 've talked to him . Do you know where he 's headed ? Just tell me that .
RODENBURG: What am I ? His babysitter ? I do n't know where he is , Nome , and if I did , I sure as hell would n't be telling you . Show these two ass-holes to the door .
BLAZE: Look , this is important . We 're talking about a kidnapping .
RODENBURG: We are ? And who is ?
BLAZE: I 'm just a friend .
RODENBURG: Ri h t. Nomi tell you what a blue ribbon slut she was ? Do anything to support that needle habit of hers . Truth , 'bout the only person that has n't had he around here is me . Blaze steps forward now , angry , threatening .
BLAZE: That 's enough .
RO DENBURG: What , you gon na get all Steven Segal on me , tough guy ? Pull a fucking Glimme Man ?
BLAZE: I need you to understand something , Vince . I am , by nature , an inherently violent man and there 's not much in the way of bad that I have n't already inflicted on this miserable world So unless the idea of learning to drive a wheelchair with your mouth sounds appealing , I suggest you apologize to my friend and tell us WHERE THE FUCK BILLY-
RODENBURG: I do n't know ! I do n't know Blaze gives Rodenburg 's thumb a savage twist .
BLAZE: And ?
RODENBURG: And I 'm sorry I 'm fucking sorry !
BLAZE: Think about it .
NOMI: Never thought I 'd be back here .
BLAZE: I think they 're gone .
NOMI: Listen , those things Vince said
BLAZE: You do n't have to explain yourself to me .
NOMI: Some of them are true .
BLAZE: Does n't make you a bad person .
NOMI: You can see the past ?
BLAZE: Just echoes , sometimes .
BEAT: Tell me about Starke . Nomi hesitates , not wanting to relive this .
NOMI: I was dying . I 'd shot myself full of Billy 's best gear . Figured I 'd teach him a lesson and go out in style .
WHISPERS: I do n't want to die .
BLAZE'S VOICE: `` You look like
BLAZE: you could use some help . '' Nomi nods , hugs herself .
NOMI: And I took it . What else was I going to do ? I do n't know what happened afte that . I 'm not sure I ever want to All I know is , nine months later , Rain was born .
BLAZE: Why send Billy-Ray after you ?
NOMI: Sick irony , I guess . Billy certainly knew all my haunts This was a mistake , Blaze . We 're not going to find anything here .
BLAZE: Guess again .
WHISPERING: Shit , they 've got us trapped here .
FATALISTIC: No . they 're the one who are rang d .
NOMI: What 're you ?
RODENBURG: Talked-to Billy-Ray , chief . Do n't know who you a r - e , but you picked the wrong
BLAZE: Please . Just tell us where they went and leave . There 's no reason why you have to die .
RODENBURG: I 'm gon na die ? Me ? Buddy , you got you head screwed on bass-ackwards !
BLAZE: I 'm sorry . soul , the fire expanding , engulfing Doyle .
RODENBURG: Doyle ?
WEINGROD: What 's going on , man ? Where 's Oswalt ?
PENNEBAKER: I want out of here , I 'm getting out !
RODENBURG: Keep your fucking voices down !
WEINGROD: He 's burning the house , man ! He 's
BEYOND TERRIFIED: North ! They 're headed North , into Oregon , oh , god , fuck
GHOST BLAZE: Where ?
RODENBURG: I do n't know exactly , Jesus , I do n't know !
NOMI: He told you everything he knew .
BEAT: you did n't have to do that .
BLAZE: You asked for my help . I warned you what you were getting into .
NOMI: I do n't I do n't know what else to do for you
BLAZE: S'okay just need to rest now
GASPING: wounds'11 be healed by morning .
NOMI: I thought you were dead .
BLAZE: I do n't even know if it 's that 's an option anymore . Every time I get close , I feel myself being dragged back it 's like being born all over again . Like every law in the universe is being oken .
NOMI: What if you 're innocent ?
BLAZE: Nobody 's innocent . Think about it . Everyone 's done somethincr . You . Me
SHAKING: There 's always some sad motherfucker out there that needs retribution , vengeance
NOMI: Here , why do n't you lie down for a little while ?
BLAZE: What are you doing ?
NOMI: I 'm sorry , I just
BLAZE: What time is it ?
NOMI: A little after three .
BLAZE: What time , exactly ?
NOMI: 3 27 . Why ?
BLAZE: They 're just a kind of record . Let 's go .
NOMI: You made a deal . Blaze nods .
BLAZE: Roxanne ? Yeah , she 's alive . She just does n't know it . Coma . Probably never wake up .
NOMI: So he tricked you .
BLAZE: That 's what he does , does n't he ? She nods . That 's what he does .
NOMI: What about the baby ? Blaze just shakes his head .
BLAZE: It 's funny . That kid was supposed to be my second chance . Rox and I used to talk about it how things 'd be different after she was born . Nomi did n't expect his honest vulnerability .
NOMI: Maybe that 's why we have them
BLAZE: What , kids ?
NODDING: So we can make amends for all the royal fuck-ups we 've perpetrated on the world . God knows I 've had my share . I just do n't want her to have to pay fo the things I 've done . You know ?
BLAZE: Make him pay , somehow
UNCERTAIN: I do n't know . How do you beat the Devil ? Walk up and bitch-slap him ? Pretend you 're Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka up his hind ass ? I 'm basically making this up as I go along . Nomi smiles .
NOMI: I 'm sure you 'll figure something out .
CARRIGAN: Yeah ?
ODELL: No fucking way Carrigan ponders , nods to Landsdale .
CARRIGAN: We 're going to need reinforcements , some kind of escort to the meet .
LANDSDALE: I know a guy . Got some boys given ove to wickedness and such .
CARRIGAN: Make the call .
CARRIGAN: Hey , kiddo , you 're worrying my boy here . So shut your goddamn mouth
RAIN: You ca n't tell me what to do . You 're not my father .
CARRIGAN: You better believe that , sweetheart . I 'm just the dumb-ass that financed you whole fucking life . You and your mothe oth . And what did I get for that selfless act of stupidity ? She burned down the house and gave me something to emember her by .
LANDSDALE: Believe me , I could care less what Starke wants with you . Make you into a fucking hood ornament if he wants to . It 's not like you came springing out of my loins . Only thing I care about now is getting what 's mine , and that 's
RAIN'S EYES: are fluttering . Extreme concentration .
THE PEN: levitates , tilts into her outstretched hands .
ODELL: Man , she shot you ? Jesus . Lucky she did n't perforate my allsack with that fucking pen .
ODELL: Mounts are cracked , trans-axle 's shot to
HELL: this baby ai n't goin ' nowhere .
CARRIGAN: Fuck . Ma .
LANDSDALE: How ` bout up there ?
CARRIGAN: Where the fuck are those men of yours ?
LANDSDALE: Do n't worry . They 're on their way . Carrigan nods , cuts his cards . He j worried .
BLAZE: She 's alive .
NOMI: How do you know - ?
BLAZE: No . We 'll wait .
NOMI: You wait . I 'm heading in .
BLAZE: Look , they 're not going anywhere .
NOMI: You do n't know that . This is probably the best chance we 'll get . They 're sitting ducks . We can do this if you
BLAZE: If I what ? Burn them alive ? Eat thei spirits ?
NOMI: They know we 're coming , do n't they ?
ARLO: Brotherman .
LANDSDALE: Arlo .
GRINNING: I believe you know the Pulsifer Brothers , Chester and Gunt ?
BLAZE: I 'll find her . You stay here .
NOMI: I know . I 'm on my own . , Just bring her back to me . That 's all I care about .
NODDING: Start disabling the bikes . Last thing we need is a gang of pissed-off speed freaks on our tail . Rip out all the coil wires -
CHAGRINED: or you could do that . As Blaze creeps away
BLAZE: Whatever happens
ARLO: So you need some contract work ?
CARRIGAN: An escort . We 're making a delivery first thing tomorrow morning .
ARLO: And will there be mayhem involved ?
CARRIGAN: Yeah , I 'd say a certain amount of hijinx are likely to ensue .
ARLO: Well , I 'll tell you , I got nineteen others out there willing to go the distance and enough firepower to give a small Balkan nation a fucking titty- twister . But we do n't come cheap . So how many men we going up against ?
CARRIGAN: One .
ARLO: One man ?
CARRIGAN: One man .
ARLO: You trying to diddle my nutpurse , Mister ?
CARRIGAN: Absolutely not . Lem me clarify things
ARLO: Brotherman , what in fuck 's name is this smooth faggot talking about ?
BLAZE'S POV;: The room , the men but no Rain .
LANDS DALE: He 's telling the truth , Arlo . The guy ai n't human . Saw him torch Albright and Chudacoff with my own eyes .
GUNT: Well , I say bring him on . You see this ink ? That 's a hundred hours under the needle . A motherfucking canvas of pain . He and Chester here , we 're not afraid of fuck-diddly !
ARLO: If this guy 's as lethal as you say he is , I want fifty for me , another fifty for the club . Only you ca n't let the boys know we 're takin ' a 50K rake off the top , see ?
CARRIGAN: How ` bout sixty and I 'll throw in a kilo of coke ?
INCREDULOUS: Coke ? That 's like selling snow to Eskimos . You think I 'm some kind of crack-smoking foolio or something ?
SIGHING: Seventy , then .
ARLO: Ninety , and not a nickel less , you fucking pillow-biter .
CARRIGAN: E a sy , gentlemen . No need to get all truculent on me .
ARLO: Truculent ? You get that out of a Scrabble dictionary or something ? What the fuck does `` truculent '' mean ? I 'll tell you what it means . It means
CARRIGAN: Okay , alright how about seventy-five and we 'll smoke the old peace pipe ?
ARLO: How ` bout eighty or you 're gon na be smoking my dick ?
BLAZE: Shit .
ARLO: What is that ?
LISTENING: Sounds like a smoke alarm .
GLINT: Smells like somethin 's burning .
CARRIGAN: What-is this , fucking charades ? ! It 's h , jM , you- ass-holes !
CHESTER: Forget it , bro , live to fight another day .
GUNT: No fucking way ! That 's my hog !
CHESTER: Gunt !
RAIN: What about the Ghost Rider ? We have to go back for him !
NOMI: Are you crazy ? ! Sit down !
RAIN: No , no , no
BLAZE: Give me your gun !
ON CARRIGAN,: hauling the Mack alongside Chester
CARRIGAN: The hell you doing ? I need the kid alive ! ! !
CHESTER: Fuck the kid and FUCK YOU ! ! !
NOMI: Do something ! ! !
BLAZE: I have to talk to the warden . You have to put me someplace else
DEPUTY #1: Should 've thought of that before you pulled that `` Dukes of Hazzard '' stunt .
BLAZE: Please , just listen to me . Put me in solitary , anywhere but here .
DEPUTY #2: This is n't a fucking hotel , chief .
BLAZE: You do n't understand , people will die
DEPUTY: Easy on the threats , big guy
BLAZE: Do not put me in here ! Do not leave me with these men ! They 'll die if you do this ! ! !
RAIN: Are we safe now ?
NOMI: Honey , I do n't know if we 'll ever be safe .
RAIN: He talks to me sometimes .
NOMI: Who ?
RAIN: My father when I 'm dreaming .
FEARFUL: What does he say ?
RAIN: I do n't want to be like him , mom .
NOMI: You wo n't .
SOBBING: You do n't know that .
NOMI: Yes , I do , baby
RAIN: Mom ? !
NOMI: Sweety , you have to get out of here now .
NOMI: Honey , go , GO ! ?
CARRI GAN: you did n't tell us what he was
STARKE: If I could save you , would you be willing to make a deal ?
BLAZE: How ?
RAIN: My father found us , just like she knew he would .
BLAZE: I do n't know .
INSISTENT: But what do you think ?
BLAZE: Yeah , I think there 's something . Maybe not angels playing harps and stuff , but
SEARCHING: something .
RAIN: He 'll keep coming , you know . Unless you stop him .
TIRED: I do n't know that I can anymore .
RAIN: But you 'll try , right ?
BLAZE: I do n't have anything left to give , kid . Blaze stands , starts walking . Rain follows .
RAIN: My mother said you were a good man .
BLAZE: I 'm not .
RAIN: She said I could trust you .
BLAZE: You ca n't .
PERSISTENT: But do n't you think there 's a reason why all of this is happening ? Like fate ?
BLAZE: I do n't believe in fate .
RAIN: Maybe it believes in you .
RAIN: We 're going to a church ?
BLAZE: It 's not a church . It 's a mission . They take people in .
RAIN: Are you going to dump me there ?
TOLBEIN: Can I help you ?
BLAZE: Our car broke down a few miles back and my daughter and I were wondering if we could crash here for the night .
TOLBEIN: Do n't think so .
BLAZE: What about a ride , then ? Is there a town somewhere you could take us to ?
NUNEZ: Why do n't you head back to Dawson ? They got motels there .
BLAZE: That 's not really an option .
TOLBEIN: Then I 'd say you 're out of luck .
BLAZE: Look , you must have a cot , something . The kid 's hungry
RHYMER: Rain ? That 's a pretty name .
TO RAIN: You hungry , Rain ? Would you like something to eat ?
TOLBEIN: Bottom line , Father . There 's something wrong with those two . Especially the kid .
RHYMER: Duly noted , Richard .
BLAZE: Those men outside
RHYMER: Most of them are on a work-release program . We 're a halfway house for ex- offenders . We try to get people on thei feet , reintegrate them into society . Blaze glances at Rain , apprehensive .
RHYMER: It 's turned out beautiful , has n't it ? We try to be as self sufficient as we can , ack to the earth and all that .
BLAZE: I know my way around a flywheel housing .
RHYMER: Well I 've got a generator out back that 's een on life support the last few weeks . Mind helping me try to resuscitate it ? Blaze looks at him curiously .
BLAZE: Sure .
RHYMER: So how long have you been running ?
BLAZE: What do you mean ?
RHYMER: You know what I mean . You spend as much time around lost souls as I have , you learn how to read a man 's face .
NODDING: You want to hand me that crescent wrench ?
BLAZE: No .
RHYMER: So what happened to her mother ?
BLAZE: She 's dead .
RHYMER: Did you kill her ?
BLAZE: No .
ELABORATING: She does n't have anyone else . I 'm just trying to protect her .
RHYMER: And who 's protecting you ?
MOMENTS LATER,: Blaze and Rhymer are cleaning up .
BLAZE: Listen , I appreciate what you 're trying to do , but I 've never really been a come to Jesus kind of guy .
RHYMER: I was n't talking about Jesus , I was talking about a little healthy introspection . Working here , staying in one place for a while , seeing what surfaces . I 've found that people tend to arrive on our doorstep for a reason .
BLAZE: I ca n't stay . I 'm sorry .
RHYMER: What about the girl , then ? Whateve you 're involved in , I ca n't imagine it 's good for her well-being . We can find a home for her .
UNSURE: I 'd have to leave tonight
RHYMER: You can take the Norton .
BLAZE: I do n't have any money .
RHYMER: So send us some when you do .
NOMI'S VOICE: He wants to know if you 're a bad man . He wants to know if the Ghost Ride turned its penance stare on you , would you burn ?
RHYMER: That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life . ''
RHYMER: `` That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly ou fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ . And these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full . This then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light ``
NUNEZ: Padre . You 'd better take a look at this .
TOLBEIN: It 's her she 's the one doing this .
RHYMER: That 's enough , Richard .
TOLBEIN: I 'm telling you , Father , there 's something wrong with
RHYMER: Get away from the windows !
TO WILSON: Wilson , take Rain to the chapel .
WILSON: I ai n't going nowhere with her .
RHYMER: One of you , please , just take the kid to the chapel .
TOLBEIN: Father , that 's the last place she should e .
NUNEZ: Quiet , Viscott !
TOLBEIN: I knEw we should 've sent them away !
TOLBEIN: She 's the one they want , I 'm telling you !
TOLBEIN: I told you
NUNEZ: What the fuck ? !
TOLBEIN: Do what he says ! Put her out !
RHYMER: Get back with the others !
TOLBEIN: We do n't do what it says , that thing outside there 's gon na kill us all .
RHYMER: God as my witness , Richard , lay a hand on that girl and I will pull this trigger .
TOLBEIN: Open the fucking door ! DO IT !
BLAZE'S POV: Distant thunderheads . LIGHTNING flickering .
RAIN: Shoot the gas !
RHYMER: What ?
TOLBEIN: There 's no way down from here !
RAIN: huddled beneath a flimsy bed-frame .
RAIN: Are you going to die ?
WEAKLY: Not today .
CARRIGAN: who the fuck are you , anyway ?
GHOST BLAZE: Vengeance .
CARRIGAN: Do it , fucker dQ it .
STARKE: Looks like we 've come to the end of the oad , have n't we ?
BLAZE: Guess so . After a long beat
STARKE: Give me the girl and I 'll lift the curse .
BLAZE: She 's all yours , Starke
STARKE: Do n't be a fool , Blaze . I 'm offering you your life back .
BLAZE: That 's not a life . And least now one I 'm interested in living .
STARKE: You think you can control it . You ca n't .
BLAZE: Guess I 'm willing to take my chances .
STARKE: You have your mother 's eyes . and walks away .
RAIN: He 'll be back .
BLAZE: Yeah .
EPPS: It 's a slow leak . She unclips and drops to the deck .
GREER: What 's slow ?
EPPS: Maybe twenty gallons an hour .
DODGE: Where from ?
EPPS: Amidships starboard at the beam . Just under the waterline . I do n't think it 's a problem .
GREER: Hear that , Dodge ? Epps do n't think it 's a problem .
DODGE: I 'll sleep good tonight knowing that .
MURPHY: Go .
GREER: The number nine on the starboard side 's half flooded . Epps says it 's a slow leak just under the waterline , about twenty gallons an hour . They must 've pumped it before we left Sitka .
MURPHY: Of course they did .
GREER: Let the buyer beware .
MURPHY: What do you say , Dodge ?
VASILI: I thought you say Tuesday .
MURPHY: Better late than never .
VASILI: What 's this ?
MURPHY: You got a leak in the number nine compartment .
VASILI: No , no . You got leak .
MURPHY: You pump it out and re-seam the hull , she 'll be good as new .
VASILI: That cost me twenty grand at least .
MURPHY: Fifteen , at the most .
VASILI: Twenty . You knock off twenty and then we see . After my guy looks at it .
MURPHY: You 're kidding , right ?
VASILI: You want fair pay , make hamburge for Mickey D. Otherwise , please to sign .
GREER: Not bad for dragging a leaky tu half way to Russia .
MURPHY: He 'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid .
GREER: I must be in the wrong business .
MURPHY: You got that right .
GREER: Better than `` making hamburger fo Mickey D . ''
DODGE: Much obliged , skipper .
GREER: Looks like Epps ' gon na get some tonight .
DODGE: With that coxswain dickhead .
MURPHY: You are n't jealous , are you Dodge ?
DODGE: Are you kidding me ? Jealous ? Epps ? Gim me a break .
GIRLFRIEND: You want to mess with me , I 'll kick your bitch ass , girl .
EPPS: I do n't know what you 're talking about . I just bought this guy a beer .
GIRLFRIEND: This `` guy '' is my man , honey .
COASTGUARDSMAN: Darlene
GIRLFRIEND: You , shut up .
EPPS: Listen , I do n't want any trouble , okay ?
GIRLFRIEND: Uh-uh . No . We 're gon na fix this right now .
MURPHY: What seems to be the trouble , ladies ?
RIVETER: Why n't you mind your own business , chief .
MURPHY: As I said , what seems to be the trouble ?
RIVETER: Did n't you hear me , grandpa ? Or you got your hearing aid turned down ?
MURPHY: I heard you . But I 'm choosing to ignore you . Epps , let 's go .
RIVETER: These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you 're interrupting it .
MURPHY: You got about two seconds to get your paws off me , Tarzan .
RIVETER: Or what ?
MURPHY: Epps ?
COASTGUARDSMAN: Wait .
EPPS: Morning everybody .
GREER: Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night , did you Epps ?
EPPS: Showed him a hell of a lot more than that .
GREER: I bet you did .
MURPHY: Candy ?
EPPS: It 's my pen name .
GREER: Red sky at night , sailor 's delight .
MURPHY: Red sky in morning , sailor take warning .
DODGE: Fuck it .
EPPS: One more ?
DODGE: Why not . She gathers the cards , shuffles .
EPPS: What ?
DODGE: It just occurred to me I do n't know your first name . All this time and I do n't know it . She deals the cards in silence .
EPPS: Maureen .
DODGE: What ?
EPPS: Maureen .
DODGE: Maureen ?
EPPS: What 's yours ?
DODGE: Roger .
EPPS: Roger ?
DODGE: Yeah .
EPPS: No .
GREER: Greer to Murphy . Greer studies the radar display as he waits .
MURPHY: Alright . I 'll be right up .
GREER: Looks like it 's adrift .
EPPS: Could be a fishing boat .
GREER: Too big . More like a freighter .
MURPHY: What the hell would a freighter be doing up here ? It 's way out of the lanes . There 's not a port for 800 miles .
DODGE: Smugglers maybe .
GREER: Smuggling what ? Tundra grass ?
MURPHY: Merchant vessel at position one seven four one five west , five seven seven five north , this is tugboat Arctic Warrior . Do you copy ? Over .
GREER: Call the Coastguard ?
MURPHY: Steer to one eight five . Let 's check her out .
GREER: Talk to me , skipper .
MURPHY: We 're in a stairwell just under the main superstructure .
GREER: How 's that ?
MURPHY: Besides a little rust , everything 's pretty well-preserved . Greer and Dodge look at each other .
GREER: What is it ? No answer .
MURPHY: Sorry . Another beat in silence .
GREER: What is it ?
MURPHY: It 's a passenger ship . It 's a damn passenger ship .
DODGE: Probably slipped her moorings , got tangled up in a current .
EPPS: Out here ? What , so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to ump into her until now ?
DODGE: Somebody 's probably looking for he as we speak .
MURPHY: Whatever the reason , she 's adrift and abandoned . We 've got every right to salvage her .
GREER: You mean tow her back ? That 's a thirty thousand ton ship you 're talking about .
MURPHY: We 've done it before .
DODGE: Yeah , from one side of the harbor to the other . But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over .
MURPHY: You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage ? The fittings alone could go for a few million .
DODGE: If you get it back in one piece .
MURPHY: It 's a risk I 'm willing to take .
GREER: All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it .
MURPHY: So we cut her loose and wait it out . A little weather could n't be anything she has n't seen before .
DODGE: It 's a bloody navigation hazard . One boat ca n't control a ship that size .
MURPHY: The damn thing 's been floating around for God knows how long and it has n't hit anything yet . So we take it easy . A little of the old push pull . A long beat as they hold there .
EPPS: Go on .
MURPHY: Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million ucks . At least . Who knows , could be more . Could be a lot more . What I 'm proposing is we split it four ways . A beat . Dodge looks to Epps and Greer .
DODGE: Okay . We 're gon na use a heavier than usual twin cable rig this time , consisting of a pair of number three gauge braided wire tows . We 'll tie off through the ancho alleys . And come down to the aft port and starboard pins . Here . Thus , we need to get two of these Up there . He indicates the bow of the Chimera .
EPPS: Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow .
DODGE: Then we 'll all be doomed . Any othe questions ?
DODGE: Ready ?
EPPS: Bring it on , dude .
DODGE: Yes !
MURPHY: With a little extra fuel , weathe permitting , we should make Sitka in five days without another stop .
DODGE: Sounds reasonable .
GREER: Hypothetically speaking , what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back ?
DODGE: They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away .
GREER: I do n't care what , ai n't nobody just gon na let us walk away with a ship that size .
MURPHY: The law 's on our side . If they want to challenge it , let them try .
EPPS: They must 've scuttled it . Nobody just lets a ship float away .
DODGE: Nobody just scuttles a passenge liner either .
EPPS: Ever heard of insurance , big boy ?
MURPHY: Either way , we found it . It 's ours now .
DODGE: What the
MURPHY: What is it ?
DODGE: Threw a turbine blade .
MURPHY: How long to fix ?
DODGE: Hard to say . I got ta get in there and have a look . At least a couple days . Depending .
GREER: You think the extra strain caused it ?
DODGE: Nah . Everything was cool . It 's just one of those things .
MURPHY: Some classy tub in it 's day , huh ?
GREER: Yeah .
EPPS: Everything 's still here . Ticket ecords , receipts , books of account . Greer picks one up .
GREER: One first class passage . Elizabeth James . Dubayy to Halifax . January 29th 1953 . Murphy takes it , looking it over .
MURPHY: Chimera . Flag ship of the Dobbins Kirk Line . Nova Scotia .
GREER: That must be the old man right there .
EPPS: Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass .
GREER: He 'd let you off at the nearest port , that 's for sure .
DODGE: How about now ?
GREER: Sixty pounds .
DODGE: What ? You sure ?
GREER: That 's what it says .
DODGE: Lem me see .
EPPS: Coffee ?
MURPHY: Yeah . Thanks .
EPPS: What 'd you find up there ?
MURPHY: Some charts . A crew manifest . Looks like her last voyage was January 1953 . The question is where the hell 's she been since .
EPPS: She was sailing up north , right ?
MURPHY: Her destination was Halifax , yeah .
EPPS: Well , suppose she got a little furthe north than she should have . Got stuck in the ice . The passengers and crew evacuated . She froze into the ice pack , which moved further north , where it froze in solid . They write it off . Fifty years later , the whole global warming thing happens . The ice melts , she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her . Murphy nods , considering it .
MURPHY: As reasonable an explanation as any , I guess .
EPPS: Nope .
MURPHY: She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872 . One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel , the Dei Gratia . As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer , they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste . On boarding , they found her completely deserted . The captain , his wife , their daughter , and the entire crew , all gone . The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble . The table was even set fo dinner . And in the nine days afte the last entry , she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard .
EPPS: So what did happen ?
MURPHY: Nobody knows . There 've been a lot of theories , of course . But we 'll neve eally know for sure .
EPPS: You think she 's sailing without a crew ? Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow .
MURPHY: I think we 'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current .
EPPS: You 're more practical than superstitious .
MURPHY: Only way to be .
DODGE: Turbine rotor 's shot .
MURPHY: I thought you said it was just a lade .
DODGE: Metal 's crystallized . Got ta replace the whole deal .
MURPHY: How much longer 's that gon na take ?
DODGE: Like I always say
MURPHY: I know I know , two ways to do anything
DODGE: The right way and the wrong way .
MURPHY: But how long ?
DODGE: Hard to say .
MURPHY: We got ta get outa here , Dodge . A storm blows up and we 're history .
DODGE: I 'm telling you , you do n't want to e running that fan like it is .
MURPHY: What about running number two by itself ?
DODGE: It 's a full 2500 horses down . We could n't drag that boat down hill on ice with it .
MURPHY: How long , then ?
DODGE: I got ta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor .
MURPHY: How long ?
DODGE: Three , four days .
MURPHY: Goddamit , Dodge .
DODGE: What do you want me to tell you , that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened ? Ca n't do it , skipper .
MURPHY: North Island , North Island , North Island . This is tugboat Arctic Warrior . Over .
DODGE: Man , it gives me the creeps . We got no business towing a ship that size anyway . I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway .
GREER: Are you crazy ? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship ? We own a ship , Dodge .
DODGE: Yeah , a ship that 's supposed to have een lost at sea fifty years ago . You do n't think that 's just a little freaky ?
EPPS: If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago , we just hit the jackpot .
DODGE: Yeah , well how the hell you get something like that wrong ? That 's a damn big boat . It 's either sunk o it ai n't .
MURPHY: We all want to get outa here , Dodge . Especially me . With that boat in tow . You got three days . Make the most of it .
DODGE: Fucker !
GREER: Take it easy , Dodge . It 's only a piece of metal .
DODGE: Damn mind of it 's own .
GREER: Morning , skipper . Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight .
MURPHY: Morning .
GREER: You 're up late .
MURPHY: Guess I must 've fallen back to sleep . Where 's Epps ?
DODGE: Went aboard .
MURPHY: She take a radio ?
GREER: Yeah . Murphy nods . A beat .
MURPHY: Hard to say . Maybe forty , fifty million .
GREER: Ho , baby !
EPPS: That 's a lot of money for somebody to just let float away . Murphy looks up at her from the gold .
MURPHY: Yes , it is . A beat as they all hold there .
DODGE: What , you think there 's something funny about it ?
MURPHY: A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard , adrift ? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking fo it ?
GREER: If they thought it was lost at sea , they probably just wrote it off .
MURPHY: Not for fifty million . An ocean line maybe . But fifty million in gold , they come looking for .
EPPS: Maybe they did n't want it back . Maybe the whole fat deal was insured .
MURPHY: Maybe . But there 's always somebody whose interest 's at stake .
GREER: All I got ta say is it looks like that somebody 's us right now . Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge .
EPPS: And it looks like somebody got here efore us too .
DODGE: Did n't happen yesterday , I 'll tell you that . Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat .
MURPHY: Then it happened before they scuttled her .
EPPS: You mean , before she sank .
GREER: Cargo like this could make a crew think twice .
MURPHY: That it could . A beat , as they all look on at the gold .
GREER: Then why did n't they take it .
EPPS: Probably did n't have time .
DODGE: Or somebody stopped them .
MURPHY: Either way , they must 've had a pretty good reason .
GREER: Must be a damn good reason to jump ship and leave fifty million dollars aboard . A beat as they consider it .
DODGE: So what 're we gon na do . That 's the ig question , right ?
MURPHY: A salvage claim to a vessel 's cargo 's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself . It 's ours .
DODGE: Then we 're rich . We 're damn , filthy stinking rich .
MURPHY: It looks like it . A beat as they let this sink in .
GREER: So what ? We gon na unload the gold and get a move on ?
MURPHY: We leave it where it is . Stick to the plan .
DODGE: You got ta be kidding ? What the hell we need that tub for , we got fifty million bucks ?
MURPHY: So we get a little more for the boat . Besides , the gold 'll be safer where it is .
GREER: Yeah , but we still got ta haul that ig piece of shit all the way back to Sitka .
MURPHY: It 's worth the effort . Believe me . Besides we 're gon na need her to prove the salvage .
EPPS: Why not call for help ?
MURPHY: For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this .
DODGE: Last thing we want is extra partners .
EPPS: Or uninvited guests .
GREER: I heard that .
MURPHY: Dodge , you got ta get on those repairs .
DODGE: Yeah , yeah . I 'm on it .
MURPHY: The sooner we get under way , the sooner we are to spending what 's ours .
GREER: Two hundred twenty . Two twenty one . Two twenty two . Greer makes a note .
EPPS: That 's what I call a payday .
GREER: Hell yeah . They slap hands .
DODGE: Murphy !
GREER: Looks like it took out the backup genny too .
MURPHY: Terrific . Epps arrives with a first aid kit .
DODGE: Seen better Ow ! Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide .
EPPS: This 's gon na hurt a little .
DODGE: Thanks for the warning Ow ! Damn ! Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it .
GREER: What now ?
MURPHY: We could call for help .
GREER: And get a bunch of fools sniffin ' around here ?
EPPS: What other choices have we got ?
DODGE: I tell you one thing , we 're not gon na e towing no ship now .
MURPHY: United States Coastguard , this is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two . Radio check . Over . A moment , then
GREER: Fifty million four ways . That 's twelve million and change a piece . What you gon na do with your share , skipper ?
MURPHY: Not much at all , I guess . Retire . Live out my golden years and all that .
DODGE: I 'm buyin ' me a nice outrigger . Spend my time hauling rich Seattle usiness men through the Puget .
MURPHY: How about you Epps ?
EPPS: Guess I 'll just keep working .
DODGE: What 're you crazy ?
EPPS: I like my job .
MURPHY: Greer ?
GREER: Moving to Sweden .
DODGE: What 's so great about Sweden ?
GREER: It 's a beautiful country . Very clean . Very civilized . And cold .
EPPS: That 's a good thing ?
GREER: Hell , yeah . I like it cold . Colde the better .
DODGE: Yeah , but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gon na dream about .
GREER: We 'll see who 's dreamin ' , m'man .
MURPHY: Dreamin 's all any of you 're gon na be doing if we do n't get this boat unning .
DODGE: Yeah , yeah .
GREER: What the hell is that ?
EPPS: It 's coming from inside .
DODGE: Sounds like the hull .
MURPHY: Warm water current maybe , making the metal expand .
GREER: That shit is seriously bizarre .
EPPS: Hey !
MURPHY: Take it easy , you 'll live longer .
EPPS: Did you see him ?
MURPHY: Who ?
EPPS: The guy . He just came this way .
MURPHY: What guy ?
EPPS: There 's somebody else on this boat .
MURPHY: What ? What the hell 're you talking about .
EPPS: I saw him . Just a minute ago . Some guy .
MURPHY: Are you sure ?
EPPS: Of course I 'm sure . I saw him .
MURPHY: You sure it was n't me ?
EPPS: It was n't you . It was somebody else . There 's somebody else aboard . A beat as Murphy looks back at her .
DODGE: Light in those passages ai n't so good .
EPPS: I 'm telling you , I saw somebody . I do n't know who it was . But I saw somebody .
GREER: What 'd he look like ?
EPPS: Maybe six feet . Lanky . I did n't get a good look . He was far away . But I saw him . I saw him as sure as you 're standing there .
DODGE: Where 's his boat , then ? Where 's his crew ? He ai n't gon na be out here by himself , that 's for damn sure .
GREER: She 's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we 'd never know it .
EPPS: Maybe that is his boat .
DODGE: Gim me a break . A beat as they sit in silence .
MURPHY: If somebody 's aboard her already , she ai n't ours . She 's theirs .
DODGE: Bullshit . That boat has n't made steam for fifty years . We found her . She 's ours .
MURPHY: Not in the eyes of the law .
EPPS: So , we find this guy and make a deal with him .
MURPHY: We do n't exactly have the best argaining position .
DODGE: I say fuck the motherfucker . We 're a professional salvage crew going about our business . What 's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway ?
MURPHY: And what do you propose ? That we knock this guy off ?
DODGE: Why not ? Why the fuck not ?
EPPS: So we kill him ?
DODGE: I 'm saying we got ta do whatever we got ta do to preserve our interest .
GREER: I do n't know .
MURPHY: Let 's just take it easy here , alright ? Nobody 's gon na kill anybody .
GREER: Supposing he wants to get bad with us ?
DODGE: One guy is n't gon na be so stupid .
EPPS: Maybe he is n't alone . They consider this a moment .
GREER: I say we off-load some of that gold now .
MURPHY: Would you hold on just a minute here , please ? Look , there 's no reason to panic now . Epps saw somebody . Fine . It 's a big boat . Chances 're real good he does n't even know about the gold . If we stay cool , nobody 'll be the wiser . The gold stays where it is til we 're eady to go . Like I said , it 'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here .
DODGE: What if that fucker finds it before we 're ready to go ?
MURPHY: We 'll stand a watch . Four on , eight off . Low man first .
EPPS: Guess that 'd be me . Again .
MURPHY: Dodge , get on that turbine . I do n't care if you do n't sleep for a week . The sooner you 're done , the soone we can get out of here . How 's the food situation ?
GREER: Pretty low all around .
MURPHY: We 'll have to take it easy then . I do n't think we 'll find much aboard the ship , but it 's probably worth looking around .
EPPS: Say we run into this guy again . A beat as they consider this .
MURPHY: If he 's reasonable , maybe we can make some kind of deal . If not . We 'll have to re-consider our options .
DODGE: Yeah , reconsider fucking his shit up .
EPPS: Seen a lota movies .
MURPHY: No cowboy shit up there , understand ?
EPPS: No cowboy shit . Right . Greer extends a thermos to Epps .
GREER: Coffee .
EPPS: You 're a pal .
MURPHY: Got your light ?
EPPS: Yup .
DODGE: Smokes ?
EPPS: Oh yeah .
MURPHY: Murphy to Epps . She settles back , exhausted .
EPPS: Epps .
MURPHY: You just shoot at something ?
EPPS: Yeah . Just a bird . Just a stupid ird .
MURPHY: Bodies 're too fresh .
DODGE: Fresh ai n't the first word that comes to mind .
MURPHY: Greek citizen . Merchant navy . Obviously we are n't the first to come across this ship . They probably stumbled across it just like we did .
GREER: And look what happened .
DODGE: Damn barbaric is what it is .
MURPHY: Could be meant as a warning .
GREER: Stay away . Or else .
EPPS: Because of the gold .
MURPHY: That 'd be my guess .
DODGE: So whoever did this might still be around .
GREER: Maybe Epps 's mystery man had something to do with it .
MURPHY: Maybe .
EPPS: So , what ? We report this ? Call the Coastguard ? Another beat as they hold there .
DODGE: Let 's not be too hasty .
GREER: Yeah . Hell , what difference does it make if we report it now or later ? We call this in now , gon na be Coastguard , FBI , who knows who , all over the place . A beat as nobody 's too sure about this .
MURPHY: Dodge , if this is n't incentive enough to fix that boat , I do n't know what is .
DODGE: All the seals and gaskets 're shot . Anything that was rubber burned up . Murphy stands at the doorway , looking on .
MURPHY: Ca n't you use something else ?
DODGE: I might be able to find something on the ship . But it 's gon na take time .
MURPHY: Do what you need to do . Just do it fast .
DODGE: Right .
GREER: I ai n't no mechanic , just so you know .
DODGE: You find anything that even looks like a compressor . I do n't care what , grab it .
GREER: Dammit !
MURPHY: Captain relieved of command .
MURPHY: This is Murphy . Anybody trying to call me ? Over .
VOICE: Penny whistle toy . Penny whistle toy . Penny whistle toy . Penny whistle toy .
MURPHY: Greer ! Dodge !
DODGE: Dodge to Murphy .
MURPHY: Murphy .
DODGE: You better get down here quick , skipper . I 'm on `` C '' deck . Cabin 400 .
MURPHY: What is it ?
DODGE: I think you better see this fo yourself .
GREER: Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska getofedobrodijotosiantosg .
EPPS: I 'm no doctor . But I 'd say he 's in a coma .
DODGE: A what ?
EPPS: I do n't know what else you 'd call it . He 's breathing on his own , but his pupils are completely blown out . He 's totally unresponsive to pain . What happened up there ?
DODGE: I heard a scream . When I got there I found him on the floor . He was having some kind of seizure . I did n't see anybody else .
MURPHY: He must 've seen something . A beat as they consider this .
EPPS: Other than the obvious , there 's nothing wrong with him that I can see , not on the outside .
DODGE: Then what the hell happened to him ? Another beat as they hold there .
MURPHY: Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio .
EPPS: Greer ?
MURPHY: I do n't know . No . Not Greer . Somebody . Another long beat as they think about this .
DODGE: Not me . Another beat as this sinks in .
EPPS: He needs a doctor .
MURPHY: I 'll call us in . Dodge , see how many signal flares you can scrounge up . Keep an eye on him .
EPPS: Same . Any luck ?
MURPHY: No . I 'll try again later . A beat as they look on at Greer .
EPPS: They 're dead in the water that morning . Four hours later the captain 's relieved of his command . And that evening they issue a general
MURPHY: Possibly false . Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea . I do n't think mutiny 's out of the question here .
DODGE: On a passenger ship in 1953 ?
MURPHY: If they knew what they were carrying .
EPPS: You 're saying they mutinied for the gold ?
MURPHY: If they were close enough to shore , they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats .
EPPS: Only something must 've gone wrong .
DODGE: Yeah , way wrong . A beat as they consider it .
MURPHY: How do you mean ?
DODGE: Well , they 're gon na be asking a lot of questions . About us . About those odies . About the gold . Seems like we oughta be prepared is all .
MURPHY: I guess the best strategy 's just to tell them the truth .
DODGE: Yeah , well . The truth is one thing . When there 's more than a few hundred million dollars involved , that 's a whole new deal .
MURPHY: What do you propose ?
DODGE: For starters , getting that gold off the ship . What they do n't know about is n't gon na bother them . A beat as Murphy holds there .
MURPHY: There 's no way we 're gon na hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here . Besides , it 'll be safer where it is .
DODGE: With all due respect , skipper . Part of that up there 's mine . I 'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it . A beat as Murphy looks on .
MURPHY: Tell you what , Dodge . Once we get ack to shore , you can do whateve you want with your share . But until then , the gold stays right where it is .
DODGE: I do n't know what you 're talking about ?
MURPHY: I think you know .
DODGE: Maybe you can tell me then . Murphy shoves him hard into the wall .
MURPHY: The radio !
DODGE: The radio . Oh , yeah , the radio . Murphy tightens his grip .
MURPHY: You smashed it !
DODGE: What ? !
MURPHY: Do n't lie to me !
DODGE: What the fuck ?
MURPHY: You did n't want us calling anybody . Too liable to ruin your big payday .
DODGE: I did n't touch the fucking radio . Murphy tightens his grip still more .
MURPHY: Conveniently enough for you .
DODGE: Look , I did n't touch it . Alright ?
EPPS: It 's Greer .
GREER: Never been more thirsty in my life .
MURPHY: Drink up then .
GREER: Lost my sea legs .
EPPS: Any dizziness ?
GREER: No .
EPPS: Headache , nausea , lights ?
GREER: Lights ?
EPPS: Sudden flashes of light .
GREER: I feel fine .
DODGE: What day is it ?
GREER: I do n't know . Tuesday ?
DODGE: Wrong . It 's Friday .
EPPS: Try Wednesday .
DODGE: Right . Wednesday .
GREER: What happened ?
MURPHY: You do n't remember ?
GREER: Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera . Down somewhere in there scavenging around .
MURPHY: You 've been out for about a day .
GREER: Say what ?
MURPHY: Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins . Greer only holds there .
GREER: Oh , man .
MURPHY: We heard you scream . Any idea what you might 've seen ?
GREER: I wish I could tell you . I 'd be real interested to know myself .
MURPHY: The ah the radio 's out .
EPPS: What ?
MURPHY: Somebody took it out of commission last night . A beat as they all hold there .
EPPS: But , who ?
DODGE: The skipper seems to think I did it . That I 'm more interested in that gold than my own safety or the safety of my fellow shipmates .
EPPS: Did you ?
DODGE: Hell no . You think I 'm crazy ? Another beat as they hold there .
MURPHY: Regardless of how it happened , there is n't much of a chance to fix it . The odds of another vessel in range of the walkie-talkies are almost astronomical . So , as of today , we 're pretty much on our own out here .
EPPS: Murphy .
MURPHY: February first .
EPPS: The same day she supposedly went down .
MURPHY: Must not 've been the captain 's entry . He was probably out of the picture y then . Epps continues to read .
EPPS: `` Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision . Distress calls have been made . ''
MURPHY: Collision ? With what ?
EPPS: The page 's missing . Then their SOS was real .
MURPHY: But where 's the damage ?
EPPS: Maybe the other ship took the worst of it .
MURPHY: If it was a ship she hit .
DODGE: Dodge to Murphy ! Murphy reaches down for his radio .
MURPHY: Yeah .
DODGE: You better get down here right now ! We 're taking water ! Big time !
MURPHY: What the hell happened !
DODGE: Turbine chamber on number two must 've lown ! Took out part of the hull !
GREER: We 're not gon na be able to pump it !
MURPHY: Alright . Everybody grab your gear ! This ' is where we get off !
GREER: Rotten stem to stern . Guess you could n't expect much else .
MURPHY: The coast guard has our last position . They 'll send somebody out soon enough . A ship this size you ca n't exactly miss .
EPPS: It 's a good bet they 'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too .
MURPHY: Let 'em ask . This ship 's legally ours now .
DODGE: When they find out what it 's carrying , they may not be so interested in what 's legal .
GREER: Maybe you shoulda thought a that efore you scuttled our boat . Dodge turns to see Greer . A beat .
DODGE: The turbine blew .
GREER: Lem me see , was that before or afte the oil fire ? A beat . Dodge takes a swing at Greer .
MURPHY: Easy , easy .
GREER: Gettin ' a little hot under the collar , I 'd say .
MURPHY: Shut up .
GREER: Must be a little too the truth , eh Dodge ?
MURPHY: I said , shut the hell up . Murphy shoves Dodge back .
DODGE: Just wanted to check on our little aby . A beat as they look on at the gold .
MURPHY: If money can buy what he wants .
DODGE: I do n't figure there 's much I want money ca n't buy .
MURPHY: Then you 're a lucky man .
DODGE: Right .
EPPS: Murphy ?
GIRL: You must leave . A beat as Epps stands there .
EPPS: Who are you ?
GIRL: There 's great evil here , more than you can know . Leave now or you may never leave .
EPPS: But
DODGE: You 'd think on a ship this size there 'd be something left to eat .
GREER: After fifty years there ai n't nothin ' left but shoe leather .
MURPHY: Tomorrow we 'll see if we ca n't find some line and tackle . Use some of those bodies below decks for bait .
DODGE: There 's a charming thought .
GREER: We can always start shooting birds . Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette .
DODGE: What say , Epps ? You up for some oasted albatross ?
EPPS: Why not ?
GREER: Looks like we 're in a strong current . Must be making almost five knots full on ass backwards . Greer crosses to the window , stepping up .
MURPHY: Let 's just hope somebody sees us first out here .
MURPHY: It 's a Noaa buoy .
GREER: A what ?
MURPHY: Government weather . It 's got a transmitter aboard .
EPPS: Higher . You 're gon na miss it . Murphy holds the loop steady .
GREER: We 're still drifting .
MURPHY: The mooring has n't come taught .
EPPS: It 's not gon na hold us .
MURPHY: Does n't matter .
DODGE: No fucking way .
MURPHY: Damn it .
EPPS: Hey .
MURPHY: Hey .
EPPS: Could n't sleep .
MURPHY: Wish I could say the same . They watch the fire in silence for a moment .
EPPS: What do you think happened on this oat ?
MURPHY: I guess that 's the sixty four thousand dollar question , is n't it ?
EPPS: The what ?
MURPHY: Never mind . Before your time . I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts . The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune . Equal parts greed and paranoia , usually resulting in homicide . What happened after that is anybody 's guess . But , judging by our Greek friends down below , it does n't look like the last time .
EPPS: Are we smart enough to avoid that ?
MURPHY: I do n't know , are we ?
EPPS: When you found me yesterday , at the pool . I 'd seen something . Someone .
MURPHY: Not our mystery guest again .
EPPS: No . Someone else . A girl . I 'm not sure she was real . She looks up to Murphy .
MURPHY: Not real ? A beat as she only looks back .
EPPS: I do n't know what else you 'd call her . One second she was there , the next she was gone . Another beat as he looks on at her .
MURPHY: Showing you what ?
EPPS: What happened .
MURPHY: Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks .
EPPS: No . I think they are , were , just passengers . Innocent victims .
MURPHY: Victims of what ?
EPPS: Something bad happened here , Murphy .
MURPHY: That much I think we 've already established .
EPPS: More than just a mutiny . More than just the gold . A beat as he holds there .
MURPHY: What 's that supposed to mean ?
EPPS: I do n't know . A beat as she looks back .
MURPHY: Why you ? How come the rest of us have n't seen these people ?
EPPS: Just lucky I guess . Another beat as he holds on her .
MURPHY: Well . Getting off this ship 's exactly what we 're trying to do . Short of that , I do n't know what else to tell you .
EPPS: Dodge . Dodge .
MURPHY: You 're late .
DODGE: Sorry .
MURPHY: Do n't fall asleep .
DODGE: Right .
VOICE: `` Cock-a-doodle-doo , '' said the rooste to the crow . `` Where are you now ? I know but wo n't say so . '' Dodge hits the talk button .
DODGE: Who is this ?
VOICE: Penny whistle toy . Penny whistle toy .
MURPHY: Dodge ?
EPPS: Check it out .
GREER: I do n't even want to know what that 's gon na taste like now .
EPPS: Better than starving to death . Epps ' radio CRACKLES AWAKE .
MURPHY: Murphy to Epps .
EPPS: Epps , over .
MURPHY: Either of you seen Dodge ? She looks to Greer who shakes his head .
EPPS: Nope .
MURPHY: He 's not on deck and I ca n't raise him on the radio .
GREER: Must 've heard something below deck and went down to check it out . A beat as they hold there .
MURPHY: Alright . We stay together . Nobody goes any further than earshot .
EPPS: Right here .
MURPHY: Greer ?
GREER: Yeah , yeah .
EPPS: Murphy ?
GREER: Sorry . Did n't mean to scare you . She holds there a beat , looking around .
EPPS: Yeah . Fine . I just thought I heard something is all .
GREER: What ?
EPPS: Nothing . Let 's get outa here .
GREER: Ca n't find the shotgun .
MURPHY: So whoever did this now has ou shotgun .
GREER: Does n't look like it much matters .
EPPS: What do we do with him ?
MURPHY: Leave him till we can get some help . From now on , nobody comes down here .
GREER: What about the gold ?
MURPHY: Leave it .
GREER: Now hold up just a minute . Let 's be easonable here .
MURPHY: You think whoever did this is easonable ?
GREER: All I 'm saying is that gold 's worth a lot more to us now than it eve was .
EPPS: I ca n't believe you . Dodge 's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share .
GREER: I did n't sign up to go home empty handed . And I sure ai n't gon na roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this .
MURPHY: Nobody 's going anywhere with that gold now . Anybody tries to board , we 'll know about it . You can do what you want , Greer . But neither of us is gon na risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that .
GREER: Fine with me .
EPPS: Greer ?
GREER: Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska getofedobrodijotosiantosg .
EPPS: Murphy ! I 'm on C deck , cabin 400 ! Get down here now ! !
MURPHY: Smashed the radio . Scuttled the boat . Killed Dodge . Would 've killed you . He 's off his nut , no doubt there .
EPPS: Could be a stroke . Who knows ? The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves . `` Like wild dogs . ''
MURPHY: Over the gold .
EPPS: Maybe it was more than that .
MURPHY: Crazy with greed . Not crazy . Not like him .
EPPS: If the weather holds it might not be so bad .
MURPHY: It 's not the weather I 'm worried about . The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat .
EPPS: Murphy ?
VOICE: `` Cock-a-doodle-doo , said the rooste to the crow . Where are you now ? I know but wo n't say so . ''
MOTHER: `` Cock-a-doodle-doo , said the rooste to the crow . Where are you now ? I know but wo n't say so . ''
THE GIRL: Sorry .
FATHER: What do you think ?
MOTHER: He certainly did shorten it , did n't he ?
FATHER: I thought this was all the rage .
KATIE: Maybe last year . Katie joins them from the outer room .
FATHER: What about this year ?
KATIE: It 's not your color anyway .
GIRL: I like it , daddy .
FATHER: Well thank you !
GIRL: Daddy , how much longer before we start moving again ?
FATHER: They 're working on the engines , honey . As soon as they fix them we 'll be on our way .
MUTINEER: You like that , daddy ? I 'll show you something else now .
KATIE: It is n't real .
MURPHY: Epps to Murphy . Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK .
EPPS: Epps to Murphy .
MURPHY: We hit land .
EPPS: What ?
MURPHY: We 're in an island chain . It 's only a matter of time before we hit anothe one .
EPPS: Greer 's gone . He broke out of the tank .
MURPHY: Let 's get the hell out of here .
EPPS: It was you .
MURPHY: It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody . You saw it coming as well as I did . Dodge had his plans , starting with scuttling the boat . And Greer too , except he went nuts . Could n't take it , I guess . Could 've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage . But did it make him any less dangerous ? I do n't think so .
EPPS: So you killed them ?
MURPHY: The way I figure it , it was them o me . I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch ? Bought a little time . Made it look like whoeve killed those Greeks was still around . But it 's just us on this ship . Us and your spirit friends .
EPPS: And now you 're gon na kill me , is that it ?
MURPHY: I did n't want it to turn out this way .
EPPS: Murphy , do n't you see what 's happening ?
MURPHY: I think I see it pretty well .
EPPS: It 's the ship . The ship 's making you think this way .
MURPHY: I know a little bit about human nature and what I 've seen only confirms that .
EPPS: It 's a trap . There was no way we were gon na get away with that gold . Nobody ever does . It 's just the bait . This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out .
MURPHY: I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long , with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo . There 's nothing supernatural about greed . And that 's what it comes down to , pure and simple .
EPPS: I do n't give a damn about the gold .
MURPHY: I wish I could believe that . Eithe way , you know what I 've done . I 've got no choice . He raises the shotgun .
MURPHY: There 's no reason to make this any more difficult than it has to be .
SPEAKER: High school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life . It is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from thei experiences . After all , that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from ou textbooks , and often we can turn the negative experiences that are common to all high-schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement . In coming to terms with my own personal setback , which I 'm sure you 've all heard about , I 've een able to learn a lot about myself . I 've learned for one thing that I do n't need to rely on drugs and alcohol
APPLAUSE: and that I 'm very lucky-that more people besides Carrie and myself were n't hurt in the accident ; I 've learned that I 'm blessed with wonderful parents , teachers and above all the best classmates in the world I love each and every one of you guys ! !

REBECCA: You loser .

REBECCA: Unless they 're in your Summer school class !

ENID: What are you going to be when you grow up , Todd ?
TODD: Well I 'm going to major in Business Administration and , I think , mino in Communications .

JOHN: Well , if it is n't Enid and Rebecca , the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend .
ENID: You 're late , asshole .
JOHN: Fine , and how are you ?

JOHN: Hey , where are you going ?
ENID: Later , `` Dude '' .
REBECCA: Much later .
ENID: In fact , never .
REBECCA: What do you do if you 're a satanist , anyway ?
ENID: You know , sacrifice virgins and stuff
REBECCA: That lets us off the hook .
ENID: Maybe there 's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the othe egular customers are in on it except for us .
REBECCA: Or maybe not .
ENID: Maybe they 're slowly poisoning us o they 're planning to brainwash us and
REBECCA: Okay , okay !
ENID: Hey , look at this
REBECCA: God , it 's so totally pathetic .

AL: I imagine so ! Also , we have a spinach tortellini in a ricotta sauce . Both of those are $ 6.95 shall I give you a few minutes to mull it over ?
ENID: I just want an order of onion rings .
REBECCA: I might actually get the pasta special .
ENID: You loser !

REBECCA: God , that 's so pathetic . I bet she did n't even notice him .

OOMIE: Girls ! Shh ! Enid and Rebecca exit .

ENID: It 's just an excuse for us to spend time with you . Enid and Rebecca giggle .
REBECCA: So Josh , if this guy freaks out , will you protect us ?
JOSH: He has every reason to freak out this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody !
ENID: God , I think Josh is too mature fo us .
REBECCA: I know , look at the way he drives he 's like an old man .
ENID: Yeah , Josh , c'mon MOVE IT !
REBECCA: Look , maybe that 's him !
ENID: It 's still twenty-five minutes early .

JOSH: So , where 's `` Weird Al '' ?
ENID: SHH ! He 's back there . I can see his hair bobbing up and down .
REBECCA: I want to `` make love '' to him .
ENID: I 'm going to tell him you said that . WEIRD AL approaches with menus .
AL: So nice to see you again , ladies .
ENID: Hey , Weird Al , there 's something my friend wants to tell you

ENID: Is he wearing a green cardigan ?
REBECCA: What exactly is a cardigan anyway ? The GUY joins a friend .
ENID: That 's not him Jesus , stop freaking me out .
JOSH: In answer to your question , I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form
ENID: I figured something like that
REBECCA: Oh my God !
ENID: It 's obviously him !
REBECCA: I ca n't believe it !
ENID: Oh my god , he just ordered a giant glass of milk !
JOSH: It 's a vanilla milkshake .
REBECCA: What 's he doing now ?
ENID: He 's still just sitting there . God , this is totally unbearable !
JOSH: I agree .
REBECCA: I wish I could see him .
ENID: Go ahead and look , but do n't make it too obvious
REBECCA: Do you think he knows ?
ENID: I dunno
AL: Not a thing .
JOSH: Jesus , look at this guy .
ENID: Oh my God , that 's HIM !
REBECCA: Are you sure ?
ENID: Totally ! Look !
REBECCA: We should follow him home .
JOSH: Forget it .
ENID: Come on , Josh do n't you want to see where he lives ?
JOSH: No .
ENID: But this guy is like a one-of-kind , are butterfly , and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat
JOSH: You need counseling .
REBECCA: God , he lives right in ou neighborhood !
ENID: He does n't even look that bummed out , really .
REBECCA: I know would n't you be totally pissed off ?
ENID: This kind of thing must happen to him all the time .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Returning to the house of my Fatherfatherfatherfather
ROBERTA: That piece is entitled `` Mirror/Father/Mirror . '' I like to show it to people I 'm meeting fo the first time because it says so much about who I am and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin . And this is exactly what I 'm hoping to get from each of you over the course of this Summer a picture of your own self-exploration . My own ackground is in video and performance art , but I 'm hoping that does n't influence you and that you 'll find your own ways of externalizing the internal . At the end of the Summer , this class has been invited , along with several others in the area , to participate in a show of High-School art at the Neighborhood Activity Center . The title of the show will e `` Brotherhood and Community Art as Dialogue . '' I think the `` Brotherhood '' theme ties in nicely with the theme of self-discovery that I 'd like to emphasize in this class . Are there any questions so far ? Great
ENID: This is way too creepy .
REBECCA: He wo n't see us we 'll just stalk him from a distance .
ENID: I 'm afraid if I see him , I 'll start feeling really bad again . A pause .
REBECCA: The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter Oh my God , The National Psoriasis Foundation !
ENID: Bingo !
REBECCA: Wait ! Do you hear that ?
ENID: Shit !
REBECCA: What should we do ? What if he ecognizes us ?
ENID: Come on , it 's too late now
REBECCA: Gross !
ENID: I think it 's cute - look at his little weasel teeth .
REBECCA: Ew , it 's like some gross rat
JOE: It 's a mongoose .
REBECCA: Mm
ENID: A what ?
JOE: A mongoose they eat snakes you never heard of a mongoose ? That 's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy . Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that .
ENID: How much is this ?
JOE: Umm That 's not officially fo sale I might have to hang onto that for the time being .
ENID: That 's okay
JOE: Seymour does .
ENID: Who does ?
JOE: Him . Seymour . He 's the man with the ecords .
ENID: Do you have any old Indian records ?
SEYMOUR: Indian records ?
ENID: You know , like weird 1960 's Indian ock n ' roll music .
SEYMOUR: I do n't have anything after about 1935 . I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection , but it 's not really for sale . I do n't eally collect `` foreign . ''
ENID: Sure ! Wait , maybe not 78s , but I can play regular records He points her to a nearby box of LPs .
SEYMOUR: There 's some good stuff in here do you like old music ?
ENID: Sure , I guess .
SEYMOUR: Well there 's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff .
ENID: Is this one any good ?
SEYMOUR: Nah , it 's not so great . Here 's the one I 'd recommend .
ENID: Wow !
SEYMOUR: A dollar seventy-five .
ENID: Okay . She pays him .
SEYMOUR: If you do n't like it bring it back for a refund . We 're here every Saturday . He puts the record into a bag .
ENID: I 'm sure it 's fine .
REBECCA: That was truly pathetic .
ENID: I know I still ca n't get ove that his name was `` Seymour . ''
REBECCA: He was so excited when you bought that record you 're a saint ! God , these apartments are supe expensive
ENID: It was so cute how he had his own little bags . I thought I was going to start crying ! Do you think they 're gay ?
REBECCA: What about the `` striking redhead in the yellow dress '' ?
ENID: Oh yeah
REBECCA: He should totally just kill himself Hey , here 's one Oh wait you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats
ENID: I dunno I kind of like him He 's the exact opposite of everything I really hate In a way he 's such a clueless dork that he 's almost cool
REBECCA: That guy is many things but he definitely is n't `` cool '' This one would be okay , but there 's no kitchen
ENID: Yeah , but you know what I mean .
REBECCA: Not really
ENID: Forget it , I ca n't explain it Awkward silence . Melorra enters .
MELORRA: Oh my god , what are you guys doing here ?
ENID: What are you doing here , Melorra ?
MELORRA: My acting workshop is across the street from here . I 'm just on my eak .
ENID: Well , we wo n't keep you .
MELORRA: I love this place it 's so - you know , `` funky . '' Enid and Rebecca look at each other .
REBECCA: We 're looking for an apartment .
MELORRA: God how cool . Where are you moving ?
ENID: We 're not sure yet , that 's why we 're looking .
REBECCA: Somewhere downtown .
MELORRA: God that 's so exciting ! Oops , I should go . Bye you guys ! Call me . Melorra leaves quickly .
REBECCA: `` Funky '' ?
ENID: What , is she black now ?
REBECCA: I 've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we 're like these totally rich yuppies
ENID: What are you talking about ?
REBECCA: That 's who people want to rent to . It 's a known fact that it 's way easie to get a job and everything if you 're ich All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it 's no big deal it 'll be fun .
ENID: You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you .
REBECCA: Just promise you 'll do it .
ENID: Okay , okay , I promise Jesus , you 're out of your mind .
DAD: Have you seen my blue spatula ?
ENID: Nope . What are you making , pancakes ?
DAD: Not if I do n't find that goddamn spatula .
REBECCA: When did you do that ?
ENID: What ? How long have you been standing there ?
REBECCA: Did you have to buy new hair dye o did you still have some left ove from eighth grade ?
ENID: Fuck you , bitch !
REBECCA: It 's always closed
ENID: I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back . They continue walking .
REBECCA: Where are we going ?
ENID: Let 's go hassle Josh .
REBECCA: `` Hassle '' ?
ENID: As always .
REBECCA: Waiting for the bus that neve comes
ENID: I wonder if he 's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or
REBECCA: Why do n't you ask him .
ENID: Hi what 's your name ?
MAN: Norman .
ENID: are you waiting for a bus ?
MAN: Yes .
ENID: I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago There are no buses on this street .
MAN: You do n't know what you 're talking about .
ENID: JOSH !
REBECCA: JOSH !
ENID: He 's probably in there jerking off .
REBECCA: I 'll bet he never jerks off
ENID: Yeah , he 's beyond human stuff like that .
REBECCA: Should we leave a note ?
ENID: Do you have a pen ?
REBECCA: You 're not really going to leave that are you ? Enid pushes the note over his doorknob .
ENID: It 'll only take a second .
CREEP #1: I 'm telling you , you 're wrong carpet beetles are the only way to get the flesh off a corpse Boiling is strictly for amateurs !
ENID: Do n't you creeps ever talk about anything nice ? Do n't you ever talk about fluffy kittens or the Easte Bunny ?
CREEP #1: Look who 's talking - little miss adass
CREEP #2: Yeah , nice outfit - who are you supposed to be , Cyndi Lauper ?
ENID: Blow me , doofus !
JOHN ELLIS: Did n't they tell you ?
ENID: Tell me what ?
JOHN ELLIS: Punk rock is over !
ENID: I know it 's over , asshole , I
JOHN ELLIS: If you really want to `` fuck up the system '' - you should go to business school that 's what I 'm gon na do get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside !
ENID: That 's not even
JOHN ELLIS: Yeah yeah yeah . Do you have my money ?
ENID: That tape sucked , by the way !
JOHN ELLIS: I 'm so sorry if you were offended !
ENID: Go die , asshole !
JOHN ELLIS: Get a job ! He exits . Rebecca walks over to Enid .
REBECCA: What was that all about ?
ENID: It 's not like I 'm some modern Punk dickhead It 's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look , but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it !
REBECCA: I did n't get it either .
ENID: Everybody 's too stupid !
SEYMOUR: So you really liked it ? Yeah , there 's some really rare performances . You liked that Memphis Minnie , huh ?
ENID: Yeah , that 's good too the whole ecord was good , but that one song , `` Devil Got My Woman '' I mostly just keep playing that one over and over Do you have any other records like that ?
SEYMOUR: The Skip James record ? Yeah , that 's a masterpiece . There are no othe ecords like that ! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection . It 's one of maybe five known copies .
ENID: Wow !
SEYMOUR: Do you want to see it ? I can run upstairs and get it
ENID: Yeah , sure , I guess
SEYMOUR: Watch my stuff .
JOE: You still interested in that ?
ENID: I thought it was n't for sale .
JOE: I 'm thinkin ' maybe I could let it go
ENID: It 's kind of falling apart .
SEYMOUR: Here it is . It 's only about V minus and has an incipient lam crack , but plays decent as I recall .
ENID: Wow Enid pretends to drop the record .
SEYMOUR: NO ! ! !
ENID: Hey , I was only kidding !
ROBERTA: I 'm not going to start a discourse on the subject of `` good '' art vs. `` bad '' art ; these judgments are fo each person to make on his own . I merely want to help each of you find the best way to look within yourselves the best key to your particular lock . Last week I asked you to-try and create a piece of artwork that esponds to something that you have strong feelings about .
PHILLIP: Uh it 's uh it 's about The Mutilator
ROBERTA: My goodness !
PHILLIP: It 's this really great video game about a guy who kills people with a ig hammer
ROBERTA: I thought maybe this was supposed to e your father .
ENID: Enid . It 's sort of like a diary I guess .
ROBERTA: I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves . We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues ; emotional , spiritual , political ; of great importance . I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class . ( pause , points at
WIRE SCULPTURE: Who is responsible for this ?
MARGARET: I am .
ROBERTA: Talk to us about it
MARGARET: It 's my response to the issue of a woman 's right to choose it 's something I feel super-strongly about .
ROBERTA: Is n't this a wonderful piece , class ? This definitely falls into that highe category of art I was speaking of earlier .
CUSTOMER: I 'm looking for a copy of 8 1/2 .
REBECCA: How about this one ?
ENID: Hey , you have to see my new good luck charm .
REBECCA: Ew when did you get that ?
ENID: This morning at Seymour 's garage sale .
REBECCA: God , are n't you tired of Seymou yet ? Rebecca picks up another tape .
ENID: Forget it . I 'm sure it sucks . All these movies suck .
REBECCA: We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom efore I start my stupid job .
ENID: I know a party we could go to
REBECCA: What ? Where ? !
ENID: It 's a surprise .
REBECCA: I do n't believe you .
ENID: If I promise you there 's really a party with a lot of guys , do you promise you 'll go ?
JEROME: There are some records I will pay serious money for , provided they 're a sincere V plus . Other than that I 'd prefer to just have them on CD .
STEVEN: CDs will never have the presence of an original 78 .
JEROME: WRR-ONG ! A digital transfer adequately mastered will sound identical to the original . Do you have a decent equalizer ?
STEVEN: I have a Klipsch 2B3 .
JEROME: Obviously the problem ! You expect a ten-band equalizer to impart state of-the-art sound ? Dream a little dream ! etc Enid & Rebecca are sitting nearby .
REBECCA: I totally , totally hate you .
ENID: Aw c'mon , this is a fun party .
GERROLD: So what 's the story with the two cheerleaders over here ?
JOE: They 're Seymour 's .
GERROLD: Seymour ? You got ta be kidding me !
JOE: Do n't worry about it . He 's not gettin ' any and neither are you .
GERROLD: Let me tell ya somethin ' , Joe Listen to me , Joe you ca n't hit a home run without swinging the bat !
JOE: Right .
GERROLD: Mind if I sit here ?
REBECCA: Yes .

REBECCA: Melorra
GERROLD: Melorra , listen to me - let me tell you something Melorra you seem like an interesting chick - what are you doing hanging out with these losers here ? Whaddya say you and me take off and hit some nightspots etc . etc .
ENID: I 'll be right back , I 'm gon na go get a beer .
REBECCA: Wait
SEYMOUR: but it plays like new . There 's no groove wear .
PAUL: Oh please It has an enlarged cente hole and a hair crack . Enid approaches them .
SEYMOUR: But the crack is so tight it 's completely inaudible .
PAUL: A tight hair crack is just that - a crack . I do n't collect cracked ecords . I only pay a premium for mint records Seymour , you know that ! Please !
ENID: What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks ?
SEYMOUR: I I did n't think you would have any interest in this get together I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you it 's not like a real party o anything .
ENID: You 're right about that . So this is your record collection ?
SEYMOUR: Oh God no . This is just junk I have for sale or trade . The record room is off-limits .
ENID: Really ? Can I see it ?
SEYMOUR: Yeah , well sure you can if you want to it 's just I do n't want all these guys in there at once you know
ENID: Wow ! This is like my dream room ! Are these all records !
SEYMOUR: I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point . I 've tried to pare down my collection to the essential
ENID: God , look at this poster ! I ca n't elieve this room ! You 're the luckiest guy in the world ! I 'd kill to have stuff like this !
SEYMOUR: Please go ahead and kill me ! This stuff does n't make you happy , elieve me .
ENID: Oh , come on ! What are you talking about ?
SEYMOUR: You think it 's healthy to obsessively collect things ? You ca n't connect with other people so you fill you life with stuff I 'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers . Enid writes her name in the dust .
ENID: No you 're not ! You 're a cool guy , Seymour .
SEYMOUR: Yeah right If I 'm so cool , why have n't I had a girlfriend in fou years ? I ca n't even remember the last time a girl talked to me .
ENID: I 'm talking to you I 'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute !
SEYMOUR: Oh , right
ENID: No really I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds
SEYMOUR: Good luck
ENID: I 'm totally serious !
SEYMOUR: Yeah , well
ENID: I mean it You leave everything to me I 'm going to be your own personal dating service !
SEYMOUR: I appreciate the offer but you really do n't
ENID: Mark my words , by the end of this summer you 'll be up to your neck in pussy !
SEYMOUR: Jesus ! That 's very nice of you Enid ut I - I really
ENID: What about her ? Would you go out with her ?
SEYMOUR: I do n't know , what kind of question is that ? I mean it 's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me
ENID: But putting that aside for now , would you go out with her ?
SEYMOUR: I really did n't get a good look at her . A breasty , overweight 40-year-old walks by .
ENID: Okay , what about this one ? Are you into girls with big tits ?
SEYMOUR: Jesus !
ENID: C'mon Seymour , I 'm trying to collect data here ! Do n't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl ?
SEYMOUR: I 'm just not one of those guys who has a `` type ''
ENID: Every guy has a type !
SEYMOUR: I mean as long as she 's not a complete imbecile and she 's even remotely attractive They walk by `` the pants . ''
ENID: Hey look , there 's Norman !
SEYMOUR: Maybe I do n't want to meet someone who shares my interests . I hate my interests ! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself ?
ENID: Yeah yeah yeah Just tell me you five main interests , in order of importance .
SEYMOUR: Well , let 's see I guess I 'd have to put Traditional Jazz , Blues , and Ragtime music at the top of the list , then probably
ENID: Let 's just say `` music '' - that way you only use up one Wait , we have to go in here for a second
JOSH: Hi .
ENID: I just stopped in to say hi .
JOSH: Yeah , well hi

DAD: It 's tough to find a good job without any kind of training .
ENID: Look , I told you I 'm not going to college .
DAD: Well , I think it 's good to keep all your options open . You can always enroll for the winter quarter . You could even live here and go to the city college part time , and still get a job if you wanted to .
ENID: Look at me I 'm not even listening to a word you 're saying . Pause .
DAD: Did I tell you who I ran into at the agel place ?
ENID: Who ?
DAD: Guess .
ENID: How should I know ?
DAD: Someone from the past .
ENID: Who ?
DAD: Give up ?
ENID: YES .
DAD: Maxine .
ENID: Not the Maxine ?
DAD: Yup .
ENID: God , how horrifying .
REBECCA: you do n't have to make a million dollars just get any stupid jo so we can at least start looking fo an apartment .
ENID: I wonder if I hang around with you ecause you 're like my surrogate mother figure or something . Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly .
REBECCA: You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you .
ENID: Or maybe did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos ? Maybe that 's why we spend so much time together .
REBECCA: You 're gross . See that guy ?
ENID: Which one ?
REBECCA: He gives me a total boner !
ENID: He 's like the biggest idiot of all time !
COLLEGE SOPHOMORE: Are you guys up for some reggae tonight ?
REBECCA: Okay , you 're right .
ENID: Heads up .
GUY: Hey , my band is playing here on Friday night and uh there 's gon na be a unch of cool bands playing and stuff and you do n't have to pay if you show this flyer at the door you should come check it out .
REBECCA: Thanks
ENID: Which one is your band ?
GUY: Alien Autopsy .
ENID: Bitchin ' .
GUY: Yeah , well maybe I 'll see you there
ENID: What a dork !
REBECCA: You 're just jealous .
ENID: Yeah , right Believe me , at this point I 'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me !
REBECCA: Face it , you hate every single boy on the face of the earth !
ENID: That 's not true , I just hate all these obnoxious , extroverted , pseudo- ohemian losers ! Sometimes I think I act so weird ecause I 'm crazy from sexual frustration .
REBECCA: Have n't you heard about the miracle of masturbation ?
ENID: maybe we should be lesbos
REBECCA: Get away from me !
ROBERTA: Who is this , Enid ?
ENID: It 's supposed to be Don Knotts .
ROBERTA: And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ?
ENID: I dunno I just like Don Knotts .
ROBERTA: I see interesting She moves on .
MARGARET: It 's a tampon in a teacup Class GIGGLES .
ROBERTA: I can see that now what can you tell us about it ? First of all , what kind of sculpture is this ?
MARGARET: It 's a `` found object '' that 's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art .
ROBERTA: Very good . Now , what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent ?
MARGARET: I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood , because of tea parties in the olden days , but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this like
ROBERTA: This shocking image of repressed femininity !
MARGARET: Right , exactly !
ROBERTA: I think it 's really a wonderful piece , Margaret ! Enid gives Margaret another dirty look .
DISC JOCKEY: KFTO comin ' atchya on this beautiful evening .
SEYMOUR: God , that asshole 's voice is so hateful ! No wonder I never listen to the radio !
ENID: Relax , Seymour , relax
SEYMOUR: That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it 's like someone jabbing me in the face ! KFTO comin ' atchya on this beautiful evening
ENID: So , why did you bring this along ?
SEYMOUR: I brought it for him to autograph . He 's going to be amazed to see it - it 's one of two known copies I ca n't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner . What an insult !
ENID: This bar 's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from .
SEYMOUR: I 'm not holding my breath in that department .
ENID: Jesus , Seymour .
SEYMOUR: I ca n't believe these people ! They could at least turn off their stupid sports game until he 's done playing !
ENID: Well , offer her a seat ! You want me to do it ?
SEYMOUR: Wait a minute ! Hang on ! Jesus , I got ta think of something to talk to her about . No ! No
ENID: Just wait here .
CUTE GIRL: Hi .
SEYMOUR: Hello . Uh that was great music , huh ?
CUTE GIRL: Yeah , I just love blues .
SEYMOUR: Actually , technically what he was mostly playing would more accurately e classified in the `` ragtime '' idiom . Although of course not in the strictest sense of the more classical agtime piano music like that of Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb . Authentic Blues has a more conventional twelve- ar structure in its stanzas .
CUTE GIRL: Oh if you like authentic blues , you 've just got ta see Blueshammer ! They 're so great !
LEAD SINGER: All right people ! Are you ready to BOOGIE ? Cuz we gwine play you some authentic , way-down-in-the-delta lues to rock your world ! One , Two , Three
SEYMOUR: What did you tell that girl ?
ENID: I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label .
SEYMOUR: Jesus
ENID: We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who is n't a total idiot , that 's all .
SEYMOUR: Look , I really appreciate your help , Enid , but let 's face it , this is hopeless .
ENID: It 's not hopeless
SEYMOUR: Yeah , well it 's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pai of Nikes and they 're happy ! I just ca n't relate to 99.9 % of humanity .
ENID: Yeah , well , I ca n't relate to humanity either , but I do n't think it 's totally hopeless
SEYMOUR: But it 's not totally hopeless fo you I 've had it . I do n't even have the energy to try anymore . You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you do n't end up like me
ENID: I 'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar At least you 're an interesting person at least you 're not exactly like everybody else
SEYMOUR: Hooray for me .
ENID: It does n't matter , I 'm not staying long I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet .
SEYMOUR: `` Yet . ''
ENID: Wow , this is so cool
SEYMOUR: If you do n't mind my asking why do you care so much if I get a date or not ?
ENID: I dunno because I ca n't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you ca n't get a date
SEYMOUR: What ? Oh that I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago I guess it 's mine now .
ENID: What , are you a klansman or something ?
SEYMOUR: Yeah , right , I 'm a klansman - thanks a lot ! Do you know the Cook 's Chicken franchise ?
ENID: `` Four-piece Cook 's special deep fried with side n ' slaw it 's OUT RAY-GEOUS '' !
SEYMOUR: Yeah , well `` Cook 's '' is just a made up name . When they originally opened ack in 1922 they were named `` The Coon Chicken Inn '' that 's an early painting of their first logo . He takes out a scrapbook .
ENID: Why does n't everybody know this ?
SEYMOUR: It 's ancient history . The same reason nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco ecord . He puts on another record .
ENID: You work at Cook 's Chicken ?
SEYMOUR: For nineteen years
ENID: What are you , a fry cook or something ?
SEYMOUR: Nothing so glamorous actually , I 'm an assistant manager at thei corporate headquarters .
ENID: Jesus , I 'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day .
SEYMOUR: Hey , I get good benefits , a good early retirement plan , nobody eve others me
ENID: Yeah , but still
SEYMOUR: I make enough money to eat and buy old records what more do I want ?
ENID: So , I do n't really get it are you saying that things were better back then even though there was stuff like this ?
SEYMOUR: No , in a lot of ways things are bette now I dunno it 's complicated . Everybody still hates each other , ut they know how to hide it better , or something
ENID: Hey , can I borrow this ?
SEYMOUR: What ? Why ?
ENID: I promise I 'll take good care of it .
SEYMOUR: I dunno they 're very sensitive at work about all this stuff . Maybe it would be better if you
ENID: Do n't you trust me , Seymour ?
ROBERTA: Let 's address some discussion to this piece .
SNOTTY GIRL: I do n't like it .
ROBERTA: Can you tell us why ?
SNOTTY GIRL: I do n't know .
BLACK GIRL: Yeah , it 's not right .
ROBERTA: These are all valid comments , but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this .
ENID: Well , I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook 's Chicken used to be called Coon 's Chicken , and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture
ROBERTA: Did you actually do this painting ?
ENID: Well , no - it 's more like a `` found art object . ''
ROBERTA: And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism ?
ENID: It 's complicated I guess I 'm trying to show how racism used to more out in the open and now it 's hidden , or something
ROBERTA: And how does an image like this help us to see that ?
ENID: I 'm not sure I mean I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it 's so shocking ?
ROBERTA: I do n't really know what to say , Enid It 's a remarkable achievement .
REBECCA: Are you kidding ? It 's a dream job ! I ca n't believe you got a job like that without even trying God , I wish that was my job
ENID: Yeah , maybe it 'll be okay . At least I 'll get to see every movie for free , I guess I had to lie and tell them I already graduated
REBECCA: When are you finally going to get your diploma ?
ENID: I dunno , but next week is my last class
REBECCA: Anyway , now we can start looking fo the apartment Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment ?
ENID: Was n't it like eighth grade ?
REBECCA: Seventh you wanted to move out ight then !
ENID: That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine
REBECCA: I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him .
ENID: We were such desperate sluts back then .
MANAGER: I 'm gon na let you handle the fou thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it 's slow and ease you into the bigge crowds .
ENID: You can count on me , sir !
LOSER: Do you serve beer or any alcohol ?
ENID: I wish ! actually you wish afte about five minutes of this movie you 'll wish to God you had about ten eers !
MANAGER: What are you doing ? You do n't eve criticize the feature !
ENID: Why ? What difference does it make ? You already got his money
MANAGER: Look , that 's the policy if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater
ENID: But I was only trying to be friendly
MANAGER: Look , we do n't pay you to be a movie critic just do your job .
ENID: Okay , okay I wo n't say a word ANOTHER ANGLE - an hour has gone by .
CUSTOMER: Medium popcorn .
ENID: That 's three dollars .
CUSTOMER: Let me have plenty of butter on that .
ENID: Ewww ! Here you go smothered in delicious yellow-chemical sludge !
MANAGER: What the hell is wrong with you ? !
ENID: What ? I 'm just kidding around with the customers It 's my shtick !
MANAGER: Well lose it ! And why are n't you pushing the large sizes ? Did n't you get training about upsizing ?
ENID: But I feel weird it 's so sleazy .
MANAGER: It 's not optional !
ENID: Jesus
CUSTOMER #2: Can I get a medium sprite ?
ENID: A medium sprite ? Why sir , do you not know that for a mere twenty five cents more you could purchase a large everage that has a volume of ove twice that of a puny medium drink ? I 'm only telling you this because we 're such good friends Medium is strictly for suckers who do n't understand the concept of value !
REBECCA: What are you talking about ? What kind of loser gets fired after one day ? !
ENID: I told you - my manager was a total asshole ! Do n't worry , I 'm going to get another job and anyway , I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime An angry CUSTOMER returns with her drink .
CUSTOMER: I 'm not at all happy with this latte what do you intend to do about it ?
REBECCA: This is it ? I ca n't believe you 're selling some of this stuff .
ENID: Fuck it . Everything must go !
REBECCA: Oh my god , I remember this hat this was during your little old lady phase
HIPSTER: How much is this ?
ENID: That 's not for sale .
HIPSTER: Wait , it says five dollars
ENID: Oh , that 's a mistake I decided not to sell it
REBECCA: What was that all about ? I thought everything must go !
ENID: Oh yeah right , like I 'm gon na let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus .
GIRL: How much is this dress ?
REBECCA: Oh my god , you 're selling that ?
ENID: That 's five hundred dollars .
GIRL: What ?
ENID: Five hundred .
GIRL: You 're crazy it should be like two dollars !
ENID: I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity .
GIRL: Well why do I care about that ?
ENID: Why do you even want it ? It would look stupid on you .
GIRL: God , fuck you !
ENID: Put that stuff back , it 's not fo sale .
BOY: What is this ? Some fuckin ' joke ?
ENID: Yes ! Go away ! They stomp off .
REBECCA: Now are you going to get a regula job ?
ENID: Do n't worry .
REBECCA: If it makes you feel any better , I do n't think you could 've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff .
ENID: Yeah , thanks .
REBECCA: Do you want to do something tonight ?
ENID: I ca n't , it 's Seymour 's birthday Shit ! What time is it ? I have to go to the store ! I was going to make him a cake
REBECCA: Well , are we still going shopping tomorrow ?
ENID: Yeah , I guess call me
REBECCA: Since when can you make a cake ?
ENID: You can open your eyes now .
SEYMOUR: Oh uh , thanks a lot Enid I eally appreciate it
ENID: No , Doofus blow it out !
SEYMOUR: Arrrghhh ! Ah Jeez Christ
ENID: Are you okay ?
SEYMOUR: It 's just my stupid back . I 'll be all right in a minute
ENID: What is that ?
SEYMOUR: Oh uh It 's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumba support
ENID: What , like a girdle ?
SEYMOUR: Maybe now you understand why I ca n't get a date .
ENID: Yeah , well , you 're not the only one . Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems It seems like only stupid people have good elationships
SEYMOUR: That 's the spirit !
ENID: I mean , I 'm eighteen years old and I 've never even had a real , steady oyfriend for more than like two weeks !
SEYMOUR: Really ?
ENID: Never
SEYMOUR: I 'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really would n't change anything .
ENID: I know . It 's not like it makes all your problems go away .
SEYMOUR: Then again , that 's easy for me to say , since I 'll never even get a date . I 'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you .
ENID: Actually , I 've got a total crush on this one guy right now , but it 's a eally fucked-up situation
SEYMOUR: Oh yeah ?
ENID: Oh wait , you met him remembe that guy Josh ? I 'm like practically obsessed with him , but I ca n't do anything about it because Becky would freak out .
SEYMOUR: Why ?
ENID: Never mind , it 's way too complicated Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you 're totally confused all the time ?
SEYMOUR: I wo n't even dignify that with a esponse .
ENID: I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them ?
SEYMOUR: Who knows ? The phone RINGS . Seymour ignores it .
ENID: Are n't you going to get that ?
SEYMOUR: Let the machine get it . I have no desire to talk to anyone who would e calling me
ENID: Wow ! What was that all about ?
SEYMOUR: It 's just somebody 's idea of a joke
ENID: That did n't sound like a joke to me what , did you write a personal ad or something ?
SEYMOUR: Uh yeah . A long time ago she called efore once it 's just somebody trying to humiliate me .
ENID: Seymour ! I promise you that was n't a joke you have to call her back !
SEYMOUR: How can you be so sure ?
ENID: Well , uh I 'm an expert-about stuff like this she was totally fo eal !
DAD: Pumpkin , do you remember Maxine ?
MAXINE: Hi , Enid .
ENID: Hi . Look , I 'm kind of tired - I think I 'll go to bed .
DAD: I made spaghetti . Do you want some ?
ENID: I-I really have to get up early fo class tomorrow .
MAXINE: It 's really quite something to see you all grown up like this , Enid . I 'd love to hear about what you 're doing . I ca n't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out What are you studying ? You were always such a smart little girl .
ENID: I 'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards .
ROBERTA: Smile , Enid
ENID: Uh-oh .
ROBERTA: Do n't worry - it 's nothing bad . I was just wondering what your plans were for next year ?
ENID: I 'm not really sure - working , I guess
ROBERTA: Well , I know this is really short notice , but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I 'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one yea scholarship program and , well , I hope you do n't mind , Enid , but I took the liberty of submitting you name .
ENID: Hmm .
ROBERTA: As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything it is eally quite an offer
ENID: wow
ROBERTA: So what do you think ?
ENID: I dunno Would I have to take classes and stuff ?
ROBERTA: Well , yes
ROBERTA: Let me know as soon as you can , Enid . This could be a great thing for you .
ENID: I think one of us should fuck Josh
REBECCA: Go ahead
ENID: No , really
REBECCA: God , you 're really obsessed
ENID: I am not I just think it 'd be funny to see what he 'd do
REBECCA: I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex , and that he 's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to ou level and all that
ENID: Yeah , but maybe one of us should at least try
REBECCA: No matter what happened it would be a big disaster Let 's just try and keep everything the way it is .
ENID: I ca n't afford stuff like this right now .
REBECCA: I 'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we 're eve going to move . Are n't these the greatest towels ?
ENID: Why do you care about this kind of stuff ?
REBECCA: Do n't you want nice stuff ?
ENID: I ca n't imagine spending money on towels .
REBECCA: You do n't have to . I 'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job .
ENID: You 're insane .
REBECCA: Do you still want to go to that thing tonight ?
ENID: What thing ?
REBECCA: That guy 's band is playing tonight Alien Autopsy .
ENID: Oh yeah maybe Seymour 's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls , so I can hear how bad it went .
REBECCA: God , I 'm so sick of Seymour .
SEYMOUR: That was great - jeez , thanks again for cooking all this .
DANA: Oh I love to cook . I guess most women would n't invite a man over on the first date , but I believe you should trust your instincts . When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so I do n't know harmless . Ready for ice cream ?
SEYMOUR: Yeah where is this ? Bosnia ?
DANA: Was it Bosnia ? I forget It 's so sad , the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy . A Soul/Funk song starts up on the adio that catches her attention . She goes over and turns it up .
SEYMOUR: Uh , well , that 's okay - I do n't dance , heh , heh
DANA: Do n't be silly , anyone can dance . Here , just follow me watch my feet .
SEYMOUR: No , really I
DANA: C'mon Seymour , it 's all in your mind . Just loosen up and feel the music ! Here , put down your bowl of ice cream .
SEYMOUR: Hey , it 's nearly nine already - we 're gon na have to leave now if we 're going to make that movie .
DANA: Oh , all right Party-pooper ! Just let me put a few things away .
SEYMOUR: Uh , no . I missed that one . But what do I know ? I like Laurel and Hardy movies .
DANA: Really ? I never really cared fo those . Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one ?
SEYMOUR: Uh hello ?
ENID: Hi , it 's me
SEYMOUR: Oh , hi
ENID: So , what happened ?
SEYMOUR: Actually , it 's kind of still happening she 's over here right now I think everything 's going pretty well
ENID: What ? You 're kidding me
SEYMOUR: Yeah , so I better go it 's not eally the best time to talk
ENID: What , are you going to like have sex with her on your first date ?
SEYMOUR: Jesus , Enid I 'll talk to you later bye !
REBECCA: Hello ?
ENID: Do you still want to do something tonight ?
REBECCA: What happened to Seymour ?
ENID: I ca n't believe it - he actually scored !
REBECCA: How repulsive !
ENID: So should I come over ?
REBECCA: Actually , I 'm just about to go out with some friends
ENID: What are you talking about ? Who ?
REBECCA: Just some people from work
ENID: I do n't believe you .
REBECCA: Yeah well , you said you were busy look , I 'd better get going I 'll call you tomorrow .
JOSH: Hi what 's up ?
ENID: Can I come in ?
JOSH: Are you the one who left that note ?
ENID: I guess . Pause . Enid sits down on futon/sofa .
JOSH: So what 's up ?
ENID: I do n't know I 'm totally confused
JOSH: Do you want something to drink ?
ENID: Why ?
JOSH: What do you mean `` why '' ?
ENID: Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms ?
JOSH: Yeah , right
ENID: `` Yeah , right '' well why not ? What 's so wrong with me ?
JOSH: Nothing .
ENID: Then why do you hate me so much ?
JOSH: When did I say I hated you ?
ENID: You 've never once said anything even emotely nice to me .
JOSH: You make me nervous ! I always feel like you 're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me !
ENID: That 's just the way I am !
JOSH: Yeah , well
ENID: It 's just my stupid way of getting attention ! God , I practically love you , Josh !
JOSH: You must have known all along how I you know how I felt about you it must be totally obvious God I always used to dream about this
ENID: Why do you have that stupid poster ?
JOSH: Oh , hi
ENID: Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars ? It 's so typical Eithe they 're into cars or guns or sports or guitars it 's so obvious
JOSH: How long have you been up ?
ENID: I could n't sleep I should get going ; I feel really weird
JOSH: Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere ?
ENID: I do n't think we should Look , you have to totally promise me you wo n't tell Becky about this .
JOSH: Why not ?
ENID: Because if you do , I 'll kill you !
JOSH: Okay I promise .
ENID: Just take my word for it if she ever finds out about this I 'll neve hear the end of it
REBECCA: Goddammit , bitch where are you ?
ENID: Boo !
ENID: Where have you been ? I 've been looking all over for you I 've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you
SEYMOUR: Really ?
ENID: No , actually Joe told me you were here so how come you never call me anymore ?
SEYMOUR: I know , I 'm sorry I-I 've been eally busy
ENID: Yeah , I 'll bet ! So , how 's it going with what's-her-name ? Dana ?
SEYMOUR: Oh pretty well , surprisingly you know
ENID: So , what kind of stuff do you guys do together ? Is she into old records and stuff ?
SEYMOUR: Sort of she does n't dislike any of that stuff she 's trying , anyway actually , we 're supposed to go antique shopping for he apartment this afternoon
ENID: Sounds good Seymour looks again at his watch .
SEYMOUR: We really should get together sometime soon I-I 'll definitely call you this week
ENID: What , are you trying to get rid of me ?
SEYMOUR: No no , it 's just that I should get going in a few minutes , and
ENID: Are n't you even going to ask me how I 'm doing ?
SEYMOUR: I-I 'm sorry uh so uh how
ENID: I dunno okay , I guess I fucked that guy Josh finally
SEYMOUR: so is he your boyfriend now ?
ENID: Maybe I dunno He wants to be , of course . I 'm weighing several offers at the present time Suddenly , Dana enters .
DANA: Seymour ? uh hello I guess I 'm a little early
SEYMOUR: Dana ! Hi ! Uh , Dana this is Enid
DANA: Hello
ENID: It 's great to finally meet you ! Dana sits next to Seymour , facing Enid .
DANA: How do you two know each other ?
ENID: I 'm surprised he has n't mentioned me we 're old friends .
DANA: Really ?
ENID: Yes , we 're very close In fact , I was standing right next to Seymou the first time you called . If not for me , he would have never called you back !
DANA: Is that right ?
ENID: Oops ! Look at the time ! I 've got to un ! I 'll stop by to see you some time , Seymour It was really great to meet you !
DAD: I have some good news for you , Pumpkin .
ENID: What is it now ?
DAD: Are you still looking for a job ?
ENID: I guess .
DAD: Well , Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station . Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience , ut she thinks she can convince them .
ENID: Tell her to forget it - I do n't need her help .
DIRECTOR: I 'm afraid you 're simply going to have to take that painting down . Several of the parents have complained .
ROBERTA: I will do no such thing .
DIRECTOR: Then you leave me no other choice than to remove it myself !
ROBERTA: I think we should give the artist a chance to talk to the parents about her intentions with this piece We should be promoting discussion as a solution , not censorship . Roberta sees Margaret and grabs her .
SEYMOUR: Oh uh , hi What 's up ?
ENID: I 'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date There 's something I have to show you
SEYMOUR: I I do n't know . I do n't really think I should
ENID: Of course you should . C'mon , I 'm already a million hours late .
SEYMOUR: I better not
ENID: Well forget the art show let 's do something else .
SEYMOUR: I I wish I could , Enid , but I eally ca n't right now I it 's just that I
ENID: Well when can we do something ?
SEYMOUR: It 's just that , well , you know , Dana just got out of a really bad elationship and I do n't want to give her the wrong idea you know
JOE: Do n't mind me , I 'll just be in my oom .
ENID: Where did you get those pants ?
SEYMOUR: Oh , uh they were a present from Dana .
ENID: And you like them ?
SEYMOUR: Well , you know what do I know about clothes I 've never been the most fashionable guy it 's nice to have someone do all the work fo me
ENID: So that 's it ? You do n't ever want to see me again ?
SEYMOUR: No , of course I do It 's just that ight now I need to
ENID: What 's her problem anyway ? Did she actually tell you you could n't see me ?
SEYMOUR: No , no not exactly she just does n't understand how I would know somebody like you
ENID: What does she mean by that - `` somebody like me '' ?
SEYMOUR: Just someone so young
ENID: You must have done something to make her think you like me .
SEYMOUR: I I do n't think so .
ENID: Does that mean you do n't like me ?
SEYMOUR: No , of course not .
ENID: So , do you like me , Seymour ?
SEYMOUR: In what way do you mean ?
ENID: In whatever way you think I mean .
SEYMOUR: I do n't know I 'm sorry , but Dana 's a very jealous person . I just do n't want to screw that up right now I 'm sure she 'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends
ENID: I do n't think you understand how I eally feel about you , Seymour .

ENID: I said `` great ''
REBECCA: Oh yeah , I can tell you really love it !
ENID: Well , what am I supposed to say ? `` I ca n't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere '' ? !
REBECCA: There 's something wrong with every single place we look at ! Why do n't you just come right out and tell me you do n't want to move in with me ? !
ENID: Because you 'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it . A few passersby stop to watch .
REBECCA: You 're the psycho ! You have n't been able to deal with anything since high school ended !
ENID: You 're the one who 's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy !
REBECCA: FUCK YOU ! Have fun living with you dad for the rest of your life !
ENID: God FUCK YOU TOO !
DAD: Pumpkin ? What 's wrong ?
ENID: Nothing .
DAD: If there 's something wrong I wish you 'd tell me about it
ENID: It 's nothing it 's just some hormonal thing do n't worry about it
DAD: I 've got some important news to tell you , but it can wait till later if you 're not feeling
ENID: What ?
DAD: Well as you know , Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other , and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer , just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want .
ENID: Hi I brought over my application fo the art academy I hope it 's not too late
ROBERTA: Just a minute Then , realizing who it is
ENID: What do you mean ?
ROBERTA: The whole business with the art show and the newspaper it 's absolutely
ENID: Huh ?
ROBERTA: Did n't Principal Jaffee call you ?
ENID: I did n't check my messages
ROBERTA: Oh my goodness well , the whole thing is just ridiculous , and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I 'm going to do everything I can to help you .
ENID: Help me what ?
ROBERTA: Well they 're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class ecause of what happened at the exhibition but do n't worry I 'm sure I 'll be able to get you you diploma in the Fall !
ENID: But can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy ?
ROBERTA: I 'm sorry , Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you . I had to give it to someone else But I 'm sure next year I can
SEYMOUR: What are you doing here ?
ENID: I had to see you .
SEYMOUR: What 's up ?
ENID: Can you at least let me in ?
SEYMOUR: Uh sure come in .
ENID: Look , I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I 'll leave you alone .
SEYMOUR: What 's the matter ?
ENID: Do you have anything to drink ? Enid goes to look for herself .
SEYMOUR: Uh I think there 's some root eer
ENID: What about this ?
SEYMOUR: That 's Dana 's - I 'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary . You better not
ENID: FUCK DANA . I 'm sick of Dana .
SEYMOUR: I could never move - I 've got too much stuff .
ENID: Where did you get this ?
SEYMOUR: Dana bought it when we went antique shopping . She said it did n't go with her stuff , so she gave it to me she thought it fit in better with my `` old time thingamajigs . ''
ENID: Jesus , how can you stand her ? Seymour takes another slug off the bottle .
SEYMOUR: God , she 's going to kill me this ottle is half-empty !
ENID: That 's great ! `` Half-empty '' - that 's what I like about you , Seymour , you 're a natural pessimist !
SEYMOUR: If you expect the worst , you 're neve disappointed .
ENID: What are you talking about ? You 're disappointed every minute of you life .
SEYMOUR: I 'm just being realistic .
ENID: At least you 're not like every othe stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports they 're all such fags !
SEYMOUR: I hate sports .
ENID: How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date , you never asked me out ?
SEYMOUR: You 're a beautiful young girl I ca n't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me , except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity .
ENID: Yeah , but still it 's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that .
SEYMOUR: I mean of course I why would n't I want to go out with you ?
ENID: I dunno I always feel like everybody secretly hates me . I 'm just paranoid I guess . I mean , you like me do n't you ? We 're good friends , ight ?
SEYMOUR: Yeah , sure . Of course .
ENID: Maybe I should just move in here with you I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job .
SEYMOUR: What about Joe ?
ENID: Oh yeah and Dana You were a lot more fun before you met Dana . You 've been acting way too normal lately you 're a bitter , twisted , fucked-up guy , Seymour , that 's why I like you .
SEYMOUR: Yeah , well I like you too
ENID: You know what my number one fantasy used to be ?
SEYMOUR: What ?
ENID: I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place Do you ever think about stuff like that ?
SEYMOUR: I guess I probably used to when I was your age .
ENID: It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it , and I 'd just disappear and they 'd never see me again .
SEYMOUR: Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems .
ENID: You know what we should do ? Let 's go get in your car right now and just take off ! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life fuck everybody !
SEYMOUR: I do n't think I 'm in any condition to drive .
ENID: I 'll drive , then we 'll go out in a blaze of glory !
SEYMOUR: So where would we go ?
ENID: Who cares ? Let 's just go what 's stopping us ?
SEYMOUR: I dunno , I
ENID: I 'm serious ! I 'm just so sick of everybody ! Why ca n't I just do whatever I want ?
SEYMOUR: What do you want ?
ENID: What do you want ?
SEYMOUR: I-I-I
ENID: What 's the matter with you , Seymour ? Do n't you like me ? Be a man for once in your life !
SEYMOUR: Do you really want us to drive away somewhere ?
ENID: What ? Maybe no I dunno
SEYMOUR: I will if you want to .
ENID: No forget it
SEYMOUR: I-I never expected anything like this to happen
ENID: Yeah , well me neither
SEYMOUR: You must know I always did you eally mean all that about moving in with me ?
ENID: I was just thinking out loud I mean , you 've got this whole thing with Dana I 'm not going to let you fuck that up

SEYMOUR: Enid and I were just friends . You know we feel comfortable around each other she really likes my old records and

VENKMAN: No , that 's what I want to talk to the mayo about . We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued , screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you .
VENKMAN: Okay , I get it . But I want you to tell Lenny that , because of you , I 'm not voting for him .
JANOSZ: Still working on the Turner ? Dana jumps , startled by the intrusion .
DANA: Oh , yes , I got in a little late this morning , Janosz .
JANOSZ: You know , you are really doing very good work
DANA: Thank you , Janosz . I 've learned a lot here , ut now that my baby 's a little older , I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra .
JANOSZ: We 'll be very sorry to lose you . Perhaps I could take you to lunch today ?
DANA: Actually , I 'm not eating lunch today . I have an appointment . In fact , I 'd better go . She starts gathering up her things .
JANOSZ: Every day I ask you , and every day you 've got something else to do . Do I have bad breath or something ?
DANA: I 'm sorry . Perhaps some other time .
JANOSZ: Okay , I 'll take a raincheck on that .
DANA: and then the buggy just suddenly stopped dead in the middle of the street
DANA: Hundreds of people . Believe me , I did n't imagine this .
SPENGLER: I 'm not saying you did . In science we always look for the simplest explanation . An ASSISTANT interrupts .
ASSISTANT: We 're ready , Dr. Spengle
SPENGLER: We 'll start with the negative calibration .
DANA: What are you working on , Egon ?
SPENGLER: I 'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field . It 's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters .
DANA: Okay , whatever you think but not Venkman .
SPENGLER: Oh no .
DANA: Do you ever see him ?
SPENGLER: Occasionally
DANA: How is he these days ?
SPENGLER: Venkman ? I think he was borderline for a while there . Then he crossed the border .
DANA: Does he ever mention me ?
SPENGLER: No . Not that I can recall .
DANA: Well , we did n't part on very good terms and we sort of lost track of each other when I got married . The Assistant interrupts again .
ASSISTANT: We 're ready for the affection test .
SPENGLER: Good . Send in the puppy .
DANA: I thought of calling him after my marriage ended , but . Anyway , I appreciate you 're doing this , Egon
SPENGLER: Certainly .
DANA: Egon , I 'd rather you did n't mention any of this to Peter if you do n't mind .
SPENGLER: I wo n't .
DANA: Thank you . She shakes his hand and exits .
SPENGLER: Now let 's see how she reacts when we take away the puppy
STANTZ: Ray 's Occult .
SPENGLER: Who was that ?
STANTZ: Some crank . Looking for goat hooves . Come up with anything ?
SPENGLER: This one 's interesting . Berlin , 1939 , a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground . Three hundred eyewitnesses .
STANTZ: You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis .
SPENGLER: Good idea .
VENKMAN: Oh , hello , perhaps you could help me . I 'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request .
STANTZ: Oh , hiya , Pete .
VENKMAN: So , no goat hooves , huh ?
STANTZ: I knew that voice sounded familiar . What 's up ? How 's it going ?
VENKMAN: Nowhere fast . Why do n't you lock up and uy me a sub ?
VENKMAN: Egon !
SPENGLER: Hello , Venkman .
VENKMAN: How 've you been ? How 's teaching ? I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours , huh ?
SPENGLER: I think they 're more interested in my epididymis .
VENKMAN: I do n't even want to know where that is .
STANTZ: Oh , your book came in , Venkman . Magical Paths to Fortune and Power . He hands Venkman the book .
VENKMAN: Great . So what are you guys working on ?
VENKMAN: Who ?
STANTZ: Who ? Just someone we know .
VENKMAN: Oh , Ray He grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up .
STANTZ: Aaah ! Nobody ! I ca n't tell you !
VENKMAN: Who , Ray ?
STANTZ: Dana ! Dana Barrett !
DANA: Hi , Ray . It 's good to see you . Thanks fo coming .
STANTZ: No problem . Always glad to help and hug .
DANA: Hi , Egon .
VENKMAN: Hi , Dana .
DANA: Hello , Peter .
VENKMAN: You know , Dana , I 'm very very hurt that you did n't call me first . I 'm still into all this stuff , you know . Have n't you ever seen my show ?
DANA: I have . That 's why I did n't call you first .
VENKMAN: I can see that you 're still very bitter about us , but in the interest of science , I 'm going to give it my best shot . Let 's go to work , oys .
DANA: He did n't `` ditch '' me . We had some problems , he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it .
VENKMAN: He ditched you . You should 've married me , you know .
DANA: You never asked me , and every time I brought it up you 'd get drowsy and fall asleep .
VENKMAN: Men are very sensitive , you know . We need to feel loved and desired , too .
DANA: Well , when you started introducing me as `` the old ball and chain , '' that 's when I left .
VENKMAN: What are you going to do , Egon ? Knit him a snowsuit ?
SPENGLER: I 'd like to have a stool specimen
VENKMAN: Yeah , you would . Is that for personal o professional reasons ?
DANA: What do you think ?
VENKMAN: There 's no doubt about it . He 's got his father 's looks . The kid is ugly extremely ugly . And smelly . You stink ! It 's just horrible . You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled . What 's his name ?
DANA: His name is Oscar .
VENKMAN: Oscar ! You poor kid !
VENKMAN: Unusual ? I do n't know . I have n't had a lot of experience with babies .
DANA: I 'll do it .
VENKMAN: I 'll supervise .
STANTZ: It 's an interesting one , Pete . If anything was going on it 's totally subdued now . Spengler enters .
VENKMAN: What now , Brainiac ?
SPENGLER: I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street .
VENKMAN: Finding something abnormal on the street should n't be too hard .
DANA: We definitely had a moment or two .
VENKMAN: Okay , let 's take a look .
STANTZ: Is this the spot ?
DANA: A little to the left . Right there ! That 's where it stopped . Stantz reads the PKE meter .
STANTZ: Nothing . Not a trace .
SPENGLER: Why do n't we try the Giga-meter ?
VENKMAN: What 's that ?
STANTZ: Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts .
SPENGLER: That 's a thousand million electron volts .
VENKMAN: I knew that .
STANTZ: I think we hit the honeypot , boys . There 's something brewing under the street .
DANA: Peter , do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things .
VENKMAN: You mean like the time you got possessed and turned into a monster terror dog ? No , not a chance . Total coincidence . Am I right ?
VIGO: I , Vigo , the scourge of Carpathia , the sorrow of Moldavia , command you .
JANOSZ: Command me , lord .
VIGO: On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain , I sat on a throne of blood . What was will e , what is will be no more . Now is the season of evil . Find me a child that I might live again .
VENKMAN: I love this . We 're onto something really ig . I can smell it , Ray . We 're going to make some headlines with this one .
STANTZ: Hey , hey , hey , stresshound ! Are you nuts ? If anybody found out about this we 'd be in serious trouble . The judge could n't have een clearer - no ghostbusting .
VENKMAN: Relax . We 're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet , low key , no profile .
FIRST COP: How ya doing ?
SPENGLER: Fine ! It 's cutting fine now .
FIRST COP: Why are you cutting ?
SPENGLER: Why are we cutting ? Uh - boss !
FIRST COP: What are you doing here ?
VENKMAN: What the hell 's it look like we 're doing ? We 're bustin out asses over here 'cause some douchebag downtown ai n't got nothin ' etter to do than make idiots like us work late on a Friday night , right ?
SPENGLER: Yo . The cops seem satisfied by the explanation .
FIRST COP: Okay , boys , take it easy .
SPENGLER: You were supposed to help me with this .
VENKMAN: You need the exercise .
STANTZ: NYPRR . What the hell ? Help me lift this .
SPENGLER: Very intense . We need a deeper reading . Somebody has to go down there . Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray .
STANTZ: Thanks , boys .
SPENGLER: The New York Pneumatic Railway . It was an experimental subway system . Fan-forced air-trains , built around 1870 .
STANTZ: This is about as deep as you can go unde Manhattan without digging your own hole .
SPENGLER: What 's the reading ?
STANTZ: Off the top of the scale . This place is eally hot . Lower me to the floor .
STANTZ: Haul me up , Venkman ! Now !
SUPERVISOR: Okay , what 's the story here ?
VENKMAN: What , I got time for this ? We got three thousand phones out in the Village and about eight million miles of cable to check .
SUPERVISOR: The phone lines are over there . Venkman pops Spengler on the head .
VENKMAN: I told ya !
FIRST COP: You ai n't with Con Ed or the phone company . We checked . Tell me another one . Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment .
VENKMAN: Gas leak ?
STANTZ: Get me out of here ! !
DANA: Janosz ?
JANOSZ: Hello , Dana . I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I 'd stop by to see if everything 's all right with you you know , with the blackout and everything ? Are you okay ? Is the baby all right ?
DANA: We 're fine , Janosz .
JANOSZ: Do you need anything ? You want me to come in ?
DANA: No , everything 's fine . Honestly . Thanks anyway .
JANOSZ: Okay , just thought I 'd check . Good night , Dana . Sleep well . Do n't let the bedbugs ite you .
DANA: Good night , Janosz .
JUDGE: I want to make one thing very clear before
STANTZ: Seems like a pretty open-minded guy , huh ?
SPENGLER: His nickname is `` The Hammer . ''
LOUIS: I think you 're making a big mistake here , fellas . I do mostly tax law and some probate stuff occasionally . I got my law degree at night school .
STANTZ: That 's all right . We got arrested at night .
DANA: I wish I could stay . I feel personally esponsible for you being here .
VENKMAN: You are personally responsible . If I can get conjugal rights , will you visit me at Sing Sing ?
VENKMAN: Do n't worry about me . I 'm like a cat .
DANA: You mean you cough up hairballs all ove the rug ?
VENKMAN: I 'm El Gato . I always land on my feet .
DANA: Good luck .
VENKMAN: Thanks .
HARDEMEYER: How are you doing , hon ? Just put these guys away fast and make sure they go away for a long , long time .
HARDEMEYER: Good . Very good . The mayor and future governor wo n't forget this .
HARDEMEYER: Nice going , Venkman . Violating a judicial estraining order , willful destruction of public property , fraud , malicious mischief smooth move . See you in a couple years at your first parole hearing . Herdemeyer exits . Louis looks devastated .
LOUIS: Gee , the whole city 's against us . I think I 'm going to be sick .
PROSECUTOR: Mr. Fianella , please look at Exhibits A through F on the table over there . Do you ecognize that equipment ?
CON ED: That 's the stuff the cops found in thei truck .
PROSECUTOR: Do you know what this equipment is used for ?
CON ED: I do n't know . Catching ghosts , I guess .
PROSECUTOR: May I remind the court that the defendants are under a judicial restraining order that specifically forbids them from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators .
JUDGE: So noted .
PROSECUTOR: Now , Mr. Fianella , can you identify the substance in the jar on the table marked Exhibit F ?
CON ED: I been working underground for Con Ed fo 27 years and I never saw anything like that in my life . We checked out that tunnel the next day and we did n't find nothing . If it was down there , they must have put it there .
STANTZ: Hey , I did n't imagine it . There must have een ten thousand gallons of it down there .
SPENGLER: It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source .
LOUIS: Should I say that ?
SPENGLER: I doubt that they 'd believe us . Louis moans and goes back to his notes .
LOUIS: So like you were just trying to help out your old friend because she was scared and you did n't really mean to do anything bad and you really love the city and wo n't eve do anything like this again , right ?
PROSECUTOR: Objection , your Honor . He 's leading the witness .
JUDGE: The witness is leading him . Sustained .
LOUIS: Okay , let me rephrase that question . Did n't you once coach a basketball team fo underprivileged children ?
VENKMAN: Yes , I did . We were city champs .
PROSECUTOR: Objection . Irrelevant and immaterial .
JUDGE: Sustained . Mr. Tully , do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some earing on this case ?
LOUIS: Do I ?
LOUIS: No , I guess not . Your witness .
PROSECUTOR: So , Dr. Venkman , please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street .
VENKMAN: Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we did n't think anyone would notice .
JUDGE: Keep that up , mister , and I 'll find you in contempt .
VENKMAN: Sorry , your Honor , but when somebody sets me up like that I ca n't resist .
PROSECUTOR: I 'll ask you again , Dr. Venkman . Why were you digging the hole ? And please remembe that you 're under oath .
VENKMAN: I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in , but I 'm going to tell you the truth . There are things in this world that go way eyond human understanding , things that ca n't be explained and that most people do n't want to know about anyway . That 's where we come in .
PROSECUTOR: So what are you saying ? That the world of the supernatural is your special province ?
VENKMAN: No , I guess I 'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it .
JUDGE: Does the counsel for the defense wish to make any final arguements ? Louis rises .
LOUIS: Your honor , may I approach the bench ?
JUDGE: Yes . Louis crosses to the judge 's bench .
LOUIS: Can I have some of your water ?
JUDGE: Get on with it , counselor !
LOUIS: Your honor , ladies and gentlemen of the audience . I do n't think it 's fair to call my clients frauds . Okay , the blackout was a big problem for everybody . I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time , but I do n't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me . Thank you .
SPENGLER: Way to go . Concise and to the point .
LOUIS: Did I forget something ?
JUDGE: That was unquestionably the worst presentation of a case I 've ever heard in a court of law ! I ought to cite you fo contempt and have you disbarred . As fo your clients , Peter Venkman , Raymond Stantz and Egon Spengler , on the charges of conspiracy , fraud and the willful destruction of public property , I find you guilty on all counts . I order you to pay fines in the amount of $ 25,000 each and I sentence you to eighteen months in the city correctional facility at Ryker 's Island .
JUDGE: And on a more personal note , let me go on ecord as saying that there is no place in decent society for fakes , charlatans and tricksters like you who prey on the gullibility of innocent people . You 're eneath the contempt of this court . And elieve me , if my hands were not tied by the unalterable fetters of the law , a law which has become in my view far too permissive and inadequate in it 's standards of punishment , I would invoke the tradition of ou illustrious forebearers , reach back to a sterner , purer justice and have you burned at the stake !
STANTZ: Under the table , boys !
VENKMAN: Who are they ?
JUDGE: They 're the Scoleri Brothers . I tried them for murder . They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48 . Now they want to kill me .
VENKMAN: Maybe they just want to appeal .
VENKMAN: These boys are n't playing around .
JUDGE: You 've got to stop them . Please !
LOUIS: Violating a judicial restraining order could expose my clients to serious criminal penalties . As their attorney I 'd have to advise them against it .
STANTZ: Let 's go to work , boys .
VENKMAN: Geez , I forgot how heavy these things are .
STANTZ: Okay , let 's heat 'em up !
VENKMAN: Hey ! Why do n't you pick on someone your own size ?
STANTZ: On my signal , boys . Open 'em up Now !
VENKMAN: Spengs , take the door . Ray , let 's try and work them down and into the corner .
STANTZ: Watch it ! I 'm coming under you , Pete .
VENKMAN: Occupado .
SPENGLER: Brilliant summation .
VENKMAN: Case closed , boys . We 're back in business . The spectators cheer and applaud .
LOUIS: What is it , honey ?
JANINE: It 's that darn ghost again ! I do n't know what to do anymore . He just wo n't leave us alone . I guess we 'll just have to move .
LOUIS: Do n't worry . We 're not moving . He is . He picks up the phone .
JANINE: Who are you going to call ?
LOUIS: Ghostbusters .
STANTZ: I 'm Ray
VENKMAN: I 'm Peter
SPENGLER: I 'm Egon
STANTZ: And we 're the
ALL: Ghostbusters .
STANTZ: That 's right Ghostbusters . We 're back and we 're better than ever with twice the know-how and twice the particle-power to deal with all your supernatural elimination needs .
TO CAMERA: And to celebrate our grand reopening , we 're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back ' service plan .
VENKMAN: Hold on , Ray ! Half-price ! Have you gone crazy ?
STANTZ: I guess so , Pete , because that 's not all . Tell them what else we 've got , Egon .
SPENGLER: You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids ?
STANTZ: You bet .
ALL: Ready to believe you .
LOUIS: Oh , geez , smells like somebody took a really ig He freezes .
VENKMAN: You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes ?
STANTZ: If he was n't dead he 'd be an Olympic prospect .
LOUIS: Uh-oh . He slinks off , defeated .
VENKMAN: I 'm looking for Dana Barrett .
SECURITY GUARD: Room 304 Restorations . Hey ! Dr. Venkman 'World of the Psychic . ' I 'm a big , big fan . That used to be one of my two favorite shows .
VENKMAN: Thanks . What 's the other one ?
SECURITY GUARD: 'Bass Masters . ' It 's a fishing show . Eve see it ?
VENKMAN: Yeah , really great . Take it easy . He exits .
DANA: Oh , hello , Peter .
VENKMAN: You 're really good , you know .
DANA: I did n't paint it . I 'm just cleaning it . It 's an original Ver Meer . It 's worth about ten million dollars .
DANA: I 'm sure you did n't come here just to talk about art .
VENKMAN: As a matter of fact , I stopped by to tell you that I have n't forgotten your problem and that we 're still on the case .
JANOSZ: Dana , are n't you going to introduce me to your friend ?
DANA: Oh , I 'm sorry . This is Peter Venkman . Peter , Janosz Poha .
JANOSZ: Pleasure to meet you . I 've seen you on television .
VENKMAN: How are you ? What 's that you 're working on , Johnny ?
JANOSZ: It 's a painting I 'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition . It 's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo , the Carpathian . He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century .
VENKMAN: Too bad for the Moldavians .
JANOSZ: He was a very powerful magician . A genius in many ways and quite a skilled painter .
DANA: He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman . I hate this painting . I 've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage .
VENKMAN: Yeah , it 's not the kind of thing you 'd want to hang in the rec room . You know what it needs ? A fluffy little white kitten in the corner .
JANOSZ: We do n't go around altering valuable paintings , Dr. Venkman .
VENKMAN: Well , I 'd make an exception in this case if I were you . Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman .
JANOSZ: My pleasure . Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace .
VENKMAN: I may be wrong , but I think you 've got a little crush on this guy .
DANA: Good-bye , Peter .
VENKMAN: I 'd like to stay , but I really do n't have time to hang around here . I 'll call you . Later , Johnny ! He exits .
STANTZ: Oh good , you 're here . Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you .
VENKMAN: It 's not that thing you do with you nostrils , is it ?
STANTZ: We 've been studying the stuff that we took from the subway tunnel .
VENKMAN: And now you 're going to eat it ?
STANTZ: You foul , obnoxious muck ! !
VENKMAN: This is what you do with your spare time ?
STANTZ: This is an incredible breakthrough , Venkman . A psychoreactive substance ! Whatever this is , it clearly responds to human emotional states .
VENKMAN: 'Mood slime . ' We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it .
SPENGLER: We 've found it at every event site we 've een to lately .
WINSTON: You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes ' ?
STANTZ: Like a goat on garbage .
VENKMAN: What kind of tests ?
STANTZ: Well , we sing to it , we talk to it , we say supportive , nurturing things
VENKMAN: You 're not sleeping with this stuff , are you ? Spengler reacts as if he might be .
STANTZ: It really responds to music . Let 's calm it down .
WINSTON: Does it have any favorites ?
STANTZ: It likes all the sappy stuff 'Cumbaya , ' 'Everything is Beautiful , ' 'It 's a Small World ' but it loves Jackie Wilson .
WINSTON: Right , and the first time someone gets mad , their toaster will eat their hand .
VENKMAN: So we 'll put a warning on the label .
DANA: Look at you . I think we got more food on your shirt than we got in your mouth .
VENKMAN: No , I just got in a couple hours ago . Come on in . Are we having a pajama party ?
DANA: Peter , the bathtub tried to eat Oscar . Venkman looks at her for a long moment .
VENKMAN: You know , if anyone else told me that , I 'd have serious doubts . But coming from you , I ca n't honestly say I 'm surprised .
DANA: I must be losing my mind . At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me .
VENKMAN: Who could blame him ? Were you wearing this nightgown ?
DANA: I do n't know what to do anymore .
VENKMAN: I 'll get Ray and Egon to check out the athtub . You better stay here .
DANA: Peter , what about the bathtub ?
VENKMAN: We 'll take care of that . Ray , Pete . Listen , get over to Dana 's right away Her bathtub pulled a fast one tried to eat the kid .
DANA: It was full of this awful pink ooze .
VENKMAN: Sounds like another slime job No , they 're all right . They 're here now Right Let me know . He hangs up .
DANA: Peter , this is very nice , but you do n't have to do any of this , you know .
VENKMAN: Be careful on that sofa it 's a butt-biter . But the bed 's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired , feel free . In fact , I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here .
DANA: Really ? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements ?
VENKMAN: For me it 's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me . If we go the other way I 'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night .
DANA: How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby .
VENKMAN: Or we could do that .
DANA: Thank you . Poor baby . I think I should put him down now .
VENKMAN: I 'll put him down for you . You are way too short ! And your belly-button sticks out ! You 're nothing but a burden to your poor mother !
STANTZ: Nothing . Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub . But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo characte you mentioned . I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger 's Magicians , Martyrs and Madmen . Listen to this
VENKMAN: A hundred and five years ? He really hung on , did n't he .
STANTZ: And he did n't die of old age either . He was poisoned , stabbed , shot , hung , stretched , disemboweled , drawn and quartered .
WINSTON: I guess he was n't too popular at the end there .
SPENGLER: No , not exactly a man of the people . `` Also known as Vigo the Cruel , Vigo the Torturer , Vigo the Despised , and Vigo the Unholy . ''
STANTZ: This guy was a bad monkey . He dabbled in all the Black Arts , and listen to this prophecy . Just before his head died , his last words were , `` Death is but a door , time is but a window . I 'll be back . ''
VENKMAN: That 's it ? `` I 'll be back ? ''
SPENGLER: It 's a rough translation from the Moldavian .
RUDY: Hey , Dr. Venkman . What 's going on ?
VENKMAN: We 're just going up to Restorations for a minute .
RUDY: Oh , I ca n't let you do that . Mr. Poha told me not to let you up there anymore .
VENKMAN: Okay , we were trying to keep this quiet but I think you can be trusted . Tell him , Ray .
STANTZ: Mister , you have an Ecto-paritic , subfusionary flux in this building .
RUDY: We got a flux ?
WINSTON: You got a flux and a half .
STANTZ: Now if you do n't want to be the fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift , I suggest you get down ehind that desk and do n't move until we give you the signal `` Stabilize All Clear . ''
JANOSZ: Dr. Venkman ? Dana is not here .
VENKMAN: I know .
JANOSZ: Then why have you come ?
VENKMAN: We got a major creep alert and we 're just going down the list . Your name was first .
STANTZ: Let 's sweep it , boys .
VENKMAN: You know , I never got to ask you . Where you from , Johnny ?
JANOSZ: The Upper West Side .
SPENGLER: This entire room is extremely hot , Peter .
VENKMAN: We 'll know when we find it . You just sit tight . This wo n't take long .
VENKMAN: This is the one that looked at Dana .
JANOSZ: It must be the chemical fumes in the studio . People start imagining things
VENKMAN: I 'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory . If she says it looked at her , it looked at her . Hey , you ! Vigie ! Look at me . I 'm talking to you . Hey ! Look at me when I 'm talking to you .
VENKMAN: Beautiful , beautiful . Work with me , baby . Just have fun with it . Okay , he 's playing it cool . Let 's finish up and get out of here .
STANTZ: I 'll get one more reading .
WINSTON: Now that 's one ugly dude .
STANTZ: Huh ? What ?
WINSTON: You finished here ?
STANTZ: What ? Yeah .
WINSTON: Are you all right ? You coming down with something ?
STANTZ: No , I 'm fine . I just got light-headed fo a second there . Let 's go . They head for the door .
VENKMAN: Not . Do n't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities . We 'll be back . They exit .
SPENGLER: There 's definitely something going on in that studio . The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red .
WINSTON: I 'd put my money on that Vigo character .
VENKMAN: Yeah , that 's a safe bet . You and Spengman see what else you can dig up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha . Those two were made for each other .
STANTZ: Idiot ! Move it , you jerk ! Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks .
WINSTON: Going a little fast , are n't we , Ray ? Stantz turns on him .
STANTZ: Are you telling me how to drive ?
WINSTON: No , I just thought
STANTZ: Well do n't think !
WINSTON: Are you crazy , man ? You 're going to kill somebody ! Stantz looks at him and smile demonically .
STANTZ: No , I 'm going to kill everybody ! He swerves off the road .
VENKMAN: You just picked up three penalty points on your driver 's license .
WINSTON: Are you all right ?
STANTZ: Yeah , I guess so . It was the strangest thing . I knew what I was doing but I could n't stop . This really terrible feeling came over me and I do n't know I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all . Whew ! Sorry , boys . They inspect the damage to the car .
VENKMAN: Watch him , Egon . Do n't even let him shave .
DANA: Yes , I 'm very clean . Did they find anything at my apartment ?
VENKMAN: Nothing . They stayed there all night , went through your personal stuff , made a bunch of long-distance phone calls and cleaned out your refrigerator . And did n't find anything . Dana opens the bedroom door .
DANA: They did n't find anything ? In the bathtu the pink ooze nothing ? So , what do I do now ?
VENKMAN: Now you get dressed and we go out . I got a abysitter and everything . Trust me , you need it .
DANA: I 'm not here to date . I ca n't leave Osca in a strange place with someone I do n't know .
VENKMAN: It 's Janine Melnitz , from my staff . She 's one of my most valuable employees .
DANA: Does she know anything about babies ?
VENKMAN: Janine Melnitz , are you kidding ? Do I have a vase ? I brought some of you clothes . Wear something intriguing . I ought along some interesting possibilities .
DANA: Okay , but it 's not a date . It 's a dinner .
VENKMAN: Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here ?
LOUIS: Okay , Stinky , this is it . Showdown time . You and me , pal . You think you 're smarte than I am ? We 'll see about that . Oh , hello , Pizza Man ! Oh , two larges ! I only ordered one . Oh , pepperoni and pineapple . My absolute favorite . I guess I 'll have to eat these both by myself .
LOUIS: Oh migod ! I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to do that . It was an accident .
JANINE: What are you doing up here ?
LOUIS: I was trying to get that smelly green thing . The guys asked me to help out . I 'm like the fifth Ghostbuster .
JANINE: Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you 're already an accountant ?
LOUIS: Oh , no , it 's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt .
JANINE: Have you made any plans yet ? You know tomorrow is New Year 's Eve .
LOUIS: No , I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first . That way I beat the crowds .
JANINE: That 's very practical . I hate going out on New Year 's Eve , too .
LOUIS: Janine , do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home ?
JANINE: I 'd like to , but I told Dr. Venkman I 'd abysit . Do you want to babysit with me ?
LOUIS: Oh , sure , that sounds great . They exit .
VENKMAN: Do n't tell me , let me guess . All-you-can-eat arbecue rib night at the Sizzler ?
STANTZ: We 're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow . We thought you might want to come along .
VENKMAN: Darn it ! I wish I 'd known you were going .
SPENGLER: You know , animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters . Given the new
VENKMAN: Roach breeding ? Sounds better and better . Dana ? The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime . Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big oach-breeding surge . Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead ?
STANTZ: Wow . Dana looks curiously at their outfits .
DANA: Hi . They nod and wave back .
VENKMAN: I think we 're going to have to pass on the sewer trip , boys . Let me know what you find out .
STANTZ: Okay , but you 're missing all the fun .
SPENGLER: Six feet seven eight
STANTZ: That 's it . It 's on the bottom .
SPENGLER: Nine feet ten
WINSTON: Is the line sinking ?
SPENGLER: No , the slime is rising .
STANTZ: Let 's get out of here , boys .
VENKMAN: Here 's to us . She sighs and drinks .
DANA: I want to stop getting involved with men who are n't good for me .
VENKMAN: Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow , or could you hold off for a few days maybe ?
DANA: For one night in your life , do you think it 's possible for us to be completely real ?
VENKMAN: All right , you want to be real ? So tell me why did you dump me ?
DANA: Oh , Peter , I did n't dump you . I just had to protect myself . You really were n't very good for me , you know .
VENKMAN: I 'm not even good for me .
DANA: Why do you say things like that ? You 're so much better than you know .
VENKMAN: Thank you . If I had that kind of support on a daily basis , I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century .
DANA: So why do n't you give me a jingle in the year 2000 ?
VENKMAN: Let me jingle you right now . He leans over to kiss her .
DANA: Maybe I should call Janine .
VENKMAN: Do n't worry . Janine has a very special way with children . They kiss .
JANINE: I ca n't believe a person could actually live like this .
LOUIS: So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a eautiful princess came to live with them .
JANINE: It 's really not a bad place . It just needs a woman 's touch .
LOUIS: So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services , which was a good deal for all of them because then they did n't have to withhold tax and social security , which I 'm not saying is right but it 's just a story , so I guess it 's all right . I can finish this later if you 're tired .
JANINE: You 're really good with children , Louis . I can tell . Why do n't you come here and sit with me ?
LOUIS: Okay . He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa .
JANINE: Motherhood is a very natural instinct fo me . I 'd like to have a baby myself . Would n't you ?
LOUIS: Tonight ?
WINSTON: Nice going , Ray ! What were you trying to do drown me ?
STANTZ: Look , Zeddemore , it was n't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line .
WINSTON: You better watch your mouth , man , or I 'll punch your lights out .
STANTZ: Oh yeah ? Anytime , anytime . Just go ahead and try it .
SPENGLER: If you two are looking for a fight , you got one . Who wants it first ? Come on , Ray . Try me , sucker .
STANTZ: Butt out , you pencil-necked geek . I 've had it with you .
SPENGLER: Strip ! Right now ! Get out of those clothes !
WINSTON: What are we doing ? Ray , I was ready to kill you .
STANTZ: Do n't you see ? It 's the slime . That stuff is like pure , concentrated evil .
SPENGLER: And it 's all flowing right to this spot .
MAITRE D': Can I help you ? Stantz looks around and spots Venkman .
STANTZ: That 's all right , I see him .
STANTZ: You should 've been there , Venkman . Absolutely incredible !
VENKMAN: Yeah , sorry I missed it . I guess you guys did n't know about the dress code here . It 's really kind of a coat and tie place .
STANTZ: It 's all over the city , Pete well , unde it actually .
WINSTON: Rivers of the stuff !
SPENGLER: And it 's all flowing toward the museum .
STANTZ: Sorry !
DANA: Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else .
VENKMAN: Boys , listen . You 're scaring the straights . Let 's save this until tomorrow , okay ?
SPENGLER: This wo n't wait until tomorrow , Venkman . It 's hot and it 's ready to pop .
COP: Hey ! It 's the Ghostbusters . You 're out of uniform , gentlemen
STANTZ: Uh well we had a little accident , but forget that . We have to see the mayor as soon as possible .
COP: Look , Doc , why do n't you just go home . You 'll get a good night 's sleep and then you can give the mayor a call in the morning . Come on .
STANTZ: We 're not going anywhere with you . I told you we have to see the mayor now .
COP: I 'm warning you . You can come along peaceably or
VENKMAN: Hey , do n't be an idiot . This is serious .
COP: Look , pal , keep this up and you 're going with them .
VENKMAN: Oh , yeah ?
COP: Yeah , let 's go . You 're all under arrest .
VENKMAN: Finish your dessert it 's already paid for . I 'll call you .
SPENGLER: Look , we 're not drunk and we 're not crazy . This is a matter of vital importance .
COP: What are you doing ?
VENKMAN: I just want to get your names right for when the mayor asks us why we did n't let him know about this sooner .
COP: Okay , Doc . You want to see the mayor , you got it . Follow us . They head for their respective vehicles .
LOUIS: Oh , hello , Dana . we were just we were
DANA: I know what you were doing , Louis . It 's all right .
JANINE: How was your date ?
DANA: Typical . Peter was arrested . Has he called ?
LOUIS: No , nobody called . Dana frowns .
DANA: Is everything all right with Oscar ?
JANINE: Oh , he 's fine . He 's such a good baby . He was a little fussy at first , but we gave him a Freach bread pizza and he went right to sleep .
DANA: Oh , good . I 'll just check on him . She crosses to the bedroom .
LOUIS: Should we go ?
JANINE: I do n't think we should leave her alone .
LOUIS: You 're right . We should stay .
VIGO: I , Vigo , the scourge of Carpathia
JANOSZ: Yes , the scourge
VIGO: the sorrow of Moldavia
JANOSZ: the sorrow
VIGO: I command you .
JANOSZ: I await the word of Vigo .
VIGO: The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year . Bring me the child that I might live again .
JANOSZ: Lord Vigo , the mother , Dana , is fine and strong . I was wondering well , would it e possible if I bring the baby , could I have the woman ?
VIGO: So be it . On this the day of darkness , she will be ours , wife to you and mother to me .
MAYOR: All right the Ghostbusters . I 'll tell you right now ; I 've got two hundred of the heaviest campaign contributors in the city out there eating bad roast chicken waiting for me to give the speech of my life . You 've got two minutes . Make it good .
STANTZ: You get enough negative energy flowing in a dense environment like Manhattan , it starts to build up , and if we do n't do something fast this whole place will blow like a frog on a hotplate .
WINSTON: Tell him about the toaster .
VENKMAN: I do n't think he 's ready for the toaster .
MAYOR: Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker 's God-given ight . What am I supposed to do go on television and tell eight million people they have to be nice to each other ? I 'm sorry , none of this makes any sense to me , and if anything does happen we 've got plenty of paid professionals to deal with it . You two minutes are up . Good night , gentlemen .
HARDEMEYER: That 's quite a story .
VENKMAN: Yeah , I think the Times might be interested , do n't you ? The Post might have a lot of fun with it , too . Hardemeyer 's eyes go cold and calculating .
HARDEMEYER: Before you go running to the newspapers with this , would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown ?
VENKMAN: Now you 're talking .
WINSTON: I 'm telling you , we 're not crazy . He is !
PSYCHIATRIST: We 'll do whatever 's necessary .
DANA: You know you really do n't have to stay . Peter should be back soon .
LOUIS: Oh no , we do n't mind .
DANA: Excuse me . I think Oscar is up . She crosses to the bedroom .
LOUIS: Where 're you going ?
DANA: To get my baby back .
STANTZ: We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian is alive in a painting at the Manhattan Museum .
PSYCHIATRIST: I see . And are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them ?
SPENGLER: You 're wasting valuable time ! We have reason to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from a psychomagnetheric slime flow that 's been collecting under the city .
PSYCHIATRIST: Yes , tell me about the slime .
WINSTON: It 's potent stuff . We made a toaster dance with it , then a bathtub tried to eat his friend 's baby . The psychiatrist looks at Venkman .
VENKMAN: Do n't look at me . I think they 're nuts .
DANA: What do you want with my baby ?
JANOSZ: No harm will come to the child . You might even say it 's a privilege . He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo . And you well , you will be the mother of the rule of the world . Does n't that sound nice ?
DANA: If this is what the world will be like , I do n't want to live in it .
JANOSZ: I do n't believe we have the luxury of choice .
DANA: Everybody has a choice .
JANOSZ: Not in this case , my dear . Take a look . That 's not Gainsborough 's Blue Boy up there . He 's Vigo !
DANA: I do n't care who he is . He 's not taking my aby .
JANOSZ: You will see . It 's all for the best .
STANTZ: This is it . boys . It 's starting . Shit-storm
VENKMAN: It better not start yet . I 'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch .
WINSTON: You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true ?
PATIENT: 1997 . My dog told me .
VENKMAN: What kind of dog ?
PATIENT: Labrador .
VENKMAN: Habitual liars . They ca n't help it . It 's in the breed .
LOUIS: Come on , Sherm . You 're my cousin . Do this for me . I 'm begging you .
SHERMAN: I ca n't do it , Louis . It is n't ethical . I could lose my license .
LOUIS: Why ca n't you just have them released ? You 're a doctor .
SHERMAN: I 'm a dermatologist . I ca n't write orders on the psych ward .
LOUIS: Sherman , I 've done lots of favors for you .
SHERMAN: Like what ?
LOUIS: I got you out of those bad tax shelters .
SHERMAN: You were the one who got me in .
LOUIS: I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out , did n't she ?
SHERMAN: Yeah , I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year . Forget it , Louis . I could get in a lot of trouble .
LOUIS: I 'm telling you , we 're all going to be in ig trouble if we do n't do something fast . That ghost guy came and took my friend 's aby and we got to get it back . It 's just a scared little baby , Sherm .
SHERMAN: Then you should go to the police . I do n't elieve in any of that stuff . Sherman looks out the window .
LOUIS: Do you believe it now , Sherm ?
WOMAN: I told you we should have stayed in Palm Beach . The weather here gets stranger every year .
MAN: Yes , dear .
DETECTIVE ONE: Look , lady , of course there are dead people there . It 's a cemetery They were asking you for directions ?
DETECTIVE TWO: Was this a big dinosaur or a little dinosaur ? Oh , just the skeleton , huh ? Well , where is it now ?
DETECTIVE THREE: Wait a second the park bench was chasing you ? You mean , someone was chasing you in the park No , the bench itself was chasing you . I see A weary SERGEANT answers a RINGING PHONE .
SERGEANT: Manhattan Central , Flaherty speaking Yeah yeah ? What ? Who is this ? Wait a second .
LIEUTENANT: What is it ? I 'm talkin ' here !
SERGEANT: It 's some dock supervisor down at Pier 34 on the Hudson . The guy 's going nuts .
LIEUTENANT: What 's the problem ?
SERGEANT: He says the Titanic just arrived .
STANTZ: Good work , Louis . How did you get us out ?
LOUIS: Oh , I pulled a few strings . I would n't want to say any more than that . Louis winks conspiratorially at Sherman .
SHERMAN: Hi , it 's really great to meet you guys . I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed , but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that
LOUIS: Hey ! Wait ! Okay , I 'll meet you there .
LOUIS: I let them handle all the little stuff . I just come in on the big ones .
VENKMAN: Yeah , well guess again .
LOUIS: I brought everything you asked for and I gassed up the car with Super Unleaded . It cost twenty cents more than Regular Unleaded ut you get much better performance and in an old car like this that 'll end up saving you money in the long run . I put it on my credit card , so you can either reimburse me or I can take it out of petty cash
STANTZ: It looks like a giant Jello mold .
VENKMAN: I hate Jello .
STANTZ: Okay , give it a rest , Captain . We 'll take it from here .
FIRE CAPTAIN: Be my guest . We been cutting here for three hours . What the hell 's going on ? You know the Titanic arrived this morning ?
VENKMAN: Well , better late than never .
SPENGLER: Full neutronas , maser assist .
STANTZ: Throw 'em !
VENKMAN: Okay , who knows `` Cumbaya ? ''
ALL: Cumbaya , milord , cumbaya , Cumbaya , milord , cumbaya , Oh , Lord , cumbaya .
STANTZ: Forget it . The Vienna Boys Choir could n't get through this stuff .
VENKMAN: Good effort . Now what ? Should we say supportive , nurturing things to it , Ray ?
SPENGLER: It wo n't work . There 's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell .
STANTZ: I ca n't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there 's no way back . Sure , it 's crowded , it 's dirty , it 's noisy . And there are too many people who 'd just as soon step on your face as look at you . But there 've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg . We just have to mobilize it .
SPENGLER: We need something that everyone can get ehind , a symbol
STANTZ: Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us
SPENGLER: Something good
VENKMAN: And pure
WINSTON: And decent .
HARDEMEYER: Look , I 've had it with you . Get your stuff together , get back in that clown car and get out of here . This is a city matter and everything 's under control .
VENKMAN: Oh , you think so ? Well , I 've got news fo you . You 've got Dracula 's brother-in-law in there and he 's got my girlfriend and he kid . Around about midnight tonight , when you 're partying uptown , this guy 's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants . And that 's just round one .
MAYOR: Are you telling me there 're people trapped in there ?
HARDEMEYER: This is dynamite . Call A.P. , U.P.I. , and C.N.N . and get them down here right away . When the police bring this kid out I want them to hand it right to the mayor and I want it all on camera .
STANTZ: Mr. Mayor , if we do n't do something by midnight , you 're going to go down in history as the man who let New York get sucked down into the tenth level of hell . The Mayor stops to consider the situation .
MAYOR: Can you get into that museum ?
FIRE CAPTAIN: If I had a nuclear warhead , maybe . The Mayor turns to Venkman .
MAYOR: You know why all these things are happening ?
VENKMAN: We tried to tell you last night , but Mr. Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony in . Hardemeyer flips out .
HARDEMEYER: This is preposterous ! You ca n't seriously elieve all this mumbo-jumbo ! It 's the Twentieth Century , for crying out loud ! Look , mister , I do n't know what this stuff is or how you got it all over the museum , ut you better get it off and I mean right now !
MAYOR: Okay , just tell me what you need .
VENKMAN: Kind of makes you wonder , does n't it ?
WINSTON: Wonder what ?
VENKMAN: If she 's naked under that toga . She 's French , you know .
SPENGLER: There 's nothing under that toga but 300 tons of iron and steel . Stantz is looking worried .
STANTZ: I hope we have enough stuff to do the job .
VENKMAN: Only one way to find out . Ready , Teddy ? They enter the statue .
STANTZ: Okay , boys . Let 's frost it .
JANINE: I 'm not sure this is such a good idea ? Do they know you 're doing this ?
LOUIS: Oh , yeah , sure no . But there 's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum .
JANINE: You 're very brave , Louis . Good luck .
LOUIS: Uh oh well , I better hurry . He rushes out .
VENKMAN: Okay , one , two , three , four
STANTZ: She 's moving !
WINSTON: I 've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty . Now I finally get here and we 're taking her out for a walk .
SPENGLER: We 've got full power .
VENKMAN: Okay , Libby . Let 's get it in gear .
WINSTON: How deep does it get ? That water 's cold and I ca n't swim .
VENKMAN: It 's okay . I have my Senior Lifesaving card .
SPENGLER: With a water temperature of forty degrees we 'd survive approximately fifteen minutes . Stantz studies a maritime navigational chart .
STANTZ: I 'll keep to the middle of the channel . We 're okay to 59th Street , then we 'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th .
VENKMAN: Are you kidding ? We 'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th . I 'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth . Trust me , I used to drive a cab .
JANOSZ: Time is running out , Dana . Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine and Vigo 's . Well , mainly Vigo 's . But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship .
DANA: We do n't have a relationship .
JANOSZ: I know . Marry me , Dana , and together we will raise Vigo as our son . There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god . I 'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment . And perhaps a ca and free parking .
DANA: I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul . I could never forgive what you 've done to me and my child .
JANOSZ: Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance , but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other . Think about it .
DANA: I 'd rather not .
SPENGLER: It 's working . The positive GeV 's are climbing .
VENKMAN: They love you , Lib . Keep it up .
SPENGLER: I 'm worried . The vibrations could shake he to pieces . We should have padded her feet .
STANTZ: I do n't think they make Nikes in her size .
VENKMAN: We 're almost there , Lib . Step on it .
STANTZ: My Fault !
VENKMAN: She 's new in town .
CROWD: Ten .. nine eight seven
VIGO: Soon my life begins . Then woe to the weak , all power to me , the world is mine .
VENKMAN: Happy New Year .
SPENGLER: Hi there . Feel free to try something stupid .
JANOSZ: You pitiful , miserable creatures ! You dare to challenge the power of darkness ? Do n't you realize what you are dealing with ? He 's Vigo ! You are like the buzzing of flies to him .
VENKMAN: Oh , Johnny . Did you back the wrong horse .
STANTZ: Vigi , Vigi , Vigi you have been a bad little monkey .
VENKMAN: The whole city 's together on this one . We took a vote . Everybody 's down on you , you know .
WINSTON: Say goodnight now .
SPENGLER: Do n't shoot ! You 'll hit Ray !
STANTZ: Do it ! Just do it ! Winston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray .
SPENGLER: He 's breathing .
WINSTON: Ray Ray How do you feel , man ?
STANTZ: Groovy . I 've never felt better in my life .
VENKMAN: Oh , no . We 've got to live with this ? They pull him to his feet .
STANTZ: I love you guys . You 're the best friends I 've ever had .
VENKMAN: Hey , I just had this suit cleaned . Take care of the wiggler , will you .
DANA: I think he likes you . I think I do too .
VENKMAN: Finally came to your senses , huh ? They hug and kiss .
JANOSZ: What happened ?
STANTZ: Sir , you had a violent , prolonged , transformative psychic episode . But it 's over now . Want a coffee ?
JANOSZ: That 's very kind of you .
SPENGLER: He 's fine , Ray . Physically intact , psychomagnetherically neutral .
JANOSZ: Is that good ?
WINSTON: It 's where you want to be .
SPENGLER: Late Renaissance , I think . Caravaggio o Brunelleschi .
WINSTON: There 's something very familiar about this painting .
LOUIS: Okay , so Monday night we 'll get something to eat and maybe go bowling ? Can you bowl with those little arms ?
STANTZ: No , you 're right on time .
HARDEMEYER: Happy New Year , everybody ! He joins in on `` Auld Lang Syne . ''
VENKMAN: She 's all right . She 's just sleeping it off .
MAYOR: We just had it restored .
VENKMAN: This probably is n't a good time to bring this up , but the last time we did a job fo the city you stiffed us .
STANTZ: This is a bill for tonight 's job .
MAYOR: What ! This is way too much . We wo n't pay . Venkman looks at the Statue .
VENKMAN: I think she looks pretty good here , do n't you ?
MAYOR: All right , all right . If you can wait until Monday I 'll issue you a check .
SPENGLER: Sorry . No checks . Company policy .
VENKMAN: Pretty impressive , huh ?
SPENGLER: It 's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country .
VENKMAN: From where Neptune ?
SPENGLER: They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland .
VENKMAN: Ostrov ? I 've been there . Good party town .
STANTZ: My great-grandparents were Swiss . I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived .
VENKMAN: Oh , right , you told me that . They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese , as I ecall . How about you , Winston ?
WINSTON: My people were n't taking any pictures from those slave ships , man . And there was n't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them , either . What are you , Dana ?
VENKMAN: Miss Blue Blood ? Her family 's been here since the year 12 .
DANA: That 's not true . It was 1620 .
VENKMAN: Same difference .
STANTZ: What 's your story , Pete ?
VENKMAN: Me ? I 'm a little of everything . Some Irish , some German , some French , Dutch the women in my family slept around . And that 's what made this country great .
DANA: That 's a terrible thing to say .
VENKMAN: So what ? It 's a free country . Thanks , Lib . They all look up at the Statue .
GINGER: Brigitte . Quit dickin ' around . Jus ' do it .

FRODE: He 's - excuse me ?
SALANDER: He 's honest . He 's who he presents himself to be . In his business , that 's an asset .
FRODE: There 's less in his asset column after his conviction today .
SALANDER: That 's true . He made a fool of himself with that . If it happened that way .
FRODE: Are you saying he was set up ?
SALANDER: That was n't part of my assignment .
FRODE: You 're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally . How big of a fool did he make of himself financially ?
SALANDER: The judgement will just about empty his savings .
FRODE: Your report is light in anothe area . His personal life . Anything you chose not to include ?
SALANDER: Nothing that warranted inclusion .
FRODE: I 'm not sure if that means yes or no .
ARMANSKY: I think what Ms. Salander means , and I agree , is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy , even when they 're being investigated .
FRODE: Not in this case . I have to know if there 's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she does n't .
SALANDER: He 's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor . It wrecked his marriage , but not hers . Her husband accepts it . Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist 's , sometimes at home .
FRODE: You were right not to include that .
SALANDER: I know .
FRODE: Anything else ?
SALANDER: No .
FRODE: Please think before you say no .
SALANDER: I did .
FRODE: I do n't want to be surprised by something later . Salander offers nothing more .
SALANDER: He likes sandwiches .
ERIKA: Usually when I wake up in a cold ed , it 's at home .
BLOMKVIST: Sorry .
ERIKA: What are you doing ?
BLOMKVIST: Writing the press release .
ERIKA: Saying -
BLOMKVIST: You 're taking over as publisher . You 're sorry for any nuisance Wennerstrom was caused . I ca n't be eached for comment .
ERIKA: You 're giving up .
BLOMKVIST: Just taking a few steps aside . For you .
ERIKA: This makes me sick .
GREGER: You needed a better attorney . You needed your sister .
BLOMKVIST: She offered .
ANNIKA: He declined .
BLOMKVIST: As she hoped .
ANNIKA: Never a good idea mixing family and usiness .
BLOMKVIST: And I still would have lost .
GREGOR: Did you have anything on him .
BLOMKVIST: I had a lot . It just was n't any good .
ERIKA: It was n't even about Mikael . It was Wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole - and the FSA Do n't ask questions . Blomkvist 's daughter seems concerned for him .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm fine , Nilla . You do n't have to worry about me .
PERNILLA: Mom 's worried .
BLOMKVIST: About me ?
PERNILLA: About all that money .
DOCTOR: You 're Mr. Palmgren 's daughter ?
SALANDER: His ward . He does n't have a daughter .
BLOMKVIST: Nilla ? What are you doing ?
PERNILLA: Nothing .
BLOMKVIST: You 're not serious .
PERNILLA: I do n't want to talk about it since I know you wo n't approve .
BLOMKVIST: Of - Nilla .
PERNILLA: Light of Life .
BLOMKVIST: Light of - what ? What is that ?
PERNILLA: You think it 's all senseless but it is n't . It 's more natural to believe in something than not to .
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me .
FRODE: First time in Hedestad ?
BLOMKVIST: And last , I 'm sure .
FRODE: It 's lovely in the spring .
BLOMKVIST: You said it was lovely in winter .
FRODE: This is unseasonable .
BLOMKVIST: I 'll be on the 4 30 train back to Stockholm .
FRODE: Unless we get snowed in I 'm joking . You 'll be home tonight , if that 's what you wish .
VANGER: Welcome . Come inside . It 's warm .
FRODE: Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4 30 train back to Stockholm .
VANGER: What ?
BLOMKVIST: I ca n't stay for dinner .
VANGER: Oh . I guess I 'd better be quick then . Thank you , Dirch . Mikael , this way .
BLOMKVIST: That you used to run one of the iggest industrial firms in the country .
VANGER: Used to . That 's correct .
BLOMKVIST: Doing .
VANGER: Officially , assisting me with my memoirs . But what you 'd really be doing is solving a mystery . And you 'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding . You 'd be investigating thieves , misers , ullies , and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you 'll ever meet my family .
BLOMKVIST: They 're still called that .
VANGER: Are they ? Okay . INSERT Close on a photo of Gottfried .
BLOMKVIST: Someone has to do it .
VANGER: That 's right . Anyway , he died in 1965 . Drowned . Drunk . Here on the island .
BLOMKVIST: And beautiful . Vanger nods as he regards the photo
VANGER: Someone in the family murdered Harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane .
BLOMKVIST: She could n't have run away ?
VANGER: Not without being seen .
BLOMKVIST: She could n't have fallen and drowned ?
VANGER: The currents are n't strong here . Anything that falls into the wate turns up nearby . Like her father . His body did n't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the yea efore .
BLOMKVIST: Who knows about these ?
VANGER: Me , the police , the murderer and now you .
BLOMKVIST: I understand your frustration . But what you 're asking me to do is a waste of money .
VANGER: We have n't discussed your fee .
BLOMKVIST: We do n't need to . I ca n't find something you have n't been able to in forty years .
VANGER: You do n't know that . You have a very keen investigative mind .
BLOMKVIST: You want me to set aside my life and career for something that 's a complete waste of time .
VANGER: Think of it as a well deserved vacation . A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now . As for compensation , I 'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes . I 'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery .
BLOMKVIST: Mr. -
VANGER: I 'm not done . I 'll throw in one more thing - even though you 're a terrible negotiator . It 's what you want more than anything else and it ca n't be bought at any price . I 'll give it to you Hans-Erik Wennerstrom .
PLAGUE: Would you like to sit ? I could possibly clear a place if necessary .
SALANDER: Did you make it ?
PLAGUE: Have you something for me ?
SALANDER: I had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit . It 's all I have right now .
PLAGUE: I find that so poignant .
ERIKA: We 're in our worst crisis ever and you 're writing a memoir ?
BLOMKVIST: You fired me ; I need something to do .
ERIKA: You fired you ; I need you here , not the North Pole . You know what this is going to look like .
BLOMKVIST: Like I 've been gutted . Like I 'm unning away . I am .
ERIKA: There is a problem between us . He wo n't be satisfied until he shuts us down , and you 're leaving me to fight him alone .
BLOMKVIST: It 's four hours by train . It 's not the North Pole .
HUSSEIN: This is the North Pole .
BLOMKVIST: What . Milk ?
NILSSON: I 'm Gunner . The caretaker .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm writing a biography of Mr. Vanger , yes .
NILSSON: I saw you on television .
BLOMKVIST: That 's unfortunate .
NILSSON: Bit of trouble , I guess .
VANGER: The island is owned by my family . Your closest neighbor is my brothe Harald , another Nazi if you can elieve . Two in the family . He 's detestable to put it nicely , but you 'll probably never see him . He 's a recluse .
BLOMKVIST: He was there that day ?
VANGER: Indeed he was .
BLOMKVIST: Does anyone speak to anyone on this island ?
VANGER: Actually , Isabella - Harriet 's mothe - who lives there - - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I do n't speak to her . Cecilia 's brother Birger lives there .
BLOMKVIST: Who does n't he speak to ?
VANGER: You , probably . Not that you 'd want him to . He can be as unpleasant as Harald .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm quickly losing track who 's who .
VANGER: Oh , how you 'll wish were it always so . Soon you 'll know us all only too well - with my apologies . Out there is my nephew Martin 's house ; Harriet 's brother .
BLOMKVIST: Who speaks to him ?
VANGER: I speak to him . He runs the company now , as I think I told you .
BLOMKVIST: I just met him .
VANGER: He was 19 when Harriet disappeared .
BLOMKVIST: And you live here .
VANGER: Sorry ?
BLOMKVIST: Your house .
VANGER: Yes , you 're right . The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list .
SALANDER: I got a call from social welfare . I 've been assigned a new guardian .
MORELL: I 'd like to see the girl 's room .
VANGER: It 's down the hall .
MORELL: I thought this was your house .
VANGER: It is . She lives with me .
MORELL: Are her parents alive ?
VANGER: Her mother is .
DET. MORELL: I want to speak to everyone here . That 'll take all night so you might want someone to put some coffee on .
YOUNGER VANGER: What about the search ?
MORELL: First thing in the morning .
YOUNGER VANGER: No . We should do it now . She could e hurt out there .
VANGER: Please . I beg you .
MORELL: But I also could n't find a motive . Was it spontaneous ? Was it planned ? Did she know something someone wished she did n't ? Was it about business ?
BLOMKVIST: Business ? She was sixteen .
MORELL: And very bright . Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the usiness someday , which would mean someone else would n't .
BLOMKVIST: She was with some friends that day . At a parade . You must have talked to them .
MORELL: She told them she was n't feeling well . She left early . But they also said she kept secrets from them , too . The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated .
BLOMKVIST: I have one .
MORELL: So you know . Did you bring the last gift Henrik eceived ?
BLOMKVIST: It 's at the National Forensic Lab .
MORELL: I can tell you what their report will say now It 's a flower common to Europe . All of them are . No prints . No DNA .
BLOMKVIST: I wanted to ask you about this .
MORELL: She received this from Henrik the Christmas before . I studied it more times than I can say . I know every page of it .
BLOMKVIST: It 's the last page I 'm curious about .
MORELL: As was I .
BLOMKVIST: The only names not alphabetized .
MORELL: They 're local Hedestad phone numbers . The first belonged to a woman named Margot , whose mother was Magda , who claimed she did n't know Harriet . The fourth , R.L. , belonged to Rosemarie Larsson , an elderly woman who died a few years before . The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find .
BLOMKVIST: I 've reminded you of things you 'd ather forget . I 'm sorry .
MORELL: I ca n't forget it . It 's my Rebecka Case . Blomkvist is n't sure what that means .
BLOMKVIST: Was this also a missing girl case ?
MORELL: No , that 's not why I mention it . The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born . I 'm talking about the soul of a policeman . Poor Torstensson could never solve it , and could never let it go .
BJURMAN: How 's Mr. Palmgren doing ? I was told he had a stroke of some kind . Terrible .
SALANDER: Make coffee and sort mail .
BJURMAN: But not full-time . Not even part- time consistently . They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August ? Nothing from her .
SALANDER: Enough .
BJURMAN: How much is your rent ?
SALANDER: I pay my rent .
BJURMAN: When 's the last time you were late ?
SALANDER: Never .
BJURMAN: Do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive ?
SALANDER: It is n't a discrepancy or a problem . It was clear to him I could manage my own finances .
BJURMAN: But that 's not clear to me .
SALANDER: I 'm not a child .
BJURMAN: No . You 're not . But you were . And between then and now - - two years in the locked ward at St. Stephens , for violent aggression - failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools - arrested twice for intoxication , twice for narcotics use , and most recently for assault a bottle smashed into a man 's face . You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking you 've improved , but looking at this - - not to mention how you 're looking at me now - I can see you have n't . So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over . Starting now , you 'll be given a monthly allowance . You 'll provide me with receipts for your expenses .
SALANDER: I 've been on my own since I was twelve .
BJURMAN: No . You 've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve .
LIV: Mikael ? We 're going to the same place . Hop in .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm afraid I 'm a bit out of shape .
MARTIN: No , it 's a climb for anyone . I should 've warned you . Come on in .
LIV: I used to work in the company 's petrochemical division in Goteborg . When it was sold , I went with it .
MARTIN: A dark day .
LIV: I live in Hong Kong now , but come ack to Stockholm for family events , and when I do , I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin .
MARTIN: She comes for the moose steak .
BLOMKVIST: Is that what this is ?
MARTIN: Something 's open . You like this one , or would you like to try something else ?
BLOMKVIST: That one 's good .
LIV: I saw you on Sky News a while ago .
BLOMKVIST: That was a dark day .
LIV: Sorry to remind you of it .
BLOMKVIST: It 's okay . There are worse things than libel - though I ca n't immediately think of one in my usiness .
LIV: You 're writing a book now , Martin said .
BLOMKVIST: Henrik 's biography .
LIV: I love Henrik . He 's fascinating . Martin , too . Together they 're the Old Sweden and the New .
BLOMKVIST: They are .
LIV: You know about Harriet , right ?
BLOMKVIST: I do .
MARTIN: What ca n't .
LIV: Harriet .
BLOMKVIST: Maybe we could talk about that later .
MARTIN: We can talk about it now . Liv knows everything about my crazy family . Which is why she 'll neve marry me .
LIV: That 's one reason .
MARTIN: Do n't put that in your book . Anything else is fine . Harriet certainly . Everything changed afte that . Not just the family , but the company .
BLOMKVIST: How so .
MARTIN: We 're not Nordea or Ericsson , but we 're still the largest family-owned company in the country . At the height , we had 40,000 employees . We have about half that now , and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - egan after my sister 's death . It oke Henrik 's entrepreneurial spirit , and his heart .
BLOMKVIST: You were here that day ?
MARTIN: Everyone was here , though I did n't get in until after the accident on the bridge . The 4 30 train .
BLOMKVIST: I know it well .
MARTIN: It was a terrible day . And the days after - searching and not finding he - were even worse . Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend 's .
CECILIA: Hi . I thought I 'd come over and say hello . I 'm Cecilia .
BLOMKVIST: It 's not about the family . It 's about Henrik and the company .
CECILIA: Like I said .
BLOMKVIST: It 's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone .
CECILIA: Unlike the one that landed you in court .
BLOMKVIST: Unlike that one . Correct .
CECILIA: So , what you 're saying is , you 're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet . Silence . Then -
BLOMKVIST: I ca n't ignore such a dramatic event , ut no , that 's not by any means my focus .
CECILIA: So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where ? - in the closet now ? - were n't Henrik 's private investigation . I wonder sometimes who 's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle .
BLOMKVIST: Since we 're talking about it , since you brought it up , what was Harriet like ?
CECILIA: I 'm sure Henrik has told you .
BLOMKVIST: He was my age then , and so could n't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter . You were her age .
CECILIA: Actually , my sister Anita was close to her in age .
BLOMKVIST: I 'd love to , where is she .
CECILIA: If I had to guess - London .
BLOMKVIST: You do n't know where your own siste lives ?
CECILIA: I have n't seen her in years . We never really got along .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm getting used to that comment .
CECILIA: That 's the way it is when you 're always after the same boys .
BLOMKVIST: People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point .
CECILIA: Oh , I 'm long over it , and wo n't ever have to worry about it again . She hates this place even more than I do . She left , moved to London and that was it . You could n't pay her to send a Christmas card , much less visit .
BLOMKVIST: I 'll try to track her down for you .
CECILIA: Do n't bother .
BLOMKVIST: For myself then .
CECILIA: If you do , and try talking to he about us , do n't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off .
TECH: You backed up ?
SALANDER: Hard drives at home , yeah .
TECH: That 's good . This one 's dead .
SALANDER: It 'll take five minutes . It 's important .
BJURMAN: Have you ever had an STD ? When 's the last time you were tested for HIV ?
BJURMAN: I 'm required to ask you these things . It 's a matter of health .
SALANDER: Write down anything you want .
BJURMAN: Why do you need such an expensive computer ?
SALANDER: For work .
BJURMAN: Making coffee and sorting mail .
SALANDER: I should n't even have to ask . I should have control of my money like efore .
BJURMAN: And you will . Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people . Can you do that ? Shall we start with me ? Shall we start now ?
BJURMAN: You feel that ? That 's gaberdine . Unzip them . And And I like the reticence . I prefer a whore who pretends she is n't . It 's almost convincing .
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me . I 'm sure I should have made an appointment .
ANITA: It 's fine . Please . Have a seat .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm Mikael .
ANITA: Mikael . How do you do .
BLOMKVIST: I would if had any money to invest .
ANITA: Excuse me ?
BLOMKVIST: I 'm writing a biography of you uncle Henrik . That 's why I 'm here .
ANITA: How is Henrik ?
BLOMKVIST: Good . Engaging . I like him . She does , too .
ANITA: I have n't seen him in over 30 years . Or my sister . Or anyone else in my family .
BLOMKVIST: Most of what I 'm writing about predates that , so your recollections are valid .
ANITA: I would n't know where to start , if that was a question .
BLOMKVIST: I can narrow it . I 've gotten up to the 1960s . To the event that altered everything in Henrik 's life .
ANITA: Harriet . Everything I knew about that I told to - whatever his name was - that policeman - when it happened .
BLOMKVIST: Morell .
ANITA: My recollections then were a lot etter than they are now .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm not speaking of the crime itself . I 'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like . Particularly , toward the end .
ANITA: She was messed up . Like all us Vanger kids . Crazy mother . Drunken father . At least hers was n't a Nazi like mine .
BLOMKVIST: Was he abusive ?
ANITA: Mine ?
BLOMKVIST: Hers .
ANITA: I never saw it myself , but you could tell something was going on . One day she 'd be withdrawn . The next she 'd e putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school . The next she 'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was eve eligious - can you imagine ? Obviously , she was very unhappy .
BLOMKVIST: She never confided in you what about , specifically ?
ANITA: There was no specifically . It was everything . It was being part of that family . Henrik 's the only decent person in it .
BLOMKVIST: What do you think happened to her ?
ANITA: Everyone knows what .
BLOMKVIST: But you have no thoughts about why , or who .
ANITA: All I know is I always felt sorry for her . Even more than for myself . I got out of there when I was 18 and never went back . She would have done the same but did n't make it to 18 .
SALANDER: Mr. Bjurman , please . It 's Lisbeth Salander . I 'm fine . I 'm sorry I missed our appointment . I had a lot of work no , nothing to be concerned about I need another advance on my allowance . Can I come to your office tonight ? I do n't need a pen , what 's the address ?
BJURMAN: Come on in .
SALANDER: It 's nice .
BJURMAN: It 's home . So , what do you need money for this time ? Grand Theft Auto 5 ?
SALANDER: Food .
BJURMAN: How are you ? Been thinking about last time ? Decided you wanted to see me again ?
SALANDER: I just want my money .
BJURMAN: Well , let 's see if I can help you out with that .
SALANDER: Wait .
BJURMAN: Is there a problem ?
SALANDER: I just want to know , am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat ?
BJURMAN: It 's so cute when you do that surly thing . Take my hand
SALANDER: I can get home on my own .
BJURMAN: Are you sure ?
ERIKA: Is it any warmer inside ?
BLOMKVIST: No .
ERIKA: The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers .
BLOMKVIST: Seriously ?
ERIKA: Is that hard to believe ? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat ?
BLOMKVIST: I 'm not . I 'm working .
ERIKA: I can see .
BLOMKVIST: Would you like to meet him ?
ERIKA: Maybe in about an hour . If you 're interested . He is .
VANGER: I apologize if you 're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael 's absence .
ERIKA: We 'll work through them .
VANGER: Are you sure ?
MARTIN: How long do you think you can hang on ? Six months or so ?
ERIKA: That sounds about right .
VANGER: You know , I used to be in the newspaper business . We owned six dailies back in the 50 's .
MARTIN: We still own one . The Courier , here in town .
VANGER: I let my nephew Birger run it since he ca n't run anything else . Erika nods politely .
MARTIN: So what do you say to taking on a partner ?
ERIKA: We 've never considered it before . We value our independence .
MARTIN: Your independence is dependant on advertisers - if we 're being honest . However much you think that is , you 'd etain . We do n't care about content .
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me . Did I miss something ?
VANGER: We 're talking about an investment in the magazine .
BLOMKVIST: I gather . Why would you want to do that ?
MARTIN: Not for the return , that 's for sure .
VANGER: I feel bad that I 've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time . This is the right thing to do . The moral thing . That 's one reason .
ERIKA: And .
VANGER: The enemies of my friends are my enemies . I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he 's done to you . Silence .
ERIKA: Have you seen him try to make a fire ?
VANGER: Put the logs on end , like this .
BLOMKVIST: How long have you been discussing this with them ?
ERIKA: I have n't been . They asked me to come up yesterday .
BLOMKVIST: Why did n't you tell me ?
ERIKA: Why would I . You live in the woods .
BLOMKVIST: So I deserve to be treated like an idiot ?
ERIKA: I wanted to hear what they had to say . You would 've said no before they could .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm saying it now . It 's not a good idea .
ERIKA: You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months . I was lying . Without their money we 'll be out of usiness in three .
BLOMKVIST: You do n't know this family . They 're crazy .
ERIKA: We 're not marrying into it .
BLOMKVIST: We are if we do this . It 's exactly what we 're doing .
ERIKA: You want to say no ? Let 's say no . Instead of 50 percent of something , let 's own 100 percent of nothing .
BLOMKVIST: What .
ERIKA: So are you coming to bed or not .
TATTOO ARTIST: You thinking one arm or both ?
SALANDER: Wrists and ankles . But none of these . Just a plain band , like handcuffs .
TATTOO ARTIST: It 's sensitive there . Particularly the ankles . It 's gon na hurt .
SALANDER: How much do one of those cost ?
ANNOUNCER: Petrochemical manufacturer Vange Industries has acquired a controlling interest in Millennium magazine which according to analysts has been in financial trouble since last Decembe when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty of libel against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom -
ERIKA: We made a serious mistake last year , and we regret it . But we 're moving forward , and this is the first step .
REPORTER 2: You would n't say the first step was your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist ?
ERIKA: That 's inaccurate . Read the original press release , Viggo . I did n't fire him . He 's on sabbatical .
REPORTER 2: Where .
ERIKA: I 'm not sure , to be honest with you .
MARTIN: Millennium is an excellent magazine . We also think it 's undervalued right now , which is good business for us .
REPORTER 3: Is any magazine really undervalued today . How many will be around tomorrow ?
VANGER: There 's another reason . I do n't like ullies .
REPORTER 3: Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom ?
VANGER: I 'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission . If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try it again , he 'll find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight ack .
REPORTER 3: You 're enjoying this .
VANGER: Already it 's the most fun I 've had in years .
BLOMKVIST: I want to look at what the pape has in its archive on the parade .
PHOTO EDITOR: The current archive is on CD 's , naturally . The older stuff , still negatives . What general period are you interested in ?
BLOMKVIST: September , 1966 .
PHOTO EDITOR: Is this about Harriet Vanger ?
BLOMKVIST: You 're too young to know about that .
PHOTO EDITOR: Everyone here grows up knowing about her . It 's how we 're taught about strangers .
BJURMAN: My dear Lisbeth , how are you ?
SALANDER: I need more money . I need to pay my ent .
BJURMAN: Come on in .
SALANDER: Me , too .
BJURMAN: You , too ? What did you buy ?
SALANDER: Good . You 're alive .
SALANDER: I 'm taking these with me . I 'll e checking on you . If I eve find anyone in here with you , whether she came of her own free will or not -
PERNILLA: Hi .
BLOMKVIST: Hi . What are you doing here ?
PERNILLA: On my way to Skelleftea . I can only stay a couple hours . He arrives and gives her a hug .
BLOMKVIST: What 's in Skelleftea ?
PERNILLA: Light of Life Bible Camp . Blomkvist tries to hide his dismay .
BLOMKVIST: It 's fine , Nilla . Whatever you want to do is fine . Everybody needs something .
PERNILLA: Just so long as it 's not God .
BLOMKVIST: I did n't say that .
PERNILLA: That 's what I 'm doing .
BLOMKVIST: It should have been me visiting you . I 'm sorry .
PERNILLA: It 's okay . Everything 's good .
BLOMKVIST: Bye . The train begins to move .
PERNILLA: Do n't go too hard on the Catholics .
BLOMKVIST: What ?
PERNILLA: The article you 're writing .
BLOMKVIST: What are you talking -
PERNILLA: The Bible quotes on your desk .
BLOMKVIST: What ?
MARTIN: We were talking . He started ubbing at his arm . Then collapsed .
BLOMKVIST: Is he -
MARTIN: I ca n't talk , Mikael , I have to -
BLOMKVIST: Go .
FRODE: The good news is he survived . How he does now , we have to see . He 's in ICU . Can I have one of those ?
BLOMKVIST: A sandwich ?
FRODE: A Scotch .
BLOMKVIST: I do n't want to be indelicate . But Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this .
FRODE: Wennerstrom .
BLOMKVIST: I need to know what he has on him . Now . In case .
FRODE: In case he dies ? That is indelicate .
BLOMKVIST: And I apologize .
FRODE: I do n't know what he has on him , if you 're asking me . And he ca n't tell you in the condition he 's in . So is that it then ? Silence . Blomkvist drinks . Eventually -
BLOMKVIST: We also never discussed who I 'd eport to if something happened to him .
FRODE: You 'd report to me , but does it matter ? We both know nothing 's going to come of this .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm not so sure .
FRODE: What do you mean ?
BLOMKVIST: I may have found something .
FRODE: You 're joking . What did you find ?
BLOMKVIST: The last time I reported something efore I was sure of it , it cost me my savings .
FRODE: Yes . Do you have one ?
BLOMKVIST: I can find one .
FRODE: I know a good one . She did the ackground check on you .
BLOMKVIST: The .
FRODE: Do you think we 'd hire anyone fo something like this without doing one ?
BLOMKVIST: I want to read it .
FRODE: That I could n't authorize .
BLOMKVIST: Mr. Frode was kind enough to share your report with me . The investigator 's name is on it , ut I can find no record of her , and I 'm pretty good at that sort of thing .
ARMANSKY: Would it really matter what her name is ?
BLOMKVIST: It would if I wanted to speak to her , which I do .
ARMANSKY: Against policy .
BLOMKVIST: You sure ?
ARMANSKY: Just like your sources . You understand .
BLOMKVIST: Let me give you a name then .
ARMANSKY: The reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed . She 's a ward of the State .
BLOMKVIST: What does that have to do with anything .
ARMANSKY: She 's had a rough life . Can we not make it rougher on her ?
SALANDER: Who is it ?
BLOMKVIST: May I come in ?
SALANDER: Actually I 'm not really up -
BLOMKVIST: That 's okay .
SALANDER: Hey . Hey - Who do you think you are ?
BLOMKVIST: I 'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do .
SALANDER: If you touch me , I 'll more than alarm you .
BLOMKVIST: That wo n't be necessary .
SALANDER: It was n't meant to be .
BLOMKVIST: When I write about people , I try to entertain the reader .
SALANDER: Wennerstrom was n't entertained . Blomkvist lets it go .
BLOMKVIST: Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you . I guess I should be flattered . He also says you 're the one he goes to for jobs that are , ` sensitive ' is the word he used . I 'll use ` illegal , ' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer . I 'm not going to do anything about that . I could but I wo n't . What I 'm going to do is tell you a story . If it entertains you , maybe you 'll decide to help me research it further . If it does n't , I 'll wash the dishes and leave Are you going to even touch your food ?
SALANDER: What kind of research ?
BLOMKVIST: Lisbeth - may I call you Lisbeth ? I want you to help me catch a killer of women .
BLOMKVIST: We need to somehow figure out who they are , what happened to them , what the Leviticus verses have to do with -
SALANDER: Getting started . You can keep talking if you want .
BLOMKVIST: Would you like this ?
SALANDER: Got it .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm home .
DET. ISAKSSON: No one 's asked me about Magda in ove 40 years . No one here even remembers her .
SALANDER: It interests me .
DET. ISAKSSON: Does it .
SALANDER: A friend of mine calls me that .
DET. ISAKSSON: So you tattoo it on your neck ?
SALANDER: My trainer .
DET. ISAKSSON: Aerobics ?
SALANDER: Boxing .
DET. ISAKSSON: I have a feeling you 're pretty good at that , even though you weigh - what - ninety pounds ? Float like a butterfly
SALANDER: What ?
DET. ISAKSSON: Come with me , Muhammad .
SALANDER: How exactly was she killed ?
DET. ISAKSSON: Miss - I 'm sorry -
SALANDER: Salander .
DET. ISAKSSON: Miss Salander , if you do n't mind my asking , when 's the last time you ate ?
SALANDER: I have a high metabolism . I ca n't put on weight .
DET. ISAKSSON: That 's not why I ask . I ask because it 's better to look at what I 'm about to show you on an empty stomach .
BLOMKVIST: How is he ? Frode takes Blomkvist aside .
FRODE: He needs surgery and there 's no DNR . So it 's up to the family to decide to esuscitate or not , and they 're not good at decisions .
BLOMKVIST: She said yes . Isabella gets up to come over -
BLOMVIST: Can I see Henrik ?
FRODE: He was asleep when I last looked in . We can check .
ISABELLA: No , you ca n't check . You can instruct him to pack his things and leave .
MARTIN: Mother -
ISABELLA: Do n't use that tone with me . This family 's had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again .
FRODE: Actually , Isabella , Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik .
ISABELLA: And who do you work for , Dirch ? Remind me who pays your salary ?
BIRGER: We should put this to a vote .
MARTIN: Do n't be an idiot , Birger .
BIRGER: It 's a family decision like any other . Cecilia ?
CECILIA: What .
BIRGER: Am I right ?
CECILIA: You are so seldom right about anything , it 's hard for me to say yes . But -
MARTIN: No . We should do what Henrik wants , and we know what he wants .
ISABELLA: Henrik - is in there fighting fo his life . This - - is the last thing he needs .
DET. ISAKSSON: Forget what she looks like , I vouch for her -
UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE: All right . Thanks . He hangs up . To Salander -
UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE: This way , Miss . He escorts her to the file room .
SALANDER: Can I make copies ?
UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE: I can make them for you if ou machine 's been repaired .
SALANDER: That 's okay .
MARTIN: My family is impossible . It 's why the company is such a mess .
BLOMKVIST: It 's all right .
MARTIN: It 's not all right , she 's unbearable . But it has nothing to do with you . It 's between her and Henrik She lost it when my father died . The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her , leaving he alone in our old house on the othe side of the island like she was excommunicated . She 's never forgiven him .
BLOMKVIST: I 'll -
MARTIN: How do you do .
SALANDER: Fine .
MARTIN: Girlfriend ?
BLOMKVIST: Assistant .
SALANDER: Everyone in town knows who and where you are .
BLOMKVIST: That 's comforting . Are you hungry ? Want a sandwich ?
SALANDER: No .
BLOMKVIST: I used to have a motorcycle . When I was 19 .
SALANDER: I know .
BLOMKVIST: `` If a man lies with a woman having her sickness , he has made naked he fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood . '' Blomkvist does n't see a connection .
SALANDER: She was raped and stabbed , but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin . R.L . Rakel Lunde ,
BLOMKVIST: `` A woman who is a medium or sorcere shall be put to death by stoning . ''
SALANDER: Sara Witt , 1964 . Daughter of a pastor . Tied to her bed , raped , charred in the fire that burned down her house . Leviticus -
BLOMKVIST: 21 9 . `` The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot , profanes her father and shall be burned with -
SALANDER: Magda Lovisa Sjoberg , 1960 - Several photos of a dead woman and dead cow -
BLOMKVIST: Leviticus 20 16 - `` If a woman lies with any beast , you shall kill the woman and the beast , their blood is upon -
SALANDER: Lea Persson , 1962 -
BLOMKVIST: Okay -
SALANDER: I 'm not done -
BLOMKVIST: It 's all right , we 're looking for a serial murderer But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island ?
SALANDER: She was looking for him , too .
BLOMKVIST: Rape . Torture . Fire . Animals . Religion . Anything I 'm missing ?
SALANDER: The names . They 're all Biblical . The first woman , the whore , the Virgin Mary - Sara , Rakel - all from the Old Testament .
BLOMKVIST: Which means they 're Jewish names . He glances off to Harald 's dark house .
SALANDER: It interests me . He takes a blanket from the back of a chair .
BLOMKVIST: I 'll take the couch . You can have the bed .
SALANDER: I can sleep on a couch .
BLOMKVIST: So can I .
SALANDER: Night .
BLOMKVIST: Is n't what .
SALANDER: Jewish .
BLOMKVIST: They 're encrypted . She gives him a don't-be-a-child look .
SALANDER: Have some coffee .
BLOMKVIST: I will . And then we 'll have a talk about what 's yours and what 's mine .
SALANDER: It 's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos .
BLOMKVIST: Thank you .
SALANDER: Too bad you do n't have hers .
BLOMKVIST: Whose .
SALANDER: Her .
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me .
SALANDER: A , C , Three - the rest is blocked .
BLOMKVIST: Norsjo .
SALANDER: Then something , K , something , R , I , F , something , I -
BLOMKVIST: Carpentry . Is that a phone number ?
SALANDER: Too small to read .
BLOMKVIST: I would n't think Harald would sign his name like this , would you ?
FRODE: I ca n't say I know how he thinks . He might .
BLOMKVIST: Has anyone spoken to him about me since I 've been here ?
FRODE: Maybe Isabella . No one else .
BLOMKVIST: Could she do something like this ?
ISABELLA: Who 's this creature now ?
FRODE: I 'm calling this off .
BLOMKVIST: No . You 're authorizing me to rent a car .
SALANDER: They do n't bother me .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm sure they 're not used to people who look like you .
SALANDER: They do n't like you either .
TECH CLERK: I ca n't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky .
SALANDER: So call him .
TECH CLERK: Next time , I 'd prefer you fill out the proper paperwork .
CLERK 1: Can I help you ?
BLOMKVIST: I 'm waiting for the older gentleman , thanks .
CLERK 2: I do n't recognize him . Sorry .
BLOMKVIST: I had to start somewhere . Thanks . As he gathers up the photos to leave -
CLERK 2: I 'm no detective , but I think I would 've started at the retirement home . Blomkvist looks up . Not a bad idea .
FORSMAN: This is Brannlund 's kid . He was a contractor , the father .
BLOMKVIST: Brannlund .
FORSMAN: Assar .
BLOMKVIST: You would n't happen to know where I could find him , the son ?
FORSMAN: Next to his father at the cemetery . He was killed in an accident on a jo site years ago . But she might be alive - His widow .
BLOMKVIST: In 1966 , you were in Hedestad with your husband . He shows her one of the photos .
MILDRED: Oh , my goodness , there we are . Who took this ?
BLOMKVIST: Photographer at the local paper .
MILDRED: It would n't be a miracle . We were on our honeymoon . But why ?
BLOMKVIST: This girl was killed that day , soon after seeing something across the street that frightened her .
MILDRED: How awful .
BLOMKVIST: Would you mind if I made a copy of this ?
BJURMAN: Ground , please .
SALANDER: How 's your sex life ?
BJURMAN: I under -
SALANDER: Do n't speak . I do n't want to hea your voice . Just nod . He nods .
BLOMKVIST: It 's that bad ?
SALANDER: Yes .
BLOMKVIST: What is that - Is that necessary ?
SALANDER: Yes .
BLOMKVIST: We ca n't just tape it ?
SALANDER: No .
BLOMKVIST: Did you sterilize that ?
SALANDER: No .
BLOMKVIST: You did n't ?
SALANDER: Drink some more .
BLOMKVIST: Careful , it 's my eye .
SALANDER: Do n't move .
BLOMKVIST: What am I doing here why did I ever come up here
SALANDER: No one 's shooting at you now .
BLOMKVIST: I 'm pretty sure this is n't a good idea .
SALANDER: Why .
BLOMKVIST: Apart from the fact that I 'm old , we work together .
SALANDER: You work with what's-her-name . That 's worked out for you . He nods . That 's true . Then -
BLOMKVIST: I have some standards of behavior , elieve it or not .
SALANDER: You need to stop talking . She climbs on top of him .
BLOMKVIST: I like working with you , too .
FRODE: People hunt on the island , Mikael . Gunner 's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner . It could have been a stray shot .
MARTIN: Not from Gunner . If he wanted to shoot him , he 'd have shot him .
FRODE: We get poachers . They 're not always such great shots .
MARTIN: Or he 's right , Dirch . What if he is ? This has to stop . Frode regards Blomkvist .
FRODE: Do you want to stop ?
BLOMKVIST: I have police reports , photos , Henrik 's notes , my own notes , and Lisbeth 's research . What I do n't have are Vanger Industries records . That 's what I want .
FRODE: Why ? Blomkvist does n't say . Only -
BLOMKVIST: Will you authorize it ?
FRODE: I could but why on earth would I ?
BLOMKVIST: Because I 'm asking .
FRODE: The private corporate records . How far back ?
BLOMKVIST: All the way . Frode exchanges a look with Martin .
FRODE: That 's not what he meant .
BLOMKVIST: Let 's ask him .
FRODE: He 's not well enough to ask .
BLOMKVIST: I 'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement , if that helps you .
FRODE: Excuse us a moment .
MARTIN: I think Henrik would say yes .
FRODE: That 's why he has me . To protect him from himself . This is insane .
MARTIN: What do we have to hide ?
FRODE: Over the course of 120 years of doing business ? Plenty .
MARTIN: If he needs this to do his job , he should have permission .
SALANDER: What am I looking for ?
BLOMKVIST: Any connections between the company 's holdings and the towns where the women were killed and everything about Frode .
CECILIA: So ask him .
BLOMKVIST: I was wondering if you could do that .
CECILIA: I do n't speak to him , as you know .
BLOMKVIST: You could n't make an exception in my case .
CECILIA: Are you afraid to be in the same oom with him ? I 'm not saying you should n't be .
BLOMKVIST: You wo n't help me ?
CECILIA: Sorry .
LINDGREN: Are you finished ?
SALANDER: No . I need to know where all the factories , offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966 .
LINDGREN: You already have everything .
SALANDER: I do n't . Nothing on subsidiary corporations , partnerships , o suppliers .
LINDGREN: Then you 'll have to do without .
SALANDER: Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need , and I need this .
LINDGREN: He said you have access to this floor .
SALANDER: Call him .
HARALD: Sven Olof Lindholm .
BLOMKVIST: Handsome .
HARALD: Birger Furugard . Me . Per Engdahl . Me .
BLOMKVIST: ` o . '
HARALD: An ` o . ' Blom - kvist .
BLOMKVIST: Perhaps if you redecorated .
HARALD: Hide the past like they do . Unde a thin , shiny veneer . Like an Ikea table . I 'm the most honest of all of them .
BLOMKVIST: The family .
HARALD: Sweden .
BLOMKVIST: Pardon me ?
HARALD: The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad . Excellent lens .
BLOMKVIST: No , it 's - I ca n't tell who it is from this angle .
HARALD: That 's Gottfried 's boy .
BLOMKVIST: Martin ?
HARALD: Handsome but useless young man , Martin . Like his father .
LINDGREN: We 're closing .
SALANDER: Nowhere near finished .
LINDGREN: I 'm not staying late .
SALANDER: I am . And I need access to all the ooms , including any that are locked . Call Frode .
FRODE: Hang on a second - I 'm going to let you decide . It 's Ms. Lindgren again .
MARTIN: Yes , Ingrid , what 's the problem ?
LINDGREN: Stay all night if you want . Leave the keys with the guard .
MARTIN: Your evening stroll ?
BLOMKVIST: Hi . How are you ?
MARTIN: I stopped at the hospital on my way home . Henrik asked me to ask you something .
BLOMKVIST: What .
MARTIN: Come on in , I 'll make you a drink .
BLOMKVIST: When .
MARTIN: Now . Blomkvist 's clothes . The fresh mud stains .
BLOMKVIST: I fell in the dark .
MARTIN: You do n't have a flashlight ? I 'll give you one .
BLOMKVIST: I just was n't being careful .
MARTIN: How 's the investigation ?
BLOMKVIST: Nothing new to report .
MARTIN: Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever . Maybe she 'll turn something up .
BLOMKVIST: Maybe .
SALANDER: Hello , Martin .
BLOMKVIST: What did he say ?
MARTIN: What ?
BLOMKVIST: You said Henrik asked you to ask me something .
MARTIN: I just did .
BLOMKVIST: What ?
MARTIN: How the investigation 's going . That was his question .
BLOMKVIST: Oh .
MARTIN: You hunt ? We should go hunting together sometime .
BLOMKVIST: Sure . They drink . Listen to a silence .
MARTIN: Nothing at all ? New . To report .
BLOMKVIST: No .
MARTIN: I can see you 're anxious .
BLOMKVIST: No .
MARTIN: To get home . After your walk .
BLOMKVIST: I suppose I am .
MARTIN: To have dinner . With you girlfriend .
BLOMKVIST: My assistant . Yes .
MARTIN: We 'll have better luck with a gun .
BLOMKVIST: Sorry ?
MARTIN: When we go hunting .
BLOMKVIST: It did n't work . I 'm here .
MARTIN: Mikael , it did work . You 're here .
BLOMKVIST: I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed .
MARTIN: How 'd you do it ? What did you find ?
BLOMKVIST: I found a picture no one had seen efore .
MARTIN: Of .
BLOMKVIST: You . In your Uppsala prep school lazer .
MARTIN: What does that say ?
BLOMKVIST: That you lied about where you were that day . Or rather when .
MARTIN: Did I ? If I did , so what . People lie all the time .
BLOMKVIST: It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate .
MARTIN: Lena Lena was a long time ago . Where 's this picture now ? With all the other junk on your desk ?
BLOMKVIST: A print is . Digital copies are on a secure photo site .
MARTIN: That 's a lie How much does the girl know ?
BLOMKVIST: Stockholm . She went there this morning .
MARTIN: And that 's a lie . She 's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap . Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl . Lisbeth . I like that name . Lisbeth . When Lisbeth leaves I 'll get a call from security , so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives -
SALANDER: Mikael - ?
MARTIN: So what would you like to know ?
MARTIN: No . I 'm not a rapist . Of course I do that too - and at one time it was enough - but - A rapist , Mikael , gets off on domination . I need - destruction . Martin gets up and sets about the business of
MARTIN: Say something .
BLOMKVIST: You are a sick fuck .
MARTIN: Is this an interview or an editorial ?
BLOMKVIST: Your sister was n't just another girl .
MARTIN: What happened to her .
BLOMKVIST: You 're choking me -
MARTIN: You found her ?
BLOMKVIST: You killed her . Martin just stares at him confused . Then -
MARTIN: You useless fuckin detective .
SALANDER: May I kill him ?
BLOMKVIST: He has more guns in the den -
SALANDER: I know .
BLOMKVIST: Where is he ?
SALANDER: Dead .
FRODE: Where 's Mikael ?
SALANDER: Asleep . Coffee ? There 's no milk . Frode absently shakes his head no .
FRODE: I have some very upsetting news . Martin was killed in a car accident last night .
SALANDER: Sad .
FRODE: What ?
SALANDER: I said it 's sad .
FRODE: What do you know about this ?
SALANDER: Let him sleep . It 's not a request ; it 's a command .
FRODE: What are we going to do ?
SALANDER: We 're going home , Mikael and me . I do n't know what you 're going to do .
FRODE: I 'm going to the police .
SALANDER: Show them the videos while you 're at it .
FRODE: The - Salander points to a stack of video tapes .
SALANDER: Would you like to see them ?
FRODE: No .
BLOMKVIST: How is it someone who 's 23 is a ward of the state ?
SALANDER: I 'm mentally incompetent and ca n't manage daily life .
BLOMKVIST: Since when have they said that .
SALANDER: Since I was twelve .
BLOMKVIST: Something happened when you were twelve ? She does n't say . Just studies him
SALANDER: I tried to kill my father . I burned him alive . Got about 80 percent of him .
BLOMKVIST: Oh . Silence . Then -
SALANDER: We need milk .
BLOMKVIST: Harriet ?
SALANDER: I think so .
BLOMKVIST: Martin did n't deny killing anyone . But when I mentioned Harriet , he was confused . He was angry - at me - fo not being able to tell him what happened to her . He did n't kill her . And his fathe was dead the year before . What if she did somehow get away ? Could she have done that ? Could she have done it alone ? He goes up to his wall of suspects .
VANGER: Poor Martin .
BLOMKVIST: I have to go away for a couple days . When I come back , I hope to have an answer for you .
VANGER: Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy .
BLOMKVIST: She 's my partner , Henrik . She should stay .
VANGER: What have you found ?
BLOMKVIST: I 'm not sure .
VANGER: Do n't treat me like a child . Tell me .
BLOMKVIST: I ca n't . I do n't know . I need a week . Vanger studies him . Then -
VANGER: I 've waited forty years . I can wait another week .
BLOMKVIST: I always liked this song . You do n't ?
SALANDER: I do n't like classical music .
TRINITY: Plague ?
PLAGUE: Trinity .
SALANDER: Wasp .
BLOMKVIST: Mikael .
SALANDER: The money .
BLOMKVIST: Fuck me .
SALANDER: It 's your turn .
BLOMKVIST: It 's me . Sorry to bother you .
ANITA: What do you want ?
BLOMKVIST: No one 's called you ?
ANITA: About .
BLOMKVIST: Your cousin . She has two , but does n't ask which -
ANITA: What about him ?
BLOMKVIST: He died last Thursday . A ca accident . I 'm sorry . There 's going to be a memorial in Hedestad . I know you have n't been ack there in a long time , but -
ANITA: I 'm not interested in any memorial .
BLOMKVIST: I understand .
ANITA: What do you understand ?
BLOMKVIST: That you do n't really care for any of your relatives . Still , I thought you should know .
ANITA: Now I know . And now , she closes the door .
SALANDER: How 'd it go ?
BLOMKVIST: Okay . I think .
TRINITY: She 's on .
BLOMKVIST: She 's playing solitaire ? And she still has n't called anyone .
SALANDER: No .
BLOMKVIST: Do we have her cell , too ?
SALANDER: Put your hand back on my shoulder .
BLOMKVIST: I was just thinking . What if -
SALANDER: Ten more seconds .
BLOMKVIST: I was just thinking , there could be one other possibility .
ANITA: What is it now . He comes in and sits .
BLOMKVIST: I want to show you something .
HARRIET: Actually , it was the other way around . She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself .
BLOMKVIST: What did he think about that ?
HARRIET: Nothing . Only that he loved her . She said , If you love me , you 'll do this and not ask why . He never did .
BLOMKVIST: They both died twenty years ago .
HARRIET: A car accident . You found that , too .
BLOMKVIST: Is this you ?
HARRIET: I was 14 the first time he raped me .
BLOMKVIST: Martin .
HARRIET: No , my father . He took this picture . Martin did n't start until he died .
BLOMKVIST: Why did n't you tell someone ?
HARRIET: I did . My mother . Blomkvist stares . Finally -
BLOMKVIST: Henrik would have done something .
HARRIET: Would he ? I do n't know . I almost told him . But I was afraid because of what I did . You still do n't understand ?
BLOMKVIST: How 'd you get away ? Anita ?
ANITA: Do n't take anything .
HARRIET: How did you get away ?
BLOMKVIST: Someone saved me , too .
VANGER: I 'm fine . Thank you , Anna .
HARRIET: Hi , Henrik .
FRODE: I do n't even remembe Wennerstrom working here , much less eing fired
BLOMKVIST: Why would you . It was a long time ago . Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled .
FRODE: I do n't think I 'm seeing the point .
BLOMKVIST: Yes , you are .
FRODE: It happened in the 1970 's
BLOMKVIST: Come on , he knows you ca n't try somebody for this 35 years later . I like Henrik , but he knows that . Frode disagrees -
FRODE: A man 's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that . I 'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion .
BLOMKVIST: The `` court of public opinion , '' Dirch , makes celebrities out of girls who shop . Henrik promised me Wennerstrom 's carcass on a plate . This is n't even the plate . I ca n't do anything with this .
FRODE: Of course you 're right I 'm sorry .
SALANDER: Fuck these people
BLOMKVIST: Yeah
SALANDER: Harriet most of all .
BLOMKVIST: Excuse me ?
SALANDER: If she 'd done anything but run , Martin would n't have been able to kill all those women .
BLOMKVIST: She had no idea he was doing it .
SALANDER: She should have killed her father and him .
BLOMKVIST: That 's what you would 've done . Not everyone 's you .
SALANDER: What happened with Wennerstrom . How did he get you ?
BLOMKVIST: I was stupid . I got something from an anonymous source , who I 'm sure now worked for him . It was fake . Which he easily proved in court . Not a good day , that . Then -
SALANDER: You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral . Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom ? He regards her , uncertain what she means
BLOMKVIST: On Wennerstrom .
ERIKA: How do you know this ?
BLOMKVIST: This time you do n't want to know .
ERIKA: This time I do want to know .
BLOMKVIST: I have access to his computer , and his accountants ' and lawyers ' . She is n't happy to hear that explanation .
ERIKA: And how do you have that ?
BLOMKVIST: I could have gotten it from a source inside the company .
ERIKA: But you did n't .
BLOMKVIST: But that 's what you 'll say .
ERIKA: But what will you say to me ?
BLOMKVIST: That depends on if you really want to know .
ERIKA: I do . Who gave you access ?
ANNOUNCER: Journalist Mikael Blomkvist - who this time last year was convicted of libel in a Stockholm courtroom - does n't seem to have learned from that experience . Or maybe he has -
BLOMKVIST: He 'll call it a personal vendetta ut it wo n't work . FI ca n't ignore anking and securities fraud like this . The police ca n't ignore the organized crime stuff . They 'll both have to investigate .
SALANDER: Then .
BLOMKVIST: We 'll be back in court , but this time it 'll cost him . That 's probably it , though . These guys never to prison .
SALANDER: It 's embarrassing .
BLOMKVIST: What .
SALANDER: I need to borrow some money . Blomkvist grins and reaches for his wallet .
BLOMKVIST: I do n't know that I have that much .
SALANDER: You do . I 'm sorry that I know that . You have 65 thousand in your two accounts .
WENNERSTROM: These allegations - like the last ones from this so-called journalist - are as ridiculous as they are untrue -
REPORTER: What about his documentation ?
WENNERSTROM: Fabricated . All of it .

LUCILLA: How do you know that ?
COMMODUS: I 've been so informed . She arches an eyebrow .
LUCILLA: Maybe he just misses us .
COMMODUS: And the Senators . He would n't have summoned them if
LUCILLA: Peace , Commodus . After two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head . A beat .
COMMODUS: The first thing I shall do is hono him with games worthy of his majesty .
LUCILLA: The first thing I shall do is have a hot bath .
COMMODUS: Why have we stopped ?
SOLDIER #1: He 's at the front , sir .
COMMODUS: Is the battle won ?
SOLDIER #1: Do n't know , sir . They 've been gone for eight days .
COMMODUS: My sister wants a bath , take her to the camp . Take me to my father .
LUCILLA: Civilization at last . Gods preserve us .
TITUS: You would do as well to read the mind of a rhinoceros .
MAXIMUS: A people should know when they are conquered . A beat .
MARCUS: Maximus , you prove your valor again . Let us hope for the final time here .
MAXIMUS: I do n't think there 's anyone left to fight .
MARCUS: There are always people left to fight
MAXIMUS: Should Caesar permit , I 'll go home . I 've been away too long . I 've forgotten my wife 's face and I arely know my son .
GERMAN PRISONER: THIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING , CONQUEROR !
MARCUS: Stop You speak our language ?
GERMAN PRISONER: You have been in my homeland fo twelve years . Of course I speak your language . So did my son , who you murdered . So did my daughter , who you raped .
MAXIMUS: Come , Caesar
MARCUS: No . Let him speak I am Rome , what would you say to me ?
GERMAN PRISONER: You are that sun , Rome , and you time is over You can slit a thousand throats here , and you can put a thousand babies to the sword , ut it will always be our home .
MARCUS: Now it is Rome .
GERMAN PRISONER: It will never be Rome . Not as long as one German breathes .

MARCUS: You 've missed the war . We 're done here . Commodus embraces him , awkward .
COMMODUS: Father . Congratulations . I shall sacrifice a thousand doves to hono your triumph .
MARCUS: Spare the doves and honor Maximus , he won the battle . Commodus embraces Maximus , even more awkward .
COMMODUS: General , Rome salutes you and I embrace you as a brother .
MAXIMUS: Highness .
COMMODUS: Your Spaniards seem invincible . May the Gods favor the Felix Regiment now and always Here , Father , take my arm .
MARCUS: Where 's your sister ?
COMMODUS: She 's at the camp . She had no desire to see the gore of the attlefield .
MARCUS: Lucilla would eat every corpse here if it brought her one step closer to the throne . Maximus laughs .
MAXIMUS: Caesar , you do the lady injustice .
MARCUS: It 's a foolish old cobra who does n't ecognize his own off-spring I think I should ride now .
COMMODUS: He 's dying . A beat .
MAXIMUS: If you 'll excuse me , Highness . He turns and stalks away .
GALLUS: Aye , General , they 're going to make a bronze one for it . Long fingers this time .
MAXIMUS: And the women of your village will crave your touch even more .
GALLUS: Ah , then you know the women of my village . Maximus smiles and moves on .
MAXIMUS: What 's your name , son ?
VALERIUS: Valerius , General .
MAXIMUS: The name suits you .
VALERIUS: Why am I dying ?
MAXIMUS: You 're dying because you love Rome , as I do .
VALERIUS: I 've never been to Rome .
MAXIMUS: Neither have I. Rome for us lives here it 's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children .
VALERIUS: It must be glorious , Rome . I 've only seen pictures . Is it a glorious place ? A beat .
MAXIMUS: Yes , it 's a glorious place .
VALERIUS: It must be . He smiles . And he is dead .
FALCO: Hail , Marcus Aurelius .
MARCUS: Stand up , Senators . That unfamilia posture does n't suit you .
GAIUS: We live in supplication to you glory .
MARCUS: All the while conspiring with that fat man in Rome . How is the old monster ?
GAIUS: Senator Gracchus is hale , sire .
MARCUS: Still damning me to the four winds ?
GAIUS: Still eager for your triumphant eturn to Rome , Caesar .
MARCUS: I would have silenced him decades ago but I just like him too much .
MAXIMUS: If you want to stay on , I support you . So do the men . I 'll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place .
TITUS: It wo n't be the Felix Regiment without you .
MAXIMUS: I 'll return after a season at home . Maybe two .
TITUS: And you 'll be too fat from Vibia 's cooking to get on your horse by then .
MAXIMUS: Should the Gods so bless me . I would be thankful . Commodus perambulates up to them .
COMMODUS: Hail , warriors . My congratulations .
MAXIMUS: Yes .
COMMODUS: A pity . I 'll need men like you in my army
MAXIMUS: I 'm going home . Senators Gaius and Falco join them .
GAIUS: And why not apply for entry to the Senate ?
FALCO: A war hero with a handsome face and a strong heart could go far .
COMMODUS: General Maximus , may I present Senators Gaius and Falco . Beware of this Gaius , he 'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear and you 'll wake up one day and all you 'll say is `` Republic , Republic , Republic '' Laughter .
FALCO: Have you never considered Rome ?
MAXIMUS: No .
COMMODUS: You 've had my ear since we were children . You could be a valuable ally in the Senate .
GAIUS: Are you a believer in Republicanism ?
COMMODUS: There I warned you .
MAXIMUS: I 'm a soldier , not a politician .
GAIUS: If your heart lies with the people , I would back you for the Senate . I 'm sure Gracchus would as well .
COMMODUS: Not a word about that sodomite astard .
GAIUS: The august Senator Gracchus has been ather a gadfly on the flesh of the imperial family .
FALCO: He 's a damned provocateur .
GAIUS: He lives under the antiquated assumption that the Senate should epresent the people with vigor .
COMMODUS: I wo n't tolerate it . His incessant criticism exhausts me . The man can speak for five hours without taking a breath .
GAIUS: He serves Rome best when he serves it with honesty .
COMMODUS: Enough Maximus , I would like to inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn . Please arrange it .
MAXIMUS: I ca n't do that .
COMMODUS: Excuse me ?
MAXIMUS: My men have been fighting for five solid days . They 're too busy dying to go on dress parade .
COMMODUS: Of course , how foolish of me . Some other time
MARCUS: If only you had been born a man
LUCILLA: Father .
MARCUS: What a Caesar you would have made .
LUCILLA: You 're right .
MARCUS: I think you would have been strong . I wonder if you would have been just ?
LUCILLA: I would have been what you taught me to be .
MARCUS: Well , pretend to be my loving daughter tonight and walk with me to my chamber .
MAXIMUS: Caesar . Marcus holds out a scroll .
MARCUS: Read this .
MAXIMUS: I never acquired the art , sir .
MARCUS: Of course . No matter . In this letter I denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the Emperorship after my death . A stunned pause . Maximus stares at him .
MAXIMUS: Caesar , I am honored but
MARCUS: For twenty years I have been spilling blood . For twenty years I have written philosophy and uminated and conquered . Since I ecame Caesar I have only had fou years without war . Four years of peace in twenty . So perhaps I can e forgiven . A long beat .
MAXIMUS: Sire , you brought the light of the Gods to barbarian darkness . You ought civilization and justice to the farthest
MARCUS: I have brought the sword nothing more ! Rome is far away and we should n't be here . What matter is it to the Gods if we subdue one more tribe of Parthians or Gauls ? What matter is it to Rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash ? A beat . Marcus sits . He does n't look at Maximus . A pause .
MAXIMUS: Yes , Caesar .
MARCUS: If the dream is ever to live again the people must have a true voice . The voice I took from them . That all the Caesars took from them , bit y bit , conquest by conquest . And now that I am dying I am going to give them that voice again .
MAXIMUS: You 're not dying .
MARCUS: I am , Maximus . It 's strange I find as I near the end I think little of the waning moments around me instead I think much of the past and of the future . How will the world speak my name in years to come ? Will I be known as the philosopher ? The warrior ? The tyrant ? Or will there be a more golden sounding to my name ? Will I e the Emperor who gave Rome back her freedom ? A beat .
MAXIMUS: Caesar , you do me honor but you son has pride of place fo succession .
MARCUS: You are the son I should have had Although I fear in my deepest heart that if you had truly been my son my lood would have polluted you as it did Commodus . We 're a cursed loodline . We have lived so long in power and depravity that we no longer remember a life without it . We can no longer even imagine a life without it . A beat .
MAXIMUS: I shall , Caesar . A beat .
MARCUS: I 'll keep this letter to myself . I hope that with the sunrise you will agree . And embrace me as a father .
MAXIMUS: You have always been my father . He goes .
LUCILLA'S VOICE: He always favored you
LUCILLA: Even over his son .
MAXIMUS: That 's not true .
LUCILLA: Maximus , stop Let me see your face . He turns to her .
MAXIMUS: I lost too many men .
LUCILLA: What does my father intend ? He turns and walks . She walks with him .
MAXIMUS: I do n't know .
LUCILLA: You 're lying . I could tell when you were lying even when we were children . You hate it .
MAXIMUS: I never acquired your comfort with it .
LUCILLA: True . But then you never had to . Maximus , stop Is it really so terrible seeing me again ?
MAXIMUS: No . I 'm sorry . I 'm tired from the attle .
LUCILLA: And you are hurt to see my fathe dying . A beat .
MAXIMUS: I will always serve the ideals of Rome . A beat .
LUCILLA: Do you know I still remember you in my prayers ? Oh yes , I pray Ever since that day you saved me from drowning off Capri . Do you emember ?
MAXIMUS: Yes .
LUCILLA: Commodus was so angry that a mere peasant a Spaniard no less touched the royal person , do you emember his anger ?
MAXIMUS: Yes .
LUCILLA: Mark this , Maximus that is the man who will be Emperor . A beat .
MAXIMUS: May I be permitted to go , Highness ? She smiles sadly .
LUCILLA: There was a time when you did n't call me `` Highness . ''
MAXIMUS: And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea . All that was a different life .
LUCILLA: Very different I wonder if it was etter ?
MAXIMUS: It was more honest .
COMMODUS: I search the faces of the Gods fo ways to please you to make you proud and I can never do it . One kind word one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years What is it in me you hate so much ? My eyes are your eyes . My hands are your hands . All I have ever wanted was to live up to you . Caesar . Father .
MAXIMUS: Quintus ?
COMMODUS: Lament with me , brother , our great father is dead . I want
MAXIMUS: How did he die ? Commodus does not respond .
COMMODUS: The surgeons say it was his breath that gave out .
MAXIMUS: How will the world speak your name now , old man ? Without a glance to Commodus , he stalks out .
LUCILLA: Hail , Caesar .
MAXIMUS: What ? !
ASSASSIN #1: All right , this is far enough .
ASSASSIN #3: Come on , General
MAXIMUS: Have you ever done this before ?
ASSASSIN #3: What ?
MAXIMUS: Killed a man with a sword ?
ASSASSIN #3: Not like this , exactly this is good , you can stop .
MAXIMUS: It can be very messy you could get blood all over your armor . You do n't want to hack me up now . You want one clean stroke .
ASSASSIN #3: Would you kneel , General ?
MAXIMUS: One good stroke you do know where , do n't you ?
ASSASSIN #4: Be quiet .
MAXIMUS: If you miss the spot there 'll be lood everywhere . Quite a spray .
ASSASSINS #3: All right , where ?
MAXIMUS: Here you do n't want to hit the vein on the neck
COMMODUS: Even as the Gods curse this dark day with clouds , so too does the sun egin to shine forth on a promised tomorrow . Even as we mourn the passing of our father , so too do we celebrate the coming of a bright , new age for Rome . At my side , others , you shall pull fresh glories from the heavens . At my side , brothers , you shall know the adoration of the Gods . Doubly-dark is this day because my friend , you noble commander Maximus Meridas , has een called to Rome to deal with urgent matters of state
FELIX REGIMENT: Hail , Caesar !
TITUS: Quintus , what is ?
MAXIMUS' SON: MOTHER ! MOTHER ! FATHER 'S HOME !
MAXIMUS: Am I in Hades ?
JUBA: Yes .
SLAVE TRADER: Proximo , my old friend , see what I have for you today !
PROXIMO: Those giraffes you sold me wo n't mate ! All they do is run around not mating ! YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH
SLAVE TRADER: I will make it up to you , Master . It 's bargain day for you ! Look , look , look I have two lions and a panther hear how they roar fo you ! `` Bring me home , Proximo ! '' Proximo examines the animals .
PROXIMO: How much for the lot ?
SLAVE TRADER: For you 8,000 sesterces .
PROXIMO: For me 6,000 sesterces and I want to see their balls first . And you throw in those two slaves .
SLAVE TRADER: What about this one ? Look at the arms !
PROXIMO: Good teeth
SLAVE TRADER: 1,000 sesterces .
PROXIMO: My ass You throw in this one and we 'll make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot .
SLAVE TRADER: I have to eat , Master ! He 's my finest , I could n't let him go as part of the lot for less than 9,000 total I tell you this one is prime . He 's a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my men before he could be subdued !
PROXIMO: All right , let 's see .
SLAVE TRADER: STOP ! STOP !
PROXIMO: I 'll give you 500 sesterces .
SLAVE TRADER: No no 1,000 !
PROXIMO: Come , do n't quibble with your old friend . I 'll take the lions , the panther , the Numidian and this one for 7,000 . And I 'll buy you the est whore in the town for two nights . She 's an enormous mountain of flesh who craves a stern hand .
SLAVE TRADER: How could I say no to my old friend Proximo ?
PROXIMO: COME ON , YOU FILTHY BEAST !
JUBA: Have you killed a man before ? Maximus does not respond .
SCRIBE: I know nothing of armaments and warfare ! I 'm a scribe I write down words ! I can write down seven languages
VIBIUS: Be still .
SCRIBE: I do n't how do you hold the sword ? ! I 've never held a sword !
VIBIUS: You point the sharp end at you opponent and you shove it in his guts .
SCRIBE: I ca n't I He suddenly vomits .
VIBIUS: Proximo ! You insult me with this carrion ! Chain him to someone else !
PROXIMO: Do n't worry , noble Vibius , he wo n't e bothering you for long . The Scribe begins to weep .
CHILDREN: Dead guts ! Dead guts ! Dead guts !
PROXIMO: Some of you say you ca n't fight , you wo n't fight They all say that But one day you will pick up a sword and thrust it into another man . And the crowd will cheer you and love you . And you will love them for it . On that day you will be a gladiator . He stops at Maximus .
JUBA: Are we going to fight each other ?
PROXIMO: Make it 600 sesterces for each decapitation .
TRAINER #1: How many strokes ?
PROXIMO: Two .
TRAINER #1: For the great Vibius , one stroke .
PROXIMO: Done . 400 sesterces for two strokes . In the arena
TRAINER #1: Who 's he with ?
PROXIMO: A Greek Scribe .
TRAINER #1: I 'll raise the wager .
PROXIMO: Give me odds , friend . In the arena
GRACCHUS: We have plague in the Hebrew Quarte and it is spreading we have looting at the granaries we have so much filth in the Tiber that the water is undrinkable we have Praetorian Guard units that are demanding protection payments from the merchants at the exchange
MARCELLUS: My City Guard units have tried to curtail these excesses but no constabulary can police the entire city . And the Praetorians outnumbe us two to one .
GRACCHUS: Rome dies as the Emperor plays at eneficence . At least Nero gave us music !
GAIUS: Do you think he 'll listen to us ?
GRACCHUS: It is his duty to hear the will of the Senate .
CHILD: We honor Caesar with the laurel to show our love and appreciation fo his benevolence .
COMMODUS: Caesar is honored to accept you tribute , Citizen Scholar .
GRACCHUS: Darling children , to be sure , now if I may proceed ?
COMMODUS: Very well
GRACCHUS: Caesar , your presence in Rome is an invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have beset the city since you father went to the wars . We would like to
COMMODUS: Peace , good Gracchus , peace
GRACCHUS: With respect , sire , the people do n't need love they need law . The Senate has prepared a series of protocols to begin addressing the corruption in the city starting with basic sanitation in the Hebrew Quarter . If Caesar could study this and
COMMODUS: You see that 's the very problem , is n't it , my old , old friend ? My father spent all his time at study . At books and learning and philosophy
GRACCHUS: The Senate is the people .
COMMODUS: I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do , Senator Gracchus
GRACCHUS: Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague , sire ?
COMMODUS: No . But if you interrupt me one more time I assure you that you shall . I will emulate the immortal Caesars of the past . I will give the people what they truly want . Starting this day I will draw all of Rome to the Colosseum . I will give them bread . And they will want nothing more .
GRACCHUS: You want to hold games ?
COMMODUS: Not just any games , Senator ! A series of games that will make the Gods envious and leave my children happy ! I will subsidize the arena from this day forth and I will culminate this celebration in a great spectacle the likes of which the world has never seen ! A great spectacle to honor my father ! Magnificent , unending weeks of festivity all in the name of Marcus Aurelius ! A beat .
GRACCHUS: If I may , Caesar how are you going to pay for this ?
COMMODUS: That is not your concern . Gracchus ignores a warning look from Gaius .
GRACCHUS: Respectfully , sire , taxation and import duties are the exclusive province of the Senate
COMMODUS: MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND I WILL HONOR HIM ! AND THE PEOPLE WILL LOVE ME ! AND THE SENATE WILL OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL BURN ! BURN ! BURN ! I WILL HAVE ORDER !
LUCILLA: Gentlemen , in the future do not concern my brother with these matters . Come to me . She sweeps out . A beat .
MARCELLUS: Games ? He wants to hold games ?
GAIUS: It 's madness .
GRACCHUS: No it 's not A beat .
PROXIMO: I 've wagered on you against the Celts ignore the others and go for them there are two axe-and- net and two long spear . Now the Celts are n't used to the sun so you have the advantage there
VIBIUS: MOVE ASIDE ! THIS IS A TABLE FOR MEN !
PROXIMO: Butterfly ?
MAXIMUS: Gladiator . A beat .
PROXIMO: And nothing more ?
MAXIMUS: Nothing more . A beat .
PROXIMO: In two days we leave for Rome .
MAXIMUS: The Emperor will he be there ?
PROXIMO: Oh yes . He 's apparently quite mad about the games . Spending a fortune , which is , needless to say , good for me again . But what is good for you , Gladiator ?
MAXIMUS: Have you how does one meet the Emperor ?
PROXIMO: As a gladiator ?
MAXIMUS: Yes .
PROXIMO: One does n't .
MAXIMUS: He give it personally ?
PROXIMO: He did to me Our great father Marcus Aurelius looked into my eyes and touched me on the shoulder .
MAXIMUS: You knew Marcus ?
PROXIMO: I did n't know him . He touched me on the shoulder . Just once . But that was enough . A beat .
COMMODUS: All my desires are splitting my head to pieces there 's so much I want to do but all my efforts to show my children they are loved go unappreciated by those dragons in the Senate
LUCILLA: Quiet , brother
COMMODUS: All I want is to be a good father to my people . Why do n't they understand that ? She goes to him .
LUCILLA: Shhh . The tonic will help She takes a sip and then hands it to him .
COMMODUS: I must take a firmer hand with them . They must know their father can be firm . As our father was firm with us .
LUCILLA: Our father lost his way . His mistake was believing the old songs of the `` Republic . '' We know better . So let the Senate talk . They have no real power .
COMMODUS: Yes yes you always know the way . You were always so wise in these matters You know if I did n't have my duty to Rome I think I should be an artist . I should go away and paint pictures of the sea and leave all the politics to you
LUCILLA: Still afraid of the dark , brother ?
COMMODUS: Still . Always . A beat .
LUCILLA: I 'll stay with you until you are asleep .
COMMODUS: And after just sit with me . Keep me safe He is asleep . She watches him for a moment and then rises . She goes .
LUCILLA: He 's asleep . Be quick .
GRACCHUS: We 've taking a sounding , the Senate is with us .
LUCILLA: Good .
GRACCHUS: But we are only words . We are air . We need steel .
MARCELLUS: The City Guard is faithful to the Republic . But we do n't stand a chance against the Praetorians .
LUCILLA: Can they be bought ?
MARCELLUS: They are zealots totally committed to your brother .
GRACCHUS: Well , can they at least be rented for a day ?
MARCELLUS: I doubt it . He pays them exorbitant salaries and lets them loot and extort as they see fit . The city elongs to them .
LUCILLA: And they 've started arresting scholars now . Anyone who dares speak out even satirists and chroniclers .
MARCELLUS: And mathematicians and Christians . All to fill the arena .
GAIUS: And what pays for it ? These games are costing a fortune and yet we have no new taxes .
LUCILLA: The future . The future pays fo it A beat . She looks at them .
GAIUS: No .
MARCELLUS: That ca n't be true
LUCILLA: He 's selling Rome 's reserves of grain . The people will be starving in two years . I hope they are enjoying the spectacles because soon enough they will be dead because of them .
MARCELLUS: Rome must know this .
LUCILLA: And who will tell them ? ! You , Marcellus ? You , Senator Gaius ? Will you make a speech on the Senate floor denouncing my brother ? And then see your family in the Colosseum ? What town-crier would dare ? A long beat .
GAIUS: The Praetorians would only seize control themselves .
LUCILLA: No cut off the head and the snake can not strike .
GRACCHUS: Lucilla , Gaius is right . Until the City Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing .
MARCELLUS: And I have n't enough men .
LUCILLA: What about the army ?
GAIUS: No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years .
LUCILLA: So we do nothing ? ! A door opens , a voice
LUCIUS' VOICE: Mother
LUCIUS: I heard voices
LUCILLA: It 's all right , darling , you Lucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus
LUCIUS: Senator ! What did you bring me ? !
GRACCHUS: For you prince Lucius a sea monster !
LUCIUS: Below Macedonia !
GRACCHUS: Show me on the map .
LUCILLA: Lucius , you go in now , I 'll be in shortly .
LUCIUS: Thank you , Senator Mountain !
GRACCHUS: You 're welcome , Prince Anthill !
LUCILLA: What are you going to do ? Gracchus goes to her , holds her .
GRACCHUS: Peace child One dark night the Gods will light our path . They will give us the voice we need . Have faith in that . Have faith .
VIBIUS: Not what you expected ?
MAXIMUS: No .
VIBIUS: Rome is nothing but a slaughte house . And we are the meat .
PROXIMO: Stop that ! You 'll get some monstrous disease and then you 'll be worth nothing to me !
JUBA: Do you think it will be much different ? Here in Rome ?
MAXIMUS: Bigger arena . Same killing . A beat .
JUBA: Are you scared for tomorrow ?
MAXIMUS: No . A beat .
JUBA: Me too . A beat .
MAXIMUS: This is n't my home .
JUBA: For all Romans this is home . A beat .
MAXIMUS: Perhaps one day you 'll return . Juba looks at him .
JUBA: How can I go back ? I am not what I was . When a man kills for no eason , he has lost himself . A long beat .
CASSIUS: and the Emperor will have no more animal battles today Upset roars from some of the trainers .
TRAINER #1: You promised me a bear match , Cassius !
TRAINER #2: I have ten damned gorillas ! You said gorillas yesterday !
CASSIUS: Talk to the man in the imperial box . Who has the next slot ? Lentulus , Gideon , Trebonius and Proximo Nice to have you back , you piratical bastard now listen , the Emperor wants the Carthage spectacle .
PROXIMO: No have pity , Cassius !
TRAINER #3: My men are too good for !
CASSIUS: You give us the Carthage match o lose your spot on the rotation ut do n't worry gold is flowing from the Emperor 's fingers .
TRAINER #3: It 'll cost you
PROXIMO: I wo n't do it for less than 100,000 sesterces !
TRAINER #4: 120,000 ! All I have is my best Thracians !
CASSIUS: And I want to see this famous Spaniard of yours his reputation soars from the provinces . The people are eager for him
PROXIMO: I wo n't throw my Spaniard into a spectacle ! Damn you and damn the otation !
CASSIUS: You will and the price will be 90,000 sesterces each which you all know is exorbitant
TRAINER #4: My Thracians are worth !
CASSIUS: Give me your best , brothers . They die before Caesar .
PROXIMO: I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will kill at least one of your Thracians .
TRAINER #4: 30,000 ? ! On a Spaniard ? ! That provincial sun has curdled you ain !
PROXIMO: Then make the wager , you smug astard !
MAXIMUS: Yes , but
PROXIMO: Ignore the others go for the Thracians . The sun is to the east over the gate keep your back to the gate and you wo n't have the sun .
MAXIMUS: What ? Trumpets begin sounding from the arena .
PROXIMO: Hurry !
CASSIUS: This day we reach back to hallowed antiquity to bring you THE FALL
COMMODUS: Slave ! Who are you ?
MAXIMUS: I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS , GENERAL OF THE FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS !
COMMODUS: Why is he still alive ?
LUCILLA: I do n't know .
COMMODUS: He should n't be alive . That vexes me . I am terribly vexed
LUCILLA: Mmm .
COMMODUS: I do too . Simple , elegant
LUCILLA: What are you going to do ?
COMMODUS: I 'm going to kill him .
LUCILLA: Good .
COMMODUS: Oh , you 're too clever , Sister . Do n't tell me part of you wo n't weep for him .
LUCILLA: When he defies my brother the Emperor , he defies me . But you should n't send assassins .
COMMODUS: No ?
LUCILLA: The people embraced him today . They will be expecting his next match let him die in the arena like the slave he is . Let the people see what comes of defying Caesar . A beat as he looks at her .
COMMODUS: He wounded you deeply , did n't he ? Long ago . She does not answer .
JUBA: I will fight with you .
MAXIMUS: This is n't your battle .
JUBA: Better to die for a friend than to die for gold .
PROXIMO: Enjoy yourself , Madame General , perform well and there will e riches for you .
LUCILLA: Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions .
MAXIMUS: I knew your brother would send assassins . I did n't think he would send his best .
LUCILLA: Maximus , listen to me
MAXIMUS: My family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive .
LUCILLA: I knew nothing of that .
MAXIMUS: Do n't lie to me .
LUCILLA: I wept for them .
MAXIMUS: Do n't . A long , tense moment . She does not look at him .
LUCILLA: Do you know what it is to be the daughter of the Emperor ? I learned on the night my father had my husband killed . I loved my husband very much . Very simply . He was a man who believed in the Republic . He was a man who thought Marcus should be tending to Rome and not conquering the world . One night my father had him strangled fo conspiring with the Senate . My father never spoke of it . I neve spoke of it . That is what it is to e the daughter of Rome . She finally looks up at Maximus .
MAXIMUS: My son was innocent .
LUCILLA: So is mine . A beat .
MAXIMUS: I want your brother dead .
LUCILLA: So do I .
MAXIMUS: How do you plan it ?
LUCILLA: The Senate is with us , and the City Guard . We have growing power in the streets . But we need a leader . Someone the people can
MAXIMUS: So the crown passes to your son .
LUCILLA: No . So that my son will be safe . So that we may leave this charnel house forever and never look back . Look into my eyes , Maximus , and elieve what I say to you She rivets him intensely with her eyes .
MAXIMUS: What is your son 's name ?
LUCILLA: Lucius Verus . Like his father .
MAXIMUS: I weep for him .
LUCILLA: Commodus plans to kill you in you next match in the arena . He 's planning something . I will pray fo you . As I have always done .
CASSIUS: in his majestic charity the Emperor has deigned to this day favor the people of Rome with an historical final match . Returning to the Colosseum today after five years in retirement Caesar is pleased to bring you THE ONLY
PROXIMO: Gods ! That old Homicide ! The Emperor must truly hate you .
MAXIMUS: What can you tell me ?
PROXIMO: He cheats .
CASSIUS: And from the rocky promontories and martial bloodlines of Spain epresenting the training lyceum of Proximo Antoninus I give you
LUCIUS' VOICE: Is it true you 're a General ?
MAXIMUS: I was a General .
LUCIUS: I saw you fight . The Carthage attle too . I 've never seen so much courage .
MAXIMUS: It does n't take courage to kill .
LUCIUS: My father was killed . A beat .
MAXIMUS: I 'm sorry .
LUCIUS: He still comes to me in my dreams . Do you have a father ?
MAXIMUS: I had a father . He was n't really my father but I cared for him very much .
LUCIUS: I hope he comes to you in you dreams . My father and I ride horses in mine .
LUCILLA: Lucius , run along now . I need to talk to the General .
MAXIMUS: Where is my army ?
LUCILLA: Maximus will summon his army from Ostia and he will strike from the inside as his army strikes from the outside . But he insists that the Senate be present .
GAIUS: We 've been ordered to attend .
LUCILLA: How many are with us ?
GRACCHUS: About half . But once the tyrant is dead . All . A beat .
LUCILLA: I 'll arrange it .
GAIUS: And what of the Emperor ? A beat .
LUCILLA: He has withdrawn . He 's not eating . He does n't go out . He wo n't even see me I do n't know what tempests age within him but
GRACCHUS: We should fear for the blackest storm .
LUCILLA: Yes . A beat .
GAIUS: One question who is to be the actual Regicide ? A beat . She glances at him . The drums continue
VIBIUS: You did n't kill him .
MAXIMUS: I will not kill another warrior . There is no honor to it .
KIDS: Maximus the Merciful ! Maximus the Merciful ! The drums continue
MAXIMUS: Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus ' festival .
LUCILLA: And they will march on Rome for you ?
MAXIMUS: Yes . But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus , no one else .
LUCILLA: Captain Marcellus will take it . And his City Guard will by with you when you get to Rome . Is that enough to face the Praetorian Guard ?
MAXIMUS: The Felix Regiment will never be defeated . A beat .
GRACCHUS: I only have one question for you , General Why ? A beat .
MAXIMUS: I want Commodus dead .
GRACCHUS: That 's not the reason . Tell me the truth . A beat .
MAXIMUS: Because one night an old man whispered to me about a dream . I will die for that dream . A long beat .
GRACCHUS: I knew the old man well . And I loved him very much . In our youth we would spend hours building that dream together . After he went to the wars and lost his way I was very cruel . I tormented him to emember that dream we spoke of .
MAXIMUS: He did .
GRACCHUS: You can have no idea how much that means to me . A beat .
CENTURION: Madame , the Emperor would like to see you .
LUCILLA: Caesar He turns . She stops .
COMMODUS: I am sorry to have kept you away I needed this time to think
LUCILLA: Of course
COMMODUS: I limited my world to these fou walls so as to let my mind free again and again my mind settles on ut one question What kind of world are we making when the people of Rome prefer a slave in the arena to their father ?
LUCILLA: Brother , do not be influenced by the mob . They are a great , faceless east
COMMODUS: They are not `` the mob , '' Lucilla , they are the people . They are my children and all I want to do is love them .
LUCILLA: They see themselves in him . They throw in their own sad dreams alongside his . They think he fights for them .
COMMODUS: And what do I do but fight fo them ? ! I give them games to please them . I strangle dissent to give them peace . I empower the Praetorians to give them order . What more can I do ? ! A beat .
LUCILLA: And what if he should win ? A beat .
COMMODUS: A God is more powerful than a man
LUCILLA: Caesar , you let this unduly worry you . At best he is a passing fancy he is a name , an image on a anner , ephemeral he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears
COMMODUS: But I need to know why do they love him ?
LUCILLA: Mercy . He stops . Looks at her .
COMMODUS: And for that moment in the arena they are merciful too . For a moment they are Gods . Offering life . He looks at her .
MAXIMUS: As will I , Commodus . As will I .
COMMODUS: As the first act of my contrition I offer you the wooden sword of freedom . He holds out the wooden sword . A beat .
MAXIMUS: I only have ancestors because of you , brother . You killed everything that ever lived alongside me . A beat .
COMMODUS: Take it , Maximus . Let us heal that fatal wound together .
MAXIMUS: This is the new home you cursed me to . And I am safer here from you treachery than I could ever be outside .
COMMODUS: Will you always mistrust me ?
MAXIMUS: Why do n't you ask your father that ?
COMMODUS: You think this is power ? I could show you power , slave
MAXIMUS: No , Caesar I will show you .
VIBIUS: We 'll be killed .
MAXIMUS: Probably . A beat .
JUBA: And if we die that day we die free men worthy of our ancestors .
VIBIUS: You did n't know my ancestors . A otten bunch . Maximus points to the huge statue of Mars .
MAXIMUS: Then be worthy of him . The old Titan who would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and fat .
JUBA: And impotent . A beat . Vibius thinks about it .
VIBIUS: If I die , I want a hundred whores at my funeral .
COMMODUS: Where is my sister ?
HANDMAIDEN: She 's out , sir
COMMODUS: Where ?
HANDMAIDEN: I do n't know , Caesar . Commodus looks at her for a moment .
COMMODUS: Where is my sister ?
MAXIMUS: Was it Centurion ? General ?
PROXIMO: Captain . A beat .
MAXIMUS: A soldier knows a soldier . A beat .
PROXIMO: All that was a long time ago . Too much wine and too many women . And too much money .
MAXIMUS: No
PROXIMO: This is who I am You see ? There was a time I would stand against ten men and never give an inch , spitting into the jaws of Hades all the while . There was a time my heart swelled to strap on the armor of Rome . But now
MAXIMUS: You said something to me once . You said in this life , we all die . All we can choose is how we die . And how we are remembered . Do you ecall those words ?
PROXIMO: Yes .
MAXIMUS: Then be remembered proudly . This is your time , Proximo . Stand at my side and be what you were . What you truly are . One last time . A beat .
PROXIMO: You might have spared yourself the speech , General . The lady Lucilla ought all my gladiators two hours ago !
MAXIMUS: You pox-ridden bastard !
PROXIMO: I am the richest trainer in the Empire ! And I will let my gladiators do anything you like ! Conspire away , General ! Maximus can only laugh as well .
MAXIMUS: A quarter ? !
PROXIMO: A third . And not a hair more . And you 'll have to start in the provinces ! Cleaning up the lion shit !
MAXIMUS: You know , if you were half so awful as you pretend , you 'd be a terrifying man . Maximus shakes his head , smiling , and goes . Proximo sits for a moment .
LUCILLA: Do n't even say it . I know it 's dangerous but I had to see you . Captain Marcellus has gone to the army with your message as you instructed .
MAXIMUS: Good .
LUCILLA: He says the City Guard will be ready at the south road at noon . They can only wait for an hour so
MAXIMUS: You 've told me this already .
LUCILLA: Did I ? All right then . So everything is prepared . The Senate will be in attendance and you have your gladiators the usual cohort of Praetorians will be inside the arena
MAXIMUS: Lucilla why are you here ? A pause .
LUCILLA: Tell me honestly please do you think it will work ? A beat .
MAXIMUS: No .
LUCILLA: Do you think we 'll all die ?
MAXIMUS: Yes . She leans against a wall . A pause .
LUCILLA: Will you swear something to me ?
MAXIMUS: Yes .
LUCILLA: Will you swear it on the memory of your son ? A long beat .
MAXIMUS: Yes .
LUCILLA: By all that you have ever loved swear that if you survive you will take my son out of Rome . Swear that you will go far away and neve eturn . He steps to her .
MAXIMUS: I will . A beat .
LUCILLA: I will .
MAXIMUS: Shhh my heart breaks enough . He holds her closely , tenderly .
COMMODUS: Sister join us . I 've been eading to dear Lucius .
LUCIUS: I 've been reading too .
COMMODUS: Yes , he 's a very smart little boy . He 'll make a grand Emperor one day . Lucilla has not moved .
LUCIUS: She killed herself with a snake !
COMMODUS: And just wait until you hear what happened to some of our othe ancestors ! If you 're very good , tomorrow night I 'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius . He was etrayed ! By those closest to him by his own blood they whispered in dark corners and went out late at night and conspired and conspired Lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill .
LUCIUS: I do n't know , Uncle .
COMMODUS: The bee told him everything . Lucilla 's face is tortured .
PROXIMO: Release them ! Release them all !
MAXIMUS: But
PROXIMO: If you want to live follow me
VIBIUS: Go , Spaniard ! We 'll show these Roman dogs how gladiators fight !
PROXIMO: All the old gladiator schools have tunnels to the Colosseum most have long since collapsed
JUBA: How did they know ?
MAXIMUS: We were betrayed .
JUBA: I 'll stay here . In case they follow . Maximus stops as well .
PROXIMO: Quickly
MAXIMUS: You 're not coming ?
PROXIMO: They are killing my men ! He races back into the tunnel .
LUCIUS: What is that fire ?
COMMODUS: Why that 's a bonfire , Lucius . I arranged it just for you . He puts his hand on the boy 's shoulder .
PRAETORIAN: Caesar
COMMODUS: Oh that 's for my sister .
TITUS: By all the Gods He goes to Maximus and embraces him .
MAXIMUS: Old friend
TITUS: You 're returned from Hades ! By all the Gods !
MAXIMUS: Where is he ?

From this day forth let it be known that I , Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus , have surmounted mortality . That I , Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus , assume my destined place at the side of the Gods .
MAXIMUS: Throw down your weapons or we will kill you . A beat .
COMMODUS: As it was at the beginning so is it now . The great She-Wolf of Rome will again suckle us , again ravage our enemies AND BRING US A WORLD

SIMON: That 's nothing .
RONNA: More than I got .
SIMON: I 'll give you twenty right now for a lowjob .

MANNIE: Nice . Robert Mitchum .
RONNA: Shit ! M. M. MMMMMMMMalcolm X .
CLAIRE: You ca n't say Malcolm X .
RONNA: He 's famous , he 's dead .
MANNIE: That 's like a rule or something . Nothing starts with X . He puts the tub back on the shelf .
RONNA: That 's not my problem .
MANNIE: You can challenge .
CLAIRE: Okay , I challenge . Give me one dead celebrity that starts with X .
SWITTERMAN: Break was over four minutes ago . Who 's up front ?

ADAM: Does a British guy still work here ?
RONNA: He went to Vegas for the weekend .
ADAM: Betcha wonder why we 're buying all this orange juice .
RONNA: Scurvy ?
ZACK: Say Ronna . You do n't know where we could get something to go with this orange juice , do you ?
RONNA: Doughnuts , aisle four .
ZACK: But then you get the weird taste in you mouth . I was thinking something a little more euphoric . The British guy usually hooks us up . She stops bagging . Looks at Adam . At Zack .
RONNA: How much ?
ZACK: Twenty at twenty .
RONNA: You 're overpaying .
ZACK: We 're desperate . A bunch of us are going to this party tonight , this warehouse thing

MANNIE: Todd GAINES ?
CLAIRE: Who 's Todd Gaines ?
MANNIE: Simon 's dealer .
CLAIRE: You ca n't do that , can you ? I mean , go around Simon . She looks at Mannie . He shrugs , unsure .
RONNA: Ok , listen up . If Simon were here which he 's not he would charge fifteen , when I know he gets it for ten .
MANNIE: But it 's like an evolutionary leap . You 're moving up the drug food chain . Without permission .
CLAIRE: Ronna , you should n't do this .
RONNA: Both of you chill the fuck out . It 's just once . When Simon gets back , we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy . But this is my deal , so just sit back and watch .
GAINES: Nah .
RONNA: I keep him honest .
GAINES: At that level you 're supposed to pinch . It 's the economics of it .
GAINES: You leaving ?
RONNA: I need a favor .
GAINES: A favor ? Wow . I did n't know we were such good friends , Ronna . Because if we were , you would know I give head before I give favors . I do n't even give my best friends head , so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim . You might try just telling me what you want to buy .
RONNA: Twenty hits of ecstacy .
GAINES: You come here out of the blue asking fo twenty hits . Just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to sell ecomes trafficking .
RONNA: Todd , I would never fuck you like that .

RONNA: There 's this big Christmas party thing . Warehouse , you know . A bunch of us are doing sort of a pre-party thing .
GAINES: Friends of yours . You 're not going to go and try to sell this on me , are you ?
RONNA: No .
GAINES: You 're not dealing .
RONNA: Swear to God .
GAINES: This is the real thing . Pharmaceutical grade , not that crunchy herbal rave shit . Do n't let anyone double dose or you 'll be frying eggs off ` em in the emergency room . One hit per headbanger .
RONNA: Understood . He snaps the cap on tight .
GAINES: Twenty at fifteen is 300 .
RONNA: Fifteen ? I was thinking more like ten .
GAINES: You already did strap it on .
RONNA: It 's just that I know you charge Simon ten .
GAINES: Inflation 's a bitch .
RONNA: Here 's the deal . There 's 20 of us . I need all of this . But I only have two hundred . I mean , that 's all I have .
GAINES: See , that would be doing you a favor , and you know how I feel about favors .
RONNA: I could leave something with you . Collateral . He gives her a quick look over .
GAINES: I already got a fucking Swatch . I need something I know you 'll come back for .
RONNA: Claire , could you come up with me for a sec ?
CLAIRE: Hello ! He 's a drug dealer .
RONNA: Jesus , Claire . Do n't get 818 on me here . How much shit have I done for you ? This is nothing .

ZACK: So this party tonight sounds like it 's gon na be huge .
ADAM: Massive .
ZACK: That would be a synonym for huge .
ADAM: Just backing you up .
ZACK: And I appreciate that .
BURKE: Cerveza ? He hands her a beer .
ADAM: Oh yeah . Hey . We bought a whole bunch of orange juice . It 's in the car .

RONNA: I think it was Simon they were after . He deals all the time out of the store . I mean , he makes change out of the fucking egister .
MANNIE: They did n't know who was dealing , just that it was someone at the store ?
RONNA: They were fishing . I bit .
MANNIE: We go back to Todd . Tell him they did n't show up , whatever . And then just swap the pills for Claire .
RONNA: We ca n't .

MARCUS: Dude , you passed out before we left L.A .
TINY: Pop ! Goes the asshole .
SINGH: She actually found your dick ?
TINY: Then she starts going around the ouside you know , painting the treewhen WHACK ! It hits her in the eye . And her contact , it 's like stuck on my dick . The passengers do n't seem impressed .
MARCUS: Was it hard or soft ?
TINY: What , my dick ?
SINGH: The contact lens .
MARCUS: Do you remember if it was a colored lens ? That she used to have two blue eyes and now she had one blue and one brown ?
TINY: What the fuck does that matter ?
MARCUS: It matters because it happened to me . It was my story . I told this story about a year ago . The difference was , I knew those small-but-important details . That , and it was true .
TINY: Oh . Whatever .
MARCUS: Whatever ?
TINY: Whatever .
MARCUS: What nigger ? This nigger ?
TINY: My mother 's mother 's mother was black .
MARCUS: So you say , yet we have never seen a picture of this Ebonic woman .
SINGH: Stop . Truce .
MARCUS: If you were any less black , you would be clear .
SIMON: Stop .
MARCUS: Look at your skin .
TINY: I see black because I know I am . Color is a state of mind .
MARCUS: Thank you Rhythm Nation .
SIMON: So what does Valentina do ?
MARCUS: She 's a nutritionist . She also teaches a class at this college .
SIMON: What class ?
MARCUS: Tantric sexuality for couples .
SINGH: She teaches people how to fuck ?
TINY: Man , I taught myself .
MARCUS: You should n't eat shrimp . It 's loaded with iodine .
TINY: This shit is expensive . You 're paying five bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit .
MARCUS: Thing is , most people really do n't know how to make love . They just put it in and move it around until they get off . What tantra teaches you is how to prolong and deepen the experience , bring it to a higher level . If one man in ten were having the sex I 'm having , there would be no war .
SIMON: What 's the longest you and her ever did it ?
MARCUS: Fourteen hours .
SINGH: Holy shit !
TINY: How many times you shoot ?
MARCUS: Not once .
SIMON: Fourteen hours , you did n't go once . Not even at the end ?
MARCUS: You redirect the orgasm inside . He 's greeted with skeptical looks . MARCUS How long does your orgasm last ? A couple seconds ? I 've had orgasms that lasted an hour and a half .
SIMON: Bullshit .
MARCUS: Swear to God . And I do mean Allah .
SINGH: When was the last time you got off ? I mean like , wet .
MARCUS: I have n't ejaculated in six months .
TINY: Six months !
MARCUS: Anyone can do it . All it takes is discipline .
TINY: You are some kind of Obi Wan Kenobi motherfucker .
MARCUS: Todd Gaines . The drug dealer .
SIMON: He gets a discount . He let me use it . He 's a good guy .
MARCUS: He 's the good drug dealer . I get confused .
SIMON: We 'll pay cash anyway . This is just to get the room . The Desk Woman returns with their keys .
DESK WOMAN: I think my manager would be better able to answer that question . Would you like me to call him over ?
SIMON: No . Not necessary .
DESK WOMAN: Great then . Welcome to the Riviera . Simon walks away with Marcus .
SIMON: Lesbian .
MARCUS: Did I tell you not to eat the shrimp ?
SINGH: I have something for you . Where did I put it ? Oh , it 's right here .
SIMON: Todd , it 's Simon . What 's up ? I 'm in Vegas , we just got here . What was the name of the place you said we should goThe Crazy Horse . What are you doing tonight ?
BOY: Who are you ?
MARCUS: This is our room . Simon leans around to look .
BOY: Oh . What are you doing ?
SIMON: Raping small children .
MARCUS: No .
SIMON: There 's a reason . The elevator bell BINGS .
MARCUS: Where 's your money ?
SIMON: I lost it
MARCUS: We 've been here five minutes .
SIMON: I was playing this game at a hundred dollar table and I did n't understand it , ut now I do . I think I figured out how to beat it .
MARCUS: Let me see your wallet .
MARCUS: You can have it back in an hour . No , no . No buts . One hour , right here .
BECKY: Okay , if you 're from over there , then where did you meet these friends ? Of yours . Who I do n't see .
SIMON: They already knew each utter , but Marcus I met in traffic school .
REBECCA: Een traffic skewl ?
SIMON: I 'm a good driver , I am . I learned everything from American television . Hunter , Magnum P.I . The Knight Rider is an excellent program .
REBECCA: Do you want to be getting high with us ?
BECKY: Otherwise , I ca n't hold it in . Simon hands her the pipe and the lighter .
REBECCA: You 're fine . You 're fine . Becky is crying .
SIMON: You 're beautiful .
BECKY: Did you go ? He shakes his head .
SIMON: Tantra , baby .
MARCUS: I am not a bathroom attendant !
SIMON: Hey . We 're leaving .
MARCUS: Fuck yeah .
FERRARI MAN: Keep it close and there 's an extra ten ucks for you .
MARCUS: Get in . Get in the car . Get in .
SIMON: Question . When you 're doing tantra , you hold it in at the end , right ?
MARCUS: No . Never . Redirect the energy , but you never hold it in . Have n't you ever gotten lue balls ? Hurts like a bitch .
SIMON: Sort of a dull ache .
MARCUS: Exactly .
SIMON: Orange County .
MARCUS: Do n't point it at me !
SIMON: How do I know if it 's loaded ?
MARCUS: First , you stop pointing it at me .
SIMON: I 've never held a real gun before . It 's heavier than I thought .
MARCUS: Great , put it back .
SIMON: I want to know if it 's loaded . How do
MARCUS: Hold the wheel .
SIMON: I hold ten men 's lives in my hand .
MARCUS: It 's a nine millimeter . It does n't have stopping power .
SIMON: Right . For that you 'd need Magnum Force .
MARCUS: eagle
SIMON: or the automobile . America is about a man and a gun .
MARCUS: The N-R-A . He tears a page out of the phone book .
SIMON: You 're certain ?
MARCUS: The E.R.A . was this chick thing in the ` 70s .
SIMON: Chicks with guns ? A beat . Giving up
MARCUS: Yes .
SINGH: Kill me .
TINY: I ai n't your bitch . Kill yourself .
BOY: You got some smoke ?
TINY: You got some pubic hair yet ?
BOY: Man , I 've been smoking up since I was eight .
TINY: Where is your mom at ? He pushes past the kid
BOY: She 's not my mom .
TINY: I 'm kicking your ass if you knock again .
BOY: Fuck you .
MARCUS: Listen up . They 're going to ask if you want buy a bottle of champagne . You do n't , but do n't say that right off .
SIMON: Explain .
MARCUS: Champagne means you want a private dance . You ca n't afford it , neither can I . But if they know we 're not biting , they do n't even dangle the bait .
SIMON: So , `` champagne '' is a code . What does vodka mean ?
MARCUS: Nothing .
SIMON: I 'd like to buy your most expensive bottle of champagne .
MARCUS: Yes .
SIMON: Crystal .
NOELLE: Hands ! Hands !
MARCUS: Yo . Yo ! He fucked up , he lost control .
MARCUS: Enough ! Stop kicking him . I said to fucking stop kicking him .
SIMON: Everybody back the fuck away . They do . Marcus holds his place .
MARCUS: Oh , man . Fuck .

HOLLY: Behind you .
VICTOR: What happened !
HOLLY: They shot Vic . They went out the back .
VICTOR: Find them .
HOLLY: Call 911 .
VICTOR: No ! No cops .
MARCUS: What are you doing ?
SIMON: Getting rid of the weapon . Marcus slams on the brakes .
MARCUS: It has your fingerprints on it .
SIMON: Oh shit .
MARCUS: It 's probably Orange County asking where the hell his car is .
SIMON: It 's a cell phone . They can trace where we are even if we do n't answer .
MARCUS: Get the gun . Go . Find it .
VICTOR: Just because a rapper has a white buddy does n't mean he 's Sidney Fucking Poitier . You check them . You pat them down .
HOLLY: They said they were from Los Angeles . Noelle nods .
VICTOR: Then they must be staying somewhere , is n't that right Noelle ? Noelle nods harder , crying again .
ANNOUNCER [V.O.]: Steve decided to try his hand at craps .
TINY: Yo ! Mmmhmm . Room 875 . He hangs up .
SINGH: Who was that ?
TINY: Some shit , I dunno .
VICTOR: Motherfucker !
THE MAN: The other one , honey .
THE WOMAN: Sure is a fun way to spend Christmas , is n't it ? No answer . The doors open .
THE MAN: Maybe we 're five .
THE WOMAN: Or six . We 'll try both .
MARCUS: All right , listen up . We 're leaving in 30 seconds . Grab what you can .
TINY: What the fuck ?
MARCUS: Just do it . Now !
TINY: Hey . Kid .
BOY: Fuck you .
TINY: Look , I 'm really sorry , you know ? It 's just , it would be really swell if you would open this door . Now . It 's kind of an emergency .
BOY: Hundred bucks .
TINY: Fuck !
SIMON: Give him the money . He gathers money from their wallets .
TINY: Fuck !
SINGH: They 're in .
MARCUS: If you let them in here , they will kill you . Understood ?
BOY: Down the hall . That way .
SIMON: I got ` em .
MARCUS: They 're right behind us .
TINY: Who ?
MARCUS: Cop . Cop !
SIMON: How did they find us ?
MARCUS: It 's their town . I 'm sure they have people .
MARCUS: We have to get off the major streets . Take a right up here . No , not here !
SIMON: Hold on .
TINY: Mother of fuck !
SINGH: I do n't see ` em .
MARCUS: Shit .
SINGH: Wait , no . They 're coming in .
MARCUS: We ca n't make it !
VICTOR: Sonofabitch !
SINGH: Just so we 're clear . You stole a car , shot a bouncer , and had sex with two women ?
TINY: You had sex with two women ?
SIMON: We can be in Mexico by noon . I say we split up from there . I 'll take Baja .
MARCUS: Fuck Mexico . We 're going home . To L.A .
SINGH: Simon , think about it . If they were going to call the cops , they would have called them in Las Vegas . They just wanted us gone , and we 're gone . It 's over .
VICTOR: Tommy , it 's Vic . I need you to run a credit card for me . You ready ? He takes the gold card from his pocket .
CLAIRE: Do n't .
SIMON: Why not ?
CLAIRE: She 's been on for fourteen hours .
ZACK: Do n't forget , detective . I was cleared of all charges .
ADAM: I do n't care how many high-priced lawyers you bring in . Eden Valley will neve stand for your kind of scum .
BURKE: You work out , do n't you ?
ADAM: You have to . It 's in the contract .
BURKE: No , you have a great body .
BURKE: Hey ! People in here !
ZACK: Just so we 're clear . Whether you get something on this guy or not , Adam and I are done today . Finished . Charges dropped . That 's how it works , right ? Burke smiles , an amused roll of the eyes .
BURKE: Seems to me , if a guy 's so concerned about the legal process , how come he finds himself getting busted for possession ? Adam and Zack share a look . A beat .
ADAM: Is it safe to have a radio against my alls like this ? A beat .
LOOP: Safe enough .
BURKE: Tell them what your girlfriend does .
LOOP: She does n't do anything .
BURKE: They 're not even married and she does nothing . My wife we 've been married two years she still takes overtime three nights a week . Loop bows to Burke 's superiority .
BURKE [CONT'D]: My wife 's a deputy sherriff , you believe that ? A cop and a sherriff , married . It 's like the freakin ' odd couple .
ZACK: I smell a pilot .
BURKE: You guys got girlfriends ? What am I saying ? You got ta lot of girlfriends do n't you ? You got women sending you their panties . Two good- looking guys What do you say ?
LOOP: Pussy magnets .
BURKE: If I was not a happily married man I would be ubbing up against you to get some of that . Some of the pussy power . Zack offers Loop a napkin . He passes .
ADAM: Actually , I 'm settled down . Four years now .
LOOP: No ring .
ADAM: Nothing legal .
BURKE: How about you ?
ZACK: Same .
BURKE: This is a crime . You two should be out getting laid .
ADAM: Star light , star bright first star that I see tonight
BURKE: That 's good . I 'm getting him .
ZACK: About five-eight , brown hair , blue eyes .
BURKE: Hot .
ZACK: Yeah .
BURKE: She faithful ?
ZACK: No . I do n't think so .
BURKE: You faithful ?
ZACK: Not anymore .
BURKE: Zack 's girlfriend is fucking around on him .
LOOP: Man , I 'm sorry . How did you find out ? ON ADAM , corner of his eye .
ZACK: It 's no bigI do n't really want to get into it .
LOOP: C'mon , tell us .
ADAM: Absolutely . Tell us .
ZACK: I found socks .
BURKE: What , red socks , blue socks ?
ZACK: White socks . You know how the good kind of socks have band around the ankle that keeps them from stretching out ? When I moved in , every one of the socks had that . Suddenly , there was one sock that did n't .
BURKE: You hear that ? We got John Sherlock Holmes in the car here . We pull into the parking lot of
ADAM: Alright . But you 've been fucking around , too .
ZACK: Only after I found out .
ADAM: Huh .
ZACK: No , Adam . I do not . I have suspicions . Mostly former boyfriends who keep calling .
ADAM: What a coincidence . I have the exact same problem with my girlfriend . In fact , I think she 's been sleeping around on me , too .
ZACK: Is n't it ironic .
ADAM: Do n't you think ? Maybe I should start checking for socks , too . Zack 's glare could strip paint .
CLAIRE: Gay men are so hot . It 's tragic .
ADAM: He 's not here . What are we supposed to do ? He 's not here .
ZACK: We 're going to ask . You 're going to ask .
ADAM: Why me ?
ZACK: You look more wholesome . Just improv .
ADAM: Who are you calling ?
ZACK: Nobody . I 'm giving you an opening .
ADAM: He was n't there . The British guy , he was n't there .
LOOP: No , we heard . You guys did great .
BURKE: This chick Ronna . You think she can score ?
ADAM: Maybe .
ZACK: Probably .
BURKE: Then that 's all we need . It 's all connected . The circle of life .
ZACK: So if she gets the stuff , what , you arrest her ?
BURKE: We try to bring her over . See , we arrest her and then what ? One crack whore off the street . So we cut he a deal . She helps us get this guy . We cut him a deal . He helps us get the guy above him . It 's just like what happened with you .
ZACK: So , sooner or later , everybody 's working for The Man .
BURKE: Exactly .
LOOP: She 's coming up . Burke cracks his neck , showtime .
ZACK: What if she is n't really a dealer though ? If you just pulled her into this one thing , would n't that be entrapment ?
BURKE: If she 's making this deal , she 's a dealer . Does n't matter if its her first or he last . We stay on Zack , unconvinced .
ADAM: Oh yeah . Hey . We bought a whole bunch of orange juice . It 's in the car .
BURKE: Now , Zack tells me you got 20 at 20 , is that right ?
RONNA: You got a bathroom ?
ADAM: Down the hall on the right .
ZACK: Let me show you
ZACK: Go . Ronna sees it . Her eyes go wider . Zack nods .
BURKE: Now watch what I do with his wrist . I twist it away while I put on the second cuff . That way he ca n't go after me . He does n't have any leverage .
LOOP: Full hands .
BURKE: What ? A beat . Loop ca n't remember what it was .
LOOP: Nothing . I 'm out of it . Merry Christmas , guys . Good to meet you .
ZACK: We 're done , now , right ? That 's what we talked about . Whether or not the deal went through , we just had to do our part .
BURKE: You did your part .
ZACK: Great . Well , hey . A pleasure .
BURKE: Now that he 's gone , there 's something I wanted to ask you guys about . Sort of a proposition . See , my wife and I Irene , she 's my wife we 're both working on Christmas so we 're gon na have Christmas dinne tonight . And I was thinking , maybe you guys would want to come over , eat some dinner with us . My wife is great , you 'll love her , then I 'll sign your form . How does that sound ? A beat .
ZACK: Actually , you know , I had plans .
ADAM: You did ?
ZACK: I do .
ADAM: With your girlfriend ?
ZACK: Yes , Adam , in fact . With my girlfriend .
ADAM: Huh . Wow , I ca n't believe I forgot this . I saw your girlfriend this morning , and she asked me to tell you that she could n't make your plans tonight .
ADAM: It looks like we 're both free .
IRENE: Yes ? Hi ?
ADAM: Sorry . Phone . Messages . Check ?
IRENE: Here .
ADAM: They 're singing Christmas carols . My family . Minnesota , they do that .
ZACK: Sorry .
BURKE: No , stay for a sec . Burke sprays more cologne on his hand .
ZACK: Really .
BURKE: I get this for a quarter what that stuff costs .
ZACK: It 's nice .
BURKE: Here .
ZACK: It is soft .
BURKE: Get on .
ZACK: That 's okay . Burke pushes Zack back flat the bed .
BURKE: Did you hear that ?
ZACK: Hear what ?
BURKE: Exactly . Individually wrapped springs . Top quality . Burke climbs onto the bed beside him .
ZACK: I sure would n't . A beat .
BURKE: So , Zack . Would you say you 're open to new things ?
IRENE: Of course you like your job . You get to kiss all those pretty girls .
ADAM: It does have perks .
IRENE: Tell me something . When you kiss those girls , you 're not really kissing them , are you ?
ADAM: It 's a stage kiss . Your lips touch , but there 's no tongue .
IRENE: There 's no feeling . Nobody gets jealous .
ADAM: It 's acting . It 's not real .
IRENE: What goes with turkey ?
BURKE: More wine ?
ZACK: No . He does n't want any more . Unless he does , do you ?
ADAM: No .
ZACK: This has been great , just wonderful , but we 're going to need to leave . Soon . Adam 's not feeling well .
ADAM: I 'm not . It 's true . Burke and Irene share a look .
BURKE: If you got ta go , then I understand . But Irene and I sort of had an ulterio motive inviting you here . Zack looks to Adam .
IRENE: He makes it sound sinister . It 's not .
BURKE: She 's right . Okay , you 've looked around our place . Where do you think we got most of this stuff ? Adam and Zack shake their heads .
IRENE: Just guess .
ADAM: Sears ?
ZACK: J.C. Penney 's ? Irene and Burke both smile .
BURKE: It 's actually from Confederated Products . Almost everything in this house is from Confederated Products , from the toilet paper to the mattress to those candles .
IRENE: The wine .
BURKE: Even that cologne you liked . See , Confederated Products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company . That means we do n't just sell the products ourselves , we also recruit and manage teams who work under us . Irene and I started eight months ago and we 're already bringing in fifty thousand a yea in revenues .
IRENE: We 're the number four distributor in Southern California . By March , we might e number three .
BURKE: Now , as law enforcement officers , Irene and I ca n't recruit distributors from inside the force . It 's against the rules and we 'd get fired . So what we do is look for people in other industries
IRENE: like the entertainment industry .
ZACK: Wait . You want us to sell Amway .
BURKE: Confederated Products . It 's a different company , different quality of product .
ZACK: I need to do something terrifically unwholesome . I need to bathe in sin .
ADAM: With me , or one of your other boyfriends ?
ZACK: I have cheated on you with exactly one guy .
ADAM: Ditto .
ZACK: Who ?
ADAM: No . See , if I tell you , you will freak out and it will be drama . Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not up for it . He finds the right brand .
ZACK: I 'll tell you mine .
ADAM: No .
ZACK: Why not ?
ADAM: You ca n't wait to tell me , can you ? You 're gloating . You think yours is etter than mine .
ZACK: I do n't .
ADAM: It 's Sean Connery , is n't it ?
ZACK: Count of three .
ADAM: Alright . Sure . Wait . Okay .
ZACK: Jimmy . Jimmy .
ADAM: Is Jimmy here ?
SANDRA: Oh my God . Oh . My God .
SANDRA: I 'll call you back . Jimmy 's not here . He went to this thing . Let me find it .
ZACK: We know .
SANDRA: I take no responsibilty . I was only an innocent bystander . But there was once where you missed each other by three minutes . It was so exciting .
ZACK: Mary Xmas Supafest .
SANDRA: He left an hour ago .
ZACK: Okay , I just have to say this . The thing is , about Jimmy , he was n't even that good .
ADAM: I know .
ZACK: Mediocre at best . And the sounds he made , God . It was like having sex with Nell . Adam imitates the MOAN .
ADAM: And the ear thing . Hello , I have Q-Tips . That 's really not necessary .
ZACK: The only thing I will give him credit fo is the oral .
ADAM: What do you mean ? He was terrible . At some point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique . I had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up . A beat .
ZACK: When was that ?
ADAM: October , maybe ?
ZACK: Early October . And he suddenly got so much better . A beat .
ADAM: That is so disturbing . It 's like you were there .
ZACK: Right . This right . This right ! That was the right you wanted .
ZACK: Oh my God .
ADAM: It'sIt 's that girl .
ZACK: Ronna .
ADAM: What if she 's
ZACK: Go !
ZACK: Let 's think about it logically . Eithe she 's alive , or she 's dead . If she 's dead , then there 's nothing we can do . If she 's alive , then the guy with the gun , who seemed to want to shoot her , probably did shoot her .
ADAM: So even if she 's alive , she 's dead .
ZACK: Exactly . Adam takes another drink .
ADAM: A girl is dead .
ZACK: I did n't say it went perfectly .
ADAM: Hello , they could have been recording it . Everything we said could be on tape somewhere . They would know we did it . A beat .
ZACK: What if we were just running lines ? For a scene ?
ADAM: They will .
ZACK: No . Listen . If there 's no body , there 's no crime .
ADAM: What ?
ZACK: It 's a Miata .
ADAM: Where will IOr you
ZACK: In the passenger seat . Holding her up . Adam shudders at the thought .
ADAM: I ca n't .
ZACK: What do you mean ?
ADAM: I ca n't do this .
ZACK: Okay , listen to me
ADAM: She 's dead .
ZACK: She 's not dead .
ADAM: She 's dead . I hit her and I killed her .
ZACK: No you did n't , okay ? This is all just make-believe . This is a scene . She 's just acting dead . And you 're just acting scared . Adam laughs to himself , still crying .
ADAM: Hi , Michelle .
ZACK: The craft service truck is right around the corner , and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill . And you can have one if you just help me finish this scene . Can you smell them ? Can you smell them on the grill ? A beat .
ADAM: I 'm not delusional .
ZACK: Then take her fucking arms !
ADAM: She 's not dead .
ZACK: No shit !
ADAM: If she 's not dead , that means we did n't kill her . We can just leave her .
ZACK: She 's almost dead . We leave her and she dies , why did we bother coming back ? I mean , you still killed her .
ADAM: What do you mean , I killed her ?
ZACK: Christ , I did n't mean it that way . C'mon . I would never testify against you . Adam is not reassured .
ADAM: In Plan A she was dead .
ZACK: Okay . New plan .
FILA GUY: Hey , it 's Kelly . Somebody beat the crap out of her . Moving to find
ZACK: Look , she 's fine . They 're getting an ambulance . She 's fine .
ADAM: What about that guy ? The guy with the gun . He could still go after her .
ZACK: Okay , listen . Girl in ditch that 's ou problem . Girl out of ditch that 's he own problem . We 're done . We did the ight thing . Thunder RUMBLES overhead . Off Adam 's look
ADAM: Home .
WAITER: Anywhere you want .
CLAIRE: I 'm meeting people .
GAINES: Hey .
CLAIRE: We 're twins .
CLAIRE: Have you seen Ronna ? Or Mannie ? He shakes his head .
CLAIRE: Unless you wanted to eat alone .
GAINES: No . It 's fine .
CLAIRE: What do you have against The Family Circus ?
GAINES: It 's evil .
CLAIRE: Besides that .
GAINES: Okay . Location mostly . Bottom right corner , just waiting there to suck . It 's the last thing you read , and it spoils everything you read before it .
CLAIRE: You could just not read it .
GAINES: I hate it , yet I 'm uncontrollably drawn to it . Are you going to
CLAIRE: Do you know what I like about you ?
GAINES: What ?
CLAIRE: I 'm asking . I do n't know . It 's not you face , because you 're only medium cute . I think what it is , is you might be the first non-fake person I 've met here .
GAINES: Me .
CLAIRE: I 'm serious .
GAINES: Professional curiousity . What are you on ?
CLAIRE: Ginseng and lotsa caffeine . Gaines leaves money for the check .
CLAIRE: You know what I like best about Christmas ? The surprises . It 's like , you get this ox , and you 're sure you know what 's in it . You shake it , you weigh it , and you 're totally convinced you have it pegged . No doubt in your mind . But then you open it up , and it 's something completely different . Bing ! Wow ! Bang ! Surprise ! I mean , it 's like you and me here . She smiles . She has a bewitching smile .
GAINES: How did you get out ?
VICTOR: How was your drive ? We flew .
SIMON: in the arm .
VICTOR: Justice . A look between all parties .
SIMON: It 's all flesh here , it should be okay .
GAINES: Be good !
SIMON [O.S.]: I 'm okay !
RONNA: Hey .
RONNA: Okay , real mature .
RONNA [CONT'D]: But it was n't exactly a banner night fo me , either .
CLAIRE: You are constantly using us .
RONNA: Using you ? You use me . Come on , if it were n't for me , you would be sitting home every night eating popcorn and watching reruns of 90210 .
CLAIRE: Mannie is your chauffeur , and I am I am some chick you leave sitting in an apartment .
RONNA: That is such bullshit . Mannie does not feel that way . Ask him . Ask him ! Where is he ?
CLAIRE: Why would I know ?
RONNA: He drove you here , did n't he ?
CLAIRE: No , I got a ride . His car was still in the parking lot when I left .
RONNA: Oh shit . Shit !
CLAIRE: Mannie ! Mannie !
RONNA: Mannie ! Can you hear me ?
MANNIE: You look like shit .
RONNA: You fucked Todd Gaines ?
CLAIRE: No ! We made out .
RONNA: Made out ?
CLAIRE: Kissed . A little . What ?
RONNA: Hello ! He 's a drug dealer .
CLAIRE: Found ` em .
RONNA: You might have brain damage from overdosing .
MANNIE: Dain brambage ? A beat .
RONNA: You shit .
CLAIRE: I 'll drive .
RONNA: And twenty left over . Maybe I 'll open a savings account .
MANNIE: So what are we doing for New Year 's ? Ronna smiles .
RONNA: Merry Christmas , Mannie .
SIMON: Who is it ? He ducks , expecting a hail of gunfire .
JIMMY SHUBERT: Somethin ' about it just did n't add up . So last night I went back to the pie to do some investigating of my own . Turns out there are two boats named the Princess . Only , one just got back from two weeks at sea Sal Dominico 's oat . It got me thinkin ' if Chase eally did know Carmen was on to him , how come he did n't tell Lucas , o Gamble , or Myerson ? Why would he drive up to Pinecliff by himself ? And why would you still have his briefcase ? Answer me that , Danielle . If you have an answer . MUSIC rises , a scene cut . New MUSIC leads into
ZACK: I 'm not the man you 're looking for .
ADAM: We both know you were on the pier . You saw what happened to Carmen .
ZACK: Do n't forget , detective . I was cleared of all charges .
ADAM: I do n't care how many high-priced lawyers you bring in . Eden Valley will neve stand for your kind of scum .
THE GODFATHER: _____________
BONASERA: America has made my fortune .
DON CORLEONE: Bonasera , we know each other fo years , but this is the first time you come to me for help . I do n't emember the last time you invited me to your house for coffeeeven though our wives are friends .
BONASERA: What do you want of me ? I 'll give you anything you want , but do what I ask !
DON CORLEONE: And what is that Bonasera ? BONASERA whispers into the DON 's ear .
BONASERA: I ask for Justice .
DON CORLEONE: The Court gave you justice .
BONASERA: An eye for an eye !
DON CORLEONE: But your daughter is still alive .
BONASERA: Then make them suffer as she suffers . How much shall I pay you . Both HAGEN and SONNY react .
DON CORLEONE: You never think to protect yourself with real friends . You think it 's enough to be an American . All ight , the Police protects you , there are Courts of Law , so you do n't need a friend like me . But now you come to me and say Don Corleone , you must give me justice . And you do n't ask in respect o friendship . And you do n't think to call me Godfather ; instead you come to my house on the day my daughte is to be married and you ask me to do murderfor money .
BONASERA: America has been good to me
DON CORLEONE: Then take the justice from the judge , the bitter with the sweet , Bonasera . But if you come to me with your friendship , your loyalty , then your enemies become my enemies , and then , believe me , they would fear you Slowly , Bonasera bows his head and murmurs .
BONASERA: Be my friend .
DON CORLEONE: Good . From me you 'll get Justice .
BONASERA: Godfather .
DON CORLEONE: Some day , and that day may neve come , I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return .

NAZORINE: An Act of Congress !
HAGEN: It will cost .
NAZORINE: Is that all ? Godfather , thank you Oh , wait till you see the cake I made for your beautiful daughter !

DON CORLEONE: Not to one of our paisansgive it to a Jew Congressman in anothe district . Who else is on the list for today ?
HAGEN: Francesco Nippi . His nephew has een refused parole . A bad case .
DON CORLEONE: Is it necessary ?
HAGEN: You understand him better than anyone .
KAY: I 've never seen anything like it .
MICHAEL: I told you I had a lot of relatives .
KAY: Michael , what are those men doing ?
MICHAEL: They 're waiting to see my father .
KAY: They 're talking to themselves .
MICHAEL: They 're going to talk to my father , which means they 're going to ask him for something , which means they etter get it right .
KAY: Why do they bother him on a day like this ?
MICHAEL: Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter 's wedding day .
CARLO: Cut it out , Connie .
PAULIE: Who knows ? Maybe more . Twenty , thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse . Holy Toledo , if this was somebody else 's wedding !
WOMAN: Is it true what they say about you husband , Sandra ?
KAY: Michael , that scarey guyIs he a elative ? She has picked out LUCA BRASI .
MICHAEL: No . His name is Luca Brasi . You would n't like him .
KAY: Who is he ?
MICHAEL: You really want to know ?
KAY: Yes . Tell me .
MICHAEL: You like spaghetti ?
KAY: You know I love spaghetti .
MICHAEL: Then eat your spaghetti and I 'll tell you a Luca Brasi story . She starts to eat her spaghetti . She begins eating , looking at him eagerly .
KAY: Al Capone !
MICHAEL: My Father sent Luca Brasi afte them . He tied the two Capone men hand and foot , and stuffed small ath towels into their mouths . Then he took an ax , and chopped one man 's feet off
KAY: Michael
MICHAEL: Then the legs at the knees

KAY: Michael , I do n't want to hea anymore
MICHAEL: Then Luca turned to the other man
KAY: Michael , I love you .
MICHAEL: who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated .
KAY: I never know when you 're telling me the truth .
MICHAEL: I told you you would n't like him .

KAY: How do you do .
MICHAEL: My brother , Tom Hagen .
HAGEN: Hello Kay . Your father 's inside , doing some business . He 's been asking for you .
MICHAEL: Thanks Tom .
KAY: If he 's your brother , why does he have a different name ?

LUCA: Don CorleoneI am honored , and gratefulthat you invited me to your homeon the wedding day of yourdaughter . May their first childbe a masculine child . I pledge my neve ending loyalty . For your daughter 's bridal purse .
DON CORLEONE: Thank you , Luca , my most valued friend .
LUCA: Let me leave you , Don Corleone . I know you are busy .
DON CORLEONE: I 'm sure it 's the most generous gift today .
HAGEN: The Senator calledapologized fo not coming personally , but said you 'd understand . Also , some of the Judgesthey 've all sent gifts . And another call from Virgil Sollozzo . DON CORLEONE is not pleased .
DON CORLEONE: And with prison record .
HAGEN: Two terms ; one in Italy , one in the United States . He 's known to the Government as a top narcotics man . That could be a plus for us ; he could never get immunity to testify .
DON CORLEONE: When did he call ?
HAGEN: This morning .
DON CORLEONE: On a day like this . Consiglero , do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war , like the Tattaglias do now . Write that down before you forget it . The Turk will wait .
HAGEN: Should I bring him in .
DON CORLEONE: No . Let the people enjoy him . You see ? He is a good godson .
HAGEN: It 's been two years . He 's probably in trouble again .
KAY: I did n't know your family knew Johnny Fontane .
MICHAEL: Sure .
KAY: I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off .
MICHAEL: He 's my father 's godson ; he owes him his whole career .
DON CORLEONE: My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat .
JOHNNY: I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy . When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you were n't sore at me anymore , Godfather .
DON CORLEONE: Can I do something for you still ? You 're not too rich , or too famous that I ca n't help you ?
JOHNNY: I 'm not rich anymore , Godfather , andmy career , I 'm almost washed up
DON CORLEONE: Tell Santino to come in with us . He should hear some things .
HAGEN: Sonny ? Then he goes up .
LUCY: Sonnyeeeeeeee .
HAGEN: The old man wants you ; Johnny 's herehe 's got a problem .
DON CORLEONE: ACT LIKE A MAN ! By Christ in Heaven , is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood finocchio .
JOHNNY: He owns the studio . Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book , a best seller . And the main character is a guy just like me . I would n't even have to act , just be myself . The DON is silent , stern .
DON CORLEONE: You take care of your family ?
JOHNNY: Sure .
DON CORLEONE: You look terrible . I want you to eat well , to rest . And spend time with your family . And then , at the end of the month , this big shot will give you the part you want .
JOHNNY: It 's too late . All the contracts have been signed , they 're almost eady to shoot .
DON CORLEONE: I 'll make him an offer he ca n't efuse .
HAGEN: They 'll cut the cake in a few minutesleave right after that . Your new son-in-law , do we give him something important ?
DON CORLEONE: No , give him a living . But neve let him know the family 's business . What else , Tom ?
HAGEN: I 've called the hospital ; they 've notified Consiglere Genco 's family to come and wait . He wo n't last out the night . This saddens the DON . He sighs .
DON CORLEONE: Genco will wait for me . Santino , tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco . Tell Fredo to drive the big car , and ask Johnny to come with us .
SONNY: And Michael ?
DON CORLEONE: All my sons . Tom , I want you to go to California tonight . Make the arrangements . But do n't leave until I come back from the hospital and speak to you . Understood ?
HAGEN: Understood .
DON CORLEONE: Will your girl friend get back to the city all right ?
MICHAEL: Tom said he 'd take care of it .
DON CORLEONE: What was this for ?
MICHAEL: For bravery .
DON CORLEONE: And this ?
MICHAEL: For killing a man .
DON CORLEONE: What miracles you do for strangers .
MICHAEL: I fought for my country . It was my choice .
DON CORLEONE: And now , what do you choose to do ?
MICHAEL: I 'm going to finish school .
DON CORLEONE: Good . When you are finished , come and talk to me . I have hopes fo you .
GENCO: Godfather , Godfather , it 's you daughter 's wedding day , you can not efuse me . Cure me , you have the power .
DON CORLEONE: I have no such powerbut Genco , do n't fear death .
GENCO: It 's been arranged , then ?
DON CORLEONE: You blaspheme . Resign yourself .
GENCO: You need your old Consigliere . Who will replace me ? Stay with me Godfather . Help me meet death . If he sees you , he will be frightened and leave me in peace . You can say a word , pull a few strings , eh ? We 'll outwit that astard as we outwitted all those others . Godfather , do n't betray me .
DON CORLEONE: Luca , I am worried about this man Sollozzo . Find out what you can , through the Tattaglias . Let them elieve you could be tempted away from the Corleone Family , if the ight offer was made . Learn what he has under his fingernails
SONNY: It 's me , Sonny .
DON CORLEONE: Remember my new Consigliere , a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns .
WOLTZ: You should have told me your boss was Corleone , Tom , I had to check you out . I thought you were just some third rate hustler Johnny was unning in to bluff me . Florence , thirteenth century . Decorated the garden of a king .
HAGEN: Mr. Corleone is Johnny 's Godfather . That is very close , a very sacred eligious relationship .
WOLTZ: Okay , but just tell him this is one favor I ca n't give . But he should try me again on anything else .
HAGEN: He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first . Understood ?
WOLTZ: You smooth son of a bitch , let me lay it on the line for you , and your boss . Johnny Fontane neve gets that movie . I do n't care how many Dago , Guinea , wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork !
HAGEN: I 'm German-Irish .
WOLTZ: Okay my Kraut-Mick friend , Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I 'm going to run him out of the Movies . And I 'll tell you why . He ruined one of Woltz Brothers ' most valuable proteges . For five years I had this girl under training ; singing lessons ! Acting lessons ! Dancing lessons ! We spent hundreds of thousands of dollarsI was going to make her a star . I 'll be even more frank , just to show you that I 'm not a hard-hearted man , that it was n't all dollars and cents . That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I 've ever ad and I 've had them all over the world . Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she uns off . She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous . A MAN IN
SOLLOZZO: My business is heroin , I have poppy fields , laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily , ready to go into production . My importing methods are as safe as these things can be , about five per cent loss . The risk is nothing , the profits enormous .
DON CORLEONE: Why do you come to me ? Why do I deserve your generosity ?
SOLLOZZO: I need two million dollars in cashmore important , I need a friend who has people in high places ; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested , they would get only light sentences . Be my friend .
DON CORLEONE: What percentages for my family ?
SOLLOZZO: Thirty per cent . In the first yea your share would be four million dollars ; then it would go up .
DON CORLEONE: And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family ? SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN .
SOLLOZZO: My compliments . I 'll take care of them from my share .
DON CORLEONE: So . I receive 30 per cent just fo finance and legal protection . No worries about operations , is that what you tell me ?
SOLLOZZO: If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance , I congratulate you Don Corleone .
DON CORLEONE: I said I would see you because I 've heard you 're a serious man , to be treated with respect But I 'll say no to you . We feel this around the room .
SOLLOZZO: Are you worried about security fo your million ?
DON CORLEONE: No .
SOLLOZZO: The Tattaglias will guarantee you investment also . This startles SONNY ; he blurts out .
SONNY: The Tattaglia family guarantees ou investment ?
DON CORLEONE: Young people are greedy , and they have no manners . They speak when they should listen . But I have a sentimental weakness for my children , and I 've spoiled them , as you see . But Signor Sollozzo , my no is final .
HAGEN: It 's from Johnny . It was announced this morning . He 's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film .
DON CORLEONE: Send Johnny my congratulations .
KAY: We have something for your mother , for Sonny , we have the tie fo Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen
MICHAEL: And what do you want for Christmas ?
KAY: Just you . They kiss .
MICHAEL: As long as I tell him beforehand he wo n't object . He 'll be hurt , but he wo n't object .
KAY: What time do they expect us ?
MICHAEL: For dinner . Unless I call and tell them we 're still in New Hampshire .
KAY: Michael .
MICHAEL: Then we can have dinner , see a show , and spend one more night . He moves to the telephone .
KAY: Michael , what are you doing ?
MICHAEL: Shhh , you be the long distance operator . Here .
KAY: Hellothis is Long Distance . I have a call from New Hampshire . Mr. Michael Corleone . One moment please .
MICHAEL: Hello , Tom ? Michael . Yeah listen , we have n't left yet . I 'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning . There 's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas . Will he be home tomorrow night ?
HAGEN: Right .
DON CORLEONE: Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot ; I 'll be ready to go home in a few minutes .
FREDO: I 'll have to get it myself ; Paulie called in sick this morning .
DON CORLEONE: That 's the third time this month . I think maybe you 'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me . Tell Tom .
FREDO: Paulie 's a good kid . If he 's sick , he 's sick . I do n't mind getting the car .
OFFICE MANAGER: Buon Watale , Don Corleone .
DON CORLEONE: Merry Christmas . And he starts down the stairs .
SOLLOZZO: Do n't be frightened . I just want to talk to you .
HAGEN: I have n't got time .
SOLLOZZO: Get in the car . If I wanted to kill you you 'd be dead already . Trust me .
KAY: Would you like me better if I were a nun ?
MICHAEL: No .
KAY: Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman ?
MICHAEL: I 'm thinking about it .
KAY: Michael
MICHAEL: No , I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman .
MICHAEL: They do n't say if he 's dead or alive .
DON CORLEONE: Fredo , Fredo !
MAN: LucaI 'm Bruno Tattaglia .
LUCA: I know .
SOLLOZZO: Do you know who I am ? LUCA Nods .
LUCA: If the money is good enough .
SOLLOZZO: On the first shipment , I can guarantee you fifty thousand dollars .
SONNY: Yeah .
SANDRA: Oh God
SONNY: Honeydo n't worry . Nothing else is going to happen .
CLEMENZA: You heard about your father ?
SONNY: Yeah .
CLEMENZA: The word is out in the streets that he 's dead .
SONNY: Where the hell was Paulie , why was n't he with the Don ?
CLEMENZA: Paulie 's been a little sick all winterhe was home .
SONNY: How many times did he stay home the last couple of months ?
CLEMENZA: Maybe three , four times . I always asked Freddie if he wanted anothe odyguard , but he said no . Things have been so smooth the last ten years
SONNY: Go get Paulie , I do n't care how sick he is . Pick him up yourself , and bring him to my father 's house .
CLEMENZA: That 's all ? Do n't you want me to send some people over here ?
SONNY: No , just you and Paulie .
MAMA: Santino ? Have they killed him ?
SONNY: We do n't know yet , Ma .
MAMA: I 'll get dressed . In case we can see him
SONNY: TessioThis is Santino Corleone . I want fifty reliable men out here .
SOLLOZZO: I know you 're not in the muscle end of the familyso I do n't want you to be afraid . I want you to help the Corleones and I want you to help me .
HAGEN: Sonny will come after you with everything he 's got . SOLLOZZO rises , impatiently .
SOLLOZZO: That 's going to be his first eaction . You have to talk some sense into him . The Tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people . The other New York Families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war . He leans close to HAGEN .
HAGEN: Even Sonny wo n't be able to call off Luca Brasi .
SOLLOZZO: I 'll worry about Luca . You take care of Sonny and the other two kids .
HAGEN: I 'll tryIt 's what the Don would want us to do .
SOLLOZZO: Goodthen you can go I do n't like violence . I 'm a usinessman , and blood is a big expense . He opens the door ; they step out together .
MAN: Who 're you ?
MAN 2: It 's the Don 's kid ; take the car , I 'll bring him inside .
CLEMENZA: Your mother 's at the hospital with the old man He 's gon na pull through . MICHAEL nods his relief .
MICHAEL: Thanks . He moves to THERESA .
SONNY: Do n't worry , Theresa ; they just want to give Tom the proposition , then they 're going to turn him loose .
MICHAEL: How 's Mom ?
SONNY: Good . She 's been through it before . Me too . You were too young to know about it . You better wait outside ; there 're some things you should n't hear .
MICHAEL: I can help you out
SONNY: Oh no you ca n't , the old man 'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this .
MICHAEL: Jesus Christ , he 's my father , Sonny .
SONNY: Theresa . She understands , and leaves them alone .
MICHAEL: What ?
SONNY: One of them fingered the old man .
MICHAEL: Clemenza ? No , I do n't believe it .
SONNY: You 're right , kid , Clemenza is okay . It was Paulie .
MICHAEL: How can you be sure ?
SONNY: On the three days Paulie was sick this month , he got calls from a payphone across from the old man 's uilding . We got people in the phone company . Thank God it was Pauliewe 'll need Clemenza bad .
MICHAEL: Is it going to be all-out war , like last time ?
SONNY: Until the old man tells me different .
MICHAEL: Then wait , Sonny . Talk to Pop .
SONNY: Sollozzo is a dead man , I do n't care what it costs . I do n't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York . The Tattaglia family 's going to eat dirt . I do n't care if we all go down together .
MICHAEL: That 's not how Pop would have played it .
SONNY: I know I 'm not the man he was . But I 'll tell you this and he 'll tell you too . When it comes to real action , I can operate as good as anybody short range .
MICHAEL: All right , Sonny . All right .
SONNY: Christ , if I could only contact Luca .
MICHAEL: Is it like they say ? Is he that good ?
HAGEN: If I plead before the Supreme Court , I 'll never do better than I did tonight with that Turk .
SONNY: The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time . What about the hit list .
HAGEN: Too much , too far , too personal . The Don would consider this all purely a business dispute Get rid of Sollozzo , and everything falls in line . YOU do n't have to go after the Tattaglias . CLEMENZA nods .
SONNY: If Luca sold out we 're in real trouble .
HAGEN: Has anyone been able to get in touch with him ?
SONNY: No , and I 've been calling all night . Maybe he 's shacked up .
HAGEN: Luca never sleeps over with a broad . He always goes home when he 's through . Mike , keep ringing Luca 's number .
SONNY: Tom , you 're the Consigliere , what do we do if the old man dies ?
HAGEN: Without your father 's political contacts and personal influence , the Corleone family loses half its strength . Without your father , the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo , and the Tattaglias just to make sure there is n't a long destructive war . The old days are over , this is 1946 ; nobody wants bloodshed anymore . If your father diesmake the deal , Sonny .
SONNY: That 's easy to say ; it 's not you father .
HAGEN: I was as good a son to him as you or Mike .
SONNY: Oh Christ Tom , I did n't mean it that way .
HAGEN: We 're all tired
SONNY: OK , we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead . But Tom , I want you to stay inside the Mall . You too , Mike , no chances . Tessio , you hold your people in reserve , ut have them nosing around the city . The hospital is yours ; I want it tight , fool-proof , 24 hours a day . There is a timid knock on the door .
CLEMENZA: I tol ' you to stay put , Paulie
PAULIE: The guy at the gate 's outsidesays there 's a package
SONNY: Tessio , see what it is . TESSIO gets up , leaves .
PAULIE: You want me to hang around ?
SONNY: Yeah . Hang around .
PAULIE: Outside ?
CLEMENZA: Outside .
PAULIE: Sure . He closes the door .
SONNY: Clemenza . You take care of Paulie . I do n't ever want to see him again . Understood ?
CLEMENZA: Understood .
SONNY: Okay , now you can move your men into the Mall , replace Tessio 's people . Mike , tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza 's people and go to Luca 's apartment and wait fo him to show . That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he 's heard the news .
HAGEN: Maybe Mike should n't get mixed up in this so directly . You know the old man does n't want that .
SONNY: OK forget it , just stay on the phone .
CLEMENZA: A Sicilian message Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes .
BRUNO: Oh Christall over the floor .
SOLLOZZO: The Godfather is next .
LAMPONE: Nice .
CLEMENZA: Crazy Detroit delivered it with a wooden bumper . They 're going to send me the chrome bumpers in a couple months . I waited two years for this car to come with wooden umpers ! He scrubs and polishes with great affection .
LAMPONE: Sure .
CLEMENZA: .22 soft-nosed load . Accurate up to five feet .
PAULIE: Rocco , sit on the other side . A ig guy like you blocks my rearview mirror . CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE .
CLEMENZA: Goddamn Sonny . He 's running scared . He 's already thinking of going to the mattresses . We have to find a place on the West Side . Paulie , you know a good location ?
PAULIE: I 'll think about it .
CLEMENZA: Drive while you thinking ; I wan na get to the City this month ! The car pulls out .
PAULIE: Good for ten men
CLEMENZA: OK , go to Arthur Avenue ; I 'm suppose to call when I found somethin ' . The car pulls off .
PAULIE: You think we 'll go for that last place ?
CLEMENZA: Maybe , or you got ta know now .
PAULIE: Holy cow , I do n't got ta know nothing .
CLEMENZA: Paulie , pull over . I got ta take a leak .
MICHAEL: Hello . Kay ?
CLEMENZA: How come you do n't tell that nice girl you love herhere , learn something you may have to feed fifty guys some day . You start with olive oilfry some garlic , see . And then fry some sausageor meat alls if you likethen you throw in the tomatoes , the tomato pastesome basil ; and a little ed winethat 's my trick . SONNY peeks into the kitchen ; sees CLEMENZA .
SONNY: You take care of Paulie ?
CLEMENZA: You wo n't see Paulie anymore . He 's sick for good this winter . MICHAEL starts to leave .
SONNY: Where are you going ?
MICHAEL: To the city .
SONNY: Send some bodyguards .
MICHAEL: I do n't need them , Sonny . I 'm just going to see Pop in the hospital . Also , I got other things .
CLEMENZA: Sollozzo knows Mike 's a civilian .
SONNY: OK , but be careful .
MICHAEL: Visiting hour ends at eight thirty . I 'll just sit with him ; I want to show respect .
KAY: Can I go to the hospital with you ?
MICHAEL: I do n't think so . You do n't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News .
KAY: My parents do n't read the Daily News . All right , if you think I should n't . I ca n't believe the things the papers are printing . I 'm sure most of it 's not true .
MICHAEL: I do n't think so either . I better go .
KAY: When will I see you again ?
MICHAEL: I want you to go back to New Hampshirethink things over . He leans over her ; kisses her .
KAY: When will I see you again ?
MICHAEL: Goodbye . Quietly , he moves out the door .
KAY: Goodbye .
MICHAEL: Hello ? Hello ?
NURSE: You 're not supposed to be here now . MICHAEL calms himself , and moves to her .
MICHAEL: I 'm Michael Corleonethis is my father . What happened to the detectives who were guarding him ?
NURSE: Oh your father just had too many visitors . It interfered with the hospital service . The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago . But do n't worry . I look in on him .
MICHAEL: You just stand here one minute
NURSE: You can not stay hereI 'm sorry .
MICHAEL: You and I are going to move my father right nowto another room on another floorCan you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out ?
NURSE: Absolutely not ! We have to get permission from the Doctor .
MICHAEL: You 've read about my father in the papers . You 've seen that no one 's here to guard him . Now I 've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him . Believe me and help me .
NURSE: We do n't have to disconnect them , we can wheel the stand with the bed .
MICHAEL: Hurry , into there .
ENZO: Michaeldo you remember me , Enzo , the baker 's helper to Nazorine , now his son-in-law .
MICHAEL: Enzo , get out of here . There 's going to be trouble . A look of fear sweeps through ENZO 's face .
ENZO: If therewill be troubleI stay with you , to help . I owe it to the Godfather .
MICHAEL: Go outside ; stand in frontI 'll e out in a minute .
NURSE: He 's awake .
MICHAEL: PopPop , it 's me Michael . Shhhh , do n't try to speak . There are men who are coming to try to kill you . But I 'm with youI 'm with you now
MCCLUSKEY: I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up . Who the hell are you and what are you doing here ? ANOTHER COP standing nearby
COP: He 's clean , Captain . MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely .
MICHAEL: What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father ?
MCCLUSKEY: You punk-hood . Who the hell are you to tell me my business . I pulled them off . I do n't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other . I would n't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off . Now get the hell out of here ; get off this street you punk , and stay away from this hospital . MICHAEL stands quiet .
MICHAEL: I 'll stay until you put guards around my father 's room .
MCCLUSKEY: Phil , lock this punk up .
A DETECTIVE: The Kid 's clean , CaptainHe 's a war hero , and he 's never been mixed up in the rackets
MCCLUSKEY: Goddam it , I said lock him up . Put the cuffs on him .
MICHAEL: How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up , Captain ?
CLEMENZA: How come all the new men ?
TESSIO: We 'll need them now . After the hospital incident , Sonny got mad . We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock this morning .
SONNY: I 've got a hundred button men on the streets twenty-four hours a day . If Sollozzo shows one hair on his ass he 's dead .
MICHAEL: Cut it out .
SONNY: The Turk wants to talk ! The nerve of that son of a bitch ! After he craps out last night he wants a meet .
HAGEN: Was there a definite proposal ?
SONNY: Sure , he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition . The promise is the deal will be so good we ca n't refuse .
HAGEN: What about that Tattaglias ? What will they do about Bruno ?
SONNY: Part of the deal Bruno cancels out what they did to my father .
HAGEN: We should hear what they have to say .
SONNY: No , no Consiglere . Not this time . No more meetings , no more discussions , no more Sollozzo tricks . Give them one message I WANT SOLLOZZO . If not , it 's all out war . We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street .
HAGEN: The other families wo n't sit still for all out war .
SONNY: Then THEY hand me Sollozzo .
HAGEN: Come ON Sonny , your father would n't want to hear this . This is not a personal thing , this is Business .
SONNY: And when they shot me father
HAGEN: Yes , even the shooting of you father was business , not personal
SONNY: No no , no more advice on how to patch it up Tom . You just help me win . Understood ? HAGEN bows his head ; he is deeply concerned .
HAGEN: I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike 's jaw . He 's definitely on Sollozzo 's payroll , and for big money . McCluskey 's agreed to be the Turk 's odyguard . What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this , he 's invulnerable . Nobody has eve gunned down a New York Police Captain . Never . It would be disastrous . All the five families would come after you Sonny ; the Corleone family would be outcasts ; even the old man 's political protection would run for cover . So justtake that into consideration .
SONNY: McCluskey ca n't stay with the Turk forever . We 'll wait .
MICHAEL: We ca n't wait . No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal , he 's figuring out how to kill Pop . You have to get Sollozzo now .
SONNY: The kid 's right .
HAGEN: What about McCluskey ?
MICHAEL: Let 's say now that we have to kill McCluskey . We 'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later .
SONNY: Go on Mike .
MICHAEL: They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo . Set up the meeting for two days from now . Sonny , get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held . Insist it has to be a public place a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour . So I 'll feel safe . They 'll check me when I meet them so I wo n't be able to carry a weapon ; but Clemenza , figure out a way to have one planted there fo me . Then I 'll kill them both .
SONNY: You ? You , the high-class college kid . You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business . Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face . You 're taking it personal , it 's just business and he 's taking it personal .
MICHAEL: Sonny , it 's all personal , and I learned it from him , the old man , the Godfather . He took my joining the Marines personal . I take Sollozzo trying to kill my fathe personal , and you know I 'll kill them Sonny .
CLEMENZA: Just let your hand drop to you side , and let the gun slip out . Everybody will still think you got it . They 'll be starin ' at you face , see ? Then walk out of the place real fast , but do n't run . Do n't look anybody directly in the eye , but do n't look away from them neither . Hey , they 'll be scared stiff o you , believe me . Nobody 's gon na bother with you . Do n't worry about nothing ; you 'd be surprised how good these things go . O.K. , put your hat on , let 's see how you look . Helps with identification . They put the hat on ; CLEMENZA adjusts it .
MICHAEL: How bad will it be ?
CLEMENZA: Probably all the other families will line up against us . But , it 's alright . These things have to happen once every ten years o sogets rid of the bad blood . You got ta stop 'em at the beginning . Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich , they shoulda never let him get away with that , they were just asking for big trouble
MICHAEL: Why do n't you stop living like a um and get this place cleaned up .
SONNY: What are you , inspecting the arracks ? You ready ? Did Clemenza tell you e sure to drop the gun right away ?
MICHAEL: A million times .
SONNY: Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square , under the big Camels sign .
HAGEN: We do n't let Mike go until we have the hostage , Sonny .
CLEMENZA: It 's okaythe hostage is outside playing pinochle with three of my men . The phone rings in the DON 's office .
SONNY: That could be a Tattaglia informe with the meeting place .
HAGEN: No . Our informer in McCluskey 's precinct . Tonight at 8 00 he signed out for Louis ' Restaurant in the Bronx . Anyone know it .
TESSIO: Sure , I do . It 's perfect for us . A small family place with big ooths where people can talk in private . Good food . Everybody minds their business . Perfect . This is the entrance , Mike . When you finish just walk out and turn left , then turn the corner . Clemenza , you got ta work fast to plant the gun . They got an old- fashioned toilet with a space etween the water container and the wall . We can tape the gun behind there .
CLEMENZA: Mike , they 're gon na frisk you in the car . You 'll be clean so they wo n't worry 'bout nothing . In the estaurant , wait and talk a while , and then ask permission to go . See ? Then when you come out , do n't waste time ; do n't sit downyou come out lasting . And do n't take chances . In the head , two shots apiece . And out as fast as your legs can move .
SONNY: I want somebody very good , very safe to plant that gun . I do n't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand .
CLEMENZA: The gun will be there .
SONNY: You 're on , kidI 'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left . And I 'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right .
CLEMENZA: We got ta move
MICHAEL: O.K . How long do you think before I can come back ?
SONNY: Probably a year
HAGEN: Jesus , I do n't know
SONNY: Can you do it Mike ? MICHAEL moves out .
DRIVER: Get in , Mike . He does , the car drives off .
SOLLOZZO: I 'm glad you came , Mike . I hope we can straighten everything out . All this is terrible , it 's not the way I wanted things to happen at all . It should never have happened .
MICHAEL: I want to settle things tonight . I want my father left alone .
SOLLOZZO: He wo n't be ; I swear to you be my children he wo n't be . Just keep an open mind when we talk . I hope you 're not a hothead like you other , Sonny . It 's impossible to talk business with him . McCLUSKEY grunts .
MCCLUSKEY: He 's a good kid . He 's all right . Turn around , up on your knees , facing me . He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk .
MICHAEL: We 're going to New Jersey ?
SOLLOZZO: Maybe . MICHAEL closes his eyes .
MCCLUSKEY: Is the Italian food good here ?
SOLLOZZO: Try the veal ; it 's the finest in New York .
MCCLUSKEY: Sure , you two go right ahead ; I 'll concentrate on my veal and my spaghetti .
MICHAEL: Most importantI want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father 's life .
SOLLOZZO: What guarantees can I give you ? I am the hunted one . I 've missed my chance . You think too highly of me , my friendI am not so cleverall I want if a truce
MICHAEL: Is it all right if I go to the athroom ?
MCCLUSKEY: I frisked him ; I 've frisked thousands of young punks ; he 's clean .
SOLLOZZO: Do n't take too long .
MICHAEL: Now I can talk . I feel much better .
MAN: Nice Augienice .
DRIVER: Pick up your sister ?
SONNY: Yeah .
CONNIE'S VOICE: Who is it ?
SONNY: It 's me , Sonny .
CONNIE: It was my fault ! I started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me . He did n't even try to hit me hard Sonny , I walked into it .
SONNY: I 'm goin ' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you . He starts to leave .
CONNIE: Oh Sonny , please do n't do anything . Please do n't . He stops , and then laughs good naturedly .
SONNY: Hey . Con . What 'm I goin ' to do ? Make your kid a orphan before he 's orn .
HAGEN: Kay , we were n't expecting you . You should call
KAY: I 've tried calling and writing . I want to reach Michael .
HAGEN: Nobody knows where he is . We know he 's all right , but that 's all .
KAY: What was that ?
HAGEN: An accident . No one was hurt .
KAY: Listen Tom , I let my cab go ; can I come in to call another one ?
HAGEN: SureI 'm sorry .
KAY: Will you give this to him .
HAGEN: If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it , they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts . Just wait Kay , he 'll contact you .
MAMA: You 're Mikey 's little girl .
KAY: Will you give this letter to Michael .
HAGEN: Mama , no .
MAMA: You tell me what to do ? Even he do n't tell me what to do .
KAY: Why did they blame Michael ?
MAMA: You listen to me , you go home to your family , and you find a good young man and get married . Forget about Mikey ; he 's no good for you , anymore .
CONNIE: What 's the matter , Carlo ?
CARLO: Shut up .
HAGEN: since McCluskey 's killing , the police have cracked down on most of our operationson the othe families too . There 's been a lot of bad blood . The OLD MAN glances at SONNY .
SONNY: Pop , they hit us and we hit them ack .
HAGEN: We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapersabout McCluskey 's eing tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Racketsthings are starting to loosen up . The OLD MAN nods .
SONNY: Freddie 's gon na go to Las Vegasunder the protection of Don Francesco of L.A . I want him to est
FREDO: I 'm goin ' to learn the casino usiness .
HAGEN: Michael It was Michael who killed Sollozzo .
SONNY: We 'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks . I want to get things going good before he gets better . What 's the matte with you ?
HAGEN: You start operating , the five families will start their raids again . We 're at a stalemate Sonny , your war is costing us a lot of money .
SONNY: No more stalemate Tom , we got the soldiers , we 'll match them gun fo gun if that 's how they want it . They know me for what I am , Tom and they 're scared of me .
HAGEN: Yes . That 's true , you 're getting a hell of a reputation .
SONNY: Well it 's war ! We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere , a Sicilian . Pop had Genco , who do I have ? Hey Tom , heyhey . It 's Sunday , we 're gon na have dinner . Do n't be sore .
CONNIE: Who is this ?
CARLO: What was that ?
CONNIE: Your girl friend . She says she ca n't make it tonight . You lousy astard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number . I 'll kill you , you bastard !
CARLO: You 're crazy . She was kidding around ; I do n't know , some nut .
CONNIE: You 're staying home . You 're not going out .
CARLO: OK , OK. You gon na make me something to eat at least ?
CONNIE: The food is on the table .
CARLO: I 'm not hungry yet .
CONNIE: Eat it , it 's on the table .
CARLO: Ba Fa Goulle .
CONNIE: BA FA GOULE YOU !
CARLO: You filthy guinea spoiled brat . Clean it up or I 'll kick your head in .
CONNIE: Like hell I will .
CARLO: Clean it up !
CONNIE: The baby ! The baby !
CARLO: You 're fat as a pig .
CONNIE: Mamamama , it 's Connie . Mama , I ca n't talk any louder . No , I do n't want to talk to Sonny .
SONNY: Yeah Connie .
HAGEN: Go after him .
BONASERA: Yes , I understand . I 'm listening .
MRS. BONASERA: Amerigo !
BONASERA: They could make me an accomplice to their murder . They could send me to jail !
DON CORLEONE: Well my friend , are you ready to do me this service ?
BONASERA: What do you wish me to do ?
DON CORLEONE: I want you to use all your powers , all your skill , as you love me . I do not want his mother to see him as he is . He draws down the gray blanket .
HAGEN: OK. Go to Clemenza 's house and tell him to come here right away . He 'll tell you what to do .
DON CORLEONE: Give me a drop of anisette .
HAGEN: I did n't tell Mama anything . I was about to come up and wake you and tell you . Just now .
DON CORLEONE: But you needed a drink first .
HAGEN: Yes .
DON CORLEONE: Now you 've had your drink . Pause .
HAGEN: They shot Sonny on the Causeway . He 's dead .
DON CORLEONE: I want no inquiries made . No acts of vengeance . Consigliere , arrange a meeting with the heads of the five familiesthis war stops now .
HAGEN: This is Tom Hagen ; I 'm calling fo Don Corleone , at his request .
DON CORLEONE: Ah well , let 's get down to business . We are all honorable men here , we do n't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers . How did things ever go so far ? Well , no matter . A lot of foolishness has come to pass . It was so unfortunate , so unnecessary .
BARZINI: Don Corleone is too modest . He had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them . His refusal is not the act of a friend . He takes the bread out of the mouths of our families . Times have changed , it 's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way . If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York , then he must share them or let others use them . Certainly he can present a bill for such services , we 're not Communists , after all . But he has to let us draw wate from the well . It 's that simple .
DON CORLEONE: My friends , I did n't refuse out of malice . You all know me . When have I ever refused an accommodation ? But why , this time ? Because I think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come . It 's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the Church and the Government . But drugs ? No . Even policemen , who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs . ButI am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary .
DON ZALUCHI: I do n't believe in drugs . Fo years I paid my people extra so they would n't do that kind of usiness $ 200 a week . But it did n't matter . Somebody comes to them and says , `` I have powders , if you put up three , four thousand dollar investment , we can make fifty thousand distributing . '' Who can resist such a profit ? There 's no way to control it , as a usinessto keep it respectable . I do n't want it near schools ! I do n't want it sold to children . That is an infamita . In my city I would try to keep the traffic in the dark people , the colored . They are the best customers , the least troublesome , and they are animals anyway . They have no respect for their wives o their families or themselves . Let them lose their souls with drugs . But something has to be done , we ca n't have everybody running around doing just what they please , like a unch of anarchists .
BARZINI: Then , are we agreed ; the traffic in drugs will be permitted , but controlled ; and Don Corleone agrees to give it protection in the East . DON CORLEONE nods .
TATTAGLIA: I agree to everything here , I 'm willing to forget my own misfortune . But I must hear strict assurance from Corleone . When time goes by and his position becomes stronger , will he attempt any individual vengeance ?
DON CORLEONE: I forego my vengeance for my dead son , for the common good . But I have selfish reasons . My youngest son had to flee , accused of Sollozzo 's murder , and I must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety , cleared of all those false charges . That is my affair , and I will make those arrangements . But I am a superstitious manand so if some unlucky accident should efall my youngest son , if some police officer should accidentally shoot him , or if he should hang himself in his cell , or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning , then I will blame some of the people here . That , I could neve forgive , butaside from that , let me swear by the souls of my Grandchildren that I will never be the one to break the peace we have made .
HAGEN: When I meet with Tattaglia 's people ; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean ?
DON CORLEONE: Mention it , do n't insist . Barzini is a man who will know that without eing told .
HAGEN: You mean Tattaglia .
DON CORLEONE: Barzini .
HAGEN: He was the one behind Sollozzo ?
DON CORLEONE: Tattaglia is a pimp . He could never have outfought Santino . But I was n't sure until this day . No , it was Barzini all along .
MICHAEL: Don Tommassino .
DON TOMMASSINO: Michael , why must you do this . We have been lucky so far , all these months you 've been here we 've kept your name a secret . It is from love for your father that I 've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa .
MICHAEL: Calo and Fabrizzio are with me ; nothing will happen .
DON TOMMASSINO: You must understand that you Father 's enemies have friends in Palermo .
MICHAEL: I know .
DON TOMMASSINO: Where are you going ?
MICHAEL: Corleone .
DON TOMMASSINO: There is nothing there . Not anymore .
MICHAEL: I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street ; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old .
DON TOMMASSINO: Long ago . Now there is nothing the men killed each other in family vendettasthe others escaped to America .
MICHAEL: Don TommassinoI should see this place .
DON TOMMASSINO: That is your birthrightbut Michael , use this car .
MICHAEL: NoI would like to walk to Corleone .
DON TOMMASSINO: Be careful Michael , do n't let them know your name .
FABRIZZIO: You tell us about America .
MICHAEL: How do you know I come from America ?
FABRIZZIO: We hear . We were told you were a Pezzonovantabig shot .
MICHAEL: Only the son of a Pezzonovanta .
FABRIZZIO: Hey America ! Is she as rich as they say ?
MICHAEL: Yes .
FABRIZZIO: Take me to America ! You need a good lupara in America ? You take me , I 'll be the best man you got . `` Oh say , can you seeeeBy da star early light '' MICHAEL laughs .
CALO: Corleone .
FABRIZZIO: Hey , beautiful girls !
MICHAEL: Shhhhh . He settles down to watch .
FABRIZZIO: Jesus Christ , take my soul . I 'm dying . Quickly , she turns , and runs away .
CALO: Easy man .
MICHAEL: What are you talking about ?
FABRIZZIO: You ca n't hide it when you 're hit y the thunderbolt .
VITELLI: You had better bring a few bottles home with you , my friend ; you 'll need help sleeping tonight .
FABRIZZIO: This one could seduce the devil . A ody ! and eyes as big and black as olives .
VITELLI: I know about what you mean !
FABRIZZIO: This was a beauty . Right , Calo ?
VITELLI: Beautiful all over , eh ?
FABRIZZIO: And hair . Black and curly , like a doll . And such a mouth . VITELLI does not laugh quite so much .
VITELLI: Yes , we have beautiful girls here ut virtuous . VITELLI is no longer drinking with them .
MICHAEL: She wore a red dress , and a red ibbon in her hair . She looks more Greek than Italian . Do you know a eauty like that ?
VITELLI: No .
FABRIZZIO: God in Heaven , I think I understand
CALO: Come quickly .
MICHAEL: Innkeeper . More wine !
FABRIZZIO: The old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up .
MICHAEL: Tell him to come to me .
VITELLI: Who are you and what do you want from my daughter ?
MICHAEL: I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country . My name is Michael . You can inform the police and make your fortune ut then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband . In any case , I want to meet you daughter . With your permission and under the supervision of you family . With all decorum . With all respect . I am an honorable man .
VITELLI: Are you a friend of the friends ?
MICHAEL: When the proper time comes , I 'll tell you everything that a wife 's father should know .
FABRIZZIO: It 's the real Thunderbolt , then .
VITELLI: Come Sunday morning My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill , above the village .
MICHAEL: Your daughter 's name ?
VITELLI: Appolonia .
APPOLONIA: Grazia .
MICHAEL: It 's safer to teach you English .
APPOLONIA: Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , FridaySee , I learned it . Now teach me to drive !
MICHAEL: Ciao , Don Tommassino . APPOLONIA kisses him .
DON TOMMASSINO: The younger men have no respect . Things are changing ; I do n't know what will happen . Michael , because of the wedding , people now know your name .
MICHAEL: Is that why there are more men on the walls ?
DON TOMMASSINO: Even so , I do n't think it is safe here anymore . I 've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse . You must go right away .
MICHAEL: What is it ?
DON TOMMASSINO: Bad news from America . You other , Santino . He has been killed .
MICHAEL: Get the car . I 'll be leaving in ten minutes . Where 's Calo ?
FABRIZZIO: Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen . Is your wife coming with you ?
MICHAEL: No , she 's going home to her family . She 'll join me in a few weeks
CALO: Should I get your bag ?
MICHAEL: No , I 'll get it . Where 's Appolonia ?
CALO: She is sitting in the driver 's seat of the car , dying to step on the gas . She 'll be a real American woman before she gets to America . MICHAEL smiles .
MICHAEL: Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car .
APPOLONIA: I 'll drive to you . He smiles affectionately .
MICHAEL: No . No !
DON CORLEONE: Be my son
MICHAEL: No .
DON CORLEONE: I understand , Michael . But you must make a family , you know .
MICHAEL: I want children , I want a family . But I do n't know when .
DON CORLEONE: Accept what 's happened , Michael .
MICHAEL: I could accept everything that 's happened ; I could accept it , but that I never had a choice . From the time I was born , you had laid this all out for me .
DON CORLEONE: No , I wanted other things for you .
MICHAEL: You wanted me to be your son .
DON CORLEONE: Yes , but sons who would be professors , scientists , musiciansand grandchildren who could be , who knows , a Governor , a President even , nothing 's impossible here in America .
MICHAEL: Then why have I become a man like you ?
DON CORLEONE: You are like me , we refuse to be fools , to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men . I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over . That was my misfortune . That was you misfortune . I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was . I had no choice .
MICHAEL: A man has to choose what he will be . I believe that .
DON CORLEONE: What else do you believe in ? MICHAEL does n't answer .
MICHAEL: Why did n't Moe Green meet us at the airport ?
FREDO: He had business at the hotel , but he 'll drop in for dinner .
MICHAEL: You look good , too . They enter the suite .
FREDO: Nice , eh ?
MICHAEL: No .
FREDO: Mike ! The party starting !
MICHAEL: Come here a minute , Fredo .
FREDO: That 's for you to find out .
MICHAEL: Give them some money and send them home .
FREDO: Mike !
MICHAEL: Get rid of them
FREDO: Mike , you sure about Moe selling . He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business .
MICHAEL: I 'll make him an offer he ca n't efuse . MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY .
JOHNNY: Sure , I 'll do anything for my Godfather . You know that , Mike .
MOE: Mike , good to see you . Got everything you want ?
MICHAEL: Thanks .
MOE: The chef cooked for you special ; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good ! Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house .
MICHAEL: Is my credit good enough to buy you out ? MOE laughs .
MOE: Buy me out ?
MICHAEL: The hotel , the casino . The Corleone family wants to buy you out .
MOE: The Corleone family wants to buy me out . I buy you out . You do n't buy me out .
MICHAEL: Your casino loses money . Maybe we can do better .
MOE: You think I scam ?
MICHAEL: You 're unlucky .
MOE: You goddamn dagos . I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you 're having a bad time , and then you try to push me out .
MICHAEL: You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled you casino . You and the Corleone family are evened out . This is fo usiness ; name your price .
MOE: The Corleone family do n't have that kind of muscle anymore . The Godfather is sick . You 're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families , and you think you can find easier pickings here . I 've talked to Barzini ; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel !
MICHAEL: Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public ?
FREDO: Ah Mike , that was nothing . Moe did n't mean anything . He flies off the handle sometimes ; but me and him are good friends . Right , Moe ?
MOE: Yeah sure . Sometimes I got ta kick asses to make this place run right . Freddie and I had a little argument and I had to straighten him out .
MICHAEL: You straightened my brother out ?
MOE: Hell , he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time . Players could n't get a drink .
MICHAEL: I have to go back to New York tomorrow . Think of your price .
MOE: You son of a bitch , you think you can brush me off like that ? I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders .
FREDO: Tom , you 're the Consigliere ; you can talk to the Don and advise him .
MICHAEL: The Don has semi-retired . I 'm unning the Family business now . So anything you have to say , say it to me .
KAY: Oh Michael .
MICHAEL: We 'll go to the show tomorrow nightwe can change the tickets .
KAY: Do n't you want dinner first ?
MICHAEL: No , you eatdo n't wait up for me .
KAY: Wake me up when you come to bed ?
MICHAEL: Let HER ask .
KAY: She 's afraid to . Michael
MICHAEL: I 'm busy .
KAY: Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy .
MICHAEL: Let me think about it , O.K . ?
TESSIO: I 'm not asking you for help , Mike . Just take off the handcuffs .
CLEMENZA: You said there would come a day when Tessio and me could form ou own Families . Only with you enediction , of course . I ask permission
DON CORLEONE: My son is head of the Family now . If you have his permission , you have my good will .
MICHAEL: In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own . Carlo , I 'm counting on you to make the move to Nevada ; you 'll be my right-hand man out there . Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliere .
CLEMENZA: Then in a six month time we 're on our own ; is that it ?
MICHAEL: Maybe less
TESSIO: Let us fill up our Regimes .
MICHAEL: No . I want things very calm fo another six months .
TESSIO: Forgive me , Godfather , let ou years of friendship be my excuse . How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up ? The two go hand in hand . And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us .
CLEMENZA: And I do n't like Barzini . I say the Corleone Family has to move from strength , not weakness . We should build our Regimes and take ack our lost territories in Staten Island , at least .
DON CORLEONE: Do you have faith in my judgement ?
CLEMENZA: Yes , Godfather
DON CORLEONE: Then do what Michael says
MICHAEL: All I can say is that things are eing resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets . Understood ? There are uneasy looks all around .
CARLO: Understood . I just wish I was doing more to help out .
MICHAEL: I 'll come to you when I need you .
HAGEN: Mike , why are you cutting me out of the action ?
MICHAEL: Tom , we 're going to be legitimate all the way , and you 're the legal man . What could be more important than that .
HAGEN: I 'm not talking about that . I 'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime . Why does Neri eport directly to you , rather than through me or a caporegime ?
DON CORLEONE: I told you that it would n't escape his eye .
MICHAEL: How did you find out ?
HAGEN: Bookkeepers know everything . Rocco 's men are all a little too good for the jobs they 're supposed to be doing . They get a little more money than the job 's worth . Lampone 's a good man ; he 's operating perfectly .
MICHAEL: Not so perfectly if you noticed .
HAGEN: Mike , why am I out ?
MICHAEL: You 're not a wartime Consigliere . Things may get tough with the move we 're trying .
HAGEN: OK , but then I agree with Tessio . You 're going about it all wrong ; you 're making the move out of weakness Barzini 's a wolf , and if he tears you apart , the othe families wo n't come running to help the Corleones
DON CORLEONE: Tom , I never thought you were a bad Consigliere , I thought Santino a ad Don , rest in peace . He had a good heart but he was n't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune . Michael has all my confidence , as you do . For reasons which you ca n't know , you must have no part in what will happen .
HAGEN: Maybe I can help .
MICHAEL: You 're out , Tom .
DON CORLEONE: I see you have your Luca Brasi .
MICHAEL: I 'll need him .
DON CORLEONE: There are men in this world who demand to be killed . They argue in gambling games ; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender . These people wander through the streets calling out `` Kill me , kill me . '' Luca Brasi was like that . And since he was n't scared of death , and in fact , looked fo itI made him my weapon . Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him . I think you have done the same with this man .
MICHAEL: How ?
DON CORLEONE: He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust . That person will arrange a meeting , guarantee your safety He rises , and looks at Michael
MICHAEL: Yes .
DON CORLEONE: Good .
MICHAEL: I 've always respected you A long silence . The DON smiles at MICHAEL .
DON CORLEONE: And Iyou .
KAY: How is your husband feeling ?
MAMA: He 's not the same since they shot him . He lets Michael do all the work . He just plays the fool with his garden , his peppers , his tomatoes , as if he was some peasant still . But men are like that She stops toward the Church .
GIRL: Do you remember me ?
TESSIO: No
GIRL: We danced together at Connie 's wedding .
TESSIO: Mike , could I have a minute ?
MICHAEL: He talked to you ?
TESSIO: I can arrange security . MICHAEL looks at him .
MICHAEL: Christ , Tom ; I needed more time with him . I really needed him .
HAGEN: Did he give you his politicians ?
MICHAEL: Not allI needed another fou months and I would have had them all . I guess you 've figured it all out ?
HAGEN: How will they come at you ?
MICHAEL: I know now . I 'll make them call me Don .
HAGEN: Have you agreed on a meeting ?
MICHAEL: A week from tonight . In Brooklyn on Tessio 's ground , where I 'll be safe . HAGEN looks at him ; understands .
PRIEST: Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless ? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world ?
MICHAEL: Yes , I promise .
NERI: OK , wise guy , you wan na summons , o you wan na move ?
DRIVER: You better check with your precinct .
NERI: Move it !
PRIEST: Ephethabe openedSo you may perceive the fragrance of God 's sweetness .
MICHAEL: I do renounce him .
PRIEST: And all his works ?
MICHAEL: I do renounce them .
PRIEST: Do you wish to be baptized ?
MICHAEL: I do wish to be baptized .
PRIEST: I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi .
CONNIE: Kiss your Godfather .
MICHAEL: Carlowe 've had a change in the plans . Mama , Connie , Kay and the kids will have to take the trip out to Vegas without us .
CONNIE: Oh Mike , it 's our first vacation together .
CARLO: Jesus , ConnieSure , Mike
MICHAEL: Go back to your house and wait fo me He kisses KAY .
HAGEN: You 'd better make your call to Barzini ; Michael 's ready .
TESSIO: We 're on our way to Brooklyn . He hangs up and smiles .
HAGEN: I 'm sure he will .
BUTTON MAN: The boss says he 'll come in a separate car . He says for you two to go on ahead .
TESSIO: Hell , he ca n't do that . It screws up all my arrangements . THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him .
HAGEN: I ca n't go with you either , Tessio .
TESSIO: Tell Mike it was businessI always liked him .
HAGEN: He understands that . TESSIO looks at the men , and then pauses .
TESSIO: Tom , can you get me off the hook ? For old times ' sake ?
HAGEN: I ca n't .
CARLO: Godfather !
MICHAEL: You have to answer for Santino .
CARLO: I swear I 'm innocent . I swear on the head of my children , I 'm innocent . Mike , do n't do this to me , please Mike , do n't do this to me !
MICHAEL: Barzini is dead . So is Philip Tattaglia , so are Strachi , Cuneo and Moe GreeneI want to square all the family accounts tonight . So do n't tell me you 're innocent ; admit what you did .
CARLO: Barzini .
MICHAEL: Good , good . Leave now ; there 's a car waiting to take you to the airport .
NERI: You know I would never question anything you say .
MICHAEL: Speak your mind .
NERI: I 'll do this for you ; you know I should .
MICHAEL: No . This I have to do .
MAN: In the back . Hey Frank , someone wants you .
CONNIE: Michael !
KAY: Connie
CONNIE: You lousy bastard ; you killed my husband
KAY: Connie
CONNIE: You waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him , you killed him ! You lamed him about Sonny , you always did , everybody did . But you neve thought about me , never gave a damn about me . What am I going to do now , what am I going to do .
KAY: Connie , how could you say such things ?
CONNIE: Why do you think he kept Carlo on the Mall ? All the time he knew he was going to kill my husband . But he did n't dare while my father was alive . And then he stood Godfathe to our child . That coldhearted astard . And do you know how many men he had killed with Carlo ? Just read the papers . That 's your husband .
MICHAEL: Get her home and get a doctor .
KAY: Michael , it 's not true . Please tell me .
MICHAEL: Do n't ask me .
KAY: Tell me !
MICHAEL: All right , this one time I 'll let you ask about my affairs , one last time .
KAY: Is it true ?
MICHAEL: No .
KAY: We both need a drink .

DON FRANCESCO: I 'm not afraid of his words .
WIDOW: He is weak .
DON FRANCESCO: He will grow strong .
WIDOW: The child can not harm you .
DON FRANCESCO: He will be a man , and then he will come for revenge .

PENTANGELI: Forget it
FREDO: Who 's that ? Pentangeli ? Frankie & quot ; Five-Angels & quot ; thought you were never coming West .
PENTANGELI: Got ta check up on my boys . Hey , what 's with the food ? Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver . 'Canapes , ' he says . I say , 'Can a peas , my ass , that 's a ritz cracke with chopped liver . ' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I 'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners !
FREDO: Gee , Frankie , it 's good to see you . Reminds me of old times .
PENTANGELI: You remember Willy Cicci , do n't you , Freddie ? We was all togethe with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn beforeuh
FREDO: We were all upset about that .
PENTANGELI: That 's what I 'm here to talk to your brother about . What 's with him , I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown ' ?
FREDO: C'mon , I see what I can do .
SANDRA: Michael , this is Gardner Shaw . Francesca and he have been seeing each other for six months now . Gardner , this is Francie 's Uncle Michael .
GARDNER: I 've heard a lot about you , Mr. Corleone .
SANDRA: They would like to set an engagement date , and
MICHAEL: Let them speak for themselves .
FRANCESCA: We love each other , Uncle Michael . And , we want to be married . I came to ask for your blessing .
NERI: Not now , Freddie
FREDO: Tell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels ' is here .
NERI: Not now
MICHAEL: Francesca is my oldest brother 's daughter . He died many years ago , and ever since I 've felt much more of a father than an uncle . I love her very much . I 'm pleased and impressed that you had the thought to come to me before going on with your plans . It shows me that you 're a considerate man , and will e good to her . What are you studying in college ?
GARDNER: My major is Fine Arts , sir .
MICHAEL: How will Fine Arts support your new wife ?
GARDNER: It 's embarrassing to say , sir , but I 'm a major stockholder in the family corporation .
MICHAEL: Never be embarrassed by your wealth . This recent contempt for money is still another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it . Of course I give you my blessing . Let 's set the wedding soonit will be my pleasure to give the ide away . They all smile , and rise .
FRANCESCA: Thank you , Uncle Michael .
MICHAEL: Make her dowry impressive . He comes from a family who still thinks an Italian bride goes arefoot .
FRANCESCA: Uncle Michael is the greatest man ever ! VIEW on Kay - happy for her niece .
MICHAEL: It 's him . Fabrizzio . Revenge is a dish that tastes best when it 's cold .
NERI: How do you want me to handle it ?
MICHAEL: Later . Tom ?
HAGEN: I 've cleared it through the Senator 's chief aide , a man named Turnbull . Turnbull 's a heavy gambler , and into us for over a hundred grand , so I figure his information is reliable .
MICHAEL: Two-thirty . That gives me time to see my boy .
HAGEN: Connie 's outside . Michael does n't want to see her .
MICHAEL: All right . Apologize to Pentangeli .
MERLE: I think this concerns me too . You do n't , do you ?
CONNIE: How are you , honey ? You 've met Merle , have n't you . He was with me in Vegas .
MICHAEL: I saw him with you .
CONNIE: We 're going to Europe next week . I want to get passage booked on the Queen .
MICHAEL: Why do you come to me ? Why do n't you go to a travel agent ?
MERLE: We 're going to get married first .
MICHAEL: The ink on your divorce is n't dry . Your children see you on weekends ; your oldest boy , Michael Francis was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you do n't even know about .
CONNIE: Michael
MICHAEL: You fly around the world with lazy young men who do n't have any love for you , and use you like a whore .
CONNIE: You 're not my father !
MICHAEL: Then why do you come to me ?
CONNIE: Because I need MONEY !
MICHAEL: Connie , I want to be reasonable with you . You have a house here , with us . You can live here with your kidsand you wo n't be deprived of anything . I do n't know much about Merle ; I do n't know what he does for a living ; what he lives on . Why do n't you tell him marriage is really out of the question ; and that you ca n't see him any more . He 'll understand . But if you disobey me , and marry this pimpit would disappoint me .
CONNIE: It was my father 's money ; and I 'm entitled to what I need . Where is Tom Hagen ?
MICHAEL: Are you finished ?
MERLE: I think so .
MICHAEL: Then out .
PENTANGELI: I ca n't believe that out of thirty professional musicians , not one of you is Italian ! C'mon , give us a tarantella .
MICHAEL: Rocco , his friends must be hungry . See what you can do , but I 'd like to keep them away from the guests .
OLA: Sure , I remember Tom from the old days .
MICHAEL: Tom is n't going to sit in with us , Johnny . He only handles specific areas of the family business . Tom ?
HAGEN: Sure , Mikey .
MICHAEL: Just tell Rocco I 'm waiting .
OLA: I just left our friend in Miami .
MICHAEL: How is his health ?
OLA: Not good .
MICHAEL: Is there anything I can do ; anything I can send ?
OLA: He appreciates your concern , Michael , and your respect .
MICHAEL: He 's very kind , tell him it 's appreciated . I 'm sure it will be profitable all the way around .
OLA: He always makes money for his partners . One by one , our old friends are gone . Death , natural or not , prison , deported . Ou friend in Miami is the only one left , because he always made money for his partners .
KAY: Anthony , Daddy 's busy .
MICHAEL: This is my boy , and my wife . Mr. John Ola of Miami .
KAY: I 'm sorry , Michael . Senato Geary 's here , and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left . Wo n't you join us , Mr. Ola ?
MICHAEL: Mr. Ola 's just leaving , Kay . Please tell the Senator I wo n't be a minute . Pause ; she stands there a moment .
KAY: Yes , Michael .
KAY: Anthony ! Anthony , where are you going ?
HAGEN: Where 's my wife ?
SANDRA: With Mama , putting the baby to sleep . Francesca 's very happy . Michael was kind to her . She idolizes him . The children are all out in the speedboat . I 'm going to my house .
MAESTRO: Ladies and gentlemen , a most distinguished guest would like to say a few words Senator and Mrs. Pat Geary of the state of Nevada !
HAGEN: He does n't want my help any more . He does n't need it .
SANDRA: We do n't know that 's true , he neve said that .
HAGEN: I can feel it in the way he talks to me .
SANDRA: Talk to him . Tell him how you feel .
HAGEN: It 's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny .
SANDRA: We have a little time now .
SENATOR GEARY: my thanks , and the thanks of the young people of the State of Nevada , for this most impressive endowment made to the University in the name of Anthony Vito Corleone . Thank you , Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone .
MAESTRO: And now , the Nevada Boys ' Choi have prepared a special thank you for Mr. Michael Corleone .
SENATOR GEARY: Where can we meet alone ?
MICHAEL: Find Hagen .
MICHAEL: It was very kind of you to come to my home on this occasion , Senator . My wife has been very concerned with making a good impression on the people who are our neighbors , and your appearance here has made her very happy . If I can eve perform a service for you , you only have to ask .
SENATOR GEARY: I thought we would meet alone .
MICHAEL: I trust these men with my life . They are my right arms ; I can not insult them by sending them away .
SENATOR GEARY: Some water .
MICHAEL: Turnbull is a good man .
SENATOR GEARY: Let 's forget the bullshit , I do n't want to stay here any longer than I have to . You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash , plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross Michael is taken aback ; he looks at Hagen .
MICHAEL: Senator Geary , I speak to you as a usinessman who has made a large investment in your state . I have made that state my home ; plan to aise my children here . The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars ; why would I ever conside paying more ?
SENATOR GEARY: I 'm going to squeeze you , Corleone , ecause I do n't like you ; I do n't like the kind of man you are . I despise your masquerade , and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family .
MICHAEL: We 're all part of the same hypocrisy , Senator . But neve think it applies to my family .
SENATOR GEARY: All right , then let me say you 'll pay me because it 's in you interests to pay me .
MICHAEL: Senator you can have my answer now if you 'd like . Geary turns back .
MAMA: Cent ' Anne .
DEANNA: What 's 'cent ' Anne ? '
FREDO: A hundred yearsit 's a toast .
CONNIE: It means we should all live happily for one hundred years . The family . If my Father were alive , it 'd be true .
MAMA: Connie .
CONNIE: Merle , have you met my sister-in- law Deanna ?
DEANNA: What a pleasure , Merle .
MAMA: Those two are perfect for each other .
MERLE: What 's that mean ?
CONNIE: Mama !
PENTANGELI: Michael , in all respect , I did n't come three thousand miles for dinner .
MICHAEL: I know .
PENTANGELI: When do we talk ?
MICHAEL: After dinner .
KAY: Anthony , you were talking to Mr. Pentangeli ?
ANTHONY: His name is & quot ; Five-Angels. & quot ;
PENTANGELI: Yeah , the kid and me talked Sicilian . A one-way conversation !
MICHAEL: We were all heartbroken at the news ; but that was n't cause to start a war .
PENTANGELI: Okay , now it 's my family in Brooklyn ; and I wan na keep up Clemenza 's loyalty to you . But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move ? You 're too far from the street , Mike , the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast .
MICHAEL: You were unfair with them .
PENTANGELI: Says who ?
MICHAEL: Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died , and then you took over and welched .
PENTANGELI: Clemenza promised them nothing , he hated the sonsuvbitches .
MICHAEL: They feel cheated .
PENTANGELI: Michael , you 're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family .
MICHAEL: Your family still carries the name Corleone , and you will run it like a Corleone !
PENTANGELI: And while I feed my family in New York , you put the knife in my back in Miami .
MICHAEL: Frankie , you 're a good old man , and you 've been loyal to my Father fo yearsso I hope you can explain what you mean .
PENTANGELI: The Rosatos are running crazy ; taking hostages , spitting in my face , because they 're backed by the Jew in Miami .
MICHAEL: I know . That 's why I want you to e fair with them .
PENTANGELI: How can you be fair with animals ? They recruit niggers and spicks ; they do violence in their own Grandmother 's neighborhoods . And everything is dope and whores ; the gambling is left to last . Let me un my family without you on my ack . I want them taken care of .
MICHAEL: No . There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth . I do n't want them disturbed .
PENTANGELI: You give your loyalty to a Jew ove your own blood .
MICHAEL: Frankie , you know my fathe espected Roth , did business with him .
PENTANGELI: He did businessbut he neve trusted him . Pentangeli takes his hat , and leaves .
NERI: Should he go ?
MICHAEL: The old man had too much vino osso , or he 'd never talk openly that way . Let him go back to New York ; I 've already made my plans . It 's late ; I 've spent so little time at the party .
DEANNA: I wanta dancewhatsa matter with that ?
FREDO: Dancing is alright ; you 're falling on the floor .
DEANNA: Whatsamatter , you do n't want me to dance with him 'cause he 's a man !
FREDO: Deanna , I 'm going to belt you right in the mouth !
DEANNA: These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives .
ROCCO: Freddie , Mike says take care of it , or I have to .
DEANNA: He 's a friend of your brother !
FREDO: Hey Mike , what can I say ?
MICHAEL: Forget it , just go take care of her .
KAY: Sleeping inside me .
MICHAEL: Does it feel like a boy ?
KAY: Yes , Michael , it does .
MICHAEL: I 'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today . It was bad timing but it could n't be helped .
KAY: It made me think of what you told me once . In five years , the Corleone family will be completely legitimate . That was seven years ago .
NERI: Are you Klingman ?
KLINGMAN: Who 's asking ?
NERI: Where can we talk ?
KLINGMAN: Right here .
NERI: I represent the interests of the Corleone family . We make the invitation to you to tie up you affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning .
KLINGMAN: Who do you think you 're talking to ?
NERI: You said you were Klingman .
KLINGMAN: You do n't come in here , talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that .
NERI: You missed my point ; you are no longer an owner .
KLINGMAN: Get out of my hotel . Neri stands in front of him , smiling .
KLINGMAN: All right ! All right , I 'll be out .
NERI: Keep it going .
GENCO: Come on , you 've got to see her !
IMPRESARIO: Carla !
GENCO: The Black Hand .
FANUCCI: Because you protested , it will cost a hundred more .
GENCO: I know what you are thinking , Vitone , but you do n't understand yet how things are . Fanucci is of the Black Hand . Everyone in the neighborhood pays him , even my father .
VITO: He 's an Italian ?
GENCO: A pig of a Neaponitan .
VITO: Why ? Why does he bother othe Italians ?
GENCO: Because he knows them ; he knows they have no one to protect them . Vitone ? What do you think of my angel ?
VITO: Beautiful .
GENCO: Beautiful .
VITO: For you , she is beautiful . For me , there is only my wife !
GENCO: I know . That 's why I brought you with me !
VITO: What ?
GENCO: Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today ; slit his throat from ear to ear .
VITO: No , I did n't know . Is he dead ?
GENCO: Nah . Those guys are n't murderers . They wanted to scare him , that 's all . Make him look bad .
VITO: In Sicily , when you attack a man , you had better finish him .
GENCO: I wish they had . He takes fifty dollars a week from my father 's cash drawer . But you ca n't kill a man like Fanucci .
VITO: Why ?
GENCO: Because he 's what we say & quot ; connected & quot ; You wait , see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue .
FANUCCI: Buon giorno .
GENCO: What did I tell you . The one who cut him was found in an alley . And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance .
VITO: And he agreed ?
GENCO: He took the money . Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood , including Papa .
VITO: A real mafioso does n't sell his vengeance .
SIG. ABBANDANDO: Vitone . How is your son ?
VITO: We are all well .
SIG. ABBANDANDO: VitoneIFanucci has a nephew .
VITO: And you must give him my job . The old man nods , regretfully .
SIG. ABBANDANDO: Vitone !
VITO: Noplease understandI can not accept .
CLEMENZA: Hey Paisan ! Hold this for me until I ask for it . Hurry up !
VITO: We have no money for a rug .
CLEMENZA: No . He would give it away . I know how to repay a consideration . Vito thinks , then nods .
VITO: She would like it .
CLEMENZA: Oh yes , the very best .
CLEMENZA: Good , you waited for us . Clemenza looks up on a higher level .
TESSIO: Who is he ?
AUGUSTINO: My son , Carmineit 's all right .
CLEMENZA: Paisan Augustino was a gunsmith in the Italian army . We do each othe favors .
AUGUSTINO: My boy is studying the flute . He plays very well . He helps me at night so we can buy him a silve flute someday . Now he has one made of wood . Carmineplayplay fo my friends .
CLEMENZA: Lady , I got a bargain on these dresses . Five dollars each . You got ta pay at least fifteen , maybe twenty in a store . Look at them , first class .
WOMAN: I do n't know which one I like best .
CLEMENZA: You 'd look beautiful in all of these . You should buy at least two .
WOMAN: Are you kidding ? My husband will kill me if he knows I paid five dollars for one dress .
CLEMENZA: You can have two for five . She smiles back .
TESSIO: What took so long ?
CLEMENZA: She could n't decide .
FANUCCI: Ahhh , young fellow . People tell me you 're rich , you and your two friends . Yet , you do n't show enough respect to send a few dresses to my home . You know I have three daughters .
VITO: My two friends have my share of the money . I 'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler .
FANUCCI: You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner . Do n't be afraid to tell them . Clemenza and I know each other well , he understands these things . Let yourself be guided by him . He has more experience in these matters .
VITO: You must understand , this is all new to me
FANUCCI: I understand
VITO: But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather .
FANUCCI: You 're a good fellow .
TESSIO: Do you think he 'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars ? I think he would .
CLEMENZA: That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler . He wo n't take a dime less than three hundred dollars .
TESSIO: What if we do n't pay ?
CLEMENZA: You know his friendsreal animals . And his connections with the police . Sure he 'd like us to tell him ou plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude . Then they would owe him a favor ; that 's how he operates . We 'll have to pay . Three hundred , are we agreed ?
TESSIO: What can we do ?
CLEMENZA: They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood .
VITO: If you like , why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci . I guarantee he will accept that amount from me .
TESSIO: When Fanucci says two hundred he means two hundred . You ca n't talk with him .
VITO: I 'll reason with him . Leave everything in my hands . I 'll settle this problem to you satisfaction . Tessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously .
CLEMENZA: Vitone ! Our driver has drunk too much wine .
TESSIO: He 's going to kill Fanucci .
CLEMENZA: Then , after that , what ? Joe 'Little Knife ' Pisani ; Willie Bufalino , maybe , Mr. Maranzalla himself , c'mon !
VITO: Fanucci is not connected ; he is alone .
CLEMENZA: What ? You read it in the papers ?
VITO: This man informs to the police ; this man allows his vengeance to be ought off No , he is alone .
TESSIO: If you 're wrong
VITO: If I 'm wrong , they will kill me .
CLEMENZA: All three daughters are at church ; he is alone . It 's important that you let his neighbors see you leave . Tessio has broken the latch on the skylight of his building . The wheel stops ; they both lose .
PRIEST: It 's only the way we collect that 's different .
FANUCCI: I think there 's only two hundred dollars under my hat . I 'm right . Only two hundred dollars .
VITO: I 'm a little short . I 've been out of work . Let me owe you the money for a few weeks .
FANUCCI: Ah , you 're a sharp young fellow . How is it I 've never noticed you efore You 're too quiet for your own interest . I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable . No hard feelings , eh ? If I can ever do you a service let me know . You 've done a good job for yourself tonight .
WOMAN: 'Good evening , ' Signor Fanucci .
VITO: Santino , your papa loves you .
MICHAEL: Ca n't you sleep ? No answer .
ANTHONY: Yes .
MICHAEL: Did you like your party ?
ANTHONY: I got lots of presents .
MICHAEL: Do you like them ?
ANTHONY: I did n't know the people who gave them to me .
MICHAEL: They were friends . He kisses his boy , and then turns .
ANTHONY: Did you see my present for you ?
MICHAEL: No , where is it ?
ANTHONY: On your pillow .
MICHAEL: I 'm leaving very early tomorrow , efore you wake up .
ANTHONY: I know . How long will you be gone ?
MICHAEL: Just a few days .
ANTHONY: Will you take me ?
MICHAEL: I ca n't .
ANTHONY: Why do you have to go ?
MICHAEL: To do business .
ANTHONY: I can help you .
MICHAEL: Some day you will . Michael kisses him again .
KAY: Michael ? Why are the drapes open ?
MICHAEL: Go with the kids .
ROCCO: They 're still on the property . Maybe you better stay inside .
MICHAEL: Keep them alive . Six men take up posts by Michael 's house .
ROCCO: We 'll try .
MICHAEL: It 's important . He returns inside .
MICHAEL: It will be all right . We were lucky .
ROCCO: Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses ; your Mother 's still sleeping .
MICHAEL: And ?
ROCCO: No sign of them yet ; but they 're still on the Estate . We HEAR loud shouting from outside .
FREDO: Deanna , will you get back into the house !
DEANNA: I 'm getting out of here I said ; these guys all have guns !
MICHAEL: Fredo , ca n't you shut that woman up ! Get her in here !
DEANNA: I do n't want to stay here
FREDO: Mike , what can I do , she 's a hysterical woman
KAY: Leave her alone ! You 're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard .
MICHAEL: Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House .
MICHAEL: Sit down , Tom .
HAGEN: But your people Neri Rocco ; you do n't think
MICHAEL: No , I have confidence in thei loyalty but this is life and death , and Tom , you are my brother . Hagen in very moved .
HAGEN: Mikey , I hoped
MICHAEL: No Tom , just listen . All my people are businessmen ; their loyalty is ased on that . One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you thinkand on that basis , anything is possible . Fredo has a good heart , but he is weakand stupid , and stupid people are the most dangerous of all . I 've kept you out of things , Tom , because I 've always known that your instincts were legitimate , and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice , for your own protection . I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny ; I know you were in a position of limited power , and you did your best to advise and caution him . What I am saying is that now , for how long I do not know , you will be the Don . If what I think has happened is true ; I will leave tonight , and absolutely no one will know how to contact me . And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary . I give you complete power over Neri Fredo , everyone . I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children , and the future of this family , solely resting on your judgment and talent .
HAGEN: Will webe able to get who ordered it out of them ?
MICHAEL: I do n't think so . Unless I 'm very wrongthey 're already dead . Killed by someone insidevery frightened that they botched it . That 's why I am going to disappea in a few minutes , and leave everything to you .
HAGEN: But if you 're wrong
MICHAEL: If I 'm wrong There is a KNOCK on the door .
HAGEN: Get rid of the bodies . Tomorrow morning I want a report made to the local police , and paper , that some explosives we keep on the property were accidentally ignited .
SENATOR GEARY: All right , Mr. Hagen , you 've got ten minutes .
HAGEN: Actually , I 've come with good news ; the Corleone family has done you a favor .
SENATOR GEARY: What the hell are you talking about ?
HAGEN: We know you 're a busy man , with plenty of enemies we saw the opportunity to do you a favor , and we did . No strings .
SENATOR GEARY: No strings .
HAGEN: You know there 's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up ; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to you name .
SENATOR GEARY: No one can trace anything to me ; I pride myself on that .
HAGEN: Do you gamble ?
SENATOR GEARY: A little ; what 's so thought- provoking about that ?
HAGEN: Do you owe markers ?
SENATOR GEARY: Maybe two , three thousand dollars .
HAGEN: The Corleone family has paid them off for youas an expression of our esteem . Geary quickly looks through the paid markers .
SENATOR GEARY: There 's thirty grand worth of paid off markers I never owed that much .
HAGEN: Our mistake . But what does it matter ; it was our money . We do n't even expect thanks .
SENATOR GEARY: You paid off thirty grand I neve owed .
HAGEN: We 'll keep it quiet ; the people who know are trustworthythe Committee need n't find out .
SENATOR GEARY: And what 's the price of their not finding out .
HAGEN: Simple . Be friendly like us . Not hostile .
SENATOR GEARY: Thanksfriend .
KAY: Yes .
MAN: I 'm sorry , Mrs. Corleone . We 're not to let you through .
KAY: I 'm going to the market .
MAN: If you could just give us a list , we 'll pick up anything you want .
KAY: Whose orders are these ?
MAN: Mr. Hagen 's , ma'am .
HAGEN: Kay .
KAY: I 'm supposed to stay in my house .
HAGEN: Within the compound will be fine .
KAY: I was supposed to take the children to New England next week .
HAGEN: That 's off now .
KAY: I 'm going to see my parents .
HAGEN: Kay , Michael did n't tell me a lot ; and what he did tell me , I ca n't epeat . But the responsibility fo you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with .
KAY: How long does this go on ?
HAGEN: I do n't know . I 'm sorry , Kay
KAY: Am I a prisoner ?
HAGEN: That 's not the way we look at it .
PURSER: I 'm terribly sorry to disturb you ut we have received two telegrams .
MERLE: Wellcome in .
CONNIE: What is it ?
PURSER: Yes . One is from our office in New York . The check that you wrote fo your passage has been returned .
CONNIE: Ca n't be
MERLE: Why do n't you wire your bank ?
PURSER: The other telegram is from you ank . Your account has been closed and the company is warned not to extend any credit .
CONNIE: I 'll take care of it in Naples .
PURSER: The company hopes so . But for now , we have orders to change you accommodations .
CONNIE: That son of a bitch !
PORTER: Mr. Paul ?
MICHAEL: Yes .
PORTER: You ordered lunch ?
MICHAEL: Put it right there .
MICHAEL: Thank you .
MICHAEL: You 'll wait in the car .
TERRI: I 'm just going to make lunch . How about a tuna fish sandwich ?
MICHAEL: Thank you , Mrs. Roth . She hurries halfway up the staircase .
TERRI: HymanHYMAN , your friend is here . Why do n't you go right upstairs , Mr. Paul ?
MICHAEL: Fine .
TERRI: I 'll give a yell when lunch is ready .
ROTH: Sit down , this is almost over . You follow the baseball games ?
MICHAEL: Not for a few years .
ROTH: I like sporting events I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon . One of the things I love about this country . I loved baseball eve since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919I heard you had some trouble .
MICHAEL: Yes .
ROTH: What a mistake ; people behaving like that , with guns . It was my understanding we left all that behind . But , let me tell you , the important thing is that you 're all right . Good health is the most important thing ; more than success ; more than power ; more than money .
MICHAEL: The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of . I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement ; I wanted to clear everything I 'm going to do with you , just in case .
ROTH: You 're a considerate young man .
MICHAEL: You 're a great man , Mr. Roth , I have much to learn from you .
ROTH: However I can help you
MICHAEL: The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past ; I understand that they are under you protection .
ROTH: We do favors for each other
MICHAEL: Technically , they are still unde the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family , now run by Frankie Pentangeli . After Clemenza died , the Rosatos wanted territory of their own . Pentangeli refused , and came to me , asking for permission to eliminate them . I , of course , knew of their relationship with you , and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter , turned him down . Pentangeli was furious , and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed . I was lucky and he was stupid . I 'll visit him soon . The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans , yours and mine . This thing of ours , that we will build . The old man touches Michael 's hand , warmly .
ROTH: Nothing is more important .
MICHAEL: Pentangeli is a dead man ; do you object ?
ROTH: It 's always bad for business ; but you have no choice .
MICHAEL: Then it 's done . I must choose his eplacement it can not be Rosato .
ROTH: Of course you must keep control of your family .
TERRI: My goodness , you 'll rupture you eardrums , Hyman .
PENTANGELI: Rosato , where 's your brother ?
ROSATO: Sitting right behind you . Pentangeli glances behind himself .
PENTANGELI: He do n't want to talk ?
ROSATO: We worked it all out beforehand .
PENTANGELI: Are we going to eat or what ?
ROSATO: Sure , on me . I got Diner 's Club .
PENTANGELI: Forget it ; I 'm suddenly without an appetite . You 're making big trouble , Carmine .
ROSATO: You were n't straight with us , Frankie , what else could we do ?
PENTANGELI: We could have talked first , saved a lot of running around .
ROSATO: You was n't listening , you did n't want to talk .
PENTANGELI: Do n't I look like I 'm listening ?
ROSATO: We want Brooklyn one hundred percent . No more taxes to you . We want to be only loosely connected with your family sort of a under-family all of our own . Then we can act on all internal matters without talking . Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him .
PENTANGELI: I 'm a little hungry , maybe I 'll order something . Joe . Get me some bracciole or something . And pay cash . And in return for these concessions , what do you do for me ?
ROSATO: We will release the hostages , number one . Number two , we 're here for you to count on when you need us . We 're independent , but we 're here if you need us . In general , we 'll cooperate with you and you usinesses , and you in turn will cooperate with us . Pari persu .
PENTANGELI: Pari Persu ; what the fuck is Pari persu ?
ROSATO: My lawyer went over this beforehand .
PENTANGELI: What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping , no more hits ?
ROSATO: The same assurance we got from you .
PENTANGELI: What if I say shove it ?
ROSATO: Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted fo slabs .
PENTANGELI: You want a war ?
ROSATO: We got no choice .
PENTANGELI: You know if there 's a way I 'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me . That puts me and the other New York families against you .
ROSATO: We got friends in the commission .
PENTANGELI: I 'm talking about Italians !
ROSATO: What about Michael Corleone ?
PENTANGELI: He supports me .
ROSATO: Maybe , yes maybe no .
PENTANGELI: You drove old Pete Clemenza to his grave , Carmine ; you and you other . Turning on him ; trouble in his territories you and you demands . I hold you responsible , just as though you shot him in the head . And I ai n't gon na let that go for long !
PENTANGELI: What 's this ?
WIFE: Michael Corleone .
PENTANGELI: One Michael CorleoneDove ?
WIFE: He 's in your study .
PENTANGELI: Don Corleone , I wish you let me know you was coming . We could have prepared something for you .
MICHAEL: I did n't want you to know I was coming . You heard what happened in my home ?
PENTANGELI: Michael , yes , we was all relieved
MICHAEL: In my home ! In the same room where my wife was sleeping ; where my children come in their pajamas , and play with their toys .
PENTANGELI: Michael , anything . What is it I can do for you ?
MICHAEL: I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers .
PENTANGELI: I was just going to contact you , Michael ; we just had a 'sit-down ' - in fact , I just come from there .
MICHAEL: I want you to settle on their terms .
PENTANGELI: Mike , I do n't understand . Do n't ask me to do that .
MICHAEL: Trust me ; do as I ask .
PENTANGELI: It would be the beginning of the end for my family . How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that , and then give it to them ?
MICHAEL: Frankiedo you respect me ? Do I have your loyalty ?
PENTANGELI: Always But sometimes I do n't understand . I know I 'll never have your kind of brains , in big deals . But Mike , this is a street thing . And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers .
MICHAEL: I know .
PENTANGELI: Then why do you want me to lay down to them ?
MICHAEL: Frankie , Roth tried to have me killed . I 'm sure it was him , but I do n't know yet why .
PENTANGELI: Jesus Christ , Michael , then let 's hit 'em now , while we still got the muscle .
MICHAEL: This was my father 's old study . When I was a kid , we had to be quiet when we played near here . When I was older , I learned many things from him here . I was happy that this house never went to strangers ; first Clemenza took it over , and then you . My fathe taught me , in this room , never to act until you know everything that 's behind things . Never . If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers ' favor , he 'll think his relationship with me is still sound . I 'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow . We have friends in some very important usiness that we 're making . Do this for me ; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on thei terms . Let the word out that I forced you ; you 're not happy wit hit , but acquiesced , just because of me . It will get back to Hyman Roth . Do this , Frankie . You can trust me .
PENTANGELI: Sure , Mike . I 'll go along .
MICHAEL: Good .
NERI: Fifteen percent skim ?
HAGEN: Twenty-five this time . The accountant stops , and looks up to Neri .
NERI: It might show .
HAGEN: Mike wants it .
NERI: We 've never sent this much with one courier .
HAGEN: Your plans are a little different this time . You skip Miami , and go straight to Geneva . It 's to be deposited to this number . And it 's got to be there by Monday morning , no slip-up .
COURIER: I think I was 'picked-up ' last trip . That hour layover I had at Kennedy . I went over and bought a paper
NERI: Those were our people .
COURIER: Okay , just thought you should know .
HAGEN: Let them count .
NERI: What 's up ?
HAGEN: No questions .
NERI: I got to ask questions , Tom , there 's three million dollars cash in that pouch ; Mike is gone and I have no word from him .
HAGEN: Al , as far as you 're concerned , I 'm the Don .
NERI: How do I know you have n't gone into usiness for yourself ?
HAGEN: You 've been through a lot with us so I 'm going to give you the truth . Mike knows it was someone within the compound that set him up fo that hit . So nobody is to know where he is , not you , not Rocco , not even his brother Fredo . Sorry , Al , I know how you feel about Mikebut he still remembers Tessio .
THERESA: Hungry ?
HAGEN: Just a little .
THERESA: I 've invited Mama , Sandra and the kids for barbecue .
HAGEN: What about Kay ?
THERESA: I could n't find her . She 's been so oody , sticks to herself .
HAGEN: Let me try Kay .
HAGEN'S SON: Hey , Pop , heads up !
HAGEN: Kay ?
SANDRA: The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came y in a new speedboat . Rocco tried to say she was n't in , but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ide . That was three hours ago .
HAGEN: Why did n't someone tell me !
SANDRA: I wanted to tell you alone ; you wife does n't know what 's going on . Hagen rushes out of the house .
HAGEN'S SON: Hey , Dad !
HAGEN: Rocco !
ROCCO: I know . I went down to the Barrett house . But she 's gone . They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport .
HAGEN: Goddamn it , where were you ?
ROCCO: I was in my house . Willy tried , ut it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her , and he figured you would n't want that .
HAGEN: Get me a Scotch and water . The man hurries behind the bar .
ROCCO: She took a flight to San Francisco . We figure she 's going to connect to New Hampshire ; her parents ' place .
HAGEN: I ca n't let him down .
ROCCO: Me too , Tom ?
HAGEN: Yeah , give me a minute .
CAPTAIN: Habana , Habana .
SAM ROTH: Hiya , Mr. Corleone , I 'm Sam Roth . Welcome to the Capri ; my brother 's upstairs . You wanta take a rest efore you see him , or can I get you something , anything at all ?
MICHAEL: No , I 'm fine . He leads Michael into the main casino .
SAM ROTH: This is it ! We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game .
MICHAEL: Very impressive .
SAM ROTH: Jake , Jake , come over here . Mike , I want you to meet Jake Cohen ; he manages the casino for us .
COHEN: Mr. Corleone .
SAM ROTH: Pleasure to meet you , I 'm sure He gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta .
LEON: Most respected gentlemen , allow me to welcome you to the City of Havana , the Republic of Cuba on ehalf of His Excellency , Fulgencio Batista .
CORNGOLD: Your Excellency , perhaps you could discuss the status of rebel activity and how this may affect ou usinesses .
LEON: We began a highly successful offensive against them in March , and activities within the city itself are at a minimum . I can assure you we 'll tolerate no guerrillas in the casinos o swimming pools ! General subdued laughter .
DRIVER: He says it will just be a short time and they 'll let us through . Michael looks out the window .
MAN: Cuba Libres .
MICHAEL: I was told the Cubans now call this drink & quot ; La Mentira. & quot ;
ROTH: I still do n't speak Spanish , Michael .
MICHAEL: It means & quot ; The Lie. & quot ;
SAM ROTH: The cake is here . They all raise their glasses to the old man .
EVERYONE: Happy Birthday !
ROTH: I hope my age is correct I am always accurate about my age .
ANOTHER MAN: What are import duties now ?
ROTH: As much as seventy percent . Also , I 'm working out an arrangement with the Minister of Labor so that all our pit bosses , stick-men and Dealers , can be considered specialized technicians eligible for two year visas . As of now they 're only allowed in Cuba fo six months at a time . In short , we 're in a full partnership with the Cuban Government .
ROTH: Then there 's the Sevilla Biltmore ; the Havana Hilton , which is going to cost twenty-four million Cuban banks will put up half , the Teamsters will bankroll the rest . Generally , there will be friends for all our friends including the Lieutenant Governor of Nevada ; Eddie Levine of Newport will bring in the Pennino Brothers , Dino and Eddie ; they 'll handle actual casino operations .
MICHAEL: I saw an interesting thing today . A man was being arrested by the Military Police ; probably an urban guerrilla . Rather than be taken alive , he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket , taking the command vehicle with him .
SAM ROTH: So ?
MICHAEL: So , that occurred to me .
ROTH: This country has had rebels for the last fifty years ; it 's part of their blood . Believe me , I know I 've been coming here since the twenties ; we were running molasses out of Havana when you were a baby . To trucks owned by your father . We 'll talk when we 're alone .
MICHAEL: We 're making a big investment in Cuba . That 's my only concern .
ROTH: My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista 's numbered account in Switzerland . He thinks it 's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels .
MICHAEL: The money was sent .
ROTH: Then you have to trace it . Michael , people here look at me as a reliable man . I ca n't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man . But you know all that ; there 's nothing you can learn from me . You should n't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner .
MICHAEL: I would n't consider anyone else .
ROTH: Except the President of the United States .
MICHAEL: You 'll be there to see it ; you 'll e there .
OPERATOR: We have your call to Tahoe , Nevada , sir .
MICHAEL: Thank you . Tom ? Tom , is that you ?
KAY: I 'm not surprised to see you , Tom .
HAGEN: Kay Kay
KAY: What kind of a family is this are we human beings ? He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo . He heard Connie .
HAGEN: You do n't know that 's true . But Kay , just for the sake of an argument , let 's assume it is , I 'm not saying it is , remember , but What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did .
KAY: That 's the first time I 've seen the lawyer side of you , Tom . It 's not your best side .
HAGEN: Okay , just hear me out . What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed ? What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open ? Then what ? And what if the Don , a great man , could n't bring himself to do what he had to do , avenge his son 's death by killing his daughter 's husband ? What if that , finally , was too much for him , and he made Michael his successor , knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders , would take that guilt ?
KAY: He 's not the same as when I met him .
HAGEN: If he were , he 'd be dead by now . You 'd be a widow . You 'd have no problem .
KAY: What the hell does that mean ? Come on , Tom , speak out straight once in your life . I know Michael ca n't , ut you 're not Sicilian , you can tell a woman the truth ; you can treat her like an equal , a fellow human being . There is a long silence .
HAGEN: If you told Michael what I 've told you today , I 'm a dead man .
KAY: When is it finally over ? I want it to be over before my baby is born .
HAGEN: I do n't know . I hope soon ; but it 's not over yet , and that 's why you and the kids have to come back to me .
LOUDSPEAKER: Mr. Corleone ; Mr. Freddie Corleone , telephone please .
PIT BOSS: Not here .
LOUDSPEAKER: Telephone for Mr. Corleone .
NERI: He 's backstage .
FREDO: C'mon , you got fifteen minutes efore the finale ! I want to show you a trick with feathers .
STAGEHAND: Phone for you .
FREDO: Do n't go away ; wait a minute .
PENTANGELI: Wait in the car .
PENTANGELI: What 's this ?
ROSATO: That 's a lucky C note for our new deal .
PENTANGELI: I do n't like the C-note . I take it like an insult .
ROSATO: Shit , your friend the cop !
COP: Everything all right in there , Ritchie ? The door was open .
RITCHIE: Just cleaning up . You okay ?
COP: Is that something on the floor ?
ROSATO: Take him !
VOICE: Okay .
RITCHIE: Not here ; not a cop , not here !
COP: Stutz ! Watch out , Stutz !
PENTANGELI: The bastard . The dirty bastard , he gave me a C-note . He gave me a C- note . He sees the patrolman leaning over him .
SERGEANT: Frankie Pentangeli murder attempt . Patrolman Stutz shot . Sahara Lounge - Utica Avenue and Claredon Road . White Cadillac three or fou men took off from scene . Need ambulance ; Stutz is bad . Taking Pentangeli into custody
ROTH: Make it fast ; I do n't want to chance him being seen .
COURIER: What about the arrangements ? How can I be sure about the arrangements ?
OLA: Relax . You 're under our protection ; the Corleone family will never find you .
COURIER: Hey , what 's this ?
FREDO: Mikey . How are you ?
MICHAEL: Mio fratello . Then Bussetta offers his hand back to Fredo .
FREDO: What a trip , Jesus Christ , the whole time I 'm thinking what if someone knew what I got in here .
MICHAEL: It 's all right . He stays with me all the time .
FREDO: Oh . Mikey , what 's up ? I 'm totally in the dark .
MICHAEL: We 're making an investment in Havana .
FREDO: Great , Havana 's great . Lots of activity in Havana ! Anybody I know here . Five-Angels ? Anybody ?
MICHAEL: Johnny Ola Hyman Roth .
FREDO: I never met them .
MICHAEL: Pentangeli 's dead . He was ambushed y the Rosato Brothers . Did n't you know that ?
FREDO: No . No , I did n't . Who tells me anything ? I been kept in the dark so long , I 'm getting used to it .
MICHAEL: I want you to help me , Fredo .
FREDO: That 's what I 'm here for .
MICHAEL: Tonight I want to relax with you . The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington . I want to show them a good time in Havana .
FREDO: Count on me ; that 's my specialty .
MICHAEL: I 'd like to come along . There 's een a lot of strain , and I 've been cooped up in this room for three days .
FREDO: Me and you , great ! Gim me an hou to wash my face and do my research and we 'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em . Poor Frankie Five-Angels . He always wanted to die in bedwith a broad .
DOCTOR: You must not exert yourself ; I will write out a prescription and come ack tomorrow .
HOTEL MAN: He 's going to write a prescription .
ROTH: I want my own doctor ; fly him in from Miami . I do n't trust a docto who ca n't speak English .
TERRI: If you feel better
ROTH: I do . Play the Bingo game .
MICHAEL: This doubles my investment .
ROTH: Still no word of your courier ? We 'll find him . But at least this will satisfy our friends here . You 've been invited to the New Yea eception at the Presidential Home . I understand your brother is here as well ; I hope he 'll come .
MICHAEL: Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution .
ROTH: You 're a careful kid , and that 's good . But look . An international dispatch on the wire service . American journalism , not propaganda . The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels . All but their radio station .
MICHAEL: I 've read it ; I 'm pleased that the government is doing so well . As a heavy investor , I 'm pleased . How did the doctor find you ?
ROTH: Terrible . I 'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting .
MICHAEL: Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed ?
ROTH: Whythe Rosato Brothers .
MICHAEL: I know that ; but who gave the go ahead .
ROTH: There was this kid that I grew up with ; he was a couple years younge than me , and sort of looked up to me , you know . We did our first work together , worked our way out of the street . Things were good and we made the most of it . During prohibition , we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune ; you father too . I guess as much as anyone , I loved him and trusted him . Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over fo G.I . 's on the way to the West Coast . That kid 's name was Moe Greene , and the city he invented was Las Vegas . This was a great man ; a man with vision and guts ; and there is n't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town . Someone put a bullet through his eye ; no one knows who gave the order . When I heard about it I was n't angry . I knew Moe ; I knew he was headstrong , and talking loud , and saying stupid things . So when he turned up dead , I let it go , and said to myself this is the business we 've chosen . I never asked , who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business . He regards Michael silently a moment .
MICHAEL: How sick do you think the old man is ?
BUSSETTA: He 'll live longer than me .
FREDO: Does everyone know everyone , o nobody knows nobody . Here , my other , Michael Corleone well , you know Senator Geary . Geary warmly shakes Michael 's hand .
SENATOR GEARY: Good to see you , Mike ; I 'm glad we can spend this time together .
FREDO: This is Senator Payton from Florida ; Judge DeMalco from New York Senator Ream Mr. Questadt from California , he 's a lawyer with the Price-Control Administration . And Fred Corngold of U T & amp ; T .
SENATOR GEARY: I 'll take a Yolanda . Laughter .
FREDO: Later , later . All those girls look like they 're on stilts ! The various tropical drinks are distributed .
SENATOR GEARY: To a night in Havana ! They all join in .
FREDO: Jeeze , it 's great you came along , Mike You know , we 've never spent a night out on the town together . I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time .
MICHAEL: I never looked down on you , Fredo . You do n't look down at a brother .
CORNGOLD: Our information is that Castro is dead . There are maybe a few hundred die-hards in the Sierra Muestra ; but government troops are going to clean them out any day . Johnny Ola approaches Michael .
OLA: Mike , can I talk to you .
MICHAEL: Let him gamble .
OLA: Okay . You know he does n't have that kind of money .
FREDO: Mike said let him gamble .
MICHAEL: No .
FREDO: Wait 'll you see !
MICHAEL: It was hard to have him killed .
FREDO: You ? What do you mean you , I thought
MICHAEL: It was hard to have him killed .
FREDO: You ? What do you mean you , I thought
MICHAEL: It was Frankie tried to have me hit .
FREDO: No . I mean , are you sure ?
MICHAEL: You know otherwise , Freddie ?
FREDO: Me ? NO , no , I do n't know anything . Fellas ! You 're all falling asleep . We got to see Superman .
SENATOR REAM: Goddamn beggers . Goddamn city of eggars and pimps and whores . And we bend over backwards to support them with the goddamn sugar quota .
FREDO: What 's eating him ?
SENATOR GEARY: He lost a quarter million dollars at the casino .
SENATOR REAM: goddamn city of whores
SENATOR GEARY: He gave them a bad check .
QUESTADT: Why do we have to stand ?
FREDO: Everyone stands . But it 's worth it , watch !
SENATOR GEARY: Ohmygod . I do n't believe it .
QUESTADT: It 's got to be fake .
FREDO: That 's why they call him Superman . Johnny Ola told me about this ; I did n't believe it .
RADIO: & quot ; This is Rebel Radio Rebel troops of Column Four 'Jose Marti ' took the town of Baire yesterday at 8 30 p.m . The enemy has retreated & quot ;
RADIO: Victories in war depend on a minimum on weapons and to a maximum on morale
MICHAEL: How is your wife , Fredoyou marriage ?
FREDO: You know her ; drives me crazy , one minute she 's a popsicle , the next she 's all vinegar . Sometimes I think I think - I should a married someone , like you did . To have kids , to have a family .
MICHAEL: & quot ; Yo soy un hombre sincero & quot ; I am a sincere man , From the land of the palms
FREDO: What 's that ?
MICHAEL: The song . Are you sincere with me , Fredo ?
FREDO: Sincere . What are you talking about , of course I 'm sincere with you , Mike .
MICHAEL: Then I 'm going to confide in you ; trust you with something .
FREDO: Mike , are you crazy , I 'm you other .
MICHAEL: Tonight we 've been invited to a eception at the Presidential Palace ; to bring in the New Year . You and I will go in a special ca that 's being sent . They 'll have cocktails then dinner , and a eception with the President . When it 's over , it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women . I 'll go home alone in the car ; and before I each the hotel , I 'll be assassinated .
FREDO: Who ?
MICHAEL: The same man who tried in Nevada Hyman Roth , not Pentangeli .
FREDO: But , you told me yourself
MICHAEL: It was never Pentangeli I 've always known that . It was Roth all along . He talks to me as a son ; as his successor , but the old man thinks he 'll live forever .
FREDO: What do you want me to do ?
MICHAEL: To go tonight , with me , as though we know nothing . I 've already made my move .
FREDO: What is it ? Can I help ?
MICHAEL: The old man will never bring in the New Year .
QUESTADT: The embargo on arms shipments from the U.S. to your government , was just a necessary public relations move Only last month , your ai force received a major shipment of ockets
SENATOR GEARY: We believe in non-intervention ut the agreement stipulates that our forces may be withdrawn but as you 've seen , we have not withdrawn them .
CORNGOLD: And my guess is that President Eisenhower wo n't pull out while we have over three billion invested over here .
MICHAEL: Fredo . Where are you going ?
FREDO: Nowhere , Mike . I wanted to get a efill . How about you ?
QUESTADT: What 's kept Mr. Roth ? Fredo looks up at Michael .
MICHAEL: I 've arranged for a plane ; we 're going to Miami in an hour . Try not to make a big thing of it . He kisses his brother once again .
LEON: What a pity ; she 's crying . Must have been fired , and she 's been with the President 's family fo twenty years .
PRESIDENT: Because of serious setbacks of our troops in Guantanamo and Santiago , we feel reluctantly , that we must leave the Capital at once . Myself and my family must bid you goodbye , and good fortune . We will go directly to Ciudad Trujillo .
MICHAEL: Come with me . It 's your only way of getting out !
PILOT: No , this is a private plane . No , this plane is taken .
MICHAEL: He is n't here .
PILOT: We 've got to leave , they 'll take this thing apart .
MICHAEL: All right . Go now .
VENDOR: No , no . It is my pleasure to make this a gift .
VITO: You are kind . If ever I can do something for you , in return , please come to me .
CARMELLA: Come
VITO: Why do you come to me ?
SIGNORA COLOMBO: She told me to ask you . He seems surprised ; looks to his wife .
CARMELLA: She is having some trouble . He landlord has received complaints ecause of her dog . He told her to get rid of it , but her boy loved it , so they tried to hide it . When the landlord found out , he was so angry , he ordered her to leave . Even if she truly will let the dog go .
SIGNORA COLOMBO: He said he would have the police put us out .
VITO: I can give you some money to help you move , is that what you want ?
SIGNORA COLOMBO: My friends are all here ; how can I move to another neighborhood with strangers ? I want you to speak to the landlord to let me stay . Vito nods to the frightened old woman .
VITO: It 's done then . You wo n't have to move ; I 'll speak to him tomorrow morning .
SIGNORA COLOMBO: You 're sure he 'll say yes , the landlord ?
VITO: I 'm sure he 's a good-hearted fellow . Once I explain how things are with you , I 'm sure he 'll take pity on your misfortunes . Do n't let it trouble you any more . Guard your health , for the sake of your children .
ROBERTO: I have already rented the apartment to another family .
VITO: I told her I would speak to you , that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding . She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble , so why should n't she stay . As one Italian to another , I ask you the favor .
ROBERTO: I 've already rented it ; I can not disappoint the new tenants . They 're paying a higher rent .
VITO: How much more a month ?
ROBERTO: Eh Five dollars more .
VITO: Here is the six month 's increase in advance . You need n't speak to he about it , she 's a proud woman . See me again in another six months . But of course , you 'll let her keep her dog .

I wo n't quarrel with it . Do me this little favor , just take it and think carefully . Tomorrow morning if you want to give me the money back , by all means do so . If you want the woman out of you house , how can I stop you ? It 's your property , after all . If you do n't want the dog in there , I can understand . I dislike dogs myself . Do me this service , eh ? I wo n't forget it . Ask your friends in this neighborhood about me , they 'll tell you I 'm a man who believes in showing his gratitude .

CLEMENZA: That 's 'cause he 's Jew . Look at those pregnant lips ! He giggles at his own joke .
ITALIAN BOY: Are you a Jewboy ? The boy does n't answer , tries to keep going .
CLEMENZA: Alright , alright , cut it out .

CICCI: No , Senator , I never talked to him .
SENATOR SAVOY: There was always a buffer , someone in between you who gave you orders .
CICCI: Yeah , a buffer , the Family had a lot of buffers .
MICHAEL: Do you think they have somebody to ack up Cicci ?
HAGEN: No . But if they do have somebody , you 'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name .
MICHAEL: Al , get me a wet towel . Does Kay know I 'm back ? Hagen nods .
HAGEN: I took care of it .
MICHAEL: What was it , so I 'll know .
HAGEN: A little care he can ride in with an electric motor .
MICHAEL: Fellas , can you wait outside a minute ?
HAGEN: Roth got out on a private boat . He 's in a hospital in Miami . Had a stroke but he 's recovered okay . Bussetta 's dead .
MICHAEL: I asked about Fredo ?
HAGEN: The new government arrested him , held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people , including Roth 's brother , Sam . The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens ; I 'm not sure , but I think he 's somewhere in New York .
MICHAEL: I want you to reach Fredo . I know he 's scared , but have one of ou people reach him . Assure him that there will be no reprisals . Tell him that I know Roth misled him .
HAGEN: My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping . Roth assured him nothing would happen to you .
MICHAEL: They can come in now .
HAGEN: Wait there 's something else .
MICHAEL: Alright . Hagen pauses ; does n't know how to begin .
HAGEN: Kay had a miscarriage ; she lost the aby . After a moment
MICHAEL: Was it a boy or a girl ?
HAGEN: Mike , at three and a half
MICHAEL: What is it , ca n't you give me straight answers anymore !
HAGEN: It was a boy .
MICHAEL: And Kayshe 's all right ?
HAGEN: She took the Senate Investigation worse .
MICHAEL: Does she blame it on me ? The baby ?
HAGEN: I do n't know .
MICHAEL: Mom Mom
MAMA: I 'm alright . Will you stay home for awhile ?
MICHAEL: There are still things I have to do .
MAMA: Well , we can all have a nice dinne together tonight . How are your eyes ?
MICHAEL: Alright . They bother me once in awhile . Tell me , when Pop had troubles did he ever think , even to himself , that he had gone the wrong way ; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family , that he could that he could lose it instead ?
MAMA: You talk about the baby . She can have another baby .
MICHAEL: No , I meant lose his family .
MAMA: Your family ? How can you ever lose your family ?
MICHAEL: But times are different
TOMASINO: Don Francesco , if you will hono me , by allowing me to introduce my associate in America , in New York . His name is Vito Corleone .
DON FRANCESCO: Where is this young man ?
TOMASINO: He is right here , standing next to me , Don Francesco .
DON FRANCESCO: Have him come closer , I ca n't see very well .
VITO: Vito Corleone .
DON FRANCESCO: You took the name of this town , eh ? What was your father 's name ?
VITO: Antonio Andolini .
DON FRANCESCO: Kill him ! Kill him ! But he is too late ; Vito steps forward .
VITO: In the name of my Father , and my Brother
MICHAEL: Yes .
SENATOR KING: Did he use at times an alias ? Was this alias in certain circles
MICHAEL: It was not an alias . GODFATHER was a term of affection , used by his friends , one of respect .
SENATOR WEEKLER: Let me agree with that . Many of my constituents are Italian and have een honored with that certain friendship by my close Italian friends . Up to this point before I have to leave this hearing to join my own committee , let me say , that this hearing on the Mafia is in no way a slur on the Italians by the Senate ; nor is it meant to be ; no will I allow it to be . Italian Americans are the hardest working , most law abiding patriotic Americans of our country . It is a shame and a pity that a few rotten apples give them a bad name . We are here to weed those rotten apples out of the vast healthy barrel of Italian Americans , who are one of the ackbones of our country .
SENATOR KANE: I 'm sure we all agree with ou esteemed colleague . Now , Mr. Corleone , you have been advised as to your legal rights . We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country . Are you ?
MICHAEL: No .
SENATOR KANE: This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo . Do you deny this ?
MICHAEL: I deny his every charge .
SENATOR KANE: Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York , to assume and consolidate you nefarious power ?
MICHAEL: That is a complete falsehood .
SENATOR KANE: Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas ?
MICHAEL: That is not true . I own some stock in some of the hotels , but only very small amounts . I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock .
SENATOR ROGERS: Why is it necessary for you counsel to advise you on that question ?
MICHAEL: Senator , I 've observed the head of General Motors before a Senate Committee , and his lawyer whispered in his ear . That was not commented upon in the way you have just done .
SENATOR KANE: Mr. Corleone , do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona ? Or any gambling interests in that state ?
MICHAEL: I do not .
SENATOR KANE: Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York .
MICHAEL: I do not .
HAGEN: Senator , my client would like to ead a statement for the record .
SENATOR KANE: I do n't think that 's necessary .
HAGEN: Sir , my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity . He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do , and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing , counsel advised him to do . So , I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record .
SENATOR KANE: Very well .
MICHAEL: In the hopes of clearing my family name , in the sincere desire to give my children their fair share of the American way of life without a lemish on their name and background I have appeared before this committee and given it all the cooperation in my power . I conside my being called before this committee an act of prejudice to all Americans of Italian extraction . I consider it a great dishonor to me personally to have to deny that I am a criminal . I wish to have the following noted for the record . That I served my country faithfully and honorably in World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions in defense of my country . That I have never been arrested or indicted fo any crime whatsoever that no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy , whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whateve other name you wish to give , has ever been made public . Only one man has made charges against me , and that man is known to be a murderer , arsonist and rapist . And yet this committee had used this person to besmirch my name . My personal protest can only be made to the people of this country . I can only thank God that in this country we have a legal system and courts of law to protect innocent people from wild accusation . I thank God for our democratic due process of Law that shields me from the false charges made by this committee 's witness . I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment , though counsel advised me to do so . I challenge this committee to produce any witness o evidence against me , and if they do not , I hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have now besmirched it . I ask this without malice , in the interests of fair play .
SENATOR ROGERS: We are all impressed . The committee will now recess over the weekend . However , it will continue Monday morning , at eleven a.m. At that time , this committee will then produce a witness directly linking Mr. Corleone to the charges we have made . And then , Mr. Corleone may very well by liable for indictments of perjury . However , this document will be made a matter of record .
PENTANGELI: Ten to one shot , you said . Ten to one shot in my favor , and I lose .
MICHAEL: How did they get their hands on Pentangeli ?
HAGEN: Roth engineered it , Michael . He made Pentangeli think you hit him . Deliberately letting him get off alive . Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI . My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him . Anyway , they had him on possession , dealing in heroin , murder one and a lot more . There 's no way we can get to him and you 've opened yourself to five points of perjury .
NERI: They 've got him airtight . He 's in a military base , twenty-four hou guards . Trying to kill him is like trying to like the President it 's impossible .
MICHAEL: What does Fredo know ?
HAGEN: He says he does n't know anything , and I believe him . Roth played this one beautifully .
MICHAEL: Alright . I 'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo .
FREDO: I do n't have a lot to say , Michael .
MICHAEL: We have time .
FREDO: I was kept pretty much in the dark . I did n't know all that much .
MICHAEL: What about now , is there anything you can help me out with ?
FREDO: I know they get Pentangeli , that 's all I know .
MICHAEL: And you believed that story .
FREDO: He said there was something good in it for meme on my own .
MICHAEL: I 've always taken care of you .
FREDO: Taken care of me . Mike , you 're my kid brother , and you take care of my . Did you ever think of that . Ever once ? Send Fredo off to do this , send Fredo to take care of that take care of some little unimportant night club here , and there ; pick somebody up at the airport . Mike , I 'm your olde other ; I was stepped over !
MICHAEL: It 's the way Pop wanted it .
FREDO: It was n't the way I wanted it ! I can handle things . I 'm not dum Christ , not like everyone says . I 'm smart ; and I want respect .
MICHAEL: There 's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation ?
FREDO: The lawyer ; Questadt , he belongs to Roth .
MICHAEL: You 're nothing to me now , Fredo ; not a brother , not a friend , I do n't want to know you , or what happens to you . I do n't want to see you at the hotels , or near my home . When you visit our Mother , I want to know a day in advance , so I wo n't be there . Do you understand ?
FREDO: Mikey ?
MICHAEL: I do n't want anything to happen to him while my Mother 's alive . Michael leaves .
PENTANGELI: Let 's go .
SENATOR KANE: We have here a witness who will testify further on Michael Corleone 's rule of the criminal empire that controls gambling in this country and perhaps in othe countries . This witness had no uffer between himself and Michael Corleone . He can corroborate ou charges on enough counts for this committee to consider a charge of perjury against Michael Corleone . Your name please , for the record .
PENTANGELI: Frank Pentangeli .
SENATOR KANE: Were you a member of the Corleone Family ? Were you under the Caporegime Peter Clemenza , unde Vito Corleone , known as the Godfather ? There is a long silence .
PENTANGELI: I never knew no Godfather . I got my own family .
SENATOR KANE: Mr. Pentangeli , you are contradicting your confessions to our investigators ; I ask you again , were you a member of a crime organization headed by Michael Corleone ?
PENTANGELI: No . I never heard of it . I neve heard of nothing like that . I was in the olive oil business with his father a long time ago . That 's all .
SENATOR KANE: We have your confession that you murdered on the orders of Michael Corleone . Do you deny that confession and do you know what denying that confession will mean to you ?
PENTANGELI: The FBI guys promised me a deal . So I made up a lot of stuff about Michael Corleone . Because then , that 's what they wanted . But it was all lies . Everything . They said Michael Corleone did this , Michael Corleone did that . So I said , & quot ; Yeah , sure. & quot ;
SENATOR KANE: Mr. Hagen , would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand ?
HAGEN: Yes , sir . His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli .
SENATOR KANE: Is he related to the witness ?
HAGEN: He is , I believe , a brother .
SENATOR KANE: Sir , I would like you to take the stand .
HAGEN: Sir , the gentleman does not understand English . He would not in any case , take the stand . He came , at his own expense , to aid his brother in his trouble . He is not under any jurisdiction of ou government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable .
SENATOR KANE: The witness is excused ; take him out .
HAGEN: Senator Kane .
SENATOR KANE: This meeting is adjourned .
HAGEN: This committee owes an apology !
SENATOR KANE: The committee is adjourned until further notice .
ROCCO: It 's Kay .
MICHAEL: On the phone ?
ROCCO: No , she 's here .
MICHAEL: I had no idea
KAY: I wanted to see you before you went ack to Nevada . Also , the children - Michael , they 're here .
MICHAEL: Where ?
KAY: In a minute . They 're outside with Esther . I 'm very happy for you I suppose I knew that you 're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you .
MICHAEL: Why do n't you sit down ?
KAY: I 'm not going to stay long ; I ca n't .
MICHAEL: There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about . Things I 've een thinking about changes I want to make .
KAY: I think it 's too late for changes , Michael . I promised myself I would n't talk about it and I 've gone and spoiled it .
MICHAEL: Why too late ?
KAY: Tell me , Michael . What really happened with Pentangeli ?
MICHAEL: His brother came to help him .
KAY: I did n't even know he had a brother . And where is he now ?
MICHAEL: On a plane back to Sicily .
KAY: And that 's all he had to do . Just show his face .
MICHAEL: That 's all . You see , in Sicily , in the old days there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood elative only one . IF he was a traitor .
KAY: You would have killed his brother ?
MICHAEL: Kay , you 've got it wrong . That kind of thing 's all over , I promised you . This was between the two others . Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend ; he called her his co-wife . That was his joke , but he meant it . He would n't divorce his wife because she was a great cook . He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could neve marry her . He set her up in a house in Jersey . She had to be faithful and she had to have kids . And she did , two , a boy and a girl . He had her checked out and watched so she could n't cheat but the girl could n't stand that kind of life . She begged him to let her go . He did . He gave her money and made her give up the kids . Then Frankie took them to Italy , and had them ought up by his brother Vincenzo . Where he knew they 'd by safe . Kay begins to realize .
KAY: I 'll bring the children up now ; they want to say goodbye .
MICHAEL: Kay , I told you
KAY: Goodbye , Michael .
MICHAEL: I wo n't let you leave ! Christ , do you think I 'm going to let you leave .
KAY: Michael .
MICHAEL: No , I do n't want to hear anything . There are things between men and women that will not change ; things that have been the same fo thousands of years . You are my wife , and they are my children and I love you and I will not let you leave , because you are MINE !
KAY: Oh , I do feel things for you , Michael ; but now , I think it 's pity . For the first time since I 've known you , you seem so helpless . You held me a prisoner once ; will you try again ?
MICHAEL: If that 's what it takes ; then yes , I will .
KAY: At this moment , I feel no love fo you at all . I never thought that could happen , but it has .
MICHAEL: We 'll go back tonight . Bring the children .
KAY: You have n't heard me .
MICHAEL: How can I let you leave ; how can I let you take my children away ? Do n't you know me ? You understand , it 's an impossibility . I would never let it happen ; no , never , not if it took all my strength , all my cunning . But in time , soon , you 'll feel differently . You see , you 'll e happy that I stopped you . I know you . You 'll forget about this ; you 'll forget about the baby we lost and we 'll go on , you and
KAY: The baby I lost
MICHAEL: I know what it meant and I 'm prepared to make it up to you . I will make changes ; I can . I CAN change ; that I have learned , that I have the strength to change And we have another child , a boy and you 'll forget the miscarriage .
KAY: It was n't a miscarriage . And you with your cunning , could n't you figure it out ! It was an abortion ; an abortion , like our marriage is an abortion , something unholy and evil . I do n't want your son ; I would n't bring another of your sons into this world . An abortion , Michael it was a son , and I had it killed , but this must all end !
MICHAEL: You wo n't take my children .
FREDO: Tom . Where 's Mike ?
HAGEN: He 's waiting for you to leave .
FREDO: Can I talk to him ?
HAGEN: No chance . I 'm sorry , Freddie .
CONNIE: Can I see him ?
HAGEN: He 's in the boathouse .
CONNIE: I want to stay close to home now , is that alright ? Michael nods .
MICHAEL: No .
CONNIE: Michael , Fredo 's in the house with Mama . He asked for you , and Tom said he could n't see you .
MICHAEL: Tom is right .
CONNIE: Kids , why do n't you go outside fo a while ?
MICHAEL: The children can stay .
CONNIE: I hated you for so long , Michael ; for so many years . I think I did things to myself , to hurt myself , so that you would know and you would be hurt too . But I understand you now ; I think I do . You were eing strong for all of us , like Papa was . And I forgive you , and want to be close to you now . Ca n't you forgive Fredo ; he 's so sweet , and helpless without you .
FREDO: Christ , Mike . Jesus Christ , Mike .
SANDRA: You 're going to talk to him now .
HAGEN: Yes .
SANDRA: Will you tell him ?
HAGEN: I do n't know . She stops him .
SANDRA: Tom , think of yourself for once . Do n't let this opportunity slip through your fingers ; do n't do it . We 're all trapped here , do n't you see ?
MICHAEL: Sit down , Tom . Have you heard about our friend and partner , Mr. Hyman Roth ?
HAGEN: I know he 's in Israel .
NERI: The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew . ' His passport 's been invalidated except for return to the U.S . He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday , offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship . They turned him down .
HAGEN: He 's going to try Panama
MICHAEL: They wo n't take him ; not for a million , not for ten million .
HAGEN: His medical condition is reported as & quot ; terminal. & quot ;
MICHAEL: He 's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years .
HAGEN: That plane goes to Miami
MICHAEL: I want it met .
HAGEN: Mike , it 's impossible . He 'll be met by the Internal Revenue ; the Customs Service , and half the FBI .
MICHAEL: I do n't like it when you use the word impossible ; nothing is impossible
HAGEN: Mike , it would be like trying to kill the President ; there 's no way we can get to him .
MICHAEL: I 'm surprised at you , Tom . If there 's anything certain ; certain in life ; if history has taught us anything , it 's that you can kill ANYBODY . But perhaps you elucatance is because you 've come to tell me that you 're moving you family to Vegas , that you 've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there . Or were n't you going to tell me at all ?
HAGEN: Are you so hungry for traitors ; do you want to find them everywhere ?
MICHAEL: They are everywhere !
HAGEN: I turned Houstan down ; I did n't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down . Are you sure , Mikey ? Are you sure of what we 're doing ; what we 'll gain ; what does the family gain ? Forget that , Mike ; I already know the answer .
MICHAEL: I know you do , Tom . Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do . If not , call Houstan , and become a Vice-President . Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas .
HAGEN: Why do you hurt me , Michael ? I 've always been loyal to you .
MICHAEL: Good . Then you 're staying .
HAGEN: I 'm staying . Do n't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this ; Sonny never listened to me about that . Now , explain everything to me .
FREDO: Anthony , ole buddy , your Uncle Fredo 's gon na teach you how to catch the big fish . You know , when I was a kid , I did this amazing thing . I went out on a fishing trip ; me and my brothers and my Pop , and no one could catch a fish except me . And this was my secret Every time I would put the line down I would say a & quot ; Hail Mary & quot ; and every time I said a & quot ; Hail Mary & quot ; I would catch a fish . Now , when it 's sunset , we 're gon na go out on the lake , and we 're gon na try it .
HAGEN: I think I prefer to see my client privately .
PENTANGELI: The room has a bug in it .
HAGEN: I 'd like to go outside with him , in the open air .
PENTANGELI: Did my brother go back ?
HAGEN: Yeah , but do n't worry .
PENTANGELI: He 's ten times tougher than me , my other . He 's old-fashioned .
HAGEN: Yeah . He would n't even go out to dinner . Just wanted to go home .
PENTANGELI: That 's my brother . Nothing could get him away from that two mule town . He coulda been big ove here he could of had his own Family .
HAGEN: You 're right .
PENTANGELI: Tom , what do I do now ?
HAGEN: Frankie , you were always interested in politics , in history . I remembe you talking about Hitler back in '43 . We were young then .
PENTANGELI: Yeah , I still read a lot . They ing me stuff .
HAGEN: You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should e organized , how they based it on the old Roman Legions , and called them 'Regimes ' with the 'Capos ' and 'Soldiers , ' and it worked .
PENTANGELI: Yeah , it worked . Those were great old days . We was like the Roman Empire . The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire .
HAGEN: Yeah , it was once .
PENTANGELI: Yeah , but only the rich guys . The little guys got knocked off . If they got arrested and executed , all their estate went to the Emperor . If they just went home and killed themselves , up front , nothing happened .
HAGEN: Yeah , that was a good break . A nice deal . Pentangeli looks at Hagen ; he understands .
PENTANGELI: They went home and sat in a hot ath and opened their veins , and led to death . Sometimes they gave a little party before they did it .
HAGEN: Do n't worry about anything , Frankie Five-Angels .
PENTANGELI: Thanks , Tom . Thanks .
FREDO: Here we go ; and remember the secret . He lifts Anthony into the boat .
FREDO: He 's here ; we 're goin ' fishing .
CONNIE: He ca n't go ; Michael wants to take him into Reno .
FREDO: Ah . Okay , kid , you got to go to Reno with your Pop .
CONNIE: Hurry , Anthony .
FREDO: the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus .
FREDO: Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us
FBI MAN: Mr. Roth , we have to take you into custody .
ROTH: Yes , I know . Some flashbulbs go off .
REPORTER: Can you give us your reaction to the High Court of Israel 's ruling .
ROTH: I am a retired investor on a pension , and I wished to live there as a Jew in the twilight of my life
LAWYER: Mr. Roth is not a well man ; he 's tired of running .
ROTH: I 'm an old man ; at my age , it 's too late to start worrying .
REPORTER: Is it true you are worth over three hundred million dollars , Mr. Roth ?
ROTH: I 'm a retired investor , living on a pension I came home to vote in the Presidential election , because they would n't give me an absentee allot
CONNIE: Kay , you have to go .
KAY: Anthony , kiss Mama goodbye . He does n't move .
CONNIE: Anthony , you kiss your Mothe goodbye !
KAY: Anthony , say goodbye ; your Mama loves you .
ANTHONY: Goodbye .
KAY: Anthony , kiss me once . Then she looks up , and slowly rises .
CONNIE: Do n't worry ; I 'm sure he got here on time . The roads from the airport are so windy , it takes forever ; I 've driven them myself .
ANTHONY: Hello , Dad .
MICHAEL: Anthony .
ANTHONY: I was taller than you when I was fourteen .
MICHAEL: Sit down . Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch , ut now it 's all dried out .
ANTHONY: I 'm not hungry .
MICHAEL: Well , that 's alright alright . Good . You 'll graduate in anothe year , is n't that right ? You know I never finished college . I was a good student , but I never finished . Of course , there was a war then . Connie approaches them .
CONNIE: Do n't let me interrupt anything , this will just take a second . Here . Your father has to have his insulin shot . Why do n't you go to you oom and put your things away , Anthony . She begins to give Michael the shot .
MICHAEL: Hurry back ; we 'll talk . We 'll talk .
CONNIE: Whenever I see that lake so cold , I think of poor Fredo , drowned . Lake Tahoe is very cold . They say if a person drowns in it , that the body will remain mid-suspended perfectly preserved . Some say it will remain forever . She finishes the shot , puts her things away .
SONNY: Hey , who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi . Here my brother Fredo , here 's my Mom . Mom , whatcha got cooking ? And Carlo , this is my kid siste Connie . Here , pull up a chair , Carol is sitting next to Connie . Oh , the droopy kid over there is Mike . The college boy .

SONNY: Kid , stay in college . The girls are cuter , if you know what I mean .
HAGEN: Pop had to pull a lot of strings to get you your deferment .

MOREHOUSE: And what makes you think T. give a shit about what happens to the Admin- istration ?

KAY: Oh no , I want to hear everything . You made twenty pictures in all
WHALE: Twenty-one . The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking . The horror pictures were trifles . Grand guignol for the masses .
KAY: But it 's the horror movies you 'll e remembered for .
WHALE: I am not dead yet , Mr. Kay .
KAY: No . I never said you were . O will be soon .
WHALE: I have a proposal , Mr. Kay . This mode of questioning is getting old , do n't you think ?
KAY: I do n't mind .
WHALE: Let 's make it more interesting . I will answer any question you ask . But , for each answer , you must emove one article of clothing . Kay 's mouth pops open .
KAY: That 's funny , Mr. Whale .
WHALE: It is , is n't it ? My life as a game of strip poker . Shall we play ?
KAY: You 're serious .
WHALE: Quite .
KAY: Then the rumors are true ?
WHALE: What rumors might those be ?
KAY: That you were forced to retire ecause , uh a sex scandal .
WHALE: A homosexual scandal , you mean ? For me to answer a question of that magnitude , you 'll have to remove oth your shoes and your socks . Kay just sits there , squinting and grinning .
KAY: You 're a dirty old man .
WHALE: You are kind to indulge your elders in their vices . As I indulge the young in theirs .
KAY: Too warm for a sweater , anyway .
WHALE: You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago . Nobody cared a tinker 's cuss who slept with whom , so long as you kept it out of the papers . Outside of Hollywood , who knows who George Cukor is , much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica ? Kay stares at him in disbelief .
KAY: George Cukor ? Who made `` A Star Is Born '' ? I never guessed .
WHALE: Take off your vest and I 'll tell you a story .
KAY: I guess .
WHALE: George is famous for his Saturday dinner parties . Great artists , writers , society folk , all rubbing elbows with Hollywood royalty . But how many of those oh-so-prope people know about the Sunday unches that follow ? Gatherings of trade eating leftovers , followed y some strenuous fun and frolic in the pool . If a goat like that can continue about his business , my more domestic arrangements could 've aised very few eyebrows .
KAY: Can we talk about the horror movies now ?
WHALE: Certainly , Mr. Kay . Is there anything in particular you want to know ?
KAY: Will you tell me everything you emember about making `` Frankenstein '' ?
WHALE: Of course .
KAY: I ca n't believe I 'm doing this .
WHALE: Maybe you 'd like a swim when we 're through . I never swim myself , so the pool tends to go to waste .
KAY: Okay . `` Frankenstein . '' Tell me everything .
WHALE: Righto . Let me see .
KAY: Who came up with the Monster 's makeup and look ?
WHALE: My idea . Muchly . My sketches . Big heavy brow . Head flat on top so they could take out the old ain and put in the new , like tinned beef .
KAY: He 's one of the great images of the twentieth century . As important as the Mona Lisa .
WHALE: You think so ? That 's very kind
KAY: Boris Karloff . Where did you find him ?
WHALE: Please . Excuse me . I must go lie
KAY: Mr. Whale ? Are you all right ?
WHALE: I just need to lie down . Studio . Daybed in studio .
KAY: Oh my God . What 's wrong , Mr. Whale ? Is it your heart ?
WHALE: Head . Not heart .
HANNA: Water . Glasses at the sink .
WHALE: Luminal .
KAY: I was going to take a swim .
WHALE: I 'm sorry I spoiled it for you . You should probably go home .
KAY: Right .
WHALE: You must think I 'm terrible , Hanna .
HANNA: I do not think you anything anymore . Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys .
WHALE: Oh shut up . All we did was talk . My attack had nothing to do with him .
HANNA: Perhaps we should get you uphill efore the pills knock you cold .
WHALE: No . Let me lie here . Thank you .
CLAY: Fuck off !
DWIGHT: Hasta la vista , Boone . And give the jail bait a squeeze for me .
CLAY: Hey , umRose
DAISY: Daisy .
CLAY: Huh ?
DAISY: My name is Daisy .
CLAY: Time to go , Daisy . She presses her naked body against Clay 's .
DAISY: You know . I could help you fix up this place real nice .
CLAY: Do n't you have to be somewhere ? Like high school maybe .
DAISY: I gave it up for Lent . Daisy smiles at her own joke . Clay frowns .
CLAY: Right . Time to hit the road , kid .
WHALE: Everything alright , Mr. Boone ?
CLAY: Just got away from me . Sorry to disturb you .
WHALE: I was just about to ask Hanna to ing down iced tea . I 'd like it very much if you 'd join me .
CLAY: I stink to high heaven right now .
WHALE: The honest sweat of one 's brow . I assure you I wo n't be offended . Let me tell Hanna to bring tea fo two .
CLAY: No . Iced tea 's fine .
WHALE: Splendid .
CLAY: These are your paintings ?
WHALE: What ? Oh yes .
CLAY: Excuse me , but are you famous ?
WHALE: You know what they say . If you have to ask
CLAY: I 'm just a hick who cuts lawns . But some of these look familiar .
WHALE: They were familiar when I painted them . That one 's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago . And that 's a Rembrandt .
CLAY: They 're just copies then . Gotcha .
WHALE: But before I retired , you might say I had a brief time in the sun . Fame , as it were . Tell me , do you like motion pictures ?
CLAY: Sure , everybody does . When I was a kid I 'd go with my sister twice a week . Why ? Were you an acto or something ?
WHALE: In my youth , yes , but never in Hollywood . No , I was merely a director here .
CLAY: Yeah ? What were some of you movies ?
WHALE: This and that . The only ones you maybe have heard of are the `` Frankenstein '' pictures .
CLAY: Really ?
WHALE: I made only the first two . The others were done by hacks .
CLAY: Still . You must be rich . Making a couple of famous movies like those .
WHALE: Merely comfortable . Here 's Hanna with our refreshments . Can you get the door ?
HANNA: How are you feeling , Mr. Jimmy ? How is your mind today ?
WHALE: My mind 's lovely . And yours ? Hanna flares her nostrils at him .
HANNA: You remember what the doctor tells us .
WHALE: Yes , yes , yes . I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea . We 'll have a brief chat and he 'll finish the yard .
HANNA: I am not forgetting your last brief chat .
WHALE: Just go . We can manage without you . Hanna stares up at Clay .
HANNA: He looks plenty big . You wo n't need my help if anything goes flooey .
WHALE: Go .
CLAY: What did she mean by going flooey ?
WHALE: I returned recently from a stay in hospital .
CLAY: What was wrong ?
WHALE: Nothing serious . A touch of stroke .
CLAY: Huh ?
WHALE: To an artistic eye , you understand . Have you ever modeled ?
CLAY: You mean , like posed for pictures ?
WHALE: Sat for an artist . Been sketched .
CLAY: What 's to sketch ?
WHALE: You have the most architectural skull . And your nose . Very expressive .
CLAY: Broke is more like it .
WHALE: But expressively broken . How did it happen ?
CLAY: Football in college .
WHALE: You went to university ?
CLAY: Just a year . I dropped out to join the Marines .
WHALE: Yes . You were a Marine . Whale 's gaze deepens . He laughs lightly .
CLAY: You mean you really want to draw me ?
WHALE: Indeed . I 'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head .
CLAY: But why ?
WHALE: Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him .
CLAY: And it 's just my head you want ? Nothing else ?
WHALE: What are you suggesting ? You 'll charge extra if I include a hand o a bit of shoulder .
CLAY: You do n't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit , right ?
WHALE: I have no interest in your body , Mr. Boone . I can assure you of that .
CLAY: All right then . Sure . I could use the extra dough .
WHALE: Excellent . We 'll have a most interesting time .
DR. PAYNE: This is the area of infarction . By which we mean the portion of brain affected by the stroke .
WHALE: Yes , yes , Dr. Payne . But from the neck up ? What 's my story there ?
DR. PAYNE: That 's what I 'm trying to explain .
WHALE: You 're saying there 's an electrical storm in my head ?
DR. PAYNE: That 's as good a way as any to describe it . I 've seen far worse cases . You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane .
WHALE: But the rest of it ? The killing headaches . The phantom smells . My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once . It 's all nothing more than bad electricity ?
DR. PAYNE: In a manner of speaking . I 've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations , but I 'm sure they 're related .
WHALE: So what do I do ?
DR. PAYNE: Take the Luminal to sleep , o whenever you feel an attack coming on .
WHALE: You seem to be saying that this is n't just a case of resting until I 'm better . That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life .
CLAY: Do n't worry , you already paid me . I 'm here because
HANNA: The Master is waiting for you . She gestures him in , shuts the door .
CLAY: It 's your job , lady , not mine . I 'm here so he can draw my picture .
HANNA: I 'm keeping away . What you are doing is no business of mine .
CLAY: What 're you talking about ?
HANNA: What kind of man are you ? Are you a good man ?
CLAY: Yeah , I 'm a good man . Something make you think I 'm not ?
HANNA: You will not hurt him ?
CLAY: Gim me a break . I 'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures . Is that going to hurt him ?
HANNA: No . No . I am sorry . Forget everything I say . Here . I will take the tray .
CLAY: You do that .
WHALE: Very good , Hanna . Now goodbye .
CLAY: Did you see this ? They 're showing one of your movies tomorrow night .
WHALE: You do n't say ? Which picture ?
CLAY: `` Bride of Frankenstein . ''
WHALE: Hmmm . I much prefer `` Show Boat '' o `` The Invisible Man . '' Shall we egin ?
CLAY: Ready when you are . Whale stares at Clay .
WHALE: That shirt , Mr. Boone .
CLAY: It 's new .
WHALE: I 'm sorry . It 's too white , too distracting . Would it be asking too much for you to take it off ?
CLAY: I 'm not wearing an undershirt .
WHALE: Pish posh , Mr. Boone . I 'm not you Aunt Tilly .
CLAY: But it 's just my face you want to draw .
WHALE: Oh if it 's going to make you uncomfortable Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear .
CLAY: All right already . I 'll take it off . Kind of warm in here anyway . He unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off .
WHALE: Yes . Much better . Here .
CLAY: Take a picture , it lasts longer .
WHALE: That 's exactly what I intend to do .
CLAY: No . I 'm fine .
WHALE: It 's a bit like being at the doctor , is n't it ? You have to emain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you .
CLAY: Sounds like something you feed the dog .
WHALE: It is . Only the poorest families ever ate it . We kept ours in a crockery jar .
CLAY: Your family ate dripping ?
WHALE: Of course not . As I said , only poor people Whale stops . He lets out a bitter laugh .
CLAY: What ?
WHALE: I 've spent most of my life outrunning my past . Now it 's flooding all over me . Clay stares out blankly .
CLAY: We were n't rich . But we were n't poor either .
WHALE: No , you were middle class , like all Americans .
CLAY: I guess you 'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks .
WHALE: In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine . Every Englishman knows his place . And if you forget , there 's always someone to remind you . My family had no doubts about who they were . But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature . I had imagination , cleverness , joy . Where did I get that ? Certainly not from them .
CLAY: I do n't mind . I 'm not crazy about my old man either .
WHALE: Why do n't we break for five minutes ? You probably want to stretch your legs .
CLAY: I liked it . You learn stuff listening to old-timers .
DWIGHT: You ever hear of this Whale fellow ?
HARRY: Ca n't say that I have . Ca n't say I 've heard of a lot of people though .
CLAY: If you do n't believe me , let 's watch this movie . See if his name 's on it . How about it , Harry ? Can I watch my damn movie ?
HARRY: I told you . I do n't turn on the TV except for the fights .
BETTY: A spooky movie . Just what this place needs tonight .
DWIGHT: Could n't make it any deader , doll . Set me up .
BETTY: Sure . Your friend want one ?
DWIGHT: Yeah , one for what's-his-name here .
CLAY: Thanks , doll .
BETTY: I say let loverboy watch his movie . And be grateful Boone 's not cutting Shirley Temple 's lawn .
CLAY: Why is everybody giving me crap tonight ?
DWIGHT: Jesus , Boone . You come in here proud as a peacock because some old coot wants to paint your picture . We 're just bringing you back to earth .
BETTY: Sounds screwy to me . I ca n't imagine a real artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser .
CLAY: This kisser was n't so bad you could n't lay under it a few times .
DWIGHT: Ooooh .
BETTY: I bet this is just some fruit pretending to be famous . So he can get in the big guy 's pants .
DWIGHT: Ooooh .
CLAY: What makes you say that ?
BETTY: Just thinking out loud .
CLAY: Yeah , well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself .
BETTY: All right , then . He 's interested in you for your conversation . We know what a great talker you are .
CLAY: Fuck you .
BETTY: Not anymore you do n't . Doll .
CLAY: We 're watching the movie , Harry . You got that ! We are watching my fucking movie .
HARRY: Calm down , Clay . Just calm down . We 'll watch it .
CLAY: Good . Fine .
BETTY: This looks corny .
CLAY: Go wash glasses if you do n't like it .
DWIGHT: Not bad . Two down and it 's just started .
WHALE: Wonderful old Una . Gobbling like an old turkey hen .
HANNA: Oh , that monster . How could you be working with him ?
WHALE: Do n't be silly , Hanna . He 's a very proper actor . And the dullest fellow imaginable .
BETTY: These old movies are such a hoot . They thought they were being scary , ut they 're just funny .
CLAY: Maybe it 's supposed to be funny .
BETTY: Funny is funny and scary is scary . You do n't mix them .
CLAY: Hey ! Some of us are watching a movie !
SAYLOR: Go ahead . Free country .
HARRY: You 're like a dog with a bone ove this movie , Clay .
CLAY: I just want to watch it , okay ?
HANNA: He is not going to kill the old man ?
WHALE: No , Hanna . My heart is n't that lack .
HARRY: Sick stuff . Necrophilia . I wonde if they knew how sick they were .
CLAY: The Monster 's lonely and he wants a friend , a girlfriend , somebody . What sick about that ?
BETTY: All right ! You do n't want him .
HANNA: She is horrible .
WHALE: She is beautiful .
HANNA: Ugh . I am sorry , Mr. Jimmy , but your movie is not my teacup . Still , I am glad there is a happy ending . The bad people are dead and the good people live .
BETTY: Weird movie . Weird , weird , weird .
CLAY: So what did you think ?
BETTY: Weird .
DWIGHT: I loved it . I want a switch like that in my trailer , so I can blow us to kingdom come when things do n't go my way . He wobbles when he climbs off his stool .
CLAY: I think I 'll hang around .
HARRY: Go home , Clay . We 're closing up .
CLAY: I thought I 'd give you a hand since I kept you open .
HARRY: I 'm next door if you need me .
CLAY: You know what ? I think you guys are all jealous .
BETTY: What 's to be jealous of ?
CLAY: I 've gotten to know someone who 's famous .
BETTY: Not so famous any of us have eve heard of him .
CLAY: If he were that famous , he probably would n't give me the time of day . This way , he 's like my famous person . Yeah , my own personal famous person . Who treats me like I 'm somebody worth talking to . Clay leans down to plug in the jukebox .
BETTY: It means it 's too cold to go swimming . And I do n't mean the water .
CLAY: I was n't going to try anything .
BETTY: Yeah , and I 'm never going to smoke another cigarette .
CLAY: Let 's go for a walk at least . Walk and talk . I really feel like talking tonight . Betty 's eyes blink in mock surprise .
BETTY: Do you realize you 're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me ?
CLAY: It 's different . He 's a man . And y the way you have no business calling him a homo .
BETTY: It never crossed your mind ?
CLAY: He 's an artist . Anyway , he 's too old to think about sex .
BETTY: All the old men I know think about nothing but sex .
CLAY: C'mon . What 's eating you tonight ?
BETTY: You picked up that girl right in front of me .
CLAY: Hey , no strings , right ? That 's what you always said . Just good pals who have the hots for each other .
BETTY: It still hurt . A lot .
CLAY: I did n't mean to
BETTY: No , I 'm actually kind of glad it happened . It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life . Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you .
CLAY: You liked it too .
BETTY: Sure . I loved it .
CLAY: If you enjoy it , you should do it .
BETTY: You know , I just ca n't do that anymore . I still have time to get things right . Get married again
CLAY: You mean us ? Betty bursts out laughing .
BETTY: The look on your face ! You 're not marriage material . You 're not even oyfriend material . You 're a kid . A big , fun , slightly irresponsible kid .
CLAY: I 'm not a kid .
BETTY: What are you then ? What will you e ten years from now ? Still cutting lawns ? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer ?
CLAY: I like my life . I 'm a free man .
BETTY: Sure you 're free , for now at least . But how long before you 're just alone ? Pathetic and alone .
CLAY: So you do n't want to fuck . That 's what you 're telling me ?
BETTY: Is that all this conversation means to you ? Am I going to put out o not ?
CLAY: Damn straight . I 'm sick of playing games .
BETTY: From here on out , Boone , you 're just another tired old face on the other side of the bar .
CLAY: It 's all shit ! Shit on by women ! Shit on by the Marines . Shit on by the world ! Fuck !
HANNA: You will take them all , Mr. Jimmy ?
WHALE: I 'll be fine , Hanna . Thank you .
HANNA: Good night .
ELSA LANCHESTER: You done yet , love ? I am absolutely dying for a fag .
BORIS KARLOFF: Goo ' 'orning , 'ames .
WHALE: Good morning . And a very good morning to you .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Uh-oh . The way you look at me , James . What have you done this time ?
WHALE: Bring a mirror . Let the Bride feast upon her visage .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Boris ? Do I look a fright ?
JACK: Behold , the Bride of Frankenstein .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Oh , James .
WHALE: Nonsense , my dear . You look extraordinary . Today 's script . Quick . And a pencil .
BORIS KARLOFF: I 'ish you 'old ' e 'ooner . The assistant removes his mouthpiece .
ERNEST THESIGER: My God . Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done he hair ? I thought we were mad scientists , not hairdressers .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman .
ERNEST THESIGER: Oh no , my dear . You look absolutely amazing . There 's no way I can compete with you . The scene is yours .
ELSA LANCHESTER: In the sequel , James , two lady scientists should make a monster . And our monster would be Gary Cooper .
ERNEST THESIGER: I would 've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line .
ELSA LANCHESTER: More your line .
ERNEST THESIGER: My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin . Dogs are so much more dependable than men .
WHALE: Colin ? Please . It 's time . How is he today ?
ERNEST THESIGER: Stiff as a board . Yes , Colin . Come see what they 've done to our Elsa . Clive walks over , glumly .
COLIN CLIVE: I 'm not at my best today , Jimmy . A touch of flu , you know .
WHALE: Relax , my boy . You could do this scene in your sleep .
ERNEST THESIGER: I gather we not only did her hai ut dressed her . What a couple of queens we are , Colin .
WHALE: Yes , a couple of flaming queens . And Pretorius is a little in love with Dr. Frankenstein , you know .
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Quiet on the set ! The warning bell rings .
SOUND MAN: Okay for sound .
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Camera !
CAMERA ASSISTANT: Scene two-fifteen . Take one .
WHALE: Action .
ERNEST THESIGER: The Bride of Frankenstein !
WHALE: Luminal . Illumine all .
CLAY: Just go to sleep .
WHALE: I 'm up , Hanna .
CLAY: I told you to sleep .
WHALE: Does the yardman come today ?
HANNA: Of course . This afternoon . A thin smile forms on Whale 's face .
CLAY: Something I can do for you ?
HANNA: The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch . I tell him you will be having other plans , but he insists I ask .
CLAY: Got a lawn this afternoon , but I 'm free until then .
HANNA: Expect nothing fancy .
CLAY: Tea is fine . He sits at the kitchen table .
HANNA: No . You are a guest now . You go in the living room .
CLAY: That 's okay , Hanna . I 'm more comfortable in here . It is Hanna , is n't it ?
HANNA: Long enough . Fifteen years .
CLAY: I bet you 've seen a lot of famous people come and go ? Movie stars ?
HANNA: No . We live simply , Mr. Jimmy and I . People come to play bridge . And now and then , young men to swim . You have people , Boone ?
CLAY: You mean family ? All in Joplin , Missouri .
HANNA: Your wife ?
CLAY: I 'm not married .
HANNA: Why ?
CLAY: Oh , I do n't know . Because no girl in her right mind will have me ?
HANNA: A man who is not married has nothing . He is a man of trouble . You need a woman .
CLAY: You proposing what I think you 're proposing ? Do n't you think I 'm a little young for you ?
HANNA: Men . Always pulling legs . Everything is comedy . `` How very amusing . How marvelously droll . ''
CLAY: You ever been married , Hanna ?
HANNA: Of course . I am married still .
CLAY: Yeah ? What 's your husband do ?
HANNA: He is dead now , twenty years .
CLAY: Then you 're as single as I am .
HANNA: No . I have children , grandchildren too . I visit when I can . But now that Mr. Jimmy can not be left very long , I do not get away much . Poor Mr. Jimmy . There is much good in him , but he will suffer the fires of hell . Very sad .
CLAY: You 're sure of that ?
HANNA: This is what the priests tell me . His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven .
CLAY: Sins of the flesh ? Everybody has those .
HANNA: No . His is the worse . The unspeakable . The deed no man can name without shame ? She loses patience with Clay 's blank look .
CLAY: A homo ?
HANNA: Yes ! You know ? Clay slowly sits up .
CLAY: You 're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo .
HANNA: You did not know ?
CLAY: Wellno , not really
HANNA: You and he are not doing things ?
CLAY: No !
HANNA: Good . That is what I hope . I did not think you a bugger too . I fea only that you might hurt him if he tries .
CLAY: I 'm not going to hurt anyone .
HANNA: Yes . I trust you .
WHALE: How are you , Mr. Boone ? So glad you are free for lunch .
CLAY: All right , I guess .
WHALE: I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor .
CLAY: Go ahead .
WHALE: Hmmm ? Princess Margaret ?
CLAY: This David 's a friend ?
WHALE: Yes . An old , useless friend . You must excuse me , Mr. Boone . This is a world I finished with long ago . I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment . Lunch should be ready . Shall we ?
CLAY: Saw your movie the other night . Watched it with some friends .
WHALE: Did you now ?
CLAY: I liked it . We all did .
WHALE: Did anyone laugh ?
CLAY: No .
WHALE: Pity . People are so earnest nowadays .
CLAY: Why ? Was it supposed to be funny ?
WHALE: Of course . I had to make it interesting for myself , you see . A comedy about death . The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who is n't in on the joke . But the Monster never receives any of my gibes . He is noble . Noble and misunderstood .
CLAY: I do n't like to talk about that .
WHALE: It 's nothing to be ashamed of , in the service of one 's country . That 's something to be proud of .
CLAY: Proud ? Any jerk with a gun can kill someone .
WHALE: Quite true . Hand-to-hand combat is the true test . Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand ?
CLAY: No . I could have , though .
WHALE: Yes , I believe you could . How free is your schedule this afternoon ?
CLAY: Full up . I got the hedges to do here , then another lawn out by La Cienega .
WHALE: What is we say phooey to the hedges ? Could you spare an hou after lunch ? To sit for me ?
CLAY: Ca n't today .
WHALE: I 'll pay our going rate . Plus what you 'd get if you did the hedges .
CLAY: Sorry . I do n't feel like sitting still today .
WHALE: All righty . I understand . Whale tilts a scrutinizing eye at Clay .
CLAY: You ever been married , Mr. Whale ?
WHALE: No . At least not in the legal sense . Clay hands a clipped cigar back to Whale .
CLAY: So you had a wife ?
WHALE: Or a husband . Depending on which of us you asked . My friend David . He lived here for many years .
CLAY: No , I you 're a homosexual .
WHALE: Oh dear . If one must have a clinical name .
CLAY: I 'm not , you know .
WHALE: I never thought you were .
CLAY: You do n't think of me that way , do you ?
WHALE: What way might that be ?
CLAY: You know . Look at me like like I look at women .
WHALE: Do n't be ridiculous . I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him . Besides , you 're not my type . Clay suddenly laughs . Whale 's smile deepens .
CLAY: What you do is no business of mine . Live and let live , I say .
WHALE: I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today ?
CLAY: No . I Whale continues to smile , slyly .
WHALE: What are you afraid of , Mr. Boone ? Certainly not a frail old man like me . Clay has no answer . He gives in with a sigh .
CLAY: Can I see what you did so far ?
WHALE: It will only make you self-conscious . You 'll have to emove your shirt .
CLAY: Sorry . Not today .
WHALE: But we have to match the othe sketch .
CLAY: I just feel more comfortable keeping it on . You just said you did n't want me self-conscious . Whale steps forward .
WHALE: Perhaps if we open the shirt and pull
CLAY: I 'm fine . I 'd just rather keep it on .
WHALE: Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders ? Two buttons . Is that so much to ask ? Just two little buttons .
CLAY: No ! Look . What you told me at lunch is still very weird for me . So either you sketch me like I am or I 'll say forget it and go do your hedges .
WHALE: Of course . I do n't want to scare you off . Not before I 'm finished with you .
CLAY: Not at the moment .
WHALE: Why not ?
CLAY: You know how it is . You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it .
WHALE: Very well put .
CLAY: The world is just one kiss-ass game after another . A man has to make up his own life , alone .
WHALE: Ah . A philosopher .
CLAY: Thoreau with a lawnmower .
WHALE: I like that . But take care , Mr. Boone . Freedom is a drug , much like any other . Too much can be a very bad thing .
CLAY: Is that why you and your friend split up ? Because you wanted to be free ?
WHALE: In a way , yes . I suppose so . I know it 's why I stopped making pictures .
CLAY: What happened ?
WHALE: The fucking studio butchered it . It was 1937 , Hitler 's armies were already massing and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor . Anything to avoid losing the German market . They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick . The picture laid an egg , a great expensive bomb . For which I was lamed .
CLAY: Do you miss it ?
WHALE: It 's so far in the past now . Ove fifteen years
CLAY: You 've done a helluva lot more than most people .
WHALE: Better work .
CLAY: How long were you ?
WHALE: Twenty years . Too long . We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast 's ability to keep it fresh . So I finally decided to close down the show .
CLAY: Cut it out !
WHALE: I assure you , Mr. Boone , I meant no
CLAY: From now on , Mr. Whale , I cut you grass and that 's it . Understand ?
YOUNG MAN: Come on , Jimmy . Watch me dive . Whale offers a melancholy smile .
WHALE: I think I 'll just rest for a moment .
CLAY: You first .
WHALE: Oh no . I never swim .
CLAY: Do you mind turning on a light ? It 's getting pretty soupy out here .
OWNER: Should have been here when you said you would . You whack off a tow , do n't think about taking me to court .
CLAY: You 're lucky I even squeezed you in today .
OWNER: Do n't take that tone with me , bub . There 's Japs in this town that work cheaper and do flowers too .
CLAY: Will you just turn on the porch light ? Sir ? The owner flicks on the light .
HARRY: She took the night off . Heavy date . Some guy she 's had her eye on for a while .
CLAY: Thanks a lot , pal .
DWIGHT: Hey , Boone .
CLAY: Have a drink ?
LIBRARIAN: Here are the trade newspapers you wanted . Clay takes the books , opens one .
WHALE: Who was that at the door ?
HANNA: A visitor .
WHALE: Thank you , Hanna . That will be all .
CLAY: I 'd like to sit for you again . But only if you ease up on the locke oom talk . Okay ?
WHALE: Scout 's honor . Clay smiles .
CLAY: I do n't know . I guess I like you stories .
WHALE: Everybody has stories to tell .
CLAY: Not me .
WHALE: What about your stint in Korea ? I 'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes .
CLAY: I told you . I do n't like to talk about that .
WHALE: And the fear you showed at our last session ? How did you overcome that ?
CLAY: Not fear . More like disgust .
WHALE: Same difference , Mr. Boone . Disgust , fear of the unknown all part of the great gulf that stands etween us . Am I right in assuming that you 've had little experience with men of my persuasion ?
CLAY: There 's no people like you in my crowd .
WHALE: No teammates in football ? No comrades in Korea ?
CLAY: You must think the whole world is queer . Well it 's not . War sure is n't .
WHALE: Oh , there may not be atheists in the foxholes , but there are occasionally lovers .
CLAY: You 're talking through your hat now .
WHALE: Not at all . I was in the foxholes myself .
CLAY: You were a soldier ?
WHALE: I was an officer .
CLAY: This was World War I ?
WHALE: No , my dear . The Crimean War . What do you think ? The Great War . You had a Good War , while we had
CLAY: Something happened to him ? Whale looks up at Clay , stares at him .
WHALE: I remember one morning in particular . A morning when the sun came out .
CLAY: I did n't
WHALE: Why do I tell you this ? I neve told David . I never even emembered it until you got me going .
CLAY: You 're the one who started it .
WHALE: You 're very clever , Mr. Boone . You just sit there and let me talk . What a sorry old man , you 're thinking . What a crazy old poof . Why are you here ? What do you want from me ?
CLAY: You asked me to model . Remember ?
WHALE: Of course I remember . Do you think I 'm so senile
CLAY: Mr. Whale ? Are you okay ?
WHALE: Stupid . Very stupid . What have I een thinking ?
CLAY: I do n't get it . First you creep me out with homo shit . Then you hit me with war stories . And now you 're upset because I listen ? What do you want ?
WHALE: I want I want His pained eyes focus on Clay , and soften .
CLAY: No harm done .
WHALE: It was foolishness to attempt this portrait . You can not force what will not flow .
CLAY: You do n't want me to sit for you anymore ?
WHALE: How would you like to come to a party with me ? A reception fo Princess Margaret .
WHALE: If you do n't mind driving , I 'd like to take you as my guest . There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused .
CLAY: I 'm game . Sure .
WHALE: Very good , Clayton . May I call you Clayton ? Or do you prefer Boone ?
CLAY: Clayton is fine . Whale smiles gently .
HANNA: Mr. Boone . He is an interesting friend .
WHALE: I 'd hardly call our yardman a friend .
HANNA: No . But someone you can talk to . Whale stops , turns to Hanna .
WHALE: Do you miss having someone to talk to , Hanna ?
HANNA: I have my family . Also our Lord Jesus Christ .
WHALE: Of course . How is the old boy these days ?
HANNA: It must be up in your old room . I will look . The phone rings . Hanna hurries to answer it .
WHALE: Gas masks on . Gas masks on .
BARNETT: Do n't mind me , Lieutenant . Save yourself .
HANNA: Oh , Mr. Jimmy . You make a mess of it . Here .
WHALE: I 'll be out this afternoon , emember ? Your family can visit as long as they like .
HANNA: No . I do not cook for them . My daughter 's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food .
WHALE: You can toss this one in the trash . Hanna clamps the lid on the box .
CLAY: Do I look okay ?
WHALE: You look splendid , my boy . Quite splendid .
CLAY: If that 's okay ?
WHALE: Nothing would please me more .
CLAY: I do n't hear anything .
WHALE: Exactly . Cukor was too cheap to hire music . There 's nothing but chin-wag . The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag . Whale scans the crowd .
PRINCESS MARGARET: I had no idea you 'd be here .
WHALE: Fine . Quite fine . And Your Royal Highness ?
PRINCESS MARGARET: Splendid . Now that I know you 're around .
WHALE: Sit ?
PRINCESS MARGARET: I 've changed my hair , you see . Since our last session . Those old snaps look rather dowdy now .
WHALE: Ma'am , the pleasure is all mine . James Whale .
PRINCESS MARGARET: I am such a goose . I mistook you for Cecil Beaton . It 's the hat . You 're wearing one of Cecil 's hats , you know .
WHALE: Hello , George . James Whale . David Lewis 's friend . I once made pictures myself , Ma'am .
GEORGE CUKOR: Yes . Of course . One ca n't throw a ock in this town without hitting one of us old movie directors . Whale feels the sting . He turns to Clay .
WHALE: Ma'am , may I present Mr. Clayton Boone ? Clay steps forward to shake hands .
CLAY: Pleased to meet you .
PRINCESS MARGARET: Quite . I adore gardens .
WHALE: He 's never met a princess . Only queens .
CLAY: What was that about ?
WHALE: Nothing of importance . Just two old men slapping each other with lilies . Shall we have a drink ?
CLAY: Who 's that ?
WHALE: David . The friend I thought was in New York .
CLAY: No . The girl .
WHALE: Girl ? Oh . Elizabeth Taylor .
CLAY: Is that really her ?
WHALE: David produced her last picture .
DAVID: What are you doing here ?
WHALE: Just what I was about to ask you . I thought you were in New York .
DAVID: I was , until last night . Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in fo today 's reception .
CLAY: Clay Boone .
WHALE: Our yardman . Who was kind enough to serve as my escort to George 's little do .
DAVID: Should you be drinking in you condition ?
WHALE: Oh , David , stop being a nanny .
CLAY: I think I 'll go look at Elizabeth Taylor . He hurries off .
WHALE: You should have seen Georgie 's face when he met Clayton .
DAVID: You did n't , Jimmy .
WHALE: I did . But Princess Margaret was a doll . We 're all equals in he eyes . As commoners , I presume .
DAVID: You only embarrass yourself .
WHALE: Oh dear . I 'll never work in this town again ?
DAVID: You know what I mean . You eputation .
WHALE: But I have no reputation . I 'm as free as the air .
DAVID: Well the rest of us are n't . Ca n't you remember that ?
WHALE: No . I never could . You must egret having had the invitation sent . David is looking over Whale 's shoulder .
DAVID: I did n't ask George to invite you .
WHALE: Then who did ?
DAVID: Jimmy , there are people here I need to speak to . You 'll be fine on your own ?
WHALE: Yes . Perfectly .
DAVID: All right , then . I 'll come by tomorrow for breakfast .
KAY: Mr. Whale !
WHALE: Mr.Kay ?
KAY: Bet you thought you 'd never see me again . I did n't know if you 'd be well enough to come to this party .
WHALE: You did n't ?
KAY: I 'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor 's guest list .
WHALE: You , Mr. Kay ? How do you know George Cukor ?
KAY: I interviewed him after I met you . I 'm his social secretary now . Well , assistant to his secretary .
WHALE: I commend you . If you 're going to pursue poofs , go after those who can do favors for you . You waste everybody 's time when you court dinosaurs .
KAY: Do n't think that , Mr. Whale . I love your movies . That 's why I wanted you to come to this . So I could see you with your monsters .
WHALE: My monsters ?
KAY: Do n't go away .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Jimmy . How are you ?
WHALE: Elsa ?
ELSA LANCHESTER: I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago . She said you 'd been under the weather .
WHALE: Oh , nothing out of the ordinary . Growing old .
ELSA LANCHESTER: We 're all getting a bit long in the tooth .
WHALE: But you appear quite fresh , my dear .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Please . You should n't stand on my account .
WHALE: Perfectly all right . But if you 'd like to sit
ELSA LANCHESTER: I 'm fine , Jimmy . I can only stay a few minutes .
WHALE: Of course .
ELSA LANCHESTER: What 's our pesky friend up to now ?
WHALE: Oh dear .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Boris , darling . I did n't know you were here . These public revels are hardly up your alley .
BORIS KARLOFF: I came for the sake of my visiting niece . Alice . And Miranda , my great-niece .
ELSA LANCHESTER: And what do you make of our royal visitant ?
BORIS KARLOFF: Perfectly charming . A real lady .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Of course she 's a lady . What did you expect ? A hussy in tennis shoes ?
KAY: Hey , you ! With the camera ! We got a historical moment here . Come get a picture of it . The man scans the scene for a famous face .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Oh , Karloff . Right .
ELSA LANCHESTER: Do n't you just love being famous ?
PHOTOGRAPHER: Let me get one with Frankenstein holding the kid .
BORIS KARLOFF: So good to see you again , James .
KAY: Catch you before you go , Mr. Whale . I 'll make sure everybody gets sent a print .
ELSA LANCHESTER: We 'll be in touch , Jimmy .
WHALE: Good-bye . So nice to see you
CLAY: You okay ? Whale gazes up at Clay .
WHALE: Tired . A bit tired . Clay nods . Whale smiles at him .
CLAY: Actually , no . I feel a little out of place .
WHALE: Neither of us really belongs here .
CLAY: Must have been funny for you . Seeing your monsters again .
WHALE: Monsters ? The only monsters are here .
CLAY: Oh fuck . And we left the top down . You want to run for it ?
WHALE: Run for what ?
CLAY: Ca n't you see ? It 's raining !
WHALE: Let 's get out of this funk hole
CLAY: You do n't want to wait it out ? Rain should let up soon .
WHALE: We 're not sugar . We wo n't melt .
CLAY: I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia .
WHALE: Catch my death .
CLAY: You all right , Mr. Whale ?
WHALE: Jimmy . Please . Call me Jimmy . Clay smiles , starts to back the car out .
CLAY: Just a night out . Sounds like she ca n't say no to her daughter .
WHALE: Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man ?
CLAY: Good . Let 's get dry .
WHALE: What do you think ? Barnett smiles his approval .
CLAY: Mr. Whale ?
WHALE: He trusts me , you know .
CLAY: Mr. Whale ? Jimmy ?
WHALE: Oh , of course . Clayton . You finished your shower already ?
CLAY: Ten minutes ago . Did n't you hea me calling ?
WHALE: I 'm afraid not . Terribly sorry . I believe I promised you some clothes .
CLAY: No . Definitely not . Clay chuckles . Whale smiles .
WHALE: Very good , Clayton .
CLAY: You do n't have any baggy shorts ? Pajama bottoms ?
WHALE: Sorry . My pajamas are tailored . Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel ? No more immodest than a kilt , you know .
CLAY: Do I have any other choice ?
WHALE: Very sporting of you , Clayton . Clay notices a framed drawing on the desk .
CLAY: Is that ?
WHALE: The only memento I ever kept . My original sketch for the Monster .
CLAY: I thought you 'd given up on my picture .
WHALE: I 'd like to try again . If you 're game .
CLAY: Why not ? Give us something to do while we wait .
WHALE: Tell me something , Clayton . Do you believe in mercy killing ?
CLAY: Never gave it much thought .
WHALE: Come now . I 'm sure you came across such situations in Korea . A wounded comrade , or perhaps one of the enemy ? Someone for whom death would be a blessing .
CLAY: I never went . He takes a deep breath , looks up at Whale .
WHALE: But you said
CLAY: that I was a Marine . Which is true . You filled in the rest .
WHALE: I see . Clay downs his beer , refills the glass .
CLAY: My old man was a Marine . He enlisted the day he turned seventeen .
WHALE: The Great War ?
CLAY: By the time he was ready to ship out , the fighting was over . He missed out .
WHALE: A very lucky thing indeed .
CLAY: That 's not the way he saw it . To him , it was like his life never got started . Nothing else really mattered . Definitely not his family . Whale gazes sympathetically at Clay .
WHALE: Is that why you joined the Marines ? For your father 's sake ?
CLAY: I figured he 'd think , you know it was the next best thing . Hey , I loved it too . A chance to be a part of something important . Something bigger than yourself .
WHALE: What happened ?
CLAY: I did n't have the guts for it . A look of surprise crosses Whale 's face .
WHALE: I 'm very sorry .
CLAY: Them 's the breaks , right ? No wa stories for this pup .
WHALE: That 's where you 're wrong , Clayton . You 've just told one . A very good story indeed .
CLAY: Do you mind ?
WHALE: Not at all . He hands the decanter to Clay .
CLAY: Storm 's getting worse .
WHALE: `` A perfect night for mystery and horror . The air itself is filled with monsters . ''
CLAY: That 's from your movie , right ? `` The only monsters are here . ''
WHALE: I do n't remember that one .
CLAY: James Whale . This afternoon at the party . Whale looks up .
WHALE: I do n't recall . Memories of the war , perhaps .
CLAY: But that was so long ago . It ca n't still bother you .
WHALE: Oh , but it does . Especially in light of the journey I 'm about to make .
CLAY: You 're planning a trip ?
WHALE: Barnett . Barnett on the wire .
CLAY: Your friend ?
WHALE: He caught his one night coming back from the reconnoiter . I would n't take him out , but McGill did . Just to give the lad a taste . They were nearly home when a Maxim gun opened fire .
CLAY: You survived it . It ca n't hurt you now . It 's no good to dig it up .
WHALE: Oh no , my friend . It 's digging itself up . There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it . All my diversions have abandoned me . Parties . Reading . Painting . Work . Love . All gone to me now .
CLAY: You wanted to draw me like a Greek statue . All right , then .
WHALE: So it is going to happen after all .
CLAY: What 'd you say ?
WHALE: No . It wo n't do .
CLAY: What wo n't do ?
WHALE: You are much too human .
CLAY: What did you expect ? Bronze ?
WHALE: Do n't move .
CLAY: Why ?
WHALE: For the artistic effect . The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask . It 's quite striking .
CLAY: I do n't know .
WHALE: Please , Clayton . Just for a minute . Long enough for me to see the effect .
CLAY: It 's from the first World War , is n't it ?
WHALE: There are straps in back .
CLAY: Now what ?
WHALE: What was that ?
CLAY: It 's too tight .
WHALE: Allow me . Whale steps in past the goggles .
CLAY: Just take off the fucking mask !
WHALE: Relax , Clayton . I ca n't hear you . I ca n't hear a word .
CLAY: Get the fuck off ! Whale 's hand squeezes between Clay 's legs .
WHALE: What will you do to get yourself ack ?
CLAY: I 'm not that way . Get it through your fucking head . I do n't want to mess with you .
WHALE: Oh , but you feel good , Clayton .
CLAY: I have n't done a damn thing with you !
WHALE: Oh , but you have . You undressed for me . I kissed you . I even touched your prick . How will you e able to live with yourself ?
CLAY: What the hell do you want from me ? ! Whale tilts his face up for another blow .
WHALE: I want you to kill me .
CLAY: You 're crazy .
WHALE: Exactly , I 'm losing my mind . Every day , another piece goes . Soon there will be nothing left . Look at the sketch I made of you .
CLAY: Look , if you want to die do it yourself !
WHALE: No , I do n't want to die alone . But to be killed by you that would make death bearable . They say you never see the one with your name on it . But I want to see death coming at me . I want it to be sharp and hard , with a human face . You face . Think , Clayton . You 'd be my second Monster . Almost as famous as the first . It would be the great adventure you 've yearned for . A war story for both of us to share .
CLAY: I am not your monster .
WHALE: What have I done ? Oh , selfish , selfish fool . I u > have lost my mind . He forces himself to his feet .
CLAY: You okay ?
WHALE: Oh Clayton .
CLAY: Did I hurt you ?
WHALE: Nothing I did n't deserve .
CLAY: Need some help ?
WHALE: Pray you , undo this button . He lifts his chin and points to his collar .
CLAY: All right .
WHALE: When you diebe sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle
CLAY: You 'll feel better tomorrow .
WHALE: Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow Whale smiles fondly at him .
HANNA: Hello ? Oh , Mr. David !
CLAY: It 's not what you think .
HANNA: I have brought you your clothes . All I ask is that you get dressed and go . We are having a guest fo eakfast .
CLAY: I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale .
HANNA: There is nothing you can say that will surprise me .
CLAY: Maybe . But I still need to talk . Do I have time for a cup of coffee efore I go ?
HANNA: I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late . I only hope you did not get him excited . It could give him a new stroke .
CLAY: Thanks . Why do you do it ?
HANNA: What do I do ?
CLAY: Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood .
HANNA: It is my job . I did it when he was happy and it was easy . It is only fair I do it now when he is ill . Enough talk . I must wake up the master .
CLAY: I put him to bed . He 's not there ?
HANNA: Mr. Jimmy ! Mr. Jimmy ! Hanna starts up the stairs .
CLAY: No .
HANNA: Ohhh !
CLAY: I did n't do it . This was n't me .
HANNA: Oh , Mr. Jimmy .
CLAY: He wanted me to kill him , but I did n't . He did it himself .
HANNA: He says here good-bye . I find it in his room . He is sorry , he says . He has had a wonderful life . She waves a folded piece of paper .
CLAY: But I did n't do this !
HANNA: The police will not know that . They will want to investigate .
CLAY: We have his note .
HANNA: Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy ? Please , Clayton . It will be better if I find the body alone .
CLAY: But how 're you going to explain this ? How did you get him out of the pool ?
HANNA: You are right . Yes . We must put him back .
BLIND MAN: Who is it ? You 're welcome , my friend , whoever you are .
MONSTER: Friends .
BLIND MAN: Before you came , I was all alone . It is bad to be alone .
MONSTER: Alone , bad . Friend , good . He takes the old man 's hand .
CLAY: Time for bed , sport . Michael groans , slowly stands .
MICHAEL: Pretty cool . Better than most monster movies .
CLAY: I knew the guy who made it . Michael glances skeptically at his father .
MICHAEL: Come on , Dad . Is this another one of your stories ?
CLAY: Here .
MICHAEL: This is for real ?
DANA: The trash , Clay . Before it rains .
CLAY: Okay . Clay kisses the top of his son 's head .
SKIPPER: Captain . This is the bridge . We have an emergency .
COOK: What 's going on ? What 's happening ?
CAPTAIN: What was that ! ?
SKIPPER: I ca n't tell
CAPTAIN: Abandon ship ! Abandon ship ! Man the lifeboats
NICK: I 'm singing in the rain , just singing in the rain
TERRINGTON: The worm guy , right ? Kyle Terrington , U.S. State Department .
NICK: What are they doing ?
TERRINGTON: You 've been reassigned .
NICK: You ca n't shut me down now ! My esearch here 's not finished !
TERRINGTON: It is now .
BRIEFING OFFICER: The Japanese consulate has been calling and we 've been getting pressure from the Americans .
RAYMOND: What did you tell them ?
BRIEFING OFFICER: Nothing yet .
RAYMOND: Are there any other survivors ?
BRIEFING OFFICER: Only one , Sir . He was very lucky .
RAYMOND: Get them out of there .
BRIEFING OFFICER: It 's no use . He 's been like this since we fished him out of the ocean . Whatever happened to that tanker put him in a complete state of shock .
RAYMOND: What did you see , old man ? Drawn out of himself by the flame
OLD COOK: GojiraGojira
SECOND OFFICIAL: I have no idea what he is saying .
OLD COOK: Gojira ! Gojira ! GOJIRA ! !
MAJOR HICKS: Dr. Niko Topopolosis ?
NICK: It 's Tatopoulos .
MAJOR HICKS: Right . The worm guy . Can someone get those people off the each ?
NICK: Excuse me , would you mind telling me what the hell I 'm doing here ?
MAJOR HICKS: Follow me .
NICK: You did n't answer my question . In fact , for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions .
MAJOR HICKS: We have a situation on our hands that equires your particular expertise .
NICK: Look , I may work for the Nuclea Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field .
MAJOR HICKS: We know .
NICK: Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm ?
MAJOR HICKS: Yeah , you 're the worm guy .
NICK: The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm 's DNA ! You have any idea what that means ?
MAJOR HICKS: No , but I have the feeling I 'm about to find out .
NICK: It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before . Mutated by seventeen percent ? Major Hicks stops , turns to Nick .
MAJOR HICKS: Seventeen percent , huh ? Sounds big .
NICK: They 're enormous ! A new species created by man 's recklessness . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you , I 'm only a biologist . I take radioactive samples and study them .
MAJOR HICKS: Then you 're perfect . Here 's your radioactive sample . Study it . With that Major Hicks walks away .
NICK: What sample ?
MAJOR HICKS: You 're standing on it . Nick looks down , sees nothing .
NICK: I do n't see it . Where is it ?
MAJOR HICKS: That 's right .
NICK: But there 's no animal in the world that can make prints like that ? Is there ?
MAJOR HICKS: We 're hoping you 're going to help us figure that out .
NICK: Somebody must have seen it .
MAJOR HICKS: It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over .
PETERS: Tape 's in . The French finally released it .
MAJOR HICKS: A tanker was attacked and sunk yesterday near the French Polynesians . We think there 's a connection .
NICK: Hi . Nick Tatopoulos
ELSIE: Ah , Elsie Chapman , paleontologist .
DR. CRAVEN: Nice to meet you .
OLD COOK: GojiraGojiraGojira
ELSIE: What could have possibly done all that ?
REPORTER: American and Panamanian troops quarantined off a section of the Panamanian jungle today amid unconfirmed reports of a crashed Ai Force jet
AUDREY: And I 'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman 's expense p.o . 's .
LUCY: Speak of the devil . Just then Caiman passes behind them .
AUDREY: Think I should ask him ? I 'm going to ask him . You think I should ? I will .
LUCY: Oh girl
AUDREY: Did you talk with Humphries ?
CAIMAN: This is not the place
AUDREY: Just tell me , did you talk with him ?
CAIMAN: He said he 'd consider it . It 's between you and Rodriguez .
AUDREY: Are you serious ? He 's going to consider me for he job ? What else did he say ?
CAIMAN: Why do n't I tell you over dinne tonight ? Your place . He stops at his door . Audrey is startled .
AUDREY: Mr. Caiman , you 're married .
CAIMAN: And you 're beautiful
AUDREY: Mr. Caiman
CAIMAN: Call me Charlie .
AUDREY: Mr. Caiman , I 've been doing extra esearch for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year . And I 've never asked for anything but this jo is really important to me . I 'm too old to be an assistant anymore . I need to know this job is going someplace .
CAIMAN: So have dinner with me tonight .
AUDREY: I ca n't .
CAIMAN: It 's your choice .
ELSIE: Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl ? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it ?
NICK: Oh , I 'm not married .
ELSIE: Really ? A girlfriend then ?
NICK: No . Perhaps I work too much .
ELSIE: You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in you heart ? Nick seems to get lost in thought .
NICK: Not for a long time , now .
ELSIE: Well , I think you 're cute .
NICK: Oh , thank you . Is she always like this ?
CLIVE: I had to beat her off with a stick . The sound of a HELICOPTER ZOOMS overhead .
MAJOR HICKS: Who are they ? Lieutenant , get those people away from there .
RAYMOND: They are with me !
MAJOR HICKS: And who are you ?
RAYMOND: CHARGEURES , property and casualty insurance . We are preparing a report .
MAJOR HICKS: You 're fast .
RAYMOND: That is our job .
MAJOR HICKS: Well your people are getting in the way of my job .
RAYMOND: Major , what do you think could have done this ?
MAJOR HICKS: Get your people out of there or I will .
NICK: Mind if I borrow this ?
PETERS: You okay , Nick ?
NICK: Yeah , I'mwaitI lost
RAYMOND: Are you looking for this ?
NICK: Thanks .
LEONARD: Jerry , why are we slowing down ?
DECK HAND: The nets are full !
JULES: Then bring 'em in !
DECK HAND: We ca n't . She wo n't budge !
ARTHUR: What is going on ?
LEONARD: She 's going sternway !
FIRST MATE: What the hell did we catch ?
JULES: Cut us free ! Cut the nets !
ARTHUR: Cut the damned cables !
SOLDIER: Major , we just got a report of a fishing trawler going down . Exact position , forty seven degrees latitude , 67 longitude .
MAJOR HICKS: What makes you think it 's related ?
SOLDIER: The trawler was pulled under .
MAJOR HICKS: Jesus Christ ! It 's only two hundred miles off the American Eastern seaboard and we do n't even know what it is .
ELSIE: Theropoda Allosaurus . Some type of enormous reptile the likes of which we have n't seen since the age of prehistoric dinosaurs .
CLIVE: So where 's been hiding the last sixtymillion years ?
ELSIE: The depth and breath of the ocean floor has barely been explored . His kind could have survived there completely undetected .
NICK: The radiation is not an anomaly , it 's the clue . This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur .
MAJOR HICKS: Do n't tell me why it 's not , tell me what the hell it is .
NICK: What do we know ? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific . An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years .
ELSIE: Hence the radiation .
NICK: More than that . I believe this is a mutated aberration , a hybrid from the fall out in that region .
CLIVE: Like your earthworms ?
NICK: Yes ! We 're looking at a completely incipient creature . The dawn of a new species . The first of its kind .
AUDREY: My life sucks .
LUCY: Oh , please , your life does n't suck . u > His life sucks .
ANIMAL: That 's cuz I 'm married to you .
LUCY: Shut up . How can you eat like that ?
ANIMAL: Big bites .
AUDREY: I ca n't believe he put the moves on me . After everything I 've done fo him .
LUCY: He 's scum ! As far as he 's concerned you 're just a pair of breasts that talk .

LUCY: Did Romeo have a name ?
AUDREY: Nick Tatopoulos .
ANIMAL: That why you dumped him ?
AUDREY: No ! I just could n't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches . I wanted to have some adventure , some fun

NICK: I do n't think so .
MAJOR HICKS: Status report ?
SERGEANT: We 've lost sight of it , Sir .
MAJOR HICKS: You want to run that by me again ?
SERGEANT: After the initial attack he justdisappeared .
OFFICER: Major , Secretary of Defense Burk on the line .
NICK: I do n't understand . How can something that large just disappear ?
SERGEANT: We 're not sure . We 're scanning the area now .
ELSIE: He probably returned to the river . Just like everywhere else we 've been , we 're always one step behind .
NICK: I do n't think so .
SOLDIER: Channel eight caught it on film !
CAIMAN: WNEW 's exclusive images of the creature were taken less than a half hour ago .
AUDREY: Great stuff , Animal . Were n't you scared ?
ANIMAL: Sure I was . I thought Lucy was gon na kill me .
LUCY: Damned right , you crazy Wop !

MAN: What are we running from ? A big lizard ? I 've got cockroaches in my uilding that could kick the crap out of it .
MAYOR: If we 're wrong on this evacuation they 'll string me up from the Liberty torch .
MAYOR: Who the hell are they ?
AIDE: It 's a contingent of building owners and community business epresentatives .
MAYOR: I do n't have time for this nonsense .
AIDE: Most of them are campaign contributors . Well that 's a different story .
MAYOR: I share your concerns . I want to get the city back in business as soon as possible .
MAYOR: If you 'll excuse me
RAYMOND: We are very happy that you are in control of this situation .
MAYOR: Oh , well , thank you very much .
CAIMAN: Hurry , we 're going to miss the Mayor .
POLICE OFFICER: Sorry , you got ta have a press ID past this point .
CAIMAN: Do n't you watch t.v . ?
POLICE OFFICER: Can we see your press pass , sir ?
CAIMAN: I had one here on my bag . Where the hell did I put it ?
LUCY: What the hell are you doing ?
AUDREY: Remember my friend we saw on t.v . ?
LUCY: Your old sweetheart ?
AUDREY: Yeah , well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post . Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama . There 's a story here . I know it . You got any tape or glue ?
LUCY: I left my forgery kit back at the office .
AUDREY: Hey , do you have any glue in you ag ?
KID: What 's it to you ?

AUDREY: Wish me luck !
LUCY: Audrey , I do n't think this is a very good idea . Caiman finds out and he 'll have your job .
AUDREY: I 'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity , Luce . If there 's a story here I 'm going to find it .
RAYMOND: Merci .
MAN: I call this America .
MAYOR: Do you realize what this evacuation will cost the people of this city ! ?
ADMIRAL PHELPS: We 're been monitoring the waters around the island . As far as we can tell it has n't left the area .
MAYOR: But you do n't know for sure .
MAJOR HICKS: We think there 's a strong reason to elieve it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area .
MAYOR: But you do n't know for sure !
MAJOR: Mr. Mayor , if he 's not in one of those uildings then we give the all clear . But not until we 've checked each uilding !
SERGEANT O'NEAL: Sir , that may be more difficult than we originally projected .
MAJOR: More good news ? !
SERGEANT O'NEAL: We 've run into a problem .
LT. ANDERSON: We were checking the office building above when we discovered the floor was gone .
MAJOR HICKS: Christ . How many tunnels lead off the island ?
LT. ANDERSON: Only five , Sir . We 've checked them all . He has n't used any of them .
MAJOR HICKS: Have them sealed off .
LT. ANDERSON: And how should we do that , Sir ?
MAJOR HICKS: Fill them with cement , brick them up , put land mines in them , bombs , I do n't know , just make sure that goddamned thing does n't leave the island !
NICK: You know , he 's not an enemy trying to evade you . He 's just an animal .
MAJOR HICKS: What are you suggesting ?
NICK: When I needed to catch earthworms , I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them . I had to draw them out .
MAJOR HICKS: Where are they now ?
RADIO TECHNICIAN: Delta niner , what is convoy position ?
MAYOR: They find anything yet ?
REPAIRMAN: It is good .
RAYMOND: You said this was French Roast !
SERGEANT O'NEAL: I sure hope your plan works .
NICK: I 'm kind of hoping the same thing .
AIDE: Tres bizarre .
RAYMOND: No . Very clever .
NICK: That 's a lot of fish .
NICK: I need your radio .
SERGEANT O'NEAL: Get some men down into those ai vents . Shut 'em down !
NICK: We need to open all the manhole covers in the area . Let the scent waft down .
MAJOR HICKS: Commence phase one . Let 's gas it !
SERGEANT O'NEAL: Let 'em fly !
YOUNG OFFICER: Where 're you going ? Nick !
MAJOR HICKS: Fire at will !
SERGEANT O'NEAL: Fire at will . Fire at will .
MAJOR HICKS: O'Neal , what the hell is going on there ! ?
SERGEANT O'NEAL: He 's gone , Sir . Echo division 's in pursuit .
LOOTER #1: Jimmy , let 's go .
LOOTER #2: Wait . I want this . Help me !
MAJOR HICKS: Then FIRE damn it !
HELICOPTER PILOT: That is a negative impact .
MAYOR: Negative impact ! ? ! It 's the goddamned Chrysler building , that 's what it is ! His aides try to calm him .
MAJOR HICKS: You said he was locked on !
PILOT: I think we got him .
MAJOR HICKS: Echo four , where is he ! ?
MAYOR: What the hell is the matter with you people ? ! You caused more damage than that thing did !
SERGEANT O'NEAL: I ca n't believe it . He did all this and we did nothing to him . Nick walks over to him , consoling .
NICK: That 's not true . We fed him .
ANCHOR: While it may have looked like Beirut , it was in fact , Manhattan where man and nature have collided with brute force .
REPORTER #1: rumors continue to mount as to the origin of this , perhaps , lost dinosaur
REPORTER #2: having shut down the United Nations in the evacuation , foreign diplomats are demanding an international coalition be assembled to track the creature
CAIMAN: Maintaining a total media blackout , officials remain silent this evening as to their progress in containing this creature
NICK: It 's okay , I 'll get out here .
PHARMACIST: Can I help you , young man ?
NICK: Do you have any home pregnancy tests ? Especially ones that test fo catastrophic hormones or clomiphene citrate .
PHARMACIST: This is all we 've got .
NICK: I 'll take them all .
AUDREY: It 's good to see you , Nick .
NICK: So you made it .
AUDREY: What ?
NICK: You 're a reporter . That 's what you always wanted to be , right ? I 'm happy for you . Really , I am .
AUDREY: Yeah , well
NICK: No , I 'm into earthworms now . You would n't be interested . They 're real `` boring '' creatures . Very reliable , dependable , no surprises
AUDREY: You 're still mad at me , are n't you ?
NICK: You just left me without a phone call , a letter , nothing . All this time . Yeah , I guess I 'm still a little mad .
AUDREY: That was eight years ago . Some people change , you know .
NICK: Most people do n't .
AUDREY: I 'm sorry you feel that way .
NICK: Wait . I 'm sorry . You 're right . Eight years is a long time . Can I offer you a cup of tea ?
AUDREY: Sure . I 'd like that .
NICK: When you and I use to attend rallies in college , we helped to create awareness . But from the inside now I can actually effect change . I never lost my idealism .
AUDREY: And exactly what changes are you trying to effect ?
NICK: I have this theory that we 're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we 've done to nature .
AUDREY: And you think this creature is one of them ?
NICK: Yes . The first of its kind . I found this blood sample earlier this evening
AUDREY: Blood sample ? How close did you get to that thing ?
NICK: I got pretty close .
AUDREY: What else do you know about it ?
NICK: Well , we know he eats fish , he 's of eptile genus , he 's a burrower , he 's amphibious and
AUDREY: Are you sure ?
NICK: Well , obviously these tests were n't designed for this but fundamentally they 're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy .
AUDREY: I do n't get it . If it 's the first of its kind , how can it be pregnant ? Excitedly Nick begins to pace .
NICK: The ultimate expression of evolution , it reproduces asexually . Think about it , all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances fo eproduction . That 's why he came to New York . Like every species of insufficient progenitors , he 's nesting !
AUDREY: Nesting ?
NICK: Yes . Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time ! Nick moves to the front exit of the tent .
COOK: GojiraGojira
NICK: Audrey ? Audrey ?
AUDREY: which is why in this case `` all the kings horses and all the kings men '' may not be able to put the big apple together again . Audrey Timmons , WNEW .
ED: That 's it . You owe me a breakfast .
AUDREY: So , what do you think ?
ANIMAL: It 's good . It 's a real good piece . But how 'd you get a hold of this material ? Audrey covers her own mixed emotions .
AUDREY: Like you said , `` Good guys finish last . ''
MURRAY: Not now , Audrey , we 've about to go live with the morning report .
AUDREY: You 're going to want to include this . I 've got exclusive footage of othe places this thing has attacked .
MURRAY: You do ? Who 's story is this ?
AUDREY: Mine !
MALE VOICE: Major Hicks , what makes you believe another attempt to gun that creature down will work ?
MAJOR HICKS: General Anderson , the problem was the terrain . If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park We should be able to take him down .
MAYOR: Last time you did n't even scratch it !
MAJOR HICKS: That 's not true . Our worm guy , er , I mean , Dr. Tatopoulos found blood .
NICK: Well , yes . I did . Clearly he was injured and bled .
MAJOR HICKS: You see , all we need to do is get a etter shot at it with weapons that do n't rely on heat seeking
NICK: Um , excuse me , sir , but the situation 's more complicated than that . The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has .
GOVERNOR: Are you trying to tell us there 's u > another one of those things out there ?
NICK: I do n't believe so .
MAYOR: Then how can it be pregnant ? What is this , the `` virgin lizard ? '' There 's a smattering of laughter in the room .
NICK: No , it reproduces asexually . That 's why we must find the nest . If we do n't , dozens will be born , each one capable of laying eggs of its own . Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population .
MAJOR HICKS: So after we kill the creature we 'll egin a search for the nest .
NICK: It may be too late by then . These eggs will hatch very quickly .
CLIVE: How could you possible know that ?
NICK: The fish . The fish we found down in the subway . He 's not gathering all that food for himself . He 's preparing to feed his young .
ANIMAL: They just promo-ed your spot . It 's coming on right after this .
MAJOR HICKS: If Dr. Tatopoulos is right , we must act quickly before this problem escalates .
GENERAL ANDERSON: You want to divide our efforts based solely on a wild theory ?
MAJOR HICKS: He 's come through for us before and if he feels strongly
GENERAL ANDERSON: Come through for you ! ? Major , you campaign 's a disaster . You were n't even able to to prevent this thing from coming to Manhattan .
GOVERNOR: Excuse me Gentlemen , but I think we should see this .
GENERAL ANDERSON: How the hell did this get out ?
CAIMAN: From an old Japanese sailor 's song called GODZILLA , a mythological sea dragon who attacked sailors , to ou own modern day terror . Today in my special report , who is this Godzilla , where did he come from and why is he here ?
AUDREY: You 're special report ! I 'm the one that found that stupid song ! That 's my special report , you bastard !
RAYMOND: Allez , allez ! Finally the picture clears .
CAIMAN: a path can be traced back from Manhattan , to Jamaica , back to Panama and all the way back to the French Polynesians where nuclear testing has een going on for over twenty years
GENERAL ANDERSON: You went to the press with this ?
NICK: No , I didn'tI did n't talk with anyone .
GENERAL ANDERSON: They mentioned you by name !
NICK: Yesbut I
MAJOR HICKS: You gave them the tape ?
NICK: No , it 's still in my tent . It'soh my God , she took it . Pissed , GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick .
GENERAL ANDERSON: Pack your stuff . You 're officially off this project as of now .
AUDREY: He stole my report ! That 's my report !
ANIMAL: We know , Audrey .
CAIMAN: and in this reporter 's opinion , `` all the kings horses and all the kings men ''
AUDREY: Caiman you suck !
RAYMOND: We 're leaving .
ELSIE: I 'm sorry about all this .
NICK: Me too . Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave .
ELSIE: I 'll try .
AUDREY: What do you mean Murray 's not there ? A second ago you told me he was on the other line Something catches Audrey 's eye .
CABBY: Where to ?
NICK: Newark airport . Audrey moves up behind Nick .
AUDREY: You 're leaving ? Why ?
NICK: Well what the hell did you think was going to happen ?
AUDREY: You never said it was off the record .
NICK: I should n't have to , Audrey . You 're supposed to be my friend . I trusted you .
AUDREY: I did n't mean for it to turn out like this . Look , I lied to you . I 'm not a eporter . When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I 'd make it . But I have n't . That 's why I needed this story so bad . I just could n't tell you I 'm a failure .
NICK: So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes ?
AUDREY: I 'm sorry .
REPORTER: every shelter in the tri-state area has been overflowing with displaced people . Tent cities have begun to spring up all over the county
WAITER: Can I get you something ? Before Nick can answer
RAYMOND: Pernot , no ice .
NICK: Do I know you ?
RAYMOND: We 've met before .
NICK: Oh yeah , the insurance guy .
RAYMOND: SDECE , Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage . Agent Phillip Raymond .
NICK: Sounds like a big company .
RAYMOND: It 's the French Secret Service .
NICK: Oh .
RAYMOND: We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look fo the creature 's nest .
NICK: Are you sure ? How do you know ?
RAYMOND: We know .
NICK: Why are you telling this to me ?
RAYMOND: I need you to trust me .
NICK: Why do you need that ?
RAYMOND: I need your trust if you 're to help me find the nest .
NICK: Oh , my bags . I 've checked them in .
RAYMOND: We , have already taken care of them .
DISPLACED PERSON: No one tells us a Goddamned thing . My family is getting soaked out here . We have no place else to go . We just want to go back to our home .
ANIMAL: I 'll be right back .
NICK: How did you get all of this stuff into the country ?
RAYMOND: This is America . There is nothing you can not buy . Raymond gives Nick a tour .
NICK: So why all the secrecy ? Why are n't you guys working with the US military ?
RAYMOND: I am not permitted to speak of such things . Nick stops and confronts Raymond .
NICK: You said you wanted my trust , then I need yours . Raymond considers this . Finally
RAYMOND: I am a patriot . I love my country . Can you understand that ?
NICK: Sure .
RAYMOND: It is my job to protect my country . Sometimes I must even protect it from itself . From mistakes we have made . Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about .
NICK: Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific .
RAYMOND: Yes . This testing done by my country left a terrible mess . We are here to clean it up .
NICK: Here . 23rd street subway station . Where we first found the fish . With a little luck , this will lead us right to it .
RAYMOND: So you 're in ?
NICK: Are you kidding ? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion .
ANIMAL: Who the hell are all these people ?
LUCY: What ? I just could n't just let them sleep in the street .
ANIMAL: Where 's Audrey ?
LUCY: In the bedroom . Crying her eyes out ecause of you .
ANIMAL: What ?
LUCY: All that `` you got ta be vicious '' stuff you filled her head with .
ANIMAL: Me ! ? You where the one
LUCY: Go in there . Talk to her . Lucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom .
REPORTERS: Can you comment on the nest ? How many more of these things will there be ?
GENERAL ANDERSON: That 's why I 'm holding this conference . To try and avoid a needless panic .
AUDREY: Stupid idiots !
ANIMAL: You okay ?
AUDREY: It 's all my fault . What have I done , Animal ? What have I become ? Look at me . This is n't me . I do n't do things like this .
ANIMAL: You made a mistake .
AUDREY: Yeah , I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me .
ANIMAL: Did n't you tell me he left for the airport ?
AUDREY: Yeah . Why are you asking ?
ANIMAL: I just saw him . He 's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight .
AUDREY: My God . He 's going after the nest .
ANIMAL: Perfect ! You wanted a story , well , aby , you got one .
AUDREY: Animal , I ca n't .
ANIMAL: Look , you want to make it up to you friend ? Well if he 's right , this is your chance .
AUDREY: I do n't know . I 've already made such a mess of things Animal walks up to the door , ready to exit .
ANIMAL: Audrey , I 'm going after them . You can come with me or not .
AUDREY: What are you doing ?
ANIMAL: Lucy 'd kill me if she knew .
NICK: What 's with the chewing gum ?
RAYMOND: Makes us look more American .
NICK: Just let me do all the talking .
AUDREY: What are you doing ?

RAYMOND: Thank you very much . They drive off . Nick is stunned by the act .
NICK: They 've turned off the ventilation system . They 're calling him to dinner .
RAYMOND: Let 's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres . Nervously they continue onward .
ANIMAL: They 're down there . Let 's go .
AUDREY: Animal , let 's get out of here .
NICK: I guess we go this way . Raymond and his men follow .
MAJOR HICKS: Sergeant , status ?
SERGEANT O'NEAL: Any sign of it ?

RAYMOND: Everyone , outside ! Now !
AUDREY: Great . Now what do we do ?
RAYMOND: We 've got to lock them inside while we can . Raymond tosses his cellular phone to Nick .
NICK: How do I do that ?
RAYMOND: 555-7600 . Tell them it 's a code dragonfly . They should get you through . Amazed by Raymond , Nick just stares at him .
OPERATOR: all circuits are busy right now . Please hang up and try again
MAYOR: Do you have any idea what 's going on out there ? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city .
MAJOR HICKS: We 're sending divers into the rive now to retrieve the body .
MAYOR: That thing 's dead . What the hell are we waiting for ? Just then Elise rushes over to the Major .
ELSIE: Major , if Nick is right , this could be our last chance to do something about it . We have to search for the nest , now .

ANIMAL: Hey ! What gives ?
RAYMOND: No cameras . Nick moves to Audrey 's side , helping her up .
NICK: What are you doing here ?
AUDREY: I thought you said there 'd only be a dozen eggs .
NICK: I was wrong .
RAYMOND: Do you have a radio , a walkie-talkie ? Anything we can use to contact the outside .
AUDREY: What about the phones ?
NICK: Circuits are overloaded .
AUDREY: I know a way . I know how you can get a message out of here .
NICK: How do you know ?
AUDREY: Our network covers the Ranger games .
NICK: Your station wo n't have any easie time contacting the military than I did . That stumps her . Animal gets an idea .
ANIMAL: When you worked with them , did they monitor the news broadcasts ?
NICK: Yes , they did .
ANIMAL: We 'll go live ! We 'll broadcast from here . Hopefully they 'll see it .
CAIMAN: Yes , the threat is over but the pain continues
ED: There 's no Ranger game on tonight .
AUDREY: If you 're seeing this , Ed , please put us on Live ! This is urgent ! I know this sounds crazy Ed but you have to do it . Please , trust me .
ED: I 'm not putting you on live !

CAIMAN: as our fears have been allayed thanks to the dedicated work of ou oys in uniform
AUDREY: Are we on ? Are we live ?
NICK: We 've discovered over two hundred eggs which began hatching only moments ago .
MAJOR HICKS: What is it ?
SOLDIER: You better see this .
NICK: If the military are listening , they must immediately destroy this building efore they can escape .
LUCY: Oh my God ! On the screen the image turns to Nick .
NICK: If those creatures escape and multiply , in a very short time a new species will emerge . One that could eplace us as the dominant species of this planet .
MAJOR HICKS: That 's correct , I want you to blow up Madison Square Garden . No I 'm not drunk . Contact the news station . Tell them we 're on the way .
AUDREY: Reporting live from Madison Square Garden , this is Audrey Timmonds ,
LUCY: That 's my girl .

AUDREY: Really ? I 'd like to find out .
ANIMAL: Hey Man , you all right ?
RAYMOND: I could use a coffee .

PATRICK: Did you know her ?
ANGIE: Vaguely .
PATRICK: Not if you 're channel nine .
ANGIE: That 's Timmy Reilly . Is he a cop now ?
PATRICK: They ca n't be taking that many avenues . The whole force is outside the house .
BOBBY: Hey . How are you ?
PATRICK: Good , Bobby . Nice to see you .
ANGIE: This is why it 's embarrassing to do surveillance three blocks from where we live .
PATRICK: There they go .
ANGIE: Go with him . I 'll follow the mother .
PATRICK: Get out of the way .
KID: Fuck your mother .
PATRICK: Move the Huffy before I slap your face .
KID: Missed me , faggot .

TOMMY: Fuckin ' bullshit . I ca n't go back to my own home to get my own clothes for fea of gettin ' my wages garnished to support Mike Cuddehy ' s fuckin ' kids ?
PATRICK: `` Dorchester ' s best missing persons ? '' That 's terrible .
ANGIE: What 's wrong with it ?
PATRICK: It 's like having world 's tallest midget as your slogan .
ANGIE: It 's better than the old one .
PATRICK: You 're just saying that cause the new one has your name on it .
ANGIE: At a certain point the person who books half the business is entitled to her name on the door .
BEAT: Speaking of which , how 'd you get Tommy ?
PATRICK: These people need to learn how to hide etter . Staying at your girlfriend 's in OC projects ai n't slick .
ANGIE: Keep telling yourself that .
PATRICK: Yo , you want some cereal ?
DOYLE: She is four years old , has blond hair and green eyes , 35 pounds and about 3 and a half feet tall . Amanda 's mother says she put her to bed in her B e a u t y a n d t h e B e a s t nightgown . . . Patrick watches .

PATRICK: Vaguely .
ANGIE: This is horrible .
PATRICK: Not if you 're Channel Nine . She sits down to watch .
DOYLE: We will pursue every avenue .
PATRICK: They ca n't be taking that many avenues . The whole force is outside the house .
NEWSCASTER: Her mother says Amanda may be carrying Mirabelle , her favorite doll . . .
ANGIE: Poor woman .
PATRICK: Look at these guys . Standing around posing for the camera like they have a purpose . That 's why cops hate us .
BEATRICE: My niece is missing .
PATRICK: I heard about that on the news . . .Excuse the mess . We just finished anothe case . . .
ANGIE: I am so sorry , Mrs. McCready . I ca n't imagine what this time must be like fo your family .
PATRICK: This is my associate , Angela Gennaro .
BEATRICE: We want to hire you to augment the police with the investigation . No one says anything .
LIONEL: Like Jean Benet Ramsey . The family hired investigators .
PATRICK: Right . I remember that .
BEATRICE: The Police are nowhere , they 're slow , they keep us in the dark . We want our own investigators .
ANGIE: I 'm not sure we 're who you 're looking for .
BEATRICE: Is n't that what you do ? The ad in the paper said 'missing persons . ' Tiniest of looks from Patrick to Angie .
PATRICK: What Angie is trying to say is we usually get hired to find people who like , take off to New Hampshire without payin ' for their jet ski Bea looks up at Patrick , confused .
ANGIE: Every Police officer in Boston is looking for your niece . This is something they 're qualified for .
BEA: What are you saying ?
ANGIE: I 'm not sure how much help we can be .
PATRICK: Hear her out , Ange .
BEA: You 're not gon na do any harm , are you ? Why is this so hard ? The cops sent one man until I called the Herald and raised Cain . The cops do n't want me hirin ' you . Now you do n't want the job ?
PATRICK: It 's not that we do n't want the job .
BEA: Do n't you know people in the neighborhood ? People who do n't want to talk to Police ?
PATRICK: Yes . We do . Have the Police told you anything so far ?
BEA: If I hear they have `` no leads '' one more time I 'm gon na lose my marbles . I mean , Helene was watching TV next door and was n't gone for more than a half hour .
LIONEL: She was watching `` Wife Swap '' downstairs .
BEAT: It 's her favorite show .
PATRICK: Where 's the father ? Beatrice snorts . Lionel shoots her a look .
LIONEL: Germany . Army base . He does n't want nothin ' to do with Helene .
BEA: Or Amanda . He does n't think she 's his .
PATRICK: Is there anyone you know ? An acquaintance who could have taken her . . . a neighbor ?
LIONEL: I do n't know . You think she was definitely taken though ?
PATRICK: If she were lost I think they . . . Bea may be coming unglued .
BEA: Could n't she have fallen down a well o something ? Like in Texas ?
PATRICK: That 's not what we hope for.. . Awkward moment .
ANGIE: How is Helene holding up ?
LIONEL: She 's trying .
BEA: Please , Lionel .
LIONEL: Look , it . I had my problems , hard bust at 22 . Bea straightened me out . Helene has n't had that .
BEA: No , she has you . You find her work she was our housekeeper for a year and a half-
BEAT: Look , come talk to Helene yourself . I do n't care if you think you can help . Try . There must be something you can do . She looks at them expectantly .
PATRICK: We 'll meet you over there . He throws Angie another small look .
BEA: We do n't have a lot of money , but I saved over the years . Do n't think we ca n't afford it . Angie gives her a smile .
ANGIE: If a missing child is n't found in seventy two hours they are almost neve ecovered .
PATRICK: Pretty quick with the facts for someone who 's so unqualified .
ANGIE: I read that on the computer in two minutes while you were getting dressed .
PATRICK: See that , you 're already on the case .
ANGIE: We are n't needed , we canrt make a difference and we ca n't take their money .
PATRICK: I do n't want to take their money .
ANGIE: I do n't want to find a child in a dumpster .
PATRICK: Neither do I. I want to find one alive who we can bring home .
ANGIE: We have a good life , Patrick .
PATRICK: This wo n't change that .
ANGIE: You go out in the rain , you get wet .
PATRICK: If it 's a four year-old girl out there , you go out and bring her back . We 'll be okay .
SMILES: It 's just rain .
PATRICK: Block party .
OFFICER REILLY: Friends of the family ? Patrick rolls his eyes .
PATRICK: Timrny . It 's me . Lionel is out on the porch .
LIONEL: It 's okay . Come on in .
DOTTIE: I remember you . Angie looks blank .
LIONEL: Could you excuse us , Dottie ?
HELENE: Dottie 's my best friend , Lionel . She can e in my house if she wants .
PATRICK: We just want to ask a few questions .
HELENE: She can be here for that .
TO LIONEL: It 's fine .
TO HELENE: Now everyone wants to be part of it .
HELENE: I know .
TO ANGIE: I already talked to the cops forty times .
ANGIE: We 're sorry to take up your time .
PATRICK: Beatrice asked us to come here .
HELENE: - W h y do n't Bea mind her business . It 's
DOTTIE: 'Cause everyone 's tryin ' to get thei moment now .
LIONEL: Bea hired these people to help find Amanda with her own money . You bette show them the God damn courtesy they deserve !
DOTTIE: She 's in grief , prick .
LIONEL: She can grieve how she wants , Dottie . You do n't live here .
HELENE: Do n't yell at her . You ai n't her father !
DOTTIE: Fuck you , Lionel .
LIONEL: I 'm sorry .
ANGIE: Maybe we should go .
LIONEL: I 'm sorry . . . I understand .
PATRICK: Can you excuse us , Helene ? Helene ignores her .
LIONEL: Helene has emotional problems .
BEATRICE: It 's not that , Lionel .
LIONEL: What is it , then ? What Bea says belies her matronly kindness .
BEATRICE: She 's a cunt .
LIONEL: Beatrice ! Do n't say that word .
BEATRICE: God help me , it 's true .
LIONEL: For God 's sake , the walls are thin .
BEATRICE: I do n't care anymore , Lionel . Let he hear . Bea hands Patrick the photograph of Amanda .
COMFORTING SMILE: Well . We ca n't do any harm , right ?
PATRICK: What about who she hangs out with ? What kind of people are around ?
LIONEL: I do n't know . She 's at the Fillmore all the time .
PATRICK: The Fillmore Lounge ?
LIONEL: She drinks every day , she 's got the gene . The disease . Our parents had it , too .
PATRICK: She use drugs ?
LIONEL: I think she does a little coke .
PATRICK: How much is a little ?
LIONEL: I do n't know . . . few times a week , maybe . How much is a lot ?
PATRICK: Few times a week is a lot .
LIONEL: Then she does a lot . I do n't know anything about that .
TO PATRICK: I put the plug in the jug , myself . I got twenty three years sobriety . There is a short beat before
PATRICK: f o r lack of anything else ) Good for you .
ANGIE: What 's Amanda like ?
BEATRICE: She 's quiet . Has her manners , please and thank yous . She tries her hardest to be good .
ANGIE: You mind if we look in her room ?
PATRICK: We get a bonus for finding the furniture ?
ANGIE: Maybe she ran away .

DOYLE: Jack Doyle .
REACHING OUT: Patrick Kenzie . Angela Gennaro .
DOYLE: Nice to meet you .
ANGIE: Good to meet you , Captain
DOYLE: I take it Bea hired you ?
PATRICK: She wants to cover as much ground as she can . He looks them over .
ANGIE: I take it you did n't want us hired .
DOYLE: These people aren ' t rich .
PATRICK: We understand that . This is about helping in whatever way we can . Not about making money .
DOYLE: Good . I do n't care who finds her . I just want it done .
ANGIE: We want that too , sir .
DOYLE: Fine . Keep us apprised .
PATRICK: Of course is there any way we can see what you 're looking at so far ?
SMILES: I 'll put my two best men on it . Where can they find you ?

STEVE: Oh , it 's a real tragedy . She used to come in here , sit up on the bar and shit . . . She was like our mascot .
ANGIE: Helene brought Amanda in here ?
STEVE: No , mostly in the afternoons . It 's not the place for a child at night .
ANGIE: Really ?
STEVE: Hot tempers . Lotta drugs .
PATRICK: How much does Helene come in ?
STEVE: Like five nights a week . She 's a fuckin ' coke head guys . Do n't get me wrong , you do n't want that for no one . But it 's not a real shocker . I seen her on the news saying how she was at her neighbor 's for a half hour ? Bullshit . She was in here snappin ' lines for two hours .
PATRICK: Are you sure it was the same night ?
STEVE: Yeah , cause she was bumpin ' rails in the shitter with Ray . I was knockin ' on the door .

BIG DAVE: She wants to come in here and be a smart ass ?
PATRICK: Take it easy .
BIG DAVE: Don ' t run your mouth like you 're bette than me .

LENNY: 'Cool it '' Listen to this douche bag .
BIG DAVE: I bet she fucks this asshole in half . AN ALCOHOLIC calls out to Lenny .

ANGIE: Helene was in there getting highwhile her kid was at home for two hours . What kind of mother does that ?
PATRICK: One who does n't know better . A poor one . An abused one . A damaged one .
ANGIE: A selfish one . They look out over the kids running past .
PATRICK: Listen , you do n't have to do this . I 'm fine . If you want to bow out-
ANGIE: Have you ever known me to bow out on anything before ?
PATRICK: No . But that was a scary thing . Without looking at him .
ANGIE: Why ? Because of those men ? You think they were gon na rape me ? She smiles at him .
PATRICK: They were n't gon na do that .
BEAT: They might ' got shot . But they were n't
ANGIE: They ' re not what I 'm afraid of , Patrick .

INDICATED BOOTH: Have a seat .
POOLE: This is the lead we 're working Corwin Earle .
BRESSANT: Serial molester , recently work-released . Went AWOL around the time Amanda disappeared .
POOLE: Known associates Leon Trett and his handsome wife Roberta . Apparently , The three of them have some kind of Addams Family thing goin ' on . LEON TRETT , 50s ; mouse-faced and hostile .
PATRICK: Jesus .
POOLE: The Trett 's were released six , and eight months ago respectively . They have drug habits . We do n't know where they are-but we think Corwin ' s with 'em . Jailhouse snitch claims Corwin confided when he got out he was going to move in with his 'family . '
BRESSANT: He was gon na find him a kid he could keep in the house and have sex with .
PATRICK: Sounds promising .
BRESSANT: Not for Amanda it does n't .
PATRICK: That 's not what I meant
ANGIE: Is this who you think has Amanda ?
FROWNING: Well , they ' re just suspects and there 's some holes in the theory . Corwin likes oys . And he likes 'em seven to nine . A pause .
INNOCENTLY: That 's what you got ? There are no othe suspects ?
OFFENDED: Yeah . That 's it . A convicted finge laster who plans to keep a pre-teen at the foot of his bed and just cut off his
POOLE: Take it easy , Remy
BRESSANT: Who the fuck is this guy ? You 're here ecause Jack Doyle had us extend you a courtesy . You got something to contribute , be my guest . Otherwise go ack to your Harry Potter book .
PATRICK: I think you misunderstood my tone , sergeant detective . They gauge one another .
ANGIE: Is n't it usually someone who knows the victim ?
POOLE: I think Helene McCready has plenty of people in her life capable of this .
PATRICK: I 'm sure you 've interviewed Ray Likanski .
POOLE: Who ?
PATRICK: Ray Likanski . Skinny Ray ?
BEAT: No ?
BRESSANT: Never heard of him .
PATRICK: Well , with all due respect , we might be able to contribute on that point
POOLE: How ' s that ?
PATRICK: The night Amanda went missing Ray was doing coke at the Fillmore Lounge for two hours between eight and ten .
BRESSANT: Fascinating .
PATRICK: With Helene McCready .
POOLE: She did bullshit us
TO POOLE: We need to straighten her out .
ANGIE: Why would she lie about that ?
POOLE: 'Cause it 's fucking embarrassing .
PATRICK: I 'll just grab a copy.. .
BRESSANT: The kind they give you in Louisiana .
PATRICK: I thought you were from here .
BRESSANT: Depends on how you look at it . You might think you 're more 'from heref than I am , for example but then again , I been living here longer than you been alive .
BEAT: So who 's right ? Patrick shakes his head .
PATRICK: I 'll have to mull that over . He takes the photos .
BUBBA: I do n't do it sellin ' penny rocks to wall- eyed child molesters neither .
PATRICK: Just this one , Corwin Earle , is a molester . He might be staying with the other two baseheads . Just if you hea somethin ' .
BUBBA: What are you two ? Crime dogs now ?
PATRICK: We got hired to help find that little girl .
BUBBA: Oh yeah ? Good for you . What happened ?
ANGIE: Turns out the mother was down the Fillmore all night when her kid was taken .

BUBBA: Fuck him .
PATRICK: I thought you were down with them .
BUBBA: With Ray ? He works for the Haitian .
PATRICK: Ray works for Cheese ?
BUBBA: Ray , Chris , Cheese , the whole trash picker crew.. .
ANGIE: You ever sell to Helene ?
BUBBA: There 's reasons why there are n't three inches of plexiglass between us right now- -two of them being I do n't deal with coconuts like Cheese and skeezers like Helene . Because I 'm the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the fucking blind .
ON PHONE: Detective , how well do you know Cheese Jean Baptiste ?
HELENE: Who ?
POOLE: `` Cheese '' Jean Baptiste .
HELENE: It sounds familiar . . .
BRESSANT: It do n't `` sound familiar , '' Helene . He 's a violent , sociopathic , Haitian criminal named `` Cheese . '' Either you know him o you do n't .
LIONEL: Who is he ?
BEATRICE: He 's a drug lord or something , is n't he ?
LIONEL: Who is he ?
HELENE: He 's just a guy , Lionel.. .
BRESSANT: Ask his homey here .
PATRICK: He ai n't my homey .
BRESSANT: Hard to keep track with you people .
POOLE: He is , among other things , a drug dealer , Mrs. McCready .
LIONEL: What other things ?
HELENE: I don ' t know . . .
BEATRICE: Why do n't you answer your brother 's questions , Helene ?
HELENE: Why do n't you go suck a nigger 's dick , Bea ? Lionel 's FIST hits the table .

POOLE: He 's a drug dealer , a pimp , a
LIONEL: You associate with a pimp ?
BEATRICE: A pornographer , Helene . . .
POOLE: And we think he rolled Pokey Jackson up in a carpet and shot him in the head on Castlegate .
BEAT: So there 's that , too . Bea canft fathom what shefs hearing .
BRESSANT: What do you do for him ? She sighs .
HELENE: I just mule . Occasionally , and not making a habit out of it .
BEATRICE: Jesus , Mary & Joseph . What is that , Lionel ?
LIONEL: It means she 's a drug runner . She carries drugs . Is n't that right , Helene ?
HELENE: A few times .
BRESSANT: Where ?
HELENE: Providence . . . Does it matter ?
LIONEL: For what ?
HELENE: For fuckfs sake , Lionel . What do you think ? Money . A taste . . .
LIONEL: Of what , drugs ?
HELENE: Yeas , Lionel .
BEATRICE: What kind of drugs ?
HELENE: Yay , ron . . .
BEATRICE: What does that mean ?
POOLE: Cocaine and heroin .
BEATRICE: No , we would have seen the tract marks
BRESSANT: Not if you snort it , right sugar ?
HELENE: Less addictive that way .
BRESSANT: I do n't know Helene . I keep thinking about this thing I heard . You know where I 'm going with this ?
HELENE: No .
BRESSANT: Did you know I used to work DCU ?
HELENE: I give a fuck .
BRESSANT: Right . So , I still know some of those guys real well . Anyway , I heard that someone ripped Cheese off on a New Hampshire run . You did n't hear that , did you ? Angle on Patrick and Angie .
HELENE: No .

BRESSANT: Howrd you do it . She exhales a long thread of smoke .
HELENE: Two weeks ago me and Ray did a run up Nashua to drop four keys on some bikers . When we was walking back through the motel with the money , all these cops swooped in and went for the bikers . Amanda was with us so we pretended to be like a family and they went right past us . So we just got in the car and took off .
BEATRICE: You took Amanda with you ?
HELENE: What am I gon na do ? Leave her in the car , Bea ?
BEATRICE: You are an abomination . God as my witness .
GETS 'EMOTIONALR: You know what , Bea ? It 's hard bein ' a mother . It 's hard raisinf children . And if God made you barren then you can ' t judge me . 'Cause you wouldnrt fuckin ' know .
BRESSANT: Hey . Right here . What happened ? Helene takes a pull from her beer .
HELENE: When we was driving back . Ray 's like , 'everyone 's gon na think the cops got the money too . '
BRESSANT: You told Cheese the cops got it ?
PATRICK: But you and Ray kept the money ?
HELENE: This whole fuckin ' thing is Ray ' s fault . Reactions to this realization .
POOLE: Where 's the money now , Helene ? She looks at him .
BRESSANT: You want to find your daughter ?
HELENE: Of course .
POOLE: Then you need to tell us . Where is it ?

HELENE: You 're terrible . She smiles ,
PATRICK: How did the money end up with Ray in Chelsea ? I thought you went home after .
HELENE: We dropped off Amanda , went back to Ray 's then fuckin ' retarded Ray left his rock at my place right then I was like ' I 'm dropping this motherfucker , I do n't care if he does have a big dick ' so we went ack to the apartment , he was , hollerin ' and gon na wake up Amanda , who needs he sleep , so we went back to Ray ' s. Ray ' s mother 's , whatever . I do n't know where the mother is but she left all he fuckin ' cats and it smells like cock in
PATRICK: Cheese never contacted you ? They neve left a note ?
HELENE: No . We never heard nothin ' from them . That ' s why Ray said don ' t say shit . Patrick and Angie look back and forth .
ANGIE: You did n't think it was worth it , fo your daughter 's sake , to tell people what happened ?

PATRICK: He could n't tell them where it was 'cause he did n't know . Helene hid it . Bressant chuckles .
BRESSANT: Ray made poor relationship choices .
PATRICK: Guess they did n't believe him .
POOLE: Poor prick .
ENTERING: I 'm not waitin ' in the fuckin ' car
PATRICK: It 's okay . . .
HELENE: I just want my daughter home with me .
PATRICK: Did Cheese know you were on the ride with Ray ?
HELENE: I think so .
PATRICK: Okay . . . Where 's the money , Helene ? Poole and Bressant emerge from the house .
HELENE: Right here .
PATRICK: Where ?
HELENE: I buried it when Ray was passed out .
POOLE: What was that book about 'everything you need is in your own backyard ? ' It 's a French book .
BRESSANT: That was n't a book . It was a cartoon Helene knows .
HELENE: Fuck you .
ANGIE: So , you bring in the FBI at this point ?
BRESSANT: That 's the worst thing we could do .
ANGIE: Why is that ?
BRESSANT: 'Cause I do n't want Cheese to open a bag full of newspaper and kill Amanda .
ANGIE: It ' s kidnapping .
BRESSANT: I do n't see a note . You see a note ?
POOLE: Nope .
BRESSANT: We 're investigating a missing children 's case . Has nothing to do with kidnapping . He turns to Patrick and Angie .
POOLE: So everyone keep their mouths shut .
BEAT: Helene .
HELENE: Do you know Cheese ?
PATRICK: When we were ten . He hardly spoke English . His brother Jude was a sweet kid .
BEAT: Cheese went another way .
HELENE: He would n't hurt her , right ?
INDICATES HOUSE: Ask Ray .
TO HELENE: You know how he got his name ?
HELENE: No .
ANGIE: He moved here when I did . There was a lot of tension between black American kids and Haitians-and he got it the worst.He had no running water at home . This one girl was on him real hard 'cause he smelled bad , calling him 'cheese . ' All of a sudden , he breaks a bottle , holds her down , and carves the word Cheese in her face . She lost an eye . Someone found it on the sidewalk the next day .
PATRICK: And the name stuck .
ANGIE: But I 'm sure Amanda will be fine .
BRESSANT: Just keep your mouth shut , okay ? We can get her back . It 'll be fine . I have no fear of this idiot .
TO BRESSANT: You 're gon na talk to him ?
BRESSANT: That 's the next step , yeah .
HELENE: Tell him I 'm sorry . Tell him I apologize .
POOLE: Sorry goes a long way .
HELENE: She 's a handful , that one . At least I know she 's giving them hell .
PATRICK: What about Ray ?
BRESSANT: You know what percentage of murders were solved last year in Boston ? Twenty nine . Less in Chelsea .
POOLE: Take her home . We 'll handle Chelsea . They move to go .
HELENE: I 'm hungry .
PATRICK: We ' 11 get you some food .
HELENE: No , her . That 's the last thing she said to me before I put her to bed . She said , 'Ifm hungry . '' I mean , they fed her , ight ? She 's not still hungry ?
PATRICK: I donft know .
HELENE: I know I f u c k e d u p .
PATRICK: I t ' s okay , w e ' l l f i n d h e r .
PATRICK: 1/11 t r y . I w i l l .
HELENE: You h a v e t o promise . Patrick looks a t her .
PATRICK: I promise .
PATRICK: Go i n s i d e .
BRESSANT: Where do you think you 're going ?
PATRICK: To talk to Cheese .
POOLE: No you 're not .
BRESSANT: Get back in your car .
PATRICK: That 's a mistake . He 'll never talk to a adge . I know him . If there 's a deal to e brokered we 're the ones who can do it .
BRESSANT: No . Me and Nick are handling this . This is too important .
PATRICK: If you two go in , negotiate a ransom fo a girl , then it is kidnapping and that 's the FBI .
ANGIE: All you 're gon na do is scare him and the more scared he is the worse it is fo her . The look at each other .
PATRICK: Do you want to get the kid back or not ?
BRESSANT: I 'm gon na take that as a rhetorical question .
PATRICK: Sit fuckin ' tight . We know him , he111 talk to us and we 'll be right back .
CHEESE: Been a long time .
GIRL: You know I ' 11 be right here .
CHEESE: Bitches love the cheddar . Small laugh .
PATRICK: How you been , Chris ?
CHRIS MULLEN: Better than you .
PATRICK: Good to hear it .
TO CHRIS: Be cool .
BEAT: Been too long not to see a fool . I give you an audience .
PATRICK: We found what you were lookin ' for in Chelsea .
CHEESE: What makes you think I am concerned with the doings in Chelsea ?
PATRICK: Cause I know one of the idiots who robbed you lives there .
CHEESE: What idiot ?
PATRICK: The one you just killed .
CHEESE: I do n't know about nobody gettin ' killed . If someone robbed me and end up dead , you know , life a ma ' fucker .
ANGIE: Cheese , I appreciate you 're seeing us . I know you 're busy so we ' 11 be quick .
BEAT: We have your money . It was buried in Ray ' s backyard .
CHEESE: What you talkin ' about ? What girl ?
PATIENCE TRIED: You know what girl . Cheese . Amanda McCready . Who has nothing to do with Helene stealing from you .
BEAT: Do n't punish her for who her mother is .
PATRICK: Cheese , look at me . No one gives a fuck what you did . I never even liked Ray . You get the money . The girl goes home to her mother we 'll say we found her in the ushes or whatever .
CHEESE: I donft know .
PATRICK: No . Don ' t do this , bro . This isn ' t the time for that . This is where you take the offer . It 's either this real quiet or it 's ten thousand fuckin ' cops kickin ' the door down and arresting everybody .
CHEESE: First of all , do n't never come up in my spot like that . You got my money ? You can leave that shit in the mailbox on you ass way out . Feel me ? Some othe motherfuckers let fools rob on 'em . I do n't play scrimmage but I do n't fuck with no kids Something occurs to Cheese .
BEAT: What ? You thought we was cool ? I ai n't
TO ANGIE: You , too , baby . Show me them tetons .
PATRICK: If you point a gun at her again I 'm gon na pull your fuckin ' card , okay ?
BEAT: You ' re saying you did n't do it ? Okay . What other choice do I have ? We 'll take your money and go along our way .
CHEESE: Do n't never speak to me that way .
HE SMILES: You ai n't shit . Yo bitch ai n't shit . Neither one of y'all motherfuckers is shit . Fuck both ya ' 11 . If you did n't have two pig out in my meadow ! put a round in both your heads right now .
POOLE: What happened ?
ANGIE: He said he did n't know anything but if we had his money we could leave it in the mailbox .
BRESSANT: Is that what he told you ?
PATRICK: Yeah , that 's it .
POOLE: He said nothing else ?
PATRICK: He wants you off his fuckin ' lawn .
POOLE: I thought you knew the guy .
BRESSANT: Half the guys he grew up with are degenerates .
PATRICK: You know what the other half are ?
BRESSANT: What ?
PATRICK: Cops . But do n't hold it against me .
BRESSANT: Nah . You know what I hold against you ? We had one chance to make this deal . You said you knew him , you said you could do it and you fucked it up . Now we have to get a warrant for a tap , start surveillance and hope to Christ we get lucky . If that costs Amanda her life , I wo n't have to hold it against you . You 'll hold it against yourself for a good , long time .
ANGIE: Look , the Police taking over is n't necessarily a bad thing .
PATRICK: No ?
ANGIE: They see more child exploitation in a week than we could in a career
PATRICK: Makes you want to have kids .
ANGIE: Does it make you not want to ? Patrick drinks his beer .
PATRICK: There 's a political party in Holland that openly advocates pedophelia and won seats in parliament . In America four hundred thousand kids get abused every year . There are half a million convicted , egistered sex offenders , two-thirds of them for molesting children unde fourteen , there are a hundred thousand child porn web sites . They busted one in texas had seventy thousand members people who gave their credit cards . . . There 's a group , the 'Rene Guyon ' society , whose motto is 'sex before eight or it 's too late . ' There 's a rise in the victimization of 'pre-verbal ' children , for the obvious reason that they ca n't eport their accusers . One in five American girls is sexually abused o victimized before they turn eighteen . But only one third of those every tells anyone in their lifetime that they were abused . She gives him a look 'oh , really ? '
ANGIE: And that tells you you do n't want children .
PATRICK: It tells me there are n't enough gas chambers . A beat .
ANGIE: Yeah ?
PATRICK: I 'm just not sure a kid would love to be here . She looks sympathetic .
ANGIE: Yeah ?
BRESSANT: Guess you did something right .
ANGIE: What ?
BRESSANT: Cheese came around . Called in and said he wants to make a drop . Said he left something in your mailbox .
ANGIE: Really ?
BRESSANT: Well , you 're gon na have to check the mailbox yourself , but yeah .
ANGIE: Great .
BRESSANT: It is and it is n't . They tape calls coming into the station now .
ANGIE: What does that mean ?
BRESSANT: It means Jack heard about it , he wants you down here and he 's fuckin ' pissed .
PATRICK: What are you doing here ?
DEVIN: When the boss wants you met , he only sends the best .
ANGIE: Or when he wants you brought up the back way . Devin smiles .
DEVIN: That , too .
RENE: Yeah he said just let 'em in .
DEVIN: That 's what he said ?
DOYLE: You 're late .
PATRICK: Caller Bitch you better have my money .
DOYLE: The `` lake '' he refers to is the water in the abandoned quarry . He refers to the transcript .
ANGIE: Captain , we were concerned for the safety
DOYLE: I understand what your concern was . My concern , interestingly , is also for the well being of that child . And now that concern has been elevated because of the isky and ill-advised course of action you people have taken .
BRESSANT: You do n't have to be party to it , sir . . .
DOYLE: The hell I do n't . If I delay this now , after this agreement , it would only further endanger the life of this girl . Does that sound like something you expect me to do ?
PATRICK: I 'll accept responsibility for
DOYLE: You ' 11 accept Don ' t come in here and get noble with me . Responsibility is earned . You ca n't take something you have no shoulder for . He gathers his composure .
BRESSANT: They want to separate us . He points to diverging paths on the map .
BEAT: Once Amanda is turned over to you at you position , call us on the radio and we 'll turn over the cash . Doyle , having been observing , interjects .
DOYLE: This man wo n't come alone . Who is he likely to bring ?
PATRICK: Chris Mullen was in the apartment when we made the offer .
DOYLE: What do you know about him ?
PATRICK: Well , it was probably him that killed Ray for Cheese . If I had to guess .
POOLE: He did n't ask you what you guessed . He asked you what do you know .
PATRICK: I know he 's a six foot , thirty year old , caucasian heroin addict . And I know it was him , not Cheese , who rolled up Pokey Jackson and shot him in the head .
BEAT: So there 's that , too . Remy is the voice of reason today .
BRESSANT: I think we 're all set here , Captain .
DOYLE: No one else knows about this , correct ? Angie has a concern .
ANGIE: I just wonder.. .
DOYLE: Yes ?
ANGIE: Are we rationalizing this ? I mean , would n't a hundred police up there be etter for her than the four of us ? Doyle stops .
DOYLE: What does that mean ?
ANGIE: I 'm asking if keeping this quiet is etter for Amanda , or is it better fo us ? Doyle is opaque .
DOYLE: Do you have any children , Miss Gennaro ? She shakes her head .
BEAT: And that I never came .
TO ANGIE: No one 's questioning you . He relaxes a little .
DOYLE: I honor my daughter with this , this division , so no parent has to live what I 've known . . .Not even a woman like Helene McCready .
THAT GIRL: is all I care about . And we 're going to ing her home .
ANGIE: Why is he bringing us all the way up here ?
PATRICK: Dark , big , make sure he can get away .
ANGIE: No . Something 's wrong .
PATRICK: All he wants is the money . He just does n't want to get arrested doing it .
ANGIE: They 're gon na kill her . I can feel it . He looks out the window .
POOLE: This asshole could have picked somewhere on level ground .
BRESSANT: Keep the lights off for now .
ANGIE: Is this where all the peak rocks have names ?
PATRICK: ( listing the names of the
PEAKS: Running Tierny , Leo , Dan , Gooch , Jigger , Goreski and runnin ' Mike .
POOLE: Where 'd they get those fuckin ' names ?
PATRICK: From the kids who died tryin ' to jump off em..
BRES SANT: This is where we part ways
SMILES: Divide and conquer .
POOLE: Be careful .
ANGIE: You be careful .
BRESSANT: Call us on the radio when you have her .
PATRICK: We will .
BRESSANT: Fuck it .
PATRICK: How are they gon na get Amanda to us up
HERE: A SPLASH IN THE WATER breaks the silence
ANGIE: Where did she fall ! ? Patrick gets up and runs to the quarry edge .
POOLE: We heard it , too .
BRESSANT: First thing I saw was something went in .
ANGIE: Where is she ? !
PATRICK: What happened ?
BRESSANT: We got one , the other took off .
PATRICK: Right there !
POOLE: Jesus . She DIVES beneath the surface . . .
PATRICK: Is your leg alright ?
ANGIE: It will be . You hear anything ?
PATRICK: Cops found no one up there . Shocker . I guess as soon as they had the money , someone shot Cheese and another guy came out shootin ' . They must have tossed he in .
ANGIE: Why ?
PATRICK: I do n't know . She saw their faces . Fo some people that 's enough .
ANGIE: But you and me could recognize Chris .
PATRICK: Remy said the other two kids were black . So it was n't Chris .
ANGIE: Have they found her ?
PATRICK: No , but they got divers up there now , so.. .
ANGIE: Then she could be alive . She could be hiding . She could be stuck . . .
PATRICK: Yeah but , the one cop told me that two years ago some guy killed his wife and dumped her in there the divers found the body . . .but it was so dark they lost it and then they could never find it again . There 's so many crags and outcroppings and old cars and shit .
BEAT: So do n't get your hopes up . He sees she is crying .
ANGIE: I 'm sorry . . . I 'm sorry . .
PATRICK: Don ' t say that .
ANGIE: I 'm sorry.. .
PATRICK: It 's okay . We creep back slowly as the news plays .
PATRICK: It 's bullshit . He was trying to save he life .
POOLE: They do n't see it that way .
PATRICK: Can he fight it ?
BRESSANT: When you gamble , you do n't put money on the table if you 're gon na cry about losing it .
PATRICK: What did he get ?
BRESSANT: The dignity of early retirement and the humiliation of half a pension .
PATRICK: What about you guys ?
POOLE: You do n't have to call Remy 'sergeant ' detective anymore .
BRESSANT: Hey look , it 's patrolman Raftopolous- They laugh .
PATRICK: Hey . Angie does n't say anything .
ANGIE: It 's not your fault .
PATRICK: Yeah it is . I wanted to do this .
ANGIE: I did , too .

PATRICK: It does n't matter .
KNOWING: Yes it does .
PATRICK: I had a priest who always said , `` shame is God 's voice telling us where we did wrong. ``
BRESSANT: Fuck him , you did good .
PATRICK: Murder is a sin .
BRESSANT: Depends on who you do it to .
BRESSANT: I planted evidence on a guy once .

Anyway , he tells us there 's a guy pumpin ' out of an apartment in Colombia point . Me and Nick go in this was fifteen years ago ; when Nicky went in , it was no joke .
PATRICK: Jesus .
BRESSANT: The father has the kid living in a crack den , subsisting on twinkles and ass- whippings and the kid is still asking me , `` is my daddy all right ? ''
BEAT: You 're worried about what 's Christian ? Kids forgive , they do n't judge , they turn the other cheek .
BEAT: I went back out and put an ounce of heroin on the living room floor . Sent the father on a ride . Seven to nine .
PATRICK: Think you did the right thing ?
BRESSANT: I do n't give a fuck . You take a side . You beat a child , you molest a child , you hurt a child you ai n't on my side . And hope you do n't run into me because I will lay you the fuck down . Easy .
PATRICK: Doesn ' t feel easy .
BRESSANT: Look , was he better off without the father ? Yes . But okay , the kid might be out there , pumpin7 with a gun in his waistband . It 's a war . Are we winning ? No . Look , I got a great wife , money saved , hit my 30 in three months , pick up that pension and hail a fucking cab . Go down

DEV IN: Said he loved her . Told Mike Snell to fuck himself , put in for a transfer .
PATRICK: To Doyle .
DEVIN: They go back .
PATRICK: Doyle and Remy ?
DEVIN: Doyle.brought Remy with him from Louisiana in '72 . My man Doyle rolled into Boston as a black cop and then married a white woman in '74 .

DEVIN: I only know one thing . And it 's from another guy , so take it as that . . . He sighs .

PATRICK: How did Remy find out that quick ?
DEVIN: If I knew that , I would n't be here talkin ' to you . And be sure on how fa you want to go with this
BEAT: You start investigating Police it 's a whole other level . You try to take food out of their mouths they will fuck you
PATRICK: Trust me . I know I 'm right . He lied to us ecause he did n't want us to know he knew Ray . That ' s the whole thing .
ANGIE: And how is it possible that he could know the money was stolen before anyone else .
PATRICK: The same way everyone in this neighborhood knows everyone else 's usiness .
BEAT: Someone tells them . She looks dubious .
ANGIE: This is reckless . It 's one thing to get obsessed yourself because that 's what you need to go through but this man lost , asically , his child . If you do this , you etter fuckin ' be right .
PATRICK: I understand that . I 'm not asking you to elieve I 'm right . I 'm asking you to elieve in me .

PATRICK: Then what ?
LIONEL: Then we took her .
BEAT: Remy laid out this plan , it seemed easy . We take her , force Helene and Ray to cough up the money , and then put he ack . You know ? Amanda gets a weekend in the country ; My sister learns a lesson ; And fuck it , we 'll all get paid on top of it . . . I got no problem taking money from a guy like Cheese .
PAUSE: They were gon na handle the cops , but Bea went nuts calling the papers and hired you . Once you found the money they had Amanda and the money . So they decided to set up a fake exchange for you to witness . They got Chris Mullen to set Cheese up at the quarry for 15k and a chance to be the boss . Even though it was too late , Cheese figured out what was happening and started shooting . You have to understand , I never been around that . Everyone was panickin ' and she . . .
A BEAT: . . . she got scared and she ran .
ANOTHER BEAT: And she just fell in .
ANGIE: She was your sister 's kid , Lionel .
BEAT: Your sister 's c h i l d .
LIONEL: You do n't think I miss her ? She was more my kid than Helene 's .
BEAT: Last summer , Helene and Dottie took Amanda to the beach . Real hot day . Amanda fell asleep and they left her in the ca to go off with some guys in the dunes . For two hours . Amanda literally roasted . She was t h r e e . He listens skeptically .
PAUSE: When I got over there I found my niece in the bathtub , schriekin ' in pain and she eeked , like beer . The best my siste could come up with to ease her daughter 's pain was to douse her in cold beer . But not all of it , she wanted to `` save some . '' Long exhale .
BEAT: So do n't feel too sorry for my sister . She never cared about anyone but herself .
POPEYE: This will all be over in a minute if everyone stays calm .
TEAMSTER: Do you know who 's bar this is , shit-head ?
POPEYE: Or you can get wise . It 's up to you .
DART PLAYER: We got families .
POPEYE: Pipe down . He turns to Lionel .
TO LIONEL: You1re a talker , huh ? Keep yapping motherfucker .
TO LIONEL: You want to keep talking trash ? Okay .
TO LIONEL: Close your eyes , Mouth . Close 'em tight .
LIONEL: You do n't have to do this
LIONEL: Wait . Jesus .
PATRICK: Amanda McCready was taken by Remy Bressant !
BRESSANT: Do n't say that fucking name !
LIONEL: I already told him we did it for ransom . I told him we did it for ransom ! Remy . . . Please . Ill .
BRESSANT: Fuck . . .
SECRETARY: Call 911 ! Call 911 !
BRESSANT: That bartender was n't fuckin ' around . Patrick kicks away the gun .
PATRICK: Fuck you . You let this little girl die . You want to tell me how to live ? Patrick looks at Remy .
BRESSANT: I know .
PATRICK: You know ? You let a girl go off a cliff . What do you know ? You do n't know . Bressant just smiles at him .
BRESSANT: Yeah .
PATRICK: Why would I expose a conspiracy I was a part of ?
BEAT: Did Lionel contradict anything I said ? Did the witnesses ? The Captain stands .
CAPTAIN: A Police officer was killed today . That 's not looked on lightly .
PATRICK: Is corruption looked on lightly ?
BEEFY OFFICER: You got a smart mouth .
PATRICK: How is getting a little girl killed looked on ?
CAPTAIN: We 'd like to ensure that you 're telling us the truth . Is that all right with you ? Hot shit ?
PATRICK: It 's fine , hot shit .
CAPTAIN: So , after setting up Jean Baptiste , you friend Chris Mullen was coincidentally killed ? And you did n't have nothing to do with it ?
PATRICK: He was probably killed by Sgt . Detective Remy Bressant or anyone else who wanted the 130K in his backpack .
BEAT: He 's not my friend .
BEEFY OFFICER: You charge money as a detective . But you were at the quarry and yet you had no idea it was a set up ?
PATRICK: I trust the Police when they tell me something . And I had a fake ransom note and Amanda 's blanket the cops left in my mailbox . And I heard the tape from when Cheese , or I guess it was Chris pretending to be Cheese , called the station .
CAPTAIN: A 911 call ?
PATRICK: No . The call into the station from Cheese to Remy .
CAPTAIN: We do n't tape calls into the station .
BEAT: And we do n't do transcripts , smart guy .
BEEFY OFFICER: Did you hear a tape ?
PATRICK: No .
BEEFY OFFICER: Did you see a transcript ?
PATRICK: I must have remembered it wrong . Remy ead it to me . The Police look at him .
CAPTAIN: Calm down .
BEAT: You 're released . But Mr. Kenize
WINKS: I hope you do n't get pulled over any time soon .
ANGIE: What happened ?
PATRICK: They kept my shoelaces . She smiles .
ANGIE: We 'll go down to Zayre 's tomorrow and get you some new ones .
PATRICK: I do n't want to do that tomorrow .
ANGIE: What do you want to do ?
PATRICK: Take a trip .
ANGIE: You want to tell me where our trip has taken us ?
PATRICK: You know where we are .
BEAT: He would never , ever do something to endanger a child .
PATRICK: Are you sure ?
ANGIE: Yes .
PATRICK: He was a part of it . They do n't tape calls . He handed us a transcript like it was evidence and he knew it was a forgery- -maybe he forged it himself . He knew what they were doing , he supported it and he covered it up .
ANGIE: Why ? For a third of a hundred and thirty grand ? What for ? He just looks at her .
PATRICK: Had to be for something .
ANGIE: When you 're talking about ruining an old man who lost his child and gave years of service . . . `` something '' is n't enough .
PATRICK: For a guy who tried to ruin us , something ' s plenty .
ANGIE: This is the kind of thing where if you do it , you want to be sure .
BEAT: Are you sure ?
PATRICK: No .
BEAT: Are you coming ?
ANGIE: No . And he goes down the road .
AMANDA: Do n't forget mine , gramma .
FRANCINE: I 'd never forget yours , sweetheart .
AMANDA: Can I have a , please a sandwich ?
DOYLE: What kind do you want .
AMANDA: Grill Cheese .
DOYLE: You like the crusts on , right ?
AMANDA: Noooo ! I do n't like the crusts on !
FAKES REMEMBERING: That ' s right , that 's right .
PATRICK: Jesus .
ANGIE: She 's alive .
PATRICK: No.. .
ANGIE: She ' s happy here .
BEAT: I saw her .
PATRICK: Angie , do n't do this .
ANGIE: If you call the Police they 'll send he ack .
PATRICK: I need you on my side .
ANGIE: I am on your side but I ca n't send he ack .
PATRICK: We 're not sending her anywhere . That 's her mother . She has a right to he child .
ANGIE: He 's better for her .
PATRICK: Why ? Because he has money and makes sandwiches ?
SIMPLY: Because he loves her .
PATRICK: Helene loves her , too .
ANGIE: No .
PATRICK: She might learn from this .
ANGIE: No . People do n't change . Angle grows more impassioned .
PATRICK: You ca n't take away someone 's kid .
ANGIE: I do n't want to . I want to leave thei child with them .
PATRICK: ~ l this time we wanted to bring he
ANGIE: Because I know right and wrong when I see it .
PATRICK: I need you to understand me right now . I need you to love me and say I know this is a hard decision but I stand by you . I need you to take me home and make this okay .
ANGIE: I can do that . I can take you home and I know how to make it okay .
BEAT: Because we 'll know she 's in a good school and safe and has sleep overs and birthday parties and smiles every day .
PATRICK: You ca n't ask me to do something I ca n't do .
ANGIE: You ca n't ask me to live with it , She makes a plea .
BEAT: I 'll hate you for doing it . I do n't want to but I will .
DOYLE: Patrick Kenzie . To what do I owe the pleasure ? He holds Doyle 's look .
PATRICK: Remy Bressant died last night .
DOYLE: I was told . It 's a shame .
PATRICK: Hard to understand . He seemed like a good man .
DOYLE: He was a good man . You do n't know why people do what they do . Only they see out their own windows .
AMANDA: Papapa . Come make sandwiches now please .
TO FRANCINE: It 's all right .
TO AMANDA: Go inside , my sweet . I 'll be there soon and make you a sandwich . Francine hesitates . Doyle is gentle .
PATRICK: Men killed for .
DOYLE: I 'm giving that little girl a life .
PATRICK: It 's not your life to give . Helene is her mother . You think she 's a bad mothe you should have gone to social services . Short of that , it 's her mother , it 's where she belongs .
DOYLE: Turn around , get back in your car and wait thirty years . You do n't know what the world is made of yet .
PATRICK: I know I 'm tired of being lied to and tired of being lectured by a gang of criminals . I 'm calling the State Police in five minutes . They 'll be here in ten .
DOYLE: No .
BEAT: You have n't made that call because you think it might be an irreparable mistake . Because part of you believes it does n't matter what the rules say . Because you know , when the lights go out and it 's just you and your conscience you ask yourself if she 's better here or bette there , you know the answer and you always will .
PATRICK: See you at the arraignment .
DOYLE: You can do one good pure thing here today . One right thing . Most men do n't get that chance in a lifetime .
BEAT: You walk away from that , you may not egret it when you get home , or in a yea ut I promise you , get to where I am , you will . But I 'll be dead by then , you 'll e old , and she 'll be trailing a ragged , tattered childhood of her own and you 'll be the one who has to tell them you ' re sorry .
PATRICK: Then I guess I will . I 'll tell them I 'm sorry and I 'll live with it . And maybe that will happen , what I 'm not gon na do , is have to apologize to a grown woman who says , why did you leave me ? I got kidnapped , my aunt hired you to find me , and you did . You found me with a strange family but you broke your promise and you left me there . Why ? Why did n't you ing me home ?
I STILL: Then you 'll have to excuse me . have a sandwich left to make . He turns and walks inside .
ANGIE: Sorryr I had to come back and get some stuff .
PATRICK: It 's okay . She looks at himl almost sympathetic .
ANGIE: There 's nothing to say
PATRICK: Hi . Amanda looks at him ' blankly . She returns her attention to the TV .
PATRICK: Who ?
HELENE: My date .
PATRICK: I 'm sure he will .
HELENE: Aww ' you ' re sweet . He seen me on my American Victim and he wrote me letters and I was like whatever ' but then he saw my Katie Couric and drove down here from Providence so I was likef that 's omantic ' right ? Patrick forces a smile .
HESITATES: She 's all right . She 's up the north shore with her sister .
FLIRTY: If she donrt get smart ' I 'll take you out . Hope she got better family than I do ' ight ?
PATRICK: Howfs Bea ?
HELENE: I would n't let her in the apartment .
JUSTIFYING: Whatr I want to lose her again ? Forget it .
BEAT: She sold her unit . Moved out to fancy pants in Melrose . Good riddance .
PATRICK: Yeah .
HELENE: Don ' t think she didnft hate you fo Lionel goinr to jail .
PATRICK: Probably why she never paid my bill .
HELENE: You should fuckin ' sue .
PATRICK: How about youf Helene ? You hate me ?
HELENE: Euck no . Brother or not he took my kid . Euck him . She could ' a been hurt .
PATRICK: What about Amanda ?
HELENE: What about Amanda ?
PATRICK: Who 's watching her ?
HELENE: Dottie .
PATRICK: Dottie know that ?
HELENE: She will in five minutes .
GIGGLES: Shit , I 'm gon na be late , too . Patrick waits .

KIP: Lem me out of this
CALITRI: Were it only that easy
KIP: We can still do it
CALITRI: No you ca n't . Flies on sherbert is what you emind me of . Because just being attracted to something , does n't mean you belong
KIP: Listen , Calitri
CALITRI: Call me `` Ray . '' Better yet call me `` asshole . '' Cos that 's how you 've treated me
KIP: I get out of this I 'm gon na fuck you up
MEMPHIS: Kip ?

KIP: I think so . There 's things I ca n't feel right now . Like my feet . But You think you can get me outta this , Memphis ? I 'd appreciate it -
MEMPHIS: Just hold-on there
KIP: This has nothing to do with any of that

MEMPHIS: What do you got ?
KIP: Not much . I got olives . You like olives ? Kalamata olives rule , I think . Ma likes the Calabrese . It 's more mellow And he brings over a bowl of olives .
MEMPHIS: There 's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
KIP: Yeah , yeah . That 's what I 'm thinking
MEMPHIS: So what are you gon na do ?
KIP: About what ?
MEMPHIS: `` About what ? ''
KIP: About Calitri ? No worries , man . I 'll call him . He 's a reasonable dude
MEMPHIS: I can see that -
KIP: Yeah . He just wants to know I 'm still on it . He needs reassurance . All these big swinging dicks do . No worries . I wo n't let him get into our Kool-Aid
MEMPHIS: What happened to you ?
KIP: What ?
MEMPHIS: You just got crushed in a car . You 're leeding all over your self . And you sit there - eating olives and talking asketball , as if , at this very moment , people were n't plotting your demise
KIP: C'mon , man My `` demise '' Overreaction
MEMPHIS: `` Over '' You know - I can maybe understand , since I been gone , you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime , and for that I can partly lame myself . But what is baffling to me , is how , since I been gone , you 've become a complete and total moron
KIP: Hey , now -
MEMPHIS: He 's gon na kill you !
KIP: I can handle it
MEMPHIS: You can handle it ?

KIP: Not really But you know Maybe I 'm wrong
ATLEY JACKSON: Nicolo , how 's the yellowtail today ?
FISHERMAN: Very nice , Atley . Very nice
ATLEY JACKSON: You ca n't get it any fresher than this , Memphis From the sea to my skillet Nothing in between
MEMPHIS: What 's with the fish thing ?
ATLEY JACKSON: We can learn something from our Asian friends . They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day ; they 're completely stressed and overworked ; they drink like , well
MEMPHIS: Fish .
ATLEY JACKSON: And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world . You know why ? All they eat is seafood .
MEMPHIS: Also , never underestimate the restorative powers of `` Karaoke . ''
ATLEY JACKSON: I do a poaching number . Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine . In 8 minutes , I could cater a goddamn wedding . Plain but flavorful . And it 's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce
MEMPHIS: You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
ATLEY JACKSON: I do Christ , what happened to us ?
MEMPHIS: Speak for yourself , boss I do n't have a Hollandaise sauce
ATLEY JACKSON: No , but you dress like an asshole They walk
MEMPHIS: I think about that night a lot
ATLEY JACKSON: Me , too . Every time I walk

ATLEY JACKSON: Yeah ?
MEMPHIS: Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it 's on Atley nods
ATLEY JACKSON: Any idea how you 're gon na go at it ?
OTTO: Am I dying ? Are all the angels of my life eturning to bid a final farewell ? And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense ?
MEMPHIS: Hello , Otto
OTTO: You remember Junie ?
MEMPHIS: Of course . Hi , Junie
JUNIE: Hello , Memphis -
MEMPHIS: What happened here ?
OTTO: Whatever do you mean ?
MEMPHIS: The chop-shop Where are the stripped cars ? The rolled-back odometers ? The part bins ?
OTTO: What happened ? Old-age happened . I tired of
MEMPHIS: You , too , Otto
OTTO: I heard rumors you were back . About Kip
MEMPHIS: He 's gotten involved Otto looks up frustrated To Junie
OTTO: Are you considering a comeback tour ?
MEMPHIS: Tell me
OTTO: It can be done . Take two days to shop ; one to prep . I 'll offer up my bible for a small fee . You also have to hope Kip 's jerk-circus did n't undo Castlebeck 's linkage so much so that he 's setting up surveillance teams on every city block . And then get yourself a crew
MEMPHIS: The hard part
OTTO: `` A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes , and then to get around them '' Nietzsche said that .
MEMPHIS: Is he still working here ?
OTTO: The old crew . Go find them . I ca n't help you with that . Since I 've cleaned up the act a bit , they no longer come around A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
MEMPHIS: I Just do n't know how happy they 'll be to see me
OTTO: I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal . worst car ever built . Value job . Everything broke and I-fixed it . A coma car - built to German specs . Plastic gas line . 3 speedometer head . On a quiet night , you could hear it usting in the garage . But when that car was gone , I missed it . If it came driving back in here right now , there 'd be tears and laughter
MEMPHIS: And the moral of that story is ?
OTTO: Go to them . They 'll be happy to see you Ahhh
DONNY ASTRICKY: Pull over ! Pull her the hell over !
JENNY: I 'm sorry .
DONNY ASTRICKY: You ai n't sorry . You 're a horrible driver You ca n't strap into your seat belt , without almost getting creamed by a bus She starts to cry Donny softens DONNY ASTRICKY Aw , c'mon . It 's no big deal . You ca n't drive . You ca n't . Time to acknowledge it and move on . I ca n't swim . I know I ca n't . So you know what I do ? I stay the fuck outta the pool
MEMPHIS: How you doing , man ?
DONNY ASTRICKY: All I get are the Orientals . They can uild 'em , but they ca n't drive 'em So ? What are you doing here ? What 's with the outfit ?
MEMPHIS: You know where the others are ?
DONNY ASTRICKY: Most of 'em are gone . The Dyar Boys are doing a nickel at Chino ; Henry Santoro and Frankie Fish are moving weight in Florida ; Bill Doolin was killed in Denver Atley Jackson 's on the gimp and runnin ' errands for Calitri ; The Sphinx is still around , I guess Then of course , there 's His pause is meaningful
MEMPHIS: Forget that
DONNY ASTRICKY: Okay . Figure it forgotten . What 's this about anyways ?
MEMPHIS: That 's right . Only 10 exotics
DONNY ASTRICKY: We 'll have to start beating the ushes , find out where they live Otto enters . Giggles
OTTO: Some crew you got
MEMPHIS: If we put out the word . That we 're crewing-up , for a one-time-only job What do you think that 'll yield ?
DONNY ASTRICKY: A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men . This ai n't like the old days , Memphis . The profession has lost its..
OTTO: Dignity
DONNY ASTRICKY: Yeah
MEMPHIS: Well , the three of us don't'exactly inspire confidence Beat Donny examines the list
DONNY ASTRICKY: Wow ! They got Eleanor here ?
MEMPHIS: I know . Weird , huh ?
WORKER: Otto , there 's someone here to
DONNY ASTRICKY: Lookit Kip . All grown up
KIP: Hey , Donny
MEMPHIS: What are you doing here ?
KIP: Otto called - Memphis looks to Otto Otto shrugs
OTTO: You need him
MEMPHIS: No we do n't -
OTTO: I appreciate your dilemma , Memphis . But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days
MEMPHIS: His criminal career has officially come to a close
OTTO: The conundrum still applies , of course . The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue aby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime . However . This can not be successfully carried out without baby brother 's considerable resources , shabby though they may be .
MEMPHIS: We do this . Then . You 're finished . Then . You 're clean
KIP: I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit
MEMPHIS: You hear me ?
KIP: I hear ya . Get me outta this . I 'll move to the country . Open a fruit stand Memphis looks at him Shakes his head
DONNY ASTRICKY: You guys have any skills at all ?
KIP: Hell , yeah . Mirror Man here is our electronics expert . He 's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of ; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels , and some things without ; Toby 's a hacker , can do things with a computer , that are pretty amazing
MEMPHIS: How old are you now , Toby ?
TOBY: Sixteen . But my birthday 's in seven months Memphis shakes his head Sighs
DONNY ASTRICKY: What about him ?
KIP: Freb can order pizzas like nobody 's usiness Freb starts to Protest Shrugs
FREB: People got ta eat Memphis looks at all of them Sighs
MEMPHIS: Okay , then Otto ?
OTTO: In order to succeed , you 're going to have to go old-school . one night oost . Put all your nuts in one basket . And
TUMBLER: One night ? Are you nuts ?
MEMPHIS: You got maybe a better plan ? Tumbler looks to Kip
KIP: You spread it out you move around So 's they ca n't touch you so 's they do n't know Shadow games and shit
MEMPHIS: `` Shadow games ? ''
KIP: Shadow games
MEMPHIS: You spread it out , by the 2nd night , the heat are onto you . Know something 's up . With a one-night boost , y the time all the cars are reported stolen , your ship 's set sail . Kip and the others nod Makes sense MEMPHIS Go on , Otto -
DONNY ASTRICKY: There 's no one left
OTTO: We 've got several Italian cars on the list . Always tricky , always timeconsuming . So we 're gon na need a specialist
MIRROR MAN: You know of one ?
MEMPHIS: Yeah . He 's knows of one all right .
DRUNK: One more , girl -
SWAY: I think you 've had enough , Billy
DRUNK: Enough ? I have n't even started , girl . Gim me another
SWAY: If you leave now , Billy , you can get a head-start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit
DRUNK: Listen , you little cooze
SWAY: Come back when you 've learned how to drink , Billy
MEMPHIS: See you 're still stealing the sailors from the sea
SWAY: What are you doing here ?
MEMPHIS: The hip , cool , sexy thing was getting old
SWAY: You look like you lost your sheep And she hops back behind the bar
MEMPHIS: You still wrenching at Bacchiochi 's ?
SWAY: Hell , yeah . I 'm not getting rich in here
MEMPHIS: Buy you a drink ?
SWAY: Nope . I got a coffee . And a oyfriend .
MEMPHIS: `` Mitch ? ''
SWAY: Mitch .
MEMPHIS: So I was replaced by Mitch ?
SWAY: No . You were replaced by Alex . Who was replaced by Kevin . Who was replaced by Vince . Who was eplaced by Mitch She smiles sourly at him
MEMPHIS: Wow . And to think all I accomplished these past six years was the `` LORD OF THE RINGS '' trilogy
SWAY: Yeah , well , you always were a sucke for flawed existences ANGLE - MITCH . Watching them talk SWAY You should leave
MEMPHIS: On account of Mitch ?
SWAY: On account of me . He studies her Then
MEMPHIS: I 've taken the spear for a lot of people , Sway . Including you . Ca n't we improvise a little here ?
SWAY: No can do . Life goes on , pointfive You left me , remember ?
MEMPHIS: I left town . I did n't leave you .
SWAY: A distinction worth noting
MEMPHIS: And here I am
SWAY: Yes . But I got a feeling it 's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
MEMPHIS: Kip 's in trouble And now she looks concerned
SWAY: What kind of trouble ?
MEMPHIS: Kip took a job . Fifty ladies in two weeks . Only the two weeks have turned into fou days . And not a single lady has been snared .
SWAY: And you got some Italians ?
MEMPHIS: Six or seven
SWAY: I 'm not doing it anymore . Have n't for a while . I 've carved out something for myself . It 's pathetic , but it 's mine
MEMPHIS: I understand -
MITCH: Another round , Sara -
SWAY: Sure , Mitch -
MITCH: How you doing , pal ?
MEMPHIS: I 'd go so far as to say `` lovely . ''
MITCH: You should her face when she 's having sex And Memphis turns to him
MEMPHIS: Really ?
MITCH: Really
MEMPHIS: What 's it look like ?
SWAY: What the hell are you doing ?
MEMPHIS: If you change your mind . We 're at Otto 's . It 's 50 ladies in 24 hours . For The Carpenter . 200 K and Kip 's life on the felt . So long now
MITCH: Who was that guy , Sara ? She looks at the door Shrugs
SWAY: Good question
TUMBLER: Freb 's here . Open the gate .
DONNY ASTRICKY: We sent him out on a solo boost . See what he could do
FREB: How do I look in this one ?
MIRROR MAN: Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac .
DONNY ASTRICKY: How 'd it go ?
FREB: Keys were in it
DONNY ASTRICKY: Well , that defies the point , do n't it ?
MIRROR MAN: You should ask him how he got the name `` Freb . ''

MEMPHIS: Stopped by to see Otto . Say hello .
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: What 's this ?
OTTO: Cadillac . ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: What 's wrong with it ?
OTTO: Needs brightening
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Run me down a tag - 329 HRO . Cadillac .
OTTO: No faith in our new-found goodness , Detective ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Sure . But sometimes we got to create some numbers . The task force is run by statistics , you know
MEMPHIS: You 're thinking okay , there 's no want But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up , right ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Something like that -
MEMPHIS: Let her rip And Castlebeck starts the car
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Okay , then . I 'll catch you later , Randall
OTTO: Double-meaning intended , right ?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Right
MEMPHIS: I do n't think so , Detective
HELEN RAINES: The photo album . I get nostalgic around this time of year
MEMPHIS: What time of year ?
HELEN RAINES: Tuesdays
MEMPHIS: You ever wonder what things 'd be like if he had n't died ?
HELEN RAINES: Every day . I wonder about that every day
MEMPHIS: Kip and I 'd probably be working at the dealership Imagine us selling cars ?
HELEN RAINES: And just in case you lose your keys , good sir , I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim , free of charge
MEMPHIS: Mother !
HELEN RAINES: I remember . Supper getting cold , cos you two are out there heads under hoods
MEMPHIS: You remember that , Kip ?
KIP: I was six Memphis and Helen look at him Then
MEMPHIS: After he died I think that 's what I missed most of all That there was no different cars every night When I started hanging around Otto 's And he started showing me the things It was a way to kill two birds Put food on the table for you and Kip And Ride in different cars every night Just like when Dad was here .
KIP: Ancient history 's two things . `` Ancient . '' And `` history ! ''
HELEN RAINES: I know
MEMPHIS: We do it . He 'll get clear Once and for all And she nods
DONNY ASTRICKY: Car-jacking is the lazy man 's boost . No skill . No finesse . Can only take the car if the key is in it . That 's not thieving . That 's parking Thugs With the decency of dirt
TOBY: They 're just cars , man
MEMPHIS: This Eleanor 's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now .
TOBY: Who 's `` Eleanor ? ''
MEMPHIS: The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500 .
TOBY: Why do you call it `` Eleanor ? ''
MEMPHIS: All the vehicles get code names . Female names . You say `` Eleanor lives at such and such `` and no one listening on the waves is the wiser
DONNY ASTRICKY: Eleanor is Memphis ' `` unicorn . ''
MEMPHIS: And there she is
TOBY: It looks just like a regular Mustang
KIP: Do n't go there , Toby
MEMPHIS: She 's not . Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang 's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower But its actual output is closer to 600
TOBY: So she flies -
MEMPHIS: She soars -
DONNY ASTRICKY: Grade-A unicorn
TOBY: What 's a `` unicorn ? ''
DONNY ASTRICKY: Fabled creature . You know - the horse with the horn ? Impossible to capture ? Toby looks blank DONNY ASTRICKY We all got one . The single ca that , no matter how many times you try to boost , something happens Cops show up , car does n't start , owne comes back . It 's voodoo
TOBY: You guys and the car thing , man
MEMPHIS: See you in a few days , Eleanor
MIRROR MAN: And you just stick it in the lock . Hit this little button And
OTTO: We 're dinosaurs , Donny . Pull-up a tar pit Can I try ?
MIRROR MAN: Knock yourself out
TOBY: I logged outside the G.R.A.B . site , ight ? Then I monitored thei incoming outside data requests , ight ? Then I got these ISDN numbers , ight ? Then I tracked them back , ight ? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest , right ? Then I called back see , they think I 'm an insurance company - that 's where it looks like I 'm coming from and they 're sharing stats with this insurance company , right ? So now they 're sharing it with me , right ? They think I 'm looking for stats fo an actuarial conference on auto-theft . So they let me in , right ? Give me all these numbers . But then I do n't leave , ight ? I 'm in . I 've got the key . Now I just go anywhere I want .
MEMPHIS: So what 's in there ?
TOBY: I can tell you who 's gon na be on duty tonight . I can tell you how much gas they 're using monthly . I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between `` FRIENDS '' and `` SEINFELD '' Memphis nods Fairly impressed
KIP: Good work , Toby
FREB: It just ai n't happening
DONNY ASTRICKY: You 'll get the hang of it , kid . You just need to remember one thing -
FREB: What 's that ? Donny smiles
DONNY ASTRICKY: On boost night ? Always take along a good mix tape Donny smiles Freb frowns DONNY ASTRICKY You bring a woman back to you crib for some lovemaking , the song you put on , depends on the woman , the type of lovemaking you intend to do , right ?
FREB: I guess
DONNY ASTRICKY: You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting , you do n't put on Sly Stone or James Brown . You put on Ravel . Rachmaninoff . But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track , you would n't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor . You 'd put on Prince . Or Isaac Hayes . Or , if you really wanted to get after it Miles .
FREB: okay
DONNY ASTRICKY: It 's the same way with cars . Different cars . Different tunes . You ca n't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra . You got ta get urgent . You got ta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV , on that shit . But never , never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car . Could lead to disaster . Got it ?
FREB: Got it
DONNY ASTRICKY: Good .
SWAY: Janis Joplin . Billie Holliday . Ella Fitzgerald
DONNY ASTRICKY: Gender bias
OTTO: I 've missed you , Sara Wayland
SWAY: Good to see ya , Otto
KIP: How ya doing , Sway ?
SWAY: Kip
DONNY ASTRICKY: What do you think about all this ?
SWAY: Stick it in the drawer marked `` Fool 's Errand '' , right ?
DONNY ASTRICKY: That 's my girl
MEMPHIS: That 's Mirror Man And that 's Freb And Tumbler And Toby Fellas , this is Sara Wayland They call her `` Sway . ''
SWAY: Hey -
MEMPHIS: Of course She studies him Nods
SWAY: Good . Just so we understand
DONNY ASTRICKY: Well , well , well . The original crash test dummy
FREB: Who 's that ?
OTTO: That 's The Sphinx .
FREB: The Sphinx ?
OTTO: He never says a word . And he 's got a messed-up nose . Hence . The Sphinx . He 's boo-koo koo-koo . But he steals like time Hello , Sphinxy , old rum !
MEMPHIS: Okay . We 're all here . Today 's Wednesday . D-Day is Friday night That gives us two days to prep We 're going to find the ladies on our list , find out where they live , when they 're home ; that they 're properly insured Let 's get into the vans

MIRROR MAN: Fuck that cracker shit
TUMBLER: I know that one . General Lee , I elieve , was a Dodge Charger
DONNY ASTRICKY: You ever notice how it had a different interior every week ? That bugged me .
MIRROR MAN: Three words Get A Life .
DONNY ASTRICKY: I 'd like the names and addresses of the owners of these 20 cars please
WOMAN: It 'll take me about 15 minutes .
DONNY ASTRICKY: I can wait .
FREB: Okay , okay . What about MAGNUM P.I . ?

SWAY: I do n't know that
KIP: Stumped !
FREB: Thank-God , Sway , you ai n't all freaky- deaky , too But Sway grins
SWAY: How about a Corvette in MAGICIAN ; a Ford pick-up truck in INCREDIZLE HULK , and

SWAY: he walked in THE COURTSHIP OF
DONNY ASTRICKY: Walked like a bastard Skippin ' stones and shit..
OTTO: That 's a good one , Donny
DONNY ASTRICKY: I think so too
MIRROR MAN: Ya 'll really need to get the fuck out of the house more

MEMPHIS: No way
SWAY: No ?
MEMPHIS: No
SWAY: Do n't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me , Randall . I 'm the jane that was left , and you 're the jim that did the leaving . So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes .

JUSTINE: It 's not funny , Phil , this is serious . I 'm gon na go up there tomorrow too . And the next day .
JACK: Justine ? What happened to you ?
JUSTINE: What ?
JACK: I went down to St. Catherine 's to check up on Gwen . I looked all over for you , she was askin ' for you .
JUSTINE: Well , how is she ?
JACK: She was heavin ' up until there was nothin ' left to heave . Doctor said she must 've eaten somethin ' with some kind of parasite in it or somethin ' .
JUSTINE: I bet it was those blackberries .
JACK: They 're gon na keep her in there until she gets better so you 're gon na have to supervise cosmetics .
JUSTINE: Stop it , somebody 's gon na see !
HOLDEN: Who cares , I do n't care . I crave you . I wan na know everything about you . Who are you ?
JUSTINE: I 'm just this woman . I moved to Texas when I was eleven . My daddy was in the Air Force .
HOLDEN: I wan na knock open your head and see what 's inside . I 've had so much pain in my life . I know you have too , I can see it .
JUSTINE: Holden gave me two of his stories to ead . It 's like what a story would be . I was about a boy who was put upon , his mother was cold and selfish , and his father wanted him to play football . Other people did n't get him , especially girls . Then the boy comes to believe no one can ever really know him . So he starts actin ' out , drinkin ' , and doin ' all kinds of drugs . At the end the boy kills himself but jumpin ' ove abridge . The second story was pretty much the same as the first . Except at the end , the boy kills himself by drinkin ' a bottle of bug poison .
HOLDEN: I just wan na leave some kind of legacy . Somethin ' great . After that I do n't care what happens to me .
JUSTINE: Do n't say that . I wish there was a story about me . I do n't know who would read it though .
HOLDEN: I would .
JUSTINE: I like this . I like havin ' a secret . You gave me a secret Holden .
HOLDEN: Seee , now that you met me you 're mysterious . And dark and twisted .
JUSTINE: I 'm going to hell , are n't I ?
HOLDEN: Yes , you are . hr
JUSTINE: That 's Bubba 's truck . Get in the car . Phil takes that truck to work everyday . Bubba picks him up , and drops him off . Why , why would that truck be parked there ?
HOLDEN: I do n't know .
JUSTINE: If he finds out about us .
HOLDEN: I wo n't let him hurt you .
JUSTINE: He 's big , Holden . He 'll kill you . He 'll eat me , but he 'll kill you .
HOLDEN: You ca n't worry about somethin ' that has n't even happened yet .
JUSTINE: I got ta go to the hospital .
HOLDEN: Okay .
JUSTINE: Do n't ! I mean he could be followin ' us .
CORNY: Justine ! Poor lady . She just passed .
JUSTINE: Who ?
CORNY: Gwen ! She just passed away .
JUSTINE: What do you mean ? I thought she had a stomach ache ?
CORNY: It got worse . She was on life support all day .
JUSTINE: I do n't understand .
CORNY: It 's God 's will , Justine . No one can understand it . It was just Gwen 's time to fly away home .
JUSTINE: Gwen died today .
PHIL: What ? Are you kiddin ? What for ?
JUSTINE: Parasite . Somethin ' she ate .
PHIL: You okay ?
JUSTINE: Where were you this afternoon ?
PHIL: Paintin ' on Bovery . Why ?
JUSTINE: What time did Bubba bring you home ?
PHIL: We knocked off early 'bout four . Bubba had a date with a stewardess , why ?
JUSTINE: Oh . I ca n't believe she 's dead . I was n't a very good friend to her .
PHIL: Do n't say that , Teeny . 'Course you were . 'Course you were .
JACK: Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack Fields , your store manager . Before we open today , I just want to share some terrible and shocking news . One of ou est employees , Gwen Jackson , died yesterday . Gwen was a real class act . She had a good attitude , she had ideas . We 're all gon na miss her . Now , if any of y'all need to collect you thoughts and remembe Gwen . GWEN , then today 's the day . You 'll e excused from work and we 'll just have to do without you . Gwen , this one 's for you .
JUSTINE: Holden had the notion to go to Gabler 's Creek , skinny dippin ' and makin ' love . He said we 'd be like Adam and Eve , rollin ' around around in the sticks and the dirt and bein ' one with nature . He was so fixed on the idea thateven when the clouds started rollin ' in , and the sky was gettin ; dark , he kept on swimmin ' . All my thoughts turned to death . I thought of Gwen 's body , rottin ' away . I thought of how nice a person she was , so full of life and good will . If there was a heaven , Gwen would be there . Givin ' makeovers and offerin ' up helpful advice . I thought if I died today , what would happen to me ? A hateful girl . A selfish girl . An adultress . A liar .
HOLDEN: Makin ' one out of two .
JUSTINE: I have n't thought this through .
HOLDEN: Justine , will you leave him ?
JUSTINE: And go where ?
HOLDEN: Away . With you on my arm , my folks 'll think I 've changed . They 'll stop thinkin ' I 'm suck a loner , I got a girlfriend , a pretty one , who knows me and likes me . And they 'll be so happy , they 'll give me money to write my novel .
JUSTINE: But where will we GO ?
HOLDEN: We 'll be like Catcher in the Rye . Only by me . I 'll be immortal and then like JD Salinger I 'll just vanish .

JACK: Hey Justine . How you holding up ?

HOLDEN: I 'm starting to wonder if you even want to go . I 'm startin ' to think you do n't get me .
JUSTINE: Well , maybe I do n't get you .
HOLDEN: You do , you do get me you just do n't want to me 'cause I 'm too intensified for you ! Justine , who cares , who cares if someone finds out . We do n't have to live like this , Justine . I know what it 's like to go home every night and feel like you 're hidin ' out . We can leave all this behind

JUSTINE: Thanks . hr
BUBBA: Easy Bitz , easy Bitz . Back in your corner ! Back in your corner ! Back in your corner , Bitz ! Come on in . I wan na show you somethin ' . Sit . I 'm in shock .
JUSTINE: Why ?
BUBBA: You know why .
JUSTINE: Bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak . Finally , when he opened his mouth , he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life . He talked about how he loved Phil , and how he loved me . And how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me , and to be a guy like Phil , to this imaginary girl like me , that he never found . Then he wen on about givin ' up your dreams and how it 's all a part of gettin ' older . Bubba had given up on his dream to be like Phil , and accepted his fate as Bubba , always and forever . Then , last week , a door that emained shut swung wide open . Bubba thought this no chance coincidence , a cosmic force was at work . The sounds of me makin ' love to a man that was n't Phil was like a shout in Bubba 's ea from the creator himself . What it meant , or what to do , or why Bubba did n't know . All he knew was that he hated me fo poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long . I was no longer Bubba 's image of perfection . To him I was just a liar , and a whore , and that sickened him . But on the othe hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to Phil . Phil was no superman , just a cuckhold , and a foll , and that was beautiful . Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do . Something that would solve oth our problems and end this whole tragic cycle .
BUBBA: But do n't you see ? This is my chance , for liberation .
JUSTINE: But , one person 's liberation is anothe person 's , well , badness . There 's just no way .
BUBBA: I 'm gon na have to tell Phil then .
JUSTINE: Why ?
BUBBA: He 's my best friend . I ca n't keep him in the dark about somethin ' this big . He 's a cuckhold .
JUSTINE: You wan na cuckhold him yourself !
BUBBA: Well that 's different . That is n't about him . That 's about my salvation . Look , you 've got your choice to make . Eithe destroy your marriage , and break you husband 's heart . Or have sex with me ight now .
JUSTINE: Oh god ! There was someone in the window ! Did you not see ?
BUBBA: You 're paranoid .
JUSTINE: I got ta go .
BUBBA: Phil is never gon na find out about any of this . Do n't fret .
JUSTINE: Get this damn dog away from me ! hr
BUBBA: You 're lookin ' at a free man , Justine . A free man .
JUSTINE: Great . Good for you .
BUBBA: Thank you .
PHIL: I 'm nervous .
JUSTINE: You 're nervous ? Why ?
PHIL: 'Cause I got ta go to that doctor tomorrow and jism into a cup , that 's why . What if I ca n't do it ?
JUSTINE: You can do it .
PHIL: You know , If you said you 'd help me I 'd feel alot less nervous . It 's gon na e on your lunch hour anyway .
JUSTINE: Okay .
PHIL: You did n't even say nothing about the TV bein ' fixed .
JUSTINE: Oh . Is it ? Thanks .
PHIL: You 're welcome . hr
JACK: Well are n't you a fright ? Justine , you talked to Holden lately ? He did n't show up for work today , I wan na know what gives . I know you two are friends .
JUSTINE: We 're not friends .
JACK: You eat lunch together every day .

JUSTINE: No , Holden , this is all because of you . He had me over a barrel . If I did n't sleep with him he was gon na tell Phil about us !
HOLDEN: I 'm so alone !
JUSTINE: You 've got ta get a hold of yourself ! Are you drunk ?
HOLDEN: Yes , I 'm drunk ! And I 'll be drunk every day until the day I die ! What do you care ? ! You jump on any pecker that 's put in front of you !
JUSTINE: It 's not what you think .
HOLDEN: I saw everything . Oh god . Oh god .

HOLDEN: Where you goin ' ?
JUSTINE: I got ta help Phil with his sperm .

NURSE: Mr. Last ? Would you come with me ?
PHIL: Wish me luck .
JUSTINE: Good luck , honey .
BUBBA: Knock 'em dead , partner . You look nice .
JUSTINE: No , I do n't .

JUSTINE: What ? No hr
HOLDEN: You know , sometimes , I think to myself , at least it ca n't get any worse . But it can . I can worse . As long as you can say you 've hit rock bottom you can .
JUSTINE: Oh my god , Blackberries .
HOLDEN: A blind man can go deaf . A widow can lose her children . Babies starve and they never get food . They never get any food . They just come into the world and they die .
JUSTINE: Calm down , Holden !
HOLDEN: I ca n't calm down ! I 'd be easy if I was a hooker like you . I could calm down all over town .
JUSTINE: Hey , hey ! I am not a hooker .
HOLDEN: I know you 're not . I 'm in agony .
JUSTINE: Why ?
HOLDEN: What do you mean 'why ' ? I thought you hated your life .
JUSTINE: I do . I mean I 'm depressed but You are really depressed .
HOLDEN: I 'll kill him . I 'll murder him in his sleep . I 'll kill my parents , I 'll steal the money whatever it takes . You just , just whatever you want as long as it 's you and me . Please do n't forsake me Justine .
JUSTINE: Oh I , I promise .

PHIL: Looks like that wind 's pickin ' up again .
JUSTINE: How it all came down to this , only the devil knows . Retail Rodeo was at the corner on my left , the motel was down the road to my right . I closed my eyes and tried to peer into the future . On my left I saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks . Dirty looks and quiet whisperings . and burning secrets that wo n't ever die away . And on my ight , what could I picture ? The blue sky , the desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity . A beautiful , never ending nothing .
CHERYL: Hey Justine .
JUSTINE: I know where you can find him .
JACK: Holden ?
JUSTINE: He 's at the Hotel Glen Capri , and he 'll e there till noon .
JACK: You done good . You 're a good girl .

PHIL: I thought we were robbed . Why are n't you at work ?
JUSTINE: They gave me the day off .
PHIL: Retail Rodeo ? You know that guy ?
JUSTINE: No . hr
JACK: Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck Fields , your store manager . As most of you all know by now , We lost another employee yesterday . Holden was a thief and a disturbed young man , and what happened was a sad thing . Perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy , like do n't steal and do n't be disturbed . The important is to move on . Like dozens of those who quit . This one 's for you Holden .
CHERYL: I thought we were gon na get a day off and go to the movies .
JUSTINE: What ?

JUSTINE: You 're the only man alive that I love .
PHIL: Oh god . Please do n't tell me it 's not my baby .
JUSTINE: It 's your baby .
PHIL: Are you sure ?
JUSTINE: It is . I swear . I swear to God .
PHIL: Who is he ?
JUSTINE: It does n't matter .
PHIL: Yes , it does . Was it some guy from work ?
JUSTINE: Yes .
PHIL: Yeah , I know who it was . It was that Bible guy , was n't it ? The Nazarine . That 's why you were actin ' so spooked .
JUSTINE: Yeah , yeah .
PHIL: I 'm gon na beat his ass .

CHERYL: Fake eyelashes . Extra long .
JUSTINE: Just do it normal for once ?
CHERYL: You want me to make the other cheek purple to even it out ?
JUSTINE: No .
CHERYL: D'you hear about Corny ? He was goin ' home after Bible study last night and two beefy guys with painted faces pulled up in a truck and jumped him .
JUSTINE: That 's terrible .
CHUCKIE: Oh my God , I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin ' to tell you .

'' Mikey 's like `` I 'm sorry '' BANG '' I hit your cat with my truck , and I 'm just trying to put it out of it 's misery '' BANG ! And the cat dies . So Mikey 's like `` Why do n't you come look at the front of the truck . '' 'Cause the other guy 's all fuckin flipped out about
WILL: Watching his cat get brained .
CHUCKIE: Yeah , so he 's like `` Check the front of my truck , I can prove I hit it 'cause there 's probably some blood or something ''
WILL: or a tail
MORGAN: WILL !
CHUCKIE: And so they go around to the front of his truck and there 's anothe cat on the grille .

LAMBEAU: Well I 'll be speaking to you supervisor .
MORGAN: What happened ? You got fired , huh ?
WILL: Yeah , Morgan . I got fired .
MORGAN: How fuckin ' retarded do you have to e to get shit-canned from that job ? How hard is it to push a fuckin ' oom ?
CHUCKIE: You got fired from pushing a broom , you little bitch .
MORGAN: Yah , that was different . Management was restructurin '
BILLY: Yah , restructurin ' the amount of etards they had workin ' for them .
MORGAN: Fuck you , you fat fuck .
BILLY: Least I work for a livin ' . Why 'd you get fired ?
WILL: Management was restructurin ' . Laughter .
CHUCKIE: My uncle can probably get you on my demo team .
MORGAN: What the fuck ? I just asked you fo a job yesterday !
CHUCKIE: I told you `` no '' yesterday !
ALL: What 's up Case .
CASEY: ID ?
CHUCKIE: So , this is a Harvard bar , huh ? I thought there 'd be equations and shit on the wall .
LYDIA: Fine .
SKYLAR: Okay .
CHUCKIE: So , you ladies ah , go to school here ?
LYDIA: Yes .
CHUCKIE: Yeah , cause I think I had a class with you .
SKYLAR: What class ?
CHUCKIE: Ah , history I think .
SKYLAR: Oh
CHUCKIE: Yah , it 's not a bad school
CLARK: What class did you say that was ?
CHUCKIE: History .
CLARK: How 'd you like that course ?
CHUCKIE: Good , it was all right .
CLARK: History ? Just `` history ? '' It must have been a survey course then .
CHUCKIE: Hey , come on pal we 're in classes all day . That 's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me , everybody 's talkin ' about school all the time .
CLARK: Hey , I 'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar . But as long as you 're here I want to `` seize '' the opportunity to ask you a question .
CHUCKIE: To tell you the truth , I was n't there much . The class was rather elementary .
CLARK: Elementary ? Oh , I do n't doubt that it was . I remember the class , it was just between recess and lunch .
CHUCKIE: All right , are we gon na have a problem ?
CLARK: There 's no problem . I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies . My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist and
WILL: Of course that 's your contention . You 're a first year grad student . You just finished some Marxian historian , Pete Garrison prob'ly , and so naturally that 's what you elieve until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740 . That 'll last until sometime in your second year , then you 'll be in here egurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization .
CLARK: Well , as a matter of fact , I wo n't , ecause Wood drastically underestimates the impact of
WILL: `` Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth , especially inherited wealth '' You got that from `` Work in Essex County , '' Page 421 , right ? Do you have any thoughts of your own on the subject or were you just gon na plagiarize the whole ook for me ? Clark is stunned .
CLARK: Yeah ? What 're those ?
WILL: One , do n't do that . Two you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda ' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library . Will catches Skylar 's eye .
CLARK: But I will have a degree , and you 'll e serving my kids fries at a drive through on our way to a skiing trip .
WILL: Maybe . But at least I wo n't be a prick . And if you got a problem with that , I guess we can step outside and deal with it that way .
MORGAN: My boy 's wicked smart .
SKYLAR: You suck .
WILL: What ?
SKYLAR: I 've been sitting over there fo forty-five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me . But I 'm just tired now and I have to go home and I was n't going to keep sitting there waiting for you .
WILL: I 'm Will .
SKYLAR: Skylar . And by the way . That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he did n't come with us .
WILL: I kind of got that impression .
SKYLAR: Well , look , I have to go . Got ta ' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education .
WILL: I did n't mean you . Listen , maybe
SKYLAR: Here 's my number .
WILL: Great , or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels .
SKYLAR: What ?
WILL: When you think about it , it 's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee .
SKYLAR: Okay , sounds good . She turns .
WILL: Five minutes .
SKYLAR: What ?
WILL: I was trying to be smooth . But at twelve-fifteen I was gon na come over there and talk to you .
SKYLAR: See , it 's my life story . Five more minutes and I would have got to hea your best pick-up line .
WILL: The caramel thing is my pick-up line . A beat .
SKYLAR: Glad I came over .
MORGAN: There goes that fuckin ' Barney right now , with his fuckin ' `` skiin ' trip . '' We should ' a kicked that dude 's ass .
WILL: Hold up .
CLARK: Yeah ?
LAMBEAU: Excuse me . Is this the buildings and grounds office ?
TERRY: Yeah , can I help you ?
LAMBEAU: I 'm trying to find the name of a student who works here .
TERRY: No students work for me .
LAMBEAU: Could you just check , because the young man who works in my building
TERRY: Which one 's your building ?
LAMBEAU: Building two .
TERRY: Well , if something was stolen , I should know about it .
LAMBEAU: No , no . Nothing like that . I just need his name .
TERRY: I ca n't give you his name unless you have a complaint .
LAMBEAU: Please , I 'm a professor here and it 's very important .
TERRY: Well , he did n't show up for work today Terry takes a beat . Holding all the cards .
WILL: There is a lengthy legal precedent , Your Honor , going back to 1789 , whereby a defendant may claim self- defense against an agent of the government where the act is shown to e a defense against tyranny , a defense of liberty
JUDGE MALONE: Mr. Simmons , Officer McNeely who signed the complaint is n't in my courtroom . Why is that ?
PROSECUTOR: He 's in the hospital with a broken knee , Your Honor . But I have depositions from the other officers .
WILL: Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed , in his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit ack in 1887 , that `` Every American citizen is by birth , a sworn office of the state . Every man is a policeman . '' As for the other officers , even William Congrave said ; `` he that first cries out 'stop thief ' is 'oft he that has stolen the treasure . ''
PROSECUTOR: Your Honor Will cranks it up .
WILL: I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense by our constitution , Sir . The same document which guarantees my right to liberty . `` Liberty , '' in case you 've forgotten , is `` the soul 's right to breathe , and when it can not take a long breath laws are girded too tight . Without liberty , man is a syncope . '' Ibid . Your Honor .
PROSECUTOR: Man is a what ?
WILL: Julius Caesar proclaimed Though he be wounded `` Magna '' The Judge interrupts .
JUDGE MALONE: Son , My turn . The Judge opens Will 's CASE HISTORY .
LAMBEAU: Excuse me , your Honor . Gerald Lambeau .
JUDGE MALONE: Oh . Pleased to meet you .
LAMBEAU: Do you have a minute ?
GUARD: One call , to an attorney . One .
WILL: How many ? Will picks up the phone , dials .
SKYLAR: Yeah ?
WILL: It 's Will , the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar ?
SKYLAR: I 'm sorry , I do n't recall meeting anyone who fits that description .
WILL: Okay , you got me . It 's the ugly , obnoxious , toothless loser who got drunk and would n't leave you alone all night .
SKYLAR: Oh Will ! I was wondering when you 'd call .
WILL: Yeah , I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels .
SKYLAR: Sounds good , where are you now ?
WILL: You are n't , by any chance , Pre-law ? Are you ?
LAMBEAU: Hello . Gerald Lambeau , M.I.T .
WILL: Fuck do you want ?
LAMBEAU: I 've spoken with the judge and he 's agreed to release you under my supervision .
WILL: Really ?
LAMBEAU: Yes . Under two conditions .
WILL: What 're those ?
LAMBEAU: That you meet with me twice a week— and you meet with a therapist .
WILL: If I agree to this , I walk right now ?
LAMBEAU: That 's right .
WILL: I 'll do the work . I 'm not going to meet with a therapist .
LAMBEAU: Now , it wo n't be as bad as it sounds , Will . I 've already spoken to one therapist , his name is Henry Lipkin and he 's a friend of mine . He 's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field . I 'm sure it 'll be better than spending the next six months in jail .
BILLY: Submit , bitch ! Submit ! Submit !
MORGAN: Suck my cock !
BILLY: Oh , Morgan !
CHUCKIE: What 'd you get ? You get leniency ?
WILL: Probation , counselin ' , few days a week .
CHUCKIE: You 're fuckin ' good . Will smiles .
MORGAN: Fuck your mother too !
WILL: That 's why I love stock-car racin ' . That Dale Ernhart 's real good .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Now you know Will , and I know , what you need to be doing . You have a gift .
WILL: I could work the pit maybe , but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart
PSYCHOLOGIST: You have a quality something you were born with , that you have no control over and you are , in a sense , hiding that by becoming a janitor . And I 'm not saying that 's wrong . I 'm friends with the janito that works in my building . He 's een to my house for dinner . As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for `` Mike '' that 's not his real name . That 's in my book .
WILL: Yeah , I read your book . `` Mike '' had the same problems as `` Chad '' the stockbroker .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Yes . The pressures you feel , and again , I am neither labeling no judging them , are keeping you from fulfilling your potential you 're in a rut . So stop the Tom Foolery the Shenanigan 's , Will .
WILL: You 're right . I know .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Will , your not getting off that easy .
WILL: No , but , I mean you know I do other things . That no one knows about .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Like what , Will ?
WILL: I go places , I interact .
PSYCHOLOGIST: What places ?
WILL: Certain , clubs . Like , Paradise . It 's not bad . Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look .
PSYCHOLOGIST: I might understand that .
WILL: Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you 're gay ?
PSYCHOLOGIST: What ?
WILL: C'mon , I read your book . I talked to you . It 's just something I know to e true .
PSYCHOLOGIST: That 's very presumptuous .
WILL: Buddy , two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Well , I 'm sorry to disappoint you , ut I 'm married and I have two children .
WILL: I 'm sure you do . You probably got a eal nice house , nice car you ook 's a best seller .
PSYCHOLOGIST: You 're getting defensive , Will .
WILL: Look , man . I do n't care if you 're putting from the rough . There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay ; Alexander the Great , Caesar , Shakespeare , Oscar Wilde , Napoleon , Gertrude Stein , not to mention Danny Terrio , not many straight men can dance like that .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Who is `` Danny Terrio ? ''
WILL: If you wan na hit `` Ramrod , '' take you shot . Take some pride in it . You go to church ? So fuckin ' what , God loves you . I mean , Christ . A guy as well known as you ? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like `` Inspector Clouseau . '' The Psychologist calmly packs his things .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Well , I can see this is pointless
WILL: You 're getting defensive Henry . And hey , chief tell the wife , at least . Christ , set her free . The shrink gets up and walks out .
LAMBEAU: Henry ? The Psychologist keeps walking .
PSYCHOLOGIST: No . You know what , Gerry ? This is why I do n't do pro-bono anymore . It 's not worth it to me .
LAMBEAU: What happened ?
PSYCHOLOGIST: I do n't have the time . I 'm going on national television this week .
LAMBEAU: Wait a minute , Henry
WILL: Of course .
LAMBEAU: Okay . How ?
WILL: It 's an integer proof . Lambeau smiles .
LAMBEAU: That would be a monumental waste of time , would n't it , Will ?
WILL: I think so .
LAMBEAU: I happen to know so . Lambeau rises and goes to the board .
WILL: You color-code it . Half-red , half- lack . If that 's an integer Lambeau steps in , writing with him .
LAMBEAU: What 's that ?
WILL: Half-red , half-black
LAMBEAU: that ?
WILL: Half-red , half-black
LAMBEAU: That edge !
WILL: An integer .
LAMBEAU: It would appear we got that proof in under the wire after all . It 's not how hard you look at things , young man , it 's the way you look at them . If you take aim before you fire , you will find the most difficult problems ecome , quite literally , child 's play . Will gets his coat .
WILL: Yeah , when do I get my hypnosis ? You guys been talkin ' for twenty minutes .
HYPNOTIST: Yes , Will . We 'll get to that . But first , why do n't you go to sleep fo me .
WILL: Seven .
HYPNOTIST: And what do you see ?
WILL: Somethin 's in my room .
HYPNOTIST: What is it ?
WILL: It 's like a small figure , hoverin ' over me . Gettin ' closer . Will flinches .
HYPNOTIST: You 're in a safe place , Will .
WILL: It 's touching me .
HYPNOTIST: Where is it touching you ?
WILL: Down there . And I 'm nervous .
HYPNOTIST: You do n't have to be nervous , Will .
WILL: 'Cause I 'm not ready . But the figure tells me everything 's gon na be all right . 'Cause the figure 's a Libra too . And we start dancin ' and it 's beautiful Will breaks into song at full volume .
LAMBEAU: Oh Jesus .
HYPNOTIST: I have better ways to spend my time . He is gone . Will stops singing , laughs .
LAMBEAU: Oh , for God 's sake , Will .
WILL: Oh , come on ! You 're not pinnin ' this one on me . He left , I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes . I was havin ' fun .
LAMBEAU: I told you to cooperate with these people .
WILL: C'mon , that guy was a fuckin ' piece of work .
LAMBEAU: Get out , Will .
WILL: Okay do n't forget to get anothe therapist for next week .
LAMBEAU: That 's enough . Will is out the door . Lambeau turns to Tom .
TOM: I called Mel Weintraub this morning , to check for availability .
LAMBEAU: What 's the point ?
TOM: What do you want to do ?
LAMBEAU: There is somebody
TOM: Who is he ?
LAMBEAU: He was my roommate in college .
SEAN: Establishing trust is the most important component in making eakthroughs with a patient . Why ? A beat .
VINNIE: Because trust is an important thing .
SEAN: Do n't bullshit me , Vinnie . Did n't your brother give you the notes ? Okay . If a patient does n't trust you then they wo n't feel safe enough to e honest with you then there 's no point to them being in therapy . It 's like saying `` Fine , come here and do n't tell me a thing but go home feeling like you 're doing something about your problems and give me my fifty bucks before you leave will ya ' ! ''
LAMBEAU: Sean .
SEAN: Well , it seems we 're in the presence of greatness . Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field 's Medal winner . Combunatorial Mathematics . 1986 . The students stare blankly .
LAMBEAU: Hello .
SEAN: The Field 's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math . But it 's only given out every fou years . A beat .
LAMBEAU: Good to see you .
SEAN: Good to see you .
LAMBEAU: Is there someplace we can talk ?
SKYLAR: I do n't know , it was just kind of the boring suburban thing . Private school , Harvard , and now Med . School . I actually figured out that at the end of it , my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars . I should n't have told you that
WILL: I bet your parents were happy to pay .
SKYLAR: I was happy to pay . I inherited the money .
WILL: Is Harvard gettin ' all that money ?
SKYLAR: Stanford . I 'm leaving in June afte I graduate .
WILL: So you just want to use me and go ?
SKYLAR: Well , I 'm gon na experiment on you for my anatomy class , then go .
WILL: In that case , fine . Want to see my magic trick ?
SKYLAR: Sure .
WILL: Now , I 'm gon na make all these caramels disappear .
SKYLAR: Okay
WILL: It works better when I have my rabbit .
LAMBEAU: I did n't see you at the reunion .
SEAN: I 've been busy .
LAMBEAU: You were missed . How long has it been since we 've seen each other ?
SEAN: Since Nancy died .
LAMBEAU: I 'm sorry , that damn conference
SEAN: I got your card .
SKYLAR: Have you ever seen Annie Hall ?
WILL: No .
SKYLAR: Well , there 's this part of the movie that 's about how there 's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what 's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss ' thing . Will smiles .
WILL: I really do n't 'date ' that much .
SKYLAR: You know what I mean . I know you 've at least thought about it .
WILL: No I have n't
SKYLAR: Yes you have . You were thinking you were gon na get a good night kiss .
WILL: No I was n't
SKYLAR: Yes you were .
WILL: I was kinda ' hopin ' to get a `` good night laid '' but I 'll take a kiss . She laughs .
SKYLAR: Oh , you will ?
WILL: No I was hoping to get a kiss .
SKYLAR: Then why do n't we just get it out of the way . He looks at her .
WILL: Now ?
SKYLAR: Yeah .
WILL: Hey , look lady , I 'm just here fo the free food . She smiles .
SKYLAR: Free ?
WILL: Hey , I spent all my money on those caramels . She laughs .
SEAN: I 've been busy , Gerry . I got a full schedule .
LAMBEAU: This kid 's special , Sean . I 've neve seen anything like him .
SEAN: Not much free time , Gerry .
LAMBEAU: Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan ? Sean nods his head .
SEAN: Yeah .
LAMBEAU: He was alive over a hundred years ago . He was Indian . Dots , not feathers Sean finishes the joke . Lambeau chuckles .
SEAN: And he mailed it to Hardy
LAMBEAU: That 's right , Sean . He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England .
SEAN: Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age
LAMBEAU: They worked together for the remainde of their lives , producing some of the most exciting math theory eve done . Ramanujan 's genius was unparalleled , Sean . This boy is like that . But he 's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him .
SEAN: Why me ?
LAMBEAU: I need someone with your kind of ackground .
SEAN: My kind of background ?
LAMBEAU: You 're from the same neighborhood . South Boston .
SEAN: He 's from Southie ? How many people did you try before you came to me ?
LAMBEAU: Five . Sean gives a slight , knowing smile .
SEAN: Who ? Barry , Henry , Rick Lambeau nods .
LAMBEAU: Just meet with the boy once a week .
SEAN: Can we do it at my office ?
LAMBEAU: That would be fine .
SEAN: I got it .
LAMBEAU: It 's on the college . Sean relents .
SEAN: I 'll be okay .
LAMBEAU: It 's a poker game with this young man . Do n't let him see what you 've got .
WILL: No .
LAMBEAU: Will , this is Sean Maguire . Sean , Will Hunting .
WILL: Yeah , let 's let the healing begin .
SEAN: Would you excuse us ?
LAMBEAU: Tom .
SEAN: You too , Gerry .
WILL: Did you buy all these books retail , or do you send away for like a `` shrink kit '' that comes with all these volumes included ?
SEAN: Have you read all these books , Will ?
WILL: Probably not .
SEAN: How about the ones on that shelf ?
WILL: Yeah , I read those .
SEAN: What did you think ?
WILL: I 'm not here for a fuckin ' book eport . They 're your books , why do n't you read 'em ?
SEAN: I did .
WILL: That must have taken you a long time .
SEAN: Yeah , it did take me a long time .
WILL: `` A History of the United States , Volume I . '' If you want to read a eal history book , read Howard Zinn 's `` A People 's History of the United States . '' That book will knock you on your ass .
SEAN: How about Noam Chomsky 's `` Manufacturing Consent ? ''
WILL: You people baffle me . You spend all this money on beautiful , fancy books and they 're the wrong fuckin ' books .
SEAN: You think so ?
WILL: Whatever blows your hair back . Will returns to his chair . Pause .
SEAN: Guy your age should n't smoke so much . Stunt your growth .
WILL: You 're right . It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing .
SEAN: Yes , I do .
WILL: Nautilus ?
SEAN: Free weights .
WILL: Oh yeah ? Me too . What do you bench ?
SEAN: 285 .
WILL: Oh .
SEAN: Yeah . Do you paint ?
WILL: No .
SEAN: Crayons ?
WILL: This is a real piece of shit .
SEAN: Tell me what you really think .
WILL: Poor color composition , lousy use of space . But that shit does n't really concern me .
SEAN: What does ?
WILL: The color here , see how dark it is ? It 's interesting .
SEAN: What is ?
WILL: I think you 're one step away from cutting your ear off .
SEAN: Oh , `` Starry Night '' time , huh ?
WILL: You ever heard the saying , `` any port in a storm ? ''
SEAN: Sure , how 'bout `` still waters run deep '' -
WILL: Well , maybe that means you .
SEAN: Maybe what mea
WILL: Maybe you were in the middle of a storm , a big fuckin ' storm the waves were crashing over the bow , the Goddamned mast was about to snap , and you were crying for the harbor . So you did what you had to do , to get out . Maybe you became a psychologist .
SEAN: Maybe you should be a patient and sit down .
WILL: Maybe you married the wrong woman .
SEAN: Watch your mouth .
WILL: That 's it is n't it ? You married the wrong woman . She leave you ? Was she angin ' someone else ? Sean is walking slowly towards Will .
SEAN: If you ever disrespect my wife again I will end you .
WILL: Time 's up .
LAMBEAU: Five minutes , Sean . Are you okay ? A pause , Sean is staring at his painting .
SEAN: Thursday , four o'clock . Make sure the kid is here .
SKYLAR: You grew up around here ?
WILL: Not far from here , South Boston .
SKYLAR: How was that ?
WILL: Pretty boring , I guess . She smiles .
SKYLAR: I bet you have a great family .
WILL: You know , nothing special .
SKYLAR: You have a lot of brothers and sisters ?
WILL: Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters ?
SKYLAR: Yeah .
WILL: Well , Irish Catholic . What do you think ?
SKYLAR: How many ?
WILL: You would n't believe me if I told you .
SKYLAR: What , five ? Will shakes his head .
WILL: I have twelve big brothers .
SKYLAR: Not a chance .
WILL: Yup , you 're lookin ' at lucky thirteen .
SKYLAR: Bullshit .
WILL: I swear to God .
SKYLAR: Your house must have been a zoo .
WILL: It was great . There was always someone to play with , give you advice .
SKYLAR: Do you know all their names ?
WILL: 'Course I do , they 're my brothers .
SKYLAR: Well
WILL: Marky , Ricky , Danny , Terry , Mikey , Davey , Timmy , Tommy , Joey , Robby , Johnny , and Brian .
SKYLAR: Do you keep in touch with them ?
WILL: All the time . We all live in Southie . I live with three of them now . Skylar smiles .
SKYLAR: I want to meet them .
WILL: We 'll do that .
SEAN: Come with me .
WILL: So what 's with this place ? You have a swan fetish ? Is this something you 'd like to talk about ?
SEAN: I was thinking about what you said to me the other day , about my painting . I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occurred to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and have n't thought about you since . You know what occurred to me ?
WILL: No .
SEAN: You 're just a boy . You do n't have the faintest idea what you 're talking about .
WILL: Why thank you .
SEAN: You 've never been out of Boston .
WILL: No .
SEAN: So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written Michelangelo ? You know a lot about him I bet . Life 's work , criticisms , political aspirations . But you could n't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel . You 've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling . And if I asked you about women I 'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites , and maybe you 've been laid a few times too . But you could n't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy . If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material , ut you 've never been in one . You 've never held your best friend 's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath , looking to you for help . And if I asked you about love I 'd get a sonnet , but you 've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable . Known that someone could kill you with a look . That someone could rescue you from grief . That God had put an angel on Earth just for you . And you would n't know how it felt to be her angel . To have the love be there for her forever . Through anything , through cancer . You would n't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term `` visiting hours '' did n't apply to you . And you would n't know about real loss , because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself , and you 've never dared to love anything that much . I look at you and I do n't see an intelligent confident man , I do n't see a peer , and I do n't see my equal . I see a boy . Nobody could possibly understand you , right Will ? Yet you presume to know so much about me ecause of a painting you saw . You must know everything about me . You 're an orphan , right ? Will nods quietly .
SKYLAR: Hello ?
CHUCKIE: Who 'd you call ?
WILL: No one . I did n't have the number .
MORGAN: What are you , retarded ? You went all the way out there in the rain and you did n't have the number ?
WILL: No , it was your mother 's 900 number . I just ran out of quarters . Laughter . Chuckie pulls away from the curb .
MORGAN: Why do n't we get off mothers , I just got off yours .
BILLY: You 're a pretty funny guy . Here , have a nickel .
MORGAN: Keep fuckin ' with me . Watch what happens .
BILLY: All right , then .
MORGAN: Watch what happens .
SEAN: No smoking .
LAMBEAU: What do you mean `` he did n't talk ? '' You sat there for an hour ?
SEAN: No , he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over . It was pretty impressive , actually .
LAMBEAU: Why would he do that ?
SEAN: To show me he does n't have to talk to me if he does n't want to .
LAMBEAU: Oh , what is this ? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the `` old neighborhood ? ''
SEAN: I wo n't talk first .
KRYSTYN: Hi , Will .
WILL: How you doin ' , Krystyn .
CHUCKIE: I did n't get on Cathy last night .
WILL: Why not ?
CHUCKIE: I do n't know .
CATHY: Fuck you and your Irish curse , Chuckie !
CHUCKIE: She 's missin ' teeth , Will . Will nods , not really into it tonight .
WILL: I 'm takin ' off .
ALL: We 're goin ' late night .
WILL: I 'm tired .
SEAN: You 've never been on a plane .
WILL: I know , but the joke 's better if I tell it in the first person . A beat .
SEAN: Yeah ? You got a lady now ?
WILL: Yeah , I went on a date last week .
SEAN: How 'd it go ?
WILL: Fine .
SEAN: Well , are you going out again ?
WILL: I do n't know .
SEAN: Why not ?
WILL: Have n't called her .
SEAN: Jesus Christ , you are an amateur .
WILL: I know what I 'm doing . She 's different from the other girls I met . We have a really good time . She 's smart , eautiful , fun
SEAN: So Christ , call her up .
WILL: Why ? So I can realize she 's not so smart . That she 's boring . You do n't get it . Right now she 's perfect , I do n't want to ruin that .
SEAN: And right now you 're perfect too . Maybe you do n't want to ruin that . Will says nothing .
WILL: Why not ? You told me every othe fuckin ' thing . You talk more than any shrink I ever met . Sean laughs .
SEAN: I teach this shit , I did n't say I knew how to do it .
WILL: You ever think about gettin ' emarried ?
SEAN: My wife 's dead .
WILL: Hence , the word remarried .
SEAN: My wife 's dead .
WILL: Well I think that 's a wonderful philosophy , Sean . That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone . A beat . Sean smiles .
SEAN: Time 's up .
SKYLAR: Where have you been ?
WILL: I 'm sorry , I been real busy .
SKYLAR: You were busy ? You know , I really was waiting for you to call me .
WILL: Sorry . I 'm sorry . Give me anothe crack at it . Let me take you out .
SKYLAR: You should have called . I have an `` O- chem '' lab due tomorrow and it 's impossible . It 's not an excuse dummy . I want to go out with you . But look She holds up her Lab . Will glances at it .
WILL: Promise ?
SKYLAR: If you bring the caramels . Will smiles .
WILL: I could n't wait till tomorrow .
SKYLAR: How the hell did you do that ?
WILL: Did n't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse in the mouth ?
SKYLAR: I 'm supposed to understand this .
WILL: You 're not going into surgery tomorrow are you ?
SKYLAR: No .
WILL: Then let 's go have some fun . With a smile , she relents .
SEAN: Really ? How 'd the date go ?
WILL: Do you still counsel veterans ? I read your book last night .
SEAN: No , I do n't .
WILL: Why not ?
SEAN: I gave that up when my wife got sick .
WILL: Is that why you did n't write anything else ?
SEAN: I did n't write anything else 'cause nobody , including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one .
WILL: Well , I 've read you colleagues . You ook was good , Sean . All those guys were in your platoon ?
SEAN: Yeah .
WILL: What happened to that guy from Kentucky ?
SEAN: Lon ? He got married . He has a kid . I kind of lost touch with him afte Nancy got sick .
WILL: Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met you wife ?
SEAN: What ? Do I wonder if I 'd be bette off if I never met my wife ? Will starts to clarify his question .
WILL: You do n't regret meetin ' your wife ?
SEAN: Why ? Because of the pain I feel now ? I have regrets Will , but I do n't egret a singel day I spent with her .
WILL: When did you know she was the one ?
SEAN: October 21 , 1975 . Game six of the World Series . Biggest game in Red Sox history , Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets . We were sitting in a ba waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl . What a game that was . Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning , in steps Carlton Fisk , hit a long fly ball down the left field line . Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet , screamin ' at the all to stay fair . Fisk is runnin ' up the baseline , wavin ' at the ball like a madman . It hits the foul pole , home run . Thirty-five thousand people went crazy . And I was n't one of them .
WILL: Where were you ?
SEAN: I was havin ' a drink with my future wife .
WILL: You missed Pudge Fisk 's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met ?
SEAN: That 's right .
WILL: So wait a minute . The Red Sox have n't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen , you slept out for tickets , games gon na start in twenty minutes , in walks a girl you never seen before , and you give your ticket away ?
SEAN: You should have seen this girl . She lit up the room .
WILL: I do n't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar ! That 's game six of the World Series ! Sean smiles .
SEAN: I just slid my ticket across the table and said `` sorry fellas , I got ta go see about a girl . ''
WILL: `` I got ta go see about a girl '' ? What did they say ?
SEAN: They could see that I meant it .
WILL: You 're kiddin ' me .
SEAN: No Will , I 'm not kiddin ' you . If I had gone to see that game I 'd be in here talkin ' abouta girl I saw at a ar twenty years ago . And how I always egretted not goin ' over there and talkin ' to her . I do n't regret the eighteen years we were married . I do n't regret givin ' up counseling for six years when she got sick . I do n't regret being by her side fo the last two years when things got eal bad . And I sure as Hell do n't egret missing that damn game . A beat . Will is impressed .
WILL: Would have been nice to catch that game though .
SEAN: Well hell , I did n't know Pudge was gon na hit the home run . They laugh .
LAMBEAU: Alexander , I know your theory . The oy is updating , he 's strategy stealing
PEKEC: With a Ramses graph on the binary tree
LAMBEAU: But what he 's doing , he 's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex . He can always failsafe to either side
PEKEC: Maker can . This is not new , Gerry !
LAMBEAU: No , there 's a limit .
PEKEC: The limit is not found ! The limit is not found .
WILL: But I can always go to the othe side .
PEKEC: There is no proof Lambeau can no longer contain himself .
LAMBEAU: Maker builds `` K '' to the `` N. '' N is three to the K times
PEKEC: But
WILL: Look , I wrote it down .
LAMBEAU: Alexander , your theory is changed .
SKYLAR: Why do we always stay here ?
WILL: 'Cause it 's nicer than my place .
SKYLAR: I 've never seen your place .
WILL: Exactly .
SKYLAR: What about your friends ? Or you others ? When do I get to meet them ?
WILL: They do n't come over here that much .
SKYLAR: I think I can make it to South Boston .
WILL: Aah , it 's kind of a hike .
SKYLAR: Is it me you 're hiding from them o the other way around ?
WILL: All right , all right . We 'll go .
SKYLAR: When ?
WILL: Sometime . I do n't know . Next week .
SKYLAR: What if I said I would n't sleep with you again until you let me meet you friends ?
WILL: I 'd say It 's only four in the mornin ' , they 're prob'ly up . She laughs . Stops him .
SKYLAR: You men are shameful . If you 're not thinking of your wiener then you 're acting on its behalf .
WILL: Then on behalf of my wiener , I 'd like to ask for an advance .
MORGAN: Will , I ca n't believe you brought Skylar here when we 're all wrecked . What 's she gon na think about us ?
WILL: Yeah , Morgan . It 's a real rarity that we 'd be out drinkin ' .
BILLY: I 've been shit faced for like two weeks .
MORGAN: Oh great , tell her that ! Now she eally thinks we 're problem drinkers !
CHUCKIE: Two weeks ? That 's nothin ' . My Uncle Marty ? Will knows him . That guy fuckin ' drinks like you 've neve seen ! One night he was drivin ' back to his house on I-93 Statie pulls him over .
ALL: Oh shit .
CHUCKIE: Guy 's tryin ' to walk the line but he ca n't even fuckin ' stand up , and so my uncle 's gon na spend a night in jail . Just then there 's this fuckin ' BOOM like fifty yards down the road . Some guy 's car hit a tree .
MORGAN: Some other guy ?
CHUCKIE: Yeah , he was probably drunker than my Uncle , who fuckin ' knows ? So the cop goes `` Stay here '' And he goes unnin ' down the highway to deal with the other crash . So , my Uncle Marty 's standin ' on the side of the oad for a little while , and he 's so fuckin ' lit , that he forgets what he 's waitin ' for . So he goes , `` Fuck it . '' He gets in his car and drives home .
MORGAN: Holy shit .
CHUCKIE: So in the morning , there 's a knock on the door it 's the Statie . So my Uncle 's like , `` Is there a problem ? '' And the Statie 's like `` I pulled you over and you took off . '' And my Uncle 's like `` I never seen you before in my life , I been home all night with my kids . '' And Statie 's like `` Let me get in your garage ! '' So he 's like `` All right , fine . '' He takes around the garage and opens the door and the Statie 's cruiser is in my Uncle 's garage .
ALL: No way ! You 're kiddin ' !
CHUCKIE: No , he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home . Fuckin ' lights and everything !
MORGAN: Did your Uncle get arrested ?
CHUCKIE: The fuckin ' Trooper was so embarrassed he did n't do anything . The fuckin ' guy had been drivin ' around in my Uncle 's car all night lookin ' fo the house .
SKYLAR: There was this Irish guy , walking down the beach one day .
CHUCKIE: It 's a good thing no one 's Irish here .
MORGAN: I 'm Irish . Chuckie , Will look at Morgan , baffled .
CHUCKIE: I 'm glad you came by , changed my opinion of Harvard people .
SKYLAR: See ya ' Chuckie . I had fun . Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight .
WILL: I do n't know what the fuck you 're doin ' . You 're givin ' us a ride .
CHUCKIE: What do I look like , Al Cowlins ? You want to take my car , drop he off ?
WILL: I was countin ' on it .
MORGAN: Chuck , let 's go .
CHUCKIE: You 're walkin ' bitch , Will 's takin ' the car .
WILL: Thanks , Chuck .
CHUCKIE: Do n't get too slap-happy , you 're takin ' me home first .
WILL: I do n't know , Chuck . It 's kinda outta the way .
CHUCKIE: Just 'cause you do n't have to sleep in the one room palace , do n't start thinkin ' you 're bad .
SKYLAR: I thought you said you 'd show me your place .
WILL: Not tonight .
CHUCKIE: Yeah , not tonight . Not any othe night .
SKYLAR: I wanted to meet your brothers Chuckie gives Will a curious look .
WILL: They 're all sleepin ' now . Let me get those keys .
RECRUITER #1: What I want to know , Gerry , is when we get to meet this wonder-boy .
LAMBEAU: We 're still working together , the oy 's a little rough .
RECRUITER #2: We 've got our share of eccentric geniuses at Tri-tech . We know how to deal with that .
RECRUITER #3: I think we all do . Laughter .
RECRUITER #1: If you 're not exaggerating , Gerry
LAMBEAU: Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty- four when I told you I 'd win the Field 's medal within two years ? More laughter .
RECRUITER #1: In that case the boy could run shipping for us , routing
RECRUITER #2: You say he does n't have a diploma , ut we'll—
RECRUITER #1: I do n't need to see a driver 's license . I can think of three departments right now that he could head up for us .
LAMBEAU: At ease , gentlemen . We 're looking carefully at all our options .
RECRUITER #3: All right , Gerry . Close to the vest . Good luck with these vultures . He walks off .
SEAN: So she goes runnin ' up the aisle and I figure `` fuck it '' and I yell out `` do n't forget the coffee !
MARTY: Bullshit ! You did n't say that ! Timmy and Sean exchange a look .
TIMMY: Jesus Christ , Marty . It 's a joke .
SEAN: Gerry ! Any trouble finding the place ?
LAMBEAU: Not at all .
SEAN: Timmy this is Gerry , an old friend of mine . We went to college together .
TIMMY: Good to meet you .
LAMBEAU: Pleasure to meet you .
SEAN: Could we get a couple of sandwiches ? Put it on my tab . Sean heads towards a table .
TIMMY: You ever plan on payin ' your tab ?
SEAN: I got the winning numbers right here .
TIMMY: What 's the jackpot ?
SEAN: Twelve million .
TIMMY: I do n't think that 'll cover it . Lambeau follows . They sit .
LAMBEAU: You 're here quite a bit , then .
SEAN: I live right around the corner .
LAMBEAU: You moved ?
SEAN: I been here a couple years . There is an awkward moment .
LAMBEAU: Seems like it 's going well .
SEAN: I think so .
LAMBEAU: Well , have you talked to him at all about his future ?
SEAN: We have n't really gotten into it .
LAMBEAU: Maybe you should . My phone 's been inging off the hook with job offers .
SEAN: Jobs doing what ?
LAMBEAU: Cutting edge mathematics . Think tanks . The kind of place where a mind like Will 's is given free reign .
SEAN: That 's great , Gerry , that there 's interest But I 'm not sure he 's eady for that .
LAMBEAU: Sean , I really do n't think you understand
SEAN: What do n't I understand ? Timmy comes over with the sandwiches .
LAMBEAU: Excuse me , Timmy . Could you help us ? We 're trying to settle a bet .
TIMMY: Uh-oh .
LAMBEAU: Have you heard of Jonas Salk ?
TIMMY: Yeah , cured polio .
LAMBEAU: You 've heard of Albert Einstein ? Timmy smiles . Gives him a look .
TIMMY: No .
LAMBEAU: Okay thank you , Timmy .
TIMMY: So who won the bet ?
LAMBEAU: I did . A beat . Timmy leaves .
SEAN: Is n't that a little dramatic , Gerry ?
LAMBEAU: No , Sean . This boy has that gift . He just has n't got the direction . We can give that to him . A beat .
SEAN: He married his cousin .
LAMBEAU: Who ?
SEAN: Einstein . Had two marriages , both trainwrecks . The guy never saw his kids , one of whom , I think , ended up in an asylum- possible Unabombe addition
LAMBEAU: You see , Sean ? That 's exactly not the point . No one remembers that . They
SEAN: I do .
LAMBEAU: Well , you 're the only one . Beat .
SEAN: Just take it easy , Gerry .
LAMBEAU: Look , I do n't know what else I can say . I 'm not sitting at home every night , twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy 's life . But it 's important to start early . I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field 's medal .
SEAN: Maybe he does n't care about that . A beat .
LAMBEAU: Sean , this is important . And it 's above personal rivalry
SEAN: Now wait a minute , Gerry
LAMBEAU: No , no you hear me out , Sean . This young man is a true prodigy
SEAN: Personal rivalry ? I 'm not getting ack at you .
LAMBEAU: Look , you took one road and I took another . That 's fine .
SEAN: Is it Gerry ? 'Cause I do n't think it 's fine with you . Give him time to figure out what he wants .
LAMBEAU: That 's a wonderful theory , Sean . It worked wonders for you . A beat . Lambeau gets up .
EXECUTIVE: Well , Will , I 'm not exactly sure what you mean , we 've already offered you a position..
CHUCKIE: Since this is obviously not my first time in such altercations , let me say this
EXECUTIVE: I 'm not sure
CHUCKIE: These circumstances are mitigated . Right now . They 're mitigated .
EXECUTIVE: Okay Chuckie points to the third executive .
CHUCKIE: He knows what I 'm talking about . The third executive is baffled .
EXECUTIVE: Will , our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year , plus benefits .
CHUCKIE: Retainer
EXECUTIVE: You want us to give you cash right now ?
CHUCKIE: Allegedly , what I am saying is you situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now .
EXECUTIVE: I do n't think I Larry ?
CHUCKIE: Come now what do you think I am , a juvenile ? You do n't got any money on you right now . You think I 'm gon na take a check ?
EXECUTIVE: It 's fine , John , I can cover the est .
CHUCKIE: That 's right , you know . He knows . Chuckie stands up and takes the money .
WILL: How 's it goin ' ?
SKYLAR: Fine .
WILL: Want me to take a look ?
SKYLAR: No .
WILL: C'mon , give me a peek and we 'll go to the battin ' cages .
SKYLAR: It 's important that I learn this .
WILL: Why is it important to you ? If I inherited all that money , the only thing important to me would be workin ' on my swing .
SKYLAR: Clearly .
WILL: You 're rich . What do you have to worry about ?
SKYLAR: Rich ? I have an inheritance . It 's two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . That 's exactly what it 'll cost me , minus about five hundred ucks , to go all the way through med school . This is what I 'm doing with that money . I could have done anything I wanted . I could have expanded my wardrobe , substantially .
WILL: Instead you 're going to bust you ass for five years so you can be oke ?
SKYLAR: No , so I can be a doctor . A beat . Will nods . She looks down , then up .
WILL: I guess . I do n't know . How do you emember your phone number ?
SKYLAR: Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry ?
WILL: Some , a little .
SKYLAR: Just for fun ?
WILL: I guess so .
SKYLAR: Nobody does organic chemistry fo `` fun . '' It 's unnecessary . Especially for someone like you .
WILL: Like me ?
SKYLAR: Yeah . Someone like you who divides his time , fairly evenly , between the atting cages and bars . Will laughs .
WILL: Do you play the piano ?
SKYLAR: Come one Will . I just want to know .
WILL: I 'm trying to explain it to you . So you play the piano . When you look at the keys , you see music , you see Mozart .
SKYLAR: I see `` Hot Cross Buns , '' but okay .
WILL: Well all right , Beethoven . He looked at a piano and saw music . The fuckin ' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy . They had to turn him around to take a bow because he could n't hear the crowd going crazy ehind him . Stone deaf . He saw all of that music in his head .
SKYLAR: So , do you play the piano ?
WILL: Not a lick . I look at a piano and I see black and white keys , three pedals and a box of wood . Beethoven , Mozart , they looked at it and it just made sense to them . They saw a piano and they could play . I could n't paint you a picture , I probably ca n't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I ca n't play the piano
SKYLAR: But you can do my O-chem lab in unde an hour , you can
WILL: When it came to stuff like that I could always just play .
SKYLAR: I ca n't believe it 's taken me fou years to meet you and I 'm going to California in two months , Will . Have you ever been to California ? I et you 'd like it . Will freezes . A beat .
CHUCKIE: Get it , ma !
SKYLAR: Hi .
CHUCKIE: How you doin ' ?
SKYLAR: Good . An awkward beat .
CHUCKIE: How 'd you know where to find me ?
SKYLAR: You were the only Sullivan in the phone book . Chuckie smiles .
CHUCKIE: Oh , right .
SKYLAR: This is your house , right ?
CHUCKIE: Pipe down , Ma !
SKYLAR: I guess so .
CHUCKIE: What ? No . This is my mother 's house . I do n't live with my mother . I just stop by , help out . I 'm good like that .
SKYLAR: Is this a bad time ?
CHUCKIE: She 'll live . If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but
SKYLAR: Okay .
CHUCKIE: Let 's take a walk .
SKYLAR: See , now this does n't feel right . When I made the decision to come over here it felt right . I had all these rationalizations I just do n't understand why Will never tells me anything , he wo n't let me get close to him , he tells me these weird lies
CHUCKIE: You caught that , huh ?
SKYLAR: I just wanted to find out what was going on But now that I 'm here it seems strange , does n't it ?
CHUCKIE: Well , I do n't have no trousers on She laughs . A beat .
SKYLAR: I do n't care what his family 's like or if he does n't have any brothers , ut he does n't have to lie to me .
CHUCKIE: I really do n't know what to say . Look , I lie to women all the time . That 's just my way . Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale . I told them I was a cosmonaut . They believed me . But Will 's not usually like that
SKYLAR: Is that true ?
CHUCKIE: Yeah , it is .
TOM: ! ! ! !
WILL: ! ! ! !
LAMBEAU: This is correct . I see you used Mclullen here
WILL: I do n't know what it 's called .
LAMBEAU: This ca n't be right . This is going to be very embarrassing . Have you ever considered
WILL: I 'm pretty sure it 's right . Will gets up to leave .
LAMBEAU: That 's fine , but did you ever think
WILL: It 's right . Take it home with you .
LAMBEAU: Will , what happened at the Tri-tech meeting ?
WILL: I could n't go 'cause I had a date . So I sent my chief negotiator .
LAMBEAU: Will , on your own time , you can do what you like . When I set up a meeting , with my associates , and you do n't show up it reflects poorly on me .
WILL: Then do n't set up any more meetings .
LAMBEAU: I 'll cancel every meeting right now . I 'll give you a job myself . I just wanted you to see what was out there .
WILL: Maybe I do n't want to spend my life sittin ' around and explaining shit to people .
LAMBEAU: The least you can do is show me a little appreciation .
WILL: You know how fuckin ' easy this is to me ? This is a joke ! And I 'm sorry you ca n't do this . I eally am . 'Cause if you could I would n't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up .
LAMBEAU: Sure , then you 'd have more time to sit around and get drunk . Think of how many fights you could have been in by now .
WILL: Well , I 'm sorry .
LAMBEAU: So am I . Yes . That 's right , Will . Most days I wish I never met you . Because then I could sleep at night . I would n't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there . And I would n't have to watch you throw it all away .
SKYLAR: Will ? Are you awake ?
WILL: No .
SKYLAR: Come with me to California .
WILL: What ?
SKYLAR: I want you to come with me .
WILL: How do you know that ?
SKYLAR: I know . I just do .
WILL: Yeah , but how do you know ?
SKYLAR: I do n't know . I just feel it .
WILL: And you 're sure about that ?
SKYLAR: Yeah , I 'm sure .
WILL: 'Cause that 's a serious thing you 're sayin ' . I mean , we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin ' about me that you do n't like . And you might feel like `` hey this is a big mistake . '' But you ca n't take it back , 'cause you know it 's real serious and you ca n't take somethin ' like that back . Now I 'm in California , 'cause you asked me to come . But you do n't really want me there . And I 'm stuck in California with someone who really does n't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back .
SKYLAR: `` Take-back ? '' What is that ? I do n't want a take-back . I want you to come to California with me .
WILL: I ca n't go out to California .
SKYLAR: Why not ?
WILL: One , because I have a job here and two because I live here
SKYLAR: Look , Will if you 're not in love with me , you can say that .
WILL: I 'm not sayin ' I 'm not in love with you .
SKYLAR: Then what are you afraid of ?
WILL: What do you mean `` What am I afraid of ? ''
SKYLAR: Why wo n't you come with me ? What are you so scared of ?
WILL: What am I scared of ?
SKYLAR: Well , what are n't you scared of ? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you 're scared shitless to do anything else
WILL: Do n't tell me about my world . You 're the one that 's afraid . You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry
SKYLAR: Is that what you think
WILL: some prick from Stanford that you parents will approve of . Then you 'll sit around with the rest of the uppe crust kids and talk about how you went slummin ' too .
SKYLAR: I inherited that money when I was thirteen , when my father died .
WILL: At least you have a mother .
SKYLAR: Fuck you ! You think I want this ? That money 's a burden to me . Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back . I 'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father . But that 's life . And I deal with it . So do n't put that shit on me . You 're the one that 's afraid .
WILL: What the fuck am I afraid of ? !
SKYLAR: You 're afraid of me . You 're afraid that I wo n't love you back . And guess what ? I 'm afraid too . But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot . At least I 'm honest with you .
WILL: I 'm not honest ?
SKYLAR: What about your twelve brothers ?
WILL: Oh , is that what this is about ? You want to hear that I do n't really have any brothers ? That I 'm a fuckin ' orphan ? Is that what you want to hear ?
SKYLAR: Yes , Will . I did n't even know that ?
WILL: No , you do n't want to hear that .
SKYLAR: Yes , I do , Will .
WILL: You do n't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid . That this is n't surgery .
SKYLAR: Yes I do . Did you ever think that maybe I could help you ? That maybe that 's the point , that we 're a team ?
WILL: What , you want to come in here and save me ? Is that what you want to do ? Do I have a sign that says `` save me '' on my back ?
SKYLAR: I do n't want to `` save '' you . I just want to be with you . I love you . I love you !
WILL: Do n't bullshit me ! Do n't fuckin ' ullshit me !
SKYLAR: You know what I want to hear ? I want to hear that you do n't love me . If you tell me that , then I 'll leave you alone . I wo n't ask any questions and I wo n't be in your life .
WILL: I do n't love you . He walks out .
DYTRESS: Well , you 'd be working on the cutting edge . You 'd be exposed to the kind of technology you could n't see anywhere else because we 've classified it . Super string theory , Chaos Math , Advanced algorithms
WILL: Codebreaking .
DYTRESS: That 's one aspect of what we do .
WILL: Come on , that 's what you do . You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload . You 're seven times the size of the C.I.A .
DYTRESS: That 's exactly right , Will . So the question as I see it is n't `` why should you work for N.S.A . '' it 's `` why should n't you ? ''
WILL: Why should n't I work for the National Security Agency ? That 's a tough one .
CHUCKIE: Morgan , if you 're watchin ' pornos in my mom 's room again I 'm gon na give you a fuckin ' beatin ' !
MORGAN: What 's up guys ?
CHUCKIE: Why do n't you beat off at your house ?
MORGAN: I do n't have a VCR at my house . Will pays no attention to this exchange
WILL: I just wanted to call before you left . I 'm takin ' all these job interviews . So I wo n't just be a construction worker .
SKYLAR: I never cared about that . An awkward beat .
WILL: Yeah .
SKYLAR: I love you , Will . No take-backs . Will says nothing .
WILL: Take care .
SKYLAR: Goodbye .
LAMBEAU: I can I 'm almost there .
WILL: It 's a Carlton Fisk baseball card . Will can see that Lambeau wants more .
LAMBEAU: No .
WILL: Oh , well , it 's just somethin ' Sean told me . It 's a long story . A beat .
LAMBEAU: I 've got the first part . The rest I can do at home . Will gets up .
WILL: Yeah .
SEAN: So you might be working for Uncle Sam .
WILL: I do n't know .
SEAN: Gerry says the meeting went well .
WILL: I guess .
SEAN: What did you think ?
WILL: What did I think ?
SEAN: Do you think you 're alone ?
WILL: What ?
SEAN: Do you have a soul-mate ?
WILL: Define that .
SEAN: Someone who challenges you in every way . Who takes you places , opens things up for you . A soul-mate .
WILL: Yeah . Sean waits .
SEAN: They 're all dead .
WILL: Not to me , they 're not .
SEAN: But you ca n't give back to them , Will .
WILL: Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts , no
SEAN: That 's what I 'm saying , Will . You 'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you 're afraid to take the first step because all you 're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road .
WILL: Oh , what ? You 're going to take the professor 's side on this ?
SEAN: Do n't give me your line of shit .
WILL: I did n't want the job .
SEAN: It 's not about that job . I 'm not saying you should work for the government . But , you could do anything you want . And there are people who work their whole lives layin ' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have . What do you want to do ?
WILL: I did n't ask for this .
SEAN: Nobody gets what they ask for , Will . That 's a cop-out .
WILL: Why is it a cop-out ? I do n't see anythin ' wrong with layin ' brick , that 's somebody 's home I 'm buildin ' . Or fixin ' somebody 's car , somebody 's gon na get to work the next day 'cause of me . There 's honor in that .
SEAN: You 're right , Will . Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man . A beat . Will says nothing .
WILL: What ?
SEAN: If you wo n't answer my questions , you 're wasting my time .
WILL: What ? Will loses it , slams the door shut .
SEAN: I been there . I played my hand .
WILL: That 's right . And you fuckin ' lost ! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again !
SEAN: Look at me . What do you want to do ? A beat . Will looks up .
LAMBEAU: What I mean , Sean , is that I 'm sitting in your office and the boy is n't here . Well , it 's ten past three . An hour and ten minutes late . Well , if he does n't show up and I have to file a report saying he was n't here and he goes back to jail , it wo n't be on my conscience , Sean . Fine .
TOM: What should I do ?
LAMBEAU: The boy was here . He came in , sat down and we worked together . A blank look .
TOM: Okay . Tom understands , begins filling out the form .
CHUCKIE: How 's the woman ?
WILL: Gone .
CHUCKIE: What ?
WILL: She went to Medical school in California .
CHUCKIE: Sorry , brother . I do n't know what to tell ya . You know all the girls I been with . You een with 'em too , except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother
WILL: Oh I 'm sure , that 's why only one of us has herpes .
CHUCKIE: Some shows are worth the price of admission , partner . This gets a small laugh from Will .
WILL: Fuck you .
CHUCKIE: Suck my crank . Fuckin ' sheet metal pussy . So , when are you done with those meetin 's ?
WILL: Week after I 'm twenty-one .
CHUCKIE: Are they hookin ' you up with a job ?
WILL: Yeah , sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years .
CHUCKIE: Yah , but it 's better than this shit . At least you 'd make some nice bank .
WILL: Yeah , be a fuckin ' lab rat .
CHUCKIE: It 's a way outta here .
WILL: What do I want a way outta here for ? I want to live here the rest of my life . I want to be your next doo neighbor . I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field .
CHUCKIE: Look , you 're my best friend , so do n't take this the wrong way , but in 20 years , if you 're livin ' next door to me , comin ' over watchin ' the fuckin ' Patriots ' games and still workin ' construction , I 'll fuckin ' kill you . And that 's not a threat , that 's a fact . I 'll fuckin ' kill you .
WILL: Chuckie , what are you talkin '
CHUCKIE: Listen , you got somethin ' that none of us have .
WILL: Why is it always this ? I owe it to myself ? What if I do n't want to ?
CHUCKIE: Fuck you . You owe it to me . Tomorrow I 'm gon na wake up and I 'll be fifty and I 'll still be doin ' this . And that 's all right 'cause I 'm gon na make a run at it . But you , you 're sittin ' on a winning lottery ticket and you 're too much of a pussy to cash it in . And that 's bullshit 'cause I 'd do anything to have what you got ! And so would any of these guys . It 'd be a fuckin ' insult to us if you 're still here in twenty years .
WILL: You do n't know that .
CHUCKIE: Let me tell you what I do know . Every day I come by to pick you up , and we go out drinkin ' or whatever and we have a few laughs . But you know what the best part of my day is ? The ten seconds before I knock on the doo 'cause I let myself think I might get there , and you 'd be gone . I 'd knock on the door and you would n't e there . You just left . A beat .
LAMBEAU: This is a disaster ! I brought you in here to help me with this boy , not to run him out
SEAN: Now wait a minute
LAMBEAU: And confuse him
SEAN: Gerry
LAMBEAU: And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake
SEAN: Hold on !
LAMBEAU: Ready to falsify documents because you 've given him license to walk away from this .
SEAN: I know what I 'm doing and I know why I 'm here !
LAMBEAU: Look Sean , I do n't care if you have a rapport with the boy I do n't care if you have a few laughs even at my expense ! But do n't you dare undermine what I 'm trying to do here .
SEAN: `` Undermine ? ''
LAMBEAU: He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility . And you do n't understand that he 's at a fragile point
SEAN: He is at a fragile point . He 's got problems
LAMBEAU: What problems does he have , Sean , that he is better off as a janito or in jail or hanging around with
SEAN: Why do you think he does that , Gerry ?
LAMBEAU: He can handle the work , he can handle the pressure and he 's obviously handled you .
SEAN: Why is he hiding ? Why is he a janitor ? Why does n't he trust anybody ? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most !
LAMBEAU: Oh , come on , Sean
SEAN: And why does he hang out with his friends ? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a at to your head if he asked them to . It 's called loyalty !
LAMBEAU: Oh , that 's nice
SEAN: And who do you think he 's handling ? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him . And fo 20 years he 's been alone because of that . And if you try to push him into this , it 's going to be the same thing all over again . And I 'm not going to let that happen to him !
LAMBEAU: Now do n't do that . Do n't you do that ! Do n't infect him with the idea that it 's okay to quit . That it 's okay to e a failure , because it 's not okay ! If you 're angry at me for being successful , for being what you could have been
SEAN: I 'm not angry at you
LAMBEAU: Yes you are , Sean . You resent me . And I 'm not going to apologize fo any success that I 've had .
SEAN: I do n't have any anger at you
LAMBEAU: Yes you do . You 're angry at me fo doing what you could have done . Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life , to feel like a failure .
SEAN: That 's it . That 's why I do n't come to the goddamn reunions ! Because I ca n't stand the look in your eye when you see me ! You think I 'm a failure ! I know who I am . I 'm proud of who I am . And all of you , you think I 'm some kind of pity case ! You with your sycophant students following you around . And your Goddamn Medal !
LAMBEAU: Is that what this is about , Sean ? The Field 's Medal ? Do you want me to go home and get it for you ? Then will you let the boy
SEAN: I do n't want your trophy and I do n't give a shit about it ! 'Cause I knew you when ! ! You and Jack and Tom Sanders . I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and did n't know what side of the bed to piss on !
LAMBEAU: That 's right ! You were smarter than us then and you 're smarter than us now ! So do n't blame me for how you life turned out . It 's not my fault .
SEAN: I do n't blame you ! It 's not about that ! It 's about the boy ! 'Cause he 's a good kid ! And I wo n't see this happen to him- wo n't see you make him feel like a failure too !
LAMBEAU: He wo n't be a failure !
SEAN: If you push him into something , if you ride him
LAMBEAU: You 're wrong , Sean . I 'm where I am today because I was pushed . And ecause I learned to push myself !
SEAN: He 's not you !
WILL: I can come back .
LAMBEAU: No , that 's fine , Will . I was just leaving .
WILL: Well , I 'm here . So , is that my problem ? I 'm afraid of being abandoned ? That was easy .
SEAN: Look , a lot of that stuff goes back a long way . And it 's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you .
WILL: Do you want to talk about it ?
SEAN: Oh , this is your file . I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation .
WILL: You 're not going to fail me are you ? Sean smiles .
SEAN: You want to read it ?
WILL: No . Have you had any experience with that ?
SEAN: Twenty years of counseling you see a lot of
WILL: No , have you had any experience with that ?
SEAN: Yes .
WILL: It sure ai n't good .
SEAN: My dad used to make us walk down to the park and collect the sticks he was going to beat us with . Actually the worst of the beatings were between me and my brother . We would practice on each other trying to find sticks that would break .
WILL: He used to just put a belt , a stick and a wrench on the kitchen table and say `` choose . ''
SEAN: Got ta go with the belt there
WILL: I used to go with the wrench .
SEAN: The wrench , why ?
WILL: Cause fuck him , that 's why . A long quiet moment .
SEAN: I did n't know you had . Do you want to talk about that ? I do n't know a lot , Will . But let me tell you one thing . All this history , this shit Look here , son .
WILL: Oh , I know .
SEAN: It 's not your fault .
WILL: I know .
SEAN: It 's not your fault .
WILL: I know .
SEAN: It 's not your fault .
WILL: I know .
SEAN: It 's not your fault .
WILL: Do n't fuck with me .
SEAN: It 's not your fault .
WILL: I know .
SEAN: It 's not
WILL: I know , I know
SECURITY GUARD: Can I help you ?
WILL: Yeah , my name is Will Hunting . I 'm here about a position .
SECURITY GUARD: One moment . The guard reaches for the phone .
CHUCKIE: Oh my God , I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin ' to tell you .
MORGAN: Save it for your mother , funny guy . We heard it before .
CHUCKIE: Oh , Morgan .
WILL: Sorry to miss this .
CHUCKIE: No , I had to talk him down .
WILL: Why did n't you yoke him ?
CHUCKIE: Little Morgan 's got a lot a scrap , dude . I 'd rather fight a big kid , they never fight , everyone 's scared of 'em . You know how many people try to whip Morgan 's ass every week ? Fuckin ' kid wo n't back down .
MORGAN: What 'd you say about me ?
CHUCKIE: Shut the fuck up .
MORGAN: You thought we forgot , did n't you ? I know I 'm gettin ' my licks in .
CHUCKIE: Shut up , Morgan . Here 's your present .
WILL: You 're kiddin ' me .
CHUCKIE: Yeah , I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge , you needed some way to get over there and I knew I was n't gon na drive you every day Laughter .
MORGAN: No I did n't
CHUCKIE: But you 're twenty-one now , so
BILLY: Yeah , now that you can drink legally , we thought the best thing to get you was a car . More laughter . Will inspects the Nova .
WILL: You 're kiddin ' me . This is the ugliest fuckin ' car I ever seen in my life . Laughter , a beat .
CHUCKIE: Me and Bill scraped together the parts , worked on it . Morgan was out panhandlin ' every day .
MORGAN: Fuck you , I did the body work . Whose fuckin ' router you think sanded out all that bondo ?
CHUCKIE: Guy 's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin ' job . I had to let him help with the car .
WILL: So , you finally got a job Morgan ?

TADHG: Then what is it ?
PADDY: I did n't . On me life . Tadhg wipes away the slime with his sweater .
TADHG: Eurgh , the smell .
PADDY: So what is it ?
TADHG: I dunno , it 's a feckin octopus o something , it 's covered in seaweed . But 't is no feckin ' lobster ! Tadhg stomps off .

LISA: Well , I 'm not . I 'd some holidays saved that needed to be taken and this posting came up and I thought sure what harm , why not ? Ca n't hurt with the review board , you know ? O'Shea nods , sussing her out .
O'SHEA: Where are you stationed ?

LISA: Great . We got drugs , muggings , murders and rapes . Always on the go .

LISA: You never know . It 's the quiet places where all the mad shit happens . Just open a paper . O'Shea smirks out his window . Lisa notices .
O'SHEA: I bet you have n't missed a day of work in your life .
LISA: And should I be ashamed of that ?
O'SHEA: It 's just a job .

O'SHEA: You 're all right .
LISA: I 'd prefer it if you 'd introduce me as Garda Nolan .
O'SHEA: Ah , no one minds .
LISA: I do .
O'SHEA: What happened ?
SMITH: One second .
LISA: Lisa . O'Shea stares at her . Typical .
O'SHEA: Smith 's a marine psychologist o something , did I get that right ?
SMITH: No . It 's marine ecology . O'Shea shrugs , whatever .
LISA: That was quick .
SMITH: More fortunate really . I 'm based here doing studies for the department of the marine . Smith hands O'Shea the tip of a tape measure .
LISA: Two weeks .
SMITH: Oh , wonderful . Wonderful . Are you staying nearby ? O'Shea interrupts , deliberately
O'SHEA: So are they dead ? !
SMITH: Hmm ? No , they 're just sleeping .
O'SHEA: Slipped . O'Shea and Smith trade looks .
LISA: So what happened ?
SMITH: Well they 're pilot whales . It happens with them from time to time ut no one really knows why .
LISA: What are those marks ?
SMITH: Not sure . Possible scratches off the rocks while washing up here .
LISA: They did n't beach themselves ?
SMITH: No , they died at sea .
O'SHEA: All of them ? At once ?
SMITH: It 's a strange one all right . O'Shea considers the ocean before him .
O'SHEA: Hey , Daly , Cooney about ?
DALY: Now that is one arresting woman .
LISA: You , what 's your name ?
POLISH ACCENT: Przemyslaw Wojciechowski .

COONEY: Where 's Kenifick ?
O'SHEA: On holiday . Leaving me up the creek .

LISA: Oh , right . Well , I have a key so see you Monday then .

PADDY: Would n't you like to know ?
O'SHEA: No , not really . O'Shea turns back to his drink .
PADDY: But you would , though .
O'SHEA: Nope .
PADDY: You would ! If you were to know what I know you 'd want to know .
O'SHEA: All right , tell us then . Paddy shuffles closer , all excited .
PADDY: Right , between you and me , I caught meself a sea monster today .
OFF O'SHEA: Ya do n't believe me ?
O'SHEA: Not a bit .
PADDY: I 'm no liar ! Brian snickers in the corner .
BRIAN: Ha !
PADDY: Feck off , you .
O'SHEA: All right , where is it ?
PADDY: In me bathtub .
O'SHEA: In your bathtub ?
PADDY: Having a bath .
O'SHEA: G'night , Paddy . O'Shea downs his drink and saunters off .
PADDY: Ignorant gobshite .
O'SHEA: What ?
PADDY: Hmm ?
O'SHEA: What did you say ?
PADDY: Nothin ' . Did n't open me mouth .
BRIAN: He called you a gobshite .
TO BRIAN: You see you , if this was n't the only feckin ' pub on this shittin ' island I 'd piss on it than soone come in here .
BRIAN: Fine . You 're barred . Paddy thinks a moment , then cracks a smile .
PADDY: Ah I 'm joking , you know that . One more , huh ?
LISA: Is everything all right ?
O'SHEA: What is it ?
REALISES: What do you want ?
O'SHEA: Come on down for a drink .
LISA: I have work tomorrow .
O'SHEA: It does n't matter out here . No one will know .

O'SHEA: I am not . I 'm sober as a judge .
LISA: Is that so ? Say the alphabet ackwards for me .
O'SHEA: Zed Et cetera .
LISA: I hope you 're not driving ?
O'SHEA: Course not . I 'm taking Johnny 's horse .
LISA: You 're going to ride a horse while intoxicated ?
O'SHEA: Yeah , so ? The horse is sober .
LISA: Amazing , and you 're in charge here .
O'SHEA: Listen , I think we got off on the wrong foot today .
LISA: It 's OK . He helps her pick them up
O'SHEA: What 's that ?
LISA: Just your head ?
O'SHEA: Well , other places too . O'Shea grins suggestively , reading her wrong .
LISA: Do you get this drunk every night ?
O'SHEA: Just high days and holidays .
LISA: Let 's get you to bed .
O'SHEA: Now you 're talking .
PADDY: You dirty
IRENE: Tadhg , you 're stinking . Would you get in the bath already , I can smell you from here .
TADHG: I 'm watching this .
TO HERSELF: What were you doing at all today ? Irene enters the kitchen
TO HERSELF: God , 't is blowing a gale out .
IRENE: I said 't is nothing . I do n't know why we had to move here . There was nothing wrong with me Mam 's house .
TO HIMSELF: Apart from your Mam . Irene appears behind him .
IRENE: What was that ?
TADHG: Irene ?
IRENE: What ?
TADHG: Someone 's at the door .
IRENE: I 'm not dressed .
TADHG: All right , all right .
IRENE: Do n't give that cowboy any money . He 'll only piss it up the wall . Tadhg opens the door .
TADHG: Cooney , you look like death . What are you doing ?
IRENE: What does he want ?
TO HIMSELF: To dance ?
IRENE: Jesus .
TADHG: Cooney ? Are you all right , mate ?
IRENE: Tadhg ! Tadhg !
UNA: Good morning . Sleep well ?
LISA: Grand , thanks . Do I have something to sign ?
UNA: Oh yeah . The big one .
LISA: How 's the weather looking ?
UNA: Oh , there 's a storm coming .
LISA: Really ? Are the gulls flying low or something ?
UNA: No , it 's on the telly .
LISA: Temporarily .
UNA: He 's a nice fella is n't he ? Quite a catch .
LISA: Depends what you 're fishing .
UNA: Single ? So 's O'Shea . Well , widowed . Lisa looks up .
LISA: Widowed ?
UNA: Why do you think he 's here ? Sure there 's no want for him round this neck of the woods but I suppose he wanted the peace . Or his superiors thought he did . He does n't say , God love him .
LISA: The single room is fine .
UNA: Are you sure now ? You never know if you want to stretch your legs later on . Give it a week and we 'll e booked solid , so we will .
LISA: I 'll think about it . Lisa hightails it .
O'SHEA: Wha.. ?
LISA: How much does a place like this go for ? I mean it 's close to the each , all mod-cons . It 's perfect .
O'SHEA: I uh , what happened ?
LISA: Section four point one of the Public Order Act . It is an offence for any person to be present in any public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might endange themselves or any other in the vicinity .
O'SHEA: You arrested me ? !
LISA: For your own good .
O'SHEA: Let me out of here .
LISA: Relax . You passed out before I could find your house . The phone RINGS ! Lisa picks it up .
PADDY: So I get a reward for discovering it , right ? A finders fee ?
O'SHEA: We 'll discuss it later .
PADDY: But I get something , right ? They enter .
O'SHEA: Eurgh .
SMITH: Is that your professional opinion ?
PADDY: A Grabber .
O'SHEA: A what ?
SMITH: I told you I 'm not calling it that . It needs a binomial nomenclature , one identifying its genus and class and once I 've figured that out
PADDY: I discovered it . I get to name it . Smith smiles at Lisa .
SMITH: Hi . Lisa smiles at Smith .
LISA: Hi . O'Shea smiles at Lisa . Mocking .
O'SHEA: Hi . Lisa 's smile drops . Paddy looks confused .
TO LISA: Hello .
LISA: What is that thing ?
SMITH: I have n't a clue . I 've never seen anything like it . It 's a completely foreign species . I ca n't even begin to originate or class it .
PADDY: A Grabber . Smith sighs .
LISA: And this attacked you ?
PADDY: Stuck on the ceiling , it was . Like a pancake . Nearly ripped me throat out .
O'SHEA: Is it dead ?
SMITH: I 'm not sure .
O'SHEA: You 're not what ?
SMITH: Well basic tests I 've done so fa have shown up nothing usual o normal . It 's beyond mystifying . Really I ca n't be certain without opening it up .
PADDY: 'T is dead .
SMITH: Would you stop doing that ? It is n't any wonder it bit you . Lisa stares at its multi-fanged jaws .
LISA: What 's that in its mouth ?
SMITH: Its tongue . Check it out .
LISA: That 's not a tongue .
O'SHEA: It 's a weapon .
PADDY: It spits like a frog and strangles ya . Whippet fast , and sharp .
SMITH: I 'm guessing it bleeds its prey like a leech . Consuming the blood , like some sort of vampiro toothis .
O'SHEA: Vampiro what ?
SMITH: Toothis . It 's a rare deep sea squid but this is n't that , not in Irish waters . No , this is something totally different . Something alien . In that it 's undocumented .
PADDY: It 's got ta be worth a fortune .
SMITH: But here 's the thing
PADDY: I stood on it a few times .
SMITH: this happened
PADDY: Could you put it on the eBay , do ya think ?
SMITH: You are not putting this on eBay . You 're lucky she did n't kill you .
O'SHEA: She ?
SMITH: Yeah , it 's a female from what I can tell .
PADDY: How can you tell ?
SMITH: It 's got no testicles . A long silence , Paddy nods . I see .
LISA: That 's disgusting .
SMITH: We 're dealing with something extraordinary here . And if it looks like this when it hatches , then this species nests on land . O'Shea and Lisa share a look . Uh oh .
LISA: Do you reckon those things had anything to do with those dead whales ?
O'SHEA: That 's Declan Cooney 's car .
LISA: Where could he be ?
O'SHEA: Nowhere without his keys . Do you elieve in coincidences ?
LISA: Not really .
O'SHEA: Neither do I .
LISA: Where are we going ?
O'SHEA: When you 're looking for answers you got ta go asking questions . He walks off . Lisa 's impressed .
O'SHEA: All the lights are on .
LISA: It 's Sunday . Hey , neither are you ! O'Shea smiles to himself .
O'SHEA: It suits you .
LISA: Smith 's a nice fella , is n't he ?
O'SHEA: Oh he 's positively smashing .
LISA: A proper gentleman . And such polite company .
O'SHEA: Uh huh . Tadhg ? Irene ?
LISA: A lovely fella .
O'SHEA: He 's like you , he 's married to his job .
LISA: I 'm not I take pride in my work . Unlike yourself .
O'SHEA: Shush , I 'm working .
LISA: You 're looking in the wrong place , Columbo .
LISA: Hold it steady .
O'SHEA: You 're something else , you know that . You should 've joined the army , not the guards .
LISA: Stop talking to yourself . It 's very distracting .
O'SHEA: I 'm not talking to myself , I 'm talking to you .
NOT LISTENING: Uh huh , great . There 's something up here .
O'SHEA: Could you be a bit more specific ?
LISA: It 's a
O'SHEA: Well ?
LISA: Ugh , it stinks like that thing .
O'SHEA: Aw Jesus Cock !
LISA: You broke its nose .
O'SHEA: What killed him , Jim ?
DR GLEESON: The fact he 's just a head ! Dr Gleeson turns back , writing .
DR GLEESON: They could bury him in a shoebox . That 's not right .
LISA: Doctor , we need to know .
DR GLEESON: I do n't know . A tiger ?
O'SHEA: A tiger ? !
LISA: I ca n't say that . Dr Gleeson loosens his tie .
DR GLEESON: I 'm telling you his head was torn off . By something big . O'Shea shares a look with Lisa .
PADDY: Holy Christ , wait till I tell ya !
O'SHEA: Jesus , Paddy .
PADDY: What ? What 's wrong with ya ?
O'SHEA: What is it ?
PADDY: Come look for yourself .
O'SHEA: OK , we 're here . Here 's where Cooney 's car was abandoned . Here 's Tadhg and Irene Murphy 's house and here 's where the whales washed up .
LISA: OK , so what does that mean ? O'Shea stares blankly .
O'SHEA: I have no idea . I was hoping it would show some sort of pattern .
PADDY: It 's the letter zed !
TO PADDY: Did you show that thing to anyone else before we saw it ?
PADDY: Tadhg Murphy got a look of it when I brought it in . It gawked on him , ut that was it . Lisa and O'Shea share a look .
LISA: We think there might be another one of those things , at least one anyway .
PADDY: Are you serious ?
O'SHEA: Yeah . That thing you caught could n't have fertilised that egg y itself , which would mean there 's a male out there big enough and strong enough to knock a hole in your bathroom wall .
OFF THAT: Smith said it needs water , right ?
O'SHEA: He says a lot of things .
PADDY: Mostly bollocks .
LISA: Whatever . But if it needs water to survive , how could it be moving about on dry land ?
PADDY: It was raining ! When it rains there 's no such thing as dry land . O'Shea and Lisa consider this .
LISA: There 's a storm due tonight .
PADDY: It 'll piss it down . O'Shea steels , and studies the map intensely .
O'SHEA: OK , all this is on the west side of the island , right ? So that would make this area its territory ; which would mean it 's got to be somewhere close . Somewhere with access to the waters around the west beach .
PADDY: The black rock caves . I caught the female just beyond there . O'Shea considers this . He looks to Lisa
O'SHEA: What do you think ?
LISA: I think we 've got at least two missing persons . We need to take a look .
PADDY: Ya know what 's to blame for all this ? Global warming . Ya got you icebergs meltin ' and you thingmajigs floodin ' . The whole world 's drownin ' and we do n't have the gills for it .
O'SHEA: What ?
LISA: I did n't say anything .
O'SHEA: You gave me that look .
LISA: What look ?
O'SHEA: The `` I feel sorry for you '' look .
LISA: No I did n't .
O'SHEA: Yeah you did .
LISA: No , I gave you the `` I feel embarrassed for you '' look . Big difference .
O'SHEA: Sure that 's worse !
LISA: What 's Smith got to do with you aging alcoholism ? Hmm ?
O'SHEA: I 'm not a raging You 're some character you know that . A real character . I 'm a social drinker .
LISA: Uh huh . Of course you are .
PADDY: We 're here .
O'SHEA: Wait here .
PADDY: You can be sure of it .
LISA: Are we missing some fishermen ?
CALLS OUT: Hello ! Lisa jolts , startled by O'Shea .
LISA: My heart ! What are you doing ?
O'SHEA: Just checking . Well , if you know of a better way ?
CALLS AGAIN: Hello ? !
LISA: What are you expecting ? `` Helloooo , 't is only me . ''
O'SHEA: Run !
LISA: I 'm trying !
O'SHEA: Move your arse !
LISA: Get your hands off my arse ! O'Shea shoves harder .
O'SHEA: If I die in here I want you to know it 's all your fault !
LISA: Oh shut up .
O'SHEA: It 's OK . It ca n't get us on dry land . Not when it 's not raining , it ca n't .
LISA: Leg it !
PADDY: Mother of God .
LISA: Run !
SMITH: Good , you 're back . I have a theory ! Those whales were killed as a food source for their spawn
O'SHEA: The eggs are buried at the beach .
SMITH: Exactly .
LISA: We know .
SMITH: Oh .
PADDY: Well done .
SMITH: What are you doing ?
O'SHEA: Everywhere that 's been , the othe one 's followed .
SMITH: You found another one ? Where ?
O'SHEA: It tried to eat us ! And it 's HUGE and looking for her but this will be the last place it looks .
SMITH: Are you mad ? Do n't do that ! Lisa takes a fire extinguisher off the wall .
LISA: Smith , it 's for the best .
SMITH: No , you muppet ! If he lights that in here you 'll
O'SHEA: Shit .
SMITH: You really are Irish . Lisa drops the fire extinguisher .
LISA: Shut it off !
PADDY: See ya later , lads .
SMITH: Careful . Once it 's wet I do n't know what it can do .
O'SHEA: It did n't burn .
LISA: Is it dead ?
SMITH: OK , it 's an alien .
O'SHEA: You vicious little fu !
LISA: Ah ! Jesus ! O'Shea !
O'SHEA: We need to kill it .
SMITH: No ! You ca n't ! It 's the scientific discovery of our time , imagine all that we could learn
SMITH: I think we got it .
PATS SMITH: Good man .
SMITH: It 's still moving .
LISA: We need to get help .
O'SHEA: They 'll never make it across the water .
LISA: If those eggs hatch , with no whales to eat
SMITH: they 'll head in land to feed .
O'SHEA: Finishing each other 's sentences now ?
LISA: What ?
O'SHEA: Nothing .
PADDY: They 're hatching .
O'SHEA: It took three of us to get that thing off me .
PADDY: I woulda helped but I 've a bad ack , gives me shocking pain , you know yourself .
O'SHEA: How are you still alive ?
PADDY: Diet and exercise .
O'SHEA: No , when that thing attacked you . You should be laid out in a box ight now , but you 're not . What makes you so special ?
PADDY: I was always lucky .
SMITH: Must n't have liked your blood much .
LISA: What have you been eating ? O'Shea stills , hearing that question .
TO PADDY: You were drunk !
DR GLEESON: Grabbers ?
SMITH: No , it 's a cryptozoological amphibious sanguivore .
LISA: Not a tiger .
DR GLEESON: Where are you getting all these heads ?
O'SHEA: Come on .
DR GLEESON: This place has gone to the dogs .
O'SHEA: They 're like leeches , right ? They feed off your blood . Well when one of them bit Paddy , it almost died , why ?
PADDY: Slow down for fuck sake .
LISA: Because Paddy was so intoxicated his blood-alcohol level was toxic .
O'SHEA: Exactly . If we taint our blood with booze , we 're poisonous to eat .
SMITH: In theory .
PADDY: And you told me to cut back .
O'SHEA: We have just one night where we have to deal with this on our own . Tomorrow , we 'll be sorted . We 'll get off the island , they 'll nuke the beaches or whatever they do , ut all we have to worry about is tonight . And it 's simple . We have a lock-in . We stay out of the rain and we drink . We ca n't stop them coming but we can be ready .
BRIAN: What ?
SMITH: A hostile migra
DR GLEESON: Grabbers .
SMITH: God sake .
BRIAN: Are ye for real ?
PADDY: Are we for real ? Are YOU for real ? Show him .
BRIAN: That ? Sure you could kill that with a hammer .
O'SHEA: That 's just the tip of the blood sucking iceberg .
CONVINCED: Grabbers .
SMITH: I give up . Yes , a Grabber . Smith covers the beaker again .
DR GLEESON: But if its allergic to booze ca n't we just hose 'em with vodka or some shit ?
O'SHEA: No , that wo n't work .
BRIAN: How do you know ?
SMITH: Because alcohol is a poison . It needs to be ingested to take affect . Also to preserve specimens I keep them in an alcohol based solution . Just like with this one , ight now . Smith taps the tea cosy .
BRIAN: It 's filled with ?
SMITH: Yep .
PADDY: Can you drink it ?
DR GLEESON: So what if we sprayed whiskey in its mouth ?
PADDY: Feck that . A waste of whiskey .
LISA: If you want to get that close to it , good luck .
UNA: What 's going on here then ?
BRIAN: Just discussing something .
UNA: Looks like you 're plotting something .
O'SHEA: No , no . More like planning .
UNA: Huh . Carry on . She leaves , grinning .
BRIAN: Great . It 's her birthday next week now she thinks this is something for her .
DR GLEESON: She 's in for a shock .
O'SHEA: Listen , the only people that know about this are us and it 's got ta stay that way or we 'll have a panic on our hands . The group confer , sharing glances .
LISA: How drunk are we talking here ?
SMITH: Paddy levels of drunkenness . They laugh loudly .
DR GLEESON: You 're gone off your game , boy .
LISA: No offence but I do n't think my ody can handle Paddy levels .
PADDY: It takes years of practice .
BRIAN: If those things do come for us , we 'd be lambs to the slaughter if ombed out of our brains .
LISA: And with everyone hammered there 's no one in a fit state to call the shots . The non-alcoholic shots .
DR GLEESON: Yeah but single someone out and they 'll be sought as the only meat on the menu .
LISA: But what 's to keep us safe from ourselves , forget what 's outside , we could fall over and break ou necks trying to conga . Statistics prove put a large number of people in a confined space , ply them with ooze and
PADDY: you 've got a hooley .
LISA: That 's not what it said .
O'SHEA: This will work . And I 'll keep order . I wo n't be drinking .
LISA: You ? We 'll both do it .
SMITH: That would put you both at risk . I suggest it 's just O'Shea .
O'SHEA: Thanks .
TO LISA: Only one of us need risk it and I know these people and this island etter than you . It should be me .
SMITH: I agree .
LISA: I see what you 're doing here but have you forgotten you 're a dependent alcoholic organising a piss up in a brewery ! I 'll do it . It 'll be easier .
O'SHEA: Lisa , I 'm good to no one when I drink . I know that . So do you . I can do this .
PADDY: It 's gon na rain any minute .
LISA: OK . But just so you know , I do n't drink . I 've never even been drunk . I do n't know if I can .
O'SHEA: Of course you can . And you 'll be the best drunken Guard this country 's ever seen . You 'll probably get promoted .
LISA: Ah stop .
SMITH: Right , if we 're doing this we 'll need a blood test from a healthy subject . Lisa , you 're the fittest person here .
BLUSHES: You charmer . It 's true , though .
O'SHEA: Brian , I want a table of everything Paddy had last night .
BRIAN: What night was last night ?
PADDY: Saturday night .
LISA: Oh you got ta be joking me !
PADDY: Oh it was a big one .
BRIAN: Comin ' right up .
LISA: He never liked me as much as her . She was the talented one , Daddy 's little girl . That bitch ! O'Shea holds her beer hand steady .
O'SHEA: Come on . Three fingers .
LISA: But I got you guys . I love you all . Even you .
BRIAN: She 's langers .
O'SHEA: There , that 's everything .
PADDY: I also had a snifter of
BRIAN: What 's that ?
PADDY: A little home brew .
BRIAN: You bring potcheen into my bar ?
PADDY: A bird never flew on one wing .
O'SHEA: When this is over we need to talk .
PADDY: Ah come off it , this could save all our lives yet . Paddy pours a drop for Lisa .
BRIAN: I 'll take that .
PADDY: You will in me shit .
O'SHEA: Paddy .
LISA: I need to pee .
O'SHEA: Now the tainted blood .
BRIAN: If you 're right , this will kill it ?
O'SHEA: Blow .
READS: Point two .
DR GLEESON: Holy Christ !
O'SHEA: OK , now we know what we got ta do . Keep our blood alcohol levels at point two . The group 's horrified , except for Paddy .
TO PADDY: You unnatural eejit . You 're what 'll kill us . Point two ? !
SMITH: How are we going to determine that ased on each person 's body mass index ?
DR GLEESON: You 're looking at up to ten pints each depending on height and weight .
BRIAN: We 'll have to do shots . Properly tear the arse out of it .
O'SHEA: So lets do it .
A THOUGHT: Who 's going to pay for all this by the way ?
FR POTTS: Mass has ended , go in peace to love and serve the Lord . Amen .
O'SHEA: Is this everyone ?
BRIAN: It 's Fr Potts last mass , so everyone that did n't leave yesterday for the thing in Dungary .
O'SHEA: Father , do you mind if I say a few words ?
FR POTTS: Go mad . O'Shea takes to the pulpit .
O'SHEA: Can I have your attention please ?
MAMIE: Oh here we go .
O'SHEA: Folks , just a quick announcement , at Maher 's Tavern tonight we 're having a bit of a shindig and you 're all coming to join us fo what will be a great night 's craic ! A wall of silence .
UNA: You 're throwing a party ?
O'SHEA: Yeah .
UNA: Why ?
O'SHEA: Who needs a reason to have a laugh ?
LISA: It 's a welcome party for me .
UNA: A welcome party ? But you 're leaving in a fortnight .
LISA: So it 's a goodbye party . Whatever .
UNA: You only just got here .
TO O'SHEA: What 's her problem ?
O'SHEA: What we mean to say is A FISHERMAN rises to leave .
LISA: Hey bucko ! Where are you going ? This party 's for your benefit . And all of you are gon na be there too . It 's the law !
FISHERMAN: Are you coddin ' us , love ?
LISA: What 's your name ? He wilts .

BRIAN: What ? ! HILDA , a stout woman , grabs her coat .
HILDA: Sold !

LISA: Crap .
DR GLEESON: I 've got a nail-gun . THWACK ! He nails a board of wood .
PADDY: I 've got a hurley and a pellet gun .

PADDY: Shoot pellets . But I do n't have any pellets .

LISA: I dunno , you know ?
MUFFLED: Kinda . She watches his reaction and stifles a burp .
O'SHEA: How much have you had ?
LISA: Not enough to fancy you .
O'SHEA: Then keep drinking . O'Shea puts the breathalyser in her mouth .
LISA: That 's it , is it ? You think I think I fancy you . That 's the sitchuashun we got , huh ?
OFF BREATHALYSER: No more for you .
LISA: Well I do . So whatcha wan na do 'bout it ? Arrest me ? She smiles coyly . Or tries to .
O'SHEA: You know as flattering as it is to hear a beautiful drunk slurring he feelings for me , now 's not the time .
LISA: Why do you drink so much , Ciarán ?
O'SHEA: For the craic .
LISA: Yeah right , and I work everyday 'cause I 'm driven .
O'SHEA: You 're too hard on yourself .
LISA: I feel like I 've known you fo years . I do n't know why .
O'SHEA: Maybe because I put years onto people .
LISA: Yeah . That 's true .
O'SHEA: My what ?
LISA: Una told me , how she died . I 'm so sorry .
O'SHEA: Una said what ? Of all the stories . Una is the biggest gossip going . You should n't listen to her . No one died . We just we did n't work out .
LISA: Oh . Ah shite , I 'm sorry .
O'SHEA: You 're grand .

LISA: You 're worse . O'Shea hustles every one out of the kitchen .
TO O'SHEA: We 're dry .
PADDY: We 're what ? !
BRIAN: Unless someone goes outside to change the kegs , we 're done drinking for the night . Paddy 's devastated .
PADDY: No ! NO ! He thumps the counter .
O'SHEA: Folks , listen carefully . We 're moving this party upstairs .
FR POTTS: Ah now , what kind of party is this ?
O'SHEA: It 's just a precaution .

O'SHEA: You ca n't . No one can .
FR POTTS: Why ?
LISA: It 's raining . People look , huh ?
FISHERMAN: Someone better tell us what 's eally going on here ? Right now !
UNA: This party is n't for me , is it , Brian ? ! You lied to me !
TO PADDY: You see you ! This is your fault . You brought that thing on the island .

PADDY: He flew ? !
O'SHEA: Everyone , upstairs ! Now !
FR POTTS: And what in the name of fuck were those things ?
PADDY: Jumpers .
FR POTTS: Ha ?
PADDY: They jump .
O'SHEA: Has anyone been bitten ? You have n't been bitten because of the alcohol you 've been drinking . They 're allergic to drunk people . So there 's no need to panic , we 're safe up here . Has anyone got a mobile on them ?
MAMIE: Father , is it the apocalypse ?
FR POTTS: Jesus , I hope not .
O'SHEA: We 'll be fine !
BRIAN: It 's just linen and cleaning stuff . Nothing we can really use .
FISHERMAN: Why ca n't ya just shoot it ? Ye guys must have some guns . Brian closes the closet .
O'SHEA: We 're the Gardai . Not the LAPD . An Garda Siochana will succeed not y force of arms or numbers , but on their moral authority as servants of the people .
FISHERMAN: We 're bolloxed .
BRIAN: Yep . Brian shuts the door .
O'SHEA: Something 's not right . It ca n't be that hungry . Eavesdropping , Paddy chimes in .
PADDY: It 's the female . It 's following her scent . Sure did n't she slime you in the lab ? Like with me athroom and Tadhg Murphy .
O'SHEA: Tadhg Murphy 's dead !
LISA: And so 's his wife .
BRIAN: It 's swinging one of Tommy Riordan 's sheep at the door .
LISA: My cat does that , then leaves it on the doorstep as a present .
PADDY: A mating ritual .
O'SHEA: What the hell does that mean ?
PADDY: It 'll try to mount you , somehow . Failing that it 'll most likely rip you limb from limb in frustration .
O'SHEA: Grand . Ah sure what can ya do .
LISA: Play hard to get .
HILDA: Oh , God . What does it want ?
UNA: It 's not gon na stop , is it ? We wo n't survive the night . We 're on a sinking ship . Brian breathalyses himself sorrowfully .
O'SHEA: What 's your reading ?
BRIAN: Too drunk to drive a car but not drunk enough . We 're sobering up . All of us . O'Shea nods tensely .
UNA: We ca n't just sit here . It 'll ing the walls down around us .
PADDY: What if we threw a bomb at it ?
BRIAN: Have you got semtex on you ?
PADDY: Not on me , no .
BRIAN: How about we like push it off a cliff or something .
UNA: Or electrocute it ? I do n't know .
PADDY: I vote we feed it Father Potts . Unless it eats shit it 'll choke to death .
FR POTTS: I beg your pardon . Fr Potts perks up from the darker corner .
PADDY: Feck , is he in here ? I was joking , Father . I apologise . Fr Potts disregards him .
UNA: If we ca n't destroy it , what can we do ?
O'SHEA: What about the phones ? Fr Potts shakes his head . Nothing .
UNA: What do you mean ?
O'SHEA: We need to keep it away from water . Dry it out somehow .
PADDY: Look outside .
O'SHEA: There 's got to be some way we can stop it , fight fire with fire .
LISA: The Grabber ! Not the Grabber- Grabber , the mechanical one ! The big yoke , with the arm and the thing and you know ? That big aul whatchamacallit you crush things with . The feckin ' thing at Cooney 's site ! What 's it called ?
PADDY: A Grabber ?
LISA: Exactly ! With that thing you could grab it , hoist it up and trap it . It 's raining now but it has to stop some time right ? And when it does it 'd be stuck . Once the sun comes up it 'd cook . That 'd dry it out .
PADDY: You think you can catch that thing ?
UNA: Sure 't is lepping about all ove the shop .
BRIAN: You 'd need some sort of ?
O'SHEA: A death trap .
TO BRIAN: Have you got the keys to you truck ? Brian checks his pockets .
BRIAN: They 'd be in the kitchen . On the table , I think .
O'SHEA: I need them .
UNA: You ca n't go downstairs , those things will tear you to pieces .
BRIAN: She 's right .
PADDY: You might not get past them , but someone else could .
FR POTTS: You 'd be talking about the drunkest person we got .
O'SHEA: Absolutely not , it 's too risky . Paddy you go .
PADDY: What ? Feck off ! Brian should go .
BRIAN: I could try
UNA: Not a hope .
LISA: Slow down there . I 'll do it .
O'SHEA: No . It 's too dangerous .
LISA: Which is exactly why you 'll want the best drunken guard this country 's ever seen . Right ?
O'SHEA: If you get in trouble . Pull the trigger .
LISA: Oooh , savage .
O'SHEA: Careful .
BRIAN: You missed . Paddy throws Brian a withering look .
O'SHEA: Just get the keys and come right ack . I 'll do the rest . Fr Potts blesses her .
LISA: Got it . Just the keys .
UNA: Look what they 've done to the carpets !
O'SHEA: Shush ! ! Keep your voice down !
PADDY: She 's a goner . O'Shea looks at Paddy , then at Brian .
BRIAN: How are you gon na get to the truck ?
O'SHEA: Run very fast .
UNA: Love , you 're not that fast .
FR POTTS: You 'll need a decoy .
PADDY: I got it . If its you it wants , then we give it what it wants . We fashion a dummy , dress it up like ait and confuse the shite out of it . It wo n't know where to look when there 's two of you .
FR POTTS: And how the hell do we make a dummy ? O'Shea looks at Paddy , he likes that idea .
O'SHEA: Improvise .
LISA: Focus .
UNA: I love that song .
PADDY: What is she doing at all ?
O'SHEA: Hurry .
LISA: UH FIRE ! FIRE !
UNA: Do you smell smoke ?
FR POTTS: We 're going up in flames !
O'SHEA: Where is she ?
BRIAN: You got ta go now .
O'SHEA: I need those keys .
BRIAN: We ca n't wait , son .
PADDY: Yoohoo ! Come and get me , you otten bastard !
BRIAN: Run , O'Shea , run !
O'SHEA: Lisa ?
LISA: Would ya come on for fuck sake !
O'SHEA: GO !
LISA: I 'm breaking so many laws . Drinking on duty . Driving unde the influence . Speeding . Driving without lights on .
O'SHEA: PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON !
SHE DOES: Ah that 's better .
PADDY: Good luck , boy .
BRIAN: Let 's bury the hatchet , Paddy into the heads of those feckin ' things !
PADDY: Jumpers .
UNA: Come on !
O'SHEA: It 's following me , so you get the crusher and I 'll lure it into position .
LISA: It 's gone .
O'SHEA: What is ?
LISA: The crusher , the JCB . It 's gone . It 's not here anymore .
O'SHEA: I know .
LISA: What are we gon na do now ?
O'SHEA: Fuck knows .
LISA: I 've got an idea too .
O'SHEA: What 's your idea ?
LISA: Why , what are you thinking ?
LISA: Wait ! We 're not ready !
O'SHEA: Run !
LISA: Give me the keys !
LISA: Breaking and entering . Jacking a stolen vehicle
O'SHEA: Come on , you langer . Just a little closer . Move . Hey , you want me , you 're going have to come across and get
LISA: Get away from him , you !
O'SHEA: You took your sweet time . Lisa reveals Paddy 's potcheen bottle .
LISA: I think this calls for a celebration .
O'SHEA: Sláinte .
LISA: Oh shut your hole . She fires !
O'SHEA: Jesus , you 're dangerous .
THRILLED: I know ! They laugh .
LISA: You look like crap .
O'SHEA: So do you .
LISA: Here .
O'SHEA: You know if you lived here you 'd be home already . Lisa absorbs the vista before her .
LISA: Home of the Erin Island Grabbers . It 's gon na get mental round here .
O'SHEA: I 'll need all the help I can get .
LISA: You want to get some breakfast ?
O'SHEA: Yeah .
LISA: First , lets get out of these wet clothes .
O'SHEA: Sounds good .
BEN: - and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question What is the purpose of these years , the purpose for all this demanding work , the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us ? Were there NOT a purpose , then all of these past years of struggle , of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless . But , of course , there is a purpose and I must tell it to you . I ask you to remembe this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever .

MRS. ROBINSON: Yes .
BEN: Well , why ca n't you just lock the doors and go to bed ?

BEN: What do you mean ?
MRS. ROBINSON: You 've known me nearly all of your life . You must have formed some opinion .
BEN: Well - I 've always thought that you were a very - nice - person .
MRS. ROBINSON: Did you know I was an alcoholic ?
BEN: What ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Did you know that ?
BEN: Look - I think I should be going -
MRS. ROBINSON: Sit down , Benjamin .
BEN: Mrs. Robinson - if you do n't mind my saying so - this conversation is getting a little strange . Now I 'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and -
MRS. ROBINSON: No .
BEN: What ?
MRS. ROBINSON: My husband will be back quite late .
BEN: Oh my God .
MRS. ROBINSON: Pardon ?
BEN: Oh no , Mrs. Robinson , oh no .
MRS. ROBINSON: What 's wrong ?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson , you did n't - I mean you did n't expect -
MRS. ROBINSON: What ?
BEN: I mean - you did n't really think that I would do something like that .
MRS. ROBINSON: Like what ?
BEN: What do you think ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well I do n't know .
BEN: For God 's sake , Mrs. Robinson , here we are , you 've got me into your house . You give me a drink . You put on music , now you start opening up you personal life to me and tell me your husband wo n't be home for hours .
MRS. ROBINSON: So ?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson - you are trying to seduce me . There is a pause . She looks at him .
MRS. ROBINSON: Why no . I had n't thought of it . I feel rather flattered that you -
BEN: Mrs. Robinson , will you forgive me for what I just said ?
MRS. ROBINSON: It 's all right .
BEN: It 's not all right , it 's the worst thing I 've ever said to anyone .
MRS. ROBINSON: Sit down .
BEN: Please forgive me . Because I like you . I do n't think of you that way . But I 'm mixed up .
MRS. ROBINSON: All right . Now finish your drink .
BEN: Mrs. Robinson , it makes me sick that I said that to you .
MRS. ROBINSON: We 'll forget it right now . Finish your drink .
BEN: What is wrong with me ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Have you ever seen Elaine 's portrait ?
BEN: Her portrait ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes .
BEN: No .
MRS. ROBINSON: We had it done last Christmas . Would you like to see it ?
BEN: Very much .
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin ?
BEN: Yes ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Will you unzip my dress ? He steps back .
BEN: Oh . Well , goodnight .
MRS. ROBINSON: Wo n't you unzip my dress ?
BEN: I 'd rather not , Mrs. Robinson .
MRS. ROBINSON: If you still think I 'm trying to seduce you -
BEN: No , I do n't . But I just feel a little funny .
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin - you 've known me all your life .
BEN: I know that . But I 'm -
MRS. ROBINSON: Come on . She turns her back .
BEN: Right . Ben walks toward the door .
MRS. ROBINSON: What are you so scared of ?
BEN: I 'm not scared , Mrs. Robinson .
MRS. ROBINSON: Then why do you keep running away ?
BEN: Because you 're going to bed . I do n't think I should be up here .
MRS. ROBINSON: Have n't you ever seen anybody in a slip before ?
BEN: Yes , I have - He looks up at the portrait of Elaine .
MRS. ROBINSON: What if he did ?
BEN: Well , it would look pretty funny , would n't it ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Do n't you think he trusts us together ?
BEN: Of course he does . But he might get the wrong idea . Anyone might .
MRS. ROBINSON: I do n't see why . I 'm twice as old as you are . How could anyone think -
BEN: But they would ! Do n't you see ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin - I 'm not trying to seduce you . I wish you 'd -
BEN: I know that . But please , Mrs. Robinson . This is difficult for me .
MRS. ROBINSON: Why is it ?
BEN: Because I am confused about things . I ca n't tell what I 'm imagining . I ca n't tell what 's real . I ca n't -
MRS. ROBINSON: Would you like me to seduce you ?
BEN: What ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Is that what you 're trying to tell me ?
BEN: I 'm going home now . I apologize for what I said . I hope you can forget it . But I 'm going home ight now .
BEN: Yes .
MRS. ROBINSON: I really do n't want to put this on again . Wo n't you bring it up ?
BEN: Where is it ?
MRS. ROBINSON: On that chair in the hall . She walks out of the shot .
BEN: Mrs. Robinson ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Do n't be nervous .
BEN: Get away from that door .
MRS. ROBINSON: I want to say something first .
BEN: Jesus Christ !
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin - I want you to know I 'm available to you . If you wo n't sleep with me this time -
BEN: Oh my God .
MRS. ROBINSON: If you wo n't sleep with me this time , Benjamin , I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we 'll make some kind of arrangement .
BEN: Let me out !
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you understand what I said ?
BEN: Yes . Yes . Let me out !
MRS. ROBINSON: Because I find you very attractive and any time -
BEN: Yes , sir !
MR. ROBINSON: Swell . I appreciate it .
BEN: She 's upstairs . She wanted me to wait down here till you got home .
MR. ROBINSON: Standing guard over the old castle , are you ?
BEN: Yes , sir . Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben 's glass .
MR. ROBINSON: Here . It looks like you need a refill .
BEN: Oh no .
MR. ROBINSON: What ?
BEN: I 've got to go .
MR. ROBINSON: Is anything wrong ? You look a little shaken up .
BEN: No . No - I 'm just - I 'm just a little worried about my future . I 'm a little upset about my future . Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him .
MR. ROBINSON: Come on . Let 's have a nightcap together .
BEN: Thank you very much , sir .
MR. ROBINSON: Ben - how old are you now ?
BEN: Twenty . I 'll be twenty-one next week .
MR. ROBINSON: That 's a hell of a good age to be .
BEN: Thank you .
MR. ROBINSON: I wish I was that age again . Because , Ben -
BEN: Sir ?
MR. ROBINSON: You 'll never be young again .
BEN: I know .
MR. ROBINSON: Ben , can I say something to you ?
BEN: What ?
MR. ROBINSON: How long have we known each other now ? Ben shakes his head .
BEN: Quite a while .
MR. ROBINSON: I 've watched you grow up , Ben .
BEN: Yes , sir .
MR. ROBINSON: In many ways I feel as though you were my own son .
BEN: Thank you .
MR. ROBINSON: So I hope you wo n't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice .
BEN: I 'd like to hear it .
MR. ROBINSON: Ben - I think - I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to . Ben nods .
MRS. ROBINSON: Do n't get up . Ben sits .
MR. ROBINSON: I was just telling Ben here he ought to sow a few wild oats . Have a good time while he can . You think that 's sound advice ? Mrs. Robinson nods .
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes , I do .
BEN: I 've got to go . He stands . Mr. Robinson stands up with him .
MR. ROBINSON: You have yourself a few flings this summer . I bet you 're quite a ladies ' man .
BEN: Oh no .
MR. ROBINSON: What ? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off . Does n't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes , he does . They start out of the sunroom .
MR. ROBINSON: Oh say - Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday .
BEN: Oh yes .
MR. ROBINSON: Ben - I want you to give her a call .
BEN: I will .
MR. ROBINSON: Great .
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin ?
BEN: Yes .
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you for taking me home . Ben nods .
MR. BRADDOCK: Hey , over there I mean you ! Your attention please !

MR. BRADDOCK: - what was I saying ?
MRS. ARNOLD: Feature attraction .
MR. BRADDOCK: Right . Hey - I 'm glad to see you 're paying attention . A feature attraction that will be one of the most astounding events ever to take place in this particular backyard . They all laugh and some applaud .
MR. ARNOLD: Let 's get on with the show !
MR. BRADDOCK: Just hang on a minute because I have a few words to say -
MR. ARNOLD: You always do .
BEN'S VOICE: Dad - could we just talk about this for a second ?
MR. BRADDOCK: Twenty-one-years-old , ladies and gentlemen ; four of those years spent accomplishing some ather extraordinary things at one of our nation 's leading seats of learning -
MR. ARNOLD: Bring him out !
MR. BRADDOCK: I ca n't hold them much longer , Ben . You better get out here .
BEN'S VOICE: I 'd like to discuss this .
MR. BRADDOCK: This boy - I 'm sorry - this young man - is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halping- ham Award Scholar - but before he does - Mr. Braddock darts back to the window .
BEN'S VOICE: Dad - can you listen -
MR. BRADDOCK: I 'll give you ten seconds . He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present - and it better work or I 'm out over two hundred ucks - so let 's hear it for -
BEN: Mrs. Robinson - I do n't quite know how to put this -

MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin - do you find me undesirable ?
BEN: Oh no , Mrs. Robinson . I think - I think you 're the most attractive of all my parents ' friends . I just do n't think we could possibly
MRS. ROBINSON: Are you afraid of me ?
BEN: No - but look - maybe we could do something else together , Mrs. Robinson - would you like to go to a movie .
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin , is this your first time ?
BEN: Is this - what ?
MRS. ROBINSON: It is , is n't it ? It is you first time .
BEN: That 's a laugh , Mrs. Robinson . That 's really a laugh . Ha ha .
MRS. ROBINSON: You can admit that , ca n't you ?
BEN: Are you kidding ?
MRS. ROBINSON: It 's nothing to be ashamed of -
BEN: Wait a minute !
MRS. ROBINSON: On your first time -
BEN: Who said it was my first time .
MRS. ROBINSON: That you 're afraid -
BEN: Wait a minute .
MRS. ROBINSON: - of bring - inadequate - I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way -
BEN: INADEQUATE !
BEN: Do n't move .
BEN'S VOICE: Well - I would say that I 'm just drifting .
BEN: - here - in the pool .
MR. BRADDOCK: Why ?
BEN: Well - it 's very comfortable - just to drift here .
MR. BRADDOCK: Have you thought about graduate school ?
BEN: No .
MR. BRADDOCK: Would you mind telling me then - what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ?
BEN: You got me .
MR. BRADDOCK: Now listen , Ben . I think it 's a very good thing that a young man - after he 's done some very good work - should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock .
MRS. BRADDOCK: The Robinson 's are here .
MR. ROBINSON: Hi , Ben . What are you doing with yourself these days ?
BEN: Oh - not too much . Taking it easy .
MR. ROBINSON: That 's what I 'd do if I could . Nothing wrong with that . Hey Ben , Elaine 's coming down from Berkeley soon . I want you to call her up this time .
BEN: I will .
MR. ROBINSON: Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Say hello to Mrs. Robinson , Benjamin .
BEN: Hello , Mrs. Robinson .
MRS. ROBINSON: Hello , Benjamin .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Can I talk to you a minute ?
BEN: Sure .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Benjamin ? I 'm going to ask you something but you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want .
BEN: What ?
MRS. BRADDOCK: Well I 'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night .
BEN: When I go off ?
MRS. BRADDOCK: You do n't have to tell me if you do n't want .
BEN: No , I do . I want to tell you . There is a pause .
MRS. BRADDOCK: What else ?
BEN: Nothing else .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Well you do n't drive around from midnight until noon the next day , Benjamin .
BEN: Oh , no .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Then what do you do ? Do you meet someone ?
BEN: Meet someone ? She nods .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Well this is your business , Benjamin . If you -
BEN: No wait . Wait . She stops .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Benjamin , I 'm not going to pry into your affairs , but I 'd ather you did n't say anything at all than be dishonest . Goodnight , Benjamin .
BEN: Well , wait . She looks at him .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Because I know you do n't drive around for twelve hours .
BEN: Oh . Well , I do n't . Shall I tell you what I do ?
MRS. BRADDOCK: Not if you do n't want to .
BEN: I do .
MRS. BRADDOCK: But I do n't want you to make up something .
BEN: I 'm not . But I 'm - I 'm not very proud of what I do . I usually get kind of drunk . I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk . Then I take a hotel oom . So I wo n't have to drive home on the freeway . I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after -
MRS. BRADDOCK: Goodnight , Benjamin .
BEN: You believe me , do n't you ?
MRS. BRADDOCK: No .
BEN: You do n't ? She shakes her head .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Goodnight .
BEN'S VOICE: Wait a minute .
BEN: Wait a minute . Sit down a minute .
MRS. ROBINSON: If you want .
BEN: Good . I mean are we dead o something ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well I just do n't think we have much to say to each other .
BEN: All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together .
MRS. ROBINSON: Are you tired of it ?
BEN: I 'm not . No . But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well what do you want to talk about ?
BEN: Anything . Anything at all .
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences ?
BEN: Oh my God .
MRS. ROBINSON: Well ?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson . If that 's the best we can do let 's just get the god- damn clothes off and She reaches for her shoe .
MRS. ROBINSON: How about art .
BEN: Art . That 's a good subject . You start it off .
MRS. ROBINSON: You start it off . I do n't know anything about it .
BEN: Oh .
MRS. ROBINSON: Do n't you ?
BEN: Yes I do . I know quite a bit about it .
MRS. ROBINSON: Go ahead then .
BEN: Art . Well what do you want to know about it . She shrugs .
MRS. ROBINSON: Neither .
BEN: You 're not interested in art ?
MRS. ROBINSON: No .
BEN: Then why do you want to talk about it ?
MRS. ROBINSON: I do n't . Ben nods and looks at the rug .
BEN: No . Think of another topic . Tell me what you did today .
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you really want me to ?
BEN: Yes I do .
MRS. ROBINSON: I got up . Ben starts shaking his head .
BEN: Yes . But you might try and spice it up with a little originality .
MRS. ROBINSON: I got up . I ate breakfast and went shopping . During the after- noon I read a novel .
BEN: What one .
MRS. ROBINSON: What ?
BEN: What novel did you read .
MRS. ROBINSON: I do n't remember . Ben nods .
BEN: There !
MRS. ROBINSON: What ?
BEN: Your husband ! Mrs. Robinson ! There 's something we could have a conversation about .
MRS. ROBINSON: Him ?
BEN: I mean everything . I do n't know anything about how you - how you work this . I do n't know how you get out of the house at night . I do n't know the risk involved .
MRS. ROBINSON: There is n't any .
BEN: There 's no risk ? She shakes her head .
MRS. ROBINSON: I walk out .
BEN: You walk right out the door . She nods .
MRS. ROBINSON: He 's asleep .
BEN: Always ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin , this is n't a very interesting topic .
BEN: Please . Now tell me . How do you know he wo n't wake up sometime and follow you .
MRS. ROBINSON: Because he takes sleeping pills . He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock .
BEN: But what about the noise from the car . What if -
MRS. ROBINSON: The driveway 's on my side of the house .
BEN: We 're talking .
MRS. ROBINSON: What ?
BEN: We 're talking , Mrs. Robinson . We 're talking .
MRS. ROBINSON: Calm down , Benjamin .
BEN: Now let 's keep going here .
MRS. ROBINSON: Can I undress and talk at the same time ?
BEN: Right .
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you .
BEN: Now . You say the driveway 's on your side of the house . So I guess you do n't sleep in the same room .
MRS. ROBINSON: We do n't .
BEN: So you do n't - I mean I do n't like to seem like I 'm prying ut I guess you do n't sleep together or anything .
MRS. ROBINSON: No we do n't .
BEN: Well how long has this been going on .
MRS. ROBINSON: About five years .
BEN: Oh no . Are you kidding me ?
MRS. ROBINSON: No .
BEN: You have not slept with you husband for five years ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Now and then . He geats drunk a few times a year .
BEN: How many times a year .
MRS. ROBINSON: On New Year 's Eve . Sometimes on his birthday .
BEN: Man , is this interesting .
MRS. ROBINSON: Is it ?
BEN: So you do n't love him . You would n't say you -
MRS. ROBINSON: We 've talked enough , Benjamin .
BEN: Wait a minute . So you would n't say you loved him .
MRS. ROBINSON: Not exactly .
BEN: But you do n't hate him .
MRS. ROBINSON: No , Benjamin . I do n't hate him . Unhook my blouse .
BEN: Well how do you feel about him , then ?
MRS. ROBINSON: I do n't .
BEN: Well that 's kind of a bad situation then , is n't it ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Is it ?
BEN: I mean it does n't sound like it could be much worse . If you hated him at least you 'd hate him . She nods and takes off her blouse .
MRS. ROBINSON: No .
BEN: What ?
MRS. ROBINSON: I never did , Benjamin . Now let 's -
BEN: Well , wait a minute . You married him . She nods .
MRS. ROBINSON: See if you can guess .
BEN: Well I ca n't .
MRS. ROBINSON: Think real hard , Benjamin .
BEN: I ca n't see why you did , unless you did n't have to marry him or anything , did you ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Do n't tell Elaine .
BEN: Oh no . You had to marry him ecause you got pregnant ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Are you shocked ?
BEN: Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who
MRS. ROBINSON: All right . Now let 's get to bed .
BEN: Wait a minute . Wait a minute . So how did it happen ?
MRS. ROBINSON: What ?
BEN: I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Not particularly .
BEN: Was he a law student at the time ? She nods .
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes .
BEN: At college .
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes .
BEN: What was your major ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Why are you asking me all this ?
BEN: Because I 'm interested , Mrs. Robinson . Now what was your major subject at college ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Art .
BEN: Art ? She nods .
MRS. ROBINSON: Kind of .
BEN: Well how did it happen ?
MRS. ROBINSON: How do you think .
BEN: I mean did he take you up to his room with him ? Did you go to a hotel ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin , what does it possibly matter ?
BEN: I 'm curious .
MRS. ROBINSON: We 'd go to his car .
BEN: Oh no . In the car you did it ?
MRS. ROBINSON: I do n't think we were the first . Ben thinks for a moment .
BEN: What kind of car was it ?
MRS. ROBINSON: What ?
BEN: Do you remember the make of the car ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Oh my God .
BEN: Really . I want to know .
MRS. ROBINSON: It was a Ford , Benjamin .
BEN: A Ford ! A Ford ! Goddamnit , a Ford ! That 's great !
MRS. ROBINSON: That 's enough .
BEN: So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford . There is a pause .
MRS. ROBINSON: Do n't talk about Elaine .
BEN: Do n't talk about Elaine ?
MRS. ROBINSON: No .
BEN: Why not ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Because I do n't want you to . She walks to the bed .
BEN: Well why do n't you ?
MRS. ROBINSON: There 's nothing to tell .
BEN: Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden ? Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows .
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin , do n't you ever take that girl out . Ben looks at her .
BEN: Well look . I have no intention of taking her out .
MRS. ROBINSON: Good .
BEN: I was just kidding around .
MRS. ROBINSON: Good .
BEN: But why should n't I ?
MRS. ROBINSON: I have my reasons .
BEN: Then let 's hear them .
MRS. ROBINSON: No .
BEN: Let 's hear your reasons , Mrs. Robinson . Because I think I know what they are . She pulls the covers down .
MRS. ROBINSON: Let 's drop it .
BEN: We 're not dropping it . Now that 's the reason , is n't it ? I 'm a dirty degenerate , are n't I ? I 'm not fit to -
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin ?
BEN: I 'm good enough for you but I 'm too slimy to associate with your daughter . That 's it , is n't it ? IS N'T IT ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes .
BEN: You go to hell . You go straight to hell , Mrs. Robinson . Do you think I 'm proud of myself ? Do you think I 'm proud of this ?
MRS. ROBINSON: I would n't know .
BEN: Well , I 'm not .
MRS. ROBINSON: You 're not .
BEN: No sir . I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken- down alcoholic !
MRS. ROBINSON: I see .
BEN: And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure oredom , then you 're all wrong . She nods .
MRS. ROBINSON: Are you ?
BEN: You 're goddamn right I am .
MRS. ROBINSON: That 's how you feel about me . He nods .
BEN: Now do n't start this .
MRS. ROBINSON: What ?
BEN: Do n't start acting hurt .
MRS. ROBINSON: Do n't you expect me to be a little hurt ?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson , you stand there and tell me I 'm not good enough for your daughter .
MRS. ROBINSON: Did I say that ?
BEN: Of course you did . She shakes her head .
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin , I want to apologize to you if that 's the impression you got .
BEN: Well two minutes ago you told me I was n't good enough fo your daughter . Now you say you 're sorry I got that impression .
MRS. ROBINSON: I did n't mean it . I do n't think you 'd be right for each other . But I would never say you were n't as good a person as she is .
BEN: You would n't .
MRS. ROBINSON: Of course I would n't . Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet .
BEN: What are you doing ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well it 's pretty obvious you do n't want me around any more .
BEN: Well look - I was kind of upset there . I 'm sorry I said those things .
MRS. ROBINSON: If that 's how you feel -
BEN: But it 's not .
MRS. ROBINSON: That 's all right . I think I can understand why I 'm disgusting to you .
BEN: Oh no . Look - I like you . I would n't keep coming here if I did n't like you .
MRS. ROBINSON: But if it 's sickening for you -
BEN: It 's not ! I enjoy it ! I look forward to it . It 's the one thing I have to look forward to .
MRS. ROBINSON: You do n't have to say that .
BEN: Well I would n't . I would neve say it if it was n't true .
MRS. ROBINSON: May I stay then ?
BEN: Yes . Please . I want you to .
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you .
BEN: Well do n't thank me , because I want you to . There is a long pause .
MRS. ROBINSON: But you wo n't ever take out Elaine , will you ? I want you to promise me that . There is another long pause .
BEN: Look . Why the hell did you ing this up . It neve occured to me to take her out .
MRS. ROBINSON: Then give me your word you wo n't .
BEN: This is absurd .
MRS. ROBINSON: Promise me , Benjamin .
BEN: All right , for christ 's sake . I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson .
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you . Benjamin -
BEN: Let 's not talk about it . Let 's not talk at all .
MR. BRADDOCK: Elaine 's back from school . I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Do n't you think that she 's a terribly attractive girl ? Because I think she 's one of the prettiest girls I 've ever seen . Ben gives a small whimper .
BEN: Next time he suggests it , I 'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life .
MR. BRADDOCK: I guess she 's not good enough for you , is that it ?
BEN: Look - Elaine Robinson and I do not get along .
MR. BRADDOCK: How do you know ? You have n't seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whateve you do with them , are just too valuable .
BEN: That has nothing to do with it -
MR. BRADDOCK: I guess I 'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you 're just too busy every evening - doing God knows what -
MRS. BRADDOCK: Do n't go on like this . Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out -
BEN: I do .
MRS. BRADDOCK: - then I 'll simply invite all the Robinsons ' over for dinner on Thursday .
BEN: I 'll go call Elaine now .
MR. ROBINSON: Well , Braddock - it 's about time you got around to this . Come on in . I 'm afraid the young lady is n't quite ready yet -
BEN: Hello .
MR. ROBINSON: What would you say to a short one ? Bourbon still your drink ?
BEN: Yes . Mr. Robinson hands him drink .
MR. ROBINSON: I 'll see if she 's ready . Mr. Robinson exits .
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin I thought I made ELAINE 'S VOICE
ELAINE: Hello .
BEN: Hello .
ELAINE: You 're living at home now . Is that right ?
BEN: Yes .
ELAINE: Do you know what you 're going to do ?
BEN: No .

WAITER #2: Dinner for two , sir ?
BEN: No . Just for her . The waiter moves away .
ELAINE: Are n't you eating ?
BEN: No .

ELAINE: Where is the car ?
BEN: I just want to tell you something .
ELAINE: I want to go home .
BEN: But could I just tell you this one thing ?
ELAINE: What ?
BEN: This whole idea - this date and everything . It was my parents ' idea . They forced me into it .
ELAINE: Oh - that 's very nice of you to tell me .
BEN: No . What I mean is - that 's why I 've been acting this way . I 'm not like this . I hate myself like this .
ELAINE: No , I could n't .
BEN: But could you try ?
ELAINE: No .
BEN: Elaine - He starts to pull her head back .
ELAINE: Not here . Not here .
BEN: I 've had this feeling - eve since I 've graduated - this - kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time . Do you know what I mean ?
ELAINE: Yes , I do . He looks at her .
BEN: It 's like I 've been playing some kind of - game - but the ules do n't make any sense to me - She is watching him carefully .
ELAINE: Well - maybe I 'd better go in .
BEN: No , I mean - I would n't want to wake anyone up .
ELAINE: We wo n't . Let 's go inside .
BEN: Wait a minute .
ELAINE: Is anything wrong ?
BEN: No - I was just thinking - look - it 's still early - we could do something - go somewhere else .
ELAINE: All right .
BEN: I 'm trying to think of where there 's a place to have a drink around here .
ELAINE: Is n't there one in the Taft Hotel ?
BEN: Nothing . I 'm just wondering if they have a bar or not . I mean let 's go see . Let 's go see if they do or not .
ELAINE: Of course there is . Look - The Veranda Room - right there .
CAR PARKER: Good evening .
BELLBOY: Hello , how are you , sir ? The room clerk smiles at them .
ROOM CLERK: Good evening , Mr. Gladstone .

BEN: Come on , Elaine . We 're leaving .
ELAINE: Ben - what 's happening ? Who is Mr. Gladstone ?
BEN: I do n't know . They must think I look like this guy Gladstone .
ELAINE: Yes .
BEN: You 're the first - you 're the first thing for so long that I 've liked . The first person I could stand to be with . She takes his hand .
ELAINE: Benjamin - are having an affair with someone ? He freezes with his hand still on the key .
BEN: It just happened . It was just this thing that happened along with everything else . Can you understand that ? She nods .
ELAINE: Was she married or something ?
BEN: Yes .
ELAINE: With a family ?
BEN: Yes . She had a husband and a son .
ELAINE: Did they ever find out ?
BEN: No .
ELAINE: And it 's all over now .
BEN: Yes .
ELAINE: I 'm glad . He starts the car and drives out .
BEN: Can we do something tomorrow ?
ELAINE: All right .
BEN: During the day ? We 'll go fo a drive or something .
ELAINE: Okay .

ELAINE: Yes .
BEN: Because I would n't want you to do it unless you really wanted to !

BEN: You do ?
ELAINE: Benjamin - I really do .
MRS. ROBINSON: Drive down the block .
BEN: Mrs. Robinson - I have a date with Elaine . We 're going fo a drive .
MRS. ROBINSON: Do exactly what I say . Ben starts the car forward down the driveway .
BEN: Now it seems to me -
MRS. ROBINSON: Listen to me very carefully , Benjamin . You are not to see Elaine again . Ever . Those are my orders . Is that clear ?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson -
MRS. ROBINSON: I can makes things quite unpleasant .
BEN: How ?
MRS. ROBINSON: In order to keep Elaine away from you - I am prepared to tell her everything .
BEN: I do n't believe you .
MRS. ROBINSON: Then you 'd better start believing me .
BEN: Mrs. Robinson , do n't wreck it . I 'm asking you please not to wreck it .
MRS. ROBINSON: Go home now .
BEN: I just do n't believe you would do that . Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment .
MRS. ROBINSON: Try me .
BEN: Elaine !
ELAINE'S VOICE: Benjamin ?
BEN: I 'm coming up .
ELAINE'S VOICE: I 'm not dressed yet .
ELAINE: Benjamin - I said I was n't dressed - Ben pushes her back into her room .
BEN: You 've got to go over the back fence and I 'll meet you on the corner .
ELAINE: Benjamin - what 's happening ?
BEN: Hurry up . Put your shoes on . Ben turns and looks .
ELAINE: Because I want to know what 's happening .
BEN: There is n't time !
ELAINE: What is it ?
BEN: That woman -
ELAINE: What ?
BEN: That woman . The older woman .
ELAINE: You mean the one who -

ELAINE: What are you telling me ? The FOOTSTEPS stop .
BEN: Elaine -
ELAINE: Oh my God -
BEN: Please .
ELAINE: GET OUT !
BEN: Do n't cry .
ELAINE: Get out of here .
MRS. ROBINSON: Goodbye , Benjamin .
MR. BRADDOCK: Say that again .
BEN: I 'm going to marry Elaine Robinson .
MR. BRADDOCK: Well - well - well -
MRS. BRADDOCK: What 's happening ?
MR. BRADDOCK: Ben says he and Elaine are getting married .
MRS. BRADDOCK: I do n't believe it .
MR. BRADDOCK: That what he says . Right ?
BEN: I 'm going up to Berkeley today .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Oh , Ben - this is so - exciting -
MR. BRADDOCK: Come on , let 's call the Robinsons . We 've got something to celebrate .
BEN: No . I think you 'll want to wait on that .
MRS. BRADDOCK: They do n't know ?
BEN: No - they do n't .
MRS. BRADDOCK: Well - when did you decide all this ?
BEN: About an hour ago .
MR. BRADDOCK: Wait a minute . You talked to Elaine this morning ?
BEN: No . She does n't know about it .
MR. BRADDOCK: She does n't know that you 're coming up to Berkeley ?
BEN: No . Actually - she does n't know about us getting married yet .
MRS. BRADDOCK: When did you two talk this over ?
BEN: We have n't .
MR. BRADDOCK: Ben - this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked .
BEN: No - it 's not . It 's completely aked . It 's a decision I 've made .
MRS. BRADDOCK: But what makes you think she wants to marry you ?
BEN: She does n't . To be perfectly honest , she does n't like me .
BEN'S VOICE: Dear Elaine - I am now visiting Berkeley , after growing somewhat weary of family life . I have been meaning to stop by and pay my espects but am not entirely certain just how you feel about seeing me after the incident involving myself and your mother . It was certainly a serious mistake on my part but not serious enough . I hope
ELAINE'S VOICE: Hi - Sweetheart .
BEN'S VOICE: Where are the kids ?
ELAINE'S VOICE: Oh , they 're having a wonderful time - spending the day at Mother 's - she 's teaching them to It runs down .
BEN'S VOICE: Dear Mom and Dad . You may have wondered why Elaine and I have n't written in such a long time , but the postal sytem here in Greenland is n't the most efficient . Life among these wonderful natives It runs down .
MAN'S VOICE: Do you , Benjamin Braddock take this woman , Mrs. Robinson , fo your Mother-in-law , to love , cherish and It runs down .
BEN'S VOICE: Yes - how long ago that all seems .
BEN: Elaine Robinson .
BEN: Elaine . Hey - what a surprise . Say - I thought I remembered that you were going to school up here - well - we 'll have to get togethe sometime - I 'll be up here myself for a little while .

BEN: Ah . Where ? She does n't answer .
ELAINE: At the Zoo .
BEN: The Zoo . They have a pretty good one here , do they ?
ELAINE: I 've never been to it .

ELAINE: This is Benjamin Braddock . Carl Smith . Benjamin rode here with me on the bus .
CARL: Glad to meet you , Ben . Ben steps forward and grasps Carl 's hand .
BEN: Great meeting you , Carl .
ELAINE: I want to ask you a question .
BEN: Come in .
ELAINE: No . I want to know why you 're here in Berkeley ?
BEN: Because - I am .

BEN: What do you think ?
ELAINE: I think it is . Ben nods .
BEN: All right then ! Yes !
ELAINE: Well , I want you to leave .
BEN: Elaine - I love you .
ELAINE: How could you do that , Benjamin ?
BEN: What ?
ELAINE: I do n't understand -
BEN: Did you say rape her ?
ELAINE: - how you - how anyone - could do a thing like that .
BEN: What did she say ?
ELAINE: Let me go .
BEN: You 've got to tell me what she said . He touches her hair .
ELAINE: Why ?
BEN: Because it is n't true .
ELAINE: I do n't feel well .
BEN: Tell me .
ELAINE: She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend . You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room fo the night .
BEN: Then what ?
ELAINE: Then you took her upstairs and you raped her .
BEN: Elaine - that is not what happened . She puts her hands on his shoulder .
ELAINE: Please let me go .
BEN: All right - but listen to me . What happened was there was this party at my parents . I drove your mother home - then we went upstairs to see you portrait - Elaine tightens her arms around his neck .
ELAINE: Do n't tell me -
BEN: - and when we got up in the oom she starts taking her he clothes off - and -
ELAINE: Benjamin - this is my mother !
BEN: - suddenly there she was without any clothes on - I mean really naked -
A BOY: Shall I get the cops ?
BEN: What ?
A BOY: I 'll get the cops . He starts for the stairs .
BEN: Hey - wait a minute . Now damn it - look .
ELAINE: I 'm sorry I screamed . Ben opens the suitcase .
BEN: Elaine - right now I do n't feel like talking much . I 'm sorry about everything but I think I 'll just do this now . He stands , looking into the empty suitcase .
ELAINE: Can I just sit here while you 're packing ?
BEN: If you want .
ELAINE: What are you looking for ?
BEN: My belt .
ELAINE: Do n't you have it on ?
BEN: No . I have two . The other one is the one I 'm looking for . What 's this ? It 's from my grandmother .
ELAINE: The marble ?
BEN: The belt I 'm looking for was from my grandmother .
ELAINE: Oh .
BEN: I do n't know .
ELAINE: Are you going home ?
BEN: No .
ELAINE: Well - where are you going ?
BEN: Elaine - you 're going to have to stop asking me that .
ELAINE: I do n't want you to leave tomorrow .
BEN: I do n't understand .
ELAINE: I do n't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan .
BEN: But Elaine -
ELAINE: Goodbye .
BEN: What 's happening ? He gets out of the bed .
ELAINE: Benjamin ?
BEN: What ?
ELAINE: Will you kiss me ! He goes to her and they kiss .
BEN: Will you marry me ? She shakes her head .
ELAINE: I do n't know .
BEN: But you might .
ELAINE: I might .
BEN: Is that so ? You might marry me ?
ELAINE: Yes .
BEN: When ?
ELAINE: I do n't know .
BEN: How about tomorrow ? I do n't mean to be pushy but -
ELAINE: I do n't know . I do n't know what 's happening .
BEN: You mean you 're confused ? She nods .
ELAINE: I do n't see how we can .
BEN: We just can .
ELAINE: I have to go back now . She goes to the door .
BEN: Elaine - are you serious about this ?
ELAINE: I 'll think about it .
BEN: You really will ?
ELAINE: Yes .
BEN: Well - let 's get together sometime . He closes the door .
BEN: We could go down and get ou lood tests tomorrow .
ELAINE: Tomorrow ?
BEN: Or this afternoon . It 's a good day for it .
ELAINE: Benjamin - I have n't even said I 'll marry you yet .
BEN: We 'll need our Birth Certificates . I happen to have mine with me . Where 's yours ?
ELAINE: I just do n't think it would work .
BEN: Why would n't it ?
ELAINE: I just do n't think it would
BEN: Tomorrow then - can we get ou lood tests tomorrow morning ? She turns and looks at him .
ELAINE: Why do n't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much ?
BEN: Why do n't I just drag you off ? All right - I will . Right after we get the blood tests .
ELAINE: Well - I have to see Carl first .
BEN: Carl who ? Elaine jumps up , applauding a shot .
ELAINE: Carl Smith . He 's a medical student . We 've known him for years .
BEN: Who - that guy at the Zoo ?
ELAINE: Yes .
BEN: Why do you have to see him ?
ELAINE: Well I said I might marry him .
BEN: You WHAT ?
ELAINE: No , Benjamin .
BEN: Well , what did he say ? I 'm curious .
BEN: Oh no . He said that .
ELAINE: Shhhh .
BEN: Where did he do it ? She starts to get up .
ELAINE: No .
BEN: The day after tomorrow ?
ELAINE: Maybe we are and maybe we are n't .
MR. ROBINSON: Do you want - do you want to try and tell me why you did it ?
BEN: Mr. Robinson ?
MR. ROBINSON: Do you have a special grudge against me ? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me ?
BEN: No , it 's not
MR. ROBINSON: Is there something I 've said that 's caused this contempt ? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise ?
BEN: It was nothing to do with you , sir .
MR. ROBINSON: Well , Ben , it was quite a bit to do with me . Ben takes a step forward .
BEN: Now look - please -
MR. ROBINSON: Ben , I think we 're two civilized human beings . Do you think it 's necessary to threaten each other ?
BEN: I am not threatening you .
MR. ROBINSON: Do you want to unclench your fists , please ? Thank you . I can see in the dark , you know . I 've been here quite a while .
BEN: I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you , Mr. Robinson . I am trying to tell you I do not resent you .
MR. ROBINSON: You do n't respect me terribly much either , do you ?
BEN: No , I do n't .
MR. ROBINSON: Well , I do n't think we have a whole lot to say to each other , Ben . I do think you should know the consequences of what you 've done . I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon .
BEN: But why ?
MR. ROBINSON: Why ?
BEN: It should n't make any difference what happened .
MR. ROBINSON: That 's quite a statement .
BEN: Listen to me . We got - we got into bed with each other . But it was nothing . It was nothing at all . We might - we might just as well have been shaking hands .
MR. ROBINSON: Shaking hands . Well , that 's not saying much for my wife , is it ?
BEN: You miss the point .
MR. ROBINSON: Do n't shout at me , Ben .
BEN: The point is - I do n't love you wife . I love your daughter , sir .
MR. ROBINSON: Well - I 'm sure you think you do , Ben , but after a few times in ed with Elaine I feel quite sure you 'd get over that as quickly as you -
BEN: HUH ?
MR. ROBINSON: I think I 've talked about this enough . I do n't know how fa I can go , Ben . I do n't know if I can prosecute or not , but I think maybe I can . In the light of what 's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again . I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure
BEN: Mr. McCleery - do you have some change ? I need to use the phone ? MR. McCLEERY I want you out of here .
ELAINE'S VOICE: Dear Benjamin - I promise you some- say I will write a long letter about everything but right now I ca n't thank and all I can say to you is please forgive me because I know what I 'm doing is the best thing for you . My father is so upset you 've got to understand . I love you , but it would never work out .
BEN: Elaine - Elaine -
MRS. ROBINSON: Hello , Benjamin .
BEN: Where is she ?
MRS. ROBINSON: Hello . Get me the police , please .
BEN: Where is Elaine ?
MRS. ROBINSON: I 'll be with you in a moment , Benjamin . Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road . We have a urgler here . Just a second . I 'll ask him . Are you armed ? No - I do n't believe he is . Thank you . She hangs up .
BEN: What have you done to her ?
MRS. ROBINSON: I think we have everything quite under control now , Benjamin . Would you like a quick drink before you go ?
BEN: You ca n't stop me from seeing her , Mrs. Robinson . I 'll find her .
MRS. ROBINSON: I 'm sorry we wo n't be able to invite you to the wedding , Benjamin , but the arrangements have been so rushed -
BEN: What the hell have you done ? SOUND of SEVERAL CARS TURNING INTO DRIVEWAY .
MRS. ROBINSON: Ahh . I do n't think you 'll have time for that drink after all .
BEN: I 'll find her .
MRS. ROBINSON: I do n't think so .
BEN: Wedding ! God Damn it - wedding !
CARL'S VOICE: Your father 's right , Elaine . You and I will make a darned good team .
WOMAN'S VOICE: We have two Carl Smiths . Is it Carl with a `` C '' or a `` K '' ?
BEN'S VOICE: I 'm afraid I do n't know .
WOMAN'S VOICE: The Karl Smith with a `` K '' teaches History of Advertising -
BEN'S VOICE: And the other ?
WOMAN'S VOICE: The one with the `` C '' , Carl Smith Junior , is in our medical school . He lives at Gamma Delta Tau .
BEN: Say - fellows - They stop eating and turn toward him .
CARTER'S VOICE: Santa Barbara .
BEN: You do n't happen to know exactly where the Make Out King is getting married , do you ? I 'm supposed to be there .
CARTER'S VOICE: I do n't know . Maybe at his old man 's home .
BEN: Yes .
WOMAN'S VOICE: 657-2036
BEN: Hello - who is this ?
WOMAN'S VOICE: This is Dr. Smith 's answering service .
BEN: Is the doctor anywhere ?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Well - you see - the doctor is at his son 's wedding , but I 'm sure it 's ove y now . He should be checking in any moment -
BEN: Listen to me . I am Dr. Smith 's other - Reverend Smith - and I am supposed to perform the ceremony . I just got in - from - Portland - and I 've forgotten what church - you see ?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Oh . Well - I 'm not sure - but you might try the First Presbyterian . That 's on Allan Street .
BEN: Thank you .
WOMAN'S VOICE: I certainly hope you -
BEN: Allan Street . Where is it ?
ATTENDANT: Six blocks up - three blocks over .
BEN: I 'm not a priest - I 'm a minister . The car drives out of the station .
CARL: Who is that guy ? What 's he doing ?
MR. ROBINSON: I 'll take care of him .
MRS. ROBINSON: He 's too late .
ELAINE: Ben !
BEN: Come on - do n't faint .
MRS. ROBINSON: Elaine - it 's too late . Elaine pulls her hand away .
ELAINE: Not for me .
BEN: MOVE !
DRIVER: Where do you want to go ?
BEN: To the end .
ELAINE: Benjamin ?
BEN: What ? She takes his hand .
OLDER MAN: I 'm real sorry about Dorothy , Walt . She was a real peach .
WALT: Thanks for coming , Al .
MITCH: Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley . He ca n't even tone it down at Mom 's funeral ?
STEVE: What do you expect ? Dad 's still living in the ‘ 50s . He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly .
MITCH: Yeah , well your kid 's wearing a Timberwolves jersey . I 'm sure Dad appreciates that .
STEVE: My point is that there 's nothing anyone can do that wo n't disappoint the Old Man .
PAGE 3: It 's inevitable . That 's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings ; the deal with the boat motor , the oken bird bath , it 's always something .
MITCH: What are we going to do with him ? Do n't you think he 'll get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood ?
STEVE: Why do n't you have him move in with you ?
MITCH: Ha ha .
FATHER JANOVICH: Death is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics . Bitte in the pain it causes the deceased and their families . Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them . And some may ask , what is death . Is it the end ? O is it the beginning ? And what is life ? What is this thing we call life ?
WALT: Jesus .
STEVE: A lot of people showed up afte the service .
WALT: Yeah , well , I s'pose they knew there 'd be plenty of ham . I think I 'll go downstairs and get some more chairs .
STEVE: I 'll do it , Dad .
WALT: Naw , we need them now , not next week .
DAVID: Is that Dad ?
DANIEL: No , it 's Grandpa Walt . Josh turns the photo over and reads it
JOSH: ‘ Third Platoon , E company , March second , 1952 , Korea . '
DANIEL: Where 's Korea ?
JOSH: Hell if I know ? David holds up a MEDAL .
DAVID: Cool , I found a medal .
MITCH: Ashley , honey . Why do n't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs ?
ASHLEY: Me ?
KAREN: Yes you .
ASHLEY: Grandpa Walt , can I help you with the chairs .
WALT: I 'll take care of it , you just painted your nails .
WALT: Jesus Christ , how many swamp rats can they cram into a living room ?
ASHLEY: Wow , Grandpa , when 'd you get the vintage car ?
ASHLEY: I never knew you had a cool old car .
WALT: It 's only been in here since efore you were born .
ASHLEY: So , what are you like going to do with it like , when you die ? Walt lights up a smoke
WALT: Jesus , Joseph and Mary .
ASHLEY: Then what about that super cool etro couch in the den , I 'm going to State next year and I do n't have , like , any furniture ? Walt walks out without commenting .
WALT: Who the hell are you ?
TAO: I 'm Tao , I live next door .
WALT: What ? ! Speak up , boy , get the shit out of your mouth . What do you want ?
TAO: Do you have jumper cables ? My uncle 's car is old and
WALT: No . And have some goddamned espect , zipper head , we 're mourning over here . Walt slams the door in Tao 's face .
FATHER JANOVICH: How you holding up , Walt ?
WALT: Mr. Kowalski .
FATHER JANOVICH: Huh ?
WALT: It 's Mr. Kowalski , not Walt .
FATHER JANOVICH: Right , Mr. Kowalski . Your wife and I became quite close these last few months . She asked that I watch over you when she passed on . I told her I watch out for my entire flock , but she made me promise I 'd keep an extra sharp eye on you .
WALT: I appreciate your kindness to my wife and now that you 've spoken your piece , why do n't you move on to the next sheep ?
FATHER JANOVICH: Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession . She said she could n't remember the last time you went .
WALT: Is that so ?
FATHER JANOVICH: It is . Walt drains his lowball glass .
WALT: Well , I confess I never much liked church and only went because of the wife . And I confess I have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary .
MITCH: I 'd really like to help , Dad , but we have to get the kids home , they 're getting restless .
WALT: Fine . Go .
MITCH: I 'll call in a few , see how you 're doing .
WALT: Kill you to buy American .
MITCH: Did you see him look at the truck ? It 's always Rice-Burner this o Jap-Buggy that . Even at Mom 's funeral , he ca n't let it go .
KAREN: At least he did n't say anything this time .
MITCH: He did n't have to .
KAREN: Well , what do you expect ? The man worked at a Ford plant for twenty- eight years .
MITCH: And I suppose that 's my goddamned fault ?
WALT: Barbarians . Goddamned barbarians .
SUBTITLED: There 's no man in this house , that 's why my daughter should emarry . Being a second wife is etter than having a woman be the head of the household . It 's not our way .
SUBTITLED: What about Tao ?
SUBTITLED: What about him ?
SUBTITLED: He 's the man in the house .
SUBTITLED: Tao 's not a man .
GESTURES: Look at him in the kitchen , washing dishes like a woman . Even his sister gives him orders and he obeys .
WALT: I thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers . Christ , I had my own car when I was his age .
HEAD LATINO: Whatta you gon na do , gook ? You gon na ‘ Kung Fu ' us ?
LATINO #2: Surprised it ai n't a girl 's bike . The Latinos laugh . Tao remains on the ground .
HEAD LATINO: You gon na get up or what ? Tao does n't move .
WALT: Damn chinks let their yards go to hell . Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn . Tao walks past . Walt watches him pass .
SUBTITLED: Why does n't that stupid , hairy white man move ? He must be too dumb to realize he 's not welcome here . All the Mee-Khah left in the neighborhood should just move away . Look at him strut like a ooster .
WALT: Jesus Christ , dog , have you gone totally deaf ?
FATHER JANOVICH: Hi there , Walt .
WALT: Listen , son , you 're not my barber , you 're not a friend , so why in the hell do you think you can call me Walt ?
FATHER JANOVICH: Sorry Mr. Kowalski .
WALT: So , what are you peddling now ?
FATHER JANOVICH: Oh , nothing . Thought I 'd drop by and see how you were doing . Have n't seen you in church in awhile .
WALT: Okay . You 've done your good deed , now why do n't you run along .
FATHER JANOVICH: I 'd really like to talk , Mr. Kowalski .
WALT: I do n't think so , kid . Sorry .
FATHER JANOVICH: Why ? Do you have a problem with me , Mr. Kowalski ?
WALT: You do n't want to know .
FATHER JANOVICH: No , I do .
WALT: The problem is I think you 're an overeducated , 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity .
LATINO DRIVER: Is you a boy or a girl , I ca n't tell ?
LATINO #2: What you reading , gook , Jackass And The Rice Stalk ? Tao laughs , but keeps walking .
LATINO DRIVER: That 's right , you keep walking . Fucking slopes everywhere you look , man . Why gooks come up in here and fuck up our neighborhood ?
SPIDER: Dude , that 's my little cousin , Tao .
SMOKIE: You sure about that , Spider ?
SPIDER: I 'm sure . Do we do something or what ?
SMOKIE: Your cousin tight with anyone ?
SPIDER: No , he flies solo , Smokie .
SMOKIE: Okay . Let 's go help out ou little cousin .
LATINO DRIVER: Oh goody , more Rice Niggers .
LATINO #2: Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats . Go ack to your fucking rice paddy .
SMOKIE: Where the fuck does he think he 's going ? Turn us around and go after that cousin of yours .
SPIDER: Hey , cuz , slow down , where you going ? You should really think about hanging with us , man . If we all stick together , shit like that wo n't happen , with those Spicks . Tao nods as he walks , but does n't answer .
SMOKIE: You think about it and we 'll see you tomorrow .
SPIDER: Hey , cuz . Hey , Sue .
SUE: What do you want ?
SPIDER: Came to talk to my cousin Tao . Smokie looks over to Sue .
SMOKIE: Spider , who 's the other cousin ?
SUE: ‘ Spider ' ? Is that what he just called you , Fong ?
SPIDER: This is my little cousin , Sue .
SMOKIE: Hey , Sue how old are you , girl ?
SUE: Mentally , I 'm way too old for you . I 'm going inside .
SPIDER: That 's right , go inside while the men talk .
SUE: Yeah , that 's exactly what I 'm doing , Fong .
SPIDER: You think about what we talked about ?
SMOKIE: That 's exactly the point , Tao . Spider told me how everyone thinks you 're a pushover , how everybody walks all over you and shit . I mean , look at you , out here working in the garden like a woman .
SPIDER: Smokie 's right . We 're family , ight ? You with us or what ?
SMOKIE: I swear , brother , we 're the best friends you 'll ever have . And anyone fucks with you , they 're fucked .
SPIDER: Come on , man .
TAO: What do I have to do ? Smokie points to Walt 's open garage .
SMOKIE: Spider mentioned that neighbor of yours .
WALT: I got one . A Mexican , a Jew and a colored guy walk into a bar , the artender looks up at them and says ‘ get the fuck out . '
FATHER JANOVICH: So , here 's where my flock congregates when they 're not in church .
MEL: Hiya , Father J .
FATHER JANOVICH: Hi , Mel . Hey there , Darrel .
DARREL: Hello , Father .
FATHER JANOVICH: Hi , Walt . Walt says nothing . He just sips his beer .
DARREL: What brings you in here , Father ? The meat raffle ?
FATHER JANOVICH: No . I came down to talk to Walt , if that 's okay .
WALT: I have to hand it to you , Padre . You are persistent .
FATHER JANOVICH: I promised your wife .
WALT: Oh Jesus Christ , let 's grab a ooth .
FATHER JANOVICH: I 'll have a Diet Coke .
WALT: Bullshit , this is a bar , what do you want to drink ?
FATHER JANOVICH: Ummmm I 'll have a gin and tonic .
WALT: Attaboy . The waitress leaves .
FATHER JANOVICH: I promised your wife I 'd get you to go to confession .
WALT: Jesus Christ , why 'd you do that ?
FATHER JANOVICH: She was very insistent . She made me .
WALT: You sure are fond of promising people stuff you ca n't deliver on .
FATHER JANOVICH: Let 's talk about something else .
WALT: Like what ?
FATHER JANOVICH: Life and death .
WALT: What would you know about it ?
FATHER JANOVICH: I 'd like to think I know a lot . I 'm a priest .
WALT: You stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything othe than what you learned in priest school . Everything you say sounds like it 's out of the Rookie Preachers Handbook .
FATHER JANOVICH: I do n't know about that
PAGE 22: Walt waves his hand and cuts him off .
WALT: ‘ Death is bittersweet ? Bitter in the pain , sweet in the salvation . ' That 's what you know of life and death ? Good God , it 's pathetic .
FATHER JANOVICH: What do you know , Mr. Kowalski ?
WALT: Plenty . I lived with death fo three years in Korea . We shot people , we stabbed them with ayonets , we hacked seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels , for Christ 's sake . I did things that wo n't leave me till the day I die , horrible things , things I have to live with .
FATHER JANOVICH: And what about life ?
WALT: Well I survived the war got married and raised a family .
FATHER JANOVICH: Sounds like you know more about death than you do living . Walt downs a shot .
WALT: Maybe so .
WALT: Son of a bitch .
SPIDER: Get in , get in !
SMOKIE: Get in , Tao .
TAO: No way . No fucking way . Leave me alone !
SPIDER: I vouched for you , Tao , because you 're family and you 're with us now . Tao struggles .
TAO: He shot at me ! I 'm out ! I 'm out ! ! !
SMOKIE: Do n't fool yourself , Tao . You do n't join us and bail . Dum motherfucker .
SPIDER: Should we go after him ?
SMOKIE: Naw , he 's got nowhere to go . Let 's get out of here .
WALT: Hello ?
MITCH: Right , good afternoon , then .
WALT: So , what do you want ?
MITCH: Me ? Nothing . What would I want ?
WALT: I do n't know . Your wife already went through all of your mother 's jewelry .
MITCH: No . I was just wondering how you are , what 's going on , anything new in the old neighborhood ?
WALT: Nope .
MITCH: Great . Smooth sailing then ?
WALT: Yup .
MITCH: Well good Say , Dad ?
WALT: Uh-huh .
MITCH: Do you still know that guy from the plant who has Viking season tickets ?
MUTTERS: That 's right , ai n't she pretty .
SPIDER: Hey , cuz . What 's up ?
TAO: What are you doing here ?
SPIDER: Be happy . We 've got good news .
SUE: Oh really ? What 's that ?
SMOKIE: We 're giving you another shot .
TAO: I do n't think so .
SMOKIE: You blew it the first time . We 've got another little inauguration planned for you . This time there 'll be no mistakes .
SUE: Another big , tough gangbanger with ‘ little-man ' complex .
SMOKIE: I got my eye on you too , little girl .
SUE: Whatever .
SMOKIE: Come on , Tao . Let 's go . Tao says nothing . He looks at the ground .
SPIDER: He said , let 's go .
SMOKIE: Come on , man . Nobody 's gon na get hurt . We 'll take care of you .
SUE: Do n't go , Tao .
SMOKIE: You mind your own business , girl . Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms .
SUBTITLED: Leave my grandson alone !
PAGE 28: I know what you are . Go away and do n't come back .
SMOKIE: That old woman 's got bigger balls than you . You always let little girls and old ladies fight fo you ?
SUE: Run , Tao , run ! Sue is slapped to the ground .
WALT: Get off my lawn .
SMOKIE: Listen , old man , you do n't want
WALT: I said get off my lawn . Now .
SMOKIE: Are you fucking crazy ? Go back in your house , old man .
WALT: Get off my lawn .
SMOKIE: I 'm not fucking around , Gramps .
WALT: Do n't think for a second I wo n't low a big hole in your face and it wo n't bother me a bit , not any more than if I shot a deer . Now get off my goddamned lawn .
SMOKIE: I 'm not gon na warn you again ! Walt laughs
WALT: You 're nothing to me . In Korea , we stacked fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags .
SMOKIE: You better watch yourself , old man .
SUE: Thank you .
WALT: I said get off my lawn .
WALT: No . No more .
SUE: We brought you some shallots to plant in your garden .
WALT: I do n't want them .
SUE: They 're perennials , they come back every year .
WALT: No . You keep them . Why do you people keep giving me all this garbage ? Sue is a little taken aback .
SUE: Because because you saved Tao .
WALT: No , I did n't . All I did was get a unch of jabbering gooks off my lawn .
SUE: Well , you 're a hero to the neighborhood .
WALT: No , I 'm not .
SUE: Too bad , they think you are and that 's why they 're bringing you the gifts .
WALT: Just take your plant and leave me alone . Walt turns and starts to walk away .
SUE: There 's another thing .
WALT: What ?
SUE: This is my mother , Vu , I 'm Sue and this is my brother , Tao . We live next door .
WALT: So ?
SUE: Tao is here to apologize .
TAO: I 'm sorry .
WALT: For what ?
TAO: For trying to steal your car .
WALT: Get this straight , I see you on my property again , you 're done .
FATHER JANOVICH: Good afternoon , Walt . Walt 's eyes narrow .
WALT: I already told you I 'm not going to confession .
FATHER JANOVICH: Why did n't you just call the police ?
WALT: Pardon ?
FATHER JANOVICH: I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood . Why did n't you call the police ?
WALT: Oh , I prayed for them to show up , ut guess what ? No answer .
FATHER JANOVICH: What were you thinking ? Someone could have been killed . We 're talking life and death here .
WALT: Not that it 's any of you goddamned business , but when things happen quickly like that , you have to react . In Korea , we never ‘ called the police ' when a swarm of screaming gooks came pouring into our lines . We eacted .
FATHER JANOVICH: We 're not in Korea , Mr. Kowalski . Walt says nothing .
WALT: I 'm impressed . You came with you guns loaded , for once .
FATHER JANOVICH: Thank you .
WALT: You have balls , Father . And what you said , you 're right . I 'm sure stronger men than me have found their salvation . Hallelujah . But there 's one thing you 're way wrong about .
FATHER JANOVICH: What 's that , Mr. Kowalski ?
WALT: The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he was n't ordered to do .
BARBER: There , you look like a human being again . You should n't wait so long etween haircuts , you cheap astard .
WALT: I 'm just amazed that you 're still alive . I keep hoping you 'll die and they 'll get someone good in here , but you just hang in there , you dumb , Italian-Wop-Dago , you .
BARBER: That 'll be ten dollars , Walt .
WALT: Ten dollars ? Jesus Christ , Martin , you keep raising the price . You sure you 're not part Jew ? Martin the Barber laughs at Walt .
BARBER: It 's been ten bucks for the last five years and you know it , you thick-skulled , old Pollack son of a bitch .
WALT: Here 's ten , keep the change .
BARBER: See you in three weeks , you prick .
WALT: If you live that long , dipshit .
TREY: Yo , it 's cool , dog .
TREY: Nothing . We 're going to Red Roost to get some CDs . That place is trippin ' , bro .
SUE: Great , another asshole with a fetish for Asian girls . God , it gets so old .
SUE: What , are you gon na hit me now ? That 'd pretty much complete the picture .
WALT: You and your buddies . What 's the matter with you ? Do n't any of you work ? I see you lazy show- offs in the middle of the day , slowly walking across the street or harassing women . Nobody owes you bastards anything so go out and get a job instead of pushing little girls around , for Christ 's sake .
WALT: Look at me , Slick . You 're crazy if you thinking I 'm fooling around .
TREY: Man , thanks a lot , mister .
WALT: Go home , clown and pull up you goddamned pants . Walt turns to Sue .
SUE: So , what 's with you , you have some sort of savior complex o something ?
WALT: What in the hell 's the matter with you ? I thought all you Asian girls were supposed to be so smart . What are you doing walking around in that neighborhood ? That 's how you end up in the obituaries , that is , if they can identify your body once they pull it out of the goddamned river .
SUE: I know , I know . Take it easy .
WALT: So , that goofball back there . He 's your boyfriend ?
SUE: Yeah , kind of , his name is Trey .
WALT: Why in the hell would you go out with a clown like that . Why do n't you date one of your ownone of those other Hu-mungs .
SUE: You mean , Hmong ? We 're Hmong , not Hu-mung .
WALT: Right . Hmong . What is a where is Hmong or whatever ? Sue laughs .
SUE: Wow ! You 're so enlightened . Hmong is n't a place , it 's a people .
PAGE 41: Hmong people come from different parts of Laos and Thailand and China .
WALT: Then why are you in my neighborhood , instead of back there ?
SUE: It 's a Vietnam thing . We fought on your side and when America quit , the Communists starting killing the Hmong , so we came ove here . Walt is quiet for few seconds .
WALT: Why 'd you pick the Midwest , fo Christ 's sake ? There 's snow on the ground near half the year . Jungle people on the frozen tundra ?
SUE: Hill people . We were hill people , not jungle people . Boo-ga , boo- ga , boo-ga .
WALT: Whatever .
SUE: Blame the Lutherans . They brought us here .
WALT: Still , you 'd think the cold would keep all the assholes away .
SUE: Thanks for the ride .
WALT: Sure You know , you seem okay . What the hell 's the matter with your half-wit brother ? He a little slow or something ?
SUE: Tao is actually really bright , he just does n't know which direction to go in .
WALT: Oh , poor Toad .
SUE: It 's really common . Hmong girls over here fit in better , we adjust . The girls go to college , the boys go to jail .
WALT: Old hag , giving me the evil eye ?
WALT: Christ all Friday . What 's wrong with kids today ?
MITCH: Go ahead , Dad . Open it .
WALT: What is it ?
MITCH: Just open it .
KAREN: Here 's one from me .
KAREN: It 's a phone .
EMOTIONLESSLY: Thank you , Karen .
KAREN: I just thought we thought that it would make things easier .
WALT: Yeah , I see that .
KAREN: There 's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself .
MITCH: Karen 's right , Dad . You 've worked hard your whole life . Maybe you should think about taking it a little easier ? Walt lights up a cigarette .
KAREN: There 's these great places now , these communities where you do n't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow . People who are like you , alert , active , ut are alone and would benefit by eing with other folks their own age .
MITCH: Dad , take a look . We brought some pamphlets .
KAREN: I know , you were right .
MITCH: Son of a bitch ! He just wo n't let anyone help him .
KAREN: Well , we tried . Now we can just drop it . No one can say we did n't try .
MITCH: To hell with him , kicking us out on his birthday ? ! We should 've stayed home with Ashley and Josh . They knew better , they would n't even come . The goddamned kids are smarter than we are !
WALT: We miss Momma , do n't we , Daisy .
SUE: Hey , Walt , what are you up to ?
WALT: What do you think ?
SUE: There 's tons of food .
WALT: I 'll bet . Just keep your paws off my dog .
SUE: No worries , we only eat cats .
WALT: Really ?
SUE: No , I 'm kidding , you moron . Come on , come on over . You can be my special guest .
WALT: I 'm fine right here .
SUE: What have you had to eat today , Walt ?
WALT: A piece of cake and some beef jerky .
SUE: Come on over and get something to eat . We 've got beer , too . Walt exhales loudly
WALT: Oh , what the hell . It 's my irthday , I may as well drink with strangers instead of myself .
SUE: Happy Birthday , Wally .
WALT: Do n't call me Wally .
SUE: As they say , When in Hmong .
WALT: Ha ha . Are you sure it 's okay I 'm here ? Everyone keeps looking at me and when I look back , they look at the ground .
SUE: It 's fine .
SUBTITLED: You , get out . Out of our house ! What is he doing here ? Walt cringes at her presence .
WALT: What 'd she say ?
SUE: She said welcome to our home .
WALT: No she did n't .
SUE: No , she did n't .
SUBTITLED: Why is this white man in our home ? A man like him brings nothing , nothing but sorrow and death .
WALT: She hates me .
SUE: Yes , she hates you .
WALT: What did I do ?
SUE: Maybe we should go in the othe oom .
SUE: A lot of the people in this house are very traditional . Number one , never touch a Hmong person on the head , not even a child . Hmong people believe that the soul esides in the head , so do n't do that .
WALT: That 's dumb , but fine .
SUE: Hmong people also consider looking someone in the eye to be rude . That 's why everyone looks away when you look at them .
WALT: Swell . Anything else ?
SUE: Yeah , some Hmong smile or grin when they 're yelled at or get into a confrontation . It 's a cultural thing . It expresses embarrassment or insecurity , not that they 're laughing at you .
WALT: Good God , you people are all nuts .
SUE: What ?
WALT: You said you guys do n't look you in the eye , but that guy keeps staring at me .
SUE: This is Kor Khue . He 's the Lo family shaman .
WALT: Witch doctor ? Sue smiles and nods .
SUE: Something like that . The Hmong hold their clan Shaman in very high regards .
WALT: Boo-ga , boo-ga .
SUE: Kor Khue is interested in you , he heard what you did . He says he would like to read you .
WALT: Huh ?
SUE: He wants to read you . Tell you your soul . It 'd be rude not to allow him this , it 's a great honor .
WALT: Tell Kor to be my guest , fire away .
SUE: Kor Khue says that you think you 've been disrespected . You do not live your life . Your food has no flavor . You are scared of you past .
PAGE 51: You stopped living years and years ago . Kor Khue says you 're not at peace .
WALT: Excuse me .
SUE: Are you okay ?
WALT: Son of a bitch . I 've got more in common with these goddamned gooks than my own spoiled-rotten family .
PAGE 52: Walt looks at himself .
WALT: Happy birthday .
SUE: Are you okay ?
WALT: Me ? I 'm fine .
SUE: You were bleeding ? Walt smiles disarmingly .
WALT: I just bit my tongue . I 'm fine . I 'm great . Let 's get some of that gook food , I 'm starving .
SUE: Come on , you glutton , let 's go downstairs .
WALT: Why ?
SUE: To mingle .
WALT: I 'm fine right here . I 'm mingling .
SUE: Come on , you said ‘ not to leave you alone . '
WALT: Oh great .
SUE: Well , look who 's over there .
WALT: What's-his-name who tried to steal my Gran Torino .
SUE: My brother Tao .
WALT: Yeah , Toad .
SUE: Rice liquor . Try it .
WALT: Alright .
WA XAM: Hi , Walt . I 'm Wa Xam .
WALT: Wa Yum ?
WA XAM: No , Wa Xam . So what do you do ?
WALT: Me ? Not too much I fix stuff I guess .
WA XAM: Like what ?
WALT: Well , I fixed my wife 's friend 's sink yesterday .
PAGE 55: I drove my aunt to the doctor to straighten out her prescription . Even fixed my screen door before it was broke .
WA XAM: You 're funny .
WALT: That 's one thing I 've never been accused of . A bastard , yes . Funny , no . Wa Xam laughs .
WA XAM: Well , have fun . I 'm going to take off .
WALT: A pleasure to meet you , Yum Yum .
TAO: It 's Tao .
WALT: What 's that ?
TAO: It 's Tao , not Toad . My name is Tao .
WALT: Good for you . Anyways , you 're lowing it with that girl . Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you .
TAO: You do n't know what you 're talking about .
WALT: Wrong , egg roll . I completely know what I 'm talking about . I know I 'm not always the most pleasant person to be around , but I got the greatest woman who eve lived to marry me . I had to work at it , but I got her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me . Hands down .
TAO: Who ?
WALT: She was standing over there , orange dress , twisting her hai and smiling at you .
TAO: You mean Wa Xam ?
WALT: Yeah , yeah . Anyways , she likes you , I know , I talked to her . Great girl , charming girl . Love her . I love Yum Yum . But you ? You just watch her walk out the door with the Three Stooges . Why ? Because you 're a big fat pussy ! Walt drains his drink .
WALT: I got ta go home . Good luck , puss- cake . You need it .
DEFEATED: Okay , just put them on the porch . But that 's it . No more .
WALT: What now , Gee ? Gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil .
WALT: I ca n't . You have to stop .
SUE: Tao is here to make amends , he 's here to work for you .
WALT: No he 's not .
SUE: Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt . He 'll start tomorrow morning .
WALT: No . The kid is useless , I do n't even want him on my property . I thought we already went over that .
SUE: It 's very important to my mothe that you accept . It 'd be an insult to refuse .
WALT: How is this all of a sudden turned around on me ? The goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow I 'm the bad guy if I do n't accept ?
SUE: My family is very traditional and it will very much upset them if you do n't let Tao repay Tao interrupts from the sidewalk
TAO: Come on , Sue . If he does n't want to , let 's just go .
WALT: Fine . Great . Tomorrow . Walt walks past them and into his house .
TAO: Like what ?
WALT: That 's what I 'm asking . What are you good at ?
PAGE 60: If you 're gon na work for me , I have to know what you can do .
TAO: I do n't know .
WALT: That 's about what I expected . Okay , why do n't you go over by the spruce tree and count how many irds feed at the bird feeder .
TAO: Count the birds ?
WALT: Yeah , you can count ? You slopes are supposed to be good at math , ight ?
TAO: Yes , I can count .
WALT: No .
TAO: Why not ?
WALT: I want it done right , that 's why .
TAO: But you 've got me just standing here . What am I supposed to be doing , anyway ?
WALT: Scaring away crows . Tao shoots Walt a dirty look .
WALT: It 's a perfect job for you , plus you people do n't seem to mind squinting in the sun all day .
TAO: What do you have for me today ? You want me to watch paint dry o maybe count the clouds that pass y ?
WALT: Do n't get flip with me , zippe head . I ai n't the one who tried to steal and do n't forget it .
TAO: Go ahead . I do n't care if you insult me and say racist things . I 'll take it .
WALT: That I know . You have no teeth , kid . That 's your problem . You have no balls .
TAO: Look , I 'm stuck here . Why do n't you give me something useful to do .
WALT: Because unlike you I 'm not useless . I maintain my property , whereas you swamp rats let you houses go to hell .
QUIETLY: Till next Friday . Walt laughs out loud . It makes Tao cringe .
WALT: Go get my ladder out of the garage .
GRANDSON: Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch ?
WALT: I do n't see why not .
GRINS: Tell him sometime after lunch .
WALT: Jesus Lord almighty , knock it off .
TAO: It 's my last day , whatta you want me to do ?
WALT: Take the day off , you 've done enough .
WALT: Toad .
ASIAN DOCTOR: Mr. Kowalski ?
WALT: That 's right .
ASIAN DOCTOR: Good afternoon . I looked ove your paperwork and I think we should immediately start on a full attery of tests . I feel that this
WALT: Wait a minute . Where 's my regula doctor , where 's Dr. Fellman ?
ASIAN DOCTOR: Dr. Fellman retired three years ago . I 'm his replacement , Dr. Chang .
WALT: Jesus Christ .
ASHLEY: It 's Grandpa Walt .
KAREN: Well , pick it up .
ASHLEY: You talk to him .
KAREN: Mitch ?
MITCH: I 'm doing bills here .
KAREN: He 's your father .
MITCH: Hello , Dad .
WALT: Um not much , how about you ?
MITCH: I 'm fine , fine .
WALT: Fine . That 's fine How about the kids and Karen ?
MITCH: Everyone is fine .
WALT: Good .
MITCH: Good .
WALT: Well , that 's good How 's work ?
MITCH: Busy .
WALT: Right . I s'pose .
MITCH: Speaking of busy , I have a lot on my plate right now , unless there 's something pressing .
WALT: No . Nope . Another pause .
MITCH: Okay . Yeah , so it 's not a good time right now . Why do n't you call me over the weekend .
WALT: Sure .
MITCH: Okay , it was nice talking to you , ye , Dad . Walt hangs up . He lies down on his bed .
WALT: Hey , moron .
TAO: What ?
WALT: I appreciate you 're doing something on your own , but you 're the only person I know dumb enough to get himself killed trimming tree branches .
TAO: What now ?
WALT: You do n't stand on the top step of a ladder and if you cut through that branch you 're hacking away at , you 'll end up kaput .
WALT: Make sure you put the ladder back when you 're done raking up the leaves .
TAO: I know . I will .
WALT: This kid does n't have a chance .
TAO: What do you know about faucets ?
WALT: For the love of Pete .
TAO: What ?
WALT: It must be a hundred degrees in here , turn on the fan .
TAO: Man , where did you get all this stuff ?
WALT: What are you talking about ?
TAO: All the tools and stuff .
WALT: Where the hell do you think I got them , Toad ? This may come as a shock to a thief , but I actually ought the things I have with money I earned .
TAO: Yeah , yeah , yeah , that 's not what I meant . There 's just so much shit packed in here .
WALT: You need the right tool for the ight job . Every single thing here has a purpose .
TAO: Okay , what 's this ? Tao points to a tool .
WALT: Post hole digger .
TAO: I ca n't afford to buy all this stuff .
WALT: I did n't buy all this stuff at once , blockhead . I 've lived here for fifty years . A man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools .
TAO: Yeah , but
WALT: Look , kid , I think I know where you 're going with this . You do n't need everything to maintain a house . I 'm going to let you in on a little secret .
TAO: Okay . Cool .
WALT: What 's with what ?
TAO: The blood you just coughed up . That 's not good , you should see a doctor .
WALT: So what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night ? Who are they ?
TAO: A gang . Hmong gangbangers .
WALT: I gathered that . What did they want with you ?
TAO: They wanted to take me away ecause I blew my first initiation .
WALT: You joined up with those pukes ? Damn , you are a pussy . Why in the hell did you do that ?
TAO: I do n't know . They were persuasive . My cousin 's in the gang . They just talked me into it I guess .
WALT: Well , at least you 're honest about it .
WALT: So how 'd you blow your first initiation ? Tao nods towards the GRAN TORINO .
KAREN: See you later , I 'm taking the kids to the mall . Mitch never looks up from the TV .
MITCH: Yeah , fine . Just do n't spend too much goddamned money .
KAREN: I will . We hear Karen and the kids exit .
MITCH: Thank God . Finally get the house to myself for once .
MITCH: Hello .
WALT: Well I um I 'm getting the old Westinghouse up out of the asement . Mitch mouths the word “ Shit . ”
MITCH: Uh-huh .
WALT: So I got it on the dolly .
MITCH: Yeah , that 'll help .
WALT: Yeah And it 's a bit heavy for one guy .
MITCH: Uh-huh .
WALT: Yeah I need a hand .
MITCH: Oh .
WALT: So are you busy ?
MITCH: Does it have to be done right this second ? It 's been down there fo years .
WALT: Well Yeah , I 'd like to get on it .
MITCH: Does it work ? We were thinking about getting a freezer . What are you going to do with it ?
WALT: Giving it to Aunt Mary .
MITCH: Oh Ca n't she give you a hand ?
WALT: She 's eighty-one .
MITCH: I know , I was joking What does she need it for ?
WALT: To freeze food . Mitch opens another beer .
MITCH: Yeah , well , I 'd love to help you out , Dad , but I 'm just walking out the door . I have to bring the kids to the mall . Sorry .
WALT: Uh-huh .
MITCH: Why do n't you call Stevie ?
WALT: Your brother lives out of state .
MITCH: Well , I do n't know what to tell you , I 'm on my way out . Keys in my hand .
WALT: Okay then .
MITCH: If you ca n't find anyone by next week , give me a call . Walt nods and hangs up . Mitch hangs up and takes a sip of beer .
MITCH: Aunt Mary . Like she needs a freezer .
WALT: You got a minute , Toad ?
TAO: Let me take the top .
WALT: Naw , I got it .
TAO: No really , I 'll take the top . It looks pretty heavy .
WALT: I 'm not crippled . I got it .
TAO: If you do n't let me take the top , I ai n't helping . I 'll go home .
WALT: Listen , zipper head , now 's not the time to go and
TAO: You listen , old man . You came and got me because you needed help , so let me help you . Either it 's top or I 'm out of here .
WALT: Okay then , be my guest . Just do n't let it slip out of you little girl hands and crush me . Tao laughs .
TAO: Do n't give me any ideas .
WALT: Yeah , but it runs like new . They do n't make them like that anymore .
TAO: What are you going to do with it ?
WALT: Sell it . I have n't used it in years and it was always in the way down there .
TAO: How much ?
WALT: Oh , I do n't know . Sixty bucks , maybe . Why , you need a freezer ?
NODS: Our downstairs one died . Walt thinks for a second .
WALT: Twenty-five and it 's yours .
TAO: Twenty-five ? You just said sixty ?
WALT: Save me from wasting money on putting an ad in the paper .
SUE: Kind of ironic , huh ?
WALT: What ?
SUE: What the hell do you think I 'm eferring to ? Toad washing the car he tried to steal from you .
WALT: It seems like justice to me . And if he misses a spot , he 's doing it all over .
SUE: It 's nice of you to kind of look after him like this . He does n't have any real role models in his life .
WALT: I ai n't a role model .
SUE: You 're a good man , Wally . I wish our dad would have been more like you .
WALT: Do n't call me Wally .
SUE: No , I 'm serious . He was hard on us , really traditional , really old school .
WALT: I 'm old school .
SUE: Yeah , but you 're American .
WALT: What 's that supposed to mean ?
SUE: You like him , do n't you ?
WALT: Him ? Do n't be crazy . He tried to steal my car .
SUE: And you spend time with him and you teach him how to fix things and you saved him from that fuck cousin of ours and
WALT: Hey . Watch the language .
SUE: And you 're a good man .
WALT: Hand me a beer , Dragon Lady . Sue hands him a beer and Walt pops the top .
SUE: Hmong girls slip in and out of the culture more easily . Date who we want , stay close to our mothers , ut are able to keep a foot on each side of the fence . The boys fall through the cracks .
WALT: Why ?
SUE: It 's tough . The boys float around . The fathers belong in a totally different world and the oys have no one to turn to . Does that make sense ?
WALT: Not sure . No .
SUE: The boys do n't ask their fathers for advice , because over here , their fathers no longer have the answers .
PAGE 79: Hmong boys become almost invisible , they end up banding together and it all goes to hell from there .
WALT: The girls go to college and the oys go to jail .
SUE: It 's more common than not .
WALT: You still going out with that clown ?
SUE: No . I dumped him . He was a dim- wit . Walt nods .
WALT: Good girl .
TAO: You know , the Hmong conside gardening to be women 's work .
WALT: Is that why I see you out in you garden all the time ? Besides , zipper head , we ai n't in Hu-Mong .
TAO: Funny . Walt lights a cigarette .
WALT: So is joining a gang , you dipshit .
TAO: Seriously , you should quit , I saw you cough up blood .
WALT: So , you ever think about what you want to do with your life ?
TAO: I do n't know .
WALT: You 've never thought about it ?
TAO: Of course I have .
WALT: Well , while you 're thinking about it , try not to stomp all over my chives , you dipshit .
TAO: Sorry .
WALT: Put some mulch around the cucumbers . Tao spreads more mulch .
TAO: I was thinking about sales , maybe .
WALT: My oldest son 's a salesman . He sells cars .
TAO: Does he do well ?
WALT: License to steal . I worked in a Ford plant for thirty years and my son sells goddamned Japanese cars .
TAO: You made cars ?
WALT: That 's right . And I put the steering column in the Gran Torino when it rolled down the line in
TAO: Wow , that 's cool .
WALT: It is , is n't it ?
TAO: Does your son come over much ?
WALT: How are you going about getting into sales ? You thinking about school ?
TAO: Kinda .
WALT: Well , you should .
TAO: School costs money .
WALT: Maybe you should get a job and save instead of spreading mulch in my garden .
TAO: Maybe you could just pay me .
WALT: That 's funny .
TAO: What kind of job could I get ?
WALT: Good question . Who the hell would hire you ?
DEFLATED: Yeah , I know .
WALT: Aw , go on . I 'm kidding . You could get a job , easy .
TAO: Like what ?
WALT: I 'd think about construction .
TAO: Me ? Construction ? What , do you have Alzheimer 's or something ?
WALT: Naw , you could hack it . You just need a little adjustment .
TAO: You said yourself I 'm worthless and I have soft little girl hands .
WALT: That 's exactly the point . I know some guys in the trades , but you have to get your shit together . We have to man you up a bit .
TAO: Man me up ?
WALT: Yes . And you should ask out Yum Yum too .
TAO: Sure .
WALT: Okay , let 's go in .
BARBER: Oh great , a Pollack and a chink .
WALT: Afternoon , Martin , you dum Italian prick .
BARBER: Walt , you cheap asshole , I should have known you 'd come in , I was having such a pleasant day .
WALT: Why , did you jew some blind man out of a few bucks , give him the wrong change ?
BARBER: Who 's the Nip ?
WALT: This is Tao . He 's a pussy kid who lives next door and I 'm trying to man him up a little . Walt points at Tao .
TAO: They do ?
BARBER: What , do you have shit in you ears ?
WALT: Okay . You go out , come back in and give it a try .
TAO: Come on , Walt .
WALT: I said go out there , come back in and talk to the barber like a man . Do it .
TAO: Wus up , you old Italian prick ? The Barber levels a sawed-off SHOTGUN at Tao .
BARBER: Get outta my shop before I blow your head off , you long-haired faggy little gook ! Tao is terrified , frozen stiff .
WALT: Jesus Christ , Toad , you do n't walk in and insult a guy . What are you , an idiot ?
TAO: But but that 's what you said . That 's what you said men say .
WALT: Not if you never met the guy . If you say that shit to the wrong stranger , they 'll blow you goddamned gook head off ! Walt and the Barber laugh again .
TAO: What should I have said ?
WALT: Anything but that .
BARBER: Kid , you shoulda just started with ‘ Hi ' or ‘ Hello . '
WALT: Right . You should have said , ‘ Excuse me , I 'm looking for a haircut if you have time . '
BARBER: Yeah . Be polite , but do n't kiss ass .
WALT: Or , even better is act like you just got off a construction job .
PAGE 85: Or bitch about your girlfriend o getting your car fixed .
BARBER: Right . Son of a bitch , I just got my brakes fixed and those sons a itches really nailed me . Screwed me right in the ass .
WALT: Exactly . Do n't swear at the guy you 're talking to , swear about another guy who ai n't there . My son of a bitch prick fucking boss made me work overtime and he knew I had bowling tonight .
BARBER: Or , my old lady bitches to me fo two fucking hours about how they do n't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the goddamned game , she starts crying how we never talk .
WALT: See ? You come back in , Toad . Be polite and then you bring up something you can both talk about . It ai n't rocket science .
TAO: Yeah , but I do n't have a job or a car or a girlfriend . Walt and the Barber laugh .
BARBER: Sweet Jesus , I shoulda blown his head off when I had the chance .
WALT: Just go back outside and try it again . And do n't mention you 're a pussy with no car , girl , job , future or whatever . Come in and act like a man , Toad . Tao goes out , turns around and comes back in .
TAO: Excuse me , sir , I need a haircut , if you ai n't too busy you Italian son-of-a-bitch prick arber .
PAGE 86: Walt and the Barber laugh
TAO: Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job . Walt and the Barber laugh harder .
WALT: If you do this , you 're going to follow through , right ?
TAO: Yeah , yeah .
WALT: No , not yeah , yeah . Yes , as in yes , sir , I 'll do my best .
TAO: Yes , I 'll do my best .
WALT: You better , because when I vouch for someone , it 's my word and I do n't want anyone making me look ad .
TAO: No , I 'm good . I 'm totally into this .
WALT: And do n't lay down to people all the time . Always look a person in the eye . When you shake a man 's hand , you can usually tell where you stand with him .
TAO: Cool .
WALT: Just do n't blow this .
WALT: Kennedy , you drunken Irish goon , how the hell are ya ?
KENNEDY: Shitty , but who 's gon na listen ?
WALT: Not me .
KENNEDY: Help yourself , Walt , you dum Pollack .
WALT: I already did . This is the kid I told you about . Tao , this is Tim Kennedy , he 's the super on the job .
KENNEDY: What do we got , Walt ?
WALT: He 's done construction here and there . Whatever you need , he 'll pick it up quick .
KENNEDY: You sure ?
WALT: Sure .
KENNEDY: You speak English ?
TAO: Yes , sir .
KENNEDY: You born here ?
TAO: You bet .
KENNEDY: You got a vehicle ? I see Walt drove you here .
TAO: Not at the moment . I 'm taking the us for now .
KENNEDY: The bus ? Jesus Christ , you do n't have a car ?
TAO: My headgasket cracked and the goddamned prick at the shop wants to bend me over for $ 2100 .
KENNEDY: I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard , just under $ 3200 .
TAO: Goddamned thieves . It ai n't ight .
KENNEDY: You got that right . Come on in on Monday and we 'll find something for you to do . Tao puts out his hand to shake .
TAO: Thanks , Mr. Kennedy . Tim Kennedy shakes Tao 's hand .
KENNEDY: It 's Tim . What 's your name again ?
TAO: Tao .
KENNEDY: Okay . You owe me one , Walt .
WALT: I 'll send you a fucking fruitcake at Christmas .
KENNEDY: Fuck the fruitcake , why do n't you hand over the keys to that Gran Torino .
WALT: Yeah , everybody seems to want that car .
KENNEDY: I bet .
WALT: You do n't know the half of it . Come on , zipper head , let 's let this big Mick get back to screwing off . Walt and Tao exit and walk back to the truck .
TAO: What are we doing ?
WALT: What are you gon na put all you tools in , an empty rice bag ?
TAO: I ca n't afford any of this .
WALT: I 'll get it , but you 're paying me ack with your first check .
TAO: Cool . Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao .
WALT: And you need this too . That should about do it .
TAO: Not to bitch , but wo n't I be needing some tools ?
WALT: Tools I got , but I ai n't loaning you my tool belt . You can buy tools as you go .
TAO: I appreciate all this .
WALT: Aw , forget it .
TAO: No , I really do . Thank you .
SPIDER: Just seeing what you 're up to , cuz .
TAO: I 'm getting home from work , not that you guys would know much about that .
SPIDER: So it 's true ? You got a job .
TAO: Come on , what do you guys want with me ?
SMOKIE: Jesus Christ , Tao . What do you think ? I 've been sooooo easy on you , but I ca n't just go on like nothing happened .
TAO: You ca n't just leave me alone ?
SMOKIE: Afraid not .
TAO: Keep your hands off my stuff .
SMOKIE: Your stuff ? You and everything you have is mine . I own you .
WALT: Hey there .
TAO: Hey , I got ta run .
WALT: Wait a minute . Where have you een , I have n't seen you in days ?
TAO: Busy .
WALT: What in the hell happened to you ?
TAO: Do n't worry about it .
WALT: Do n't worry about it ? Look at your goddamned face !
TAO: I said do n't worry about it . It 's not your problem . Walt looks at the ground and spits .
WALT: When ?
TAO: Couple days ago . Grabbed me afte I got off the bus coming home from work .
WALT: Cowards .
TAO: I did everything I could possibly do . They broke some of you tools . I 'll replace them .
WALT: Forget the tools . Where does you cousin live ?
TAO: No , Walt , I can manage . I do n't want you doing anything . Walt is angry , but eventually nods at Tao .
WALT: Alright . You need any other tools for work ?
TAO: I could use a roofing hammer .
WALT: Go in the garage and get whateve you need .
SMOKIE: How the fuck did you get here ? !
WALT: You are n't that hard to track down .
SMOKIE: What do you want ? Walt kicks him a second time .
WALT: I came to give you a chance .
WALT: How do you want your dog I mean steaks cooked ? Medium , medium well ?
TAO: Funny .
WALT: Is this Hmoog or Laab ?
SUE: Laab .
WALT: Is n't it usually a little spicier ? Tao , Wa Xam and Sue laugh .
SUE: Oh whatever , Wally .
WALT: It does . Usually it 's got more zing .
SUE: Jesus Christ , look at you . I 've never seen you like this .
WALT: What ?
SUE: Look at you smile , old man . Kicking back , having a good old time . You 're sure pleased with yourself today .
TAO: And it 's a little unnerving if you ask me .
WALT: Aw , go on .
SUE: No , admit it . You are . You 're feeling pretty good , are n't you ?
WALT: Well , who would n't ? I 'm surrounded by beautiful women , it 's a beautiful day . Great food , good friends . Hell , even Toad is n't driving me nuts for once .
TAO: It never ends .
WALT: I 'm just kidding . Let me tell you something , Yum-Yum . If Tao does n't ask you out soon , I will .
SUE: Do n't listen to him , Wa Xam . He 's a white devil .
LAUGHS: I 'd love to , Walt , but he beat you to it .
WALT: I 'll be damned . Movie ? Dinner ?
SUE: Yeah , they 're taking the bus .
WALT: The bus ? ! That 's no good . A charming young lady like this deserves to go in style .
TAO: Like what ? Take a limo ? Walt nods towards the GRAN TORINO .
WALT: Sure . Why not .
TAO: Really ? Walt smiles .
WALT: Really . They shake hands .
TAO: What what is it ?
WALT: Hang on you 're just cut , is all .
TAO: Is everybody else okay ?
WALT: Yeah .
TAO: It 's a miracle no one was killed .
WALT: They aimed high .
TAO: She went to our aunt 's .
WALT: Call her .
TAO: What ?
WALT: I said call her . Get the goddamned phone and call and see if she 's there . Tao scrambles for the phone and dials .
WALT: This is exactly what I did n't want . Damn gooks . Why the hell am I even here ?
TAO: Maybe one of her friends called and she just changed plans .
WALT: In Korea I learned not to care . The best friends of my life are still missing somewhere in Korea . You harden yourself . Do n't let anything get to you .
FATHER JANOVICH: Mr. Kowalski , are you in here ?
WALT: Come on in .
FATHER JANOVICH: Are you okay ? Walt nods .
WALT: I 've noticed that .
FATHER JANOVICH: What are you saying ?
WALT: You heard what I said .
FATHER JANOVICH: They took Sue to the hospital . She 's scared . They 're all scared .
WALT: I 'm not .
FATHER JANOVICH: I know that . Believe me , they all know that . Tao especially . He 's sitting out there staring at you front door . You know what he expects , Mr. Kowalski .
WALT: Yeah , well what would you do if you were me ? If you were Tao ? What would you do ? Father Janovich shakes his head .
FATHER JANOVICH: I know what I 'd do if I was you , or at least what you think you should do . If I was Tao I guess I 'd want vengeance . I 'd want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys .
WALT: And you ?
FATHER JANOVICH: What would I do ? I 'd come ove here and talk to you I guess . I know you 're close with these people , but this pisses me off too , Mr. Kowalski . Walt nods .
WALT: Wan na beer ?
FATHER JANOVICH: I 'd love one .
WALT: They 're in the cooler , grab me one too .
FATHER JANOVICH: Damn all this . It just is n't fair .
WALT: Nothing 's fair , Father . Father Janovich and Walt sit for awhile .
FATHER JANOVICH: So , what are you going to do , Mr. Kowalski ?
WALT: Call me Walt . Father Janovich nods .
FATHER JANOVICH: Alright , what are you going to do , Walt ?
WALT: Not sure yet . All I do know is they do n't have a goddamned chance .
TAO: What are you doing ?
WALT: I 'm thinking .
TAO: Thinking time is over . Now it 's time to knock the ass out of those pricks .
WALT: I know you do n't want to hea this , but you have to calm down .
TAO: What ? !
WALT: You have to have a clear head , otherwise mistakes get made . Back away from what 's happened , Tao .
TAO: No . Do n't let me down , Walt . Not you . This is going to end , today .
WALT: Sit down .
TAO: I do n't want to sit .
WALT: I SAID SIT DOWN ! Just listen up for a second and do n't say anything . Tao sits down . Walt rubs his hands together .
TAO: I say we go now . Right now .
WALT: And do what ? You want to go kill your cousin and those other Zips . Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is out for blood . What do you even know about it ? Tao is furious , but says nothing .
WALT: I said ‘ okay ? ' You wo n't do anything without me . You meet me ack here at four ? Say ‘ okay . '
TAO: Okay .
WALT: I know , I know . Give me a break , it 's the first time I 've eve smoked in the house .
BARBER: There , all done . Ten bucks American .
WALT: I do n't suppose you still have steady enough hands to give a guy a straight shave , you withered , old Italian mummy ?
BARBER: You ? A straight shave ? You 've never ordered a straight shave , ever .
WALT: That 's right . I always wondered what they were like . Unless you 're too goddamned busy ?
BARBER: No , no . That 's fine . Let me heat up a towel . Walt hands Martin the Barber a twenty .
WALT: Here 's a twenty . Keep the change in case you slip and hit my jugular .
TAILOR: Yes , sir . Take about an hour .
WALT: That 's great . Thank you .
TAILOR: Yes , sir .
WALT: Never had a fitted suit .
FATHER JANOVICH: Mr. Kowalski , what can I do fo you ?
WALT: I 've come for confession .
FATHER JANOVICH: Oh Lord Jesus , what have you done ?
WALT: Nothing . Take it easy .
FATHER JANOVICH: What are you up to ?
WALT: Are you going to let me confess o not ?
FATHER JANOVICH: How long has it been since you last confession ?
WALT: Forever . Bless me , Father , for I have sinned .
FATHER JANOVICH: What are your sins , my son .
WALT: In 1968 , I kissed Betty Jablonski at the work Christmas party . Dorothy was talking with the othe wives and it just happened .
FATHER JANOVICH: Yes . Go on .
WALT: I made nine hundred dollars profit selling a boat and motor and neve eported the taxes which is the same as stealing .
FATHER JANOVICH: Yes . Fine .
WALT: And lastly , I was never close to my two sons . I do n't know them . I did n't know how .
FATHER JANOVICH: That 's it ?
WALT: Whatta you mean , ‘ That 's it ? ' It 's bothered me for years .
FATHER JANOVICH: God loves and forgives you . Say ten ‘ Hail Marys ' and five ‘ Ou Fathers . ' Are you going to etaliate for what happened to Sue ?
WALT: Is that so ?
FATHER JANOVICH: It is . And every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning .
WALT: I got ta go , Padre . Busy day ahead .

GERSTENKORN: What ?
PREYSING: Oh no no the session is over . Let 's go , it 's off . Thank you , gentlemen .
GERSTENKORN: If you actually have news from Manchester then

ZINNOWITZ: You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through .

BARBARA: Do you know what this is ?
PHIL: Did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew how ?
BARBARA: Still the jester Kaufman , and still very unfunny .
PHIL: That 's not a will Barbara , and you know it .
BARBARA: It 's better than a will , actually . It 's a signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings . And anyway , it 's really none of you usiness what this is . I 've come for the guitar .
PHIL: Guitar ?
BARBARA: Yes . Gram 's guitar . He always kept it here .
PHIL: It 's been a while since you were around , Barbara .
BARBARA: I do n't believe you , Kaufman .
PHIL: Hey , well done . You found the only unbroken thing .

SUSIE: Okay . Is that a problem ?
PHIL: Not really .
SUSIE: Well , that 's good .
PHIL: It 's best you do n't know .
SUSIE: I do n't know what this madness is , but I 'm not getting involved .

LARRY: Yes . Welcome to my house .
PHIL: Very nice . What 's that noise ?
LARRY: Manomanjari on the sitar by Nikhil Banerjee . Phil stares at him .
PHIL: Okay .
LARRY: There 's no smoking in here , I 'm afraid .
PHIL: Right .
LARRY: Who are you , please ?
PHIL: Oh , I 'm Phil Kaufman .
LARRY: And how may I help you , Phil Kaufman ?
PHIL: I 'd like to hire your car .
LARRY: Why ?
PHIL: Well , I need to pick someone up at the airport .
LARRY: Do n't you know anyone with a car ?
PHIL: Yes , of course . It 's just that I 'm told your car is more suitable .
LARRY: I see . In what way is my ca more suitable ?
PHIL: Well it 's a hearse .
LARRY: Yes .
PHIL: It 's a joke .
LARRY: A joke ?
PHIL: A prank . A surprise .
LARRY: Well , okay . Is it two hundred dollars worth of surprise ?
PHIL: No , it 's more of a fifty dolla surprise .
LARRY: I can lend you a bicycle . Besides , the car is booked .
PHIL: Booked how ?
MAN: I use it to carry equipment for a and .
PHIL: Well , here 's two hundred dollars to unbook it . Let 'em carry their own trombones .
LARRY: Let 's see ; I 've never met you in my life , you shout through my mail slot , you want to hire my hearse as a joke , and
PHIL: That last twenty is for gas . Anyway - I have n't even seen the car yet . I 'm the one who 's operating on trust .
LARRY: It 's a hearse . What else do you need to know ?
PHIL: Bernice ?
LARRY: Bernice is a Cadillac Superio Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach . We 've got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions pe minute . You 're looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a fou arrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic transmission . Bernice weighs over six thousand pounds .
PHIL: It 's yellow .
LARRY: Yes , it 's yellow . Bernice comes in yellow .
PHIL: It 's supposed to be black .
LARRY: But they 're all black .
PHIL: That might be my point .
LARRY: So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse ?
PHIL: I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse .
LARRY: No , you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse , and a hearse is what you 've got . If you take a long , hard look at Bernice , you 'll see that she 's one of a kind . She 's big , she 's fast , she 's comfortable , and she 's beautiful . But she 's not lack .
PHIL: Okay . Where are the keys ?
LARRY: Why ?
PHIL: I got ta go .
LARRY: Oh , no . She does n't go anywhere without me .
PHIL: Okay . Well , let 's boogie .

BANK MANAGER: I simply ca n't give you any money ased on this piece of paper .
BARBARA: It 's not a piece of paper . It 's a promise from Gram to leave me all his money .
BANK MANAGER: Well , I 'm sorry , but it 's highly likely that the estate will go to probate and be divided up accordingly , subject to a valid will existing .
BARBARA: You do n't seem to understand . These are his wishes .
BANK MANAGER: No I do understand , Miss Mansfield . Really I do .
BARBARA: Please tell me how I 'm supposed to get my money .
BANK MANAGER: Well I imagine that you first need to prove that mister Parsons is actually dead .
BARBARA: Are you saying that I 'm lying ?
BANK MANAGER: No , absolutely not . But getting a copy of the death certificate would probably be a good first step .
STANLEY: I 'm sorry ?
CLERK: Papers ?
PHIL: They 'll be along . With this eing a rush job , they said you 'd understand .
CLERK: Well , you 'd better tell them that we 've got rules .
COP: Excuse me , sir . Is that you hearse ?

CLERK: When you came in , you said you were driving the casket out to New Orleans . But just now you said you were headed for the Joshua Tree
PHIL: Joshua Tree , yeah .

PHIL: It 's small . Just another local community struggling to get by .
CLERK: Hello there . We was looking fo you .
PHIL: Yeah . I 'm a real lucky guy .
COP: I do n't like the look of you .
LARRY: No . Fair enough .

COP: You 're meeting someone off a flight ?
LARRY: Yes .
COP: In a hearse ?
LARRY: Yes . It 's a surprise .
COP: Which parts the surprise The fact that you 're in a bright yellow hearse , the fact that you 're dressed like something out of a horror film , or the fact that you 're half a mile from the terminal and they 're gon na have to walk across two runways to each you ?
LARRY: Well the first part .
COP: The first part .
LARRY: Going on ?
PHIL: Well , I do n't care if it is first thing in the morning - but I sure need a coffee . I tell you , I 've never seen so many darned bits of paper to sign ! It 's paperwork which is slowing this great country down . We 're drowning in triplicate !
COP: Mornin ' .
PHIL: I was just saying how people with work to do - people like yourself , officer - are just getting engulfed by paper . Gra the end , will you ? Does n't that just drive you plain crazy ?
COP: I guess it does .
PHIL: One casket , six sheets to sign . Six ! That ca n't be right . Does that sound right to you ?
COP: Nope . Sure do n't .
PHIL: And the very last thing I want to do is to hold you up further with my chatter . Thank you for you help , officer . You have a good day , now .
COP: Just a moment , boys .
PHIL: Yessir ?
COP: Your sidekick here has just finished telling me that you 're gon na pick someone up from the terminal . A surprise , he said . And here you are loading a coffin into your vehicle
PHIL: And there you have it , officer . You see the gentleman we 're meeting from the plane does n't yet know about the sad passing of his aunt .
COP: And you 're gon na meet him off his flight with her coffin ?
PHIL: Yeah . We 're doing it this way for the avoidance of doubt .
LARRY: Ignition 's a bit temperamental .
COP: Right .
LARRY: Have to use a screwdriver .
COP: I see that .
PHIL: Thanks for everything , officer . We 'd best be off
LARRY: Did what ? What did we do ?
PHIL: What was all that babbling about earlier ?
LARRY: I did n't babble . I just have a problem with authority .
PHIL: What the hell does that mean ?
LARRY: I do n't like them and I do n't know what to say to them . They make me feel uneasy .
PHIL: Well of course they make you feel uneasy . They 're supposed to make you feel uneasy .
LARRY: I clipped it . I clipped the wall .
PHIL: There 's a gap fifty yards wide ! You just had to aim for the gap . How could you miss the gap ?
LARRY: I was distracted . We 're supposed to be picking someone up and you arrive with a coffin and I 'd only just woken up and
PHIL: Hello , officer . I guess they make these hearses wider than they need to
COP: Are you on drugs , boy ?
LARRY: Uh , not at this time , no sir .
COP: Not at this time . Okay , well let 's see . You just missed a gap of fifty yards and hit a wall in oad daylight . Why was that ?
LARRY: Well
PHIL: Well
COP: Now I 'm gon na
PHIL: Fantastic . Well done .
LARRY: Oh , right . So it 's all my fault ?
PHIL: You you just drove into a wall ! Of course it 's your fault . Jesus !
LARRY: Well what ?
PHIL: Well , what are we doing now ?
LARRY: He said to wait .
PHIL: Nice going , hippie . Went right through the gap that time .
LARRY: Get out .
PHIL: What are you talking about ?
LARRY: Get out and take your friend with you .
PHIL: Look , I can see you 're a bit sensitive about this whole casket thing .
LARRY: Get out .
PHIL: Stop saying that ! I ca n't get out .
LARRY: Why not ?
PHIL: I look , it 's not right to throw me out onto the street with a coffin .
LARRY: I 'm driving back to the mortuary .
PHIL: You ca n't do that .
LARRY: Talk .
PHIL: What talk ?
LARRY: Who 's the stiff ?
CLERK: Parsons ?
STANLEY: Parsons .
CLERK: Long blond hair , blue eyes , mid- twenties ?
STANLEY: Well yes .
CLERK: Was he in a Berkeley ?
STANLEY: What 's a Berkeley ?
CLERK: A luxury casket of solid mahogany , finished with a split- hinged lid , eight brass plated casket handles and an engraved inscription plate .
BARBARA: Parsons .
OFFICIAL: Parsons . And he 's a musician ?
BARBARA: Was . He was a musician .
OFFICIAL: I 'm afraid we have no official notification of death .
PHIL: Can we please talk about this later ? This is not a great place to be right now .
STANLEY: You just gave the body away ?
CLERK: Well , it 's not like this is a ank . People round here do n't generally take dead bodies they 're not entitled to .
STANLEY: Why did you give it to him ?
CLERK: Well , he signed for it .
STANLEY: Who signed for it ?
CLERK: John Nobody .
STANLEY: And where do I find this John Nobody ?
CLERK: There .
LARRY: Empty ?
PHIL: Absolutely , completely , totally .
LARRY: It looked pretty heavy , for an empty casket .
PHIL: They are made of finest poplar . That 's very heavy wood .
LARRY: Poplar ? No way ? Mahogany , o oak , but not
PHIL: Look , I 'm not going to argue with you now . Poplar is very well suited to the making of coffins .
LARRY: Okay . So why have we got an empty coffin in the back of the car ?
PHIL: I 'm selling them on to a company in Palm Springs . Lots of stiffs , lots of money . And then of course , it 's very environmentally sound . And look , under the circumstances , perhaps we should renegotiate the financial arrangement between us .
OFFICIAL: Do n't forget now
PHIL: So then Bobby transfers 'em into hardboard boxes just prior to the cremation and I drive the caskets over to a guy I know in Palm Springs who resells them .
LARRY: As new ?
PHIL: Well I 'm not sure the 'one careful owner ' thing works with coffins .
LARRY: The whole thing is completely immoral .
PHIL: Yeah , well . I saw how outraged you were back there , when I mentioned money . Just think of it as recycling .
LARRY: Look , I really need to get home .
PHIL: Why ?
LARRY: I just do .
PHIL: Well , while I acknowledge the power of your argument , we have to be somewhere else . So just settle back and enjoy the ride . Larry slows the car down .
LARRY: Gas now .
ATTENDANT: You an undertaker ?
PHIL: Sure am .
ATTENDANT: Ai n't yer surposed to be in lack ?
PHIL: Nope . We 're special rock ' n roll undertakers . Musical morticians .
ATTENDANT: This car runs on regular .
PHIL: Who says it 's for the car ?
ATTENDANT: Ai n't fer the car ?
PHIL: Nope .
LARRY: We could go back .
PHIL: Why would we want to do that ?
LARRY: I was n't expecting a long trip . I have n't packed any spare clothes . We could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow .
PHIL: You want to go home to pick up fresh clothes ?
LARRY: Well , yes .
PHIL: And then drive back out tomorrow ?
LARRY: We could do that .
PHIL: Just drive the car , okay ?
LARRY: We could just
PHIL: No .
LARRY: It would
PHIL: No .
PHIL: No .
BARBARA: You might need to repeat that .
LARRY: I still do n't fully understand what you do .
PHIL: Well , I do everything .
LARRY: Everything ?
PHIL: This little number is fo drinking money . By trade I 'm a Road Manager .
LARRY: Oh , one of those . Like a well- paid gopher .
PHIL: No , not like a well-paid gopher . I 'm responsible for movement , maintenance and management . I 'm a confidante and a companion , a partner and a patron , an ally , agent and ambassador . I 'm like an executive nanny . Not a gopher .
LARRY: An executive nanny , not a gopher . Thanks for clearing that up .
STANLEY: So where are the cops ?
CLERK: I called them .
STANLEY: There 's supposed to be a funeral in New Orleans . I need to find my boy .
CLERK: New Orleans ? Clerk points into the distance .
STANLEY: Joshua Tree ?
BARBARA: Where 's the son of a bitch ?
SUSIE: The son of a bitch is n't here .
BARBARA: Well , he 's stolen Gram .
SUSIE: Stolen Gram ?
BARBARA: They had some kind of weird pact . I think Phil 's taken Gram out to the desert .
SUSIE: Why ?
BARBARA: Some kind of voodoo thing with hot wax and dolls to stick pins in .
SUSIE: Do n't be ridiculous .
BARBARA: Now that is a wise move , if you ask me .
SUSIE: I did n't ask you .
BARBARA: You 'll learn about Phil Kaufman . If you stick around long enough .
SUSIE: And you know him ?
BARBARA: I know he 's a brainless , interfering asshole , yes .
SUSIE: I do n't need to listen to this garbage .
BARBARA: That 's him , is n't it ?
SUSIE: Generally , it 's best to answe the phone to discover who 's calling .
BARBARA: Fine .
PHIL: Hello baby , it 's the love machine . How are ya ?
BARBARA: Hello Kaufman . I know what you 're up to , you thieving astard . I know where you 're going , and I know about you sick , revolting plans , and I 'm coming after you . And when I catch you
PHIL: Hello Barbara . How nice to hea from you again . And so soon
BARBARA: Sonofabitch !
SUSIE: You do n't know shit about him .
BARBARA: Well why do n't we find out ?
PHIL: So what 's that about ?
LARRY: Sunstroke .
PHIL: You 've hardly left the car since we met . How can you have sunstroke ?
LARRY: I 'm susceptible .
PHIL: You 're a winner , that 's what you are . A winner
LARRY: This is n't the way to Palm Springs . Phil winks at him .
PHIL: It is if you 're a coffin smuggler .
STANLEY: Good afternoon .
OLD WOMAN: Hello .
STANLEY: I 'll take that one , please .
OLD WOMAN: Fifty cents .
STANLEY: I was wondering Have you seen a hearse pass this way in the last couple of hours ?
OLD WOMAN: What 's it look like ?
STANLEY: Well It It 's a big car . A ig yellow car . Two guys inside .
OLD WOMAN: Was one of 'em sick in them ushes ?
STANLEY: Well I do n't know . Maybe .
OLD WOMAN: Yup . I seen it .
LARRY: See , the Yin is the negative - the darkside . And the Yang epresents positive - good . If you like , the first is earth and the second heaven .
PHIL: It would be really nice if we could get through a couple of hours without crashing the car .
LARRY: I was distracted .
PHIL: Of course you were .
LARRY: What now ?
PHIL: Pretend we 're having a conversation .
LARRY: Okay . What about ?
PHIL: I do n't know what about ! Eve since I met you , you 've talked . Yabba , yabba , yabba , every waking minute . Religion , you supersonic , supercharged car , the darkside . Now you need to talk , and you ca n't think of anything to say .
LARRY: Well it 's more a philosophy than a religion .
PHIL: Oh , well done . Good work .
MOTORCYCLE COP: Afternoon .
PHIL: Afternoon , officer . How 's it going today ?
MOTORCYCLE COP: Oh , it 's going fine , thank you . How are things with you ?
PHIL: Fine , fine . We just stopped to take a look at
MOTORCYCLE COP: Well , it is mighty nice around these parts . If you like desert .
LARRY: Ooooh , I 'm well . Really well , actually . Thank you .
MOTORCYCLE COP: The reason I ask , is that you appear to have driven into one of our road signs .
LARRY: Oh .
MOTORCYCLE COP: I 'm surprised that you had n't noticed earlier , as it does appear to be impeding you forward progress .
PHIL: That 's a great line
MOTORCYCLE COP: Thank you .
PHIL: Anything .
MOTORCYCLE COP: I 'm looking for some fellows who stole a body back there at the airport . Larry wobbles with shock .
LARRY: A body ? Stole a body ?
MOTORCYCLE COP: A body . Rather like the one in the back of your car .
LARRY: That 's an empty coffin , officer .
MOTORCYCLE COP: I know it sounds strange . But these guys - there are two of them - they stole a body , loaded it into the back of an old yellow hearse painted with flowers , and they 're supposed to be driving out this way .
LARRY: Hearse . Flowers .
PHIL: I think he 's onto us , Larry . He 's just having a little fun at our expense .
MOTORCYCLE COP: In the car , please .
PHIL: God damn !
LARRY: He said a body . He said we stole a body .
PHIL: He meant a coffin .
LARRY: He did n't say 'coffin ' . He said 'body ' . Tell me we have n't stolen a real person .
PHIL: Look , the place that I get the coffins from probably have n't filed a report yet . It 'll all be sorted out within the hour . Trust me .
LARRY: Oh , I 'm just overflowing with trust for you , man . I feel this overwhelming feeling of trust every time I look at you .
PHIL: Jesus !
LARRY: What are we going to do ?
PHIL: Time .
LARRY: What ?
PHIL: We 're going to be arrested , that 's what we 're going to do . Then we 'll go to court and then we 'll go to jail and we 'll do that for a while .
LARRY: What about if I could slip out of these cuffs ?
PHIL: Yeah , that would be great . Then we could suspend you from a idge in a straitjacket and set the rope on fire .
LARRY: No , really . I really can slip these cuffs .
PHIL: Okay . Show me .
LARRY: Do you think we should go ?
PHIL: Yes , I think we should go .
LARRY: Oh shit .
PHIL: Nicely done .
LARRY: The steering lock is on .
PHIL: Well turn it off !
LARRY: I ca n't - he 's got the keys .
PHIL: So , we 've escaped but we can only drive in a circle ?
LARRY: Yes .
PHIL: Can we please go ?
LARRY: Okay .
SUSIE: If you hate Phil so much , why are you chasing him across California ?
BARBARA: He 's got Gram and I need him .
SUSIE: Well , that 's really touching . But you 've got to come to terms with the fact that he 's dead .
BARBARA: I know he 's dead , Honey . But he has n't been officially identified , and there 's no certificate of death .
SUSIE: I do n't understand .
BARBARA: Let 's just say I 'm overly sentimental , okay ?
SUSIE: This is all about money , is n't it ?
BARBARA: Is n't everything ?
SUSIE: Why do you think you deserve anything ?
BARBARA: I was a great support to Gram efore Kaufman came along and spoiled the party .
SUSIE: Phil 's not responsible for you problems with Gram .
BARBARA: What do you know ?
SUSIE: I know that he can be a pain in the ass , but when it came to Gram , Phil only ever did the ight thing .
BARBARA: In his whole life , Phil Kaufman did n't do anything because it was the right thing to do . You can et the ranch that wherever he is , he 's having some fun .
SUSIE: Maybe that 's what I like about him .
BARBARA: Sure it is , honey . That 's why your bags were packed .
SUSIE: Have you any idea what it 's like to really love someone ?
BARBARA: You might exclusively love Phil Kaufman - but unfortunately , so does he . You 're just handy to have around .
SUSIE: I do n't have to listen to this .
BARBARA: The truth can hurt , ca n't it ?
LARRY: Well , that 's it ! They 're going to lock me up and throw away the key .
PHIL: Why would they do that ?
LARRY: You saw what happened . I drove over that cop 's bike . That 's destruction of police property , or something .
PHIL: You worry too much .
LARRY: Not 'til I met you
PHIL: Jesus - what the hell is that ?
LARRY: It 's a dinosaur .
PHIL: Very perceptive . What 's it doing ?
LARRY: 'The Polyonax Place ' . A Polyonax is probably some kind of dinosaur .
PHIL: Pull over - let 's eat .
LARRY: Let 's not . The cops 'll be afte us and we should just get on to Palm Springs and do the thing , and then I can get home and you can do whatever it is you do . Let 's do that .
PHIL: We need to stop . I 'm starting to get hungry . I 'm not nice hungry .
LARRY: You surprise me . I vote we keep going .
PHIL: What gave you the impression this was a democracy ?
LARRY: I do not .
PHIL: Everyone else , he announces the food when he brings it . Diplodocus this and Allosaurus that . Us he just slaps it down and runs for cover .
LARRY: Look , I 'm a vegetarian . I have a problem with dead flesh . Okay ?
PHIL: I understand . Really I do . That stuff 'll mess you right up every time .
LARRY: I thought you were hungry .
PHIL: Got ta make a call .
BARMAN: Out back .

PHIL: Yeah , that 'll be it . Shopping .
STANLEY: Beer . The barman gives Stanley his beer .
BARMAN: Sure .
STANLEY: Yeaaaaah . Yeah , a real bad day .
BARMAN: What happened ?
STANLEY: My boy died out here the othe day , and some punks have stolen his body .
BARMAN: That 's worth a shot on the house .
STANLEY: Thanks .
PHIL: We got ta go .
LARRY: Have n't finished my drink .
BARMAN: Why would someone steal a body ?
PHIL: All gone . C'mon .
STANLEY: Well , maybe they were souveni hunters or something . My boy 's kinda famous
BARMAN: Who is he ?
STANLEY: Gram Parsons . The Barman looks surprised .
BARMAN: Gram Parsons ?
LARRY: Gram Parsons ?
PHIL: Better get going .
LARRY: He said someone took Gram Parson 's body . Two people
PHIL: Yeah , he was a real blabbermouth . In fact , I thought he was neve gon na stop talking . Anyway , although that 's real interesting , we 've got ta keep to the schedule .
LARRY: Schedule ? What schedule ? There is no schedule
PHIL: Well , I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible , do n't you ? Get our package to Palm Springs . Remember ?
LARRY: Package ? We 've stolen that man 's son .
PHIL: Stolen his son ? That 's outrageous ! I 'm appalled that you could even think we 'd do such a thing .
LARRY: I do n't know what you take me for . I want to see in that box .
PHIL: We 've really got to go .
LARRY: It 's heavy .
PHIL: Okay , then . Well , if you 're satisfied , let 's go .
LARRY: I said it 's heavy .
PHIL: Heavy , yes . Well , it is made of wood . Wood is heavy . Actually .
LARRY: Yeah , I remember . Finest poplar .
PHIL: Gosh , they must have given us a full one . We 'll have to sort that all out when we get to Palm Springs and
LARRY: Oh my God . You stole Gram Parsons .
PHIL: Well , technically , we stole Gram Parsons .
LARRY: I stole a coffin , I did n't know there was a body in it .
PHIL: I 'd save that line for court .
LARRY: I do n't know ! What am I doing ? I mean What-am-I-doing ? Why am I here ? Why am I with you ?
PHIL: Calm down .
LARRY: I thought it was bad enough when I ran over the cop 's bike , but now I 'm a fucking body snatcher .
PHIL: Well , when you 've quite finished , we should go .
LARRY: Go ? You go . I tell you what I 'm going to do . I 'm going inside and I 'm going to give that man his son back . I 'm going to do the right thing , I 'm going to follow my conscience , I 'm going to
PHIL: Shit !
STANLEY: Son of a bitch !
SUSIE: You 're not a very nice person , are you ?
BARBARA: Nice ? No , I suppose not . Does it matter ?
SUSIE: It might get you further .
BARBARA: I do okay . Listen , I was an orphan at fourteen and a waitress at fifteen . I do what I do ecause it puts food on my table , and because if I do n't look afte myself , no-one else will .
SUSIE: So what do you want from us ?
BARBARA: I do n't want anything from you . It would be a bonus to see Kaufman crash and burn , but I do n't need to be there when it happens .
SUSIE: Why do you hate Phil so much ?
BARBARA: Gram was the first good guy I ever hooked up with . He was n't perfect , but it worked between us . We just seemed to fit together . But Gram was already wild , and I made him wilder . Kaufman watched over him like a hawk , and when he felt things were getting out of control , he turned Gram against me . I lost the only decent thing in my life .
SUSIE: Surely Phil was just looking after Gram ?
BARBARA: Gram was an adult . He did n't need a nursemaid .
SUSIE: Except that now he 's dead .
BARBARA: Yeah . Without my help and while Kaufman was babysitting .
SUSIE: I do n't like you much , Barbara .
BARBARA: That 's fine . I just want what 's mine and then I 'm gone . Gone eal fast .
PHIL: Welcome back , hippie .
LARRY: So why d'ya do it ?
PHIL: Do what ?
LARRY: Have a guess .
PHIL: Well , I gave my word . This is what Gram wanted .
LARRY: What , cruise around the desert until he starts to smell ? Were you - both bombed ?
PHIL: Do you have friends ?
LARRY: Of course I have friends .
PHIL: Well , what would you do for them ?
LARRY: Anything , within reason .
PHIL: That 's what I hate about people like you . Everything 's 'within eason ' . There are always oundaries , provisos . You only operate with a safety net .
LARRY: Tell me something - if it was the other way round , would Gram be sitting here , driving your bones out into the desert ?
PHIL: You 've missed the point . See , it does n't matter what he would do , or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is the correct way to behave . To me , it only matters what I do . Where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds - I only have right and wrong . If I make a promise , I keep it - that 's right . If I eak that promise - that 's wrong .
LARRY: Ohmygod .
STANLEY: Yeah ?
LARRY: Hi .
STANLEY: Hello .
LARRY: Um . I 'm one of the guys that took your son .
STANLEY: You 'd better come in .
BARBARA: Where 's the catch on this piece of shit ?
SUSIE: Phil ? Phil !
PHIL: A hippie hit it . I thought you 'd gone .
SUSIE: Hold that thought .
PHIL: What the hell does that mean ?
SUSIE: I need to know what it is you 're doing .
BARBARA: I told you what he 's doing ! He 's going to set fire to my Gram in some freaky ceremony with witches and black magic and dolls .
PHIL: Dolls ?
SUSIE: Dolls to stick pins in .
PHIL: What the hell are you talking about ?
BARBARA: I want my man back !
PHIL: Enough of this shit .
STANLEY: You 're Kaufman ?
PHIL: Yup .
STANLEY: And you are ?
SUSIE: I 'm with him .
BARBARA: Hello Stanley . Remember me ? The psychotic girlfriend ?
STANLEY: Hello Barbara . Nothing wrong with your memory .
LARRY: Well , I did n't even know he was in the box .
PHIL: I 'm going to cremate him , here in the desert where he felt most at home . That 's what he wanted .
BARBARA: The hell you are , Kaufman .
STANLEY: You know I ca n't let you do that ?
PHIL: I know you have to .
STANLEY: I do n't have to do anything , Mister Kaufman . This is MY loss ! This was MY son ! How dare you try to take my grief away from me .
PHIL: It 's too late to claim him now .
STANLEY: What the hell does that mean ?
PHIL: It means that you were neve there when it mattered to Gram . It means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding . It means that you learned to care too late . That 's what it means .
STANLEY: I do n't have to justify my elationship with Gram to you .
PHIL: Not to me , no .
STANLEY: It 's true that when Gram left college , we drifted apart .
PHIL: No - he gave it his all , but in a way you could never understand . And all he ever wanted from you was approval . He wanted you to e proud of what he had achieved .
STANLEY: I kept everything . Every record , every article , every photo .
PHIL: It 's no good telling me . You should have told him .
STANLEY: I loved him .
PHIL: Too late
STANLEY: I understand that you were his ight-hand man , as well as his friend ?
PHIL: I was both , yes .
STANLEY: And that you were n't there when he died ? When he needed you most ?
PHIL: Yes . That 's right .
STANLEY: So the guilt is n't all mine , then ?
PHIL: I guess not .
STANLEY: You boys took away my son . I lost him once in life , and now you 're trying to take him from me again .
BARBARA: Can we just cut through this ?
STANLEY: Son , you had your chance to look after Gram , and now he 's dead .
BARBARA: Bastard !
PHIL: I only failed because I could n't save him from himself . You failed him all his life . You never believed . I never doubted .
STANLEY: Okay . You tell me why I should let you take my boy .
PHIL: I was his road manager and his friend . We loved it out here in the desert , and we made a pact that whoever died first , the other would come down here and set them free . Gram gave his word and I gave mine .
STANLEY: You 're a couple of druggies . Why should I believe you ?
PHIL: I do n't take drugs .
STANLEY: What about you ? Are you a druggie ?
LARRY: Yes . Yes I am .
PHIL: Nice work . Let 's go .
LARRY: I ca n't do this . This is n't ight .
SUSIE: Just do whatever feels right to you .
PHIL: God damn !
STANLEY: No .
PHIL: Are you going to call them ?
STANLEY: Well , you have n't given me a eason not to .
PHIL: There is n't a reason . If someone tried to steal my son 's body , I 'd stop them . For sure .
STANLEY: So you are prepared to go to jail ?
PHIL: I 'm expecting to .
BARBARA: Do n't you worry - it 's gon na happen !
LARRY: Mister Parsons ?
STANLEY: What is it , son ?
LARRY: I 've been a junkie for over fou years . I started taking heroin on June 5th 1969 at a concert in Indiana . I
STANLEY: You do n't need
LARRY: I 've taken heroin , speed , uppers , downers , blues , morphine , methadone , mushrooms , quaaludes , acid , valium , barbiturates , straight LSD , marijuana , marijuana laced with opium , nembutal , mescalin of course , and medical methaqualone , which made me shake uncontrollably for six weeks and vomit every hour .
STANLEY: That 's very impressive , son .
LARRY: Not my point .
PHIL: Better make the point .
LARRY: I started working my way through that list on June 5th 1969 , and since then there has n't been a day when I did n't at least smoke one joint .
PHIL: Are we sure that this is helping ?
LARRY: And now I 've stopped . I stopped ecause it seems that I had something more important to do .
STANLEY: I 'm going to go say goodbye to my son .
PHIL: What 's that for ?
SUSIE: That 's for failing to reinforce my expectations .
PHIL: Well I 'll have to do that more often .
LARRY: Of course not .
PHIL: C'mon , time to go
LARRY: Yeah , he took the body and stuffed it in the trunk of his car before escaping into the night .
PHIL: Are you coming ?
SUSIE: I reckon I am .
BARBARA: Thank God !
TRAFFIC COP: Evenin ' ma'am .
BARBARA: Please help me , they 've got my oyfriend 's corpse and they 're going to perform a ritual with his body .
TRAFFIC COP: May I see your driving license please , ma'am ?
BARBARA: My driving license ?
TRAFFIC COP: Please .
BARBARA: I 've just told you that they 've stolen a body and you want to see my driving license ?
TRAFFIC COP: Yes it is , ma'am . And yes I am .
PHIL: Cap Rock . This is perfect . Really peaceful
LARRY: What now ?
PHIL: Now we do it .
LARRY: Why ?
PHIL: Flesh burns easier than wood .
LARRY: I ca n't believe you just said that . I 'm not taking the top off .
PHIL: Hey , man . Looking a little peaky
SUSIE: Some decorum would be nice .
PHIL: Right .
LARRY: Well , I do n't know . Maybe a little more .
PHIL: Enough ?
SUSIE: I 'm not having a conversation with you about how much gasoline you need to burn a body .
LARRY: I think that 'll do it .
PHIL: Only a little left .
TRAFFIC COP: Jesus ! What the hell 's that ?
BARBARA: That 'll be Gram Parsons , on fire .
TRAFFIC COP: Get in the car , ma'am . Now .
LARRY: Maybe too much fuel .
PHIL: Nah , I just did n't factor in the ooze inside of him . Gram always
TRAFFIC COP: How do you know it 's you oyfriend ?
BARBARA: I recognize that birthmark on his shoulder . Look , can I make an observation ?
TRAFFIC COP: Be my guest .
BARBARA: We 're in the desert . It is dark . If you want to catch someone in the dark , it 's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren .
TRAFFIC COP: Do you want to know what I think , ma'am ?
BARBARA: No . But I 'm really , really keen to find out .
TRAFFIC COP: I think it was suicide . He just wanted to get away from you .
GRAM: Sure is hot .
PHIL: Hello , Gram .
GRAM: Phil .
PHIL: Do you think you should ?
GRAM: Not gon na hurt me now , is it ?
PHIL: They 're very handy fo transporting dead people around . Nothing better .
GRAM: I am dead , then ?
PHIL: You 're more than dead , Gram . You and the box are down to bones and ass .
GRAM: Oh , well . Here 's mud in you eye .
PHIL: What can I do for you , Gram ?
GRAM: You assume I want something .
PHIL: Well , you 're here . And seeing as I just burned you to a cinder , you should n't be .
GRAM: Well , okay . I just wanted to say thanks .
PHIL: What for ?
GRAM: Doing the thing that we agreed , keeping your word , keeping them all away
PHIL: Well , that 's okay , Gram . But I do n't need thanking .
GRAM: You do n't ?
PHIL: I 'm just taking care of business . That 's what you paid me for - that 's what I do .
GRAM: You shooting for a raise ?
PHIL: Actually , I just quit .
GRAM: Well , I s'pose I should be getting along .
PHIL: Goodbye , Gram . I 'm glad it all worked out .
GRAM: What ?
PHIL: I said I 'm glad it all worked out .
LARRY: All what worked out ?
PHIL: Does n't matter . Can we go now ? I 'm getting sick of sand .
LARRY: Well , we did it . We saved a soul .
PHIL: Singed my damn mustache , that 's for sure .
LARRY: Well , shall we ?
PHIL: Yeah . Let 's roll , hippie .
SUSIE: I 'll be waiting .
PHIL: Yeah , but where ?
SUSIE: Get out of here . Finish it .
WAITRESS: When you be back ?
DRIVER: Couple a weeks . Do n't do nothin ' you would n't want me to hear about !
TOM: How about a lift , mister ?
DRIVER: Ca n't you see that sticker ?
TOM: Sure I see it . But a good guy do n't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck .
DRIVER: Scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend .
TOM: Just a few miles . I 'd a walked he if my dogs was n't pooped out .
DRIVER: Lookin ' for a job ?
TOM: No , my old man got a place , forty acres . He 's a sharecropper , but we een there a long time .
DRIVER: Oh !

DRIVER: I do n't stick my nose in nobody 's usiness .
TOM: Nawnot much !
DRIVER: I stay in my own yard .
TOM: Listen . That big nose of yours been goin ' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch . But I ai n't keepin ' it a secret . I been in the penitentiary . Been there four years . Like to know anything else ?
DRIVER: You ai n't got to get sore .
TOM: Go ahead . Ask me anything you want .
DRIVER: I did n't mean nothing .
TOM: Me neither . I 'm just tryin ' to get along without shovin ' anybody around , that 's all . See that road up ahead ?
DRIVER: Yeah .

DRIVER: I never asked you !
TOM: Sure , but you 'd a throwed a fit if I had n't tol ' you .
CASY: Mmmmm he 's my saviour . Mmmmm my saviour , Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now . Howdy , friend .
TOM: Howdy .
CASY: Say , ai n't you young Tom Joadol ' Tom 's boy ?
TOM: Yeah . On my way home now .
CASY: Well , I do declare ! I baptized you , son .
TOM: Why , you 're the preacher !
CASY: *Used* to be . Not no more . I lost the call . But boy , I sure *used* to have it ! I 'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin ' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em ! But not no more . I lost the sperit .
TOM: Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher .
CASY: I got nothin ' to preach about no morethat 's all . I ai n't so sure o ' things .
TOM: Maybe you should a got yourself a wife .
CASY: At my meetin 's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin ' till they about passed out . Then , I 'd go to comfort 'emand always end up by lovin ' 'em . I 'd feel bad , an ' pray , an ' pray , but it did n't do no good . Next time , do it again . I figgered there just was n't no hope for me .
TOM: I never let one go by me when I could catch her .
CASY: But you was n't a preacher . A girl was just a girl to you . But to me they was holy vessels . I was savin ' their souls . I ast myselfwhat *is* this call , the Holy Sperit ? Maybe *that's* love . Why , I love everybody so much I 'm fit to bust sometimes ! So maybe there ai n't no sin an ' there ai n't no virtue . There 's just what people do . Some things folks do is nice , and some ai n't so nice . But that 's as far as any man 's got a right to say .
TOM: Have a little snort ?
CASY: Course I 'll say grace if somebody sets out the food but my heart ai n't in it . Nice drinkin ' liquor .
TOM: Ought to be . That 's fact'ry liquor . Cost me a buck .
CASY: Been out travelin ' around ?
TOM: Did n't you hear ? It was in the papers .
CASY: No , I never . What ?
TOM: I been in the penitentiary for fou years .
CASY: Excuse me for asking .
TOM: I do n't mind any more . I 'd do what I done again . I killed a guy at a dance . We was drunk . He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel . Knocked his head plumb to squash .
CASY: And you ai n't ashamed ?
TOM: He had a knife in me . That 's why they only gave me seven years . Got out in fourparole .
CASY: Ai n't you seen your folks since then ?
TOM: No , but I aim to before sundown . Gettin ' kind of excited about it , too . Which way you going ?
CASY: It do n't matter . Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other . I 'll go your way .
TOM: Maybe Ma 'll have pork for supper . I ai n't had pork but four times in four yearsevery Christmas .
CASY: I 'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin ' , an ' he had one a the bigges ' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen . He go to jumpin ' over bushes , howlin ' like a dog-wolf in moon-time . Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an ' he let out a squawk an ' took a run at that bush . Well , sir , he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two . They was a travellin ' dentist there and he set her , an ' I give her a prayin ' over , but they was n't no more Holy Sperit in you pa after that .
TOM: Lissen . This wind 's fixi n't to *do* somepin ' !
CASY: Shore it is . It always is , this time a year .
TOM: Just around that next bend .
CASY: Your granma was a great one , too . The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist .
TOM: That 's our place .
CASY: And it ai n't any too close , either ! We better run !
TOM'S VOICE: Ma ? Pa ? Ai n't nobody here ? Somepin 's happened .
CASY'S VOICE: You got a match ?
TOM'S VOICE: There was some pieces of candle always on a shelf .
TOM: They 're all goneor dead .
CASY: They never wrote you nothing ?
TOM: No . They was n't people to write .
CASY: I never heard nothin ' about it .
MULEY: Tommy ?
TOM: Muley ! Where 's my folks , Muley ?
MULEY: They gone .
TOM: I know that ! But *where* they gone ?
CASY: I ai n't no preacher anymore .
TOM: All right , you remember the *man* then .
MULEY: Gone over to your Uncle John 's . The whole crowd of 'em , two weeks ago . But they ca n't stay there either , ecause John 's got *his* notice to get off .
TOM: But what 's happened ? How come they got to get off ? We been here fifty yearssame place .
MULEY: Ever'body got to get off . Ever'body leavin ' , goin ' to California . My folks , your folks , ever'body 's folks . Ever'body but me . I ai n't gettin ' off .
TOM: But who done it ?
MULEY: Listen ! That 's some of what done itthe dusters . Started it , anyway . Blowin ' like this , year after yearblowin ' the land away , blowin ' the crops away , blowin ' us away now .
TOM: Are you crazy ?
MULEY: Some say I am . You want to hear what happened ?
TOM: That 's what I asked you , ai n't it ?
MULEY: The way it happensthe way it happened to methe man come one day
THE MAN: Fact of the matter , Muley , afte what them dusters done to the land , the tenant system do n't work no more . It do n't even break even , much less show a profit . One man on a tracto can handle twelve or fourteen of these places . You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop .
MULEY: But we could n't *do* on any less ' n what our share is now . The chillun ai n't gettin ' enough to eat as it is , and they 're so ragged we 'd be shamed if ever'body else 's chillun was n't the same way .
THE MAN: I ca n't help that . All I know is I got my orders . They told me to tell you you got to get off , and that 's what I 'm telling you .
MULEY: You mean get off my own land ?
THE MAN: Now do n't go blaming me . It ai n't *my* fault .
SON: Whose fault is it ?
THE MAN: You know who owns the landthe Shawnee Land and Cattle Company .
MULEY: Who 's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny ?
THE MAN: It ai n't nobody . It 's a company .
SON: They got a pres'dent , ai n't they ? They got somebody that knows what a shotgun 's for , ai n't they ?
THE MAN: But it ai n't *his* fault , because the *bank* tells him what to do .
SON: All right . Where 's the bank ?
THE MAN: Tulsa . But what 's the use of picking on him ? He ai n't anything but the manager , and half crazy hisself , trying to keep up with his orders from the east !
MULEY: Then who *do* we shoot ?
THE MAN: Brother , I do n't know . If I did I 'd tell you . But I just do n't know *who's* to blame !
MULEY: Well , I 'm right here to tell you , mister , ai n't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land ! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago . My pa was born here . We was *all* born on it , and some of us got killed on it , and some died on it . And that 's what makes it ournbein ' born on it , and workin ' it , and dyin ' on itand not no piece of paper with writin ' on it ! So just come on and try to push me off !
TOM: Well ?
MULEY: They come . They come and pushed me off . We see MULEY at close range .
TOM'S VOICE: The what ?
MULEY: The catsthe caterpillar tractors .
MULEY'S VOICE: And for ever ' one of 'em ten-fifteen families gets throwed outa thei homesone hundred folks with no place to live but on the road . The Rances , the Perrys , the Peterses , the Joadsesone after another they got throwed out . Half the folks you and me knowthrowed right out into the road . The one that got me come a month ago .
MULEY: You come any closer and I 'm gon na low you right outa that cat !
DAVIS: I do n't like nobody drawin ' a bead on me .
MULEY: Then what are you doin ' this kind a thing foragainst your own people ?
DAVIS: For three dollars a day , that 's what I 'm doin ' it for . I got two little kids . I got a wife and my wife 's mother . Them people got to eat . Fust and on ' y thing I got to think about is my own folks . What happens to other folks is their lookout .
MULEY: But this is *my land* , son . Do n't you understand ?
DAVIS: *Used* to be your land . B'longs to the comp'ny now .
GIRL: What 's he fixin ' to do , ma ?
MA: Hush ! Back to the TRACTOR AND THE MEN
MULEY: Have it your own way , son , but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I 'm gon na blow you plumb to kingdom come .
DAVIS: You ai n't gon na blow nobody nowhere . First place , you 'd get hung and you know it . For another , it would n't be two days before they 'd have anothe guy here to take my place .
WIFE: Do n't ! Please do n't ! The little girl begins to whimper .
MULEY: I 'm tellin ' you !
TOM: But it do n't seem possiblekicked off like that !
MULEY: The rest of my fambly set out fo the westthere was n't nothin ' to eatbut I could n't leave . Somepin ' would n't let me . So now I just wande around . Sleep wherever I am . I used to tell myself I was lookin ' out fo things , so when they come back ever'thing would be all right . But I knowed that wa n't true . There ai n't nothin ' to look out for . And ai n't nobody comin ' back . They 're gone and me , I 'm just an 'ol graveyard ghostthat 's all in the world I am . Tom rises in his agitation and bewilderment .
CASY: No . You 're lonelybut you ai n't touched .
MULEY: It do n't matter . If I 'm touched , I 'm touched , and that 's all there is to it .
TOM: What I ca n't understand is my folks takin ' it ! Like ma ! I seen her nearly eat a peddler to death with a live chicken . She aimed to go for him with an ax she had in the other hand ut she got mixed up and forgot which hand was which and when she got through with that peddler all she had left was two chicken legs . He looks down at Muley .
MULEY: Just a plain 'ol graveyard ghost , that 's all .
TOM: She 's settlin ' .
CASY: What you figger to do ?
TOM: It 's hard to say . Stay here till mornin ' an ' then go on over to Uncle John 's , I reckon . After that I do n't know .
MULEY: Listen ! That 's them ! Them lights ! Come on , we got to hide out !
TOM: Hide out for what ? We ai n't doin ' nothin ' .
MULEY: You 're *trespassin'* ! It ai n't you lan ' no more ! An ' that 's the supr'tendantwith a gun !
CASY: Come on , Tom . You 're on parole .
MULEY: All you got to do is lay down an ' watch .
TOM: Wo n't they come out here ?
MULEY: I do n't think so . One come out here once an ' I clipped him from behin ' with a fence stake . They ai n't othered since .
MAN: Muley ? He ai n't here . The car moves on .
TOM: Anybody ever 'tol me I 'd be hidin ' out on my own place ! He whistles , as the scene fades out .
MA'S VOICE: Lord , make us thankful for what we are about to receive , for His sake . Amen .
GRANMA: I seen you ! You et durin ' grace !
GRAMPA: One little ole dab ! one teeny little ole dab !
RUTHIE: Ai n't he messy though !
GRANMA: I seen him ! gobblin ' away like an ole pig !
GRAMPA: Why n't you keep your eyes shet durin ' grace , you ole
NOAH: What 's it say again ?
JOHN: Says plenty work in California peaches . Eight hundred pickers needed . Noah frowns at the print .
GRAMPA: Wait 'll I get to California ! Gon na each up and pick me an orange whenever I want it ! Or grapes . That there 's somethin ' I ai n't *never* had enough of ! Gon na get me a whole unch a grapes off a bush and I 'm gon na squash 'em all over my face and just let the juice dreen down offen my chin !
GRANMA: Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory !
GRAMPA: Maybe I get me a whole *washtub* fulla them grapes and jest sit in 'em and scrooge around till they was gone ! I shore would like to do that !
RUTHIE: Look . I 'm Grampa !
MA: Thank God . Oh thank God . Tommy , you did n't *bust* out , didya ? You ai n't got to hide , have you ?
TOM: No , Ma . I 'm paroled . I got my papers .
MA: I was so scared we was goin ' away without youand we 'd never see each other again .
TOM: I 'd a found you , Ma .
MA: We *got* to , Tommy . But that 's gon na e awright . I seen the han'bills , about how much work they is , an ' high wages , too . But I got ta fin ' out somepin ' else first , Tommy . Did they hurt you , son ? Did they hurt you an ' make you mean-mad ?

TOM: I figger best we leave something like this on him , lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt . Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one .
PA: Not be so lonesome , either , knowin ' his name is there with 'im , not just ' a old fella lonesome underground .
TOM: Casy , wo n't you say a few words ?
CASY: I ai n't no more a preacher , you know .
TOM: We know . But ai n't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words .
CASY: I 'll say 'eman ' make it short . This here ol ' man jus ' lived a life an ' jus ' died out of it . I do n't know whether he was good or bad , an ' it do n't matter much . Heard a fella say a poem once , an ' he says , `` All that lives is holy . '' But I would n't pray for jus ' a ol ' man that 's dead , ecause he 's awright . If I was to pray I 'd pray for the folks that 's alive an ' do n't know which way to turn . Grampa here , he ai n't got no more trouble like that . He 's got his job all cut out for 'imso cove 'im up and let 'im get to it .

An ' maybe two-three thousan ' starts movin , wes ' account a this han'bill . Two- three thousan ' folks that 's crazy with worry headin ' out for 800 jobs ! Does that make sense ?
PROPRIETOR: What are you , a troublemaker ? You sure you ai n't one a them labor fakes ?

WINFIELD: Please do n't .
RUTHIE: I wo n't if you wo n't tell what *I* done !
TOM: If this do n't feel good !
WILKIE: Wait 'll about 'leven o'clock , see how good she feels then !
TOM: Seems like a nice frien'ly fella to work for , too .
TIM: Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas . Trouble is they 're little , they ai n't got much say-so .
TOM: Shore looks like my lucky day , anyway . Gettin ' some work at las ' .
THOMAS: Lissen here . Maybe I 'm talkin ' myself outa my farm , but I like you fellas , so I 'm gon na tell you . You live in that gov'ment camp , do n't you ?
TOM: Yes , sir .
THOMAS: And you have dances every Saturday night ?
WILKIE: We sure do .
THOMAS: Well , look out next Saturday night .
TIM: What you mean ? I belong to the central committee . I got to know .
THOMAS: Do n't you ever tell I told .
TIM: What is it ?
THOMAS: Well , the association do n't like the government camps . Ca n't get a deputy in there . Ca n't arrest a man without a warrant . But if there was a big fight , and maybe shootinga bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp . Like last night . Lissen . `` Citizens , angered at red agitators , burn anothe squatters ' camp , warn agitators to get out of the county . ''
TOM: Listen . What *is* these reds ? Ever'time you turn aroun ' somebody sayin ' somebody else 's a red . What is these reds , anyway ?
WILKIE: Well , I tell you . They was a fella up the country named Kinggot about 30,000 acres an ' a cannery an ' a wineryan ' he 's all a time talkin ' about reds . Drivin ' the country to uin , he says . Got to git rid of 'em , he says . Well , they was a young fella jus ' come out an ' he was listenin one day . He kinda scratched his head an ' he says , `` Mr. King , what *is* these reds you all a time talkin ' about ? '' Well , sir , Mr. King says , `` Young man , a red is any fella that wants thirty cents a hour when I 'm payin ' twenty-five . ''
THOMAS: I ai n't talkin ' about that one way or the other . All I 'm saying is that there 's going to be a fight in the camp Saturday night . And there 's going to be deputies ready to go in .
TOM: But why ? Those fellas ai n't botherin ' nobody .
THOMAS: I 'll tell you why . Those folks in to eing treated like humans . Suppose the Government closes its camps . Suppose too many people pass through 'em . Well , when those people go back to the squatters ' camps they 'll be hard to handle . Go on back to work now . Maybe I 've talked myself into trouble , but you 're folks like us , and I like you .
TIM: Nobody wo n't know who tol ' . We thank you . An ' they ai n't gon na be no fight , either . They shake hands .

WOMAN: You git right along ! This here girl 's spoke for . She 's gon na be married , an ' her man 's a-comin ' for her .
TOM: She 's gettin ' prettier , Ma .

AL: Well , you said anybody can waltz How 'm *I* doin ' ?
BLONDE GIRL: Do n't hold me so tight .
AL: Why , I ai n't hardly touchin ' you !

CARETAKER: Got a warrant ?
DRIVER: We do n't need a warrant if it 's a iot .
CARETAKER: Well , I do n't know what you gon na do about it , because I do n't hear no iot an ' I do n't see no riot , an ' what 's more I do n't believe they *is* no riot . Look for yourself .

MA: I could hide you , Tommy .
TOM: I know you would , Ma . But I ai n't gon na let you . You hide somebody that 's kilt a man an ' an ' you 'd e in trouble too .
MA: Awright , Tommy . What you figger you gon na do ?
TOM: You know what I been thinkin ' about , Ma ? About Casy . About what he said , what he done , an ' about how he died . An ' I remember all of it .
MA: He was a good man .
TOM: I been thinkin ' about us , tooabout our people livin ' like pigs , an ' good rich lan ' layin ' fallow , o maybe one fella with a million acres , while a hundred thousan ' farmers is starvin ' . An ' I been wonderin ' if all our folks got together an ' yelled
MA: Tommy , they 'll drive you , an ' cut you down like they done to Casy .
TOM: They gon na drive me anyways . Soon o later they 'll get me , for one thing if not another . Until then
MA: You do n't aim to kill nobody , Tom !
TOM: No , Ma . Not that . That ai n't it . But long as I 'm a outlaw , anyways , maybe I can do sump ' n . Maybe I can jus ' fin ' out sump ' n . Jus ' scrounge aroun ' an ' try to fin ' out what it is that 's wrong , an then see if they ai n't sump ' n could be done about it . But I ai n't thought it out clear , Ma . I ca n't . I do n't know enough .
MA: How 'm I gon na know 'bout you ? They might kill you an ' I would n't know . They might hurt you . How 'm I gon na know ?
TOM: Well , maybe it 's like Casy says , a fella ai n't got a soul of his own , ut on ' y a piece of a big soulthe one big soul that belongs to ever'body an ' then
MA: Then what , Tom ?
TOM: Then it do n't matter . Then I 'll be all aroun ' in the dark . I 'll be ever'wherewherever you look . Wherever there 's a fight so hungry people can eat , I 'll be there . Wherever there 's a cop beatin ' up a guy , I 'll be there . I 'll be in the way guys yell when they 're madan ' I 'll be in the way kids laugh when they 're hungry an ' they know supper 's eady . An ' when our people eat the stuff they raise , an ' live in the houses they build , why , I 'll be there too .
MA: I do n't understan ' it , Tom .
TOM: Me neither . It 's jus ' stuff I been thinkin ' about . Gim me you han ' , Ma . Good-by .

MA: Maybe . Maybe twenny days work , maybe *no* days work . We ai n't got it till we get it .
AL: Whatsa matter , Ma ? Gettin ' scared ?
MA: No . Ai n't ever gon na be scared no more . I was , though . For a while I thought we was beat*good* an ' beat . Looked like we did n't have nothin ' in the worl ' but enemieswas n't *no*body frien'ly anymore . It made me feel ad an ' scared toolike we was lost an ' nobody cared .
AL: Watch me pass that Chevvy .
PA: You the one that keeps us goin ' , Ma . I ai n't no good any more , an ' I know it . Seems like I spen ' all my time these days a-thinkin ' how it use'ta ethinkin ' of homean ' I ai n't never gon na see it no more .
MA: Woman can change better ' n a man . Man lives in jerksbaby born , or somebody dies , that 's a jerkgets a farm , o loses one , an ' that 's a jerk . With a woman it 's all one flow , like a stream , little eddies , little waterfalls , but the river it goes ight on . Woman looks at it like that .
AL: Look at that ol ' coffeepot steam !
PA: Maybe , but we shore takin ' a beatin ' .
MA: I know . Maybe that makes us tough . Rich fellas come up an ' they die , an ' their kids ai n't no good , an ' they die out . But we keep a-comin ' . We 're the people that live . Ca n't nobody wipe us out . Ca n't nobody lick us . We 'll go on forever , Pa. We 're the people .
CARD 3: LIFE HERE IS IMPOSSIBLE .
MISSION CONTROL: Explorer , please verify that the P1 ATA removal on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete .
EXPLORER CAP: DMA M1 , M2 , M3 and M4 are complete .
MISSION CONTROL: Copy that Explorer . Dr Stone-Houston , equesting status update
RYAN: Installation ninety-five percent complete . Running level one diagnostics on circuits , sensors , and power . Standby .
MISSION CONTROL: Standing by . Looks like we 're on schedule . Dr. Stone , Medical is concerned about your ECG readings .
RYAN: I 'm fine Houston .
MISSION CONTROL: Well , medical does n't agree doctor . Are you feeling nauseous ?
RYAN: Not any more than usual , Houston . Diagnostics are green . Linking to communications card . Ready for data eception . If this works , when we touch down tomorrow , I 'm buying all you guys a round of drinks .
MISSION CONTROL: That 's a date , doctor . Just remember , Houston is partial to Margaritas .
RYAN: OK , here we go Booting comm card now . Please confirm link .
BEAT: Houston , please confirm reception of data .
MISSION CONTROL: Negative . We 're not seeing any data .
RYAN: Stand by , Houston . I 'm gon na reboot the comm card .
MISSION CONTROL: Standing by .
ASTRONAUT: Houston , I have a bad feeling about this mission .
MISSION CONTROL: Please expand .
MATT: Okay , let me tell you a story . It was '96 . I 'd been up here 42 days . Every time I passed over Texas , I 'd look down , knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky , was looking up , thinking of me . Six weeks I 'm blowing kisses to that woman . Then we land at Edwards and I find out she 'd run off with a lawye efore I was off the launch pad , so I packed my car and I headed to
MISSION CONTROL: Tijuana . You 've told this story , Kowalsky . As Houston recalls , she took off in your '74 GTO . Engineering equests fuel status on the jet pack prototype .
MATT: Five hours off the reservation and I show 30 % drain . My compliments to Engineering . Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis , this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust .
MISSION CONTROL: Engineering says thank you .
MATT: Tell them I still prefer my '67 Corvette though . Speaking of which did I ever tell you the
MISSION CONTROL: We know the Corvette story , Matt .
MATT: Even Engineering ?
MISSION CONTROL: Especially engineering . We 're going to miss you , Matt .
RYAN: Comm card reboot in progress .
MISSION CONTROL: Thank you doctor . Shariff , what 's you status ?
SHARIFF: Nearly there . Replacing battery module A1 and C .
MISSION CONTROL: Could you be more specific ? Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious .
SHARIFF: No no no Houston , do n't be anxious . Anxiety is not good for the heart The system is ready to re- activate .
MISSION CONTROL: Hubble Telescope engaged . Upgrade fully functional . That applause you hear is for you , Shariff . Congratulations . Kick back , take the est of the day off .
SHARIFF: Woohoo Jaise Baadal Paani Ka , Yaarana Hai Oh Jaise Paani Ka , Yaarana Hai .
MISSION CONTROL: Matt , please advise as to Mission Specialist Shariff 's current activity .
MATT: He appears to be doing the Macarena of some sort . Though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part .
MISSION CONTROL: Dr. Stone . Houston . Medical now have you with a temperature drop to 35.9 and heart rate rise to 70 . How are you doing ?
RYAN: Houston , I 'm fine , it 's just
SHE SWALLOWS: Keeping your lunch down in zero G is harder than it looks .
MISSION CONTROL: Doctor Stone ? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer ? Ryan HUMS as she jiggles the CARD .
RYAN: No , we 've been here for a week Houston , let 's just finish this .
MISSION CONTROL: That 's a negative . I 'm afraid we 're getting nothing on this end , doctor . Ryan eyes the Card , then
RYAN: Try again .
MISSION CONTROL: Still nothing .
RYAN: Houston , could you please turn that music off ?
MISSION CONTROL: Kowalsky ?
MATT: Not a problem . Matt toggles a switch and the music stops .
RYAN: Thank you , Kowalsky . Ryan moves the Card around .
MISSION CONTROL: Negative .
RYAN: Could Houston be misinterpreting the data ?
MISSION CONTROL: We 're not receiving any data . Engineering is recommending a vis- check for component damage . Again , as if to herself-
RYAN: Mmmm . Let me see what 's going on . She starts to disengage one of the panels .
MUMBLES: What have you got here ?
MISSION CONTROL: That seems to be the case . Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen . That 's as close to an apology as you 're going to get from them . We should 've listened to you doc .
RYAN: I 'm on it .
MISSION CONTROL: Copy that . How long do you think it 'll take you ? Matt begins a wide loop around the telescope .
RYAN: An hour .
MISSION CONTROL: Outstanding . We appreciate you patience , Doctor . Installing you system in the Hubble is the main purpose of this mission .
MATT: Seventy-five minutes shy . Neve crossed my mind .
MISSION CONTROL: Matt , It 's been a privilege . Matt hesitates ever-so-briefly , then
MATT: Right back atcha , Houston .
MISSION CONTROL: Enjoy your last walk
MATT: Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in emoving the panel ?
RYAN: Assistance appreciated .
MISSION CONTROL: Permission granted .
MATT: Thank you , Houston .
TO RYAN: Mind if I join the fun ?
RYAN: Certainly .
MATT: How are you feeling ?
RYAN: Like a Chihuahua that 's being tumble dried .
MATT: It 's been a rough week . If it makes you feel any better , I puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ide .
RYAN: Whoa ! AWOL !
MATT: Hey you 're the genius up here . I just drive this bus .
RYAN: Call me a genius if I can get this oard initialized in the next hour .
MISSION CONTROL: Explorer , this is Houston .
EXPLORER CAP: Go ahead Houston .
MISSION CONTROL: NORAD reports a satellite has incurred a missile strike . The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour . Current debris orbit does not overlap with you trajectory . We 'll keep you posted on any developments . Ryan glances at Matt .
RYAN: Should we be worried ?
MATT: Let the boys down there worry for us .
RYAN: Explorer , engage arm and pivot to cargo bay .
EXPLORER CAP: Standby for arm maneuver .
MATT: So doc , now that you work for NASA , how do you like it ?
SHARIFF: Kinda like winning the lottery , is n't it ?
RYAN: I was just happy that they did n't cut the funding to my research .
MATT: How long was your training ?
RYAN: Six months .
SHARIFF: Including holidays ?
MATT: So , what is this scanning system ?
SHARIFF: Nothing rad , it 's just a new set of eyes to scan the universe .
RYAN: Assuming it works , it 's just fo hospital use . This one is a prototype .
EXPLORER CAP: Standby for marking .
MATT: Listen , they do n't bankroll prototypes , even for your pretty blue eyes . She gives him a look .
RYAN: My eyes are brown .
MATT: Right now your eyes are blood shut . She grins , looks away he got her . Then
SHARIFF: Kowalsky ! Matt turns . Shariff raises his arms again .
MATT: And to think he went to Harvard .
RYAN: Mm-hm .
MATT: `` Mmm ? '' So what do you like about being up here ?
RYAN: The silence .
BEAT: I could get used to it . Matt laughs softly .
MATT: Hmmmm . Terrific .
RYAN: Houston , from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead . Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary ?
MISSION CONTROL: You 're the expert , doctor . It 's you call .
MATT: Houston , I have a bad feeling about this mission .
MISSION CONTROL: Please elaborate .
MATT: It 's the same feeling I had at Mardi Gras in 1987 ?
MISSION CONTROL: That is affirmative . Surprisingly , control has n't heard the Mardi Gras story . Please proceed .
MATT: Well , it 's day one and I 'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking fo the sister of a friend of mine . The streets are swimming with people , I 'm thinking there 's no way I 'm finding this girl Ryan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself-
RYAN: Proceeding to over ride .
MATT: Then all of a sudden I look up and there she is .
MORE: MATT I am about to yell out when I notice she 's holding hands with a short hairy guy in board shorts and a Margaritaville T-shirt . Then I ealize , the guy 's no guy . My sister 's friend is holding hands with a Mission Control interrupts on the radio .
MISSION CONTROL: ISS , this is Houston .
ON RADIO: Zlotze Houston . Ryan inserts the plate into the Hubble .
MISSION CONTROL: Explorer , this is Houston .
EXPLORER CAP: Go ahead Houston .
MISSION CONTROL: Mission abort . Repeat mission abort . Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble .
ON RADIO: Begin re-entry procedure . Start Deorbit Prep for PLS at Kennedy . ISS , initiate emergency evacuation .
EXPLORER CAP: Copy all Houston , and in work . Matt , immediate return to Explorer . Repeat , immediate return to Explorer .
MATT: Roger . Explorer , prep airlock !
EXPLORER CAP: Airlock engagedready to receive . Ryan is working on the panel .
MATT: Houston . Elaborate .
MISSION CONTROL: Debris from the impact has caused a chain reaction , hitting othe satellites in its path and creating new debris . Norad reports that orbital and ballistic effects are driving the cloud of debris up toward you altitude . How copy ?
MATT: Copy all Houston .
TO RYAN: Put a bow on it Dr. Stone .
RYAN: I ca n't . If I turn it off now we 'll lose the whole system . She keeps on furiously tweaking .
MATT: I 'm not going to ask you again .
RYAN: ONE SECOND
MATT: Not one second . Now ! Shut it down !
RYAN: Sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's done .
EXPLORER CAP: Kowalsky , initiate emergency disconnect from the Hubble .
MATT: Alright Shariff , let 's do this .
SHARIFF: Roger .
MATT: Houston . Update .
MISSION CONTROL: We have a full on chain reaction . It 's een confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own satellites . Shariff arrives to the base of the telescope .
SHARIFF: They shot down their own satellite ?
MATT: Right of disposal . Most likely a spy sat gone bad . Now it 's space junk . Matt grabs onto the base of the telescope-
EXPLORER CAP: Locks releasing in three two one
MISSION CONTROL: Explorer , new data coming through .
MATT: What 's the blowback , Houston ?
MISSION CONTROL: It 's not good . Most of our systems are going down . Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding . Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling .
MATT: Define `` multiple '' sats .
MISSION CONTROL: Most of them . Telecomunications systems are gone . Expect a communication blackout at any moment .
RYAN: Kowalsky , visual of debris at nine o'clock .
MATT: Half of North America just lost thei Facebook . The sat glides by at tremendous speed .
MISSION CONTROL: You 're a go for TH1138 . Repeat You 're a go for TH1138 procedure .
EXPLORER CAP: Copy that Houston .
MATT: Explorer , this is Kowalsky . Confirming visual contact with debris . Debris is from a BSE sat . To repeat
SHARIFF: Heads up !
MATT: To repeat I have-
RYAN: Dr. Stone requesting faster , faste transport .
MATT: We have to go . Go , go ! Go !
MISSION CONTROL: Attention . New data suggests immediate evacuation absolu A high frequency of interference and-
RYAN: Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area . Explorer get me down .
MATT: Explorer permission to retrieve Dr. Stone .
EXPLORER CAP: You are a go , Kowalsky . Matt thrusts himself over to Ryan .
ON RADIO: Houston , this is Explorer . Copy ? But there 's no answer .
MATT: Unstrap ! You ca n't tune out the world up here .
RYAN: I 'm trying
MATT: Try releasing the safety clip .
SHARIFF: Need some help there Matt ?
MATT: No , do n't wait for us . Get inside .
RYAN: It 's stuck !
MATT: Man down ! Man down !
TO RYAN: Disengage ! ! !
ON RADIO: Dr. Stone , detach !
RYAN: Nooooo !
MATT: You must detach !
RYAN: No .
MATT: If you do n't detach that arm is going to carry you too far !
RYAN: I ca n't !
MATT: Listen to my voice . You need to focus . I 'm losing visual of you . In a few seconds I wo n't be able to track you .
RYAN: Ok. Ok .
MATT: You need to detach . I ca n't see you anymore .
RYAN: I 'm trying . I 'm trying .
MATT: Do it . Now !
RYAN: Ok . I 'm trying ! I ca n't it 's stuck , Hold on .
MATT: Houston , I 've lost visual of Dr. Stone Houston , I 've lost visual of Dr. Stone .
RYAN: Yes . Yes . I copy . I 'm detached !
MATT: Give me your position !
RYAN: I do n't know . I do n't know ! I 'm spinning . I ca n't . I ca n't .
MATT: Report your position .
RYAN: GPS isdown . I ca n't , it 's down , I ca n't .
MATT: Give me a visual .
RYAN: I told you ! Nothing . I see nothing !
MATT: Do you have a visual of Explorer ?
RYAN: NO
MATT: Do you have a visual of ISS ?
RYAN: NO
MATT: I need you to focus . Give me a visual anything .
RYAN: It 's too fast .
MATT: Stone . Do you copy ?
RYAN: Lieutenant Kowalsky ? The flickering star begins to thicken
MATT: Repeat . Do you copy ?
RYAN: YES ! YES ! I copy ! I 'm here !
MATT: Flash your light .
RYAN: My light ?
MATT: So I can see you .
RYAN: Here ! Here !
MATT: There you are . Hang tight . Report your status .
RYAN: I 'm I 'm alright I 'm fine .
MATT: Your status ! Give me your readings ?
RYAN: 3.6 psi , I think .
MATT: Your O2 . Give me your O2 .
RYAN: Steady at eight percentno seven
MATT: You 're breathing too fast . You 're urning oxygen . We do n't want to do that . We want to relax . Copy .
RYAN: Copy .
MATT: Nearly there .
RYAN: Please hurry .
MATT: You can holster that torch , Dr. Stone .
RYAN: Oh . Sorry .
MATT: Gotcha .
RYAN: Arghh !
MATT: Now , I 'm going to tether you to me .
RYAN: Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , Ohh I got it .
MATT: Ok . So far so good . Now listen . I 'm going to give you a little push , just so you 're clear of the jets
RYAN: NO
MATT: Sorry . Not a push , more like a nudge .
RYAN: No No No Wait Do n't .
MATT: See ? Where you go , I go .
RYAN: Ahh Dammit !
MATT: I know what you mean .
RYAN: Ahhh Dammit .
MATT: You 're burning oxygen , we 're going to go back to the shuttle . How 's that fo a plan . Copy ?
RYAN: FUCK
MATT: Right copy that .
RYAN: Why are n't they answering ?
MATT: It seems like communications are lost .
RYAN: Can they hear us on an alternate frequency ?
MATT: We do n't know . That 's why we keep talking . If someone is listening they might just save your life . Set you watch for ninety minutes .
RYAN: Why ninety ?
MATT: Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour . Factoring in our current orbit , I reckon we 've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again .
RYAN: 02 down to six percent .

NICK: I 'm not married .
WOLFSHEIM: But you work on Wall Street , right ?
TOTALLY CONFUSED: Yes
WOLFSHEIM: Looking at my tiepin ? CLOSE ON The pin .
GATSBY: Gentlemen . Everything alright ?
NICK: Oh , yes We were just talking about other people 's wives
GATSBY: Other people 's wives ? Ah I see . Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim .
WOLFSHEIM: Well , my work here is done . I 'll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women
GATSBY: You 'll have to excuse him In his old age , he 's prone to `` digress '' He 's a regular around here ; a real denizen of Broadway
NICK: Who is he anyhow ?
GATSBY: Meyer ? He 's a gambler .
NICK: An actor ?
GATSBY: Meyer ? No . He 's the man who fixed the 1919 World Series .
NICK: Fixed it ?
GATSBY: Fixed it .
NICK: How did he manage that ?
GATSBY: He just saw the opportunity , I suppose . He 's a very smart man . Now , old sport , about Miss Baker , and that request we spoke of
TOM: Hey Nick ! Nick ! Where 've you been ! ? Daisy 's furious you have n't called up . Nick and Gatsby stand .
NICK: This is Mr. Gatsby , Mr. Buchanan .
GATSBY: I 'm so very , very delighted to make your acquaintance . Tom turns back to Nick .
TOM: I would n't have expected to find you in this temple of virtue .
NICK: I 'm having lunch with Mr. Gats Nick turns , but inexplicably , Gatsby is gone .
MAITRE'D: Will the gentleman be joining ?
FRUSTRATED: One moment please
JORDAN: Please , Nick , sit down . This is a polite restaurant .
NICK: It 's all very strange . He picks me up in his fancy yellow car And he 's going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and What is
JORDAN: If you 'll just have a seat
NICK: What is this big request ! ?
JORDAN: Nick ! He just wants you to invite Daisy to tea .
NICK: Tea ? Daisy ? And Gatsby ? Nick sits
JORDAN: Well I do n't know quite where to start . You see I met Gatsby , five years ago , in Louisville
BLOWN AWAY: So what happened ?
JORDAN: Well , I do n't know
SCREAMS: Tell them Daisy 's changed her mind !
JORDAN: Daisy ! Please , everyone 's waiting !
YOUNG DAISY: Give them back ! !
DAISY'S MOTHER: What on earth is going on in here ! ?
DAISY: Leave me alone !
DAISY'S MOTHER: Jordan , run the bath ! Now !
JORDAN: After the honeymoon , I saw them in Santa Barbara . It was touching , actually
MUSES CYNICALLY: A week later , Tom crashed his car . The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel . It got into all the papers
NICK: It 's a strange coincidence , is n't it ? Gatsby 's house being just across the bay Jordan whirls round
JORDAN: It 's no coincidence . He bought that house to be near her , he threw all those parties hoping she 'd wande in one night . He constantly asked about Daisy I was the first one who knew her .
NICK: All that for a girl he has n't seen in five years ? And now he just wants me to have her for tea ?
TO HIMSELF: The modesty of it .
JORDAN: Kind of takes your breath away , does n't it ? A cab pulls up , and Nick opens the door
TAXI DRIVER: Evening sweethearts ! Where to ?
JORDAN: Long Island , please .
NICK: And you think I should ? I mean , does Daisy want to see Gatsby ?
JORDAN: She 's absolutely not to know . You are just supposed to invite he over so he can `` happen to drop by . '' CLOSE ON Nick , unsure
NICK: Your place looks like the World 's Fair or Coney Island !
TERRIBLY ANXIOUS: Ah , does it ? I 've I 've just been glancing into some rooms Let 's go to Coney Island , old sport , we can take my car
NICK: It 's too late tonight .
GATSBY: Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool ? I have n't made use of it all summer
NICK: I must go to bed
GATSBY: Oh , that 's alright . I do n't want to put you to any trouble
NICK: What day would suit you ?
GATSBY: What day would suit you ? I do n't want to put you to any trouble
NICK: Day after tomorrow alright ?
GATSBY: Day after tomorrow ? Well , I 'd I 'd want to get the grass cut .
NICK: Not really .
GATSBY: If you 'll pardon my You see , I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I 'm saying right ? You 're selling bonds , are n't you , old sport ?
NICK: Trying to .
GATSBY: Well , this might interest you It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing But you might pick up a nice bit of money .
NICK: I 've got my hands full . Gatsby 's face falls .
GATSBY: You would n't have to do any usiness with Wolfsheim . I assure you .
NICK: No , no , no Its a favor Jay . Just a favor .
GATSBY: A favor ?
NICK: Yes .
GATSBY: Ah , right , right Goodnight .
NICK: Goodnight .
GATSBY: One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four . I think it was the Journal An awkward beat .
NICK: The grass looks fine .
GATSBY: Grass ?
NICK: Perhaps more flowers ?
GATSBY: I think they did a fine job , do n't you ?
NICK: Beautiful .
GATSBY: You think it 's too much ?
NICK: I think it 's what you want .
GATSBY: I think so too She 'll be impressed , wo n't she old sport ?
NICK: I am .
GATSBY: I ca n't wait all day . I 'm leaving !
NICK: Do n't be silly . It 's just two minutes to four But Gatsby heads for the door
GATSBY: Nobody 's coming to tea . It 's too late !
NICK: It 's her . PUSH IN ON GATSBY Mind racing
DAISY: Is this absolutely where you live , my dearest one ? She looks at him with a mysterious smile .
NICK: That 's the secret of Carraway Castle .
PLAYING ALONG: Tell your chauffeur to go far away .
DAISY: Come back in an hour , Ferdie !
GRAVE MURMUR: His name is Ferdie .
TO HERSELF: He is in love with me
NICK: That 's funny .
DAISY: What 's funny ? KNOCK . KNOCK . Someone is at the door .
NICK: One moment
DAISY: I 'm certainly glad to see you again .
GATSBY: I 'm certainly glad to see you as well .
GATSBY: We 've met before
IDIOTICALLY: It 's an old clock .
DAISY: Lovely though . A lovely clock .
GATSBY: Five years next November .
ABRUPTLY: Tea ?
DYING: Thank you old sport .
ALSO MORTIFIED: Darling thank you .
NICK: I just need to pop into town .
HORRIFIED: Town ?
NICK: The village ; I 'll be right back . As Nick leaves , Gatsby follows .
GATSBY: I 've got to speak to you !
NICK: You 're just embarrassed , that 's all Daisy 's embarrassed too .
GATSBY: She 's embarrassed ?
NICK: Just as much as you are .
GATSBY: Do n't talk so loud !
NICK: You 're acting like a little boy ! You 're rude . Daisy 's in there all alone and
GATSBY: Yes , it has
TO DAISY: Has n't it ?
DAISY: Look . Its my house . Just there across the bay Gatsby and Daisy 's eyes meet .
GATSBY: I know . I have the same view from my place .
DAISY: Where 's your place ? Gatsby turns back to Nick .
GATSBY: Nick , I want you and Daisy both to see my house . I 'd like to show he around .
NICK: Are you sure you want me to come ?
GATSBY: Absolutely , old sport . Absolutely .
PROUDLY: I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy .
DAISY: Oh , Jay ! ? Its so grand !
GATSBY: Do you like it ?
DAISY: I love it ! But how do you live here all alone ?
GATSBY: I do n't . I keep it always full of interesting , celebrated people As Daisy runs ahead , Gatsby murmurs to Nick .
DAUSY: Come on you two ! I want the royal tour !
GATBSY: You must understand , I like all things that are modern .
GATSBY: If you press this button here , the oranges shoot through here , are crushed there The juice of 200 oranges extracted in one hour !
DAISY: You do know , I 'm a champion golfer , do n't you ? Here , I 'll show you how its done .
GATSBY: She looks like she could be on the cover of Vogue , do n't you think ?
DAISY: Oh ! Its beautiful .
GATSBY: Its a custom Wurlitzer .
DAISY: Can anyone play it ?
GATSBY: Klipspringer can . Someone wake Ewing ! Daisy twirls round , overjoyed
DAISY: Music ! And we can dance all night !
GATSBY: Ewing 's a symphonic genius , he can play anything ! Daisy runs up the stairs and calls down
DAISY: Then I demand a Charleston !
GATSBY: She makes it look so splendid , do n't you think old sport ?
DAISY: I 've never seen anything like it !
GATSBY: He sends over a selection at the eginning of each season
DAISY: Jay ! With ever-increasing enthusiasm !
GATSBY: These are silk ! Linen ! Indian flannel ! Egyptian cotton !
DAISY: No , Jay you 'll ruin them !
TO NICK: Nicky ! He 's a madman ! More and more and more shirts float down The rumble of distant thunder .
GATSBY: What is it ?
DAISY: It 's just It makes me sad , ecause Daisy glances in Nick 's direction
GATSBY: Why ?
DAISY: because
GATSBY: If it was n't for the mist we could see the green light
DAISY: What green light ?
GATSBY: The one that burns all night at the end of your dock .
NICK: Who 's this ? Your father ?
GATSBY: No , no.. That 's Mr. Dan Cody , old sport He 's dead now . He used to e my best friend years ago .
TEASES: You never told me you had a pompadour or a yacht .
GATSBY: I want to show you something Look , here 's a lot of clippings , about you . They admire a scrapbook together .
TOUCHED: You saved my letters
GATSBY: This was my first photo of you .
FRIGHTENING: Well , he 's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town
WHISPERS: I wish I had done everything on earth with you . All my life . Gatsby holds her closer .
GATSBY: It will be
NICK: You see doctor Gatsby 's real name was James Gatz .
CODY: Whadzamatta ?
YOUNG GATSBY: Sir ! The shoal here 's real bad , this wind could drag you onto it Cody waves a dismissive arm
CODY: Whaderathinkyerdoin , old sport ? He collapses , dead drunk . PUSH IN On Young Gatsby ; a plan forming
YOUNG GATSBY: Gatsby . Jay Gatsby . A pleasure to meet you , sir . Gatsby . Jay Gatsby . Gatsby . Jay Gatsby .
GATSBY: We 've got a great band here . Have a look around Excuse me He turns briefly to talk to Senator Gulick
TOM: A lot of these newly rich people are just filthy bootleggers .
DAISY: Not Gatsby . He 's a businessman .
SNORTS: Hah ! A businessman
DAISY: He owned a lot of drug stores .
GATSBY: May I introduce Senator Gulick ? This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs. Buchanan
DAISY: Delighted
GATSBY: And Mr. Buchanan The polo player .
OBJECTING QUICKLY: Oh no . Not me .
SENATOR GULICK: Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan .
TOM: I 'd rather not be the polo player .
DAISY: Oh Tom You should be proud of your achievements .
GATSBY: May I show you around ? He guides them down the stairs
DAISY: Absolutely !
SCOFFS: We do n't go around very much . I do n't think I recognize a single person
GATSBY: Perhaps you know that lady there ?
DAISY: Its Marlene Moon I adore he pictures
TOM: I 'd really rather not be the polo player
TO NICK: These things excite me so Gatsby turns to Tom
GATSBY: I believe we 've met somewhere efore , Mr. Buchanan . About a month ago .
TOM: That 's right And you were with Nick here . At the barbershop
GATSBY: That 's right . See I know you wife .
TOM: Is that so ?
GATSBY: Yes .
HERZOG: Mr. Gatsby sir . Mr. Slagle is here
GATSBY: Not now . Herzog silently recedes
TRIMALCHIO: And now ! Dice , Brass Knuckles and Guitars , with The Foxtrot ! Gatsby turns to Tom , and gestures to Daisy
GATSBY: Mr. Buchanan , would you mind , terribly ?
TOM: Of course not ; I think I can keep myself amused .
DAISY: In case you need to take down any addresses
GATSBY: No You see you were there all along , in every idea , in every decision Of course , if anything is not to your liking , we can change it
DAISY: It 's perfect . From your perfect , irresistible imagination
TOM: I wonder where the devil he met Daisy ?
TO NICK: I 'll find you
TOM: Have you seen my wife ? Startled , Nick turns
LIES: Ah no Not for awhile .
TOM: That 's funny . The Senator said he saw her down here .
DAISY: I I wish we could just run away .
GATSBY: Run away ? Darling , no . Daisy , that that would n't be espectable .
QUIZZICALLY: You live near here Nick ?
NICK: Just next door .
TOM: That so ?
GATSBY: We 're going to live here , in this house , together . You and me Daisy It 's time for you to tell Tom .
PURE DISDAIN: What a circus Well , if you see her , I 'll be looking for her . You tell her .
DAISY: Remember how much fun we used to have ? Why ca n't we just have fun like that again ? Gatsby , frustrated , is about to speak
NICK: What about ? Daisy glides toward him
DAISY: About things About the future The future of the Colored Empires .
NICK: Well , its Tom . He 's wandering around the party looking for you .
HERZOG: Sir ; it 's Mr. Slagle ; he 's quite emotional .
GATSBY: Excuse me . Nick , would you mind ?
NICK: But Gatsby was unable to return .
WOLFSHEIM: When these hot headed types appear , I rely on you But you were not available.. A scene was made What 's going on with you Jay ?
TOM: Where were you ?
DAISY: With Nicky . Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds .
TOM: Well , he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together
NICK: Well there you are ! Daisy just left But she asked me to tell you . She had a wonderful time Gatsby is not amused .
GATSBY: She did n't like it .
NICK: Of course she did .
GATSBY: No , she did n't like it . She did not have a good time . I feel so fa away from her now . It 's hard to make her understand .
NICK: You mean about the party ?
GATSBY: The party ! ? I could n't care less about the parties ! You see
NICK: What ?
GATSBY: Yes . Then we can go back to Louisville , to her parents ' house - her parents are lovely people old sport - we 'll be married there You see , Daisy and I are going to and start over , just as if it were five years ago .
NICK: I would n't ask too much of her
GATSBY: Ask too much ?
NICK: No .
GATSBY: I beg your pardon old sport . Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand , and
NICK: Jay You ca n't repeat the past . Gatsby wheels around
GATSBY: Ca n't repeat the past ?
NICK: No .
GATSBY: Why of course you can . Of course you can . You 'll see . I am going to fix things just the way there were efore . Everything 's been so so confused since then Gatsby looks out to the green light .
DAISY MOM: Daisy , do n't scamper .
WHISPERS: There 's so many dashing young officers here , and from such illustrious family 's CLOSE ON Gatbsy , watching Daisy
GATSBY: I knew that , that when I kissed this girl , I would be foreve wed to her
DAISY: I do n't want to go home . Gatsby hold her tighter .
GATSBY: Then do n't .
CLARIFIES: They 're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for .
EXCITED: Nick Daisy 's ready . Shes ready . But there 's just one thing . She 's equested that you and Miss Bake e there , at lunch tomorrow , at he house Will you come , old sport ?
AN ADMISSION: Daisy needs you . I We need you . Will you come old sport ?
TOM: You know , I read somewhere that the sun 's getting hotter every year
GATSBY: I 'm right across from you .
UNIMPRESSED: So you are . Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy .
GATSBY: Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock , blinking .
TOM: What light ? Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy 's
GATSBY: You see , Mr. Buchanan , I wanted to e close Daisy and I With sudden intensity Daisy stands !
DAISY: It 's so hot Agitated , she sweeps toward the sideboard .
TURNS SUDDENLY: Let 's all go to town ! Who wants to go to town ?
TOM: Town ! ? Women They get these notions
WHISPERS: Daisy
DAISY: You look so cool . You always look so cool , like the advertisement of the man in Times Square CLOSE ON Tom , his jaw tightening .
TOM: Let 's go to town ! I 'm perfectly willing ! That 's a marvelous idea ! Henri ! Have the car brought around immediately !
DAISY: Just like that ? Ca n't anyone at least have a cigarette ?
TOM: We 've smoked all through lunch .
DAISY: Oh , let 's have fun . It 's too hot to fuss .
TOM: It was your great idea Daisy . Why do n't we ! ? We 'll all go to town ! Daisy does n't budge .
DAISY: I 've changed my mind
TEASES: You brute .
TOM: You 've got me all excited , and now you do n't want to go ? We 'll get a great big room at the Plaza , a cold ucket of ice , and some whiskey It will be fun .
DAISY: Fine . Have it your own way , Tom Come on , Jordan .
TOM: Will you join us , Mr. Gatsby ? Then turns and calls to Henri
GATSBY: I do n't think there 's much gas , old sport . Gatsby looks to Daisy , a burning stare .
TOM: Plenty of gas . And if we run out , then we 'll stop at a drug store . I hear you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays Is n't that right , Mr. Gatsby ?
DAISY: You take Nick and Jordan , Tom ! She slips quickly into the coupé
TOM: You think I 'm pretty dumb , do n't you ? But I have a an almost second sight , sometimes , that tells me what to do . And I 've made a small investigation of this fellow .
CONDESCENDING: And you found he was an Oxford man ?
TOM: Oxford , New Mexico ! He wears a pink suit for Christ 's sake !
MOCKING: We 're almost out of gas Tom
TOM: Wilson ! Wilson ! What are you waiting for ! ? Let 's have some gas
GETS OUT: Do I have to do it myself ?
WILSON: I 'm sick . I 'm all run down . I need money bad My wife and I want to go West .
TOM: Your wife does ?
WILSON: I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days . She 's goin ' whether she wants to or not .
TOM: What do I owe you ! ?
WILSON: Dollar twenty .
TOM: You can have the car ! I 'll send it around tomorrow !
DAISY: Open another window .
NICK: There are n't any more .
DAISY: Then telephone for an axe
TOM: Forget about the heat . You make it worse by crabbing about it .
GATSBY: Why not let her alone , old sport ?
TOM: That 's a great expression of yours , is n't it ?
GATSBY: What is ? Tom turns to Gatsby
TOM: 'Old sport ' . Where 'd you pick it up ?
DAISY: Now see here , Tom ; if you 're going to make personal remarks I wo n't stay here one minute .
TOM: Mr. Gatsby , I understand you 're an Oxford man .
GATSBY: No , not exactly .
TOM: Oh yes , I understand you went to Oxford .
GATSBY: Yes - I went there . Tom 's laugh is incredulous and insulting .
TOM: Sure ; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford !
DAISY: Tom ! Gatsby stands .
GATSBY: I told you I went there .
TOM: I heard you , but I 'd like to know when .
GATSBY: You 'd like to know when. ? It was in nineteen-nineteen , I only stayed five months . That 's why I ca n't exactly call myself an Oxford man .
DAISY: I 'll make you a drink Tom , then you wo n't seem so stupid to yourself But Tom 's not done yet .
TOM: Wait a minute , I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question .
GATSBY: Go on . Please Mr. Buchanan , go on .
TOM: What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow ?
DAISY: He is n't causing a row ; you 're causing a row . Please have a little self-control !
TOM: Self-control ! I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife ? Well , if that 's the idea you can count me out See , nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next you know they 'll throw everything overboard and we 'll have intermarriage etween black and white !
JORDAN: We 're all white here , Tom .
GATSBY: Your wife does n't love you . She 's never loved you . She loves me !
TOM: You must be crazy .
GATSBY: No , old sport . See , she never loved you She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting . It was a terrible , terrible mistake , but in her heart she never loved anyone but me !
JORDAN: We should go
GATSBY: Daisy and I have nothing to hide
DAISY: Jay let 's go , please !
TOM: Sit down Daisy !
REASSURING: Yes , Daisy , please sit down .
TOM: What 's been going on ? I want to hear all about it .
GATSBY: I just told you what 's been going on ; its been going on for five years ! Tom turns to Daisy sharply .
TOM: You 've been seeing him for five years ?
GATSBY: Not seeing . No , we could n't ; but oth of us loved each other all that time , old sport , and you did n't know . I used to laugh sometimes , to think that you did n't know
TOM: Oh - that 's all ; you 're crazy ! I ca n't speak about what happened five years ago , because I did n't know Daisy then - but I 'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door . But all the rest of that 's a god-damned lie . Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now . Tom starts to make himself a drink
GATSBY: No
TOM: She does , though And what 's more , I love Daisy too . Once in a while I go off on a spree , but I always come back , and in my heart I love her all the time
DAISY: You 're revolting
GATSBY: That 's all over now . Just tell him the truth , that you never loved him ; and all this all this pain will be wiped out forever . Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly .
DAISY: Why , how could I love him , possibly ?
GATSBY: You never loved him .
DAISY: I never loved him .
GATSBY: That 's right
TOM: Not at Kapiolani ?
DAISY: No .
TOM: Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep you shoes dry ? Daisy ? Never ?
DAISY: Please do n't .
TOM: Daisy Her voice is cold , but the anger is gone .
DAISY: There , Jay . She trembles as she looks to Gatsby
GATSBY: You loved me too ?
SAVAGE: Even that 's a lie . She did n't know you were alive . There are things etween Daisy and me that you 'll never know , things that neither of us can ever forget .
GATSBY: I want to speak to Daisy alone . She 's all excited now
DAISY: Even alone I ca n't say I neve loved Tom . It would n't be true .
TOM: Of course it would n't . Daisy turns to her husband .
DAISY: As if it mattered to you .
TOM: Of course it matters . I 'm going to take better care of you from now on .
GATSBY: You 're not taking care of her any more ! Daisy 's leaving you .
TOM: Nonsense .
DAISY: I am , though .
TOM: She 's not leaving me ; and certainly not for a common swindler ! Tom 's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby .
GATSBY: What about it , old sport ?
TOM: Do n't call me ` old sport ! ' This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now .
GATSBY: Well your friend Walter Chase is n't too proud to come in on it .
TOM: I 've been giving that some thought . How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim ?
GATSBY: It 's called ` greed , ' old sport .
TOM: That 's right ; you 've got half of Wall Street out there swilling you free booze at that fun park every weekend
TO NICK: I 'm surprised he has n't tried to drag you in Nick looks away sharply . Tom registers this .
GATSBY: He 's got nothing to do with
TOM: With your little racket
TO DAISY: Daisy Ca n't you see who this guy is ? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes ; he 's just a front for Wolfsheim , a gangster , to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter !
GATSBY: The only respectable thing about you , old sport , is your money , that 's it , and now I 've just as much as you ; so that means we 're equal ! ! Tom smiles with smug , condescending scorn .
TOM: Oh no , no , we 're different ; I am , ( gesturing at Nick and
JORDAN: They are
TOM: That 's right Mr. Gatsby , show us those fine Oxford manners
DAISY: My sincerest apologies . I I seem to have lost my temper .
GATSBY: Daisy darling None of this has any consequence . Do n't listen to him Daisy .
DAISY: Please Tom ; I ca n't stand this anymore !
TOM: You two start on home
TO GATSBY: In Mr. Gatsby 's car . Daisy is alarmed now .
GATSBY: Daisy !
TOM: Want any of this ? Jordan ? Nick ? Nick ?
NICK: What ?
TOM: Want any ?
NICK: No I just remembered - today 's my birthday . I 'm thirty . Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink
TOM: Happy birthday
WILSON: God knows everything you 've been doing !
MYRTLE: He 's here
GATSBY: No ! BUT the car STRIKES Myrtle !
TOM: Wreck ! Good . Wilson will have a little business at last Let 's take a look..
JORDAN: Must we ?
TOM: Just a look .
WILSON: O , my Ga-od ! O , my Ga-od !
TO TOM: Sir . Sir , I 'm gon na have to ask you to step away
TOM: Get off me ! I 'm fine . I 'm fine .
POLICEMAN: You knew her ?
TOM: No Not really
POLICEMAN: Well then I have to ask you to step ack .
TOM: What happened ?
POLICEMAN: She ran out ` inna road . Son-of-a- itch did n't even stopus car .
MICHAELIS: Yeah , a big yellow duezy ; custom job .
WILSON: You do n't have to tell me what kind of car it was ! I know what kind of car it was !
TOM: Pull yourself together
POLICEMAN: What color 's your car ?
TOM: Blue , a coupé ; we 've come straight from New York .
MICHAELIS: Yeah , they just stopped
POLICEMAN: Alright Blue .
WILSON: Who owns the yella ' car ?
TOM: Fella named Gatsby ; he 's a crook , George . Gives those parties the papers are always talking about
WILSON: Maybe he was the one foolin ' with Myrtle ; maybe that 's why he killed her ?
TOM: Yeah . Maybe . Guy like that , who knows Wilson starts sobbing again .
WILSON: Oh , Ga-od ! Oh , my Ga-od ! He rests his head on Tom 's shoulder Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers
TOM: Gatsby . Something outta be done about a fella like that . He 'll pay Oh , he 'll pay
NICK: No thanks . I 'll wait outside . Tom stares at Nick , absorbing his disdain .
TOM: What is the matter with you ?
JORDAN: Wo n't you come in , Nick ?
NICK: No thanks .
JORDAN: It 's only half past nine
NICK: No . I think I 've had enough Of everyone .
GATSBY: Hello old sport
NICK: What are you doing ! ?
GATSBY: Just sitting here
NICK: Yes , I can see that .
GATSBY: Did you see any trouble out on the oad ?
NICK: Trouble ! ? That woman you ran down is dead Jay !
GATSBY: I thought so I told Daisy I
NICK: Daisy ? Do you hear yourself
GATSBY: Its better that the shock should come all at once
NICK: What 's wrong with you ! ? How could you ! ?
GATSBY: Please Keep your voice down , old sport .
NICK: Tom was right ! You 're nothing but a goddamn coward !
THREATENING: Keep your voice down There . Was . No . Point . In . Stopping .
NICK: NO POINT ! ?
GATSBY: It , it killed her instantly . I
NICK: Yes , I was there . I saw ! It ripped her open !
GATSBY: I understand It was my fault . This woman just rushed out , as if she wanted to speak to us It all happened so quickly . She I tried to turn the wheel .
NICK: She ?

PAUL: Oh , my Reverse angle
BRAD: Out for a little stroll , Paulie ?
PAUL: Let go
BRAD: What 's with this poncho you got on , huh ? This is n't yours .
PAUL: I got it off the wall there . There 's a whole row of them .
BRAD: But not for you , Paulie , that 's the thing . Those are for the staff .
PAUL: I just borrowed it . Do n't see what harm it does .
BRAD: It 's not about harm , it 's about ules . You probably do n't think an old fart like you has to mind ules anymore , but that 's just not true .
PAUL: I 'm sorry if I broke the rules .
BRAD: You got no business up in those woods anyway , especially in the ain . What if you fall and bust a hip , huh ? Who you think 's gon na have to hoss your sorry old bacon ack down here ? Me , that 's who .
PAUL: You 're hurting me !

PAUL: Nothing . I just walk , that 's all , I like to walk !
BRAD: Come on . Open up . Let Poppa see .
ELAINE: I saw you coming back , thought you 'd like some tea . Are you coming in ?
PAUL: Mr. Dolan and I werechatting . About the weather . I think we 're through now . Brad lets Paul loose , leans close
BRAD: Paulie ? You tell anyone I squeezed your po ' ol ' hand , I 'll tell 'em you 're having senile delusions . Who you think they 'll believe ?
PETE: Why we always watch this crap ?
ELAINE: We should report him .
PAUL: That might just provoke him all the more , make things worse fo everybody .
ELAINE: It 's not everybody he has it in for , Paul . It 's you . What did you do to provoke him in the first place ? Nothing . He 's just an abusive bully , and should e made to stop .
PAUL: Ellie , please Pete is at the TV , switching channels while
ELDERLY LADIES: no , the Movie Classic channel is further downpast the Home Shoppingkeep going
FRED ASTAIRE: Heaven , I 'm in heavenand my heart beat so that I can hardly speak

ORDERLY: What is it ? What 's wrong ?
PAUL: It 's okayI 'll be okay
BRAD: S'matter , Paulie ? Why the boo-hoo- hoo ? Something nasty happen ?
ELAINE: Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly fine without your help , thank you .
PAUL: I guess sometimes the past just catches up with you , whether you want it to or not . It 's silly .
ELAINE: Was it the film ? It was , was n't it ?
PAUL: I have n't spoken of these things in a long time , Ellie . Over sixty years . She reaches out , gently takes his hand .
ELAINE: Paul . I 'm your friend .
PAUL: Yes . Yes you are .
ELAINE: You 've mentioned it .
PAUL: Did I mention I was in charge of death row ? That I supervised all the executions ?
BRUTAL: Paul ? Prisoner .
PAUL: With a new arrival ? You know etter . Besides , it 's not as bad as it was . I think it 's clearing up .
DEL: New boy coming in , boss ?
PAUL: Never you mind , Del , you just keep your nose quietly on your business .
BRUTAL: Damn , they 're riding on the axle . What 'd they do , bust the springs ?
PAUL: Why 's that ?
BRUTAL: He 's enormous .
PAUL: Ca n't be bigger than you .
PERCY: Dead man walking ! Dead man walking here ! Inside the cellblock
PAUL: Jeezus , pleeze-us , what the hell 's he yelling about ?
PERCY: Dead man walking !
PAUL: Percy , that 's enough .
BRUTAL: You sure you wan na be in there with him ?
PAUL: Am I gon na have trouble with you , ig boy ?
PERCY: They got all the men they need .
PAUL: Why do n't you just go make sure ? I do n't care where you go , Percy , as long as it 's not here at this very moment .
PERCY: Wiped that grin off your shitpoke face , did n't I
PAUL: Goddamn it , Percy ! Get the hell off my block !
DEL: Oww , damn , boss , he done bus ' my fingers for true
PAUL: We 'll get it looked at , Del , now keep yourself quiet like I said !
COFFEY: Yes , sir , boss , like the drink , only not spelt the same .
PAUL: So you can spell , can you ? Coffey shakes his head . Harry steps out .
COFFEY: It were n't me making all the noise , boss .
PAUL: You having a joke on me , John Coffey ?
COFFEY: No , sir . Paul sees he is n't joking , continues
PAUL: Your time here can be easy o hard , depends on you . If you ehave , you get to walk in the exercise yard every day . We might even play some music on the radio from time to time . Questions ?
COFFEY: Do you leave a light on afte edtime ?
PAUL: It 's pretty bright in here all night long . We keep half the lights burning in the corridor .
COFFEY: Cor'der .
PAUL: Right out there .
COFFEY: Could n't help it , boss . I tried to take it back , but it was too late . Paul turns , leads his men up the Mile
PAUL: Dean , run Delacroix up to the infirmary and see if his fingers are broken .
BRUTAL: Course they 're broken , I heard the damn bones crack . Goddamn Percy .
HARRY: You hear what he was yelling when we brought the big dummy in ?
PAUL: How could I miss it , Harry ? The whole prison heard .
BRUTAL: You 'll probably have to answer fo sending him off the Mile . He 's gon na cause you trouble over this , you mark me .
PAUL: I 'll chew that food when I have to . Right now I wan na hear about the new inmateaside from how ig he is , okay ?
BRUTAL: Monstrous big . Damn .
PAUL: Seems meek enough . Looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute .
HARRY: Imbecile or not , he deserves to fry for what he done . Here
HOWIE: Papa ! Papa , look ! The blood !
KLAUS: Oh my God .
MARJORIE: Central ! Central , are you on the line ? Oh , God , please , somebody took my little girls
KLAUS: Oh , Lord , this belongs to my Katie
PAUL: Jesus .
COFFEY: John Coffey . Like the drink , only not spelt the same .
HAL: I interrupt ?
PAUL: I 'm just about done .
HAL: Melinda 's not so well , Paul . Not so well at all . Got laid up with another headache yesterday . Worst one yet . She 's also developed this weakness in her right hand .
PAUL: Doctor still think it 's migraines ? Hal gives a slight shake of his head .
HAL: I 'll be taking her up to Indianola next day or so for some tests . Had X-rays and the like . She is scared to death . Truth to tell , so am I .
PAUL: If it 's something they can see with an X-ray , maybe it 's something they can fix .
HAL: Maybe . He pulls a letter , hands it to Paul .
PAUL: You did n't come all the way down here just to hand me a D.O.E .
HAL: No . I had an angry call from the state capital about twenty minutes ago . Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the block .
PAUL: It is .
HAL: I 'm sure you had reason , but like it or not , the wife of the governor of this state has only one nephew , and his name happens to be Percy Wetmore . I need to tell you how this lays out ?
PAUL: Little Percy called his aunt and squealed like a schoolroom sissy . He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of shee petulance ? Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix 's left hand .
HAL: I did n't hear that part . I 'm sure she did n't either .
PAUL: The man is mean , careless , and stupid . Bad combination in a place like this . Sooner or later , he 's gon na get somebody hurt . Or worse .
HAL: You and Brutus Howell will make sure that does n't happen .
PAUL: Easy enough to say . We ca n't watch him every minute , Hal .
HAL: Stick with it . May not be much longer . I have it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar Ridge .
PAUL: The mental hospital ?
HAL: Administration job . Better pay .
PAUL: Then why 's he still here ? He could get that application pushed throughhell , with his connections , he could have any state job he wants .
HAL: Well , he 'll get his chance then , wo n't he ? Maybe then he 'll be satisfied and move on . In the meantime , you 'll keep the peace .
PAUL: Of course .
HAL: Thank you , Paul .
PAUL: You give Melinda my love , okay ? I et that X-ray turns out to be nothing at all .
JAN: Paul ?
PAUL: Hey , you . Music too loud ?
JAN: No . There 's just this big empty spot in the bed where my husband usually sleeps .
PAUL: He said to tell you he 's having a little trouble with that tonight .
JAN: Worried about Melinda and Hal ? Is that what 's got you up ?
PAUL: Yeah , that . Things .
JAN: Things .
PAUL: Got a new inmate today . Big , simple-minded fella .
JAN: Do I want to hear what he did ?
PAUL: No . One sleepless member of this family 's enough . The things that happen in this world . It 's a wonder God allows it .
JAN: Why do n't you come to bed ? I 've got something to help you sleep , and you can have all you want .
PAUL: Do n't I wish . I 've still got something wrong with my waterworks , I do n't want to pass it on .
JAN: You see Doc Sadler yet ?
PAUL: No , because he 'll want me to take sulfa tablets and I 'll spend the est of the week puking in every corner of my office . It 'll run its course all by itself , thank you very much for your concern .
JAN: Poor old guy
BRUTAL: I guess the legislature loosened those purse-strings enough to hire on a new guard . Look again . He 's right there .
PAUL: He 's doing a cell check .
DEAN: It ai n't normal for a mouse to come up on people that way . Maybe it 's rabid .
BRUTAL: Oh , my Christ . The big mouse expert . The Mouse Man . You see it foaming at the mouth , Mouse Man ?
DEAN: I do n't see its mouth at all .
BRUTAL: I just wan na see what he 'll do . In the interests of science , like .
DEAN: He 's in the damn restraint room . You know he 's gon na be chewing the padding out of walls and making himself a nice little nest .
PAUL: All right . Let 's get the damn mouse .
COFFEY: Saw me a mouse go by .
PAUL: It was a dream . Go back to sleep .
COFFEY: Were n't no dream . It was a mouse all right .
PAUL: Ca n't put anything over on you .
DEAN: Brutal or the mouse ?
BRUTAL: Har har , Mouse Man .
PAUL: You let him get past you .
DEAN: No I did n't , I was here all the time !
BRUTAL: Then where the hell is he ?
DEAN: Well , bright side is , all this commotion probably scared him off for good .
PAUL: Yeah , that 's right . That 's the last we 'll see of him
PAUL: You little son of a bitch . Harry and Bill glance up from their work .
HARRY: Well , I 'll be damned . There he is , ig as Billy-be-frigged . I thought Brutal was pulling my leg .
BILL: That 's a goddamn mouse .
HARRY: Yeah . Brute said he was in here last night begging for food , came ight up to the desk .
BILL: My ass . Give him some room , Percy , see what he does .
HARRY: Brave little bastard , got ta give him that .
BILL: Here , lem me try .
HARRY: Maybe he knows you 're just a floater . Got ta be an E Block egular to feed the E Block mouse , don'cha know
PERCY: FUCK !
HARRY: Percy met your mouse .
PERCY: It 's in here somewhere ! I 'm gon na squish the little son of a bitch !
BRUTAL: Percy , we already tried that
PERCY: What ? Whad'ja say ?
BRUTAL: I said
PAUL: Percy . You want to think about what you were doing just now .
PERCY: I know what I was doing . Trying to get the mouse . You blind ?
HARRY: You also scared the living crap out of me and Bill . And them .
PERCY: So what ? They are n't in cradle- school , case you did n't notice although you treat them that way half the time .
BRUTAL: We do n't scare 'em any more than we have to , Percy . They 're unde enough strain as it is .
PAUL: Men under strain can snap . Hurt themselves . Hurt others . That 's why our job is talking , not yelling . You 'll do better to think of this place like an intensive care ward in a hospital
PERCY: I think of it as a bucket of piss to drown rats in . That 's all . Anybody does n't like it can kiss my ass . How 's that sit ?
PAUL: We all know who your connections are , Percy but you ever threaten a man on this block again , we 're all gon na have a go . Job be damned .
PERCY: Big talk . You done ?
PAUL: Get all this shit back in the estraint room . You 're cluttering up my Mile . They turn and walk away , leaving Percy as we
COFFEY: Saw me a mouse go by .
PAUL: Arlen ? Your daughter and he family are here .
TOOT: Sittin ' down , sittin ' down , ehearsing now ! Everybody settle ! He glances to Paulokay , hit it .
PAUL: Arlen Bitterbuck , step forward .
TOOT: I 'm steppin ' forward , I 'm steppin ' forward , I 'm steppin ' forward
PAUL: Is his head properly shaved ?
DEAN: No , it 's dandruffy and it smells .
PAUL: I 'll take that for a yes . All ight , Arlen , let 's go .
TOOT: I 'm walkin ' the Mile , I 'm walkin ' the Mile , I 'm walkin ' the Mile
PAUL: Toot , you have to wait till I tell you to pray . Okay , pray .
TOOT: Still prayin ' , still prayin '
HARRY: Paul , we 're not gon na have some Cherokee medicine man in here whoopin ' and hollerin ' and shaking his dick , are we ?
PAUL: Well , actually
TOOT: Still prayin ' , prayin ' , gettin ' ight with Jesus
HARRY: Do it quietly , you old gink !
PAUL: As I was saying , I do n't believe they actually shake their dicks , Harry . Be that as it may , Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian , so we got Reverend Schuster coming in .
DEAN: Oh , he 's good . Fast , too . Does n't get 'em worked up .
PAUL: On your feet , Toot . You 've prayed enough for one day .
TOOT: Gettin ' to my feet , walkin ' again , walkin ' on the Green Mile
PERCY: What do I do ?
PAUL: Watch and learn .
TOOT: Sittin ' down , sittin ' down , takin ' a seat in Old Sparky 's lap
BRUTAL: Roll on one .
VAN HAY: `` Roll on one '' means I turn the generator up full . You 'll see the lights go brighter in half the prison
BRUTAL: Arlen Bitterbuck , you have been condemned to die by a jury of you peers , sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state . Do you have anything to say before the sentence is carried out ?
TOOT: Yeah ! I want a fried chicken dinner with gravy on the taters , I want to shit in your hat , and I got to have Mae West sit on my face , because I am one horny motherfucker !
PAUL: Shut up , Brutal . That goes fo everybody . I want quiet in here . Toot , another remark like that , I 'll have Van Hay roll on two fo eal .
BRUTAL: It was pretty funny .
PAUL: That 's why I do n't like it . Tomorrow night we 're doing this for real . I do n't want somebody emembering a stupid joke like that and getting going again . Ever try not laughing in church once something funny gets stuck in your head . Same goddamn thing .
BRUTAL: Sorry , Paul . You 're right . Let 's keep going . Harry
PERCY: What 's with the sponge ?
VAN HAY: You soak it in brine , get it good and wet . Conducts the electricity directly to the brain , fast like a bullet . You do n't ever want to throw the switch on a man without that .
BRUTAL: Arlen Bitterbuck , electricity shall now be passed through you ody until you are dead , in accordance with the state law . God have mercy on your soul . Roll on two .
VAN HAY: And that 's that .
TOOT: Now I 'm fryin ' ! Fryin ' ! Geeaaah ! Fryin ' like a done tom turkey !
BRUTAL: One of the witnesses showed up a day early .
PAUL: All right , let 's go again and do it right this time ! Get that idiot out of the chair
BITTERBUCK: You think if a man sincerely epents on what he done wrong , he might get to go back to the time that was happiest for him and live there forever ? Could that be what heaven is like ?
PAUL: I just about believe that very thing . Pause . Bitterbuck smiles .
BITTERBUCK: Had me a young wife when I was eighteen . Spent our first summe in the mountains . Made love every night . She 'd just lie there after , are-breasted in the firelight , and we 'd talk sometimes till the sun come up . That was my best time .
PAUL: It 'll be fine . You 'll do fine .
BRUTAL: Roll on two .
PERCY: Adios , Chief . Drop us a card from hell , let us know if it 's hot enough .
BRUTAL: He 's paid what he 's owed . He 's square with the house again , so keep your goddamn hands off him .
PERCY: What 's up his ass ?
PAUL: You , Percy . Always you . Paul brushes past him , but
PERCY: You got ta hate the new boy ? That the way it is around here ?
PAUL: Why not just move on ? Go to Bria Ridge . Yeah , I know about it . Sounds like a good job .
PERCY: I might take it , too . Soon as you put me out front . Paul cocks his headexcuse me ?
PAUL: What 's with you ? Seeing a man die is n't enough ? You got ta be close enough to smell his nuts cook ?
PERCY: I wan na be out front , is all . Just one time . Then you 'll be rid of me .
PAUL: If I say no ?
PERCY: I might just stick around fo good , make me a career of this .
COFFEY: Del ?
PAUL: Delacroix ? That you ?
DEL: Look ! I done tame me dat mouse !
PAUL: We see that .
DEL: Watch dis ! Watch what he do !
PAUL: Mr. Jingles ?
DEL: Dat his name . He whisper it in my ear . Cap ' n , can I have a box fo my mouse so he can sleep in here wi ' me ?
PAUL: I notice your English gets bette when you want something .
DEL: Wan na see what else he can do ? Watch , watch , watch
BRUTAL: Who 's training who here ?
COFFEY: That 's some smart mouse , Del . Like he 's a circus mouse or something .
DEL: A circus mouse ! Dat jus ' what he is , too ! A circus mouse ! I get outta here , he make me rich , see if he do n't !
PERCY: Well , well . Looks like you found yourself a new friend , Eddie .
DEL: Don ' hurt him , 'kay ? 'kay ?
PERCY: That the one I chased ?
PAUL: Yes , that 's the one . Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles .
PERCY: Is that so ?
PAUL: Del was just asking for a box . He thinks the mouse will sleep in it , I guess . That he might keep it fo a pet . What do you think ?
PERCY: I think it 'll shit up his nose some night and run away , but I guess that 's Del 's lookout . We oughtta find a cigar box . Get some cotton batting from he dispensary to line it with . That should do real nice .
PAUL: Man said get a cigar box .
HAL: Yeah . Paul . Close the door .
PAUL: Hal ?
HAL: It 's a tumor , Paul . A brain tumor .
PAUL: oh Godoh God
JAN: What ?
PAUL: To the doctor . I 'm going . Today . Just as soon as we get the new inmate squares away .
JAN: That bad ?
PAUL: Oh yeah .
HARRY: Boy 's doped to the gills . Dean , hand me them clothes
PERCY: Hellraiser , huh ? Looks more like a limp noodle to me . Hey ! Hey , you ! Billy looks up , meets Percy 's eyes .
DEAN: C'mon , Percy , give us a hand .
DEL: Don ' look so good , boss . Look like you runnin ' you a fever .
PAUL: Got things to tend to just now , John Coffey . You be still in you cell now , y'hear ?
COFFEY: Careful .
BILLY: Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo !
PAUL: LET HIM GO !
BRUTAL: Breathebreathethat 's it
HARRY: We thought he was doped . Did n't we ? Did n't we all of us think he was doped ? Percy nods , still numb . Paul is furious
PAUL: You did n't ask ? I guess that 's not a mistake you 'll be need to make again anytime soon , is it ?
BRUTAL: What about you ? You look about eady to collapse .
PAUL: I 've got the Mile till you all get ack . Go on now .
COFFEY: Closer .
PAUL: I 'm alone here right now , John . Figure this is close enough .
COFFEY: Boss , please . I got to whisper in your ear .
DEL: Boss ? You know you not s'pose to do dat .
PAUL: Mind your business , Del . What do you want , John Coffey ?
COFFEY: Just to help .
PAUL: What are youdoing ?
PAUL: Del , Chrissake , settle down , I 'm fine
COFFEY: I helped it . Did n't I help it ?
PAUL: Yes , buthow ? Coffey shrugsit 's something that just is .
COFFEY: Just took it back , is all . Awful tired now , boss . Dog tired .
DEL: What dat man do to you ? He throw some gris-gris on you ? You look diff'int ! Even walk diff'int . Like y'all better !
PAUL: You 're imagining thing . Lie down , Del . Get you some rest . Paul continues up the Mile
JAN: Hi , honey . How are you feeling ?
PAUL: Umnot too bad .
JAN: What did the doctor say ?
PAUL: Oh , you know doctors . Gobble-de- gook mostly .
JAN: Paul ? What are you doing ?
PAUL: What 's it feel like ?
JAN: I know what it feels likeit feels greatbutPaul
PAUL: Wellthing isI never actually got to the doctor yesterday She gives him a lookoh ?
JAN: You sure you ought to do this ?
PAUL: I 'm not sure what I 'm sure of .
CYNTHIA: I offer you a cold drink ?
PAUL: Yes , ma'am , a cold drink would be fine . Thank you . She goes back inside . Burt rises .
BURT: That depends , Mr. ?
PAUL: Paul Edgecomb . I 'm the E Block superintendant at Cold Mountain .
BURT: The Green Mile . I 've heard of it . Lost a few clients your way .
PAUL: That 's why I 'm here . I 'd like to ask you about one of them . Burt settles back down , motions `` please sit '' .
BURT: Which client ? Now you got my curiosity aroused .
PAUL: John Coffey .
BURT: Ah , Coffey . He causing you problems ?
PAUL: No , ca n't say he is . He does n't like the dark . He cries on occasion . Other than that
BURT: Cries , does he ? Well , he 's got a lot to cry about , I 'd say . You know what he did .
PAUL: I read the court transcripts .
CYNTHIA: My pleasure . Kids ! Lunch is about eady ! Y'all come on up !
BURT: What exactly are you trying to find out ? Satisfy my curiosity , I 'll see if I can satisfy yours .
PAUL: I 've wondered if he ever did anything like that before .
BURT: Why ? Has he said anything ?
PAUL: No . But a man who does a thing like that has often developed a taste for it over time . Occurred to me it might be easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out . A man his size , and colored to oot , ca n't be that hard to trace .
BURT: You 'd think so , but you 'd be wrong . Believe me , we tried . It 's like he dropped out of the sky .
PAUL: How do you explain that ?
BURT: We 're in a Depression . A third of the country 's out of work . People are drifting by the thousands , looking for work , looking for that greener grass . Even a giant like Coffey would n't get noticed everywhere he goes not until he kills a couple of little girls .
PAUL: He'sstrange , I admit . But there does n't seem to be any real violence in him . I know violent men , Mr. Hammersmith . I deal with 'em day in and day out . Burt smiles , realizing
BURT: You did n't come up here to ask me whether he might have killed efore . You came up here to see if I think he did it at all . That 's it , is n't it ?
PAUL: Do you ?
BURT: One seldom sees a less ambiguous case . He was found with the victims in his arms . Blurted out a confession right then and there .
PAUL: Yet you defended him .
BURT: Everyone is entitled to a defense . Cynthia hollers from an open window
CYNTHIA: Kids ! Lunch !
BURT: Y'all listen to your Momma , now !
PAUL: I 'm listening .
BURT: We had us a dog . No particula eed , but gentle . Ready to lick your hand or fetch a stick . Just a sweet mongrel , you know the kind . In many way , a good mongrel dog is like you negro . You get to know it , and often you get to love it . It is of no particular use , but you keep it around because you think it loves you . If you 're lucky , Mr. Edgecomb , you neve have to find out any different . My wife and I were not so lucky . Caleb . Come here for a second .
PAUL: I 'm sorry for your trouble .
BURT: I 'm as enlightened as the next man , Mr. Edgecomb . I would not ing back slavery for all the tea in China . I believe we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the race problem . But we have to remember that the negro will bite if he gets the chance , just like a mongrel dog will bite if it crosses its mind to do so . Is Coffey guilty ? Yes , he is . Do n't you doubt it , and do n't you turn your back on him . You might get away with it once or even a hundred timesbut in the end
PAUL: No , it 's not for you .
DEL: Oh . Oh my .
COFFEY: I 'm smelling me some cornbread . Paul speaks softly so the others ca n't hear
PAUL: It 's from my missus . She wanted to thank you .
COFFEY: Thank me for what ?
PAUL: You know . For helping me .

PAUL: What happens on the Mile , stays on the Mile . Always has .
PERCY: You keep laughing , you French- fried faggot . You just keep laughing .
PAUL: What about Dean ? He 's got a little oy would love a pet mouse , I bet . Del looks horrified at the thought .
DEL: How could a boy be trust wid Mr. Jingles ? Maybe forget to feed him . And how he keep up wid his trainin ' , just a boy , n'est-ce pas ?

PERCY: You expect me to believe that ? I heard the goddamn thing crunch .
PAUL: Are n't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay ? After all our talks about how we should keep the prisoners calm ? Are n't you relieved ?
PERCY: What kind of game is this ?
PAUL: No game . See for yourself .
PERCY: You switched them ! You switched them somehow , you bastards !
BRUTAL: I always keep a spare mouse in my wallet for occasions such as this .
PERCY: You 're playing with me , the both of you ! Just who the hell do you think you are
PAUL: We 're the people you work with , Percy , but not for long . I want your word .
PERCY: My word ?
PAUL: I put you out front for Del , you put in your transfer to Bria Ridge the very next day .
PERCY: What if I just call up certain people and tell them you 're harassing me ? Bullying me ?
PAUL: Go ahead . I promise you 'll leave your share of blood on the floor .
PERCY: Over a mouse ? You think anyone 's gon na give two shits ?
PAUL: No . But four men will swear you stood by while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean to death . About that people will care , Percy . Even you uncle the governor will care .
BRUTAL: Thing like that goes in your work ecord . Work record can follow a man around a long , long time .
PAUL: I put you out front , you put in your transfer . That 's the deal .
DEL: Hey , boys . Say hi , Mr. Jingles .
PAUL: Eduard Delacroix , will you step forward ?
DEL: Boss Edgecomb ?
PAUL: Yes , Del ?
DEL: Don ' let nothin ' happen to Mr. Jingles , okay ?

COFFEY: You be still , Mr. Jingles . You be so quiet and so still .
PERCY: Eduard Delacroix , you have been condemned to die by a jury of you peers , sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state . You have anything to say before sentence is carried out ?

PERCY: No such place . That 's just a fairy tale these guys told you to keep you quiet . Just thought you should know , faggot .
PAUL: It 's dry !
BRUTAL: Do n't you tell him to stop . Do n't you do it . It 's too late for that .
WITNESSES: What the hell 's happening to him ? Are those clamps going to hold ? Christ , the smell ! Is this normal ?
FAT LADY: Stop it , stop it , oh ca n't you see he 's had enough ?
HAL: Why do n't you shut it down ?
PAUL: He 's still alive ! You want me to shut down while he 's still alive ?
BRUTAL: You do it . You 're running the show , ai n't you ?
HAL: It 's all right , folks , it 's all under control . Just a power surge from the storm , that 's all , nothing to worry about
PAUL: Dean , get doc 's stethoscope .
MAN: Oh my God ! Is it always like this ? Why did n't somebody tell me ? I never would have come !
PERCY: I did n't know the sponge was supposed to be wet
PAUL: Brutal , no !
BRUTAL: What do you mean , no ? How can you say no ? You saw what he did !
PAUL: Delacroix 's dead , nothing can change that , and Percy 's not worth it !
BRUTAL: So he just gets away with it ? Is that how it works ? Hal comes lunging down the stairs , furious
HAL: What the fuck was that ? Jesus Christ , three witnesses puked all over the floor up there ! And the smell ! I got Van Hay to open both doors , but that smell wo n't come out for five damn years , that 's what I 'm betting ! And that asshole Wharton is singing about it ! I can hear him !
PAUL: Can he carry a tune , Hal ?
HAL: Okay , boys . Okay . Now what the hell happened ?
PERCY: I did n't know the sponge was supposed to be wet . Beat . A look of utter contempt from Hal .
HAL: How many years you spend pissing on the toilet seat before somebody told you to put it up ?
PAUL: Percy fucked up , Hal . Pure and simple .
HAL: Is that your official position ?
PAUL: Do n't you think it should be ? Hal considers it , nods .
HAL: You 're a little asshole , and I do n't like you a bit . Have that transfer request on my desk first thing .
BILLY: Barbecue ! Me and you ! Stinky , pinky , phew-phew-phew ! Were n't Billy or Jilly or Hilly or Royit was a French-fried faggot named Delacroix !
PAUL: You 're about ten seconds away from spending the rest of your life in the padded room .
COFFEY: Poor Del . Poor old Del .
PAUL: Yes . Poor old Del . John , are you okay ?
COFFEY: I could feel it from here .
PAUL: What do you mean ? You could hea it ? Is that what you mean ?
COFFEY: He 's out of it now , though . He 's the lucky one . No matter how it happened , Del 's the lucky one . Paul realizes he wo n't get a coherent answer .
PAUL: Where 's Mr. Jingles ?
COFFEY: Ran down there . Do n't think he 'll e back . Awful tired now , boss . Dog tired . Coffey lays down , turns to face the wall .
PAUL: Me too , John . Me too .
JAN: I know .
HAL: She 's having one of her good days . I thank God for that .
PAUL: What a bad day ?
HAL: Sometimes she'snot herself anymore . She swears .
PAUL: Swears .
HAL: It just pops out , the most awful language you can imagine . She does n't even know she 's doing it . I did n't know she 'd ever heard words like thatand to hear he say them in her sweet voice I 'm glad she 's having a good day , Paul . I 'm glad for you and Jan .
JAN: Honey ? If you do n't say what 's on your mind , I 'm afraid I 'll have to smother you with a pillow .
PAUL: I 'm thinking I love you . I 'm thinking I do n't know what I 'd do if you were gone .
JAN: Oh .
PAUL: I 'm also thinking I 'd like to have the boys over tomorrow . Off Jan 's look , we
THE MEN: Ma'am , you sure know how to fry up some fine chickenBrutal , do n't hog the taters nowTry that corn yet ? It 's something special Paul softly interjects
PAUL: You saw what he did with the mouse .
BRUTAL: I could ' a gone the rest of the day without you bringing that up .
DEAN: I could ' a gone the rest of the year .
PAUL: He did it to me too . He put his hands on me and took my bladde infection away . The men absorb this . Brutal glances to Jan .
JAN: When he came home , he wasall etter .
DEAN: You 're talking about an authentic healing . A praise-Jesus miracle .
PAUL: I am .
BRUTAL: If you say it , I accept it . But what 's it got to do with us ?
JAN: Melinda ? Oh , Paul
BRUTAL: Melinda ? Melinda Moores ? Paul nodsthat 's who we 're talking about .
JAN: You really think you can help her ?
PAUL: It 's not a bladder infection , o even a busted-up mouse . But there might be a chance .
HARRY: Hold on now . You 're talking about our jobs . Sneak a sick woman onto a cellblock ?
PAUL: Hal would never allow that . You know him , he would n't believe something unless it fell on him .
BRUTAL: So you 're talking about taking John Coffey to her . That 's more than just our jobs , Paul .
DEAN: Damn right . That 's prison time if we get caught .
HARRY: Let 's not discuss this like it 's even an option . Brutal , help me out here
BRUTAL: I 'm sure she 's a fine woman
JAN: The finest .
PAUL: What 's happening to her is an offense , Brutal . To the eyes and the ears and the heart .
BRUTAL: I have no doubt . But we do n't know her like you and Jan dodo we ?
PAUL: That 's why it 's a lot to ask .
HARRY: It is . Let 's not forget Coffey 's a murderer . What if he escapes ? I 'd hate losing my job or going to prison , but I 'd hate having a dead child on my conscience even more .
PAUL: I do n't think that 'll happen in fact , I do n't think he did it at all . The men are stunned by this . Off their looks
DEAN: Well , that 's a tender notion , but the man 's on death row for the crime . Plus , he 's huge . If he tried to get away , it 'd take a lot of bullets to stop him .
BRUTAL: We 'd all have shotguns in addition to sidearms . I 'd insist on that . He tried anything , we 'd have to take him down . You understand .
PAUL: I understand .
BRUTAL: So . Tell us what you had in mind .
ORDERLY: Shit , for five bucks , you was never nowhere .
BRUTAL: Fellas thirsty ? Fresh out of the icebox .
DEAN: Oh , thanks . That 's swell .
HARRY: Yeah , hot in here .
BILLY: Hey . Hey , I 'm ' a get some too .
BRUTAL: My ass you get some too .
PAUL: You think you deserve any ?
HARRY: Day report says he 's been okay .
BILLY: Hell , yes , I been behaved . C'mon , now , do n't be stingy hogs .
PAUL: You gon na stay behaved ?
BILLY: C'mon , you clunk , gim me that .
PAUL: You promise me , or I 'll drink it myself right here in front of you .
BILLY: C'mon now , do n't be that way . I be good .
PAUL: Cup .
BILLY: We 'll break out the fire hose and take it anyway . And you will have drunk your last R.C . cola . Unless they serve 'em down in hell .
PAUL: Anybody wants to back out , now 's the time . After this , there 's no turning back . So ? We gon na do this ? A voice comes softly from down the way
COFFEY: Sure . I 'd like to take a ride .
BRUTAL: Guess were all in .
PERCY: What is this ?
PAUL: Payback .
PERCY: Let go of me ! Let go !
PAUL: Settle down , Percy !
BRUTAL: Oooo , Poicy ! What would you mother say ?
PERCY: Let go , you ignoramus ! I know people ! Big people !
PAUL: So you 've said . C'mon , stick out your arms like a good boy .
PERCY: I wo n't . And you ca n't make me .
BRUTAL: You 're dead wrong about that , you know .
PAUL: The man 's ripping your ears off , Percy . I 'd do as he says .
PERCY: Please , Paul . Do n't put me in with Wild Bill . Please .
PAUL: You would think that . Paul gives him a hard , angry shove
BRUTAL: You 'll get 'em back , do n't worry .
PERCY: That 's more than I can say about your jobs . All your jobs ! You ca n't do this to me ! You ca n't !
PAUL: Let you in on a little secret . We can and we are .
BRUTAL: If you get lonely , think about Olive Oyl uk-uk-uk-uk !
PAUL: One more timewhat do you say if somebody comes by ?
DEAN: Coffey got upset , so we put him in the restraint room . They hear any noise , they 'll think it 's him . They come to Coffey 's cell .
COFFEY: We goan for the ride now ?
PAUL: That 's right .
DEAN: You 're over in Admin , going ove Del 's file . Brutal and Harry are in the laundry doing their wash
BILLY: Where you fink you 're goin ' ? Coffey responds softly , with utmost horror
COFFEY: You 're a bad man .
BILLY: S'right , nigger . Bad as you 'd want .
COFFEY: He 's a bad man .
PAUL: John , come along ! Right now , y'hear ? C'mon ! Toward that door ! Coffey finally responds , pulling away
COFFEY: Say . This is fun .
PAUL: Shhh . John , you have to be quiet now .
COFFEY: You see her ? You see the lady ?
BRUTAL: We see her , John .
PAUL: C'mon , big boy , keep moving .
BRUTAL: How far is it ?
HARRY: Just up ahead
COFFEY: Hey there , little firefly . Where 's Mrs. Firefly this evening ?
PAUL: They seemdrawn to you .
COFFEY: I love 'em , is why . They do n't think no hurtful thoughts . They 's just happy to be . Happy little lightning bugs
PAUL: C'mon , big boy . Upsy-daisy .
COFFEY: Help a lady ?
PAUL: That 's right . Help a lady . But how did you know ?
COFFEY: Dunno . Tell the truth , boss , I do n't know much ' a anything . Neve have .
BRUTAL: We can still turn back . Paul hesitates , wanting to do just that , but
COFFEY: Boss , look . Someone 's up .
BRUTAL: This is a mistake . Christ , Paul , what were we thinking ?
PAUL: Too late now . Harry , keep John here until we call you .
HAL: Who the hell goes there at two- thirty in the goddamn morning ?
PAUL: Hal , it 's us ! It 's Paul and Brutalit 's us !
HAL: Paul , what are you doing here at this hour ? Jesus , it 's not a lockdown , is it ? Or a riot ?
PAUL: Hal , God 's sakes , take your finge off the trigger
HAL: Are you hostages ? Who 's out there ? Who 's by that truck ?
PAUL: No one 's hurt . We 're here to help .
HAL: Help what ? I do n't understand . Is this a prison break ?
PAUL: I ca n't explain what it is . You just have to trust me .
HAL: What do youwant ?
MELINDA: Hal ! Make them go away ! No salesmen in the middle of the night ! No Fuller brushes ! No French knickers with come in the crotch ! Tell them to take a flying fuck in a rolling dd
COFFEY: Just to help . Just to help , boss , that 's all .
HAL: You ca n't . No one can .
COFFEY: Boss , you just be quiet now and let me be .
MELINDA: Oh , so big ! Pull down your pants ! Let 's have a look !
COFFEY: Do n't hardly remember , ma'am .
MELINDA: What 's your name ?
COFFEY: John Coffey , ma'am . Like the drink , only not spelt the same .
MELINDA: Yes , John Coffey ?
COFFEY: I see it . I see it . He comes closercloser still
BRUTAL: John ! Sick it up ! Cough 'em out like you done before !
MELINDA: How did I get here ? We were going to the hospital in Indianola , were n't we ? We stopped and you ought me a packet of posies
HAL: Shhh . It does n't matter . It does n't matter anymore .
MELINDA: Did I have the X-ray ? Did I
PAUL: Yes . They both look at him .
MELINDA: Who is that man ?
PAUL: John ? Can you turn around ? Can you turn around and see this lady ?
MELINDA: What 's your name ?
COFFEY: John Coffey , ma'am .
MELINDA: Like the drink , only not spelled the same .
COFFEY: No , ma'am . Not spelt the same at all .
HAL: Melly , no
MELINDA: I dreamed of you . I dreamed you were wandering in the dark , and so was I . We found each other . We found each other in the dark .
COFFEY: Thank you , ma'am .
MELINDA: Thank you , John .
PAUL: C'mon , John , stay on your feet .
HARRY: Christ , he goes down , we 'll need three mules and a crane to pick him up again
BRUTAL: He 'll never sit in Old Sparky . You know that , do n't you ? He swallowed that stuff for a eason . I give him a few days . One of us 'll be doing a cell check and there he 'll be . Dead on his bunk .
PAUL: If that 's his choice , he 's earned it . Let 's get him back on the Mile .
DEAN: Am I glad to see you ! You were gone so long ! Wild Bill 's making noises like he 's gon na wake up What the hell 's wrong with him ?
BRUTAL: He 's hurting , Dean . Hurting bad .
PAUL: John , we 're gon na set you on you unk now . Ready ?
DEAN: What about Mrs. Moores ? Was it like the mouse ? Was it ayou knowa miracle ?
PAUL: Yes . Yes it was .
HARRY: Damn . I think we got away with it .
BRUTAL: We still got ta convince a certain somebody to keep his trap shut .
PAUL: Get his stuff .
BRUTAL: My mother always said if you do it fast , it wo n't hurt so much .
PERCY: Get me out of this nut-coat .
PAUL: In a minute .
PERCY: Now ! Now ! Right n
PAUL: You shut up and listen . You deserved to be punished for what you did to Del . You 'll accept it like a man , or we 'll make you sorry you were ever born . We 'll tell people how you sabotaged Del 's execution
PERCY: Sabotaged !
PAUL: and how you pissed yourself like a frightened little girl . Yes , we 'll talk , that 's a givenbut , Percy , mind me nowwe 'll also see you beaten within an inch of your life . Percy blinks , unable to grasp that .
BRUTAL: What happens on the Mile , stays on the Mile . Always has . A long pause . Softly
PERCY: May I be let out of this coat now ?
PAUL: Think it over , Percy .
PERCY: Oh , I intend to . I intend to think about it very hard . Starting right now .
BRUTAL: He 'll talk . Sooner or later .
PAUL: Easy , easy . You all right ?
BILLY: What ' a you looking at , you limp noodle ? You wan na kiss my ass o suck my dick ?
DEAN: Oh God , oh God , no
COFFEY: Punished them bad men .
PAUL: Why Wild Bill ? Why ?
COFFEY: I saw in his heart . When he gra my arm , I saw what Wild Billy done . Saw plain as day . Ca n't hide what 's in your heart .
PAUL: What ? Saw what ?
COFFEY: Take my hand , boss . You see fo yourself .
BRUTAL: Paul , no !
COFFEY: My hand .
PAUL: Noplease
COFFEY: Gots to , boss . Gots to give you a little bit of myself . A gift , like . A gift of what 's in me so you can see and Paul sees
BILLY: You lover your sister ? You make any noise , know what happens ? I 'll kill her instead of you . And if you make any noise , I 'll kill her . And he drags them out into the coming dawn
COFFEY: He kill 'em with they love . They love for each other . You see how it is ?
DEAN: well , I dunno , he just snapped , I guess
HARRY: s'right , one minute he 's fine , the nextblammo
BRUTAL: bastard grabbed him through the ars a few days back , scared the oy so bad he wet himself Hal turns , sees
COP #1: Son ! Son ! Can you hear me ?
COP #2: Speak up if you can hear us ! We got ta ask you some questions !
MEDIC: I think this boy 's cheese slid off his cracker .
PAUL: No .
JAN: You saw him . You actually saw this Wild Bill person take those girls .
PAUL: Their father hired him on for a few days last spring , help repai the barn . Cheap labor , just another drifter
BRUTAL: Only not .
PAUL: Sick bastard came back a month later , just before dawn . Took the girlsdid what he did . Coffey found them afterwards and tried to help . It was too late .
JAN: Then you can stop it . The execution , I mean . Get Coffey a new trial .
PAUL: Based on what , honey ? Some kind of magical vision I had ?
JAN: Show this farmerwhat 's his name , Detterick ? show him a picture of Wild Bill . Why not ? If Wharton was thereif the farmer can identify his picture and they know he was there
BRUTAL: Him being there in May does n't mean he came back and killed those girls in June . Even if he was committing other crimes .
PAUL: They got their killer as far as they 're concerned . Hell , Coffey 's own lawyer would come throw the switch if we let him .
JAN: Then lie .
PAUL: Lie ? About what ?
JAN: Tell them Wharton confessed to the crime . Brutus , you can back him up , say you heard it too . You can say that 's what set Percy off . He shot Wharton because he could n't stand thinking of what happened to those two little girls , it snapped his mind what ? What now ?
DEAN: We never reported anything like that . We would 've , too , everybody knows it . It 's part of our job .
BRUTAL: Besides , confessing do n't make it so . Slugs like Wild Bill lie about everything . Crimes they committed , women they had , even the weather .
JAN: But he was there ! He painted thei arn ! He ate dinner with them !
PAUL: All the more reason he might take credit for the crime . He 's gon na fry anyway , so why not boast ? Jan stands thinking for a moment , then
JAN: All right . Then you 've got to get John Coffey out on your own .
HARRY: Ma'am ?
JAN: You did it once , did n't you ? Only this time , do n't bring him back . Dean blinks , stunned by this notion . Gently
DEAN: Ma'am , your son 's grown up and moved away . My kids are just starting kindergarten . Will you be the one to explain to them why their daddy 's in prison ?
JAN: Work out a plan . Make it look like a real escape .
HARRY: Better be a plan an imbecile could dream up . Nobody 'd believe it otherwise .
BRUTAL: Even if we did think of something , it would n't do any good .
JAN: Why not ? Just why the hell not ?
PAUL: Because he 's a six-foot-eight-inch aldheaded black man with barely enough brains to feed himself . How long you think it 'd be before he was recaptured ? Two hours ? Six ?
JAN: Do you mean to kill him , you cowards ? Do you ?
PAUL: Even that time we went camping and you called me Old Stinky Sam ?
JAN: Does Hal know ? That Coffey 's innocent , I mean ? Can he help ? Does he have the influence to do something about this ?
PAUL: No .
JAN: Then do n't tell him . If he ca n't help , do n't tell him . Ever .
PAUL: I wo n't .
JAN: There 's no way out of this fo you , is there ?
PAUL: No . I 've been thinking about it , too , believe me . Tell you the truth , honey . I 've done some things in my life I 'm not proud of , but this is the first time I 've ever felt in real danger of hell .

GARY I: You know where they are , Peltzer ?
BILLY: NoBut they 're all gathered in one place . And the sun rose before they could make it to the wate tower . So they must be holed up etween here and there .

LILLY: You always did .
MYRA: `` Down to the track ? ''

MYRA: You 're just comfortable , that 's all . You do n't even ask to go home . You just lie around , let your mama take care of you .
ROY: Mama !
MYRA: Who else is paying for all this ? You badmouth the woman all the time , but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you .
ROY: I 'll pay Lilly back , do n't you worry about that .
MYRA: I do n't like to come here , Roy . Every time I do , your mother comes in and makes remarks .
ROY: That 's just Lilly 's way .
MYRA: And you never defend me . You 're afraid of her .
ROY: Oh , do n't be stupid .
MYRA: You 're a mama 's boy , if you want the truth .
ROY: Are you kid ? I had n't even seen her in seven years !
LILLY: Should my ears be burning ?
MYRA: They might as well .
LILLY: I heard those skirts were coming ack .
MYRA: Get well soon .
ROY: Every day in every way .
MYRA: I 'll see you when you get home .
ROY: What happened to your hand ?
LILLY: Just a little accident . I went by your place , picked up your mall . Just bills , I 'll take care of them .
ROY: I can take care of my own bills , Lilly .
LILLY: Whatever you say . The manager says your boss called . Really pulled the wool ove everybody 's eyes , huh ?
ROY: What are you talking about ? So I 've got a job . So what ?
LILLY: Stop kidding me ! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez , and a peanut selling job is the best you can do ? You expect me to believe that ?
ROY: It 's there . The boss called , you said so yourself .
LILLY: And that dump you live in ! Those clown pictures on the walls !
ROY: I like those .
LILLY: You do not ! Roy Dillon ? Cornball clown pictures ? Commission salesman ? It 's all a front , is n't it ? You 're on the grift , I know you are . You 're working some angle , and do n't tell me you 're not because I wrote the book !
ROY: You 're one to talk . Still running playback money for the mob .
LILLY: That 's me . That 's who I am . You were never cut out for the rackets , Roy , and if you
ROY: How come ?
LILLY: You are n't tough enough .
ROY: Not as tough as you , huh ?
LILLY: No . And you have to be .
ROY: Up to you .
LILLY: My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus , ack in Baltimore . When a long shot gets too much action , I have to put money on that horse at the track , ecause it 's the only way to get the odds down .
ROY: Sure .
LILLY: The first day of the Delmar meet , there was a nag called Bluebell . I should have been on it . But that was the day after you came in here , so I stuck around to see how you were gon na be .
ROY: Bluebell came in ?
LILLY: I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money , like it was the winnings from my bets . I hoped that would cover me . It did n't .
BOBO: Did I buy you that dress , you piece of shit ?
LILLY: Well , I guess so . You 're the guy I work for .
BOBO: You work for me , huh ? Then I just may flush you down the toilet . Drive me to the Durando .
LILLY: I 'm not getting away with anything , Bobo .
BOBO: You 're fuckin right you 're not . How much did your pals cut you in fo on that nag , huh ? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me ?
LILLY: I was down on that horse , Bobo . Not as much as I should have been , but there was a lot of action on those
BOBO: One question . Do you want to stick to that story , or do you want to keep your teeth ?
LILLY: I want to keep my teeth .
BOBO: Now I 'll ask you another . You think I got no contacts out here ? That nag paid off at just the opening price . There was n't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted . There ai n't enough action to tickle the tote , but you claim a ten grand win ! You send me ten thousand dollars , like I 'm some mark you can blow off !
LILLY: Bobo , no , I
BOBO: You wan na talk to me straight up ?
LILLY: My son
BOBO: Your what ?
LILLY: My son was in the hospital
BOBO: What the fuck are you doin with a son ?
LILLY: He left home a long time ago . He was in the hospital , up in Los Ang gleez , real sick .
BOBO: Motherhood .
LILLY: I never fucked up before , Bobo .
BOBO: You expect me to buy this ?
LILLY: You do buy it , Bobo . I cost you , and I 'm sorry .
BOBO: I got a lot of people work for me , Lilly . I ca n't have shit like this .
LILLY: It 'll never happen again . I swear .
BOBO: It happened once . With me , that 's making a habit of it .
LILLY: You 're calling the shots .
BOBO: You got any kind of long coat in the car ? Anything you can wear home over your clothes ?
LILLY: No .
BOBO: I 'll loan you a raincoat .
LILLY: You mean , the insurance frammis ?
BOBO: Tell me about the oranges , Lilly .
LILLY: You hit a person with the oranges in the towel , they get big , awful looking bruises , but they do n't eally get hurt , not if you do it ight . It 's for working scams against insurance companies .
BOBO: And if you do it wrong ?
LILLY: It can louse up your insides . You can get puh , puh , puh
BOBO: What 's that , Lilly ?
LILLY: Permanent damage .
BOBO: You 'll never shit right again .
LILLY: Oh , thanks , Bobo .
BOBO: You want a drink ?
LILLY: Gee , I better not , if it 's okay . I still got ta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez .
BOBO: See your son , huh ? Well , that 's nice . A side of you I did n't know , Lilly .
LILLY: He 's a good kid . A salesman .
BOBO: On the square , huh ? And how are you making out these days ? Stealing much ?
LILLY: From you ? My folks did n't raise any stupid kids .
BOBO: Not skimming a thing , Lilly ?
LILLY: Oh , well , you know . I just clip a uck here and a buck there . Not enough to notice .
BOBO: That 's right . Take a little , leave a little .
LILLY: A person that do n't look out fo himself is too dumb to look out fo anybody else . He 's a liability , ight , Bobo ?
BOBO: You 're a thousand percent right !
LILLY: Or else he 's working an angle . If he does n't steal a little , he 's steeling big .
BOBO: You know it , Lilly .
LILLY: You know , I like that suit , Bobo . I do n't know what there is about it , ut it somehow makes you look taller .
BOBO: Yeah ? You really think so ? A lot of people been telling me the same thing .
LILLY: Well , you can tell them I said they 're right . I better get going . Roy 'll wonde where I am .
BOBO: Worries about his mother , eh ? Give him a hug for me .
LILLY: I will . So long , Bobo .
ROY: Lucky ? You call that lucky ?
LILLY: He let me live . He let me be his friend .
ROY: You do n't put up with that ! Nobody has to put up with that !
LILLY: You do if you 're where I am . Where you want to be . How 'd you get that punch in the stomach , Roy ?
ROY: I tripped over a chair .
LILLY: Get off the grift , Roy .
ROY: Why ?
LILLY: I just give you your life . What you do with it is up to you .
ROY: That 's right .
SIMMS: Your difference between your folded towel and your clean towel is a trip to the laundry . When you 're cleaning those bathrooms , what you do , you pick up the towel , you give it a good shake and a good look , and you say to yourself , 'Would I dry myself on this towel ? ' If the answer 's yes , fold it .
MAID: What if it 's wet ?
SIMMS: Mr. Dillon ! Welcome back ! You look fine , just fine .
ROY: Thanks , Mr. Simms , I 'm feeling fine .
MAID: I 'm glad you 're better .
SIMMS: You 're well liked around here , Mr. Dillon . The entire staff will be pleased to see you 're back .
ROY: Well , thank you . And thank them .
SIMMS: Sickness comes to us all , Miste Dillon .
ROY: That 's true , Mr. Simms .
SIMMS: We never know when and we neve know why . We never know how . The only blessed thing we know is , it 'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time . Just when you 've got tickets to the World Series . And that 's the way the permanent waves .
ROY: Well , I 'm back now . I just wanted you to know . Got ta rush .
SIMMS: Happy to see you looking so good .
MAID: Yes , sir .
ROY: Whadaya say ?
KAGGS: Hello .
CLERK: Roy ! Welcome back .
ROY: What 's going on ? This is usually coffee break time .
CLERK: Not since Kaggs showed up .
ROY: Hey , yeah , I 'm fine , everything 's great . What 's this Kaggs ? Sounds like a disease .
2ND CLERK: It is .
CLERK: Troubleshooter from the main office . Came out here right afte you went into the hospital , and he ai n't had a kind word for anybody yet .
3RD CLERK: Nobody knows anything but him .
CLERK: He chopped off half a dozen salesmen ; wo n't wholesale to them any more .
2ND CLERK: What kind of sense does that make ? They 're all on commission .
ROY: You think he 'll chop me ?
CLERK: If he does , he 's crazy .
2ND CLERK: Here he comes !
KAGGS: Kaggs . Home office .
ROY: Roy Dillon .
KAGGS: I know that . Knew it when I saw you out there . The best salesman here , which is n't saying much . Want to talk to you , Dillon .
ROY: That was a pretty backhanded compliment . If I let people get away with things like that , I would n't be a good salesman .
KAGGS: You 're right . I apologize . But I still want to talk to you .
ROY: Lead on .
KAGGS: Take a seat .
ROY: So I heard .
KAGGS: Makes no difference to me if they 're only on commission . If they do n't make good money , they 're not giving us good representation , and we ca n't afford to have them around . Ever supervise salesmen ?
ROY: Just myself .
KAGGS: That 's right , you 've had to supervise yourself . This place needs a sales manager . Somebody who 's proved he 's a salesman and can handle other salesmen . He 'd have a lot of deadwood to clea out , new men to hire . What do you think ?
ROY: Sounds like a good Idea .
KAGGS: I do n't know offhand what your best year 's been , we can look it up . The idea is , we 'll top it by fifteen percent .
ROY: What ? Me ?
KAGGS: That 's just the first year . If you are n't worth a lot more than that the second year , I 'll kick you out . What do you say ?
ROY: Well , uh No .
KAGGS: No ?
ROY: I ca n't take that job ! I mean , I mean , I ca n't take it right away . I 'm still recuperating , I just dropped in to say hello , see everybody
KAGGS: I did n't realize . Yeah , you do look a little pale . How soon will you be eady ? A week ?
ROY: But you need a man right now . It would n't be fair to you to
KAGGS: I take care of the being-fair-to-me department . Things 've gone to hell this long , they can go a little longer .
ROY: Well
KAGGS: See you in a week , Roy . I can call you Roy ?
ROY: Oh , sure . Fine .
KAGGS: And I 'm Perk . Short for Percy , I 'm afraid .
ROY: Perk .
MYRA: I do n't see why we have to take the train .
ROY: Because it 's comfortable .
MYRA: What if we want to drive somewhere while we 're there ?
ROY: We 'll rent a car .
MYRA: Big spender .
ROY: You ai n't seen nothin .
MYRA: No .
ROY: See you soon .
SOLDIER: That 's okay , do n't worry about it .
SOLDIER 2: You okay , pal ?
ROY: Let me buy you a new round .
SOLDIER: Hey , no , no problem .
SOLDIER 3: You did n't like spill much at all .
ROY: What are those , bloody Marys ? Watch this , I 'll be back .
SOLDIER 3: Yeah , but it was you like told the sergeant your grandmother was dead .
SOLDIER: Again !
SOLDIER 2: And you jumped right in . I 'll drive him , Sarge , he 's too distraught .
SOLDIER 4: Distraught ? You said distraught ?
ROY: Boy ! You guys could 've got in a lot of trouble .
SOLDIER 3: Nah . Old Sarge , he 's slowing down .
ROY: I do n't know . I would n't take a chance like that . What 's that ?
SOLDIER 2: You ca n't buy every round !
SOLDIER 3: Like our turn !
ROY: Tell you what . We 'll roll for it . Low number buys .
SOLDIER 2: Here goes .
SOLDIER 3: That 's a four !
ROY: Told you I 'd buy .
SOLDIER: It just does n't seem fair , Tom .
ROY: Tell you what . Give me a chance to get even when I come back .
DRUNK: Pretty woman like you should n't eat alone . Whadaya wan na eat alone for ?
LILLY: Go away .
WAITRESS: Right away .
DRUNK: We could have coffee together . My name 's Kenny .
LILLY: Your pal wants you .
DRUNK: Let him find his own pretty woman .
WAITRESS: This fellow bothering you , Ma'am ?
LILLY: Yes .
WAITRESS: Why do n't you go sit down ?
DRUNK: I 'll sit here . Move over .
LILLY: Oh ! Are you all right ?
FRIEND: You did n't have to do that .
LILLY: I thought I did . You should take etter care of your friend .
DRUNK: Outta here .
LILLY: I 'm sorry a lady ca n't eat in here without being bothered .
WAITRESS: It wo n't happen again , Ma'am , I promise . Dinner 's on the house . More chili ? Dessert ? We have lovely pecan pie , my husband makes it himself .
LILLY: That sounds nice . Pecan pie . Thank you .
ROY: You were right , I had to get out of that hospital . Nothing wrong with me any more .
MYRA: I 'll sign that affidavit .
ROY: Great to get away , take it easy . Next week , I 'll get back to work .
MYRA: You already went back to work .
ROY: What ?
MYRA: I watched you . Working the tap on those soldier boys .
ROY: Working the what ?
MYRA: Oh , come on , Roy .
ROY: I 'm a salesman .
MYRA: You 're on the grift . Same as me .
ROY: Myra , I 'm not following this .
MYRA: Roy , you 're a short-con operator . And a good one , I think . Do n't talk to me like I 'm another square .
ROY: You talk the lingo . What 's you pitch ?
MYRA: The long end . Big con .
ROY: Nobody does that single-o .
MYRA: I was teamed ten years with the est in the business . Cole Langley .
ROY: I 've heard the name .
MYRA: It was beautiful . And getting etter all the time .
ROY: Is that right ?
MYRA: It is , Roy ! And now , right now , it 's the perfect time , the best time since I 've been in the game .
COLE: Mary Beth ! As beautiful as ever .
MYRA: Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard , my strong right arm . Glouceste Hebbing , may I present my fine stockbroker , Henry Fellowes .
COLE: Mary Beth , what we have here , uh
MYRA: Oh , I told Mister Hebbing all about it , how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients !
COLE: Mary Beth , I hope you are n't spreading this good news too widely .
MYRA: Well , of course not ! I know how dangerous this is . But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything . Would n't I , darling ?
COLE: Well , I 'll have to take your word for it , Mary Beth . Here 's you money .
MYRA: Goody !
HEBBING: Yes , it is .
MYRA: Henry , next time , could n't Miste Hebbing
COLE: Mary Beth ! This has never been anything but
MYRA: Oh , I know , I know , and you 've been wonderful since I was widowed . But Mister Hebbing has you do n't mind my telling him , darling suffered reverses . If he could
HEBBING: Top up the tanks , as It were . Until this little glitch in the oil economy comes to an end . Not that I understand exactly what you do , not from Mary Beth 's explanation .
COLE: Well . If Mary Beth vouches for you , and if she told you the story already
MYRA: So here we are !
COLE: Mister Hebbing , we are talking about breaking the law here , I want to be sure you understand that . No one gets hurt , but the law does get oken .
HEBBING: Well , that 's what the law 's for , is n't it ?
COLE: And I do n't just mean the SEC . We could have the FBI breathing down our necks .
HEBBING: I certainly hope not .
COLE: Loose talk is the one thing I worry about .
HEBBING: I can keep my mouth shut , Miste Fellowes .
COLE: Okay , then . Sit down , sit down .
HEBBING: One of those computer geniuses , is n't it ?
COLE: You 're right ! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange . He can give us , when it 's really useful , a seven second delay in that movement of information . Do you know what that means ?
HEBBING: Well , you 've got your information ahead of New York , I see that .
COLE: Every once in a while , a majo change comes through . We have seven seconds to take advantage , put our buy order , ou sell order , into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in .
HEBBING: Not much time .
COLE: We have to be ready . We have to have the money , and we have to know what the information means , and we have to move immediately .
HEBBING: Seven seconds . I do n't see how you do it .
COLE: These machines They 're in here .
MYRA: Oh , Henry , no , that 's just boring .
COLE: Come take a look . An entire-suite of main-frame computer .
MYRA: Henry , do n't try Mister Hebbing 's patience . He knows what machines look like .
COLE: Well , if you 're sure .
MYRA: He did n't think they were risks . He was so good , Roy , he could just play with the mark .
ROY: And when he got serious ?
MYRA: He 'd explain he had to have cash , so there would n't be any pape trail for the SEC . And a lot of cash , or it was n't worth while . The least we ever took was forty thousand , and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars ! From one sucker !
ROY: I thought these people were broke .
MYRA: No , no , Roy , just cash poor . They had savings accounts , stocks to sell , houses to mortgage . Sell their wife 's jewelry . Oh , they had a lot of money , when they put thei minds to it . Or when I put their minds to it . I stayed with them , that 's the oper 's job , made them get up every penny they could raise , turn it all over to Cole .
ROY: And a month later , the sucker calls the cops and you 're on the run .
MYRA: No no ! He never calls the cops , not after we give him the blow-off .
ROY: Yeah ? How ?
COLE: Here you are ! Two rich people !
HEBBING: I must admit , Mister Fellowes , I had moments I was worried .
COLE: You brought a case ? Good .
MAN: Hold it right there !
COLE: What ? This is a private office !
MAN: FBI ! Stock fraud , tampering with Exchange communications
COLE: Oh , my God ! No ! The scandal !
SECOND MAN: Your name ?
HEBBING: My ? I do n't I only
COLE: You ! You and your goddamn big mouth !
KYRA: Henry , no , I
COLE: Who did you tell ? Who ?
MYRA: Just one or two of the girls , just , they would n't
COLE: Do n't move !
MAN: Mister Fellowes , that is n't going to do you any good . Put that down , and
COLE: You ruined me ! You destroyed me !
MYRA: Henry , no !
COLE: Get back ! Get back !
MYRA: Oh , Roy , it was great ! We were olling in dough , lived wherever we wanted , only pulled two or three scams a year .
ROY: What happened to Cole ?
MYRA: He retired .
ROY: Where ?
MYRA: Upstate .
ROY: Upstate where ?
MYRA: Atascadero .
ROY: That 's where they keep the criminally insane , is n't it ?
MYRA: No , baby . Not again .
COLE: It 's hollow . You 'll fall through .
MYRA: Cole , it 'll be all right . Honey ?
COLE: Ca n't move .
MYRA: It 's just the strain again , the stress . We 'll take a vacation .
COLE: It 's all hollow . Nothing behind it .
MYRA: Cole , you scare me when this happens . One of these times
COLE: Demon ! Demon ! That 's why you can walk on it ! Demon !
MYRA: Oh , Cole , please . Please come out of it . What would I do without you ?
ROY: I just bet you are , too . And now you 're trying to rope me .
MYRA: Join up with you ! I watched you , Roy , I 've been watching you , wondering if I should talk about this at all , or maybe just
ROY: Take a hike , you mean ?
MYRA: I need a partner , Roy . I need an inside man , and you 're it . You could be as wonderful as Cole .
ROY: I do n't know , Myra , I never had partners . I never needed them .
MYRA: Not to take soldiers for a hundred ucks . But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand ?
ROY: Sure .
MYRA: See you later .
ROY: I still do n't see why we have to have separate rooms . You expect your father to come through ?
MYRA: Separate bathrooms , darling . I will not lay out all my cosmetics fo you to knock over .
ROY: Things a man is n't supposed to know .
MYRA: You do n't mind , really , do you , Roy ? It 's been such a wonderful evening , I guess I just wore myself out .
ROY: Sure . I 'm pretty tired myself .
MYRA: I hope you do n't mind , sir . I just washed my clothes , and I could n't do a thing with them .
ROY: You I do n't know .
ROY: Oh , come here .
LILLY: Roy ! What are you doing in San Diego ?
ROY: Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend .
LILLY: If you come out to the track , do n't know me .
ROY: We wo n't hit the track . The beach . Couple a nice restaurants .
LILLY: What 's that ?
ROY: Four grand . For the hospital . Is that enough ?
LILLY: Roy , I do n't want money from you .
ROY: I pay my debts .
LILLY: You do ?
ROY: Expecting visitors ?
LILLY: No . That was the point .
ROY: You ought to put a bandage on that .
LILLY: No can do . Have to dip in and out of my bag too much . Besides , it 'll heal in the air .
ROY: No .
LILLY: I thought I was hoping we could play it straight with one another .
ROY: I guess not . You 'll be heading east from here , huh ?
LILLY: After the meet . Back to Baltimore .
ROY: Well nice to see you again , Lilly .
LILLY: You , too , Roy .
DRIVER: Here he comes .
MYRA: I see him .
DRIVER: That 's the guy we 're following .
MYRA: Just wait .
DRIVER: You 're the boss .
BLONDE: You stay down real good .
ROY: One of my talents .
BLONDE: Your mother 's calling .
ROY: Naughty .
MYRA: I went out to Delmar .
ROY: ) The track ? Did you run into Lilly ?
MYRA: I saw her .
ROY: She did n't see you , in other words .
MYRA: I 'm not trying to make trouble , Roy . It 's just , she 's always so nasty to me , I thought , who is she to be so high and mighty . I saw he out there , and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore , so now I know who she is .
ROY: You must have some very knowledgeable friends .
MYRA: I 'm well connected , Roy , Cole introduced me to a lot of people . Very valuable . Valuable for us .
ROY: Running your broker scam , you mean .
MYRA: You and me , Roy . What a team we 'll make . We think alike ; we get along together . Once or twice a year we take some slob , the rest of the time we live like this . You wo n't regret this , Roy .
ROY: Regret what ? I did n't say I was coming aboard .
MYRA: But why not ? I thought it was settled . What 's holding you back ?
ROY: Come on , Myra , do n't talk business here . This is time out .
MYRA: You mean , it would be too tough to give me a turndown here . Easier on home grounds .
ROY: Yes or no . They 're both easier at home . Okay ?
MYRA: Whatever you say , darling .
KAGGS: Yeah ?
ROY: Mr. Kaggs , I 'm sorry .
KAGGS: You 're turning me down ? Makes no sense , Roy .
ROY: I guess I 'm just not a leader of men .
KAGGS: Oh , come on , Roy .
ROY: The truth is , Mr. Kaggs
KAGGS: Perk , remember ?
ROY: Okay , fine . Perk , the truth is , I like things the way they are now . Pick my own hours , have time for , uh , other activities
KAGGS: A well-rounded life . I respect that . But it has to have a center , Roy , something you care about , something you can think about .
ROY: Maybe I 'm just not ready for that yet .
KAGGS: Well , Roy , if that 's the way you feel , I wo n't badger you . Do n't want to lose you as a salesman , too .
ROY: Oh , I 'd like to stay on . Just keep everything the way it was .
KAGGS: That 's what we 'll do , then . But I tell you what , Roy . Before I hire anybody else , I 'll ask you one last time . Fair enough ?
ROY: Fair enough .
MYRA: Darling , guess what ? I had to tell you right away .
ROY: And hello to you , too .
MYRA: I called a fellow I know in Tulsa , the one who plays my chauffeur . There 's a sucker there he says is made for us . And a boroker that just shut down , we can use thei office , not change a thing ! Now , I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble . That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end . We could start this weekend , get the sucke into position
ROY: Wait a minute ! When did this happen , that we 're partners ?
MYRA: What ?
ROY: The last I looked , we were just talking things over .
MYRA: But the setup 's there . It 's there now .
ROY: I do n't think I need it .
MYRA: You 're too good for the small-time , Roy . Move up to where there 's big dough to be made , and you do n't have to stick your neck out every day .
ROY: Maybe I like it where I am .
MYRA: Well , maybe I do n't ! I had ten good years with Cole , and I want them ack ! I got ta have a partner ! I looked and I looked and believe me , other , I kissed a lot of fucking frogs , and you 're my prince !
ROY: Do n't I get any say in this ?
MYRA: No ! Because I
ROY: That 's what I say .
MYRA: What ?
ROY: What I say is , no . We do n't do partners .
MYRA: Bullshit !
ROY: No ; history . Sooner or later , the lightning hits . I do n't want to be around when it hits you .
MYRA: What is it ? What 's going on ?
ROY: I 'm happy the way I am .
MYRA: By God , it 's your mother . It 's Lilly .
ROY: ) What ?
MYRA: Sure it is . That 's why you act so funny around each other .
ROY: What 's that ?
MYRA: Do n't act so goddamned innocent ! You and your own mother , gah ! You like to go back where you been , huh ?
ROY: You watch that mouth .
MYRA: I 'm wise to you , I should have seen it before , you rotten son of a itch . How is it , huh ? How do you like
ROY: How do you like this ?
MYRA: STOP ! !
ROY: That 's not like me . I do n't do violence .
MYRA: And you do n't even know it .
LILLY: Yes ?
ROY: Lilly , I 've got a couple things to think about . Well , kind of jo offers , kind of . Different ways to go . I 'd kind of like to talk them out , you know ? Maybe just hea myself talk .
LILLY: Well , sure , Roy . You want me to drive up ? Okay , fine , come on down . It wo n't be a home-cooked meal , you know .
ROY: Well , that 's good news .
LILLY: Roy ?
IRV: Lilly , listen , it 's Irv . You were always decent with me , I 'm taking a hell of a chance here . Somebody blew you out with Bobo . The car full of money . He 's Lilly ?
ROY: Damn .
THUG: Somebody spooked her .
SECOND THUG: White Chrysler .
THUG: Full of cash .
ROY: Thanks a lot , Lilly .
CLERK: Evening . Welcome to Phoenix .
LILLY: Good evening . I 'd like a single fo tonight .
CLERK: Oh , everything 's the same size , same price .
LILLY: I 'm a very light sleeper , traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night .
CLERK: Those trucks . I know exactly what you mean .
LILLY: Do you have something around back , facing away from the road ?
CLERK: I 'll put you in one thirty-one . Very quiet . Faces the desert .
LILLY: Sounds perfect . I can park my ca ack there ?
CLERK: Right in front of the room .
LILLY: Fine .
CLERK: No problem . My husband gets up the crack of dawn . It 's his kidneys .
MYRA: No . I 'm me .
CLERK: I 'll give you one oh seven . That 's a very nice room , very handy , in the front , right by the pool .
MYRA: Oh , do n't you have something around ack , where it 's quieter ?
CLERK: Everybody wants the back tonight .
MYRA: I guess everybody wants privacy .
PIERSON: Roy Dillon ?
ROY: Yes ?
PIERSON: Lieutenant Pierson , Phoenix police . I have a car here .
ROY: Thank you .
PIERSON: I realize this is a shock .
ROY: Well , mostly , I do n't believe it .
PIERSON: That 's natural .
ROY: No . I mean , I do n't believe it . Lilly is not a suicide . I know my mother , nothing would make he check out .
PIERSON: I 'm sorry , it was her all right . Her gun , even .
ROY: Gun ?
PIERSON: I grant you , it 's a little odd , shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it , but it was hers , all right . It really is you mother , Mister Dillon .
ROY: It may be Lilly , but it is n't suicide .
PIERSON: Do you have any particular reason to say that ?
ROY: My mother Well , I guess it does n't matter now . She worked fo gamblers . She always knew they might turn on her some day .
PIERSON: A hit , you mean . Honestly , it does n't have that feel to it , but I 'll certainly consider the possibility . Thank you for telling me .
ROY: Not that it matters . This is the morgue ?
PIERSON: You up to it now ?
ROY: Sure . Let 's get it over .
PIERSON: One thing I have to caution you about . A gunshot wound
ROY: Yes , I know , I know .
PIERSON: Well , uh , you know , she ate the gun .
ROY: What ?
PIERSON: I 'm sorry , that 's an unfortunate phrase , it slipped out , I 'm , to tell you the truth , Mr. Dillon , this is n't an everyday occurrence around here .
ROY: Ate the gun . Oh .
PIERSON: Someone who knows her well could still identify her , that 's not the problem . It 's just there 's , uh , it 's likely to be a shock .
ROY: Well , let 's get the shock ove with .
PIERSON: Not many .
ROY: Oh , Jesus .
PIERSON: No question , huh ?
ROY: No , its Why did she ?
SIMMS: The last modern thing I liked was the miniskirt . Your technology , now , nobody understands it , and that 's the simple fact of the situation .
LILLY: Oh ! Roy ! You scared me .
ROY: Going somewhere ?
LILLY: Somewhere else , that 's for sure .
ROY: I just came back from Phoenix .
LILLY: Oh , yeah ? Is the frame holding ?
ROY: Looks very solid , Lilly . Sit down . Take a minute , tell me about it .
LILLY: I 've really got to
ROY: You 're dead , Lilly , it worked .
LILLY: Not for long . Not when they do a fingerprint check .
ROY: Why should they ? The cops are satisfied .
LILLY: Bobo wo n't be . He 'll spend the money to make sure .
ROY: Even so . You still got time . Relax a minute , tell me what happened . Sit down .
LILLY: Just for a minute .
ROY: Myra followed you , huh ?
LILLY: She must have been the one that lew me off with Bobo . I guess to get me running . Did you tell he about my stash ?
ROY: No .
LILLY: No , you would n't . That 's what she was after , though . But why hit on me ?
ROY: I would n't go in on a deal with her . She blamed you for it .
LILLY: As though you do what I say .
ROY: That 's pretty funny , all right . What happened in Phoenix ?
LILLY: Roy , it was terrible . You read about people killing people and all that , but when it happens , my God .
ROY: This way 's perfect .
LILLY: It is , is n't it ? And maybe it 's a eak for me after all . I 've been wanting out of the racket for years , and now I 'm out . I can make a clean start , and
ROY: You 've already made a start . Does n't look that clean , though .
LILLY: I 'm sorry . I hated to take you money , but
ROY: Do n't be sorry . You 're not taking it .
LILLY: I need this , Roy . I ca n't run without money , and if I ca n't run I 'm dead .
ROY: You must have some money .
LILLY: Just a few bucks .
ROY: And Myra 's stuff ?
LILLY: Her credit cards . How far am I gon na get with that ?
ROY: Far enough . Maybe up to San Francisco . Or St. Louis , someplace new . Start over .
LILLY: At what ?
ROY: You 're smart , Lilly , and you 're good-looking . You wo n't have any trouble finding a job .
LILLY: A job ? I 've never had a legit jo in my life !
ROY: Well , you 're gon na start , if you hope to live through this . A square job and a quiet life . You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo 's boys will be all over you .
LILLY: Roy , I know what to do with myself ! It 's a big world out there .
ROY: Not any more . Lilly , listen , I 'm giving you good advice . I 'm following it myself .
LILLY: What ?
ROY: I thought it over , and you were ight . You wanted me out of the ackets , and now
LILLY: Roy , that 's fine , but I do n't have time for this . Bobo
ROY: I thought you 'd be happy for me . After all , you
LILLY: Bobo is n't after you ! Bobo 's afte me , and he 's goddamn good ! But so am I. I 'm a survivor , Roy . I survive .
ROY: I know you do , so that 's why
LILLY: And to survive , my way , I need money . Bobo knows about the stash in the car , so I did n't dare touch it , not if Lilly Dillon 's dead . So that leaves this .
ROY: No .
LILLY: You want a drink ?
ROY: I do n't think so . You probably should n't either .
LILLY: No , but I 'm goddamn thirsty . Ice water ?
ROY: Yeah , sure , that sounds nice .
LILLY: I 'll get it .
ROY: You would n't do that .
LILLY: You do n't know what I 'd do , Roy . You have no idea . To live .
ROY: Oh , you 'll live , Lilly .
LILLY: I know what 's bugging you , of course .
ROY: Oh ? I did n't know anything was .
LILLY: Oh , really ? You 've got a legitimate complaint , Roy , I do n't deny that . I was n't a very good mother when you were a kid .
ROY: Not very good !
LILLY: A bad mother . By any standards . I 've thought about it , you know , from your side , since then . I know just how bad I was .
ROY: Uh-huh .
LILLY: I wonder did you ever think about it from my side .
ROY: Never .
LILLY: No , I guess not . It was pretty lousy of me , I guess , to be a child at the same time you were . Not to stop being a child just because I had a child . I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up .
ROY: What do you want me to do ? Pin a halo on you ? You 're doing a pretty good job of that yourself .
LILLY: And making you feel bad at the same time , huh ? But that 's the way I am , you know , the way I 've always been . Always picking on poor little Roy .
ROY: For God 's sake , Lilly !
LILLY: I gave you your life twice . I 'm asking you to give me mine once . I need the money .
ROY: No .
LILLY: You 're getting off the grift ?
ROY: That 's right .
LILLY: That 's good . You do n't really elong on this side of the fence , you know .
ROY: I do n't ?
LILLY: If you stayed a crook , do you think you 'd live to be my ripe age ?
ROY: I do n't see why not .
LILLY: Well , I guess I got it wrong , then . Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him .
ROY: Well , uh
LILLY: Sure , sure , that does n't count . That 's different .
ROY: Well , it does n't matter , does it ? I 'm getting out .
LILLY: And that 's why you 've got to get id of this money . If you keep it around , it 'll just make you think how clever you are . It 'll be a temptation to get back into the game .
ROY: Oh , that 's it ! You 're stealing my money for my own good ! How very motherly of you , Lilly .
LILLY: A future . The only future I 've got .
ROY: That money would n't last forever . And then what ? You 'd be back in some other part of the rackets . Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in you hands . This way , you 've got to go the square route . You could send me a card when you 're settled , I could maybe help out sometimes
LILLY: ) That 's what it is , is n't it ? Keep me down . Your turn to be in charge , have the power .
ROY: Just trying to help , Lilly .
LILLY: Roy What if I told you I was n't eally your mother ? That we were n't elated ?
ROY: What ?
LILLY: You 'd like that , would n't you ? Sure you would . You do n't need to tell me . Now , why would you like it , Roy ?
ROY: What 's that all about ? Of course you 're my mother . Of course you are .
LILLY: Roy Roy
ROY: There 's nothing more to talk about .
LILLY: I have to have that money , Roy . What do I have to do to get it ?
ROY: Lilly , Jesus , what are you doing ?
LILLY: Is there nothing I can do , Roy , nothing at
ROY: NO !
DRIVER: How was your day , today , sir ?
MARTIN: Effective . But to tell you the truth , I 've lost my passion for work .
DRIVER: Do you like the people you work with ?
MARTIN: I work alone .
DRIVER: That 's it then . That 's it . I 've always een alone . That 's why I 'm a good driver . I can handle it . See , I can think on my feet . I survive , I 'm a thinker . And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it do n't bother me . Some people ca n't do it ! Some people are ranting and aving , `` Tell them fuckin ' people to get out here and get in this car , I ca n't I want a go ! '' Where you gon na go ? You 're gon na wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night . You ai n't going nowhere . You leave your house in the morning you get ack to your house in the evening . What 's the big deal , right ?
MARTIN: You understand the psychology of the job .
DRIVER: I do . Some guys ca n't adjust to it ; they ca n't handle it .
MARTIN: No .
DRIVER: Well , let 's just say that sometimes I 'm right . Sometimes you are .
MARTIN: Sometimes I am . Sometimes . It 's only natural .
DRIVER: It 's only natural . The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis
MARTIN: Okay .
DRIVER: Because your problem is you 're bored . And you have a very big mind . I am part of what I call a brain syndicate . No reaction from Martin .
MARTIN: Up on the right .
DRIVER: And when you think of it , it 's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world , is it ?
MARTIN: If it 's not there , I ca n't proceed . Tell them .
MARTIN: Tell them that 's not my problem . I was paid for one job the cyclist not two . See you tomorrow , Marcella .
MARCELLA: Wait . I have Mr. Grocer for you .
MARTIN: Patch him through .
GROCER: I 'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts .
MARTIN: Like a union ?
GROCER: Like a club . Work less , make more .
MARTIN: Thank you , no .
GROCER: We could be working together , making ig money , killing important people I 'm willing to let you in on the ground floor .
MARTIN: And you could be sort of like a father figure to me . Grocer ignores this .
GROCER: It 's a free-market evolution . You 'll wake up to it c'mon Kid . We used to run together when you were a ookie . I do n't want to run against you . This thing 's real . Everybody 's in .
MARTIN: Not me . So do n't paw at me with you dirty little guild .
GROCER: I 'm gon na get you , kid . Martin hangs up and pulls away .
HUSKY MAN: Whatever it is that I 'm doing that you do n't like I 'll stop doing it .
MARTIN: It 's not me . Martin cocks the gun .
MARCELLA: So come on back to the old oak tree , acorns . Signed , the reunion committee . ''
MARTIN: Throw that away .
MARCELLA: This ?
MARTIN: Do n't tease me . You know what I do for a living .
MARCELLA: It 's from one of those P.O . Boxes . How was the trip ?
MARTIN: Tedious . I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail .
MARCELLA: All of it ?
MARTIN: And not show it to me . Ever again .
MARCELLA: That 's going to cost .
MARTIN: I 'll pay .
MARCELLA: They 're not happy , sir .
MARTIN: I 'm not happy .
MARCELLA: They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep .
MARTIN: He did n't .
MARCELLA: They blame you for the compromise .
MARTIN: And they want me to make up for it .
MARCELLA: In Detroit . This weekend .
MARTIN: Tell them that 's impossible . I need my normal lead time .
MARCELLA: They were very upset .
MARTIN: Would you describe their position as inflexible ?
MARCELLA: Intractable , sir . You leave tonight . Marcella looks concerned .
MARTIN: There 's nothing to be done about it .
MARCELLA: I liquidated the last account in Zurich , and split it into two new ones in Estonia .
MARTIN: Good . What else ? Anything interesting ?
MARCELLA: Mmm , not really . But you 're gon na love this one . She hands him a piece of paper . He scans it .
MARTIN: Never enough .
MARCELLA: But it 's a Greenpeace boat . It 'd be so easy .
MARTIN: I have scruples . Next .
MARCELLA: Paperwork on the Detroit thing . It 's a full dossier . Very comprehensive .
MARCELLA: You should get going .
MARCELLA: Do n't forget your identity .
MARTIN: See you next week .
DR. OATMAN: You went to school with these people .
MARTIN: Come on .
DR. OATMAN: We 've spent a lot of time discussing those years . Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared , to the thought of the thing . Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite .
MARTIN: Should n't you be taking notes ?
DR. OATMAN: Tell me about your vision of the eunion .
MARTIN: It 'll be depressing .
DR. OATMAN: How do you know ?
MARTIN: I just know .
DR. OATMAN: Say more .
MARTIN: They 'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs . made themselves a part of something . And they can talk about what they do . What am I going to say ? `` I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork . ''
DR. OATMAN: You need n't be so frank with me about your work .
MARTIN: Why not . I trust you . You could n't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege and I do n't want to be `` withholding '' and I know where you live .
DR. OATMAN: You know where I live ?
MARTIN: We 're both professionals , Oatman .
DR. OATMAN: I think what you fear Martin is domesticity . It 's the greatest fea that men have who belong to Western Culture . It 's centuries old . Like King Phillip , in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought , `` Well , would n't it be great if we hit the oad and fought oh the Saracens . '' So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rathe than stay at home with their families .
MARTIN: So you 're saying that Ulysses everything he said to his queen when he came backeverything was a lie ? He just wanted to fuck around ?
DR. OATMAN: Yes .
MARTIN: Mmm . Beat .
DR. OATMAN: And how have you been feeling about your work lately ?
MARTIN: Uneasy . Dispassionate . Bored . It 's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood . I 'm starting to think I 've been in the business too long . Last week I did a guy younger than me .
DR. OATMAN: What stuff ?
MARTIN: Morality . Oatman 's glad the session 's just about over .
DR. OATMAN: Go to your reunion , Martin . See those people and discover what they mean to you . Try not to kill anybody fo a few days , see how you feel .
MARTIN: If I get antsy I 'll kill a few small animals .
OATMAN: Now we 're making progress .
CAT: Meow .
MARTIN: Just a minute .
CAT: Meow !
MARTIN: Food soon
CAT: Meow .
MARTIN: Tuna it is .
LARDNER: You always say that . You always say that . I 'm telling you , you never met the man .
MCCULLERS: Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon , and he was there . He never saw me . But I saw him , though .
LARDNER: Lisbon ?
MCCULLERS: In Portugal , yes .
LARDNER: Here 's the news He has n't been in Portugal since '90 . I know that from the file . Why do n't you read the file , man ?
MCCULLERS: In fact , I think I talked with him , in Bonn . Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this .
LARDNER: You always say that . You always have to know everybody . Why do n't I just take the weekend off and let you kill him . Since you two are so close . They exit .
FEMALE DEEJAY: and I 'm ready for some good tunes and angry talk . Or angry tunes and good talk
FEMALE DEEJAY: The Cocteau Twins , though also a and of the nineties , will be aired due to the fact that they created their own language to sing by
DEBI: Now that 's freedom
MARTIN: What are you doing here ?
CARL: A double shift . What 's it look like ? Can I help you with something ? Martin 's head pans the room , processing .
MARTIN: I do n't think so .
NURSE: Mary , your son 's here .
MARY: I bought a new rug .
MARTIN: That 's wonderful , Mom .
MARY: What 's a revival tent ?
MARTIN: It 's a place where religious people
MARY: Marlin Perkins and Jim !
MARTIN: Jim ?
MARY: His assistant . He acted like Marlin 's son , only he was n't . At least they never said he was I bet they were lovers , faggots . Yes , gay lovers . Wild Kingdom my ass ! Mary coughs horribly .
MARTIN: It 's good to see you . I 'm sure you 're curious about what I 've been doing .
MARY: I spoke to your father the othe day .
MARTIN: I imagine that 'd be rather difficult .
MARY: Nature made him then broke the mold . Martin decides to change the subject .
MARTIN: They told me you 're taking lithium , mom .
MARY: Yes , they give me headaches . I have a headache .
MARTIN: You have a headache ?
MARY: I have a headache . You have a headache ?
MARTIN: No , I do n't have one .
MARY: You do n't have a headache . I have a headache . Mary leans in close , smiling .
MARTIN: Yeah . I guess we did .
MARY: Why do n't you return this car and orrow mine ? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride ack .
MARTIN: I think I 'll go see Debi today .
MARY: Of course you will .
MARTIN: I ca n't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her .
MARY: Take care of her . She 's a keeper .
MARTIN: Yeah
MARY: And a leader . Did n't she meet Castro on foreign exchange ?
MARTIN: I have always thought about her and missed her . A nurse approaches with a wheelchair .
MARY: Separate the wheat from the chaff and you 've got the candle cat .
MARTIN: Mom
MARY: `` What 's up doc/ what 's cookin ' ? What 's up doc ? / Are ya lookin ' ? Hey ! Look out ! You 're gon na hurt someone , / with that old shotgun , Hey what 's up Doooooc ! We really mean it ! '' Mary stops short , and squints at Martin .
MARTIN: Hey Pop You got off easy . The house is a 7-11 . Mom 's a psycho- pharmacological punching bag and I murder for cash . If you were here I think you 'd be proud . He drives off .
MCCULLERS: `` Against the wind just a young man running Against the wind let the cowboy 's ride ! Blame on it the thuuunder ! Night moves ''
DEBI: WRFN playing all vinyl , all the time . Oldies from the eighties . That was ah the Specials . Doing one of their songs
MARTIN: `` Oldies from the eighties ? '' After a long pause .
DEBI: I just play my own collection .
MARTIN: It 's nice to see you again .
DEBI: Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word ?
MARTIN: Ten years , I think . What I miss ?
DEBI: Well , let me see they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael . Main Street 's a four-laner , no left turns four to seven . I was married and divorced . And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt , New Zealand . We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months .
MARTIN: Here is now there . There is here . Their eyes lock on each other
DEBI: Those are the headlines . The request line buzzes .
MARTIN: I 'm in California most of the time . Traveling a lot on business . That 's about it , really .
DEBI: That 's it ?
MARTIN: Not much else .
DEBI: What 's your business ?
MARTIN: I 'm a professional killer .
DEBI: Professional killer . Do you get dental with that ? Beat .
MARTIN: Well , I 'm in town for a few days , anyway .
DEBI: Okay .
LARDNER: Well ?
MCCULLERS: I do n't think so .
LARDNER: Well , remember when Frysal 's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the
MCCULLERS: Nooo
LARDNER: Yes . And the Munich Olympics in '72 . A local radio station started oadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened . McCullers is not to be outdone .
MCCULLERS: That 's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff .
LARDNER: It was the PLO .
MCCULLERS: Whatever .
DEBI: Sit .
MARTIN: Where have I been ?
DEBI: More like what happened ? What happened , Mr. Blank ?
MARTIN: I do n't know exactly . I could venture a guess but it would sound like a ationalization I thought you know maybe seeing you , some friends , my house of course now a
DEBI: Torn down in the name of convenience
MARTIN: and I guess , sure , seeing you would e part of that whole equation I suppose the most important thing , eally . I do n't know . Anyway , this whole thing 's my therapist 's idea . It 's my shrink , really .
DEBI: Ohhh . You 're in therapy too , Marty ?
MARTIN: You see someone ?
DEBI: Uh , no . So you 're back now , a decade later , and you want to sort things out with me . The question now is , do I allow you access to my being ? Martin says nothing .
MARTIN: Yeah .
DEBI: Next caller .
MARTIN: Dammit . Never trust my instincts . He scans the main strip .
PAUL: Hell , I would 've voted for you , but there 's all this apple sauce stuck in my phone I do n't wan na talk about it . How the hell are you ? ! Here 's five good ones ! No trace of recognition on Martin 's face .
MARTIN: Paul ?
PAUL: You 're leaving me hanging here
MARTIN: There was no money in it . Martin regards Paul archly .
PAUL: Same thing that happened to you I stopped poutin ' there on the sidelines . Got in . Got on the team . I joined the working week , you slick fucking asshole , so why do n't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy , Paul .
MARTIN: Fair enough . Beat .
PAUL: God it 's great to see you .
MARTIN: You too .
SOUTHTEC GUARD: Well , a 'course , taxes provide you asic service police and whatnot . But our customers need a little more than just that , you understand ? This adge does n't mean that I am a peace officer .
MARTIN: So it 's not a meaningful symbol , o anything . That badge is just the adge of your company . If I look suspicious on your customers ' property well , under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to , ah To shoot me .
SOUTHTEC GUARD: To shoot you . Correct .
MARTIN: How did you get this job ?
SOUTHTEC GUARD: Well , they were hiring , and it was only a two week course
MARTIN: Wow . Paul walks the happy couple down the steps .
PAUL: What more can I say .
HUSBAND: We 'll talk soon .
PAUL: You 'll be raising your new family in a work of art . A work of art in a work of art .
SOUTHTEC GUARD: I 'm sure you 'll be very happy . All look to Martin .
MARTIN: When my time comes , if it ever does , I want a beautiful , normal place like this and a wife like you All are confused . Martin thumbs to the guard .
PAUL: Now . I do n't make a habit of pimping my friends , but there is one prime little piece of land that you must see
MARTIN: No . You drove us here .
PAUL: Yeah , but it 's still kind of eerie , is n't it ?
MARTIN: No .
PAUL: Ten years . What happened ! ?
MARTIN: I freaked out , joined the Army , worked for the government , and went into usiness for myself I 'm a professional killer .
PAUL: Thank you . Paul , satisfied , gets back on the road .
MARTIN: He sells BMW 's ?
PAUL: He sold me this bad boy .
MARTIN: How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class ully ?
PAUL: He gave me a great deal .
MARTIN: Mein Dealer .
PAUL: Hey ! Bob ! The car 's running great .
BOB: Glad to hear it .

BOB: What ?
MARTIN: It 's me . Martin Blank .
BOB: Really ? So what ?
MARTIN: Okay . See you later .
PAUL: See you at the left-a-boy-came-back- a-man-made-good party . Martin nods him off . Paul pulls away .
CARL: Can I help you ?
MARTIN: What 's done is done .
SKATEBOARDER: What the fuck , man ? !
MARTIN: Are you going to the reunion ?
DEBI: No . I 'm not going . Is that why you 're here ?
MARTIN: That 's part of it .
DEBI: Well , you 'll have a ball . You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back . The car , the suit , the watch . The look . That just leaves the little things , like happiness , character , point of view
MARTIN: It 's always the little things .
DEBI: Yep . Beat .
MARTIN: I 'm wondering how you 've been . How you are . I 'd like to catch up with you . If it 's possible .
DEBI: Okay . Let 's catch up . You go first .
MARTIN: Well , there 's not much to tell .
DEBI: I 'm sure you 've done worthwhile things in the last ten years . You 've had experiences .
MARTIN: Bad experiences .
DEBI: You met people .
MARTIN: Bad people .
DEBI: Watched television ?
MARTIN: Bad television .
DEBI: Jesus . Marty . You 're pathetic . It sounds like you need a Shockabuku .
MARTIN: What 's that ?
DEBI: It 's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever .
MARTIN: That 'd be good . Beat .
DEBI: What do you want ? The question is open .
MARTIN: I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock .
DEBI: Let me get this straight , are you asking me out ?
MARTIN: Yes .
DEBI: Unbelievable .
MARTIN: Seven it is .
DEBI: I 'll think about it .
MONTY: Baby , it 's eight o'clock . Marcella gets up .
MARCELLA: Thanks , Monty .
MARTIN: It is n't done . Marcella pauses , taking this in .
MARCELLA: This is not good .
MARTIN: I 'll do it tomorrow . Marcella considers this .
MARCELLA: What 's it look like ?
MARTIN: It 's fine .
MARCELLA: You have n't looked at the dossier .
MARTIN: I 've looked at it . Martin eyes the vent .
MARCELLA: You have .
MARTIN: Yes . It 's the same as usual . Nothing emarkable about it at all .
MARCELLA: I have to call the client and give them a reason why you 're late .
MARTIN: Tell them my house exploded .
MARCELLA: I 'll call them and tell them you 're taking your time . Being a professional .
MARTIN: Okay , call them . Fine . Oh And if you could find out why they double- ooked the job , and who is trying to kill me , and call me back that 's e great .
MARCELLA: Will do .
DEBI: Are you there ?
MARTIN: Yes .
DEBI: Pick me up at my father 's house at around seven . And do n't be late this time . Beat .
MARTIN: This night , this reunion will be an important step in our relationship .
DEBI: You 're fucking psycho .
MARTIN: Do n't rush to judgement until all the facts are in .
MCCULLERS: I wish he 'd do his job already so we could do our job .
LARDNER: We ca n't do our job unless he does his job .
MCCULLERS: Why do n't we just do his job then , so we can do our job , and get the fuck out of here .
LARDNER: Do his job ? I 'm not a cold-blooded killer .
MCCULLERS: Wait a minute
LARDNER: -Look . You want to kill a Good Guy , ut not be a Bad Guy , you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy , and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy , and then you 're the Good Guy .
MCCULLERS: So if we do his job , we 're the bad guys . If we do our job , we 're the good guys .
LARDNER: Yup .
GROCER: moving into the diner .
WAITRESS: Hi . Welcome to B.I . McCafferty 's . My name is Melanie and I 'll be you server this morning . Let me tell you about some of our specials . Today we have the `` Alfalfa on My Mind , '' ou feature omelette . And there 's ou `` Gatsby 's West Egg Omelette . '' And if you 're in the mood for something different there 's the `` I left my heart in San Franchezie . '' Martin and Grocer 's eyes remain locked .
GROCER: I want two eggs poached , hash brown well-done . English muffin for the ead . And a coffee .
MARTIN: Whole-grain pancakes . And an egg- white omelette .
WAITRESS: What would you like in the omelette ?
MARTIN: Nothing in the omelette . Nothing at all . The waitress nods pertly and leaves .
GROCER: Come on , live a little . I 'm sorry about the incident yesterday .
MARTIN: No harm no foul .
GROCER: A little misunderstanding among my associates . Beat .
MARTIN: Hard to get good help these days .
GROCER: But since we 're both here , I think it 's time to take a fresh look at our relationship .
MARTIN: I did n't get into this business to have `` associates . '' And I do n't want to join your Goddamned union . `` Loner `` `` Loner gunman . '' Get it ? `` On my own . '' That 's the whole point . Why do n't you become a cop , or something . You can drink coffee in the morning with friends ! Grocer looks a little hurt .
GROCER: Fuck you ! No scabs ! From now on , everything 's regulated ! Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself .
MARTIN: No deal .
GROCER: Fine . But we 're not going to let you do your job . Because we 're gon na do it . And then , after we do your job , we 're gon na do another little job
MARTIN: Is that right ?
GROCER: Yeah after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I 'm gon na fuck you in the bullethole .
MARTIN: Nice talk , Sugarmouth .
DEBI: Flowers . That 's funny .
MARTIN: As long as I get the laugh .
DEBI: Here . Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol . She backs into the house , and he follows .
MARTIN: You look beautiful .
DEBI: Okay Hold on
MARTIN: I 'll just help myself to a cocktail .
MR. NEWBERRY: Good evening , Mr. Blank .
MARTIN: How are you ? How 's business ?
MR. NEWBERRY: Martin , I do n't know where you 've een since you abandoned my daughte ten years ago , and I do n't care . It was good that you left , and I 'm glad you did . So what do you want to talk about ? You 've grown up a bit . Maybe I had you figured wrong .
MARTIN: How 's that ?
MR. NEWBERRY: I visualized you , in a haze , as one of the slackster , flannel-wearing , coffeehouse-misanthropes I 've been seeing in Newsweek .
MARTIN: I took the other road . I 'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does usiness with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation . I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone . And you ?
MR. NEWBERRY: Oh , you know me , Martin . I 'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer , exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State . But why do n't we have a drink and forget the whole thing ?
MARTIN: Why not ?
MR. NEWBERRY: So what are you doing with your life now , son ?
MARTIN: I 'm a professional killer .
MR. NEWBERRY: That 's good .
MARTIN: Do you want to get a drink first ?
DEBI: I think they 'll probably have booze there .
MARTIN: Right .
DEBI: Okay
MARTIN: Well , I did n't kill anyone , but someone tried to kill me and the guy in the middle got killed . So if I see that guy again I 'm definitely going to kill him , but I wo n't kill anyone else . Oh , except for the guy I was sent here to kill . I do n't know
DR. OATMAN: What else ? Say more .
MARTIN: Saw my mom I 'm with Debi , and I 'm on my way to the reunion .
DR. OATMAN: Okay . Repeat this after me .
MARTIN: Out Loud ?
DR. OATMAN: Take a deep breath and realize , that this is me breathing .
MARTIN: This is me breating . Martin takes in a few breaths .
MARITN: Alright , look . I got ta go .
DR. OATMAN: And do n't kill anyone .
MARTIN: Right . Do n't kill anyone
LARDNER: He 's falling for her . Look at him .
MCCULLERS: He using her .
LARDNER: You 're wrong . Look at his face .
MCCULLERS: One can not love and kill .
LARDNER: I love . I kill .
MARTIN: Shoulda brought my gun .
DEBI: What ? He pulls himself off the car and heads toward
ARLENE: Welcome back ! I 'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph .
MARTIN: I 'm Martin Blank .
DEBI: Debi Newberry .
ARLENE: Marty , you have n't changed a bit !
MARTIN: Do n't say that .
ARLENE: We had pictures put on , that way everybody knows who everybody was !
MARTIN: Wonderful .
ARLENE: So , what are you doing now ?
MARTIN: Whatever I can get away with .
ARLENE: Is n't it cute . It 's so everybody knows who everybody was !
BATENDER: What can I make you ?
MARTIN: Beer .
KEN: Hello Martin . How have you been ?
MARTIN: Not bad . You ?
KEN: Hello , Bob .
MARTIN: Hey , Bob .
KEN: I 'm an attorney . I 'm with Moss , Brice & Fromeyer .
MARTIN: That sounds pretty interesting
KEN: Sometimes . I 'm in divorce , mainly . Some property . Some personal injury .
MARTIN: Those all seem kind of related
KEN: Here . Take my card . Wait a minute here 's a special one . For top-shelf clients .
MARTIN: Thanks .
TERRY: I do n't know , Blank , all these fucking people , driving me crazy . Look at them over there , memorializing old times , acting all like it was something `` life-changing . '' And the people in the National Honor Society ? The name tags ? Martin shrugs .
MARTIN: Why are you here Terry ? Terry turns on a dime .
TERRY: I wanted to see a couple people . But I do n't want to talk about the old days What did we have together , Martin ? Typing ?
MARTIN: Drafting .
TERRY: Yeah , I could n't stand that fucking class . But I appreciate you helping me out , man .
MARTIN: Do n't mention it .
TERRY: Yeah , thanks . Well I 'm going to try and get out of here , man . I 'll see you later . Terry slinks off .
DAN: Bob . Bob Destephano .
BOB: What ?
DAN: I 'm Dan . Dan Koretzky .
BOB: Computer guy .
DAN: Yeah Hey , I saw you at your dad 's dealership the other day .
BOB: I sell BMW 's . What do you do ?
DAN: Not much , actually . My software company just went public so I 'm just hanging out , really .
BOB: Remember high school ?
DAN: Sure . Listen . Why do n't you join us up in the grandstands ?
MIKE: You got ta hold the fans esponsible , though , Dennis , because they 're the ones putting up with the mediocre product .
DENNIS: I guess , though , you know , if you look at it Mike , that park is a eautiful park , I 've gone to that park many times - I 've had the greatest time of my life at that allpark and let 's face it , I tell you this , Mike , by the sixth inning , if you 're having the fun you should e having at Tigers Stadium , you do n't even know what the hell 's going on anyway They both crack up at this .
DARIUS: Have you two been together since high school ?
DEBI: No
MARTIN: Yes . Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue Debi 's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna
DEBI: We have n't seen each other since high school .
DARIUS: I figured . You two look too happy together . I should n't say that though , I 'm married So , Martin what are you up to these days ? What do you do for a living ? Debi perks up ; this should be interesting .
MARTIN: I 'm in pro-active international elations . It 's a very specialized company . We execute economic investment opportunities . Sort of economic clean-up with an emphasis on personnel . It 's boring , you know , it 's boring . I do n't like to talk about it because I do n't think what a man does necessarily reflects who he is
DARIUS: Sounds complicated , Martin . Are you happy ?
MARTIN: I just have to close this one last account . I 'd like to just stop now , today , but I ca n't It 's a step in the right direction .
DEBI: I do n't know , Martin . It sounds like you 're feeling compromised . Live the way you want . The only thing that 's inexcusable , to me , is cynicism . That 's the biggest cop-out there is .
AMY: But wait . I still do n't understand what you do .
MARTIN: I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken . Debi suppresses a laugh .
AMY: You do not .
MARTIN: Yes I do .
AMY: You do n't
MARTIN: In the corporate offices .
AMY: Oh really ?
MARTIN: Yeah
AMY: What do you do ?
MARTIN: I sell biscuits to the Southland .
AMY: You do not .
MARTIN: It 's what I do .
AMY: You 're so funny
MARTIN: I sell biscuits and gravy all ove the Southland
AMY: Stop it
MARTIN: You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets ? I move all of those
AMY: No .
MARTIN: Sometimes we sell them to McDonald 's and just change them to special arbecue sauce .
DENNIS: What do you think about black coaching in the NFL , Darius ? Because I think it 's great .
DARIUS: I do n't pay much attention to football .
MIKE: I have to agree with you Dennis . It 's good to see that the owners are willing to put the franchise behind a black head coach or QB when fo years in the league they 've been kept out of the thinking positions and relegated mainly to the physical game .
DENNIS: But now , you see , you have Warren Moon at the helm , Cunningham , Art Shell , and the coach up at Minnesota
MIKE: Dennis Green . And if you remember , Doug Williams was the first black man to prove that on a Superbowl Sunday . Amy leans in to Martin .
AMY: I 'm teaching art at Cedar Junio High School .
DENNIS: Yeah , listen . Where do you stand on this whole Louis Farrakhan issue ?
DARIUS: I 'm a De Klerk man myself . Debi nods , indicating to the deejay stand .
DEBI: I 'm going over to play some tunes . Martin watches her walk away .
DAN: Look at her . There it is . Jenny Slater . The finest thing that eve walked these halls .
DEBI: Which would you rather ?
MARTIN: Okay Would you rather commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month , or make love to a otter on crank for a week ?
DEBI: Soft . I 'll take the junkie otter , clearly ! I 'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants Okay . Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller
MARTIN: She 's not dead-
DEBI: It 's just a game ! Alright . Candied Diller , or wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth ?
MARTIN: Wow . I have to give this some thought .
DEBI: No time .
MARTIN: Okay , then . Clearly candied Diller .
STACEY: Marty ! Debi ! How are you ! So many people came , but I never expected to see you Marty . Or you Debi I mean because of what you divorce I did n't mean to say that . I just meant you look so good .
DEBI: Thank you .
STACEY: Do you think you could play `` Too Shy ' '' by Kaja Goo Goo ?
DEBI: Stacey , why do n't you come up here and take over for a little while ?
STACEY: I 'd love to .
DEBI: Everybody thinks they know me now that I 'm divorced . She leads Martin toward the exit .
MARTIN: Even though I left , you never left me . Not just memory but a substance in my blood .
DEBI: Like heroin ?
MARTIN: Too junky-kitschy . Deeper , deeper .
DEBI: Like love ?
MARTIN: Could be . The physical substance of love . Debi stops .
DEBI: I 'll accept that . Follow me .
MCCULLERS: Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us .
LARDNER: If he does our job , he 's our job .
MCCULLERS: I get it .
DEBI: I 'll be right back .
BOB: So . You and Debi . Gon na hit that shit again ?
MARTIN: Fine , Bob . How are you ?
BOB: Never better .
MARTIN: Really ? Bob crumbles .
BOB: Ahhh it 's all fucked up . Nothing adds up to nothing you work you whole life , day in and day out try to make sense of it all . One day you 're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it
MARTIN: You could 've been a contender , huh ?
BOB: Smart boy . Real smart . Let 's see how smart you are with my foot up you ass ! I 'm gon na kick your ass ! Martin steps to Bob .
MARTIN: Why would you want to hit me , Bob ? Do you really believe that there 's some stored up conflict that needs esolution between us ? We do n't exist . There 's nothing between us . So who do you want to hit , Bob ? It 's not me . Bob slumps against the lockers , deflated .
BOB: What am I gon na do ?
MARTIN: What do you want to do ?
BOB: I want to be an actor .
MARTIN: Then express yourself , Bob .
BOB: Later , Martin .
MARTIN: Have you seen Debi Newberry ?
KEN: Nope .
MARTIN: I guess . Before Ken can get started again
PAUL: What the hell happened to you ?
MARTIN: I was catching up with Bob Destephano .
PAUL: As long as you had a good time . Beat . Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi .
MARTIN: It did n't work out .
PAUL: That 's too bad .
MARTIN: I have to get my head back into my work .
PAUL: Work 's good for the soul . Martin gets up to leave .
MARTIN: When you see Debi , tell her I 'm sorry .
PAUL: See you in ten years .
MARTIN: Dumb fucking luck
DEBI: He was trying to kill you , right !
MARTIN: Yes .
DEBI: Not the other way around ?
MARTIN: No .
DEBI: Is it something you 've done ?
MARTIN: It 's something I do Beat .
DEBI: Get the fuck outta here .
MARTIN: Seriously , when I left , I joined the Army and took the service exam . They found my psych results fit a certain profile . A certain `` Moral flexibility '' would be the best way to describe it I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program . It 's called `` mechanical operations . '' We sort of found each other
DEBI: You 're a government spook ? Martin says nothing .
MARTIN: I was , but no yes I was before , ut now I 'm not . It 's irrelevant , eally . The idea of governments , nations , it 's mostly a public elations theory at this point , anyway . But I 'll tell you something , until about five months ago , I really enjoyed my work .
DEBI: Jesus Christ !
MARTIN: Then I started losing my taste fo it . Which usually means your time is up . But then I realized it was something entirely different I started getting the sneaking , dark suspicion that maybe there was meaning to life .
DEBI: Okay . Great , Martin , that 's just great . Meaning to life Mmm .
MARTIN: Like , that there 's a point ? An organic connection between all living things .
DEBI: Let me help you along , Martin . You 're a sociopath !
MARTIN: A sociopath kills for no reason . I kill for money .
DEBI: You never could have kept this from me .
MARTIN: I was leaving .
DEBI: That 's probably a good idea .
MARTIN: Will you come with me ?
DEBI: I 'm staying here .
MARTIN: What if I come back ?
DEBI: I 'll hide . She goes for the door .
MARTIN: Do n't go . She stops at the door . Slowly , she turns .
DEBI: You do n't get to have me . You are a monster , I 'm a human being . We 're not going to mate .
MARTIN: You do n't understand
DEBI: That 's because I speak human , and you speak monster .
MARTIN: `` What 's up Doc ? What 's cookin ' ? What 's up Doc , are you lookin ' ?
MARCELLA: I 'm bringing down the office now .
MARTIN: I 'll put things right . Then I 'll find you . Silence on the line .
MARCELLA: Uh why ?
MARTIN: Do n't worry . I left you a little something under your desk . Martin hangs up .
MARCELLA: All right ! !
GROCER: Oh shit
NEWBERRY: What the fuck is the matter with you ? !
MARTIN: Well , I was hired to kill you . It 's what I do , and come to think of it , I told you that , but Okay . I 'm not going to do it . Get in the car . He does . They drive on .
GROCER: That punk is either in love with that guy 's daughter or he has new found respect for life Let 's go .
NEWBERRY: Why ? I build cars ! They 're paying you to kill me ? Why ?
MARTIN: It was a cost-cutting effort . They ca n't afford a recall .
NEWBERRY: It was a leaky sunroof ! A design flaw ! I reported a leaky sunroof ! You want to kill me because of that ?
MARTIN: It 's not me ! Why does everybody think it 's personal ? !
LARDNER: We 'll go in through the woods .
MARTIN: I was sitting in my house on prom night wearing that Goddamned rented tuxedo , a corsage in one hand , a ottle of champagne in the other . So I was just sitting there , and then the whole night flashed before my eyes , and it struck me like a bullet in the head I realized , finally , and for the first time , that I wanted to kill somebody . So I figured ecause I loved you so much , that 'd it 'd be a good idea if I did n't see you anymore . But now I 'm different .
MARTIN: It 's not easy for me . I was raised to close off , to control my feelings
LARDNER: Did you see Blank in there ?
MCCULLERS: No
LARDNER: Good . For a second there I thought we were in trouble .
MARTIN: Okay .
MARTIN: There you go . I left it blank .
GROCER: Excellent . Here they come .
DEBI: This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry cause that 's what it does . Bringing you New Ones for the Nineties , a fresh new format designed to pull you out of what 's come before , and eel you into what 's coming soon
ANNOUNCER: Do n't miss the show of the season at Bilkin Community Center ! `` Brigadoon ! '' A musical for all ages ! `` Brigadoon , '' starring Carol Plummer , Thomas Canchola , Bob Destephano , and Lee Ordman ! Debi picks up the phone .
DEBI: RFN
DEBI: This will never work out . She turns to him , serious .
MARTIN: I have no illusions about the future . What is , is . We make choices . And we ecome the sum total of our choices . I can live with that .
DEBI: Other people ca n't .
HAWLEY: Christ , what a pit . Phil ''
SLEEPY: What ?
HAWLEY: It 's February first , Phil . You know what tomorrow is ?
PHIL: Oh , no ! Not again .
HAWLEY: So what 's the outlook ? We gon na get that blizzard ?
PHIL: No way . All that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us completely and take a dump on Harrisburg .
HAWLEY: Good , 'cause you 're going up to Punxsutawney to cover the groundhog story tomorrow morning and I want you back here in time to do the five .
PHIL: Jesus , Gil , give me a break , will you ! I covered the goddamn groundhog last year and the yea efore that .
HAWLEY: And you 'll do it next year and the year after , too . When I worked in San Diego , I covered the swallows coming back to Capistrano for ten years in a ow .
PHIL: You should 've killed the guy who made you do that .
HAWLEY: I wanted to do it .
PHIL: Then you should 've killed yourself . I do n't want to get stuck with the groundhog for the est of my life .
HAWLEY: It 's a cute story . He comes out , he looks around , he wrinkles up his little nose , he sniffs around a little , he sees his shadow , he d oes n't see his shadow it 's nice . People like it .
PHIL: Many people are morons .
HAWLEY: Just do it .
PHIL: What'11 you give me ?
HAWLEY: I 'll give you Rita . Rita , could you come here for a second ? I got a little job fo you .
TEASING: You ca n't send Rita out on a story like this . She 's just a cub , a pup , still wet behind the ears . Look at her . Her ears are sopping wet . This needs a Woodward or a Bernstein . It 's a ig story . People need to know .
HAWLEY: The Punxsutawney Groundhog Festival .
RITA: Gil , if it 's all right with you I ' d rather follow-up on the nurses ' strike .
HAWLEY: You can do the nurses when you get back . Just take the squeaky wheel here up to Punxsutawney and get him back in one piece . Okay ?
RITA: Yeah , okay .
PLEASANTLY: You know , this could be extremely interesting .
RITA: I 've never done a weather story efore . What 's Punxsutawney like ?
PHIL: Oh , it 's an enchanted place . A magical world . It 's the Constantinople of the whole Western Appalachian-Susquehanna Drainage system .
RITA: Do you always joke ?
PHIL: About 70 to 80 % of the time . Inside I 'm actually a very shy and sensitive person .
RITA: A lot of people around here think you 're not very sincere .
PHIL: Tell me the names of these people .
RITA: I 'll line up a crew and transportation . If you do n't feel like driving , we can all go up in the van together .
PHIL: I think I 'll take my own car . I ' m not that fond of my fellow man .
EXITING: Nice attitude .
PHIL: Nice face . Why do n't you ride up with me ?
RITA: No , thanks .
PHIL: They do n't really think of me as a weatherman around here . More of a `` personality , '' but with the credibility of a first-class oadcast journalist . Once you look at my tape I think you 'll see what they mean .
BITTERLY: I just want to know one thing did I do something wrong or are you just tired of me or what ? I have to know . Phil sighs .
PHIL: Dan , can I call you back ? I 've just been handed something and I etter get on it Okay , thanks .
KINDLY: You did n't do anything wrong , Stephanie , and I ' m not tired of you . It 's just that I do n't have time for a real relationship ight now . I told you that the first time we went out .
STEPHANIE: Everybody says that at the eginning of a relationship .
PHIL: ( gently pushing he
AWAY: I 'm different . I really meant it ! Things are really starting to move for me now . I ' m not going to be doing the weather fo the rest of my life . I was just talking to the CBS guy about a network job . I want that . This is just the beginning for me . I ca n't waste any more time .
STEPHANIE: Are you saying our relationship was a waste of time ?
PHIL: Our relationship ? We went out a total of four times ! And only twice did anything happen . It was fun but I do n't see that as a big commitment .
STEPHANIE: I had our charts done . My astrologer says we 're extremely compatible . There may even be some past lives involvement here .
PHIL: See ? So we 've already done this . Let 's move on . Next case .
STEPHANIE: You know what 's wrong with you , Phil ? You 're selfish . You do n't have time for anyone but yourself .
PHIL: That 's what I ' m trying to tell you . You do n't want to be with me . You can do better . Look , Stephanie , if I ever said or did anything to mislead you I 'm sorry for that , but right now I have to do this groundhog thing and I do n't have a handle on it yet .
PHIL: Rita ! I ca n't stay here .
MUTTERING: Prima donnas .
RITA: It 's okay . I 'll handle it .
PHIL: I hate this place . I stayed here two years ago and I was miserable . It 's like a minimum security prison . I 'm not staying here .
RITA: You 're not staying here .
BRIGHTENING: I ' m not ?
RITA: No , Larry and I do n't care but I thought you might , so I booked you at a very nice bed and eakfast on Cherry Street . Here 's the address . She hands him a card .
PLEASED: Great . That 's great . That 's the mark of a really good producer . Making the talent happy .
RITA: Whatever I can do .
PHIL: Really ? Will you be my love slave ?
RITA: Whatever I can do within reason . Would you like to have dinne with Larry and me ?
PHIL: No thanks , I 've seen Larry eat . Why do n't you ditch Larry and let me take you someplace nice ?
RITA: You mean like a date ?
PHIL: Yeah .
RITA: Oh , no .
PHIL: Okay . I get it . You 're a little intimidated by me , you 're all excited about the shoot tomorrow , you want everything to go just perfect . I understand . You just get some sleep . Tomorrow will be great .
RITA: Well , that 's something to look forward to . I 'll see you in the morning .
LARRY: Did he actually call himself `` the talent ? ''
DEEJAY: Okay , campers , rise and shine , and do n't forget your booties ecause it 's COOOLD out there
TODAY1: Phil grimaces and swings out of bed .
SIDEK ICK: It 's cold out there everyday . W hat is this Miami Beach ?
DEEJAY: Not hardly . And you can expect hazardous travel later today with that , you know , blizzard thing
SIDEKICK: That `` blizzard thing ? ''
DEEJAY: Yes they are , but there 's anothe eason today is very special
SIDEKICK: Es pec ia lly cold
DEEJAY: Especially cold , okay , but the ig question on everybody 's lips
SIDEKICK: Ch ap pe d lips
DEEJAY: on their chapped lips , right Do you think Phil 's going to come out and see his shadow ?
SIDEKICK: Punxsutawney Phil .
DEEJAY: That 's right , rodent lovers !
BOTH DEEJAYS: Groundhog Day1 SOUND EFFECT of GRUNTING GROUNDHOGS . Phil grunts at his reflection in the mirror .
PHIL: Never again .
CHUBBY MAN: Morning .
PHIL: Morning .
CHUBBY MAN: Think it 'll be an early Spring ?
PHIL: I ' m predicting March 21st .
MRS. LANCASTER: Did you sleep well , Mr. Connors ?
PHIL: Like a Roumanian orphan , Mrs. Lancaster .
MRS. LANCASTER: Would you like some coffee ?
PHIL: I do n't suppose it1 d be possible to get an espresso or a capuccino around here .
BLANKLY: I do n't really know
PHIL: Forget it . This '11 be fine .
MRS. LANCASTER: I wonder what the weather 's going to be like for all the festivities .
PHIL: My guess is it'11 be cold and overcast , high today in the low 30 's , dropping to the low 20 's tonight , but I 'm predicting that all that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us and dump some locally heavy snow , possibly blizzard conditions with travel advisories in the Harrisburg area and maybe as fa east as .Philadelphia . ( off her surprised
LOOK: You want to talk weather , you asked the right guy . He heads for the door .

NED: That 's okay . I 'll walk with you . When I see an opportunity , I charge it , like a bull . Ned the Bull , that 's me now . Some of my friends live and die by actuarial tables , but I think it 's all just a crap shoot anyhoo . Ever heard of single .premium life ? That could be the ticket for you , uddy . God , it 's good to see you ! Hey , what 're you doing fo dinner ?
PHIL: Dinner ? Umm , I do n't think that 's going to work for me .
NED: Hey , look out for that first step ! It 's a doozy ! Phil looks at him with murderous contempt .
RITA: How could he be late ?
LARRY: Prima donnas .
RITA: It 's just so inconsiderate .
LARRY: What happens to some people ? They 're born nice . They grow up nice . You put 'em on TV and - am ! Prima donnas . Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd .
RITA: Here he comes . Phil ! Hey , Phil . Over here !
PHIL: I got hung up with some jerk I went to high school with . So , did you sleep okay without me ? You tossed and turned , did n't you ?
RITA: You 're incredible .
PHIL: Who told you ?
RITA: Ready when you are .
LARRY: Rolling .
PHIL: Once a year , the eyes of the nation turn here , to this tiny hamlet in Pennsylvania , to watch a master at work . The master ? Punxsutawney Phil , the world 's most famous weatherman , the groundhog , who , as legend has it , can predict the coming of an early spring .
RITA: You want to try one that 's a little sweeter ?
PHIL: That 's as sweet as I get . I 'm outa here .
MUTTERS: Prima donnas .
RITA: That was really lousy .
PHIL: Is it my fault the little rat went south on us ?
RITA: A real professional would have handled it . You acted like it was a personal insult . Who do you think you are Wolf Blitzer ?
PHIL: God , you really take this stuff seriously , do n't you .
RITA: Yes , I do . As far as I ' m concerned there are no little stories , Phil . Only little eporters with big egos who think they 're too good for the job they have to do .
PHIL: You really do n't know me very well , do you . 'Cause if you did you could never say something like that about me . I care ! Call me a cockeyed optimist but I happen to think there 's more to this job than just getting my ugly mug on the boob tube every night .
RITA: Is that so .
PHIL: Yes , that is so .
LARRY: You ready ? We better get going if we ' re going to stay ahead of the weather .
PHIL: You do n't have to rush off , you know . That storm is 'going to miss us completely .
RITA: Nice working with you , Phil . See you around . Rita walks away , leaving him sitting alone .
PHIL V.O: I 'll call you after I see the network guy . I should be back there in a couple of hoursWhat ? 1 ca n't hear you you 're breaking upHello ? Sabrina ?

PATROLMAN: Pal , you got that moisture on your head .
PHIL: But I have to get to Pittsburgh today !
PATROLMAN: Mister , the only place anybody 's goin ' on this road is back to Punxsutawney . Phil glowers at him and shivers .
PHIL: So all the long distance lines a re down ? What about the sa tellite ? Is it snowing in space ? But I have to call PittsburghIs n't there some special line you keep open fo emergencies or fo celebrities ? Well , I 'm both eally . I 'm a celebrity in an emergency .

PHIL: No , that 's spaghetti . Neve mind . He heads for the door , still in a daze .
MRS. LANCASTER: Oh , will you be checking out today , Mr. Connors ?
VAGUELY: I do n't know . I do n't think so . I 'll tell you after I wake up . Phil exits .

PHIL: To tell you the truth , Neddy , I ' m not feeling real well . Could you excuse me ?
NED: Now it 's funny you should mention your health 'cause you 'll neve guess what I do .
PHIL: Do you sell insurance , Ned ?
NED: Bing again ! You 're sharp as a tack today . Do you have life insurance , Phil ? 'Cause if you do , I bet you could use more who could n't ? '' but I got a feeling you do n't have any . Am I right ?
PHIL: Did I say `` fuck off , `` Ned ? I ca n't talk to you right now .
BRAYING: Hey , look .out for that first v step . It 's a doozyi

LARRY: We better get started . We 're going to miss it .

PHIL: No hurry .
DESPERATELY: Everyone else is rolling ! Rita looks helplessly at Phil .
RITA: I 'm begging you , all right ? Gould we please just do this ? Phil glances down at his watch .
PHIL: Okay , let 's do it .
MUMBLING: Prima donnas .
LARRY: Rolling .
PHIL: We ll , it 's Groundhog Day again and you know what that means . Everybody 's here on Gobbler 's Knob waiting in the cold for the appearance of the most famous groundhog in the world , Punxsutawney Phil , who 's going to tell us just how much more of this we can expect .
RITA: That 's it . I 'm going to kill him . Phil looks at his watch .
PHIL: O k ay ? And here we go Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in .
HISSES: Phil !
BUSTER: He came out , and he saw his shadow . Sorry , ladies and gentlemen , but it looks like it 's going to be a long winter .
RITA: For Channel 9 News , this is Rita Hanson in Punxsutawney .
PHIL: I know there 's a blizzard , but I have to get a call through to my doctor in Pittsburgh . It 's a medical emergency . . . .No , do n't give me the Punxsutawney Fire Department . When do you think the long distance lines will be working again ? . . . But what if we do n't have a tomorrow ? We did n't have one today , my friend HelloHello ?
DEEJAY: Okay , campers , rise and shine , and do n't forget your booties ecause it 's COOOLD out there today !
SIDEKICK: It 's cold out there everyday . What is this Miami Beach ? Phil rushes out of the room .
MRS. LANCASTER: Painting something , Mr. Connors ?
PHIL: I ' m conducting an experiment .
HUMOR: . . . S o according to Mr. Groundhog I guess we can expect six more weeks of winter . It 's not very scientific , but it sure is fun . Hey , wait a second . If he 's ight , I could be out of a job ! For Channel 9 News , this is Phil Connors in Punxsutawney .
PHIL: How was that ?
PLEASED: It was good . A little smarmy fo my taste , but I guess that 's what sells .
PHIL: Could I talk to you about a matter that is not work related ?
RITA: You never talk about work .
PHIL: Do you know what I did last night ?
RITA: Do I want to know ?
PHIL: I destroyed my hotel room .
RITA: You whatl This is not some kind of rock and roll tour . We do n't have the budget for that
PHIL: No , it 's okay . This morning it was all right again . That 's what I have to talk to you about .
RITA: Phil , what are you doing ?
EXITING: I 'll be back to take your order .
RITA: Thanks . Okay , so tell me . How 'd you know where to put the camera ?
PHIL: Because I 've done it before .
RITA: I know , but the groundhog does n't do exactly the same thing every year , does he ?
PHIL: I ' m not talking about last year . I ' m talking about today . I lived it before .
RITA: You 're having deja vu ?
PHIL: Big time . Rita , I know it 's nuts ut I keep reliving the same day o ve r and over Groundhog Day today . This is the third time .
RITA: Uh-huh . I 'm waiting for the punchline .
PHIL: No , really . It 's like today never happened . I shaved my head last night , today its all grown ack . I could probably cut off my limbs , one by one , and - pop ! They 'd grow back . Just like a starfish . I probably do n't even have to floss ?
RITA: I 'm wracking my brain , but I ca n't even begin to imagine why you 'd make up something like this .
PHIL: 'Cause I 'm not making it up . I 'm asking for your help . Rita looks at him for a long moment .
RITA: Okay , I 'll bite . What do you want me to do ?
PHIL: The truth ? I 'd 1ike you to spend the next 24 hours with me and do n't leave my side for a second .
RITA: I see . You know , Phil , you can charm all the little P.A . 's at the station , all the secretaries , and even some of the weekend a nchors , but not me not in a thousand years .
PHIL: Wa it a second
RITA: Not if I was dying and you eath was the only cure ; not if having your child was the only way to preserve the human race . Just get it out of your head ecause it is NOT GOING TO
PHIL: So much for the truth .
LARRY: You ready ? We better get going if we 're going to stay ahead of the weather .
RITA: Yeah , , I ' m . ready , Larry .
EXITING: Good luck , Phil .
NEUROLOGIST: No spots , no tumors , no lesions , no clots , no aneurisms . Everything looks fine and dandy to me , Mr. Connors . Have you considered psychiatric help ?
PSYCHOLOGIST: That 's kind of an unusual problem , Mr. Connors . Most of my work is with couples and families .
PHIL: Yeah , but you 're still a psychologist . You must have had some course in school that covered this kind of thing .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Sort of , I guess . Abnormal Psychology .
PHIL: So based on that what would you say ?
HESITANT: I ' d say that maybe you 're I do n't know a little delusional .
PHIL: You 're saying this thing is not eally happening to me ?
PSYCHOLOGIST: Uh-huh .
PHIL: Then how do I know this conversation is really happening ?
PSYCHOLOGIST: I guess you do n't .
PHIL: Then forget about me paying you . A discreet little alarm sounds .
RELIEVED: I 'm afraid that 's all the time we have , Mr. Connors .
PHIL: Wait ! Are you saying I 'm crazy ?
PSYCHOLOGIST: Not necessarily . If it concerns you we should schedule our next session as soon as possible . How 's tomorrow for you ? Phil glowers at him .
AUTHORITATIVELY: Now if the moon exerts a gravitational pull strong enough to cause the tides , .then it may e theoretically possible for a Black Hole or a Singularity of sufficient magnitude to actually end time enough to cause it to fold back , on itself .
PHIL: You think that 's a realistic possibility ?
STERNLY: All right ! I think someone may just need a little visit to the Assistant Principal 's office ! Get back in your seats . The bell has not rung yet .
SCIENTIST: Well , I ' m speaking purely hypothetically .
TEACH ER: So the princess picked up the frog and kissed him . Phil stops outside the door to listen .
TEACHER: Now who can tell me what happened when the princess kissed the frog .
LITTLE BOY: Her lips got slimed !
T EACHER: Okay , come on now . What happened when she kissed the frog ?
LITTLE GIRL: The princess kissed the frog and the spell got broke and he turned into a handsome prince and they got married and lived happily ever after .
TEACHER: That 's right .
PHIL: Gus , what would you do if there was no tomorrow ?
GUS: You mean like if the world was gon na end ?
PHIL: No , I mean like if it was neve going to end . If everyday was the same and you were stuck here and you could n't get out and nothing you did mattered ?
GUS: You 're right . Everyday is the same , I ca n't get out of here and nothin ' I do matters .
V RALPH: No , he 's askin1 you a question , ya idiot .
GUS: What was the question ?
RALPH: What if nothing mattered ? ! Jeez , I know what I 'd do . I ' d j ust spend all my time drivin ' fast , gettin1 loaded and gettin ' laid . That 's it .
PHIL: That 's it . It just does n't get any better than this , does it ? Good friends , good conversation and quality brew . Drink up , oys . They salute each other and drink .
RALPH: ( fumbling with his
CARKEYS: Where you stayin ' , Phil ? We 'll drop you off .
PHIL: Hey , friends do n't let friends drive drunk . Give me your keys .
RALPH: Thanks , man .
PHIL: It 's nothing . Get in .
RALPH: Oh , hey , take a left ! Phil passes the intersection .
PHIL: No problem
RALPH: You can say that again .
PHIL: `` Do n't do this ''
PHIL: No more rules !
RALPH: No more rules !
PHIL: Having a good time ?
RALPH: I 'm having a great time !
GUS: Hey , uh
PHIL: Phil .
GUS: Yeah , Phil like the groundhog .
PHIL: Right .
GUS: Hey , Phil ? How 're we going to get out of this ?
CALMLY: Gus , you 're just going to have to trust me on this one .
DEEJAY: Okay , campers , rise and shine , and do n't forget your booties ecause it 's COOOLD out there today . Phil talks out loud along with them .
MRS. LANCASTER: W o u l d you
URGENTLY: Yes , I would like some coffee ; the weather is going to be cold and overcast with blizzard conditions moving in later today ; and yes , I will be staying an extra day .
BAFFLED: Why thank you .
PHIL: Mrs. Lancaster , has anyone been around here looking for me this morning ? Maybe a state official , lue coat , hat , gun , nightstick , adge , driving a late-model Ford Chevy , black and white with ub ble lights on top
SHOCKED: No , no one like that I .do n't Will they be ?
PHIL: Apparently not .
NED: Phil ! Phil Connors !
PHIL: Ned ! Ned Ryerson ! Ned the Head !
NANCY: Can you think of another reason anybody 'd be out here at dawn on a freezing day ?
PHIL: What 's your name ?

PHIL: Where 'd you go to high school ?
NANCY: What is this ?

NANCY: Is this some kind of come-on ?
PHIL: I 'm not really sure . We 'll have to see .
RITA: Is this some new fad diet ? Do n't you worry about cholesterol ?
PHIL: I do n't worry about anything anymore .
RITA: What makes you so special ? Everybody worries about something .
PHIL: That 's exactly what makes me so special .
RITA: `` The wretch , concentered all in self , Living , shall forfeit fai enown , And doubly dying , shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung , Unwept , unhonored , and unsung . '' Sir Walter Scott .
PHIL: `` There was a young man from Na n t uc k e t ``
RITA: That 's really funny . When are you going to grow up , Phil ?
PHIL: At this rate never . ( he pulls out a pack of
CIGARETTES: Okay if I smoke ? Rita shrugs . Phil lights up a cigarette .
RITA: You really do have a death wish , do n't you ?
PHIL: Just the opposite , Rita . I have a life wish . I 'm just trying to enjoy it . Taking pleasure in the little things . Do n't you eve just want to cut loose and go wild ?
RITA: I would n't even know what it means to go wild .
PHIL: Yeah , well , that 's where I come in . Going wild is one of my specialties . Last night I got completely loaded and drove head- on into a police car .
DISBELIEVING: Oh , really ? You look pretty good this morning .
PHIL: That 's my point . I know you wo n't believe me , but we could do anything we want today and it would n't matter one bit . Absolutely no consequences . Complete and total freedom .
RITA: And how . . , do we manage that ?
PHIL: You leave that to me . Why do n't you send Larry back and hang out with me for the rest of the day ? You never make it through that lizzard anyway . Larry enters the diner and spots them .
RITA: I 'll take my chances with the -weather . But you have a good time .
PHIL: Do n't worry . I plan to .
NANCY: I 'm sorry , I
PHIL: Nancy Taylor ? Lincoln High ? I sat next to you in Mrs. Walsh 's English class .

NANCY: Phil Connors .
PHIL: Yeah .
NANCY: How ARE you ? !
PHIL: I ' m great . Wow , you look terrific . Hey , listen , I got ta d o this report

MOANS: Oh , Phil .
PHIL: Oh , Rita .

NANCY: ( not entirely
CONVINCED: Oh .
PHIL: O-rita .

RITA: You look good . I mean , it came o ut all right . How 'd you know where to put the camera ?
PHIL: Psychic . So did you have a nice evening ?

SKEPTICAL: Sounds wholesome . Were those the new 24-hour disappearing tattoos or can I see them ?

RITA: Close .
PHIL: Okay , so talk to me . C'mon , I 'll uy you a cup of coffee .
RITA: I guess I want what everybody wants you know , career , love , marriage , children . So far I do n't have any of it .
PHIL: You have a career .
RITA: I have a job . Doing stories on the Punxsutawney groundhog is not my ultimate goal . No offense .
PHIL: How about the other stuff ? You seeing anybody ?
RITA: This is getting too personal . I do n't think I ' m ready to discuss these things with you . What about you ? What do you want ?
PHIL: What I really want is someone like you .

SECOND HUSTLER: Punxsutawney Phil ? Like the groundhog .

CYNICALLY: This is one of the most pitiful spectacles known to civilization . With one nod from a filthy rodent est known to pest control agencies , a moribund old coal mining hamlet turns magically into the Lourdes of Pennsylvania , Mecca to thousands of people who , if they hated the winter so damned much , why do n't they move to Florida , anyway ?
ALEX TREBECK: Nobel prize-winning co- discoverers of the DNA molecule .

WOMAN: He ai n't there .

PHIL: Coming to the end of the trail , Phil . Then we 're going out in a laze of glory .
BUSTER: Nobody takes my groundhog and gets away with it .
RITA: What is he doing ? What can he be thinking ? He must1 ve just snapped .
LARRY: This oughta be good .
BUSTER: Okay ! I know this road . There 's no way off ' cept the way we come up .
FIRST OFFICIAL: All right ! We got him now .
PHIL: Okay , pal . It 's showtime . Phil hits the gas .
RITA: I ' m sorry . What was that again ?
PHIL: I 'm a god .
RITA: You 're God ?
PHIL: No , I 'm A god . Not THE God at least I do n't think I am .
RITA: That 's reassuring . For a mintute there I thought you might be crazy .
PHIL: No , it 's true . It 's the only possible explanation . I 'm a supernatural being .
RITA: Because you survived a car wreck ?
WAITER: Are you ready to order ?
PHIL: ( to Rita , ignoring the
WAITER: Not just the car wreck ! I did n't just blow up yesterday , you know . I 've been run over , drowned , crushed , stabbed , shot , electrocuted , poisoned , frozen , urn ed , and asphyxiated

PHIL: but I always wake up the next day without a scratch , without even a headache . I 'm telling you , I ' m immortal .
WAITER: The special today is blueberry waffles .
RITA: Why are you telling me this ?
SHRUGS: Because some people like lueberry waffles .
RITA: No t you him .
PHIL: Because I want you to believe in me .
RITA: You 're not a god , Phil . Take my word for it . This is twelve years of Catholic school talking .
WAITER: I could come back if you 're not eady .

DORIS: Thanks .
PHIL: This is Ralph . Say `` Hi , '' Rita . Rita flashes a quick smile .
RALPH: Do n't believe I 've had the
PHIL: Ralph hates his life here and wants to drive around town smashing into policemen .
RALPH: Well , who do n't ?
RITA: This is some kind of trick .
PHIL: Yes , it 's a trick . But maybe the eal God cheats , too . Maybe God is n't omnipotent he 's just had a lot of practice .
RITA: How about that guy ?
PHIL: Tom . Worked in the coal mine ·til they shut it down .
RITA: Her ?
PHIL ': Nancy . Went to Lincoln High School in Pittsburgh . Takes herself out to lunch once a week .
RITA: How do you know these people !
PHIL: I told you the truth . In five seconds there 's going to be a grease fire in the kitchen . Five , four
RITA: This is nuts .
PHIL: three , two , one .
RITA: ( trying to puzzle it
OUT: Okay , enough . Let 's just sit down and think for a second . What do you know about me , Phil ? Do you know me , too ? Phil takes a long pause .
PHIL: I know all about you , Rita . I know you like producing , but hope for better than Channel 9 , Pittsburgh .
RITA: Everyone knows that .
PHIL: You like boats but not the ocean . There 's a lake you go to in the summer with your family , up in the mountains , with an old wooden dock and a boathouse with boards missing in the roof , and a place you used to crawl underneath to e alone , and at night you 'd look up and see the stars . You 're a sucker for Rocky Road , Marlon Brando , and French poetry . You 're wonderfully generous ; you 're kind to strangers , and children ; and when you stand in the snow , you look like an angel .
RITA: How are you doing this ?
PHIL: I told you ! I wake up every day ight here , right in Punxsutawney , and it 's always February second and I ca n't turn it off . If you still do n't el iev e me , listen
RITA: B u t , Phil
PHIL: Listen ! In ten seconds Larry is going to walk through that doo and take you away from me .
RITA: Larry ?

PHIL: Look .
LARRY: You ready ? We better get going if we 're going to stay ahead of the weather . Phil hands the paper to Rita . She reads it .
READING: `` . . . stay ahead of the weather. `` Larry looks at the paper .
LARRY: What ' s that ?
PHIL: Afer I got over the shock , it was kind of fun for the first year o two . I had anything I wanted . Except you , of course .
RITA: How did this start ?
PHIL: I do n't know . I just woke up . Just like always . NED RY-ERSON approaches .
NED: Hey , Phil ! Phil Connors 1
PHIL: Rita , this is Ned Ryerson . He 's an asshole .
NED: He remembers me !
PHIL: Trust me on that one .
RITA: This is great .
PHIL: No , it is n't . You hate fudge .

PHIL: I told you . I know everybody . Rita stops walking .
RITA: Did we everyou know ?
TEASING: Did we ever ! You were an animal .
RITA: Come on .
PHIL: You 're European trained , are n't you . Phil continues walking .
BLUSHING: Phil ! It 's not funny . She catches up to him . Phil turns to her .
PHIL: You were n't interested .
RELIEVED: Okay . She begins walking again .
RITA: Not that it would 've been so awful .
PHIL: I understand .
RITA: I just had to know whether to smack you or not .
PHIL: You did .
RITA: Good .
PHIL: So do you believe any of this ?
RITA: I do n't know . I do n't know how else you could know so much . Maybe it is really happening .
PHIL: I used to try to stay up all night sometimes . I thought if I could stay conscious I could figure out what was going on , o at least hang onto something from the day before . But I gave up on that a long time ago . Rita looks at him with compassion .
RITA: It sounds so lonely .
PHIL: ( trying to shrug it
OFF: It 's not that bad . You get used to it . Rita comes to a decision .
RITA: Maybe I should spend the rest of the day with you as an objective witness . Just to see what happens . Okay ?
PHIL: Yeah , sure . That 'd be okay .
RITA: It would take me a year to get good at this .
PHIL: Uh-uh . Six months . Four , five hours a day .
RITA: Is this what you do with eternity ?
PHIL: Now you know . It 's like waiting for a bus that never comes . You should see me play pool and owling , juggling , hacky sack . I can ride a unicycle . There ' s a knock on the door .
PIZZA GUY: U h hh h
RITA: MMMM . Pepperoni and olives . My favorite .
PHIL: Of course . I told you , I know everything .
RITA: ( taking a bite of
PIZZA: I don ' t think I ' d want to know everything that ' s going to happen . I like to be surprised .
PHIL: That 's not the worst part .
RITA: What 's the worst part ?
PHIL: The worst part is starting ove everyday . Tomorrow you wo n't emember any of this . You 'll go ack to treating me like a complete jerk
RITA: No
PHIL: It 's not your fault . I am a jerk .
RITA: No , you 're not .
PHIL: Okay , I ' m not . It really does n't make a lot of difference . I 've killed myself so many times , I do n't even exist anymore . I 'm just completely empty .
RITA: Or completely clean .
PHIL: If you 're going to be this positive all the time I may have to rough you up a little .
RITA: Wait ! Have we done this before ?
PHIL: Which part ?
RITA: You getting me up here , the card gam e , the pizza
PHIL: No , this is the first time .
EXCITED: Well ?
PHIL: Well , what ?
RITA: Well how does it feel to be doing something completely new ?
PHIL: Good . Really good .
RITA: Sometimes I wish I had a thousand lifetimes . One to be a great journalist . One to , I do n't know , go back to school , study art , or auto mechanics . One just to take care of all the busywork , you know , pay the bills , get my car tuned up . One to be the wild woman of Borneo . One to be Mother Theresa . Maybe it 's not a curse , Phil . It all just depends on how you look at it .
PHIL: Me , too .
RITA: Maybe , if it 's not too boring fo you , we could do it again .
PHIL: I hope so .
RITA: You 're still here !
PHIL: I know .
RITA: I thought you were supposed to disappear or I was o something .
PHIL: Not 'til six .
RITA: You rat !
PHIL: I never said midnight
RITA: You knew I was waiting fo midnight !
PHIL: But I never said it .

PHIL: I was saying that the cow was eventually returned to it 's ightful owner .
RITA: Really ?
PHIL: That 's right .
ASLEEP: I could never tell you this , but from the first minute I looked at you I wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever . iEverytime I -saw you around the station , I thought my heart was going to explode . I used to dream about us being together . In my dream you loved me as much as I loved you and we did n't have to say anything but I knew you understood everything .
PHIL: I know a guy like me could neve deserve to have someone like you , ut if I did , I swear I would love you for the rest of my life . Rita opens her eyes .

LARRY: Is he making this stuff up ?
RIVETED: Shhhhh .
PHIL: But what if the rules changed ? What if none of your actions had consequences ?
RITA: There would still be an absolute morality . There has to be an absolute good , regardless of the circumstances .
PHIL: Oh , is that so , Miss Plato ? Then let me ask you this . Where does this `` absolute good '' come from ? From the sky ?
RITA: I do n't know . From my freshman Philosophy course , I guess .

JENNIFER: I did n't unpack it yet .
MATTHEW: Maybe you should say something to the helper , what 's her name ?
JENNIFER: Yoko .
MATTHEW: Who knows ? Maybe there 's something she can suggest .
JENNIFER: Yeah . Maybe .
MATTHEW: I miss seeing this every morning .
JENNIFER: I went for a walk yesterday . Just to explore . I got lost and could n't find anyone who could speak English , who could help me . I felt so stupid .
MATTHEW: This will get easier soon , for Mom , for all of us . I promise .
JENNIFER: Or else ?
MATTHEW: Or else I 'll tell the company it 's just not working out , and that we 're going back to the States with or without my old job . They can get someone else to crunch thei numbers .
JENNIFER: Deal .
MATTHEW: Is this Yoko 's bike ?
JENNIFER: I think so .
MATTHEW: It 's been here all night .
JENNIFER: I knew you 'd forget .
MATTHEW: Oh yeah . Right .
JENNIFER: You were going to cook .
MATTHEW: I have a big conference . They usually run long .
JENNIFER: I 'll do the shopping . Just call me if you 're going to be late .
MATTHEW: Sorry I 'm late , it took awhile to wrap things up .
SUSAN: Hello ?
MATTHEW: She went out . Something came up .
SUSAN: I hope she 's not long . I 'm absolutely starving .
MATTHEW: I 'm sorry . This is a bad time .
SUSAN: Are you okay ? What 's going on ?
MATTHEW: You should go .
SUSAN: Did something happen ? What 's
MATTHEW: She does n't love me she neve loved me
SUSAN: What are you talking about ?
MATTHEW: Leave me alone .
SUSAN: Matthew , please
SUSAN: This is Suzuki-san , he 's the Real Estate broker .
MATTHEW: What did he say ?
SUSAN: He said `` welcome to Tokyo '' . And that you must be very important to your company for them to rent this place for you .
MATTHEW: Oh . Right .
JENNIFER: Even in our own house ?
SUSAN: Even in your own house .
MATTHEW: Is n't the layout great ? Wait ` till you see the back room . It 's perfect for Mom she wo n't have to deal with the stairs .
SUSAN: He says no one has lived in this house for three years .
JENNIFER: Why ?
SUZUKI: Ex-pen-sive .
MATTHEW: Where 's Mom ?
SUSAN: Mom ? Where are you ?
MATTHEW: She okay ?
SUSAN: Mom ? What is it ?
MATTHEW: It 's perfect . We 'll take it .
SUSAN: Is anybody there ?
SUSAN: I do n't know what you 're up to , but this is not cool
ALEX: Karen ?
NAKAGAWA: I am Detective Nakagawa . This is Detective Igarashi , my assistant .
ALEX: Is Karen okay ?
NAKAGAWA: She is very shaken . We would like her to stay in the hospital tonight , under evaluation .
ALEX: Matthew Williams , and his wife Jennifer . He 's Emma 's son , the woman Karen came here to see .
NAKAGAWA: When was the last time you saw him ?
ALEX: I met them when they came to egister . It 's standard procedure , though the visits were arranged by his employer . He works at
NAKAGAWA: We 've spoken with his employer . He did not show up for work today .
ALEX: Yoko .
NAKAGAWA: I 'm sorry ?
ALEX: Karen was a substitute Yoko is the girl who is normally in charge of Emma . She 's also been missing from work .
NAKAGAWA: For how long ?
ALEX: For the last two days .
YOKO: Hi , excuse me ?
DOUG: It 's okay . I 've got you .
KAREN: Running away wo n't help .
DOUG: There 's nothing to run away from , Kat . No one blames you for what happened .
KAREN: I 'm not even sure what did happen .
DOUG: You went to help someone who was , quite simply , beyond help .
KAREN: No , that 's not what I mean
DOUG: Do n't beat yourself up searching for a greater truth , Kat . An old woman passed away in her sleep . It 's sad , but that 's all it is
KAREN: Is that how they said she died ?
DOUG: I 'm sorry this happened to you . But maybe , in a way , it will help you later . Death is an unfortunate ut integral part of your future career . There 's no avoiding it . Maybe now you 'll be more ready for it .
KAREN: I do n't think I 'll ever be ready for something like that .
NAKAGAWA: I 'm sorry to disturb you , Miss Davies . I was wondering if you could answer some additional questions ?
DOUG: I 'm Doug . Karen 's boyfriend .
KAREN: Why do n't you find out when I can check out of here .
NAKAGAWA: How are you feeling ?
KAREN: Okay . Tired .
NAKAGAWA: You are an exchange student ? And you have been volunteering at the Health Center for ?
KAREN: Three months . I needed a social welfare credit .
NAKAGAWA: You said this was the first time you 'd been in that house ?
KAREN: Yes .
NAKAGAWA: About the Japanese boy you said you saw there
KAREN: Did you find him ?
NAKAGAWA: No , not yet . You said the boy had een taped into the closet ?
KAREN: Yes , that 's right . He was holding a cat . A black cat . There was a book in the closet , too . I think it was a journal .
NAKAGAWA: Did it belong to the boy ?
KAREN: I do n't think so . I think it elonged to a woman .
NAKAGAWA: I did n't see any book on the table . Perhaps someone moved it . Did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet ?
KAREN: I asked him his name . He said ` Toshio ' .
NAKAGAWA: One more question , please .
KAREN: This is him . This is the boy .
NAKAGAWA: Are you certain ?
KAREN: Yes . Positive .
NAKAGAWA: The bodies of the son and daughter- in-law of the woman you were caring for were found in the attic .
KAREN: Toshio
ALEX: Yoko ?
DOUG: I got us a guidebook to Kyoto . I thought maybe we 'd leave tomorrow
KAREN: Why did n't you tell me ?
DOUG: Tell you what ?
KAREN: About the bodies they found in the attic .
DOUG: You were recovering from a shock . I did n't want to
KAREN: The same thing happened three years ago , Doug . To a Japanese family , who lived in that house . They were all found dead .
DOUG: So you think the events are connected ?
KAREN: How would you explain it ?
DOUG: Okay . How about this the American family knew about what had happened there before , and this knowledge subconsciously caused them to repeat the same events .
KAREN: trip over the curb and sprain your ankle .
DOUG: Makes sense , right ?
KAREN: Okay . Then explain this when I went to that house , I did n't know anything about its past . But yet I still saw
DOUG: Saw what ? Karen ?
KAREN: Emma and I were alone in that room , ut there was something else there . I 'm sure of it .
DOUG: You watched a woman die , Kat . That 's a horrible thing to experience . I ca n't imagine how you must feel . But sometimes the mind tries to cope with terrible things in a way that distorts what actually occurred .
KAREN: You might be right , Doug . But I know what I saw . I think I know what I saw
DOUG: You just need to rest . We 'll get you home , get a good night 's sleep .
KAREN: Yeah .
DOUG: You sure ?
KAREN: I 'm fine , Doug . Really .
DOUG: I come bearing gifts .
KAREN: That 's the boy who was there yesterday . In that house . But this boy , he 's
DOUG: How can I believe you , Karen ?
KAREN: What ?
DOUG: Maybe , what ?
KAREN: You do n't understand . I have to , Doug .
DOUG: Why ?
KAREN: Because I 've been inside that house , Doug . Do n't you get it ? I 've been inside !
MARIA: I 'm late for work .
KAREN: I just need a couple minutes .
MARIA: Make yourself at home .
KAREN: Your husband , Peter . Three years ago he
MARIA: He what ?
KAREN: He killed himself .
MARIA: Thank you .
KAREN: I did n't .
MARIA: Then what are you doing here ?
KAREN: I think there 's a connection etween your husband 's death and something that happened to me .
MARIA: What happened to you ?
KAREN: It 's hard to explain .
MARIA: Then why would he throw himself out a window ?
KAREN: If that 's true , then why are you still here in Japan ?
MARIA: Because I ca n't leave . I tried . But I could n't . Not without
KAREN: Did you know a woman named Kayako ?
MARIA: No .
KAREN: Did Peter ?
MARIA: I do n't think so .
KAREN: Maybe it was someone he worked with ?
MARIA: Look . I 've had the police up here , I talked with Detectives , I even hired a P.I .
KAREN: Please . I do n't know what else to do . Please help me .
MARIA: This is all his stuff from school .
KAREN: Oh my God .
MARIA: What ? Did you find something ?
PETER: Happy Monday .
KAREN: Yes , I have important information for him about a case
AOKI: Detective Nakagawa is not here ight now . Can you tell me what case this is regarding ?
KAREN: His partner , Detective Igarashi ? Can I speak with him ?
AOKI: Can you tell me your name , please ?
KAREN: They 're dead , are n't they ?
AOKI: Miss , wait please
KAREN: Doug ?
KAREN: No .
DOUG: Hello ?
KAREN: Doug ! Where are you ? ? ?
PETER: Guess your mom 's late , huh ?
KAREN: Oh my God
EARTH: 1980
MEREDITH: Do do do do do do do do do do do !
MYSTERIOUS MAN: This way , my river lily .
MEREDITH: Where are you taking me ?
MYSTERIOUS MAN: I was afraid it would n't take to the soil , but it rooted quickly .
MEREDITH: Which is what ?
MYSTERIOUS MAN: Expansion .
MEREDITH: I 'm not sure what you 're talking about . But I like the way you say it .
MYSTERIOUS MAN: My heart is yours , Meredith Quill .
MEREDITH: I ca n't believe I fell in love with a spaceman .
QUILL: Showtime , a-holes ! It 'll be here any minute !
GAMORA: You do n't know what a rifle is ?
QUILL: I thought your thing was a sword .
GAMORA: We 've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast from feeding on those batteries ' energy , and I 'm going to stop it with a sword ?
QUILL: Do n't look at me like I 'm stupid . You 're the one being all inconsistent .
GAMORA: Drax , why are n't you wearing one of Rocket 's aero-rigs ?
DRAX: It hurts .
GAMORA: Hurts ?
MUTTERING: I have sensitive nipples .
ROCKET: If I finish this , we can listen to tunes while we work .
DRAX: How is that a priority ?
ROCKET: Blame Quill ! He 's the one who loves music so much !
QUILL: I agree with Drax . It 's hardly important right now .
ROCKET: Oh , sure , okayyyy , Quill . Rocket WINKS at him .
QUILL: No , I really agree with him .
ROCKET: Sure , I know . Rocket WINKS some more .
DRAX: I can clearly see you winking .
ROCKET: Damn . I 'm using my left eye ?
GROOT: I am Groot .
ROCKET: They were not looking at you funny .
QUILL: Groot , look - !
GAMORA: Get out of the way , Groot ! You 're going to get hurt ! Groot stops dancing . He WAVES at her .
ROCKET: Spit it out ! Spit it out !
DRAX: The beast 's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside . I must cut through it from the inside .
GAMORA: Huh ? Drax HOLLERS , CHARGING the creature .
QUILL: What is he doing ? !
GAMORA: He said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside , so he
QUILL: That does n't make sense !
GAMORA: I tried to tell !
QUILL: Its skin is the same thickness from the inside as from the out !
GAMORA: I REALIZE THAT .
QUILL: Gamora , there 's a cut on its neck - Rocket , get it to look up .
DRAX: Ha ha ! I have single-handedly vanquished the beast !
QUILL: Anulax batteries .
DRAX: Harbulary batteries .
QUILL: That 's nothing like what I just said . But they 're worth thousands of units a piece . Which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them .
DRAX: Sounds judgmental for a bunch of golden morons .
QUILL: That 's the kind of thing you might want to keep to yourself .
GAMORA: I 'll hold my tongue , as long as they deliver what was promised .
AYESHA: Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community , impeccable , both physically and mentally . We control the DNA of ou progeny , germinating them in irthing pods .
QUILL: I guess I prefer making people the old-fashioned way .
AYESHA: Well perhaps someday you could give me a history lesson in the archaic ways of our ancestors for academic purposes .
QUILL: Yeah , I mean , if it 's for research that could be pretty Quill sees Gamora staring at him .
GAMORA: Oh , please .
TO AYESHA: Your people promised something in trade for our services . Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way . Ayesha nods .
QUIETLY: Family reunion . Yaaaay .
AYESHA: I understand she is your sister ? Gamora roughly picks Nebula up , starts to go .
GAMORA: She 's worth no more to me than the ounty due for her on Xandar .
AYESHA: Our soldiers apprehended he attempting to steal the batteries . Do with her as you please .
QUILL: Thank you , High Priestess Ayesha . Quill starts to go .
AYESHA: What is your heritage , Mr. Quill ?
QUILL: My mother is from earth .
AYESHA: And your father ?
QUILL: He 's not from Missouri , that 's all I know .
AYESHA: I see it within you , an unorthodox genealogy . A hybrid that seems particularly reckless .
ROCKET: You know , they told me you people were conceited douchebags . But that is n't true at all .
TO AYESHA: I 'm sorry . That was meant to be ehind your back . Drax YANKS Rocket away .
DRAX: Count yourself blessed they did n't kill you .
ROCKET: You 're telling me . You wan na buy some batteries ?
GAMORA: You all right ?
QUILL: That stuff about my father . Who does she think she is ?
GAMORA: I know you 're sensitive about that .
QUILL: I 'm not sensitive about it . I just do n't know who he is . Gamora nods .
GAMORA: I do n't care if you were .
QUILL: I think you do care . That 's why I 'm apologizing . Quill watches her go , somewhat longingly .
DRAX: Gamora is not the one for you , Quill .
QUILL: Uh huh .
DRAX: I first met my beloved at a wa ally .
QUILL: Well , that is pretty hot , but
DRAX: It would make my nether regions
QUILL: All right , okay , fascinating , do n't need to hear it . I get your point , I 'm a dancer and Gamora is not .
DRAX: You just need to find a woman who is pathetic , like you .
NEBULA: I am hungry . Hand me some of that yaro root .
GAMORA: No . It 's not ripe yet . And I hate you .
NEBULA: You hate me ? ! You left me there while you stole that stone fo yourself . Yet here you stand , a hero , a Garden of the Galaxy !
GAMORA: A what ? Nebula stares at her , confused .
NEBULA: Oh .
GAMORA: Why would we be ` the Gardens of the Galaxy ' ?
NEBULA: I do n't know . I thought it was stupid .
GAMORA: Yeah , it would be .
NEBULA: It 's still wordy .
GAMORA: I was n't the one who thought of it .
NEBULA: Your name does n't matter . I 'll be free of these shackles soon enough , and I 'll kill you , I swear .
GAMORA: No . You 'll live out your days in a prison on Xandar , wishing you could .
QUILL: We got an armed Sovereign fleet , approaching from the rear .
GAMORA: Why would they do that ? !
DRAX: Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries .
ROCKET: Dude .
DRAX: Oh , right . He did n't steal one of those . I do n't know why they 're after us . What a mystery this is .
QUILL: What were you thinking ? !
ROCKET: Dude , it was really easy to steal .
GAMORA: That 's your defense ?
ROCKET: Come on . You saw how that high- priestess talked down to us ! I 'm teaching her a lesson !
QUILL: Oh ! I did n't realize you motivation was altruism . A shame the Sovereign have mistaken you intentions and are trying to kill us .
ROCKET: Exactly .
QUILL: I WAS BEING SARCASTIC !
ROCKET: Oh no ! You tricked me ! You 're supposed to use a sarcastic voice ! Now I look foolish ! Drax points at Rocket and LAUGHS at him .
QUILL: SHUT UP , DRAX ! You knew ! You should have told us ! Drax is aghast . He looks at Rocket .
DRAX: Did you tell him it was easy to steal ?
ROCKET: Are you kidding me ?
DRAX: What ?
ROCKET: You never listen to anything !
GAMORA: None of you listens ! Can we please just put the bickering on hold until after we survive the massive space battle ? !
ROCKET: Whoa . Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning .
QUILL: Do not try to bro down with me ight now , dude . I will fricking punch you in your fricking face .
ROCKET: Real nice ! Resorting to violence .
QUILL: More incoming ! MORE SHIP FLY AT THEM from the front .
GAMORA: You 're not killing anyone . Those ships are all remotely piloted .
AYESHA: What is the delay , Admiral ?
ADMIRAL: High Priestess , if we destroy thei craft , we risk destroying the atteries . They 're extraordinarily combustible and could , in turn , destroy the entire fleet .
AYESHA: We have thousands of batteries and thousands of ships . Our concern is their slight against our people . We hired them and they steal from us ? It is heresy of the highest order . The Admiral speaks into his comm .
ADMIRAL: All command modules -
QUILL: What 's the closest habitable planet ?
GAMORA: It 's called Berhert .
QUILL: How many jumps ?
GAMORA: Only one . But the access point is 47 clicks away . And it 's through that Quantum Asteroid Field ove there .
DRAX: Quill , to make it through that , you 'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe . Quill smirks .
QUILL: Lucky for us -
ROCKET: I am .
QUILL: I 've been flying this rig since I was ten years old .
ROCKET: I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft ! Rocket FLIPS the controls back to him .
QUILL: You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag . Quill FLIPS the controls back to him .
GAMORA: Stop it !
ROCKET: Quill , later on tonight you 're gon na lay down in your bed and there 's gon na be something squishy in your pillowcase and you 're gon na e , like , ` what 's this ? ' and it 's gon na be because I put a turd in there . Rocket FLIPS the switch back .
QUILL: You put your turd in my bed , I shave you .
ROCKET: Oh it wo n't be my turd , it will be Drax 's .
DRAX: I have famously huge turds .
GAMORA: We 're about to die , and this is what we 're discussing ?
DRAX: They raise havoc with the pipes . That 's why I do all the plumbing . I take responsibility for my actions . Unlike some people Drax eyes baby Groot .
QUILL: Groot , he 's right , you have to start aiming inside the box .
GAMORA: Stop it .
NEBULA: Idiots !
ROCKET: Well , that 's what you get when Quill flies .
GAMORA: There 's still a Sovereign craft ehind us ! The electronics FLICKER .
QUILL: Our weapons are down !
GAMORA: Twenty clicks to the jump .
QUILL: Where 's he going ?
FRIGHTENED PILOT: Come on , Zylak , you can do this .
DRAX: It 's not ripe .
GAMORA: Fifteen clicks .
DRAX: Die , spaceship . And he SHOOTS , BLASTING the Sovereign ship .
FRIGHTENED PILOT: You suck , Zylak . Zylak is really sad .
GAMORA: Five clicks !
QUILL: Son-of-a- ! They went around the field !
ADMIRAL: Someone destroyed all the ships .
AYESHA: What ? ! WHO ? ! But the Admiral does n't know .
ROCKET: What is that ? !
QUILL: Does n't matter ! That 's the jump point ! GO ! GO !
ROCKET: It 's a guy .
GAMORA: Oh my God .
QUILL: Groot , put on your seat belt !
DRAX: Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow !
GAMORA: Either one of you could have gotten us through that field , if you had flown with what 's between your ears instead of what 's between you legs !
QUILL: If what 's between my legs had a hand on it , I guarantee I could have landed this ship .
GAMORA: It 's not funny , Peter . We almost died . Because of your arrogance .
DRAX: They 're called Harbulary batteries .
QUILL: No , they 're not !
ROCKET: You know why I did it , Star-Munch ? Quill fumes .
QUILL: I 'm not going to answer to ` Star- Munch . '
QUILL: Dick .
ROCKET: What are we even talking about this for ? We just had a little man save us by blowing up fifty ships !
DRAX: How little ? Rocket shows him with his finger and thumb .
ROCKET: Like this .
GAMORA: A little one-inch man saved us ?
ROCKET: Well , if he got closer I 'm sure he 'd be much larger .
QUILL: That 's how eyes work , you stupid accoon .
ROCKET: Do n't call me a raccoon !
QUILL: Oh , I 'm sorry , I meant to say ` trash panda . ' Rocket pauses , unsure , looks at Drax .
ROCKET: Is that better ?
DRAX: I do n't know .
QUILL: It 's worse .
ROCKET: YOU SON-OF-A- ! !
NEBULA: Someone followed you through the jump point . A HUGE SPACESHIP HOVERS overhead .
GAMORA: I 'm not a fool , Nebula .
NEBULA: You 're a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat .
GAMORA: You 'll attack me the moment I let you go .
NEBULA: No , I wo n't .
QUILL: You 'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie .
DRAX: I bet it 's the one-inch man ! !
MYSTERIOUS MAN: After all these years , I 've found you .
QUILL: Who the hell are you ?
MYSTERIOUS MAN: I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious . My name 's Ego . And I 'm your Dad , Peter .
STAKAR: And I was like , Aleta , I love you , ut you 're crazy now , you always
YONDU: Stakar . Stakar is surprised to see him .
STAKAR: Seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable . The blue-coats turn and walk away .
YONDU: Stakar
STAKAR: There are a hundred Ravage factions , Sneeper . You just lost the business of ninety-nine by serving one .
PROPRIETOR: Please , sir ! Sir !
YONDU: You all can go to hell ! I do n't care what you think of me ! Stakar swirls toward him , furious .
STAKAR: Then why you following us for ? !
YONDU: ` Cause you 'll listen to what I got to say !
STAKAR: I do n't got to listen to nothing ! You betrayed the code ! Ravagers do n't deal in kids !
YONDU: I did n't know what was going on -
STAKAR: You did n't know ` cause you did n't want to know , ` cause it made you ich !
YONDU: I demand a seat at the table ! I wear the flames same as you !
STAKAR: You may dress like a Ravager but you wo n't hear no Horns of Freedom when you die , boy , and the Colors of Ogord will not flash over you grave !
MONSTROUS RAVAGER: First Quill betrays us and Yondu just lets him go , scot-free . Now he 's getting all riled ove nothing . We followed him ` cause he was the one was n't afraid to do what needed to be done . Seems like he 's going soft .
KRAGLIN: If he 's so soft why you whispering for ?
MONSTROUS RAVAGER: You know I 'm right , Kraglin .
TULLK: You best watch what you say about the Cap ' n , Tay -
RETCH: Who the hell is that ? !
AYESHA: Yondu Udonta , I have a proposition for you . Yondu looks at her .
QUILL: Because I was a skinny kid who could squeeze into places adults could n't , making thieving easier .
EGO: I 've been trying to track you down ever since .
DRAX: I thought Yondu was your father .
QUILL: What ? Drax stares at him .
DRAX: You look exactly alike .
ROCKET: One 's blue .
QUILL: He was n't my father . Yondu was the guy who abducted me . He 'd beat the crap out of me so I 'd learn how to fight and he kept me in terro threatening to eat me .
EGO: Eat you ? !
QUILL: Yes .
EGO: That son-of-a-bitch .
GAMORA: How 'd you locate us now ?
EGO: Even where I reside , out past the edge of what 's known , we 've heard tell of the man they call Star- Lord . He stands , handing his dish to Gamora .
ALMOST TEARY: ` Scuse me . I got ta take a whizz . Ego leaves . Quill looks at Gamora .
QUILL: Not buying it .
GAMORA: Peter , we need to take a walk .
MANTIS: I am Mantis .
DRAX: What are you doing ?
MANTIS: Smiling . I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you .
DRAX: Not if you do it like that .
MANTIS: Oh . I was raised alone on Ego 's planet . I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction . She points at Rocket .
MISCHIEVOUS: Yes
MANTIS: AHH !
DRAX: That 's called a practical joke ! She GIGGLES .
MANTIS: I liked it very much !
QUILL: Give me a break ! After all this time , and he just expects to be my Dad all of the sudden !
GAMORA: I hear you .
QUILL: I mean , this could be a trap - the Kree purists , the Ravagers , now the Sovereign - they all want us dead .
GAMORA: I know , but -
QUILL: But what ?
GAMORA: What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau ?
QUILL: Who ?
GAMORA: The wonderful television-singe man . He had a magic boat .
QUILL: David Hasselhoff ?
GAMORA: Right .
QUILL: He had a talking car , not a magic -
GAMORA: Why did it talk again ?
QUILL: Just to be a good friend , I guess .
GAMORA: And as a child you carried his picture in your pocket , and you told the other children he was you father , but he was out of town
QUILL: Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany . Why are you bringing this up now ? I was drunk when I told you that .
GAMORA: I love that story .
QUILL: I do n't . It 's just sad ! I was so sad because I 'd see the other kids off playing catch with their dads , and I wanted that , more than anything in the world . Gamora takes Quill 's hands in her own .
GAMORA: My point is , maybe this man is you Hasselhoff . I know it 's a long shot . But I lost my father as a child . I 'd give anything Quill nods , grudgingly .
NEBULA: You 're leaving me with that fox ? ! Rocket is SOLDERING the ship .
GAMORA: He 's not a fox .
DRAX: What about your spool of songs ?
QUILL: I have clones .
DRAX: What if the Sovereign come ?
QUILL: There 's no way for them to know they 're here .
DRAX: I am uncertain about parting ways .
QUILL: You 're like an old woman .
DRAX: Because I am wise ?
ROCKET: Hope daddy is n't as big of a dick as you , orphan boy . Quill just shakes his head and SNICKERS .
QUILL: So what 's your goal here ? To get everyone to hate you ? ` Cause it 's working .
MANTIS: Oh , no one has ever asked me a personal question !
QUILL: The antennae , what are they for ?
MANTIS: Their purpose ? Gamora ENTERS , pouring herself some tea .
DRAX: Yes , Quill and I have a bet .
QUILL: You 're not supposed to say that .
DRAX: I say that if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low , your antennae will feel this , and stop you from being decapitated .
QUILL: Just making clear - if it 's anything else - any other answer - I win ?
MANTIS: They are not for feeling doorways .
BUMMED: Damn . I just lost my entire life 's savings .
QUILL: Three pairs of pants .
MANTIS: I think they have something to do with my empathic abilities .
GAMORA: What are - ?
MANTIS: If I touch someone I can feel thei
QUILL: You read minds ?
MANTIS: No . Telepaths know thoughts . Empaths feel feelings . Emotions . She looks at Quill .
QUILL: Yeah , I guess , yeah , I have sort of a general , unselfish love fo everyone .
MANTIS: No , romantic , sexual love .
QUILL: No . No , I do n't . Mantis nods at Gamora .
MANTIS: For her .
QUILL: No .
DRAX: She just told everyone you deepest , darkest secret , Quill !
QUILL: What the hell , dude ? That 's a total overreaction . Drax SLAPS HIS CHEST .
DRAX: DO ME ! DO ME !
MANTIS: I have never felt such humor !
QUILL: You got to be kidding me .
GAMORA: Touch me . And the only thing you 're going to feel is a broken jaw . Mantis smiles , nods , backs away .
MANTIS: I can also alter emotions , to some extent .
QUILL: Like what ?
MANTIS: If I touch someone who is sad I can ease them into contentment , for a short while . I can make a stubborn person compliant . But I mostly use it to help my Master sleep . He lies awake at night , thinking about his progeny . Quill looks at her , struck by this .
DRAX: Do one of those on me ! Mantis touches him . He grins expectantly .
MANTIS: Sleep .
GAMORA: Is that real ?
QUILL: It 's kind of like someone put a aby 's head on a big , muscula ody , is n't it ?
TALL RAVAGER: There !
BRAHL: Ai n't so tough now without all you toys , are you ? Rocket LEAPS up onto Brahl 's face .
ROCKET: Crap .
YONDU: Hey there , rat .
ROCKET: How 's it going , you blue idiot ?
YONDU: Eh , not so bad . We got a pretty good gig . A golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself offered us a large sum to deliver you and you pals to her , so she can kill y'all .
NEBULA: Your friend . There 's too many of them . They 're going to kill him . Groot looks as if he 's about to cry .
YONDU: Pretty easy to find you , since we put a tracer on your ship back during the War over Xandar .
ROCKET: You give me your word you wo n't hurt Groot , and I 'll tell you where the batteries are .
YONDU: Lucky for you my word do n't mean squat . Otherwise I 'd actually hand you over .
MONSTROUS RAVAGER: Otherwise you 'd what ? ! Yondu scowls at the Monstrous Ravager .
YONDU: We 'll take the batteries . They 're worth a a quarter mil on the open
MONSTROUS RAVAGER: That priestess offered us a million ! A quarter is only one third of that !
YONDU: A quarter ai n't one-th -
OBLO: A quarter is four times a million ! We 're in the money !
YONDU: NO -
REALIZING: That ai n't right . I just got ta say it this one time , Cap ' n . Everyone looks at Kraglin .
MONSTROUS RAVAGER: Damn straight , lad . You 're right he 's going soft . S'pose it 's time for a change in leadership !
KRAGLIN: UH -
TULLK: Put you damn guns down !
ROCKET: Hold on ! There 's got to be some sort of peaceful resolution here ! Or even a violent resolution , where I 'm standing over there .
NEBULA: Well , hello , boys .
EGO: Welcome , friends , to my world .
QUILL: Wow . You have your own planet ?
EGO: But a trifle , no larger than you earth 's moon .
DRAX: Humility . I like it . I too , am extraordinarily humble . Even Gamora smiles at the wonder of it all . Multicolored mercurial clumps FLOAT BY .
QUILL: It 's beautiful . The tram STOPS .
EGO: Peter , consider this a token of a father 's pride .
GAMORA: Single-handedly ?
QUILL: Whoa . It 's perfect .
GAMORA: You 've got to be kidding .
DRAX: Why am I dead ? Why did you all kill me ? !
GAMORA: That 's Ronan . That 's you .
DRAX: When was I that tiny ?
GAMORA: You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit . What are you , exactly ?
EGO: I 'm what they call a Celestial , sweetheart . The Guardians STOP behind him , astounded .
QUILL: A Celestial . Like a god ?
EGO: Small ` g ' , son . At least on the days I 'm feeling humble as Drax . He LAUGHS and walks up the stairs .
QUILL: Wow .
EGO: But I was no ant to be fulfilled solely by labor . I wanted more . I desired meaning .
DRAX: Did you make a penis ?
QUILL: Dude .
DRAX: If he 's a planet , how did he make a aby with your mother ? He would smush her .
QUILL: I do n't need to hear about how my parents , you know -
DRAX: Why ? My father would tell me the story of impregnating my mothe every winter solstice .
QUILL: That 's disgusting .
DRAX: It was beautiful . You earthers have hang-ups .
EGO: Yes , Drax , I 've got a penis .
QUILL: Oh my God .
EGO: It 's not half bad . I 've also got pain receptors , a digestive system , and all the accompanying junk . I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human as I set out amongst the stars .
QUILL: When did you meet my mother ?
EGO: Not long after .
QUILL: If you loved her why did you leave her ?
TULLK: This is mutiny ! Mutiny !
OBLO: Cap ' n , help me ! Cap ' n ? ! Yondu drops his head in shame .
MONSTROUS RAVAGER: You 're the one what kilt those men y leading ` em down the wrong path . He PUNCHES Yondu .
ROCKET: I 'm sorry . Your name is it 's ` Taserface ' ?
TASERFACE: That 's right .
ROCKET: Do you shoot tasers out of you face ?
TASERFACE: It 's metaphorical !
ROCKET: For what ? Taserface thinks . Time for a new answer
TASERFACE: It 's a name what strikes fear in anyone what hears it !
DOUBTFUL: Really ? Okay , sure .
TASERFACE: You shut up ! You 're next !
ROCKET: I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry . I just keep imagining you waking up one morning , looking in the mirror , and , in all seriousness , saying ` You know what would be a really kickass name ? Taserface ! '
TASERFACE: New plan . We 're killing you first .
ROCKET: Well , dying is certainly bette than having to live an entire life as a moronic shitbag who thinks ` Taserface ' is a cool name . Taserface goes to stab him , when -
NEBULA: That 's enough killing for today . Taserface turns toward her , irritated .
TASERFACE: Thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy .
NEBULA: That was when Daddy was paying my ills . The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself . And he -
KRAGLIN: We got a whole box of hands if that one do n't work out .
NEBULA: It 's fine .
KRAGLIN: You think them Kree is gon na execute the Cap ' n ?
NEBULA: The Kree consider themselves merciful . It will be painless .
KRAGLIN: Well , there it is , best ship we got . The location of Ego 's planet 's in the nav . We 'll wire you the ten percent when we 's paid . What you gon na do with your share ? Nebula stops at the doorway .
NEBULA: As a child my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in ` training . ' Every time my siste prevailed my father would replace a piece of me with machinery , claiming he wanted me to be he equal . But she won , again and again and again . Never once refraining . Because of them , I am this . So after I murder my sister , I will uy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death .
KRAGLIN: Yeah I was talking about , like , a pretty necklace . Or a nice hat . Something that 'll make the othe girls go ` oooooo , that 's nice . ' Nebula gives him a look of pure death .
QUILL: My mother told everyone my fathe was from the stars .
EGO: PETER -
QUILL: Listen . I 'd love to believe all of this , I really would - but you left the most wonderful woman ever , to die alone ! Ego has tears in his eyes .
EGO: I did n't want to leave your mother , Peter . But if I do n't return egularly to this planet , and the light within , this form will withe and perish
QUILL: So why did n't you come back ? ! Why 'd you send Yondu , a criminal , of all people , to fetch me ? !
EGO: I loved your mother , Peter ! I could n't stand to set foot on an earth where she was n't living ! You ca n't imagine what that 's like !
QUILL: I know exactly what that 's like ! I had to watch her die !
EGO: Over the millions and millions of years of my existence I have made many mistakes , Peter . But you 're not one of them . Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be . Quill looks at him , vulnerable .
QUILL: What do you mean ?
EGO: Give me your hands , son . Here . Hold them like that .
QUILL: Whoa . The light disappears as quickly as it came .
EGO: Yes , yes - it 's okay . Just relax . Concentrate . You can do it . Bring it back .
DRAX: How did you get here ?
MANTIS: Ego found me in my larva state , orphaned on my homeworld . He raised me by hand , and kept me as his own .
DRAX: So you 're a pet ?
MANTIS: I suppose .
DRAX: People usually want cute pets . Why would Ego want a hideous one ?
MANTIS: I am hideous ?
DRAX: You 're horrifying to look at , yes .
MANTIS: Oh ?
DRAX: When you are ugly and someone loves you , you know they love you for who you are . Beautiful people neve know who to trust .
MANTIS: Well , then I am certainly grateful to be ugly !
THINKING: Poor Gamora . She can never trust anyone .
DRAX: Those pools remind me of a time I took my daughter to visit the Forgotten Lakes on my homeworld . She was like you .
MANTIS: Disgusting ?
DRAX: Innocent . Drax stares out at them without expression . Slowly , Mantis TOUCHES his shoulder .
MANTIS: I have never met anyone like you , or your friends . You are filled with such love . It is a thing I did not know existed , not like this , and I think I think it may e the very finest of all things . It both hurts and soothes the heart .
GAMORA: You 're not ugly .
ADMONISHING: Drax .
GAMORA: Why are there no other beings on this planet ?
MANTIS: The planet IS Ego . A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back .
GAMORA: And you 're not a flea ?
MANTIS: I 'm a flea with a purpose . I help him sleep . Gamora curls around Mantis , cutting her off .
GAMORA: What were you about to say to Drax efore I walked out ? Mantis looks around , worried .
MANTIS: Nothing .
TASERFACE: We 'll deliver you to the Kree in the morning . Neither one of you gon na last much longer after that . Rocket crawls toward them as they walk away .
ROCKET: Okay , Taserface . See you later , Taserface . Hey , Taserface , tell the other guys we said hi , Taserface !
TASERFACE: No , Gef ! It 's too adorable to kill . Bring it to the tailor .
ROCKET: No offense , but your employees are a bunch of jerks .
YONDU: I was a Kree battle-slave fo twenty years when Stakar freed me . He offered me a place in the Ravagers . Said all I needed to do was adhere to the code . But I was young and greedy and stupid - like you stealing those batteries .
ROCKET: That was mostly Drax .
YONDU: Me and Stakar , and the othe captains - we were n't so different from you and your friends . The only family I ever had . But I broke the code . They exiled me .
ROCKET: Slow down , drama queen . You might deserve this , but I do n't . We got ta get out of here .
YONDU: Where 's Quill ?
ROCKET: Went off with his old man .
YONDU: Ego ?
ROCKET: Yeah . It 's a day for dumbass names . Yondu SNICKERS .
YONDU: You 're like a professional asshole or - ?
ROCKET: Pretty much a pro . Why did n't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised ?
YONDU: He was skinny , could fit into places we could n't . Good fo thieving . Rocket nods , GRUMBLES .
RETCH: Lil ' feller 's all worked up ! Needs a drank !
ROCKET: Oh , man . What 'd they do to you ?
YONDU: Hey , you wan na help us get outta here ?
YONDU: That 's my underwears .
ROCKET: Yeah , I was pretty sure he did n't know what you were talking about . You have to explain it more careful .
YONDU: All right . It 's a prototype fin -
ROCKET: That 's an orloni . It 's a fin , Groot .
YONDU: You explain it this time . Rocket starts to speak -
YONDU: That 's Vorker 's eye . He takes it out when he sleeps . Go look again . Groot starts to SLINK OFF -
ROCKET: But leave the eye here .
YONDU: Why ? Rocket CAN HARDLY SPEAK he finds it so funny .
ROCKET: He 's gon na wake up tomorrow and he 's not gon na know where his eye is !
ROCKET: That 's a desk . We told you it was this big .
ROCKET: Tell me you guys have a efrigerator somewhere with a bunch of severed human toes . Yondu SUBTLY SHAKES HIS HEAD .
YONDU: The drawer you want to open . Has this symbol on it , okay ? Groot takes it . He looks at Yondu and NODS .
ROCKET: He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat .
YONDU: That 's not what I said . Groot takes it off his head .
GROOT: I am Groot .
TRANSLATING: He 's relieved that you do n't want him to .
GROOT: I am Groot .
ROCKET: He hates hats .
GROOT: I am Groot .
ROCKET: On anyone , not just himself .
GROOT: I am Groot .
ROCKET: One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head . The next minute , it 's just because you realize part of that head is a hat .
TO GROOT: That 's why you do n't like hats ? Groot nods .
YONDU: This is an important conversation ight now ?
ROCKET: No . Let 's try again .
KRAGLIN: I did n't mean to do a mutiny . They killed all my friends .
YONDU: Go get the third quadrant ready fo elease . Kraglin SALUTES .
ROCKET: One more thing . Kraglin stares at him .
TASERFACE: He 's got it !
RETCH: GO !
SCURRILOUS RAVAGER: Down there !
ROCKET: You maniac . The whole ship is gon na low .
YONDU: Not the whole ship . Yondu catches the arrow and walks out .
TASERFACE: I 'm sending you the coordinates fo Yondu 's ship .
YONDU: Release the quadrant .
TASERFACE: I only ask one thing . That you High Priestess tells him the name of the man what sealed his fate Taserface .
KRAGLIN: Where to , Cap ' n ? Rocket SETS THE DESTINATION
ROCKET: Ego .
YONDU: NO , BOY !
ROCKET: I know that .
YONDU: We 're about to do seven-hundred . Rocket looks bummed .
QUILL: So I guess this could all be mine someday .
GAMORA: Rocket ? Rocket , you there ? Dammit . Quill comes up behind her , messing with her .
QUILL: Dance with me .
GAMORA: No . I 'm not
QUILL: Come on . This is Sam Cooke , one of the greatest Earth singers of all time .
GAMORA: If you ever tell anyone about this , I 'll kill you . They look at each other .
QUILL: When are we going to do something about this unspoken thing etween us ?
GAMORA: What unspoken thing ?
GAMORA: There is no unspoken thing between us .
QUILL: Well , that 's a Catch-22 . Because if you said there was , it would be spoken , and then you 'd be a liar . So by saying there is n't , you 're telling the truth , and admitting there is .
GAMORA: That 's not Gamora PULLS AWAY .
QUILL: What are you talking about ? You were the one who wanted me to come here ! Gamora moves into
GAMORA: That girl , Mantis . She 's afraid of something .
QUILL: Why are you trying to take this from me ?
GAMORA: I 'm not
QUILL: He 's my father . He 's blood -
GAMORA: You have blood on earth . You neve wanted to return there .
QUILL: Again - you made me come here ! And Earth ? ! Earth is the place my mother died in front of me .
GAMORA: No , it 's because that 's real , and this is a fantasy .
QUILL: This is real . I 'm only half human , emember ?
GAMORA: That 's the half I 'm worried about .
QUILL: Oh , I get it . You 're jealous ecause I 'm part god ! You like me eing the weak one ! Gamora adds some pieces to her transmitter .
GAMORA: Uh . You were insufferable to begin with . I have n't been able to reach Rocket . I 'm going to see if I can get a signal outside .
QUILL: You know , this is n't Cheers afte all . It 's whatever the show is where one person is willing to , you know , open themselves up to new possibilities , and the other person is just kind of a jerk who does n't trust anyone ! It 's a show that does n't exist - it would never be made , it would be so horrible ! It would get zero ratings !
GAMORA: You 're having a conversation with yourself ! I do n't know what Cheers is !
QUILL: I finally found my family , do n't you understand that ! ?
GAMORA: I thought you already had .
QUILL: So this is how it ends , then ? Ou whole story . Like this ? You and me ?
GAMORA: Get it through your head , Peter . There is no you and me . There neve was . Quill watches her leave .
NEBULA: I win . Gamora eyes her , a little surprised .
GAMORA: Uh , no , I just spared your life -
NEBULA: You were stupid enough to let me live so -
GAMORA: You just let me live !
NEBULA: I WIN !
GAMORA: I 'm not the one who just flew across the universe because I wanted to win !
NEBULA: Do n't tell me what I want !
GAMORA: I do n't have to because you make it
QUILL: Yeah . Ego sits beside him .
EGO: It 's fortuitous you 're listening to this song .
QUILL: You know - ?
EGO: ` Brandy ' by Looking Glass . A favorite of your mom 's .
QUILL: Yes .
EGO: One of earth 's greatest musical compositions . Perhaps its very greatest .
QUILL: Yeah , it is .
EGO: You and I , Peter , we 're the sailo in the song .
QUILL: Well , you might not be mortal , but
EGO: Death will remain a stranger to oth of us as long as the light urns within the planet . Ego smiles .
QUILL: I 'm immortal ? That 's really ?
EGO: Yes , as long as the light exists .
QUILL: And I can use the light to make cool things ? Like how you made all this ?
EGO: It 'll take thousands of years of practice before you get really good at it . But , yes .
QUILL: Well , get ready for an eight hundred foot statue of Pac Man , then . With Skeletor . And Heathe Locklear . I 'm gon na make some weird shit . Ego puts his arm around him , smiles kindly .
EGO: I ca n't wait to see your weird shit .
QUILL: Wow , that
EGO: Came out a little disgusting . They CHUCKLE .
QUILL: How ?
EGO: Come with me .
DRAX: Ugh . I am sorry , but I like a woman with some meat on her bones .
MANTIS: What ?
DRAX: I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting .
MANTIS: No ! That 's not what I - Drax starts to GAG .
DRAX: I 'm imagining being with you physically !
MANTIS: Drax , that 's not - I do n't like you like that . I do n't even like the type of thing you are .
OFFENDED: Hey ! There 's no need to get personal !
MANTIS: Listen ! Ego 's gotten exactly what he wanted . I should have told you earlier , I am stupid . You are in danger .
GAMORA: What 's that ?
EGO: You need to readjust the way you process life . Everything around us - including the girl - is temporary . We are forever .
QUILL: Does n't eternity get boring ?
EGO: Not if you have a purpose , Peter . Which is why you 're here . I told you how all those years ago I had an unceasing impulse to find life .
QUILL: I see it . Eternity .
GAMORA: Oh my God .
NEBULA: We need to get off this planet .
STAN LEE: Anyway , before I was so rudely interrupted , that time I was a World War II vet -
YONDU: What the hell you doing , boy ? !
ROCKET: I could tell by how you talked about him - this Ego is bad news . We 're here to save Quill .
YONDU: For what ?
DERISIVELY: For ` honor ' ? For ` love ' ?
ROCKET: No ! I do n't care about those things ! I want to save Quill so I can prove I 'm better than him ! I can lord this over him forever !
YONDU: You can fool yourself and everyone else but you ca n't fool me . I know who you are .
ROCKET: You do n't know anything about me , loser .
YONDU: I know everything about you . I know you play like the meanest and the hardest ` cause you actually the most scared of all .
ROCKET: Shut up .
YONDU: I know you steal batteries you do n't need and you push away anyone who 's willing to put up with you , ` cause just a little bit of love eminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is !
ROCKET: I said , shut up .
YONDU: I know the scientists what made you never gave a rat 's ass about you -
ROCKET: I 'm serious , dude - !
YONDU: Just like my own damn parents , who sold me , their own little baby , into slavery ! I know who you are , oy , because you 're me . They stare at each other there , a mirror .
ROCKET: What kind of pair are we ?
YONDU: The kind that 's about to go fight a planet I reckon .
ROCKET: All right , okay , that 's - Wait . Fight a what ?
DRAX: Hey ! And she SLAMS her against the wall .
GAMORA: Who are you people ? ! What is this place ? !
NEBULA: Just watching the fireworks .
DRAX: Gamora , let her go !
GAMORA: The bodies in the caverns , who are they ? !
MANTIS: You are scared .
EGO: I call it the Expansion . It is my purpose . And now it 's yours as well .
QUILL: It 's beautiful .
EGO: Over thousands of years I implanted thousands of extensions of myself on thousands of worlds .
GAMORA: What did she do to me ? !
DRAX: She already told me everything .
EGO: I only had one problem . A single Celestial does n't have enough powe for such an enterprise . But two Celestials - well now , that just might do .
MANTIS: The bodies are his children . Gamora is horrified .
EGO: Out of all my labors the most eguiling was attempting to graft my DNA with that of anothe species . I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough to powe the expansion .
GAMORA: We need to find Peter now and get off this damn planet .
MANTIS: Ego will have won him to his side y now . He has a way of -
NEBULA: Then we just go .
GAMORA: No . He 's our friend .
NEBULA: All any of you do is yell at each other . You 're not friends .
DRAX: You 're right . We 're family . We leave no one behind .
TO NEBULA: Except maybe you .
NEBULA: Oh my god .
EGO: For the first time in my life , I am truly not alone .
QUILL: My friends .
EGO: That 's the mortal in you , Peter .
QUILL: Yes . I do n't need that .
EGO: What are we ?
QUILL: Forever .
EGO: What are they ?
QUILL: Temporary .
EGO: You think you love them . But love is merely an evolutionary trick in the service of reproduction . We are eyond such things .
QUILL: Yes .
EGO: NOW -
QUILL: But my mother . Ego looks at him , questioningly .
EGO: That I did . My river lily , who knew the words to every song that came on the radio . I returned to earth to see her three times . I knew if I came back a fourth , I 'd neve leave .
QUILL: Wh- what ?
EGO: I know that sounds bad -
QUILL: You killed my mother ! EGO TRANSFORMS into DAVID HASSELHOFF .
EGO: I tried so hard to find the form that best suited you , and this is the thanks I get ? And then , once again , BECOMES HIS USUAL FORM .
GAMORA: Rocket ? !
ROCKET: Keep that transmitter nearby so I can find you . We 're in an old piece of construction equipment Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria .
YONDU: Drop it , Kraglin !
ROCKET: I got a plan .
YONDU: What is it ?
ROCKET: It 's pretty simple .
QUILL: NO .
EGO: ` My life , my love , my lady is the sea ' ? Peter , THIS IS THE SEA .
YONDU: Hey there , Jackass . Ego looks surprised . The LASER DRILL lands on Ego , SQUASHING HIM .
DRAX: Out of the way , dumber , smalle Groot .
GAMORA: I told you something did n't feel ight .
QUILL: ` I told you so . ' That 's really what I need right now .
GAMORA: I came back , did n't I ?
QUILL: Because there 's an unspoken thing .
GAMORA: There is no unspoken thing .
DRAX: What are you doing ? You could have killed us all crashing in here like that !
ROCKET: Uh , ` Thank you , Rocket ' ?
DRAX: We had it under control .
MANTIS: We did not . That is only an extension of his true self . He will e back soon .
NEBULA: Back rubs , dishes , killing gods , whatever I need to do to get a damn ide home .
ROCKET: She tried to murder me !
NEBULA: I saved you , you stupid fox .
GAMORA: He 's not a fox .
GROOT: I am Groot .
ROCKET: I 'm not a raboon either !
GROOT: I am Groot .
ROCKET: ` Raccoon , ' whatever ! Drax looks out the window .
DRAX: How do we kill a Celestial ?
QUILL: There 's the center to him - his ain , his soul , whatever it is , in some sort of shell
MANTIS: It 's in the caverns below the surface . Quill climbs up the ladder to see -
QUILL: YONDU ?
NEBULA: If he 's got that fin back , I am so screwed .
YONDU: Thrusters are out ! Quill starts rewiring the mechanics .
QUILL: I guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid . Otherwise you would have delivered me to this maniac !
YONDU: You still reckon that 's the reason I kept you around , you idiot ? !
QUILL: That 's what you told me , you old doofus !
YONDU: Once I figured out what happened to them other kids , I was n't gon na just hand you over .
QUILL: You said you were gon na eat me !
YONDU: That was being funny !
QUILL: Not to me ! !
ROCKET: You people have issues .
QUILL: Of course I have issues that 's my fricking father ! ! Thrusters are ack up . Quill thrusts the ship FORWARD instead of up .
YONDU: We should be going up !
QUILL: We ca n't . Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it . We have to kill him .
ROCKET: Got it .
QUILL: I guess .
ROCKET: Awesome . We 'll really be able to jack up our prices if we 're two- time-galaxy savers .
QUILL: I seriously ca n't believe that is where your mind goes .
ROCKET: It was just a random thought , man ! I thought we were friends !
QUILL: And the people .
ROCKET: Meh . Mantis GIGGLES .
MANTIS: The crabby puppy is so cute he makes me want to die !
DRAX: Your suicidal thoughts sadden me , ut your wish will likely come true .
AYESHA: Pilots , release envoy units !
KRAGLIN: Uhh Cap ' n ? No answer .
YONDU: So why 'd Ego want you here ?
QUILL: He needs my genetic connection to the light to help destroy the universe . He tried to teach me how to control the power .
YONDU: So could you ?
QUILL: A little . I made a ball .
YONDU: A ball ?
QUILL: I thought as hard as a could , that 's all I could come up with .
YONDU: You ` thought ' ? Quill nods .
QUILL: What do you use ?
GAMORA: Whoa .
MANTIS: There ! Thats Ego 's core .
GAMORA: That ore 's thick . Rocket , we 're gon na need to use the big laser . Rocket nods , FLICKS switches .
MANTIS: We must hurry . It will not take Ego long to find us .
ROCKET: Keep it still !
QUILL: We drill into the center , we kill him .
YONDU: What is it , Kraglin ?
QUILL: Why are n't you firing the laser ? !
ROCKET: They blew out the generator ! I think I packed a small detonator .
NEBULA: A detonator is worthless without explosives !
ROCKET: We got these ! Rocket shows Nebula the Anulax batteries .
QUILL: Is it strong enough to kill Ego ?
ROCKET: If it is , it will cause a chain eaction throughout his entire nervous system .
QUILL: Meaning what ?
ROCKET: The entire planet will explode . We 'll have to get out of here fast . I rigged a timer .
QUILL: Go !
MANTIS: He 's coming .
DRAX: Did n't you say you could make him sleep ?
MANTIS: When he wants ! He 's too powerful ! I ca n't !
DRAX: You do n't have to believe in yourself because I believe in you .
MANTIS: SLEEP !
DRAX: I never thought she 'd be able to do it . With as skinny and weak as she appears to be . Mantis 's arm is TREMBLING .
MANTIS: I do n't know how long I can hold him !
GAMORA: You need to , girl . If you do n't keep Ego at bay , we all die .
ROCKET: The metal is too thick ! For the omb to work we 'd actually need to place it on Ego 's core . And ou fat butts ai n't gon na fit through those tiny holes .
