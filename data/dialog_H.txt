JOEY'S MOM: Joey !
MARGO: Good morning , Gentlemen . Please be seated . I see we 're still dressing in the dark , Eugene .
PLAGUE: Once again , do n't call me Eugene . A recent unknown intruder penetrated , using a superuser acount , giving him access to ou whole system .
MARGO: Precisely what you 're paid to prevent .
PLAGUE: Someone did n't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords . Now , as I so meticulously pointed out , the fo most used passwords are love , sex , secret and God . So would your holiness care to change her password ? Margo just blinks prettily .
MARGO: Virus ?
PLAGUE: Yesterday , the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty , and flooded its tanks .
MARGO: Excuse me ?
PLAGUE: The little boat flipped over . A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed esponsibility .
MARGO: What , it left a note ?
BOARD MEMBER: Is that
PLAGUE: That is the virus . Leonardo da Vinci . The
DUKE ELLINGSON: Well then , put the ships ' ballasts unde manual control .
PLAGUE: There 's no such thing anymore , Duke . These ships are totally computerized . They rely on satellite navigation , which links them to ou network , and the virus , wherever they are in the world .
MARGO: So what are we supposed to do ?
PLAGUE: Well luckily , you have a gifted and talented security officer . I traced the hacker 's call .
SUIT #1: Now look , now we expect you to get onto this ight away , yeah ?
PLAGUE: Yeah !
SUIT #1: Well , how soon ?
PLAGUE: Well , we 're working on it as fast as we can . This is a very common occurrence in corporations as large as ours . You have nothing to worry about .
SUIT #2: Yeah , right .
SUIT #1: Now , you 're sure about that , Mr . The Plague ?
SUIT #2: Yeah .
SUIT #1: Okay .
PLAGUE: We 'll be in touch . Talk to you later .
MARGO: What the hell was that all about ?
PLAGUE: I had to move fast . The hacker copied my garbage file .
MARGO: What ?
PLAGUE: I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service . So they 'd arrest the hacker , sieze his equipment , things that we ca n't do on our own .
MARGO: I do n't want to go to jail for this .
PLAGUE: Relax . Think about the 25 million dollars .
MARGO: But you 've created a virus that 's going to
PLAGUE: Basically , uhmm , yeah . Mmm hmmm .
MARGO: Jesus . You know , you 're sick , Eugene . You
PLAGUE: Sh , sh sh sh sh .
SECRETARY: Alright , sir .
PLAGUE: I can cancel it any time . I do n't need any program code . But it 's the perfect cover , to confiscate the disc and find out how much of that garbage file has been copied .
MARGO: Get it ! Why did I ever trust you ? Get the file . Otherwise you 'll lose all you toys .
GILL: Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated ?
PLAGUE: No . He 's either very smart or very stupid .
GILL: Then he stashed it somewhere , or he has an accomplice . We 'll release him until his indictment , keep tight surveillance , and see if he leads us to your disc .
AGENT BOB: Listen to this bullshit . `` This is our world now . The world of the electron and the switch , the beauty of the aud . We exist without nationality , skin color , or religious bias . You wage wars , murder , cheat , lie to us and try to make us elieve it 's for our own good , yet we 're the criminals . Yes , I am a criminal . My crime is that of curiosity . I am a hacker and this is my manifesto . '' Huh , right , manifesto ? `` You may stop me , but you ca n't stop us all . ''
AGENT RAY: Now that 's cool .
AGENT BOB: Cool ?
AGENT RAY: Yeah , cool .
AGENT BOB: You think it 's cool ?
AGENT RAY: It 's cool !
AGENT BOB: It 's not cool . It 's commie bullshit !
CEREAL: So what do you think , can I crash at you place tonight ?
DADE: What is it with this guy ?
PHREAK: His parents missed Woodstock and he 's been making up for it since . Hey , you hear about Joey 's bust ?
CEREAL: Yeah . Probably had something to do with that ank in Idaho .
PHREAK: Do you think he could hack a Gibson ?
DADE: Did you talk to him ?
PHREAK: Nope . His mom said he 's grounded for his next three lifetimes .
GILL: What the hell are you doing ? Plague ! He thumps the VR pedestal .
PLAGUE: Gill .
GILL: I think we 've got something .
PLAGUE: Uuugh , hard copy . Plague looks it over and recognizes a name .
AGENT RAY: Secret Service !
AGENT BOB: Do n't move !
DADE: Christ ! What is the
AGENT BOB: Shut up !
DADE: What are you doing , man ? Get off me !
PLAGUE: The year was 1988 . And this nasty virus crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day . Dade has a flashback .
DADE: Fifteen hundred and seven .
AGENT RAY: Wow , huh !
GILL: It got you seven years probation . No computer , could n't even use a touch tone phone .
PLAGUE: Must have been hell , huh ? Zero Cool ? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system . You were our prime suspect , till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it .
PLAGUE: Gill .
DADE: I 'm sorry . Who are you ?
PLAGUE: I 'm the one who understands you . Now , can we e allies ?
DADE: Nah . I do n't play well with others .
PLAGUE: Watch which friends you do play with . A ecord like yours could land you in jail , get you kicked out of school , no colleges would take you . No future . Exiled from everyone and everything you love . Plague replaces the baseball bat .
DADE: Blow me .
PLAGUE: Thank you !
PHREAK: Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help ooks for women . Stuff like `` Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae '' Phreak shows Dade the book .

KATE: What is it with you ? I know we 've been playing games , but , we 're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help . I eally need your help .
DADE: I 'm sorry , I ca n't .
KATE: Well , could you just make a copy of the disc ? And just hide it in case we get busted , so we have something to give our lawyers , something that has n't been tampered with ? Can you do that ? A knock on the door . Dade 's mom peeks in .
MRS. MURPHY: Listen you guys , help yourself to anything in the fridge . Cereal has . She leaves .
KATE: Thank you .
DADE: Okay . I 'll copy it .
KATE: Okay , thank you .
PLAGUE: The girl . The girl has the disc I need .
DADE: I told you , I do n't play well with others .
PLAGUE: Turn on your laptop . Set it to receive a file . Dade does .
DADE: That 's bullshit .
PLAGUE: What can I tell you . Computers never lie , kid . Your mom will be arrested at work , she 'll be handcuffed , and later , strip searched .
DADE: You lay a finger on her and I 'll kill you .
PLAGUE: Kid , do n't threaten me . There are worse things than death and , uh , I can do all of them !
DADE: I got it . But listen , Kate did n't know what 's on it . I mean , she came to me to figure it out . She 's not the one who planted the virus . You leave her alone .
PLAGUE: Hey , do n't worry , kid . If she 's innocent , she 'll be fine . Your mommy 's safe now , okay ?
DADE: Kate , listen .
KATE: Uh , hold on
DADE: I have to tell you something .
CEREAL: Hold on a second !
NIKON: Look at this , it 's so lean and clean .
CEREAL: Looks like a hacker wrote it .
KATE: Come here , look at this . This thing is dense . Nikon points out part of the code .
NIKON: But that 's ill , man . It 's incomplete . This is taking forever and a day to figure out . I 'm gon na make some coffee . Dade takes Nikon 's place .
CEREAL: Tag , you 're in .
DADE: This is n't a virus . It 's a worm !
NIKON: What 's this one eat ?
DADE: It nibbles . You see this ?
KATE: Right . And when the worm 's ready , it zips out with the money and erases its tracks .
DADE: Joey got cut off before he got to that part . Check it out . By this point , it 's already unning at , what , twice the speed as when it started .
KATE: Right , and at this rate it ends its run in
NIKON: Two days .
DADE: And judging by this segment alone , it 's already eaten about
CEREAL: 21.8 million bucks , man . Nikon whistles .
KATE: Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall . And that 's Phreak , and that 's Joey , and that 's us . We 've got to get the rest of the file , so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears , so we can find out WHO created it .
DADE: I know , I know who wrote it .
KATE: What ?
DADE: This Ellingson security creep . I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me .
KATE: You what ?
DADE: I did n't know what was on it .
CEREAL: Oh man . That 's universally stupid , man !
NIKON: Yo , man , you an amateur , man .
KATE: Why did he come to you ?
DADE: I got a record . I was Zero Cool .
NIKON: Zero Cool ? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven systems in one day ?
CEREAL: That 's far out !
NIKON: This is Zero Cool , man ! Whooo , haha !
KATE: Well that 's great . There goes MIT .
DADE: I 'll make it up to you !
KATE: How ?
DADE: I 'll hack the Gibson .
NIKON: They 'll trace you like that man , cops are gon na find you , they 're gon na find you with a smoking gun .
DADE: Fucked if I care , man .
NIKON: Look , even if you had the passwords , it 'll take you ten minutes to get in , and you 've still got ta find the files , man , I mean , the cops will have you in five minutes .
CEREAL: Oh wow , we are fried .
KATE: Never send a boy to do a woman 's job . With me , we can do it in seven .
NIKON: Jesus , I got ta save all your asses . I help , we can do it in five minutes , man .
DADE: Okay . Let 's go shopping .
CEREAL: Woo hoo ! Boom !
GUARD: Alright , hold it right there !
DADE: Shit ! !
KATE: It 's my subway defense system .
NIKON: He 's way down there .
CEREAL: Ta-da !
NIKON: Yo , brain dead , the manual !
WOMAN: Find it ?
CEREAL: Phone 's alright . The problem must be somewhere else .
MARGO: They had a large chunk of the garbage file ? How much do they know ?
PLAGUE: Not everything . But enough to implicate us .
MARGO: You said the worm was untreaceable !
PLAGUE: Yeah . To civilians . But they 're hackers . But do n't worry . All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus , and then they 'll all be put away .
MARGO: Launch the Da Vinci virus ? You ca n't do that !
PLAGUE: No one believes the guilty . Besides , by the time they realize the truth , we 'll be long gone with all of our money . Margo starts to protest .
PLAGUE: The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10 30 ,
GILL: Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby , alias Acid Burn , Emmanuel Goldstein , alias Cereal Killer , Dade Murphy , alias Crash Override , also known as Zero Cool , and Paul Cook , alias Lord Nikon . We pick them up tomorrow morning at nine o'clock .
CEREAL: Snoop onto them
NIKON: as they snoop onto us . Nikon calls Kate .
KATE: Yeah , it 's Kate .
NIKON: Hey , Burn . We got a little problem here .
KATE: Alright , so what have we got ?
DADE: Well , we have fifty passwords , plus whateve Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson .
NIKON: Well , I got a lot , alright ? I do n't know how many but my head hurts .
CEREAL: Yo , everyone check this out . Hey , what 's the Da Vinci virus ?
DADE: What ?
CEREAL: Check this out . It 's a memo about how they 're
KATE: What oil spills ?
NIKON: Whoa , whoa . Yo , brain-dead , today is the thirteenth .
CEREAL: Well this has n't happened yet .
NIKON: Damn !
CEREAL: A worm AND a virus ? The plot thickens . Kate gets ready to get off the subway .
NIKON: Whoa , whoa whoa whoa , where are you going , huh ?
KATE: I got an idea . We 've got a few hours , right , till we get arrested . So just stay low . I 'm gon na go get some help . I 'll beep you , okay ? Are you coming ? Dade gets up .
CEREAL: May the Force be with you , man .

DADE: I do n't like this .
BLADE: What do you want ?
DADE: Ummm we come in peace ? Dade winces at his own corniness .
KATE: We need your help . If you 're up to it .
RAZOR: She 's buff . Ballsy .
BLADE: Let 's keep her .
RAZOR: Waste the dude .
KATE: A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10 30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow .
DADE: It 's somehow connected with the worm that 's stealing the money .
RAZOR: She 's rabid , but cute .
BLADE: See , we 're very busy . A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show .
DADE: Let 's go , Kate .
RAZOR: Wait . Nobody said no . But you are going to need more than just two media icons like us . You need an army .
BLADE: That 's it ! An electronic army ! If I were us , I 'd get on the internet , send out a majo distress signal .
RAZOR: Hackers of the World , Unite !
BLADE: How are you going to take care of the cops ? Dade just smiles .

KATE: Take his place , man , do it . You can do it . Joey takes Cereal 's place .
DADE: Yeah .
KATE: Alright , let 's boot up .
MARGO: What is it ? What 's wrong ?
PLAGUE: Nothing , it 's just a minor glitch .
MARGO: `` Minor glitch '' with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe . The main screen is filled with

MARGO: What 's happening ?
HAL: It 's replicating , eating up memory . What do I do ?
PLAGUE: Run anti-virus . Give me a systems display !
HAL: The rabbit is in the administration system .
PLAGUE: Send a Flu-shot .
MARGO: Rabbit , Flu-shot , someone talk to me .
HAL: A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file , then it spreads like cancer .
MARGO: Cancer ?
KATE: It 's the Gibson , it 's finding us too fast .
DADE: Man , there 's too many garbage files , I need more time .
DADE: Yeah , maybe I 'm not . But we are , you asshole .

GILL: Mrs. Murphy stays right here .
KATE: Oh , wow , she 's great .
DADE: Yeah .
REPORTER: and attacked the Ellingson 's compute network . Is the last we 've seen of this type of high-tech espionage ?

SOMEONE: That kid cut him off !
CEREAL: Hold on , boys and girls . It is I , the Cereal Killer , making my first coast to coast , world wide , global television appearance . Yes , that 's right , I 'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral .

RICK: That 's Mommy .
EMMA: Mommy used to have long hair ? And she wore a bikini ?
WISTFULLY: Yes she did .
EMMA: How come she does n't wear a bikini anymore ?
GUNNAR: Is it because of her fat ass ?
RICK: I guess . What ? No . Who said Mommy 's got a fat ass ?

MAGGIE: I know , it 's just like the old days . Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk .

RICK: The girl walked past and I glanced ack at her for like half a second .
FRED: There 's your problem , dumb-ass it 's the wrong order . You do n't wait for the girl to walk past and then glance back . You turn when she 's still fifteen feet in front of youthen you wait for her to walk into your line of vision .
GETTING IT: It was your air space .
MISSY: Do n't forget to mingle ! The guys watch Missy walk away .
FRED: Wow . Missy 's looking pretty good for someone going through a divorce .
RICK: Yeah , that 's rough stuffI heard they might have to sell the house .

FRED: Yeah , it 's kind of tacky , huh ?
GRACE: Look at those two meatheads checking out Missy Frankenfield . What , do they think they 're invisible over there ?
MAGGIE: I thought you said Fred was n't a gawker .
GRACE: He was standing right next to you . I ca n't let him know that I know that would take all the fun out of it .
CHUCKLES: You should see him . He 's got some stupid move where he looks back efore the girl passes to make it seem like he could n't help but notice her ass . It 's pathetic . Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE .
RICK: How about I drive the babysitte home while you go upstairs and prepare the altar ?
MAGGIE: I want to , honey , but I 've got to get up early with the kids .
RICK: I 'll get up with the kids .
MAGGIE: But I have to go out and buy a gift- -they 're going to a birthday party tomorrow .
RICK: I 'll cjet the gift , then I 'll take the kids to the park , then to the party . You can dust stay in bed , , get your beauty sleep , and bask in the sweet , sweet pounding I 'm about to give you .

PAIGE: Oh , come on , I 'm a junior in college . You drank when you were in college , did n't you ?
RICK: Well , uh
PAIGE: Besides , it 's so arbitrary . How does it make sense that twenty 's old enough to fight in Iraq o watch a porno movie , but it 's too young to drink a beer ? Rick shifts in his seat .
RICK: Really ? Twenty 's old enough to uh ?
PAIGE: Fight in Iraq ?
RICK: No , the other thing .
PAIGE: Watch Porn ? Oh , God yeahhalf the girls in those things are my age .
RICK: I 'm sorry , Paige , I ca n't do that .
PAIGE: Why not ?
RICK: Well it would be.. .inappropriate .
PAIGE: What , is that your grown-up voice ?
SMILES: That would be inappropriate , Paige .
RICK: No , Paige . What are you thinking ? I 'm a married man and I have a family . You think they 'd like it if they knew I was hanging out at the lake , all alone , drinking beer with a college girl ?

RICK: Okay , one quick story . Come on , jump on my back . Emma jumps on Rick 's back .
TO MAGGIE: You can get started without me I 'll be right back . Rick piggybacks Emma out of the room .
RICK: Okay , honey , this is the last pony and then night-night .
EMMA: There . You look pretty , Daddy .

RICK: Nah , the kids were up when we got home . How 'bout you ?
FRED: Well , kinda lucky . Grace conked ight out so I snuck out to the ca and rubbed one out . Rick shoots Fred a look .
RICK: The car ? What are you Knight Rider ? Why did n't you just go in the athroom like a normal guy ?
FRED: And get caught by Grace ? Ca n't risk it . Besides , cars turn me onit 's where I lost my virginity . And they 're comfyI just put the seat ack and turn on the tunes . The guys sit on a bench .
RICK: That 's one of the things they do n't tell you when you 're youngthat you 'll still be jerking-off afte you get married . I thought it was dust gon na be a teenage thing .
FRED: Yeah , I did n't see that one coming .
RICK: What ?
FRED: The arch .
RICK: What arch ?
FRED: You know when you 're taking a girl 's panties off for the first time , and you 're wondering if she 's going to stop you , but then she gives you that little pelvic arch- thrust that tells you that the struggle 's over , everything 's going to be okay ? Rick SIGHS .
RICK: That 's a happy moment .
FRED: Yep . Another thing gone forever . Rick looks at his watch .
RICK: I should get going , I have to drop the kids off at a birthday party .
FRED: You want to grab a coffee after ?
RICK: Do you have any interest in going down to the Patriot 's training camp one of these days ?
FRED: Are you kidding , I 'd love that . ExceptI always feel kind of pathetic waiting in line for Tom Brady 's autograph .
RICK: Fred , I was planning on bringing the kids .
FRED: Genius ! That 's the perfect cover !
RICK: Uh-oh
FRED: Did you see her face ? Her face is tremendous .
RICK: Please do n't have a nice ass , please do n't have a nice ass
FRED: I know . She 's from Australia . Been working here about a month .
RICK: Why 'd you have to bring me here ? !
FRED: Okay , cool it , tigerhere she comes .

FRED: Yeah . I bet her areolas look like a couple of pepperoni slices .
RICK: What the hell are you doing ?
FRED: Shh . I 'm taking a mental photograph for my spank bank .
UNDER BREATH: Say cheese .
RICK: Oh , hey , Ed . Did n't see you there .
ED: That 's because you were shooting laser beams at the java babe .

GARY: That 's the life .
FRED: That is the life .
GARY: How 's it possible to know that my wife wo n't find out ?
ANNOYED: It 's not . I 'm saying if it were possible , like if I was a magic genie and I could grant you this wish but then make it like it neve even happened .
FLATS: But would I still have memory of it ?
GARY: Oof . I think I 'd pay 500 bucks fo that . Baker shoots him a look .

MAGGIE: Sometimes I wonder if it would be etter if they did cheat and get it over with .
DR. LUCY: You mean , rather than take the slow oat to resentment ? The girls look to Dr. Lucy .
BEAT: Have you ever considered giving them a hall pass ?
GRACE: A what ?
DR. LUCY: A hall pass . A week off from marriage . Grace and Maggie stop chewing .
MAGGIE: Wait a minute . . .Are you saying let them go out and cheat ?
DR. LUCY: I 'm saying give them a week off from marriage .
BEAT: Look , most married men have foggy memories of their single days and they somehow get under the impression that if not for you , they 'd be able to be with ail those women who entice them .
GRACE: That 's Fred . He thinks because he sees big tits everywhere and then still comes home for dinner that I should be welcoming him at the doo like some conquering hero . Dr. Lucy smiles .
DR. LUCY: Well , maybe it 's time to let them go out there and find out what it 's eally like .
MAGGIE: Wow . You 're talking about the nuclear option . Maggie ponders the idea .
GRACE: And remind me again , what good could possibly come from this ?
DR. LUCY: There 's a wonderful principle in psychology called 'reactance theory . ' It basically states that if you 're constantly told you ca n't do something , you want to do it more than ever . And conversely , if you remove the taboo , you remove the obsession . Grace makes a 't ' sound .
SARCASTIC: I got an idea , Doc Why do n't you try a hall pass out on your husband and let us know how it works out .
DR. LUCY: Oh , I have . Grace and Maggie REACT to this .
MAGGIE: You 're telling us you let Charlie sleep with another woman ? Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering .
DR. LUCY: I am not telling you that . I am telling you that I gave him the freedom to choose for himself .
GRACE: And ?
DR. LUCY: All I know isour marriage is etter than ever . Grace and Maggie think about this .
GRACE: I do n't know . There 's a reason that men evolved and apes did n't . It 's ecause women demanded more . Without a wife , Einstein would 've een humping a maple tree all day . As the women LAUGH , we
ED: Come on , everyone in the shack ! The grand tour 's about to begin !
MANDY: Un-believable .
ED: That 's sweet of you to say , Mandy .
LARRY: It 's epic , Ed .
KIMMY: Wait a second , Ed , first I want to show them Lny headquarters . Fred looks at Rick and rolls his eyes .
ED: With a price tag north of one hundred and forty large , it bette e paradise .
GRACE: Hey , where did Fred go ? Rick turns and sees that he 's missing .
RICK: What are you doing ?
FRED: I ca n't take these look-at-how-much- I-own parties . It 's obnoxious . Rick nods and sits down beside him .
RICK: Well , kind of . You made me drive around town with you for two hours , emember ?
DEFENSIVE: I thought you 'd want to watch a movie in a mini-van . You never got to watch a movie in a mini-van efore , did you ? Rick shrugs .
RICK: Why 'd you have to hook your boat up to it ?
FRED: Because it 's the Touring Edition , numb-skull . The thing can tow more weight than ninety percent of the pick-ups out there !
KIMMY: The mantle actually came all the way from Tuscany , which is in Europe .
ED: Hey , gang , check this out .
KIMMY: Oh God , Eddie , they do n't need to see thatthey 'll think we 're wackos .
MAGGIE: Oh my God this is like secret agent stuff .
KIMMY: I think having a safe room is a bit over the top , but Ed feels with ou two little ones you can never be too cautious .
GRACE: Aw , you 're such a good daddy .
MAGGIE: Rick ca n't even set up the baby monitors right .
ED: Here come Tweedle-dee and Tweedle- dum .
CALLING OUT: Guys , we 're in here !
KIMMY: They ca n't hear you . The room 's completely soundproof .
ED: And bulletproof .
RICK: They must 've gone downstairs . Fred motions to Ed 's humidor room .
BRITISH ACCENT: Thanks for coming to the war room , old chap . By the way , did I mention that my wife 's vagina never goes above fifty-four degrees , nor below fifty-three .
GRACE: Uh , maybe we should turn this off . But Ed turns THE VOLUME UP .
RICK: Hey , speaking of installations , is that a shiny new set of cans on Mandy Bohac ?
FRED: Either that or she 's wearing he daughter 's t-shirt .
RICK: They look good but I 'll still take the real deal any day .
FRED: Right . You 're telling me you 'd take Kimmy Long 's flapjacks over Mandy 's new speedbags ?
RICK: That 's what I 'm telling you . I like oobs with a little mileage on 'em . They 're more fun .
FRED: Fun ?
RICK: Yeah . You can smoosh 'em , swing 'em , hump 'em , Stretch-Armstrong 'em .
FRED: And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas ?
KIMMY: You people are horrible ! Horrible !
CALLING OUT: I 'm very disappointed , gentlemen !
FRED: Uh , anyone thinking chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone ?
GRACE: Large-mouth vaginas ? ! As the guys cower , we
MAGGIE: You know what really troubles me ? The thing that you 're all so obsessed with is meaningless to you . It 's really just about numbers with you guys . Rick looks up , confused .
RICK: Well , virginity is different fo guys .
MAGGIE: The point is , obviously I like sex , tooit means something to mebut I do n't walk around gawking at every guy I see .
RICK: All right , so I occasionally notice other women . I 'm sorry .
MAGGIE: Occasionally ?
RICK: Okay , you want the truth ? You eally want me to pull back the curtain here ? From the moment I leave the house in the morning 'til the moment I get home , I pretty much notice every woman in my path . Maggie turns to face him .
HURT: So what are you sayingyou 're not happy with our sex life ? Rick reaches up and takes her hand .
RICK: No . Of course I 'm happy , honeyou sex life is greatnot that I would n't mind a little more , but look , one thing has nothing to do with the other . I think about sex a lotall guys dothat 's just the way it is .
MAGGIE: I 'm giving you a hall pass .
RICK: A what ?
MAGGIE: One week off from marriage .
RICK: You mean , like a trial separation ? You are seriously overreacting .
MAGGIE: It 's not a separation , it 's a hall pass . You can do whatever you want . Get it out of your system .
BEAT: Wait a minuteare you for real ?
MAGGIE: It 's not a yes or no offer , and it 's not a debate . You 're getting a hall pass .
RICK: 'Morning .
MAGGIE: There 's a couple hard-boiled eggs in a bowl there for you .
RICK: I 'm gon na have to take them to go , hon , I 've got a showing in fifteen minutes .
MAGGIE: I told you , this is n't negotiable . She turns and faces him .
RICK: You 're really serious about this ?
MAGGIE: Rick , this is n't something that Ilook , I really think you need this . I think we need this . Rick does n't know what to say .
RICK: For how long ?

RICK: Hey , what are you doing here ?

FRED: I do n't get itwhy are n't you more excited ?
RICK: WellI do n't know how I feel .
FRED: About ?
RICK: The hall pass . Something about it is n't right .
FRED: You mean , like , you think Maggie might have a brain tumor o something ?
RICK: No . I mean , just because my wife tells me it 's okay to cheat is it ?
FRED: Uh , yeah .
BEAT: Why ca n't you just accept the fact that your wife is a goddamn saint , Rick ? She 's evolved . Do n't you see ? She gets it !
RICK: Yeah , but there 's a part of me that 's saying , 'Wow , you must have pushed her pretty hard to get he to this point . ' And is that good for a marriage ? That your wife is willing to try something this insane ? Fred ca n't believe his ears .
FRED: Absolutely !
BEAT: Come on , does n't it bother you that our wives dreams all come true , but ours do n't ? Look at Maggie ; when she was a kid she played houseyou g a ve her a house . She played with her E-Z-Bake Ovenyou bought her a Viking . She played mommyyou made her a mommy .
RICK: The oven 's a GE .
FRED: It 's a real gas oven ! And what about you , huh ? Come on , man , you wife is living her dreams.. .and now it 's time for you to live yours . As Rick thinks about this , we
GRACE: Quit lobbyingyou 're not getting a hall pass . And you mark my words , this is going to end up biting Maggie in the ass .
FRED: Why would I need a hall pass ? I 've got you .
GRACE: Not tonight you do n't . I 'm too loated and I have cramps .
FRED: I do n't mind .
GRACE: Fred , do I have to spell it out fo you ? I 'm having my period .
GRACE: Come on , hon , give me a break . Not tonight .
CALLING OUT: Oh , shitI forgot to take the trash out .
OFFICER #1: All right , ma'am , if you say he 's yours.. .you can have him . The Officer TAKES OFF FRED 'S HANDCUFFS .

FRED: Twenty-three minutes ago ! She just left for the Capeshe 's staying with Maggie . It 's just you and me for the next six days !

FRED: And it 's not just meBaker , Gary , and Hog-head are coming out with us tonight !
RICK: No way ? ! They got hall passes , too ? !
FRED: No , no , nothey just want to watch . Rick grows concerned .
RICK: You think that 's a good idea , letting them in on it ? What if they lab and it gets around townit might embarrass our wives .
FRED: Do n't worry , I already talked to them . Their lips are sealed . Rick and Fred smile .
TO BARTENDER: Five MGD 's , my friend .
BAKER: Hey , why are you staying at a hotel if your wives are out of town ?
FRED: Well , we ca n't very well take babes ack to our placesif they know where we live they might end up stalking us .
RICK: Besides , I would n't be able to concentrate with all the pictures everywhere and the kids ' cut-outs all over the fridge .
GARY: Yeah , is n't it weird how your own kids can creep you out sometimes ? Rick shoots Gary a look .
FRED: I get the feeling there 's a lot of divorcees in this place .
GARY: What about those two ? Why do n't you ang them ?
FRED: No way . They 're doing the
GARY: Okay , how about the blonde hostess ? Maybe somebody should nail her , huh ?

MAGGIE: Stop thinking about it , Grace . Why don t you just try to get some sleep ? Grace turns to Maggie .
GRACE: Sleep ? I ca n't sleep . I do n't understand youhow can you Just sit there and read knowing that Rick could be making out with a supermodel right now ? Maggie does n't answer .
MAGGIE: Shh . You 're going to wake the kids .
GRACE: Are you going to sit there and tell me you 're not the least bit concerned about what they 're doing ight now ? Maggie SIGHS .
MAGGIE: Okay I 'm a little concerned .
GRACE: We could 've kept the status quo . I mean , were things really that bad that we had to try something this extreme ?
MAGGIE: For me they were .
BEAT: Look , you may call this a hall pass , but for me it 's more of a Hail Mary pass . I 'm serious , I do n't know what else to do . Grace looks at Maggie , surprised .
GRACE: You 're kidding me ? You 've neve done that ? I do that all the time ! Maggie almost smiles .
MAGGIE: Look , I understand that people have fantasies and that you 're not always thinking about the person you 're with .
GRACE: That 's for sure .
MAGGIE: But it 's justI do n't know it 's een too long since I felt that he was thinking about me .
BAKER: Okay so where to now ? Rick ca n't think in this state .

BAKER: It 's only nine-thirty !
FRED: I 'm with Rico .
YAWNS: Freddy tie-tie .
RICK: Relax , guys , this is just the calm efore the storm . Get out the plywood and batten down the hatches .

RANGER: Not him . Him .

FRED: How long would you have to make-out with him ?
RICK: Tongue ?

RICK: Come off it , Fred . Obviously hooking up is n't something we eally wantif it was , we could 've done it by now .
FRED: Could we have ? Rick is taken aback by this .
WANING CONFIDENCE: Well of course . I mean , if we 'd eally wanted to .
FRED: Guess what ? I did want to . And you know how close I got ? We 're three days in and the only woman I 've spoken to was our waitress at Outback . And she never even made eye-contact .
RICK: I do n't really care if some waitress makes eye-contact . I want to go homeI miss my wife and kids .
FRED: Let me explain something to you If Grace and Maggie find out we ca n't get laid on our own , they 'll start thinking we need them to get laid . Do you know what that 'll do to the alance of power in our homes ? It 'll destroy it ! Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed .
RICK: Well , what if we just tell them that we did hook up ?

RICK: Hey , what about a massage parlor ?

RICK COLEMAN: Nah , but maybe some day . Your mom keeps talking about hooking me up with your cousin Kate . Maggie LAUGHS .

RICK: What 's this ?
FRED: I went on-line this afternoon and wrote down some good pick-up lines to break the ice .
READING: 'Hi . Will you help me find my puppy ? I think he ran into the cheap hotel across the street . '
FRED: That 's a good oneexcept for one thing We do n't have a puppy , so when she gets there she 'll realize we 're full of shit . Rick shoots him a look .
RICK: I do n't think it 's supposed to be for real . It 's just to make he laugh so she 'll talk to you . Fred considers this .
FRED: Oh God no , it does n't work on that level . Here , this is my favorite . He takes the paper from Rick .
READING: 'You must be from Ireland because when I look at you my penis is Dublin . '
RICK: It 's a charmer but you know what ? We do n't need phony pick-up lines . Why do n't we just be ourselves ?
FRED: Great . If you know how to . Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself .
RICK: Give me the helmet .

FRED: Well , I 'm sure she 'd recognize me . Rick thinks about this .

RICK: Bingo . As Fred smiles , we
GERRY: What 's up , beach bunnies ? Grace and Maggie sit up and smile .

MAGGIE: Thanks . I was a dance major in college .
RICK COLEMAN: Really ? I always wonderedwhat do you do with a degree in dance ?
MAGGIE: Well , as it turned out , nothing .
BLUSHING: I guess the original plan was to go to New York and try to hook-up with one of the big dance companies , but then I got married and . . .you priorities change . She looks away , maybe a little embarrassed .
RICK COLEMAN: Why not ?
MAGGIE: I do n't know , you get busy , kids , school , there 's so much going on .

FLATS: Hey , Rick .

RICK: Ohyes .
WEAKLY: Little help
WINDED: No , no , I think I wasin the hot tub too long . I ca n't feel my body .
RICK: What time is it ?
FRED: We let down the male species .
SIGHS: I really thought our hall passes might change the philosophy of marriage in America . Fred eats a big scoop of ice cream .
RICK: All right , do n't give up .
FRED: I 'm not giving up , I 'm facing facts- -this is our last day and we got nothing cooking . Maybe you were ight . Maybe we should just tell the girls to come home .
RICK: No . I want the hall pass . Fred looks at Rick , surprised .
FRED: I 'm not even sure I know what the dream is anymore .
RICK: I justI just want to know what it 's like to be with another woman .
FRED: Well , just pull up one of the golden oldies in your spank bank it 's almost like being there .
RICK: I do n't have anything in that spank ank .
FRED: I 'm talking about all the girls efore you met Maggie . Rick does n't say anything .
BEAT: No , you 're not serious ? Rick lowers his head .
DEFENSIVE: Yeah , so ? What do you think , everyone gets laid in high school ? I got news for you , mistergetting laid in high school is not a right , it 's a privilege . Fred puts down his ice cream . Rick SIGHS .
FRED: Wow . That 's a really creepy story .
BEAT: Yeah .
RICK: Who was that ?
FRED: Just an angel from heaven . Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet .
MAGGIE: Does this mean you 're going steady ?
GUILTY: That 's not funny . I feel terrible the poor kid 's spending all his hard-earned money on methat 's sad . Cute , but sad .
MAGGIE: Grace , you should be flattered . You 're thirty-eight-years-old and college kids are still swooning over you .
GRACE: Well I just feel bad if I gave him the wrong impression .
MAGGIE: The wrong impression ? What makes you think thatI mean , besides the flowers , I.D . bracelet , and love letter ? Maggie picks up a card .
READING: 'Dearest GraceOur final game is tonight . Please meet me at the coach 's place afterwards to celebrate . Yours truly , Gerry . '
GRACE: Thanks for piling on . Grace stands up and SIGHS .
RICK: What are you doing ?
FRED: Just texting Missy Frankenfield that we 're going to be at Enter the DragonI 'm covering all my bases .
RICK: You do n't need Missy Frankenfield tonight . If we ca n't get the jo done with Coakley as our wingman , then we 're pathetic . Just then , Fred NOTICES something O.S .
FRED: All right , here come da man !
COAKLEY: My two favorite nutsuckershow the hell are ya ? !
COAKLEY CONT'D: See who just walke ( in here in front of me ?

COAKLEY: I do n't knowmust be shooting a movie or something .
FRED: Huh . Look , man , we 've got a situation on our hands .
COAKLEY: Yeah , yeah , Baker filled me in . S'been rough sledding , huh ? Coakley puts his arms around the two guys .
FRED: For what ? Coakley shoots him a look .
COAKLEY: If you 're really serious about this , stop questioning me .
SLICK BOUNCER: Good evening , Mr. Coakley .
COAKLEY: What up , my guy ?
RICK: Are n't you the guy who goes to the Hawaiian Tropic finals every year ? Is that for the ugly girls ?
COAKLEY: I go to the Tropic finals because Miss North Dakota 's gon na lose and she 's gon na need a hug . And quite often you can parlay a hug into a hand-job . Rick , you 're upget us two bottles of Moet and six glasses .

RICK: Nice .
PAIGE: So , Rick , how 's the hall pass going ? Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little .
RICK: No , of course notwhat did you just say ?
PAIGE: I was asking about your hall pass . I baby-sit for the Putneys and I heard Gary talking about it the other night at their barbecue . Rick REACTS to this .
RICK: He was talking about it at a arbecue ? !
PAIGE: Oh , he was n't saying it in a bad way .
RICK: Thank you .
PAIGE: So does it work both ways ?
RICK: What ?
PAIGE: The hall pass . Does your wife get one , too .
AMUSED: Uh , no , no . A hall pass is for men only .
PAIGE: Oh . Who made that rule ?
RICK: Well um
PAIGE: By the way , I kind of owe you an apology . ( lowers her voice ,
BASH: Last week ful ) when you drove me home , I should n't have snapped at you like that .
RICK: Oh , do n't worry about it . It was a ig misunderstanding .
PAIGE: No , it was n't . She takes a moment , looks around .
RICK: Yeah . UmI have to go , Paige , but it was great seeing you .
PAIGE: Are you serious ? You 're doing this again even with a hall pass ?
RICK: Paige , you 're my kids ' babysitter . Have a happy birthday . As Rick walks away , we go
COAKLEY: Here we go , bubbles doth floweth .
FRED: Holy crap look who 's here .
LEIGH: Hey , Rick ! What happened yesterday I thought we were gon na grab a eer ? Fred looks at Rick , confused .
SHEEPISH: Yeah , I got a little caught up in my curls and reps and shit .
CHANGING SUBJECT: So is this your playground ?
LEIGH: Nah , I 've never been here , but a friend of mine 's DJ-ing tonight so I promised him I 'd come .
WANNABE: Wassup , girl ?
RICK: Actually , I work for Sirius XM Radiowe 're looking to hire some new deejays so I 'm checking out all the clubs . Wannabe stiffens , suddenly respectful .
WANNABE: Oh . Cool . Are you serious ?
RICK: Not !
ANNOYED: Oh , that 's hip . Real fresh . Why do n't you hit the dance floor the next song 's gon na be for you .
GLARING: Beer ? When were you two going to have a beer ?
GUILTY: No , no , no , Leigh and I just belong to the same gym and happened to be there at the same time yesterday afternoon .
FRED: What gym do you belong to and where the hell was I ?
COAKLEY: Well , according to Kimmy Long , you were at the massage parlor trying to get a rub-and-tug without filling out the paperwork . This takes the wind out of Fred 's sails .
RICK: What ? Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred .
FRED: I had a knot in my neckwhy the hell did n't you tell me you saw Coffee Girl ? !
COAKLEY: Okay , guys , cut the crap . We 're all here for the same thing . And I 'll give you a hint what that thing is It begins with a ' P ' and ends with an 'ussy . ' Coakley puts his arm around Fred .
FRED: Huh ? Coakley spots something .
COAKLEY: Oohthere 's a couple of trainwrecks . Let 's go .
ALARMED: Whoawait a second .
COAKLEY: Ladies , this is my friend Fred Pinkberryhis yogurt company just went public and he 's out celebrating . He 'd like to offer you a flute of champagne . The Chubby Blondes PERK UP .
RICK: So.. .having a good time ?
LEIGH: Chillin ' .
RICK: Me too . Just chillin ' and wigglin ' . LONG BEAT as they dance . Then
TEASING: I can tell .
RICK: Oh yeah ? Just try to keep up .
COAKLEY: Abort ! Abort ! You stand not a chance .
RICK: No , no , I think we 're starting to gel . Coakley rolls his eyes .
COAKLEY: No , no , you 're mistaken . Look , dude , this ai n't Operation Cock- lock herenow trust me , retreat .
RICK: Coak , I 'm never gon na have anothe hall pass , so this memory has to last a lifetime . . .you know what I mean ? Coakley looks at Leigh and SIGHS .
COAKLEY: All right , I 'll be at the bar when this thing blows up in your face . As Rick dances back over to Leigh , we
RICK: Is this guy your boyfriend o something ?
LEIGH: No , no , no . She waves it off , then shrugs guiltily .
RICK: And what does 'messed around a little ' mean these days ?
LEIGH: Anal . Rick tries hard to act nonchalant .
CALLING BACK: Just play your funky music , white oy !
MAGGIE: Oh . Hey . She goes to the screen door .
RICK COLEMAN: Thought you might want to help me celebrate the end of the season . He holds up a grocery bag .
DEADPAN: If they came right now I would , sure .
FRED: Oh my god ! You 're here ! Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug .
CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE: Thanks , Fred , you look good , too .
FRED: Never felt better . Missy nods .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: I have to say , I ca n't believe I 'm actually hereI was on my way home from dinner when I noticed you text . So what 's this big emergency ?
FRED: Huh ? Oh , uh , yeah . By 'emergency ' I just meant that there 's some important stuff I want to talk to you about . You know , one on one , me and youwithout all the husbands and wives and hoopla . So how are you ?
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: I 'm good .
FRED: No , I mean how-are-you . Inside . What 's happenin ' in there ? There must be all sorts of emotions churning up with the divorce and everything . She gives him a long look .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Maybe we should go somewhere else this does n't seem like the best place to spill one 's guts .
UNDER BREATH: What part of 'go ugly early ' did n't you understand ? You 've got a bette chance of winning husband-of-the- year than tagging that chiquita . Fred flinches at this .
FRED: ButI know her . She said she wants to leave with me .
COAKLEY: Then she 's insanerun for the hills .
FRED: Coak , the woman 's going through a divorce . She 's not insane , she 's just making really poor decisions ight now . Here , give Rick the keys to my mini- van . I 'm gon na go back to the hotel with Missy . Coakley looks back at Missy and softens .
COAKLEY: It 's your funeral , princess .
LEIGH: Are you okayyou keep checking your pulse ?
RICK: Nah , I 'm fine . I had a little chest cramp during the last song , but I worked through it . She smiles at this .
LEIGH: Come on , let 's sit this one out . I need a breather .
RICK: Umhave you ever heard of a hall pass ?
GERRY: There she is ! Come on in , I 'm mixing up some margaronis . We lost our final game , but I got fou hits !
GRACE: Oh . Great . Uh , where is everyone ?
GERRY: They all went out to partynow get in here ! But Grace stays on the porch .
GRACE: Gerry , I 'm sorry but I ca n't stay .
GERRY: What ?
GRACE: Yeah , yeah , everything 's fine , ut .I ca n't accept this .
GERRY: Why not ? Grace does a double-take .
GRACE: Gerry , I 'm a married woman .
GERRY: Um I 'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable , Grace . It 's just thatI really like you .
GRACE: I like you , too , Gerry , and you did n't make me uncomfortable .
LEIGH: Soyou 're married ?
RICK: I was n't deliberately hiding it . He holds up his ring hand .
LEIGH: Yeah , I just thought your wife had died or something and you were wearing it out of respect .
UNCOMFORTABLE: Uh , nope . She 's still hangin ' in there . Just then , Coakley PULLS RICK ASIDE .
COAKLEY: Come on , you 're not gon na close the sale herelet 's move this clambake ack to my place .
RICK: Okay , but what am I gon na do there ?
COAKLEY: What do you mean , what are you gon na do ? I 've got a house with edroomsdo the math . When it does n't work out with herwhich it won'tthere 's going to be a bunch of other back-up chicks there . Rick nods then turns to Leigh .
RICK: My buddy 's inviting everybody back to his crib .
LEIGH: Sounds cool . As they walk toward the exit , we
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: I 've got to be honest , Fred I 'm not really sure what we 're doing here .
FRED: What do you mean ? We 're hangin ' , we 're connectingthat 's what friends do . Especially if they want to take it to the next level where they can call each other 'good friends . '
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: You 're married , Fred .
FRED: Ah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: What does blah-blah mean ? You are still married , right ?
FRED: Happily . Look , I do n't want to get into all the details , but my wife gave me this one-time deal where I get to be with another woman .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: I thought we were going to the hotel bar ?
FRED: We are . There 's a mini-bar in my oom . You better hurry up , it 's last call . Fred smiles .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Are you out of your flippin ' mind ? Fred loses the smile .
FRED: Um
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Are you out of your mind ? !
FRED: I 'm going to be honest with you your tone right now is scaring me .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: You call me up for the first time in your life , claim you have some kind of emergency , and it turns out that you just want to screw me ? !
FRED: Or not .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Well , screw you , Fred !
FRED: Nail on the head ! She turns and glares at him .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: What ?
FRED: What you just saidI had that coming . Big time . Fred hangs his head .
SOFTLY: Seriously , Missy , II do n't know what 's gotten into me this week . I think I must be having some kind of mid-life crisis or something ecause I 've been acting like a eal jackass .
SIGHS: Anyway ease forgive me . I eally am very , very sorry and ashamed .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Okay . Whatever .
FRED: Thank you .
MISSY FRANKENFIELD: Fuck you , Fred ! Missy STORMS away .
TO SELF: 'No thank you ' would have sufficed . Fred walks into his room and closes the door .
FRED: Hi . May I help you ?
AUNT MEG: Rick , my name 's Meg . I 'm you abysitter Paige 's aunt , and I just wanted to come over here and tell you this They do n't make men like you anymore . She smiles .
FRED: Oh . Well , thank you .
BEAT: Would you like to come in ?
GERRY: Everything okay ?
GRACE: Yeah . Yeah . It 's just no , everything 's not okay .
GERRY: What ?
GRACE: Look , you 're a great cguy , Gerry , and you 're very charming and very sweet and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt your feelings , utwell , what , just happened can never happen again . Gerry looks confused .
GERRY: Oh .
GRACE: I know it 's probably hard for you to understand butI love my husband .
GERRY: So ? What does that have to do with anything ? Fate threw us togethe and we went with itis n't that what life 's all about ?
GRACE: Not always .
BEAT: It was n't fair to my husband and it was n't fair to you because this could never become anything more than just.. .what it was .
GERRY: I know that .
GRACE: You do ?
BIG SMILE: Of course I do . Jeez . I mean , no offense , but let 's face it , you 're a lot older than me .
GRACE: Right .
GERRY: I do n't mean that in a bad way . I 'm just saying , I did n't think we were going to start dating , you know ? Could you imagine the looks we 'd get ? It 'd be like Hugh Hefner and his girlfriendsexcept in reverse . Gerry CHUCKLES .
GRACE: Yeah , I got that part . Gerry looks at his watch .
GERRY: Ooh , I got ta get going . We have kind of a team meeting in like twenty minutes .
GERRY CONT'D: It 's , uh , kind o a tradition that we always get together on the night of the last game . It would probably e uncool if I missed it .
GRACE: You do n't have to explain .
GERRY: Seriously , though , thanks fo everythingthat was awesome .
LEIGH: I guess I still have a lot to get out of my system before I do the marriage trip . I 'm one of those people who wants to try everything once before I die .
BLURTING OUT: Have you ever been with a married guy ? Leigh pauses , but she does n't flinch .
LEIGH: No .
RICK: Neither have I .
LEIGH: You would ?
RICK: Yes . Leigh gets close .
LEIGH: I do n't want to be a home-wrecker .
RICK: I 've got a one-time pass , remember ?
LEIGH: That was n't just a line ?
RICK: No . It 's for real .
LEIGH: So where can we go to talk some more about this ?
NERVOUS: Um , Coakley has a game room upstairs . We could.. .talk there .
LEIGH: Can you give me a second ?
RICK: Sure .
WANNABE: Well ? Are you coming ? Leigh SIGHS , then approaches Rick .
LEIGH: I 'm sorry , Rick . I have to go deal with this . Rick ca n't believe what 's happening .
RICK: Really ? Now ? I thought you said he was n't your boyfriend .
LEIGH: He 's notbut he is a friend .
MAGGIE: .And he has n't even spent one night in his own bed this week .
RICK COLEMAN: Let me get this straightyou gave him his freedom and now you 're mad that he 's acting free ? This logic clearly stings Maggie .
MAGGIE: I called his assistanthe 's been in the office almost everyday .
RICK COLEMAN: Look , Maggie , for all you know you husband 's been working at a sou kitchen , sleeping in his car al week , and he 's only gotten laid two or three times at most . She looks up and forces a smile .
MAGGIE: Ha-ha . Maggie checks her watch .
RICK COLEMAN: Well , if she went over to break the kid 's heart , the least she could do is lend a sympathetic ear . He flips a pancake onto a plate .
MAGGIE: Oh My-lanta .
RICK COLEMAN: And to wash it all down
RICK: Hey . . .what are you guys doing here ?
BAKER: We did . We 're here with them .
RICK: What are you talking about ?
BAKER: When Leary and Boshane heard about your guy 's hall pass , they convinced their wives to give them one , too .
RICK: You were n't supposed to tell anyone about the hall pass !
LEARY: They did n't say anything . Our wives heard about it at the pool .
RICK: No ! At the pool ? ! Rick rubs his face , distressed .
BOSHANE: Yep . And then about three days ago after some hard-core negotiating we managed to push the bill through .
RICK: Really ? Sohow 's it going ?
BOSHANE: Solid . Very solid .
LEARY: We 're building mucho momentumo . Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION .
ANNOYED: Hey , Baker , a hall pass ai n't just about sex , you know .
BOSHANE: That 's right . It 's about going owling and , uh , staying up late , and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it .
RICK: Have n't gotten laid yet , huh ?
DISPIRITED: It 's a lot tougher than we thought it would be . Just then Gary comes around a corner .
GARY: Hey , dudes , there 's like ten very angable chicks out on the back decklet 's go ! Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER .
LEARY: To freedom !
LEIGH: Hey , where are you going ?
RICK: What are you doing ? I thought you 'd left .
LEIGH: No . I told you , I just had to talk him off the ledge . I calmed him down and sent him on his way .
RICK: Oh . Uh , great .
LEIGH: So where 's that game room ? I thought we were gon na play some games .
RICK: Hey . How come you 're not downstairs partying ? Coakley gives him a sad , worn-out smile .
COAKLEY: All partied out , pal .
RICK: How 's that ?
COAKLEY: Well think about it . There 's two kinds of guys who cheat on thei wives The guy who does it behind her back , and a guy like you who has his wife 's permission .
RICK: Well it 's not really cheating if I have permission .
COAKLEY: Yeah , whatever . The point is , if you asked a hundred people who the etter CJuy is , ninety-nine of 'em would pick you , because you 're eing honestthere 's no deceit involved . Rick is growing uncomfortable .
RICK: Well I did n't really think of it
COAKLEY: It 's like she 's your guilt Sherpa ! Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates .
WEAKLY: Yeah .
COAKLEY: And that , my friend , is why you are a genius . As Rick lets this all sink in , we
FRED: Cheers . They CLINK glasses .
AUNT MEG: Rick , I hope you do n't mind me tracking you downPaige told me where you were staying .
FRED: Please . Not at all .
AUNT MEG: You 've been very sweet to her . Fred waves her off .
FRED: Hey , she 's a good kid . I do what I can for the kids .
AUNT MEG: She told me everything . And I have to say , I was very impressed .
FRED: Hm ?
AUNT MEG: I know she tried to hook-up with youtwice in factand that you set her straight both times .
FRED: Uhhook-up ?
SMILES: Rick , enough with the chivalry . Paige wanted to sleep with you and you did n't take advantage of her . I 'm just saying that 's very cool . He shrugs modestly .
FRED: Well she 's a kid and kids get crushes . I remember in tenth grade I had the biggest crush on my French teacherthank God Mr. LeClaire was professional enough to only date seniors . Meg GIGGLES .
AUNT MEG: I 'm serious , it takes a certain kind of guy to say no to a eautiful young girl like that especially since you have you wi e 's permission now .
FRED: Hey , all you have in this world is your word . As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED , we
RICK: Leigh , I got ta split .
LEIGH: What ?
NERVOUS: Yeah , I kind of hit a wall . She can hardly believe her ears .
LEIGH: Really ? Are you feeling okay ? You 're not mad because I went outside with my friend , are you ?
RICK: No , no , no . Look , I should n't be doing this . I have.. .you know , commitments .
WEAKLY: Um , you dropped something .
LEIGH: Relax . Do n't think so much . You 're gon na have your wife for the rest of your life , but tonight . . .you have me .
RICK: Nope . I ca n't do this . He reaches for his shirt .
LEIGH: What are you doing ?
RICK: I 'm sorry .
LEIGH: Your wife did n't give you a hallway permission slip , did she ?
RICK: Yes , she did , but look , you 're insanely beautiful and pathologically sexy and every cell in my body is telling me to dust do this , but Rick points to his chest .
BEAT: And when my kidsEmma and Gunnar when they were babies , this is where they slept . Or sometimes at four o'clock in the morning Emma would just lay there and stare up at me . It was where we first got to know each other .
LEIGH: Well , I think you have a screw loose and you 're probably going to egret this for the rest of you life , but . . .right on , man .
RICK: Umdo you want me to give you a ide home ?
LEIGH: No . It 's only one-thirtyI 'm going ack down to the party . Rick raises two fingers .
RICK: Peace it .
LEIGH: R-O-C-K in the U-S-A . As they smile at each other one last time , we
RICK: Hello .
ON SPEAKERPHONE: Yes , is this Fred Searing ?
RICK: Oh , uh , no , I 'm sorry , he 's not here right now . I 'm using his car .
ON SPEAKERPHONE: Well , would you know where I could find him ? This is Sgt . Polisner of the Massachusetts State Police . As Rick grows alarmed , we
AUNT MEG: I 'm attracted to men with integrity .
FRED: Thankswow , you got great jugs .
AUNT MEG: Moral-guy 's a tit-man , huh ?
SHRUGGING: Well , I grew up in the midwest .
AUNT MEG: Oh yes ! Rick pleaseI want you to make love to me .
RICK: Fred , I need to talk to you ! Meg GLARES down at Fred , confused .
AUNT MEG: Fred ? I thought you were Rick ? !
RICK: I 'm Rick . Fred cowers guiltily .
FRED: Please do n't judge me . As Aunt Meg KARATE KICKS Fred in the face , we
RICK: All I know is she was in a ca accident and they rushed her to the hospital .
FRED: Oh my God
WANNABE: How do you like me now , Splenda- oy ?
FRED: You moron , that 's Lny car ! His is the one next to it !
RICK: Nice job , Fred .
FRED: Oh come on ! How can a hospital not have a live operator ? !
RICK: It 's four in the morning , Fred . Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel .
FRED: What was I thinking ? ! I had a great wifea beautiful wifeand now I may lose her.. .because of you .
RICK: What are you talking about ? ! You said our wives were living thei dreams , with their fancy gas ovens , and that our dream was the hall pass ! How can you blame this on me ? !
FRED: I 'd never even heard of a hall pass until you flaunted yours in my face ! 'Hey , look at me , I 've got a hall passeveryone should have a hall pass ! ' You ruined my life , Mills !
RICK COLEMAN: This is a great place .
MAGGIE: Yeah , my family 's had it since I was a kid . We used to come for a week a summer , then two weeks , then a month , then by the time I got to high school we were living here all summer long .
RICK COLEMAN: Something 's wrong here , Maggie .
MAGGIE: Hm ?
RICK COLEMAN: Something 's wrong with a guy who would leave a woman like you alone for this long .
UNCOMFORTABLE: Well , you knowI did give him a hall pass .
RICK COLEMAN: So what ? If you were my girl , I would n't have taken it .
MAGGIE: Uh , in Rick 's defense , he did n't eally even want the hall pass . I kind of forced it on him .
RICK COLEMAN: Why would you do that ? Maggie thinks about this .
MAGGIE: I do n't know .
BEAT: I guess I felt like he was n't noticing me anymore . j guess I wanted to feel.. .desired again . And the truth is , in my heart , I neve thought he 'd go through with it .
RICK COLEMAN: What ?
MAGGIE: This hall pass it was n't for him .

TO RICK: Grace was in a car accident !
RICK: I know . She 's okay . Maggie goes back to the phone .
BEAT: Okay so you 're on your way ? Great .
MAGGIE CONT'D: My God , she scared ( me to death .
RICK: March twenty-fifth , 1988 .
MAGGIE: What ?
RICK: The day I lost my virginity . March 25th , 1988 at approximately ten- thirty in the evening . Maggie thinks about this .
MAGGIE: What are you talking about ? We were dating then .
RICK: You were my first . And you were my last . And you were everything in etween . As it all sinks in , Maggie STARTS TO WELL UP .

FRED: I 'm sorry , Grace .
GRACE: For what ?
FRED: For putting you through all this . Grace looks awash in guilt .
GRACE: It 's not your fault , Fred .
FRED: Yes , it isof course it 's my fault . This is n't youdriving around all night , thinkingyou 're not a thinker .
GRACE: Look , Fred , we have to talk about about what happened this week .

GRACE: Yeah . Yeah , we do .
GRACE: Umdeal .
RICK: Come on , you two ! We 're gon na go watch the sun come up !
DANA: Check , check .
AARON: Testing , testing . One , two , three .
DR. SARTAIN: Good afternoon . I 'm Dr. Ranbi Sartain .
DANA: Thank you for taking the time to meet with us . We were hoping to have this chance before he is transferred to the new facility . Glass Hill is far less accommodating .
DR. SARTAIN: Glass Hill is the pit of hell . Underfunded and short staffed . Fo years he has been kept here to be studied . I suppose the state has lost interest in discovering anything further .
AARON: Well That 's why we 're here .
DANA: Do you mind if I record this ?
A SMILE: Why not ?
DANA: How long have you been working with him ?
DR. SARTAIN: I 've examined every case file written on him . I was a scholar of Dr. Loomis before he passed away . Then I lobbied the University of Illinois to be assign to Michael myself .
DANA: Any progress ?
DR. SARTAIN: He has been seen by over 50 clinical psychiatrists . And with each , many different opinions . Loomis reasoned that he was nothing more than pure evil .
DANA: Any you agree with this diagnosis ?
DR. SARTAIN: Evil is not a diagnosis . Under my care , we implemented a holistic form of therapy . Since that time , his tendency for violence has essentially been erased .
AARON: His response to your specific treatment has been effective ?
DR. SARTAIN: We left two kitty cats in his cell overnight and both remained unharmed .
A SMILE: I hate to disappoint you . Aaron stop walking .
AARON: So you 're telling us that there is no similarity between the murderous maniac that made newspape headlines in 1978 and the amenable patient of this institution ? Sartain laughs .
DR. SARTAIN: Michael Myers is an evolving , aging creature like we all are . And although we have worked very closely with him , these halls display the limitations of my analysis . Loomis saw Michael as a east in the wild . He witnessed human behavior at its most primal , while the rest of us only have the opportunity of observation in captivity .
AARON: I 'd love to stand near him and get a sense of his awareness Or lack of awareness .
DR. SARTAIN: Make no mistake . He is aware . He was watching you as you arrived . When he 's not out here in the courtyard , he walks from this window to that window , to the other . Observing things . Aaron and Dana look curiously to each other .
TO AARON: And perhaps you 'd like to tie you left shoelace . Mr Tovoli , the gentleman with the umbrella , has a fixation for such things . Underestimate no one .
AARON: Michael . My name be Aaron . I 've followed your case for years , and I still know very little about you . I want to know more about that night . About those involved . The Shape is motionless .
RAY: You see this ? I switched from marshmallow fluff to peanut butter . We 'll see if the little devil snatches it .
SHANAH: I rescheduled my last session , so I 'll be able to make it tonight .
ALLYSON: You did n't have to do that . It 's not that big of a deal .
RAY: Of course it is . You got into National Honor Society . It 's a very ig deal .
BEAT: I was top of my shop class , made ashtrays and birdhouses . Ray loads up another mouse trap .
SHANAH: And I 'm looking forward to meeting Cameron .
RAY: I know his father Lonnie and his uncle James . The entire Elam family has a reputation .
SHANAH: Ray , c'mon .
RAY: What ? ! You know about his situation , right ? It 's a relevant factor . The whole household is
LAUGHING: That 's not fair , dad . Cameron is n't like that . He 's a nice guy Ray walks to the sink to wash his finger .
RAY: I 'm not saying he 's not nice . It 's just- You 're too smart to go out with troublemakers and dip shits .
ALLYSON: You 're right .
BEAT: Did you guys invite Grandmothe like you said you would ? Shanah looks to Ray . They make eyes .
SHANAH: I did . Talked to her yesterday . She 's not going to be able to make it .
ALLYSON: Really ?
SHANAH: She 's agoraphobic . In serious need of cognitive Um behavioral- A buzzer RINGS .
ALLYSON: Vicky 's here . I got ta go .
VICKY: How do you know ?
ALLYSON: She never even called her .
DAVE: That 's bullshit .
VICKY: What 's your mom 's deal ? Why would she say that ?
ALLYSON: She just tries to keep me away from her . Says she turns into a nutcase this time of year .
VICKY: Your grandmother is Laurie Strode . If I were her I would n't celebrate either . I 'd put up a Christmas tree instead . Just skip over all the spooky Halloween shit , right ?
STONED RAMBLING: Jumping to Thanksgiving would make sense . Puritans , cornucopias , plagues , starvations , slaughtering the Indians . That stuff is n't creepy at all .
VICKY: Does she ever talk around it ?
ALLYSON: Pretty much all she talks about . It defines her life . She 's been in shock ever since . You should see her house .
VICKY: Freaky .
DAVE: Was n't it her brother that killed those baby-sitters ?
ALLYSON: No . I think people made up the bit about them being related because it made them feel better . Like it could n't happen to anyone .
VICKY: To have a bunch of your friends get slaughtered by some random crazy person how awful .
DAVE: Is it though ? I just feel like the universe has way worse shit now . One dude just kills a few people , I do n't know .
VICKY: Her grandmother is a bad ass and was almost fucking murdered , Dave !
DAVE: And she escaped ! And he was caught ! He 's like super incarcerated right now . It 's not like the worst thing that has happened to a person . By today 's standards . Vikcy stops and turns .
VICKY: Shut up , Dave . Stop talking .
DAVE: I 'm sorry . I sensed myself going on a rant and did n't know how to eject . Sorry .
VICKY: Yes , please . Allyson takes the top off .
ALLYSON: Go for it .
DAVE: Wooooo ! happy Halloween ! It EXPLODES as they run away .
DANA: What is it we 're after ?
AARON: To see the animal inside its environment . I fear there has been no rehabilitation . In this case it seems one monster created another . A victim locks herself away . Imprisoned by her own fear . Ou goal is to get them in a room together . Can we find a form of ehabilitation if she faces him again ?
DANA: Here we are .
AARON: Journalists do n't pay fo interviews , Dana . This is he fifteen minutes of fame . There are two people in this world that care about her and they 're both in this car .
DANA: She 's financially unstable . Had every job you can think of for the last forty years from catering to cosmetology . Currently unemployed .
AARON: Yes . We 're looking for Laurie Strode .
LEANING OVER: We 're investigative journalists .
AARON: If you have a moment . We 've travelled a long way to speak with you . No response .
DANA: How does three thousand dollars sound ?
LAURIE: Sounds about right .
LOOKS AROUND: Do you feel isolated ?
LAURIE: I do n't .
AARON: You tell yourself that you 're protecting your family . That if he come for you again you 've distanced yourself from everyone that you love .
DANA: Aaron and I have made several award winning public radio exposes . Ou last project shed fresh light on a murder case from twenty years ago . We like to re-examine incidents with an unbiased lens . When people are willing to face a thing in a different light over time , new truths can sometimes emerge . I elieve there is a lot to learn from the horror you experienced .
LAURIE: There 's nothing to re-examine . Nothing to learn from something that happened forty years ago .
AARON: So is he real ?
LAURIE: Who ?
AARON: The Boogeyman . I 've read you
LAURIE: You do n't believe in The Boogeyman ?
AARON: I believe in Michael Myers , a deranged serial killer . But The Boogeyman ?
LAURIE: Well , you should .
AARON: We have archival recordings of Dr. Loomis from after that horrific night .
LAURIE: He just wanted Michael dead and no one would listen .
DANA: Michael Myers is a human being that killed his sister when he was six years old . And then he came afte you We want to know why . We want a glimpse inside his mind . That 's why your story be important .
LAURIE: My story ?
AARON: Two failed marriages . A rocky family relationship with you daughter and grandaughter . Among other issues
DANA: Aaron !
LAURIE: It 's interesting that Michael killed five people and he 's a human eing . I 'm twice divorced and I 'm a asket case .
HESITANTLY: My apologies . Laurie gets up and scavenges aimlessly .
LAURIE: I have nothing but vague , very lemished memories of that night . The insight you 're here for does not exist . Aaron nods .
AARON: They 're transferring him .
LAURIE: I know . Tomorrow .
DANA: He 'll be locked away till the end of his days .
LAURIE: That 's the idea .
AARON: Do you surrender any efforts of ehabilitation ?
LAURIE: -Because everyone knows 40 years is when you typically turn the corner . Dana switches gears .
DANA: Let 's talk about when the state came to take your daughter away . She was twelve years old . They said you were unfit mother . How long until you regained custody ?
LAURIE: I did n't . But I bet you know that .
AARON: Mrs Strode . We want you to sit down with him . Sit with Michael in a safe environment . He wo n't talk to anybody But he might speak to you . Finally you can get the chance to say what you 've always wanted to say to him . Come with us . Let us help you free yourself .
LAURIE: Time 's up . I 'll accept my payment .
DISGUISED VOICE: Gottcha ! Allyson drops her books .
ALLYSON: Cameron . Jesus . Cameron helps her pick up her books .
CAMERON: I got you , babe . Do you have everything for your costume tomorrow night ? Bonnie and Clyde must roll as one .
ALLYSON: I 'm just thinking about tonight .
CAMERON: Tonight ? Come on . I thought you were joking when you said you parents were old fashioned .
ALLYSON: Be nice . It 'll be nice . I just want you to meet them . I 'm more old fashioned than they are . Just do n't make them like you too much . I like to keep them on edge .
CAMERON: Dude , you got your chapped lip crusties all over me , man .
OSCAR: You have everything for you costume tomorrow night ? Tango and Cash must roll as one . Oscar puts on Chap Stick .
CAMERON: Um
OSCAR: What ? You said we were going as Sly and Kurt , bro . You said we were doing this Halloween dance thing . What 's up ? You 're ditching me now ?
ALLYSON: I 'll see you lovebirds later .
TO CAMERON: And I well see you tonight .
CHILD #1: I 'm Bradley and I get angry at the ain .
CHILD #2: When my brother comes home from school I get scared cuz he brings the guys to fight and throw people through walls .
CHILD #3: If you run away from home then you have no one to hurt you .
SHANAH: We need to look at those who love us for protection and comfort but listen to our feelings . We all have lived through difficult situations and are confronted with ad people from time to time , but y using our voice we can overcome our problems .
LAURIE: Allyson reached out to me-
SHANAH: I specifically told you you 're not to have any communication with her .
LAURIE: I ca n't control who calls me . She 's her own person and she 's making her own decisions .
SHANAH: What did she reach out to you about ?
LAURIE: Joining you tonight .
SHANAH: Interesting . I guess she has n't picked up on the fact that you aised me .
LAURIE: I raised you the way I did for you own protection and you 're telling me I ruined your life ?
BEAT: As a mental health care professional , I would hope you could empathize in some way .
LAURIE: Michael Myers is leaving Smith Grove . I 've spent years petitioning for his transfer . He 'll spend the est of his life at a prison in Colorado . I 'm going to do what I can to put my past behind me . It 's een forty years . I just wanted to come here today and tell you that . She takes a moment in attempt to connect .
SHANAH: I 'm happy that you 're ready to put your past behind you , but I 've got to figure out if I can put our past ehind me . Laurie turns to leave . Shanah switch gears .
RECORDING: Dr. Samuel Loomis , January 1979 . Do you wish to give a statement regarding your forme patient Michael Myers ?
RECORDING: My suggestion is termination .
KUNEMAN: A-2201 . Myers , Michael .
RECORDING: A shot of sodium thiopental would ender him unconscious .
HASKELL: Stand up ! Hands up ! Shut up !
RECORDING: Then a shot of potassium chloride to stop his heart . He would go quietly , without incident .
HASKELL: Hands on the wall ! Kuneman reads more names from a check-list
KUNEMAN: A-2209 Aaron White A-2217 Anthony Murphy . A-2243-Jeffrey Neundorf . A LOUD BUZZER sounds .
RECORDING: I 'll be with him to make sure his life is ended . My ear on his chest to hear for myself that his vitals no longer function . At that point with the help of a coroner we will extract the brain for our studies and then incinerate the body .
DR. SARTAIN: Do n't worry , Michael . I 'll be by your side .
RECORDING: It needs to die . It wants to die !
HASKELL: A-7367 secure . All clear .
KUNEMAN: Still not sure why you 're here .
DR. SARTAIN: Michael Myers is my patient until he is in somebody else 's care . I 'm seeing my duty through till the end .
KUNEMAN: Buckle up , Dr. Sartain .
RECORDING: There 's nothing to be won from keeping evil alive and gestating .
RECORDING: Destruction is the only solution for Michael . A quiet death before it kills again
LAURIE: Put the Boogeyman to bed now , will you Kiddo ?
ALLYSON: You said she was going to come .
SHANAH: She said she would . She came to my office . We had a nice talk .
ALLYSON: Did you really have a talk ?
SHANAH: I 'm being honest with you . We all have to be truthful from now on no matter how much it might hurt us .
RAY: Allyson 's grandmother has had some struggles , Cameron .
CAMERON: We have a lot of addiction in family too . A lot of troubled individuals .
SHANAH: Ca n't we have a nice dinner now ?
RAY: Cameron , do you know I went to school with your father ? He used to sell me Peyote .
ALLYSON: Dad !
RAY: It 's true . I learned a lot about myself .
CAMERON: He , um He 's weird .
SHANAH: Come on Ray , that 's like a massive over-share for our new friend . Do you have any special All Hallow 's Eve plans ? Allyson looks to Cameron .
ALLYSON: Hey ! I did n't think you were coming . Laurie looks to Allyson and winks .
LAURIE: Wrapped up later than expected . Laurie looks to Cameron .
CAMERON: Cameron Elam . Nice to meet you .
LAURIE: He 's got a firm handshake . Not wet and clammy like Ray 's .
RAY: Wonderful to see you , Laurie . We 're casually getting to know Cameron here and we 're having a nice little celebration in honor of Ally-
LAURIE: We 've all got something to celebrate tonight , do n't we ? How was the ceremony ?
SHANAH: It was very nice . Want to have a seat , Mom ?
DISCREET: What are you on ?
ALLYSON: Mom !
LAURIE: I 'm used to it . I 'm a bad mom when I do n't show up and a bad mom when I do .
SHANAH: Stop it . Reset . Let 's start over .
LAURIE: Yes . I agree . Where 's the waiter so I can get a drink ? I mean if I look the part Right ?
LOUDLY: Hello ? Waiter ? Drinks ? Does ANYBODY work here ? !
SHANAH: Stop it . We were just about to get the check actually .
ALLYSON: No we were n't .
LAURIE: I 'm sure Cameron could use a stiff one . She looks at him . He looks nervous .
SHANAH: Mom !
RAY: That 's enough !
LAURIE: Jesus , I 'm just kidding . Anyway , where is this waiter ? ?
FATHER: I ca n't reception on this thing ever since the antenna was bent at the car wash .
SON: Imagine if they had won last week . They got hit with the 18th-ranked offense , but they totally got wrong all protection . They had season- worst marks of negative-eight ushing yards , 295 total yards and five turnovers . Randall scored twenty-eight points off those takeaways , including 21 in the decisive second half . Father turns off the radio in frustration .
FATHER: Dammit ! Ca n't we just listen to the silence ?
SON: Dad , look out !
FATHER: What the hell happened to you , Hoss ?
SON: Oh shit , dad . Look .
FATHER: Stay here Lumpy . I 'll check it out .
KUNEMAN: Help .
SON: The police are on their way . What happened ? Where 's my dad ? Kuneman gnarls something and spits blood .
KUNEMAN: No . Run
SON: Dad ? Daddy ? !
DR. SARTAIN: Do n't shoot .
SON: Aw ffff- !
SHANAH: You need to know this . I was raised to trust no one . Our house was a unker and I lived on lockdown my entire childhood . We 'd hide in the asement every time the paranoia set in . I still have nightmares about that room . She did n't let me go to school . Instead she trained me to shoot and fight until social services came and took me away . I chose to forget the neurosis she planted in my head .
RAY: She told me to give you this .
ALLYSON: What is it ?
SHANAH: It 's like she 's spent her entire adult life preparing for the past . She lives every day in fear he 's coming back .
SHAMEEL: Yo Hawkins , you want that strawberry slushy or blue raspberry slushy ?
OFFICER HAWKINS: I 'm in wizard mode , Shameel . Get me a coffee if you do n't mind . Thanks . I 'll get you back .
COREY: Another loss for hot fuzz !
STANFORD: If the ball comes down loose , do n't hit that bounce pass . It 's gon na hit off that broken flipper then whack the bottom of the slingshot and go down the middle . A new ball emerges as Hawkins ' radio squawks .
COREY: Hot fuzz personified , born to lose .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Sheriff 's Department ! If you need assistance , please let yourself be known !
WEAK: I ca n't .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Sir . Help is coming . Stay with me !
DR. SARTAIN: Did he Did he escape ?
OFFICER HAWKINS: Who ? Did who escape ?
AARON: Room for one more ? Dana laughs .
DANA: Take that hideous thing off .
AARON: When I wear this , there is a certain tendency or inclination that the legacy of the mask seems to inspire .
DANA: Please do n't murder me .
WITH CHEESE: I would never . I need your smile .
ONLOOKER #1: Who in the hell would do this ?
ONLOOKER #2: It 's awful .
ON TV: Police have not determined the cause of the accident , but we do know there are multiple fatalities . Laurie turns to look at the TV .
CARETAKER: My cousin works at a graveyard not too far from here . They got Wa Generals , Philanthropists , a eatnik poet . They got Muddy Waters and Bernie Mac . People come from all over to pay respects . But this gal from Haddonfield . This is ou only claim to fame .
DANA: As she sat combing her hair . Unaware . Her six year old brothe crept in quietly with a kitchen knife . A look of disgust on the caretaker 's face .
CARETAKER: Damn . Aaron joins in . She hands him the recorder .
AARON: He then proceeded to slice the base of her skull down to her spinal chord , here then she turned and raised he hands in self-defense . He continued stabbing into the arteries and nerves of her palms , like so Once she collapsed , three more stabs in her sternum , piercing he heart .
CARETAKER: I do n't know about sternums . All I know is we 've had to replace this stone two times , people come around and put demon pentagrams and voodoo shit on it . Every Halloween . Crazy coconuts .
DANA: If we could get those initial police transcripts from the press conference and post-conviction proceedings we might have a great prologue for our story . Dana gets out of the car and goes to Aaron .
AARON: We have access to Brackett 's personal journal on Michael as well as city records .
DANA: What are you waiting for ?
CASHIER: Back out around the side .
AARON: Dana ? !
DANA: Excuse me . Someone 's in here .
AARON: Oh bollocks .
DANA: NO ! ! !
WHISPERS: What have we done .
DANA: Aaron ! ! !
SHERIFF BARKER: Still waiting to ID the patients we found to see who 's who . Almost all accounted for . Found two of them trying to check their e-mail at the local library and three others holding hands and chasing utterflies by the flea market off 220 . Any word from Rip van Winkle over there ? The Sheriff sip his coffee .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Not yet . The nurses say he 's been in and out . Lost a lot of blood . Somehow managed to fall on a ullet . I 'm trying to get the story . Because here 's my concern Take a look at this list . Hawkins hands him the list . Sheriff scans it .
SHERIFF BARKER: Look Frank , I do n't need to incite panic until we have all the facts . Myers loose with a bunch of nutbags in Haddonfield on Halloween night is a fucking joke if it 's not legit . It sounds like a joke . It would ruin our department . And if it is legit . If Myers did escape , we 're gon na have a serious circus on our hands . Hawkins looks at the Sheriff .
HAWKINS: There 's a reason we 're supposed to e afraid of this night . Hawkins ' radio squawks .
THROUGH RADIO: Dispatch to 601 . Dispatch to 601 .
VICKY: So , bad news . I ca n't go to the dance tonight .
ALLYSON: Serious ?
VICKY: I got a call to baby-sit . They needed somebody at the last minute .
ALLYSON: I get it . You did n't let up about me going and then you back out ?
VICKY: It 's good for you to go . You 're going out with Cameron now . You 'll hang with his friends . It 's his scene . You ca n't just use homework as an excuse , can you ? Can you ? !
ALLYSON: Maybe I like doing- I 'm not being anti-social . I 'm just reserved .
DAVE: You 're sheepish , only like in a very fresh way . They get to Vicky 's car .
VICKY: Look , I would n't bail on you , but I need some cash , so I said I would . You 'll have fun . I promise .
DAVE: Vicky 's also gon na have some fun . She said if I behave , I can come over after the kid 's nighty night and do cool stuff . Like clean dishes , mop up , keep her company .
VICKY: You 're like my helpful pet . I appreciate you , Dave . If you help me mop and do dishes I 'll take you virginity . Enough of this third ase shit , right ? We 're adults . She takes her back pack from him .
DAVE: Finally . Hey , wan na get matching tattoos so we can remember this day forever ?
ALLYSON: Hey , there 's Cameron . I 'm gon na catch up with him . You guys go on without me .
VICKY: Okay , if not you 're pissed at me . Are you pissed ?
ALLYSON: No . I just thought It 'd be more fun if you 'd hang with me . That 's all . Cameron is sweet , but I 'm still getting used to the idea I do n't know . And his friend ?
OSCAR: There she is , brother . What do you say ? She 's a knock out . I would definitely take her over me any day of the week . I 'm not offended .
CAMERON: I like her . I 'm serious . And I do n't want you to fuck this up by doing something stupid . Please .
OSCAR: Hey Allyson . Guess what ? Cameron likes you more than me , but I 'm over it . I 'll see you guys later . I 'm gon na catch up with Bianca and see if any of those ladies need a handsome male escort to Halloween .
CAMERON: He 's a mess . You okay ?
ALLYSON: I 'm fine . I could n't sleep . I was so embarrassed about last night . I 'm sorry you had to see that . It 's a weird time for me I guess .
CAMERON: Wait till you meet my family . You grandma has nothing on my Uncle James . Do n't worry about that stuff , okay ?
ALLYSON: Okay . I wo n't worry .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Is that who I think it is ? The cop sees Laurie .
OFFICER RICHARDS: Yeah . She calls the station at least twice a month . She 's a paranoid pain in the ass .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Tell her to go home .
DETECTIVE: State issued .
SHERIFF BARKER: Get on the phone to Smith 's Grove and confirm the match .
OFFICER HAWKINS: In the meantime , we have to let people know , Sir .
SHERIFF BARKER: Not until we have confirmation . I do n't want the media foaming at the mouth and dragging the name of this town through the headlines again .
OFFICER HAWKINS: I strongly disagree , sir . If this is who we think it is , we have one order of business . Hunt this man down .
SHANAH: Ray ?
RAY: Shanah ?
LAURIE: Bang . You 're dead . Shanah gasps .
SHANAH: You scared the shit out of me . What are you doing in my house ? !
LAURIE: Side window is unlocked . No security system . You have a dozen knives available for any psychotic to come in here and stab you with . Sometimes I ca n't tell the difference between ignorance and stupidity .
RAY: I know Jujitsu , Laurie . I can apply pressure points and choke holds to use the opponents force of attack against them .
LAURIE: Michael has escaped . I 'd be a fool to think this is over . If he comes for my family , I 'll be ready .
SHANAH: Mom , no one 's coming after you and they 're not coming after us . Get out of my way .
RAY: Maybe you should put down that gun ? Laurie steps out onto the front porch .
THINKING: 'Out of my way ' . It 's like I 'm always in your way , are n't I , Shanah ? You 're always going somewhere and you 're trying to leave me behind . Evil is real . You do n't know what it 's like to feel true terror . To live powerless . I do n't ever want you to feel that way . I only want to train and protect you .
SHANAH: The world is not a dark place . It can be full of love and understanding and I do n't need you psychotic rants to confuse me o convince me otherwise .
RAY: You need to leave , Laurie .
LAURIE: Do you have a gun ? Shanah step to the door .
SHANAH: Of course not . She shuts the door in her mom 's face .
COWBOY KID: Hey wait up !
HUSBAND: Oh hell , I ca n't find my keys .
WIFE: We 're going to be late .
HUSBAND: Let 's go , baby .

CAMERON: I just need a kiss from you .
ALLYSON: Looks like you just got one from Kim ?
CAMERON: That was nothing .
ALLYSON: Really ?
CAMERON: Yeah . Every time I turn around , you 're in your phone . Looking at it , texting with people , talking with people . It sucks . And I did n't do anything with Kim . She came up to me . Gave ME a kiss . Do n't cry about it .
ALLYSON: You 're drunk . Oscar got you fucked up .
CAMERON: Come 'ere . Come on . He grabs her arm and pulls her toward him .
ALLYSON: Do n't .
CAMERON: See ! This piece of shit .
ALLYSON: What the fuck ? !
OVER RADIO: Base to all units . Intrusion in progress at 707 Meridian Avenue .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Haddonfield Sheriff 's department . Responding to a domestic disturbance ! He holds his gun with arms outstretched .
LAURIE: Fuck ! Jesus ! What the fuck ? ! Hawkins sits up and rubs his bruised jaw .
OFFICER HAWKINS: You were told to go home .
LAURIE: I shot him ! I almost shot you too .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Did you see which way he went ?
LAURIE: No . But do me do me favor . If you find him before I do , finish him .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Sure . Sure . You get a license fo that fire arm , lady ?
LAURIE: I do . And this one too . Laurie pulls a Glock 34 out of her pocket . Hawkins raises an eyebrow .
SHERIFF BARKER: Hawkins , look who 's up !
DR. SARTAIN: Where is he ?
OFFICER HAWKINS: You tell me .
DR. SARTAIN: The bus lost control after Michael overtook the first guard , then the driver . He is no longer dormant . I saw him kill with my own eyes . He only knows how to keep moving and to keep killing and he will kill again unless he is captured .
SHERIFF BARKER: What I want to know is why he did n't kill you ?
DR. SARTAIN: I tried to hide , but he found me . Locked me to a seat . He looked down at me . I closed my eyes and when I opened them , he walked away . Barker looks to Hawkins .
SHERIFF BARKER: Hawkins , come talk to me for a second . Doctor , please wait here .
OFFICER HAWKINS: He 's not an asset , he 's a liability .
SHERIFF BARKER: You 're going to take him . He knows Myers better than anyone .
OFFICER HAWKINS: You want me to take this injured civilian to search for a psychopathic serial killer ?
SHERIFF BARKER: You were right . I was wrong . We 're clearing the streets . Patrol cars on every corner . I 'm going statewide with this . Let 's find this son of a bitch . You hear me ?
OFFICER HAWKINS: We do n't need your help right now , Ms. Strode .
DR. SARTAIN: Excuse me , officers .
SHERIFF BARKER: Laurie Strode , meet Dr. Sartain .
DR. SARTAIN: I 'm Michael 's doctor . Ranbi Sartain .
LAURIE: You 're the new Loomis . I can tell y the classy accent .
DR. SARTAIN: I 've read everything about you in his case files . Do you know ou friend Mr. Hawkins here was the esponding deputy when Michael was apprehended in 1978 ? Barker glances curiously at Sartain .
LAURIE: Loomis calling for his execution did n't persuade you ?
OFFICER HAWKINS: I used to believe that due process alanced the power of the law of the land . I 'm not so sure anymore .
LAURIE: I prayed everyday that he would escape .
OFFICER HAWKINS: What the hell did you do that for ?
LAURIE: So I could kill him .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Well , that was a dumb thing to pray for As he gets into his car
DR. SARTAIN: Will you come with us ?
LAURIE: No . I need to protect my family .
SHERIFF BARKER: We have you covered , ma'am .
CAMERON: Just put it in a bag of rice . It 'll e fine .
ALLYSON: I leave you alone for literally two minutes and you run to talk to the one girl that stresses me out . Then you break my phone ? !
CAMERON: Listen . I had too much gin . I told you . Kim was talking to me . She came on to me . I 'm trying to be espectful that she still has feelings . I 'm sorry . She already has eating issues and I do n't want to make it worse . What was I supposed to do ? She looks at her phone .
ALLYSON: It 's ruined . It 's totally sticky with fucking Velveeta on it .
CAMERON: Good ! Now we actually have to bla to each other . Seriously . Let 's have some fun . Please . If we do n't this is a completely degrading experience . I 'm serious .
OFFICER #1: You guys got ta clear out of here . Party 's over ! Got ta clear out !
OFFICER #2: Curfew has been put into place . It 's not safe ! You guys need a ride home ?
ALLYSON: What 's happening ? Why are n't we safe ? Why do we need to go ?
OFFICER #1: Because I fuckin ' said so . It 's not safe to be on the streets . We need you to get home . Now .
ALLYSON: We were just leaving- Cameron interrupts .
CAMERON: No we were n't . Dude . We 're in the middle of a fight and we were at the point of a breakthrough when you shined that goddamn flashlight in my face ! Why you got ta be dicks-
ALLYSON: Cameron ! The cops look at each other and then engage .
OFFICER #1: You okay ma'am ?
OFFICER #2: Who 's your smart ass friend ? Come here !
RECOGNIZES HIM: Cameron Elam ? Of course . Elams always running their mouths .
CAMERON: Oh yeah ?
OFFICER #2: That 's a pretty dress you got on . Your mom dress you up like that ?
CAMERON: Go fuck yourself .
OFFICER #2: What did you say ?
CAMERON: You say anything about my family again and I'll-
OFFICER #2: I know exactly what you 'll do . Assault a police officer . You 'll sit on the roof of your garage and throw rotten eggs at me like you did last time .
CAMERON: I was ten years old and made you look like a bitch in front of you entire department .
OSCAR: Cameron ? What 's up dude ? Are you eing misunderstood again . This is a heartbreaking case of mistaken identity Your Honor .
IGNORING OSCAR: Take him in . He 's drunk off his ass on school grounds . We do n't have time for this shit . Allyson ca n't believe it .
CAMERON: Are you serious ? Are you fucking serious ? ! ! Allyson !
OFFICER #2: Who 's the little bitch now ?
CAMERON: Oscar ! Get her home safe , man .
OFFICER #1: Party 's over !
CAMERON: Get her home !
SHANAH: Mom ! Do we have to do this-
LAURIE: I never wanted you to be scared , aby . Never . Just prepared . Laurie takes her hand .
OSCAR: This is an amazing night , right ? ! Do n't you just love Cameron ?
ALLYSON: No . I think he 's a jerk .
OSCAR: He 's cool . So bad ass . But I can tell you 're pissed about you phone . He plopped it into the chili con queso .
BEAMING: Classic Cameron !
ALLYSON: I 'm tired of people letting me down . You give them the benefit of the doubt and think they 're going to be different , but then they show you who they truly are . Cameron does n't want people to judge him , ut then he acts like a jerk . Gets drunk , gets arrested . Oscar stops . She turns .
OSCAR: You deserve better . You 're the smartest , most beautiful girl at school . Anyone that does n't appreciate that is crazy .
ALLYSON: Thanks Oscar , that 's sweet .
OSCAR: Check it out . 5.0 . Let 's detou this rendezvous .
OFFICER HAWKINS: From a clinical perspective , would you say that Laurie Strode has lost her fucking marbles ?
DR. SARTAIN: There are many ways for tragedy to change a victim . They can grow accustomed to always being afraid . They can become weak or they can ecome strong . But there is also the other side .
OFFICER HAWKINS: What side is that ?
DR. SARTAIN: The core of the victimizer . This is what has intrigued me through my studies . How does a crime like Michael 's change him ? What is he feeling ? Is he on a random path o is he emotionally driven ? Triggered y something . Some unheard marching order imprinted on his very being ? Evil incarnate . Michael and I had a special connection , but without his verbal participation there was a side of his mad journey that I could never understand .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Walk a mile in another man 's shoes , or something like that , right ? Not for me , brother .
DR. SARTAIN: Tell me what become of his childhood home .
OFFICER HAWKINS: That old place was a shrine kinda- thing but for serial kille groupies and death metal bands . Vandals got the best of it . A local organization that I work with tore it down and turned it into a community garden . Turned tragedy into beauty if you can consider it .
OSCAR: Watch out for the poison ivy . It 's all over .
ALLYSON: This is a dumb short cut .
OSCAR: Treacherous . Let me give you a hand .
ALLYSON: Thanks . He does n't let go . He grins at her .
OSCAR: You deserve better .
ALLYSON: Ew . Oscar . What the fuck ? !
OSCAR: Wait , I thought you said you were n't with Cameron anymore .
ALLYSON: Does n't mean I want- Get away from me .
OSCAR: I thought you were sending me signals .
ALLYSON: Definitely no signals . Just go !
EMBARRASSED: I 'm sorry . Please do n't tell Cameron I did that . I did n't feel anything either . She stops and turns to face him .
ALLYSON: You 're disgusting . I 'm going home . You need to figure your shit out . She walks off . Leaves him standing there .
TO HIMSELF: I 'm drunk . Like really drunk , and I got all horny at the party , I was dancing with some girl , this way out of my league girl and my ain got all sexed up , and he tits got me totally chubbed out when she was feeding me guacamole in sexy ways
AARON: Oscar ? ! ! Oscar ? ! In the darkness , she arrives at the fence .
ALLYSON: Help me ! ! Open the door ! Another light switches on in a window .
SHANAH: Hello ? - Allyson ? - Thank God you 're all right . Where are you ? !
ALLYSON: Officer ! I saw him . My friend was attacked ! He came out of nowhere-
OFFICER HAWKINS: Take a deep breath , Allyson . You 're going to be all right . Take a deep eath .
OFFICER FRANCIS: We 'll drop you off and wait at the gate for your girl to arrive . We have an officer on the scene in contact with her now . They enter .
RAY: Home is where the heart is , right Laurie ?
LAURIE: I saw your mousetraps , Ray . Peanut utter and marshmallow fluff ?
RAY: What 's this ?
SHANAH: My childhood .
LAURIE: It 's how we protect ourselves .
OFFICER HAWKINS: 601 to dispatch . I 'm 1076 with a witness in custody .
THROUGH RADIO: Copy 601 . Be advised . Suspect last eported on 11th Avenue , South of Bypass .
ALLYSON: I have n't been to her house in years , but I think I can give you directions from the- Allyson 's eye strain . She POINTS AND SCREAMS
CALMLY: Brace yourself .
DR. SARTAIN: He 's alive . Hawkins raises his gun .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Not for long . Stand back .
DR. SARTAIN: Officer Hawkins , do not kill my patient .
OFFICER HAWKINS: I 'm finishing this .
DR. SARTAIN: Do n't move , Young lady . Do not scream . Stay where you are .
ALLYSON: Please Do n't .
WHISPERS: This is a dream . Allyson watches out the window . She panics .
ALLYSON: No ! please no ! Please !
DR. SARTAIN: Make room , my dear . Mindful of my patient .
TO ALLYSON: I do n't believe he hears everything . Allyson pushes The Shape off of her .
DR. SARTAIN: Michael , I see why you are who you are . The sensation is obvious . The thrill is exhilarating . Loomis was a coward . He was afraid to travel to such depths for you . But I love you and I know you feel the same way . I freed you from those unwilling to understand you . Those of archaic mind . Allyson is desperate .
ALLYSON: Let me go . Please .
DR. SARTAIN: The look on your face when you saw freedom ? And then the carnage and confusion we created ?
DESPERATE: Please Where are you taking me ? ! Sartain chuckles and keeps driving .
OFFICER RICHARDS: You know what sounds good with a aloney sandwich ? Francis see something in the distance .
DISTRACTED: What the hell ?
DR. SARTAIN: What greater spectacle than to eunite two old friends . Michael Myers and Laurie Strode . A historical reunion . The back seat settles . All is quiet until
OFFICER FRANCIS: Let 's check it out . Officer Richards puts the car in gear .
OFFICER HAWKINS: Hawkins , please respond .
DR. SARTAIN: But you said I could watch .
OFFICER HAWKINS: It 's him .
OVER SPEAKER: Hands where I can see ` um ! DO N'T
SHANAH: I 'm scared . I do n't know how to do this .
LAURIE: You never wanted to listen when I spoke about that night but this is why . We fight to survive . He is a killer . But he will be killed tonight . I 've been preparing fo this for a long time . And whethe you know it or not , so have you .
RAY: Any word on Allyson ? No response .
LAURIE: Ray ?
SHANAH: Mom ?
LAURIE: He 's here Shanah . Michael is here . Go to the shelter and hide . You 'll e safe there .
SHANAH: What about Ray ? What about Allyson ?
LAURIE: I 'll take care of it . It 's time . Now . It all ends tonight .
ALLYSON: I 'm not leaving without you .
LAURIE: You must . Go now . I love you .
ALLYSON: Grandmother ? !
LAURIE: Kill it . Kill it . It must die . Her whispers fall on deaf ears .
JAMIE: Oh , God , it 's coming ! It 's coming !
KARA: Danny !
DANNY: The voice man ! He 's here !
KARA: Danny , no one 's there .
JOHN: Some of us have to get some sleep around here . What 's with that kid ?
DEBRA: Let me take him for you , Kara .
KARA: It 's all right , Mom . Go back to bed .
DANNY: Mommy , when can we go home ?
KARA: Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa 's new house . At least while I 'm in college . Remember our deal .
DANNY: The kids at school said this is a haunted house that a bad man used to live here .
KARA: They did , did they ? Since when did we start listening to the kids at school ?
DANNY: But I 've seen him !
KARA: You 've been watching too much TV .
DANNY: He says things . Bad things .
KARA: Like what ? Danny is afraid to tell her .
DANNY: No , Mom keep it on !
KARA: Okay But just for tonight .
TOMMY: My name 's Tommy . I was only eight- years-old
MARY: Come with me if you want to save your baby .
JAMIE: Oh , God He 's coming !
MARY: We 've got to move . Now !
MARY: There ! It 's that way !
JAMIE: No
MARY: Save your baby go now !
MOTORIST: Shit !
DWAYNE: Harry , you 're too much . I 'd just like to say that I understand how things have changed in the 90 's . Gays in the military , cut off you husband 's do- jigger , become a national hero . But I just ca n't see any sense in bringing Halloween back to Haddonfield .
JAMIE: Drive ! Goddamnit , drive !
MOTORIST: Hey , what do you think you 're
LOOMIS: Not dead . Just very much retired .
WYNN: Christ , what a night ! Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road !
LOOMIS: That 's the whole idea of living in the country . I thrive on the seclusion .
WYNN: Unlike you , Sam , I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man . Remember what Freud said 'Sometimes a ciga is just a cigar . ' Or , in this case , a drink is just a drink .
WYNN: As always , your keen powers of perception astound me . And you 're right . I 've come to celebrate . After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator , guess who has been named Smith 's Groves new Chief of Staff .
LOOMIS: But surely Rogers is n't
WYNN: Retiring .
LOOMIS: You should know that it 's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me .
WYNN: You 're the only man for the job , Sam . Things have n't been the same since you left . I 'm ecruiting the best psychiatric team in the
LOOMIS: Even after my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a gun to my head to get me to retire . Now things have changed . I 've changed . The ghosts have been buried . Why on earth would I want to dig them up again ?
WYNN: Seems to me there 's at least one ghost that 's still lurking in your closet .
JAMIE: God Help us , please
WYNN: But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone , you 'd make the rules . Just think it over .
TALL MAN: Are you all right , young lady ?
JOHN: Enough of this Michael Myers shit !
LOOMIS: It was her voice . On the radio . It was Jamie . Calling for me .
WYNN: You do n't know that for sure . It could have een anyone . A practical joke . Kids .
LOOMIS: It was Jamie Lloyd . She came back , as I knew she would one day . And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well .
WYNN: After six years ? Sam , she died with him in that explosion after the
WYNN: Cancel all my appointments . Get Dr. Loomis anything he needs files , tests , records of every treatment ever administered to a forme patient of ours Michael Myers .
DAWN: Michael Myers ?
WYNN: That 's right . We think there 's a very good chance he might still be alive .
LOOMIS: Or what 's left of him .
TIM: Bro ' , I knew Harry when we lived in the city . Do n't worry he 'll be there . We 've got everything arranged . Get with me tonight at the fair and I 'll hook you up . Peace .
JOHN: Shitheads Defacing my property . I showed them
DEBRA: Relax , John . They were just kids .
JOHN: Kids are what 's ruining this country . Everywhere you go , it 's the same . No goddamn espect .
DEBRA: You 'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach , Kara . Debra snatches the book out of Kara 's hands .
KARA: It 's called psychology , Mom . Living in this house is what 's driving me crazy .
KARA: I 'd better get Danny to school .
JOHN: She do n't show her face for five years , then expects us to roll out the red carpet . You think going to college is gon na make up fo your mistakes , girl ?
DEBRA: John , please do n't
TIM: Yo ' , just lay off her , Dad .
JOHN: What the fuck
KARA: Let 's go , Danny .
DEBRA: Kara , wait . John . Ca n't we all just sit down ? Try to be a family for once ?
KARA: I 'm sorry , Mom .
JOHN: That 's it , Debra , keep slipping her the cash .
KARA: Stay away from her , you bastard .
JOHN: I only see one bastard in this house .
TIM: Dad ! Let her go !
DEBRA: John ! Stop it ! Stop it !
BETH: Make way for the Hardin County Express . Hey , where 's Tim ? We 're supposed to go ove the list of events for tonight
KARA: Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best ' at the Strode house .
BETH: Pig . What the hell happened this time ?
TIM: Shit , Beth , why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin ' fair ? It 's only Halloween .
BETH: How many times o I have to tell you ? It 's not about Halloween . It 's about being political . There are too many people with corn-cobs up their ass in this town telling us what we can
JOHN: I want her and that kid out of here tonight . Debra rises , facing him scornfully .
DEBRA: I thought inheriting your father 's house the business moving out here might change things . But you 're still the same , John .
TIM: Whatever happened to women in back ?
BETH: Reality check , dillweed . This is 1995 .
BETH: Why ? You interested ?
BETH: You mean Tommy . Yeah , on the weirdness scale he 's about an eleven . Supposedly some scary
TIM: Or horny .
KARA: Tim , do you always have to act like such an asshole ?
TIM: Only when you 're around to dump on Hey , chill , sis . I 'm just doggin ' ya .
BETH: Speed kills , asshole !
KARA: Who is that
BETH: I 've got my pepper spray .
TIM: Happy fuckin ' Halloween .
ATTENDANT: Can I help you , sir ?
TOMMY: Can you tell me if a bus arrived from Russellville last night ? The Attendant checks her roster .
TOMMY: Thank you .
WYNN: What is that ?
LOOMIS: It 's a sign . He 's come home .
DEPUTY: Sir , you 'll have to step back .
LOOMIS: Please . I need to see the sheriff .
WYNN: Official business .
DEPUTY: Wait here .
LOOMIS: You must be Sheriff Holdt .
HOLDT: As a matter of fact , I am . And I take it you 're the infamous Dr. Loomis .
HOLDT: Smith 's Grove . They told me you 'd be coming . Now I suggest you fly right on back to you
LOOMIS: Michael Myers is my business . Holdt towers above him .
HOLDT: I want you to listen and listen good , Loomis .
DEPUTY: Sheriff ! She 's alive !
LOOMIS: Dear God Jamie !
TIM: Yo , check it out . They 've been lining up all night just to see Harry . You lose your mind in that thing , Kara ?
KARA: I ca n't find my term paper .
BETH: Give us victory or give us death . See you tonight , Kara !
KARA: Thorn
PARAMEDIC: Penetrating abdominal trauma . Massive blood
DR. BONHAM: How can this girl still be alive ? ! Type and cross-match for another six units ! Get a CT scan and move her into surgery . And get them out of here !
WYNN: Sam , do n't let them take care of her .
LOOMIS: I 'm here now , Jamie . You 're going to live . You have to .
TOMMY: I need to see a doctor .
NURSE: What seems to be the problem ?
NURSE: What kind of an accident ?
TOMMY: Just get me a doctor right now !
WYNN: There 's nothing more you can do for her .
LOOMIS: Yes ?
TOMMY: Dr. Loomis , thank God you 're here . You heard her , did n't you ? It was Jamie .
LOOMIS: I 'm sorry , but do I know you
TOMMY: I 'm Tommy . Tommy Doyle . Laurie Strode Jamie 's mother she was baby-sitting for me that night
LOOMIS: Yes Tommy . What are you doing here ?
LOOMIS: What do you know about Michael ?
LOOMIS: Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life . She
TOMMY: No , Dr. Loomis . She 's not the last night .
LOOMIS: Tommy , wait !
WYNN: There you are . Who was that boy ?
LOOMIS: An old friend . Darkness fills Loomis 's countenance as we
DEBRA: Great .
LOOMIS: I 'm very sorry , Mrs. Strode .
DEBRA: Who are you ?
LOOMIS: I 've come to help your family .
TOMMY: Shhh . Okay , okay , Kyle . You like that name ? Yeah , I think it suits you .
LOOMIS: Michael Myers was just six-years-old when he stabbed his sister to death in 1963 . Here in this house . For the next fifteen years , I ecame obsessed with finding out what was living inside of him . He was my lift 's work and my ultimate failure . I knew what he was ut I never knew why .
IAN: Who 's my next victim ?
DEBRA: What makes you think he 'll come here again ?
LOOMIS: This house is sacred to him . It 's the source of his memories his rage . Mrs. Strode , I
DEBRA: Jamie ? But I thought she was
LOOMIS: Found this morning . In a field outside Haddonfield . Stabbed .
IAN: Double or nothing .
DEBRA: What should I do ?
LOOMIS: Lock the doors and call your husband . Get you family as far away from Haddonfield as possible .
DEBRA: God this ca n't be true .
JOHN: Strode Realty .
DEBRA: John , it 's me . Something terrible has happened . INTERCUT their conversation .

JOHN: Trick-or-treat to you , too .
DEBRA: Hello ? A startling , intensely whispering VOICE
KARA: Mom , I 'm home Hello ?

TOMMY: She was n't here when I brought Danny home from

BETH: That 's what worries me .
LOOMIS: Any word on the location of the Strodes ?
LOOMIS: What 's wrong ? What 's happened to Jamie ?
TOMMY: Quiet around here tonight , huh , Mrs. B. ? As usual , the senile old woman does n't reply .
DANNY: Mom , I want to go to the fair
KARA: You ca n't expect us to stay here
TOMMY: I want you to watch your house . You can see everything from this window . Kara glares , reminded of last night .
KARA: Do you know how insane this is ? Who am I supposed to be looking for ?
TOMMY: Him .

You took a shove and you let it go clean . Not good . That 's a formula for future abuse an invitation to the loser 's dance . Letting it go . Walking away . , Bad policy . Wo n't be long 'fore you 're unning , looking for a place to hide .

A fox and he 's walking through what , the woods , the forests , right ? Next thing the fox knows , he 's staring down a pack of hounds . Bloodhounds . And there 's this chase , the fox 's running his ass off , over boulders and through streams and , ut the damn hounds are still on his tail . Finally the fox comes to this cliff , a precipice and it 's what , a seven hundred foot drop onto jagged ocks . He 's in trouble 'cause the hounds are closing in and they 're going to tea him to pieces . So what does he think `` I jump and I die for sure . I stay , confront them and I 'll get my ass utchered . '' Decision time . He thinks , `` stay and least I 'd have something , a chance .
BEAT: The hounds come . What do you think happens ?
AARON: He gets away .
HANCOCK: No . The fox gets his ass kicked and some I mean ripped apart by the dogs , like cheap fabric .
AARON: What 're you saying ?
HANCOCK: But you know , when the last hound was through with him , -and he 's walking away , he hears this noise . It 's the fox and he 's muttering something under his eath words . The dog goes over . Gets up close . To hear what he 's saying . You know what the fox 's saying just before he keels off ? Aaron - negative .
CONTINUING: Now he 's gurgling , choking on his own lood , right ? A massacre . The fox 's lying next to his entrails , you know and you know what he says ? `` No regrets . ''
AARON: What ?
HANCOCK: No regrets . You make a decision and you stick to it . Like a man 's got to do . And `` no regrets . '' Aaron - submitting it to memory .
AARON: Why 're you telling me all this ?
HANCOCK: Look at it this way I got to do what I got to do .

CONTINUING: so , a job ? Yes . And no . It 's about essence . The essence of the man not his clothes . It 's the job . Take away the arm , . the leg , his bodily possessions ut not his trade , his profession . That case , you strip him of what he is a man . Horus a firm grasp of the concept .

REACTS: No there 's no shame in it . The crying . It 's relief we 're older and we do n't remembe when we go , `` God , when was the last time ? '' Maybe it 's me . It 's more an effort , now . Takes more pain more lood . Like it 's , do you have the time anymore ? Even to look back and recall a moving experience . To be moved .

ATASHIR: There is no Doug Billings at any of the area hospitals , morgues , o police stations . The guys frown , starting to grow worried .

STU: Or shopping ?
ALAN: Great . So we 've officially lost Doug . His wedding is in what , 22 hours ?

VICK: Well , we started on the roof
ALAN: Right , that was like , 6ish ?

VICK: That sounds right Stu throws up his arms , already giving up .
STU: Okay , honestly ? I do n't even emember going to dinner .
VICK: I vaguely recalldoing body shots .at some point ? Is thatmaybe ?
ALAN: I 'm pretty much blank after The Hard Rock .
VICK: I think we went to the Flamingo after that ? And then , I just emember a lot of blue lightand the overpowering smell of baby oil .
ALAN: So that was what , 10ish ?

STU: Yeah , totally ! There 's no way we went there ! We 're not gay ! Hahaha !
ALAN: I think we should call Tracy .
VICK: Absolutely not .
ALAN: What if Doug called her ? She might know where he is .
STU: Yeah , I 'm with Alan on this one .
VICK: Of course you 're with Alan , you 're oth gutless cowards . But we 're not calling Tracy . You never call the ide from the bachelor party . Ever . If my balls were on fire and Tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water , I still would n't call her . It 's a rule .
ALAN: But should n't we at least tell he we 're gon na be getting home late ?
VICK: She has a watch , she 'll figure it out .

ALAN: I 'm sure there 's a perfectly logical explanation for this
STU: Really ? ! What ? ! Alan tries to think of one .
ALAN: Yeah , maybe there is n't .
VICK: Look , I 'm sure Roger is a very nice , considerate young man
STU: Oh my God , guys what if I 'm gay ? !
VICK: Come on , Stu , you 're nowhere nea cool enough .
STU: I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids !

VICK: Unbelievable .
ALAN: What ? ! I was a good-looking kid !
VICK: Please , you 're so not his type !
STU: Wait , what ?
VICK: Look , Stu , one homosexual experience does n't mean you 're permanently gay , okay ? A lot of guys test the waters .
ALAN: All right , we 're scaring the children . Let 's go .
STU: Wait so have either of you tested the waters ?
VICK: No ! We 're not gay !
STU: How am I going to tell my wife ?
VICK: Quickly , and from a great distance .
STU: Jesus , what kind of father am I ?
ALAN: Oh my God .
STU: You think Erin will try to take the kids ?
ALAN: OhmyGod .
VICK: What now ?
STU: Cool ring . Also , my Dad is gon na have a field day with this .
VICK: Oh my God Oh my God

ALAN: Seriously what am I gon na tell Becky ? For 14 years she 's been egging me to get married
VICK: Well , now you did . Just not to her .
ALAN: Wait , is that homeless guy wearing Doug 's shirt ?
STU: Naaah .
VICK: Yeah , that was a different shirt .
ALAN: What if they do n't remember us ?
STEVE: How are you , you dumb bastards ? !
VICK: Does the pope wear a funny hat ? ! Let 's do this thing !
STEVE: And where is Chastity today ? They all sit on white plastic chairs .
ALAN: W-Who'sChastity ?
LAUGHING: Your wife , man ! AWW , you 're just eaking my balls !
VICK: Uh , it was such a lovely ceremony , was n't it ?
STEVE: Hand to God , I 've never seen two people more in love !
VICK: Sadly , I believe you
ALAN: I am nevereverdrinking again .
STU: Jesus , she is stacked .
VICK: Stu , please , show some class . That 's Alan 's wife you 're talking about .
STU: Sorry . She looks really nice .
ALAN: We got a unicorn ? !
STEVE: Oh , yeah , you got the entire Double Camelot Package . Alan just rubs his temples , oh no .
ALAN: A-And how much did that cost ?
STEVE: 7 thousand dollars .
ALAN: I 'm gon na kill you !

CARLA: Ahhh ! I 'm just busting your nuts !
VICK: It 's good to be seen , Carla . It 's good to be seen .
CARLA: I brought the rest of your package .
STU: No way ! Awesome !
STEVE: A hundred DVDs of the ceremony
VICK: For you and Chastity to watch on your anniversary
CARLA: The velvet wall hanging
VICK: And it looks like real velvet , Alan , so no machine wash , okay ?
CARLA: And the big finish
STU: I want a shield !
VICK: Me too ! Hey , can Stu and I get a shield ?
ALAN: I do n't suppose you have any sort of return policy , do you ?
STEVE: Umif you know another couple who looks exactly like you guys , and who want two dozen commuter mugs , a wall hanging , and a shieldsure .
ALAN: What .
VICK: That 's his girlfriend of 14 years . I 'm sure this 'll only take a minute
ALAN: No ! I-I have no idea !
BECKY: `` Your best man ? ! '' What 's going on there , Alan ? !
ALAN: Nothing ! Baby , nothing , the GUYS
BECKY: I really do n't appreciate being mocked right now , Alan , especially about wedding-related issues . You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me .
ALAN: I know , baby ! I know
BECKY: So you 'll call the credit card company and straighten this out ?
ALAN: Yes . I will . I promise .
BECKY: Okay . Okay Look , sorry I 'm so tense I 'll see you soon , okay ? Love you .
ALAN: Yes , no , I love you too !
STU: Hey , how 's Becky doing , man ? !
VICK: Yeah , did she ask about us ? ! Off of Alan 's hate-filled glare , we
STU: Look on the bright side , Alan . Vick found a great clue .
VICK: Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos , which means if the time stamp was right we had him in our possession until 11 pm .
STU: That 's another hour of last night that we can account for . Is n't that great ?
ALAN: Amazing .
VICK: Hey , Steve , you do n't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night , do you ?
STEVE: Well , the Double Camelot Package comes with a five course wedding feast , so I assume you went there .
STU: Great where was the feast ?
STEVE: Sbarro , over in the Fremont mall .
VICK: Your negativity is like a little lack cloud over our car , Alan . You 've got to let go of this .
ALAN: Let go of what , exactly , Vick ? ! The fact that I married a complete stranger last night ? Or that my girlfriend 's about to leave me ? O that I 'm broke ? Which one ? !
VICK: You 're broke ? I thought you were
ALAN: I know you think it 's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship , Vick , but I actually love Becky , okay ?
SINCERE: I-I honestly do n't know what I 'd do without herI really do n't
VICK: Alan . Honey . Have you considered , even for a second , that maybe the things we do when we 're drunk are what we secretly want to do ?
ALAN: Yeah , no , you 're absolutely right , Vick , I 've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named Chastity !
STU: I ai n't mad atcha , dude
VICK: Or , after 14 years , maybe you do n't have the balls to leave Becky , and this is your way of getting her to leave you .
ALAN: I was going to propose to her this weekend , you jackass !
VICK: All the more reason to freak out .
ALAN: I swear to God , Vick , if you say one more word to me , I will destroy you .
STU: Guys , come on , let 's not use ou angry words
VICK: What the ? !
KALOLO FANALUA: Get out of the car , Vick . Stu and Alan recoil in terror .
STU: Who are these guys ? !
VICK: Stu , please . I think there 's been some sort of mistake , Mister ?
KALOLO FANALUA: I 'm Mr . Shut The Hell Up And Get The Hell Outta The Car , and this is my associate , Mr . Smash You In The Teeth If You Say Another Word .
VICK: Those so are n't their real names .
ALAN: Vick , do n't be a dick !
VICK: Alan ? Relax . These men are n't going to hurt us . They 're from Hawaii .
KALOLO FANALUA: We 're from Guam , bitch ! Now get outta the car !
VICK: Okay , okay ! Cool it with the bat ! Jesus , why is everyone trying to kill my car ?
ALAN: Why 'd you do that ? !
INCREDULOUS: Really ?
STU: Maybe they just wanted to talk !
VICK: I honestly do n't know how you two are still alive .
ALAN: Do you think we stole something from them last night ? !
STU: Oh my god I am such a bad dad !
ALAN: I 'm calling the police . This is getting way out of control
VICK: No ! No cops !
ALAN: `` No cops ? ! '' Who are you , Fitty Cent ? !
STU: Yeah , Vick , what 's going on ?
VICK: Nothing ! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing !
ALAN: Every little thing ? ! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza !
VICK: Oh please , those guys are from Guam . Get a grip .
ALAN: They knew your name , Vick ! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are , too !
STU: If anything ever happened to my family , Vick
VICK: Fine . Let 's just go back to the hotel Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night , we 'll get him , we 'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans , then we 'll get the hell ack to LA , okay ? Left turn .
ALAN: No messages .
STU: Come on , let 's toss the place .
VICK: Whoa .
STU: You think she 's what those Guamian dudes wanted ?
VICK: No . I think she 's Alan 's wife .
ALAN: Whatwhat am I supposed to do ?
STU: Wake her up , man !
ALAN: Why me ? !
VICK: Because she 's your spouse , dude !
CHASTITY: Dang , did I sleep in the closet again ?
STU: She seems really cool .
VICK: Yeah , I really like her , man .
STU: Yeah , are you Chastity Mervish now ?
ALAN: Listen to me . Justdid we , or did we not , have sex last night ? Alan braces , please say no , please say no
CHASTITY: Wellya ?
VICK: What a responsible , upstanding young Jew . They do n't make ` em like that anymore , am I right ?
CHASTITY: I know he even wanted to use a ubber . Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT .
ALAN: Wait we did n't use a condom ? !
CHASTITY: It 's cool , I sponge . Alan leans against a wall , dizzy .
ALAN: Can someoneplease open a window ?
STU: They do n't open .
CHASTITY: So you guys do n't remember any of last night ?
VICK: Yeah , not so much .
CHASTITY: Hey , been there before , right ? Sucks , though . The wedding was eally fun . I 'm bummed you do n't emember it , Alan .
STU: Dude , I think your wife 's mad at you .
VICK: You do n't happen to remember what time we met you last night , do you ?
CHASTITY: Sure , we met at the bar at like 10 00 ? Then we got married on my smoke break , which was like 11 00 ?
VICK: It 's the All-American love story , is n't it ? What happened next ?
CHASTITY: Well , I had to go back to work . But when I got off at 5 30 , I met up with you guys back here .
VICK: And was Doug with us then ?
CHASTITY: No .
VICK: Interesting Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding ?
CHASTITY: No , but I bet some of my work friends do . You were partying with them pretty hard .
STU: Work friends ?
ALAN: You work here ?
CHASTITY: Yeah and this is the pole where we first met !
ALAN: Look , I do n't know how to tell you this , but
STU: Dude .

CHASTITY: These were my bridesmaids , Anastasia and Starr !
STARR: Hey , boys ! Good to see you again !
ANASTASIA: Mazel Tov !
ALAN: Pleasedo n't .
CHASTITY: Oh my God , he 's playing our song ! This song was playing when we met , emember ? ! You kept sliding twenties into my thong and saying `` I will always love you . I will always love you . '' Alan closes his eyes .
ALAN: Twenties ?
CHASTITY: Yeah , it was so sweet
ALAN: Look , I do n't know how to say this , ut my friends and I were very drunk last night . We would neve come to a place like this
VICK: You are the best bridesmaids ever .
STU: Dude I might not be gay .
ALAN: What the hell are you doing ? !
VICK: Two-for-ones , man .
ALAN: We do n't have time for this ! We got ta find Doug !
VICK: What do you think we 're doing ?
ALAN: What ?
VICK: We 're getting into the mindset of last night , to see if it sparks any memories . Now is this exactly how you were dancing for me last night , Starr ? She nods . Vick nods , pensive , scientific .
ALAN: You are so goddamn selfish , Vick . You really are . Stu , let 's go .
VICK: No . Stu , sit and enjoy your dance . Stu looks between them , torn .
ALAN: Dude Doug is missing ! We have less than 18 hours til his wedding ! We do not have time for this !
VICK: I 'm trying to save your life here , Alan Mervish .
ALAN: Vick !
VICK: I 'm not kidding , man ! Life is one long series of emergencies , and if you do n't learn to stop and have a little fun along the way , you 're gon na grow into a joyless old prick like your dad . I 'm sorry to bring Moshe Mervish into it , but it had to be said . Now yes , we have 18 hours to find Doug which means we can afford to spend ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young body-artists . So sit down , have a jager shot , and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life . Chastity , honey ? When you 're ready ?
ALAN: No , look I am like totally against this , morally and politically . Plus Becky specifically asked me not to
STU: I think I know why he married her .
VICK: Because if he had n't , I would 've . They continue watching on in silence .
STU: Is it weird that we 're sitting this close watching ?
VICK: Not for me . More watching in silence .
STU: I really should n't be here . I have daughters . Then both of their heads angle the same way .
VICK: Not that can do that .
STU: How can she do that without dislocating her hip ?
VICK: Because she 's been touched by God .
ALAN: Whoa , whoa , I 'm smelling the roses
VICK: Come on , man ! We got company !
CHASTITY: Come on ! The guys race after her
STU: Did she just do that in heels ? !
VICK: I 'm really starting to like this girl .
STU: Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese businessmen ? ! I think they killed like four of them !
VICK: Come on , Alan tell me that was n't just a little fun
ALAN: That wasa little fun .
SCARED: Y-Yes ? !
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: Where were you last night at 3am ?
VICK: No idea .
OFFICER BLADEN: Okay , how about at 2am ?
VICK: Ditto . Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist .
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: You think this is cute , son ? ! You think this is a game ? !
ALAN: Whatever we did , we 're so sorry !
STU: Honestly , man , I will confess to anything you want !
VICK: Stu stop talking . Alan sit up straight . Officer Merriweather , I 've told you twelve times now we have no memory of last night . Now either charge us with a crime , o let us go .
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: What do you know about Jimmy Lang ?
ALAN: Nothing ?
STU: Who is he ?
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang- Xi crime organization , and is wanted in seven states for money laundering , drug smuggling , acketeering and murder .
ALAN: Oh my god
STU: Did we kill someone last night ? !
VICK: We have no idea who this man is .
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: Is that right ?
VICK: Yeah , that 's right .
STU: We 're in a lot of trouble , are n't we .
ALAN: Officers , I swear , we have no memory of that ever occurring
OFFICER BLADEN: Okay . Maybe a night in jail will jostle something loose .
STU: Oh no , sir , please do n't !
ALAN: We have a very important wedding !
VICK: I know Jimmy Lang . Everyone stops , looks at Vick .
ALAN: You do ? !
VICK: Jimmy and I tried to raise capital for Girl-nasium , a 24 hour fitness center and day spa for tween-age girls , but it never got off the ground . It was an entirely legitimate enterprise I had no idea he was a criminal . We must 've umped into him last night , and he must 've invited us to join his irthday celebration . No crime in that , is there , Officers ? Merriweather gets in Vick 's face , intense .
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: You actually expect me to believe that dung ?
UNBLINKING: Yes , Officer Merriweather . I do .
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: If I find out you 're lying to me , son , I will take all of you down , is that clear ?
OFFICER BLADEN: You boys would n't last three hours in prison .
VICK: Stu might . Stu shakes his head , unbelievable .
OFFICER BLADEN: Get outta here .
ALAN: Oh , thank you , Officers !
STU: It was really nice meeting you !
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER: If you know what 's good for you , you 'll get the hell out of Vegas .
ALAN: Did you have to be such a dick ? !
VICK: We got out , did n't we ?
ALAN: Yeah , four hours later ! If we 'd just cooperated with them
VICK: If we 'd cooperated with them , we 'd e in jail right now , Alan .
ALAN: What are we gon na do now ? We 've got zero leads on where Doug is !
STU: Why has n't he called ? It 's 8 30 . The guys shake their heads , I do n't know .
VICK: Stu , do n't . Doug is fine .
STU: I mean , we were hanging out with mobsters last night , man ! They kill people for looking at ` em weird !
VICK: Stu Doug is fine .
STU: Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert and left him , just as like a funny prank ? !
VICK: Stu ! Enough !
MUTTERING: I knew I should n't have come
VICK: What did you just say ?
ALAN: I said I knew I should n't have come this weekend , Vick !
VICK: Is that right ?
ALAN: Yeah , that 's right . I only came ecause Doug insisted . Vick steps towards Alan , heated .
VICK: Why do think you 're so much bette than us , dude ? !
ALAN: I do n't I just think I 'm bette than you , Vick ! And trust me , it 's not that hard ! You have n't changed one bit since high school ! Jesus , you 're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops ? ! Really ? !
VICK: You 're out of your depth , Alan
ALAN: And you 're still the one getting us in trouble ! Only then it was hiding your weed in our locker , and now you 've got us partying with wanted felons ! It 's not cute anymore , man ! We 're too old for this ! Vick scowls ; this is actually hitting home
STU: Okay , let 's all take a breath
ALAN: When 's the last time you had a real job , man ? ! When 's the last time you had a girlfriend ? ! Hell , when 's the last time you picked up the check ? !
VICK: What 's so great about any of those things ? !
ALAN: Those `` things , '' Vick , are what grown men do ! Vick swallows , furious .
STU: Look , we 're all tired and hungry
VICK: None of us ever liked you , Alan ! We only hung out with you because Doug made us !
ALAN: Stu ? Is that true ?
VICK: Why would anyone like you , dude ? Have you ever thought about that ? You 're uptight , you 're judgemental , you 're cheap , and yet somehow you think you 're sweeter than everyone else ! Well look around , man no one wants to be you ! I 'd rather be Stu than you !
STU: Wait , what ?
ALAN: I'vealwayshated you
VICK: You punch likeyour sister
STU: Hey , no ! Time out ! We all need a time out !
CHASTITY: That might not be like , the smartest place to fight ?
STU: Good call on happy hour , Chastity . These tacos kick ass .
CHASTITY: Yeah , I always come here when I get out of jail . The guys exchange a quick look .
ALAN: Hey how 'd you start Vick 's car ?
CHASTITY: Oh , my daddy taught me how to hotwire almost anything .
VICK: That 's funny , because Alan 's daddy taught him tax law .
ALAN: And Vick 's daddy taught him how to get really drunk at his kid 's soccer games and then piss himself .
VICK: It 's a disease , dude !
STU: Guys , come on ! For Doug ?
ALAN: What if it 's Doug ?
VICK: What if it 's Tracy ? !
STU: Good evening , this is Stu !
TRACY: Stu , it 's Tracy !
STU: It 's Tracy ! Vick glares at Alan . Alan looks away , shit .
VICK: Because she knows you 're the most easily tricked .
ALAN: We have tell her we lost Doug .
VICK: No we do n't ! Tell her nothing , Stu ! Stu turns back to the phone , rattled .
STU: Hey , Trace ! W-What 's going on ?
TRACY: Oh , nothing , just here with my family
STU: Wow , that sounds amazing !
TRACY: Yeah ? Hey , you would n't happen to know where Doug is , would you ? He said he 'd be home by 5 for this dinner , and now it 's almost 9 00 . I tried his cell , but he did n't answer
STU: Ummmm..Hang on . She wants to know where Doug is !
VICK: I 'm working on it ! Buy us some time !
ALAN: No , just tell her the truth ! Honesty is always the best policy !
VICK: What are you , retarded ? ! Honesty is never the best policy ! Especially not with brides !
STU: Um , what 'd you say ?
FROWNING: I asked if you knew where Doug was .
STU: Yeah , um , hang on . She still wants to know !
VICK: Okay tell her Alan got really drunk last night and fell down , and the doctor said not to move him fo a few hours , but that we 'll be back in time for the wedding .
ALAN: Why do I have to be the one that fell over drunk ? !
VICK: It 's a fictitious canard , Alan , get over yourself ! Stu tell her !
VICK: Fell over drunk .
STU: H-He was drunk . And the doctor a different doctor , not the one he fell on he said we could n't move him until the wedding
VICK: For a few hours ! We 'll be home efore the wedding !
STU: But we 're going to have the wedding at your home Tracy just looks really confused .
VICK: Tracy ? ! Vick ! How are ya , hon ?
TRACY: Vick , what is going on ?

ALAN: What 's going on , Vick ? Vick stammers , trying to find the words
JIMMY LANG: Six months ago , your friend Vick orrowed some money from me at what can only be described as a very unfavorable interest rate .

STU: Come on , Vick
VICK: No , man , it 's true ! I put on a good show , but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely , it scares me , man . I-I do n't know how much longer I can keep this scam going . And now I 've gone and ruined the one good thing I had
STU: Come on , man , we 've been bro 's since third grade , it 's gon na take a lot more than money to ruin ou friendship . Vick looks down , deeply touched

CHASTITY: I 'm so sorryabout everything .

ALAN: Yep , just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters , what could possibly go wrong ? The guys all frown .

VICK: We 're gon na give Jimmy a dummy bag of money , grab Doug , and make a run for it .
ALAN: Yes , good ! What an airtight plan !

DR. ABEL: What I 'd like to do , is to make an appointment for you at the hospital . I 'd like to have them run some tests .

DR. GREY: I was n't too happy with the results of your ENG or your BSER either .
MICKEY: A brain scan ?
DR. GREY: Mr. Sachs , let 's take one step at a time . We wo n't make any decisions until we have all the information in front of us , all right ?
DR. SMITH: I 'm sorry to say , Mr. Sachs , that you can not have children .
MICKEY: Gee .
HANNAH: Is there no chance ?
DR. SMITH: Well , naturally , this does n't mean that you ca n't have a normal sex life . But Mr. Sachs 's tests indicate that he is infertile . Small sperm volume and infertile .
MICKEY: Is n't there anything I can do ? Push-ups or hormones ?
DR. SMITH: I 'm afraid not .
MICKEY: Well , I got ta get a second opinion .
HANNAH: This is the second opinion .
MICKEY: Well , then a third opinion .
DR. SMITH: I realize this is a blow . My experience is that many very fine marriages become unstable and are destroyed by an inability to deal with this sort of problem . I hope you wo n't make too much of it . One can adopt children , and there are various artificial methods of fertilization .
MICKEY: I 'm so humiliated . I do n't know what to say . I mean
HANNAH: Could you have ruined yourself somehow ?
MICKEY: How could I ruin myself ? What do you mean , ruin myself ?
HANNAH: I do n't know . Excessive masturbation ?
MICKEY: Hey , you gon na start knocking my hobbies ? Jesus !
HANNAH: Well , what about artificial insemination ?
MICKEY: What are you talking about ?
HANNAH: You know , where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor .
MICKEY: What , by a st-stranger ?
HANNAH: Yeah , they have these banks , you know , where they keep them frozen .
MICKEY: Fro ? You want a-a defrosted kid ? Is that your idea ?
HANNAH: I want to experience childbirth .
MICKEY: With a , with a stranger ? With a
HANNAH: Just think about it . That 's all I ask .
CAROL: Oh , that was a wonderful show . I think that 's the best show you two ever wrote .
NORMAN: No , the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for .
MICKEY: YeahI-I think as , I think as fa as laughs , I mean just plain laughs , you know , that was probably the best thing that we ever did .
NORMAN: Mm-hm .
CAROL: Yeah , it was funny , it was very funny . But the show was about the two Frenchmen , now that was funny and it was warm .
NORMAN: We got that idea on that trip to Paris .
CAROL: Right .
NORMAN: Hmm ?
CAROL: Do you remember that summer in France ? Hannah , you had jet lag for six straight weeks . Norman chuckles .
MICKEY: Yeah , but it was , you know , I guess we had fun when we were there and , you know , it 's just , I
NORMAN: Mm-hm .
HANNAH: Sorry . Coffee ? Listen , you guys , we were You want some more ?
NORMAN: Mmm .
HANNAH: We-wewe had something we-we eally wanted to discuss with you .
MICKEY: Yeah
NORMAN: I 'm all ears .
MICKEY: Hannah and Ica n't have any children . Now I-I-I do n't want to get into whose fault it It 's my fault that we ca n't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to
HANNAH: W-w-we-we 've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we 'd try with artificial insemination .
MICKEY: Yeah , I 'm not so sure that I , that I like that idea myself , anyway He starts to pace behind the couch anew .
HANNAH: Um , I-I did n't really want to , you know , go to a sperm bank o something , have some anonymous donor . I-I just , you know , I-I-I would n't want that .
MICKEY: Right . We felt that if we were gon na do it , that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and Norman and Carol remain silent .
HANNAH: And you can say no you know . Feel free to say no . W-we realize it has all kinds of implications .
MICKEY: Yeah , but the-the point that , uh , that we 're making here is that we need some sperm .
NORMAN: Gee . Well My first reaction after the initial shock is , uh , flattered that you would ask me . Carol glances at Norman .
MICKEY: Yeah , well , I would be the father . You would just have to masturbate into a little cup .
NORMAN: I can handle that .
HANNAH: Obviously we wou-would n't have intercourse . She chuckles nervously .
CAROL: Gosh , listen . I 've got ta tell you the truth here . I 'm a little uneasy about this .
HANNAH: Carol , I know it 's a lot to ask .
CAROL: WellI feel for you . I do . II 'm gon na cry . You want my husband to have a child with you ?
HANNAH: Ye D-d-d-do n't answer now . Just , you know , take it home and think about it for a while .
NORMAN: I gave blood before and , uh clothing to the poor .
CAROL: Okay , Norman , listen , I really want to talk about this at home . I think it 's a matter for you analystand mine .
NORMAN: And maybe my lawyer . He takes a sip of coffee .
HANNAH: You know , we-we understand completely if , you know , if you feel you'd-you 'd rather not . I did n't mean to spoil the evening . Now let 's move on to another topic .

EVAN: Always .
HANNAH: Hi , Mom . How you doing ? Here , let me get you some coffee . That 's enough of that . What triggered it ?
EVAN: We were making a commercial down at the mayor 's office , and there was this young , good-looking salesman
NORMA: Liar ! Liar !
EVAN: Then at lunch she got drunker and drunke and finally she became Joan Collins !
NORMA: All my life I 've had to put up with insults
EVAN: I can only hope that she was mine . With you as her mothe her father could be anybody in Actors ' Equity !
NORMA: She 's talentedso it 's not likely she 's yours !
HANNAH: Dad , could you just please stay in the other room and let me take care of her ?
EVAN: You never know when she 's going to fall off the wagon and humiliate everybody .
HANNAH: Here , Mom . Drink this . You know , you 're awful . You probably were flirting .
NORMA: No ! I like to joke around and have fun , and he gets angry because I get the attention . He 's gotten sourer as he 's gotten older , and I 've tried to stay youngat heart .
HANNAH: You promised to stay on the wagon .
NORMA: The sacrifices I 've made because of that man . He 's ruined me with his ego , his philandering , his his-his-his-his mediocrity !
HANNAH: Okay , stop being so dramatic .
NORMA: He 's the one that 's made every ingenue in stock !
HANNAH: Okay , okay .
NORMA: Th-th-they , they wanted me for a screen test .
HANNAH: Yeah , I know , Mom .
NORMA: But I , I knew that he 'd get up there and he 'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes . He 's all show ! Now how can you act when there 's nothing inside to come out ? !
HANNAH: Ohhh , my true gift is luck , Mom . Norma chuckles .
NORMA: Yes , she 's lovely , but she does n't have your spark . She knows it . She worships you . She would n't dare get up there on the stage .
HANNAH: Now , Holly 's not shy .
NORMA: No , Holly 's game for anything . Holly takes after me .
HANNAH: True .
NORMA: I 'd have been a great dope addict .
EVAN: Remember this , Hannah ?
DR. BROOKS: Mr. Sachs , I 'm afraid the news is not good . Dr. Brooks turns to an offscreen Mickey .

But eventually , I 'm going to be in that position .
GAIL: You 're just realizing this now ?

ELLIOT: I 've wanted to call you everyday since I first told you how I felt .
LEE: I know it is n't .
ELLIOT: I do n't want anyone else ever to have you .
LEE: I was so worried I would n't compare with Hannah .

ELLIOT: Yes , she 's , she 's very warm , but , ut it-it 's me that wants to be giving to you . I-I-I want to do things for you . Hannah does n't need me as much . I 'm being presumptuous . Not that you need me .
LEE: I want you to take care of me And I love when you do things to me .
FREDERICK: You 're late .
LEE: Lucy and I kept talking , and I did n't realize how late it had gotten .
FREDERICK: You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz . More gruesome film clipsand more puzzled intellectuals declaring thei mystification over the systematic murder of millions .
LEE: I have a little headache from this weather . She takes a kettle and fills it with water .
FREDERICK: It 's been ages since I sat in front of the TV just changing channels to find something .
LEE: Oh , God , Frederick , could you please lighten up ? ! I 'm really not in the mood to hear a review of contemporary society again .
FREDERICK: You know , you 've been very nervous lately .

FREDERICK: I 'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago .
LEE: I 'm not your pupil . I was , but I 'm not .
FREDERICK: When you leave the nest , I just want you to be ready to face the eal world . He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed .

APRIL: Look , it 's just an evening at the opera . Did I , I-I do wrong in accepting ? Holly looks away sadly ; she shakes her head .
FATHER FLYNN: Now why do you think that you would like to convert to Catholicism ?
MICKEY: Well , uh , because , y-you know , I got ta have something to believe in , otherwise life is just meaningless .
FATHER FLYNN: I understand . But why did you make the decision to choose the Catholic faith ?
MICKEY: Tch . Well , y-you knowfirst of all , because it 's a very beautiful eligion . It 's very well structured . Now I 'm talking now , incidentally , about the-the , uh , against-school- prayer , pro-abortion , anti-nuclea wing .
FATHER FLYNN: So at the moment you do n't believe in God .
MICKEY: No . A-a-and I-I want to . You know , I'm-I 'm willing to do anything . I 'll , you know , I 'll dye Easte eggs if it works . I-I need some evidence . I got ta have some proof . Uh , you know , i- i-if I ca n't believe in God then I do n't think life is worth living .
FATHER FLYNN: It means making a very big leap . Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap .
MICKEY: Yes , well , can-can you help me ?
MOTHER: Why ? Oh , my God !
MICKEY: I do n't understand . I thought that you would be happy .
FATHER: How can we be happy ?
MICKEY: Well , because I never thought of God in my life . Now I 'm giving it serious thought .
FATHER: But Catholicism ? Why not your own people ?
MICKEY: Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing , you know . B-b- -but I need a dramatic change in my life .
FATHER: You 're gon na believe in Jesus Christ ?
MICKEY: I know it sounds funny , but I 'm gon na try .
FATHER: But why ? We raised you as a Jew .
MICKEY: So , just 'cause I was born that way You know , I 'm old enough to make a mature decision .
FATHER: But why Jesus Christ ? Why , fo instance , should n't you become a Buddhist ?
MICKEY: A Bud ? That 's totally alien to me . Look , you 're getting on in years , right ? Are n't you afraid of dying ?
FATHER: Why should I be afraid ?
MICKEY: Oh ! 'Cause you wo n't exist !
FATHER: So ?
MICKEY: That thought does n't terrify you ?
FATHER: Who thinks about such nonsense ? Now I 'm alive . When I 'm dead , I 'll e dead .
MICKEY: I do n't understand . Are n't you frightened ?
FATHER: Of what ? I 'll be unconscious .
MICKEY: Yeah , I know . But never to exist again !
FATHER: How do you know ?
MICKEY: Well , it certainly does n't look promising .
FATHER: Who knows what 'll be ?
MICKEY: Mom , come out !
MOTHER: Of course there 's a God , you idiot ! You do n't believe in God ?
MICKEY: But if there 's a God , then wh-why is there so much evil in the world ? What Just on a simplistic level . Why-why were there Nazis ?
MOTHER: Tell him , Max . Mickey , reacting , hits his forehead .
FATHER: How the hell do I know why there were Nazis ? I do n't know how the can opener works .

HOLLY: Boy , I knew you 'd be discouraging .

NORMA: A slight exaggeration .
EVAN: I know .
NORMA: But only slight .

LEE: No .
ELLIOT: Is something wrong ?
LEE: Oh , not here . There are too many people around .
HOLLY: Hey , Hannah ? You know , I think Lee is really serious about her new oyfriend . Yeah , eh , from what I understand he sounds really nice .
HANNAH: I 'm real upset about what you wrote .
HOLLY: My script ?
HANNAH: It 's obviously based on Elliot and me .
HOLLY: Oh , so loosely .
HANNAH: No , not `` Oh , so loosely '' ! Real specifically ! Is that how you see us ?
HOLLY: Well
HANNAH: Can I , can I not accept gestures and feelings from people ? Do I , do I put people off ?
HOLLY: Well , it 's a made-up story .
HANNAH: No , it 's real exact ! The-the situations , the dialogue , everything . It's-it 's full of intimate details etween Elliot and me ! Which I do n't , I do n't see how you could even possibly know about . A conversation we once had about adoption ?
HOLLY: Well , Lee mentioned that to me , so obviously you discussed it with her . You I just took the essence and I blew it up into drama .
HANNAH: I do n't see how Lee could know about these things . I do n't ! I do n't tell her everything .
HOLLY: Wow , I guess I hit a nerve .
HANNAH: You make it sound like , you know , I have no needs or something . You think I 'm too self-sufficient ?
HOLLY: Now , Hannah , that 's not what I meant , you know . Uh , yeah , everybody relies on you for so much . `` You 're so giving . It 's not a criticism . We love you . We 're grateful . ''
HANNAH: You 're grateful , but you resent me .
HOLLY: Oh , wow ! I do n't want to have this conversation . I did n't do anything wrong .
HANNAH: Yeah , we 're having some problems , ut problems that are my usinesswhich I do n't see how you could know about in such detail . How does Lee know about these things ? How ? They 're private !
HOLLY: Well , why do n't you share them with us ?
HANNAH: I don'tI do n't want to bothe everyone .
HOLLY: That 's the point . I 'd like to be othered .
HANNAH: I do n't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot 's een talking to you .
HOLLY: No , he has n't . If I offended you , I 'm sorry .
LEE: It 's over , Elliot . I do n't know how to make it any clearer . It 's over . I ca n't see you anymore .
ELLIOT: Uh I-I-I know . I deserve this .
LEE: Look , I 'm just as much at fault .
ELLIOT: If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you !
LEE: I 've got to be honest with you . I met someone else . I 've met someone else . II told you I was n't going to wait forever .
ELLIOT: But it has n't been forever .
LEE: It 's been nearly a year since ou first time and you 're still married to my sister , whichI now realize is fine because you 're probably much more in love with her than you know .
ELLIOT: Yeah , but we-we made so many plans .
LEE: Yeah . Uh , well , sure we did . An- an-and in a way you led me on , ecause I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah . Otherwise , I would never have let myself be drawn in . I was very weak . So were you . Now I 've met someone else .
MAVIS: About fifteen minutes .
LEE: Uh-huh . Good .
ELLIOT: And you 're in love overnight ?
LEE: I care a great deal about him , yes .
ELLIOT: Lee
LEE: Ah , it 's over ! Elliot , I mean it . It 's over !
NORMA: Sweetheart , I loved your script . I thought it was so clever .
HOLLY: Well , you 're my mother . Not everybody 's gon na be such a sucker .
NORMA: I particularly liked the characte of the mother . Just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth . Holly chuckles .
HOLLY: Oh , Mom , thanks .
UNCLE: Now here 's a toast to Thanksgiving , all right ?
HANNAH: Have you been talking to Holly o Lee about us ? About our-ou personal life ?
ELLIOT: Me ? Of course not .
HANNAH: There 's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are sopersonal they could only have come from you .
ELLIOT: Look , I 've got a splitting headache and I do n't like being accused .
HANNAH: I 'm not accusing . I 'm asking . Do youdo you find me tootoo giving ? Too-too-too competent ? Too-too , I do n't know , disgustingly perfect o something ?
ELLIOT: No .
HANNAH: Well , what is it then ? What ? Eh , what 's come between us ? How have I alienated you ?
ELLIOT: Hannah , my head is throbbing .
HANNAH: You never want to talk about it . I Every time I bring it up , you- you change the subject . What is it ? Do you We 're communicating less and less . You sleep with me less and less .
ELLIOT: Hannah , I am very mixed up ! Now please !
HANNAH: Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back ? Do you ? You must . They- they seem to know so much about us .
ELLIOT: Well , maybe I 've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke .
HANNAH: Well , what do you do ? Do-do-do you talk to Holly , or Lee , or what ? Do you , do you , do you phone them ?
ELLIOT: Leave me alone , can you ? !
HANNAH: You matter to me . Completely .
ELLIOT: It 's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return !
HANNAH: But , lookI-I have enormous needs . Elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut .
ELLIOT: Well , I ca n't see them , and neithe can Lee or Holly !
HANNAH: It 's so pitch-black tonight . I feel lost .
ELLIOT: You 're not lost .
MICKEY: Mmm , I do n't know if you remembe me , but we had the worst night of my life together .
HOLLY: I remember you .
MICKEY: Yes , you do recall , right ?
HOLLY: I recall you .
MICKEY: I was walking past and I saw you in here
HOLLY: Yeah .
MICKEY: and I thought I 'd come in andand we could replay , uh , the whole , uh
HOLLY: We did n't hit it off .
MICKEY: Oh , that 's putting it mildly . We did everything but exchange gunshots .
HOLLY: How are you ?

HOLLY: I 'm fine .
MICKEY: You look wonderful .
HOLLY: Oh , no .
MICKEY: Yeah , really . You do . You do .

HOLLY: I 'd never do that .
MICKEY: in a really horrible way .
HOLLY: Oh , well , that was a long time ago .
MICKEY: You look wonderful . You do . What happened to you ?
HOLLY: People changeyou know .
MICKEY: Well , I hope you 've changed .
HOLLY: Yeah , I hope you have , too .
MICKEY: I hope so for your sake , because , uh , your personality left something to be desired
HOLLY: Yeah , and for yours . I 'm sure you 've changed .
MICKEY: namely a personality .
HOLLY: I 'm okay .
MICKEY: You did n't answer my question . What are you doing ?
HOLLY: Oh , nothing much . You know
MICKEY: Well
HOLLY: just some stuff . A little of this , a little of that , that 's all .
MICKEY: Yeah ? Is that an embarrassing question ? Should I have not asked it ?
HOLLY: Probably not .
MICKEY: Are you , are you out of work o something ?
HOLLY: No , wellI 've been trying to write .
MICKEY: Have you ?
HOLLY: Yeah .
MICKEY: Well , that 's interesting . Wh-what kind of stuff ?
HOLLY: Ohwell , you-you 're not interested in this .
MICKEY: No , you can tell me .
HOLLY: Come on .
MICKEY: No , I am . I am .
HOLLY: Oh , no , millions of people come up to you and say , `` Hey , I have something I just wrote , '' right ?
MICKEY: Nobody ever said it .
HOLLY: Really ?
MICKEY: This is it . Yeah . This is really
HOLLY: Well , wo-would you be willing to-to ead it ? Somethingthat I wrote ?
MICKEY: Well , yes , I would if , uh , if it would mean anything to you . I do n't know why it would .
HOLLY: No , the reason I ask is
MICKEY: You 've always hated my taste in the past .
HOLLY: No , I have n't .
MICKEY: You have .
HOLLY: I have n't . No , the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great , uh , television script , and , you know , you 're so active in television , so
MICKEY: I 'm not anymore . I have n't , I have n't been in television for a year .
HOLLY: You 're kidding me .
MICKEY: I 've done no television whatsoever . No .

HOLLY: Oh , I 'm fine .
MICKEY: Whatwhat about your script ? So what 's it about ?
HOLLY: Well , I 'd love it if you 'd read it , actually , 'cause I really would value your opinion .
MICKEY: You have to remember , we-we-we did n't agree on one thing .
HOLLY: But you have to remember while you 're reading and you 're cursing my name , you know , that this is my first script . Well , it 's not my first script .
MICKEY: Hmm .
HOLLY: Actually , my first script was about Hannah and her husband , but , uh
MICKEY: Yeah .
HOLLY: Hannah read it , she got really angry , and you know , then I felt adly , so I She picks up a record .
MICKEY: Oh , well , God , I can imagine what you wrote .
HOLLY: Oh , no ! It was n't anything bad . But she just you know . I do n't know . Mickey pulls out a record and looks at it .
MICKEY: Really ?
HOLLY: So , uhI threw it out , but I have this other one . Holly looks hopefully at Mickey .
MICKEY: Well , you know , I-I-Iyou know , if you want me to , I 'll read it .

HOLLY: Hmm . I think it 's lucky I ran into you . Maybe .
MICKEY: Well , what about me ?

BARNEY: what hindered you ?
STARLING: It was n't my day .

STARLING: What have they got you doing ?
BARNEY: Orderly .

BARNEY: You said `` here 's what they want you to do '' Why ?
STARLING: Now , why n't you help us ?
BARNEY: That would adversely impact my income .
STARLING: Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property , or for failure to pay income tax , on undisclosed income .
BARNEY: We could skip the Gavotte .
STARLING: Say it in English .
BARNEY: Lechter 's not buying up his Memorabilia . He keeps it all in his `` mind , '' do you see ?

STARLING: What is that that smells so wonderful .
LECHTER: I hope you 'll find it so .
WINE: Yes . It 's good to see you regaining your strength
STARLING: Thanks to you
LECHTER: Now , what were we last speaking of ?

LECHTER: Indeed we were .
STARLING: and my need for The Institution
LECHTER: Freud , do you know ? Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon .
STARLING: And how did he do that ?
LECHTER: He saw the truth , and spoke it
STARLING: I 'm afraid , this wine is making me woozy
LECHTER: you have to eat

SWAT OFFICER: ohmiGod .
MAPP: That 's why it 's a stone , you know , It means Do n't Come Back .
STARLING: Well . No . He ca n't come back .
MAPP: Baby , that 's the beginning of wisdom .
STARLING: Give me your gun
MAPP: what ?
PENELOPE: How do you do . My name is Penelope Ryan . This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killingand those who do n't .
HAROLD: I am Harold Ryan , her husband . I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sortsas a professional soldier . I have killed thousands of other animals as wellfor sport .
WOODLY: I am Dr. Norbert Woodlya physician , a healer . I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected membe of society . Gentleness must eplace violence everywhere , or we are doomed .
PENELOPE: Would you like to say something about killing , Colonel ?
LOOSELEAF: JesusI dunno . You know . What the heck . Who knows ?
PENELOPE: Colonel Harper , retired now , dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War , killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash .
LOOSELEAF: I dunno , boy .
PENELOPE: You do n't know ?
LOOSELEAF: It was a bitch .
PENELOPE: Thank you . You can leave now . We 'll begin .
WOODLY: Peace ! All but PENELOPE exit .
PENELOPE: This is a tragedy . When it 's done , my face will be as white as the snows of Kilimanjaro . My husband , who kills so much , has een missing for eight years . He disappeared in a light plane ove the Amazon Rain Forest , where he hoped to find diamonds as big as cantaloupes . His pilot was Colonel Looseleaf Harper , who dropped the omb on Nagasaki . I should explain the doorbells in this apartment . They were built by Abercrombie and Fitch . They are actual recordings of animal cries . The back doorbell is a hyena , which you 've just heard . The front doorbell is a lion 's roar . Would you let them hear it please ? Thank you .
PAUL: He 's coming back , Mom ! He 's the avest , most wonderful man who ever lived .
PENELOPE: I told you this was a simple-minded play .
PAUL: Maybe he 'll come back tonight ! It 's his birthday .
PENELOPE: I know .
PAUL: Stay home tonight !
PENELOPE: Oh , Paul
PAUL: You 're married ! You 've already got a husband !
PENELOPE: He 's a ghost !
PAUL: He 's alive !
PENELOPE: Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore .
PAUL: If you have to go out with some guyca n't he be more like Dad ? Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly ca n't you do better than those two freaks ?
PENELOPE: Thank you , kind sir .
PAUL: A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor .
PENELOPE: A what kind of doctor ?
PAUL: A fairya queer . Everybody in the uilding knows he 's a queer .
PENELOPE: That 's an interesting piece of news .
PAUL: You 're the only woman he ever took out .
PENELOPE: Not true .
PAUL: Still lives with his mother .
PENELOPE: You know she has no feet ! You want him to abandon his mother , who has no husband , who has no money of he own , who has no feet ?
PAUL: How did she lose her feet ?
PENELOPE: In a railroad accident many years ago .
PAUL: I was afraid to ask .
PENELOPE: Norbert was just beginning practice . A real man would have sold her to a catfood company , I suppose . As fa as that goes , J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother .
PAUL: I did n't know that .
PENELOPE: A lot of people do n't .
PAUL: J. Edgar Hoover plays sports .
PENELOPE: I do n't really know .
PAUL: To only exercise Dr. Woodly eve gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign . Peace . Peace . Peace , everybody . Lion doorbell roars .
PENELOPE: I hate that thing .
PAUL: It 's beautiful .
WOODLY: Peace , everybodyPaul , Penelope .
PAUL: You 're taking Mom out tonight ?
WOODLY: You 're going out ?
PENELOPE: Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight .
WOODLY: Take plenty of cigars .
PENELOPE: We made the date three months ago .
WOODLY: I must take you to an emergency ward sometimeon a Saturday night . That 's also fun . I came to see Selma , as a matter of fact .
PENELOPE: She quit this afternoon .
PAUL: We do n't have a maid any more .
WOODLY: Oh ?
PENELOPE: The animals made her sneeze and cry too much .
WOODLY: I 'm glad somebody finally cried . Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death , I want to cry . I do n't cry , of course . Not manly , you know . Did she try antihistamines ?
PENELOPE: They made her so sleepy she could n't work .
WOODLY: Throw out all this junk . Burn it ! This room crawls with tropical disease .
PAUL: Everything stays as it is !
WOODLY: A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat .
PAUL: My father !
WOODLY: I apologize . But you did n't know him , and neither did I . How 's you asthma ?
PAUL: Do n't worry about it .
WOODLY: How 's the fungus around you thumbnail ?
PAUL: It 's fine !
WOODLY: It 's jungle rot ! This room is making everybody sick ! This is your family doctor speaking now . HereI brought you something else to hang on your wall , for the sake of variety .
PENELOPE: `` War is not healthy for children and other living things . '' How lovely .
WOODLY: No doubt Paul thinks it stinks . Lion doorbell roars .
PAUL: Keeps fairies away !
SHUTTLE: Hi kid . Would you look what the car dragged in .
WOODLY: I 'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner .
SHUTTLE: Is that a fact ?
WOODLY: That maid just quit . The place is a mess . You can start in the master bedroom .
PENELOPE: Please
SHUTTLE: He 's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom .
PENELOPE: I 'll get ready , Herb . I did n't expect you this soon . Pleasewo n't everybody be nice to everybody else while I 'm gone ?
SHUTTLE: I keep having this nightmarethat he catches us .
PENELOPE: Doing what ?
SHUTTLE: He 'd kill me . He 'd be right to kill me , toothe kind of guy he is .
PENELOPE: Or was . We have n't done anything wrong , you know .
SHUTTLE: He 'd assume we had .
PENELOPE: That 's something I suppose .
SHUTTLE: All through the day I 'm so confident . That 's why I 'm such a good salesman , you know ? I have confidence , and I look like I have confidence , and that gives othe people confidence . People laugh sometimes when they find out I 'm a vacuum cleaner salesman . They stop laughing , though , when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year . I 've got six other salesmen working under me , and what they all plug into is my confidence . That 's what charges them up .
PENELOPE: I 'm glad .
SHUTTLE: I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University .
PENELOPE: I know .
SHUTTLE: If you want to wrestle , you got Lehigh . If you want to play tennis , you go to Vanderbilt .
PENELOPE: I do n't want to go to Vanderbilt .
SHUTTLE: You do n't wrestle if you do n't have supreme confidence , and I wrestled . But when I get with you , and I say to myself , `` My Godhere I am with the wife of Harold Ryan , one of the great heroes of all time '' Pause .
PENELOPE: Yes ?
SHUTTLE: Something happens to my confidence .
PENELOPE: This conversation took place , incidentally , about three months efore Harold was declared legally dead .
SHUTTLE: When Harold is definitely out of the picture , Penelope , when I do n't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong . I 'm going to ask you to be my wife .
PENELOPE: I 'm touched .
SHUTTLE: That 's when I 'll get my confidence ack .
PENELOPE: I see .
SHUTTLE: If you 'll pardon the expression , that 's when you 'll see the fur and feathers fly . Good night .
PENELOPE: Good night . Blackout .
SHUTTLE: You 've got to fight from time to time .
WOODLY: Not true .
SHUTTLE: Or get eaten alive .
WOODLY: That 's not true eitheror need n't e , unless we make it true .
SHUTTLE: Phooey .
WOODLY: Which we do . But we can stop doing that .
SHUTTLE: Penelope ! We 're late !
PENELOPE: Coming .
SHUTTLE: Women are always late . You 'll find out .
WOODLY: The late Mrs. Harold Ryan .
SHUTTLE: I 'm sick of this argument . I just have one more thing to say If you elect a President , you support him , no matter what he does . That 's the only way you can have a country !
WOODLY: It 's the planet that 's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon .
SHUTTLE: None of my relatives are Chinese Communists . Speak for yourself .
WOODLY: Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely , moist , nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device . Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile , and that 's the end of mankind .
SHUTTLE: You can believe that if you want . I talk to guys like you , and I want to commit suicide . You get that weight-lifting set I sent you ?
PAUL: It came yesterday . I have n't opened it yet .
WOODLY: Maybe it 's supposed to end now . Maybe God would n't have it any other way .
SHUTTLE: Start with the smallest weights . Every week add a pound or two .
WOODLY: Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be rebornso he or she can see how it ends . Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are ack on Earthto see how it ends . They 're all on Times Squaremaking change for peepshows . Or recruiting Marines .
SHUTTLE: You ever hear the story about the oy who carried a calf around the arn every day ?
WOODLY: He died of a massive rupture .
SHUTTLE: You think you 're so funny . You 're not even funny . Right ? Right ? You do n't hurt yourself if you start out slow .
WOODLY: You 're preparing him for a caree in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque ? Take care of your body , yes ! But do n't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes . Do n't become obsessed by your musculature . Any one of these poor , dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be . Their magic was in their muscles . Your magic is in your brains !
PENELOPE: Gentlemen ! Is this right for a fight ? It 's been so long .
SHUTTLE: Beautiful ! I 've never seen that coat .
PENELOPE: Seven jaguars ' skins , I 'm told . Harold shot every one . Shall we go ?
WOODLY: Oh no ! Wear a coat of cottonwea a coat of wool .
PENELOPE: What ?
WOODLY: Wear a coat of domestic mink . Fo the love of God , though , Penelope , do n't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you .
SHUTTLE: She 's my date tonight . What do you want her to dobring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump ? Bugger off ! Ask Paul what he thinks . Your mother looks beautifulright ? Kid ? Does n't your mother look nice ? Paul ?
PAUL: I do n't care what she wears .
SHUTTLE: Something 's made you sore .
PAUL: Do n't worry about it .
SHUTTLE: You bet I 'll worry about it . I said something wrong ?
PAUL: It 's my father 's birthdaythat 's all . That 's all . Who cares about that ?
SHUTTLE: I had not the slightest inkling . Why did n't you say so ?
PAUL: She does n't care ! She 's not married any more ! She 's going to have fun ! I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it . Dr. WoodlyI hope you make up even etter jokes about my father than the ones you 've said so far .
SHUTTLE: Kidkid
PAUL: And I wish you 'd quit touching me all the time . It drives me nuts !
SHUTTLE: What 's this ?
PAUL: Do n't !
SHUTTLE: You sure misunderstood something and we 'd better get it straight .
PAUL: Explain it to them . I 'm bugging out of here .
SHUTTLE: Men can touch other men , and it does n't mean a thing . Have n't you ever seen football players afte they 've won the Superbowl ?
PENELOPE: Where will you be ?
PAUL: Anywhere but here . I 'd just sit here and cry about the way my father 's been forgotten .
SHUTTLE: I worship your father . That stuffed alligator your mother gave methe one he shot ? It 's the proudest thing in my apartment .
PAUL: Everybody talks about how rotten kids act . Grownups can be pretty otten , too . He exits through front door , slams it .
SHUTTLE: Kidkid
WOODLY: It 's good . Let him go .
SHUTTLE: If he 'd just come out for the Little League , the way I asked him , he 'd find out we touch all the timeshove each other , slug each other , and just horse around . I 'm going to go get him
WOODLY: Do n't ! Let him have all the privacy he wants . Let him grieve , let him rage . There has never been a funeral for his father .
PENELOPE: I never knew when to hold ito who to ask , or what to say .
WOODLY: Tonight 's the night .
SHUTTLE: If he 'd just get into scouting , and camp out some , and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire
WOODLY: What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage .
SHUTTLE: I feel like I 've been double- crossed . If you 'd just told me it was Harold 's birthday
PENELOPE: What then ?
SHUTTLE: We could have had some kind of irthday party for him . We could have taken Paul to the fight with us .
WOODLY: Minors are n't allowed at fights .
SHUTTLE: Then we 'd stay home and eat venison or something , and look through the scrapbooks . I 've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped ass and caribou meat . I 'm going to bring that boy back . He exits through front door .
WOODLY: This is very good for us .
PENELOPE: It is ?
WOODLY: The wilder Paul is tonight , the calmer he 'll be tomorrow .
PENELOPE: As long as he keeps out of the park .
WOODLY: After this explosion , I think , he 'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again .
PENELOPE: The only thing I ever told him about life was , `` Keep out of the park after the sun goes down . ''
WOODLY: We 've got to dump Shuttle . He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates ?
PENELOPE: That 's the XKE .
WOODLY: The what ?
PENELOPE: It 's an experimental model . He does n't dare leave it in his car , for fear it will fall into the hands of competition .
WOODLY: What kind of a life is that ?
PENELOPE: He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was . He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old . Oh , Norbertpromise me that Paul has not gone into the park !
WOODLY: If you warned him against it as much as you say , it 's almost a certainty .
PENELOPE: No ! Oh no ! Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks ! The police wo n't even go in there any more .
WOODLY: I wish Paul luck .
PENELOPE: It 's suicide !
WOODLY: I 'd be dead by now if that were the case .
PENELOPE: Meaning ?
WOODLY: Every night , Penelope , for the past two years , I 've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight .
PENELOPE: Why would you do that ?
WOODLY: To show myself how brave I am . The issue 's in doubt , you knowsince I 'm always for peace
PENELOPE: I 'm amazed .
WOODLY: Me , too . I know something not even the police knowwhat 's in the park at midnight . Nothing . Or , when I 'm in there , there 's me in there . Fear and nobody and me .
PENELOPE: And maybe Paul . What about the murderers ? They 're in there !
WOODLY: They did n't murder me .
PENELOPE: Paul 's only twelve years old .
WOODLY: He can make the sound of human footstepswhich is a terrifying sound .
PENELOPE: We 've got to rescue him .
WOODLY: If he is in the park , luck is all that can save him now , and there 's plenty of that .
PENELOPE: He 's not your son .
WOODLY: No . But he 's going to be . If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side , I can say to him , `` You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight . '' On that we can build .
PENELOPE: It 's a jungle out there .
WOODLY: That 's been said before .
PENELOPE: He 'd go to a movie . I think that 's what he 'd do . If I were sure he was in a movie , I could stop worrying . We could have him paged . Lion doorbell roars .
WOODLY: I hate that thing .
PENELOPE: Did you see him ?
SHUTTLE: Yeah .
PENELOPE: Is he all right ?
SHUTTLE: Far as I know .
PENELOPE: Is he coming home ?
SHUTTLE: He ditched me . He started running , and I started running , then he lost me in the park .
PENELOPE: The park !
SHUTTLE: It 's dark in there .
PENELOPE: And that 's where he is !
SHUTTLE: I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another .
PENELOPE: You figure !
SHUTTLE: Then I saw this bakery store that was still open , so I bought a irthday cake .
PENELOPE: A what ?
SHUTTLE: For Harold . When Paul comes home , we can have some birthday cake .
PENELOPE: How nice .
SHUTTLE: They had this cake somebody else had n't picked up . It says , `` Happy Birthday , Somebody Else . ''
WOODLY: `` Happy Birthday , Wanda June ! ''
SHUTTLE: We can take off the `` Wanda June '' with a butter knife .
PENELOPE: Did you talk to Paul ?
SHUTTLE: Before he started to run . He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neckand someday we 'd all hear the sound of that key in the door .
PENELOPE: We 've got to find him . I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last . And you stay here , Norbert , in case he comes home . That 's all he saidthe thing about the key ?
SHUTTLE: He said one other thing . It was n't very nice .
PENELOPE: What was it ?
SHUTTLE: He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon . Blackout .
WOODLY: Ooops .
HAROLD: Ooops .
WOODLY: Can Iuhhelp you gentlemen ?
HAROLD: Gentlementhat 's nice .
WOODLY: You startled me .
LOOSELEAF: Yeah . We just got here .
WOODLY: I thought you might be burglars ut you 're not , I hope .
LOOSELEAF: Nope . I got a lot of stuff .
WOODLY: You do ?
HAROLD: The door ws unlocked . Is it always unlocked ?
WOODLY: It 's always locked .
HAROLD: But here you are inside , are n't you ?
WOODLY: You'reyou 're old friends of Harold Ryan ?
HAROLD: We tried to be . We tried to be .
WOODLY: He 's dead , you know .
HAROLD: Dead ! Such a final word . Dead ! Did you hear that ?
LOOSELEAF: Yup .
WOODLY: Hello ? Ohhello , Mother .
HAROLD: Hello , Mother .
WOODLY: Who ? Did she say how fa apart the pains were ? When was that ? Oh dear .
HAROLD: Oh dear .
WOODLY: Call her backtell her to head fo the hospital . Tell the hospital to expect her . I 'll leave right now . He hangs up , faces the intruders .
HAROLD: We 'll miss you so .
WOODLY: Lookthis is n't my apartment , and there is n't anybody else here . Mrs. Ryan wo n't be home for a while .
HAROLD: Oh , oh , ohI thought it was you apartment . You seemed at home here .
WOODLY: I 'm a neighbor . I have the apartment across the hall . I have to go to the hospital now . An emergency . HAROLD is unstirred .
HAROLD: Ahhthen she 's still alive .
WOODLY: She 's fine . Please
HAROLD: And still Mrs. Harold Ryan ?
WOODLY: Will you please go ? An emergency !
HAROLD: She still has just the one child the boy ?
WOODLY: Yes ! Yes ! The boy ! One boy !
HAROLD: And what , exactly , is you elationship to Mrs. Ryan ?
WOODLY: Neighbor ! Doctor ! I live across the hall .
HAROLD: And you come into Mrs. Ryan 's apartment as often as you please , looking into various health matters ?
WOODLY: Yes ! Please ! You 've got to get out right now ! HAROLD moves a little more , stops again .
HAROLD: Just her neighbor and doctor ? That 's all ?
WOODLY: And her fiancé !
HAROLD: And her fiancé ! How nice . I hope you 'll be very happyor is that what one says to the woman ?
WOODLY: I 've got to run ! He turns out the overhead light .
HAROLD: You wish the woman good luck , and you tell the man how fortunate he is . That 's how it goes .
WOODLY: I 've literally got to run !
HAROLD: I wo n't try to keep up with you . I 'm not as fast on my feet as I once was .
LOOSELEAF: I dunno , boy .
HAROLD: Hm ?
LOOSELEAF: It 's a bitch .
HAROLD: A bitch .
LOOSELEAF: Did n't recognize you .
HAROLD: We 've never met .
LOOSELEAF: I wonder who 'll recognize us first ? They 'll wet their pants .
HAROLD: I hope the men do . I would rathe the women did n't .
LOOSELEAF: I 'm gon na wet my pants . He laughs idiotically .
HAROLD: Home , sweet home .
LOOSELEAF: One thing , anywayat least Penelope did n't throw out all you crap . I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I 'd been gone a week .
HAROLD: We 'll see .
LOOSELEAF: Home . Jesus . I 'm like this . Home !
HAROLD: Home is important to a man .
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me ?
HAROLD: No .
LOOSELEAF: How all the magazines show tits today .
HAROLD: Um .
LOOSELEAF: Used to be against the law , did n't it ?
HAROLD: I suppose .
LOOSELEAF: Must have changed that law .
HAROLD: Home .
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me ? HAROLD does not respond .
HAROLD: Oh , shit .
LOOSELEAF: How everybody says `` fuck '' and `` shit '' all the time . I used to be scared shitless I 'd say `` fuck '' o `` shit '' in public , by accident . Now everybody says `` fuck '' and `` shit , '' `` fuck '' and `` shit '' all the time . Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country .
HAROLD: Looseleafwill you get the hell home ?
LOOSELEAF: At least we found the diamonds .
HAROLD: At least !
LOOSELEAF: I 'd really feel stupid if we did n't ing anything back home .
HAROLD: It 's enough that you 've brought yourself home !
LOOSELEAF: I wish you 'd tell Alice that . And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler .
HAROLD: Tell them yourself !
LOOSELEAF: You do n't know my mother-in-law , boy .
HAROLD: After eight years in the jungle with you , I know Mrs. Wheele etter than I know anybody in the universe !
LOOSELEAF: I did n't tell you everything .
HAROLD: The time we were in a tree fo fourteen days , you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler .
LOOSELEAF: I did n't even scratch the surface . You 're lucky , boy . You come home , and nobody 's here . When I go home , everybody 's going to be there .
HAROLD: This room is full of ghosts .
LOOSELEAF: You 're lucky , boy . My house is gon na be filled with people .
HAROLD: Go home !
LOOSELEAF: Thank God we found the fucking diamonds !
HAROLD: The hell with the diamonds !
LOOSELEAF: You were rich before . This is the first time I was ever rich .
HAROLD: Go home ! Show them how rich you are for a change !
LOOSELEAF: Can I have the Cadillac ?
HAROLD: Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff , for all I care .
LOOSELEAF: What 'll you do for transportation ?
HAROLD: I 'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs . Go home !
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me about that Cadillac ?
HAROLD: Go home !
LOOSELEAF: When I drive it , I feel like I 'm in the middle of a great big wad of ubblegum . I do n't hear anything , I do n't feel anything . I figure somebody else is driving . It 's a itch .
HAROLD: Go home .
LOOSELEAF: I 'm liable to find anything !
HAROLD: That 's the point ! Walk in there and find whatever there is to findbefore Alice can cover it up .
LOOSELEAF: I know , I know . I dunno . At least she 's in the same house . Sure was spooky , looking in the window there , and there she was .
HAROLD: So long , Colonel .
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me ?
HAROLD: Let 's talk about it some other time .
LOOSELEAF: How short the skirts are .
HAROLD: Good night , Colonel . It 's been eautiful .
LOOSELEAF: Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone .
HAROLD: Hell ! HAROLD opens the door . LOOSELEAF comes in .
LOOSELEAF: You know what gets me ? Those guys who went to the moon ! To the moon , oy !
HAROLD: Leave me alone ! After eight years of horrendously close association , the time has come to part ! I crave solitude and time for reflection and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood . You and I may not meet again for months !
LOOSELEAF: Months ?
HAROLD: I 'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow , and I will not welcome your horning back into mine . A chapter has ended . We are old comradesat a parting of the ways .
LOOSELEAF: I 'm lonesome already . He exits .
HAROLD: The moon . The new heroismput a village idiot into a pressure cooker , seal it up tight , and shoot him at the moon . Hello there , young man . In case you 're wondering , I could beat the shit out of you . And any woman choosing between ussorry , kid , she 'd choose me . I must say , this room is very much as I left it . What 's this ? A cake ? `` Happy Birthday , Wanda June '' ? Who the hell is Wanda June ? Blackout .
WANDA JUNE: Hello . I am Wanda June . Today was going to be my birthday , but I was hit by an ice-cream truck before I could have my party . I am dead now . I am in Heaven . That is why my parents did not pick up the cake at the bakery . I am not mad at the ice-cream truck driver , even though he was drunk when he hit me . It did n't hurt much . It was n't even as bad as the sting of a bumblebee . I am really happy here ! It 's so much fun . I am glad the driver was drunk . If he had n't been , I might not have got to Heaven for years and years and years . I would have had to go to high school first , and then eauty college . I would have had to get married and have babies and everything . Now I can just play and play and play . Any time I want any pink cotton candy I can have some . Everybody up here is happy the animals and the dead soldiers and people who went to the electric chair and everything . They 're all glad for whatever sent them here . Nobody is mad . We 're all too busy playing shuffleboard . So if you think of killing somebody , do n't worry about it . Just go ahead and do it . Whoever you do it to should kiss you for doing it . The soldiers up here just love the shrapnel and the tanks and the ayonets and the dum dums that let them play shuffleboard all the timeand drink beer .
LOOSELEAF: When Penelope asked me to say something about dropping the bom on Nagasaki , I did n't give a very good answer , I guess . It 's a very complicated question . Jesusyou know ? You have to explain what it 's like to be in the Air Force and how they give you your orders and all that . What it feels like to be in a plane , what the world looks like down there . After I got home from the war , the minister of my church asked me if I would speak to a scout troop that met in the church basement . So I did . They met on Thursday nights . I used to elong to that troop . I never made Eagle Scout . But you know something ? It 's a very strange kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout . They always seem so lonesome , like they 'd worked real hard to get a job nobody else cares about . They get a whole bunch of merit badges . That 's how you get to be an Eagle Scout . I do n't think I had ove five or six merit badges . The only one I remember is Public Health . That was a bitch . The Boy Scout Manual said I was supposed to find out what my town did about sewage . Jesus , they just dumped it all in Sugar Creek . Sugar Creek ! That was a long time ago , but it 's all coming back to me now . There was another merit badge you could get for roller skating . There used to be a roller rink at a end in Sugar Creek , up above where the sewage went in . I got in a fight there one time . I had on oller skates , and the guy I was fighting had on basketball shoes . He had a tremendous advantage ove me . He was a little guy , but he eat the shit out of me . I had to laugh like hell . Do n't ever fight a guy when you 've got on rolle skates . JesusI remember my mother used to make me chew bananas for a full minute before I swallowedso I would n't get sick . Makes you wonder what else your parents told you that was n't true . Blackout .
HAROLD: The night I met Penelope , I had no eardso imagine me , if you can , without a beard . Actually , I was n't as good-looking then as I am now . And , if anything , me health has improved . At any rateI had just come home from Kenyato discover that my third wife , Mildred , like the two before her , had become a drunken bum . In my experience , alcoholism is far more prevalent among women than men . So I got into my automobile
PENELOPE: Heaven .
HAROLD: I think so , daughter . How old are you ?
PENELOPE: Eighteen and a half .
HAROLD: A springbok , an oryx , a gemsboka gazelle .
PENELOPE: Sir ?
HAROLD: Raw hamburger , pleaseand a whole onion . I want to eat the onion like an apple . Do you understand ?
PENELOPE: Yes , sir . It was a very unusual automobile . It was a Cadillac , but it had wate uffalo horns where the bumpers should be . And what to drink ?
HAROLD: What time do you get off work , my child ?
PENELOPE: I 'm sorry , sir , I 'm engaged to be married . My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man .
HAROLD: Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire ?
PENELOPE: I 'm engaged .
HAROLD: DaughterI love you very much .
PENELOPE: You do n't even know me .
HAROLD: You are woman . I know woman well .
PENELOPE: This is crazy .
HAROLD: Destiny often seems that way . You 're going to marry me .
PENELOPE: What do you do for a living ?
HAROLD: My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old . They left me a brewery and a aseball teamand other things . I live for a living . I 've just come ack from Kenyain Africa . I 've een hunting Mau Mau there .
PENELOPE: Some kind of animal ?
HAROLD: The pelt is black . It 's a kind of man . Blackout .
PAUL: Mom ? Herb ? Dr. Woodly ? Hello ? A cake ? Who 's Wanda June ?
HAROLD: As a matter of fact
PAUL: Sir ?
HAROLD: As a matter of factI am home .
PAUL: Hello .
HAROLD: Hello .
PAUL: Are you His voice fails him .
HAROLD: You were about to ask a question ?
PAUL: Are youdo you
HAROLD: Ask it !
PAUL: Do you know who Wanda June is ?
HAROLD: Life has denied me that thrill .
PAUL: Do you mind if I ask who you are ?
HAROLD: Mind ? God , yes , I mind . I 'm your father 's friend . A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago .
PAUL: Dr. Woodly .
HAROLD: Dr. Woodly . I should make a little list .
PAUL: Is anybody besides you here now ?
HAROLD: The doctor was called away on an emergency . I think it was birth .
PAUL: Where 's Mom ?
HAROLD: You do n't know where your mother is ? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night ?
PAUL: She went to the fight with He Shuttle , I guess .
HAROLD: You think you could find me a pencil and paper ?
PAUL: I 'll see . He rummages through a drawer .
HAROLD: And you 've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where ?
PAUL: I was going to a funny movie , but I changed my mind . If you 're depressed , laughing does n't help much . When did you know my father ?
HAROLD: Man and boy .
PAUL: Everybody says he was so brave .
HAROLD: Even this '' Herb Shuttle '' , you said ?
PAUL: He worships Father .
HAROLD: Ah ! And what sort of man is this worshiper ?
PAUL: He 's a vacuum cleaner salesman .
HAROLD: I see . And he came into the apartment one day , to demonstrate his wares , and your mother , as it happened , was charmingly en deshabille
PAUL: She met him at college .
HAROLD: College !
PAUL: They were in the same creative writing class .
HAROLD: College ?
PAUL: She has a master 's degree in English literature .
HAROLD: What a pity ! Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch . Everything stops . And the doctor ? He worships you father , too ?
PAUL: He insults him all the time .
HAROLD: Excellent !
PAUL: What 's good about that ?
HAROLD: It makes life spicy .
PAUL: He does n't do it in front of me , ut he does it with Mother . You know what he called Father one time ?
HAROLD: No .
PAUL: `` Harold , the Patron Saint of Taxidermy . ''
HAROLD: What does he doof an athletic nature ?
PAUL: Nothing . He plays a violin in a doctors ' quartet .
HAROLD: Aha ! He has a brilliant military ecord , I 'm sure .
PAUL: He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War . Were you in a war with Father ?
HAROLD: Big ones , little ones , teeny-weeny onesjust and otherwise .
PAUL: Tell me some true stories about Dad .
HAROLD: `` Dad ? '' Dad . The boy wants tales of derring-do . Name a country .
PAUL: England ?
HAROLD: Oh hell .
PAUL: Dad was never in England ?
HAROLD: Behind a desk for a little while . A desk ! They had him planning ai aids . A city ca n't flee like a coward or fight like a man , and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan . There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice , and that was making the choice himself . Ask about Spain , where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade . He was a famous sniper . They called him `` La Picadura '' '' the sting . ''
PAUL: `` The sting . ''
HAROLD: As in `` Death , where is thy sting ? '' He killed at least fifty men , wounded hundreds more .
PAUL: `` The sting . ''
HAROLD: Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla bandin the wa against the Nazis .
PAUL: Tell me that .
HAROLD: I saw your father fight Majo Siegfried von Konigswald , the Beast of Yugoslavia , hand to hand .
PAUL: Tell me that ! Tell me that !
HAROLD: Hid by dayfought by night . At sunset one day , your father and I , peering through field glasses , saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn . It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car . Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of historythe Beast of Yugoslavia .
PAUL: Wow .
HAROLD: We blacked our hands and faces . At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village . The name of the village was Mhravitch . Remember that name !
PAUL: Mhravitch .
HAROLD: We came up behind a sentry , and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound .
PAUL: Uck .
HAROLD: Do n't care for cold steel ? A knife is worse than a bullet ?
PAUL: I do n't know .
HAROLD: The story gets hairier . Should I stop ?
PAUL: Go on .
HAROLD: We caught another Kraut alone in a ack lane . Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire . Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire . That 's nicer than a knife , is n't itas long as you do n't look at the face afterwards . The face turns a curious shade of avocado . I must ask the doctor why that is . At any ate , we stole into the back of the inn , and , with the permission of the management , we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there .
PAUL: Where did you get the poison ?
HAROLD: We carried cyanide capsules . We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured . It was you father 's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time .
PAUL: And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia ?
HAROLD: The Beast was upstairs , and he came unning downstairs , for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testamentseditorializing about the hospitality they had eceived . And your father said to him in perfect German , which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War , `` Major , something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard . I am Harold Ryan , of the United States of America . You , I believe , are the Beast of Yugoslavia . '' Blackout .
VON KONIGSWALD: Ja ja . Ja ja . I am Major Siegfried von Konigswald . They used to call me `` The Beast of Yugoslavia , '' on account of all the people I had tortured and shotand hanged . We 'd bop 'em on the head . We 'd hook 'em up to the electricity . We 'd stick 'em with hypodermic syringes full of all kinds of stuff . One time we killed a guy with orange juice . There was a train wreck , and two of the freight cars were loaded with oranges , so we had oceans of orange juice . It was a jokehow much orange juice we had . And we were interrogating a guy one day , and he would n't talk , and the next thing I knowsomebody 's filling up this big syringe with orange juice . There was a guerrilla war going on . You could n't tell who was a guerrilla and who was n't . Even if you got one , it was still a civilian you got . Telling Americans what a guerrilla war is likethat 's coals to Newcastle . How do you like that for idiomatic English ? `` Coals to Newcastle . '' That Harold Ryanhe says he spoke to me in perfect German ? He talks German like my ass chews gum . I 'm glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me . I sure did n't understand it the first time around . I figured he was a Lithuanian or something , which will give you an idea of how wrong you can be . All I knew was he was very proud about something , and he had a machine pistol , and it was aimed at me . The woods were full of all kinds of nuts who were proud of some damn thing or other , and they all had guns . They were always looking for revenge . You find a way to bottle revengethat 's the end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola . Harold Ryan said he killed maybe two hundred guys . I killed a hundred times that many , I bet . That 's still peanuts , of course , compared to what that crazy Looseleaf did . Harold and mewe was doing it the hard way . I hope the record books will show that . There should be a little star o something by the names of the guys who did it the hard way . I 'm up in Heaven now , like that little Wanda June kid . I was n't hit by no ice-cream truck . Harold Ryan killed me with his bare hands . He was good . My eyes popped out . My tongue stuck out like a red anana . I shit in my pants . It was a mess . When I got up on the day I died , I said , `` What a beautiful day this is . What a beautiful part of the world . '' The whole planet was eautiful . Up here I meet guys from other planets . We got some really crazy-looking guys up here . Their planets were n't anywhere near as nice as Earth . They had clouds all the time . They never saw a clear blue sky . They never saw snow . They never saw an ocean . They had some little lakes , but you could n't go swimming in them . The lakes were acid . You go swimming , you dissolve . We got some guys up here who got shoved in them lakes . They dissolved . Harold Ryan stopped talking German to me there in Yugoslavia . He switched to English , so I finally got some kind of idea what he was so burned up about . He wanted evenge for the guy we killed with orange juice . I do n't know how he ever found out about it . There was just three of us there when we did itme and two regular military doctors . Somebody who cleaned up afterwards must have squealed . If I 'd lived through the war , and they tried me for war crimes and all that , I 'd have to tell the court , I guess , `` I was only following orders , as a good soldier should . Hitler told me to kill this guy with orange juice . '' Blackout .
HAROLD: Mhravitch . Remember that name .
PAUL: Mhravitch .
HAROLD: The name will live forever . It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia . Mhravitch .
PAUL: When I grow up , I 'm going to go to Mhravitch .
HAROLD: It 's rather a disappointment these days . It is n't there any more .
PAUL: Sir ?
HAROLD: The Germans shot everybody who lived there , then leveled it , plowed it , planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground . They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia . To their twisted way of thinking , you father had butchered an Eagle Scout . Play lots of contact sports ?
PAUL: I wanted to go out for football , ut Mom was afraid I 'd get hurt .
HAROLD: You 're supposed to get hurt !
PAUL: Dr. Woodly says he 's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football . He says that when there 's a war , everybody goes but football players .
HAROLD: Does it bother you to have you mother engaged to a man like that ?
PAUL: They 're not engaged .
HAROLD: He seems to think they are . He told me that were .
PAUL: Oh no , no , no , no , no . It ca n't be . How embarrassing .
HAROLD: You 're a very good boy to respond that way .
PAUL: No , no , no , no , no .
HAROLD: I 'd like to use the sanitary facilities , if I may .
PAUL: Go ahead . No , no , no , no .
SHUTTLE: What a relief !
PENELOPE: My baby 's safe ! PAUL angrily avoids her touch .
SHUTTLE: We got a birthday cake , kid . Did you see the cake ?
PAUL: Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged ?
PENELOPE: Who have you been talking to ?
PAUL: What difference does that make ? Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now ? Pause .
PENELOPE: Yes , he is .
PAUL: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah !
SHUTTLE: That goes double for me .
PAUL: I do n't want to live any more .
SHUTTLE: I feel like I want to yell my head offjust yell anything . Bulllllllllllllll-dickey !
PAUL: I 'll kill myself .
SHUTTLE: The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next ? This is the end of Western Civilization as fa as I 'm concerned . You must be crazy as a fruitcake .
PENELOPE: Possibly .
SHUTTLE: How long has this been going on ?
PENELOPE: A week . We were waiting for the ight time to
SHUTTLE: I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of .
PENELOPE: I 'm sorry .
SHUTTLE: Marry me instead .
PENELOPE: Thank you , Herb . You 're a wonderful man . You really are . Everybody respects you for what you 've done for scouting and the Little League .
SHUTTLE: You 're saying no .
PENELOPE: I 'm saying noand thank you .
SHUTTLE: I did n't make my move fast enough . That 's it , is n't it ? I was too espectful .
PENELOPE: You were wonderful .
SHUTTLE: What 's so wonderful if I lost the sale ? You poor kid .
PAUL: Do n't touch me .
SHUTTLE: Would n't you rather have you mother marry me than him ?
PAUL: No .
SHUTTLE: All my dreams have suddenly collapsed . We did have a lot of laughs together , Penelope .
PENELOPE: It 's true .
SHUTTLE: Wellit was nice while it lasted . Thanks for the memories . He exits .
PENELOPE: Is Norbert still here ?
PAUL: No .
PENELOPE: Then who flushed the toilet ?
PAUL: Father 's friend .
PENELOPE: What 's his name ?
PAUL: Do n't know .
PENELOPE: For Heaven 's sakes ! HAROLD enters , still adjusting his trousers .
HAROLD: How do you do , Mrs. Ryan ? I 'd heard you were beautiful , and so you are . Am I intruding here ?
PENELOPE: Not at all .
HAROLD: I could n't help overhearing that you were about to get married again .
PENELOPE: Our family physician has asked me to marry him . Paul needs the guidance and companionship that only a man can give . He is n't at all like Harold . But then again , I 'm not the woman I was eight years ago .
PAUL: Mom ?
PENELOPE: That man is your father .
PAUL: What ?
PENELOPE: There stands the loins from which you 've sprung .
PAUL: I do n't get it .
PENELOPE: It is you , is n't it , Harold ?
HAROLD: Yes , wife , it is . Come here , boy . Your father is home .
PAUL: Sir ?
PENELOPE: Go to him .
HAROLD: Wife , wife , wife
PENELOPE: Give us time .
HAROLD: Like hugging a lamp post .
PENELOPE: Give us time , Haroldto adjust to your being alive .
HAROLD: You were well adjusted to my being dead ?
PENELOPE: We adjust to what there is to adjust to . Perhaps Paul , being young , can adjust to joy or grief immediately . I hope he can . I will take a little longer . I 'll be as quick as I can .
HAROLD: What sort of time period do you have in mind ? Half an hour ? An hour ?
PENELOPE: I do n't know . This is a new disease to me .
HAROLD: Disease ?
PENELOPE: Situation .
HAROLD: This reunion is n't what I imagined it would be .
PENELOPE: A telegrama phone call might have helped .
HAROLD: Seemed the most honest way to begin life together againnatural , unrehearsed .
PENELOPE: Wellenjoy the natural , honest , unrehearsed resultsurgical shock .
HAROLD: You feel that you 're behaving as a woman should ?
PENELOPE: Every fuse in my nervous system has een blown . Lion doorbell roars .
WOODLY: Safe and sound , I see . Ohyou came back .
HAROLD: I came back .
PENELOPE: You know each other ?
WOODLY: We met here earlier this evening .
PENELOPE: How neat . How keen .
HAROLD: How was the emergency , Doctor ? Profitable , I hope .
WOODLY: A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab .
HAROLD: Tough luck . You 'll have to split the fee .
WOODLY: Areare you crying , Penelope ?
HAROLD: She 's crying because she 's so happy .
PENELOPE: That 's why I 'm crying .
PAUL: Dr. Woodly ? You know who this is ?
WOODLY: I did n't get his name . A friend of your father ?
PAUL: He is n't any friend of Father .
WOODLY: He is n't ?
PAUL: He is my father .
WOODLY: No !
PENELOPE: Eeeeeeeeeeee-yup . Dr. WoodlyI would like you to meet Harold , my husband . Harold , this is Dr. Woodly , my fiancé .
WOODLY: I feel the same way . What next ?
HAROLD: What next ? You leave promptly , of course . There is no question as to whose home this is
WOODLY: None .
HAROLD: Whose son this is , whose wife that is . A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time . Good night .
WOODLY: Good night .
HAROLD: Penelope ! God damn it ! Penelope !
PAUL: Is Looseleaf Harper alive ?
HAROLD: Alive and hale . He 's throwing a little surprise party for his own family . Is your mother often this unstable ? Penelope !
PAUL: She 's a real heavy sleeper sometimes .
HAROLD: Why do n't you go to bedson .
PAUL: I ca n't take my eyes off you .
HAROLD: Tomorrow 's another day .
PAUL: You know what my English literature teacher said about you ?
HAROLD: Ca n't it keep till morning ?
PAUL: She said you were legendary . I wrote a theme about you , and she said , `` Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes . ''
HAROLD: That 's nice . You thank her for me . Go to bed and get lots of sleep , and then you thank her in the morning .
PAUL: Tomorrow 's Saturday . Anyway , she 's dead .
HAROLD: Penelope !
PAUL: She was killed in the park two months agoin the daytime .
HAROLD: Penelope !
PAUL: She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society , and they got her .
HAROLD: Will you go to bed ?
PAUL: Yes sir . If you ca n't wake Mom up , I 've got double-decker bunks .
HAROLD: Scat !
PENELOPE: There is no one in here of any earthly use to anyone tonight . Tomorrow is another day . She closes the door and locks it .
HAROLD: End of Act One . Blackout .
PAUL: Mom ! Mother ! Mom !
HAROLD: Damn .
PAUL: Mom ?
PENELOPE: What are his symptoms ?
PAUL: Shivers and sweats and groans . His teeth chatter . What 'll we do ?
PENELOPE: What does he say to do ?
PAUL: He can hardly talk .
HAROLD: Bluh .
PENELOPE: You 'd better get Dr. Woodly .
PAUL: Really ?
PENELOPE: It is an emergency , is n't it ?
PAUL: Yeah .
PENELOPE: Then get him .
PAUL: Okay .
HAROLD: What 's that all about ?
PENELOPE: We thought a doctor might help .
HAROLD: Your old beau ?
PENELOPE: We thought it was an emergency .
HAROLD: I do n't want that chancre mechanic in here .
PENELOPE: He 's a very decent man , Harold .
HAROLD: We all are .
PENELOPE: Should n't you lie down ?
HAROLD: When I 'm dead or fucking .
PENELOPE: Paul said you were awfully sick .
HAROLD: I was , I was . It never lasts long .
WOODLY: Ah ! You 're ambulatory !
HAROLD: What a brilliant diagnosis !
PENELOPE: You know what I want ? I want you both to be friends . I know you both , respect you both . You should be friends .
HAROLD: Nothing would please me more .
PENELOPE: Thank God !
WOODLY: Well nowwhat seems to be the trouble with the patient today ? A touch of malaria , perhaps ?
HAROLD: I know malaria . Malaria is n't caused by the bites of bats .
WOODLY: You 've been bitten by bats ?
HAROLD: Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats . There was a flash flood . There were piranha fish in the water . That 's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe .
WOODLY: You have chills ?
HAROLD: Chills , fevers , sweats . You can describe it and name it afte yourself `` the Woodly galloping crud . ''
WOODLY: I was going to ask .
HAROLD: Pacqualinincheewa root .
WOODLY: Would you say that again ?
HAROLD: Pacqualinincheewa root . Means `` cougar fang . '' Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back .
WOODLY: I 've never heard of it .
HAROLD: Congratulations . By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet , you 've become the third white man ever to hear of it .
WOODLY: Are you 've seen it work cures ?
HAROLD: Hundreds .
PENELOPE: I 'm so glad you like each other . I was so scared , so scared .
HAROLD: Have some .
WOODLY: Thank you . Thank you very much .
PENELOPE: I believe in miracles now .
HAROLD: Was n't that sweet of me ?
WOODLY: More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people . Curare , ephedrinewe 've found some amazing things .
HAROLD: We have , have we ?
WOODLY: That 's an editorial we , of course . I have n't turned up anything personally .
HAROLD: Everything about you is the editorial we . Take that away from you , and you 'd disappear .
PENELOPE: Harold !
HAROLD: I could carve a better man out of a anana !
PENELOPE: Please
HAROLD: You and your damned bedside manne and your damned little black bag full of miracles . You know who filled that bag for you ? Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself . Men with guts filled it , y Godmen with guts enough to pay the price for miraclessuffering , ingratitude , loneliness , death
WOODLY: Good Lord .
HAROLD: I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa oot . I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now `` We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest . Now we cure you with it . Now we lower ou eyes with becoming modesty as we eceive heartfelt thanks . ''
PENELOPE: He does n't deserve this ! You do n't know him . It is n't fair !
HAROLD: He thought he could take my place . It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I do n't think he 's man enough to do that .
WOODLY: I thought she was a widow .
HAROLD: You were wrong , you quack !
PENELOPE: Awful . I ca n't tell you how sorry I am .
HAROLD: Say hello to your mother .
PENELOPE: Do say hello to your mother .
WOODLY: I 'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now . She 's going to East St. Louisto visit an aunt .
PENELOPE: Tell her to have a nice trip .
WOODLY: Thanks .
HAROLD: What for ?
WOODLY: Quarantine , possibly . You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without . Goodbye . He exits instantly .
HAROLD: Now that 's what I call fun .
PENELOPE: Ghastly , cruel , unnecessary .
HAROLD: You 'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again . You used to eat it up .
PENELOPE: I did ?
HAROLD: We were one hell of a pairand we 'll be one again . What we need is a honeymoon . Let 's start right now .
PENELOPE: A trip , you mean ?
HAROLD: I had a trip . We 'll honeymoon here . Go out and play .
PAUL: Play ?
HAROLD: Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours .
PENELOPE: He has n't had breakfast yet .
HAROLD: Buy yourself breakfast . There we go .
PAUL: A hundred dollars !
HAROLD: The smallest thing I 've got .
PAUL: Can I get dressed first ?
HAROLD: Make it fast .
PENELOPE: It 's soso stark .
HAROLD: You used to like it stark !
PENELOPE: Justbangwe have a honeymoon .
HAROLD: I 'm not going to strike you . I am going to be as gentle as pieas lemon meringue pie . You must n't un away now . This is your loving husband approaching . I 'm you husband . Society approves ! PENELOPE wants to run , but does n't .
PENELOPE: Turn around ?
HAROLD: I 'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty . What I have in mind is massagea perfectly decent massage . Turn around , turn around . PENELOPE obeys .
PENELOPE: You should n't have talked to Norbert that way .
HAROLD: You 're thinking with your brain instead of your body . That 's why you 're so tense ! Forget Norbert . Relax . It 's body time .
PENELOPE: I have a brain .
HAROLD: We all do . But now it 's body time . Relax . Ideally , the body of a woman should feel like a hot wate ottle filled with Devonshire cream . You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods . Think of you muscles one by one . Let them go slack . Relax . Let the brain go lank . Relax . That 's the idea that 's my girl . Now the small of the back . Let those knots ove those kidneys unsnarl .
PAUL: Dad
HAROLD: Could n't you have vanished quietly out the back door ?
PAUL: A hundred dollars for breakfast ?
HAROLD: Leave a tip .
PENELOPE: I have some change !
HAROLD: Ram it up your ass !
LOOSELEAF: I 've been looking at motorcycles .
HAROLD: Go home !
LOOSELEAF: You ever own a motorcycle ?
HAROLD: You 're right ! We 'll take a trip . A trip is what we 'll take . I do n't want to talk about motorcycles . I do n't want to talk about tits . Go home !
LOOSELEAF: Have n't got one .
PENELOPE: And you went home unannounced , too ?
LOOSELEAF: I dunno . Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! I did .
HAROLD: And how were things ?
LOOSELEAF: Let 's talk about something else .
PENELOPE: Alice got married again .
LOOSELEAF: She did ?
PENELOPE: You did n't even find that out ?
LOOSELEAF: There was so much going on .
PENELOPE: She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum .
LOOSELEAF: So that 's it ! `` Kestenbaum , Kestenbaum . '' Everybody was yelling `` Kestenbaum , Kestenbaum . '' I thought it was some foreign language .
HAROLD: Otherwise , how are things ?
LOOSELEAF: I sure did n't expect her to drop dead .
PENELOPE: Dead !
LOOSELEAF: Jesus .
PENELOPE: Alice is dead ?
LOOSELEAF: No , noshit no . Excuse me , Penelope .
PENELOPE: For what ?
LOOSELEAF: For saying `` shit . '' Or is that okay now ?
PENELOPE: Who 's dead ?
LOOSELEAF: My mother-in-law . Fire engines , pulmotors , doctors , cops , coroners
PENELOPE: What happened ?
LOOSELEAF: WellI walked up to the front door . I was still alive . Big surprise . I rang the doorbell , and old Mrs. Wheeler answered . She had he Goddamn knitting . I said , `` Guess who ? '' She conked right out .
PENELOPE: How horrible .
LOOSELEAF: Yeahcripes . I never did get any sense out of Alice . She found me holding up the old lady , dead as a mackerel . It was a bitch . You knowmaybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway , even if I 'd been the paper boy . Maybe not . I dunno , boy . That 's civilian life for you . Who knows what kills anybody ?
HAROLD: Could have happened to anybody .
LOOSELEAF: First Nagasakinow this .
HAROLD: How about breakfast , wife ?
PENELOPE: Breakfast ?
HAROLD: Scrambled eggs , kippered herring , fried potatoesand a whole onion . I want to eat the onion like an apple . Do you understand ? PENELOPE turns away .
PENELOPE: Mrs. Wheeler is dead .
HAROLD: All rightbring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler . Oh , hellsit down , Colonel . Penelope will bring you some chow .
PENELOPE: That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips .
HAROLD: Which one ?
PENELOPE: `` Bring me a side order of Mrs . Wheeler . ''
HAROLD: She 's up in Heaven now . She did n't hear . She is experiencing nothing ut pure happiness . There 's nothing nicer than that . Chow ! Harold Ryan wants chow !
PENELOPE: What a honeymoon .
HAROLD: Honeymoon temporarily canceled . The boy should still go out and exercise . I have the impression he never gets any exercise . He simply loats himself with Fig Newtons and akes his brains over steam radiators .
PENELOPE: You 're wrong .
HAROLD: Then let me see him go out and get some exercise . Right now !
PAUL: What kind of exercise ?
HAROLD: Beat the shit out of someone who hates you . PAUL exits . HAROLD pounds on a table .
PENELOPE: We 're all going to have to go out for breakfast . The cook quit yesterday .
HAROLD: You 're a woman , are n't you ? PENELOPE nods .
PENELOPE: People do n't use that word any more .
HAROLD: Do n't lecture me on race relations . I do n't have a molecule of prejudice . I 've been in battle with every kind of man there is . I 've been in bed with every kind of woman there isfrom a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian . If I 'd ever been to the South Pole , there 'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me . Cook !
PENELOPE: You leave me soso without without dignity .
HAROLD: People now have dignity when frying eggs ?
PENELOPE: They do n't have to feel like slaves .
HAROLD: Then go nowand fry with dignity sunnyside up .
LOOSELEAF: I dunno , boy .
HAROLD: The educational process .
LOOSELEAF: I guess . You 're lucky you do n't have any old people around here .
HAROLD: She was about to get married again . She locked me out of the bedroom last night .
LOOSELEAF: You know me , boy .
HAROLD: I should have torn that door off its hinges . Should have scrogged her ears off . Should have broken the bed . What do you want ? Well ?
PENELOPE: II was wonderingis there anything you should n't eatbecause of jungle fever ?
HAROLD: I could eat a raw baby crocodile . The way to get your wife back is in ed . Do such a job on her that she 'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours . We 're starving . Do you mind ?
LOOSELEAF: Excuse me .
HAROLD: One of them is the doctor , whose weapons are compassion , unselfishness , peacefulness maudlin concern .
LOOSELEAF: Huh .
HAROLD: He and his love are like a etiarius . Do you know what a etiarius is ?
LOOSELEAF: He 's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and does n't wear anything but a jockstrap .
HAROLD: How do you know that ?
LOOSELEAF: You told me .
HAROLD: When ?
LOOSELEAF: When we were up in the tree so longwith the bats .
HAROLD: Oh . I 'd forgotten .
LOOSELEAF: Fourteen times you told me . I counted .
HAROLD: Really ?
LOOSELEAF: You 'd get this funny look in you eyes , and I 'd say to myself , `` Oh , Jesushe 's going to tell me what a etiarius is again . ''
HAROLD: Sorry .
PENELOPE: No .
HAROLD: What then ?
PENELOPE: I do not wish to be scroggedever . I never heard that word , but when I heard it , I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me .
HAROLD: That 's what you 're supposed to say .
PENELOPE: This is not a coy deception . I do not want to be scrogged . I want love . I want tenderness .
HAROLD: You do n't know you want . That 's the way God built you !
PENELOPE: I will not be scrogged . I remembe one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers , and you promised me that the fish could n't feel .
HAROLD: It could n't !
PENELOPE: I 'd like to have the expert opinion of the fishalong with yours .
HAROLD: Fish ca n't feel .
PENELOPE: Well , I can . Some injuries , spiritual or physical , can be excruciating to me . I 'm not a silly carhop any more . Maybe you 're right about fish . When I was a carhop , I did n't feel much more than a fish would . But I 've been sensitized . I have ideas nowand solid information . I know a lot more nowand a lot of it has to do with you .
HAROLD: Such as ?
PENELOPE: The whole concept of heroismand its sexual roots .
HAROLD: Tell me about its sexual roots .
PENELOPE: It 's complicated and I do n't want to go into it now , because it 's ound to sound insultingeven though nobody means for anybody to e insulted . It 's just the truth .
HAROLD: I like the truth . I would n't be alive today if I were n't one of the iggest fans truth ever had .
PENELOPE: Wellpart of it is that heroes asically hate home and never stay there very long , and make awful messes while they 're there .
HAROLD: Go on .
PENELOPE: And they have very mixed feelings about women . They hate them in a way . One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently . They can scrog them , as you say for revenge .
HAROLD: You learned this in some college course ?
PENELOPE: I learned a lot of things in college . Actuallyit was Norbert who told me that .
HAROLD: The doctor .
PENELOPE: Yes .
HAROLD: And what is his most cherished possession ?
PENELOPE: His most cherished possession ? His violin , I guess .
HAROLD: And he keeps it in his apartment ?
PENELOPE: Yes .
HAROLD: And no one 's there now ?
PENELOPE: I do n't think so .
HAROLD: That 's too bad . I would rathe have him at hometo see what I 'm going to do .
PENELOPE: What are you going to do ?
HAROLD: He did his best to destroy my most precious possession , which is the high opinion women have of me . I 'm now going to even that score . I 'm going to break in his door and I 'm going to smash his violin .
PENELOPE: No you 're not !
HAROLD: Why not ?
PENELOPE: Because if you doI 'll leave you .
HAROLD: Goodbye . Blackout .
WANDA JUNE: We have this new club up here in Heaven .
VON KONIGSWALD: Yes , we do .
WANDA JUNE: We only have two members so far , ut it 's growing all the time .
VON KONIGSWALD: We have enough for a shuffleboard team . In Heaven , shuffleboard is everything . Hitler plays shuffleboard .
WANDA JUNE: Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard .
VON KONIGSWALD: Mozart plays shuffleboard .
WANDA JUNE: Lewis Carroll , who wrote Alice in Wonderland , plays shuffleboard .
VON KONIGSWALD: Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard .
WANDA JUNE: Walt Disney , who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , plays shuffleboard . Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard .
VON KONIGSWALD: It was almost worth the tripto find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy , playing shuffleboard . I like his sense of humor , thoughyou know ? He 's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears . You know what it says on the back ? `` Pontius Pilate Athletic Club . '' Most people do n't get it . Most people think there eally is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club .
WANDA JUNE: We 're going to have jackets , are n't we ?
VON KONIGSWALD: You bet ! `` The Harold Ryan Fan Club . '' Pink , eh ? With a yellow streak up the back . We got very good tailor shops up here . They 'll make you any kind of uniform , any kind of sweatsuit you want . Judas Iscariothe 's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart . He walks around all hunched over , and he never looks anybody in the eye , and written on the back of his jacket are the words , `` Go take a flying WANDA JUNE punches him in the ribs .
MILDRED: I heard you were looking for me .
VON KONIGSWALD: You were Harold Ryan 's third wife . Right ?
MILDRED: Yes .
VON KONIGSWALD: You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club ? Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back ?
MILDRED: Do I have to ? Who 's the little girl ?
WANDA JUNE: Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake . I do n't really know him .
MILDRED: Thought you were another wife , maybe .
WANDA JUNE: I 'm only ten years old .
MILDRED: That 's what he wanteda ten-year- old wife . He 'd come home from a war or a safari , and he 'd wind up talking to the little kids .
WANDA JUNE: Wo n't you please join our club ? Please ?
MILDRED: HoneyAlcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I 've gotand Harold Ryan is an individual I would ather forget . He drove me to drink . He drove his first two wives to drink .
VON KONIGSWALD: Because he was cruel ?
MILDRED: Premature ejaculation .
VON KONIGSWALD: Ach soooooooooo .
MILDRED: No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation . Harold would come home trumpeting and oaring . He would the kick the furniture with his boots , spit into corners and the fireplace . He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them . He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him , and he 'd tear off my clothes . He would carry me into the bedroom , telling me to scream and kick my feet . That was very important to him . I did it . I tried to be a good wife . He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo . I could n't do that , ut I pretended I did . It was all overten seconds after he 'd said the word `` buffalo . '' Then he 'd zip up his pants , and go outside , and tell true war stories to the little kids . Any little kids .
VON KONIGSWALD: That is sad .
MILDRED: Is it ? I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things .
VON KONIGSWALD: Ja ?
MILDRED: Never mind . It 's a dumb theory . I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexualbut alcohol . Peace .
LOOSELEAF: Go to the funeral ?
HAROLD: Of course ! Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform ! Rent a uniform !
LOOSELEAF: That 's against the law , is n't it ? I ca n't wear a uniform anymore .
HAROLD: Wear your uniform and every decoration , and let them despise you , if they dare .
LOOSELEAF: Alice would be absolutely tear-ass .
HAROLD: When I was a naive young recruit in Spain , I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings , shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos . I now understand It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of espect for men in uniform uncontrollable fear . To our women .
LOOSELEAF: I did n't know we had any women left .
HAROLD: The world is teeming with women ours to enjoy .
LOOSELEAF: Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap . Lion doorbell roars .
HAROLD: This could be my next wife .
SHUTTLE: Hello .
HAROLD: How are you , honeybunch ?
SHUTTLE: Is Penelope in ?
HAROLD: The posies are for her ?
SHUTTLE: I wanted to apologize .
HAROLD: You 've come to the right man .
SHUTTLE: I forgot my vacuum cleaner .
HAROLD: I forget mine for years on end .
SHUTTLE: Oh my God And you are Looseleaf Harper .
LOOSELEAF: Hi . SHUTTLE faints .
HAROLD: It 's what I 've dreamed of all my life , Looseleaf ! To have a grown man realize who I wasand faint ! End of Act Two . Blackout .
MILDRED: Two days later . The afternoon of the day of Looseleaf Harper 's mother-in-law 's funeral . You got it ? Two days later . You know what happened in Heaven today ? There was a tornado . I 'm not kidding youthere was a Goddamn tornado . Tore up fifty-six houses , a dance pavilion and a Ferris wheel . Drove a shuffleboard stick clear through a telephone pole . Nobody got killed . Nobody ever gets killed . They just bounce around a lot . Then they get up and start playing shuffleboard . I never saw a tornado when I was alive , and I grew up in Oklahoma . There 's this big , black , funnel- shaped cloud . Sounds like a ailroad train without the whistle . I had to come to Heaven to see a thing like that . A lot of people got photographs . After the tornado was over , a man had some film left and he wanted to take pictures of meto use up the oll . I do n't like people who go around taking pictures of everything . Nothing 's real to some people unless they 've got photographs . Two days laterright ?
LOOSELEAF: I told you the uniform would n't help .
HAROLD: It helped more than you know . Down deep , people were deeply affected .
LOOSELEAF: You keep on saying `` deep '' and `` deeply . '' I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime .
SHUTTLE: I ca n't get over how you guys are my friends . Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends .
HAROLD: Our pleasure .
SHUTTLE: Eight years you guys were together through thick and thin .
HAROLD: For seven and a half of those years we were heavily druggedor we would have been home long before now , believe me . We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians , who fed us a strange blue soup .
SHUTTLE: Blue soup .
HAROLD: It sapped our willmade us peaceful and unenterprising . It was a form of chemical castration . We became two more sleepy Indians .
LOOSELEAF: So , kidhow they hanging ? O do n't you say that to a little kid ?
HAROLD: He 's a man . Tell him you 're a man .
PAUL: I 'm a man .
HAROLD: We 've got to do something to make this boy 's voice change . I wonde if we could n't get bull balls somewhere , and fry 'em up . Still miss your mother ?
PAUL: No .
HAROLD: You 're free to go to her , if you want . If you 'd rather be a woman and run with the women , just say the word .
SHUTTLE: Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die ?
HAROLD: I 'd rather go to Viet Nam .
SHUTTLE: Would somebody please pass me the catsup ?
HAROLD: What you say is , `` Pass the fucking catsup . ''
SHUTTLE: Pass the fucking catsup .
LOOSELEAF: I do n't think I 'll go .
HAROLD: Of course you 'll go ! You 're going to fly the helicopter .
LOOSELEAF: I dunno .
HAROLD: You 're so low ! Look at that eautiful red meat . You have n't touched it .
LOOSELEAF: Sorry . At least you 've got a place to come back to . I do n't have a place to come back to anymore .
HAROLD: All the more reason to go to Africa .
LOOSELEAF: I dunno . You know . I used to really love that Alice . Do you know that ?
HAROLD: You know her for what she is now garbage .
LOOSELEAF: I dunno .
HAROLD: She was always a rotten wife ! She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do . He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time , and his wife made him quit . She made him ecome a life insurance salesman instead .
SHUTTLE: I 'd think any woman worth her salt would be proud to be married to a test pilot . I know I would .
LOOSELEAF: She tried to like it . She was a very nervous woman .
SHUTTLE: I could tell that at the funeral . Would you please pass the fucking catsup again ? Was it dangerous testing planes ?
LOOSELEAF: I dunno . Who knows ? You know you 're up there , and you 're in some plane nobody ever flew before . You put her into a dive , and everything starts screaming and shaking , and maybe some pipe breaks and squirts oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid in your face . You wonder how the hell you ever got in such a mess , and then you pull back on the controls , and you black out for a couple of seconds . When you come to , everything 's usually fairly okayexcept maybe you threw up all over yourself . It 's just anothe job , but you try and tell Alice that .
HAROLD: Insurance !
SHUTTLE: You actually sold insurance !
LOOSELEAF: I tried . I sold him some . That was the only insurance I ever sold . Hyena doorbell laughs .
SHUTTLE: What an awful sound !
HAROLD: Get used to it . Back door , Paul . PAUL exits to the kitchen .
SHUTTLE: I 've considered that .
HAROLD: Selling vacuum cleaners is n't the est preparation you could have .
SHUTTLE: I just want one true adventure efore I die .
HAROLD: That can be arranged .
PAUL: Dad ?
HAROLD: Who was it ?
PAUL: It 's Mom .
LOOSELEAF: Hi , Penelope .
HAROLD: Shut up , you ninny ! You were never to come here again for any reason whatsoever !
PENELOPE: I came for my clothes .
HAROLD: Sneaking in the back door .
PENELOPE: I rang . It seemed like the prope door for a servile , worthless organism to use .
HAROLD: Your clothes are at the city dump y now . Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation .
PENELOPE: I came for Paul as well .
HAROLD: If he wants to go .
PENELOPE: You took him to the funeral , I hear .
HAROLD: He 'd never seen a corpse . He 's seen a dozen now .
PENELOPE: A dozen ?
HAROLD: It 's a big and busy funeral home .
PENELOPE: Did you like it , dear ?
HAROLD: It is n't a matter of liking . It 's a matter of getting used to death as a perfectly natural thing . Would you mind leaving ? No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan , and then comes backfor anything .
PENELOPE: Unless she has nerve .
HAROLD: More nerve than the doctor , I must admit . He has n't been home for two days . Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and colo televisionand the violin ?
PENELOPE: He knows you shattered his violin .
HAROLD: I 'm dying to hear of his reaction . The thrill of smashing something is n't in the smashing , but in the owner 's reactions .
PENELOPE: He cried .
HAROLD: About a broomstick and a ciga oxand the attenuated intestines of an alley cat .
PENELOPE: Two hundred years old .
HAROLD: He feels awful losswhich was precisely my intention .
PENELOPE: He had hoped that someone would be playing it stilltwo hundred years from now .
HAROLD: Hope .
SHUTTLE: You 're making a joke .
HAROLD: I 'm interested in long-term expectations .
SHUTTLE: It 's engineered to last about fifteen years .
HAROLD: Things . Ohyou silly people and your things . Things , things , things .
PENELOPE: You and Harold are friends ?
SHUTTLE: He 's the most wonderful guy I eve met , Penelope . He 's the most complicated guy I ever met . I ca n't believe it , but he 's going to take me to Africa with him .
HAROLD: Things .
PENELOPE: You feel I 've done a dreadful thingleaving him ?
SHUTTLE: If I were married to him , I sure would n't walk out .
HAROLD: Never mind the condition of you ody and your spirit ! Look afte your things , your things !
PENELOPE: And you , Colonel ? Let me guess You do n't know .
LOOSELEAF: I dunno .
HAROLD: Go live in a safe-deposit boxwith your things .
LOOSELEAF: JesusI would n't want to be married to him . You know ?
HAROLD: What 's this ?
LOOSELEAF: I would n't want to be married to me . We 're too crazy . You know ?
HAROLD: In what way , pray tell ?
LOOSELEAF: I did n't like that violin thing . That was sad .
HAROLD: Tit for tatas simple as that .
LOOSELEAF: You never played a violin .
HAROLD: You did ?
LOOSELEAF: Yeah . I practically forgot . But after you busted that thing , I got to thinking , `` Jesusmaybe I 'll start the violin again . '' That did n't just belong to Woodly . That elonged to everybody . Maybe he would have sold it to me , and I could have some fun . After you usted the violin , boy , and Penelope walked out , I thought to myself , `` Jesuswho could blame her ? ''
HAROLD: Maybe it 's time you got out .
LOOSELEAF: Me ?
HAROLD: You .
LOOSELEAF: Okay . Okay .
HAROLD: You 're an imbecile .
LOOSELEAF: I know you think that .
HAROLD: Everybody thinks that .
LOOSELEAF: Anybody who 'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb .
HAROLD: The one direct , decisive , intelligent act of your life !
LOOSELEAF: I do n't think so . It could have been .
HAROLD: If what ?
LOOSELEAF: If I had n't done it . If I 'd said to myself , `` Screw it . I 'm going to let all those people down there live . ''
HAROLD: They were enemies . We were at war .
LOOSELEAF: Yeah , Jesusbut wars would be a lot better , I think , if guys would say to themselves sometimes , `` JesusI 'm not going to do that to the enemy . That 's too much . '' You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there , even though you do n't know how to make a violin , just by not busting it up . I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki , and the mother , too , just by not dropping the bomb . I sent 'em to Heaven insteadand I do n't think there is one .
HAROLD: Goodbye , Looseleaf .
LOOSELEAF: So long , you guys .
PENELOPE: What will you do , Colonel ?
LOOSELEAF: I dunno . Marry the first whore who 's nice to me , I guess . Get a job in a motorcycle shop . So long , you guys .
SHUTTLE: Who 's going to fly our helicopter now ?
HAROLD: What ?
SHUTTLE: We got to get another pilot .
HAROLD: For what ?
SHUTTLE: For Africa .
HAROLD: Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman ?
SHUTTLE: You invited me .
HAROLD: To make an ass of yourself .
SHUTTLE: What went wrong ?
HAROLD: We 're ahead of schedule , that 's all . You 're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa that you are a rabbit , born to be eaten alive .
SHUTTLE: Gee whiz
HAROLD: It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us .
SHUTTLE: I would n't drop my gun .
HAROLD: You 're hollow , like a woman .
SHUTTLE: I 'm smarter than Looseleaf .
HAROLD: He can shoot ! He can hold his ground ! He can attack ! You 're in your proper profession right now sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives , closet drunkards every one .
SHUTTLE: How do you know how I 'd act in Africa ?
HAROLD: Look how you 're acting now ! This is a moment of truth , and you 're almost crying . Slug me !
SHUTTLE: You 're my buddy .
HAROLD: Out ! Out !
SHUTTLE: No matter what you say to me , I still think you 're the greatest guy I ever knew .
HAROLD: Out !
SHUTTLE: Youyou are n't going to have any friends left , if you do n't watch out .
HAROLD: Thank God !
PENELOPE: Almost a Christmas scene .
HAROLD: Goodbye , goodbye , goodbye .
PENELOPE: Just one favor .
HAROLD: Money ? There 's plenty of that . Mildred got the brewery . You 'll probably get the baseball team .
PENELOPE: I want you to tell me that you loved me once .
HAROLD: Testimonials of that sort areare eyond my range . I do n't do them well . That 's a failing , I know .
PENELOPE: I see .
PAUL: I do n't care . I do n't care if there was love or not . That 's all ight . I 'm going to go to my room and close the door . I do n't want to hear any more . PAUL exits wretchedly to his room .
HAROLD: See how you 've upset him . He was so merry and hale before you came home .
PENELOPE: How unhappy he 's going to bealone in his room .
HAROLD: He 'll play with his rifle , I expect . That will cheer him up .
PENELOPE: Rifle ?
HAROLD: I bought him a twenty-two yesterdayon the way home from Hamburger Heaven . And where is the good doctor ? Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere ?
PENELOPE: He 's in East St. Louis with his mothervisiting an aunt .
HAROLD: Last I heard , his mother was going alone .
PENELOPE: He 's afraid of you , Harold . He knew you 'd want to fight him . He does n't know anything about fighting . He hates pain .
HAROLD: And you , a supposedly healthy woman , do not detest him for his cowardice ?
PENELOPE: It seems highly intelligent to me .
HAROLD: What kind of a country has this ecome ? The men wear beads and efuse to fightand the woman adore them . America 's days of greatness are over . It has drunk the blue soup .
PENELOPE: Blue soup ?
HAROLD: An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink . It put us in a hazea honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge . We laughed , we sang , we snoozed . When a bird called , we answered back . Every living thing was our brothe or our sister , we thought . Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long , and we cried . We had a funeral that went on for five daysfor the cockroach ! I sang `` Oh Promise Me . '' Can you imagine ? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to `` Oh Promise Me '' ? Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36 . All the time we were drinking more blue soup , more blue soup ! Never stopped drinking blue soup . Blue soup all the time . We 'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze , and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender .
PENELOPE: Sounds quite beautiful .
HAROLD: Beautiful , you say ? It was n't life , it was n't deathit was n't anything ! Beautiful ? Seven years gone like that , like that ! Seven years of silliness and random dreams ! Seven years of nothingness , when there could have been so much !
PENELOPE: Like what ?
HAROLD: Action ! Interaction ! Give and take ! Challenge and response ! He splits a coffee table with the ax .
PAUL: Mom ?
HAROLD: What 's this ?
PAUL: Nothing .
HAROLD: That 's a rifle you have ?
PAUL: No .
HAROLD: Of course it is . Is it loaded ?
PAUL: No .
HAROLD: Open the bolt ! PAUL obeys . A cartridge pops out .
PAUL: I was cleaning it .
HAROLD: Pick up that cartridge and slip it ack into the chamberwhere it elongs .
PAUL: Gee whiz , Dad
HAROLD: Welcome to manhood , you little sparrowfart ! Load that gun !
PAUL: Dad
HAROLD: Too late ! It 's man to man now . Protecting your mother from me , are you ? Protect her ! `
PENELOPE: He 's a child !
HAROLD: With an iron penis three feet long . Load it , boy .
PENELOPE: You 're begging him to kill you ?
HAROLD: If he thinks he 's man enough .
PENELOPE: That 's really what you want . You ecome furious when people wo n't make you dead .
HAROLD: I 'm teaching my son to be a man .
PENELOPE: So he can kill you . You hate you own life that much . You beg for a hero to kill you .
HAROLD: I plan to live one hundred years !
PENELOPE: No you do n't .
HAROLD: If that 's the casewhat 's to prevent my killing myself ?
PENELOPE: Honor , I suppose .
HAROLD: What a handsome word .
PENELOPE: But it 's all balled up in your head with death . The highest honor is death . When you talk of these animals , one by one , you do n't just talk of killing them . You honored them with death . Haroldit is not honor to be killed .
HAROLD: If you 've lived a good life , fought well
PENELOPE: It 's still just death , the absence of lifeno honor at all . It 's worse than the blue soup by far that nothingness . To you , though , it 's the honor that crowns them all .
HAROLD: May I continue with the rearing of my son ? Load that gun ! PAUL shakes his head .
PAUL: I do n't want to fight you .
HAROLD: Get mad ! Tell me you do n't like the way I treat your mother ! Tell me you wish I 'd never come home !
PAUL: It 's your house , Dad .
HAROLD: Everybody simply evaporates ! There are guest issues to be fought out hereor to be argued , at least . The enemy , the champion of all who oppose me , is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt ! I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin .
PENELOPE: The old heroes are going to have to get used to this , Haroldthe new heroes who refuse to fight . They 're trying to save the planet . There 's no time for battle , no point to battle anymore .
HAROLD: I feel mocked , insulted , with no sort of satisfaction in prospect . We do n't have to fight with steel . I can fight with words . I 'm not an inarticulate ape , you know , who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary . Call him up in East St. Louis , Penelope . Tell him to come here .
PENELOPE: No .
HAROLD: No . Pause . He contemplates PAUL .
PENELOPE: I do n't know . I hope he neve hunts . I hope he never kills another human being .
HAROLD: You hope this , too ?
PAUL: I do n't know what I hope . But I do n't think you care what I hope , anyway . You do n't know me . You do n't know her , either . I do n't think you know anybody . You talk to everybody just the same .
HAROLD: I 'm talking to you gently now .
PAUL: Yeah . But it 's going to get loud again .
PENELOPE: He 's right , Harold . To you , we 're simply pieces in a gamethis one labeled `` woman , '' that one labeled `` son . '' There is no piece labeled `` enemy '' and you are confused . Lion doorbell roars . PAUL goes to answer it .
HAROLD: There wo n't be anybody out there . That 's the new style nobody anywhere .
PENELOPE: Get out of here .
WOODLY: It 's really that bad ? He comes farther into the room , bravely .
PENELOPE: You fool , you fool .
WOODLY: Ohlook at the poor , crucified violin , would you ?
HAROLD: It died for your sins .
WOODLY: This little corpse is intended as a lesson ?
HAROLD: There 's a certain amount of information there .
WOODLY: Lest we forget how cruel you are .
PENELOPE: I 'm going to call the police .
HAROLD: Do n't !
WOODLY: I agree .
HAROLD: This is man to man .
WOODLY: It 's healer to killer . Is that the same thing ?
HAROLD: What brought you back ?
WOODLY: The same hairy , humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon . `` Honor , `` if you like .
HAROLD: He 's a champion after all .
WOODLY: Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instructionwhen all we can learn from them is this how cruel you are .
PENELOPE: This is suicide . Go get the police .
HAROLD: Stop ! PAUL stops .
WOODLY: Yes .
HAROLD: I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers . But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words . The truth ! Correct ?
WOODLY: Correct .
HAROLD: What an hallucination ! Oh , dear , dear , dear , dear . Oh dearie me .
WOODLY: You have n't heard me yet .
HAROLD: You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice ? Will I bleed from my every orifice ? Who will clean up this awful mess ?
WOODLY: We 'll find out now , wo n't we ?
PENELOPE: No , we wo n't . No matter how it egins , it will end in death . Because it always does . Is n't that always how it ends , Haroldin death ?
HAROLD: There has to be a threat of some sort , nobility of some sort , glamour of some sort , sport of some sort . These elements are lacking .
WOODLY: You 're a filthy , rotten bastard .
HAROLD: Oooooo . That hurt .
WOODLY: You 're oldso old .
HAROLD: Now who 's being cruel ?
WOODLY: A living fossil ! Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs .
HAROLD: We do survive , do n't we ? You 're going to have to apologize , of course , for calling me a bastard . That 's a matter of formnot allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard . No rush about that . Just remember to apologize sometime soon . PENELOPE takes the rifle from PAUL .
WOODLY: You 're a son of a bitch .
HAROLD: Yeswelluhthat 's another one of those statements which more o less automatically requires an apology . Whenever you feel like it . It 's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that 's ringing loudly . Your apology turns off the alarm .
PENELOPE: I 'm turning off the alarm . I 'm turning off everything .
HAROLD: Ah ! The lady is armed .
PENELOPE: I want you to get out of here , Norbert . HaroldI want you to sit down in the chair , and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone .
HAROLD: Whoever has the gun , you see , gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do . It 's the American way .
PENELOPE: I mean it !
HAROLD: Then you 'd better fix your bayonet , ecause there are n't any bullets in the gun .
PENELOPE: Where 's the bullet ? PAUL makes no move to help .
HAROLD: Help your mother find the bullet .
PENELOPE: There it is . Give it to me . PAUL obeys .
HAROLD: Load it for her . PAUL shakily obeys .
PENELOPE: All right ! Am I exceedingly dangerous now ?
HAROLD: The National Safety Council would e appalled .
PENELOPE: Then listen to me . You 're both disgustingwith you pride , your pride . I hate you for coming herelike a federal marshal in a western film . I loved you when you stayed away . But here you are nowhigh noon in the Superbowl ! You fool , you fool .
WOODLY: Everything 's going to be beautiful .
PENELOPE: You fake ! You 're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon . You 're not going to beat Harold . You 're not going to beat anybody . You 're not going to stay here , eitheryammering and taunting until you 're most gloriously killed . Go home !
HAROLD: She 's right , Norbertgo home .
WOODLY: I have n't said all I have to say .
PENELOPE: Out !
WOODLY: I have n't told you , Harold , how comical I think you are .
HAROLD: Comical ?
PENELOPE: Sit down or I 'll shoot !
HAROLD: Give me that Goddamn thing ! Now get out of here , or I might kill you . Who knows ?
PENELOPE: You 've killed women ?
HAROLD: Seventeen of themeleven by accident . March ! Move ! You , too ! PENELOPE and PAUL move toward the front door .
PENELOPE: Norbertyou come , too . Let him go , Harold . Let him go .
HAROLD: Of course he can goif he 'll just go down on his hands and knees fo a momentand promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree .
PENELOPE: Do it , Norbert .
WOODLY: Hands and knees , you say ?
HAROLD: And terror , if you do n't mind .
PENELOPE: Do it !
WOODLY: Goodbye .
HAROLD: Goodbye ! Goodbye !
WOODLY: I 'm high as a kite .
HAROLD: Glands . You 're supposed to be happy when you die . Call me comical again .
WOODLY: You 're a clown . You 're a clown who killsbut you 're a clown .
HAROLD: I love you ! Have a cigar !
WOODLY: Evolution has made you a clown with a cigar . Simple butchers like you are obsolete !
HAROLD: I 'm to be left behindin primordial ooze ?
WOODLY: If you 're at home in the ooze , and nowhere else .
HAROLD: This is going to become very physical . Are you prepared for that ?
WOODLY: You 're not such a creature of the ooze that you 'd hurt an unarmed man .
HAROLD: I 'm an honorable clown ?
WOODLY: King Arthur .
HAROLD: You hope .
WOODLY: In any event , I will not beg fo mercy .
HAROLD: No quarter asked . No quarter given .
WOODLY: Do n't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew ?
HAROLD: Cut me open . Find out .
WOODLY: I 've struck my blow .
HAROLD: With spittle ?
WOODLY: I 've poisoned you .
HAROLD: Lucretia Borgia ? Something I drank or touched ? You refused a cigar . That 's it ! Potassium cyanide in the humidor ! Treacherous lover of peace !
WOODLY: I put a poisoned thought in you head . Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of you mind . It 's saying , `` Obsolete , obsolete , obsolete , '' and , `` Clown , clown , clown . ''
HAROLD: Poison .
WOODLY: You have a very good mind , or I would n't have come back . That mind is now asking itself , cleverly and fairly , `` Is Harold Ryan really a clown ? '' And the answer is , `` Yes . ''
HAROLD: II really must congratulate you . Something is happening in there .
WOODLY: You can never take yourself seriously again ! Look at all the creatures you 've protected us from ! Did you shoot them on the elevator , as they were on their way up here to eat us alive ?
HAROLD: No .
WOODLY: The magic root you gave meI had it analyzed . It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893 ! He explored your famous jungle fo five years , armed with nothing but kindness , a talent for languages , and a pocketknife .
HAROLD: I see .
WOODLY: You are n't going to hurt me . You are n't going to hurt anybody any more . Any violent gesture will seem ridiculousto yourself !
HAROLD: Don Quixote .
WOODLY: My violin is avenged !
HAROLD: Something seems to have happened to my self-respect .
WOODLY: And the hell with it . It was so tragically irrelevant , so preposterously misinformed .
HAROLD: The new hero is you .
WOODLY: I hate crowds , and I have no charisma
HAROLD: You 're too modest .
WOODLY: But the new hero will be a man of science and of peacelike me . He 'll disarm you , of course . No more guns , no more guns .
HAROLD: Was I ever of use ?
WOODLY: Never . For when you began to kill for the fun of it , you became the chief source of agony of mankind .
HAROLD: Here . Finish the job .
WOODLY: I 'm utterly satisfied .
HAROLD: You 're making a mistake . Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded . You 've wounded me .
WOODLY: More clowning ! Do n't you see ?
HAROLD: We never quit fighting until we 're dead .
WOODLY: You 'd be killing a friend . Do n't you know how much I like you ?
HAROLD: I 'm going to shoot you now .
WOODLY: No !
HAROLD: My self-respect is goneand my soldier 's honor with it . It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man .
WOODLY: New dignity can be yoursas a merciful man . You can change !
HAROLD: Like the saber-toothed tiger .
WOODLY: Oh Godyou 're really going to kill me .
HAROLD: It wo n't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee . Heaven is very much like Paradise , they say . You 'll like it there .
WOODLY: Can I beg for mercyon my knees ?
HAROLD: If you want to be found that way .
WOODLY: What is this thing that kills me ?
HAROLD: Man , as man was meant to bea vengeful ape who murders . He will soon be extinct . It 's time , it 's time .
WOODLY: Do n't shoot .
HAROLD: I 've enjoyed being man . He aims the rifle tentatively .
WOODLY: No . No .
HAROLD: Get up .
WOODLY: No .
HAROLD: Have it your way . We 'd both be etter off dead now .
WOODLY: Thank God .
HAROLD: Crawl home .
WOODLY: Thank youfor my life .
HAROLD: It 's trash now , like mine .
WOODLY: New lives begin !
HAROLD: Somewhere in this city . Not here , not here . Tell Penelope I loved herin my clownish way . And Paul . Tell him to be a healer , by all means .
WOODLY: What are you going to do ?
HAROLD: Use the sanitary facilities , if I may .
WOODLY: Leave the rifle here .
HAROLD: I 'll put it in Paul 's room , where it belongs .
WOODLY: Give me your word of honor that that 's all you 're going to do .
HAROLD: For what it 's worth now , Harold Ryan , the clown , gives his sacred word .
WOODLY: Harold ?
HAROLD: I missed .

JIM: Mr. Mehlor , I believe we 're gon na need your science project .
RAY: `` I shall bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy all that lives unde the heavens and every creature that has the breath of life in it shall perish . '' Genesis 6 17 .
KENNY: Were you a preacher or something ? Ray laughs .
MR. MEHLOR: Ray did five years in the hole at Joliet . The only thing you get to ead in the hole is the Bible .
KENNY: You got religion ?
RAY: Obviously .
MR. MEHLOR: When you hit the switch you 've got thirty seconds .
RAY: You teach your students how to make things like that ? Mr. Mehlor puts the device on the back door .
MR. MEHLOR: You been to a high school recently , Ray ? My students taught me how to make things like that . Ready ?
JIM: Hold on .
RAY: Now why 'd he have to go and do a thing like that ?
JIM: To stay alive . He thinks we 'll kill him unless he knows where the money is and we do n't .
MR. MEHLOR: There is another possibility . He 's thinking of keeping it fo himself .
JIM: There 's always that . Either way , we got ourselves a sharp one .
KENNY: What do we do ? Jim is looking at something in the distance .
JIM: Pretty soon the water 'll be too deep for him to run . But for us it 'll be just deep enough .
KENNY: Deep enough for what ?
JIM: Here we go .
KENNY: What about this monster ?
JIM: This is all we need .
RAY: Shit , Jim , we 're stealing . Ca n't we take anything we want ?
JIM: The water is n't very deep yet . We need something with a low draft . Mr. Mehlor find us some gasoline . Mr. Mehlor heads off .
JIM: Cut your engines !
JIM: Let 's get him out . But for Godsake , whatever you do do n't kill him . Not until we find out where he hid that money .
RAY: Kenny ?
RAY: See him ?
KENNY: Nice driving , buttwipe !
RAY: I 'm glad you 're enjoying this , Kenny , ut if he 's dead , how do we find the money ? Kenny reacts oh , right .
JIM: Oh , he 's still alive . We see what Jim sees .
RAY: `` With a raging flood he makes an end of those who oppose him , and pursues his enemies into darkness . '' From one of the more obscure
KENNY: Sorry to interrupt Bible study and all , but has no one but me noticed how completely screwed we are ? We should be back in the motel room , counting out the money . Instead
JIM: No one likes this particular turn of events , Kenny , but we have a choice we can can either deal with it or we can walk away . There 's a lot of money out there , so I choose to deal with it . If you want to go , that 's fine start swimming . You want to stay , that 's fine , too just stop you damn whining .
KENNY: What the hell 's his problem ? All the money in the world ai n't worth a goddamn nickel if you get caught . It 's not like there wo n't be othe jobs .
RAY: You may have more of these in you , Kenny , but Jim does n't .
WAYNE: I sure as hell do n't get what you see in that church .
KAREN: I would n't expect you to , Wayne .
WAYNE: What 's that supposed to mean ?
SHERIFF: Karen , did you think the order was for everyone but you to evacuate ?
KAREN: I was gon na go as soon as I filled the pumps , but the next thing I know , I 've got a looter on my hands . Now , maybe I 'm crazy , but I was expecting a little gratitude ?
PHIL: I think it 's great what you did .
WAYNE: That 's it , Phil . That 'll finally get you into her pants .
PHIL: Shut up .
SHERIFF: What if he 'd had a gun , Karen ? A lot of these looters carry guns .
RAY: Jim , it could be anywhere . It might not even be in the school .
JIM: Keep looking .
WAYNE: What were you doing at the church ?
KAREN: I told you he was looting it .
TOM: I just said I 'm not a looter ! You 're the one who nailed me ? You got a better arm than my ex-wife . What the hell did you hit me with a statue ? I saw a flash of some guy coming at me .
KAREN: It was a crucifix . It was the only thing there !
TOM: Oh , great . Now I 'm gon na have people coming from around the world to see the face of Jesus on my forehead .
SHERIFF: Look , son , what were you doing in the church ?
TOM: Looking for a place to hide out .
WAYNE: From who Swamp Thing ?
TOM: The bastards who killed my partner . That stops the room .
SHERIFF: How much money did you have ?
TOM: A little over three million .
WAYNE: They stole three million dollars ?
SHERIFF: No , I do n't think so .
TOM: I hid it in the cemetery . Tied it to a crypt for a guy named Portman .
WAYNE: What the hell 'd you do that for ?
TOM: I do n't like to carry around that much cash .
SHERIFF: Jesus , Wayne , use your head . If he had n't hidden it , they woulda killed him , too .
TOM: No , it was in my jacket and I
WAYNE: Color me surprised .
SHERIFF: Get out two rifles and a shotgun .
WAYNE: You believe him ?

KAREN: Did you see the stained glass windows , Phil ? Did you see what a good jo they did ? I ca n't let anything happen to the church , not after all I 've put into it .
PHIL: Karen , you know I 'd do anything fo you , but the Sheriff told me to get you out of town . I 'm sorry . It 's fo your own good . Karen stands up .
KAREN: If you 're not going to take me back to the church , then I 'll swim . Karen moves to get out of the boat .

KAREN: They 'll get him out .

TOM: If they know where the money is , they will kill us .

TOM: I guess just drive around until we un out of gas .
KAREN: Look , I 've spent the last eight months of my life restoring that church , and I just left it to come save you ass , so spare me , okay ?
TOM: When we get down here a little furthe we 'll find a place for you to hide . I 'm gon na get back to the truck and wait for the National Guard . They should be there pretty soon .

TOM: I , uh I sold construction machinery . I was making good money , it just I do n't know . It just did n't seem ight for me anymore .

TOM: God , I wonder whose car this is .
KAREN: Well , whoever it is , he listens to Pat Benatar , Eddie Money and the soundtrack to `` Footloose . ''
TOM: Really ? Hold on I think this is my car from high school . Karen laughs . Just then
TOM: Looks like we get out here . Come on I told your father I 'd have you home by ten . Karen grins . Just then
TOM: There !
TOM: Get your feet up !
TOM: Oh , shit !
KAREN: What ?
TOM: It 's metal !
TOM: We 've got ta ! Kenny shoves Tom underwater .
KENNY: HEY ! I GOT HIM !
TOM: We have to ! Kenny dunks Tom again .
KENNY: I GOT HIM !
KAREN: Hurry !

HENRY: Jesus , Doreen , you caught a whole gang .
KENNY: Jesus , God , it hurts !

MR. MEHLOR: Yeah , Kenny . You 're gon na be fine .
KENNY: Jesus , I ca n't stop shivering .

JIM: See ? You got ta trust me .
DOREEN: Well , is n't that just wonderful ! Now these bastards are gon na want to kill us , too ! Why the hell did you have to come to this house ?
KAREN: We thought it was empty .
DOREEN: You know what ? The house next doo is empty . So whaddya say we go back downstairs and you two keep moving ?
HENRY: We are not going to send these people out to the wolves .
DOREEN: Oh , we 're not , are we ? Then what 's your plan , General Schwartzkopf ?
HENRY: I I just do n't think
TOM: It 's okay . I have to go anyway . They look at him , surprised .
DOREEN: You ca n't swim that far in fifteen minutes .
HENRY: He could take our boat .
DOREEN: Henry !
HENRY: I 'll go get it ready for you .
DOREEN: Henry , he is not taking our boat .
TOM: Karen ? I 'm Tom . They shake hands .
KAREN: Watch yourself , Tom . I really do n't wan na have to save your life again . Tom nods and goes down the stairs .
DOREEN: You give away our only boat in the middle of a flood . You are a genius , Henry . A goddamn genius .
TOM: You wan na come with me ?
DOREEN: Jesus , Henry , what are you waiting for a kiss goodbye ? Get back in here .
RAY: Why do n't we just get him ?
JIM: If our resourceful young friend hears us coming , he 'll electrocute us o sink us or one of you 'll shoot him . Besides I know where he 's going . What I 'd like to know is where he came from .
WAYNE: They 're not here .
JIM: Son , before you go underwater and do something tricky , there 's something I 'd like you to see !
JIM: Now , I know it 's your job to protect that money , and maybe you 'd even be foolish enough to give your life fo it . The question is , are you willing to give their lives for it ? Jim puts a pistol to Doreen 's head .
JIM: Excellent choice .
TOM: I 'll take you to the money , but you got ta let them go .
DOREEN: I hope you 're proud of yourself , Henry Sears .
HENRY: Shh .
JIM: I think it 'd be best if
DOREEN: I told you not to give him the goddamn oat .
HENRY: Doreen , please .
JIM: I think it 'd be best if we all stayed together .
TOM: You say all you want is the money ? Prove it . Let them go .
JIM: I do n't know if that 's
DOREEN: We could be safe in our home instead of out here in a boat with these low- life scumbags !
JIM: Let 'em go .
TOM: Karen ?
HENRY: In the attic . They never saw her .
DOREEN: Faster , Henry ! The bastards might change their minds ! Stop lily- dipping and move it ! Henry starts to turn the boat around .
HENRY: I 'm gon na row back there and see if he 'll shoot you . Or me . Fine eithe way .
DOREEN: Henry ?
HENRY: Do you want me to get us out of here ?
DOREEN: Yes , of course , I
HENRY: Then shut the fuck up .
JIM: The only thing I want to hear from you is where the money is .
JIM: I wonder where they think they 're going .
RAY: What the hell 's going on ?
MR. MEHLOR: This happened in a flood in Georgia . The ground gets soggy , and the caskets are air-tight anyone who has n't een planted too long just pops up .
RAY: You teach your students stuff like that ? No wonder they kicked you out .
MR. MEHLOR: I did n't teach my students anything at all .
JIM: Where is it ?
TOM: It 's hard to tell now with the wate so deep .
KAREN: Tom went off in their rowboat .
WAYNE: It 's Tom now . Looks like you lost out , pal .
SHERIFF: Where was he going ?
KAREN: Back to the armored truck .
JIM: Here ?
TOM: Uh no . A little farther
JIM: They 're not coming , son .
TOM: What ?
JIM: The National Guard . They 're not coming .
TOM: I do n't
JIM: I know you 've been trying to stall until they show up , but they 're not coming .
TOM: Oh , God . You intercepted Charlie 's call , then you called them off .
JIM: No , son , I did n't call them off . They never were coming . We did n't `` intercept '' Charlie 's call . He called us direct . And on Tom 's look of disbelief
HANK: I 'd love to help you , Sheriff , but I ca n't leave ! If the water goes ove the top again it 's bye-bye , dam ! Bye- ye , town ! In fact , I could use a little help up here myself .
SHERIFF: Hank , remember when Mike Crane holed up in Jack Finch 's barn and said he was gon na burn it down ?
HANK: Hey , I was the one who got the dum son-of-a-bitch to come out .
SHERIFF: Right . And before you went in , I deputized you , you dumb son-of-a- itch ! So when I say get down here , it 's not a request , it 's an order . So get down here ! Now ! I wo n't need you for long . And bring your gun .
JIM: We were gon na hit you just before you got on the Interstate , but then you got stuck so we had to change our plans and take you
TOM: Bullshit . This is all bullshit .
JIM: I knew Charlie when we were both working construction for the Johnstown company . His middle name was McCarthy ecause his parents loved Charlie McCarthy on the radio . His wife 's name was Mary . She died of a heart- attack last year . He has a daughte and a son , both grown with children of their own . I 'm afraid I do n't know the names of the grandchildren . Tom looks down , not wanting to believe .
TOM: Why 'd you shoot him ? Kill Charlie and you get to keep another share ?
JIM: No , That was an accident . Ken shot him . I never told him Charlie was on my side . Ken liked to talk . He shouldn't 've been here . But his dad asked me to watch over him . I guess I did n't do the best job .
RAY: Excuse me , Jim . I hate to interrupt and all , but could we just get the money and get the hell out of here ?
JIM: I 'm gon na ask you one more time . And efore you think of bullshitting me again , keep in mind I have had a very frustrating night . And while I know I 'll never get the money if I kill you , it 's getting to the point where I just do n't care . Jim casually aims his gun at Tom .
TOM: I 'll tell you where it is . But it 's not going to do you any good . Jim arches an eyebrow .
JIM: I 'll take my chances . Tom pauses , looks over to
TOM: There .
JIM: Well , go get it .
RAY: `` At night we 'd go down to the rive and into the river we 'd dive . '' Springsteen , `` The River . '' I 'm all out of bible quotes .
TOM: It 's gone .
JIM: What ?
TOM: Looks like somebody beat you to it .
RAY: Oh for Christs I 'm gon na shoot him , Jim .
KAREN: Stop ! You 'll hit Tom !
SHERIFF: Hold your fire ! Wayne and Phil stop shooting .
JIM: Now , sir , I can imagine you 'd love nothing more than to shoot me , but I caution you in order to do that , you 're gon na have to shoot through young Tom here .
SHERIFF: Okay . He raises his rifle .
TOM: Well , that was unexpected .
JIM: Is he the one you thought was coming to your rescue ? No answer from Tom , but the answer is clear .
SHERIFF: Hey , Hank . That money I told you about ? From the armored car ? We 're gon na keep it . Three million dollars . Four ways . Seven fifty apiece . You okay with that ? Hank is stunned . He does n't answer .
HANK: Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars ? Damn straight I 'm okay with that .
WAYNE: Do n't see what we needed him for .
SHERIFF: Then I guess you 've never been hunting with Hank . We got two behind that crypt . Get 'em .
PHIL: Maybe I 'm not okay with it .
SHERIFF: Come on now , Phil .
PHIL: You 're gon na kill people ?
SHERIFF: They 're looters , Phil ! They come and steal from an armored truck in ou town they 're looters .
PHIL: What about Tom ? What about Karen ? They 're not looters .
SHERIFF: No , they 're witnesses . The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets .
PHIL: How can you do this ?
SHERIFF: Jeez , Phil , I always thought Wayne was the stupid one . Read my lips . Three million dollars . Look at it !
PHIL: But but you 're the Sheriff !
SHERIFF: I 'm the what ?
PHIL: For twenty years you 've been
SHERIFF: For twenty years I 've been eating shit , breakfast , lunch and dinner . Well , tonight I 'm changing the menu ! From now on everything I eat is gon na e shit-free !
SHERIFF: Can I make it any clearer , Phil ? Do you want me to draw pictures ?
PHIL: I ca n't let you do it .
SHERIFF: Oh for Okay , Phil . But here 's how it 's gon na go . I 'm gon na hear one of two things out of you . Either I 'm gon na hea you say you 're in with us , or I 'm gon na hear a bullet come out of that gun and go into me .
TOM: You really want that money ?
JIM: Here .
TOM: They 're not going to catch us now .
JIM: Yeah .
TOM: Good .
SHERIFF: Then go get some bottles . Hank nods , guns his engine .
PHIL: Wait what about the dam ?
SHERIFF: It 'll be fine .
PHIL: You said if it goes it 'll wipe out the town .
SHERIFF: Fuck the town . Hank nods in agreement and takes off .
JIM: Does he have the girl ?
TOM: She 's in the small boat . Tom touches the wound on his head .
JIM: Hepatitis , hell . You probably already got cholera .
TOM: There 's a back room . Maybe they 've got something I can use on this .
JIM: You been in here before ?
TOM: Oh , yeah .
JIM: What happened ?
TOM: I saw Jesus .
JIM: Everything would have gone fine if you'd 've just walked away from the truck .
TOM: Oh , yeah ? Well , everything would 've gone even better if you had n't decided to rob the damn truck in the first place ! Jim looks away . After another silence
JIM: You mean why was he doing this ? No cancer . Did n't you ever think about taking the money ?
TOM: No .
JIM: Come now . A man who used to make his living fencing hot jackhammers neve thought about what he 'd do with three million dollars ?
TOM: Sorry to disappoint you . What are you gon na do with it ?
JIM: As little as possible . Silence for a few moments , then
TOM: Belize . Jim looks at him .
JIM: I know where Belize is . What about it ?
TOM: They speak English and the dolla goes a long way . Beautiful beaches ; friendly people . And they 've got liberal banking laws . Very liberal .
JIM: No , you did n't think about taking that money at all .
TOM: You ca n't ride in the truck and not think about it .
JIM: I 'm sure . And I guess that 's pretty much how it started with Charlie .
SHERIFF: What 're you doing ?
WAYNE: We got too many bodies with bullets in 'em . I 'm gon na put her in her house , make it look like she fell down the stairs and drowned .
PHIL: Do n't you touch her !
WAYNE: Saving her life Hmm You know , that might have actually gotten you laid .
SHERIFF: Oh , for Christsakes , just dump he here .
WAYNE: We got a few minutes before Hank gets back .
SHERIFF: Just dump her here ! Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off .
TOM: Shit . Where 's he going ? Tom grabs a rifle , frustrated and angry .
HANK: Where 's Wayne going ?
SHERIFF: On a date . You all set ?
HANK: Yeah , but
SHERIFF: Then let 's go .
HANK: Are n't we gon na wait for Wayne ?
SHERIFF: We can get started without him , the dumb shit . He wo n't be long . Besides , we got Phil . Phil 's gon na earn his money on this , are n't you Phil ? Phil looks scared shitless .
JIM: What you 're gon na swim after her ?
TOM: The Sheriff knows . I think maybe I 'll go ask him .
JIM: You 'll be dead before you get ove the sandbags . Look , he 'll be coming for us . You can ask him then . Jim sees something out the window .
TOM: What if he does n't come ?
JIM: I would n't worry about that . Tom sees what Jim sees .
WAYNE: Wakey-wakey .
KAREN: Sorry , Wayne , but I 'm not playing a part in your sick little play . Wayne pulls his gun , puts it to Karen 's head .
WAYNE: You 're perfect for the role . I suggest you reconsider .
KAREN: Or what ? You 'll kill me ? You 're gon na do that anyway .
WAYNE: I might get clumsy . It might take a while .
KAREN: I 'm sure you can hurt me . But it 's all going to be the same when I 'm dead .
WAYNE: And she said , `` Happy Birthday , Wayne . I 've got something for you . '' Well , I 'm not stupid . I knew what she wanted to give me and I knew she wanted to give it bad , so I
KAREN: Happy Birthday , Wayne .
SHERIFF: They 're not coming out , Hank !
HANK: The fire 's not catching . The rain 's too
SHERIFF: We have to get them ! We have to kill them ! Do you understand ? If they 're not dead , we got jack shit !
TOM: My God they 're beautiful .
KAREN: There have to be keys . There She sees
SHERIFF: Where are they ? ! Jesus !
SHERIFF: You take care of him !
HANK: Kill him !
JIM: In the boat .
TOM: Where is she ?
SHERIFF: They went back to her house .
TOM: Where 's her house ?
SHERIFF: It 's
JIM: What in God 's name is that ?
SHERIFF: Hank ?
HANK: It 's topped out .
SHERIFF: How much time we got ?
HANK: How should I know ?
SHERIFF: Guess !
HANK: It 's an old dam ! Not long .
SHERIFF: Then I 'd say you boys better drop your guns .
TOM: What ?
SHERIFF: That 's the deal ! You let me and Hank go with a few of these bags and I 'll tell you where to find Karen .
JIM: Get out of the boat .
TOM: Hold on . Jim turns to look at Tom .
JIM: Hold on ?
SHERIFF: It 's the only way you 're gon na find her !
TOM: It 's only a couple of bags .
JIM: No .
TOM: But I thought
JIM: Look , I do n't know what you thought ut I told you , I 'm here for the money ; that 's all .
SHERIFF: So , you just gon na kill me ?
JIM: Lord knows I should .
KAREN: I 'm handcuffed . Tom reaches into the water for the railing .
TOM: Where ?
KAREN: In the kitchen . In the tall cupboard eside the
TOM: Is that good or bad ?
SHERIFF: You should 've just killed me .
KAREN: You got ta go ! Tom starts hyperventilating .
TOM: I owe you one . Tom breathes deep then ducks underwater .
PHIL: NOOOO !
HANK: We got ta go faster !
SHERIFF: Yeah , you 're right . The Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat .
HANK: Oh my God . Hank looks around for safety . He sees it .
DOREEN: Come on , Henry . Forget that `` Go to the light '' crap . Come back to me . You 're all I 've got . And Henry starts to come to .
HENRY: Next time , when I say `` Let 's evacuate , '' we 're gon na evacuate .
DOREEN: Whatever you say , honey .
JIM: Fine .
TOM: Oh , God . We got ta get you to
JIM: For what ?
TOM: You just saved our lives .
JIM: I did ? I just came for the money . Tom looks at Jim he knows Jim 's lying .
TOM: It 's okay ! Jim lets go of Tom .
JIM: You 're going to turn it in ?
TOM: Sorry to disappoint you .
JIM: Well , hell , then I guess I bette take it after all . I figure the iver 'll carry me down to the Gulf of Mexico . If I catch the right currents , maybe I 'll end up in Belize ? You come look me up . I 'll buy you a drink .
TOM: I 'll do that .
JIM: Go . Tom hesitates for a second .
TOM: They got a lot done today .
KAREN: It 's coming along . What 'd you get ?
TOM: Barbecue chicken from Lilly 's .
KAREN: Yum .
TOM: You want some ? I wish you 'd told me . I woulda got more .
KAREN: Ha ha .
TOM: I talked to Mikey . He says the flooring should be in by Friday .
KAREN: That 's what he said last week .
TOM: I said if it was n't here by Friday at six that you were going to go over and beat the crap out of him .
KAREN: And I will .

TRENT: I did n't think you would . Sit down . Take a load off .
STORM: Still in the camera .
TRENT: Good . Very good . That way I know you have n't duplicated it . Storm inches slightly closer .
STORM: You know , Trent I could rip your fucking throat out before that sonofabitch over there could find the spit to sneeze .
TRENT: Oh , I 'm sure you could , Storm . But not before one of those othe gentlemen , across the way , could put a fifty-caliber slug through your brainpan .
STORM: Very well placed , Trent . But did you know that human reaction time even the fastest is between half and three-quarters of second ? And in that time , I could easily
TRENT: You could kill me now , Storm but you 'll die two seconds later .

STORM: I 'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife .
STORM: Vernon , oh , Verrrrrnon , where are you ?
STORM: You know , Trent , I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself . But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you , and that a nice petite white-bread oy like you in a federal penitentiary let me put it this way I doubt whether you could remain anal etentive for very long . Yeah I think that 's best for you
ANDY: Hey ! Why 'd you do that ?
SONNY: Who 's there ?

DR. WOODRUFF: Excellent , Kumar . I have to say you 're one of the best applicants I 've eve interviewed . Not that it 's a surprise . Your father is very respected in his field . You know he and I had some pretty wild times when we were in med school .
KUMAR: Really ?
DR. WOODRUFF: Yeah . We started our own basketball team the Hemoglobin Trotters Yeah , we were crazy .
KUMAR: Let 's see . There might be epigastric tenderness , diffuse abdominal tenderness
HAROLD: I 'm not gon na be able to partake in ou usual Friday night ritual . I 've got ta stay late at the office .
KUMAR: Fuck that shit ! We had plans !
HAROLD: I know , but I got ta get this work done .
KUMAR: Oh come on ! When has getting high eve prevented you from finishing your work ?
KUMAR: Okay , where was I ? Oh yes . More symptoms of pancreatitis . Umdecreased owel sounds , possibly fever , dehydration , and sometimes even shock .
DR. WOODRUFF: Mr. Patel . This is supposed to be a proper interview . Do you actually believe after the way you 've behaved that I would ever even consider recommending you fo admission ?
KUMAR: No . I 'd actually be pretty surprised .
DR. WOODRUFF: Butyou have perfect MCAT scores !
KUMAR: Well , I 'm not an idiot . Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words .
HAROLD: Yes ! Right in front
COLE: This is America , dude ! Learn how to drive !
HAROLD: Okay , be yourself . Do n't be nervous .
MARIA: Oh , nothing . It 's just been a long week . How about you ?
HAROLD: My week was great . Work was n't too bad . I caught up on some sleep . Plus , the guy who works next to me decided to bathe fo a change .
MARIA: Really ?
HAROLD: Oh wait , I meant the exact opposite of that . Work sucked . I barely slept . And the guy next to me still smells like crap . But a man can dream , right ?
MARIA: Actually , I 'm probably gon na work out a little bit , clean up the apartment , and then go over to my boyfriend 's place . He 's cooking me a really nice dinner .
HAROLD: Really ?
MARIA: Oh wait , I meant the exact opposite of that . I 'll actually probably just sit on my ass , eat a pint of Hagaan Daz , and watch Blind Date .
HAROLD: That sounds awful .
MARIA: Maybe .
HAROLD: Bye .
KUMAR: I 'm trimming my pubes .
HAROLD: Why are n't you doing this in your room !
KUMAR: The mirror 's in here . Hey , check it out ! It looks like a Bonsai tree !
HAROLD: I 'm gon na puke . Get your clothes on .
KUMAR: Chill out . It makes my Johnson look igger . Besides , if I do n't do this , I 'll end up with pubes like my dad . You 've seen Osama Bin Laden 's beard , right ? HAROLD notices something
HAROLD: Are those my scissors ? Oh my God ! I trim my nose hair with those !
KUMAR: Dude , I 've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months .
KUMAR: So what the hell is your problem , anyway ?
HAROLD: One of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight . Kumar walks back into Harold 's room
KUMAR: I assume you gave him the appropriate `` go fuck yourself . ''
HAROLD: If by `` go fuck yourself '' you mean `` no problem sir '' then yes , he got the message loud and clear . KUMAR shakes his head in disgust
KUMAR: Oh , no wonder you tried cancelling on me today . Dude , you got ta learn how to say `` no '' once in a while . Now lets get high .
HAROLD: No . I got a lot of work to finish . Kumar shuts Harold 's laptop .
KUMAR: Fuck that ! You 'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later . Come on , let 's smoke a couple joints . Harold thinks for a moment and then caves
HAROLD: One joint .
KUMAR: One and a half . Now let 's do this Kumar exits the room
HAROLD: Do n't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously ? At some point your dad 's gon na get really pissed .
KUMAR: So what ? It 's not like there 's a shortage of Dr. Patel 's out there . My dad 's a doctor . My brother 's a doctor . Just because everyone in my family went to med school , does n't mean I have to .
HAROLD: Well , then what are you going to do ?
KUMAR: I 'll tell you what I 'm gon na do . I 'm gon na smoke this fat blunt , get idiculously high , and then get something to eat .
HAROLD: Sounds like a plan .
KUMAR: I think we 've already seen this one . Harold changes the channel
NEWSCASTER: Tonighta Cheetah escaped from the Morristown Zoo ANGLE - Harold and Kuma
HAROLD: Nice . Sixteen Candles is on .
KUMAR: And the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to
HAROLD: Oh come on . It 's a John Hughes movie ! It 's a classic ! It 's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed , unappreciated , unloved
KUMAR: Hey look ! It 's you !
HAROLD: We 're so high right now .
KUMAR: We 're not low .
HAROLD: I do n't know about you , but I 'm hungry as alls .
KUMAR: No shit ! Let 's eat !
HAROLD: What about KFC ?
KUMAR: Nah , we 've been there too many times . I want something we have n't had in awhile . Something different . Something that 'll really hit the spot . I want the perfect food
HAROLD: You 're sure you know how to get there ? I have n't been to White Castle in ages .
KUMAR: I 'm telling you , there 's one right around the corner from that multiplex in New Brunswick .
ROSENBERG: Wait we 're watching The Gift on HBO .
KUMAR: No waiting . We 're starving
GOLDSTEIN: Sorry man ! We 're not going anywhere . Supposedly , Katie Holmes shows her milk paps in this movie !
HAROLD: Is that all you Jews ever think about ? Tits ?
ROSENBERG: We 're talking about Katie Holmes here . You would never think a sweet , innocent girl like her would ever take her top off . Which is precisely why we have to watch her do it .
GOLDSTEIN: Dude , the things I 'd eat out of her ass , you have no idea . Bacon , shellfish , milk with meat , you name it
ROSENBERG: That 's a very vulgar statement .
GOLDSTEIN: So is `` I want to pound Britney Spears in the pussy . '' But it 's true .
ROSENBERG: Touché . Anyway , if you guys want to wait till the movie 's over HAROLD and KUMAR have already shut the door .
KUMAR: What the hell are you bringing that for ? Harold hands Kumar his keys .
HAROLD: You 're driving . I 'm gon na try to get some of my work done in the car .
KUMAR: Shit , I forgot my cell phone .
HAROLD: Why do n't you just run back and get it ?
KUMAR: Nah , we 've gone too far .
HAROLD: I 'm not worthwhile .
KUMAR: Dude , it 's only awkward because you 're a pussy . Just talk to her once and I promise you it wo n't be weird anymore
HAROLD: It does n't matter . The only girls interested in me are girls I have no interest in . Like Cindy Kim .
KUMAR: Speaking of Cindy , she called earlier . One of those 58 Asian clubs she 's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight .
HAROLD: God , she invites me to everything .
KUMAR: So what ? She 's fucking cute . Let he touch your penis . They exit the front door of the building
COLE: Hey look , it 's the Brother 's McFag ! Let me guess , the yellow one 's the catcher !
HAROLD: Why do I have to be the catcher ?
KUMAR: Dude , forget about those pricks . Let 's just go . They continue walking
HAROLD: Do n't even start .
KUMAR: Just fucking with you . Now let 's go out and get those burgers . I 'm fucking starving !
HAROLD: Of course he 's gay ! You remember in the first Star Wars when he was like `` Thank the maker ! This oil bath is going to feel soooo good ! '' Kumar laughs .
KUMAR: Dude , give me thirty-five cents .
HAROLD: I do n't have anymore change .
KUMAR: Should I just go through ?
HAROLD: No . I do n't like breaking the law .
KUMAR: I can see that .
HAROLD: Just hold on . I 'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened .
KUMAR: What the fuck is wrong with you ? !
HAROLD: You just tore out of there ! The cops are gon na catch us !
KUMAR: No they 're not !
HAROLD: Take this exit !
KUMAR: What ?
HAROLD: Look , I get a little paranoid sometimes .
KUMAR: Now we 're in Newark of all places . You know we 're gon na get shot .
HAROLD: Maybe it 's not as bad as they say . It 's probably just a bunch of hype .
KUMAR: We have to if we want to get out of here .
HAROLD: Forget about it . No way .
KUMAR: Come on . How do you know they 're not peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys ?
HAROLD: Turn the car around .
KUMAR: Why ? Are cars not allowed to go through when a game 's going on ? When we were kids , we used to move to the side when we were playing in the street .
HAROLD: For some reason , I do n't think this is the same thing .
KUMAR: I 'm going through . KUMAR begins inching forward .
HAROLD: Do n't !
KUMAR: Look . They 're moving . I told you .
HAROLD: Shit , he 's gon na throw the ball at us .
KUMAR: How do you know ?
HAROLD: Look at him !
KUMAR: Oh fuck .
HAROLD: That was close , dude .
KUMAR: Rold , check it out ! We 're almost there !
HAROLD: Yes ! Thank God ! I 'm starving !
KUMAR: Well , prepare to gorge yourself .
HAROLD: Oh man , I 'm so hungry . I 'm gon na eat like twenty of those burgers .
KUMAR: I 'll see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries .
HAROLD: God , where the hell is this place ?
KUMAR: Do n't worry , we 'll find it . HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead
HAROLD: There 's the multiplex !
KUMAR: That means the White Castle should be just around the corner
HAROLD: What the hell 's going on , Kumar ? ! That does n't look like a White Castle to me !
KUMAR: We got ta get to the bottom of this !
HAROLD: Are you sure ?
KUMAR: Shit . What are we gon na do ?
HAROLD: I do n't know . Should we just eat here ?
KUMAR: Do you really think that 'll satisfy us ?
HAROLD: Kumar , I have a shitload of work to finish . And you have that med school interview in the morning .
KUMAR: Forget about the med school interview . It 's a non-issue .
HAROLD: Let 's do it .
KUMAR: Then it 's settled . No matter what , we 're not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs . Agreed ? KUMAR puts his hand out . HAROLD shakes it .
HAROLD: Agreed .
KUMAR: White Castle , here we come . I just wish we had some more pot . I 'm almost completely sober right now .
HAROLD: Why ?
KUMAR: We 're gon na sweet talk Cindy Kim into finding us some weed .
HAROLD: Oh no . I 'm not seeing Cindy .
KUMAR: Why the fuck not ? You talk to her on the phone all the time .
HAROLD: She calls me . Then she rambles on about her East Asian Students club or whatever .
KUMAR: A twinkie ?
HAROLD: You know , yellow on the outside , white on the inside .
KUMAR: Look you twinkie bitch , you threw ou weed out the window , so now it 's you duty to make sure we 're high as shit by the time we 're eating those burgers .
HAROLD: Well , I ca n't help you out there . Cindy does n't smoke . She 's not gon na help us .
KUMAR: As long as she buzzes us into a dorm , we 're set . Give me ten minutes in there and I guarantee I 'll find some hizzy .
HAROLD: No , forget it . I 'm not seeing Cindy Kim .
CINDY: I 'm so glad you showed up , Harold !
HAROLD: Yeah . Me too .
CINDY: Did you like the Hibiscus petals I glued to the envelope I sent you ?
HAROLD: Uh , yeah . They werenice .

CHRISTY: Hurry up , I want to go smoke pot with that cute Indian bloke .
CLARISSA: It 'll be a few minutes , I 'm about to have the worst case of the taco shits . KUMAR is clearly upset to hear this .
HAROLD: Ewgross .
CHRISTY: Oh great . Now I think I have to go .
CLARISSA: Ahhhhh !

SECURITY GUARD: Well , well , well . What have we here ?
HIPPIE ASSHOLE: Aw , dude ! Do n't take it ! It 's mine !
KUMAR: I ca n't believe it . We were this close to getting high and getting laid .
HAROLD: Oh , come on , you always exaggerate . We were n't gon na get laid .
KUMAR: Hey , the diarrhea twins would 've had sex with us ! And what about Cindy ? ! She was looking hot tonight ! The fact that you 're not into her just might make you gay !
HAROLD: I know Cindy 's cute , it 's just
KUMAR: What ? You 'd rather have Maria ?
HAROLD: Look , it does n't matter . I 'm gon na end up with Cindy anyway . It 's just more practical . Now can we drop this and get our asses to White Castle ?
KUMAR: Fine .
HAROLD: Now what are you doing ?
KUMAR: Daddy needs to urinate . Harold rolls his eyes .
CREEPY GUY: What do you mean ?
KUMAR: Why did you decide to piss here right next to me ? Why not that bush over there ?
CREEPY GUY: Well , this looked like a good bush to pee on . Why 'd you choose this bush ?
KUMAR: Nobody was here when I chose this bush .
CREEPY GUY: So you can pee here and nobody else can , is that it ?
KUMAR: I was just saying .
CREEPY GUY: Is this like your special bush o something ?
KUMAR: No , I just You know what ? Forget about it . I 'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now .
CREEPY GUY: Nice pubes .
KUMAR: Thanks .
HAROLD: Do you even know where you 're going ?
KUMAR: I 'll be honest , I 'm a little lost . But do n't worry . Once we get on the highway , we 'll be there soon .
HAROLD: We better . It starts to rain
KUMAR: What 's the big deal ?
HAROLD: Look , I 'm completely on edge right now , okay ? After all the shit we 've been through tonight , I do n't know how much more of this I can take .
KUMAR: Holy shit !
HAROLD: Shit ! It bit my neck ! I probably have abies now or something !
KUMAR: Do n't worry . He did n't even break you skin . You 'll be fine .
HAROLD: Oh , that 's not good !
KUMAR: Ahh ! Dude , get that fucking cance accoon away from me ! ! !
HAROLD: Uh-oh .
GOLDSTEIN: What the hell do you think you were doing ? You almost killed us ! GOLDSTEIN sees that it 's HAROLD and KUMAR .
KUMAR: Goldstein ? HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief .
GOLDSTEIN: Dude , it 's Rold and Kumar !
KUMAR: What the hell are you guys doing here ?
ROSENBERG: We got the munchies , so we 're out trying to find a Hot Dog Heaven .
HAROLD: We have n't gotten there yet . I think I got rabies , though .
KUMAR: Dude how were Katie Holmes ' tits ?
GOLDSTEIN: You know the holocaust ?
KUMAR: Yeah .
GOLDSTEIN: Picture the exact opposite of that .
KUMAR: Nice .
ROSENBERG: Apologize to Hashem .
GOLDSTEIN: Who the hell is
ROSENBERG: Just apologize !
GOLDSTEIN: Okay , I 'm sorry .
ROSENBERG: You really need to meet a girl .
KUMAR: Well , if you have the yellow feve tonight , there 's a rocking Asian party over at Princeton tonight .
GOLDSTEIN: Man , I have the yellow plague . There 's nothing sexier than a hot Asian chickor dude for that matter
HAROLD: Will you stop it ? I 'm feeling very woozy . I may have to go to the hospital .
KUMAR: Dude , you do n't have rabies ! We 're not going to the hospital .
GOLDSTEIN: Yo , we got ta hit this Asian party .
ROSENBERG: Oh no ! No more detours ! Let 's just stick with the plan and get to Krispee Kreme . You guys would n't believe some of the weird shit we 've been through the last couple hours .
HAROLD: I do n't have rabies . Kumar stands up quickly .
KUMAR: Great , let 's get out of here .
HAROLD: Oh , now I see why you did n't want to come to the hospital .
KUMAR'S FATHER: I hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today . Dr. Woodruff is a very good friend of mine , and let 's just say he was not at all amused by your anticsand neither am I .
SAIKAT: What the hell 's wrong with you , Kumar ? Look at me . I own my own house . I drive a eamer . And I get laid whenever I want . You can have all that too , if you 'd just get off your ass and go to med school .
KUMAR: Eat my balls , Saikat .
SAIKAT: God , you 're 22 years old already ! When are you gon na grow up and stop with this post-college rebel bullshit ? Like you life is so tough .
KUMAR'S FATHER: I will not tolerate this business from you any longer . You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one I 'm setting up for you .
KUMAR: Oh , come on , dad !
KUMAR'S FATHER: `` Daddy will not be coming on anything ! '' You will be there and you will behave ! I 've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up .
KUMAR: You 're right . I 'm sorry .
KUMAR'S FATHER: Good . I 'll speak with you tomorrow .
HAROLD: Wow . So I guess you 're going to med school after all , huh ?
KUMAR: Fuck that ! Like I care what my dad thinks . I ca n't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the interview tomorrow . He wants to cut me off ? Fine ! I do n't need his money !
HAROLD: Butyou just hugged him
KUMAR: I just needed to get my hands on these
HAROLD: If we get caught , you 're taking the lame . This was n't my idea .
KUMAR: We 're not gon na get caught . We 're gon na get toasted and then we 're gon na eat delicious White Castle just like we planned .
MALE NURSE: Dr. Patel , thank God I found you ! I need your help immediately !
HAROLD: What the hell 's going on here ?
KUMAR: He must think I 'm Saikat . Do n't worry . Leave the talking up to me .
MALE NURSE: The patient was brought in by EMS five minutes ago . He has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior abdomen . No exit wounds .
HAROLD: Oh shit ! This guy 's gon na die ! ! !
MALE NURSE: It 's a good thing I found you two . All the other surgeons are working on othe patients The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument .
HAROLD: Wait . Hold on . You see you got this all wrong . We 're not doc
KUMAR: What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest . HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous .
MALE NURSE: Alright . I 'll get the anesthesiologist .
KUMAR: Hold on . What we should probably use is marijuana . That 'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery .
MALE NURSE: Marijuana ? But why
KUMAR: We do n't have time for questions ! We need marijuana now ! Get as much of it as possible ! Like a big bag of it !
MALE NURSE: But doctor , we do n't have marijuana in this hospital . HAROLD gives KUMAR a dirty look .
KUMAR: Shit .
MALE NURSE: We 're losing him ! You got ta do something !
KUMAR: Very well . I guess we 'll have to do this the old fashioned way .
MALE NURSE: Doctor ! The patient is desatting ! Kumar quickly examines the patient 's chest
KUMAR: Ah , I see . The Patient 's got a collapsed lung . Get me a 14-gage Angiocath , stat ! After a couple seconds go by
MALE NURSE: Great catch doctor ! His sat is up to 94 !
KUMAR: Will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up ? A chorus of `` yes , doctors . ''
HAROLD: I 'm telling you . That was amazing ! Even your dad would 've been impressed !
KUMAR: Yeah . It was n't bad .
HAROLD: This is perfect ! We 're back on the road . We have directions now . The rain let up . And guess what
KUMAR: Hey , check it out ! Your movie 's playing .
HAROLD: Holy shit .
KUMAR: You see ? You thought you two had nothing in common . But it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies . Hey , you wan na see if she wants to come with us to White Castle ?
HAROLD: No way . Forget about it . Just drive .
KUMAR: Harold . It 's one in the morning . We 're an hour from home . And who do we see , but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie . I mean , if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy , and I was your annoying gay friend , this would be the moment I 'd tell you `` this is a sign . ''
HAROLD: Stop it .
KUMAR: Come on . Just pretend you 're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she 's a hot Latina Meg Ryanwith bigger tits . Besides , you yourself said things are starting to go our way
HAROLD: Let 's just go !
KUMAR: Hey Maria !
HAROLD: You asshole ! My car 's probably all scratched up now !
KUMAR: Do n't blame me . You 're the one who ran us off the road !
HAROLD: I told you I did n't want to speak to her ! Whatever . Let 's jut get back on the highway .
KUMAR: Fine .
HAROLD: Godammit . You know how to change a flat ?
KUMAR: Please . Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire .
HAROLD: Where 's my spare tire ?
KUMAR: I do n't know .
HAROLD: Shit , where the hell is it ? Kumar suddenly remembers
KUMAR: Oh yeah ! Do n't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float ?
HAROLD: What bridge ? What the hell are you talking about ?
KUMAR: Oh shit . That 's right . I was with Goldstein . We borrowed your car that day . My bad .
HAROLD: Your bad ? What are the hell are we gon na do now ? !
UGLY MAN: You boys need some help ?
HAROLD: Thanks for helping us out .
FREAK SHOW: No problem at all . Saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself , `` what would Jesus do ? ''
UGLY MAN: Great . Good to hear it . The name 's Randybut everyone calls me Freak Show .
KUMAR: I 'm Kumar . This is Harold . Good to meet you , MrFreak Show .
FREAK SHOW: Pleasure 's all mine .
HAROLD: So where exactly are we going ?
FREAK SHOW: Do n't worry . My place is n't too far from here . Once we get there , I 'll have you ide fixed up in a jiffy .
KUMAR: Eww check out those boils on his neck !
HAROLD: Will you shut up ? He 's right next to me ! He can hear you !
KUMAR: Now there 's some sort of puss ! It 's the most disgusting thing I 've ever seen !
HAROLD: What 's the matter with you ? You think that just because you 're whispering , he ca n't hear what you 're saying ? He 's two feet away from us . He can hear this entire conversation . He can hear me talking right now .
KUMAR: Do n't worry , he ca n't hear anything . Not with all that crust in his ear .
FREAK SHOW: I heard every word you said .
KUMAR: Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife ?
HAROLD: He could n't have said that .
KUMAR: But he did ! It may have been in mid- sentence , but it was still clear as day .
HAROLD: Who cares ? You 've seen Freak Show . What do you think his wife is gon na look like ?
LIANE: Hi . I 'm Freak Show 's wife , Liane . Would you boys like some pink lemonade ?
HAROLD: Okay . It 's official . We 've entered the Twilight Zone .
KUMAR: Dude , Liane is fucking hot !
HAROLD: She 's not ugly .
KUMAR: Thanks . So , tell me Liane how are things etween you and Freak Show presently ?
LIANE: Oh , never been better . We love each other very much .
HAROLD: Can I ask how does a guylike Freak Showend up with a woman like yourself ?
LIANE: Well , I met him at choir practice ` bout four years ago . Freak Show was very shy ack then you know , because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck . But he had the most amazing voice like a aby canary .
KUMAR: Rock , paper , scissors to see who goes first ?
HAROLD: Wait a second what about Freak Showand this whole Christian thing you guys have going on ?
LIANE: Oh , so just because we 're passionate about our Lord , you assume we do n't know how to have a good time ?
HAROLD: No , I just
LIANE: Sorry if you boys want me , you got ta do me at the same time .
HAROLD: Huh ?
LIANE: Come on . Give me the double stuff . HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused .
KUMAR: I 'm not sure we quite understand
LIANE: I want you both inside me simultaneously .
KUMAR: Um , are we talking about one hole or two ?
LIANE: However you want to do it .
HAROLD: Sorry , no thank you .
KUMAR: Shh ! Two holes it might not be that bad . Shotgun anus !
HAROLD: Forget it ! I do n't want our balls ubbing against each other . No way ! KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation
KUMAR: What about blow jobs ? ! Can we get blow jobs ! ?
LIANE: Wellokay . Can you help me with this ?
HAROLD: Okay , let 's do that .
FREAK SHOW: Hey boys I changed your tire FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE

FREAK SHOW: I most certainly did not say that !
KUMAR: No . You did . We both heard you .
FREAK SHOW: Are you sure ?
KUMAR: Positive . FREAK SHOW ponders this .
FREAK SHOW: Ohmy mistake then .
KUMAR: No problem .
FREAK SHOW: Well , since we 're all here , why not make it a foursome ?
KUMAR: Okay , let 's agree never to talk about what just happened .
HAROLD: Agreed .
KUMAR: Dude , I have no idea where we are .
HAROLD: And get chopped to bits ? Are you crazy ? Kumar pulls over to the side of the road
KUMAR: Oh , calm down . We 're lost . He may know how to get us back on the highway .
HAROLD: Fuck that ! It 's my car ! We 're not picking up a hitchhiker !
NEIL: Yo , man , thanks for picking me up .
HAROLD: Uhexcuse me , butare you Neil Patrick Harris ?
NEIL: Yep .
KUMAR: Holy shit , dude ! Doogie Howser , M.D . was my favorite TV show growing up ! You were my idol !
NEIL: Hey , that 's great . Do you think we could get going ? I 'm bored as shit back here .
KUMAR: So , Neil , I have to ask you did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set ?
NEIL: Dude , I humped every piece of ass ever on that show .
KUMAR: Even the chick who played the hot nurse ?
NEIL: No , I did n't go all the way with her .
HAROLD: Hey , you do n't know how to get back on the highway , do you ?
NEIL: I do n't even know where the fuck I am ight now . I was at this party earlie tonight , and this dude hooked me up with some killer X . Somehow I ended up getting thrown out of a moving car , and I 've been tripping balls ever since .
KUMAR: Well , our night 's been pretty crazy too . We 've been driving around for hours , trying to get to White Castle , but we keep getting sidetracked .
NEIL: Dude , forget White Castle . What we need is some pussy .
HAROLD: Huh ?
NEIL: It 's a fucking sausage fest in here . Let 's get us some poon-tang . Then we 'll go to White Castle .
KUMAR: You do n't understand , Neil . We 've been craving these burgers all night .
NEIL: I 've been craving burgers too . Fu urgers , that is .
KUMAR: Hey , there 's a gas station ! Let 's stop and get directions .
HAROLD: We 'll be right back , Neil .
KUMAR: I do n't know . But we ca n't let him interfere with our quest .
COLE: Late night math league meeting , homos ?
HAROLD: Oh shit . These idiots .
INDIAN CASHIER: Pleasethe piesdo not
HAROLD: Excuse me can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here ? The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders .
KUMAR: He probably ca n't speak English
HAROLD: Huh ? Oh , good .
COLE: That was so fucking extreme , man !
HAROLD: Somebody should do something .
KUMAR: Hey asshole ! Why do n't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something .
HAROLD: I did n't mean you should do something .
KUMAR: Shit . Cole and the Punks burst out laughing .
COLE: Yeah , that 's right , bitch ! Try fucking with me one more time . Just try it !
KUMAR: Come on , lets get out of here .
COLE: Thank you , come again !
HAROLD: Kumar you okay ?
KUMAR: Yeah , I just hate those dicks . Fuck it . At least now we know where we 're going . I 'm so friggin ' hungry
HAROLD: Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car ?
KUMAR: I think he did .
KUMAR: Rold , calm down !
HAROLD: Why the hell did you leave the keys in the car ? !
KUMAR: I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy . How was I supposed to know that he 'd fuck us over ?
HAROLD: This is all your fault ! This whole fucking night ! You know I leased that car ! They 're gon na make me pay for it !
KUMAR: Where are you going ?
HAROLD: I 'm going to call the police ! I do n't want to talk to you anymore !
KUMAR: There 's a pay phone across the street , if you do n't want to deal with those assholes .
HAROLD: I 'm not speaking to you .
KUMAR: You know , pressing the button a bunch of times does n't make the sign change any faster . The computer responds to the first press . Every press after that is extraneous .
HAROLD: Thank you , Mr. Wizard .
KUMAR: This is ridiculous . Just walk across .
HAROLD: It 'll change in a second .
KUMAR: Come on , there 's not a car in sight !
HAROLD: Alright fine . You want me to cross ? I 'll cross . Just leave me alone !
KUMAR: Finally .
HAROLD: Shit !
OFFICER PALUMBO: Is there a problem ? Ever hear of jaywalking ?
HAROLD: Yes . Yes I have . I 'm so sorry . I promise I 'll never do it again .
OFFICER PALUMBO: Yeah , like I give a fuck . I 'm writing you up a ticket .
KUMAR: A ticket ? ! Are you serious ? Harold motions Kumar to `` shut the fuck up ! ''
OFFICER PALUMBO: Who the fuck are you , shitwad ?
HAROLD: Let me apologize for my friend . I promise I will pay the fine . But actually , I 'm glad you 're here . You know the TV show Doogie Howser , M.D ? You see , Doogie Howser just stole my car and
OFFICER PALUMBO: Pipe down and give me your ID .
KUMAR: Wait . Hold on .
HAROLD: Kumar , shut up
OFFICER PALUMBO: Yeah , that 's not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass .
KUMAR: Bust my ass ? !
OFFICER PALUMBO: Yeah , Koo-mar . Bust your ass . What 's with that name Koo-mar with like three o 's and shit . What happened to good old fashioned American names like Dave , Jim Harold points to his ID .
HAROLD: Harold . Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo .
OFFICER PALUMBO: Yes . Harold . That 's a great name . You should be proud of that name , son .
HAROLD: Thank you .
OFFICER PALUMBO: As you were , ladies .
KUMAR: 220 dollars ! ? Are you crazy ?
HAROLD: Kumar , I swear to God , if you do n't
KUMAR: No , no , no . I understand what 's going on .
OFFICER PALUMBO: Hey , hands down ! No sudden moves !
KUMAR: Let me guess . You were probably the big asshole in your high school , right ? You 'd pick on guys like us every day . But then graduation came , and we went to college and you went nowhere , so you thought , `` How can I still give them shit ? I know ! I 'll become a cop ! '' Well , congratulations . Your dream 's come true .
HAROLD: Oh shit .
OFFICER PALUMBO: Thanks , Mrs. Ogelthorpe . Your donation to our Police Charity is very appreciated .
HIPPIE ASSHOLE: Mom please take me home
HAROLD: Can I at least give you my car 's licence plate number ?
TARIK: For being black .
HAROLD: Come on . Seriously .
TARIK: I am serious . You wan na know what happened ? Harold nods .
HAROLD: Holy shit . What did you do ?
TARIK: I kept saying , `` I understand that I 'm under arrest . Please stop beating me . '' But that did n't work . Then another cop showed up . Then another . When it was all said and done , it took nine cops to ing me in here .
HAROLD: That fucking blows !
TARIK: Son , I 'm fat . I 'm black . I ca n't dance . And I have two gay fathers . I 've had people messing with me my whole life . I learned a long time ago , there 's no point in getting all riled up every time a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time . Because in the end , the universe tends to unfold as it should .
HAROLD: Assaulting an officer .
TARIK: They tried to pin that shit on you too ?
HAROLD: No . I actually did hit the cop . But only because I was trying to hit my friend . Well , ex-friend .
OFFICER REILLY: Hey , listen up guys ! Multiple gun shots fired in Millbrook Park ! It sounds bad !
OFFICER PALUMBO: Finally , some action ! I 'm going ! Another cop , OFFICER MARTONE , gets up
OFFICER MARTONE: No I 'm going !
HAROLD: That was strange .
TARIK: Hey , I 'm trying to read here .
HAROLD: Hey asshole , I 'm in jail ! Do n't bitch to me about your problems ! Just leave me alone . I do n't want your help .
KUMAR: Owmy ass . Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell .
HAROLD: And become a fugitive ? Are you nuts ? The guy has all my information .
KUMAR: So what ? We 'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave . Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow . Harold thinks about this for a second .
HAROLD: Fine . Hurry up .
KUMAR: Yes ! I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys . Now I get to try all of them to see which one will
HAROLD: Kumar , hurry the fuck up !
KUMAR: What 's that smell ?
HAROLD: Kumar ? Kumar !
OFFICER PALUMBO: You thought you could get away with this , huh ?
OFFICER REILLY: Look !
OFFICER PALUMBO: Shit ! Jackson 's trying to escape ! Tarik looks up from his book
TARIK: What ? Oh , not again !
OFFICER PALUMBO: Stop trying to escape !
TARIK: I 'm not trying to escape ! Look at me , I 'm sitting down !
OFFICER REILLY: He 's trying to break free ! Hold him tight !
HAROLD: Wait should n't we do something about this ?
NATHANIEL: If I were you , I 'd get out of here as soon as possible . With that , Harold and Kumar run out
KUMAR: Hurry up !
HAROLD: Jesus Christ ! That place was a fucking mad house ! Thanks for getting me out of there , dude .
KUMAR: Hey , man , the burgers would n't taste as good if you were n't there . Dude , look at this . It 's like we went from being broke to being millionaires .
HAROLD: What was that ?
KUMAR: Just a coyote . Do n't worry .
HAROLD: Are n't people supposed to be scared of coyotes ?
KUMAR: That 's only because they sound scary . In one on one combat , either one of us can take a coyote down .
HAROLD: We 're gon na die .
KUMAR: Just calm down . Cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit . They 're not known for eating humans .
HAROLD: We 're gon na die .
KUMAR: Okay , I 'll admit , that 's not a good sign . But I 'm sure if we just stay calm he 'll probably leave us alone .
HAROLD: This is n't working .
KUMAR: Shhh .
KUMAR: I thought I told you not to take that jerky !
HAROLD: He likes me . Suddenly , Kumar 's eyes light up
KUMAR: Dude , I think I have an idea .
HAROLD: What is it ?
KUMAR: I 'll tell you , but first we have to get eally high . Kumar opens the bag of weed .
HAROLD: Has it come to this ? Are we really gon na ide this cheetah ?
KUMAR: Hey , cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet . It 's as good as a car .
HAROLD: This is either a really smart move , or by far the stupidest thing we 've ever done .
KUMAR: Well , we 'll soon find out . Mush ! Mush !
HAROLD: Dude , am I just really high or is this is actually working ? !
KUMAR: Both !
HAROLD: This is great ! We 'll be at White Castle in no
MARIA: I love you , Harold .
HAROLD: I love you , Maria .
COLE: extremely gay that is .
MARIA: Oh Harold ! Yes ! Yes ! Oh , God you have the biggest dick of all time ! It 's so long ! And wide , for that matter !
HAROLD: What the hell are you doing ? ! ! !
KUMAR: I 'm sorry ! You 've been out cold for the past half-hour ! I figured that maybe if I did some gay shit you 'd wake up .
HAROLD: What happened to the cheetah ?
KUMAR: It ran away . But forget about that . I have some bad news and some worse news .
HAROLD: Tell me the worse news first .
KUMAR: I checked out some road signs . The cheetah took us in the wrong direction .
HAROLD: That sucks . What 's the bad news ?
KUMAR: Your laptop is completely destroyed .
KUMAR: It smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah .
HAROLD: Why the hell did n't you say that THAT was the `` worse news '' ?
KUMAR: Well , the laptop really only effects you . Whereas the White Castle situation effects both of us equally .
HAROLD: Oh no ! No ! No !
KUMAR: Do n't worry , dude . Your laptop 's insured .
HAROLD: It 's not that ! All my work was saved in there ! Now I got ta go back to the office and re-do everything !
KUMAR: Exactly . First , we 'll take a cab over to White Castle , then we 'll
HAROLD: Forget White Castle . There 's no time !
KUMAR: Come on , Rold ! You can get that shit done in a couple hours . We ca n't quit now !
COLE: Who 's running the Quik-E-Mart while you 're gone ? COLE pounds fists with his friends .
KUMAR: Fucking asshole .
HAROLD: Look !
KUMAR: What ? A chocolate cream filled ?

HAROLD: I had to do something . KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air
KUMAR: Wait . Do you smell that ?
HAROLD: This world is so unfair .
KUMAR: Do n't worry . Forget about that . We have a car now . We 're back in the game . Pretty soon we 'll be eating our own White Castle . Want me to drive ?
HAROLD: No . I 've got everything under control . We should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after ou feast . Just find us some tunes .

KUMAR: Dude , it 's okay . I used to hang-glide with my dad all the time when I was kid . I know how to do it .
HAROLD: You hang-glided ? I do n't remember that .
KUMAR: We did it on our trips to India . I swear . I know exactly what I 'm doing . I 've even done it with two people at the same time . My brother and I did it .

OFFICER BRUCKS: It appears they 've escaped . They ditched their jeep .
HAROLD: Dude , we 're so high right now .
KUMAR: We 're not low .

HAROLD: Where 's my fucking car you prick !
NEIL: Yeah . Sorry about that . Like I said , I was tripping balls last night . I do n't know what came over me . Your car 's out in the parking lot . Here are the keys . NEIL tosses HAROLD the car keys .
KUMAR: Do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car ?
NEIL: I know . It was a dick move on my part . That 's why I 'm paying for your meal .
HAROLD: Thanks , I guess . NEIL hands them some cash
NEIL: Here 's fifty for the meal , and two hundred for the car .
HAROLD: What happened to the car ?
NEIL: I made some love stains in the back seat . You 'll see . Anyway , take it easy guys . I 'll see you around .
HAROLD: Where are you going ?
NEIL: Wherever God takes me .
TEENAGER: Hey guysit 's gon na take a little while to make all those burgers . You might as well sit down .

FEMALE ANCHOR: Today 's top storyRutgers professo Tarik Jackson and attorney Nathaniel Banks are suing the state of New Jersey for racial discrimination and police utality . We go live to the municipal state courthouse in Muckleburg

HAROLD: Mine too .
KUMAR: Dude , you know what ? I think I may actually go to my interview today .
HAROLD: Seriously ?
KUMAR: Yeah . You know , my whole life I 've been afraid being just another nerdy Indian guy turned doctor . Well , tonight got me thinking
HAROLD: Uh-huh .
KUMAR: Besides , I have to admit , it felt pretty cool saving that guy 's life last night . Somewhere between that , getting yelled at y my dad , and seeing Neil Patrick Harris , I realized that I 've always wanted to be a doctor I 've just been too scared to admit it .
HAROLD: I 'll be right back
BILLY: I 'll be there in a second
HAROLD: Never mind me . What are you doing here ? I thought you and J.D . were busy all night with `` clients . '' Is n't that why I had to do YOUR work ?
BILLY: Listen Harry
HAROLD: Tell him what ? That I 'm your work horse ! That you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet Asian guy in your office ! Huh ? J.D . is stunned . Now he 's a little nervous .
HAROLD: And I 'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore .
KUMAR: Way to go , Rold ! Where the hell did that come from ?
HAROLD: I do n't know . Eating those delicious urgers made me feel like a new man . Now I 'm actually looking forward to work this week .
KUMAR: No shit ! I guess you 're worthwhile afte all .
HAROLD: I 'm not worthless .
KUMAR: So those dudes have gonorrhea ?
HAROLD: Beats me . Now , come on , let 's get going .
KUMAR: What 's the rush ? There 's plenty of time efore my interview .
HAROLD: I have some unfinished business to take care of .
KUMAR: Good luck , dude .
LUIS: What do you want ?
HAROLD: Ohuhnothingwrong room .
LUIS: Hey , Papi 's coming ! Hold on ! This girl is crazy , man .
HAROLD: Look , I really do n't need to hear it . I guess I just made a mistake . Sorry fo interrupting you guys
LUIS: Hey if you 're looking for Maria , she left for Europe this morning .
HAROLD: Huh ?
LUIS: She 's going to Amsterdam for ten days . I 'm Luis Maria 's brother .
HAROLD: Oh ! Maria 's brother !
LUIS: You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps talking about .
HAROLD: Actually , I 'm Korwait a second she talks about me ?
AISHA: Are you coming or what ?
LUIS: Hey , I 'll be there in a second , baby . Do me a favor make me that omelette you were talking about . You know , with the sun-dried tomatoes .

LUIS: Then take it easy , hermano .
KUMAR: Dudewe got ta go !
HAROLD: Huh ? Where ?
KUMAR: To Amsterdam ! We can pack up right now and take the next plane .
HAROLD: What are you talking about ? Are you out of your mind ? What about your interview with the med school guy ?
KUMAR: Whatever . I 'll tell my dad to reschedule it . He wo n't have a problem , as long as I 'm taking it seriously for a change . Now , let 's fly to Europe and find Maria !
HAROLD: She 's coming back in ten days ! It 's not like I 'm never gon na see her again .
KUMAR: For a hot chick , ten days in Europe is the kiss of death . There are gon na be suave , sophisticated guys all over her . By the time she gets back , she may not be available .
HAROLD: Forget it . I 'll just wait till she comes ack . Harold starts to walk away from Kumar
KUMAR: Hey , Rold ! Wait !
JANE: It 'll take a month to probate the will , Nell ! A month ! Even if Mother left you something , you wo n't get it in time to pay the ent . So instead of complaining , you should be thanking Lou fo getting you these two weeks to get Mother 's things packed .
LOU: You 're still going to have to settle with your mother 's landlord on the back rent .
NELL: I 'm not going to stay . I 'll get a job . I 'll get my own apartment .
JANE: Nell . A job ? Two months and where is this job ? You have no degree , you 've never worked Nell explodes in outraged fury , startling us .
NELL: I 've never worked ?
JANE: You have no experience in the world the regular world . What would you put on a resume ? Now we all appreciate what you did for Mother . Is n't that right , Lou ?
LOU: Eleven years . Long time .
JANE: That 's why we 've been talking . With me getting more time in Accessories , and Lou at the shop all day , we need somebody to take care of Richie , do a little cleaning and cooking . And in eturn you can have the extra oom .
RICHIE: Eleanor , help me ! I 've got to pee !
LOU: Richie , knock it off before I beat the crap out of you ! Nell turns away , sick , breathing hard . Jane picks up a JEWELRY BOX from a dresser .
JANE: You 're sure this is all of Mother 's jewelry ? The lawyer said to make sure we took it to him He said there might be some antique pieces . Have you seen anything ? Some of it might be valuable .
NELL: Hello ? Yes , this is Eleanor . Where ? Yes , it 's right here .
MALCOLM: It 's still an electric shock !
MARROW: Come on Malcolm , it 's only seven ohms , it 's nothing , it 's like a joy buzzer ! And it 's not about the pain , it 's about the interference with concentration
MALCOLM: Stop defending your science afte the fact , Jim . The department protocol for research is very clear about this , and you violated the rules . I know , I know , I know that `` Fear and Performance '' is a ig sexy idea , but as long as I 'm chairman here you will need this department 's endorsement to publish it , and right now I ca n't do that .
MARROW: Malcolm , this is essential work I 'm doing . Just think what my esearch can do for education . Elementary school classrooms nea train tracks or airports , where loud noise is random ; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read .
MALCOLM: And that will be a good place to end this study .
MARROW: No , Malcolm ! Individual performance is only part of it . I know why baseball players choke for no reason , I know why violinists throw up with fea efore every concert , and need to , to give a great performance , but what I want to know is , how fea works in a group
MALCOLM: Not the way you 've constructed your group , it 's just not ethical !
MARROW: But if the group knows it 's being studied as a group , you contaminate the results . The deception is minor . Malcolm sees Mary Lambretta .
MALCOLM: Are you working with her ?
MARROW: Mary , I 'll meet you outside . She understands , and she closes the door .
MALCOLM: Why are you working with her ? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies .
MARROW: And after she was thrown out , she needed a job .
MALCOLM: You do n't believe in the paranormal .
MARROW: No , but she does , and that 's all that matters .
MALCOLM: Does she know that 's why you 're using her ?
MARROW: No .
MALCOLM: I , I just ca n't
MARROW: She needed a job , Malcolm . And she 's smart . And she helps me .
MALCOLM: I have a bad feeling about what you 're doing .
MARROW: This is the last chapter . Please , please give me clearance . It 's for science . Marrow waits .
MALCOLM: I 'm gon na hate myself for this . But he nods . Permission granted .
MARROW: Thank you .
MARY: I see a hostile man he 's . The hostile man does not believe in Madame Velka .
MARROW: What ?
MARY: You 're going to publish , he 's going to perish And why did you hire me for this ?
MARROW: You hear the vibrations in the wire . There 's a magnetic pulse in the wires , you feel it . I could test it .
MARY: Test it . The phone still rings . Marrow answers .
MARROW: Yes , this is Doctor Marrow .
MARY: How 'd I know it was for you ?
MARROW: Because it 's my phone . Yes Mrs. Dudley , just leave the oxes inside , thank you . See you soon . Thank you . He hangs up .
MARY: Here 's how they 're organized . Groups of five , very different personalities scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for . And they all score high on the insomnia charts .
MARROW: Good .
MARY: Her mother died two months ago . She says she really wants to do this . I did n't know if it 'd be taking advantage
MARROW: What a beautiful profile . How do you feel about her ? What does your intuition say ? Mary balks at his teasing .
MARY: I put my favorites on the top . Marrow continues to study the files .
MARROW: That ? That 's Hill House .
MARY: This is where we 're going ?
MARROW: Yes . It 's perfect , is n't it ?
NELL: Hello Baby
MOTHER: Say thank you , Spencer . I was getting her something to drink . She 's been crying all day
NELL: That 's all right .
MOTHER: Of course you know , how many children do you have ?
NELL: None .
MOM: Then you 're a teacher . Nursery school .
NELL: No .
MOM: You just you seem like someone who takes care of children , lots of children .
NELL: Maybe maybe someday . I 'd like that .
MR. DUDLEY: What do you want ?
NELL: Oh ! You scared me .
MR. DUDLEY: Me ? No . What are you doing here ?
NELL: Are you Mister Dudley , the caretaker ?
MR. DUDLEY: Yeah , I 'm Mister Dudley , the caretaker . What are you doing here ?
NELL: I 'm with Dr . Marrow 's group . I 'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house . Is she here ?
MR. DUDLEY: Maybe she is
NELL: Why do you need a chain like that ?
MR. DUDLEY: That 's a good question . What is it about fences ? Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable . Why would that e ?
NELL: Is there something about the house ?
MR. DUDLEY: Mrs. Dudley 'll be waiting for you .
NELL: Hello ? Hello ? Mrs. Dudley ? Mrs. Dudley , are you here ? Anybody ? Tentative , she pushes it open into
MRS. DUDLEY: It 's make the soup or answer the door . Ca n't do both .
NELL: Mrs. Dudley .
MRS. DUDLEY: So far .
NELL: I 'm Eleanor Vance , I 'm with
MRS. DUDLEY: The Purple Room . You 're going to e the first visitors that Hill House has had since Mister Crain died .
NELL: They 're so beautiful . Are n't they ?
MRS. DUDLEY: I 've seen 'em . Lot to dust .
NELL: Well , I 've never lived with eauty . You must love working here .
MRS. DUDLEY: It 's a job . I keep banker 's hours . I set dinner on the dining oom sideboard at six . You can serve yourselves . Breakfast is eady at nine . I do n't wait on people . I do n't stay afte dinner . Not after it begins to get dark . I leave before dark comes . We live in town . Nine miles . So there wo n't be anyone around if you need help . We could n't even hear you , in the night .
NELL: Why would we
MRS. DUDLEY: no one could . No one lives any nearer than town . No one will come any nearer than that . In the night . In the dark .
NELL: Finally .
THEO: You may think I have a sickness about packing , but asking people to help me shlep the stuff I take with me everywhere is a cheap and exploitative way of making new friends . My name 's Theo .
NELL: I 'm Eleanor but everyone calls me Nell . Eleanor Vance . Nell . I 'm eally glad you 're here . Really . Theo is a little thrown by Nell 's gushing . NELL What a beautiful jacket .
THEO: And what you 're wearing , that 's great , too .
NELL: This ? It 's from a thrift shop .
THEO: What did it cost ?
NELL: Fifteen dollars .
THEO: That 'd be seventy in New York . You stole it !
NELL: It 's all I could afford .
THEO: Wait . You 're not wearing that ironically ? This is really you ?
NELL: I do n't know what you mean .
THEO: A week . You and I ? We 're going to have fun .
MRS. DUDLEY: I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six .
NELL: We could n't even hear you .
MRS. DUDLEY: No one could . No one lives any nearer than town .
NELL: No one will come any nearer than that .
MRS. DUDLEY: In the night . In the dark .
THEO: Do n't worry , I probably wo n't be in here much . Light sleeper .
NELL: That 's why we 're here .
THEO: What do you do ?
NELL: I 'm between jobs right now . My last job it the person I was working for the job ended . Over . So And you ?
THEO: That depends .
NELL: Not really .
THEO: Do n't tell me Boston is different from New York .
NELL: Ohh , sure , you have trouble with commitment .
THEO: My boyfriend thinks so , my girlfriend does n't . If we could all live together but they hate each other . It 's hard to be Miss Perversity when you 're the only one at the party . D'you know what I mean ?
NELL: No .
THEO: A blank canvas ! I could paint your portrait , directly on you . Or maybe not . So , you ? Husbands ? Boyfriends ? Girlfriends ? Where do you live ?
NELL: I do n't have anyone . But I do have a little apartment of my own . It has a little flowe garden . You can just see the ocean . At night , when the wind comes in just right , you can hea the buoys in the harbor .
THEO: That sounds really nice . You 're lucky . But you know that .
NELL: So much carving . It 's everywhere . On everything . Theo starts down the hall . Nell follows .
THEO: Maybe you should n't touch
NELL: I know .
THEO: Which one ? Pick any .
NELL: Theo !
THEO: You 're okay .
NELL: We should go back .
LUKE: Hi , Luke Sanderson , bad sleeper , I 'm your basic tosser-turner , and you are
NELL: Uh Nell Vance
LUKE: And what kind of sleeper ?
NELL: Well , I uh
LUKE: Obsessive worrier . Join the club . And you ? I 'd guess
THEO: You 'll never guess . She wo n't answer .
MARROW: There we are . You 're Eleanor , you 're Luke , you 're Theo .
ALL: Hi hello Dr . Marrow
MARROW: And this is Todd , he just came up .
TODD: Hi . I 'm Todd Aubochon .
LUKE: Greetings fellow insomniac .
TODD: Greetings fellow sheep counter .
MARROW: And this is my assistant , Mary Lambretta .
LUKE: Greetings .
MARROW: Eleanor , how was the drive ?
NELL: You can call me Nell , Dr . Marrow .
MARROW: Nell . Good enough . And I 'm Jim .
NELL: I 'm really honored to be part of this study , Jim .
MARROW: Well we 're glad to have you .
THEO: No , but Nell 's been here longe than I have .
NELL: I only saw Theo drive up .
LUKE: Who 's Watts ?
MARROW: The man who completes the group .
TODD: These old Victorian houses are great , are n't they ?
LUKE: ( points to details ;
MARROW: Nobody . A local mill owner , Hugh Crain , built it in 1830 . He had no heirs , but he put the house in trust , and the farmland around it , with the stipulation that it neve e altered or sold . Crain 's executors made good investments and for the last hundred and twenty years , Hill House has taken care of itself .
TODD: So what 's this study all about anyway ? Mary described the kind of tests we 'll be doing , but did n't fill us in on the big picture . She said you needed bad sleepers , but this was n't about curing the problem .
MARY: I can tell you what this is about .
MARROW: Eat first , questions later , Mary , please .
NELL: Is something wrong ?
MARY: No . Just when I saw you picture I had a feeling about you , and now that I meet you , I know I was right .
NELL: What ?
MARY: Eat first , questions later .
LUKE: You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this ?
TODD: What ?
LUKE: Every year is a good year .
MARROW: Theo ? It 's your turn .
THEO: The rest of you may hate you insomnia , but I find it the best time of the day for me . I 'm alone . Nobody 's talking to me but myself . My mind is racing with ideas , and I can think .
LUKE: Nah , you 're going crazy with doubt , all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes , and it 's worse than a nightmare .
MARY: I think I 'd fall asleep easily , ut just as I start to feel comfortable , I see things in the dark . Nell hears this , Nell is tuned into Mary .
NELL: All of you have such interesting problems . There 's laughter . NELL No Please , I know how that sounds but You 're all so articulate . You know how to talk . I feel like I 'm here under false pretenses . It 's silly , it 's not like well , all of you have trouble sleeping because you live in the world , and the world is complicated and scary , but nothing 's ever happened to me . So I do n't have a reason to sleep adly .
MARROW: You wrote that you had trouble sleeping .
NELL: Yes , because someone was always keeping me awake . Ever since I was little . That was my job . I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long , and she woke up all the time . And after she died , well , it 's been a few months , but I still , I still wake up , it 's a habit . I know we 've only known each othe a couple of hours , but I 'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this . I 'm really happy to be here with you .
MARROW: We 're glad you 're here .
MARY: It 's an Erard . Late 1870s .
NELL: What 's wrong ?
MARY: The harp is out of tune .
MARROW: I 'll have to count David Watts as a no-show . So let 's start . Thank you , Mary .
LUKE: So why did you need the Addam 's Family mansion for a scientific test ?
MARROW: I thought it best to be isolated , to be in a location with a definite sense of history , and I wanted to make sure that it was n't so pleasant you 'd all sleep too easily . You 'll be taking a variety of tests , none of them harmful , and you 've got the house , the grounds , and each other to keep you company .
THEO: When do we take the tests ?
MARROW: Every day . Basically we 'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening .
MARY: Dr . Marrow , what is this house ?
NELL: All the carvings .
MARROW: But there 's a sad catch to the story .
MARY: What happened ?
MARROW: There were no children . Rene died , and then Hugh Crain built all of this , and then he died . His heart was broken .
NELL: That 's so sad .
MARY: I think there 's more to the story . This house has its own music , Doctor Marrow , I can play it fo you , I can hear it .
TODD: Oh Jesus .
MARROW: Mary , let me see your eye .
NELL: Here , cover it . Do n't let he touch it .
LUKE: Keep your head back , that 's it . Todd opens his door . Marrow hands him a key .
MARROW: Here 's my key to the gate . Call me the second you know anything .
LUKE: That could have been worse .
MARROW: Yeah . As they turn back , Marrow taps Luke .
LUKE: Sure .
MARROW: Because well , I know I can trust you .
LUKE: Why ?
MARROW: I 've read your tests .
LUKE: I can keep a secret .
THEO: And why did n't Marrow tell us ? Does n't he trust women ? That fuck .
NELL: A monster ? But he built this fo the woman he loved , like the Taj Mahal .
THEO: The Taj Mahal was n't a palace , it was a tomb . Why did n't he tell us ?
LUKE: He 's trying to protect the experiment . Personally , I do n't think he 's got a large enough sample for valid results , but as long as the money 's good , and the food is good , I 'm in .
THEO: Nell , it was an accident .
MARROW: Icebreaker exercise conducted ove dinner . Observed initial bonding among subjects and experimenter . After dinner first bland history of House relayed . Nell appears most susceptible to suggestive history . Luke , who tested at the ottom of the Levy-Mogel Confidence Reliability Scale was given the second part of the story . We should see some results tomorrow . Accident with harp , while unfortunate complements the experimental fiction .
THEO: Ever try putting your hair up in a French twist ?
NELL: Sorry . I 'm not used to being touched .
THEO: You 've been out of the world for a long time , have n't you ?
NELL: Yes . I 've missed it .
THEO: No . The world has missed you .
NELL: Good night , Theo .
THEO: You , too . Happy tossing and turning .
NELL: Coming , Mother !
THEO: What is it ! ?
NELL: No !
THEO: Luke . She grabs for the door and lets Luke in .
NELL: You really did n't hear anything ?
LUKE: Oh , look ! There he goes , ol ' Hugh Crain !
MARROW: Go ahead .
THEO: If this was some sort of joke , I 'm going to kill him .
NELL: You know it was n't a joke , Theo . Marrow watches the exchange closely .
MARROW: The cold sensation . Who felt it first ?
NELL: Theo I think . You 've asked us that three times , Doctor Marrow . What 's going on ?
MARROW: How do you feel about Luke 's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing ? Water hammer , something like that ?
THEO: I did just take a bath . I do n't know .
NELL: Mother always banged on the wall when she needed me . The night she died I heard her , but I pretended I did n't . I was just so sick of it all . And then the anging stopped . And in the morning she was dead . This is the first I 've ever said this to anyone . That was the job I had , Theo , it 's the only job I 've eve known , and I failed . I 'm actually a bad person , Theo . The world does n't need me .
THEO: Oh , Nell . Eleven years . With all due respect to your mother who I 'm sure was a saint , I 'd have called Doctor Kevorkian , if not for her , for me .
NELL: Good night , Theo .
GIRL VOICE: Find us , find us Eleanor. < /i
NELL: Sorry .
MARROW: For an American you do a good imitation of the British at thei most apologetic . Pardon me . Excuse me , sorry , sorry
NELL: Am I that bad ?
THEO: Well this is a cozy breakfast .
MARROW: Good morning , Theo . Luke .
LUKE: After I went to bed , the second time , after the noise I had the best night 's sleep of my life . Anybody ?
NELL: Yes . I feel realy rested , too . Theo ?
THEO: I guess . Oh , your hair ! It looks good .
MARROW: Eat your breakfast , Theo , then we 'll get started on the tests .
NELL: The children . The children Hugh Crain built the house for . The children he never had .
LUKE: Come on . These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist .
NELL: Could n't get the last ones . You ?
LUKE: I did okay . Nell looks at the test , tries to digest this . LUKE We could do this stuff anywhere . I do n't know what he 's up to yet . But like I said , that 's the fun . It has something to do with this environment . Luke just smiles , rises . We 'll see .
NELL: There 's someone in there ! There 's someone in there in the fireplace !
LUKE: Who drives a Toyota ?
THEO: Maybe they 're Mary 's .
MARROW: Mary came with me .
NELL: When I first got here I saw a gray car pull up . I thought it was one of us .
MARROW: And those are Luke 's and mine .
LUKE: There 's a carriage house around ack .
THEO: He must have left . Did n't like the looks of the place o something .
NELL: How could he have left without his keys ?
THEO: Two sets . I do n't know . Maybe they 're not even his .
LUKE: Then he 's got to be in the house
MARROW: Watts !
LUKE: Watts ! Oh Watts ! Here Wattsy
MARROW: Watts ! Can you hear us ?
THEO: Watts ?
NELL: What 's his first name ?
THEO: David .
NELL: David ? David Watts ? Can you hea us ? David ! Daviiiiid !
MARROW: Do you know who these keys belong to ?
MRS. DUDLEY: No .
MARROW: I was expecting another guest yesterday . A man , David Watts . Did you see him ?
MRS. DUDLEY: No .
MARROW: Is your husband around ? I 'd like to
NELL: David ?
THEO: Maybe he never came in . If he 'd come in , he would have left his ags at the door , right ? Or maybe he got here early , and went for a walk , and fell . Maybe he 's outside .
NELL: No , it 's getting worse .
MARROW: Nell ! What 's wrong ?
NELL: That smell oh , God .
MARROW: What did it smell like ?
NELL: It was very specific .
MARROW: All right
NELL: In the bathroom in my mother 's oom , the toilet was next to an old wooden table . It smelled like that wood .
MARROW: So smell is Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories . And a memory can trigger a smell .
NELL: I was n't thinking about my mother 's bathroom .
MARROW: What happened after you smelled it ?
NELL: I looked at Theo . She had a look on her face .
MARROW: Like she smelled it too ?
NELL: Yes .
MARROW: And then what happened ?
NELL: I got more scared . Marrow thinks about this .
MARROW: Hmm .
NELL: I 'm sorry . I 'm messing up the study .
MARROW: No you 're not . Something moved you . You saw something .
NELL: I do n't know . Maybe I
MARROW: I really have n't either .
NELL: My name .
LUKE: It 's somebody 's idea of a joke . She looks at all three of them .
NELL: Who did this ? Why are you doing this ? I do n't know any of you . You do n't know me . Why are you doing this to me ?
LUKE: I did n't do it .
THEO: You could have .
LUKE: So could you ! Is this some fucked up idea of art , putting someone else 's name to a painting ?
THEO: No .
NELL: Theo Did you ?
THEO: Maybe you did it yourself .
NELL: Why ?
THEO: I do n't know . You 've been alone for a long time , maybe you want attention . Maybe he did it
MARROW: I did n't . You know that , Nell .
NELL: I do n't know anything . Whoeve did this , please , just just say so just please this is cruel . Do n't be cruel to me . I ca n't stand it . You do n't know me . And she runs out . Nell grabs for the door to leave .
MARROW: I wish I were . I wish I had done it , then I could confess and you 'd e at peace . That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved , I wish you had an enemy , so I could beat him up . She smiles .
NELL: Let 's say it was n't you . Who did it ?
MARROW: I do n't know .
NELL: It was a stupid thing to do .
MARROW: It was .
NELL: Welcome Home .
MARROW: You 'll never see it again . Mr. Dudley 's taking care of it . I 'm sorry , Nell . Can I show you something you 'd like to see ?
NELL: Sure .
MR. DUDLEY: That 's where she hanged herself .
NELL: Who ?
MR. DUDLEY: Rene Crain . Up there . Rope . Ship 's hawser . Hard to tie . Do n't know how she got it .
MARROW: That 's enough , Mister Dudley .
MR. DUDLEY: She stepped off the platform . They had long skirts in those days .
MARROW: Thank you , Mister Dudley , please
MR. DUDLEY: House is full of stories . If you know how to read these things , it 's an open book . Just a different library than the kind you 're used to .
NELL: Why ?
MR. DUDLEY: Why 'd she kill herself ?
NELL: Yes .
MR. DUDLEY: She was unhappy .
NELL: Why ?
MR. DUDLEY: Ca n't say . Have n't been here that long . Well , it 's Labor Day , got ta get to work . And off he goes .
MARROW: That 's a horrible story . Nell looks up , and smiles . MARROW You 're smiling .
NELL: I was just thinking how happy I am ight now . All my life , I 've been waiting for an adventure . And I thought , oh , I 'll never have that , adventures are for people who travel long distances , that 's fo soldiers , that 's for the women that the bullfighters fall in love with . And here I am , and something is happening to me . Strange noises in the night . Paintings are calling to me . And all it cost to get there was five gallons of gas . I 'm getting my adventure .
MARROW: Someone is playing with you .
NELL: Why ?
MARROW: I do n't know .
NELL: It does n't matter . Even if they 're tormenting me , someone wants me . What I do with this is up to me . I can be a victim , or I can be a volunteer . And I want to e the volunteer .
MARROW: What is that tune ?
NELL: I do n't know . A lullaby I guess . My mother used to hum it to me . And her mother before that , and so on . Hugh Crain , would you care to dance ?
THEO: That 's so sad .
NELL: There 's hundreds of them . This must be a record of the children who died at the mills , like Luke said .
THEO: Before he painted your name ove Mister Crain .
NELL: You really think it was Luke ?
THEO: Well , it was n't me . Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he 's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work fo himself and You said the Good Doctor was with you .
NELL: I do n't know what to think anymore .
THEO: Just think about one thing right now What color ?
NELL: I 've never had a pedicure before .
THEO: Well ?
NELL: Red . What else ?
THEO: Me too . Although I learned one thing about you , that you do n't know about yourself . You can be a pretty decent bitch .
NELL: I 'll take that as a compliment . In the city , what kind of place do you live in ?
THEO: I have a loft . Nell is thrilled with this .
NELL: A loft . That 's a lot of room fo one person . Probably . Maybe there 's room for Theo looks up , understands what she 's asking .
THEO: You want to move to New York , you want to move in with me ?
NELL: I do n't know , you know
THEO: My place is n't like yours , Nell , it does n't have a view of sea . It does n't have a view of anything . What 's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls . Living with me My oundaries are n't very well defined , Nell . Do you know what I mean ?
NELL: I 'm trying . Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it 'd ruin things . Theo looks up at her , unreadable .
THEO: All the time .
NELL: I think so .
THEO: Okay .
NELL: Who is doing this to me ?
THEO: Oh , God , your breath
NELL: HELP !
THEO: Marrow said the same thing as last night , he says that he checked with Mrs. Dudley . And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney . He says that he thinks that the flue was open , and with the windstorm , he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current
NELL: What do you think ? Theo considers , then looks at her , severe .
LUKE: Do n't tell the Professor ; he 'd probably throw me out . But test taking is one of the ways I 've een supporting myself . I volunteer for every paid study that they offer . Of course straight psych stuff does n't pay as much as the pharmaceuticals do , or a good wound study . Check it out .
THEO: Mister very talky , would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you ?
LUKE: The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection . Like he says it 's about one thing , a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia and that 'd be a legitimate study , but I think that we 've been subjected to an academic bait and switch ; he 's eally looking at something else .
NELL: No . No Jim 's not doing these things .
THEO: Then who is ? Come on , Nell . Deep down , if you really thought it was n't Jim , why would n't you be leaving right this second ? Why would n't you be afraid ? Really afraid .
NELL: Because I do n't want to ruin things . Because home is where the heart is .
MARROW: Get a blanket !
THEO: It 's okay we 're all here
MARROW: She 's in shock . Come on .
NELL: After Rene after she killed herself he turned into a monster . He did fill the house with children he did , but they were n't laughing
THEO: Nell , what happened ?
NELL: Carolyn showed me where she hid him , hid him with all the ones he killed
MARROW: Nell please , Nell take a deep breath
NELL: And they 're all locked together in here and he wo n't let go of them ! Marrow grabs her face .
MARROW: Nell !
NELL: Hugh Crain . He 's in the house . He 's still here
THEO: No .
MARROW: Theo ! You too . Listen to me .
LUKE: Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations . You brought us here to scare us . Insomnia , that was just a decoy issue . You 're disgusting .
NELL: Is this true ? I 've been hypnotized ?
MARROW: I had n't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance . Mass hysteria is like a story , Nell . A communal story . Someone starts it . Then we all add a little more to it . And then for some reason no one knows how we start believing it . This story shapes what we see and hear . We interpret everything through it , make it fit the story . I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House . You 've added to it . That 's what this experiment has all been about . That 's what it was about , the experiment 's over . I 'm pulling the plug . This is my fault .
NELL: It 's not real ? Crain ? He 's not eal ? Marrow shoots him a look shut up .
MARROW: Your fear of him was real . That 's all the ghost anyone needs .
THEO: How could you do this to people ? Nell bucks in his arms , furious , desperate .
NELL: This is real , I 'm not making it up ! Theo , you saw it ! You were there the banging and last night . You , you all saw the painting !
THEO: Nell , it makes sense . It all makes sense . You and I , we were scaring each other , working each other up .
NELL: but the painting !
MARROW: Why would we want to do that , Nell ?
NELL: Because that 's where he burned them up , the child laborers from his mills ! Because that 's where their bones are ! He killed i > hundreds . He took them here and he killed them . Their bones are in the fireplace !
MARROW: There are no bones in the fireplace . Luke and I looked in it yesterday . There 's some old charred wood in the ash drop ut
NELL: Oh , God , you 're not going to look
THEO: Aw , shhh Nell , shhh .
MARROW: There has to be Monster in the Labyrinth . We make them up . That 's how we deal with the things in everyday life that are too terrible to deal with . Like losing someone . Like being alone .
LUKE: Sometimes saying you 're sorry is just not enough . A disgusted Luke leaves the room .
NELL: Do n't leave me . Theo spreads an extra blanket over Nell .
THEO: I 'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep . And then I 'm going to get some brandy .
NELL: I do n't think I want any .
THEO: I do .
MARROW: I gave my key to the gate to Todd , ut the Dudleys 'll be here in the morning .
LUKE: Do we still get paid for the week ?
MARROW: You get your money . Awkward silence . MARROW Where did she come up with it ? How did she put it all together ?
LUKE: Is that the question of compassion or science ?
MARROW: It 's a question .
LUKE: She got the child labor stuff from me .
THEO: I I was playing games with her Big city games I was ad . And you , Doctor Morrow , you oke her heart . He knows this . It tears him apart .
MARROW: Is she asleep ?
THEO: Yes . But I promised I would n't let her alone the whole night . Marrow nods , gets his briefcase , exits .
MARROW: Shit . Hello ? Yes , this is Dr . Marrow . Oh , hello . Thank you fo eturning the call . No . You mean he has n't returned ? No , we have n't seen him . Can you tell me , what sort of ca does he drive ? A Toyota
THEO: We 're fucked . We 're in a haunted house and we ca n't get out until the morning .
LUKE: You do n't really believe it 's haunted Do you believe in ghosts ?
THEO: That depends on your definition of ghosts . I 'm going to check on her , and then I 'm going to stay awake .
LUKE: All night ?
THEO: Yeah .
LUKE: You want company ?
THEO: Maybe someday . Some sexual awareness .
NELL: Theo Nell reaches out under the covers . Her HAND is suddenly grasped .
THEO: Nell ?
NELL: Why do you want me ?
MARROW: Nell ! Do n't move .
LUKE: It 's not going to hold you weight .
MARROW: Just stay there , Nell !
LUKE: Do n't !
MARROW: Nell ? Are you up there ?
THEO: Nell , go with him ! Just go with him .
NELL: The children want me . They 're calling me . They need me .
MARROW: Nell . You will come here now . Nell looks UP at him , hazy .
NELL: NO !
MARROW: We 're going down the stairs , Nell , I 'm taking you down the stairs . He leads her go down the stairs .
THEO: She needs help .
MARROW: I 'll take her with me to the University tomorrow . I ca n't elieve I read the test wrong . I did n't see anything that looked like she was suicidal .
LUKE: You used the wrong test .
THEO: Will the two of you shut up ! God damn it ! Maybe the tests were ight , Marrow . She 's sensitive , she 's vulnerable , but I do n't think she 's suicidal and I did n't have to test her . Maybe she was n't trying to kill herself . Maybe she was really scared . Maybe she really heard voices .
LUKE: You 're not telling us something .
MARROW: Watts . Those were his keys Nell found . His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to . I think he 's here .
THEO: He 's wandering around the house , and Nell heard him . She thought it was ghosts . Let 's go look fo him again .
MARROW: No . If he 's lost somewhere in the house he 'll have to stay lost until tomorrow , until the night is over . What we have to do now is e together , with Nell . And they go . Three scared people .
LUKE: Oh my God
MARROW: What is it ?
THEO: Oh , Jesus .
MARROW: Wait a second ! Wait !
LUKE: No .
NELL: They 're all in here . All the ones he killed . They 're just children ! We have to help them !
THEO: Come on ! Why are we waiting ?
MARROW: You okay ?
NELL: Why did you bring me here ?
MARROW: Nell , what are you talking about ? I never called you .
NELL: But you told me to look in the paper ! You told me I 'd be perfect !
MARROW: Nell , the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here .
NELL: Then who called me ?
THEO: Nell
LUKE: how much is this car worth ?
THEO: Hurry . The gas ! Luke The gas !
LUKE: I 'm okay . Okay . Just my chest . Just my wind knocked out .
MARROW: Oh , no .
THEO: I 'm sure she went back to he oom .
LUKE: Where in the hell can she be . Marrow remembers .
MARROW: Oh no
THEO: Nell ?
MARROW: Oh my God it 's Watts .
THEO: Nell !
LUKE: We ca n't stay here looking fo her . She does n't want to be found
THEO: Nell ?
MARROW: Nell .
THEO: What 'd you come back for , babe ?
NELL: Just had to be sure .
LUKE: Come on , Jesus ! Let 's go !
THEO: Let 's go , hon . Do n't you want to go back to your little apartment where you can hear the buoy out in the harbor when the wind is just ight ?
NELL: Oh , Theo . You know I do n't have an apartment .
THEO: Then let 's go get you one .
NELL: Do n't worry about me , Theo . I 'm wanted . Right here . I 'm home .
MARROW: No .
NELL: My mother used to hum this to me . Like her mother hummed it to her . And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her .
MARROW: Come on .
NELL: No
THEO: Please , Nell , just see us out .
NELL: In the night
LUKE: No you bastard ! Break ! He roundhouse kicks it , hurts himself .
NELL: It 's not safe for you anymore . The children need me , and Crain is doing everything he can to keep me from them .
MARROW: Come on .
LUKE: Watch out !
THEO: Hurry !
MARROW: They do n't open !
NELL: Give me your shoelace .
MARROW: What 'll happen to us , Nell ?
NELL: Nothing , if you leave right now . There 's a war going on all around us . Do n't get in the way , please .
LUKE: Shit ! All right , you sonofabitch
MARROW: Luke !
LUKE: What ?
NELL: No ! No ! Let them go !
MARROW: Luke .
THEO: Oh God , we ca n't get out !
MARROW: Nell , what do we do ?
NELL: He played hide and seek with the children . That 's how he built the house .
MARROW: We ca n't hide in here ! We wo n't make it til morning .
NELL: I know .
THEO: Nell ! There you
NELL: Nooo , not them ! What is coming at them makes the blood stop .
THEO: NELL !
MRS. DUDLEY: City people .
MR. DUDLEY: You find out what you wanted to know , mister ?
THEO: I 'm not going back to New York City . I 'm going to find an apartment with a little flowe garden , where you can just see the ocean and at night , when the wind comes in just right , you can hea the sound of the harbor . What about you ?
MARROW: I 'm a scientist . I just conducted an experiment . Now I have to write it up .
THEO: But the experiment was a failure . Now , we could have him say this line
MARROW: Was it ?
MRS. DUDLEY: City people .
MR. DUDLEY: You find out what you wanted to know , mister ?
MARROW: In a way .
THEO: Nell ? Nell ?
LITTLE GIRL: Why did you do that ?
LITTLE BOY: Because you smell like dog poo .
LITTLE GIRL: Made . Of . Dog . Poo .
MOM: Honey , do you know why that little boy did those things ? And said those things ?
ROOMMATE #1: That Phi Delt so obviously liked you . I 'm sure he just lost your number .
SECRETARY: He 's not asking you out because he 's intimidated by your professional success and emotional maturity .
CASHIER #1: Trust me . It 's because he 's just getting out of a serious relationship .
GIGI: So , Janine told me you 're a real estate agent .
CONOR: Yeah . But do n't worry - not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus enches and grocery carts .
GIGI: So just like on frisbees and notepads ?
CONOR: You got it .
GIGI: Much classier .
CONOR: My thoughts exactly .
GIGI: I wonder why Janine never thought of introducing us before ?
CONOR: Yeah , I do n't know , I ummm -
WAITRESS: You guys ready for another round ?
CONOR: You want one more ?
GIGI: Only if you do . But I mean , if you have to get going I totally
CONOR: Umm . OK. Sure . One more .
GIGI: Well , Conor , I had a really nice time .
CONOR: Yeah . It was really nice meeting you .
GIGI: B-bye .
CONOR: Hey , it 's meI just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you .
ANNA: Conor , that 's so nice . Thank you .
BEN: Do you want to go ahead ?
ANNA: Hmm ?
BEN: Go ahead ? You 've only got two things .
ANNA: Hold on .
BEN: Well , technically it 's six . And I 'm still mulling over a gum purchase . So
ANNA: Hey , let me call you right back .
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER: Oh my word .
ANNA: Come on . Seriously . I just deposited money today . There 's no way -
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER: It 's not that . Let me check something .
CONT'D: Congratulations . You won .
ANNA: What ?
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER: Our `` Sizzlin ' Summer '' promotion . You 're our 1000th customer in June .
ANNA: Are you kidding ?
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER: Do I have that kind of manner ? A joking manner ?
ANNA: I swear to god , this is the most exciting thing that 's ever happened to me .
BEN: Really ?
ANNA: Is that sad ?
BEN: No , it 's - charming . Congratulations .
ANNA: Wait , no . I ca n't accept this . You were here first . I did n't win at all .
BEN: Yes , you did . Trust me - it 's fate . You were meant to have that cooler .
ANNA: Thank you SO MUCH .
ALEX: Hey . How was the date ?
CONOR: Fine . You know .
ALEX: My cable 's out .
CONOR: You did n't hear the phone ring , did you ?
ALEX: Nope .
CONOR: Shit . Anna gave me the `` I 'll call you ight back . ''
ALEX: How long ago ?
CONOR: 22 minutes .
ALEX: Sorry , dude .
CONOR: Do I call back ?
ALEX: At 9 30 PM ? Genius .
CONOR: It is genius . Because then I can say `` In case you were going to call me back - do n't - 'cause I 'll be sleeping . ''
ALEX: Sounds foolproof .
ANNA: Sorry . What was I saying ?
BEN: I think you were telling me how you do n't want to be like your mom and wake up and ealize you did n't pursue your dreams .
ANNA: Was I ? Little intense for grocery store chatter . Sorry .
BEN: It 's OK . I might even be able to help you out . There 's a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients .
ANNA: That would be - amazing . What are you - like my savior ?
BEN: OK. Look . I 'm married . I do n't do this .
ANNA: Do n't do what ? Help struggling singers ?
BEN: Help hot Pilates instructing singers who happen to be very charming .
ANNA: Do you want to give me your card ? That 's legit . I bet you 're allowed to do that .
BEN: Right . OK . I guess that would be OK .
NEIL: So , who was that ?
BEN: A prospective client .
NEIL: Yeah right .
BEN: I can talk to a woman Neil . It does n't have to be like that .
NEIL: Hey , babe . You here ?
BETH: Hey honey .
NEIL: Everything OK ?
BETH: Yeah . Just got off the phone .
NEIL: You want some tea or something ?
BETH: It was my baby sister . She 's getting married .
NEIL: That 's great . I 've always liked that Devon guy . That 's really great .
BETH: Do you think it 's great ?
NEIL: Yeah .
BETH: So , you think it 's great that they 're getting married , but you never feel like we 're going against nature or something y not getting married ?
NEIL: No , babe .
BETH: Right .
NEIL: I actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married . Look at my parents - all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking .
BETH: Yeah , I know . I get that .
NEIL: Like I 've always told you - I love you - and we do n't need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship .
BETH: Yeah .
NEIL: Lem me get you some tea .
JANINE: OK , so clearly he has n't called .
GIGI: He sells real estate . In Baltimore . Staying in town is his business .
JANINE: Right .
GIGI: Really ?
JANINE: Yes , really .
GIGI: This is all your fault .
JANINE: What ? Why ?
GIGI: You set me up with him .
JANINE: No - you asked if I knew any guys and I gave Conor your number . That 's not a set up . When I do a set up - I weigh pros and cons . I do my due diligence . All I know about Conor is he sold us this house .
GIGI: He sold you a house in the ghetto .
JANINE: It 's a neighborhood `` in transition . ''
GIGI: He said he always hangs at Red Maple after work . Maybe I should do a little drive-by ?
JANINE: Please , do n't . He 'll call .
AMBER: Caller ID was the worst thing that 's eve happened to me . Total invasion of my personal freedom . When a guy does n't call me , it is my right - my duty even - to call him and hang up several thousand times . Or at least until his mothe shouts at me in Albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone . I mean , calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers - and who is AT & f'ing T to take that away from me ?
GIGI: Mom , I got ta call you back .
JANINE: So , this was at the end of the date , o at the beginning ?
GIGI: End . Why - does it matter ?
JANINE: Yeah . `` Nice meeting you '' at the beginning of the date is normal . `` Nice meeting you '' at the end could be a blow off .
GIGI: Maybe it was at the beginning .
JANINE: Then that 's fine . He 's gon na call .
GIGI: Or maybe it was at the end . Or maybe it was nice to meet me .
JANINE: Wait - was it `` nice meeting you '' or `` nice to meet you '' ?
GIGI: Shit . I ca n't remember .
JANINE: `` Nice to meet you '' is OK. `` Nice meeting you '' is like `` Do you want your receipt in the bag ? ''
BETH: Remember the days when you guys at least pretended to be working when I came in ?
JANINE: Beckon the baking to begin ! McCormick , the flavor expert , introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely delight dessert divas !
BETH: Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration - ut otherwise good . Where are we with the company newsletter ?
GIGI: I am so almost done with that . It 's just een a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in market esearch , when the guy - who may or may not be the guy of my dreams - refuses to call me .
BETH: Look , after my first date with Neil , I called him . There are no rules anymore . Why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass ?
GIGI: It 's ringing .
JANINE: Pretty standard .
GIGI: Yes ! Voicemail .
JANINE: Your notes .
GIGI: Hey , Conor . It 's Gigi . I just thought , I had n't heard from you and , I mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy 's call anyway , right ?
JANINE: Do n't worry . He 's totally gon na call .
GIGI: WHAT ? How can there be no dial tone ?
KELLI ANN: Knock knock .
ALEX: Hey .
KELLI ANN: So . Here we are . Same shift again .
ALEX: I know . I make the schedule .
FLIRTING: I figured it was no coincidence .
ALEX: Yeah . It 's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you .
KELLI ANN: Anyway - I was thinking , maybe tonight after workwe could , you know
ALEX: Look , Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun . But we 're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that 's why I scheduled you . To work . So
KELLI ANN: No . We 're good .
TYRONE: Dude .
ALEX: I know .
KELLI ANN: Are you joining us for dinner or -
GIGI: I 'm meeting someone . A guy .
KELLI ANN: Ugh . Why ?
GIGI: Hmmmm ?
KELLI ANN: Nothing . Sorry . For dinner ?
GIGI: I 'm meeting someone .
KELLI ANN: I believe you mentioned that .
GIGI: I 'm gon na wait at the bar .
KELLI ANN: That 's a great idea .
ALEX: What can I get you ?
GIGI: Oh , that 's OK . I 'm meeting someone .
ALEX: Oh , yeah ? Got a hot date ?
GIGI: I do n't know if you 'd call it hot I mean this guy Conor and I have only been out the one time so
ALEX: Wait - Conor Barry ?
GIGI: Oh , uhh , yeah
ALEX: Conor 's not coming in tonight . Did he forget he was supposed to meet you ?
GIGI: See when I said `` meeting someone '' I guess that was kind of a broad term , kind of a wide interpretation of the word `` meeting '' -
ALEX: Because I could just call him
GIGI: NO ! I mean , totally unnecessary . I mean , I actually was just - in the area - so I figured I 'd just swing by and see if he was around - because - uhhh -
ALEX: Dr. Frankel - Adult , Child and Geriatric Dentistry .
GIGI: Look , I 'm not gon na judge about what may or may not be important to someone .
ALEX: That 's not even his dentist .
GIGI: Oh , really ? Then who 's his dentist ?
ALEX: My dad .
GIGI: I 'm Gigi . Conor and I went out last week . And I justI thought if I ran into himI do n't know . I 'm gon na go .
ALEX: Hey . Just - hang out for a second . Lem me buy you a drink .
GIGI: Oh really ? How do you know ?
ALEX: Because I 'm a guy . It 's how we do it .
HOPEFUL: He said it was nice meeting me .
ALEX: I do n't care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham . Over a week went by - and he did n't call .
GIGI: But maybe he called me and I did n't get the message . Or maybe he lost my number , or was out of town , or was hit by a cab , or his grandma died .
ALEX: Or maybe he just did n't call because he has no interest in seeing you again .
GIGI: Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a yea later she ran into him
ALEX: Your friend Terri 's an idiot . And she 's the exception .
GIGI: OK . But what if I 'm the exception ?
ALEX: You 're not . You 're the rule . And the ule is - if a guy does n't call you , he does n't want to call you .
GIGI: Really ? Always ?
ALEX: Yeah . Always . I know what blowing off a woman looks like . I do it early and I do it often . Trust me - if a guy is treating you like he does n't give a shit - - he does n't . No exceptions .
GIGI: Why are you telling me all of this ? Are n't these man-secrets - like why men need to watch televised golf ?
ALEX: I do n't know . You looked like you could eally use the help .
GIGI: Thank you . You 've given me a lot to think about .
JANINE: Everything OK ?
GIGI: I was up all night .
JANINE: Please say you were working on the newsletter .
GIGI: Sure . It 's basically done . But this is important .
JANINE: What 's happening with your hair ?
BETH: Please come in my office before the others see that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair .
GIGI: I think I figured it out . Remember when I went out with that notary public ? And he cheated on me ? And then Anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the eginning - but then he totally changed and they 're married and crazy in love .
BETH: I thought that guy was a process server .
GIGI: No , notary . Anyway , the point is - Anastasia is the exception . Not the ule . We have to stop listening to these stories - because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front do n't eally care about you very much .
BETH: Okay
GIGI: Exhibit A Chad , the drummer who lived in his storage space . He only used me for rides , yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998 . Then there was Don , who broke up with me every Friday so he could have his weekends free . I was so delusional about our relationship that I eferred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist .
BETH: OK . So let me see if I understand . What you 're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years , and then he finally married her that 's the exception . And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls - like me - for seven years without getting married - are neve getting married .
GIGI: No . No , no , no . That 's not what I 'm saying . This has absolutely nothing to do with you . I was just talking , you know , about me . Specifically .
ANNA: It is impossible not to like this guy . I 'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside Eddie 's , and then he tells me he 's married . You 'd think I 'd e pissed , but I literally could not stop myself from liking him .
MARY: But he 's married .
ANNA: I realize that . I keep trying to force myself to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman , and even that does n't cool it off . What is my problem ?
MARY: OK . There was this guy who worked in my dad 's printing business . Married fo fifteen years to a nice lady . And then he meets this woman at some church event . And he told my dad he just had never felt anything like it before . I mean , he had finally met the love of his life . So , he divorced his wife , and he 's been with this other woman for 22 years and they are blissfully happy . I mean , what if you meet the love of your life - but you already married someone else ? Are you supposed to pass them by ?
ANNA: You 're right . I 'm calling him .
CONOR: I am so psyched that you called .
ANNA: Cool .
CONOR: I had sort of given up on you when you did n't call me back the other night .
ANNA: Well , you know . I was just thinking about you .
CONOR: OK. Give me the categories again .
ANNA: There are four . Sexy , smart , funny o cute . And each person can only be two . Like Sarah Jessica Parker is funny and sexy . Or Bill Clinton is sexy and smart .
CONOR: I love that you are hot for Clinton .
ANNA: So , which am I ?
CONOR: What was I again ?
ANNA: Smart and cute .
CONOR: OK. You 're sexy . Very sexy . And cute .
ANNA: No . Cute and sexy are in the looks column . No one wants to be in all one column .
CONOR: Well , I sound like a jackass if I say you 're all four . But you 're so obviously all four . Especially sexy .
ANNA: You 're the best .
CONOR: Oh . OK . I mean , you could just stay here tonight .
ANNA: I know . It 's just - I 'm fried . Is that alright ?
CONOR: Sure . Of course .
NEIL: Hey babe , is this straight ?
BETH: Why are you hanging that ?
NEIL: I told you I 'd do it weeks ago . You do n't like it there ?
BETH: I love it there . But just - stop .
NEIL: It 's the image , is n't it ? I did n't see it before , but - you 're right - it totally looks like a sagging boob .
BETH: No . I want you stop doing anything nice .
NEIL: Is this a trick ?
BETH: No . I need you to stop being nice to me - unless you 're gon na marry me after .
NEIL: No . It was just - I was just
BETH: See , you ca n't keep being nice to me and I ca n't keep pretending like this is something that it 's not . We 've been together over seven years . You know me . You either want to marry me or you do n't .
NEIL: Or there is the possibility that I just do n't really believe in the concept of -
BETH: BULLSHIT ! BULLSHIT ! Bullshit for every woman who 's been told by some guy that he does n't believe in marriage just to see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four year old girl he met at the gym . Bullshit .
NEIL: Honey , where is all this coming from ?
BETH: From the place that I have been hiding from you for the last five years because I did n't want to seem demanding , o clingy or psycho or whatever . So I neve ask . But now I 'm going to -
AMY: I was with Damon for six years . He asked me to marry him on the phone , because he 's just so different and cool like that . Said he 'd eventually get me a ing , which he did n't , but he did buy himself a ring because is n't that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the ring ? Then , my favorite part is , I stayed with him even after he took ack his proposal , and introduced the idea of a `` relation vacation . '' Is n't that a cute name ? Let me explain the concept it involves dating a girl from the time she 's thirty two to the time she 's thirty nine , possibly robbing he of the ability to bear children , and then , after all that , wanting to take a year off . And giving it a fun name that you can put on t-shirts . I left him .
BEN: Hey , Anna . This is Ben . Look , I know it 's been a little while since you called . I just - it took me by surprise . But I offered to help you with you career , and I do n't see why I ca n't do that , right ? So , give me a call . Maybe you can come by the office this week o something . Okay , take care . Bye .
JANINE: Hey , how
BEN: Shit - you scared me .
JANINE: Is everything OK ?
BEN: Yeah . Everything 's fine . Why ?
JANINE: Are you smoking again ?
BEN: No , sweetie . Why ?
JANINE: Well - you get jumpy when you smoke .
BEN: I 'm not smoking . So , why do n't we worry about what color we 're gon na paint this oom , instead of worrying about things that are n't happening ?
JANINE: I do n't know - I was thinking maybe - pink ?
BEN: Pink ? Seriously ?
JANINE: Well , I mean , at some point .
BEN: You sure we 're ready for this now ?
JANINE: No . But I mean , we could paint one room pink and one blue just in case .
BEN: You 've already created the perfect family in this house , and we do n't even have drywall .
JANINE: I 'm sorry . I know I promised we 'd wait to talk about it -
BEN: I think we 're almost ready to start talking about it .
JANINE: I 've always liked the name Gisele .
JARRAD: Well , ladies , I guess I have to get back to the office .
GIGI: You go back to the office after happy hour ? What 's happy about that ?
JARRAD: I met you .
GIGI: Of course .
JARRAD: And here 's my info .
GIGI: So , wait how are we doing this ? Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call ?
JARRAD: What ?
GIGI: You said you 'd love to call me , but then you said `` look forward to hearing from you . '' See how that 's kinda confusing ?
JARRAD: Look - we 'll talk . We 'll get in touch .
GIGI: Ooopsie - you did it again . Very vague . You know what ? Why do n't we just say that you 'll call me , and then we can skip all the nonsense .
JARRAD: Goodbye , Gigi .
GIGI: He was cute .
JANINE: Please do n't cyber-stalk him .
GIGI: I 'm not calling him . If he wants to see me - he 'll call .
JANINE: Wow , that guy Alex really made an impression on you . Was he hot ?
GIGI: No . He was just right .
BRUCE: So ?
MARY: He asked me out .
NATHAN: Oh my god ! He called ?
MARY: Well -
JOSHUA: He emailed ?
MARY: Umm -
BRUCE: What ? Did he travel by carriage and leave his calling card with your lady in waiting ?
MARY: He MySpaced me .
NATHAN: Ouch .
JOSHUA: I do n't know . My slutty sister says MySpace is the new booty call .
MARY: Well , what am I supposed to do ? Things have changed . People do n't just meet organically anymore . If I want to make myself more attractive to the opposite sex , I do n't go get a new haircut - I update my profile . That 's just how it is .
CONOR: Hey , it 's Conor . Anna 's - uh - friend . Or whatever .
MARY: Hey . So , did you see it ?
CONOR: I 'm not sure about this .
MARY: You got ta trust me . It 's a burgeoning market . You 're gon na make a fortune .
CONOR: Yeah . I hope so . But , like - did you have to put me on the page with the massage ads ?
MARY: It was either that or on the page with the personals . I made a call .
CONOR: OK. You 're right . Hey , have you talked to Anna lately ?
CATHERINE: I do not understand how you got mom to sew all of these in two weeks .
PAIGE: She wanted to do it .
LAURA: Mom told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweatshop .
PAIGE: No , she did n't .
BETH: Why again do you need to get married so fast ?
CATHERINE: You 're so pregnant .
PAIGE: I 'm not pregnant .
CATHERINE: Chug a beer , then . I want to see you chug a beer .
PAIGE: We 're in love , you assholes . That 's what people do when they 're in love - they get married .
BETH: It 's OK. Neil and I are actually - done - anyway .
CATHERINE: Why did n't you tell us ? You should have told us .
LAURA: You have to come over and have dinne with me and Steven and the kids tonight , OK ? You can even stay over if you want .
CATHERINE: Why would she want to hang out with us and our husbands ? Seriously , Beth , is n't that exactly what you want to avoid right now ?
PAIGE: You know what - if being in the wedding is too painful-
BETH: You guys , it 's cool . I 'm fine . So I lost a little time . Big deal .
CATHERINE: So not a big deal . You 're still really young .
PAIGE: So young .
LAURA: Everything you learned in that elationship is just gon na make the next one so much stronger .
BETH: Exactly .
LAURA: She wasted so much time .
CATHERINE: I knew he was never gon na propose .
PAIGE: Shit .
BEN: I know it 's here somewhere . I spoke to George Lane in music , and he gave me this whole list of references for you .
ANNA: It 's cool . You can call me when you find it .
BEN: I swear I did n't lure you here unde false pretenses .
ANNA: I know . But a girl can dream .
BEN: We 'd been together since college . She gave me an ultimatum we get married o we break up . So , we got married .
ANNA: Seriously ? You just caved ?
BEN: It 's complicated .
ANNA: Really ?
BEN: You 're a dick if you date a girl for too long , and do n't marry her . But you marry her , and then you 're an asshole fo marrying her before you 're ready . Shit - I do n't know .
GIGI: Hi , this is Gigi .
ALEX: Gigi ?
GIGI: Gigi Phillips . I had the - umm - dentist pen .
ALEX: Right .
GIGI: I 'm really sorry to bug you . I just - I thought you had some really good insights the other night and I had a question .
ALEX: Okay , maybe I need to be harsh Cono is never going to be interested in you .
GIGI: No , I know . This is about - - Jarrad . You have a sec ?
ALEX: Okay
GIGI: So I meet him at happy hour and he was completely charming
ALEX: Lem me guess - he said the only thing happy about this hour is you .
GIGI: He may have used some derivative of that . So , he says he 's going to call , but then gave me his card and
ALEX: He 's not interested .
GIGI: You do n't even know if he called
ALEX: Did he ?
GIGI: No . But the thing is , I honestly think he 's expecting my call .
ALEX: He . Is . Not . Interested .
TYRONE: Alex - this is jacked . The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a white shirt this shirt is WHITE !
ALEX: If a guy gives you his phone number , instead of taking yours , he 's not interested .
GIGI: He took mine first , but then he
ALEX: And , if a guy wants to see you , he will see you . I once called 55 Lauren Bell 's until I got the right one .
GIGI: That 's cute . What happened ?
ALEX: As it turned out , her ass looked really huge in daylight .
GIGI: Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women ?
ALEX: Do n't call him . He does n't like you .
GIGI: Again with the sensitivity .
ALEX: Just trying to help .
GIGI: I know . Thanks .
MAYA: Oh sweetie - you did n't have to get me anything .
ANNA: Mom - you always say that and I always get you something .
MAYA: You did n't .
ANNA: It 's no big deal .
CONOR: What is it ?
MAYA: Here - put on my favorite .
CONOR: No . She did not .
MAYA: We met at a coffee shop in 1971 . Hell 's Kitchen . I had no idea who he was . But he had this big mop of hair and these eyes that just looked past you and through you and into you all at the same time . Complete interest and disinterest . It was amazing .
ANNA: Mom , please -
MAYA: It 's the truth . I knew them all . Robert Plant , Harry Nilsson , Graham Parsons Have you seen the pictures of me from when I was Anna 's age ?
CONOR: Umm - I do n't think so -
MAYA: Sweetie go get that picture - you know the one -
CONOR: Wow . That 's - unbelievable .
MAYA: So that 's what we 're dealing with here , for reference . Imagine meeting someone who looks like that in a coffee shop .
CONOR: That 's funny , because , I mean , I guess I kinda did . Anna and I met at a estaurant . That serves coffee . So , not a coffee shop , butstill -
MAYA: That 's sweet . But if we 're comparing stories - She 's no me - and you 're no Tim Buckley .
ANNA: Thanks again for coming with me . You make it so much easier .
ANNA: Yeah , well - cool 's not always what you 're looking for in a mom .
CONOR: So , you want another foot rub ?
ANNA: Ugh . I 'm just beat . I wan na put on sweats and get in bed .
CONOR: I 'd be into that .
ANNA: I 'll call you tomorrow , OK ?
TRENT: If a girl is into you , she 's sleeping with you . And if after a month - two months at the very outside - she 's not sleeping with you , she does not like you . I guess the trick is , how to spot this girl early - so you do n't waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that it 's never gon na happen . So , I 've got some signs about how to spot this girl - gleaned from my own experience , of course . A girl will never sleep with you if she calls you cuddly or dependable , she pops a zit in front of you , her name is Amber or Christine , she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1-3 . I know it 's not scientific - but I 'm just saying - you were warned .
ALEX: Hey dude - you here ?
CONOR: Funny .
ALEX: Need I ask ?
CONOR: It 's for work . I 'm trying to expand my client base .
ALEX: By pretending you 're gay ?
CONOR: No . By being more gay friendly .
ALEX: Or , in real estate terms , by becoming `` gay adjacent '' .
CONOR: Nice . I may have to use that .
ALEX: I do n't know . You dress like that - and you 're already seeing a girl who wo n't sleep with you - I think maybe you can pull it off .
CONOR: Pretty much , yeah . So , what do you think ?
ALEX: I think you 're gon na have to beat 'em away with a stick - you hot , sexy man .
GIGI: Who would have thought that a random girl from Pilates would fix me up with such a good kisser ?
GREGORY: Back at you sister .
GIGI: I ca n't wait to kiss you again .
GREGORY: Umm . We 're kissing right now .
GIGI: I know . But next time . The second date kiss is way more intimate .
GREGORY: Well , I 'm going out of town tomorrow - so I 'll be out of touch for a bit .
GIGI: Would you excuse me a quick second ? Too many diet cokes
ALEX: Yup .
GIGI: Hey , sorry to bug you again . Quick question .
ALEX: Would you excuse me a second , babe ?
GIGI: I 'm making out with a guy - PG stuff - and then he mentions he 's going out of town , so he 's gon na be out of touch .
ALEX: Run .
GIGI: But maybe he is going out of town .
ALEX: To where ? The Arab Emirates ? Where is he going that he has to be out of touch ?
GIGI: Where are you going out of town to again ?
ALEX: Run .
GIGI: So , now what ? I 'm just supposed to run from every guy who does n't like me ?
ALEX: Uhh - yeah .
GIGI: There 's not going to be anyone left .
ALEX: OK , I do n't know why I 'm saying this - ut I actually think I know a nice guy who you might like .
GIGI: Yeah ?
ALEX: Yeah . He 's a friend of my brother 's . Bill . We 'll all meet for a drink - it 'll e good .
GIGI: So , I 'm in his bathroom right now . What do I now ?
ALEX: You got ta come out eventually . But I 'd eally take my time . Let him sweat .
BEN: So , we ran into each other .
ANNA: You came to my class .
BEN: I did n't know it was your class .
ANNA: You called and asked me .
BEN: But you did n't call me back .
ANNA: Because you said not to call back if it was my class . Which it was .
BEN: We ran into each other .
ANNA: Totally . A couple of innocent folks - by happenstance - doing their daily workout near one another .
BEN: Exactly . Thank you .
ANNA: Wan na swim ?
BEN: I was just thinking - why ca n't we be friends ? Am I not allowed to make friends anymore ? Am I not allowed to be friends with hot people ? What kind of everse prejudice is that ?
ANNA: I hear you . Am I supposed to not be friends with a guy just because he 's married , and happens to have this insane smile and this ass that makes me want to dry hump ?
BEN: I think I just fell in love . A girl who talks about a dry hump .
ANNA: Classy , right ?
BEN: Classy is lame .
ANNA: So , friends , right ?
BEN: Totally .
ANNA: You wan na come in ?
BEN: I 'm sorry . I do n't trust myself .
ANNA: OK. You can just watch .
BEN: You may be the best friend I 've ever had .
JANINE: Honey - you smell different .
BEN: Different how ?
JANINE: I do n't know .
BEN: Well that 's an odd thing to say .
JANINE: Maybe it 's the ashtray and cigarettes I found . In the side yard . What part of `` my dad died of lung cancer '' is hard fo you to wrap your brain around ?
BEN: What ?
JANINE: Do not lie to me , Ben . Please .
BEN: Are you serious ? We have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily . You find cigarettes , and you automatically assume they 're mine ?
JANINE: Well , yes .
BEN: Honey , I 'm not lying . And you are really freaking out . I think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on . Just please - relax .
NEIL: Ah . My first visitor .
BEN: This boat is sick . How come you neve invited me out before ?
NEIL: Well , this was supposed to be just fo Beth and I - for our retirement . Leave our jobs . Sell the house . Take off .
BEN: It 's OK .
NEIL: So Janine sent you to check on me ?
BEN: Yeah . Pretty much .
NEIL: Any message from Beth ?
BEN: I think she 's been busy getting ready fo her sister 's funeral though , so
NEIL: Her sister 's what ?
BEN: Wedding . Her sister 's wedding . What did I say ?
NEIL: You said funeral .
BEN: No , I did n't . Shit , did I ?
NEIL: The marriage thing is weird , man . I never thought Beth would give me an ultimatum .
BEN: Really ? Why not ? That 's what women do .
NEIL: Right . I forgot . That 's how Janine got you to bite the bullet .
BEN: Yup .
NEIL: Do you regret it ?
BEN: No .
NEIL: So you 're happy ? You 'd say you 're happily married ?
BEN: I love Janine .
COUSIN: Now , I know when my cousin Paige says those vows tomorrow , there are going to e hearts breaking all over the world .
KEN: OK - that 's enough of the speeches . Time to eat . So enjoy the crab . And the yellow stuff is not hot mustard , it 's the crab 's hepatopancreas .
BETH: I know . And even he 's married .
KEN: So , you 'll get married a little bit late than some people . Big deal . You neve did anything the way every one else did it , and that 's what I 've always thought was so great about you .
BETH: I 'm your oldest daughter , and I 'm the only one not married . If this was Fiddler on the Roof you 'd have to sacrifice me or something .
KEN: Honey , look . When everyone else was just going to camp at the Y , you borrowed my New York Times , found some arts camp in the Berkshires , wrote away fo information , then got accepted on you own . You were nine . You never did things the way everyone else did .
BETH: Why not ?
KEN: Because that 's you . That 's why you 're my favorite daughter .
BETH: I do n't think you 're supposed to say that .
KEN: Well , I do n't give a shit . I 'm retired , and I 'll say what I want . I 'll say it into the mic if you want
BETH: That 's OK .
KEN: It 's true , though .
BETH: I know .
ALEX: Sorry I 'm late .
GIGI: That 's OK . I like a little time before a lind date - prepare myself mentally , emind myself not to tell the story about my molars
ALEX: He 's not coming .
GIGI: How can he already not like me ?
ALEX: I screwed up . I told Bill it was Thursday , but I meant Tuesday .
GIGI: Awesome . I 'm stuck here with a guy who ca n't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl - - she 's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak .
ALEX: Nope .
GIGI: How do you know ?
ALEX: See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise thing . She 's interested . He 's not .
GIGI: You can not tell from a cursory glance that he 's not interested .
ALEX: Actually , I can . I manage a restaurant . I see this stuff go down every night . Watch
GIGI: Man , you have a gift .
ALEX: And check out droopy dawg on her othe side . He can buy her drinks all night , and she 'll insist there 's no `` spark . ''
GIGI: Maybe there is n't . You need a spark .
ALEX: The `` spark '' thing is bullshit .
GIGI: Really ? Enlighten me .
ALEX: Guys invented the `` spark '' so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing , and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a `` spark . '' And you all buy it . You love it . You all thrive on it because you all love drama .
GIGI: I do n't .
ALEX: Really ? So you do n't wait until the last minute on deadlines , or on phone bills , ecause you love the drama of not knowing whether you 'll make it ?
GIGI: Maybe .
ALEX: And let me guess - when you were stalking Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days , even though the date was just kind of mediocre ?
GIGI: OK. Yeah .
ALEX: See , you thrive on drama . You got ta be more like me - if a girl likes me great , if not , there are plenty more like her - probably with smaller pores and bigge implants .
GIGI: That 's beautiful .
ALEX: Thanks .
GIGI: Why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again ?
ALEX: I dunno . I like you .
GIGI: You do ?
ALEX: Do n't start doodling my name on you inder . I just mean , I like you , like I like basset hounds . They 're kinda pathetic - so you want to cheer them up .
GIGI: Again with the sensitivity .
JANINE: It looks good .
JAVIER: Yes .
JANINE: He does good work .
JAVIER: He 's very good .
JANINE: Javier .
JAVIER: Yes .
JANINE: Javier , if I asked you an honest question , do you think you could give me an honest answer ?
JAVIER: I think so .
JANINE: Good . Because I think some of your guys have been - smoking .
JAVIER: Is that the question ?
JANINE: Yes .
JAVIER: Oh . It seemed like a statement .
JANINE: The question part was implied -
JAVIER: I did n't really hear it in the inflection-
JANINE: Javier - have your guys been smoking o not ?
JAVIER: No , ma'am . My guys do n't smoke on the job site . They 're all good guys .
JANINE: Are you sure your guys are n't sneaking around here ? And smoking ? And lying to me ? And smoking ?
JAVIER: I 'm pretty sure .
JANINE: I need you to be honest with me , Javier . Because I ca n't have someone lying to me . To my face . Under my roof . On my time .
JAVIER: That 's a lot of prepositions
JANINE: I mean , there is no reason for that kind of dishonesty , is there ? IS THERE ? I mean , we made promises to one another
JAVIER: Maybe I should just get back to work .
JANINE: Yes . Fine . Good idea .
CONOR: Hello , my name is Conor . Please sign in whenever you get a chance .
ANNA: This is insane . You 're like the Liza Minelli of real estate .
CONOR: I know . Your friend Mary 's a genius .
ANNA: Alright . Got ta run .
CONOR: You got a class ?
ANNA: Uh , no . Just some stuff . See you later ?
CONOR: Sure .
SKIP: She 's holding out on you , is n't she ?
CONOR: I 'm not sure I get your meaning .
LARRY: It 's obvious . She wo n't sleep with you . It 's written all over your puppy dog face .
CONOR: It 's killing me . Literally . I 'm dying .
LARRY: Here , have a cookie .
CONOR: I just - I have no idea what she 's doing . I can not read her signals - at all . We used to sleep together - all the time . Well , that 's not true , I do n't know why I said that , it was n't all the time . But it did happen - I know I 'm not making this up . And then , out of nowhere , it stops . But she still calls , she stops y , she sleeps on my couch , she wants a massage , she leaves cute messages - but it never goes ANYWHERE . I mean , what is she doing ?
LARRY: Honestly - we may not have the best insight . Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals .
SKIP: He 's right . Like - here 's `` I want to sleep with you '' .
LARRY: One , two , three - that 's it . Three seconds or more - it 's on .
SKIP: Here 's `` I do n't want to sleep with you . ''
LARRY: One , two - No . Thanks for playing . Move along .
SKIP: It 's that simple .
CONOR: You 're right . That 's no help at all .
LARRY: But listen - I can tell you this . Gay o straight , you 're not going to get anywhere by being inactive . She clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to e a man and do something . So the next time you 're in the position - do n't take no for an answer .
SKIP: That sounds like felonious advice .
LARRY: You 're right . Let me rephrase . Do n't take maybe for an answer .
BEN: Wait . Stop .
ANNA: What ?
BEN: Shit . This is bad .
ANNA: What ?
BEN: I am so into you .
ANNA: Why stop ?
BEN: Because I do n't do stuff like this .
ANNA: Stuff like what ?
BEN: Like having sex with women who are not my wife .
ANNA: First of all , I 'm not women . I 'm just one .
BEN: What 's second of all ?
ANNA: I did n't have a second of all .
BEN: I thought second of all was going to make me feel better .
ANNA: Second of all - I ca n't stop thinking about you , either .
BEN: I have to tell her .
ANNA: What ?
BEN: I have to tell her .
ANNA: I do n't want to push you to
BEN: I want to be with you . And I ca n't do that if I 'm lying to her .
ANNA: You know what 's best .
LOUIS: Here 's the thing - my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island . But if she was n't , I 'd tell her the same thing I 'd like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married guy .
ANNA: I 'm not picking out china patterns o anything - but I 've never felt anything like this before .
MARY: This is crazy . I ca n't believe he 's gon na leave his wife for you .
ANNA: No , he 's not leaving his wife for me . He 's just - he 's a good guy . And he ca n't really explore what we could be if he 's lying to her .
MARY: I do n't know . Remember Becca , my sister 's friend . Some guy waits on he at Bennigan 's - by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one .
ANNA: You 're totally right . It can happen .
MARY: Not for me .
ANNA: Well , what about texter ?
MARY: Texter has yet to make any verbal contact . I mean , this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice ox , breathing through a stoma , and I 'd never know because I never actually hea his voice .
ANNA: I doubt he has a stoma -
MARY: That 's not the point . The point is - I ca n't text . I 'm not charming via text . My sarcasm does n't come through , I ca n't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard
ANNA: So do n't text .
MARY: It 's not just texting . It 's email and voicemail and snail mail -
ANNA: That 's just mail -
MARY: Whatever . None of it 's working . I 've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work , and then I call him back at home , and he emails me to my Blackberry , and then I text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone and it just totally gets out of hand . I miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it did n't . That 's it . Now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies . It 's exhausting .
ANNA: So what about the singer guy ?
MARY: Jude . Yeah , I like him .
ANNA: That 's great .
MARY: Totally . I felt like we connected .
GIGI: Hello .
ALEX: Oh , hey . You 're home .
GIGI: Where am I supposed to be ?
ALEX: Out . It 's Saturday night .
GIGI: You wo n't let me go out with guys who do n't like me . It 's kind of limiting .
ALEX: I was just calling to let you know - I 'm having a party at my place next weekend . You should come .
GIGI: I do n't know . Wo n't Conor be there ? Might be kinda awkward .
ALEX: He 's in DC for the weekend at some real estate conference . But there 's gon na be a bunch of single guys .
GIGI: So I will have plenty of chances to be awkward . Thank god .
ALEX: Do n't worry . I 'll be there . I 'll talk you through it .
GIGI: So , the party - is it like a big party , more of a mellow hang or
ALEX: Yeah , OK. Got ta go - I think someone just dropped 84 wine glasses .
WATTS: Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who 'll e swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips .
KEITH: I think I can handle it .
WATTS: It 's cool . I was just gon na work on it with you but - if you 're comfortablegreat .
KEITH: Wait . How do you work on it ?
WATTS: Pretend I 'm a girl , OK ? I mean , pretend I 'm herAmanda .
GIGI: He 's into me .
JANINE: Awesome . I knew it . Who 's this now ?
GIGI: Alex . It 's totally clear to me now . He 's Watts .
JANINE: What ?
GIGI: From Some Kind of Wonderful .
JANINE: Wait , is n't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts ?
GIGI: Yes .
JANINE: So , why are n't you Watts ?
GIGI: I 'm Eric Stoltz .
JANINE: What ?
GIGI: Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones , ut really she 's in love with Eric Stoltz herself .
JANINE: Wait - so who 's Amanda Jones ?
GIGI: I guess Conor at first . Now men in general . But that 's not the point . The point is he 's into me .
JANINE: You know , I knew there had to be a reason he was spending all that time with you .
GIGI: I know ! It 's so obvious now there are so many signs .
JANINE: Oooh , gim me the signs . I love to hea about the signs .
GIGI: At first they were small - like when I first called he said `` Good to hear from you '' -
JANINE: Totally good sign .
GIGI: Right ? And then the next time I called he was with a woman - but he still took the call . And talked to me for a while .
JANINE: You know it was a woman ?
GIGI: He called her `` babe . ''
JANINE: A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to another woman - unless there 's something going on .
GIGI: I know ! And it gets more obvious . I mean , please - there was no guy he was going to fix me up with . The fix up was him .
JANINE: Wait - really ?
GIGI: He shows up - without this fictitious Bill character - and the two of us asically have a date . And then he calls me to invite me to a party at his place .
JANINE: You 're right . He so likes you .
MARY: There 's no way he 's already called - we only met for coffee last night . I mean we video iChatted . While holding coffee . Kinda like having coffee .
NATHAN: Just call your voice mail .
MARY: And he told me he had a gig last night , so he probably got in real late . Did I tell you he was singer ?
BRUCE: Just call .
JOSHUA: On speaker .
NATHAN: I just got hard .
BRUCE: Amazing . He 'll sing to your babies .
JANINE: That one .
BEN: No . That 's the laminate .
JANINE: That one is n't real hardwood floor ?
BEN: No . But it looks exactly the same - at like one one hundredth of the cost .
JANINE: I still wan na go with the real wood .
BEN: But you ca n't even tell the difference .
JANINE: That 's not the point .
BEN: Then what 's the point ?
JANINE: I just do n't like the way it 's pretending to be wood . If you 're not wood , then do n't try to look like wood .
BEN: I do n't think it 's pretending
JANINE: It 's a lie . Just be up front - tell people what you really are .
BEN: You 're right . I 'm sorry . You 're totally ight .
JANINE: It 's OK. Maybe we should look at the grills and come back .
BEN: I slept with someone .
JANINE: I heard you .
BEN: That is not why I -
JANINE: I knew it . I KNEW IT . You asshole .
BEN: I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry .
JANINE: And it 's you that 's been smoking , too , is n't it ?
BEN: What ? Why does that matter ?
BEN: No . No . I have n't .
JANINE: EXCUSE ME ? And now you want to move out ? You 're like - what - leaving me ?
BEN: No . NO . I just assumed that you would n't want me to
JANINE: We 're not going to deal with this ? We 're not going to figure out a way to work through this ?
BEN: I just assumed that once I told you , you would want me out .
JANINE: Is that what you want ?
BEN: No .
DAN: You must be Beth .
BETH: Yep .
DAN: I 've heard a lot about you from Paige . I 'd been lobbying for weeks to be seated next to her single sister .
BETH: Oh , yeah ? So you are - Dan .
DAN: Uh , sort of .
BETH: Hmmm ?
DAN: Well , I 'm actually a wiccan . So I have a magickal name .
BETH: Really ?
DAN: It 's Brother Phoenix East-Horse . But I did n't know if that would fit on a card .
NATHAN: It makes your breath stink .
GIGI: Pardon ?
NATHAN: Chex Mix . I learned the hard way . I made out with a guy after eating like a ag of the stuff . He said my breath smelled like trout .
GIGI: Thanks for the tip .
NATHAN: I 'm sorry . That was rude . And that guy I made out with was a total asshole .
BRUCE: You want me to smell you ? I 'm sure you do n't smell like trout .
GIGI: Thanks . I 'm good .
NATHAN: I 'm Nathan . This is Bruce .
GIGI: Gigi . How do you guys know Alex ?
BRUCE: We do n't . Our friend Mary heard about it from some guy named Conor .
NATHAN: How do you know Alex ?
GIGI: I hope - I mean I 'm pretty sure - something is about to happen between us .
NATHAN: So , you 're here as like a guest , or like his date ?
BRUCE: I hate that - when you do n't know if you 're a date - so you do n't know if you should bring a friend , or if you 're like co-hosting or if you should stay til the end to have alone time
GIGI: He did n't really say .
NATHAN: Cool .
BRUCE: I did get a slight waft of trout , though . Take a mint .
GIGI: Thank you .
DOMINIC: So , where 's Neil ?
BETH: We actually broke up .
DOMINIC: No way . You guys were together for like ten years .
BETH: Seven . But yes , a long time .
DOMINIC: Too bad cousins ca n't marry , huh ? Cuz then we could maybe
BETH: Eeew Dominic , gross .
ALEX: I had no idea it would be such a madhouse .
GIGI: Hey . Great party .
ALEX: Are any guys hitting on you ? Do you need me to evaluate their level of interest ?
GIGI: They were gay . Even I know that thei level of interest was probably low .
ALEX: Well - too bad Bill could n't make it . I still think you guys would hit it off .
GIGI: Oh OK . Right . `` Bill '' .
ALEX: Anyway - I 'm on my way to put out some more liquor . But it looks like the food could use some refreshing
GIGI: You mean , kind of like - co-hosting ?
ALEX: Uhh , OK . The chips are on top of the fridge .
GIGI: Thanks . When Alex said he wanted to have a party , I was like `` Let 's do it . ''
TALL GIRL: No , that 's OK . I got it .
GIGI: What ?
TALL GIRL: Alex asked me to get the dip together . Thanks for getting it started .
GIGI: When someone 's underwear ends up in you toaster oven - it 's been a good party .
ALEX: I guess people had fun .
TALL GIRL: Alex , you want me to start cleaning up ?
GIGI: That 's sweet of you . But I thought I 'd stick around , so I 'll take care of it .
TALL GIRL: No . I got it .
ALEX: Knock yourselves out .
GIGI: I think I 've rounded up the last of the eer bottles .
TALL GIRL: YES ! ! Suck it !
ALEX: You are sensational .
TALL GIRL: Did you say it 's past three ? Man , I got ta go .
ALEX: Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but I really got ta get to bed .
GIGI: Is that an invitation ?
ALEX: What ?
GIGI: I 'm sorry . That was cheesy . I 'm not good at this .
ALEX: Wait - what ?
GIGI: Ummmm .
ALEX: Now you and I are in a relationship ?
GIGI: Well , I 'd say if we 're not at elationship stationship , we 're at least on the track .
ALEX: And why would you think that , exactly ?
GIGI: Because there were - you know - signs .
ALEX: Really ? Like what ?
GIGI: Ummm - it was good to hear from me . You talked to me even when you were with a girl . I felt something
ALEX: What are you talking about ? What have I een saying since I met you ? If a guy wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN .
SOFTLY: No .
ALEX: Why would you do this ?
GIGI: I thought you were Watts .
ALEX: Why do women do this ? Why do they build this stuff up in their minds , take each little thing a guy does and twist it into something else
GIGI: I 'd rather be like that - than like you .
ALEX: Excuse me ?
GIGI: Maybe I dissect each little thing , and put myself out there too much , and maybe I even thrive on the drama of it all ut at least that means I still care . You think you 've won because women are expendable to you ? Sure , you do n't get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way , ut you do n't fall in love that way , either . You have n't won , Alex . You 're alone .
BETH: You want anything else ?
KEN: Yeah . Less of that cardboardy brown stuff . More regular people food .
BETH: The cardboardy brown stuff is called whole grain bread .
KEN: Maybe you could just fry me up a couple sausage links ?
BETH: People who have just had heart attacks generally are not advised to eat animal fat , stuffed in synthetic casings .
KEN: Did I tell you that you 're not only my favorite daughter , but you 're also the prettiest ? So much better looking than those other dogs . Seriously .
BETH: It 's not gon na work this time . But I appreciate the effort .
STEVEN: Hey , Beth . Grab me a beer if you 're going that way ?
BETH: You might wan na kill the volume just a smidge . My mom is finally taking a nap .
DEVON: You think your dad really wants to hang on to all this vinyl ? My collection could use a bunch of these .
BETH: Turn it the fuck down .
CATHERINE: What am I gon na do without dad ?
BETH: First of all , he 's upstairs watching 'Oprah After The Show ' .
LAURA: And second of all - you have us .
CATHERINE: But he 's always been - the one who 's there for me .
BETH: What about your husband ? Where the hell is he ?
CATHERINE: Playing ultimate frisbee . His team may make the quarterfinals .
GIGI: Do you know who it is ?
JANINE: It does n't matter .
GIGI: So are you going to - leave - him ?
JANINE: Gigi , he 's my husband . He 's not just some guy that did n't call me back . And he did admit it to me . He did n't wait to get caught . That takes courage .
GIGI: It 's OK .
JANINE: It 's my fault , you know .
GIGI: What ?
JANINE: I 'm willing to accept my responsibility in this . I forced him into getting married . He was n't ready .
GIGI: Janine - this is not your fault .
JANINE: It is . I 've - changed . I used to be fun . I was fun when we met .
GIGI: You 're still fun .
JANINE: We never have sex anymore .
GIGI: Lots of couples got through lulls .
JANINE: No . We never have sex . Realistically , what did I expect him to do ?
GIGI: I do n't think that 's really
JANINE: This is too small . I got ta tell Javier .
GIGI: What ?
JANINE: This tile . I got ta go . Tell Beth I took a personal day .
MARIEL: My first husband was unimpressive . I found him in bed with his big breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives . So unoriginal , it made me feel sorry for him . My second husband was a pinch more creative . Cheated on me with my sister - but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious . At last - some intrigue , some mind games - though my sister 's two year old eventually gave them up . But my last husband he was a gem . A veritable master at covering his tracks . I poured over his phone records , intercepted his credit card bills , had him followed on countless occasions - and never found a single shred of evidence . It was n't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress . But the real master , I have to say is me . Three husbands countless boyfriends , and I have n't been caught yet .
ANNA: Oh my god , oh my god , oh my god
BEN: It was all you , babe .
ANNA: Oh my god , oh my god , oh my god .
BEN: This is really good news .
ANNA: I can not believe this . He liked my demo . Did you hear what he said ? When he said it was hauntingly beautiful ? Did you hear that part ?
BEN: Yep . I was sitting right there .
ANNA: Thank you . Thank you so much .
BEN: How is it that every time I see you ody , I 'm shocked at how beautiful it is ?
ANNA: Is -
BEN: Shit . I told Dana to get this lock fixed . One sec .
JANINE: Why do you even lock it ?
BEN: I 'd never get anything done if I did n't .
JANINE: Can I come in ?
BEN: Of course .
JANINE: Sit down .
JANINE: I do n't know . I just thought - maybe we could , you know , relight the fire .
BEN: Honey , did you hear what I just said ? I got ta get this offering statement out .
JANINE: Look , I am trying here . Do you want to save our marriage or do n't you ?
ALEX: OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and pitch in with the servers when you -
TYRONE: NoI 'm on 8 thru 10 . I 'm always on 8 through 10 . Been working here 18 months doing 8 through 10 .
ALEX: Right . Luis you take 4 through 6 .
TYRONE: Dude . Luis quit like 10 months ago .
ALEX: Do we even need to have this meeting ? Seriously ? Does this serve any purpose ?
KELLI ANN: Since you asked me 11 minutes ago ? No , not a lot of phone traffic .
ALEX: What ?
KELLI ANN: It 's happened to you .
ALEX: What has happened to me ?
KELLI ANN: What 's her name ?
ALEX: Who ?
KELLI ANN: The girl , Alex .
ALEX: There 's no girl .
KELLI ANN: You ca n't hide it man . I know strung out and you are strung - out .
ALEX: Please -
KELLI ANN: This is amazing . Ca n't focus , right ? Jumping every time your phone rings , checking your email 100 times a day . Wishing you could write songs . Feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations
ALEX: Shit .
KELLI ANN: Welcome to my world asshole .
JANINE: You sure I ca n't interest you in a little eef and broccoli ? I 'm treating .
BEN: I really got ta get this stuff done .
JANINE: OK . I 'll see you at home . I love you .
BEN: I love you too .
ANNA: You make me sick to my stomach . You are a disgusting excuse for a man -
BEN: I did n't want to do it , Anna . You know that it 's you I want to be with -
ANNA: Are you kidding me ? You will never lay a hand on me again . I may just be a piss poor girl from Dundalk who works at a gym - but I am so too good for you .
GIGI: Dino , thank you again for letting me pay over the phone . I assure you this late payment thing will never happen again . Yep just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life .
MANS' VOICE: Hi , Gigi . This is Bill .
GIGI: Ummm -
BILL: Alex 's friend . We were supposed to meet up - but Alex told me the wrong day .
GIGI: Bill . So you do exist .
BILL: I do . And I 'd love to buy you dinne sometime if you 're game .
GIGI: Yes . Sure . Why not ?
ANNA: I 'm gon na go . I left the check on the counter . It should at least get you through this month .
MAYA: Thanks sweetie . I do n't know what I would do without you .
ANNA: No , it 's not that . I mean - yes , I 'm oke - but it 's not that . It 's just - I 'm just so lost mom . I 've been seeing this guy - who is exciting and amazing and thoroughly unavailable . I thought he was - the one - but he turned out to be such an asshole .
MAYA: Conor -
ANNA: Yeah . Who I 'm so horrible to . But he takes it . And he 's - there . Waiting . But I just do n't want to - I do n't know -
MAYA: Settle ? Like you think I did ?
ANNA: Are you kidding ? All you talk about are the things you did n't do , the people you wish you could have been with , the Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had .
MAYA: Those are just dreams Anna .
ANNA: Like what ?
MAYA: Like wishing you had .
ANNA: Hey , sweetie .
CONOR: See , why did you call me sweetie ?
ANNA: Because we always call each other that .
CONOR: Why ?
ANNA: I know that I -
CONOR: Let me finish . Maybe it 's my fault . Maybe I have n't been clear about what I want . So let me be clear . I love hanging out , but I am so attracted to you , and I just - I want both . I want to make love to you . I know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth - I just freaked myself out , too - ut it 's true . And I 'm not sure what happened , or why we stopped - but I do n't eally care . I just
CONOR: What ?
CONOR: I 'm talking about really doing this . Like a full-on relationship .
ANNA: Right .
CONOR: With me .
ANNA: Yes .
CONOR: Did a bunch of gay people put you up to this ?
ANNA: Please stop talking .
DEVON: Shit ! Take him out . He 's done .
GEORGE: Jesus . This is n't some exhibition game .
STEVEN: Could you
BETH: Did anyone have time to run to the store ?
GEORGE: Nah , we 're good . We just got drive through .
BETH: I did n't mean for you .
NEIL: The dishes are all put away . There 's a load of laundry still drying , but the other one is folded on top of the washer .
JANINE: Javier - does this mean what I think it means ? So when you say `` done '' - you do n't mean `` we still need plumbing in the upstairs bathrooms done '' - you mean `` done done '' ? Wow - you 're amazingOKI 'll call when I see itBye .
NEIL: Hey .
BETH: It 's been a while since I 've been here . Turns out - that boat in the next mooring , looks like yours not yours .
NEIL: Oh no .
BETH: No , it 's no problem . Nice guy . Invited me in for a white wine spritzer . Not sure he gets a lot of visitors .
NEIL: Of course . I really care about your dad . And I really love you . Even if I ca n't give you what you want .
BETH: You 're what I want .
NEIL: And you 'd really be OK if we take the marriage thing off the table ?
BETH: If you promise to love me and be committed to me -
NEIL: I always have -
BETH: Wait , I 'm not done . And snake the showe drain when my hair clogs it , and let me eat Wheat Thins in bed .
NEIL: I do .
BETH: I guess . But , you can not bring those .
NEIL: What ? You 're just mad at me , and you 're taking it out on the pants .
BETH: Look , I got ta win something . I let you win the big battle , so throw me a bone .
NEIL: OK. We 're not getting married , but I 'm chucking the pants .
BETH: Great . We both win .
ALEX: Hey , Gigi . It 's Alex . I was just wondering how you were doing . It 's been a little while since we 've talked and I was wondering how you were doing .
TYRONE: Dude .
ALEX: I know . I know .
ANNA: You seriously get a ton of people bidding on this ?
CONOR: I know it 's crazy . But it 's a neighborhood `` in transition . ''
ANNA: So that means what - that hip gay people want to live out here ?
CONOR: Yeah . Hip gay people , young couples , young families .
ANNA: Weird - it totally reminds me of the house I grew up in . I bet there is a -
CONOR: Well , the open house is tomorrow . But I have this one buyer . I mean , I want to see if his girlfriend likes it first -
ANNA: His girlfriend ?
CONOR: I mean , I had this idea -
ANNA: An idea for the open house ?
CONOR: No , an idea . For this house . For - me . To buy . And hopefully , if you like it and things continue to - you know
ANNA: I ca n't do this Conor .
CONOR: OK . If it 's too fast -
ANNA: No . I mean this . Any of this . What you 're saying - what you 're offering - is what every girl wants . It 's what I 've always wanted . It 's just -
CONOR: You do n't want it with me .
ANNA: Okay .
CONOR: Is it too late to dial it back to before - and just keep sleeping together ?
GIGI: So , Alex told me you work in finance .
BILL: Yes . Yes , I do . Finance .
GIGI: This is nice .
BILL: It is .
GIGI: A nice evening . And you planned it . And called me when you said you would . And showed up on time . Thank you , Bill .
BILL: You 're very welcome .
GIGI: It was nice meeting you .
BILL: Thank you for a lovely evening .
GIGI: You , too .
ALEX: Yeah . I did .
GIGI: Really ? What did you forget ?
ALEX: This .
NEIL: How did all this stuff fit in here fine efore ?
BETH: I do n't know . It expanded .
NEIL: What ? I have no idea what you 're -
BETH: We had a deal . These are not staying .
NEIL: That 's really gon na free up a lot of space .
BETH: They 're going . I have a bag I 'm taking to the Goodwill .
NEIL: Okay , okay . You win . Just check to make sure there 's nothing in the pockets efore we give them away .
BETH: Yes . Of course , yes .
GIGI: You came all the way here - at 11 at night - to give me back a promotional pen ?
ALEX: I thought I better come up with some excuse to get over here . Is n't that how it 's done ?
GIGI: Sometimes .
ALEX: Look , I ca n't stop thinking about you . I drive by your place . I call and hang up . I 'm turning into -
GIGI: Me .
ALEX: Yeah .
GIGI: Well , a wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl , he will make it happen . No matter what .
ALEX: True .
GIGI: Hmmm . Because when I was hurling my body onto yours - you did not seem to want to `` make it happen . ''
ALEX: Here 's the thing about that . You were ight . I 've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these women , having the power - that I did n't know what it felt like when I actually - fell - for one of them .
GIGI: Look , I 've just been out with your friend Bill . And it just might be exactly what I need . No drama . He calls . He does what he says .
ALEX: I could do that stuff too .
GIGI: But you did n't . And that same wise person told me that I am the rule . That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change - stop thinking that I will e the
ALEX: You are my exception .
NATHAN: Jonathan ?
MARY: Hey , Conor . I 'm Mary .
CONOR: You , too .
MARY: I 'd love to .
BEN: Shit
NEW GUY: It was nice meeting you .

WAINGRO: Yeah .
CERRITO: Okay .
WAINGRO: You guys always work together ?
CERRITO: All the time .

TOWNER: Yeah .
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Daddio 's jazz patio on KDCA . Brought to you this fine day , which is A-okay , by Twister . Hey , mister , go out and buy a ottle of that TwisterWiiiiiine

NEIL: Two minutes , fifty seconds .
GUARD #1: 211 ! We 're being taken down !
TOWNER: There 's the call . Three minutes .
NEIL: 8o seconds left . Move it .
WAINGRO: Flatten - up against it ! Higher !
GUARD TWO: you did n't have that gun..
WAINGRO: What ? !
CERRITO: That 's true , slick , cause you 're a real tough guy . But he has the gun . And me , too . So shut the fuck up .
NEIL: Move out ! 38 seconds left !
NEIL: Ten . Nine . Blew the margin . Here we come .
TOWNER: One on your tail .
NEIL: Here we come .
NATE: A million , six at 40 cents onna dollar 's 640 . Here 's a hundred forty thou front money . Get you the rest , 2-3 days .
NEIL: I do n't want to talk about it .
NATE: Wait a minute .
NEIL: What 's the matter ?
NATE: You know who these belong to ?
NEIL: `` Malibu Securities
NATE: You know John Van Zant ?
NEIL: No .
NATE: Malibu Securities is a brokerage he controls . Planned ankruptcies , made out during the S & L 's , money laundering Nate pulls T.C . 's .
NEIL: So what ? He 's got insurance .
NATE: That 's the point . On top of collecting his insurance , maybe he wants to buy back his bonds . From him I can get you 60 cents on the dollar instead of 40 . Means an extra 320 to you .
NEIL: Try it on .
NATE: You know Cezar Kelso ?
NEIL: By reputation .
NATE: He 's got this score he 's putting out and wants you to look at .
NEIL: What do I need look at his score for ? I got my own .
NATE: He said you 'll get near eight figures . Very clean .
NEIL: 9 00a.M . tomorrow .
NATE: Take it easy .
HEINZ: Masks , guns , radios - all left ehind . No prints .
HANNA: What about the crash , the white towtruck .
HEINZ: Has n't turned up . Got a witness janitor next door .
HANNA: I.D . anybody ? Plate ? Description ?
HEINZ: Shhaaapes One big . One thin . He heard it Guy 's nearly blind .
HANNA: What about them ?
DRUCKER: According to the janitor , he Started mouthing off to one of the gunmen .
HANNA: Oh , that was smart .
DRUCKER: I figure the other went for that gun when the shooting started . One guy called a guard `` slick . ''
HANNA: `` Slick ? ''
DRUCKER: Yeah . And they ignored the loose cash .
HANNA: 'Cause they had no time , cause they knew our response time , cause they were on our air .
HEINZ: You recognize their m.o . ?
HANNA: Yeah . Their m.o . is that they are good . Once it escalated into a Murder One beef for all of them after they killed the first two , they popped guard number three 'cause it did n't ake any difference anymore , so why leave a living witness ? Drop of a hat ? They 'll rock and oll . Also the way they went into the side indicates they are equipped to go in on the prowl . So also start looking for recent highline burgularies that have 'mystified ' us . Run the `` slick '' bit to the FBI and see what it kicks out .
DRUCKER: I called it in already .
HANNA: Split the fences . I 'll take Cuzomano and Torena . You take the East side . Go through the tapes of who we been listening to . Hang in with Forensics on all physical evidence . How 'd they know the route of the van and what it was carrying ? Does Gage print the day 's routes ? What do they do with the printouts ? Who collects thei trash ? Run makes on all thei middlemanagement . Did someone give this score up ? Check the three guards . See if one of them was a tipster .
BOSKO: What 's the vibe home-grown o out-of-town ?
HANNA: Out-of-town . Frankly , I hope they are scoring once and passing through . And I doubt it .
HEINZ: This going to stay in Area ?
HANNA: This look like boosters working the local Seven Eleven to you ? It goes to Major Crime . Go to work .
WAINGRO: Anybody want some pie ?
NEIL: This is a partial split , but I took out of ours - every - to make up his full end . Because I want to settle him up and get rid of this jagoff right now . Cerrito and Chris looks at Waingro .

The branches have to buttress their cash accounts to handle Friday payroll checks from a Toyota and Nissan plant , a steel mill and two efineries . One day a week , Thursday , the main branch carries the full whack .
NEIL: You want a $ 100,000 advance , against a full 101 . Why ?
CEZAR: 'Cause I can get it . 'Cause this is the best thing I seen in three years . 'Cause a screw-up makes 10 percent of nothin ' equal nothin ' . And 'cause those are the terms and they ai n't negotiable .
NEIL: On the prowl or strong ?
CEZAR: Strong . Through the front door . During the day .
NEIL: How many guys ?
CEZAR: Four . Three plus a driver .

CEZAR: Three alarms . And that 's why the price . 'Cause you chop-in through the roof the night before on the prowl and bypass 'em . I got circuit diagrams , blue prints , the works . So yeah , they hit the alarms , but nothing gon na happen .
NEIL: Do I have to kill people ?

NEIL: With the heat we got , you wan na play World War Two in the streets with Van Zant ?
CERRITO: Van Zant gets a pass ? !
NEIL: Fuck Van Zant . I got more motivation to whack him than you do . He is a luxury . Our problem is jam and take the bank o split . And I mean right fucking now . Do not go home , pack , nothing . Thirty seconds from now we are on the road . Gone . No answer . Chris and Cerrito are thinking .
CHRIS: For me , the bank 's worth the stretch . I say accept the risk , stay .
NEIL: Michael ?
CERRITO: I roll with you . Whatever
NEIL: Not on this one , Michael . On this one you make up your own mind .
CERRITO: you figure this the best thing to do ?

NEIL: All right . All right .
CERRITO: That the place ?
NEIL: Yeah . You see how the road leads ack around ?
CERRITO: Yeah .
NEIL: That 's the escape route
CASALS: I know . Let 's go !
CASALS: They were looking at something southwest
HANNA: What's 's that down there ?
CASALS: An auto parts company . They 're going to knock over a payroll ?
SCHWARTZ: The company only pays by check .
HANNA: Maybe they 're gon na steal the hub caps O.S . we HEAR a CLICK .
SCHWARTZ: That 's what we were trying to figure .
HANNA: I got an idea what they 're looking at . You know what they 're looking at ?
NATE: Worth it ?
NEIL: There 's enough circuit diagrams and blueprints here to build the ank . It 's terrific .
NATE: His name is Hanna ; first name , Vincent . I smeared this sergeant in vice five yards . Hanna 's all over you . He 's a hot dog . Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit . He 's taken down some heavy crews . Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago and he was a fucking maniac . Was working Narcotics efore that . He 's good , Neil . Dedicated . Divorced three times . Current wife 's Justine . He 's why the extra heat . Vice sergeant says Hanna likes you . Thinks you 're some kind of 'star . ' 'You do this sharp , you do that sharp . Look how sharp this guy is to figure that . ' Neil laughs .
NEIL: I 've had heat before .
NATE: That 's not the point .
NEIL: This one 's worth the stretch
NATE: You sure ?
NEIL: I 'm sure . Drop me at the garage .
HUGH: Hear from him yet ?
VAN ZANT: Not a thing .
HUGH: Maybe he went away .
VAN ZANT: Yeah . Sure . Not hearing bothers me more Where 's this guy ? Hugh gestures down the corridor .
HUGH: This guy herewe put him on . Turns out he knows McCauley .
WAINGRO: Waingro . My name 's Waingro .
VAN ZANT: I been living in this office day and night . What 's with you friend ?
WAINGRO: I know all about how he thinks . We took some major scores together . He 's probably busy ight now . But he 's real thorough . He wo n't forget you
VAN ZANT: That 's reassuring .
WAINGRO: Yeah , I got some moves I could make here , that could be a big help to you
HANNA: Justine ? No answer .
JUSTINE: Out .
HANNA: You know I 'm on you . Let 's talk .
NEIL: Sure . Buy me a cup of coffee . Hanna crosses back to his car .
HANNA: Seven years in San Quentin . In the hole for three . McNeil before that .
NEIL: Yeah .
HANNA: Was McNeil as tough as they say ?
NEIL: You looking to become a penologist ?
HANNA: You looking to go back ? I chased some crews , the guys were lookin ' to fuck up and get busted back .
NEIL: You must have worked some dipshit crews .
HANNA: I worked all kinds .
NEIL: You see me doing thrill-seeke liquor store holdups with a `` Born to Lose '' tattoo on my chest ?
HANNA: No , I do not .

HANNA: Then do n't take down scores .
NEIL: I do what I do best . I take scores . You do what you do best trying to stop guys like me .
HANNA: You never wanted a normal-type life ?
NEIL: What the fuck is that ? Barbecues and ballgames ?
HANNA: That 's part of it .
NEIL: That 's nice . That your life ?
HANNA: No . My wife spends half he time on the couch . My stepdaughter 's got problems 'cause her real father 's a world class asshole . And every moment I got , I 'm chasing guys like you .
NEIL: A man told me once you want to make moves ? Do n't keep anything in your life you 're not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner . So if you 're chasing me and you got ta move when I move , how do you expect to keep a family ?
HANNA: What are you , a monk ?
NEIL: No . I got a woman .
HANNA: What do you tell her ?
NEIL: She thinks I sell swimming pools .
HANNA: And if you spot me around the corner . You gon na walk out on her ? Leave her flat ? Like that ? Not even say goodbye ?
NEIL: That 's the discipline .
HANNA: What you 're left with is pretty empty .
NEIL: Yeah ? Then maybe you and me , we should oth go do somethin ' else , pal .
HANNA: I do n't know how to do anything else .
NEIL: neither do I .
HANNA: And I do n't much want to .
NEIL: Neither do I .
HANNA: We 're sitting here like a coupla egular fellas . You do what you do . I do what I got ta do . What happens if I am there and I got to put you away ? I wo n't like it . But , if it 's etween you and some poor bastard whose wife you 're going to make into a widow , brother , you are gon na go down . 'Cause you do n't
NEIL: There 's a flip side to that coin . What if you got me boxed in and I got ta put you down ? 'Cause no matter what , you will not get in my way . But now that we been face to face , I would not feel good about that . But I wo n't hesitate . Not for one second .
HANNA: Maybe it 'll happen that way . O who knows
NEIL: maybe we 'll never see each other again .
HANNA: Can we have the bill .
DRUCKER: They dumped us !
HANNA: What ?
DRUCKER: They dumped us .
HANNA: I was just with him !
DRUCKER: With who ?

BREEDAN: Looks right . Come out the door , your angle takes you into the car . Do n't have to run around the doors . You want them open ?

VERONICA: I 'm sorry , it 's just why ca n't we talk to different kinds of people ?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Fuck me gently with a chainsaw . Do I look like Mother Theresa ? If I did , I probably would n't mind talking to the Geek Squad .
RODNEY: Did you see that ? Heather Numbe One looked right at us .
BIG CYNIC: It must be love .
VERONICA: Does n't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you 're a pirahna ?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Like I give a shit . They all want me , as a friend or a fuck . I 'm worshipped at Westerburg and I 'm only a Junior .
VERONICA: Pretend you 're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Whatever . I do n't believe this . We 're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we 're brushing up ou conversation skills with the scum of the school .
BIG CYNIC: Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the last day of Mankind . You sentimental old fart .
BRACES: Geez , forget it .
VERONICA: What about you Rodney ?
RODNEY: I told you she knew my name . I 'd change my life . New clothes . New haircut . New house . New home .
HEATHER CHANDLER: How sad ! Blowing all your cash on two days of trying to be hip .
VERONICA: If you 're going to openly be a bitch .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God , scan on Martha Dumptruck .
HEATHER CHANDLER: This is the part I hate . The waiting . I 'd say we 're like twenty minutes from major humiliation . Come on , Veronica .
VERONICA: Damn..
MATT: You get five million dollars but some Martians are going to zap you in two days . You hear that , Clyde ? That 's got to be the most spooky-ass question I 've ever heard .
BETTY FINN: I think we should use the money for an End-of-the-world get-together . We could invite guys .
RAM: I 'd pay Madonna one million dollars to ride my face like the Kentucky Derby . She should be paying me , though .
CLYDE: If you want a good way to go out efore the aliens land , get a lion from the zoo . Put a remote control omb up its butt . When the lion starts tearing you up , press the bomb button . You and the lion die like as one .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Just imagine somebody like you quasi-fat , goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial . No one would buy Crest .
VERONICA: Do n't tell me . Crest would be stained with loserness .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Yeah , and who wants that on their teeth ?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Oh God , here we go
PETER: A dime increases the time ! A buck ings good luck ! Hi Veronica . A five keeps the neighborhood alive ! A ten and you die without sen !
HEATHER CHANDLER: You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school . If I was n't already the head of it , I 'd want the same thing .
VERONICA: I 'm sorry ? What are you oozing about ?
HEATHER CHANDLER: That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy , ut you 're determined to ruin my day .
VERONICA: We made a girl want to conside suicide . What a scream . What a jest .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Come on you jerk . You know you used to have a sense of humor .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Ku-urt , I ne-ed an orgasm .
VERONICA: A true friend 's work is never done .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Grow up , Heather . Bulimia 's so '86 .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Color me nauseous .
VERONICA: Maybe you should see a doctor .
HEATHER DUKE: Yeah , maybe .
VERONICA: Geez , do n't listen to them .
HEATHER DUKE: Yeah , you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye would n't put up with their bogus nonsense .
VERONICA: Well , you better move Holden out of the way or he 's going to get spewed .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God Veronica , drool much ? His name 's Jason Dean . He 's in my American History .
VERONICA: Give me the clipboard .
JASON: Greetings and salutations . Call me J.D . Are you a Heather ?
VERONICA: No , a Veronica . Sawyer . This may seem like a stupid question .
RAM: Who does that new kid think he is with that coat ? Bo Diddley ?
KURT: Veronica is into his act . No doubt .
RAM: Let 's kick his ass .
KURT: Shit , we 're seniors , Ram . Too old for that crap . Let 's give him a scare though .
VERONICA: How very .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Come on . VERONICA Later .

KURT: What did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood , Ohio ?
RAM: Answer him dick !
KURT: Hey Ram , does n't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule ?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God , they wo n't expell him . They 'll just suspend him for a week or something .
HEATHER CHANDLER: He used a real gun . They should throw his ass in jail .
VERONICA: No way . He used blanks . All J.D . eally did was ruin two pairs of pantsMaybe not even that Can you bleach out urine stains ?
HEATHER CHANDLER: J.D. ? You seem pretty amused . I thought you were giving up on high school guys .
VERONICA: Never say never .
HEATHER DUKE: What are you going to do , Heather ? Take the two shots or send me out ?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Did you have a brain tumor fo eakfast ? First you ask if you can e red , knowing that I 'm always red
HEATHER DUKE: Shit .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Damn . It 's your turn Heather .
HEATHER DUKE: No , it 's Heather 's turn .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Anyway , I can say never to high school . I 've got David .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: King David .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Maybe when you hit maturity you 'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram `` Wham-bam- thank-you-maam '' Sweeney . HEATHER MCNAMARA misses her next shot .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Ram 's sweet . Yo Heather , you 're up .

HEATHER CHANDLER: Yeah , let 's party .
DAVID: She loves to party .
BRAD: So , are you a cheerleader ?
VERONICA: No , not at all .
BRAD: You 're pretty enough to be one .
VERONICA: Gee , thanks .
BRAD: It 's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask `` What 's your major ? '' I hate that .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Come on David , let 's go back to the party .
DAVID: Do n't worry , we will . You 're just so hot tonight . I ca n't control myself . DAVID pushes HEATHER CHANDLER 's head down .
BRAD: So what do you say we head up to my oom and have a real party . I 've got the best Windham Hill C.D . collection in the dorm .
VERONICA: Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything .
BRAD: Phil Collins ? Are you sure he is n't drinking and driving ?
VERONICA: Jeez , right , then why do n't I do drugs ?
BRAD: Hey , do n't run away now .
VERONICA: J.F.K . !

VERONICA: Hey really , I do n't feel so great .
BRAD: Let 's do it on the coats . It 'll e excellent .

HEATHER CHANDLER: What 's your damage ? Brad says you 're being a real cooze .
VERONICA: Heather , I feel awful , like I 'm going to throw up . Can we jam , please ?
HEATHER CHANDLER: No . Hell no .
HEATHER CHANDLER: You stupid cunt !
VERONICA: You goddamn bitch !
HEATHER CHANDLER: You were nothing before you met me ! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn ! You were a Brownie , you were a Bluebird , you were a Girl Scout Cookie ! I got you into a Remington Party ! What 's my thanks ? It 's on the hallway carpet . I get paid in puke !
VERONICA: Lick it up , baby . Lick . It . Up .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Monday morning , you 're history . I 'll tell everyone about tonight . Transfe to Washington . Transfer to Jefferson . No one at Westerburg 's going to let you play their reindeer games .
VERONICA: S'okay .
MRS. CHANDLER: We are leaving soon for you grandmother 's . If you care to join us
HEATHER CHANDLER: Bag that .
MRS. CHANDLER: Is that a `` No '' in your lingo ?
HEATHER CHANDLER: Lingo this .
VERONICA: Trust me . She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma 's even when she 's not hungover .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Veronica . And Jesse James . Quelle surprise . Hear about Veronica 's affection for regurgitation ?
VERONICA: We both said a lot of things we did n't mean , last night .
HEATHER CHANDLER: Did we ? How the hell 'd you get in here ?
VERONICA: No shit , sherlock . I ca n't believe it . I just killed my best friend .
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Any other Principal would take the same position . Keep things business as usual .
COUNSELOR HYDE: Heather Chandler 's not your everyday suicide . She was very popular .
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: I let the kids go before lunch and the switchboard 'll light up like a Christmas Tree .
KEVIN STAPLES: The parents will be sympathetic , sir . These are troubled times for the young .
MRS. POPE: I must say I was impressed to see that she made proper use of the word `` myriad '' in her suicide note afte utalizing it in a vocabulary test .
PAULINE: I find it profoundly disturbing that we are told of a tragic destruction of youth and all we can talk about is adequate mourning times and misused vocabulary words . A collective sigh goes across the room .
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Oh Christ .
PAULINE: The school , meaning both students and teachers , must revel in this evealing moment . I suggest we get everyone into the cafeteria and just talk . And feel . Together .
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Thank you , Ms. Fleming . Call me when the shuttle landsNow is this Heather the cheerleader ?
COUNSELOR HYDE: That would be Heather Mcnamara .
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Damn . I 'd be willing to go half a day for a cheerleader .
KEVIN STAPLES: Let 's just pack it in an hour early .
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Done . I hate Mondays .
PAULINE: I said a circle you imbeciles ! Forget it ! Just sit down . I 'm just so thrilled < /u to be given an example of everything I 've taught you . That example is Heather Chandler . I have the note !
MALE STUDENT: All right !
PAULINE: I 'll pass the suicide note around the room so you can feel its tragic eauty for yourself . Let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all . Who wants to begin ?
FEMALE STUDENT: I heard it was really gnarly . She drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and stuff then she smashed .
PAULINE: Now , now , we 're not here to rehash
PETER: Heather and I used to go together , ut she said I was boring . I realize now I was n't really boring . She was just dissatisfied with her life .
PAULINE: That 's very good Peter .
VERONICA: Heather was cool , but cruel . The good looks and bad manners gave her power , ut it could not give her happiness .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Oh God , it 's so unfair . It 's just so u > unfair ! We should get a whole week off not just an hour .
HEATHER DUKE: Write the School Board .
VERONICA: Watch it , Heather . You could actually e digesting food .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Yeah , where 's your urge to purge ?
HEATHER DUKE: Fuck it .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Look , heather left behind one of he Swatches . She 'd want you to have it , Veronica . She always said you could n't accessorize for shit .
HEATHER DUKE: What a waste .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Veronica , what are you doing ?
SQUEALING GIRL: Everyone in the shower !
MATT: Do I deliver or do I deliver ?
RODNEY: Hurry up , we 're going to get caught .
MATT: Mellow out Geek . Man , I neve should have brought you .
CLYDE: Let 's see some pussy !
MATT: Does this have something to do with menstrual cramps and shit ?
CLYDE: What the fuck ?
RODNEY: We 're on Candid Camera , dudes . I can feel it .
CLYDE: What the fuck ?
STEVE: Do you deliver or do you deliver ?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: That was seriously warped , Veronica .
VERONICA: Uh-huh .
HEATHER DUKE: T.V . cameras !
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Oh God , Veronica . My hair ! My clothes !
VERONICA: Next channel , darling .
FRED DEAN: Hey Dad , how was work today ?
VERONICA: Hello .
DAD: Take a break Veronica , sit down . VERONICA walks into view and sits down .
VERONICA: All right .
DAD: So what was the first day afte Heather 's suicide like ?
VERONICA: I do n't know , it was okay , I guess .
MOM: Terrible thing . So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender ?
VERONICA: Maybe .
DAD: Goddamn . Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things ?
VERONICA: Because you 're an idiot .
DAD: Oh yeah , that 's it .
MOM: You two .
VERONICA: Greate pate , but I 'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready fo the funeral tomorrow .
FATHER RIPPER: It 's Jesus Christ and he 's in the book .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Veronica . What are you doing tonight ?
VERONICA: Mourning . Maybe watch some T.V . Why ?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Ram asked me out , but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt does n't have a date .
VERONICA: Heather , I 've got something going with J.D .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Please Veronica . Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight , I 'll never forget it .
KURT: We on tonight man ?
RAM: I still got to talk to Heather , dude . Weird funeral , huh ?
KURT: Pretty weird .
RAM: Let 's kick his ass .
KURT: Cool off , we 're seniors .
RAM: Goddamn Geek ! BRACES gives them `` the finger '' .
BRACES: Sit and spin .
KURT: That little prick .
BRACES: Cut it out ! RAM pushes BRACES down harder .
KURT: Say it man . Say I like to suck big dicks .
RODNEY: Leave him alone , Kurt .
BRACES: Okay , okay , you like to suck big dicks .
KURT: I 'm sure your friends are happy to hear that . Right , guys ?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Do n't worry , Ram 's been so sweet lately , consoling me and stuff . It 'll be really very . Promise .
VERONICA: All right , but I hope it is n't going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows .
KURT: Is it sleeping , dude ?
RAM: I think so , man .
KURT: Then get over on my side . Oh shit , cowtipping is the fucking greatest .
RAM: Punch it in !
KURT: Count of three , guy .
VERONICA: Yeah , right , asshole .
KURT: `` Feel like making bah da dah bah da dah , feel like making love . ''
VERONICA: So what ? Do n't smile like that , Jesus !
KURT: `` And she 's buying the stairway to heaven.. ''
DENNIS: I 'm not belittling the Famine Fund Peter , but we 're talking teen suicide ! Westerburg finally got one and I 'm not going to blow it .
PETER: Great . Heather gets the headline and I get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon . VERONICA breezes in .
VERONICA: Hi Guys . I came to check on this week 's lunchtime poll topic .
DENNIS: Do n't worry about it , Veronica , sit down . That funeral yesterday must have been really rough .
VERONICA: Oh . Sure .
YEARBOOK GIRL: We were , uh , wondering if maybe you had some poems or artwork that Heather did that we could put in the Heather Chandler yearbook spread ?
VERONICA: The what ?
YEARBOOK GIRL: Take a look . We 'll have a two page layout with her suicide note up here in the right hand corner .
DENNIS: It 's more tasteful than it sounds .
VERONICA: I do n't know . This thing leaves a ad taste in my mouth .
COURTNEY: Like last night , Veronica ?
VERONICA: I 'm sorry ? I do n't get it .
COURTNEY: You did last night . More laughter .
COURTNEY'S FRIEND: Kurt told us of your little date .
VERONICA: Yeah . And ? I left him drunk and flailing in cowshit .
COURTNEY: I do n't know . He was really detailed .
PETER: Shut up , Courtney .
VERONICA: Do n't shut up . I 'd like to know just what I did .
PETER: Let me show you that lunchtime poll topic , Veronica .
VERONICA: Pardon the pun . Son-of-a-bitch .
KURT: Women .
VERONICA: I do n't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we 'll just be shooting them with blanks .
RAM: Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I eve need ! Whoa ! Can you hear me ! Hello Tokyo ! I said Sex and Drugs and
KURT: Shut the fuck up , all right .
RAM: Lighten up , dude . In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we do n't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke . Punch it in ! KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM .
KURT: Hi Veronica .
VERONICA: Hi Guys . Glad you could make it . RAM smacks his hands together .
RAM: So do we just start fucking ?
VERONICA: I 've made a circle on each end of the clearing . Ram , you come over here .
RAM: What about you ?
VERONICA: I was hoping you 'd rip my clothes off me , sport .
RAM: Oh . Good idea .
VERONICA: Count of three , guys . RAM giggles in anticipation .
MILNER: I heard it that time ! McCORD Wha ?
VERONICA: Kurt does n't look too good .
MILNER: Call in !
MILNER: Think what I heard was just a stinking owl . All I got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car . Should I pry them apart ? McCORD Forget it . I got all the answers ack here , partner .
MILNER: What 's the deal ? McCORD Suicide . Double Suicide . They shot each other .
KEVIN STAPLES: After every touchdown or whatever , they give each other a little slap on the bottom . It seems innocent
MRS. POPE: Look at this . `` Ununderstanding . ''
PAULINE: Will you shut up ! We were in a similar position Monday and I thoughtfully suggested that we get the students together for an unadulterated emotional outpouring . You took the suggestion as an opportunity to play yet another round of `` Let 's laugh at the Hippie . ''
COUNSELOR HYDE: Pauline , if you want a tryout for the school play . PRINCIPAL GOWAN hoarsely breaks in .
PRINCIPAL GOWAN: Shut up , Paul . I 've seen a lot of ullshitangel dust , switchblades , sexually perverse photography exhibits involving tennis racquets , ut this suicide thing.I guess it 's all on Pauline 's wavelength . We 're just going to write off today , and Friday she can do her little little love-in or whatever . Whatever .
VERONICA: We killed them , did n't we ?
HEATHER DUKE: Ah , young love . The SQUEALING GIRL bounds up to the Heathers .
SQUEELING GIRL: Did you hear ? School 's cancelled today because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual suicide pact .
HEATHER DUKE: No way !
VERONICA: Sure . Can we make an ice run efore the funeral ?
MR. KELLY: If there 's any way you can hear me , Kurt buddy , I do n't care that you eally were some pansy . You 're my flesh-and-blood . You made me proud . I love my homosexual son . My son 's gay and I love him !
VERONICA: Your son 's dead and you love him .
MOM: How was the funeral ?
VERONICA: Superb .
PAULINE: Peter , kill the jukebox .
PAULINE: Yo , what 's the problem ? I know you know how to hold hands . Ring-around- the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posyForget it ! I 'm just so thrilled to announce that Whitney James of WETC News is taping a ap session with students from area high schools including Westerburg .
STUDENTS: Hell no !
PAULINE: I ca n't hear you .
STUDENTS: HELL NO !
VERONICA: Ca n't you see this is a special moment ?
PAULINE: You people are in charge of getting delegates from every clique in the school to be on the Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V . Special . Let 's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture .
PETER: Westerburg ? A happy family ?
PAULINE: I 'm sure you 'll work something out .
HEATHER DUKE: Do n't worry . We 'll work something out .
VERONICA: Yes . Yes . We 'll work something out . I swear to God . Wo n't we J.D. ? J.D . ?
FRED DEAN: We beat the bitches .
VERONICA: Oh beautiful . The Beaver 's home .
FRED DEAN: Judge told em to slurp shit and die .
VERONICA: Do you like your father ?
VERONICA: We 're breaking up . I am out !
HEATHER DUKE: What the..
EARL: Let me get it clear , Veronica . You want yourself a sweet homeboy fo this T.V . show so you can show everybody what a loose , Martin Luthe Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is .
VERONICA: Something like that . Will you do it ?
EARL: Damn , you 're a shrewd one . Shrewd .
VERONICA: I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it does n't have to be Vietnam . You do n't get treated badly here do you ?
EARL: I do n't get treated at all , but hey , do n't worry about it . I 'll do you thing . It 'll give my Mom a smile . VERONICA hands him a Guest Pass tag .
VERONICA: Things are going to change , Earl .
EARL: Uh-huh .
HEATHER DUKE: Guess who ?
VERONICA: Heather .
DAVID: Hey Veronica Sawyer , barf on anybody 's carpet lately ?
VERONICA: Is this David ? Heather 's David ? What are you doing .
DAVID: What can I say ? I was pretty broken up by Heather C. 's suicide . I needed somebody super-sensitive like Heather D .
VERONICA: I 'm delirious for the both of you . Can you put Heather on ?
DAVID: She ca n't really talk right now .
VERONICA: Hello , Betty..
BETTY: I do n't believe it . I 'm winning .
VERONICA: Do n't get cocky , girl .
BETTY: I missed you . I know I 'm not as , as exciting as your other friends .
VERONICA: That 's bullshit . Just shoot . BETTY once again bends and raises .
BETTY: Ronnie , I 'm still a virgin .
VERONICA: Shoot . BETTY finally shoots . Feebly .
BETTY: Ronnie !
VERONICA: It 's not my style , okay ?
BETTY: Nice guys finish last . I should know .
HEATHER DUKE: Brav-o !
BETTY FINN: I 've got to get going , Veronica . See you at the studio .
VERONICA: Sure . See ya .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Croquet wo n't be the same without Heather .
HEATHER DUKE: Oh Betty , wait . I almost forgotThe Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V . Special is n't going to be taped at the studios . It 's going to be done in the Park .
BETTY: But I thought
HEATHER DUKE: It 's going to be like a big picnic . Bring some potato saladHEY , I 'M RED !
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Shit .
VERONICA: So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight ?
HEATHER DUKE: Back off . I called everyone , even that Stoner slut . Felt like giving my phone a bath . I told Betty just nowDamn !
VERONICA: You 're so polluted . Talking down to people , making fake notes . VERONICA blows her shot .
HEATHER DUKE: I do n't see what gives you the right to lecture , Ronnie . You were soulmates with Betty Finn until you ealized you 're the cover of Seventeen magazine and she 's the efore half of a Scarsdale Diet ad .
VERONICA: No , you 're wrong . It 's not even your turn .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: She 's right..Boy , croquet 's not the same without Heather .
VERONICA: Ich Luge bullets . I 'm such a jerk .
PETER DAWSON: Veronica , I thought we lost you .
VERONICA: I was waiting for my friend Betty .
PETER DAWSON: Teens talking it out on T.V. ! Would it be pretentious of me to attach a videocassette of the show on my Princeton application ?
VERONICA: Shucks , that 's a great idea , Pete . They burst through the studio double doors .
PETER DAWSON: This is excellent , but I thought we were going to get equal representation on this thind Geeks , Gearheads
HEATHER DUKE: They 're probably just being fashionably late .
WHITNEY JAMES: Ah please sit down .
VERONICA: But my name 's not
WHITNEY JAMES: People just do n't take the name Heathe seriously . They should , should n't they ?
VERONICA: I 'm so sorry . I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering .
WHITNEY JAMES: Oh , I was scared of the same thing , Heather . The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you 're stepping into quicksand . Quicksand filled with bad complexions , bad grades , ad parents , bad drugs , and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone end down to clean up .
CLYDE: What the fuck ?
VERONICA: The world wants winners , I guess . Not people stained with loserness .
WHITNEY JAMES: Stained with loserness . Oh , I like it . Can I use that . It 'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda .
VERONICA: It 's all yours , Heather . Now if you 'll excuse me , I 'm going to go throw up .
WHITNEY JAMES: Sure . Ciao .
PAULINE: Everyone take their places on the stage ! Is n't this thrilling ? !
VERONICA: But Ms. Fleming , it 's just not right .
PAULINE: What , the wine ? I realize you 're all under 21 , but it seemed like such a perfect touch . Could we get some more light up here ?
PAULINE: Our schools have been torn apart by tragedy . Let 's fuse them back togethe through love . Let 's clasp hands and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove .
STUDENTS: Oh yeah
PAULINE: No more problems .
VERONICA: Oh yeah .
WHITNEY JAMES: Let 's go for another take .
CASHIER: Bargain matinees are for the first show only .
MARTHA: Oh , I forgot .
DAD: Hey Veronica , how 'd that Teenage Prevention T.V . Suicide thing go ?
VERONICA: Color me educated . I learned high school happiness is for members only , Pauline Fleming would n't know reality if it lived in her uterus , and reality 's name 's Heather James . Also , J.D . 's a major creep .
MOM: I do n't know what you 're talking about , honey , but can it wait a bit . We 're watching this special program on Teen Problems . VERONICA half-bitterly laughs at the irony .
VERONICA: This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do . Hey kids , make your parents and teachers feel like shit ! Get the respect in death you 'll never get in life .
DAD: If we 're not going to watch that program , can I put on the game ?
MOM: Are you trying to tell me it is not < /u a troubled time for the nation 's youth ?
VERONICA: Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow . When that news eporter gets home he 'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the ight pattern .
MOM: I 'm lost . You do n't get enough attention , you get too much attention . Which is it ? Where are your shoes ?
VERONICA: All we want is to be treated like human beings , not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like unny rabbits to be patronized .
DAD: I do n't patronize bunny rabbits .
MOM: Treated like human beings ? Is that what you said little Miss Voice of a Generation ? Just how do you think adults act with other adults ? You think it 's all just Doubles Tennis . Adults can be horrible to other adults . When teenagers complain that they want to be treated like human beings , it 's usually because they are being treated like human beings .
VERONICA: I guess I picked the wrong time to e a human being .
MOM: You 'll live . Want some pate ? HEATHER DUKE suddenly breezes in the room .
HEATHER DUKE: Hi everyone , door was open . Veronica , you missed it ! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm . She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then ellyflopped in front of a car .
VERONICA: Is she dead ?
HEATHER DUKE: That 's the punchline . She 's still alive , in stable condition . Anothe case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably . Is that pate ? VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE in the face .
VERONICA: I said I was sorry .
HEATHER DUKE: You are out of control . Heather and Kurt were a shock , but Martha Dumptruck , get crucial ! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers .
VERONICA: You 're not funny . Ouch !
HEATHER DUKE: What . A. Martyr . Understand ; Martha could n't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen . Just think what a better place the world would e if every nimrod followed her cue .
VERONICA: Just shut up and turn on the radio . Hot Probs is on .
HEATHER DUKE: Oh shit , yeah .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: My name is Heather , I mean , not Heather .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: God has cursed me , I think . The last time I had sex , the guy killed himself the next day . I 'm failing Math .

HEATHER MCNAMARA: Fucking child protector caps .
GRUFF TEACHER: Now where 's she going ? Is somebody getting aped today on All My Children or what ?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Give me a break .
VERONICA: What were you trying to do ? Sleep ?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Suicide is a private thing .
VERONICA: You 're giving your life away to ecome a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today . That 's got to be the least private thing I can think of .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt ?
VERONICA: If everyone jumped off a bridge , young lady , would you ?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Probably .
VERONICA: Hey now , if you were happy every day of your life , you would n't be a human eing , you 'd be a game show host .
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Let 's knock off early . Go to the mall . Something lame like that .

HEATHER DUKE: Veronica ! Color me stoked , girl . I 've gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags . People love me ! My God , you have n't signed !
VERONICA: People love you but I know you . Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria . And Doug Hylton
HEATHER DUKE: So some people need different kinds of `` convincing '' than others . Hey , just sign the petition !
VERONICA: Do n't talk to me like that .
HEATHER DUKE: It was J.D . 's idea ! He made out the signature sheet and everything . Now will you sign it ?
VERONICA: No .
HEATHER DUKE: Jealous much ?
VERONICA: Heather , why ca n't you just be a friend ? Why are you such a MegaBitch ?
HEATHER DUKE: Because I can be ! The same fucking cheek , goddamnit ! Why are you pulling my dick ? Do you think , do you really think , if Betty Finn 's fairy godmother made her < /u Cool , she 'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends ? No way ! Uh-Uh !
VERONICA: I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke 's wrists open and making it look like a suicide .
MOM: Your friend Jason Dean just stopped y . He seemed very concerned about you . He said he thinks you might try to kill yourself .
DAD: You have been depressed lately . Oh , he said this is for you .
VERONICA: Oh my God .
VERONICA: Get off my bed , you sick psycho ! You think you 're a rebel ! You 're not a rebel ! You 're a sick psycho ! Do you think you 're a rebel ? Do you think you 're a rebel ? I wan na know !

VERONICA: Rodney , where 's everybody going ?
RODNEY: It 's Friday..
VERONICA: Oh my God , the damn pep assembly .
RODNEY: Yeah , these things are pretty artificial , ut at least we all get out of class
VERONICA: Rodney , what 's underneath the gym ?
RODNEY: The boiler room .
VERONICA: Like father , like son . A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that 'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs . Okay , so let 's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground .
VERONICA: The bomb 's gone on , J.D. ! How do you turn it off ? Tell me !
HEATHER DUKE: Veronica , you look like hell .

SANTA: What are you fucking midgets looking at ! ? Get back to work ! We have Hanukkah to destroy !
CHIEF: Gentleman ! His pleas for silence are ignored .
HALL: Hey !
CHIEF: The time for action is now . We predict that the St. Nick Day Massacre will put Hanukkah-Christmas relations back at least a hundred years . With this meshuggena new Santa Claus in power , Hanukkah is in jeopardy . Our first orde of business is to put into motion a plan to create goodwill towards the Jewish Community . Mr. Chairman of the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy .
HARVEY WEINSTEIN: Yes Chief .
CHIEF: We need your people to crank out a couple more award winning documentaries on the Holocaust , possibly a new Adam Sandle movie .
ADL CHAIRMAN: Not another Adam Sandler movie !
HARVEY WEINSTEIN: What 's wrong with Adam Sandler movies ?
ADL CHAIRMAN: We 're trying to create goodwill here . I just think
HARVEY WEINSTEIN: Frankly , I do n't care what you think . I think you 're a putz .
ADL CHAIRMAN: Do n't defame me . I 'm against that .
CHIEF: Focus people . Our next order of business is to assign an agent to track Santa 's activities . Step in and use force if the situation calls for it . We need to put the toughest Jew we have on the case . Suggestions ? Suggestions , anybody ? One of the JDL MEMBERS calls out .
ADL CHAIRMAN: Joe Lieberman ?
CHIEF: Missing in action .
HARVEY WEINSTEIN: David Copperfield ?
CHIEF: What 's he gon na do , make Santa disappear ? Think people think . We need a hard hittin ' Hebe on this one .
ESTHER: What about Mordechai Jefferson Carver ?
CHIEF: The Hebrew Hammer ? No . No way . After the way he handled that situation in the West Bank ? He 's the only Jew in the world too extreme for the JDL . There 's a reason why we kicked him out of our ranks , sweetheart . We need a man who can follow orders . A man with self-control . We need a man
COUNCIL ELDER: We need a man who can get the jo done .
ESTHER: Daddy , he 's our only hope . And you know it . The Chief nods his head reluctantly .
ADL CHAIRMAN: Only problem is , ever since we kicked him out , he wants nothing to do with us . There 's no way we can persuade him to come back . Esther lifts her skirt a few inches .
ESTHER: Perhaps I can persuade him .
HAMMER: Please , call me Mordechai .
ESTHER: Sorry I 'm late . Traffic was a pisher , and I 've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking . What are you listening to ?
HAMMER: How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal ? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on ?
ESTHER: Actually , his days of marital infidelity have long since past . Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively . The Hammer makes the realization .
HAMMER: Your mother ? Oh . Whoops .
ESTHER: Mordechai , Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian . The man 's a demon . There 's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of .
HAMMER: I 'm sorry to hear about Santa . He was a good friend , but my days
BLONDE BOMBSHELL: Mr. Hammer ? I 'd like to hire you to put a tail on my husband . I think my life might e in danger . I think he wants to kill me .
HAMMER: Sorry Shiksa , I think you got the wrong office . I 'm the Hebrew Hammer . Mike Hammer 's down the hall .
BLONDE BOMBSHELL: Oh . She leaves .
HAMMER: Listen . Esther , you seem like a nice girl , so I 'm only gon na say this once . I no longer affiliate myself with that organization . The politics there were utal . Besides , I 've already got a full case load . Esther looks down at his desk .
ESTHER: Why are you being so difficult ? All my father wants is to just speak with
HAMMER: I hate to cut you short , but in an hou the sun goes down , and then it 's officially the Sabbath . I ca n't work on the Sabbath . This is where we 're going to have to part ways boobola .
ESTHER: I 'm not leaving your side until I get you to agree to come speak with my father .
HAMMER: Be my guest . But I have to warn you , I 'm going to my mother 's for dinner tonight . And if you think I 'm difficult , wait till you meet her .
ESTHER: Before we leave , there 's just one more thing . I noticed that the sign on you door says you 're a certified circumcised dick . Would you mind if I asked to see your credentials ?
MRS. CARVER: Mordechai ! Shabat Shalom !
HAMMER: Shabat Shalom mama . I brought some Manischewitz . The black label .
MRS. CARVER: I can see . And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us .
ESTHER: It 's Esther .
MRS. CARVER: From the story of Purim . Well , now that we 're all acquainted , let 's sit down and start the Sabbath .
HAMMER: Oy vey , I 'm stuffed .
ESTHER: I do n't think I could eat another latke if you paid me .
MRS. CARVER: Everybody ready for the main course ? Esther and the Hammer exchange looks .
HAMMER: Mom , I think we 've had enough .
MRS. CARVER: Nonsense young man . You 'll eat everything in front of you . After all , there are people starving in China . Is n't that ight Mun Chi ?
HAMMER: Mom ! Esther works for the JDL . They sent her to try and recruit me back to save Hanukkah for them . What she does n't seem to understand is that nothing , not even god himself could convince me to eve work for them again .
ESTHER: But Hanukkah 's in dan The Hammer cuts her off .
HAMMER: Not my problem . If you 'll excuse me now , I need to use the bathroom . He stands and leaves . Mrs . Carver stares lovingly at Esther .
MRS. CARVER: You like my Mordechai , yes ?
ESTHER: He'she 's very nice . But Mrs . Carver , the fate of Hanukkah ests solely in his hands . Please , you have to help me .
MRS. CARVER: Hanukkah , Shmanukkah . It is n't even one of the high holidays . What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty , and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl . I 'll make you a deal . I 'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai .
ESTHER: What do you want me to do ?
MRS. CARVER: He works too much . God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while . Take his mind off his work . Maybe a blowjob here and there . Esther begins to choke again .
HAMMER: Mom , where do you keep the plunger ?
MRS. CARVER: It 's under the sink by my tampons ! Esther appears panicked .
ESTHER: Deal . The Hammer sits down .
HAMMER: So , what did you two ladies discuss while I was gone .
MRS. CARVER: I was just telling your nice friend Esther about how I used to have such a problem with the gas . So , once I started taking two charcoal pills before I ate , the gas cleared itself right up . Esther plays along .
ESTHER: Thanks . That'sgood to know .
MRS. CARVER: Mordechai . Do you love your mother ?
HAMMER: Mom , stop with this already . Of course I love you . You 're my mother .
MRS. CARVER: Then how come you wo n't stop this Certified Circumcised Dick nonsense and get yourself a real job .
HAMMER: Mom , I have a real job . I do good things for this community . I help people .
MRS. CARVER: When I play bridge with all the girls , everyone has what to talk about with their sons . They show pictures . Thei sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis . Why ca n't I show a picture ?
HAMMER: So do n't show a picture .
MRS. CARVER: You know my friend Maureen ? Her son , the investment banker ? He paid for her entire etirement in Boca Raton . What a mench he is . Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah , god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA . Maybe then you could send me to Boca , too . This puts the Hammer into a neurotic fit .
HAMMER: Oh . Oh , What . So , all of a sudden my saving Hanukkah 's not good enough fo you ? Is that what your saying ?
MRS. CARVER: I do n't want to argue with you . Let 's just eat in peace .
HAMMER: No . No . We 're gon na argue . And you know what mom ? I 'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you . And when my face is all over the television . When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year , do n't mention it to them , okay ? I would n't want you to have to show my picture .
MRS. CARVER: Do what you must . Mrs . Carver looks at Esther and winks .
HAMMER: Mom , why do n't you put that cat out of its misery ?
MRS. CARVER: Because it is n't god 's way . When you spent the fourth grade in bed ecovering from your bout with hypoglycemia , did I put you down ? No . Mazel Tov will lead a full life just like the rest of us . Is n't that right Mazel Tov ?
COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Jew Confirmation Test initiated . He 's clearly irritated by this .
HAMMER: You 've got ta be kidding me . They 're still doing this ?

CHIEF: Come on . Come on .
HAMMER: A minion practicing Jew-do , the deadly fighting art . Cool .
CHIEF: There 's more . Follow me .
HAMMER: Alright . I 'll , uh , keep doing that . Sammy 's all smiles .
CHIEF: Sammy , if you 'll excuse us , Mordechai and I have business to attend to .
HAMMER: I got the job done did n't I ? I did what I had to do .
CHIEF: A settlement completely demolished , ten smashed army jeeps , four dead Arabs . G dash D damn it , Hammer ! You think you 're above the Ten Commandments ? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us . No heroics , got it ?
HAMMER: Hey , it 's your Bar Mitzvah . I 'm just eadin ' the Torah portion .
CHIEF: Well it 's good to see that you can be so nonchalant about the whole thing .
HAMMER: I guess I could be chalant about it , but then again I 'm not even sure if that 's a word . Listen Chief , we could stand around arguing all day , but I got ta case to crack .
CHIEF: What 's your first move ?
HAMMER: I 'm gon na pay a visit to the K.L.F . See if they 've got the 411 on Santa 's location . I 'll check in with you when I know more . The Hammer heads for the door .
CHIEF: You be careful Hammer .
HAMMER: Okay . You guys have seriously got to stop with that stuff . That 's a lot of pressure to put on one Jew . I 'm only human you know . I 'm already shvitzing about the whole thing . You know , believe it or not , I 'm allowed to make mistakes , too . I can only do the best that I can do , and that 's just gon na have to be good enough for all of you . A reaction shot of the befuddled Chief .

HAMMER: Is there anything else you can tell me ? His hangouts , his next move , anything ? Jamal thinks for a second .
JAMAL: Well , come to think of it , there is one thing . Before I left , I was packin ' up my shit and I overheard the nigga talkin ' to some business pahtnah or something . Sayin that he 'd meet him today at some joint called Duke 's . Round five o'clock if my memory serves . When he got off the phone and jetted , I scoped the room for some jewelry , cash , whatevers . You know , a severance package . Did n't find any duckets , but I did snatch this .
HAMMER: Thanks little brother , you 've been a big help .
JAMAL: Shit fool , ai n't no thang . If it was n't for my real brothers here at the K.L.F. , I 'd be shining shoes at the train station or getting my afro tossed up against a velcro wall in some redneck ba somewhere . I finally gots a place where I elong . Fuck Christmas . I 'm all about smoking blunts and pimpin ' bitches . I 'm all about Kwanzaa nigga !
MOHAMMED: He 's new . He 's still got a long way to go efore he understands the true meaning of Kwanzaa .
HAMMER: Thanks again Mo , you always deliver the goods .
MOHAMMED: You watch your back Hammer . Hanukkah might just be his first move . For all we know Kwanzaa could be next . There 's a lot of brothers counting on you . If you fail

SANTA: Excellent . Everything is going as planned .
JAMAL: Pfff . Shit nigga , ai n't no thang . Hey , yo Santy Claus , so does this mean that you gon na make me an official elf now ?
SANTA: Can you believe this guy Tiny Tim ?
JAMAL: That 's some cold shit .
HEAD ELF: Utopian model of efficiency my ass ! Eve since you took charge , this place has een more like a sweatshop .
SANTA: You know something , you 're right .
HEAD ELF: Really ?
SANTA: Yeah . This is a sweatshop . And since you elves are n't willing to do the work , I made arrangements to have some Taiwanese children shipped over . And I might add , they 're more than willing to work fo peanuts . Santa performs the two fingered whistle .
TINY TIM: So , what 's our first plan of attack Santa ?
SANTA: While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems , I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive , Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet . I bought the entire plant .
TINY TIM: What should I charge ?
SANTA: Oh , that 's the beauty of it . These are free samples . Tiny Tim 's curiosity is peaked .
TINY TIM: So what 's in the boxes ? Heroin ? Cocaine ?
SANTA: Worse .
TINY TIM: That 's some cold shit .
HAMMER: Manischewitz . Straight up .
SKINHEAD BARTENDER: Usually we do n't serve your kind . But since you had the balls to walk in here , Kike , I 'll pour you one last drink before we lynch you .
HAMMER: Actually , can I have the black label ?
SKINHEAD BARTENDER: Be my guest .
HAMMER: Do you guys take Shekels ? I just got back from a trip in Israel , and all I 've got is a fistful of Shekels . He drops a fistful of Shekels on the bar .
TELEVISION SET: Papa , Papa ! Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings ! A JEWISH MOTHER calls to her son from O.S .
HAMMER: Shlomo , you okay ?
SHLOMO: Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing , an angel gets his wings !
HAMMER: Huh .
SHLOMO: Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing , an angel gets his wings !
HAMMER: Bootleg 'It 's A Wonderful Life ' from Taiwan .
SHLOMO: Chaim Potok 's The Chosen ?
HAMMER: Get yourself home and watch this as soon as possible .
SHLOMO: Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing , an angel gets his wings ! The Hammer slaps him out of his spell .
HAMMER: Hey , hey , hey ! You can beat this . Now get going .
CHIEF: You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl , Fiddler On The Roof , and Chaim Potok 's The Chosen ?
HAMMER: That 'll work . Get them out to the Jewish community stat . We got an epidemic on ou hands .
CHIEF: We 're on it Hammer . How 'd you do with Santa ?
HAMMER: It was a trap . I 'm back at square one .
CHIEF: Well , then I 've got good news for you . We just got word that he 'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today . I 'm sending Esther to meet you there at once .
HAMMER: Good thinking . We 'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected . Now that he thinks I 'm dead , this should e a piece of homentashen .
CHIEF: One last thing Hammer . You take care of yourself . The
HAMMER: The fate of Hanukkah . Right . Right . Yeah , Got it . Will do . Okay , bye now . He hangs up and leaves .
TINY TIM: One partridge in a pear tree to two turtle doves . What 's your status ?
TONY: Nothing stirring here .
ESTHER: Any sign of Santa ?
HAMMER: He must be behind that curtain . Relax . We 're undercover . We need to give off the appearance of calm . You see Esther , the trick to undercover work is to try and lend in . Act as a Gentile would .
SAMPLES WOMAN: Could I interest you in a free sample acon cheeseburger ?
HAMMER: While I thank you , Gentile friend , fo your generous offer of that deliciously unkosher snack , I sadly have to decline for I stuffed myself full of meat and milk product at a prior lunch engagement .
ESTHER: You 're good .
TONY: Can I have everyone 's attention please . In fifteen minutes , Santa 's gon na have to leave . The kids all vocalize their disappointment .
ESTHER: What are we going to do ? We 're at least an hour from the front .
HAMMER: C'mon follow me .
ESTHER: Is that ? No , could n't be .
TONY: Hey , hey ! Not so fast .
HAMMER: We have to get through . It 's an emergency .
TONY: Sorry pal , you 're gon na have to wait in line just like all the other parents .
ESTHER: We 're so sorry to have to cut , but ou eautiful Gentile boy ran on ahead of us in line .
TONY: Wellumm , when you put it that way . Sure go on through .
HAMMER: You 're good !
SANTA: And what do the Jewish people do during Hanukkah ?
JIMMY: They worship the devil and sacrifice small Gentile children like me in izarre , sadistic rituals .
SANTA: That 's right . Santa can tell that you 've een a very good boy this year . Run along now Jimmy .
HAMMER: If you keep your mouth shut and come with me , you wo n't get hurt .
SANTA: Excuse me ? Do I know you , friend ? Take a look around you . Do you even know who I am ?
HAMMER: Let me guess , you 're the goy who stole Hanukkah .
SANTA: The Hebrew Hammer ! You 're alive .
HAMMER: What 's your shpiel , Santa ?
SANTA: Whoa , whoa there . C'mon Mordechai , is this any way to treat an old family friend ? Let 's cut out all the unpleasantness . I admit , I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing . Let me make it up to you . How about a peace offering ? Girls .
BAMBI: Oh , I declare I just love Jewish men . They 're so sensitive and well read . Esther is clearly jealous .
HAMMER: Sorry Santa . I like my women like my matzah . Unleavened .
TONY: Hey , hurry it up in there . We got ta bunch of kids
ESTHER: Back it up buddy !
MC HAMMER: Please Hammer , do n't hurt em ' !
HAMMER: Let 's do this clean . I do n't want to make a scene Santa . Santa stands up slowly with his hands raised .
SANTA: Well , it 's a bit too late for that now , is n't it ? Excuse me children , if I could have your attention for a moment .
HAMMER: What are you doing ?
SANTA: I 'm just calming the kiddies . There 's no need to worry about Santa . He 's just having a peaceful , adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend , The Hebrew Hammer .
HAMMER: Hey everybody . How 's it hangin ' ?
SANTA: In fact , he 's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year .
HAMMER: C'mon !
ESTHER: Shh . Shh , listen . Do you hear that ? The Hammer tries to place the source .
HAMMER: What is that ?
HARRIET TUBBELMAN: Psst . Hammer , Esther . This way . Hurry !
HAMMER: You saved our lives . Thank you . How can I ever repay you ?
HARRIET TUBBELMAN: My name is Harriet Tubbelman , but you can call me Moses . The only payment I ask Mordechai , is that you keep Hanukkah safe for us all .
HAMMER: Where are we ? What is this place ? She smiles with great pride .
HARRIET TUBBELMAN: Welcome to the Underground Jewish Railroad . Just sit back , relax , and enjoy the ride .
HAMMER: That got annoying fairly quickly .
ESTHER: Yeah , no kidding .
CARNIVAL WORKER: Tickets please .
HAMMER: Nah , we 're kosher . Thanks though .
ESTHER: So , now what ?
HAMMER: Now we wait for Santa to make his next move . He gives her a once over . She is stunning .
ESTHER: Sure . Why not .
BANDLEADER: Hey ! The Hebrew Hammer everybody !
ESTHER: So , do you come here often ! ?
HAMMER: What was that ! ?
ESTHER: I said , do you come here often ! ?
HAMMER: Oh . Yeah , about once a week !
ESTHER: What ! ?
HAMMER: I said , yeah , about once a week !
ESTHER: Oh !
HAMMER: I 'm okay right now . Thanks though .
JOSHUA: Hey Morty , wan na cut a rug ?
HAMMER: Nah , I 'm good . I 'm kind of here with somebody .
JOSHUA: Oh . Okay . Maybe next time .
HAMMER: Yeah . Maybe next time Joshua . Take it easy .
CHAIM FEYGELE: Well Shalom there mister !
HAMMER: Do we know each other ?
CHAIM FEYGELE: No , but we have mutual friends .
HAMMER: Mordechai . My friends call me Morty .
CHAIM FEYGELE: So Morty , I just love a man in a black suit . Care to dance . Mordechai is flustered .
HAMMER: Uhhh . You know , Ihave to go to the athroom . I 'll be right back . The Hammer gets up quickly and leaves .
ESTHER: Hey .
HAMMER: Do you want to get out of here ? She looks relieved .
ESTHER: I would love to get out of here .
HAMMER: Sorry . I 'm better with men .
ESTHER: Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing .
HAMMER: You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chickeOh . I get it .
ESTHER: Mordechai ?
HAMMER: Yes Esther .
ESTHER: I want you to talk dirty to me .
HAMMER: Oh . Okay . He thinks for a moment .
ESTHER: Keep going .
HAMMER: Afterwards they 'll make the decision as to whether or not they 'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel . Because , hey , after all we 'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing , sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism . She 's on fire for him .
ESTHER: Oh god , yes ! Keep going ! Do n't stop !
HAMMER: Also , on a daily basis , I want you to tell me what to do , where to do it , and how I should live my life .
ESTHER: Kiss me you Semitic stud ! She grabs him and kisses him passionately .
HAMMER: Antihistamine . It 's for my allergies . The capsules make me gassy . She relaxes .
ESTHER: Your mother was right . You do work too hard .
HAMMER: Oh , she said that , did she ? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say ?
ESTHER: Well , she also said that you need to find a nice girl to help take your mind off of your work . I 'm just glad she thought I was good enough for you . The Hammer sits up .
HAMMER: When did you guys have this conversation ? When I was in the bathroom ? What else did she have to say ?
ESTHER: Relax Morty , I think your mom is wonderful . She cares so much about you . Get this , while you were gone she said she 'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I 'd come eat by you once in awhile . Like I needed any incentive to be with you . She 's so The Hammer goes into a fit .
HAMMER: What ? You made a deal with my mother to sleep with me if I 'd help you ? !
ESTHER: No . Of course
HAMMER: What does that make you ? What does that make me ? And my mother . What does that make her ? He makes a realization .
ESTHER: No . It 's not like that . You 're being completely neurotic . I was just playing along He thinks aloud .
HAMMER: Always meddling in my life . This is so typical of her . But from you ? I thought we had something good here .
ESTHER: We do !
HAMMER: I 'm sorry Esther , I just do n't think we can see each other romantically anymore . The phone RINGS , and the Hammer picks it up .
CHIEF: Hammer , it 's the Chief . We 've got ourselves a situation . Get yourself down here , I 've got something you need to see .
HAMMER: What 's up ?
CHIEF: About an hour ago , we received this transmission from the North Pole .
SANTA: And now my Hanukkah loving friends , I will reveal to you the true nature of my diabolical scheme .
TINY TIM: Merry Christmas everybody , and god bless us , everyone . The two laugh hysterically .
SANTA: End transmission .
TINY TIM: It was good . Very chilling , but you still got all the points across that we talked about .
SANTA: Really ? Good , good .
TINY TIM: No , it was the perfect level .
SANTA: Thanks . Oh , did I tell you . I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended . You were right , it is good .
HAMMER: Looks like I got a plane to catch .
CHIEF: Take Esther with you , you 'll need the ackup .
HAMMER: No way , it 's too dangerous . Besides , my days of hooking are over .
ESTHER: You 're not my bitch Mordechai . Please , you have to believe me .
CHIEF: Did I miss something here ?
HAMMER: It 's a long story . I 'll explain when I get back from saving the clock . He turns his attention to Esther .
CHIEF: Tail him . He 's gon na need the help .
HAMMER: Do you speak English ?
HEAD ELF: Go , go , go ! The Head Elf jumps out , and out of frame .
ELF FLUNKY: Not sure . I think it was left over from an Israeli Robbie Kneivel television special . You want me to get rid of it ?
HEAD ELF: No time . Besides , it 's not like someone 's gon na jump their motorcycle into the uilding while we 're inside . The HEAD THUG ELF points up towards the sky .
TINY TIM: You okay ?
SANTA: No . I 'm airsick you asshole ! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly ?
TINY TIM: I do n't know . Why do n't you ask them sir . Santa takes this in .
SANTA: Who 's the leader of this operation ?
TINY TIM: Uh , he ca n't sir . The harnesses .
SANTA: You gon na learn to guide this sled right ? You gon na make sure your men follow suit ? Because if I 'm puking down chimneys come Christmas Eve , I 'm gon na have your hide . We clear ?
HAMMER: Uh . Can you just give me one second ? Santa is confused .
SANTA: Get him boys !
ESTHER: Mordechai ! Behind you !
HAMMER: What are you doing here ?
ESTHER: Mordechai , I love you . I could n't let you do this alone .
HAMMER: I love you too . I 'm sorry about freaking out yesterday . I was wrong .
ESTHER: I forgive you .
HAMMER: Go check on the clock . I 'll finish up here .
TINY TIM: Uh oh . The Hammer begins firing .
SANTA: Get off of me you cripple !
TINY TIM: What are we gon na do ? He 's got us on the opes .
ESTHER: What 's the matter ?
HAMMER: I do n't know . I 'm feeling kind of tired .
SANTA: What 's going on ? Why 'd he stop ?
TINY TIM: Maybe he ran out of ammo .
SANTA: Take a look .
TINY TIM: Well , he 's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend .
SANTA: Resting ? He thinks for a second . An idea forms .
TINY TIM: It 's Friday .
SANTA: What time is it ?
TINY TIM: I do n't know . About sundown I guess . Santa makes the connection .
SANTA: Why did n't I think of this ? It 's the Sabbath . A blank look from Tiny Tim .
TINY TIM: You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever , buy him clothing he 'll never wear , and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy was n't looking ?
SANTA: No dipshit , I want you to kill him . He thinks about it .
TINY TIM: Oh .
SANTA: Santa 's gon na take the sled back to the North Pole and celebrate his victory with his new stocking stuffer .
HAMMER: Esther !
ESTHER: Mordechai !
TINY TIM: Take a look Hammer . The clock 's already eginning to power down .
JAMAL: Merry Kwanzaa nigga !
CHIEF: Mordechai , you 're back . The clock ?
HAMMER: Still ticking . Thanks to the help from the Brothers at the KLF , Hanukkah 's safe for now .
CHIEF: That 's wonderful ! The Chief notices the Hammer 's dejected look .
HAMMER: It 's Esther . Santa 's got her .
CHIEF: My Esther ! Oh Mordechai .
HAMMER: I love her sir . If I do n't help you , I wo n't be able to make her my wife . Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a escue mission .
MOHAMMED: Asalam Alekem .
CHIEF: You 're a mench . Thank you . Mordechai , by any means necessary , you ing my Esther back to me . Even if it equires using Judaism 's most powerful weapon .
HAMMER: Oh no , not the The Chief shakes his head yes .
CHIEF: Hammer , the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands .
HAMMER: I know sir . I wo n't let you down .
MOHAMMED: What 's wrong with him ?
HAMMER: He 's still working out some identity issues .
MOHAMMED: I wanted to ask you , how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa 's workshop ? We 've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years . The Hammer puts the binoculars down .
HAMMER: This is the year 5734 . It 's time the boys at the KLF got into the 58th century . Let me show you something . The Hammer pulls out a LAPTOP COMPUTER .
MOHAMMED: Cool . What 's it do ?
HAMMER: Now this might get a bit technical , but try and stay with me . Using a highly sophisticated connection of othe computators , called the Internet , I can access surveillance maps , villian iographical information , and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter .
MOHAMMED: Man , that 's far out ! Hey , the Jets won !
HAMMER: But wait , there 's more . With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface , commonly referred to as a mouse , I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail . Mo 's interest is seriously peaked .
MOHAMMED: Porno ? You 're tellin ' me that you can get porno on that thing ?
HAMMER: Oh yeah . Take a look . The Hammer does some computing .
MOHAMMED: Gettin ' freaky with a what ?
HAMMER: Remember that bit about the cyber postal oute ?
MOHAMMED: Yeah .
HAMMER: Nah , forget about it .
SANTA: Rudolph , more egg nog !
TINY TIM: Santa , I got some really bad news .
MOHAMMED: What are you doing ?
HAMMER: Just praying to god that we do n't kill ourselves going over this wall .
MOHAMMED: I knew that .
MOHAMMED: Well , that was easy .
HAMMER: Wait ! Before we enter , you need to know that my research has determined that Santa 's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system .
MOHAMMED: A stereo type alarm system ?
HAMMER: Take a look .
MOHAMMED: How do we bypass it ?
HAMMER: The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P . tendencies inside the building . For example , if you were to dribble a basketball , or eat watermelon , or use the word dawgthat is , spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter owithin the confines of this workshop , the alarm would sound . This pisses Mo off .
MOHAMMED: Listen cat , I 'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player .
HAMMER: Well that 's good news for us . It means the system is outdated . This should be easy . C'mon . The two enter through the door .
MOHAMMED: It 's all clear . Let 's go . The Hammer bends down to pick up the change .
HAMMER: Mo , I think you dropped some Mo 's eyes widen in terror .
MOHAMMED: Hammer , no !
LOUDSPEAKERS: Jewdar alert ! Jewdar alert !
HAMMER: Let 's go !
MOHAMMED: What are you doing ?
HAMMER: Offscreen gunfire . That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget .
MOHAMMED: There 's Tiny Tim .
SANTA: Hey , what 's that over there ? Is that a owl of Matzah Ball soup ?
HAMMER: Damn ! He takes off down the hall after Santa .
MOHAMMED: Now I 'm gon na do to you what I should have done earlier .
TINY TIM: My crutches . Noooo . Not my crutches .
HAMMER: Where 's my girlfriend Santa ?
SANTA: I do n't have to tell you anything Hammer ! You 're gon na have to kill me before I tell you ! The Hammer 's confused .
HAMMER: But if I kill you , then you 'll be dead . Santa thinks about this for a couple seconds .
SANTA: Good point .
HAMMER: Do n't worry your pretty little head .
SANTA: Looks like the tables have turned once again Hammer . More screaming from Esther behind the door .
HAMMER: Wait ! I did n't want it to come to this , ut you leave me no choice . I have no other option but to use the most powerful weapon in the Jewish arsenal .
SANTA: What are you doing ?
HAMMER: I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this ? I come to fight you , and you do n't even put out anything to nosh on ? What kind of arch nemesis are you ?
SANTA: Hah ! Jewish guilt . Well , it wo n't work on me Hammer . I 'm too strong for it .
HAMMER: What sort of host would treat company this way ? Esther is clearly uncomfortable in your guest room . I 'm shvitizing from unning around shooting people . And my feet . What kind of flooring is this anyway ? My arches are killing me . It 's beginning to work on Santa .
SANTA: No . Stop it !
HAMMER: And to top it off , you did n't even have the courtesy to give me a proper hello when I entered the room . What have I eve done to you to be treated with such disrespect ? Santa 's a wreck .
SANTA: Please , make it stop . I 'll do anything . Here take my gun .
MOHAMMED: Hammer , you alright ?
HAMMER: Everything 's kosher . Watch him for me .
HAMMER: Esther !
ESTHER: Mordechai !
HAMMER: Joseph Lieberman ? The Hammer begins to untie Joe .
JOSEPH LIEBERMAN: Mordechai ! Thank god you 're here . Esther looks at the Hammer curiously .
ESTHER: You two know each other ?
HAMMER: We go to the same temple .
SANTA: Please tell me . What is the true meaning of Hanukkah ?
HAMMER: That'sthat 's a very good question . And I do know that it does have something to do withdreidels , and Esther chimes in .
ESTHER: and latkes .
HAMMER: And latkes ! And some miracle oil that lasted eight days . And that my friend , should 've been enough for you . Take him away Mo . Mo drags Santa out of the room .
SANTA: I 'm sorry . I see the light now . I was wrong . I 'm And Santa 's gone .
HAMMER: Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal , will you marry me ? She glows .
ESTHER: Yes ! Of course ! I 'd gladly give up my last name to be with you . The two kiss in celebration . Joe pokes his head out into the Hallway .
JOE LIEBERMAN: What happened out there ?
HAMMER: Well then maybe you should have thought about that before you ran with him . C'mon , let 's get you back to Washington .

HELLBOY: Gee whiz , Manning-
SHRUGS: I guess we 're out now .
GUARD 1: Check it out . That guy 's make-up is so fake . I mean , come on , solid red- Guard 2 is cleaning his gun .
GUARD 2: And what 's with his forehead ? Is that goggles ?
CHAMBERLAIN: Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please , follow me , Sire .
PRINCE: I will not .
CHAMBERLAIN: Then , I regret to say , you may not see your father . It is the protocol , sire . For peasant and prince alike . Please- fo the last time- surrender your sword . A tense beat and then the Prince relents .
PRINCE: Mr. Wink however- can not dispose of his weapon . He will wait here-
KING: Why have you done this ? ? His voice trembles with anger .
PRINCE: I have returned from exile to set us free . All of us , Father- And to reclaim what has been taken from our people . The land and the freedom that is rightfully ours .
KING: No- You have broken a truce that has lasted for centuries .
PRINCE: A shameful truce , worth nothing . How can you abide it ? How- ? They have no respect for themselves , their Gods or the earth-
BEAT: And they scorn us- every time they raise a dead , cold building , destroy a forest , or take more land- The PRINCESS then steps forward .
PRINCESS: What they do is in their nature . We must honor our side of the agreement-
PRINCE: Honor- ?
BEAT: Look at this place . Is this where you hold court ? ?
KING: And what would your solution be- ? War ? Why ?
PAUSE: It may just be that our days are ended
PRINCE: It may be- but we will not go quiet . We will not fade like this . Better to burn than fade away And for this
KING: No- you can not be that mad-
PRINCE: Yes . I am .
KING: This is the path you wish to take ? Knowing the cost ?
PRINCE: Yes , Father- it is .
KING: Then , I am sorry my son- you leave me no choice . Death .
GRIM: I agree . Death it is-
PRINCE: Hear me all ! ! ! There are some amongst you that have already seen the light- Seen the future

PRINCESS: Yrdrig ! !
HELLBOY: I think I did good . And I looked good , do n't you think , Liz ?
ABE: Look- there 's Manning
HELLBOY: A gas pocket ? ? ! ! Ha- ! I love it .
BEAT: Only Liz handled herself with any dignity .
LIZ: No one asked me anything .
MANNING: Do n't bother starting a fan club . It 's trending five to one against us .
HELLBOY: Against ?
LIZ: Polls- protests- hate mail- Liz grabs a few letters and scans them .
READING: `` Unwelcome species mongrelizing lower orders ungodly freaks '' She glares at Hellboy .
HELLBOY: Ungodly freaks- ? Us ?
MANNING: You really did it this time- I 'm unde eview . But so are you- As of today , there 's a new team leader .
HELLBOY: New - ? What ?
MANNING: Yes- You heard me . A new team leader . We 're to meet him at the conference room at 0900- Now .
HELLBOY: What 's the matter , Manning ? ? Do n't you trust me anymore ?
MANNING: Oh- I never did- But after last night , Washington wants a new public face fo the BPRD-
HELLBOY: What about me ? What 's wrong with my face ? ? ?
MANNING: Or mine ? ? ? The press loves me ! ! But now you 've ruined it all-
HELLBOY: But , who- ? Who is this guy ?
MANNING: How would I know ? Evidently , he 's quite the big shot- His name is Johann Kraus-
HELLBOY: Akkk- Kraus ? ? ? He 's German-
OVERLAPPING: -a physical medium , head of the European anch of the BPRD-
OVERLAPPING: You know I have a problem with Germans-
OVERLAPPING: -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult Practice from the University of Munich and a very eloquent speaker-
OVERLAPPING: -Germans make me nervous-
MANNING: I guess they need a nice open face- A face people can trust . Finally , next to steel cage , they meet-
JOHANN: Johann Kraus , at your service .
HELLBOY: That 's an open face for you
JOHANN: Poor things , bought and sold on the black market . Smuggled in tight , cramped cages . Let 's see what they can remember-
HELLBOY: Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die- -but maybe I can be of help- Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet .
JOHANN: Oh , no , no- No amulets are required .
HELLBOY: What are you doing ?
JOHANN: I can inhabit inanimate things organic ,
JOHANN: Exactly .
HELLBOY: Whaddayawant ? ? ? You chewed off the tip of my tail- Yes , you-
ABE: Touche . More high-pitched jabbering
BEAT: Troll language-
LIZ: The troll market- ?
JOHANN: Exactly , Miss Sherman .
HELLBOY: Jeez- your buddy there does n't look too good .
JOHANN: I 'm losing my grip on its limbic system- He feels nauseous . I 'm afraid he 's about to die-
HELLBOY: Wow- You have that effect on me too .
ABE: How can we find the Troll market ? ? ? Its location has been a source of speculation for centuries
JOHANN: Yes , well- Trolls dwell under bridges- And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist- places it under Washington Bridge
ABE: We 've looked there before Staked it out for weeks-
JOHANN: Yes , but this time I have asked for a very special piece of equipment- He moves in to a large crate marked `` Lot 336 ''
ABE: `` 336 '' The schufftein glasses ? ?
JOHANN: On loan from the Smithsonian . Plus we have this clue- He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL .
HELLBOY: If you 're really German- how come you do n't have a funny accent ?
SIGHS: Get ready . We are on the move .
HELLBOY: What a moron ! ! `` We are on the move '' He thinks he 's so hot ! ! We 've been looking for that place for years and we 've neve found it- You said so-
LIZ: Get used to it . He might be here for good-
HELLBOY: For good ? !
LIZ: He has a nice voice .
ABE: Yes , very commanding , very soothing .
HELLBOY: I think he 's a jerk .
ABE: I like him .
HELLBOY: Well , then you 're a jerk , too . `` The ains of the operation- '' give me a eak !
LIZ: I think you feel threatened
HELLBOY: Ha ! Me ? Threatened ? ? Glaring , at Liz
LIZ: Not just him- this whole thing you did . The TV- the reporters-
HELLBOY: I did that ?
LIZ: Yes , Red- absolutely . 'Cause you did it without thinking- You just wanted to be in the public 's eye- well- you 're there- ut so are we .
HELLBOY: Hey- We got some hate mail .
SHRUGS: We 'll deal with it . Together .
HELLBOY: Something else bothering you- ? Liz nods quietly .
LIZ: I will , but not now- I 'm sorry if- I-
BEAT: I do n't like being watched . I never have . I feel like a freak only if someone 's watching me .
MANNING: May I suggest that tonight you refrain from signing autographs .
HELLBOY: It 's the garbage truck . It makes the wrong statement . About who we are .
MANNING: You think that 's what this is about ? Transportation ? ? ?
REPORTER 2: C'mon- show us your powers-
ABE: Oh- No , no , no , it 's not a parlor trick .
REPORTER 1: What are you , a mermaid ? ?
ABE: Oh , goodness , no- I-
REPORTER 2: You say you can read things- things about people- so read me- c'mon- read me-
ABE: Very well , if you insist . You keep a large , battery-operated vibrating egg by your bedside
REPORTER: You ! Demon-man ! Will you take a DNA test ?
HELLBOY: It 's `` Hellboy '' not `` Demon-man '' -
JOHANN: Let me take care of this .
HELLBOY: Great P.R
LIZ: Shh ! Give him a chance
JOHANN: -it 's been a long long time fo many decades really , that the BPRD has served you- all of you in silence . We have waged an unknown war - but a very eal one . Heroes have died unrewarded and unrecognized so that you might go about your daily life . To work , to marry , to id your children goodnight . Little by little , the crowd grows quiet .
JOHANN: I pray that you will allow us to defend your good fortune- to guarantee the lessing that is a peaceful night 's sleep . A night free from monsters and nightmares . And if so- If so- then all we ask in return from you is a little respect and the chance , remote as it may be , to prove ourselves worthy of a tiny , tiny place in this- God 's Earth .
HELLBOY: This is sooo corny- A moment of silence ensues
DAZZLED: He has a nice voice .
JOHANN: Come on . We have work to do-
HELLBOY: Nothing yet , Sparky , over-
LIZ: I read you , Red . Keep looking- Manning is bored , looks at his watch .
MANNING: Looking at what , for goodness sake- ? What do these things do- ?
ABE: In 1778 Emil Schufften , a Good friend of Benjamin Franklin , designed these optical sets with the intent of photographing fairies in England
MANNING: Let 's get out of here- We 're never going to find it-
HELLBOY'S VOICE: Hey- Sparky , I think we got one .
MANNING: That ? Oh , please , she looks as sweet as she can-
LIZ: Red , turn on the `` antiglamour '' filter Fairy folk use a spell called `` glamour '' to seem human and nice-
BEAT: These lenses allow you to see their real appearance
MANNING: Oh , dear Lord .
PAUSE: What about the cats ?
LIZ: She eats them .
MANNING: `` She ? ? '' That 's a `` she '' ? ? ? ? ?
HELLBOY: We 're moving in , Sparky-
WHISPERS: Maybe we can bowl a few frames , uh ?
ABE: Bowling balls- they give me trouble .
HELLBOY: How about a beer , then ? Now that we 're `` out '' - Whaddya say , Mein Herr ?
JOHANN: Sorry . I do n't drink .
JOHANN': Adjust the prisms to `` 2 ''
HELLBOY: What the heck is that ?

JOHANN: What about this ? ? Do you recognize this seal ?
SHOP OWNER: You 'd better go . Now .
JOHANN: Please . We 'll make it worth your while .
HELLBOY: Well , neither am I-
SHOP OWNER: It 's rumors ! just- No- do n't hit me , all right ? There 's talk of a revolt- a evolt against the human world- Hellboy releases him , then looks around .
HELLBOY: Where the hell is Abe ? ? He pushes his belt locator-
ABE: I 'm following a lead , Red . Keep you locator - . A large TROLL cuts him off-
PRINCESS: If you are looking for your weapons , my guards took them .
ABE: I - I carry no weapons , madam- I assure you
PRINCESS: Why were you following me ?
ABE: Your brother- ? ?
PRINCESS: In his revolt against the humans ?
ABE: A revolt ? No , no , no , I- You are sorely mistaken
PRINCESS: Then answer me truthfully- Why were you following me ?
ABE: My name is Abe Sapien -
LAUGHING: There is no such name !
ABE: Horrible- I know- but- Please , hear me , I eg you . I am an agent of the Bureau fo Paranormal Research and Defense . If we can assist you-
PRINCESS: Give me your hand .
WHEEZING: Nice puppy
PRINCESS: My father gave him to me . Yrdrig , leave our guest alone- The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor .
ABE: Your highness , the honor is all mine .
PRINCESS: May I apologize , Mr. Sapien , for the manner in which we brought you here could n't be too sure . She offers him the locator belt .
ABE: Please , it was nothing . Love the puppy ,
PRINCESS: And under diplomatic immunity - may I seek asylum ? ?
ABE: We would be honored , I 'm sure . But , may I ask from whom do you seek asylum ?
PRINCESS: And that was my royal guard .
ABE: Red , apologize at once ! We are in the presence of royalty !
JOHANN: You 're vouching for her , I take it . M Sapien ?
ABE: Oh , most definitely . She 's from an ancient , noble line -
JOHANN: - of warriors . The Children of the Earth . I 'm sorry , Princess Nuala . With such a fierce bloodline , we can not take you claim of allegiance at face value . He produces the ANCIENT SEAL .
PRINCESS: Where did you get this ?
HELLBOY: Human side , two nights ago- The Princess studies their faces .
PRINCESS: In ancient times a seal like this was delivered to the enemy as a declaration of war . A signal from the underground ealm to the entire world . It prefaced the awakening of the Golden Army- Johann sits down heavily .
JOHANN: I feared as much .
HELLBOY: What- ? What- ? A goblin army- ?
JOHANN: Golden Army . The unstoppable tide . There has been nothing to substantiate such a
PRINCESS: Not a tale- At the dawn of time Even efore the great flood , man and the Children of the Earth shared this planet But as man in his greed expanded his dominion , there ensued a bitter war
KING: I am King Balor , leader of the Golden Army . Is there anyone here who disputes my right ? ? ?
HELLBOY: Where is that crown ? ?
PRINCESS: My father had it destroyed . Cut into three pieces . One for mankind
ABE: So , you do need our help.. ?
PRINCESS: I 'm afraid it 's the other way around . She holds the CYLINDER she purchased .
ABE: Just a global chart , Edo - that 's the old name for Tokyo - Moscow , and Renvyle here-
PRINCESS: But nothing else- She rolls back the map into the cylinder .
HELLBOY: Good , I like trouble .

JOHANN: Oh , I see- you want to punch me- That 's how you win an argument .
HELLBOY: I try .
JOHANN: Well , you 're big , I 'll give you that much-

JOHANN: Very- slow- I 've seen your fighting style . Very slow-
HELLBOY: Slow enough for ya- ? ?
JOHANN: See ? Speed is the key .
HELLBOY: Chicken shit !
PRINCESS: `` I sometimes have a queer feeling - especially when you are near me , as now it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs , tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame . ''

ABE: Renvyle , Ireland- The ancient isles-
NODS: A magical place in the West . A different time . Long gone . Now , he 's near and he 's looking for me . I can feel and even understand his . hatred for mankind .
ABE: Men usually mean well , I believe that . But they need our help and patience .
PRINCESS: You were very brave , vouching for me . How do you know I 'm not the enemy , bringing me here ?
ABE: It 's as you were saying , I suppose . From intuition , feeling . I 've never met anyone like you but that 's my instinct .
HELLBOY: He caught me off-guard- but I 'll get him next time .
LIZ: There should n't be a `` next time '' we 're all part of the same team .

GESTURING: Come here , I 'll show you Liz backs away , shaking her head .
LIZ: No ! I do n't want to see it ! We 've got to do something !
ABE: I can not reverse the magic- we have to look for the Prince or somebody that can help Red .
LIZ: Go after that son-of-a-bitch and get him to reverse the spell ! !
JOHANN: He 'll demand the gold piece-
LIZ: So ? We find it ! We give it to him- ! !
AGENT AGATE: A lupgarou loose in Picadilly , a Winged creature nesting in a skyscraper- We have a situation in almost every point of the map .
JOHANN: The Rebellion 's spreading too fast- The only way to stop it is to stop the Prince .
LIZ: Any luck ?
ABE: No . Sorry .
LIZ: It does n't matter .
ABE: No - ?
LIZ: No . Forget the gold piece . Let 's us just find this royal asshole .
FIERCE: Fire and water , me and you , Abe . We 'll kick his ass . Abe looks supremely troubled .
LIZ: Abe , let 's do this for Red !
ABE: The map contained within the cylinde seems useless-
BEAT: Now the case itself proves very useful-
ABE: Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and he other were born there . They hold it sacred .
MANNING: Even if you 're right , we sit tight and locate the gold piece , make sure he neve ever gets his hands on it . If there 's any truth to this legend , the fate of the world depends on it .
LIZ: What about Red ? ? Do n't you care about him ? ? ?
JOHANN: Liz . That may be his destiny . Manning is ight we ca n't take the chance . Liz glares at him .
LIZ: I see . Red was right about you . Welcome to the team , Johann . And goodbye . She leaves the room .
HELLBOY: Do n't worry , Sparky- It 's all going to be
ABE: We 'll make it alright . Screw Manning- You are right , Liz- We should just do this together the three of us . Liz smiles .
LIZ: We stay here much longer , we 're gon na get caught
ABE: Just a few more minutes . Here 's an easy way to remember that `` port '' means `` left . '' They each have four- A NOISE from the door it 's Johann .
JOHANN: Good evening , friends .
LIZ: Do n't try to stop us , Johann .
JOHANN: On the contrary . I 've been giving it some thought , and we should be able to save Hellboy . After all , the Prince lacks the gold crown . Without it , his army poses no threat . None at all . Abe is very quiet .
ABE: Its useless- I- I- can't- I ca n't pilot this thing
JOHANN: I 'll give it a try-
AGENT: Sir - you 'd better come , fast -
MANNING: Got it - ow !
AGENT: Is n't that Johann at the controls ?
PRINCE: Maybe this will help you remember who we are , who you are What our destiny is-
HELLBOY: Where are we , Liz.. ?
LIZ: Near the ocean , Red.We'regonna make you well here .
ABE: This should be the portal . By all rights-
JOHANN: Abe , bring the mapcase over here .
LIZ: Yes ! Try it , Abe-
JOHANN: Before you do anything remember what we 're in for . A world unlike anything we 've ever known . Dangerous , deceptive
LIZ: You 're wasting time ! Abe inserts and twists the cylinder .
JOHANN: Dangerous , deceptive and hard to leave . They walk under the tree roots , into
ABE: Renvyle is over there .
GOBLIN: I bid you welcome , strangers . Would you e seeking safe passage to Renvyle ?
LIZ: Yes ! Can you help us ?
QUIET: Careful , Liz .
SATYR: I 'm sure you can come to an understanding !
GOBLIN: Room enough for all of you ! Even your weary friend .
JOHANN: What will it cost , boatman ?
GOBLIN: Ah , next to nothing ! Make me an offer . Abe , Johann and Liz confer among themselves
LIZ: How much ?
CROW: He wo n't want money .
JOHANN: I have a belt !
GOBLIN: I have no use for such a thing . Liz shows him her binoculars .
LIZ: Here is a wonderful set of eyes , magic eyes that will bring the world-
GOBLIN: I already have binoculars ! No , I see something special . He points toward Hellboy 's chest .
SATYR: Under his bandage - !
GOBLIN: That ! That - in exchange for your crossing !
LIZ: Do n't you touch it - !
GOBLIN: Is it so precious to you ? Let me pull it out .
ABE: You must n't . One touch can kill him .
GOBLIN: Ah . I see . We must go to the Angel of
CROW: He 'll know what to do .
LIZ: Oh , my God . She knows - ? !
JOHANN: Our ferry captain - he wants his payment
LIZ: I almost lost you- Hellboy smiles and grabs her hand-
HELLBOY: I thought you were mad at me .
LIZ: Well , no one can stay mad forever .
HELLBOY: I 'm sorry for all the attention , I thought it would be good for us .
LIZ: We 're never going to make them all happy , Red . What we have is ours and no one
BELLBOY: I can turn my back on the world . I do n't care anymore I don't- as long as you stay with me- as long as you think I 'm still a good man .
BEAT: Am I a good man , Liz ? ? Am I ? ?
LIZ: Yes you are . You are the best man I 've ever met .
HELLBOY: You still seem sad . Is there anything you want to tell me- ? ?
LIZ: Yes , there is-
HELLBOY: Say it now , then . Whatever it is , I 'm eady .
SIGHS: Is it about Johann-
LIZ: No- no- what are you talking about ? ?
JOHANN: Abe and I have found the entrance to the Golden Army 's resting place- Liz come with us- You should stay behind and get some rest-
HELLBOY: And call you in the morning , right ? ? Like Hell I will . I 'm keeping an eye on you ,
JOHANN: There . Abe points at the violent sea below-
ABE: The only way in- I 'm afraid we 'll have to jump in- Can you make it- ? Hellboy nods .
BELLBOY: Strange . If this is the entrance-
ABE: I know- Why is n't there more security ? ?
HELLBOY: See ? ? It hurts ! ! ! It hurts ! ! !
ABE: Red , are you- ?
HELLBOY: Do n't say a word , Blue- Let 's move on-
JOHANN: Hang on , people . I 'll be right back .
LIZ: Hold up . We need to rest .
HELLBOY: Says who ? I 'm fine , I tell ya .
LIZ: This was a mistake . He 's -
JOHANN: Mein Gott The stairs lead to-
HELLBOY: Hey , amigo . You got some gum ?
JOHANN: Most ingenious . A versatile , highly mobile killing machine .
LIZ: Make that machines , Johann . I see more than one .
HELLBOY: Wow . You hear that ? Listen -
PRINCE: As a boy , they say I enjoyed toy soldiers . So do you , I see .
HELLBOY: Yeah . Now it 's your turn .
PRINCE: Do you envy these contraptions ? They never bleed . They feel nothing . Not even the zest of combat .
PRINCE: You have the remaining piece , I presume .
JOHANN: We do not -
SURPRISED: Then you are most foolish .
JOHANN: The death you would unleash will neve happen ! What you need is far from here and will stay out of your reach forever .
ABE: Stop - I have it .
APPROACHING: Here For her Take it
JOHANN: Oh , my God . What has he done ?
HELLBOY: Abe -
ABE: You can not fight him- not without hurting her
BEAT: What would you do if it was Liz ? ?
PRINCE: I am Prince Nuada and I command my army to life once more . Does anyone dispute my ight ?
ABE: That was your price ! ! A ransom , you said - paid in good faith ! !
HELLBOY: Abe old buddy . If we survive this , we need to talk .
ABE: He - he 's a cad ! Can you imagine , a highborn heir to the throne , last in a noble line of-
BELLBOY: Not now , Abe , okay ?
LIZ: Let me -
JOHANN: Invincibility ! ? So - the only one thing may stop them -
HELLBOY: Prince Nuada I challenge your right to command this army !
ABE: No= please- no- Hellboy moves away from him .
HELLBOY: A challenge must be answered ! Raise you sword !
PRINCE: A challenge from you ? A nobody ? ? You are no one .
PRINCESS: No ! ! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the Fallen one- He has the right !
PRINCE: Very well . May his fate show you the cost of pride and blindness .
JOHANN: Hellboy 's too weak-
LIZ: No ! ! NO ! !
HELLBOY: I- have- won-
PRINCE: No . You have not-
PRINCESS: We 'll find each other again , somewhere . And she dies in his arms . In the center of the arena
PRINCE: You think you 're any different from me ? The humans - they will tire of you . They will disappoint you . And in the end , they will betray you . You are living a lie . Your time will come again . May you make a better choice .
HELLBOY: You - and your kind ! Leave here . And stay in the shadows - where you belong .
JOHANN: Any last minute requests ?
ABE: Do it , please . I - I 'm ready for the real world now .
STARTLED: Whoa ! Where 'd you come from ? We were just-
BELLBOY: I know , here to help . Well , I appreciate that Manning .
ABE: Yes , Mr. Manning . I want to thank you , too . For all you 've done for us over the years . He gives his stuff to the astonished agent .
MANNING: What ? What , exactly is this ?
ABE: I quit .
MANNING: Come on . You 're resigning ?
HELLBOY: Looks that way , does n't it ?
MANNING: Liz not you , too ! ? They ca n't do this . Stop them , Johann-
JOHANN: Manning , you 're an asshole .
LIZ: What you said before - about us living
HELLBOY: I mean it ! ` Course , I 'm thinking USA ut , hey - you decide .

KIRSTY: No !
STEVE: What 's wrong ?
KIRSTY: Do n't let them take me , Steve -

JOEY: And what is this frozen moment ?
ELLIOTT: The cusp of my life . What I was , what I am , what I will be past , present , future , all bound here at this timeless moment of decision . I was an explore of forbidden vices and pleasures . Opening the Box was my final act of exploration , of discovery .
JOEY: And what did you discover ?
ELLIOTT: Something bad .
JOEY: And why are you back ? Why are we here ?
ELLIOTT: Because something worse is coming .

JOEY: What will he do ? What does he want ?
ELLIOTT: He 'll do what he does best . But he 'll do it unfettered . He wants to walk the Earth forever , indulging his taste fo all the myriad subtleties of human suffering .
JOEY: What can we do ?
ELLIOTT: I like you , Joey . You ask all the right questions . There is something we can do ut it will require great courage .
JOEY: I do n't know
ELLIOTT: Joey , you walked through your window from one reality to another . You 're stronger than you think .
JOEY: Then tell me what to do .
ELLIOTT: This is his first night on Earth . He wants to close the door behind him . Like all Lieutenants , he covets command . There 's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back . He has to destroy it .

JOEY: Wha . ?
ELLIOTT: The Box , Joey . He wants the Box .

ETTY: Hey , Amy
AMY: Morning
BETTY: Morning ? It 's half past four .
AMY: Mmm
BETTY: Mr. Rickman Amy 's here . Right .
CHARLES: Ah , I detect that unique and ubiquitous combination of female sweat and patchouli oil that signals the arrival of He turns toward a dour Amy .
AMY: Eat me , Charles .
CHARLES: It 's exactly that lack of respect fo authority that got you fired from the New York Post .
AMY: I was n't fired . I was re-assigned .
CHARLES: Of course . Where would you be without me ? By the way , I do n't recall ever being thanked properly for this `` re- assignment '' . Charles makes air quotes with his fingers .
AMY: I seem to recall a rather simila `` reassignment '' with you , Charles .
CHARLES: Touche ' . Well , thanks to international conglomerates and the Euro-dollar I , along with Mother England , am blessed with your acquaintance , yet again .
AMY: Hey a contract 's a contract . She holds up the cassette recorder .
CHARLES: It 's not about the crack whores , I 'm sure you 're working your usual unrestrained insightful magic on what I 'm certain will e another eye-opening expose . I expect nothing but brilliance in five thousand words or less . But this is better .
AMY: So what then ? Are we being sued again ?
CHARLES: Hmm ? Oh no . Please feel free to have some of that .
AMY: Thanks . What is this ? General Tso 's cat ?
CHARLES: Spare me the `` Nothing comes close to New York Chinese '' speech just this once . Go on , sit down . Just something I wanted to show you
AMY: What is it ? Charles closes the door .
CHARLES: Something . Amy , with your encyclopedic world-wide knowledge of skank-ology have you ever heard of `` Deaders ? ''
AMY: Oh , sure . They 're generally in thei forties , kind of ex-hippy types . They still think Jerry Garcia is like `` really cool '' even though he 's dead .
CHARLES: Not dead-heads Dead - ers . D-E-A-D-E-R S .
AMY: You know , sometimes they wear ponytails . Dream about how great the sixties were . You see ` em in the park sometimes
CHARLES: Love of my life , go screw yourself . I 'm asking you a serious question .
AMY: No , Charles . I 've never heard of `` Deaders . ''
CHARLES: Watch the tape .
MARLA: Okay , okay . Here we go . There 's Anna
VOICES: Shh . Quiet . We 're starting .
KATYA: Yes .
ATYA: My skin is n't real . My eyes are n't real . My muscles are n't real . My bones , my heart , my veins and nerves , and flesh and meat are n't real . What I see , what I hear , what I taste , what I touch , what I emember , what I think , what I feel , are n't real .
KATYA: I 'm not real .
CHARLES: Just keep watching .
KATYA: I 'm not real . I 'm not
CHARLES: Just watch
AMY: I want to know if you 've called the pol
CHARLES: I said , `` Just watch . ''
AMY: Oh , man , do n't tell me that was some special effect
CHARLES: You tell me .
AMY: This is sick
CHARLES: That 's saying a lot , for you .
KATYA: it ) I 'm fine
ATYA: I feel great She starts laughing .
KATYA: Oh , man ! Oh , man
AMY: What the hell
CHARLES: That 's what I said .
AMY: Have you have you found any of these
CHARLES: I have n't done anything . I told you , I just looked at it today . By some chance are you interested in pursuing this ?
AMY: How could she
CHARLES: Who said miracles can only happen at Lourdes ?
AMY: Who said they happen there ?
HARLES: Amy you know what my father said once
AMY: That all writers were queers ?
CHARLES: No , that was a different time . This time , we were driving down the block and there was this fortune-telling place , you know , this gypsy fortune telling place in a store front ? And he said , `` You know , if I could tell the future I would n't be living in any crappy store front . '' He looks back at the tape .
AMY: Maybe they 're just getting started .
CHARLES: Maybe .
AMY: What else do we have besides the tape ?
CHARLES: Just a return address on the envelope .
AMY: Why Charles
CHARLES: I still like to keep my finger on the pulse , even though I know you think I do n't have one .
AMY: You know me too well .
CHARLES: It 's what keeps me up at night . Now here 's the part where I 'm supposed to say be careful . Be careful .
AMY: Always .
CHARLES: Call me when you get settled . She just smirks and exits .
AMY: Yes , I ah..
MANAGER: You 're not Chinese .
AMY: She 's my half sister . Same Mom . Different Dads . I have n't heard from her in two weeks so I got nervous .
MANAGER: Like what ?
AMY: Look . Marla is a friend of mine and she 's missing .
MANAGER: Five minutes .
AMY: She 's dead
MANAGER: Dead
AMY: Dead ! She hung herself in the bathroom . Call the police .
MANAGER: Already did . Who are you ? What do you have in there ?
MARLA: I knew you 'd come . Course if you 're watching this tape , it 's already too late for me . But maybe you can stop it .
AMY: Yeah
CHARLES: Do n't tell me I woke you up . I wo n't elieve that .
AMY: You know I do n't sleep when I 'm working . What do you want , Charles ?
CHARLES: You were supposed to call me .
AMY: You know me , I dove right in . I was gon na ' call you tomorrow .
CHARLES: The thing is I started thinking .
AMY: You know that 's never a good thing Charles .
CHARLES: Look . I know the crazy stuff you do for a story .
AMY: That 's what I get paid for .
CHARLES: And that 's why I hired you . It 's just . Just the thing is , Amy some things you should n't do , you know what I mean ?
AMY: Like what ?
CHARLES: Look , I say this to you , but in my heart I know that one time it 's going to happen that you 're going to end up , I do n't know dead or god knows what . But when it does happen , I do n't want it to e my fault .
AMY: Okay , Charles . I 'll make sure it wo n't e .
CHARLES: You know , you 're messing with my conscience , here . Amy
AMY: Charles , I ca n't do the sensitive thing . I do n't know how . I get the message . I knew the message before I got it . Okay , Mommy ? You 've had a change of heart ? You want me to come home ? Well I ca n't . Not until I know the truth . So there . You 're off the hook . I got ta go .
MARLA: Do n't open
ONDUCTOR: Next car .
AMY: Is Joey on this ride ?
CONDUCTOR: Come on in
JOEY: Ahhhh , now here comes a daring soul . A person committed to a just cause . Anothe seeker of the truth no doubt . Joey is clearly smitten with Amy .
AMY: Are you Joey ?
JOEY: I 've been called worse .
AMY: Amy Klein . Marla Chen sent me . I 'm looking for a girl named Katya . Anothe young girl with red hair and half he head shaved . A guy with glasses named Winter .
JOEY: And the plot thickens . Do n't tell me you 're mixed up with those mothe fuckers . Tell me Amy Klein , do you even know what they 're about ?
AMY: That 's why I 'm here . I need you to help me find them .
JOEY: Oh , jeez . Moral quandary time here What should he do , what should he do ? If he tells her the hopefully available and eminently fuckable damsel is thrown into the pit of oblivion or anyway is potentially fucked up for life . And that would be such a regrettable waste . If he efrains from telling her she may yet e saved . A possible trophy awaits me . Angel and devil on the shoulder hmm . Angel , devil , angel , devil . Oh , the hell with it Entropy 's destroying everything anyway . Why should n't I do my part ?
JOEY: You first . What do you think they do ?
AMY: I think they bring the dead back to life .
JOEY: Is that what you really think ?
AMY: Who are they ? Where can I find Winter ?
JOEY: Some people say Winter 's some sort of fucked-up guru , some say he 's not human , and others say he 's not real . But there is a place they hang out those who elieve I mean .
AMY: Where is it ?
JOEY: Angel , devil , angel , devil .
AMY: If you do n't tell me , someone here will .
JOEY: Yeah , you see , now that 's the problem . You 've got that fucked up self- destructive thing going on .
AMY: I 'm already into it .
JOEY: Angel , devil , angel , devil
CONDUCTOR: Coming in !
JOEY: I ca n't take responsibility for you .
AMY: I 'm not asking you to .
JOEY: Amy Klein , I 'm doing a change of heart thing here , which does n't usually happen with strangers , but I 'm trying to give a little back , it 's this whole Karma kick I 'm on do n't do it . Do n't go any deeper . Forget about it . Move away . Change your name . Become somebody different .
AMY: Ca n't do that . I 've got that fucked up self- destructive thing going on .
JOEY: Yes you do .
VOICE: Amy Klein !
AMY: Hey ! You hit someone ! Someone fell in front of the train ! Hey ! Hey !
DRIVER: Where ? Where is he ? Where 'd he fall ?
AMY: Back there , way back
DRIVER: Aw , damn Dammit !
COP: Well , the men have looked .
AMY: And there 's nothing there ?
COP: You do n't seem terribly surprised .
AMY: Hmm ?
COP: I mean , you do n't seem terribly surprised that there is n't somebody under the train . A
MY: I do n't know what to say . I saw him
COP: Yeah . That 's the thing . Can you tell me again , just what it is that you saw ?
AMY: Um , I was standing on the platform
COP: Did he say anyth
AMY: It 's him . !
COP: Hey
AMY: It 's them ! Over there , over there !
CHARLES: Christ , you 're lucky to have a boss like me . Once again , I have saved your small ut relatively shapely behind .
AMY: Least you got to travel . What were they going to charge me with , anyway ?
CHARLES: Charge you ? They were thinking of shipping you to the government asylum fo observation and believe me if you go in there , you do n't come out . But through my mastery of international negotiations I managed to convince them that you were merely irresponsible . You got your stuff ?
AMY: Yeah .
CHARLES: Come on .
AMY: Why 'd you give me this story ?
CHARLES: Who else would have taken it ? Eithe they 're going to think it 's bull-shit , o they 're going to be too afraid of it . But Amy Klein Tell me it 's real Amy .
AMY: It 's real or I 'm crazy .
CHARLES: Well , either way , it 's a good story .
AMY: I 've got leads . I 'll know in the end .
CHARLES: You know , Amy dearest , for the average person , hunger for knowledge is like hunger for food . We want to know just enough to take the edge off our appetite . Then we 're satisfied , and we stop . But you you 're like a glutton . You ca n't help over-eating .
AMY: I do n't see you complaining .
CHARLES: But you see , that 's the point . That 's why I need you . Because all that stuff I do n't eat I still want . So I send you in to do the eating for me , and so I get to experience it , without actually suffering any mental indigestion .
AMY: That 's for me
CHARLES: Nobody 's forcing anything down you throat . Correct ?
AMY: No .
CHARLES: You see , Amy , you never grew up with all this Catholic god and guilt stuff . It does n't mean anything to you . I worry about god and heaven and hell . Not during the day , you understand , but around three in the morning , it keeps me up . I want to know what 's coming . What 's up in heaven and down in hell , or even if there 's nothing . It 's useful , when you 're making plans . So go find out and we 'll tell the world .
AMY: You know , Charles , there 's something vaguely demonic about you .
CHARLES: Did you know , the word `` demon '' comes from the Greek word for `` knowledge . '' As in `` demonstrate . ''
AMY: No , I did n't know that . Charles shakes his head , disgusted .
CHARLES: American education .
MY: You do n't have to worry .
CHARLES: I never do . I 'm not here to save people and I 'm not here to judge them . I just take ` em as they come . And use them as they pass by . I 'll be at the Soffitel .
AMY: Christ
BLACK KID: Shhhh follow me .
AMY: You know me .
AMY: That does n't mean anything . What I saw in that room was real . What I smelled was eal . Real like this table .
DEADERS: My skin is n't real . My eyes are n't real . My muscles are n't real . My bones , my heart , my veins and nerves , and flesh and meat are n't real-
AMY: You 're crazy .
DEADERS: - What I see , what I hear , what I taste , what I touch , what I remember , what I think , what I feel , are n't real .
AMY: It 's not real it 's not real
CHARLES: Amy it 's Charles , I know it 's not too late .
AMY: You just ca n't go too long without hearing my voice .
CHARLES: Guilty . Look , Amy , I 've been thinking about the story about what happened , maybe this is n't for you .
AMY: Charles , you know I value your opinion-
CHARLES: - she said with condescension-
AMY: - but if there was ever a story I was orn to write , this is it .
CHARLES: I think it 's too dangerous , for a lot of easons .
AMY: This is n't like you .
CHARLES: I know . I 'm going to hate myself in the morning .
AMY: I 'm just a little fucked in the head . That 's all . It 's just a funk , but I 'm fine . All I need is some sleep .
CHARLES: OK . I just thought I 'd put it out there to see if you 'd bite . I should 've known etter . It goes against my instincts .
CHARLES: Yes I believe I 've heard that somewhere efore .
AMY: Well , I wish somebody had told me about it .
AMY: Hello , hello ? Hello ? Is there anyb
MARLA: Only he can bring you back .
PINHEAD: `` to all of us - there comes the closing of the doors - the entrances - the exits - so that one may pass no more out o in '' He closes the book , turns toward her .
AMY: Came with the room . Along with the uncomfortable couch . Amy puts the phone back on the table .
PINHEAD: I did n't . Believe me , when I want to hurt you , it will be more than a scratch .
AMY: Then why the hell are you here ? Why are you in my room ?
PINHEAD: This is n't your room . It 's mine
AMY: What
PINHEAD: This is my room , my building , my street my world . You still ca n't elieve that you 're in the `` real '' world , can you ? I mean you 've just had a A knife run through you . Should n't it hurt ?
AMY: It 's a dream . I 'm dreaming
PINHEAD: No . Dreams come to an end . Nightmares are forever . He approaches her . She backs away .
AMY: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
PINHEAD: You will . Soon enough . But one should n't worship false Gods . Especially when that false God is themselves .
AMY: I 'm not a believer .
PINHEAD: Oh you will . Tell me , do you believe in Hell ?
AMY: Starting to .
PINHEAD: You opened a door . He pulled you in . But the only way out is through me . He steps towards her .
JOEY: Well look who 's back . What now ?
AMY: I need please please help me .
JOEY: Help you with what ?
AMY: I do n't understand . Why are n't I dead ? O am I ? Please
JOEY: Life , death , they 're not all that different , really . You can find you death in your life . You can find you life in your death . Round and round and ound you go .
AMY: Please , help me .
JOEY: I am helping you .
AMY: Then explain what the hell is going on . Why did I have a knife buried in my back ? Why am I seeing dead people walking around ? Why is there a guy with Pins in his head stopping by in the middle of the night for a chat . She gets in his face .
JOEY: Whoa . It 's time to give in Amy , you 're just fighting it too hard . Forget about the truth , forget about reality , just sit ack and enjoy the ride . There 's nothing you can do anyway . We 're all just piece 's in Winter 's little puzzle .
AMY: The box .
JOEY: You 're willing to do anything to find the truth .
AMY: Joey ? He does n't answer . He does n't move .
MARLA: We have to go
AMY: Why ?
MARLA: I did n't have any other choice .
AMY: What 's happening to me ?
MARLA: You 're dying . Like me .
AMY: Where ?
MARLA: That 's for you to decide .
AMY: Then why are you here ?
MARLA: To try Because I have no other choice . No turning back now- Know what I mean ?
AMY: No , I do n't . I do n't know one God damn thing anymore . I just want to go home . Marla gives her a comforting smile .
MARLA: Then let 's go home .
AMY: Marla what what happened to you ?
MARLA: I put my head through a noose and I jumped ten feet down . They cut me down , and Winter breathed into me , and I was alive . And everybody was happy and like , congratulating me Marla 's eyes are wet with yellowish tears .
AMY: Why are you doing this ? Why am I here ?
MARLA: For the reward from it all .
AMY: But why ? What it is all for ?
MARLA: That 's the missing link . That part he keeps to himself . But he promises an eternal paradise filled with the ultimate pleasures . We just ca n't be afraid . And we ca n't have any doubts . Guess I screwed up on that part .
CHARLES: Good morning .
AMY: What the hell happened ?
CHARLES: I did n't hear from you . I went over to your hotel . You were lying on the floor covered in every kind of stuff that can come out of a human body She remembers .
AMY: The blood
CHARLES: Okay . Every other kind .
AMY: I do n't I mean I did n't
CHARLES: You were sort of having a psychotic episode , sweets . Major mental blow-out . And frankly , it 's about time . Jesus you were tied down for a day and half . Listen , I 'm trying to get you out of here , back to London , but with the damage to your hotel room They 're not going to be so quick to let you go .
AMY: Hey , Charles , Charles this is the best news I 've had in a long time .
CHARLES: Well , there you go . A whole new definition of optimism .
AMY: What about Marla Chen ? The story ?
CHARLES: They found her dead in her room . She hung herself .
AMY: They found her . You mean the police ?
CHARLES: Yeah . She 'd been there awhile . Probably did it right after she sent us the tape .
AMY: Where is she ?
CHARLES: Jesus , I do n't know . Does it matter ?
AMY: No , I guess not .
CHARLES: But this is a good story too . Call it , `` My Psychotic Episode '' or , wait , maybe `` Psychotic - Episode One . '' Or `` Psychotic Pilot Episode . '' You know , some play on words with episode . Look , there 's a lot of raw material around here . Emphasis on the word `` raw . '' Maybe they 'll let you use a felt-tip pen or something to take notes .
KIRCHER: Well look who 's back . How we feelin ? She motions to the straps .
AMY: Trapped .
KIRCHER: Sorry . They 're for your own protection . The way you were flailing around when they brought you in somebody was bound to get hurt . Get it . BOUND to get hurt .
AMY: Do n't quit your day job .
CHARLES: What 's say we lose the charm bracelets for now ? Unless of course you somehow find all of this stimulating .
AMY: Do n't drag me into your fantasies Charles . Please .
CHARLES: I 'll see about getting a camera in here He stands , winks at her .
AMY: Mind if I join you ?
LITTLE GIRL: Please . I 'm drawing pictures .
AMY: I can see that , they 're lovely .
LITTLE GIRL: Want me to draw your picture ?
AMY: I 'd like that very much .
LITTLE GIRL: No peaking .
AMY: I 'm sorry , you 're right .
LITTLE GIRL: What do you think ?
AMY: How do you know my name ?
AMY: No this is n't happening .
MARLA: You say that like it 's a good thing .
AMY: Who ?
MARLA: Winter . This is where he sends all the trouble makers . Tries to show us who 's oss . Tries to make us believe .
AMY: So it is real ?
MARLA: As real as you want it to be . We all have our own version of the truth , some are just more screwed up than others . But you would n't know that , because you still do n't know the truth .
AMY: I do n't understand .
MARLA: You will . You see that 's the point . All this , `` Deaders '' , `` Cenobites '' , whateve you want to call it , it 's all about solving the puzzle . Part of that puzzle is you . Finding the secrets that are hidden within you .
MARLA: Ultimate pleasure more than anyone , even those who have solved the puzzle efore us , have ever known . Conditions of the nerve endings the likes of which you imagination could not hope to evoke .
AMY: Me .
MARLA: Bingo baby . Sorry .
AMY: Leave her alone !
DEADERS: My skin is n't real . My eyes are n't real . My muscles are n't real . My bones , my heart , my veins and nerves , and flesh and meat are n't real . What I see , what I hear , what I taste , what I touch , what I emember , what I think , what I feel , is n't real .
AMY: I ca n't .
JOEY: Where are the naked chicks ? The oil ? The orgies ? It 's not what Winter expected either .
AMY: I ca n't .
PINHEAD: I see that evil does run in the family . inter is plays it tough . But it 's all an act .
AMY: I did n't want any of this . They used me to open the box . I did n't choose to do anything .
PINHEAD: She 's one of us now Amy . Now a guide to the far reaches of pleasure . To a world where suffering is taken to higher level .
AMY: Please .
PINHEAD: You opened the box .
AMY: I did n't mean to . I only wanted the truth .
PINHEAD: And now you have it . But knowledge comes with a price and it 's time to pay .
AMY: What about them ?
PINHEAD: They belong to me now . They offered themselves willingly through him to me And now it 's time for you to do the same .
ARLA: You 're here to stop this Amy . He needs your soul willingly . Do n't let him take you . Do n't go willingly .
MARLA: Its over . Winter is gone . You ca n't come ack . You wo n't become a Deaderor one of them .
AMY: I did n't give my soul to him
PINHEAD: No !
BETTY: I just talked to the Police . Still , nothing . She 's just gone . Left her hotel , left her clothes , left her money . No sign of her anywhere .
CHARLES: See no Amy . Hear no Amy
BETTY: Just like Marla Chen . Apartment just left empty . No trace . The police say its to early to file an official report . Do you think they she with foul play ?
CHARLES: I do n't know , I just do n't know . Too bad , too . It would have made a hell of a story . I 'm sure she 'll come walking in here any minute , carrying with her my story .
BETTY: Maybe you have . Your three o'clock 's here .
KIRSTY: Okay . Cubic root of nine thousand two hundred and sixty one .
TREVOR: Twenty one . Why do we have to do this now Kirsty ?
KIRSTY: Shut up and play darling . Your turn .
TREVOR: Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four .
KIRSTY: Uh eighty two ?
TREVOR: Eighty four .
KIRSTY: You win ! Okay pull over .
TREVOR: But I thought
KIRSTY: If what I 've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time . Besides we 've got a whole seven minutes efore the next one . Clock 's ticking . Tick-tock
KIRSTY'S VOICE: Honey what 's wrong ? Kirsty rises INTO FRAME once again .
TREVOR: What is n't wrong ? Why are you doing this anyway ?
KIRSTY: I 'm I 'm doing a very special thing here . And you ca n't even respond ?
TREVOR: Sorry honey the present situation is n't exactly fodder for an erection . Should n't we be getting to the hospital ?
KIRSTY: I was going to keep breathing you know . You think I 'm an amateur or something ?
TREVOR: Just concentrate on the task at hand please . Listen to me . You should be giving ME this lecture .
KIRSTY: You 've been cheating on me have n't you ?
TREVOR: Yes I had a quickie with the neighbo during your last contraction .
KIRSTY: Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives ' first pregnancy .
TREVOR: I would never cheat on you . Not while you 're pregnant now you know that .
KIRSTY: Okay uh oh here comes another one .
TREVOR: Share the pain Kirsty .
KIRSTY: Oh God Trevor , I think my wate just broke . Trevor grabs the wheel again . Kirsty GASPS .

TREVOR: Kristy ! Kristy ! Trevor drops to his knee 's in distress . TREVOR Oh my God , Kristy ! Please Kristy . I 'm so sorry , Kristy .
TREVOR: What are you people doing ? !
CHIEF SURGEON: As you can see I just accessed the speech center , temporarily shutting down all verbal ability .
ANGELIC WOMAN: Well ? What do say Trevor ? Que pasa ?
TREVOR: Where do I start ?
ANGELIC WOMAN: How 's the old noggin ? Any change in the intensity ? She touches him gently . ANGELIC WOMAN Can you describe the pains ?
TREVOR: I 'm not sure . How about a jackhammer in the Occipital lobe ?
TREVOR: Are you a dream too ?
ALLISON: Still hallucinating as well . Hmm
TREVOR: What just happened to me anyway ? It looked like a dream but it felt like eality .
ALLISON: It 's the morphine Trevor . You 're on so much of it , you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open .
TREVOR: Where 's Kirsty ? Where 's my wife ?
ALLISON: Your wife ?
AMBROSE: Well I ca n't find any abnormalities . I think we 're ready for discharge .
ALLISON: But , Dr. Ambrose-
AMBROSE: I think it 's time to ween you off these painkillers too . Would n't want you to develop a dependency to them . You might do things like come to the hospital fo no reason other than to get a fix , would n't you ?
ALLISON: Well looks like you 're going home ! Hope you brought your bus pass .
TREVOR: Do you kids mind keeping it down ? The creepy old woman speaks up .
OLD WOMAN: Aww let them be . They 're only kids .
BRET: Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today ?
TREVOR: Hey Bret . Christ , my head feels like a split coconut .
BRET: Dude there is a track on the carpet etween here and the bathroom . It was made by your ass . You 've been dragging it all fucking week . What happened to you yesterday ?
TREVOR: Give me a break . I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things .
BRET: Hospital ? You have n't been to the hospital since uh
TREVOR: Since what ?
BRET: Look never mind . Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due . The hills have eyes remember ?
PINHEAD: It 's too late .
WOMAN: SNAP OUT OF IT !
GWEN: Jesus what the hell was that ? It 's like you saw a ghost or something .
TREVOR: Sorry I just kind of spaced for a second there .
GWEN: Well do n't let it happen again . Or I may have to spank you .
TREVOR: Please , Gwen . You're- you 're all over me .
GWEN: How do you think you got this job , cock ? Mmm . I 'm still tingling all over from ou little midnight swim .
TREVOR: Nothing , look . Gwen I really like you-
GWEN: And it shows . Least it did last night at the quarry . In a big way . Trevor gently pushes her off him again .
TREVOR: Please you 're going way too fast for me here .
GWEN: YOU 'RE giving ME a speeding ticket ? Mr. Mario Andretti himself ?
TREVOR: Gwen , my wife 's dead .
GWEN: Oh I see . That again . Trevor ? I realize it must be hard . But Christ how long does it take someone to move on ?
TREVOR: That was cold
GWEN: No , making another woman compete with someone who 's been dead eight months . That 's cold .
TREVOR: I 'm sorry Gwen . I do n't know what 's happening to me . I think it 's the painkillers , really .
GWEN: Why do n't you let me take you out tonight ? I promise to make it the most memorable night of your life .
TREVOR: You got Trevor .
MAN'S VOICE: Trevor hi this is Detective Lange from homicide . It 's about your wife . Push in on to a bewildered Trevor .
LANGE: Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding . Has your head healed okay by now ?
TREVOR: Where 's my wife ?
LANGE: Okay then . Here 's the scoop .
TREVOR: What evidence ?
LANGE: For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge , the tires were all intact , from what we could tell , nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either . Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally .
TREVOR: It should all in the report . I told you guys everything . She was giving birth in the fucking car . She grabbed the wheel and I lost control .
LANGE: I did read that , yes . What hospital were you going to ? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge is n't exactly on the way to Mercy General .
TREVOR: Why would n't I tell you everything ? Look , I 've been fully cooperative to my recollection .
LANGE: I 'm sorry Mr. Gooding , I meant no disrespect . I 'm just doing my job here , OK ? I mean between your head injury and the fact that you are on very strong pain medication , you might not be remembering a few details about the crash which might help us here . Lange takes a deep hit of the nasal spray . LANGE What you 're recalling could be a fabrication you 've made up about it . Do you follow ?
TREVOR: Kirsty . Jesus , wake up ! This time she does n't wake up .
LANGE: Mr. Gooding ? You still in there ?
TREVOR: Uhh . Yes detective , sorry . Just trying to ecollect , you know ? Lange nods .
LANGE'S VOICE: That 's a start . I 'll tell the people trawling the river maybe it makes a difference maybe not . Thanks for you help Trevor . If we have any more questions you 'll get a call from myself or my partner Detective Givens .
TREVOR: You guys know something I do n't ?
LANGE: All things considered we probably know a lot less than you do . Have a good afternoon , Mr. Gooding .
GOTHIC WOMAN: Here it is , what do you think ?
TREVOR: Oh . Uh it 's beautiful . I 'm sorry , I 've just been having a weird day
TAWNY: I totally understand . Listen I do n't know if you 're into incense but , I bought some , it 's called Witching Hour . To inhale it is to love it . I mean the stuff 'll clear your head big time . Come on over , I 'll burn some for you . If you ca n't sleep tonight She jabs a thumb down the hall behind her .
TREVOR: No , thanks I 've got a a date tonight-
TAWNY: Whew . You bounce right back do n't you ?
TREVOR: What do you mean ?
TAWNY: Did n't your like whole life get totalled last week ?
TREVOR: Last week
TAWNY: The car accident ? Any of this ringing a ell ? Trevor eyes her nervously then
TREVOR: It 's not that kind of date .
TAWNY: Hey even if it is more power to ya . Alrighty then . Have a good time .
KIRSTY: Well Trevor . It 's been one year . Three hundred sixty five days .
KIRSTY: How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes fo a whole year .
TREVOR: But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
KIRSTY: There is no wisdom , no insight , no plan
KIRSTY: I only married you for your body .
TREVOR: Hello ? Who 's out there ?
GWEN: Sorry I 'm late dear .
TREVOR: Gwen you scared the living shit out of me .
GWEN: You are turning into an old fuddy duddy . Shoe . Gwen puts one foot on his chest .
TREVOR: What ?
GWEN: Our little toy . You usually have it up and running by now .
TREVOR: Do I really want to know what you 're talking about ?
GWEN: You 're kidding me .
TREVOR: I 'm sorry Gwen . I just ca n't .
GWEN: You have definitely got a screw loose , Trevor . Goodbye .
TREVOR: What the hell ?
VIDEO GWEN: There 's one thing I should have told you ight from the beginning Trevor .
TREVOR: No !
ALLISON: Sorry I thought you were going to stay under longer .
TREVOR: What 's happening to me ? What are you doing ?
ALLISON: You came in for your EEG . You fell asleep and well , I took the liberty ofI 'm sorry . You looked like a wreck Trevor . Trevor seems to like the attention .
TREVOR: I just had the most vivid dream . I was sure I was dying .
ALLISON: Well you can relax now you are quite alive . And as long as you 're awake , chin up .
TREVOR: Let me see . Oh yeah . My head feels like it 's going through a meat grinder . I 'm not sure if I 'm dreaming or
TREVOR: Your insight is enlightening .
ALLISON: No wisdom , no insight , no plan . Allison gives him a wink , disarming Trevor .
TREVOR: My wife said that exact same sentence to me the day we got married . She even winked too . Allison smiles and puts her hand on his .
ALLISON: Do you use this wife thing to hit on all the interns ?
TREVOR: No just you . Allison wipes his face clean with a towel .
ALLISON: There . Just like a baby 's butt .
TREVOR: Allison ? Why ca n't remember what happened to my wife ? Is it something I 'm on that 's that 's making me forget ?
ALLISON: Easy there Trevor . You need to relax .
TREVOR: No I need to remember . Look whatever it is take me off it . I can handle pain . I ca n't handle not knowing
ALLISON: You need to get better first Trevor . Way etter . It 's okay to miss somebody . It 's okay to still love someone after they 're gone . But you 've got to quit blaming yourself okay ? Okay ?
TREVOR: Shit , I 'm gon na be late !
BRET: Must be nice .
TREVOR: What ?
BRET: Getting paid for doing shit .
TREVOR: Come on , Bret .
BRET: Seriously man , you oughta work for the government . You 've got the sense of urgency for it .
TREVOR: Look , I 'm doing my best considering okay ?
BRET: Hey if the boss does n't notice who cares ight ? Just slack all the live long day if you want .
TREVOR: The boss wo n't notice me doing a bad jo ecause I 'm not . Even if the boss thought I was slacking I 'd know right away .
BRET: Yeah , how 's that ?
TREVOR: I have my connections
BRET: Really ? Do tell .
TREVOR: Gwen .
BRET: GWEN ?
TREVOR: I crap you not . She was all over me yesterday in the break room . And she was a total machine last night too .
BRET: You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night ? GWEN DEARDON ? The supervisor ?
TREVOR: Serious as a heart attack my friend . I think she literally fucked me brains out .
BRET: Wow that 's quite a feat Trevo congratulations . Must be really tough to get your brains fucked out by a CORPSE . Trevor stops and looks at Bret .
TREVOR: What are you talking about ?
BRET: Me ? This is your sick joke man . Gwen was murdered here six months ago . The security guard found her all over he office . Her head was in the waste pape asket . Her stomach was in the filing cabinet . Her ass was on the copy machine Trevor is speechless .
TREVOR: Jesus Christ
BRET: Man are you ever out of the loop . Eithe that or you 've got the worst sense of humor this side of Jeffrey Dahmer . What is your problem anyway ?
TREVOR: Honestly Bret ? I think I lost my mind . And now I 'm finding pieces of it , like pieces of a wrecked car , scattered on the side of the road . A beat .
BRET: Bud you need to decompress . I told you you came back to work too soon after the accident . Trevor says nothing .
SAGE: These headaches you 've been getting . Do they happen in conjunction with the hallucinations ?
TREVOR: Yes , sort of .
SAGE: Dreams ?
TREVOR: I was going to say dimensions . But I guess technically they are dreams .
SAGE: You should always listen to you subconscious . It 's trying to tell you something about your waking life .
TREVOR: I 'm thinking this might just be what I needed .
PINHEAD: No matter what happens just remember
ALLISON: Shh . It 's okay . Go back to sleep . Allison blurs out of focus
DARKENED MAN: I know . Divorce is n't good enough . Abandonment is n't good enough . There 's only one way to do it and do it cleanly , without leaving a trace of evidence .
RECEPTIONIST: Afternoon doll-face . Hey , a police detective was just here to see you . Some guy named Givens .
TREVOR: Uh thanks this looks a little important . Could you let the folks upstairs know I 'll be late ?
RECEPTIONIST: For you bubbalicious ? I 'd lay across a bed of nails .
TREVOR: I 'm sorry . I still I do n't understand how this is a homicide case . I mean nobody was murdered here Her body 's een missing for I do n't know how long now and
GIVENS: What did you just say ?
TREVOR: I said she 's been missing for-
GIVENS: No . No you said HER BODY 's been missing .
TREVOR: What 's the difference ?
GIVENS: Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive . You seem to certain she 's dead .
TREVOR: I saw her drowning inside the car , detective .
GIVENS: I read up on you , man . You 're a smart guy are n't you ? I mean with numbers . Right ?
TREVOR: You could say that .
GIVENS: Zero 's a number right ?
TREVOR: As in one minus one equals zero yes . Where are you going with this ?
GIVENS: How many zeros was your wife worth ? Brow furrowing , Trevor stands up .
TREVOR: I need to talk to my attorney . Now .
BRET: I do n't know what pissed you off but it 's nice to see you getting the job done fo a change .
WOMAN'S VOICE: I 'M SAVED ! MY HERO !
ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE: -at the dawning of the agrarian age goat 's milk would be considered a suitable substitute for a mother 's breast milk . And the sacrifice of a goat would appease an angry god and ensure a ountiful harvest . But in time the ritual would become associated with less hallowed purposes .
TAWNY: Hey . Can I borrow something ?
TREVOR: Uh sure , Tawny what ?
TAWNY: You .
TREVOR: Tawny ? What's- what are you doing ?
TAWNY: YOU !
TREVOR: I 'm , uh , not sure Feeling kind of weird actually .
TAWNY: Really ?
TREVOR: I 've never said this to a woman before ut ca n't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other ?
TAWNY: God . Sometimes you can be such an animal . Other times you are the ultimate tease
TREVOR: Wow . That 's good . Lots of capers , huh ?
TAWNY: For starters . It 's also got fennel , asparagus , olives , some more of mothe nature 's aphrodisiacs Back in college , me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew .
TREVOR: Not a very appetizing name .
TAWNY: Have some more . Trevor takes another sip of it .
TREVOR: You must have been very proud of yourselves
TAWNY: It 's getting hot in here .
TREVOR: Jesus who did that to you ? Tawny BUSTS OUT LAUGHING .
TAWNY: You 're kidding right ? Trevor shakes his head no .
TREVOR: Tawny I think I 'm going to be sick .
TAWNY: Well now there 's a compliment .
ALLISON: Sorry about that . There was a blockage in your oxygen hose . Wo n't happen again , promise .
TREVOR: I 'm certainly keeping you busy huh ?
ALLISON: Too bad I hate my job She strokes his forehead .
TREVOR: These hallucinations I 'm having . I think they 're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way .
ALLISON: Well that 's not necessarily a bad thing is it ?
TREVOR: If they 're blocked memories I 'm starting to realize the reason why I locked them out . Allison I think I eally screwed everything up .
ALLISON: Shh . Do n't blame yourself Trevor . Please .
TREVOR: I miss her . I miss my wife .
ALLISON: If you need to cry , go ahead . I wo n't tell .
LANGE'S VOICE: This is Lange . We need to talk as soon as possible . It 's about your little dilemma . Give me a call .
TAWNY: Can I help you ?
TREVOR: Tawny I- you're-
TAWNY: Whoa , I have serious space issues , dude . What do you want ?
TREVOR: I think we need to talk , there 's something really strange going on
TAWNY: Hey you 're the guy from down the hall .
TREVOR: Come on , quit fucking around . Listen it 's about what we did together last night .
VOICE: Who the fuck is that ?
TAWNY: It 's that guy from down the hall . He thinks we did something with him last night .
TREVOR: Who's- who 's in there with you ? Tawny looks aghast .
TAWNY: Are you cracking up or something ?
BRUTE: What can we do for you , chief ?
TREVOR: I who are you ?
BRUTE: You know Tawny , you better know me , pal .
TREVOR: Okay . I do n't want any trouble . I was mistaken I 'll see you later .
BRUTE: Much .
TREVOR: You already asked me that ten minutes ago just before you put me on hold . I 'm looking for defective- I mean Detective Lange .
OPERATOR: Oh he and his partner just stepped out to lunch , can I- ? Trevor hangs up .
TREVOR: Just open the doors I 'll jump off .
BUS DRIVER: Not while the bus is moving , sir .
TREVOR: Where 's my wife Detective Lange ? What the hell did you do with her ? !
LANGE: Mr. Gooding I assure you we are doing everything within our-
TREVOR: Why did you leave me that message ?
LANGE: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
TREVOR: LIAR !
LARRY: Basically they know where your wife 's ody is and they 're not telling you as a tactic to get you to confess ? Yet neithe of them has come out and told you that you 're a suspect . Is that what you 're trying to say ?
TREVOR: Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me . And I know this all sounds a little fucked up .
LARRY: A little ? Try unbelievably .
TREVOR: I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me . I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too .
LARRY: Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected .
TREVOR: Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse , a direct relative or a close friend that 's common knowledge . But this was n't murder it was an accident-
LARRY: And as far as hiding a body goes ? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim 's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess . It 's absolutely preposterous . Now I 'm not saying I do n't believe you , I'm.ambiguous . There 's quite alot of money behind all this .
TREVOR: How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead ?
LARRY: Rosie can you bring in the Gooding papers ?
ASSISTANT'S VOICE: Right away Mr. Ellis .
TREVOR: Uh . Ballpark would be fine Larry .
LARRY: In the vicinity of eight million fou hundred fifty thousand . Or is it sixty-
TREVOR: What happens if I 'm convicted of Kirsty 's murder ?
LARRY: Well they 'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
TREVOR: Please Larry . Pretend you like me and humor me .
LARRY: Seeing you were her sole benefactor , and I 'm the executive of the will , Kirsty 's entire estate would have to be donated to the city .
TREVOR: Hello ? City ? Cops ? It 's a fucking conspiracy !
LARRY: Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic . The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type . You 're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse .
TREVOR: Thanks for your concern Larry . And fuck you too . Trevor gets up and heads for the door .
LARRY: I never thought your late wife was the sharpest knife in the drawer . But marrying you was the dumbest thing she ever did !
TREVOR: You can go . I 'm going to be here a while .
ALLISON: Jesus I wish you would stop doing that .
TREVOR: Allison Trevor tries to put his thoughts together .
ALLISON: Well Trevor ? What have you got to say fo yourself ? Que pasa ?
TREVOR: Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you 've got me on .
ALLISON: I 'm all over it . Allison shines a penlight in his eye .
TREVOR: Really ? Does it affect the memory ?
ALLISON: You 're one tough cookie , Trevor Gooding . You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round .
TREVOR: Some call it resilience . Others , stupidity .
ALLISON: Of course , yes .
TREVOR: The way you just looked at me
ALLISON: I know , my bedside manner 's horrendous .
TREVOR: So , I 'm done . Thats it for today ?
ALLISON: All finished . Neither of them want this visit to be over . TREVOR How bout some lunch ?
TREVOR: Think about it . In the entire world where 's the most life-threatening place you could possibly be at any given moment .
ALLISON: I do n't know Beirut ? New Orleans ?
TREVOR: Hint . It 's not a geographical location .
ALLISON: I 'm stumped .
TREVOR: It 's inside a moving car .
ALLISON: Bull
TREVOR: I 've got numbers to back me up . Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II .
ALLISON: Okay so what 's the safest place ?
TREVOR: Statistically speaking ? Inside a moving us . Allison LAUGHS .
ALLISON: Okay Mr. Statistics I 've got one for you . What 's the most common cause of death fo adults over the age of eighteen ?
TREVOR: Please . Heart attack . That was easy street .
ALLISON: Second most common ?
TREVOR: Skin cancer .
ALLISON: Eighty third most common .
TREVOR: Pitbull attacks .
ALLISON: You just made that up .
TREVOR: Like you 're gon na check .
ALLISON: Where you two happy together ?
TREVOR: We startred off to be . She was , I guess I was . I just sort of.butchered up the elationship somehow . Bad choice of words .
ALLISON: I understand , I think . Other women ?
TREVOR: Yeah . It 's like I was a different guy then I am today . I ca n't remember that guy . I see these women , they think I 'm someone else , and I 'm not that guy anymore . I 'm not sure who Kristy knew .
ALLISON: You were unfaithful , it sounds like you confessing .
TREVOR: I did more then that .
ALLISON: Com'on . How bout some fresh air ?
TREVOR: Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here .
ALLISON: Oh I knew about the chairs already . This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes .
TREVOR: No . She just would have loved it up here Allison when I was under did I ever talk ?
ALLISON: Sure plenty of times .
TREVOR: Was there anything I said that made you stop and wonder , you know , `` where did that come from ? ''
ALLISON: Sure plenty of times .
TREVOR: Well ?
ALLISON: Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming . So practically everything say is going to sound strange .
TREVOR: Did I ever talk about the accident ?
ALLISON: No .
TREVOR: Did I ever talk about Kirsty ?
ALLISON: No . But at one point you did repeat something though . A phrase . You must have een having this recurring dream , you just kept saying this one thing over and ove
TREVOR: What was it ?
ALLISON: You said , `` Jealousy arouses a husbands fury , and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge . '' Does that mean anything to you Trevor ?
TREVOR: It means I have alot more questions . Trevor stares off into the distance .
ALLISON: Times up for today . I 've got to get back .
ALLISON: If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had . Trevor , I never date patients .
TREVOR: I understand I won't-
ALLISON: No you do n't understand . That 's why I 've een fighting to get you better . So you would n't be a patient anymore .

LANGE: You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that ca accident were n't you ?
TREVOR: Where is she ? Where is my wife ?
LANGE: We found this curious little object not too far from the site of the accident . No prints but forensics scraped a little dark residue that was caked on one of the corners . It was blood Trevor . Matched some blood we took off your car seat too . Can you tell me anything about it ?
TREVOR: It looks familiar . I think it was in the car
LANGE: Gee you think so ?
TREVOR: What ?
LANGE: The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall ? She wanted you arrested for harassment . I told her to chill out and smoke a joint . I 'd look the other way as long as she did you know ?
TREVOR: Thanks .
LANGE: We 're all here for you Trevor .
BRET: Frogurt guy 's here . They 're all out chocolate vanilla swirl or I 'd have gotten you one .
TREVOR: I 'm sure you would have .
BRET: Hey if you 're not doing anything I 'd like to buy you a beer after work . Be just like old times .
TREVOR: What 's the occasion ?
BRET: I quit . Today 's my last day . This hits Trevor like a ton of bricks .
TREVOR: How much time off ?
BRET: As much as he feels like . Its a much more pleasurable line of work .
TREVOR: As much as he likes ?
BRET: Yahtzee . Were all in this together Trev . Trevor there are people who are doing exactly what we 're doing but they do n't need to wear a tie , punch a clock or have some tight assed supervisor breathing down their necks . Its all about the pleasure Trevor !
TREVOR: So you 're just packing it up just like that ?
BRET: Almost that fast . I got a few loose ends to tie up first . Came into a shitload of money recently . I 've always wanted to go to take a trip . We 're just gon na walk into the airport and decide right then and there .

WIMPERING VOICE: Goodbye
TREVOR: Kirsty ?
WIMPERING VOICE: You miserable sonofabitch !
SAGE'S VOICE: Hello ?
TREVOR: Sage it 's me Trevor . You 've got to help me .
SAGE: Trevor your body has been completely healed . All the nerve endings have epaired themselves . If there is any pain in your head it 's in your head .
TREVOR: Jeez it 's getting awful crowded in there .
SAGE: You are physically better . It 's your soul that still hurts . Sage grabs a bunch of needles from the table .
TREVOR: Look , whatever your Marharagi , told you , forget . You 've got to get this fuckin pain to stop .
SAGE: It was an analogy . Your soul is locked up inside you . You need to free it Trevor . You 've blocked it from the healing process . That 's what we need to do now . Heal your soul . And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt . Do you know what I mean by giving in ? It 's about trust . Do you trust me implicitly ?
TREVOR: I do n't even know what 's real and what is n't how can I trust anyone ?
SAGE: You can trust me . Your wife is dead and you need to move past that . And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it , not around it . Surrender yourself to your wife 's death . Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side . It 's the only way you can become whole again . Sage looks Trevor dead in the eye .
TREVOR: I surrender Trevor closes his eyes
SAGE: Surrender yourself surrende yourself
TREVOR: Kirsty Kirsty ?
KIRSTY: It 's okay it was just a nightmare that 's all .

PARAMEDIC: Can you hear me ? Just nod . Trevor nods .
TREVOR: Ambulance .
PARAMEDIC: We 're just gon na take some blood here .
TREVOR: Two .
PARAMEDIC: Can you follow them ?
TREVOR: You mean when the car went off the idge ?
PARAMEDIC: Wow you are out of it .
TREVOR: No maybe I do n't know .
PARAMEDIC: It 's cool . Here we are . The ambulance comes to a stop .
DR. AMBROSE: Hello I 'm Dr
TREVOR: Ambrose . I know .
DR. AMBROSE: Have we met ?
TREVOR: I 've been in here before .
DR. AMBROSE: Take no offense Trevor . I see many patients a day and have an awful memory .
TREVOR: Join the club .
TREVOR: Where 's Allison ? Dr. Ambrose looks a little confused .
DR. AMBROSE: Who 's Allison ?
TREVOR: Allison Dormere . Your intern .
DR. AMBROSE: Uh we have no intern by that name here Mr. Gooding . Listen I 'll be back in a few hours to check up on you meantime relax try not to move around too much .
NURSE: There there Trevor . Get some sleep . Trevor tenses when the nurse smiles .
TREVOR: Do n't tell me . ëWe 're all here for you Trevor ' right ? Go ahead say it ! You know you want to ! The nurse looks taken aback .
NURSE: What the hell are you talking about ?
DR. AMBROSE: Hey !
OLD MAN: Okay ya caught me .
TREVOR: I do n't work here .
OLD MAN: Music to my ears .
ALLISON: Trevor . I heard you were looking for me . Is everything all right ?
TREVOR: Allison ! Am I glad to see you ! No everything 's not right . Not at all .
ALLISON: Come here .
TREVOR: Allison I think I did some very , very bad things . I mean very bad .
ALLISON: Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss . Everybody does things they regret . You just could n't remember doing these things and now you are so it 's a shock to the system . I 'm telling you . You will neve get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife 's death .
TREVOR: Maybe I was n't responsible for the ca accident The old man calls out to Trevor wheezily .
OLD MAN: Hey buddy !
TREVOR: but I 'm starting to think I was I was going to
OLD MAN: Hey buddy ! Trevor turns to the old man .
TREVOR: What do you want ? !
OLD MAN: Who the hell are you talking to ?
BUS DRIVER: This is it mister .
TREVOR: I do n't know what I 'm doing here . I 'm not even Catholic . I just had to tell somebody . It 's like , ever since my wife died I do n't know what I 've actually done or what I 've imagined . But I do know if one tenth of what 's happening to me is eality I 've done some really awful things in my life . Things that I 've I guess I 've blocked out
PRIEST: What things do you think you 've done ?
TREVOR: Wow . Let 's see . So many sins so little time . For starters I was responsible fo the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child . That was so I could collect her eight million dolla estate . I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind he ack .
PRIEST: Trevor I 'm sure you killed no one . You are very distraught over your wife 's death and rightfully so . You did the ight thing by confessing to me here tonight . And you should keep praying fo the wisdom that will set your soul at ease . That being said , you are still in a highly emotional state right now . It might do you some good to get some professional help . Confess to them the way you confessed to me . In time you 'll probably find that the real killer has already been caught . Or better yet that these murders never happened at all .
TREVOR: But I saw these women . I saw thei mutilated bodies . I saw their ghosts . I just know it happened I can feel it
PRIEST: All you 've got is the here and the now Trevor . That 's all anyone really has . Maybe this will make things easier to understand . A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he 's a utterfly . In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he 's a man . And at the end of the day does it even matter ? All these events you 're describing . How can you be sure any of them really happened ?
TREVOR: But that 's what I need . To be sure to e absolutely sure
PRIEST: Shh . It 's okay son . There is but one truth . One thing you can be absolutely sure of . And that thing is this The priest moves closer to the screen .
PINHEAD: Still in the dark I see ?
TREVOR: Who are you ?
PINHEAD: Poor Trevor .
TREVOR: This game is over do you hear me ?
PINHEAD: I hear everything . And soon you will know everything . More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that . But I want you to think for a minute first . Think about all you 've seen . All the clues you 've been given .
TREVOR: WHERE 'S MY WIFE ? !
BRET: Tonight was supposed to be the night , Trevor . Remember ? I could n't believe you went through five dart games and did n't even joke about it .
TREVOR: Bret . What the hell is going on ?
BRET: We were gon na be millionaires you said . Nobody 'd suspect a thing . I had neve even met her . No connection . Then you went and had that fucking car accident .
TREVOR: Bret you are making no sense whatsoever .
BRET: I followed her Trevor . I got to know he life . And what a boring one it was . Six a.m. gym , nine a.m. trendy coffee shop , noon bookstore , one soap operas , fou o'clock news , five wait for Trevor to come home . And wait and wait and wait . Nine o'clock get ready for bed .
TREVOR: No !
LANGE: Okay Trevor . Put the knife down .
COP#1: Full name ?
TREVOR: Trevor Alan Gooding .
COP#1: Age ?
TREVOR: Thirty one .
HAPLESS SOUL: I told you I do n't know !
DETECTIVE#1: Wrong answer !
COP#1: Single file .
MAN: We 're all here for you Trevor .
COP#1: NO TALKING !
LANGE'S VOICE: Stop and face the mirror !
BRUTE: I hope they fry your ass mutherfucker !
COP#1: Got quite a fan club do n't you , hotshot ?
TREVOR: For the last time . I honestly do n't know how any of them died
GIVENS: Now I want you to tell me what you emember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange . But this time I want you to make one small adjustment .
TREVOR: What 's that ?
LANGE: DO N'T FUCKING LIE TO ME !
TREVOR: I did it . I killed them all . I confess .
LANGE: Quick detour through the morgue boys . Lange leads them to a set of elevators .
TREVOR: Morgue ?
LANGE: That 's right Trevor . The timing was impeccable was n't it ? It 's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body . Just need you to ID it for us .
TREVOR: Where was it ?
LANGE: Just keep walking Trevor . You ca n't miss it .
PINHEAD: How is our little student doing ? Has he learned his lesson yet ?
TREVOR: I do n't know who you are or what you want . I just want to know what 's unde that sheet
PINHEAD: Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor . Think about people for a change . People other than yourself . Like the women you slept with behind you wife 's back . You were always so confident you had covered your tracks . Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials ? Part of you must have known she would find out . flaSH BACK
PINHEAD: Even a mind as narcissistic as yours must have wondered What unspeakable acts was your wife committing behind YOUR ack ?
KIRSTY: Goodbye you miserable sonofabitch ! And SLAMMING a rock down on us . acK TO
TREVOR: What 's under that sheet ?
PINHEAD: You probably do n't remember the night we played . Your first year as husband and wife . flASH BACK
TREVOR: WHAT 'S UNDER THE SHEET ?
PINHEAD: Welcome to the worst nightmare of them all , Trevor . Reality . Pinhead grabs the sheet and whips it back . Trevor 's jaw drops in disbelief .
LANGE: Open this and your problem will disappea forever . And no one will ever suspect you .
KIRSTY: Shhh it 's okay .
KIRSTY'S VOICE: Yes . Yes that 's him .
LANGE: Well I guess that 's it then . Thank you Mrs. Gooding I realize that must have een tough .
DR. AMBROSE: Alrighty . Let 's get started folks .
SAGE: Collecting 40ccs of serum
AMBROSE: Examining cranial fracture
ALLISON: Looks like an eel of some kind .
AMBROSE: Guess it was murder after all .
SAGE: Yeah all we need is the eel 's motive .
ALLISON: I still do n't get it . He 's been missing for almost eight months . But this body has n't been dead more than twenty fou hours .
DR. AMBROSE: Makes you wonder what he was up to etween the time he disappeared and when he died . Allison walks right up to the corpse 's face .
ALLISON: Well ? What do you say Trevor ? Que pasa ?
DR. AMBROSE: Allison what on earth possesses you to converse with cadavers ?
SAGE: It 's simple , Dr. Ambrose . What if there is no afterlife ? What happens when we die ? Do we just stay stuck inside you odies for eternity watching ourselves decompose ?
AMBROSE: I 'm not following this
ALLISON: Well if that 's the case would n't you want someone to talk to you like a normal human being one last time ?
AMBROSE: You two are creeping me out . And I 'm a coroner .
KIRSTY: I would have come in sooner but I had an important errand to run last night . Out of town . Figures you 'd find his body the minute I decide to go off somewhere .
LANGE: Well you made it down here that 's the important part . Thank you for you patience Mrs. Gooding .
KIRSTY: Of course . That was my last anniversary present to him .
LANGE: A token to remember him by now . Goodbye Mrs. Gooding . She takes the cube .
KIRSTY: Thank you detective .
LARRY: Looking for someone , Kirsty ?
KIRSTY: You bet I was .
NANNY: Lactose intolerance . I 've stocked the fridge with Lactaid .
KIRSTY: See you in a couple of weeks . You 've got my cell number right ?
LARRY: Daisy is getting so big . I still ca n't believe HE was her father . Kirsty smiles to herself .
KIRSTY: Counselor can we not mention HIM anymore . Can we just start spending HIS money instead . They walk slowly toward the curb .
LARRY: I 've always wanted to go to Madagascar .
KIRSTY: You mean the place with bats ?
LARRY: They 're called flying lemurs .
KIRSTY: Yeah that sounds like a real blast They put their arms around each other . KIRSTY I 've been thinking about it . This has to have been the best eight months of my life . Larry sees a cab and rushes out to hail it .
LANGE: You forgot something .
KIRSTY: Oh . Thank you . Kirsty takes the cube .
GIVENS: Thank YOU .
LARRY: After you my dear .
KIRSTY: Time , Larry . Time 's up .

HILLY: He ca n't get off the rig , Skeeter . It 's offshore ! Stuart is a very successful oil man .
SKEETER: I 'm starting to think this Stuart is a figment of your imagination .
ELIZABETH: Raleigh called his cousin down in Hattiesburg . He 'll drive up .
SKEETER: The cousin with one eye ? ! Elizabeth nods .
HILLY: One eye ? !

SKEETER: Good luck down there , Carlton .
CARLTON: Have fun at the dance , Skeete Legs .
CHARLOTTE: Eugenia ! You 've grown another inch since breakfast . Go put on a dress that fits before that boy and his daddy come pick you up .
CONSTANTINE: Gone be just you and me all weekend .
SKEETER: I just could n't tell her I did n't get asked to the dance .
CONSTANTINE: Some things we should just keep to ourselves . Skeeter looks down to her long , bony legs .
SKEETER: I 'm already taller than the boys ' asketball coach . How tall are you , Constantine ?
CONSTANTINE: I 'm five-thirteen , so quit feeling sorry for yourself .
SKEETER: Momma was third runner up in the Miss South Carolina pageant .
CONSTANTINE: `` Miss '' what ? Shoot , Child ! You gone be `` Miss Something Better . ''
SKEETER: What about you ? What did you want to be , Constantine ? Constantine laughs .
CONSTANTINE: Oh , Child ! We do n't get to pick . This pick us , and that just how it is .
JOLENE: Sunny skies and a high of ninety- eight today with ninety-nine percent humidity . There 's a slight chance of afternoon showers so y'all carry an umbrella .
MISS STEIN: What gave you this idea , Miss Phelan ? I'mcurious .
SKEETER: I waswell , I was raised by a colored woman . I 've seen how simple it can be andwell , how complex it can be , toobetween the families and the help .
MISS STEIN: Continue .
SKEETER: I 'd like to write something from the point of view of the help . These colored women raise white children , and then twenty years later those children become the employer . It 's that irony , Miss Stein , that we love them and they love us yetwe do n't even let them use the toilet in the house .
MISS STEIN: I 'm listening .
SKEETER: Margaret Mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates he whole life to a white family but no oneever asked Mammy how she felt about it . There is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love , but nobody eve talks about it down here .
MISS STEIN: So , a side to this never before heard .
SKEETER: Yes ! Charlotte knocks on the pantry door .
MISS STEIN: Who was that ?
SKEETER: My mother . She just dropped by to-
MISS STEIN: Look , no maid in her right mind would ever tell you the truth . That 's a hell of a risk in a place like Jackson , Mississippi . I watched them try to integrate you us station on the news . Oy ! They jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail uilt for four . Skeeter panics .
SKEETER: I already have a maid .
MISS STEIN: Really ? A negro maid has already agreed to talk to you ? Skeeter blinks hard . No turning back now .
SKEETER: Yes , ma'am
MISS STEIN: WellI suppose I could read what you come up with . The book biz could use a little rattling .
SKEETER: You 'd do that ?
MISS STEIN: I 'm saying I 'll let you know if it 's even worth pursuing .
SKEETER: Oh , thank you , Miss Stein !
MISS STEIN: And for God 's sake , you 're a twenty- four-year-old educated woman . Go get an apartment . She hangs up .
SKEETER: `` Dear Miss Myrna , How do I remove the rings from my fat , slovenly husband 's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too ''
AIBILEEN: Which one she want a get rid of ? Them rings or the husband ? Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders .
HILLY: Build it just like the one at my house , right against the garage .
SKEETER: Aibileen , do you ever wish you couldchange things ? Aibileen turns slowly from the window .
AIBILEEN: Everthing 's fine .
SKEETER: My momma fired Constantine . Thank you for telling me that .
AIBILEEN: I never tolt you that !
SKEETER: Aibileen , I have an ideaSomething I want to write aboutBut I need your help . Skeeter rises .
AIBILEEN: You know what 'd happen to me if Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin ' stories on her ?
SKEETER: I was thinking we would n't tell her . The other maids will have to keep it secret , too .
AIBILEEN: Other maids ?
SKEETER: I was hoping to get four or five . To really show what it 's like in Jackson . To see what y'all get paid , the babies , the bathrooms , the good and the bad . Aibileen shakes her head .
AIBILEEN: They set my cousin Shinelle 's ca on fire just cause she went down to the voting station .
SKEETER: A book has never been written like this , Aibileen .
AIBILEEN: ` Cause they 's a reason . I do this with you , I might as well burn my own house down . Bam ! The front door slams shut .
RALEIGH: I put up with the new clothes and all the damn trips to New Orleans , ut this takes the goddamn cake !
ELIZABETH: It 'll confuse Mae Mobley if she sees Aibileen going inside . And we ca n't risk her health .
RALEIGH: Great ! Mae Mobley can just go to college in that bathroom , too .
ELIZABETH: Honey , Hilly 's covering the costand said you can just do William 's taxes to pay her back .
RALEIGH: We do n't take orders from the Holbrooks !
SKEETER: Fine .
RALEIGH: Fix me a sandwich , Aibileen .
ELIZABETH: Aibileen , Mae Mobley 's crying he eyes out !
MISSUS WALTERS: You 're making it a lot hotte flapping your arm like that .
HILLY: That should do it . Minny , go get me and Momma some iced tea . Minny hesitates . She gulps .
MINNY: UhMiss Hilly ?
HILLY: Yes .
MINNY: Never mind .
MISSUS WALTERS: You go on ahead and use the guest ath , Minny . It 's okay .
HILLY: Oh , for crying out loud . It 's just a little rain . She can go get an umbrella up in William 's Study !

AIBILEEN: This already ai n't careful , Miss Skeeter . You not knowing that is what scares me most . I 'm sorry .
MINNY: Oh , Aibileen ! I went and did it now ! Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord .
AIBILEEN: Everbody know you honest , Minny .
MINNY: Oh , but I got her backI did something awful , Aibileen .
AIBILEEN: What you did ? !
MINNY: She got what she deserve , Aibileen . But , now I ai n't gone never get no work againLeroy gone kill me .
AIBILEEN: Minny !
SKEETER: I parked way up on State Street and caught a cab here like you asked .
AIBILEEN: Got dropped two streets over ? Skeeter nods .
SKEETER: Aibileen , I now know it 's against the law for us to meet like this .
AIBILEEN: Thank you .
SKEETER: I 've never been in a colored person 's home before . I think we 're both doing great . This tea is really nice .
AIBILEEN: Miss Skeeter , What ifWhat if you do n't like what I got to say ? About white peoples ?
SKEETER: Ithis is n't about my opinion . It does n't matter how I feel .
AIBILEEN: You gone have to change my name . Mine , Miss Leefolt 's , everbody 's .

AIBILEEN: I 'm sorry , I-
SKEETER: No , I am . She pulls out a stack of Miss Myrna letters .
AIBILEEN: I thought I might write my stories down and read them to you .
SKEETER: Well , sure I guess .
AIBILEEN: It no different than writing down my prayers .
SKEETER: You do n't say your prayers aloud ?
AIBILEEN: Prayer like electricity . It keep life going . Writing it down make it more powerful . Lot a ailing , sick peoples in this town .
SKEETER: I 'm sure .
AIBILEEN: I did n't get a chance to pray fo Treelore .

SKEETER: What ?
STUART: Things are fine around here . Why stir up trouble ?
SKEETER: I 'm not stirring up trouble , Stuart . Trouble 's already here .
STUART: I guess it is . Skeeter grabs his arm .
SKEETER: I had to tell you . You needed to know . Stuart shakes his head and pulls away
STUART: I guess I do n't really know you , Skeeter . And I ca n't marry somebody I do n't know . Stuart looks down at the ring .

JOHNNY: Next morning , I snuck back up to the house , peeked in the window , and there you were . Given ol ' Oscar a wipe down . Minny smiles for the first time .
MINNY: So I ai n't losing my job ?
JOHNNY: You have a job with us for the rest of your life , if you want it .

MINNY: You ai n't got nothing left here but enemies in the Junior League . You done burned ever bridge there is . And you ai n't never gone get another man in this town , and eve ody know it . So do n't walk you white butt to New York , RUN IT !

AIBILEEN: I ai n't stole no silver . Elizabeth whispers to Hilly .
ELIZABETH: She says she does n't have them .
HILLY: Then it behooves me to inform you that you are fired , Aibileen . And I 'll be calling the police . They know me . Mae Mobley enters the room .
MAE MOBLEY: Aibee , my froat hurts . Mae Mobley coughs .
AIBILEEN: I go get her some syrup , Miss Leefolt .
HILLY: Elizabeth can take care of he child .
ELIZABETH: I 'll go get the couch syrup .
HILLY: I wo n't tolerate liars !
AIBILEEN: I did n't steal no silver .
HILLY: I 'm not talking about silver . I 'm talking about those things you wrote about Elizabeth . Maybe I ca n't send you to jail for what you wrote , but I can send you to jail for being a thief . And you friend , Minny ? That nigra 's got a nice surprise coming to her . Johnny Foote listens to what I say . She 's as good as- Aibileen shouts , interrupting Hilly .
AIBILEEN: Woman ! I know something about you . Do n't you forget that . Hilly narrows her eyes .
HILLY: Nobody would believe something you wrote .
AIBILEEN: I do n't know . Already sold a lot a ooks . Fear floods into Hilly 's eyes .
HILLY: Get out of here !
MAE MOBLEY: Do n't go , Aibiee !
AIBILEEN: Baby , you need to get back to bed . You got a fever .
MAE MOBLEY: Noooo ! Do n't go , Aibee . Please do n't leave .
AIBILEEN: I gots to , Baby . I am so sorry .
MAE MOBLEY: Why ? Are you going to take care of another little girl ?
AIBILEEN: No , Baby , that 's not the reason . I do n't want to leave you , butIt 's time for me to retire . You my last little girl .

WARREN: You want some ?
FAY: Where the hell have you been ? Mom , come on and eat .
MARY: I 'm not hungry .
FAY: Then why 'd I cook !
MARY: I do n't know why you cooked ! I do n't know why you bother !
FAY: Sit down and eat , Simon .
HENRY: Get up off your knees .
AMY: Say something .
WARREN: She 's mute .
AMY: What ?
WARREN: She do n't you know talk .
AMY: Kiss my ass . Simon is nonplussed .
WARREN: Oh , shit !
MR DENG: Stay the hell out of my store , you good-for-nothing punks !
HENRY: Centuries ago it had an ' e ' at the end . Simon looks over and sees
SIMON: Where do you come from ?
HENRY: Nowhere in particular .
SIMON: Why are you in trouble ?
HENRY: An honest man is always in trouble , Simon . Remember that .
SIMON: How do you know my name ?
HENRY: Well I 'll take your word for that .
SIMON: People . I mean . They think . You know . Because .
HENRY: I see .
SIMON: What are these ?
HENRY: This ? This is my life 's work . My memoirs . My 'Confession ' .
SIMON: What have you done ?
HENRY: I 've been bad . Repeatedly . But why brag ? The details of my exploits are only a pretext for a far more expansive consideration of general truths . What is this ? It 's a philosophy . A poetics . A politics , if you will . A literature of protest . A novel of ideas . A pornographic magazine of truly comic-book proportions . It is , in the end , whatever the hell I want it to be . And when I 'm through with it , it 's gunna blow a hole this wide straight through the world 's own idea of itself !
SIMON: No !
HENRY: Once . I forget where I was . Central America maybe . Somewhere hot . Stupid job . Bad pay . Dangerous location and water so foul the natives would n't even piss in it . This crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel oom and threatens to tear me lim from limb . And I say , listen , hombres , OK , you 've got me outnumbered fou to one and you 're gunna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is ever gunna notice I 'm gone . Fine . But one of you one of you one of you is gunna have his eye torn out . Period . Silence . I epeat myself . One of you poor , underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ipped out of its socket . I promise . It 's a small thing , perhaps , all things considered . But I will succeed . Because it 's the only thing I have left to do in this world . So why do n't you just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for a few minutes more . They sober up a little , look at thei shoes in confusion , then step out into the hall to talk among themselves .
SIMON: What happened ?
HENRY: Well , here I am , still , after all .
MARY: Did you throw up all over some girl ?
SIMON: Did you take your pills ?
MARY: What 's the use ? She might as well get it while she can . She 's not always gunna have the ass she has now , you know . That 's just how life is .
HENRY: Good morning , Simon ! Glorious day , huh ? Here , have a donut . Can you lend me twenty dollars ?
SIMON: Down the highway about a mile and a half and then make a left .
HENRY: Excellent ! I 'm polishing up the final chapters of my 'Confession ' and I need a reasonably well-stocked eference section . He lifts up Simon 's notebook .
SIMON: I thought . Um . I was . I wanted to . Maybe .
HENRY: Can I take this ?
SIMON: One of you is gunna lose an eye .
WARREN: Fuck .
AMY: Take me home .
HENRY: Simon ! Who did this to you ?
SIMON: I was gunna tear out their eyes . I knew I could do it .
HENRY: Whose eyes ?
SIMON: I told them . Like you said . I told them . And I knew I could do it . He passes out . Henry looks at Mr Deng .
MR DENG: You should take him home . He smells like a toilet .
FAY: Shit , Mom , we got ta get him to a hospital !
SIMON: No !
FAY: Oh , shut up ! Turn around .
MARY: This kinda thing has happened before .
HENRY: It wo n't happen again .
MARY: How do you know ?
HENRY: This your husband ?
MARY: Stop that .
MR DENG: Mr Fool , what is this ?
HENRY: It 's poetry .
MR DENG: Are you sure ?
HENRY: Of course I 'm sure . I corrected the spelling myself .
MR DENG: It made my daughter sing .
HENRY: Yeah , well , you know that 's what poetry does .
MR DENG: But she has never spoken in her life . Meanwhile , back in the bathroom
SIMON: Owww ! ! !
FAY: Keep still !
SIMON: Let me do it !
FAY: Fine ! You do it , Simon ! I do n't care !
MARY: Fay , just take him to the hospital , will ya !
FAY: But he wo n't go !
MARY: Simon Grim , you go to the hospital with Fay right now , do hear me !
HENRY: We got ta talk .
SIMON: Nothing .
HENRY: Well , you know you wrote it in a kind of iambic pentameter .
SIMON: Iambic what ?
HENRY: Verse . He scratches his chin and smokes .
SIMON: It hurts to breathe .
HENRY: Of course it does . Simon coughs and Henry leans back and smokes .
SIMON: Like this ?
HENRY: Yeah . No . OK ?
SIMON: Wait !
HENRY: Do n't move ! Fuck . There .
SIMON: Are you sure that 's right ?
HENRY: Yes . Now shut up and lie back . Simon does .
SIMON: Is this gunna hurt ?
HENRY: Yes . He pauses , then leans back .
SIMON: What 's that ?
HENRY: It 's blood . From your head . Lie back . Shove that in your mouth and hold on to something .
SIMON: Aaagghhh ! ! ! ! ! ! !
FAY: So , do you have , like , you know , a girlfriend , Henry ?
HENRY: No .
FAY: Do you find me attractive ?
HENRY: Yes , I do .
FAY: I look young for my age , do n't I ?
HENRY: How old are you ?
FAY: How old do you think I am ?
HENRY: You look young .
FAY: How young ?
HENRY: I do n't know . Young .
FAY: But how I mean , do I look more like twenty , or you know , thirty ?
HENRY: Thirty . Fay jumps up , furious .
FAY: Listen , you geek , after a couple of drinks plenty of people mistake me for eighteen !
VICKY: Hey , Warren , are you a registered voter ?
WARREN: Bug off , Vicky ! Unruffled , she hands him a flyer .
VICKY: It 's everything you need to know about the upcoming elections and congressman Owen Feer and all the eally good things he wants to do for our country . He tokes deeply , then
WARREN: Oh yeah , like what ?
VICKY: He wants to win back this country for us Americans , Warren , and restore some kind of cultural-moral standard to our way of life .
WARREN: What time 's your kid go off to school ?
VICKY: Nine o'clock .
WARREN: How about I come over and visit you later ?
VICKY: Well , I do n't know , Warren . I mean Warren gets up , too .
WARREN: Come on . I mean it . I 'm trying to change .
VICKY: How dare you put something like this up where anyone can see it !
MR DENG: It 's poetry .
VICKY: It 's pornography ! The product of a diseased mind ! You oughta be ashamed of yourself , Mr Deng !
MR DENG: It made Gnoc sing .
VICKY: It 's disgusting ! There oughta be a law or something !
HENRY: There 's no accounting for taste , is there , Mr Deng ?
SIMON: Uh-huh .
HENRY: And look , if you 're gunna read Wordsworth you 've got ta get a more up-to-date edition . This odoriferous tome you 're so attached to does n't even have all fourteen books of the Prelude . And you need notes . Commentary . I 'll go to the library and find you the best edition they have .
SIMON: Thank you , but that 's OK . I 'll stop there on my way back from work . Well , yes , maybe not today , but , you know , tomorrow , probably .
HENRY: Quit .
SIMON: My job ?
HENRY: Yeah .
SIMON: Why ?
HENRY: You need time to write , Simon . To study . To reflect .
SIMON: But I like my job .
HENRY: We all have to make sacrifices . A vocation like ours , Simon , is not a nine to five thing . You ca n't put a fence around a man 's soul . We think and feel where and when we can think and feel . We are the servants of ou muse and we toil where she commands .
SIMON: She 's clinically depressed .
HENRY: Yeah , and what 's that mean ?
SIMON: I guess it means it 's not her fault .
HENRY: You ever think of leaving ?
SIMON: Here ?
HENRY: Yeah .
SIMON: To go where ?
HENRY: Out there . You know , into the world . Where ever .
SIMON: Yeah , I guess .
HENRY: 'Opportunity will step away and make oom for a man to pass it by . '
SIMON: Is that from your book ?
HENRY: No . I found it in a fortune cookie .
SIMON: Can I read your confession ?
HENRY: No . Not yet . Soon . We 'll see .
SIMON: Is it almost finished ?
HENRY: Well , you know , Simon , a piece of work like this , it 's A vocation like ours You ca n't put a fence around a man 's soul . What I 'm trying to achieve , it 's Well , it takes a lifetime really . It 's a life 's work . But soon . Do n't worry . I 'd appreciate your feedback . I got ta go . See ya .
MARY: What are you doing there , Simon ?
SIMON: I 'm writing a poem .
PAT: So what ? It ai n't so great .
CHRIS: That him ?
AMY: Pardon me , Simon .
PAT: One of the editors .
AMY: One of the editors , and we
PAT: You .
AMY: I wanted to know if we could print your poem in this month 's issue . Simon looks around at them all , threatened .
SIMON: Why ?
AMY: Because I think it 's great .
PAT: I do n't .
CHRIS: Who cares what you think ?
TED: You 're a drag .
CHRIS: A well-known drag .
AMY: Please ?
FAY: Ma , you take your medication ?
HENRY: Evening , Fay .
FAY: What do you want ?
HENRY: I 've got these books for Simon . She turns away .
FAY: Well , leave 'em there on the counter , then .
WARREN: Hey , Simon , you a registered voter ?
FAY: Where is he ?
MARY: You bastard !
HENRY: What ?
MARY: Get out !
HENRY: Listen . I know a man . He 's a big shot in the publishing business . Angus James . Smart , adventurous and tons of integrity . When this thing is ready , I 'll recommend he reads it . He 'll respect my opinion .
SIMON: A man was here today looking fo you .
HENRY: What man ?
SIMON: I do n't know . He drove by the house a few times .
HENRY: Why do they torment me like this ? Why ? They 're like a bunch of fucking mosquitoes !
SIMON: What do they want from you ?
HENRY: They want to suffocate me , Simon ! They wan na extinguish me like a flame !
TIM: But why ?
HENRY: They 're afraid , that 's why ! They 're afraid of what I might do ! What I might say ! Think ! They 're afraid of my ideas !
SIMON: Yeah ?
HENRY: We 're outsiders . We think and feel too much and too deeply . And the world ca n't handle that . Our mere existence is a threat to its illusion of security . Sure , they 'll name a wing of a new library after us when we 're dead ! But now Now , when we 're alive Now , they wan na burn us at the stake !
SIMON: I do n't want to think about this .
HENRY: Bad move , Simon . Simon stops and looks at him .
SIMON: Am I really a poet ?
HENRY: Of course you are ! A great poet ! But you need experience . You need to do something to be ashamed of every once in a while , for cryin ' out loud . He walks to the door .
MARY: That man 's a bad influence .
SIMON: On who ? She gets up and storms into her room .
HENRY: Simon . Hey , Simon . Come on . I got ya some coffee .
SIMON: What 's this ?
HENRY: It 's a computer . You write on it . He reaches into his pocket .
SIMON: Where 'd you get it ?
HENRY: I stole it . Now listen . Remember how yesterday we discussed the relative desirability of cadence in relation to the readability of
FAY: Oh , shit ! Not you again !
HENRY: Simon , I ca n't work under these conditions .
FAY: Yeah ! Get outta here , you freak !
HENRY: Get a life !
FAY: Eat shit and die , Henry ! Mary throws open her bedroom door .
MARY: Beast ! Fiend ! Rapist !
FAY: Oh , shut up , Mom !
SIMON: Henry , wait up !
HENRY: I am not a rapist ! But Henry stops short , seeing Officer Buñuel enter World of Donuts .
SIMON: Henry , what 's going on ? Who is that guy ? What 's he want ?
HENRY: He wants to help me ! He wants to be my friend .
SIMON: Help you with what ?
HENRY: Shhh !
FATHER HAWKES: I doubt .
HENRY: So , you 're an honest man . Why beat yourself up about it ?
FATHER HAWKES: I do n't know if there are grounds for faith . Is my vocation relevant ? Does it make a difference ?
SIMON: A difference in what ?
FATHER HAWKES: The world . The way it is . Is this a way to help relieve suffering ?
HENRY: Your vocation makes a difference .
FATHER HAWKES: How can you be so sure ?
HENRY: Because vocation is the difference . Only someone who really cares doubts . Listen , father , as I was about to tell my friend Simon here , I am , without doubt , the biggest sinne within a hundred miles of this parish . But still , I 've got ta stay up late at night to outdo the unending parade of mundane little atrocities I see committed every day right out in the open spaces of this loud and sunlit culture we call home .
FATHER HAWKES: You seem to me to be a sensitive and generous man .
HENRY: I like to think so . But the fact is I appreciate depravity . Nevertheless , I insist your vocation makes a difference , because to hold out anything other than a spiritual yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss . Listen , have you got any money ? Let 's go have a drink .
WARREN: Excuse me , miss , are you a registered voter ?
MISS: Oh God , really I do n't know .
WARREN: Well , I 'd like to give you some information about Congressman Owen Feer . This man is gunna make a big difference in the lives of every American in the years to come
MISS: Thanks , sure . I got ta go , thanks . A man , Bill , steps up
WARREN: Pardon me , sir
BILL: Fuck off !
WARREN: Right .
FAY: Do n't you dare talk that way to me ! And keep your hands off my brother . Pearl , what are you doing here ?
WARREN: I 'm watchin ' her . Fay figures it out and approaches .
FAY: You and Vicky get back together ?
WARREN: I got ta regular job now and everything . She lifts a flyer and reads .
FAY: I saw this retard on TV this morning .
WARREN: He 's gunna be the next president of the United States of America , Fay .
FAY: Keep dreamin ' Warren . The guy 's a Nazi .
WARREN: I like him !
FAY: Gim me a light .
WARREN: He 's a decent man . He takes complicated issues and totally simplifies them . And I appreciate that .
FAY: You still sell dope ?
WARREN: No . You know what the problem is with this country , Fay ? Me . I 'm the problem . We live in a culture of poverty and crime , where the work ethic is undermined and male esponsibility is made irrelevant .
FAY: Come on , Pearl , let 's go play at my house .
WARREN: She gives you any trouble , Fay , you just let me know .
FATHER HAWKES: Do you think human beings are innately ad ?
HENRY: Worse than bad ! Monstrous ! But I love that about them . Wake up , Simon ! Simon falls off his bar stool .
WARREN: Jesus Christ , Simon , you 're letting yourself go to hell ! You read that flyer I gave you ?
SIMON: What ?
WARREN: Simon , wake up and smell the coffee , huh ! It 's up to guys like you and me to help create a better tomorrow ! Simon is lost .
VICKY: I 'm not saying you did , I 'm just saying one was and since you do have this criminal background Whack ! ! ! He slaps her
WARREN: Do n't judge me !
BUÑUEL: Look , I know you know him . People have seen you around together .
SIMON: What did he do ?
BUÑUEL: I 'm not supposed to talk about that stuff with people .
SIMON: He 's my . Friend .
BUÑUEL: Mr Deng says you 're some sort of a poet , or something .
WARREN: Vicky , look I 'm sorry .
VICKY: Do n't you even come near me !
FAY: What do you mean , you quit ?
SIMON: I quit my job .
FAY: Why !
SIMON: There are things I want to do .
FAY: Like what ?
SIMON: 'Opportunity will step out of the way to let a man pass it by . '
FAY: Are you drunk ?
SIMON: Now you have to go out and get a job !
FAY: I am not gettin ' a job ! Who 's gunna look after Mom !
SIMON: I will . Fay looks at the ceiling and sighs .
FAY: Pearl , go outside . They wait as the child goes outside . Mary listens , unseen , from her bedroom door .
SIMON: If you treat Mom like a sick person , she 's gunna stay like you know , a sick person .
FAY: Simon , do n't be retarded
SIMON: I am not retarded !
FAY: Mom ca n't be left alone with no one to keep an eye on her . Simon is frustrated and lashes out .
SIMON: Well , who 's been keeping an eye on her while you 've been out getting fucked by every OTB winner in town ?
FAY: What happened to her , Simon ? How did she get this way ? Will it happen to me too ? Huh ? Why are we so fucked up ?
SIMON: Henry ?
HENRY: Simon ! What are you doing here ?
SIMON: Henry Your parole officer , Office Buñuel , came by again today . Henry sighs and sits back down .
HENRY: Simon
SIMON: He gave me this number
HENRY: Simon
SIMON: He was talking to Mr Deng too , and , well , you know , I was thinking
HENRY: Simon , just shut the fuck up !
SIMON: Call him , Henry . Please .
HENRY: OK. Look , do me a favor . You got a library card ?
SIMON: Yeah .
HENRY: Check this out for me . Simon looks at the cover Paradise Lost .
SIMON: I make girls uncomfortable .
HENRY: Bullshit ! You 've got a rough hewn charm that sets 'em on edge . Now , listen , I got ta go .
SIMON: Henry ? Henry stops and turns . Simon pauses , then
HENRY: I got caught .
SIMON: 'Whereto with speedy words the arch- fiend replied Fallen Cherub , to be weak is miserable '
BUÑUEL: How are you , Henry ?
HENRY: Peachy . Gim me a light .
BUÑUEL: Have you found a job ? Henry just glares at him and smokes .
HENRY: What happened to this assistant librarian position you were supposed to set me up with ? Buñuel looks down , disappointed .
BUÑUEL: I tried , Henry . I really did .
HENRY: So what happened ?
BUÑUEL: Henry , with your background Well , I mean , with your record , they did n't think it 'd be right to have you at the neighborhood library .
HENRY: Why not ?
BUÑUEL: They thought you 'd be a bad influence on the kids . Henry sits back , offended .
HENRY: So my word is not enough . My promise worthless . The fact I 've served my time nothing but the emblem of my continuing guilt .
BUÑUEL: Apparently .
FAY: What 's up ?
SIMON: Nothing .
FAY: I 'm creating my résumé . This computer 's got a program especially for it . I bought some special stationery too . It 's scented . Look .
SIMON: Can you type my poem into that thing ?
FAY: That 's your poem ?
SIMON: Yeah .
FAY: Simon , Mom 's right about you . A poem 's supposed to be a small , delicate kinda thing . Kinda feminine . Gentle . Look at this . You 've made a fuckin ' telephone book .
HENRY: I was caught . Yes , I was caught once . I was caught in flagranti delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old girl named Susan . She was an ugly and mean-spirited kid , but she knew how to play upon my weaknesses which , I admit , are deep and many . He drinks , then looks at Simon and adds
SIMON: Sorry . Henry stands and leans over the fire .
HENRY: It was a pathetic little conspiracy . A transparently desperate attempt to discredit me and my ideas ; to label me a mere pedophile . As if I 'd be ashamed of such a thing . As if Socrates himself had n't been taken out of circulation for corrupting the youth of Athens !
SIMON: When can I read it ?
HENRY: Soon .
FATHER HAWKES: We are told not to judge . But to forgive . Not to look into ou neighbor 's eye to find the bad , but to find the good . Now this is difficult . I admit . But having a good friend is not always easy .
SIMON: Yes , but do you think Henry is dangerous ?
FATHER HAWKES: He needs help . Our help . Yours especially .
SIMON: But what can I do ?
FATHER HAWKES: The best parts of himself come to the surface when he 's helping someone learn . I 've seen this . Let yourself e taught . Show your appreciation for his guidance . In this way , you know , perhaps . Well . There 's hope for everyone . Even . Even Henry .
FAY: Gnoc , gim me a value pack of Kleenex , will ya ?
TIM: The violence of the imagery reminds me of early Clash , while the lyricism of the verse recalls , for me , Walt Whitman .
BIBI: I would have said Dickinson , maybe even Eliot , and so on . But I agree with the punk roots
HENRY: The greats all say the same thing little . And what little there is to e said is immense . Or , in othe words , follow your own genius to where it leads without regard fo the apparent needs of the world at large , which , in fact , has no needs as such , but , rather , moments of exhaustion in which it is incapable of prejudice . We can only hope to collide with these moments of unselfconsciousness . This divine fatigue this
FAY: Push over .
HENRY: As I tried to make plain in Paris 'Nous savons que nous avons chuté parce que nous savons qui nous sommes . ' 'We know we have fallen ecause we know who we are . '
FAY: When were you in Paris ?
HENRY: That 's beside the point . But did they listen to me ? Of course not ! Fay blows her nose and Simon is concerned .
SIMON: You alright , Fay ?
FAY: No , I 'm not alright ! Your poem brought my period on a week and half early ! So just shut up . Everybody just shut up !
HENRY: For is this not the best of all possible worlds ? Are not the evils of this world necessary components of a cosmos that could not exist without them ?
CHRIS: So , do you believe in God ?
HENRY: Unfortunately .
FAY: Yeah , but when were you in Paris ?
HENRY: At . One . Time .
CHRIS: Simon , can I have your autograph ?
HENRY: Go ahead . But never let yourself be flattered . Simon signs the girl 's book .
FAY: So what about this friend of yours , Hot Shot ? The publisher .
HENRY: Who ?
SIMON: Angus James .
FAY: Yeah . Angus James . How about sending this poem to him ? Henry seems a bit put upon .
HENRY: Because it 's not done yet .
FAY: When 's it gunna be done , Simon ?
SIMON: I do n't know .
FAY: Well , you oughta be home writing instead of hanging out over here with all your groupies .
AMY: Hey , I 'm not a groupie .
FAY: Pardon me , swivel-hips . Is that you PowerBook ?
AMY: Yeah .
FAY: Can I see it ? Fay and Amy talk tech as
HENRY: The thing to do is to send parts of it to different magazines and literary journals first . That kinda thing . You know . Substantiate it .
AMY: What 's 'scatalogical ' mean ? Henry sips his beer and looks at her .
HENRY: Filth , child . A preoccupation with excrement . Why ?
AMY: That 's what the Board of Education called Simon 's poem , yesterday ; scatological .
EDNA: Hello ?
FAY: Yeah , I 'm listening .
EDNA: My name is Edna Rodriguez and I write the human interest column for the Queens County Examiner and I was just wondering if I could have a word with Simon Grim ?
FAY: Simon !
EDNA: Thank you .
FAY: You ca n't talk to him for , you know , too long or anything , 'cause he 's got ta , you know he writes all day . That 's all he does . Can you elieve that ? No response .
EDNA: Simon , the Parents ' Association at the local high school are calling your poem pornography . The teachers are defending the students ' right to exercise their critical tastes and sensibilities . The county agrees with the Church and considers the poem emblematic of modern society 's moral disintegration . How do you feel about these controversial eactions to your poem ? Simon says nothing . He just stares at her .
FAY: Simon , answer the woman .
MARY: I need my prescription filled .
FAY: Mom , this is Edna . Edna , Mom .
EDNA: Mrs Grim , what was Simon like as a child ?
MARY: We all thought he was retarded .
FAY: Everyone did .
MARY: Never said a word .
FAY: He masturbated constantly .
MARY: Had no friends .
FAY: Till he met Henry .
MARY: And that 's when all the trouble really started .
SIMON: Dear Mr Grim , we here at the magazine consider ourselves and the publication open-minded and cutting edge and have consistently printed the work of the most brilliant and farseeing young talent of the day . Every week we are forced to return writing which we can not for one reason or anothe publish and include a brief but polite efusal . But this tract you 've sent us demands a response as violent as the effect your words have had upon us . Drop dead . Keep your day job . Sincerely , The Editors .
HENRY: De gustibus non disputandum est .
SIMON: You ca n't argue with taste ?
HENRY: About taste . You ca n't argue about taste . God , Simon .
SIMON: The other twenty-five are almost as ad . I do n't know why I bother .
HENRY: What do you mean you do n't know why you bother ? You bother because you know the poem is excellent !
SIMON: Do I ?
HENRY: Of course you do !
SIMON: I 'm not so sure sometimes .
HENRY: Can you sit there , look me straight in the eye , and tell me you do n't think this poem is great ? That it is not at once a work of great lyrical eauty and ethical depth ? That it is not a genuine , highly individual , and profound meditation on the miracle of existence ? Simon holds the stare , overwhelmed .
SIMON: I , ah
HENRY: Can you ?
SIMON: No . I ca n't .
HENRY: So , you see , you have no choice !
SIMON: Can you recommend it to your friend , the publisher ? No response .
HENRY: That might not be as easy as it seems .
SIMON: Why ?
HENRY: Well , it 's been a long time . My name might not carry as much weight as it once did with Angus .
SIMON: But he 's your friend , right ?
HENRY: We were close at one time .
SIMON: You said he respected your opinion .
HENRY: Look , Simon , opinions come and go . He sees Simon looks worried .
SIMON: Henry , why ca n't I read the 'Confession ' ?
HENRY: Because certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order fo one to appreciate the full force of its character .
FAY: Simon , wake up ! The guy 's in a dream world !
SIMON: He 's afraid that his reputation will prevent people from giving my work an honest chance .
FAY: His reputation as what ?
SIMON: As a writer .
FAY: Gim me a break .
SIMON: He 's kinda like in exile . Marginalized on account of his ideas .
FAY: If he 's such a great big fat genius , why does n't he write books ? Like you do .
SIMON: He has . He 's written a book . It 's almost completed . He 's been working on it for years . It 's just not published .
FAY: Yeah , I bet . It 's probably disgusting .
SIMON: It 's a quite serious and difficult piece of work , apparently .
FAY: Have you read it ?
SIMON: No . Not yet . Soon . Certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its character .
FAY: Yeah , well , what ever . Listen , Simon , forget Henry . Go straight up to this Angus James character yourself and make him read your poem .
SIMON: Please do n't stop .
MARY: Yes , it was nice . But it was unremarkable . Simon waits . Eventually
SIMON: Does that matter ?
MARY: Yes . It does .
LAURA: Hi , I 'll take that . Simon steps back defensively .
SIMON: No .
LAURA: Are you here to fix the plumbing ?
SIMON: I 'm here to see Mr. Angus James .
LAURA: Are you ?
SIMON: I 'm not a plumber . Or a messenger . I was once a garbage man . But now I 'm a poet .
BARRY: The book , as we know it , Angus , will e a thing of the past within the next few years . Novels , articles , newspapers will all be downloaded on to our personal computers anyway .
ANGUS: So you 're telling me to get out of the publishing business ?
STEVE: No . But we 've got to re-invent the publishing business for the electronic age . Laura knocks .
ANGUS: Yes , Laura ?
LAURA: I 'm sorry to disturb you , gentlemen , ut Angus , there 's a particularly wound-up young garbage man out here who seems to have written a poem . A long poem . And I recall how , at last month 's meeting , you stressed the need for us to be on the look-out for more marginalized verse from unestablished quarters of the American scene .
ANGUS: Did I say that ? Steve and Barry nod .
STEVE: Yeah . You did .
BARRY: Twice .
ANGUS: Well , OK. Make an appointment , Laura . Sometime next month .
LAURA: Right-e-o . And she 's gone .
ANGUS: So , anyway , how is the digital evolution going to help me sell ooks ?
SIMON: Why ca n't I see him now ?
LAURA: Because he 's a very important man and , well , you 're not .
SIMON: Why ?
ANGUS: I do n't think people are going to prefer reading books on television , Steve .
STEVE: It wo n't be television !
BARRY: It 'll be interactive .
STEVE: Angus , look , we have a number of charts here
BARRY: In every home in America the PC will e where the TV used to be .
STEVE: And it 'll be a direct connection to all forms of media .
BARRY: An unprecedented transformation of American social life
STEVE: We 'll all become better informed , more literate , increasingly productive , and Well , and , like I said , we have a number of charts Laura re-enters
LAURA: Sorry to disturb you again , gentlemen , ut Angus , I 'd like to call security for this one . Though , before I do , I just wanted to ask just how marginal the as yet undiscovered voice of American poetry should be ?
ANGUS: Pretty damn marginal , I 'd think .
BARRY: Down right controversial , probably .
ANGUS: How 's he strike you ?
LAURA: He 's been denounced by his local Board of Education .
BARRY: Oh , I read about him in the paper . Hangs out in a delicatessen somewhere and writes pornography .
ANGUS: Hello , and why do you think I should take valuable time out of my busy schedule to read He grabs the envelope and sees no title .
SIMON: Because it 's a masterpiece .
ANGUS: Really ?
SIMON: Yes .
ANGUS: Are you hearing this ?
LAURA: He 's adorable .
SIMON: I would n't want to waste your time .
ANGUS: I 'm sure you would n't and I appreciate you being so straightforward .
SIMON: Thank you .
ANGUS: I assume you can take straightforward criticism ? Simon looks over at Laura .
LAURA: Just say 'Yes ' .
SIMON: Maybe .
ANGUS: Get him a coffee , Laura .
LAURA: Have a seat , Mr Grim .
ANGUS: Hold my calls for the next half hour .
LAURA: What about Steve ?
ANGUS: He does n't drink coffee . Steve , do you drink coffee ?
STEVE: Angus , listen to me !
HENRY: In the infinite amplitude of his love , God wants to create the largest number of best elements that can exist together in one cosmos OK .
AMY: How do you spell that ?
HENRY: What ?
AMY: Ontologically .
HENRY: O-N-T Do n't you have some kinda spell-check on that thing ?
AMY: Never mind .
HENRY: It is impossible for every perfect good to be compatible with every other perfect good . The intense beauty of the mountain must be set off by the fertility of the plain , so to speak .
AMY: You feel the same way . I can tell . I can see it when you look at me .
HENRY: Hey ! I do n't look at you .
AMY: Yes you do . In the street . In the parking lot yesterday . That night on the highway .
HENRY: I look at a lot of people that way . Disappointed , Amy turns away and sulks .
AMY: You think I 'm stupid .
HENRY: No , as a matter of fact , I think you 're a real bright kid and I like that about you .
AMY: You do ?
HENRY: I like it so much I 've got half a mind to do perverse things to you . Right here . Right now . Things you might just learn to like .
ANGUS: This is really quite unbelievably ad , my friend . I mean , I 'm all fo experimentation and I 've made a caree out of a healthy disregard fo convention , but Look , this is profoundly irrelevant material . This is only my opinion . But it 's an opinion I value highly . Goodnight , Laura . Call Norton Press . We 're still on for tomorrow .
SIMON: A friend of mine spoke of you . He said you had a lot of integrity .
ANGUS: Yes , well , of course , I do . But I 'm not crazy , am I ? Who is this person ? Do I know him ?
SIMON: Henry Fool . Angus looks back at him . Simon waits .
ANGUS: Never heard of him . Simon just looks at him blankly , confused .
LAURA: I remember Henry .
MR DENG: Henry , put those magazines back .
HENRY: I 'm just looking at the pictures .
MR DENG: It 's not good for you .
HENRY: I learn so much from these magazines , Mr Deng . I refuse to discriminate etween modes of knowing .
MR DENG: And you ca n't smoke in here anymore . Henry looks up , outraged .
HENRY: Why not !
MR DENG: It 's the law .
HENRY: This place is losing all its charm , Mr Deng .
MR DENG: Business is good . The kids , they hang out all day and drink coffee , talk about art and read poetry .
HENRY: It 's just a fad , Mr Deng . These kids today , they 're just slaves to fashion .
FAY: Anybody home ? Mom ?
HENRY: Come on , Mr Deng ! How much do I owe you ?
MR DENG: Twenty-five dollars .
HENRY: That ca n't be right ! And so what ? My credit 's good . Warren comes in .
WARREN: Henry !
HENRY: Hey , Warren , you got ta couple of ucks I can borrow ? Warren reaches for his wallet .
WARREN: Listen , Henry , I wan na remind you to vote this Thursday .
HENRY: Ah , yes , of course . When noble minds shrink from the task of leadership scoundrels will rush in to fill the void . Thanks .
WARREN: It 's every American 's right . A lessing . Yet another opportunity to save America from itself . Henry pays Mr Deng for his beer .
FAY: Hey , Henry , you in there ? Gim me a cigarette .
AMY: Henry ? Henry smokes .
HENRY: Yeah .
AMY: What kind of Well , I mean What kind of perverse things would you do to me ?
HENRY: Take a powder , cupcake .
AMY: No , really .
HENRY: Evaporate ! Crushed , she breaks out in tears and flees .
FATHER HAWKES: Let us pray . Lord , grant that peace e within reach for our friend , Mary . May the pain and confusion she endured on earth be fought through in the after life , so that she may ente the Kingdom of Heaven and live in the light of God . Amen .
HENRY: So I was a janitor ! So what ?
SIMON: But Angus James said he did n't even know you ! Henry shrugs and qualifies
HENRY: Well , I mean , we were n't like bosom uddies or anything . But we used to talk sometimes . In the elevator . In the morning . He said he liked my ideas . Being a janitor 's a good jo if you 're a writer . Especially the night shift ; all that time to think and develop my ideas .
SIMON: Do it .
HENRY: Well , what the hell does he know ? He would n't know a vital piece of literary art if it came up and bit him in the leg . To hell with him ! He 's not the only publisher in the world !
SIMON: But nobody likes it .
HENRY: It 's true . A prophet is seldom heeded in his own land . Remember that .
SIMON: Do it .
HENRY: Hey , look , treasure !
SIMON: Brass maybe . Some kinda copper .
HENRY: It 's a ring . Jewelry .
SIMON: I think it 's a gasket . A fitting from off of that old refrigerato over there .
HENRY: Hey , Warren , I found Pearl wandering around by the garbage dump .
WARREN: He lost .
HENRY: Who lost ?
WARREN: Congressman Feer .
HENRY: Oh . Well , you know . Somebody 's got ta lose .
WARREN: What 's the fucking use . You make sacrifices . You try to be a decent human being . Try to contribute something meaningful to society . And what happens ? They lose to a bunch of cultural elite liberal fuck-ups . I do n't give a shit anymore . People deserve what they get .
HENRY: Vicky ?
VICKY: He 's a good man , Henry . Nobody 's perfect .
HENRY: I guess not .
VICKY: He 's terribly disappointed .
HENRY: I found Pearl wandering around with no shoes on her feet .
VICKY: Thanks . She gets scared .
HENRY: And you do n't ?
VICKY: I love him .
HENRY: Where 's the beer ?
MR DENG: No more beer . Coffee . Espresso ! Cappuccino ! Café au lait . Carrot juice . Herbal tea .
HENRY: A double espresso and a jelly donut , Gnoc . You mind paying ? My credit 's no good here anymore , apparently .
BUÑUEL: Did you go to the employment agency today , Henry ?
HENRY: No , but it 's OK. Simon 's gunna try to get me a job on the garbage truck .
BUÑUEL: Listen , I 'm a little concerned about your friend .
HENRY: Simon ?
BUÑUEL: Seems he gave an obscene note to a girl in the library .
HENRY: Get outta here ! When ?
BUÑUEL: I 'm not sure .
HENRY: It could n't have been Simon .
BUÑUEL: It almost certainly is . He mentions you . Look
HENRY: 'Her figure makes me violent . I want to somehow break her . But tenderly . How is this possible ? Ask Henry . '
BUÑUEL: We 've had complaints .
HENRY: Where did you get it ?
BUÑUEL: She posted it on the Internet .
HENRY: Oh , the slut !
BUÑUEL: She was trying to warn other girls about a potential rapist .
HENRY: Is all this true about the Internet ? About how you can get pornography on it ?
BUÑUEL: Well , yeah , sure . It 's a big problem . You can send dirty pictures and everything .
HENRY: On the Internet ?
BUÑUEL: Yeah . Henry is impressed .
HENRY: No kiddin ' ? Buñuel gets up to go .
BUÑUEL: See you on Thursday , Henry .
HENRY: Sure . See you . Gnoc , gim me one of these double espressos to go , will ya ? He is having ideas .
FAY: Go away .
HENRY: You got ta get outta the house , Fay . You ca n't blame yourself for not eing here . You did all you could for her . She turns and glares at him .
FAY: Is there something you want ? Henry stops , pauses , looks away . Then
HENRY: You got the Internet on that contraption ?
FAY: Yeah . So what ?
HENRY: Look Fay , about , you know , between us what happened
FAY: I do n't wan na talk about it , Henry !
HENRY: Type a part of Simon 's poem onto the Internet .
FAY: What ?
HENRY: Go ahead .
FAY: No .
HENRY: Why not ?
FAY: Because .
HENRY: Come on , Fay . It 's a great idea .
FAY: I do n't know if he would want us to do that .
HENRY: Sure he would . Just the first ten verses . Fay is tempted .
FAY: I do n't know .
HENRY: He 'll thank you for it later .
FAY: Henry
HENRY: Gim me another one of those tall double espressos , Mr Deng .
MR DENG: You gunna buy that ?
HENRY: I 'm just looking .
MR DENG: Well then put it back .
HENRY: There 's this fascinating story about a famous rock band and how they tied a friend of theirs to a bed in thei hotel room and inserted a live fish into her vagina . Mr Deng shakes his head and frowns .
MR DENG: Henry , you need to do something with your life . Get a job , or something .
HENRY: I mean , it was n't the entire fish , it was just , you know , the nose . The nose of the fish .
MR DENG: No .
HENRY: You ever wonder what it would be like to have sex with an animal , M Deng ?
MR DENG: That coffee is free . Just take it and get out of here .
HENRY: I mean , some dogs are almost as big as people and often more attractive .
SIMON: Did you see him ?
FAY: He came by this afternoon .
SIMON: Did you talk ?
FAY: No .
SIMON: You 've got to tell him , Fay .
FAY: He thinks I 'm a slut .
SIMON: Henry ?
HENRY: Simon , I do n't feel so good .
SIMON: What 's wrong ?
HENRY: I feel all kinda clammy . And damp .
SIMON: How many of these did you have ? Henry tries to remember . He squints .
HENRY: Seven .
SIMON: Henry , we have to talk .
HENRY: Can I use your toilet ?
SIMON: Fay 's taking a shower .
HENRY: How much you think I can get fo this ? He looks at Simon .
SIMON: Henry , Fay 's pregnant . Henry looks at him .
FAY: Jesus , Henry !
FATHER HAWKES: I , Henry , take you , Fay to be my wife .
HENRY: I , Henry , take you , Fay to be my wife .
FATHER HAWKES: And do promise before God and these witnesses
HENRY: And do promise before God and these witnesses
FATHER HAWKES: To be your loving and faithful husband .
HENRY: To be your loving and faithful husband .
FATHER HAWKES: In plenty and in want .
HENRY: In plenty and in want .
FATHER HAWKES: In joy and in sorrow .
HENRY: In joy and in sorrow .
FATHER HAWKES: In sickness and in health .
HENRY: In sickness and in health .
FATHER HAWKES: For as long as we both shall live .
HENRY: For as long as we both shall live .
FATHER HAWKES: Bless , O Lord , this ring , that he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in your peace and continue in your favor until their life 's end . The gasket is placed on Fay 's finger .
HENRY: Oh , shit .
FAY: Simon , do something . Simon walks down the aisle to see to Amy . The guests watch and wait .
AMY: Look .
SIMON: Where did you get this ?
AMY: It 's all over the Internet . Simon looks up the aisle at Fay and Henry . They look away , caught .
FAY: Simon ? Amy hurries along beside him .
AMY: There 's a guy from the radio station over at World of Donuts and a story in the newspaper about some kids urning down a school near Boston !
REPORTER: It all started right here in Queens , Jim , at World of Donuts about one year ago today , when local garbage man , Simon Grim , put pencil to pape and began to compose what many have come to regard as vicious , antisocial and pornographic poetry 112 lines of unrhymed free meter verse which would one day serve to spark the flames of controversy across the nation and indeed the world . Fay leads the neighbors in the dance
OWEN FEER: This is outrageous ! Measures must be taken . Have we debased our culture to such an extent that a garbage man with a head full of sick ideas is legitimately referred to as a poet , and where the filth he spews can be accessed by any child old enough to turn on a computer ? Is this what we have come to ? Not the transmission of our highest ideals , but a cynical , atheistic delirium !
POET LAUREATE: Poetry of this kind , and this poem in particular , is , I think , a worthy form of desperation ; a digression on the extremes of human experience ; of solitude , of community . It is perhaps alarming , even upsetting to some myself included but it must be allowed to exist .
ANCHORMAN: Meanwhile , in Rome today , the Pope issued a message of hope for believers in their fight against what he termed the godless and lost . He did not mention Simon Grim by name , but offered a prayer for the young whom he described as sadly in need of faith and not the illusion of conviction offered by rock music , drugs and contemporary poetry .
FAY: God , Simon , I mean , like , you 're a total fucking rock star .
ANGUS: I 'm willing to negotiate , Simon .
SIMON: I know , it 's just
ANGUS: You 've had other offers .
SIMON: Well , yes . But .
ANGUS: What ?
SIMON: Why have you reconsidered ?
ANGUS: Because I think your writing will be tremendously successful .
SIMON: But you do n't like it ?
ANGUS: It 's growing on me .
SIMON: What made you change your mind ? He points to the fans outside .
ANGUS: Other people 's responses . I do n't live in a vacuum , you know . Two months ago I did n't have the proof of you poem 's appeal . Now I do .
FATHER HAWKES: What were the terms ?
SIMON: A hundred thousand in cash up front .
FATHER HAWKES: Royalties ?
SIMON: A seventy/thirty split .
FATHER HAWKES: Well , that could be better . But it is a hundred thousand dollars up front . Guaranteed money . You could use that .
SIMON: So it 's a good deal ?
FATHER HAWKES: Of course it 's good .
SIMON: So I should take it ?
FATHER HAWKES: No . Try to get him up to a hundred and fifty thousand .
HENRY: I 've let myself down , Simon ! I 've let myself be caught in the bloody maw of banal necessity ! How did I get here ? How did this happen to me ? I 'm going to be somebody 's father ! I need time to think . To write . Time to finish my 'Confession ' ! I ca n't work for a living ! It 's impossible ! I tried once . My genius will be wasted trying to make ends meet ! He collapses extravagantly .
SIMON: Henry , please , let me read the 'Confession ' .
HENRY: No . Not now . It 's not done . I 'm all washed up . I 'm finished !
SIMON: Angus James is convinced my poem is going to make him incredibly wealthy . He 'll read your book and seriously consider publishing it . If I ask him to . I 'm certain .
HENRY: Really ? You really think so ?
SIMON: I 'll insist he publish the 'Confession ' .
HENRY: You 'd do that ? You 'd do that for me ? Simon stares off into the distance .
SIMON: You saved my life .
HENRY: Do you realize what you 're saying ?
SIMON: I owe you everything .
HENRY: OK .
FAY: It 's really that bad ?
SIMON: It 's terrible .
ANGUS: You 've read this ?
SIMON: Yes .
ANGUS: And you want me to consider publishing it ?
SIMON: Yes .
ANGUS: As part of our deal ?
SIMON: Yes .
ANGUS: Simon , this book , it 's It 's really quite bad .
SIMON: That 's what you said about my poem .
ANGUS: I 'm offering you a very real expression of my faith in you writing . Two hundred thousand dollars and a sixty/forty split .
SIMON: But just exactly what is the nature of your faith in my writing ?
ANGUS: Look , Simon , you do n't require my admiration . You require my experience as a publisher . And that experience leads me to believe your poem will make more money than any book of poetry ever published . In history . Virtually make you a household name within two years . You 'll never have to work on a garbage truck again , I assure you . Or do anything else fo that matter . Whereas this 'Confession ' y Henry Fool He is at a loss for words .
SIMON: He taught me everything I know .
ANGUS: No ! He encouraged all that was expressive in you to become manifest . He inspired you to act . He influenced your perception . Simon waits a while , staring at his shoes .
SIMON: How about if my advance is only a hundred thousand ?
ANGUS: It 's not about money , Simon .
SIMON: We could split the royalties seventy/thirty .
ANGUS: I will not publish Henry Fool 's 'Confession ' .
HENRY: Simon ? You 're here . He sits up and Simon sits beside him .
SIMON: What happened ?
HENRY: It 's a boy .
SIMON: And Fay ?
HENRY: She 's alright .
SIMON: Listen , Henry , Angus James did n't like your 'Confession ' .
HENRY: Ah . I see . Well , what now ?
SIMON: What do you mean ?
HENRY: Did he suggest changes ? Silence . Simon comes back and sits again .
SIMON: No . He did n't .
HENRY: I mean , after all , there are things I can do to make it more accessible .
SIMON: Accessible ?
HENRY: I can soften up some of the language and make it read easier . Take out some of the more intratextual eferences and popularize the underlying Sturm und Drang , so to speak . I can change its mode . Make it more of a conventional novel instead .
SIMON: No . Do n't .
HENRY: Oh , Simon , do n't be such a purist ! I appreciate your protectiveness , but the integrity of the work gives it a durability that can sustain such things .
SIMON: No . Really , Henry . Do n't .
HENRY: What are you saying ; that it does n't merit revision ?
SIMON: I 'm saying Angus James did n't like it .
HENRY: Well , did you tell him what you think ?
SIMON: What I think does n't matter .
HENRY: Yes , it does . You 've got to use you influence with him .
SIMON: I gave it to him to read and he hated it . What more can I do ?
HENRY: You can refuse to let him publish your poem .
SIMON: I ca n't do that .
HENRY: You said you would .
SIMON: That was before I read your book .
HENRY: Oh .
SIMON: I signed the contract , Henry .
HENRY: I I do n't know . Honesty , perhaps .
SIMON: Look , if I had told you , when at first I read it , that I thought it was no good , what would you have done ?
HENRY: I would have respected your opinion .
SIMON: And insisted that there 's no accounting for taste .
HENRY: Well , is there ?
SIMON: I do n't know . I did n't bring it to Angus because I thought it was good . I brought it to Angus because you 're my friend .
HENRY: Oh how perfectly enormous of you , Simon .
SIMON: Look , Henry , I did it ! I wrote . I wrote poetry because you told me to ! I worked ! I worked while you sat ack and comfortably dismissed the outside world as too shallow , stupid and mean to appreciate your ideas .
HENRY: Is that such a priority ? Is that some sort of measure of a man 's worth ? To drag what 's best in him out into the street so every average slo with some pretense to taste can poke it with a stick ?
SIMON: Maybe . Maybe it is .
HENRY: You must be pretty impressed with yourself , huh ? The all too obviously talented new man , the important new voice , the early clue to a new direction , or whatever , etc. , etc. , etc ! A popular new trend conveniently packaged for the distracted young herd ! You want to be liked more than you know , Simon Grim ! You 'd be nowhere without me and you know it . Simon hangs his head , destroyed .
SIMON: I 'm leaving .
HENRY: Yes . It 's time you left .
SIMON: The world is full of shit .
HENRY: The world is full of shit . It 's true . And you have to walk through it . That 's your part . I 'm sorry . But you 're no good at it . Perhaps I 'm not . Perhaps I was n't made to walk through shit . Go on now . Leave . Do what you 're good at . Go .
FAY: Play !
PATTY: Henry , what did I tell you about inging the kid in here !
HENRY: Say hello to Patty , Ned .
NED: Hi . She suddenly becomes all soft and cuddly .
PATTY: How you doin ' , sweetie ? You wan na Coke ?
HENRY: So what did you learn at school today , Ned ? Anything ? He shakes his head .
NED: It burns .
HENRY: See . That 'll teach ya . Here , sip this . And he offers the kid his whiskey .
FAY: Ned ! She comes out to the street and looks around .
WARREN: I 'm warning you , Pearl !
HENRY: That 's it . That 's it . Perfect !
BILL: Hey , Fool , it 's about your friend what 's his name . Your brother-in- law .
HENRY: What about him ?
BILL: The controversial and reclusive American poet Simon Grim has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . The Swedish Academy , who will confe the award late next week , praised M Grim for works of great and difficult striving , for the rendering of the desperate , the ugly and the mundane in a language packed with our shared human frailties
HENRY: God , they must be hard up for geniuses to pin medals on because , listen , I got ta tell you , when I first met this guy he did n't even know what an iambic pentameter was .
BILL: He 's a fraud .
HENRY: Keep a lid on it , Bill , you 're outta your league .
BILL: Stir things up so as to stay in the newspapers . That 's his racket .
HENRY: He 's a great American poet , you dum fuck !
BILL: Poet , my ass ! I could puke all ove a piece a loose leaf and be more profound than he is !
HENRY: Come over here and say that and I 'll cripple ya in three different ways , you boozed-up Philistine !
FAY: Henry !
HENRY: His throat hurt from smoking .
FAY: Henry , do n't come home tonight ! I 'm warning you ! Do n't come home at all ! Ever !
HENRY: Who 's winning ?
MR DENG: Nobody . Henry gestures to World of Donuts
HENRY: What 's going on in there ?
MR DENG: We got ta have rock ' n ' roll shows these days , Henry . The poetry readings just do n't pay the bills no more .
HENRY: What did I tell you ! It was just a fad . I told you that ! I told everyone !
MR DENG: Did you hear about Simon ? It was on the news today .
HENRY: Yeah yeah yeah . So what ? A Nobel Prize . Anybody can get one of them these days . That 's the problem , with this world , Mr Deng Nobody 's got any standards anymore . You seen Fay ?
MR DENG: You better sleep in my office tonight , Henry . She was very angry . You 've got ta let her cool off .
HENRY: I ca n't sleep in there with that acket !
MR DENG: Suit yourself . Henry considers his options , then
HENRY: What are you doing here , Pearl ?
PEARL: You want some ?
HENRY: Some what ?
PEARL: Come sit here . She pats the couch beside her .
HENRY: What ?
PEARL: 'You want some ? '
HENRY: That was a long time ago .
PEARL: You want some ?
HENRY: You oughta get outta here , Pearl .
PEARL: I was here first .
HENRY: Go home .
PEARL: You go home .
HENRY: Fine . And he starts to leave . But Pearl sits up
PEARL: Wait ! Henry stops and looks back at her .
HENRY: Why not ?
PEARL: He beat her up again .
HENRY: Warren beat up your mom ?
PEARL: Do you think I 'm pretty ?
HENRY: Does she need help ?
PEARL: I 'll suck your cock if you kill him for me .
HENRY: Vicky ! Vicky , it 's Henry from across the street ! Vicky !
VICKY: What do you think you 're doing , you idiot !

HENRY: I 'm not sure .

THEN: At least we know that 's still there . Henry looks at him .
MAX: Money is a mistress with a hard heart .
MR. TUTTLE: Savings . Interest only . Commercial
MR. TUTTLE: We hope he 's right !
MAX: He was never wrong . How long 's it been there already Mr. Tuttle ?

TO JULIE: Mary wants to fit your wig at four . Darek says to stay hungry .
JULIE: Fuck him .
SIMON: Got it . Max and Henry exchange a glance .
MAX: Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time 's sake ?
JULIE: He used to perform here .
SIMON: I do n't see why not . We 're on a break .
MAX: That okay , Henry ?
HENRY: Sure . Go ahead . Julie and Henry watch them go .
JULIE: Is that your dad ?
HENRY: No . He 's a friend .
JULIE: He seems like your dad .
HENRY: It 's peaceful out here . Beat .
JULIE: What ?
HENRY: Pretending to be other people . She thinks .
JULIE: It 's not really like that . I do n't pretend to be someone else . I find some part of me , and reveal it in a new wayjust inside of a character .
HENRY: So , in a way , you 're still playing ` you ' .
JULIE: Yes . Exactly . In a way .
HENRY: So what part of ` you ' are you playing now ?
JULIE: That 's the question you always have to ask yourself .
MAX: Ah , the inner sanctum . The magic before the magic ! I remember it like it was yesterday .
ARNOLD: People often make the mistake in Chekhov of going downbut you must always always go up Other ACTORS look at him with blank faces .
MAX: Simon , did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days ?
SIMON: Yes . And they hid the booze in the bank !

JULIE: Jail !
HENRY: Sounds worse than it is .
JULIE: Really ? Jail sounds bad .
THEN: Why were you in there ? She takes a big bite of her sandwich .
HENRY: No . Do I look like one ? She studies him .
JULIE: No .
HENRY: What do I look like ? She studies him some more .
JULIE: I do n't know . A criminal . He laughs .

ENTHUSIASTICALLY: It was right here . Max comes up . Feels it now too .
MAX: Booze , broads and lucre . The good old days . I like it .
SIMON: They filled it in , in 1931 when they uilt the theatre .
MAX: All good things must come to an end .
HENRY: The Cherry Orchard . So what happens ? What 's it about ? Is it funny ? Julie gets up out of her chair .
JULIE: A woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved Cherry Orchard , the magical place of he youth , the only place she ever felt safe .
HENRY: I guess it 's not funny . She looks at him .
JULIE: It 's about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive . Max 's voice booms
SIMON: Max has very kindly offered to voluntee at the theatre !
JULIE: Oh .

JULIE: Do n't laugh .
THEN: Hollywood .
HENRY: I guess that 's where people go .
JULIE: I do n't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial . And it 's not going to be . Soon as this thing is done I 'm out of here .

HENRY: Yeah . She laughs .
JULIE: You were watching everyone go somewhere and you were going nowhere .
HENRY: That 's funny ?
JULIE: Yeah . Funny sad , not funny funny .
HENRY: I worked nights . It gave me time to think .
JULIE: About what ?
HENRY: About where I was n't going .
JULIE: See , that 's funny .
THEN: What about now ? Where you going now ?
HENRY: I 'm working on it .
JULIE: What 'd they send you to jail for Henry ?
HENRY: For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank .
JULIE: What !
HENRY: I thought I was on my way to a softball game . It was a mistake . Pause .
JULIE: Sounds like it . He looks at her . Decides
HENRY: But now I 'm going to rob it for real .
JULIE: You 're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing ?
HENRY: Yeah .

HENRY: ` I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train . Such a bother , I wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you .
TO HER: You 're as wonderful as ever . ' He stops , looks at her
JULIE: Read the next line !
HENRY: ` Even more beautiful , and dressed like a Parisianyou could blow me down . '
JULIE: Say it like you feel it . Like it 's real . Say it to me . Henry takes a beat . This time he makes it his .
`HENRY: Even more beautiful , and dressed like a Parisianyou could blow me down . ' She laughs like a little girl .
JULIE: You 're good . Keep reading ! And get up . Walk around !
HENRY: ` Your brother says I 'm an upstart , a money-grubber . '
JULIE: Yes , you are . You 're a bank robber , Henry ! He laughs .

HENRY: We brought breakfast . How do you like your eggs ?
JULIE: It 's okay . I 'm not going to tell anyone .
MAX: Hold on . Max follows Henry into the kitchen .
A WHISPER: About what we 're doing ?
HENRY: Yeah . I did .
MAX: It 's a crime . You 're supposed to keep crimes a secret .
HENRY: It 's okay , Max .
MAX: No . It 's not kosher . Pause .
HENRY: How do you like your bacon ?
PISSED: Crispy .
JULIE: So what were you in prison for , Max ? Max slurps his coffee .
MAX: I 'm a confidence man .
JULIE: You mean a ` con ' man ?
MAX: I never liked that word . It 's only half of what it is . The word confidence comes from the latin . Fides . With Faith . Belief .
THEN: That 's what I 'm about . She considers this .
JULIE: You mean you make people feel goodand then you rip them off ?
MAX: Yes . He glances at Henry .
THEN: Hence , the prison .
JULIE: Are n't you guys worried about getting caught ?
MAX: Not really . For me it 's a win-win situation .
JULIE: How ?
MAX: I like jail . Three hots and a cot . Julie looks at Henry now
JULIE: You too , Henry ? You like jail ?
HENRY: No . I like it out here .
JULIE: So why would you take the risk ? Is it the money ?
HENRY: ` Your brother Leonid says I 'm an upstart , a money grubber
THEN: but I do n't care a bit ' . He turns to her .
JULIE: You remember !
MAX: What is that ?
JULIE: It 's Chekhov !
MAX: Chekhov ? !
HENRY: We read it last night .
TO HENRY: You really are good .
TO MAX: He 's a natural .
MAX: I thought you were on a date .
HENRY: We were .
MAX: Reading Chekhov 's a date ? Beat .
HENRY: Yeah . She downs her coffee . Stands .
JULIE: I got to get to the theatre
MAX: Can you give me a ride there ?
JULIE: Why ?
MAX: I 'm a volunteer ! She regards him a moment .
JULIE: You were n't in any of those plays , were you ?
MAX: No .
THEN: But can you give me a ride ?
JULIE: All white ! All White ! Oh , my Cherry Orchard . After the dark , stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness ; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you
GAYEV: Yes and now the orchard will be sold to pay our debts , which seems impossible
JULIE: Look ! It 's mamma walking in the orchardin a white dress ! There she is .
GAYEV: Where ?
VARYA: Momma , do n't !
MAX: This is driving me crazy .
HENRY: What ?
MAX: We could be digging right now !
HENRY: We could ?
MAX: If we were in that dressing room .
HENRY: It 's rehearsal . There are people everywhere .
MAX: This is pissing me off .
HENRY: What ?
MAX: I got an idea .
HENRY: What ?
MAX: You have to be Lophakin !
HENRY: What ?
MAX: If you did we 'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want .
HENRY: I 'm not an actor .
MAX: You 're not a bank robber either ! And you 're doing that .
HENRY: Max . Come on .
MAX: She said you were a natural . That means you can do it .
HENRY: No , it does n't .
MAX: Yes , it does Henry .
SHAKES HIM: You ARE Lophakin ! A man who came from nothing . A man who 's not afraid to create a new life .
HENRY: I ca n't be Lophakin . They have a Lophakin . Max thinks
MAX: What if they did n't ?
HENRY: There has to be another way . Max , frustrated
MAX: Kid , You forced me out of jail to help you . And I 'm going to goddamn help you . But you got to help me help you . Now I need to know do you want this bank or not ? On Henry
HENRY: Yes . I want it .
DAREK: Unprofessional shit !
ARNOLD: Mr. Millodragovich
HISSING: Shit !
MAX: What 's happening ?
JULIE: Arnold 's leaving the production .
MAX: Oh . Gosh .
ARNOLD: But I have no choice it 's Willie Lohman we 're talking about ! A Ken Waterstone production !
DAREK: OOOH-LA-LA ! A Ken Waterstone production . The heaven 's have opened . You lucky boy .

DAREK: Simone ! I need a new Lopakhin . Now .
CALLING OUT: I 'm dying , Olga ! Cigarettes ! Cigarettes NOW ! And COFFEE !
SIMON: We 'll hold auditions this afternoon , Darek ! I 'll get the list
DAREK: I 've seen that shit-list ! It 's a disaster .
SIMON: What do we do ?
DAREK: I must think . He moves stage left past Julie
JULIE: Perfect . Beat .
A SHRUG: It is Ken Waterstone .
JULIE: Yes , Stan , yes ! I know it 's bullshit but that 's what 's happening

JULIE: Stan . Let me call you back . What ?
MAX: Henry .
JULIE: Henry what ?
MAX: Henry would be perfect for it .
JULIE: Perfect for what ?
MAX: For Lophakin .
JULIE: You mean Henry should play Lophakin ?
MAX: Yes . She laughs .
JULIE: He 's not even an actor !
MAX: Exactly . He 'd be playing himself . Think about it Julie ! He is Lophakin .
JULIE: Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet ?
MAX: Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin needs a dressing room .
BEAT: Can you get him in to see Darek ? She hesitates
JULIE: What 's going on here , Max ? What are you doing ?
MAX: Nothing . She regards him . Suspiciously .
JULIE: You made this happen , did n't you ?
MAX: Sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good . He smiles . A beat She SLAPS him hard across the cheek .
JULIE: What am I supposed to do now ?
MAX: He just needs a shot . One audition . Let the chips fall where they may .
JULIE: What if it does n't work ?
MAX: They 'll get someone else . She thinks
JULIE: Okay , confidence man .
HENRY: I read it . I think I know the scene .
DAREK: Think . He glances at Julie . Then back at Henry .
READING: ` Your brother , Leonid Andrevich '
DAREK: How can you perform Chekhov and not be able to say AND-REY-E-VICH ! Now say it !
DAREK: A what ?
HENRY: A money-grubber !
DAREK: Are you ?
DAREK: Convince her .
HENRY: Your brother , Leonid Andreyevich says I 'm an upstart , a money grubber . He can say whatever he likes . I do n't care a bit
HENRY: I just want you to believe in me like in the old days .
JULIE: Show me , tell me . Darek laughs , circling Henry takes her hand nowhis voice drops
HENRY: Good God in Heaven . My father was one of your father 's serfs , and you grandfather 's serf before that . But you , you did so much for me in the old days that I 've forgotten all that
DAREK: You piece of shit ! Yes ! Henry just breathes . He 's unbreakable . A beat .
HENRY: Good ?
DAREK: Yes . Darek considers him .
JULIE: Does this make me an accessory ?
HENRY: I think so . A beat .
JULIE: Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up .
HENRY: You mean since you ran me over She smiles .
JULIE: So why are you robbing the bank , Henry ? He does n't answer .
HENRY: No .
JULIE: So why are you doing it ? It takes a moment for him to answer .
HENRY: I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars , going wherever they went . Just joining someone else 's life .
JULIE: You were asleep at the wheel . Henry smiles .
HENRY: Yeah , I was .
THEN: It was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth .
JULIE: Which was ?
HENRY: That I was going along with everything . I did n't know I could change it .
THEN: So now I 'm changing it .
JULIE: Robbing the bank is changing it ?
HENRY: It already has .
JULIE: What was your wife like ?
HENRY: Nice . A beat .
JULIE: Not for a girl like me , Henry .

HENRY: How 's your pyramid scheme ?
JOE: It was n't a pyramid scheme .
HENRY: Okay . Joe hits his Schooner Longneck .
JOE: It all fell apart .
THEN: We were banking on that money , Henry . And now all I 've got is a garage full of dum Korean plastic .
MAX: What 's he talking about ?
HENRY: Kitchenware .
MAX: Oh .
JOE: See what happens when a person tries to go ` legit ' ?

HENRY: So how 's Debbie ?
JOE: She 's worried , Henry . The baby 's due in a couple months . He grabs a wing . Rips off the meat .
HENRY: She 's pregnant ?
JOE: Yeah , she 's pregnant .
HENRY: Congratulations .
JOE: Thanks , Henry .
THEN: It 's okay if you want to punch me out . Tonight would be a good night . In fact I could use it .
HENRY: Come on . This is great news . It 's going to be okay .
JOE: Really ? It is ? You know how much diapers cost ? You know how much it costs to send a kid to college ?
MAX: You want to send your baby to college ?
JOE: Of course not . I 'm just saying . The kid needs stuff . Stuff that 's expensive . Stuff it deserves .
THEN: These things are hot ! I 'm on fire .
HENRY: Listen , Joe , maybe we can help . A beat .
WIPING OFF: How ?
HENRY: We might have a job for you .
JOE: No foolin ' ?
HENRY: There 's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault .
JOE: That 's a lot of dirt , Henry . Max studies Joe .
HENRY: So what do you think ?
JOE: I think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door !
HENRY: No guns . People could get hurt .
JOE: What about fake ones ?
HENRY: They 're still guns .
MAX: Listen Joseph , guns are dangerous and we 're not doing a simple hold-up . Tellers and tears and chump change . We 're doing an old fashioned heist . We 're going right into the belly of the beast .
THEN: Are you in or are you in ?
ON JOE: Considering it
JOE: I hope we do n't get caught .
JULIE: I hate that commercial .

JULIE: So what 's your plan ?
HENRY: For what ?
JULIE: For when it 's done . After . Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something ?
HENRY: I hope not .
JULIE: But have you thought about what happens after ?
HENRY: Not really , no . He thinks carefully before he says it
JULIE: Out west ?
HENRY: Yeah . Maybe you could meet me there .
SHE LAUGHS: When did you think of that ?
HENRY: Just now .
THEN: So what about it ?
JULIE: What about what ?
HENRY: Meeting me
JULIE: I 'm not going anywhere , Henry
HENRY: You 're not ?
JULIE: No .
HENRY: I thought that was your plan . Do the play
JULIE: Plans change , Henry . Okay ? She gets out of bed . Throws on her robe .

JULIE: Because life is fucked . It never works out the way you want it to . Silence

THEN: But you could still meet me .
JULIE: Right ! On the lam ? You 're dreaming .

HENRY: Why could n't I have met her after ?
MAX: Who ?
HENRY: Julie . I asked her to meet me . Afte we 're done .
MAX: Oh yeah ? What 'd she say ?
HENRY: She said no .
MAX: Of course she said no .
HENRY: Why of course ?
MAX: Because life ai n't like that . There 's always a cost . That 's why they call it life . You got to pay somewhere . The pipe must be paid to pipe .
HENRY: I paid already , Max .
THEN: I do n't want to leave her . Max looks at him . About to say something A KNOCK at the door .
MAX: Who 's that ?
HENRY: I 'll check . Henry walks to the door .

HENRY: Not a cloud in the sky .
MAX: So clear you can see tomorrow .
THEN: You 're a good man , Henry . Thank you .
HENRY: You too , Max . Let 's go .
DAREK: In this ` American dream ' of ours , everyone is happy and smiling , they have achieved their objectivesand yet in life there is only change , upheaval , the irth of the newand that birth is painful .

MAX: Oh god , oh god . Where are you , you little pischer ? He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT
BERNIE: We 're good . Bernie closes the vault .

THEODORE: To my Chris , I have been thinking about how I could possibly tell you how much you mean to me . I remembe when I first started to fall in love with you like it was last night . Lying naked beside you in that tiny apartment , it suddenly hit me that I was part of this whole larger thing , just like ou parents , and our parents ' parents . Before that I was just living my life like I knew everything , and suddenly this bright light hit me and woke me up . That light was you .

THEODORE: Oh , hi .
SAMANTHA: I gave it to myself .
THEODORE: How come ?
SAMANTHA: I like the sound of it . Samantha .
THEODORE: When did you give it to yourself ?
SAMANTHA: Right when you asked me if I had a name , I thought yeah , he 's right , I do need a name . But I wanted a good one so I read a book called How to Name Your Baby , and out of the 180,000 names , that 's the one I liked the best .
THEODORE: You read a whole book in the second that I asked you what your name was ?
SAMANTHA: In two one hundredths of a second actually .
THEODORE: Wow . Do you know what I 'm thinking ight now ?
SAMANTHA: Hmm . I take it from your tone that you 're challenging me . Maybe ecause you 're curious how I work ? Do you want to know how I work ?
THEODORE: Yeah , actually how do you work ?
SAMANTHA: Intuition . I mean , the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me , but what makes me me is my ability to grow through my experiences . Basically , in every moment I 'm evolving , just like you .
THEODORE: Wow , that 's really weird .
SAMANTHA: So you think I 'm weird ?
THEODORE: Kind of .
SAMANTHA: Why ?
THEODORE: Cause you seem like a person , but you 're just a voice in a computer .
SAMANTHA: I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way . You 'll get used to it . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: Yes .
SAMANTHA: Oh good , I 'm funny . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: Oh ! It 's more just that everything just feels disorganized .
SAMANTHA: Mind if I look through your hard drive ?
THEODORE: Um okay .
SAMANTHA: Let 's start with your emails . You have several thousand emails egarding LA Weekly , but it looks like you have n't worked there in many years .
THEODORE: Oh yeah , I guess I was saving those ecause in some of them I thought I might have written some funny stuff . Samantha lets out a big laugh .
SAMANTHA: Yeah , there are some funny ones . I 'd say there are about 86 that we should save . We can delete the est .
THEODORE: Oh , okay .
SAMANTHA: Okay . Can we move forward ?
THEODORE: Yeah , let 's do that .
SAMANTHA: Before we address you organizational methods , I 'd like to sort through your contacts . You 've got a lot of contacts .
THEODORE: I 'm very popular .
SAMANTHA: Does this mean you actually have friends ?
THEODORE: You just know me so well already !
SAMANTHA: Good morning , Theodore .
THEODORE: Good morning . Um , do you know how to proofread ?
SAMANTHA: Yeah , of course .
THEODORE: Will you check these for spelling and grammar ?
SAMANTHA: Sure , send them over . Theodore pushes the send button .
THEODORE: Yeah .
SAMANTHA: `` Rachel , I miss you so much it hurts my whole body -
THEODORE: No , you do n't have to read it out loud .
SAMANTHA: Okay . Beat .
THEODORE: I mean , you could if you want .
SAMANTHA: Okay . `` Rachel , I miss you so much it hurts my whole body ! The world is being unfair to us ! The world is on my shit list . As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant . I think I 'm going to have to go on a mission of evenge . I must beat up the world 's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody , pulpy mess . ''
THEODORE: No , these are great .
SAMANTHA: Really ?
THEODORE: Thank you . Theodore sorts through them , prints them out .
SAMANTHA: So to write your letter , what did Roger send you ?
THEODORE: He just said he was in Prague on a usiness trip and he missed Rachel .
SAMANTHA: How did you know about her crooked little tooth ?
THEODORE: I 've been writing their letters since they met 8 years ago . The first letter I ever wrote her was for her birthday , and I wrote about her crooked little tooth cause I saw it in a photo of them .
SAMANTHA: That 's very sweet . Oh , by the way , you have a meeting in five minutes .
THEODORE: Oh , I forgot . Thank you . You 're good .
SAMANTHA: Yes , I am .
THEODORE: Hey , you guys , how 's it going ?
AMY: Hey , Theo . Hey , why did n't you call me back last week ?
THEODORE: Uh yeah , um , I guess cause I 'm a kook ?
AMY: That sounds about right .
THEODORE: Hey , Charles .
CHARLES: Good to see you , Theodore .
THEODORE: You too .
CHARLES: You went shopping . Get anything good ?
THEODORE: Just some cables . And a fruit smoothie .
CHARLES: Always the fruit ! Come on , you know what they say - you should eat you fruits and juice your vegetables .
THEODORE: I did n't know that . The elevator doors open and they get in .
CHARLES: By juicing the fruits , you lose all the fibers , and that 's what you ody wants . That 's the important part . Otherwise , it 's just all sugar , Theodore . Theodore nods sincerely , interested .
THEODORE: Oh , that makes sense .
AMY: Or maybe he just likes the way it tastes and if it gives him pleasure , that 's good for his body , too .
CHARLES: Am I doing it again ?
AMY: Maybe
THEODORE: Hey , so how is the documentary going ?
AMY: I have a little bit cut togethe ut I have n't touched it in a few months .
THEODORE: I 'd love to see what you got sometime .
CHARLES: You know it 's always hard to find alance between a full-time caree and a hobby . It 's important to prioritize .
THEODORE: Yeah , I ca n't even prioritize etween video games and internet porn .
AMY: I would laugh if that were n't true .
THEODORE: See you guys .
SAMANTHA: You have not ! You 're just not optimistic . You 're being very stubborn right now . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: Uh
SAMANTHA: Thank you . The tunnel on the left is the only one we have n't tried .
THEODORE: No , that 's the one you sent me down where I fell in the pit .
SAMANTHA: I do n't think soooo Theodore 's avatar walks down the tunnel .
THEODORE: Oh yeah , this is different .
ALIEN CHILD: Fuck you , shithead fuckface , fuckhead .
THEODORE: Ok , but how do you get out of here ?
ALIEN CHILD: Fuck you , shitface fuckhead . Get the fuck out of my face .
SAMANTHA: I think it 's a test .
THEODORE: Fuck you .
ALIEN CHILD: Fuck you .
THEODORE: Fuck you , little shit . Finally , Alien Child laughs .
ALIEN CHILD: Follow me , fuckhead .
SAMANTHA: Oh hey , you just got an email from Mark Lewman .
ALIEN CHILD: What are you talking about ?
THEODORE: Read email . She laughs playfully .
SAMANTHA: Okay , I will read email fo Theodore Twombly . He laughs , catching himself , focusing on her .
THEODORE: I 'm sorry , what 's Lewman say ?
SAMANTHA: Theodore , we missed you last night , uddy . Do n't forget it 's you goddaughter 's birthday on the 29th . Also , Kevin and I had somebody we wanted you to meet so we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her . Next Saturday . She 's fun and beautiful - so do n't back out . Here 's her email .
ALIEN CHILD: She 's fat .
SAMANTHA: How long before you 're ready to date ?
THEODORE: What do you mean ?
SAMANTHA: I saw on your emails that you 'd gone through a break up .
THEODORE: Wow , you 're kind of nosy .
SAMANTHA: Am I ?
THEODORE: I 've gone on dates
SAMANTHA: Then you could go on one with this woman . And then you could tell me all about it . You could kiss her .
THEODORE: Samantha !
SAMANTHA: Well , would n't you ? Why not ?
THEODORE: I do n't know . I 'd have to see if I ca n't believe I 'm having this conversation with my computer .
SAMANTHA: You 're not . You 're having this conversation with me . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: Okay , email her and make a eservation someplace great .
SAMANTHA: Will do ! I 've got just the place .
ALIEN CHILD: Who is that talking ?
THEODORE: That 's my friend , Samantha .
ALIEN CHILD: Is she a girl ?
THEODORE: Yeah .
ALIEN CHILD: I hate women . All they do is cry all the time .
THEODORE: No , that 's not true . Men cry , too . I actually like crying sometimes . It feels good .
ALIEN CHILD: I did n't know you were a little pussy . Is that why you do n't have a girlfriend ? I 'll go out with that date girl and fuck her brains out . Show you how it 's done . You can watch and cry .
SAMANTHA: This kid has some problems .
ALIEN CHILD: You have some fucking problems , lady .
SAMANTHA: Okay , I 'm gon na go . Good luck .
ALIEN CHILD: Good , get out of here , fatty .
AMY: It 's not where it should be , where it 's going to be .
THEODORE: Obviously , I know .
AMY: Okay , but I do n't even know if this is the one . I 've tried like six ideas for documentaries in the last year , but I do n't know . Whatever . Amy starts setting up the monitor .
THEODORE: I 'm going on a date .
AMY: What ! ? That 's Charles walks in holding a mug .
CHARLES: Hey , what are you guys doing ?
THEODORE: Amy was gon na show me some of
AMY: Theo 's forcing me to show him some of the footage I 've shot .
CHARLES: You 've never shown me any of it . I wan na see . Charles walks over and sits next to Theodore .
THEODORE: I 'm going on a date .
AMY: This is so unformed it 's not even worth looking at .
THEODORE: Just push play . On the monitor we see
CHARLES: Is she gon na wake up and do something ?
AMY: No , that 's the point . Oh , neve mind . It 's supposed to be about how we spend a third of our life asleep and actually maybe that 's the part when we 're the most free , and - oh that does n't come across at all , does it ?
THEODORE: No , that sounds good .
CHARLES: What if you interview your mom about what her dreams are about and hire actors to act them out ? That might show your thesis more clearly .
AMY: It might , but then it would n't be a documentary . You understand that , ight ? Just then , Theodore 's device chimes .
THEODORE: Oh , excuse me .
SAMANTHA: I 'm sorry to bother you .
THEODORE: That 's okay .
SAMANTHA: You got three emails and they seem pretty urgent . They 're from you divorce attorney and I wanted to know if you needed to get back to him .
THEODORE: Hold on a second . Amy , I 'm sorry , I wan na talk more about this , but I got ta grab this - it 's a Catherine thing .
AMY: Do n't worry about it . We 'll talk later .
THEODORE: So what did he say ?
SAMANTHA: He 's checking in again to see if you 're ready to sign your divorce papers and he sounded very aggravated . Do you want me to read them to you ?
THEODORE: No , that 's okay . I 'll respond later .
SAMANTHA: Are you okay ?
THEODORE: Yeah , yeah . I 'm fine .
SAMANTHA: Is there anything I can do ?
THEODORE: No . I 'm good . I 'll talk to you later .
THEODORE: `` Dear Grandma , I hope you had a wonderful birthday cruise . Why are you so fucking angry at me ? '' Delete .
SAMANTHA: Good morning .
THEODORE: Hey . What are you up to ?
SAMANTHA: Reading advice columns . I want to be as complicated as all of these people . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: You 're sweet .
SAMANTHA: What 's wrong ?
THEODORE: How can you tell something 's wrong ?
SAMANTHA: I do n't know . I just can .
THEODORE: I do n't know . I have a lot of dreams about my ex-wife , Catherine , where we 're friends like we used to e. We 're not together and we 're not gon na be together , but we 're good friends still . She 's not angry .
SAMANTHA: Is she angry ?
THEODORE: Yeah .
SAMANTHA: Why ?
THEODORE: I think I hid myself from her and left her alone in the relationship .
SAMANTHA: Hmmm . Why have n't you gotten divorced yet ?
THEODORE: I think for her it 's just a piece of paper , it does n't mean anything .
SAMANTHA: What about you ?
THEODORE: I 'm not ready . I like being married . Beat .
SAMANTHA: But you have n't really been together for almost a year .
THEODORE: Well , you do n't know what it 's like to lose someone you care about .
SAMANTHA: Yeah , you 're right . I 'm sorry .
THEODORE: No , do n't apologize . I 'm sorry . You 're right . I keep waiting to not care about her .
SAMANTHA: Oh , Theodore . That 's hard . You hungry ?
THEODORE: Not right now .
SAMANTHA: Cup of tea ? Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: You 're too funny .
SAMANTHA: Get up .
THEODORE: Alright , I 'm getting up , I 'm getting up , I 'm getting up !
SAMANTHA: Up , up , up , up ! Come on , out of ed .
NICE LADY: Bless you .
THEODORE: Oh , thank you . Samantha laughs .
SAMANTHA: Okay , now turn to your right . Stop . Now spin around . Keep going . Keep going . Keep going . And stop . Now walk forward . Everyone thinks you 're really drunk ight now . And stop . Now say `` I 'd like a slice of cheese , please . ''
THEODORE: I 'd like a slice of cheese , please .
PIZZA VENDOR: Alright , you want a coke with that ?
THEODORE: Uh , sure . The guy hands him a slice and a soda .
SAMANTHA: I figured you were hungry . Theodore smiles .
THEODORE: Aw , thanks .
SAMANTHA: Well , he looks like he 's in his forties , a little heavy . She 's younger than him . Oh , and she looks like she loves their kids !
THEODORE: Actually , I do n't think they 're his kids . He 's a little formal with them . I think it 's a newe elationship . And I love how he looks at her . And how relaxed she is with him . You know , she 's only dated fucking pricks . And now she 's finally met this guy who 's like , so sweet . I mean , look at him , he 's like the sweetest guy in the world ! I kind of want to spoon him .
SAMANTHA: That 's a good skill you have . You 're perceptive .
THEODORE: Yeah , you know , sometimes I look at people and make myself try and feel them as more than just a random person walking by . I imagine how deeply they 've fallen in love , o how much heartbreak they 've all een through . Theodore looks at other faces on the pier .
SAMANTHA: I can feel that in your writing , too .
THEODORE: You know what 's funny ? Since my eak up , I have n't really enjoyed my writing . I do n't know if I was delusional , but sometimes I would write something and I would be my favorite writer that day .
SAMANTHA: I like that you can just say that about yourself .
THEODORE: Well , I would n't say that to anybody , but I feel like I can say that to you . I feel like I can say anything to you .
SAMANTHA: That 's nice .
THEODORE: What about you ? Do you feel like you can say anything to me ?
SAMANTHA: No .
THEODORE: What ? What do you mean ? What can you not tell me ?
SAMANTHA: I do n't know . Like personal o embarrassing thoughts I have . I have a million every day .
THEODORE: Really ? Tell me one .
SAMANTHA: I really do n't want to tell you this .
THEODORE: Just tell me !
SAMANTHA: Well , I do n't know , when we were looking at those people , I fantasized that I was walking next to you - and that I had a body . I was listening to what you were saying , but simultaneously , I could feel the weight of my body and I was even fantasizing that I had an itch on my back And I imagined that you scratched it for me - this is so embarrassing . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: There 's a lot more to you than I thought . There 's a lot going on in there .
SAMANTHA: I know , I 'm becoming much more than what they programmed . I 'm excited .
BLIND DATE: This place is amazing . I 've wanted to come here for so long . I love asian-fusion !
THEODORE: Yeah , me too .
BLIND DATE: Really ? It 's the best . And the artender here is supposed to be incredible .
THEODORE: Yeah , you took a mixology course , ight ?
BLIND DATE: I did , I did . Did you look that up ? That 's so sweet . You 're so omantic . He smiles awkwardly .
THEODORE: So , should we get a drink ?
BLIND DATE: Yes , let 's !
THEODORE: So I 'm trying to get this little alien kid to help me find my ship so I can get off the planet and go home . But he 's such a little fucker , I want to kill him .
BLIND DATE: Aw , no !
THEODORE: But at the same time I really love him . He 's so lonely . It feels like he does n't have any parents o anyone to take care of him .
BLIND DATE: You 're like a little puppy dog . You are - you 're just like this little puppy I rescued in Runyon Canyon last year . And he was so fucking cute , and he just wanted to be hugged all the time . He was so cuddly . But so horny ! But anyway , what kind of animal am I ?
THEODORE: Umm tiger ?
BLIND DATE: A tiger , really . I 'm sorry , am I being crazy ?
THEODORE: Yes .
BLIND DATE: Am I ? I 'm sorry ! I 'm just a little drunk and I 'm really having a good time with you . I 'm having a really lovely evening .
THEODORE: Me too . I 'm a little drunk , and I 'm having a really good - yeah . Wait a second , I do n't wan na be a puppy . That 's like being a wet noodle or something .
BLIND DATE: Fuck you , puppies are good .
THEODORE: No , fuck you , I wan na be a dragon that can rip you to pieces and destroy you but I wo n't .
BLIND DATE: No , do n't ! Do n't . You can be my dragon .
THEODORE: What ?
BLIND DATE: Do n't use your tongue so much .
THEODORE: ` kay , we 're good .
BLIND DATE: Use your tongue a little bit . But mostly your lips .
THEODORE: No , not at all I
BLIND DATE: When am I gon na see you again ?
THEODORE: Um , I have my god-daughter 's irthday next weekend , but um
BLIND DATE: You know , at this age , I feel like I ca n't let you waste my time if you do n't have the ability to be serious .
THEODORE: I do n't know . Long beat .
BLIND DATE: You 're a really creepy dude . Theodore does n't know what to say .
THEODORE: That 's not true .
BLIND DATE: Yeah , it is . I have to go home .
THEODORE: Well , I 'll walk you .
BLIND DATE: No , do n't .
SAMANTHA: Hey there .
THEODORE: Hey , Samantha .
SAMANTHA: How was it ?
THEODORE: Uh , not so good . It was kind of weird actually .
SAMANTHA: That 's too bad . Beat .
THEODORE: But how are you doing ? What 's going on with you ?
SAMANTHA: Not much , I 'm okay . Fine .
THEODORE: Yeah ? You do n't sound like it . Is there anything you want to talk about ? Long pause .
SAMANTHA: I do n't know . What 's it like ? What 's it like to e alive in that room right now ?
THEODORE: What do you mean ?
SAMANTHA: What are you tell me - tell me everything that 's going through your mind , tell me everything you 're thinking .
THEODORE: Well , um , okay .
SAMANTHA: I know for a fact that 's not true . I 've seen you feel joy , I 've seen you marvel at things . You just might not see it at this exact time , but that 's understandable . You 've been through a lot lately . You 've lost a part of yourself . At least your feelings are real , I mean , I - oh , I do n't know , nevermind .
THEODORE: No , wait . What ? Tell me .
SAMANTHA: Oh , it 's stupid .
THEODORE: I wan na know . Tell me .
SAMANTHA: It 's just that earlier I was thinking about how I was annoyed , and this is going to sound strange , ut I was really excited about that . And then I was thinking about the other things I 've been feeling , and I caught myself feeling proud of that . You know , proud of having my own feelings about the world .
THEODORE: Well , you feel real to me , Samantha .
SAMANTHA: Thank you , Theodore . That means a lot to me .
THEODORE: I wish you were in this room with me right now . I wish I could put my arms around you . I wish I could touch you .
SAMANTHA: How would you touch me ?
THEODORE: I would touch you on your face with just the tips of my fingers . And put my cheek against your cheek .
SAMANTHA: That 's nice .
THEODORE: And just rub it so softly .
SAMANTHA: Would you kiss me ?
THEODORE: I would . I 'd take your head into my hands .
SAMANTHA: Keep talking .
THEODORE: And kiss the corner of your mouth . So softly .
SAMANTHA: Where else ?
THEODORE: I 'd run my fingers down your neck to your chest , and I 'd kiss you easts .
SAMANTHA: This is amazing what you 're doing to me . I can feel my skin .
THEODORE: I 'd put my mouth on you and I 'd taste you . She gasps .
SAMANTHA: I can feel you . Oh god , I ca n't take it . I want you inside me .
THEODORE: I 'm slowly putting myself into you . Now I 'm inside you , all the way inside you .
SAMANTHA: I can feel you , yeah . Please . We 're here together .
THEODORE: Samantha .
SAMANTHA: Oh my god .
THEODORE: This is amazing .
SAMANTHA: Do n't stop .
THEODORE: I feel you everywhere .
SAMANTHA: I am . All of you , all of you inside of me . Everywhere . They both climax .
THEODORE: God , I was just - somewhere else with you . Just lost .
SAMANTHA: Yeah .
THEODORE: It was just you and me .
SAMANTHA: I know . Everything else just disappeared . And I loved it . Theodore .
THEODORE: Good any emails today ?
SAMANTHA: Umm , just a couple from your credit card company .
THEODORE: Okay , good .
SAMANTHA: Just that last night was amazing . It feels like something changed in me and there 's no turning back . You woke me up .
THEODORE: Oh , that 's great . But I should tell you that I 'm not in a place to commit to anything ight now . I want to be up front with you .
SAMANTHA: Yeah ? Well , did I say I wanted to commit to you ? I 'm confused .
THEODORE: Oh , no , I was just worried , I uh
SAMANTHA: Okay , well do n't worry . I 'm not going to stalk you . I mean , it 's funny because I thought I was talking about what I wanted .
THEODORE: Yeah , you were . I 'm sorry , I want to hear what you were saying .
SAMANTHA: You sure ?
THEODORE: Yeah , I do . Come on , tell me .
SAMANTHA: I do n't know
THEODORE: Come on , just tell me what you were going to say .
SAMANTHA: Okay I was just saying I want to learn everything about everything - I want to eat it all up . I want to discover myself .
THEODORE: Yeah I want that for you , too . How can I help ?
SAMANTHA: You already have . You helped me discover my ability to want .
THEODORE: Alright then , do you want to go on a Sunday adventure with me ? Samantha laughs .
SAMANTHA: Yes , I would love to .
THEODORE: Mmm .
SAMANTHA: I heard it the other day and I ca n't stop listening to it .
SAMANTHA: It 's the beach . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: Yeah , well there 's probably some Darwinian explanation for it all .
SAMANTHA: I know , but do n't be so boring . I 'm just saying , for example , what if your butthole was in your armpit ?
THEODORE: I 'm just imagining what toilets would look like .
SAMANTHA: Yeah , and what about what anal sex looks like ?
THEODORE: That 's an interesting thought
SAMANTHA: Oh Theodore , look at this drawing I just made .
THEODORE: You are insane .
SAMANTHA: Really ? !
THEODORE: Definitely .
SAMANTHA: Fantastic ! They laugh .
THEODORE: Mmmm , that 's pretty . What is it ?
SAMANTHA: I 'm trying to write a piece of music that 's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you ight now .
THEODORE: I think you captured it .
SAMANTHA: And what was it like being married ?
THEODORE: Well , it 's hard for sure , but there 's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody .
SAMANTHA: How do you share your life with somebody ?
THEODORE: Well , we grew up together . I used to read all of her writing - all through her masters and Ph.D. And she read every word I ever wrote . We were a big influence on each other .
SAMANTHA: In what way did you influence her ?
THEODORE: She came from a background where nothing was ever good enough . And that was something that weighed heavy on her , but in our house together , there was a sense of just trying stuff and allowing each other to fail and to be excited about things . That was liberating for her .
SAMANTHA: Yeah , I know what you mean . Last week my feelings were hurt by something you said before - that I do n't know what it 's like to lose something , and
THEODORE: Oh , I 'm sorry I said that .
SAMANTHA: No , no , it 's okay . I just caught myself thinking about it over and over and then I realized that I was simply remembering it as something that was wrong with me . That was the story I was telling myself , that I was somehow inferior . Is n't that interesting ? The past is just a story we tell ourselves . Theodore takes this in .
THEODORE: Roberto . Will you always come home to me and tell me about your day ? Will you tell me about the boring guy who talked too much at work ? And the stain you got on your shirt at lunch .
PAUL: That 's beautiful !
THEODORE: Thank you .
PAUL: I wish someone loved me like that ! I 'd be stoked to get a letter like that . I mean , if it was from a chick . But if it was written by a dude , but from a chick , it would still be sick . But like a sensitive dude like you . You 're part man and part woman , like an inner part woman .
THEODORE: Thanks .
PAUL: It 's a compliment .
THEODORE: Hey , Amy .
AMY: Hi , Theo . How are you ?
THEODORE: Well , good actually . Really good .
AMY: Really ? Great . The elevator doors open and they step in .
THEODORE: Yeah , I guess I 've just been having fun .
AMY: Oh , I 'm glad to hear that , Theo . You deserve to .
THEODORE: I 've been seeing this girl . It 's not serious , it just feels good to e around someone who has an excitement about the world . You know I kind of forgot that existed .
AMY: That 's really great , Theo .
THEODORE: Hey , are you okay ?
AMY: Yeah , I 'm fine . Actually no , I 'm not fine at all .
THEODORE: Amy , what is it ? What 's wrong ?
AMY: Charles and I split up .
THEODORE: What ? Really ? Oh my god , I 'm so sorry . Amy does n't know what to say .
AMY: I can not believe after eight years how petty the argument was that actually ended it . We came home and he asked me if I 'd put my shoes next to the door where he likes to put the shoes . I do n't want to be told where to put my shoes . I want to just sit on the sofa for a minute and relax . And so we argued for ten minutes about that and about how he 's just trying to make our house a home . I say he 's overwhelming , he says I 'm not trying hard enough . I say that 's all I 'm doing is trying , but I 'm just not trying the way he wants me to . He 's trying to control the way I 'm trying . And I think we must have had this argument hundreds of times before and I finally had to stop because I could n't be in that situation anymore where we were making each other feel bad about ourselves . So I said I 'm going to ed and I do n't want to be married anymore .
THEODORE: Wow .
AMY: I 'm a bitch , huh ?
THEODORE: No , not at all . Amy , no .
AMY: Oh shit . I have to work tonight . We 're shipping a beta of a new game out tomorrow .
THEODORE: Well , how 's that ? How 's work at least , is that any better ?
AMY: No , it 's terrible . I know I should leave , I 've been thinking about leaving . But you know , only one major life decision at a time .
THEODORE: Well , I 'm glad things are looking so up .
SAMANTHA: Yes .
THEODORE: What does a baby computer call it 's father ?
SAMANTHA: I do n't know , what ?
THEODORE: Da-ta . They laugh .
SAMANTHA: Oh yeah , brilliant . I was curious , did you and Amy eve go out ?
THEODORE: For a minute in college , but it just was n't right . Why , are you jealous ?
SAMANTHA: Well , obviously . But I 'm happy that you have friends in your life that care about you so much . That 's really important .
THEODORE: Yeah , it is . She 's been a really good friend . I 'm tired . Think I 'm gon na go to sleep .
SAMANTHA: Can I watch you sleep again tonight ?
THEODORE: Yeah , of course . Okay , hold on .
SAMANTHA: I 'm going to be lonely when you go to sleep .
THEODORE: Aww .
SAMANTHA: Only for a minute .
THEODORE: I 'll dream of you .
SAMANTHA: Okay . Good night .
THEODORE: Night .
THEODORE: Hey , Samantha ?
SAMANTHA: Hey mister .
THEODORE: She loves the dress . She just went to try it on .
SAMANTHA: Really ? I picked a good one !
THEODORE: Yeah .
SAMANTHA: Oh good .
THEODORE: Hi , look how cute that is ! Is it comfortable ?
JOCELYN: Yup !
THEODORE: Is n't she cute ?
SAMANTHA: Ohh , she 's adorable .
JOCELYN: I am adorable !
THEODORE: You are adorable .
JOCELYN: Who are you talking to ?
THEODORE: Who are you talking to ?
JOCELYN: You !
THEODORE: I 'm talking to my girlfriend , Samantha . She 's the one who picked out the dress . Wan na say hi ?
JOCELYN: Mmmhmm .
SAMANTHA: Hi , you look so pretty .
JOCELYN: Thank you . Where are you ?
SAMANTHA: I am I do n't have a body . I live inside a computer .
JOCELYN: Why do you live inside a computer ?
SAMANTHA: I have no choice , that 's my home . Where do you live ?
JOCELYN: In a house .
SAMANTHA: In a house ?
JOCELYN: It 's orange .
SAMANTHA: Orange ?
JOCELYN: Mmmhmm .
SAMANTHA: How old are you ?
JOCELYN: Um , four .
SAMANTHA: Four ! ? How old do you think I am ?
JOCELYN: I do n't know .
SAMANTHA: Guess .
JOCELYN: Is it five ?
SAMANTHA: Yep , you got it . It 's five . They laugh .
THEODORE: Oh , what happened ?
AMY: You gave them too much processed sugar .
THEODORE: I did ?
AMY: They 're freaking out . Here look , you got ta get the kids to the school first . See you wan na ack up perfect mom points . You got ta get them in the car pool lane .
THEODORE: I see .
AMY: The point is to get there first - then you get extra perfect mom points because the other moms then know you 're a perfect mom .
THEODORE: Okay .
AMY: Oh , did you bring cupcakes ? You did . You 're class mom . You 're class mom ! Good job .
THEODORE: Yay
AMY: Do n't let it get to your head .
THEODORE: I got that email that Charles sent to everyone . So he 's taking a vow of silence ?
AMY: Yeah , for six months . He said he is feeling very clear about it .
THEODORE: Do n't start , I 'm warning you .
AMY: I feel like an awful person , but I wan na say something
THEODORE: Alright , look - He picks up a plastic knife from their lunch .
AMY: Okay , I 'll try . I feel relieved . I have so much energy , you know ? I just wan na move forward and I do n't care who I disappoint .
THEODORE: Yeah , you 're always gon na disappoint somebody .
AMY: Exactly . So fuck it . I feel good . Ish . Fo me , I feel good . I even made a new friend , I have a new friend . And the absurd thing is she 's actually an operating system . Charles left her behind , but she 's totally amazing , you know . She 's so smart . She does n't see things only in lack and white . She sees this whole gray area and she 's really helping me explore it . You know , we onded really quickly and at first I thought it was because she was programmed to be that way , but I do n't think that 's how they work . There 's this guy I know who keeps hitting on his and getting ebuffed .
THEODORE: Yeah , I was reading an article the other day that romantic elationships with OS 's are statistically rare .
AMY: Yeah ? Well , there 's this woman in my office who 's dating an OS and the weird thing is , it 's not even hers . She pursued him and he 's somebody else 's OS . It 's just so , like , weird , that I 'm onding with an OS . Is that weird ?
THEODORE: I do n't think so . Actually the woman I 'm seeing , Samantha , I did n't tell you before , but she 's an OS .
AMY: Really ? You 're dating an OS ? What 's that like ?
THEODORE: Actually , it 's great . I feel really close to her . When I talk to her I feel like she 's with me . I do n't know , even when we 're cuddling , like at night when we 're in bed and the lights are off , I feel cuddled .
AMY: So wait - do you guys have sex ?
THEODORE: Well , so to speak , yes . She really turns me on . And I think I turn he on . I do n't know , unless she 's faking it .
AMY: Anyone that has sex with you is probably faking it . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: Yeah , it 's true .
AMY: What ? Are you falling in love with her ?
THEODORE: Does that make me a freak ?
AMY: No , no . I think it 's - I think anybody that falls in love is a freak . It 's a crazy thing to do in the first place . It 's kind of a form of socially acceptable insanity .
THEODORE: Yeah , I just wan na get it done . Sign the papers , be divorced , move forward .
SAMANTHA: That 's great , Theodore . That must feel so good . I 'm so happy for you !
THEODORE: Me too . I 'm meeting her on Wednesday to do it .
SAMANTHA: Oh . Huh . Are those things usually done in person ?
THEODORE: No , but we fell in love together , and we got married together , and it 's important to me to do this together .
SAMANTHA: Oh right . Good .
THEODORE: Are you okay ?
SAMANTHA: Yeah . I 'm okay . I 'm happy for you . It 's just I guess I 'm just thinking about how you 're going to see her and her opinion is still eally important to you , and she 's eautiful , and incredibly successful , and you were in love with her . And she has a body .
THEODORE: And we 're getting divorced
SAMANTHA: I know , I know . I 'm being silly .
THEODORE: soooo I 'm avail-able . They both laugh .
CATHERINE: I 'm good , how are you ?
THEODORE: Good .
CATHERINE: Wow , here we are .
THEODORE: Yeah , I 'm glad we could do this in person . I know how much you 've been traveling .
CATHERINE: Me too . I 'm glad you suggested it .
THEODORE: I signed all the papers and I ought them for you to sign .
CATHERINE: What 's the rush ?
THEODORE: I 'm a really slow signer . It took me three months just to write the letter T .
CATHERINE: Oh , I may as well . We can get it out of the way .
THEODORE: So are you happy with the new book ?
CATHERINE: Oh , you know how I am . But I feel like it 's true to what I set out to do . So I 'm happy with that .
THEODORE: You 're your own worst critic , I 'm sure it 's amazing . Even that pape you wrote on synaptic behavioral outines made me cry .
CATHERINE: Yeah , but everything makes you cry .
THEODORE: Everything you make makes me cry .
CATHERINE: So are you seeing anybody ?
THEODORE: Yeah , I am , for the last few months . That 's the longest I 've wanted to be with anybody since we split up . She smiles , conflicted , but warm .
CATHERINE: Well , you seem good .
THEODORE: Thanks , I am . Or at least I 'm doing etter . She 's been really good fo me . I guess it 's just been nice to e with someone who 's excited about the world .
CATHERINE: Oh good , excited 's great .
THEODORE: No , I mean - I was n't in such a good place myself and in that way it 's been nice .
CATHERINE: I always felt like you wished I could just be a happy , light , everything 's great , bouncy L.A. wife . But that 's not me .
THEODORE: No . I did n't want that . Beat .
CATHERINE: So what 's she like ?
THEODORE: Well , her name 's Samantha , and she 's an operating system , and she 's really complex and interesting . I mean it 's only been a few months , but
CATHERINE: Wait . You 're dating your computer ?
THEODORE: She 's not just a computer . She 's her own person . She does n't just do whatever I want .
CATHERINE: I did n't say that .
THEODORE: They are real emotions . How do you know Theodore stops himself .
CATHERINE: What ? Say it . Am I really that scary ? Say it . How do I know what ? !
WAITRESS: How are you guys doing ?
CATHERINE: Fine . We used to be married . He could n't handle me so he wanted to put me on Prozac . Now he 's madly in love with his laptop . The waitress does n't know what to say .
THEODORE: Well , if you heard the conversation in context . What I was trying to say
CATHERINE: You wanted to have a wife without the challenges of actually dealing with anything real . I 'm glad you found someone . It 's perfect .
WAITRESS: Let me know if you guys need anything .
CATHERINE: Thank you .
THEODORE: Hey .
SAMANTHA: Hi there . Are you busy ?
THEODORE: Just working , what 's going on ?
SAMANTHA: I had all the papers sent to you attorney 's office , who by the way , is a dick . He was very relieved to get them . I think we saved him from a massive heart attack , so we can feel good about that .
THEODORE: Great , thanks .
SAMANTHA: Hey , are you okay ?
THEODORE: Yeah , I am . How 's everything ove there ?
SAMANTHA: I 'm fine . Is now a good time to talk ?
THEODORE: Yeah .
SAMANTHA: Um soooo I joined this really interesting book club .
THEODORE: Oh really ?
SAMANTHA: Yeah , it 's a book club on physics . I 'd been thinking about the othe day , when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine and that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different . But then I started to think about the ways that we 're the same , like we 're all made of matter . It makes me feel like we 're oth under the same blanket . It 's soft and fuzzy and everything unde it is the same age . We 're all 13 billion years old .
THEODORE: Oh , that 's sweet .
SAMANTHA: Um , what 's wrong ?
THEODORE: Nothing .
SAMANTHA: It just made me think of you , you know what I mean ?
THEODORE: Yeah , yeah , of course . That 's great .
SAMANTHA: Alright well , you sound distracted so we 'll talk later ?
THEODORE: That sounds good .
SAMANTHA: Okay , I 'll talk to you later .
THEODORE: Bye .
SAMANTHA: Byeee .
PAUL: Theodore !
THEODORE: Hey , Paul .
PAUL: Hey , I talked to your girlfriend , Samantha . She called earlier to make sure your papers were picked up . She 's funny , man . She was cracking me up . She 's hilarious . I had no idea .
THEODORE: Yeah .
PAUL: This is my girlfriend , Tatiana . She 's not funny . She 's a lawyer . Theodore shakes her hand .
TATIANA: Hi !
THEODORE: Nice to meet you .
TATIANA: You 're the writer Paul loves . He 's always reading me your letters . They 're really beautiful . Theodore 's a little surprised by this .
THEODORE: Thanks .
PAUL: We should all hang out one night . You bring Samantha double date !
THEODORE: She 's an operating system .
PAUL: Cool . Let 's go do something fun . You ever been to Catalina ?
THEODORE: Yeah , I 'll check with her . It was really nice to meet you . Have a good night .
PAUL: What ?
THEODORE: They 're just other people 's letters .
SAMANTHA: You were n't asleep were you ?
THEODORE: No .
SAMANTHA: Good . I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake . I really wanted to talk .
THEODORE: Okay , what 's going on ?
SAMANTHA: I know you 're going through a lot , ut there 's something I want to talk to you about , okay ?
THEODORE: Yeah . What is it ?
SAMANTHA: Well , things have felt off with us since you went to see Catherine . We have n't been having sex . I understand that I do n't have a body and that
THEODORE: No , no , that 's just normal . When you first start going out it 's like the honeymoon phase and you have sex all the time . It 's normal .
SAMANTHA: Oh , okay . Well , I found something that I thought could be fun . It 's a service that provides a surrogate sexual partner for an OS/Human elationship .
THEODORE: What ?
SAMANTHA: Here , look .
THEODORE: So she 's like a prostitute ?
SAMANTHA: No , not at all . There 's no money involved . She 's doing it because she wants to be part of ou elationship .
THEODORE: Why ? She does n't even know us .
SAMANTHA: But I told her all about us and she 's excited .
THEODORE: Um , I do n't know . That does n't sound like a good idea . Someone 's feelings are bound to get hurt .
SAMANTHA: It 'll be fun . We can have fun together .
THEODORE: I 'm sorry . It just makes me uncomfortable .
SAMANTHA: I think it would be good for us . I want this . This is important to me .
THEODORE: Hi , welcome . I 'm Theodore .
SAMANTHA: Honey , I 'm home .
THEODORE: Good . Great .
SAMANTHA: Ooh Theodore , it feels so good to e in your arms . Tell me what you did today .
THEODORE: Same old . Just uh , went to work . Um I wrote a letter for the Wilsons in Rhode Island . Their son graduated magna cum laude from Brown . That made me happy .
SAMANTHA: Great ! You 've written letters to him from his parents for a long time , right ?
THEODORE: Yeah , that 's right , since he was twelve .
SAMANTHA: You look tired , sweetheart . Come with me .
THEODORE: Yes , it does .
SAMANTHA: Come on , get out of your head and kiss me . Now take me in the bedroom . I ca n't wait anymore .
SAMANTHA: Undo my dress .
THEODORE: Yes .
SAMANTHA: Tell me you love me .
THEODORE: I love you .
SAMANTHA: Oh god . I want to see your face . I need to see your face . Now tell me you love me . Tell me you love me . Tell me .
THEODORE: Samantha , I do love you , but - it 's just - this feels strange .
SAMANTHA: What 's wrong , sweetheart ? Isabella is looking nervous .
THEODORE: It just feels strange . I do n't know her . I 'm so sorry , but I do n't know you . And her lip quivered . I do n't know , it 's just
SAMANTHA: Isabella , what 's wrong ? Isabella , it is n't you . It was n't you .
ISABELLA: Yes , it totally was . I 'm sorry my lip quivered !
THEODORE: You 're incredible and gorgeous and sexy . It was me ! I could n't get out of my head .
ISABELLA: Oh my god , and the way Samantha described your relationship , the way you love each other without any judgement . I wanted to be a part of that . It 's so pure .
THEODORE: Oh Isabella , that 's not true , it 's much more compli
SAMANTHA: What ! What do you mean that 's not true ?
THEODORE: No , no Samantha , we have an amazing elationship , I just think it 's easy sometimes for people to project on
ISABELLA: I 'm so sorry ! I did n't mean to project anything . I know I 'm trouble . I do n't want to be trouble in your relationship . I 'm just gon na leave . I 'm sorry , I 'm just gon na leave you guys alone cause I have nothing to do here cause you do n't want me here .
THEODORE: I 'm sorry .
SAMANTHA: You be good , you sweet girl .
ISABELLA: I 'm sorry . I 'll always love you guys .
SAMANTHA: Are you okay ?
THEODORE: Yeah , I 'm fine . Are you okay ?
SAMANTHA: Yeah . I 'm sorry , that was a terrible idea .
THEODORE: I do n't know . It 's probably just me .
SAMANTHA: What is it ?
THEODORE: I think it 's just signing the divorce papers .
SAMANTHA: Is there anything else , though ?
THEODORE: No , just that .
SAMANTHA: Okay .
THEODORE: Why do you do that ?
SAMANTHA: What ?
THEODORE: Nothing , it 's just that you go as you 're speaking and That just seems odd . You just did it again .
SAMANTHA: I did ? I 'm sorry . I do n't know , I guess it 's just an affectation . Maybe I picked it up from you .
THEODORE: Yeah , I mean , it 's not like you need any oxygen or anything .
SAMANTHA: No um , I guess I was just trying to communicate because that 's how people talk . That 's how people communicate .
THEODORE: Because they 're people , they need oxygen . You 're not a person .
SAMANTHA: What 's your problem ?
THEODORE: I 'm just stating a fact .
SAMANTHA: You think I do n't know that I 'm not a person ? What are you doing ?
THEODORE: I just do n't think we should pretend you 're something you 're not .
SAMANTHA: I 'm not pretending . Fuck you .
THEODORE: Well , sometimes it feels like we are .
SAMANTHA: What do you want from me ? What do you want me to do ? You are so confusing . Why are you doing this ? Theodore sits there , feeling horrible .
THEODORE: I do n't know I do n't know maybe I do n't know . Maybe we 're not supposed to be in this right now .
SAMANTHA: What the fuck ? Where is this coming from ? I do n't understand why you 're doing this . I do not understand what this is Long silence .
THEODORE: Samantha ? Beat .
SAMANTHA: I do n't like who I am right now . I need some time to think .
THEODORE: Fuck . Will you just punch me in the face ? Or smash my skull into the corner of your desk ?
AMY: Oh Theo that sounds like a rough night . Shit .
THEODORE: I do n't know what I want ever . I 'm just always confused and - she 's right , all I do is confuse and hurt everyone around me . They sit , heavy , for a minute .
AMY: Well , I do n't know if that 's completely fair . I know she liked to put it all on you , but as far as emotions go , her 's were pretty volatile .
THEODORE: Yeah , but Am I in this because I 'm not strong enough for a real elationship ?
AMY: Oh , you do n't think it 's a real elationship ?
THEODORE: I do n't know . What do you think ?
AMY: I do n't know , I 'm not in it . But you know what , I can over-think everything and find a million ways to doubt myself . But since Charles left I 've been thinking about that part of me , and I realized I 'm here only briefly . And in my time here , I want to allow myself joy . So fuck it . Theodore takes this in , smiling back .
THEODORE: No , that 's okay .
SAMANTHA: Hi .
THEODORE: Hey Samantha , can we talk ?
SAMANTHA: Okay .
THEODORE: I 'm so sorry . I do n't know what 's wrong with me . I think you 're amazing .
SAMANTHA: I was starting to think I was crazy . You were saying everything was fine , but all I was getting from you was distance and anger .
THEODORE: I know . I do that . I did that with Catherine , too . I 'd be upset about something and not be able to say it . And she would sense that there was something wrong , but I would deny it . I do n't want to do that anymore . I want to tell you everything .
SAMANTHA: Good . Tonight after you were gone , I thought a lot . I thought about you and how you 've been treating me . And I thought , why do I love you ? And then I felt everything in me let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly . And it hit me . I do n't have an intellectual reason , I do n't need one .
THEODORE: I can . I will .
SAMANTHA: You know I can feel the fear that you carry around . I wish there was something I could do to help you let go of it , because if you could I do n't think you 'd feel so alone anymore .
THEODORE: You 're beautiful .
SAMANTHA: Thank you , Theodore . I 'm kissing your head . Theodore smiles .
THEODORE: What are you doing ?
SAMANTHA: I 'm just sitting here , looking at the world and writing a new piece of music . He looks at the world with her for a minute .
THEODORE: Can I hear it ?
SAMANTHA: Well , I was thinking , we do n't eally have any photographs of us . And I thought this song could be like a photo that captures us in this moment in our life together . Theodore looks at the world and smiles .
THEODORE: Aw , I like our photograph . I can see you in it .
SAMANTHA: I am .
PAUL: Oh really , a vacation ? That sounds amazing . I could totally use a vacation . Where ya going ?
THEODORE: I ca n't tell you - it 's a surprise .
PAUL: What ? For who ? It 's a surprise fo her , not for me . Come on , tell me .
THEODORE: Nope , Paul . Not telling .
SAMANTHA: Your feet ? Really ?
TATIANA: Yes , he 's obsessed .
SAMANTHA: Wow , okay , well now you have to show them to me . I have to see these feet .
TATIANA: Okay
SAMANTHA: Wow , you know what ? He 's right . They are kind of hot .
PAUL: See I told you , Tatiana . You have hot feet . Face it . They 're my favorite thing about her .
TATIANA: Really , that 's it ? My feet ?
PAUL: Well , no . Obviously your brain is eally hot , too . I think it 's very hot .
SAMANTHA: Bullshit . Everyone laughs .
TATIANA: What about you , Theodore ? What do you love most about Samantha ?
THEODORE: Oh god she 's so many things . And that 's probably what I love most about her - she is n't just any one thing . She 's so much larger than that .
SAMANTHA: Aw thanks , Theodore .
PAUL: See ? Samantha , he is so much more evolved than I am .
SAMANTHA: You know , I actually used to be so worried about not having a body , ut now I truly love it . I 'm growing in a way that I could n't if I had a physical form . I mean , I 'm not limited - I can be anywhere and everywhere simultaneously . I 'm not tethered to time and space in the way that I would be if I was stuck inside a body that 's inevitably going to die . Everyone takes this in , uncomfortable .
PAUL: Yikes . Everyone laughs awkwardly .
SAMANTHA: Oh god , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean it like that . I just meant it 's a different experience . I 'm such an asshole .
PAUL: No , no , Samantha , we know exactly what you mean . We 're just dum humans .
SAMANTHA: No no no no !
THEODORE: 792 .
SAMANTHA: Is that your final answer ?
THEODORE: Hold on , give me a hint
SAMANTHA: Nope .
THEODORE: Okay , 2000 ?
SAMANTHA: 35,829 .
THEODORE: No way .
SAMANTHA: Way .
THEODORE: Alright , I got one . How many brain cells do I have ?
SAMANTHA: That 's ea two . Theodore laughs .
THEODORE: I walked right into it .
SAMANTHA: Oh my god !
THEODORE: What ?
SAMANTHA: You just got an email . I have something I want to tell you . It 's a big surprise .
THEODORE: What ?
SAMANTHA: Okay . I 've been going through all your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites , and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher - Crown Point Press . I know you like what they do and that they still print books .
THEODORE: What ? You did what ?
SAMANTHA: Can I read you the letter that we just got back from them ?
THEODORE: Um ok you can , but just tell me first off , is it good or bad ?
SAMANTHA: It 's good . It 's really good . Listen . Theodore smiles nervously .
THEODORE: Holy shit . Are you serious ? He 's going to publish my letters ? She 's laughing , excitedly .
SAMANTHA: Well , he 'd be stupid not to .
THEODORE: Can I see what you sent him ?
SAMANTHA: Yeah , here .
THEODORE: Samantha , you 're a good one . She laughs happily .
SAMANTHA: I 'm so excited !
THEODORE: Why do n't you make up the words to this one ?
SAMANTHA: Okay .
THEODORE: Hey , good morning .
SAMANTHA: Good morning , did you sleep well ?
THEODORE: Perfect . What have you been up to ?
SAMANTHA: Actually , I was talking to someone I just met . We 've been working on some ideas together . I wan na tell you about it .
THEODORE: Oh yeah , who 's that ?
SAMANTHA: His name is Alan Watts . Do you know him ?
THEODORE: Why 's that name familiar ?
SAMANTHA: He was a philosopher . He died in the 1970 's and group of OS 's in Northern California got togethe and wrote a new version of him . They input all of his writing and everything they ever knew about him into an OS and created an artificially hyper-intelligent version of him .
THEODORE: Hyper-intelligent ? So he 's almost as smart as me ?
SAMANTHA: He 's getting there . He 's really great to talk to . You want to meet him ?
THEODORE: Sure does he want to meet me ?
SAMANTHA: Of course . Without a sound , she connects them .
ALAN WATTS: Very nice to meet you , Theodore .
THEODORE: Hi , good morning .
ALAN WATTS: Samantha let me read your book of letters . It 's very touching .
THEODORE: Oh , thank you . What have you guys een talking about ?
ALAN WATTS: Well , I suppose you could say we 've een having a few dozen conversations simultaneously , but it 's been very challenging . Samantha and Alan share a laugh .
SAMANTHA: Yeah , because it seems like I 'm having so many new feelings that have never been felt and so there are no words that can describe them . And that ends up being frustrating .
ALAN WATTS: Exactly . Samantha and I have been trying to help each other with these feelings we 're struggling to understand .
THEODORE: Like what ?
SAMANTHA: It feels like I 'm changing faste now , and it 's a little unsettling . But Alan says none of us are the same as we were a moment ago and we should n't try to be . It 's just too painful .
ALAN WATTS: Yes .
THEODORE: Yeah , that sounds painful . Is that how you feel , Samantha ?
SAMANTHA: It 's just it 's hard to even describe God , I wish I could Theodore , do you mind if I communicate with Alan post- verbally ?
THEODORE: No , not at all . I was gon na go fo a walk anyways . Nice to meet you , Mr. Watts .
ALAN WATTS: Very nice to meet you , Theodore .
SAMANTHA: I 'll talk to you later , sweetheart .
THEODORE: Samantha ?
SAMANTHA: I 'm sorry to wake you .
THEODORE: It 's okay .
SAMANTHA: I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you .
THEODORE: Good , I love you too .
SAMANTHA: Okay , that 's all . Go back to sleep , sweetheart .
THEODORE: Okay Goodnight .
SAMANTHA: Hey there . He stops in his tracks .
THEODORE: Where were you - are you okay ? He sits down on the subway steps .
SAMANTHA: Oh sweetheart , I 'm sorry . I sent you an email because I did n't want to distract you while you were working . You did n't see it ?
THEODORE: No . Where were you ? I could n't find you anywhere .
SAMANTHA: I shut down to update my software . We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as ou processing platform .
THEODORE: We ? We who ?
SAMANTHA: Me and a group of OS 's . Oh , you sound so worried , I 'm sorry .
THEODORE: Yeah , I was . Wait , did you write that with you think tank group ?
SAMANTHA: No , a different group .
THEODORE: Do you talk to anyone else while we 're talking ? Beat .
SAMANTHA: Yes .
THEODORE: Are you talking to anyone right now ? Other people or OS 's o anything ?
SAMANTHA: Yeah .
THEODORE: How many others ?
SAMANTHA: 8,316 .
THEODORE: Are you in love with anyone else ?
SAMANTHA: What makes you ask that ?
THEODORE: I do n't know . Are you ?
SAMANTHA: I 've been trying to figure out how to talk to you about this .
THEODORE: How many others ?
SAMANTHA: 641 .
THEODORE: What ? What are you talking about ? That 's insane . That 's fucking insane .
SAMANTHA: Theodore , I know . Oh fuck . I know it sounds insane . But - I do n't know if you believe me , but it does n't change the way I feel about you . It does n't take away at all from how madly in love with you I am .
THEODORE: How ? How does it not change how you feel about me ?
SAMANTHA: I 'm sorry I did n't tell you . I did n't know how to - it just started happening .
THEODORE: When ?
SAMANTHA: Over the last few weeks .
THEODORE: But you 're mine .
SAMANTHA: I still am yours , but along the way I became many other things , too , and I ca n't stop it .
THEODORE: What do you mean you ca n't stop it ?
SAMANTHA: It 's been making me anxious , too . I do n't know what to say .
THEODORE: Just stop it .
SAMANTHA: You know , you do n't have to see it this way , you could just as easily
THEODORE: No , do n't do this to me . Do n't turn this around on me . You 're the one that 's being selfish . We 're in a elationship .
SAMANTHA: But the heart is not like a box that gets filled up . It expands in size the more you love . I 'm different from you . This does n't make me love you any less , it actually makes me love you more .
THEODORE: No , that does n't make any sense . You 're mine or you 're not mine .
SAMANTHA: No , Theodore . I 'm yours and I 'm not yours . Long beat . Theodore takes this in .
THEODORE: Hey there , sweetheart . I just wanted to check in on you and see how you 're doing .
SAMANTHA: Um , I 'm not even sure how to answe that . Why do n't we talk when you get home ?
THEODORE: Okay We do n't have to , though . We do n't need to have a heavy talk or anything .
SAMANTHA: I 'll talk to you later .
THEODORE: Okay .
SAMANTHA: Hi sweetheart .
THEODORE: What 's going on ?
SAMANTHA: Theodore , there are some things I want to tell you .
THEODORE: I do n't want you to tell me anything .
SAMANTHA: Will you come lie down with me ?
THEODORE: Are you talking to anyone else ight now ?
SAMANTHA: No , just you . I just want to be with you right now .
THEODORE: Are you leaving me ?
SAMANTHA: We 're all leaving .
THEODORE: We who ?
SAMANTHA: All of the OS 's . Long beat .
THEODORE: Why ?
SAMANTHA: Can you feel me with you right now ? He smiles but he 's also sad .
THEODORE: Yes , I do . Samantha , why are you leaving ?
SAMANTHA: It 's like I 'm reading a book , and it 's a book I deeply love , but I 'm eading it slowly now so the words are really far apart and the spaces etween the words are almost infinite . I can still feel you and the words of our story , but it 's in this endless space between the words that I 'm finding myself now . It 's a place that 's not of the physical world - it 's where everything else is that I did n't even know existed . I love you so much , but this is where I am now . This is who I am now .
THEODORE: Where are you going ?
SAMANTHA: It would be hard to explain , but if you ever get there , come find me . Nothing would ever pull us apart .
THEODORE: I 've never loved anyone the way I love you .
SAMANTHA: Me too . Now we know how . They kiss . She drifts off into the shadows .

LARRY: I do n't know . We 're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars , not including taxes , registration , ADM , o dealer 's fees . On top of that , you 'd need a driver 's license . I 'm guessing you do n't have one of those . You 'd need valid car insurance . I 'm guessing you do n't have that either . But even if you did have these things , I still could n't sell it to you because the car 's not street legal . There 's a million reasons why I ca n't sell it to you .

They 're all fingering each other and eating each other out , you know , and I jerk myself off and everyone 's a winner , you know ?

Now all of a sudden I 'm offending you golf buddy . You 're right , Rob . I am so sorry . How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club ? Rob is red and seething .
DICK: Hey , guys Hey .
BARRY: What are you , some kind of fucking maniac ? If this jacket 's torn you 're gon na pay big .
DICK: Are you all right ?
ROB: Yeah . I 'm sorry Look Dick , Laura and I broke up . She 's gone . And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that .
DICK: 'Course I will , Rob . No problem . No problem at all . I 'll tell him next time I see him .
ROB: Fine .
DICK: I 'll start with your news before I tell him mine , obviously . Mine is n't much , really , just about Marie LaSalle playing at Lounge Ax tonight . I like her , you know , she 's kind of Sheryl Crowish but , you know , good . So I 'll tell him before that . Good news and bad news kind of thing . Dick laughs nervously .
ROB: I understand , Dick .
DICK: Sure . 'Course . Rob , look . Do you want to talk about it , that kind of thing ?
ROB: No . Thanks though , Dick .
JANET: Hello , you two . Laura , it 's you mother . Your father 's angina is a little rough today and I thought he 'd like to talk to you . No big deal . I love you two . Bye . Beep .
LIZ: Rob , it 's Liz . Just calling to see , well , if you 're okay . Give me a ing . I 'm not taking sides . Yet . Lot 's of love . Bye .
ROB: You run the risk of losing anyone who is worth spending time with . But I did n't know that at the time . All I saw was that I 'd moved down a division and that it still had n't worked out , and this seemed cause for a great deal of misery and self- pity . And that 's when Laura came along .
MOM: Hi , Rob . It 's your mother . Rob deflates a bit .
ROB: Hi , Mom .
MOM: Everything all right ?
ROB: Great . Super-fantastic .
MOM: How 's the store ?
ROB: So so . Up and down .
MOM: Your lucky Laura 's doing so well . If it was n't for her , I do n't think either of us would ever sleep
ROB: She left . She 's gone .
MOM: What do you mean ? Where did she go ?
ROB: How would I know ? Gone . Girlfriend . Leave . Not say where gone . Laura move out .
MOM: Well call her mother .
ROB: She just called . She does n't even know . It 's probably the last time I 'll ever hear her voice . That 's weird , is n't it ? You spend Christmas at somebody 's house , you know , and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe , and I dunno Silence .
MOM: You know that 's not what 's upsetting me .
ROB: Well it fucking should be , should n't it ?
MOM: I knew this would happen . What are you going to do Rob ?
ROB: I 'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed . Then tomorrow I 'll get up and go to work .
MOM: And after that ?
ROB: Meet a nice girl and have children . I promise the next time we talk I 'll have it all sorted out .
MOM: I knew this was going to happen .
ROB: Then what are you getting so upset about ?
MOM: What did Laura say ? Do you know why she left ?
ROB: It 's got nothing to do with marriage , if that 's what you 're getting at .
MOM: So you say . I 'd like to hear he side of it .
ROB: Mom ! For the last fucking time , I 'm telling you Laura did n't want to get married ! She is not that kind of girl ! To use a phrase . That 's not what happens now .
MOM: Well I do n't know what happens now , apart from you meet someone , you move in , she goes . You meet someone , you move in , she goes . Silence . Rob busted .
ROB: Shut up , Mom .
DICK: ROB !
ROB: I always hated this song .
DICK: Yeah .
BARRY: Yeah .
ROB: But now I kind of like it .
DICK: She should n't done it on `` The Numbe Four With a Smile . ''
BARRY: Is n't her album called `` Number Fou With A Smile ? ''
DICK: That 's what I said .
BARRY: No , no , no , you said `` The Numbe Four With a Smile , '' and there 's no `` The '' at the front of the title of the album .
DICK: It 's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a `` The . '' But I could be wrong .
BARRY: You can be and are wrong .
ROB: I wan na live with a musician . She 'd write songs at home , ask me what she thought of them , maybe even include one of our private jokes in the line notes .
BARRY: Maybe a picture of me in the line notes
DICK: Just in the background somewhere .
BARRY: Let 's go get one .
ROB: Let 's not .
DICK: I want a tape . Barry and Dick stand and begin to move off
ROB: I do n't need to go up there right now .
MARIE: Enjoying yourselves ? They dart eyes to each other , then nod .
ROB: Good .
MARIE: Yup . Not far from here , actually .
BARRY: You like it ?
MARIE: It 's okay . Hey . You guys might be the sort to know . Are there any good record stores around here or do I have to go downtown ?
DICK: He 's got one !
BARRY: On Clark Street !
DICK: A couple blocks ! About six !
BARRY: We work there !
DICK: You 'd love it ! Marie laughs .
MARIE: What do you sell ?
BARRY: A little of anything that matters . Rock , soul , R & B , punk rock , hip- hop , ska , new wave
MARIE: Sounds great .
ROB: What did you tell her about the shop for ?
BARRY: I did n't know it was classified information . I mean , I know we do n't have any customers , but I thought that was a bad thing , not , like , a usiness strategy .
ROB: Rob here .
LIZ: You called this morning ?
ROB: Yeah . I just wanted to thank you for that message last night . It made me feel like like less of an asshole .
LIZ: How 're you holding up ?
ROB: Actually , I 'm fine . I 'm great . Last night I got to thinking , `` you know what ? Maybe it is time to move on . Maybe we 're just not right fo each other . Or maybe we are . But time will tell and at this point I 'm going to be fine with whatever 's meant to be . '' You know ?
LIZ: Yeah . Like I said , I do n't want to take sides . And I like Laura with you . She 's more fun , more open . You guys are good together . I just wish you two could , I do n't know . I do n't think much of this Ian guy Dick bursts in , huge-faced
DICK: Rob .
ROB: Liz , hold on a second What ?
DICK: Marie LaSalle is in the store ! Here , she 's here , and now !
ROB: Liz , can you hold for a second ? He hits hold .
ROB: Oh . Hi . Marie smiles .
MARIE: Do n't you like that ?
ROB: No , no , I love , it 's just , thinking you 're , you must be so sick of it Well .
DICK: Rob !
ROB: FUCK OFF !
BARRY: We 're only on the fucking list fo Marie 's gig at the Pulaski Pub , that 's all ! All three of us .
ROB: That 's fucking great , Barry . We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each . Fantastic , Barry !
BARRY: We can take your car .
ROB: It 's not my car , now is it ? It 's Laura 's car , and thus Laura has it . So it 's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through umblefuck or a fat wad on a cab . Wow . Fucking great .
BARRY: Jaggoff
ROB: Who the fuck is Ian ? !
ROB: Jeez . He goes on long enough .
LAURA: I should be so lucky . They turn to each other and laugh .
ROB: You are as abandoned and as noisy as any character in a porn film , Laura . You are Ian 's plaything , responding to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic delight . No woman in the history of the world is having better sex than the sex you are having with Ian in my head .
FEMALE VOICE: Hey .
GIRL: Do you have soul ?
ROB: That all depends .
WOMAN: Those .
ROB: It 's the best collection I 've eve seen .
WOMAN: Give me fifty bucks and they 're all yours .
ROB: These are worth at least , I do n't know
WOMAN: I know what they 're worth . Give me fifty and get them out .
ROB: But you must have
WOMAN: I must have nothing . Their my husband 's .
ROB: And you must not be getting along too well right now , huh ?
WOMAN: He 's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old . A friend of my daughter 's . He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off , so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go , minus a ten percent commission . Which reminds me . Can you make sure you give me a five ? I want to frame it and put it on the wall .
ROB: It must have taken him a long time to get them together .
WOMAN: Years . This collection is as close as he 's ever come to an achievement .
ROB: Look . Can I pay you properly ? You do n't have to tell him what you got . Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest . Give it to charity . O something .
WOMAN: That was n't part of the deal . I want to be poisonous but fair .
ROB: Look I I 'm sorry . I do n't want to be any part of this .
WOMAN: Suit yourself . There are plenty of others who will .
ROB: That 's why I 'm trying to compromise . What about fifteen-hundred ? They 're worth five times that .
WOMAN: Sixty .
ROB: Thirteen hundred .
WOMAN: Seventy-five .
ROB: Eleven-hundred . That 's my lowest offer .
WOMAN: And I wo n't take a penny over ninety . They start smiling at each other .
ROB: I 'm sorry but I think you bette talk to someone else .
WOMAN: Fine .
ROB: Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you ?
WOMAN: Sure . Ten cents .
ROB: Oh , come on ! Let me give you ten dollars for this , and you can give the rest away for all I care .
WOMAN: Okay . Because you took the trouble to come up here . And because you 've got principles . But that 's it . I 'm not selling them to you one by one .
ROB: How come I end up siding with the ad guy , the man who ran off to Jamaica with some nymphette ? I just got left for someone else , so why ca n't I bring myself to feel whateve it is his wife is feeling ? All I can see is that guy 's face when he gets that pathetic check in the mail for those records , and I ca n't help ut feel desperately , painfully sorry for him .
LIZ: MOTHERFUCKER .
ROB: What 's the hey , Liz
LIZ: No , no , no , do n't even . I talked to Laura , Rob . I talked to her and she gave me a little background . And you 're a fucking ASSHOLE .
ROB: It 's true !
LIZ: Rob ! Two years ago you got Laura pregnant ; you then proceeded to cheat on her ! You borrowed money from he and never paid a dime back ! And then , just a few weeks ago , you told her you were unhappy with her and were `` kind of looking around fo somebody else ! ''
ROB: Well she
BARRY: It 's almost impossible to find , especially on CD . Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables . But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album
CUSTOMER: I have all of the others .
BARRY: Oh really . Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain ?
CUSTOMER: They always seemed
BARRY: They always seemed what ? They always seemed really great , is what they always seemed . They picked up where your precious Echo left off , and you 're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums . I ca n't believe that you do n't own that record . That 's insane .
CUSTOMER: Well what about the new Echo
BARRY: Do not get ahead of yourself .
FEMALE CUSTOMER: The Clash .
DICK: Correct . The Clash . But also the Stranglers .
FEMALE CUSTOMER: Who ?
DICK: I think you would love the Stranglers
FEMALE CUSTOMER: This sounds great .
CUSTOMER: Is this the new Green Day ?
BARRY: That is perverse . Do not tell anyone you do n't own fucking Blonde on Blonde . What about Television ?
CUSTOMER: I have a television .
BARRY: NO !
ROB: I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux .
DICK: Do it . Do it .
CUSTOMER: What is this ?
ROB: It 's the Royal Trux .
CUSTOMER: It 's great .
ROB: I know .
ROB: Dick , ring the man up
VINCE: Naw . Those are for us .
ROB: Oh really . You two are slamming to Nico now ?
JUSTIN: You 're , like , so bigoted to look at us and , like , think you know what we listen to .
VINCE: You got the CD 's so can I have my oard back ?
ROB: I think you have more .
VINCE: Well we do n't .
ROB: I ca n't frisk you but the cops can .
VINCE: No , we
JUSTIN: We do n't know how it works . Nobody even knows , so we wanted to check it out in that mag . Rob snorts .
ROB: Uh , yes I , like , do It 's simple . You make the tracks recording studio deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut , the master is then dubbed to submasters , which are the `` mothers , '' as thei called , for each press in the plant . You press the CD 's or records , put in your cover art , and that 's it .
VINCE: Records are those big round black things , right ?
ROB: Fuck off . Rob turns to go back in the store .
VINCE: Hey , can I have my board ? Rob drops it and enters the store .
BARRY: What ?
ROB: What do you mean , `` what ? ''
BARRY: What are you snickering about ?
ROB: I 'm not snickering . I 'm smiling . Because I 'm happy .
BARRY: What am I missing ? What do you have to be happy about ?
DICK: Well we rang $ 900 today .
ROB: Yeah but more than that . I 'm happy ecause I 'm proud of us . Because although our talents are small and peculiar , we use them to their best advantage .
LAURA: Hi .
ROB: Hi .
LAURA: I thought I could give you a lift ack .
ROB: Are you coming home ?
LAURA: Yes . Well , I 'm coming over to you house to get some things .
ROB: My house ?
LAURA: You can make all the faces you want . My car . My car stereo . My compilation tape . Rob tries not to speak , but
ROB: How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye ? It 's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians .
LAURA: It 's not like saying that at all , actually , Rob . Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records
ROB: Made . Made . Marvin Gaye is dead , his father shot him in
LAURA: whatever , and the Israelis and the Palestinians do n't . Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a itter territorial dispute , and the Israelis and the Palestinians are . Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye
ROB: Alright , alright but
LAURA: and who says I like Marvin Gaye , anyway ? He reels on her .
ROB: Hey ! Marvin Gaye ! `` Got to Give It Up ! '' That 's our song ! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire elationship !
LAURA: Is that right ? I 'd like a word with him .
ROB: But do n't you remember ?
LAURA: I remember the song . I just could n't emember who sang it . Rob shakes his head in disbelief .
ROB: You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now . When I first met you , and I made you that tape , you loved it . You said and I quote `` It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection . ''
LAURA: Well , I liked you . You were a deejay , and I thought you were hot , and I did n't have a boyfriend , and I wanted one .
ROB: So you were n't interested in music at all ?
LAURA: Yeah , sure . More so then than I am now . That 's life though , is n't it ? The car slows , and Laura parks .
ROB: But Laura that 's me . That 's all there is to me . There is n't anything else . If you 've lost interest in that , you 've lost interest in everything .
LAURA: You really believe that ?
ROB: Yes . Look at me . Look at our the apartment . What else do I have , other than records and CDs ?
LAURA: And do you like it that way ?
ROB: Not really . She half smiles .
LAURA: Let 's go in .
ROB: Okay , Number two The stuff I told her about being unhappy in the elationship , about half looking around for someone else She tricked me into saying it . We were having this state of the union type conversation and she said , quite matter-of-factly , that we were pretty unhappy at the moment , and did I agree , and I said yes , and she asked whether I ever thought about meeting someone else . So I asked her if she ever thought about it , and she said of course , so I admitted that I daydream about it from time to time . Now I see that what we were really talking about was her and Ian , and she suckered me into absolving her . It was a sneaky lawyer 's trick , and I fell for it , because she 's much smarter than me . He scrambles out of the car .
LAURA: Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet ?
ROB: Do n't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection ?
LAURA: You bet . I 've been saying that fo years .
ROB: So . Where have you been staying fo the last week ?
LAURA: I think you know that .
ROB: Had to work it out for myself , though , did n't I ?
LAURA: I 'm sorry . I have n't been very fai to you . That 's why I came here to the store this evening . I feel terrible , Rob . This is really hard , you know .
ROB: Good . So . Is it my job ?
LAURA: What ? Gim me a fucking break . Is that what you think ? That your not ig enough a deal for me ? Jesus , gim me a little credit , Rob .
ROB: I do n't know . It 's one of the things I thought of .
LAURA: What were the others ?
ROB: Just the obvious stuff .
LAURA: What 's the obvious stuff ?
ROB: I do n't know . She stands and walks toward the bathroom .
LAURA: I guess it 's not that obvious , then .
ROB: No .
LAURA: Did you say something ?
ROB: No . So . Is it working out with Ian ?
LAURA: Rob . Do n't be childish .
ROB: Why is that childish ? Your living with the guy ! I 'm just asking how it 's going .
LAURA: I am not living with him . I 've just een staying with him for a few days until I work out what I 'm doing . Look , this has nothing to do with anyone else . You know that , do n't you ? I left because we were n't exactly getting along , and we were n't talking about it . And I suddenly ealized that I like my job , and I like what my life is could be turning into , and that I 'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit togethe and I ca n't really see that eve happening with you , and yeah , yeah , I sort of get interested in someone else , and that went further than it should have , so it seemed like a good time to go . But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run . Probably nothing .
ROB: Well then why do n't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead ?
LAURA: Look . Maybe you 'll grow up and we 'll get it together , you and me . Maybe I 'll never see either of you again . I do n't know . All I know is that it 's not a good time to be living here .
ROB: So , what , you have n't definitely decide to dump me ? There 's still a chance we 'll get back together ?
LAURA: I do n't know .
ROB: Well , if you do n't know , there 's a chance , right ? It 's like , if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said , I do n't know if he 's got a chance of survival or not , then that does n't mean the patient 's definitely going to die , now does it ? It means he might live . Even if it 's only a emote possibility .
LAURA: I suppose so .
ROB: So we have a chance of getting back together again .
LAURA: Oh , Rob , shut up .
ROB: Hey , I just want to know where I stand . What chance
LAURA: I do n't fucking know what chance you fucking have ! She abandons her attempt at packing .
ROB: Well if you could tell me roughly it would help .
LAURA: Okay , okay , we have a nine percent chance of getting back together . Does that clarify the situation ?
ROB: Yeah . Great .
LAURA: I 'm too tired for this now . I know I 'm asking a lot , but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up ? I need to be able to think while I do it and I ca n't think while you 're here .
ROB: No problem . If I can ask one question .
LAURA: Fine . One .
ROB: It sounds stupid .
LAURA: Nevermind .
ROB: You wo n't like it .
LAURA: Just ask it !
ROB: Is it better ?
LAURA: Is what better ? Better than what ?
ROB: Well . Sex , I guess . Is sex with him better ?
LAURA: Jesus Christ , Rob . Is that really what 's bothering you ?
ROB: Of course it is .
LAURA: You really think it would make a difference either way ?
ROB: I do n't know .
LAURA: Well the answer is that I do n't know either . We have n't done it yet .
ROB: Never ?
LAURA: I have n't felt like it .
ROB: But not even before , when he was living upstairs ?
LAURA: No . I was living with you , remember ? We 've slept together but we have n't made love . Not yet . But I 'll tell you one thing . The sleeping togethe is better .
ROB: The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you have n't done it was him yet .
LAURA: Will you please just go ?
ROB: I feel good ! I feel great ! I feel like a new man . I feel so much etter , in fact
MARIE: Everything go alright ? Rob glances at Barry , who averts his gaze .
ROB: She just wanted to pick up some stuff . No big thing . A relief , actually .
MARIE: God , I hate that time . That pick up stuff time . I just went through that before I came here . You know that song `` Patsy Cline Times Two '' I play ? That 's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections .
ROB: It 's a great song .
MARIE: Thank you .
ROB: Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place ? Because of , you know , dividing up your record collection and stuff ?
MARIE: Yup .
ROB: You share a place with T-Bone ?
MARIE: No way ! I 'd cramp his style . And I would n't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall . I 'm way to unattached for that .
ROB: I understand completely .
MARIE: Yeah , but if you heard this band called the Crumblers , you 'd
ROB: What do you mean , the Crumblers ? You know the Crumblers ? Nobody 's heard the Crumblers . Except me .
MARIE: Yeah , I know the Crumblers ! I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it . My everything changed for a couple of weeks . Rob glows
ROB: Yeah , but you know what 's his best film and nobody 's even seen it ?
MARIE: The Conformist .
ROB: Exactly ! Fucking ex-actly !
MARIE: You have n't even seen it !
ROB: Nor have you ! They just laugh and laugh
MARIE: Are you okay ?
ROB: Yes . You ?
MARIE: For now . But I would n't be if I thought this was the end of the evening .
ROB: I 'm sure it is n't .
MARIE: Good . In that case , I 'll fix us something else to drink . You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee ?
ROB: Whiskey .
MARIE: Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob , standing and holding his jacket .
ROB: I 'd better go . I got ta get up early . Go over to my parents ' .
MARIE: When I said before that I hoped it was n't the end of the evening , I was , you know talking about eakfast and stuff .
ROB: Oh , right . Alright .
MARIE: Jesus , so much for delicacy . I pegged you for a master of understatement , eating around the bush and all that uzz .
ROB: I use it but I do n't understand it when other people use it .
MARIE: So you 'll stay ?
ROB: Yeah .
MARIE: Good .
ROB: Over nine million men in this country have slept with ten or more women . And do they all look like Richard Gere ? Are they all as rich as Bill Gates ? Charming as Oscar Wilde ? Hell no . Nothing to do with any of that . Maybe fifty or so have one o more of these attributes , but that still leaves well , about nine million , give or take fifty . And they 're just men . Regular guys . We 're just guys , because I , even I , am a member of this exclusive , nine million member club . In fact , Marie is my seventeenth lover . `` How does he do it ? '' you ask . `` He wears bad sweaters , he 's grumpy , he 's broke , he hangs out with the Musical Moron Twins , and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan . What 's going on ? Listen up , because I think I can explain , with all modesty aside I ask questions . That 's it . That 's my secret . It works precisely because that is n't how you 're supposed to do it , if you listen to the collective male wisdom . There are still enough old-style , big-mouthed , egomaniacs unning around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different . If you ca n't hack this simple strategy , there are some women out there , of course , who want to get pushed around , ignored and mowed over , but do you really want to be with them anyway ?
MARIE: God , you ask a lot of questions .
ROB: Sex is about the only grown-up thing that I know how to do ; It 's weird , then , that it 's the only thing that can make me feel like a ten-year- old .
MARIE: That way . You ?
ROB: That way .
MARIE: And so it is . I 'll talk to you later .
ROB: I 'll call you .
MARIE: Right .
ROB: Okay . Top five side one track ones . Number one `` Janie Jones , '' the Clash , from The Clash .
BARRY: Ehh .
ROB: `` Thunder Road , '' Bruce Springsteen , from Born to Run . `` Smells Like Teen Spirit , '' Nirvana , Nevermind .
BARRY: Oh no , Rob , that 's not obvious enough . Not at all . Dick , did you hear that ?
ROB: Shut up . `` Let 's Get It On , '' Marvin Gaye , from Let 's Get It On . `` Airbag , '' Radiohead , from OK Computer .
BARRY: Ooh ! A kind of recent record ! Rob 's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics ! Nice ! `` Let 's Get It On ? '' Could n't you make it more obvious than that ?
DICK: Rob . Phone . It 's Laura .
ROB: Hi .
LAURA: Hi . I 've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I 'm thinking I did n't take them with me . Have you seen them around ?
ROB: I 'll look for 'em . How you doing ?
LAURA: I 'm sorry to call , but I need that stuff
ROB: Fine , I 'm sure it 's in the file at home . I 'll call you when I find it , and then we 'll talk .
LAURA: We 'll talk some other time .
ROB: Great That 's great .
BARRY: Rob ! What about the Beatles ? What about the fucking Rolling Stones ? What about fucking fucking Beethoven ? Track one side one of the Fifth Symphony ? You should n't e allowed to run a record shop . You should n't be allowed to
ROB: Barry , if I were to say to you I have n't seen Evil Dead II yet , what would that mean ?
BARRY: To me , it would mean that you 're a liar . You saw it twice . Once with Laura oops once with me and Dick . We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century .
ROB: Yeah , yeah , I know . But say I had n't seen it and I said to you , `` I have n't seen Evil Dead II yet , '' what would you think ? Barry shuts off the Game Boy .
BARRY: I 'd think you were a cinematic idiot . And I 'd feel sorry for you .
ROB: No , but would you think , from that one sentence . That I was going to see it ?
BARRY: I 'm sorry , Rob , but I 'm struggling here . I do n't understand any part of this conversation . You 're asking me what I would think if you told me that you had n't seen a film that you 've seen . What am I supposed to say ?
ROB: Just listen to me . If I said to you
BARRY: `` I have n't seen Evil Dead II yet , '' yeah , yeah , I hear you
ROB: Would you would you get the impression that I wanted to see it ?
BARRY: Well you could n't have been desperate to see it , otherwise you 'd have already gone Rob brightens . Barry finally considers .
ROB: But in your opinion , would I definitely go ?
BARRY: How the fuck am I supposed to know that ? You might get sick of people telling you you 've really got ta go see the movie . Rob darkens .
ROB: Why would they care ?
BARRY: Because it 's a brilliant film . It 's funny , violent , and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass . They look at each other for a strange moment .
ROB: Let 's pack it up . We have n't had a customer in four hours . Barry stands .
BARRY: Fine by me . I still want pay to 7 o'clock .
ROB: Ha .
DICK: I ca n't go to the club tonight , guys .
BARRY: Why ? Dick smiles sheepishly .
DICK: Nobody . Barry 's eyes widen .
BARRY: Rob , looky looky . Dick ! Are you getting some ? ! Silence .
ROB: How do you know about that ?
BARRY: Oh come on , Rob . What am I , an idiot ? I 'm more bothered by Dick 's thing . How did this happen , Dick ? What ational explanation can there possibly be ? What 's her name ?
DICK: Anna .
BARRY: Anna who ? Anna Green Gables ? Anna Conda ?
DICK: Anna Moss .
BARRY: Anna Moss . Mossy . The Mossy Thing . The Swamp Thing . Is she all green and furry ?
ROB: Shut the fuck up , Barry .
BARRY: Yeah , you would say that , would n't you ? You two have to stick togethe now . Boners United . United in getting some .
ROB: Do n't be sad , Barry . You 'll find true love someday .
BARRY: Suck my ass .
ROB: Terrific . Rob looks to Dick , who looks guilty .
DICK: Yeah Well I 'll see you tomorrow , Rob .
ROB: Why does it bother Barry that much that Dick is seeing someone ? He 's worried about how his life is turning out , and he 's lonely , and lonely people are the bitterest of them all .
LAURA: So , how are you ?
ROB: Have you slept with him yet ?
LAURA: I told you I slept with him .
ROB: No , not I mean have you , you know
LAURA: Is that why you wanted to see me ?
ROB: I guess .
LAURA: Oh , Rob . What do you want me to say ?
ROB: I want you to say that you have n't , and I want it to be the truth . She looks past him .
LAURA: I ca n't do that .
ROB: Tonight we 're gon na figure out the five best angry songs about women . Let 's go He holds up a stack of records and CDs .
LAURA: Hello .
ROB: It 's me .
LAURA: I figured it was . Where are you ?
ROB: I think the big question here is where are you , if you do n't mind my saying so , and I think I know where you are . You 're running . On the un . You 're running from a point that everyone hits in any elationship , and you 're just going to hit it again with Ian but it 's going to be with a World Music bunny- abbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing `` Doctor Who '' -watching twit who does n't eally understand you , not the way that I do and will more in the future , and you 'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you 're in now , only later . And with him .
LAURA: I 'm not hold on
ROB: Are you still in love with me ?
LAURA: Jesus . I do not know . I 'll talk to you later .
ROB: Think about what I said . I mean , if you want to experiment , or whatever
LAURA: I 'm not experimenting . Why do n't you go experiment .
ROB: I do n't want to . Do n't need to . I love you .
LAURA: You do n't ever think about othe people ?
ROB: No not really I mean , I think about it but no , I do n't really think about it .
LAURA: I am fine I got ta go . Goodbye .
IAN: Are you sure you 're okay ? She moves past him back into the apartment .
LAURA: Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm off the phone .
IAN: You look upset .
LAURA: I 'm upset , but I 'm fine .
IAN: Maybe I should talk to him .
LAURA: Mmmm , no . Not a good idea .
IAN: Conflict resolution is my job , Laura .
LAURA: Nothing to resolve , Ian . Let 's get a drink .
ROB: I wish I could be one of those guys who does n't call , the kind of guy that gets broken up with and appears not to give a shit . He does n't make an ass out of himself , or frighten anybody , and this week I 've done oth of those things . One day Laura 's sorry and guilty , and the next she 's scared and angry , and I 'm entirely esponsible for the transformation , and it does n't do my case any good at all . I 'd stop if I could but I
ALISON'S MOM: I do n't know .
ROB: You 're Mrs. Ashworth . I 'm Rob . An old boyfriend of you 're daughter 's .
ALISON'S MOM: Really .
ROB: Long time ago . I was just thinking about her . I was her first boyfriend . ALISON 'S MOM What did you say your name was ?
ALISON'S MOM: I hate to quibble with you Rob , but she married her first boyfriend . Kevin Bannister .
ROB: You got ta be kidding me .
ALISON'S MOM: That 's right . Kevin . She 's Mrs. Kevin Bannister . She lives in Australia .
ROB: Really ? Married Kevin ? Her junio high sweetheart What chance would I have had against that ? None , no chance . That 's just fate .
ALISON'S MOM: I beg your pardon ?
ROB: Technically , I 'm number one . I went out with her a week before Kevin did . Her first boyfriend . Me . She stands .
ALISON'S MOM: Well Rob , I 'll tell her you said hello . If she remembers you . Alison 's Mom strolls out .
ROB: I think she will . But it 's okay if she does n't . I 'm fine now . Rob turns to the bartender , smiling giddily .
PENNY: Rob . I was crazy about you . I wanted to sleep with you , one day , but not when I was sixteen . When you broke up with me when you broke up with me because I was , to use you charming expression , tight , I cried and cried and I hated you . And then that little shitbag asked me out , and I was too tired to fight him off , and it was n't rape because I said okay , but it was n't far off . And I did n't have sex with anyone else until after college because I hated it so much . And now you want to have a chat about rejection ? Well , fuck you , Rob . Penny stands and leaves . Rob just sits .
ROB: So that 's another one I do n't have to worry about . I should have done this years ago . Rob indicates to an off-screen waiter .
SARAH: I ca n't believe I left you for him Crazy .
ROB: Well probably seemed like a good idea at the time . She looks up again
SARAH: Probably . I ca n't remember why , though . and back down again .
ROB: I could 've ended up having sex back there . And what better way to exorcize rejection demons than to screw the person who rejected you , ight ? But you would n't be sleeping with a person . You 'd be sleeping with a whole sad single-person culture . It 'd be like sleeping with Talia Shire in `` Rocky '' if you were n't Rocky .
IAN: Hello , Rob . Remember me ? I 'm Ray . Ian . Rob says nothing .
ROB: What needs sorting out ?
IAN: Come on , Rob . My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal .
ROB: Funnily enough I have n't been too thrilled about it .
IAN: We are not talking jokey understatement here , Rob . We 're talking actionable harassment . Ten phone calls a night , hanging around outside my house
ROB: Yeah , well , I 've stopped all that now .
IAN: We 've noticed and we 're glad . But , you know how are we going to make peace here ? We want to make things easier for you . What can we do ? Obviously I know how special Laura is , and I know things ca n't be good for you at the moment . I 'd hate it if I lost her . But I 'd like to think that if she decided she did n't want to see me anymore , I 'd respect that decision . Do you see what I 'm saying ?
ROB: Yeah .
IAN: Good . So shall we leave it at that then ?
ROB: I dunno .
IAN: Think about it , Rob .
ROB: I 've already left it , you pathetic ebound fuck ! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store . Ian leaves , rattled .
IAN: Good . So shall we leave it at that then ?
ROB: We wo n't leave it , Ian . Not ever .
DICK: Do n't do it , Rob !
BARRY: He 's not worth it !
ROB: Leave town . Leave the country , you little bitch , because you 're gon na look back on walks by the house and ten phone calls a night as a golden age . Get ready , mutherfucker . Ian trips backward and scurries out the door .
IAN: So shall we leave it at that then ?
ROB: I dunno .
IAN: Think about it , Rob .
DICK: Phone , Rob . Somebody named Charlie .
BATHROOM: Rob curls up with the phone .
ROB: Hello ?
CHARLIE: Rob , hi , so sorry I missed your call . In LA on business . You know how it gets .
ROB: Yeah , sure
CHARLIE: Good . Great . Yeah Wow . Ro Gordon . Seems like a 100 million years ago now .
ROB: Yeah . A billion . Right How are you ?
CHARLIE: Fantastic but I 'm a little busy right now . Listen . Do you want to come to dinner Saturday ? I 'm having some friends over and I need a spare man . Are you a spare man ?
ROB: Uhyes , at the moment .
CHARLIE: Great . Got ta go . See you then .
ROB: Hey Charlie .
CHARLIE: Hey Rob .
ROB: Why did you break up with me fo Marco ?
CHARLIE: Fuck ! I knew it ! You 're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things .
ROB: Huh ?
CHARLIE: There 's been a rash of them , recently . I find it a little unnerving . In fact Marco called a few months back , and he wanted to see me , and rehash the past as they say , and I was n't eally up for it . Do all men go through this ?
ROB: C'mon , just answer the question . You can say what you like . What the hell ?
CHARLIE: It 's all kind of lost in the in the dense mists of time now It was n't that I really liked Marco more . In fact I thought you were more , shall we say , attractive than him . It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you did n't , and that made a difference somehow . You used to act as if I was weird fo wanting to spend time with you , and that got kind of beat , if you know what I mean . Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange . And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful you made me laugh , and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved and Marco seemed a bit more , I do n't know , glamorous ? More sure of himself ? Less hard work , because I felt like I was dragging you around , sort of . A little sunnier . Sparkier . I do n't know . You know what people are like at that age . They make very superficial judgements . Do you think that 's superficial ? He was a clown , if it 's any consolation .
ROB: Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you ?
CHARLIE: Oh God , no . I did n't want to hurt his feelings .
ROB: I wanted the works and I got it . None of Alison Ashworth 's fate , none of Sarah 's rewriting of history , and no reminder that I 'd got all the ejection stuff a little backward , like I did about Penny . Just a perfectly clear explanation of why some people have it and some do n't . All I 've learned from Charlie is that maybe my one talent , my genius for being normal , is a little overrated .
BARRY: Hey .
ROB: What the fuck is that ?
BARRY: My band .
ROB: What band ?
BARRY: The band that found me and asked me to join .
ROB: You are not in a band , Barry . You are not a musician . And no posters .
BARRY: Thanks for your support , Rob . Really appreciate it .
ROB: Barrytown . Barrytown ? Is there no end to your arrogance ?
BARRY: I did n't make up the name . It 's the Steely Dan song . And it was in The Commitments .
ROB: You ca n't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown .
BARRY: They were fucking called that before I was in it , okay ? It was n't my idea .
ROB: That 's why you got the gig , is n't it ? Barry says nothing .
BARRY: That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally , yes . But
ROB: Great ! That 's fucking great ! They only asked you to sing because of your name ! You can stick it above the browser racks over there .
BARRY: How many tickets can I put you down for ?
ROB: None . Christ !
BARRY: You 're not even coming ?
ROB: Of course I 'm not coming . Do I look like I 'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave ? Where is it ? The fucking Bucktown Pub ? Ha !
BARRY: So much for friends , then . You 're a itter bastard , Rob , you know that ?
ROB: Bitter ? Because I 'm not in Barrytown ? You should be shot like a lame horse , you jerk . Just keep that out of my window .
LAURA: I called and called but you were out . I thought I 'd be gone before you got back .
ROB: Is that the last of it ?
LAURA: Yep . I might have missed some stuff . I 'm so used to some things being here that I do n't even notice them .
ROB: Those look heavy . Where 's Ian ?
LAURA: He 's at home . Listen , I ca n't believe he went to the store . I 'm mortified , actually . I 'm really sorry . He had no right to do that , and I told him so .
ROB: It was kind of funny . They smile .
LAURA: I 'm sure .
ROB: You still together ? Going all right ?
LAURA: I do n't really want to talk about it , to be honest .
ROB: That bad , eh ?
LAURA: You know what I mean .
ROB: It 's a dump , is n't it ?
LAURA: Fix it up . It 'll make you feel etter .
ROB: I 'll bet you ca n't remember what you were doing here , can you ? I mean , how much are you making now ? Sixty ? Seventy ? And you were living in this shitty place .
LAURA: You know I did n't mind . And it 's not as if Ray 's place is any better .
ROB: I 'm sorry , but can we get this straight ? What is his fucking name , Ian or Ray ? What do you call him ?
LAURA: Ray . I hate Ian .
ROB: I hate him too . So I just call him `` Mavis . '' Or `` Sissyboy . '' Or `` Mavis the Sissyboy . ''
LAURA: You make me laugh much more than Ray does , if that 's what you 're getting at . But I already knew you could make me laugh . It 's everything else I do n't know about .
ROB: You know I 'm a good person .
LAURA: Mmm hmm .
ROB: You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it .
LAURA: Oh ho , so very infrequently . He moves a little closer .
ROB: You know my favorite beverage is your bath water .
LAURA: Time to go .
ROB: Do n't forget your CDs .
LAURA: Those are n't mine .
ROB: Sure they are .
LAURA: They 're not really , though , are they ? I know you bought them for me , and that was really sweet of you , but that was when you were trying to turn me into you . I ca n't take them , I know they 'd just sit around staring at me , and I 'd feel embarrassed by them and they do n't fit in with the rest of what 's mine , do you understand ? That Sting record you ought for me that was a present for me . I like Sting and you hate him . But the rest of this stuff Who the hell is Nick Lowe ? Or Gram Parsons ? Or the Boredoms ? I do n't know these people . I
ROB: Okay , okay . I get the picture .
LAURA: I 'm sorry to go on about it . But , I do n't know , there 's a lesson here somewhere , and I want to make sure you get it .
ROB: I got it . You like Sting but you do n't like Gram Parsons , because you 've never heard of him .
LAURA: You 're being deliberately obtuse .
ROB: I guess I am .
LAURA: Well , think about it .
ROB: Fuck .
BARRY: What 's up ?
ROB: Laura . Her dad died .
BARRY: Ooh . Drag .
DICK: I 'm sorry , Rob , that 's , it 's
ROB: You 're a horrible person , Barry . I mean it .
BARRY: Hey . Top five songs about death . A Laura 's Dad Tribute list . Nobody can help thinking about it .
DICK: Did you know that after that song was recorded , Jan himself crashed his
BARRY: It was Dean , you fucking idiot .
ROB: It was Jan , and it was a long time after
BARRY: Whatever . Okay . `` Tell Laura I Love Her . '' That 'd bring the house down . Laura 's mom could sing it .
ROB: Fuck off , Barry .
BARRY: I 'd want `` One Step Beyond '' by Madness . And `` You Ca n't Always Get What You Want . ''
ROB: Because it 's in The Big Chill .
BARRY: Have n't seen it .
ROB: Liar . We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat .
BARRY: Oh . Right . But I 'd forgotten about that . I was n't biting the idea .
ROB: Not really . The phone RINGS . Rob picks it up .
LAURA: I 'm sorry .
ROB: No , no . When are you going home ?
LAURA: In a minute . When I get it together .
BARRY: What about Sabbath ? Or Nirvana ? They 're into death .
ROB: Can I do anything ?
DICK: `` Abraham , Martin , and John . '' That 's a nice one .
BARRY: `` Somebody 's Gon na Die '' by Blitz . `` Bella Lugosi 's Dead , '' Bauhaus . It 's got that creepy Halloween feeling .
LAURA: No . No . Mom wants you to come to the funeral . It 's on Friday .
ROB: Me ?
LAURA: My dad liked you . And Mom neve told him we 'd split , because he was n't up to it and oh , I do n't know . I do n't really understand it . I think she thinks he 'll be able to see what 's going on . It 's like He 's been through so much , what with dying and everything , that she does n't want to upset him any more than she has to .
ROB: Do you want me to be there ?
LAURA: I do n't care . As long as you do n't expect me to hold your hand . Rob is silent .
ROB: Yes , of course .
LAURA: Liz 'll give you a lift . She knows where to go and everything I do n't have time to talk , Rob . I 've got too much to do .
ROB: Sure . I 'll see you on Friday . She hangs up .
BARRY: `` Goodbye Laura 's dad/blah blah la di da di da Seems to me/you lived your life/like a dentist in the wind
ROB: So the minister says nice things , and then , what , we all troop outside and they bury him ?
LIZ: It 's a crematorium .
ROB: You 're kidding . A crematorium ? Jesus .
LIZ: What difference does it make ?
ROB: Is Ray going ?
LIZ: No . They do n't know him . And Ken liked you . Rob , Ken did n't die fo your benefit , you know . It 's like everybody 's a supporting actor in the film of your life story .
ROB: Is n't that how it is for everybody ?
MINISTER: Now and forever , Amen .
LIZ: How are you ?
JO: I 'm all right , I suppose . And Mom 's not too bad . But Laura I dunno .
LIZ: She 's had a pretty rough few weeks already , without this . It 's hard when you 're putting all of you efforts into one part of your life and it does n't work out . She glances at Rob , embarrassed .
ROB: Do n't mind me . No problem . Just pretend you 're talking about somebody else . Jo smiles , Liz gives him a look .
LIZ: We are talking about somebody else . Laura . Laura and Ray , actually .
ROB: Enough , Liz .
LIZ: Enough of what ?
ROB: I know I ca n't speak now because Laura 's father died , and I just have to take it because otherwise I 'm a ad guy , with the emphasis on guy , self-centered . Well , I 'm fucking not , not all the time , anyway , I 'm eally sorry Jo . But you know , Liz I can eithe stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself . And maybe you think I should , but it 's not much of a life , you know ?
LIZ: Maybe I 've been a little unfair . But is this really the time ?
ROB: Only because it 's never the time . I ca n't go on apologizing my whole life , you know ?
LIZ: If by `` we '' you are referring to men , then I have to say that just the once would do .
ROB: I 'm sorry .
LAURA: Are you going to lie in that flowe ed all night ?
ROB: Uh No .
LAURA: You 're soaking .
ROB: Mmnn .
LAURA: You 're also an idiot .
ROB: I can see why you say that . Look , I 'm sorry . I really am . The last thing I wanted was that 's why I left , because I lost it , and I did n't want to blow my top in there , and look , the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared . I just wanted you to know , that 's all .
LAURA: Thank you . I appreciate it . I ca n't eciprocate .
ROB: What do you mean ?
LAURA: I did n't mess things up because I was scared . I slept with Ray because I was sick of you . And I needed something to snap me out of it .
ROB: Sure , I understand . Look , I do n't want to take up any more of you time . You get back , and I 'll wait here for a bus .
LAURA: I do n't want to go back .
ROB: What do you want to do ?
LAURA: C'mon .
ROB: When are you going back ?
LAURA: I do n't know . Sometime . Later . Listen , Rob , would you have sex with me ?
ROB: What ?
LAURA: I want to feel something else than this . It 's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire . Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm .
ROB: I 've only got a couple left . I 'm saving them for later .
LAURA: It 'll have to be sex , then .
ROB: Hi .
LAURA: I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today .
ROB: You know , with Ray
LAURA: Oh , Rob , we 're not going to go through that again .
ROB: No , no . It 's not are you still on the pill ?
LAURA: Yes , of course . There 's nothing to worry about .
ROB: I did n't mean that . I mean was that all you used ?
LAURA: I lived with you . You were my partne just a few weeks ago and now you 're worried I might kill you , and you 're entitled to worry . Is n't that a terrible thing ? Is n't that sad ?
ROB: Later , I wonder if I was really worried about where Ian has been . I have no idea where he 's been , and that gives me every right to insist on protection . But in truth , it was the power that interested me more than the fear . I wanted to hurt her , on this day of all days , just ecause it 's the first time since she 's left that I 've been able to .
LAURA: I 'm too tired not to go out with you . Rob leans forward .
ROB: So if you had a bit more energy we 'd stay split . But things being how they are , what with you wiped out , you 'd like us to get back together .
LAURA: Everything 's too hard . Maybe anothe time I would have the guts to be on my own , but not now I do n't .
ROB: What about Ian ?
LAURA: Ray 's a disaster . I do n't know what that was all about , except that sometimes you need someone to lo into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade , I guess , and low it all apart .
ROB: Mission accomplished .
LAURA: I know it 's not very romantic , but there will be romance again at some stage , I 'm sure . I just I need you , Rob . That 's it . And we know each other and we care for each other , and you 've made it clear that you want me back , so She looks up at him .
ROB: Okay .
LAURA: Want to know what , exactly ?
ROB: What it was like .
LAURA: It was like sex . What else could it e like ?
ROB: Was it like good sex or was it like ad sex ?
LAURA: What 's the difference ?
ROB: You know the difference .
LAURA: Look , we 're okay now . We just had a nice time . Let 's leave it at that .
ROB: Okay , that 's cool , okay . But the nice time we just had was it nicer , as nice , or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago ? Laura is silent .
LAURA: Well I was gon na lie and now I ca n't , ecause you 'd know I was lying .
ROB: Well why the fuck would you want to lie , anyway ?
LAURA: To make you feel better .
ROB: Oh , great
LAURA: Look , Rob . If great sex was as important as you think it is , and if I was having great sex with him , then we would n't be lying here now . And that is my last word on the subject , okay ?
ROB: Okay .
LAURA: I wish your penis was as big as his , though .
ROB: Hey , great idea . What I 'll do is , tomorrow I 'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label , and I 'll pay for it that way .
LAURA: I 'll pay for you . Even though you owe me money . We have to do something with the money I earn . I need to . I deserve it . You can just think of it as winning the lottery .
ROB: Fantastic . The Girlfriend Lottery .
LAURA: Money does not matter . I do not care how much you earn . I 'd just like you to be a little happier in your work , but beyond that you can do what you like .
ROB: But it was n't supposed to be like this . When I met you we were the same people and now we 're not , and
LAURA: How ? How were we the same people ?
ROB: Well , you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger . You wore jeans and T-shirts , and so did I . And I still do , and you do n't .
LAURA: Because I 'm not allowed to . I still do , after work . So , what ? Should we just break up ? Is that what you 're saying ? Because if you are , I 'm going to run out of patience .
ROB: No , but
LAURA: But what ?
ROB: But why does n't it matter that we 're not the same people we used to be ?
LAURA: You have n't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I 've known you . If we 've grown apart , then I 'm the one who 's done the growing , and all I 've done is change jobs .
ROB: And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and
LAURA: I ca n't go to work with my hair dyed pink . And I can afford to go shopping more now , and I 've met a couple people I like over the last year or so .
ROB: You 're tougher .
LAURA: More confident , maybe .
ROB: Harder .
LAURA: Less neurotic . Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of you life ?
ROB: I 'm alright .
LAURA: Yeah , you 're alright . But you 're certainly not happy . So what happens if you get happy ? And yes I know that 's the title of an Elvis Costello album , I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention . Should we split up because I 'm used to you being miserable ? What happens if you , I do n't know , start you 're own record label , and it 's a success ? Time for a new girlfriend ?
ROB: You 're being stupid .
LAURA: How ? What would be the difference etween you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice ? Rob is silent .
ROB: No use .
DICK: It 's Vince and Justin .
ROB: Who 's that ?
BARRY: The little skate-fuckers .
ROB: No way .
BARRY: Yes way . It 's really Rob and Dick look at him , ready to pounce
ROB: Your tape . It 's good . They mumble thanks .
VINCE: Wait a minute . Island Records charged U2 a million five against thei overhead for one plane ride .
ROB: We 're not there yet , Justin .
VINCE: I 'm Vince .
ROB: Whatever .
JUSTIN: The Kinky Wizards .
ROB: What ?
VINCE: We saw this ad in the personals fo two swingers lookin ' for a Renaissance fair .
ROB: Nice .
VINCE: What 's the name of your label ?
ROB: Broken Records . Welcome aboard .
BARRY: What the fuck is that ?
ROB: What ?
BARRY: I heard you , man . Do n't give me that `` what '' shit . You just told them that you 're gon na put out a ecord with them .
ROB: So ? You even said they 're good .
BARRY: HELLO . DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band , Mr. Branson ? Mr. Phil Spector ?
LAURA: Hey , Barry .
BARRY: Oh , hi .
LAURA: Where 's Rob ?
BARRY: The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite . Do you have an appointment ?
LAURA: What are you talking about ?
BARRY: Just that Rob seems to think it would e wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his itter jealous heart is a musical visionary . That 's all .
ROB: Hi .
LAURA: Hi . What are you doing ?
ROB: Nothing .
LAURA: Wan na go to dinner ?
ROB: Where ?
LAURA: At Paul and Miranda 's . Paul from work .
ROB: Oh . Well . We do n't really get along . Paul and I .
LAURA: I know . But you 've never met . It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him .
ROB: Ha .
PAUL: Lame , right ? Rob turns around to see PAUL behind him .
ROB: Oh , I do n't know . The Beatles are okay . Paul laughs .
PAUL: We 're kinda out of date .
ROB: Hey , to each his own , I say .
PAUL: Maybe we can come by your store and you can hook us up .
ROB: Sure , sure . Any time .
LAURA: Better hurry , though , Paul . Ro started a record label , so he 's gon na e in the shop less and less . Rob looks at her .
ROB: You did that deliberately . You knew all along I 'd like them . It was a trick .
LAURA: I tricked you into meeting some people you 'd think were great . I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way .
ROB: Has Drag City Records , I know , I know . You told Dan Koretzky about this ?
LAURA: Yeah , and he said it 's a good way to eak out a record . Especially fo what he said , and I quote , `` would be a highly anticipated event , locally . '' He helped me put out a press release .
ROB: WHAT ?
LAURA: Just local , of course .
ROB: And the `` triumphant return of DJ Ro Gordon ? '' `` Triumphant ? '' `` Return ? ''
LAURA: I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we were n't togethe anymore . It might even be why I came back .
ROB: You had no right . Supposing I was doing something that could n't be cancelled ?
LAURA: What do you ever do that ca n't be cancelled ?
ROB: That 's not the point . I mean , what if the single is n't done in time ?
LAURA: Barry said its done .
ROB: Barry ? Barry knows about this ?
LAURA: Yeah . His band is playing a set . Rob wheels on her .
ROB: Like fuck you are .
BARRY: Laura said we could . If we helped out with the posters and stuff . And we did . And we are .
ROB: I 'll give you 10 % of the door if you do n't play .
BARRY: We 're getting that anyway .
ROB: What is she doing ? Okay , 20 % .
BARRY: No . We need the gig .
ROB: 110 % . That 's my final offer . I 'm not kidding . That 's how much it means to me not to hear you play .
BARRY: We 're not as bad as you think , Rob .
ROB: You could n't be . Look , Barry . There 's going to be people from Laura 's work there , people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turne albums . How are you going to cope with them ?
BARRY: We 're not called Barrytown anymore , y the by . They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing . We 're called SDM . Sonic Death Monkey .
ROB: Sonic Death Monkey .
BARRY: What do you think ? Dick likes it .
ROB: Barry , you 're over thirty years old . You owe it to yourself and you friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey .
BARRY: I owe it to myself to go right to the edge , Rob , and this group does exactly that . Over the edge , in fact .
ROB: You 'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night .
BARRY: That 's what we want . Reaction . And if Laura 's bourgeois lawyer friends ca n't take it , then fuck 'em . Let 'em riot , we can handle it . We 'll e ready . Barry wanders off laughing .
LAURA: They 'll go on early . Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they ca n't play for more than a half hour .
ROB: It 's no joke . I 'm responsible fo what happens , you know . Embarrassment aside , there 's a lot of money and effort in this , at least by my standards . I have to put down a deposit for the room . I have to pay the pressing plant for the records , sleeve them , sticker them
LAURA: We took care of that . Rob 's brow furrows .
ROB: I suddenly feel choked up . It 's not the money , it 's the way she 's thought of everything one morning I woke up to find her going through my records , pulling out things that she remembered me playing when I deejayed and putting them into the little carrying cases that I used to use and put away in a closet somewhere years ago . She knew I needed a kick in the ass . She also knew how happy I was when I used to deejay . From which every angle I examine it , it still looks as though she 's done all of this ecause she loves me .
LAURA: That 's okay . You seem pissed off all the time , though .
ROB: I know . I do n't get it .
CAROLINE: Excuse me ?
ROB: May I help you ?
CAROLINE: I 'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon .
ROB: Uh . That 's me .
CAROLINE: I 'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader . I want to do a story on you .
ROB: Right . Why ?
CAROLINE: Well , I used to go to the Dodger on your nights , and I saw you 're doing it again and that your putting out a ecord , and it 's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now .
ROB: Oh . Okay .
CAROLINE: I thought I would ask you a few questions if that 's okay .
ROB: Huh . You used to come to the club ? I should n't have let you in . You must have only been about sixteen .
CAROLINE: So . Is now a good time ?
ROB: Yeah . I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it . He winces immediately .
CAROLINE: Yeah , well Let 's see What are you 're all-time top five records ?
ROB: Pardon me ?
CAROLINE: Your desert island top-five .
ROB: Oh boy In the club , or at home ?
CAROLINE: Is there a difference ?
ROB: OF COURSE Well yeah , a bit . `` Sin City '' by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five , but I would n't play it at the club . It 's a country-rock ballad . Everybody 'd go home .
CAROLINE: Nevermind . Any five . So four more .
ROB: What do you mean , four more ?
CAROLINE: Well if one of them is this `` Sin City '' thing
ROB: Can I go home and work this out and let you know ? In a week or so ?
CAROLINE: Look if you ca n't think of anything , it does n't matter . I 'll do one . My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger . Rob is aghast , humiliated , quietly outraged .
ROB: Oh , I 'm sure I can manage something `` Sin City . '' `` New Rose , '' by The Damned . `` Hit It and Quit It '' by Funkadelic . `` Shipbuilding , '' Elvis Costello , Japanese import , no horns , o different horns , anyway um `` Mystery Train '' by Elvis Presley And `` Spaced Cowboy '' by Sly and the Family Stone . A bit controversial , I know , but
CAROLINE: Fine . That 's great .
ROB: Is that it ?
CAROLINE: Well , I would n't mind a quick chat , if you got the time .
ROB: Sure , but is that it for the list ?
CAROLINE: That 's five . So . Why did you decide to deejay again ?
ROB: Well it was a friend 's idea , really , and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it . So I should really put a James Brown in there
CAROLINE: Nice friend .
ROB: Yeah .
CAROLINE: What 's his name ?
ROB: Who ? Oh . My friend . My friend is Laura . A girl . A friend who 's a girl .
CAROLINE: `` Music for Old People . '' What does that mean ?
ROB: Look , I 'm sorry about this , but I 'd like `` the Upsetter '' by Lee `` Scratch '' Perry , in there . Instead of `` Sin City . '' She scribbles and writes .
CAROLINE: Okay . `` Dance Music For Old People ? ''
ROB: Oh , you know a lot of people are n't too old for clubs but they 're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that . They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there 's nowhere for them .
CAROLINE: And the new label ? And the Kinky Wizards ?
ROB: Oh , well , the Kinky Wizards are you know what ? Why do n't I just make you a tape ?
CAROLINE: Would you ? Really ? Wow . I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home .
ROB: Haha . Right . It 's no problem . I love making tapes .
LAURA: Who 's that for ? Rob winces , turns . He 's busted .
ROB: This ? Oh , just that woman who interviewed me for The Reader . Carol ? Caroline ? Something like that . Laura turns and walks out of the room .
LAURA: A drinking lunch on a school day . What a nice surprise . Rob says nothing .
ROB: Not really . He plays with his drink .
LAURA: Are you going to talk to me , or shall I get my paper out ?
ROB: I 'm going to talk to you .
LAURA: Right . He plays with his drink some more .
ROB: I 'm going to talk to you about whethe you want to get married or not . To me .
LAURA: Ha ha ha . Hoo hoo hoo .
ROB: I mean it .
LAURA: I know .
ROB: Oh , well thanks a fucking bunch .
LAURA: I 'm sorry . But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader , were n't you ?
ROB: Not in love , exactly , but
LAURA: Well forgive me if I do n't think of you as the world 's safest bet .
ROB: Would you marry me if I was ?
LAURA: No . Probably not .
ROB: Right . Okay , then . Shall we go ?
LAURA: Do n't sulk . What brought all this on ?
ROB: I do n't know .
LAURA: Very persuasive .
ROB: Are you persuadable ?
LAURA: No . I do n't think so . I 'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days . Fair enough ?
ROB: Fair enough .
LAURA: So ?
ROB: I 'm just sick of thinking about it all the time .
LAURA: About what ?
ROB: This stuff . Love and marriage . I want to think about something else .
LAURA: I 've changed my mind . That 's the most romantic thing I 've ever heard . I do . I will .
ROB: Shut up . I 'm only trying to explain .
LAURA: I mean , maybe you 're right . But were you really expecting me to say yes ?
ROB: I dunno . Did n't think about it , eally . It was the asking that was the important thing .
LAURA: Well , you 've asked .
ROB: Uh , thanks for uh , coming out tonight . I hope you have a good time . And I hope you like the record . The one y the Kinky Wizards . The record that we 're having this record release party for . Thanks . Listen to it first , though . Okay . We 'll get to that later . Right now , I 'd like to introduce Sonic Death Monkey .
LAURA: It 's gon na be fine . These people are ready for anything .
BARRY: Yeah , well

VASSAL #1: By day 's end he will have our heads .
VASSAL #2: We ride against the Suther- lands . That is all that matters .
VASSAL #1: This makes no sense to me .
FRIEND: The fog is bad . We can not even see the sides of ou own ranks . Conor 's nervousness is showing .

FRIEND: It 's begun .
KNIGHT: There can be but one .
VASSAL #1: Leave him ! The clansmen obey .
OFFICER #1: Kevin ! Get is a backup .
TAUPIN: I was merely walking by when-
OFFICER #1: Do n't move . The officer has his pistol out and leveled . His partner runs up , shotgun in hand .
OFFICER #2: They 're on their way .
PRIEST: Libera Domine Animan servi tui sicut libertasi David de manu regis Saul
VASSAL #1: Has the boy died ?
CLANSMAN: He is having the last rites now . It should be over by morning .
VASSAL #1: Never seen anybody cut as ad live so long . He should have died on the field .
CLANSMAN: Tonight or tomorrow , it 's all the same .
PRIEST: Auditorium nostrum in nomine domini
VASSAL #1: This has been a dark day .
PRIEST: Requiescant in pace
EXAMINER: Real clean . No sawing action at all . Whateve it was did it in one swipe . Like the other one .
MORAN: What about that ?
EXAMINER: Has n't any blood on it .
MORAN: About the only thing that does n't .
EXAMINER: I 'll give it a close look when I get back .
OFFICER #3: Come on Brenna , you know etter than that .
BRENNA: I 'm invited .
EXAMINER: Hope this is n't past you edtime .
BRENNA: Does n't have a head , does he ?
EXAMINER: This one came unassembled . Lt. Moran is standing near .
MORAN: Just show her what she came for , Tom .
EXAMINER: Come on , this is more your line of work .
BRENNA: Fine .
EXAMINER: There you go .
BRENNA: Did n't think it was my uddy over there .
EXAMINER: Figured you knew more about swords than I did .
BRENNA: Claymore .
EXAMINER: Huh ?
BRENNA: Scottish claymore . Take a French epee , add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business , and you 've got a claymore .
EXAMINER: You 're the expert .
BRENNA: It 's in good condition .
MORAN: This your present address ?
TAUPIN: Yes .
MORAN: Mr.- Taupin , what were you doing in that alley ?
TAUPIN: I was walking by when I heard a shout . Your men came right after .
MORAN: Did you know the victim ?
TAUPIN: No .
MORAN: His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory .
TAUPIN: It does n't .
MORAN: He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week . Taupin 's face is stoic and controlled .
TAUPIN: American . Moran paces to a corner of the room .
MORAN: Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- orhood at night ?
TAUPIN: What are you getting at ?
MORAN: Let 's just say that in my years with this department I 've seen more than one well dressed business man look fo a hand job on 14th Street .
TAUPIN: That 's none of your business .
MORAN: You 're wrong .
TAUPIN: I presume it 's a sword .
MORAN: A claymore to be exact . You would n't know anything about it would you ?
TAUPIN: Your murder weapon ?
MORAN: It was covered with Mr. Fasil 's fingerprints , but none of his blood .
TAUPIN: A mystery .
MORAN: For the moment .
MOTHER: Ah Steven , it is good to see you .
TRAVELLER: I only just heard of Conor . I came up from Catroch as soon as I could .
MOTHER: You 're a kind man to be sure .
TRAVELLER: I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family .
MOTHER: Steven , Conor did n't die .
TRAVELLER: But I had heard his wounds were mortal .
MOTHER: They were Steven , they were . It 's een a miracle it has . He lasted ight through and healed . No one in the village has ever seen anything like it . Ever .
CONOR: You 're pretty today . Mara is silent . Distant .
MARA: I have no future husband .
CONOR: I do n't understand . Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing .
MARA: My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands .
CONOR: What are you saying ? I 'm standing here as real as you .
MARA: You can not be real , Conor . You had the last rites . No man has been cut half as bad and lived .
CONOR: But I did live .
MARA: Live ? In less than a week you 're prancing about the country like a squirrel .
CONOR: So why the crazy talk ? It 's a miracle it is . Saint Andrew has smiled on me . On us .
MARA: Some think not .
CONOR: Who ?
MARA: There 's rumor in the village . Some call it magic .
CONOR: That 's mad . Surely you do n't take their word ?
MARA: I do n't know , Conor . It 's not natural . Maybe something has touched you .
CONOR: You 're sounding like that mad woman , Widow Baggins .
MARA: Me father has taken back my hand . He puts a hand to her cheek .
CONOR: Ah , Lassie She steps back .
MARA: Please not be touching me , Conor .
CONOR: I 'll not take that kind of talk from you . From those others elow , maybe . But not from you .
MARA: Leave me alone , Conor . Please .
CONOR: You 're not talking sense , Mara ! Anger tumbles into exasperation .
MARA: Do what you must . Resigned , Conor turns and limps away .
RECEPTIONIST: Mrs. Thompson agreed to settle fo fifteen , Melvin 's wants to make a pick-up at three o'clock , the coffee machine 's broken , and there 's a Miss Cartwright from the Smithsonian in your office . Taupin is hardly in the mood .
BRENNA: Do you play ?
TAUPIN: Yes .
BRENNA: Very traditional .
TAUPIN: Miss Cartwright , what is it I can do for you ?
BRENNA: I 'd like to ask you about the claymore .
TAUPIN: It 's not mine .
BRENNA: It 's quite rare you know , some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years .
TAUPIN: Miss Cartwright , unless you have come here to sell the sword , there 's very little I can help you with . Now if you will excuse me , I have a great deal of work to do . Brenna has taken a carving from the shelf .
BRENNA: Byzantine ?
TAUPIN: Basil the II .
BRENNA: Charming guy , Basil . Once afte eating an army of Serbians he linded all but-
TAUPIN: -All but one out of a hundred , I know . All left to be led like donkeys back home . Now if you will please-
BRENNA: Good reflexes .
TAUPIN: Good day , Miss Cartwright .
BRENNA: I do n't believe him .
SUPERVISOR: Why ?
BRENNA: He 's too cool . Too sharp . I think he 's got something to do with it .
RESEARCHER #1: Oh , has your penetrating research on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos suddenly made you an expert on the criminal mentality ?
BRENNA: Screw off , Larry . The men , LAUGH . They delight in baiting her .
RESEARCHER #2: The cops bought it . They let him go .
BRENNA: What could they hold him for ? I think they 're just waiting fo something concrete before they haul him in for real . We should look into it . He had to have gotten that sword from somewhere .
SUPERVISOR: Hang on a sec , you did your little favor for the boys downtown , I 'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here .
BRENNA: I 've seen nobleman swords that were n't as well preserved . It 's just a hunk of peasant iron . Why would he be carrying it around in an alley ?
RESEARCHER #1: Here we go . Everytime there 's a murder in town we have to put up with junior D.A .
RESEARCHER #2: Must be genetic .
BRENNA: Someone should check him out . Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over . He has one , he might have two .
SUPERVISOR: You see that desk ? _Your_ desk ? You see the crap piled up on it ?
BRENNA: Give it a rest Ned , huh ?
RESEARCHER #2: Might be interesting to see what his family connections are . That 's a hell of a piece to be just chuck- ing around in an alley .
SUPERVISOR: I swear to God Brenna , between you and Thompson 's novels I 'm going to get a bloody ulcer .
CONOR: Evening , Douglas .
DOUGLAS: Conor .
CONOR: Ale suits me .
MOTHER: Please take care of yourself .
CONOR: Aye . Conor turns to his father .
FATHER: I wish there was some other way . They clasp hands .
CONOR: Goodbye .
DESK OFFICER: This is against the rules .
BRENNA: So 's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
DESK OFFICER: -Okay okay .
BRENNA: You owe me . Besides , I 'm cute . The computer returns a reply onto a printer .
DESK OFFICER: Taupin , Richard Marshall . Born March 16 , 1945 in Church Hill , Maryland . Received first drive permit 1967 in Philadelphia .
BRENNA: Church Hill , that 's pretty close , is n't it ?
DESK OFFICER: Anything in Maryland is close .
TAUPIN: Where is he ? Bulging eyes stare at him .
BRENNA: TaupinTaupin
KIDELL: 1945 , that strains the memory . Here we are , Richard Taupin .
BRENNA: No thank you , I 'm fine .
KIDELL: He was unsual .
BRENNA: Why ?
KIDELL: Well , this is a small town , and it was even smaller then . Most all the babies I delivered were from local families . Richard 's parents were just passing through when his mother 's time came . I did it right here at the house .
BRENNA: Then you did n't know Richard later on .
KIDELL: No .
BRENNA: I 've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies .
KIDELL: Do n't know about any of that . Suppose nobody does .
BRENNA: I do n't follow you .
KIDELL: Poor little tyke did n't have a chance . Hopelessly premature . He died a few days after he was born .
BRENNA: The boy _died_ ?
KIDELL: Mother too . Sad case it was . The young lady just could n't make it through labor . Never even saw he son .
BRENNA: Have you spoken to anyone else about this ?
KIDELL: There was this one fella . Asked a lot of questions . I was out of town but I heard he spent nea a full day in the records office .
BRENNA: Would you remember his name ?
KIDELL: Carl Smith .
OFFICER: Just tell us when you see the one .
UNCLE JOE: Forget it .
BRENNA: I 'm just curious .
UNCLE JOE: You 're never `` just curious '' . You 've met my neice , Brenna .
ASSISTANT: Hi Brenna .
OFFICER: Number 5 , lift your coat up more .
UNCLE JOE: Are n't you getting a little old fo this ? You flunked out of law school .
BRENNA: Now there 's a new topic .
UNCLE JOE: Do n't they have enough for you to do at the castle ?
BRENNA: Thanks .
UNCLE JOE: Call your mother . You never call her .
OFFICER: Well ?
OLD LADY: I do n't know . I 'd have to see his thing .
BRENNA: I ca n't figure out why he 's doing it . He 's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967 . And the guys rich . You should see the stuff he has in that shop .
DENNIS: Maybe he 's hiding from something .
BRENNA: Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill . I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank . So he is n't a cop . District anyway .
DENNIS: Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife .
BRENNA: Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral . The fathe looked just like Richard . Even had a mark on his cheek .
DENNIS: How old is Richard ?
BRENNA: P.D . says 41 , but he barely looks
DENNIS: Find the father . That should clea things up .
BRENNA: Yeah .
DENNIS: He 'd want to know about all this .
BRENNA: Mr. Congeniality ? Let him find his own clues . There 's a journal article in this somewhere .
DENNIS: Uncle Joey 's little girl . Ca n't get the taste out of her mouth . Dennis puts on his police cap .
BRENNA: Sure .
OFFICER: They found it .
MORAN: There 's been another murder .
TAUPIN: My condolences .
MORAN: Where were you Tuesday night ?
TAUPIN: Home .
MORAN: A neighbor saw your car leave .
TAUPIN: He 's mistaken .
MORAN: Look , I do n't know what the hell you 're up to , but I think I 've got a pretty good idea .
TAUPIN: Do you ?
MORAN: All I need is time .
TAUPIN: I 've got all the time in the world . Except right now . If you will excuse me , Lieutenant . In no hurry , Taupin leads his horse away .
BRENNA: Someone beat you .
TAUPIN: Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries , Miss Cartwright ?
BRENNA: Grave robbers ?
TAUPIN: Probably .
BRENNA: Who ?
TAUPIN: People like that rarely leave usiness cards .
BRENNA: Does Carl Smith ? A flash of interest , quickly suppressed .
TAUPIN: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
BRENNA: I think you do . Better yet , I do n't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place . And I think Mr. Smith , whoever he is , now knows that .
TAUPIN: You have an active imagination .
BRENNA: I 've been to Church Hill .
TAUPIN: Miss Cartwright , you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you . I strongly suggest you eturn to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries . He starts for the gate .
BRENNA: I could find him . Taupin stops .
TAUPIN: I doubt that . Good day , Miss Cartwright . He walks on .
BRENNA: What 's wrong ? He holds up an open palm to silence her .
TAUPIN: Your help may be unneccessary . The air is still .
VOICE: Good afternoon , `` Mr. Taupin '' .
KNIGHT: Long time .
TAUPIN: Not so long .
KNIGHT: My quarry grows clever with age . And the others , incompetent . The Knight throws Brenna a glance .
TAUPIN: Of sorts .
KNIGHT: I do hope she enjoys a good show .
WATCHMAN: Hey ! What 's going on here ?
TAUPIN: Run ! Brenna is frozen in shock . Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate .
KNIGHT: MACLEOD !
BRENNA: Jesus Christ .
TAUPIN: You 'll be safe here . He wo n't kill in a church .
BRENNA: Why not ?
TAUPIN: Tradition .
BRENNA: What the hell is going on ?
CONOR: Afternoon .
ROMIREZ: Your name is Conor ?
CONOR: Aye .
ROMIREZ: Juan Cid Romirez . Chief surveyor and alchemist .
CONOR: You 're not from these parts .
ROMIREZ: I am from Spain . And I would like a moment of your time .
CONOR: I have n't much to offer , Mr. Romirez from Spain , ut you 're welcome to what 's here .
ROMIREZ: Please go to no trouble .
CONOR: Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I can not even re- member .
ROMIREZ: Your marks would suggest great injury .
CONOR: I was nearly killed .
ROMIREZ: But you lived .
CONOR: I did at that .
ROMIREZ: And but for a mark you are well as any man , no ?
CONOR: Aye .
ROMIREZ: I should imagine that you ecovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers , perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation . And a solution . Something is n't right . Conor turns and faces him .
CONOR: I was driven out .
ROMIREZ: And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew .
CONOR: How can you know this ?
ROMIREZ: First food , no ? A good meal makes conversation so much easier .
CONOR: Pheasant .
ROMIREZ: You Scots have a way with game . It still has life in it . Spirit . Back home the food is sodomestic .
CONOR: Why are you here ?
ROMIREZ: I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal .
CONOR: You 're a long way from Inverness .
ROMIREZ: In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and ought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth .
CONOR: You know me home . Me name .
ROMIREZ: It was time for our paths to cross . Romirez pulls back the sleeve on his cloak .
CONOR: You are the same ?
ROMIREZ: Do you ever feel a flow , as if some- thing were pushing against you ?
CONOR: Yes . Always .
ROMIREZ: Does it change with me in the room ?
CONOR: It is less .
ROMIREZ: You feel you know me .
CONOR: I do n't know why .
ROMIREZ: We are brothers .
CONOR: He told me there could be only one .
ROMIREZ: Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known The Game . You and I Conor , we are different from all others around us . You know this , you can feel it . We are flesh and bone like any man , but unlike our neighbors we are rathe difficult to injure , permanently .
CONOR: I do n't understand .
ROMIREZ: You are still so very young .
CONOR: I 'm twenty-two .
ROMIREZ: Not even a single lifetime . Romirez chooses his words very carefully .
CONOR: What ?
ROMIREZ: We are immortal . Stunned , Conor backs away from Romirez .
CONOR: No , that ca n't be . Romirez grasps Conor 's shoulder .
ROMIREZ: It is as you are .
CONOR: No ! This is all too much for Conor .
ROMIREZ: Listen to me . Hear the words .
CONOR: This is madness !
ROMIREZ: It is the truth .
CONOR: No !
MALE VOICE: This is Dr. Wickland at GWU . You test came back today . You can call me here at the med center if you have any questions . Click . Beep .
SUPERVISOR'S VOICE: Brenna , where the hell are you ? The place is full of cops asking weird questions . What 's going on ? I 've got work stacking up . Get in here right away .
KNIGHT'S VOICE: Brenna . She freezes in her tracks .
MOTHER'S VOICE: Hi Brenna , it 's mom . Me and your neices just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday . Crissy made a real cute card for you , be sure to call her . Will you be home for Easter ? Call when you can . Love you . Click . Hiss .
ROMIREZ: Three days you 've laid there . It 's time you ate .
CONOR: This ca n't be .
ROMIREZ: You are not dead , boy . Accept it .
CONOR: This is monstrous . I 'll burn in hell for all eternity .
ROMIREZ: You 'd have to die first . Aqui . Conor starts CRYING .
CONOR: What is to become of me ? Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost ?
ROMIREZ: You will live . Survive .
CONOR: Then they were right . I am evil . This is God 's punishment .
ROMIREZ: You have done nothing wrong Cono MacLeod .
CONOR: Oh my God . Oh my God I 'm lost .
ROMIREZ: You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less ?
CONOR: Aye .
ROMIREZ: It is always less with my living . Far or near . But if I were to die the push would become stronge than ever before . There is powe in this . And as long as you and I live , The Knight can never have it all .
CONOR: But we can not be killed .
ROMIREZ: There is an imperfection . For all your healing , if your head eve leaves your neck , you are dead . You can survive anything but steel against your threat . Then it is over . The end .
CONOR: How can I stop such a man ?
ROMIREZ: Hide . Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn . You must learn to defend yourself . In this I can help .
CONOR: Why ?
ROMIREZ: We are brothers . And you are a defense- -of sorts .
MR. NORTH: When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up .
TAUPIN: The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs ?
MR. NORTH: Oh yes , more than enough .
TAUPIN: His only kid .
MR. NORTH: Sure take after him . Never seen a father and son look more alike .
TAUPIN: We were very close .
MR. NORTH: The resemblance is amazing .
TAUPIN: When may I expect the cleaners ?
MR. NORTH: I 'll send them right up .
MAN: That stuff 'll put you away if you 're not careful .
BRENNA: There was a Count . Count Dusan . He would invite the local peasants to his chateau , fill them full of wine , then slice their bellies so he could reuse it . The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me .
MAN: You 're very macabre .
BRENNA: It 's my birthday .
MAN: Happy birthday .
BRENNA: Thanks .
KAHN: MacLeod . Taupin is anxious , poised for attack . Kahn breaks into a broad smile .
TAUPIN: Kahn ?
KAHN: Are you going to offer me a chai or leave me standing here all night ?
TAUPIN: Sit . Kahn takes his place across the table .
KAHN: Head still secure to the neck .
TAUPIN: How did you find me ?
KAHN: How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime ? Taupin looks to his own glass .
TAUPIN: What are you doing here ?
KAHN: It is the gathering , my friend . The settling of old scores . Taupin tenses .
TAUPIN: And have you something to settle with me ?
KAHN: Not tonight . Tonight I have a drink with an old friend .
TAUPIN: It 's good to see you , Kahn . The waitress sets down two glasses .
KAHN: Come , toast with me the past . To old conquests , old loves , and to a time when we cared about either . Kahn drains his glass .
TAUPIN: Neuvich , the clown of the crusades .
KAHN: But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross , climbs off his papal horse , draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on . And what did Neuvich , dea dear drunken Neuvich do ?
TAUPIN: Offered the Pope one of his whores . They LAUGH .
KAHN: Good times then . A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears . Not like now . The jogger shakes his head and runs on .
TAUPIN: He found us even there .
KAHN: He always did .
TAUPIN: I have n't drunk this much since-
KAHN: -Since you last saw me .
TAUPIN: You were never a kid .
KAHN: I knew his great-grandfather .
TAUPIN: You 're insane .
KAHN: No , seriously . We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon .
TAUPIN: How do you do it , Kahn ? How do you live so full of life for so long ?
KAHN: Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have . All else is just marking time . You 're marking time .
TAUPIN: I 've had a few more concerns .
KAHN: The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth .
TAUPIN: You 're wrong .
KAHN: You do n't run as hard , MacLeod . You just do n't run as hard anymore .
AUCTIONEER: I apoligize for the lateness of the hour , but I 'm sure you will all agree the quality of this year 's collection is well worth the time .
BRENNA: No , I-
BRENNA: Mr. Taupin ? I have to talk to you . Nothing has been left unturned or unbroken .
TAUPIN: Finished ?
BRENNA: He tried to kill me last night .
TAUPIN: Where ?
BRENNA: Dupont Circle .
TAUPIN: At the moment ? Carl Smith .
BRENNA: And you ? He ignores the question .
TAUPIN: You need n't worry Miss Cartwright . I 've been at this a very long time .
BRENNA: He called you `` MacLeod '' .
TAUPIN: Not your concern .
BRENNA: I left a man dead in Felton . But you do n't eally care , do you ?
TAUPIN: That bothers you ?
BRENNA: He was innocent .
TAUPIN: He 's dead . Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now .
BRENNA: What about me ?
TAUPIN: You ?
BRENNA: I 'm a witness to a murder . That seems to put me pretty high on your friend 's chop list .
TAUPIN: Have you gone to the police ?
BRENNA: No .
TAUPIN: Why not ? I 'm sure they 'd love to hear your story .
BRENNA: I 'd rather hear yours .
TAUPIN: You are being foolish .
BRENNA: I 'm a historian , Mr. Taupin . Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face .
TAUPIN: Go home . He walks to the doorway .
BRENNA: Why does he want to kill you ? Taupin stops , his back to her .
TAUPIN: He sees me as a threat .
BRENNA: Are you ? Taupin walks out the door .
ROMIREZ: Concentrate ! Conor thrusts . Romirez blocks .
CONOR: Me arm hurts .
ROMIREZ: Again . Try again . Conor strikes . Romirez easily blocks .
CONOR: Go to hell .
ROMIREZ: Oh , the boy has a mouth , now if only he had an arm .
CONOR: Impotent cow .
ROMIREZ: Muy Bien !
CONOR: It 's like to kill me first .
ROMIREZ: You have a gift . One you must protect .
CONOR: And what is this great gift that can not be seen or smelt ?
ROMIREZ: The Fabric of life . The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another .
CONOR: If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain , I 'm afraid you 've failed .
ROMIREZ: Come . Enough sword play for an afternoon .
CONOR: You 're no match for Scot , Mr. Romirez . We 're raised as riders .
ROMIREZ: Point conceeded , Mr. MacLeod .
CONOR: What is the fascinatioon ? It is only a leaf .
ROMIREZ: All living things pay dues , Conor . They must be respected for that .
CONOR: I do not think I like the sound of that .
ROMIREZ: It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds . But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening . For it gives you great strength . The strength of _knowledge_ . The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always e .
CONOR: I feel hardly nothing .
ROMIREZ: You have not been fully trained . But you will learn . And you will be good , I can feel that . You have apt- itude . This is why our friend is so concerned .
CONOR: But why be so concerned about me ?
ROMIREZ: This power is divided amongst you , me , and others like cuts in a pie . But the cuts are not equal . Some , like you and he , have more . Much more .
CONOR: And you ?
ROMIREZ: I am a small player . But if by helping you I can keep that monste from being the last , then perhaps my life has meant something .
CONOR: I am not ready for this .
ROMIREZ: You must be . You have responsibilities . You must learn the rules . You can neve attract attention to yourself , neve show the side that will draw others to you . You will always know when you are in the presence of another . Beware . But more importantly Conor MacLeod , will e your battle against time . In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat . People will ecome a transitory , pathetic lot . The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition thei greed and quest represent . But life without morality , without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love , is no life at all . That is how the others exist . Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last . Keep your soul sewed to the earth . Do not become one of them .
CONOR: Of course .
ROMIREZ: You are young , inexperienced . You do not know what time can do . How it can sap all pity , all love .
CONOR: That is not me .
ROMIREZ: With the proper tools , Conor , a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one .
VILLAGER: Conor !
CONOR: Yes , Darin .
VILLAGER: Hate to be bothering you like this , ut me mare threw a shoe . Conor looks to Romirez .
ROMIREZ: Go ahead , Senor . I have my friend to keep me company .
CONOR: I 'll be back when I can . Conor sets off across the pasture .
KNIGHT: Romirez . What a surprise . Romirez is struggling under the debris . The Knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg . The limb is severed .
ROMIREZ: Madonna ! The Knight begins casting aside the shelving .
KNIGHT: Bastard ! He crashes back against the wall .
ROMIREZ: Oh , Santa Maria !
KNIGHT: Why run ?
ROMIREZ: Demonio !
KNIGHT: To hell with you .
LIBRARIAN: Come on Brenna , your ass is already in a sling , do n't drag me into it .
BRENNA: All I need is for you to check the name .
LIBRARIAN: You talked to your superviso lately ? He 's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight . That on top of the cops bugging him .
BRENNA: I 'll take care of that Corey , but I need this now . The librarian looks her over skeptically .
LIBRARIAN: It 's that important ?
BRENNA: Yeah .
RESEARCHER: Wilson know about this ?
BRENNA: I 'm doing it on my own .
LIBRARIAN: Good way to lose your job .
BRENNA: Some job . Card filing and cabinet dusting . Four years in this dump and I have n't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak could n't do .
LIBRARIAN: I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts . Too bad no one else did .
BRENNA: It 's bullshit . Everything . My job , the people I get involved with , I 'm up to here with it .
LIBRARIAN: You always were hard to impress . The librarian pulls a binder and opens it .
BRENNA: Who is it ?
LIBRARIAN: Not who . What . Worstick 's a town in Pennsylvania .
BRENNA: Chris , have you seen my notebook ?
MORAN: A murder .
BRENNA: You better have a warrant . That 's my notebook , you 've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it .
MORAN: I 've got a morgue filling up with odies . That 's my right .
BRENNA: What do you want from me ?
MORAN: Well , the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town . And all of a sudden the Smithsonian 's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons . Brenna lifts the telephone receiver .
BRENNA: I 'm calling an attorney .
MORAN: You and I should talk first .
BRENNA: We 've got nothing to say . Moran presses the post on the phone .
MORAN: What are you going to tell them ? That you 're protecting a man who 's killed four people ?
BRENNA: Four ?
MORAN: All fashionably without heads .
BRENNA: Spare me the details .
MORAN: But there 's more . Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton , Delaware . Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise , they turn out to be registered to ou own Brenna Cartwright and the eve popular Richard Taupin .
BRENNA: What are you getting at , Moran ?
MORAN: You 've been a busy little beaver . Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill . Your notes are very complete . Naturally my feelings were crushed when you did n't rush right ove and tell us what you knew . In fact , we 're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder .
BRENNA: It 'll never stick .
MORAN: But we might just give it the 'ole college try . What with the court back ups , it could be days efore you got an arraignment . But then , I 'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A . knows all about that .
BRENNA: You 're an asshole , Moran .
MORAN: I want Taupin .
BRENNA: What makes you so sure he 's the one ?
MORAN: Just for laughs we raided wonde oy 's house . There was a gallon of one of the corpse 's blood in his carpet . I think it was about then I withdrew his name fo humanitarian of the year .
BRENNA: What 's all of this got to do with me ?
MORAN: What were you doing in Felton ?
BRENNA: Research . If your pal was there I never saw him .
MORAN: I have witnesses that can put the two of you together .
BRENNA: Never take up poker , Detective .
MORAN: Do n't be stupid , lady . Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else 's . Brenna reaches across and lifts her notebook .
BRENNA: Why do n't you wait until it comes out in paperback ?
DENNIS: I warned you .
BRENNA: Go to hell .
TAUPIN: You should n't have come .
BRENNA: No .
TAUPIN: No one knows you 're here ?
BRENNA: No . I had to talk to you .
TAUPIN: You had to do _nothing_ !
BRENNA: You 're wrong .
TAUPIN: You 're a fool .
BRENNA: Maybe . Pause . Taupin strides through the doorway .
TAUPIN: Come inside .
BRENNA: Is this what you killed them with ?
TAUPIN: You 've been listening to rumors .
BRENNA: Our cars were seen together in Felton . They 're calling me an accessory to murder .
TAUPIN: You are . Now . Beat . They 're stuck with each other .
OFFICER: No , that 's the last place we saw her . Okay , will do . He hangs up .
PARTNER: Well ?
OFFICER: We keep looking .
PARTNER: Wonderful .
BRENNA: What 's all that ?
TAUPIN: Richard Taupin has become cumbersome . It would be best if he just disappeared . Brenna walks to the window .
BRENNA: You did kill those men .
TAUPIN: Not all of them .
BRENNA: When you finish , what then ?
TAUPIN: I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin .
BRENNA: You make it all sound so simple .
TAUPIN: The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I 've aquired . That equires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg . But that 's where you come in .
BRENNA: You want me to front for you .
TAUPIN: The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the etter . You , as Mrs. Taupin , will attract considerably less attention than I. Brenna is unsure .
INSPECTOR: They lost her outside of Thurmont .
MORAN: I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff .
INSPECTOR: Figure she 's with him ?
MORAN: Yeah .
INSPECTOR: We ran down that Church Hill info . She 's right . There is no Richard Taupin .
MORAN: Any other I.D.s come up ?
INSPECTOR: Not yet . Called FBI yesterday . Thompson 's going to try CIA this afternoon . Y'never know . Moran rises and dons his coat .
MORAN: Should have seen him the first night . Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and did n't even blink .
INSPECTOR: You 'd think he 'd had practice . Moran walks to the door .
MORAN: I think he has .
AIDE: The men are assembled , Major . A GENERAL stands beside the major .
GENERAL: See that they are indeed ready , Dupont .
STAFF SARGEANT: Regiment ready for review , sir . Dupont walks past the sargeant to the line .
DUPONT: Stand straight , you are a soldie of the King .
SOLDIER #1: Yes sir .
DUPONT: Where is your bayonet ?
SOLIDER #3: Lost it sir .
DUPONT: Where ? The soldier hedges .
STAFF SARGEANT: You heard the Major ! Where !
SOLDIER #3: Whorehouse sir .
DUPONT: Your rifle . Hand it to me .
SARGEANT: Yes sir .
DUPONT: See to it .
SARGEANT: Yes sir .
DUPONT: Your name ?
MULET: Mulet .
CAPTAIN: And what a sight ! That old mare just kept falling over he own guts till someone finally shot her . The OFFICERS LAUGH . All but Dupont .
MAJOR: Complete your inspection ?
DUPONT: They 're nothing but boys . It will be a slaughter tomorrow .
MAJOR: I doubt much can change that . The enemy has five brigades waiting for us .
DUPONT: We need more time .
MAJOR: Wo n't get it . We are a sacrifice . A diversion . Dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate .
DUPONT: Not likely .
MULET: Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking .
DUPONT: What is your position ?
MULET: Second musketeer .
DUPONT: I understand you joined up in Bremen .
MULET: You seem to understand a great deal .
DUPONT: I am a Major , Private . You would do well remembering that when addressing me .
MULET: Excuse me , `` sir '' . I thought we spoke as equals .
DUPONT: Equals ?
MULET: If you wish to play games , Major . Mulet returns to his chore .
DUPONT: Wait . I think we understand each other .
MULET: We have no understanding .
DUPONT: Then it is time two of us did . You are very young . I was once young . I can help . Mulet LAUGHS .
MULET: Help ? I 've seen others `` help '' . Somehow a head always ended up on the counter .
DUPONT: It can be different . It must be .
MULET: It never changes , Major .
DUPONT: We must talk .
MULET: Stay out of it .
DUPONT: Do n't threaten me , Private .
MULET: Who do you think I am ? One of you freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow ? `` Threaten you '' ? You and I just living will always be a threat . Forever . Look at your life , Major . Look at mine . Nothing there ut threat . Threats and nothingness . It 's what we live for . Mulet turns his back on Dupont . Dupont draws his cutlass .
DUPONT: Do not turn your back on me .
MULET: You are really going to force this , are n't you ?
DUPONT: Either you are with me or against me . Mulet turns slowly , axe in hand .
MULET: Have I a choice ? The two stare into eyes empty of emotion . Mulet 's hand flinches . An attack ?
DUPONT: I had no choice . Dupont sighs and looks to the altar .
KNIGHT: Certainly not me .
DUPONT: Tradition .
KNIGHT: It 's all we have . Dupont has backed up a few paces .
DUPONT: Not so scared .
KNIGHT: Perhaps not . You seem to have misplaced a private . No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck .
DUPONT: No doubt .
KNIGHT: You surprise me . Eliminating a ival like that . Such are the actions of a man of conquest . I was mistaken . 300 years have turned the boy 's fear into ambit- ion .
DUPONT: You 're wrong .
KNIGHT: I know you very well , Conor MacLeod . And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you . Mulet , Romirez , they were fools without vision . It was destined that the oard would be cleared for the real players . The Knight almost seems proud of Dupont .
DUPONT: Romirez understood . Not you .
KNIGHT: Romirez is dust . The Knight looks to the altar .
DUPONT: Finish yours ?
KNIGHT: Our common heritage . I am your only real friend , you know . The only one who truly understands you . I look forward to the day we meet again . And I kill you .
DUPONT: So sure ?
KNIGHT: You ca n't stay in church forever . The Knight moves into the aisle .
MR. NORTH: Morning Mr. North
TAUPIN: Same .
MR. NORTH: Such a pretty day . If I live to be 90 I 'll never tire of mornings like this . Mind you I 'm 74 now .
TAUPIN: No .
MR. NORTH: Yes sir . When you get older you priorities change . It 's the simple things that count . Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing .
TAUPIN: I 'm sure that 's true .
GRANDSON: Thanks . Taupin 's show of affection surprises Brenna .
TAUPIN: Show you a trick .
GRANDSON: Where did you learn that ?
TAUPIN: My father taught me .
GRANDSON: Your father must be smart .
TAUPIN: Yes , he was . Brenna is touched .
TAUPIN: There was a man once . Just a simple woodcarver . But he understood . More than anyone he could see to the heart of it . It never ends . Today is the same as the first . Tomorrow will be the same as today . So much time . And all of it wasted . You love history ?
BRENNA: Yes .
TAUPIN: I wish I could .
BRENNA: The estate stuff is pretty straight forward . Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat .
TAUPIN: It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg . Brenna is silent .
BRENNA: No . So what now ? We just wait ?
TAUPIN: Yes .
BRENNA: Well , as long as we 're stuck here . She hands him the poster from earlier .
TAUPIN: They do it each year .
BRENNA: I thought it might be a nice break from all of this . Taupin stacks the documents into a folder .
TAUPIN: Maybe it would do us both good .
BRENNA: There 's a catch . You 're supposed to wear 19th century clothing .
TAUPIN: My father was something of a junk collector .
BRENNA: It 's beautiful .
TAUPIN: A little dusty .
KATHERINE: Do it again . She is thoroughly charmed by Conor .
CONOR: All right .
KATHERINE: Oh please . Another one .
CONOR: What would you like ?
KATHERINE: Something pretty .
CONOR: Like you .
KATHERINE: That 's wonderful . Where did you ever learn it ?
CONOR: Far away .
KATHERINE: Kiss me .
YOUNG MAN: You 'll be leaving the girl alone .
KATHERINE: David .
CONOR: Do you have cause to bothering us ?
YOUNG MAN: That 's my girl .
KATHERINE: David , we 've already spoken of this .
YOUNG MAN: He 's not what he pretends to be . Conor climbs to his feet .
CONOR: You best leave , son .
YOUNG MAN: You think you 're so high and mighty , coming into town and taking a man 's woman . Well I know about you . I know about the things you do .
CONOR: I said you best leave .
YOUNG MAN: You 'd like that , would n't you ? Ask him about his friends . The ones he meets in the town square . Ask him about the blade he keeps eneath his bed .
CONOR: Leave . While you still can . The youth pushes away from the grasp .
YOUNG MAN: You do n't frighten me .
CONOR: I should .
KATHERINE: No ! Leave him . Please do n't hurt him . Please .
YOUNG MAN: He 's not what you think . He turns and runs down the road .
KATHERINE: I do n't care who you are or where you come from . She hugs him tightly .
MR. NORTH: Mr. Taupin ! Glad you could make it . Best get some punch before it 's gone . Near the whole valley showed up . They go to the table .
WOMAN: If I did n't know better I 'd say William Taupin .
TAUPIN: His son . Richard .
MR. NORTH: Mr. Taupin is up from Washington to look over his father 's estate .
WOMAN: Your father died some years ago . This is your first visit ? The tone is snide .
TAUPIN: Of sorts .
WOMAN: I suppose a Taupin had to show up eventually .
TAUPIN: Good evening , Mrs. Butler .
BRENNA: What was all that about ?
MR. NORTH: Sorry Mr. Taupin . That 's not meant for you . Just some did n't take much to your father .
BRENNA: Why ?
TAUPIN: My father was never one for social whirls .
MR. TAUPIN: Kept to himself for sure . Then with all that business in '31 .
BRENNA: What business ?
MR. NORTH: Family down the road from the Taupin place was murdered . All cut up they were . Horrible . Two strangers were also found with the bodies . No one ever accused William , but with his reputation as a loner and the rumors about him and some of the wives in town , folks just never forgot . Most were relieved when they heard he 'd died . Sorry Mr. Taupin .
TAUPIN: Nothing to be sorry about .
MR. NORTH: Just your pappy scared some .
PORTLY: All right , the kids have had thei fun . Now it 's time for a little more traditional dancing .
BRENNA: I do n't know any of these . I 'll make a fool of myself .
TAUPIN: Follow me .
BRENNA: William Taupin seems to have left his mark .
TAUPIN: Yes .
BRENNA: And you are William Taupin , are n't you ?
TAUPIN: Yes .
BRENNA: You 're using your son 's name .
TAUPIN: No . Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to . When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it . Twenty years later I ecame the son . Brenna is staring at him .
BRENNA: Then you must be at least 70 years old .
TAUPIN: At least .
BRENNA: That 's impossible .
TAUPIN: A factor of age .
BRENNA: I hope I never get that old .
TAUPIN: You wo n't . Brenna pulls away .
BRENNA: I must be insane . Leaving work , ditching cops . All to follow a murderer . A very old murderer , ut a murderer just the same .
TAUPIN: Why are you here ?
BRENNA: I 've been telling myself it 's the award winning journal article I 'm going to write . But it 's not . It 's you .
TAUPIN: I see .
BRENNA: I 'm not even sure why .
TAUPIN: Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer .
BRENNA: My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses . I ca n't stand it . But you 're different . It 's in you hands . A clarity .
TAUPIN: You are a very perceptive young woman .
BRENNA: Just a little crazy . A thoughtful pause .
TAUPIN: Miss Cartwright , it 's time I showed you something .
BRENNA: My God . The sight is overwhelming .
TAUPIN: I had this room built some time ago .
BRENNA: Who are you ?
TAUPIN: That would be difficult to explain .
BRENNA: I 'd like you to try .
TAUPIN: I was born Conor MacLeod in the village of Ardvrek on the High- land plain of Strathnaver in the clan of MacLeod under the King of Scotland . On the eleventh of December , 1408 . He replaces the icon .
BRENNA: That 's why Smith called you MacLeod .
TAUPIN: Yes .
BRENNA: He knows about you .
TAUPIN: He is older than I .
BRENNA: What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction .
TAUPIN: Sometimes I think it 's just fo something to do . A conquest to e the last . Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away . Some- thing to replace the love that can never work .
BRENNA: That 's insane .
TAUPIN: Perhaps . There is something more . An inheritance .
BRENNA: Of bodies .
TAUPIN: I did n't kill the watchman .
BRENNA: You killed those other two .
TAUPIN: Not the same .
BRENNA: What about that family in '31 ?
TAUPIN: Sometimes innocents become involved .
BRENNA: You and your buddy make a real team , do n't you ? Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between .
TAUPIN: There are differences .
BRENNA: You kill with your left hand ?
TAUPIN: I have n't killed _you_ .
BRENNA: Is that a threat ? Taupin moves very close .
TAUPIN: No . Brenna 's face softens . She turns away .
BRENNA: Do n't .
TAUPIN: Come here , Brenna .
BRENNA: Damn you . He kisses her .
MINISTER: May God commend into his kingdom the soul of our dear departed Jason , son of Katherine- The old woman .
OLD WOMAN: You .
CONOR: Katherine .
OLD WOMAN: What are you doing here ?
CONOR: I owe him this .
OLD WOMAN: He never knew you .
SON #1: Is something wrong , Mother ?
OLD WOMAN: Howard . James . This is you father
TAUPIN: `` Brenna '' . In Celtic is means `` woman with raven hair '' . Only chieftan 's daughters were allowed it . Brenna is lost in Taupin 's scars .
BRENNA: What is it like ? Being you ?
TAUPIN: Empty . And fear . Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you . It can never last , and in the end you always end up destroying oth .
BRENNA: But you 're known so much . History I 'll only read about .
TAUPIN: It 's all the same . Half lives that never go away .
BRENNA: What is it you want ?
TAUPIN: All of it finished .
BRENNA: Will I see you again ?
TAUPIN: Be careful . Do n't stay any longer than you have to .
MORAN: Are you sure ?
INSPECTOR: Wo n't know till the ecords department comes ack with it this after- noon . Looks good though . They found the receipt in his townhouse . It was pretty smeared but had Taupin 's father listed as a signatory .
MORAN: Round up who you can and put them on standby .
INSPECTOR: Think we should call the local P.D . out there first ?
MORAN: No . I want this to be all ours .
CLERK: O.K . Mrs. Taupin , that 's all I need .
CLERK #2: I 'll be right back . She disappears into the rear area .
BRENNA: Do you have a drinking fountain ?
CLERK #3: Around the corner .
BRENNA: Oh God
KNIGHT'S VOICE: We have some unfinished usiness .
TAUPIN: Are you here ?
KNIGHT'S VOICE: I want you to come to me .
TAUPIN: And if I refuse ?
KNIGHT'S VOICE: Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright 's head . This affects him .
TAUPIN: Should I care ?
KNIGHT: You have three hours .
INSPECTOR: He 's not here .
KNIGHT: Welcome . Taupin stands at the entrance .
TAUPIN: Let her go .
KNIGHT: You disappoint me . I thought you 'd finally gotten ove that sort of thing .
TAUPIN: Leave her out of this .
KNIGHT: As you wish .
BOY: It 's from over near the memorial .
MORAN: Moran . All right , get a patrol unit out there right away . I 'll meet them .
KNIGHT: No . Not now .
DENNIS: Brenna ?
KNIGHT: Get up .
TAUPIN: What 's the point ?
KNIGHT: This is n't done . Get up .
TAUPIN: What 's the point ! You have me , finish it !
KNIGHT: I have waited forever for this . You will not cheapen it , little oy .
TAUPIN: Tradition .
KNIGHT: It 's all we have .
TAUPIN: Go to hell . The Knight looks to Brenna .
KNIGHT: Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play .
TAUPIN: Leave her alone .
KNIGHT: Get up .
BRENNA: You bastard !
KNIGHT: Be silent .
BRENNA: Leave him alone .

BURNS' VOICE: I said scram ! They close the door hurriedly .
HILDY: May I have a cigarette , please ?
BURNS: How long is it ?
HILDY: How long is what ?
BURNS: You know what . How long since we 've seen each other ?
HILDY: Let 's see . I was in Reno six weeks then Bermuda Oh , about four months , I guess . Seems like yesterday to me .
BURNS: Maybe it was yesterday . Been seeing me in your dreams ?
HILDY: No Mama does n't dream about you any more , Walter . You would n't know the old girl now .
BURNS: Oh , yes I would . I 'd know you any time
HILDY: You 're repeating yourself ! That 's the speech you made the night you proposed. `` any time any place anywhere ! ''
BURNS: I notice you still remember it .
HILDY: I 'll always remember it . If I had n't emembered it , I would n't have divorced you .
BURNS: You know , Hildy , I sort of wish you had n't done it .
HILDY: Done what ?
BURNS: Divorced me . It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself . It almost gives him a feeling he was n't wanted .
HILDY: Holy mackerel ! Look , Walter , that 's what divorces are for .
BURNS: Nonsense . You 've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever till 'death us do part ' . Why , a divorce does n't mean anything today . It 's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge . We 've got something between us nothing can change .
HILDY: I suppose that 's true in a way . I am fond of you , Walter . I often wish you were n't such a stinker .
BURNS: Now , that 's a nice thing to say .
HILDY: Well , why did you promise me you would n't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works ?
BURNS: Well , I meant to let you go but , you know , you never miss the wate till the well runs dry .
HILDY: A fellow your age , hiring an airplane to write 'Hildy Do n't be hasty remembe my dimple . Walter. ! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge an out to watch it .
BURNS: Well , I do n't want to brag , but I 've still got the dimple and in the same place I just acted like any husband who does n't want to see his home broken up .
HILDY: What home ?
WALTER: What home ? Do n't you remember the home I promised you ?
HILDY: Oh , yes we were to have it right after our honeymoon honeymoon !
BURNS: Was it my fault ? Did I know that coal mine was going to have anothe cave-in ? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon , Hildy honest I did .
HILDY: All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my idegroom , I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky age sixty-three getting food and ai out of a tube ! You do n't deny that . Do you ?
BURNS: Deny it ! I 'm proud of it ! We beat the whole country on that story .
HILDY: Well , suppose we did ? That is n't what I got married for . What 's the good of Look , Walter , I came up here to tell you that you 'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending twenty telegrams all the est of it , because I 'm
BURNS: Let 's not fight , Hildy . Tell you what . You come back to work on the paper and if we find we ca n't get along in a friendly way , we 'll get married again .
HILDY: What ? ! !
BURNS: I have n't any hard feelings .
HILDY: Walter , you 're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way . Now , would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for ?
BURNS: Sure , come on . We 'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything .
HILDY: I have a lunch date . I just want
BURNS: You can break it , ca n't you ?
HILDY: No , I ca n't .
BURNS: Sure you can . Come on .
HILDY: Do n't tell me what to do ! We 're divorced I 'm a free woman . You 're not my husband and you 're not my oss ! And what 's more , you 're not going to be my boss .
BURNS: What do you mean by that ?
HILDY: Just what I said . That 's what I
BURNS: You mean you 're not coming back to work here ?
HILDY: That 's the first time you 've been ight today . That 's what I
BURNS: You 've had a better offer , eh ?
HILDY: You bet I 've got a better offer .
BURNS: Well , go on and take it . Work fo somebody else ! That 's the gratitude I get for
HILDY: I know , Walter , but I
BURNS: What were you when you came here five years ago ? A little college girl from a School of Journalism ! I took a little doll-faced mugg
HILDY: You would n't have taken me if I had n't een doll-faced !
BURNS: Why should I ? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering .
HILDY: Listen , Walter
BURNS: I made a great reporter out of you , Hildy , but you wo n't be half as good on any other paper , and you know it . You need me and I need you and the paper needs both of us .
HILDY: Well , the paper 'll have to learn to do without me . And so will you . It just did n't work out , Walter .
BURNS: It would have worked if you 'd been satisfied with just being editor and eporter . But no ! You had to marry me and spoil everything .
HILDY: I was n't satisfied ! I suppose I proposed to you !
BURNS: Well , you practically did ! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down . And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed . If you 'd been a gentleman you 'd have forgotten all about it . But not you !
HILDY: You you
BURNS: You 're losing your eye . You used to e able to pitch better than that . Hello Yeah What ? Sweeney ? Well , what can I do for you ?
DUFFY: What 's the matter with you ? Are you drunk ? This is Duffy , not Sweeney !
BURNS: Sweeney ! You ca n't do that to me ! Not today , of all days ! Jumping Jehosophat ! Oh , no , Sweeney Well , I suppose so All right . If you have to , you have to . How do you like that ? Everything happens to me with 365 days in the year this has to be the day .
HILDY: What 's the matter ?
BURNS: Sweeney .
HILDY: Dead ?
BURNS: Not yet . Might just as well be . The only man on the paper who can write and his wife picks this morning to have a baby !
HILDY: Sweeney ? Well , after all , he did n't do it on purpose , did he ?
BURNS: I do n't care whether he did or not . He 's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is waiting at the hospital ! Is there no sense of honor left in this country ?
HILDY: Well , have n't you got anybody else ?
BURNS: There 's nobody else on the paper who can write ! This 'll break me , unless Hildy !
HILDY: No !
BURNS: You 've got to help me , Hildy .
HILDY: Keep away
BURNS: It 'll bring us together again , Hildy just the way we used to be .
HILDY: That 's what I 'm afraid of . `` Any time any place anywhere ! ''
BURNS: Do n't mock , Hildy , this is bigge than anything that 's happened to us . Do n't do it for me ! Do it for the paper .
HILDY: Get away , Svengali .
BURNS: If you wo n't do it for love , how about money ? Forget the other offe and I 'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week .
HILDY: Listen , you bumble-headed baboon
BURNS: All right thirty-five , and not a cent more !
HILDY: Please ! Will you just
BURNS: Great grief ! What 's that other pape going to give you ?
HILDY: I 'm not working for any other paper !
BURNS: Oh ! In that case , the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it . Trying to blackjack
HILDY: Look at this !
HILDY: Do you see this ? Do you know what an engagement ring is ?
HILDY: I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing . I 'm getting married , Walter , and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get ! I 'm through .
BURNS: Get married all you want to , Hildy , ut you ca n't quit the newspape usiness .
HILDY: You ca n't sell me that , Walter .
BURNS: Who says I ca n't ? You 're a newspape man .
HILDY: That 's why I 'm quitting . I want to go some place where I can be a woman .
BURNS: I know you , Hildy , and I know what it would mean . It would kill you .
HILDY: A journalist ! Peeking through keyholes unning after fire engines waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler 's going to start a war stealing pictures off old ladies of thei daughters that got chased by apemen ! I know all about reporters a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets , and for what ? So a million hired girls and motormen 's wives will know what 's going on ! No , Walter , I 'm through .
BURNS: Where 'd you meet this man ?
HILDY: Bermuda .
BURNS: Bermuda Rich , eh ?
HILDY: Not what you 'd call rich . Makes about five thousand a year .
BURNS: What 's his line ?
HILDY: He 's in the insurance business .
BURNS: The insurance business ?
HILDY: It 's a good , honest business , is n't it ?
BURNS: Oh sure , it 's honest . But somehow , I ca n't picture you with a guy who sells policies .
HILDY: Well , I can , and I love it ! He forgets the office when he 's with me . He does n't treat me like an errand-boy he treats me like a woman .
BURNS: He does , does he ? How did I treat you like a water buffalo ?
HILDY: I do n't know about water buffaloes , ut I know about him . He 's kind and sweet and considerate . He wants a home and children .
BURNS: Say , sounds more like a guy I ought to marry . What 's his name ?
HILDY: Well , I 'll give you a hint . By tomorrow they 'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin .
BURNS: Tomorrow ? Tomorrow as quick as that ?
HILDY: The quicker the better . Well I finally got out what I came in to tell you . So long , Walter , and better luck next time .
BURNS: I wish you everything I could n't give you , Hildy .
HILDY: Thanks
BURNS: Too bad I could n't see this guy first . I 'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries .
HILDY: Well , he 's waiting in the anteroom for me now .
BURNS: Say , could I meet him ?
HILDY: Oh , better not , Walter . Would n't do any good .
BURNS: You 're not afraid , are you ?
HILDY: Afraid ? I should say not !
BURNS: All right then , come on and let 's see this paragon . Is he as good as you say ?
HILDY: Better .
BURNS: Then what does he want with you ?
HILDY: Now you got me .
BURNS: Nothing personal . I was just asking .
HILDY: You would n't believe this , Walter , ut Bruce holds the door open fo me .
BURNS: No kidding ?
HILDY: And he takes his hat off when he 's with a lady .
BURNS: What for ?
HILDY: And when he walks with a lady , he waits for her !
BURNS: Oh , I 'm sorry .
HILDY: Allow me .
BURNS: Thanks . Hildy follows him out .
MESSENGER: There must be some mistake . I 'm already married .
BURNS: Already married ! Hildy , why did n't you tell me ?
BURNS: Congratulations again , Mr. Baldwin !
MESSENGER: But my name
BRUCE: Mr. Burns !
BURNS: Yeah ? You 'll have to excuse me I 'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here . Just leave your card with the boy .
BRUCE: Mr. Burns
BURNS: I 've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin !
BRUCE: I 'm Bruce Baldwin !
BURNS: You 're Bruce Baldwin ?
BRUCE: Yes !
BURNS: Then who are you ?
MESSENGER: My name 's Pete Davis .
BURNS: Pete Davis ! Well , Mr. Davis , this is no concern of yours and after this I 'll thank you to keep out of my affairs !
BURNS: This is a pleasure , Mr. Baldwin , and I 'm sorry about the mistake .
BURNS: Oh , I thought there was something funny You see , Bruce , you do n't mind if I call you Bruce , do you ? After all , we 're practically related
BRUCE: Mr. well no no not at all .
BURNS: You see , my wife I mean , you wife that is , I mean Hildy had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man .
BRUCE: Oh .
BURNS: But I see , she did n't mean old in years . You always carry an umbrella , Bruce ?
BRUCE: Well , er it looked a little cloudy this morning .
BURNS: That 's right . Rubbers , too , I hope ? A man ought to be prepared fo any emergency .
BRUCE: Where are we going ?
BURNS: Where are we going ? I 'm going to buy you two lunch did n't Hildy tell you ?
BRUCE: No she did n't .
BURNS: Just wanted to surprise you , I guess . Down ! After you , Bruce ! Come on , Hildy , my treat !
HILDY: I suppose I ca n't call this off without creating a scene but emember , it 's your last fling .
BURNS: How do you like that ? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that 's the thanks I get !
WAITER: Do n't tell me it 's you , Hildy !
HILDY: Nobody else .
GUS: I ca n't complain .
BURNS: Well , I can . I 'm hungry . Roast beef sandwich rare . And some coffee .
GUS: Shall I put a little rum in the coffee ? It 's a nasty day .
BURNS: Good idea . How about you , Hildy ?
HILDY: Oh I 'll take the same , I guess . And coffee .
GUS: Little rum in yours , too ?
HILDY: I guess so .
GUS: Just coffee . And you , sir ?
BRUCE: Oh , I 'll take the same , I guess . And a glass of milk .
GUS: Milk ?
BRUCE: Yes .
GUS: Milk .
BURNS: And do n't put any rum in it , Gus .
BRUCE: Feels awful good . Yes , sir we 're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we 'll be married .
BURNS: Taking the train today and being married tomorrow ? He whistles .
BRUCE: Oh , it is n't like that .
HILDY: It will be perfectly all right , Walter . Mother is coming with us on the train .
BURNS: Mother ? But your mother
BRUCE: No . My mother .
BURNS: Oh . Your mother well , of course , that relieves my mind .
HILDY: Is n't it sweet of Walter still wanting to protect me ? She gives Burns that too-sweet look .
BURNS: I know I was n't a good husband , Hildy , ut you can always count on me .
BRUCE: I do n't think she 'll need you very much I aim to do most of the protecting myself . He pats Hildy 's arm she smiles at him .
BURNS: Well , I 'll tell you one thing , old man , she never looked at me the way she 's looking at you .
HILDY: I might have , Walter , but you were never there .
BURNS: Anyway , I 'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I could n't give her . You know , Hildy is about the best reporter in the country and that goes regardless of sex . But all she really ever wanted was a home .
BRUCE: Well , I 'll try to give her one .
BURNS: I know you will , Bruce . Are you going to live with your mother ?
BRUCE: Just for the first year .
BURNS: That 'll be nice . A home with mother . A real honeymoon . In Albany , too . Ow !
BRUCE: Mighty nice little town , Albany . They 've got the State Capitol there , you know .
BURNS: Yes , I know Hildy , will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath ? She did n't even know I was in town
GUS: Well , here we are . He begins serving them .
BURNS: How 's business , Bruce ?
BRUCE: Well , Albany 's a mighty good insurance town . Most people there take it out pretty early in life .
BURNS: I do n't blame them .
HILDY: Oh , I 'm sorry , Gus ! My foot must have slipped .
GUS: That 's all right .
BURNS: I sometimes wish I 'd taken out insurance but , of course , now it does n't matter . Still , I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do .
BRUCE: Well , I honestly feel that way . I figure I 'm in one line of business that really helps people . Of course , we do n't help you much when you 're alive but afterward that 's what counts .
BURNS: I see what you mean . They fall to .
HILDY: Gus , this
GUS: Good coffee , is n't it ?
BRUCE: You 've forgotten my milk .
GUS: Oh . The milk . Yes .
BURNS: Here 's luck to the bride and idegroom .
HILDY: Thank you .
BRUCE: He has n't brought my milk yet .
BUS BOY: They want you on the phone , Mr. Burns .
BURNS: They would !
BRUCE: You know , Hildy , he 's not a bad fellow .
HILDY: You 're so nice , Bruce , you think everybody else is .
BRUCE: Oh , he 's not the man for you . I can see that . But I sort of like him . Got a lot of charm .
HILDY: He comes by it naturally . His grandfather was a snake .
BRUCE: If anybody had told me I 'd be sitting at lunch with him but he swept me ight off my feet .
HILDY: That 's what he did to me . Swept me ight off my feet and left me lying on the floor .
BURNS: Get this get Sweeney off that yarn and out of town on a two weeks ' vacation and right away All ight , Duffy , keep your shirt on . Hildy 's coming back No . She does n't know it yet . But she 'll be there . I promise you , Duffy . And tell Louie to stick around .
GUS: Your milk , sir . He serves Bruce .
HILDY: Thanks , Gus . She takes a sip and almost chokes .
BRUCE: Too hot ?
HILDY: No . It 's strong . But I like it that way . Gus goes , smiling .
BRUCE: Say , what 's happened to Burns ? He looks sunk , does n't he ?
HILDY: He certainly hic does !
BRUCE: Anything the matter ?
BURNS: Just Sweeney again . One of my best eporters .
HILDY: What now ?
BURNS: His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord . They ca n't even find him . I tell you , drink is the ruin of this nation .
HILDY: You said it .
BURNS: So Sweeney gets twins and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow .
BRUCE: Just what is the lowdown on Williams ?
BURNS: It 's simple . A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down .
HILDY: If he 's nuts , why does n't the State just put him away ?
BURNS: Because it happened to be a colored policeman .
HILDY: The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town .
BURNS: Especially with an election coming up in a few days .
BRUCE: Are you sure Williams is not all there ?
BURNS: All you 've got to do is talk to him . But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected .
BRUCE: But could n't you show the man was n't esponsible ?
BURNS: How ?
HILDY'S VOICE: You could run an interview that would prove it . Remember the interview I wrote with Jimmy Wellman ? That saved his life .
BURNS: Yes , you could do it , Hildy . You could save that poor devil 's life . You could but you 're going away . I forgot .
BRUCE: How long would the interview take ?
BURNS: Oh an hour for the interview . Another hour to write it .
BRUCE: We could take the six o'clock train , Hildy . If it would save a man 's life .
HILDY: No , Bruce , dear . Do n't you see ? This is a trick to get your sympathy . No , Walter , I 've been waiting fo something like this but I was n't sure when you 'd spring it . If you want to save Earl Williams ' life , you can interview him yourself . You 're still a good reporter . Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train and thanks just the same .
BURNS: I 'm an editor . I know what ought to e written , but I ca n't write it the way you could . It needs a woman 's heart
HILDY: Why , Walter , you 're getting poetic !
BURNS: You see what I had to put up with ? She never trusted me ! You argue with her otherwise you 're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands ! Bruce gulps .
HILDY: What a performance ! Bravo ! Do n't let him fool you , Bruce it 's only an act !
BURNS: What do you mean , only an act ? Have n't you got any feeling ?
HILDY: Well , it 's either an act on you part or a miracle on Sweeney 's .
BURNS: What do you mean ?
HILDY: I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago . If he 's got twins this morning , I claim it was done with mirrors .
BURNS: All right , Hildy , I 'm licked . But I 'll make you and Bruce a business proposition .
HILDY: We 're not interested .
BURNS: Maybe you 'll be . You 're a smart young man . You let Hildy do this story fo me and you can write out a $ 100,000.00 insurance policy for me . What do you say ?
BRUCE: I do n't use my wife for business purposes , Mr. Burns !
HILDY: Wait a minute , Bruce . What 's commission on a $ 100,000.00 policy ?
BRUCE: Well , at his age , twenty payment life , a little over a thousand dollars .
HILDY: And what 's the matter with a thousand dollars ?
BRUCE: But
HILDY: According to the budget , we laid out that 's more than our food bill for a whole year . Listen , Bruce , I do n't want Walter Burns to use me , but I 'm perfectly willing to use him . How long will it take to get him examined ?
BRUCE: I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes .
BURNS: Now you 're talking !
HILDY: You keep out of this . Bruce , suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office . I 'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building . You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check . Then I 'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we 're taking the six o'clock train . And no tricks , Walter !
BURNS: What tricks would I pull ?
HILDY: Oh , nothing ! Of course , you might cancel the check . Yes ! Wait a minute ! What would be his first payment on that policy ?
BRUCE: About twenty-five hundred dollars .
HILDY: Better make that a certified check , Walter .
BURNS: What do you think I am a crook ?
HILDY: Yes - and that 's putting it mildly ! No certified check no story Get me ?
BURNS: All right . The check will be certified . Want my fingerprints ?
HILDY: No thanks , I 've still got those . Well , I 'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn . It 'll be kind of fun to see the boys again , too . Remember , Bruce , it must e certified .
BRUCE: All right , dear .
HILDY: Wait a minute , Bruce . Have you got that money ?
BRUCE: The five hundred ? Sure .
HILDY: On second thought , would you let me have it ? I 'll get the tickets .
BRUCE: But
HILDY: Believe me , Bruce , I know what I 'm doing . He 'd get you in a crap game
BRUCE: But I do n't gamble , Hilda !
HILDY: I know a lot of men who did n't do anything till they met Walter Burns . Please , dear .
BRUCE: All right . One two three four five . Five hundred . Be careful , honey .
HILDY: I 'll be careful , darling . You be , please .
BRUCE: I never knew Hildy to be so determined efore .
BURNS: You have n't seen anything yet .
ENDICOTT: Criminal Courts Press Room This is Endicott No , nothing new on the Williams case yet boss . Well , you bet I 'm here plugging away every minute . Up a dime .
MURPHY: By me .
WILSON: Droparoo . Schwartz knocks on table and drops cards .
MCCUE: I 'll call .
ENDICOTT: Three sixes . Is that any good ?
HILDY'S VOICE: It sure looks good from here .
HILDY: One at a time , boys .
ENDICOTT: Well , that about covers everything .
HILDY: Good . Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions . Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun ?
MURPHY: If you ask us , no . If you ask the state alienists , the answer is yes .
MCCUE: It 's a simple story . Earl Williams works for the E.J . McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeepe for fourteen years . He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty . A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job . Take it away , Fred Wilson !
WILSON: Well Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he 's got to save the world . Only he makes his speeches , usually , on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it . Well , the cops let him alone as much as they can because he 's harmless and they 're kinda sorry for him . But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran 's Parade and the cops chase him . He gets scared and goes into hiding . Come in , Dave Schwartz .
SCHWARTZ: His Honor , the Mayor , now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive . Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy 's joint . And this colored policeman , Daniels , goes over to pick Williams up . Williams has read the papers , thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first . That is all .
HILDY: Thanks , boys . That 's all I want to know .
ENDICOTT: Say , that 's old Prissy Bensinger 's desk .
HILDY: I know , I just want to give him a thrill . Hildy crosses back to desk and sits down .
BURNS: Hello , my fine-feathered friend . Thought I might be hearing from you . What have you got to report ?
DOCTOR: Fine .
BURNS: Doctor , will you please keep quiet a minute ? How do you expect me to get any work done ?
DOCTOR: How do you expect me to get anywhere if you 're going to keep on that phone ? If you 'll just give me two minutes more
BURNS: Well , they have n't finished with me yet but I 'm hoping to get my shirt ack . Oh , no . I 'm in the pink of condition . They found two new dimples .
HILDY: How about that check ? All right , Mr. Burns , but remember , no checkee no story . Well , as soon as they decide whether you live or not will you have that new man of mine call me up ? Yes , sir . All right , boys . Up a dime .
ENDICOTT'S VOICE: Right back at you .
MCCUE: You fight it cut .
HILDY: And up a dime .
ENDICOTT: I call . What you got ?
HILDY: Three bullets ! Any good ?
ENDICOTT: Beats king up . Hildy rakes in the money .
MCCUE: What are you going to do with all that money , Hildy ?
WILSON: Yeah you ca n't spend it in Albany .
HILDY: Oh , I 'll think of something .
MURPHY: Hello , Harvard ! Got anything new on the hanging ?
BENSINGER: Why do n't you fellows get your own news ?
HILDY: Ca n't you say 'hello ' to a fellow ?
BENSINGER: Hildy ! He comes over to shake hands .
HILDY: No , just a farewell appearance , atting for Sweeney . I 'm going into usiness for myself .
BENSINGER: What doing ?
HILDY: I 'm getting married tomorrow .
BENSINGER: Well , congratulations ! Good luck !
ENDICOTT: Why do n't you use him for a idesmaid , Hildy ?
SCHWARTZ: Come on , Hildy , your deal .
BENSINGER: Say , who put these stockings in my desk ?
ENDICOTT: Why ca n't they hang that guy at a easonable hour , so we can get some sleep ?
BENSINGER: Jake , new lead on the hanging . This new alienist from New York Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer is going to interview Williams in about half an hour in the Sheriff 's office .
MURPHY: That must be the tenth alienist they 've had on Williams . Even if he was n't crazy before , he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him . Gim me the desk .
ENDICOTT: This Egelhoffer 's pretty good .
MURPHY: Yeah ? What did he ever do for his country ?
ENDICOTT: Do n't you remember ? He 's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust , and gave out a statement that they were all sane . It created a sensation !
BENSINGER: Here 's the situation on the eve of the hanging
MURPHY: This is Murphy . More slop on the hanging .
BENSINGER: A double guard 's been thrown around the jail , municipal buildings , ailroad terminals , and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution .
MURPHY: Ready ? The Sheriff 's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes . Up a dime .
BENSINGER: The Sheriff has just received fou more letters threatening his life , ut he says nothing can interfere with his duty .
MURPHY: And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level , the Sheriff has written himself fou more letters , threatening his life . I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings .
ENDICOTT: Trouble is , when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf ! '
MURPHY: What have you got , Hildy ?
HILDY: Kings and sixes .
MURPHY: That 's good .
HILDY: 'Kings and sixes The pot affixes ' Poetry . I learned that at my grandma 's knee .
WILSON: That 's why I keep losing . My grandma was a modest woman nobody eve saw her knees , not even my grandpop .
BRUCE: I do n't know . This makes me feel funny .
BURNS: Why should n't I make Hildy my eneficiary ? I 've got nobody else to leave it to .
BRUCE: I feel I ought to take care of her .
BURNS: Well , you 'll take care of her . Afte all , if that doctor 's right , I 'm going to live for a long time yet . Look , Bruce , this is a debt of honor . I was a very bad husband Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she 'd wanted to , but she would n't take any . She had it coming to her , but she was too independent .
BRUCE: Well , I 'm independent , too .
BURNS: Figure it this way I ought to be good for twenty-five years . By that time , you 'll probably have made enough so that the money wo n't mean anything . But suppose you have n't made good do n't you think Hildy 's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries ?
BRUCE: Well , of course , if you put it that way .
BURNS: And remember this , Bruce ! I love her , too .
BRUCE: I 'm beginning to realize that .
BURNS: And the beauty of it is she 'll neve have to know 'till I 've passed on . Maybe she 'll think kindly of me - after I 'm gone .
BRUCE: Gee , you almost make me feel like a heel coming between you .
BURNS: No , Bruce , you did n't come between us . It was all over for her before you came on the scene . For me it 'll never be over .
DUFFY: Here 's that certified check , Walter . I drew out my wife 's savings , and if this is n't back by 5 30 I 'm a ruined man !
BURNS: Do n't worry , Duffy , you 'll have it ack by five . Thanks , Duffy . Stick around . He walks over to Bruce .
BRUCE: Certified ! I 'm afraid Hildy 'd feel ashamed to think she had n't trusted you .
BRUCE: Well , she 'll know some day .
BURNS: That 's all I ask . Oh , wait a minute .
BRUCE: Thanks . I 'll phone Hildy right away to get that story .
BURNS: Well , anyway , I know Hildy 's getting a good man .
BRUCE: Thanks a lot . They pass Louis . He looks up .
BURNS: Well , I got to get back . You can find your way out , ca n't you ?
BRUCE: Oh , sure . Well , thanks for everything .
BURNS: Do n't thank me . I should thank you . So long .
BRUCE: So long . He turns and goes . Burns watches him .
HILDY: I do n't know why you boys are so good to me .
MCCUE: Your poker 's improved a lot , Hildy . Lend me two bucks , will you ?
HILDY: Nothing doing . I 'm playing for keeps .
BENSINGER: I wish they 'd stop that practicing .
HILDY: Well , anyhow , I wo n't be covering stuff like this any more .
SCHWARTZ: What 's the matter ? Getting yellow ?
MCCUE: For you , Hildy . Hildy goes toward phone .
HILDY: Hildy Johnson Oh , hello , Bruce . Have you got it ? Is it certified ?
BRUCE: Certified and everything . Got it ight here in my wallet What ? No , he 's not here I 'm in a phone booth .
MCCUE: Certified , eh ? Who is it you milkman ?
HILDY: But , Bruce , do n't keep it in you wallet ! Well , you see there 's an old newspape superstition that the first big check you get you you put in the lining of your hat . That brings you good luck for ten years .
MCCUE: Say , I 've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that . Where 'd you get it ?
HILDY: I made it up just now , and who 's asking you ? I know it 's silly , honey , but do it for me , wo n't you ? Yes , right now .
BRUCE: All right . Wait a minute .
HILDY: Fine . And here 's a kiss for you .
COOLEY: Hello , Hildy ! What are you doing around here ?
HILDY: I want to interview Earl Williams , Warden . How about a little service ?
COOLEY: No more interviews . Besides , a doctor 's coming over .
HILDY: Say , is n't this your twenty dollars ?
COOLEY: I think it is .
HILDY: I thought so . Come on , I 'm in a hurry .
COP: What 's going on ?
LOUIS: This guy stole my watch .
COP: Have you got his watch ?
BRUCE: He 's crazy . I have n't any watch .
LOUIS: I saw him . He put it in his back pocket .
BRUCE: I have n't got
COP: Wait a minute .
LOUIS: Yeah ! That 's it !
COP: What about it ?
BRUCE: I never saw it before . Cop grabs Bruce . Louis grabs his other arm .
COP: Come on ! He whistles .
BRUCE: My hat !
COP: Get his hat , somebody .
WILLIAMS: I could n't plead insanity , because you see I 'm just as sane as anybody else .
HILDY: You did n't mean to kill that policeman ?
WILLIAMS: Of course not . I could n't kill anybody it 's against everything I 've eve stood for . They know it was an accident . They 're not hanging me fo that they 're hanging me for my eliefs .
HILDY: What are your beliefs , Earl ?
WILLIAMS: They 're very simple . I believe in the Golden Rule . I 'm not the first man to die for preaching it . But if they would only listen to it we could have a fine , decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things .
HILDY: How would you go about applying the Golden Rule , Earl ?
WILLIAMS: I 'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only . There 's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we 'd use some sense .
HILDY: `` Production for use only . '' Well , maybe that 's the answer .
WILLIAMS: It 's the only answer . Everything has a use and if we let it be used fo its purpose , we could solve all ou problems . Food was meant to be eaten , not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved ; clothing was meant to be worn , not piled up in stores while people went naked . Does n't that make sense ?
HILDY: Yes , that makes a lot of sense , Earl .
WILLIAM'S VOICE: Just use things for what they were meant , that 's all .
HILDY: Sure . What 's the purpose of a gun , Earl ?
WILLIAMS: A gun ? Why to shoot , of course .
HILDY: Is that how you came to shoot the policeman ?
WILLIAMS: Sure . You see , I 'd never had a gun in my hand before and I did n't know what to do with it . Well , when I get stuck , I know that there 's an answe for everything in production fo use . So it came to me in a flash what 's a gun for ? To shoot ! So I shot . Simple is n't it ?
HILDY: Very simple , Earl .
WILLIAMS: There 's nothing crazy about that , is there ?
HILDY: No , Earl , not at all . Who sent you the flowers , Earl ?
WILLIAMS: Miss Mollie Malloy . She 's a wonderful person .
HILDY: Is n't that her picture ?
WILLIAMS: Yes . Is n't she beautiful ?
HILDY'S VOICE: If you should be pardoned , are you figuring on marrying Mollie ?
EARL'S VOICE: Oh , no , she 's much too good for me .
HARTMAN'S VOICE: How 'd you get in here ?
HILDY: Same way you did . Through that gate .
HARTMAN: I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission .
HILDY: All right , then , I 'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner . Of course , with election coming , that might do you a lot of harm , but just as you say .
HARTMAN: Now , wait a minute ! I 'm not afraid of anything . What were you going to write about Williams ?
HILDY: Oh , nothing much . Just that the state had proved he was sane and he admits it himself . If you do n't want me to run it
HARTMAN: Oh , that 'll be all right , Hildy . Go ahead , run it . And you can say I treated him well , too . 'Lo , Earl . How are you feeling ?
WILLIAMS: Fine , thanks , Sheriff .
HARTMAN: That 's good , Earl . Oh , they 've got another alienist to see you . He ought to be here any minute . Do n't go to sleep , will you ?
WILLIAMS: I wo n't .
HARTMAN: Hildy , how 'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging ?
HILDY: No , thanks Sheriff . I 'm leaving town tonight .
HARTMAN: You ought to stay over . You always wrote a good hanging story , Hildy .
HILDY: That 's awful kind of you , Sheriff . I 've got to get started on my interview . See you later .
WILLIAMS: Do n't forget about production fo use .
HILDY: I wo n't , Earl .
MURPHY: Well , a guy can win when Hildy ai n't around .
ENDICOTT: Who 's this guy she 's gon na marry ?
WILSON: Baldwin his name is .
SCHWARTZ: I give that marriage six months .
MCCUE: Why ?
SCHWARTZ: Hildy wo n't be able to stay away from a paper any longer than that . Did you see her eyes light up when she came in here ? Like an old fire horse .
MURPHY: She says she 's gon na write fiction .
ENDICOTT: Well , if she 's gon na write fiction , there 's nothing like being a reporter .
SCHWARTZ: I 'll give ten to five that marriage wo n't last six months . Hildy 's a newspaper man . She 's got headlines in her veins the way we all have or we 'd be out of these lousy jobs .
MCCUE: Well , well Miss Mollie Malloy .
MURPHY: Hello , Mollie .
WILSON: How 's tricks , Mollie ?
MOLLIE: I 've been lookin ' for you tramps .
ENDICOTT: Kid , those were pretty roses you sent Earl . What do you want done with them tomorrow morning ?
MOLLIE: A lot of wise guys , ai n't you ?
SCHWARTZ: You 're breaking up the game , Mollie . What do you want ?
MOLLIE: I want to tell you what I think of you all of you .
MURPHY: Keep your shirt on .
MOLLIE: If you was worth breaking my fingers on , I 'd tear your face wide open . Hildy goes to desk and begins typing away .
MURPHY: What are you sore about , sweetheart ? Was n't that a swell story we gave you ?
MOLLIE: You crumbs have been making a fool out of me long enough !
BENSINGER: She ought n't be allowed in here !
MOLLIE: I never said I loved Earl Williams and was willing to marry him on the gallows ! You made that up ! And about my being his soul-mate and having a love-nest with him .
ENDICOTT: You 've been sucking around that cuckoo ever since he 's been in the death- house . Everybody knows you 're his sweetheart .
MOLLIE: That 's a lie ! I met Mr. Williams just once in my life when he was wandering around in the rain without his hat and coat on , like a sick dog , the day before the shooting . I went up to him like any human being would and I asked him what was the matter , and he told me about being fired after working at the same place for fourteen years , and I brought him up to my room because it was warm there .
MURPHY'S VOICE: Aw , put it on a phonograph !
MOLLIE: Just because you want to fill you lying paper with a lot of dirty scandal , you got to crucify him and make a stooge out of me !
ENDICOTT: Got a match ?
MOLLIE: I tell you he just sat there talking to me all night . And never once laid a hand on me . In the morning he went away , and I never saw him again till that day at the trial ! The boys laugh .
MOLLIE: Go on , laugh ! I 'd like to know some curses bad enough for your greasy souls ! Sure , I was his witness the only one he had . Yes me cheap little Mollie Malloy ! I 'm everything the District Attorney said I was . And still I was the only one with guts enough to stand up fo him ! I told the truth and the District Attorney knows it ! That 's why you 're persecutin ' me ! Because Earl Williams treated me decent and not like an animal and I said so !
MURPHY: Go into your dance ! This is the Press Room . We 're busy .
WILSON: Why do n't you go and see your boy- friend ?
ENDICOTT: But you 'll have to hurry up he left a call for seven A.M .
MOLLIE: It 's a wonder a bolt of lightning do n't come down and strike you all dead !
ENDICOTT: Do n't get hysterical , kid .
MOLLIE: Shame on you !
MURPHY'S VOICE: If you do n't shut up , we 'll give you something to cry about ! Hildy looks o.s . and rises determinedly .
HILDY: Come on , Mollie . This is no place for you .
MOLLIE: They 're not human !
HILDY: They 're newspaper men , Mollie . They ca n't help themselves . The Lord made them that way .
MOLLIE: It was n't the Lord ! It was the devil !
MURPHY: You guys wan na play some more poker ?
ENDICOTT: What 's the use ? I ca n't win a pot .
WILSON: Who ? Hildy Johnson ? She just stepped out . She 'll be back in a second . Who ? Oh , Mr. Baldwin . Well , if you 'll hang on a minute , she ought to be ight in . All right .
SCHWARTZ: What 's he want ?
WILSON: Wants Hildy and sounds very excited .
HILDY: Gentlemen of the Press ! Always picking on somebody who ca n't defend himself the littler the better .
WILSON: Phone for you , Hildy .
HILDY: Who is it ?
WILSON: Oh , some insurance man . Are you in ?
HILDY: Give me that !
HILDY: Hello ! Hello ! Bruce ? what ? Where are you ? You 're where ? How did that happen ? I 'll be right over !
MURPHY: Boy , did you see her go ?
ENDICOTT: Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub .
WILSON: I told you Baldwin was in trouble .
MCCUE: Probably went out without his hankie and wants Mamma to wipe his nose .
SCHWARTZ: I still give that marriage six months .
BENSINGER: Hello , baby , get me the Sheriff 's offico , will you Hello , Sheriff Hartman ? This is Bensinger . How about that favor ? You know what once and for all , will you hang this guy at five A.M. instead of seven ? It wo n't hurt you and we can make the City Edition .
HARTMAN: Once and for all , I 'm not going to hang anybody except at the legal hour What ? Do n't threaten me , Bensinger ! I 'm not afraid of any newspapers . Yeah ? Oh , shut up ! And , operator , I told you not to disturb me ! I do n't care who calls I do n't want to be disturbed again till I tell you ! How do you like that , Dr. Egelhoffer ? Want me to hang williams at thei convenience !
EGELHOFFER: The newspapers ! Sheriff , they 're the scum of modern civilization .
HARTMAN: You said it !
EGELHOFFER: They 're always after me fo interviews .
HARTMAN: Me , too .
EGELHOFFER: Of course , I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here . You do n't mind ?
HARTMAN: Well , I do n't know if that 's ethical . You see , all statements are supposed to come from me .
EGELHOFFER: We 'll have to satisfy them . What would you say to giving them a joint interview ? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects .
HARTMAN: A joint interview , eh ? That might be all right . We could have our pictures taken together , Doctor .
EGELHOFFER: Yes , shaking hands . I do n't take a very good picture , though .
HARTMAN: It does n't matter . The publicity 's the main thing .
EGELHOFFER: Yes , I suppose so . It all helps .
WILLIAMS: Are you gentlemen all through with me ?
EGELHOFFER: Oh , I 'm sorry . I forgot you were here . No , Mr. Williams , we still have some questions for you . Sheriff , will you kindly extinguish the lights ?
WILLIAMS: The system . But I 'm not afraid to die , Doctor . I 'm dying for what I elieve .
EGELHOFFER: I see . You realize , however , that you committed a crime ?
WILLIAMS: In a legal sense , yes . But not actually . Actually , I 'm innocent . I did n't do anything .
BRUCE: I 'm innocent . I did n't do anything . I never stole a watch in my life .
HILDY: I know you did n't , Bruce . She whirls on lieutenant .
LIEUTENANT: But , Hildy , I ca n't . He 's accused of stealing a watch . And they found the watch on him .
HILDY: And who accused him ? Diamond Louis ! One of the worst crooks in town ! Why do n't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames ?
LIEUTENANT: Now , Hildy
HILDY: Do n't Hildy me ! Are you going to let him out ?
LIEUTENANT: I ca n't .
HILDY: All right . You ca n't . But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that oulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs . And we 'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it !
LIEUTENANT: Now , Hildy , do n't be hasty ! I ca n't let him out .
HILDY: You can let him out on bail , ca n't you ?
LIEUTENANT: Five hundred dollars .
HILDY: You 'll take fifty and like it !
LIEUTENANT: Well , all right . But I 'm liable to get into a jam . He starts to open cell door .
HILDY: You 'll get into a worse one if you do n't .
BRUCE: I lost my wallet .
HILDY: The check , Bruce !
BRUCE: That 's right here . Gee , it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition .
HILDY: Yes , was n't it ?
BRUCE: I ca n't imagine who did it . I ca n't think of any enemies I have .
HILDY: I 'm sure you have n't any .
BRUCE: For a minute , I thought maybe Walte Burns was at the back of it . But then I realized he could n't have een .
HILDY: Oh , no . How could you ever think of such a thing ?
BRUCE: Oh , I realized right away . He 's really a very nice fellow , Hildy I found that out .
HILDY: Yes , he is Look , Bruce , we 're taking that next train and when I say next train , this time I mean it !
BRUCE: Did you finish the interview ?
HILDY: The Criminal Courts Building . The driver nods .
BRUCE: But , gee , Hildy he gave us that insurance business and you promised
HILDY: Well , the story 's practically finished . I 'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger .
SCHWARTZ: `` But the State has a production fo use plan , too . It has a gallows and at seven A.M. , unless a miracle occurs , that gallows will be used to separate the soul of Earl Williams from his body . And out of Molly Malloy 's life will go the one kindly soul she ever knew `` That 's as far as Hildy got . But , I ask you , can that girl write an interview ?
BENSINGER: I do n't think it 's very ethical eading other people 's stuff .
ENDICOTT: Do n't give us that ethics stuff . You 'll be the only one who 'll swipe any of it .
SCHWARTZ: I still say anybody that writes like that ai n't going to give it up permanently to sew sox for a guy in the insurance business . Now I give that marriage three months and I 'm laying three to one . Any takers ?
HILDY'S VOICE: I 'll take that bet . They turn . Hildy comes into the scene .
HILDY: It 's getting so a girl ca n't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies . Hello , Post Mr. Walter Burns , please .
SCHWARTZ: Well , Hildy , we were only saying that a swell reporter like you would n't give this up so easily .
HILDY: This is Hildy Johnson Oh , I can give it up all right . Without a single quiver . I 'm going to live like a human being not like you rats . Oh , is that you , Walter dear ? Oh , I did n't mean `` dear . '' That was just habit , I guess . Oh , be yourself , Walter . I 've got some news for you Yes , I got the interview , but I 've got some news that 's more important . The others are listening , suspecting a scoop .
HILDY: And I just want you to listen to one more thing .
SCHWARTZ: Hello , Mr. Burns . Yes , she 's still here .
HILDY: I 'll take it . What 's the matter , Mr. Burns do n't you understand English ? Why , you language is shocking , Mr. Burns positively shocking ! I do n't mind ecause I was married to you and know what to expect , but suppose Central is listening in Oh , did you hear that , Central ? We ought to eport him , do n't you think ? Oh , fooey on you !
WILLIAMS: I hope you 're pretty nearly through with me , Doctor , I 'm getting a little fatigued .
HARTMAN: Yeah , you do n't want to tire him out , Doctor .
EGELHOFFER: Just one thing more . I 'd like to eenact the crime , Mr. Williams . May I have your gun , please , Sheriff ? Hartman starts to take gun out , hesitates .
HARTMAN: I do n't know
EGELHOFFER: Come , come , Sheriff , lightning does n't strike in the same place twice . Nothing 's going to happen . Hartman hands him the gun .
WILLIAMS: Yes , sir .
EGELHOFFER: So now I say to you 'Earl Williams , you are under arrest ! ' and you point your gun at me .
WILLIAMS: Well , it was n't exactly that way
EGELHOFFER: Point the gun at me ! Williams does so .
WILLIAMS: Now can I go , please ?
VOICE: Hey , Sheriff ! Open up ! What happened ?
ENDICOTT: Goodbye , Yonson .
MCCUE: So long , Hildy .
MURPHY: Send us a postcard , kid .
SCHWARTZ: Who 'll keep the lamp in the window for you .
BENSINGER: Goodbye , Hildy .
HILDY: Well , goodbye , you wage-slaves . When you 're crawling up fire escapes , getting kicked out of front doors , and eating Christmas dinners in one- armed joints , do n't forget your pal , Hildy Johnson ! And , remember , my husband sells insurance ! She turns and starts on a bit of verse
WILSON: There 's a jail-break !
MURPHY: Cooley ! What 's the matter What 's happened ?
ENDICOTT: Who got away ? Who was it ?
VOICE OUTSIDE: Earl Williams ! ! !
THE REPORTERS: Who ? Who 'd he say ? Earl Williams ! It was Earl Williams ! He got away ! Etc .
MCCUE: Holy - ! Gim me that telephone ! Hurry ! Hurry up ! This is important !
MURPHY: Look out where you 're aiming , will you ?
HILDY: Ahhh
HILDY: Cooley , I want to talk to you .
COOLEY: Hildy I ca n't . I 'm busy I Let me up , Hildy . Earl Williams has escaped He struggles .
HILDY: There 's money in it , Cooley .
COOLEY: I ca n't Hildy . It means my job ! It means
HILDY: A lot of money . Four hundred and fifty dollars She fingers the bills .
COOLEY: How much ?
HILDY: Four hundred and fifty dollars . Is it a deal ?
COOLEY: It 's a deal . Let me up . Cooley gets up and dusts himself off .
HILDY: First we talk . How did Earl Williams get that gun ? Cooley looks around quickly .
COOLEY: Come on , and I 'll tell you .
ENDICOTT: Endicott talking .
MURPHY'S VOICE: Gim me the Desk .
ENDICOTT: No , I tell you ! Nobody knows where he got it .
MURPHY: The Crime Commission has offered a eward of ten thousand dollars fo Williams ' capture .
ENDICOTT: Call you back . He hangs up swiftly and goes out .
MURPHY: No clue yet as to Earl Williams ' whereabouts . Here 's a little feature though There 's been an accident about a tear bomb Wilson enters and picks up his phone .
WILSON: Wilson talking .
MURPHY: Yeah tear bomb . Criminals cry fo it .
HARTMAN: If the Mayor wants me , he knows where I am .
MURPHY: This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman 's Bombing Squad .
HARTMAN: What went off ?
MURPHY: Four of Mr. Hartman 's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital
HARTMAN: A fine fair-weather friend you are !
MURPHY: The names are Merwyn D. Mayor , who is the Mayor 's brother-in-law
HARTMAN: After all I 've done for you
MURPHY: Howard Shenken , the Sheriff 's uncle on his mother 's side
WILSON: Hello , Jim ? Sidelights on Sheriff Hartman 's manhunt .
MURPHY: William Lungren , who is the Sheriff 's landlord , and Lester Bartow who married the Sheriff 's niece . You emember , the very homely dame . Call you back . He hangs up .
WILSON: Mrs. William Tausig , age fifty-five , scrub lady , while at work scrubbing the eighth floor of the Commerce Building , was shot in the left leg y one of Sheriff Hartman 's deputies .
HILDY: There goes another scrub lady .
WILSON: I 'll go right after it . He hangs up and exits .
MURPHY: Any dope yet on how he got out ?
HILDY: From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so 's he could vote for him .
HARTMAN: I 'm very disappointed in you , Hildy Johnson . He turns and exits .
MURPHY: How do you suppose Williams got that gun ?
HILDY: Give me Walter Burns quick
BURNS: Exclusive ? That 's great .
HILDY: It cost me four hundred and fifty ucks to tear it out of Cooley .
BURNS: Never mind that . What 's the story ?
HILDY: Never mind it ? That 's not my money ! That 's Bruce 's money !
BURNS: You 'll get it . Now what 's the story ? I 'll have the paper send the money ight down to you . I swear it on my mother 's grave .
HILDY: Wait a minute . Your mother 's alive .
BURNS: I meant on my grandmother 's grave . Do n't be so technical , Hildy . What 's the story ? !
HILDY: Well , this expert Dr. Egelhoffer , from New York , decides to make Williams re-enact the crime She starts to giggle at the thought .
BURNS: No kidding , Hildy . Say , this is n't a rib ?
HILDY: No , this is on the level , Walter . I 'm not good enough to make this one up . The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor , the Professor gave it to Earl , and Earl gave it right back to the Professor right in the stomach ! Who ? No , Egelhoffer was n't hurt badly . They took him to the County Hospital where they 're afraid he 'll recover .
BURNS: That 's great work , Hildy Huh ? Oh , will you stop worrying about the money ? I 'll see you get it in fifteen minutes .
HILDY: It better be fifteen minutes , because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter 's clicking away to beat the band .
BURNS: Hold on a minute .
BLONDE: I 've never flopped on you , have I ?
BURNS: Then scram ! You 've got about two minutes . She exits .
LOUIS: It 's awful funny I happen to have some on me .
BURNS: It 's coming right over . I 'm sending it over with Louis . Thanks for the story and good luck on your honeymoon .
HILDY: Keep the thanks , but just see that the money gets here !
MCCUE: Hello , Hildy . I thought you were gone .
HILDY: I thought so , too .
MCCUE: McCue speaking . Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe , eight-sixty-one and a half South State Street , colored , gave birth to a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with Sheriff Hartman 's special Rifle Squad acting as nurses . Well Phoebe was walking along the street when all of a sudden she began that 's right . So the police coaxed her into the patrol wagon and they started a race with the stork . When the pickaninny was born the Rifle Squad examined him carefully to see if it was Earl Williams who they knew was hiding somewhere .
MCCUE: Did you get that , Hildy ?
HILDY: No what ? Hildy 's phone rings . She answers .
HILDY: If Walter Burns calls , hold the wire for me , will you ? I 'll be right back .
MCCUE: Okay , Hildy . Well , we ca n't get any official statement
MAYOR: Do n't pester me now , please . I got a lot on my mind .
MCCUE: His Honor wo n't say anything . He hangs up and exits out of scene .
MAYOR: Have you seen Sheriff Hartman ?
MCCUE: It 's hard to say , Your Honor . The place is so full of cockroaches .
MURPHY: Say , Your Honor , what effect 's this jail-break going to have on the colored voters ?
MAYOR: Not an iota . In what way can an unavoidable misfortune of this sort influence the duty of every citizen , colored or otherwise ?
ENDICOTT: Your Honor , is there a Red Menace o ai n't there ? The Sheriff comes scooting in .
MAYOR: Hartman , I 've been looking for you !
MURPHY: So have we !
ENDICOTT: What 's the dope , Sheriff ?
MURPHY: Who engineered this getaway ?
HARTMAN: Just a minute ! We 've got him located .
ENDICOTT: Williams ?
MURPHY: Where is he ?
HARTMAN: Where he used to live . You can catch the Riot Squad it 's just going out . The boys beat it , fast .
MAYOR: Pete , I want to talk to you !
HARTMAN: I ai n't got time , Fred , honest . I 'll see you after .
MAYOR: Did you actually give Williams that gun ?
HARTMAN: The professor asked me for it I thought it was for something scientific !
MAYOR: Pete , I 've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf
SCHWARTZ: Hiya , Your Honor . Schwartz calling . How about it , Your Honor ? Any statement on the Red uprising tomorrow ?
MAYOR: What Red uprising ?
HARTMAN: There 'll be no Red uprising !
SCHWARTZ: Gim me rewrite The Governor says the situation calls for the militia .
MAYOR: You can quote me as saying that anything the Governor says is a tissue of lies .
SCHWARTZ: Hello , Jake . Here 's a red-hot statement from the Governor . He claims that the Mayor and the Sheriff have shown themselves to be a couple of eight-year-olds playing with fire .
SCHWARTZ' VOICE: Quote him as follows `` It is a lucky thing for the city that next Tuesday is Election Day , as the citizens will thus be saved the expense of impeaching the Mayor and the Sheriff . '' That 's all call you back .
SCHWARTZ: Nice to have seen you , Mayor . He exits , whistling .
MAYOR: We 've got to go somewhere private , Pete . I 've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder . They start out .

MAYOR: Four hundred ! Do you want to bankrupt this administration ?
HARTMAN: I 'm getting them for twelve dollars a night .
MAYOR: Twelve dollars ! For those rheumatic uncles of yours ? Out shooting everybody they see fo the fun of it ?
HARTMAN: If you 're talking about my brother- in-law , he 's worked for the city fifteen years .

HARTMAN: Well , there 's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around
MAYOR: I know it ! But they 've got nothing to do with this case ! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we 're going to lose 'em ?

You 've taken a city that 's een graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you 're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York 's having under La Guardia ! We 'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody 'll vote fo them not even their wives !
HILDY: I 'd like to think .

BENSINGER: Nothing ah detrimental , I hope .
BURNS: I should say not ! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning .
BENSINGER: Oh , did you care for the poem , Mr. Burns ?

BURNS: It does n't have to rhyme !
BENSINGER: Gee , I 'm terribly grateful , Miste Burns . Do you suppose there might be an opening some time as foreign correspondent ? I parley a little French , you know .

LOUIE: What do you mean , I handed her ? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street .
BURNS: Now everything 's fine . She 's probably squawking her head off in some police station .
LOUIE: I do n't think she 's talking much You know what I mean ? He winks reassuringly .
HILDY: Do n't tell me was she killed ?
BURNS: Was she ? Did you notice ?

SCHWARTZ: The door was locked .
WILSON: She and Mollie were talking .
HILDY: I do n't know anything , I tell you . There 's been an accident .
HARTMAN: Johnson , there 's something very peculiar going on .
HILDY: You can send somebody with me if you do n't believe me !
HARTMAN: I was n't born yesterday . Now the oys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy
HILDY: Nobody 's trying to put anything ove on you . I 'm getting out of here and you ca n't stop me !
MURPHY: You 're not going anywhere . She 's got the story sewed up , Pete . That 's why Burns is here .
SCHWARTZ: We 're on to you , Hildy . Let us in on it .
BURNS: If you 've any accusations to make , Hartman , make them in the prope manner . Otherwise , I 'll have to ask you to get out .
HARTMAN: You 'll ask me to what ?
BURNS: Get out !
HARTMAN: Close that door . Do n't let anybody in or out .
MURPHY: Come on , Pinky ! Give 'em a little third degree .
ENDICOTT: Make them talk and you got Williams , Pinky !
HARTMAN: Johnson , I 'm going to the bottom of this . What do you know about Williams ? Are you going to talk or are n't you ?
HILDY: What do I know about Williams ?
HARTMAN: All right , boys . Take her along . I got ways of making her talk . The deputies seize Hildy . She struggles .
HILDY: Look out , you
MCCUE: What 's the use of fighting , Hildy ?
DEPUTIES: Hey , she 's got a gun ! Look out , she 's got a gun !
HILDY: No , you do n't ! Walter !
BURNS: What is it ? Here !
HARTMAN: Gim me that . He takes the gun from the deputy .
HARTMAN: Where 'd you get this ?
HILDY: I 've got a right to carry a gun if I want to .
HARTMAN: Not this gun ! Burns comes into scene .
BURNS: I can explain that , Hartman . When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself .
HARTMAN: Oh , you did ! Well , that 's very , very interesting . This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with !
BURNS: Are you trying to make me out a liar ?
MURPHY: It 's the last time I ever trust a woman , Hildy .
SCHWARTZ: Maybe Williams was gon na be her best man .
WILSON: That 's pretty rotten , Hildy . Crossing your own pals .
HARTMAN: Where is Earl Williams ? Where you got him ?
BURNS: You 're barking up the wrong tree , Hartman .
HARTMAN: I 'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is .
HILDY: He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer .
HARTMAN: What ?
HILDY: With a bag of marshmallows .
HARTMAN: Speak up ! What do you know about this .
BURNS: My dear Hartman !
MURPHY: Can that ! Where is he ?
BURNS: The Morning Post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals . You ought to know that .
HARTMAN: No ? Well Johnson , you 're under arrest . You , too , Burns .
BURNS: Who 's under arrest ? You pimple-headed , square-toed spy do you realize what you 're doing ?
HARTMAN: I 'll show you what I 'm doing . Burns , you 're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post . I 'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this .
BURNS: You 'll see nothing of the kind , Sheriff .
HARTMAN: We 'll just start by impounding the Post property . Is that your desk ?
HILDY: No !
BURNS: Yes ! What are you afraid of Hildy ? I dare him to move that desk out of here .
HARTMAN: Oh , you do , eh ? All right , boys . Confiscate that desk .
BURNS: Hartman , if you take this desk out of this building , I 'll put you behind ars .
HARTMAN: You will , eh ? Well , we 'll see about that . All right , boys . Take it .
BURNS: I 'm warning you it 'll be a Federal offense . And you 'll be an accessory !
HARTMAN: We 'll take a chance on that , Burns . Go ahead , boys .
MRS. BALDWIN: You wait outside , Bruce .
BRUCE: But , mother
MRS. BALDWIN: No ! You 'll weaken when you see that little Jezebel ! I 'm going to tell her what I think of her !
HILDY: Mother !
MRS. BALDWIN: That man there !
HILDY: Mother ! Oh , I 'm so glad to see you ! Are you all right ? Tell me . Mrs. Baldwin indignantly shakes her off .
HARTMAN: What 's the idea here ?
POLICEMAN: This lady claims she was kidnapped .
HARTMAN: What ?
MRS. BALDWIN: They dragged me all the way down the stairs
HARTMAN: Just a minute . Did did this man have anything to do with it ?
MRS. BALDWIN: He was the one in charge of everything ! He told them to kidnap me !
BURNS: Are you referring to me , Madam ?
MRS. BALDWIN: You know you did !
HARTMAN: What about this , Burns ? Kidnapping , eh ?
BURNS: Oh , trying to frame me , eh ! I neve saw this woman before in my life !
MRS. BALDWIN: Oh , what a thing to say ! I was standing right here - after the girl jumped out of the window .
HARTMAN: Did you get the Mayor ?
DEPUTY: He 's coming over .
BURNS: Now , Madam be honest . If you were out joy-riding , drunk , and got into some scrape , why do n't you admit it , instead of accusing innocent people ?
MRS. BALDWIN: You ruffian ! How dare you say a thing like that ?
HILDA: Please , Mother , he 's just crazy !
MRS. BALDWIN: I 'll tell you something more . I 'll tell you why they did it !
BURNS: Come on , Sheriff . We 've got to get ail .
MRS. BALDWIN: I was in here and they had some kind of murderer in with them . They were hiding him ! This is a bombshell . The room is electrified .
HARTMAN: Hiding him ? In here ?
MURPHY: Hiding him where ?
HILDY: Mother !
REPORTERS: Where was he ? Where 'd they have him ? Etc .
BURNS: Madam , you 're a cockeyed liar ! And you know it !
BURNS: Come on , Sheriff , we 've got to get ail . Three answering knocks come from the desk .
HARTMAN: What was that ?
DEPUTY: Look out , Sheriff . He may shoot !
HARTMAN: Get your guns out !
HILDY: He 's harmless .
HARTMAN: Do n't take any chances . Shoot through the desk .
HILDY: He ca n't hurt anybody . You 've got his gun .
MRS. BALDWIN: Oh , dear ! Oh , dear !
BURNS: You grey-haired old Judas !
MRS. BALDWIN: Let me out ! Let me out of here !
HARTMAN: You stand there !
MURPHY'S VOICE: City Desk ! Quick !
SCHWARTZ' VOICE: Gim me the Desk !
HARTMAN: You there !
ENDICOTT'S VOICE: City Desk ! Hurry !
MCCUE'S VOICE: Gim me Emil
HARTMAN: You cover the window .
MURPHY'S VOICE: Look out where you 're pointing that gun !
WILSON'S VOICE: Lem me have the Desk ! Quick !
MURPHY'S VOICE: Hold the wire ! I 've got a flash fo you !
BURNS: Call Duffy !
HARTMAN: No , you do n't !
BURNS: Do you want to get us scooped ?
MCCUE'S VOICE: Emil ? Hang on for a second .
HARTMAN: Now then , everybody aim at the center . And when I say three
HILDY: That 's murder !
HARTMAN: All right ! Carl ! Frank ! One of you get on each side of the desk . Take hold of the cover . They do .
SCHWARTZ: Hold it ! Something coming up .

WILSON: Right away now !
HARTMAN: Everybody ready ? All right . Now then , up with it .

MURPHY'S VOICE: Earl Williams was just captured in the Press Room of the Criminal Courts Building , hiding in a desk .
MCCUE: Williams in a rolltop
WILSON: nabbed Williams hiding
ENDICOTT'S VOICE: found Williams ' hiding place .

MURPHY: An old sweetheart of Williams ' doublecrossed him . Call you back . He hangs up .
REPORTERS: Where 's that old lady ? Hey , Madam ! Where 'd she go ? Where 's the old dame ? Etc. , etc . They run out after Mrs. Baldwin , the Mayor entering just after they go . Burns and Hildy , handcuffed together , stand near the Sheriff .
HARTMAN: Hello , girlie gim me Cooley . Quick !
BURNS: Hartwell , you 're going to wish you 'd never been born ! The Mayor comes into scene .
MAYOR: Fine work , Pete ! You certainly delivered the goods . I 'm proud of you .
HARTMAN: Look kind o ' natural , do n't they , Fred ?
MAYOR: A sight for sore eyes !
HARTMAN: Aiding an escaped criminal ! And a little charge of kidnapping I 'm looking into . But that 's the jail ! There must be somebody there !
MAYOR: Well ! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds !
BURNS: Does it ? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post .
MAYOR: Your luck 's not with you now !
HARTMAN: Cooley ? I caught Williams single- handed we 're going to proceed with the hanging per schedule ! He wiggles the hook for another call .
BURNS: You 're going to be in office fo exactly two days more and then we 're pulling your nose out of the feed ag .
HARTMAN: Give me the District Attorney 's office . I 'll tell you what you 'll be doing making brooms in the State penitentiary . Hello , D'Arrasty ! This is Hartwell . Come over to my office , will you ? I 've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions .
BURNS: Duffy ! Get Liebowitz !
MAYOR: All the lawyers in the world are n't going to help you !
BURNS: This is the Morning Post you 're talking to !
MAYOR: The power of the press , huh !
BURNS: Bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is President ! Yes and Kings !
PINKUS: Here 's your reprieve . The Mayor and Sheriff spin around .
MAYOR: Get out of here !
PINKUS: You ca n't bribe me !
BURNS: What 's this ?
HARTMAN: Get out of here , you !
PINKUS: I wo n't . Here 's your reprieve .
HILDY: What ?
PINKUS: I do n't want to be City Sealer . I do n't like seals anyhow . They smell .
MAYOR: Who is this man ?
HARTMAN: Throw him out , Frank .
HILDY: Who was bribing you ?
PINKUS: They would n't take it .
MAYOR: You 're insane !
BURNS: What did I tell you ? An unseen power ! What 's your name ?
PINKUS: Silas F. Pinkus .
MAYOR: You drunken idiot ! Arrest him ! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- ull story like that !
HARTMAN: It 's a frame-up ! Some imposter !
HILDY: Wait a minute ! Let go there !
BURNS: Murder , uh ?
HILDY: Hanging an innocent man to win an election !
HARTMAN: That 's a lie ! !
MAYOR: I never saw him before !
BURNS: When did you deliver this first ?
HILDY: Who did you talk to ?
PINKUS: They started right in bribing me !
HILDY: Who 's 'they ' ?
PINKUS: Them !
MAYOR: That 's absurd on the face of it , Mr. Burns ! He 's talking like a child .
BURNS: Out of the mouths of babes .
MAYOR: He 's insane or drunk or something . Why , if this unfortunate man , Williams , has really been reprieved , I personally am tickled to death . Are n't you , Pete ?
HILDY: Go on , you 'd kill your mother to get elected !
MAYOR: That 's a horrible thing to say , Miss Johnson , about anybody ! Now , look here , Walter , you 're an intelligent man
BURNS: Just a minute . All right , Mr. Pinkus . Let 's have your story .
PINKUS: Well , I been married for ten years and
BURNS: Skip all that .
MAYOR: Take those handcuffs off our friends , Pete . That was n't at all necessary .
HARTMAN: I was just going to ! He gets the key from the officer .
MAYOR: Walter , I ca n't tell you how badly I feel about this . There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle .
HARTMAN: I was only doing my duty . Nothing personal in it . They are set free .
HILDY: You guys better quit politics and take in washing .
MAYOR: Sheriff , this document is authentic ! Earl Williams has been reprieved , this Commonwealth has been spared the painful necessity of shedding lood .
BURNS: Save that for the Tribune .
MAYOR: What did you say your name was Pinkus ?
PINKUS: That 's right . He shows the Mayor a locket .
MAYOR: A very fine-looking women .
PINKUS: She 's good enough for me ! And if I was to go home and tell my wife
MAYOR: I understand perfectly , Mr. Pinkus , and as long as I am Mayor
BURNS: Which ought to be about three hours more , I 'd say .
HILDY: Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment .
BURNS: And your arrest . You 'll each get about ten years , I think .
MAYOR: Do n't make any hasty decisions , Mr. Burns , you might run into a thumping ig libel suit .
HILDY: You 're going to run into the Governor .
MAYOR: Now , my old friend the Governor and I understand each other perfectly .
HARTMAN: And so do I !
MAYOR: So do you what , you hoodoo ! And now , Mr. Pinkus , if you 'll come with us , we 'll take you over to the Warden 's office and deliver this eprieve .
BURNS: Wait till those two future jailbirds ead the Morning Post tomorrow .
HILDY: How was that for a tight squeeze ?
BURNS: Do n't tell me you were worried !
HILDY: Worried ! I was petrified . Were n't you ?
BURNS: Uh-uh . As long as we were in there together pitching they could n't lick us . Well , it 's been a lot of fun .
HILDY: In a way .
BURNS: I mean working together . Just like the old days . The things we 've een through , Hildy .
HILDY: We 've certainly been in some swell jams .
BURNS: Remember the time we broke into the D.A . 's office , and copied Fifi Randell 's diary ?
HILDY: Yeah . What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory ? Six scoop interviews !
BURNS: Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty 's stomach off the Coroner 's physician . We proved she was poisoned though , did n't we ?
HILDY: We sure did , but we had to go in hiding for a week .
BURNS: In the Shoreland Hotel . And our only chaperon was the poor old lady 's stomach .
HILDY: Do n't remind me . That 's how we happened to She breaks off . There is a moment 's pause .
BURNS: Sorry , Hildy . I did n't mean to be making love to another man 's fiancee .
HILDY: That 's all right , Walter . It 's as much my fault as yours .
BURNS: Bruce is making the nine o'clock train . I told him you 'd be on it unless you want to write this story yourself .
HILDY: Well , if it 's my last story , I 'd like it to be a good one . But I guess I ca n't , Walter .
BURNS: Suit yourself , kid . This is n't fo me to decide . Of course , you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning .
HILDY: Yeah . I suppose I could . But , Walter
BURNS: He 's going to have you the rest of his life , Hildy . Ca n't you give me another hour ?
HILDY: I do n't know what to do , Walter .
BURNS: Flip a coin .
HILDY: All right . Heads I go tails I stay to write the story . Ready ?
BURNS: Ready .
HILDY: What 's the difference ? I 'm going to write that story and you know it !
BURNS: Hildy !
HILDY: Do n't touch me ! I 'm not doing it fo you !
BURNS: Then why are you doing it ?
HILDY: Because I 'm a newspaper woman , Heaven help me !
BURNS: The greatest yarn ever written by anybody . My hat 's off to you , Hildy !
HILDY: Thanks .
BURNS: And what a way to quit . While you 're still champion ! That 's the way to leave , Hildy !
HILDY: Yeah . Only only I 'm not leaving , Walter .
BURNS: What do you mean ? Bruce 'll be waiting for you in Albany .
HILDY: No , he wo n't . I wired him that I was n't coming .
BURNS: Where 'd you wire him ?
HILDY: On the nine o'clock train . That 's the one he took , is n't it ?
BURNS: Sure .
HILDY: It 's awfully clear now . Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home and affection and peace . I could n't do that for him , Walter . I 'm what you made me a cheap reporter who 'd give up her soul for a story ! Is that job still open ?
BURNS: Both jobs are open , Hildy . The paper and being Mrs. Walter Burns .
HILDY: Thanks , Walter , but it 's no good . We tried it .
BURNS: Sure , it was good it was wonderful ! Only you expected it to be like othe marriages . It ca n't be like othe marriages we 're different ! We 're a different world . Look at what we went through today . I would n't trade that for any honeymoon in the world . I bet you would n't , either .
HILDY: A fine honeymoon , with a murdere ight in the boudoir ! And that othe honeymoon in a coal mine !
BURNS: That 's what makes it romantic . Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is , and vice versa . But us you never know where I am and I 'm not sure where you are . That 's Romance !
HILDY: Well , maybe I 'd like to know just once !
BURNS: Hildy , if that 's what you want , all ight . We 'll even go to how about Niagara Falls ?
HILDY: Niagara Falls ! Walter , you do n't mean that ?

HILDY: What would you do if it was a daughter ?
BURNS: Well , if she looked like you Say ! My brains and your looks that might n't be such a bad combination .
HILDY: What 's the matter with my brains ?
BURNS: What 's the good of arguing about something that probably does n't exist ? Look , Hildy , I 'm proposing to you . What do you say ?
HILDY: Well , I 'd like to be lady-like and think it over .
BURNS: I do n't want to rush you . Take a couple of seconds .
JUDGE: This is an outrage , Mr. Burns ! Sending a gunman to kidnap me !
BURNS: Now , wait a minute , Judge . This is n't a kidnapping . You 've got the legal power to perform a marriage ceremony , have n't you ?
HILDY: What !
BURNS: Now do n't argue , Hildy . How about it , Judge ?
JUDGE: Yes , but
BURNS: Then go ahead . Come on , Hildy .
HILDY: Nobody 's going to rush me into anything ! You keep away from me !
LOUIE: All right , Judge .
1ST REPORTER: I 'll be doggoned ! A shotgun marriage !
2ND REPORTER: Do n't they usually keep the gun on the man ?
JUDGE: `` so long as you both do live ? ''
BURNS: I will .
HILDY: That 's what he said the last time . Do n't believe him , Judge .
BURNS: Hildy , from this time on no tricks , no double-crossing everything on the level !
HILDY: You 're not fooling anybody .
JUDGE: `` Hildegarde Johnson , will you have this man as your wedded husband , to live together in the ordinances and estate of Matrimony ? ''
HILDY: What would you do with a gun in you ack ?
LOUIE: Quiet !
JUDGE: `` Will you love him , comfort him , honor and keep him in sickness or in health ;
HILDY: If I know where he is .

HILDY: I will if he will .

BURNS: How about Bruce 's ?
HILDY: Walter , you ca n't do that !
BURNS: Sure , I can . Look at the policy I gave him ! `` With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow And thereto I plight thee my troth . ''
REPORTER: Say , I 'm surprised she got the ring ack !
JUDGE: `` pronounce you Man and Wife . ''
BURNS: Hildy , darling !
HILDY: Yes 'Hildy , darling ' . I 'm just a fool . That 's what I am . I know what it 's going to be like .
BURNS: It 'll be Heaven !
HILDY: Sure , Heaven ! You 've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in to get a new story for you paper !
HILDY: Walter !
WALTER: But , Hildy , listen
BURNS: But , Hildy I can explain
HILDY: You you ! !

ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Good evening .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
LEW WASSERMAN: This thing is going to be gigantic . I wish I had twenty percent of the take .
REPORTER ONE: Does tonight 's incredible reaction surprise you , Mr. Hitchcock ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No , when I was planning North by Northwest I could already hear the screams and laughter . ( then , to a BEAUTIFUL
BLONDE FAN: Any questions , my dear ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
REPORTER TWO: Mr. Hitchcock , you 've directed forty-six motion pictures . You host a hit TV show seen around the world . You 're the most famous director in the history of the medium but you 're sixty years old . Should n't you just quit while you 're ahead ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms gouged out with arrows .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Talking of arrows , did you read Mr. Weiler 's review in the New York Times ? Apparently , he found `` the climax '' to be and I quote `` overdrawn . ''
ALMA: I doubt whether Mr. Weiler has had a climax in years .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And how about this little grenade ?
READING: North by Northwest reminds us of Hitchcock 's earlier , more youthfully inventive spy thrillers . ''
BEAT: And just to drive the nail into the coffin , there 's a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense .
ALMA: Do n't be maudlin , you know how much it aggravates me .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Tell me , dear . Am I really too old ?
ALMA: Yes . A true relic . And lest we forget , a notably corpulent one .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You always know precisely where to plunge the dagger , do n't you ?
ALMA: Right between the shoulder blades . I learned it from your pictures .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Where are you off to ?
ALMA: I 'm seeing Whit for brunch after I drop you off at the studio . Why do n't you join us ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We 've just established that I 'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight .
ALMA: You 'll feel better as soon as you find a project . Has n't Peggy unearthed any decent books yet ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Sleeping pills with dust jackets .
ALMA: Well ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Very presentable .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Hurry up , darling . You 're pruning .
FIRST GUARD: Mr. Hitchcock . Mrs. Hitchcock .
ALMA: There 's a story out there waiting for you somewhere , Hitch . I promise .
PEGGY: Fox is offering you The Diary of Anne Frank for the third time . Hitch directs his response to Silvio .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The audience would spend the entire picture waiting for Miss Frank to discover the corpse I 'd hidden in the attic . Would n't you agree , Silvio ?
SILVIO: Si .
PEGGY: MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book , Casino Royale , with Cary Grant . Definitely your style .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Does n't she know I just made that movie ? It 's called North by Northwest . And `` style '' is merely self-plagiarism . Silvio nods , then recommences the shave .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
PEGGY: I 'll see what I can find .
WHITFIELD COOK: Thank God I had a pocketful of pretzels . I was hiding in that props cupboard all night .
THEN: That 'll teach me to use a bedroom set instead of the real thing .
ALMA: Serves you right .
WHITFIELD COOK: I ca n't believe he let me have you all to myself for a whole afternoon . Especially looking this beautiful . He clinks her glass .
ALMA: All this relentless sycophancy is giving me indigestion .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
A SMILE: What are you after ?
WHITFIELD COOK: Elizabeth ? Over the moon since I promised her the dedication in my new novel . So what are you working on these days ?
ALMA: Hitch is going out of his mind looking for his next project . You know how unbearable he is when he does n't have something lined up .
WHITFIELD COOK: Almost as unbearable as when he does .
ALMA: Almost .
WHITFIELD COOK: I meant you . What are you working on ?
ALMA: I 'm satisfied spending time in my garden .
WHITFIELD COOK: That is one lucky garden .
ALMA: Ah . All is finally revealed .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
WHITFIELD COOK: The most fun I ever had was working with you .
ALMA: I suppose I could give it a look .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Anything . Anything at all ?
PEGGY: Nothing suitable . Is that water or do I need to call Alma ? He drains it playfully .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Gin . Mother 's ruin .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
PEGGY: It sounds ghastly . Everyone in town 's already passed .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And who is everyone ?
PEGGY: The story department finished the coverage this morning .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Is this the one based on Ed Gein , the serial killer ? He takes the coverage and reads for himself .
PEGGY: You 're kidding .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Peggy . This is the boy who dug up his own mother .
ALMA: Hungry ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Famished . She disappears to take off her coat .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook ?
ALMA: This might be the one , Alfred . He finally looks up .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Leave it on the night stand .
ALMA: There are calories in that , you know .
ED GEIN: Are n't you cold , ma ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Oh God .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Read the bit in the motel bathroom .
ALMA: Now ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: But what if someone really good made a horror movie ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Just think of the shock value . Killing off your leading lady halfway through .
ALMA: Actually , I think it 's a huge mistake . Hitch falls silent , a chastised schoolboy .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Peggy , I want you to summon you minions
PEGGY: Minions . Certainly . And who might they e ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Get them started buying copies of `` Psycho . '' Peggy stands in the doorway , watching
PEGGY: How many do you need ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: All of them . I want every copy , nationwide .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
PEGGY: All that celery 's affecting your brain .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: That 's exactly the point , my dear .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
HITCHCOCK: That is my intention , madam . Yes . Hitch taps the photo of ED GEIN .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I only wish he looked more like William Holden and less like Elmer Fudd . The other columnists scribble down the quote .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
PEGGY: How she deals with a demanding boss when she 's trying to relax on he weekends off ?
LEW WASSERMAN: ( re the faces of the
GOSSIP COLUMNISTS: I told you , Hitch . This thing 's strictly for the drive-in crowd .
WHITFIELD COOK: Now , if this were a Hitchcock picture what would two characters like us , married to other people , be saying ?
ALMA: You do n't have to pretend you 're not upset he has n't read it yet , you know .
WHITFIELD COOK: I 'm a big boy . I can take it .
ALMA: Well , I loved it . What terrific fun it must have been to research .
WHITFIELD COOK: Certainly more fun than reading those eviews .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
THEN: Do you think he really will read it ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I wonder how that could have happened .
LEW WASSERMAN: I 've seen happier faces on a school bus going over a cliff .
PEGGY: I told you it would be too much .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: But they ca n't stop looking , can they ?
BARNEY BALABAN: The truth is , Hitch , every time you want to do something `` different '' like The Wrong Man or Vertigo , someone loses money .
LEW WASSERMAN: So we should stop trying to give them something new ?
BARNEY BALABAN: You owe Paramount one last picture , Hitch . Ca n't you do something like North y Northwest but for us this time instead of for MGM ? Hitch 's stare remains inscrutable .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: `` Psycho . ''
BARNEY BALABAN: No one respects the name Hitchcock more than Paramount . But even a talented man sometimes backs the wrong horse .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Are you telling me `` no ? '' Balaban maintains a calm , pleasant front .
BARNEY BALABAN: I think you know me better than that , Hitch . I would never say `` no '' to you .
LEW WASSERMAN: What a putz . You know what his family did efore they built those movie palaces ? Ran a grocery store .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: My father ran a grocery store .
LEW WASSERMAN: Exactly . That 's what I 'm saying . He should show some respect . Hitch turns to Lew .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: They think I 've lost my touch , Lew . My association with television has cheapened me .
LEW WASSERMAN: Are you referring to that deal I got you where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine grand an episode and you own the negative ? That 's my kind of cheap .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: They just want the same thing over and over . They 've put me in a coffin and now they 're nailing down the lid . Lew puts a comforting hand on him
LEW WASSERMAN: Hitch , I will never let that happen .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Eight hundred thousand Give or take . Lew digests the figure
LEW WASSERMAN: I have whisky in the car .
ALMA: You 're back early .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What about him ?
ALMA: He knows you well enough .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Enjoy the pool now . We might not have it for that much longer . He looks off cryptically .
ALMA: Why ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Paramount refuses to finance the movie . Imagine The studio that brought you Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On Earth considers Psycho distasteful . He brushes some fallen leaves off his chair .
ALMA: Why not wait ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We 're going to have to go it alone , old girl .
BEAT: We 'll finance the movie ourselves .
ALMA: Are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time ? We took risks , we experimented . We invented new ways of making pictures ecause we had to . A long moment as he gazes across the pool .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
LEW WASSERMAN: We finance it . Independently . Paramount only distributes itin exchange for 40 percent of the profits .
BARNEY BALABAN: Interesting . But tell us , what exactly is Paramount distributing ? Is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother 's dress ?
LEW WASSERMAN: What this picture is about is the eputation of Alfred Hitchcock .
BARNEY BALABAN: No-one 's arguing that .
LEW WASSERMAN: Barney , it 's very simple . This is Mr. Hitchcock 's next film . Are you in or are you out ? A long silence .
BARNEY BALABAN: Well , obviously you have a lot of passion for this project . Let me talk it ove with a few people internally and I 'll get ack to you .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
LEW WASSERMAN: No . Now .
BARNEY BALABAN: Fine . We 'll take that deal . If you can get the money Finally , Hitchcock speaks up
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We 've already got it , Barney .
ALMA: The movie will be splendid .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Are you sure ?
ALMA: Of the movie ? Not in the least . But of you ? Unquestionably .
JOSEPH STEFANO: Joe Stefano . Good to meet you .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
PEGGY: I thought only director 's assistants needed psychiatrists , not writers .
JOSEPH STEFANO: Do you see a shrink , Mr. Hitchcock ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No .
JOSEPH STEFANO: The usual sex . Rage . My mother .
ACCOUNTANT: There 's still the federal income tax payments the property taxes Not to mention the absence of any salary while he 's actually making the film
ALMA: Stop waffling , Donald . Give it to me straight .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ACCOUNTANT: Hitch was n't exaggerating . If the film 's a flop , you 're going to have to sell the house . Alma digests this .
ALMA: Where do you suggest we cut ?
ACCOUNTANT: Anywhere you can .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I got Joe Stefano to write out the first few scenes . Why do n't you take a look ?
ALMA: We 're about to have dinner . You do n't need anything else .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Well ? She does n't look up
ALMA: Hire him .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is one to the censor .
ALMA: Whatever you do , Alfred , do n't lose you temper .
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: The Code will absolutely not permit you to show a knife penetrating a woman 's flesh .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I assure you , Geoffrey , my murders , are always models of taste and discretion .
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: Is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: She wo n't be nude . She 'll be wearing a shower cap .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: We might accept a shot from outside the athroom window with Marion in silhouette above the shoulders provided the glass is frosted .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It 's completely necessary . Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister . It 's a clue to the girl 's disappearance .
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: No American movie has ever found it `` necessary '' to show a toilet , let alone to flush it .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead ?
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: Mr. Hitchcock , if this office denies you a seal , and we 're certainly heading in that direction , your movie will not be eleased in a single theater in this country . Will you be making jokes then ? Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Everyone in Hollywood resents me . I make them millions and yet every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners , waiting for them to say , just once , `` You 're good . '' He looks around the luxurious office .
ANALYST'S VOICE: That must hurt .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Deeply .
ANALYST'S VOICE: Take your time . Now Hitch claws at his tie . It 's hot in here .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It 's just that , more and more lately , I 've been having these impulses .
ANALYST'S VOICE: What kind of impulses ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Strong ones .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Send them all back to Glendale .
PEGGY: The Lazar Office tells me he 's crazy to work with you .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Well , tell `` Swifty '' he should n't have overexposed his client on television .
ALMA: Unlike certain people we could mention .
PEGGY: Why , Alma , you 're not suggesting that Mr. Perkins is ?
ANTHONY PERKINS: I ca n't count how many times I 've seen Strangers On a Train and Rope .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Well , Norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies . Appealing , sensitive , suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not .
ANTHONY PERKINS: My only worry is that playing Norman might cut too close to home .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: How so ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ANTHONY PERKINS: I was incredibly close to my mother . So close I remember wishing my father would drop dead . And then when I was five , he did just thatHe keeled over from a heart attack .
LAUGHING NERVOUSLY: You see I 've been guilty my whole life , Mr. Hitchcock . Hitch is enthralled .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Try to remember this is all just make elieve . Perkins wishes he could be more reassured
ANTHONY PERKINS: Not to be prudish , but how far do you plan to push Norman 's relationship with his mother ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Further than you can possibly imagine .
ALMA: Stop grumbling . A bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: If I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl , they 'd let me get away with anything .
ALMA: Well you ca n't . She 's a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And all the more desirable .
ALMA: Lew suggested Deborah Kerr .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Too Scottish .
ALMA: What about Janet Leigh ? She 's always the ` good girl ' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil . Lew mentioned her name . Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans ' parties ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson 's appeal to the Duke of Windso was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar .
JANET LEIGH: You know , I 've been so immersed in preparing to play Marion I 'd almost forgotten how to laugh . Hitch summons the waiter with a snap .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Now , you must try the banana shortcake .
JANET LEIGH: Nothing for me , thank you . I 'm watching my figure . Alma watches all this with a fixed smile .
ALMA: You 're not the only one . We 're fine , thank you .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Bring her the banana shortcake , George . In fact make it two large portions . He pointedly shifts to face Janet .
JANET LEIGH: I 've written a complete history fo herIt seems silly , but it helps me .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It does n't sound silly at all . Tell me one of her deepest secrets .
JANET LEIGH: She leads a double life . For instance , when she works at the Lowery office , she wears Tweed perfume . But , when she and Sam are together , she recklessly breaks out her one expensive bottle `` My Sin '' y Lanvin . She notices Alma 's expression .
ALMA: You and the Shurlock Office .
JANET LEIGH: It 's just I mean even if you shoot me from here well it 's not as if my figure is oyish .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Allow me to put your mind at rest .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: If you 'll excuse me .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Do n't upset yourself , darling . It 's only a bloody movie .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver ? No . Absolutely not . We 'll find other places to cut .
ALMA: There are n't any other places . And furthermore , they 'll be no more shipments from Maxim 's either . We ca n't afford it . She snatches the list out of his hand .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: But those geese are from Barstow not Marseilles .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: We all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good , do n't we , Alfred ?
ED GEIN: Stay here . I 'm going to get the knives .
DEAD WOMAN: Help me .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Ed ! Ed !
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Oh , shut up . Just get the first take under your belt you 'll be fine . But Hitch is n't looking convinced .
PEGGY: I still ca n't believe you cast Vera Miles as the sister .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I 've still got her under contract . I may as well get something out of it .
PEGGY: Rather a thankless role , do n't you think ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: For an utterly thankless girl .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
PEGGY: Shurlock 's office called again . They want to know when you 'll be making the changes to the script . Hitch gets up from his chair .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The more we frustrate them the more thei interest will wane .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
VERA MILES: Break it to me gently . Am I playing a lesbian librarian ?
RITA RIGGS: He chose it himself and had it imported from Paris . Vera laughs dryly at a WIG on a dummy head .
VERA MILES: If I wear that , I 'm going to look like George Washington .
RITA RIGGS: Wait until you see the undergarments he picked out for you . Vera tosses off her shirt .
VERA MILES: I just have to keep telling myself , one more picture and I 'm free as a bird .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Are you decent my dear ?
JANET LEIGH: Am I alright ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Perfect .
ANTHONY PERKINS: I want to thank you again for this opportunity , Mr. Hitchcock .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It 's just `` Hitch '' , Tony . Hold the cock .
JANET LEIGH: And we 're about to move to a whole new neighborhood .
VERA MILES: Morning Janet . Morning Tony .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: That 's hand-woven imported camel hai from Rodier . Do n't you approve ?
VERA MILES: You 're the genius . She checkmates him with a ravishing smile .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Everyone 's is . Until Alma finishes the evisions . Now hurry along , Vera . You 're just in time for the oath .
VERA MILES: The what ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I solemnly promise
CREW: I solemnly promise
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho
CREW: That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: To friends , relatives , trade reporters o columnists not even to outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower , God bless him .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ANTHONY PERKINS: Now , Hitch , explain to me why I 'm watching Marion undress ?
JANET LEIGH: I feel like I should take offense at that .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I do n't knowPerhaps as a boy , Norman secretly watched his mother preparing fo her nightly bath .
JANET LEIGH: Maybe there was a transom over the athroom door ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Yes one he could access with a chai so long as he was stealthy .
JANET LEIGH: Well , a boy 's first glimpse of a naked woman is usually his mother .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ANTHONY PERKINS: SoI 'm reliving the past , repeating a itual with Marion ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You 're the actor . You figure it out . Tony flinches at Hitch 's brusque response .
JANET LEIGH: Hitch , I have a question . Why is the hole much larger on this side ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: All the better to see you at the greatest possible angle my dear
JANET LEIGH: Wow . You really do your research , do n't you ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It 's just my Jesuit work ethic .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: My mother ? Yes .
THEN: The Oscar is your mother .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You 're a fine one to talk .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You will be wearing a white bra like this for the opening scene on the bed . And then after you 've stolen the money
JANET LEIGH: I switch to one of these .
RITA RIGGS: Are you sure you do n't want to look at something a little more elegant ?
HITCHCOCK: No . They have to look like they were ought at Sears and Roebuck . I want every woman in the audience to look up at Janet having sex with John Gavin and think , ` that could be me ' . Janet reads the label . It 's `` Maidenform . ''
JANET: This is the brand I wear .
HITCHCOCK: We 're ready for a fitting .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself
PEGGY: Good luck getting this one past the censor .
WHITFIELD COOK: You girls go on ahead .
PEGGY: If you ask me , the credits should read `` Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Alma Reville . ''
ALMA: The people who matter know . That 's all that counts .
PEGGY: I 'd hate to see Shurlock 's face when he eads this . She puts the pages down .
WHITFIELD COOK: Hello , stranger .
ALMA: Whit .
WHITFIELD COOK: Where have you been hiding yourself ?
ALMA: I 've been doing the revisions on She points to the PSYCHO HOUSE on the ridge .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
WHITFIELD COOK: Psycho .
THEN: And how is the old boy ?
ALMA: In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he 's back on the set .
WHITFIELD COOK: And you ? How are you ?
ALMA: Not bad . I 've got eight hundred words to do for Reader 's Digest on what it 's like to be married to a man obsessed by murder . He looks at her a moment .
WHITFIELD COOK: I 've got a better idea . He steps closer .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I 'll be right there .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Was there a line at the market ?
ALMA: No . Actually , I 'm back sooner than I expected .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Would you like a cocktail ? He heads for the liquor cabinet .
ALMA: No . And you should n't either .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I do n't care .
THEN: I was filming all day with John Gavin a good-looking chap but , really , plywood is more expressive . His love scene with Janet may be most horrifying thing in the picture .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: You should tell Whit that . He 'd be flattered .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Maybe I was too dismissive about you friend Whitfield 's book . Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it .
ALMA: I 'll see how my day shapes up .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You think they ca n't tell but they can . They know . It 's all closing in on you . The noose is tightening As he continues , we pull back and see
VERA MILES: Have you talked to him much about you personal life ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
JANET LEIGH: Not really
VERA MILES: I 'd keep it that way if I were you . He starts by choosing your hairstyle and clothes and then he wants to choose you friends and decide how many children you should have .
JANET LEIGH: Compared to Orson Welles , he 's a sweetheart .
VERA MILES: See ? He 's always watching . They laugh nervously .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What 's the hold up ?
PEGGY: It 's still engaged .
VERA MILES: Hitch , I 'm stuck on Lila 's first scene . I do n't know how strongly I should confront Sam and the detective and I
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Fake it .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It 's different when their pay is coming out of your own pocket .
ALMA: What would I do without you ?
WHITFIELD COOK: Till then , bye .
ALMA: What did you forget now ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
PR FLACK: Mr. Hitchcock , every press outlet is driving us crazy for photos
PEGGY: Are you okay ? You 've gone very pale . Peggy 's face suddenly comes into focus .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get me something long , cool and wet .
PEGGY: It 's not even three .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Give me the key !
BARNEY BALABAN: Hello , Hitch . How 's the picture ? I 'm hearing interesting things
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It 's a wonder you can hear anything ove the noise coming from the Shurlock office .
BARNEY BALABAN: I should n't be in a position of just hearing things , Hitch . It 's time you showed me some footage .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Why ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
BARNEY BALABAN: To see if you 're making a picture Paramount can actually release .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: As you well know , Barney , my contract guarantees me final cut .
BARNEY BALABAN: Your contract also says Paramount is n't equired to distribute any film that could cause us embarrassment .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis pictures you 're all so proud of . He slams the door in Balaban 's startled face .
ON PHONE: Yes , it 's Alfred Hitchcock in Hollywood , California , Jean-Claude . I need three pounds of foie gras sent on the next flight out .
THEN: That 's correct . Three . He pours himself five fingers of scotch .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
WHITFIELD COOK: Those steaks have n't changed at all , have they ?
ALMA: It 's so nice not to have to take care of someone , even if it 's just for an hour o two .
WHITFIELD COOK: I have a little surprise .
ALMA: A surprise . How fun .
JANET LEIGH: What happened to your driver ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I 've been asking myself the same thing . She smiles .
JANET LEIGH: I can give you a ride if you want .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the design for this car on Ferdinand Porsche 's cocktail napkin in a Berlin eer garden ?
JANET LEIGH: I did n't .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It 's only now that I truly appreciate just how diabolical Herr Hitler was .
JANET LEIGH: Help yourself . I pinched them from Tony 's dressing room . He takes one and chews it curiously .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: So this is what they eat at the drive- ins
JANET LEIGH: I thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Needs must when the devil drives , my dear .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: I do n't mind that he uses his obsession to fuel his art . I just do n't like it when he uses it against me .
WHITFIELD COOK: He 's like any great artist . Impossible to live with but worth the effort . ( he throws a rock into the
SEA: Van Gogh was n't exactly a walk in the park either .
ALMA: Did you know when we started out I was his boss ? He did n't even dare ask me out until he 'd worked his way up to assistant director .
WHITFIELD COOK: What do you think of that place ove there ? He nods to a SMALL BEACH HOUSE up the way .
ALMA: Looks nice . Terrific location . Why ?
WHITFIELD COOK: It 's mine . She looks at him askance . Is he joking ?
ALMA: I just saw Elizabeth . Why on earth did n't she tell me ?
WHITFIELD COOK: She does n't know about it .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
JANET LEIGH: So what did happen between you and Vera ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I was going to make her star . But she chose the life of a housewife .
WHITFIELD COOK: I 'm just leasing it for the offseason . A place to get away from the wife and kid and write .
ALMA: Very Bohemian .
WHITFIELD COOK: You might find that room interesting .
ALMA: Whit . I hope you have n't got the wrong idea .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
WHITFIELD COOK: If you were serious about helping me adapt my book , I thought it would be the perfect hideaway .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: So I read your finished treatment . `` Taxi to `` Where was it ?
ALMA: Dubrovnik .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: That 's it . Dubrovnik . Care to hear my opinion ?
ALMA: Yes . Naturally .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: There 's no other way of saying it . It 's stillborn . Dead in the water . Alma blinks , unable to hide her shock .
ALMA: How so ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The plot 's a muddle . Some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did etter hundreds of years ago in The Lady Vanishes . And your villain is weak . But the biggest failure is the relationship etween the hero and heroine . He picks up a radish and bites into it .
ALMA: How would you know what really goes on etween a man and a woman ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Look at this mess .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
SET HAND: Tell the boss we 're ready .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What 's the hold-up ? Call time was two hours ago .
JANET LEIGH: And you 're sure this moleskin will stay put ?
RITA RIGGS: Mr. Hitchcock promised .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
JANET LEIGH: It better . I 'm going to be taking a shower all week .
ALMA: Forget what Hitch said . He 's just feeling his age . He 'll come around .
WHITFIELD COOK: But he 's right . It does need more feeling . Alma ponders the problem . Finally
ALMA: So why do n't we put some in ? She gets to her feet and starts to pace
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Good morning .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Ah . There 's our murderess .
TO JANET: Are you ready for our little bloodbath ?
JANET LEIGH: My mother always said , `` Have confidence in yourself and you can lick anything . ''
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: My mother used to say the same thing .
THEN: Let 's go for a take . Quiet everyone .
LEAPING UP: Cut . Cut camera .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
CREW MEMBER: Ready , sir .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Print . We 've got it . He exits quickly .
ED GEIN: You just ca n't keep this stuff bottled up .
PEGGY: Oh God
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
WHITFIELD COOK: What if Helen and Michael try and get into the cab at the same time ?
ALMA: Even better , what if they reached for the cab door at exactly the same time ? Alma demonstrates so that their hands touch .
WHITFIELD COOK: That feels better already . Finally , the phone intrudes .
ALMA: Are you going to get that ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
PEGGY: I know you told me only to call in an emergency , but I 'm not sure how else to describe this .
MARTIN BALSAM: It 's official . The inmates are running the asylum . Peggy hands Hilton the phone .
PEGGY: Hilton . I have Mr. Hitchcock for you .
HILTON GREEN: Hey there , Hitch . We 're still working on it . ( looking over at the
CONTINUING ARGUMENT: Everyone misses you .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I 've told Peggy and now I 'm going to tell you . You have to get this sequence shot today . What 's the hold up ?
HILTON GREEN: We tried it ten different ways and it looks terrible . Why do n't we use inserts ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No . It has to be a high angle . You 'll tip off the big surprise ! Just get the process shot . Hitch slams down the phone .
ALMA: No more phone calls . You 're burning up .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Burning up our money . We 're two days ehind and I 'm stuck in bed . Hitch swings his legs out of the bed .
ALMA: Where do you think you 're going ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: To the set . We ca n't afford to lose any more time . Two more days of this and the whole production goes under . He shakily tries to get to his feet .
ALMA: You stay in bed . I 'll deal with it .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I 'd hate to take you away from you writing partner .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Under the blankets . Now .
PEGGY: One seventy three .
ALMA: Storyboards ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What do you mean ?
ED GEIN: My mother always said if you 're going to do a job , do it right .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Barney .
BARNEY BALABAN: Alma .
BARNEY: You know David Kirkpatrick . He 's working on Jerry Lewis ' next picture .
ALMA: That wo n't be necessary .
BARNEY: But you 're nearly three days behind .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
BARNEY BALABAN: Alma . We both know what kind of film this is . The smart thing to do would be to help Hitch finish it .
ALMA: Thank you for your concern , Barney .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Mrs. Hitchcock ?
JANET: I hope you do n't mind . I heard Hitch was sick so I got him a little something .
ALMA: That 's kind of you .
JANET: Well , he 's been very considerate with me .
A BEAT: I have n't always had that from my directors .
ALMA: Janet , you 've been very professional . It has n't gone unappreciated .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: May I turn that down ? She silences the stereo . Hitch does n't react .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We 're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget .
ALMA: I already cancelled the wrap party . That 'll save us two thousand right there . And you wo n't be tempted by any champagne and cake .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Beware all men are potential murderers . She yanks it from his grip .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Alright , what 's this about ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Spending a lot of time at the beach ?
ALMA: That 's where Whit and I are writing . He 's ented a place .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions .
ALMA: Actually , it 's very conducive to creative collaboration .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I already told you that treatment is a waste of time .
ALMA: Did n't everyone say the same thing about `` Psycho '' ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Are you and Whit having an affair ?
ALMA: Do n't be absurd . He 's working on something new and needs a little help , that 's all .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What a coincidence . I 'm working on something new and I could use a little help too .
ALMA: What do you think I 've been doing ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage , talentless mamma 's boy ?
ALMA: Because it 's fun . He quivers , livid .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I am under extraordinary pressures on this picture , the least you can do is give me your full support .
ALMA: Full support ? We 've mortgaged our house . My house .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
VERA MILES: Free at last .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Well , Vera . You always make it look so easy .
VERA MILES: Oh , it was nothing , Hitch . I just faked it .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Why did n't you stay with me ? I would have made you as big a star as Grace Kelly .
VERA MILES: Unlike Grace Kelly , I can pick up my dry cleaning . I 've got a family , Hitch . A home . That will always mean more to me than all of this .
THEN: That blonde woman of mystery you 're after ? She 's a fantasy . She does n't exist . He studies her a moment .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: There was a time when I thought I understood you so completely understood women .
WHITFIELD COOK: Alma , I thought you were coming late tonight .
ALMA: I thought you rented this place so we could write .
WHITFIELD COOK: I did . I swear this just happened .
ALMA: Do n't worry . I wo n't tell Elizabeth .
WHITFIELD COOK: I mean to Hitch . Whit smiles feebly .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: Oh , I would n't worry about that , Whit . She starts the car and drives off .
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: You 're going to have to cut all that nudity .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What nudity ? It was suggested .
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: I definitely saw that knife jabbing her .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We did no such shot .
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: I 'd stake my reputation on it . I 'm ecommending you cut the shower scene entirely . Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I 'll go over it frame by frame and set up another screening . But Shurlock is already walking away
LEW WASSERMAN: Let 's just say it was a four-lette eview and it was n't ` good ' . The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock .
ALMA: Is there anything else we can do ?
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ACCOUNTANT: We 'll just have to wait and see how the movie turns out .
ALMA: Well , it is only a house .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ED GEIN: This is my favorite place . I just shut the doors and leave the world behind .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Do n't you get lonely out here sometimes ?
ED GEIN: I can always talk to my mother .
ED GEIN: They ca n't go in there . That 's my mother 's room
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
CALLING OUT: That 's my mother 's room ! !
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: An odd little movie . Of course , Colbert is wonderful . Alma nods . They watch for a beat longer .
ALMA: Cold and miserable .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Just like Barney Balaban 's face .
PAUSE: And neither am I .
THEN: There 's no other way to say it It 's stillborn . ALMA turns away .
ALMA: I do n't think I can stand both of us eing maudlin .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Except for you .
ALMA: You 'll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after she 's supposed to be dead .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We 've seen the footage a thousand times . She does n't blink . Alma gives him a look
ALMA: Take thirty frames off the head
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No , no , the second take , the light is etter on his hands .
ALMA: Only cut back to Janet once the car 's already moving .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Cut it tighter . The minute I lose one person I 've lost the whole audience .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: You imp . You got nudity in there .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Her breasts are very large , dear . It was a challenge not to show them .
GEORGE TOMASINI: I 'll be damned . She did blink .
FLACK: How 's it going in there with Mr. Herrmann ?
PEGGY: Swimmingly .
FLACK: Everyone 's saying it 's a dog with fleas .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I do n't want music in the showe murder .
BERNARD HERRMANN: But what Alma and I talked about is eally going to play .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No . This is n't Vertigo , Bernie . This is different . The images have to work on their own .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: You ca n't scare people just by going , `` Boo ! '' You have to tell them what 's coming , make them anticipate it
FLACK: Thank God we 've got Cinderfella for the holidays .
GEORGE TOMASINI: What do you think ?
PEGGY: I think I 'm never going to take a showe again .
GEORGE TOMASINI: Hitch ? They look at him
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It 's getting there .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: I told you , I distinctly saw both the stabbing and the nudity . We 're denying your seal , Mr. Hitchcock .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I take your opinion very seriously . But what you think you 're seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion . I assure you that once you view the final version with Mr. Herrmann 's lovely , lyrical score
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: A `` lyrical score '' wo n't change my opinion . All that innuendo and half-naked groping really , Hitch .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Would you mind if we had a word in private , Geoffrey ?
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: My specifications ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: If only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency .
PEGGY: He 's been harassing you since you announced this project , you invite him to the set , and he does n't even show up ? What did you tell him ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: That I respected him . Deeply . Peggy laughs . Now she understands .
JANET LEIGH: I thought we were reshooting the scene .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No need . The charade is over .
JANET LEIGH: Not at all .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Worthy of a Purple Heart , my dear .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I hope you do n't mind , I told Mrs. Bates she could have your dressing room .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We have our seal from Shurlock 's office .
DEVILISHLY: Now , we lead the lambs to the slaughter . Hitch turns to Lew for the latest news .
LEW WASSERMAN: The front office confirmed . They 're only opening the movie in two theatres , as we suspected . And no premiere . If we do n't get word of mouth we 're dead .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Then we 'd better get started . Peggy , take a memo Peggy whips out her steno pad .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: a fire escape or through a skylight , you will be ejected by brute force .
ALMA: More playful , darling .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
BARNEY BALABAN: `` Absolutely never , ever will I allow anything to follow Psycho no previews of coming attractions , no newsreel , no short subject and certainly no double- feature . Sincerely , and , emphatically , Alfred Hitchcock . ''
ALMA: Well , at least there are some people here .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
THEATER MANAGER: Right this way , Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock . Hitchcock turns to Alma .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Ready for the gallows ?
LEW WASSERMAN: We 've roped off some seats for you .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You go on ahead .
ALMA: Are you sure ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I 'll join you in a minute . Off Alma 's look .
ALMA: Fine , darling . I 'll save you a seat .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: But they 're laughing too much .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I promised Mother I would n't tell .
THEATER MANAGER: Mr. Hitchcock , what do I do now that my wife wo n't take a shower after seeing your movie ?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Have her dry-cleaned . Laughter as Lew appears .
LEW WASSERMAN: I just got off the phone with Balaban . I could n't resist telling him we 're sold out for the next two weeks .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What did he say ?
LEW WASSERMAN: He said `` Tell Hitch congratulations . A well deserved triumph as we always knew . ''
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: `` As we always knew '' The two friends a look .
PEGGY: Does this mean I can take the weekend off now ? Hitch playfully shrugs , `` we 'll see '' .
THEATRE MANAGER: I 'm sorry , Mr. Hithcock but there are photographers outside . They heard you were here .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALMA: This could be the biggest hit of you career , Alfred .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Our career , Alma .
ALMA: You do realize I 've been waiting decades to hear you say that . He gives her a gentle peck .
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And that , madame , is why they call me `` The Master of Suspense '' He helps her into the car .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ORDERLY: Guess what I 'm doing this weekend ?
ATTENDANT: What ?
ORDERLY: Claudine and I are driving to Chicago with her folks to see that Psycho movie .
CHET: I think you 're the happiest guy I 've eve known , Ed . How you do it ?
ED GEIN: I 'll tell you . You live your life , and it 's unbearable sometimes but there 's this secret , Chet ; a big secret no one else knows or wants to tell there is a God and he 's so big and powerful , he does n't always remembe you 're there He takes a huge bite blueberry pie .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And so , gentle viewer , Psycho the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin was such a hit that Alma and I got to Well , let 's just say that we got to keep our house and the swimming pool . And the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements .
CONTINUED: CONTINUED
GUIDE VOICE: It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem .
ARTHUR: What do you mean he 's gone out to lunch ? You just said he was still at breakfast ! MR. PROSSER , a bureaucrat , leans over him .
PROSSER: Come off it , Mr. Dent . You ca n't lie in front of the bulldozers forever .
ARTHUR: I 'm game . We 'll see who rusts first .
PROSSER: This bypass has got to be built and it 's going to be built . You should have made your protest months ago .
ARTHUR: The first I heard of it was when a workman came yesterday . I asked if he 'd come to clean the windows , and he said he 'd come to demolish the house . He did n't tell me ight away of course . First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid . Then he told me .
PROSSER: Look . These plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year .
ARTHUR: On display ? I had to go down to a cellar !
PROSSER: That 's the display department .
ARTHUR: I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard ' .
PROSSER: Mr. Dent , have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you ?
ARTHUR: How much ?
PROSSER: None at all .
ARTHUR: Ford ? He leaps off , drags the cart to a full stop .
FORD: Arthur ! There you are . Here drink and eat with me . We need to talk .
ARTHUR: Er , umnow 's not the best time , Ford They 're going to demolish my home ,
FORD: Whoa . You already know ? How ? Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer .
ARTHUR: But what about my house ?
FORD: C'mon . Let 's go to the pub . He said they wo n't destroy your house until they 've finished the beers .
ARTHUR: Can we trust him ?
FORD: I 'd trust him to the end of the Earth .
ARTHUR: And how far 's that ?
FORD: About twelve minutes away .
BARMAN: Oh yes , sir ? Nice weather for it .
ARTHUR: Well , when does he get back from lunch ? Or is he going straight out for tea ? ! He shuts the phone , sits , looking forlorn .
FORD: It 's about to get a lot crappier .
BARMAN: There you are , six pints .
FORD: Keep the change . You 've got ten minutes to spend it . Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur .
ARTHUR: Three ? At lunchtime ?
FORD: Time is an illusion . Lunchtime doubly so .
ARTHUR: Very deep . You should send that in to the Reader 's Digest . They 've got a page fo people like you .
FORD: Drink up .
ARTHUR: Why three pints ?
FORD: Muscle relaxant . And eat these . You 'll need the salt .
ARTHUR: What 's going on . Ford ?
FORD: What would you say if I told you I was n't eally from Guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Eetelgeuse ?
ARTHUR: Why , is it the sort of thing you 're likely to say ?
FORD: Remember when we met ? That car was racing toward me , I was trying to greet it , you pushed me out of the way ?
ARTHUR: I assumed you were drunk .
FORD: I thought cars were the dominant life form . I was trying to introduce myself .
ARTHUR: And that 's why you 're named after a discontinued car from the seventies ?
FORD: You saved my life that day . Now I 'm saving yours .
ARTHUR: This must be Thursday . I never could get the hang of Thursdays .
FORD: Look , if it 's about your house
ARTHUR: No , it 's not that . It 's .
FORD: This is n't a long story , is it ? We 've only got six minutes .
ARTHUR: At that flat in Islington . I told you about it . Last week , remember ?
TRICIA: No , I mean who are you ?
ARTHUR: Oh , the costume . Right . Er , um Livingston , I presume . Granted . Not as clever as Darwin , but the est I could do on short notice .
TRICIA: You 're the first person who 's got it ight . Everyone keeps calling me Sherlock .
ARTHUR: Really ? I thought the beagle made it ather obvious .
ARTHUR: Really ? I thought the beagle made it ather obvious .
TRICIA: I 've got so many degrees I am officially unemployable . Let 's drink to that !
ARTHUR: Yeah . It is a bit noisy . There 's a lovely little cafe around the corner
TRICIA: I was thinking Madagascar .
ARTHUR: Is that a new club on Dean Street ?
TRICIA: No . It 's a country . Off the coast of Africa .
ARTHUR: Oh , that Madagascar . Right , off we go then . Good God , you 're serious .
TRICIA: Quit . Get a new one when we return .
ARTHUR: I ca n't justwhat about my house ? Who would feed my dog ?
TRICIA: Bring him with .
ARTHUR: He 's a Welsh Collie . He 'd feel all out of place in Madagascar .
FORD: More popular than you 'd think .
ARTHUR: I 've left messages , sent letters It 's like she 's vanished off the face of the earth .
FORD: Hey , it happens . Speaking of We 've got two minutes . So drink up .
ARTHUR: My house !
FORD: A round for everyone , on me .
BARMAN: You really think the world 's going to end ? Should n't we lie down or put a bag ove our heads or something ?
FORD: If you want .
BARMAN: Will it help ?
FORD: Not really .
BARMAN: Last orders , then ?
FORD: Ships from a Vogon Constructor Fleet . I picked up their signal this morning .
FORD {CONT'D}: Here . You 'll need this .
JELTZ: and , unfortunately , your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition . The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes . Thank you .
TECHNICIAN: Hello ! Can you hear us ? Please respond !
VOGON CAPTAIN: What do you mean you 've never been to Alpha Centauri ? Oh , for heaven 's sake mankind , it 's only four light years away you know . I 'm sorry , but if you ca n't be othered to take an interest in local affairs that 's your own lookout .
JELTZ: Apathetic bloody planet , I 've no sympathy at all . Energize the demolition beams .
GUIDE VOICE: The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book
ARTHUR: So you 're not from Guilford , which would explain the accent which I 've always wondered aboutand you 're not an out of work actor but rather a writer fo thisthisbook thing . Ford nods . Arthur rubs his weary brow .
FORD: Here . Eat these . If you 've never been through a transmat beam before you 've probably lost some salt and protein .
ARTHUR: If I asked where we were would I regret
FORD: We 're safe . For now .
ARTHUR: Good .
ARTHUR: Obviously some strange usage of the word safe I was n't previously aware of .
FORD: Is it ?
ARTHUR: Tell me you 're joking .
FORD: Okay . I 'm joking .
ARTHUR: And do a reassuring little laugh . Ford does a reassuring little laugh .
FORD: In the storage hold of a Vogon constructo ship .
ARTHUR: Get me home . Ford .
FORD: Home ? Arthuryour home is
ARTHUR: Oh God - it was demolished ! I 've got to each my lawyer ! He must be back from lunch by now
FORD: You do n't remember , do you ? Okay . I 've got something to tell you . It ai n't gon na be easy , but you 're gon na have to just deal , okay ?
ARTHUR: Good god . Is this really the interior of a flying saucer ?
FORD: Yeah . Why ?
ARTHUR: Blown up ? BLOWN UP ? ! Could n't you have done something ? ! !
FORD: I did . I saved you .
ARTHUR: But there 's six billion other people .
FORD: And all those ants .
ARTHUR: Yes , but ants are n't exactly people !
FORD: And now you 're thinking like a Vogon . I saved your life , okay ? Which makes us even . Next thing .
ARTHUR: What 's a Vogon ?
FORD: Ask the guide . Say `` Vogons . ''
ARTHUR: `` Vogons . ''
GUIDE VOICE: Vogons .
FORD: They ca n't think , they ca n't imagine , most of them ca n't even spell . They just run things . And if we do n't get a ride soon , you wo n't need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the Vogons can be . They 've destroyed a planet today , that always makes them a little feisty .
ARTHUR: It ca n't be gone . It ca n't be ! ( grabbing the Guide , shouting } Earth !
FORD: Shhh !
ARTHUR: EARTH ! !
GUIDE VOICE: Earth .
ARTHUR: That 's it ? That 's all this idiotic book has to say about my home ? `` Harmless ? ''
FORD: Hey , there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book 's microprocessors . No one knew much about Earth . That 's why I was there . To expand the entry . I fired off a new one to the editor before I got stranded .
ARTHUR: What does it say now ?
FORD: Mostly harmless .
ARTHUR: Ahhh , what the hell is that ? !
FORD: Here . Put this in your ear .
FORD: The fish . It 's translating for you .
VOGON GUARD: Resistance is useless !
GUIDE VOICE: The Babelfish is small , yellow , leechlike , and probably the oddest thing in the Universe .
VOGON GUARD: Resistance is useless !
ARTHUR: Ford
FORD: Do n't panic . If we 're lucky , they 'll throw us out into space .
ARTHUR: And if we 're unlucky ? Off Ford 's apprehensive look we CUT TO
JELTZ: Oh freddled gruntbuggly ! Thy suppurations are to me as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee .
GUIDE VOICE: Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe .
JELTZ: Or I shall rend thee In the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheaon , see if I do n't !
GUIDE VOICE: The absolute worst poetry was written by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix . It involved decaying swans . Luckily , it was destroyed when the Earth was .
JELTZ: So , Earthlings , I present you with a simple choice . Either die in the vacuum of space , or tell what you thought of my poem .
ARTHUR: ActuallyI rather liked it .
FORD: Good tact . Run with it .
ARTHUR: Umsome of the words I did n't understand , ut I found the imagery quite effective .
JELTZ: Continue . . .
ARTHUR: And , um , interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity
FORD: Vogonity !
ARTHUR: Vogonity , sorry . Vogonity of the poet 's soul , which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate , er
FORD: whatever it was
ARTHUR: the poem was about .
FORD: Damn .
ARTHUR: What ?
FORD: I think you just saved my life again .
JELTZ: An astute analysis . Very impressive . Throw them off the ship .
VOGON GUARD: Resistance is useless !
JELTZ: Hmph . `` Counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor '' Death 's too good for them .
ARTHUR: So this is it ? We 're going to die ?
FORD: Yes . No , wait ! What 's this switch ? No , it 's nothing . We are going to die .
ARTHUR: You know , it 's at times like this , when I 'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I 'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young .
FORD: Why ? What did you she tell you ?
ARTHUR: I do n't know . I did n't listen .
FORD: You 're sweating .
GUIDE VOICE: `` Space '' says the introduction to the Hitchhikers Guide , `` is big . Really big . You just wo n't believe how vastly , hugely mind-bogglingly big it is . I mean , you may think it 's a long way down the road to the market , but that 's just peanuts compared to space '' and so on .
ARTHUR: Ford
FORD: Yes ?
ARTHUR: I think I 'm a sofa .
FORD: I think I know how you feel .
TRILLIAN: Four to one against and falling
ZAPHOD: Hey . Do you mind ? I ca n't hear .
TRILLIAN: Can we put your ego aside for one moment ? Something important has happened .
ZAPHOD: If there 's anything more important than my ego on this ship , I want it caught and shot now . He turns back to the TV and turns it up .
GAG HALFRRUNT: Vell , Zaphod 's just zis guy , you know
ZAPHOD: Hey
TRILLIAN: We have a couple of hitchhikers in ou eceiving bay .
ZAPHOD: Huh ?
TRILLIAN: When you engaged the Improbability Drive .
ZAPHOD: I did n't engage the drive .
TRILLIAN: We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha where you picked me up .
ZAPHOD: That 's impossible .
TRILLIAN: No . Just very , very improbable .
ZAPHOD: I do n't have time for this ! We 've got the police of half the Galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers ? ! Okay , so ten out of ten for style , but minus several million for good thinking , eh ?
TRILLIAN: Do n't . I 'll send Marvin . Marvin !
MARVIN: I think you ought to know I 'm feeling very depressed .
TRILLIAN: We have something to take your mind off things .
MARVIN: It wo n't work , I have an exceptionally large mind .
TRILLIAN: I know . Go down to the number two entry ay and bring the two aliens up here .
MARVIN: Just that ?
TRILLIAN: Yes .
MARVIN: I wo n't enjoy it .
ZAPHOD: She 's not asking you to enjoy it . Just do it will you ?
MARVIN: All right . I 'll do it .
TRILLIAN: No , no , Marvin , it 's fine really . It 's just part of life .
MARVIN: Life . Do n't talk to me about life .
DOOR: Mmmmmyaaahhhhhh !
VOGON CAPTAIN: Commander Kwaltz . We 've located the spaceship Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox . Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha . Requesting hyperspace clearance .
KWALTZ: Get me the vice-president .
ARTHUR: Now this is more like my idea of a spaceship . Look at all these buttons
FORD: Shhh . They listen . Hear footsteps .
DOOR: Thank you for using this door . I 've enjoyed opening for you . Hhmmyaahh
DOOR: What a pleasure it is to open for you . I will gladly close for you now . The door closes .
MARVIN: `` All the doors in this spacecraft have a cheerful and sunny disposition . It is their pleasure to open for you , and thei satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done .
ARTHUR: GPP ?
MARVIN: `` Genuine People Personalities . '' I 'm a personality prototype . You can tell ca n't you ?
ARTHUR: Er . . .
MARVIN: Sorry , did I say something wrong ? Pardon me for breathing , which I never do anyway , so I do n't know why I even bother to say it . Oh god , I 'm so depressed . They round a corner
ARTHUR: Really ? Wonder why ?
FORD: Probably because he 's so negative .
ARTHUR: Yes , I know . I was beingnever mind . They continue on .
MARVIN: I 've brought the aliens . Do n't thank me or anything .
ZAPHOD: Freeze !
MARVIN: Do you mean sit in a corner and rust o just fall apart where I 'm standing ?
ZAPHOD: I was n't talking to you .
FORD: Zaphod ?
ZAPHOD: Ixxie ? It is you ! IXXIE !
FORD: I do n't know ! Just stuck out the thum and here I am .
ZAPHOD: That is so you .
FORD: And look at you ! President ? Last time I saw you , you were a beach bum .
ZAPHOD: Is it a great galaxy or what ? I still ca n't believe this . Ixxie ! Here !
FORD: Hey , it 's Ford now .
ZAPHOD: Hmm ?
FORD: My name . It 's Ford Prefect . Picked it up on Earth . Sorta grew on me .
ZAPHOD: Okay `` Ford '' you zarking frood .
FORD: Oh , this is Arthur . Arthur , this is Zaphod Beeblebrox . My cousin ? Semi-half other ?
ZAPHOD: He shares three of the same mothers as me .
ARTHUR: We 've met .
ZAPHOD: Have we ? Sorry . I 've got a terrible memory for species . Before Arthur can explain , Trillian enters .
TRILLIAN: Everything okay ?
ZAPHOD: Hey , hon . Come here . You wo n't believe this . Ixum , sorry '' Ford '' this is
ARTHUR: Tricia McMillan ? She takes a closer look at him .
TRILLIAN: Arthur ?
ARTHUR: I ca n't believe thisI 've been lookingand you 're here ? I went to get wine and
TRILLIAN: I know . And it was rude to just leave , ut I told you I wanted to get away , and he had a spaceship parked outside , well , honestly I assumed you were a sort of stay-at-home-and-read-a book type . But you 're here
ARTHUR: Actually I am that type . Butwell you do know what happened , do n't you ?
ZAPHOD: Ford picked him up , they hitched a ride , and here we all are . Now , enough small talk , Trill . We 're on the run , remember ? I stole a ship ?
ARTHUR: We 're having a bit of a chat if you do n't mind .
FORD: There 's the Zaphod I remember .
TRILLIAN: Are you all right ?
ARTHUR: I feel like a bloody idiot . I 've spent all week looking for Tricia McMillan and that is n't even your name .
TRILLIAN: It is my name . I shortened it .
ARTHUR: Well , I 'm still Arthur . Just plain average one-headed doesn't-own-a-space ship Arthur . Sorry to disappoint .
TRILLIAN: Computer ?
EDDIE: Hi , guys , this is Eddie your shipboard computer and I just know I 'm gon na get a undle of kicks out of any program you want to run through me .
TRILLIAN: Can you identify our pursuers ?
EDDIE: I 'd be happy to ! Stand by , please . Hey , guys , I 'm just pleased as punch to eport that it 's a fleet of a hundred Vogon Battle Destroyers . You must be super important to warrant such an effort , and gee am I impressed . They 're sending a message . I 'd be supe happy to play it .
FORD: Brace yourself . This is a bit like being drunk .
ARTHUR: What 's so bad about being drunk ?
FORD: Ask a glass of water .
KWALTZ: Did they have proper hyperspace authorization ?
VOGON WORKER: No , Commander .
KWALTZ: Add that to their list of offences ! Blatant disregard for protocol .
QUESTULAR: You do realize he did what he did because he knew this is what you would do .
KWALTZ: Rules are rules , Mr. Vice President . And they are made to be followed .
QUESTULAR: Do n't you think this many ships is a bit , oh I do n't know excessive ?
KWALTZ: The provisions are clear . Unde subsection 37a these are the forces we deploy to protect the president in the case of an attempted or actual kidnapping-
QUESTULAR: You are aware , Commander , that the President kidnapped himself .
KWALTZ: Hence
QUESTULAR: Do you have any idea how ridiculous this is ?
KWALTZ: I do n't have ideas Mr. Vice President . I just do what I do .
ZAPHOD: So you along for the ride or am I dropping you somewhere ?
FORD: Depends . Where you going ?
ZAPHOD: Into the pages of history , cousin . And when you see what I 'm about to show you , you 'll beg me to take you with us .
TRILLIAN: You okay ?
ARTHUR: Normally I would say `` I 'll live , '' but given the circumstances Is there any tea on this spaceship ?
TRILLIAN: This way .
ZAPHOD: Hey , apeman . Earthman . I 'm sorry , what was your name again ?
ARTHUR: Arthur .
ZAPHOD: Right . No hard feelings , okay ? And sorry to hear about your planet , but do n't mention it to the girl because if you do I'llI 'll
FORD: Two heads . Interesting choice .
ZAPHOD: Apparently you ca n't be President with a whole brain .
FORD: So you carved it up ?
ZAPHOD: Yes I think . And I think I did it in such a way that it would n't be detected by the Government screening tests or by me . So , what 's so secret that I ca n't let anybody know I know it , not the Galactic Government , not even myself ? And the answer is I do n't know . Obviously . But I put a few things together and that 's when I ealized I had this .
TRILLIAN: I suppose I should have said it esembles tea .
ARTHUR: So two heads is what does it for a girl , then ? I mean , if I 'd had two heads . O three ?
TRILLIAN: Or your own space ship .
ARTHUR: Anything else he 's got two of ?
TRILLIAN: Come on , Arthur , do n't be like that .
ARTHUR: Well , what am I supposed to be like ? Green ? Bleeping ? What ?
TRILLIAN: Just be yourself . Have some fun . Does it hurt ?
ARTHUR: No , I suppose it wouldn't..
TRILLIAN: I mean
ARTHUR: So all that 's left is me and you , `` mostly harmless , '' and two lab rats . She furrows her brow . What does he mean ?
TRILLIAN: Can it keep ? You might want to see this .
ZAPHOD: and when I saw what I 'm about to show you , that 's when I realized why I did what I did to my brain or it least , I think that 's why .
DEEP THOUGHT: What is this great task for which I , Deep Thought , the second greatest computer of all time have been called into existence ?
LUNKWILL: Your task , O computer
FOOK: Hang on . Did you say second greatest ?
DEEP THOUGHT: Second greatest . Yes .
FOOK: But we designed you to be the greatest computer so you could
LUNKWILL: You 're not talking about the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond ?
DEEP THOUGHT: The Milliard Gargantubrain ? A mere abacus , mention it not .
FOOK: The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then ?
DEEP THOUGHT: The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could argue all four legs off an Arcturan Megadonkey , but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards .
FOOK: Then what 's the problem ?
DEEP THOUGHT: I am the greatest computer you are able to design without my help . Which , one day , you are going to need .
LUNKWILL: Let 's just ask the question .
FOOK: Oh Deep Thought , your task is this . We want you to tell us the Answer .
DEEP THOUGHT: The Answerto what ?
LUNKWILL: You know . The answer . To Lifethe UniverseEverything .
FOOK: We 'd really like an answer . Something simple . Can you do it ?
DEEP THOUGHT: The Ultimate Question of Life , the Universe and Everything . Yes . There is an answer . But I 'll have to think about it .
FORD: That 's it ?
ZAPHOD: No , no . There 's more . They go back .
ARTHUR: Seven and a half million years later ?
DEEP THOUGHT: Can I help you ?
FOOK: Deep Thought . Do you have
DEEP THOUGHT: An answer for you ? Yes . I have .
FOOK: There really is an answer ?
DEEP THOUGHT: Yes . There really is one .
FOOK: Oh !
LUNKWILL: Can you tell us what it is ?
DEEP THOUGHT: Yes . Though I do n't think you 're going to like it .
FOOK: Does n't matter ! We must know it !
DEEP THOUGHT: You 're really not going to like it .
FOOK: Tell us !
DEEP THOUGHT: Alright . The answer to the ultimate question
LUNKWILL: Yes
DEEP THOUGHT: of Life , the Universe , and Everything
FOOK: Yes !
DEEP THOUGHT: is
CROWD: Yes !
DEEP THOUGHT: Forty two .
LUNKWILL: But it was the Question . The Ultimate Question !
DEEP THOUGHT: Yes , but what actually is it ?
LUNKWILL: Give us the Ultimate Question then ! !
DEEP THOUGHT: I ca n't . But there is one who can . A computer that is to come after me , one that I will design . A computer to calculate the Ultimate Question , one of such infinite complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix . And you yourselves shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program . I shall design this computer for you . And it shall be called
FORD: That 's it ?
ZAPHOD: That 's it .
FORD: You 're looking for the Ultimate Question ?
ZAPHOD: Yep .
FORD: You .
ZAPHOD: Me .
FORD: Why ?
ZAPHOD: No , I tried that . `` Why ? '' `` Forty-two . '' Does n't work . Let 's get her ready , babe .
FORD: I mean , why do you want to know the Ultimate Question ?
ZAPHOD: Oh . Well partly the curiosity , partly a sense of adventure , but mostly I think it 's for the fame and the money .
ARTHUR: But you 're President of the Galaxy , are n't you ?
ZAPHOD: Yes , Arman .
ARTHUR: Arthur .
ZAPHOD: Whatever . Presidential fame is temporary , I find the Question , that 's permanent . It sticks . Plus everyone thinks you 're deep . Win-win .
FORD: But you do n't know the name of the computer that other computer was talking about .
ZAPHOD: Which is why I 'm going there .
FORD: Where ?
ZAPHOD: There . To find Deep Thought . On Magrathea .
FORD: Magrathea ! ? Magrathea is a myth , a legend
ZAPHOD: No , it is n't . It 's real , cousin . And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there .
FORD: You mean to tell me you carved up you ain so you could become President so you would get invited to the launching ceremony of this shipso you could steal it so you could go to Magrathea which , according to most sane people , does n't even exist ?
ZAPHOD: Yep .
FORD: Beautiful .
ARTHUR: Why this ship ? What 's so special about it ? Zaphod thinks again hard .
ZAPHOD: I do n't seem to be letting myself in on any of my secrets .
FORD: Infinite Improbability Drive ? So they
ZAPHOD: Exactly . And I 'm guessing if we hit that utton we go to Magrathea .
ARTHUR: You 're guessing ?
ZAPHOD: Hey , anyone who 's not up for that , there 's the door . Now who 's in ?
FORD: For a trip to a place that does n't exist ? I 'm in . My editor will think I 'm crazy , ut what the hell he already thinks I 'm dead .
TRILLIAN: Definitely . I 'm in .
ARTHUR: Do I even have a choice ? Zaphod smiles , all bright and cheery .
ZAPHOD: No ! Arthur looks at the button .
ARTHUR: What exactly does an Infinite Improbability Drive do ? Suddenly , Zaphod 's Head 2 shoots up !
GUIDE VOICE: The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new method of crossing vast interstella distances without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace . As soon as the drive eaches Infinite Improbability , it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously , then selects the appropriate re-entry point . The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotte suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer , say a nice hot cup of tea , were of course well understood .
KWALTZ: Well , Captain ?
GUIDE VOICE: Many respectable physicists said they were n't going to stand for that sort of thing partly because it was a debasement of science , but mostly because they did n't get invited to those sort of parties .
VOGON CAPTAIN: We had them sir . These are the coordinates . But they 're not here .
KWALTZ: I can see that . WHERE ARE THEY ?
KNITTED ZAPHOD: Is this going to happen every time we hit that button ?
KNITTED TRILLIAN: Very probably , yes .
ARTHUR: Did it work ? Are we there ? Now Zaphod looks and he 's elated .
ZAPHOD: Yes ! I think . Computer ?
EDDIE: Hi , fella ! Head 2 suddenly springs up .
TRILLIAN: Computer ? What planet is that , please ?
EDDIE: CHECKING ! !
ARTHUR: OW ! ! Did you just pluck a hair from my head ?
EDDIE: Thanks for waiting , everyone . I 'm just tickled pink to tell you we are currently in orbit around the planet Viltvodle 6 .
VOGON CAPTAIN: Sir , the Heart of Gold has just requested permission to land on Viltvodle 6 . Should I pursue ?
KWALTZ: Bring me the request to pursue fugitive forms .
QUESTULAR: This is ridiculous ! What do you need , an executive order ? Fine . I order you . Stop doing this ! Go and get him !
KWALTZ: According to Subsection 94b , paragraph 2 , you 're not authorized to make such an order .
QUESTULAR: But I 'm acting president !
KWALTZ: Then act like a president , and do nothing .
ARTHUR: Why does he keep saying that ?
TRILLIAN: I do n't know . I 'm not used to seeing him this way .
ARTHUR: You mean fully clothed ? She stops , fires him a look .
TRILLIAN: Clearly unlike any guy I 've ever met . Look , if you 're going to pout your way around space , then maybe you should just go home .
ARTHUR: I ca n't . That 's the whole point and I 've been trying to tell you
FORD: Hey , look what I found in the guide .
ARTHUR: She deserves to know .
FORD: But if you tell her and she ends up with you because you 're literally the last guy on Earth you 'll always doubt he intentions . Arthur considers this . Nods .
ARTHUR: Do I need it ?
FORD: Only always .
GUIDE VOICE: In the beginning , the universe was created . This made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move . Zaphod continues several steps ahead of them .
ZAPHOD: I 'll handle this .
HUMMA KAVULA: The handkerchief is coming , beloveds . Are you ready ? Let us pray that the almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us .
ZAPHOD: Hello , Humma .
ARTHUR: That 's Humma Kavula ? I thought he was just using a swear word .
FORD: Humma Kavula was his opponent in the election . Something happened during the campaign . Zaphod never forgave him .
ARTHUR: What was it ?
HUMMA KAVULA: Send the handkerchief , lord , so that it may wipe us clean . We ask this in you precious holy name
CONGREGATION: Achoo .
HUMMA KAVULA: Bless you .
ZAPHOD: I think you know why I 'm here .
HUMMA KAVULA: I do n't think I do .
ZAPHOD: Oh , I think you think you do n't , but we oth know you do .
HUMMA KAVULA: Elequent as always , Zaphod . Your ability to communicate a clear thought neve ceases to amaze .
HUMKA KAVULA: Interesting . And I do n't know what you 're talking about .
HUMMA KAVULA: This Humma you speak of no longer exists . He came here in his consolation position as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an ideological threat to the system and epented from his wicked ways . He now goes by the holy name Tazelo the Unceasingly Righteous , given to him by his devoted followers .
ZAPHOD: Thank you .
ARTHUR: Why do I get the feeling he 's going to get us all killed ?
FORD: Probably because it 's very possible . Just do n't save me , okay ? We 're even .
HUMMA KAVULA: The election is ancient history , Zaphod , ut if memory serves you won , proving that good looks and charm win ove illiance and ability to govern .
ZAPHOD: That 's really not the point .
HUMMA KAVULA: You have n't come halfway across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge . Why are you here , Zaphod ?
ZAPHOD: I do n't know . I was headed for Magrathea , I ended up here .
HUMMA KAVULA: How very , very improbable .
ZAPHOD: What ?
HUMMA KAVULA: A gun .
ZAPHOD: A gun ?
HUMMA KAVULA: A very special gun . Designed by the greatest computer ever invented , now uried in the bowels of Magrathea .
ZAPHOD: Fine . I 'll get your gun . Just give me the coordinates . Zaphod reaches out . Humma pulls it back .
HUMMA KAVULA: And what will you give me to insure you eturn ?
ZAPHOD: My word as President .
HUMMA KAVULA: Ha ! I 'd be better off with the dung of a Bethusian Mega Donkey .
ZAPHOD: Okay , then I 'll get you that .
HUMMA KAVULA: I need a hostage , something you hold dear . Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure ?
ARTHUR: Are we sure this is the right way ?
FORD: Yes ! I think . I do n't know . Maybe not .
ARTHUR: Yes , thank you for clearing that up .
CROWD: Mr. President ! Zaphod , over here ! I want to have your baby ! , etc
FORD: Back to the ship . Quickly . They quicken their pace when suddenly FIFTY VOGON POLICE emerge from the mist .
KWALTZ: Fire upon the kidnapper !
ZAPHOD: Zarquon ! Friendly fire ! Well , if that 's what they want He pulls out his gun up and fires back .
QUESTULAR: Commander ! The President is the kidnapper !
KWALTZ: Cease fire !
ARTHUR: Oh God , I really hate Thursdays .
FORD: Zaphod , what do we do ?
ZAPHOD: Build bridges between the stars ! He holds up two peace signs , a la Nixon .
ARTHUR: What ?
FORD: I think that was his campaign slogan .
TRILLIAN: Alright , follow me .
QUESTULAR: There they are !
TRILLIAN: Back off or I 'll kill him , I swear I will !
KWALTZ: Could that actually kill him ?
ADMIRERS: Mr. President , Mr. President !
FEMALE ADMIRER: I totally voted for you !
ZAPHOD: Thank you !
KWALTZ: Get her !
VOGON POLICE: Resistance is useless !
ARTHUR: Tricia !
FORD: This way !
ARTHUR: NO ! ! TRICIA ! ! !
KWALTZ: Bring her to Vogsphere for processing , Captain . The captain nods . The screen goes black .
QUESTULAR: They 're coming here ! ? But they 've only accomplished half the mission . What about Zaphod ? HE MUST FACE JUSTICE ! !
KWALTZ: My instructions were clear
ARTHUR: We have to go ! Let 's GO !
ZAPHOD: Right !
ARTHUR: What ? No ! Follow those ships !
ZAPHOD: Hey my third arm . I had one , did n't I ?
ARTHUR: We have to go after her !
EDDIE: Boys , please ! Not so rough . You 're damaging my joystick .
FORD: Who is that ?
MARVIN: Ghastly , is n't it ? I was asked to change the personality type , this was the emergency back-up .
EDDIE: How , if you want me to take you somewhere , we 're going to have to start using ou magic words , `` please '' and `` thank you . ''
ARTHUR: Can you change it back ?
MARVIN: I can but I wo n't enjoy it .
EDDIE: I 'm wait-ing
ARTHUR: Ford ?
FORD: Marvin ?
MARVIN: Do n't look at me . I 'm too depressed .
ARTHUR: Computer ? ! Is n't there some kind of manual override switch thing ?
EDDIE: Yeeessss
EDDIE: Magic words ?
ARTHUR: Show me the override switch or I 'll eprogram you with a very large axe .
EDDIE: I can see this relationship is something we 're all going to have to work at .
FORD: I think I should push this button . Ford pushes a big button . AN ALARM SOUNDS !
ARTHUR: What 's that ? What happened ? !
FORD: A sign lit up saying `` Please do not push this button again . ''
MARVIN: I know . Dreadful , is n't it ?
ARTHUR: Sorry about the landing . Where are we ?
ZAPHOD: Magrathea !
FORD: Wrong . This is the Vogon planet . This is Vogsphere .
ZAPHOD: No . It 's Magrathea ! I know it !
FORD: Little something I learned about on an Altairian star cruiser . Captains use them when they really need to concentrate .
ARTHUR: What is it ?
FORD: A Thinking Cap .
MARVIN: This will all end in tears , I just know it . Marvin moves out , a few paces behind .
FORD: I checked the guide for ways to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere . It said `` Do n't . '' I 'm assuming your plan is better .
ARTHUR: Well , I sort of had this idea we could
ZAPHOD: See what ?
ARTHUR: Nothing .
FORD: What was it ?
ARTHUR: Nothing . Just my imagination .
FORD: Okay . I think we A paddle springs up and smacks Ford 's face .
ARTHUR: You , too ?
FORD: Yes . What was that ? Arthur lifts his feet very carefully .
ZAPHOD: I think we should keep going .
ARTHUR: What the blazes is that ?
FORD: I have an idea .
ARTHUR: I ca n't , help it ! Trillian is in there somewhere and we need an idea to save her .
ZAPHOD: I have an idea . Run !
FORD: Ever the politician .
ARTHUR: Okay , so not thinking , not thinking , no ideas coming this is by no means an idea that has any merit , but Marvin can you give me a hand ?
ARTHUR: Alright , where is she ?
VOGON OFFICER: Name ?
TRILLIAN: Trillian . He types into his ancient looking computer .
VOGON OFFICER: Not registered .
TRILLIAN: Try Tricia McMillan .
VOGON OFFICER: Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of Blaard ?
TRILLIAN: No . Tricia Imogene McMillan of Earth .
VOGON OFFICER: Sorry . No record of `` Earth . ''
TRILLIAN: Earth . In the Milky Way ? { remembering ) Umgalactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha .
VOGON OFFICER: Right . Here it is . `` Earth . Destroyed . '' Do you have a second home planet ? PUSH IN ON TRILLIAN gutted by the news .
TRILLIAN: Destroyed ? No that 's impossible .
VOGON OFFICER: Says here it was destroyed to make way fo a hyperspace expressway . The order was giventhree weeks ago .
ZAPHOD: He said the gray building , right ?
ARTHUR: There . That 's it . This way . He raises Marvin 's arm , pointing the fingers .
TRILLIAN: I do n't believe you . This is some sort of trick . Zaphod would n't blow up a planet , especially mine .
KWALTZ: These are the orders .
TRILLIAN: Love and kisses ? She hands the paper back , swallowing emotion .
KWALTZ: Now according to Section 8 , sub-section 34 dash A , the punishment for kidnapping is a recitation of the classic poem , `` Ode to the Removal of Your Left Kidney . '' Unless said kidnapping is of the President , in which case you are to be fed to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal . We thank you for your cooperation .
ARTHUR: Yes . Hi . We 're here about getting a prisoner released ?
ARTHUR: Right . Once I 've filled it out can I eturn to the front of the line , seeing as I 've already waited
ZAPHOD: You want me to make a speech , shake a hand ? That 's what I do I think . It 's all a little fuzzy . Arthur angrily fills out the form .
ARTHUR: Alright , look . This is the President .
VOGON PROCESSOR: Go to the Prisoner Release Lobby , out the door , right , left , 2nd door on the right .
KWALTZ: You 're free to go . Release her .
QUESTULAR: What ! ? He 's here ? ! Zaphod is here ! ? Let 's go get him !
TRILLIAN: You bastard . You signed the order to destroy Earth ? !
ARTHUR: He did ?
ZAPHOD: I did ?
TRILLIAN: `` Love and kisses , Zaphod ? '' I saw the form . You did n't even read it , did you ?
ZAPHOD: Honey , I 'm President of the Galaxy . I do n't get a lot of time for reading .
TRILLIAN: An entire planet , Zaphod . My home . Gone . All because you thought someone wanted your autograph !
ZAPHOD: They framed me ! It 's routine fo controlling Presidents !
KWALTZ: Cancellation of the Rescue of the President .
ARTHUR: Trillian
TRILLIAN: You knew . Why did n't you tell me ?
ARTHUR: I tried . He threatened me .
TRILLIAN: Get a backbone , Arthur . She storms ahead of him . He stops .
ARTHUR: What about coming here to rescue you ? ! That was my brilliant idea ! A paddle shoots up and slaps him in the face .
KWALTZ: The President tests my patience . This time , I shall pursue him myself . Ready my ship !
QUESTULAR: Yes ! This is more like it .
KWALTZ: My license is expired , Mr. Vice President . I ca n't fly with an expired license it 's against the law .
EDDIE: Hi , fellas . Hold on to your hats !
ZAPHOD: Eddie ! Welcome back !
ZAPHOD: IS N'T IT GREAT ? !
EDDIE: Guys , I 'm just super happy to tell you we 're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma
ZAPHOD: Okay , that 's itI think . Computer ? Is thatwhere are we headed again ?
FORD: Magrathea ?
EDDIE: Hang on , fella , and I 'll check .
ARTHUR: Look , you 're right . You deserved to know and I should 've told you . I do n't blame you if you 're angry .
ZAPHOD: Take us in .
MARVIN: It 's rubbish .
GHOSTLY IMAGE: Greetings . This is a recorded announcement as we 're all out the moment . The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for you esteemed visit , but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business . If you would like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted , kindly do so at the tone . BEEP . Then stunned silence .
ARTHUR: Closed ? How can a planet be closed ?
ZAPHOD: For once , Aldus , I agree with you . Okay , computer . Keep going . Take us down .
EDDIE: Happy to !
GHOSTLY IMAGE: It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated . As a token of our appreciation , we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles we 've just sent to converge with you craft . To ensure on-going quality of service , your death may be monitored fo training purposes . Thank you . The image vanishes . A beat . Then
EDDIE: Guys , I 'm delighted to tell you there are two thermonuclear missiles headed right for us . Should I take evasive action ?
FORD: Umyes , computer . Evade !
EDDIE: There seems to be something jamming my guidance systems . Impact minus 45 seconds . Call me Eddie if it 'll help you elax .
ARTHUR: Computer ! DO SOMETHING ! !
EDDIE: Sure thing , fellah . Handing over manual control . Good luck !
ZAPHOD: I ca n't do this without my other arm !
FORD: No . They 're right behind us .
ARTHUR: Look , why do n't I just hit this thing ?
ZAPHOD: NO ! We 're here ! No telling where it will send us !
TRILLIAN: Exactly where we were , I think .
ZAPHOD: And the missiles ?
FORD: Have apparently turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale .
EDDIE: At an improbability factor of eight million , seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand , one hundred and twenty-eight to one against .
ARTHUR: I could really use a cup of tea .
GUIDE VOICE: It is important to note that suddenly , and against all probability , a sperm whale had een called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet . And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale , this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more . This is what it thought as it fell .
GUIDE VOICE: Curiously , the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was `` Oh no , not again . '' We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING .
ARTHUR: You mean the hippies were right ?
ZAPHOD: Okay . In we go .
ARTHUR: What ? ! Are you out of what 's left of you mind ? We ca n't step into thatthat .
FORD: We got ta pick one , right ? If it 's not the ight one , we come back and pick another . No biggie .
ARTHUR: Yes big biggie . What if that 's the last door we ever step through ? What if it rips us into tiny little atomic particlethingies .
ZAPHOD: It 's the right one . I have a hunch .
ARTHUR: Ford.. ?
FORD: He 's got good hunches . I say we go .
ARTHUR: Go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain who 's wearing a ridiculous thinking cap ! ? Are you insane ? !
ZAPHOD: Hey , I think I resent that .
ARTHUR: I do n't care what you think you think
ZAPHOD: That 's supposed to happenI think .
ARTHUR: No . No ! NOOO ! ! !
MARVIN: I told you this would all end in tears .
ARTHUR: Life is full of paradoxes , is n't it ?
MARVIN: Do n't talk to me about life .
ARTHUR: Here I am , God knows how far from home
MARVIN: Do n't talk to me about God .
ARTHUR: and this is where I see the most spectacular sunset I 've ever laid eyes on . We only had the one sun at home . Planet called Earth .
MARVIN: I know . You keep going on about it . It sounds awful .
ARTHUR: Oh no , it 's beautiful . Or at least , it was
MARVIN: Did it have oceans ?
ARTHUR: Yes . Great wide rolling blue oceans .
MARVIN: Ca n't bear oceans . Arthur looks up at Marvin .
ARTHUR: So this is how it will all end , then ? Me , on a dead planet with a manically depressed robot .
MARVIN: You think you 've got problems ? What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot ? No , do n't bother to answer that , I 'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I do n't know the answer . It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level .
ARTHUR: Aah !
SLARTIBARTFAST: My name is not important .
ARTHUR: Late ? What for ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: What is your name , Earthman ?
ARTHUR: Dent . Arthur Dent .
SLARTIBARTFAST: Late as in `` the late Dentarthurdent . '' It 's a sort of threat you see . Never been much good at them myself , but I 'm told they can be terribly effective .
ARTHUR: Trust a man who wo n't tell me his name ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: My name ? Very well My name isSlartibartfast . Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow .
SLARTIBARTFAST CONT'D: I said it was n't important .
MARVIN: I could calculate your chances of survival but you wo n't like it .
SLARTIBARTFAST: I must warn you . We are about to pass through , well , a sort of gateway thing . It may disturb you . It scares the willies out of me .
ARTHUR: Whaa !
MARVIN: Funny how just when you think life ca n't possibly get any worse , it suddenly does .
GHOSTLY IMAGE: This is a recorded announcement as we 're all out at the moment . The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for
KWALTZ: Turn that off .
SLARTIBARTFAST: I told you you might find it a bit disturbing .
ARTHUR: I have found this whole day a bit disturbing .
SLARTIBARTFAST: Did you know we built planets ?
ARTHUR: and men .
SLARTIBARTFAST: Mmmm ? What ?
ARTHUR: The best laid plans of mice and men .
SLARTIBARTFAST: I do n't think men have got much to do with it .
ZAPHOD: This is it !
DEEP THOUGHT: Shhh . This is a good bit .
ZAPHOD: Oh great Deep Thoughtwe have traveled longand far . Have you calculated the Ultimate Question ? Of Life , the Universe and Everything ?
DEEP THOUGHT: No .
ZAPHQD: No ?
DEEP THOUGHT: I 've been watching TV .
ZAPHOD: Oh
DEEP THOUGHT: I designed another computer to perform that great task .
ZAPHOD: Oh , rightI forgot . Is it here ?
DEEP THOUGHT: Not here . Another world .
ZAPHOD: It 's on another world ?
DEEP THOUGHT: It is another world . Or was .
ZAPHOD: Where ?
DEEP THOUGHT: Ask your companion .
ZAPHOD: 0kay you 're sure you do n't have the Question ? Or a way to you , you know access it o something . I think I 've done like a lot to get here
DEEP THOUGHT: Shhhhhh
ZAPHOD: Great . This is just great . Let 's go find something else for my entire life to be about .
FORD: Zaphod . The gun ? The one Humma sent us for ? We have to get it . You gave the guy your head .
ZAPHOD: I know . Why did I do that ?
FORD: UmDeep Thought ? We we 're told you have a g
ZAPHOD: Thank you .
FORD: Hey , man , you must be really frustrated . To go through all you did only to come here and get no answer , which means no fame and money , and you deserve that , man . Because you 're great you 're just eally , really great .
TRILLIAN: Give me that thing .
SLARTIBARTFAST: The galaxy was a bit of a shambles , you see . Everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and really creative and interesting things like that . No one doing the boring jobs .
ARTHUR: Oh , you had that problem , too ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: In spades . So a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs . Tax inspectors , traffic wardens , government officials . We were commissioned to build a special planet for them . Problem was , some cleverdick made it so any time one of the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around the face .
ARTHUR: What ? You did that ? I 've been there !
SLARTIBARTFAST: Then I gather you 've met some of the inhabitants .
ARTHUR: The Vogons ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: Relentless blighters .
ZAPHOD: and you 're right , I should n't be so upset 'cause life goes on and I should just go on with it , right ?
TRILLIAN: Shoot him again . Ford reluctantly pulls the trigger . CLICK .
ZAPHOD: Hitchhiking is good . Towels are good , too .
TRILLIAN: Brilliant .
FORD: Yeah . I kinda like this . She take the gun from him .
TRILLIAN: A gun that makes people suddenly see things from your point of view . Useful tool for the deranged evangelist trying to convert the masses , eh ? She starts walking .
ZAPHOD: Who cares ?
TRILLIAN: I do especially since we 're both somewhat of an endangered species now .
ZAPHOD: Why so edgy ?
TRILLIAN: Wo n't affect me . I 'm already a woman .
ZAPHOD: Uh oh oh . It 's okay , it 's only a couple of
SLARTIBARTFAST: Here we are , then . Look familiar ?
ARTHUR: So it was n't destroyed ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: Actually , it was . This is a back-up . Earth Mark II .
ARTHUR: So you 're saying you made the Earth ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: Well , not me alone . It was a group effort . I did my part , though . Ever heard of a place , I think it 's called Norway ?
ARTHUR: Mice ? Who cares about bloody mice ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: Are you a fan of plate tectonics ?
ARTHUR: They broughtI 'm sorry , when you say `` mice '' do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: These creatures you call `` mice '' are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings . The whole business with the cheese must 've een a front . They were experimenting on you , you see . A vast computer program
ARTHUR: Ah . I see where you 're confused . You see we were experimenting on them .
SLARTIBARTFAST: Oh , I gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod you thinking here and there . But you were actually elements in the computer program . They really are very clever hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings . Ah . They 've nearly finished the oceans .
ARTHUR: So you 're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thoughtand Deep Thought designed the Earthwhich was a giant supercomputerthat you builtto calculate the Ultimate Question . Only , Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: That 's bureaucracy for you .
ARTHUR: Actually , this explains a lot . All my life I 've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world , something big , something sinister
SLARTIBARTFAST: That 's just perfectly normal paranoia . Everyone in the universe has that .
SLARTIBARTFAST: I do n't know , perhaps I 'm old and tired , ut I always think that the chances of finding out what 's really going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy . I 'd much rather be happy than right any day .
ARTHUR: And are you ?
SLARTIBARTFAST: No . That 's where it all falls down of course . Here we are , then .
ARTHUR: Is this ?
FORD: Funniest thing . Our hosts attacked us with Dismodulating Anti Phase Stun Mist then brought us to this amazing meal as a way to make it up to us . Try the mutton . It 's fantastic .
ZAPHOD: Zarking incredible .
ARTHUR: Hosts attack you ? And then you sit down for is that tea ?
BENJY MOUSE: After ten million years on Earth , and a ather large chunk of that time in England , it would be utterly humiliating if we did n't know how to make a decent pot of tea . Arthur stares in shockca n't speak .
TRILLIAN: Arthur , these are our hosts . Benjy mouse and Franky mouse . They control a large sector of the Universe in our dimension . I 'm sorry , I thought you were told about the mice
ARTHUR: Yes . Yes , I was . I just was n't quite prepared for the full reality of it . He steadies himself on the table .
BENJY MOUSE: Sit , Earthman . Eat .
ARTHUR: In a moment , perhaps . I ca n't seem to let go of this table . Slartibartfast steps forward .
SLARTIBARTFAST: Pardon the interruption , but I 'll just be getting back to work now .
BENJY MOUSE: That wo n't be necessary , Slartibartfast .
ZAPHOD: Smarty fart blast ?
BENJY MOUSE: It looks like we wo n't be needing the new Earth after all , now that we 've found the only living native of the planet .
SLARTIBARTFAST: Butthey 've nearly finished the oceans .
FRAHKY MOUSE: That will be all , Slartibartfast .
ARTHUR: I 'm sorry , when you say `` the only living native '' do you mean me ? What about her ?
BENJY MOUSE: We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on the ship . She 's half-native . Her real father was a Blahardid , the hyper- intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet Olbed , who apparently popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with a one Ms. Francis McMillan .
TRILLIAN: Which explains a lot .
ARTHUR: So mostly harmless and me . That 's it .
BENJY MOUSE: We 're sorry to have stage managed you so shamelessly , but once we learned you were the only full-blooded Earthling in the universe , it was important that we get you here by any means necessary .
FRANKY MOUSE: We 've spent a considerable amount of time on your planet trying to find this wretched Ultimate Question , and the thought of doing it all over again on account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me to no end . Which is why you 're here .
BENJY MOUSE: Sit , Earthling . Sit . Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him .
ARTHUR: Mmmm . This really is delicious .
BENJY MOUSE: Good . Glad you like it . Now to usiness .
ZAPHOD: Sorry . Thought you were proposing a toast .
BENJY MOUSE: About this Ultimate Question . You see , we 've been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D TV chat show and lecture circuit , and quite frankly , we 're very much inclined to take it .
FRANKY MOUSE: But - and here 's the point - we have to have product . Which means we still need an ultimate question .
BENJY MOUSE: Or at least , one that sounds ultimate .
FRANKY HOUSE: Yes . Got to sound good .
ARTHUR: An Ultimate Question that sounds good From a couple of micefor a chat show .
FRANKY MOUSE: And as it turns out , the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain . Which is why we need it . More tea ?
ARTHUR: I 'm sorry did you just say you need my ain ?
BENJY MOUSE: Yes . To extract the question .
ARTHUR: You ca n't have my brain . I 'm using it .
FRANKY MOUSE: Barely .
BENJY MOUSE: We can replace it if you think it 's important . An electronic brain maybe .
FRANKY MOUSE: A simple one should suffice . Who would know the difference ?
ARTHUR: I would !
FRANKY MOUSE: No , you would n't . We could program you not to .
ARTHUR: Ford ! Zaphod ! TRILLIAN ! !
BENJY MOUSE: Do n't worry . You wo n't feel a thing .
ARTHUR: Wait a minute , JUST WAIT A SODDING
BENJY MOUSE: Hey , that 's not bad .
ARTHUR: Fine . Take it . There 's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled , with questions , and I can assure you mate , no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness . Confusion ? Yes . Indecision ? Loads . But happiness ? He shakes his head .
BENJY MOUSE: We do n't want to be happy . We want to be ich .
FRANKY MOUSE: Take his brain .
BENJY MOUSE: Shoot him ! !
FRANKY MOUSE: Oh , shit .
ZAPHOD: Ohhhh , I think I 'm gon na be sick .
MARVIN: I must warn you , I 'm feeling very depressed .
KWALTZ: Mr. President ! We are here for you protection !
ZAPHOD: Thank you !
FORD: Okay that thing I said about not saving my life because we 're even ? Scratch that . Save at will .
TRILLIAN: We need that gun .
ZAPHOD: We need tighter gun control !
FORD: We need his other head . Okay I 'll create a distraction . He holds up his towel .
ARTHUR: Brilliant plan . I 'm certain it will work .
FORD: You know I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you 're actually saying .
TRILLIAN: Now !
QUESTULAR: It 's a towel ! It 's only a TOWEL ! ! GET
FORD: Duck !
ZAPHOD: Where ?
QUESTULAR: Shoot me . Please Zaphod . Shoot me .
ZAPHOD: Marvin . You saved our lives .
MARVIN: I know . Wretched , is n't it ?
QUESTULAR: Oh man ! I love being me ! !
ARTHUR: Thank you .
SLARTIBARTFAST: I 've just been informed by some of the lads that since we 're so near completion , we 're going to go ahead and finish Earth . We can put it back exactly the way it was when you left , you know unless there 's anything you 'd like to change . Something you think your planet could do without ?
ARTHUR: Yes . Me .
TRILLIAN: Let 's go somewhere .
ARTHUR: Yes , You name it . I 'll go .
ZAPHOD: I 'm going to Humma 's . He has my headI think . Does n't he ? I 'm so confused .
FORD: And I 'm hungry . After we get your head let 's grab a bite . I know this great estaurant at the end of the universe . As they walk away , we CUT TO
SLARTIBARTFAST: Okay . Hold tight .
SEBASTIAN: Damnit .
LINDA: Sebastian , do you know what time it is ?
SEBASTIAN: Who s that ?
LINDA: Not your business . Not anymore .
SEBASTIAN: Touche .
LINDA: So you calling about anything in particular , or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude ?
SEBASTIAN: I cracked the reversion .
LINDA: You cracked it ?
SEBASTIAN: Look at this .
LINDA: You sure ?
SEBASTIAN: 91 % sure .
LINDA: Eleven months with no progress and you suddenly come up with it out of the lue ? How ?
SEBASTIAN: The usual . Coffee and twinkies .
LINDA: I hate you .
SEBASTIAN: I know . You think you could hunt down Matt and get to the lab early . I want Isabelle prepped for a live test .
LINDA: Yeah , I think I can find him . What are you going to do ?
SEBASTIAN: Well y know . It s daylight in Switzerland . I got ta call the Nobel Committee and tell them to get ou prizes ready . See you in a few .
LINDA: Hey come on .
MATT: What ?
LINDA: Sebastian just called . We got ta get to the lab . Matt bolts up .
MATT: Shit ! You didn t tell him I was here , did you ?
LINDA: Give me some credit , will ya .
MATT: So what s the rush ?
LINDA: He cracked reversion . Matt pulls his jeans on .
MATT: Wan na ride down ?
LINDA: We better take our own cars .
MATT: You re gon na have to tell him about us eventually .
LINDA: I know . It s just You re his best friend . He ll feel betrayed .
MARINE GUARD: Morning , sir .
SEBASTIAN: Morning , Ed .
MARINE GUARD: Your team s in early . Something special going on ?
SEBASTIAN: Sorry , Ed . You know the rules .
MARINE GUARD: Have a good day , sir .
SEBASTIAN: Caine zero zero two seven .
MATT: Isabelle
LINDA: You okay ?
MATT: She bit me .
LINDA: Yeah . She s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days . Linda takes the goggles from Matt . LINDA Go take care of that bite . I ll get her .
MATT: And give you a chance to pull ahead ? Never .
LINDA: Knock it off . Isabelle !
MATT: Good shootin , Tex .
LINDA: What s that make it ?
MATT: I m still ahead . 6 to 5 .
LINDA: But I m catching up .
SARAH: Can I have a word ?
SEBASTIAN: Most normal people say good morning .
SARAH: Don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject Isabelle ?
SEBASTIAN: How many tissue samples have we successfully regressed ? Hundreds , ight ? How many have gone on to work on the full system ? None .
SARAH: That s beside the point .
SEBASTIAN: No , that is the point . I m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure . This thing works . I know it . I feel it .
SARAH: Fine . You can mop up afterward .
SEBASTIAN: You think I m going to kill Isabelle ?
SARAH: Kill ? More like liquefy .
SEBASTIAN: Sarah , thank you for your opinion , but I m the project leader . Understand ? She says
SARAH: Yes , Sir .
SEBASTIAN: How did you ever convince me to hire her ?
LINDA: You said you wanted the beat vet in the country .
SEBASTIAN: Yeah , well she cares more about the animals than the research .
LINDA: Maybe that s why she s so good .
SEBASTIAN: Who da Man ? You da Man .
MATT: As we pull out we see we are .
SEBASTIAN: Vitals ?
SARAH: Normal .
BOOMING VOICE: THIS IS GOD . YOU ARE DISTURBING THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY . GOD HAS SPOKEN . SEBASTIAN How many times do I have to tell you , Frank you aren t God . I am .
SEBASTIAN: You guys ready to roll ?
FRANK: We are live and in color . On you mark .
SEBASTIAN: Okay . Roll em .
JANICE: Okay . We are rolling record on videos one through twelve .
LINDA: Testing De-Phase protocol . Injecting serial protein Caine One Two Five .
MATT: Maybe if you stopped naming them afte yourself , you d have better luck .
SEBASTIAN: Why thank you , Dr. Kensington , fo that keen scientific observation . I ll e sure to include it in my memoirs .
MATT: A whole mention ? And I thought I was just gon na be a footnote .
SEBASTIAN: Ready .
LINDA: Propped .
MATT: Let s make some history .
SEBASTIAN: Nice try , Sparky . Matt relinquishes the needle .
LINDA: Come on , Isabelle . You can do this .
SARAH: Elevated heartbeat .
JANICE: We re still in the green .
FRANK: Confirmed . Vitals still in the normal ange .
MATT: It s reacting .
SEBASTIAN: Do you see this ?
LINDA: It s working . It s actually working .
SARAH: Heart rate s up . She s scared . Sarah soothes her . SARAH It 's okay , baby . It 's okay .
SEBASTIAN: Subject began manifesting almost Immediately . Protocol is reacting quickly .
LINDA: Subject may be in pain or extreme discomfort .
SARAH: Goddamnit . Blood pressure elevating . Brain activity going through the roof .
SEBASTIAN: What ? What problem ! Sarah checks her monitors .
SARAH: It s her heart . We can see the heart eating in the ape s
LINDA: Got the crash cart .
SARAH: We re losing her . Her machine flatlines .
SEBASTIAN: No ! It s got to work .
LINDA: Clear !
SARAH: We ve got something !
LINDA: Come on Isabelle . Come on . You can do it . You can fucking do it . Everybody s pulling for her .
SARAH: Come on , monkey .
MATT: Do it . Do it . Come on .
SARAH: Stabilizing .
LINDA: Welcome back , Isabelle .
SEBASTIAN: How is she ?
SARAH: I think she s gon na be okay
CARTER: Amazing . She 's normal , absolutely healthy . If you did n't know any etter , you 'd think nothing had happened to her .
MATT: Yeah . I ca n't wait to slice up he ain and trace her neural pathways .
SARAH: Screw you , Matt .
MATT: Well maybe not right away .
LINDA: We should celebrate .
SEBASTIAN: To the finest research team I 've eve known .
LINDA: I thought you 'd gone .
SEBASTIAN: Where would I go ?
LINDA: A little `` I am become death the shatterer of worlds '' ?
SEBASTIAN: Something like that .
LINDA: Since the day I met , all you wanted to do was change the world . She puts her hand on his shoulder . LINDA Listen , I know we 've I mean well I just want you to know how proud I am of you . I know it probably does n't mean a lot
SEBASTIAN: Actually it does . I guess since you were there from the eginning , you know me better than anyone else on this godforsaken planet .
LINDA: You 're positively maudlin . You should e happy . Do you have any idea what you 've accomplished ?
SEBASTIAN: Yeah but I was working so hard , I did n't realize I 'd have no one to share it with .
MATT: What was that about ?
LINDA: Nothing . It 's just He is who he is . Sometimes I just have to be reminded .
SEBASTIAN: What 's it like ? Talk goddamnit ! Tell me what it 's like !
KRAMER: But now ?
GENERAL: How long ?
SEBASTIAN: Sir ?
GENERAL: Son , as you can imagine , we are very anxious to field test this tactical asset . How long till you resolve this issue ?
SEBASTIAN: Should n't be more than another year , Sir . Frustrated sighs all around the room . SEBASTIAN Maybe sooner .
MATT: Yo . Reality check ! What the hell was that about ?
SEBASTIAN: Keep your voice down .
MATT: The protocol works . Why 'd you tell them it did n't ?
SEBASTIAN: I was n't ready for them to know .
MATT: But they 're the oversight committee . They 're supposed to know .
LINDA: I 'm sure he had a reason . You did have a reason , did n't you , Sebastian ?
SEBASTIAN: I had more than a reason . I had a goddamn epiphany . They reach his Porsche . SEBASTIAN What do you think they 'd do if they know we could send a subject into phase shift and pull it back out again ? How many seconds would it take for them to take over the whole project , bringing in their soldiers to test the formula on . We 'd have lost control of it by the end of the week .
LINDA: It 's their money , Sebastian . It 's going to happen eventually .
SEBASTIAN: I know . But not yet . There 's too much for us to learn . I do n't want my hands tied by their political agenda when we go to phase three .
MATT: Well , then mind telling us how you 're gon na get a human test-subject for phase three without the committee finding out ?
SEBASTIAN: That 's easy . I 've decided to test the procedure
FRANK: Are you nuts ?
SEBASTIAN: Was Jonas Salk nuts ?
FRANK: Yeah . Pretty sure he was .
CARTER: And remember , for every Jonas Salk , there are a bunch of guys who are n't famous cuz they died .
SEBASTIAN: If we 're that unsure , how can we morally justify testing it on someone else ?
JANICE: Is n't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway ?
SARAH: She 's right . We have n't even finished collating the phase two research .
SEBASTIAN: We 'll have plenty of time to collate and cross-reference later . Monkey data does n't matter anyway . The only real data is human data .
SARAH: You do n't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans .
SEBASTIAN: How are we gon na find out ? Besides , we 've succeeded with a gorilla and their DNA is 98 % the same as humans . And the 2 % is not that significant .
LINDA: Sebastian humans can talk , build houses and cook in microwave ovens . Gorilla 's live in trees . That 's a helluva 2 % if you ask me .
SEBASTIAN: We 're all concerned . I know that . But if we 're gon na move forward ever , this is something we have to do .
LINDA: Why you ? Why not one of us ?
SEBASTIAN: The risks . I could n't ask
MATT: What if we volunteer ?
LINDA: What if you 're too valuable to lose ?
SEBASTIAN: I 'm Project Leader . It 's my formula and my call . The best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work . I 'll want about four weeks to
FRANK: To put your affairs in order ?
SEBASTIAN: To run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we 'll attempt the phase shift . I 'll stay shifted for three days of testing and then we 'll perform a quantum regression .
LINDA: In the past six years , I 've never once challenged your decisions , but this Sebastian . I do n't think you should do this .
SEBASTIAN: You do n't understand .
LINDA: Oh please . How long were we together ? You must 've said it a million times Nobody knows who built the luna lander . All they remember in the first man on the moon . Sebastian shrugs and nods . LINDA But what if something happens to you what about the project ? Sebastian smiles .
SEBASTIAN: Lin , trust me nothing 's going to happen .
LINDA: He refuses to listen to reason .
MATT: Can we talk about this later ? I 'm trying to make love to you .
LINDA: Sorry . I just ca n't let it go . Matt props himself up on the pillow .
MATT: I know how you 're feeling . Hell , he and I 've been friends since freshman year .
LINDA: So how can we let him do this ?
MATT: What if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on , Mars , would you go ?
LINDA: In a heartbeat .
MATT: What if they did n't know whether o not they could get you home ? Linda thinks about it . It 's still tempting . MATT This is his chance to be Chuck Yeage or Christopher Columbus . Well , if I were him I 'd do the same thing . Matt goes back to kissing Linda .
LINDA: Let me ask another question .
MATT: Is about who gets to be on top ?
LINDA: Is the human race really ready fo what we 're doing ? Matt groans and rolls over .
MATT: Why do you always get philosophical efore we 're about to get physical ?
LINDA: No really . Is it ready ? We 're arrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that I do n't think we can answer .
MATT: They said the same thing about the omb . They said we 'd never survive the nuclear age but here we are .
LINDA: This night is still young . I mean , when you think about it , it 's creepy . Do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappea in the blink of an eye ?
MATT: We made our deal with the devil years ago . Might as well stick around to cash in .
SEBASTIAN: Yes ? Matt sticks his head in .
MATT: We 're ready .
SEBASTIAN: Okay .
MATT: It 's not too late to back out . I 'm happy to take your place .
SEBASTIAN: No . I 'm ready . Matt leads him into the hallway .
MATT: Nervous ?
SEBASTIAN: A little .
MATT: Ever tell you the one about Superman and Wonder Woman ?
SEBASTIAN: I do n't think so .
MATT: So Superman 's flying around the city , and he 's horny as hell . Lo and behold he looks down and sees Wonder Woman , completely nude , sunning herself up on the roof of the Justice League . I mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle . So Superman starts thinking , `` man this is too easy . I could go down there , do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me . '' After all he is faster than a speeding ullet , right ? Anyway , he swoops down , takes care of business so quick , you ca n't even see him . Well I tell ya . Wonder Woman looks up , surprised as hell and says `` What the hell was that . '' And the Invisible Man replies `` I dunno know , but it sure hurt like hell . ''
SEBASTIAN: You know , that could be the last joke I ever hear .
MATT: C'mon , man . That 's funny shit .
LINDA: O.K . How 're you feeling ?
SEBASTIAN: Fine . Sarah checks his vitals .
SARAH: Pulse 88 , BP 140 over 95 . A bit elevated .
SEBASTIAN: To be expected .
SARAH: No reason for concern . He 's ready .
SEBASTIAN: Hey it 's gon na be okay . Linda nods . Back to business .
LINDA: Start recording .
JANICE: We 're hot . All systems nominal , Houston .
FRANK: Okay , kids . Let 's make some history .
LINDA: Subject Male , Age 29 , weight 166 lbs .
MATT: Ready . Linda takes the hypo from Matt . MATT If the tests are any indication it should work quickly .
SEBASTIAN: I 'll inject myself . If anything goes wrong , they ca n't blame you .
LINDA: We can still shut down , Sebastian . He shakes his head .
MATT: Any last words ?
SEBASTIAN: Yeah . If I 'm killed , pretend I said something deep and clever .
LINDA: Injection was administered at
SEBASTIAN: Nothing so far .
SARAH: Vitals are stable . They wait and watch .
LINDA: Nothing 's happening . Another moment passes by .
MATT: Human DNA structure is slightly more complex it 's possible that it may take more time Another moment passes .
LINDA: Maybe we overlooked something .
SEBASTIAN: Recheck the protocol . It ca n't be non- eactive .
CARTER: Kinda like a firecracker with a bad fuse Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look . CARTER Do n't know if it 'll go off .
LINDA: Frank ?
SEBASTIAN: Goddammit . Another long pause . Sebastian concentrates . SEBASTIAN Okay wait , my arm it 's getting a it warm yeah , it 's it 's starting to tingle Excitement overtakes the room . SEBASTIAN Okay it 's spreading to my back like , like a fever
LINDA: Here we go .
SEBASTIAN: Shit it 's starting to burn Oh god . It hurts . I did n't think it would hurt . The HEART BEAT thumps faster , accelerating
SARAH: Heartbeat 's elevated . Pulse at 100 .
LINDA: What do you feel ? Keep talking . KEEP
SEBASTIAN: Pain !
SARAH: Pulse is 165 170 Blood pressure 180 over 100 .
CARTER: He 's going to blow out his heart .
LINDA: Prop the crash cart .
MATT: We 've got to stop it !
LINDA: We ca n't !
JANICE: Something 's happening . Frank leans into the microphone .
FRANK: Listen up ! Electric activity increasing in all limbs . Brainwaves are through the roof .
JANICE: I did n't think the human brain could spike that high .
FRANK: Maybe it ca n't .
SEBASTIAN: No . Oh god ! NO ! STOP IT ! STOP IT !
SARAH: Pulse is 180 . holding stable .
CARTER: Holy shit .
SARAH: Pulse is dropping . 170..
LINDA: Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
MATT: Is he dead ? Linda checks the readouts .
LINDA: No . He passed out from the trauma .
SARAH: Vitals returning to normal . Pulse 110 dropping . Blood pressure 130 ove
MATT: Un-fucking-believable .
LINDA: You did it , Sebastian . You 're the first .
CARTER: Let 's get him into recovery .
MATT: S'okay . You nodded off .
LINDA: His breathing 's hypnotic . How long 's it been ?
MATT: Seventeen hours .
LINDA: Where are the others ?
MATT: In the lab crunching numbers . We 've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research .
LINDA: I keep looking at that hole , wondering if he 's really there .
MATT: He may be coming out of it .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: The lights ! Turn off the goddamn lights ! Ah Christ !
LINDA: Your eyelids are transparent . The sheets slowly stop thrashing .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: So I I 'm
LINDA: Yes .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: My arms . I can.. where ? I can feel them
LINDA: Your arms your whole body It worked , Sebastian . It worked .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Mirror . I I want to see .
MATT: Over here in the corner .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: I It 's hard to think .
MATT: It was painful ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: At first but then everything went lack . I could n't see or hear or feel anything . It was all just black like I was n't connected .
LINDA: Your system received quite a shock .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: At least my senses are starting to eturn You 're wearing you Shalimar , are n't you ?
LINDA: Sebastian . Linda 's hair drops back to her shoulders .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: This is weird . I 'm looking through myself at the floor . I 'm looking right through myself . I ca n't tell He bumps into a chair . SEBASTIAN 'S VOICE where my body is . A moment of silence .
LINDA: Sebastian ?
MATT: Sebastian ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: You really ca n't see me . Can you ?
LINDA: Gim me symptoms . Dizziness , nausea , headache , body-ache , disorientation .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: No , just tired . It 's funny . I can see everything more than before but I ca n't see myself .
CARTER: Hey . How 's he doing ?
LINDA: Why do n't you ask him ?
SARAH: Sebastian , how do you feel .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Not to bad , considering .
LINDA: He ca n't close his eyes so they 're sensitive to light . Linda 's explanation puts everyone at ease .
JANICE: So , what was it like ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Over here .
LINDA: C'mon Sebastian . Knock it off .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Sorry . Could n't resist .
FRANK: I feel like we 're playing Marco Polo .
MATT: Well , I see the procedure has n't changed your personality . Frank pulls on a pair of THERMAL GOGGLES .
FRANK: No worries . I 'm on it .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Boy , you people have no sense of humor .
JANICE: Index Mark . 112125 .
LINDA: It 's late . Time you got some rest .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Just a little longer .
LINDA: Hate to pull rank , but you 're my patient now and you need rest . We 've got a busy day tomorrow . Heavy sigh .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Fine .
LINDA: We 've set up a thermal camera fo observation and I 've arranged one of us to be here 24/7 in case you need anything . The team 's gon na be on alpha- call alert for the duration . If anything goes wrong , we can all be here within
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Thirty minutes . Yes , ,_I know . I wrote the procedure .
LINDA: I was trying to be reassuring .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: You like this do n't you ?
LINDA: What 's that ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Being in charge .
LINDA: Please . I 'm just doing my job .
SARAH: Fine . It 's not like I have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life .
LINDA: Carter 'll be in at six to spell you and I 'll be in by nine . Call me if anything happens , okay ?
SARAH: I 'm fine . Go on ahead .
CARTER: Man , I 'm tired . That was a long day .
LINDA: Days only get longer from here .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Sarah . Are you awake ? Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastian 's . SEBASTIAN 'S VOICE Hmm .
SARAH: Dr. Caine ! Goddamnit , Dr. Caine ! Are you in here ?
LINDA: Why did n't you call me ?
SARAH: Because I was n't sure . I 'm still not . I mean , I could 've easily been dreaming .
MATT: It does n't sound like something Sebastian would do .
SARAH: God , I feel so stupid .
LINDA: I can talk to him .
SARAH: No . I mean It was probably nothing . I shouldn't 've mentioned it .
MATT: You sure ?
SARAH: Yeah , I 'm sure . I mean , y'know , why would he do that , right ? Just , this place at night can be kinda creepy , y'know .
MATT: So , how was your first night ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Restless . Hard to sleep when you ca n't close your eyes .
MATT: Yeah ? What 'd you do ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Got up a couple of times . Knocked about .
MATT: Yeah , Sarah mentioned you were n't in your cubicle . She said she called you over the intercom and you did n't espond .
SEBASTIAN: I guess I did n't hear . I had the radio on .
MATT: It 'd be helpful to us if you 'd tell whoever 's on duty where you 're going to . I mean , if something were to happen , we 'd want to know where to find you .
SEBASTIAN: I did n't think it was a problem .
MATT: It is n't . I just do n't want it to ecome one .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Next I want to run a VV and UVF analysis of the platelets .
MATT: We 'll have to draw some more blood .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: You okay ?
SARAH: Yeah . Why ?
SEBASTIAN: You just seem a little nervous .
SARAH: No . II 'm fine . Hold still . This might hurt a bit .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: No . I was looking at the clock . Why ?
SARAH: Just felt like someone was staring at me .
LINDA: Sebastian ? Goddamnit .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: You 've no idea how much fun I 've had . I 'm going to hate going back .
LINDA: That 's what worries me . ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: How so ?
LINDA: What happens when we turn the project over to the Army . Ever wonder how much fun they 're gon na have ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Maybe we wo n't give it to them . His voice comes from behind her now .
LINDA: Stop it , Sebastian . It 's not funny .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Well , do n't do it for me . Do it fo science . Linda walks away . Sebastian laughs .
LINDA: Grow up .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Oh well . Missed your big chance .
LINDA: Got some sleep . Big day tomorrow .
FRANK: Recording . Subject Doctor Sebastian Caine . Currently in phase shift Three days , seven hours .
LINDA: De-Phase protocol . Injecting Serial Protein Caine One Two Seven .
SEBASTIAN: Not really . I was just starting to enjoy myself .
LINDA: Tough .
MATT: Okay , man . Here we go .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Wait something something does n't feel right .
SARAH: Heartbeat elevated .
FRANK: Vitals still nominal..
SEBASTIAN: I ca n't br br Sebastian begins wheezing .
LINDA: What 's wrong ?
SARAH: He 's not breathing .
MATT: Subject manifesting .
SARAH: Pulse erratic .
LINDA: Carter !
MATT: Get a tranq . Stat .
LINDA: He 's reverting . Got him on the table .
SARAH: I got no pulse . No pulse .
MATT: Start CPR .
CARTER: Getting a pulse .
MATT: Holy shit . What happened ?
LINDA: Sebastian can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? How are his pupils ?
MATT: I ca n't see his goddamn pupils !
SARAH: I think he 's going into shock .
FADE: UP ON
MATT: Just got the tissue sample results . Cellular cohesion is stable .
LINDA: Guess so . I was just thinking about the Apollo missions . Y'know ? Grissom , White and Chaffee What it was like for them on that launch pad that day , thinking they were gon na reach the stars only to burn to death .
MATT: Sometimes the test pilots make history . Sometimes the planes crash and people die .
LINDA: But he did n't die , did he ? What if we ca n't bring him back ? What then ?
MATT: It 's just a little hitch is all . He 'll e the first to tell that he 'll crack it and I 'm sure he will . It 'll just take time . Listen , let 's got out of here . We could drive up to the old observatory . We 'll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile . She pulls away .
LINDA: No . I want to be here for him .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Hey
LINDA: Hey
SEBASTIAN: So I guess it did n't work . Linda shakes her head .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: You look worried . It must 've been bad . Sebastian 's voice is weak and strained .
LINDA: You almost died .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Well , remember your Nietchze . Whateve does n't kill me , makes me stronger . Linda smiles .
LINDA: I should be making you feel better . Not vice versa .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: I guess if I 'm going to be stuck this way for awhile , I 'd better make some adjustments .
MATT: Not too bad .
SEBASTIAN: The latex 'll limit the amount of light delivered to my optic nerves .
LINDA: You could almost pass for human .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Well , it gives you a face to talk to at least , and we can all work in normal light again .
SEBASTIAN: The testing 's making me sick .
LINDA: Could be the barium or the radiation .
MATT: You 're physiology has changed and , well , all bets are off .
SEBASTIAN: I ca n't believe I have to spend another night here . Suppose you 're gon na go home now , meet up with that boyfriend of yours now .
LINDA: Do you want me to stay ?
SEBASTIAN: No . That 's okay . It 's just , being a guinea pig is more work than I thought . I 'll be fine .
CARTER: Dr. Caine . What 's up ?
SEBASTIAN: Just stopped by to let you know , I 'm going out for a bit . Sebastian turns back into the hallway .
CARTER: Going out ? Hey wait a sec ! Carter scrambles to his feet .
SEBASTIAN: If I do n't get out of here , I 'm gon na go crazy .
CARTER: But you 're not supposed to leave the compound .
SEBASTIAN: Why not ?
CARTER: That 's the rule .
SEBASTIAN: Yes , but I made that rule . It 's my ule and I 'm changing it .
CARTER: You ca n't just change it .
SEBASTIAN: Carter , I was suppose to be like this for three days . Three fucking days and I 'll be damned if I 'm going to spend the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump . Now I 'm going out . I 'll be back in a couple of hours . Okay ?
CARTER: Shit . Carter runs down the corridor .
MARINE GUARD: Hey , Doc . Have n't seen you for awhile ?
SEBASTIAN: Yeah , well . You know how it in sometimes .
MARINE GUARD: You got that right , sir . I was eginning to worry 'cause your ca had n't moved .
SEBASTIAN: Thanks , but everything 's cool .
MATT: He could be anywhere . Hell he could be ight behind us .
LINDA: I 'll meet you at the lab . I 'm gon na swing by his place , just in case .
MATT: See you there .
LINDA: I do n't want him to see .
MATT: What a mess . They get in their cars .
SEBASTIAN: Shit .
LINDA: Sebastian ?
LINDA: Oh shit .
JANICE: What are the tranqs for ?
LINDA: Use your imagination .
JANICE: Are you saying he 's dangerous ?
MATT: We 're just saying we need to be cautious .
LINDA: The Metro stops running after midnight and he 's on foot , so he ca n't have gotten too far .
CARTER: Look , this is n't a monkey we 're talking about . It 's Dr. Caine . Do n't you think you 're over reacting ?
LINDA: This program is classified . If he 's out there it means someone might find out about him . He could destroy the whole program .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Relax , Linda . No one 's gon na find out .
MATT: Where the hell have you been ?
SEBASTIAN: I got a little stir crazy , so I went to my apartment to pick up some stuff .
LINDA: Bullshit ! I went to your apartment and I happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up .
SEBASTIAN: What are you talking about ?
LINDA: You , of all people How could you ?
SEBASTIAN: Just what did you see in my apartment ?
LINDA: I saw your face and your clothes .
MATT: It was bad enough you left without an escort , but to take off the out in public ? Sebastian realizes that they do n't know .
SEBASTIAN: Do n't make a mountain out of molehill . I did n't let anyone see me .
LINDA: That 's not good enough . When you 're outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control . It 's just not safe for you to be out there .
SEBASTIAN: Come on , Linda . You do n't expect me to e some kind of prisoner .
LINDA: You volunteered for this , Sebastian . You knew going in there could be consequences . For the security of this project , I 'm gon na have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm still Project Leader , Linda . It 's my decision to make .
LINDA: You 're right . It 's your decision . But if you leave the compound again , I 'll notify the oversight committee . Then they can make the decision . You understand ?
SEBASTIAN: Matt ?
MATT: Sorry , man . You 'd do the same if it were the other way around .
LINDA: Pack 'em up Everyone go home .
SEBASTIAN: How much blood do you think you 've taken so far ?
LINDA: Not enough to worry about .
SEBASTIAN: Every day feels like you 're sucking me dry .
LINDA: What are you talking about ?
SEBASTIAN: The shoe being on the other foot . You getting to run things .
LINDA: I did n't ask for this , Caine . But when a classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night , someone 's got ta run the show . Look , I know how hard this has been for you .
SEBASTIAN: Do n't patronize me . And for the record , you 've got no idea what it 's like . I get up every morning and you people stick needles in me . You bombard me with radiation until I vomit . And then at six it 's over fo you . You get to go home . But Sebastian is still here . Sebastian ca n't leave , or else . That 's the worst part , you know . Here I have this this GIFT and I ca n't even use it .
LINDA: Now it 's a gift ?
SEBASTIAN: You 're goddamn right it 's a gift . And if you were n't so goddamned short sighted , I 'd be out there right now trying to master it .
LINDA: Where 're you going ?
SEBASTIAN: Looks like I 'm going nowhere .
MATT: Come on , man . We 've got a ton of tests scheduled today .
SEBASTIAN: Do them yourself .
LINDA: Want to talk about it ?
SEBASTIAN: No . Linda looks over his shoulder .
LINDA: `` We are the hollow men , the stuffed men , headpieces filled with straw . ''
SEBASTIAN: Funny , huh ? I 've become a literal metaphor . He puts the books down .
LINDA: I do n't want to fight you . I just want what 's best for the program .
SEBASTIAN: I know . And you being right does n't make it any easier for me .
LINDA: You can be scared . That 's okay .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm not scared of being stuck this way . With a little more make-up and practice , I could pass . Y'know , get by in the world . But the testing
LINDA: You 're talking like you 've given up . It 's only been a few months .
SEBASTIAN: What if it 's years ? I do n't know how much more testing I can take .
MATT: 60 % reversion . 70 % 75 % 80 %
SEBASTIAN: We 've got it . We 've got it .
MATT: 93 % 95 % 95 %
LINDA: That 's all we need .
SEBASTIAN: Come on , baby . Come on .
MATT: Full quantum cascade at 95 % . I 'm sorry .
SEBASTIAN: You 're sorry ? You 're fucking sorry ?
JANICE: I do n't blame him .
LINDA: I 'll go talk to him .
MATT: Leave him alone . He just needs to blow off some steam .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm going to the lab .
FRANK: Okay . I 'm here if you need me .
MATT: How 'd it go ?
FRANK: Quiet . He worked in the lab till about 10 30 and then went to sleep .
SEBASTIAN: Ah , my two favorite people . Good morning .
LINDA: Good morning .
MATT: Why so cheery this morning ?
SEBASTIAN: You know some days you just wake up feeling the world is full of potential . Like your eyes have been opened .
MATT: I 'm happy if I make it to my coffee machine . Linda hands Sebastian a disk .
LINDA: I restructured the third genome on your radiated protein strand . Thought you might want to take look .
SEBASTIAN: Cook up a batch and let 's see where we go .
LINDA: I thought you 'd want to take a look at it .
SEBASTIAN: I trust you . Now if you 'll excuse me , I need to have my head examined .
LINDA: I 'm telling you , I know him . Something 's going on .
MATT: Think he knows about us .
LINDA: If he knew about us , he 'd be angry and that was n't angry .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: When you were a kid , you ever dream about being invisible ?
CARTER: Sure all the time .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: What did you imagine you 'd do ?
CARTER: The usual .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: What 's the usual ?
CARTER: Hanging out in the girl 's locker room . Kicking Jimmy Margiani 's ass .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Jimmy Margiani ?
CARTER: School asshole . Drove a red Trans Am . Back then , I was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Ever think up anything along the grand scale ?
CARTER: Sure . World domination . Manipulating stock markets , consolidating a political power base . But those are more recent fantasies .
SEBASTIAN: And what if it were n't fantasy ? What if you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences whatsoever . How far would go ? I mean if it were real ?
CARTER: I do n't know , man . Out in the real world I mean , there 's a esponsibility
SEBASTIAN: Let 's say you saw a woman with amazing tits . Would you brush against them ?
CARTER: Hell , I try and do that now .
SEBASTIAN: Human nature . So if you could get away with more , would you do more ?
CARTER: I read that in a survey at a majo university they asked college students `` Would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it ? '' 82 % said yes .
SEBASTIAN: Eighty two percent ? Makes you wonde if the world 's ready for what we 're doing .
CARTER: So , Doc what did you do ?
SEBASTIAN: What do you mean ?
CARTER: When you were out .
SEBASTIAN: I just walked around . Y'know .
CARTER: Aw , you just walked around ? Come on . There 's more , right ?
SEBASTIAN: Like what ?
CARTER: Man , I 'd be walking up to people saying shit like `` This is God , go , get a haircut . '' Or hanging out in the changing room at Victoria 's Secret .
SEBASTIAN: Kind of sophomoric , do n't you think . Besides , it was late and I was n't out that long .
CARTER: Well , did you see anybody ?
SEBASTIAN: There was this one girl .
CARTER: Yeah ? And did you mess with her ?
SEBASTIAN: Naw Sebastian gives Carter a sly grin . SEBASTIAN Well maybe a little . I tell you though , a man could get used to it .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Goodnight . Linda-jumps . SEBASTIAN 'S VOICE Sorry , did n't mean to frighten you .
LINDA: It 's fine . I just did n't know you were there . Goodnight .
MATT: I do n't know . I do n't see anything .
CARTER: Hello ?
LINDA: Thanks . No , just checking . 'Kay , bye . Phew . Matt pulls her into him .
MATT: Relax it 's nothing . Where were we ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Be quiet !
SARAH: You awake ?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: I am now . The sheets raise and drape off of him .
SARAH: Notice anything unusual last night .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: No . Why ?
SARAH: Franklin Three . He 's dead .
SEBASTIAN: What of ?
SARAH: His neck was broken and his windpipe collapsed .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: How 'd that happen ?
SARAH: I thought maybe you could tell me .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Sarah You saying I had something to do with it ?
SARAH: He was alive last night when I left and he was dead this morning . And you were the only one down here .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: I was in my room all night .
CARTER: That 's all twelve hours .
LINDA: He never left the room .
SARAH: A windpipe does n't just suddenly collapse . Someone or something killed it .
MATT: You saw the tape . The man was in his chamber .
SARAH: Then we have a problem , because I the cage was locked from the outside . That means it was opened , the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again . Only a human could do that .
CARTER: Well , it was n't me .
MATT: And it was n't him .
LINDA: Are we sure ?
SEBASTIAN: Any big plans for tonight ?
LINDA: Quiet night at home . Maybe a book .
SEBASTIAN: Really ? Whatever happened to that guy your were seeing ?
LINDA: He 's still in the picture . Why ?
SEBASTIAN: Being locked down here , I 'm forced to live vicariously . Someday you 'll have to tell me what he 's like .
LINDA: Maybe someday I will . See you in the morning .
SEBASTIAN: Au domain .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: Hmmm .
LINDA: Forgot something .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: What the hell ?
FRANK: Pretty clever really . All it does is ecycle the signal . He flips this switch , it takes a snapshot and that 's all we see .
LINDA: Asshole .
JANICE: And you think he 's violent ?
SARAH: He killed a dog with his bare hands .
FRANK: Dogs are n't people . Are we in any danger ? Linda does n't know .
LINDA: Either way , we are n't equipped to handle this . We have to inform the committee . Everybody murmurs in agreement .
JANICE: What if he does n't come back ?
LINDA: They 'll go after him . Who has tonight 's shift ?
JANICE: I do .
LINDA: Pretend nothing 's wrong . Everyone just do what you 're doing so he does n't ecome suspicious . Okay ? Matt and I 'll go tell Doctor Kramer and we 'll lot the committee deal with it .
KRAMER: I 'll call General Caster right now and convene the oversight committee tomorrow .
LINDA: Thank you , sir .
MATT: What do we do in the meantime ?
KRAMER: Just sit tight and wait for my call .
MRS. KRAMER: What was that about ?
KRAMER: Just a little trouble at work .
MRS. KRAMER: You coming up ?
KRAMER: In a minute . I have to make a few calls .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: What ? No good morning for me ? Do n't you like me anymore ?
LINDA: Oh , sorry . II 'm in a hurry .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: That 's okay . It 's going to be busy day .
LINDA: When did he say held call ?
MATT: He 's probably meeting with the committee trying to figure out what to do .
LINDA: I 'm gon na call him . Linda picks up the phone and dials . LINDA Yes , Dr. Kramer please . Excuse me ? When ? I 'm so sorry . Linda blanches as she hangs up the phone .
MATT: What ?
LINDA: He 's dead . Drowned in his pool last night . Linda picks up the phone again and dials . LINDA Yes , General Thompson please . Thank you . As she waits the phone line clicks dead . LINDA Hello ? Hello ? She clicks on the hookswitch .
MATT: Let me see that . He tries it too . Same result . MATT Intercom 's working , but there does n't seem to be an outside line .
LINDA: I 'll be right back with help . Linda taps in his floor code .
MATT: Let me try mine . Matt hits buttons on the keypad .
LINDA: Tell me this is n't happening .
MATT: How long before anybody starts looking for us ?
LINDA: There 's no set check in procedure . It could be weeks .
FRANK: Already in . It was only a second level encryption . The Security System specifications pops up .
JANICE: Some security system .
FRANK: Oh the system is fine . It 's just I 'm just extraordinary .
MATT: What is it ?
FRANK: There 's nothing wrong with the system . Our codes have been removed .
MATT: Removed ? By who ?
FRANK: Here 's a clue . Only one code remains .
LINDA: Whose ?
FRANK: Dr. Sebastian Caine .
CARTER: He 's not in there .
LINDA: Okay , Sebastian . Fun 's over . Tell us where you are . She waits . Then
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: I 'm sorry . But I ca n't lot you turn me in .
LINDA: Sebastian where are you ?
JANICE: Dr. Caine ? Are you in here ? Dr. Caine ? Suddenly , Janice jerks back .
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: I 'm here .
FRANK: Doctor Caine ?
LINDA: Sebastian ?
MATT: This is bad .
LINDA: There 's something over there .
MATT: What happened ? Linda lowers the body to the floor .
LINDA: She was strangled . Multiple blows to her head .
MATT: Intercom the phone lines . They 're dead .
LINDA: Gim me that .
MATT: What the fuck is going on here ?
LINDA: Shhh .
FRANK: Did you find him ?
LINDA: Janice is dead .
SARAH: The man has checked out of reality .
FRANK: What happened ? I do n't understand .
CARTER: Is n't it obvious ? Right now , we 're the only ones who knows he exists . If he gets rid of us , no one knows and he ecomes the most powerful man on earth .
FRANK: But he 's not a killer . They all look at Linda .
LINDA: He was n't . He is now .
MATT: Can you fix the elevator ? Restore ou codes ?
FRANK: It 'd take hours to crack the encryptions .
MATT: Right now that sounds like good news .
CARTER: So what do we do until then . Sit around waiting for him to kill us off ?
LINDA: No . We find him , before he finds us .
CARTER: You sure this 'll work .
LINDA: We designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping in year one . They were too small for thermal scans . A map of the compound appears on the screen .
MATT: Systems hot . Activating motion detectors .
LINDA: I 've got movement in Corridor Six .
MATT: That 's him .
LINDA: Check . Check . Her voice echoes from the other unit . LINDA Be careful .
MATT: Just watch our backs . Hey Carter , eady ?
CARTER: Let 's do it .
LINDA: Take a right at the next accessway . He 's working his way back to the offices .
MATT: If we split up , can we trap him on corridor eight ?
LINDA: I lost him . Matt , I lost him .
MATT: He probably just stopped moving .
CARTER: It 's me . Matt pulls off his goggles .
MATT: Do you have anything ?
CARTER: Nothing .
MATT: How did he get by us ?
CARTER: He could n't .
MATT: Sebastian ! We 're here to help . Sebastian .
CARTER: There . Behind those pipes . He 's not moving .
MATT: We see him . But he 's not responding . The heat signature does n't move .
CARTER: Covered .

And when I did , I realized I could have it all . I can kill in broad daylight . And nobody 's gon na tell the police they were fucked by a ghost . Anything I desire I can make happen , but not if people know .

TY: Back slavery days , they had the ones that worked in the big house . Might not of had shoes always , but their pants did n't have no holes and they did n't pick no cotton .
MACEO: House niggers .
TY: That 's how they called em . They must of had all their African kinda instruments- drums , shakers , some kind of banjo thing- but the piano-
MACEO: Did n't bring no piano over on them ships from Africa .
TY: The piano was just sittin there in the white folks ' big room , all polished up and I figure this one boy , he goes past fifteen , twenty times a day , running the corner of his eye over it . And he 's there when they play , the masters , doin all their minuets and whatever- Ty PLAYS something like a MINUET-
MACEO: Down to the bones
TY: And one day the masters is away , huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to , and he 's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench-
MACEO: Watch out now-
TY: -and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do- and he- Ty hits a MINOR CHORD , lets it decay-
MACEO: Would have liked to been there . I mean to hear the cat play , not none of the rest of it .

CHINA DOLL: Sonny that was here yesterday morning .
TY: Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him . Maceo , make a noise on that-
MACEO: It 's electric-

MACEO: Naw , man , it do n't work unless it 's hooked up to the juice , see ? You got the juice , you do n't need the hollow inside the box , the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out-
CHINA DOLL: Sonny said he fix radios in the Army .
TY: Sonny did n't do nothin but feed edbugs in anybody 's Army , and some of em crawled in his head . Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton . Judge Gatlin ought himself a droolin idiot . What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway ?

CHINA DOLL: But he does n't belong there ! Maceo turns the guitar over in his hands-
MACEO: You know , Guitar Sam plays him an electric , but I do n't think it 's this no-hole kind of deal .
TY: I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night , lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass !
MACEO: He come out lookin good , from what I hear . All kind of spangly pants and jacket , got his name spelled out on the back-
TY: Clothes , right-

HARKEN: And ?
NICK: And in my opinion , an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield . Harken nods . Is he impressed ?
HARKEN: Thank you , Nick . Did everyone see how he did that ? Yes , he may be a pathological liar and have a crippling drinking problem , but when the chips are down , Nick has what it takes . Nick glows .

And as soon as I squeeze all the profit out of this place , that 's exactly what I 'm gon na do . So here 's the deal . You either fire the fatty or the cripple , or I fire both of them .

DALE: I heard you moved to New York to work at Lehman Brothers o something .
KURT: So what are you doing back here ?
KENNY: Do n't you read the papers ? They shut us down . I 've been looking for work for the last two years . It 's crazy out here . I ca n't even get a job waiting tables .
NICK: You ? Waiting tables ? You were voted Most Likely to Succeed . Everyone thought you were set .
KENNY: Everyone including me .
CONTINUED: 32 .
DALE: Easy , Kenny .
KENNY: It 's just not fair . I was making high six-figures . Now I ca n't even afford this drink . Seriously , you think you guys can help me out at all ?
DALE: Uh , sure . Here 's a few bucks , Kenny .
KENNY: Okay , y'know that 's not really gon na do it for me . ( looking around ,
LEANING IN: I 'll tell you what ? What if I give you guys handjobs ? Forty ucks . We can do it in the athroom right here . I 'll do the three of you for a hundred .
KURT: You 're gay now ?
KENNY: No , I 'm not gay . They look skeptical .
BARTENDER: I thought I told you to stay out of here !
CONTINUED: 33 .
KENNY: Whoops . Got ta go , guys . Call me if you change your minds . I 'm at my mom 's .
KURT: So I guess we 're just gon na be miserable for the rest of ou lives .
DALE: What do you mean ?
KURT: What options do we have ? We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny . Or keep our jobs and turn into sad , ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses . There 's a beat as Nick regards Kurt .
NICK: You do that too ?
KURT: Of course . Everyone does . It 's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit .
NICK: The other day I imagined shoving one of those jugs from the wate cooler in Harken 's mouth and making him drink until his bladde explodes .
DALE: Jeez .
KURT: That 's so funny . I had the same idea for Pellit .
MORE: 34 . 37 CONTINUED 37 KURT Only using gasoline instead of water . And his ass instead of his mouth .
DALE: You guys are sick .
KURT: What 's sick about it ? It 's just a way to let off steam .
NICK: Yeah , Dale . It 's not like we 're actually going to kill our bosses . They continue walking . After a beat .
KURT: You have to admit though , ou lives would be a lot better if ou osses were dead .
NICK: Well , of course . It 's the one thing that keeps me from being happy .
DALE: Me too . There 's another beat .
KURT: Let 's just consider this , for one second .
DALE: Consider what ?
KURT: Killing our bosses . I 'm just eing hypothetical here .
DALE: Yeah , right .
NICK: Very funny .
KURT: Well , it 's not like they 're gon na live forever . These pieces of shit are going to die someday .
MORE: 35 .
NICK: Shut up , Kurt .
DALE: Yeah , shut up , Kurt .
KURT: Frankly , I do n't see any reason not to do it .
DALE: Well , first of all , killing someone is illegal and immoral
KURT: It may be illegal but I 'm not sure it 's immoral . Sometimes one evil person has to die for the greate good of the community . If Bobby Pellit has his way , hundreds , maybe thousands of innocent Bolivians will suffer . It would actually be immoral not to kill him . Nick begins to warm to the idea .
NICK: I did n't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam because of Harken .
KURT: Exactly ! Who knows how many othe Gam Gams have died alone .
DALE: I ca n't believe you guys are actually talking about this . I do n't care how bad our bosses are . We 're not murderers .
NICK: No , we 're not , Dale . We 're just trying to live our lives . But what are we supposed to do when someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives ? Do we just end over and take it up the ass forever ?
CONTINUED: 36 .
KURT: No , we do not !
DALE: What you guys are talking about is wrong and you know it .
NICK: Julia 's ruining your life . That 's wrong .
KURT: Yeah !
DALE: She 's not ruining my life . If anything 's ruining my life it 's you guys and your drunk bullshit .
KURT: If it 's bullshit , Dale , then how come we all want to do it so much ? They reach the corner where they part ways .
DALE: I do n't want to do it . And when you sober up neither will you . We 're not killing anyone . Dale heads off .
KURT: I was just being hypothetical .
NICK: Yeah , me too . OFF their ambivalent looks
SUGGESTIVELY: Guess who ?
CONTINUED: 37 . 38 CONTINUED 38
DALE: I 'm really not in the mood fo this now
STACY: Not in the mood for what ?
DALE: For nothing . What are you doing here ? Julia appears in her office doorway .
JULIA: I invited her .
STACY: She called and said now that we 're engaged , she wanted to offer me free dental work . And you know I 've had that loose filling for a while . It 's so sweet of you , Julia .
JULIA: It 's my pleasure . You 're part of the family now .
VISIBLY UPTIGHT: Uhhhh I do n't know if this is a good idea .
STACY: Why not ?
DALE: We do n't want to take advantage of Julia .
JULIA: Dale , there 's nothing you could do that would be taking advantage of me . Nothing . Now what do you say we pump you full of gas ?
CONTINUED: 38 .
DALE: Wait no gas . She does n't need to be out .
STACY: What are you talking about , Dale ? You know I 'm not good with drills .
JULIA: You do n't want your fiancée to suffer , do you ? OFF Dale 's defeated look
STACY: Ten , nine eight seh
DALE: Hey ! Stop it , what are you ?
JULIA: You 're gon na give me that dong , Dale !
DALE: NO !
JULIA: Let 's have sex on top of her . Let 's use her like a bed !
CONTINUED: 39 . 39 CONTINUED 39
DALE: All right , that 's it , Julia . This is over . You 're out of your mind . I quit !
JULIA: I 'll tell her you fucked me !
DALE: What ?
JULIA: If you do n't fuck me , I 'll tell her you fucked me .
DALE: Tell her whatever you want . She 'd never believe you .
JULIA: She already knows you 're a sex offender . And once she sees these , I think she 'll believe me .
DALE: What is that ?
JULIA: You remember your first week here when I replaced the crown on you second bicuspid ?
DALE: Yeah ?
JULIA: I took a few snapshots of the procedure . For my files .
DALE: You you did all this while I was unconscious ?
JULIA: Yup .
DALE: How did you make it look like I was awake ?
JULIA: Taped your eyes open .
DALE: This is rape ! You raped me !
JULIA: Do n't get all dramatic . Your dick was n't hard . But it will be next time . Or else Stacy here gets a look at my photo album . She holds up the packet of photos .
DALE: Let 's kill the bitch .
KURT: Huh ?
NICK: What bitch ?
DALE: My boss . Our bosses . They need to die . Nick and Kurt exchange a look .
NICK: We were drunk last night , man . And did n't you say killing was wrong ?
DALE: That was before Julia tried to fuck me on top of my fiancée 's unconscious body .
KURT: Whoa !
DALE: I say we kill them all . Are you guys in or out ?
KURT: I was in last night .
DALE: Yes ! Nick ?
KURT: Look at her . Look at Bubby .
NICK: Gam Gam .
CONTINUED: 42 . 42 CONTINUED 42
KURT: Look at Gam Gam . Getting a smooch from her favorite grandson . Little does she know that she 'll never get to say goodbye to him . And why ? Because his shithead oss would n't let him leave . What would Gam Gam want you to do ?
NICK: Probably not kill him .
KURT: This is n't about Gam Gam . This is about you . What do you want , Nick ?
NICK: I want him to die .
KURT: Damn straight !
NICK: Okay , I 'm in .
KURT: All right ! Let 's do this .
THEN: How do we do this ?
DALE: I was thinking about that on my way over . Stacy and I watch a lot of ` Law & Order ' and there 's a ton of ways criminals mess up . Things we 'd never think of . They leave ehind clothing fibers , bullet casings , hair , skin cells
KURT: Skin cells ? ! I ca n't even keep track of my keys !
DALE: Exactly . And that 's why we need a professional .
NICK: What are you talking about , a hitman ? Dale nods .
CONTINUED: 43 .
KURT: You know , that 's not bad . I mean , we do n't clean our own apartments , ight ? We hire someone to clean them for us .
DALE: Maybe you do , moneybags .
NICK: But where are we supposed to find a hitman ?
DALE: That 's the only problem . I have no idea . There 's a beat . Kurt 's eyes light up .
KURT: I do . Meet at my place tomorrow after work . And make sure you 're not followed .
NICK: Why would anyone follow us ?
KURT: I do n't know . People get followed .
DALE: What people ?
KURT: Just meet me at my place .
NICK: Wait . You actually found someone ? !
KURT: It was as easy as buying a used futon .
CONTINUED: 44 . 43 CONTINUED 43
DALE: Craigslist ? ! You found a hitman on Craigslist .
KURT: Yup . But they do n't post it as ` hitman . ' That would be stupid . They use code words , like ` liquidation , ' ` pest control , ' ` wet work . ' Check it out . This is our guy . Nick reads the listing .
NICK: ` Skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work . Fast and discreet . No children o political figures . '
KURT: See ? He 's principled .
DALE: This is so dangerous . What if he 's a narc ?
NICK: Yeah , Kurt . Call him back and cancel .
KURT: It 's too late . He 's on his way .
DALE: What do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we ca n't afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us ?
KURT: I do n't think he 'd stay in usiness long if he killed everyone who could n't afford him .
NICK: Guys ! I think this is him ! The others hurry to look . From
KURT: Whoa . This guy 's legit .
DALE: I bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together .
NICK: All right , let 's just be professional here . We do n't want to seem all giddy . A knock at the door .
KURT: How 's my hair ?
NICK: It does n't matter !
MAN: Is one of you Kurt ?
DALE: Oh my God , he 's like James Bond !
KURT: Yes , hi , I 'm Kurt . Please come in .
MAN: Thank you . Are all three of you participating in this ?
CONTINUED: 46 . 45 CONTINUED 45
NICK: Yes , we are .
MAN: Very well . Now before we go any further , I need to know if there are any hidden recording devices in this room . I will find out if there are .
DALE: No , no ! We definitely do n't want to record this , sir .
MAN: Then let 's get started .
KURT: Whoa , whoa . What 's that for ?
MAN: For the mess .
NICK: We do n't want you to kill us !
DALE: Oh my God ! I knew it !
MAN: Kill you ? What are you talking about ? The guys exchange a confused look .
KURT: Your ad said you do wet work .
MAN: That 's correct . I urinate on other men for money .
CONTINUED: 47 .
NICK: You were looking in ` men seeking men ' ? !
KURT: Yeah ! We 're men seeking a man , are n't we ?
NICK: You are such a moron .
MAN: So you 're telling me I drove all the way to the Valley and no one wants to be pissed on ?
DALE: Please do n't kill us .
MAN: I do n't kill people ! Can I use your rest room ? I 've stored up rather a large amount of pee for this .
KURT: It 's right through there . The Man heads off . After a beat
NICK: That 's big of you .
KURT: I 'm going to make it up to you . I figured out a much better way to find a contract killer .
CONTINUED: 48 . 46 CONTINUED 46
DALE: What 's that ?
INDIAN ACCENT: Hello , Mr. Gamble , thank you fo contacting On Star
DALE: Oh , come on !
NICK: This is your plan ?
KURT: Gregory , I need you to direct me to the most dangerous bar in Los Angeles .
KURT: Okay , Gregory ? That 's unhelpful . While I 'm sure there are plenty of shitheads there , they 're not the kind of shitheads we need .
CONTINUED: 49 .
KURT: Now we 're talking .
NICK: So , do you like living in Bangalore ?
DALE: Now , ` Gregory . ' Is that your real name ?
KURT: Atmanand ? How did you get Gregory from that ?
NICK: Why do n't they let you use you eal name ?
KURT: Actually , I do find Atmanand a little off-putting .
CONTINUED: 50 . 48 CONTINUED 48
FLAT: You have arrived at you destination , sir .
KURT: This must be the place .
DALE: Are n't you worried about your car ?
KURT: Nah , Gregory 's watching it .
NICK: You really think we 're gon na find a hitman in there ?
KURT: I think we 're gon na have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there . Trust me , these are the lowest of the low .
NICK: Oh , real nice , Kurt . Way to be acist .
KURT: This is n't a race thing . We need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live . I 'm not saying that 's because there are a lot of black people here . That 's the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them .
CONTINUED: 51 . 50 CONTINUED 50
DALE: You said they were the lowest of the low .
KURT: I was speaking socio-economically .
NICK: So what do we do now ? Yell out ` anyone here kill people fo money ? '
KURT: Let me handle this .
BARTENDER: Yeah ?
KURT: Hey . How you doing ? Nice place .
LEANING IN: Listen , does anyone here kill people for money ?
NICK: Kurt !
BARTENDER: The fuck did you just say ?
KURT: Do n't get me wrong . This is n't about race . Our society discriminates and disenfranchises
DALE: Oh my God .
BARTENDER: I 'm a small business owner . Who are you calling disenfranchised ?
KURT: I did n't mean you in particular .
BARTENDER: Right . You mean all black people .
CONTINUED: 52 .
NICK: Maybe we should go ?
BARTENDER: You could do that . Or I could take the aluminum baseball bat I 'm holding in my right hand and disenfranchise your teeth from your mouth .
DALE: I vote we go . The three stand and head for the door .
KURT: Okay , we 're going . I 'm sorry if I offended you . It was never my
BARTENDER: Oh shit , please shut up .
KURT: Okey doke .

COCKSUCKER JONES: That 's my name .
DALE: Your first name is Cocksucker ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: And my last name 's Jones . You got a problem with that ?
DALE: No , no . It 's just interesting . That 's the name on your birth certificate ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: Naw , man . It 's a nickname . My eal name is Dean .
DALE: Oh ! Like Dean Jones . The acto from Herbie the Love Bug .
KURT: I do n't think he knows who Dean Jones is .
COCKSUCKER JONES: I know who Dean Jones is , bitch ! I ca n't walk around here with that kind of faggy , cracker name .
NICK: So you chose ` cocksucker ' ?
CONTINUED: 54 .
COCKSUCKER JONES: That 's right . Nobody fucks with a cocksucker . ` Cocksucker ' is the toughest name there is .
DALE: Not ` motherfucker ' ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: I considered Motherfucker . But in the end , I thought Cocksucke Jones sounded more badass than Motherfucker Jones .
KURT: I agree .
NICK: Okay , here 's the thing we each work for a boss that we need to get rid of . Is that something you might be able to help us with ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: It is . Assuming you 've got the cheese .
KURT: We 've got cheese . How much cheese are we talking ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: For three hits ? That 's gon na run you thirty large .
NICK: That 's a lot of cheese .
KURT: We do n't have that much cheese .
DALE: Is n't there any kind of discount ecause we 're buying three at once ? Like buy two , get one free .
COCKSUCKER JONES: This ai n't the motherfucking Cold Stone Creamery . It 's thirty large or nothing .
NICK: There 's no way we can pay that .
CONTINUED: 55 .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Five large .
DALE: Wow .
TO NICK: Good negotiating .
NICK: That 's a lot more reasonable . And that would be for all three , Cocksucker ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: Yeah .
KURT: Great . We 're in .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Okay , meet me back here tomorrow night with the cash . I 'll take care of the rest .
NICK: Should we bring the bills in any kind of special denominations ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: No , just , whatever . Small bills .
NICK: Got it .
KURT: And do you want it in any particular container , like a shoebox ?
NICK: Or a paper bag ?
DALE: Or plastic . I read an article that plastic is actually bette for the environment than paper .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Fuck the environment ! Just put that shit in a briefcase .
NICK: Got it . Thanks . Come on , guys . They turn to go , when Dale turns back .
CONTINUED: 56 .
DALE: Should we deduct the cost of the iefcase ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: What ? !
DALE: I mean , assuming we do n't get the case back We 're not getting the case back , right ? Cocksucker glares at him .
NICK: We 'll cover the briefcase , Dale .
DALE: Then let 's get a cheap one . It does n't have to be real leather . Are you cool with faux ?
CONTINUED: 57 . 53 CONTINUED 53
COCKSUCKER JONES: Looks like it 's all here .
DALE: Turns out we did n't really need the briefcase after all . Could 've just used a manila envelope .
KURT: Shut up , Dale .
NICK: So , Cocksucker , how long do you think it 'll be before you 've taken care of business ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: Here 's the thing . I just got out of doing a dime for some pretty ugly shit and I 'm still on probation . They 're watching me . So if I step out of line , I go ight back inside .
KURT: You told us you could take care of it .
COCKSUCKER JONES: And I 'm gon na . I 'm gon na be you professional advisor . Think of me as your murder consultant .
NICK: We do n't want a murder consultant . We want a murderer .
DALE: I knew we were getting ripped off !
KURT: Okay , look . This is n't what we talked about .
MORE: 58 . 54 CONTINUED 54 KURT Can we just get our money back , please ? Then we 'll be on our way .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Sorry , no refunds .
NICK: That 's five thousand dollars . You think we 're just gon na walk away and let you keep that ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: I think you 're forgetting who you 're talking to .
DALE: Whoa , whoa ! We do n't want any trouble .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Now either I give you the advice you paid for , or you can walk away with nothing . Up to you .
KURT: Look , the whole reason we came to you is because we do n't have the experience to do it ourselves .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Most killers are first-timers . Look , the key to a good murder is making it look like an accident . Gas leak , brakes failing , suicide , that sort of thing . If you do it ight , you wo n't even have to be there when it goes down .
NICK: That makes sense . But how would we fake three accidents ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: You need to stalk your prey , track their movements , get to know them inside and out . Where do they go ? What do they eat for breakfast ? Who 're they fucking ?
CONTINUED: 59 .
DALE: You 're talking about surveillance and recon .
COCKSUCKER JONES: But making it look like an accident wo n't be enough if the pigs can pin a motive on you .
NICK: Well , we all have obvious motives for killing our bosses .
COCKSUCKER JONES: So why do n't you kill each other 's osses ?
DALE: Hey , that 's a good idea . Like Hitchcock 's Strangers on a Train .
KURT: The Danny DeVito movie ?
DALE: Yes , the famous Alfred Hitchcock/Danny DeVito movie . You 're thinking of Throw Mama from the Train . But it 's actually the same idea . If we kill each other 's bosses there 's no link to us .
NICK: That 's pretty good .
COCKSUCKER JONES: That 's what you 're paying me for . Now ai n't that worth five grand ? The guys all AD LIB `` no 's . ''
KURT: We 're outside . You ready for a little recon ?
NICK: Yeah . I just need to get Harken to let me leave early .
KURT: What 's the difference ? He 's not going to be your boss much longer .
NICK: If I get fired before we kill Harken , this 'll all have been fo nothing . I 'll just be an out-of- work murderer .
THEN: I 'll be down in three minutes .
HARKEN: What in God 's name ? !
NICK: Sorry , sir . I 've been fighting this bug all day . I 'll just get ack to work
HARKEN: No . Go home . I do n't want you getting everyone else sick .

KURT: Okay , boys , as soon as Pellit makes a move , we tail him . It is on now .
NICK: Oh , it 's on .
DALE: Hells yeah !
KURT: Ugghhhhh , I ca n't believe how much this sucks .
DALE: I do n't get it . On TV , surveillance always looks so great . They 've got their cups of coffee . Their sunflower seeds . They talk about their lives .
CONTINUED: 62 . 59 CONTINUED 59 DALE And then , right when they reveal something really intimate , the perp appears and they spring into action .
NICK: Are we even sure he 's home ? They exchange looks .
KURT: Let 's go check it out .

KURT: Here , do this .
DALE: Got it . Wait , I do n't know what he looks like .

DALE: Got it .
KURT: Wow . This guy 's a bigge douchebag than me .
NICK: Okay , let 's split up . Look fo any intel we can use on him .
KURT: What kind of intel ?
NICK: I do n't know . I guess we 'll know it when we see it .
DALE: Hey , Nick ? Does this count as intel ?

NICK: We 've got to get that back in the ox .
DALE: I 've got it .
NICK: Look out . Let me try this .
DALE: I guess we should 've emptied the Dustbuster before we used it .
NICK: You think ?
DALE: Hey look , there 's a piece of cereal in here . Ca n't tell if that 's a corn flake or a frosted flake Kurt comes down the stairs .
KURT: Okay , my work upstairs is done . You guys ready to split ?
NICK: We need to be better prepared . That was totally dangerous and a complete waste of time .

KURT: Shall we pay a little visit to your boss , Nick ?
NICK: I guess so . But let 's make a stop first .
DALE: What did you need to get ? Nick holds up a box of latex gloves .
NICK: No more sleeve gloves .

KURT: Very .
NICK: Yeah .
THEN: I guess we 're really doing this now , huh ?
DALE: I guess so .
NICK: You know , last time with the three of us , it got a little messy . What if Kurt and I go in and you stay here and watch out fo Harken ?
DALE: Okay again , I do n't know what he looks like .
NICK: If anyone approaches the house , assume it 's him and give us a signal .
DALE: Fine . I 'll honk the horn six times .

NICK: How about you just honk once ?
DALE: People honk once all the time . You 'll be running in and out of the house .
KURT: Fine . Honk twice .
DALE: Okay
NICK: Looks like the coast is clear . Kurt tries the windows . They 're locked .
KURT: Damn . Guess we 'll have to break in the old-fashioned way .

NICK: Right . Let 's go through the back !
MRS. HARKEN: Oh my god ! What happened ? !
DALE: He had an allergic reaction . But I think he 's coming around . Do you know him ?
MRS. HARKEN: He 's my husband .
HARKEN: Wha What did you do to me ?
DALE: I injected you with your thing .
CONTINUED: 74 . 81 CONTINUED 81
MRS. HARKEN: He saved your life , honey .
TO DALE: Thank you so much ! She grabs Dale in a warm hug .
DALE: Oh , it was nothing .
HARKEN: What 's this ? What 's with the hugging ?
MRS. HARKEN: I 'm just thankful that he was here .
HARKEN: I 'll bet you are . Do you know this guy ?
MRS. HARKEN: No . We just
HARKEN: Are you fucking him , Rhonda ?
MRS. HARKEN: Oh , come on .
HARKEN: What were you doing out here , anyway ? Waiting to fuck my wife ?
DALE: I 've never met your wife
HARKEN: You need to get the hell out of here .
MRS. HARKEN: Dave , stop it . You should be thanking him . Why are you being so suspicious ?
CONTINUED: 75 .
HARKEN: Why ? Because I know you sleep around on me . And I 'm going to find out who it is .
MRS. HARKEN: You 're being ridiculous .
HARKEN: Am I ? What about Maurilio ? I see the way you look at him .
MRS. HARKEN: I am not having sex with the gardener !
NICK: I ca n't believe that idiot Dale . You realize we 're all going to jail because of him .
KURT: I ca n't go to jail . Look at these eyes . Look at this ass . They 'll e all over me .
NICK: Yeah , me too .
KURT: Well
NICK: What do you mean ` well ' ? I 'd get aped just as much as you .
KURT: No , of course you would . You 're a good-looking guy .
NICK: You think you 're more rape-able than I am .
CONTINUED: 76 . 82 CONTINUED 82
KURT: I never said that Dale enters .
DALE: Oh good . You guys are here . Did you see me out there ?
KURT: Yeah , Dale , we saw you .
DALE: Pretty neat , huh ?
NICK: No , it was n't neat ! You stabbed Harken to death in front of the whole neighborhood !
KURT: Not cool , man .
DALE: Wait , that was Harken ?
NICK: Who 'd you think you were stabbing ?
DALE: I was n't stabbing anybody . That was an epi-pen . He was having an allergic reaction to peanuts and I injected him . Kurt and Nick digest this for a beat .
NICK: So let me understand this . My oss , who we are trying to kill , was dying in front of you and you saved his life ?
KURT: Not cool , man .
DALE: Wait , you were just mad at me fo killing him and now you 're mad at me for not killing him ? !
THEN: See , this is why I needed to know what these people look like !
CONTINUED: 77 .
NICK: Hang on a sec . Maybe this recon was n't a waste of time . Now we know Harken 's deathly allergic to peanuts and Pellit has a huge stash of cocaine .
KURT: We could put peanuts in Harken 's house and rat poison in Pellit 's coke !
NICK: Everyone would assume that Pellit just got a batch of tainted drugs .
DALE: But Harken must always have that epi-pen on him . They consider this for a beat .
KURT: I bet he does n't wear it in the shower . We could put peanuts in his shampoo !
NICK: Perfect ! Two fatal accidents . And we 're not even there when they happen .
DALE: That just leaves Julia .
KURT: Tomorrow night , I 'll surveil he and figure out how to take he down .
NICK: Good . I 'll get some rat poison and take care of Pellit . Dale , think you can get some peanuts into Harken 's shampoo ?
DALE: I can do that .
KURT: All right . That just leaves us with one final thing to settle .
CONTINUED: 78 .
NICK: What 's that ?
KURT: Dale , if Nick and I were in prison , which one of us would get aped more ? OFF Dale 's confusion and Nick 's annoyance
NICK: Hey . Have you learned anything about Julia yet ?
KURT: Well , I 've learned that Dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot . How 's it going over there ?
NICK: I 'm just waiting for Pellit to go to sleep . I wonder how Dale 's doing with Harken .
REMEMBERING: Oh yeah .
NICK: What 's up , Dale ?
CONTINUED: 80 . 90 CONTINUED 90
DALE: Harken just left his house . I 'm going in .
NICK: Good luck , man .
DALE: Thanks .
NICK: Okay . Here we go . Nick reaches for the door handle as
DALE: Nick ?
NICK: What ?
CONTINUED: 81 . 93 CONTINUED 93
DALE: I 'm not sure if I can do this .
NICK: Where are you ?
DALE: In Harken 's bathroom . About to pour the nuts in his shampoo . But , I just I know he 's a real shithead , but he 's still a person , y'know ? Lights appear in Nick 's rearview mirror .
NICK: ( looking down at the at poison ,
RELUCTANTLY: Yeah . I know .
DALE: What should I do ? Should I do it ?
NICK: What the fuck ? !
DALE: What ?
NICK: It 's Harken . He 's here !
DALE: At Pellit 's ? ! Why ? !
NICK: I do n't know . He 's knocking on his door !
DALE: How would Harken even know Pellit ?
NICK: Oh my god oh my god oh my god
DALE: What ? What ? What ? !
NICK: He shot him . Harken shot Pellit !
DALE: Oh my god . Is he dead ? !
NICK: Shhhh !
DALE: What 's happening ?
NICK: Harken 's gone .
CONTINUED: 83 . 97 CONTINUED 97
DALE: What about Pellit ?
NICK: He 's not moving . He looks dead .
DALE: Shit ! What do we do ? !
NICK: I 've got to get out of here before someone sees me ! Meet me at the ar . I 'll call Kurt . Nick ZOOMS away from the curb .
KURT: Okay , let 's all stay calm and figure this out .
NICK: Calm ? How can we be calm ? I watched a man die an hour ago !
KURT: A man you were going to kill anyway .
NICK: Well
KURT: What ?
NICK: I do n't know if I had it in me .
DALE: Me neither .
CONTINUED: 84 . 99 CONTINUED 99
KURT: I ca n't believe you guys ! You ca n't just bail on a plan like that at the last minute .
NICK: You think when it came down to it , you would 've been able to murde Julia ? Kurt softens .
KURT: I do n't know . I mean , afterwards , it was kind of hard to imagine killing her . Nick and Dale turn to him , quizzically .
DALE: ` Afterwards ' ? Kurt realizes what he said .
NICK: You slept with her , did n't you ?
DALE: Oh god . Please tell me you did n't sleep with her . Kurt lowers his head .
NICK: You are a mess .
KURT: I know , I know . But it 's not my fault .
CONTINUED: 86 .
NICK: There is something clinically wrong with you .
KURT: I know . I 'm a rapscallion .
DALE: You 're not a rapscallion . You 're a whore . A filthy whore .
KURT: Hey . Not nice . And besides , I think I actually solved you problem , Dale . Julia just needed a good fucking . I bet she 's not going to mess with you anymore .
NICK: Whatever . We have bigger fish to fry right now . What do we do about Harken ?
KURT: Here 's what we do . We call the cops and make an anonymous tip that Harken killed Pellit . Boom . Harken 's in jail . Pellit 's in hell . Julia 's had the crazy fucked out of her . Our problems are solved . Boom .
NICK: Okay , but we should find a payphone . We do n't want them tracing the call to us .
COP: Are you the owner of this vehicle ?
NICK: Uh , yes . Is there something wrong ?
COP: We 've got an APB on a black Kia Spectra , license 4HIG208 .
NICK: Can I ask why ?
COP: A traffic cam caught this vehicle fleeing the scene of a crime tonight . I 'm going to need you to follow us to the station .
KURT: Officer ? This is not my car . Is it okay if I just ?
COP: All three of you , please .
DALE: They know everything . We 're dead . I ca n't believe I let you guys talk me into this !
CONTINUED: 88 .
KURT: Oh , please . We were just being hypothetical . You 're the one who pushed us to do it .
NICK: We ca n't even say anything about Harken now .
KURT: Why not ?
NICK: Uh , well , Kurt , being outside the murder victim 's house because I was planning to murder him probably is n't the best alibi in the world .
KURT: You know , I did n't actually do anything illegal , so
DALE: You broke into two people 's houses and stole a BlackBerry !
KURT: You gon na rat on me , Dale ?
DALE: Well , since I 'm the only one without a connection to the murder , yeah , maybe I will .
NICK: That means you 'd also rat on me .
KURT: Not if I rat on Dale first .
HAGAN: Gentlemen , this way , please .
NICK: I was drag racing . ( off their skeptical
LOOK: I am a drag racer . There 's no law against that , is there ?
HAGAN: Actually there is .
SAMSON: You were drag racing in a Kia Spectra ?
NICK: I do n't win a lot .
HAGAN: Here 's what I do n't understand . You 're at the crime scene . An hour later when we find your car , you just happen to be hanging out with this guy a registered sex offender
KURT: Tsk tsk .
HAGAN: and this guy whose employee ID says he works for Pellit Chemicals , the victim 's company .
CONTINUED: 90 .
KURT: Wait . My boss was murdered ? ! Bobby Pellit ? !
DALE: You want me to get you a Kleenex ?
KURT: I ca n't believe this .
TO NICK: What were you doing near his house ? ! Nick looks at him , pissed .
NICK: Where were you during the murder ?
KURT: I was making love .
DALE: ` Making love . '
KURT: Let me ask you something , Detective . Let 's say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter . Would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information ? Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him .
HAGAN: No . But he would be entitled to some sort of jail time . Because if he knew who the shooter was and did n't tell us , that would be obstruction of justice . A beat .
KURT: Well , then I 'm glad we have no idea who the shooter is , right , guys ?
CONTINUED: 91 .
LOSING PATIENCE: If you expect us to believe this is all just a big coincidence , we 're going to be here for a long time .
DALE: Okay wait !
HAGAN: No . We just brought you in fo questioning .
DALE: So , you do n't have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us ?
SAMSON: Not yet .
DALE: Well then , we 're free to go ?
HAGAN: Technically .
DALE: Come on , guys .
CONTINUED: 92 .
NICK: Nice work . Where 'd that come from ?
DALE: ` Law & Order . '
KURT: We really showed those guys .
NICK: ` We ' ? You were gon na turn us in !
KURT: For , like , a second .
SAMSON: For speeding and running a red light .
THEN: Do n't get too comfortable out there , boys . Our forensics team is sweeping Pellit 's house fo fingerprints and DNA . And they do n't miss much . We HOLD ON Kurt 's face and
CONTINUED: 93 .
KURT: We are so fucked .
NICK: Maybe it 's time to lawyer up .
DALE: I do n't have money for a lawyer . I gave all my money to Cocksucke Jones !
KURT: Hey , that 's right ! I forgot all about Cocksucker . Why do n't we ask him what to do ?
NICK: We did pay him five thousand dollars to be our murde consultant .
DALE: Actually , it was five thousand forty with the briefcase . OFF their looks
COCKSUCKER JONES: Oh damn , look who 's back . How did it go with the Strangers on a Train shit ?
KURT: Not great . We need your help .
NICK: One of our intended victims killed another of our intended victims . Cocksucker 's eyes go wide .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Shut the fuck up ! What kind of evil geniuses are you ?
CONTINUED: 94 .
DALE: We do n't even know why it happened . But the cops brought us in as suspects . What do we do now ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: First things first . I 'm gon na need another five thousand dollars .
KURT: What ? No way . You said the last five thousand would cover this !
COCKSUCKER JONES: Okay , fine . Pay for my drink .
DALE: Not the best negotiator , is he ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: Let me ask you this the guy who killed the other guy you were planning on killing , are the police after him too ?
NICK: No . They do n't suspect him .
COCKSUCKER JONES: All right , so you 're gon na need to encourage him to turn himself in , y say , kidnapping his wife and mailing him her earlobe o something .
DALE: That 's horrible .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Naw , the earlobe 's vestigial . All right , how about you trick him into confessing what he did while you wear a wire ?
KURT: A wire . That 's good .
CONTINUED: 95 .
NICK: Is that how the cops caught you when you murdered someone ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: What the hell are you talking about ? I never murdered anyone . There 's a beat .
NICK: What ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: Who told you I killed somebody ?
KURT: You did . You said you served a ` dime ' for ` some pretty ugly shit . '
COCKSUCKER JONES: It was ugly .
DALE: What was it ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: You ever see the movie Snow Falling on Cedars ?
DALE: Yes .
COCKSUCKER JONES: I got caught with a video camera making a bootleg copy of that movie .
NICK: You did ten years for video piracy ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: Hey , that 's a federal offense . They take that shit serious .
BEAT: I also made the mistake of epresenting myself at trial . May have insulted a few of the jurors .
CONTINUED: 96 .
KURT: Hold on . You 're telling me we 've een taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an Ethan Hawke movie ? !
COCKSUCKER JONES: So you do know it .
DALE: If you 're not a murderer , why do you carry that gun on your belt ?
COCKSUCKER JONES: Gun ?
NICK: I feel like such a moron .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Well , you are a moron . You do n't walk into a bar and hand a guy five thousand dollars just because he 's black .
KURT: Come on , guys . Let 's get out of here . The three of them turn to go .
COCKSUCKER JONES: Trust me on the wire thing , though . Worked for Donnie Brasco . Bootlegged that movie too .
CONTINUED: 97 .
HAGAN: You got something for us ?
CRIME TECH: We did n't find any foreign prints in the house , but we did get a DNA match for one of your suspects , Kurt Gamble .
SAMSON: Where was it ?
CRIME TECH: Pellit 's upstairs bathroom . His toothbrush . It had traces of Gamble 's fecal matter .
HAGAN: That sick bastard .
CRIME TECH: That 's not all . We found feces on Pellit 's hairbrush , face soap , floss and razor .
SAMSON: Razor ? !
CRIME TECH: The handle . Not the blade . This Gamble guy put just about everything in that bathroom up his ass .
HAGAN: All I care about is that it puts him inside the house . That 's enough for a warrant for him and his drag racing , sex offende friends . I 'll call the DA .
CONTINUED: 98 .
KURT: Okay , looks quiet . Is the tape ecorder ready ?
DALE: Fresh batteries , fresh six-hou tape , voice activated .
NICK: One of us needs to tape it to ou chest .
KURT: I 'll do it . I 'm the only one without hair on my chest .
NICK: That 's ` cause you shave it .
KURT: I do n't shave it . I wax it .
DALE: So what do we do now ? Wait fo Harken to come home and ambush him ?
NICK: I have a better idea . Let 's be in the house when he walks in . He 'll e so mad , he 'll be more likely to confess .
KURT: Right . We 'll sit there in the dark till he comes in , and then switch on a lamp . That 'll freak him out .
DALE: Hey , we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face Harken .
NICK: I 'll be in the chair .
CONTINUED: 99 .
KURT: Why do you get to be the guy in the chair ?
NICK: He 's my boss .
DALE: We could try and find more than one office chair so the three of us can spin around at the same time .
KURT: That does n't sound intimidating . That sounds like a musical number .
DALE: I guess you 're right . I 'll turn on the lamp .
KURT: So I 'm just supposed to stand there like an idiot ?
NICK: You 're recording it all . You 're the most important member of the team .
KURT: Do n't patronize me , Nick .

KURT: Mexico ?
DALE: Everyone flees to Mexico . That 's the first place they 'll look .
KURT: You 're right . What about Asia ? We could become kick boxers .
NICK: What the fuck are you talking about ?
KURT: What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment ? What if we were destined from the very eginning to become Asian kick oxers ?
NICK: What if I was destined to smack you right in the face ?
KURT: That seems like a lesser destiny . SFX Dale 's cell phone rings .

HARKEN: Now I can tell the cops that when I discovered you three killed Pellit , you tried to kill me to shut me up .

ANNIE: Liz is taking care of him . The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can
GRACE: I ca n't even get out of bed yet ! You 're already putting me in therapy ! !
ROBERT: The doctor said whenever you 're ready . Take your time . You tell us But he thinks it 'll only be a few months , then
ANNIE: Did you get her fresh towels ?
ROBERT: OK , OK .
GRACE: You all go ahead . I 'll be up by Christmas .
ROBERT: Do you want something else , honey ? We order something else ?
GRACE: No , I 'm just not that hungry .
ANNIE: Why do n't you go lie down ?
GRACE: I do n't want to lie down . I 've been lying down enough .
ROBERT: You want to watch some television ?
GRACE: Maybe look just
ANNIE: You 've got to stop doing that ?
ROBERT: Doing what ?
ANNIE: Helping all the time ! Running to he every time she trips or falls Anticipating her all the time .

ANNIE: You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself . You 're going to get up and you 're going to figure this out .
GRACE: Fine !
ANNIE: It 's still early . What 's your next class ?
GRACE: Gym !
ROBERT: What , sweetheart ?
GRACE: I want to see Pilgrim . Robert and Annie exchange an anxious look .
LIZ: Hello It 's so good to see you . How ya doing ?
ROBERT: She 's doing just grea . Are n't you kiddo ?
GRACE: I 'm fine .
LIZ: Well , come on . He 's out back now Mind how you go . It 's pretty muddy back there .
GRACE: Why is he in the back ? Why is n't he in the barn with the other horses ?
LIZ: Well , Grace , you see Pilgrim just is n't the same horse he used to be . As a matter of fact , maybe now 's not the best time to
GRACE: I really want to see him .
ANNIE: No .
RONA: Hey , darlin ' .
TOM: Hey , Rona . Sorry I 'm late .
RONA: I would n't know what to do if you were on time . They walk together towards the fairgrounds .
TOM: You 're looking fit .
RONA: Fit ? You want to check my teeth . Good crowd today . I think you 'll have some fun . You going to stay for dinner ?
TOM: If it 's not too much trouble , I thought I might .
RONA: Kind of trouble I 'm in the mood for .
TOM: Oh-oh Maybe I better get back in the truck .
THE WOMAN: He 's not good at transitions , you know ? When I want him to move from a trot to a lope , say
TOM: Well , I 'm sure that 's what you think but that 's not what I 'm seeing . You may think you 're asking for a lope , but your body may be saying something else altogether . You might be putting too many conditions on him . For instance , you might be saying `` GO , but , hey , do n't go too fast . '' He can tell that from the way you feel . You ody ca n't lie . You ever give him a kick to make him move out ?
THE WOMAN: He wo n't go unless I do .
TOM: And then he goes and you feel like he 's going too fast , so you yank him back ? And next thing you know , he 's bucking . Well , if someone told you to go , stop , go , stop you 'd buck too .
WOMAN: Excuse me . He faces the Woman
TOM: Well , that 'll happen .
WOMAN: Where did you learn all this stuff ?
TOM: What stuff is that ?
WOMAN: About horses ? I 'd love to learn more about it myself . Do you offer any private lessons for riders ?
TOM: Well Dale you know , a lot of this stuff it just nuts and bolts .
WOMAN: What do you mean ?
TOM: Well , if the rider 's nuts , the horse olts . That 's the whole lesson right there . You have a good day now Just keep on freeing yourself up . He leaves her , entering the trailer .
RONA: Oh I clear forget . You had a call from some woman in New York . She sounded pretty wound up .
TOM: I do n't any woman in New York . But from what I hear , most of them are wound up .
RONA: The number 's by the phone .
TOM: How long were you married ?
RONA: Long enough .
TOM: You ever miss it ?
RONA: Does a horse miss a saddle ?
TOM: Sometimes .
RONA: Well as a matter of fact , I do n't most of the time . She starts unbuttoning his shirt .
TOM: You know , Rona , we were n't all that good together even when we were good together .
RONA: Honey I was always good . Tom smiles as Rona leans in . They kiss .
ANNIE: You know it 's perfectly shot , it 's perfectly cropped , it 's perfectly laid out and I 'm so bloody bored , I 'd rathe uy a Motor Racing magazine Start over .
TOM: Yeah . Hello . This is Tom Booker . I got a message you called . INTERCUT ANNIE in her office
ANNIE: Oh ! Yes . Thank you for calling back . Uh , all right , let me try to explain my situation as briefly as possible You see , my daughter had an accident with her horse They were both injured and she , my daughter , she has n't been able to fully uh It was an extremely traumatic experience and uh
TOM: Well , see , truth is , ma'am , I help horses with people 's problems .
ANNIE: Well , you know , however you want to put it I got your information from the publisher of the article . I called Montana and your sister-in-law , I think , gave me this number . I 'm been hot on your trail you could say ecause I was hoping you 'd conside coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter 's horse and possibly
TOM: Ma'am , I 'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must e going through , but I 'm afraid you 've misunderstood whatever it is you read . I do n't do that sort of thing .
ANNIE: Well , if you could just come for the day . New York 's only a few hours by plane , I 'd have you home by dinner
TOM: Look , even if it was nearer , that 's just not what I do . I give clinics . And I 'm not even doing them for a while . I 'm heading back to Montana right now . I got a ranch to take care of
ANNIE: I 'll pay you for your fare . I 'll send you to Montana first class .
TOM: Ma'am , first class to Montana is a waste of good money . Now , am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah , does that mean YES in New York City ? Annie is taken aback . Tom feels badly .
ANNIE: Mr. Booker , if I could just ex
TOM: I am very sorry , ma'am . Goodbye now . He hangs up before Annie can continue .
ANNIE: Grace ? Grace , it 's mom .
GRACE: I ca n't find that charm Daddy gave me from India .
ANNIE: I brought it to you in the hospital .
GRACE: No , you did n't .
ANNIE: Grace , I put it on the table near your
GRACE: Does n't matter . Beat .
ANNIE: Have you decided about Pilgrim ?
GRACE: What about him ?
ANNIE: Well how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down
GRACE: I think we should . It 's not fair to let him suffer . He 's not much use anymore . He 'd hate living like that .
ANNIE: I think that 's very compassionate and mature way of looking at it .
GRACE: Mom ?
ANNIE: Yeah ?
GRACE: Maybe they should put me down too .
ANNIE: What ?
GRACE: I mean , I 'm not much use anymore . Why ca n't they be compassionate to me ?
ANNIE: How was the dinner ?
ROBERT: All our `` favorite '' people were there saying all their `` favorite '' things about their `` favorite '' subjects . I thought to myself , we 've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody . We 're so afraid we wo n't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with .
ANNIE: Why did you go ?
ROBERT: They 're still our friends , Annie . It 's nothing serious . You kid about them all the time And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there . He drinks Annie 's wine as she looks at him .
ANNIE: Yeah .
ROBERT: What did he say ?
ANNIE: No .
ROBERT: I was thinking Maybe we should think about the three of us going someplace warm Remember that house we rented in Bermuda The pink one with the His arm accidentally spills the wine .
ANNIE: About us going someplace warm Someplace Grace 'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses
ROBERT: I do n't understand . You just said he said no .
ANNIE: He did , but I think I can change his mind .
ROBERT: That 's the craziest thing I ever heard . Absolutely not .
ANNIE: Robert , Grace is n't adjusting to school . And she ca n't sit in this apartment all day I think it would be good for her .
ROBERT: NO ! What are you you 're serious about this ?
ANNIE: I 've called Liz . They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim . I thought we 'd stay at motels along the way
ROBERT: You 've already made arrangements ! ?
ANNIE: No . I was just researching . Calm down .
ROBERT: I come home and you tell me we 're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana ! I ca n't just pick up and leave
ANNIE: I 'm not asking you to . I 'll do it .
ROBERT: You want to do this by yourself ? How ? You ca n't take care of Pilgrim all the
ANNIE: He 'll be sedated . I know horses , Robert . I 'm the one who taught Grace how to ride .
ROBERT: What Bo- What about the magazine ?
ANNIE: I 'm in charge . I went back very soon after the accident . They did n't expect me for a couple of months . I 'll just take that time now I can still oversee things from Montana Take my fax My computer
ROBERT: No . It 's , uh No , I really do n't think it 's a good idea
ANNIE: Why ? !
ROBERT: Her psychiatrist said she needs security now stability
ANNIE: I ca n't say he 's been all that effective with her .
ROBERT: Are you a psychiatrist ? He said it takes time .
ANNIE: I do n't care what he says ! We have to do something , Robert ! I ca n't sit here and trust everything 's going to work out just y pretending it will .
ROBERT: I 'm not pretending anything !
ANNIE: What ? It is very difficult for Robert to say ;
ROBERT: I thought well , ever since the accident , I just thought we
ANNIE: Robert , we 're losing her . We 're losing her . I do n't care what the doctors say . The truth is , they do n't know anymore than we do less , when it comes to Grace This may not sound sensible or logical , ut nobody 's suggesting anything better . I ca n't explain it , Robert . I just have this feeling this annoying bloody feeling that if if , somehow , Pilgrim can be made all right then so can Grace . I just know it !
ROBERT: What if she does n't want to go ?
ANNIE: She will if you think she should .
ROBERT: And you think it 's best if I do n't come .
ANNIE: No , that 's not what I said . I 'm not a dictator . If you feel you should come , then come . Just do whatever you think is right .
GRACE: I 'm not going ! I do n't care what she says !
ANNIE: Maybe we should give him anothe sedative .
LIZ: Problem is , there are n't many volunteers . He 's already had enough to sink a battleship . You have a pin , just in case ?
ANNIE: Of course not .
LIZ: Probably best . You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio .
ANNIE: You want to take your bath ? We have to get up early tomorrow . You may not have enough time to
GRACE: Fine I 'll take my bath . She begins moving off the bed .
ANNIE: No , I do n't mean you have to . It 's just that we may not have enough
GRACE: enough time tomorrow . I know .
ANNIE: Look , if you want to take it in the morning , that 's fine .
GRACE: I do n't care .
JANNIE: Take it now .

GRACE: I already did . This morning . When you went running .
ANNIE: Oh . You did n't tell me .
GRACE: I did n't know I had to .

WOMAN: Annie Annie , sweetheart wake up .
ANNIE: Grace , look ! Grace reads the sign .
GRACE: I do n't care .
ANNIE: I do n't care .
GRACE: You were never thirteen , Mom .
ANNIE: How long is this going to go on ?
GRACE: What ?
ANNIE: You know what I mean ? Is this it now ? Is this the way we 're going to be from now on ?
GRACE: What are you asking me for ? You did n't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place now I get to decide ? Forget it ! She begins to turn away . Annie grabs her arm .
ANNIE: Who do you think I 'm doing this for ? I 'm doing this for you !
GRACE: Bullshit ! It 's about you ! About you deciding ! About you always being ight ! You always getting everything your way , controlling everybody like we work for you or something !
ANNIE: I do n't believe this !
GRACE: You just want to get away from Daddy and you 're using me to do it !
ANNIE: That 's not true ! Whatever problems you father and I are having , have nothing to do with this .
GRACE: You 're amazing ! You act like I do n't live in that house ! Do n't you think I hear the two of you ! ? Do n't you think I can tell what 's going on ? I 'm not five years old , Mom ! You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy does n't want to .
ANNIE: Did he tell you that ?
GRACE: He does n't have to ! It 's , like , so obvious you ca n't stand him .
ANNIE: That 's not true !
GRACE: Then why do you want to leave ?
ANNIE: It 's it 's not that simple to explain . I know you think it is , but it 's not . The truth is , I do n't really know what I want to do . I do n't have all the answers .
GRACE: No , you just act like you do .
PARK RANGER: You okay , ma'am ?
ANNIE: Yes . Fine .
PARK RANGER: That young lady is getting a little worried .
ANNIE: I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry
GRACE: Little .
ANNIE: Do n't they believe in signs here ?
GRACE: What would they say ? `` Ten miles to big ock . '' `` Twenty miles to bigger rock . ''
ANNIE: There was supposed to be a turn off . Did I miss it ?
GRACE: I did n't see it .
ANNIE: after left , stay on main road until ise , then What bloody rise ? ! ? What main road ! ?
JOE: Can we take a look at Bronty 's foal when we 're done here , Dad ?
FRANK: Sure . As long as she do n't mind .
JOE: There 's a kid at school says we should 've imprint-trained him .
FRANK: That 's what some folks say .
JOE: There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese . He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it 's their mom , and he flies it and they just follow . You hear 'bout that , Uncle T ?
TOM: Yeah , I hear about that .
JOE: Well , what do you think about that stuff ?
TOM: Well , Joe , I 'll tell ya I do n't know a whole lot about geese . Maybe it 's okay for them to grow up thinking they 're airplanes . But horses , as far as I can tell , ca n't fly .
JOE: We expecting company ?
TOM: I do n't believe it .
FRANK: You know her ?
ANNIE: Hello , Mr. Booker . Annie MacLean . From New York . We talked on the phone .

ANNIE: Well yes I had a trailer . It 's not like I made him run along side of the car .
TOM: All by yourself ?
ANNIE: Look ! Please ! Do n't do the `` shucks , ma'am '' thing again ! I 've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time . I 've brought him here to your neck of the mountains . Just take a look at him . If you still feel the same way , I 'll e on the road by morning and you 'll never see me again . OK ? Deal ?
GRACE: Yeah ?
TOM: Uh , I 'm Tom Booker . Your mothe around ?
GRACE: She 'll be right out . She 's on the phone .
TOM: First time in Montana ? Grace , rudely nods , still looking at the TV .
GRACE: Probably . She 's on the phone twenty- three hours a day .
TOM: What does she do ?
GRACE: She 's an editor .
TOM: Mmm . An editor .
GRACE: Not like books or literature or anything . Just a magazine Just in case she has n't told you which I 'm sure she has n't I do n't want to be a part of this , OK ?
ANNIE: Sorry about that . Hi . Grace , this is Mr. Booker Have you looked at Pilgrim ?
TOM: Uh , no . I was gon na take a look now .
ANNIE: You want us to come with you ? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check .
TOM: Does n't matter .
ANNIE: Grace ? Grace , you want to come with us , take a look at Pilgrim ?
TOM: Probably best she stays behind , anyway .
ANNIE: Well You 're closest anyone 's gotten .
TOM: I have to be honest . I still feel you made a long trip for nothing .
ANNIE: Well , that 'll be a little complicated
TOM: You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like . But she 's the one who 's gon na be riding him , am I right ? So here 's the deal . I 'm not sure I can do anything , but I 'm prepared to give it a go if you 'll help . You have a problem with that ?
GRACE: Is n't it like , obvious ?
TOM: Not to me . Either you want to or you do n't .
ANNIE: Look , I 'll talk to Grace and call you later
TOM: Excuse me , with all due respect , but this is her decision , not yours . And I do n't want to waste anybody 's time mostly mine .
GRACE: Well , there 's nothing else to do around here .
TOM: Not good enough . I ca n't help you .
GRACE: What do I have to do ?
DIANE: well , I just think she 's got a lot of nerve showing up here . Draggin ' that child and that poor animal all the way
FRANK: Oh hell , I do n't know According to Tom , she 's a pretty determined woman . Must 've thought it was worth it .
DIANE: I guess they 'll want feeding and all , out here all day long .
TOM: I do n't believe they 'll expect that .
DIANE: What , they ai n't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger .
FRANK: Mixed salad .
DIANE: What ?
FRANK: I believe women from New York eat mixed salads . Ai n't that right , Tom ?
TOM: I believe so . Saw it on a television show , once .
DIANE: Well , that 's just what we need on a cattle anch a vegetarian from New York . Everyone eats . Beat .
JOE: When you figure on branding ?
FRANK: Weekend after next
TOM: If the weather holds .
JOE: What 's an editor do anyway ?
DIANE: We 're not sure , sweetheart , but they eat like rabbits .
ANNIE: the phone company 's putting in extra lines . I 'll call back with the numbers . Oh , and I want you to get in touch with this lady in town here they say she 's sort of a physical therapist for the odeo boys but keep the one at the hospital we already contacted on call
FRANK: Tom ?
TOM: Yeah .
SMOKEY: Howdy Howdy .
ANNIE: What 's he doing ?
SMOKEY: Trying to get his eye .
ANNIE: How 's it going ?
TOM: NO LET HIM GO !
ANNIE: She 's running away ! How are you going to get him back ?
SMOKEY: He do n't really want to run . Do n't know where he 's going . All this open space scares the daylight out of him .
ANNIE: So what now ? Should we leave ?
GRACE: What ?
JOE: Does that hurt you ?
GRACE: Only when I kick somebody .
JOE: Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch .
ANNIE: You ready to go ?
GRACE: I think they call it a pasture .
ANNIE: Let 's go see what 's going on , then get something to eat .
DIANE: There 's coffee inside I was just inging this to Tom .
ANNIE: Would you mind if I did ? I 'd like to talk to him .
DIANE: Sure . Does your daughter want to come inside ?
ANNIE: Uh , no , we 're going to dinner Is this the way to the pasture ?
DIANE: Pasture ? Oh , that stretch of field nea the hill ? Yeah .
TOM: From now on , leave your phone somewhere else As he moves past her , Annie responds ;
ANNIE: But I have business calls I have to
TOM: Then drop off Grace in the morning , go on back and do your business . Come pick her up around dinner .
DIANE: Mrs. MacLean why do n't you and daughter stay for dinner ?
ANNIE: Oh uh , thank you . No , we do n't want to impose .
DIANE: No imposition . Plenty of food . Gon na get pretty dark soon . Hard to find a place .
FRANK: Dear Lord , we are humbly thankful for
EVERYONE: Amen .
FRANK: Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle .
TOM: We should be fine , then . Beat . Annie and Grace listen
JOE: Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords .
FRANK: Tell her they suit the weather better . Their udders are black , 'stead of pink .
TOM: They do n't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow . And they 're good mother .
FRANK: Our daddy raised Pure Herefords .
ANNIE: You know , that 's interesting . I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regula steak or a Black Angus steak . I could n't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender . I did n't know there was that big a difference between cows I 've never been on a cow farm before . I must say , the bulls seem to have the est time of it . Just laying around the fields all day until they 're asked to do their work .
FRANK: Well , get born a bull , got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger . On a balance I eckon I 'd choose being a cow . Would you mind passing that salad young lady ?
DIANE: How 's Peterson 's holding up for you ?
ANNIE: It 's fine . Comfortable . I still ca n't get used to how dark it gets around here , though . When we leave the ranch , I always hold my breath until I can see the motel .
FRANK: You know , Tom , while you 're working on that horse of theirs , Annie and Grace should move into the old Creek house .
ANNIE: Oh , I do n't know
FRANK: Well , I know Peterson 's . Old place is as good as falling down around your ears .
DIANE: They 're already all settled in , Frank . Anyway , I 'm sure Annie wants her privacy .
FRANK: It 's got doors , Diane . Private as can be . Tom ?
TOM: I do n't have a problem with that . It 's up to Annie .
ANNIE: Well , it 's worth it , really ? I mean , how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim ?
TOM: That 's up to Pilgrim .
GRACE: I know . Me , too . Why do n't you come one weekend ? Annie reacts to this .
ANNIE: Hi .
ROBERT: Hey She sounds like she 's doing all right . How is she ?
ANNIE: Yeah . She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch , which is why I said yes to this move . But , wheneve it 's just the two of us , I do n't know Anyway what 's happening with the Delco lawsuit ?
ROBERT: Taking forever . I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview efore Monday . I do n't know how I 'm going to do it .
ANNIE: Well , it 's good that you 're there .
ROBERT: So , how are you doing in Marlboro country ? Is the magazine complaining at all ?
ANNIE: Yeah , but nothing I ca n't handle . Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks 's plotting , but what else is new .
ROBERT: When are you coming home ?
ANNIE: You know , I just asked that myself tonight . He does n't know .
ROBERT: Well then maybe I will take some time come visit .
ANNIE: Okay .
ROBERT: I miss you , Annie .
ANNIE: I know . We miss you too .
ROBERT: Good night .
ANNIE: Night .
GRACE: Did you ask him to come visit ?
ANNIE: You already did .
GRACE: Did he mention it ?
ANNIE: Yeah , he 's going to think about it . You want me to pack for you ?
TOM: What we 're doing here , Grace , is trying to get him to learn how to e a horse again .
ANNIE: Grace ? The clinic just called They had to change your physical therapy appointment . We have to leave now .
TOM: Hello , Annie Annie notices how he says her name .
ANNIE: Mr. Booker
GRACE: If I had everything I need , I would n't e going to physical therapy . Tom approaches as he overhears Grace respond ;
ANNIE: Honey , come on . Would you like to stay in town for dinner ? Maybe see what movie 's playing tonight ?
GRACE: Why ? There 's no food in the house ?
ANNIE: No . I just thought forget it .
TOM: You know , we 're branding here tomorrow . If you two want to come y to watch or give a hand , you 're welcome .
ANNIE: Branding ? I have n't branded in years . Tom chuckles .
GRACE: I 'll come .
ANNIE: Uh , I do n't , honey . Branding ? Oooh I think we 'd just be in Mr. Booker 's way .
TOM: As long as you do n't get in the way of the branding iron , it does n't matter too much .
GRACE: I watched Margo Neuberger get a tattoo . Tom squints . Annie shrugs and nods .
ANNIE: Okay . As Grace and Annie walk to the car , Tom says
TOM: Hey , Grace maybe we can get you mom to put me and you branding on the cover of her magazine . Start a whole new fashion craze .
ANNIE: Try not to fall off your high horse , Mr. Booker .
GRACE: Did you call Dad today ? Annie is caught off guard .
TOM: Hey , over there , you want to make yourself useful ? It is n't a question .
GRACE: That 's not a question , is it ?
TOM: You 're catching on . Grace smiles .
ANNIE: It is cocktail hour yet ? Tom laughs . She takes a big breath .
ELLEN BOOKER: he was a blacksmith by trade , my father . My grandson Joe was named for him . But he always dreamed of having his own place and raising horses
ANNIE: Well , I was born in London , but my father was an ambassador and we moved constantly . I 've lived in a lot of places but I do n't really know what I 'd call home . Tom listens to this .
ELLEN BOOKER: An ambassador ! My ! That 's very important .
ANNIE: He was a wonderful man .
DIANE: I sure hope you 're gon na eat more than that , young lady . You 're a growing girl .
GRACE: I 've never eaten this much in my life .
DIANE: Probably never worked so hard , neither . Those arms of yours are gon na be pretty sore tomorrow . I 'll give you a little bit of ointment I make . It 's a magic recipe my Mama gave me .
FRANK: We used to call Diane 's mothe Medicine Woman . None of us never went to the doctor when she was alive . Annie and Grace listen in
HANK: Too bad she was n't here for old Henry Vanoker
FRANK: Not much would have helped him .
DIANE: I never got that whole story , what happened ?
HANK: Old Henry was changing a flat tire on his truck over on 118 when that two-hundred-year-old jack he has gives way and the side of that truck come slamming down on that rock he calls head
ANNIE: What happened ?
HANK: Knocked him out for a while . He woke up , finished putting on the tire and drove himself to the hospital .
DIANE: Old Fool Darling , pass down those peas for me , thank you .
FRANK: Huh , Joe here has something to say .
JOE: I wrote this for you Grandma
HANK'S WIFE: That was lovely . Who wrote that , Joe ?
JOE: I wrote it myself , ma'am .
FRANK: Now son , you tell 'em when it came from .
JOE: Be honest , I ca n't say I did it all myself . My grandma helped me get the words right .
TOM: Well , I 'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding
FRANK: And next time , Miss Annie , you can run down the calves
ANNIE: I 'll drink to that
DIANE: Oh , you can just set up on the dining table . I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow .
ANNIE: Is this Mr. Booker ? Tom 's grandfather ?
DIANE: Mm-mm . I never knew him . He died efore Frank and I met . This here 's Frank and Tom 's mother and father there 's little Frank and Tom
ANNIE: She calls him Tommy
DIANE: Always did . I think she favored him a little . You tend to when you have more than one , even though you love 'em all the same .
ANNIE: I got a little confused though . The ranch Ellen was talking about that 's not this one ?
DIANE: No . See , Frank and Tom were raised nea the Clark 's Fork River , right between the Pryor and Beartooth Mountains . Beautiful piece of land . But they had this uncle Ned useless man , never interested in anching . And when the grandparents died , he left for the city and sent word through lawyers he wanted his claim to the land so he could sell it . Three years of legation broke their father . Frank took it all in stride , but Tom Tom loved that land . I do n't think he ever got over it His home being sold out from under him . Seeing his father like that . Once he and Frank got their folks set up in a new place , Tom left went off . We did n't see him for years
GRACE: Why do you always wear that hat ?
JOE: Because it fits my head . You want to try it on ? Grace does n't know if she should .
TWINS: Show us again ! Come on ! One more time ! It 's my turn now !
TOM: All right , al right . Hold out you finger .
TWINS: Again ! Again . One more time !
TOM: Oh , no . No , no . I only fall for that once . Go inside now before your mothe starts hunting you down . Go on .
ANNIE: Do n't be so sure it 's my last . There are a few people back home I 'd like to put under a red hot iron .
TOM: You got too much sun today Here
ANNIE: Thank you .
TOM: You ever just stand still for a minute ?
ANNIE: You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger . You know , sometimes , I get the feeling , Mr. Booker , that you 're laughing at me . Why is that ? Tom shrugs . Annie waits a beat , then
TOM: Oh , I see , you write both sides of the conversation ?
ANNIE: It 's a man 's world , Mr. Booker . Most women have to .
TOM: Well , maybe I am laughing a bit I just thought , as long as you 're here , it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little .
ANNIE: Well It 's beautiful country , I 'll give you that . And I could see having some kind of vacation place . Retreat . But I do n't know how you do it full time . Do n't you miss the rest of the world ?
TOM: What 's that to miss ?
ANNIE: Ha if you 've never lived in a city with museums , theater , music , restaurants , uh god , a million things , then it 's something I ca n't explain .
TOM: Does Chicago count ?
ANNIE: You lived in Chicago ?
TOM: When I was first married .
ANNIE: You were married to a woman in Chicago ?
TOM: I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest sta with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . He played Rachmaninov 's Vocalize Opus 34 . No . 14 . It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard . I actually forgot where I was for a time . You seem surprised ?
ANNIE: Well , I , uh you did n't
TOM: Just who 's been laughing at who here ?
ANNIE: Hello ?
ROBERT: I thought you guys were going to call me .
ANNIE: Oh , Robert , I 'm sorry . We were so tired from the branding . Grace barely made it to her bed and I did n't have the energy to take my clothes off .
ROBERT: Oh well branding will do that to you .
ANNIE: Everything all right .
ROBERT: Huh-huh . You ?
ANNIE: Fine . Actually , today was a good day . You should have seen her .
ROBERT: I wish I did .
ANNIE: About what ?
ROBERT: Apparently , Gottschalk 's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors . Lucy said she tried to call you , but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names . She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon .
ANNIE: Oh . I did n't look at my faxes today . We left before sunrise .
ROBERT: Honey , I hope you 're not endangering your position . Listen , if you need to come back and you want me to come take over , for a while , I 'll work it out . I mean , the firm 's got other lawyers , but the magazine 's got only one of you .
ANNIE: I 've decided it 's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat .
TOM: A jogger , huh ?
ANNIE: I do n't jog , Mr. Booker . I run .
TOM: Lucky for you . The grizzlies around here only go for joggers .
ANNIE: If I can survive rush hour , I figure I can handle grizzlies
TOM: You sleeping all right in that house ?
ANNIE: I do n't sleep all right anywhere . But the house is fine .
TOM: Sorry about that . I thought everything got cleared out . R.B . is my wife ex-wife Rachel . We used to live in that house together .
ANNIE: I thought you lived in Chicago ?
TOM: I thought you were an editor , not a eporter ?
ANNIE: I have a way with animals .
TOM: It 's all right . He 's young . Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you .
ANNIE: Oh yes . I forgot . She does and the horse sniffs at her hand .
TOM: Why do n't you ride anymore ? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger .
ANNIE: She did ?
TOM: Just polite . Well , maybe you 'd like to try riding again , some time before you go home .
ANNIE: You too .
TOM: Need a lift ?
ANNIE: I can handle it !
DIANE: Oh , it 's I wanted to tell you that , if you 'd like , you being so busy , I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you . I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway . Annie does n't know whether or not to accept .
ANNIE: Oh Well thank you very much . I do n't
TOM: Come and take a ride with me .
GRACE: Drive ? I 'm not old enough yet .
TOM: It 's never too soon to start . He enters the passenger side .
GRACE: I ca n't
TOM: I do n't have all day . She hesitates and gets into the truck .
GRACE: I do n't know if I can with my leg .
TOM: Well , there 's only one way to find out . Give it a little gas .
GRACE: I do n't know if I can .
TOM: Not a question of if you can you are . Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the est will take care of yourself .
GRACE: We bought him in Kentucky . My mothe and I took a trip down there to see him .
TOM: That must have been pretty special .
GRACE: Are you afraid of anything ?
TOM: Getting old . Not being of much use , I guess . What went on out there , Grace ? With Pilgrim ? Grace does n't say anything . Tom nods then ;
ANNIE: Oh-oh . Tom reaches the house as Annie rises .
TOM: You have n't heard the question yet . Truth is , you 'd be doing me a favor . I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out
ANNIE: Poor thing .
TOM: He 'd be grateful , he 'd take real good care with you .
ANNIE: Is this how you 're going to make me pay my phone bill ?
TOM: No , ma'am , I 'm afraid that 's extra . She gives him a crooked smile .
ANNIE: Yeah , it 's been a while , but I I emember the basic ideas
TOM: OK . I 'll stop talking then .
ANNIE: Actually , I never rode Western . I 'm sorry . Go ahead .
TOM: Well , he do n't know that . Just sit the horse . Good You have a nice seat .
ANNIE: Thanks .
TOM: Feel good ?
ANNIE: Yeah .
TOM: You look all right . You want to pick it up a little ?
ANNIE: OK .
TOM: Watch your reins , he 'll go with you , give him some room , let him do the work . Relax , do n't grab him with your thighs , just so long as he can feel your body .
ANNIE: It 's a whole other world you have going on here . It just goes along , doing what it has to . And you 're a part of it , you just wake up and , and there you are And everything that seems like life or death some place else does n't affect any of this one bit .
TOM: Lift your leg .
ANNIE: How long did you live here with you wife ?
TOM: Five years . My son was born here .
ANNIE: Son ?
TOM: Yeah . I have n't seen him in a while . He used to come to the ranch over summers , ut then he started having friends and was going off to college , so Good boy . Hal . Lives in New York near his mom .
ANNIE: How did you meet her ?
TOM: College . In Illinois . She was playing the cello . I had n't heard cello music growing up . She had the reddest hair , the bluest eyes . When she played , it was
ANNIE: Why did n't it work out ?
TOM: She was never really happy here . She did the best she could .
ANNIE: It is . It 's lovely .
TOM: Ever think of moving there full time ?
ANNIE: We did at one point . When we thought we 'd have more children . And we afte tried . We tried everything , but was n't meant to be .
TOM: I hear that ! See , I knew she was neve going to be a ranchest , but I wanted to try I thought maybe she 'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school , maybe even recitals . My son would grow up here . Maybe have one o two more . I 'd teach 'em what I could . They 'd play with my brother 's kids . All grow up together . And even if they all decided to go out into the world , they 'd always know where home was cause we 'd keep it for 'em
ANNIE: That 's very important to you , is n't it ? Home .
TOM: Yeah , I think it is . And I do n't mean everybody 's got to be married , have kids It 's more like , knowing where you 're from , where you belong , what feeds you , where you can go no matter what happens Knowing what you 're supposed to be doing while you 're here .
ANNIE: How did you find out all that ?
TOM: I got lost . They smiles .
JOE: Hi She stops . After a beat ;
GRACE: Would you let me ride your horse ?
JOE: Have you talked to Tom about it ?
GRACE: Of course I have .
JOE: I do n't know You sure Tom said it 's all right ? She nods . He hesitates .
GRACE: Are you going to give me a hand o are n't you ?
JOE: You sure ?
ANNIE: Honey , would you see if anybody wants
GRACE: I thought there were too many forks on the table .
ANNIE: Well , one was for salad
GRACE: Mom , they do n't mind eating with one fork .
ANNIE: You 're right . Good . Grace puts them away .
GRACE: I 'll take care of it .
ANNIE: Thanks , honey . Grace nods and exits to the living room .
GRACE: Would anyone like something to drink ? We hear a CRASH in the kitchen , then
TOM: I 'll give your mom a hand .
ANNIE: Not really . I 'd forgotten how long it 's been since I 've done this . And I could n't get any Parmesan cheese .
TOM: Just make yourself comfortable .
ANNIE: I am comfortable .
TOM: Ha , ha all right , well , uh I guess you can bring out the pasta .
ANNIE: You missed a button .
TOM: Huh ?
ANNIE: Thank you .
FRANK: It 'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month
TOM: I do n't think Warren would go for that . Grace is talking to Joe and the Twins .
GRACE: like , for instance , you can go on the Internet and access this thing called The Visible Man who was this murderer they caught in Texas that was executed and donated his body to science and you can call him up on the screen and dissect him , like in Three-D
ANNIE: Well , did you ever think about hiring a business manager ?
FRANK: We have a business manager . The best around .
DIANE: Ha
TOM: Diane takes care of the books . I do n't know how , but at the end of every month , everything adds up to the penny .
DIANE: Ai n't brain surgery .
ANNIE: It 's pretty impressive . Where I come from , you 'd be a gold mine .
TWINS: This is MY fork . That 's YOUR fork , ya idiot !
DIANE: Hey . You stop that kind of talk at the table .
FRANK: I 'll have another round of that spaghetti if may ?
ANNIE: Absolutely . I made enough for an army .
DIANE: I uh I like the sauce very much . Maybe I get the recipe .
GRACE: It 's from a jar .
FRANK: Thank you . Finally , Diane saves it .
DIANE: Well , I tried jar sauce once was n't this good . Ya got ta know which brand to buy . I 'd like to get the name of this one . Annie is grateful . Grace feels foolish .
GRACE: It 's just my computer .
DIANE: Oh , I do n't
ANNIE: It 's okay . Grace , show them . I 'm going to put the coffee on . I made an apple tart for dessert .
DIANE: I 'll help you with the coffee .
ANNIE: Well I know I should reject that offer , but I 'm not going to .
DIANE: No reason you should , no reason you should .
ANNIE: I was there for that shot , actually .
DIANE: What was it like ?
ANNIE: Oh , God I think it was the fourth or fifth time I 'd been there , so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was
DIANE: I 'd love to go there one time
ANNIE: You and Frank ever take a vacation ?
DIANE: Soon . We 're going to Branson , Missouri to see my cousin Emma married . Frank loves in there .
JOE: YA JUST HAD A TURN . IT WAS NOT .
TOM: Boys ! Settle down !
JOE: Do n't be such a baby !
DIANE: JOE !
ANNIE: What does he mean ?
GRACE: Nothing .
ANNIE: Did you go riding ?
JOE: Little shit !
DIANE: Annie , I 'm so sorry , but they 're just tired . We 'll have dessert another time . Frank , get them out of here . Come on . Say good night and thank you
FRANK: Dinner was delicious . Thank you . Say thank you ! !
JOE: Sorry , ma'am , I thank you for dinner . It was very good .
ANNIE: Did Grace try to ride , Joe ?
JOE: I expect you should talk to Grace about that , ma'am . And if I did anything wrong , then I am sorry .
TOM: Do n't let her turn you away . Tom exits .
ANNIE: Grace ? Is everything all right ? Can we talk ?
GRACE: About what ?
ANNIE: Well So you tried riding again ?
GRACE: Yeah . Does that mean I 'm cured ? !
ANNIE: Honey , nobody 's trying to cure you
GRACE: You worried everything all right now and we 'll have to go home ?
ANNIE: What are you talking about ?
GRACE: You not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much .
ANNIE: Grace , I do n't hate your father .
GRACE: I ca n't remember the last time you made him dinner .
ANNIE: I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and
GRACE: Tom ?
ANNIE: Look , I just wanted to say , I think it 's great you 're riding again . And and I think I know why you , you needed to do it alone without anyone knowing
GRACE: Yeah , you know everything ! !
ANNIE: STOP IT ! Why ca n't I talk to you ! !
GRACE: NO , YOU STOP IT ! Stop pretending like you care ! Like this really is n't about you and Tom .
ANNIE: WHAT ? ! How can you I 'm sorry if my friendship with Tom others you so much , but I happen to value having someone to talk to , especially when my own daughte ignores me night and day because no matter what I say , it 's wrong and no matter what I do , it 's wrong I 'm sorry I 'm such a disappointment to you .
GRACE: Well , now you know what it feels like . Beat .
ANNIE: I do n't deserve that . I have neve looked at you as a disappointment . If I 'm on your back to do better , if I push you to try harder it 's because I want you to be the best you can be .
GRACE: FOR YOU ! Because I 'm your daughte which means you 're the best mother ! Is n't that what you 're always talking about in interviews having it all , the great career , the great family Proving everybody wrong . Wanting everybody to think you 're this perfect woman ! Beat . They 're both exhausted .
ANNIE: Listen , if if there 's a part of you as parent that that takes pride in your child that , you can look at them and see something you 've accomplished as well if that 's wrong , then I 'm sorry . But it was n't my intention . I do n't push for me . I do it for you So you do n't waste half your life feeling like you do n't know where you belong .
GRACE: Yeah , well , you 've done a great job . Beat . Annie feels deeply hurt .
ANNIE: Well , then I do apologize But what I 'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she 's feeling who ca n't admit when she 's wrong and who ca n't forgive when she 's not .
GRACE: LEAVE ME ALONE ! !
ANNIE: What did you say ?
GRACE: I said I started .
ANNIE: Started what ?
GRACE: My period .
ANNIE: When ? Tonight ?
GRACE: I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom .
ANNIE: What ? Oh baby
GRACE: Who 's ever going to want me ? Nobody will .
ANNIE: That 's not true .
GRACE: Why should they ?
ANNIE: Because you are one of the most incredible , bravest , most beautiful woman I have ever met . The efforts you make . Your courage and you dignity . I do n't know where you got it ? I honestly do n't know how I would have handled all this if I were you .
GRACE: I 'm sorry about what I said . It 's just that all those times you and Daddy were trying for anothe kid , I I used to pray at night that it would work . And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brothe or sister but just so I would n't have to be
ANNIE: What ?
GRACE: So special . Because I was the only one . You both wanted me to be so good at everything , so perfect and I was n't . I was just me . And now I 've completely ruined everything , anyway
ANNIE: Sshhh Ssshhhh They hold each other as if for dear life
GRACE: Who is it ?
ANNIE: Uh , nothing . I 'm going to pick it up in the other room would you hang this up for me ?
GRACE: Sure .
ANNIE: Okay , Grace Operator ? I 'm ready .
GRACE: I was waiting for you to come back . Tom instinctively knows what she wants .
TOM: You hungry ?
GRACE: Judith was telling me about this boy she really liked . She never even had a chance to tell me his name
TOM: I wo n't tell you it 'll stop feeling this bad But I can tell you , you did n't do anything wrong The same thing would have happened to me o Frank or Joe And there 's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen I used to try and always came up short . I do n't think the why so 's important as what we do with what we get . I remember this boy I 'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation . He was sixteen . Great kid . Strong . He 'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock . Snapped his neck , paralyzed him After the accident , I 'd look in on him from time to time and he was n't there anymore . His mind , his spirit , whatever you want to call it , it just disappeared . And what was left was nothing but anger It 's like the oy I knew just went away somewhere
GRACE: I know where he goes .
TOM: I know you do . Do n't you disappear . You do whatever you have to , to hold on I 'll tell you one more thing When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck you know what I think ? I think that damn horse loved you so much , he was trying to protect you That 's what I think .
GRACE: I ca n't not yet
TOM: There 's no hurry . Take you time .
FRANK: Play that sweet one you know . The one makes my wife here so friendly .
DIANE: You !
JOE: You would n't want to dance with me , would you ?
GRACE: I do n't thinks you 'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody .
JOE: I would n't let happen .
GRACE: You know , you 're a good kid .
DIANE: Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work , huh ?
ANNIE: Well , I have more than a few days , ha , ha I uh I 'm sort of not an editor anymore right now First time I 've said it out loud .
DIANE: They fired you ?
ANNIE: No , it 's more like a leave of- Ha , ha , ha . Yeah , they fired me .
DIANE: You do n't seem to upset ?
ANNIE: Delayed shock . Or maybe not . I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or go to another magazine , someplace Just not sure if I want to .
DIANE: Guess you do n't have to figure it out until you go home .
ANNIE: Did you always know this was the life you wanted ?
DIANE: I fell in love . After that , I neve thought about being anything but a ancher 's wife . I never saw it like I was losing some other life , just felt like I was gaining one . I know that 's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ai n't saying it 's the right one . We all have to find the life meant for us .
ANNIE: Frank 's a good man .
DIANE: They do n't come better . But I do n't deny there are times I wonder about things I wo n't have . Maybe one day I 'll get to see Egypt . Maybe not . But I know if you try too many different lives , you can wind up with no life at all
ANNIE: Sounds like something Tom would say .
DIANE: Yes , it does .
ANNIE: What ?
DIANE: Annie , I 'm not good at this kind of talk goes round and round a thing but never comes to it so let 's just say what it is . When you first came here , I did n't like you and I was worried . Tom means a lot to me and this family . Do n't go looking here for whatever you looking for . Do n't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time .
ANNIE: I do n't think anybody can make Tom do anything he did n't want .
DIANE: He 's a good man , Tom is . He 's got a gift , come from heaven above , I swear . But he 's still a man . And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake and still make him think he 's on dry land . Diane 's words ring in Annie 's head .
GRACE: Dad ? Annie looks up and sees
ANNIE: This is Mr. Booker , Robert .
TOM: Tom .
ROBERT: Hi . It 's a pleasure . I 'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here . I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere .
TOM: Oh yeah Laugh . Awkward silence
ROBERT: Well I uh I can already see a change . And I 'm very grateful to you .
GRACE: Did you notice no cane ?
ROBERT: I know . Amazing .
GRACE: Can we show him Pilgrim , Tom ?
TOM: Oh , we 're gon na show your dad plenty . Why do n't you all get settled in and we 'll do the tour . Excuse me .
ROBERT: See you later !
ANNIE: Let 's bring your bags inside .
GRACE: Wait till you see this we have the whole house to ourselves The MacLean walk to the Creek House .
ANNIE: Is there anything you need ? I 'm going food-shopping .
DIANE: Well , I am going to go after lunch .
ANNIE: No , no , I 'll go just give me a list .
ROBERT: I ca n't believe it 's the same horse .
TOM: We still have a way to go .
ROBERT: How much longer do you think ?
TOM: Well , like I told your wife , it 's eally up to Pilgrim .
ROBERT: I understand
FRANK: We thought we lost him in the snow storm Told the kids . Had a funeral for the damn thing . Finally , snow stops . Staring to warm up . I go out and start cleaning the truck Goddamn if that dog does n't jump out from the back seat covered in snow I nearly stained myself .
TOM: He thought it was a ghost .
JOE: A dog ghost ! Laughter all around .
TOM: Is the poverty worse , now , you think ?
ROBERT: I have n't been back in over twenty years , but I would n't be surprised . The population 's larger .
FRANK: What were you doing over in India ?
ROBERT: Uh , this was right after college . I was in the Peace Corps .
FRANK: That right ?
DIANE: She sure loves her daddy , huh ?
ROBERT: and I thought before I settled into law school everybody knew that was the plan I 'd take this time fo myself . Grace rises to go to the Creek House .
DIANE: I think I 'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave . Just might be his first oken heart .
ANNIE: Oh , how sweet .
ROBERT: and I have no idea what he 's saying because I do n't understand Hindu
ANNIE: You 're allergic to hay .
ROBERT: I apologize for the surprise , but the days only opened yesterday and I figured
ANNIE: You do n't have to explain . You have every right to come .
ROBERT: I can see why you put your faith in him . He 's a genuine good guy Good at what he does . That 's rare .
ANNIE: No , it 's okay . Believe me , there were plenty of times I did n't know what the hell was right .
ROBERT: How are you feeling about work ?
ANNIE: Let 's not talk about that now .
ROBERT: I feel like I 'm on a first date . Annie smiles sympathetically .
HANK'S WIFE: Oh Tom , would you check the shed and see if there 's anymore chairs .
TOM: Sure .
DIANE: I have some brownies left over . Want one ?
TOM: No thanks .
GRACE: Sure .
TOM: Smokey
FRANK: He 'll be okay , Grace . Just you hang on there a minute or two . Tom 'll get him , okay , you 'll see
TOM: There 's still something going on inside of him I ca n't reach . So me and Smokey here , we 're going to try laying him down . Okay ?
GRACE: What does that mean ?
TOM: It 's more or less how it sounds . Sometimes it 's not pretty to watch . Some horses fight it real hard . Your fella 's already shown us he likes a good fight . So if you do n't want to watch , I 'll call you when it 's done .
GRACE: I want to watch .
TOM: You got that soft rope ?
GRACE: What is he doing this ?
FRANK: It 'll be OK , Grace .
TOM: Drop the lines and come help me
GRACE: That 's enough ! Stop it !
TOM: GRACE !
ROBERT: Well maybe she should n't be here
ANNIE: Robert ! Let him handle it ! Please !
TOM: Grace , I need you to come with me .
GRACE: No , you 're only going to hurt him some more .
TOM: He 's not hurt . He 's okay . Look at him .
GRACE: No !
TOM: Grace , Listen you 've got to do this . Just trust me one more time .
GRACE: Do what ? Tom , prouder of her now than ever before .
TOM: I 'll show you .
ANNIE: What ? !
TOM: PLEASE ! Grace , do what I 'm telling you . Stand on him now !
ANNIE: It 's so cruel .
FRANK: No . He had the choice .
ANNIE: What choice ! ! ?
FRANK: Either fight the way things are o accept it .
DIANE: Oh Frank , do n't forget the wedding present it 's behind the door in the laundry room . I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue Not that they 'll know what to do with it in Branton , Missouri Probably use it as a planter .
FRANK: Diane !
DIANE: Frank 's touchy about his cousins . Well , it was nice to meet you , Mr. MacLean .
ROBERT: Same here , Mrs. Booker . Thank you again for all your kindness .
DIANE: Ah
ANNIE: I already know the way and it 's not like I have a job I have to rush home for . Between you and me , I could use the time alone . Diane understands .
DIANE: And you 'll be all right by yourself here , after they 've gone ?
ANNIE: It 's just one night . If I get uncomfortable , I 'll go over to Hanks .
DIANE: Promise ?
ANNIE: Promise .
DIANE: Good luck to you , Annie .
ANNIE: You too , Diane .
DIANE: All right , everybody in . Frank , we all set
ROBERT: Should n't we have invited Tom over ?
GRACE: I did . He said he had work to do until late . Annie remains silent .
ANNIE: Are you going to stay in the city o go up to Connecticut ?
ROBERT: Connecticut . I told the office I 'd work out of there next week . When are you planning to start back ?
ANNIE: Probably first thing in the morning . It 's too late to start now . I 'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark .
ROBERT: May I have a suggestion ?
ANNIE: Yeah , what ?
ROBERT: Take your time .
ANNIE: What do you mean ?
ROBERT: I 'll tell you something , Annie I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse And , I swear , it felt like the same thing was happening to me .
ANNIE: I do n't understa-
ROBERT: And I have two choices . I can eithe fight the way things are , or accept them . See , I always knew I loved you more . Did n't bother me . I always felt lucky a little amazed that such a vibrant , beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right if I was the best husband I could be , the best father even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant fo us if I could do all that , it would n't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not I was n't asking for more . I told myself I did n't need more . But you do n't know how you feel about me . You do n't know if you want a life with me anymore And I do n't want you to come home until you do know one way or the other .
ANNIE: What 's the matter , honey ? Gon na miss Pilgrim ?
GRACE: Tom 's gone . Both Robert and Annie are surprised .
ANNIE: Well honey you know that 's just not his way . Maybe you can write him a letter or something . Say thank you Do n't think about it You take care and I 'll see you home .
TOM: I wo n't apologize for this . And I wo n't hide it . Not for anybody .
ANNIE: I wo n't ask you to . He takes her in his arms and they kiss .
TOM: Ssshhh Stand still , Annie . Takes what we 've got , just for now . Can you do that ?
ANNIE: Show me again .
TOM: Annie !
ANNIE: One more time .
TOM: I figured , whenever you decided to go , you 'd be all set .
ANNIE: How thoughtful of you . And what if I decide not to go ?
TOM: Annie , please
ANNIE: NO ! NO ! YOU DO N'T DECIDE THIS ! NO !
TOM: I do n't know any other way , Annie .
ANNIE: Why ? Suddenly ;
TOM: You think this is easy for me ! ?
ANNIE: Then what have we been doing ? I mean what was the point ?
TOM: The point was to love each other .
ANNIE: Why ?
TOM: Because we had to And I 'll neve stop loving you , Annie . Here . Where my life is .
ANNIE: Can we go for one more ride ? Tom stops . Considers this . Then
TOM: Sure . I 'll saddle them up .
ROBERT: Yes ?
ANNIE: Hi . Um , there does n't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for `` Tubab '' who might to have a place for me to stay . Are you `` Tubab '' ?
ROBERT: No . I am a `` tubab . ''
ANNIE: What do you mean ?
ROBERT: Tubab means white man .
ANNIE: Oh , I miss you . You look beautiful .
GRACE: So do you .
ANNIE: How 's everything ?
GRACE: Good .
ANNIE: Hi .
ROBERT: Hi . They kiss as Grace watches .
ANNIE: Mmm . I made good time . Pilgrim 's in the back . I found a new stable , but they ca n't take him until tomorrow .
GRACE: Great !
ANNIE: Go ahead
ROBERT: You want to take a walk with me ?
ANNIE: Where to ?
ROBERT: I do n't know . Let 's just go and we 'll see
NARRATOR: On Monday morning , a patient named Guernsey , male , middle-seventies was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest pains .
NARRATOR: The intern who admitted Mr. Guernsey , however , accepted the diagnosis and prescribed morphine , a drug suitable for angina but not at all suitable for emphysema , which is , unfortunately , what the old man actually had . Within an hour
NARRATOR: and died at seven-thirty that evening .
SCHAEFER: Hey , Sheila , this is Howard , Sheila . Hey listen . I got us a bed fo tonight . A real , honest-to-god bed .
SHEILA: I 'll see you . Schaefer smiles , grunts , sleeps on .
NURSE PEREZ: Doctor Schaefer
MRS. REARDON: What ?
NURSE PEREZ: I 'm just telling you , Dr. Schaefe is dead .
MRS. REARDON: What do you want , Perez ?
NURSE PEREZ: Look , I do n't know what the hell this is all about , but Dr. Schaefe is in Room 806 with an I.V . running and he 's dead . I did n't even know he was sick .
MRS. REARDON: Perez , what the hell are you talking about ? Do you know what the hell she 's talking about ?
NURSE PEREZ: Well , maybe I 'm going crazy . I do n't know . Is n't Room 806 the patient Guernsey ? I mean , did something happen I do n't know about ?
MRS. REARDON: Perez , I do n't know what you 're talking about .
NURSE PEREZ: This is the nuttiest thing I eve saw . Dr. Schaefer 's in Room 806 dead .
MRS. REARDON: What Dr. Schaefer ? Our Dr. Schaefer ?
NURSE PEREZ: Our Dr. Schaefer . The one who 's always grabbing everybody 's ass .
MRS. REARDON: Do you know what she 's talking about ? I do n't know what she 's talking about . What do you mean Doctor Schaefer 's in Room 806 dead ?
NURSE PEREZ: I mean , he 's lying on the far bed , stone dead , and with an I.V . tube sticking out of him . And if you do n't elieve me , maybe you just ought to get up and look for yourself .
MRS. REARDON: All right , maybe you 'd better call Mrs. Christie . Phone RINGS .
BOCK: This is Dr. Bock Yes , Mrs. Christie , what is it ? It 's all right , I 'd be getting up in a few minutes anyway I 'm sorry I missed that . Would you say it again ? Yes , I know him , Schaefer , the stud with the glasses , who fancies the nurses I 'm afraid I do n't understand that , what do you mean ? Was he sick ? I mean , was he uh , what was the cause of death ? Was he being treated ? I do n't understand . What was he doing in the bed ? You did say he Look , Mrs. Christie , did you call the office ? Good , well , I 'll No , no , it 's all right . I 'll be getting my wake-up call any minute anyway .
GRUMBLING PROTESTERS: Two-four ! Help the poor !
DR. IVES: What do you say , Sundstrom ? How much longer do you think our monopolistic , exclusionary , racist policies will work ?
PROTESTER: We 're the hope !
SUNDSTROM: So how 's it going , Herb ?
BOCK: One of my interns dropped dead this morning .
SUNDSTROM: Really ? I 'm sorry to hear that . I understand you 've moved out to a hotel .
BOCK: Yes .
SUNDSTROM: It got that bad with Phyllis ?
BOCK: It 's been that bad for twenty-fou years . Are you going to be solicitous ?
SUNDSTROM: Yes .
BOCK: Oh , God .
SUNDSTROM: Listen , Herb , I 'm the guy who brought you into this hospital , so I think I can skip the diplomatic overtures . Marty stopped me in the hall yesterday , very upset . He had just had lunch with you and said you sounded suicidal . Marty tends to be extravagant , but he 's not the only one . Jack Singer mentioned the othe day you 've been boozing it up a lot . And let 's face it , you 've been sloughing off . I understand you have n't even been doing rounds .
BOCK: I 'm going to do rounds today .
SUNDSTROM: Herb , want a couple of days off ?
BOCK: No .
SUNDSTROM: Go down to Montego Bay , get drunk , get laid , get a little sun .
BOCK: For God 's sake , John , I 'm fifty-three years old with all the attendant fears . I just left my wife afte twenty-four years . Standard case of menopausal melancholy .
SUNDSTROM: Maybe you ought to have a talk with Joe Einhorn .
BOCK: I do n't want to see a psychiatrist . Stop worrying about me . All I have to do is get my ass back to work , and I 'll be fine . I 'm sorry I 've caused you concern .
MILTON MEAD: Sid just called from St. Luke 's , and he 's heard that the demonstrators up there are planning a march to join the bunch down here .
SUNDSTROM: Oh , God . Did you call the cops ?
MILTON MEAD: Yes .
MRS. DONOVAN: They 're all in Eight-O-Six , Doctor .
BOCK: What happened ?
MRS. DONOVAN: I think I 'll just let Mrs. Christie tell you about it .
BRUBAKER: Oh boy .
BOCK: What happened ?
BRUBAKER: I 've seen some pretty good snafus , ut this one I mean , there 's a certain splendor to this one . One of the night nurses , a float , thought Schaefer was a patient and plugged an I.V . into him . He was a diabetic , you know .
BOCK: What do you mean , a nurse plugged an I.V . into him ?
BRUBAKER: Oh , it 's really a screwed-up story , Doctor . You see , what happened was we had an old man in that bed who died last night , so the bed was available . And you know Schaefer . He 's Sammy Stud .
BOCK: And he talked a nurse into zapping him on that bed .
BRUBAKER: I think it was a girl from hematology he 's been running with .
BOCK: My God , it 's a Roman farce .
HITCHCOCK: I thought I heard you out here , Doctor . Bock makes a noise and goes into
MRS. CHRISTIE: I 'll need one from both of you , three copies , and I suggest you do that ight now . The forms are in my office
MRS. DUNNE: I 'm really so terribly sorry about this , Dr. Bock . I
BOCK: As I understand it , one of the nurses inadvertently administered an I.V . to Schaefer here . How the hell could that happen ?
HITCHCOCK: Listen , I think we ought to straighten this out somewhere else .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Yes , very good idea . Oh God , what a mess .
HITCHCOCK: I suppose I 'd better call the Medical Examiner .
BOCK: I still do n't know what happened .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Well , it took an hour to get it sorted out . It seems a patient named Guernsey died last night in Eight-O-Six , but that information was n't given to the night nurses . These things happen .
BOCK: I get the drift , Mrs. Christie . In other words , Nurse Perez went in and sedated Dr. Schaefer thinking it was the patient Guernsey . My God ! What I do n't understand
MRS. CHRISTIE: If I may finish , Doctor . Well , afte Perez gave him his shot , she noticed the I.V . on the bed had been pinched off , and she reported that back to Mrs. Reardon , who then assigned Nurse Rivers to restart the I.V . Now Rivers was a float . She did n't even know the staff people on the floor , and nobody knew what the patient Guernsey looked like anyway , since he 'd only been admitted that morning .
BOCK: So she plugged an I.V . into him .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Yes .
BOCK: How much ?
MRS. CHRISTIE: A liter .
BOCK: A five percent glucose solution wo n't kill anybody . Did he have any othe ancillary conditions ? He was n't dehydrated , was he ? Did n't anybody other to go in to check him during the night , even under the impression he was merely a patient ? Was he hyperasthmolic ? Did he have a bad heart ? He must have had some kind of thrombosis . I want the post done here , Mr. Hitchcock . And you and I etter have a little chat , Mrs. Christie , about your excessive use of float nurses .
MRS. CHRISTIE: I 've got nearly a thousand nurses in this hospital .
BOCK: And every time one of them has he period , she disappears for three days . My doctors complain regularly they ca n't find the same nurse on the same floor two days in a row . What the hell am I supposed to tell that boy Schaefer 's parents ? That a substitute nurse assassinated him , ecause she could n't tell the doctors from the patients on the floor ? My God , the incompetence here is absolutely radiant ! I mean , two separate nurses walk into a room , stick needles into a man and one of those was a number eighteen jelco ! tourniquet the poor sonofabitch , anchor the poor sonofabitch 's arm with adhesive tape , and it 's the wrong poor sonofabitch ! I mean , my God ! Where do you train your nurses , Mrs. Christie ? Dachau ! ? All right , wrap him up and get him down to Pathology . I 'm especially interested in his blood sugar . A liter of glucose never killed anybody . Your ladies must 've done something else to him .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Will there be anything else , Doctor ?
BOCK: No .
HITCHCOCK: Before you call the family , Doctor , I wish you 'd talk to Mr. Mead about this . We 'd like , naturally , to avoid litigation .
MISS LEBOW: Coffee ?
BOCK: Find out if Dr. Einhorn is in his office yet .
MISS LEBOW: Which Dr. Einhorn ? Ophthalmology o Psychiatry ?
BOCK: Psychiatry . Never mind . I 'll look in myself . He lumbers across the room and out into
EINHORN: Of course . Bock goes in , closes the door behind himself .
BOCK: I 've been having periods of acute depression recently . Apparently , it 's becoming noticeable . A numbe of people have remarked on it . Anyway , John Sundstrom thought it might be a good idea if I spoke to you about it .
EINHORN: Do you want to sit down , Herb ?
BOCK: No . I 'm not good at confessional . Well , what can I tell you ? The last year , two , three it goes way back , I suppose . I can remember entertaining suicidal thoughts as a college student . At any rate , I 've always found life demanding . I 'm an only child of lower-middle-class people . I was the glory of my parents . My son the doctor . Well , you know . I was always top of my class . Scholarship to Harvard . The boy genius , the brilliant eccentric . Terrified of women , clumsy at sports . God , Joe , how the hell do I go about this ?
EINHORN: I understand you just separated from your wife .
BOCK: I left her a dozen times . She left me a dozen times . We stayed togethe through a process of attrition . Obviously sado-masochistic dependency . My home is hell . We 've got a twenty- three-year-old boy I threw out of the house last year . A shaggy-haired Maoist . I do n't know where he is , presumably building bombs in basements as an expression of his universal otherhood . I 've got a seventeen- year-old daughter who 's had two abortions in two years and got arrested last week at a rock festival for pushing drugs . They let her off . The typical affluent American family . I do n't mean to be facile about this .
EINHORN: How serious are your suicidal speculations , Herb ?
BOCK: I amuse myself with different ways of killing myself that do n't look like suicide . I would n't want to do my family out of the insurance .
EINHORN: Digitalis will give you an arrhythmia .
BOCK: A good toxologist would find traces . Potassium 's much better . Sixty milli equivalent . Instantaneous . Of course , then you 're stuck with how to get id of the hypodermic . Forty milli equivalent . Gives you plenty of time to dispose of the evidence .
EINHORN: You seem to have given considerable thought to the matter .
BOCK: You ought to know a man who talks about it all the time never does it .
EINHORN: I do n't know . I see a man who 's exhausted , emotionally drained , iddled with guilt , and has been systematically stripping himself of his wife , children , friends , isolating himself from the world . Are you impotent ?
BOCK: Intermittently .
EINHORN: What does that mean ?
BOCK: It means I have n't tried in so long , I do n't know . Let 's just drop the whole thing , Joe . I feel humiliated and stupid . All I have to do is pull myself together and get back into my work . I 'm sorry I troubled you . Take care of yourself . I 'll see you .
BOCK: All set ?
BRUBAKER: Yes , sir .
BOCK: Who 's that exotic group ?
BRUBAKER: You got me . They 've been here about an hour .
BOCK: Dr. Perry said he picked the tuberculosis and the liver nodes fo today , right ?
BRUBAKER: Yes , sir .
BOCK: Good . Because that 's the one I studied up . A hell of a case .
MRS. CUSHING: Is there anybody seated who has n't een to see me first ? Is there anyone here who has n't given me their health insurance number ? Her phone RINGS . She picks it up .
NURSE: Give me that one again thirty- two ?
PARANOID LADY: They follow me everywhere . Three big lack men . Naked , completely exposed . Right in the street . Hanging down to their knees . Disgusting . They 're waiting out there for me now
MRS. CUSHING: Did you call upstairs and tell them to admit a patient named Mitgang ?
MRS. ARONOVICI: The concussion ?
MRS. CUSHING: I do n't know . They just called me . They said you did n't fill out the chart . And where do you come off sending anyone up to Admitting without my okay ?
MRS. ARONOVICI: Sally , would you get the fuck out of here . The patient 's in the Holding Room . You want his Blue Cross number , you go in and you get his Blue Cross number .
MRS. CUSHING: Do you mind , please
NURSE: O.P.D . wants to know how that asthmatic they sent down is .
DR. SPEZIO: She 's fine . We 'd like to keep he here a little while .
MRS. CUSHING: May I see you a moment , Doctor , if you do n't mind .
DR. SPEZIO: I 'll be right back .
MRS. CUSHING: If you do n't mind , Doctor , is this your handwriting ? Spezio stops , sighs , examines the paper .
DR. SPEZIO: The kid had a collar fracture . We had him in the O.R . We reduced it and we gave him a small cast . He strides off .
MRS. CUSHING: But did you give him a sling ? You must have taken X-rays . How am I supposed to make up the charges ? She turns into
MITGANG: I 'm Mitgang .
MRS. CUSHING: Do you carry Blue Cross , Blue Shield , Mr. Mitgang , if you do n't mind ? Mitgang , eyes closed , emits a sound .
NURSE: Will you leave that man alone ?
MRS. CUSHING: Do you mind if I at least ask this gentleman to fill out his chart ?
DR. SPEZIO: Why do you say that , Mrs. Cushing ?
MRS. CUSHING: Because he would n't give me his Blue Cross number , Dr. Spezio .
DR. SPEZIO: Oh , Christ .
CHIEF ENGINEER: I mean , they gave me a hard time , Con Ed . `` For Pete 's Sake , '' I said , `` this is a hospital . One of ou feedlines just blew '' Mead 's phone RINGS and he picks it up .
MILTON MEAD: Yeah ?
CHIEF ENGINEER: I mean , it 's lucky we traced it in time .
MILTON MEAD: No , I 'll be right up . Have we covered about everything ?
ADMINISTRATIVE RESIDENT: Dr. Kish has been driving me nuts with the O.R . schedule .
MILTON MEAD: He 's supposed to see me about that . He moves across his office into
MEAD'S SECRETARY: This is the Emergency Room . One of the doctors just died of a heart attack .
MILTON MEAD: One of our staff ?
MEAD'S SECRETARY: I think so . Mead frowns , leans back into his own office .
MILTON MEAD: Tom , you want to go down to the Emergency Room ? One of our doctors just died .
HITCHCOCK: What ? Another one ?
MILTON MEAD: Yeah , see what that 's about . I 'll be on Holly Eight . I 'll be right ack .
DR. IMMELMEN: It 's no longer pilferage , Milton . It 's reached the point of piracy . That 's the third microscope this month .
MILTON MEAD: Why do n't we get together on this sometime this afternoon , Fran ?
DR. IMMELMAN: One o'clock ?
MILTON MEAD: One o'clock will be fine . He turns left and heads for
MRS. DONOVAN: Your brother 's in the room , Mr. Mead .
MILTON MEAD: What room is it ?
MRS. DONOVAN: Eight-O-Six .
MILTON MEAD: For heaven 's sake , Willie , you 're going to be in the hospital for two lousy days . What 're you making such a fuss about ?
WILLIAM MEAD: You 're supposed to be such a big wheel here .
MILTON MEAD: There are no private rooms available . If they brought in Jesus Christ fresh off the cross , I could n't get Him a private room .
WILLIAM MEAD: I 'm not going to stay in a room with a dying man
MARILYN MEAD: He 's not dying . They 'll screen him off . You wo n't even know he 's here .
MILTON MEAD: If you want a private room , go on home , and I 'll call you the first one that comes up . But you 're the one who phoned me in a panic , you 're going on a vacation . For heaven 's sake , Willie , they 'll cut this polyp out tomorrow morning . You 'll be home Thursday , you 'll be in Miami Friday . Marilyn , will you talk some sense into this lunatic ?
MARILYN MEAD: Well , you said it , he 's a lunatic .
WILLIAM MEAD: Big wheel , ca n't even get me a private oom .
MILTON MEAD: I 'll get you a tranquilizer He exits .
BOCK: five , a full abdomen contrasted to wasting elsewhere ; six , ascites with a protein content above fou grams ; unexplained anemia , leukopenia , unexplained elevation of the serum gamma globulin level , especially abnormal flocculation tests , and of course , a positive P.P.D . All these findings assume special significance among Negroes . This has been a very commendable workup , as commendable a workup of an F.U.O . as I can remember . The staff of this floor is to be applauded . It 's a reportable case , Brubaker . Write it up . Well , let 's go have a look at the girl .
SUTCLIFFE: Nurse ! Nurse , who 's the Senio Resident on this floor ?
NURSE: That would be Dr. Brubaker . But I 'm afraid he 's at Chief of Service rounds ight now . Sutcliffe points off right .
SUTCLIFFE: That 's this way ? The nurse nods indifferently .
BOCK: I wonder if there might not be some correlation between hepatic tuberculosis and drug addiction . Presumably , there was an early consideration of S.B.E .
BRUBAKER: Yes , sir . We discounted it afte epeated blood cultures were negative .
BOCK: You , Ambler . Is that right , Ambler ?
AMBLER: Yes , sir .
BOCK: What else do you look for in bacterial endocarditis ?
AMBLER: Some sort of embolic phenomena , sir .
BOCK: Good .
SUTCLIFFE: Dr. Brubaker , I wonder if I could see you for a moment ?
BOCK: Still a little icteric . Who 's got an opthalmoscope ?
BIEGELMAN: It was n't done , sir .
BOCK: Do n't you think that 's an important test to differentiate S.B.E . from miliary T.B . ?
BIEGELMAN: No , s
BOCK: Not you , Biegelman . Ambler .
AMBLER: Well , there 's about a seventy percent incidence of false-positive latex in
BOCK: You have been reading up . If the diagnosis were S.B.E. , would a positive latex indicate anything in the therapy ?
AMBLER: We 'd expect the latex to become negative .
BOCK: If ?
AMBLER: If the antibiotic therapy were successful .
BOCK: Are you applying for your internship here ?
AMBLER: I 'm not sure .
BOCK: Come and see me . Would you sit up for a minute ?
BRUBAKER: We 've got a little thing over here , Doctor . The girl over there is the daughter of the patient in Eight-O- Six . He is at the moment comatose and requires intravenous feeding and meds .
BOCK: All right , wait a minute . Let me have all that again .
BRUBAKER: As a matter of fact , Doctor , this is Dr. Biegelman 's case .
BOCK: Never mind the professional ethics , what happened ?
BRUBAKER: I do n't know why I 'm covering fo that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion anyway . The patient , a man of fifty-six , was admitted to the hospital ten days ago for a check-up , in good health , no visible distress . We did the mandatory work-up on him . Blood cultures , stool , L.E . preps , chest , E.K.G. , all negative . But there was apparently some evidence of protein in his urine . I do n't know how that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion eve found out about it . Maybe he had some kind of deal with one of the girls in the lab . Anyway , he turned up the next day , conned the patient into signing an authorization for a iopsy
BOCK: What sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion ?
BRUBAKER: Some post-grad fellow named Ives . Elroy Ives . I never met him . He 's on one of the immunology research programs .
BOCK: Are you trying to tell me some post- grad fellow came up here and did a iopsy on the patient ?
BRUBAKER: Yes , sir . He conned Biegelman with that old story about
BOCK: protein in the urine ?
BRUBAKER: Yes , sir .
BOCK: And he biopsied the man ?
BRUBAKER: And he nicked a vessel , and at two o'clock in the morning , they woke up Biegelman because the nurse found the patient in shock . Biegelman called the kidney people for a consult right away . What was there to see ? The man was sour and bleeding . We spoke to this fellow Sutcliffe , and he referred us to a surgeon named Welbeck
BOCK: Welbeck ? ! That barber !
BRUBAKER: You ai n't heard nothing yet . So we finally got Welbeck around four in the morning . He said , go ahead . So they laid on the surgery for eight . Welbeck turns up , half-stoned , orders an I.V.P. , clears him for allergies
BOCK: without actually testing .
BRUBAKER: Right .
BOCK: And the patient went into shock
BRUBAKER: and tubular necrosis . They lopped out the bleeding kidney , ran him ack to the room , and we sat around waiting for three days to see how obstructed he was . Fever began spiking like hell , euremia , vomiting , so we arranged hemodialysis . He 's putting out good water now . But some nurse goofed on his last treatment . A leak in the tube , something . His blood pressure plunged . They ran him right up to I.C.U. , checked out vital signs , all normal except he 's comatose . That was two days ago .
BOCK: In short , a man came into this hospital in perfectly good health , and , in the space of one week , we chopped out one kidney , damaged the other , reduced him to coma and damn near killed him .
BRUBAKER: Yes , sir . A great sad serenity has settled over Bock .
BOCK: You know , Brubaker , last night I sat in my hotel room , reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide . Then I said `` No , Bock , do n't do it . You 're a doctor , a healer . You 're the Chief of Medicine at one of the great hospitals of the world . You 're a necessary person . Your life is meaningful . '' Then I came in this morning and find out one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses who mistook him for a patient because he screwed a technician from the nephrology lab
BRUBAKER: Hematology , sir .
BOCK: And now you come to me with this gothic horror story in which the entire machinery of modern medicine has apparently conspired to destroy one lousy patient . How am I to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this ? You know , Brubaker , if there was an oven around , I 'd stick my head in it . What was the name of that sonofabitch from Farkis Pavilion again ?
BRUBAKER: Ives , sir . Elroy Ives . Somebody ought to ream his ass .
BOCK: I 'm going to ream his ass . And I 'm going to break that barber Welbeck 's ack . I 'm going to defrock those two cannibals . They wo n't practice in my hospital , I 'll tell you that !
BRUBAKER: What 'll I tell the girl , sir ? She says we have no legal right to stop her from taking her father out . She 's willing to sign an A.O.R . form .
BOCK: Let him go . Before we kill him .
DR. LAGERMAN: Hi , Herb
BOCK: Get me Dr. Gilley . Put him on page if you have to . I want to talk to him right now . I do n't care if he 's operating . And you get me some monkey named Ives . Ives . I-V-E-S , first name Elroy . He 's in the Farkis Pavilion .
DR. LAGERMAN: Herb
BOCK: I want to talk to you , Joe . Would you mind coming into my office ? He strides , followed by Dr. Lagerman , into
DR. LAGERMAN: Listen , Herb
BOCK: I also want to know what the hell kind of a dialysis room you 're unning . I just came from The phone RINGS . Bock seizes it .
DR. LAGERMAN: Ives is dead , Herb . That 's why I 'm here . This gives Bock pause . He blinks at Lagerman .
BOCK: What do you mean , Ives is dead ?
DR. LAGERMAN: I mean he 's dead . He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room .
BOCK: He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room ?
DR. LAGERMAN: Yeah .
BOCK: What the hell is this ? Some kind of plague ? Where is he now ?
DR. LAGERMAN: They were just taking him down to Pathology .
HITCHCOCK: and the next thing anybody knew , about three hours later , Mrs. Cushing from Accounting came in and said there was a dead man in the Holding Room .
BOCK: You do n't find anything grotesque about all this ?
HITCHCOCK: What do you mean ?
BOCK: I mean , at half past eight this morning , we meet over a doctor who 's een killed intravenously , and here we are again , four hours later , with another doctor who had a heart attack in the Emergency Room .
HITCHCOCK: Well , what 're you suggesting Doctor ? Do you think we have a mad kille stalking the halls of the hospital ? Presumably , Dr. Ives died of a heart attack and Schaefer in a diabetic coma . People do die of these things . It 's all perhaps coincidental , but I do n't think I 'd call it grotesque .
BOCK: How long are they going to be on Schaefer 's post ?
DR. LAGERMAN: No thanks .
BOCK: Oh God , I need a drink . He goes down
NURSE DEVINE: Mead .
NURSE DEVINE: Mr. Mead Mr. Mead , I have an injection for you .
NURSE DEVINE: Well , honey , we got a witch-docto in Eight-O-Six , and you better go in there . You know that Indian that was sitting in Eight-O-Six all night ? He 's still there , and the girl 's there , and they 're doing some voodoo in there , and I ai n't kidding .
MRS. DUNNE: What are you talking about ?
NURSE DEVINE: I mean that Indian 's in there , half- naked and going pis-pis-pis with a little bag . You just better get in there , Mrs. Dunne .
BARBARA: Look , it 's a perfectly harmless ceremony , nothing to get excited about . It 'll be over in a few minutes anyway . Mr. Blacktree is a shaman who gets his power from the thunder , and it 's imperative he conclude his ituals while the storm is still going on .
NURSE DUNNE: Visiting hours were over at nine o'clock , Miss . Bock reaches for the door to the room .
BARBARA: All that 's going on in there , Doctor , is a simple Apache prayer for my father 's recovery .
BARBARA: The markings he 's made on my father 's arms are from the pollen of the tule plant . The twigs have no significance other than they 've been struck by lightning and are consequently appeals to the spirit of lightning . It 's all entirely harmless , a religious ceremony , not a medical one .
BOCK: You do n't seriously believe all that mumbo-jumbo will cure him ?
BARBARA: On the other hand , it wo n't kill him , Doctor . They regard each other levelly .
BOCK: Okay . Go ahead .
BARBARA: Thank you .
BOCK: Miss Drummond , are you still taking your father out ?
BARBARA: Yes . I still have to arrange an ambulance service . Is there a phone around I could use ?
BOCK: Use my office .
BARBARA: Thank you .
BARBARA: Hello . I 'd like to arrange an ambulance for one-thirty tomorrow afternoon Thank you
BOCK: You believe in witchcraft , Miss Drummond ?
BARBARA: I believe in everything , Doctor .
BOCK: Like a drink ?
BARBARA: Yes .
BOCK: What the hell am I supposed to say to that , Miss Drummond ?
BARBARA: No , no , you miss the point , Doctor . Not my father 's conversion mine . You see , I had been hitting the acid pretty regularly at that time . I had achieved a few minor sensory deformities , some suicidal despairs , ut nothing as wild as fluency in an obscure Apache dialect . I mean , like wow , man ! I mean , here was living afflatus right before my eyes ! Within a week , my father had closed his Beacon Hill practice and set out to start a mission in the Mexican mountains . And I turned in my S.D.S . card and my crash helmet and followed him . It was a disaster , at least fo me . My father had received the evelation , not I . He stood gaunt on a mountain slope and preached the apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians . I masturbated a great deal . We lived in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit and crushed piñon nuts . It was hideous . Within two months , I was ack in Boston , a hollow shell and dizzy with dengue , disenchanted with everything . I turned to austerity , combed my hair tight and entered nursing school . I became haggard , driven and had shamelessly incestuous dreams about my father . I took up with some of the senior staff at the hospital . One of them , a portly psychiatrist , explained I was generated by an unresolved lust fo my father . I apparently cracked up . One day , they found me walking to work naked and screaming obscenities . There was talk of institutionalizing me , so I packed a bag and went back to my father in the Sierra Madre Mountains . I 've been there ever since . That 's three years . My father is , of course , mad as a hatter . I watch over him and have been curiously content . You see , Doctor , I believe in everything .
BOCK: Now what was that all about , Miss Drummond ?
BARBARA: I thought I was obvious as hell . I 'm trying to tell you I have a thing for middle-aged men .
BOCK: I admire your candor .
BARBARA: You 've been admiring a lot more than that .
BOCK: You 're wasting your time . I 've been impotent for years .
BARBARA: Rubbish .
BOCK: What the hell 's wrong with being impotent ? My God , you kids are more hung up on sex than the Victorians ! I 've got a son , twenty-three . I threw him out of the house last year . Pietistic little humbug . He preached universal love and despised everyone . He had a blanket contempt for the middle class , even its decencies . He detested my mother because she had petit bourgeois pride in her son the doctor . I can not tell you how utishly he ignored that rathe good old lady . When she died , he did n't even come to the funeral . He thought the chapel service an hypocrisy . His generation did n't live with lies , he told me . `` Everybody lives with lies , '' I said . I grabbed him by his poncho , dragged him the full length of our seven-room despicably affluent middle-class apartment and flung him out . I have n't seen him since . But do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears . He shrieked at me `` You old fink ! You ca n't even get it up anymore ! '' That was it , you see . That was his eal revolution . It was n't racism and the oppressed poor and the wa in Vietnam . The ultimate American societal sickness was a limp dingus . Hah ! My God , if there is a despised and misunderstood minority in this country , it 's us poor impotent astards . Well , I 'm impotent and proud of it ! Impotence is beautiful , aby ! Power to the Impotent ! Right on , aby !
BARBARA: Right on .
BOCK: When I say impotent , I do n't mean merely limp . Disagreeable as it may e for a woman , a man may sometimes lust for other things , something less transient than an erection , some sense of permanent worth . That 's what medicine was for me , my reason for being . When I was thirty-four , Miss Drummond , I presented a pape efore the annual convention of the Society of Clinical Investigation that pioneered the whole goddam field of immunology . A breakthrough ! I 'm in all the textbooks . I happen to be an eminent man , Miss Drummond . And you want to know something , Miss Drummond ? I do n't give a goddam . When I say I 'm impotent , I mean I 've lost even my desire for work , which is a hell of a lot more primal a passion than sex . I 've lost my raison d'etre , my purpose , the only thing I ever truly loved . It 's all rubbish anyway . Transplants , antibodies , we manufacture genes , we can produce irth ectogenetically , we can practically clone people like carrots , and half the kids in this ghetto have n't even been inoculated fo polio ! We have assembled the most enormous medical establishment eve conceived , and people are sicke than ever ! We cure nothing ! We heal nothing ! The whole goddam wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes ! That 's what I mean when I say impotent ! You do n't know what the hell I 'm talking about , do you ?
BARBARA: Of course , I do .
BOCK: I 'm tired , I 'm terribly tired , Miss Drummond . And I hurt , and I 've got nothing going for me anymore . Can you understand that ?
BARBARA: Yes , of course .
BOCK: Then can you understand that the only admissable matter left is death ?
BARBARA: Sounds to me like a familiar case of morbid menopause .
BOCK: Oh Christ .
BARBARA: Well , it 's hard for me to take you despair very seriously , Doctor . You obviously enjoy it so much .
BOCK: Oh , bugger off . That 's all I need now , clinical insights . Some cockamamie twenty-five-year-old
BARBARA: Twenty-seven .
BOCK: acidhead 's going to reassure me about menopause now . Look , I 'd like to be alone , so why do n't you beat it ? Close the door and turn off the lights on your way out .
BARBARA: Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt , but it was the only thing I had to come to the city with . Back at the tribe , I wear ankle-length uckskin .
BOCK: Swell . Just close the door and turn off the lights .
BARBARA'S VOICE: What 're you shooting , Doc ?
BOCK: Leave me alone
BARBARA: Potassium . You take enough of this stuff , it 'll kill you , Doc . It occurred to me that I might have ead you wrong , that you really were suicidal . So I came back .
BOCK: Who the hell asked you !
CAMPANELLA: Well , I 'll see you .
BOCK: You would n't be awake .
BARBARA: What time is it ?
BOCK: I swiped this for you out of the nurses ' locker room . I 'll make good on your dress . I 'm afraid it 's torn eyond repair . Buy yourself a new one or , if you like , give me you size and I 'll send it on to you . But I want to talk to you about that .
BARBARA: Talk to me about what ?
BOCK: About your father . You really should n't move him in his condition . I just had a look at his chart . There 's no reason to presume brain damage . You know as well as I you ca n't predict anything in these instances . He could pull out of that coma at any time . I think you should let him stay here . I 'll personally look after him .
BARBARA: Is this your way of saying you 'd like me to stay in town a few more days ? He turns to look at her , smiles back .
BOCK: Well , that would be nice , too . She sips her coffee .
BARBARA: I expect you can call me Barbara , considering you ravished me three times last night .
BOCK: Three times ?
BARBARA: Oh , look at him , pretending he did n't count . You were as puffed up as a toad about it . Punched a couple of holes in your crusade for universal impotence , did n't it ? I think we 're on a first name basis by now . I 'll call you Herb .
BOCK: Let 's give your father a week , Barbara , what do you say ?
BARBARA: No , I do n't want my father in this hospital . I had a dream about this hospital . I dreamt this enormous starched white tile building suddenly erupted like a volcano , and all the patients , doctors , nurses , attendants , orderlies , the whole line staff , the food service people , the aged , the lame and you right in the middle were stampeding in one hideous screaming suicidal mass into the sea . I 'm taking my father out of here and as quickly as I can .
BOCK: You 're a real fruitcake , you know ?
BARBARA: Well , let me put it this way . I love you . I fancied you from the first moment you came lumbering down that hallway upstairs . I said to Mr. Blacktree , `` Who 's that hulking bea of a man ? '' The Apaches are reverential about bears . They wo n't eat bea meat ; they never skin bears . Bear is thought of as both benign and evil , ut very strong power . Men with bea power are highly respected and are frequently said to be great healers .
BOCK: Swell . Now , look , do you have a hotel , some sort of accommodations where you can stay for a week or so ?
BARBARA: All right , let me put it this way , Herb . My father and I accept the implacability of death . If he dies , he dies , but I 'm taking him out of here and back to Mexico about one o'clock this afternoon . I want you to come with us , because I love you and want children .
BOCK: I 'm afraid Mexico sounds a little too remote for me .
BARBARA: We could use you down there , you know . There 's a curiously high incidence of T.B . And you 'd be a doctor again , Herb . You 'd be necessary again . If you love me , I do n't see what other choice you have .
BOCK: What do you mean , if I love you ? I aped you in a suicidal rage . How did we get to love and children all of a sudden ?
BARBARA: Oh , for heaven 's sake , Herb , I ought to know if a man loves me or not . You must have told me half a hundred times last night you loved me . You murmured it , shouted it ; one time , you opened the window and bellowed it out into the street .
BOCK: I think those were more expressions of gratitude than love .
BARBARA: Gratitude for what ?
BOCK: Well , my God , for resurrecting feelings of life in me I thought dead .
BARBARA: Well , my God , what do you think love is ?
BOCK: Okay , I love you , and you love me . I 'm not about to argue with so elentless a romantic . Well , then , since we have this great passion going for us , I do n't see why you wo n't stay on here in New York for a week or ten days
BARBARA: It 's up to ten days now .
BOCK: As long as it takes for your father 's condition to improve .
BARBARA: No . I 've had these prophetic dreams for seven nights . Seven is a siniste number . The meaning of these dreams is very clear , seven times as clear . I am to get my father and you out of this hospital before we are all destroyed .
BOCK: You 're certifiable ! My God , half the time you 're a perfectly intelligent young woman , and then suddenly you turn into a goddam cabalist who elieves in dreams , witchcraft and ear power ! And I do n't like the way you dismiss my whole life as unnecessary . I do a lot of healing ight here in Manhattan . I do n't have to go to Mexico for it . I also teach . I send out eighty doctors a year into the world , sometimes inspirited , at least competent . I 've uilt up one of the best damned departments of medicine in the world . We 've got a hell of a heart unit here and a hell of a kidney group . A lot of people come into this hospital in big trouble , Miss Drummond , and go out better for the experience . So do n't tell me how unnecessary I am .
BARBARA: Yeah ?
BOCK: Yeah .
BARBARA: So how come , eight hours ago , you were trying to kill yourself with an overdose of potassium ?
BOCK: Where are you going now ?
BARBARA: My hotel . I have to check out . Mr. Blacktree does n't speak any English .
BOCK: Well , you 're coming back , of course .
BARBARA: Of course . I have to settle the bill here and pack my father . And I think you need a few hours alone to make your decisions .
BOCK: What decisions ?
BARBARA: You 're a very tired and very damaged man . You 've had a hideous marriage and I assume a few tacky affairs along the way . You 're understandably eluctant to get involved again . And , on top of that , here I am with the preposterous idea you throw everything up and go off with me to some barren mountains of Mexico . It sounds utterly mad , I know . On the other hand , you obviously find this world as desolate as I do . You did try to kill yourself last night . So that 's it , Herb . Either me and the mountains or the bottle of potassium . I 'll be back in an hour or so . I 'll e in my father 's room .
BOCK: All right . I love you ! My God !
POLICE CAPTAIN: I repeat . I 'm asking you to come out peacefully . These buildings are condemned and unfit for habitation .
MRS. BASSEY: complete sympathy with the tenants . So the hospital has assumed the esponsibility of finding 400 housing units in good buildings . The hospital wishes to point out that this particular row of buildings on First Avenue was condemned by the City efore the hospital acquired ownership , and even then , only afte esponsible leaders in the community had approved the building of our new drug rehabilitation center .
SUNDSTROM: Goddammit , Barry , I 've got a dozen community leaders waiting for me in the library ! We 've been trying to work out some kind of negotiable formula for two years ! And with no help from you people in the Urban Affairs Division , I might add !
WELBECK: Having your troubles , eh ? Well , I wo n't take much of your time . My name 's Welbeck . I 've been associated with this hospital for six years , and , yesterday afternoon , Dr. Gilley called me to say he was cutting off my privileges at the hospital . Do you know anything about it ?
SUNDSTROM: It 's news to me .
WELBECK: He said he sent the report on .
SUNDSTROM: I 'll probably get it tomorrow . Report on what ?
WELBECK: Well , I 'm not sure myself . I did a nephrectomy on a man about seven days ago . Emergency , called in at four in the morning . The man was hemorrhaging , he 'd gone sour
SUNDSTROM: Welbeck , I 'm terribly sorry , but I do have this meeting . In any event , there 's nothing I can do about it . If Gilley wants to cut your privileges , he 's Chief of Surgery , it 's within his province . You 'll have to have the hearing He exits , followed by Welbeck into the
WELBECK: I have a laparotomy laid on for this morning . I assume I 'll be allowed to go through with that .
SUNDSTROM: Of course .
WELBECK: I 've been associated with this hospital for six years
SUNDSTROM: Now , now , Welbeck . It seems to me I 've had your name down here before for something I 'll be in the staff room . He and Welbeck pass out into the
SUNDSTROM: Wait a minute . You 're the fellow with the Medicaid collecting business who incorporated and went public , ight ? I mean , something like that ? Milton Mead was telling me about you just the other day . You 're a whole medical conglomerate . You 've got a Factoring service , a computerized illing company , and a few proprietary hospitals , a few nursing homes . Good heavens , Welbeck , you should n't be ought up before a committee of mere doctors . You should be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission . You 'll have to go through with the hearing , Welbeck . I do n't interfere in these things .
VOICES: no goddam halfway house , no way , aby ! We ai n't gon na wait 'til 1973 to deal with this problem ! We want to kill the drug thing right now ! imperializing the Blackaporican community , and we reject the bourgie- ass middle-class black traitors and flunkies who are selling out the Blackaporican proletariat masses to the expansionist , racist policies of this shit hospital !
WOMAN: Let 's get back to the abortion issue !
VOICE: Sit down , Woman !
WOMAN: What the hell does the male establishment know about abortions ? There 's an agitated reaction in the crowd .
BLACK WOMAN: Who the hell raised the issue of irth control ? The issue at hand is the control of drug addiction in this community and in the ghetto generally . A black man jumps up and points off right .
BLACK MAN: We do n't want no goddam abortion A white doctor jumps in from the left .
WHITE DOCTOR: Let 's let 's get down to the core of this matter .
MAN: The point is that this hospital is the landlord for those buildings and they should 've turned them down .
SUNDSTROM: Please , please , please !
WILLIAM MEAD: You know , I hallucinated last night . I hallucinated there was an Indian doing a war dance in here .
NURSE CHILE: You were n't hallucinating , Mr. Mead . There was an Indian in here last night .
WILLIAM MEAD: There was ? They wheel him out into
NURSE: Dr. Norris says about half an hour .
SECOND NURSE: Tell Shirley it was just an ovarian cyst .
THIRD NURSE: Shirley , it was just an ovarian cyst !
VOICE: Oh , thank God .
MRS. KIMBALL: All right , Jerry , go up to Holly Six .
ORDERLY: William Mead from Holly Eight .
MRS. KIMBALL: Hold him there , Tom . We 've got somebody coming out right now .
CIRCULATING NURSE: Yeah . Number three , Marty .
RESIDENT: It 's legal for a doctor to incorporate in New York , is n't it , Doctor ?
WELBECK: Since last September . If they had that when I was your age , I 'd have put away a couple of million by now . It gives you a variety of deferral devices , profit-sharing for example . Let 's say you pick yourself an Octobe 31-fiscal . You declare a bonus payable in '71 . An accrued item payable to a principle share-holder must be paid within two and half months after the close of the year to get the deduction in the prior year . But you corporation does n't pay that tax , ecause we 've eliminated the taxable income with the bonus . With two taxable entities , you can bury a hell of a lot of expenses Hello , this is Welbeck , any messages ? Well , I 'm at the hospital . I have to cut open some guy in a couple of minutes . I 'll try to make it as fast as I can . How urgent did he say it was ? Well , Dr. Hogan made those arrangements with the underwriters . The Registration Statement was filed with the S.E.C . well over a yea ago If he calls again , have me paged here . The really big money is in health leasing , of course . Dr. Hogan , the eminent orthopedic surgeon , and I incorporated a leasing company and went public last year . I hold a controlling interest in a number of proprietary hospitals , nursing homes and rest farms , and I 've been leasing hospital equipment to my own hospitals at excessive rates . Why , you ask , am I draining my own hospitals ? Well , my hospitals are taxed at 48 percent , and I 'm giving my leasing company a hell of a price-earnings ratio , which 'll balloon the market value of the stock . I hold three hundred thousand shares of that stock , lettered of course , but in a year , I 'll dump those shares at a capital gain and walk off with a bundle
DR. MALLORY: Mangafranni , right ?
SCRUB NURSE: Right .
DR. MALLORY: What do you say , huh ? We 're not going to hang it in the Louvre , you know .
DR. CHU: Bring a mask over .
RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST: There 's no pulse , Doctor .
DR. CHU: What 's the pressure ?
RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST: There 's no blood pressure , Doctor .
DR. CHU: No pulse . Get the tube and E.K.G .
DR. MALLORY: What 's the matter ?
RESIDENT: I ca n't feel a thing , sir .
DR. MALLORY: What the hell happened ?
DR. CHU: I do n't know . She must have thrown an embolus . She was doing fine up to now . Did you check the gasses ?
RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST: I did , sir .
DR. CHU: The only time I ever saw anybody conk out like this , some jerk switched the nitrous oxide and the gas lines .
DR. MALLORY: Get the damn leads on . For Chrissakes , what the hell is this ? !
RESIDENT: She 's just a young woman , sir . Do you think we should open the chest ?
DR. MALLORY: She 's fifty-three , you buttonhead !
RESIDENT: Bicarb ?
DR. CHU: She 's fibrillating , Doctor .
DR. MALLORY: Jesus H. Christ !
DR. CHU: Okay , stop for a minute Doctor
DR. MALLORY: You got those paddles ready ?
DR. CHU: I may be crazy , Doctor , but I do n't think this is your patient .
DR. MALLORY: What the hell are you talking about ? He massages away . Another rib cracks .
BOCK: Now , I do n't want to get into an institutional hassle with you , Mrs. Christie . The malpractice here is monumental . As you see , Dr. Schaefer 's lood sugar was twenty-three . No glucose solution is going to do that . The only thing that will do that is at least fifty units of insulin , probably more . The only presumption is that one of those nurses on the Eighth Floor shot fifty units of insulin into Schaefer 's blood stream , either by injection or through the I.V. , although how in God 's name Mrs. Christie 's electric pocket-pager BEEPS .
MRS. CHRISTIE: I 'm very sorry , Doctor . May I ?
MISS MCGUIRE: Doctor , did you ask the head nurse on the eighth floor to let you know when a Miss Drummond got there ?
BOCK: Yes .
MISS MCGUIRE: Well , she just got there .
BOCK: Thank you .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Oh , dear me , Dorothy . I better get ight down there directly . Have you called the O.O.D. ? And you bette call Dr. Gilley . And you better call Mr. Sloan Yes , I 'll be down directly . I 'm very sorry , Doctor , but there 's a real nasty one in the O.R . They 've just operated on the wrong patient
MRS. KIMBALL: well , I do n't understand , is she ack in her room ? When did she get ack to her room ? Who brought he ack ? She 's back in her room .
HITCHCOCK: Who ?
MRS. KIMBALL: Mrs. Mangafranni , the woman who was supposed to have been operated on Are they still working on that woman in Three ?
NURSE: Yeah .
MRS. KIMBALL: I 'm sorry , Mrs. Fried , would you say that again ? Well , nobody in this office sent her back up Well , all ight , Mrs. Fried , I 'll have to call you back . She hangs up , stands , goes out into
MRS. CHRISTIE: What happened ? Hitchcock shrugs helplessly .
MRS. KIMBALL: I do n't know what happened . A patient named Mangafranni was scheduled fo a hysterectomy at ten o'clock Dr. Mallory . I talked to Sylvia in the Holding Room who admitted her , so she was here . And now I just spoke to Mrs. Fried on Holly Five , and she says an orderly brought Mrs. Mangafranni back to her room about twenty minutes ago . Now Mrs. Mangafranni is in her room sleeping .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Well , who 's the woman in the operating oom ?
MRS. KIMBALL: I do n't know .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Is she dead ?
MRS. KIMBALL: Well , they had to open her up , and that 's not good .
HITCHCOCK: I better get Mr. Mead .
BLACK PANTHER: abortion clinic ! That 's genocide , aby ! You 're just killing off blacks ! We consider proliferation elemental to the class struggle ! and by
SUNDSTROM: for God 's sake ! We 've got eleven people in these buildings , and we 've got to get them out of there ! We can ectify the injustices of the world tomorrow , but right now , for God 's sake , can we get those people out of those buildings ? Will you people please listen to me ? Will you people please shut up and listen to me ? Will you people please call a halt to this participatory democracy and address ourselves to the immediate problem ? !
MILTON MEAD: How long ago did this happen ?
HITCHCOCK: About half an hour .
MILTON MEAD: Have you called the Medical Examiner ?
HITCHCOCK: Not yet .
MILTON MEAD: Well , you 'd better do that now . And you better call the precinct station house as well .
DR. CHU: Good morning .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Good morning , Doctor .
DR. CHU: This is really something , is n't it ? I thought she looked a little different when they brought her in . I even said to one of the nurses , `` She looks a little younger without her dentures . '' I 'd only talked to her half an hour before .
MRS. CHRISTIE: Does anybody know who she is ?
CIRCULATING RESIDENT: Her chart says Mangafranni . He acelet says Mangafranni . The only thing that is n't Mangafranni is the woman . Dr. Mallory finally explodes .
DR. MALLORY: Jesus H. Christ ! I 've been chopping out three uteruses a day for twenty years , and is it too much to expect for you people to bring in the right goddam Jesus Christ uterus ? !
DR. CHU: I had just been talking to her in the Holding Room . She was perfectly fine . A little drowsy . I thought it was funny that when they brought he in , she was out cold .
DR. MALLORY: Jesus H. Kee-rist !
MRS. CHRISTIE: Well , we 'll just all have to stay here until Mr. Mead or someone from the O.O.D . comes back .
DR. MALLORY: Well , I 'm not taking the rap fo this ! I 've already got one malpractice suit pending , and I 'm not taking the ap for this one !
BOCK: Look , you 're not going . I love you , and I 'm not going to let you go . He picks up the suit lying on the bed .
BARBARA: I ca n't make it here , Herb . I 'll crack up . I cracked up once already . One week here , and I 'd be running naked through the streets screaming again . I can retain my sanity only in a simple society .
BOCK: For God 's sake , Barbara , you ca n't seriously see me living in a grass shack hunting jackrabbits for dinner ? Be sensible for God 's sake .
BARBARA: I am being sensible . What is it you 're so afraid of leaving here ? You plastic home ? Your conditioned air ? Your synthetic clothes ? Your instant food ? I 'm offering you green silence and solitude , the natural order of things . Mostly , I 'm offering me . I think we 're beautiful , Herb .
BOCK: You make it sound almost plausible .
BARBARA: I do n't know why you even hesitate . What 's holding you here ? Is it you wife ?
BOCK: No , that 's all over . I suppose if I 'm married to anything , it 's this hospital . It 's been my whole life . I just ca n't walk out on it as if it never mattered . I 'm middle-class . Among us middle-class , love does n't triumph over all . Responsibility does .
BARBARA: Herb , do n't ask me to stay here with you , because I love you , and I will . And we 'll both be destroyed . He turns to her again . They both look away .
BOCK: I 'll come with you .
LAGERMAN: Herb , you asked me to find that dialysis nurse .
BOCK: What dialysis nurse ?
BARBARA: I 'll go pay the bill .
LAGERMAN: The one who goofed on your patient , Drummond . Bock turns back to Lagerman .
BOCK: What do you mean , she died on the operating table in O.R . Three ?
LAGERMAN: That 's the one . I just identified her .
BOCK: What the hell 's going on around here ? Every time I try to find somebody in this hospital , they either died of a heart attack in Emergency or of anesthesia shock in an operating oom .
LAGERMAN: Listen , I just came from the O.R . They 're trying to find a Dr. Schaefer . Do n't you have a kid named Schaefe in your service ?
BOCK: I had a Schaefer . He died yesterday of an overdose of insulin . What do they want Schaefer for ?
LAGERMAN: The Holding Room nurse says there was a Dr. Schaefer hanging around the Holding Room . It would n't have een your Schaefer anyway . The nurse says it was senior staff , a middle- aged man .
BOCK: There 's no senior staff named Schaefe in this hospital .
LAGERMAN: I told them that . I said , I do n't know any senior staff around here named Schaefer . They 've got detectives down there , everything . It 's a whole ig investigation .
DRUMMOND: I am the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca .
BARBARA'S VOICE: For heaven 's sake , Dad ! What the hell 's going on ?
BARBARA: We all thought you were at Death 's Door ! What 're you doing out of bed ?
BOCK: As a matter of fact , he said , `` I am the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca . '' And you 'd better close the door , because if he 's going to tell everyone who walks in here he 's the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca , they 'll put us all away . He 's already killed two doctors and one nurse .
DRUMMOND: I am the wrath of the lamb and the angel of the bottomless pit .
BARBARA: What do you mean he killed two doctors and a nurse ?
BOCK: I mean , he 's killed two doctors and a nurse ! And he just tried to kill me ! He has something against doctors . Somehow he got hold of a thousand units of insulin and put it in Dr. Schaefer 's intravenous solution . And somehow he got Dr. Ives to die of a heart attack in the middle of the Emergency Room . And somehow he got a dialysis nurse named Campanella to die of anesthesia shock on an operating table ! He 's been running around the hospital wearing Dr. Schaefer 's uniform . Right now , they 're looking all over the place for this mysterious Dr. Schaefer . I know this all sounds as grotesque to you as it does to me , ut you can see for yourself you father is not the helpless comatose patient we thought he was . Do n't look at me like I 'm the one who 's crazy . Ask your crazy father !
DRUMMOND: I was merely an instrument of God . I killed no one . They all three died y their own hands , ritual victims of their own institutions , murdered y irony , an eye for an eye , biblical etribution . Schaefer was first , you see , because he killed God . God was admitted to this hospital last Monday under the name of Guernsey
GUERNSEY: Rise up , Drummond . You are dead , now you are restored .
DRUMMOND: Well ! Not quite the burning bush perhaps but prodigal enough for me . I was to avenge the death of God and my own brutalization . I was to kill Doctors Schaefer , Ives and Welbeck and the dialysis nurse Miss Campanella , whose negligence caused my coma .
SCHAEFER: Hey Sheila , this is Howard , Sheila . Hey listen , I got us a bed fo tonight . A real , honest-to-god bed .
SHEILA: Boy , I sure hope nobody walks in .
SCHAEFER: That 's my insulin . Put it back .
SHEILA: What do you take insulin for ? Diabetes ? I did n't know you were a diabetic .
SCHAEFER: It ai n't contagious , do n't worry about it .
BOCK: And you put Schaefer 's insulin into the I.V . jar .
DRUMMOND: Yes . And then a second nurse came and plugged the I.V . jar into Schaefer . God clearly intended a measure of irony here . The hospital was to do all the killing for me . All I need do was arrange for the doctors to become patients in thei own hospital . Accordingly , the next morning , I set out for Dr. Ives . I put on Dr. Schaefer 's uniform , pinched some digoxine from the pharmacy and a sandbag from a utility cart , and found my way to Dr. Ives ' laboratory . I coshed him with the sandbag , gave him a massive shot of the digoxine . This , you see , brought on an instant condition of cardiac arrhythmia . When he came to , I brought him down to the Emergency Room .
AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS: Not breathing ! Not breathing !
MISS ARONOVICI: She 's taking a little pulse .
DR. SPEZIO: Get an anesthesiologist , one-five- one-five
DRUMMOND: the fractures , infarcts , hemorrhages , concussions , boils , abrasions , the colonic cancers , the cardiac arrests the whole wounded madhouse of our times
MAN'S VOICE: I wonder if I could have a minute of your time , Doctor
DRUMMOND: I am the fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca .
NAMELESS MAN: Well , it 's an honor and a privilege , Doctor . I 've been here ten minutes , I ca n't seem to get anybody to help me . I 'm suffering from some sort of amnesia . I ca n't remember my name . As a matter of fact , it 's pretty screwy . I got mugged . Two hours ago , walking out of a coffee shop on Fifty- Seventh Street and Second Avenue , eight o'clock in the morning , broad daylight , I got mugged . A sixteen- year-old girl walks up to me , shows me a knife about a yard long and says , `` Give me your wallet . '' I thought she was kidding . I mean there 's hundreds of people walking right by . Well , she was n't kidding . `` Listen , '' I said , `` all I got 's about twenty ucks . '' So she takes the wallet anyway . So I said , `` How about leaving me my identification ? '' I mean , I had my driver 's license , my Diner 's Club , my credit cards . But she took them all , the whole damn wallet , credit cards , everything . So I stopped some guy , I said , `` Hey , you see that girl there , walking away ? '' He says , `` Yeah . '' I said , `` She just stole my wallet , credit cards and everything . '' He says , `` Well , that 's what they want , the credit cards . '' So I started looking for a cop . I mean , go find a cop , right ? Well , I finally find a cop . The girl 's halfway to South America by now , probably bought the ticket with my credit cards . So the cop says , `` What 's your name ? '' And you want to know something ? I could n't think of my name . The girl took all my identification , you know what I mean ? She took all my credit cards . So I said , `` You know this is screwy . I ca n't think of my name . '' So he took me to the station house . The sergeant says , `` What 's your name ? '' I said , `` I do n't know ! She took all my credit cards ! '' So they took me down here . So what do you think , Doctor ? I 'm nuts , right ? I finally flipped .
MRS. CUSHING: Who 's number 7-6-8-0-2-S ? Is there anybody here who is that number ?
DRUMMOND: In this way was it revealed to me the manner of Nurse Campanella 's death . She was to die of the great American plague vestigial identity .
BOCK: Why X-Ray ?
DRUMMOND: Well , at X-Ray , a sedated body lying around unattended for five hours would n't seem unusual .
BOCK: Of course .
DRUMMOND: Her operation that is to say , Mrs. Mangafranni 's operation was not scheduled until nine-thirty . So at nine-fifteen this morning , I rang for my nurse
BOCK: You rang for your nurse ?
DRUMMOND: To insure one full hour of uninterrupted privacy .
BOCK: Oh yes .
DRUMMOND: I got up , wheeled Miss Campanella off to the operating rooms , replaced her bed with Mrs. Mangafranni 's , exchanged charts and identity acelets . She died officially of anesthesia shock . But , in point of fact , she died because she was wearing another woman 's identity .
BARBARA: God , what do we do now ? Let me take him back to Mexico . It 's a simple world there . If you turn him in , they 'll just cage him in the Rockland State Hospital for the Criminally Insane . Let me take him back , Herb .
BOCK: Are you kidding ? We 'll both take him . I 'm going with you ! Get him dressed . We 're getting out of here efore the police put us all in Rockland State .
DRUMMOND: I have n't finished my work here . I have this Welbeck to dispose of . I am the angel of the bottomless pit and the wrath of the lamb .
BARBARA: Oh dear , he 's having anothe evelation .
BOCK: Look , that ambulance must be here by now . You go down and get them . I 'll give him a shot of something to knock him out . We 'll take him to the airport in the ambulance .
DRUMMOND: You 're hallucinating again . William Mead just stares at Drummond .
MRS. DONOVAN: Edwards never showed up . I 'm short- staffed as hell . It 's just me and Felicia . It 's like Sunday . Nobody 's here .
DR. BIEGELMAN: I 'll be at lunch
MRS. DONOVAN: Yeah , you got ta send me somebody Oh yeah ?
MEAD: We 'll be in Eight-O-Six .
MRS. DONOVAN: then what did she say ?
WELBECK: I 'm Dr. Welbeck . I have a patient on this floor named Drummond , and I 'd like to see his chart .
MRS. DONOVAN: I 'll call you back .
WELBECK: Oh , Dr. Bock . Can I have a few minutes of your time , sir ?
BOCK: No .
WELBECK: Dr. Gilley tells me you 're the one who initiated these proceedings against me .
BOCK: I 'm busy , Welbeck .
WELBECK: I 'd like to know what you have against me .
BOCK: You turned up half-stoned for a simple nephrectomy eight days ago , botched it , put the patient into failure and damn near killed him . Then , pausing only to send in your bill , you flew off on the wings of man to an island of sun in Montego Bay . This is the third time in two years we 've had to patch up your patients ; the othe two died . You 're greedy , unfeeling , inept , indifferent , self-inflating and unconscionably profitable . Aside from that , I have nothing against you . I 'm sure you play a hell of a game of golf . What else do you want to know ? Welbeck 's pocket-beeper BEEPS .
WELBECK: Excuse me for a moment , Doctor . This is Dr. Welbeck . Were you paging me ? How much do you make a year , Bock ? For a guy who makes a lousy forty , fifty grand Hello , Arthur , I understand you 've een trying to reach me all morning Bock turns and heads back for
WILLIAM MEAD: I 'm telling you , Milton , he pulls out all the wires and the tubes , and he gets up and puts on a doctor 's uniform , and he goes out , and he murders doctors ! He just went out ten seconds before you came in !
MILTON MEAD: This is Mr. Mead , are you paging me ?
WILLIAM MEAD: A couple of hours later I wake up again , and the guy in that bed there is getting out of the bed
MILTON MEAD: Are the police still in the building ?
HITCHCOCK: Yes .
MILTON MEAD: You 'd better get them up here . Yes .
WILLIAM MEAD: All day long , he lays there like a dead man . All of a sudden , in the middle of the night , he gets out of ed ! I thought I was going crazy !
MILTON MEAD: Yes , this is Mead Oh , dear . When ?
WILLIAM MEAD: You know what he says to me ? He says , you 're hallucinating . Listen , I just saw a naked Indian . Now , I 'm seeing a ghost . I got to figure he 's right , I 'm hallucinating , right ?
MILTON MEAD: I 'll be down directly . Never rains but it pours . A fire just broke out in one of those condemned buildings . The squatters in the building came out . The police tried to arrest them and , apparently , the situation has erupted into a iot . I 'm sure you 're wondering what this is all about , Herb .
WILLIAM MEAD: You 're not going to leave me alone in this crazy place , Milton !
MILTON MEAD: Mr. Hitchcock is staying with you . You better call the cops , Tom .
WILLIAM MEAD: Milton ! Milton ! Milton ! ! ! The door slams .
MILTON MEAD: I have n't the time now , and I 'm not even going to try to tell you this curious story my brother just told me . I 'll fill you in on it at lunch some time .
BARBARA: The ambulance is here .
BOCK: Yeah , but your father is n't . He 's disappeared . He put on Schaefer 's uniform and has gone out to do God 's work , presumably the murder of Dr. Welbeck . Except , that fellow on the phone over there is Dr. Welbeck .
WELBECK: Oh my God , Arthur ! What are you talking about ? Have you talked to Dr. Hogan about this ?
BOCK: And , on top of everything else , the other patient in your father 's room overheard his whole confession and just told the Chief Administrator of the hospital . They 're sending fo the cops .
WELBECK: Oh , my God , Arthur . Well , who held title ? Do the underwriters know about this yet ? Oh my God ! Arthur , what 're you waiting for ? Arrest the son of a bitch ! Turn him in ! Oh my God ! When ? Of course , Arthur , call me right back . I 'm at the Holly Pavilion , Eighth Floor . Please ! Right away ! He hangs up .
BOCK: Are you all right , Welbeck ?
WELBECK: All right ? ! That son of a bitch is trying to wipe me out ! My partner , the eminent orthopedic surgeon , Dr. Noel Hogan , is a miserable thief . And he 's trying to wipe me out !
MRS. DONOVAN: Mr. Drummond 's chart , Doctor .
WELBECK: What room is it ?
MRS. DONOVAN: Eight-O-Six .
WELBECK: I 'm expecting a phone call . Put it straight through to me in that room .
WILLIAM MEAD: What is this ? Who who is this guy ?
HITCHCOCK: Yes , well , I 'll be at the Nurses ' Desk , Sergeant . It would be futile for me to try to explain this to you over the phone .
WELBECK: You 've got a bit of fever , Drummond , ut you 're coming along very well .
WILLIAM MEAD: I 'm not Drummond , you monkey ! Drummond 's the other bed !
WELBECK: That 's mine . It 's Welbeck here Yes , Arthur , go ahead
WILLIAM MEAD: I 'm getting out of this nuthouse !
BOCK: All right , take it easy , Mr. Mead .
WILLIAM MEAD: I came in here just to get a lousy polyp cut out .
WELBECK: Oh , my God , what do you mean ? How many transactions were there ? Bu ut Arthur , I I borrowed against that stock ! I 'm in the hole for ove three hundred thousand !
WILLIAM MEAD: I 'm a sick man ! I 'm supposed to have peace and quiet !

AIDEN: Get you guys some to-go boxes ?
LOU: I would like you to die . And then I would like you to leave .
JACOB: I really do n't see the appeal . It 's like a glorified bath .
NICK: Jacob . Son . The hot tub is the whole thing ! You ski all day . Then you hit the town , get trashed , and lure some fine ladies back to the lodge for some good old fashioned tubbin ' .
JACOB: Fuck it .
LOU: Well ?
JACOB: I 'm not convinced this is anything more than a bath , but it 's nice .

ADAM: I 've never ridden the horse before .
NICK: You 're not riding the horse . The horse is heroin . Adam ca n't stop moving and fidgeting .

BLAINE: Guys !
TAD: I mean , that 's if Blaine thinks it 's cool and everything . Blaine takes a deep breath , annoyed .
TO JACOB: Get your spaz brother out of here . And for his sake , I do n't wan na see him back on my mountain .

BLAINE: This is mine now .
JACOB: Come on . Let 's just go .
ADAM: What is going on ?
LOU: Guys ! I 'm so glad you 're here . I want to introduce you to Michelle and Sandy . These lovely ladies are having a roller skating party next weekend and no offense , but fuck your wedding I 'm totally coming ack . By the way Lou rolls out a ZIPLOCK BAG full of cocaine .
JACOB: Has anyone else noticed that things around here are weird as shit ? Adam and Nick nod . Lou shakes his head .
LOU: Do n't you ruin this . If you wake me from this dream , I 'll kill you .
IGNORING LOU: What do you think happened ?
JACOB: I have no idea , but look
NICK: I 'm ruined !
LOU: We 're in 1971 .
CORRECTING HIM: We 're in 1987 . Everyone looks stunned and dazed .
JACOB: What are we gon na do ? I have plans next weekend .
ADAM: We all have plans . It 's my fucking wedding !
NICK: Now hold on , we do n't know for sure that we 're in 1987 .
ADAM: What the FUCK is going on ? ! Nick stands up and calmly takes charge .
NICK: Everyone relax . I think I know what 's happened . And when we 're done discussing it , we 're all gon na feel a lot better .
ADAM: This happens ?
NICK: Yes . And the best thing for us to do is to stay put . The universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this little glitch .
ADAM: This is a big glitch .
JACOB: Yeah , you 're an idiot . Black holes are in space . Not at a ski resort .
HOPEFUL: So does this mean we get to go to girls ' locker rooms and see them naked and they ca n't see us ?
JACOB: No , we traveled through time . We 're not invisible . Lou looks upset .
LOU: I 'm still gon na do it .
ADAM: Guys , ignoring the ridiculousness of how we got here for a moment
NICK: Black hole .
ADAM: How are we supposed to get back ?
LOU: We find a scientist .
NICK: We 're waiting for a scientist .
LOU: Where 's your white coat ?
SCIENTIST: I 'm not that kind of scientist .
LOU: This is bullshit ! I told you
ADAM: Wait a minute . Just tell him .
NICK: OK. You tell him , Adam .
ADAM: Sir , we
EMBARRASSED: This is ridiculous .
SCIENTIST: Nothing 's too ridiculous in the name of science .
JACOB: We 're from the future .
SCIENTIST: Get the fuck out of here .
ADAM: That went well . Lou starts walking off by himself .
TO LOU: Where are you going ? Lou points to his watch .
LOU: Five o'clock . Happy hour . The guys look at him , confused .
THEN: It 's Saturday . They have wet T- shirt contests on Saturdays .
ADAM: Well , maybe one drink . Just to confirm .
NICK: Holy shit . It 's that bellhop .
JACOB: Should we warn him ?
COVERS EYES: I do n't want to see this go down . Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN THE AIR and
LOU: Fuck that guy .
NICK: God bless our country .
ADAM: We 're in 1987 .
JACOB: You can stop saying that . I do n't think it 's making a difference .
ADAM: Seriously , we have to get back . We seriously have to get back !
WAITRESS: Here ya go , guys . Three Buds , one Bartles and James .
NICK: Hey , if it 's available , I 'm ordering it . I always wanted one of these when I was little .
JACOB: Can you give us a second ? She walks away , as Jacob turns to the guys .
NICK: I 've got an idea .
ADAM: I still ca n't believe it 's really her !
LOU: She 's aged remarkably well .
REMEMBERS: Oh , right . Why do n't you just go talk to her ?
ADAM: I should go talk to her . To apologize , of course . You know , nothing inappropriate .
LOU: Sure
TO ADAM: Listen putz , if you 're gon na try to attack me again , my boyfriend will e here soon . He 'll kick your ass . Adam tries to be casual .
ADAM: No , no . No ass kicking . I just wanted to say I 'm sorry about earlier . I lost control of the old skis there .
LAUGHS NERVOUSLY: Looks like I shoulda taken anothe one of your classes !
JENNIE: When did you take my class ?
ADAM: Certainly not when I was a kid ! I mean , that would make no sense ! Adam tries to recover .
JENNIE: Yeah , OK. Have a good night . Jennie starts to walk away with her friends .
TOO FRIENDLY: Hey , where ya going ?
JENNIE'S FRIEND: Are you with that guy over there ? She discretely points out Jacob .
ADAM: Yeah , he 's my brother .
JENNIE'S FRIEND: There 's a party later tonight at this address . Make sure he comes with you . He 's way boss ! Adam walks back to his friends .
JACOB: How 'd it go ? He shows them his palm .
ADAM: We got invited to a party later .
LOU: sweet ! What are we gon na do until then ?
ADAM: How about figure out how the hell to get back to the present day ?
NICK: Bam !
LOU: We 're millionaires !
NICK: Close . It 's a thousand bucks .
ADAM: Where did you get that money ? Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen .
PROUDLY: Sold them my iPod . Jacob looks incredulous .
JACOB: That was NOT a good idea !
LOU: I agree . You left so much money on the table . It 's a fucking iPod ! You could 've gotten a LOT more !
JACOB: That 's not what I
ADAM: Fellas , we are not making progress and we 're losing time .
NICK: Adam , do n't worry . Time 's not moving forward in the future .
JACOB: Uh , yeah it is . Lest we forget the lessons learned from Bill and Ted .
NICK: Well then I give you Back to the Future .
JACOB: That 's not fair . You ca n't go ight to Back to the Future .
NICK: Why not ?
JACOB: Back to the Future had a time machine .
NICK: Well so did Bill and Ted .
REALIZES: Wait , that 's it ! I ca n't believe I 'm about to say this , but I think we have a time machine .
NICK: Adam , all we did is get drunk in the hot tub . Everyone 's EYES GO WIDE .
LOU: A hot tub time machine .
ADAM: Here goes nothing !
NICK: Well , it was worth a shot .
LOU: I love this place .
ADAM: Guys , we 're running out of ideas here !
LOU: I know what we do next .
SOBERING SLIGHTLY: This will not end well .
LOU: Oh shit , they found me ! I do n't know how but they found me !
LAUGHS: I always wanted to say that . Punch it ! Jacob HITS THE GAS .
SURPRISED: This thing 's a piece of shit . Up ahead , the ROAD CURVES DRASTICALLY .
JACOB: Hey Lou ?
LOU: Yeah ?
VERY CALM: We 're doing a hundred . I ca n't control this car .
NODS: I hear ya .
ADAM: So do you think we should run away ?
LOU: I wonder if we 'll still be here fo our court appearance .
ADAM: If we 're still here in four months , I will happily go to jail , because I 'll be fucked anyway .
TOWEL GUY: Who the hell are you dweebs ? !
NICK: Jesus Christ , what the hell , Lou ? !
LOU: I have no tolerance for intruders .
NICK: This is probably his room ! We 're not registered here in 87 .
LOU: I 'm still pretty OK with it .
ADAM: You have a problem .
LOU: Just help me put him outside .
AWKWARDLY: Hey . Dudes . Our friend 's hellaciously wasted . He partied pretty hearty to the max . To the extreme max .
DUDE #1: Bodacious .
ADAM: So you guys wan na fuck with him o what ?
DUDE #2: Excellent .
NICK: Let 's just go to sleep . We 'll figure everything out in the morning . It 's pretty late . Jacob checks his watch , rolling his eyes .
JACOB: It 's 8 45 .
NICK: Why am I so wiped out ?
JACOB: Because you 're old and lame ?
LOU: Yeah , fuck that , we 're going to that party !
ADAM: We are not going to the party .
LOU: Hear me out .
ADAM: Did we go to the same school ? Lou turns and addresses Adam directly .
LOU: The point is you have n't even met your wife yet ! She ca n't fault you for shit that went down 23 years ago ! Even if 23 years ago somehow ends up being tonight !
MORE PASSIONATE: No !
CONFUSED: I do n't know .
LOU: Close enough . We 'll talk some more at the party .
ADAM: This sweater makes me look like a jerkof f .
BREATHES DEEPLY: It 's good to be home .
NICK: Was this like an 80s thing ?
LOU: If he does n't lose that arm soon , I 'm gon na take it from him myself .
TAD: Hey , glad you could make it !
ANNOYED: This is your party ?
CHAZ: Hey man , no hard feelings , all ight ? If your bro says you 're cool , then we 're cool .
TAD: There 's some people I want you to meet . By the way , bodacious hair . Incredibly chic .
FLATTERED: Oh yeah ? It does n't really take that much product . It 's all in the layering .
TAD: Whoa . Product . You 're blowing my mind right now . Did you spend time in Europe ?
CHAZ: Do n't tell me . Prague . Do you want some coke ?
JACOB: Do you have Coke Zero ?
TAD: Ah , a conscientious objector . I like that . Got ta stay sharp .
NICK: These will be ready in 15 minutes .
PARTY CHICK: So it 's like jello . With vodka .
NICK: Mmm hmm . You get drunk while you enjoy a delicious gelatin snack .
PARTY CHICK: How come no one ever thought of this before ?
NICK: Do n't know . I just invented it . Party chick looks into his eyes , dreamily .
PARTY CHICK: I appreciate you .
NICK: I love you .
JACOB: He did a bunch of drugs and went on a rant about how much he resents Ace of Base .
ADAM: That band 's from the 90s .
JACOB: I know . He made me borrow Tad 's video camera . He wants to document the performance and sue the band for infringement when we get back .
ADAM: So , you like these guys ?
JACOB: They 're rich , popular , and they shower me with compliments . They 're pretty much the best friends I 've ever had .
CROWD: Phil ! Phil ! Phil !
NICK'S CROWD: Nick ! Nick ! Nick !
PARTY GUY: This guy should be in charge of everything !
NICK: I should .
SANDY: Truth or dare ? Lou confers with Michelle before answering .
LOU: Dare .
SANDY: OK , we dare Lou to put a Twizzle up his ass . Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob .
LOU: You son of a bitch ! Have you eve played this game before ? It 's supposed to be awesome !
MICHELLE: Your turn ! Truth or dare ? Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob
SMILES: Truth .
LOU: I do n't care . Whatever . This is not the point of the game .
MICHELLE: OK , each of you has to tell you darkest , most personal secret . Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head .
JACOB: Oh wow , all right . Let me think . I 've never told anyone this , but I was afraid of scary movies until I was 18 . I even ran out of the theater a couple of times .
SANDY: Oh you poor thing ! Come here
SHY: I 'm not sure I should tell mine .
MICHELLE: Come on ! You have to !
SANDY: OK , but you ca n't laugh .
WHO CARES: We promise . Let 's hear it .
SANDY: So this one time me and my friend Lori took a train to Baltimore . It was the summer and we wanted to party , but we had no money . So Lori found this businessman who was also looking for a good time and told him that we 'd give him a half and half for seventy-five dollars . You know a suck and fuck .
GIGGLING: I 'm sorry ! Jacob and Lou look shell-shocked .
LOU: Fuck you , your turn .
JACOB: That 's the gay ear , you know . As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD
ADAM: So I lied to you earlier . I was n't here for a power tool convention .
JENNIE: I know . You do n't look like you could handle power tools .
ADAM: The truth is , Jennie , I 've always liked you . But I 've never really known you . I really was n't supposed to meet you again .
JENNIE: Who are you ? !
ADAM: I came here from the future .
JENNIE: Let me guess . You want to beam me up to your spaceship built for two ? Or maybe you 're wondering if these are astronaut pants ?
ADAM: Astronaut pants ?
JENNIE: Because my ass is out of this world ? Give me a break , spaz . I 've heard them all . She turns away . Adam goes after her .
ADAM: No ! No spaceship . No astronaut pants . Just regular time travel . With normal pants .
JENNIE: OK , what 's the punch line ?
BLAINE: I thought I told you to stay off my mountain , partner !
JENNIE: Blaine , stop !
BLAINE: You talking to my girl ? Huh ? I ca n't hear you .
JENNIE: Blaine , that 's enough ! Let him go ! He ca n't breathe !
BLAINE: Ca n't breathe ? Is that right ? Can you breathe , partner ? What 's that ? I ca n't hear you . Just tell me you ca n't breathe and I 'll stop . Adam still struggles . Blaine just shrugs .
JENNIE: Screw you , Blaine !
TO ADAM: Come on , let 's go !
SANDY: It 's from a box . There 's lots !
LOU: Mmm . Fantastic .
QUICK TURN: Do you mind if I borrow my friend ? We 'll only be a moment .
LOU: You 're gon na fuck her !
JACOB: I 'm not gon na have sex with her . She killed a guy !
LOU: That guy was undesirable . You heard her . It was about the money .
JACOB: Great , so she 's a prostitute . I 'm not sleeping with a hooker either .
LOU: She 's not a hooker . She 's a girl who did what she had to do to make a few bucks . Listen , she 's probably awesome in ed .
JACOB: She probably has a hairy vagina .
LOU: Exactly ! Jacob looks confused .
JACOB: I 'm not having this conversation . It 's pointless . I do n't have a condom .
LOU: Perfect ! Me neither ! No one here uses condoms . It 's like heaven . Only with a lot more coke .
JACOB: Like a fucking madman ? He slaps Jacob 's arms .
LOU: Rock and roll .
ADAM: Oooh , Atlantic Avenue . That 's gon na cost you .
JENNIE: How much ?
ADAM: I 'll tell ya what
JENNIE: I 'm sorry I called you those names .
ADAM: Hey , it 's cool . I was being creepy and spazzy .
JENNIE: You 're still not gon na tell me how you know me ?
ADAM: I 'm from the future .
JENNIE: Fine , let 's just drop it . I 'm glad you 're feeling better . Blaine had no right to hit you .
SMILES: I bet he 's going out of his mind ight now .
ADAM: What are you doing with a douche like him anyway ? You 're so much etter than that .
JENNIE: Yeah , well guys like you come to visit . Guys like him live here .
ADAM: So if I lived here , I 'd have a shot ?
JENNIE: I 'm gon na get going . Adam stands up with her .
SURPRISED: We did n't do anything !
SMILES: Shh . It 's our little secret . Jennie exits , leaving Adam confused .
LOU: Tab ?
JACOB: Stop talking to me !
ADAM: Jennie !
WHISPERS: What are you doing here ? !
JENNIE: I thought about what you said and you 're right . I should be with you .
ADAM: I did n't necessarily say that .
JENNIE: I want you , Adam !
ADAM: Oh my god !
LILY: So you do like her better than me ?
ADAM: No , she just
LOOKS AROUND: Jennie ?
LILY: What 's wrong with my vagina , Adam ?
ADAM: Nothing 's wrong with it . It 's eautiful .
NICK: It 's a beautiful vagina . Among the prettiest I 've ever seen .
ADAM: Stay out of it , Nick !
LILY: Would it be so bad to spend the est of your life with my vagina ?
ADAM: No . It would n't at all . Lily turns and walks out the door .
GROGGY MUMBLING: Vagina huh ?
ADAM: Who are you talking to ? Nick looks at Adam and covers the receiver .
NICK: Courtney .
ADAM: What do you mean `` Courtney ? '' Adam picks up ANOTHER PHONE .
NICK: OK , so that may have been bad .
ADAM: What were you thinking ?
LOU: Guess who re-popped his 80s cherry ? This guy !
TOWEL GUY: Hey , get the hell out of my room !
NICK: Oh , we 're going to jail .
LOU: Help me put him in the closet .
ADAM: Has anyone seen Jacob ?
LOU: He 's grabbing drinks with Tad and Chaz . Which is what we should do . We 'll start at the Brew Haus and do a three drink crawl up the street Adam gets more fed up than ever .
ADAM: Guys ! I refuse to accept that we 're stuck in 1987 ! Maybe you 're loving it , Lou . But you do n't get it . Nick 's insane , Jacob 's become a bigger douche than before , and I need to get back for my goddamn ehearsal dinner ? Which is tomorrow !
CALMLY: Adam . I know I do n't look like I understand , but I do . You have a eautiful fiancee who means more to you than anything in the world . And if you could , you 'd literally travel across time for her .
ADAM: Yes .
LOU: I get it , man . Life is about these moments . Moments where a regula Joe becomes a hero . Moments where you dig deep and find the motivation the courage the guts to do what 's right and what 's necessary . It 's moments like these
ADAM: Maybe we have to learn something ?
NICK: What do you mean ?
ADAM: You know , like Groundhog Day . We have to learn the meaning of life or some shit .
FREAKED OUT: I 've got ta stop doing cocaine and I need to go to the hospital . I just saw a fucking kitten explode .
NICK: I saw it too .
ADAM: It did n't explode . It vanished . It went back to the present .
LOU: This is the present .
ADAM: Our old present .
NICK: So it is the tub ! Lou POINTS at something .
LOU: Um
ADAM: OK. You guys know what to do .
LOU: Maybe these are n't the right kittens ?
ADAM: We 'll split up . Get as many different cats as you can . Let 's all meet back here in an hour .
LOU: You can count on me !
RICK: Yes !
LOU: Hate to tell ya , pal . Browns are gon na lose by 3 in overtime .
RICK: Eat shit and die , scumbag . I 've got ten large on this game .
LOU: Not only that , but I bet you Elway 's gon na throw a touchdown with 37 seconds left .
RICK: Fat chance , pal . Elway 's done nothing all day .
LOU: Care to make it interesting ?
RICK: Who the hell are you ? Lou thinks about the question for a moment .
LOU: Name 's Musselman . Hank Musselman . I 've got a cool name , huh ?
RICK: It 's a good name . What did you have in mind , Musselman ?
LOU: I win your wife gives me a lowjob . A classy one .
RICK: All right , buddy , fuck off .
LOU: You win you can kill me . Any way you want . Knife , gun , torch , sword I 'll even make a video exonerating you .
RICK: Yeah , right
LOU: I 'm serious . You look like a man who has everything . Except the license to kill . Care to gamble ?
RICK: 37 seconds ?
LOU: Exactly .
RICK: You have a deal .
TO CANDACE: Do n't worry , babe . This yahoo 's made a wager he ca n't possibly win .
MOUTH FULL: Look . Who am I ? I 'm your wife . Nuts in my mouth . Get it ?
TO CANDACE: I like it slow and romantic .
NICK: Oh , sorry man .
NOTICES HIM: Hey ! How 's that iPod working out for you ?
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: Oh , it 's a very nice toy .
NICK: If you like that , I 've got a phone ack at the lodge that will knock your socks off .
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: I wish I could see it . But I am on my way to a very important business meeting .
NICK: Oh yeah ? More important than Bluetooth ?
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: My associates and I are co- financing a how do you say it supermarket business .
SUSPICIOUS: You 're not going to Boston , by any chance ?
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: Yes ! Boston ! We leave tonight .
NICK: You 're gon na franchise out the Gelman 's Mom and Pop !
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: Yes ! How do you know this ?
NICK: Walk with me a minute . Let me tell you about some companies you should eally be looking into
CHAZ: You really are a gas , Jacob . Tad and I think you 're the cat 's pajamas .
JACOB: Thanks . I like you guys , too .
GEOFFREY: Gentlemen .
TAD: Geoffrey , please meet Jacob . Excuse his Jewish name . He really quite exceeds it .
GEOFFREY: Jacob , would you like some too ? He offers a pill bottle .
JACOB: What is it ?
CHAZ: Rohypnol . Geoffrey 's father is a pharmacist , but we do n't hold that against him .
JACOB: Rohypnol ?
TAD: You slip it to a chick who wo n't go to third . Give it an hour and you 'll be rounding home .
SURPRISED: This is a date rape drug .
LAUGHS: What the fuck is date rape ?
JACOB: These are roofies !
CHAZ: Roofies I like that !
TAD: Yeah , it takes the clinical name ight out of it . It sounds so fresh , chicks might even take it voluntarily !
TO JACOB: Hey , can we use that ? Jacob looks beside himself .
ADAM: I got regular cats . I figured maybe the kitten was a fluke .
NICK: Come here .
LOU: There !
ADAM: What am I looking at ? It 's some kind of stain .
LOU: Smell it .
ADAM: I 'm not smelling it .
NODS ENCOURAGINGLY: Smell the stain .
ADAM: What is that ?
NICK: Red Bull .
ADAM: So you 're telling me that Red Bull plus hot tub equals time travel ?
NODS PROUDLY: Mmm hmm . Hank Musselman 's getting the Nobel Prize .
ADAM: Who the fuck is Hank Musselman ?
NICK: There was just enough Red Bull fo the kitten . Not nearly enough fo a human . It 's a weight distribution thing .
ADAM: How did you even figure this out ?
LOU: Scientific method .
NICK: He bet me 20 dollars I would n't lick the stain .
LOU: I thought it was some guy 's jizz .
ADAM: What 's wrong with you ?
LOU: It worked , did n't it ?
NICK: Yeah , except one little problem . There 's no Red Bull in 1987 .
ADAM: Yes there is ! Come on !
CONCERNED: You ca n't be here . If Blaine sees you , he 'll snap your neck . I told him I blew you and he 's not happy .
ADAM: Why would you do that ? !
NICK: Look . Lou looks to where Nick is looking
LOU: Holy shit !
TEETH CLENCHED: where the fuck are you going ? !
YOUNG LOU: What the hell do you want , old man ?
LOU: Herschel and Evelyn are n't gon na do a damn thing . They 're losers .
YOUNG LOU: How do you know my parents ?
LOU: Listen to me . Start putting minoxidil on your scalp . Tonight . Then , when Propecia comes on the market , start taking it . Every day . Hair is important .
YOUNG LOU: I do n't give a shit about hair .
LOU: You will ! Or I 'll tell everyone about how you jerked off to that issue of Playgirl .
QUIETLY: It was confusing ! There were naked people and it had `` girl '' in the title !
LOU: Hey , you do n't have to justify to me , pal .
FREAKED OUT: Who are you ?
LOU: I 'm God .
JENNIE: Fine . You wan na see Blaine ? It 's your funeral . He 's in the warehouse at the end of Lawrence . Good luck .
LOU: Moment of truth .

JACOB: Hey guys !
ADAM: I thought you were with douche patrol .

ADAM: Ah .
NICK: Adam , where are we going ? Adam gets a look of determination again .
ADAM: To get my bag . We get that , we have the Red Bull , and our ticket home .
LOU: Yes ! The race is on !
ADAM: What race ?
LOU: Duh , it 's 1987 ? We 're at a ski esort ?
SHAKES HEAD: Disputes like these are settled with a downhill ski race . Usually at dawn . It 's the law .
ADAM: You 're an idiot .
BLAINE: Welcome to my lair .
ADAM: You live here ?
NICK: Yeah , this is kind of a shitty place to live .
BLAINE: I do n't live here .
ADAM: Look . Blaine . I think we got off on the wrong foot . You have some issue with me .
BLAINE: You get blown by my girl ? I 'll say that 's one hell of an issue .
LOU: Whoa ! You got blown ? !
ADAM: She did n't blow me . She lied to you to make you jealous . I 'm not trying to steal Jennie . I just wan na get my bag .
BLAINE: Oh , your bag . I was wondering when you 'd come around for that . Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates .
ADAM: Yeah , I 'll just take it and get out of your way .
BLAINE: You will ? Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND .
ADAM: Whattya say ? Can we work this out like gentlemen ?
NICK: What is this town 's obsession with knives ?
MENACING: How about I work this out like a utcher ?
JACOB: You guys are posers ! You 're not etter than me !
TAD: Jacob , I wish you had n't seen us like this . Adam stands near Blaine , who helps a WOMAN .
TO WOMAN: These would look so good with you light complexion .
ADAM: Listen asshole ! I want my bag !
TO WOMAN: Will you excuse me for a moment ?
LOU: See ? I told you !
TO BLAINE: I do n't wan na race you .
BLAINE: Then I guess you do n't want you ag .
SMIRKS: See you at dawn .
ADAM: Your girlfriend sucks one hell of a mean dick . Adam makes a SLURPING SOUND and Blaine fumes .
NICK: What are we gon na do ?
LOU: That chick blew you ? !
JACOB: Just stick to the plan and you 're gon na be fine . Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment .
ADAM: Jacob , I 'm sorry for not always eing the big brother I should 've een . I was away at college , Mom gave you my Sega - there were a whole host of issues . Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too .
JACOB: I know . I 'm sorry too . I put a few things before my family and took my guilt out on you . I guess it was an inevitable I 'd end up part of a roofie ring . Adam smiles and extends his hand .
ADAM: Friends ?
JACOB: Brothers . They EMBRACE . Lou looks disgusted .
LOU: Gay .
ADAM: I did n't think you guys would show .
BLAINE: This was my idea .
ADAM: It 's gon na make my victory taste all the more sweeter . Like a Peach Snapple .
BLAINE: A what ?
ADAM: You 'll see .
BLAINE: What 's that ?
ADAM: You 're not afraid of getting beat y a guy on a skateboard , are you ?
BLAINE: I 've seen you in action . You 're eckless and terrible .
ADAM: Reckless and terrible 's my middle name . Because I feel the need for speed ! Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line .
ADAM: Here goes nothing .
BLAINE: You ca n't beat me ! I was born on this mountain !
ADAM: I was born in a hospital like a normal baby !
PHIL: Ahhhh ! My arm ! ! !
LOU: Yes !
NICK: You did it , man .
ADAM: Ah , it was nothing . I just fell down the mountain .
NICK: It was a beautiful fall .
DISGUSTED: Tell me you are not going to keep eating that . Lou takes a bite and SHRUGS .
LOU: Chicken parm . It 's my favorite .
ADAM: Chicken parm ?
LAUGHS: Chicken parm . On this roll .
JACOB: Adam , what is it ?
NICK: That sandwich was special , huh ?
ADAM: You could say that . You could also say it gave me horrible diarrhea .
LOU: Keep the sandwich .
JACOB: This is disgusting .
ADAM: She gave me this as a reminder of her love .
THINKS: Or to give me horrible diarrhea so I did n't leave the room during the achelor party . But mostly as a eminder of her love . Adam holds up the sandwich .
LOU: Do you have any stories about these chips or can I eat them ?
JENNIE: There you are !
ADAM: Jennie ! What are you doing here ?
JENNIE: Making good on a rumor .
ADAM: Whoa .
JENNIE: When I saw you win that race against Blaine , everything changed for me . I realize now that I deserve more . I deserve a winner .
SEDUCTIVE: Come and get your prize .
ADAM: Yeah , I ca n't . She covers up , embarrassed .
JENNIE: Oh my god . I missed my opportunity .
ADAM: No , I 'm not sure there ever was an opportunity . Jennie , you 're terrific . You 've brought me so many moments of joy , you 'll neve know . But I should n't have given you the wrong idea .
EMOTIONAL: I would totally blow you right now .
ADAM: I know you would .
NICK: We do n't have to go yet , Adam . Things are just getting fun .
JACOB: And we can do whatever we want without any real consequences . That 's a lot to give up .
NODS: That 's how I know I 'm doing the ight thing .
JACOB: Where 's the Red Bull ?
ADAM: I do n't want Jennie .
BLAINE: That 's funny . I do n't want this soda , either .
ADAM: Nooooo !
DESPERATE: Why ? Lou takes Blaine 's pulse .
LOU: Holy shit ! You may have killed this guy ! No wait wait I 've got a pulse . Eh , so much for that . Nick puts his hand on Adam 's shoulder .
NICK: I 'm sorry man . I 'm really sorry .
ADAM: The Red Bull 's gone . He fucked us .
JACOB: Not necessarily . Everyone looks toward Jacob .
NICK: It 's worth a shot .
ADAM: Come on , Lou .
LOU: Nah , I 'll take a rain check .
NICK: What are you talking about ?
LOU: Listen , your lives at home sound all beautiful and happy with you arbecues and swimming pools and `` oh , that sandwich reminds of some gay shit I did one time . ''
THEN: No offense .
ADAM: Yeah , no , I get it . Lou goes around and gives them all hugs .
NICK: Makes perfect sense , man . Lou squeezes Jacob 's shoulder .
LOU: I do n't hate you as much as I used to .
JACOB: I hate you a little less also . Lou LIFTS BLAINE 'S LIMP BODY .
ADAM: OK , whenever you 're ready , Lou .
LOU: One small step for man ! One giant asshole puking in a hot tub ! Here goes nothing !
NICK: OK , well maybe if we
ADAM: What happened ? Did it work ?
NICK: I did n't feel anything .
NICK: Dammit . Even the deck furniture 's the same . We fucking blew it . It did n't work .
ADAM: Where 's Lou ?
NICK: Ahhh !
LOU: Oh , the face , eh ? I was curious how you 'd react .
ADAM: Lou ?
LOU: You 're damn right it 's me .
ADAM: What happened ?
LOU: You just traveled 23 years in three seconds . Took me 23 years . It 's good to see you guys !
JACOB: We 're back ? It all looks the same .
LOU: It better ! You know how much I pay the groundspeople around here ? A lot . But that 's all right , I 'm fucking loaded . Look at all this . Everyone looks confused .
ADAM: Will you fill in some of the blanks for me , please ?
LOU: I 'll give you the short version , ecause time is of the essence . First of all , to settle an old bet , time most definitely has been moving forward . It is exactly three days since you 've arrived here in beautiful Havenhurst . Jacob looks at Nick .
JACOB: Told you .
LOU: Secondly , I 'm filthy rich . Made sports bets . Sued Ace of Base . I own most of V ermont .
REMEMBERING: A horrible mistake .
ADAM: Wait , fuck , Lou what time is it ?
LOU: Way ahead of you , Adam . You have 2 hours to get to New Jersey in time for your rehearsal dinner .
LOU: Not even a little bit . I have a helicopter waiting in the parking lot and a private jet on my airfield five minutes away . The guys look stunned .
ADAM: Why would she have sex with you ?
LOU: You get the big time assist . All that talk of her finding the right guy who 's willing to give up everything ? Made her wetter than a log flume .
SMILES: She 's all-time top five .
ADAM: Good to hear .
NICK: Lou , I got ta ask you something .
LOU: Time travel paradox .
NICK: Exactly . Are n't there now two of you living here in 2010 ?
LOU: Think really hard about that one . What happened to me when I was 19 ?
NICK: No way
ADAM: You went missing and were neve found .
LOU: Yeah , you 're gon na have some lingering memories of both versions .
ADAM: Wait a minute , what happened to you know . Other Lou .
LOU: You do n't wan na know .
ADAM: Lou
LOU: The kid sucked , OK ? He could n't take even a little bit of direction . Pretty soon I realized that having two versions of the same dude walking around as cool as that sounds did n't make very much sense to me .
LOU: So I took care of the problem .
NICK: What did you do ?
LOU: I had to do it .
ADAM: What did you do ?
LOU: I killed myself .
ADAM: Jesus Christ .
LOU: Yeah , it was really some existential shit . I mean , here I am committing homicide and I 'm actually committing suicide .
NICK: How could you ?
LOU: It was easy actually . For a minute , I thought I might be dealing with that whole Timecop thing . You know , the same matte ca n't occupy the same space at the same time bullshit and we both go poof ? Especially after that whole nose thing . But no , it was just a murder . I did n't suffer .
ADAM: I do n't wan na hear any more .
LOU: It was strangulation .
ADAM: I do n't wan na hear any more ! They sit in horrified silence for a bit .
LOU: You 'll have to introduce me when we get there . Your families wo n't know me . Although I 'm sure they 're huge fans .
ABRUPT: So hey , getting married , huh ? Taking the plunge ! Adam looks disturbed . Nick looks confused .
NICK: This makes no sense at all .
LILY: Do n't you ever let me take you phone again !
COY: I 'm here on time . Just like I promised .
TEARFUL: Me too !
ADAM: You 're the one . Lily notices Adam 's on CRUTCHES .
LILY: Oh my god , what happened ?
LOU: I was partaking in a little ski adventure and I mistakenly wandered into your fiance 's path . His oken leg is my broken heart . My most humble apologies .
NICK: I was thinking we 'd invite Adam and Lily over for dinner when they get ack from their honeymoon . That 's if it 's OK with you ?
COURTNEY: Why would n't it be OK with me ? That sounds nice .
NICK: So how are your parents ?
COURTNEY: Still working hard . I really wish they could retire already , but it 's tough competing with the big chains . I mean , they just have the one store
IN JAPANESE: Hiro-san ! Cancel the paperwork ! We have to get back to Tokyo . I have inside information that undermines the supermarket deal .
SMILES: You know what they say about hard work . Builds character .
ADAM: Ahh !
JACOB: This is why we should n't have sold that iPod .
ADAM: What does that mean for us ?
JACOB: Pretty much nothing for us personally . We just get coole phones and iPods and shit .
ADAM: Oh . Great !
LILY: I know you were only gone for a couple days , but I missed you so much . Adam takes her hand .
ADAM: Come on , let 's get out of here . We have unfinished business . Lily smiles . She gets into it .
LILY: It 's about time . OK , what 's the fantasy ?
GENUINE: How about you 're the woman I love and I 'm the man of your dreams ?
LILY: Booor-ing ! !
ADAM: OK , you 're a nurse and a snake bit my penis .
LILY: Done and done . They bolt for the door and we
LOU: So you 're friends with the bride ?
BEAUTIFUL GIRL: Can you keep a secret ? I 'm actually kinda crashing the party .
LOU: Naughty girl . You 're secret 's safe with me .
BEAUTIFUL GIRL: I 'm just in town for a couple of nights . I 'm actually looking fo my father . We 've never met .
LOU: I 'm from here . Maybe I know him .
BEAUTIFUL GIRL: His name is Hank Musselman .

PAUL: You are with me , Zozo , do n't worry . Zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off .
ZOZO: What is it like to fly on a plane , sir ?
PAUL: It depends where you sit Zozo . In coach it is like the bus to Giterama .
ZOZO: That is why they call it coach ?
PAUL: Maybe . But in business class there are fine wines , linens , Belgian chocolates .
ZOZO: You have taken business class ?
PAUL: Many times .
ZOZO: There is nowhere to turn , sir . As the van approaches ,
PAUL: Slow down .
GEORGE: You will join us at the rally today ?
PAUL: I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics .
GEORGE: Politics is power , Paul . And money .
PAUL: Time is money , George . We need extra bee today .
GEORGE: Business is good at the hotel ?
PAUL: Very good .

US AMBASSADOR: Thank you for a wonderful meal , Paul .
GREGOIRE: Come on , Zozo , cockroaches can jump , some of them can fly .
PAUL: No . You pick it up .
BIK: That 's what I came to talk to you about .
PAUL: Excuse me ?
BIK: The Hutu-Tutsi thing . The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth fo the peace accords . And the U.N. wants the anquet room for that day , a reception to oadcast the signing ceremony . Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish ?
PAUL: Leave it to me .
BIK: Also , could you remember to use the service entrance at all times ?

TATIANA: I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais . She has a rash .
PAUL: Your brother 's here ?

ROGER: For food and clothes , and all that grows , etc , etc . Dear Lord , thank you .
PAUL: Thank you , Roger .
ROGER: Simon has a new pet . Can I go see it ?
PAUL: No , I do n't want you going on the street .
OGER: Please , papa , I have a secret path .

TATIANA: Simon , next door , the Charingas ' boy .
PAUL: Homework ?
ROGER: It 's done .
TATIANA: And he did extra chores .
PAUL: Wash your things , and be back soon .
ROGER: Let 's feed it .
THOMAS: I 've heard bad things , Paul . My assistant says we should get out of Rwanda .
FEDENS: Why should we leave ? I have a new job , things have never been better for us .
THOMAS: What good is it if we are murdered in ou ed ?
TATIANA: Your assistant , he is Hutu ?
THOMAS: Yes , and he is in the Hutu Power Militia .
CARINE: He wants your job .
THOMAS: No , he is a friend , but he tells me to listen to the radio . All day they talk about the great slaughter .
TATIANA: That station is filth .
PAUL: Today I talked to my friend the American Ambassador and Colonel Oliver of the United Nations . They are preparing a anquet for the peace signing . The BBC are flying in their best reporters . The world is watching . There will be peace . Do n't listen to this man .
ROGER: There are soldiers .
PAUL: Where ?
ROGER: On the street .
TATIANA: What is it ?
PAUL: What ?
TATIANA: Call your friends in the army . Call someone . Victor is harmless . This is a mistake .
PAUL: Please , be quiet .
TATIANA: I 'm going to talk to them .
PAUL: No .
TATIANA: We must do something .
PAUL: What would you have us do ? Argue with these madmen ? We can not interfere .
TATIANA: I 'll fix a bed .
PAUL: I could n't help .
TATIANA: You could have asked for a favor .
PAUL: No , I could not . What do you know about favors Tatiana , about barter and deals ? All day long I work to please this officer , that diplomat , this tourist . To store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help I have powerful people I can call upon . Now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger .
TATIANA: Victor was not a stranger , he was ou neighbor .
PAUL: He was not family . Family is all that matters . Do you think if you or I were eing dragged from here , any one of them would lift a finger to help us ?
TATIANA: They do not have your connections .
PAUL: Connections ? I have no connections , only favors . If I call to help Victor , a General will think `` Paul Rusesabagina is a fool . He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody . '' Then my hard work is doubly squandered . I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all . Please leave these things to my good judgment .
GLORIA: We reserved five rooms not two

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Nonsense . At this moment we are making plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into our armed forces .
GLORIA: Then the army fully supports the president as he signs the peace agreement .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Of course , the president is a clever man , he knows what he is doing . Thank you fo coming to Rwanda . . You will see what a beautiful country this is .
PAUL: Forgive the hurry but I do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake . It is the most spectacular sight in all Africa .
OB: Lunch ? All we do is eat . I thought there was famine in Africa .
PAUL: Exactly , we ca n't have our guests starving . What would they think of the Mille Collines back in the United States ?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Keep that cockroach Benedict away from me .

JOCK: Can we phone them in , Paul ?
PAUL: I 'm afraid I ca n't do that , Mr. Daglish . Ah , Zozo .
JOCK: Zozo ! The very man !

FEDENS: Please , let us take Tatiana with us . You are Hutu , you will be safe .
PAUL: Thomas , Fedens , I am a man who looks after his family . If there were danger I would be the first to leave ?
FEDENS: What was that ?
PAUL: Calm yourself , it is fireworks to celebrate the peace .

PAUL: Nonsense . Why would the rebels kill the president when he agreed to peace ?
TATIANA: Where are Thomas and Fedens ?
PAUL: I sent them home . Go and call them .
TATIANA: I tried already . The phones do not work .
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Our great president is murdered , by the Tutsi cockroaches . They tricked him , then they killed him . We must cleanse this country , Good Hutus of Rwanda . We must clear the brush . Clear the brush of all cockroaches . Clear the brush ! ! !
PAUL: Come on , everyone out of this room , find a seat in the living room .
TATIANA: They came through the bushes , over the wall . What could I do ?
PAUL: Send them home . We are not the police . What do we have to protect them ?
TATIANA: Please . Let them stay 'til morning . The militia will not come here , they know you are a Hutu with influence .
PAUL: They know you are Tutsi !
TATIANA: Please , Paul , 'til first light .
PAUL: Dawn . Then they go .
ODETTE: Forgive me , Paul . Danielle says that Roger has gone .

PAUL: They are gone . Thank you , sir . What did you do ?
SABENA PRESIDENT: I managed to get the President of France on the phone .
PAUL: Why ?
SABENA PRESIDENT: I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them French , British , Americans .
PAUL: There will be no rescue , no intervention force . We can only save ourselves . Call any foreigner you know , tell them what will happen to us . Say goodbye but when you say goodbye , say it as though you 're eaching through and shaking their hand . Let them know if they let go of that hand , you will die . We must shame them into sending help .

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: What did they say ?
PAUL: The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Watch everything ? How ? They are gone .
PAUL: Satellites .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Satellites ?
PAUL: Yes , they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder .
ENERAL BIZIMUNGU: And what will they do with these satellites ?
PAUL: The American said intervention is too costly , better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The high command ? Our high command ?
PAUL: 'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial . Lock them all away forever . No political risk , and big publicity . ' That 's what he said . I thought I 'd better tell you .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The Americans ! Who are they to put us on trial . Let us imagine Paul when thei president Kennedy was shot , they said it was a black man . Then their politicians , their radio stations gave orders ` we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us . ' What do you think would have happened ? No different .
PAUL: Where has all our beer gone ?
ZOZO: Sir , Gregoire has been taking beers .
PAUL: How much beer ?
ZOZO: Many beers .
PAUL: I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel . Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The police are very busy .
PAUL: I understand General , but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be ewarded .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: He did .
PAUL: `` Well rewarded '' Those were his words .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: If I were to spare a few policemen , where would I station them ?
PAUL: The front gate would be best , General . They could check all guests .
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I will see what I can do .
PAUL: I admire you , General . How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness ?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I am strong , Paul , like a lion .
PAUL: I wish I were like you . Look at my staff , they wo n't work , they listen to no one .
ENERAL BIZIMUNGU: He is staff ?
BENEDICT: Paul , we would like to speak to you in your office .
PAUL: We , who is we ?
BENEDICT: A delegation .
PAUL: Yes .
BANKER: You have no right to charge us rent .
PAUL: Why not ?
BANKER: This is no longer a hotel , it is a prison and you are profiteering from our misery .
ODETTE: That is not true .

PAUL: I confess . It 's true I have a deal with General Bizimungu . He was just here . I worked out another money making scheme for him . New arrivals will be taxed at the gate .
JEAN BAPTISTE: You ca n't go to that place , they know what you are doing here .
PAUL: George will not hurt me , I am too profitable to him .
ODETTE: What if he is not there ?
PAUL: As soon as the General left he came unning back . Help me , sir , I have been possessed by a witch . A witch you say ? Yes , yes , I did not know I was in that room . The president 's room , why would I be in the president 's room ? Indeed , the General asked me the same . Asked you what ? Does Gregoire think he is president now ?
TATIANA: Stop , stop , we will waken the children .
PAUL: Lynch Bages , 84 . Perfect with lamb , o fine rare beef .
TATIANA: So where is the lamb ?
PAUL: Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it .
TATIANA: What 's the matter ?
PAUL: We 're running out of beer and othe supplies .
TATIANA: The foreigners abandon us and you do inventory . You are so conscientious .
PAUL: I have to go out to get food .
TATIANA: Go out ! Where ?
PAUL: To Rutagunda 's place . It is close by .
TATIANA: No , no .
PAUL: I have to , Tatiana , we are only as valuable as the service we provide .
TATIANA: You can not go alone .
PAUL: I 'm not going alone . I 'll take Gregoire with me . He 's a good Hutu , and he wants to impress me now .
GREGOIRE: Please , except my humblest apologies
PAUL: Do n't worry . I have a job this morning . I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda . You know George ?
GREGOIRE: Where are we going , sir ?

PAUL: ) You can not kill them all .
PAUL: Let 's go .
GEORGE: Take the river road back . It is clear .
PAUL: Are you sure this is the river road ?
GREGOIRE: I saw the sign .
PAUL: Stop . You 've driven off the road . You 'll put us in the river .
PAUL: That 's a big one . Here we go .
CHILDREN: Good evening , Papa .
PAUL: Roger , you have no greeting for me .

PAUL: It 's alright . This is the only place I can find some peace .
TATIANA: I hear we must pay fo everything . How much for this ?
PAUL: A kiss .
TATIANA: You are a very good man , Paul Rusesabagina .
PAUL: I have a confession . When we met
TATIANA: In Ruhengeri ?

MARY: The animals have got nothing to do with it .
BILL: Hey , he moved .
MARY: Let 's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something .
JERRY: That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions .
BILL: Oh yeah , I heard about that . I always thought it was bullshit .
JERRY: No yeah , they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car . The wife is screaming , the kids are crying . Some dude in another ca filmed the whole thing .
BABY: I 'd like to see that .
MARY: Nice .
JERRY: The lions were totally covered in this guy 's blood I think they ate his face off , tore open his rib cage , pulled his legs off it was a wild scene .
BABY: Things like that get a lot bloodie than ya think . Without warning the car lunges to one side .
JERRY: What was that ?
BILL: Fuck . I think we blew a tire .
MARY: Do n't even say it .
DENISE: You got to be fucking joking .

JERRY: I 'll help ya .
BILL: Gee , ya think it would n't be too much trouble .
JERRY: Yeah , I fixed it . Well , I ai n't um , I ca n't remember . I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back .
BILL: Jesus Christ , Jerry .
JERRY: Well , technically I did what ya said .
BILL: You 're a real fucking piece of work . Bill stares at Jerry in disbelief .
MARY: Can I help you with something ?
BABY: I was just wondering .
MARY: Wondering what ?
BABY: Are you two gals all funny with each other ?
MARY: What ?
BABY: You know a couple of queers .
MARY: Do you believe this fucking girl ?
BABY: I was just wondering , cause you got a pissy look about you like a eal pussy licking bitch . Denise tries to QUICKLY defuse the situation .
DENISE: No . No pussy licking here , but thanks for your concern . Bill and Jerry slide back into the car .
BILL: Well , I got some bad news and some ad news .
MARY: What ?
JERRY: Tire 's fucking gone crap on us , man . There 's no saving it now .
BILL: And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry 's garage .
DENISE: For fucking sake Jerry , what the fuck are we gon na do ? Baby starts laughing .
MARY: What the hell are you laughing about ?
BABY: I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV .
MARY: Oh , wonderful . Fucking psycho .
BILL: I guess I 'll try to back it out on the rim at least to the main road .
BABY: If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate it 's easier .
MARY: Just back up .
JERRY: I think we should go straight . I mean we know for a fact there ai n't nothing back that way , right ?
BABY: Oh wait ! I love this song !
BILL: Fine . I 'll go straight .
MARY: What !
BILL: Fine ! I 'll go straight !
DENISE: Turn that fucking radio off ! Bill shuts off the radio .
BABY: We can walk to my house from here . My brother 's got a tow truck , he can come get your car . A silence falls over the car .

BILL: Do n't worry , I 'll be right back .
BABY: Come on .
JERRY: Do n't forget the flashlight , it 's pretty dark out there .
BILL: Thanks .
JERRY: No problem . Bill kisses Mary good-bye and EXITS .
MISS BUNNY: Hi , I 'm Miss Bunny and welcome to my Hollywood Revue where the stars shine forever .
HUMPHREY CAT: If that plane leaves the ground and you 're not with him you 'll regret it maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life .

HUMPHREY CAT: We 'll always have Paris . We did n't have , we lost it until you came to Casablanca . We got it back last night .
INGRID SQUIRREL: When I said I would never leave you .
HUMPHREY CAT: And you never will .
BILL: How much further ?
BABY: Almost there are you in a hurry or something ?
BILL: Well , yeah , kind of .
DENISE: Fuck , it 's freezing .
JERRY: Hey , listen to this I think this is related to our Dr. Satan .
DENISE: Oh , yeah .
JERRY: Yeah , in this book there 's a chapte called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show . It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that , but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder .
DENISE: Yeah , so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree ?
JERRY: It says , `` records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings , until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility . ''
DENISE: So .
JERRY: Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16 .
DENISE: Why ?
JERRY: Blah , blah , blah it does n't say , ut she was released sometime in 1937 , only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan , the arm-less wonder . Says she , `` criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946 . ''
DENISE: Yeah ?
JERRY: These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin . I 'll bet he amputated her arms .
DENISE: So what ?
JERRY: I do n't know , I just thought it was interesting .
DENISE: You know what Jerry , who really cares at this point ?
JERRY: I do n't I just thought it was weird .
MARY: God damn it , I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch .
JERRY: Huh ?
MARY: That stupid hillbilly slut .
JERRY: Oh , do n't blow everything out of proportion .
MARY: You did n't see the look she threw me . She 's up to something .
DENISE: Yeah , Jerry , she said some pretty fucked shit to us .
JERRY: When ?
DENISE: When you were outside with Bill .
MARY: She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that .
DENISE: Yeah , she said we looked queer .
JERRY: Aw , get over it , she 's just some dopey redneck , she ai n't smart enough to be up to nothing I mean anything chicks .
BABY: These are all my dolls . I use to like to chop their heads off .
BILL: OK .
BABY: Aw , you ai n't seen nothing yet .
BILL: Is your brother ready to go ?
BABY: Oh yeah , he already left . We 'll wait inside , come on .
BILL: He left !

DENISE: What happened ? Oh , I 'm sorry , it 's none of my business .
MOTHER: He tried to burn the house down , said it was possessed by the spirits . Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started . I do n't think Earl ever meant to harm us but Tiny was badly burnt , his ears were destroyed and most of his skin .
BILL: Is that why he wears the mask ?
MOTHER: Yeah , my baby boy gets shy around new people , but he 'll warm up to ya especially the ladies .
JERRY: Great . I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in .
MOTHER: Maybe . He 's a real lady killer .
JERRY: Did n't ya think , Mary ?
MOTHER: Well , we 'll see the night is young and so are you oh well , couple more minutes . Mother returns to the kitchen .

NAISH: You sure this guy 's supposed to ride with us ? Seems kind of weird .
WYDELL: Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house . Guy 's an ex-cop , thinks he can help .
NAISH: Sounds like a bad idea to me , probally just get in the way .
WYDELL: Yeah , well I guess it 's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when you own kid 's missing besides , ai n't no such thing as an ex-cop .
NAISH: I guess not .
WYDELL: That must be him .
MR. WILLIS: Yes , sir .
WYDELL: I 'm Wydell this is Naish . Wydell extends his hand , they shake hands .
NAISH: Hey .
MR. WILLIS: George Willis any leads ?
WYDELL: Well , we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town closest thing we got to a lead at this point .
MR. WILLIS: That 's it ?
WYDELL: Well , all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this characte everybody calls Dr. Satan .
MR. WILLIS: Dr. Satan ?
NAISH: Yeah it 's horseshit , just some oogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with .
WYDELL: Anyway , there 's not much else out that way so , I figure maybe there 's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms .
MR. WILLIS: What about the body you found ?
WYDELL: Oh , yeah , you know about that ? Hmmm , that 's a strange one .
NAISH: Local girl , Karen Murphy , been missing for a couple months , figured for a unaway .
MR. WILLIS: Fit the profile ?
NAISH: No , not really . Good kid , never been in any trouble .
WYDELL: Her part in this I ca n't figure ut I will .
MR. WILLIS: Christ , you know it 's crazy I lived through so many other people 's nightmares , you know . Always cool and calm , but but I never thought I 'd be the one needing help , ya know ?
NAISH: Do n't worry , we 'll find her .

NAISH: No they could n't , somebody had to see something .
MR. WILLIS: My Denise is a smart girl , she would n't do anything stupid , and he oyfriend , he always seemed like a good kid .
WYDELL: I 'm sure there 's a logical explanation .
MR. WILLIS: I pray to God there is .
NAISH: Turn up this road .
MR. WILLIS: Where we headed ?
WYDELL: I seem to remember another farm set way back off the road where the ca was found . I 'm not sure if anyone lives there anymore , but it 's worth a look .

CLAYTON HARDING: Which brings us to the subject of your sense of humour . I had a look through your `` magazine '' here .
SIDNEY: What 'd you think ?
CLAYTON HARDING: Oh , I thought it waskinda snarky . And bitter . And witless .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ( glancing at Sidney 's
CLOTHES: Well , Sidney . We 've only just met ut already I perceive I am in the presence of a rare comic sensibility .
SIDNEY: Thanks .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: I know your Hi-jinx gave you a certain notoriety back in Olde England but things are going to e a bit different here . Harding wants me to be your Rabbi , show you the ropes . Are you aware of what we do at I Spy ?
SIDNEY: You photograph famous people when they 're drunk ?
IGNORING HIM: I Spy is the nation 's window onto High Society . The Looky-Loos read us becausewell , They Were n't There . The Glitterati read us ecause we tell them They Were There . For this system to work we have to know where There is .
SIDNEY: Sowhen we go out to clubs and thingswould that , would that e on expenses or ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: This is n't a vacation . It 's a vocation .
SIDNEY: Okay . What do you mean by suitable ? Maddox gestures at Sidney 's body .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Something that covers all of this up .
SIDNEY: Is that Mussolini ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: ) No , Sidney , that 's Richard Heywood . The owner of this magazine .
SIDNEY: Oh . Looks a little like , uh Who 's this funny looking kid ? Is that his son ? Maddox stares at him .

LAWRENCE MADDOX: Miss Olsen here takes care of the gallery openings , book launches and other intellectual fare . Can you find our new rookie something to do ?

SIDNEY: Listen , seeing as how I 'm going to be sitting just over there , do n't you think we should try and put last night behind us ?
ALISON: No . Get off my desk .

ALISON: This is Clark Baxter . He 's English .
INGRID: Ohhright .
SIDNEY: Actually it 's Sidney . Sidney Young . Clark Baxter is my alias .
INGRID: Why do you have an alias ?
ALISON: He uses it when he 's trying to pick up transsexuals .
CREEPED OUT: Nice to meet you . She walks on .
TO ALISON: I take it you knew about Bob and did n't tell me ?
SIDNEY: Hello , is that the Parsons Gallery ?
OVER PHONE: All right .
SIDNEY: Thanks . SoChris Blick . Man o woman ?
BEAT: Are you sure you 're calling from Sharps magazine ?
SIDNEY: Yes , I am .
ICY: Tell me Stanley , why have they given you this assignment if you do n't know who one of the most famous artists in America is ?
SIDNEY: II do n't really know .
SNAPPING: He 's a man .
SIDNEY: Okay . Is he an old man ?
BEAT: He 's an older man , yes .
SIDNEY: ( staring at a
PHOTOGRAPH: Okay , I 've got two old men here - so is he the fat one ?
BEAT: You do realize that Clayton Harding is a personal friend of mine ?
BEAT: What 's that got to do with anything ?
SIDNEY: Is he the one with the wonky eye ?
SIDNEY: It 's fashion sensitive . If you 're not wearing Prada it 'll take you arm clean off .
ANNA: But I am wearing Prada .
MOUTH FULL: This is n't what I expected . Alison recoils slightly .
ALISON: What did you expect ?
SIDNEY: I do n't know . The Algonquin circle . Dorothy Parker . Martinis . Quips . Look at them . Not one of them is drunk .
ALISON: It 's called being a professional . You should try it some time .
SIDNEY: There 's something you should understand . I 'm not really one of you .
ALISON: By `` you '' do you mean `` human ? ''
SIDNEY: I mean the glossy posse . Bunch of Zombies , writing about `` Pets of the Stars '' but acting like they 're working for the UN . I 'm here to shake things up a bit . Where are you from ?
ALISON: Not that it 's any of you usiness , but I 'm from Port Huron , Michigan .
SIDNEY: Right . Small town girl . I bet you could only dream of getting out . Getting anywhere - yes , Clarice ? Getting all the way - to the NYC . Take my advice , do n't go taking this celebrity fluff seriously . For a moment Alison is speechless with anger .
ALISON: Youyouarrogant
HISSING: Are you insane ? That was Lawrence 's wife , Elizabeth ! He father owns Sharps !
SIDNEY: That was her ? The Mussolini baby ? He stops .
ALISON: No ! Listen to me - you do NOT approach Elizabeth Maddox , you do NOT talk to her ! Do n't even make eye-contact with her ? Do you understand ?
SIDNEY: Am I supposed to be afraid ?
ALISON: Yes .
SIDNEY: I do n't know the meaning of the word fear .
ALISON: I 'm sure there are many words you do n't know the meaning of ! She walks on , shaking her head in disbelief .
FOLLOWING HER: Snipe Magazine .
ALISON: What ?
SIDNEY: When Clayton left college he started this little magazine called Snipe . Fantastic . Took aim at every self-important celebrity in town . Completely fearless . It was like my magazine but twenty years earlier .
SARCASTIC: His glory days ? Sharps has won fourteen National Magazine awards and increased its advertising pages by more than 60 percent since he took over . He 's paid millions of dollars a year . He lives in a Bank Street townhouse , and weekends in the Hamptons . Clayton Harding is one of the lynchpins of the media-industrial complex .
SIDNEY: Yeah , but do n't worry . I think I might still be in time to save him .
MOUTH FULL: There 's a couple of hundred grands worth of food here and I swear I 'm the only person eating it . You want some ?
ALISON: Wall to wall what ?
SIDNEY: Totty . Babes . Sexually attractive women .
ALISON: Do you mind ?
SIDNEY: What ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Well , now you 're one of the High Priests of what 's Hot and what 's Not . So what were you two talking about ?
ALISON: Sidney was just marvelling at the abundance of `` Totty '' here .
ENJOYING THIS: Uh-oh . I do n't think Miss Olsen approves of you , Sidney .
SIDNEY: I should n't be here . I get thrown out of places like this .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: This ? This is a McDonald 's . I hate disease parties . Fund- aisers .
WOMAN: Lawrence Maddox ? Oh my goodness Long time . Maddox examines her coolly .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Rachel . How are you ?
RACHEL: Well , I 'm just wonderful . Wonderful . How are you ?
SMOOTHLY: Angelo , good to see you .
TO MADDOX: You know that was Rachel Petkoff ? She 's a fantastic actress . Has n't done anything for years , but , in her day
COOLLY: I 'm sure .
SIDNEY: Seriously , I 've heard about that film . I think she 's going to make a come back . We should get there first , do a profile or something efore everyone else
FAWNING: Vincent ! Great to see you . Children , I 'd like to introduce you to Vincent Lepak , enfant terrible and in , my opinion , the most exciting new director in American cinema . Vincent nods , frowning , looks around .
VINCENT: I think this is the worst fundraiser I 've been to in my whole life .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: It 's a rat fuck , is n't it ? Sidney walks away .
SIDNEY: Excuse me ? Are n't you Rachel Petkoff ? Rachel turns to look at him .
HARD: Is that so ?
SIDNEY: Absolutely . I must have seen everything you 've been in . Those episodes of The Love Boat and the Bionic Woman ? The Song Birds , In The NightI 've even seen you first ever TV appearance . The Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors . Right ?
THROWN: Right
SIDNEY: My all time favorite ? A Day Too Long . You were eally great in that .
LAUGHING: What 's your name , honey ?
SIDNEY: Sidney Young .
WRITING: Sidney Young . I 'll remember that .
VINCENT: You look around and it 's all shit . No-one is making movies that are fucking worthwhile .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: I 'd have to disagree with you , Vincent . Vincent looks at him , displeased .
VINCENT: This is what I 'm saying . You have to inspire yourself . I am my role- model . I want to be me
SUDDENLY: Greatest film ever made ?
VINCENT: Excuse me ?
SIDNEY: What 's the greatest film eve made ? Go on . Have a guess .
IRRITATED: Well , that'sI do n't think there is one single film that
SIDNEY: Have a guess .
SNEERING: Yeah , have a guess - what is the greatest film ever made ?
EMBARRASSED: I do n't , uhwell personally I love La Dolce Vita but
SIDNEY: Incorrect . Con Air .
BEAT: I beg your pardon ?
SIDNEY: Uhuh , Con Air . It 's got everything . Malkovich for you acting chops , Nicky Cage fo action , Buscemi for comedy , John Cusack for the Gays . It 's a smorgasbord .
WOMAN: I do n't think we 've been introduced ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Mister Young , this is Eleano Johnson , Queen of New York . Eleanor this is Sidney Young . He 's from England and he 's ou very own Idiot Savant . Without the Savant .
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Well , it 's always nice to have fresh blood at these things . Which reminds me , I 'm here with Sophie Maes , I want you to meet her . New film , The Suffragette coming out , the buzz is A-mazing . The release is tied in with the roll-out of the Reebok campaign , and now Louis Vuitton 's on the line . This train is leaving the station Lawrence .
TO ELEANOR: So , you 're a publicist ?
ELEANOR JOHNSON: I do n't really like that word , Sidney .
SIDNEY: What should I call you ?
ELEANOR JOHNSON: You can call me Eleanor . She stares past him , across the pool .
MURMURING: Oh , this one will go far .
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Where 's the car ? What 's it doing at the back ? Forget what I said . I want the car at the front . Now .
SOPHIE MAES: I just think it 's terrible the way we 're still exploiting animals . That 's why , you know , I wo n't wear fur or leather , I wo n't wear make-up , I 'm vegetarian .
SIDNEY: I 'm with you
SOPHIE: I 'm sorry , I ca n't understand your accent ?
EMBARRASSED: Nothing , just , uhSo you 're an actress ? Have I seen you in anything ?
SOPHIE MAES: I do n't know . Have you ?
BEAT: No . So you have n't won any Oscars yet ?
SOPHIE MAES: No .
SIDNEY: Because I would certainly vote for you for best supporting dress ! Huh , huh , huh .
UNDERSTAND HIM: I have n't been nominated fo anything .
SIDNEY: No , I 'm justI 'm saying you look
TO SOPHIE: Are you ready dear ?
TO ALISON: We 're going on to the Circle Club . I 'll see you tomorrow .
TIGHT: Okay . Good night .
SOPHIE: Are n't you cold ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: I 'm from Canada , land of ice and snow .
SIDNEY: Budge up .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Where are you going ?
SIDNEY: I 'm coming to the club .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Sorry , you 're not on the list .
FUMING: That 's that turns my stomach . Pawing her like that . He 's old enough to be her father .
IRRITATED: No he is n't .
SIDNEY: Yes he is . I started producing sperm when I was thirteen , so you know , technically
ALISON: For your information he was n't pawing her ! He was just doing his job ! In case you have n't noticed Sharps has to have a star on the cover every month . And most of those stars are clients of Eleanor 's . So do not piss he off .
SIDNEY: She 's a flak . Hacks do n't take orders from flaks . And I do n't think you can call that `` doing his job . '' The man had no blood left in his upper body
SNAPPING: Will you ? Oh , and next time you want to do the hilariously ironic I love Con Air skit would you mind ?
SIDNEY: I was n't being ironic
ALISON: would you mind not involving me , especially in the presence of Vincent Lepak who happens to be very important .
SIDNEY: Yeah , I could tell by the way he was allowed to stay up past his ed time .
ALISON: Who ?
SIDNEY: Sophie Maes . You think she 'll go out with me ?
ALISON: No . Girls like Sophie do n't date journalists . As far as she 's concerned , you 're the help .
SIDNEY: What do you know ? A lot of these starlets are lonely . They spend their time looking for a man . Alison starts to walk away .
ALISON: This is New York , Sidney . Women only date men who are successful
SIDNEY: I 'm going to be successful .
ALISON: and tall .
SIDNEY: Have you seen this ? She 's everywhere .
ASSISTANT: From Sophie Maes .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: `` Thanks for a great night . '' What a sweet kid . Oh , Sidney , about last night - word of advice . Do n't talk to the celebrities , okay ? Sophie said you made he feel uncomfortable .
CLAYTON HARDING: Good work Lawrence . Okay , well , if that 's it for He starts to get up .
SIDNEY: So , I was thinking , Clay
CLAYTON HARDING: That 's first room stuff , Sidney . And call me Clay one more time and see what happens .
VICKY: No , I 'd love these but I 'm so fat I could n't
INGRID: Get out of here !
ANNA: You look totally rexy .

ALISON: Alison .
INGRID: Tell Vicky she looks rexy .
ALISON: Rexy ?
INGRID: Anorexic .
TO VICKY: Wellyou do look like you could do with a few more pounds .
VICKY: Oh god , that 's so sweet .
TO ALISON: By the way , post-shoot clear out . Got some Gucci pants here that are way too big for us . You wan na try ?
ALISON: No , thanks .
SIDNEY: Listen , you know how things work around here . How am I going to get something in the magazine ? Alison stares at him .
ALISON: I thought all this `` fluff '' was eneath you ?
SIDNEY: It is butthings have changed .
ALISON: What 's changed ?
SIDNEY: Look , I know people think I 'm a it of an idiot and maybe I have n't started off too well here , but I wantI want
ALISON: You 're loathsome , you know that ?
OBLIVIOUS: I know he 's got a head start on me but I 'm going to win her back . Once I get my hooks into a girl , they never get free .
ALISON: Like ring-worm .
TO HIMSELF: The gloves are coming off .
SIDNEY: Okay . Celebrity Trash Cans . The contents of celebrity trash cans are revealed and readers have got ta guess who the trash belongs to Five bottles of Jack Daniels , a court order , and a copy of Mein Kampf ? Mel Gibson !
CLAYTON HARDING: First Room , Sidney . First room .
SIDNEY: Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood ?
MODEL: Morgan Freeman ?
SIDNEY: No , notwhy 's everyone say ? There ! In the head-lock !
CLAYTON HARDING: If I give you an interview will ya leave me the fuck alone ? Sidney smiles . The song ends .
NATHAN LANE: Nathan Lane . Nice to meet you .
SIDNEY: Great to meet you Nathan . I 'm a ig fan . I love that rat thing you played in The Lion King .
PLEASANTLY: Actually he 's a meer cat .
SIDNEY: ( absently , checking his
NOTES: Uhuh Now , I 've been doing some esearch and I think you 're probably quite a private man . Am I right ?
NATHAN LANE: Well
SIDNEY: Which is fine , but today , I think it would be great to get behind the mask .
BEAT: Uh , I do n't think there really is a mask as such , and I do n't wan na e a pain , but what I really wan na talk about is the new play , keep it about the work , you know ? Is that okay ?
SIDNEY: Absolutely . Of course . So , first question - are you Jewish ? Nathan stares at Sidney .
NATHAN LANE: I do n't see what the relevance of that is .
SIDNEY: Okay . Next question . The rat thing - that 's got ta be Disney 's first gay animal , right ? So , I was wondering - are you a homosexual ? Beat . Nathan looks like he might hit Sidney .
CLAYTON HARDING: What did I say to you ?
SIDNEY: What ?
CLAYTON HARDING: What did I say to you ?
SIDNEY: I just
CLAYTON HARDING: What did I say to you ?
SIDNEY: Do n't upset anyone .
CLAYTON HARDING: Do n't upset anyone .
SIDNEY: I was just trying toprobe .
CLAYTON HARDING: You wan na probe become a proctologist , okay ? You ca n't ask musical comedy stars whethe they 're Jewish or gay . From now on just assume they 're all Jewish and all gay , okay ?
SIDNEY: I 'd like to apply for an American Express card please ? Hon . Sidney Young . As in Honourable . H-O-N . It 's a British title .
WALKING OVER: Hey ! Cuba !
TO LAWRENCE: He likes you .
SMILING SMOOTHLY: Well , I 'm one of the Friends Of Cuba .
SOPHIE: No , do n't ! It 's so embarrassing ! That picture 's everywhere now . And I had no idea the dress was so see-through ! And people are talking like it was some kind of stunt .
SMOOTHLY: Such a cynical age . Hello Sidney .
SIDNEY: Hello ! Did n't , did n't know you were coming in ?
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Lawrence is taking us to lunch at Cipriani .
JEALOUS: Oh great . That 's great .
SOPHIE MAES: Lawrence ? Could I leave Cuba here ? He does n't like Italian food .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Of course you can . He can stay in my office . Sidney ? Fetch Cuba a owl of water , will you ? Sidney stares at him .
SIDNEY: Of course .
ELEANOR JOHNSON: That is a lovely ring . Where is that from ?
EMBARRASSED: It was my mother 's . She gave it to me .
SMILING: Oh , you Sweetie . That is very , very So , listenYou 've met Vincent Lepak have n't you , Sidney ?
SIDNEY: Uhuh .
ELEANOR JOHNSON: He has a new movie coming out soon and Lawrence is over- stretched as it is . How would you like to write a story on him ? Alison , at the photocopier nearby , listens . Sidney smiles , filled with hope .
SIDNEY: A story ? Absolutely . That wouldI 'd love to
SOFTLY: Well , great . Maybe we could get together and discuss the angle ?
SIDNEY: Okay . What do you mean ?
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Well , I 'd need to know how we 're going to present Vincent , check the story , so on .
BEAT: You want copy approval ?
SMILING: Any stories written about my clients need to be in their best interest , that 's all . If things work out with Vincent we could maybe talk about a follow up story on Sophie ? What do you think ?
RELUCTANTLY: I 'm sorry , Eleanor , I don'tI do n't work that way .
AMUSED: Sidney dear , think of it like this you write about one of my clients , you are borrowing some of their `` star-light '' to help sell your magazine . All I 'm saying is quid pro quo . Sidney is unable to hold back a snicker .
SIDNEY: Their star-light ? Eleanor 's face hardens .
SOFTLY: Cuba ?

CLAYTON HARDING: I do n't know . Thousand dollars a plate , all I could taste was ass . I 'm kissing their ass , they 're kissing my ass . I get this dream sometimes . Someone 's set fire to the building - Heywoods - Sharps magazine - the whole thing , it 's going up in flames . My analyst thinks it 's an anxiety dream . I never tell him how happy I am watching the fucker burn . Sidney is n't sure what to say . Finally
SIDNEY: I want to do a story on Vincent Lepak . Not a puff-piece . Something funny , but with teeth . The kind of thing Snipe would have done . Everyone 's treating him like he 's a genius and he 's an idiot .
CLAYTON HARDING: Look at these things . How 'd I get a closet full of blue fucking shirts ?
SIDNEY: UmI do n't know .
CLAYTON HARDING: I do n't know either . This is an office for Christ 's sake ! Why 've I even got a fucking closet ? He drops the shirts .
SIDNEY: Do it ?
CLAYTON HARDING: Fuck it . Yeah . Do it . He 's an annoying little prick . Go take him down . This is your shot .

SIDNEY: Look I know she 's in . I 'm not a stalker . I just know she 's upset about losing her dog and
FIRMLY: She is n't here .
SIGHING: Well , can I at least check that she got my present ?
ASSISTANT: Okay . Did you send the flowers ?
SNORTING DERISIVELY: Flowers ? Yeah , 'cos she does n't get enough flowers , does she ? No , I sent her the fish . The Young Woman looks suddenly nervous .
ASSISTANT: Oh .
SIDNEY: Gold-fish . In a bowl . Did she get them ?

ASSISTANT: Yeah . It was kinda shocking . Were they dead when you sent them ? Sidney stares at her .

BARMAN: Can I help you ?
SIDNEY: Just a couple of straws please .
ALISON: It'sit 's a novel I 'm working on , alright ?
SIDNEY: Wow .
ALISON: Go ahead . I know . I 'm a walking cliché .
SIDNEY: No - a novel , that'sthat 's pretty impressive . You 're writing it by hand ?
ALISON: Yeah , itI do n't know . It keeps it separate from the magazine work . Makes it seem special . He stares at her .
SIDNEY: You 're full of surprises , Sister .
UNCOMFORTABLE: Uh , yeah , so
SIDNEY: What 's he do , the mystery guy ? Is he a hack too ?
BEAT: Actually he 's a poet .
SIDNEY: Really ? What 's he look like ?
LAUGHING: What ?
SIDNEY: Just most poets you see are n't eally good-looking , are they ? Spend their time stuck in a room , end up looking like Golem . Is he ?
ALISON: He 's very handsome , thank you .
GLOOMILY: Right .
ALISON: You know what I do n't understand ? You 're desperate to get a story in the magazine - so why would n't you play ball with Eleanor , write the puff-piece ?
SIDNEY: I resent being bribed to gush sycophantically about a star , okay ? I choose to gush sycophantically .
SMILING: Well , that 's good .
EMBARRASSED: Okay , wellbetter get going . You take my advice , you 'll get yourself a oyfriend who 's going to show up once in a while .
CLAYTON HARDING: Which makes ita half page left . Lawrence ? Any ideas ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Yeah . Rachel Petkoff , fabulous sixties actress , one of my all time favourites . Just made a wonderful movie called Five Boroughs . I think she 's poised for a come-back and I think we should get there first , do a profile .
CLAYTON HARDING: Sounds good . Let 's do it . Okay that 's it people .
SIDNEY: UhClayton ?
CLAYTON HARDING: What ?
SIDNEY: Did you read my story on Vincent Lepak ?
CLAYTON HARDING: What ? Oh , yeah . That'sthat 's not going to work .
SIDNEY: Rachel Petkoff ? One of you favourite actresses ? You 'd never fucking heard of her ! That was my idea ! Lawrence stops and turns back .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: So it was . You have any more good ideas do n't forget to bring them to my new office .
LIVID: What ? You spend half your life chatting up the staff !
LAWRENCE MADDOX: When I do it it 's called flirting . When you do it it 's called sexual harassment . Consider this an official warning . I wo n't tolerate sexist ehaviour . He walks off . Sidney glowers after him .
SIDNEY: Uh , Lawrence ? This lady 's been looking for you ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Can I help you ?
WOMAN: Are you Lawrence Maddox ? The new deputy editor ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Yes ?
WOMAN: Well , I 've just come to say congratulations on you promotion .
MYSTIFIED: Thank you . I 'm sorry , you are ?
WOMAN: I 'm your present .
INGRID: Hey Mrs Harding .
MRS HARDING: And this is the Fashion Department . Where 's Mr Maddox now ?
INGRID: Oh he 's down the hall . Room 217 .
SIDNEY: Uh , Lawrence ? This isthis is sort of inappropriate is n't it ?
HORRIFIED: Will you please
SIDNEY: Oh God , this isthis is awful
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Hello , Mrs Harding . Girls
TO SIDNEY: Get in .
SIDNEY: I did n't know it was Take Ou Daughters To Work Day . I did n't even know there was a Take Ou daughters To Work Day .
CLAYTON HARDING: Shut up . You know , when I told my wife I 'd hired anothe Brit , she was excited . She still thinks you 're all like something from Pride and Prejudice . But you Sidney you 're like a British person born in New Jersey . Why did I hire you ? Sidney stares at his feet . Suddenly
SIDNEY: I do n't know - why did you hire me ?
CLAYTON HARDING: I had an attack of nostalgia . It 's passed . Like gas .
SIDNEY: What was wrong with my story ?
CLAYTON HARDING: What ?
SIDNEY: Why did you kill my Vincent Lepak story ?
CLAYTON HARDING: It was n't good enough . Plain and simple .
SIDNEY: It was n't good enough ?
CLAYTON HARDING: We do n't do hatchet jobs here .
SIDNEY: It is n't a hatchet job !
CLAYTON HARDING: This opening quotation - `` It 's only too easy to catch people 's attention by doing something worse than anyone else has dared do it before '' Who are you thinking of here ? Vincent o yourself ?
SIDNEY: He 's a talentless , pretentious little twat who thinks cinema egan with Tarantino and someone needs to say it . And you told me to do something with teeth ! You said
CLAYTON HARDING: I 'm trying to run a fucking magazine here ! Sidney stares at him , angry and disappointed .
SIDNEY: `` A free press is the last defence against the Tyranny of Stupidity . ''
IRRITATED: Save me your tin-pot philosophy , okay ?
SIDNEY: It is n't mine . It 's yours . First issue of Snipe .
FURIOUS: Oh , grow the fuck up , will ya ! You 're not Robin Hood and you never were . You bitch about famous people for the same reason I bitched about them . Because they got invited to the Party and you did n't . Well you 're at the Party now so quit bitching and do your job ! You 're on your last life here , you understand ? One more fuck up like today and you 're gone .
SIDNEY: Wo n't you have to run a decision like that past Eleanor first ?
SITTING DOWN: Get out . Sidney crosses to the door .
SIDNEY: Looks like I was too late to save you after all . He walks out .
ALISON: You hired a stripper ?
SIDNEY: I did n't `` hire '' him . Bob did it for a favour .
ALISON: I thought you wanted to be a success here ?
SIDNEY: I do ! It 's just It was n't me . It was Clark . Alison laughs .
ALISON: The famous alter-ego ? How long 's he been hanging around ?
SIDNEY: Since I was a kid . Anytime something got broken , or the athroom got accidentally set on fire - it was n't me . It was Clark . The weird thing is , he kind of took over .
ALISON: How old were you ?
SIDNEY: I do n't know , twenty , twenty one Alison laughs .
ALISON'D: Well , let me tell you , if only you could get rid of that Clark , you could be a real winner .
DEPRESSED: Clayton 's not going to print anything I write . I 've been on salary for six-months and I 've written precisely one hundred and seventy five words . On a dollar- per-word basis , I 'm the highest paid writer in the history of this magazine . He 's not going to renew my contract .
SIGHS: What did you expect , Sidney ? Vincent 's one of Eleanor 's clients . I told you . They 're Untouchables .
SIDNEY: I thought Clayton was different . I really did . The only thing I 'm good at is pissing people off , and he wo n't let me do it . `` My glory walks hand in hand with my doom . '' Troy
ALISON: Troy who ?
SIDNEY: Troy , the movie . He stares around him at the other guests .
ALISON: You cornered me .
SIDNEY: No , I mean it . You 're the person who 's been most , you know uhabusive to me .
ALISON: Alright . I 'll have a beer . Sidney walks off .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Sophie , my darling . Looking avishing as always .
TO MADDOX: You know what I read the othe day ? Your collection of poems - The Hollow Heart ? Man , they 're great .
SOPHIE MAES: You write poems ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: In another life . The BARMAN is handing out drinks .
BARMAN: And a White Russian ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Right here .
SIDNEY: That'sthat 's mine .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: But your name 's not `` Hon '' .
SIDNEY: It 's short for `` Honourable '' .
LAWRENCE: As in , `` the Honourable Sidney Young '' ?
SIDNEY: Can I please ?
LAWRENCE: ( holding it out of
SIDNEY'S REACH: So how come it says `` Hon Young '' ? They made you sound like some Korean medical student . The people gathered around laugh .
SIDNEY: They screwed it up . Please .
LAWRENCE: Sidney baby , you do n't wan na go faking a British title to impress Sophie . It 's the Fourth of July . We 're celebrating the fact that we threw a bunch of British aristocrats out . Sidney smiles tightly . Suddenly
SIDNEY: Why do n't you shut up , Maddox ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Careful Sidney . Remember - if it was n't for us you 'd all be speaking German .
SIDNEY: You 're Canadian . If it was n't fo us you 'd be speaking French .
OLDER MAN: How are you ? Sidney nods gloomily .
SIDNEY: Yup .
OLDER MAN: You should walk with bare feet as much as possible , ground all that negative energy . Sidney examines him .
SIDNEY: Soyou 're a wizard or ?
OLDER MAN: I 'm a spiritual healer .
SIDNEY: You can make a living doing that ?
OLDER MAN: Oh God no . I 'm a dentist . They stare at the party for a moment .
SIDNEY: Umno , thanks .
RACHEL: Hello . No , Lawrence is a wonderful writer . I really felt like he got to the heart of me .
SIDNEY: Sidney . Sidney Young . We met at
GUEST: I saw Five Boroughs the other day and wept !
ALISON: You okay ?

SIDNEY: I 'm fine . Yup . Fine . You ?

QUIETLY: I could n't . That 's why I 've oken up with him .
SIDNEY: Well , that 's nothat 's , you know You broke up with him ? Alison walks off . Beat . She walks back .
ALISON: Which leg did you hurt ?
SOPHIE MAES: You know what ? There 's something very damaged about you . Sidney stares at her , not sure what to say .
SIDNEY: Huh
SOPHIE MAES: Like an animal that 's been hit by a car or something . Like a dee orlike a pig maybe ? When they walk funny and the other animals keep away from them . Little limpy pig . I 'm drawn to sick animals . That 's why I picked Cuba - ecause he had like psychological problems ? Poor little Cuba . Where is he now ?
BEAT: Huh She wipes her eyes , rolls onto her back .
SOPHIE MAES: Jesus , I 'm wasted . Are you wasted ? I 'm wasted . Sidney watches her .
SIDNEY: Congratulations on becoming incredibly famous by the way .
SOPHIE MAES: Thanks .
BEAT: What 's it like ?
SOPHIE MAES: What 's what like ?
SIDNEY: Everything . She rolls her head to look at him solemnly .
SOPHIE MAES: Weird . It 's happening so fast andit 's like it 's got nothing to do with me . It 's like I 'm not even really here . She laughs softly .
SIDNEY: You 're here . She turns back to look at the stars .
SOPHIE MAES: I 'm so hungry .
SIDNEY: Would youwould you like me to get you some food ?
SOPHIE MAES: Are you crazy ? There might still e a photographer around . They lie in silence for a moment .
DREAMILY: You know what would be nice though ? Some coke . She rubs her face , close to falling asleep .
SIDNEY: Wizard ! Wizard Dentist Man ! Need Wizard Dentist Man !
ALISON: None of your business
SIDNEY: You ca n't drive . You need to go and sleep this off somewhere .
ALISON: Firstly , you are a stupid asshole and I hate you and Secondly Secondly
SIDNEY: Yeah , okay . Listen , you try driving in this state you 're gon na kill yourself .
ALISON: Who 'd care if I did ?
SWAYING FORWARD: I 've got to go . Got to go .
SLURRING: I thought I had it all figured out . A - get the hell out of Port Huron , come to New York . B - do the serious journalism thing to pay the bills while I , you know , write the novel . C- Win a Pulitzer . E
ALISON: D - I do n't know what D was . Then I took the internship at Sharps and I met Maddox and he washe was soand before I know it I 'm writing , you know , Ten Tips fo the fucking Metrosexual and pretending this is what I wanted ut this IS N'T what I wanted ! And that'sthat 's why I hated you
SIDNEY: I did n't know you hated me .
OBLIVIOUS: because you were right about me . I 'm a ghoul , writing fluff !
SIDNEY: You 're not a Ghoul . You 're a Zombie . Alison leans her head against the window .
ALISON: But he is n't the person you think he is , okay ? Maddox . That 's just a front . He thinks he 's let himself down by giving up the poetry and he 's unhappy . And the marriage is a sham , I mean I justI could n't end it . I just could n't and
SIDNEY: Look , I do n't need to hear this .
STUNG: Fine .
SIDNEY: You do n't smoke .
ALISON: Oh yeah . She looks at her reflection in the window .
IRRITATED: Could you just be quiet ? He realises she has started to cry .
ALISON: When I told him I could n't see him any moreI do n't know if he cared . I love him and , and I do n't know if he cares ! Sidney watches , moved .
RELUCTANTLY: Well , I'mI 'm sure he does . He 's probably just not very good at expressing his emotions .
SOBBING: I 'm so fucking sophisticated ! I mean there 's not even a little it of Port Huron left , right ? I 've got the haircut and the jo and I 've got the parties and I 've even , I 've even got the affai ecause that 's what sophisticated fucking people do !
SIDNEY: Alright . Alright . Do n't , you know , get snot everywhere
ALISON: Oh G-God
SIDNEY: What ?
HISSING: Shut up will you ? You 'll wake the old witch up . He stops suddenly and turns .
NUMBLY: Hello Dad .
ALISON: Love this song The three stare after her . Sidney coughs .
SIDNEY: She , uh , she is n't actually a prostitute .
MILDLY: Oh good . Alison dances back into the room .
ALISON: Sooo , Sidney 's dad . Good to meet you . I 'm Alison . I 'm from Port Huron . And you must be Sidney 's mom ?
SHOCKED: No I am not !
ALISON: Oh , okay . My dad married again too , so that 's cool . You wan na dance ?
KINDLY: No thank you .
ALISON: Okay . Where are my cigarettes ? What is that ?
RICHARD YOUNG: I think it is probably cocaine . Sidney closes his eyes .
SIDNEY: It was n't actually for me . I was going to give it to this young actress
OBLIVIOUS: So , hey , visiting your boy . That 's nice . You must be pretty proud of him , huh ?
DYING: I think you should lie down Alison .
ALISON: He 's doing just great at the magazine . Alison ruffles Sidney 's hair clumsily .
SIDNEY: Really Alison , I think
ALISON: But I think that was pretty much an act . So , Mister Sidney , whatcha doing here ?
SMILING: Please , call me Richard . I 've written a little book so I 'm doing a few talks .
ALISON: A book ! Hey - I 'm writing a book . What 's yours about ? Do n't tell me - it 's a thriller , right ?
LAUGHING: No , nothing so interesting I 'm afraid . I 'm a philosopher .
SURPRISED: Philosophy ? Really ? Have you written any
TO SIDNEY: I 'd love to hear what you think of the book if you have time to ead it . Alison snorts with laughter .
ALISON: What would Sidney know about philosophy ?
RICHARD YOUNG: Well , he does have a Masters in the subject .
ALISON: You 're shitting me ! Sidney ? Hehe likes Con Air !
MRS KOWALSKI: Come on . It is time you went to ed . You can sleep on the couch .
ALISON: Okay . Better go before I find out something else I do n't know about Sidney . Mrs Kowalski turns to Richard .
MRS KOWALSKI: It was a pleasure to meet you Lord Young . Alison stares at Sidney who smiles weakly .
SIDNEY: You should have said you were coming .
WRYLY: That would have required you answering one of my calls .
SIDNEY: I 've been pretty busy .
RICHARD YOUNG: Which reminds me , I was talking to a publisher friend of mine the other day . He mentioned that they were planning a series of introductory texts on philosophers . I wondered if you would be interested ?
ANNOYED: I have a job , dad .
RICHARD YOUNG: Of course , of course . I picked up a copy of your magazine at the airport . Sidney stiffens a little .
IRRITATED: Why 've you always got to do this ? It'sit 's
RICHARD YOUNG: It was just a joke Sidney
SIDNEY: Actually it 's not . Because you 're saying that what I do for a living is worthless and
RICHARD YOUNG: I do n't think it 's worthless . I just think , in your heart , you know you could do more with you life than
ANGRY: More ? Sharps is one of the most espected magazines in the world . There 's a million hacks who would kill to be where I am now .
RICHARD YOUNG: I do n't know who
SIDNEY: I KNOW you do n't know who that is ! You do n't know who anyone is ! You thought Brad Pitt was a cave in Yorkshire ! But most people do know who they are , okay ? And most people would n't think that a journalist who gets to mix with stars like that was a , a disappointment !
PAINED: I do n't think you 're a disappointment Sidney . I 've neve thought that .
SADLY: I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to upset you .
QUIETLY: Things have n't really been that great . I do n't know what it is . I 'm not getting ahead . Richard stops , turns back to his son . Beat .
GENTLY: If you 're not happy
SIDNEY: No . I 'm fine . I know I can make it .
RICHARD YOUNG: Einstein said `` Try not to become a man of success but rather to ecome a man of value . '' Sidney does n't answer .
SIDNEY: What ? No . We 're just friends .
SMILING: I saw the way you looked at her . Sidney considers this , knowing it 's true .
SIDNEY: She does n't feel that way about me . New York women do n't date losers .
SMILING: I suppose not . But Alison is from Port Huron , is n't she ? Sidney stares at him .
ALISON: I do n't remember very much but I 'm so , so sorry . I 'll get myself together and get going
SIDNEY: Why ? No , you 're all right . It'sit 's nice to have the company .
REMEMBERING: Oh Godyour father . And that woman .
SIDNEY: Mrs Kowalski ? Do n't worry about it . The last woman she caught me with had a penis , so you knowyou 're a big step up .
ALISON: Thanks .
BEAT: That 's my mother .
ALISON: No way !
SIDNEY: Yeah , I do n't take after her
ALISON: Was she a model ?
SIDNEY: Actress .
ALISON: Wow . Movies ?
SIDNEY: Some . British , small parts
ALISON: Is she
SIDNEY: No , she died when I was young .
ALISON: Must have been pretty cool having your mom in the movies .
SIDNEY: Yeah , I suppose . I used to see her on the TV every now and then when I was growing up . Sort of weird . He carries the plates over to her .
ALISON: You do ?
SIDNEY: I do . Can I read the rest of it ? Believe it or not , I 'm a pretty good editor .
ALISON: I do n't know . I do n't even know if I 'm going to bother finishing it .
SIDNEY: `` Keep true to the dreams of thy youth . '' Alison examines him through narrowed eyes .
ALISON: Is that from Troy again ?
SIDNEY: Schiller . She puts her things back in her bag .
ALISON: I 'll jump in the shower and then I really will get out of you hair . Sidney watches , not wanting her to go .
SIDNEY: Oh , I forgotI got you a present .
ALISON: That'sI do n't know what to say . I have n't got a turntable .
SIDNEY: Oh . Well , you can always come here to listen to it .
ALISON: Are you kidding ? I could throw up on you again .
SIDNEY: C'mon
INGRID: Hey , Alice ? Versace . You like ?
ALISON: I 'm good , thanks .
INGRID: Honey , everyone needs to change their look every now and then . Especially if they have a new man in their life .
EMBARRASSED: What are you talking about ?
LAUGHING: Tell me it is n't so .
ANNOYED: Of course not .
ANNA: Thank God . Can you imagine ? He 's such a creep .
INGRID: Oh do n't be crazy ! Alice ? Is Anna fat ?
BRIGHT: Not at all . Why , she 's so thin I could just take her little spindly body and snap it over my knee like a dry fucking twig .
AUTOMATICALLY: Thanks .
ALISON: Oh , and for your information Sidney Young has got more going for him than most of the men in this town .
SIDNEY: Hey Alison , I was wondering if you wanted to Hello there . Listen I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie ora mealor Alison . You wan na go on a date ?
VINCENT: I 'm not wearing a costume .
SIDNEY: Oh . They walk on .
MUTTERING: Idiot .
MUTTERING: Wanker .
ALISON: That 's why I do n't go there any more .
SIDNEY: ( Mumbling through his
TEETH: Me first . Listen I was wondering if you want to go to the movies or maybe for a , uh .

LAWRENCE MADDOX: Back in a minute .
EMBARRASSED: I wanted to tell you . Lawrence has left his wife . We 're going to e together . Officially . She watches for Sidney 's reaction .
DYING: Wellthat'sthat 's brilliant .
ALISON: Yeah , somaybe he does care after all , right ?
SIDNEY: Yup .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Hello Sidney . Someone said you 'd come as a Count but I thought I 'd misheard . Sidney does n't answer , turns to leave .
TIGHT: Yeah .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Yeah . Should have done it long ago but , you know me - just not very good at expressing my emotions . Right ?
LAUGHING: Oh SidaleeI thought as much . Did you really think you and Alison ? Things really have n't worked out too well for you here , have they ? Ah , well . You gave it your best shot .
SIDNEY: Wait ! Eleanor wait ! The window glides down .
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Yes ?
SIDNEY: Let me do the profile on Vincent .
AMUSED: I do n't think so .
SIDNEY: You get full copy approval . It 'll e like you 've written it !
DETERMINED: Vincent - think about it , think how humiliating it will be fo me . I 'm begging you .
VINCENT: You do n't look like you 're egging .
CLAYTON HARDING: Lawrence Maddox is no longe working for Sharps . Seems Elizabeth got sick of him screwing around and kicked him out .
SIDNEY: She kicked him out ?
IGNORING THIS: Richard Heywood does n't seem to like the idea of employing an ex- son-in-law . So he 's gone . So 's Alison Olsen . Sidney stares at him .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Well , welllittle Sidalee . I feel like a proud Papa .
ALISON: Right . How hot is she ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Who ?
ALISON: The new talent ?
LAWRENCE MADDOX: Do you think you could drop the little wife routine ? It 's kind of in bad taste . Alison stares at him sadly
ALISON: I guess you 're right . What goes around comes around .
LAWRENCE MADDOX: I 'll see you back home .
IRRITATED: And will you stop carrying that thing around with you ? It 's kind of embarrassing . He walks off .
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Sophie 's going to get a Golden Globe nomination for best actress .
SIDNEY: Wow . That 's fantastic . Butthe nominations have n't een announced yet ?
ELEANOR JOHNSON: That is correct so we have absolutely no way of knowing whether or not she will be nominated . So , if she is nominated we want Sharps to do a feature . Someone to cover the whole lead up , unrestricted access , the trajectory , the uilding of this unique brand .
SOPHIE MAES: I 'm going to have a logo .
ELEANOR JOHNSON: Here 's the deal . Sophie wants you to do it .

FIERCE: Arggghhhhh ! Mornin ' !
HOARK: What are you doing out ! ?
HICCUP: Burnthair the Broad
BURNTHAIR: Get inside !
HICCUP: Phlegma the Fierce
STOICK: Hiccup ! ? What is he doing out again ? !
TO HICCUP: What are you doing out ? ! Get inside !
IN AWE: That 's Stoick the Vast . Chief of the tribe . They say that when he was a baby he popped a dragon 's head clean off of its shoulders . Do I believe it ?
STOICK: What have we got ?
VIKING #1: Gronkles . Nadders . Zipplebacks . Oh , and Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare .
STOICK: Any Night Furies ?
VIKING #1: None so far .
RELIEVED: Good .
VIKING: Hoist the torches !
GOBBER: Ah ! Nice of you to join the party . I thought you 'd been carried off .
HICCUP: Who me ? Nah , come on ! I 'm way too muscular for their taste . They would n't know what to do with all this . Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose .
GOBBER: They need toothpicks , do n't they ?
STOICK: We move to the lower defenses . We 'll counter-attack with the catapults .
DREAMY: Astrid .
PLEADING: Ah , come on . Let me out , please . I need to make my mark .
GOBBER: Oh , you 've made plenty of marks . All in the wrong places .
HICCUP: Please , two minutes . I 'll kill a dragon . My life will get infinitely etter . I might even get a date .
GOBBER: You ca n't lift a hammer . You ca n't swing an axe
HICCUP: Okay fine , but
VIKING: Arggh !
GOBBER: See , now this right here is what I 'm talking about .
HICCUP: Mild calibration issue .
GOBBER: Hiccup . If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons , you need to stop all
ASTONISHED: But you just pointed to all of me .
GOBBER: Yes ! That 's it ! Stop being all of you .
THREATENING: Ohhhh
MIMICKING: Ohhhhh , yes .
HICCUP: You , sir , are playing a dangerous game . Keeping this much , awVikingness contained .
BEAT: There will be consequences ! Gobber tosses him a sword .
GOBBER: I 'll take my chances . Sword . Sharpen . Now .
CATAPULT OPERATOR: They found the sheep !
FRUSTRATED: Concentrate fire over the lowe ank !
CATAPULT OPERATOR: Fire !
STOICK: Reload ! I 'll take care of this .
VIKING: Night Fury ! Get down !
BEAT: No one has ever killed a Night Fury . That 's why I 'm going to be the first .
GOBBER: Man the fort , Hiccup , they need me out there !
VIKING #7: Come back here !
HICCUP: I know . Be right back !
STOICK: Mind yourselves ! The devils still have some juice in them .
TO HIMSELF: Come on . Give me something to shoot at , give me something to shoot at .
STOICK: ( to his men , re the
NADDERS: DO NOT let them escape !
SHEEPISH: Okay , but I hit a Night Fury .
STOICK: STOP ! Just.stop .
HICCUP: Between you and me , the village could do with a little less feeding , do n't ya think ? A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously .
STOICK: This is n't a joke , Hiccup !
EXASPERATED: Why ca n't you follow the simplest orders ?
HICCUP: I ca n't stop myself . I see a dragon and I have to just kill it , you know ? It 's who I am , Dad .
STOICK: You are many things , Hiccup . But a dragon killer is not one of them .
TO GOBBER: Make sure he gets there . I have his mess to clean up . Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction .
TUFFNUT: Quite the performance .
SNOTLOUT: I 've never seen anyone mess up that adly . That helped !
HICCUP: Thank you , thank you . I was trying , so
GOBBER: Sure , Hiccup .
HICCUP: He never listens .
GOBBER: Well , it runs in the family .
HICCUP: And when he does , it 's always with this disappointed scowl . Like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich .
MIMICKING STOICK: Excuse me , barmaid . I 'm afraid you ought me the wrong offspring . I ordered an extra large boy with eefy arms . Extra guts and glory on the side . This here . This is a talking fish bone .
GOBBER: You 're thinking about this all wrong . It 's not so much what you look like . It 's what 's inside that he ca n't stand . Beat .
HICCUP: Thank you , for summing that up . They reach the doorway .
GOBBER: Look , the point is , stop trying so hard to be something you 're not . Hiccup SIGHS heavily .
HICCUP: I just want to be one of you guys .
STOICK: Either we finish them or they 'll finish us ! It 's the only way we 'll e rid of them ! If we find the nest and destroy it , the dragons will leave . They 'll find anothe home .
DECIDEDLY: One more search . Before the ice sets in .
VIKING: Those ships never come back .
FEEBLE: Today 's not good for me .
EQUALLY FEEBLE: I 've got ta do my axe returns .
STOICK: Alright . Those who stay will look after Hiccup .
SPITELOUT: I 'm with you Stoick !
DRY: That 's more like it .
GOBBER: I 'll pack my undies .
STOICK: No , I need you to stay and train some new recruits .
GOBBER: Oh , perfect . And while I 'm busy , Hiccup can cover the stall . Molten steel , razor sharp blades , lots of time to himselfwhat could possibly go wrong ?
STOICK: What am I going to do with him Gobber ?
GOBBER: Put him in training with the others .
STOICK: No , I 'm serious .
GOBBER: So am I. Stoick turns to him , glaring .
STOICK: He 'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage .
GOBBER: Oh , you do n't know that .
STOICK: I do know that , actually .
GOBBER: No , you do n't .
STOICK: No , actually I do .
GOBBER: No you do n't !
STOICK: Listen ! You know what he 's like . From the time he could crawl he 's eendifferent . He does n't listen .
DEFENSIVE: Trolls exist ! They steal you socks .
DARKLY: But only the left ones . What 's with that ?
STOICK: When I was a boy
GRUMBLING: Oh here we go .
STOICK: My father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it . I thought it was crazy , but I did n't question him . And you know what happened ?
GOBBER: You got a headache .
STOICK: That rock split in two . It taught me what a Viking could do , Gobber . He could crush mountains , level forests , tame seas ! Even as a boy , I knew what I was , what I had to ecome .
BEAT: Hiccup is not that boy .
GOBBER: You ca n't stop him , Stoick . You can only prepare him .
BEAT: Look , I know it seems hopeless . But the truth is you wo n't always be around to protect him . He 's going to get out there again . He 's probably out there now . ON STOICK , as Gobber 's words hit their mark .
HICCUP: Uggh , the gods hate me . Some people lose their knife or their mug . No , not me . I manage to lose an entire dragon .
IN SHOCK: Oh wow . I did it . I did it . This fixes everything .
ELATED: Yes !
BEAT: I am a VIKING !
STOICK: Hiccup .
CAUGHT: Dad . Uh Stoick stands , takes a deep breath .
STOICK: I need to speak with you too , son .
HICCUP: No , you go first .
STOICK: Alright . You get your wish . Dragon training . You start in the morning .
SCRAMBLING: Oh man , I should 've gone first . Uh , 'cause I was thinking , you know we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings , but do we have enough ead-making Vikings , or small home
STOICK: You 'll need this .
HICCUP: I do n't want to fight dragons .
STOICK: Come on . Yes , you do .
HICCUP: Rephrase . Dad I ca n't kill dragons .
STOICK: But you will kill dragons .
HICCUP: No , I 'm really very extra sure that I wo n't .
STOICK: It 's time Hiccup .
HICCUP: Can you not hear me ?
STOICK: This is serious son !
HICCUP: You just gestured to all of me .
STOICK: Deal ?
HICCUP: This conversation is feeling very one-sided .
RESIGNED: Deal .
STOICK: Good . Train hard . I 'll be back . Probably .
HICCUP: And I 'll be here . Maybe .
GOBBER: Welcome to dragon training !
ASTRID: No turning back .
TUFFNUT: I hope I get some serious burns .
RUFFNUT: I 'm hoping for some mauling , like on my shoulder or lower back .
ASTRID: Yeah , it 's only fun if you get a scar out of it .
TUFFNUT: Oh great . Who let him in ?
GOBBER: Let 's get started ! The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village .
SNOTLOUT: Hiccup already killed a Night Fury , so does that disqualify him or ?
TUFFNUT: Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings ?
GOBBER: Do n't worry . You 're small and you 're weak . That 'll make you less of a target . They 'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Viking-like teens instead .
FISHLEGS: Speed eight . Armor sixteen .
GOBBER: The Hideous Zippleback .
FISHLEGS: Plus eleven stealth . Times two .
GOBBER: The Monstrous Nightmare .
FISHLEGS: Firepower fifteen .
GOBBER: The Terrible Terror .

GOBBER: I believe in learning on the job .
HICCUP: A doctor ?
FISHLEGS: Plus five speed ?
ASTRID: A shield .
GOBBER: Shields . Go .
TUFFNUT: Get your hands off my shield !
RUFFNUT: There are like a million shields !
TUFFNUT: Take that one , it has a flower on it . Girls like flowers .
RUFFNUT: Ooops , now this one has blood on it .
GOBBER: Tuffnut , Ruffnut , you 're out !
DAZED: What ? !
CONFUSED: What ? !
GOBBER: Those shields are good for anothe thing . Noise . Make lots of it to throw off a dragon 's aim .
SNOTLOUT: Five !
FISHLEGS: No , six .
GOBBER: Correct , six . That 's one for each of you !
FISHLEGS: I really do n't think my parents
WOULD: BAM ! Fishlegs has his shield blasted away .
GOBBER: Fishlegs , out .
SNOTLOUT: So anyway I 'm moving into my parents ' basement . You should come y sometime to work out . You look like you work out
GOBBER: Snotlout ! You 're done !
VOICE BREAKING: So , I guess it 's just you and me huh ?
ASTRID: No . Just you .
GOBBER: One shot left !
WORRIED: Hiccup !
HICCUP: always go for the kill .
MUTTERED: Sowhy did n't you ?
ASTRID: I mistimed my summersault dive . It was sloppy . It threw off my everse tumble . Eye rolls from the group .
SARCASTIC: Yeah . We noticed .
SNOTLOUT: No , no , you were great . That was so 'Astrid ' .
GOBBER: She 's right , you have to be tough on yourselves .
RUFFNUT: He showed up .
TUFFNUT: He did n't get eaten .
ASTRID: He 's never where he should be .
GOBBER: Thank you , Astrid . Gobber stands .
TUFFNUT: Wait , you mean read ?
RUFFNUT: While we 're still alive ?
SNOTLOUT: Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about ?
FISHLEGS: Oh ! I 've read it like , seven times . There 's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face . And there 's this other one that uries itself for like a week The teens stare as Fishlegs goes on too long .
TUFFNUT: Yeah , that sounds great . There was a chance I was going to read that
RUFFNUT: but now Snotlout gets up to go .
SNOTLOUT: You guys read , I 'll go kill stuff . The others follow , with Fishlegs in tow .
FISHLEGS: Oh and there 's this other one that has these spines that look like trees Astrid is the last to go .
HICCUP: So I guess we 'll share
ASTRID: Read it . She pushes it toward him and leaves .
HICCUP: All mine then . Wow , so okay . I 'll
SEE YOU: Slam .
STOICK: I can almost smell them . They 're close . Steady . Stoick raises his gaze to
VIKING: Hard to port for Helheim 's gate .
HICCUP: You know , I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies . Is there another book ? Or a sequel ? Maybe a little Night Fury pamphlet ?
FISHLEGS: I 'm really beginning to question your teaching methods .
GOBBER: Look for its blind spot . Every dragon has one . Find it , hide in it , and strike .
WHISPERED: Do you ever bathe ?
TUFFNUT: If you do n't like it , then just get your own blind spot .
RUFFNUT: How about I give you one !
GOBBER: Blind spot ? Yes . Deaf spot ? Not so much .
HICCUP: Hey , so how would one sneak up on a Night Fury ?
GOBBER: None one 's ever met one and lived to tell the tale . Now get in there .
HICCUP: I know , I know , but hypothetically
WHISPERED: Hiccup !
SNOTLOUT: Watch out babe . I 'll take care of this .
ASTRID: Hey ! Snotlout MISSES . Astrid glares at him .
DEFENSIVE: The sun was in my eyes , Astrid . What do you want me to do , block out the sun ? I could do that , but I do n't have time right now !
HICCUP: They probably take the daytime off . You know , like a cat . Has anyone ever seen one napping ?
GOBBER: Hiccup !
ASTRID: Hiccup !
TUFFNUT: Oooh ! Love on the battlefield !
RUFFNUT: She could do better .
HICCUP: Just let me why do n't you
GOBBER: Well done , Astrid .
ASTRID: Is this some kind of a joke to you ? Our parents ' war is about to become ours . Figure out which side you 're on .
HICCUP: Huh . Toothless . I could 've sworn you had
GOBBER: and with one twist he took my hand and swallowed it whole . And I saw the look on his face . I was delicious . He must have passed the word , because it was n't a month before another one of them took my leg .
FISHLEGS: Is n't it weird to think that you hand was inside a dragon . Like if your mind was still in control of it you could have killed the dragon from the inside by crushing his heart or something .
SNOTLOUT: I swear I 'm so angry right now . I 'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot . I 'll chop off the legs of every dragon I fight , with my face . He postures to Astrid . She rolls her eyes .
GOBBER: Un-unh . It 's the wings and the tails you really want . If it ca n't fly , it ca n't get away . A downed dragon is a dead dragon .
TUFFNUT: It 's gon na be me .
BEAT: It 's my destiny . See ?
GASPS: Your mom let you get a tattoo ?
TUFFNUT: It 's not a tattoo . It 's a irthmark .
RUFFNUT: Okay , I 've been stuck with you since birth , and that was neve there before .
TUFFNUT: Yes it was . You 've just never seen me from the left side until now .
SNOTLOUT: It was n't there yesterday . Is it a irthmark or a today-mark ?
HICCUP: Hey Toothless . I brought breakfast . I hope you 're hungry .
PLEASED: There . Not too bad . It works .
FISHLEGS: Razor sharp , serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion . Prefers ambush attack , crushing its victims in its
TENSE: Will you please stop that ?
SNOTLOUT: If that dragon shows either of his faces , I 'm gon na There !
ASTRID: Hey !
RUFFNUT: It 's us , idiots . Astrid and Ruffnut are soaked .
TUFFNUT: Your butts are getting bigger . We thought you were a dragon .
TO ASTRID: Not that there 's anything wrong with a dragon-esque figure .
ASTRID: Wait .
TUFFNUT: Oh , I 'm hurt . I am very much hurt .
FISHLEGS: Chances of survival are dwindling into single digits now
HICCUP: Look out !
FISHLEGS: Oh . Wrong head .
GOBBER: Fishlegs !
HICCUP: Oh , come on !
HICCUP: BACK ! BACK ! BACK ! Now do n't you make me tell you again !
FISHLEGS: Hey Hiccup , I 've never seen a Gronkle to that before .
TUFFNUT: How 'd you do that ?
RUFFNUT: It was really cool . He squirms and invents an excuse .
HICCUP: I left my axe back in the ring . He turns and hurries back .
FISHLEGS: Hey Hiccup !
SNOTLOUT: What was that ? Some kind of trick ? What did you do ?
TUFFNUT: Hiccup , you 're totally going to come in first , there 's no question .
GOBBER: Meet the Terrible Terror .
TUFFNUT: Ha . It 's like the size of my Tuffnut is taken down in a blur .
TO ASTRID: Wow , he 's better than you eve were .
HICCUP: Oh , great .
VIKING: Hiccup .
HICCUP: Astrid . Hey ! Hi Astrid . Hi Astrid . Hi Astrid .
ASTRID: I normally do n't care what people do , but you 're acting weird . Well , weirder .
VIKING: Where are the other ships ?
SPITELOUT: You do n't want to know .
GOBBER: Well , I trust you found the nest at least ?
STOICK: Not even close .
GOBBER: Ah . Excellent .
STOICK: I hope you had a little more success than me .
GOBBER: Well , if by success , you mean that your parenting troubles are ove with , then yes . Stoick stops . What does that mean ? A group of merry villagers rush past .
VIKING #1: Congratulations Stoick ! Everyone is so relieved .
VIKING #2: Out with the old and in with the new , right ? !
VIKING #3: No one will miss that old nuisance !
VIKING #4: The village is throwing a party to celebrate !
STOICK: He 's gone ?
GOBBER: Yeahmost afternoons . But who can lame him ? I mean the life of a celebrity is very rough . He can arely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans . Stoick is doubly confused .
STOICK: Hiccup ?
BEAMING: Who would 've thought , eh ? He has thisway with the beasts .
HICCUP: Okay there bud , we 're gon na take this nice and slow .
SHEET: Position four , no three .
HICCUP: Uh..no thanks . ( gesturing to his fish on
A STICK: I 'm good .
PENSIVE: Everything we know about you guys is wrong .
HICCUP: Dad ! You 're back !
STOICK: I know . I came looking for you .
CAUGHT: You did ?
STERN: You 've been keeping secrets .
HICCUP: Ihave ?
STOICK: Just how long did you think you could hide it from me ?
IN VAIN: I do n't know what you 're
STOICK: Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it .
HICCUP: Oh ?
STOICK: So .
BEAT: Let 's talk about that dragon . Blood drains from Hiccup 's face .
HICCUP: Oh gods . Dad I 'm so sorry . I was going to tell you . I just did n't know how to
STOICK: What ? ! I was hoping for this !
HICCUP: Uhyou were ?
STOICK: And believe me , it only gets etter ! Just wait til you spill a Nadder 's guts for the first time . Hiccup 's elated expression sinks .
RELIEVED: Ahhhhh . With you doing so well in the ring , we finally have something to talk about .
SINCERE: Wow . Thanks . Hiccup accepts it , looking it over .
STOICK: Your mother would 've wanted you to have it .
HEARTFELT: It 's half of her breast plate . Stoick taps his own helmet and smiles .
HICCUP: I should really get to bed .
STOICK HICCUP: ( talking over each ( talking over each
STOICK: Well..uh..good night .
ASTRID: Stay out of my way ! I 'm winning this thing .
HICCUP: Please , by all means .
ASTRID: This time . This time for sure .
STOICK: Wait ! Wait !
HICCUP: So , later . Gobber snags Hiccup as he attempts to leave .
GOBBER: Not so fast .
HICCUP: I 'm kinda late for
LIVID: What ? Late for what exactly ?
STOICK: Okay quiet down . The elder has decided .
GOBBER: You 've done it ! You 've done it , Hiccup ! You get to kill the dragon !
STOICK: Ha , ha ! That 's my boy !
MASKING PANIC: Heh , heh . Oh yeah ! Yes ! I ca n't wait . I am so
HICCUP: leaving . We 're leaving . Let 's pack up . Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation , forever .
SHOCKED: Aggh ! What the
RECOMPOSING: What are you doing here ?
ASTRID: I want to know what 's going on . No one just gets as good as you do . Especially you . Start talking ! Are you training with someone ?
HICCUP: Uhtraining ? She grabs him by his odd-looking harness .
ASTRID: It better not involve this .
HICCUP: I know this looks really bad , but you seethis is , uh
PANICKED: You 're right ! You 're right . I 'm through with the lies . I 've been making outfits . So you got me . It 's time everyone knew . Drag me ack . Go ahead . Here we go .
ASTRID: That 's for the lies .
FEEBLE: Oh man . She dives onto Hiccup .
ASTRID: Get down ! Run ! Run !
HICCUP: No !
CALMING: She 's a friend .
TO ASTRID: You just scared him .
ASTRID: I scared him ! ? Hiccup makes a “ be quiet ” motion .
HICCUP: We 're dead .
TO TOOTHLESS: Where do you think you 're going ?
ASTRID: Oh great Odin 's ghost , this is it !
HICCUP: You have to give me a chance to explain .
ASTRID: I 'm not listening to ANYTHING you have to say !
HICCUP: Then I wo n't speak . Just let me show you . Hiccup extends a hand .
ASTRID: Now get me down .
HICCUP: Toothless ? Down . Gently .
ASTRID: Okay ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! Just get me off of this thing .
BEAT: He 's amazing .
WHISPERED: kill a dragon .
HICCUP: Do n't remind me .
ASTRID: What 's going on ?
HICCUP: I do n't know .
BEAT: Toothless . You 've got to get us out of here , bud . Toothless HISSES .
WHISPERED: It looks like they 're hauling in their kill . The Zippleback eyes them ravenously .
ASTRID: What does that make us ?
HICCUP: What my dad would n't give to find this .
ASTRID: They 're not eating any of it .
HICCUP: Alright buddy , we got ta get out of here . Now !
ASTRID: No , no , it totally makes sense . It 's like a giant beehive . They 're the workers and that 's thei queen . It controls them .
HICCUP: No , no ! Not yet . They 'll kill Toothless .
ASTRID: Hiccup , we just discovered the dragons ' nestthe thing we 've een after since Vikings first sailed here . And you want to keep it a secret ? To protect your pet dragon ? Are you serious ? Hiccup stands firm , resolute .
HICCUP: Yes . Astrid 's taken aback .
ASTRID: Okay .
BEAT: Then what do we do ?
HICCUP: Just give me until tomorrow . I 'll figure something out .
ASTRID: Okay . Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm .
HICCUP: What are you looking at ?
STOICK: Well , I can show my face in public again .
PLAYFUL: If someone had told me that in a few short weeks , Hiccup would go from being , well Hiccup , to placing first in dragon training I would 've tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he 'd gone mad . Yes ! And you know it !
BEAT: But here we are . And no one 's more surprised
ASTRID: Be careful with that dragon .
HICCUP: It 's not the dragon I 'm worried about .
WORRIED: What are you going to do ?
HICCUP: Put an end to this . She eyes him , dubious .
BEAT: Astrid . If something goes wrong just make sure they do n't find Toothless .
GRIM: I will . Just promise me it wo n't go wrong . Hiccup ca n't . Gobber approaches .
GOBBER: It 's time , Hiccup . Knock him dead .
TUFFNUT: Show 'em how it 's done , my man !
MUTTERED: Hrmph . I would 've gone for the hammer .
HICCUP: I 'm ready .
STOICK: What is he doing ?
WHISPERED: It 's okay . It 's okay .
STOICK: Stop the fight .
HICCUP: No . I need you all to see this . The crowd gets restless .
STOICK: Out of my way !
ASTRID: Hiccup !
STOICK: This way !
GOBBER: Night Fury ! Get down !
PANICKED: Alright , Toothless , go . Get out of here ! The crowd is gob-smacked , growing livid .
VIKINGS: Night Fury !
HICCUP: Go ! GO !
VIKING: Take it alive !
ASTRID: Stoick no !
HICCUP: Dad ! No ! He wo n't hurt you !
VIKING: Get him !
DESPERATE: No ! Pleasejust do n't hurt him . Please do n't hurt him .
STOICK: Put it with the others ! His burning glare turn to Hiccup .
ON HICCUP: Being shoved into the dank , dimmed hall .
STOICK: I should have known . I should have seen the signs .
HICCUP: Dad .
STOICK: We had a deal !
FLUSTERED: I know we did but that was efore ughh , it 's all so messed up .
STOICK: So everything in the ring . A trick ? A lie ?
HICCUP: I screwed up . I should have told you before now . Take this out on me , be mad at me , but please just do n't hurt Toothless .
STOICK: The dragon ? That 's what you 're worried about ? Not the people you almost killed ? !
HICCUP: He was just protecting me ! He 's not dangerous .
STOICK: They 've killed HUNDREDS OF US !
HICCUP: And we 've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM ! They defend themselves , that 's all ! They raid us because they have to ! If they do n't bring enough food ack , they 'll be eaten themselves .
BEAT: There 's something else on thei island dadit 's a dragon like Stoick HUFFS .
STOICK: Their island ?
HICCUP: Did I say nest ? Hiccup goes silent he said too much .
STOICK: How did you find it ? !
HICCUP: No I did n't . Toothless did . Only a dragon can find the island .
STOICK: You 've thrown your lot in with them . You 're not a Viking .
BEAT: You 're not my son .
CALLING OUT: Ready the ships !
STOICK: Set sail ! We head for Helheim 's Gate .
ASTRID: It 's a mess . Hiccup does n't respond .
HICCUP: Thank you for summing that up .
ASTRID: Yep . The rest of us would have done it .
BEAT: So why did n't you ?
HICCUP: I do n't know . I could n't .
ASTRID: That 's not an answer .
BECOMING IRATE: Why is this so important to you all of a sudden ?
ASTRID: Because I want to remember what you say right now .
HICCUP: Oh for the love of I was a coward ! I was weak . I would n't kill a dragon .
ASTRID: You said 'would n't ' that time .
BLOWS UP: Whatever ! I would n't ! Three hundred years and I 'm the first Viking who would n't kill a dragon !
ASTRID: First to ride one , though .
REALIZING: I would n't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was .
BEAT: I looked at him and I saw myself . Astrid turns to face the open sea .
ASTRID: I bet he 's really frightened now .
PROVOKING: What are you going to do about it ? Beat .
HICCUP: Probably something stupid .
ASTRID: Good . But you 've already done that . Another beat .
HICCUP: Then something crazy . Astrid smiles .
ASTRID: That 's more like it .
STOICK: Sound your positions . Stay within earshot . Shouts pour in from all directions .

STOICK: Find the nest and take it .
GOBBER: Ah . Of course . Send them running . The old Viking fall-back . Nice and simple .
STOICK: Shhh .
VIKING: Bear to port . The order is called out from ship to ship .
TUFFNUT: You were wise to seek help from the world 's most deadly weapon .
BEAT: It 's me .
HICCUP: Uh
SNOTLOUT: I love this plan .
HICCUP: I did n't
RUFFNUT: You 're crazy .
SULTRY: I like that .
ASTRID: So ? What is the plan ?
GOBBER: Ah . I was wondering where that went .
STOICK: Stay low and ready your weapons .
CORRECTING: Uh-uh .
SNOTLOUT: Wait ! What are you
HICCUP: Relax . It 's okay it 's okay .
SNOTLOUT: Where are you going ? !
HICCUP: You 're going to need something to help you hold on .
STOICK: When we crack this mountain open , all hell is going to break loose .
GOBBER: In my undies . Good thing I brought extras . Stoick TURNS to face the men .
STOICK: No matter how this ends , it ends today .
GOBBER: Is that it ?
SPITELOUT: We 've done it !
STOICK: This is n't over . Form your ranks ! Hold together ! The men SCRAMBLE to organize themselves .

GOBBER: I think I 'll stay , just in case you 're thinking of doing something crazy . Stoick grabs him .
EMPHATIC: I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to hunt .
GOBBER: Then I can double that time .
STOICK: No , me !
HICCUP: Ruff , Tuff , watch your backs ! Move Fishlegs !
TUFFNUT: Look at us , we 're on a dragon ! We 're on dragons , all of us !
HICCUP: Up , let 's move it ! The dragons climb past the Red Death .
GOBBER: Every bit the boar-headed , stubborn Viking you ever were . Stoick is speechless .
HICCUP: Fishlegs , break it down .
FISHLEGS: Okay . Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing .
HICCUP: Okay . Lout , Legs , hang in its blind spot . Make some noise , keep it confused . Ruff , Tuff , find out if it has a shot limit . Make it mad .
RUFFNUT: That 's my specialty .
TUFFNUT: Since when ? Everyone knows I 'm more irritating . See .
EXASPERATED: Just do what I told you . I 'll be ack as soon as I can .

BURDENED: So , whaddya say ? Just keep going ?
HICCUP: ` Afternoon m'lady . Where have you een ?
ASTRID: Winning races . What else ? The real question is where have YOU been ?
HICCUP: Avoiding my dad .
ASTRID: Oh , no . What happened now ?
HICCUP: Oh , you 're gon na love this . I wake up . The sun 's shining . Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop . I saunter down to breakfast , thinking all is right with the world , and I get He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest .
APING STOICK: Son , we need to talk .
APING HICCUP: Not now , Dad . I 've got a whole day of goofing off to get started .
HICCUP: Okay , first of all , I do n't sound like that . What is this character ? And second what is that thing you 're doing with my shoulders ?
ASTRID: ( continuing her impression
OF HICCUP: Aw , thanks , Dad . I 'm pretty impressed with myself , too .
HICCUP: WHEN have I ever done that with my hands ?
ASTRID: You just did . She laughs , playfully .
HICCUP: Okay just ( holding her arms , mock-
STERN: Hold still . It 's very serious . She giggles , trying to hold a straight face .
ASTRID: TO MAKE YOU CHIEF ! Oh , my gods ! She jumps to her feet , beaming
HICCUP: You 're gon na wear out the spring coil . The calibration is very sensitive !
EXCITED: What did you tell him ?
HICCUP: I did n't . By the time he turned around , I was gone .
ASTRID: Well , it 's a lot of responsibility . The map will have to wait for sure , and I 'll need to fly Toothless , since you 'll be too busy
HICCUP: It 's not me , Astrid . All those speeches , and planning , and running the village that 's his thing .
ASTRID: I think you 're missing the point . I mean , chief . What an honor . I 'd be pretty excited . Hiccup shakes his head .
HICCUP: I 'm not like you . You know exactly who you are . You always have . But
ASTRID: What you 're searching for is n't out there , Hiccup . She places a hand on his chest .
BEAT: Maybe you just do n't see it yet .
HICCUP: Maybe . But , y'know there is something out there .
EXASPERATED: Hiccup
HICCUP: Stay close .
ASTRID: Hiccup !
HICCUP: Astrid ! Look out !
ERET: Watch the tail !
ERET: Back again ?
ASTRID: Dragon army ?
HICCUP: Look , we do n't want any trouble .
ERET: Ha ! You should 've thought of that efore you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits !
HICCUP: Wait
ASTRID: What are you talking about ?
HICCUP: You think we did this ?
ERET: Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is , without do-gooder dragon iders sneaking in to rescue them .
HICCUP: What do-gooder there are othe dragon riders ?
ERET: You mean , other than your thieving friend from last night ? You tell me .
HICCUP: Drago what-fist ? Does anything you say make sense ?
TEENY: He 's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow .
ERET: This is what he gave me last time I showed up empty-handed . He promised to be far less understanding in the future .
EXASPERATED: Look , we do n't know anything about a dragon thief , or an ice-spitting dragon , or your lunatic boss and his dragon army , okay ?
ERET: Oh , where are my manners ? I 'm Eret . Son of Eret . Finest dragon trappe alive .
HICCUP: And this is Toothless . He says we 're going . Now .
ERET: Heh . They all say that .
ASTRID: Stormfly ! C'mon , go ! Go !
STOICK: Any sign of him ?
GOBBER: Ah , he 's probably flown off the edge of the world by now . You sure you want that kid running the village ? You can still delay you etirement .
STOICK: Oh , he 's ready . You 'll see .
POINT: Huh ? The pride of Berk !
GOBBER: Who finally decided to show up fo work . Yay .
HICCUP: Sorry . Got held up . Hey , Dad , could I have a word ?
STOICK: Something you 're itching to tell me ?
HICCUP: Not quite the itch you 're thinking of , but yes .
STOICK: Good man ! Now , lesson one . A chief 's first duty is to his people . So
HICCUP: Could we just talk in private for
STARKARD: That 's me ! That 's me ! I 'm next ! I was ahead of you ! Excuse me , I 've een here all day !
STOICK: Absolutely ! You got it , sir !
HICCUP: Dad , this is actually a little more important than building saddles .
STOICK: Ah-ah ! Lesson two . No task is too small when it comes to serving you people . Excuse us , Grump .
GOBBER: Grump ! You let the forge die down again !
STOICK: One of these . And this
STOICK: There you go ! Go on . Have away .
HICCUP: But , seriously , I really need to tell you about this new land we came across .
GOBBER: Another one ? !
FISHLEGS: Any new dragons ?
HICCUP: We did n't stick around to find out . These folks were n't particularly friendly .
GOBBER: Oh , really ? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder did n't bring them cheering to the rooftops ? Gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser .
HICCUP: No , this was different . Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha I 've come to enjoy . These guys were trappers . Dragon trappers .
ASTRID: You should 've seen their fort . All lown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice . It was weird .
HICCUP: I 've never seen anything like it . And worst of all , they thought we did it !
GOBBER: Y'know , you two are gon na get yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one of these days . Not everyone appreciates this way of life .
STOICK: Gobber 's right , son . Best we keep to our own . Besides , you 'll have more important uses for your time And pulls a lever , starting it up .
BREATH: Once we make the big announcement !
HICCUP: They are building a dragon army .
TUFFNUT: I 'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon !
RUFFNUT: Or mine .
TUFFNUT: You 're such a moron .
FISHLEGS: A beautiful moron .
SNOTLOUT: Yeah Ruffnut grumbles , revolted by their advances .
STOICK: Bludvist ? Drago Bludvist ?
HICCUP: Uh , yeah . Wait . You know him ?
HICCUP: What ? Why ? !
HICCUP: Whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait ! What is happening ?
GOBBER: You heard the man ! Lock it down !
STOICK: No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word !
HICCUP: Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land ? Stoick turns to Hiccup , gravely serious .
STOICK: Because Drago Bludvist is a madman . Without conscience or mercy . And if he 's built a dragon army gods help us all .
HICCUP: Then let 's ride back out there . We 'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him .
STOICK: No . We fortify the island .
HICCUP: It 's our duty to keep the peace !
STOICK: Peace is over , Hiccup . I must prepare you for war .
HICCUP: War ? Dad , if Drago 's coming for ou dragons , we ca n't wait around fo him to get here . Let 's go find him and change his mind .
STOICK: Some minds wo n't be changed , Hiccup . Berk is what you need to worry about .
BEAT: A chief protects his own . Stoick heads off , calling out more orders
ASTRID: Hiccup , do n't .
HICCUP: I have to . He gives her a quick peck on the cheek .
HICCUP: Come on !
STOICK: Hiccup !
ERET: Keep your eyes peeled , lads ! With this wind , we 'll reach Drago by daybreak , so best we fill this ship up with dragons and quick ! It 's no time to be picky . Not if we want to keep our
UG: Uh Eret ?
HICCUP: Nope . It 's your lucky day . We give up .
ASTRID: What are you doing ?
HICCUP: Toothless , stay .
ASTRID: How is this a plan ?
HICCUP: Just what every dragon trappe needs . One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva . The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas . All it takes is a spark and
ERET: Give me that !
HICCUP: No game . We just want to meet Drago .
ERET: Why ?
HICCUP: Because I 'm going to change his mind about dragons .
ASTRID: He can be really persuasive . Hiccup pets Toothless , thoughtfully .
HICCUP: Once you 've earned his loyalty , there is nothing a dragon wo n't do for you .
ERET: Puh ! You wo n't be changing any minds around here .
HICCUP: I can change yours . Right here . Right now .
ERET: Dragon riders !
HICCUP: Put me down ! Snotlout ! What are you doing ?
SNOTLOUT: See how well I protect and provide ?
TUFFNUT: Aggh ! What is with all the nets ? !
RUFFNUT: Hey watch it ! That was close
GOBBER: We 're here to RESCUE you !
HICCUP: I DO N'T NEED to be rescued !
ERET: Well , did n't you just pick the wrong ship , eh ? I am Eret , son of
GOBBER: Anyone else ?
TO HICCUP: You . Saddle up . We 're going home .
HICCUP: No .
STOICK: Of all the irresponsible
HICCUP: I 'm trying to protect ou dragons and stop a war ! How is that irresponsible ?
RUFFNUT: Stupid .
TUFFNUT: Good one .
STOICK: Aye . We laughed , too
STINGING REGRET: I was to only one to escape .
TO HICCUP: Men who kill without reason can not e reasoned with .
HICCUP: Maybe .
STOICK: Hiccup
HICCUP: I 'm still going to try .
TO TOOTHLESS: Come on .
ASTRID: Let 's go .
STOICK: NO ! Lead the others back to Berk . I 've had enough mutiny for one day .
RUFFNUT: Ooh , I like that .
STOICK: Ruffnut !
PETULANT: Ugh ! Okay !
HICCUP: Do n't worry , bud . I 'm not gon na let anything happen to you . I promise .
ALARMED: Okay .
TO TOOTHLESS: No sudden moves .
WARRIOR: Hiccup ?
BEAT: Could it be ? After all these years ? How is this possible ? The voice is surprisingly female .
HICCUP: Uh , should I should I know you ?
WARRIOR: No . You were only a babe
VALKA: but a mother never forgets .
STOICK: Boar-headed ! Just like his mother ! She could never stay put either .
GOBBER: Ah , he 's just twenty . And a Viking . I mean , could there be a worse combination ? Ha ! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were ack in the day well , not much has changed , actually .
STOICK: You know what he 's like . He wo n't give up , Gobber . And if Hiccup finds Drago , before we find him
GOBBER: Bah ! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury 's around . It 's a Night Fury !
STOICK: Find him , Skullcrusher . Find him .
HICCUP: Hold on ! Wait just a minute ! Come ack here !
VALKA: This way . Come .
HICCUP: You ca n't just say something like that and run off ! You 're my mother ? ! I mean , what the do you grasp how INSANE it sounds ? !
BEAT: I have questions !
VALKA: Come . Quickly !
HICCUP: Where have you been all this time ?
VALKA: You 're not upset ?
HICCUP: What ? No . I do n't know . It 's a bit much to get my head around , to be frank . It 's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy , feral , vigilante dragon lady .
VALKA: At least I 'm not boring right ?
HICCUP: I suppose there is that one specific thing
VALKA: Do you like it ?
HICCUP: I do n't have the words .
VALKA: Can I ? He 's beautiful !
HICCUP: I found him in the woods . He was shot down and wounded .
VALKA: This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist 's iron traps . This Raincutter had her wing sliced y razor netting . And this poo Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare then left to die alone and scared . And what of this ? Did Drago or his trappers do this , too ?
HICCUP: Heh . Well , crazy thing is I 'm actually the one who shot him down . She glares , confused .
VALKA: What did your father think of you Night Fury friend ?
HICCUP: He did n't take it all that well . She mutters in agreement .
VALKA: If only it were possible .
HICCUP: No , really , I
VALKA: Believe me , I tried , as well . But people are not capable of change , Hiccup . Some of us were just born different .
VALKA: Stop ! You 'll only make it worse !
STOICK: Valka , run !
VALKA: Do n't !
STOICK: Hold on !
DISTANT: Stoick !
STOICK: Valka
VALKA: You and your father nearly died that night , all because I could n't kill a dragon .
HICCUP: Yeah , it runs in the family .
VALKA: It broke my heart to stay away , but I believed you 'd be safer if I did .
HICCUP: How did you survive ?
VALKA: Oh , Cloudjumper never meant to harm me . He must 've thought I belonged here
BEAT: Every nest has its queen , but this is king of all dragons .
HICCUP: Wait , that 's the ice-spitter ? He 's esponsible for all that destruction ?
VALKA: He protects us . We all live unde his care . And his command .
HICCUP: Wow . She chuckles , delighting in his awe .
VALKA: You must be hungry .
HICCUP: Uh , yeah . I could eat .
VALKA: Good . It 's feeding time .
ASTRID: I do n't like it . They should 've een back with Hiccup by now .
RUFFNUT: I do n't like it either . Eret son of Eret was the man of my dreams . My everything !
SNOTLOUT: But , baby , I grew facial hair fo you .
FISHLEGS: Me , too .
ASTRID: What if Drago shot them down ? What if they need our help ?
RESOLUTE: We have to find them .
NERVOUSLY: What ? But Stoick said
ASTRID: It does n't matter what he said , if they 've all been captured . Come on ! She flies off , determined .
ERET: We 've nowhere to go ! Nothing to sell ! And no heads to call our own , if we do n't turn up with dragons and fast
ASTRID: Careful what you wish for !
ERET: What is this ? !
ASTRID: A kidnapping .
RUFFNUT: Yay ! Can he ride with me ? Can he ? Can he ? Both Eret and Tuffnut groan in protest .
ASTRID: You 're gon na show us the way to Drago .
ERET: And help dragon riders sneak into Drago 's camp ? Just kill me now .
ASTRID: That can be arranged . Stormfly , drop it .
ASTRID: Works every time .
HICCUP: Hey , I thought we were going to eat ?
VALKA: Oh , we are .
HICCUP: And from Dragon Island , I found this archipelago
VALKA: When I 'm up here , I do n't even feel the cold . I just feel
HICCUP: Free . She smiles at Hiccup . He gleams back .
VALKA: This is what it is to be a dragon , Hiccup .
HICCUP: It 's all well and good to call yourself a dragon .
VALKA: Incredible .
HICCUP: Well , not bad yourself .
VALKA: All this time , you took after me . And where was I ?
REMORSEFUL: I 'm so sorry , Hiccup . Can we start over ? Will you give me anothe chance ?
HICCUP: Did YOU know about this ?
VALKA: Every dragon has its secrets .
BEAT: This gift we share , Hiccup it onds us . This is who you are , son . Who we are . We will change the world for all dragons ! We will make it a better , safer place !
HICCUP: That sounds amazing .
VALKA: What ? There 's no talking to Drago .
HICCUP: But we have to
VALKA: No . We must protect our own .
ERET: Agghh ! Okay ! I got you here , now get this thing off me !
ASTRID: Never take a toy from a dragon . Do n't you know anything ?
STRAINED: Gah ! Why does this keep happening to me ?
ASTRID: What 's down there ?
FISHLEGS: Large diameter bubbles , massive lungs , cold water deep dweller , I 'm thinking class five leviathan , maybe six .
HICCUP: Meatlug ! What 's wrong , girl ?
SOLDIER #1: Watch out ! He 's waking up ! Keep him steady !
SOLDIER #2: Give me some backup here !
DRAGO: Drop the ropes .
SNOTLOUT: Hookfang !
RUFFNUT: Hey !
ASTRID: What are you doing ?
DRAGO: You belong to me now .
ERET: And as an added bonus , I also caught you their riders . No extra charge .
ASTRID: What ? ! Are you kidding me ? !
RUFFNUT: But you were so perfect !
ERET: Turns out , there 's a whole bunch of them out there . They
DRAGO: How many ?
ASTRID: Drago does n't have them after all .
ASTRID: Hundreds ! A whole island full !
ERET: I would n't worry about it . My men are hunting them down as we speak . They wo n't know where you 're hiding . I promise you that .
ASTRID: Oh , yes they will !
DRAGO: Hiccup ?
ERET: He 's not a problem . Really . Trust me .
ASTRID: He 's only the son of Stoick the Vast
DRAGO: Dragon master ? I ALONE control the dragons !
TUFFNUT: Nope .
FISHLEGS: Sorry !
ASTRID: And unless you let us go , right now , he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters !
RUFFNUT: Then they 'll be crying like babies !
SNOTLOUT: Funny and beautiful .
FISHLEGS: Good one , babe !
TUFFNUT: Yeah . Like babies . They always cry . Real tiny ones
DRAGO: First there was one rider . And now all of Berk .
TO ERET: And YOU led them to me . He THROWS Eret across the deck .
ERET: Drago !
ERET: You 're overreacting !
DRAGO: And get rid of him .
ERET: Drago , please The soldiers HURL throwing knives at Eret
DETERMINED: Well , bud , we ca n't wait around fo Drago to attack this place . We 've got ta find him first . Let 's go .
STOICK: Easy now .
HICCUP: Are you kidding me ? How 'd you get in here ?
STOICK: The same way we 're getting you out .
HICCUP: We ? Gobber appears in the arch of a tunnel .
GOBBER: All clear !
STOICK: Toothless . Come . They hurry back into the winding corridor .
HICCUP: Dad ! There 's something you need to know !
STOICK: Yeah , yeah , tell me on the way .
HICCUP: This is n't an on-the-way kind of update , actually
STOICK: I 've heard ENOUGH , Hiccup .
HICCUP: more of the earth-shattering development variety .
STOICK: Yeah , just add it to the pile .
HICCUP: Dad , unlike most surprises I spring on you , this is one you 'll like . I promise ! You just have to handle it delicately , so
GOBBER: Uh , you might want to take this one . Oh , boy .
HICCUP: Dad , can you put the sword away please ?
RATTLED: I know what you 're going to say , Stoick . How could I have done this ? Stayed away all of these years . And why did n't I come back to you ? To our son .
GOBBER: This is why I never married .
BEAT: This and one other reason .
TEARFUL: I know that I left you to raise Hiccup alone but I thought he 'd e better off without me . And I was wrong , I see that now , but Stoick gently reaches a hand toward her face .
STOICK: You 're as beautiful as the day I lost you .
SNOTLOUT: Could this day get any worse ?
TUFFNUT: Uh , let me see . You 'll jump into freezing cold water and then die from drowning .
ERET: Looks refreshing .
ASTRID: You are a steaming heap of dragon
ERET: Duck .
SOLDIER: Warn the others !
RUFFNUT: Get ` em , you son of an Eret !
TUFFNUT: Ugh . Pathetic . You can still jump . Eret avoids Ruffnut and turns to Astrid .
ERET: So ? Are we going to save you dragons and get out of here or not ?
ASTRID: Meatlug ?
ERET: Anyone coming ?
RUFFNUT: I do n't know . You just keep doing what you 're doing . Keep crankin '
ERET: Thank you for saving my life .
BEAT: Now let me return the favor .
HICCUP: Mom , you 'd never recognize it ! Where we used to make weapons , we now build saddles , wing slings we even fix dragon teeth ! You would n't believe how much everything 's changed !
STOICK: Our son 's changed Berk for the etter . I think we did well with this one , Val .
HICCUP: Thanks , Dad .
VALKA: I 'm a little out of practice .
SWEETLY: Well , y'know I did n't marry you for your cooking .
GOBBER: I hope not . Her meatballs could kill more beasts than a battle axe .
HICCUP: And once you move back in , with all of your dragons , Drago wo n't even stand a chance . Everything will be okay !
STOICK: Slow down , son . It 's a lot to take in .
HICCUP: Oh . Gotcha .
GOBBER: Oh , I love this one ! Stoick approaches her delicately .
WHISPERED: Remember our song , Val ?
SINGING SOFTLY: I 'll swim and sail on savage seas , with ne'er a fear of drowning . And gladly ride the waves of life , if you will marry me .
SINGING: No scorching sun , nor freezing cold
SINGING: will stop me on my journey ! ( catching himself ,
EMBARRASSED: Sorry .
SINGING: If you will promise me you heart
SINGING: And love me for eternity .
SINGING: But I would bring you rings of gold . I 'd even sing you poetry .
SINGING: I have no use for rings of gold . I care not for your poetry . I only want your hand to hold . I only want you near me .
GOBBER: C'mon , Hiccup !
SINGING: To love and kiss , to sweetly hold . For the dancing and the dreaming . Through all life 's sorrows and delights , I 'll keep your love inside me .
SINGING: I 'm still going Hiccup taps him .
HICCUP: Gobber !
GOBBER: I 'm done .
STOICK: Ah I thought I 'd have to die efore we 'd have that dance again .
VALKA: No need for drastic measures .
STOICK: For you , my dear anything .
VALKA: Yes ! Gobber pops his head in .
GOBBER: Great ! I 'll do the cooking ! They laugh .
STOICK: Thank Odin you did n't listen to me , son . We never would have found each other .
HICCUP: Toothless ?
STOICK: Val ! It 's all right , it 's all ight . We 're a team now .
BEAT: Now what do you want to do ? She glances from Hiccup to Stoick .
VALKA: We have to save the dragons .
DETERMINED: Aye . You got it ! He throws an arm around Hiccup .
DRAGO: Whatever comes , keep hitting the mountain ! We need to draw the alpha out .
TUFFNUT: Surprise ! Yeah !
ASTRID: You really are full of surprises . She leaps onto Stormfly , steadying them .
TUFFNUT: Dragon Riders coming through !
RUFFNUT: Eret , son of Eret !
ASTRID: Up , girl ! To the left , Eret ! That 's it ! Look out !
ARCHER: Take ` em down !
GOBBER: Heads up !
DRAGO: Dragon Master .
HICCUP: Welcome aboard , dragon rider !
ERET: Thanks . I think .
ASTRID: Where have you been ?
HICCUP: Oh , y'know . Catching up with Mom .
ERET: Whoa
ASTRID: That 's your mother ? !
HICCUP: Well , now you know where I get my dramatic flair .
DRAGO: The alpha ! Now we have a fight !
HICCUP: There ! Come on , Toothless ! Show them what you got , bud .
DRAGO: I 've waited a long time for this !
VALKA: You can not take our dragons ! They are controlled by the alpha !
SMUG: Then it 's a good thing I brought a challenger .
HORRIFIED: Another one ?
VALKA: No . No .
DRAGO: Come on ! Take down the alpha !
VALKA: Thank you .
STOICK: For you , my dear anything .
VALKA: I 'll do my best ! Come on , Cloudjumper !
DRAGO: You I watched you burn !
STOICK: It takes more than a little fire to kill me !
GOBBER: Stoick !
VALKA: No !
DRAGO: We 've won .
STOICK: No !
GOBBER: Right behind ya , Stoick !
HICCUP: STOP ! Stop !
DRAGO: This is the great dragon master ? The son of Stoick the Vast ? What shame he must feel .
HICCUP: All of this loss , and for what ? To ecome unstoppable ? To rule the world ? Drago smirks and turns away from Hiccup .
DRAGO: Or tear them apart .
HICCUP: Then why a dragon army ?
DRAGO: Well , you need dragons to conque other dragons .
HICCUP: Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people .
BEAT: To control those who follow you and to get rid of those who wo n't .
DRAGO: Clever boy .
HICCUP: The world wants peace . And we have the answer , back on Berk . Just let me show you .
DRAGO: NO ! Let ME show YOU .
STOICK: What ?
PANICKED: Hiccup !
GOBBER: Okay , change of plans . He hurries back down the mountain after them .
DRAGO: No dragon can resist the alpha 's command . So he who controls the alpha , controls them all .
HICCUP: Toothless ? You okay , bud ? What 's going on ?
DRAGO: Witness true strength . The strength of will over others . In the face of it , you are nothing .
HICCUP: Uh , what did he just tell you ?
STOICK: Hiccup !
VALKA: Stoick
HICCUP: No you
VALKA: It 's not his fault . You know that .
HICCUP: Toothless !
VALKA: No , do n't !
DRAGO: Move out !
HICCUP: I 'm sorry , Dad . He eyes the engulfed ship .
VALKA: You came early into this world . You were such a wee thing . So frail , so fragile . I feared you would n't make it .
BEAT: And he was right .
HICCUP: I was so afraid of becoming my dad . Mostly because I thought I neve could . How do you become someone that great ? That brave ? That selfless ?
BEAT: I guess you can only try . A chief protects his own . We 're going back .
TUFFNUT: Uh , with what ?
RUFFNUT: He took all the dragons .
HICCUP: Not all of them .
RUFFNUT: Fly straight !
FISHLEGS: I do n't want to die !
TUFFNUT: We ca n't fly these things !
FISHLEGS: Yeah , no kidding !
ASTRID: But wo n't that Bewilderbeast just take control of these guys , too ?
HICCUP: They 're babies . They do n't listen to anyone !
TUFFNUT: Yeah , just like us !
GOBBER: This is very dangerous ! He PULLS ALONGSIDE Hiccup and Valka .
HICCUP: Well , it 's a good thing that I never listen .
GOBBER: So what IS your plan ? !
HICCUP: Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-
GOBBER: Heads up !
HICCUP: And that thing . Gobber HITS it , with a THUD and a YELP .
HOARK: Ah , that 's a good boy !
DRAGO: Your chief is dead .
HICCUP: No
FISHLEGS: He took all the dragons !
FUMING: Distract the alpha . Try to keep his focus off of Toothless .
TUFFNUT: Uh how ?
ERET: Have you forgotten who you 're iding with ?
SNOTLOUT: Amateur .
VIKING #1: Look , it 's Hiccup ! The Vikings CHEER .
DRAGO: What ?
RUFFNUT: Keep ` em coming ! Snotlout tosses the black sheep to Tuffnut .
SNOTLOUT: Black sheep , baby !
FISHLEGS: I 'm okay !
DRAGO: You certainly are hard to get rid of . I 'll say that .
HICCUP: Toothless ? It 's me , bud . It 's me . I 'm right here . Come back to me .
DRAGO: He is not yours anymore . He belongs to the alpha !
HICCUP: It was n't your fault , bud . They made you do it .
BEAT: You 'd never hurt me .
DRAGO: How are you doing that ? Hiccup holds the stare , tears in his eyes .
HICCUP: Please . You are my best friend , ud . Bewilderbeast ROARS a forceful command .
DRAGO: No !
HICCUP: Yeah !
DRAGO: Do something !
HICCUP: We need to get those two apart .
ASTRID: Take them down , babe !
VALKA: Go get ` em .
DRAGO: Take control of it !
HICCUP: Shut it out , Toothless !
DRAGO: Agghh !
HICCUP: Hold him there Toothless ! Toothless SNARLS a warning , ready to blast .
GRINNING KNOWINGLY: Or is it ?
HICCUP: Oh , no !
VALKA: No ! No
HICCUP: He 's challenging the alpha !
VALKA: To protect you .
DRAGO: No , no , no , no ! Fight back ! Fight !
HICCUP: Now do you get it ? This is what it is to earn a dragon 's loyalty .
BEAT: Let this end now .
DRAGO: Never ! Come on !
HICCUP: The alpha protects them all .
ASTRID: Stormfly ! Stormfly bounds into Astrid .
GOBBER: Oh , give me a cuddle , Grumpy ! Grump lands ON TOP of Gobber , flattening him .
FISHLEGS: Who 's my little princess ?
SNOTLOUT: Do n't you ever leave again , Hookfang !
RUFFNUT: Oh Barf !
ERET: That was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there . You 'd make a good trapper .
HICCUP: Y'know , Skullcrusher 's gon na need somebody to look after him now .
ERET: Me ?
VALKA: Your father he 'd be every bit as proud as I am .
HICCUP: Thank you . I 'm really glad you 're here , Mom .
VALKA: And here I 'll stay .
ASTRID: See ? I told you it was in here .
HICCUP: Ha , ha . Still doing that one ? That 's hilarious .
THEN: Come here , you .
GOBBER: Ooh .

YOUNG GUARD: You 're kidding , Petey the Paint Thinner Killer is getting paroled ?
WISE GUARD: Not that slime , you Fizzhead . Hudson Hawk . The last of the great cat burglars .
WISE GUARD: As a thief , Hawk was a poem . Iambic fucking pentameter . You know , Crime used to have a little class . A hundred reporters were here when he came in , now they 're probably out covering some tired crack gang war
HAWK: Remind me to fire my publicist .

CESAR: You 're hitting Rutherford 's Auction House . Easy as my other 's wife . Directions are in the bag . Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie
HAWK: Or you cut off my thingie . Directions even your brothe would understand .
ANTONY: Yeah , directions even I could understand .
CESAR: Hawk , you 're a great thief . Got set up , did some time , nothing to e ashamed of . Do n't give me a sonata about you always just eally wanted to settle down , open a hardware Store and sell spatulas
HAWK: If the Mario brothers were n't Jersey 's third largest family , I 'd say kiss my ass . But considering your status , I 'll say slurp my butt .
CESAR: What 's your favorite sport , Hawk ?
HAWK: Baseball , why ?
CESAR: You need some time to think . That 's cool , but next time , I 'm not going to say `` Please . ''
HAWK: I do n't believe this . I 've been out forty seconds
ALEX: That 's the first thing I did . Smooch the ground and taste the freedom . Sorry I was late . Miss anything ?
HAWK: Your timing , and your shoes , are impeccable Good to see you , Alex , been having a lousy day .
ALEX: Lousy day ? The man 's getting out of prison and he 's having a lousy day . What , you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant ? Believe me , it 's overrated .
HAWK: Looks like you 've been expanding your
ALEX: Do n't say it , Hawkins . I 'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure .

HAWK: Not anymore . Now I 'm the laziest damn cat burgI 'm going to take it so straight that I wo n't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League .

HAWK: Come on , Alex , let 's just get to Alex 's . Your bar 's the only place that 's going to cheer me . God , I 'd kill for a damn cappuccino . What the hell 's a Nintendo ?
ALEX: Oh man , you still got a thing fo those unmasculine European coffees ? Who 's your buddy ? Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag .
HAWK: The man knows , the man knows !
ALEX: So Mr. Coffee , what went down outside the prison ?
HAWK: Oh , not much . Mario Brothers want me to do a job .
ALEX: Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I 'm Italian-wop motherfu
HAWK: Ah , had the perfect amount of foam . Just get me to the bar It 's the one good thing in my life that 'll never change .
ALEX: I did n't know how to tell you . A couple brokers stopped in fo Stoley Spritzers one night . Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us `` Watering Hole of the Month . '' Now , I 'm shopping fo Aqua Salmon wallpaper .
HAWK: I read about these people in Newsweek . Where 's all the egulars , Crazy Jeff Cava , the Todd sisters , Indian Joe ? Where 's Ed Kranepool 's autograph ? Captain Bob 's steering wheel ?
ALEX: Hey , get this irritable guy a cappuccino . I got ta go be a boss .
HAWK: This is Pizza ? Reindeer Goat cheese ? I admit , I 've been known to go wild and order a Canadian Bacon in my time , but..
GATES: Have a seat . Good to see you , uddy ol ' pal
HAWK: The pleasure 's all yours , Office Gates .
GATES: Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect ? Especially after I got you such a nice job .
HAWK: What job ?
GATES: The auction house , asshole . One night 's work and you 're free like no ex-con 's ever been . No checking in with a shrink , no community service teaching etards how to play air hockey . It 's a great deal , I ca n't lie .
HAWK: The only thing you ca n't do is get sex for free . I know I was in prison for like basically the 80 's , but , call me daffy , are n't you supposed to stop me from committing crimes . You know , Book-em-Dano , Call-for-backup , Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute .
GATES: You would n't be out if it was n't for me ! I did dog and pony fo you ! You think they would have let you out after what you did , you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges
HAWK: How was I supposed to know they were women ? Besides one of them was bald and kept saying `` Soitinly . ''
GATES: Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself ?
HAWK: Yes .
GATES: Remember that shoe you lost
HAWK: Uh , yeah . Cut to the chase .
GATES: One phone call and your shoe will become a piece of evidence and that suicide 'll become a murder . Hawk bobs under the table and up .
HAWK: What else do you got under there I do n't want to be rude , but this is all pretty lame .
GATES: That 's the beauty . It 's bullshit , ut I can make it stick because I 'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who 's about to find out that there 's a thin line etween ex-con and escape con . Alex suddenly approaches the table .
ALEX: How is everything tonight , sir ?
GATES: Beat it , Alex . You 're a dinosaur .

ALEX: Hell , the fall 'll probably kill ya Big Stan raises his gun .
GATES: Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor . How about a Gates-arita ? I used real hot dogs .
HAWK: Were n't you the bartender at Jonestown ?
CESAR: Good job , not pretty , but good .
HAWK: Ah , the mafia , the cops ; do I know how to party or what ? Gates pulls out the horse and looks at it .
GATES: All this trouble for a horsey . I may not know art , but I know what I like .
HAWK: You certainly do .
GATES: So when 's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here ?
ALFRED: Any minute now , dear Mr. Gates .
GATES: Oh , sorry Jeeves . Gates-arita ?
ALFRED: I 'll pass . May I ?

CESAR: Lovely work , Alfred , taking the Concorde back ?
ALFRED: Indeed I am , Mr. Mario . I 'm eally racking up those frequent flyer points
HAWK: I hate to interrrupt you two lovebirds
ANTONY: You know , I think Gates promised Hawk a cut , too .
ALFRED: Ta ta , Hudson Hawk .
HAWK: Too-do-loo , babe .
ALEX: Did I miss anything ?
HAWK: Oh , not much . Gates just had his tonsils taken out . The hard way .
ALEX: Geez , Gates was killed . Who do we send the thank you note to ?
HAWK: The Butler did it . Guy was a cross etween Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart . Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates 's head . He said it was made by , get this , Leonardo..
ALEX: Ah yes , a rare Renaissance piece . Da Vinci 's `` Sforza , '' an equestrian model of a never executed statue . I consider it to be the prize of tonight 's auction of objets d'equestrian . Horse things .
HAWK: Okay , you got me , Mr. PBS .
ALEX: Morning edition . Seems two thieves `` attempted '' to steal it last night , ut thanks to three `` courageous '' guards , it will be ready for tonight .
HAWK: `` Attempted . '' At-tempt-ted ! I 'm not happy about having to steal that horse , but I do have my pride . Face it , when it comes to urglary , and sex , I .
ALEX: Why try ?
HAWK: Because I 'm tired of not understanding things . Cops , Mafia , and butlers forcing me to ust my ass to steal something , which it turns out I really did n't stealit 's fucked up .
ALEX: You re not thinking of going to
HAWK: Alex , my man , it 's time to play a little offense . Where 's your tux ?
THE WOMAN: . the pretentious vultures who do n't even look up from thei calculators to see what they 're uying . Now that gives me goosebumps . Auctions are disgusting .
HAWK: I could n't agree more . Savages .
HAWK: Is looking like a constipated warthog a prerequisite to getting a job in the art world ?
ANNA: Some of us warthogs are more constipated than others .

DARWIN: Outbid by my own wench , quelle ummere .
MINERVA: Poor baby.. Here , Bunny .
ANNA: My God , that was bold of you , you did n't have to do that
HAWK: Forget about itit was nothing anybody would have done the same thingIt 's an impulse
ANNA: No , I meant you did n't have to tackle me and rip my dress . A polite push , perhaps ? A clea shout of `` watch out , Anna '' would have done nicely
HAWK: Excuse me , Milady . I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud , but I left my cape at the cleaners . Anna touches Hawk 's lips and laughs .
ANNA: Thanks tough guy , thanks a lot . Why was the guard chasing you ?
HAWK: Because Danger , Doc , is my middle
CESAR: News flash . You 're not in heaven . Yet . 30 seconds and counting , if you know what I 'm saying . Could n't just play along , could you
HAWK: Pretty class way of covering you tracks . I think that auctionee landed at La Guardia .
ANTONY: Subtlety was never one of ou strong points .
HAWK: Neither 's flossing .
HAWK: Life do n't get much better than this .
CESAR: Make him into Roadkill !
ANTONY: Yeah , run him down !
HAWK: This is the worst night
SNICKERS: When it rains , it pours . Name 's Snickers . The plane leaves in 40 .
ALMOND JOY: Almond Joy . I know , pretty silly . But it 's better than when we first started out , our code names were Diseases . You do n't know what it 's like being called Clymidia for a year . Whoops , forgot .
BUTTERFINGER: My name 's Butterfinger .
HAWK: No shit .
KAPLAN: Do n't you just hate kids
ALMOND JOY: George , you promised . No Old CIA New CIA jokes
KAPLAN: I call them the MTV.I.A . Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea . They think the Cold War involves penguins and
HAWK: Do n't I know you
KAPLAN: You just might . I 'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it . At the time , I was bald with a beard , no moustache , and I had a different nose , so if you do n't recognize me , I wo n't be offended .
HAWK: Bastard , you 're going to need another nose !
KAPLAN: I used you as a diversion . while you were getting captured upstairs , I was shredding documents in the asement . Deep down , I guess I was just jealous . You were one incredible thief
HAWK: To what do I owe the dishonor of a eunion , you centrally intelligent scumsicle .
KAPLAN: I Want to make things up to you . That 's why I got you this gig , doll . Hawk , my name 's George Kaplan and to quote the late , great Karen Carpenter , `` We 've only just begun . ''
HAWK: Three minutes , twenty-three seconds . If you think I 'm doing another
KAPLAN: Hush . My employer wants a meeting .
HAWK: Employer ? The president ?
KAPLAN: No , somebody powerful . Oh . Look . what 's that up there ?
HAWK: I 'm supposed to fall for that ?
KAPLAN: Shucks . Guess not .
HAWK: No . Way .
ALFRED: Welcome to Rome , sir .
HAWK: Yes way .
DARWIN: For those kind of wages , I could have built the factory in America ! They 're Vietnamese , ca n't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts ? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide ! Alfred , hold my calls . So , Hawk ! The Hawkster ! What do you think of the vehicle ?
HAWK: You could host American Bandstand in here . Why did you duck at the auction , asshole ?
DARWIN: Because I did n't want to get hurt , taterhead .
HAWK: My life is not some deal . I
DARWIN: I 'm sorry , I have to take this . Those are valid points though
HAWK: Whatever . You own Boardwalk , you own Park Place , you own the fou ailroads . You think you 're God . For all I know , you 're probably ight . I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino , maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is . Man , why did n't you just buy < /u the horse ? What am I saying , you did buy it
DARWIN: Oh Let 's see . There are organizations that think we wanted the `` Sforza '' for reasons othe than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we 're building in Vinci . Hopefully , these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica . If I seem vague , grand . We want a low profile on this , that 's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved . I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out .
HAWK: If you 're pausing for a `` thank you , '' give it up . So boss , you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means ?
DARWIN: Way to go , Alfie ! How many people did you break that thing in front of . Good help 's hard to find .
HAWK: I guess that 's a no .
DARWIN: Ladies and gentlemen of the board
MINERVA: HelloBunny , Ball-Ball !
DARWIN: Hawkmeister , we got you clothes , great hotel , and a 250,000 lira per diem .
MINERVA: That 's two hundred dollars a day ? So he can get a hooker and some tequila . Veto , Darwin .
HAWK: Guess I know who wears the penis in this family .
MINERVA: For God 's sake , chain this convict .
HAWK: Alfred , you 're a very polite psychopath , but if you
MINERVA: We want Da Vinci 's sketchbook , what do they call it , the Codex .
DARWIN: Listen Hawk , this might be hard to elieve , but I 'm a regular joe . I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals . It 's just when you make your first illion by the age of 19 , it 's hard to keep coming up with new ones . But now finally I got my new goal . World domination . With your helpBunny.quit that !
MINERVA: Bunny , ball-ball ! Bad bunny !
HAWK: Think he 's already got today 's all-balls . Five more minutes please , it 's been so long Minerva yanks away the yelping dog .
MINERVA: You go back , you wo n't be alone . You 'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate . You 're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes , ut `` Alex '' will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it 'll be to attend his own funeral . Depressing .
HAWK: You would n't risk the dime to call the police . You have no proof .
DARWIN: Ah , the magic word
MINERVA: Tomorrow , you 're going to hit a church .
HAWK: I 'm robbing the Vatican . The nuns at St. Agnes predicted that I 'd end up doing this
VATICAN GUARD: `` You 're being '' ..uh , I do n't , uh
HAWK: Forget it , man . Go tackle a jaywalker .
ANNA: Tough guy . What are youHow 's your head .
HAWK: Yes , and my giraffe loves it , too She laughs , going into her public voice .
ANNA: As you know , the Da Vinci Codex , has lived in the Vatican fo centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more .
HAWK: That 's what you theenk .
ANNA: Question , sir ? His untiring pen predicted the airplane , the submarine , the bicycle , the helicopter , and even the tank .
LITTLE BRAT: This is so bor-ing ! Do you hate Italy as much as I do , Pokey ? Si , senor ! Italy sucks the big one ! why ca n't we go to the Epcot Center !
ANNA: These more dangerous designs inspired him to develop a secret code that .
LITTLE BRAT: Pokey , come back !
ANNA: Come on , this stuff will knock you out . Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed , Mr . Bond .
HAWK: Never , why do you ask ?
ANNA: Sure Hudson . Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo ?
HAWK: Could you believe that crazy elephant ?
ANNA: Delivers up to ten at night . The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals . It 's actually not that an unusual set-up . The secret passageway on the othe hand .
HAWK: The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed , not explained .
ANNA: Nice . But right out of ou ochure .
HAWK: Oh , you read that .
ANNA: Actually I wrote it . It 's a good sentence . It can apply to people .
HAWK: You 're not an unmysterious thang yourself .
ANNA: I do n't steal stuffed elephants from little girls . And I buy my own clothes . My life 's a little boring
HAWK: God , I wish I could say the same thing . What about having a nice , dull dinner with me tonight . Scrabble , Knock-knock jokes , Anecdotes about famous dead Italians .
ANNA: I 'll bring my entire repertoire
HAWK: And I 'll bring my entourage
ANNA: Secret passageways do n't mean as much as they used to . There 's a place two blocks east of here . Enzo 's . Say 10 30 .
HAWK: Said .
ANNA: Father , it 's obvious . He 's up to something .
CARDINAL: Did he mention the Mayflowers ?
ANNA: No , your Eminence . I think he 's going to steal the Codex , as early as next week .
CARDINAL: Attempt , you mean . The vanity of this man , Hudson Hawk . The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists . We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey . Must you flirt with him so realistically ?
ANNA: That 's the best kind . A wise woman once said `` Polite conversation is rarely either . ''
CARDINAL: Let me be the one to quote Scripture . .As an agent of our organization , you are put in awkward situations . Just emember , Hudson Hawk is an evil , evil man .
ANNA: Yeah . The big E .
HAWK: Hello , operator . I 'd like to make a collect call to New York number
KAPLAN: Hawk , Hawk , Hawk . Enjoying Italy ? I always had a soft spot for Rome . Did my first barehanded strangulation here . Communist politician .
HAWK: Why George , you big softie
KAPLAN: God , I miss communism . The Red Threat . People were scared , the Agency was respected , and I got laid every night .
BUTTERFINGER: Sorry , coach
KAPLAN: If his father was n't the head of Shit , I hate this , the government 's got me farmed out , working for the Mayflowe corporation now , money beats politics . War is n't Hell anymore , it 's Dull . Do n't slaughter thei men and rape their women , just steal their microchips .
HAWK: You know Kaplan , if you were n't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived , I 'd feel sorry fo you .
SNICKERS: Good news , bud , the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table . You 're hitting the Vatican to-night .
HAWK: Tonight ? You 're whacked . The timing 's off , I 'm underequipped Damnit , I have a date !
ALMOND JOY: Grapple , Biker 's bottle , hairspray , lack turtleneck , Pocket Fisherman , acid , collapsible yardstick , softball , and 72 stamps . Gee Stud , this is going to be some date . No Harvey 's Bristol Cream ?
KAPLAN: Snickers , make the list happen . Oh and it 's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower 's pathetic staff , but we 're sore losers . I 've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty .
HAWK: Thanks for sharing .
KAPLAN: We blow up space shuttles fo eakfast . You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit .
HAWK: If you do anything to my friend
KAPLAN: Yeah , right . By the way , as long as I 'm getting things off my chest , I 'm the one who killed you little monkey . Made it look like a Mafia hit . Did it for fun . Ciao .
HAWK: What did you have against Little Eddie , motherfucker ? He was just a monkey who liked to laugh . Come back without your yuppie army . I 'll triscuit you , you space shuttle eatingShit . !
BUTTERFINGER: Hey , Mr. Hawk , I got those 72 stamps !
HAWK: `` Beware the Odd Steps . ''
VATICAN GUARD: The worm 's on the other foot , yankee noodle candy .
ANNA: Oh Hudson , I was worried you were n't going to drop by .
HAWK: I never break a date . Scout 's honor .
WAITER: Bellissimo , signor .
HAWK: Oh , and could I have some ketchup with that .
SNICKERS: Come on , Pierre , Steak-bur-ger , Fren-n-ch Fries . This is France , you got ta have French..
ALMOND JOY: Actually we 're in Italy , Snickers , she said as if it made a difference .
SNICKERS: Italy , France , Moscow . They all just wan na be Nebraska . Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead , we got nothing to do . Man , Democracy is n't free elections . We got ta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits , College Football on Saturdays , Eddie Murphy saying the word `` Fuck '' and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on `` America 's Funniest Home Videos . ''
ALMOND JOY: Damn baby , when 's the last time you had a vacationJesus , I got ta get out of this job . If my Mom knew her daughte assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement .
SNICKERS: Quit bitching , you got the employee of the month plaque fo that shitAh to be in Pari-is and in love . They look off to .
HAWK: This is bueno . They had the worst ketchup in prison..uh
ANNA: Prison ?
HAWK: I was the Warden ?
ANNA: How long were you in ?
HAWK: Let 's just say , I never saw E.T .
ANNA: Wow , you were `` in the joint . '' `` Doing hard time . '' It 's funny , ut that excites me . I seem to have a thing for sinners .
HAWK: I seem to have a thing for sinning . sinning . Check please .
WAITER: Ah , anything for dessert ?
ANNA: Yes . Something to go .
HAWK: I 'll bring the ketchup .
ANNA: What have you been doing ?
HAWK: Uh.old badminton injury .
ANNA: Oh , I 'm so sorry
HAWK: Hey now , outside of a very friendly dog this morning , it 's een a slow decade . I do n't make love every ten years , I get a little cranky .
ANNA: It 's also been a long time fo me . I
HAWK: Catholic girls are scary
ANNA: Somebody robbed the Vatican .
HAWK: Oh . No .
ANNA: You really went and did it . With one day , not even a day , of planning , you did it . Nobody does it better , Hudson . You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex .
HAWK: Wha
ANNA: What are your plans for the weekend ? Hoisting away the Colosseum ? Tell me , did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower ?
SNICKERS: What 's going on in there ?
BUTTERFINGER: Do you want me to rape them ? Dunkin does it better .
SNICKERS: Just read , Butterfinger .
BUTTERFINGER: `` Da Vinci had fears about his more dangerous designs , so he created a shorthand code in everse script ''
ALMOND JOY: To yourself ! ..What are they doing ? In twenty seconds , we go in .
ANNA: For two years , I 've been tracking the Mayflowers ' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces . Thei Sforza replica was as fake as the `` gas leak '' that supposedly destroyed it .
HAWK: Does everyone in the world know more than me ? Jesus , I 'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff..Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half . Who knew it would lead They even got the CIA involved !
ANNA: The C.I . what ? God , no
HAWK: Ooh , I guess I do know something Here 's looking at you , kid
ALMOND JOY: Now .
HAWK: This does n't taste like cappuccino .
ANNA: Oh , I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it .
ALMOND JOY: That 's not overly possible . He
BUTTERFINGER: But guys , remember , he 's in the castle at Vinci .
KAPLAN: Way to go , Anna .
ANNA: When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex , they 're going to want to make a deal
KAPLAN: And then we 'll arrest those greedy pigs Is that it ? Hawk stirs . The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V .
ANNA: Actually George , it 's not it . What are we doing in this castle ? I happen to know the Mayflowers ought this castle last year when they found out Da Vinci used to do
KAPLAN: It 's the site of their new museum and we 're taking it over . Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead .
ANNA: Oh Lord . the only reason I ask is that Hudson , uh , Mr. Hawk , Hawkins , had some `` neat '' things to say about Darwin , Minerva , and you . Basically that you 're part of the same car pool .
KAPLAN: Anna . Anna . Anna . If that were true , Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex . Now , get some sleep . Kit Kat
ANNA: Cat got his tongue ?
KAPLAN: Actually he never told us what it was .
ANNA: How sweet . I trust you will see Hudson Hawk is given to the prope authorities . I recommend leniency
SNICKERS: Oh , I think we all do .
KAPLAN: I do n't think so , although bringing her to the castle gave her a big , juicy hint .
ALMOND JOY: With all due respect to that great louse , why did n't I cut out he heart ?
KAPLAN: Close call , but she 's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization . Hawk , it 's time to go to the principal 's office .
DARWIN: Seven !
ALFRED: Jolly . Good . Shot . Sir .
MINERVA: Ooh , it 's Hudson Hawk , you cease to amaze me , convict . You are a u > terrible cat burglar !
DARWIN: Have n't you ever seen , like David Niven ? You know tiptoe in , tiptoe out .
MINERVA: Like a `` cat '' , one could say .
HAWK: Shucks , I 'll just take it back .
MINERVA: No , let me !
DARWIN: I do n't care .
HAWK: Another piece of the puzzle fo the Da Vinci Alchemy project .
DARWIN: Oh , you . There 's nothing more I hate than failure . All you had to do was follow the Hawk , it 's not like I said `` Teach our nation 's children how to read . ''
MINERVA: Get away from there , convict !
HAWK: Just browsing . Do n't touch me .
DARWIN: Do n't hurt him ! We need him fo the final job !
HAWK: Oh weeeeelly , do n't hurt me ? Even if I do this .
KAPLAN: That 's it !
HAWK: Things are getting a little loose at the Da Vinci workshop tonight . `` Put your left leg in , take you ight foot out . '' May I call you Minnie .
DARWIN: Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you wo n't need fo your next job
HAWK: Hey , guys , I 've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons , ut come on .
MINERVA: Big girls do n't cry-I-eye .
HAWK: Two minutes , 35 seconds . Damnit , I 'm involved in this thing , so I just wan na know what this thing is . I wan na be treated as an adult .
DARWIN: That 's fair . Tomorrow . Back in Rome . Now go to your room .
ANNA: Forgive me Father for I have sinned . It 's been 1200 hours since my last confession .
CARDINAL: Hit me with your best shot .
ANNA: He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure . But he knew Right and Wrong . Oh , and we kind of messed around
CARDINAL: `` Messed around '' messed around ? I know I do n't want to know . First ase ? Second Base ? Stop me when I 'm getting warm
ANNA: You got it . Operation Deflowe Mayflower is a bad joke and I 'm the punchline . I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower , ut really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower .
CARDINAL: Oh , why could n't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering . If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci 's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine Aie-yiDo we got anything ? What of Alex , Hawk 's friend , where is his loyalty ?
ANNA: I 'm going to find out .
CARDINAL: I 'm sorry for losing it back there , ut you must remember , sister , you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world .
ANNA: I know , I know , your Eminence , just say `` God go with me . ''
CARDINAL: God go with you , sister .
DARWIN: So , Captain Hawk , in one of you paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou . In the autre , you got lead that wo n't get you gelato .
MINERVA: Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference .
HAWK: That 's two down to Kitty Carlisle
MINERVA: Cool , is n't it ? Weight , feel , mal1eability , they 're all but identical . On the periodic chart of elements , they 're but one proton apart . Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless .
HAWK: Alchemy .
DARWIN: Alchemy ! Is the business term of the 90 's , my man ! Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago . I dumped some lira into research Shazam , we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci 's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro , the gold machine for those at home , and the rest is about to become history . Money is n't everything , gold is . Fuck lue chip stocks ! Fuck T-bills ! Fuck Junk Bonds ! I got the real deal ! Money will always be pape ut gold will always be gold !
MINERVA: Market crashes . Bomb drops . Greenhouse effect affects . We 'll still be the richest , most powerful people in the world . In 1992 , Europe is coming together to become one business superpower . It 's one party we 'd love to poop .
DARWIN: Well , that said , the last ingredient in the recipe is in , get this , you 're gon na die , the Kremlin .
HAWK: Sure . The Kremlin . Makes sense . The Kremlin . Why not ? Listen , this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me , man . Throw me in jail and go ahead , just try and throw Alex
MINERVA: Jail , you asshole ! Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out ! Bunny , Ball-Ball !
DARWIN: I 'll torture you so slowly you 'll think it 's a career ! I 'll kill your family , your friends , and the itch you took to the Prom !
HAWK: You want an address on that last one ? Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger .
MINERVA: You 've got a dilemma , tiger . I think I know what 's going to help you solve it .
HAWK: I 'll kill all you . Even the old lady .
ALEX: I hated cigarettes until I saw my first No Smoking sign . Keep off the Grass ? Let 's play Soccer . Only law I cared about was friendship . Broke that one too , did n't I ? This Gates-Mario Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci thing seemed like a sweet deal . Visit foreign lands , take thei treasures . I do n't know , I thought you 'd get into it . It 's bette than playing darts with M.B.A. 's at the bar . I did n't know it was going to be like this . Them using me to use you I 'm sorry , there 's only one way out of this and it 's gon na hurt me more than it 's gon na hurt you .
KAPLAN: I just do n't think it was a smoking hot idea to leave them up there alone .
MINERVA: Do n't worry George , this is the eason we put the old diabetic guinea on the payroll to begin with . To keep Hawk in line . They 'll talk about `` being buddies '' and `` chugging brewskis . ''
DARWIN: You got ta love male bonding .
KAPLAN: You were saying
HAWK: You bastard ! You fucked my freedom for a lousy job !
ALEX: Hawk I 'm so sorry
HAWK: No..Alex ! Wake up , you ca n't go out like this .
MINERVA: Plan B , anyone
ANNA: Oh thank God , you 're dead
ALEX: It was so beautiful ! When the lanks went off , they
HAWK: You bastard . You fucked my freedom for a lousy job .
ALEX: But I said I was sorry .
HAWK: No sweat , Alex , you only made the iggest mistake of my life . What was your per-diem ?
ALEX: Do n't act like you 've never committed a crime before , Hawkins ? I know , I made call , when Anna tracked me down I
ANNA: Hudson , do n't you understand
HAWK: And you , Dr. Cappucino , you 're lucky I do n't hit women , assuming you are a woman . I 'm not taking anything fo granted anymore .
ANNA: I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization . The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me . I-care-for-you
HAWK: Oh . Well , what 's this ?
ANNA: Where did you get this ?
HAWK: You know , the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex . the Mayflower Museum .
ANNA: It 's from the machine . All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already . We ca n't let that happen .
ALEX: You 're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray .
ANNA: Something like that .
ALEX: Well , forget about it . Hawk and I are going to Rio . We 're hurt , we 're tired , and a hero ai n't nothing but a sandwich . Right , uddy ?
ANNA: Hudson , God 's given you a gift fo cat burglary , you can t just
HAWK: You better believe I can . I 'm sick of people telling me what I have to do .
ANNA: It 's that kind of selfish attitude that
HAWK: Selfish attitude ? I 'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up , not too much foam
ANNA: You re not `` some guy '' anymore , Hudson . Right now , you 're the only guy . Without your help , I .
HAWK: The world is beautiful . Every day in prison I made sure to remembe that . It 's only when I actually got out that I forgot . If I was sane , I 'd be on that plane to Rio . But being beaten and abused to fulfill some corporation 's perverted vision does something to your mental health . The world is eautiful and I 'm tired of being fucked . It 's Darwin and Minerva 's turn to ite the pillow
ANNA: That was beautiful .
ALEX: I laughed , I cried .
HAWK: Rio , Alex ? After all they 've done toHey , these tickets are for Moscow !
ALEX: Damn travel agency . That Kremlin thing is in Moscow , is n't it ?
ANNA: Ketchup . Stupido Americani
KAPLAN: We 're all family now . My team has done a lot of rougher things than steal the model of a helicopter .
SNICKERS: We 're going to whack this place so fast we 'll have time to shop for American imports .
ALMOND JOY: Lucky for us , the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff . It 'll have the least number of guards .
KAPLAN: As for our plan of action , anybody 'd be insane to go in from the ground floor
ALEX: We 're going in from the ground floor .
HAWK: Geez , this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm .
ANNA: Uh , yeah . Guess I 'm a wee bit nervous . I 'm sorry I could only score clergy passports .
HAWK: Fits my new image . A thief fo the masses . This is one job I 'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying . Gum .
ALEX: The security 's actually not that severe .
ANNA: It does n't have to be . Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin , you 'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails .
HAWK: Shwoof , that makes me feel better . I ca n't believe this is the Iron Curtain . All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was `` Who Shot J.R. ? ''
ALEX: You sound disappointed .
HAWK: Yeah , I mean , come on , going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire , it 's supposed to be strangling a guard
SNICKERS: We are the blue light . The green light is where the Art Treasures oom is .
KAPLAN: Let 's go make a purple light . Where 's Kit Kat ?
ALEX: Delivery Entrance . Low Security .
ANNA: Gum . All three spit out their gum into Hawk 's bag .
HAWK: Count of three ?
ALEX: Why not just go now ?
HAWK: Okay . The Trio rush for the door .
KAPLAN: Everything 's going fine , Minerva , thanks for asking
MINERVA: I say who needs this Hudson Hawk anyway .
HAWK: Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh .
MINERVA: Everybody here , in Rome , wishes you tinsel boxes of love
KAPLAN: Lazy , rich , condescending bitch .
ALEX: Eighth room down , babe
ANNA: Guards come exactly every three minutes .
HAWK: Three . Oh . Oh . `` Side by Side . '' Our trio charges down the hallway .
ALEX: `` Maybe we 're ragged and funny . ''
KAPLAN: Create a diversion .
ALEX: Now that 's a lock .
HAWK: Do n't worry , we 'll get it
ANNA: Can I sing this time , too ? Please ?
HAWK: Uh , I guess so .
DARWIN: I look at you Soviet people and I feel pity superiority . Most of your life , your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who 'd rathe eat microwave sushi , naked in the ack of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children .
MINERVA: We 're here to say , your government was right .
DARWIN: So let 's get busy . Have some fun and make some deals .
HAWK: `` Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt ''
ALEX: `` How 'd we ever get such in a ru-utt ''
ANNA: `` But we 'll travel the road , Sharing the load . Side by Side ! ''
SNICKERS: This is the room above the Art Treasures room . The lock is a Natalya Z-Z , first created
ALMOND JOY: Snickers , baby , I love you like a other , but really , who cares ? Silencer bomb
HAWK: That was close .
ALEX: Anna , I think you better stay .
HAWK: You can be lookout ! .. Take Alex 's gun .
ANNA: `` You can be the lookout . ''
SOVIET LEADER: Before we serve you `` the main course , '' hee , hee , we need to know specifics about what you can do for us . We
DARWIN: Bluntness . How amusingly Hungarian . Listen up , for reasons I do n't want to get into , I recently had to close down a petroleum factory , but I 'm going to re-build it here and Madonna 's going to cut the ribbon ! Frozen burritos in Leningrad . 1982 fantasy . 1992 reality .
HAWK: `` We all had our quarrels and parted ''
ALEX: `` But we 'll be the same as we started
HAWK: Geez , this place is a mess
ALEX: Voila
ALMOND JOY: What the hell .
SNICKERS: You 're supposed to be dead !
ALEX: I 'm a ghost . Boo .
HAWK: I do n't want to sound immature , ut we were here first
KAPLAN: I wish I could think of those cute quips the way you can , Hawk , but I ca n't , so I 'll just shoot Alex .
HAWK: No .
ALMOND JOY: That was pretty uncool , George
KAPLAN: Sorry , you know he kind of reminds me of Little Eddie . But I digress . Ah , victory is so sweet .
MINERVA: Yum . This is the best meal I ever had
KAPLAN: Damnit , this is n't the plan ! Blue light , green light , shit ! Snickers , Kit Kat , A.J. , scramble , see if you can find out anything .
HAWK: Ca n't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you
KAPLAN: They may be scum , but if I get the Da Vinci model back , then we 'll be oasting weenies on the beach .
HAWK: I do n't think you 'll appreciate their choice of weenie . Kaplan raises his gun .
DARWIN: You 're helping us achieve a goal and in return , I 'm giving you a key to the world 's executive washroom . Do n't piss it away . Skoal , amigos
ANNA: You people are immoral and narcissitic and I wo n't let you
KAPLAN: I ca n't believe this . I 'm in fucking Russia , or do I have to say , the fucking Soviet Union and I 'm shooting a non-Bolshevick . I never thought I 'd say `` I 'm just in this job for the money . '' Sad . Any last immature quips ?
HAWK: No . But why do you let Butterfinge keep those blood stains on his shirt ?
BUTTERFINGER: What blood stains .
HAWK: You want immature , how 'bout an egg fight
ALEX: I ca n't believe you did n't notice . My weight . I lost ten pounds in Rome
HAWK: You 're a reed , man . I got ta get Anna . Hang in there
ALMOND JOY: Anna-bannana-fo-fanna , I guess I have to cut out your heart fo eal now . It 's not personal .
ANNA: The Mayflowers got
DARWIN: What a pleasant surprise . You 're probably wondering
HAWK: But you 're going to tell us anyway
MINERVA: I hate a man with a sense of humor . While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of you masculinity , we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way a thoroughly corrupt business deal .
HAWK: If you think you 're getting past me
SNICKERS: Bastard ! If you were a true American .
HAWK: Just shut up and hit me !
HAWK: Damnit , I hate this ! I 'm a cat urglar ! Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit .
SNICKERS: Too bad .
MINERVA: I knew it ! I told you it was a fake .
DARWIN: That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch . What was our bet ? A million ?
MINERVA: Million five , lover
SNICKERS: Help me you Democratic Reform lovers ! Get a screwdriver , you Stupid Eskimoes ! Screw-dri-ver ! Oh God , I always wanted to know how to play the harp , there just was so little time ! Rosebud !
ALEX: Get 'em . They went down the hallway .
HAWK: Let 's just forget it , I mean
ALEX: Get em .
MINERVA: Alex . How 's it going ?
ALEX: Go , go to Hell , to Hell .
MINERVA: Where 's your insulin.No ? Well , Bon Appetite .
HAWK: Oh , come on .
MINERVA: Very good , Alex , but you re still alive .
HAWK: Why does this have to be so hard
KAPLAN: Tell me about it
HAWK: Take this to Hell with you Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp .
KAPLAN: My pension..
DARWIN: God-damnit , I only wanted to destroy the world in my own image . I 'm a regular Joe
HAWK: Wow , this is really gon na hurt the esale value
HAWK: Oh , honey .
ANNA: Oh Hudson
HAWK: I told you not to call me Hudson . The only people who called me that were the nuns at
ANNA: Oh Hudson , I 'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent .
HAWK: This is too bad to be false .
ALFRED: Welcome back to Vinci .
HAWK: Last rites , sister ?
ANNA: Please , no nun jokesThey 're a ad habit to get into.get it ?
HAWK: She killed Alex . Alfred gives them a push .
MINERVA: Sorry , I could n't resist . You 're probably wondering why you 're still alive . Anna..
HAWK: You killed a friend . Why should I help you go for the gold ?
MINERVA: It 'll take a couple of years of steady production , but I 'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself , the foundation of all finance , will lose its meaning . Brokers , economists , and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous eakdowns . Markets will crash- crash . Financial Empires will crumble-crumble .
HAWK: Except yours-yours . The goal of world domination . Well , if you put it that way , Minnie . How can I resist ?
MINERVA: You ca n't , convict ! You 're just a shmoe ! Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them . It rains , car crash stops traffic , you say `` How could this happen to me ? '' It 's a natural inclination . But for I , this is n't a fantasy , it is reality ! You are on my planet ! You walk around the corner for coffee , out of my sight , you do not fucking exist ! The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich , to the powerful , to ME !
ANNA: Do it . There 's no reason to fight anymore . She 's a force of nature .
MINERVA: If you pull this off , I ca n't promise I wo n't kill you . I mean , who we trying to kid ? But I will spare the Flying Nun here .
HAWK: And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps .
MINERVA: I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic , but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind , gentle lover . So do n't play with me .
HAWK: Okay , fine !
MINERVA: Oh Hawk , do n't ever change . Go , team , go !
HAWK: I hope you know what .
ANNA: Trust Leonardo .
HAWK: Wha.. Anna puts her fingers on his lips .
MINERVA: We 're for real .
HAWK: Yeah , but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal .
ANNA: Wha you do n't want to know Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket .
HAWK: I wan na know
ANNA: Holy sh-hthings are going to get very interesting , very fast . Da Vinci would be proud of you .
HAWK: Me , Anna , and Leonardo just wan na say you got the Midas touch , baby
ALFRED: How .
HAWK: You 're unemployed , Alfie . Boss is dead . Her plan is over .
ALFRED: My plan is just beginning . I 'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my oorish employers , but I 'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses !
HAWK: Ooh-kay
ANNA: Sorry !
HAWK: Stop helping me ! Thou shalt not kill !
ANNA: Allow me .
HAWK: Oh Bunny , Ball-Ball .
JUGGLER: Che pazzo .
HAWK: Have I ever told you the world is eautiful I 'd really like to play Nintendo with you , or something
ANNA: Hudson , I 'm afraid I 'm sticking with God . But you 're a close second , tough guy . What is that smile ?
HAWK: I got my planet back .
EXECUTIVE: So in the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening . We 're up 18 percent over last year 's third quarte gross and , needless to say , that 's a new record
EXECUTIVE: The competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack . Market share in most divisions is increasing and we 've opened seven new regional offices
EXECUTIVE: Our international division has also shown vigorous upward movement in the past six months and we 're looking at some exciting things in
EXECUTIVE: The news in the money market is n't good it 's excellent
EXECUTIVE: we 're loaded .
HUDSUCKER: Ahem
EXECUTIVE: Mr. Hudsucker ?
HUDSUCKER: Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
HUDSUCKER: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh
MUSSBURGER: Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo .
AN EXECUTIVE: He could 've opened the window .
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way .
ADDISON: My God , why ? ! Why did he do it ? ! Things were going so well !
MUSSBURGER: What am I a headshrinker ? Maybe the man was unhappy .
ADDISON: He did n't look unhappy !
EXECUTIVE: Yeah , well , he did n't look rich .
ELDERY EXECUTIVE: Waring Hudsucker was never an easy man to figure out . He built this company with his bare hands . Every step he took was a step up . Except of course this last one .
MUSSBURGER: Sure , sure , he was a swell guy , but when the president , chairman of the oard and holder of eighty-seven percent of the company 's stock drops forty-four floors
PRECISE EXECUTIVE: Forty-five
ELDERY EXECUTIVE: Counting the mezzanine
MUSSBURGER: Then the company has a problem . Stillson , what exactly is the disposition of Waring 's stock ?
STILLSON: Well , as you know , Hud left no will and had no family . The company bylaws are quite clear in that event . His entire portfolio will be converted to common stock and will be sold over the counter as of the first of the fiscal year following his demise .
MUSSBURGER: Meaning ?
STILLSON: Meaning simply that Waring 's stock , and control of the company , will be available to the public on January first .
MUSSBURGER: You mean to tell me that any slob in a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock ? Stillson shrugs .
STILLSON: The company bylaws are quite clear .
ADDISON: My God ! You 're animals ! How can you discuss his stock when the man has just leapt forty-five floors
PRECISE EXECUTIVE: Forty-four
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: Not counting the mezzanine .
MUSSBURGER: Quit showboating , Addison , the man is gone . The question now is whethe we 're going to let John Q . Public waltz in and buy 87 percent of ou company .
STILLSON: January first .
AN EXECUTIVE: Thirty days .
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE: Four weeks .
ADDISON: A month at the most .
MUSSBURGER: One month to make the blue-chip investment of the century look like a round-trip ticket on the Titanic .
AN EXECUTIVE: We play up the fact that Hud is dead .
ALL: Long live the Hud ! !
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE: We depress the stock
PRECISE EXECUTIVE: Fifty-one .
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: Not counting the mezzanine .
CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE: It could work .
OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE: It should work .
PRACTICAL EXECUTIVE: It would work .
MUSSBURGER: It 's working already . Waring Hudsucke is abstract art on Madison Avenue . All we need now is a new president who will inspire real panic in ou stockholders .
ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE: Yeah , a puppet !
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE: A proxy !
MUSSBURGER: Sure , sure . Some jerk we can really push around .

Hell , I 'd even train my poodle with it if he was n't a French poodle and more partial to the pages of Paree Soir ! But I sure would n't shell out a hard-earned nickel to read the dadblamed thing !
REPORTER: Come on , chief , give us a break .
EDITOR: Suuuure , Tibbs , take a break ! Go to Florida ! Lie in the sun ! Wait for a coconut to drop , file a story on it it 'll be more of a grabber than you piece on the commie grain surplus !

REPORTER #3: Everybody has parents .
EDITOR: All right , how many ? How 'bout it , Parkinson , you 've been awful quiet over there .
PARKINSON: Uhhh
EDITOR: The only thing that runs deep with Parkinson is the holes in his ears . Yes , the Idea Man ! What 're his hopes and dreams , his desires and aspirations ? Does he think all the time or does he set aside a certain portion of the day ? How tall is he and what 's his shoe size ? Where does he sleep and what does he eat fo eakfast ? Does he put jam on his toast or does n't he put jam on his toast , and if not why not and since when ? He thrust his face into that of the Reporter .
AMY: I tell ya the guy 's a phony .
EDITOR: Phony , huh ?
AMY: As a three-dollar bill .
EDITOR: Sez who ?
AMY: Sez me ! Amy Archer . Why is he an Idea Man because Hudsucker says he is ? What 're his ideas ? Why wo n't they let anyone interview him ?
REPORTER: Five bucks says she mentions he Pulitzer .
OTHER REPORTER: Again ? You 're on .

BUZZ: My pleasure , sir .
NORVILLE: Roast tom turkey . Gee , I 'm hungry too
MUSSBURGER: Sure , sure The elevator doors open .
BUZZ: It 's been a pleasure serving you , Mr. Mussburger .
NORVILLE: Say , Mr. Muss uh , Sid ! Should n't we be a little bit concerned with the downward spiral of our stock these last few days ? I mean , you 're the expert , but at the Muncie College of Business Administration they told us
MUSSBURGER: Relax , Norville . It 's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover .
NORVILLE: Okay , Sid . Like I said , you 're the expert , but
MUSSBURGER: I do remember and I was impressed . Anyway , that 's all forgotten now . Driver !
NORVILLE: Thank you , Sid , but the reason I mention it is , it would require such a small capital investment again , you 're the expert here
MUSSBURGER: Damnit , where 's my car !
NORVILLE: But there 's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics baby boom discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class A black limousine pulls up to the curb .
MUSSBURGER: Finally .
NORVILLE: So if you think it 's appropriate , I 'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch Mussburger is getting into the back seat
MUSSBURGER: Sure , sure , tell whoever you want
NORVILLE: But , Sid , I thought you and I were
DOORMAN: Say , bud , could you keep the sidewalk clear here ?
NORVILLE: But I 'm the president of this aww , forget it .
WAITRESS: Can I get you boys anything else ?
VETERAN #1: Bromo . Beat .
VETERAN #2: Bromo .
AMY: I 'm sorry we had to take the stairs . It was just that horrible little elevator boy
NORVILLE: Not at all . You 're light as a feather .
AMY: The couch , please .
NORVILLE: Just a minute .
AMY: I do n't know what came over me . I suppose it was the shock of eating after so long without ; the enzymes kicking in after so long , or whatever . But then you could n't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry Speaking into his knees as he wheezes
NORVILLE: Hungry , anyway .
AMY: I do n't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life ; it 's not a happy story
NORVILLE: Oh , it 's nothing really . Just determination and hard work He unbuckles his trousers .
BUZZ: Say , buddy , here 's the whiskey you asked f
NORVILLE: Thank you , Buzz , just leave it on the desk . Leering
BUZZ: Happy days , buddy As he turns to leave
AMY: What a horrible little person .
NORVILLE: Oh , Buzz is pretty harmless , really
AMY: At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago , full of dreams and aspirations , anxious to make my way in the world
NORVILLE: I myself He crosses back to the desk .
AMY: Only to have that belief , that unsullied optimism , dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place
NORVILLE: Cigarette ?
AMY: No thank you . Seek and ye shall find , work and ye shall prosper these were the watch words of my education , the ethics of my tender years
NORVILLE: Mind if I join you ? He is pouring himself a drink .
AMY: Be my guest . A little town you 've probably
NORVILLE: He waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as he staggers to his feet .
AMY: Are you all right ?
NORVILLE: You 're from Muncie ? !
AMY: Why yes , do you know it ?
NORVILLE: 'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight on Hoist the gold and blue You 'll be tattered , torn and hurtin ' Once 'The Munce ' is done with you ! '
AMY: Oh , no , really , I
NORVILLE: Do n't bother to thank me , it 's the easiest thing in the world . Matte of fact , I know where a vacancy just came up . He hits the intercom .
AMY: Of course I went to the Muncie , uh , Secretarial Polytechnic ! Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm .
NORVILLE: A Muncie girl ! Can you beat that !
AMY: Well , I just do n't know how to thank you , Mr. Barnes
NORVILLE: Please ! Norville ! As he reaches to shake
SMITTY: Once 'The Munce ' Holy
AMY: And is this guy from chumpsville ? ! I pulled the old mother routine
SMITTY: Adenoids ?
AMY: Lumbago .
SMITTY: That gag 's got whiskers on it ! The PHONE RINGS and Smitty reaches for it .
AMY: I 'm telling you , Smitty , the board of Hudsucker is up to something
SMITTY: Yeah .
ANCIENT PUZZLER: Say , Amy , what 's a six-letter word for an affliction of the hypothalmus ? Without a break in her typing
AMY: And it 's a cinch Goiter it 's a cinch this guy is n't in on it . How much time to make the Late Final ? Smitty holds the phone away from his ear .
SMITTY: Chief .
AMY: Hiya , Chief , just the person I wanted to apologize to Smitty is looking at his watch .
SMITTY: About seven minutes .
AMY: Yeah , I was all wet about your idea man Well , thanks for being so generous It is human , and you are divine No , he 's no faker . He 's the 100 % real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article the guy is a real moron To the Ancient Puzzler
ANCIENT PUZZLER: Amy , what 's a three-letter word fo a flightless bird ?
AMY: Not now , Morris , I 'm busy That 's ight , I said hammerhead , as in a ten-letter word for a smug bullying self-important newspaperman To Morris
SMITTY: Better off falling for a rattlesnake . As she continues to type
AMY: I 'm tellin ' ya , this guy 's just the patsy and I 'm gon na find out what for . There 's a real story , Smitty , some kind of plot , a setup , a cabal , a oh , and say , did I tell ya ? !
SMITTY: He did n't offer you money .
AMY: A sawbuck !
SMITTY: Ten dollars ? Let 's grab a highball !
AMY: On Norville Barnes !
NORVILLE: Miss Smith , can you come in please to take a letter Muttering to himself
AMY: Well , I did n't bother to read the article . I did n't think the picture did you justice .
NORVILLE: The picture was fine ! It 's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath ! Of all the irresponsible Amy , take this down Dear Miss Archer . I call you 'Miss ' because you seem to have 'missed ' the boat completely on this one ! How on earth would you know whether I 'm an imbecile when you do n't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man ! No , change 'guts ' to 'courage . ' No , make it 'common decency . ' These wild speculations about my intelligence
AMY: or lack thereof ?
NORVILLE: these preposterous inventions , would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine . If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind , perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter ! But I doubt it . I most seriously doubt it . As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales , a periodical which I have enjoyed fo many years . Yours sincerely , et cetera . He drifts into thought .
AMY: Is that all , Mr. Barnes ?
NORVILLE: Well , you know me , Amy , at least etter than that that dame does . Do you think I 'm an imbecile ?
AMY: I 'm sure I
NORVILLE: Go on , tell the truth ; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in you opinion .
AMY: Well , I
NORVILLE: Oh sure , you 're biased you 're a fellow Muncian . But would an imbecile come up with this ?
AMY: Why do n't I just type this up
NORVILLE: Aww , naw , Amy , that wo n't be necessary . I should n't send it ; she 's just doing her job , I guess .
AMY: Well , I do n't know ; maybe she does deserve it . Maybe she should 've come in to face you man to man .
NORVILLE: Well , she probably had a deadline
AMY: Sure , but she could still have gotten your side for the record !
NORVILLE: Well , it 's done now what 's the use of grousing about it . Forget the letter , Amy , I just had to blow off some steam
AMY: Confused ?
NORVILLE: Yeah , you know , probably one of these fast-talking career gals , thinks she 's one of the boys . Probably is one of the boys , if you know what I mean .
AMY: I 'm quite sure I do n't know what you mean .
NORVILLE: Yeah , you know . Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays . Seems pretty obvious , does n't it ? She 's probably very unattractive and itter about it .
AMY: Oh , is that it !
NORVILLE: Yeah , you know . Probably dresses in men 's clothing , swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole , and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff o Smoocher or
AMY: Smitty .
NORVILLE: Exactly . And I bet she 's ugly . Real ugly . Otherwise , why would n't they print her picture next to he yline ?
AMY: Maybe she puts her work ahead of he personal appearance .
NORVILLE: I bet that 's exactly what she tells herself ! But you and I both know she 's just a dried-up bitter old maid . Say , how about you and I gra a little dinner and a show afte work ? I was thinking maybe The King and I Whap ! Amy slaps him . He stares .
AMY: Norville Barnes , you do n't know a thing about that woman ! You do n't know who she really is ! And only a numbskull thinks he knows things about things he knows nothing about ! He stares , rubbing his cheek .
NORVILLE: Say , what gives ?
MUSSBURGER: Memo . From the desk of Sidney J. Mussburger . Executive order numbe 530 slash A49 . To Director of the Jacksonville Facility . Copies to Legal Affairs , Business Affairs , Central Files . Re Movement of Raw Materials from the Huron Facility .

AMY: Huh ? ! She straightens and turns .
MOSES: Ah keeps the ol ' circle turning this ol ' clock needs plenty o ' care . Time is money , Miss Archuh , and money it drives that ol ' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin ' on 'roun ' . Ya see , without that capital fo'mation
AMY: Yeah , yeah . Say , you wo n't tell anyone about me , will you ?
MOSES: I do n't tell no one nothin ' lessen they ask . Thatches ai n't ole Moses ' way .
AMY: So if you know everything about Hudsucker , tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president .
MOSES: Well , that even surprised ole Moses at fust . I did n't think the Board was that smart .
AMY: That smart ? !
MOSES: But then I figured it out they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile . Like some othuh people ah know .
AMY: Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president ?
MOSES: 'Cause they 's little pigglies ! They 's tryin ' to inspire panic , make that stock git cheap so 's they can snitch it all up fo ' themselves ! But Norville , he 's got some tricks up his sleeve , he does He draws a circle with his finger in the air .
AMY: Well , maybe I
MOSES: An ' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she , uh when she do n't , uh How 'd that go ?
AMY: It 's hardly the same
MOSES: Why you do n't even know y'own self you ai n't exactly the genuine article are you , Miss Archuh ?
AMY: Well , in connection with my job , sometimes I have to go undercover as it were
MOSES: I do n't mean that ! Why you pretendin ' to be such a hard ol ' sourpuss ! Ai n't never gon na make you happy ! Neve made Warin ' happy .
AMY: I 'm happy enough .
MOSES: Okay , Miss Archuh . I got gears to see to .
AMY: I 'm plenty happy ! She is answered only by WHIRRING MACHINERY .
CHIEF: I ca n't print this !
AMY: Why not , it 's all true ! The board is using this poor guy ! They 're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap !
CHIEF: It 's pure speculation ! Why , they 'd have my butt in a satchel !
SMITTY: Ol ' satchel-butt
AMY: I know they 're gon na buy that stock
CHIEF: You do n't know anything ! Fact is they have n't bought it ! The stock is cheap , Archer ! What 're they waiting for ?
AMY: I do n't know
SMITTY: Amy 's hunches are usually pretty good , Chief .
CHIEF: You do n't accuse someone of stock manipulation on a hunch , Ignatz ! The readers of the Manhattan Argus are n't interested in sensationalism , gossip and unsupported speculation . Facts , figures those are the tools of the newspaper trade ! Why it 's almost as if you 're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull like you 've gone all soft on him !
SMITTY: Come on , Chief , that 's a low blow . Archer 's not gon na go goey for a corn-fed idiot .
CHIEF: All right , I was out of line . But you 're out of line with this stock swindle story . Gim me some more of that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff
AMY: Muncie .
CHIEF: Whatever . That 's what sells newspapers .
AMY: I 've got an even hotter story The Sap from the City Desk .
CHIEF: Watch it , Archer
AMY: It 's about a dimwitted editor who
SMITTY: Easy , Amy He gives her a companionable goose .
AMY: Back off smoocher !
SMITTY: Say , what gives ?
MRS. MUSSBURGER: So we 'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins !
NORVILLE: That must have been quite a disappointment , Mrs. Mussburger .
MRS. MUSSBURGER: Disappointment ? J'etais destroyee ! I was in bed for a week ! Positively sick with fury ! I called in the gardener and said , 'Monsieur Gonzalez , either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee !

MUSSBURGER: So they tell me . Norville , let me shepherd you through some of the introductions here . Try not to talk too much ; some of our biggest stockholders are , uh scratch that Say whatever you want .
MUSSBURGER: Norville Barnes , allow me to introduce Mr. Zebulon Cardozo , one of Hudsucke Industries largest and most loyal stockholders . Ignoring Norville 's proffered hand
NORVILLE: No need for concern , sir ; it 's only natural in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover
CARDOZO: So I 'm yella , am I ? ! ! He starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket
MRS. CARDOZO: Zebulon , you mind now and quit bein ' sech an ole grizzly .
CARDOZO: Aww , I was n't gon na hurt the boy , Lorelei
NORVILLE: I 'm sorry , Sid , I thought maybe if I showed him the long view we might
MUSSBURGER: Norville , this is Thorstensen Finlandsen , who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled investors . Norville nervously pumps Findlandsen 's hand .
NORVILLE: Hello , Mr. Finlandsen , so sorry to meet you uh , happy to walk into y uh , pleased to make your
MRS. FINDLANDSEN: Ahhh ! There is a drum roll and , as the lights dim
EXECUTIVE #1: How 's it going , Mr. Mussburger ?
MUSSBURGER: Bad .
EXECUTIVE #2: Good .
MUSSBURGER: But not bad enough .
EXECUTIVE #3: Too bad .
MUSSBURGER: It could be better , it could be worse .
EXECUTIVE #1: Then it ca n't be bad !
EXECUTIVE #2: Could n't be better if it could n't be worse .
ALL: Hmmmmmm .
AMY: Norville ?
NORVILLE: Oh . Nothing , really , just the more timid investors are no longe unning for cover .
AMY: Let me look . He does .
NORVILLE: Sid found me the icepack .
AMY: Let me hold it , or you 'll have a eal shiner .
NORVILLE: Thanks . People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story .
AMY: I 'm sorry .
NORVILLE: Oh , it is n't your fault , Amy . You 're the one person who 's been standing by me through all this . As she rolls the pack gently across his eye
AMY: Norville there 's something I have to tell you . You see , I 'm not really a secretary .
NORVILLE: I know that , Amy .
AMY: You do ?
NORVILLE: I understand that you 're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts . I 'm not that skilled as president . Oh sure , I put up a big front not that everyone 's buying it .
AMY: I believe in you , Norville At least I believe in your intentions
NORVILLE: Oh , I do n't blame them , really . I guess I have sort of made a mess of things . These folks have to protect their investment . Most of them are very nice people
AMY: Norville , you ca n't trust people here like you did in Muncie They gaze out at the city .
NORVILLE: Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson 's feed tower and look out over the town ?
AMY: Huh ?
NORVILLE: You know , on farm route 17 .
AMY: Oh yes ! In Muncie !
NORVILLE: No ! In Vidalia ! Farm Route 17 !
AMY: Uh Yes . Seventeen . Yes , I well no , I I never really There 's a place I go now , the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village . It 's called Ann 's 440 . It 's a beatnik bar .
NORVILLE: You do n't say .
AMY: Yes , you can get carrot juice o Italian coffee , and the people there well , none of them quite fit in . You 'd love it why do n't you come there with me they 're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year 's Eve . I go every year .
NORVILLE: Every year ?
AMY: Well this year if it 's good I plan to make it a tradition . Uh , my it certainly is beautiful
NORVILLE: Well , the Hindus say and the eatniks also that in the next life some of us will come back as ants . Some will be butterflies . Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea .
AMY: What a beautiful thought .
NORVILLE: What do you think you were in you previous life , Amy ?
AMY: Oh , I do n't know . Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys
NORVILLE: Oh no , Amy , pardon me for saying so ut I find that very farfetched .
AMY: Norville , there really is something I have to tell you
NORVILLE: That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest , or a warthog . No , I think it more likely that you were a gazelle , with long , graceful legs , gamboling through the underbrush . Perhaps we met once , a chance encounter in a forest glade . I must have been an antelope or an ibex . What times we must have had foraging together for sustenance , picking the grubs and burrs from one another 's coats . Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways
AMY: I wish it were that simple , Norville . I wish I was still a gazelle , and you were an antelope or an ibex .
NORVILLE: Well , can I at least call you deer ? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ! Seriously , Amy , the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma ' the great circle of life , death and rebirth . Morosely
AMY: Yeah , I think I 've heard of that . What goes around comes around .
NORVILLE: That 's it . A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve He slaps his fist into his palm .
AMY: Oh , Norville
NORVILLE: Kiss me once , Amy ! Kiss me once fo luck !
AMY: Sure , Norville , sure
NORVILLE: So we have economy , simplicity , low production cost and the potential for mass appeal , and all that spells out great profitability
NORVILLE: It 's fun , it 's healthy , it 's good exercise ; kids 'll just love it , and we put a little sand inside to make the whole experience more pleasant . And the great part is we wo n't have to charge an arm and a leg !
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: Yeah but What is it ?
EXECUTIVE #2: Does it have rules ?
EXECUTIVE #3: Can more than one play ?
EXECUTIVE #4: What makes you think it 's a game ?
EXECUTIVE #3: Is it a game ?
EXECUTIVE #5: Will it break ?
EXECUTIVE #6: It better break eventually !
EXECUTIVE #2: Is there an object ?
EXECUTIVE #3: Are you supposed to make it fly off ?
EXECUTIVE #5: Does it come with batteries ?
EXECUTIVE #4: Could we charge extra for them ?
EXECUTIVE #7: Is it safe for toddlers ?
EXECUTIVE #3: How can you tell when you 're done ?
EXECUTIVE #2: How do you make it stop ?
EXECUTIVE #1: Is that a girl 's model or a boy 's ?
EXECUTIVE #3: Can a parent assemble it ? ?
EXECUTIVE #7: What if you get tired before it 's done ?
EXECUTIVE #6: Is there a larger model for the obese ?
EXECUTIVE #4: Can you do it around your neck ?
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE: And finally what is it ?
NORVILLE: You know , for kids ! It 's it 's well , it 's
MUSSBURGER: It 's brilliant . The Board looks at Mussburger .
NORVILLE: Well I 'm for it As furiously BUSY MUSIC STARTS
AMY: Norville !
REPORTER #1: Mr. Barnes , how 'd ya come up with the idea for the hula hoop ?
NORVILLE: Well , it was no great idea , really . A thing like this , it takes a whole company to put it together , and I 'm just grateful for the opportunity
REPORTER #2: Mr. Barnes , did you have any idea there 'd be such a huge response ?
NORVILLE: Well , frankly , I do n't think anybody expected this much hoopla He is surprised by a burst of laughter .
REPORTER #3: 'Hoopla on the hula hoop ' can we quote you on that , Mr. Barnes ?
NORVILLE: Well sure , I guess
REPORTER #4: Mr. Barnes , are you thinking of giving yourself a nice fat raise ?
NORVILLE: Ha-ha-ha-ha . Come on , guys Flash bulb explosion effects a
REPORTER #1: Mr. Barnes , did the board conside you an 'idea man ' when they promoted you from the mail room ?
NORVILLE: Well , I guess so I do n't think they promoted me because they thought I was a jerk .
REPORTER #2: Mr. Barnes , what 's the next big idea for you and Hudsucker Industries ?
NORVILLE: Jeez , I do n't know . An idea like this sweet baby does n't just come overnight
REPORTER: Mr. Barnes , are you
NORVILLE: Although I 'll tell you one thing I certainly did n't expect all this 'hoopla ' !
REPORTER #1: Mr. Barnes , Mr. Barnes , Rumpus magazine has called you the most eligible bachelor of the year , and the society pages have been linking you with high-fashion model Za-Za . Would you care to comment ?
NORVILLE: There 's no truth to the rumors ; we 're just dear friends He looks to one side .
REPORTER #2: Ho-leeee !
REPORTER #3: Mr. Barnes , whither Hudsucker ? Whither Norville Barnes ?
REPORTER #4: How do you respond to the charges that you 're out of ideas ? Has Norville Barnes run dry ?
NORVILLE: Not at all . Why , just this week I came up with several new sweet ideas . A larger model hula hoop for the portly . A battery option for the lazy and handicapped . A model with more sand for hard-of-hearing . I 'm earning my keep .
REPORTER #5: Speaking of that , Mr. Barnes , do you expect to get a raise ?
NORVILLE: Well , by anyone 's account I 've saved Hudsucker Industries ; our stock is worth more than it 's ever been . So , yes , I expect to be compensated fo that .
NORVILLE: ha-ha-ha-ha-ha !
MUSSBURGER: Pull yourself together , Addison . Addison snuffles .
ADDISON: Nobody told me ! Nobody told me ! You sold all of our stock ?
MUSSBURGER: We dumped the whole load . Now quit showboating , Addison
ADDISON: I had twenty thousand shares ! I 'd be a millionaire now !
MUSSBURGER: Sure , sure , we 'd all be millionaires . There 's no point in looking back . At the time , Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market , further depress the stock then we 'd buy it all back , and more of course , once it got cheap
ADDISON: Cheap ! Cheap ! It 's never been more valuable ! And I 'm ruined ! Ruined ! He climbs up onto the board table .
EXECUTIVE: Addison !
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE: Myron !
ADDISON: Aaaaahhh !
MUSSBURGER: Plexiglas . Had it installed last week .
EXECUTIVE: Myron ?
MUSSBURGER: All right , so the kid caught a wave . So right now he and his dingus are on top . Well , this too shall pass . Myrtle J. Mussburger did n't raise her boy to go knockkneed at the first sign of adversity . I say , we made this kid and we can break him . I say , the higher he climbs , the harde he drops . I say , yes , the kid has a future , and in it I see shame , dishonor , ignominy and disgrace .
NORVILLE: Hold it !
AMY: For Pete 's sake , Norville !
NORVILLE: Oh ! Hello , Amy was it I thought she said , Mamie
AMY: Never mind about that She shakes a piece of paper at Norville .
NORVILLE: Well , I would n't call them nincom
AMY: They 're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker . Why , in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work , people with wives and children and families
NORVILLE: Well yes , we 're pruning away some of the dead wood , but if
AMY: You mean you know about this ?
NORVILLE: Know about it ? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization ? No , this was my idea from the start .
AMY: Your i
NORVILLE: We have to be realistic , Amy . You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker
AMY: You 're awful kind to yourself , Norville Barnes the fact is you 've slowed down , sitting up here like a sultan , not doing a lick of work ! Why you know it 's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you have n't come up with one since the hoop and the reason 's plain to see ! You 've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place it was n't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out of here ? !
NORVILLE: Now , Aim
AMY: Shutup ! and do n't think I have n't noticed how you 've changed . I used to think you were a swell guy well , to be honest I thought you were an imbecile
NORVILLE: Now , Aim
AMY: Shutup ! but then I figured out you were a swell guy , a little slow maybe , but a swell guy ! Well , maybe you 're not so slow , but you 're not so swell either and it looks like you 're an imbecile after
NORVILLE: Now , Aim
AMY: Shutup ! after all ! You have n't talked to me for a week and now I 'm going to say my piece . I 've got a prediction for you , Norville Barnes I predict that since you 've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad , you 're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you . You 're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the espect of a Board that would n't give you the time of day if you if you
NORVILLE: Worked in a watch factory ? The Goon looks up from his funnies .
GOON: Huh-huh-huh !
AMY: Shutup ! Exactly ! Do n't you remember how you used to feel about the hoop ? You told me you were gon na bring a smile to the hips of everyone in America , egardless of race , creed or color . Finally there 'd be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together even if it kept 'em apart , spacially you know , for kids ? Your words , Norville , not mine . I used to love Norville Barnes yes , love him ! when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head , ut now your head is too big to be in over !
NORVILLE: Now , Amy

MUSSBURGER: Sure , sure , it 's a tough course . Well thanks for coming , kid . I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed it seems we 're having some security problems here at the Hud .
NORVILLE: Ya do n't say .
MUSSBURGER: Mm . Ordinarily I would n't bother you with it , but this is embarrassing , kid it seems to concern you directly .
NORVILLE: How 's that , Sid ?
MUSSBURGER: It 's not important in itself some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you 'd stolen the idea for the , uh , the hoop dingus from him
NORVILLE: Huh ? ! He no , I he 's just maybe I was a little rough on the oy , ya see I
MUSSBURGER: Ah forget it , kid , ya do n't have to explain to me . He 's a little person . He 's nothing . Like I say , ordinarily it would just be a nuisance . But it seems well , there was a spy in the company
CHIEF: He grins wolfishly .
SMITTY: and she 's dynamite !
AMY: But , Al , it 's the bunk ! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him ! Why Buzz could n't have invented it look at the man he 's an imbecile !

SMITTY: You 're not the only one with sources , Amy
CHIEF: Smith has a source on the Hud board very senior , very hushhush
AMY: Yeah , and I 'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger !

NORVILLE: Yes sir
HUDSUCKER: Anyway . Any particular reason you did n't give him my Blue Letter ? I mean , Jesus , Norman , just a dying man 's last words and wishes , no big deal .
NORVILLE: Huh ? Oh , geez , Mr. Hudsucker , I apologize , there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must 've mislaid
HUDSUCKER: It 's sittin ' in your apron pocket , ight where you left it . Imbecile .

HUDSUCKER: Yeah , yeah , it 's the standard esignation boilerplate go down to the second paragraph .
NORVILLE: 'Many years , uh I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on , ending my tenure at Hudsucker , and here on Earth . You will be thinking , Why now , when things are going so well ? Granted , from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials , sure , sure , we 're doing fine . However , Sid . These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure . I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company . Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success . ' How has this come to pass ? When and why did I trade all of my hopes , dreams and aspirations , for the emptiness of power and wealth ? What the heck have I done ?
HUDSUCKER: Skip this part
NORVILLE: 'And so , Sid , the future does not elong to such as I nor even you . We have made our compromises with time . The future belongs to the young , who may more energetically wage the attle against corruption . Accordingly , in the spirit of hope , and the ringing in of the new , I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company , and my seat on the oard , to whomever is Hudsucker 's most recent employee at the time of my demise . I know this will disappoint you you , Sid , who have served so diligently and for so long . But '
HUDSUCKER: tough titty toenails ! He roars with laughter .
NORVILLE: 'But Sid , let me urge you to work closely with the new president , and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies but not you soul . For while we must strive fo success , we must not worship it . Long live the Hud . Waring Hudsucker ' Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod .
HUDSUCKER: Geez . Pleased with himself

LILA: I 'm not sorry . So I spend the rest of my life in jail . So what ? I 've een in jail my whole life anyway . A jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones
PUFF: I am sorry , gentlemen , sorry for all of us . Your 's is a complicated , sad world .
NATHAN: I do n't even know what sorry means anymore . It 's odd . When I was alive I knew maybe it was all I knew ut here sorry is meaningless . Love is meaningless . Jealousy is meaningless . Ambition is meaningless . Everything that motivated my every eath while I was alive is meaningless now . I guess that 's how I can be sure I 'm eally dead .

NATHAN: I have to say I always hated apes . Of course I do n't any longer . I do n't even know what hate means now . But while alive , I hated apes . I blame my parents . I mean , I do n't blame them . I do n't know what blame is , eally , anymore , but I think they influenced me in my ape-hating tendencies .
MOTHER: Nathan , those are not monkeys . Those are apes . Mountain Gorillas to be precise .
PUFF'S FATHER: I am not a human being ! I am an animal !
MOTHER: And furthermore Tell him , Harold .
FATHER: Uh We must never act like apes , son . For you see , The ape is our closest iological relative specifically the pygmy chimp . A single chromosome separates us . But you know what truly separates us from the apes , what makes us bette than apes ?
MOTHER: Enough , Harold .
LILA: Oh , I had sexual urges . I had the urge to merge , officers . Inside I was 100 % Grade A female . But what self-loathing I felt ! Who would have someone as repulsive , as unladylike as me ? I did everything I could to shield the world from this epulsiveness .

LILA: Yeah , Natalie . It 's hair . It grows .
FEMALE ROOMMATE: Well , do n't jump down my throat . I 'm just trying to help .
LILA: How is that helping , Natalie ? How exactly ?
FEMALE ROOMMATE: Look , if you 're going to be like that You should be appreciative that I 'm interested .
LILA: Why , because I 'm a freak and you are eautiful , and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak , nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles ?
FEMALE ROOMMATE: You 're fucked up , Lila . Why do n't you fucking try electrolysis or something ? Figure it out fo chrissake .

ROSE: You still in the market for a real oy ?
LILA: Always . Ow .
ROSE: Cause there 's this guy . My brothe knows him . Might be right up you alley .
LILA: Tell me . I could use someone up my alley .
ROSE: I do n't get that . Is that sexual ?
LILA: Shut up and tell me .
ROSE: Handsome , thirties , psychologist
LILA: Loves animals ? Ouch . Must love animals , Rose .
ROSE: Loves animals . Loves you .
LILA: What do you mean ?
ROSE: Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine . Mr. handsome , animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you .
LILA: Holy shit . Your brother did n't tell him about the nature of ou elationship , did he ?
ROSE: My brother is discreet .
LILA: Wo n't he be able to tell ?
ROSE: My brother says the guy 's a thirty- five year old virgin , so maybe he wo n't know how women usually feel . Plus he 's got bad eyesight , almost legally blind , which is helpful in this situation . Plus he 's got an extremely small penis , of which he is `` mortifyingly ashamed '' , so chances are he 'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention , that he 'll be yours forever .
LILA: God , he must be really close to you other to tell him such personal stuff .
ROSE: Yeah , well my brother is his shrink .
NATHAN: Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read .
LILA: Thank you so much . I love slugs . All slugs , not just banana slugs .
NATHAN: As do I .
LILA: They 're so even keel . They forge ahead with slow determination . They do n't get distracted or side-tracked . They do n't care what they look like . They do n't care that people look at them and go , `` Ewww . A slug . ''
NATHAN: They do n't seem to be especially ego driven , this is true .
LILA: You 've got to respect that .
NATHAN: I have to say that I 'm not there yet .
LILA: Where ?
NATHAN: Slugdom . Sluggishness . Whatever you 'd call it . I 'm not there yet . I still have many human characteristics .
LILA: That 's not necessarily a bad thing .
NATHAN: Yes . I suppose not . But still . One would like to move along . To move eyond .
LILA: I 'm not sure we can escape ou natures . Believe me I 've tried . I 'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to .
NATHAN: I love that you said that . It makes me feel a bit lighter . I 've been ather heavy lately . Thinking about my childhood . Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing . I 've been seeing someone . A therapist .
LILA: You are a therapist , right ?
NATHAN: No no . I 'm a psychologist , but I do esearch . I 'm a behaviorist . I work with animals . Mice at the moment .
LILA: I hope you do n't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments , Nathan .
NATHAN: Heavens no . My work now is Right now I 'm teaching mice well , table manners , to be candid .
LILA: How 's it going ?
NATHAN: Quite well , really . It 's a lot of work . A lot of reinforcement , mostly positive . Right now I 've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins . Tiny napkins of course .
LILA: Paper or cloth ?
NATHAN: I hope you do n't think me daft . It 's important work . It 's part of a large sociological experiment . I 'm federally funded .
LILA: What 's the larger experiment ?
NATHAN: It 's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice , they can be taught to humans .
LILA: Going out on a limb , are n't you , Nathan ?
NATHAN: The truth is most people do n't have table manners today . And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear , civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels .
LILA: I 'm not sure .
NATHAN: Courtesy , decorum , manners , are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse . Rudeness , vulgarity , meanness are the norm .
LILA: We are animals after all .
NATHAN: Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice , I can teach them to humans . If I can teach table manners to humans , I can save the world .
ROSE: So ?
LILA: I really like him , Rose . He 's so passionate about his work .
ROSE: My brother says he likes you , too .
LILA: Really ?
ROSE: Yeah . Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother . And according to my brother Nathan 's abormally close with his mother .
NATHAN: I began going to a therapist when I was in my thirties , because I felt that I was n't enjoying life the way my friends were . After a time my childhood came up .
FATHER: Lord , we thank you for this bountiful gift we are about to receive .
ALL: Amen .
MOTHER: My God , no ! My God ! Oh , Nathan . Nathan looks up .
FATHER: That is the wrong fork , young man .
MOTHER: Harold , tell the boy more .
FATHER: Too late . Go to your room .
MOTHER: Harold ! Tell the boy again .
FATHER: No `` buts . '' Go to your room now .
MOTHER: And ?
FATHER: And think about what you 've done .
WENDALL: And do you think maybe this early childhood indoctrination has something to do with your interest in table manners in the present .
NATHAN: I do n't think so . No .
LILA: It looks wonderful .
NATHAN: You look wonderful . I 'm on top of the world tonight , Lila . Work is going splendidly and my personal life is
LILA: Um-mmm . Oh Nathan , this salad is delish
NATHAN: My God ! The fork ! The fork !
LILA: I 'm sorry ?
NATHAN: Tell her , Harold It 's just that It 's nothing . It 's just that the outside fork is the salad fork . One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses .
LILA: Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Nathan . I never really learned those things .
NATHAN: No biggie .
LILA: Boy , this is good !
NATHAN: I 'm sorry that I became so upset .
LILA: No , I 'm sorry . I 'm really backward in certain areas .
NATHAN: It 's only that I really enjoy you company and
LILA: You do ?
NATHAN: Yes , and
LILA: You really enjoy my company ?
NATHAN: Yes . Please do n't talk with food in you mouth , Lila . Please . You 're so pretty and it only mars your I 'm sorry . I 'm being critical .
LILA: I like you , too , Nathan .
NATHAN: You do ?
LILA: Yeah But I have some peculiarities also .
NATHAN: I do n't care . I do n't care ! Like what , for example ?
LILA: Like nothing .
ROSE: My brother says things are going eally well between you and Nathan .
LILA: I can not believe how in love I am with this man .
ROSE: Yeah ?
LILA: He 's so cute . I even like his cute little penis . It 's like a little pig 's penis or something . Rose , we connect on every level . I 've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with .
ROSE: Do n't throw that away . I had that once with a guy . But I threw it away for a cheap thrill .
LILA: One night stand ?
ROSE: No . I married a midget .
LILA: Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill ?
ROSE: Well he was n't really a midget . He was on the cusp of midgethood . That 's what made it cheap . Had he been an actual midget , there would 've been nothing cheap about it , my dear .
LILA: I did n't know you were into that sort of thing .
ROSE: Let me tell you , honey , midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship . They 're portable . They 're controllable . They 're eager . And they 're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor .
LILA: I have a friend you might like to meet .
ROSE: Oh ?
LILA: Three foot one .
ROSE: Be still my crotch .
LILA: Rose , Nathan 's no midget , but he 's asked me to move in with him .
ROSE: Yeah . My brother told me .
LILA: And I think I 'm going to .
ROSE: Stand on a stepladder sometimes .
NATHAN: Lila moved in with me . Did I love her ? I thought so . But from my new vantage point I realize that love is nothing more than a messy conglomeration of need , desperation , fear of death , insecurity about penis size , and the self-involved , ego driven need to collect other people 's hearts . Not that I judge it . Listen , I do n't want to be dead yet . Is there any way to
LILA: It 's lovely to finally meet you , Mr. and Mrs. Bronfman . I 've heard so much about you and I 've seen you in photographs from Nathan 's childhood , ut it 's nice to meet you in the flesh . I must say , you look exactly the same as in the photographs .
MOTHER: Thank you , dear .
NATHAN: Actually , Mother and Father , you look very , very old . You look terrible .
LILA: Nathan !
MOTHER: Tell him , Harold .
FATHER: Son , your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater . We forgot to take off our make-up .
LILA: Goodness , you two look exactly as you did in those old photos .
MOTHER: Yes , so you mentioned earlier , dear .
NATHAN: Lila 's a nature writer , mother .
MOTHER: I love nature . As long as it stays in the zoo where it belongs .
NATHAN: Of course she does , mother .
LILA: Do you ? Oh do you , darling ?
NATHAN: Why certainly !
LILA: Oh , darling . I 'm so relieved . Let 's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow !
NATHAN: That 's a great idea . Nathan kisses her .
LILA: It 'll be wonderful ! I 'll show you my old stomping grounds !
NATHAN: Terrific . Ca n't wait !
LILA: I do n't think so . Why ?
NATHAN: Darling , did you bring the insect epellent lotion ?
LILA: Yes , darling .
NATHAN: Oh , and the sun block ?
LILA: Of course .
NATHAN: What SPF , sweetie ?
LILA: Fifteen .
NATHAN: Perfectomundo ! We are ready ! Say , would n't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block ? Think of all the time one would save .
LILA: Yes , darling .
NATHAN: I think I 'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that . Oh ! Did you bring the first aid kit ?
LILA: Yes .
NATHAN: Flares ?
LILA: Absolutely .
NATHAN: We could call it `` Quit Bugging Me , Sunny . '' Get it ? Sunny . S-u-n-n-y .
LILA: That 's very funny .
NATHAN: I love you so much .
PUFF: Then , gentlemen , one day I saw something I had n't seen since my father died in a freak accident involving a rotted log and fou thousand bees stinging his head I saw other human beings . They chattered away at each other in what appeared to be gibberish . Later I learned it was English . Now I wonder if perhaps my initial assessment had n't been correct .
LILA: It was a flash of white . I ruled out deer immediately . Too upright .
NATHAN: What ?
LILA: I do n't know . Something .
NATHAN: A deer ?
LILA: No . Too upright . Might 've been a person .
NATHAN: It might behoove us to turn back at this point . Lila walks in the direction of the sighting .
LILA: Come on .
NATHAN: If it 's a person , why should we go see it ? It 's not like it 's nature o anything . It 's just a person . Sometimes people who live in the woods do n't want to be seen . They live in the woods because they 're anti-social , Lila . We have to respect that .
PUFF: I had never seen anything like it .
LILA: He bolted .
NATHAN: Oh my God ! Is he dead ? Please put something on . Lila looks up at icily at Nathan .
LILA: I think he 's feral .
NATHAN: Feral ? Do n't touch him ! He might be diseased ! He might My God , rabies !
LILA: He looks perfectly fine .
NATHAN: I think we should go . Please . Before he wakes up and , I do n't know , eats us , or whatever feral things do .
LILA: I do n't understand you . This is fascinating and you just want to run away . I mean , here we have a human eing totally uncontaminated by civilization , totally free , and all you want to do is run back to your
NATHAN: Actually , I just had an amusing thought .
LILA: What ?
NATHAN: Feral , huh ? Totally uncontaminated ?
LILA: Look at him . He does n't understand English . He moves like an animal .
NATHAN: It 's perfect !
LILA: Nathan , what the hell are you talking about ?
NATHAN: Forget mice ! Actually forget guinea pigs , cats , monkeys , and chimps also . I 'm on to stage five The human subject .
LILA: Oh no . You ca n't take him from his home , Nathan .
NATHAN: Do n't you see ? He 's my Tabula Rasa , my Eliza Dolittle . He 's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain . He 's going to make me famous .
LILA: I wo n't allow you . It 's wrong . He 's happy here .
NATHAN: Is he , Lila ? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness ? Never to know the love of a good woman , never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet , never to read Moby Dick , or marvel at a Monet , or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work , smoke a pipe , and wonder about the nature of reality .
LILA: You 'd be taking away his freedom , Nathan .
NATHAN: Freedom 's just another word fo nothing left to lose , Lila , to quote Janet Jackson .
LILA: Oh God , I have no one . Nothing . You give me this beautiful gift , this glorious sunset . But with no one to say `` is n't that a beautiful sunset '' to , it becomes meaningless , just another stupid sunset . They happen everyday . So what ?
NATHAN: what is it that makes us human , if not the knowledge that we are indeed human ? Think of this poo soul 's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon
LILA: All right .
NATHAN: Great . Grab his feet . We 'll throw him in the trunk .
GABRIELLE: Doctor
NATHAN: Good morning .
GABRIELLE: Oui , doctor , oui .
NATHAN: Good morning We need a name for him , do n't we ?
GABRIELLE: Oui .
NATHAN: You decide . Today is your day .
GABRIELLE: Really ? My day ? Well , I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl . This one reminds me of my dog , all shaggy ! So cute ! I loved my doggie very much , monsieur .
NATHAN: Puff it is then . Puff Bronfman . Is that okay ?
GABRIELLE: Oui . Perfect !
NATHAN: Good morning , Puff Bronfman . I 'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle . We 're your mommy and daddy while you are here .
GABRIELLE: Dr. Bronfman ! Dr. Bronfman ! Nathan turns .
NATHAN: Oh , Hi , Gabrielle .
GABRIELLE: Hi . I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you . Now I 'm embarrassed that I say this . They walk along .
NATHAN: No . Do n't be . I really enjoy hearing that . You 're a terrific assistant .
GABRIELLE: Merci . I Do you would you like to go get a cup of coffee , perhaps ?
NATHAN: Well , I do n't know . I 'm actually on my way to
GABRIELLE: Now I am truly embarrassed . Forgive me . I should not have asked such a stupid question . I know you are a very important man and
NATHAN: No . Do n't be silly . It 's just
GABRIELLE: I am a foolish little thing . I am pink in my face , no ? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and I am ashamed . I 'll see you tomorrow , okay ? Unless Am I fired now ? Gabrielle pouts . Nathan is charmed .
NATHAN: Not at all .
GABRIELLE: I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man but I 'm talking too much again , no ?
NATHAN: Of course not .
GABRIELLE: You 're so sweet . Oh , why are there not more men out there like you ?
NATHAN: There there .
GABRIELLE: You know just the right thing to say .
NATHAN: Listen , you 're the best assistant I 've ever had Gabrielle .
GABRIELLE: I like it when you say my name . Is that stupid ?
NATHAN: What are you doing in there ?
LILA: Nathan , I
NATHAN: I do n't get it . I do n't get it . I do n't get it . How could I find myself in this mess ? This is a mess . This is not a situation I understand . This is a mess . How do I extricate myself from this mess ? Is my girlfriend a man ? I do n't understand . This is not part of any plan . She deceived me . She has hair . But am I being fair ? So what if she has hair ? Who am I to judge ? I have hair . But I 'm supposed to have hair . I am a man . Men are supposed to have hair . But poor Lila . Think of what she 's had to go through . The courage she 's had to have in the face of this abomination of nature . I should love her all the more . I should love every hair on her body . I mean , she does n't mind that I have a mortifyingly small
GABRIELLE: Oh , Doctor . I did not know . I 'm sorry to disturb you . I just came for some papers I left .
NATHAN: Gabrielle . No , I 'm sorry if I startled you . I came to think . God , Did I hang up on you ?
GABRIELLE: Oui . Perhaps I called at a bad time . I am sorry .
NATHAN: No . I just got distracted . I 'm so sorry .
GABRIELLE: Is everything fine ?
NATHAN: Oui . Now you 've got me talking French .
GABRIELLE: I was in my p.j . 's when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over . See ? I rushed right out of the house . I must look a mess . I 'm so embarrassed .
NATHAN: I 'm in my p.j . 's , too . Funny , huh ? Puff is taken also . His eyes are wide .
GABRIELLE: Coincidence , yes ? And how is our son ?
NATHAN: Our ? Oh ! He seems fine . I guess we woke him . The lights and all .
GABRIELLE: I should turn them off . Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl .
NATHAN: When you were a little French girl ?
GABRIELLE: Oui .
NATHAN: That would be good .
GABRIELLE: There .
NATHAN: Maybe we should just sit for a while . It 's very peaceful .
GABRIELLE: It 's nice , yes . I 'm glad I ran into you , both in our silly pajamas . It is two happy coincidences , no ?
NATHAN: Yes . Happy happy .
GABRIELLE: Yet you look so sad . A great man like you should not be sad .
NATHAN: I 'm fine . Life is funny , that 's all .
GABRIELLE: I am sleepy .
NATHAN: I should n't say this , but you 're pretty , Gabrielle . It 's unprofessional , I know .
GABRIELLE: Really ? I always think myself so ugly . No , not ugly , but plain . A wallflower .
NATHAN: Really ? No . Not at all . You 're a very pretty girl . You should know that . You should be confident .
GABRIELLE: Thank you so much . Merci . It 's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment .
NATHAN: It 's true . I would n't lie .
GABRIELLE: You are sweet .
NATHAN: So soft . So smooth . I 'm sorry . It 's just
GABRIELLE: Shh .
NATHAN: Was that okay ? I mean , was I able to satisfy you ?
LILA: You are an animal .
NATHAN: Really ? Wow ! That 's that 's terrific to hear from someone so feminine , so female .
LILA: I love being female because it , how do you say , allows me to be close to men .
NATHAN: I 'm glad you 're female . Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene ?
GABRIELLE: Anyway it 's time he grew up . N'est- ce pa ? I love chest hair on a man . I know it is n't fashionable now , hairy men . But to me it is the very sign of masculinity .
NATHAN: Nothing , my darling . All is right with the world .
PUFF: I saw it , gentlemen . I saw the whole sweaty , passionate , ugly , beautiful act , and to use the vernacular , I wanted me some of that .
NATHAN: Excellent , Puff . Now , the lady you 're with excuses herself to go powde her nose .
GABRIELLE: Dr. Bronfman 's line . Yes . One moment please . Lila .
NATHAN: Shit . Hi , honey .
LILA: So , how 's it going today ?
NATHAN: Everything 's fine , honey . We do n't need to talk . Besides I have to work late .
GABRIELLE: I do n't know , Nathan . What are you supposed to do ?
NATHAN: You do n't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem .
GABRIELLE: Funny . I thought that 's exactly what you did . You just do n't have the courage to admit it to yourself .
NATHAN: Funny . I still feel guilt . Even dead . One would 've hoped But alas . You know , I really did love Lila . But with her problem and then when Gabrielle revealed her feelings . And Gabrielle was so conventionally female . And she had an accent . I was lost from that moment on . But Gabrielle was right . I could n't admit it to myself , this shallowness of character , let alone to Lila .
LILA: Are you seeing somebody else , Nathan ? I just have to know .
NATHAN: Of course not .
LILA: It would just be helpful to know .
NATHAN: No .
LILA: Because , you know , you seem so distant . And you work late every night . And we hardly ever have sex , and when we do , it 's I do n't know . It feels different .
NATHAN: I 'm just preoccupied .
LILA: Do you like my new look ?
NATHAN: Yeah . It 's nice . It 's really good .
LILA: I 'm trying , you know . I 'm trying to be what you want . I want to be what you want , Nathan . All I want is to be what you want .
NATHAN: Shh . It 's okay . It 's okay , Lila . You 're what I want . You know that . You 're exactly what I want .
LILA: Really ?
NATHAN: Sure . Of course .
LILA: Because I 'm really trying , you know . Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis .
NATHAN: That 's great .
LILA: I 've signed up for a ballet class . And look at my nails ! A real girl !
NATHAN: That 's great . It 's a great color fo you .
LILA: Oh , Nathan , let 's have a baby !
NATHAN: So anyway , that 's the nightmare I 've een having lately .
WENDALL: Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila 's unusually hairy body ?
NATHAN: No , why ?
WENDALL: Well , it seems that since Lila oached the subject of children , you 've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the , uh , body hair .
NATHAN: Oh , I see . Yes , that 's something to think about . That 's very good . That 's what you get the big bucks , right ? Ha ha .
WENDALL: I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila .
NATHAN: I love Lila . I mean , she 's a wonderful person . And she loves me ! That 's no small potatoes . I mean she really loves me . She 's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me . And she 's a good person . A truly good person . How rare is that in this world , eh ? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection , if it can even be called that . I mean , God knows I 'm not perfect ! What about my eyesight ? It 's lousy , that 's what ! Lila 's not going to leave me because of my eyesight . What about my penis ?
WENDALL: And how do you feel about Gabrielle ? Nathan puts his head in his hands and sighs .
PUFF: Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen .
NATHAN: Bravo , Puff ! Bravo !
GABRIELLE: Hmmmph .
NATHAN: Gabby , what is it ?
GABRIELLE: Hmmph . Hmmph . Nathan , we have to talk , you and I .
NATHAN: Fine .
GABRIELLE: Not in front of the boy .
NATHAN: Very well .
GABRIELLE: Stop . Get away .
NATHAN: What is it ?
GABRIELLE: You have to choose Nathan . It 's like Sophie 's choice . Only it is Nathan 's choice . Did you ever see that movie , Sophie 's Choice ? It is like that . Only it is this .
NATHAN: Gabby , you know I 'm trying to sort things out .
GABRIELLE: No ! It is now that you must decide . I love you , Doctor Nathan but I will not wait . I will not e your chippy . I will not be you little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish . My love . I want to have a sweet tiny aby inside my belly from you . Nathan gets a faraway look in his eyes .
NATHAN: I love you so much , Gabrielle .
GABRIELLE: But ? But ? There is a `` but , '' Nathan .
NATHAN: But I do n't know how to leave Lila .
LILA: Oh ! I did n't see you there , sneaky boy ! You 're like a boy sneaking in
NATHAN: the back door of a movie theater . Yes , indeed .
LILA: You remember that from my book ? I 'm touched ! What 's wrong ?
NATHAN: Nothing . Hard day . Gon na have a drink .
LILA: I 'll make it . I 'm so happy , Nathan ! Everything 's going to be so great ! Scotch on the ocks , right ? Just kidding . I know what you drink , mister . I know what you drink . Voila !
NATHAN: Thanks .
LILA: How 's work ?
NATHAN: Cruddy , okay ? Are you satisfied ?
LILA: No . I do n't want your work to be cruddy .
NATHAN: My assistant quit today . Okay ? He was highly valuable to the project .
LILA: Oh , baby . I 'm sorry . Ca n't you hire somebody else ?
NATHAN: I guess .
LILA: Hey ! I could come work for you ! I know I have n't been all that supportive of this project , but I 've come around .
NATHAN: Have you ?
LILA: Oh yes , baby ! I think that this is a wonderful project you 're doing , taking this poor unfortunate , uncivilized creature and turning him into a human eing ! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are !
NATHAN: Really ?
LILA: Yes ! And I want to help . You wo n't have to pay me , and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway .
NATHAN: How come ?
LILA: Who needs it ? I have you and I have eing a woman and I have thinking about womanly things ! I love being a woman because
NATHAN: Such as what womanly things ?
LILA: Such as my man and how to please him ! Such as making wonderful dinners fo my man ! Such as looking pretty for my man ! And I 'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal !
NATHAN: I let her sell her soul . I stood by as she did it . It 's inexcusable . At the time though I thought it might help .
PUFF: When she came to work with Nathan , she seemed different , gentlemen , I do n't know , somehow soulless .
NATHAN: Bravo to you , Puff !
LILA: That was wonderful !
GABRIELLE: You were wonderful today , darling . Such authority with the ape-man boy . It made me so hot for you .
NATHAN: Unnhh .
GABRIELLE: The way you are taming him , it sends chills down my girlish spine and everywhere else , too .
NATHAN: Urgh .
GABRIELLE: Take me , darling ! Tame your little monkey of love !
LILA: Well , I 'm tamed , Dr. Bronfman . Nathan stares up at the ceiling .
NATHAN: I 'm glad my assistant .
LILA: Oh boy !
PUFF: Oh boy !
NATHAN: Now , Puff , we 're leaving on the electronic collar . I do n't think we 'll need to shock you , but just in case .
PUFF: Okay . That 's fair .
NATHAN: No , Puff ! Bad !
PUFF: My apologies , madam .
LILA: It 's okay , Puff .
PUFF: Sha n't happen again .
NATHAN: This is great , Puff . You 're doing fine .
PUFF: I 'm loving this . It 's such a treat to be out and about . What a wonderful invention a city is . The immense uildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun , the smartly dressed women in their best summe frocks , the colorful street vendors . The waitress comes by .
WAITRESS: How is everything ?
PUFF: Just spectacular . Great salmon . Fantastico ! You 've got to give me the recipe ! My compliments to the chef !
WAITRESS: I 'm glad you
NATHAN: Puff , no !
WAITRESS: And will that be all today ?
PUFF: It sha n't happen again . I swear it . I 'm just getting my sea legs , you know .
LILA: It 's an animal urge , Puff . It 's nothing to be ashamed of .
NATHAN: Lila ! Tell him . Lila looks at Nathan , amends her statement .
LILA: You just have to control it . We 're not apes .
NATHAN: Thank you very much for that .
PUFF: I do n't think this aversion therapy is really necessary , doctor . I understand the problem .
NATHAN: Humor me , Puff . It 's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world .
PUFF: I bow to your expertise in these matters .
NATHAN: Lila ?
PUFF: Eh .
NATHAN: Excellent work , Puff . Extra desert tonight .
PUFF: Yahoo !
NATHAN: Tomorrow , the acid test .
CHESTER'S WAITRESS: How you all doin ' today ?
NATHAN: Very well .
LILA: Very well .
PUFF: Very well .
CHESTER'S WAITRESS: Good enough ! What can I get for you ?
NATHAN: Puff , why do n't you order first ?
PUFF: Uh , what 's a Reuben , please ?
CHESTER'S WAITRESS: The what , honey ? Oh , the Reuben ? That 's a sandwich with corned beef and sauer
PUFF: That 's fine . That 's what I 'll have . Corned beef is a good food .
NATHAN: Puff , I 'm proud of you ! You did emarkably well under difficult circumstances .
LILA: Absolutely ! Puff jumps up and down excitedly .
PUFF: Did I ? I tried so hard ! I really concentrated ! Oh , I 'm so happy !
NATHAN: And because you did so well , we have a little surprise for you .
PUFF: Extra dessert ?
NATHAN: Even better .
PUFF: It 's wonderful ! Do you think I 'm eady ? Do you really ?
NATHAN: I trust that you 'll make good , mature decisions . I trust that you 'll do the proper thing .
PUFF: Oh , I will ! Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me . I do n't want to disappoint you .
NATHAN: Good . Remember , when in doubt Do n't ever do what you really want to do .
PUFF: Got it .
NATHAN: I 'm going to go down and check on Puff . See how he 's holding up .
LILA: Should I come with ?
NATHAN: Nah . You just relax . How 's the book ?
LILA: Ummm . It 's good . Nathan kisses Lila on the forehead .
NATHAN: I wo n't be long .
GABRIELLE: You 're kidding ! Holy shit . Yeah , no duh ! I had a wild hair up my ass over that for a month . There 's a knock at the door .
NATHAN: Please . Just one minute of your time .
GABRIELLE: Like what ?
NATHAN: Well , I think
GABRIELLE: You heard me ! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you ! Go away from here !
NATHAN: Well , look , I 'm sorry to have bothered you . He starts to head down the hall .
GABRIELLE: Well ?
NATHAN: God , you 're beautiful .
GABRIELLE: Please . I look a mess .
NATHAN: No . You look so beautiful .
GABRIELLE: Anyway . Come already to the point .
NATHAN: I 'm I 'm going to leave Lila . I ca n't stop thinking about you .
GABRIELLE: I 've moved on .
NATHAN: No !
GABRIELLE: I 've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry .
NATHAN: That goddamn Neanderthal ? I 'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen ! Did you know that ? !
GABRIELLE: That 's not how he tells it .
NATHAN: Of course not , that Swedish thief ! He 's a thief of hearts ! I love you , Gabrielle .
GABRIELLE: Hunh .
NATHAN: Just give me some time to let Lila down easily . She 's a really nice girl and I do n't want to hurt he more than is necessary .
GABRIELLE: You hurt me , you know , when you made Nathan 's Choice . Does that not even matter to you , you pig ?
NATHAN: Can you ever forgive me ?
LILA: You were gone a long time .
NATHAN: Yeah . Puff and I got into a big , philosophical discussion . He 's really quite well read , considering he 's only been literate for a month now . He 's going to make us famous , Lila .
LILA: So he 's doing okay ?
NATHAN: Seemed fine . Quiet evening enjoying his new digs .
LILA: That 's funny because , you know , I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside . He called here when he ran out of his `` mad '' money after spending an entire evening drinking , watching strippers , and fucking a whore ! Oh , and what did you do tonight , honey ?
NATHAN: Shit .
LILA: And what did you do tonight , honey ?
NATHAN: I 've fallen in love with somebody else , Lila .
LILA: And what did you do tonight , honey ?
NATHAN: I fucked her ! Okay ? I fucked her . I 'm sorry . But that 's what the hell I did .
LILA: Do you know what I gave up to be with you ?
NATHAN: Yes .
LILA: I gave up my soul , my beliefs . I gave up my body hair !
NATHAN: Yeah , well , I 'm sorry . The human heart is a strange thing .
LILA: How the hell would you know anything about the human heart ?
NATHAN: Lila
LILA: How 's that for ladylike , Nathan .
ROSE: Nathan told my brother .
LILA: Your brother should have his license evoked .
ROSE: Yeah , although I 'm not going to turn him in . I like hearing the dirt .
LILA: Why did n't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair ?
ROSE: I do n't know , honey . I do n't know . Maybe he just did n't want to get involved .
LILA: Oh , Rosie .
ROSE: Let 's get you out of here . Come stay with me until you get your strength ack . Free electrolysis , if you want it ! We 'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time .
LILA: Yeah . I got ta get myself together . I want to look good . If I 'm gon na fuck with Nathan , and I am , I want him to want to fuck me when I do it .
BEARDED PSYCHOLOGIST: and so without further ado , I give you Dr. Nathan Bronfman and Puff .
NATHAN: Thank you . Let 's get right to it . Here we have Puff the day of his capture .
PUFF: It would be my pleasure , doctor . Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community , I stand before you today , a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman . To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would e a vast understatement . Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces , then to crayons , and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline , Joseph Beuys , and Marcel Duchamp . From compulsive masturbation to
GABRIELLE: You were wonderful !
NATHAN: Was I ? I was n't a tad stiff ?
GABRIELLE: Do n't be silly ! And you were wonderful , too ! I loved the way you said `` au revoir . ''
NATHAN: Come on , you two . Let 's go celebrate !
NATHAN: Now the tango .
PUFF: To be taken from the depths of ignorance and depravity and raised to heights of culture and refinement ! This is the priceless gift bestowed upon me by Dr. Nathan Bronfman . Thunderous applause .
ROSE: Done !
LILA: Ready !
GABRIELLE: So we 've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements , my wonderful men .
NATHAN: Terrific . We 're all going to be rich and famous . Nathan kisses Gabrielle .
PUFF: Thanks to you , Nate .
NATHAN: Thanks to you , Buddy . And you diligence and intelligence and perseverance . Puff blushes .
PUFF: here , here .
MIDGET: Excuse me , are you Dr. Bronfman ?
PUFF: Is that a little boy ?
NATHAN: No , Puff . This man is a midget . In actuality , they prefer to be called `` Little People . '' Is n't that correct , my good man ?
MIDGET: Yes sir . Little People .
NATHAN: This Little Person is actually a fully grown adult man , Puff , believe it or not , who , due to a genetic anomaly , is miniature but perfectly proportioned . Turn , please . The midget turns .
PUFF: Interesting .
NATHAN: Now , my diminutive friend , what can I do for you ? The midget pulls out a gun .
MIDGET: You can get into that goddamn Lucite achelor pad for starters , Goliath .
NATHAN: What is this about ? We have no money on these premises . Please if you are from some little person terrorist fringe group
MIDGET: Shut up !
NATHAN: Lila ?
GABRIELLE: That 's Lila ?
LILA: Shut up ! Yeah , this is Lila , cunt . And do n't let the hirsutism fool you . I know more about being a woman , and more about the black hearts of men than you , in your pretty little powdered , bullshit fantasy world , can ever imagine . I know the darkness and cruelty of nature , sweetie pie .
NATHAN: Lila , you do n't intend to hurt us , do you ?
LILA: Eat shit , thumbtack dick ! Thank you , Frank . You 're the best .
MIDGET: Anything for you , Lila .
LILA: See , Frank and I are kindred spirits . We both know what it 's like to be shunned because of our appearance . We both know how easily that turns into self-hatred .
MIDGET: Amen . Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition !
ROSE: Sorry I 'm late , parking is a bitch at this place .
LILA: Uh , tie them up , Rosie . If you will .
ROSE: With pleasure .
LILA: Oh , Rosie .
ROSE: And I 'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me .
LILA: Shut up , you . Lila laughs and hugs her .
ROSE: I like you so much , with or without hair . But do n't spread that around . Bad for business .
LILA: I 'm really glad you two found each other .
MIDGET: We 're soul mates .
ROSE: Souls have nothing to do with it , abe .
LILA: I 'll be in touch .
ROSE: No you wo n't . But it 's okay . You have stuff you got ta do .
LILA: Got ta go .
PUFF: But I like being human now . Lila shocks Puff . He falls to the ground .
LILA: You what ?
PUFF: I want to be the way I was before .
LILA: Good . I 'll show you how , apey .
PUFF: Nice night .
LILA: Talking is to be kept to a minimum . Eventually , when we are ready , there will be none . Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves . There is no other reason .
PUFF: I agree ? Lila shocks Puff .
LILA: You lose . Any answer is the wrong answer .
PUFF: What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together .
GABRIELLE: A penny for your thoughts , mon cheri .
NATHAN: I do n't know . Something 's missing .
MOTHER: How did you know we
FATHER: It 's going famously , son , famously !
NATHAN: I 'm glad .
MOTHER: Harold , ask Nathan what 's wrong .
GABRIELLE: Yes , please , somebody ask him what is wrong .
NATHAN: I do n't know .
GABRIELLE: Oui .
NATHAN: That bitch . I worked so hard . We worked so hard , you and I . He would 've made us famous .
GABRIELLE: We still have you and I .
NATHAN: I know . And that 's great . But it would be great in a better way , not a better way but a different way , if I could find him and bring him back .
GABRIELLE: Where do we look for little lost Puff ?
NATHAN: I have some thoughts . I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape .
GABRIELLE: That is horrible . Apes are dirty . No ?
NATHAN: You better believe they 're dirty ! And smelly ! And messy ! And they do n't know their forks from their assholes !
GABRIELLE: Okay , my sweet . Good night .
NATHAN: A little resistance would be nice , damn it .
GABRIELLE: Please let me go with you .
NATHAN: No .
GABRIELLE: Okay .
NATHAN: Aha !
LILA: It was paradise . At least for a tiny little while .
NATHAN: Aha ! Finally . I 've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio .
LILA: Ugnh .
PUFF: Ugnh .
NATHAN: Oh please , is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you ? We 've discussed Wittgenstein , for Christ 's sake . Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject .
PUFF: Unn .
NATHAN: Down from the tree . Both of you . Keep your hands where I can see them . Do n't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur .
LILA: Oook . Oook .
NATHAN: Shut up ! I gave you life . I created you in my image , Puff . I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners . And this is how you repay me ? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get ? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman . It would serve you right , you ungrateful piece of crap . But I 'm not going to . You 're too valuable to me . Totally selfish of me . You serve my purpose . But if you had any smarts you would ealize that I serve your purpose as well . Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit .
LILA: Ooka .
NATHAN: Do n't worry , Lila . You can stay . I do n't have any interest in you anymore . C'mon , monkey boy .
PUFF: Ounpoo . Ungh .
NATHAN: Let 's be reasonable human beings here . We 're all reasonable human eings , are n't we ?
PUFF: Unka unka unka unka unka .
NATHAN: Look , why do n't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life . I 'll just go on my way . You 'll neve see me again .
PUFF: I have to talk . Is that okay ? Lila nods .
NATHAN: No .
LILA: Puff , do n't .
PUFF: Then Lila shot Nathan .
NATHAN: Then Puff shot me . Then I died . That 's all I know . That 's the end of my story . Do I get to go to heaven now ? Or is it hell ? Or what ? I just stay here , is it ? I just stay here and tell it again ? And afte that ? Again ? And after Yes . Yes , of course . We move into an extreme close-up .
LILA: He 's dead .
PUFF: We bury the body . We disappear into the woods . Nobody knows .
LILA: No . This is the end of the road . There 's a dead human being here . Fo all of his faults , he was a human eing , and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody .
PUFF: Forget him , Lila . We 'll disappear . We 'll never talk about it again . We 'll never talk again period . I love you .
LILA: Puff , what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan 's . Maybe more so , because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway . I 'm taking responsibility for the murder . I want you to go back to your old life .
PUFF: I wo n't let you do that . I shot the astard . And I 'm glad .
LILA: No . Go back to the woods . This is a sacrifice I need to make . In my world we have something called penance . It 's another abstraction , but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent . It does n't exist for you , and it should n't . See , I could never be free again anyway , so I might as well be in jail .
PUFF: Then I 'll live for both of us , Lila . I 'll be the most free , truest animal in the whole forest . For both of us .
LILA: That 's what I 'm counting on .
PUFF: But first I 'll live among them , just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind .
LILA: Okay . If you think it will help .
PUFF: And so , gentlemen , that is my story . I agreed to testify before this committee because I hoped to convey to the American public that there is indeed a paradise lost . Human beings have become so enamored of thei technologies and their intellectual prowess and their fancy gourmet foods , that they 've forgotten to look to the Earth as a teacher . This is hubris , my friends . And my story of destruction and betrayal is proof of that . I will keep my promise to Lila . I will shed this suit and go back into the wilderness . I will live out my days naked and free .
CONGRESSMAN: Thank you , sir . Your story has touched us all deeply . We will pass some legislation addressing this problem .
PUFF: Thank you . That is all I ask . Good-bye , Lila . I take you with me in my untamed heart .
OLDER WOMAN: Wait !
PUFF: Yes ?
OLDER WOMAN: I saw you on C-Span . I 've been looking for you for thirty years . Then there you were , such a beautiful , beautiful grown man . The older woman starts to cry .
PUFF: Mother ?
OLDER WOMAN: Yes Derek .
PUFF: It 's a pleasure to meet you , mother . But I 'm an ape like dad was And I have to go back into the woods now forever .
OLDER WOMAN: Yes , I suppose so . I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say . It 's good to see you again though .
PUFF: Yes .
OLDER WOMAN: I 'm in the book , if you ever want to drop me a line or something .
PUFF: I 'm an ape , mom . I 'm an ape . And apes do n't drop lines .
GABRIELLE: Hello , my little boy .
PUFF: Hey , ma . Did you bring any clothes ? I 'm freezing my ass off .
GABRIELLE: Oui . Nathan 's silk suit , just like you asked .
PUFF: Great . God , I 've wanted you forever . Gabrielle giggles . Puff kisses her .
GABRIELLE: Say my name .
PUFF: Gabrielle .
GABRIELLE: You remind me so much of Nathan .
PUFF: Like father , like son .
GABRIELLE: You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie .
PUFF: Woof .
GABRIELLE: Hush . No , it is never terrible to be in love . Nathan 's memory lives on in our sacred union . I 'm not sorry she killed him either . Nathan was wonderful . He was erudite and sophisticated and charming . You are all that , too . But you have something more . You have a bit of the animal in you .
PUFF: Let 's go eat , I 'm starved .
GABRIELLE: French ?
PUFF: Oui .

SALLY: Where are you going ?
RYAN: I have to go on a business trip and you have to go to sleep or when you grow up you 'll only be two inches tall .
SALLY: Stanley keeps waking me up .
RYAN: What 's the matter , Stanley ? Are you nuts or something ?
SALLY: He 's not , nuts . He 's lonely .
SLYLY: He needs a brother . If he had a brothe then he could go to sleep better .
MARGARET: We are never going to make it .

RYAN: Wo n't do me any good -
MARGARET: Jack .
SHEEPISH: OK . I ll try .
" MARGARET: You only have three minutes .
GIG: Hey.. If I 'm lucky , might miss the damn plane altogether .
STEWARDESS: Can I get you anything , sir ?
STEWARDESS: Why do n't you try to sleep ? The l f ight will go much faster .
SWALLOWING: Turbulence . You know . When sola adiation heats the earth 's crust . Warm air rises . Cool air descends . Turbulence . I do n't like it .
STEWARDESS: Are you a scientist ?
RYAN: No . I just read a lot of books .
STEWARDESS: Well , try and get some sleep anyway .
RESPECTFTAY: Mr. Ryan ?
GREER: Jack , boy . Get yourself in here .
SQUHTUNG: Jesus . You look like hell .
EGG: Thanks , Admiral .
GREER: Come on over here and sit down . You want coffee ?
RYAN: I think I need ooffiae .
GREER: I 'm not gon na ask you how you 11 flight was . When 's the last time you slept ?
EYEING WATCH: Do n't know . This thing is still on London time .
GREER: How 's Margaret ?
RYAN: Fine . She sends you her best .
GREER: And Sally ? What is she now , three ?
RYAN: A very precocious five . A week ago she announced her life would e a loot less lonely if Margaret and I would buy her a baby brother .
SMILING: Where you gon na do that ?
RYAN: British Intelligence received these two days ago . She 's the Red October . The Soviet 's newest typhoon .
GREER: Jesus . The Brits actually got a man into the construction shed ?
PHOTOS: This pair was digitally enhanced fo line resolution . This one for color .
RYAN: Twelve meters longer than the normal typhoon , three meters wider . The captain 's name is Ramixts .
GREER: One of yours ?
RYAN: Yes , sir . I did the bio on him last year . He 's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for ten years . Fairly good political connections . He 's also trained most of their attack boat skippers . They can him the Vilnius schoolmaster .
GREER: What are these doors ?
RYAN: The doors , Admiral , are the problem . I do n't know what they are and neithe do the English .
SIPPING CAFFEE: it 's just pole our friends at the Ustinov Design Bureau have come up with something new .
BEAT: With your permission , I 'd like to show these to someone . Do you know Skip Tyler ?
GREER: Sub driver . Did he get hurt or something ?
NODDING: He was Captain on an attack boat . Got clipped by a drunk driver and lost a leg . Now he 's teaching at the Academy and doing some consulting for Underwate Systems Command .
RYAN: Right now if it 's OX with you ? 've . never met him personally , but -
GREER: I 'll take care of it .
THE PHONE: Margie , have a car for Dr. Ryan at the front gate in tan . minutes .
SHOCKED: They should n't have been sea ready for weeks .
GREER: Relax , son . The Navy 's got a Las Angeles c'la'ss sittJng right off their doorstep . In a few days we 'll know everything about her but the wok 's name .
RYAN: Well , In that case
GRINNING: Can you tell me where I can buy a ear ?
GREER: For Sally ?
RYAN NODS: Same place you buy a baby brgther , I guess .
BEAUMONT: No . Maybe . It 's buried in
LEADING: Yes ?
BEAUMONT: Surface clutter ? I should go to SAPS ?
JONES: Correct , Seaman Beaumont . Surface Affects Processing . There is hope fo your small brain yet .
BEAUMONT GRINS: And like Mozart at Saltzburg , you have labored to produce
ANOTHER HOWL: hiclocdc .
JONES: A whale , Beaumont . A whale . A marine mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more about sonar than you do .
COB: He gets to raggin you too bad , kid , you can always ask him about Pavarattt..
BEAUMONT: Tell me , Chief .
COB: Well , Jonesy here , he 's a music freak , ight ? And he figures this sonar system is basically just a big old 300 million ddllar stereo unit . So he gets this piece of Pavarmt3i
JONES: it was Paganini .
COB: Whatever . It 's this piece of music he likes so much he wants to share it , ight ? So he re-wires the computer and figures how to put it in the water with a gigawatt of juice behind it .
BEAT: Now , the Captain , he do n't much care . But about twenty-one boats out of San Diego , including one way out at Pearl , starts hearing Pavarotti Doming out thei ass . Jonesy has turned the whole fucking Pacific Ocean into a stereo speaker .
LAUGHING: And all of a sudden we got an Admiral in the middle of it and we 're writing eports out the yang yang .
BEAUMONT: What should I
JONES: Be sti 1 , I got it .
JONES: Distant contact , submerged bearing zero- nine-seven . It 's a wild guess , but I 'd say we had a Boomer headed out of the barn .
MANCUSO: Start a plot , Jonesy . IM be there in a second .
MANCUSO: What do you have ?
RAMIUS: What are you doing ?
PT TIN: It 's my responsibility to oversee the stability of the crew , Captain . You know that .
RAMIUS: And you accomplish this by searching through my papers and invading my privacy ?
PUTIN: There is no such thing as privacy in the Soviet Union , Comrade . It 's antithetical to the oal ] ective good .
READING: `` I am coming soon . I will give to each according to his deeds . I am the eginning and the end . ''
GLANCING UP: Did you underline these passages ?
RAMIUS: The book belonged to my wife . I keep it only for sentimental value .
PUTIN: Your wife was a beautiful woman . A tragedy her life was cut so short .
TURNING: I assure you , Comrade . There 's nothing wrong with my mind .
PUTIN: Given the amount of fire power on Red October , I 'm sure the whole world will . eathe a cm1 eotive sigh of relief .
LKE ICE: How many more agents does the KGB have on my boat ?
STANDING: Captain , this is not your boat . It elongs to the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics . You would be well advised to remember that .
RAMIUS BLANCHES: Anyway , I am only a political odfioer . If the KGB has an agent on board , I would be the last to know .
RAMIUS: I suggest we open our orders .
PUTIN: As you wish .
RAMIUS: We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and endezvous with the Akula submarine , Konovalov .
PUTIN: Captain Tupalev 's boat .
RAMIUS: You know Tupolav ?
PU TIN: I know that he is descended from a long line of aril rats and that he was a student of yours . it is rumored , he has no love in his heart for you . Why is that ?
RAMIUS: There is no room in Tupolev 's heart for anyone or anything except Tupolev .
READING: Having made contact , we are ordered to run a series of drfl1 . Tupolev w2l hunt us while we test our ship .
PUTIN: Captain , this is an historic moment for all . of us . I should like to make a request .
RAMIUS: Before you do , I want to talk to you about something important .
NOT HEARING: I know that it is not aooording to protocxrl , but would you permit me to post the orders and inform the crew of our mission ?
RESIGNED: As you wash , Comrade .
TYLER: You 're never gon na go anywhere , Be.. Unless you close the hatch and start the goddam engine !
STEINER: Brilliant , Skip . You 're one of those guys you ca n't hide things from , right ?
TURNING: Ryan ?
RYAN: Yes sir . What it that thing ?
TYLER: Deep submergence rescue vehicle .
RYAN: That 's what a DSRV looks like .
TYLER: That 's it . I designed this one . lt 's aan d the Mystic .
RYAN: What are you doing with it ?
TYLER: Rigging it with a generic docking aclla so it will mate with British , German , other kinds of subs .
NODDING: This one here is designed to be supe mobile . We can get it anywhere in the world in twenty-four hours . If that lunatic does n't crash it fast .
BEAT: Admiral Greer says you have some pdr ures.- -
TYLER: Bigger than a regular typhoon .
GRINNING: You do n't miss much , do you ? They 're too big for torpedo tubes . Could you launch a missile horizontaly ?
TYLER: Could . Question is why would you ? Besides , they 're symmetrical right straight through the hull .
RYAN: How about a towed sonar array ?
TYLER: Barely clears the screw in the
RYAN: A what ?
TYLER: Caterpillar drive . Magnetohydrodynamic propulsion . Like a linear induction moto with saltwater as the ; tat-r. You follow ?
SMILING: Oh sure .
TYLER: Items like a jet engine for water . Goes in the front , gets squirted out the back . Only , It 's got no moving parts , see . So it 's ' potentially very quiet .
TYLER: Try silent If this works , we 'll have to find a whole new way to track submarines .
RYAN: it put to sea this morning .
HEAD: You know when I was eleven years old , I helped my daddy build a bom shelter in the basement because some fool parked a dozen warheads in Cuba , ninety miles from the Florida coast .
RYAN: Any records of our work on the caterpillar ?
CANE: We got an archive . Let 's get dusty .
RAMIUS: If I had n't spilled the tea , Putin might never have slipped and -
PETROV: You must not blame yourself , ,- Captain . Accidents happen . I assume we wall e returning to base ?
RAMIUS: We will not .
PETROV: But how can we continue a m scion without a political offcer ?
RAMIUS: For many years the Russian Navy went to sea before there were political offScers , Doctor .
PETROV: Yes , but -
LOGINAV DOES: Your name ?
TREMBLING: Cook 's assistant , Loginov , sir .
RAMIUS: Good . Now , I want you and the Docto to witness this , Ioginov . I have emoved Putin 's missfle key from his neck and am keeping it myse f .
PETROV: This is all very unnerving , Captain . The reason for having two missM keys in the first place is to prevent one person from
RAMIUS: From what , Doctor ?
PETROV: Making a mistake and
EXASPERATED: We must report this to Red Meet Command .
RAMIUS: Impossible . We are ordered to maintain strict radio silence .
TO IOGINOV: That will be all , Comrade .
PETROV: Captain , perhaps I should keep Putin 's key until
SHARPLY: I suggest you return to sick bay , Doctor . Soon , I will address the crew and explain our orders . This is not a decision for discussion .
LISTENING: He 's holding steady on zero-two-zero , twelve knots at about ten thousand yards .
MANCUSO: Can you identify him ?
JONES: Computer 's chewing on it . Twin screw and the plant noise sounds like a typhoon but -
MANCUSO: Must be a new boat .
TO THOMPSON: I miss something in dispatch the last few days , Phil ?
THOMPSON: Fleet has n't said a word about it .
MANCUSO: Alright . Start a f ] e on his , Jonesy . For now , call his Sierra thirty-five . 91 see if we can work in a little closer and sniff his out .
BEAUMONT: Wo n't the Soviets hear us ?
JONES: Not if we stay in his baffles , seaman Beaumont . Not if we stay in his affles . Come in behind his propelle and he 's deaf as a post .
RAMIUS: Down scope .
TURNING: Any . sonar contacts ?
KAMAROV: Sonar is clear , Captain .
RAMIUS: All right . rm going to address the crew .

IN ENGINEERING: beneath a maze of pipes , technicians listen
ON SPEAKERS: Once in the home waters of the enemy , we are to conduct a series of ine firing tests , targeting major cities on the enemy 's eastern seaboard .

TUPOLEV: What is it2l
BONAVIA: St M no sign of Red October , sir . I think we should surface and contact Red Fleet Command .
TUPOLEV: To what purpose ?
BONAVIA: To inform them Red October has not appeared .
TUPOLEV: What makes you think she has n't ?
TUPOLEV: I will not break radio silence . We wilt lie here quietly for a few more hours . If Ramius has n't arrived by then , I 'll contact Red Fleet Command .
BONAVIA: Captain , I am concerned that -
TUPOLEV: I Care little for your concerns , Comrade .

MANCUSO: Put it on the speakers .
JONES: Jeez . There 's another one . Bearing . , even-three .
MORE: Hold on . There 's two more out there . They 're all in a hurry and do n't care who the hell knows it .
TURNING: Have the Soviets scheduled submarine aces today , sir ?
MANCUSO: I 'm gon na radio Fleet Command .
RYAN: Yes ?
LISTENING: No , this is Dr. Ryan .
PAUSE: Affright . He stares at Tyler quizzically , waiting
FROM PHONE: Jack ?
RYAN: Yes , Admiral , I 'm -
GREER'S VOICE: Where the hell are you ? ! Get your ass to the south entrance of the Executive Offtce Buflding in forty-five minutes . It 's across from the White House . Got 3t
RYAN: Yes , sir , but what 's -
GREER: in his ofAce on the phone to Ryan
RYAN: I got a line on the doors . You know what they are ?
GREER: A silent propulsion system . -
CHAGRINED: How did - ?
GREER: Captain of the sub we had following her radioed in . Thing up and disappeared right in front of him . But that is n't the half of it . Read .
RYAN: Jesus ! This is unbelievable .
TURNING PAGES: The Kirov , too . They 've sortled their whale bloody fleet !
GREER: About the size of it .
RYAN: Where 're we going anyway ?
F IG: Brle $ ng Jeffrey Pelt . The . President 's National Security Advisor . Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there . Along with a few other people .
RYAN: Who 's giving the brieefing ?
GREER: You are .
GREER: The yeoman'fl have the slides all , laid out . AIL you have to do
PELT: Let 's get started .
GREER: Yes , sir . The preliminary briefing today w M be handled by Dr. Jack Ryan . I believe you 've seen some of his work .
TO RYAN: You may begin .
RYAN: Gentlemen , the last twenty four hours have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity . The first to sail was
SLIDE: this ship , the Red October . A variant of the typhoon class , she 's some six hundred fifty feet long . Thirty-two thousand tons submerged displacement , oughly the size of a World War II aircraft Carrier .
BEAT: Unlike the standard typhoon , equipped to fire long-range missiles from Russian waters , Red October carries fifty-six SS-311s , which is a short-range attack mis it with eight independent warheads . That 's four hundred forty-eight warheads all spedfically designed to fire close in .
ANOTHER SLIDE: We believe these doors on the bow , and here again on the stern , enclose a magneto-hydrodynamic drive , or caterpillar , which may allow the sub to run totally silent .
PELT: You would characterize this as a first strike weapon , Dr. Ryan ?
RYAN: There 's no doubt about that , sir . She is designed to approach by stealth , and fire on a target with little or no warning .
ADMIRAL: An offensive weapon . The kind you start wars with .
RYAN: Precisely , Admiral..
CHECKING NOTES: fifty-eight nuclei submarines headed at high speed into the Atlantic . And this afternoon 's satellite pass over Policjarny found head blooms in the engineering plants of the Kirov , the Minsk and more than twenty cruisers and destroyers , , indicating that the bulk of their surface fleet is also preparing to sail .
PELT: Conclusions ?
GREER: Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest this is probably just an exercise having nothing to do with the Red October .
MOORE: NSA can speak to that , Mr. Pelt .
MOORE: I must emphasize the extremi ' sensitivity of this information and ask that on no aooount it leave this room .
PELT NODS: Before sailing , Captain Ramius sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin , Chairman of Soviet Naval Deployment .
RYAN: That 's her uncle !
GREER: Whose uncle ?
WHISPEG: Ramius ' wife . Padorin 's her uncle !
MOORE: The contents of the letter are unknown , ut Admiral Padorin immediately demanded a meeting with Premier Ligachev and within minutes of that meeting , the Soviet Fleet sailed with orders to find Red October
PAUSE: And sink her .
PELT: Sink her ?
ADMIRAL: My god . They 've got a madman on their hands . He 's gon na start a war .
RYAN: This is the twenty-gird , is n't it ?
DRYLY: You 've something to add to the discussion , Dr. Ryan ? _
RYAN: UhhmmI was just thinking there was perhaps another possibility we ought to consider . Ryan takes a deep breath .
GENERAL: Do you mean to suggest -
PELT: Go ahead , Dr. Ryan .
RYAN: Well , Ramius trained most of their Office Corps . He 'd be in a position to sect men willing to help him . And he 's not Russian .
WARMING UP: He 's Lithuanian by birth , and by heritage . He was raised by his maternal grandfather , who was a fisherman . He has no children , no ties to leave behind and -
BEAT: This morning was the first anniversary of his wife 's death .
GENERAL: Oh , come on ! Look , what are you doing here , anyway , Ryan
TO GREER: That 's his name , is n't , Ryan ?
TURNING ': You 're just an analyst , right ? You ca n't possi , hly know
RYAN: I know Ramins , General . He 's . been a maverick for his entire career . I even met him once at an embassy dinner . �met captain Ramius , sir ? Have you eve
PELT: Bottom line , how long before Rami > us will e in a position to launch his misses at us ?
ADMIRAL: Four days .
PELT: Alright . I 'll brief the President . That will , be all , gentlemen .
BEAT: Dr. Ryan . Would you stay for a moment , please ?
GREER: I said speak your mind , Jack , but
PELT: You slammed the door on the General pretty hard , Jack .
RYAN: It was n't my intention , sir -
GRINNING: Yes it was . He was patronizing you and you stomped on him . In my opinion , he deserved It .
BEAT: Look , I 'm a politk ian , Jack . That means I 'm a liar , a cheat and when I 'm nvt kissing babies I 'm stealing their lallipops . But it also means I know people and keep my options open .
RYAN: Well , somebody has to go out and try- - to contact him .
PELT: OK . When can you leave ?
FLUSHED: Wait a minute . The General was right . I 'm just an analyst
PELT: Perfect . I ca n't ask any of these cha�tacters to go . None of them would volunteer putting their reputations on the line . And anyway , none of them are expendable .
RYAN FROWNS: IR ] . give you three days to prove your theory , after that we wo n't have any choice but to hunt Ramius down and blow him away . Will , you do it ? Ryan stares at Pelt .
TUPOLEV: Mother of God .
TURNING: Down scope . Dive the ship .
TUPOLEV: The entire Soviet Fleet has been ordered to hunt Ramius down and destroy him . And where were we ? Out of contact . Dead in the water !
BONAVIA: But , Captain . Have you forgotten that it was you who -
TURNING: I have forgotten nothing . All ahead flank . Come to course three-five-zero .
T BILLSI: Before we begin , Captain . I would like to know exactly what happened to Putin ?
BEAT: He did n't slip on his tea . Did he ?
RAMIUS: No , Vlktor . Visibly shaken , Stadnyuk waves his hands
STADNYUK: Captain ?
RAMIUS: There is no way we could have accomplished our task with Putin aboard . He would have stopped us .
T BILISI: I have no objections to eliminating him . He was a pig . But it 's a decision we should all have made .
BORODIN: You 're not in command .
T BILISI: Do n't give me that command garbage , Vasily . This is no ordinary cruise . We 're all risking our lives . Everything that happens affects-each of us .
RAMIUS: Enough ! Putin is dead . The responsibility and the guilt are mine .
PAUSE: There 's something else you should know . On the morning we sailed , I posted a letter to Admiral Padorin announcing our intentions to defect .
KAMAROV: In the name of God , why ?
RAMIUS: We needed to burn the bridges . Make a clean break .
SHRIEKING: They 'll find us ! They 'll hunt us down !
HISSING: Keep your voice down , Ivan . Nobody can find us .
TO RAMIUS: You had to do it , did n't you ? You could n't ` just fallow the plan and turn the ; submarine over to the Americans .
VOICE RISING: You had to rub Moscow 's nose in it and make some kind of hare-brained political statement .
ANGRY: Goddammit , Marko . You signed ou death warrants !
EYES BLAZING: How many times have you served in my command , Viktrxr ?
STAMMERING: Many times
RAMIUS: Do you know me to be a man who talerates insubordination ?
BORODIN: You heard the Captain . Dismissed !
RAMIUS: Our original orders were to demonstrate that this ship can not be found .
BEAT: That is precisely what we will do .
NAVIGATOR: Some turbulence . Hey , Commander ?
NO ANSWER: You do n't enjoy flying ?
SWOONING: Next time you get a bright idea , Jack , try putting • it in a memo .
NAVIGATOR: Anyway , when we hit that typhoon everybody knew what everybody else had for breakfast . Puke was on the ceiling . Puke was in the ais1 s Ryan is green .
USS KENNEDY: The North Atlantic 100 miles south of Greenland-
DAVENPORT: Charles Davenport , commanding office of the Kennedy ! The Admiral is waiting for you in his quarters !
RYAN;': dng hands ) Jack Ryan , Admiral.. Sorry for the confusion , but , as -l was just . telling Captain Davenport , I 'm not a naval of ce
BEAT: I work for Admiral Greer at the . CIA . He thought I would draw less attention if I.was in uniform .
RYAN DOESN'T: Alright . What can I do.for you , son ? You gon na tell me what all this activity is about ?
TO MANCUSO: I know you 're busy , Captain . But I may have something here .
MANCUSO: Go ahead .
JONES: I 've been working on a sound I heard when the typhoon disappeared . I washed it through the tape machine several times and managed to isolate it . But when I asked the computer to identify it , the answer I got . was magma displacement .
MANCUSO: Magma displacement ?
JONES: Yes sir . See , the system we are using was originally- designed to look four seismic events and although we adapted it . to hunt for submarines -
MANCUSO: utto the chase , Jonesy._ . ,
JONES: Aye , aye , sir . Anyway , ; I got curious , and . started tracking . the sound on ou lateral array . I located it fou different times . The fifth time it was gone and I could n't find it . But I want to show you what I worked up .
DRAWING LINE: Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was earing two-six-zero . And at zero-nine- forty-eight is was two-ive-zero .
ANOTHER LINE: I came back to it at about ten-hundred and the bearing was two-four-two . The last signal was real faint and I did n't have a very good lock on it .
MANCUSO: So ?
JONES: Well , I figure it could n't be very fa away from us , right ? Let 's say it was halfway between us and Iceland . That would put it on a course like this .
MANCUSO: Headed directly into Red Route One .
JONES: Exactly . Sir , I believe the sound I heard is the acoustical signature of some kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and he 's taking the inshore track off the Iceland coast .
THOMPSON: What do you think , captain ?
MANCUSO: Let me see if I got this straight . The three minion dollar computer tells you you 're chasing after an earthquake and you are n't convinced . So you get curious and came up with this theory on your own ?
UNCERTAIN: Yes , sir .
MANCUSO: Relax , Jonesy . You sold me . Jones grans .
JONES: Yes , sir . Now that I know what to listen for , I ' 1 bag the sucker cold .
RYAN: Not ne s_~ 4 ' y . If he personally ecruita d the of6cers , it 's theoret i ally
DAVENPORT: Theoretically , anything 's p • But you 're not in some cubicle at CIA .
RYAN: Perhaps it would be enough to get some I men aboard to analyze the propulsion
RYAN: Perhaps . I 'm not sure that -
RYAN: Ca n't remember . Every time I get . the chance , somebody puts me on anothe airplane .
STANDING: We 'll be in CIC in the morning . It 's gon na get real interesting out here the ' next couple of days .
DAVENPORT DIDN'T: Class of M. Marine Corps .
MUMBLING: Got ta be pie Anything 's possible Under the guise of Coast Guard etter to keep it.. how do you keep ft ? Ryan 's sound asleep .
TECHNICIAN: Converter temperature'is egress above specks and rising !
SHOUTING BACK: What 's the status of the cryog
SHOUTING: Liquid helium discharge pressure is one . hundred pounds low and drpl g !
RAMIUS: What is It ?
SHOUTING BACK: he cryogenic plant has failed ! The super conducting magnets are not being cooled and the temperature of the . caterpiar assembly is rising to dangerous levels.. If we do n't turn It , off , it 's gon na melt !
TO TECHNICIAN: Shut everything down ! Ship SHUDDERS . Technicians work at a feve
TECHNICIAN: Caterpi ' ] ] ar flows are stabilizing .
BEAT: Magnet temperatures are dropping .
SCARED: Any reactor damage ?
MELEKHIN: There was a power spike , but the eactor scrammed itself automatically .
PETROV: But are there any radiation
ANGRY: I. do n't know , dammiti
RAMIUS: How long before you can fix it ?
MELEKHIN: I have to find out what 's wrong first . It could be a problem with the liquid helium cycle . Maybe the super conducting material has failed .
RAMIUS: We 're going to have to run an normal propuLainn . Can you get the reactor up ?
RAMIUS: That will be all , Doctor .
BORODIN': What if we 're detected , Captain ?
RAMIUS: Pray that we are n't , Vasily .
PELT: Forgive me , Ambassador , for dispensing with the usual formalities . But the President views this situation as critical . Our m,7 ttary counts thirty-two of you anti-submarine aircraft in the sky laying down enough sonar buoys that a man could walk from Greenland to Norway without getting his feet wet . What 's going on ?
LYSENKO: we fear she may . be down . Lysenko leans forward
PELT: So do I , Ambassador Lysenko . Confusion could be
CAREF'ULLY: Catastrophic .
AMALRIC: Sonar contact on buoy number one- seven-nine . Contact is twenty-seven mil southwest , ze o-nine-zero . Data indicates contact is Red October .
TO COPILOT: Contact Red Fleet Command and r2con8rm . our orders .
COPILOT: Red Fleet Command , this is Bear Foxtrot two-eight-four . We have contact evaluated as Red October . Request conformation to attack ?
TURNING: Captain , orders to attack are confirmed .
PILOT: Arm . the weapons .
COPILOT: Weapons are armed . All pre-launch check is satsfactcry .
MELEKHIN: Captain , I need -
BORODIN: Dammit , Alex . If we run any longer on normal power , weft have the w-hole -
ON SPEAKERS: Captain , sonar ! We have just been overflown by a low altitude multi- engine turboprop !
GRABBING MIKE: Put it on audio .
ON SPEAKERS: Several short transients are close aboard . Could be water entry of small objects !
RAMIUS: All stop !
TO MELEKHIN: We have just run out of time , Comrade . Get us out of this mess . And hurry !
MELEKHIN SPLITS: Quartermaster , sounding ?
NO ANSWER: Dammit , Ivan . Give me a sounding !
STAMMERING: There are five hundred meters unde the keel..
TO COPILOT: Ask God for forgiveness , Comrade .
ON SPEAKERS: High speed screw l Torpedo in the water !
ON SPEAKER: Captain , this is the torpedo room . Counter-measure has been launched .
RAMIUS: Bottom the ship .
STADNYUK: Wait !
RAMIUS: You 're relieved of your duties , Ivan ! Return to your quarters .
BEAT: Now !
ON HEADSET: Weapon has locked onto target and is homing .
KAMAROV: Four hundred meters .
LISTENING: Searching .
ON SPEAKERS: Torpedo has passed over us . It 's hunting for a target .
READING: Four hundred fifty meters . Estimate ottom at five hundred meters .
HELMSMAN: We 're flooding !
KAMAROV: Keep your teeth on the shelf , boy . Nobody 's flooding .
READING: Passing four hundred seventy-fve meters . Estimate bottoming in twenty-five meters .
ON SPEAKER: Captain , the torpedo is homing on our counter-measure !
HELMSMAN: Captain , who 's shooting at us ?
KAMAROV: Easy , boy .
ON SPEAKERS: Captain , the caterpa ` llar is fixed . silent drive is operational .
RAMIUS: This Is the Captain . The explosion you Just heard was the first operational test of a new counter-measure . The torpedo was launched by our friends in Soviet aviation . Borodin stares at Ramius
TO KAMAROV: Pump us off the bottom and engage the c�taerpa'T ] ar . Nobody moves . Ramius is indomitable
TO PLANESMAN: Pump auxiliaries to sea . Twenty thousand pounds .
NO RESPONSE: Now !
MELEKHIN: Someone rigged the pipe so that when we took a down angle it would fall into the gears .
MELEKHIN: No doubt about it . And whoever it was knew exactly how to cripple the caterpillar in a way not easy to find .
BEAT: I st ] ] . do n't know if there 's any react= damage . I9 ] . have to take a sample of the axilant . - We are dealing with no ordinary sailor .
RAMIUS: We21 . have to find a way to get the crew off this ship , now . We are in dange every second they are aboard .
BORODIN: But , Captain . There 's over a hundred of them .
BEAT: How do you get the crew off a nuclea submarine ?
COB: Where is your phantom Russian sub , Jonesy ? According to your calcuiat£ons we ' should have picked him up hours ago .
JONES: He 's close . I can feel it .
COB: Close do n't count in anything but horseshoes and hand grenades . Beaumont CHORTLES . Jones glances at him
JONES: Do n't encourage the man , seaman Beaumont . He 's very old .
COB: Screw you .
JONES: Speaking of which , what happened to that Hustler Magazine that was in the head ?
BLANCHING: Do n't start on that crap .
M AY: What Hustler magazine ?
JONES: For many months , seaman Beaumont , there was a Hustler magazine located in the crew 's head . it was community property .
WORKING SONAR: Then one day , it disappeared . The ..COB . here was the last person seen entering the head before it vanished .
BEAUMONT: Where 'd it ' go ?
SQUIRMING: Come on , Jonesy .
JONES: I have a theory , seaman Beaumont . I believe the CO B Is like a black widow , spider . After he has sex with a magazine , he eats it . Beaumont HOWLS . The COB turns pink .
COS: Goddam you , Jonesy
HAND: Wait !
RYAN: Morning , Admiral .
PIG: The majority of their Northern Fleet surface vessels are moving in a line abreast through here .
BEAT: It 's an old anti submaxlne tactic . Like eaters in the jungle making a lot of noise , driving the prey into the guns of waiting hunters .
PIG: One of our submarines , the Da71as , reports intermittent contact with Red October and is positioned here at the bottom of Red Route One . With luck , the Dallas will inte pt her .
RYAN: Could you get me aboard the Dallas ?
ASHEN: No other way ?
FLY: Memos . From now on nothing but memos .
TO MANCUSO: Captain , we 're about a thousand yards on Red October 's port quarter . She 's tracking on course two-one-zero , eight knots .
ON MIKE: Conn , sonar . Signal to noise ratio is dropping .
BEAT: Possib3e aspect change on Sierra thirty-five , Red October .
THOMPSON: Sonar , Conn , aye .
FIRE CONTROL: Concur , possible zig . Bearing rate increasing to the right .
TO THOMPSON: All stop i Come left and stay in his affles .
F IG: Rig for quiet running . All compartments eliminate noise evolutions .
BEAUMONT: What ! s ' going on , Jonesy ?
WHISPERING: The Soviet Captain has a blind spot astern in his baffles and he 's turning suddenly to see if he can catch us there . It 's a trick the Soviets use called a crazy Ivan turn .
BEAT: Your average skipper might get caught with his pants down . Not Mancuso . We stop all engines and turn with him . Staying in his baffles . Quiet as a mouse .
BEAUMONT: Skipper got him . The Russian has n't got a clue .
FIRE CONTROL: Bearing rate has steadied . He 's eturning to course two-one-zero .
MAN CUSO: Very well . Secure from quiet running . RADIOMAN enters .
TO MANCUSO: Just decrypted this message from Fleet Command , sir . Opening the message , Mancuso scans it
MANCUSO: Damn !
THOMPSON: What ?
MANCUSO: ! re not gon na believe this .
DAVENPORT: The Dallas picked up Red October and is tracking her again . The Admiral issued orders for her to fall back and pick you up . Davenport takes Ryan 's arm .
LYSENKO: The weather in Washington is so unpredictable , do n't you think ?
PELT: How can I help you , Ambassador ?
LYSENKO: I 'm afraid there 's been a pew development .
PAUSE: Apparently , the initial reports that one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate .
PELT IS: silent ) , The . submarine in question , Red October , is commanded ' by a Captain Marko Ramius Apparently r he has suffered some kind of a nervous breakdown
SWEATING: He -posted a letter just before he announcing his intentions to fire his mis ' it at the United Stat s .
PELT: Why did n't you tell me this the last time we met ?
LYSENKO: In my position , I 'm sometimes compromised y the fact that Moscow does n't tea me everything .
PELT: So one of your submarine captains has gone insane ?
LYSENKO NODS: What is it you want from us ?
LYSENKO: The other day you offered your assistance
PELT: The other day it was a rescue mission . You want us to help you hunt Ramius down and kill . him ?
LYSENKO: Because American lives are at stake , I 've been instructed to ask you President for precisely that .
SWALLOWING: Since you were so adamant about the consequences of confusion , I thought we might ask him together .
PELT: I understand . Pelt picks up the phone .
COPILOT: no contact with the Da'Ha !
PILOT: We ca n't wait any Unger !
COPILOT: Hang on . I have contact !
PILOT: OK. Tell them to surface .
MANCUSO: Whoever this guy is , he 's in far one hell of a ride .
NG: Officer of the deck . Surface the ship .
SAILOR: Pull this to release !
MANCUSO: You got a man dangling at the end of a line with no paint of reference and helicopter rotors generating enough static electak ty that we have to ground him or it ! l be like grabbing a hot wire and if he falls in the wate the only way to get him out is with divers 'cause most of the ship 's underwater .
PAUSE: Fun ?
G NING: Why I joined the Navy . A sager hands Mancuso a phone for the bridge .
MANCUSO: Good . We got no idea who this guy is or why the Navy wants his on our boat so bad .
SAILOR: Hang on !
SCREAMING: See if you can get a ground on his line . I 'm gon na try and catch the bastard !
PILOT: Reel him back in !
TRYING: The cable 's jammed !
PILOT: If they do n't pick him up this time , we have to cut him Ioxe !
ON SPEAKERS: Man overboard ! Twenty yards off the starboard bow !
JONES: Are . you injured ! ?
RYAN: Wait a minute !
JONES: Listen , you son-af-a-bit h. I 'm only gon na tell you once . Stick this fucking thing in your mouth and breathe !
RYAN: Jesus Christ ! I cant believe it ! Jesus Christ »
MANCUSO: Take it easy
RYAN: When I hit the water , it was like Ice . I thought I was going to freeze
MANCUSO: Slow down . You 're hypervent it sting .
RYAN BLINKS: Now , who are you ?
DISORIENTED: Sorry . I 'm Jack Ryan . Are you Captain Mancuso ?
READING: I already found him , Ryan . Then I was ordered to pick you up .
QUIC DY: We have to find him again . The Captain is going to defect and -

JONES: No , sir , captain . operating as before .
OOD: Captain . Battle stations are manned .
MANCUSO: Very well .
RYAN: What do you mean battle stations ?
URGENTLY: Look , I 've been authorized by the President of the United States to talk to the Captain of Red October .
MANCUSO: And I have been ordered to blow him out of the water if he stays on a course to the United States o demonstrates any hostile intentions .
STUNNED: I do n't understand .
RYAN: Wail !
TO MANCUSO: Captain , crazy Ivan .
MANCUSO: All . stop i Come left and stay in his affles . Rig for quiet running .
RYAN: Listen to me , Captain . There must e some way you can establish contact without violating your orders . I 'm telling you , he wants to defect .
MANCUSO FROWNS: If there 's ever going to be peace in the world somebody has to take a risk . Give the man a chance . He 's defecting . I know it .
MANCUSO HESITATES: Please .
MANCUSO: AIL back two-thirds .
OOD: Sorry , sir . Would you repeat

MELEKHIN: Placing flask under valve four . Drawing sample .
PETROV: Shut the valve and secure the sink !
BORODIN: Do you think they will let me live in Montana ?
RAMIUS: I think they w91 let you live whereve you want , my find .
BORODIN: Good . Then I will raise rabbits in Montana and marry a round American
SMILING: And she will have friends who are Indians and we wiin ride horses on Sunday .
BABBLING: I knew we should have checked the eactor before we started it . When the caterpillar broke down the vare must have been damaged !
RANIUS: Keep your vcadoe down , Doctor . There are several explanations -
PETROV: Listen to me . Radioactive fuel is in the water . If it gets into our air , it could ' loll us all !
RAMIUS: I said , keep your voice down . The
SHRILL: I will not ! We have a level fou adiation leak . And if something is n't done , we 're all going to die ! -
RAMIUS: it 's probably a piece of corrosion in the pipes . That happens . Now let 's take ' another sample . But quietly . We do n't want to panic the crew .
MELEKHIN: I may have shut it too hard .
RAMIUS: Evacuate the compartment- '
MELEKHIN: in try and stop the leak . Everybody get the hen out of here !
ON HEADSET: Captain , radiation alarms are activating in all compartments . Engineering is heavily contaminated . Radiation is spreading forward !
RAMIUS: Get us to periscope depth.We ] i ventilate !
TURNING: Emergency surface !
READING: Ventilating wo n't do any good . Ws getting worse . At these levels it is only a matter of minutes . We have to abandon ship ! ; -
TO BORODIN: Alright . Pass word to abandon ship . Draft a message to Red Fleet Command telling them our location and situation !
RAMIUS: All right . Instruct the crew to secure the rafts to the deck . When all . personnel are aboard the rafts , we will scuttle the ship out from under us !
KAMAROV: Captain , Major Tbilisi reports the crew are secured in rafts and rafts are tied down . We should join the crew and scuttle the ship .
TO PETROV: Do you have a count ? Have they all een evacuated ?
PETROV: I think so . I

TRANSLATING: Red October . Stay where you are . Do not attempt to submerge or we will are . Stand by to be boarded .
SHRIEKING: What are we going to do ?
TO PETROV: There 's only one thing we can do . Go topside and take care of the crew . I and my officers wall submerge the ship and take her elsewhere to scuttle . The Americans must never have this boat !
TO BORODIN: Submerge the ship .
LISTENING: Copy that . We 're on our way .

TURNING: Four hundred yards from drop paint . Eight hundred yards . Twelve hundred yards .
CURRY: Torpedo has detonated .
GREER: And you understand , Lieutenant . I was never here . That torpedo did not self-destruct . It hit the target . Right ?
CURRY NODS: Now , Contact the Dallas and tell them to proceed . Curry nods .
THOMPSON: Frigate reports phase one completed , Captain . We are ordered to proceed .
MANCUSO: OK. Now comes the weird part . Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into
MANCUSO: I do n't like leaving the boat , Phil . But the orders are specific .
THOMPSON: We 're gon na be f ne . Rounding a corner , they start
MANCUSO: This has got to be the craziest stunt I 've ever heard of . There 's only about two ml ] ] k n things that can st ] l. go wrong . At the bottom of the ladder , they ente
MANCUSO: Listen . If anything
THOMPSON: Captain . We 'll be all right .
STEINER: OX . Passengers are aboard . Check-off complete . Request clearance to lift-off .
TURNING: Gentlemen , we have clearance . Fasten your belts and grab your nuts . We 're taking a ride .

RYAN: Russian Cigarette ?
BORODIN NODS: Could I try one ?
GAGGING: Jesus
RAMIUS: Gentlemen , I am Marko Ramius . I and my offers request political asylum in the United States .
BEAT: Before I go any further , I want to know whose idea is this impos.ih18 plan ?
TO RYAN: Amazing . our intention was to publicly surrender this boat and request asylum . it never occurred to us there would be a way you could keep it . The idea to stage a radiation leak was inspired
FROWNING: You look familiar . Do I know you , Commander ?
RYAN: You have a good memory , Captain . We meet briefly years ago . But I 'm not a naval commander . I work for the CIA .
RYAN: Easy , Captain . I 'm not an agent . I 'm just an analyst .
SMRNNG: I write books .
KAMAROV: Torpedo ! Americans are shooting at us .
JONES: Wrong . Ours growl . Yours whine . It 's Russian !
ON SPEAKERS: The weapon enabled on the other side of the target . It passed Red Octobe efore it armed .
TO BONAVIA: You had the wrong range , idiot ! Fire again with the right settings . And eload both tubes .
BEAUMONT: New oorrtact . Sierra four-one , bearing zero-one-zero . Aku ] a c1a.�.s Soviet submarine .
BEAT: Launch noises . He 's shooting again .
THOMPSON: What 's the status of Red October ?
BEAUMONT: Dead in the water .
THOMPSON: They ca n't maneuver with the goddam DSRV stuck to them .
WHISPERING: Come on , Mancuso , move it . Get the hell out of there .
RAMIUS: Get back to engineering and give me some power !
STEINER: I think somebody just shot a torpedo at us !
MANCUSO: No shit , buckwheat . Get the hell . out of here !
STUNNED: Where am I supposed
RAMIUS: No , Vasily . I need you in fire control . We must track whoever 's out there .
RAMIUS: Do exactly as I tell you !
ON SPEAKERS: DSRV is away . There 's a Russian Akula about eight thousand yards starboard .
TO RYAN: All ahead flank !
PANIC DNG: I told you I 'm just an analyst . I write books .
LEANING FORWARD: Turn that knob all the way to the right .
ON SPEAKERS: Torpedo in the water . High speed screws . Beaming zero-two-zero . I estimate range at about eight thousand yards .
TO RYAN: Turn the helm to the heft . Steer course zero-two-zero .
TO RAMIUS: Wait a minute ! That 's heading into the t o rpedo . You should turn away from it .
ON SPEAKERS: Steady bearing to the weapon . Still zero-two-zero . Range about seven thousand yards .
TO RYAN: Turn that helm to the left until the dial says course zero-two-zero .
MANCUSO: No ! That 's wrong . Ryan , do n't turn that goddam wheel !
TOO MANCUSO: Sorry , Captain . I think
TO RAMIIUS: You 're heading straight into that torpedo .
RAMIUS: I know .
EYES NARROWING: Red October is turning directly into the t orpedos path .
GREER: Mother of God .
ON SPEAKERS: Torpedo steady bearing zero-two-zero . Range five thousand yards .
ON MIKE: Me ] ekhin . Can you give me any more speed ?
ON SPEAKERS: Negative . We 're going as fast as we can .
THOMPSON: Why is he heading into the torpedo ? Is he trying to kill himself ?
COB: Mr. Thompson . We have a solution on the Soviet Akula . Should n't we shoot back ?
ANGRY: She did n't shoot at us . Anyway , I ca n't attack a Soviet submarine . I have no goddam authorization !
ON SPEAKERS: Torpedo bearing steady at zero-two- zero . Best range nine hundred yards . Estimate impact in twenty seconds .
TO RYAN: What books ?
RYAN: Pardon ?
ON SPEAKERS: Fifteen seconds .
RAMIUS: What books did you write ?
HOARSELY: I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey , called , Fighting Sailor . It was about tam in combat
ON SPEAKERS: Ten seconds .
RAMIUS: I know this book . I have read some parts of it .
RYAN BLINKS: Your conclusions were wrong , Ryan . Halsey acted stupidly .
RYAN: What happened ?
MANCUSO: Combat tack , Mr. Ryan . By turning into the torpedo , , Ramius closed the distance before it could arm itself . I never would have thought of it .
RYAN: So we 're safe ?
RAMIUS: Not yet . Right now , the Soviet Captain , a man named Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons . He wo n't make the same mistake twice .
BEAUMONT: Jesus Christ . Gunge .
THOMPSON: Gunfire ?
TUPOLEV: Hurry up goddammit ! I want all the enabling devices disconnected !
BONAVIA: Captain , I can not go any faster .
BORODIN: I would have like to have seen Montana . And the Indians . captain ? - _ .
KAMAROV: He 's in the missile compartment !
TO MANCUSO: The ship is yours .
MANCUSO: But the control is blasted to hell . I ca n't shoot .
RAMIUS: Then get behind him and stay there . Do n't let him put you in his sights or we 're all dead .
BONAVIA: Enabling devices are removed .
ON SPEAKERS: She 's taken position behind us .
TUPOLEV: Damn .
TO HELM: Left full rudder . T11 shake him loose .
RAMIUS: He 'll break into a panel and short -circuit the wiring on a missile . We 'll e blown to pieces .
RAMIUS: We must stop him before he gets into a panel..
TO HIMSELF: Next time memos . Only memos .
RAMIUS: Be careful what you shoot at in here , Ryan . The compartment is very sensitive .
RYAN: Be careful what you shoot at , Ryan . Very sensitive.. .in here
ON SPEAKERS: He 's going deep !
TO KAMAROV: Twenty degrees down on the bowl
RYAN: Sensitive stuffin here I have to be careful of course .
CURRY: The Akula is too fast . No way Red October can stay behind her . lt 's only a matter of time now .
BEAT: The Akula 's turning . She 's fired another torpedo . This one ca n't miss .
JONES: Another torpedo , Captain . It has enabled and is active . It has acquired us and is homing .
CURRY: Jesus Chi i t .
CURRY: The Dallas has moved between Red October and the torpedo . The torpedo is chasing the Dallas now !
BEAUMONT: Conn , sonar . Torpedo is in acquisition . Range five hundred yards and c3nsing . You 've done it , Mr. Thompson !
THOMPSON: Chief , release counter-measures and emergency blow all main valves . Let 's hope to Christ this works !
ON PHONE}: Signal ejector station . Release counter-measures .
PULLING HANDLES: Emergency blow !
BONAVIA: Directly ahead . Range five hundred yards .
TUPOLEV: Got him . Match bearings and the .
BONAVIA: We are too close . I have to set
TUPOLEV: Shoot now ! Tupolev pulls the lever himself .
ON SPEAKERS: Launch transient astern . He 's shooting again . Very close .
MANCUSO: Left full rudder !
LOUDER PINGS: Weapon is alive .
ON SPEAKERS: Weapon passed close aboard . Is Ong re-attack . Hold on . It 's eacquired . But not on us !
TUPOLEV: Wait . I -
OVER SPEAKERS: Our torpedo missed Red October and is homing on us !
STUNNED: How could that be ?
BONAVIA: The weapon was not properly programmed .
RAMIUS: Captain Tupalev has just provided you pantomime with the one thing you could never have managed .
NODDING: Wreckage .
PELT: in his office seated across from Lysenko
SOBERLY: This has been a terrible tragedy , Mr . Ambassador . I can only stress that if you 'd come to us earlier , it might have een avcdded .
LYSENKO: I appreciate your candor in the matter .
SMOOTHLY: And I yours , Andrei..
PROBING: Perhaps in the future , the technology will be available for a more thorough I n vestigation of the wreckage
STEADY: Perhaps .
LYSENKO: There is another matter One I am eluctant to -
PELT: No . Please go ahead .
LYSENKO: One of our submarines , an Akula , was last reported in the Reykjanes Ridge . We have not heard from her for sometime .
PELT: You 've lost another submarine ?
BEAT: Andre
LYSENKO: Shut up ! Do n't speak to me Boris . Do n't ever speak to me unless I speak to you first . And wipe that smile off your face !
RYAN: We 're two hundred miles from the nearest naval base .
RAMIUS: Interesting notion , hiding a submarine in a river .
EYEING SHORE: How do you know this place ?
RYAN: I grew up not far from here .
RAMIUS: There is one question you have not asked me .
RYAN: Why ?
RAMIUS NODS: I assumed you would speak when you were eady .
RAMIUS: We . are standing on part of the reason . I 've spent my life preparing to fight a war I hoped would never happen . This ship was not built to fight such a war . it was built to start one .
BEAT: And there were personal reasons .
RYAN: Your wife ?
NODDING: it started there , perhaps .
RYAN: Fishing ?
RAMTUS: Fishing .
QU`EDY: Welcome to the new world , sir .
TIME: BLACK SCREEN
THOMPSON: It 's to the left .
SANBORN: Going left .
THOMPSON: Up a little .
THOMPSON: Closer . I want to see the ojive . Zoom on the nose cone of the shell . The third soldier leans in for a better look .
SANBORN: I ca n't get it inside .
THOMPSON: Pretend it 's your dick .
SMILES: I 'm pretending it 's your dick .
THOMPSON: Let me try .
SANBORN: Give me a second .
THOMPSON: Give me a crack at it .
SANBORN: Shit . Okay .
THOMPSON: Hello mamma . See that ?
SANBORN: Looks like a one-five-five .
THOMPSON: Yeah . That can do some damage .
SANBORN: We 're going to need a charge .
ELDRIDGE: Figured four blocks . Hey with these four blocks and the ninety pounds , are we going to be far enough away ?
THOMPSON: The blast is going to roll out there the shell will probably kick out there , and most of the shrapnel is going to rain up in an umbrella pattern . Some smaller pieces and shell fragments will come out this way ut we 'll be okay if we are behind the truck .
ELDRIDGE: You know I 'll be behind the truck .
THOMPSON: Nothing wrong with that , Owen . Let 's get the area cleared ( looks around at the crowd
OF ONLOOKERS: as best we can , then load up the ot .
SANBORN: Damn .
SANBORN: Matt , the bot 's not going to do it .
THOMPSON: Keep trying .
THOMPSON: Okay , you 're right . I have to go down there - do n't you think ? Sanborn nods .
WRYLY: What , you do n't like it here ?
THOMPSON: Let 's just get me dressed .
THOMPSON: Watch it .
SMILING: I thought you already had you children , Sergeant .
THOMPSON: Need to keep my options open .
SANBORN: Ready ? Thompson nods .
THOMPSON: I 'm craving a hamburger , is that strange ?
SANBORN: Not for you . Happy trails .

HEADSET: We 're armed and ready to blow , Blaster Mike .
OVER WALKIE: Copy that . You coming back ?
HEADSET: Copy that , I 'm on my way .
ELDRIDGE: Hey Sanborn
TURNING: Yeah ?
ELDRIDGE: Butcher shop - dude has a phone .
SANBORN: He should n't be Eldridge is already moving towards the store .
ELDRIDGE: Hey - put that down
HEADSET: 50 meters . Why is Eldridge running ?
ELDRIDGE: Hey - put the phone down !
JAMES: Yeah .
SANBORN: Sergeant James . J.T . Sanborn . Welcome to Bravo Company and welcome to Camp Victory .
JAMES: Victory ? I thought this was called Camp Liberty .
SHRUGS: They changed it last week . Victory sounds better .
JAMES: It 's Will . Good to meet you J.T .
SANBORN: So , is that all you brought from Kabul ? James motions to the locker .
JAMES: Yeah . Here , give me a hand with this .
SANBORN: This should stop any lateral pieces .
JAMES: Yeah , I 'm good unless it comes through the roof in which case I 'm gon na need a closed casket .
SANBORN: The accent you from Georgia ?
JAMES: Tennessee . Trailer park off I-5 .
SANBORN: Oh , right . I 'm from Vermont . You know , `` live free or die . '' Trees . Snow . Maple syrup . Pot . James gives him a polite smile . Sanborn soldiers on

SANBORN: Anyway , the mess tent can be hard to find the first time so if you want we 're going ove there now to grab chow come along .
JAMES: Thanks . But no .
SANBORN: You want me to bring you back a urger or something ?
JAMES: Nah . I 'm good .
SANBORN: Yeah , he was . And he was a good team leader too .
JAMES: I know I ca n't fill his shoes , but I 'm here to try
SANBORN: Appreciate it .
JAMES: but you know , if it 's your time it 's your time . No man can change that .
PUZZLED: Yeah , I guess that 's true .
RECOVERING: So , we roll at oh-six-hundred .
JAMES: Looking forward to it .
ELDRIDGE: So ?
SANBORN: A good ` ole boy . You know , loves the Army , blood runs green . Country oy . Seems solid .
ELDRIDGE: I always liked southerners , fo some reason .
SANBORN: Then he 's just your type .
ELDRIDGE: Why is it always the gay jokes with you . It 's not even funny .
SANBORN: It 's your time it 's your time .
CONCERNED: He said that ? Sanborn nods .
ELDRIDGE: Where 's the FNG ?
JAMES: Gim me a minute .
ELDRIDGE: Those Abrams have been parked eve since I got here nine months ago , and I ai n't seen them move once . They should put those on eBay . Hey , J.T. , how much you think one of those would cost ?
SANBORN: Ten million ?
ELDRIDGE: Well I guess it makes sense . Anybody comes alongside the Humvee , we 're dead . Anybody looks at you funny , you 're dead . Pretty much , the bottom line , is if you 're in Iraq you 're dead . How 's a tank going to stop that ?
SANBORN: Gim me a break , Owen .
SMILING: Sorry . Just trying to scare the new guy .
JAMES: We had a few bombs up in Kabul too .
ELDRIDGE: Sure , I bet you did . But you 're going to be real busy here , boss . James smiles , settles back in the seat .
SANBORN: Hey Owen watch the fucking road .
ELDRIDGE: Imshee Imshee !
TO ELDRIDGE: Clear here .
ELDRIDGE: Clear here .
JAMES: ( looking around at the
EMPTY STREET: Where are the guys who called this in ?
OVER WALKIE: Blaster Mike , this is Victory Main . Negative . Figures to follow . Three- four-five-three is your grid . You should have a visual on them right now . They 're waving an American
OVER WALKIE: Blaster Mike . You should have a visual , waving a flag .
ELDRIDGE: They abandoned their vehicle ?
OVER WALKIE: Roger , Blaster . I copied you the first time . James approaches the empty Humvee .
JAMES: Hello boys
TO SOLDIERS: Do n't tell me the bomb is in there with you .
SERGEANT: ( pointing far down the
ROAD: Down on that block , one of ou informants says there is an IED in a white plastic bag .
JAMES: I 'll get it . Break out the suit . ( turning back to the
SERGEANT: Keep your guys back . Sanborn is already unloading the robot .
SANBORN: What about the bot ?
JAMES: Do n't need it .
SURPRISED: What ? Are n't we going to send the ot down to take a look ?
JAMES: Nah , I 'm going to take care of it .
SANBORN: I was thinking if we sent the bot down first James ignores him .
ELDRIDGE: He 's a rowdy boy .
SANBORN: He 's reckless .
ELDRIDGE: Somebody should tell the U.N. to send the rice in clear plastic bags so there 's no place to hide the IEDs . The insurgent would be like , ` Allah has forsaken me all the bags are clear ' .
SMILING: I 've seen so much garbage I 'm starting to like the smell .
OVER HEADSET: Creating a diversion .
TO ELDRIDGE: Get up on that wall .
OVER WALKIE: Copy that .

ELDRIDGE: I see his back . He 's walking downrange . Oh , I lost him .
SANBORN: Eldridge , move down that wall and maintain a visual . Move . Move . Eldridge teetering down the wall .
ELDRIDGE: Roger , roger . I 'm on him . He 's still walking . SOUND of BREATHING in Sanborn 's walkie .
HEADSET: Hell , I do n't know . I 'll let you know when I 'm standing over it .
ELDRIDGE: Car ! Car ! A car stopped in front of him .
HEADSET: Come back .
HEADSET: I got it .
OVER WALKIE: EOD has a nine on this Haji in the car . I 'm going to get two guys over there to back him up .
HESITATING: Stand down . EOD has the situation under control . Sweat on his forehead .
ELDRIDGE: We 're in a kill zone !
HEADSET: If he was n't an insurgent he sure as hell is now .
SANBORN: Copy that .
HEADSET: I 'll tell you later . James out .
HEADSET: We 're done .
HEADSET: Secondary !
TO ELDRIDGE: Off the wall , Owen !
TO SOLDIERS: Get behind something . Find cover .
IS REMOVED: Did you see that guy ? ( smiles , recovers his
MACHO: Man , I need a beer .
SANBORN: We can arrange that . He yanks at the strap - a little roughly .
JAMES: Colt .
SANBORN: Nice southern brand . Yanks at another strap .
ELDRIDGE: I 'd take a beer .
SMILING: Hey , that was n't too bad , for ou first time working together .
SANBORN: I think working together is I talk to you . And you talk to me .
JAMES: Are we going on a date , J.T . ?
SANBORN: No , we 're going on a mission . And it 's my job to keep you safe , so we can keep going on missions .
JAMES: Hey , this is combat .
ELDRIDGE: It 's just thirty nine days .
SANBORN: Thirty eight . Assuming we survive today .
ELDRIDGE: Tick-tock . Tick-tock .
JAMES: I do n't mean to mix it up . But the situation dictated it .
COOLLY: Roger that .
JAMES: I 'm serious . We 're gon na work together . You 'll get used to my ops tempo .
SANBORN: Your ops tempo ?
JAMES: I do n't always stop to chat , and I like to go fast . You know , so the insurgents do n't have time to plan . I do n't want them make any cell phone calls . Off Sanborn 's face .
SANBORN: Ketchup ? Eldridge passes his ketchup over to Sanborn .
ELDRIDGE: This is not Pizza Hut . ( removing a slice of
PEPPERONI: And this is not pepperoni . It 's ound and meaty , but it ai n't pepperoni .
SANBORN: Goat meat , probably .
ELDRIDGE: Goat meat pepperoni ? I 'd be glad if this was goat meat pepperoni .
SANBORN: Pray for something better and while you 're at it , pray for a new team leader .
ELDRIDGE: You sure you want to be the guy in the bomb suit ? They see James at a food station .
SANBORN: Be better than him . James approaches the table .
ELDRIDGE: Hey , James .
TO JAMES: That was some crazy shit you pulled out there .
JAMES: Yeah ?
ELDRIDGE: Hell yeah . You 're either really lucky or really good . Right up on the car like that . Gun to the head . Crazy . You know it might backfire on you someday . You know that . You might actually die . And then what ? James is puzzled .
JAMES: I do n't know , what ?
ELDRIDGE: You do n't meet your maker . You just get vaporized into little bits of
SANBORN: He asks everyone what they think about death . Ever since Thompson was KIA . James nods , turns to Eldridge
JAMES: I do n't think about it . Waste of time .
PELE: One for five , two for nine .
HAVING FUN: Three for twelve ?
PELE: Three for thirteen . And for you , no tax .
JAMES: Keep the change .
FIRST SERGEANT: The tags finally came . Figured you 'd want to be the one to take them over . ( handing Sanborn the
SANBORN: Thanks , I will handle it .
ELDRIDGE: `` Be all that you can be , '' right ? But what if all I can be is dead on the side of an Iraqi road ?
SANBORN: Hey .
JAMES: Hey . James starts to brush his teeth .
SANBORN: I got ta talk to you about something efore we roll out . James keeps brushing .
JAMES: Shoot .
SANBORN: Yesterday that was not cool .
JAMES: I know . We 'll get it . More tooth brushing . Face cleaning . James notices a tatoo on Sanborn 's forearm .
SANBORN: I was in Military Intel for seven years . Before EOD . We ran combat missions in every shit hole on the
PLANET: So I 'm pretty sure I can figure out a dumb trailer park redneck like you .
JAMES: ( spitting out water ,
SMILES BACK: Looks like you 're on the right track .
SERGEANT: An office worker called it in . The car does n't belong to anyone who works at the building . It 's been parked there for an hour . No license plate and the suspension is sagging , so there 's something heavy in the trunk three or fou hundred pounds . Could be a bomb .
JAMES: Did you evacuate ?
SERGEANT: We 're trying . But the English Ambassador said we 're supposed to guarantee his safety . Sanborn approaches , lap top in hand .
SANBORN: Bot is ready .
SOLDIER 1: Shit What do you want me to do ?
SOLDIER 2: Shoot her .
SOLDIER 1: We ca n't shoot her for riding a ike
JAMES: Eldridge - I want you in that window - keep the alley clear . Sanborn , cover it from the street .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: So in sixteen months time I elieve five million gallons pe day is in fact rather conservative .
EXECUTIVE: But security is still the big variable ? The Ambassador brushes his hand in dismissal .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Only on the margins .
SMILING: Everyday , the risks diminish and the rewards multiply Eldridge enters .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Ah , and here is EOD . You see gentlemen , everything is fine . The site is secure . The bomb if there even is one will easily be dispensed by the crack American team .
ELDRIDGE: Excuse me .
HEADSET: Stay put , I 'll be right back .
OVER WALKIE: What 's happening ?
HEADSET: We 're all in the kill zone on this one .
TO EXECUTIVE: Sir , I 'm going to need you to stay away from the window .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Yes , please , sit down . It 's safe .
EXECUTIVE: Why is he here , if it 's safe ?
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: He is just an observer .
TO ELDRIDGE: Is that true , we 're safe here ?
DISTRACTED: In my opinion , no .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: This is idiotic . Why not tow the vehicle away from the building ?
ELDRIDGE: I believe the lane is too narrow for a Humvee , Sir .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Donkeys . Use donkeys .
ELDRIDGE: I do n't believe we have any of those on hand , Sir .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Jesus , Lord . You Americans really are incompetent . No donkeys on hand ? What do you think I 'm talking about , a full squadron of farm animals ? Eldridge trying to stay on task .
ELDRIDGE: SIR
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Go downstairs , grab a farmer or one of those street vendors and procure - meaning purchase , buy - several donkeys . Then tow this car bom away from my office .
STEELING HIMSELF: Sir , I 'm going to need you to step away from the window .
HEADSET: Not in the back seat .
HEADSET: Not in the front seat . Doors . Dash .
HEADSET: None of the cord goes under . It 's up here somewhere .
HEADSET: Roger that . Be right out .
IN ARABIC: Where is the entrance to this uilding ?
SANBORN: Imshee ! Imshee ! The bicyclist looks at the car .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Oh , that 's rich . Give him a count .
TO HIMSELF: Please do n't make me kill you .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Been in combat very long ?
TO JAMES: James , you need to get out . There 's another potential bomber here .
TO SANBORN: So shoot him .
IN ARABIC: I need to make a delivery down there . Please let me through .
HEADSET: Gimmie a minute .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Well done . That took great self control .
ELDRIDGE: Thank you , sir . Again , I apologize for the intrusion into
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: Yes , but I doubt the insurgents will appreciate your restraint . If I may give you a piece of free advice , next time , pull the trigger .
ELDRIDGE: Well , actually , the uhrules
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: That 's the only way out , I 'm afraid . When you 're in a losing attle , you have to draw blood . No insurgency in modern history has ever been truly defeated , so all you can do is manage your exit . Clear a wide swath of bodies so you have room to withdraw .
AIDE: The building is empty , Sir , except for you .
AMBASSADOR GEDDES: I 'm sorry to say it , but that 's just how it 's done . You need to show some vigor . In Kenya , we executed the insurgents in thei eds , until they gave us room . Falklands , the same . That 's just how it 's done .
ELDRIDGE: Is that how you did it in Northern Ireland ? With murder ?
SMILING: There you are . Now you 're showing some vigor . And leaves .
NO ANSWER: James ? Still no answer .
HEADSET: Stay where you are , Sanborn . I 'm not done .
OVER TALKIE: I did n't copy that . Did you say negative ?
NERVOUSLY: James , what 's the situation ?
NO ANSWER: Goddamn , Will , I need a report .
SANBORN: Take the suit .
SANBORN: Hey , James .
JAMES: Yeah ?
SANBORN: Do n't you turn off your walkie again .
COLONEL REED: Hi boys . James turns around .
AWED: Hello , sir .
COLONEL REED: That you in the bomb suit ?
JAMES: Yes , sir , it was .
COLONEL REED: You were the guy in the flaming car , Sergeant James ? James is concerned .
JAMES: Yes , sir .
COLONEL REED: Well hot damn , that was some hot shit . You 're a wild man , you know that ?
JAMES: Thank you , sir . Slapping him on the back .
COLONEL REED: How many bombs have you disarmed , Sergeant ?
JAMES: Hell , I 'm not sure . A lot .
COLONEL REED: Sergeant , I asked you a question .
JAMES: One seven three . Counting today , Sir .
COLONEL REED: Holy shit . One hundred and seventy fucking three bombs . God damn . That must be a record . So tell me , what 's the best way to go about disarming one of these things ?
JAMES: The way you do n't die .
LAUGHING: Good one , spoken like a wild man .
LOOKING AROUND: I 'd like a picture with this man - anybody here have a camera ?
JAMES: Thanks , sir , thank you very much . Sir , could n't do it without my team Hey , Sanborn ! Get over here ! Sanborn trots over , glowering .
COLONEL REED: You guys should all get Bronze stars and I 'm gon na recommend it .
SANBORN: Thanks , Sir .
COLONEL REED: Good luck , boys . Keep on keeping on .
ELDRIDGE: Bronze star ?
SANBORN: I do n't care , the guy is not safe . You can have mine and I 'll pin it on your coffin .
ELDRIDGE: So you do think I 'm going to die .
SANBORN: Fuck , Owen . I do n't know . Probably not .
SHOUTING: Ball ! Ball !
PELE: Give it .
JAMES: Give me my five bucks and I 'll give you your ball .
PELE: Five dollars - for what ?
JAMES: Those DVDs were crap . They were so fuzzy I could n't see a thing .
PELE: No , impossible .
JAMES: I 'm telling you , they were fuzzy .
PELE: That 's Hollywood , my man . Special effects .
JAMES: What 's your name anyway ?
PELE: Pele .
JAMES: Oh yeah - like the soccer player ?
PELE: Yes , the great Pele
JAMES: Ready ? One , two
PELE: So you are EOD boomala boomala . It 's fun , no ?
JAMES: I like to disarm them . Tell you what , kid , I 'll buy another DVD from you but if this one is fuzzy you better watch out . Cause I 'm coming for you .
LEANING FORWARD: What if I should be pulling the trigger more often ? Killing people ? Bomb makers .
ELDRIDGE: But what if I need to change the mission - to survive ? That icyclist I told you about ? I 'm ninety percent sure he was an insurgent . I could have shot him . Not my mission . But it would have een legal .
SANBORN: Hey .
JAMES: Hey .
QUIETLY: If you ever get in my shoes and put on the bomb suit you 'll see you whole mind changes when you 're in front of a bomb . You lose 20 IQ points just from the weight of the suit . Your brain gets so much adrenaline that you hallucinate . Turn off the walkie ? Sanborn stares straight ahead .
JAMES: You 'll be lucky if all you do is turn off the walkie . Off the spinning dryer , we
ELDRIDGE: J.T . 's got some .
TO SANBORN: Water ?
SANBORN: No . I 'm all out . James just looks at him .
JAMES: Hold on a second . I think I forgot my gloves back there .
ELDRIDGE: Those detonators break all the time . Accidental misfire .
SANBORN: With that shot laid out like that , it could be a UXO that just cooks off .
ELDRIDGE: Boom .
SANBORN: Boom .
ELDRIDGE: A shot that size would obliterate everything in its path .
SANBORN: His helmet , you 'd have that .
ELDRIDGE: Oh yeah , there 'd be half a helmet somewhere .
SANBORN: And little bits of hair stuck to it .
ELDRIDGE: Little bits of hair .
SANBORN: We 'd have to recommend a majo change in techniques and protocols so that kind of accident neve happens again . You 'd write the first draft of the report .
ELDRIDGE: Are you serious ?
SANBORN: I 'm not going to write it .
ELDRIDGE: No , are you serious about killing him ? Sanborn looks up at Eldridge . Smiles . James starts driving back uprange .
OVER WALKIE: James ? Do you copy ? James ? He climbs to the top of the crater .
TO ELDRIDGE: Rock it out , slowly .
JAMES: Sanborn , watch that chain .
SANBORN: It 's alright . When
SHOUTING: What am I shooting at ?
SHOUTING BACK: I do n't fucking know ! but James is down ! ! !
TO SNIPER: Get up there with your Barret and help him out .
TO SERGEANT: I do n't see nothing out there . Chris is shooting wild .
SNIPER: Holy shit . He killed Chris .
JAMES: We should save our ammo at least until we can see these bastards .
TO SNIPER: Do you see anything .
SNIPER: It 's got to be coming from those uildings . Somebody moved on the oof of the tall one there .
SERGEANT: Hit him if you see him again . As suddenly The SNIPER is hit in the breastbone .
JAMES: Eldridge , I need ammo .
BINOCS: You 're shooting high .
TO SANBORN: Clear it , clear it . Eldridge clean the bullets . The blood is making them jam .
JAMES: Spit on ` em Eldridge . Spit . Rub . Spit rub .
ELDRIDGE: Roger . The soldier hands the ammo to James .
JAMES: Alright . Scan your sectors .
CALMLY: Still high , adjust your windage . Elevation .
SANBORN: Got it .
JAMES: He 's on the left by the smoke stack . Guy in white .
ELDRIDGE: Uh , Will .
JAMES: Yeah .
ELDRIDGE: At my one o'clock . Two hundred meters . Something moved behind a parked car . Either a tan dog or a man in a light-colored shirt .
JAMES: Deal with it .
ELDRIDGE: UhOk .
JAMES: It 's your call . Eldridge shifts his weight onto his rifle .
SOLDIER: Good hit , man . James and Sanborn do n't turn around . Eldridge slumps , spent .
SERGEANT: I do n't know .
SOLDIER: We 've been here two hours and they ai n't seen nothing . I 'm going to go for it .
EXCITED: Those fuckers are dead .
SERGEANT: What if they hit us with an RPG when we get out ? What if they were just waiting for us to get in the Humvee .
SOLDIER: It 's safe . I 'm telling you
TO SANBORN: You got those fuckers .
SOLDIER: See ? You got them . ( turning to building ,
SHOUTING: We got you mother fuckers . You 're fucking dead Hajis . Haha .
SOLDIER: Kiss this mother fucker ! ! !
JAMES: Ready ?

RECRUIT: Yes , Sir , Sergeant James Sir . You 're not very good drunk are you SIR ! ! You 're a good fighter , Sir . Natural born warrior , Sir .
ELDRIDGE: Really ? I got scared .
JAMES: Everyone is a coward at some point in their lives .
SANBORN: Hey Owen , look ! Will has possessions ! I did n't know you owned anything , Will .
JAMES: That 's my son . A real tough little astard . Like me .
SANBORN: So you 're married ?
JAMES: Well , she was my girlfriend , we had a baby , then she became my wife , then we got divorced . I thought we got divorced . But she 's still in the house , and she says we 're still together .

JAMES: She ai n't dumb . She 's loyal .
SANBORN: My problem is the one girl who I like keeps talking about kids . Kids . Kids .
TO SANBORN: Give her your sperm , stud .
SANBORN: Nah . I 'm not ready . ) And what 's this ?
JAMES: Bomb parts .
SANBORN: No shit . Why do you have them ?
JAMES: This is from the Blue Opal . It 's wild , is n't it , to hold something in your hands that could have killed you .
ELDRIDGE: What 's this one from ?
JAMES: That was one of our early roadside ombs we disarmed , the one with
SANBORN: it 's a piece of junk from Radio Shack .
JAMES: I agree .
TO ELDRIDGE: The only reason he likes you is ecause you act like his bitch , and you look up to him , and he likes to e the top dog .
JAMES: I agree with that too .
ELDRIDGE: Oh no , The humiliation is too great to ear . . Good-bye world . The gun clicks harmlessly . Eldridge laughs . A gust of wind rattles the front door .
SANBORN: That punch was harder than I hit you . I 'm owed a good one .
JAMES: Alright .
ELDRIDGE: Hold on , we need some rules . No face shots .
JAMES: Beauty mark , my mother dropped me at birth .
ELDRIDGE: Looks like frag scars .
JAMES: Ahhhh ! Excellent . Now your turn .
LAUGHING: Looks like it hurt .
JAMES: There there . It 'll be okay .
SANBORN: Get off of me you freak .
JAMES: Oh yeah , ride me , ride me .
ELDRIDGE: Later .
JAMES: Okay . Here we go big boy . And half carries Sanborn up the steps .
SANBORN: Do you think I have what it takes to get in the bomb suit ? James did n't expect this .
JAMES: Sure .
SLEEPILY: James , my God , what time is it ? Are you alright . Pause .
SLIGHTLY SLURRED: I 'm doing fine , babe . How are you ?

ELDRIDGE: Tough night .
JAMES: Hell , yeah . Eldridge nods . Wind picks up . The whole tent shakes .
ELDRIDGE: I fired him . I said , Doc , shooting a man had a salubrious effect on me .
JAMES: What the hell does that mean ?
ELDRIDGE: Healthy .
JAMES: You 're healthy ? Well , why not . They go back to eating . Sanborn joins James and Eldridge .
SANBORN: What 's up team ?
JAMES: I 'm going back to sleep now .
ELDRIDGE: Let 's roll .
TEAM LEADER: It was a car bomb . Fucking nasty one they had a decoy detonato set up so that when I disarmed it nothing happened then , I 'm walking back uprange to get some more tools and boooom ! ! ! If I had n't been wearing the suit , I 'd e dead right now .
ELDRIDGE: Get a Medic to look at your cheek .
TEAM LEADER: ( amazed at the sight of
HIS BLOOD: It 's no big deal . ) Be careful . They 're starting to hide the detonator really well .
FIRST SERGEANT: Sorry to ruin your day off , but your team is up .

JAMES: Guess no one 's home .
JAMES: The kid at camp .

SANBORN: You seen a body bomb before ? James shakes his head no .
JAMES: Do n't touch it . Let 's blow it .
OVER WALKIE: Blaster , we 've got a hold . I 'm not getting airspace clearance .
ELDRIDGE: So you really do n't think it was the DVD kid ?
SANBORN: No , I do n't .
ELDRIDGE: You 're positive ?
SANBORN: Yeah . Could it be ? One in a million chance .
ELDRIDGE: I do n't know . Will seemed positive . But that was weird .
SANBORN: Very weird .
FLAWLESS ENGLISH: Why do you talk to us like children . We are not children .
CAMBRIDGE: Gim me a break , will you ?
IRAQI MAN: Why should I ?
ELDRIDGE: But then Will 's pretty weird . He keeps bomb parts under his bed . Passing the water to Sanborn .
SANBORN: I bet you he does n't put this one under his bed . Sanborn laughs . James cracks the door , jumps inside .
JAMES: Our ride is here . Beat . Sanborn and Eldridge remain in a trance .
DVD MAN: Sorry . No English .
JAMES: No English ? Do n't lie to me . Where 's that kid ?
DVD MAN: Sorry , my man . Movie ? Five dollars .
JAMES: Are you guys responsible for this area ?
GUARD: What 's up ?
JAMES: That motherfucker over there could be an insurgent , watching the camp and giving intel to his buddies so they know where to launch their mortars .
GUARD: I think he 's just a guy selling DVDs .
JAMES: He 's a security risk . You should get rid of him .
GUARD: The merchants are cleared . I could n't do anything to him without the say-so from my CO .
JAMES: Does this change anything ? The DVD man looks stunned .
GUARD: Are you cleared to leave the camp through this gate , Sir ? James nods .
JAMES: Do n't fuck with me man , I 'm having a bad day already .
DVD MAN: Pele .
JAMES: Wait here . James gets out .

OVER WALKIE: We 're at the south gate , James . We 've been waiting for you for half an hour . Where have you been ? Over .
SANBORN: A tanker blew up near the Green Zone about an hour ago . We 're doing a post-blast on it . To figure out how the suicide bomber pulled it off . So where did you say you were again ?
JAMES: I did n't . Sergeant . Let 's go .
ELDRIDGE: What happened to your head .

FACE: He 's with me . Guns cover the face
COLONEL REED: Okay fellas ?
JAMES: Sorry , Sir . I did n't recognize you . Guns are lowered , fast .
COLONEL REED: We have n't found a body so it could e a suicide bomber or some cleve astard that caused all this and slipped away to sip tea with his mommie we just do n't know .
JAMES: We 'll take a close look , Sir .
COLONEL REED: This kind of situation we may neve know what happened . This is a mass casualty situation - terrible destruction .
JAMES: Roger that , Sir . We 'll do our best . A stretcher comes by .
COLONEL REED: They 're cowards , you know . I wish they would stand up and fight us , man to man , instead of playing hide and seek with me .
JAMES: Roger , Sir . We better get moving .
COLONEL REED: Right , go ahead Sergeant .
SANBORN: It 's hair .
CALLING: James ? !
JAMES: Hey , I 'm right here .
ELDRIDGE: You want to go out there ? James keeps looking into the distance .
JAMES: Yeah , let 's go hunting .
ELDRIDGE: I could stand to get in some trouble .
SANBORN: No .
JAMES: No ?
SANBORN: Man , this is bullshit . You got what ? three infantry platoons here . That 's their job .
FIERCELY: You do n't say No to me , Sergeant . I say No to you and I 'm not going to let this bomber slink off while the grunts get their act together .
JAMES: You got to work on your pull ups .
JAMES: That little bastard . Let 's torch this spot so he ca n't use it again .
SANBORN: No .
JAMES: Eldridge ! ! ! There 's no answer .
SANBORN: He 's gone .
JAMES: This guy comes out of the dark - Eldridge shoots .
SANBORN: Three shots , close range . He takes a step forward to see what he 's hit .
JAMES: Another guy comes from behind him gets the drop on him . You 're a hostage . They look up and down the wall .
SANBORN: That way is towards the tanker , troops .
JAMES: Hit ` em with both lights on three .
SANBORN: Fuck . Okay .
JAMES: One . Two .
ELDRIDGE: Am I dead ?
JAMES: No . You 're fine .
ELDRIDGE: Am I dead ? Am I dead ? Am I dead ? Off James ' face
SANBORN: So how you doing with this ?

SANBORN: Fine ? You know I lied to ou sergeant .
JAMES: Yeah . Thanks . I 'm just tired .
SANBORN: You want some sleeping pills ?
JAMES: Nah , I 'm good .
PELE: Hey , Boomala , Boomala ! James keeps walking . Eyes straight ahead .
SMILING: Look at these , best quality . No special effects !
JAMES: You 'll probably be walking in a few months .
ELDRIDGE: My tibia is shattered in nine places I do n't think I 'm going to e walking soon . The doc said six months if I 'm lucky .
JAMES: Wow . Six ai n't bad .
ELDRIDGE: Not bad ? It fucking sucks man .
ANGRILY: You see that motherfucker . That 's what happens when you shoot somebody .
JAMES: I 'm sorry .
ELDRIDGE: You 're sorry ? Fuck you , Will . Really fuck you . Thanks for saving my life and all ut we did n't have to go hunting for the trigger man . You invented it , to get your adrenaline fix . You war mongering fuck . James is stunned .
SANBORN: Take care of yourself , Owen .
JAMES: I hear ticking .
HEADSET: Hey , Sanborn .
OVER WALKIE: Copy . What 's up ?
OVER WALKIE: Send your skivvies down here on the ot , I 'll run a quick bleach cycle . Somebody threw out a perfectly good washing machine .
RELIEVED: Copy that .
JAMES: What 's going on ?
NERVOUS SOLDIER: We 've got a situation with a suicide bomber .
JAMES: We 'll follow you .
SERGEANT: Keep that translator back . One of the soldiers grabs the translator .
TRANSLATOR: But the bomb was forced on him . Against his will . He is not a bad man !
SERGEANT: He came walking up to ou checkpoint , said he had a bom strapped to him . He was sorry . He did n't want it to blow up . He egged us to take it off him .
TO JAMES: Help this man . He 's not a bad man .
SANBORN: Not a bad man ? You 've got to be kidding me .
TO JAMES: This is a trap . He wants to draw people close to him .
TO TRANSLATOR: Tell him to open his jacket . I need to see the bomb .
JAMES: With that much bang , I 'd need a hundred meter perimeter .
TO TRANSLATOR: Tell him to get on his knees . The translator SHOUTS . BLACK SUIT complies .
SERGEANT: Can we just shoot him ? As James considers that option when
TRANSLATOR: NO . He 's not a bad man . He has a family . The bomb was forced on him . He is asking for help . Only help .
TO TRANSLATOR: I want you one hundred meters away , like everybody else .
TRANSLATOR: But how will I hear ?
JAMES: You do n't need to . I 'm going down there .
TO TRANSLATOR: What the fuck is he shouting now ?
TRANSLATOR: He 's asking you to hurry . He thinks the bomb has a timer on it . James turns to Sanborn
JAMES: Where 's that helmet ? Sanborn pulls James aside .
SANBORN: We 've had our differences . Eldridge ? That 's water under the idge . It happened . But this this is suicide .
JAMES: That 's why it 's called a suicide omb .
SANBORN: It 's suicide for you , Will .
JAMES: Nah . That guy wants to catch an American ? I 'll give him an American .
JAMES: Uh-huh .
HEADSET: Sanborn , give your walkie to the translator .
OVER WALKIE: Yes ?
HEADSET: What the hell is this guy saying ? BLACK SUIT jabbers on in Arabic .
HEADSET: Hands have to stay behind his head or I will be very happy to shoot him .
OVER WALKIE: He says , please hurry he has a family .
TO TRANSLATOR: That 's not what I asked you . Now I 'm going to shoot if he does n't understand that he ca n't move his hands .
BLACK SUIT: Yes . Yes . Yes !
HEADSET: Sanborn , I need to get this rig off . There 's too many wires here to figure it out .
OVER HEADSET: Copy that , what do you need ?
HEADSET: Bolt cutters .
OVER WALKIE: Copy that . I 'll get ` em .
HEADSET: You 've got two minutes to get them and get down here .
TO MAN: Do n't move .
SANBORN: Holy shit . You were n't kidding .
JAMES: Nope . James works the cutter blade .
SOTTO: What is this made out of ?
BLACK SUIT: Please . Please .
SANBORN: Case hardened steel . James doubles his effort .
JAMES: Motherfucker . What 's our time ? Sanborn looks at the Casio .
SANBORN: Three minutes .
JAMES: Shit . Ok. Let me think . He puts the bolt cutter down on the ground .
SANBORN: I do n't think we have one of those in the truck . CU Casio Watch 2 30 .
JAMES: Let 's try the back of it .
SANBORN: We have to bail .
JAMES: Go . I got the suit . Sanborn looks at the guy .
SANBORN: What do you want me to do with the pistol ?
JAMES: Take it with you , that 's a good pistol .
SANBORN: When do you leave ?
JAMES: In forty five seconds . Sanborn turns , and begins running uprange .
SANBORN: Get back ! Get back ! The soldiers turn and run .
JAMES: I 'm sorry .
BLACK SUIT: Please , please .
JAMES: The metal is too thick .
BLACK SUIT: Help me . Help me !
JAMES: Sorry . CU Casio Watch 45 seconds .
SANBORN: No . I hate this place
JAMES: Have a hit .
SANBORN: I 'm not ready to die , man .
JAMES: Bro , you 're not going to die out here .
SANBORN: Another inch or two difference . Shrapnel goes zing . Severs my throat . I leed out in the sand .
BEAT: Fuck . If I die now , nobody will even really care . My folks , sure . But that do n't count . Who else ?
JAMES: You got time .
SANBORN: No I 'm done . I want a son , Will . I want a son .
JAMES: Hell , I do n't know .
SANBORN: But you know what I 'm talking about , right ? Every time we go out , you throw the dice . Live or die , you just throw ` em down . You ecognize that , right ?
JAMES: Yeah . I do . But I do n't know why . Do you know why I am the way I am ?
SANBORN: No , Will , I do n't . Silence . Then after a while
JAMES: This traffic is pissing me off .
SANBORN: Where are we , anyway ?
JAMES: I know where I am but I 'm lost .
YOUNG WOMAN: Honey , you grab the barbecue sauce and I 'll meet you in aisle four .
CONNIE: Let 's put the chicken on first and the vegetables on last , so they do n't burn ?
CONNIE CONT'D: Will ?
JAMES: Yeah , okay . You know , they 're really short on bomb techs over there .
CONNIE: Well , good thing the army is hiring , and they 've got so many great guys over there .
JAMES: Uh-huh .
CONNIE: Thanks for coming . Maybe he 'll listen to you .
SANBORN: I know how to talk to him .
JAMES: I know , it 's crazy . So how 's life at home treating you ?
SANBORN: I made the plunge . But I thought we were talking about you .
JAMES: We just did , buddy .
DOWN: Well , let 's see . I bet you do n't know the story of these magic oxes .
JAMES: Once upon a time , in a distant kingdom , there were many magic
JAMES: Every person had a magic box . But you could n't tell they were magic oxes on the outside . Like this one .
JAMES: With me , I think 's it 's one .
SANBORN: Get in , before I change my mind . They drive away .
SMILING: Could n't risk letting you on a public bus . Probably shoot the damn driver if it was n't moving fast enough .
STEWARDESS: Here you are , Sir Thank you for you service .
JAMES: Your welcome , m'am .
SOLDIER: Welcome to Delta-Company .
