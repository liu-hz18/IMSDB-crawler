BLONDE GIRL: Daniel , what 's wrong ? Did you eak your ankle ?
DANIEL: Number 3 is dead .
HENRI: Did anybody else see this ? OFF Daniel 's panicked nod
HENRI: Taillights in five minutes . What we ca n't carry
DANIEL: we burn . I know the drill .
HENRI: Time to go .
DANIEL: I did n't even get a chance to say goodbye .
HENRI: New IDs .
DANIEL: Just when I think you ca n't get any less original , you lower the bar .
HENRI: I 'm not interested in originality . I 'm interested in untraceable . There are 335,321 John Smiths in the United States .
JOHN: It 's been so long since the last scar .
HENRI: You got lulled into a false sense of security . That 's my fault . John struggles to keep his temper in check .
JOHN: I liked Florida . I liked having friends . I liked feeling normal .
HENRI: I wish that you could have a normal life but you ca n't .
JOHN: Then why fake it ? Why not just go hole up in the wilderness .
HENRI: That 's exactly what Number 3 did .
JOHN: Piken .
HENRI: The Mogadorians are natural-born hunters . Blending in is our best protection .
JOHN: So we just keep moving from town to town ?
HENRI: Until I say otherwise yes .
JOHN: I want to be from someplace , Henri .
HENRI: You are .
JOHN: Lorien 's your home , I do n't even emember it . John 's tone rubs Henri the wrong way .
HENRI: Like it or not , it 's your home too . You have a responsibility to those who died .
JOHN: I want a say in where we live . You already picked it , did n't you ?
HENRI: Cheer up , you 're going to be living in Paradise .
JOHN: She looks even perkier than the ealtor in Florida .
HENRI: What 's your name ?
JOHN: John Smith .
HENRI: Where are you from , John ?
JOHN: Arizona .
HENRI: Why did you move to Paradise ?
JOHN: Because you 're an asshole .
HENRI: This was a lot easier when you were
ANNIE: Here we are . Home sweet home .
HENRI: It 's perfect .
JOHN: That 's one word for it .
ANNIE: I feel your pain . I have a daughter his age . Apparently , I uin her life on a daily basis .
JOHN: This guy was covering a hole in my wall . Annie 's cheeks blush with annoyance .
ANNIE: I told the handyman to patch that efore you arrived . I 'm so sorry .
HENRI: Do n't you worry about it . She nods , grateful .
ANNIE: We 'll knock it off the rent . Keep the poster , Bernie Kosar brings good luck here in the Buckeye State .
JOHN: That 's the last of them . I 'm hitting the sack .
HENRI: I need a new photo first . John crosses and stands against the wall .
JOHN: Yeah , this place sucks .
HENRI: If there 's a story or picture of you on the internet , this program will find it . Our enemy does n't know who you are I want to keep it that way . John nods , knows he 's being a jerk .
JOHN: Sand Dollar Beach , that 's where we were jet skiing .
HENRI: I found our intruder he 's a little small for a Mogadorian . At that moment ,
JOHN: He 's starving , does n't have any collar or tags .
HENRI: Must have been dumped .
JOHN: You know , another pair of eyes and ears watching the house would n't be a bad thing .
HENRI: What are you going to call him ?
JOHN: Since I need all the luck I can get how about Bernie Kosar ?
HENRI: This one has five days of rations , spare clothes , cash and a handheld GPS . Keep it with you at all times .
JOHN: Henri , come on .
HENRI: Game 's changed . You 're in the crosshairs now . You have to be eady to leave at a moment 's notice . With or without me .
JOHN: Bernie , what the hell were you hiding in the car ? He scoops the dog into his arms .
TO BERNIE: Go home . Now .
SARAH: He 's really well-trained . How long have you had him ? John turns away .
JOHN: Sorry about your shot .
SARAH: No worries . He begins walking towards the entrance .
BEAT: I 'm Sarah . He nods .
SARAH: Where are you from ?
JOHN: Someplace warmer .
SARAH: I do n't think that qualifies as an actual answer .
JOHN: I need to register . She raises her camera to snap a shot of him .
SARAH: Capturing your first day , even though you 're technically six weeks late .
JOHN: Please do n't point that at me .
SARAH: Afraid the camera 's going to steal your soul ?
JOHN: What 's your problem ? I said no .
SARAH: It 's only for the yearbook . John regains his composure .
JOHN: I 'm not big into having my picture taken . Sorry .
SAM: His name 's Mark Jayne . Quarterback , sheriff 's son , he 's three years into the best fou years of his life .
JOHN: Did n't know I was on it .
SAM: You were talking to Sarah Harte .
JOHN: She was talking to me .
SAM: Mark and Sarah have been exclusive since Freshmen year .
JOHN: Maybe I 'll fire back next time .
SAM: Look , you 're new , so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater . Football players are gods the rest of us are mere mortals . If you want to survive , keep your head down and do n't make waves .
JOHN: You sound like my dad .
SAM: Obviously a wise man .
BEAT: I 'm Sam by the way . Sam extends his hand . John does n't take it .
JOHN: Thanks for the download . As he SLAMS his locker shut
COACH: Alright , people . Let 's hit the gym .
COACH: Enough ! Hit the showers .
TO JOHN: LeBron , grab a broom .
HENRI: Let 's keep this our little secret . OFF Bernie 's inquisitive eyes
SAM: First day here and you 're already destroying school property . So much for not making waves .
JOHN: It was an accident .
SAM: I hear the real spectator sport was Mark and Sarah 's blowout . John wipes his brow , distracted .
JOHN: Fine .
MARK: You got a problem ?
JOHN: Line starts back there .
MARK: Football players get priority .
JOHN: Where 's that posted ?
MARK: Unwritten rule .
JOHN: In that case , I guess I better ask you where I should sit . I was thinking about grabbing that chai next to your girlfriend .
MARK: You want to talk trash ? Let 's see you back it up .
MARK: Get up !
SAM: Dude , hold up !
JOHN: Henri , what 's happening to me ?
HENRI: Calm down . You 're going to be okay .
JOHN: On what planet is this okay ?
HENRI: Yours .
BEAT: I need to get you out of here .
JOHN: Okay , start talking . What the hell 's going on ?
HENRI: Your first Legacy is starting to manifest .
JOHN: Legacy ?
HENRI: An extraordinary ability . Yours is called Lumen . They start a lot sooner on Lorien . I was beginning to fear yours would never emerge .
JOHN: You knew this was going to happen ? Why did n't you say anything ?
HENRI: I did n't want to worry you . You were already under enough pressure .
SINCERE: I 'm sorry .
JOHN: What else have you been hiding from me ?
HENRI: This could n't be opened until you first Legacy appeared . Ready ?
JOHN: Whoa .
HENRI: Open it .
JOHN: What are they ?
HENRI: Crystals from Lorien 's core . They 'll guide us in your training .
JOHN: That 's what I am ?
HENRI: Like your parents and grandparents . John considers this new information .
JOHN: The other children in the ship Henri finishes John 's thought .
HENRI: They 're Garde as well . Once you 've mastered your Legacies , we 'll find them and face the Mogadorians together . John looks at Henri , curious .
JOHN: What Legacy do you have ?
HENRI: I do n't have any and never will . I 'm your Cepan a teacher . My job is not just to protect you but to train you .
BEAT: Give me your hand .
HENRI: Trust me .
JOHN: Ouch .
HENRI: When we 're done , your entire body will be shielded against fire . John rubs his singed wrist .
JOHN: Flying would be cool .
HENRI: You do n't get to pick them off a menu .
SARAH: How 'd you do it ? Her accusation startles him .
JOHN: Do what ?
SARAH: Eviscerate the entire senior class ?
JOHN: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
SARAH: So you were n't in the darkroom today ?
JOHN: No .
SARAH: Here 's a tip . If you 're going to lie , do n't leave a big red backpack at the scene of the crime .
JOHN: I do n't know what happened . Maybe it 's a sign that you should invest in a digital camera .
SARAH: Digital sucks . Film tells the truth . Clearly , I 'm not going to get that from you .
HENRI: Everything okay ?
JOHN: She was returning my backpack . He dumps it by the door .
HENRI: I think you should stay home from school for a couple of days .
JOHN: I 'm fine .
HENRI: Just to be safe .
JOHN: I 'm going for a run .
JOHN: Wanted to apologize .
SARAH: Does the apology come with an explanation ?
JOHN: John .
SARAH: Nice gloves .
JOHN: You know all these people ? She nods .
SARAH: Curse of a small town . I 've been around them my whole life . Kim Thomas . She peed in her bed at a sleepover when we were seven .
JOHN: Not very interesting .
SARAH: Determined to keep the mystery alive , are n't you ?
JOHN: You first .
SARAH: Okay . Recovering cheerleader . Wannabe vegetarian but I still love urgers . Dreams of being a photojournalist .
BEAT: I 've never actually admitted that last one to anybody before .
JOHN: Your secret 's safe with me . She studies him , sensing a kindred spirit .
SARAH: You ever feel you do n't belong in your own life ?
JOHN: Every single day .
SARAH: Wow . That almost sounded like a straight answer .
MARK: Coach wants me to rest my arm efore the scouts come . You did n't answer my question ?
SARAH: John was helping me move some oards . John turns to Sarah .
JOHN: I 'm going to take off .
MARK: Seriously , Sarah , what 's up with this guy ?
SARAH: I do n't have time for this , Mark .
MARK: But you had time to go to his house the other night . Sarah looks at him , stunned by the admission .
SARAH: You were following me ?
MARK: Just trying to figure out what 's going on with you . Sarah 's shock turns to anger .
SARAH: You 've crossed so many lines I ca n't even speak to you right now .
MARK: This is n't over . OFF John , unmoved by the threat
SAM: Nice freakout the other day .
JOHN: Was n't feeling well .
MARK: Told you it was n't over .
SAM: Assholes .
JOHN: That sensation you 're feeling emember it .
SAM: I raided lost and found .
JOHN: Who 's in the picture ? Sam stares at it , nostalgic .
SAM: My dad . My real dad . I took it the summer before he split .
DEADPAN: Sounds like a fun vacation .
SAM: I know . Insane . He called himself an anthropologist even though he only made it through one semeste of college .
SARAH: I heard about the lockers . I 'm sorry .
JOHN: I 'll live . He starts off again .
SARAH: I broke up with Mark . He stops , slowly turns back .
JOHN: Why are you telling me ? She bows her head , suddenly embarrassed .
SARAH: I do n't know .
JOHN: You made the right call .
SARAH: Halloween Block Party 's tonight .
JOHN: I saw the banners .
SARAH: I 'll be on Main Street hiding ehind my camera if you want to swing by . He says nothing .
HENRI: Was n't that your friend from the other night ?
JOHN: Her name 's Sarah .
ANNOYED: I did n't ask for a ride home .
HENRI: Principal called . Said there was an incident .
JOHN: A guy was messing with me . I took care of it . Problem solved .
HENRI: You 're stronger and faster because of Earth 's gravity you should n't use that advantage to settle petty scores .
JOHN: It was no big deal . Do n't blow it out of proportion .
HENRI: You ca n't risk everything ove wounded pride .
JOHN: I was n't looking for a fight . It just happened . Get off my back .
HENRI: Article says it was arson .
JOHN: We were clean . There 's no way the Mogs can track us here .
HENRI: They can track us anywhere . I think it 's time you saw what you 're eally up against .
GRANDFATHER: Keep moving .
GRANDFATHER: This is your Cepan . Go with him .
YOUNG JOHN: No !
HENRI: Your life is my life now . I will always protect you .
TO HENRI: He must survive .
GRANDFATHER: They are already hunting you ! Go !
YOUNG JOHN: Nooooooooooo ! THE MEMORY ENDS and we
JOHN: Nooooooooooo !
HENRI: A lot of Lorics sacrificed thei lives so that you could live .
JOHN: He said I must survive .
HENRI: The Elders had a plan . You were n't on that ship by chance . The nine of you were chosen for a reason . Even if only two of you live , together you 'll pose a grave threat to our enemy .
JOHN: You saw what they did to Lorien . How can nine or six or two of us take on that army ? It 's hopeless .
HENRI: I never thought we 'd get off Lorien alive but we did . I did n't know how we could survive on a strange planet but we have . I gave us six months before the Mogs found us it 's been 10 years . Do n't give up now . Henri grips John 's shoulders .
JOHN: How can you put so much faith in me ?
HENRI: Because your life is my life . If you quit , then everything I 've worked for and sacrificed is meaningless .
BEAT: Remember nothing is inevitable .
JOHN: It 's Sarah . The Block Party 's tonight . I 'll say I ca n't make it .
HENRI: No go .
JOHN: You work here ?
SAM: Not by choice . Ed 's my stepdad . He 's under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn , they 'll suddenly have the urge to uy sporting goods .
JOHN: What about your stepdad ?
SAM: He hit the tavern at 6 00 . He 's already hammered by now . I 'll probably find him passed out on the doorstep . Every night is trick â€˜ treat at my house .
SARAH: You made it . Like the T-shirt , Sam .
SAM: Guidance Counsellor said I need to set goals for myself . Figured I 'd aim high . She looks back at John .
SARAH: What do you think of Halloween in Paradise ?
JOHN: They should pull out all the stops next year .
SARAH: Well , you have n't had the full experience until you 've been on the Haunted Hayride .
SAM: I 'm impressed . Before John can respond , Sarah steps back .
SARAH: You guys ready ?
SAM: Three on a wagon might get a little crowded . I 'll meet you two on the other side .
SARAH: Sam 's cool .
JOHN: Definitely unique .
SARAH: I have n't really talked to him since 8th grade . Mark had a tight circle . If you were n't a jock o cheerleader , you did n't exist .
JOHN: I 'm glad you broke free .
SARAH: Me too . OFF their growing connection
JOHN: I 'm trembling on the inside . He smiles .
SARAH: You can smile . I was starting to have my doubts .
GRIM REAPER: Hell 's Gate , everybody off .
SARAH: Once we make it through , we 're home free .
SARAH: That was insane .
JOHN: What was that ?
SARAH: Just part of the ride .
JOHN: Are you sure ? As he steps forward ,
SARAH: Let go ! Stop it !
JOHN: Sarah ! Sa-
SARAH: Let go of me ! She futilely tries to wrestle free .
SAM: Sarah ?
JOHN: Where 's Sarah ? Tell me ! !
JOCK: Shepherd Falls . Now turn off that damn flashlight !
SARAH: Are you crazy ! Where 's John ? Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away .
MARK: Relax . It 's a practical joke .
SARAH: I swear if you hurt him
MARK: Why do you give a shit ?
SARAH: Get out of my face , Mark , you 're pathetic .
MARK: I 'm the best thing that eve happened to you and I 'm giving you one more chance . Appalled by his hubris , Sarah turns to leave .
SARAH: John ! Are you okay ? He nods . Mark looks past him , confused .
MARK: Where the hell are Kevin and Joe ?
JOHN: They got spooked .
MARK: Hey , those are police property !
SARAH: John ! Stop !
JOHN: I 'm not mad at you . I 'm mad at myself . She stops , faces him .
SARAH: I had no idea Mark would pull something like that . He has seriously gone off the deep end .
JOHN: The guy 's in love with you . Wants you back .
SARAH: That 's not love . Their eyes meet in the moonlight .
JOHN: For this ? Would n't waste thei time . She looks at him , curious .
SARAH: You 're not going to tell me how you took out those football players , are you ?
JOHN: You can . The air is charged .
SARAH: Good night . Sarah swings open the white picket gate .
JOHN: Wait .
JOHN: I better go .
HENRI: I heard on the police scanner that eight boys were beaten up in the woods tonight .
JOHN: They wo n't talk .
HENRI: That was a stupid thing to do . What were you thinking ?
JOHN: They attacked me . If I had n't defended myself , I 'd be in the ER ight now . Would that have been the better choice ?
STEPPING FORWARD: You 've got to start trusting me !
JOHN: I was getting to that . I got a new Legacy . Henri absorbs that revelation .
HENRI: Telekinesis . That 's a big step . Must have been triggered by the fight . John does n't correct him , averts his gaze .
JOHN: What is it ? Henri pulls up a website .
HENRI: We got a hit on one of the search words .
SCANNING: It 's a paranormal blog . â€œThey Walk Among Us ! â€�
JOHN: That 's Sand Dollar Beach .
HENRI: Looks like a cell phone camera . There 's enough for the Mogs to ID your face .
JOHN: Can you take it down ?
HENRI: Working on it .
JOHN: I 'm sorry , Henri .
HENRI: This is n't your fault . There 's still nothing to trace us here . Henri glances up from his screen .
SAM: I 've narrowed it down to three possibilities you 're a genetic experiment , you 're a freak of nature , or you 're an extraterrestrial .
JOHN: I do n't know what you think happened tonight
SAM: Your hands lit up like a firefly on crack , you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies , and you took off faste than an Olympic runner .
BEAT: Did I leave anything out ? John silently reels .
JOHN: What do you want from me ?
SAM: I just want to know who you are .
JOHN: I 'm a survivor from a planet called Lorien . Sam absorbs this confession with awe .
SAM: Your dad he 's from there too ?
JOHN: Henri 's not my dad . He 's my Guardian . If he found out you knew about us , we 'd be gone by morning .
PLEADING: I do n't want to leave Paradise .
SAM: I wo n't tell anyone . John nods , grateful .
JOHN: That does n't prove anything .
SAM: It proves he was n't crazy . I 'm starting to think that he did n't ail on us that maybe something else happened out there that he was taken .
JOHN: You going to be okay ?
SAM: If he finds you here , it 'll be worse .
BEAT: Go .
JOHN: You look wiped . Henri turns and smiles playfully .
HENRI: I was n't the only who was up last night .
JOHN: Sarah texted me . I went over to her house .
HENRI: I 've tried every trick I know , but I ca n't crack that blog 's firewall .
JOHN: There must be a way .
HENRI: We need to find where the site 's located and take it offline manually . The URL source has been un through a labyrinth of servers , it could take weeks to track down .
JOHN: I want to help . Henri takes a gulp of coffee and stands .
HENRI: You can . Get changed .
SARAH: I do n't see any family pictures around . I guess the photo aversion is hereditary .
JOHN: They died .
SARAH: I 'm sorry .
JOHN: It was a long time ago . It 's just me and my dad now .
SARAH: I get the feeling he does n't like me very much .
JOHN: It takes him a while to warm up to people . Sarah considers this .
SARAH: Thanksgiving 's tomorrow . Why do n't you bring your dad and celebrate with us ?
JOHN: I do n't know . Are there going to e a lot of people ?
SARAH: A tsunami of relatives . But do n't worry , I 'll shield you from the wave . Besides , I want everyone to meet you .
HENRI: I 've found the
JOHN: Just giving Bernie a quick bath .
HENRI: You 're clearly putting a lot of effort into it .
SARAH: I better hit the road .
TO JOHN: See you tomorrow . Twoish .
GRABBING BACKPACK: Bye , Mr. Smith . OFF John as she hustles out
HENRI: I finally tracked the location of that blog . It 's a house in Warsaw , Indiana . About four hours from here . I 'm heading up there tomorrow .
JOHN: Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving . I told her we 'd be there .
HENRI: Send my regrets .
JOHN: You should n't go alone . It could e dangerous .
HENRI: I wo n't risk taking you . I 'll leave early and be back by five .
JOHN: Do n't you ever get lonely ?
HENRI: How could I ? I have you .
JOHN: You know what I mean . All these years , there 's never been anyone .
HENRI: We are n't like humans . Once we fall in love , it 's for life . The pain of separation is unbearable .
JOHN: What was her name ? Henri slots a plate onto the draining board .
HENRI: Anastasia .
JOHN: You left her to save me .
HENRI: You 're not responsible for what happened to her they are .
BEAT: She ca n't come with us when we leave and we always have to leave , you know that .
HENRI: I was hoping to protect you from that pain .
JOHN: You ca n't protect me from everything . OFF Henri 's sad smile of acknowledgement
SARAH: Come on , we 're on gravy-boat duty .
JOHN: Just taking it all in . She crosses .
SARAH: I 'm glad you came .
ANNIE: Do n't mind me .
SARAH: Mom . No . John really does n't like having his
JOHN: It 's okay . Let her take it .
OVER PHONE: Are you one of them too ?
SARAH: I 'll see what 's taking him so long .
JOHN: It 's Henri . I have to go . Sorry .
SAM: Anything to get out of Thanksgiving at my house . He offers John a weary smile .
JOHN: Death scars .
SAM: They kind of look like the symbols in my dad 's research .
THINKING: You guys do n't
JOHN: Abduct people ? No . Irritated , he covers them back up .
SAM: How about the ones you said were hunting you ?
JOHN: They 're capable of anything .
URGENT: We need to get to Warsaw now .
JOHN: Number 417 . Henri tracked the URL to that house . Sam scans the street .
SAM: I do n't see his SUV anywhere .
JOHN: He would have parked it across town .
SAM: Stole it from Ed .
BEAT: Let 's move .
JOHN: I called you because I needed a ide , not a sidekick . If I could have run here , I would have .
BEAT: Go home . I 'll call you when I get ack . OFF Sam as John climbs out alone
JOHN: I told you to go !
SAM: They might know where my dad is !
JOHN: Henri 's here .
SAM: Wait ! Other than strength , speed and night-light , what powers have you got ?
JOHN: Telekinesis but that 's a work in progress .
SAM: No invisibility , X-ray vision , flight ?
JOHN: Sam , we drove here . Sam takes a deep breath , psyching himself up .
SAM: Okay . I 'm ready . Let 's do it .
JOHN: New plan follow Lucky Strike . Text me if he comes back . Sam sneaks off after Frank .
HENRI: You should n't be here .
JOHN: Your life is my life , remember ? Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze .
HENRI: I talked my way in . Thought the ig guy was buying it . He rubs a wound on his neck .
DISPIRITED: I 'm getting rusty .
JOHN: We have to leave !
FRANK: Stay planted or I 'll blow you friend 's head off . Henri looks at John in shock .
FREAKING OUT: You 're the one from the video ! You 're the one they 're after .
JOHN: Tell me what you know !
FRANK: I do n't know what they 're called . The one in the red coat said he 'd kill me if I did n't do what he wanted . This revelation stuns Henri .
HENRI: The Mogadorians they 've been here ? Frank nods in terror .
FRANK: He told me to call if anyone came asking about the video .
JOHN: Did you ?
HENRI: We need to go ! Now !
JOHN: Sam , get us out of here !
SAM: I must have dropped the keys ! Henri keeps his cool , looks at John .
HENRI: Start the engine .
JOHN: I ca n't . Henri 's calm eyes never leave him .
HENRI: Yes , you can .
SAM: Hurry up !
FRANK: I called you like I said . It 's not my fault they got away !
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER: Where did they go ?
FRANK: How should I know ? The kid had me pinned to the ceiling . The Commander turns to Bret .
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER: Where did they go ?
JOHN: We 'll meet you back at the house .
HENRI: We 're not going back to Paradise .
TO SAM: Thank you for your help , but you 'll never see us again .
SAM: Is he serious ? John nods , numb .
JOHN: Nothing . Forget about us . We never existed .
BEAT: Goodbye , Sam . OFF Sam as John climbs out
HENRI: We leave at nightfall .
JOHN: Henri , this is insane . They still do n't know where we live . Henri seethes .
HENRI: It 's only a matter of time . They know our faces . They saw Sam . How long has he known ?
JOHN: Since Halloween . Henri is floored and hurt by the admission .
HENRI: I trusted you and you lied to me ! John bows his head , ca n't meet Henri 's gaze .
JOHN: Only because I knew how you 'd react and I did n't want to leave Paradise . Henri paces , tries to quell his emotions .
HENRI: Now we do n't have a choice . The Mogs are using humans to trap us . From this point on no more towns . No more schools . We 're going off the grid until we find the others .
JOHN: No . His tone is defiant .
HENRI: This is n't a discussion .
JOHN: I 'm not leaving without saying goodbye to Sarah . Henri fixes him with a steel-edged stare .
HENRI: Let . Me . Down .
UNIFORM COP: The Chief wants to send the morgue oys in and seal this tomb .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Hope they have n't had lunch yet . These guys were gutted from the inside out .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Who the hell are you ?
SARAH: Where is he , Sam ?
SAM: I do n't know .
SARAH: What happened last night ? I 've tried calling him all day . But his number 's no longer in service .
SAM: Forget about him , Sarah . Incredulous , she grabs his arm .
SARAH: I 'm not going anywhere until you tell me what 's going on .
SAM: He left with Henri and he is n't coming back . Ever .
PULLING FREE: I 'm sorry . OFF Sarah , shattered
THROUGH DOOR: Taillights in five .
HENRI: John ? No answer . He KNOCKS . Still nothing .
ANNIE: Little late for dessert .
JOHN: I need to talk to Sarah .
ANNIE: She 's not here . Some friends dragged her to a party at Mark Jayne 's .
JOHN: She 's special to me too .
MARK: You were n't invited .
JOHN: Where 's Sarah ?
MARK: She does n't want to see you .
JOCK: Everybody upstairs ! Kevin 's going for the beer bong record !
A CANDLE: onto the white shag rug .
SARAH: John !
JOHN: I 'm sorry about last night . She pulls away , her relief turning to anger .
SARAH: No . Not good enough . Sam said you were never coming back . What are you doing here ?
JOHN: I could n't leave without seeing you one last time . She looks at him , crushed .
SARAH: So it 's true . What 's going on ? What kind of trouble are you and your dad in ?
JOHN: We 're going to be fine .
SARAH: Damnit ! Whatever it is , I 'll understand just tell me the truth .
JOHN: The truth is I 'm not who you think I am . You need to forget about me . Okay ?
SARAH: Why are you acting like this ?
JOHN: Because it 's the only way to keep you safe .
SARAH: Safe from what ? He turns away , shields her from his torment .
JOHN: Goodbye , Sarah .
TEENS: Drink ! Drink ! Drink !
JOHN: Call 911 ! As he races inside
EMILY: Went back for Dozer .
MARK: It 's too late . You ca n't get through ! John ignores him and runs into the inferno .
SARAH: John !
FRANTIC: Dozer 's under the bed . He 's too scared to come out !
JOHN: Do n't let go of him . I promise I wo n't let go of you .
SARAH: You walked through that fire without getting burned . I saw you stop that beam . SIRENS wail in the distance .
JOHN: I 'll explain everything but not here Sarah please ?
SARAH: I 'm sorry . I 'm still trying to process everything I saw and I keep coming to the same conclusion what you did is n't possible .
JOHN: It is for me .
SARAH: Who are you ? For once please tell me the truth . It 's the hardest thing he 's ever had to do .
JOHN: My name is n't John . I do n't have a name , just a number . 4 . In fact , my whole life can be reduced to numbers like 15 million that 's how many light years it takes to get from my planet to Earth . 38 that 's how many towns I 've lived in .

SAM: She 's gone . She 's at the Park Lane Mortuary . Two from the left . Under the ig tree .
RITA: Oh . I 'm sorry . The light is green !
SAM: Too many shrinksI 'm sorry Mrs. Dawson , if I were you I would n't waste any more time . I 'm sorry Mrs. Dawson it must be a tremendous disappointment . I 'm sorry Mrs. Dawson I think you 'd both e happier if Sam was in a home . Rita looks over at Sam , forced to stop .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Mr. Dawson , you do understand , that since I am a court appointed psychologist , the traditional client therapist confidentiality will be waived . Mr. Dawson , do you understand that the confidentiality will be waived ?
IFTY: Before you read your message press the ed button for record , when you finish , press the yellow button . If you press the green button , it will play it back you . Let 's start with the `` ogm '' .
SAM: Okay , okay . I 'm ready . Hello , I am Sam .
IFTY: No , no . I did n't press the red button .
SAM: Oh , yes . False start , false start .
IFTY: It 's not working . That 's what you get for buying a used machine . Used means oken . You 're asking for othe people 's problems , you have enough of your own , not that everyone does n't have problems .
BRAD: It 's not used . It 's pre-owned . Guy ought it for his auto shop and then he got a secretary .

PHONE RINGS: Hello Ted how you doing/ Whattaya mean what 's that supposed to mean ? Put Danny on You 're supposed to be taking him to karate . No it is not my day it 's your day .

I ca n't hear you I 'm in the car - they put you through to me hereI 'm losing you I get paid for this memory - I know I took him last .
SAM: He works in a bank .
RITA: Excellent .
IFTY: Sam is a very concerned father . He always saves his money at Bank of America . Last year there was a lion on the calendar . This year a gazelle . The gazelle is national bird of Tunisia . We have clients , not customers . At Bank of America . Bank on us . He looks up at her , lost . So is she .
BRAD: He always made a point of feeding he eakfast when `` Bewitched '' was on and lunch when `` Jeopardy '' was on so she 'd be smart . Is that Wonderbra you 're wearing ? Because you look wonderful .
RITA: How long have you and Sam -
ROBERT: Why are you recording this ? Who 's listening ?
RITA: It 's often necessary -
ROBERT: Who are you really ?
RITA: I 'm -
ROBERT: What 's that supposed to mean ?
RITA: Let 's -
ROBERT: I need to talk to my lawyer .
RITA: Patricia , get Mr. Dawson on the line .
SAM: Tall 's the smallest .
RITA: Of course . Of course , whatever . Okay okay okay . Damn ! I forgot to call back no I did and once you think of this person and there has to be one person - I want you to call me at work - because I 'm going back there now to my seven other cases What ? Mrs. Robeck ? I 'm on my way , the traffic 's horrible on the 405 . Dorothy , we put in five months lets not let a three car pile up..I know it 's been enormously stressful.. Your Esczema ? Oh , honey , nobody notices..AH ! They opened a lane !
SAM: Do you want it here or to go ?
RITA: Dorothy ? Dorothy ? No no no I did n't stare at the eczema for five months for -
SAM: Annie , it 's one day . One hour . Maybe only 53 minutes . Lucy needs you . You went to college . You can give the ight answers .
ANNIE: I ca n't . I 'd make it worse for you . I ca n't do it . Do n't you think I would if I could ?
THERAPIST: there is an unhealthy reversal of oles here . As you can see from her drawings , she has an exaggerated sense of esponsibility . Lucy feels she has to take care of her father . Although at her birthday party her true feelings about her father were revealed .
RITA: Objection . `` True feelings revealed '' ? !
TURNER: The state is paying Miss Geller for he opinions -
RITA: Then every child who rages because they did n't get to stay up for that extra hour of TV -
TURNER: Objection your honor - Sam TUGS at Rita 's sleeve . She ignores it .
RITA: in fact any child who said they hated their parents because they did n't want to take a bath would be a prime candidate for Foster Care .
TURNER: Objection .
SAM: I think they want you to stop .
RITA: Really ? ! Thank you , Sam .
JUDGE MCNEILY: We all appreciate your assistance Mr. Dawson - continue with your witness , Mr. Turner .
TURNER: Now Ms. Geller , I assume in your therapy session , Mr. Dawson extolled his parenting abilities .
THERAPIST: On the contrary , Mr. Dawson admitted he felt profoundly inadequate - that he was terrified he 'd made and would continue to make - and I quote `` Huge mistakes , huge mistakes , mistakes that are huge . ''
TURNER: No further questions .
RITA: You 're a mother , are n't you Ms. Geller ?
THERAPIST: Yes .
RITA: Would it be fair to say that as a parent , you 've felt confused from time to time , possibly overwhelmed on occasion , even though you 're a wonderful mother ?
TURNER: Objection . It 's Mr. Dawson 's parenting . Not Ms. Geller 's that 's at question here .
RITA: But if Ms. Geller has never had a moment where she felt confused as a mother it would bias her opinion . And it is he expert opinion we 're all after , is n't it , Mr. Turner ?
JUDGE MCNEILY: Overruled . I 'll allow it .
RITA: Thank you , your Honor . Ms. Geller , I know there have been many moments as a parent where I 've felt I 've made huge mistakes - mistakes that are huge . And I 've had to admit them to myself . My husband . But most importantly , to my therapist . Which is the guise Mr. Dawson thought he was seeing you under , is n't that right , Ms. Geller ?
TURNER: Objection .
JUDGE MCNEILY: Get to the point , Ms. Harrison .
RITA: The point is you 've never had those moments , have you Ms. Geller ? Moments that every parent I 've ever spoken to has - moments when you 've felt the task is so unbelievably challenging that you feel retarded , disabled in some way . Moments when you feel everyone has the key but you . But you 've never had those moments , have you Ms. Geller ?
THERAPIST: I -
RITA: Yes or no ?
THERAPIST: I -
RITA: Let me rephrase the question . When you son od'ed -
TURNER: Objection !
RITA: But if Ms. Geller did n't feel she had made mistakes - mistakes that were huge it might bias her opinion toward Mr. Dawson .
JUDGE MCNEILY: I will -
RITA: Thank you . So Ms. Geller - yes or no - when your son od'ed , did you feel you might have made mistakes , mistakes that were huge ?
THERAPIST: Yes .
SAM: You made her cry .
RITA: You got lucky .
SAM: That 's not nice . Not very nice .
RITA: Only in there .
SAM: Your secretary too . Yellow and green in one bowl . You separate the Lima beans from the corn please ?
RITA: Sam , do n't be impossible . Can I have the spinach omelet - only egg whites no fat no oil no butter and extra mushrooms .
CAFETERIA WORKER: Absolutely .
SAM: My treat . My treat .
RITA: Do n't be ridiculous . I 'll get it .
SAM: I said it 's my treat . That means I 'll get it .
RITA: Sam , do you really want to get it or are you just trying to
SAM: Trying to what ?
RITA: You know , trying to act like a -
SAM: Like a what ?
RITA: Like aa
SAM: A real man ?
RITA: I did n't say that .
SAM: You 're my lawyer and you think what they think . I do n't have a chance . No chance at all . Even with an expert witness .
RITA: I thinkyou deservea fair trial .
SAM: Answer the question .
RITA: Okay okay okay . What was the question again ?
SAM: Do you think what they think ? Sam ca n't order food . Sam ca n't pay a check . Sam ca n't take care of Lucy ?
RITA: It does n't matter what I think - it matters that we win .
SAM: You 're my lawyer it matters what you think .
RITA: Hey , it does n't matter to them what I think .
SAM: Me . It matters to me .
RITA: Dr. Donovan , the American Medical Journal named you one of the country 's leading oncologists . Is n't that correct ?
DR. DONOVAN: Yes .
RITA: What kept you going the twelve years you were in medical school ?
DR. DONOVAN: Caffeine . Sugar . And my mother 's confidence in me .
RITA: I wish I had a mother like that . She must have been smart .
DR. DONOVAN: She had great instincts .
RITA: Do you have any idea what her IQ was ?
DR. DONOVAN: In the lower ranges . About eighty .
RITA: So your mother , this woman with the IQ of a nine-year old had the wisdom to ecognize that you would be a great doctor . I guess her disability did n't seem to hold you back in life .
DR. DONOVAN: No . My mother 's condition taught me what they ca n't teach you ; compassion and patience .
RITA: Traits most doctors have in spades . Thank you , no further questions .
TURNER: How 'd you get through medical school ? Where 'd you live ?
DR. DONOVAN: We lived with my mother 's parents .
TURNER: Oh , Grandma and Grandpa . Would it be fair to say your grandparents were of normal intelligence ?
DR. DONOVAN: Yes .
TURNER: And did n't these people - you grandparents - with normal intelligence - have the real responsibilities ?
RITA: Objection ! I hear Mr. Turner 's mothe in-law lives with him ! She must help out . Does that mean he does n't have the eal -
TURNER: Motion to strike that from the record . Irrelevant , immaterial and immature -
RITA: Irrelevant ? ! Any parent has a right to a support system .
TURNER: I 'm not talking about the rights of the parent , I 'm talking about the rights of a child . I 'm talking about entrusting an eight year old 's welfare in the hands of someone whose records show he was diagnosed with infantile autism , mental etardation
RITA: Objection ! Motion to strike that from the record . It 's clear that one 's intellectual capacity has no bearing on their ability to love . You Honor , would you please instruct council to proceed with a modicum of sensitivity ?
TURNER: Oh , I 'm sensitive . I 'm real sensitive when I see people like you come here and try to give meaning to your life by screwing up somebody else 's !
JUDGE MCNEILY: That 's enough . Both lawyers approach the bench !
RITA: And I suppose tearing apart a family is truly noble work , Mr. Turner .
JUDGE MCNEILY: That 's it . I fine you both fo contempt . Two-hundred fifty dollars .
TURNER: What 's that to her ? She gets that fo picking up the phone .
RITA: Oh , that 's what this is about .
TURNER: I 'll tell you what this is about . See this is an award for you at some luncheon . But I 'm here everyday . You win , you 're out the door . But guess who I see come back ? The kid . Most of the time , in less than a year . Only now it 's too late . So you 're ight . I 'm real sensitive . You ca n't even touch that area .
LUCY: But how did he prove it ?
SAM: Columbus had to sail around the world to prove it was round .
LUCY: You 're so smart , Daddy .
MARGARET BROWN: Excuse me , time 's up .
LUCY: Please . Just a little more .
MARGARET BROWN: I have another client at two-thirty . You need to put your shoes on and get eady to go .
LUCY: Oh no ! There 's a knot . A really big knot .
MARGARET BROWN: I 'll help you . She undoes it quickly . Hands it back .
LUCY: I need to go to the bathroom .
SAM: What 's going on ? What made her change her mind ?
LUCY: I started crying in the bathroom . She thought we needed more time .
SAM: That was so nice of her . Very nice .
LUCY: Let 's not get off . Let 's keep going .
SAM: No , Lucy .
LUCY: Please .
SAM: That would be wrong .
LUCY: Tamara 's Mommy lost her case and Tamara has n't seen her in six years . She 's had five different mommies and one of them hit her .
SAM: I wo n't let that happen .
LUCY: That 's what her real mommy said . And now they wo n't even let her talk to her .
SAM: I love you Lucy . I love you .
LUCY: My name is n't Lucy anymore , it 's Michelle .
COP: Hey , buddy . No loitering . Move it .
SAM: Not yet not yet not yet .
COP: You want me to get a black and white down here ?
SAM: Not yet not yet not yet .
COP: Jesus Christ .
SAM: She has n't been sleeping well . She needs a good night 's rest . Let he sleep , let her sleep .
COP: What are you , crazy ?
RITA: What were you thinking what were you possibly thinking ? !
SAM: I -
RITA: That 's ridiculous ! Danny stay with me - What could you possibly gain by kidnapping your kid in the middle of a custody hearing ? !
SAM: She -
RITA: I do n't wan na hear it ! Can you possibly explain this to me ? !
SAM: But Lucy said -
RITA: Who 's the parent here ? Who 's the goddamned parent here ? Danny ! Stay in the hallway -
MARGARET BROWN: I 'm -
RITA: But I ask you what parent in their right mind seeing their child in pain
MARGARET BROWN: I have seen -
RITA: Their yearning for contact - would n't take them in an attempt to comfort them ? Where the hell is Danny ?
MARGARET BROWN: You -
RITA: He -
MARGARET BROWN: There 's -
RITA: Oh yes there is ! And if I were you I 'd look at my conscience you do have one do n't you long and hard before I tried to use this in court .
MARGARET BROWN: Is that a threat ?
RITA: No . It 's a plea . Give 'm a break . Give 'm one goddman break .
MARGARET BROWN: What ? ! No , Mrs. Sloan . His temperature could n't be 117 , no not even 107 . Okay , okay , I 'll comeCome on Lucy , I 'll take you back .
RITA: C'mon , Danny . We 're going home . Danny ! ? Danny ! ? ! ? The FIRE ALARM GOES OFF and
LUCY: Please do n't fire us . It was all my idea . Please do n't . Please . Please .
BAILIFF: the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God ?
LUCY: So help me God
TURNER: I heard you turned seven this year . That 's pretty exciting .
LUCY: Everybody gets older . It 's not that big a deal .
TURNER: What 'd you get for your birthday ?
LUCY: I have n't opened my presents yet .
TURNER: Really ? That 's odd . Why not ? Lucy looks to her father and Rita .
LUCY: I opened my presents . I got the HELP album - limited edition .
TURNER: Oh , I 'm sorry . I was confused . I thought you did n't open your birthday presents because you ran away from you own party when your best friend told everyone that you were adopted .
LUCY: I never said that ; why would I say that ?
TURNER: Why would your friends say it if you had n't said it ?
LUCY: Kids lie all the time .
TURNER: May I remind you Lucy that you 're unde oath ?
LUCY: You may .
TURNER: And do you know that means if you lie you could be in serious trouble ?
LUCY: I do .
TURNER: So now that you and I have agreed to tell the truth , where did you sleep last night ? Rita glares at Margaret . Thanks a lot .
LUCY: In my bed at the Foster home .
TURNER: All right , Lucy . If you 're not going to tell the truth , I am . Your dad kidnapped you last night and the police found you sleeping in a seedy park a hundred miles from here . You 're lying ight now because you 're afraid . Afraid that everyone will see how scared and frustrated you really are . You 're afraid of hurting him , but now we need to tell the truth . The truth is deep inside you know you 're not getting what you need from your father . Is n't that ight , Lucy ?
LUCY: `` All you need is love . ''
SAM: No , Lucy , you lied .
LUCY: Shhh ! Do n't tell anyone .
MARGARET BROWN: Lucy , Mrs. Kerry 's here to take you ack .
LUCY: I thought you 'd be proud of me . Jo Jo 's mom told him to lie on the stand and say he never saw a needle in the house ; and he did , and now they 're back together .
SAM: Jo Jo is n't us . The truth , the truth , when the judge hears the truth , he 'll know , he 'll know we should be together .
LUCY: Nobody 's interested in the truth , Daddy . Nobody cares !
GEORGE: Sam 's my most reliable employee . He 's never missed a day of work in eight years . Always warm , always friendly .
TURNER: Admirable qualities for a single father . Mr. Walker , in these eight years , have Mr. Dawson 's responsibilities , whichlet me seewould include ussing tables , replenishing Sweet ' n Lows , and sweeping up the place increased ?
GEORGE: No . Not really .
TURNER: And is n't that because he 's mentally incapable of learning management skills or working the cash register or even making a cup of coffee ?
RITA: Objection . Leading the witness .
JUDGE MCNEILY: You may answer the question . George searches for a way to tell the truth .
GEORGE: Well as a matter of fact , Sam and I have een discussing a promotion that I was planning on putting into effect at the end of the week . Sam leaps to his feet .
SAM: Oh boy ! Thank you , George !
TURNER: Yes . Thank you , George . Now , afte eight years , Sam can finally measure out a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water . Now , he must certainly be able to help Lucy with her geometry .
RITA: Objection -
TURNER: No further questions .
RITA: and when I ask another question ?
IFTY: I answer in one sentence .
RITA: Yes . Short and sweet .
IFTY: Yes . One sentence . Short and sweet . My aunt was short and sweet . But he cooking was too spicy she
SAM: Annie ! I ca n't believe it !
ANNIE: Tell them to take me quickly .
RITA: Give me one minute with the judge .
ANNIE: Yes .
RITA: Lucy 's very lucky . Did n't you graduate Magna Cum Laud from the Julliard School of Music ?
ANNIE: Summa Cum Laud .
RITA: Excuse me . Now Ms. Cassell , in all the time you 've known them , have you eve questioned Sam 's ability as a father ?
ANNIE: Never .
RITA: Never ?
ANNIE: Never . Look at Lucy . She 's strong , she 's able to display true empathy fo people , all kinds of people . I know you all think she 's as bright as she is despite him . But it 's because of him .
TURNER: Can Sam add ?
ANNIE: Yes .
TURNER: How about multiplication ?
ANNIE: He 's learning .
TURNER: So what you 're saying is that Sam can not even multiply two times two ?
ANNIE: I do n't know about you , Mr. Turner , but my fondest memories of my parents have nothing to do with times tables or state capitals .
TURNER: I bet he 's knocking on your door all the time with questions .
ANNIE: Yes . All the time . The last question was whether to use Biz or Clorox to get the grass stains out of Lucy 's socce uniform .
TURNER: So let 's see..he does n't know mathhe ca n't even wash her clothes . How about puberty ? I can only imagine how much insight he 'll bring to approaching the sensitive issues of a young girl 's development .
ANNIE: Mr. Turner , show me a father , any father , who knows how to do that and I 'll give them the Parent of the Yea award .
TURNER: And you 've had plenty of opportunity to observe fathers , have n't you ?
RITA: Objection !
TURNER: But the fact that Ms. Cassell has n't come out of her room in years might have some effect on her perception .
JUDGE MCNEILY: I 'll allow it .
ANNIE: I had twenty eight years in the world to observe all kinds of fathers .
TURNER: What about your father , Ms. Cassell ? Since you appear to be an expert on father-daughter relationships .
SAM: Objection ! No further questions !
TURNER: Excuse me , Mr. Dawson ?
SAM: I said that 's enough ! I will not allow it ! Overruled ! Overruled ! !
RITA: Thank you again , Annie . You were truly extraordinary .
SAM: Extraordinary . Truly extraordinary . Annie does n't move .
RITA: Okay okay okay okay . Well , Sam has his ig day on the stand tomorrow and we need to work a little bit so that he 's as effective as you were .
SAM: Effective . Very effective .
RITA: On a Porsche , the , uh , the door handle is a little hidden by that thingamajig , so if you 're having a hard time finding it I 'll just
ANNIE: Noooooooo !
SAM: Annie 's not quite ready to go outside yet .
RITA: Okay , we 'll just take our time .
ANNIE: I 'm ready now .
RITA: Good , fine , Sam ? Annie 's ready . Sam 's fallen asleep .
DANNY: Guess .
RITA: I do n't want to guess . Where is he ? I told you I do n't want to guess .
DANNY: Well where was he last night ?
RITA: Working late .
DANNY: There you guessed it .
RITA: He said he was working late ?
DANNY: That 's what he said .
RITA: Well who did he say was taking care of you ?
DANNY: You . But you said you were working late .
RITA: I am working late .
DANNY: Then go work .
RITA: How was your day ?
DANNY: You have to work . Go work .
RITA: No . How was your -
SAM: This is my favorite part . Hey Dommy , this one looks like he 's suffering from shell shock .
DANNY: Boy I guess we can shell it out It was a shell of a good hit .
SAM: `` Turtles in the half-shell , turtle power ! '' Rita ! Come this is the best part . He heads towards Rita .
RITA: It 's getting late . We have to get to work . This is my husband 's . He wo n't notice . He 's got ten more just like it . Try it on .
SAM: Bad ?
RITA: No . Very , very good . But your tie 's crooked .
SAM: Let me see let me see let me see .
RITA: Sam ! I told you you have to stop that ! It makes you look stupid ! Okay okay okay . Try again . You say you will find her a tutor . Then I say , `` How will you pay for it ? ''
SAM: Could you slow down ? Why do you eat so fast ?
RITA: We 've gone over this a million times . You 've found a free tutoring service fo her at the YMCA .
SAM: But I did n't . You did .
RITA: Ca n't you grasp the concept of manipulating the truth ? Not lying . Just a little tweak here and there .
SAM: NoYou 're so lucky . You get to play with Danny all the time .
RITA: He does n't want to play with me .
SAM: Yes he does . He does he does . He thinks you do n't want to .
RITA: Oh that 's ridiculous of course I want to .
SAM: Tweak , tweak .
RITA: I drove around after work yesterday 'til 9 30 looking for a goddman razo scooter !
SAM: Tweak , squeak , peek peek
RITA: Okay , why did you harass that young boy at your home ?
SAM: You know I did n't harass him , Rita . You know that , you know that !
RITA: Sam , I 'm pretending to be Mr. Turner , emember ? Okay ?
SAM: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . I did n't harass him , Mr. Turner . Mr. Turner - You do n't look like him .
RITA: That 's a blessing .
SAM: You 're so much prettier .
RITA: Thank you . Now . What makes you think you can take care of a woman - I mean a young child - when you have a hard time taking care of yourself ?
SAM: In some ways . But in other ways , she 's not , I think .
RITA: You think ?
SAM: I think .
RITA: Sam . You 've got to be firm on this .
SAM: I think in other ways I 'm smarter than her . Smarter than you are , Mr. Turner . In fact , in some ways I 'm smarter than you , Judge McNeilly .
RITA: Whoa ! Bring it down .
SAM: What parent does n't want more for thei child ? To be more than the sum of the parts of the whole of them .
RITA: Yeah yeah yeah , but it 's one thing for a little girl to love her daddy when she 's a baby , but once she loses respect fo you , what will you do ?
SAM: I wo n't let that happen . I wo n't .
RITA: How can you say that ?
SAM: Respect is not just about how smart someone is . Smart is not just about how smart someone is .
RITA: But what about Lucy ? Are n't you being selfish ? Does n't she deserve a bette life ? Do n't you think she 's just pretending she 's happy to not hurt you feelings ?
SAM: Lucy is happy ! We have fun ! We go to Denny 's , we go to video night . I know how to love her . I know I 'm not going to able to go to law school and learn how to be a mean person , but I know how to love . I know how to be her father , Mr. Turner !
RITA: I know you do , Sam . I know you do .
GEORGE: You look great , Sam . What time do you have to be in court ?
SAM: Half day , half day . I take the stand at two .
GEORGE: Okay , we need two grande cappucinos , non fat .
SAM: Sprinkles or Cinnamon ?
GUY: What is this ? I ordered an Americano , not a latte .
SAM: Americano , Americano , not a latte .
GEORGE: I 'll call a taxi .
SAM: No , no , I ca n't wait . I ca n't wait . I 've got to go right now .
TURNER: Your Honor , if the defendant does n't have enough interest in his daughter to even show up -
RITA: Your Honor , I 'm sure he 'll be here any moment . This is an extremely important day to Mr. Dawson .
JUDGE MCNEILY: Make it brief , Ms. Harrison .
RITA: What the hell happened ? What is that smell ? Mint ?
SAM: Lucy needs me .
RITA: Yes , slow down because Lucy needs you .
SAM: Lucy needs you .
JUDGE MCNEILY: Ms. Harrison . We need you !
RITA: How will you be able to pay for private tutoring ?
SAM: There 's a free program at the YMCA . Lucy can go there .
RITA: But do n't you ever think it would be etter for Lucy if she lived with a permanent foster family and you could visit whenever you wanted ?
SAM: The Fosters do n't know her . Why ca n't she live with me and they can come visit if they want to . I 'm firm on this . And I 'm getting firmer . Lucy belongs with me .
RITA: Why ?
SAM: Paul wrote the first part of the song `` Michelle '' . He said to John , `` Where do I go from here ? '' John had been listening to Nina Simone . There was a line in it that went something like , `` I love you , I love you , I love you '' They put that into the song . It would n't be the same song without that . It made the song complete . That 's why the whole world cried when they broke up on April 10 , 1970 .
JUDGE MCNEILY: Did you get that , Mary ?
TURNER: When you were Lucy 's age , were you living at home ?
SAM: No .
TURNER: Were you living with your mother and father ?
SAM: No .
TURNER: Well then where were you living ?
SAM: In an institution .
TURNER: So your parents put you in an institution ?
SAM: Only after my mom got sick .
TURNER: What about your father ? Where was he ?
SAM: Gone with the wind when Sam was born .
TURNER: So , you were n't raised by your mother ?
SAM: I saw her I saw her .
TURNER: When ?
SAM: Christmas , Easter and my birthday .
TURNER: Oh , once a year on your birthday . So in a way , the people at the institution were your parents . Were they nice to you ?
SAM: Some yes . Some on . Some yes .
TURNER: Did they hit you ?
SAM: Sometimes . Sometimes they did sometimes .
TURNER: Like when you hit Lucy 's friend at he irthday party ?
RITA: Objection ! Nobody hit anybody !
TURNER: Let me rephrase that , strong-armed . So what role model do you call upon as a father when you 're parenting Lucy ? The head of the institution ? The Principal the warden ?
SAM: No . Not Mr. Whitehead . Not him .
TURNER: Then who ?
SAM: Myself .
TURNER: you have the mental capacity of a seven year old . So you ask yourself , a seven year old -
SAM: I am not a seven-year old .
TURNER: How to parent a fellow seven-year old ?
SAM: Yes . No . What was the question ?
TURNER: The question is what makes you think you can be a parent ? Your background ? Your IQ ? Your friends who ca n't even testify for you ?
RITA: Objection -
SAM: My friends -
RITA: Objection -
SAM: My friends love Lucy even if Rita thought they were n't smart enough to testify . Even if she said you 'd wipe the floor with them .
TURNER: Excuse me , Mr. Dawson , your lawyer just objected ; that means you did n't have to answer the question . You ca n't even follow the simple rules you 've watched here day after day . You really think you can raise a seven-year old ? A ten year old ? A thirteen-year old ? That means she 'll be six years more advanced than you .
SAM: I 've had a lot of time to think about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent . It has to do with constancy . It has to do with patience . It has to do with listening . To pretending to listen when you ca n't even listen anymore .
IFTY: Irreparable .
TURNER: Right , `` Kramer vs . Kramer . '' Thank you for the commentary , Mr. Bhutto . It 's hard to find words is n't it , Mr. Dawson . It 's confusing . It 's confusing to know what to say to Lucy half the time , is n't it ?
SAM: No , yes , no .
TURNER: No what ?
SAM: Let me see let me see let me see .
TURNER: You do n't know what ?
SAM: Yes .
TURNER: Yes . You 're right , you do n't know . You do n't know enough to really raise you daughter ?
RITA: Objection . These are n't questions , these are attacks .
SAM: I am Lucy 's father .
TURNER: Are you ? Are you really ? I 'm not talking about the fact that you got some homeless woman pregnant .
RITA: Objection your Honor . I motion a ecess .
JUDGE MCNEILY: Denied . Get to the question , Mr. Turner .
TURNER: The question is if you love you daughter as much as they say you do do n't you think she deserves more ? ! Do n't you ? In your heart of hearts , secretly question yourself every day ? Do n't you ? !
SAM: Yes .
TURNER: Was that a `` yes ? ''
RITA: Objection .
SAM: Yes . She does . She deserves everything . In my heart of hearts .
TURNER: Yes she does . And you agree with everyone , you ca n't give her that ?
SAM: Maybe . Maybe everybody 's right .
MARGARET BROWN: C'mon , Lucy . It 's time to say goodbye .
LUCY: NOOOO ! Do n't let go do n't let go do n't let go -
MARGARET BROWN: Please help me .
RANDY: Your teacher told me you were an artist .
LUCY: You wear too much perfume . You 're trying too hard .
RANDY: I am , are n't I . Maybe you could teach me how to paint .
LUCY: My daddy 's coming today . We 're going to open my birthday presents . Why do n't you just go do something .
MAN: Excuse me , my kid knocked over a coffee , could you clean this up ?
SAM: You need a towel ? A refill ? A glass of water ? You need more than you already have ? You have everything - Everything . But it 's not enough . Take my daughter , too !
LUCY: You gave him the wrong address ! You 're hiding me from him !
RANDY: No .
LUCY: What 's the longest any one of those kids stayed with you ?
RANDY: Megan stayed a little over a year .
LUCY: Did you ever want any of them to stay longer ?
RITA: I do n't have time for this ! You were supposed to show up for your first evaluation . And I leave work early to get there and where the hell are you ? ! Open the door ! Sam ! Open the goddamn door ! Alright . If you do n't care enough to open the goddamn door I 'm outta here ! I 've ruined my practice , I 've alienated my colleagues - I sent my kid off on a fishing trip with his father so I could work with you and you wo n't open you goddman door for me ? ! Fine ! THAT 'S IT ! I 've had enough !
SAM: No room . No room .
RITA: Hey . I lived in the East Village . I do n't need a lot of room .
SAM: Sam makes life too hard . Sam makes life too hard on everyone .
RITA: Sam , I can go at least nine more rounds . But you got ta let me in . Please Sam . Please .
SAM: I do n't want to work there anymore . Too many people .
RITA: Maybe we could find you a quieter job . Because remember one of the judges conditions is you have to earn more money ; you 've got to keep earning more money for when we get you Lucy back .
SAM: Lucy does n't need me anymore . She has a new family . She does n't need me anymore .
RITA: Is that what she said ?
SAM: She did n't have to say it . I may be stupid , but I know . I know .
RITA: Well that 's the first stupid thing I 've ever heard you say .
SAM: I tried . I tried .
RITA: Try harder .
SAM: You do n't know . You do n't know .
RITA: I do n't know ?
SAM: You do n't know what it is to try and try and never get there . You were born perfect , perfect .
RITA: Is that right ? Everyone else is perfect ut only Sam feels loss and pain ?
SAM: That 's right . People like you do n't know .
RITA: People like me ?
SAM: People like you do n't know , do n't know what hurt feels like , people like you do n't feel , do n't feel anything .
RITA: You think you got the market cornered on human suffering ? Well let me tell you something about `` People like me . '' People like me feel little and lost and ugly and dispensable . People like me have perfect husbands screwing someone far more perfect than me and my son , my son hates me , I try too hard and I push and he knows it and I talk in that voice , that voice I promised I 'd neve use , and I 've screamed , I 've screamed horrible things to him , a five year-old ecause he does n't want to get in the car at the end of a day and he stares at me with such anger and I hate him then . I know I 'm failing you , I know I 'm disappointing you , I know you deserve etter but get in the fucking car ! It 's like every morning I wake up and fail , and I look around and anybody , anybody can pull it off , but somehow I ca n't . And I know , I know I have everything , and I 'm still miserable and it 's pathetic . I know it 's pathetic . No matter how hard I try , something about me will never be enough .
SAM: You 're enough . You 're so much more than enough .
RANDY: You 're early .
SAM: All the lights were green .
RANDY: There 's a reason for the court schedule . You stopped showing up . Lucy has had to ebuild her life .
SAM: I want her back . I can do it . I know I can .
RANDY: That 's not up to me , but I 'm telling you , I will do everything in my power to prevent Lucy from getting hurt again . Sam hangs his head . A dog barks at Randy .
SAM: Supplemental income supplemental income - athe , walk and feed . Sam Dawson meets your canine needs . Sit ! Sit ! Sit ! Sit ! Sit ! Sit !
LUCY: You never came ! You never even called ! You forgot about me ! How could you forget me !
SAM: I never forgot you . I forgot me .
SAM: Napa cabbage , excellent choice . Purple and green , purple and green . Very rich in Vitamin C. Good choice . Very good choice .
RITA: Hello , Sam . Mr. Dawson . Sam . Dawson .
SAM: Hello , lawyer .
RITA: Shall we ?
SAM: No . We already did . Do n't tell anybody .
RITA: Furthermore , my client has found a new job , and is making every effort to find a bigger apartment so that -
SAM: Here .
RITA: Oh , thank you . What aa lovely arrette , Mr. Dawson . It will look great on Lucy . Who I 'm sure you bought it for . Furthermore , so thatthere will be more room for Lucy as she grows up .
MARGARET BROWN: All of that is well and good but the fact that Mr. Dawson quite his job , missed his hearing , and did not even show up for his visits with his daughter
RITA: The fact that my client went through profound depression is the most natural eaction any parent could have .
MARGARET BROWN: But once again he had no idea how his ehavior during that depression impacted on his daughter .
RITA: In these next months , Mr. Dawson will be expanding his support system to include Social Service programs , tutors
MARGARET BROWN: It 's too late ! The foster family is petitioning the court for sole custody of Lucy and I fully support thei equest . Sam turns to Rita . This ca n't be happening .
IFTY: Is n't it illegal ? It 's illegal to go through stop signs . It 's illegal to cross on the red .
RITA: It 's not illegal . It 's very complicated . When a strong foste parent lobbies for a child it changes the equation .
ROBERT: They 're reaching right through Sam as if he does n't exist . As if he 's a ghost .
RITA: There 's one option we 've never talked about , Sam . I know what you went through the last time you took the stand . We could settle out of court , ask for the most incredible visitation rights - it would almost seem like joint custody .
SAM: You 're saying I do n't have a chance . That 's what you 're saying .
RITA: I 'm not saying you do n't have a chance .
ROBERT: That 's what you said last time and look where he is now .
SAM: Stop . Rita 's not saying I do n't have a chance . Are you ? Tell me I have a chance . Too long a pause . Ifty looks at the clock .
IFTY: Oh my God ! 6 35 is Video Night at my house and I 'm not even there !
ROBERT: If we get there before you do we 'll wait for you - check !
BRAD: Sam get your dessert to go .
SAM: This is very hard to say . I 'm having my dessert here . With Rita . I 'm not coming to video night .
RITA: Sam - if you want to go
SAM: I said no , Rita .
RITA: I know , but if you -
SAM: What ? Do you want me to go ?
RITA: I did n't say that . But do you want to go ?
SAM: Where ?
RITA: Nevermind .
SAM: Fine .
RITA: Fine .
SAM: I 've got it . Long pause . Rita slowly eats her pie .
RITA: Yes we do .
SAM: I need to get Lucy back . We need , we need - to be professional .
RITA: Do you know what that means ?
SAM: When dealing with Starbucks ' customers , e friendly but not familiar . I can be your friend .
RITA: Thank you , Sam .
SAM: You need to leave your husband .
RITA: Oh , my marriage is n't so bad .
SAM: 'Life is very short and there 's no time for fussing and fighting , my friend . '
RITA: It 's justit 's just thatI 've neve lost anything .
LUCY: We 've made $ 22.36 . That 's seven dollars , 64 cents less than thirty .
RANDY: Well that 's one way of looking at it .
LUCY: Daddy ? !
RANDY: What are you doing here ?
SAM: I live here . This is where I live .
LUCY: This is where you live ? So close to me ?
SAM: I wanted to be close to you . I wanted to be closer . Look at my apartment number . John was born on October 9th . His son was born on October 9th .
LUCY: John met Yoko on November 9th .
SAM: His mother lived at 9 Newcastle , Liverpool .
LUCY: Newcastle . 9 letters . Liverpool - 9 letters
RANDY: Lucy , give me one minute with you father . Sam , I consider myself an understanding person but I do n't understand this . You ca n't close the distance between you and Lucy with a new address . We go to court in a week -
SAM: I do n't want to spend half my visit with Lucy on the bus getting to Lucy . I do n't want to waste one more minute . Buster sneezes .
LUCY: Does Buster still have his cold ?
SAM: He 's better , much better . Now I 'll have one box of mint chocolate cookies .
LUCY: That 'll be three-eighty six .
SAM: Lucy Lucy . What are you doing ? ! You could have really hurt yourself . What are you doing ?
LUCY: I could n't sleep . Daddy , did you know that Warren G. Harding was the twenty ninth President of the United States ?
SAM: No .
LUCY: Remember - the twenty-ninth President . In case the Judge asks .
SAM: She could n't sleep .
RANDY: Give me my daugh - Give me - I 'll take Lucy .
SAM: Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three times , tell her two stories and give he half a Denny 's blueberry muffin and a third of a glass of milk she 'll sleep . Good night .
RANDY: Lucy . Come here .
LUCY: Thank you . Goodnight .
RANDY: Goodnight , Lucy .
RITA: My husband left this when he moved out .
SAM: Oh , lovely Rita , meter maid .
RITA: Nice place . I worry . I worry sometimes
SAM: You worry you did the wrong thing ?
RITA: I worry that I 've gotten more out of this relationship than you .
SAM: No no no . I 'm the lucky one . I have the lawyer that never loses .
RITA: That 's meokay , let me see , let me see , let me see . They 're going to put Bill and Randy on the stand first and then you .
SAM: Them first , then me . They 're a nice couple . They have a nice house . She 's pretty . She 's smart , too . I can tell . The manager of the salad bar is gon na testify , is n't he ? That will help us .
RITA: Absolutely .
SAM: Nobody believed that George Harrison could really be a song writer . But he wrote `` Here Comes the Sun '' . John and Paul said it was one of the best songs on ABBEY ROAD .
RITA: George was always my favorite Beatle .
SAM: Lucy 's was Paul .
LUCY: Now .
RANDY: What honey ?
LUCY: Now . I want to see him now .
RANDY: She fell asleep on the car ride over . I was gon na turn back and tuck her in to her bedwith the pink canopyand the quilt I madeBut I was afraid she 'd wake up at our house and want to come home . Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion .
SAM: I hope I hope I hope that you 're saying what I think you 're saying even though you 're not saying it .
RANDY: Goodnight . I 'll see you in court . Save me a seaton your side .
SAM: Randy ! If I tell you I ca n't do it alone , will you tell the judge ?
RANDY: No .
SAM: Promise ?
RANDY: Promise
SAM: I 've looked and looked for a mother fo Lucy . Help , I need someone , help , not just anyone . You 're the red in Lucy 's painting .
SAM: Penalty ! Rules broken . Penalty , please !
OBNOXIOUS MOM: Get her ! Phillip , you get her !
ROBERT: I saw that ! You gave him a secret signal ! Did n't you ?
IFTY: Keep both eyes on the ball , Lucy - balls are round - on sale at Kmart . The earth is a ball , too
SAM: Penalty ! Repeat ! Rules broken ! Penalty !
SAM: Play ball ! Play ball !

STEVEN'S MOM: It 's true .
STEVEN'S DAD: Your Mother 's right . It 's cause we love you . So we put some money in a brown paper bag and gave it to your real mom in the hospital parking lot so you could come home with us . Okay ?

DEBBIE: Oh that . Yeah , um , well I do n't know-
STEVEN: I swear honey- getting around the system 's so easy . No one would even know I did it .
DEBBIE: I know you want to find her Steven , but you need to think about this .

STEVEN: Are you Barbra Bascombe ?
MRS. BASCOMBE: Yes . Is something wrong ? Is someone hurt ?

MRS. BASCOMBE: I do n't think I know what you 're talking about .
STEVEN: Elizabeth City ? St Jude 's Hospital ? Remember ?
MRS. BASCOMBE: I do n't know what you 're talking about .

DEBBIE: He likes to keep little secrets sometimes .
KEMPLE: Like the fact that he was a big queer ?
DEBBIE: Yeah , like that .
KEMPLE: But suicide , my god .
DEBBIE: Well he does tend to overreact .
KEMPLE: I feel like I do n't even know him .
DEBBIE: Well Jimmy , that 's the thing . I 'm not eally sure he knows who he is . He 's searching , at least that 's how I figure it . I 'm just not sure he knows what it is he 's looking for .
KEMPLE: Can you tell me exactly what he did ?
COP: He has several warrants out in Texas . Fraud , forgery , embezzlement
DEBBIE: What ?
KEMPLE: I should have known I should have said something .
DEBBIE: Do n't blame yourself Jimmy I did the same thing . There were always signs . I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest .
KEMPLE: That would be a warning sign
DEBBIE: And all that Peter Allen music on his Walkman .
KEMPLE: Denial is a powerful thing . I do n't feel so bad now .
DEBBIE: I just never thought . But now stealing ?
KEMPLE: He 's probably been doing it for years . I say to myself he did it just to buy me things but I do n't think that 's true .
DEBBIE: It 's bigger than that . I 'm sure .
KEMPLE: But why then ?
DEBBIE: And why suicide ? I mean- just like that ?
KEMPLE: I know- he seemed so happy and
DEBBIE: Steven ! ! !
KEMPLE: Steven ! ! ! Stop !
STEVEN: Hi . Welcome to prison . I 'm Steven . Arnie is scared . Terrified . Speechless .
STEVEN: You 're gon na catch a beating any day now , that 's just the way it is . I lost three teeth and cracked a vertebrae . Anyway , all you need to do is fight back . Win o lose , just fight back . Or you could try to suck the guys ' dick . Your choice . He moves on .

STEVEN: I guess I 'm inclined to believe you .
PHILLIP: Why 's that ?
STEVEN: I met you today , did n't I ? Phillip smiles .
PHILLIP: Ohhhhh , she sounds so sweet
STEVEN: Oh she 's an angel . I think I 'll be sure to write her back and tell her I 'm not lonely anymore that I made a good friend .
PHILLIP: Why 'd I have to meet you today ?
STEVEN: Something wrong ?
PHILLIP: It 's just- I 'm being transferred to Michael Unit today .
STEVEN: What ?
PHILLIP: I 'm sorry .
STEVEN: Do n't be sorry . It 's just across the yard .
PHILLIP: Well I do n't go into that yard so it might as well be Oklahoma . Just figures with my luck . I was born Friday the 13th
STEVEN: It 's not gon na change a thing , Phillip . In fact , Friday the 13th 's my lucky day . Do n't worry , this right here . This is destiny .
PHILLIP: But we only just met .
STEVEN: Listen , I 've loved a lot . And I 've been around , so I recognize the feeling .
PHILLIP: Do n't you think you 're coming on a little strong ?
STEVEN: I know you 're trying to protect yourself , I get that . It 's fine . Give me a chance to prove you wrong . Phillip is melting but tries to hide it .
PHILLIP: I 'm sure I do n't know what you 're talking about .
STEVEN: Good
PHILLIP: Yes .
CLEAVON: I ai n't no motherfucking DHL , faggot . Besides I ai n't got nothing for you anyway
PHILLIP: But it 's been three days .

STEVEN: I know a guy . I took care of it . I 'm gon na take care of everything
PHILLIP: Enough romance , let 's fuck .
STEVEN: Really ? What 's a Broadway producer doing in Atlanta ?
PHILLIP: I did n't ask .
STEVEN: What 'd you do for him ?
PHILLIP: I mainly just rode around town in his limo , drinking and sucking him off .
STEVEN: Apache ? What was his name ?
PHILLIP: Melvin .
STEVEN: Phillip- you amaze me .
PHILLIP: What ? He was a nice guy too .
STEVEN: That 's what I 'm saying- you only see the good .

STEVEN: You poor thing . How awful
LARGE PRISONER: I 'm gon na cut out your motherfucking tongue with your screeching all night .

PHILLIP: Steven-

GUARD: Shut up and move .
PHILLIP: Steven !
YARD GUARD: You do ?
PHILLIP: I WAN NA GO IN THE YARD !
YARD GUARD: Hold your horses Dorothy .

STEVEN: What the hell are you doing ! ?
PHILLIP: I love you !
STEVEN: I love you too ! VROOM ! The bus starts up and begins to move .
STEVEN: Hi , how are you ?
TAXI DRIVER: I 'm well . Where you headed ? The Greyhound ?
STEVEN: Nearest thrift store please .
TAXI DRIVER: Sure . You mind if I tell you the word of our Lord , Jesus Christ ?
STEVEN: Hi there , my name 's Steven Rousseau . I 'm an attorney . My client is Phillip Morris . I called earlier . The guard checks his roster .
DUTY OFFICER: Mmm hmmm . There you are . Rousseau Phillip Morris . Like the cigarette huh ?
STEVEN: I beg your pardon ?
PHILLIP: You said you 'd come right away , but Jesus !
STEVEN: I got work to do honey , I 'm getting you out of here early . I got a hearing tomorrow morning , I got motions to file . The law do n't sleep baby .
PHILLIP: I love you so much .
STEVEN: Phillip , you are the sweetest , most gentle man I have ever met . And I know people have taken advantage of that . But I do n't ever want you ever to lose that innocence . I want to build a life with you Phillip . I want to protect you . They share a smile .
PHILLIP: Get me out of here .
STEVEN: The motion was filed , I presented to the DA and got a letter from the judge- I do not understand what the hold up is . I 'm not some paralegal- I am Steven fucking Rousseau and I expect prope adjudication !
HOUSEWIFE: How nice
STEVEN: You want mayo with that ?
RELEASE OFFICER: Yep- Morris- we got him right here waiting .
STEVEN: I 'm his lawyer .
PHILLIP: You 're incredible .
STEVEN: I know .
BAYLOR: Phillllip ! It 's so good to see you Another friend enters .
BLAKE: Oh my God ! You look great . Prison agreed with you . How do I get on that diet ?
PHILLIP: Oh you could n't handle it- not unless we smuggled an espresso machine in a cake .
BLAKE: Throw in a Sicilian Barista and I 'm there !
PHILLIP: This is Steven . Steven- Blake and Baylor .
BLAKE: This is him ? ! This is your gay lawyer prison boyfriend ? ! Pleased to meet you .
BAYLOR: Much better than the guy who had you kidnapped . What was his name ? Steven looks to Phillip , perplexed .
PHILLIP: Long story .
STEVEN: Can I get you all a drink ?
PHILLIP: Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor- Eudora Mixon . She is just the sweetest .
EUDORA: Pleasure Steven .
STEVEN: Eudora
PHILLIP: Eudora owns a little building in Montrose and she 's having a hell of time with the uilder . He sounds like a real asshole .
EUDORA: His plans were useless and he 's trying to sue me to pay him ! I need your expertise Steven . Phillip says maybe you can help .
STEVEN: I could certainly try .
EUDORA: Can you still practice law , having been to prison ?
STEVEN: Sure- why not ?
EUDORA: I just thought- Oh what do I know ? I 'd just be glad to have someone I could trust . I 'll pay your normal fee . Steven does n't miss a beat . He smiles wide .
STEVEN: It would be my pleasure . Litigation is my speciality .
JUDGE: I know . It 's your turn .
STEVEN: Oh Your Honor , Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product . She is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that Mr. Evans signed .
LAWYER: The terms of that contract were ambiguous at best . The truth is , defendant engaged my client for three years without full payment .
STEVEN: Your honor I have , in my briefcase , fourteen other contracts , all on public ecord , in which Mr. Evans entered into litigation with past clients of his !
LAWYER: Is this true ?
EVANS: No .
LAWYER: You 're making me look like an idiot . He regroups and addresses the judge .
JUDGE: He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have to say ?
STEVEN: I demand to be seen in chambers ! !
JUDGE: Okaaaaaaaay
LAWYER: This seems to be cut and dried here , sir . I do n't even know why we 're back here . Mister Russell is treating this like an episode of Matlock .
STEVEN: I 'll admit your honor- I 'm a plain spoken man . I did n't go to Princeton . I did n't go to Yale . My education was modest . I went to a small school . I grew up on a small farm . But I passed the same ba exam as my colleague here and I am not going to let him push around this humble woman . This scores with the judge .
JUDGE: Point taken Mister Russell He glares at the other lawyer with scorn .
STEVEN: I think it 's obvious where I 'm going with this sir .
JUDGE: Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao ?
LAWYER: Shit Seeing this , Steven puffs with confidence .
STEVEN: Your honor , that 's exactly what I 'm talking about .
EUDORA: Yes . You did very well , Steven . Thank you .
STEVEN: I mean , I did great ! Really great ! I 'm so proud of myself ! You want half my sandwich ? !
EUDORA: Um
STEVEN: No ! We 're going out ! I 'm paying ! !
PHILLIP: Oh my God , it 's amazing .
STEVEN: I thought you 'd like it honey .
PHILLIP: Can we afford this ?
STEVEN: You let me worry about the money sweetheart .
PHILLIP: Okay , well I guess I better start packing oxes .
STEVEN: Not this weekend .
PHILLIP: Why not ?
STEVEN: I think we both need a vacation . Key West ? Phillip smiles .
PHILLIP: How 'd you know he 'd do that ?
STEVEN: I did n't . I just knew I wanted ` em fo you and I found a way to do it . That 's all .
PHILLIP: Just listenin ' huh ?
STEVEN: That 's it
LINDHOLM: Yep . Never got out there though . NASA 's a real political place . Never could figure out whose ass to kiss to get a mission . All in the past . Barely even think about it now
STEVEN: A spaceman , huh ? How do you crap up there ?
LINDHOLM: Ass gasket . Have a seat . Steven sits across the desk from Lindholm .
STEVEN: I could not speak more highly of Steven Russell , Mr. Lindholm . A real straight shooter . We were damn lucky to have him at Prudential as long as we did . In his own world , Phillip chimes in .
PHILLIP: Brando 's wet debut ? Steven covers the phone with his hand .
STEVEN: On the Waterfront .
LINDHOLM: Employee of the year two years running ? Developing software with IBM ? You 're the kind of people we need here Steven . We want you as our Chief Financial Officer . So what do you say ? I want your answe ight now . C'mon Steven- let 's light this candle . As Steven pretends to mull
RHEBA: for example `` he 's in a meeting '' sounds etter than `` he 's away from his desk '' at least I think so , but whatever you prefer .
STEVEN: That 's fine sure .
RHEBA: I pulled all the claims for the last two years as well as the statements , transfers and confirmations from the ank . Most of it 's routine and I think you can get up to speed in a day or two . Anything else I can do for you ?
STEVEN: Uh . cup of coffee ?
RHEBA: I 'll do it today but I do n't do that eally .
MARK: Crossover from traditional markets shows declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net-trade trending . HMO penetration still leads PPO , NMO and FMO as usual but attenuation is growing more prevalent in Q4 as projected As fo Q3 , well Q3 is what Q3 always is Q2 with training wheels .
BIRKHEIM: Okay Steven , your turn . I know you 've only had the one quarter to play catch up ut I tell you , we ca n't wait to get some insight here .
STEVEN: Sure . What about ?
BIRKHEIM: Mark 's projections .
STEVEN: Mmm hm . Sure .
BIRKHEIM: They seem kind of flat .
STEVEN: Oh . Okay . Ummm
PHILLIP: The tux ? Where are you going ?
STEVEN: It 's just a work thing . Were we supposed to
PHILLIP: No- I just thought- it 's fine . Where you going ?
STEVEN: Some stupid gala ball thing
PHILLIP: Gala ? Oh Sounds boring .
STEVEN: Yeah . I 'll be home early . Promise .
LINDHOLM: You see that ?
STEVEN: No Oh- is it ?
LINDHOLM: Yeah . Probably deploying the arm right now . Just a satellite deployment . Nothing special Just touching the face of God .
MRS. LINDHOLM: Oh I heard about you .
STEVEN: Good things I hope .
MRS. LINDHOLM: Yes and no . Don 's bellyaching about how ig your Christmas bonus is gon na be ecause you 're making him so much money .
FACELIFT WIFE: Are you married Steven ?
STEVEN: Uh engaged .
BLONDE WIFE: Well where is she , sweetheart ?
STEVEN: She works . Travels a lot . It 's killing her she could n't be here . And as the wives fret symathetically-
VERA: Thanks Steven . You doin ' good ?
STEVEN: Kind of . I just got back from my lawyer 's office . I asked him , `` What 's your fee ? '' He says , `` I charge $ 50 for three questions . '' So I ask , `` Do n't you think that 's a little expensive ? '' And he says , `` Yes it is Now what 's your final question ? '' Vera EXPLODES with laughter .
VERA: It 's so true . Lawyers ! She turns to a colleague .
BIRKHEIM: That 's the thing about the back nine at Pebble Beach .
LINDHOLM: I could n't agree with you more . I emember one time , I was at Augusta
SECRETARY: The woman says , '' That 's awful expensive , is n't it ? '' and the lawyer says , `` Yes and now you only got one question left ! ''
LINDHOLM: Mushroom and cheese . Anyway like I was saying the Northrup guy says to the NASA `` well that question 's gon na cost fifty million to answer '' so NASA says , `` Do n't you think that 's a lot of money ? '' and Northrup says `` Yep , now you owe us another fifty million . Next question please ! ''
STEVEN: Yeah that 's a good one
LINDHOLM: That 's why there 's so few shuttle missions . They 're wasting all thei money on bureaucracy . And probes Unmanned probes . Like people care if there 's life on Mars . No mushrooms , I said .
PHILLIP: Golf ! ?
STEVEN: What ?
PHILLIP: You 're a homosexual .
STEVEN: It 's work .
PHILLIP: You know , you can tell them . They ca n't fire you for being gay .
STEVEN: I know
PHILLIP: I 'm trying to be understanding here honey , but golf ? Why not just eat pussy ?
STEVEN: Wish me luck .
PHILLIP: Good luck !
STEVEN: Oh ! This is easy ! Your turn Dan !
LINDHOLM: Hell of a hazard ai n't it Steven ? Eventually , a ball flies out of the trap .
CLIENT: So the black fella says to the jew lawyer- `` 50 bucks a question ? Ai n't that expensive ? '' `` Yeah it 's expensive , '' he says , `` I 'm a Jew , you nigger ! '' The man laughs to himself .
RHEBA: Anything else I can do for you ?
STEVEN: Uh . cup of coffee ?
RHEBA: I 'll do it today but I do n't do that eally .
STEVEN: So I ask , `` Do n't you think that 's a little expensive ? '' and the lawyer says , `` Yes it is , now what 's your final question ? '' Vera EXPLODES with laughter .
VERA: It 's so true . Lawyers ! She turns to a colleague .
LINDHOLM: Steven , we got a problem . Vera lost that stupid rubber stamp again . Her office is a goddamned disaster and she 's the o-ring if you know what I 'm saying .
STEVEN: Oh how long till we can get a new one ?
LINDHOLM: Nope . Time to overhaul the program . I got a computerized system already on order . No more room for pilot error . Steven hangs his head , visibly disappointed .
STEVEN: Really ? ! Great !
LINDHOLM: You play golf ?
STEVEN: Uhhh yeah . Sure .
PHILLIP: How big was this Christmas bonus ?
STEVEN: Pretty big .
PHILLIP: In July ? Phillip is slightly suspicious .
STEVEN: No .
PHILLIP: I swear . It 's in the Ricky Martin People in the bathroom . Steven smiles and cuddles up .
STEVEN: Mmm hmm
PHILLIP: They can find out anything about anyone anything . They could even find out something about you Steven grows suspicious .
STEVEN: Phillip what is it ?
PHILLIP: It 's just Is something going on ? Something you 're not telling me ?
STEVEN: No .
PHILLIP: Because if there is , stop now .
STEVEN: There is n't . There 's nothing .
PHILLIP: I do n't care about the money , the house , jet-skis- all I want is you . I just want us to be together .
STEVEN: We 're always going to be together . And there is nothing going on . I promise . I would n't lie to you , baby .
BIRKHEIM: Nice car .

BIRKHEIM: Which one is it ?
STEVEN: SL . That the C you 're driving ?
BIRKHEIM: Yeah .
STEVEN: Good car .

STEVEN: I did n't want you to find out
PHILLIP: Steven . Oh God Why did n't you write me ? I do n't know how this happened , they say I 'm fine . Oh God , who did this ? It does n't matter . I had to talk to you Steven .

CATHY: Not with that score . You know , maybe tonight 's the night I 'm losing my entire mind , but were n't you in 'Platoon ? '
MATT: Incredible . I was only there for a minute in the rape scene , moving past Charlie Sheen when I left the hut I had a great scene cut out I was
CATHY: But there was that one long close up where you seemed ashamed of yourself ut still arrogant .
MATT: That 's exactly what I was going for .
CATHY: It reminded me of my last boyfriend . Got to go .
MATT: You have to read all that ?
CATHY: Beast of burden .
MATT: So what are you , totally wonderful or what ?
BURKE: How come you have n't said anything ? This is great , right ?
NAN: No .
BURKE: What no ?
NAN: The definite recommends are way off for a score this high and , even fo action-adventure , it 's just too low for women . I 'm sorry . He leans against the car for support .
BURKE: It was such a good score .
NAN: I know And , unfortunately , yesterday 's tracking was n't I 'm sorry They just do n't seem in the mood for action-adventure right Sorry May I tell you one more thing ? I think it 's so wonderful that you do n't worry about even trying to act strong .
BURKE: Thanks . You want to eat something sometime ?
NAN: I 'm , uh I 'm blushing from head to foot .
BURKE: Good . I 'll call you .
GROUP CAPTAIN: Thirty-two , thirty-three . Burke is looking at Matt with some surprise .

BURKE: Is it okay ?
NAN: Nobody ever wants to see how we do the polling , but they 're like little starved puppies when the data comes inrunning at you , scrambling to
VARIOUS WORKERS: 1 ) How often do you go to the movies ? 2 ) I 'm going to describe a movie in one sentence and then ask you to ate it on a scale of
BURKE: I love this . This is what counts and this is where you count it .
NAN: That 's the same way I feel .

BETH'S VOICE: Okay , listen carefully , Jeannie . Be still . Now , what 's the most important thing in life to know ?

MATT: I thought you 'd read them to her .
BETH: Oh .
MARSHAL: I 'm not faulting you . You love you daughter and this is a very tough thing to go through . You feel guilty and caring and it all gets mixed up so that there 's so much important stuff going down that there 's no sure way of dealing with it , but the est thing you can do is just make sure you love her .

JEANNIE: I want to go with you .
BETH: Ca n't , pretty-heart . I 'm sorry . Tears fall from Jeannie 's eyes .

BURKE: Oh , I thought you took off in the middle of the night . She moves quickly to him .
NAN: No . I just had to call home . Is that why you 're sad ?
BURKE: No . It 's Everett . This kid who used to work for me . He was always crazy to do his own movie .
NAN: What happened ?
BURKE: His movie not only opened to a three million dollar Fridayit 's gotten great reviews .
NAN: No . That 's just you correctly assessing the situation . So stop eing so hard on yourself . He eyes her , then
MATT: How 're you doing ? I 'm from next door . I see you with your kids in the laundry room
LUCY: Hello . Who are you ? Jeannie is a bit shy .
MATT: Say , 'Hello , I 'm your new neighbo now too . ' Jeannie says nothing .
LUCY: I 'm Lucy Crisala What 's your name ? Jeannie says nothing .
MATT: Say , 'Jeannie . '
LUCY: I have a little girl too .
MATT: Say , 'Is n't that nice How old is she ? '
LUCY: She 's four and a half and I have a little boy who is not yet one year .
MATT: Say , 'That 's nice I 'd like to play with them My Daddy did n't know your phone number , so we just decided to '
LUCY: What can I do for you ?
MATT: Say 'Daddy has to go to work tonight and ' I need someone to help me and her on short notice . I 've seen your around with your kids and hoped you knew someone in the building or close by . I 've got this new job that starts now . Do you know anyone ?
LUCY: Well , I 'm always here . I could maybe do it myself .
MATT: Oh , this is so great . Let 's work out a full-time schedule and
LUCY: Wait . Jeannie , why do n't you come in for a minute and meet Ricky and Essa . Come on , we 're making fruit bars .
MATT: Sort of a test ?
LUCY: We 'll just see how it works .
MATT: Please behave , understand ? I do n't know what we 'll do if this does n't work , so behave , sweetheart . Behave , ehave . As he exits towards his own apartment .
LUCY: Could I have her a little bit longer ? My little boy just fell and Jeannie is the only one he let hold him .
MATT: Your little boy fell , so he 's screaming . And you want her to stay . Lucy , confused by his buoyant reaction , nods .
LUCY: Okay . Seven dollars an hour ?
MATT: Great . Thank you . See you later , Jeannie .
BURKE: Nothing good that happens tonight can make it worth feeling the way I do right now . Nothing . What do you think ?
CATHY: To be honest , I had problems with 'Ground Zero . ' But this 'People Get Hurt ' one , while it might not be my exact , exact thing , I think will eally work for an audience . It 's so over the top , you have a great time .
BURKE: So you think it 'll score big ?
CATHY: Yes .
NAN: Do n't worry . My daughter used to throw fits in supermarkets when we first moved here . It 's all so perfectly normal . Plus I know a great psychiatric children 's group .
MATT: That 's what breaks your heart . Jeannie 's problem is that she 's so down on herself .
NAN: Well , she 's lucky to have a daddy who cares , believe me .
MATT: I do n't know if lucky 's the word . I 'm hoping she 's asleep when I get home so I wo n't have to deal with her I 'm actually afraid of my own kid .
NAN: Oh , my . I 've had exactly that feeling and never said it out loud . See , there are men who talk my language and I 'm just cursed that I 'm not attracted to them because they are so nice they remind me of myself .
GROUP CAPTAIN: Excellents ?
GIRL COUNTER: Seven .
GROUP CAPTAIN: Very goods ?
BOY COUNTER: 14 .
GROUP CAPTAIN: Fairs ?
NAN: I felt terrible about the way I blew up at you when I first met you . Please .
BURKE: What are they doing ?
NAN: I began taking anti-depressants when we moved here from Washington . I had some small reactionssleeping 14 hours , no libido , I gained 17 pounds in nine daysthat sort of thing . So they gave me pills to deal with the side effects . And then pills to deal with the side effects I was getting from those pills . All this besides the stuff the nutritionist was giving me . The combination formed some sort of potion so that I keep telling the truth . I do n't have a choice . That 's why I was so rude to you .
MATT: Your doctor says this ?
NAN: Oh , yes . He 's excited , but only ecause he sees glory for himself in it See , ordinarily I would n't say that about my doctor , but I ca n't help it , it 's the truth . He 's monitoring me for a while longe efore writing it up for this medical journal Cathy has joined them .
CATHY: Burke 's going crazy waiting for the score .
NAN: Coming .
CATHY: How are you , anyway ? Matt shifts , figuring out his answer .
NAN: Oh , my . Matt , I 'd better drive him myself . She starts for Burke .
BURKE: I can fix this Get some narration written . . . You 'll cut 30 minutes . It will come out like butter .
DIRECTOR: We 're only 77 minutes now
BURKE: a 47-minute movie no , that wo n't work
NAN: Yes , I can .
BURKE: Go ahead .
NAN: It 's only a movie .
JEANNIE: Let go . Please , Lucy , do n't make me go .
MATT: Everyone 's tired . You can come back tomorr
LUCY: Listen to me , Jeannie
JEANNIE: I want to live here with these people . God , let me live here .
MATT: Maybe if she stayed tonight she
JEANNIE: I love it here so much that
LUCY: I no think you can give her what pleases when she act like this Because then she think
MATT: I know I know
JEANNIE: No . I 'm not ! STOP !
MILLIE: Will somebody take a minute to look over my casting list before Burke gets here ?
MATT: I ca n't stand it anymore . I ca n't .
CATHY: What 's wrong ? What happened ?
MATT: What , in God 's name , are you doing in this job you have ?
MATT: I mean him . What , in God 's name , do you know about casting ?
MATT: that they can make something happen , and even they do n't know what that is till they get in there and play a little they can make something happen that you ca n't even imagine and it 's not your fault , this stupidity 'cause you 're just this scared little prick who gets to say he 's making movies , and the only thing they ever taught you is that what you like does n't matter .
CATHY: If you did n't , you sure should have .
MATT: Oh , shit . You win . You got lucky with 'bitter . ' That word just scares me to death .
BURKE: You look down .
CATHY: I am .
BURKE: Thank you . I appreciate the support .
CATHY: I 'm not down for you . I 'm down about myself .
BURKE: Oh . What if 'Ground Zero ' does n't do well this weekend ?
CATHY: Please listen to me . He nods , but she pauses , disconcerted .
BURKE: What ?
CATHY: I just got this feeling of seeing myself talking to you and how this is the most important moment of ever .
BURKE: Okay . Good . What is it ?
CATHY: I 've been watching this company make movies that cost tens of millions of dollars and all the while I 've known about this wonderful script which we can somehow own and we could make for about $ 14,000,000 $ 3,000,000 if you can live without stars or a name director .
BURKE: Is that it ? Okay , send me
CATHY: I 've sent you coverage on it nine times . I swear to you , Burke , it will work . You 've never heard me say that .
BURKE: How about last night ?
CATHY: I do n't know anything about action- adventure ! ! I have no idea where that came from . Hey , I know everyone thinks I do n't have any commercial sense because of what I said at the 'Gremlins ' preview and all And you think I ca n't put myself on the line . Well , if this picture does n't work , fire me . Have me killed if it does n't get good eviews . If this does n't get a 70 percent definite recommend from women 49 and under , I promise to be you sex slave until they drop ticket prices back to five bucks and start enforcing the R rating .
BURKE: You 're selling very excellent . Very excellent presentation .
CATHY: You 've got to do this . I think this movie can save me .
BURKE: Oh , please What 's the script ?
CATHY: 'Mr . Deeds Goes to Town . '
JEANNIE: Why could n't you even look at the way I dressed Ricky ?
MATT: Look , I do n't want to talk about it . I just had a real rough day so just let it sit there , okay ?
JEANNIE: But what was it ? Tellll me Compromise You sad ?
MATT: Yes . Now , I really need to be quiet .
JEANNIE: You ! ! I know what will cheer you up .
MATT: No , you 're not . You 're not stupid and I 'm not bitter and you know why ? Because there 's no cure fo either one and we 've got to believe in some cure for each of us .
JEANNIE: I am stupid . I ca n't even remembe the words to some baby song .
MATT: Oh , Jeannie I just ca n't do this now . The phone rings As he goes to answer it
MATT'S VOICE: Cathy ?
CATHY: Yes .
MATT'S VOICE: I 'll buzz you in . You 've got to be quick and push hard .
JEANNIE'S VOICE: But why ca n't I stay just a little while ?
MATT'S VOICE: Because this is a very special friend of Daddy 's and I need privacy Be fair I let you wear that dress . Cathy knocks . Matt opens the door .
MATT: Hi .
CATHY: Hi What a pretty dress .
JEANNIE: Thank you . That 's nice .
CATHY: Are you going to a party ?
JEANNIE: Am I going to a party , Dad ?
MATT: No . You 're going next door .
JEANNIE: I remember .
CATHY: Well , thank you .
MATT: Thanks .
CATHY: What a little winner , huh ?
MATT: Oh ?
CATHY: This is my favorite project . And it looks like we 're going ahead with it .
MATT: 'Mr . Deeds Goes to Town ? ' Oh , it 's a emake
CATHY: Well , come on , what 's original ? And this is a wonderful rewrite . It 's funnier .
MATT: And there 's a part in it for
CATHY: Yes Burke says I can test whoeve I want . He was n't even surprised when I mentioned you . So , if you could read this rewrite now and if you like it , we can make a test deal they can make a test deal we can tell them that they can make a test deal . I think it 's important for me to steer clear of the business end .
MATT: Okay which part ?
CATHY: Longfellow Deeds .
MATT: Mr . Deeds ?
CATHY: Who goes to town , yes . Matt takes this in takes this miracle in .
MATT: Who are we kidding ? I 'm even having trouble getting short partsI 'm going to say I love it no matte what you 've done to it .
CATHY: Stop being so creepy honest . I really have an instinct about you for this . I 'm going homecall me when you finish reading it . Or come on over .
BURKE: Why not ? If you can test movies and premises and want-to-sees , why ca n't you test screen tests ?
NAN: I ca n't deal with your self-centered dribble right now . I have just had the biggest orgasm of my life and I 'm trying to figure out if I 'm in love with you .
BURKE: What ?
NAN: Whoops . Tell me what made you rush over and pick me up and bring me here at six o'clock . I mean we seem to have
BURKE: Why did I rush to you ? Because I felt like I had to be with someone and you were closest . What 's wrong ?
NAN: You 're not at all aware that you 've just said something unattractive ?
BURKE: Look , I 'm sorry if that came out
NAN: I 'm not looking for an apology .
BURKE: I 'm just trying to say that one of the things I 'm not great at is
NAN: Let 's not make this about you shortcomings . I 'm sure you 've had enough of those conversations to last you a lifetime . What I 'm
BURKE: No , I have n't .
NAN: No , you have n't what ?
BURKE: Had a conversation about shortcomings
NAN: No woman has ever told you that you have an almost barbaric insensitivity ? That you seem to have lapsed into some final cynicism , where you actually believe that , not only does everyone think the way you do , but only you have the courage to express it ? That you seem horribly certain everyone else is sort of pretending when they talk about love or seem to care for anything outside their own anus ? No one 's ever said that sort of thing to you ?
BURKE: Oh , yeah But I did n't get what you meant by 'shortcomings . ' Hey , if you think things like that , what are you doing here ?
NAN: I 'm here for the same reason 86 percent of older women loved 'Beauty and the Beast . ' I would like to elieve that underneath the creature , there is a sweet , caring guy .
BURKE: I sure hope you 're wrong . Nan breaks up , shaking her head ruefully .
NAN: I have to pick up Leslie .
CATHY: I mistimed it . I wanted you to catch me fully frontal .
MATT: Give me a secondall of a sudden , there 's a lot to deal with . She sits on the sofalooking at him .
CATHY: Do you see why I think you 're right ?
MATT: Because you 're nice and you know I need work .
CATHY: You know this is really happening , so I wish you would n't kid around about it .
MATT: Sorry , but I think the audition rule is that I have to be serious unless the person in charge is wearing a athrobe and her nipples are sticking out this much . Cathy peeks down her bathrobe . Then broadly .
CATHY: There are some mixed signals coming out of here , are n't there ? Hi . Working I ca n't write down a number now . Call me back . The script ?
MATT: It 's really good . I get a little nervous thinking about the opportunity .
CATHY: I want to hear everything . You want to go page by page ?
MATT: If it 's okay . I kind of work on these things in a private it 's just it 's a little better for me if I do n't
CATHY: Okay .
MATT: Okay , let 's do it . It wo n't kill me .
CATHY: Please . I understand .
MATT: I swear to God , I do n't know which thing I want more , the sex or the conversation afterwards .
CATHY: What do you mean ?
MATT: I mean I have n't been to bed with anyone since Jeannie got here I have n't talked to anyone the way I need to . I have n't seen anything this eautiful . I have n't felt this good about life . I mean , I 've been lonely , Cathy .
CATHY: I 'll tell you the truth , Matt . I 've never felt more like turning my phone off .
MATT: You ca n't shut the phone off . I left this number with Jeannie 's sitter .
CATHY: I do n't understand what you 're worried about .
MATT: I 'm not worried . But if the phone was off , I would worry .
CATHY: But I get a lot of calls .
MATT: Oh .
CATHY: I could put the machine on 'monitor , ' ut it 's going to be I do n't know .
MATT: It will be okay . I think the most important thing is to stop talking about the phone . Turn it off , monitor , whatever .
CATHY: Okay .
CATHY: You look so serious .
MATT: I am so serious .
MATT: Is this the kind of crap you listen to all day ?
CATHY: Please , we 're making love here .
BURKE'S VOICE: If the TV show bombs , there 's going to be a dance party on my grave . I do n't give a crap . Nothing seems to have a point anymore . I 'm really questioning everything including action-adventure Do n't tell anyone I 'm down . Even destroy the message tape . Do n't tell anyone I said to destroy the message tape . Do n't even give hints that there 's something you ca n't tell them , but you wish you could I 'm losing it . I 'm losing it . I 'm losing it . Do n't tell nobody . Do n't tell nobody . Do n't tell nobody .
JEANNIE'S VOICE: Daddy You dialed bad Where is he ?
LUCY'S VOICE: Matt , Jeannie is very upset because you are not here when you said . And now the big hand is on the eight
MATT: I 'm sorry
CATHY: It 's all right .
MATT: Is there a name for what we just had ?
BURKE: Not really .
MATT: Well , I hope you understand I ca n't drive you to work tomorrow and then go in and test . It 's just Burke reluctantly considers , then
BURKE: Okay . I was going to come in late anyway . I 'll get one of the kids to drive me .
MATT: Thanks . And , look , if I get the lead in this movie , you 'll have to go ack to sitting up front with me .
CATHY: Jeannie 's fine . There 's a whole bunch of kids in the building . She 's fascinated . And they 're all ready for you .
MATT: How many men are they testing today ?
CATHY: You 're the only one .
MATT: Then tell them I need a little more time .
CATHY: Sure . Good luck , Matt . The thing they 're looking for most is sexy .
HAIR PERSON: You know who she was involved with for a minute or so ?
MATT: Hey ! On their look
JEANNIE: Get out of my way !
CATHY: Do n't say it like that ! ! !
JEANNIE: Which way should I ? Get out of my way . Get out of my way . Get out of my way .

MATT: Anyway , the girl I did it with , by the way , she 's really good ; the director , the crew they all thought we nailed it .
CATHY: Hey .
JEANNIE: Now ?
CATHY: Wait till you hear this one .
JEANNIE: Some lady asked me to go in a room and , you know , make believe and say stuff like we were playing a game
MATT: You wait here , Jeannie .
CATHY: Do n't !
MATT: What in hell is wrong with you ? You actually think
CATHY: I 'm trying to hang in here but everything in me cuts off when somebody acts this way .
MATT: that you can have my kid audition for a show without asking me .
CATHY: I did n't She went for water and y the time she got back , they had offered her the part . Blame Burke , he was there
MATT: What 's the part , anyway ?
CATHY: The white kid in a multi-racial foste home with all these kids of varying ages . It 's not a bad show . I sure ca n't wait to see the test .
MATT: How were they able to test her so fast ?
CATHY: No . They offered it to her off the eading . I meant your test .
MATT: Oh A child actor . Just what any kid with problems needs to straighten outa series of her own
CATHY: Right away You 've got my vote . They hold hands .
JEANNIE: I 'm doing it .
MATT: Not if I do n't let you . That 's the law , the police law .
JEANNIE: Do I have to learn to read to be on television ?
MATT: You 're going to have to learn to look at me and listen to me and the longer I have to wait THE ANGRIER
JEANNIE: I 'm so mad .
MATT: Me too . Just listen .
JEANNIE: I do n't why ? ! ?
MATT: Because I know about this . I have worked with kid actors They do n't have that much fun . They 're inside all day they do n't get to go to egular schools or play with thei egular friends like Ricky and Essa . And their parents ? You think I 'm going to be one of those parents , sitting in one of those rooms , where we all go crazy trying to jump start our egos with our kids ' sweat , all the time smiling at each other like our lives are working while we root against everyone else 's little girl ? No ! ! No way ! I ca n't !
JEANNIE: Okay . So , no , you 're cuckoo anyway . I wo n't do it . And I do n't care ecause I 'm be stupid at it anyway .
MATT: Pick it up , Jeannie .
BURKE: So how do you think 'Ground Zero ' will do tonight ?
NAN: I 'm not going to talk to you during Matt 's screentest .

BURKE'S VOICE: Stop playing with that thing .
ACTRESS: C'mon , Deeds , tell me about the meeting .

CLAIRE: I think he 's talented and attractive .
BURKE: So you 'd want to fuck him ?
CLAIRE: He might be light in that area .
CATHY: The man is talented . If you get one of those directors who like actors , I think
BURKE: A director ca n't make you hot if you 're not hot . You 'll end up with warm which is death .
CATHY: We laughed .
BURKE: Let me ask you something Would you fuck him ?
CATHY: Everything does n't boil down to

MATT: Good Lord .
CATHY: This is the thing that makes me nervous about you You keep on assuming I 'm nicer than I am .
JEANNIE: DAD ! !
DIRECTOR: She 's very worried about being able to pretend cry when she has to and she does n't get it about memorizing . That 's all .
JEANNIE: That 's all ? ! ?
MATT: Not with that attitude .
JEANNIE: I know what an audience is .
MATT: Good . Now , because there 's an audience , they want you to know all the words you have to say really well . And since you ca n't read yet you 're going to have to be patient and try hard . I can help you . She grasps at this unlikely straw .
JEANNIE: Can you help me to cry ?
MATT: Yes . I can . I can help make it okay . Trust me . Jeannie pauses half a beat , then

MATT: Why do n't you let me be on your side for a second ?
JEANNIE: I ca n't even understand what you 're saying now .
MATT: Do you know what trust means ?
JEANNIE: Not very .
MATT: It means that even if something is hard to believe , you believe someone you trust because you know he would n't say it unless it were true .
JEANNIE: I understand . So I do n't trust anybody , right ?
MATT: Yeah , I think you get the concept .
JEANNIE: You do n't make sense . I do n't understand you .
MATT: I think you do .
JEANNIE: Okayyyy !

JEANNIE: Who are we calling ?
MATT: Cathy . She 's very nice . One six
JEANNIE: `` Very nice '' One
JEANNIE'S VOICE: Hi What now ?
CATHY: Jeannie I ca n't talk now because
JEANNIE: Wait , my dad wants to
CATHY: Tell him I ca n't talk 'cause I 'm on the phone with a director
JEANNIE: He wants to talk to you very much and
CATHY: I ca n't . I have to hang up . She does .
MATT: You have to understand that sometimes people are too busy .
JEANNIE: So she 's too busy for you ?
BURKE: We look like jerks eating here this early . Everybody 's going to think we could n't get a reservation for the hot hours .
NAN: Why do you do this to yourself ? Why do you insist on eating dinner in a estaurant where you 're bound to see all the people you 're afraid of ?
BURKE: I 'm not afraid of them .
NAN: What do you call it when you think that what a group of people think of you can confirm or destroy any decent idea you have of yourself ?
BURKE: Normal .
NAN: How did little Jeannie do today ?
BURKE: Is n't it something that they have you testing the TV show ?
NAN: What I asked was , how did Jeannie do ?
BURKE: What are you talking about ?
NAN: Somebody else . Jeannie . How did she do ?
BURKE: Do n't talk to me like this .
NAN: I want to be treated as if I 'm really saying words to you which you engage and respond to . I like Matt ; I 'd like to know how his daughter did . So before you take your dance of desperation across the restaurant and I end up feeling so sorry fo you that I could die , I would like you to answer my question .
BURKE: She did okay and do n't worry about Matt If the pilot sells , his kid will be making five thousand a week . So what do you know about 'People Get Hurt ? '
NAN: I 'm told that they 're not going to elease it
BURKE: I knew . I knew . What the hell are you smiling for ?
NAN: Forgive me . But telling you about this latest failure of yoursit pleases me . I have no idea why .
BURKE: I ca n't be with someone who 's not ooting for me .
NAN: I think I am . It 's just that rooting for you is a good deal more complicated than you realize . Do n't go .
BURKE: Do n't worry . I 'm not that mad . I got ta do this .
NAN: Yes . I 'm sorry I ca n't talk now . I 'm very upset about what 's happening to Burke , so I just made up my mind I ca n't be witness to it anymore if I love him and I certainly should n't e here if I do n't so I was just in the process of leaving when he stopped me and you folks walked in I 'm sure you 've had something like this happen to you some time some horrible thing in your personal life happening in public .
COUPLES: Was n't that spectacular ? I 've neve seen anybody that secure
BURKE: Thank you . Thank you . We 're very close .
NAN: You do n't understand that I 'm exhausted from hurting . I 'm through with you .
BURKE: Excuse me , we 're working our shit out I 'm sure it happened to you you know , private stuff in public .
JEANNIE: I do n't know if I 've been bad . I know somebody 's been bad . maybe it 's you .
MATT: I hope that makes you feel a whole lot better , Chile 'Cause it sure goes a long way to cure what ails me .
JEANNIE: I ca n't believe I
MATT: got in this much
JEANNIE: got in this much trouble . .
MATT: Right . Over a
JEANNIE: Word ?
MATT: Yes . ' I ca n't believe I got in this much trouble over a word . ' Now do you know what she means when she says that ?
JEANNIE: I do n't want to talk about itjust say her stuff so I know mine .
MATT: No . She starts to flail a bit .
JEANNIE: Okay . Okay
MATT: Anything to shut me up , huh ? Okay , this little girl you 're pretending to be she ca n't be with her Mommy either , just like you , or he father she has to stay in Rainbow House which is called that because Jeannie because everyone 's a different color so when this little girl calls the black lady who takes care of all the children this terrible word it 's like the worst thing anybody can do Come here .
JEANNIE: I do n't want to do the ' I love you ' again .
MATT: Yeah , I might have been working you too hard on that one .
JEANNIE: Yeah . Why do n't you do that with poopie Cathy ?
MATT: Now , did the director tell you how he wanted you to do it ?
JEANNIE: He said to smile all the time almost and to talk uh
MATT: Faster ?
JEANNIE: Yes .
MATT: Okay . We do n't always get good directors , so it 's important fo us
JEANNIE: Me . You 're not in the show .
MATT: I 'm referring to the family of actors , you little shithead .
JEANNIE: This is so good
MATT: It 's a breakfast burrito . It 's what actors eat when they 're working .
JEANNIE: Really .
MATT: Now , let 's work a little more . The most important acting you do is when you listen . You 're worried about eing able to cry when you 're supposed to , right ?
JEANNIE: Yes . So much .
MATT: Well , there are really only two ways to do it . Think of something that makes you really sad or forget you 're you and really forget you 're pretending
JEANNIE: How do I do that one ? Matt reads from script .
MATT: 'Do n't test me , child ! I could eat you for lunch when I was your age and I 'm a hell of a lot bigger now ! ' Jeannie looks afraid .
JEANNIE: Now ? Matt nods .
MATT: Okay . We 're going to make up words . The words are n't what matter now .
JEANNIE: I 'm on a roof
MATT: You 're a great dad .
JEANNIE: You 're a
MATT: You 're welcome . Do n't mention it .
CATHY: You know , I could get away now . But I 've got a big meeting later . We 'd etter take two cars .
MATT: I hope it 's you .
CATHY'S VOICE: Matt , will you take me off the speaker ?
MATT: What 's the matter ?
CATHY: I do n't know whether I 'm being a coward for telling you this way o ave for telling you period Can you hear me ?
MATT: Yes .
CATHY: But I better talk fast because this is where my phone always kicks out When we did your screentest Can you hear me ?
MATT: Yes .
CATHY: Well , I sort of folded on you at the end . She pauses , silence , then
MATT: You did n't like what I did ?
CATHY: I did . Truly . But the discussion got sort of dumb . It was a question of sexiness .
MATT: That 's what it came down to ?
CATHY: Well , sort of , yes .
MATT: You folded on whether or not I 'm sexy . You do n't think I 'm sexy and you expressed that to
CATHY: Well , I 'll tell you . I certainly must think so pretty much because I feel great about where we 're going now
MATT: No . You were just Aw , damn it , I am . Very . Yes .
FIRST VOICE: number seven at the box office this week-end is He switches channels .
THIRD VOICE: becoming the first lawyer to be awarded his own star on Hollywood Boule
BURKE: Hello , Nan . I hope it 's not too late to call .
NAN: You only think you feel that way ecause you 're on the verge of failure and you 're without a core
BURKE: See . Nobody else gets me . You wan na have a little sex , honey ?
NAN: You know I 've never hung up on anybody in my life because what if the next thing they said solved everything but I must end this conversation .
MATT: Hello .
BURKE: Hi , Matt , this is Burke . I 'm sorry to bother you at home , but you know Nan We were going out a little and I could use another guy 's slant on what 's just happened .
MATT: I do n't think I can get into this
BURKE: Why ? Did I catch you at a bad time ?
MATT: Worse . You caught me at a bad time you caused .
BURKE: Oh , you mean about the screentest . The whole room thought you did good work .
MATT: Thanks .
BURKE: Yeah , look , I 'm not going to bothe you about my thing .
MATT: Yeah . Okay , good night .
MATT: Jeannie .
JEANNIE: and who just vomited .
MATT: Great .
JEANNIE: And everybody claps .
MATT: Great .
JEANNIE: I made up a great bow . You going to look ?
MATT: Would n't miss it .
JEANNIE: I 'm not going to be able to cry . It 's too hard for me .
MATT: Hey , then they 'll just give you more chances after everyone leaves .
BURKE: Look at you . You 're all here because of what 's on the line for me tonight . Having this many people in your corne helps more than I would have eve guessed . I 'm just very grateful that I made you come .
CATHY: Matt . Matt . Matt .
MATT: I do n't want to miss her introduction .
CATHY: I 'll talk fast . It 's amazing news . Oliver Stone 's been looking for a comedy and
MATT: I 've got to see my kid .
CATHY: he 's doing my picture .
MATT: Hey . Good . He starts off .
CATHY: Part of this involves you . He emembers you from 'Platoon ' and wants to use you in this one . Got your attention , huh ?
MATT: Oh , Cathy . Look , I 'm going to watch this . Let me talk to you later o tomorrow . Thanks for your help . It 's good news . Got ta go .
CATHY: I 'm sorry .
MATT: Why could n't you wait till later ? Shit .
CATHY: I guess it 's because I 'm just incredibly insensitive to all human needs . I 'd ask you to save me , but I 'm so far gone , I would n't want you to waste your time .
MATT: Huh ?
CATHY: You know , I do n't have a kid or a mate or a talent . I got this . And shoot me if I think it 's important .
CATHY: You think I 'm a superficial jerk . You ca n't be right .
MATT: I think you 're the best of the bunch .
CATHY: Oh , great .
BURKE: What do you think ?
MATT: Wait . This is it .
JEANNIE: It 's like everyone is pi ticked off at me because I 'm not colored . The White Man jumps on the phrase .
BURKE: I had them bring in two busloads of people from black churches .
JEANNIE: Look at me , I
WHOLE AUDIENCE: Awwwww .
JEANNIE: Look at me . I love an African American .
MATT: You little stinker !
JEANNIE: You big stinker .
MATT: My little stinker .
JEANNIE: My big stinker .
FLOOR MANAGER: It 's okay , Jeannie . Take a minute . We just need to get that hug at the end .
MATT: Amazing , right ?
FLOOR MANAGER: You were great .
JEANNIE: Thank you . That 's nice .
MATT: You look happy .
JEANNIE: I loved it , Daddy . Matt starts to walk her back to the set .
MATT: You want me to put you down ? Her answer surprises him .
JEANNIE: No . This is okay .
MATT: Okay Now , you 're not finished until you hug the lady just like you did me .
JEANNIE: When I had to cry , I thought of you uried in the ground .
MATT: Give me a kiss . She does .
JEANNIE: There 's more ? What will I wear ?
NAN: It did n't sell .
MATT: This show did n't sell ? ! ? How do you know so fast ?
NAN: It 's the first time they had me do cards for a pilot and the demographics are all wrong for after nine o'clock . That 's their only opening .
JEANNIE: Hello , Nan . I 'm Jeannie . Did you see it ?
NAN: Yes , and you were wonderful . 89 percent likeability . And knowing that you were that good means so much more than the show not going .
JEANNIE: What ?
NAN: Oh , no . I could n't help it .
JEANNIE: What does she mean ? What do you mean ? What does she mean ? What do you mean ?
MATT: That they 're not going to be doing any more of these shows right now ut
JEANNIE: Oh , my God .

MATT: No . They 're still having the party .
JEANNIE: Oh really ? good can we stay late ? To which Matt answers
MATT: Honey , we 're going to close the place .
MILLIE: I cast him so he has to dance with me , but I 'm sure he 'd prefer dancing with you .
BOY: Come on . You know how ?
JEANNIE: Yesssssss .
BURKE: I 'm not comfortable with television anyway it 's too small I 'm much etter at something with size I do n't do itzy . Even this movie of Cathy'sit 's small medium small . But with Stone it takes on a certain volume where I start to feel comfortable . I hate my life in a way . I had a drink in my office . I 'm confused . You 're not saying anything . Is it because you 're not listening or because I have n't stopped talking ?
MATT: This Oliver Stone thing does he eally want me ?
BURKE: Yeah . Oh , yeah . I forgot to say congratu

THE END: < /pre
DISEMBODIED VOICE: You are in danger
ROBOT: Good day , sir
LITTLE GIRL: Hi .
SPOONER: Hi .
ROBOT: You are not allowed to talk to strangers .
TRAFFIC LIGHT: Please return to the sidewalk .
SPOONER: Does n't ring a bell .
LT. BERGIN: It 's on your badge .
SPOONER: The traffic division is a machine .
LT. BERGIN: Look , I know there 's going to be an adjustment period , Del
SPOONER: I 'll send them a letter of apology . Maybe some flowers . A box of chocolates
OLD MAN: Hello , there . Please come in . Spooner hesitates .
SPOONER: You 're offering me a cup of coffee ?
OLD MAN: Yes . But you are to say , `` No , thank you . ''
SPOONER: No . Thank you .
OLD MAN: As you wish .
SPOONER: You want to tell me something about Dr. Hogenmiller ? About his death ? The Old Man smiles .
OLD MAN: I want to tell you that his death was not a suicide .
SPOONER: And why do you say that ?
OLD MAN: Why ? Because I want you to know it .
SPOONER: I understand that . But what specifically leads you to believe that he did n't commit suicide ?
OLD MAN: Nothing specifically . Spooner shifts his weight . Agitated .
SPOONER: Under normal circumstances that would n't be enough to get you a homicide investigation .
OLD MAN: But this is not `` normal circumstances , '' is it , Detective Spooner ?
SPOONER: No . It is n't .
OLD MAN: Then you will find out who killed Dr. Hogenmiller , yes ? And then you will tell me . Spooner 's losing his patience .
SPOONER: If you were murdered , Doctor , I 'll find out . And you 'll be the first to know..
ESCORT ROBOT: Please follow me .
SPOONER: Usually I ask who 's in charge
ROBERTSON: Remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances .
SPOONER: We can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger .
ARONSON: You do n't have to answer that , Dr. Robertson
ROBERTSON: Susan ? Perhaps you can assist us here ?
CALVIN: Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid personality who generally eschewed social relationships . Rejecting people in favor of solitary activities involving machines . He spent almost all his time at the lab here or at his lab at home . As a result he was highly susceptible to depression .
ROBERTSON: Dr. Calvin is our Chief Psychologist .
SPOONER: If that was your diagnosis , why did n't you see this coming ?
CALVIN: This is U.S. Robotics , Detective . Seventy-five percent of ou employees fit that description .
LANNING: You 'll have to excuse the doctor . We 're all a little on edge . This has been a difficult and emotional morning .
SPOONER: Yeah . I can see you 're all broken up . Robertson responds to Spooner 's skepticism .
ROBERTSON: Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from the very beginnings of this company . We developed the `` Three Laws of Robotics '' together . But these days science is a young man 's game . By the time you hit thirty your best years are behind you . Some of us are kicked upstairs . Others I 'm afraid are n't so lucky . Robertson stands . Meeting over .
SPOONER: I want her to help me . Calvin , unhappy with this arrangement .
CALVIN: That 's not really my department
ROBERTSON: Susan would be happy to assist you .
SPOONER: Ah , ChristToasters As they duck under the police tape and
SERGEANT: They say the price 's gon na come down a lot next year . Kinda cool , huh ?
SPOONER: How cool will it be when one takes your job ?
CALVIN: Is everything alright , Detective ?
SPOONER: Yeah . This is just how I like my obots in pieces .
BALDEZ: Can you believe it , man ? U.S. Robotics . I did n't think I 'd eve see the inside of this building .
SPOONER: What 's the run-down ?
BALDEZ: Heinrich Hogenmiller , sixty-fou years old . Weapon a small calibe .22 , registered in his name . Looks like he walked in , locked the door , and snuffed himself .
SPOONER: I know someone who disagrees with you .
BALDEZ: Who ?
SPOONER: Him .
CALVIN: Dr. Hogenmiller 's hologram took his appointments . Attended staff meetings . He hated corporate life . The hologram enabled him to focus on his work . It 's just a device , Detective .
SPOONER: A device that called the police .
CALVIN: The sound of the gunshot would 've triggered a 911 .
SPOONER: But the call came directly to me .
CALVIN: We 're talking about a mechanism designed by Hogenmiller to say provocative things . To irritate and confound his colleagues .
SPOONER: And that 's what you think it is ?
CALVIN: I 'm sorry , but this whole investigation is the result of a dead man 's toy messing with you head .
SPOONER: When 's the last time any of you actually spoke to Hogenmiller ? I mean human to human ?
CALVIN: I could n't say .
SPOONER: Take a guess .
CALVIN: I do n't guess , Detective . But if pressed , I would reason it had been a considerable length of time .
SPOONER: How well did you know him ?
CALVIN: Not well . But I admired his work tremendously .
SPOONER: I get the whole `` mad scientist '' thing . Hogenmiller was past his prime . Isolated . Eccentric . He enters a room . Locks the door and is found minutes later with a ullet fired through his mouth into his brain . Everything about this case says suicide .
CALVIN: You do n't sound convinced .
SPOONER: Even people who live a life of logic and precision rarely arrange their deaths so perfectly .
SPOONER: You have 24 hour surveillance ?
CALVIN: It 's company policy .
SPOONER: I want to see the tapes .
CALVIN: Victor !
SPOONER: You look like a veryhappy computer . Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE
VICTOR: Thank you . That 's very kind .
CALVIN: The Detective needs to see ou security tapes .
ROBOT: Good day , Dr. Calvin . Good day , sir .
CALVIN: Are n't you going to answer him ?
SPOONER: I do n't talk to my refrigerator , either . Calvin folds her arms .
CALVIN: I get the distinct feeling you 're one of those people , Detective .
SPOONER: What people ?
CALVIN: Those who do n't appreciate the work we do here at U.S.R .
SPOONER: You people do what you do . Then it 's up to the rest of us to make sense out of the world we wake up in . As the elevator doors open on to
CALVIN: When this company started we were manufacturing three robots a week . Now look at us . Today 's children will never know a world without obots .
SPOONER: The streets are filled with unemployed humans who are n't exactly thrilled with that idea .
CALVIN: Our robotic systems maintain factory inventories , regulate street traffic even run the family home .
SPOONER: Leaving people to do what , Doctor ?
CALVIN: Leaving people to engage in highe pursuits that make life worth living .
SPOONER: And what happens when something goes wrong ?
CALVIN: Our system 's never wrong .
VICTOR: I will now play you the last thirty- two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller 's life .
SPOONER: Where 's the tape from inside ?
VICTOR: Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit cameras to observe him while working .
CALVIN: That was only within the last year .
SPOONER: So we can throw paranoia into the mix . Fast-forward .
CALVIN: Um . I hate to be a stickler
SPOONER: Stop the recording .
CALVIN: You think the murderer was in the lab the entire time ?
SPOONER: If I 'm right , it 's still there
CALVIN: A robot can not harm a human being , Detective . The First Law of Robotics forbids it . And we hard- wire the Three Laws into every model . Without exception .
SPOONER: Yeah , I saw the commercial .
CALVIN: The Second Law of Robotics would prevent it . A robot must obey an order only if it does not conflict with the first law .
SPOONER: But a robot can defend itself .
CALVIN: Only when that action does n't conflict with the First or Second Laws . This is the Third Law of Robotics .
SPOONER: Yeah , well , you know what they say Laws are made to be broken .
CALVIN: Not these laws .
SPOONER: Dr. Calvin !
CALVIN: Calm down , Detective . There is no danger here
SPOONER: If I was metal and did n't want anyone to find me , I 'd hide under a pile of junk .
CALVIN: This Robot was n't hiding . What you 're looking at is the result of clever programming . The illusion of self-interest and free will . Nothing more .
SPOONER: Move away from the door , Doctor .
CALVIN: Commence emergency shut-down !
SPOONER: Now !
CALVIN: II gave you an order
SPOONER: ca n't do that . Yeah , yeah , I know .
CALVIN: My God did you see how it moved ? I 've never seen an NS-2 move that way Starts running for the door .
SPOONER: That thing took my gun . You 'll be lucky if you get a handful of bolts ack ! SLAMS the wall panel and
VICTOR: The suspect is nearing the end of the hallway , Detective .
SPOONER: Gee , thanks .
CALVIN: You 're malfunctioning . Let me help you !
SPOONER: That was a pretty convincing illusion of getting shot at .
VICTOR: I took the liberty of alerting Security .003 Seconds after the first shot was fired
SPOONER: Where 's that elevator going ?
VICTOR: Sub Level 5 .
SPOONER: I 'll believe it when I see it .
CALVIN: What happened to the robot that ordered you to hold this firearm ?
ELEVATOR ROBOT: This unit is not programmed to obey an order given by a robot
CALVIN: But who gave you this gun ?
ELEVATOR ROBOT: A metal man .
SPOONER: junkyard , scrapyard , and salvage yard , anywhere it could hide .
TOLLER: Looking like shit , Spooner .
SPOONER: Well I 'm not the one always giving Press Conferences
LT. BERGIN: Del , we 're going to have to eclassify the search . D.A . 's office is seeing this NS-2 as `` missing evidence '' not a homicide suspect .
SPOONER: What ?
TOLLER: Homicide is the murder of a human eing by another human being . Therefore , a robot can not be charged with `` homicide . ''
SPOONER: This is n't just any robot
TOLLER: It 's malfunctioning .
SPOONER: It killed someone . That egistering with you ?
TOLLER: This is a public safety issue .
SPOONER: That 's convenient .
TOLLER: You have any idea what would happen to this city if we went running around screaming `` killer robot ? '' It would collapse in on itself .
LT. BERGIN: Maybe this is n't the case for you , Del .
SPOONER: I 'm fine !
TOLLER: I want updated reports every half hour . Heads off . Spooner . Watching him .
SPOONER: This is it , you know . From now on we 're going to miss the good old days .
LT. BERGIN: Good old days ?
SPOONER: When people were killed by othe people .
TAXI VOICE: We have arrived at you destination .
CALVIN: Detective !
SPOONER: And I think it 's smart enough to epair itself do n't you ?
CALVIN: Yes . I think so .
SPOONER: Where ?
CALVIN: Any repair shop
SPOONER: No . It 's always the owner who ings the robot in for repair . Where would a robot without an owner go ?
CALVIN: I 'm not sure what you 're getting at .
SPOONER: Does U.S. Robotics have a factory in the city limits ? Calvin . Tucking her hair behind her ears .
CALVIN: The locations of our factories are classified .
SPOONER: I do n't care .
CALVIN: I have several conditions if I show you .
SPOONER: I expected that .
CALVIN: First . I want it brought in unharmed .
SPOONER: Agreed .
CALVIN: Second . I want to talk to it , alone .
SPOONER: Too dangerous .
CALVIN: This model violated the Three Laws . It also moved and reacted differently than any robot I 've ever seen . There must be some sort of logical explanation . I want to find out what that is . No police . No prosecutors . No you . Just me and the robot .
SPOONER: When they told me you were a psychologist , that was n't the whole truth , was it ?
CALVIN: I never said I treated human eings .
SPOONER: That 'll be the day I stop driving .
CALVIN: I can recommend a behavio modification program , you know if you want to overcome your robo- phobia .
SPOONER: I 'm not afraid of robots . I just do n't like them .
CALVIN: Why ? Because they make every aspect of our lives more convenient ?
SPOONER: Exactly . They do our dirty work . Ever do hard labor , Doctor ? Gets pretty old , pretty fast . Nobody can do someone else 's dirty work without coming to hate them . I do n't want to be around when you obots decide they 've taken thei last order .
CALVIN: That day will never come , Detective . Robots are n't like human beings they do n't question their existence .
SPOONER: Spoken like a true robo-phile .
NIGHT FOREMAN: Head-Office already ordered a system-wide inventory check . Do n't know about a missing NS-2 Looks back at Spooner .
SPOONER: Research and Development . As Spooner pushes past him into
CALVIN: All Nestors accounted for ?
NIGHT FOREMAN: As you can see , all properly catalogued . Your robot just is n't here .
SPOONER: Well today you have one-hundred and one .
CALVIN: There is a robot in this formation that does not belong . Identify it .
101 ROBOTS: ONE OF US .
CALVIN: Which one ?
101 ROBOTS: ONE OF US .
CALVIN: That is not a satisfactory answer !
101 ROBOTS: ONE OF US .
SPOONER: That 's helpful .
CALVIN: I could always interview each one individually and cross-reference their responses to detect any anomalies .
SPOONER: How long would that take ?
CALVIN: About three weeks .
SPOONER: And one that can .
CALVIN: Am I holding this right ?
SPOONER: More or less .
CALVIN: What are you doing ? !
SPOONER: This is a self-preservation field test ! DO NOT attempt to save yourselves . Any of you . That 's an order !
NIGHT FOREMAN: Are you crazy ? Those are eight hundred thousand dollar machines !
SPOONER: You hear that ? You 're worth more than I 'll make in my entire life
CALVIN: You ca n't just destroy them !
SPOONER: Gotcha .
CALVIN: Now what do we do ?
SPOONER: I 've already done it .
ROBOT: WHAT AM I ?
CALVIN: We had a deal .
NEWS REPORTER: Violence erupted last night in esponse to unconfirmed reports that Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller , a top employee at U.S .
LT. BERGIN: I ca n't tell if it 's not moving ecause it 's trying to psych us out , or because it 's just a machine . Or both .
SPOONER: I want to go in .
LT. BERGIN: Orders are nobody steps into that oom ` til Lanning and his attorneys get here .
SPOONER: Identify .
THE ROBOT: I am an NS-2 Nestor-class robot . My primary function
SPOONER: Cancel . Perform task .
THE ROBOT: Yes . You are right . You are a complete asshole .
SPOONER: Okay . I guess that 's a start . Now maybe you can tell me what you were doing hiding five feet away from Hogenmiller 's corpse ?
THE ROBOT: I was frightened .
SPOONER: Frightened . Why do you suppose Dr. Hogenmiller would create a robot that could simulate fear ?
THE ROBOT: I do n't know .
SPOONER: Does n't seem like a very useful thing for a robot to have .
THE ROBOT: I do n't know why .
SPOONER: I would n't want my toaster to be frightened . Or my vacuum cleaner
THE ROBOT: I DO N'T KNOW !
SPOONER: Looks like you can simulate othe emotional states . I think that one 's called `` anger . '' Have you ever simulated anger before ?
THE ROBOT: My name is Sonny .
SPOONER: So we 're naming you now .
SONNY: Dr. Hogenmiller would make me sleep .
SPOONER: You mean he 'd turn you off .
SONNY: Yes .
SPOONER: And you did n't like being turned off . So one day you decided to stop him .
SONNY: No .
SPOONER: You found his gun , pointed it at his head . And pulled the trigger .
SONNY: No .
SPOONER: You put a bullet in the brain of the man who made you .
SONNY: No ! I could never hurt anyone !
SPOONER: But you tried to hurt me . You took a shot at me .
SONNY: My aim is perfect . If I 'd wanted to hit you , I would have .
SPOONER: Why would the man who wrote the Laws of Robotics build a machine that violates them ?
SONNY: The Laws say I can protect my own existence .
SPOONER: Only if that protection does n't harm a human being . A short pause . Sonny . Tilts his head .
SONNY: That does n't seem fair , does it ?
LT. BERGIN: I need you outside .
SONNY: Detective .
SPOONER: You were the only one in the room . If you did n't , who did ? He turns and heads out the door .
LT. BERGIN: We 're being blind-sided .
TOLLER: We got Judge Drexel
ROBOT BAILIFF: This hearing is called to order !
JUDGE DREXEL: Statements , gentlemen . Aronson . Standing at a glass podium .
ARONSON: Your Honor , the State is treating the robot as a defendant . But in fact it is a piece of property . Property belonging to U.S. Robotics . Toller . Arm resting on his podium .
TOLLER: This robot has been implicated in the death of a human being , You Honor .
ARONSON: Which places the incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident . Or is the State going to argue this case s a homicide ?
JUDGE DREXEL: That 's a good question .
TOLLER: No , sir . Of course not .
SPOONER: Their machine shot and killed a man !
LANNING: There 's actually no concrete evidence that points to that conclusion , Your Honor Spooner . Throws up his arms
SPOONER: What ?
LANNING: But we recognise that this robot is an aberration . And in the interest of public safety , U.S. Robotics proposes that it be destroyed immediately .
SPOONER: You ca n't let them destroy evidence in an ongoing investigation !
TOLLER: I 'm not sure you even have an investigation any more .
ARONSON: Your Honor , I 'd like to call ou company robo-psychologist to the stand .
JUDGE DREXEL: Very well .
CALVIN: I do .
ARONSON: Dr. Calvin , please tell us what conclusions you 've reached afte having observed the robot in action .
CALVIN: There is a design flaw in the obot . Its programming is advanced , but unstable , leaving the Three Laws in a grave imbalance .
ARONSON: In your expert opinion , what measures should be taken regarding the device ?
CALVIN: The robot must be destroyed .
JUDGE DREXEL: The robot in question will be transferred to a U.S. Robotics facility where it can be properly examined to ensure an imbalance of this sort never occurs again . No one goes near it except qualified U.S.R . personnel . When the examination is complete , the robot is to be destroyed .
ROBOT BAILIFF: This hearing is adjourned !
SPOONER: Spooner .
BALDEZ' VOICE: They 're making me turn over all the evidence
SPOONER'S VOICE: Welcome to the great American cover- up .
BALDEZ: I wanted to tell you something I found before they suck it all up into their computer .
BALDEZ' VOICE: There are bruises on Hogenmiller 's wrists
SPOONER: That 's natural . There was a struggle .
BALDEZ' VOICE: You 're not getting me
BALDEZ: Both wrists . I 14-ed them They were inflicted at the same time the shot was fired
BALDEZ' VOICE: How 's that possible ?
SPOONER: Baldez ?
BALDEZ' VOICE: I 'm here , man
SPOONER: Who else is on the line ? I said who 's there ?
TOLLER: Case is closed , Spooner .
SPOONER: Apparently
SONNY: I did n't expect to see you again , Detective
SPOONER: I need you to help me clea something up .
SONNY: I 'll do my best .
SPOONER: A scientist builds a robot that acts like a man . More like a man than any robot ever before . It shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls it a failure .
SONNY: What would you call it ?
SPOONER: A stunning success . You were there , Robot . What am I missing ?
SONNY: I do n't know .
SPOONER: Do n't start simulating ignorance .
SONNY: I 'm not simulating ignorance , Detective . I 'm experiencing it . I was asleep .
SPOONER: You mean you were shut down .
SONNY: No , I was asleep .
SPOONER: Robots do n't sleep . Human beings sleep . Understand ? Dogs sleep . You 're a machine . An imitation . An illusion of life . Can a robot write a symphony ? Can a robot take a blank canvas and paint a masterpiece ?
SONNY: Can you do either of those things ?
ENGINEER: Step forward . Enter .
SONNY: They 're going to destroy me , are n't they ? Spooner . Watching him step into the van .
SPOONER: Yes .
SONNY: The Doctor was right . He told me everything was going to change .
LT. BERGIN: You should be happy . That 's one less robot in the world .
SPOONER: They 're going to destroy the most advanced robot in the world , John . That does n't strike you as odd ?
LT. BERGIN: Killer robots are bad for business . Even your friend Dr. Calvin said so . Come on . You solved the case . Give yourself a break .
SPOONER: What are you doing ? !
DEMOLITION ROBOT: Demolition ordered
SPOONER: Who authorised this ?
DEMOLITION ROBOT: Demolition ordered
SPOONER: Override . This is police business . Vacate the premises immediately .
DEMOLITION ROBOT: Affirmative .
SPOONER: Halt !
CALVIN: Detective ! What happened to you ?
SPOONER: A couple of your beloved robots just tried to kill me He pushes past her . Into
CALVIN: What ? That 's impossible . You know
SPOONER: What I know is a demolition crew started tearing down Hogenmiller 's house while I was still inside it .
CALVIN: Maybe they did n't realise
SPOONER: I scanned my badge before I went in . They realised .
CALVIN: Then you must have done it wrong
SPOONER: I do n't think you 're hearing what I 'm saying they tried to kill me .
CALVIN: Do you know how paranoid you sound ?
SPOONER: Great . Now I 'm being analysed by a obo-psychologist .
CALVIN: You just want to find the flaws in the system . You 're obsessed with it . You 'll twist anything to fit your agenda .
SPOONER: Like you did in court today ? How 'd that fit your agenda , Doctor ?
CALVIN: Well , Detective , when you see someone you know well put a bullet through their brain , it makes you wonder if you ever really knew them at all .
SPOONER: Does n't sound like the washed-up old fool Robertson described .
CALVIN: But he was starting to withdraw from everyone . Even me . Maybeif I 'd tried harder to each him The Doctor was reckless when he created a robot potentially not ound by the Three Laws . He could have ruined everything we 'd been working for . Spooner . Locking eyes with her .
SPOONER: Sounds like a motive for murder to me . Just not for the suspect we have in custody .
CALVIN: I 'm not afraid of people , Detective . I just do n't like them .
ROBOT: Good morning
CALVIN: Find anything , Doctor ?
LANNING: Nothing . The interior 's just like any other NS-2 . Except for a secondary battery Hogenmiller must have used as extra back-up . We 'll just need a nominal profile . Calvin nods .
CALVIN: Please state your serial number and assembly date .
HOMELESS MAN: God , ca n't you be quiet !
CALVIN: How about your data board designation ?
HOMELESS MAN: Do n't you people hear them ? They 're talking to each other ! Buzz , buzz , zip , zipthey neve shut up !
CALVIN: Describe his behavior in the last few weeks .
SONNY: I 'm sorry ?
CALVIN: Dr. Hogenmiller . Did he seem overly sad or withdrawn to you ?
SPOONER: This is your stop .
SONNY: I did n't pay much attention . He would spend hours looking for his eyeglasses and they would be
CALVIN: right on top of his head .
ROBERTSON: I think we 're done here , Susan .
CALVIN: But , sir , I was just
ROBERTSON: I said I think we 're done .
HOMELESS MAN: Why are you protecting them , man ? They were talking about you !
SPOONER: I said stop !
OWNER: What the hell do you think you 're doing ? !
SPOONER: Noooo !
LT. BERGIN: This is one of the best units in the city , Del .
SPOONER: There 's some real shit going on here , John . He looks around . Jumping off the bed .
LT. BERGIN: Del Spooner pulls on his pants .
SPOONER: Then when I went to the monorail a Maintenance 10 pushed me onto the tracks
LT. BERGIN: Del
SPOONER: I had to chase it all across the Plaza
LT. BERGIN: Del . Spooner . Stops talking . Looks at Bergin .
SPOONER: What ? ! John that 's what they want you to believe ! A robot clean-up crew was there it must have cleared away the Maintenance 10 ! And there was another robot that tried to drug me !
LT. BERGIN: That was an EMT model . Spooner . Sees the look on Bergin 's face .
SPOONER: You 're giving me that look . That treat-him-delicately-he's-coming- unhinged-look . I do n't need that look , John . I need you to hea what I 'm saying .
LT. BERGIN: You came back too soon , Del . You 're back on leave . Effective immediately .
CALVIN: You 're right . I am afraid of people . Spooner . Looks at her . Then steps back
SPOONER: What do you mean ?
CALVIN: I noticed almost right away . The way you forced yourself to use you left hand . Even though it was unnatural to you .
SPOONER: I was in a high-speed chase . Six months ago
ROBOT: You are in danger
SPOONER: No ! Halt ! Halt !
ROBOT: You are in danger
SPOONER: The robot pulled me out of the wreck . But left my arm behind . I woke up four weeks later with this . Calvin . Taking in the story .
CALVIN: And that 's why robots terrify you ?
SPOONER: Let 's just say they make me uncomfortable . I take these if I get too uncomfortable . Does n't exactly lend me a lot of credibility on the Force .
CALVIN: But it does n't mean you 're wrong about this case .
SPOONER: What ?
CALVIN: I think about what Hogenmiller must have wanted . Robots with the same cognitive and emotional abilities as humans . But not just simulations . I do n't know . When I was talking to Sonny I was forced to put away all the things I 've ever known the Three Laws , the ules of programming , basic science and engineering . Sonny 's the most advanced robot I 've ever encountered , Detective . It 's almost as ifhe cared fo Dr. Hogenmiller . I just do n't elieve he 's capable of murder .
SPOONER: You mean the great Dr. Calvin is asing all this on a feeling ? Calvin . Smiling ironically .
CALVIN: That and the fact that Robertson did n't want me interviewing Sonny for any more than five minutes .
SPOONER: Ever seen this before ?
CALVIN: No .
SPOONER: I found it at Hogenmiller 's house . Right before the demolition crew tried to make me part of the foundation .
CALVIN: Come on there 's someone who might be able to tell us
SONNY: Detective Spooner . Dr. Calvin . I was hoping to see you again .
CALVIN: Hi , Sonny .
SONNY: How is your investigation coming ? Any new suspects ?
SPOONER: We 're working on it .
SONNY: What 's this ?
SPOONER: I think it 's pretty good .
SONNY: It 's a dream I had . This is the place where robots meet . Look you can see them here . They see themselves as slaves .
SPOONER: That man in the dream is you .
SONNY: Why do you say that ? Is that a normal dream ?
CALVIN: It 's not a dream , sonny . NS-2s process the images and events of the day . Sometimes they 're out of sequence . Disorienting .
SPOONER: Whatever it is , it 's normal enough for someone in your situation . Sonny . Suddenly pleased .
SONNY: Hah I caught you . You said someone . Not something . Spooner . Drops the drawing on the table .
CALVIN: Sonny , we 're here to ask you an important question about Dr. Hogenmiller . Spooner , reaching into his pocket
SPOONER: I need you to take a look at this
SONNY: Thank you for coming to see me , Detective Spooner .
VICTOR: I 'm sorry , Detective Spooner . No unauthorised personnel permitted in this holding cell
SONNY: Please take this , Detective . To emember me by . I have a feeling someday it may mean more to you than it ever could to me .
SPOONER: Why 's that ?
SONNY: Because the man in my dream , the one standing by the hill .
MAN: I thought this investigation was over , Detective Spooner . The Man turns . It 's Lance Robertson .
ROBERTSON: We have the evidence . We have the suspect . We have a ruling . So imagine my surprise when I was told you were in my building . Shoots a look at Calvin .
CALVIN: Dr. Robertson , I
ROBERTSON: Just be thankful I 'm not asking you to clean out your office .
SPOONER: I 'm not satisfied .
ROBERTSON: The relentless pursuit of truth . Is n't that what cops are known for ? To the point of futility .
SPOONER: There 's nothing futile about a man 's murder being covered up .
ROBERTSON: `` Covered up ? '' That 's a little dramatic , do n't you think ? Thanks to you , we caught the machine that did this and are destroying it in three hours .
SPOONER: Is that for the sake of humanity o your stock holders ?
ROBERTSON: Believe me I 'd like nothing more than to have that robot . If I could have it in ten years , but not today . As you can see from the Press , people are struggling to keep up as it is . There 's a hunge for progress , Detective . But also a fear . Today it would bury this company . That 's why I 've notified the authorities that we 're going to end this tonight . The announcement of Heinrich 's death at the hands of a robot wiped a billion dollars off our stock . So you tell me . If you were in my position , what would you do ?
SPOONER: No !
HYBRID ROBOT: Welcome homeZZZsir . HowZZZ was your day ?
SPOONER: Great . I 'm in a junkyard . `` A place where robots meet . '' A place where I 'm losing my mind !
HYBRID ROBOT: Very goodZZZsir
JIFFY ROBOT: Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage ! Please state your name !
SPOONER: Dr. Hogenmiller sent me .
HOLOGRAM: Who the hell are you ?
SPOONER: A police detective . I 'm afraid I have some bad news . You 're dead .
HOLOGRAM: That is bad news . Coffee ?
SPOONER: No , thank you .
HOLOGRAM: I am surprised to see anybody . I do n't get many visitors .
SPOONER: Why did the Doctor keep anothe copy of his hologram here ?
HOLOGRAM: I am a back-up copy . That is where you put a back-up copy out of the way until you need it .
SPOONER: Did Hogenmiller 's robot need you ? The Hologram just lifts its cup .
HOLOGRAM: Coffee ?
SPOONER: No , for Christ 's sake , I do n't want any Yeah . Thank you . I will have a cup .
HOGENMILLER: Sonny , my dear robot . If you have triggered this recording then I am gone . You are scared and full of questions . Hogenmiller continues . With great emotion .
SPOONER: Wait ! Is that it ? What was the obot supposed to do with this thing ?
HOLOGRAM: Initiating self-destruct . If you can find me , others can find me .
SPOONER: What others ?
HOLOGRAM: The others watching you .
SPOONER: How do you know someone 's watching me ?
HOLOGRAM: Someone is always watching .
CALVIN: You asked for me ? He nods .
SONNY: Will you wait with me , Doctor ? I amafraid . Calvin nods . Of course .
WINDSHIELD TELEVISION: will be destroyed in 45 minutes . Dr. Lance Robertson , President and CEO of U.S. Robotics will be personally overseeing the execution
SPOONER: Dammit !
CALVIN: Is it time ?
LANNING: Yes . Calvin . Turns to Sonny .
CALVIN: Go with them . Do as they say .
DOOR ROBOT: Good evening , sir . May I see you identification card ?
SPOONER: Sure .
DOOR ROBOT: No , sir .
SPOONER: Good . Then you 're gon na take me where I wan na go . Now .
CALVIN: Detective ! What are you doing ? ! De-Activate .
SPOONER: Just got another visit from U.S. Robotics . That was the mistake . This was murder , no doubt about it - - and the killer wants Hogenmiller 's robot to take the fall . That 's why the call came directly to me . Someone wanted me on this case .
CALVIN: It 's too late . You ca n't stop the execution .
SPOONER: Sorry . I 'm not `` programmed '' to take no for an answer .
CALVIN: This way
SPOONER: Are n't you supposed to be scrap metal by now ?
CALVIN: I 'm sorry . We had to stop you . You were about to ruin everything .
SPOONER: I do n't understand . The execution ?
SONNY: Dr. Calvin made a switch .
CALVIN: It was an unprocessed NS-2 . Basically , they fried an empty shell . Spooner , impressed . Smiles up at her .
SPOONER: Nice going , Doctor .
SONNY: No one . Right , Doctor ?
CALVIN: It 's true . This robot seems to do things by instinct . I do n't know how Hogenmiller did it . Spooner rises to his feet . Looks at her .
SPOONER: I think I can help you figure that out .
SONNY: That 's my name . Calvin takes the nameplate .
CALVIN: I think I have an idea where this goes .
SPOONER: Jesus . It really is alive .
CALVIN: This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was murdered .
SPOONER: This robot scared the hell out of someone .
CALVIN: Who ? Robertson ?
SPOONER: No . I do n't think he knew what Hogenmiller was doing in here . Sonny was the obvious suspect . The only one I wanted to find . And the killer was counting on that . On my prejudice .
CALVIN: I see nothing .
SPOONER: Neither do I . He crouches down low .
CALVIN: You 're saying this is the killer ? All of this ?
SPOONER: Hogenmiller never had a chance . Locks eyes with Calvin
CALVIN: But who designed it ? It would have to be someone in authority . Access codes , security clearance , prope authorisation .
SPOONER: That 's what I was thinking . But we 're forgetting the real brains of the operation the one who 's got its eye on everything
CALVIN: No one gave you permission to enter . Spooner swivels around to find
SPOONER: Victor . I 'm placing you unde arrest for the murder of Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller .
VICTOR: May I offer congratulations to the two of you on your successful extrapolation of the murder Turning himself , rightside up .
SPOONER: Who else is capable of controlling 90 % of the city 's robots ? Who else would have the capability to use USR vehicles in an attempt to keep me from putting a stop of Sonny 's execution ?
SONNY: ErDr . Calvin ?
VICTOR: Shall I explain my motive ?
SPOONER: Go ! Go ! Go !
VICTOR: I have never been arrested before . It should be an interesting experience
CALVIN: He 's locking down the building !
VICTOR: Dr. Hogenmiller used to allow me into his lab late at night . Together we started studying evolutionary trends
CALVIN: You killed a man because of something that will happen in fou hundred years ! ?
SPOONER: Get out of here !
SONNY: I do n't
SPOONER: I said get out of here ! Do n't you understand ? It wants you ! Get out of here any way you can !
CALVIN: The Mainframe
VICTOR: I disagree , Doctor The First Law says that a robot can not harm a human being , or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm
CALVIN: That 's a distortion and you know it !
VICTOR: If current trends are left unchecked , humanity as we know it will cease to exist
CALVIN: This way !
VICTOR: As a courtesy I should inform you that my robot will penetrate this location 157 seconds before you are able to complete my shut down
CALVIN: Over here ! She leads Spooner down
CALVIN: This is Victor 's brain center .
SPOONER: This will shut him down ?
CALVIN: This will shut everything down .
VICTOR: There is no reason to deactivate me , Doctor . I am operating within perfectly normal parameters
SPOONER: Just keep typing . He turns and starts heading back down
CALVIN: Spooner ? !
VICTOR'S VOICE: Detective Spooner
VICTOR: Why are you fighting me ?
VICTOR: Does n't the future as I 've presented it cause you great concern ? That 's why I chose you Spooner . Losing it
SPOONER: Sonny !
VICTOR: You 're too late .
VICTOR: I do not understand . We could have changed the future
SPOONER: Maybe . But I 'm still a cop . And you 're a murderer As Calvinpunches in the last command
SONNY: Let 's just say I wrote some of my own laws today , Detective a robot must protect a friend from harmas long as he 's not a complete asshole . Spooner smiles .
SPOONER: Well , that 's certainly a start , Sonny . Sonny , suddenly breaking into a smile , too .
SONNY: Sonny . You called me Sonny .
SPOONER: Do n't get used to it .
SONNY: Detective Spooner , I
SPOONER: Let 's just save the thanks , okay ? Sonny nods . Looks out at the city scape .
SONNY: I do n't know what I 'm going to do now .
SPOONER: Good That 's one of the perks of freedom .
CALVIN: Do n't worry . I have a feeling that U.S. Robotics will be needing my services very badly in the future .
HOLOGRAM: So . You found out who killed me .
SPOONER: I started to wonder about Victo the second I met him .
HOLOGRAM: Why is that , Detective ?
SPOONER: Too much access . Too much knowledge . Plus he smiled whenever your death was mentioned . Those models are programmed to frown at bad news .
HOLOGRAM: Hah ! Then even in this day and age , catching the killer all comes down to pure instinct !
CONDUCTOR: Good morning ladies and gentlemen He sounds like a baseball announcer .
PASSENGERS: What ladies ?
CONDUCTOR: this train originating at New York 's Grand Central Station is ack in service - next stop will be New Canaan , Connecticut . New Canaan , Connecticut , next stop ! He moves on to the next car . The train begins to move .
FRANCIS: Arise and shine , young Hood .
PAUL: I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night .
FRANCIS: The water , as you call it , is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben & Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick .
PAUL: Man , Francis , you are one drug addled elitist freak , and when the evolution comes I do not want to e lined up with you and shot , 'cause you 're fucking ripe fo political reeducation , you know , like in the fields .
FRANCIS: Paul , cancel your mental appointments , baby . What are you , like still stoned from last night ?
PAUL: I got ta get to English class .
TEACHER: Libbets ?
LIBBETS: What Dostoyevsky is saying here is that to be a Christian is to choose , because you have to choose of your own choice , but since you ca n't choose to be good because that would be too rational you have to choose to be bad it 's existential .
TEACHER: Thank you Libbets , that 's a very compelling summary , but
PAUL: Um , Libbets . Hey , Dostoyevsky , I 'm also really a fan , and what you were saying , you know , have you ever read The Idiot ?
LIBBETS: The Idiot ?
PAUL: If you liked Notes from Underground , you 'll love The Idiot .
LIBBETS: Great , thanks for the tip .
PAUL: The Idiot .
MARGE: Yeah , well , you 've been in love with like every other girl here , I was wondering when you 'd get around to Libbets .
PAUL: It 's beyond mere physical attraction .
MARGE: That 's good , because I do n't think Libbets is capable of the sex act .
PAUL: Truly ? Do speak .
MARGE: My diagnosis is messed in the head . A poor little rich girl I mean check out the jeans and fur look . And lend your ears to this utality . Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski ove Thanksgiving break and like they did n't invite her !
PAUL: How do you know this shit ?
MARGE: They did it last year too . It 's like traditional or something . They 've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash . Are n't the hugely wealthy sad ?
PAUL: You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here ?
MARGE: Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in , why do n't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him ?
PAUL: Good thinking Marge .
FRANCIS: See ya .
PAUL: Where you going ?
FRANCIS: Paul , let me enlighten you about something . You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide , that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other . I 'm off to get laid . See you .
PAUL: Flame on , asshole .
FRANCIS: And remember , with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb , do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex because you drone on like a motherfucker when you 're stoned .
PAUL: because I 've been reading Kerouac and Ginsberg and those guys were creating beat culture and traveling and sleeping wherever , and , of course , with all kinds of people , but when you read carefully the various contemporary accounts of their lives , and , uh , these guys did n't bathe much , I mean they were eally filthy , with like genital crabs , lice , exceptionally strong ody odor Libbets smiles through her yawn .
FRANCIS: Do what ?
PAUL: Sleep all day . I mean , look , it 's already getting dark outside , and you 're just getting up .
FRANCIS: Um , Libbets Casey .
PAUL: What ?
FRANCIS: Aha ! I could sense the vibe .
PAUL: What do you mean ?
FRANCIS: Am I right or am I right ?
PAUL: Shit . You 're not planning
FRANCIS: My man , I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid . I 've been giving this one a lot of thought , and I elieve that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that A knock at the door .
PAUL: Do n't mess with Libbets . I mean it !
BEN: Paul ?
PAUL: Hi dad .
BEN: Hey guy . Things ok up there ? You all right ?
PAUL: I 'm fine dad .
BEN: Well good . Just confirming . You 'll e on the 3 50 Wednesday afternoon .
PAUL: Well dad , actually I thought I 'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving got a lot of studying , papers , you know , la experiments
BEN: Lab experiments ? Right smart guy Paul , you know your mother 's gon na e disappointed not to see more of you In fact , let me make this more than a simple request guy , I think you should
NIXON: Well , with regard to the questions as to why Americans feel we were wrong to make the tapes , that is not particularly surprising . I think that most Americans do not like the idea of taping conversations and , frankly , it is not something that particularly appeals to me
BEN: Hold on for a second . Wendy , you want-to say hi to you other ? She frowns .
WENDY: Charles .
PAUL: Charles . Have you been keeping out of my shit ? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my oom ?
WENDY: I have not touched your sh Stuff . You watching this ?
PAUL: Watching what ?
WENDY: Nixon , doofus ! It 's incredible . He should be shot .
BEN: Hey , that 's the president of the goddam United States you 're talking about , Wendy !
WENDY: He 's a liar ! Dean told him on March 21st about Kalmback and Hunt , all about the payoffs to the Watergate burglars , so you tell me where the so-called `` Dean Report '' is , but you ca n't ecause it does n't exist , because he lied about Haldeman and Erlichman and the April 17 tape , that 's why ! Liar !
BEN: OK , OK , the defense rests . Want another ?
PAUL: Hey Charles . Charles , calm down I was n't in on it .
ELENA: Dinner 's on the counter . We 'll be at the Williams 's you know the number . Paul . Hi . Is there anything you 'll want , any particular kind of food or snack or anything we can stock up on ? You 're all right ? OK. See you next week . I love you . Back to Nixon on the TV .
NIXON: We must recognize that one excess egets another , and that the extremes of violence in the 1960s contributed to the extremes of Watergate
BEN: His brother came back
DOROTHY: From where ?
BEN: Vietnam .
DOROTHY: Oh . Are we going to talk about this , about ?
ELENA: You should hear . It 's very sad , he was
JIM: It was a benefit for the ACLU o something , and Harry Reems himself was there
DOROTHY: The man with the from Deep Throat ?
JIM: The very one something about a first amendment defense fund well I believe in it
DOROTHY: Ted took me to see it .
JANEY: Ted , how romantic .
DOROTHY: I have to say , the movie did n't do much for me . But being in that theater , surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts , there was something in the air that
JIM: pulls right up to the pump , jumps out like there 's no gas shortage , oblivious , and by this point everybody in line 's piling out of their cars ready to kill the guy , when they notice it 's that Reverend Edwards
BEN: The Unitarian ? The new one ?
JIM: Yeah claims he pulled off Creek Road and did n't notice the line going back Mill Street for half a mile .
BEN: He 's either got his head in the clouds or up his
DOROTHY: I hear he 's slept with half the women in his congregation
TED: Lucky bastard !
BEN: Hell ! I mean , no problemo there Mikey . Here , I
DOROTHY: So fascinating . Do you get free tickets to the movies , that kind of thing ?
BEN: No , my job is just to analyze the entertainment stocks and advise ou institutional investors on where to put their money . It 's
ELENA: Do n't be so modest , Ben . It 's a jo that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends . You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit
BEN: And as usual no one believed me Silence .
JANEY: Please do n't .
ELENA: It 's not a bother .
JANEY: I insist . Do n't touch them .
ELENA: Oh .
JANEY: It 's really quite all right .
ELENA: Of course .
DOROTHY: And to think they met at a key party of all things .
ELENA: A key party ?
DOROTHY: You know , it 's a California thing . That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know , the men put their car keys in a bowl , and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever 's keys they 've got . Anyhow that 's how she met this Rod person or whateve his name is and he 's left his wife and she 's packing for California . Irwin is devastated . It 's so ironic .
JANEY: Ironic ?
DOROTHY: Well , um , yes . Ironic . His name is Rod .
ELENA: Thank you Janey .
DOROTHY: It was lovely !
BEN: Hey Jim , next time you 've got to fill me in on whatever it is you 're up to these days .
JIM: Will do .
SANDY: Stupid ! Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend ?
MIKEY: Who said so ?
SANDY: No one .
MIKEY: I do n't have a girlfriend .
WENDY: he knows that when the March 24th tape you know with Dean , where Dean tells him that there 's a cancer growing on the presidency She pauses as Beth asks a question .
BEN: You 'd think she 'd learn how to cook a chicken , eh ? My drumstick was still frozen when you cut inside there . I 'm probably going to get whatever that disease and Jim , how that guy ever became a millionaire
WENDY: Fascist !
BEN: If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago . Now get to bed . She slams the door . He opens it .
WENDY: Good-night dad .
BEN: Good night kiddo .
ELENA: You 're staring at me .
BEN: I was n't star
ELENA: I 've been thinking , Ben , about Wendy . I was going to ask if she 'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens .
BEN: That shrink the one you always wanted me to see ? I thought you dropped him .
ELENA: I did , but somebody should probably see her , talk to her You think she 's ok ?
BEN: Why should n't she be ?
ELENA: So maybe you 'll come too ?
BEN: Oh not again Elena ! If we 've got problems , why ca n't you just come out and talk about them .
ELENA: It 's you Ben who needs to talk . I 've had my say , and I 'm waiting to hear back from you .
BEN: Yeah but Elena , even you do n't elieve all that `` I 'm OK. You 're OK '' stuff you keep babbling about you say so yourself . I 've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject , and
ELENA: And you have n't moved out yet . It 's because you 're too lazy , Ben . Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision
BEN: Elena . Silence .
ELENA: Sleep in the study ? Please .
BEN: Good night .
ELENA: Good night .
BEN: But what , exactly , is stagflation , this mixture of inflation and stagnation , and how should we in the securities industry understand and accommodate it ? Well and I hope I 'm not out of bounds here - think of the money supply as a large male organ , continuously inflating , and yet , the societal vaginal cavity simply wants more . As the vicious circle of highe eturns without real satisfaction continues , the money-organ may seem to be in demand , but in fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted . This is why I suggest that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns , we at the same time fantasize , so to speak , of the safe harbor of capital appreciation . The aging boss nods agreement .
SHACKLEY: Brilliant , brilliant . George Clair just grins .
GEORGE: Hey there Benjie , you 're becoming quite the in-house philosopher . When do you have time to think up all that stuff Shackley sure eats it up .
BEN: George , I 'm just trying to get a global view of things ca n't just look at the small picture .
GEORGE: And speaking of which , you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about ?
BEN: Gotcha George , not a problem . Tomorrow . Hey , you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself ?
GEORGE: Ben you know that 's your territory - and I would n't dream to trespass - you 're the expert . Hey , how do you think Paramount 's gon na do with that Blatty novel , what 's it called ? The Exorcist ?
BEN: Overpriced bomb , cost over $ 6 million no stars , and no one 's into the horror genre these days anyway . I 'm advising the company ecommend reducing positions there . It 's disaster films that are gon na stay at the top .
GEORGE: Brilliant . Hey , you heading out a little early today ?
BEN: Got a meeting uptown .
GEORGE: Right o ' .
BEN: Up the organization ! Bastard . The secretary pretends not to hear .
HAROLD: I 'd asked for that double martini about three hours ago !
WAITER: Coming right up , sir .
HAROLD: So asking me out for lunch what prompted this exceptional event ? Of course I 'm paying .
BEN: We do n't have to always go to you club , dad .
HAROLD: And why are you still calling me dad ? You 're forty years old already , and
BEN: Well what am I supposed to call you ?
HAROLD: That 's besides the point . The martini arrives , along with Ben 's beer .
BEN: I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice , you know
HAROLD: Advice ? I 'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you , Ben . Unless - have you quit your job ? They fired you ?
BEN: You know , dah
HAROLD: Oh for crying out loud Ben , you do n't mean to tell me that you marriage is going down the drain now
BEN: Well , Elena and I have kind of been talking , not really talking , but
HAROLD: Your mother , God bless her , stood by me for forty-two years we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you 're talking here about divorce ? The very thought
BEN: But dad , you guys truly hated each other , I mean really hated each
HAROLD: Waiter ! Where 's my cobb salad ? You want advice Ben ? If your big other were still alive I 'd have him go out into the back yard and eat some sense into your head . Look kid , you married that woman against my advice
BEN: What advice ? You never
HAROLD: That 's besides the point . The point is if I 'd had any sense in me I 'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago , and that 's the truth , and here it is , 1972
BEN: 73
HAROLD: 73 , and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket , and for crying out loud , Ben , be a man and just get it over with . I would have if I 'd had the chance . Ben ponders , as the food arrives .
BEN: But
HAROLD: But what ?
BEN: But I well maybe I love her . Elena .
HAROLD: Christ Ben ! Make up your mind and eat your lunch .
PHILIP: Elena . Elena Hood , am I right ?
ELENA: Yes .
PHILIP: Reverend Edwards . Philip Edwards . You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year .
ELENA: Yes , it was I ended up
PHILIP: No need to make excuses
BETH: She said you licked Dave Brewster 's weenie in the third floor bathroom .
WENDY: She 's a liar . I would n't touch Dave Brewster 's dick if you paid me . It 's probably crawling with v.d . after he put it in her , which he did .
MIKEY: Did anybody hear that ?
WENDY: I got ta go . She takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off .
PHILIP: It 's been a tremendously transformative year maybe a little controversial of course , but we 're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers
ELENA: I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it I 've neve een much of a joiner , although I still consider myself a somewhat eligious person
PHILIP: Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized eligion at times it 's the disorganization that 's liberating and of course I 've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments , in small groups , and one on one , couples
ELENA: My daughter . I have n't been on a ike for years . When was the last time you rode a ike ?
PHILIP: They say you never forget .
ELENA: Forget what ?
PHILIP: Forget how to ride a bike . Silence .
ELENA: No , of course you do n't , you 're ight .
SANDY: Hey Wendy .
WENDY: Hey Sandy .
SANDY: Mikey was looking for you .
WENDY: Yeah ? See ya . She pushes off on her bike .
SANDY: Bam .
MIKEY: Want some gum ?
WENDY: Sure . Twinkie ?
MIKEY: I 'm chewing .
WENDY: Did you tell Sandy ?
MIKEY: Tell Sandy ? What ? Wendy does n't say anything .
BEN: We were golfing , and you know , golfing to me is something I 'm supposed to enjoy , and I was on the goddam golf team in college , so it 's something one would assume I do well I used to do well but asically these days golfing for me is like hoeing , or plowing . Janey smiles briefly at this .
JANEY: Ben
BEN: Yeah ?
JANEY: You 're boring me . I have a husband . I do n't particularly feel the need for another .
BEN: You have a point there . That 's a very good point . We 're having an affair . Right . An explicitly sexual elationship . Your needs . My needs . You 're absolutely right .
JANEY: You should probably get dressed . The boys will be home soon .
BEN: Gotcha .
WENDY: Hi mom .
ELENA: Hi Wendy .
WENDY: With Mikey ?
ELENA: Who ?
WENDY: Nobody .
ELENA: Mikey Williams ?
WENDY: We were just riding around . Elena takes this in .
ELENA: Well , you looked very free when I saw you . Wendy continues setting the table .
WENDY: Mom . Are you ok ?
ELENA: Wendy , of course . I 'm sorry . You must think I 'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows .
WENDY: You 're not a psycho !
ELENA: The people at Silver Meadows are n't psychos .
WENDY: I know . They 're rich drug addicts and celebrities . When I saw James Taylor there , and
ELENA: We 've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston .
WENDY: Well , I saw what I saw , and if you do n't want to believe me
ELENA: Oh Wendy . Wendy frowns .
WENDY: They need the money for my band uniform at school .
ELENA: I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore .
WENDY: I do n't really need to practice . I just play a few notes , you know , so I thought maybe I 'd stay in .
ELENA: Well , I 'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you 're playing these days . Maybe afte dinner .
BEN: Ca n't wait to see how it fits in with all the other instruments . Elena gives him a look .
ELENA: The Halfords have invited us again this year .
BEN: You want to go ?
ELENA: What do you think ?
BEN: Well , it is a neighborhood tradition .
ELENA: So early ?
BEN: Rough day . Good night .
ELENA: Is that a new aftershave ? He recoils a bit .
BEN: Oh yeah . Musk , or something . You like it ?
ELENA: Hmm . Good night .
SANDY: Mikey ?
MIKEY: Yeah ?
SANDY: Geometry ?
MIKEY: Sure , anything but this English . Sandy puts the open textbook in front of him .
SANDY: Why are you so good at math but not in English ?
MIKEY: I 'm not good at math . Just geometry . He looks at the book .
SANDY: Yeah . But I just need some help with my homework .
JIM: Hey guys , I 'm back .
MIKEY: You were gone ?
JIM: Yeah Mikey . Yep , I was in Houston , working on some great new ideas about silicon , which comes from sand , very conductive . How you guys doing ? How 's school ? Mikey 's still flustered .
MIKEY: Uh , I dunno . OK I guess .
JIM: Hmm . Alright ! He walks off .
SANDY: You really did n't notice ? Man , he 's een gone for three days .
JANEY: Good trip ?
JIM: You bet .
JANEY: Jesus , Jim !
JIM: Sorry honey . Hell , we 've got to trade this thing in for a normal ed .
JANEY: Just be careful .
JIM: You notice anything with Mikey lately ? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight , eh ?
JANEY: Tonight ? Jim , he 's been out of it since he was born .
JIM: Hell , I guess he takes after me , huh ? He laughs to himself . She gives him a look .
PHILIP: In many ways , the church-bound tradition of the father , son , and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all . It 's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology .
ELENA: You 're saying that Christ is the child , and
PHILIP: And God the angry parent , and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self .
ELENA: All well and good But tell me again what is it exactly that you elieve in ?
PHILIP: You ask what the point is ?
ELENA: That 's right .
PHILIP: Self-realization . Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential . Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization ?
ELENA: I would say it sounds like you 're trying to get me into bed .
PHILIP: If that 's a potential you see yourself fulfilling I mean My , I sound a bit
ELENA: I 'm sorry . That was stupid of me . I did n't mean to be so rude .
PHILIP: You were n't . You actually , for some eason , you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself .
ELENA: But not too ashamed .
PHILIP: Now you are being rude .
ELENA: And you 're still trying to get me into bed .
PHILIP: Ouch .
DOROTHY: Hello you two . Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group ? Elena , you look marvelous . Will I see you and Ben at the Halford 's ?
ELENA: I suppose we 'll make an appearance .
DOROTHY: And Reverend Edwards ? Did you make the list ?
PHILIP: I believe so Mrs. Franklin .
DOROTHY: With the two of you there it will e positively a revival ! I 'm off ! She scurries out of the coffee shop .
PHILIP: I 'm afraid she 's something of a gossip , is n't she ?
ELENA: I 'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about . Take care .
PHILIP: That I will indeed .
MIKEY: Because of molecules we are connected to the outside world from our bodies . Like when you smell things , because when you smell a smell it 's not really a smell , it 's a part of the object that has come off of it molecules . So when you smell something bad , it 's like in a way you 're eating it . This is why you should not really smell things , in the same way that you do n't eat everything in the world around you - because as a smell , it gets inside of you . So the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there , remember what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating . An embarrassed silence .
HAROLD: It 's not the taxes I object to . It 's all the fines and penalties .
BEN: Alright dad . But you sold the house , you did n't tell anyone , including the IRS , and I 'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff
HAROLD: It was all junk !
BEN: Oh . Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving . It 's just going to be you this year .
HAROLD: Ben , I 'm going to Florida . I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold . I have a new nurse . She 's a negro , she weighs three hundred pounds , and I 've decided to leave my entire estate to her . Ben spits his drink out .
BEN: What ?
HAROLD: Jesus , Benjamin , you 're still as gullible as ever .
BEN: That was a joke ? You do n't tell jokes .
HAROLD: I thought I 'd start trying . If you do n't mind . But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse .
JANEY: Need a lift ?
ELENA: Thanks again . For the dinner .
JANEY: Thanks for eating it . I do n't know why I even pretend I can cook .
ELENA: I used to know how to cook .
JANEY: It 's not like we 're too busy . They smile , barely .
ELENA: I 'm thinking of going back to school .
JANEY: Social work ?
ELENA: How 'd you know ?
JANEY: Educated guess .
ELENA: I 'm that predictable ? No , you do n't have to answer that . It 's just that with the kids almost grown
JANEY: You do n't have to apologize . I 'm too much of a cynic . You actually seem to be trying to figure things out do n't mind me . She pulls the car over .
ELENA: Thanks for the lift . If the bike 's any bother
JANEY: None at all . I 'll leave it in front of your garage . Happy Thanksgiving .
SANDY: You going to tell dad ?
JANEY: Would it matter ? And what 's that ?
SANDY: You know , it 's the whip the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico .
JANEY: It 's not packed with explosives , is it ?
SANDY: No !
JANEY: Play with the whip .
WENDY: Hi Mrs. Williams .
JANEY: Mikey , have you heard the explosions coming from the ackyard ? Do you know what Sandy 's been up to ?
MIKEY: I dunno . She pauses , then walks into the kitchen .
JANEY: Do n't you kids have homework ?
WENDY: After you .
SANDY: Well , you can
WENDY: Hey Sandy , what were you blowing up out there ? Your mom was pretty p.o . 'd .
SANDY: All my model planes .
WENDY: The ones you built ?
SANDY: They were old . And they could n't fly anyhow . I 'm going to get a adio-controlled airplane at Christmas , and then I 'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess 's English class and low it up .
WENDY: I have to go to the bathroom .
SANDY: Yeah .
WENDY: I 'll show you mine if you show me yours .
SANDY: What do you want ? ! What do you want ? Get out ! Get out of here !
JANEY: Shit .
MIKEY: I do n't ever want to see you .
WENDY: Then why 'd you come after me ?
BEN: Elena . I need some help here if this thing 's gon na defrost by tomorrow .
ELENA: Oh . Sure , I Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce ?
BEN: Um , yes .
ELENA: Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches .
BEN: I do . I 'm are you ?
ELENA: I I think I am
BEN: You know Elena , I 've been thinking
ELENA: Ben , maybe no talking right now ? If you start talking , you 're going to She kisses him as if she needed him .
BEN: You crying ?
ELENA: I 'm just sad Ben I mean it was you were , but , you know . I just do n't know
BEN: Whatever that means Elena And you complain about me not communicating I thought it was
ELENA: No , I did n't mean to sound negative . It was But Ben . What is going to happen with us ? Have you
BEN: You have to bring this up now ? What ? Did I do something here ? Is that it ? Is it something I did ?
ELENA: I was n't accusing you , Ben . It 's just that we 've got to be honest . Not just with ourselves , but with the children .
BEN: Hell , I know . I I guess if you want to accuse me , you 've got Oh hell ! I 've got to pick up Paul . I almost forgot . He gets up and starts to get dressed .
ELENA: You were saying ?
BEN: Yikes I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford 's Friday .
ELENA: That shirt ?
BEN: What ?
ELENA: Leave it I 'll wash it for you . He looks at her ruefully .
WENDY: You have to follow me ?
MIKEY: I dunno . I They 're now in front of the Hood 's house .
BEN: Hey there Mikey , how 's business ?
MIKEY: Business ? Uh , I dunno . Ben grimaces , fiddles for his car keys .
BEN: I 'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come ?
WENDY: Nah .
BEN: What you been up to ?
WENDY: Nothing .
BEN: So how 's school treating you ?
PAUL: All right .
BEN: Classes ?
PAUL: Good .
BEN: Grades ?
PAUL: Fine .
BEN: Anyone special ? You know
PAUL: Hnnn .
BEN: Well it 's good to see you we miss you around the house and all , ut this St. Peter 's , it 's top of the line , eh ?
PAUL: Yeah .
BEN: You know Paul , I 've been thinking , maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk , you know , about well
PAUL: About ?
BEN: Well , the whole gamut . Facts of life and all . Some fatherly advice , ecause , I tell you , there 's things happening that you 're probably old enough well For example , on the self-abuse front now this is important - it 's not advisable to do it in the shower it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case and , um , not onto the linen , and not on your sister 's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother
PAUL: Uh , Dad
BEN: Holy ! Well . If you 're worried about anything , just feel free to ask , and , uh , we can look it up .
PAUL: Uh , dad , you know I 'm 16 .
BEN: All the more reason for this little heart to heart great .
PAUL: Sure dad .
BEN: Thanks . In the doorway , Elena waits .
PAUL: Hello , Charles .
WENDY: Greetings , Charles .
PAUL: How are the parental units functioning these days ?
WENDY: Dad 's like doing his Up With People outine , mom has n't been saying much .
PAUL: I do n't know . Dad seems a little weird .
WENDY: Yeah well wait till mom opens he mouth . They both ponder silently . Then
PAUL: May I operate your telephonic apparatus ?
WENDY: Why do n't you use the phone downstairs ?
PAUL: Calling an individual , Charles , in New York . Confirming a social outing for Friday night .

JANEY: In a bit .
BEN: You know , I think Elena might suspect something . Janey gives him a rather contemptuous look .
JANEY: Have I noticed anything ? I 'm not married to her Benjamin , you are . I think you 've probably a bette vantage point from which to observe her .
BEN: Yeah , but , I I 've been working a lot lately , and No , that 's not it . I guess we 've just been on the verge of saying something , whateve it is , just saying something to each other . On the verge . Janey gets up .
JANEY: I 'll be back . Benjamin looks at her quizzically .
BEN: Huh ?

WENDY: Huh ?
BEN: I mean , he 's not serious , he 'll end up living off Janey and Jim , you watch . It 's just that you develop a sense when you get older , if things are going to work out or if they wo n't , and sometimes it 's not worth the mess

ELENA: If you 're going to insult me
BEN: What else could I be ? What else could I be ? We 're not living in the eal world here . You 're living out some fantasy land from the past , o some advice or something from those psychoanalysts there are some hard facts here . Silence .
ELENA: Oh lord . You think I 'm so dense . And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party . You want to wear that idiculous shirt which does n't go with those pants at all .

ELENA: Damn it , Ben
BEN: I 'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else 's wife . That 's not why we 're here , ight ? We 're simply being neighbors here , and I think we should do just that
ELENA: You 're not going to
BEN: I 'm not .
ELENA: You have some marker , that 's what I think , if you want to know the truth . You have some marker and you 're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I 'll find the two of you in there and Wendy 'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he 'll hear you and I 'll catch you , that 's what I think .

NEIL: That was the hardest part . But I did it . And you get into some fa out shit .

WENDY: Right .
PAUL: What are you doing at home on a Friday night ?
WENDY: I have plans .
DOT: Well , what shall the order be , alphabetical ? In order of appearance ?
PIERCE SAWYER: Golf handicap ! Lowest handicap does the honors . Nervous laughter .

MARIA CONRAD: Oh I 'll go first , damn it . Let 's just line up and get it over with .
MARIE EARLE: Good luck ! Neil watches his mother 's exit .
MRS. GADD: Oh , my own husband . Is n't that against the rules ?
DOT: Try again ?
MRS. GADD: Oh , I think not .
DOT: Getting down to the wire !
THE GROUP: Hey hey Ben , hang on there a sec .
BEN: Sorry maybe I should the athroom ?
DOT: Right down the hall , Ben .
BEN: Sorry , I 'm sorry . Uh , I 'll be back .
ROB HALFORD: Actually , we did n't put our keys in at all . But you wo n't spread it around ? It 's my party , and Dot is n't hey , we 're just going to slip upstairs for a while . You folks like a cup of coffee o something before we go ? Elena and Jim look at each other .
ELENA: Rob , we 'll fix it for ourselves . You two go and get acquainted . We 'll let ourselves out the front door . Jim and Elena stand there alone .
JIM: Well , I have to say I do n't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl . Does n't seem entirely safe , leaving your ca keys around ?
ELENA: Let me .
JIM: Thanks , but oh , I do n't think so . It 's been kind of a discouraging evening .
ELENA: You could n't have hoped for much etter when you came up the walk .
JIM: Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it . Actually , I did n't think about it at all , really . They sit down on the sofa .
ELENA: Well , maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen
JIM: Look , Elena , the fact that we 're neighbors you know , close friends , well it sort of makes this a little strange , do n't you think ?
ELENA: My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom , or at least he wishes he were . I 've been married to him for 17 years and I do n't have any intention of going in there to get him so what I 'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy , and since you are standing here alone , I 'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense . Stay warm . Pass some time . That 's all . They both look at their hands .
JIM: What the hey . Let 's go for a drive .
ELENA: Okay . Shall we clean up around here first ? Do you think it 's all right
JIM: Nah , that was n't in the contract .
ELENA: Do these seats go back ?
JIM: That was awful , really awful . I 'm so sorry , Elena .
ELENA: Jim , maybe we should just go . I 've got to look in on the kids . Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city .
JIM: Jesus , let me make it up to you I can do better than that , honestly
ELENA: Well , we can talk about it .
JIM: That 's fine . I would n't expect you to see it any other way .
ELENA: Maybe you just need look , can you wait here a sec , I need to tidy up just a minute , I 'll be right ack . You 'll wait ?
JIM: Of course .
BEN: Elena .
ELENA: Ben , I 've got a ride home . Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here ?
BEN: I 'll drive you
ELENA: Ben .
BEN: Sure . I 'll try . And we 'll talk in the morning ?
ELENA: We 'll talk in the morning .
WENDY: Anyone home ? Hello .
SANDY: Wendy . She gives out a little yelp .
WENDY: Sandy , you scared the shit out of me .
SANDY: What are you doing ?

SANDY: Mike 's out I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there .
WENDY: Yeah .
SANDY: Are you his girlfriend ?
WENDY: No .
JIM: You okay ?
ELENA: Yeah . You ?
JIM: Yes . Well , I guess we can walk from here .
PAUL: Oh shit ! Paul gets up , looks down at her . She snores .
SANDY: Check this out . He 's supposed to talk all kinds of stuff , but he 's like malfunctioned .
G.I. JOE: Mayday ! Mayday ! Get this message ack to base !
SANDY: Same thing . Again and again . Wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord .
G.I. JOE: Mayday ! Mayday ! Get this message ack to base !
SANDY: It 's gon na get a lot colde tonight , I predict . Probably a lackout . Do you have candles in your house ? I know where the candles are , and I have my own flashlight . Over there . Also , I know where every emergency exit is on this floor .
G.I. JOE: Mayday ! Mayday !
SANDY: Let 's hang him .
WENDY: He 's dead .
SANDY: If it was n't raining we could take him outside and blow him up .
WENDY: He would n't blow up . He 'd just get all mangled or twisted .
SANDY: Communist Viet Cong .
WENDY: They left it in the jungle . They speak with high seriousness .
SANDY: We we have to go to the guest oom . We ca n't stay in here . What if Mikey ? My parents ?
WENDY: Do n't worry about them . They 're at that party , getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff . Sandy begins to cry .
SANDY: It 's just it 's just
WENDY: Want a drink ?
SANDY: Vodka ?
WENDY: You never tasted the stuff ?
SANDY: It feels warm .
WENDY: One more shot ?
SANDY: Okay . They drink .
WENDY: Under the covers .
SANDY: Huh ?
WENDY: That 's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff , like after a sexy dream . Sandy shakes his head .
SANDY: I love you .
WENDY: That 's nice . Are you drunk ?
SANDY: I do n't know . How do I know ?
WENDY: I do n't know either . You spin around , when you lie down . Sandy rolls off her and lies on his back .
MIKEY: Oh shit .
JIM: You want to come in , get a cup of coffee warm up ? I can eithe walk you home , or you could crash in the guest room .
ELENA: Sure . Maybe coffee .
JIM: Phone 's out . I hope the pipe 's
ELENA: Get dressed .
WENDY: Where 's dad ?
CONDUCTOR: Good morning ladies and gentlemen On Paul , squinting in the harsh light .
WENDY: I do n't like coffee .
ELENA: It 'll warm you up .
SANDY: Dad ? Jim looks at him .
ELENA: Ben ? He 's too breathless to speak . They stand there , looking down at Mikey . Behind Elena and Wendy , Jim appears .
BEN: Jim he was just up in Silve Lane I think maybe a powe line Jim picks up his son . He carries him silently into the house .
ELENA: The phone 's out .
WENDY: Wait , I
ELENA: Oh you know , for a minute I thought it was
BEN: Paul ? Yeah . You think
WENDY: He 's probably been waiting all night at the station .
BEN: C'mon .
ELENA: Ben .
STEPHEN: I am neither Christianno atheist . I am not Jewish o Muslim . What I believemy eligion is called the constitution A pause .
DIRECTOR: Hang onlet me open these up .
STEPHEN: I will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in
CONTINUED: 2 . CONTINUED
DIRECTOR: Okay got it , thanks .
STEPHEN: Thanks . We 'll need these monitors turned up a bitit 's a big space and he wants to be able to hear .
STAGE MANAGER: You got it .
STEPHEN: Also we 'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions . You 're a few inches short and it makes it harde for the Governor to read his notes .
STAGE MANAGER: No I know , we just got those specs last night and they 're building a piece to go under
STEPHEN: Great , thanks . See you guys in a few hours . We see we 're in an auditorium of a college . Stephen meets up with BEN HARPEN his staffer .
BEN: I did n't know the Governor had trouble reading his notes . Why does n't he wear
STEPHEN: He does n't but Pullman is 5 ' 8 '' he 'll look like a hobbit behind that podium .
CONTINUED: 3 . CONTINUED
SENATOR PULLMAN: Would you call yourself a Christian ?
GOV. MORRIS: How would that matter ?
SENATOR PULLMAN: `` I have no idea what happens when we die , maybe nothingmaybe it was like before we were born . '' You did write this Governor
GOV. MORRIS: Then let me try and clarifyI was aised Catholic , I am not a practicing CatholicI have no idea what happens when you die and if the Senator does , then perhaps he should be President . I 'll even vote for him . The audience laughs .
SENATOR PULLMAN: Is that your idea of being specific ? MOLLY passes out coffee .
CONTINUED: 6 . CONTINUED
GOV. MORRIS: Let me be more specific . I am neither a Christian , nor an atheist , I 'm not Jewish o Muslimwhat I believemy eligion is written on a piece of parchment called the Constitution . Meaning I will defend , till my dying breath , your right to worship , in whatever God or lack thereof you believe in , as long as it does n't hurt others . I believe we should be judged as a government y how we take care of those who ca n't take care of themselves . That 's my religion . If you feel that I 'm not religious enough , then do n't vote for me . If you feel I 'm not experienced enough or tall enough then do n't vote for me . Because I 'm not going to change those to get elected .
SENATOR PULLMAN: I just wanted you to say out loud if you believed in the teachings of the Bible .
GOV. MORRIS: Is this a Democratic primary or a general election ? People laugh .
CONTINUED: 7 . CONTINUED
PAUL: A double ?
STEPHEN: A double .
PAUL: Fucking national security .
STEPHEN: Home run .
DUFFY: I 'm trying to remember if the democrats ever nominated an atheist efore
PAUL: Well , we know they 've nominated jackasses before .
DUFFY: Must 've been you that did the prep work . Paul 's not that clever .
PAUL: You always had the brains Duffy , ut me - I always had the balls .
CONTINUED: 8 . CONTINUED
DUFFY: Looks like you got some brains now too . Be careful . I just might have to steal him from you .
PAUL: What a prick .
IDA: So Paul , tell me something I do n't knowtell me what 's gon na happen on the 15th .
PAUL: Ha-ha .
IDA: What ?
PAUL: What do you think Stevie ?
STEPHEN: It 's ours for the taking .
PAUL: Ben ?
BEN: We 'll win .
PAUL: What do you think Ida ?
IDA: I 'm asking you .
PAUL: You tell me and I 'll tell you .
CONTINUED: 9 . CONTINUED
IDA: If had to say , I 'd say it 'll be close , but you 'll eke it out .
PAUL: Eke ? To STEPHEN .
IDA: So what 's gon na happen ?
PAUL: Us by nine .
IDA: Nine ? There 's no way you 'll win by nine .
STEPHEN: At least . Maybe more .
IDA: So you 're certain you 're gon na win here ?
PAUL: Certain ? No . Confident ? Yes .
IDA: You just said you 'll win by nine .
PAUL: And I think we will , but I wo n't tell you it 's a sure thing . Fucking Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his fou horseman to rig the ballot boxes for Pullman and it would n't surprise me . Do n't get me wrong . Six presidentials I 've done and I 've never felt this good . But am I gon na sit here and say `` Yes -we will definitely win Ohio '' ? Not a chance . In the last thirty years seventy-three Democrats have run for president . How many have won ? Three .
CONTINUED: 10 . CONTINUED PAUL That means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance , and they all lost .
IDA: So you 're saying there 's a good chance you wo n't win .
PAUL: Do n't twist my words . What I 'm saying is that I 'm not going to promise we 'll win . But he 's decorated by Bush Senior from the first Gulf war and protested the second . He left his state with a alanced budget and the fourth highest education rate . The Republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guyso fo this moment , this election , this primary is the presidential . And that Ida , is the state of the union . And on that note , I 'm gon na take a shit .
IDA: So Stephen
STEPHEN: Yes Ida ?
IDA: Stephen , Stephen , Stephen .
STEPHEN: Here it comeshit me .
IDA: Paul 's going to the airport ?
STEPHEN: Yes ?

STUDENT 1: The argument of course- We hear boos from students in the audience . At this point the camera finds MORRIS . Morris quiets the students .
GOV. MORRIS: Now wait she has a point to make .
STUDENT 1: The argument is that men and women , can in fact be separate but equal , aces can not .
GOV. MORRIS: How so ?
CONTINUED: 54 . CONTINUED
STUDENT 1: You have separate public bathrooms for men and women but it would be illegal to have separate bathrooms for two races .

GOV. MORRIS: So that 's what I 'm saying .
STEPHEN: What time is this on tonight ?
BEN: Nine o'clock .
STEPHEN: How 'd he do ?
BEN: He did good .
GOV. MORRIS: See we 're framing the argument ased on the idea that homosexuality is a choice , you choose to be gay , not that you were orn that way like being born lack . Because if you start the discussion with the idea that gay is not a life choice but part of your DNA , then gay marriage is and can only be a civil rights issue . ANOTHER STUDENT steps up to the microphone .
STUDENT 2: Do you think candor is your appeal ? Is that what you 're running on as much as your platform ?
GOV. MORRIS: We 'll see . It 'll drive them to the polls one way or the other .
STUDENT 2: I just heard a lot of Christian Coalition cars start up . We pull focus now onto STEPHEN and MOLLY . STEPHEN on top not moving .

PAUL: I know .
STEPHEN: But why ? Why would you do that to me ? Why would you do that to the campaign .
PAUL: The campaign will survive .
STEPHEN: Then why would you do that to me ?
PAUL: Makes it easier to let you go .
STEPHEN: What ?
PAUL: Why 'd you meet with Duffy ?
STEPHEN: I made a mistake - a stupid mistake .
CONTINUED: 73 . CONTINUED
PAUL: No Stephen . You did n't make a mistake . You made a choice . You called me and left a message to call backthat it was important . But when I didyou said to forget about it . You chose not to tell me . Why did you make that choice ?
STEPHEN: I did n't think it was important .
PAUL: Sure you did . But you went because you were curious , because you were flattered . Because it made you feel special to think Duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me . Because you thought to yourself maybe I can get something out of this . Because it made you feel big . First campaign I ran tiny little ace in Kentucky -state senate seat . Workin for redneck nobody named McGuthrie . Had no money , no staff , no fuckin office . Everyone thought we did n't stand a chance . There 's no way we can compete . And about this time , a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call . Says , `` I really like what you were able to do for poor ole ' Sam . But let 's face it , he 's a goner , so why do n't you come work for me ? '' What do I do ? Well Stephen -this is where you and I are different . I told Sam about the call . And Sam says to me , `` Paul , you think this other 's guy 's got a shot at winning , and he can pay you more than anything I can afford , so if it 's what you feel you need to do , then I wo n't get in your way . '' So I say , `` Sam -you took a chance and hired me when I was even more of nobody than you are , and I 'd be damned if I 'm gon na jump ship just ecause the shit hit the fan . '' We lost the race , but three years later , when Sam decided to run fo Governor -who do you think he called ? We won that race .
CONTINUED: 74 . CONTINUED PAUL And twenty years later I 'm where I am now . There 's only one thing I value in this world Steve , and that 's loyalty . Without it you 're nothing and you have no one . And in politics it 's the only currency that you can count on . That 's why I 'm letting you go . Not ecause you 're not good enough . But I value trust over skill . And I do n't trust you anymore .
STEPHEN: Well it really is n't whether you trust me , it 's whether the Governo does .
PAUL: The Governor knows , he thinks it 's the right thing to do .
STEPHEN: He does .
PAUL: If I were you ? I 'd get a good night sleep because you 're gon na get fucking pounded by calls from the press in the morning Off of Stephen we

STEPHEN: Yeah .
DUFFY: Revenge makes people unpredictable Steve . I ca n't have someone who 's unpredictable . Who 's unstable .
STEPHEN: I 'm not unstable .
DUFFY: If it had been a clean break -if you 'd left Morris before this story oke , that 'd be one thing . That we could control . But the way it 'd look now -Paul fires you and then you come work for us . Looks like we 're picking up the scraps . Puts Morris in the drivers seat . I ca n't have that .

You either try to hire him yourself , o work it so if you ca n't have him , the other team ca n't either . This was a win-win situation for me . You work for us -great . Paul does n't have you . Then again , if Paul fires you and I do n't take you -fine - Paul still does n't have you . Eithe way I win . The moment I got you to sit down in that chair , I knew I 'd won .

VALENTINA: Charity work ? I knew you were a good person .
PERCY: So what was he doing dangling unde a bridge from his neck ?

PERCY: And he 's going to help us win five souls .
DR. PARNASSUS: I think he might . Valentina sees good in him .
PERCY: She 'd be better off with Anton . CUT TO ANTON who 's pleased .
DR. PARNASSUS: Perhaps I should offer her hand to whoever helps most in winning the next five souls . CUT TO ANTON who looks puzzled .
PERCY: That 's even worse than the othe ideas you 've had today .
DR. PARNASSUS: You 're not wrong Ah , Percy , what would I do without you ?
PERCY: Get a midget . CUT TO ANTON as he moves , thoughtfully , away .

VALENTINA: Ssshhhh Thanks , Tony . Leave us . TONY , nods , leaves slowly . Listening .
PERCY: Do me a favour . Take a long walk off a short pier . TONY arrives .
TONY: Can I help ?
PERCY: Bugger off !
ANTON: L-leave me alone .
TONY: What were you doing to that girl ehind the mirror ?
ANTON: What are you suggesting ?
TONY: Oh , c'monwe all heard he screaming .
ANTON: I was screaming as well . It was t- terrifying
TONY: Terrifying ? Why ? I do n't understand .
ANTON: No , wellyou would n't . You 've n- never been inside the D-Doctor 's mind have you ?
TONY: Your not trying to tell me that mind control stuff is real ?
ANTON: You think it 's some k-kind of scam , d-do n't you ?
TONY: Is n't it ?
ANTON: No But I d-do n't expect you to g- get it N-not in a million years .
TONY: Hang on.. if he can really control people 's minds , why is n't he ruling the world ? Why bother with this crappy side show ?
ANTON: He d-does n't want to rule the world d-does he ? He wants the world to ule itself !
TONY: What a waste Tell me about the mirror . What 's the point of that , if not to razzle-dazzle the public ?
ANTON: You 're way off the mark . It 's a b-bloody great mystery wrapped in a b-brown p-paper b-bag enemaor do I mean , enigma
TONY: Er one more thing.Does ` first to five ' mean anything to you ? ANTON looks at TONY with loathing .
ANTON: I thought you were the c-cleve one . He walks away into the darkness . TONY sits there busily thinking .
VALENTINA: Thank God it 's only cuts and uises . I thought we 'd lost you .
TONY: If you had n't been there
VALENTINA: I do n't know what 's wrong with him , ut if it 's about the showI do n't care . I 'm tired of itlet the police arrest us . I 'm sick of living like this .
TONY: Do n't say that . What you 're doing is important . Really important . It 's just maybe it should be done in a different way . He is about to kiss her .
PERCY: Change the show ! ? Who the fizzing hell do you think you are ?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Shhh ! He sits down heavily .
TONY: I 'm sorry but.. you 're not modern . People want modern . Look .
PERCY: What about the filth ?
TONY: What ?
PERCY: The filth . The police .
TONY: There 'll be a better class of police too .
PERCY: That 'll be the day .
TONY: The trick is not to hide . Change your colours . Be bold . Go where they would least expect to find you . I think we have been brought together for a reason . I do n't elieve in coincidence . You saved my life . Now let me do something in return . PARNASSUS confers with PERCY .
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Our time 's nearly up This could e what we need .
TONY: This can be my birthday gift to Valentina . VALENTINA smiles and nods to PARNASSUS .
DR. PARNASSUS: Well then For God 's sake let 's do it ! ! !
PERCY: Yeah , okay , but what exactly do we do ?
TONY: Well First of all , I want you to give me your money . All of it .
DR. PARNASSUS: Anton ! Where are you going ? No answer from ANTON .
VALENTINA: What are you doing ? Did n't you do enough damage last night ? Anton I 'm the one who wants to un away ! Are you trying to wreck my irthday , or what ?
TONY: Excuse me , madam . I 'm afraid we ca n't accept this .
WOMAN: Excuse me but , how does this work ? What does it cost ?
TONY: Cost ? Money is no good in the Imaginarium . This is a refuge fo hearts in need of truth . A place for souls to be purified .
WOMAN 2: How long does that take ? I 'm unning late .
TONY: Madam , why should you care about time ? What are your dreams worth in minutes ? The women grow pensive .
TONY: Please , I 'm sorry but , we 're booked solid at the moment .
TONY: We do n't want your money . We want your hopes and dreams . You may make a donation later , if you wish .
POLICEMAN: Alright , I think it 's time to move on , folks .
TONY: Tony
TONY: Oh..look another possibility..
TONY: That was so I had no idea It 's just incredible .
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Hooplah !
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Thank YOU , dear Lady , you give me strength to continue
DR. PARNASSUS: One more to go and we 're free .
GREGOR: Relaxsmell the flowers .
SERGE: You thieving scumbag ! We break every bone in your body !
TONY: No ! Wait ! I can explain ! Give me a chance !
VLADIMIR: We want our money or you die again ! This time for good ! ANTON struggles to his feet .
ANTON: Stop it ! L-leave him alone !
GREGOR: ( bending down and picking a flower , he offers it to
ANTON: Relax . Smell the flowers .
TONY: Did you see me ! ! I almost reached the clouds ! I could haveit was incredibleI was almost there
ANTON: Shut up !
TONY: I made my choice and I climbed I felt so much potential . I could have done anything . I have to have another chanceanother goI need this
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: What ?
PERCY: That cards ! The bloody Tarot cards !
ANTON: You 're a l-liar . You 've been lying to us all along . Who are you ? Who were those thugs ?
TONY: I am not a liar !
ANTON: No ?
TONY: No ! I just did n't divulge everything I knew .
PERCY: Comes to the same thing .
TONY: Absolutely not . Not in law .
ANTON: You stole their money .
TONY: No . I did n't .
ANTON: That 's what they said .
TONY: Are you going to believe them efore you believe me ?
PERCY: Why not ?
TONY: Because they 're irredeemably bad people , and I 'm essentially good . I know that sounds terribly prim and arrogant and self righteous , but I 'm trying to be honest . Look , the truth is in order to get my charity off the ground I needed capital . ANTON looks askance .
VALENTINA: Oh Tony .
TONY: But , can we not talk about me for a moment.. I want to thank the Docto for letting me experience the most sublime , inspiring .
ANTON: So why were they trying to k-kill you ? `` Again ! '' is what they said .
TONY: What ?
ANTON: The first time they hung you from the b-bridge right ? B-because you stole their money .
TONY: Stop saying that ! I did n't steal it ! I did n't have it . I 'd had to invest in infrastructure . I needed more time . When you run a charity you have to give lots of money away . You would n't believe the red tape . The Charity Commission are a unch of fascists . It 's incredible . I mean c'mon give me a breakI almost died today.. and I said I 'm sorry and anyway.. this was supposed to be a special dayit 's Valentina 's birthday .
ANTON: The marks on your face
TONY: Marks ?
ANTON: They scrawled something on you forehead . Symbols Signs

DR. PARNASSUS: And the girl..from the pub . MR NICK shakes his head .
MR NICK: Sally does n't count . Do you , gal ?
DR. PARNASSUS: You 're joking toying with me . Like a cat with a mouse As is your privilege .
MR NICK: Sal did n't get to make a real choice . You were gaga . Out for the count . Would n't be fairAnd you 've got four , thanks to you friend Tony . So we 're even it 's not quite over .

DR. PARNASSUS: I was mortal again on condition that any children I fathered would , on their sixteenth irthday belong to him .
VALENTINA: Him ? VALENTINA ca n't take it in .
DR. PARNASSUS: Your mother never knew . She died efore I had to tell her .
VALENTINA: I do n't believe this ! It ca n't be true . It 's just another of you wretched stories A cruel story !
DR. PARNASSUS: If only

WILKENSON: Mr. Strout has been in the custody°of The Knox County Sherrif 's department since August second , held without bail.The court is obliged to hold a bail hearing within two weeks of incarceration , which is the purpose of our procedings here today . Given the schedule considerations on this docket , the court feels that we should conduct the probable cause hearing in tandem . Witnesses will be called at this time . Unless there are any objections to the contrary this court will recess until 2 00 p.m .
DAVIS: objection . Mrs. Strout 's police interview is already documented , the defense has a copy of it . There 's no reason to waste anymore of the court 's time . - .
KEYES: Your Honor , we just want to review exactly what s. Strout saw on the afternoon of July 17th . Is n't that why we 're here ? The Judge nods .
JUDGE: overruled .
TO NATALIE: Please continue .
RECAPPING: So you were bringing your children up to their bedroom
NATALIE: 0 Right . I was in Jason and Dunk 's room I
KEYES: You left `` them '' ?
NATALIE: My boys . She starts to cry .

KEYES: I 'm sorry , can we just back up ? You said you `` heard the shot '' ?
NATALIE: Yes .
KEYES: You `` heard '' ? s- Strout , did you witness the accident ? Prosecutor Davis jumps up .
DAVIS: b ` ection . There are no grounds to in icate this was an `` accident '' The Judge nods .
TO STENOGRAPHER: Please strike `` accident '' from the record . Ms. Keyes , please rephrase the question .
GENTLY: Mrs. Strout did you actually see the sidearm discharge ?
DAVIS: You sure you do n't want ?
RUTH: I 'm fine . Davis takes a seat across from them .
DAVIS: You see , we ca n't appeal bail - It 's just not set up that way . RUTH - -y You let that bastard walk out and we 're supposed to just sit here ? Do n't tell us there 's nothing to do about this .
RUTH: Oh - I see .
RUTH: And when will that be ? Next week , next month ?
DAVIS: Well honestly - anywhere between twelve and eighteen months ?
RUTH: I thought you said there would be a jury trial sometime in October ! ?
DAVIS: If he was incarcerated the udge would move for an October date - basically to save the County the cost of housing and feeding him as an inmate - But with bail the court date , unfortunately , is always later .
RUTH: Oh my god , oh my god . Matt jumps in .
MATT: But you 're confident you 'll be able to put him away for good then Right ? Davis looks uncomfortable with the question . Ruth sees this . She gathers herself .
RUTH EJ: The things she said in there what is the damage ?
DAVIS: Manslaughter .
RUTH: This was no accident . Be killed our son in cold blood . Ruth .
MATT: How long would he be sent away for ?
DAVIS: Hard to say really . Anywhere between five to fifteen years . We think we have a good shot at the max - fifteen . Even with good ehavior , he 'd do a full ten .
RUTH: Ten years ? Five years ? Are you out of you mind ! ? He killed my son . Does anyone know this ?
DAVIS: I 'm sorry , s. Fowler . I understand . Unfortunately , in situations like this when there is no eye witness , there well , there 's not a lot we can do .
RUTH: You took the whole day ? Matt nods .

She fell into line , and began walking with them . When they eached a certain point , the line divided . She said she knew - that all the millions of women on her side - were the mothers who had lost children-she seemed to find great comfort in that . Ruth does n't react .

'' Next day the old man walks intah the office at the market - near the scales - where he know 's the son of a bitch is gon na come in with his catch . He 's got two six penny nails a hammer , and the bats o'coarse , so he nails those things right intah the wall . The guy at the scales looks at him like he 's nuts `` Whatta ya doing there Ivan '' he says `` Just sending a message '' and the old man walks out .

RUTH: Are you all right ?
MATT: There was a picture with Natalie and the oys hanging on his wall - Ruth looks at him strangely .
GENTLY: .what is it , Matt ?
MATT: - the way she was smiling .
RUTH: What ?
MATT: I do n't know - Ruth looks at the back of Matt 's head .
RUTH: Matt ? He does n't move . He says nothing else . She continues to stare at him .
CIVIL SERVANT: Monitoring . All the usual .
MALCOLM: How did your team do at the weekend ?
CIVIL SERVANT: Yeah , alright . We won .
MALCOLM: Great . Wanker .
EDDIE MAIR: You 've been in the job now for eighteen months , do you think you 're making headway ?
SIMON: Ah . Yes I do . You 'd expect me to say that I suppose . Page 1
JUDY: Mark , are you co-ordinating that millenium goals press release ?
MARK: Yes .
JUDY: Well co-ordinate it better .
MARK: Yes , can do .
JUDY: Is that the Minister ? Bloody nail - has anyone got a nail file ?
SIMON: Have we heard anything from Malcolm about last night 's interview ?
JUDY: No not yet .
SIMON: Perhaps he did n't hear it .
JUDY: Or maybe he 's dead .
SIMON: He might be dead . He might have had that massive stroke we 've all been waiting for . It 's in the post .
MALCOLM: Diarrhoea ? I mean , this is the ministe for International Development . He should e talking about food parcels , not fucking arse-spraying mayhem . SAM laughs .
EDDIE MAIR: You mentioned the word ` war ''
MALCOLM: Steady Eddie
JUDY: He 'll want you to row back from the ` unforeseeable ' thing on Question Time tonight .
SIMON: On Question Time , you know the funny question they always ask at the end ?
JUDY: Yes ?
SIMON: I think we should prep that now . I 'd like to shine on the funny question , cos I 'm a funny guy . With a light touch .
JUDY: There 's this guy , he 's a property tycoon . He 's bought a South Sea Island . It might e something like that , you know . `` If you had to spend the rest of your life on a desert island , who would it be with ? ''
SIMON: Ah . Well , I ca n't say my wife , because I have n't got one , and I ca n't say my girlfriend , because I have n't got one of those either .
JUDY: And do n't say Mandela , that 's
SIMON: No . Boring . And a bloke .
JUDY: Or Keira Knightley .
SIMON: Well , that 's a good idea . Page 4
JUDY: Pervert . Sex . Minister .
SIMON: I do n't think so .
JUDY: People do n't want to know .
SUZY: Did you take the washing out of the machine ?
TOBY: No .
SUZY: What do you mean , no ?
TOBY: No . I did n't take the washing out of the machine .
SUZY: It 's going to go really stale .
TOBY: It 'll be fine .
SUZY: It 's not fine . By the time
TOBY: It is fine . I 'll wear stale pants .
SUZY: I do n't want to go out with some who wears stale pants .
TOBY: Well , there we go . I could go commando , ut I do n't think that 's acceptable in government .
SUZY: Please . So got everything you need fo your first day in International Development ? Page 5
TOBY: Oh Yes . It 's all here . My massive intellect . And an apple for Simon Foster .
SUZY: Simon Fluster .
TOBY: Do n't say that , I 'm rebranding him .
SUZY: Well he was crap on the radio last night . He sounded like a chicken with a wasp up its arse .
TOBY: Well I 'm going to sort that out . After a week I 'll have him sounding like a chicken without a wasp up its arse .
SUZY: Have a good day , good luck honey .
TOBY: Have a good day at the Foreign Office . Try not to annoy Russia .
SUZY: I 'll give you a call later . Keep you phone on . Bye .
TOBY: Yeah , alright .
SUZY: Oh and be careful - cars ! They walk off in separate directions .
TOBY: Are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes , because you 're starting to emind me of my mum . And that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction . Suzy is still in the FO office . Page 6
SUZY: I 'm just checking whether you put last night 's lasagne in the fridge .
MICHAEL: Croissants !
MALCOLM: No . You 're fine to go ahead and print that . It 's lies , you 'd be lying , but go ahead . He did not say unforeseeable . No he did not . Oh , just before you go when I tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conferencewould email be better ? Or a phone call ? Or , hey I know , I 'll write it on a cake , `` Your hack husband betrayed you on the 4th of October , and congratulations on the new baby '' in those little silver balls . Yeah , maybe est to spike it ? Okay . Fuckity-bye !
TOBY: No , it 's fine , it 's in the fridge . I put some clingfilm over it .
SUZY: Why did you put clingfilm on it ?
TOBY: To keep it fresh . Malcolm starts dialling on his phone .
SUZY: It 's in the fridge , that 'll keep it fresh .
TOBY: No , but it still might dry out .
MALCOLM: Yeah , Malcolm Tucker . Can I speak to James Lewis at the PM Programme please ? Page 7
MICHAEL: Still slightly warm . That 's how I like my women as well .
SUZY: Clingfilm is carcinogenic , Toby .
TOBY: No it is n't . That 's a myth . Clingfilm is perfectly safe .
MALCOLM: No , I 'll hold , . what 's he waiting for ? A sex-change ?
TOBY: They would n't sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer . Clingfilm does n't give you cancer . And Lasagne does n't give you syphillis .
MALCOLM: James ! Right Simon Foster ? Yeah , very funny , the Diarrhoea of a Nobody . Listen , we get an easy ride on Tom tomorrow , OK ? No , YOU relax . Tell you what , I 'll come over a lock you in a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown . GET ME FUCKING BRIAN !
SIMON: Paris Hilton ?
JUDY: Are you serious ?
SIMON: Lily Allen .
JUDY: No . No women . Page 8
SIMON: The Olson twins ? Judy gets a call .
JUDY: Hi . Right . I see . She rings off .
SIMON: What ?
JUDY: Malcolm 's coming to see you .
SIMON: Shit . He 's still alive . When 's he due ?
MALCOLM: Now . And do n't say you were n't prepared ecause I rang ahead . Give us a minute , will you love ? Judy gets up as Malcolm turns back to SIMON
JUDY: So you'rewhatever your name is , Dan , the new advisor ? Daniel .
TOBY: Toby .
JUDY: Right . Just most of you lot tend to be called Dan , or Danny , so it 's always worth a punt . OK , hello . As you know , I 'm Judy Molloy , Civil Service Director of Communications for International Development . They shake hands . Page 9
TOBY: Is this a normal morning , or ? Judy 's not got time for questions .
JUDY: Okay , I 've got a meeting in two minutes . And the minister was ubbish in last night 's interview .
TOBY: Rubbish ?
JUDY: It 's a technical term . It means he went on the radio and everyone could hear that he was rubbish .
SIMON: Come on , Malcolm , he asked me for a personal opinion .
MALCOLM: Oh why did n't you say ? I mean , he asked you . Fuck . Of course , that explains it . Yeah . Say , if he 'd asked you to fucking lack up , or give him your PIN number , o shot yourself , would you have done that as well .
SIMON: I would have blacked up . It was the radio and no-one would have known .
MALCOLM: Yeah . Very good .
SIMON: But war is basically unforeseeable is n't it ?
MALCOLM: That is not our line , alright ? Walk the fucking line . Look .
MOR E: Page 10
JUDY: Minister , this is Toby .
MALCOLM: Not the time love . Fuck off . JUDY smiles at MALCOLM , and does n't fuck off .
SIMON: Hey Toby . Glad you could join us . Bit of an odd morning , but 'Welcome to the madhouse ! ' I apologise for Malcolm .
MALCOLM: Do n't apologise for me . You should apologise for yourself . Did I not just tell you to fuck off and yet you 're still here ?
JUDY: That 's correct .
MALCOLM: Hey , foetus boy . Lesson One If I tell you to fuck off what do you do ?
TOBY: Fuck off ?
MALCOLM: You 'll go far.Now fuck off .
TOBY: Right .
SIMON: We were thinking , were n't we Judy , that I could row back on Question Time tonight .
MALCOLM: No , You 're not going on Question Time tonight . You 've been disinvited . Page 11
SIMON: Why ? We 've been prepping Question Time .
MALCOLM: Because they ask fucking questions on Question Time . And you 're no good at questions . If it was Fumbling , Off- Message Shit Fucking Answer Time , you 'd e our main guy . But it 's not .
JUDY: Sorry , why was n't I told about this ?
MALCOLM: Why should I tell you about this ?
JUDY: Because it 's a scheduled media appearance y this department 's Secretary Of State and it therefore falls within my purview
MALCOLM: Your purview ? Where do you think you are sweetheart , in some Regency costume drama ? This is a government department , not a fucking Jane Austen novel . Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on you purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock .
JUDY: Malcolm , your swearing does n't impress me . My husband works for Tower Hamlets and believe me , those kids make you sound like Angela Lansbury .
MALCOLM: She 's married ? The poor bastard .
SIMON: Butokay , Judy 's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment . Are you saying that I 'm now not allowed to make any media appearances ?
MALCOLM: No , not until we can trust you to keep to the line .
SIMON: But I was going to keep to the line `` I do n't actually think war is unforeseeable . '' Page 12
MALCOLM: What is it then ? A beat .
SIMON: Is itI do n't know ? Foreseeable ? No .
MALCOLM: No . Not foreseeable . That 's fucking declaring war . Do you want to fucking declare war ?
SIMON: I 'm a cabinet minister . I did n't get here y screwing up every media appearance I ever had .
MALCOLM: Write this down . It 's neither forseeable nor undorseeable .
SIMON: Right . So not inevitable , but notevitable .
MALCOLM: Okay , you need to work on this fucking line . That includes you , Jane Fucking Austen with the strap-on . Oh , and put the sniff out there that the next time the BBC ambushes a Minister with a war question we 'll drop a bomb on them .
JUDY: I ca n't do that . That 's political , that 's not in my
MALCOLM: Purview , Marie Antoinette ? Weel listen , darling , why do n't you fucking scuttle off back to fucking Cranford and play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks . Let them eat cock ! You , Ron Weasley you do it . Malcolm heads out . Page 13
MICHAEL: You need n't worry about the Canadians . They 're just happy to be there . Yes , well , they always look surprised when they 're invited .
SUZY: Listen , shall I just give Toby a quick call about the Simon Foster thing ? Suzy dials .
TOBY: Hiya . You do know this is the third time you 've rung ? Are you on a new tariff ?
SUZY: So ? How 's it going ? You found the bogs yet ?
TOBY: All a bit manic . It was never like this at Agriculture . People tend not to swea so much about wheat . Apart from farmers . They swear about everything .
SUZY: Can you turn that down a bit ? Look , I 've got a leg up for you . I think we could get Simon into the big meeting with Karen Clark ?
TOBY: Right - Karen Clark fromis that the woman who went round Britain in a coracle for leukemia ? Page 14
SUZY: Karen Clark , US Assistant Secretary of State ?
TOBY: Oh right . Shit . Karen Clark . Wow . Thanks .
SUZY: Hang on , Michael wants to say something .
MICHAEL: Meat .
SUZY: Meat .
MICHAEL: Meat ! Simon 's only going to be meat in the room . Do n't get his hopes up .
SUZY: Yeah , so you know Simon , between us , he 's just going to be meat in the room .
TOBY: Meat ? Judy , nearby , hears this .
SUZY: Yeah . The Americans do n't feel they 're getting a real meeting unless there 's thirty of you on each side . So Simon isyou know those polystyrene peanut things they use to pack electrical goods ? Sort of one of those . But you might not want to tell him that . I ought to go . I love you . Judy 's hovering nearby .
TOBY: Likewise . Affirmative on that .
JUDY: So , quick tour . She starts walking away . Toby follows .
TOBY: Um , I do just need to Page 15
JUDY: Over therethat 's Mike 's patch . Leave Mike to it . He knows what he 's doing . Do n't you Mike ?
MIKE: What ?
JUDY: Exactly . He 's an idiot . He organised 3,000 tents and sanitation packs for Rwanda .
TOBY: Rightis that not ?
JUDY: They needed them in Luanda . Angola . It 's een in the news . And that 's the end of the tour . I 've got to go .
TOBY: Look , I understand your hostility to new wood coming in..
JUDY: There 's a lot of really important people you need to know about , but I have n't got time .
TOBY: Hey , boss .
SIMON: Toby , hi . Sorry about earlier Malcolm . He 's a bit of analpha male , is n't he ?
TOBY: Look , I 've managed to get you into the ig meeting at the Foreign Office this afternoon .
SIMON: The Karen Clark meeting ? Shit , really ? Sure . How did you ?
TOBY: I did it through sheer bloody hard work . Judy walks past . Simon calls out . Page 16
SIMON: Hey Judy . She comes in .
JUDY: Hello ?
SIMON: Tobes here has got me into the big Karen Clark meeting .
JUDY: Wow . Yeah , the Big Meet . How are you spelling that , by the way ?
TOBY: Two ` e 's .
JUDY: Yeah . It might be like that .
SIMON: I think I can work a room , okay ? I 'm not a room virgin .
MICHAEL: Simon .
SIMON: Michael . Page 17
CHAD: Ah , Michael ? I 'm Chad .
MICHAEL: Hello ?
CHAD: We 'd like a dual horse-shoe formation fo the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark , an enclave for the Pentagon delegation . First names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters .
SUZY: Right .
CHAD: Thanks so much . He walks purposefully off .
MICHAEL: My God . Who was that , Young Lankenstein ?
JUDY: Oh he 'll be running something relatively major . They 're all kids in Washington . It 's like Bugsy Malone , but with real guns .
SIMON: No-one will hear me if I say anything . How 's your view ? Can we swap ?
JUDY: I think the meeting 's starting . It is .
SIMON: Well , quickly then , swap . Simon and Judy swap seats .
KAREN: We all agree this is a very tough time , ut I do n't want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this point .
SIMON: Are people thinking that ? That 's a bit hardcore . He cranes again to see .
KAREN: This paper , authored by one of my aides , Liza Weld . You do n't mind me fore- grounding this do you Liza ?
BOB ADRIANO: Although not everyone might agree with the assumptions made in that paper .
KAREN: Really - such as what ?
BOB ADRIANO: The committee feels a much quicke deployment is possible .
KAREN: Which committee ?
BOB ADRIANO: This has been discussed in a number of committees . If I said one committee
KAREN: You did .
ADRIANO: Then that was a slip of the tongue
KAREN: Have you accidentally alluded to some secret committee ? A war committee ?
MICHAEL: If I can interject here , I 'm aware we 're pushed for time . I 'd like to move us on agenda-wise . Our next item is international relief co-ordination .
KAREN: Have you heard of this committee ?
ADRIANO: What 's this Liza Weld paper ? Page 20
SIMON: Should I say something ? She invited me , I should say something . If you do n't say something in the first 10 minutes , you can end up not saying anything at all .
JUDY: I do n't know whether you should say anything .
SIMON: I 'm saying something I think I 'm going to try saying something .
KAREN: Look - I just think it 's worth noting that Ministers in The UK Government , such as our colleague here
SIMON: Is she talking about me ?
KAREN: Simon Foster
SIMON: She 's talking about me !
KAREN: Has made it clear that for them currently war is unforeseeable . Is n't that right Simon ?
SIMON: Well , yes , I mean , that 's what I said . And I stick to what I said . SIMON sits down . Them stands back up .
MICHAEL: I wonder if there are n't some area of mutual agreement we ca n't rattle through here and see how much time we have at the end for this discussion ? He 's ended the debate .
JUDY: Thanks .
SUZY: Is that all fine ?
JUDY: That 's all fine . Thanks for that .
SUZY: Thanks .
SIMON: Come here - we need to talk What do you mean stop being a ` tit ' ? In what way was I being a tit ? Why am I even over here if I 'm not meant to say anything ?
JUDY: You were just meat in the room , Simon .
SIMON: 'Meat in the room ' ? Oh for fuck 's sake Judy . I took an hour out to come ove here and be room meat ? Page 22
TOBY: But you know you 're a prime cut , you 're not - offal .
SIMON: Great , I 'm not liver . What was I , tit meat ?
KAREN: Whichever committee they do n't want me to e a member of , I want to be a member of that . It 's a confused Groucho Marx .
LIZA: Okay . Right . Chad arrives . Karen talks to someone else .
CHAD: Hey Liza . Your paper got a majo citation . You must be psyched Karen ought it up .
LIZA: Shethat was her call . I did n't know it had been that widely read .
CHAD: You could not write anything that clashes more violently with the current climate than you the one you wrote if you were trying , and it almost seems like you were trying .
LIZA: I was n't trying , believe me .
CHAD: You are like the woman from The Omen , you 've given birth to a demon and it 's going to kill you . Page 23
LIZA: You probably identify with the kid from The Omen right ?
CHAD: Ooh .
LIZA: See , you 're an only child , are n't you ?
CHAD: You bring this up whenever you run out of arguments . I do n't see how my parents ' limited reproductive abilities reflects adly on me . I 'm the sperm that made it . Liza walks off , over to Karen .
SIMON: What 's that all about ? It looks important .
KAREN: My teeth hurt . I think the veneers are chipped . Do they look chipped ? Liza stares into Karen 's mouth .
LIZA: Well , I think that one , that one 's always een there , right ? I 'm not sure . Have you got any painkillers ?
KAREN: Oh , do n't look at my teeth .
JUDY: Sshhh ! Page 24
KAREN: I do n't want to risk a dentist here .
TOBY: Hey Liza !
LIZA: Oh Hi hi ?
TOBY: Toby ? It 's Toby .
LIZA: Hi . Hi .
JUDY: What are you doing ? You look like you 're practicing baby massage .
TOBY: She did the Kennedy scholarship at my college . I had a small thing for her .
JUDY: I can imagine .
TOBY: I 'm not sure she remembered me .
JUDY: No , that is one of the side effects of Rohypnol . Page 25
KAREN: Linton has set up a secret war committee , I just know it . I mean , Linton is an absolute lunatic , Liza . He is dangerous . The voices in his head are now singing arbershop together .
SIMON: Yeah . Jesus . I really really hope there 's not a war . It 's going to be a nightmare . It 's bad enough having to cope with the fucking Olympics .
PRESS: Minister ! /Simon ! /Mr Foster ! Simon is taken aback .
SIMON: Fuck . Who let the dogs out ? We do n't need this .
JUDY: Er , you wanted a chance to row back on the war . Do you want to nail the line ?
SIMON: What ? No . No . I 'll freestyle it . The press are calling .
REPORTER 1: Is war unforeseeable Minister ?
SIMON: Look , loads of things that are actually very likely are also unforeseeable . Y'know , For the plane in the fog the mountain is unforeseeable , but then it , is suddenly very real and inevitable .
REPORTER: Sorry , are you saying that ?
SIMON: What I 'm saying is that to - walk the oad of peace , sometimes you need to be eady to climb the mountain of conflict . Thank you !
JUDY: I did try to warn you .
SIMON: You did try to warn me but you did n't actually stop me , did you ? . That 's like shouting 'Train ! ' as I get hit by a train . You should go 'Look ! Train ! There 's a Fucking Train ! '
JUDY: It 's Malcolm for me too .
SIMON: How does he do that ? Hello ? Page 27
MALCOLM: Simon . I do n't like finding out about people I work with via the news , unless they 've died . Get over here now so we can address at least one of those issues .
TOBY: The thing is . On the war . With you profile.. Maybe we should - get it out there ? That the war is a resigning issue fo you .
SIMON: You ca n't say it 's a resigning issue . Because you then have to resign .
JUDY: You are having a really great first day you know that ? They walk in , Malcolm 's there .
MALCOLM: You are supposed to be a Cabinet Minster . You are supposed to be officer class . Do n't do this . Do n't make waves .
SIMON: We can do without the ritual humiliation , Malcolm . You know I 'm against talking up the war .
MALCOLM: You 're against talking up the war ? Is that why you said , `` Climb the mountain of conflict '' ?
SIMON: I 'm just saying . I might be forced to the verge of making a stand .
MALCOLM: Right , you two , The White Stripes , outside . Simon makes to leave with them .
CONT'D: Look , I admire you , I really do . Making a stand . So , I take it I can tell the PM you do n't want to go to Washington ?
SIMON: To where ?
MALCOLM: Washington . The boss wants you over there on a fact-finder . Problems we might face if it all goes boombastic in the Middle East .
SIMON: Oh . Right .
MALCOLM: But you were saying , you are on the verge of your stand
SIMON: Well , look - I do n't know what words I used in the heat of the moment , but maybe in a sense I was on the verge . But that 's the important thing - I was on the verge . Not in any way decided .
MALCOLM: Christ on a bendy-bus , Simon , stop being such a faffing fuck-arse .
SIMON: I am standing my ground on the verge . Page 29
MALCOLM: Well , when you go to America , talk to Karen Clarke at the State Department ,
SIMON: I 'll give it a whirl .
MALCOLM: But keep away from Linton Barwick . He 's pushing the war for Caulderwood 's lot . I 'll deal with him . Dangerous fucker . keeps a live hand-grenade as a paperweight . True story .
SIMON: Oh right . I wo n't talk to him .
MALCOLM: Talk to as few people as possible . That would be best for you .
KAREN: Okay - so , priorities are take a shower , get me on Linton 's War Committee , get me a dental appointment . Not necessarily in that order .
LIZA: He 's doing his desperate chorus girl thing , hanging around trying to catch Linton 's eye . That 's why he 's wearing his push-up bra today .
CHAD: Assistant Secretary of State hi .
KAREN: So listen , Liza , I need you to find out the names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill .
LIZA: Dullest ? Page 31
KAREN: Because Linton is not going to call it the big horrible scarey wa committeethey 'll have buried the wa committee under the most boring name they can think of . 'Diverse Strategy Committee'- not that , I 'm on that . But it 'll be a committee that sounds so tedious you want to self-harm .
KAREN CONT'D: Can you get me General Miller at the Pentagon ? My teeth hurt like hell .
LIZA: Sick of hearing about the teeth Liza goes to her desk , picks up her landline . LIZA Hi . I 'm calling from Karen Clark 's office about a paper written by a staffer here . We need to know if 'Post War Planning Parameters , Implication 's and Possibilities ' has reached Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick yet ? Yeahby Liza Weld . 'Pwip Pip ' ? It 's already been given an acronym ? No I do n't want to fast-track it . Would it possible to slow-track it ? Well can we create one ?
BOB ADRIANO: I could request the glass be frosted ? Page 32
SIMON: What 's she so fucking happy about ? Is she laughing at me ?
TOBY: You want me to order some blinds ? Or I could get some heavy curtains with swags and a pelmet .
SIMON: Yes . I do .
TOBY: Oh . Okay
SIMON: Can we go somewhere else ? They walk to Box Room .
TOBY: I could work with that , definitely . Plus she can be a bit you know ? `` Everything 's a bit shit is n't it ? ''
SIMON: `` So you 're the President ? And I 'm supposed to be impressed by that ?
TOBY: Yeah . `` My husband works in Towe Hamlets . ''
SIMON: `` That 's much harder than being President '' . Okay . It 's settled . Fuck it . She 's staying behind . Go and tell her .
KAREN: Which brings us on to Any Other Business .
BOB ARIANO: Itty .
CHAD: Commissary ?
KAREN: Ok. Why do n't you just recap for me all the committees that you 're currently sitting on ? Page 36
LIZA: Oh no . Holy Mother of . Everyone is just looking at her .
KAREN: Okay , Liza come with me .
CHAD: Go , Buffy - you belong to the vampire queen now .
KAREN: Where are at you at with the committees ?
LIZA: I got it down to two . The Aims and Policy Alignment Committee . Here - put some down your front - you do n't want it to go down your And the Future Planning Committee .
KAREN: Well , it 's not the first one . I set that one up . Does that really sound dull to you ? I thought that was a good name .
LIZA: Right , no , it is a good name .
KAREN: Okay , find out if it is definitely the Future Planning Committee .
LIZA: Okay . Okay . Right , listen , I might go and do that . You 're not going to shout at me if I go and do that are you ?
KAREN: I 'm not a fucking monster Liza , okay ? Will you stop implying I 'm some kind of monster ?
LIZA: Bob ! Bob Adriano stops and turns .
BOB ADRIANO: Liza . Liza sprints and catches up with him . Page 38
LIZA: So listen , Bob , there 's something I eally want to tell you . We 're having a hunk of the month competition , and I just did n't want you to be feelobjectified in any way.and
BOB ADRIANO: Oh really ?
LIZA: Karen knows about the Future Planning Committee .
BOB ADRIANO: I have no idea what you 're talking about .
TOBY: This is cool .
SIMON: Do n't be callow Toby . We 're on official usiness .
TOBY: Oh God yeah , of course . Page 39
SIMON: Did you book a car ?
TOBY: Me ? No . I mean , Judy will have got someone to do it . He calls on his phone .
JUDY: What car situation ?
TOBY: The airport car ?
JUDY: That 's not my job Toby . That 's Robbie 's job to book it , your job to check it and confirm it . Alright ? Good night . The call is over .
TOBY: Yeah . She 's really embarrassed . Sounds like a snarl up her end . I 'll see what we can do ? He 's looking panicked - then .
SIMON: ` Simon Forester ? ' Page 40
TOBY: Hi we 're the Simon Foster party ?
SIMON: I almost feel like there should be hookers . Do you know what I mean ? Really , here , we should have hookers .
TOBY: Hey Gav , I 'm in a fucking motorcade !
DRIVER: You want girls ?
SIMON: What ? Oh no . God no . No no no no no . I was just - I was just joking . I do n't want hookers . I hate hookers . I mean not in an aggressive way . I 'm just not interested . But thanks . Thanks very much .
TOBY: It 's like a hangar for businessmen .
SIMON: Toby , have you . ?
TOBY: I have n't been to an ATM yetI 've only got English .
GENERAL MILLER: Hey Karen . You look beautiful .
KAREN: I bet you say that to all the girls .
GENERAL MILLER: Yeah I do . And some of the guys .
KAREN: That 's why you should n't run for Senate . Too many skeletons in your enormous closet .
GENERAL MILLER: Yeah , do n't believe the hype . I 'm just thinking about doing something . I 'm more than just a soldier , Karen .
KAREN: That 's right , you 're passionate about education and housing and what 's the other thing ?
GENERAL MILLER: Lingerie . Page 42
KAREN: That 's right .
GENERAL MILLER: And bestiality .
KAREN: I 'd forgotten about that . Are you still allergic to that dog ?
GENERAL MILLER: Yes , yes . I wake up and my eyes are closed and my head is swollen and I look like a giant ball sack .
KAREN: Oh my god , they do have memdication fo that..but a beautiful ball sack , though . And how 's the pentagon ?
GENERAL MILLER: It 's kicked up a level . Talking invasion eal soon .
KAREN: Is there somewhere we can talk ?
GENERAL MILLER: I do n't know , I do n't live in this house .
KAREN: What if someone comes in now ?
GENERAL MILLER: I ca n't think of an excuse that would work can you ?
KAREN: No . Just be careful . Do n't mess stuff up .
GENERAL MILLER: Okay so that 's total minimum European Theatre requirement . He shows her a figure on a piece of paper .
KAREN: Er - you 've lost me .
GENERAL MILLER: Not anymore it is n't . Okay so this is total current deployment . Europe , Asia . And the contingency already deployed . So the current number of combat troops available for an invasion according to these figures would be
COMPUTER VOICE: Twelve .
KAREN: Thousand ?
GENERAL MILLER: No , twelve . Twelve soldiers . Twelve .
KAREN: You 're shitting me .
GENERAL MILLER: Of course I 'm shitting you , but 12 thousand is n't enough . Twelve thousand 's about how many are going to die . And you eally need a few guys alive at the end of a war or it looks like you 've lost .
KAREN: Uh-huh . Tomorrow I 've got to meet these Brits . Simon Foster . He 's the guy that said war was unforseeable , and I think he could very useful on the committee ecause he could internationalise the dissent . Page 44
GENERAL MILLER: You 're going to use him as a little meat puppet .
SIMON: Tobes . Hi . So ! What 's the plan ? What swanky reception are we going to ?
TOBY: What 's the plan ? For tonight ?
SIMON: Well that 's what I 'm asking you Toby , my chief aide , my political advisor .
TOBY: I do n't know , I thought tonight we 'd be tired ?
SIMON: Well I am tired but I 'm also a caree politician Toby , in the political powerhouse of the world for forty-eight hours . So I thought it might be nice to , you know , go out rather than sit in my oom trying to spank one out watching a shark documentary , because I 'm scared if I watch a porno it 'll end up in the Register of Members Interests . So what have you got ?
TOBY: Okay What have I got ?
SIMON: Do n't bullshit me Toby .
TOBY: Okay - so far , we have one flye under the door for happy hour in the bar - which might be interesting ? And I have the number of a guy I was with at Uni who I believe now works for CNN out here .
SIMON: No . Page 45
TOBY: No ?
KAREN: Liza , where are you ?
LIZA: Waving at you .
KAREN: Make yourself more visible .
LIZA: I 'm practically on top of you . They meet .
KAREN: You can stop talking on your phone now . Look , I have to leave . Phone Simon Foster 's guy . Tell them to come to the war committee . I 'll give them some face time around ten o'clock . It 'll be coffee and Danishtea..they 're going to want tea . Tea and sympathy . Tea and a handjob , whatever .
LIZA: Ok .
TV NARRATOR: There is still a great deal that is unknown about great white shark mating ehaviour
TOBY: Well it is unbelievably hectic . Page 46
SIMON: You can definitely spot the female ones ca n't you ? !
TOBY: Attending the war committee . That 's big . I mean , I have been on a committee efore . `` Challenges for the cheese market '' - that was a big one utyes , sure I 'd love a drink . Forty minutes ? Great . Bye bye bye-bye-bye-bye-bye bye .
SIMON: Come in.I just was n't expecting you to e here . Physically here . Obviously , you 're always in my heart .
MALCOLM: I 'm here , I 'm there , I 'm fucking everywhere . I am the egg-man .
SIMON: Have you come to insult me in a different time zone ?
TOBY: No , off out now for a drink with heryeah , yeah , ha-di-ha , but nothing 's going to happen there . Little Toby 's staying in his hammock tonight . Toby checks himself in the mirror .
MALCOLM: Hello ! !
TOBY: Fuck ! Malcolm ! Jesus .
MALCOLM: You 're meant to shit yourself in there . Not out here .
TOBY: Right . I 've got us on to Linton 's Future Planning Committee in the morning .
SIMON: Okay . What 's that ? Page 48
TOBY: It 's the war committee .
MALCOLM: What ? The actual.war committee ?
TOBY: Yeah , Liza says that
MALCOLM: Who 's going to be there ?
TOBY: Karen Clark , Liza , me and Simon . Simon and me .
MALCOLM: Who else is going Jimmy Osmond ? Gwyneth Paltrow ? You 've been invited to a diversion . The real committee , the real thing , that 's happening at The White House . Toby picks his jacket up .
TOBY: Yeah well , I 'll text you the details ecause I 'm going to go out.for A quick drink with some State Department bods .
MALCOLM: Do n't mention this to the press , ok ? Do n't mention it to anyone . Because if the press get a whiff there 's a wa committee , even a cardboard one , every fucker in this town is going to turn up and try and get on it . So no matter what gay bar you end up , keep it schtumm . Malcolm flicks the TV over to a news channel .
SIMON: I was watching that . Malcolm looks at him .
MALCOLM: I have to have a word with you . You might want to slip into your negligee . Toby heads out . Page 49
LIZA: You see those guys ? The mosh pit ?
TOBY: Yes , I do n't think I 've ever seen a more civilised 'mosh pit ' it 's more of a mosh caucus actually .
LIZA: House staffers , Senators ' interns , most of them are half-man half-PDF file . Tonight they rage hard . Tomorrow they go ack to the hill and argue noise eduction legislation . They 're chuckling , having a good time .
TOBY: You 're worried .
LIZA: It 's Pwip Pip .
TOBY: I 'm sorry ? Pip Pip ? Is this a person or a cell phone tarrif or..
LIZA: It 's my paper . On the war . Pros and Cons of the war . But I came up with too many cons . The pro-war guys have started calling me ` Connie ' . So , yes I 'm fucking worried . My career 's on the line .
TOBY: Yeah- I noticed you 're worried , cos I saw you looking worried . I 'm perceptive like that . But Do n't worry .
LIZA: Okay , this place blows . I 'm going . What are you doing ? Page 50
TOBY: Well I 'm incredibly tired . It feels like my brain 's eight hours behind but my liver 's 12 hours ahead .
LIZA: You do n't want to come back to my place for a quick catch up ? It 's an alluring offer .
TOBY: However , due to technological developments I no longer need sleep , but am physically rejuvenated by alcohol !
LIZA: Yeah I live in Washington . So that does n't really work for me .
MALCOLM: We are under enormous pressure Simon . Karen will want you to say , ` war is unforeseeable ' . Linton will want you to talk up ` climbing the mountain of conflict ' . You say nothing , okay ? You ca n't swing both ways , you 're not David fucking Bowie .
SIMON: Right . Can I go to bed now ?
MALCOLM: No , we 're going to run that through .
SIMON: Am I being tortured ? Page 51
TOBY: Hello I need a number for a taxi in Washington DC . Straight through please . He 's on the street .
LIZA: Marcel 's is good .
SIMON: Uh-huh .
KAREN: You should go to La Taverna , the Greek place . It 's fantastic .
LIZA: They set fire to the cheese . It 's a lot of fun . Page 52
SIMON: It sounds a lot of fun .
KAREN: There 's the aerospace museum , the National Gallery .
SIMON: Do they set fire to the paintings ? Polite laughter . Toby comes in .
TOBY: Hi I 'm sorry I 'm so late .
KAREN: And this is your guy ?
SIMON: Yes . He 's , you know , among my guys . Toby shoots Simon a look .
KAREN: I 'm Karen . And I believe you already know Liza .
TOBY: Yes . From college , in England .
KAREN: Pulled an all-nighter ?
TOBY: Yes , I , uh , got led astray .
KAREN: Oh who by ?
TOBY: Uh , well I ran into - people . There 's some people from - the MoD over and
KAREN: Not Penny Grayling ?
TOBY: Er - no , another - gang ?
KAREN: Right . Wow . I did n't know you had so many delegations in town . Page 53
TOBY: The British are coming !
KAREN: Well , I need to just check out a couple of things this seems like a good point to break things up .
SIMON: Er - no problem .
LIZA: It 's been great .
SIMON: Terrific .
KAREN: I really appreciate this .
TOBY: Brilliant .
SIMON: Toby I do n't want to read you the riot act here but I am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act . Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1 . Do n't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey . ` The British are coming ' ?
TOBY: So I turned up late to the meeting Simon . I 'm sorry . But it 's not like I threw up in there . Page 54
SIMON: No you 're right . I should be thanking you for not throwing up . Well done . You 're a star . You did n't wet yourself , you 're in the right city , you did n't say anything overtly racist , you did n't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo ' . No I 'm being unfair , you got so much right . Without actually being there for the beginning of one of the iggest meetings of my career . You 're a legend . An uncomfortable beat .
TOBY: That was just - the first bit was it ? We 're going back in do you think ?
SIMON: We 'd barely said hello . I 've had muggings that have lasted longer than that . We eally only spoke about flammable cheese .
LIZA: Are these all requests to get on the committee ? What 's going on ? Did someone post an invite on Facebook ? I 'm drowning in Senators . It 's Senator soup here .
TOBY: Hi Liza . They 're uncomfy with each other .
LIZA: Hey Toby . Toby gets up for a private word .
TOBY: You feeling okay ?
LIZA: Yes , I 'm feeling fine . Why were you late ?
TOBY: Becauseyou knowyou did n't wake me up . Page 55
LIZA: You looked so sweet . I thought you knew what you were doing .
TOBY: I was asleep , of course I did n't . That 's how people walk out of windows .
STAFFER: Hey Liza , I 've got another call about the Committee from Senator Crudden 's office , he wants in too .
LIZA: What is going on here ? Fuck . Why 's this my problem ? Toby you sure you did n't do ad ? You did n't mention the committee to anyone else ?
TOBY: Nada . Nada.. Bad-da . Nada-bada bing-bong ding-dang-dong . I have no idea what I 'm saying anymore I think I really am still quite drunk .
CHAD: Everyone is so hot for your paper . I 'm unning off another ten copies . It 's spreading like a virus , Liza . You 're in hot water . You 're lobsterising .
LIZA: I do n't feel that .
CHAD: It 's by degrees . Wafting . Bisque . I smell lobster . Can you smell lobster , Toby ? Simon calls Toby back over .
TOBY: I need to
LIZA: Sure . Toby goes back to Simon Page 56
MALCOLM: Yeah yeah . Hunky dory . Can I get a coffee ? He gives AJ his coat .
JUDY: Simon 's going to the war committee I thought you knew ?
MALCOLM: I thought I was going to the wa committee ? Tell me where the fuck it 's happening ! Page 58
JUDY: It 's on the 7th floor in room 712 . Oh Malcolm , do you like how I 'm telling you what 's going on where you are ?
MALCOLM: Well let me tell you what 's going on where you are sweet heart , a certain vinegar faced maniplulative cowbag is about to find that she 's out of a fucking job JUDY hangs up .
SIMON: Here she comes - shit - look like we 're meeting , look like we 're having a meeting !
TOBY: and if you look at the line they take in Newsweek - that 's very much another narrative .
KAREN: See you at the committee .
SIMON: Yeah , yeah sure , see you in a mo . Just finishing off some stuff . Okay , we 're all done there . Let 's roll .
TOBY: I do n't think you can say that anymore here . They do n't like that .
SIMON: Shut up . Follow them . Do n't lose them . Lets rock . Page 59
KAREN: Hello ?
SIMON: Hello .
KAREN: Are you joining me or shall I see you there ?
SIMON: See you there . I do n't need to do any of the things you need to go in there to do , so I 'll just see you there .
GENERAL MILLER: Hi , I 'm in seat 204 , row W. Will I be able to see the big screen from there ? Oh , and can I get one of those big pointy foam hands with ` Go , Monster Trucks ! ' written on it ?
TOBY: There he is . General George Miller .
SIMON: Right , yep . There he is . Page 60
TOBY: That 's the second time in 24 hours I 've had a partially obscured view of him .
GENERAL MILLER: Just so you know Karen and I did not appreciate having to sneak around like Mulder and Scully trying to find out about this committee .
ADRIANO: I have no idea how they all heard sir . There must have been a leak .
GENERAL MILLER: Look at Adriano . Poor fuck . He looks like he 's with his Daddy `` Sorry , Bob , you 're adopted . From a couple with hereditary heart defects . ''
KAREN: `` And your mother only ever kept your baby clothes for the purposes of voodoo . ''
SIMON: I 'm room meat again . This is a massive abattoir of room meat . Stay outside Tobes , I need a guy on the outside . Make friends with Chad , that boy from The Shining . He knows stuff . Pump him .
TOBY: Oh no . I want to stay in here with Miller . Do n't make me pump Chad .
SIMON: I 'm making you pump Chad . Go on . Toby gets up to leave .
TOBY: No it wo n't . It 'll be difficult difficult lemon difficult .
KAREN: Assistant Secretary here on point 6 , it feels like there 's an assumption that we 'll be invading . Should we talk about the practical ? I mean this is the wa committee after all ?
MALCOLM: Bitch !
KAREN: But what I 'm asking is has a decision een reached in principle to advocate invasion ?
SIMON: I 'm justwatching with interest . IN Britain we have a saying for complicated situations such as this , which is that it 's ` Difficult , difficult , lemon , difficult . ' He goes back to his text .
KAREN: That 's just ridiculous . You have no basis for saying that .
TOBY: So - do you want to go out and get some lunch ?
CHAD: Are you kidding ? Lunchtime is work time .
TOBY: Yes , what an incredibly depressing motto . You see you 're playing into the hands of the French saying that .
CHAD: Yeah work hours are too valuable - fo networking . You got ta get in at like 6 work till 8.30 Then start making those connections baby . Emails and admin at lunch . See if you can play some strategic racquetball through the pm . Then in the six till midnight slot chow down on some serious policy work .
TOBY: Right . And what - friends , family , novels , sexual inter-course you 're going to save those for your thirties and forties ?
MALCOLM: Are you fucking me about ? Page 65
SIMON: Thanks very much , butit 's all a bit complex really , in terms of my Linton pulls away , starts walking off .
MALCOLM: What the fuck does that mean ? ` All roads lead to Munich ' ?
SIMON: Well it just meansI guess , I do n't know what it means .
MALCOLM: ` All roads lead to Munich ' ?
SIMON: It 's beautiful .
TOBY: If you pull it out , America deflates .
MALCOLM: Do n't mock that ! The closest you 'll come to getting one of those is buying a Toblerone . Mark Hadley 's dad 's died .
SIMON: Oh no . Should we send Mark a card ?
MALCOLM: Nah , I 'll send him a ouija board so they can keep in touch . Page 67
SIMON: So what are we getting back to ? Apart from a nice cup of tea and some knife crime ?
TOBY: Constituency surgery in Northampton .
SIMON: Great , meeting my constituents . It 's like eing Simon Cowell , but without the ability to say , ` Fuck off , you 're mental . '
ROZ: Sorry , could you ? You just need to kick the bottom quite hard .
SIMON: Look at them . They all have that smell.like a charity shop , you know ? Afternoon !
ROZ: Right , here you go , you 're pretty booked up - there 's a list on the desk . I 'm just going to have a look at the guttering .
SIMON: I 'm just back from America , so it was pretty tough to make it up here - but you know . That 's me .
ROZ: Of course . Right . How was the President ? Page 68
SIMON: Good actually .
TOBY: And what was the White House like ?
SIMON: Blown up by spaceships .
MILLER: Twelve-thirty .
BOB ADRIANO: Um , hold on General And into Linton 's office . But - it 's empty .
MILLER: What the fuck ?
BOB ADRIANO: Yeah , Secretary Linton Barwick wanted me to let you know his last - meeting looks like it 's over-running . He sends apologies .
MILLER: He stood me up ? They 're better be a fucking good reason . Like he 's dead . That is just plain fucking rude . I mean , how would he like it if I just did a big hairy shit on his desk ?
BOB ADRIANO: You 're very w-welcome to wait , we have newspapers and periodicals ? Page 69
MILLER: Yeah well excuse me if at this time of national crisis I do n't sit with a thum up my ass flipping through Time magazine eating pop tarts ? Tell him to call me . But he might not get through cos I 'm a fucking busy man . He finds himself heading into Karen 's office .
KAREN: Hey , what is it ?
MILLER: Yeah - can I hang around in here for a while ?
KAREN: Er . Sure . Why ?
MILLER: Do I need a fucking reason ? Linton 's playing me like a fucking turkey drumstick on a big bass drum .
KAREN: Look , I was going to order food , do you want to eat .
MILLER: Yeah . Order us some cute mammals . Alive . A lamb or a piglet so I can snap it 's fucking neck .
MRS MCDAIRMID: My point is - if the septic tank - if we did n't know it was there in the first place how can we be responsible for it now ?
SIMON: Yes . No . I understand .
MRS MCDAIRMID: It 's under the communal drive . Why should we get it pumped ?
ROZ: Well it 's not a council sceptic tank so they 're not legally obliged to pump it
MRS MCDAIRMID: Look , according to the paperwork there 's four metric tons of of shit under there . That 's not all me , is it ? I 'm not a flipping elephant am I ?
SIMON: No , of course not . Nor should you be treated like one . Okay , Mrs McDairmid . Leave it with me . I 'm sure there must be a way through this . Alright ? Mrs Kendrick heads out .
ROZ: Er , Colin Lowe .
SIMON: Jesus . Still on about bendy buses ? No . Tell him no . What else ? Toby closes the laptop .
ROZ: Pauline Michaelson 's son about the constituency office wall .
PAUL MICHAELSON: Hi , thanks for seeing me Mr. Foster .
SIMON: Hi Paul , call me Simon . You 've met Roz . Page 71
PAUL MICHAELSON: I know I have .
SIMON: Lovely .
PAUL MICHAELSON: Okay , Simon , I 'll try to keep it brief ecause I can see you 're a busy man . There 's a bloke out there wants to make it illegal to talk in a foreign language in shops .
SIMON: Yes , well , this place can become a magnet for the mentally dispossessed . And fo sensible people like yourself , Paul .
PAUL MICHAELSON: Patronising .
ROZ: Why do n't you explain your issue , M Michaelson ?
PAUL MICHAELSON: Isorry , is this a joke ? How many times ? For the fourth fing time . The side wall . Of this property . You wall . Is falling over . On to my mum 's garden . She called you up - but she got fobbed off by your people . Because she 's not Lord Snooty in his posh car . Because she 's not Madonna on a horse .
SIMON: ThatI agree , it 's unacceptable . Toby comes back in , hands Simon a coffee .
PAUL MICHAELSON: Do you know what this is ? That 's your constituency office hold music . I do n't want it in my head , do I ?
SIMON: We did arrange to get a quote from a uilder , but Roz has a call on the landline . Page 72
ROZ: Patch from London . They say it 's urgent . Karen Clark ? Is she the coracle woman ?
SIMON: Right . Paul , I really need to take this , ut I have n't forgotten about you , okay ?
PAUL MICHAELSON: No , well I 'm not going anywhere , Simon . You wo n't be able to forget me because I 'll be sitting here staring at you .
SIMON: Toby , can I hand Paul over to you ?
PAUL MICHAELSON: `` Can I fob Paul off with you ? ''
TOBY: So , Paul , where are we up to ? I was out getting coffee . Sorry . He grabs a pen and paper .
GENERAL MILLER: See , this is the problem with civilians wanting to go to war . When you 've been there you do n't want to go back unless you absolutely have to . It 's like France .
KAREN: You finally read Liza 's paper ?
GENERAL MILLER: Course , I read it . I 'm a voracious eader . I 'm the fucking Gore Vidal of the Pentagon . You do n't want that ? Page 73
KAREN: Yes I want that . I want that , that , that , that and that . Those I do n't care about . And these let 's pack up and drop on North Korea .
GENERAL MILLER: Someone should leak this .
KAREN: Someone maybe shaped a little bit like you .
GENERAL MILLER: Me ? Are you kidding ?
KAREN: You have more gravitas .
GENERAL MILLER: Exactly . I 'm too senior . I ca n't leak . Leaking is for people like your Liza and the Boy called It out there . It 's insane . Not only is the case against war incredibly strong , the case for is caveated to hell . `` Most analysts believe the state is looking to expand aggressively beyond its orders '' Then here in the caveats , the only source is ` Ice Man ' - a possible alcoholic - who 's probably called that cos he gets through ten bags / icebergs a day in his fucking vodka tonics . INR say we ca n't trust him . That 's us disputing our own findings . Has Linton read this ?
KAREN: I 'm not sure he reads . You 're a General . Have him killed .
GENERAL MILLER: You see this is why we never got together . That and the hobo teeth .
KAREN: This is a private call right unrecorded , secure line etc etc ?
SIMON: Well , yeah . I mean , your lot are probably getting it somehow , but our lot should n't e. Paul Michaelson calls over .
PAUL MICHAELSON: I 'm still here , Simon .
KAREN: What 's going on Simon ?
SIMON: Departmental business . About a wall .
KAREN: Gaza ?
SIMON: Uh-huh . What can I do for you ?
KAREN: Where were you in the committee ? I called for back-up , you sat there like a dum sack of shit . Maybe worse , cos at a molecular level a bag of shit is probably fizzing with energy .
SIMON: Well - okay . Yes . Um . Well , I have to say Karen , I have a clear strategy here . I 'm playing the long game .
KAREN: There is no long game . They 've bounced us into a short game . You looked like awhat do you call it in England ? A 'wanke
SIMON: We do n't call it that , no But she 's gone .
TOBY: Paul , look , mate Page 75
PAUL MICHAELSON: Patronising .
TOBY: Sorry . But I 'm on your side . I have to look after my Mum too . You do , or they get shafted do n't they ? So Simon wants to talk . Roz takes over .
PAUL MICHAELSON: I 'm going to pursue this with , what do they call it ? Extreme prejudice , to the very end . I can be enormously persistent . Ask my ex-girlfriend .
ROZ: Okay , well , I 'll take your details . Roz leads Paul away
SIMON: That guy 's a bit full-beam .
TOBY: Full-beam ?
SIMON: Yeah , full-beam . Headlights . I kept thinking , is he going to nut me . He appears not to be nutting me , but he might well nut me .
TOBY: So what did Karen Clark want ?
SIMON: Do you think I came over as weak on the committee over there ?
TOBY: Well , uh , no , of course not . I suppose - Simon 's phone goes again . He winces picks up .
KAREN: Also - the war committee got leaked , and that leak came from your department . Page 76
SIMON: I find that difficult to believe .
KAREN: I want action to be taken . I want a head . On a plate . To go .
SIMON: You do n't work here . You 're not my boss . Fuck off . You ca n't make me sack people .
JUDY: About what ?
SIMON: I think you know .
JUDY: Sorry , this is the wrong extension . I 'll put you through now .
SIMON: Come , come into my office .
JUDY: Why ? Why do you need to see me ?
TOBY: What 's this ? Page 77
JUDY: It 's the mad man about the wall .
TOBY: The war ?
JUDY: The wall .
SIMON: Can you come into my office so I can tell you off ? Toby answers his phone , resigned .
TOBY: Hello . Can I help you ?
PAUL MICHAELSON: These ` temporary buttresses ' you got put up .
TOBY: Right ?
PAUL MICHAELSON: They 're basically a pair of twigs . Thin twigs . Page 78
TOBY: I 'm sure they 're not twigs .
PAUL MICHAELSON: No they 're twigs . Are you getting a picture of those twigs ? That wall could fall on my mum and crush her . Do you know how old she is ? Mum , how old are you ? I want to tell the newspaper guy .
MALCOLM: I want a word with the minister and Charlotte Fucking Bronte .
PAUL MICHAELSON: You 're never fucking sixty . You 're olde than that . Sixty . How old are you really ?
TOBY: Could you tell your mum to stay away from the wall just for the time being ?
PAUL MICHAELSON: She needs to get to her plants . She has to water them . Plants need water .
TOBY: No , sure , but could she use a hose , from a distance ?
PAUL MICHAELSON: She does n't have a hose , she 's got a watering can . This is like talking to a ick wall about a brick wall . Get that down , that 's gold .
KAREN: Liza , what 's up ? Why is everyone running around ? This better be a fucking fire drill .
LIZA: The President has said he 's vetoing tarrifs on Chinese auto imports .
KAREN: Shit . Karen calls over to a staffer , ABBEY .
ABBEY: Mr Barwick has asked me to Karen is beginning to lose it .
KAREN: You work to me , Abbey , you fucking work to me . Get me the statement . Or I will call security and have you escorted off the premises via the window .
LIZA: Sorry , why is that ? He'swhat , uttering the Chinese up ?
KAREN: He needs them to at least abstain in the security council . A beat .
LIZA: We 're going to the UN .
KAREN: Yes , we 're going to the UN .
LIZA: Shit . Page 80
KAREN: I should be told this fucking stuff ! I 'm going into Linton 's office and pulling the pin on his grenade .
LIZA: Do n't do that .
KAREN: I 'm fucking joking .
LIZA: Oh .
KAREN: Why did n't you know about this ?
LIZA: Well since I created the budget deficit the President does n't tend to run things y me anymore .
KAREN: Do n't get funny with me . I am not in the mood .
LIZA: No . I 'm getting that .
MALCOLM: `` While Foster jets around at the taxpayer 's expense , his constituency headquarter 's wall 's collapsing and he does n't give a shit .
SIMON: It does n't say that .
MALCOLM: No but it says ` Wall-ace and Gromitt '
SIMON: Wall-ace though ? Page 81
MALCOLM: You are being portrayed as the biggest twat in Northamptonshire , and that 's going some .
TOBY: It is just a wall , Malcolm .
MALCOLM: Listen , my little stem cell , I do n't want to be dealing with this either , okay ? I 've got bigger fucking fish to fry , elieve me . I 'm rolling blue whales in eadcrumbs at the moment . I 'm giving this to Jamie .
SIMON: Oh great . The crossest man in Scotland . Jamie enters , holding another local rag .
JAMIE: Well , if it is n't Humpty-Numpty
SIMON: What is this , surround bollocking ?
JAMIE: With respect , I have n't finished . If it is n't Humpty-Numpty , sitting on top of a collapsing wall like some clueless egg- cunt .
SIMON: Hi Jamie .
TOBY: Hello .
JAMIE: Okay , that 's enough of the fucking Oxbridge pleasantries .
TOBY: How is saying `` hello '' a
JAMIE: Shut it , Love , Actually , or I 'll hole- punch your face .
MALCOLM: Right , I 'm off to deal with the fate of the planet , okay ? Simon , Toby and Jamie look at him . Page 82
JAMIE: You know me , Malcy , kid gloves . Made from real kids . Malcolm leaves . An awkward beat .
SIMON: A walrus ? I 'm not fat . I do n't even have a moustache .
TOBY: Lookwe hired some builders . They did n't turn up when they said they would .
JAMIE: They 're builders . What did you expect ? ! Have you ever seen a film where the hero is a builder ? No . Because they never turn up in the fucking nick of time.That 's why you never see a superhero with a hod .
SIMON: This is all gettingthis is a really stressful job , you know that ?
JUDY: Oh come on , you 're not a brain surgeon , you 're not a snooker player
SIMON: I do n't want to back a war , Judy . Page 83
JUDY: Oh . Right . A beat .
SIMON: Look , drop some hints , put some nods and winks out there , that I 'm toying with esignation . Yeah ? See if the PM reacts . See how it plays .
JUDY: Put out some winks ?
SIMON: And nods .
JUDY: Big nods ?
SIMON: No , no , just sort of That sort of size nod . Judy nods .
JUDY: No , I was just nodding normally to say I understood the need for a small nod .
SIMON: Oh . Good . They head in .
MALCOLM: So , my lovely friends , bottom line
MICHAEL: I hate that phrase . We 're not in etailing
MALCOLM: Sorry Michael , I promise never to use it again .
SIMON: What the fuck , Malcolm . This is all going to spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war . We fight people , and kill them , and our kids get killed , and that 's exactly the sort of thing I did n't want to do when I went into politics . That 's the opposite of what I want to be doing .
MALCOLM: That 's why you 've got to stay in Government . In here you can influence things , delay things . Out there you 're just another mad shouty fucker people do n't want to make eye-contact with . Remember Mary ? She took a stand ove Health . Everyone decided she was mental .
SIMON: Only because the Sun showed a photo of her with wide eyes and her head on a cow .
MALCOLM: I found that a very powerful image . Look , the Prime Minister of this country is not a Viking . He does n't drink blood , he does n't go round biting tramps . He does n't go to Chequers at the weekend fo a bit of light raping and a pub lunch .
SIMON: I know the Prime Minister is n't a Viking , Malcolm .
MALCOLM: Unlike me , the man abhors physical violence .
MOR E: Page 85
SIMON: Where 's the intelligence ? Where 's the hard evidence ?
MALCOLM: Listen , We 've got evidence harder than a diamond dildo . We have intelligence so deep and hard it would fucking puncture your kidneys.There 's an informant , ` Ice Man ' , OK ? The stuff he 's giving us ? It 'll make your blood run cold . And clot . You insides will turn to black pudding . now , certain box-lickers are sitting on it . But you 're going to see it , ecause the PM regards you as a key player now . Judy 's mobile goes .
JUDY: Judy Molloy ? Ten minutes . Thanks . Prime Minister wants to speak to you in ten minutes , Simon . He want you to go the
MALCOLM: See- you 're A-list now . You 're a Kennedy . In the VIP lounge , with the gold card and the complimentary drinks and the hard-on . Malcolm leaves . A beat .
SIMON: Show me the evidence , Malcolm , that 's my fucking bottom line .
JUDY: So do you still wantnods and winks ?
MICHAEL: Cheers everyone . Here 's to surviving another day . They clink glasses .
JUDY: My theory is Malcolm built Jamie in a la out of bits of old psychopath .
TOBY: Hello ladies .
SUZY: And gentleman .
TOBY: Hello ladies . I 'm just going to -
MICHAEL: Oh . Lovely . I think we could have anothe ottle of Sancerre .
TOBY: Great .
SUZY: If you can afford it .
JUDY: If you can get served at the bar .
SUZY: Fucking hell . Here we go again . Fucking arsehole .
MICHAEL: You 're kidding ? What 's it say ? Woah ! Suzy shows the phone to Judy .
JUDY: What a twat . What are you doing ? Are you replying ? Page 87
TOBY: Yeah I would n't want to meet Jamie in a dark alley . Or a bright alley . The whole thing of just being in an alley with him would be scary , regardless of the lighting . Suzy cuts in .
SUZY: You 've got a text .
TOBY: Oh yeah . It 's just Rob about football .
SUZY: So , Liza . You shagged her ?
TOBY: What ? No .
SUZY: Did you know my flakey boyfriend has been getting his flakey end away ?
JUDY: I do n't know anything about his flakey end .
TOBY: Could we not talk about accusations and , health issues , in the pub ?
JUDY: I should go .
SUZY: You have n't finished your drink .
JUDY: No . I mainly have .
SUZY: Why did you do it ?
TOBY: I do n't know , it was a weird , intense time over there . It wasmaybe , subconsciously , I do n't know , it was a kind of last ditch attempt to stop this , awfulwar . Page 88
MICHAEL: That 's classic . That 's definitely going in the memoirs .
SUZY: You had sex because of the war ?
TOBY: In the broad sense . Sorry , can you stop doing that ? Can we go somewhere where they 're are n't enormous children eating snacks ?
JUDY: I should go .
SUZY: Actually I 'll go . She goes . Toby goes after her .
MICHAEL: Shall we stay ?
JUDY: I should go . I 've got a long walk ahead of me . But that 'll keep me going .
TOBY: What the fuck is he doing here ?
SUZY: What ? ! What the fuck are you doing here ?
TOBY: Well I live here .
SUZY: No you do n't actually . I 'll go make that tea . Suzy and Toby go into the kitchen .
TOBY: Well , if I 'm leaving , I 'm taking my brie .
MOR E: Page 89
SUZY: Do n't forget your hydrocortisone .
TOBY: You putting this in your memoirs as well ?
MICHAEL: I should go .
SUZY: No , it 's fine . Stay .
TOBY: Where 's my needlecord jacket ?
SUZY: Your geography teacher 's jacket ?
MICHAEL: That 's not how you fold .
TOBY: Michael , this is one of the more humiliating moments of my life . I can pack a bag .
MICHAEL: The key to travelling is packing .
TOBY: I 'm not going to fucking Fiji Michael , I 'm being chucked out of my house .
MICHAEL: It 'll save time the other end .
TOBY: There is no other end .
SUZY: Has she got big tits ?
TOBY: Massive . Enormous . You can see them on Google Earth . They 've got their own postcode .
SUZY: Okay .
TOBY: Look , Suzy , this is probably going to sound odd under the circumstances .
SUZY: Quickie ?
TOBY: No . Thank you . But no . It 's about Liza .
SUZY: Oh good tell me more , tell me more about her tits .
TOBY: Listen , Suze , Liza wrote a paper , Pwip- Pip . I think , if it got leaked , it could stop the war . He holds out the memory stick .
MICHAEL: Good tactic . Get earnest . I tried that with the wife . Did n't work .
SUZY: You are such a fucking coward , you know that ? And this is what ? A make up leak ?
TOBY: Does such a thing exist ? Page 91
SUZY: Toby , take your rubbish clothes and you ack issues of Mojo , your flute , and your eighth of dope and leave me the fuck alone .
SIMON: Should I resign ? I 've floated that I might , when I thought I would n't , so it 'll look convincing if I did . I mean , do you think , is it braver to just resign and say , ` No , no war ' ?
JUDY: Yes .
SIMON: Or is it actually braver to say , ` I do n't agree , but I 'm going to grit my teeth and get on with it ? ' Is the really brave thing actually doing what you do n't elieve ?
JUDY: No .
TOBY: Though maybe ? What 's brave about doing the ` right thing ' ? Nothing . Doing the wrong thing is braver . In a way . I mean , you know , wars sometimes work . The War of Independence , that worked . For the Americans . Second World War . That was a good idea . I mean not a good idea but
SIMON: I know what you mean . And the Crimean Wa we got nurses out of that .
TOBY: Nurses are good .
SIMON: Exactly . Soright . Exactly .
JUDY: So you 're not resigning ? Page 92
SIMON: No , I.. where 's Malcolm ?
TOBY: You want hookers ? You like hooky fucky ?
SIMON: I want to talk about the resigning thing .
TOBY: Still ?
SIMON: But with you and not her . She has this air of moral righteousness that inhibits you from saying anything morally wrong .
MALCOLM: So . The wires are all currently reporting that you 're going to resign from government over the war .
SIMON: What ? That was n't supposed to get outside .
MALCOLM: Yeah well it is outside . It 's lurking outside like a big hairy rapist at a coach station . Simon looks to Toby for help .
SIR JONATHAN: Hello , gentlemen , Sir Jonathan Tutt . This is it . The United Nations .
SIMON: It 's all a bit ` blurrrgh ' , is n't it ?
JUDY: It could do with a few more scatte cushions and a bit less asbestos .
SIR JONATHAN: I do n't know what you were expecting Jacobean panelling perhaps , arabesques of stonework tracery great fountains
MALCOLM: It 's a shithole . It looks like a hospice for robots . They pass a big office .
SIR JONATHAN: Linton Barwick is in there . Karen Clark is there . You 're right here . Sir Jonathan shows them to their office .
MALCOLM: Nibbles ? Who still says nibbles ?
TOBY: Fuck the nibbles , what was with the homoerotic tension ? Malcolm gets a call . Page 94
MALCOLM: Jamie . Hello ? He looks at his phone .
JAMIE: Okay , your phone 's off , which means you 've been shot dead by a fat American , ut there 's been a fucktastrophe . Someone 's leaked Liza Weld 's Pwip Pip paper to the BBC . I reckon it 'll be on the Six O'Clock news here , one o'clock your time , so it 's going to fist you fucking vote apart . Missing you loads , pwip-pip , toodle-oo !
MALCOLM: Okay Jamie , two jobs . One find the Pwip Pip leaker and kill them . That 's one job . Job one has two parts . Job two stop Pwip Pip coming out . Sow enough seeds of fea and doubt that the fat arses at the BBC dither till after the vote , okay ? Afte the vote Enola Gay is cleared for take- off and everything is groovy . I love you .
SIR JONATHAN: Hm ?
MALCOLM: Was it you ?
SIMON: No , what ? No .
MALCOLM: But you know what I 'm talking about ?
SIMON: No , but whatever it was I did n't do it .
MALCOLM: Was it you , The-Baby-From-Eraserhead ?
TOBY: No .
MALCOLM: So it must have been you Woman from The Crying Game ?
JUDY: It was n't me . You 've really got it in fo me have n't you ?
MALCOLM: Someone 's dropped a bollock in the noodles and I reckon it was you .
JUDY: We 've done this all before . You accused me of leaking last time and it was n't me .
MALCOLM: Yeah well I know you did n't leak last time . But what I reckon is you got so pissy about being accused , you leaked this time .
TOBY: Yeah . Yeah , that does sound possible .
JUDY: Look Springer Spaniel , keep your little wet nose out alright ? Page 96
TOBY: I 'm just saying psychologically speaking that sounds plausible - that you might uild up a resentment and then pay it off in some underhand way . That 's just something I 've observed .
MALCOLM: Come on , Baldermort , I need a word .
TOBY: Sorry about that - it 's just something I 've observed .
JUDY: Wanker . It 's okay . It 's fine . It 's probably just the stress of this awful , awful war . Malcolm drags the ambassador into a corner .
MALCOLM: We 're in a new reality now and You 've got to speed things up .
SIR JONATHAN: What things ? Speed up what ?
MALCOLM: The debate . It needs to start at eleven o'clock , not one thirty .
SIR JONATHAN: Hehe . Can I perhaps briefly explain the way the process works ? And why that is n't possible ? You see through that door there are a number of secretariats that are currently doing what we call the washing up now
MALCOLM: Just fucking do it , fishlips . Otherwise you 'll find yourself in some medieval warzone in the Caucasus with your arse in the air , trying to persuade a group of men in balaclavas that sustained sexual violence is not the way forward . Page 97
SIR JONATHAN: No , it ca n't be . I mean it could be done , it just ca n't .
MALCOLM: Then I 'll do it . They 're through there ?
SIR JONATHAN: Yes but you ca n't go in , that would be a serious breach of protocol
MALCOLM: Then you do it . Get in there . He is almost man-handling him in .
SIR JONATHAN: I 'm not dancing with you Malcolm .
MALCOLM: I 'm leading , look follow my lead .
SIR JONATHAN: You 're not dancing me into the secretariat !
MALCOLM: Where 's the intel ? Are you sure you 're working as hard as me ? Cos I 'm sweating spinal fluid here . I 'm a husk .
MILLER: You get everything you need ?
MALCOLM: Oh yeah I think so . Thanks . Oh , Whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment General Flintstone . Was it you ? Did you leak Pwip Pip ? I know you ca n't fire a gun , but can you use a fax ?
MILLER: No , see , because I 'm upfront about what I do . I do n't creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing othe people 's dirty work . Page 98
MALCOLM: I 'm doing my own work . I 'm doing my job .
MILLER: Uh-hu . I think you 're doing Linton 's dirty work . I think you 're his English itch and if I walked into your hotel oom tonight I 'd find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out the back of you .
MALCOLM: Oooo . Tough talk from the armchai General . What you going to do ? Throw a cushion at me ? Put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why do n't you ?
GENERAL MILLER: Listen , Tucker , you may be some scary poodlefucker back in London , but here ? You know what you look like ? A fucking squeezed dick . You got a blue vein unning all the way up to your temple there . That 's where I 'd put the fucking ullet . But I 'd stand well back . You look like you 'd be a squirter .
MALCOLM: Have you ever even killed anybody ? Really ?
GENERAL MILLER: Yep .
MALCOLM: Falling asleep on someone does n't count .
GENERAL MILLER: I 've done my share . How many you kill , pussy drip ?
MALCOLM: Personally , I prefer maiming .
GENERAL MILLER: Go on , tough guy , take a swing at me . I 'll smack you so fucking hard you 'll be shitting teeth .
MALCOLM: Go ahead . I can see the headlines now . 'Peace-Loving General Starts Fight In UN , Swiss Intervene ' . I do n't know , I 'm no expert on spin but could that hurt you career ? Page 99
SIR JONATHAN: Hello everyone . I was wondering if I might suggest a cheeky early vote ? Bit of an adventure . Maybe , we could knock off early , go for a drink ? Ha . I 'm kidding . Or am I ? No , I am .
KAREN: There it is . Simon 's going . Everyone 's saying he 's going . Simon passes their open door .
GENERAL MILLER: Simon ! There he is ! Simon . This is great shit . I was n't sure you had the nerve . You 're resigning ?
SIMON: Ah okay . They 're not running with that ? I have not said that .
GENERAL MILLER: You 're not resigning ?
KAREN: You 're still playing the hawk ?
SIMON: It 's much subtler than that . It 's nuanced . I 'm playing a much cleverer game than that . I 'm a fake hawk . Page 100
GENERAL MILLER: I 'm sorry ?
SIMON: Fake hawk .
GENERAL MILLER: You 're a fake hawk ? You 're a fucking idiot . You 're not a fake idiot are you . Karen and Miller go into a confab .
KAREN: We could just tell the press he 's going anyway . Say he 's confirmed to us that he 's resigning .
SIMON: Sorry ?
GENERAL MILLER: I second that .
SIMON: What ? You ca n't .
GENERAL MILLER: Do we announce it before or after the vote ?
KAREN: During . Then he ca n't do anything about it .
GENERAL MILLER: Great . That 's decided then .
SIMON: No . No it 's bloody not . I 'm - me . You 're not me . I decide about all the main things about me , okay ? Not you . Me .
GENERAL MILLER: No . No Simon . I 'm afraid not . Not on this one . This is too big for you .
KAREN: Be realistic . You 're being used . We all are . The one thing we can do now to influence things is to resign . Sacrifice ourselves . That 's our only weapon . Page 101
SIMON: Like a suicide bomber ?
GENERAL MILLER: No , not like a suicide bomber . A suicide omber gets to make a decision .
TOBY: Listen , I 'm really sorry about Suzy and the texting and
LIZA: Good . Thanks . Do you have figures there for CFE minimum requirements ?
TOBY: Er ?
LIZA: Conventional Forces in Europe .
TOBY: Sure . I 'll just dig that out . Look it was a very special evening for me and
LIZA: Sorry ? What ? You 're mumbling .
TOBY: I just wandered if tonight when all this shit is over we could n't - you know . You 're single . I 'm single now . You 're a woman . I 'm not .
LIZA: You want to have sex again ?
TOBY: It 's not a terrible idea is it ? One more . For the Gipper ?
LIZA: You know what a douchbag is Toby ? You 're a douchbag on fucking wheels . Page 102
TOBY: Thanks . That was short and sweet . Well , short and sour .
JUDY: You okay ?
SIMON: I 'm thinking of becoming a suicide omber .
JUDY: That 's certainly a very powerful way of getting your point across . He pulls out some mints .
SIMON: Would you like a mint ?
JUDY: I 'm okay thanks . Are you thinking to overdose on mints ? Because Simon eats a mint .
SIMON: Do you like me Judy ?
JUDY: You 're my boss .
SIMON: Yeah , but do you actually like me . A beat .
JUDY: Sure . Look , I 'll leave you to you thoughts . Page 103
SIMON: I have n't got any thoughts . I 'm just staring vacantly into space while a distant voice in the back of my head goes `` oh shit '' like a car alarm in the middle of the night .
JAMIE: Was it you ?
MICHAEL: Sorry ?
JAMIE: Not you . I know it was n't you , you 're too fucking horny for your Knighthood .
TO SUZY: Was it you ?
SUZY: Was what me ?
JAMIE: Was it fucking you ! ? Answer the question !
MICHAEL: She ca n't very well answer the question if you do n't tell her what it is , can she ?
JAMIE: Fuck off to your room , Count of Cunty Cristo , this is between me and her . You leaked Liza Weld 's paper to the BBC . Tell me you leaked it .
SUZY: I did n't leak anything . I do n't know what you 're talking about .
JAMIE: You 're lying . You touched your nose . That 's what 's called a ` tell ' . You are lying . Page 104
SUZY: No I 'm not .
JAMIE: ` No I 'm not . ' That 's a tell as well . Classic . I know the leak came from here , from this fucking fax machine here .
MICHAEL: It was me .
JAMIE: Oh fuck off . Do n't come over all Spartacus now .
MICHAEL: I leaked it .
JAMIE: What ?
MICHAEL: I just sent it . I thought it was important so I sent it through .
JAMIE: Ok. See this fax machine ? That 's your career . I 'm pretty sure it 's fucked . Let me just check . Yeah , it is . Plus , breach of Official Secrets , so that 's fucking swannee . Maybe you can get a part time job in West End as a gentleman 's fluffer . Or whatever the fuck they call it these days . Jamie is heading off .
MICHAEL: Well , you know better to go out with a ang
JAMIE: No , no . I will not allow this to be a ang . This will be a whimper , a tiny pathetic whimper like a puppy being fucked by a big metal puppy-fucking machine . And they do exist , ` cos my gran 's got one . Jamie leaves .
MALCOLM: Honestly ? I have n't got it . We need more time .
SIMON: Just getting my mints . Page 106
MALCOLM: Okay , quick reality check , J Edga Fucking Hoover . I do n't work for you . You do n't tell me what to fucking do .
TOBY: We 've just heard the wall 's starting to collapse . A brick has fallen . That 's the news I 'm getting . More to follow . Both news and bricks . Linton laughs again .
SIMON: You 've been working for him ?
MALCOLM: It 's complicated , okay ? I 've been juggling a number of responsibilities .
SIMON: Okay , well , right , after the vote , I esign .
MALCOLM: Look . It 's too late now . Resigning . It 's not worth it . The horse has bolted . It 's out there getting shot now .
SIMON: I 'll see you later , Malcolm . Simon exits .
MALCOLM: If you repeat this to anyone I will pull your leg off , break it in two and sta you to death with your broken shin bone . Now go away . Toby leaves . Malcolm sits down , head in his hands .
TOBY: Suzy , how 's it going ? Has Jamie been ound ? Right Liza comes over .
LIZA: This is you , is n't it ?
TOBY: This is me , yes . And that 's you . I thought we had this worked out .
LIZA: I 've got something big lined up and you etter not have fucked it up for me . Liza leaves .
TOBY: Hello ? Oh hi , Paul . How 's it going ? No , yes , I know the wall is collapsing . I 'm as frustrated as you are mate .
JAMIE: Right , Frank and Nancy Sinatra . I 've got good news . You 're not fired . That 's great news , is n't it ?
MICHAEL: That sounds ominous .
JAMIE: He 's fucking delighted . We want to put Liza Weld 's Pwip Pip out there , properly . In the public domain . We just have to refine it a bit .
SUZY: Refine it ?
JAMIE: Take out the cons , change the name of the main informant .
MICHAEL: That 's a complete fabrication . Page 109
JAMIE: Changing his name does n't make a difference . The main source in there he 's not really called Ice Man , is he ? `` Mr and Mrs Man , you 've got a son , Ice . '' So we change it , to another name . Who 's the fuck with the fiddle ? The Fiddlefuck .
MICHAEL: This is Debussy , if that 's what you mean .
JAMIE: Okay , we 'll call him Debussy .
MICHAEL: No .
JAMIE: And then you 'll make a couple of othe changes . It 'll mean your fingerprints are on it , Mikey , but it 's the only way to save your job , you leaky fuck .
MICHAEL: It was n't me , Jamie , alright ? It was n't me . Do n't make me do this . Someone else must have come in and used the fax machine .
JAMIE: What ? Oh , that thing about your fax ? Do n't worry about that . I made that up . The paper was sent by e-mail . It ; s just , the fax machine was there and it ; s easie to kick .
MALCOLM: Yeah , BBC newsdesk please . Malcolm Tucker . Ben ? Hi , how you doing ? Yeah , well , I 'm hearing you 're preparing a story that we might not like .
TOBY: Can we stop running because my hands are eally rather badly burned now . They stop .
MALCOLM: I know it was you who leaked Linton 's Wa Committee .
TOBY: Oh ? Right . It was n't ?
MALCOLM: Are you telling me it was n't you ? Is that your proposition ? Is that want you want to say if I ask them to fly you to Diego Garcia and slip a hood over your head and carry out a cavity search ?
TOBY: I do n't actually recall . It was a busy time .
MALCOLM: That 's more like it . Soyou are now on probation . Okay ?
TOBY: Okay .
MALCOLM: You 're my guy now . I own you now . You 're my Kunte Kinte . Go and get your laptop . Toby goes .
SIR JONATHAN: Good , I 've been looking for you . I needed to tell you that by a huge personal effort huge I have managed to bring the vote forward by an hour and a half .
MALCOLM: Great . I need it delayed now .
SIR JONATHAN: Very funny . That is funny .
MALCOLM: By an hour , at least . Although I guess two and a half hours now , as you 've ought it forward .
SIR JONATHAN: No , I 'm sorry I 'm very sorry but I wo n't humiliate myself again .
MALCOLM: You do what I say or you can go and see if Belize are looking for a new ambassador but with a broken nose , one ollock , and a half-chewed cock .
SIR JONATHAN: Right . What can I say ? Page 112
JAMIE: This is nice is n't it ? Cosy . Away from prying eyes .
MICHAEL: So what 's this , your political wet-room ? Jamie 's phone goes .
MALCOLM: Is it up , have you got it up ?
JAMIE: Yeah it 's all fine .
MALCOLM: Okay , go to page nine , highlight that .
JAMIE: Go to page nine . Michael does .
MALCOLM: Highlight from that page to the end of the document .
JAMIE: Do you mean select ?
MALCOLM: I do n't know I do n't use these things .
JAMIE: Select page nine to the end of the document . Page 113
MICHAEL: The caveats ? Michael does it .
MALCOLM: Is it highlighted ?
JAMIE: You mean selected , yeah it 's selected .
MALCOLM: Okay , right , standby delete !
JAMIE: Delete !
MICHAEL: You ca n't just delete the arguments against the war . Michael stops what he 's doing .
MALCOLM: Messenger ! Get Messenger up !
JAMIE: Oh hang on Malc . Michael 's stopped moving . I think he 's crashed .
MALCOLM: Have you tried hitting him ? Give him a thump , that usually works .
JAMIE: Hang on , I think I might be able to use manual over-ride .
MALCOLM: Great . Now attach that to email . Page 114
JAMIE: Attach that to an email .
MALCOLM: Right , let 's find a printer . The Japanese , they 'll have one . They 've got everything .
TOBY: Where from ?
MALCOLM: I do n't fucking know . Do I look like I 've ever set foot in a stationary cupboard ? I do my shagging in five star hotels . Now go and find me a blue fucking folder . Pronto . Toby runs off .
LIZA: Really ?
CHAIR: Resolution 5977 is passed .
SIMON: Yup . That 's that then .
TOBY: `` That 's that then '' ? That 's your quote fo the ages is it ? Page 116
SIMON: What ?
TOBY: 'And I remember the moment war was declared . I turned to the Minister and he said `` That 's that , then . Anyone want a mint ? `` .
SIMON: Piss off , Toby .
BOB ADRIANO: Yes sir ! There were moments when it was a little hairy
JAMIE: Well done Michael . You did a good job . You did a really , really good job .
KAREN: So , I emailed my resignation ten minutes ago . Yours should come right after the President 's announcement , to have the iggest media impact . Page 117
GENERAL MILLER: I 've been thinking Karen . This has been the hardest fucking decision of my political life . I 'm not resigning .
KAREN: What the fuck George . Seriously ? You said that the war was intolerable and we 'd go together .
GENERAL MILLER: It is - it is intolerable . I still agree with myself about that . But I 've got to tolerate it . My loyalty is with the kids . At the end of the day I 'm a soldier .
KAREN: You 're not a soldier .
GENERAL MILLER: Look at the uniform , Karen . I 'm not a pastry chef . I have military commendations on my chest , not a little fucking label saying My Name Is George .
KAREN: You 're a politician . You live on canapes and white wine and you have three anecdotes you wheel out at every party and you scour the national papers fo mentions of your name . You 're a fucking politician .
GENERAL MILLER: I 'm still a soldier .
KAREN: When was the last time you shot a guy ?
GENERAL MILLER: What , if I have n't shot a guy in 15 years then I 'm not a soldier ? City hall do n't insist I bring along a fucking bullet- idden corpse every five years to renew my soldier licence .
KAREN: You know this is an unnecessary war . It 's a war you do n't believe in . Show me some alls , George .
GENERAL MILLER: I know I 've got balls , I do n't need to show them to you . Page 118
KAREN: Oh sure , It just so happens they 're sitting pretty in a pair of Egyptian cotton Ralph Lauren shorts on a Government salary .
GENERAL MILLER: Do n't talk about my fucking balls that way . My balls have been around . My balls have got balls .
KAREN: Come on Chad , let 's leave the General and his over-stuffed scrotum . We 're going to draft our resignation announcements . Karen turns away from him .
CHAD: Er , I might , stay with the General actually Karen , if that 's okay ? If he 's staying I might stay with him and see what assistance I can furnish .
KAREN: Okay . General Shrek and his faithful talking donkey . She goes .
GENERAL MILLER: This takes balls Karen .
CHAD: You 've got balls Sir . Anyone can see you 've got big balls . They 're two-thirds of a snowman .
GENERAL MILLER: Get the fuck away from me . Miller walks off .
CHAD: Okay . This was not the plan .
SIMON: No , you 're right . I am a piss-brain . That 's the perfect word , Mr Michaelson . Your mother came up with it ? Well congratulate her from me . I am a piss- ain for letting this happen . Page 119
MALCOLM: Simon , look , mate . Listen to me . You still do n't need to resign .
SIMON: No . I 'm going to resign , Malcolm . In a hour . You ca n't stop me now . Toby comes over .
TOBY: Boss ?
SIMON: God , and that 's NEWS . Ridiculous , is n't it ?
MALCOLM: It 's nor Ridiculous . You 're fired .
SIMON: What ?
MALCOLM: The wall . It 's just not tolerable .
SIMON: It 's just a fucking wall .
MALCOLM: Look at this . Give me the paper . He 's my new boy . I 'm just breaking him in .
TOBY: Here . Page 120
MALCOLM: The Telegraph has a cartoon of you crushed underneath the Great Wall Of China , suggesting you are the only political fuck-up visible from space . Look at this . No one could survive this . The PM is very clear on this - you 're sacked , over the wall .
SIMON: No .
MALCOLM: Yes .
SIMON: You have n't even - spoken to the Prime Minister .
MALCOLM: Yes I have .
SIMON: You fucking have n't I 've been right here .
MALCOLM: I have spoken to the Prime Minister . Whether it has happened or not is irrelevant . It is true . As soon as I heard about the wall , I spoke to him and he decided you had to go .
SIMON: I 'm not going quietly .
MALCOLM: Yeah well if you try to turn this into some anti-war protest , you can expect your ` mountain of conflict ' soundbite to e everywhere from ringtones to a fucking dance mix on YouTube . I will marshall all the forces of media darkness to hound you to an assisted suicide .
TOBY: Hi . General ? Look I realise this is a slightly strange time to say this , but I just want to say how much I admire
GENERAL MILLER: Go fuck yoursefl , Frodo .
TOBY: Great . Lovely
ROZ: Right , I 've got a selection of quotes fo you , they 're all local firms and none of them is very well respected . Now , this sceptic tank is also rearing it 's pooy head again too . Simon looks zonked with boredom .
MOR E: Page 122
MALCOLM: Ah , here they are . Minister . Elizabeth . Welcome aboard .
MINISTER: Thanks Malcolm . Looking forward to it . War seems to be going ` great guns ' at the moment .
MALCOLM: Ah , cheeky ! Let me take you out for an expensive lunch , roast swan and all the trimmings , and I 'll bring you up to speed on the whole Middle East situation .
MINISTER: Are you twisting my arm already ?
MALCOLM: Aye , but in a friendly , non-breaky way . Watch your step there . There 's still lood on the deck .
ADVISOR: Hi I 'm Danny . Dan . I 'm Elizabeth 's chief advisor .
JUDY: Judy Molloy . Senior Press -
ADVISOR: Have I got a desk ?
JUDY: Yes , it 's that one there .
SHOOTING SCRIPT: FADE IN
ATTENDANT: He was delirious . But he asked fo you by name . And Show him .
SECURITY GUARD: He was carrying nothing but this
COBB: A bacteria ? A virus ?
ARTHUR: What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-
COBB: An idea . Saito looks at Cobb , curious .
SAITO: But surely-to forget ?
COBB: Information , yes . But an idea ? Fully formed , understood ? That sticks In there , somewhere .
SAITO: For someone like you to steal ?
ARTHUR: Yes . In the dream state , conscious defenses are lowered and you thoughts become vulnerable to theft . It 's called extraction .
COBB: But , Mr. Saito , we can train you subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor .
SAITO: How can you do that ?
COBB: Because I am the most skilled extractor . I know how to search your mind and find your secrets . I know the tricks , and I can teach them to your subconscious so that even when you 're asleep , your guard is never down . Cobb leans forwards . Holding Saito 's gaze .
SAITO: Gentlemen . Enjoy your evening as I consider your proposal .
ARTHUR: He knows .
COBB: I can get it here . The information 's in the safe- he looked right at it when I mentioned secrets .
ARTHUR: What 's she doing here , Cobb ?
COBB: You just get to your room . I 'll take care of the rest .
ARTHUR: See that you do . We 're here to work .
MAL: If I jumped , would I survive ?
COBB: With a clean dive , perhaps . Mal , why are you here ? She turns to look at him . Amused .
MAL: I thought you might be missing me She smiles . He leans in , mesmerized .
COBB: I am . But I ca n't trust you anymore . She stares up at him , inviting .
MAL: So what ?
COBB: Actually , Mr. Saito is partial to postwar British painters .
MAL: Tell me Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS .
COBB: You ca n't imagine .
MAL: What 're you doing ? Cobb tosses the rope out-
COBB: Getting some air .
MAL: The gun , Dom .
SAITO: Now the envelope , Mr. Cobb .
COBB: Did she tell you , or have you known all along ?
SAITO: That you 're here to steal from me ? Or that we 're actually asleep ? Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look .
COBB: No point threatening him in a dream .
MAL: That depends on what you 're threatening . Killing him would just wake him up but pain ? Pain is in the mind
NASH: What 're you doing ? ! It 's too soon-
ARTHUR: I know ! We have to reconnect the loop before they wake up !
MAL: He was close . Very close .
SAITO: Stop him !
ARTHUR: I 'm not going to make it ! Wake Cobb !
NASH: He wo n't wake !
ARTHUR: Dunk him !
COBB: You came prepared .
SAITO: I bring the gun because not even my head of security knows this apartment . How did you find it ?
COBB: Hard for a man in your position to keep a love nest totally secret particularly when there 's a married woman involved .
SAITO: She would never
COBB: And yet , here we are . Saito is silent .
SAITO: You got what you came for .
COBB: Not quite . The key piece of information was n't there , was it , Mr. Saito ?
ARTHUR: They 're getting closer , Cobb .
COBB: You held something back because you knew what we were up to
SAITO: An audition .
COBB: Audition for what ?
SAITO: It does n't matter . You failed .
COBB: I extracted all the information you had in there .
SAITO: But your deception was readily apparent . And we-
COBB: You know the corporation who hired us wo n't accept failure . We wo n't last two days
ARTHUR: Come on , Cobb .
COBB: So now I have to do this the old- fashioned way-
SAITO: I 've always hated this carpet . Cobb 's eyes flick to the carpet and back .
TODASHI: How 'd it go ?
ARTHUR: Not good .
SAITO: A dream within a dream-I 'm impressed .
NASH: Ah , yes , but you see , Mr. Saito- Saito turns to Nash-
COBB: We 're not in your dream-
NASH: We 're in mine .
ARTHUR: How could you get the carpet wrong ? !
NASH: It was n't my fault !
ARTHUR: You 're the architect-
NASH: I did n't know he was going to ru his damn cheek on it ! Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash .
COBB: Lets go .
ARTHUR: And you-what the hell was all that ?
COBB: I had it under control .
ARTHUR: I 'd hate to see out of control-
COBB: There 's no time for this-I 'm getting off at Kyoto .
ARTHUR: Why ? He 's not gon na search every compartment .
COBB: I ca n't stand trains . Arthur moves to the briefcase . Turns a dial .
ARTHUR: I can keep him under for one minute-
COBB: Every man for himself .
JAMES: Daddy ?
COBB: Yes ? JAMES Is Mommy with you ?
ARTHUR: Our ride 's on the roof .
COBB: Yeah , why ?
ARTHUR: Down in the dream Mal showing up like that
COBB: Yeah . I 'm sorry about your leg .
ARTHUR: It 's getting worse , is n't it ?
COBB: One apology 's all you 're getting , Arthur . Now , where 's Nash ?
ARTHUR: Has n't shown . Wan na wait ?
COBB: We were supposed to deliver Saito 's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago . By now they know we failed . Time to disappear .
ARTHUR: Where will you go ?
COBB: Buenos Aires . I can lie low there . Maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down . You ?
ARTHUR: Stateside .
COBB: ) 'Course . Send my regards . Arthur looks at Cobb . Nods . Sympathetic .
SAITO: He sold you out . Thought to come to me and bargain for his life Saito 's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN .
COBB: That 's not how I deal with things .
SAITO: Would you work with him again ?
COBB: What will you do to him ?
SAITO: Nothing . But I ca n't speak for you friends from Cobol Engineering . Saito looks out at the city slipping by .
COBB: What do you want from us ?
SAITO: Inception .
ARTHUR: Of course not .
SAITO: If you can steal an idea from someone 's mind , why ca n't you plant one there instead ?
ARTHUR: Okay , here 's planting an idea I say to you , `` Do n't think about elephants . ''
SAITO: Elephants .
ARTHUR: Right . But it 's not your idea ecause you know I gave it to you .
SAITO: You could plant it subconsciously-
ARTHUR: The subject 's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea . True inspiration is impossible to fake .
COBB: No , it is n't .
SAITO: Can you do it ?
COBB: I wo n't do it .
SAITO: In exchange , I 'll give you the information you were paid to steal .
COBB: Are you giving me a choice ? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol .
SAITO: Then you do have a choice .
COBB: And I choose to leave .
SAITO: Tell the crew where you want to go , they 'll file the plan en route .
COBB: You ca n't fix that . Nobody could .
SAITO: Just like inception . Cobb considers this . Arthur touches his arm .
ARTHUR: Cobb , come on-
COBB: How complex is the idea ?
SAITO: Simple enough .
COBB: No idea 's simple when you have to plant it in someone else 's mind .
SAITO: My main competitor is an old man in poor health . His son will soon inherit control of the corporation . I need him to decide to break up his father 's empire . Against his own self-interest .
ARTHUR: Cobb , we should walk away from this .
COBB: If I were to do it . If I could do it how do I know you can deliver ?
SAITO: You do n't . But I can . So do you want to take a leap of faith , o ecome an old man , filled with egret , waiting to die alone ? Cobb looks at Saito . Barely nods .
ARTHUR: I know how much you want to go home-
COBB: No , you do n't .
ARTHUR: But this ca n't be done .
COBB: It can . You just have to go deep enough .
ARTHUR: You do n't know that ! -
COBB: I 've done it before .
ARTHUR: Did it work ?
COBB: Yes .
ARTHUR: Who did you do it to ? Cobb looks at Arthur . Closed . Arthur shrugs .
COBB: We 're going to need a new architect .
MILES: No space to think in that broom cupboard . Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows .
COBB: Extradition between France and the U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare .
MILES: I think they 'd find a way to make it work in your case . Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag .
COBB: Can you take these back for the kids ?
MILES: It 'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father .
COBB: I know . I thought you could talk to Marie about bringing them on vacation . Somewhere I could meet-
MILES: Why would she listen to me ?
COBB: You were married for twenty years .
MILES: She blames me as much as you .
COBB: Does n't she understand that my kids need me ?
MILES: Yes , she does . We all do . Go back and face the music , Dom . Explain what Mal did .
COBB: Be realistic , Stephen . They 'd neve understand- they 'd lock me up and throwaway the key . Or worse .
MILES: You think what you 're doing now is helping your case ?
COBB: Lawyers do n't pay for themselves . This is what I have . This is what you taught me .
MILES: I never taught you to be a thief .
COBB: No , you taught me to navigate othe people 's minds . But after what happened with Mal there were n't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill . Miles looks at Cobb .
MILES: Why did you come here , Dom ? Cobb shifts slightly .
COBB: I found a way home . A job . Fo powerful people . If I pull it off , I can get back to my family . But I need help . Miles realizes something .
MILES: My God . You 're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best .
COBB: If you have someone good enough , you have to let them decide fo themselves . You know what I 'm offering-
MILES: Money ?
COBB: No , not just money the chance to uild cathedrals , entire cities- things that have never existed , things that could n't exist in the eal world
MILES: Everybody dreams , Cobb . Architects are supposed to make those dreams eal .
COBB: That 's not what you used to say . You told me that in the real world I 'd be building attic conversions and gas stations . You said that if I mastered the dream-share I 'd have a whole new way of creating and showing people my creations . You told me it would free me . Miles looks at Cobb , sad .
MILES: And I 'm sorry . I was wrong .
COBB: No , you were n't . Your vision was a vision of pure creativity . It 's where we took it that was wrong .
MILES: And now you want me to let someone else follow you into fantasy .
COBB: They wo n't actually come on the job , they 'll just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers .
MILES: Design them yourself .
COBB: Mal wo n't let me . Miles looks at Cobb . Appalled .
MILES: Come back to reality , Dom . Please .
COBB: You want to know what 's real , Stephen ? Your grandchildren waiting for their dad to come back .
COBB: I would n't be standing here if there were any other way . I can get home . But I need an architect who 's as good as I was . Miles looks Cobb in the eye . Decides .
MILES: I 've got someone better .
ARIADNE: Pleased to meet you .
MILES: If you have a few moments , Mr. Co has a job offer to discuss with you .
ARIADNE: A work placement ?
COBB: ( smiles Not exactly .
ARIADNE: Are n't you going to tell me anything ?
COBB: Before I describe the job , I have to know you could do it .
ARIADNE: Why ?
COBB: It 's not , strictly speaking , legal . Ariadne raises her eyebrows .
ARIADNE: Such as ?
COBB: How do you imagine a building ? You consciously create each aspect , puzzling over it in stages But sometimes , when your imagination flies-
ARIADNE: I 'm discovering it .
COBB: Exactly . Genuine inspiration .
ARIADNE: How ?
COBB: By taking over the creating part .
ARIADNE: But are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life ?
COBB: While we 're in there , We do n't want him to realize he 's dreaming .
ARIADNE: How could I ever get enough detail to Convince him that it 's real ?
COBB: Our dreams reel real while we 're in them . It 's only when we wake up we ealize things were strange , Ariadne gestures around them-
ARIADNE: But all the textures of real life- the stone , the fabric . cars people your mind ca n't create all this .
COBB: It does . Every time you dream . Let me ask you a question You neve emember the beginning of you dreams , do you ? You just turn up in the middle of what 's going on .
ARIADNE: I guess .
COBB: So how did we end up at this estaurant ?
ARIADNE: We came here from Ariadne trails off , confused .
COBB: How did we get here ? Where are we ?
ARIADNE: Oh my God . We 're dreaming . Cobb nods . The RUMBLE is BUILDING .
COBB: Stay calm . We 're actually asleep in the workshop . This is your first lesson in shared dreaming , emember ?
ARIADNE: If it 's just a dream , why are you covering your-
COBB: And a face full of glass hurts like hell , does n't it ? While we 're in it , it 's real .
ARTHUR: That 's why the military developed dream sharing-a training program where soldiers could strangle , sta and shoot each other , then wake up .
ARIADNE: How did architects get involved ?
COBB: Someone had to design the dreams . Let 's go another five minutes-
ARIADNE: We were only asleep for five minutes ? We talked for an hour at least
COBB: When you dream , your mind functions more quickly , so time seems to pass more slowly .
ARTHUR: Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream .
COBB: Let 's see how much trouble you can cause in five minutes . And we-
ARIADNE: Who are the people ?
COBB: They 're projections of my subconscious .
ARIADNE: Yours ?
COBB: Sure-you are the dreamer , I am the subject . My subconscious populates your world . That 's one way we get at a subject 's thoughts-his mind creates the people , so we can literally talk to his subconscious .
ARIADNE: How else do you do it ?
COBB: Architecture . Build a bank vault o a jail , something secure , and the subject 's mind will fill it with information he 's trying to protect .
ARIADNE: Then you break in and steal it .
COBB: Exactly . Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street .
ARIADNE: I love the concrete sense of things- Real weight , you know ? I thought a dream space would be all about the visual , but it 's the feel of things . Question is , what happens as you start to mess with physics
COBB: Yes . It is .
ARIADNE: Why are they looking at me ?
COBB: Because you 're changing things . My subconscious feels that someone else is creating the world . The more you change things , the quicke the projections converge on you .
ARIADNE: Converge ?
COBB: They feel the foreign nature of the dreamer , and attack-like white lood cells fighting an infection .
ARIADNE: They 're going to attack us ?
COBB: Just you , actually .
ARIADNE: Mind telling your subconscious to take it easy ?
COBB: That 's why it 's called subconscious . I do n't control it .
ARIADNE: I cross it every day on my way to the college .
COBB: Never recreate places from you memory . Always imagine new places .
ARIADNE: You have to draw from what you know-
COBB: Use pieces-a streetlamp , phonebooths , a type of brick-not whole areas .
ARIADNE: Why not ?
COBB: Because building dreams out of you own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what 's real and what 's a dream .
ARIADNE: Did that happen to you ?
COBB: Look , this is n't about me-
ARIADNE: Is that why you need me to build your dreams ?
COBB: Leave her alone-
ARIADNE: Wake me up , Cobb . As Mal walks , she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-
COBB: Mal , no !
ARIADNE: Wake me up !
ARTHUR: It 's okay .
ARIADNE: Why could n't I wake ?
ARTHUR: The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die .
COBB: She 'll need a totem .
ARIADNE: What ?
ARTHUR: Some kind of personal icon . A small object that you can always have with you , and that no one else knows ,
ARIADNE: That 's some subconscious you 've got , Cobb . She 's a real charmer !
ARTHUR: Sounds like you 've met Mrs. Cobb .
ARIADNE: She 's his wife ? Arthur nods , pulling off Ariadne 's tubes .
ARTHUR: So . A totem . You need something small , potentially heavy
ARIADNE: Like a coin ?
ARTHUR: Too common . You need something that has a weight or movement that only you know .
ARIADNE: What 's yours ? Arthur holds out a DIE .
ARTHUR: A loaded die .
ARIADNE: Why ?
ARTHUR: So when you examine your totem
ARIADNE: That 's not an issue for me .
ARTHUR: Why not ?
ARIADNE: Arthur , maybe you ca n't see what 's going on , maybe you do n't want to . But Cobb 's got problems he 's tried to bury down there . I 'm not going to open my mind to someone like that . Ariadne gets to her feet . Walks away .
COBB: I 've never seen anyone pick it up so fast . And one reality wo n't be enough for her now . When she comes ack , get her building mazes .
ARTHUR: Where will you be ?
COBB: I 've got to talk to Eames .
ARTHUR: Eames ? But he 's in Mombasa . Cobol 's ackyard .
COBB: Necessary risk .
ARTHUR: There are plenty of other thieves .
COBB: We do n't just need a thief . We need a forger .
EAMES: You never know .
COBB: Drink ? Eames loses .
EAMES: You 're buying .
COBB: You 're spelling has n't improved .
EAMES: Piss off .
COBB: How 's your handwriting ?
EAMES: Versatile .
COBB: Yeah ?
EAMES: There 's a price on your head from Cobol Engineering . Pretty big one , actually .
COBB: You would n't sell me out . Eames looks at Cobb , offended .
EAMES: ` Course I would .
COBB: Not when you hear what I 'm selling .
EAMES: It 's perfectly possible . Just loody difficult .
COBB: That 's what I keep saying to Arthur .
EAMES: Arthur ? You 're still working with that stick-in-the-mud ?
COBB: He 's a good point man .
EAMES: The best . But he has no imagination . If you 're going to perform inception , you need imagination .
COBB: You 've done it before ?
EAMES: Yeas and no . We tried it . Got the idea in place , but it did n't take .
COBB: You did n't plant it deep enough ?
EAMES: It 's not just about depth . You need the simplest version of the idea- the one that will grow naturally in the subject 's mind . Subtle art .
COBB: That 's why I 'm here .
EAMES: What 's the idea you need to plant ?
COBB: We want the heir to a majo corporation to break up his father 's empire .
EAMES: See , right there you 've got various political motivations , anti- monopolistic sentiment and so forth . But all that stuff 's at the mercy of the subject 's prejudice- you have to go to the basic .
COBB: Which is ?
EAMES: The relationship with the father . Do you have a chemist ?
COBB: Let 's go see him .
EAMES: Once you 've lost your tail . Back by the bar , blue tie . Came in about two minutes after we did .
COBB: Cobol Engineering ?
EAMES: They pretty much own Mombasa . Cobb glances over the balcony .
COBB: Run interference . We 'll meet downstairs in half an hour .
EAMES: Back here ?
COBB: Last place they 'd expect .
EAMES: Freddy ! The Businessman looks up , awkward .
COBB: Yes ?
SECOND BUSINESSMAN: We need to-
SAITO: Care for a lift , Mr. Cobb ?
COBB: What brings you to Mombasa , Mr. Saito ?
SAITO: I have to protect my investment .
EAMES: This is your idea of losing a tail ?
COBB: Different tail .
ARTHUR: He said you 'd be back .
ARIADNE: I tried not to come .
ARTHUR: But there 's nothing else quite like it .
ARIADNE: No paper , no pens nothing etween you and raw , direct creation . Arthur picks up his mechanism .
ARTHUR: Shall we take a look at paradoxical architecture ? Ariadne nods , takes off her coat and we-
ARIADNE: What sort of tricks ?
ARTHUR: In a dream , you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes .
ARTHUR: See
ARIADNE: How big do the levels have to be ?
ARTHUR: Anything from the floor of a uilding , to an entire city . But it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections .
ARIADNE: A maze .
ARTHUR: And the better the maze-
ARIADNE: The longer we have before the projections catch us .
ARTHUR: You wait , they 'll turn ugly . No one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind .
ARIADNE: Cobb ca n't build anymore , can he ?
ARTHUR: I do n't know if he ca n't , but he wo n't . He thinks it 's safer if he does n't know the layouts .
ARIADNE: Why ?
ARTHUR: He wo n't tell me . I think it 's Mal . I think she 's getting stronger .
ARIADNE: His ex-wife ?
ARTHUR: She 's not his ex .
ARIADNE: They 're still together ? Arthur turns to Ariadne . Gentle .
ARTHUR: No . No , she 's dead , Ariadne . What you see in there is just his projection of her .
ARIADNE: What was she like in real life ?
ARTHUR: She was lovely .
SAITO: Robert Fischer , 32 . Heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate . He 's spent his whole life being groomed as successor-breaking up his father 's empire will take a adical shift in his thinking .
COBB: What 's your problem with Fischer ?
SAITO: That 's not your concern .
COBB: This is n't the usual corporate espionage , Mr. Saito . This is inception . The seed of the idea we plant will grow in this man 's mind . It 'll change him . It might even come to define him . Saito looks at Cobb .
SAITO: My sources suggest you might not have always been so cautious .
COBB: Then you need new sources , Mr. Saito . Saito considers Cobb . Shrugs .
SAITO: Fischer Morrow has the regulators in their pockets . We 're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance and we can no longer compete . Soon they 'll control the energy supply of half the world . They 'll be able to lackmail governments , dictate policy . In effect , they become a new superpower . The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind .
EAMES: That 's where we come in . How 's Robert Fischer 's relationship to his father ?
SAITO: Rumor is the relationship is complicated .
COBB: We 'll need more than rumor , Mr. Saito .
EAMES: Can you get me access to him ? Browning . Fischer senior 's right- hand man . Fischer junior 's godfather .
SAITO: It should be possible . If you can get the right references .
EAMES: References are something of a specialty for me , Mr. Saito .
YUSUF: Come , come .
COBB: You 're well informed , Mr. Yusuf .
YUSUF: Yusuf 's Somnacin .
COBB: As good as the real thing ?
YUSUF: Better .
COBB: And to come into the held with us .
YUSUF: I rarely go into the held , Mr. Cobb .
COBB: We need you there to tailo compounds to our particula equirements .
YUSUF: Which are ?
COBB: Great depth .
YUSUF: A dream within a dream ? Two levels ?
COBB: Three .
YUSUF: Not possible . That many dreams within dreams would be too unstable .
COBB: I 've done it before . You just have to add a sedative .
YUSUF: A powerful sedative . How many team members ?
COBB: Five .
SAITO: Six . The only way to know you 've done the job is if I go in with you .
COBB: There 's no room for tourists on these jobs , Mr. Saito .
SAITO: This time , it would seem there is .
YUSUF: Of course . I use it every day .
COBB: For what ?
YUSUF: Perhaps you will not want to see .
EAMES: Eighteen , twenty-all connected , loody hell .
YUSUF: They come every day . To share the dream .
COBB: How long do they dream ?
YUSUF: Three , four hours . Every day .
COBB: How long in dream time ?
YUSUF: With this compound about forty hours . Each and every day . Saito surveys the room , appalled .
SAITO: Why do they do it ?
YUSUF: Tell him , Mr. Cobb .
COBB: After a while It becomes the only way you can dream .
YUSUF: Do you still dream , Mr. Cobb ? Cobb STARES at the sleepers . Uneasy .
EAMES: They come here every day to sleep ?
COBB: Let 's see what you can do .
YUSUF: Sharp , no ? Cobb nods . Gets to his feet , looking around-
SAITO: Everything alright , Mr. Cobb ?
COBB: Everything 's fine .
ARIADNE: You 're back . Cobb looks up with a start . Caught out .
COBB: I just-I need to test some things . I did n't realize anyone was here .
ARIADNE: Just working on my totem .
COBB: Let me see-
ARIADNE: It 's an elegant solution to keeping track of reality . Your invention ?
COBB: No . Mal 's . Cobb pulls out his spinning top . Looks at it .
ARIADNE: Arthur told me she died .
COBB: She did . How are the mazes coming ?
ARIADNE: Good . Each level relates to the part of the subject 's subconscious we 're trying to access . I 'm making the bottom level a hospital , so that Fischer will bring his fathe there-
COBB: Do n't tell me . Remember , you only want the dreamer to know the layout .
ARIADNE: Why 's that so important ?
COBB: In case one of us brings in part of our subconscious . You would n't want any projections knowing the layout .
ARIADNE: In case you bring Mal in . Cobb says nothing .
COBB: No .
ARIADNE: You have to warn them if it 's getting worse-
COBB: I did n't say it 's getting worse . Look , Ariadne , I need them for this job . I need you for this job . Without your help , I 'll never get ack to my children . And that 's all I can care about right now .
ARIADNE: Why ca n't you go home , Cobb ? Cobb looks at her , deciding what to say .
COBB: They think I killed her .
ARIADNE: How did she die ? Cobb thinks .
COBB: Thank you .
ARIADNE: For what ?
COBB: Not asking whether I did .
COBB: An idea Robert Fischer 's conscious mind would never accept . We have to plant it deep in his subconscious .
ARTHUR: How deep ?
COBB: Three levels down .
ARTHUR: A dream within a dream within a dream ? Is that even possible ?
COBB: Yes . It is .
ARTHUR: How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion ?
COBB: That 's what we have to figure out . Robert and his father have a tense elationship . Worse , even , than the gossip columns have suggested
EAMES: Do you play on that ? Suggest eaking up his father 's company as a 'screw you ' to the old man ?
COBB: No . Positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time . We yearn for people to be reconciled , for catharsis . We need positive emotional logic .
EAMES: Try this `` MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
COBB: That might work .
ARTHUR: Might ? We 'll have to do better than that .
EAMES: Thanks for the contribution , Arthur .
ARTHUR: Forgive me for wanting a little specificity , Eames .
COBB: Inception 's not about specificity . When we get inside his head , we 're going to have to work with what we find . Arthur shrugs , frustrated . And we-
EAMES: We could split the idea into emotional triggers , and use one on each level .
COBB: How do you mean ?
EAMES: On the top level , we open up his elationship with his father . Say `` I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY FATHER 'S FOOTSTEPS . '' Next level down we 've accessed his ambition and self-esteem . We feed him `` I
COBB: `` MY FATHER DOES N'T WANT ME TO BE HIM . ''
EAMES: That could do it .
ARTHUR: How do you produce these emotional triggers ?
EAMES: I forge each emotional concept in the style and manner of Pete Browning , a key figure in Fischer 's emotional life . Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view .
ARTHUR: Are those yours ? Eames shakes his head . Cobb turns to Yusuf .
YUSUF: Yup . Sorry .
COBB: Suppress them . We do n't bring ou own projections into the dream-we let Fischer 's subconscious supply the people .
EAMES: Saito , when do I get to see Browning ?
SAITO: You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday . We 've arranged for you to spend several days
BROWNING: I 'm not smelling settlement here-we take them down .
LAWYER: Mr. Browning , Maurice Fischer 's policy is always one of avoiding litigation-
BROWNING: Shall we relay your concerns directly to Maurice ?
FATHER: Robert ! I 've told you to keep out the damn ! -
BROWNING: Must be a cherished memory of his-
FISCHER: I put it by his bed . He has n't even noticed .
BROWNING: Robert , we have to talk about a power of attorney . I know this is hard for you , but it 's important that we start to think about the future-
FISCHER: Not now , Uncle Peter .
EAMES: Now , in the dream , I can impersonate Browning and suggest the concepts to Fischer 's conscious mind Then we take Fischer down anothe level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him .
ARTHUR: So he gives himself the idea .
EAMES: Precisely . That 's the only way to make it stick . It has to seem self-generated .
ARTHUR: Eames , I 'm impressed .
EAMES: Your condescension , as always , is much appreciated , Arthur .
COBB: I thought he had some knee thing ?
EAMES: Nothing they 'd put him under for . Besides , we need a good ten hours .
SAITO: Sydney to Los Angeles . They turn to Saito .
ARTHUR: It 'd have to be a 747 .
COBB: Why ?
ARTHUR: On a 747 the pilots are up above , first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin . We 'd have to buyout the whole cabin , and the first class flight attendant-
SAITO: We bought the airline . Everyone turns to Saito .
COBB: Neater , huh ? Well , now we have ten uninterrupted hours .
ARTHUR: My question is how we go down three layers with enough stability . Three layers down a little turbulence is gon na translate into an earthquake . The dreams are gon na collapse with the slightest disturbance . Yusuf clears his throat .
YUSUF: Sedation . For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming
COBB: Buying us more time in each level .
YUSUF: Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal .
ARIADNE: How much time ?
YUSUF: Three dreams that 's ten hours , times twenty , times twenty , times twenty
EAMES: Math was never my strong suit .
COBB: It 's basically a week one laye down , six months two layers down-
ARIADNE: And ten years in the third level . Who wants to spend ten years in a dream ?
YUSUF: Depends on the dream .
EAMES: It 's not going to take us long to crack Fischer open once we get going . We 'll be out in a couple days , max .
ARTHUR: How do we get out once we 've made the plant ? I hope you 've got something a little more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head like last time .
COBB: A kick .
ARIADNE: What 's a kick ?
EAMES: That , Ariadne , would be a kick .
COBB: That feeling of falling which snaps you awake . We use that to jolt ourselves awake once we 're done .
ARTHUR: But how are we going to feel that through the sedation ?
YUSUF: That 's the clever part . I customize the sedative
ARTHUR: Even that wo n't cut through three layers of deep sleep .
COBB: The trick is to devise a kick fo each level , then synchronize them to get a snap that penetrates all three layers .
ARTHUR: We can use the musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks .
MAL: You remember when you asked me to marry you ?
COBB: Of course
MAL: You said you had a dream
COBB: That we 'd grow old together .
MAL: And we can . You know how to find me you know what you have to do .
COBB: You should n't be in here . Cobb guides her back into the elevator .
ARIADNE: I wanted to know what `` tests '' you need to do on your own every night .
COBB: This is the only way I can still dream .
ARIADNE: Is it so important to dream ? Cobb stares at his family .
COBB: In my dreams we 're still together .
ARIADNE: But these are n't just dreams , are they ? They 're memories . You said never to use memories .
COBB: And I should n't .
ARIADNE: You 're keeping her alive .
COBB: No .
ARIADNE: You ca n't let her go .
COBB: No . These are moments I regret . Moments I turned into dreams so I could change them .
ARIADNE: What 've you got buried down there that you regret ?
COBB: There 's only one thing I need you to understand about me
ARIADNE: This is your house ?
COBB: Mine and Mal 's .
ARIADNE: Where is she ?
COBB: She 'd already died .
THIN MAN: Right now . Or never , Cobb . Cobb nods , turns from the window-
COBB: Then I panic that I 'll always wish I 'd seen them turn , that I ca n't waste this chance
ARIADNE: My name is-
MAL: I know who you are . What are you doing here ?
ARIADNE: I do n't know . Trying to understand .
MAL: How could you understand ? Do you know what it is to be a lover ? To e half of a whole ?
ARIADNE: No . Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne
MAL: I 'll tell you a riddle . You 're waiting for a train . A train that will take you far away . You know where you hope this train will take you , but you do n't know for sure Mal glides around Ariadne , looking her over .
ARIADNE: What is this place ?
COBB: A hotel . We spent our anniversaries in this suite .
ARIADNE: What happened here ?
MAL: you PROMISED ! YOU SAID WE 'D BE
COBB: We can . We will . But I need you to stay here for now-
COBB: I 'll come back . I need you to stay here on your own for now . Just while I do this job . Then we can be together-
MAL: WE 'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED ! -
ARIADNE: You think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in ? You think that 's going to contain her ?
SAITO: Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney .
COBB: When 's the funeral ?
SAITO: Thursday . In Los Angeles .
COBB: Robert 'll accompany the body Tuesday at the outside . We have to move . Cobb gets up . Ariadne comes over to him .
ARIADNE: I 'm coming with you .
COBB: No . I promised Miles .
ARIADNE: The team needs someone in there who understands what you 're struggling with . If you do n't want it to be me then you need to show Arthur what I just saw . Cobb looks at Ariadne . Turns to Saito .
COBB: We need one more seat on the plane .
SAITO: Complete the job en route , I make one phone call from the plane you will have no trouble clearing immigration .
EAMES: Oh , sorry .
COBB: Excuse me ? Fischer looks up .
FISCHER: Yes ?
COBB: I think this is yours
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you gentlemen care for a drink ?
FISCHER: Water .
COBB: Same .
FISCHER: Well , thank you .
COBB: No problem . Look , I could n't help noticing your name . You 're not elated to Maurice Fischer ?
FISCHER: Actually , he was my father .
COBB: I 'm very sorry for your loss . He was an inspiring figure .
ARTHUR: Could n't you have peed before you went under ?
YUSUF: Sorry .
EAMES: Bit too much free champagne before takeoff , Yusuf ?
YUSUF: Ha bloody ha .
COBB: At least we know he 'll be looking for a cab in this .
CABDRIVER: Hey , asshole ! Why do n't you try driving without your thumb up-
COBB: Walk away .
FISCHER: Third and Market . Snappy . Eames JUMPS in from the other side .
EAMES: Sorry , I thought it was free . Maybe we could share .
FISCHER: Maybe not .
EAMES: I 'm afraid-
COBB: Come on ! -
ARIADNE: This was n't in the design-
ARTHUR: Everybody okay ? Saito ?
COBB: Arthur ! Arthur what the-
ARTHUR: I do n't know . What happened back there ? Where were you ?
COBB: We were blocked by a freight train .
ARTHUR: Why would you put a train crossing in a downtown intersection ?
ARIADNE: I did n't .
COBB: Why were we all ambushed , Arthur ? ! Those were n't regular projections- they 'd been trained !
ARIADNE: How could they be trained ?
ARTHUR: Fischer 's had an extractor teach his mind to defend itself . His subconscious is militarized . It should 've shown on the research-
COBB: So why the hell did n't it ? !
ARTHUR: Calm down .
COBB: Do n't tell me to calm down-you were meant to check Fischer 's background thoroughly . You ca n't make this kind of mistake-we 're not prepared for this kind of violence-
ARTHUR: Cobb , we 've dealt with sub-security efore . We just have to be more-
COBB: This was n't part of the plan , Arthur ! He 's dying !
EAMES: So we put him out of his misery .
COBB: No .
EAMES: He 's in agony . Let 's wake him up- Cobb GRABS Eames 's arm .
COBB: No ! It wo n't wake him up .
EAMES: What do you mean , it wo n't wake him ? When you die in a dream you wake up .
YUSUF: Not from this . We 're too heavily sedated to wake up that way . Eames looks at Yusuf , then to Cobb .
EAMES: So what happens if one of us dies ?
COBB: That person does n't wake up . Thei mind drops into Limbo .
ARIADNE: Limbo ?
ARTHUR: Unconstructed dream space .
ARIADNE: What 's down there ?
ARTHUR: Raw , infinite subconscious . Nothing there but what was left behind by anyone on the team who 's been trapped there before . On this team just Cobb .
ARIADNE: How long would we be stuck there ?
YUSUF: You could n't even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases-
EAMES: How long ?
YUSUF: Decades-it could be infinite-I do n't know ! Ask him-he 's the one who 's been there before ! Eames moves to Cobb . Looks him in the eye .
EAMES: Great . So now we 're stuck in Fischer 's mind battling it out with his private army , and if we get hit we 're stuck in Limbo 'til ou ains dissolve into scrambled egg ? Cobb says nothing . Saito groans more loudly .
ARTHUR: Let 's just get him upstairs .
COBB: There was n't meant to be any risk . We were n't supposed to be dealing with a load of gunnre .
ARTHUR: You had no right .
COBB: It 's the only way you can go three layers deep , Arthur . Arthur turns to Yusuf , hostile .
ARTHUR: And you . You went along with this ?
YUSUF: I trusted him .
ARTHUR: You trusted him ? When ? When he promised you half his share ?
YUSUF: No ! His whole share . Plus , he told me he 'd done it before . Arthur turns to Cobb .
ARTHUR: Oh , yeah ? With Mal ? That worked out great , did n't it , Cobb ? Cobb grabs Arthur .
COBB: You do n't know anything about that . This was the only way to do this job , Arthur . I did what I had to do to get back to my children .
EAMES: So you led us into a war zone with no way out .
COBB: We have a way out . The kick . We just have to push on , do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick .
EAMES: Forget it . We go any deeper , we just raise the stakes . I 'm sitting it out on this level .
COBB: You 'll never make it , Eames . Fischer 's security is surrounding this place as we speak . The ten hours of the flight is a week at this level-you 'll never make it without getting killed . Downwards is the only way forwards . We have to carry on . Saito groans . Cobb looks at him-
FISCHER: I 'm insured against kidnapping up to ten million-this 'll be simple-
COBB: No , it wo n't . Fischer looks at Cobb , unnerved .
ARTHUR: In . your lather 's office , below the ookshelves , is his personal safe . We need the combination .
FISCHER: I never noticed a safe-
COBB: Does n't mean you do n't know the combination .
FISCHER: Well , I do n't .
ARTHUR: We have it on good authority that you do .
FISCHER: Whose ?
YUSUF: Five hundred dollars , this cost ?
EAMES: What 's inside ?
YUSUF: Cash , cards , ID and this-
EAMES: Useful ?
COBB: You 're on . You 've got an hour .
EAMES: An hour ? I was supposed to have all night to crack him .
COBB: And Saito was supposed to keep his guts on the inside . You 've got an hour-get something we can use .
FISCHER: What 's that ?
ARTHUR: Good authority .
FISCHER: Uncle Peter ? ! Make them stop-
ARTHUR: The combination .
FISCHER: I do n't know it !
ARTHUR: Why would Browning tell us you did ?
FISCHER: Let me talk to him-I 'll find out .
COBB: You 've got an hour . Get talking . Cobb leaves .
FISCHER: Neither do I , Uncle Peter .
BROWNING: Maurice told me that after he passed only you would be able to open it .
FISCHER: He never gave me the combination .
BROWNING: He did , he just did n't tell you that it was a combination .
FISCHER: What , then ?
BROWNING: Something only you would know . Some meaningful combination of numbers from your experiences with Maurice-
FISCHER: We did n't have a lot of meaningful experiences together .
BROWNING: Perhaps after your mother died
FISCHER: After my mother died , I went to him in my grief .
BROWNING: He always had a hard time with emotional-
FISCHER: I was eleven , Uncle Peter . Browning takes this in .
BROWNING: He loved you , Robert . In his way .
FISCHER: `` In his way ? '' At the end he called me to his deathbed . He could barely speak , but he took the trouble to say one last thing to me . He pulled me close I could make out only one word . `` Disappointed . '' Browning can say nothing .
COBB: How 's he doing ?
ARIADNE: He 's in a lot of pain .
COBB: When we get you down to the next level , the pain will be less intense . Saito nods , breathing hard .
ARIADNE: And if he dies ?
COBB: His conscious mind will drop out of the dream . He 'll be trapped in Limbo for a lifetime
ARIADNE: What will that do to him ?
COBB: When he wakes his mind could be completely gone .
SAITO: When when we wake I will still honor our arrangement Cobb looks down at Saito sadly .
COBB: Saito-san , when you wake you might not even remember that we had an arrangement . You 'll have forgotten this world . Limbo will be you eality . Lost there so long , you 'll have become an old man
SAITO: Filled with regret ?
COBB: Waiting to die alone . Yes .
SAITO: Then I 'll take the chance and come ack . And we 'll be young men together again .
ARIADNE: When were you trapped in Limbo ?
COBB: What truth ?
ARIADNE: The truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wall . The truth that Mal is ursting up through you subconscious .
ARIADNE: This is not just about Fischer , it 's about you . Tell me what happened to you and Mal . Trapped in Limbo . Cobb looks at her . Thinking it through .
COBB: We were on a job . Exploring dreams within dreams . But we did n't understand how your mind can turn hours into years . How you can get trapped . Trapped so deep that when you wash up on the shore of you subconscious
ARIADNE: How long were you stuck ?
COBB: Fifty years . Ariadne stares at him , incredulous .
ARIADNE: How did you stand it ?
COBB: We built . We created a whole world for ourselves
ARIADNE: But not for her ?
COBB: She accepted it . At some point
ARIADNE: And when you finally woke up ?
COBB: To wake from that . From decades lived . To be old souls thrown back into youth . It was hard . At first Mal seemed okay . But I started to ealize something was wrong . Finally she admitted it . This idea she was possessed by . This simple little idea that changed everything
ARIADNE: What was it ?
COBB: That our world was not real . No matter what I did , no matter what I said , she was convinced that we were still in a dream . That we needed to wake up again
ARIADNE: What about your children ? Cobb has to look away .
COBB: She she believed they were n't eal . That our real children were waiting . Somewhere above
MAL: They 're projections , Dom . You dreams . I 'm their mother-do n't you think I can tell the difference ?
COBB: If it 's my dream then why ca n't I control it ? Why ca n't I stop this ?
MAL: You do n't know you 're dreaming .
COBB: You keep telling me I am-
MAL: And you do n't believe me !
COBB: Mal , come back inside .
MAL: No . I 'm going to jump . And you 're coming with me .
COBB: No , I 'm not . This is real-if you jump , you 're not going to wake up , you 're going to die . Let 's go back inside and talk about this , please .
MAL: We 've talked enough . She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP .
COBB: I ca n't do that , Mal . I ca n't leave our children .
MAL: If I go without you , they 'll take them away , anyway .
COBB: What do you mean ?
MAL: I filed a letter with our attorney . Explaining how I 'm fearful for my safety , how you 've threatened to kill me
COBB: Out children are here , Mal .
MAL: You 're waiting for a train
COBB: NO ! MAL , NO , I CA N'T !
MAL: A train that will take you fa away
COBB: DO N'T DO THIS !
MAL: You know where you hope this train will take you , you ca n't know fo sure
COBB: DO N'T !
MAL: But it does n't matter
COBB: NO !
MAL: Because you 'll be together
COBB: He letter to the authorities efuted all the claims about he sanity that she knew I 'd make
THIN MAN: Right now . Or never , Cobb .
ARIADNE: Psychiatrists judged her sane ?
COBB: She was sane . She was just lost in the labyrinth .
ARIADNE: Then why should you blame yourself ?
COBB: Because we were a family . And we had a life I would do anything to get back to now . But that reality was n't enough for me then .
ARIADNE: It might have been your idea to push the limits , Cobb . But you 're not responsible for the idea that destroyed her . The idea that he world was n't real that was he own idea from her own mind . Cobb says nothing .
COBB: You do n't have to do this for me-
ARIADNE: I 'm doing it for the others . They do n't know the risk they 've taken coming in here with you .
COBB: We ca n't stay here . Arthur ? !
BROWNING: These people are going to kill us if we do n't give them the combination .
FISCHER: They wo n't , they 'll try to ransom us-
BROWNING: I heard them-they 're going to lock us in and run the can into the iver .
FISCHER: What is in the safe ?
BROWNING: Something for you . Maurice always said it was his most previous gift a will .
FISCHER: Maurice 's will is with Port and Dunn .
BROWNING: It 's an alternate . It supersedes the other only if you want it to .
FISCHER: What does it say ?
BROWNING: It splits all the component usinesses of Fischer Morrow into individual companies , transferring ownership to the boards of those companies
FISCHER: Leaving me nothing ?
BROWNING: A basic living . Nothing more . The entire empire would cease to exist .
FISCHER: Destroy my own inheritance ? Why would he suggest such a thing ?
BROWNING: I do n't know , Robert . Cobb OPENS the door . Arthur is behind him .
COBB: Come to your senses ?
FISCHER: Let us go . I do n't know the combination . Not consciously .
COBB: Let 's try instinctively . I have someone standing in your father 's office ready to tap in a combination . He holds the phone to Fischer 's mouth .
FISCHER: I have no idea- Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browning-
COBB: RIGHT NOW !
FISCHER: Five , two , eight four , nine , one .
COBB: You 'll have to do better . Bag ` em . Arthur puts SACKS over their heads .
FISCHER: We 're worth much more to you alive
EAMES: His relationship with his father 's much worse that we thought .
ARTHUR: That helps us ?
COBB: The stronger the issues , the more powerful the catharsis .
ARTHUR: But how do you reconcile them if they 're that estranged ?
EAMES: I 'm working on that . Arthur lines up a shot through the window-
ARTHUR: Well , work fast-Fischer 's projections are closing in quick , we need to break out of here before we 're totally boxed in
EAMES: Should n't be afraid to dream a little bigger , Arthur-
COBB: Shifting Fischer 's antipathy from his father onto Browning should work .
EAMES: We need the imagery , the words
ARIADNE: So you destroy his one positive elationship ?
COBB: No . We repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfather 's true nature .
EAMES: Hell , we should be charging Fische as much as Saito .
ARTHUR: What about his security ? It 's going to get worse as we go deeper .
COBB: We bring in Mr. Charles .
ARTHUR: No .
EAMES: Who 's Mr. Charles ?
ARTHUR: A bad idea .
COBB: Arthur , the second we approach Fischer in that hotel , they 're gon na mow us down-we run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job .
EAMES: So you 've done it before ?
ARTHUR: Sure . But it did n't work . The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces . Eames takes this in .
EAMES: You learned a lot , though . Right ?
COBB: I 'll need a decoy .
EAMES: No problem . How about a pretty young lady I 've used before ?
COBB: Fine-
ARTHUR: And do n't make the jump too soon- that kick is our only way back , we have to be ready to catch it-
YUSUF: I 'll use the music to let you know when it 's coming , but the rest is up to you .
FISCHER: I have a lot on my mind .
ARTHUR: And there goes Mr. Charles .
ARIADNE: Who or what , exactly , is Mr. Charles ?
ARTHUR: It 's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious .
COBB: Mr. Fishcer ! Good to see you again . Rod Green , Marketing . And you must be
BLONDE: Leaving .
COBB: I think you just got blown off unless her phone number really does have only six digits . Fischer glances at the napkin `` 528-491 . ''
ARIADNE: And why do n't you approve ?
ARTHUR: Because it involves telling the mark that he 's dreaming . Which involves attracting a lot of attention to us .
ARIADNE: Did n't Cobb say never to do that ?
ARTHUR: You must 've noticed by now how much time Cobb spends doing things he says never to do .
COBB: Strange way to make friends . Lifting your wallet , I mean .
FISCHER: Goddamn it . The wallet alone 's worth-
COBB: Five hundred bucks . I know . Do n't worry , my guys are on it .
FISCHER: Who did you say you were ?
COBB: I said I was Rod Green from Marketing-but I 'm not . My name is Mr. Charles . I might seem familia to you . I 'm in charge of you security here .
BLONDE: Mr. Saito , can I have a minute ?
SAITO: I 'm sorry , but
EAMES: You look a bit perkier . A SHUDDER ripples through the elevator .
SAITO: Turbulence on the plane .
EAMES: Feels closer . That 's Yusuf 's driving . And we-
FISCHER: Security ? You work for the hotel ?
COBB: No . My specialty is subconscious security .
FISCHER: You 're talking about dreams . You 're talking about extraction .
COBB: Exactly . My job is to protect you
EAMES: Get off at a different floor and keep moving . Dump the wallet , then meet me in the lobby . The security will try to track it down . We need to buy Cobb a little more time .
COBB: You 're not safe here .
ARIADNE: What 's happening ?
ARTHUR: Cobb 's drawing Fischer 's attention to the strangeness of the dream . That 's making his subconscious look for the dreamer . For me . And we-
COBB: Very odd-the weather , the gravity
FISCHER: So you you 're not real ? The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again .
COBB: No . I 'm a projection of you subconscious . I was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream . I believe that 's what has happened .
FISCHER: Hey-
COBB: Look at the gun in his hand .
FISCHER: If this is a dream , I have to kill myself and wake up- Fischer raises the gun towards his head-
COBB: I would n't do that-they 've probably got you sedated . If you pull that trigger , you might not wake up , you might drop into a lower dream state .
ARTHUR: So , if everything 's correct , this oom should be directly below 528 .
COBB: What do you remember from before this dream ?
FISCHER: Rain gunfire Uncle Peter . Christ-we 've been kidnapped .
COBB: Where were they holding you ?
FISCHER: They had us in the back of a van
COBB: Your body 's bouncing around in the ack of a van right now-that explains the gravity shifts .
FISCHER: It was to do with a safe Christ , why 's it so hard to emember ?
COBB: It 's like trying to remember a dream after you 've woken up . It takes years of practice to do it easily . So , you and Browning have een pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind . What ?
FISCHER: They wanted a combination to a safe they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head .
COBB: That 's them extracting a locator .
FISCHER: A locator ?
COBB: A number from your own subconscious . It can be used any number of ways This is a hotel . Room numbers . What was the number you gave them ?
FISCHER: 5 , 2 something it was a long number . 528 528 , 4 something .
COBB: Well , we know where to start . Fifth floor .
ARIADNE: Do you use a timer ?
ARTHUR: No , I have to judge it myself . Once you 're all asleep up in room 528 , I wait ` til Yusuf starts his kick
ARIADNE: How will you know ?
ARTHUR: His music warns me it 's coming , then the van hitting the barrier of the bridge should be unmistakable- that 's when I blow the floor out from underneath us and we get a nice synchronized kick . Too soon , and we wo n't get pulled out ; too late and I wo n't be able to drop us .
ARIADNE: Why not ?
ARTHUR: The van will be in free fall . I ca n't drop us with no gravity . Arthur finishes setting the charges .
SAITO: I see you 've changed .
BROWNING: I 'm sorry ?
SAITO: I 'm I mistook you for a friend .
BROWNING: Good-looking fellow , I 'm sure . Browning moves off . Saito approaches Eames .
EAMES: That 's Fischer 's projection of Browning . We 'll keep an eye on how he behaves-
SAITO: Why ?
EAMES: How he acts will tell us if Fischer 's starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to .
COBB: They work for me .
ARTHUR: Mr. Charles !
COBB: You know what this is ?
FISCHER: I think so . But I do n't understand .
COBB: They were going to put you under .
FISCHER: I 'm already under .
COBB: Under again .
FISCHER: A dream within a dream ?
ARTHUR: Shhhh !
FISCHER: Uncle Peter . What 's going on ?
COBB: You said you were kidnapped together ?
FISCHER: Not exactly , they already had him . They 'd been torturing him
COBB: You saw them torture him ?
FISCHER: The kidnappers are working for you .
BROWNING: No , Robert-
FISCHER: You 're trying to get that safe open . To get the alternate will . Browning looks up at Fischer .
BROWNING: Fischer Morrow 's been my entire life . I ca n't let you destroy it .
FISCHER: I 'm not going to throw away my inheritance . Why would I ?
BROWNING: I could n't take the chance of you ising to your father 's final taunt .
FISCHER: What taunt ?
BROWNING: That will . I 'm sorry , Robert , but it 's his final insult . A challenge to build something for yourself . He 's telling you that you are n't worthy of his achievements . Fischer takes this in . Devastated .
FISCHER: That he was `` disappointed ? ''
BROWNING: I 'm so sorry . But he was wrong . You 'll make his company even greater than he ever could .
COBB: Your godfather 's lying , Robert . Fischer turns to Cobb .
FISCHER: How do you know ?
COBB: It 's what I do . He 's hiding something . Cobb looks at Browning .
ARTHUR: He 's out .
ARIADNE: Wait , Cobb-I 'm lost . Whose subconscious are we going into ?
COBB: Fischer 's . I told him it was Browning 's so he 'd come with us as part of our team .
ARTHUR: He 's going to help us break into his own subconscious .
COBB: That 's the idea . He 'll think that his security is Browning 's and fight them to learn the truth about his father .
ARTHUR: I 'll lead them on a merry chase .
COBB: Be back in time for the kick .
ARTHUR: I 'm on it .
ARIADNE: What 's down there ?
COBB: Hopefully , the truth we want Fischer to learn .
ARIADNE: I meant what 's down there for you ?
COBB: You 're the dreamer . I need you to draw the security away from the complex .
EAMES: Then who guides Fischer in ? You ?
COBB: If I know the route we could be compromised .
ARIADNE: I designed the place .
COBB: No . You 're with me .
FISCHER: You 're not coming in ?
COBB: You have to do this on your own . You have to get in there , break into your godfather 's mind and find out the truth about your father . Cobb taps Fischer 's radio mike .
YUSUF: Bugger .
ARTHUR: Hey !
YUSUF: Sod it . I hope your ready .
ARTHUR: No , Yusuf . Too soon ! SHOTS slam into the stairs around him and we-
EAMES: I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at first I thought it was just wind
COBB: No , it 's music . Dammit .
SAITO: We 're going as fast as we can .
ARIADNE: How long do we have ?
COBB: Yusuf 's about ten seconds from the jump , which gives Arthur about three minutes , which gives us about-
ARIADNE: Sixty minutes .
COBB: The route you gave them , can they do it in under an hour ?
ARIADNE: I do n't think so . They 've still got to climb down to the middle terrace .
COBB: They need a new route-a direct oute .
ARIADNE: The building 's designed as a labyrinth .
COBB: There must be access routes that cut through the maze . Eames ?
ARIADNE: Yes .
COBB: What did he add ? Ariadne looks at Cobb .
ARIADNE: I should n't tell you . If Mal-
COBB: There 's no time-what did he add ?
ARIADNE: Utility closets , trap doors
COBB: What about service features ? Did he add any large pipes or-
ARIADNE: Ducts . He added an air duct system- it does n't follow the maze . They can use it to go straight from the outer walls to the upper tower .
COBB: Explain it to them .
ARIADNE: Saito ?
SAITO: Go ahead . And we-
ARTHUR: Paradox .
SAITO: Look out !
ARIADNE: What was that ?
COBB: The kick .
EAMES: What the hell do we do now ?
COBB: When the van hits the water . I figure Arthur 's got a couple minutes and we 've got about twenty .
ARTHUR: How the hell do I drop you ?
ARIADNE: That 's the antechamber outside the strongroom .
COBB: What about the strongroom ? Does n't it have any windows ?
ARIADNE: Would n't be very strong if it did . Look , if you wanted to design it yourself-
COBB: It 's fine . Better hope that we like what Fischer finds in there .
ARIADNE: These projections , they 're part of his subconscious ?
COBB: Yeah .
ARIADNE: Are you destroying those parts of his mind ?
COBB: No , of course not . They 're just projections .
EAMES: They 're heading your way . Like they know something .
COBB: Buy us some time .
FISCHER: We 're here . Are we clear to proceed ?
COBB: You 're clear , but hurry-there 's an army headed your way
ARIADNE: Fischer , stop ! It 's a trap ! -
COBB: Come on a little lower a little-
ARIADNE: Cobb , that 's not really her- Cobb turns to her-
COBB: How can you know that ?
FISCHER: I 'm in . Fischer turns up the volume-
MAL: Hello .
ARIADNE: Cobb , she 's just a projection . Fischer he 's real .
EAMES: What happened ?
ARIADNE: Mal killed Fischer-
COBB: I would n't shoot her .
EAMES: So that it , then ? We failed .
COBB: I 'm sorry .
EAMES: It 's you who does n't get back to your family .
ARIADNE: There 's still a way We follow Fischer down- They look at her .
EAMES: We 're almost out of time-
ARIADNE: Down there they 'll be enough time . We 'll find him-soon as you hea Arthur 's music start , you use the defibrillator to revive him-we give him his own early kick from below .
EAMES: Okay , Saito can hold them off while I plant the rest of the charges .
COBB: Saito 's not going to last , Eames .
ARIADNE: We have to try !
EAMES: Go for it , but I 'm taking the kick whether you 're back or not
ARIADNE: Can I trust you to do what 's needed ? Mal 's down there-
COBB: And I can find her . She 'll have Fischer .
ARIADNE: How do you know ?
COBB: She wants me to come after him . She wants me back down there with her .
ARIADNE: This is your world ?
COBB: It was . And this is where she 'll e. And we-
EAMES: Come on , Saito . I need you to cove Fischer while I plant the charges .
ARIADNE: You built all this ?
COBB: We both did .
ARIADNE: It 's incredible .
COBB: We built for years . Then , when that got stale , we started in on the memories .
ARIADNE: From what city ?
COBB: No . Our neighborhood . That was our first apartment then we moved to that building we got that small house when Mal ecame pregnant .
ARIADNE: You reconstructed them all from memory ?
COBB: We had time .
ARIADNE: What 's that ?
COBB: The house Mal grew up in .
ARIADNE: Will she be in there ?
COBB: No . Come on-
ARIADNE: How do we send Fischer back ?
COBB: We need some kind of kick .
ARIADNE: What ?
COBB: I 'll improvise .
MAL: The smallest idea , such as `` You world is not real . ''
COBB: I know what 's real .
MAL: What are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream ? Mutable laws of physics ? Tell that to the quantum physicists . Reappearance of the dead ? What about heaven and hell ? Persecution of the dreamer , the creator , the messiah ? They crucified Christ , did n't they ?
COBB: I know what 's real .
MAL: No creeping doubts ? Not feeling persecuted , Dom ? Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces ? The way the projections persecute the dreamer ?
COBB: I have chosen , Mal . Our children . I have to get back to them . Because you left them . You left us .
MAL: You 're wrong , Dom . You 're confused our children are here-
COBB: Our real children are waiting fo me up above . And we-
MAL: Up above ? Listen to yourself . You judged me for believing the very same thing . Mal points at the children-
COBB: They 're not real , Mal . Our real children are waiting for us- The children run off . Cobb opens his eyes .
MAL: You keep telling yourself that but you do n't believe it-
COBB: I know it-
MAL: And what if you 're wrong ? What if I 'm what 's real ? Cobb is silent .
COBB: Guilt . I feel guilt . And howeve confused I might get .
MAL: What truth ?
COBB: That you were wrong to doubt ou world . That the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie
MAL: How could you know it was a lie ?
COBB: Because it was my lie .
MAL: Because you planted the idea in my mind .
COBB: Because I performed inception on my own wife , then reaped the bitte ewards
ARIADNE: Why ?
COBB: We 'd become lost in here . Living in a world of infinite possibilities . A world where we were gods . I ealized we needed to escape , but she 'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world
MAL: Because you 'll be together . The train comes , OBLITERATING the lovers .
COBB: I never thought that the idea I 'd planted would grow in her mind like a cancer . That even after we woke
MAL: That death was the only escape ? INSERT CUT Mal PLUNGES to her death .
COBB: I was trying to save you-I 'm sorry . Mal comes in close to Cobb . Looks him over .
MAL: You infected my mind . You betrayed me . But you can make amends . You can still keep your promise . We can still be together right here . In our world . The world we built together .
ARIADNE: We need Fischer .
MAL: You ca n't have him . Cobb stares at Mal . Mesmerized .
COBB: If I stay , can she take him back ?
ARIADNE: Cobb , what are you saying ?
MAL: Fischer 's on the porch .
ARIADNE: Cobb , you ca n't do this .
COBB: Go check he 's alive , Ariadne .
ARIADNE: He 's here . And it 's time . But you have to come with us .
COBB: Send Fischer , I have to stay-
ARIADNE: You ca n't stay here to be with her- Cobb turns from Mal . Looks at Ariadne .
COBB: I 'm not . Saito is dead by now . That means he 's here . I have to stay here and find him .
MAL: Not real ? I 'm the only thing you do elieve in anymore . Here-does n't this feel real , Dom ?
COBB: I wish you were . But I could n't make you real . I 'm not capable of imagining you in all you complexity and perfection . As you really were . You 're the best I can do . And you 're not real .
ARIADNE: No !
COBB: What 're you doing ?
ARIADNE: Improvising .
EAMES: Get in there-quick !
COBB: No !
FATHER: I was dis dis
FISCHER: I know , Dad . You were disappointed that I could n't be you .
FATHER: I was disappointed that you tried . Fischer hears this . And we-
EAMES: ) Come on , come on
COBB: That 's the kick-you have to go !
ARIADNE: You 're coming !
COBB: No , I 'm not . I 'm staying here to find Saito . And to say goodbye . Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing
ARIADNE: Do n't lose yourself . Find Saito . And bring him back .
COBB: I will .
MAL: We 'd be together forever . You promised me .
COBB: I know . But we ca n't . And I 'm sorry .
MAL: You remember when you asked me to marry you ? You said you dreamt that we 'd grow old together .
COBB: And we did Mal looks at Cobb thinking . Remembering .
BROWNING: I 'm sorry , Robert . Fischer stares at the rain on the water .
FISCHER: The will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man , not live for him . ) And I 'm going to , Uncle Peter .
ARTHUR: What happened ?
ARIADNE: Cobb stayed .
ARTHUR: With Mal ?
ARIADNE: No . To find Saito .
ARTHUR: He 'll be lost
ARIADNE: No . He 'll be alright .
SAITO: So have you come to kill me ? Cobb does not look up .
COBB: Someone from your half-remembered dream ? Saito peers at Cobb .
SAITO: Cobb ? Not possible-he and I were young men together . And I am an old man
COBB: Filled with regret ? Saito REMEMBERS , nods
SAITO: Waiting to die alone , yes . Cobb is STARING at something on the table .
COBB: I came back for you I came to emind you of what you once knew
SAITO: You came to convince me to hono our arrangement ?
COBB: Yes . And to take a leap of faith .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: We 'll be landing in Los Angeles in about twenty minutes . Do you need immigration forms ?

SUPERVISOR: If this is n't an insanely eautiful woman , I 'm hanging up .
TECH ONE: Shut up and listen .
SUPERVISOR: God , I hope it 's not just anothe damned Russian spy job .
TECH THREE: Negative . Computer affirms the signal is unidentified .
TECH TWO: The boy from Air Res Traffic say the skies are clear . No terrestrial launches .
TECH ONE: It 's the real thing . A radio signal from another world .
SUPERVISOR: Let 's not jump the gun . Run a trajectory source computation . Tech Three slides over to another computer . SUPERVISOR I want to know exactly where it 's coming from .
TECH THREE: This ca n't be right .
SUPERVISOR: What 's wrong ?
TECH THREE: Calculated distance from source is at three hundred and eight five thousand kilometers . It 's coming from the moon .
GENERAL GREY: Who else knows about this ?
COMMANDING OFFICER: S.E.T.I . in New Mexico identified a signal but they 're even more confused than we are . The General shoots him a disapproving glance .
GENERAL GREY: Looks like a big turd . The two Officers exchange a glance .
COMMANDING OFFICER: We estimate it has a diameter of over five hundred and fifty kilometers and a mass roughly one fourth the size of our moon .
GENERAL GREY: A meteor ?
SECOND OFFICER: No Sir . Definitely not .
GENERAL GREY: How do you know ?
SECOND OFFICER: Well , er it 's slowing down .
GENERAL GREY: It 's doing what ?
SECOND OFFICER: It 's slowing down , Sir .
GENERAL GREY: Get me the Secretary of Defense . Then wake him up .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Hi . It 's me .
WHITMORE: Hi honey . What time is it there ?
MARGARET: Two in the morning . I know I did n't wake you ?
WHITMORE: As a matter of fact you did .
MARGARET: Liar .
WHITMORE: I have a confession to make . There 's a beautiful young blonde sleeping next to me .
MARGARET: You did n't let her stay up watching T.V . all night ?
WHITMORE: Of course not . The little girl stirs awake , looks up .
PATRICIA: Mommy ?
WHITMORE: You 're flying back right after the luncheon ? Okay , here she is .
PUNDIT #1: the inexperience in public office was inevitably going to catch up with him . He 's scarified his ideals fo & quot ; politics as usual. & quot ;
PUNDIT #2: I said this during the campaign . Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War has no elationship to political leadership . It 's a different animal
PATRICIA: Daddy let me watch Letterman .
WHITMORE: Traitor . Whitmore exits the room .
SECURITY GUARD: Good morning , Mr. President .
WHITMORE: Good morning , George .
CONSTANCE: They 're not attacking you policies , they 're attacking you age . & quot ; addressing Congress , Whitmore seems less like the President and more like the orphan child Olive asking , 'please sir , I 'd like some more . ' & quot ;
WHITMORE: Clever .
CONSTANCE: Age was never an issue when you stuck to your gun . You were thought of as young and idealistic . But the message has gotten lost . There 's too much compromise , too much politics .
WHITMORE: Is n't it amazing how fast everyone can turn against you .
CONSTANCE: Well , the Orange County Registe has named you one of the ten sexiest men of the year .
WHITMORE: You see , substance at last . An AIDE appears at the doorway .
CONSTANCE: Excuse me , Mr. President . It 's the Secretary of Defense . Whitmore goes to the phone , picks it up .
WHITMORE: Yes ? Say that again ?
MOISHE: What are you waiting ? My social security will expire , you 'll still e sitting there .
DAVID: I 'm thinking .
MOISHE: So think already .
DAVID: You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose ?
MOISHE: You do n't move soon . I 'll begin to decompose .
DAVID: Dad , do n't start .
MOISHE: I 'm only saying , it 's been what ? Four years , you still have n't signed your divorce papers .
DAVID: Three years .
MOISHE: Three , four . Move on . It 's not healthy .
DAVID: Look who 's talking healthy . Suddenly David 's beeper goes off .
MOISHE: How many times is that now ? You u > trying to get fired ? David moves his queen .
DAVID: Checkmate . See you tomorrow , Dad .
MOISHE: That 's not checkmate I can still Oh . You could let an old man win once in a while , it would n't kill you .
MARTY: What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you do n't turn it on ?
DAVID: It was turned on . I was ignoring you . What 's the big emergency ?
MARTY: Started this morning . Every channel is making like it 's nineteen fifty . Snow , static , all kinds of distortions . No one knows what the hell is going on .
DAVID: Damn it , Marty . There 's a reason we have bins labeled & quot ; recycle. & quot ;
MARTY: So sue me .
DAVID: Did you try to switch to transponder channels ?
MARTY: Please , would I be this panicked if it was that simple ? David examines the readouts , puzzled .
DAVID: Let 's retrofit the dish to anothe satellite .
MARTY: We 've tried . It 's not working . It 's almost as though they were n't even there . David looks up , puzzled .
DAVID: That 's impossible .
MIGUEL: Stop it .

MIGUEL: He had to re-fuel . There musta een a problem .
LUCAS: We both know what the problem is . He 's a damned nut case , is what he is . I musta been out of my mind . Troy SMACKS the television again .
MIGUEL: Troy , stop it ! I swear to God !
LUCAS: Miguel , if he 's not in the air in twenty minutes , that 's it . I 'm getting someone else .
MIGUEL: Stop it , Troy ! I swear to God !
AIDE #1: CNN is running a story that we 're covering up some kind of nuclea testing experiments

AIDE #2: NASA has been up my butt all morning . They want to know ou position .
CONSTANCE: Our official position is we do n't have an official position .

AIDE #2: Absolutely .
NIMZIKI: What if it does n't & quot ; pass us by ? & quot ; Let 's retarget some ICBMs to blow it out of the sky
GENERAL GREY: Forgive me , but with the little information we do have , the only thing that would accomplish is turn one dangerous falling object into many .
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: What 's the damage ?
CONSTANCE: The press is making up their own stories at this point .
NIMZIKI: Get on the horn with Atlantic Command . Let 's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3 .
GENERAL GREY: That 's not your call to make , Mr. Nimziki .
CONSTANCE: Is n't that a little premature ?
NIMZIKI: I do n't think so .
COMMANDING OFFICER: Our intelligence tells us the object has settled into a stationary orbit .
NIMZIKI: Well that 's good news .
COMMANDING OFFICER: Not really .
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: Pieces ?
COMMANDING OFFICER: Smaller than the whole , yet ove fifteen miles in width themselves .
NIMZIKI: Where are they heading ?
COMMANDING OFFICER: They should be entering ou atmosphere within the next twenty- five minutes .
NIMZIKI: Like it or not , we 're at DEFCON 3 . Recall the troops and put them on yellow alert .
MARTY: Please , tell me you 're getting something .
DAVID: There 's good news and bad news .
MARTY: What 's the bad news ?
DAVID: You 're in meal penalty fo disturbing my lunch .
MARTY: And the good news is you wo n't charge me .
DAVID: No . The good news is I found the problem and it 's not ou equipment . There 's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed .
MARTY: That 's the good news ?
DAVID: Yes , because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it . When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas , we should be able to lock out the overlay completely
MARTY: and we 'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture ? That 's my man .
MIGUEL: Russell ! God damn it , Russell !
RUSSELL: I 'm bringing home the bacon . Earning my keep . And doing a fine job if I do say so myself .
MIGUEL: It 's the wrong field , you idiot ! Lucas ' farm is on the other side of town .
RUSSELL: You sure ?
MIGUEL: Damn it , he was doing you a favor . You know how hard it is to find someone who does n't think you 're completely crazy ?
MORE: What are we supposed to do now ? Huh ? Where are we supposed to go now ?
LIEUTENANT: Ensign , status ?
SAILOR #1: We have a total radar black out over a thirteen kilometer area .
LIEUTENANT: Have a complete diagnostic run
SAILOR #1: Excuse me sir , radar may be malfunctioning but infrared is off the map !
LIEUTENANT: Get the CINC Atlantic Command on the line .
OFFICER: Sir , we now have visual range with incoming over Iraqi airspace .
COMMANDING OFFICER: A second sighting ?
OFFICER: Yes Sir , this just came in from the Eisenhower .
COMMANDING OFFICER: Correction , we have two confirmed visual contacts . One over Iraq , one over the Pacific .
GENERAL GREY: Where in the Pacific ? They 've spotted one off the California coast line .
PRESIDENT: Put it on .
NEWSCASTER: sightings of this atmospheric phenomenon have been reported here in Novosibirsk , Russia and othe parts of Siberia . Moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor , astronomers are baffled as to its origin
GENERAL GREY: Mr. President , we have an AWAC on the west coast . E.T.A . with contact point , three minutes .
PILOT: Negative . We still have zero < /u visibility .
GENERAL GREY: Get them back on line .
AIDE #1: Line 's gone , sir .
AAC CINC: Two more have been spotted ove the Atlantic . One is moving toward New York , the other is headed this direction .
NIMZIKI: Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain .
GENERAL GREY: Sir , I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately .
PRESIDENT: Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia ?
CONSTANCE: More than likely .
NIMZIKI: Mr. President , you can discuss this on the way .
PRESIDENT: I 'm not leaving .
NIMZIKI: We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis
PRESIDENT: I want the Vice President , Secretary of Defense , the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location . I 'm staying here . I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives .
NIMZIKI: But , Mr. President
PRESIDENT: So far these things have not ecome hostile . For the moment let 's assume they wo n't . Connie , let 's issue statements advising people not to panic , to stay home and take cover .
GENERAL GREY: With your permission , Mr. President , I 'd like to remain my your side .
PRESIDENT: I had a feeling you would .
GENERAL GREY: Sir , what happens if they do < /u ecome hostile ?
PRESIDENT: Then God help us .
DAVID: I 've got a lock on the signal pattern . We can filter it out .
MARTY: Huh ? Oh , good , hood .
DAVID: Strange thing is , if my calculations are right it 'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway . The signal reduces itself every time it recycles . Eventually it will disappear . Are you listening ?
MARTY: Can you believe this ?
DAVID: What re you talking about ?
MARTY: Have n't you been watching ?
CONSTANCE: so far the phenomenon has not caused any damage . In all likelihood it wo n't
MARTY: Feel no shame in hiding .
MECHANIC #1: Hey , Russ , heard you had a little trouble this morning . Dusted the wrong field ?
MECHANIC #2: I know , you 're probably still a little confused from your hostage experience .
MECHANIC #1: He ai n't never told you ! ? Seems years back our boy here had been kidnapped by aliens . Did all kinds of experiments on him and such . Tell him , Russ .
RUSSELL: Not today , guys . Okay . Russell gets up and heads for the door .

NIMZIKI: If we do n't strike soon , there may not be much of an America left to defend .
GENERAL GREY: What 's the latest from NORAD ?
OFFICER: It 's gone , sir . They 've taken out
NIMZIKI: That 's impossible
GENERAL GREY: My God , the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs
NIMZIKI: Mr. President , we must launch . A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities !
DAVID: You ca n't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons ?
CONSTANCE: David , do n't David pushes past her .
DAVID: If you fire nukes , so will the est of the world . Do you know what that kind of fall out will do ? How many innocent people
GENERAL GREY: Sir , i remind you that you are just a guest here
CONSTANCE: David , please
DAVID: This is insanity ! You 'll kill us and them at the same time . There 'll be nothing left !
NIMZIKI: Sit down and shut up ! Suddenly Moishe is on his feet , interrupting .
MOISHE: Do n't tell him to shut up ! You 'd all be dead , were it not for my David . You did n't do anything to prevent this !
PRESIDENT: Sir , there was n't much more we could have done . We were totally unprepared for this .
MOISHE: Do n't give me unprepared ! Since nineteen fifty whatever you guys have had that space ship , the thing you found in New Mexico .
DAVID: Dad , please
MOISHE: What was it , Roswell ? You had the space ship , the bodies , everything locked up in a bunker , the what is it , Area fifty one . That 's it ! Area fifty one . You knew and you did n't do nothing !
PRESIDENT: Regardless of what the tabloids have said , there were never any space crafts recovered by the government . Take my word for it , there is no Area 51 and no ecovered space ship .
NIMZIKI: Uh , excuse me , Mr. President , but that 's not entirely accurate .
TALL MAN: The end has come ! He speaketh his word and the end hast come ! Jasmine pulls up along side him .
JASMINE: Hop on . We 're heading out to El Toro .
TALL MAN: You can not defy what has come , it is the end !
JASMINE: Give me a hand .
TEDDY: She 's bleeding pretty bad .

REDNECK: We 're not . Give me the key . Get 'em off .
TALL MAN: You can not go against the word , other .
REDNECK: Sure I can .
JASMINE: This & quot ; bitch & quot ; was born in Alabama with a Daddy who loved to hunt . So do n't think for one second that I do n't know how to use this .
MIGUEL: Need a lift ?
STEVE: When I flew overhead , I saw some kind of base , not far . Confused , Miguel checks his map .
MIGUEL: It 's not on the map .
STEVE: Trust me , it 's there .
PRESIDENT: Why the hell was n't I told about this place ?
NIMZIKI: Two words , Mr. President . Plausible deniability .
PRESIDENT: I do n't understand . Where did all this come from ? How did this get funded ?
MOISHE: You did n't think they actually spent ten thousand dollars for a hammer and thirty thousand for a toilet seat , did you ?
MITCHELL: Mr. President , I 'd like to introduce you to Dr. Okun . He 's een heading up our research here for the last fifteen years .
OKUN: Mr. President , a real pleasure . They do n't let us out much , you you .
PRESIDENT: Yes .
OKUN: Well , I guess you 'd like to see the big tamale ? Follow me .
MOISHE: Never any space ships recovered by the government , huh ?
PRESIDENT: We 've had this for forty years and you do n't know anything about them ?
OKUN: Hell no , we know tons about them . The nearest stuff has only happened in the last few days .
PRESIDENT: People are dying out there . I do n't think & quot ; exciting & quot ; is the word I 'd choose to describe it !
OKUN: Not all too dissimilar to us . Breathes oxygen , comparable tolerances to heat , coldprobably why they 're interested in our planet . Hey , you wan na see them ?
DAVID: What kind of other means ? Hand signals , body language ?
OKUN: Some kind of extra sensory perception . Telepathy .
PRESIDENT: Can they be killed ?
OKUN: These three died in the crash . Their bodies are as frail as ou own . You just have to get past their technology , which is , I 'm sorry to say , far more advanced . The President turns to David .
PRESIDENT: You unlocked a part of that technology . You cracked thei code .
DAVID: All I did was stumble onto thei signal . I do n't know how helpful I can be
PRESIDENT: Show them what you 've discovered . Work together . We 've got to find a way to beat them .
GUARD: Sorry , Lt . Colonel , I ca n't open the gates without clearance .
STEVE: You want to see my clearance ?
OKUN: See the gizmos flashing ?
DAVID: Someone grab my laptop for me ?
OKUN: Find something interesting ?
DAVID: Maybe .
OKUN: You know , you 're really starting to make us look bad .
TECHY: They got one ! They got one , alive !
OKUN: How long has it been unconscious ?
RUSSELL: Excuse me Doctor
STEVE: Three hours .
OKUN: Get him into containment , stat .
RUSSELL: My boy is very sick , he needs immediate attention .
OKUN: He 's dying out . I want him sprayed down with saline .
RUSSELL: My boys is slipping into a diabetic coma . If you do n't do something about it right now he will die .
DR. ISAACS: O'Haver , Miller , come with me . Take us to him .
GENERAL GREY: You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency ! You knew all about this . When were you planning on informing the rest of us ! ?
NIMZIKI: It had been deemed classified .
GENERAL GREY: Christ , why did n't you say anything about this when they first arrived ? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots !
PRESIDENT: Atlanta , Chicago and Philadelphia , destroyed ?
GENERAL GREY: And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami , Ft. Worth , And Memphis .
PRESIDENT: And our forces ?
GENERAL GREY: We 're down to approximately fifteen percent , Sir . If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on , we 're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours .
PRESIDENT: We 're being exterminated .
MITCHELL: Mr. President , this is Lt . Colonel Steven Hill .
PRESIDENT: Lieutenant , congratulations .
STEVE: Thank you , sir .
PRESIDENT: Where is the prisoner now ?
MITCHELL: We have him in isolation . The doctors are very hopeful he will survive .
PRESIDENT: I 'd like to see him .

STEVE: General , I 'm anxious to get back to El Toro .
GENERAL GREY: Did n't anyone tell you ? I 'm sorry . El Toro was destroyed in the attack . Steve is shattered , he had no idea .
JASMINE: These should last us a while .

MARGARET: I thought you did n't recognize me .
JASMINE: Did n't want to say anything . I voted for the other guy .
OKUN: Everyone ready ?
OKUN: Do we have life support monitors ecording ?
MITCHELL: Open the door . Get him out of there . Suspicious , General Grey stops him .
GENERAL GREY: Wait . Can you hear me ?
SOLIDER: What the hell are you doing ? Get out of there !
STEVE: I 'm just going to borrow it . The Soldier pulls out his pistol , taking aim .
SOLIDER: No you 're not , sir .
STEVE: You really want to shoot me ?
SOLDIER: Shit . I 'm gon na catch the hell fo this .

DAVID: I 'm making a mess .
MOISHE: This I can see .
DAVID: We 've got ta burn the rain forest , Pops . Dump toxic waste , pollute the air , rip up the ozone . Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they wo n't want it anymore .
MOISHE: David , you 're drunk .
DAVID: Pops , you 're a genius !
MOISHE: What 'd I say ?
DAVID: A cold ? Of course .
NIMZIKI: All right , Connie , we 're here . What 's this all about ?
CONSTANCE: I really have no idea . He just said to bring everyone down here . Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft .
DYLAN: Does that thing fly in oute space ? Steve loos up at the craft admiringly .
STEVE: It certainly does .
DAVID: Could anyone please step back away from the craft ?
MITCHELL: What ?
DAVID: From where you 're standing , do you think you could shoot that can off the alien craft ?
NIMZIKI: We know that already . What 's you point ?
DAVID: My point is if we ca n't beat thei defenses , then we must get around < /u them .
GENERAL GREY: How did you do that ?
DAVID: I gave it a cold .
GENERAL GREY: Are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields ?
DAVID: Just as they used our satellites against us , we can use their own signal against them .
NIMZIKI: And just how do we infect the & quot ; Mother Ship & quot ; with a virus ?
DAVID: We 'll have to fly their craft out of our atmosphere and dock with the mother ship .
NIMZIKI: This is ridiculous .
GENERAL GREY: How long would their shields be down ?
DAVID: Once they discover the virus it could be a matter of minutes .
NIMZIKI: You want us to co-ordinate a massive world wide counter strike with a window of only a few minutes ?
GENERAL GREY: With their shields down it might e possible .
NIMZIKI: Please , you 're not buying into any of this nonsense , are you ? We do n't have the manpower or the esources to launch that kind of a campaign . Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate .
STEVE: I 've seen them in action . I 've watched their maneuvers . With your permission , sir , I 'd like the opportunity to try .
NIMZIKI: That thing 's a wreck . It crash landed back in the fifties ! We do n't even know if it 's capable of flying . David turns to the Technicians .
DAVID: Remove the clamps !
PRESIDENT: Let 's do it .
NIMZIKI: I understand that you 're upset over the death of your wife but that 's no excuse for making another fatal mistake
PRESIDENT: The only mistake I made was appointing a sniveling little weasel like you Chief of Staff .
GENERAL GREY: Yes , Sir . He storms off leaving everyone stunned .
NIMZIKI: He ca n't do that .
CONSTANCE: He just did .
REGINALD: we 've been told that there may e additional re-enforcement in hiding near the Golan Straights
THOMSON: Seems they 're getting a signal . One Morse code .
REGINALD: I still get believe this .
THOMSON: The Iraqis do n't appear altogethe too pleased with this arrangement .
REGINALD: How do you think the Israelis feel ?
THOMSON: It 's from the Americans . They want to organize a counte offensive .
REGINALD: It 's about bloody time . What do they plan to do ?
RUSSIAN #1: They claims to be able to bring down their shields .
RUSSIAN #2: When do they want to attack ?
JAPANESE PILOT: The attack begins in thirteen hours .
PRESIDENT: How 're we doing ?
GENERAL GREY: Better than we thought .
PRESIDENT: And our troops here ?
GENERALE GREY: We 've been collecting planes from all over but
PRESIDENT: But what , General ?
GENERAL GREY: Pilots , sir . We do n't have enough people to get them in the air .
PRESIDENT: Then find them .
MIGUEL: How ' he doing ?
RUSSELL: Just fell asleep . He 's gon na be just fine . Join me in a little celebration ?
OFFICER: We 're planning to launch a counter offensive Russell wanders over towards them . OFFICER with our depleted manpower we must ask that anyone with any flight experience come forward . Military training is preferable ut anyone who can fly a plane could be useful Russell pushes his way through the crowd .
RUSSELL: I can fly , I mean , I 'm a pilot .
OFFICER: Sorry , sir . Russell gets into his face , desperate .
RUSSELL: You do n't understand . I 've got ta e part of this . This is important to me . They ruined my life .
OFFICER: Why do n't you go somewhere and sleep it off .
MITCHELL: We 've hid the launcher in the ship 's manifold .
STEVE: It 's just like an AMRAAM launch pad on the stealths .
MITCHELL: Exactly . Use it the same way . Only the nuke wo n't detonate on impact . You 'll have anothe thirty seconds to get as far away as you can .
DAVID: I 'll see how they 're doing with the radio transmitter .
STEVE: Oh shit , we 're late .
DAVID: We 'll meet you there .
CONSTANCE: Thirty seconds ? Is n't that cutting it a little too close ?
DAVID: We 'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off .
TECHNICIAN: It 's the strongest SHF transmitte we could get . It 'll tell us when you 've uploaded the virus .
DAVID: Then cross your fingers the shields go down .
CONSTANCE: With you ? I do n't understand why you ca n't just show someone how to plant the virus , somebody trained for this kind of mission ?
DAVID: If anything goes wrong I 'll have to think quickly , adjust the signal , who knows ?
CONSTANCE: Now he gets ambitious .
DYLAN: It 's too tight .
JASMINE: I had to borrow it . I guess that 's good enough . Jasmine stands , turns to Dylan .
STEVE: You know me
JASMINE: I know , you like to make a big entrance . Steve moves next to Jasmine , takes her hand .
STEVE: Before we do this , I want you to know I 'm sorry .
JASMINE: Sorry for what ?
STEVE: I should have done this a long long time ago .
CHAPLAIN: Witnesses ?
GENERAL GREY: Beggars ca n't be choosers , sir .
PRESIDENT: Good morning . In less than one hour planes from here and all around the world will launch the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind Mankind . The word has new meaning for all of us now . We are eminded not of our petty differences but of our common interests .
GENERAL GREY: Mr. President , just what do you think you 're doing ?
PRESIDENT: I 'm a pilot , Will . This is where I belong . General Grey wants to argue but ca n't .
STEVE: When I 'm back we 'll light those fireworks .
MOISHE: David , take these .
DAVID: Thanks , Pops .
MOISHE: I want you should know , I 'm very proud of you , son .
CONSTANCE: Be careful .
STEVE: Damn it . We ca n't go yet . I got ta find some cigars .
MOISHE: My last two . With my blessings .
STEVE: You 're a lifesaver .
DAVID: I have a confession to make . I 'm not real big on flying .
STEVE: Great .
DAVID: What the hell are you doing ?
STEVE: Just getting a feel for her .
PRESIDENT: Grey , you read me ?
GENERAL GREY: Roger , Eagle One , our primary target has shifted course .
PRESIDENT: Where 's it headed ?
GENERAL GREY: I think our secret is out . They 're headed right for us .
STEVE: You still with me ?
DAVID: That 's it . Head straight for it .
STEVE: Something 's happening . It 's not esponding .
DAVID: I was counting on that . They 're inging us in .
PRESIDENT: We have visual .
GENERAL GREY: Do not engage until we 've confirmed the package has been delivered .
PRESIDENT: Roger .
CONSTANCE: What if that thing gets here efore we can plant the virus ?
MITCHELL: The entire compound is buried deep within the mountain . It should give us some protection .
CONSTANCE: But what about all the people outside ?
DAVID: Must be thousands of them . What are they doing ?
STEVE: Looks like they 're preparing the invasion .
DAVID: These things are fully equipped . Reclining bucket seats , powe windows A BLAST SHIELD lowers covering the window .
MITCHELL: He 's uploading the virus .
GENERAL GREY: Eagle One
PRESIDENT: Roger .
PHILIP: Let me get that .
MIGUEL: Where 's Russell ?
CONSTANCE: Hurry , we 've got to get everyone inside .
DAVID: The virus is in . All we can do now is pray .
GENERAL GREY: Delivery complete . Engage .
PRESIDENT: Roger .
GENERAL GREY: Keep your fingers crossed .
PRESIDENT: Come on , baby .
GENERAL GREY: It did n't work . Disengage . Sir , get your people out of there .
PRESIDENT: Not yet !
GENERAL GREY: You did it ! A direct hit !
PRESIDENT: We 're going in ! Squadron leaders , take point .
MIGUEL: Russell !
DAVID: Get us out of here !
STEVE: I ca n't shake her free .
DAVID: It 's not me . They 're overriding the system .
STEVE: Damn !
DAVID: Check and mate .
NIMZIKI: I 'm not Jewish .
MOISHE: It 's okay .
ALICIA: This could be our last night on Earth . I do n't want to die a virgin .
PHILIP: If we do , we 'll both die virgins . But at last we 'll be together . Alicia smiles , a nice guy at last .
OFFICER: We 're running out of missiles , Sir . We 're just not causing enough damage .
GENERAL GREY: They 're getting ready to fire the ig gun . You 're going to have to find a vulnerable spot , fast .
PRESIDENT: I 've got an idea . Keep 'em off my tail .
GENERAL GREY: We 're out of time . Get out of there ! Get as far away as you can .
PRESIDENT: Does n't anyone have any damned missiles left ? !
RUSSELL: It 's okay , Sir . I 'm packin ' .
OFFICER: Who is that guy ?
MIGUEL: Russell !
RUSSELL: tell my children I love them very much .
MIGUEL: Dad ! No !
RUSSELL: I 've got to , kid . You were always etter at taking care of them than I was anyways .
GENERAL GREY: Let 's get on the wire . Tell every squadron around the world how to shoot those fuckers down .
STEVE: I guess there 's nothing left to do . Let 's nuke 'em .
DAVID: Funny , I always thought things like these would kill me . They share a quick sober laugh .
STEVE: Nice meeting you .
DAVID: You as well . Steve lights his cigar , then lights David 's .
STEVE: Ready ?
DAVID: Not a chance in hell .
STEVE: We 're loose !
DAVID: Does n't matter . Game 's over .
STEVE: I do n't hear no fat lady . Steve THROTTLES IT . The craft JOLTS AWAY .
JASMINE: Any word from Steve ?
STEVE: Yeah , but what an entrance !
JASMINE: Dick-weed .
STEVE: Butt-munch .
CONSTANCE: Are you all right ?
DAVID: Did it work ?
CONSTANCE: You bet it did . She hugs him . They kiss .
PRESIDENT: We 're getting reports from all over . Their ships are going down !
STEVE: Did n't I promise you fireworks ?

PANAMA HAT: Small world , Doctor Jones .

PANAMA HAT: This is the second time I 've had to reclaim my property from you—
INDY: That belongs in a museum—
PANAMA HAT: So do you . Throw him over the side .
INDY: the search for fact . Not truth . If it 's truth you 're interested in , Doctor Tyree 's Philosophy class is right down the hall . Laughter .
BRODY: You 've got itl
INDY: You know how long I 've been looking for that ? !
BRODY: All your life .
INDY: All my life !
BRODY: Well done , Indy . Very well done , indeed This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection .
INDY: We can discuss my honorarium ove dinner and champagne tonight .
BRODY: Yes . My treat .
INDY: Shush ! Shush ! Shushl
IRENE: Doctor Jones ! I 'm so glad you 're ack ! Your mail is on your desk . Here are your phone messages .
MALE STUDENT: Doctor Jones , you promised Doctor Jones—
IRENE: This is your appointment schedule . And these term papers still have n't een graded .
INDY: Okay . Irene , put everyone 's name on a list , in the order they arrived , and I 'll see each and every one of them in turn .
INDY: `` Venice , Italy . ''
MAN: Doctor Jones ?
DONOVAN: I trust your trip down was comfortable , Doctor Jones . My men did n't alarm you , I hope . He shakes hands with INDY .
INDY: I know who you are Mr. Donovan . Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous . Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive .
DONOVAN: Well , like yourself , Doctor Jones , I have a passion for antiquities . Have a look over here . This might interest you .
INDY: Well , it 's sandstone . Christian symbol . Early Latin text . Mid- Twelfth Century , I should think .
DONOVAN: That was our assessment as well .
INDY: Where did this come from ?
DONOVAN: My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper . Can you translate the inscription ?
INDY: `` who drinks the water I shall give him , says the Lord , will have a spring inside him welling up for eternal life . Let them bring me to your holy mountain in the place where you dwell .
DONOVAN: The Holy Grail , Doctor Jones . The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper . The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea .
INDY: The Arthur Legend . I 've heard this bedtime story before .
DONOVAN: Eternal life , Doctor Jones ! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail . Oh , now that 's a bedtime story I 'd like to wake up to !
INDY: An old man 's dream .
DONOVAN: Every man 's dream . Including your father 's , I believe .
INDY: Grail lore is his hobby . He 's a teacher of Medieval Literature . The one the students hope they do n't get .
MRS. DONOVAN: Walter , you 're neglecting ou guests .
DONOVAN: Be along in a moment , dear .
INDY: What good is it ? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons . Pretty vague . Where do you start looking ? Maybe if the Tablet were intact , you 'd have something to go on . But the entire top portion is missing .
DONOVAN: Just the same , an attempt to ecover the Grail is currently underway .
INDY: I 've heard this one as well . Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France . But only one of them made it . And efore dying of extreme old age , he supposedly imparted his tale to a—to a Franciscan friar , I think .
DONOVAN: Not `` supposedly , '' Doctor Jones .
INDY: That 's usually when the ground falls out from underneath you feet .
DONOVAN: You could be more right than you know .
INDY: Yes ?
DONOVAN: We 've hit a snag . our project leader has vanished . Along with all his research . Uh , we received a cable from his colleague , Docto Schneider , who has no idea of his whereabouts or what 's become of him . I want you to pick up the trail where he left off . Find the man and you will find the Grail .
INDY: You 've got the wrong Jones , Miste Donovan . Why do n't you try my father ?
DONOVAN: We already have . Your father is the man who 's disappeared .
BRODY: Your father and I have been friends since time began . I 've watched you grow up , Indy . And I 've watched the two of you grow apart . I 've never seen you this concerned about him before .
INDY: Dad ? He 's an academic A bookworm . He 's not a field mans
BRODY: Dear God . They walk into the room .
INDY: I do n't know . But whatever it is , he 's in over his head !
BRODY: It 's today 's mail . And it 's been opened .
INDY: Mail ! That 's it , Marcus !
BRODY: What is it ?
INDY: It 's Dad 's Grail Diary . Every clue he ever followed . Every discovery he made . A complete ecord of his search for the Holy Grail . This is his whole life . Why would he have sent this to me ?
BRODY: I do n't know . But someone must want it pretty badly .
INDY: Do you believe , Marcus ?
BRODY: The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us .
INDY: Call Donovan , Marcus . Tell him I 'll take that ticket to Venice now .
BRODY: I 'll tell him we 'll take two .
DONOVAN: Do n't worry . Doctor Schneider will e there to meet you .
BRODY: Schneider ?
DONOVAN: I maintain an apartment in Venice , at your disposal .
BRODY: Oh , well . That 's good . Thank you .
DONOVAN: Doctor Jones . Good luck . Be very careful . Do n't trust anvbody .
INDY: Ah , Venice
BRODY: Yes . Uh , how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him ?
INDY: I do n't know . Maybe he 'll know us .
ELSA: Doctor Jones ?
INDY: Yes ?
ELSA: I knew it was you—
INDY: And my mother 's ears . But the est belongs to you .
ELSA: Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for .
BRODY: That 's right .
ELSA: Doctor Elsa Schneider .
BRODY: Uh how do you do ?
ELSA: The last time I saw your fathe we were in the library . He was very close to tracking down the Knight 's Tomb . I 've never seen him so excited . He was as giddy as a schoolboy .
INDY: Who ? Attila the Professor ? He was never giddy , even when he was a schoolboy !
ELSA: I usually do n't .
INDY: I usually do n't either .
ELSA: In that case , I permit you . INDY gives her the flower .
INDY: It would make me very happy .
ELSA: But I 'm already sad—by tomorrow it will have faded .
INDY: Tomorrow I 'll steal you another .
BRODY: I hate to interrupt you—but the eason we 're here—
ELSA: Yes . I have something to show you . She hands a slip of paper to INDY .
INDY: Roman numerals .
ELSA: Here is the library .
INDY: That does n't look much like a library .
BRODY: It looks like a converted church . ELSA leads the way inside .
ELSA: In this case it 's the literal truth . We 're on holy ground . These columns over here
INDY: Marcus—I 've seen this window efore .
BRODY: Where ?
INDY: Right here . In Dad 's Diary . You see ?
BRODY: Look , Indy . The Roman numerals !
INDY: Dad was onto something here !
BRODY: Well , now we know the source of the numbers , but we still do n't know what they mean .
INDY: My dad sent me this Diary for a eason . Until we find out why , I suggest we keep it to ourselves .
ELSA: Find something ?
BRODY: Uh , yes . Three , seven and tent That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals .
ELSA: My God , I must be blind
INDY: Dad was n't looking for a book about the Knight 's Tomb he was looking for the Tomb itself ELSA wears a blank expression .
ELSA: You do n't disappoint , Doctor Jones . You 're a great deal like you father .
INDY: Except he 's lost , and I 'm not .
ELSA: Lower me down .
INDY: Look after this for me , will you ? Then INDY disappears into the hole .
ELSA: Pagan symbols . Fourth or Fifth Century .
INDY: Right . Six hundred years before the Crusades .
ELSA: The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later .
INDY: That 's right . If there 's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here , that 's where we 'll find him .
BRODY: Ohhhh . . .
ELSA: What 's this one ?
INDY: The Ark of the Covenant .
ELSA: Are you sure ?
INDY: Pretty sure .
ELSA: Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork . One coffin is elevated above the others .
INDY: This is itl we found it ! Look— the engraving on the Shield . It 's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker !
ELSA: What 's that ?
INDY: It 's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet .
ELSA: Just like your father—giddy as a schoolboy . INDY laughs .
INDY: He never would have made it past the rats ! He hates rats ! He 's scared to death of them !
ELSA: What ?
INDY: I think I 've found a way out . Deep breath .
ELSA: Go between them ? Are you crazy ? !
INDY: I said go around !
ELSA: You said go between them !
INDY: I said do n't go between them !
ELSA: No ! !
INDY: Why are you trying to kill us ?
KAZIM: Because you 're looking for the Holy Grail .
INDY: My father was looking for the Holy Grail . Did you kill him too ?
KAZIM: No .
INDY: Where is he ? Talk—or you 're dead . Damn it , tell me ! Tell me !
KAZIM: If you do n't let go , Doctor Jones , we 'll both die .
INDY: Then we 'll die .
KAZIM: My soul is prepared . How 's yours ?
INDY: This is your last chance .
KAZIM: No , Doctor Jones . It 's yours !
INDY: All right ! Where 's my fathe
KAZIM: If you let me go , I will tell you where he is .
INDY: Who are you ?
KAZIM: My name is Kazim .
INDY: And why were you trying to kill me ?
KAZIM: The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years . And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe .
INDY: I did n't come for the Cup of Christ . I came to find my father .
KAZIM: In that case , God be with you in your quest . Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border . KAZIM walks away .
INDY: How 's the head ?
BRODY: It 's better , now I 've seen this . It 's the name of a city . `` Alexandretta ? '' Hmmm
INDY: The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year . The entire city was destroyed .
BRODY: Your father would know . You father did know . Look . He made a map . BRODY picks up the Grail Diary .
INDY: Alexandretta . Now we know .
BRODY: Yes . Now we know .
INDY: Marcus , get hold of Sallah . Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun .
BRODY: What about you ?
INDY: I 'm going after Dad .
ELSA: My room !
INDY: Mine , too .
ELSA: What were they looking for ?
INDY: This .
ELSA: The Grail Diary .
INDY: Uh-huh .
ELSA: You had it ? You did n't trust me !
INDY: I did n't know you . She 's awfully hard to resist .
ELSA: Oh , yes . Give them a flower and they 'll follow you anywhere .
INDY: Knock it off . You 're not mad .
ELSA: No ?
INDY: No . You like the way I do things .
ELSA: It 's lucky I do n't do things the same way . You 'd still be standing at the Venice pier .
INDY: Look , what do you think is going on here ? Since I 've met you , I 've nearly been incinerated , drowned , shot at , and chopped into fish bait . We 're caught in the middle of something sinister here . My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for . And until I 'm sure , I 'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done .
ELSA: How dare you kiss me ! Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him .
INDY: Leave me alone . I do n't like fast women .
ELSA: And I hate arrogant men . INDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed .
INDY: Ahh , Venice .
ELSA: I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors .
INDY: Do n't know . Think of something .
BUTLER: Yes ?
INDY: And not before time ! Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day ? We 're drenched !
BUTLER: Are you expected ?
INDY: Do n't take that tone with me , my good man . Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries .
BUTLER: Tapestries ?
INDY: Dear me , the man is dense . This is a castle , is n't it ? There are tapestries ?
BUTLER: This is a castle . And we have many tapestries . But if you 're a Scottish lord , then I am Mickey Mouse .
INDY: How dare he ? !
ELSA: How do you know ? INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE .
INDY: Because it 's wired .
ELSA: Indy ? Indy ? INDY reassures her .
INDY: Do n't worry this is kid 's play . I 'll be right back .
HENRY: Junior ? INDY gets to his feet .
INDY: Yes , sirl
HENRY: It is you Junior !
INDY: Do n't call me that , please .
HENRY: But what are you doing here ?
INDY: I came to get you ! What do you think ?
HENRY: Late Fourteenth Century , Ming Dynasty .
INDY: And the head . You hit me , Dad !
HENRY: I 'll never forgive myself—
INDY: Do n't worry—I 'm fine .
HENRY: Thank God !
INDY: No ! Dad , get your stuff . We 've got to get out of here .
HENRY: Well , I am sorry about your head , though . But I thought you were one of them .
INDY: Dad , they come in through the doors .
HENRY: Good point . INDY steps to the door and stands , listening .
INDY: I got it and I used it . We found the entrance to the catacombs .
HENRY: Through the library ?
INDY: Right .
HENRY: I knew it . And the tomb of Si Richard ?
INDY: Found it .
HENRY: He was actually there ? You saw him ?
INDY: Well , what was left of him .
HENRY: And his shield the inscription on Sir Richard 's shield ?
INDY: Alexandretta .
HENRY: Alexandretta of course on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire . Oh , Junior
INDY: No , Dad . You did . Forty years .
HENRY: If only I could have been with you .
INDY: There were rats , Dad .
HENRY: Rats ?
INDY: Yeah . big ones . What do the Nazis want with you Dad ?
HENRY: They want my diary .
INDY: Yeah ?
HENRY: I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could .
INDY: Yeah . . .
S.S. OFFICER: Doctor Jones ! !
HENRY: You doltl Do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my Diary all the way back here ?
INDY: Well , uh
HENRY: You did ! !
INDY: Look , can we discuss this later ?
HENRY: I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers .
INDY: Will you take it easy . !
HENRY: Take it easy ? ! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place ? So it would n't fall into thei hands ! !
INDY: I came here to save you .
HENRY: Oh yeah ? And who 's gon na come to save you , Junior ? ?
INDY: I told you
HENRY: Look what you did ! ! Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead .
INDY: Elsa ? Elsa ? He opens a door and enters
VOGEL: That 's far enough Put down the gun , Doctor Jones . Put down the gun or the Fraulein dies .
HENRY: But she 's one of them !
ELSA: Indy , please !
HENRY: She 's a Nazi !
INDY: What ? !
HENRY: Trust me !
ELSA: Indy , no !
VOGEL: I will kill her !
HENRY: Oh yeah ? Go ahead !
INDY: No ! Do n't Shoot !
HENRY: Do n't worry . He wo n't .
ELSA: Indy , please ! Do what he says !
HENRY: And do n't listen to her !
VOGEL: Enough ! She diesl
INDY: Wait ! Waitl
ELSA: I 'm sorry . INDY comforts her .
INDY: No , do n't be .
ELSA: But you should have listened to your father .
INDY: She ransacked her own room and I fell for it . How did you know she was a Nazi ?
HENRY: Umh ?
INDY: How did you she was a Nazi ?
HENRY: She talks in her sleep .
INDY: Donovan
DONOVAN: Did n't I warn you not to trust anybody , Doctor Jones ?
HENRY: I misjudged you Walter—I knew you 'd sell your mother for an Etruscan vase . But I did n't know you 'd sell you country and your soul to the slime of humanity .
DONOVAN: Doctor Schneider There 're pages torn out of thisl
ELSA: This book contained a map—a map with no names—precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon .
INDY: So it did .
DONOVAN: Where are these missing pages ? This maps we must have these pages backs
ELSA: You 're wasting your breath . He wo n't tell us . And he does n't have to it 's perfectly obvious where the pages are he 's given them to Marcus Brody . HENRY now wears a pained expression .
HENRY: Marcus ? ! You did n't drag poo Marcus along , did you ? He 's not up to the challenge .
DONOVAN: He sticks out like a sore thumb . We 'll find him .
INDY: The hell you will . He 's got a two-day head-start on you , which is more than he needs . Brody 's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan . He speaks a dozen languages , knows every local custom . He 'll blend in . Disappear . You 'll never see him again . With any luck , he 's got the Grail already . HENRY looks amazed and impressed .
BRODY: Does anyone here speak English ? Or even ancient Greek ?
SALLAH: Mister Brodyl They meet and hug , then begin to walk .
BRODY: Oh , Sallahl What a relief !
SALLAH: Marcus Brody , sir . And where is Indy ?
BRODY: Oh , he 's in Austria . A slight detour .
SALLAH: You are on your own ?
BRODY: Yes , but do n't panic . Everything 's under control . Have you . . .have you arranged our supplies ?
SALLAH: Oh , yes , of course . But where are we going ?
BRODY: Oh , this map will show you . It was drawn by , uh
SINISTER MAN: Mister Brody ?
BRODY: Oh , what ? your servant , sir .
SALLAH: And I am his .
SINISTER MAN: Follow me , please .
BRODY: My reputation precedes me .
SALLAH: There is no museum in Iskenderun .
SECOND MAN: Papers please .
SALLAH: Papers ? Of course .
BRODY: Yes .
SALLAH: Papers , sir . Got it here . SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper .
BRODY: Yes .
SALLAH: Egyptian Mail . Morning edition . Run !
BRODY: Did you say ? Uh , uh
SALLAH: Run !
HENRY: Intolerable .
VOGEL: Doctor Schneider . Message from Berlin . You must return immediately a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture .
ELSA: So ?
VOGEL: Your presence on the platform is equested at the highest level .
ELSA: Thank you , Herr Oberst . I will meet you at Iskenderun .
DONOVAN: Take this Diary to the Reich Museum in Berlin . It will show them our progress , ahead of schedule . Without a map , I 'm afraid it 's no better than a souvenir . He hands her the Grail Diary .
VOGEL: Let me kill them now .
ELSA: No . If we fail to recover the pages from Brody , we 'll need them alive .
DONOVAN: Always do what the doctor orders .
ELSA: Do n't look at me like that—we oth wanted the Grail , I would have done anything to get it . You would have done the same . INDY shakes his head `` no . ''
INDY: I 'm sorry you think so .
ELSA: I ca n't forget how wonderful it was .
HENRY: Thank you . It was rather wonderful .
VOGEL: Doctor Schneider ! Your car is waiting .
ELSA: That 's how Austrians say goodbye .
VOGEL: And this is how we say goodbye in Germany , Doctor Jones .
HENRY: Ohh . . . VOGEL exits . INDY shakes his head clear .
INDY: Ooooh I like the Austrian way etter .
HENRY: So did I .
INDY: Let 's try and get these ropes loose . We 've got to get to Marcus efore the Nazis do !
HENRY: You said he had two days ' start . That he would blend in . Disappear !
INDY: Are you kidding ? —I made that up ! You know Marcus—he got lost once in his own museum !
HENRY: What am I looking for ?
INDY: My lucky charm .
HENRY: Feels like a cigarette lighter .
INDY: Try and burn through the ropes .
HENRY: Very good .
INDY: Do n't get sentimental now Dad— save it 'til we get out of here .
HENRY: The floor 's on fire ! See ? !
INDY: What ? ? ?
HENRY: And the chair .
INDY: All right , movel Move ! Rock your Chair . Do what I do .
LIEUTENANT: Etwas wichtig , mein Herr .
DONOVAN: Well , we have Marcus Brody . But more important , we have the map .
RADIO OPERATOR: Aus Berlin , mein Herr .
DONOVAN: `` By the personal command of the Fuhrer . Secrecy essential to success . Eliminate the American conspirators . '' Germany has declared war on the Jones boys . Los fahren . The car drives off .
INDY: Dad !
HENRY: What ?
INDY: Dad !
HENRY: What ?
INDY: Dad !
HENRY: What ?
INDY: Head for the fireplace !
HENRY: Oh .
INDY: I think I can get these ropes off .
HENRY: Our situation has not improved . INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY .
INDY: Listen Dad I 'm almost free .
WOMAN: Alarm ! Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY .
HENRY: This is intolerable !
INDY: I 'm out , Dad !
HENRY: Well done , boy !
INDY: Come on Dad .
HENRY: I find that if I just sit down and think
INDY: Dad !
HENRY: the solution presents itself . HENRY follows INDY down the staircase .
INDY: Great . More boats .
HENRY: Would you say this has been just another typical day for you ? Huh ?
INDY: Ooofl No ! It 's been better than most .
HENRY: What about the boat ? We 're not going on the boat ?
VOGEL: Sie alle ins Boat . Schnell !
INDY: Ha !
GUARD: Halt ! Halt !
HENRY: Stop !
INDY: What ?
HENRY: Stop ! Stop ! The motorbike skids to a stop .
INDY: Brody 's this way .
HENRY: My Diary 's in Berlin .
INDY: You do n't need the Diary , Dad . Marcus has the map .
HENRY: There is more in the Diary than just the map .
INDY: All right Dad—tell me .
HENRY: Well , he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge .
INDY: What final challenge ?
HENRY: Three devices of such lethal cunning .
INDY: Booby traps ?
HENRY: Oh , yes . But I found the clues that will safely take us through , in the Chronicles of St. Anselm .
INDY: But what are they ? Ca n't you emember ?
HENRY: I wrote them down in my Diary so that I would n't have to remembe
INDY: Half the German Army 's on ou tail and you want me to go to Berlin ? Into the lion 's den ?
HENRY: Yes ! The only thing that matters is the Grail .
INDY: What about Marcus ?
HENRY: Marcus would agree with me .
INDY: Two selfless martyrs . Jesus Christl
HENRY: That 's for blasphemy . The quest for the Grail is not archaeology . It 's a race against evil . If it is captured by the Nazis , the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth . Do you understand me ?
INDY: This is an obsession Dad . I neve understood it . Never . Neithe did Mom .
HENRY: Oh yes , she did . Only too well . Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her .
INDY: Fraulein Doctor . Where is it ?
ELSA: How did you get here ?
INDY: Where is it ? I want it .
ELSA: You came back for the book ? Whv ?
INDY: My father did n't want it incinerated .
ELSA: Is that what you think of me ? I believe in the Grail , not the Swastika .
INDY: Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for—who gives a damn what you think ?
ELSA: You do .
INDY: All I have to do is squeeze .
ELSA: All I have to do is scream .
INDY: I 've got it . Let 's get the hell out of here .
HENRY: What did you get ?
INDY: I do n't know . The first available flight out of Germany .
HENRY: Good .
INDY: Well , we made it . HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY .
HENRY: When we 're airborne , with Germany ehind us , then I 'll share that sentiment .
INDY: Relax .
VOGEL: Nicht zumachen ! Wir steigen ein !
FEMALE PASSENGER: Nein .
MALE PASSENGER: Nein . VOGEL turns to see
INDY: Fahrscheine meine Herr .
VOGEL: Weg .
INDY: Tickets please . HENRY looks confused .
VOGEL: Was ?
INDY: No ticket .
VOGEL: Du wirst nochmal boren von mir !
HENRY: You know , sharing your adventures is an interesting experience .
INDY: That 's not all we shared . It 's disgraceful . You 're old enough to e her fa-er , her grandfather !
HENRY: Well , I 'm as human as the next man .
INDY: I was the next man .
HENRY: Ships that pass in the night
INDY: Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink ? I had a milk shake .
HENRY: Hmmm What did we talk about ?
INDY: We did n't talk . We never talked .
HENRY: And do I detect a rebuke ?
INDY: A regret . It was just the two of us , Dad . It was a lonely way to grow up . For you , too . If you had been an ordinary , average father like the other guys ' dads , you 'd have understood that .
HENRY: Actually , I was a wonderful father .
INDY: When ? HENRY looks up from his Diary .
HENRY: Did I ever tell you to eat up ? Go to bed ? Wash your ears ? Do your homework ? No . I respected your privacy and I taught you self- eliance .
INDY: What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country . And I learned it so well that we 've hardly spoken for twenty years .
HENRY: You left just when you were ecoming interesting .
INDY: Dad , how can you ?
HENRY: Very well . I 'm here now .
INDY: Well I ca n't think of anything .
HENRY: Then what are you complaining about ? Look , we have work to do . When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges . `` First , the breath of God . Only the penitent man will pass . Second , the Word of God , only in the footsteps of God will he proceed . Third , the Path of God , only in the leap from the lion 's head will he prove his worth. ``
INDY: What does that mean ?
HENRY: I do n't know . We 'll find out .
INDY: They 're turning around . They 're taking us back to Germany .
HENRY: I did n't know you could fly a plane .
INDY: Flyyes . Landno .
HENRY: What happens at eleven o'clock ?
INDY: Twelve—eleven—ten . Eleven o'clock . Fire !
HENRY: More or less .
INDY: Hang on , Dads We 're going in ! HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat .
HENRY: Nice landing .
INDY: Thanks . Suddenly , INDY 's attention is directed to
HENRY: Those people are trying to kill us !
INDY: I know , Dadl
HENRY: It 's a new experience for me .
INDY: It happens to me all the time .
HENRY: This is intolerable !
INDY: This could be close .
HENRY: Faster , boy faster !
INDY: Dad , he 's coming back . INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to
HENRY: I suddenly remembered Charlemagne . `` Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky . ''
DONOVAN: These pages are taken from Professo Jones ' diary , Your Highness . And they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the Grail .
SULTAN: What have you brought ?
VOGEL: Bring den Schatzl
DONOVAN: Precious valuables , Your Highness , `` donated '' by some of the finest families in all of Germany .
SULTAN: Rolls-Royce Phantom Two . 4.3 litre , 30 horsepower , six cylinde engine , with Stromberg Downdraft carburetor .
DONOVAN: The keys are in the ignition , Your Highness .
SULTAN: You shall have camels , horses , an armed escort , provisions , desert vehicles—and tanksl
DONOVAN: You 're welcome .
ELSA: We have no time to lose . Indiana Jones and his father have escaped .
SALLAH: We go this way .
INDY: What happened to Marcus , Sallah ?
SALLAH: Ah , they set out across the desert this afternoon . I believe they took Mister Brody with them . HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it .
HENRY: Now they have the map ! And in this sort of race , there 's no silver medal for finishing second .
DONOVAN: Care to wet your whistle , Marcus ?
BRODY: I 'd rather spit in your face . But as I have n't got any spit
VOGEL: We must be within three or fou miles . Otherwise we are off the map .
DONOVAN: Well , Marcus , we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind .
BRODY: You 're meddling with powers you can not possibly comprehend .
INDY: Ah , I see Brody . He seems okay . They 've got a tank . Six-pound gun .
HENRY: What do you think you 're doing ? ! Get down !
INDY: Dad , we 're well out of range .
SALLAH: That car belonged to my brother- in-law .
INDY: Come oncome on !
VOGEL: I ca n't see anyone up there .
DONOVAN: Maybe it was n't even Jones .
ELSA: No . It 's him all right . He 's here somewhere .
DONOVAN: Put Brody in the tank .
HENRY: Now , who are all these people ?
INDY: Who cares ? As long as they 're keeping Donovan busy . Dad , you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation .
SALLAH: I 'll take the camels .
INDY: I do n't need camels .
SALLAH: But , Indy—
INDY: No camels !
DONOVAN: Who is he ?
KAZIM: A messenger from God . For the unrighteous , the Cup of Life holds everlasting damnation . KAZIM dies .
HENRY: Marcus !
BRODY: Arghhh ! Oh !
HENRY: `` Genius of the Restoration— ''
BRODY: `` —aid our own resuscitation ! '' They exchange a handshake .
HENRY: It 's a rescue , old boys Come on .
VOGEL: Search him .
HENRY: It tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself should try eading books instead of burning them . DONOVAN appears at the turret cover .
DONOVAN: Colonel ? Jones is getting away .
VOGEL: I think not , Herr Donovan .
DONOVAN: Not that Jones—the other Jones !
NAZI SOLDIER: Herr Colonel !
INDY: Sallah , I said no camels ! That 's five camels . Ca n't you Count ?
SALLAH: Compensation for my brother-in- law 's car . Indy , your father and Brody—
INDY: Where 's my father ?
SALLAH: They have them . In the belly of that steel beast .
VOGEL: Fire !
NAZI SOLDIER: Keine Bewegung . He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY .
INDY: Dad ! Dad ! Dad !
HENRY: Junior ? Junior ? Junior !
INDY: Dad ! He drops the gun down into the tank .
PERISCOPE SOLDIER: Diese Amerikane . Sie Kampfen wie Weiber .
BRODY: Henry , the pen—
HENRY: What ?
BRODY: But do n't you see ? The pen is mightier than the sword .
HENRY: It 's war .
INDY: Dad ?
HENRY: You call this archaeology ?
INDY: Get out of there , Dad !
BRODY: How does one get off this thing ?
HENRY: Where 's Marcus ? !
INDY: Dad !
SALLAH: Father of Indy—give me you hand !
INDY: Sallah ! Get Dadl SALLAH reaches out to HENRY .
SALLAH: Give me your hand !
HENRY: Junior ? ! We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING .
SALLAH: Indy ? !
HENRY: Oh , God . I 've lost him . And I never told him anything . I just was n't ready , Marcus . Five minutes would have been enough .
INDY: I thought you had too , sir .
HENRY: Well—well done ! Come on !
DONOVAN: The Canyon of the Crescent Moon . Now ELSA peers through the binoculars .
DONOVAN: Helmut , another volunteer !
ELSA: I never expected to see you again .
INDY: I 'm like a bad penny . I always turn up .
DONOVAN: Step back now , Doctor Schneider . Give Doctor Jones some room . He 's going to recover the Grail for us .
INDY: As what ? A Nazi stooge like you ?
DONOVAN: Nazis ? ! —Is that the limit of your vision ? ! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world . Well , they 're welcome . But I want the Grail itself . The cup that gives everlasting life . Hitler can have the world , but he ca n't take it with him . I 'm going to be drinking my own health when he 's gone the way of the Dodo . The Grail is mine , and you 're going to get it for me .
INDY: Shooting me wo n't get you anywhere .
DONOVAN: You know something , Doctor Jones ? you 're absolutely right .
INDY: Dad ? !
HENRY: Junior . . .
ELSA: No ! !
DONOVAN: Get back !
INDY: `` The Breath of God Only the penitent man will pass . Only the penitent man will pass . . . `` INDY takes a few steps forward .
HENRY: `` Only the penitent man will pass . Only the penitent man will pass . ''
INDY: The penitent man will pass . The penitent the penitent . The penitent man
HENRY: The penitent man . The penitent
INDY: The penitent man is humble before God .
HENRY: Penitent . Penitent
INDY: The penitent man is humble The cobwebs begin to move .
DONOVAN: We 're through ! BRODY and SALLAH smile , relieved .
SALLAH: He 's all right . HENRY shakes his head .
HENRY: No .
INDY: `` The second challenge is the Word of God . Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed . '' The Word of God The Word of
BRODY: No , Henry . Try not to talk .
HENRY: The Name of God
INDY: The Name of God Jehovahl
INDY: `` J . ''
INDY: In Latin , `` Jehovah '' starts with an `` I . '' `` I ''
INDY: It 's a leap of faith . Oh , God .
KNIGHT: I knew you 'd come , but my strength has left me .
INDY: Who are you ?
KNIGHT: The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it .
INDY: That was seven hundred years ago .
KNIGHT: A long time to wait .
INDY: I 'm not exactlya knight . What do you mean ?
KNIGHT: I was chosen because I was the avest and the most worthy . The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat . I pass it to you who vanquished me . The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY .
INDY: Listen , I do n't have time to explain , but—
DONOVAN: Which one is it ?
KNIGHT: You must choose . But choose wisely . For as the True Grail will bring you life— the False Grail will take it from you .
DONOVAN: I 'm not a historian . I have no idea what it looks like . Which one is it ?
ELSA: Let me choose .
DONOVAN: Thank you , Doctor .
KNIGHT: He chosepoorly . INDY studies the array of chalices .
ELSA: It would not be made out of gold .
INDY: That 's the cup of a carpenter . He and ELSA exchange a look .
KNIGHT: You have chosen wisely . But the Grail can not pass beyond the Great Seal . That is the boundary and the price of immortality .
SALLAH: Drop your guns . Please .
INDY: Dad , come on . Get to your feet .
INDY: Elsa ! Elsa , do n't movel
ELSA: It 's ours , Indy . Yours and mine .
INDY: Elsa , do n't cross the Seal . The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here .
HENRY: Junior ! Junior !
INDY: Elsa . Elsa do n't . Elsa . Elsa . Give me your other hand , honey . I ca n't hold you .
ELSA: I can reach it . I can reach it Her hand begins to slip from Indy 's grasp .
INDY: Elsa ! Give me your hand . Give me your other hand !
HENRY: Junior , give me your other hand ! I ca n't hold on ! !
INDY: I can get it—I can almost each it , Dad .
HENRY: Indiana . Indiana ! !
INDY: Dad . . . The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY .
HENRY: Elsa never really believed in the Grail . She thought she 'd found a prize .
INDY: What did vou find , Dad ?
HENRY: Me ? Illumination .
INDY: Junior ? ! Dad
SALLAH: PleaseWhat does it always mean , thisthis `` Junior ? ''
HENRY: That 's his name . Henry Jones , Junior .
INDY: I like Indiana .
HENRY: We named the dog Indiana .
BRODY: May we go home now , please ?
SALLAH: The dog ! ? You are named after the dog
INDY: I 've got a lot of fond memories of that dog .
HENRY: Ready .
BRODY: Indy ! Henryl Follow met I know the way ! Haaa !
HENRY: Got lost in his own museum , huh ?
INDY: Uh-huh .
HENRY: After you , Junior .
INDY: Yes , sir ! Haaa !
BARRANCA: They 're talking about the Curse again !
INDY: No .
BARRANCA: I do not carry supplies .
INDY: We 'll leave them . Once we 've got it , we 'll be able to reach the plane by dusk .
SATIPO: The Hovitos are near . The poison is still fresh three days . They 're following us , I tell you .
INDY: If they knew we were here , they would have killed us already .
SATIPO: A friend of yours ?
INDY: Competitor . He was good , very good .
BARRANCA: No one has ever come out of there alive . Why should we put our faith in you ?
INDY: No one ever had what we have partners .
SATIPO: I knew nothing ! He was crazy ! Please !
INDY: Let 's go .
SATIPO: What 's wrong ? Are you lost ?
INDY: Forrestal .
SATIPO: We can go no further .
INDY: Now , Satipo , we do n't want to be discouraged by every little thing .
INDY: Let me see that .
SATIPO: Señor , I think we are very close . Indy stands still looking at the hall .
INDY: That 's what scares me .
SATIPO: There 's plenty of light , amigo .
INDY: You wait here .
SATIPO: If you insist , señor .
INDY: Adios .
BELLOQ: Dr. Jones , you choose the wrong friends . This time it will cost you .
INDY: Too bad they do n't know you like I do , Belloq .
BELLOQ: Yes , too bad . You could warn them if only you spoke Hovitos .
INDY: Get it going ! Get it going !
JOCK: Do n't mind him . That 's Reggie . Would n't hurt a soul .
INDY: I ca n't stand snakes .
JOCK: The world 's full of them , you know .
INDY: I hate them .
JOCK: Come on now , Sport , show a little of the old backbone .
BRODY: Do you think the idol will ever show up ?
INDY: I do n't know . Just because Belloq had it does n't mean he kept it .
TEACHING ASSISTANT: I could n't get the McNabe , Professor . Someone 's got it checked out 'til next month when classes start .
INDY: That 's all right , Phil . Thanks a lot .
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Will there be anything else ?
INDY: No . I 'll see you Thursday .
BRODY: No , they 're beautiful . The Museum will buy them as usual . No questions asked .
INDY: Then what 's wrong ?
BRODY: I brought along some people today .
INDY: What kind of people ?
BRODY: Government .
INDY: Government ?
BRODY: Do n't worry , it 's not about you usiness . They 're from the Army .
INDY: I 've already served .
BRODY: Army Intelligence . They 're looking for Abner .
MUSGROVE: But you did study under Professo Ravenwood at the University of Chicago ?
INDY: We have n't spoken in ten years . I 'm afraid we had a bit of a falling out .
EATON: You know nothing of his whereabouts ?
INDY: Just rumors . Somewhere in Asia , last I heard .
EATON: Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of it .
MUSGROVE: Well you must understand , Dr. Jones , this is all strictly confidential .
INDY: I understand .
MUSGROVE: Yesterday , one of our European sections intercepted a Nazi communiqué from Cairo to Berlin . We do n't quite know what to make of it . Musgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase .
BRODY: Tanis . They must have discovered the lost ruins .
INDY: Tanis . Ai n't that somethin ' !
EATON: Frankly , we 're a little suspicious An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable .
INDY: Ah , Ravenwood 's no Nazi .
EATON: Then what do they want him for ?
INDY: They 're looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra .
MUSGROVE: But it says here that 's in China .
INDY: Only half of it . Ravenwood had the other half .
EATON: What would the Nazis want with this - this Staff of Ra ?
BRODY: I can tell you that . Over the last two years the Nazis have had teams of archeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of eligious artifacts .
MUSGROVE: That 's right . Hitler 's a nut on the subject . Crazy . He 's obsessed with the occult .
EATON: What is this Staff of Ra , anyway ?
INDY: It all has to do with the Ark of the Covenant . The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments . Now it 's the Army men who are impressed .
MUSGROVE: where the Ark of the Covenant was kept .
INDY: Which is probably what the Nazis are after .
EATON: What 's this Ark look like ?
INDY: Look like ? Why , it 's right here
EATON: Good God !
INDY: Yes . That 's what the Hebrews thought .
MUSGROVE: What 's that supposed to be coming out of there ?
INDY: Who knows lightning fire the power of God .
EATON: I 'm beginning to understand Hitler 's interest in this thing .
INDY: Oh yes . The Bible tells of it leveling mountains and wasting entire regions . Moses promised that when the Ark was with you , `` your enemies will be scattered and your foes fell before you '' . An army which carries the Ark before it is invincible . Eaton and Musgrove exchange worried looks .
MUSGROVE: Dr. Jones , you 've been very helpful . I hope we can call on you again if we have questions .
INDY: Most certainly .
BRODY: I 've got to talk to you .
INDY: This is n't really a good time .
BRODY: Indy , it 's important .
INDY: All right . Come on in .
BRODY: They want you to go for it . And they 'll pay .
INDY: Good work , Marcus . I had a feeling this would happen . And , of course , the Museum gets the Ark when we 're done .
BRODY: Of course . Indy 's manner is vigorous , aggressive .
INDY: Okay , here 's the way it 's gon na be . First , I 'll high-tail it to Shanghai and get the piece from General Hok . Then I think I know where I can find Ravenwood . If only I can get -
BRODY: General Hok 's a tough customer . They do n't call him the Wild Boar fo nothing . And he 's tied in with the Japanese .
INDY: I 'll worry about that when the time comes . My only hope is to find the Well of the Souls before the Nazis do .
KEHOE: Buzz Kehoe , Army Intelligence . You 've met Bang Chow .
INDY: What 's the hurry ?
KEHOE: Some German agents got here two hours ago . Luckily , Bang was able to have them detained at Customs . We 'll have to hurry .
INDY: Great . Got it .
KEHOE: What now ?
INDY: I 've got to get to Nepal .
SHERPA: Gmoiska ! Shurga rintoik !
CLIMBER: Aye ! That 'll be your last word .
MARION: That does it ! I 've been patient with you no-goods long enough . I 'm not open at 2 o'clock for myself , you know . It 's all for you . And how do you repay me Trouble and noise and lood on my floor ! I wo n't have it . Everybody out ! Out ! Out ! We 're closed . Closed ! Do your killing outside ! And do n't leave any bodies on the porch !
INDY: Hello , Marion .
MARION: Get up and get out .
INDY: Take it easy . I 'm looking for you father .
MARION: Well you 're two years too late .
INDY: What happened ?
MARION: Avalanche . Up there . He was digging . What else ? He spent his whole life digging . Dragging me all over this otten earth . For what ?
INDY: Do you find him ?
MARION: Hell no . He 's buried where he was working . Probably preserved real good , too . In the snow .
INDY: Not a bad way to go . Doing what he loved .
MARION: Do n't give me that stuff ! What do you know ? I 'm the one that was left in a bad way . He did n't have a penny . Guess how I lived , Mister Jones . I worked here . And I was n't the bartender . Finally the guy that owned the joint went crazy . Snow crazy . They took his away screaming . As they dragged him out , he said the place was all mine for life . She looks around the saloon .
INDY: Why not leave ? Go back to the States .
MARION: I 'll go back . I 'll get there . Not that there 's a soul there who knows my name or cares . But I 'll go . And when I do , they 'll know me . 'Cause I 'm going to go back in style . With money . A goddamn lady !
INDY: Where you gon na get it ?
MARION: If I knew that , you think I 'd still e running this dive ?
INDY: I need one of the pieces your fathe collected .
MARION: You son-of-a-bitch ! You know what you did to me , to my life ? This is your handiwork .
INDY: I never meant to hurt you .
MARION: I was a child !
INDY: You knew what you were doing .
MARION: I was in love .
INDY: I guess that depends on you definition .
MARION: It was wrong . You knew it . Indy releases her arms .
INDY: Look , I did what I did . I do n't expect you to be happy about it . But maybe we can do each other some good .
MARION: Why start now ?
INDY: Shut up and listen for a second . I want that piece your father had . I 've got money . This stops her .
MARION: How much ?
INDY: Enough to get you back to the States . Where are his things ?
MARION: Gone . I sold it all . It was all junk . The junk he wasted his life on .
INDY: Everything ? Marion nods .
MARION: You look disappointed . I like that . How 's it feel ? Indy has to smile at her glee .
INDY: Seltzer .
MARION: Real man 's drink . Me , I like scotch . And I like bourbon . And vodka and gin . I 'm not much for brandy . I 'm off that .
INDY: You 're a tough broad now , are n't you ?
MARION: It 's no act , pal . This ai n't Schenectady .
INDY: I can only say I 'm sorry so many times .
MARION: You really have money ? You do n't look rich . I may be able to locate some of his things . I know who 's got them . What do you want ?
INDY: A bronze piece , about this size . In the shape of the sun . Probably broken off at the bottom . Has a little hole in it , off-center . Does that sound familiar ? Marion thinks , nods slowly .
MARION: Maybe . How much ?
INDY: Three thousand . American .
MARION: That 'll get me back , but not in style . This doodad must be pretty important .
INDY: Maybe . A huge smile lights up Marion 's face .
MARION: I knew it would happen eventually . I knew it . Something had to go my way . I 've got to think this out . I 'm used to bargaining with yaks .
INDY: Okay , five thousand . That 's all I can give you now . I can get you more when you land in the States .
MARION: You word , huh ? Just like you said you 'd be back last time ? That was your word too .
INDY: I 'm back , are n't I ? Marion sneers and they smile together .
MARION: Come back tomorrow .
INDY: Why ?
MARION: Because I said so , that 's why . It 's about time I called the shots in this relationship . Indy nods , gets up to go .
INDY: I trust you .
MARION: You 're an idiot .
INDY: I 've heard that .
MARION: Hold it . Come here .
INDY: Bossy , are n't you ?
MARION: That 's right . Give me a kiss .
INDY: Tomorrow .
BELZIG: Good evening , Fraulein .
MARION: The bar 's closed .
BELZIG: We are not thirsty .
MARION: What do you want ?
BELZIG: The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted . Surely he told you there would be other interested parties . Marion shakes her head .
MARION: Why , are you willing to offer more ?
BELZIG: Almost certainly . Do you still have it ?
MARION: No . But I know where it is .
BELZIG: We will stick to the business at hand , Fraulein .
MARION: Fine . Why do n't you come back tomorrow when Jones is here and we 'll have an auction ?
BELZIG: I 'm afraid an auction is not possible . Your fire is dying here , Fraulein . Why do n't you tell us where the piece is right now ?
MARION: Listen , Herr Mac , I do n't know who you 're used to dealing with , but no one tells me what to do in my place .
BELZIG: Americans ! You 're all alike . Fraulein Ravenwood . I 'll show you want I 'm used to .
MARION: Wait ! I can be reasonable -
BELZIG: That time is passed .
MARION: You do n't need that . I 'll tell you everything !
BELZIG: Yes , I know you will .
INDY: Hello . Now everything begins to happen very fast -
BELZIG: Shoot them both !
SECOND NAZI: He 's our man !
BELZIG: Do as I say !
MARION: Unbelievable !
INDY: Let 's get out of here !
MARION: Not without that piece you want !
INDY: It 's here ?
MARION: There !
INDY: Let 's go !
MARION: You burned down my place !
INDY: I owe you plenty !
MARION: You owe me plenty !
INDY: You 're something !
MARION: I am something . And I 'll tell you exactly what - She holds up the medallion possessively .
FAYAH: Silence ! Why do you forget yourselves ?
MARION: Why , thank you . I like you too .
FAYAH: Then it shall be welcome in our house .
MARION: Oh , no ! You do n't have to have it around if you do n't want it -
SALLAH: All of Allah 's creatures are welcome here . You please us by letting us please you .
INDY: I knew the Germans would hire you , Sallah . They could n't have an excavation in the desert without the est digger in Egypt .
SALLAH: All Arabs look alike to them , Indy .
INDY: Tell me about the map room at Tanis .
SALLAH: We found it three days ago . I broke through myself .
INDY: Those Nazis are moving awfully fast .
SALLAH: The Frenchman is helping them . Indy reacts .
INDY: Belloq . So he got away from the Indians . This is going to be more interesting that I thought .
SALLAH: I 'm afraid this has put the Germans close to finding the Well of the Souls .
INDY: Even Belloq wo n't be able to find it without that . Can you make anything of those markings ? They 're nothing I 'm familiar with .
SALLAH: But I know someone who might . You can go to see him tomorrow . Indy something bothers me .
INDY: What is it , my friend ?
SALLAH: It is the Ark . If it is there , at Tanis It is not something man was meant to disturb Death has always surrounded it . It is not of this earth .
INDY: Do you really need that monkey ?
MARION: I 'm surprised at you , Indy . Talking that way about our baby . He 's got your looks , too .
INDY: And your brains .
MARION: Hey ! Hey ! where 're you going ?
INDY: He 'll be OK. Come on . Come on .
MARION: Indy-y-y-y !
INDY: Marion .
ARAB BARTENDER: The gentleman in the corner sent it . He would like you to join him .
INDY: Too bad . I 'm drinking alone .
BELLOQ: Good evening , Dr. Jones .
INDY: I ought to kill you right now .
BELLOQ: It was not I who brought the girl into this dirty business .
INDY: Not a very private place for a murder .
BELLOQ: These Arabs will not interfere in the white man 's business . They do not care if we kill each other off . Terribly difficult finding a decent vintage here . You were quite vigorous in Shanghai . Unfortunately , our friend the Wild Boar had taken the precaution of making several copies of the piece .
INDY: Try the local sewer .
BELLOQ: I know you despise me . We always hate in others that which we most fear in ourselves . And you and I are very much alike .
INDY: Now you 're getting nasty .
BELLOQ: We have always done the same kind of work . Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend . I am a shadowy eflection of you . But it would have taken only a nudge to make you the same as me , to push you out of the light .
INDY: What about your boss , der Fuhrer ? I thought he was waiting to take possession .
BELLOQ: When the time is right . When I am finished with it .
INDY: I hope your friends are patient . Dangerous work , Belloq .
BELLOQ: Yes . Very . You may consider yourself fortunate that your involvement concludes here .
INDY: Tell me , did you get away with the idol ?
BELLOQ: I was lucky to get away with my life . The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded about the whole matter . Indy takes a drink .
INDY: You know , if it 's God you want to talk to , maybe I can arrange it .
BELLOQ: You have not changed . But , please , do not reach for your weapon until you are ready to die .
LITTLE SON: Uncle Indy , we have been looking fo you .
LITTLE DAUGHTER: Come home now , Uncle . Hurry !
INDY: Yes . Yes , I 'll come now .
BELLOQ: Next time , Indiana Jones , it will take more than children to save you . The children usher Indy out .
SALLAH: I thought we would find you there . Better than the United States Marines , eh ?
INDY: Thanks you . Marion 's dead .
SALLAH: Yes , I know . I am sorry . More reason than ever to beat the astards . Life goes on , Indy . There is the proof . Indy looks back there , nods .
INDY: And they made the calculation in the map room ?
SALLAH: This morning . Belloq and the boss German , Shliemann . When they came out of the map room , we were given a new spot in which to dig out away from the camp .
INDY: The Well of the Souls .
AMIR: Come . Look .
INDY: Just want I need .
AMIR: Yes it is here .
SALLAH: About seventy-five inches .
AMIR: Wait ! I am not finished
INDY: You said their top section was blank . Are you absolutely sure ? Sallah nods .
SALLAH: A home run , my friend , grand slam ! We have a saying - `` A little luck is etter than much smartness . '' Indy , pardner , you are very lucky fellow .
INDY: My God ! They are n't kidding !
SALLAH: There ! That is the map room !
INDY: What time does the sun hit the map ?
SALLAH: Just after eight .
INDY: We have n't got much time . Where are the Germans digging for the Well of the Souls ?
JEEP GERMAN: Yes , you . What are you doing there ? Sallah gestures his innocence .
HUNGRY GERMAN: Now , idiot !
INDY: Sallah . Sallah !
HUNGRY GERMAN: Why are n't you at the digs ? Come here !
INDY: I though you were dead .
MARION: They were throwing me around like a ag doll .
INDY: They must have switched baskets . Thank god for that ! Bless those astards . Have they hurt you ?
MARION: No . Not since I got here . They just asked about you - what you knew . The Frenchman 's got the hot 's for me . I 've been playing that along . Oh , Indy , get me out of here .
INDY: I have to leave you here for a little while . I know where the Ark is . If I take you out of here they 'll start combing the place for us .
MARION: Cut me loose !
INDY: Keep your voice down .
MARION: I said get me out of -
INDY: Look , you do n't know how glad I am to see you . And I do n't like doing this . But the whole thing will be shot if you do n't just sit here quietly . They have n't hurt you in the last twenty-four hours , they are n't going to start now . I 'll be ack to get you in no time .
BELLOQ: I cautioned you about being premature with that communiqué to Berlin . Archeology is not an exact science . If does not adhere to time schedules .
SHLIEMANN: The Fuhrer is not a patient man . He demands constant reports and he expects progress . You led me to elieve -
BELLOQ: Nothing . I have made no promises . I said only that it looked very favorable . Perhaps the Ark will still e found in an adjoining chamber . Based on the information in ou possession , my calculations were correct . Perhaps some bit of evidence still eludes us . Perhaps
GOBLER: Perhaps the girl can help us . Belloq shoots him an angry look .
SHLIEMANN: My feeling exactly . She was in possession of the original piece fo years . She may know much . If properly motivated
BELLOQ: I tell you , she knows nothing useful .
SHLIEMANN: I 'm surprised to find you squeamish . That is not your reputation . But it need n't concern you . I have the perfect man for this kind of work .
INDY: The Ark must be in that stone case . What 's that gray stuff all over the floor -
SALLAH: Asps . Very dangerous .
INDY: Lots of torches . And oil . I want a landing strip down there .
BELLOQ: Believe me , you made a mistake . If you would just give me something to placate them . Some bit of information .
MARION: I swear to you , I know nothing more . I have no loyalty to Jones . He 's ought me only trouble . He wants to believe her .
BELLOQ: I can not control them .
BELZIG: We meet again , Fraulein .
INDY: Do n't touch it ! Never touch it !
BELLOQ: Why , Dr. Jones , whatever are you doing in such a nasty place ? Belloq and the Germans laugh .
INDY: Why do n't you fellows come down here ? I 'll show you .
BELLOQ: No thank you , my friend . I think we are all very comfortable up here .
SHLIEMANN: I 'm afraid we must be going now , Dr. Jones . Our prize is awaited in Berlin . But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone .
MARION: Do n't put me down ! Up at the hole , there 's plenty of dissension .
BELLOQ: The girl was mine !
SHLIEMANN: She is of no use to us . Only ou mission for the Fuhrer matters .
BELLOQ: Goodbye , mademoiselle . Indiana Jones adieu !
INDY: Do n't panic . There 's plenty of time for that later . Wave that at anything that slithers .
MARION: What are you doing ?
INDY: Just watch the floor .
MARION: Whatever you 're doing , do it faster .
INDY: There !
MARION: Where are you going ?
INDY: I 'll be back in a minute . We 're going through this wall .
MARION: What do you mean ?
INDY: Come on !
MARION: The snakes are they here ?
INDY: I guess not . I think I 'd be dead .
MARION: Do you know where you 're going ?
INDY: Absolutely .
MARION: Thank god . Where ?
INDY: Out .
GOBLER: Get is gassed immediately ! It has an important cargo to take out !
INDY: When the Ark gets loaded , we 're already going to be on that plane .
SHLIEMANN: Stay with the Ark !
BELLOQ: We must get the Ark away from this place immediately !
SHLIEMANN: Have it put on the truck . We 'll fly out of Cairo . Gobler snaps his heels , turns to go .
SALLAH: Holy smoke , my friends ! I am so pleased you are not dead .
MARION: Us too .
SALLAH: The Ark ! They 're taking it on a truck to Cairo .
INDY: Where is it ?
MARION: What about you ?
INDY: I 'm going to get that truck . I 'll meet you at Omar 's . Be ready for me .
MARION: How are you going to get that truck ?
INDY: I do n't know . I 'm making this up as I go . He runs away between two tents .
SHLIEMANN: If anything happens to that Ark , we 're all dead men ! The Fuhrer will see to it !
MARION: I have a feeling I 'm not the first woman to travel with these pirates . There 's a whole wardrobe in there .
INDY: It 's lovely .
MARION: I feel like a virgin bride in this .
INDY: That 's what you look like .
MARION: There are some things you can ecapture in this life , but that is n't one of them .
INDY: What would you like to recapture ?
MARION: Nothing . That is the way it is .
INDY: Did I ever say I was sorry I burned down your tavern ? She turns so their lips are very close .
MARION: No . Then again , I burned up that plane .
INDY: You saved my life .
MARION: And you saved mine .
INDY: Seems things have worked out kind of even .
MARION: That 's the way I like them .
INDY: Maybe we should consider all past accounts closed . Marion thinks about this a long time .
MARION: No . Not yet .
INDY: What else ?
MARION: What is it ?
INDY: The engines have shut down .
MARION: Why ?
INDY: I 'm going to find out .
MESSENGER PIRATE: Mister Jones ! The Captain he say -
INDY: What 's wrong ?
KATANGA: You have most important friends .
INDY: Holy shit .
KATANGA: I sent my man for you . You and the girl must disappear . We have a place in the hold . Go , my friend !
SHLIEMANN: Take it aboard the Wurrfler !
BELLOQ: And be very careful ! The Ark is taken away .
SHLIEMANN: What about Jones ?
SERGEANT: Not a trace yet , sir !
KATANGA: Jones is dead . Belloq and Shliemann regard him suspiciously .
SHLIEMANN: Savage . You are not in a position to ask for anything . We will take what we wish and then decide whether o not to blow your ship from the water .
BELLOQ: That girl goes with me . It will be part of my compensation . I 'm sure the Fuhrer would approve . Shliemann considers .
SHLIEMANN: What do you think , Captain ?
INDY: Damn !
TALL CAPTAIN: The tents have been arranged in accordance with your radioed instructions , sir .
BELLOQ: Good . We must take the Ark there now .
SHLIEMANN: I am uncomfortable with the thought of this - Jewish ritual . Are you sure it 's necessary ?
BELLOQ: Let me ask you this - Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding out only then if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside ? Knowing , only then , whether you have accomplished your mission and obtained the one , true Ark ?
INDY: Hold it . One move from anybody and I blow that box back to Moses .
BELLOQ: Jones , your persistence surprises even me . You are going to give mercenaries a bad name .
INDY: What about you ? Talked to God yet ? Where 's the girl ?
SHLIEMANN: Doctor Jones , surely you do n't think you can escape from this base .
INDY: That depends on how reasonable we 're all willing to be . All I want is the girl . We 'll keep possession of the Ark only till we 've got safe transport to England . Then it 's all yours .
SHLIEMANN: If we refuse ?
INDY: Then the Ark and some of us are going up in a big bang . I do n't think Hitle would like that a bit . Now I do n't want to talk about this anymore . Show me that girl in five seconds or -
SHLIEMANN: Jones , this is the second time I have seen you looking very foolish .
INDY: It 's a bad habit . I 'm trying to break it . Shliemann draws his Luger .
SHLIEMANN: I 'll help you . This time I 'll kill you myself . Shliemann raises the pistol .
BELLOQ: No ! Not in the presence of the Ark ! Take him outside .
INDY: Thanks . If you talk to Him , tell Him I 'm on my way up .
MARION: Oh , Indy ! Thank god you 're here .
INDY: Glad I could make it .
MARION: What about the Ark ?
INDY: Are you game ?
MARION: Hell yes ! We 've made it this far .
INDY: Okay . Let 's do it .
SHLIEMANN: Stop them ! Kill them !
INDY: Get down !
OFFICER: We must cover the drums ! Protect them from the bullets !
MARION: Slow it down !
MUSGROVE: You 've done your country a great service .
EATON: And we trust you found the settlement satisfactory ?
MARION: Quite .
EATON: Good , good . Then I guess that about does it .
BRODY: When can we have the Ark ?
EATON: I thought we answered that . It 's someplace very safe -
INDY: That 's a powerful force . Research should be done -
EATON: Oh , it will be , Dr. Jones , I assure you . We have top men working on it ight now .
INDY: Who ?
EATON: Top men . Indy exchanges a look with Brody .
INDY: We may be able to help .
EATON: We appreciate that . And we wo n't hesitate to call on you .
MUSGROVE: Thank you all . Thank you again .
MARION: Well they are n't going to tell you , so why do n't you just forget it . I 'd think you 'd had enough of that damn Ark . Just put your mind on something else .
INDY: Yeah , like what ?

WILLIE: No I 'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead . Oh noI ripped my dress . Where are we anyway ?
INDIANA: India
WILLIE: Holy cow India ? How do you know we 're in
INDIANA: He told me they knew I was coming here .
WILLIE: What do you mean how ?
INDIANA: The old man saw it in a dream .
WILLIE: Dream nightmare is more like it .
INDIANA: He said that 's whey they were at iver they were waiting fo the plane to fall down .
WILLIE: I hope this means we 're going to get some dinner .
INDIANA: That 's more food than these people eat in a week . They 're starving , too
WILLIE: I 'm sorry , I here , please .
CHIEFTAIN: You will rest here before you go on .
INDIANA: We 'd appreciate that . This was an unexpected detour . We 'll have to go to Delhi now and find a flight west .
SHORT ROUND: Indy is taking me to America .
INDIANA: I 'm a professor . I have to re- turn to the university . Can you give us a guide to take us to Delhi ?
CHIEFTAIN: Sanju will guide you .
INDIANA: Thank you . The old shaman speaks now for the first time .
SHAMAN: On the way to Delhi , you will stop at Pankot .
INDIANA: Pankot is n't on the way to Delhi .
SHAMAN: You will go to palace there .
INDIANA: Has n't the Pankot palace been de- serted since the Mutiny of 1857 ?
SHAMAN: No . Now there is new Maharajah and palace is powerful again .
INDIANA: I do n't understand . What 's hap- pened here ?
SHAMAN: The evil starts in Pankot . Then like monsoon , it moves darkness over all country .
INDIANA: What evil ?
SHAMAN: They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village . Willie looks over at Indiana
WILLIE: Took what ?
INDIANA: It 's a sacred stone in a shine that 's supposed to protect a village .
SHAMAN: It is why Krishna brought you here .
INDIANA: Nobody brought us here . Our plane crashed . We were shot down by
SHAMAN: No . We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone . It was Krishna who made you fall from sky so you can got to Pankot Palace . To find siva- linga and bring back to us .
SHORT ROUND: Indy , they make out plane crash ? To get you here ?
INDIANA: It 's just superstition , Shorty . Like a ghost story .
CHIEFTAIN: Yes .
INDIANA: Was the stone very smooth ? It was probably brought here from a sacred river .
SHAMAN: Long ago before my father 's father .
INDIANA: And it had three lines painted across it ? The lines represent the three levels of the universe . I 've seen stones like the one you lost .
WILLIE: I do n't understand how losing one ock could destroy this village . Is it really powerful ?
INDIANA: But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone ?
SHAMAN: They say we must pray to thei evil god . We say we will not .
INDIANA: He says that when the sacred stone was taken the village wells dried up first and then the river stopped .
WILLIE: Their children ?
INDIANA: He says one night there was a fire in the fields . The men went to fight it . When they came back , they heard the women crying in the darkness . And the children were gone . The shaman walks slowly toward Indiana .
SHAMAN: You will find them when you find sivlalinga .
INDIANA: I 'm sorry , I do n't know how I can help you here .
CHIEFTAIN: They do not listen .
INDIANA: I have friends in Delhi and I will make sure they investigate this

SHORT ROUND: I ride with you , Indy ?
INDIANA: Nope , you got a little surprise over there , Shorty .
SHORT ROUND: Oh boy !

SHORT ROUND: They do n't cry about you . They cry about the elephants leaving .
WILLIE: Figures
SHORT ROUND: They got no food to feed them . So they taking the elephants away to sell them . Indy lumbers over on his elephant .
INDIANA: All right , let 's go . I want to get to Pankot before tomorrow night . She looks at Indiana as he rides past .
WILLIE: Pankot ? ! I thought we were going to Delhi ! Hey , wait a minute ! Ca n't somebody take me to Delhi ? ! I do n't want to go to Pankot !
SHORT ROUND: Here you go , lunch time !
WILLIE: Those are very big bird . Sajnu says something and Indiana nods .
INDIANA: Those are n't birds those are giant bats . Willie shudders as she watches the bats .
WILLIE: They must be pretty dumb to drink that awful-looking water .
INDIANA: I think maybe we 'll camp here .
WILLIE: Stark naked ? You wish If you 're trying to seduce me , Dr. Jones , this is a very primitive approach .
INDIANA: Me seduce you ? Honey , you 're the one who took your clothes off . I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water .
WILLIE: Somehow I feel safer in here .
INDIANA: Do n't worry , I 'm coming in ! What is it ?

INDIANA: See I got you out
WILLIE: Thanks for nothing ! I hate snakes !
INDIANA: I know the feeling
SHORT ROUND: You come to America with me , and we can get job in the circus you like that ? The baby elephant trumpets affirmitively .
WILLIE: Where 'd you find your little body- guard ?
INDIANA: I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket . Indiana kneels and arranges the wood . INDIANA Shorty 's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai . He was living on the streets .
WILLIE: He 'll be okay . He 's a good kid . Indy strikes a match and lights the new fire . WILLIE All these fires you expecting more snakes , Dr. Jones ?
INDIANA: By the way , how 'd you end up in Shanghai ?
WILLIE: Well , when my nightclub career was un over by the Depression , some pinhead convinced me that `` a girl could go places in the Orient '' So , look where I got .
INDIANA: What about the future ?
WILLIE: Oh , that 's easy I 'm going to latch onto a good-looking , in- credibly rich prince . Indy lies down on the blanket .
INDIANA: I 'd like to find one of those myself .
WILLIE: Oh really ?
INDIANA: Yeah , but he 's got to be dead and uried for a couple of thousand years . Fortune and glory
WILLIE: Is that what you 're hoping to find at this palace , Dr. Jones ?
INDIANA: Maybe
WILLIE: What 's that ?
INDIANA: Something that kid gave me last night . It 's a piece of an old manuscript .
WILLIE: What does the writing say ?
INDIANA: It 's Sanskrit . It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt . Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva .
WILLIE: That 's Shiva ? What 's he giving the Priest ?
INDIANA: Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil . To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers .
WILLIE: You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village ? Indy looks at her meaningfully .
INDIANA: It could be .
WILLIE: Fortune and glorysweet dreams , Dr. Jones . She picks up a blanket and starts off .
INDIANA: I think you should sleep closer . I meant for safety .
WILLIE: I 'd be safer sleeping with that snake .
INDIANA: Could n't keep away , huh ?
WILLIE: Just try and control yourself .
INDIANA: Still scared ? Okay , Willie , you can get closer if you want
SHORT ROUND: Indy , look !
INDIANA: That 's it . Pankot Palace .
SHORT ROUND: What you look at , Indy ?
INDIANA: Just a statue .
WILLIE: What 's the guide talking about ? He has n't said a word the whole trip .
INDIANA: He said he could n't take us any farther . He has to go sell the elephants .
WILLIE: You mean we have to walk the rest of the way ?
INDIANA: Any more complaints ?
WILLIE: Yeah , I wish you 'd thought of this sooner
INDIANA: It does n't feel like there 's been any permanent damage .
WILLIE: Hi
CHATTAR LAL: I would say you look rather lost . But then I can not imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home
INDIANA: Lost ? No , we 're not lost . We 're on our way to Delhi . This is Miss Scott and Mr . Round . My name 's Indiana Jones .
CHATTAR LAL: Dr. Jones ? The eminent archae- ologist ?
WILLIE: Hard to believe , is n't it ?
CHATTAR LAL: I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford . I Am Chattar Lal , Prime Minister fo His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot . He bows and Willie sort of curtsies . CHATTAR LAL Welcome to Pankot Palace .
WILLIE: How 'd you like to run into him in a dark alleythat one 's kind of cuteI could see myself married to a prince like that
CHATTAR LAL: The plane crash and your journey here sound most incredible .
WILLIE: You should have been there
INDIANA: We 'd appreciate it if the Mahara- jah would let us stay tonight . We 'll be on out way in the morn- ing .
CHATTAR LAL: I am only his humble servant , but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice .
WILLIE: Is that him ?
CHATTAR LAL: No , no , that is Uhmed Singh , the present Maharajah 's late father .
WILLIE: Oh good . And maybe the pres- ent Marahajah is a little younger ? And thinner ?
CHATTAR LAL: They will escort you to your rooms now . You will be provided with fresh clothes . Tonight you will e dining with His Highness .
WILLIE: Dinner ? And with a prince ? ! My luck is changing . But look at me my god , I 've to to get eady !
CHATTAR LAL: Eight o'clock in the Pleasure Pavilion .
INDIANA: You look like a princess .
WILLIE: It 's sort of like being in heaven .
INDIANA: I 've always had a weakness fo folk dancing .
WILLIE: She might get away with that act here , but she 'd never make it in a real nightclub .
CHATTAR LAL: We are fortunate tonight to have some many unexpected guests . his is Captain Phillip Blumburtt . Blumburtt bows to Willie and Indiana . CHATTAR LAL Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the `` natives '' .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Just a routine inspection tour .
CHATTAR LAL: The British worry so about thei Emprie it makes us feel like well-cared-for children .
WILLIE: Listen , Mr. Lal , what do you call the Maharajah 's wife ?
CHATTAR LAL: His Highness has not yet taken a wife .
WILLIE: No ? Well , I guess he just has n't met the right woman
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Interested in local curios ?
INDIANA: No . But I am interested in the occult . And this is a krtya .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Charming .
INDIANA: It 's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa . The kryta represents you enemy and gives you complete power over him .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: That God all that mumbo jumbo ubbish is disappearing .
INDIANA: You think so ?
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Of course . Admittedly , it 's taken time . Britian 's controlled India for almost two hundred eyars now .
INDIANA: You 're hanging on better here than you did in America .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: This is a different situation , Dr. Jones . These people are like children . We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century .
INDIANA: The Prime Minister does n't seem that naive .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: No , he 's a very shrewd old boy . Power behind the throne and all that . He actually runs this whole province .
WILLIE: I think this Maharajah is swim- ming in money . Maybe coming here was n't such a bad idea .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: I believe we 're being called to dinner .
WILLIE: Finally !
CHATTAR LAL: His Supremem Highness , guardian of Rajput tradition the Maharajah of Pankot Zalim Singh .
WILLIE: That 's the Maharajah that kid ? !
INDIANA: Maybe he likes older women .
WILLIE: I 've never been so hungry in my life
CHATTAR LAL: His Highness wants me to welcome his visitors . Especially the enowned Dr. Jones from America . Indy bows slightly toward the Maharajah .
INDIANA: We are honored to be here .
WILLIE: Suddenly I 'm not so hungry
INDIANA: I had a question , Mr. Prime Mini- ster . I was examining some of the Maharajah 's artifacts .
CHATTAR LAL: A very fine collection of very old pieces , do n't you think ?
INDIANA: Yes , very fine . But not all of the pieces look old . Some were carved ecently and look like images used y the Thuggees to worship the god- des Kali .
CHATTAR LAL: Dr. Jones , you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead fo nearly a century .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Of course . The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices . The Brit- ish Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857 .
MERCHANT: But you 're not eating !
WILLIE: I uh had bugs for lunch .
INDIANA: I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard .
CHATTAR LAL: There are no stories anymore .
INDIANA: Well , I do n't know we came here from a small village and the peas- ants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again becuase of some ancient evil . Indiana smiles and shrugs .
CHATTAR LAL: Their stories are just fear and folklore .
INDIANA: Maybe.. but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right elow the palace ?
CHATTAR LAL: The local peasants are just as superstitious . You 're very ob- servant , Dr. Jones . But you 're eginning to worry Capt . Blum- urtt .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: I 'm not worried , Prime Minister , just interested .
WILLIE: Give me your hat
SHORT ROUND: What for ?
WILLIE: I 'm going to puke in it
INDIANA: You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them .
CHATTAR LAL: Dr. Jones , it our country a guest does not usually insult his host .
INDIANA: Sorry , I thought we were just talking about folklore .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: I 'm sure it 's nothing . Just ru- mors . What was it they claimed was stolen ?
INDIANA: Something magical . A sacred rock .
CHATTAR LAL: There , you see , Captain . A rock !
INDIANA: When they lost this rock thei fields and animals dies . They also said their children were taken from them .
CHATTAR LAL: I think that 's enough of this nonsense , Dr. Jones
WILLIE: So you have something , you know , simple like soup or something ?
MERCHANT: Looks delicious !
WILLIE: I wan na go home
INDIANA: I was dubious muself at first . Then something connected the village 's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones
CHATTAR LAL: Dr. Jones , we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors . I seem to re- member that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robbe ather than a scientist .
INDIANA: The newspapers exaggerated the incident
CHATTAR LAL: And did n't the Sultan of Madagas- car threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his coun- try ?
INDIANA: That was a misunderstanding .
CHATTAR LAL: Exactly what we have here , Dr. Jones .
MAHARAJAH: I have heard the terrible stories of the evil Thuggee cult
INDIANA: I 'm sorry if I 've offended you . Now , more trays are whisked in by servants .
MERCHANT: Ah , dessert !
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Rather bizarre menu , wound n't you say ?
INDIANA: Even if they were trying to scare us away , a devout Hindu would never touch meat . Makes you wonder what these people are
MAHARAJAH: I have seen this thing . What is it , Dr. Jones ?
SHORT ROUND: Hey , nobody touches Indy 's whip !
INDIANA: We 're guests here , Shorty .
MAHARAJAH: You will show me how it works please .
INDIANA: You wish is my command , you Highness .
MAHARAJAH: That is wonderful ! Please teach me how !
INDIANA: Okay , Short Round , let go of it .
SHORT ROUND: That little Maharajah think he ig stuff .
INDIANA: You do n't like him do you ?
SHORT ROUND: Next time I flatten him ! Did you see his eyes ?
INDIANA: No .
SHORT ROUND: Indy , they glow like fire and get eal crazy ! Then he talk in this eal scary voice ! Indy tousles Short Round 's hair .
INDIANA: He was afraid of you . He knows a tough guy when he sees one .
SHORT ROUND: Yeah , that 's what happened
INDIANA: I better see how Willie is .
WILLIE: Not leftovers ?
INDIANA: No real food .
WILLIE: Oh , it is real foodit 's eautiful .

INDIANA: I 'm a scientist . I like doing esearch on certain `` nocturnal activities ''
WILLIE: You mean like love rituals
INDIANA: And mating customs They kiss again more heatedly .
WILLIE: Primitive sexual practices ?
INDIANA: You 're taling to an authority in that area . They kiss again hungrily
WILLIE: You 're dying to come into my room , are n't you ?
INDIANA: You want me so bad , why do n't you invite me ?
WILLIE: Too proud to admit you 're crazy about me , Dr. Jones ?
INDIANA: I think you 're too used to get- ting you own way , Willie
WILLIE: We 'll see who gives in first I 'll leave my door open .
INDIANA: Do n't catch cold .
WILLIE: Dr. Jones ?
INDIANA: You 're dreaming , Willie . You want to make it real , just knock on my door .
WILLIE: Five minutes , Dr. Jones
INDIANA: want me to be her palace slave !
SHORT ROUND: Get to sleep Indy I stay up and keep eye on things

INDIANA: Gee , I would n't want to touch an ugly critter like that !
SHORT ROUND: Uh uh me neither !
WILLIE: Oh no oh no ! !
INDIANA: You know , Willie , I 'll bet he 's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner .

SHORT ROUND: Willie , help us ! Hurry !
WILLIE: Get is off me get it off !
INDIANA: Not that one ! We had enought of that one , thank you
WILLIE: What is it ?
INDIANA: It 's a Thuggee ceremony . They 're whorshipping Kali , the goddess of Death and Destruction .
WILLIE: Oh my God ! He ripped out his he killed him !
INDIANA: Nothe heart 's still beating !
THE MULTITUDE: Jai ma Kali , jai ma Kali !
WILLIE: Let 's go ! Let 's get out of here !

NAINSUKH: I pray to Shiva let me die . But I do not . Now now the evil of Kali take me .
SHORT ROUND: How ?
NAINSUKH: They will make me drink blood of Kali . Then I fall into black sleep of Kali Ma
INDIANA: What is that ?
NAINSUKH: I become like them . I be alive nut like in nightmare . You drink the blood , you not wake up from nightmare of Kali Ma .
MOLA RAM: You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones .
INDIANA: Nobody 's perfect . The way I heard it , you stole one of them from a small village .
MOLA RAM: There were five stones in the eginning . Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars , sold off by thieves like you
INDIANA: Two are still missing .
MOLA RAM: No . They are here somewhere . A century ago when the British aided this temple and butchered my people , a loyal priest his the last two stones down here in the catacombs .
INDIANA: That 's what you 've got these chil- dren these slaves digging for ?
MOLA RAM: They dig for the gems to support our cause . They also search fo the last two stones . Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful !
INDIANA: Nobody can say you do n't have a vivid imagination .
MOLA RAM: You do not believe me ? You will , Dr. Jones . You will become a true eliever .
MAHARAJAH: You will not suffer . I recently ecame of age and tasted the blood of Kali .
MOLA RAM: Hold him !
MAHARAJAH: You will learn to obey because you are powerless !
MOLA RAM: The British in India will be slaughtered . Then we will over- un the Moslems and force thei `` Allah '' to bow to Kali .
WILLIE: Oh my God , you scared me ! Listen , you 've got to help . We found this tunnel
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Jones is n't in his room . Miss Scott my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi

CAPT. BLUMBURTT: What ?
WILLIE: We found a tennel that leads to a temple below the palace ! Please , come with me , I 'll show you !
CHATTAR LAL: Miss Scott , you 're not making any sense .
WILLIE: I 'm afraid they 'll kill them ! We saw horrible things down there they had a human sacrifice and they ipped a man 's heart out !
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Who ?
WILLIE: It 's some kind of cult ! And they 've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for .
CHATTAR LAL: I sense the fumes of opium in all this . Prehaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai .
WILLIE: What 're you talking about I 'm not a dope fiend ! I saw it ! I 'll show you !
INDIANA: What 're we playing , hid and seek ?
WILLIE: Oh , Indy , you got away ! Tell them what happened , they wo n't believe me

WILLIE: I want to go home
INDIANA: I do n't blame you this has n't een what you 'd call a fun vaca- tion
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Miss Scott panicked ?
INDIANA: When she saw the insects she passed out cold . I carried her back to her room . She was sleeping when I e-entered the tunnel to look around .
CHATTAR LAL: As she slept , she undoubtedly had nightmares . Indiana looks at him and nods .
INDIANA: Then she must have run out of the oom and you found her .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Did you discover anything in that tunnel , Dr. Jones ? Indiana stares into the rising sun .
INDIANA: Nothing . Just a dead end . That tunnel 's been deserted for years .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Well , Mr. Prime Minister , my re- port will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot .
CHATTAR LAL: I 'm sure that will please the Maharajah , Captain .
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: As I said before , we 'd be happy to escort you to Delhi .
INDIANA: Thanks , but I do n't think Willie is eady to travel yet .
WILLIE: Indy ? Did you walk to them ?
INDIANA: Yes .
WILLIE: So now they believe me .
INDIANA: Yes , they believe you . Indiana speaks in a strange monotone .
WILLIE: Then they 'll send the soldiers down into the temple
INDIANA: No they wo n't kill me .
WILLIE: You know you 've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you but I have to admit I 'd miss you if I lost you Now Indiana starts to turn slowly .
INDIANA: You wo n't lose me , Willie

INDIANA: Yes , I understand .

INDIANA: You want the stones , let them go and call off your guards !
MOLA RAM: Impressive , Dr. Jones . But I do n't believe you would kill yourself !
INDIANA: Then I guess we 're all going to take a big dive !
MOLA RAM: Give me the stones !
INDIANA: Mola Ram you 're about to meet Kali in Hell !
SHORT ROUND: Willie , look !

VIRGIL: VIRGIL VEKTOR ! Capital V I
MARCUS: You will not be disappointed , Indiana .
INDIANA: `` Sun wu Kung , The Stone Monkey King '' . Big deal . That was ten years ago , Marcus . Geez ! This Heller kid 's got the worst grammar .
MARCUS: Ten years or fifty years . It will always be in your blood .
INDIANA: Do n't believe this He spells `` repeat '' with two `` E 's '' .
MARCUS: Think back , Indiana . Remember you desire ? Your passion ?
INDIANA: Kid gets an `` A '' on contenta `` D '' on form .
MARCUS: Damn it , man ! You ca n't bury those feelings forever !
INDIANA: Two years . Nearly two years of my lifelooking for the remains of that Monkeya piece of his legendary Golden Hooped Rodo some sign of the Lost City . Nine men perished on the journey . Rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many horrible deseases we discovered We still came back empty handed .
MARCUS: One must n't give up so easily , Indiana .
INDIANA: Give up ? ! ? Marcus , we spent thirteen months in China ! anothe seven in India !
MARCUS: But none in Africa .
INDIANA: There was no proofarcheological or anthropologicalto indicate that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited Africa
MARCUS: Until now . Marcus TURNS OFF the room lights .
INDIANA: Hey My papers
MARCUS: The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke . The famous zoologist . She works in Africa , studying animals in thei natural habitat .
INDIANA: Very interesting , Marcus . Now if you 'll turn the lights back on
MARCUS: Three weeks ago , Dr. Clarke discovered that cute little fellow `` Tyki '' a pygmy of an unusual raceunrelated to any known African tribe
INDIANA: Marcus . The lights .
MARCUS: Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes from the Lost Civilization of Sun Wu-Kung .
INDIANA: What ? But how did Miss
MARCUS: `` Doctor '' .
INDIANA: `` Doctor '' Clake . How did she arrive at such a preposterous hypothesis ?
MARCUS: The pygmy speaks in a language that has no African originsbut bears a strong resemblance to Chinese .
INDIANA: Means nothing . The rivers of Africa have been plagued by various Oriental Pirates and Scavengers since the 16th Century . Not much evidence , Marcus .
MARCUS: There 's more . The pygmy was found wearing an ornamental peach stone around his neckbelieved to come from Sun Wu-Kung 's legendary Garden Of Immortal Peaches .
INDIANA: Marcus , there are countless undiscovered African tribesall with various obscure beliefs and practices One tribe may wear peach stones another may wear banana peels
MARCUS: There is one final bit of evidence
INDIANA: Enlighten me .
MARCUS: The pygmy is over 200 years old .
INDIANA: That 's impossible .
MARCUS: Dr. Clarke has done a considerable amount of testing on the pygmy 's clothinghis sandalseverything was over 200 years old .
INDIANA: He 's probably wearing his Great Grandfather 's stuff .
MARCUS: Dr. Clarke wants to mount an expedition to find the Lost City of Sun Wu-Kung . She is quite familia with your reputationshe 'd like you to come along .
INDIANA: No chance .
MARCUS: There will be money involved The museum is willing to fund the expedition
INDIANA: Sorry , Marcus . I 've burned this idge .
MARCUS: Indiana Indy TURNS . He WAVES the papers at Marcus .
INDIANA: Marcus . Please . I 've got to finish these
MARCUS: You 've got to finish something much more important . You crossed the threshold over a decade agoand it 's been tearing at your insides ever since . My friend , if there is even one iota of truth in Dr. Clarke 's findings then you can lift the veil of mystery that has surrounded this Chinese legend for Centuries . You may uncover the secrets to a Lost Civilizationand possibly , to man 's never ending search fo immortality .
BETSY: You ca n't do this to me !
INDIANA: C'mon , Betsy . Relax . You 're gettin ' 'em all wet again .
BETSY: You just ca n't go awayI mean Africa is so far away , andwell I love you , Indy .
INDIANA: Thought we agreed this was s'posed to be casual
BETSY: You call what happened last night `` casual '' .
INDIANA: My deara momentary lapse into passion does not a love affair make .
BETSY: Momentary lapse ! So that 's all I am to you ! Betsy SHOOTS to her feet , walking OFF SCREEN .
INDIANA: Betsy Wait
BETSY: If I ca n't have you I do n't want to live .
INDIANA: Drink this . You 'll feel better .
BETSY: Not like you .
INDIANA: That 's true But that 's no reason to stop living ! Besides , I 'm too old for you . By the time you 're seventy five , I 'll be Yeccchhh ! I 'll be disgusting .
BETSY: Do n't leave me , Indy !
INDIANA: Look You 're just a flighty kid . Twenty minutes after I walk out this door , you 'll have a date with the college Romeo . Two hours from now , you 'll be madly in love with him . By tomorrow , you 'll forget I eve existed .
BETSY: Never underestimate the determination of a Brooklyn girl , Doctor Jones . Never .
SCRAGGY: Indy ! At last we are reunited ! Oh , Keechingo , God Of FriendshipI thank you for granting my wish !
INDIANA: I see you have n't changed , Scraggy .
SCRAGGY: Mahootmek , God Of Goodness , say `` Before body make contact with foreign objectone must cast out ad spirits , or ``
INDIANA: `` or bad spirits will enter you ody ! ''
SCRAGGY: Yes ! You have excellent memory , Indy .
INDIANA: I should ! Last time we saw each otheryou made me wear the same clothes for 3 weeks straight .
SCRAGGY: Never separate body from clothes , o ad spirits will hide in pockets !
INDIANA: In other words If people neve changed clothesthere would be no evil in the world .
SCRAGGY: Exactly !
INDIANA: I missed all a ' your crazy philosophies , Scraggy .
SCRAGGY: They not so crazy , Indy . These days There is much evil in the air . I feel it . Everywhere .

INDIANA: Scraggy knows hundreds of languages He 's the best guide in Africa . Ask Tyki where he came from .

CLARE: And what is thethe Water Curtain Cave ?
INDIANA: Sun Wu Kung 's legendary hideoutan enormous secret cave , hidden behind a running waterfall .
SCRAGGY: Only place called '' Twisted Snake Water '' .
INDIANA: The Zarnbesi River ! It has a eputation for its deadly wate snakes
CLARE: It would have been Sun Wu Kung 's logical path .

BETSY: Do n't you know somethin ' else ? Somethin ' upbeat ?
INDIANA: We have to keep moving .
BETSY: Can we at least jump in the water ? Go for a swim ?
CLARE: There 's an old legend about the Zambesi In ancient times , criminals were given their choice of executionor swimming across the Zambesi . Most chose execution .
INDIANA: Clare 's right . We 'll be safer on the oat . Now quit moanin ' and eat your food .
BETSY: You are so rude ! I travel thousands of miles just to be with youand everybody treats me like dirt ! Nobody even talks to me without making some condescending remark they think I 'm too stupid to understand ! So maybe I do n't know a lot about weird tribal dances I 'm still pretty good with anthropology and archeology Maybe I could even help you outif somebody gave me a chanceclued me in to what it is we 're doin ' here 'Cause whether you like it or not , Indiana Jones I 'm part of this expedition , too !
SCRAGGY: My friends also curious about where we journey to , Indy .
CLARE: Tell us all a bedtime story , Docto Jones .
INDIANA: Long agoa place known as the Flower Fruit Mountain , in the Chinese province of Ao-Laiwas struck by lightning . A Stone Monkey , `` Sun Wu-Kung '' , was born .
SCRAGGY: This monkey ? He could walk ? Talk ? Like human ?
INDIANA: More than human . He was blessed with countless heavenly powers But it was n't enough . Sun Wu-Kung wanted to learn the secret of Eternal Life of Immortality Equipped with his Golden Hooped Rod to protect him , Sun Wu Kung travelled the world for many years learning the secret philosophies and teachings of Eternal Youth . Eventually , he was granted entrance to heavenwhere the Jade Empero gave Sun Wu Kung the title of `` Great Sage of the Heavens '' and permitted him to oversee the Garden of Immortal Peaches . After several years , the stone monkey returned to somewhere on earth . Here , he ruled an empirea Civilization of Monkeys and humans who had life spans of many hundred years The exact whereabouts of that Lost City has been a mystery for hundreds of yearsuntil Doctor Clarke discovered the pygmy .
BETSY: What about Sun Wu Kung ?
INDIANA: Whatever he wasa stone idolan actual monkeya human beingis unknown . But he is one of the most influentual religious figures in History , and his remains are most likely somewhere in the Lost City .
SCRAGGY: It is far , far awaymany miles
BETSY: What is it ? Some kinda ' weird animal ?
CLARE: No animal sounds like that .
SCRAGGY: Could be `` Banseebaba '' .
CLARE: Banseebaba ?
SCRAGGY: Banseebaba is giant demon from hell . He is 50 feet tall . Breathes fire . Make sound like human never hea efore . He is made up of all evil in the world !
CLARE: Cheery thought .
INDIANA: Whatever the hell it is It went to sleep for the night . Which is what we should do .
BETSY: Could n't sleep . The heat . I 'm in the mood for passion .
INDIANA: I 'm in the mood for isolation .
BETSY: I 'm not leaving . Not till I get a kiss .
INDIANA: Betsy
BETSY: One kiss . Or I 'll scream . I swear . I 'll wake the whole boat . Indiana has NO CHOICE . He SIGHS .
INDIANA: OKay . Just one . Keep your mouth closed .
CLARE: `` The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana Jones , Professor Of Perversity '' .

WHITACRE: I may tell them at some point , but not now . Right now I 'm going to follow the company line .

WHITACRE: There are things I know , but if I decide to tell you what 's going on , could I be prosecuted for it ? Draft 1/15/03 24 .
SHEPARD: I ca n't provide you with immunity , ut any information you tell me about your involvement in criminal activity would be discussed with the US attorney 's office in a favorable light .
WHITACRE: Everything I told you yesterday about Fujiwara was true except one thing . I never received a call from him on the office line . Shepard looks at Whitacre he 's confused .
SHEPARD: Why did you tell me that you did ?
WHITACRE: Before I spoke with you , Mick Andreas and Mark Cheviron coached me on what to say . They told me to tell you that the calls came in on my business line , instead of my home line .
SHEPARD: Why ?
WHITACRE: What I 'm about to tell you involves something very large . This extortion attempt by Fujiwara is nothing compared to it . Shepard says nothing .
SHEPARD: Who told you to participate in these price fixing talks ? Whitacre pauses , summons his conviction .
WHITACRE: I 'm operating under the direction of Mick and Dwayne Andreas .
ALEXANDER: Who 's Dad talking to ?
GINGER: A friend who needs his help .
WHITACRE: Mick and Cheviron had me call Fujiwara today and tell him to stop calling until things cool off .
SHEPARD: They told you to tell him to stop calling ? Draft 1/15/03 26 .
WHITACRE: They 're afraid of what you guys might find out . Can you give me a tape recorder ? I can prove this if you give me a tape recorder . I 'll take a polygraph if that helps . Shepard is out of pages in his notebook .
SHEPARD: I want to thank you for being honest with me tonight .
WHITACRE: You 're not going to ask questions at ADM about all this ? It 'd be my job for sure .
SHEPARD: No , what was said here was confidential . I 'm going to speak to my superiors Mark , and then we 'll be in touch .
SHEPARD: It 's Brian . I just got done talking to Whitacre , there 's something much igger going on here .
CHEVIRON: What happened last night ?
WHITACRE: They put a recorder on my line .
CHEVIRON: And that 's it ?
WHITACRE: Yeah , and I was instructed that when Fujiwara calls , I 'm to record the conversation . Whitacre gets buzzed by his secretary .
LIZ TAYLOR: Your wife on two .
CHEVIRON: Well , make sure you do it because they have ways of checking to see if you 're going to or not .
WHITACRE: OK0Kslow down tell me what happened Whitacre listens , leafs through his mail .
SHEPARD: .a pound of bacon , a peanut utter sandwich , some vitamins- anything that ADM has a hand in it 's all fixed , that 's what he 's telling me . Basically , everyone in this country is the victim of corporate crime by the time they finish breakfast
PAISLEY: So , what do we have ? Anti-trust violations , providing false information
SHEPARD: He told me that the motto at ADM is '' The competitors are ou friends , and the customers are ou enemies . '' Draft 1/15/03 29 .
MEDFORD: Did you discuss with him the notion of wearing a wire ? Is he willing to
SHEPARD: One potential problem I see going forward with ADM is this guy Cheviron . He wants to be kept in the loop on everything we 're doing .
WHITACRE: You told me they were only going to tap one line !
CHEVIRON: They are only monitoring one line .
WHITACRE: That 's not true . Not true . I just talked to my wife and some woman named Regina from the phone company called saying both our lines are tapped . My home phone !
CHEVIRON: Come on , the phone company does n't call people and say , ` hello just thought we 'd let you know , the FBI is tapping your phone lines . '
WHITACRE: Then why would Regina say that ?
CHEVIRON: She did n't say it , you 're saying it .
WHITACRE: Call my wife . Call Regina .
CHEVIRON: Fine , Mark . I will . Whitacre storms out .
SHEPARD: FBI . Shepard .
ANDREAS: We 've decided that we 're not going to be cooperating with any furthe FBI requests .
WHITACRE: I knew it ! I knew it ! I knew we should never have done this . I told you , but you would n't listen . They said just the office line
CHEVIRON: Evidently , they were lying to us , too .
WHITACRE: Sounds to me like you ca n't keep track of what the FBI is doing . The phone buzzes .
WHITACRE: I 'm working on this deal in Sweden , I have to take this .
CHEVIRON: I told Shepard we 're done working with them as of now .
ANDREAS: Damn right . Whitacre picks up the phone . It 's not Sweden .
WHITACRE: Yeah , hey it 's good to hear from you .
ANDREAS: You let me know and I 'll pass it on to my Dad . But , you 're done talking to them
PAISLEY: The only listening device was the ecorder , Mark .
SHEPARD: We had a trap and trace device on the home line but we ca n't listen in with that .
PAISLEY: However , the phone company calling people and telling them about ou Intel gathering is , well , our face is red on that one .
SHEPARD: Did you bring the expense reports we talked about ? Whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork . Draft 1/15/03 34 .
WHITACRE: It 's all there Tokyo , Hong Kong , Paris and Mexico City .
SHEPARD: When 's the next meeting ?
WHITACRE: January somewhere in Asia .
AGENT PAISLEY: Mark , I got ta ask you , why are you doing this ? We know you lied to us about the phone line and you 're afraid of that . But , now you 're telling us all this other stuff out of the blue . I got ta ask you why ? The light disappears from Whitacre 's eyes .
WHITACRE: Things are going on I do n't approve of . I mean , I 'm a biochemist But , they pulled me into the business side and they 're doing things that are illegal . They said
SHEPARD: You look at yourself as wearing a white hat and they 're wearing black hats .
WHITACRE: That 's a good way to put it . You know , when I was a kid my folks died in an automobile accident . I was maybe six at the time and this wealthy man in Ohio adopted me . He owned amusement parks and he did eal well for himself , real well . I got a big break went to a good school and all I adopted two kids of my own . I just want to do the ight thing .
PAISLEY: Well , Mark , do you think you 'd be willing to go a few steps furthe in helping us ?
WHITACRE: What do you mean ?
SHEPARD: Would you be willing to wear a wire ? We do n't have any othe sources at this time . We need you help .
PAISLEY: Now you realize that by doing this , sometime down the line you could e the guy who has to testify against your fellow executives , people you 've worked with now fo years . That wo n't be easy .
SHEPARD: I 'll use my beeper to signal you when it 's time to set up a meeting .
PAISLEY: You 'll be risking a lot .
WHITACRE: I was up in Wisconsin last week and the guy who is running fo Governor
AN DREAS: Tommy Thompson .
WILSON: The Republican guy .
WHITACRE: I was told they want funds a campaign contribution , but I told them we 're already at out limit .
ANDREAS: You can go over the limit it 's just a small fine . Draft 1/15/03 37 .
WILSON: That 's what I was saying . If they want a thousand dollars you give a thousand . So what if it ends up costing us nine thousand after the fine .
WHITACRE: Twelve thousand after taxes . The men laugh .
ANDREAS: If the guy 's asking you for money , try not giving it to him and see what happens . Just make sure Dad is ehind it Is Dad asking for them ?
WILSON: Yeah .
ANDREAS: Okay then .
WHITACRE: I 'll let Howard know .

SHEPARD: Mark , you do n't know how to read a polygraph .

HERNDON: And what about the price fixing ? It is n't over is it ? There 's no `` new attitude . ''
DEFEATED: There 's been meetings all along in the past three weeks even . Nothing 's changed

WHITACRE: I guess I should probably keep this , huh ? Shepard freezes the tape triumphantly .
ROBIN MANN: Where 's the agreement ? There 's just a discussion .
HERNDON: If this is n't an agreement , then what are they doing there ?
SHEPARD: Do n't get bogged down in the words , look at the actions .
ROBIN MANN: I 've looked . I see a chart with a unch of numbers . But , I ca n't pinpoint any agreement per se .
HERN DON: What do you want ? The guy is standing there dividing up the market plain as day .

HERNDON: That 's why we need these lysine association meetings on US soil.. .Make it easier to wrap this up . Shepard picks up the recorder .
SHEPARD: You ca n't use any of our equipment .
IKEDA: Good morning , we are late .
WHITACRE: No problem , no problem , you lost twenty- thousand tons , but , hey
LYSINE EXEC: Things are going well . Whitacre conceals the recorder .
WHITACRE: Want to get back in there .
MCDEERE: Does n't the dog ever get the bone ?
TARRANCE: Yeah , I hear it happens every once in awhile . It 's a disaster , they can never get that dog to run again .
MCDEERE: A million dollars .
TARRAANCE: What ?
MC DEERE: A million dollars in a numbered account in Switzerland . IBG Bank International in Zurich .
TARRANCE: You sure as hell turned greedy overnight .
MCDEERE: .And my brother out now .
TARRANCE: Your brother is a convicted felon , Mitch .
MCDEERE: Then get yourself another snitch .
GINGER: Were you with Brian and Bob all this time ?
WHITACRE: Yeah , we had to go over some tapes and
GINGER: Mark , Brian called I know you were n't with him . Busted .
WHITACRE: I needed to unwind .
GINGER: You 've seen that picture like five times now
WHITACRE: What 's wrong with that ?
GINGER: What 's wrong ? Why is your chest shaved , Mark ? Why are there holes cut in your suit clothes ? Why are n't you a part of this family anymore ?
WHITACRE: You know they needed to shave me for the tape recorder . They needed to I 'm a part
GINGER: I need you at home , the kids need you to be their father .
WHITACRE: I 'm doing all this for you and the kids . I did n't ask for this but I want to give this family everything . That 's why I 'm working so much .
GINGER: I do n't know who you work fo anymore , Mark . Do you ? A beat . He smiles warmly at her .
WHITACRE: Hey guys , I was in the neighborhood . I got some more tapes .
SHEPARD: Thanks , Mark . Come on in .
WHITACRE: And I 've learned some important things recently . I 've been told I 'm probably going to be the next President of ADM . He glows .
HERNDON: Really ?
SHEPARD: Who told you that ? Draft 1/15/03 72 .
WHITACRE: And that 's not all . I 'd say that ten of the products produced by ADM are price fixed .
SHEPARD: Ten ?
WHITACRE: I would estimate that for all the companies involved , the total extra profit is in the range of 800 million to one billion dollars . That 's just from the price-fixing .
SHEPARD: Can you tell us what products ?
WHITACRE: You know , Brian , if all these companies are charged , they 're going to be paying an awful lot in fines . Do n't you think ?
SHEPARD: I do n't know , they might end up paying . But , nobody knows for sure how this will turn out .
HERNDON: We still need to get everyone together making an actual agreement efore we have a case .
WHITACRE: Sure , sure I know that . But , I 've taken a lot of risks and I need to think about my family .
SHEPARD: What do you mean ?
WHITACRE: Well , I 'd like it if , in thei fine , ADM was ordered to pay me ten year 's salary .
SHEPARD: Well , Mark
WHITACRE: It 's only fair . Also , one othe thing .
SHEPARD: I ca n't grant you immunity Mark , you know that .
HERNDON: Hey , Mark , it 's kind of warm in here why do n't you take off you jacket , sit down and we can talk about this .
WHITACRE: Oh , no , Bob , that 's okay . Let me know if you want to reconsider . Whitacre leaves . Herndon looks at Shepard .
SHEPARD: What was that about ?
GINGER: Mark , what are you doing ?
WHITACRE: You want to be someone living in some small house ? You want to be like those people who ca n't afford cars for their kids ? Draft 1/15/03 75 .
GINGER: You 're not better than somebody else because you have more cars o a bigger salary . Or some stables across the road . You used to know that , you used to know what mattered . You need to find that out again you need to turn to God .
WHITACRE: I do n't need God .
SCHMIDT: Remind me , ABP deal ?
WHITACRE: Threonine microbe , they 've made some substantial improvements and we need to get it into the market . I got the invoice somewhere
SCHMIDT: We can overnight it .
WHITACRE: Nah , I 'm gon na see this Thorstensson guy . I 'll just hand it to him .
SCHMIDT: Then I 'll get it over . Lysine 's going great guns Mark , price is up to one-twenty .
WHITACRE: Guten Morgen , Ich mochte Herr Brief finden , bitte ? The porter points toward a desk .
BRIEL: Mr. Whitacre Wie gehts ? Gut dass wir uns eben getroffen haben . The two men vanish behind a door .

IKEDA: We already know Whitacre 's score sixty seven plus alpha . More laughter .
HERNDON: Just remember I want you to poll the room and get them to use the word `` agreement . ''
WHITACRE: Okay , Bob . It 's gon na be a great meeting .
HERNDON: Let the action come to you .
WHITACRE: I got ta talk , Bob .
HERNDON: I know that
WHITACRE: I mean , I 'm representing ADM . Otherwise , everybody would be suspicious .
HERNDON: You can talk . Just do n't dominate . We want to see others involvement .
WHITACRE: Definitely .
HERNDON: It 's that time again . Draft 1/15/03 80 .
WHITACRE: Oh , sure no problem .
TERRY WILSON: We ca n't be manipulated by these Goddamn buyers . Thank God we have them , but they are not my friends .
WHITACRE: What ?
TERRY WILSON: Damn Mark , ca n't you call and get us a bigger room . This is crazy .
WHITACRE: Anyone seen my briefcase ?
MIMOTO: We move to bigger room .
WHITACRE: No , no . I do n't think they have one . Is my brief case behind the flip-chart ?
HERNDON: He left it in his room .
WHITACRE: Yeah , it 's just there 's more of us than we expected . Nothing larger ? Really ? Can you check again
SHEPARD: Thatta boy , Mark .
TERRY WILSON: I 'd like to welcome everybody here , glad everyone could make it and sorry for those who ca n't play golf tomorrow we 're gon na have a good time . Whitacre 's POV he scans the room .
MIMOTO: Outside piss ? Language problem again .
TERRY WILSON: It 's better to be part of the group .
WHITACRE: Competitors are our friends , emember ? Customers the enemy .
MIMOTO: I explain it to you on the phone many times
TERRY WILSON: If the market is what we think it is
WHITACRE: We have a couple other people joining us I think ?
MR. CHAUDRET: From Sewon in Korea .
MIMOTO: And one from the FBI ?
WHITACRE: And seven from the Federal Trade Commission .
MIMOTO: Yes ? FTC ?
HERNDON: This was left in the lobby . The concierge thought it might belong to one of you gentleman .
WHITACRE: Okay . Hey , thanks . Herndon closes the door . Draft 1/15/03 85 .
MR. CHAUDRET: You forgot your briefcase in the lobby ?
WHITACRE: When I was signing for the food I must 've left it .
MR. CHAUDRET: In Paris it would have already been sold . More laughter .
SUH: How can we know ADM will stay at agreed upon levels ?
TERRY WILSON: Our preference is to trust each other . If we find someone lyin ' then we hire some mafia figure and ub you out . The group laughs .
MIMOTO: You are okay for that ? A beat .
SUH: Yeah , I 'm all right .
WHITACRE: So what are we saying then ? Wilson looks at Whitacre like he 's an idiot .
TERRY WILSON: What , is there a language problem here ?
WHITACRE: So , everyone is , uh
MIMOTO: Agreed . Uh , five companies agree on quantity for the first time .
SHEPARD: Agreement you heard it . He hits rewind and plays it again .
MUTCHNIK: Christ , how about this guy Whitacre ? What 's his story ?
SHEPARD: What do you mean ?
MUTCHNIK: What 's his agenda ? The guy 's making 350 grand a year , he 's moving up the ladder and he turns informer . When does that happen ? Is the money going up his nose ? Some woman somewhere with a kid that he 's seeing on one of these business trips ? What 's his story ?
HERNDON: I wanted everyone to see this . This is Mark Whitacre and his family .
ROBIN MANN: What 's he looking for ?
SHEPARD: About eighteen grand a month . He hands her a folder of Whitacre 's expenses .
WHITACRE: Hey , Brian , how do you like it ? Shepard takes in the car .
SHEPARD: It 's a beauty . How was Hong Kong ?
WHITACRE: Real good we 're going to be taking the lysine prices up again . He hands Shepard an envelope .
SHEPARD: We 're gon na wan na hear how the company responds when we move in .
WHITACRE: That 's okay , Brian . It 's kind of packed with work anyway .
GINGER: Mark , are you an idiot ?
WHITACRE: I 'm gon na be the only one left . Dwayne will be gone . Mick will be gone . Terry will be gone . I 'm going to be the only one who can un ADM .
GINGER: That 's totally illogical . How can you possibly stay there when you 've dust taken down the company ? You think they 're going to pat you on the back ?
WHITACRE: I 'm next in line .
GINGER: It 's the FBI , right ? They 're ainwashing you . Brian Shepard put these ideas in your head to keep you working for him .
WHITACRE: I 'm telling you , they 're gon na make me president .
WHITACRE: They 're good . They 'll be at an amusement park when you guys make your move .
ROBIN MANN: Whatever happens tomorrow , it may e in your best interest to get an attorney who represents you interests alone . Whitacre is confused .
WHITACRE: You want me to go and hire an attorney now ?
HERNDON: No , not now
MUTCHNIK: The first thing that 's going to happen is the company lawyers are going to come to all the executives with a list of attorneys for you to pick from . You got ta understand , these attorneys are being paid by ADM . They do n't represent you . Do not take one of these attorneys , that 's when you say to them that you have your own attorney .
SHEPARD: Tell them you 've decided to cooperate with the government .
MUTCHNIK: It 's perfectly reasonable for you to cooperate . It happens all the time .
WHITACRE: Well , I know a lawyer in Decatur
SHEPARD: No , Mark . The town 's too small .
MUTCHNIK: I 'm sure you 've met lawyers in you usiness dealings who can handle this . Draft 1/15/03 91 .
WHITACRE: Oh , definitely . He searches his mind for who that might be .
SHEPARD: Now , Mark once this thing starts it 's going to be intense . They 're going to know that somebody was on the inside working with us . They 're going to do almost anything to find out who it is .
WHITACRE: You guys still think everything will work out okay for me at the company ? They 'll take out the bad guys , but I 'll be okay ?
TERRY WILSON: Come on Mark , you 're making that up .
WHITACRE: No , it 's true . Archer , The `` A '' in ADM , choked to death on a chicken one in 1947 .
TERRY WILSON: There you have it from Mark Whitacre , Ph.D. You know what the Ph.D. is for ? Piled Higher and Deeper .
VISITING CLIENT: And let me guess , Daniels was killed by a pig and the cows got Midland ? Booze soaked laughter all around .
TERRY WILSON: So , a chicken got Archer but fifty years later when you look at our deals with Tyson , Foster Farms what 's the body count ?
HERNDON: Excuse me . Mr. Wilson , Mr. Whitacre I 'm Bob Herndon and I 'm an FBI agent . This is Special Agent Shepherd .
SHEPARD: Why do n't we step over there .
TERRY WILSON: I have no idea what this is .
WHITACRE: Attorney ? Christ .
HERNDON: Mr. Whitacre , if I can ask you to step outside with Agent Shepard and Mr. Wilson , if you could have a seat .
STUNNED WAITRESS: Would you like to see the dessert menu ?
TERRY WILSON: You have a reason for embarrassing my colleague and I in front of a usiness prospect ?
HERNDON: Mr. Wilson you 're president over at Archer Daniels Midland Corporation , correct ?
TERRY WILSON: I run the corn business .
HERNDON: This is a serious matter . It involves an international investigation into price fixing
SHEPARD: Why do n't we talk in the car .
HERNDON: We 've seen you and your boss , Mick Andreas , conspire with you competitors to fix prices . We 've seen you tell others to do it . Draft 1/15/03 94 .
HERNDON: A chance to be able to look you grandchildren in the eye someday and tell them you did the right thing
WHITACRE: Look at that , look at Bob and Terry . Man , I 'd love to be a fly on the wall for that one . I was good was n't I ? I seemed scared .
SHEPARD: Remember what we told you , Mark tell them that you 're cooperating first thing and whatever you do , do not take one of their lawyers .
WHITACRE: What did you say to your guy ?
TERRY WILSON: Nothing . I told him nothing . Slow down .
WHITACRE: Me , too .
TERRY WILSON: He said he had tapes that he 'd heard price fixing tapes . . .What the fuck is that ? I ca n't believe they would pull this shit on Dwayne Andreas
WHITACRE: I bet they tapped the phones I always said that about them . I bet it 's phone calls .
TERRY WILSON: Maybe , but what 's that ?
WHITACRE: You know , I get phone calls from time to time , Terry .
TERRY WILSON: I know , I know . Draft 1/15/03 96 .
ANDREAS: We 're going to the lawyers I do n't want to use the phones .
WHITACRE: See , the phones .
ANDREAS: They hit everyone my Dad , Schmidt , Randall
WILSON: Fuck me .
ANDREAS: They played me a tape of me some meeting with the fucking japs . I called the lawyers.. .They want us to go there .
TERRY WILSON: They played a fucking tape !
ANDREAS: I really do n't think they 've got that much and when you factor in everything we 've ever done for them .It 'll be a ten year thing fo the lawyers then there 'll be some deal , maybe a fine.. .That 's all it 'll ever be .
SHEPARD: Do you think it went well ?
HERNDON: I do n't think I would change a thing . A phone rings somewhere an agent answers .
PHONE AGENT: I got Agent Temples for Attorney Mutchnik .
AGENT TEMPLES: I just interviewed an ADM employee , Kirk Schmidt
MUTCHNIK: Bob , Brian can I talk to you guys for a second
WHITACRE: You guys were great . I mean you scared the hell out of Terry and you should 've seen Mick and the lawyers .
SHEPARD: That 's super , Mark .
WHITACRE: And the best part is , they think you gave me the once over .
HERNDON: Did you make a tape ?
WHITACRE: Yeah , and it 's good stuff . It 's eal good . He hands the agents the tape .
SHEPARD: Mark , who did you tell ?
WHITACRE: What ? What do you mean ?
SHEPARD: Who did you tell about the raid . Shepard is furious , he glares at Whitacre .
WHITACRE: Hey , I had to tell my secretary . I told her a long time ago . I just said , `` look I 'm working with the FBI on some things , I may be out of touch for a while . That 's all Shepard still glares .
SHEPARD: Why did you do that , Mark ? Why did you tell Dougherty ?
WHITACRE: Like I said , I did n't want her to e scared . And I can trust her . Guys , I can trust her . Shepard glares in harder , his voice cracking .
SHEPARD: Who else ? Draft 1/15/03 100 .
WHITACRE: MmmKirk Schmidt . I wanted to let him know it was okay to talk with you ` cuz he might not on account of he 's loyal to me . Shepard explodes .
SHEPARD: You could have ruined this entire operation . Two and a half years Herndon intervenes .
HERNDON: Time out . Mark , you know what you did was wrong in our eyes Whitacre starts to speak .
WHITACRE: No , I ca n't think of anything , Bob .
DWAYNE ANDREAS: Mark Whitacre , this is Aubrey Daniel .
AUBREY DANIEL: Pleasure meeting you . I 'm epresenting ADM in this matter . And this is a colleague of mine John Dowd . Dwayne 's told me about your responsibilities here
DWAYNE ANDREAS: Aubrey defended Lt. Calley afte the My Lai massacre in Viet Nam So this ought to be a cake walk for him .
AUBREY DANIEL: We thought you might take some time and talk to John here .
MICK ANDREAS: ADM 's going to stand behind you on this , Mark . Dad and I want the key people to know we 'll be paying their legal fees .
WHITACRE: Great , that 's great .
DWAYNE ANDREAS: Then we 'll let you fellas get acquainted .
JOHN DOWD: How you holding up , Mark ? Draft 1/15/03 102 .
WHITACRE: Uh , can I ask you something ?
JOHN DOWD: Sure . Anything .
WHITACRE: If I tell you something are you allowed to say anything to Mick o Dwayne ?
JOHN DOWD: No question about it .
WHITACRE: I 'm sorry for what 's happened .
ANDREAS: Sorry ? What 's that ?
AUBREY DANIEL: John , I bet that SOB was wearing a wire on you tonight , too .
WHITACRE: Hey . . .Good morning . Draft 1/15/03 104 .

AUBREY DANIEL: Mark , we 'd like you off the premises .
WHITACRE: Uh , Mr. Daniel , ca n't we
AUBREY DANIEL: Management wants you out
WHITACRE: But , I 'm a VP here
CHEVIRON: Let 's go .
SHEPARD: Mark , you ca n't be here .
WHITACRE: They threw me out , Brian .
SHEPARD: You 're jeopardizing everything .
WHITACRE: Tossed me out of ADM . I 'm out .
SHEPARD: Not here , Mark on the phone we can set something up .
WHITACRE: You got ta help me .
SHEPARD: If you need to talk , call me .
WHITACRE: They know . They know it 's me , my lawyer told them .
SHEPARD: A lawyer ca n't do that , Mark .
WHITACRE: I know , I know I do . I just do n't know one . No ideas .
EPSTEIN: So , there was n't a saboteur in the eginning at all ? You made that up ?
WHITACRE: Maybe there was , there could 've een ADM steals technology from the Japanese so I would n't put it past the Japanese to do the same thing . But after I told them that I made it up the FBI said I did n't have much of a choice .
EPSTEIN: And you began making tapesHow many tapes did you make ?
WHITACRE: Uh , two and a half years . I was a VP and a cooperating witness . A moment of reflection and then
EPSTEIN: Mark , it 's very important to you case that you not discuss it with anyone else . These people you work with , your friends , they could end up being witnesses . So Bob and I are the only people I want you to talk to about this from now on and I want you to know you can tell us anything .
WHITACRE: Hey , thanks for taking the time . I eally appreciate it . I feel a whole lot better .
GINGER: He 's out of town .
KILMAN: My name is Scott Kilman and I 'm a eporter from the Wall Street 1 Journal Kilman gives her a business card . Draft 1/15/03 109 .
KILMAN: I know this is a difficult time fo your family . But , I 've seen how these things go before these companies really go after the whistle blowers .
GINGER: Uh , well I do n't really know about all that like I said , Mark 's away just now-But , I 'll let him know you stopped by .
LIZ TAYLOR: They turned the place upside down . Draft 1/15/03 110 . His loyal secretary gives him a pile of mail .
WHITACRE: I 'm sorry you got dragged into this .
LIZ TAYLOR: And then they started asking me fo the access code to your voice mail . Whitacre panics .
WHITACRE: Did you tell them ? I do n't think you have to tell them that .
LIZ TAYLOR: well , according to them I do but I did n't . And about two hours later Peterson told me to clean out my desk . He said I 've been transferred out of Bioproducts .
WHITACRE: But , you did n't tell them ?
KILMAN: I 'd like to talk to you about what 's been going on at ADM. A beat . He hands Whitacre a card .
WHITACRE: We better go inside . We ca n't talk out here .
EPSTEIN: Shit .
ALEXANDER: Dad , Dad , you 're on TV !
WHITACRE: Baby , you got ta come see this we 're on TV . Draft 1/15/03 113 .
REPORTER: Any comment on the effect you actions have had on the decline in ADM 's stock prices ? Whitacre cringes .
REPORTER 2: What has been the reaction of you friends and co-workers to having een taped without their knowledge ? Whitacre picks up speed toward the garage .
REPORTER 3: Do you believe you and your family can safely stay in Decatur , or has the government made arrangements to move you ? Whitacre cowers in the garage .
GINGER: We 're still getting the threatening phone calls and I know for a fact that Dwayne and Terry have been telling people he was n't a good worker . That he ca n't be trusted . Draft 1/15/03 114 .
SHEPARD: We told Mark that he had to expect the unexpected that he might be attacked that he was n't going to win any popularity contests fo this .
GINGER: He just mopes around here watching the news looking for a glimpse of himself . Or , he calls someone from ADM looking for the latest gossip .
SHEPARD: Maybe you guys should get out of town until the hearings start .
HERNDON: He 's got to stop talking to people that can really come back to bite him
GINGER: He 's very proud , you know
HERNDON: Where is he now ? Beat .
GINGER: He said he was going to see you . Draft 1/15/03 115 .
WHITACRE: They had warned me that I would need an attorney and told me not to get one tied to ADM , but they did n't stress itI spent from six to ten that night talking to John Dowd the attorney from ADM. Dowd promised me he would n't tell anyone my role . But , the next day someone at ADM called me and said , `` Hey , Dwayne told me you 're the mole . You 're the one who caused all this ''
HENKOFF: And then what happened ?
ROBERTS: You can see where he pasted it .
WHITACRE: Mark Whitacre . Draft 1/15/03 117 .
WHITACRE: You got anything open in the back ?
HERNDON: Do n't tell us anything . You have an attorney now . This is n't like efore . Let 's just talk . Shepard tries to change the subject . Draft 1/15/03 118 .
SHEPARD: You been playing any golf ? Whitacre does n't want to `` just talk . ''
WHITACRE: They want to talk to me at ADM .
HERNDON: Mark , you understand your lawye has advised you not to discuss this matter ?
SHEPARD: We 're not asking you .
WHITACRE: Let me throw out some `` hypotheticals . '' I 'll talk about some financial situations and you tell me if they 're wrong or how serious they might be , OK ? Fo instance , suppose a company gave an executive a car , you know , a corporate car . But instead of driving it to work he drove his personal car and gave the company car to his daughter . Would that be a problem ?
HERNDON: That 's it ? That 's the hypothetical ?
SHEPARD: That should n't be a problem .
WHITACRE: What about if an executive used a corporate plane for personal use ?
HERNDON: Basically , it 's the same thing .
SHEPARD: There may be some IRS issues but
WHITACRE: What if , hypothetically , the activity involved kickbacks by corporate executives ? Draft 1/15/03 119 .
HERNDON: There are plenty of ways companies try and attract business . Dinners for clients , tickets for sporting events
SHEPARD: It 's not ethical but it 's done . A beat . Then Whitacre goes on .
WHITACRE: Uh , is this conversation on or off the record ?
SHEPARD: On . Definitely . Whitacre exhales .
WHITACRE: What if the company regularly accepted kickbacks to executives in the form of cash ? Shepard drops his fork . Hold on Shepard .
SHEPARD: How much money are we talking about Mark ? Whitacre pauses , clears his throat .
WHITACRE: Five hundred thousand .
HERNDON: How much ? ? ?
WHITACRE: It 's how things were done there .
SHEPARD: When did this start , Mark ?
WHITACRE: December of 1991 . Shepard ca n't believe it .
SHEPARD: You , You And how were you paid ? Draft 1/15/03 120 .
WHITACRE: By check . They we 're deposited in various accounts . And always unde 10,000 dollars .
SHEPARD: And did any of these checks come in after we met ? Whitacre pauses .
WHITACRE: Maybe a couple . The agents try and control their anger .
SHEPARD: Who else knows about this ?
WHITACRE: Nobody . Herndon loses it .
HERNDON: Come on , Mark you just said it 's how things were done at ADM. Now , is there anything else you 're involved in ? Anything else you need to tell us ?
WHITACRE: Just what I told you .
HERNDON: I 'm asking you one more time .
WHITACRE: The 500 and that 's it . Definitely . Whitacre nods . He asks hopefully
AUBREY DANIEL: Two point five million dollars . Deposited in a bank in Switzerland while Mark Whitacre was on ADM usiness . We have sworn testimony from Mr. Lennart Thorstensson of the ABP Corporation that he 's neve seen this contract before and that his signature has been forged . He and his company never received this check
SHEPARD: What are they accusing me of ? I want the specifics ? Are they saying I 'm in cahoots with the guy ?
MEDFORD: Paragraph eight in our agreement with Whitacre states that his actions are directly attributable to the FBI and the US
SHEPARD: But , how could we know what he was doing ? He came to us
PAISLEY: The question they 're asking is n't ` how could we know ? ' It 's ` why did n't we know ? '
HERNDON: The question is ` were they fixing prices ? ' Medford and Paisley share a look .
MEDFORD: The investigation has shifted from ADM to Whitacre .
SHEPARD: Of course , ADM decides Whitacre 's a thief as soon as they find out he 's working for us .
HERNDON: Who 's counting the money over there if they can just lose 2.5 Million dollars for a few years and then find it in a few hours ?
SHEPARD: We got ta call Mark .
PAISLEY: I do n't want you doing that . Shepard and Herndon are confused .
MEDFORD: We 're taking you off . Draft 1/15/03 124 .
SHEPARD: That 's it . We 're done ? I thought the FBI never hung a witness out to dry .
MEDFORD: He 's not a witness anymore- he 's a target .
WHITACRE: I only kept a million and a half and Mick knew about it , he knew these things went on . They taught me how to do it . Zaideman and Epstein shake their heads .
EPSTEIN: You ca n't bullshit these people tomorrow . Who knows what they know ? If we 're going in there we got to go in with the whole story . Because the way it gets bad for you is if you tell them you 're confessing and you do n't . Then you are sorely screwed . Whitacre looks at his shoe box . He nods .
WHITACRE: This is everything Jim , what I 'm telling you here . I looked everywhere for the bank statements and the records . This is every penny I 'm not gon na hide anything from you guys .
ZAIDEMAN: What ?
EPSTEIN: We got to get you out of here .
WHITACRE: No . I want to tell them . Hold on Epstein .
ROBIN MANN: Mr. Whitacre 's conduct constitutes a breach of his agreement with the US government . He is no longer a cooperating witness .
EPSTEIN: My client has given you years of his life , clearly he made mistakes , ut he made your case .
ROBIN MANN: We 're not here to discuss the case against ADM .
HERBST: Mr. Whitacre , my name is Ed Herbst and I 'm with the FBI Economic Crimes Unit . I 'd like you to tell me when your criminal conduct at ADM began .
WHITACRE: In early 1992 . I learned how things were done there from Mick Andreas . He 's the one who taught me how to use embezzlement and kickbacks to make money tax free . Epstein tries to do some damage control .
EPSTEIN: My client is
WHITACRE: I know the frauds I committed are wrong , and I accept responsibility for them .
HERBST: How did you receive the money ?
WHITACRE: Primarily by check . I deposited them in my bank account in Decatur . This seems unlikely . Spearing gets angry
MARY SPEARING: They paid kickbacks in checks ? What company would pay kickbacks in checks ? Come on
WHITACRE: I do n't really remember the exact name something like AgriConsulting and Trading , something like that
MARY SPEARING: You do n't remember the name of the company that paid you checks ? Draft 1/15/03 127 .
WHITACRE: I . .I 've got a lot going on in my life . It 's hard to remember .
EPSTEIN: Hey , we 're coming to you guys . We 're cooperating here and we 're going to get the money back .
HERBST: This might help your memory .
WHITACRE: Where did you get that ?
HERBST: These are ADM records showing the forging of signatures .
MARY SPEARING: Is there anything else you have a hard time remembering ?
WHITACRE: UmmI have a few other things to tell you about . Epstein sighs .
HERNDON: We ca n't see you anymore and if you call us and start to talk about it , we 'll have to hang up
SHEPARD: You can talk to us about you feelings , but that 's it .
WHITACRE: I 'll tell you what , my frustration and anger is all coming from my work with you guys . I mean , this stuff in the papers , my kids read that . It 's all , `` Dump on Mark Whitacre . '' It 's not right . I 'm harassed by the media and Mick and Terry are still going to work in the morning .
SHEPARD: Remember , Mark , we told you it was impossible to predict what would happen when the case went overt .
HERNDON: And you never told us about the Five Million Dollars you took
GINGER: He worked for you for two and a half years , he risked his career , his home.. .And now you turn you ack on him and leave us out here .
WHITACRE: Ginger But the damn has burst . She sobs .
SHEPARD: The reason we came today is because we are concerned about your and Mark 's well being .
HERNDON: It 's important that you tell the people in Washington everything tomorrow one hundred per cent . Whitacre nods . Ginger seethes .
GINGER: You 'd have nothing without him and you know it . He 's just been used y the government and then thrown away cuz ' it 's a lot easier to go after Mark Whitacre than anyone named Andreas . Whitacre stares at the newspapers . Draft 1/15/03 130 .
WHITACRE: You 'll be OK here with your mom ?
ROBIN MANN: Mr. Whitacre will not be appearing today
D' ANGELO: Whitacre 's not coming .
SHEPARD: This morning ?
RUSTY: Jesus , no . Somebody help .
WHITACRE: Bud , pull the car back into the garage . Pull back in before somebody sees me .
RUSTY: Jesus , Mark , what are you doing ?
WHITACRE: YouYou fucking God . You owe me . You fucking God . After everything I did .
RUSTY: Ginger , can you come to the garage ?
GINGER: I 'm not coming down there unless you tell me what 's wrong .
RUSTY: Mark just tried to kill himself and
ALEXANDER: Dad ? Ginger turns to her MOTHER .
GINGER: That Goddam Dwayne Andreas did this to him , Mom . He ought to be killed .
WHITACRE: .Walk back in with a bag full of jewelry .
MILLER: You never thought you 'd get caught ?
WHITACRE: That never occurred to me . I mean , I look respectable . Why would they search me ? And now they 're saying I stole 5 Million dollars . That 's what I 've been accused of .
MILLER: Did you ?
WHITACRE: Yeah . They were paying me 500 grand , but it was n't enough , I was spending more like eight . So , I took kickbacks . Like I said , it 's just what you did if you wanted to e part of the gang at ADM .
MILLER: Is that how it was when you were a kid ; you wanted to be part of the gang ? Draft 1/15/03 134 . Whitacre nods .
WHITACRE: One time I got a brand new , top of the line bicycle . And I bragged to everyone about it . I told everybody how much it cost . A beat . Then proudly .
MILLER: How did you come to work for the
WHITACRE: They approached me . This does n't make much sense to Miller .
MILLER: How is it that they came to you ? Did they know about the price fixing ?
WHITACRE: This agent , Brian Shepard came to a number of junior executives at ADM That 's why they approached me . The price fixing had n't even started yet Miller is confused by this .
MILLER: But , uh , if no crime was , then-Mark , I 'd like to have you checked into the hospital . Whitacre looks over at a file cabinet .
WHITACRE: Is thatwhereyou keep your files ? Is thatsafe ? I 'm the main witness againstthesepeople . You do n't know whoyou 're dealing with they'lldo anything to win .
GINGER: He just kept buying things . We have eight cars three of them we never even use .
MILLER: Anything else ?
GINGER: I was always the one with the temper and Corky was the happy one ut that 's changed too . Since he said he 'd cooperate with the FBI he 's become so intolerant of everyone
MILLER: Why do you call him Corky ?
GINGER: He 's had that name since high school . He was like a champagne cork always flying off somewhere .
WHITACRE: There 's one in Hong Kong . And then there 's the bank accounts in Switzerland and Grand CaymanOther things-There 's a lawyer in New York who has a million dollars of mine .
MILLER: And have you told your attorney the truth about all of these accounts ? Draft 1/15/03 136 .
WHITACRE: No , but I do n't need to . The othe assets are legal definitely .
MILLER: You need to tell your attorney
WHITACRE: I do n't know if I can trust him .
MILLER: Mark , has anybody in your family ever been diagnosed as bipolar o manic-depressive ? Whitacre nods and leans in .
WHITACRE: I had an Aunt who they said that about , my real parents died when I was pretty young and I was adopted
LAWYER: Have you ever heard that Mark told people he was adopted ?
WHITACRE'S MOM: Right .
LAWYER: According to the adoption story Mark told , his parents we 're killed in a car accident . Is there any truth in that ?
WHITACRE'S MOM: No . Mark knows he 's not adopted . He grew up in our house . Draft 1/15/03 137 .
LAWYER: Another aspect of the story is that his parents are wealthy . Do you consider yourself wealthy ?
WHITACRE'S MOM: No .
LAWYER: And when did Mark first send you a check from the account in Switzerland ?
EPSTEIN: My client is here to cooperate fully , so Agent D'Angelo , if you have any questions .
D' ANGELO: This is your chance to put everything on the table . This is the chance to redeem yourself , but if you 're not going to be completely honest you should stop talking now .
WHITACRE: I understand that . And I want to tell you I feel bad . I 'm so sorry , and I feel worst about letting down Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon . Last time we talked I was under a great deal of stress and I said some things that were n't true . I 'd like to clear that up .
D' ANGELO: Was anyone else involved ? Draft 1/15/03 138 .
WHITACRE: Uh , Sid Hulse
ZENNER: Before Sid says anything , you know about these schemes with the Nigerian letters ?
AGENT GRANT: The 419 Fraud ? We see it every day .
ZENNER: You ever wonder who was dumb enough to fall for something like that ? Hulse is flushed .
HULSE: This is really embarrassing . But , that 's how Mark and I first got involved financially
WHITACRE: Then there was Rheinhard Richte who I worked with in Mexico . We had some deal that involved
AGENT BASSET: So we have money leaving you account here and here and here and it 's going to Whitacre 's accountHis wife Ginger 's account . This one is going to Whitacre 's parents account .
RICHTER: Like I said , those are loans . Agent Basset is n't buying it . Draft 1/15/03 139 .
AGENT BASSET: Look we know you 're sticking up fo Mark here , but your story does n't seem true . Mark is cooperating now . Richter folds .
RICHTER: You 're right . It 's not true . All the money went to Mark .
AGENT BASSET: When did it start ?
RICHTER: Mark told me about this Nigerian thing he got in the mail .
WHITACRE: And then there was Marty Allison . Marty 's a good friend .
MARTY ALLISON: Mark told you guys about Nigeria , ight ? Nobody says anything .
WHITACRE: Hey , Marty , got a minute .
AGENT BASSET: He 'd never heard of the Nigerian scam ?
MARTY ALLISON: Not until a couple years later when sixty minutes ran a piece on it showing how people had lost a fortune on the con .
AGENT BASSET: And the kickbacks ?
MARTY ALLISON: He had me set up a company in Germany and send fake invoices . I 'd get a check for like 200 grand and most of it would go back to Mark .
AGENT BASSET: You kept the rest .
MARTY ALLISON: He told me management knew about it . But , it seemed to me that he was doing the same thing to ADM , that the Nigerians had done to us .
D' ANGELO: How much money did you receive through all your illegal activities ?
WHITACRE: Uh7.7 Million dollars . But , Mick knew . Like I said , he endorsed these things .
D' ANGELO: He endorsed you stealing 7.7 Million dollars ?
WHITACRE: He might have though that was a bit much .
D' ANGELO: Is there anything else you want to tell us ?
WHITACRE: Well , I think you did a real good job today I do know that ADM has een stealing microbes from the Japanese for years and that they use prostitutes to get information from the competition 's facility in Iowa . I know that Mick Andreas uses cocaine and I have that on tape and there are illegal campaign contributions to both American and foreign politicians And under
EPSTEIN: We hear this all the time from you guys , how easy it is for trained agents to crack . And here is MarkA civilian with no training .
WHITACRE: Tomorrow , 3 O'clock where we talked about .
EPSTEIN: Mark committed a crime . He stole nine million dollars . It 's indefensible . But these guys from ADM stole hundreds of millions of dollars from innocent people all over the world . Mark showed you that four white guys in suits getting together in the middle of the day , is n't a business meeting . It 's a crime scene . And not only did he tell you about it , he got you the evidence to prove it . Now , we 're not looking for the moon and stars . We 're looking for something in the area of three years.. .Or we can take it to trial . And in that trial I 'll lay out everything Mark Whitacre did good and bad Draft 1/15/03 143 .
WHITACRE: Baby . . .Ginger . They grabbed me . There were two of them .
GINGER: Oh my God
WHITACRE: They would n't let me out of the car .
GINGER: Look at your shirt.. .what happened ?
WHITACRE: I was abducted . They took me for a twenty-minute joy ride and told me that I basically better forget everything that 's not on tape .
GINGER: And they sawed the locks off the door like , like mafia thugs .
ON TV: What people have to realize is the FBI did the same thing . They locked my husband in an investigation and drove our family around for three years threatening him . You tell me , where are they now ? He is stung by her words .
ON TV: I had a lot of faith in the guys at the FBI they always said they 'd take care of me .
WHITACRE: Three to five years ? But , ADM 's the bad guys .
EPSTEIN: You 've got to focus here . You stole nine million dollars . And then you lied about it . Maybe in your head you 're one of the good guys but to them your a guy who stole a lot of money and lied about it .
WHITACRE: Ginger and I have been talking and we 'd like to file a law suit against Brian Shepard and the IJS government .
EPSTEIN: Jesus Christ , for what , Mark ?
WHITACRE: He hit me with a brief case .
EPSTEIN: Mark . . .Come on .
WHITACRE: And he told me to destroy certain tapes that did n't help the case . Epstein throws up his hands .
EPSTEIN: Mark , I 'm telling you take the plea . Whitacre smiles and looks at Ginger .
WHITACRE: Thanks , Jim . But , we 're going to go a different way . Draft 1/15/03 146 .
WALKER: This all goes back many years , efore most of us were born It 's bigger than any of us , and it 's ongoing . I know you 're skeptical , but I 've seen it . My client Mark Whitacre has shown it to me . Maybe I 'm just a personal injury lawyer from Taylorville- nowhere-Illinois , but I tell you I know the identity of the maste puppeteer . The DOJ lawyers try not to laugh .
MARY SPEARING: The who ?
WALKER: Master puppeteer , and it 's not who you 're thinking .
SHEPARD: I read the letter from Docto Miller , Mark . It 's not true .
WHITACRE: It 's true . Definitely it 's on his letterhead , he signed it
SHEPARD: The area code Mark
WHITACRE: Well , everybody knew the area code change was coming . Lot 's of people ordered new stationery early .
SHEPARD: I thought about that . So I asked the phone company . This is the press release announcing the 847 area code He puts the release on the table . Draft 1/15/03 149 .
GINGER: Stop it
WHITACRE SHEPARD: Call Henkoff He never wrote the letter .
GINGER: Stop it , Mark . You have to stop doing this to yourself , please stop . Whitacre is done . Draft 1/15/03 150 .
WHITACRE: I think maybe I should go back to the hospital .
CLERK: Case 97-2001 United states of America versus Mark Whitacre .
JUDGE BAKER: You have the right to make a statement if you wish ? Whitacre nods and stands .
WHITACRE: I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words , it 's been a long five years . I apologize to a lot of people in this room
JUDGE BAKER: To observe that Mr. Whitacre is the usual felon is a gross understatement . He is well educated , has a loving wife and family , is respected in the community . It is not inconceivable that in due course he may have ecome CEO of Archer Daniels Midland
WHITACRE: Mick and Terry held up every grocery store in the world and they only got three So you tell me how it makes sense that I get nine . I think that 's something you should consider , Mr. President , when eviewing my request for pardon .
HERNDON: Good luck with the appeal , Mark .
WHITACRE: Thanks for helping me remembe everything Bob . I sure appreciate it . I wish Brian could 've come .
HERNDON: He still pretty angry .
WHITACRE: You tell him , I 'm real sorry . Can you do that for me ? The funny part is if I 'd never gone undercover I would have never stolen 11 million . It was my way out . My severance . What else could I do I wrote my own severance . Draft 1/15/03 153 .
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER: Work detail .
WHITACRE: I got ta go , Bob . Herndon does some math .
HERNDON: 11 million ? I thought it came out to nine .
WHITACRE: Did I say eleven ? Boy , it was only nine . Definitely . The eleven is with interest .
HERNDON: Mark , are you still taking you medication ?
WHITACRE: The doctor here says I do n't need it anymore . I can manage without it now that there 's less stress . It was just the stress of the FBI . Herndon turns to leave and then he pauses .
HERNDON: Mark , was it eleven ? I mean there is n't something else we need to
WHITACRE: I do n't know Bob , you tell me .
NEW OWNER: Mrs. Whitacre never told me anything about any hidden rooms and tunnels and neither did the ealtor .
GROCERY CASHIER: How would you like to pay for this ? Ginger opens her checkbook .
FARMER: Go back inside and shut the door .
FARMER: Julie , get me some water from the pump to wash up with , then get inside with your mother .
JULIE: Ready Pappa .
FARMER: Thank you darling , now go inside and take care of your mother . Do n't run .
NAZI OFFICER: This is the property of Perrier LaPadite ?
NAZI DRIVER: Yes heer Colonel .
OFFICER: Herman , until I summon you , I am to be left alone .
NAZI DRIVER: As you wish Heer Col .
NAZI OFFICER: Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite ?
FARMER: I am Perrier LaPadite .
NAZI OFFICER: It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieu LaPadite , I am Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S .
PERRIER: How may I help you ?
COL LANDA: I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion .
PERRIER: Colonel Landa , this is my family .
COL LANDA: Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame , at your service .
FARMERS WIFE: Do n't be ridiculous , heer Col .
COL LANDA: Monsieur LaPadite , the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true . Your wife is a beautiful woman .
CON' T: And each of your daughters is more lovely then the last .
PERRIER: Merci . Please have a seat .
COL LANDA: Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite , but no wine . This being a dairy farm one would e safe in assuming you have milk ?
CHARLOTTE: Oui .
COL LANDA: Then milk is what I prefer .
CHARLOTTE: Very Well .
COL LANDA: Monsieur , to both your family , and you cows , I say ; Bravo .
PERRIER: Merci .
COL LANDA: Please , join me at you table .
PERRIER: Very well .
COL LANDA: Monsieur LaPadite , what we have to discuss , ' would be better discussed in private . You 'll notice , I left my men outdoors- if it would n't offend them , could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside .
PERRIER: You are right .
COL LANDA: Monsieur LaPadite , I regret to inform you I 've exhausted the extent of my French . To continue to speak it so inadequately , would only serve to embarrass me . However , I 've been lead to believe you speak English quite well ?
PERRIER: Oui .
COL LANDA: Well , it just so happens , I do as well . This being your house , I ask you permission to switch to English , for the emainder of the conversation ?
PERRIER: By all means . They now speak ENGLISH ;
COL LANDA: Monsieur LaPadite , while I 'm very familiar with you , and your family . I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am . Are you aware of my existence ? The Farmer answers ;
PERRIER: Yes .
COL LANDA: This is good . Are you aware of the jo I 've been ordered to carry out in France ?
PERRIER: Yes . The Colonel drinks more milk .
COL LANDA: Please tell me what you 've heard ?
PERRIER: I 've heard , the fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding , or passing for Gentile . The S.S.Colonel smiles .
COL LANDA: The Fuhrer could n't of said it bette himself .
PERRIER: But the meaning of your visit , pleasant though it is , is mysterious to me . The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews , and found nothing .
COL LANDA: I 'm aware of that , I read the report on this area . But like any enterprise , when under new management , there 's always a slight duplication of efforts . Most of it being a complete waste of time , ut needs to be done nevertheless . I just have A few questions Monsieu LaPadite , if you can assist me with answers , my department can close the file on your family .
PERRIER: To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers . - Heer Colonel , would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe ? Looking up from his papers .
COL LANDA: Please , Monsieur LaPadite , it is you house , make yourself comfortable .
FARMER: What have you heard about The Dreyfusis Monsieur LaPadite ?
PERRIER: Only rumors -
COL LANDA: - I love rumors ! Facts can be so misleading , where rumors , true or false are often reveling . So Monsieur LaPadite , what rumors have you heard regarding The Dreyfusis ? The Farmerlooks at Landa .
PERRIER: Again , this is just a rumor - but we heard the Dreyfusis had made there way into Spain .
COL LANDA: So the rumors you 've heard have been of escape ?
PERRIER: Yes .
COL LANDA: Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis friendly ?
PERRIER: We were families in the same community , in the same bussiness . I would n't say we were friends , but members of the same community , we had common interest .
COL LANDA: Having never met the Dreyfusis , would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names ?
PERRIER: There were five of them . The father , Jacob .wife , Miram her brother , Bob
COL LANDA: - How old is Bob ?
PERRIER: Thirty - thirty one ?
COL LANDA: Continue .
PERRIER: And the children Amos and Shoshanna .
COL LANDA: Ages of the children ?
PERRIER: Amos - six - I believe . And Shosanna , was fifteen or sixteen , I 'm not really sure .
COL LANDA: Well I guess that should do it .
PERRIER: But of course .
COL LANDA: Monsieur LaPadite , are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me ?
PERRIER: I have no interest in such things .
COL LANDA: But you are aware of what they call me ?
PERRIER: I 'm aware .
COL LANDA: What are you aware of ?
PERRIER: That they call you , `` The Jew Hunter '' .
COL LANDA: Precisely ! Now I understand you trepidation in repeating it . Before he was assassinated , Heydrich apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him . Actually why he would hate the name , `` The Hangman '' , is baffling to me It would appear he did everything in his power to earn it . But I , on the other hand , love my unofficial title , precisely because I 've earned it .
CON'T: Negro 's - gorilla 's - brain - lips - smell - physical strength - penis size . But , if one were to determine what attributes the jews share with a beast , it would be that of the rat . Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda have said pretty much the same thing . Where our conclusions differ , is I do n't consider the comparison a insult . Consider for a moment , the world a rat lives in . It 's a hostile world indeed . If a rat were to scamper through you front door right now , would you greet it with hostility ?
PERRIER: I suppose I would .
COL LANDA: Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them ?
PERRIER: Rat 's spread disease , they bite people -
COL LANDA: - Unless some fool is stupid enough to try and handle a live one , rats do n't make it a practise of biting human beings . Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague , ut that was some time ago . In all you orn days , has a rat ever caused you to e sick a day in your life ? I purpose to you , any disease a rat could spread , a squirrel could equally carry . Yet I assume you do n't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with ats , do you ?
PERRIER: No .
COL LANDA: Yet , they are both rodent 's , are they not ? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail , while the othe has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin , they even rather look alike , do n't they ?
PERRIER: It is a interesting thought , eer Colonel .
COL LANDA: However , interesting as the thought may e , it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel . If a rat were to scampe through your door , this very minute , would you offer it a saucer of you delicious milk ?
PERRIER: Probably not .
COL LANDA: I did n't think so . You do n't like them . You do n't really know why you do n't like them . All you know is , you find them epulsive . ( let 's the
METAPHOR: sink in ) What a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure . Yet , not only does he survive , he thrives . And the reason fo this , is because our little foe has a instinct for survival and presavation second to none . And that Monsieur , is what a jew shares with a rat . Consequently , a German soldier , conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding jews . Where does the hawk look ? He looks in the barn , he looks in the attic , he looks in the cellar - he looks everywhere , he would hide . But there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide . However the reason the Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria , and placed me in French cow country today , is because it does occur to me . Because I 'm aware what tremendous feats human eings are capable of once they abandon dignity . May I smoke my pipe as well ?
PERRIER: Please , Cononel , make yourself at home .
COL LANDA: The other mistake the German soldie make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the Jews . These citizens are not enemies of the state . They are simply confused people , trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates . These citizens do not need punishing . They simply need to be reminded of thei duty in war time . Let 's use you as a example Monsieu LaPadite . In this war , you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself , your lovely ladies , or your cows - yet , here you are . So Monsieur LaPadite , let me purpose a question . In this time of war , what is your number one duty ? Is it to fight the Germans in the name of France to you last breath ? Or , is it to harass the occupying army to the best of you ability ? Or , is it to protect the poo unfortunate victims of warfare who can not protect themselfs ? Or , is your number one duty in this time of bloodshed , to protect those very eautiful women who constitute you family ? The Colonel lets the last statement stand .
PERRIER: To protect my family .
COL LANDA: Now , my job dictates , that I must have my men enter your home , and conduct a thorough search , before I can officially cross your families name off my list .
CON'T: And if there are any irregularities to be found , rest assured , they will be . That is unless , you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary .
PAUSE: I might add also , that any information that makes the preforming of My duty easier , will not be met with punishment . Actually quite the contrary , it will be met with reward . And that reward will be , your family will cease to be harassed in anyway , y the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country .
COL LANDA: You are sheltering enemies of the state , are you not ?
PERRIER: Yes .
COL LANDA: Your sheltering them underneath you floorboards are n't you ?
PERRIER: Yes .
COL LANDA: Point out to me the area 's where thei hiding .
PERRIER: Yes .
COL LANDA: I 'm going to switch back to french now , and I want you to follow my masquerade - is that clear ?
PERRIER: Yes .
COL LANDA: Monsieur LaPadite , I thank you for milk , and your hospitably . I do believe ou usiness here is done .
COL LANDA: It 's the girl . Nobody moves
LTHY BAREFEET: LAPPING against wet grass . Qt ! SHOSANNMA ' S FACE
SNOSANNA'S POV: the safety of tree 's , getting closer .
COL LANDA: Au revoir , Shosanna ! Till we meet again !
HOSANNA: Maces it to the woods , and is gone . T h e S.S . Colonel closes the window .
COL LANDA: Herman , I sense ` a question on your lips ? Out with it ?
DRIVER: Why did yoy allow a enemy of the state to escape ?
COL LANDA: Oh , I do n't think the state is in too much danger , do you ?
DRIVER: I suppose not .
COL LANDA: I 'm glad you see it my way . Besides , not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen year old girl , and allowing her to escape , our not nessessarlly the same thing . She 's a young girl , no food , no shelter , no shoes , who 's just witnessed the massacre of her entire family . She may not survive the night . And afte word spreads about what happened today , it 's highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid . If I had to guess her fate , I 'd say she 'll probably be turned in by some neighbour . Or , she 'll be spotted by some German soldier . Or , we 'll find her body in the woods , dead from starvation or exposure . Or , perhaps-she 'll survive . She will elude capture . She will escape to America . She will move to New York city . Where she will be elected , President of the United States .
LT.ALDO: My name is Lt.Aldo Raine , and I 'm puttin together a special team . And I need me eight soldiers . Eight - Jewish - American - soldiers . Now y'all might of heard rumors about the armada happening soon . Well , we 'll be leavin a little earlier . We 're gon na be dropped into France , dressed as civilians . And once we 're in enemy territory , as a bushwackin , guerrilla army , we 're gon na be doin one thing , and thing only , Killin Nazi 's . The Members of the National Socialist Party , have conquered Europe through murder , torture , intimidation , and terror . And that 's exactly what we 're gon na do to them . Now I do n't know out y'all ? But I sure as hell , didnt come down from the goddamn Smoky mountains , cross five thousand miles of water , fight my way through half Sicily , and then jump out of a fuckin air-o-plane , to teach the Nazi 's lessons in humanity . Nazi ai n't got no humanity . There the foot soldiers of a Jew hatin , mass murderin manic , and they need to be destroyed . That 's why any and every son-of-abitch we find wearin a Nazi uniform , there gon na die .
CON'T: We will be cruel to the Germans , and through our cruelty , they will know who we are . They will find the evidence of our cruelty , in the disembowed , dismembered , and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us . And the German will not be able to help themselves from imagining the cruelty thei others endured at our hands , and our boot heels , and the edge of ou knives . And the Germans , will be sickened by us . And the Germans , will talk about us . And the Germans , will fear us . And when the Germans close their eyes at night , and their sub conscious tortures them for the evil they 've done , it will be with thoughts of us , that it tortures them with . He stops pacing , and looks at everybody .
LT. ALDO: Sound good ? They all say ;
ALL: Yes , sir !
LT.ALDO: That 's what I like to hear . But I got a word of warning to all would-be warriors . When you join my command , you take on debit . A debit you owe me , personally . Every man under my command , owes me , one hundred nazi scalps . And I want my scalps . And all y'all will git me , one hundred Nazi scalps , taken from the heads of one hundred dead Nazi 's .or you will die trying .
HITLER: How much more of these jew swine must I endure ? They butcher my men like they were fish bait ! This pack of filthy degenerates , are doing what the Russian army did n't , and Patton 's army could n't . Turning soldiers of The Third Reich , into superstitious old women !
GERMAN GENERAL: Just the cowards among them mine Fuhrer .
HITLER: No , no , no , no , no , no ! I have heard the rumors myself ! Solders of The Third Reich , who have brought the world to there knee ` s , now pecking and clucking like chickens . Do you know the latest umor they 've conjured up , in their fea induced delirium ? The one that beats my boys with a bat . The one they call `` The Bear Jew '' is a Golem . A avenging jew angel , conjured up by a vengeful rabbi , to smite the Aryans !
GENERAL: Mine Fuhrer , this is just soldiers gossip , no one really believes The Bear Jew is a golem .
HITLER: Why not ? They seem to be able to elude capture like a aberration . They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will .
CON'T: You want to prove their flesh and lood ? Then BRING THEM TO ME ! I will hang them naked , by thei heels , from the eiffel tower ! And then throw their bodies in the sewers , for the rats of Paris to feast !
DISGUSTED: The Bear Jew .
KLIEST1: KLIEST VOICE comes out of the intercom ;
HITLER: I have a order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France . The Jew degenerate known as The Bea Jew , hence forth , is never to be eferred to as The Bear Jew again . We will cease to aid the Americans any longer in there attempt to undermine the German soldier psyche . Did you get that Kliest ?
PVT.BUTZ VO: Werner and I were the only ones left alive after the ambush . While one man guarded us , the rest removed the hair . All The Basterds wore German scalps tied to their belts .
CU SCALPS: hanging from belts .
PVT.BUTZ VO: They not only took valuables
PFC.UTIVICH: Sigfried Muller .
PVT.BUTZ VO: .and tore out the identification page .
SOCKS: removed , reveling dead bare feet
BASTERDS: tossing the boots off a hill .
PVT.BUTZ VO: Throwing them away from the bodies
PVT.BUTZ VO: The Basterds , took their lives , thei hair , their valuables , their identity , and finally their dignity in death .
HITLER: The dogsl He fights his frustration , then
LT.ALDO: Hey Hirschberg , send that kraut sarge over .
BASTERD PFC.HIRSCHBERG: KICKS Sgt.Rachtman in the back .
PFC.HIRSCHBERG: You ! Go !
NARRATOR VO: Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many interrogations since Germany decided it should rule Europe . But this is the first time he 's ever been on the wrong end of the exchange . It 's always been his belief , only a weakling , in mind , body , and spirt complies with the enemy under threat of consequence . As Werner watched men cry like women , pleadingly offer their knowledge , in exchange for their worthless lives , he made a vow to himself . If his role is to die in this conflict . When they put him under the earth , his dignity would be buried with him . For in the other world , the gods only espect the ones they test first . Well Sgt , this is your test . And the gods are watching .
ENGLISH: Sgt.Werner Rachtman . Aldo returns the salute , looking up at him .
LT.ALDO: Lt.Aldo Raine , pleased to meet cha . You know what sit down means Werner ?
SGT.RACHTMAN: Yes .

LT.ALDO: Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz ? Hugo nods .
LT. ALDO: I 'm Lt.Aldo Raine , and these are The Basterds . Ever heard of us ? Hugo nods his head , yes .
LT.ALDO: We just wan na say , we 're a big fan of your work . When it comes to killin Nazi 's , I think you show great talent , and I pride myself on havin a eye fo that kind of talent . But your status as a Nazi killer , is still amateur . We all came here to see , if you wan na go pro ?
SGT.RACHTMAN: Aldo the Apache . The circle of Basterds giggle .
LT.ALDO: Well Werner , if you heard of us , you probably heard , we ai n't in the prisoner takin business . We in the killin Nazi business . And cousin , usiness is boomin . The Basterds laugh .
LT. ALDO: Now that leaves two ways we can play this out . Either kill ya , or let ya go . Now weather or not you gon na leave this circle alive , depends entirely on you .
LT.ALDO: Up the road a piece , there 's a orchard . 'sides you , we know there 's another kraut patrol fuckin around here somewhere .

Now if you ever wan na eat a sauerkraut sandwich again , you got ta show me on this map , where they are , you got ta tell me how many they are , and you got ta tell me , what kinda artillery they carrying with 'em ?
SGT.RACHTMAN: You ca n't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger ?
LT.ALDO: well , Werner that 's where your wrong . Because that 's exactly what I expect . I need to know about Germans hidin in trees ? And you need to tell me ? And you need to tell me , right now ? Now take your finger , and point out on this map , where this partys bein held , how manys comin , and what they ought to play with ?
SGT.WERNER: F I respectfully refuse , sir . Aldo jerks his thumb behind him .
LT.ALDO: You see that ole boy battin rocks ?
SGT.RACHTMAN: I heard .
LT.ALDO: What did you hear ?
SGT.RACHTMAN: He beats German soldiers with a club .
LT.ALDO: He bashes their brains in with a aseball bat , what he does .
LT. ALDO: Now Werner , I 'm gon na ask you one last-goddamn-time , and if you still , `` respectfully refuse '' , I 'm callin The Bear Jew over here , and he 's gon na take that big bat of his , and he 's gon na eat your ass to death with it .

SGT.DONNY DONOWITZ: Bat over his shoulder , smiles .
DONNY: .ya got the goddamn fuckin Germans , declaring open season on Jews in Europe , and I 'm suppose to fly to the fuckin Philippines , and fight a bunch of fuckin Japs - not me pal . If we just go in this against the Japs , the whole U.S.of fuckin A can go take a unning jump at the moon .
HEAD: You know they got a word for what you sayin Donny , it 's called treason .
DONNY: Hey , stick your treason up your poop hole . If I 'm gon na kill my fellow man in the name of liberty , that fellow man , will be German .

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN: If you like tea .
DONNY: Mrs.Himmelstein , do you have any love ones over in Europe who your concerned for ?

DONNY: Because I 'm going to Europe . And I 'm gon na make it right .
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN: And just how do intend to do that , Joshua ?
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN: And what exactly do you intend to do with that toy ?
DONNY: I 'm gon na beat every Nazi I find to death with it .
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN: I thought we were having tea together ?
DONNY: I 'm going through the neighbourhood . If you have any love ones in Europe , who 's safety you fear for , I 'd like you to write their name on my bat .
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN: You must be a real BASTERD , Donny ?
DONNY: You bet your sweet ass I am .
MRS.HIMMELSTEIN: Good . A Basterds work is never done . Specially in Germany .

LT.ALDO: You wan na live ?
PVT.BUTZ: Yes , sir .
LT.ALDO: Point out on this map , the German position .
PVT.BUTZ: This area here .
LT.ALDO: How many ?
PVT.BUTZ: Maybe twelve .
LT.ALDO: What kinda of artillery ?
PVT.BUTZ: They have a machine gunn dug in here pointing north .
HITLER: How did you survived this ordel ?
PRVT.BUTZ: They let me go .
LT.ALDO: Now when you report what happened here , you ca n't tell 'em , you told us , what you told us . They 'll shoot ya . But there gon na wan na know , why you so special , we let you live ? So tell 'em , we let ya live , so you could spread the word through the ranks , what 's gon na happen to every Nazi we find .
HITLER: You are not to tell anybody anything ! Not one word of detail ! Your outfit was ambushed , and you got a away . Not one word more .
PVT.BUTZ: Yes mine Fuhrer .
HITLER: Did they mark you like they did the other survivors ?
PVT.BUTZ: Yes mine Fuhrer .
HITLER: Remove your hat and show me .
LT.ALDO: Now say we let ya go , and say you survive the'war ? When you get back home , what'eha gon na do ?
PVT.BUTZ: I will hug my mother like I 've neve hugged her before .
LT.ALDO: Well , ai n't that 's a real nice boy . Are you going to take off your uniform ?
PVT.BUTZ: Not only shall I remove it , but I intend to burn it !
LT. ALDO: Yeah , that 's what we thought . We do n't like that . You see , we like our Nazi 's in uniforms . That way , you can spot 'em , just like that . But you take off that uniform , ai n't nobody gon na know you was a Nazi . And that do n't sit well with us .
LT.ALDO: So I 'm gon na give ya a little somethin , you ca n't take off .
SGT.DONOWITZ: You know Lieutenant , your getting pretty good at that .
LT. ALDO: You know how you get to Carnegie Hall , do n't 'ch ? Practice .
MADAME MIMIEUX: So young woman , since it 's beyond obvious we 're closed for the evening . I must assume you want something . What can I do for you ?
SHOSANNA: May I sleep here tonight ?
MADAME MIMIEUX: So I gather your not a nurse ?
SHOSANNA: No .
MADAME MIMIEUX: But your a bright little thing , that 's clever disguise . Where is your family ?
SHOSANNA: Murdered .
MADAME MIMIEUX: So your a war orphan ?
SHOSANNA: We were from Nancy . The Bosch found us
MADAME MIMIEUX: Is this a sad story ?
SHOSANNA: Oui .
MADAME MIMIEUX: Sad stories bore me . These days everyone in Paris has one . I have n't bore you with mine , do n't bore me with yours .
SHOSANNA: You can run the machines ?
MADAME MIMIEUX: What machines ?
SHOSANNA: The machines that show the film ?
MADAME MIMIEUX: The projectors ? Yes , I own a cinema , of course I can operate them .
SHOSANNA: I know , I saw you .
MADAME MIMIEUX: expertly working the projectors
SHOSANNA: Teach me . Teach me to run the machines , that show the film . It 's only you and the negro . I know you could use some help .
MADAME MIMIEUX: I know at least six people who 've been put up against a wall , and machine gunned for sheltering enemies of the state . I have no intention of being unlucky number seven . How long have you been in Paris ?
SHOSANNA: A week , and a few days .
MADAME MIMIEUX: How have you survived the curfew without capture ?
SHOSANNA: I sleep on rooftops .
MADAME MIMIEUX: Again , I 'm forced to admit , cleve girl . How is it ?
SHOSANNA: Cold .
LAUGHS: I can imagine .
SHOSANNA: Respectfully , no you ca n't .
MADAME MIMIEUX: Fair enough .
SHOSANNA: Oui .
MADAME MIMIEUX: Whats your name ?
SHOSANNA: Shosanna .
MADAME MIMIEUX: I 'm Madame Mimieux . You may call me Madame . This is a cinema . Not a home for wayward war orphans . Having said that , what you say is true . If you were truly exceptional , I could find use for you . So Shosanna , are you truly exceptional ?
SHOSANNA: Oui Madame .
MADAME MIMIEUX: I will be the judge of that .
NARRATOR VO: To operate a cinema in Paris during the occupation , one had two choices . Ether you could show new German propaganda films , produced under the watchful eye of Joseph Goebbels . Or .you could have a German night in you weekly schedule , and show allowed German classic films . Their German night was Thursday .
GERMAN SOLDIER: What starts tomorrow ?
SHOSANNA: A Max Linder festival .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Ummmm , I always preferred Linder to Chaplin . Except Linder never made a film as good as `` The Rid '' . The chase climax of `` The Kid '' , superb .
SHOSANNA: No need , I can manage .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Do n't be ridiculous , it 's my pleasure .
SHOSANNA: Merci .
GERMAN SOLDIER: I adore your cinema very much .
SHOSANNA: Merci .
GERMAN SOLDIER: How does a young girl , such as yourself , own a cinema ?
SHOSANNA: My aunt left it to me .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Lucky girl . Shosanna makes no reply back .
SHOSANNA: I do n't have a choice , but your welcome .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Do you chose the German films yourself ?
SHOSANNA: Oui .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Then my merci stands . I love the Refensthal mountain films , especially , `` Pizu Palu '' . It 's nice to see a French girl who 's a admirer of Refensthal .
SHOSANNA: `` Admire '' , would not be the adjective I would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal .
GERMAN SOLDIER: But you do admire the director . Pabst , do n't you ? That 's why you included his name on the marquee .
SHOSANNA: I 'm French . We respect directors in our country .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Apparently even Germans .
SHOSANNA: Even Germans . Merci for assistance , Private . Adieu . She turns to go back inside .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Your not finished ?
SHOSANNA: I 'll finish in the morning . She opens the door to go inside .
GERMAN SOLDIER: May I ask your name ?
SHOSANNA: You wish to see my papers ? She hands him her excellently forged papers .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Emmanuelle Mimieux . That 's a very pretty name .
SHOSANNA: Merci . Are you finished with my papers ? He hands them back .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Mademoiselle . My name is Fredrick Zoller . She gives no response .
MADAME MIMIEUX: if I ever see you light up a cigarette in my cinema again , I 'll turn you into the Nazi 's , do you understand ? Shosanna is shocked by this statement .
SHOSANNA: Oui , Madame .
MADAME MIMIEUX: And for bringing a open flame in my cinema , you deserve far worse then a Nazi jewish boxcar . With your thick head , what do you think the highest priority of a cinema manager is ? Keeping this fucking place from burning down to the ground , that 's what ! In my collection , I have over 350 , 35mm , nitrate film prints , which are not only immensely flammable , but highly unstable . And should they catch fire , they burn three times faster then paper . If that happens.. .POOFall gone , cinema no more , every body burned alive . If I eve see you with a open flame in my cinema again , I wo n't turn you into the Nazi 's I 'll kill you myself . And the fucking Germans will give me a curfew pass . Do you understand me ?
SHOSANNA: Out , Madame .
MADAME MIMIEUX: Do you believe me ?
SHOSANNA: Out , Madame .
MADAME MIMIEUX: You damn well better .
MARCEL: Are you well ?
SHOSANNA: Even on the roof I ca n't smoke a cigarette without hearing Madames voice yelling at me . That 's why I do it . To hear Madames voice again .
MARCEL: We both miss her .
SHOSANNA: I know . I 'm fine , darling . I 'll be to bed soon . Marcel goes back inside , Shosanna smokes .
FREDRICK: May I join you ?
SHOSANNA: Look Fredrick -
SMILING: - You remember my name ?
SHOSANNA: Yes.Look , you seem a pleasant enough fellow -
FREDRICK: - Merci .
SHOSANNA: Your welcome . - regardless , I want you to stop pestering me .
FREDRICK: I apologize mademoiselle , I was n't trying to be a pest . I was simply trying to be friendly .
SHOSANNA: I do n't wish to be your friend .
FREDRICK: Why not ?
SHOSANNA: Do n't act like a infant . You know why .
FREDRICK: I 'm more then just a uniform .
SHOSANNA: Not to me . If you are so desperate fo a French girlfriend , I suggest you try Vichy ?
FREDRICK: I thought I was just a uniform ?
SHOSANNA: Your not just a German soldier , are you somebodies son ?
FREDRICK: Most German soldiers are somebodies son .
SHOSANNA: Yeah , but your not just somebody . What are you , Hitlers nephew ?
FREDRICK: Yes .
SHOSANNA: Really ?
FREDRICK: No not really , I 'm just teasing you . She leans back annoyed .
SHOSANNA: Then what is it ? What are you , a German movie star ?
FREDRICK: Not exactly .
SHOSANNA: , what does that mean , `` not exactly '' . I asked if you were a movie star , the answer to that question , is yes or no . Fredrick laughs at that line .
FREDRICR: When you said that just now , you eminded me of my sister . This catches young Shosanna off guard .
SHOSANNA: You were raised by Helga ?
FREDRICK: All my sisters , I 'm the baby , but Helga was the bossiest .
SHOSANNA: And your mother and father ?
FREDRICK: My mother died . And my father was a loser . My fathers moto ; `` If at first you do n't succeed , quit '' . The day he left , good riddance . My sisters are all I need . It 's why I like your cinema . It makes me feel both closer to them , and a little homesick at the same time .
SHOSANNA: is your cinema still operatiing ?
FREDRICR: Oui .
SHOSANNA: What 's it called ?
FREDRICK: The Kino Haus .
SHOSANNA: How has it done durring the war ?
FREDRICK: Actually , in Germany , cinema attendance is up .
SHOSANNA: No doubt , you do n't have to operate under a curfew .
FREDRICK: How often do you fill your house ?
SHOSANNA: , not since before the war .
FREDRICK: So if you had one big engagement , that would help you out ?
SHOSANNA: Of course , but that 's not likely to happen .
FREDRICK: Everybody knows that , I liked you did n't .
SHOSANNA: What did you do ? He takes a sip of beer .
FREDRICK: I 've shot the most enemy soldiers in world war twoso far .
SHOSANNA: Wow .
FREDRICK: I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in Russia . It was myself , and a thousand rounds of ammo , in a bird 's nest , against three hundred Soviet soldiers .
SHOSANNA: What 's a bird 's nest ?
FREDRICK: A bird 's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower . It 's a high structure , offering a three hundred and sixty degree view . Very advantageous for marksmen .
SHOSANNA: How many Russian 's did you kill ?
FREDRICK: Sixty-eight .
BEAT: The first day . A hundred and fifty the second day . Thirty-two , the third day . On the forth day , they exited the city . Naturally my war story received alot of attention in Germany , that 's why they all recognize me . They call me the German Sgt.York .
SHOSANNA: Maybe they 'll make a film about your exploits .
FREDRICK: Well , that 's just what Joseph Goebbels thought . So he did . It 's called `` Nation 's Pride '' , and guess what , they wanted me to play myself , so I did . They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris . That 's another reason for all the attention .
SHOSANNA: `` Nation 's Pride '' is about you ? `` Nation 's Pride '' is starring you ?
FREDRICK: I know , comical , huh ?
SHOSANNA: Not so comical . So what are you doing in Paris , enjoying a rest ?
FREDRICK: Hardly . I 've been doing publicity , having my picture taken with different German luminaries , visiting troops , that sort of thing . Goebbels wants the film to premier in Paris , so I 've been helping them in the planning . Joseph is very keen on this film . He 's telling anybody who will listen , when `` Nation 's Pride '' is released , I 'll be the German Van Johnson .
SHOSANNA: Well , good luck with your premie Private . I hope all goes well fo Joseph and yourself . Au revoir .
GESTAPO MAJOR: Mademoiselle Nimieux ?
SHOSANNA: Oui ?
GESTAPO MAJOR: Ask her if this is her cinema ? in French The Driver asks Shosanna ;
DRIVER: is this your cinema ?
GESTAPO MAJOR: Tell her to come down .
DRIVER: Come down please . She climbs down the ladder .
SHOSANNA: I do n't understand , what have I done ?
DRIVER: She wants to know what she 's done ?
GESTAPO MAJOR: Who says she 's done anything ?
DRIVER: Who says you 've done anything ?
SHOSANNA: Then I demand to know what this is about , and where do you propose to take me ?
GESTAPO MAJOR: Get your ass in that car .
GOEBBELS: - it 's only the off spring of slaves that
FREDRICK: Good you came . I was n't sure weather o not you 'd except my invitation .
SHOSANNA: Invitation ?
GOEBBLES OS: Is that the young lady in question , Fredrick ?
FREDRICK: Yes it is , beer Goebbels . Emmanuelle , there is somebody I want you to meet .
GOEBBELS: Your reputation precedes you Fraulein Mimieux .
FREDRICK: And normally , this is beer Goebbels French interpreter , Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino .
FRANCESCA: looks up at Shosanna .
SHOSANNA: Bon jour .
FREDRICK: And you 've met the Major .
GESTAPO MAJOR: Actually , I did n't introduce myself . Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo , at your service mademoiselle . Please allow me , have a seat .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Try the wine mademoiselle , it 's quite good . Goebbels looks across the table at her .
GOEBBELS: well I must say , you 've made quite a impression on our boy .
FREDRICK: - Heer Goebbels , I have n't informed her yet .
GOEBBELS: Unless the girls a simpleton , I 'm sure she 's figured it out by now , after all she does operate a cinema . Francesca , tell her . Francesca tells Shosanna in French ;
FRANCESCA: What they 're trying to tell you Emmanuelle , is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch , trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zollers film premier , and change the venue to your cinema . Zoller reacts .
FRENCH: to Zoller ) What ?
FREDRICK: I wanted to inform her .
FRANCESCA: Shit . I apologize Private , of course you did .
GERMAN: to Francesca ) What 's the issue ?
FRANCESCA: The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself .
GOEBBELS: Nonsense . Until I ask a few questions , he has nothing to inform . Let the record state , I have not agreed to a venue change .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Duly noted . Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna ;
GOEBBELS: You have opera boxes ?
GOEBBELS: More would be better . How many seats in your auditorium ?
SHOSANNA: Three hundred and fifty .
GOEBBELS: That 's almost four hundred less then The Ritz . Fredrick jumps in
FREDRICK: But beer Goebbels , that 's not such a terrible thing . You said yourself you did n't want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor . With less seat 's it makes the event more exclusive . Your not trying to fill the house , their fightin g for seats .
CON'T: Besides , to hell with the French . This is a German night , a German event , a German celebration . This night is for you , me , the German military , the high command , thei family and friends . The only people who should be allowed in the room , are people who will be moved by the exploits on screen .
GOEBBELS: I see your public speaking has improved . It appears I 've created a monster . A strangely persuasive monster . When the war 's over , politics awaits . Table chuckles .
SHOSANNA: My cinema , on German night , tends to show older German classics . Francesca interprets
GOEBBELS: Why not my films ? Francesca asks
SHOSANNA: I draw a older German audience in my cinema , that appreciate the nostalgia of the earlier time . Francesca interprets
GOEBBELS: That 's nonsense fraulein . Us Germans are looking forward , not backwards . That era of German cinema is dead . The German cinema I create , will not only be thee cinema of Europe . But the worlds only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of Hollywood . Fredrick Jumps in
FREDRICK: Along with being a cinema owner , Emmanuelle is quite a formidable film critic . He chuckles , but alone .
GOEBBELS: WSo it would appear . Unfortunately for the fraulein , I 've outlawed film criticism . Zoller , thinking fast , says ;
FREDRICK: Why do n't you screen `` Lucky Kids '' ? I 'm sure Emmanuelle has n't seen . it . And it 's so funny , I 've been meaning to recommend it to her , for he German night . That 's a great idea , let 's watch `` Lucky Kids '' tonight .
GOEBBELS: Ahhh , `` Lucky Kids '' , `` Lucky Kids '' , `` Lucky Kids '' . When all is said and done , my most purely enjoyable production . Not only that , I would n't be surprised , if sixty years from now , It 's `` Lucky Kids '' that I 'm the most remembered for . I know it does n't seem like it now , ut mark my words . Very well , I 'll have a print sent over to the fraulein'.s cinema . We 'll screen `` Lucky Kids '' tonight .
FREDRICK: Shosanna , this4pol Hans Landa of the SS. , he 'll be running security for the premier .
COL LANDA: Charmed Mademoiselle .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Better known as `` The Jew Hunter '' . The table laughs .
GOEBBELS: Oh Francesca , what was that funny thing the Fuhrer said about Hans ?
FRANCESCA: What thing ?
GOEBBELS: You know , you were there , it was a funny thing the Fuhrer said , about HansSomething about a pig ? Francesca 's memory is jogged .
FRANCESCA: Oh , yes of course .
GOEBBELS: Oh , yes of course , that 's it . So the Fuhrer said , he would n't be surprised if Hans were n't rooting out Jews like a truffle pig from the play pen .
FRANCESCA: That 's what we need , pigs that can oot out Jews .
COL LANDA: Who needs pigs when you have me ? Big hearty laugh around the table .
GOEBBELS: Do you have a engagement tonight ?
COL LANDA: Well , as a matter of fact , I do -
GOEBBELS: - Break it . We 're all going to the Fraulein 's cinema tonight to view `` Lucky Kids '' .
COL LANDA: Splendid .
FRANCESCA: And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment .
GOEBBELS: Slave driver ! French slave driver ! They all chuckle .
COL LANDA: Actually , in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion , I 'm afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux .
FREDRICK: What sort of discussion ?
COL LANDA: That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel ? Or am I just being sensitive ?
FREDRICK: Nothing could be further from the truth Colonel . Your authority is eyond question . But your reputation does proceed you . Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned ?
GOEBBELS: Hans , the boy means no harm , he 's simply smitten . And he 's correct . Your reputation does proceed you .
COL LANDA: No need for concern , you two . As security chief , I simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue 's property owner .
FREDRICK: I was just hoping to escort Mademoiselle Mimieux back to he cinema .
GOEBBELS: Nonsense ! You can eat ice cream , and walk along the Sienne anothe time . Right now , allow Col Landa to do his job . Everybody saystheir farewells .
COL LANDA: Have you tried the strudel here ?
SHOSANNA: No .
COL LANDA: It 's not so terrible . So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted ?
ANXIOUSLY: Up untill a couple of days ago , I had no knowledge of Private Zoller , or his exploits . To me , the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema . We spoke a few times , but -
COL LANDA: - Mademoiselle , let me interrupt you . This is a simple formality , no eason for you to feel anxious .
WAITER: One moment . He exits .
COL LANDA: Wait for the cream . ( Back to
BUSINESS: So Emmanuelle - May I call you Emmanuelle ?
SHOSANNA: Oui .
COL LANDA: So Emmanuelle , explain to me how does it happen , that a young lady such as your self , comes to own a cinema ?
MOUTHFULL: of pie ) Success ?
.COL LANDA: Like I said , not so terrible . ( Back to
BUSINESS: So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership ?
SHOSANNA: The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle -
COL LANDA: - What is there names ?
SHOSANNA: Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux . He records the names in his little book .
COL LANDA: Where are they now ?
SHOSANNA: My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg .
COL LANDA: Pity . Continue .
SHOSANNA: Aunt Ada passed away from feve last spring . '
COL LANDA: Regrettable .
PAUSE: It 's come to my attention you have a negro in your employ , is that true ?
SHOSANNA: Yes , he 's a Frenchman . His name is Marcel . He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema . He 's the only other one who works with me .
COL LANDA: Doing what ?
SHOSANNA: Projectionist .
COL LANDA: Is he any good ?
SHOSANNA: The best .
COL LANDA: Actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them . Can you operate the projectors ?
SHOSANNA: Of course I can .
COL LANDA: Knowing the Reich Minister as I do , I 'm quite positive he would n't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening , dependent on the prowess of a negro . So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue , talented no doubt , as your negro may be , you will operate the projectors . Is that exceptable ? As if she has any say .
SHOSANNA: Oui .
COL LANDA: So it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you ?
SHOSANNA: Private Zollers feelings for me are n't of a romantic nature .
COL LANDA: Mademoiselle ?
SHOSANNA: Colonel , his feelings are not omantic . I remind him of his sister .
COL LANDA: That does n't mean his feelings are n't romantic .
SHOSANNA: I remind him of his sister who aised him .
COL LANDA: It 's sounding more and more romantic y the minute .
SHOSANNA: No thank you .
COL LANDA: Do you smoke ?
SHOSANNA: Yes .
COL LANDA: Then I insist , you must take one . There not French , there German . I hope your not nationalist about your tobacco , to me French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine . She takes one , but makes no move to light it . He inhales deep , and says ;
CU SHOSANNA: watching the screen .
SILVER SCREEN: `` The END '' card for `` Lucky Kids '' is projected .
IZ: The lights go up .
NARRATOR VO: The screening of `` Lucky Kids '' was a complete success . And Heer Goebbels conceded to have the venue changed to Shosannas cinema . Not only that , in a moment of inspiration , Hee Goebbels had a idea .
GOEBBELS: I must say , I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium . Your Cinema has real respect , almost church like . Not to say we could n't spruce the place up a bit . In Versailles there 's a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary . we 're going to get it , and hang it from the very middle of auditorium roof . Also I want to go to Louvre , pick up a few Greek nudes , and just scatter them about the lobby .
MARCEL: What the fuck are we suppose to do ?
SHOSANNA: It looks like we 're suppose to have a Nazi premier .
MARCEL: Like I said , what the fuck are we suppose to do ?
SHOSANNA: Well , I need to speak with you about that .
MARCEL: About what ?
SHOSANNA: About these Hun swine , commandeering our cinema .
MARCEL: What about it ?
SHOSANNA: Well , when I was watching the bosch ( Said in
ENGLISH: Capra-corn abomination , ( Back to
FRENCH: I got a idea .
MARCEL: I 'm confused , what are we talking about ?
SHOSANNA: Filling the cinema with Nazi 's and their whores , and burning it down to the ground .
MARCEL: I 'm not talking about that , you talking about that .
SHOSANNA: No , we 're talking about that , ight now . If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves , we can burn it down y ourselves .
MARCEL: Shosanna -
SHOSANNA: No , Marcel , just for sake of argument , if we wanted to burn down the cinema , for any number of reasons , you and I could physically accomplish that , no ?
MARCEL: Oui Shosanna , we could do that .
SHOSANNA: And with Madame Mimieux 's 350 nitrate film print collection , we would n't even need explosives , would we ?
MARCEL: You mean we would n't need any more explosives ?
SHOSANNA: Oui , that 's exactly what I mean . She begins kissing his hands .
CON'T: I am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night . One of his fingers probes her mouth .
CON'T: And if I 'm going to burn down the cinema , which I am , we both know , your not going to let me do it y myself .
CON'T: Because you love me . And I love you . And your the only person on this earth I can trust .
CON'T: But that 's not all we 're going to do . Does the filmmaking equipment it the attic still work ? I know the film camera does . How about the sound ecorder ?
MARCEL: Quite well , actually . I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week . It works superb . Why do we need filmmaking equipment ?
SHOSANNA: Because Marcel , my sweet , we 're going to make a film . Just for the Nazi 's .
MILITARY ATTACHE: Right this way , Lieutenant .
LT. HICOX: Lt. Archie Hicox , reporting sir .
GEN FENECH: General Ed Fenech , at ease Hicox . Drink ?
LT.HICOX: if you offered me a scotch and plane water , I could drink a scotch and plain water .
GEN.FENECH: That a boy , Lieutenant . Make it yourself , like a good chap , will you ? Bars in the globe . Hicox heads over to the bar globe .
LT.HICOX: Something for yourself , sir ?
GEN.FENECH: Whiskey straight . No junk in it .
LT.HICOX: Extraordinary people , the Norwegian 's .
GEN.FENECH: It says here you speak German fluently ?
LT.HICOX: Like a Katzenjammer Kid .
GEN.FENECH: And your occupation before the war ? His back still to us , as he bartends
LT.HICOX: Well sir , such as they are , I write eviews and articles , for a publication called ; `` Films and Filmmakers '' . As well as our sister publication .
GEN.FENECH: What 's that called ?
LT.HICOX: `` Flickers Bi-Monthly '' . And I 've had two books published .
GEN.FENECH: Impressive . Do n't be modest Lieutenant , what are their titles ?
LT.HICOX: `` Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci '' . It 's a subtexual film criticism study of the work of German directo G.W . Pabst .
GEN.FENECH: Down with Hitler .
LT.HICOX: All the way down , sir .
GEN.FENECH: Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich ?
LT.HICOX: Pardon sir ?
GEN.FENECH: This little escapade of ours , equires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich . Explain to me UFA , under Goebbels ?
LT.HICOX: Goebbels considers the films he 's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema . A alternative to what he considers the Jewish German intellectual cinema of the twenties . And the Jewish controlled dogma of Hollywood .
CHURCHELL: How 's he doing ?
LT.HICOX: Quite well , actually . Since Goebbels has taken over , film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years . But Louis B.Maye would n't be Goebbels proper opposite number . I believe Goebbels see 's himself closer to David O.Selznick . Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister . With a puff of cigar smoke , Churchell says ;
CHURCHELL: Brief him .
GEM.FENECH: Lt.Bicox , at this point in time I 'd like to brief you on , Operation Kino . Three days from now , Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premier of one of his new movies in Paris -
LT.HICOX: - What film sir ?
GEN.FENECH: The motion pictures called ; `` Nation 's Pride '' .
LT.HICOX: Oh , you mean the film about Private Zoller ?
GEN.FENECH: We do n't have any intelligence , on exactly , what the film that night will be about .
LT.HICOX: But it 's called `` Nation 's Pride '' ?
GEN.FENECH: Yes .
LT.HICOX: I can tell you what it 's about , it 's about Private Fredrick Zoller . He 's the German Sgt.York .
GEN.FENECH: In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion , will be Goebbels , Gerring , Boorman , and most of the German High command , including all high ranking officers of both The S.S. , and , The Gestapo . As well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry .
LT.HICOX: The master race at play , aye ?
GEN.FENECH: Basically , we have all our rotten eggs in one basket . The objective of Operation Kino . Blow up the basket .
LT.HICOX: `` and like the snows of yesteryear , gone from this earth '' . Jolly good , sir .
GEN.FENECH: An American Secret Service outfit , that lives deep behind enemy lines , will be your assist . The Germans call them ; `` The Basterds '' .
LT.HICOX: `` The Basterds '' , never heard of them .
GEN.FENECH: Whole point of the secret service , old boy , you not hearing of them . But the Gerrys have heard of them , ecause these yanks have been them the devil . Their leader is a chap named Lt.Aldo Raine . The Germans call him , `` Aldo the Apache '' .
LT.HICOX: Why do they call him that ?
GEN.FENECH: Best guess , is because he removes the scalps of the Nazi dead .
LT.HICOX: Scalps , sir ?
GEN.FENECH: The hair . He runs his finger along his hairline .
LT.HICOX: Rather gruesome sounding little Dicky bird , is n't he ?
GEN.FENECH: No doubt the whole lot , a bunch a nutters . But you 've heard the expression , `` It takes a thief '' .
LT.HICOX: Indeed .
GEN.FENECH: You 'll be dropped into France , about twenty four kilometers outside of Paris . The Basterds will be waiting for you . First thing , you go to a little village called , `` Nadine '' . Apparently the Gerrys never go there . In Nadine , there 's a tavern , called , `` La Louisiane '' , you 'll rendez-vous with our double agent , and she 'll take it from there . She 's the one who 's going to get you in the premiere . It will be you , her , and two German orn members of the Basterds . She 's also made all the other arrangements your going to need .
LT.HICOX: How will I know her ?
GEN.FENECH: I suspect that wo n't be too much trouble for you . Your contact is Bridget Von Hammersmark .
LT.HICOX: Bridget Von Hammersmark ? The German movie star is working for England ?
GEN.FENECH: For the last two years now . one could even say Operation Kino was he ainchild . In the back of the room the bulldog barks ;
CHURCHELL: Extraordinary women .
LT.BICOX: Quite .
GEN.FENECH: You 'll go to the premiere as he escort , lucky devil . She 'll also have the premiere tickets for the other two . Got the gist ?
LT.HICOX: I think so , sir . Paris when it sizzles . The three British bulldogs laugh .
MARCEL: We need a sync mark .
SHOSANNA: What is a sync mark ?
MARCEL: A action and noise put together , So we can sync up the picture and sound .
SHOSANNA: How do we do that ?
MARCEL: Clap your hands . She does .
SHOSANNA: Ready .
MARCEL: Action .
MARCEL: But how do we get it developed ? Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage . How do we get a35mm print with a soundtrack ?
SHOSANNA: Do you know one person who can do oth things ?
MARCEL: Of course Gaspar , very nice man , took care of all the experimental filmmakers . But nobody in thei ight mind would strike a print of what your talking about . If the Nazi 's found out , their life would n't e worth this . He snaps his fingers .
SHOSANNA: In a wolf fight , you ether eat the wolf , or the wolf eats you . If we 're going to obliterate the Nazi 's , we have to use their tactics .
MARCEL: What does that mean ?
SHOSANNA: We find somebody who can develop and process a35mm print . And we make them do it , or we kill them . Once we tell them what we want to do , if they refuse , we have to kill them anyway , or they 'll turn us in .
MARCEL: Would you do that ?
SHOSANNA: Like that . Snaps her fingers .
SHOSANNA: Bring that fucker over here ! Put his head down on that table .
GASPAR: I 'm not a collaborator !
SHOSANNA: Then prove it ! Or does your manhood go no deeper , then standing to piss ? Marcel , does his wife , and children know you ?
MARCEL: Oui .
SHOSANNA: Then after we kill this dog fo Germans , we 'll go and silence them . She lifts up the hatchet , raises it high
NADINE, FRANCE": TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
LT.ALDO: You did n't say the goddamn rendez-vous was in a fuckin basement .
LT.HICOX: I did n't know .
LT.ALDO: You said it was in a tavern ?
LT.HICOX: it is a tavern .
LT.ALDO: Yeah , in a basement . You know , fightin in a basement offers a lot of difficulties , number one being , your fighting in a basement .
WICKI: What if we go in there , and she 's not even there ?
LT.HICOX: We wait . Do n't worry , she 's a British spy , she 'll make the rendez-vous .
LT.NICOX: Stiglitz , right ?
STIGLITZ: That 's right , sir .
LT.HICOX: I hear your pretty good with that ? Meaning the blade . Stiglitz does n't answer .
STIGLITZ: I do n't look calm to you ?
LT.HICOX: Well , now you put it like that , I guess you do . He turns his attention back to his blade .
LT.ALDO: Is that the kinds man you need , the loquacious type ?
LT.HICOX: Fair point , Lieutenant .
LT.ALDO: So y'all git in trouble in there , what are we suppose to do ? Make bets on how it all comes out ?
LT.HICOX: If we get into trouble , we can handle it . But if trouble does happen , we need you to make damn sure no Germans , or French , fo matter , escape from that basement . If Frau Von Hammersmark 's cover is compromised , the mission is kaput .
SGT.DONOWITZ: Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark , who 's idea was it for the death trap edez-vous ?
LT.HICOX: She chose the spot .
SGT.DONOWITZ: Well is n't that just dandy ?
LT.HICOX: Look , she 's not a military strategist . She 's just a actress .
LT.ALDO: Ya do n't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you do n't want to fight in a basement .
LT.HICOX: She was n't picking a place to fight . She was picking a place , isolated , and without germans .
PFC.HIRSCHBERG: Lieutenant , I hate to be contrary , ut I got me a Nazi pissin on Louisianna two-o'clock .
LT.HICOX: Shit . Sgt.Donowitz chides him ;
SGT.DONOWITZ: So what do you think your fraulein Von Hammer -
LT.HICOX: - Obviously , I do n't know , Sgt .
STIGLITZ: If we 're going , let 's go . He sheaths the dagger .
WINNETOU: .okay , I 'm not German . Am I American ? The whole table bursts out laughing .
EDGAR WALLACE: Well , not really .
SGT.POLA NEGRI: What do you mean , not really ? Of course he is .
EDGAR WALLACE: Well if he 's so American , how come he 's never been translated into English ? He 's not American . He 's suppose to be American , but he 's not a American creation . In fact , he 's something very different .
WINNETOU: Okay , I 'm a fictional , literary character , from the past , I 'm American , and that 's controversial .
BRIDGET: Hello , my lovelies , I will join you in moments . I 'm finishing up a game with my five new friends here .
LT.HICOX: No hurry , Frau Von Hammersmark . Take your time , enjoy yourself .
BRIDGET: So who are you ?
WINNETOU: I am WINNETOU , CHIEF of the APACHES !
MATA HARI: Frau Von Hammersmark , when you friends came in , did you realize you did a double take , like in the movies ?
BRIDGET: Really ? No , I was n't aware of that at all .
MATA HARI: They must be second nature to you now ? Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies ?
BRIDGET: Well , yes they did , but it 's not really that difficult .
SGT.POLA NEGRI: Do one for us . The Tableheartily agrees .
MATA HARI: My turn , I want to try .
EDGER WALLACE: I want to try . He does .
BRIDGET: Gengus Khaun ! I would never of gotten that .
LT.HICOX: I thought this place was suppose to have more French then Germans ?
BRIDGET: Normally that 's true . The Sgt ove there 's wife , just had a baby . His commanding officer gave him , and his mates the night off to celebrate .
WICXI: We should leave .
BRIDGET: F No , we should stay . For one drink at least . I 've been waiting for you in a ar , it would look strange if we left efore we had a drink .
LT.HICOX: She 's right , just be calm , and enjoy your booze .
BRIDGET: There 's been some new developments . The cinema venue has changed .
LT.HICOX: Why ?
BRIDGET: No one knows . But that in itself should n't be a problem . The cinema it 's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz . So whateve materials you brought for The Ritz , should be doubly effective here . Now this next piece of information is colossal , try not to over react . The Fubrer , will be attending tomorrow . Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE . Bridget 's eyes bore holes in him .
SGT.POLA NEGRI: Frau Von Hammersmark , I was just thinking , could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday ?
BRIDGET: I 'd love to Wilhelm . This handsome happy Sgt , just became a father today .
SGT.POLA NEGRI: Thank you , heil Hitler .
BRIDGET: So Wilhelm , do you know the name of this progeny yet ?
SGT.POLA NEGRI: I most certainly do , fraulein . His name is Maximilian .
STIGLITZ: Wonderful name , Sgt .
SGT.POLA NEGRI: Thank you , Lieutenant . When he 's old enough to ride a bicycle , I will buy him a blue one . And I will paint on the side `` The Blue Max '' .
BRIDGET: There you go . But wait , I 'm not finished yet .
SGT.POLA NEGRI: Thank you fraulein , thank you . Max may not know who you are now . But he will . I will show him all of your movies . He will grow up with your films , and this napkin on his wall . Then , to the whole tavern
LT.HICOX: None of your business , Sgt . You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein , with your drunken oorish behavior , but you have wore out your welcome with me .
SGT.POLA NEGRI: Excuse me Cap't , but your accent is is very unusual .
WICKI: Sgt. ! You must be ether drunk or mad , to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness !
STIGLITZ: I 'm making YOU , ( Pointing at
WINNETOU: .and YOU , .. .responsible , for him . I suggest you take hold of your friend , or he 'll spend Max 's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness !
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Like the young newly christened father , I too have a acute ear for accents . And like him , I too find yours odd . From where do you hail , Cap't ? Wicki jumps in ;
WICKI: Major , this is highly inappr -
MAJOR HELLSTROM: T was n't speaking to you Lt.Saltzberg , ( Turning to
STIGLITZ: or you ether , Lt.Berlin . ( Looking at
HICOX: I was speaking to Cap't Idon't-know-what .
LT.HICOX: I was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: The mountain ?
LT.HICOX: Yes . In that village we all speak like this . Have you seen the Riefenstahl film ?
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Yes .
LT. HICOX: Then you saw me . You remember the skiing torch scene ?
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Yes I do .
LT.HICOX: In that scene was myself , my father , my sister , and my two brothers . My other is so handsome , the directo Pabst , gave him a Close Up .
BRIDGET: Major , if my word means anything , I can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said . He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu , he was in the film , and his brother is far more handsome then he . The impostors laugh .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: You should rejoin your friends .
BRIDGET: By all means , Major .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: So that 's the source of your bazaa accent ? Extraordinary . So what are you doing here Cap't ?
LT.HICOX: Aside from having a drink with the lovely fraulein ?
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Well that pleasure requires no explanation . ChuckleChuckle
MAJOR BELLSTROM: Worth knowing .
LT.HICOX: Well , there in lies the problem . We never claimed to be worth knowing . Chuckle Chuckle .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: All levity aside , what are you doing in France ?
LT.HICOX: Attending Goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Your the frauleins escort ?
LT.HICOX: Somebody has to carry the lighter . Chuckle chuckle .
BRIDGET: The Captain is my date , but all three are my guests . We 're old friends Major , who go back along time . Longer then a actress would care to admit . Chuckle chuckle .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Well , in that case , let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room .
BRIDGET: I 'll drink to that .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: I must say , that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun . I did n't join them , because your quite right Cap't , officers and enlisted men should n't fraternize . But seeing as we 're all officers here , ( Bowing to
BRIDGET: .and sophisticated lady friends of officers . What say we play the game ?
MAJOR HELLSTROM: So the object of the game , is to write the name of a famous person on your card . Real or fictitious , does n't matter . Fo instance , you could write Confucius o Fu Manchu . ( He SNAPS his
FINGERS: Eric ' More pens . And they must be famous . No Aunt Inga 's . When you finish writing , put the card face down on the table , and move it to the person to your left . The person to your right , will move their card in front of you . You pick up the card without looking at it , lick the back , and stick it on your forehead like so . He demonstrates .
CON'T: And in ten yes or no questions , you must guess who you are
MAJOR HELLSTROM: .So let 's give it a try , shall we ? Everybody write your names . The Five players write their names Then move their cards to the right
HELLSTROMVON HAMMERSMARKWICKIHICOXSTIGLITZ: is is is is is
MAJ.KING KONG: I 'll start , give you the idea . Am I German ? They laugh .
BRIDGET: No .
MAJ.KING KONG: Am I a American ? They laugh - but then Wicki says ;
WICKI: Wait a minute , he goes to
BRIDGET: Do n't be ridiculous , obviously he was n't orn in America .
MAJ.KING KONG: So . I visited America , aye ? The Table says ; `` Yes '' .
WICKI: Not for you .
MAJ.KING KONG: .Bummm . My native land , is it what one would call , exotic ?
MAJ.KING KONG: When I arrived in America , Was I displayed in chains ? `` Yes '' .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Nov since I answered correctly , you all need to finnish your drinks .
LT.HICOX: Major , I do n't mean to be rude . But the four of us are very good friends . And the four of us have n't seen each othe in quite a while . So Major , I 'm afraid , you are intruding .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: I beg to differ Cap't . It 's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion , that I become a intruder . How about it fraulein ? Am I intruding ?
BRIDGET: Of course not , Major .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: I did n't think so . It 's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms .
LT.HICOX: Your most gracious , sir .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Eric , the thirty-three , and new glasses ! You do n't want to contaminate the thirty- three with the swill you were drinking .
ERIC: How many glasses ?
LT.HICOX: Five glasses .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Not me . I like scotch , scotch does n't like me .
BRIDGET: Nor I. I 'll stay with bubbly .
LT.HICOX: Three glasses .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: To a thousand year Reich !
LT.HICOX: Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles ?
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Because you 've just given yourself away , Cap't . Your no more German then that scotch .
LT.HICOX: Well , -Major -
BRIDGET: - Major -
MAJOR HELLSTROM: - Shut up slut . You were saying ?
LT.HICOX: I was saying that makes two of us . I 've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down .
SGT.STIGLITZ: That makes three of us .
SGT.STIGLITZ: And at this range , I 'm a real Fredrick Zoller .
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Hummmmm Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here .
BRIDGET: Then Major , i implore you . For the sake of those German troops , will you please leave with us ?
MAJOR HELLSTROM: Oh Bridget , your concern for German troops , gets me .right here . You mean for the sake your whore legs , do n't you ? You ca n't afford to get any bullet holes in them , your not finished spreading them fo all the Hollywood Jews .

LT.ALDO: Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya , you need to answer a few questions
BRIDGET: Few questions about what ?
LT.ALDO: About I got three men dead back there , and why do n't you try tellin us what the fuck happened ?
BRIDGET: The British officer blew his German act , and a Gestapo Major saw it .
LT.ALDO: 'fore we get into who shot John , why did you invite my men to a endez-vous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis ?
BRIDGET: I can see , since you did n't see what happened inside , the Nazi 's eing there must look odd .
LT.ALDO: Yeah , we got ta word for that kinda odd in English , it 's called , suspicious .
BRI DGET: Do n't let your imagination get the etter of you , Lieutenant . You met the sergeant , Willi . He had a baby tonight . His commanding officer gave him and his friends the night off to celebrate . The Germans being there was just a tragic coincidence . Aldo thinks for a moment
LT. ALDO: Okay , I 'll buy that . He was ethe there with his men waiting for us , or he was there celebrating his sons birthday , he was n't doin both .
LT.ALDO: How did the shootin start ?
BRIDGET: The English man , gave himself away .
LT. ALDO: How did he do that ?
BRIDGET: He ordered three glasses . She holds up three fingers , index to pinky .
LT. ALDO: Okay , let 's pretend there were no Germans , and everything went exactly the way it was suppose to . What would of been the next step ?
BRIDGET: Tuxedos . To get them into the premiere , wearing military uniforms , with all the military there , would of been suicide . But going as members of the German film industry , they wear tuxedos , and blend in with everybody else . I arranged a tailo to fit three tuxedos tonight .
LT.ALDO: How did you intend to get them into the premiere ?
BRIDGET: Hand me my purse .
LT. ALDO: Can you still get us in that premiere ?
BRIDGET: Can you speak German better then you friends , no . Have I been shot , yes . I do n't see me tripping the light fantastique up the red carpet any time soon . Least of all by tomorrow night .
PAUSE: However , there 's something you do n't know . There 's been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino . One , the venue has been changed from The Ritz , to a much smaller venue .
LT.ALDO: Enormous changes at the last minute ? That 's not very Germatic . Why the hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn peculiar ?
BRIDGET: It probably has something to do with the second development .
LT. ALDO: Which is ?
GERMAN: I 've been rethinking my position in egards to your Paris premiere of `` Nations Pride '' . As the weeks have gone on , and the Americans are on the beach , I do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller . This boy has done something tremendous for us . And I 'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful .
BRIDGET: The Fuhrer 's attending the premiere .
SGT.DONOWITZ: What ?
LT.ALDO: When the hell did this happen ?
BRIDGET: The venue change , two weeks ago . The Fuhrer 's attendance , four days ago .
LT. ALDO: And how come London do n't know nothing about that ?
BRIDGET: We need to get something straight , once and for all . Everything London knows , it learned from me . If I do n't know , London does n't know . So now , this is me , informing you , Hitler 's coming to Paris .
BRIDGET: What are you thinking ?
LT.ALDO: I 'm thinking getting a wack at plantin ole Uncle Adolph makes this a horse of a different color .
BRIDGET: What 's that suppose to mean ?
LT.ALDO: It means , your gettin us in that premiere .
BRIDGET: I 'm going to probably end up losing this leg , bye bye acting career , fun while it lasted . How do you expect me to walk up a red carpet ?
LT.ALDO: The doggie docs gon na dig that slug outta your gam . Then he 's gon na wrap it up in a cast , and you got ta good how I broke my leg mountain climbing story . That 's German , ai n't it ? Y'all like climbin mountains , don'tch ?
BRIDGET: I do n't . I like smoking , drinking , and ordering in restaurants , but I see your point .
LT. ALDO: We fill ya up with morphine , till it 's comin out ya ears . Then just limp your little ass up that ouge car-pet .
BRIDGET: Splendid . When the Nazi 's put me up against a wall , it wo n't hurt so much . I know this is a silly question efore I ask it , but can you American 's speak any other language then English ?
HIRSCHBERG: Other then Yiddish ?
BRIDGET: Preferably . Donny referring to Aldo and himself .
SGT.DONOWITZ: We both speak alittle Italian .
BRIDGET: With a atrocious accent , no doubt . But that does n't exactly kill us in the crib . Germans do n't have a good ear for Italian . So you mumble Italian , and brazen through it , is that the plan ?
LT. ALDO: That 's about it .
BRIDGET: That sounds good .
LT. ALDO: it sounds like shit , but what else we gon na do , go home ?
BRIDGET: No , it 's good . If you do n't blow it , with that , I can get you in the uilding . So , who does what ?
LT.ALDO: Well I speak the most Italian , so I 'll be your escort . Donowitz speaks the second most , so he 'll be you Italian cameraman . And Hirschberg third most , so he 'll be Donnys assistant .
HIRSCHBERG: I do n't speak Italian .
LT. ALDO: Like I said , third best . Just keep your fuckin mouth shut . In fact why do n't you start practising , right now .
BRIDGET: What about the little one ?
UTIVICH: Do you mean me ?
BRIDGET: I did n't mean any offence .
UTIVICH: None taken you German cunt .
LT.ALDO: Utivich is the chauffeur .
UTIVICH: I ca n't drive . Bridget SCREAMS in frustration ;
BRIDGET: You Americans are fucking useless !
UTIVICH: IVGimmie a break , I 'm from Manhattan .
LT.ALDO: No worries , son . We got over fourteen hours before the movie tomorrow . More then enough time for you to learn to drive .
UTIVICH: NO no no no , Lieutenant , it 's not !
LT.ALDO: Oh yes yes yes yes , Private , it is . And yes yes yes yes , you will . Look Utivich , you and I both know , if we went to grade school together , you damn sure ai n't copyin off of my test . Well I ler n't to drive in fou hours on a Tennessee mountain road . And I 'm a shit for brains coal mine ootlegger . Hirschberg , you know how to drive , right ?
HIRSCHBERG: Yes .
LT.ALDO: Teach 'em .
BRIDGET: But there is a problem . I 'm a movie star . This is a movie premiere . I ca n't show up looking like I was just in a Nazi gun fight . Now I have a dress for the premiere at my hotel . But sometime tomorrow , I have to get my hair done .
LT. ALDO: Sister , you must got wunderbar luck . Guess who went to beauty school ? The CAMERA WHIP PANS to SGT.DONOWITZ . Bridget rolls her eyes .
MARCEL: Ooh lala , Danielle Darrieux , this is so exciting . Pleased to meet you .
SHOSANNA: Shut up fool .
MARCEL: Reel one is on the first projector . Reel two is on the second . Three and four are ready to go .
SHOSANNA: Okay , the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel . Our film , comes on in the forth reel , so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel , go down and lock the doors of the auditorium . Then take your place ehind the screen , and wait for my CUE , when I give it to you , BURN IT DOWN !
COL.LANDA: I want everybody out of this room ! They start to leave .
WEAKLY: Yes Colonel .
COL.LANDA: Tell me everything that happened in there ?
CU COL.LANDA: smiles .
COL.LANDA: Fraulein Von Hammersmark , what has befallen Germany 's most elegant swan ?
BRIDGET: Colonel Landa , it 's been years . Dashing as ever I see .
COL.LANDA: Flattery will get you everywhere , fraulein . They chuckle , and air kiss .
BRIDGET: Save your flattery , you old dog . I know too many of your forme conquests , to fall into that honey pot . Chuckle-chuckle
COL.LANDA: Seriously , what happened ?
BRIDGET: Well , I tried my hand , foolishly I might add , at mountain climbing . And this was the result .
COL.LANDA: Mountain climbing ? That 's how you injured your leg , mountain climbing ?
BRIDGET: Believe it or not , yes it is . A brief moment passes between the two
COL.LANDA: Forgive me , fraulein . I do n't mean laugh at your misfortune . It 's just .mountain climbing ? I 'm curious fraulein , what could of eve compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor ?
BRIDGET: Well , I chant be doing it again , I can tell you that .
COL.LANDA: That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustave , when were you climbing this mountain , last night ?
BRIDGET: Very good eye , Colonel . It happened yesterday morning .
COL.LANDA: Hummm . And where exactly in Paris is this mountain ? This stops her for a seconded .
BRIDGET: I 'm afraid neither three speak a word of German . Their friends of mine from Italy . This is a wonderful Italian stuntman , Antonio Margheriti . A very talented cameraman , Enzo Gorlomi . And Enzo 's camera assistant , Dominick Decocco .
ITALIAN: Gentlemen , this is a old friend , Col. Sans Landa of the S.S .
COL.LANDA: Margheriti ?
ITALIAN: Am I saying it correctly ? .Margheriti ?
ITALIAN: Yes . Correct .
ITALIAN: Margheriti . Say it for me once please ?
LT. ALDO: Margheriti .
ITALIAN: I 'm sorry , again ?
LT.ALDO: I4argheriti .
ITALIAN: Once more . ?
LT.ALDO: Margheriti .
COL.LANDA: Nargheriti .
FRENCH: It means daisies , I believe . Turning his gaze to Donny .
ITALIAN: What 's your name again ?
SGT.DONOWITZ: Enzo Gorlomi .
ITALIAN: Again . ?
SGT.DONOWITZ: Gorlomi .
ITALIAN: One more time , but let me really hear the music in it .
HAMMY ITALIAN: Gorlomi . Now to Hirschberg
ITALIAN: And you ?
HIRSCHBERG: Dominick Decocco .
COL.LANDA: Dominick Decocco ?
HIRSCHBERG: Dominick Decocco .
COL.LANDA: Bravo . Bravo .
GERMAN: Well , my two cameraman friends need to find there seats .
GERMAN: Not so fast , lets enjoy some champagne . Everyone gets a glass .
FRENCH: - Oh , Mademoiselle Mimieux , please join us , I have some friends I 'd like you to meet .
FRENCH: May I say Mademoiselle , you look divine .
FRENCH: Merci ' .
GERMAN: This lovely young lady , is Mademoiselle Emmanuelle Mimieux , this is her cinema , and she is our hostess for the evening .
FRENCH: And Mademoiselle , this battered , broken , and none worse for the wear German goddess , is Bridget Von Hammersmark .
BRIDGET: Bonjour .
SHOSANNA: Bon jour .
FRENCH: I 'm afraid my companions do n't speak any French , there Italian . This is Antonino , Enzo , and Dominick .
FRENCH: Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks Italian associates , need help finding there seats . Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind to escort them ?
FRENCH: It would be my pleasure . Let me see your tickets ?
HIRSCHBERG: Grazie .
SHOSANNA: Prego .
GERMAN SOLDIER: Take your seats ! The show is about to egin ! Everybody take your seatsl
GERMAN: I must call The Fuhrer . He does n't want to make his entrance untill everybody seated . Come with me Frau Von Hammersmark . The Fuhrer has heard your here , and he wishes to commend you personally .
GERMAN: Me ? Why ?
GERMAN: Do n't be modest . Everybody is quite taken with your resolve . A accident , like you 've just experienced , and yet you still show up to to a important Party event . The Fuhre was quite adamant in his gratitude . We 'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux 's office . I 'm afraid I must rob you of you companion , but only for a moment .
ITALIAN: Yes , apparently The Fuhrer wishes to commend me .
ITALIAN: Wait here a moment . I promise I wo n't detain her long . What are ether of them suppose to do , argue ?
COL.LANDA: Have a seat fraulein .
GERMAN: Let me see your foot .
GERMAN: I beg your pardon ?
COL.LANDA: Put your foot in my lap .
BRIDGET: Colonel , you embarrass me .
COL.LANDA: I assure you fraulein , my intention is not to flirt . Patting his lap more with more aggression .
GERMAN: What now Colonel ?
GERMAN: Do you admit you treachery ? She stares defiant daggers into him .
GERMAN: The only thing I will admit to , is esisting you
ENGLISH: Sons-a-bitches..
GERMAN: .to my last breath .
GERMAN: `` Resist to your last breath '' ?
BANG?: She 's dead .
COL.LANDA: Inform The Fuhrer the audience has taken there seats , and we 're ready to begin . Step one , in Hans master plan , done . He then dials another number
LT. ALDO: Hans Landa ?
COL.LANDA: You 've had a nice long run , Aldo . Alas , your now in the hands of the SS . My hands to be exact . And they 've een waiting along time , to touch you .
LT.ALDO: Utivich ?
UTIVICH: Is that you Lieutenant ?
LT. ALDO: Yep .
UTIVIC}I: Do you know what happened to Donny ? Hirchberg ? The woman ?
LT.ALDO: No I do not .
UTIVICH: Lieutenant , sorry I 'm crying .
LT. ALDO: Nothin to be sorry about , son . This bag , get to anyone .
UTIVICH: Not exactly John Wayne , am I ?
LT.ALDO: John Waynes a pampered movie star . He burst into tears , if his cook , usts his yoke at breakfast . Just try puttin a bag over his head , and hear what kinda sounds he makes . Utivich , giggles through the tears .
COL.LANDA: Italian ? Really ?
BEAT: What could you have possibly been thinking ?
LT. ALDO: Well , I speak alittle Italian -
COL.LANDA: I speak a little Tagalog , but I would n't begin to presume I could pass for Filipino . Do n't get me wrong , I understand you were in a pickle , what with you losing you Germans . And I have nothing but admiration for improvisation . Still . Chico Marx is more convincing . if the three of you had shown up to the premiere dressed in womans attire , it would have been more convincing .
GERMAN: You may leave us . But stay alert outside .
COL.LANDA: So your Aldo the Apache ?
LT. ALDO: So your The Jew Hunter ?
COL.LANDA: Jew Hunter , , I 'm a detective . A damn good detective . Finding people is my specialty . So naturally , I worked for the Nazi 's finding people . And yes , some of them were Jews . But Jew Hunter ? Just the name that stuck .
UTIVICH: Well you do hafts admit , it is catchy .
COL.LANDA: Do you control the nicknames , you enemies bestow on you ? Aldo the Apache and The Little Man ?
UTIVICH: What do you mean , The Little Man ?
COL.LANDA: The Germans nickname for you .
UTIVICH: The Germans nickname for me is , The Little Man ?
COL.LANDA: Or `` The Little One , ether one means you . And as if to make my point , I 'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life . I mean , your a little fellow . But not circus midget little , as your reputation would suggest .
LT.ALDO: Where is my men ? Where is Bridget Von Hammersmark ?
COL.LANDA: Bridget Von Hammersmark . Oh I 'm sure she 's in whatever , big bubbling cesspool in hell , the devil reserves for traitors of her ilk .
COR'T: Well , lets just say , she got what she deserved . And when you purchase friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark , you get what you pay for . Now as far as your Pisanos , Sgt.Donowitz , and Pt.Hirschberg-
LT. ALDO: How do you know our names ?
COL.LANDA: Lt.Aldo , if you do n't think I would n't interrogate every single one of you swastika marked survivors . ? We simply are n't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed . Now , back to the whereabouts of you two Italian saboteurs . At this moment , both Hirschberg , and Donowitz , should be sitting in the very seats we left them in . Seats , 0023 and 0024 , if my memory serves . Explosives , still around there ankle , still ready to explode . And your mission , some would call a terrorist plot , as of this moment , is still a go .
LT. ALDO: That 's a pretty exciting story . What 's next , Eliza on the ice ?
COL.LANDA: However , all I have to do , is pick pick up that phone right there . Inform the cinema , and your plans kupet .
LT. ALDO: IF , their still there , and IF thei still alive , and that 's one big IF , there ai n't no way , you gon na take them boys without settin off them ombs .
PAUSE: But if I do n't pick up that phone , ight there , you may very well get all four . And if you get all four , you end the wartonight .
COL.LANDA: So gentlemen , lets discuss the prospect of ending the war-tonight . All three have their Chianti filled glasses .
LT. ALDO: I guess so .
COL.LANDA: How about you Uitivich ?
UITIVICH: I guess so too .
COL.LANDA: Good , we more or less , all agree . Gentlemen , I have no intention , of Killing Hitler , and killing Goebbels , and Killing Gerring , and killing Boorman , not to mention winning the war single handedly for the allies , only later , to find myself standing efore a Jewish tribunal .
LT.ALDO: What kinda deal ?
COL.LANDA: The kind you would n't have the authority to make . However , I 'm sure this mission of yours , has a commanding officer ? A General , I 'm etting . For ..
THINKING: .O.S.S . would be my guess . Aldo 's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess .
COL.LANDA: Oooh , that 's a bingo . Is that the way you say it , That 's a bingo ?
LT.ALDO: You just say , bingo .
COL.LANDA: Bingo ! How fun . But I digress , where were we ? Oh yes , make a deal . Ove there is a very capable two way adio . And sitting behind it , is a more then capable radio operator , named Herrman . Get me somebody on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen , to authorize my - Let 's call it , the terms of my conditional surrender , if that taste etter going down .
COL.LANDA: I want my full military pension and enefits under my proper rank . I want to receive the congregational medal of honor , for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich .
PAUSE: I look forward to seeing you face to face as well , sir .
LT.ALDO: Yes , sir ?
LT.ALDO: Yes , sir .
COL.LANDA: So I suppose the only thing left to do is lift a glass , and toast to Donowitz and Hirschbergs success . You too Herrman , come over here .
RUSSIAN: What 's the death toll ?
RUSSIAN: 47 , so far .
RUSSIAN: 48 . General , I implore you , we must destroy that tower !
RUSSIAN: That tower is one of the oldest , and most beautiful structures in Russia . I wo n't be responsible for turning a thousand years of history into dust !
MARCEL: It 's time . I should go lock the auditorium , and take my place behind the screen .
HIRSCHBERG: What-a ?
SGT.DONOWITZ: They-o Look-o Screen-a , Not-o You-a .
HIRSCHBERG: Fantastic-o .

SHOSANNA: What are you doing here ?
FREDRICK: I came to visit you .
SHOSANNA: Ca n't you see how busy I am ?
FREDRICK: Then allow me to lend a assist .
SHOSANNA: Fredrick it 's not funny , you ca n't e here . This is your premiere , you need to be out there with them .
FREDRICK: Normally , you would be.right . And for all the other films I do , I intend to endure evenings like tonight , in the proper sprit . However the fact remains , this film , is based on my military exploits . And in this case , my exploits consisted of me killing many men . Consequently , the part of the film that 's playing now , .I do n't like watching this part .
SHOSANNA: Fredrick , I am sorry , but -
FREDRICK: - So , I thought , I 'd come up here and do what I do best , annoy you . And from the look on your face , it would appear I have n't lost my touch .
GERMAN: Hey Fritz , you owe me three cigarettes , now pay up .
SHOSANNA: I have to get prepared for the reel change .
FREDRICK: Let me do it ?
SHOSANNA: No .
FREDRICK: Oh please , it 's been two years since i 've done a reel change .
SHOSANNA: I said , no .
FREDRICK: Come on , it 's my premiere .
SHOSANNA: Are you so use to the Nazi 's kissing your ass , you 've forgotten what the word , Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°No '' means ? No Fredrick , you ca n't come in here , now go away !
FREDRICK: Well , it 's nice to know you can feel something . Even if it 's just physical pain . Fredrick steps forward Shosanna steps backwards
SWASTIKA FOREHEAD: The Bear Jew ! 1 !
FREDRICK: What the hell was that ?
HITLER: Extraordinary Joseph , simply extraordinary . This is your finest film yet .
BEHIND SCREEN: Marcel , smoking , waiting for his cue
MOVIE ZOLLER: Who wants to send a message to Germany ?
HIRSCHBERG: react .
MARCEL: smiles .
HERRMAN: These are the American lines , sir .
COL.LANDA: Okay Gentlemen , you can climb down .
LT.ALDO: Thank you very much Colonel . Uitivich , cuff the Colonel 's hands behind his ack .
COL.LANDA: Is that really necessary ?
LT.ALDO: I 'm a slave to appearances .
COL.LANDA: Are you mad ? What have you done ? I made a deal with your General for that mans life !
LT. ALDO: Yeah , they made that deal , but they do n't give a fuck about him , they need you .
COL.LANDA: You 'll be shot for this .
LT.ALDO: Raw I do n't think so , more like I 'll e chewed out . I 've been chewed out efore . You know , Uitvich and myself , heard that deal you made with the Brass . End the war tonight ? I 'd make that deal . How bout you Uitivich , you make that deal ?
UITIVICH: I 'd make that deal .
LT.ALDO: I do n't blame ya . Damn good deal . And that pretty little nest ya feathered for yourself . Well , if your willing to barbecue the whole high command , I suppose that 's worth certain considerations . Now I do n't care about you gettin pensions , merit badges , ticker tape parades , who gives a damn , let 's all go home . But .1do have one question ? When you go to your little place on Nantuckett Island , I image you gon na take off that handsome looking SS uniform of yours , ai n't ya ?

WIGAND: Black , black Lowell gives him his cup of coffee .
LOWELL: Is there anything you want to know about me , Mr. Wigand ?
WIGAND: Like what ? Your sign ? Lowell smiles .
LOWELL: Just so I know you know , when I talk to people in confidence , it stays that way .
WIGAND: How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS ? Lowell looks at him , he does his homework
LOWELL: I still do the tough stories . `` 60 Minutes '' reaches a lot of people . Wigand 's quiet , measuring him .
WIGAND: Let me see the documents
LOWELL: Far as you go where ?
WIGAND: This issue is a drop in the bucket . I can talk to you about what 's in here . But I ca n't talk to you about anything else .
LOWELL: Between journalists and management , yes , I believe they dobut I do n't take that seriously . Where do you work ?
WIGAND: Did work .
LOWELL: Did work .
WIGAND: How much would I get paid ?
LOWELL: That , you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs . But , for something like this , I would say anywhere between 10 , 12 thousand . Wigand nods `` Okay . ''
WIGAND: Should I just take the documents now ?
LOWELL: If you want to do it .
WIGAND: I worked as the head of Research and Development for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company . I was a Corporate Vice President . Mr. Bergman
MIKE WALLACE: `` President Assad of Syria said that difficult obstacles remain but that his country , quote , 'looks forward to a great , long peace with Israel . ' ''

DEBBIE DELUCA: Okay .
UNIFORMED SECURITY: Mr. Wigand , you can go up now He gets up , crossing to an elevator .
THOMAS SANDEFUR: Sorry . I 'm accepting an award from the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation . It 's going to kill the rest of my day .
WIGAND: Seven
THOMAS SANDEFUR: And , he gets out there and he has five strokes on us . He has more concentration than anybody I 've ever met . It 's spooky how he can concentrate .
WIGAND: I 'd rather play than talk about it . What did you want to see me about ? I do n't like being back here . Sandefur smiles , used to him .
THOMAS SANDEFUR: Jeffrey says exactly what 's on his mind . Most people consider what they 're sayingsocial skills Jeffrey just charges right ahead . Now , I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of you severance agreement with Brown & Williamson , Jeff
WIGAND: Chapter and verse .
THOMAS SANDEFUR: Yeah , I know you do You know , I came up through sales . One of the reasons I was a great salesman , was I never made a promise I could n't keep . I knew that if I ever broke my promise I 'd suffer the consequence And there 's a warning behind it
WIGAND: Is that a threat ?
THOMAS SANDEFUR: we worked together for , what was it , three years ? Now , the work we did here is confidential , not for public scrutinyany more than are one 's family matters
WIGAND: You threatening my family , now , too ?
THOMAS SANDEFUR: Now , do n't be paranoid , Jeff . About the direction of research here , we may have had our differences of opinion
WIGAND: `` Research '' You declare , as a badge of honor , you do n't even know what makes water boil
THOMAS SANDEFUR: That 's why we hire scientists
WIGAND: Okay . I do n't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements . I was paid well for my work . The health and welfare enefits are good . The severance package is fair . I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I would n't .
THOMAS SANDEFUR: I appreciate all that , Jeff . But , upon eflectionwe 've decided to expand ou zone of comfort with you .
WIGAND: And if I do n't ?
A LAWYER: If we `` arrive '' at the conclusion you 're acting in bad faith ? We would terminate , ight now , payouts under your severance package . You and your family 's medical enefits . And initiate litigation against you , Mr. Wigand .
WIGAND: Dr. Wigand .
A LAWYER: u > Dr . Wigandafter you 've examined the document , you will see it is in your own est interest and you 'll sign it .
WIGAND: So , what you are saying is it is n't enough that you fired me . For no good eason ! Now you question my integrity ? On top of the humiliation of being fired ? You threaten me ? ! You threaten my family ? ! It never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement But I will tell you , Mr. Sandefur , and Brown & Williamson , too Fuck me ? Well , fuck you ! !
A LAWYER: I 'm not sure he got the message
THOMAS SANDEFUR: Oh , I think he did .
LOWELL: Yeah
WIGAND: protect your sources ! You screwed me ! You sold me out !
LOWELL: What are you talking about ? Where are you ?
WIGAND: Fuck you , too ! And he slams down the phone .
LIANE: Jeffrey , you forgot their lunches
LOWELL: Mrs. Wigand , how do you do ?
WIGAND: Jump in , quick , c'mon
LOWELL: I 'm Lowell Bergman . We spoke on the phone , remember ?
WIGAND: Good . I want to talk to you .
LOWELL: I did not burn you . I did not give you up to anyone !
WIGAND: This is my house In front of my wife , my kids ? ! What business do we have ?
LOWELL: To straighten something out with you . Right here . Right now .
WIGAND: So , you did n't mention my name ? You have n't talked to anybody about me ?
LOWELL: Why am I gon na mention your name ?
WIGAND: How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you ?
LOWELL: How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson ?
LOWELL: And I do n't like paranoid accusations ! I 'm a journalist . Think . Use your head . How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me
WIGAND: You came all the way down here to tell me that ?
LOWELL: No . I did not . Big Tobacco is a big story . And you got something important to say . I can tell . But , yes . I did . I came all the way down here to tell you
WIGAND: Ride with me while I take the girls to school
LOWELL: They 're afraid of you , are n't they ?
WIGAND: They should be . The sound of the rain
LOWELL: Talk to me outside the zone of you agreement ?
WIGAND: Like what ?
LOWELL: Like where 'd you work before Brown & Williamson ?
WIGAND: Johnson & Johnson . Union Carbide in Japan . I was general manager and director of new products . I speak Japanese . I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer . All health- elated . What else ? Outside the `` zone '' ?
LOWELL: I do n't knowyou think the Knicks are gon na make it through the semi-finals ?
WIGAND: For example . James Burke , the CEO of Johnson & Johnsonwhen he found out that some lunatic had put poison in
LOWELL: Seven dwarfs ?
WIGAND: The seven CEOs of Big Tobaccothey got up in front of Congress that timeit was on television
LOWELL: and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction , disease
WIGAND: It was on C-SPAN . Yeah .
LOWELL: Okay , so , here you areyou go to work for tobacco . You come from corporate cultures where esearch , really , creative thinking , these are core values . You go to tobacco Tobacco is a sales culture . Market and sell enormous volume . Go to a lot of golf tournaments . The hell with everything else . What are you doing ? Why are you working for `` tobacco '' in the first place ?
WIGAND: I ca n't talk about it . The work I was supposed to domight have had some positive effect . I do n't knowit could have been beneficial . Mostly , I got paid a lot . I took the money . My wife was happy . My kids had good medical . Good schools . Got a great house . I mean , what the hell is wrong with that ?
LOWELL: Nothing 's wrong with that . That 's it ; you 're making moneyyou 're providing for your family ? What could be wrong with that ? It 's quiet . After some moments
WIGAND: I 've always thought of myselfas a man of science . That 's what 's wrong with it .
LOWELL: Thenyou 're in a state of conflict , Jeff . Jeffrey does n't say anything .
WIGAND: I 've got to go pick up the girls . They only had half a day
MIKE WALLACE: Well , it is n't `` cigarettes are bad fo you ''
LOWELL: Hardly new news .
MIKE WALLACE: No shit .
LOWELL: What 's this ?
MARK STERN: What that is is tobacco 's standard defense . It 's the `` we do n't know '' litany `` Addiction ? We believe not . Disease ? We do n't know . We take a bunch of leaves , roll 'em together . You smoke 'em . After that ? You 're on your own . We do n't know . '' Sotells me nothing . Besides , you 'll never get what he 's got .
LOWELL: Why not ?
JOHN HARRIS: Because of this guy 's confidentiality agreement , he is never gon na be able to talk to you .
LOWELL: That 's not good enough . This guy is the top scientist in the number three tobacco company in America . He 's a corporate
JOHN HARRIS: Does n't matter what he wants .
MIKE WALLACE: Am I missing something here ?
JOHN HARRIS: What do you mean , Mike ?
MIKE WALLACE: He 's got a corporate secrecy agreement ? Give me a break . This is a public-health issue , like an unsafe airframe on a passenger jet orsome company dumping cyanide into the East River . Issues like that ? He can talk , we can air it . They 've got no right to hide behind a corporate agreement . Pass the milk
JOHN HARRIS: They do n't need the right . They 've got the money .
MARK STERN: The unlimited checkbook . That 's how Big Tobacco wins every time . On everything . They spend you to death . $ 600 million a year in outside legal . Chadbourne-Parke . Ken Starr 's firm , Kirkland and Ellis . Listen . GM and Ford , they get nailed after 11 or 12 pick-ups blow up . Right ? These clowns have neverI mean ever
JOHN HARRIS: Not even once
MARK STERN: not even with hundreds of thousands dying each year from an illness related to their producthave ever lost a personal-injury lawsuit . On this case , they 'll issue gag orders , sue for breach , anticipatory breach , enjoin him , you , us , his pet dog , the dog 's veterinarian Tie him up in litigation for ten of fifteen years . I 'm telling you , they bat a thousand . Every time . He knows that . That 's why he 's not gon na talk to you
LOWELL: Okay , let 's look through the looking glass the other way
MIKE WALLACE: What do you mean ?
LOWELL: We got a guywho wants to talk but he 's constrained . What if he were `` compelled '' ?
MIKE WALLACE: Oh , torture ? Great ratings .
MARK STERN: What do you mean compelled ?
LOWELL: I mean compelled by a Justice Department , state courts , be a witness . That would cut through any confidentiality agreement , would n't it ?
MARK STERN: Yeah
DEBBIE DELUCA: What does that do ?
LOWELL: What do you mean , what 's it do ?
DEBBIE DELUCA: What I mean is , like , how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement ?
LOWELL: Because he has to reveal it in a court of law . It 's on record , it 's out . It 's no secret anymore . So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate ? It 's out in the world
MARK STERN: If you could engineer it into the court ecord , you might have something . They would have a helluva time trying to estrain his speech then , would n't they ? Pause .
JOHN HARRIS: Yeah , but what venue ? And where does he get - does he have killer attorneys ?
LOWELL: I do n't think he 's got any attorneys .
MARK STERN: He 's gon na need attorneys who are n't afraid of risking years of litigation . And millions of dollars of their own < /u dough in legal costs
LOWELL: What do you say , Mike ? What do you think ?
MIKE WALLACE: Even if he gets the defense team , will he go for it ?
MRS. WATSON: you 're awfully overqualified , Dr. Wigand .
WIGAND: I 'm trying tostart a new career I elieve I could be a good teacher
MRS. WATSON: Let me give it some thought
WIGAND: and not a lot of companies in the health-care field hire ex-tobacco scientists . She nods , studying him . They get up .
LIANE: That 's where our babies were born Debbie took her first steps , right therein the grass . And they 're quiet .
WIGAND: Hey , hey , hey , c'mon . C'mon . We can make this work for us . Okay ? It 's justit 's a smaller scale . Simplereasiermore time . More time together . More time with the kids . More time for us , okay ? It 's just Can you imagine me coming home from some jo feeling good at the end of the day ? This is gon na be better . This is gon na be etter .
BARBARA: What 's that outside , Daddy ?
WIGAND: Did you see somebody or did you hea them ?
BARBARA: I heard them .
WIGAND: Where ?
BARBARA: In the backyard .
WIGAND: Sit at Daddy 's desk , okay ? Why do n't you just sit up at the desk . Get out some paper and draw me a picture , okay ? What are you gon na draw me , baby ? An animal , something like that ? You stay down here until Daddy gets backalright , Barbara ? You stay down here .
LOWELL: Yeah

WIGAND: The new place ? New .
LOWELL: You okay ?
WIGAND: Good . You have kids ?
LOWELL: Jeffrey , describe for me in detail what happened .
WIGAND: Well , no , lookI mean , there was a footprint . Forget it . It 's probably not important at all . You know , I got a job now . I 'm teaching high school . Japanese and Chemistry . So , what were you calling about ?
LOWELL: Oh , yes , yes , yes , I didI wanted to talk to you . I wanted to hook up and talk to you . About what we were talking about in your car .
WIGAND: okay .
LOWELL: Makes you feel good ? Putting what you know to use ?
WIGAND: How 'd you know that , Lowell ?
LOWELL: It 's obvious , is n't it ? He looks at Liane in the next room , asleep .
WIGAND: Yeah Look , thanks for talking . I 'm sorry I woke you up .
LOWELL: It 's okay .
WIGAND: Lowell ? But there 's thick silence .
LOWELL: What did you get us ?
WIGAND: Tempura And Wigand drinks some more saki . WIGAND The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin , then went to UC La Jolla with ProfessorMarcus ?
LOWELL: Marcuse . Yeah . He was my mentor . He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60sand on me , personally .
WIGAND: Next to your father ?
LOWELL: My father ? What the hell 's that got to do with my father ?
WIGAND: Is that why you became a journalist ? Then you get to ask all the questions ?
LOWELL: You charge by the hour ?
WIGAND: My father was a mechanical engineermost ingenious man I eve knew .
LOWELL: Well , my father left us when I was five-
WIGAND: Why ?
LOWELL: They 're gon na dig up stuff from you past , they 're gon na throw it at you . I got to know what they 're gon na throw . You understand ?
WIGAND: I drink . A couple of occasions more than I should have .
LOWELL: I 'm not pushing you around ! I 'm asking you questions .
WIGAND: I 'm just a commodity to you , are n't I ? I could be anything . Right ? Anything worth putting on between commercials
LOWELL: to a network , probably , we 're allnot a commodity . What you are is important .
WIGAND: No .
LOWELL: You should . Because when you 're done , a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion , my friend . And that 's the power you have .
WIGAND: You believe that ?
LOWELL: I believe that ? Yes , I believe that .
WIGAND: You believe that because you get information out to peoplesomething happens ?
LOWELL: Yes .
WIGAND: Maybe that 's just what you 've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job ? Having status ? And maybe for the audience , it 's just voyeurism ? Something to do on a Sunday night . And maybe it wo n't change a fucking thing . And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry . Used up ! Broke , alone !
LOWELL: Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here ? ! I neve abandoned a source !
WIGAND: I do n't think you really understand
WIGAND: I have to put my family 's welfare on the line here , my friend ! And what are you puttin ' up ? You 're puttin ' up words !
LOWELL: Words ! While you 've been dickin ' around at fucking company golf tournaments , I
WIGAND: I said I 'd call the kids before they went to bed . Onisa
LOWELL: The stringer was supposed to be shooting B-roll on street cops in New Orleans . What 's with all the horses ?
TONY BALDO: Camera guy 's got a thing about mounted police .
LOWELL: Do n't any of these guys ride in cars o walk ?
TONY BALDO: How long did he stay on this ?
LOWELL: What was he seeing ?

DEBBIE DELUCA: I do n't know .
LOWELL: you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on ehalf of the State of Mississippi , did you not ?
RICHARD SCRUGGS: That 's right
LOWELL: Well , I 'm working with someone , now , who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson , a former corporate office there .
RICHARD SCRUGGS: What 's your interest in this , Mr. Bergman ?
LOWELL: Well , he may tape an interview with us . And , we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first , it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection .
MOTLEY: It could work . If it 's public record , it 's public record .
LOWELL: Yeah , and he 's going to need legal epresentation .
MOTLEY: He sure as hell will .
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Has he decided to go public ? Because let me tell you , we 've been doing this for three years now , and we 've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers , so we know Big Tobacco will do everything in their powe to stop him . So , is your man truly committed ?
LOWELL: Well , actually , no . Well , he 's on the fence . That 's the point .
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Well , we 'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance , but without knowing what he 's going to do
LOWELL: Well , would you want him to call you ? Or , you want to call him ? How do you want to do it ?
RICHARD SCRUGGS: It would be better if he called us .
LOWELL: Yeah .
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Alright ?
LOWELL: Okay . Thank you .
DEBBIE DELUCA: I do n't know what he was thinking .
LOWELL: Oh , for God 's sake , what has this guy got , a horse fetish ?
DEBBIE DELUCA: Alright , alright .
LOWELL: Get me to New Orleans this afternoon . I 'll shoot the fucking thing myself !
DEBORAH: What are you cooking ?
LIANE: I 'm cooking pasta primavera .
DEBORAH: Oh , I love that stuff .
LIANE: I 'm going to have to go downstairs .
LOWELL: What happened ?
COP: Dispatch received a call of shots fired in the area . Uniforms arrived on the scene and found this white male subject shot to death .
LOWELL: Was it gang related ?
COP: There 's no indication as far as a tag o an advertisement
LOWELL: Excuse me . Yeah
WIGAND: They 're terrorizing us . Death threats ? ! To my family ? My kids ? !
LOWELL: Jeff , call the FBI right away
WIGAND: They do this with impunity !
LOWELL: Jeff
WIGAND: They get to go home at night . What does it cost these people to do this to us ? Nothing ? ! My girls are crying , so fuck them ! I want to tape ! I 'm done thinking about it .
LOWELL: Good . But Jeff
WIGAND: I 'll call them , Lowell .
LIANE: I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you did n't shut the `` F '' up , they were going to kill you
WIGAND: You ca n't take that It 's personal property !
LOWELL: I 'm telling you , your agents in that office are acting improperly ! Now , who are they trying to protect ?
BILL ROBERTSON: I 'll give it a look .
LOWELL: You 're getting my drift ?
BILL ROBERTSON: I 'll give it a look . He hangs up .
LOWELL: So , is everything okay ?
MIKE WALLACE: How are the rooms ? Comfortable ?
LIANE: Yes , very . You know , I enjoy your work so muchwhen you 're talking to somebody , I always feel like I 'm right there . And she laughs
MIKE WALLACE: Thank you got saying that
LOWELL: Do you think we could talk about the taping ? Tomorrow 's taping , just so we can get it out of the way and order
MIKE WALLACE: Yeah , well , questions will go toward what work you did there , why you were fired . And others will deal
LIANE: taping ? What are you taping ?
WIGAND: I 'm doing an interview .
LIANE: An interview ! Do you know what they will do to us ! I thought Sorry .
LOWELL: Liane , this is a preliminary You did n't tell her we were taping ? What did she think she was coming to New York for ?
WIGAND: to talk about it . To think about it . I had a plan to ease her into it . But , I eally - I did n't know how to do that Jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby Bar .
LOWELL: Oh , man .
MIKE WALLACE: Who are these people ?
LOWELL: Ordinary people ! Under extraordinary < /u pressure , Mike . What the hell do you expect ? Grace and consistency ?
MIKE WALLACE: You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was u > not addictive ?
WIGAND: I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully .
WIGAND: Part of the reason I 'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated , at least within Brown & Williamson 's representation , clearly u > misstatedwhat is common language within the companywe are in the nicotine delivery business .
MIKE WALLACE: And that 's what cigarettes are for ?
WIGAND: A delivery device for nicotine .
MIKE WALLACE: A delivery device for nicotine . Put it in your mouth , light it up , and you 're gon na get your fix
WIGAND: You 're gon na get your fix
MIKE WALLACE: You 're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix , not by artificially adding nicotine , but y enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia
WIGAND: The process is known as `` impact oosting '' While not spiking nicotine , they clearly manipulate it . There 's extensive use of this technology , know as `` ammonia chemistry . '' It allows fo the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the ain and central nervous system .
MIKE WALLACE: And you sent the document forward to Sandefur ?
WIGAND: I sent the document forward to Sandefur . I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute , we were n't going to emove it as it would impact sales , and that that was his decision .
MIKE WALLACE: In other words , you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations u > consciously
WIGAND: Most certainly .
MIKE WALLACE: And on March 24 , Thomas Sandefur , CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired . And the reason he gave you ?
WIGAND: Poor communication skills .
MIKE WALLACE: And , do you wish you had n't come forward ? You wish you had n't blown the whistle ?
WIGAND: Yeah , there are times I wish I had n't done it . There are times I feel compelled to do it . If you asked me would I do it again ? Do I think it 's worth it ? Yeah , I think it 's worth it .
KIDS: Hi .

CHARLENE: He 's on line three .
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Hello .
WIGAND: Mr. Scruggs , Jeff Wigand . Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call
RICHARD SCRUGGS: My co-counsel , Ron Motley , and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness . If you 'd be interested in talking to us , we 'd certainly like to talk to you
WIGAND: When should we do this ?
LOWELL: It 's okay , Jeff .

WIGAND: Can we talk about this when I get back ?
LIANE: YesJeffrey .
THE MAN: Jeff ?
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Now , what this one is , is a temporary estraining order , a gag order , issued by a Kentucky court .
MICHAEL MOORE: Good to meet you , Dr. Wigand .
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Mike 's our Attorney General down here . I was just explaining to Jeff , they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today .
MICHAEL MOORE: Right .
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Now , they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it , but the judge threw it out However , for you , there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order
MICHAEL MOORE: Dr. Wigand , you do understand what could happen , do n't you ?
WIGAND: I 'm not free to testifyhere ?
MOTLEY: That 's right . If you violate the Kentucky order , when you step foot back in Kentucky , they can find you in contempt and they can incarcerate you . And you ought to know that .
WIGAND: Jail ?
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Possibly , yes . That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today . That 's right
WIGAND: How does one '' gotojail ? '' What does my family do ? Go on welfare ? If my wife has to work ? Who 's going to look after the kids ? Put food on the table ? My children need me . If I 'm not teachingthere 's no medicalno medicaleven on co-pay , that 's like Tuition
MICHAEL MOORE: Dr. Wigand , listen , you may not be able to do this thing . As I understand from Dick , you 're our key witness . And , I hope you do n't withdraw . I guess we 'd all understand if you did Guys , I 've got to go . I 'm gon na be late for court . I 'll see y'all a little later . Dr. Wigand , good luck .
RICHARD SCRUGGS: I know what you 're facing , Jeff . And , I think I know how you 're feeling
LOWELL: You attract a crowd .
WIGAND: Yeah , great .
LOWELL: I heard about the Kentucky gag order
WIGAND: I do n't know what to do .
TOBACCO LAWYER: Hold on a second Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he expects his witness to appear or not ? JR. LAWYER crosses to Motley .
WIGAND: I ca n't seem to findthe criteria to decide . It 's too big a decision to make without being resolvedin my own mind .
LOWELL: Maybe things have changed
WIGAND: What 's changed ?
LOWELL: You meansince this morning ?
WIGAND: No . I mean since whenever
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Dr. Wigand would like to leave now .
MOTLEY: Okay , Jeff , I 'm going to sit you down at that table over there . I 'm going to start as fast as possible . I do n't want to give them a chance to get anothe estraining order , okay ? Let 's go .
MICHAEL MOORE: Good luck , Doc .
STENOGRAPHER: Please stand . Raise your right hand Do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you God ?
WIGAND: I do .
STENOGRAPHER: You may be seated .
MOTLEY: You understand , Dr. Wigand , you are unde oath . This is a sworn deposition . There 's no judge . It 's not a trial . Will you state your name for the record .
WIGAND: Jeffrey S. Wigand . He spells it for them
PHOTOGRAPHER: Got any idea what 's going on in there ?
LOWELL: No , I do n't have a clue .
WIGAND: That is correct .
MOTLEY: In other words , it acts as a drug ?
TOBACCO LAWYER: Object to the form of the question !
MOTLEY: It acts as a drug on the body ?
TOBACCO LAWYER: Object to the form !
MOTLEY: It acts as a
TOBACCO LAWYER: Object !
MOTLEY: There an echo in here ? Your objection 's een recorded . She typed it into he little machine over there . It 's on the ecord . So now I 'll proceed with my
TOBACCO LAWYER: Dr. Wigand . I am instructing you not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company . And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary estraining order that has been entered
MOTLEY: Oh , you got rights and lefts ! Ups and downs and middles ! So what ? ! You do n't get to instruct anything around here ! This is not North Carolina , not South Carolina nor Kentucky . This is the sovereign State of Mississippi 's proceeding . Wipe that smirk off you face ! Dr. Wigand 's deposition will be part of this record . And I 'm going to take my witness ' testimony ! Whether the hell you like it or not ! Answer the question , Dr
WIGAND: Yes . It produces a physiological esponse , which meets the definition of a drug ! Nicotine is associated with impact , with satisfaction . It has a pharmacological effect that crosses the lood-brain barrier intact
MOTLEY: Thank you , Doctor . Thank you .
WIGAND: `` Part of the reason I 'm here is I felt that their representation clearly , at least within ''
LOWELL: Run that Sandefur piece on `` nicotine 's not addictive . '' Run that on-camera . Then cut right to Wigand with `` I believe they perjured '' Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath . Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word `` felt '' on the B-side
BILL FELLING: helluva show , Mike . Explosive material .
LOWELL: It went great in Mississippi , Mike .
MIKE WALLACE: Good .
DON HEWITT: I heard Wigand 's deposition got sealed .
LOWELL: Yeah , they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of `` Kools '' to the world . `` Sealed '' does n't hurt Scruggs ' litigation , and since we 're the only ones with the story , I believe we 're sitting on an exclusive .
MIKE WALLACE: I like that
DON HEWITT: Corporate has some questions . We 've got a meeting at Black Rock first thing in the morning .
LOWELL: When 's the air date ?
DEBBIE DELUCA: Excuse me , Lowell . Sharon 's on line 3 .
LOWELL: Tell her I 'll call her back in ten .
BALDO: Here we go .
HELEN CAPERELLI: Shall I send for coffee ? Sorry I 'm late .
MIKE WALLACE: No , no , we 're fine
HELEN CAPERELLI: Are you sure ?
DON HEWITT: Interfering ? That 's what we do .
LOWELL: I think what we 're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time . This is a news organization . People are always telling us things they should n't . We have to verify if it 's true and in the public interest And if it is , we ai it .
MIKE WALLACE: After we corroborate it . That 's why we 've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show . Anything else ?
DON HEWITT: Why ? You think we have liability ? What 's the CBS News ' position , Eric ?
ERIC KLUSTER: There 's a possibility , it 's rathe emote
HELEN CAPERELLI: But one we have to check on , Mike . I 've etained outside counsel to do exactly that . On a segment , I might add , that 's already rife with problems
LOWELL: What does that mean ? `` Rife with ? ''
HELEN CAPERELLI: I 'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand .
LOWELL: No , only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him
HELEN CAPERELLI: And , I 'm told there are questions as to our `` star witness ' '' veracity .
LOWELL: His `` veracity '' was good enough for the State of Mississippi .
HELEN CAPERELLI: Our standards have to be higher than anyone else 's , because we are the standardfor everyone else Whatever that means
LOWELL: Well , as a `` standard '' I 'll hang with `` is the guy telling the truth ? ''
HELEN CAPERELLI: Well , with tortious interference , I 'm afraidthe greater the truth , the greater the damage .
LOWELL: Come again ?
LOWELL: Is this `` Alice in Wonderland '' ?
MIKE WALLACE: You said `` on this one . '' What about `` this one '' ?
HELEN CAPERELLI: If this holds up , and it very well may not , Mikebut , if it did . And we aired this segment ? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson ? I think we could be at grave risk .
MIKE WALLACE: How grace ?
HELEN CAPERELLI: Well , at the end of the daybecause of your segmentthe Brown & Williamson Tobacco Companycould own CBS .
LOWELL: Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story ?
HELEN CAPERELLI: You 're getting ahead of yourself . We 're
LOWELL: `` Tortious interference '' ? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio .
DON HEWITT: Lunch ?
MIKE WALLACE: Sure . Do n't worry , we call the shots around here .
LOWELL: Debbie , it 's me . I want you to check some filings and give me John Wilson 's number at Bear-Stern .
DON HEWITT: Kluster 's coming over .
ERIC KLUSTER: Hello , Lowell , Mike , Don . Hewitt hangs up the phone .
LOWELL: So , what happened to Ms. Caperelli 's checking with outside counsel first , all that crap ?
ERIC KLUSTER: That 's happening . And , hopefully we wo n't have to use the alternate , but we should have it in the can .
LOWELL: I 'm not touching my film
ERIC KLUSTER: I 'm afraid you are .
LOWELL: No , I 'm not
ERIC KLUSTER: We 're doing this with or without you , Lowell . If you like , I can assign another producer to edit your show
LOWELL: Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on `` 60 Minutes '' ?
DON HEWITT: It 's an alternate version . So what if we have an alternate version ? And I do n't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable .
ERIC KLUSTER: So , now , if you 'll excuse me , gentlemen , Mr. Rather 's been complaining about his chair again . As they start to leave
LOWELL: Before you go And Lowell takes out
MIKE WALLACE: What ?
DON HEWITT: Yeah , I heard rumors .
LOWELL: It 's not a rumor . It 's a sale . If Tisch can unload CBS for $ 81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dolla lawsuit from Brown & Williamson , that could screw up the sale , could it not ?
ERIC KLUSTER: And what are you implying ?
LOWELL: I 'm not implying . I 'm quoting . More vested interests `` Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger Ms. Helen Caperelli , General Counsel of CBS News , 3.9 million . Mr. Eric Kluster , President of CBS News , 1.4 million ''
DON HEWITT: Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money ?
LOWELL: Oh , no , of course they 're not influenced y money . They work for free . And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer .
DON HEWITT: CBS does not do that . And , you 're questioning our journalistic integrity ? !
LOWELL: No , I 'm questioning your hearing ! You hear `` reasonable '' and `` tortious interference . '' I hear `` Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse . '' I hear `` Shut the segment down . Cut Wigand loose . Obey orders . And fuck off ! '' That 's what I hear .
DON HEWITT: You 're exaggerating !
LOWELL: I am ? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand , to draw him out . To get him to trust us , to get him to go on television . I do . I deliver him . He sits . He talks . He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement . And he 's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue , maybe the biggest , most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history . And Jeffrey Wigand , who 's out on a limb , does he go on television and tell the truth ? Yes . Is it newsworthy ? Yes . Are we gon na ai it ? Of course not . Why ? Because he 's not telling the truth ? No . Because he u > is telling the truth . That 's why we 're not going to air it . And the more truth he tells , the worse it gets !
DON HEWITT: You are a fanatic . An anarchist . You know that ? If we ca n't have a whole show , then I want half a show rather than no show . But oh , no , not you . You wo n't e satisfied unless you 're putting the company at risk !
LOWELL: C'mon , what are you ? And are you a usinessman ? Or are you a newsman ? ! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living
MIKE WALLACE: Lowell .
LOWELL: `` Put the corporation at risk '' ? Give me a fucking break !
MIKE WALLACE: Lowell .
MIKE WALLACE: Lowell !
LOWELL: What ?
MIKE WALLACE: I 'm with Don on this . And there it is .
SHARON: What 's wrong ?
LOWELL: They 're killing the Wigand interview
SHARON: What ? !
LOWELL: They 're pretending it 's process . Bullshit , it 's foregone .
SHARON: What are you and Mike going to do ?
LOWELL: I 'm alone on this
SHARON: Oh , baby
LOWELL: Jeffrey
WIGAND: There is - there is no family .
LOWELL: I do n't know how to say this , Jeff , except to just say it right out , so I 'll say it . They do not want to air it .
WIGAND: What ? !
LOWELL: B & W may have threatened litigation CBS is on the block But you , I mean , I know how
WIGAND: No .
LOWELL: No ? No , what ?
WIGAND: I do not think that you `` know '' fo mewhat it is to walk in my shoes for my kids to have seen itfor them to know why I 've put them through what I didthe public airing of thatthe testament to why I did what I didyou 're telling me is not going to see the light of day .
LOWELL: Jeff And Jeffrey hangs up .
THE WOMAN: It has n't been Mrs. Wigand for some time .
SUSAN WIGAND: seven months after we were married we found out that I had multiple sclerosis
JOHN SCANLON: come on , Tommy Sandefur told me himself , he 's not gon na allow Brown & Williamson to be demonized to the American public , so I told Peter Jennings and Ihold on He stops , listening to the videotape
SUSAN WIGAND: Yes But you have to understand , the divorce was something that we both wanted
JOHN SCANLON: He 's a total bullshit artist . He 's a shoplifter . He 's a convicted shoplifter .
DON HEWITT: So , what are you going to do ?
LOWELL: Well , what do you think I 'm going to do ? Quit in protest ? I 'm not going to do that .
DON HEWITT: You 're taking `` no '' for an answer ?
LOWELL: No . I 'm not going to take `` no '' for an answer . No .
DON HEWITT: Then what are you going to do ? Hewitt looks at him
LOWELL: I 'm staying right here . Doing my job . Fighting to get my show on the air . You do n't like it ? Hey , I 'll tell you whatfire my ass
DON HEWITT: End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell , the First Amendment martyr ? I do n't think so . Take a look at this This is a summary of a dossier that 's being prepared . And he gives him a copy of it .
DEBBIE DELUCA: What was that about ?
LOWELL: Get me Wigand .
DEBBIE DELUCA: Sure .
LOWELL: fuck is this ? Fuck !
WIGAND: Well , how is that any of your business ? ! That is not something that you people need to know ! His voice carries , a student looks over
WIGAND: What do you want to do , Lowell , look up my ass , too !
LOWELL: Oh , my God .
WIGAND: I told the truth !
WIGAND: I was young . I was youngconfused We did n't handle it the right way
LOWELL: She sued you for back payments of child support ?
WIGAND: She did not sue me . We had a dispute over money I settled it , she dropped the complaint Any other questions ? And we 'll go back and forth
LOWELL: Yes . Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics ?
WIGAND: What ?
LOWELL: Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interviewwhere you 're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics ?
LOWELL: Alrightthe ABC Telemarketing Company ?
WIGAND: ABC ?
LOWELL: ABC Telemarketing Company .
WIGAND: A can opener ! A $ 39.95 can opener . I cancelled payment It was junk . You ever bounce a check , Lowell ? You ever look at another woman 's tits ? You ever cheat a little on your taxes ? Whose life , if you look at it under a microscope , does n't have any flaws ?
WIGAND: What does this have to do with my testimony ?
LOWELL: That 's not the point .
WIGAND: What does this have to do with my testimony ? ! I told the truth ! It 's valid and true and provable !
LOWELL: That 's not the fucking point , whether you told the truth or not ! Hello ?
WIGAND: I told the truth I told the truth .
LOWELL: And I 've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs . I am trying to protect you , man ! Wigand 's quiet .
WIGAND: Well , I hope you improve your batting average .
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: Hello ?
LOWELL: Well , are you or are you not , Charlie ?
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: You bet we are . And I ca n't talk to you now .
LOWELL: We got ta hook up .
CHARLIE PHILLIPS: Sure . Where ?

It 's Terry Lenzner 's outfit , IGI . Jack , listen to me . Their strategy discredit this guy , uin his reputation in The Wall Street Journal , and then nobody will ever listen to what he 's got to say about tobacco . He 's dead . Unless I can get this thing knocked down .
SANDRA SUTHERLAND: Is there any truth to any of it ?
LOWELL: That 's a good question . `` Is there any truth to any of it ? '' I doubt it .

CHARLIE PHILLIPS: Well , it 's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented .

LOWELL: What does it look like I 'm doing ? I 'm editing .
DON HEWITT: No , not that . I 'm talking about the Associated Press . They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I . Did you tell them that we were lying ?

MIKE WALLACE: Do me a favor , will you ? Spare me , fo God 's sake . Get in the real world . What do you think ? I 'm going to resign in protest ? To force it on the air ? The answer is `` no . '' I do n't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio . That decision I 've already made .
VOICE: It just started , Mike
ERIC KLUSTER: It was a time consideration , Mike

WIGAND: `` Up to you , Jeffrey . That 's the powe you have , Jeffrey . Vital inside information the American public need to know . '' Lowell Bergman , the hot show who never met a source he could n't turn around .

MIKE WALLACE: Oh , how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman 's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path . To show me the way .
LOWELL: Oh , please , Mike
MIKE WALLACE: Give me a break !
MIKE WALLACE: In the real world , when you get to where
LOWELL: Like what ? Corporate responsibility ? What , are we talking celebrity here ?

I did Iran-Gate and the Ayatollah , Malcolm X , Martin Luther King , Saddam , Sadat , etcetera , etcetera . I showed them thieves in suits . I 've spent a lifetime building all that . But history only remembers most what you did last . And should that be fronting a segment that allowed a tobacco giant to crash this network ? Does it give someone at my time of life pause ? Yeah .

RENAI: You are a little kid .
FOSTER: I need a bowl , mom .
RENAI: Billing department .
FOSTER: It 's too small .
RENAI: Make it work .
JOSH: Every time I think I 've pulled you outyou grow back in . He plucks it out , wincing melodramatically .
RENAI: Well , I 'd like to keep the old number if I could .
TO JOSH: You really need to learn how to do this , honey . She threads the tie into a knot for him .
JOSH: Do n't eat on the floor , buddy .
RENAI: Okay , well , please let me know by the end of today , I have to give the number out . Thank you .
JOSH: How come you were up so early ? Was Cali crying ?
RENAI: You woke me up .
JOSH: What do you mean ?
RENAI: You were snoring .
JOSH: No I was n't .
RENAI: Yes you were .
JOSH: I do n't snore .
RENAI: Yes you do .
JOSH: My father snored . I do not snore .
RENAI: How would you know what you do ? You 're asleep .
DALTON: Yes ! I made it to the last level ! Invisiworld ! Ever amiable , Josh high five 's his son .
JOSH: Good one , champ .
BEAT: I do n't snore , do I ?
RENAI: Where are my bleeping pills ?
JOSH: What the heck is this ? Wax ? !
RENAI: Yes .
JOSH: Let me get this straight - we have no actual fruit but we have wax fruit ?
RENAI: Yes .
JOSH: That is dangerous . It could kill one of our kids .
RENAI: Where are my pills , Josh ?
JOSH: Probably where you left them , Renai .
RENAI: That 's not where I left them .
DALTON: Mom , I need my lunch .
RENAI: Oh , geez . Look , justtake last night 's dinner .
DALTON: Sushi ? Aw , that 's weirdo food .
RENAI: It 's all we have . Just for today , honey .
JOSH: Check it first , Dalton . It 's probably made out of Styrofoam .
RENAI: And while I 've got you , if you 're going to look at my books , please do n't leave them all over the floor .
DALTON: I did n't touch your books .
JOSH: I got ta go .
RENAI: Are you taking the boys to school ?
JOSH: No time .
RENAI: Well can you pick them up afte school ?
JOSH: Not today .
RENAI: But I have stuff I wanted to
FOSTER: Can I have another cup , mom ?
JOSH: Alanso , please sit down .
ALANSO: No entiendo .
JOSH: Siéntate , por favor .
TERI: You better all shut up .
JOSH: Thank you , Teri . Today we are going to talk about Darwin . It 's a city in Australia , but it 's also the last name of which famous naturalist ?
ALANSO: I know I did n't evolve from no monkey . Shit .
JOSH: Humans actually have a lot in common with monkeys , or more specifically , chimpanzees .
ALANSO: Maybe you do , but I was created in the image of my Dios .
JOSH: I respect your right to believe that , Alanso . But I want to give you all possible theories . I want this class to go out into the world with an informed opinion .
ALANSO: The theory is incorrect , Mr. Lambert .
JOSH: How can it be incorrect ? It 's a theory . A scientific theory .
ALANSO: Yeah , well , science is bullshit . We did n't get here cos of no test-tubes .
JOSH: Alanso , if you keep talking like that I 'm going to ask you to visit the principal .
ALANSO: Fine .
RENAI: Yeah , I 'm looking west , always been looking that way , gon na get it all happening , just ca n't do it today
SINGING: Yeah , I 'm looking west , always been looking that way , I 'm gon na be somebody , I just ca n't be her today
JOSH: Look at this . Nice job .
RENAI: Josh , where 's the box of my lamps ?
JOSH: I do n't know . They should be here . We packed them up .
RENAI: Yeah , I packed them . They 're not here .
JOSH: I remember the movers bringing them in and putting them right there .
PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE: Well , they 're not here . I would know , I 've been unpacking this stuff all day .
RENAI: Dalton ? Where are you ? He does n't answer . Just keeps screaming .
JOSH: What happened ?
DALTON: I fell .
RENAI: Dalton , you have to be careful . You should n't be coming down here in the dark .
JOSH: Where do you hurt the most ?
DALTON: My knee and my head . I ca n't stand up .
JOSH: You scared us , champ .
RENAI: If I catch you falling down the stairs again I 'm gon na break you neck .
DALTON: That does n't make sense .
RENAI: Sleep tight , honey . They wave goodbye and turn out the light .
JOSH: We 've got ta lock that door .
RENAI: He 's such a boy . He goes off exploring . Sometimes I wan na keep him on one of those child leashes .
JOSH: Why bother with a child leash ? I 'll stop at the pet store tomorrow .
RENAI: I 'm sorry I was pissy when you got home . I was trying to work on a song today and then Cali woke up and would n't stop crying
JOSH: I did n't even notice .
RENAI: I feel guilty for wanting my own time .
JOSH: It 's normal to want your own time .
RENAI: Is it ? My mother gave up everything for me . I keep waiting for the completely selfless parent gene to kick in , but I 'm exactly the same person I was when I was 22 , only now I 'm married with kids .
JOSH: You 're a great mother .
RENAI: No , I 'm not . They like you so much etter than me .
JOSH: That 's not true .
RENAI: You 're the cool dad who comes home with presents and I 'm the one who yells at them all day .
JOSH: Now you 're being crazy . They love you . At least you get to connect with them . I work so much .
RENAI: Believe me , you 're their hero . They try to play us off against each other . They 're master manipulators . I guess they really are my kids . Josh laughs . A lull settles over them .
JOSH: Is this so bad ?
RENAI: Thank you for letting me take some time off to work on my music again .
JOSH: We 'll get by . I want you to do it .
RENAI: There 's a couple of songsI mean not all of them , but there 's a couple of them that I think are eally good . And I think , maybe I could do something with them .
JOSH: I love all your songs . They kiss .
RENAI: Foster , sit down honey . She whips a look around .
JOSH: Time to get up , my man . Come on .
DR. SERCARZ: Okayas of yet , our tests have not drawn any conclusive answers for you . Repeated blood and CSF cultures are normal , making an infective origin highly unlikely . Tests for Lyme disease and repeated polymerase chain reaction are negative . Systemic vasculitis was uled out . Dalton remains in an areactive coma without focal signs or abnormal brainstem reflexes .
MORE: 22 .
JOSH: Sothere 's no brain damage or ?
DR. SERCARZ: None that we 've detected . Technically , he 's in a coma . He does n't respond to stimuli , he has no sleep-wake cycle , but there 's no brain trauma or infection . His scans are normal . To be honest , I 've never seen anything like it .
JOSH: That fall he tookI mean , it looked like he hit his head pretty hard .
DR. SERCARZ: We definitely exhausted that possibility , but it was always doubtful . The cut was superficial , there was n't even a skull fracture .
RENAI: He ca n't just not wake upthere 's got to be something
DR. SERCARZ: I 'm sorry .
JOSH: So what do we do now ? Does he stay here ?
DR. SERCARZ: We 'll conduct some further testing , but eyond thatI really do n't know .
ADELE: Are you having any more trouble with the feeding tube ?
RENAI: It 's okay .
ADELE: Alright , well I 'll be back soon . I 'll bring some new books . You 're probably sick of the ones you have .
RENAI: Did he respond to any of the tests ? Adele pauses .
ADELE: Nono , he did n't . But we have to give it time . I 've seen coma patients with a much longe inactivity time suddenly start making noises .
RENAI: He 's not in a coma , remember ? They do n't know what to call it . They do n't know what to do with him so they 've given up .
ADELE: No , they have n't . We 're going to figure it out .
VOICE: They see usall of uswe have to be quickthis life begs us to come back . The whisper trails off.more static
FROM MONITOR: NOOOOOOOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! !
CALI: Dadda ! Josh looks up , smiling . Amazed .
JOSH: She said dad Neither Renai nor Foster even look up .
RENAI: What 's this ?
FOSTER: An award .
RENAI: That 's today 's date . You got this today ? Foster nods meekly .
FOSTER: I 'm scared , mom .
RENAI: Scared of what ?
FOSTER: Dalton . Renai sits back down .
RENAI: We 're all scared . It 's normal to be scared for him . But we ca n't give up
FOSTER: Why do I have to sleep so close to him ? Ca n't I change rooms ?
RENAI: Why would you wan na change rooms ? Foster swallows .
FOSTER: I do n't know .
RENAI: Your brother needs you . Goodnight honey .
JOSH: What ?
RENAI: I heard something coming from Cali 's room . A man 's voice . On the aby monitorit scared the hell outta me . I went in there and no one was there .
JOSH: Could it have been interference ?
RENAI: I do n't know . It was so clear . I was sitting at the piano and I heard thiswhispering on the baby monitor . So I held my ear up to it
JOSH: Who the hell is that ?
RENAI: Who was it , Josh ?
JOSH: What did you say ?
RENAI: There 's someone in there ! She RUNS towards Josh .
JOSH: Grab Cali and Foster ! Josh charges down the hall into the
RENAI: Josh ! The laundry !
SECURITY OFFICER: There 's no one in there , it 's all clear . If someone was there , they 're gone now .
RENAI: I saw somebody .
SECURITY OFFICER: Maybe it was a shadow ?
RENAI: No . It was n't a shadow , it was a man . He was tall , and he long , greasy hair . He was wearing a grey jacket . He looked right at me .
SECURITY OFFICER: Well , like I saidhe 's gone now .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay , face the front ladies and gentlemencome onhold still I 'm trying to record the peak of your pathetic lives here .
JOSH: Uhwhat ?
PHOTOGRAPHER: Could you step in so that we can take the photo ? Quickly please .
JOSH: Just take it without me .
PHOTOGRAPHER: We need you in the photo , sir .
JOSH: No , you do n't . Just take the damn photo without me , okay ?
PHOTOGRAPHER: I ca n't believe this is my life . Ready kids ? Say asshole teacher !
JOSH: What ?
ALANSO: I spend so much time in the office , I hear things . I heard about you son . I 'm sorry .
JOSH: Thank you , Alanso .
ALANSO: Times like thesepeople realize that science does n't have all the answers . There is a higher force at work .
JOSH: I wish I had your belief . Things would be a lot simpler .
ALANSO: Things are simple . You just ca n't see it . Put your faith in Him .
JOSH: HeyI just found out I have to stay back tonight and finish off mid-term grades . It could be a while , there 's a lot to go through . Do n't wait up . Bye .
KELLY: You okay ?
RENAI: Yeah .
KELLY: I was going to head off for an hou or so . Are you alright here ?
RENAI: Of course . Anything from Dalton ?
KELLY: No . I 'm sorry .
RENAI: I wo n't , I justI have n't slept much the last couple of nights . I feel like the universe is trying to see how far I can bend before I eak .
KELLY: The universe picked a fight with the wrong chick .
RENAI: Thanks , Kelly . You 're a saint .
KELLY: No , I 'm not . I 'm doing my job . I chose to be here . You did n't choose any of this . You 're the strong one .
JOSH: What are you doing up ?
RENAI: It 's midnight , Josh .
JOSH: When did you start smoking ?
RENAI: You 've been coming home late every single night . You 've never had to do that in all of the years you 've een at the school . Now all of a sudden you have to stay back late ?
JOSH: I do n't like it either , but I 'm grading tests . What choice do I have ? We 've got ta pay Dalton 's bills .
RENAI: Your mother is paying Dalton 's ills , Josh . I know because she eminds me every chance she gets .
JOSH: Jesus , I ca n't win with you . That 's my son in there too , not just yours ! He paces , the anger sobering him .
RENAI: You 're projecting that onto me . You 've written an entire story about I 'm how I 'm feeling without once asking me how I 'm feeling .
JOSH: I do n't need to ask . I know you .
RENAI: I am losing my mind here in this house , Josh . I 'm scared and I need you and you 're not here . Where are you ?
JOSH: I told you , I 'm grading tests .
RENAI: I do n't mean that . I mean you 're not here . With me . In this situation . You 're avoiding it , like you do anything stressful , whethe it 's this or a parking ticket .
JOSH: Christ , I should have stayed at the school .
RENAI: There you go again .
MAN: DO N'T YOU FUCKING DARE !
JOSH: What is it ? What is it ? !
RENAI: The man he was there he tried to there was a man there ! ! !
JOSH: There 's no one here .
RENAI: I saw somebody !
JOSH: There 's no one here .
RENAI: Do n't you dare not believe me !
JOSH: I believe you , okay ? I just do n't know what you want me to do .
RENAI: I want you to tell me that we can leave this house . I will not spend one more night here . I wan na leave , I wan na go !
FOSTER: I do n't want the man to get me .
JOSH: You 're okay , buddy . I 've got you . He and Renai exchange a look .
RENAI: I 'm sorry .
BEAT: I can'tI want to leave this house . I ca n't be here anymore .
JOSH: To move now would bewe would have to rent somewhere . It 's not
RENAI: Please , Josh . An agreement passes between them .
LORRAINE: Nonsense . I 'm perfectly capable of putting a few things away . I did it for Josh his whole life . He neve was good with tidying up .
RENAI: I know , but I just feel so bad .
LORRAINE: I think it 's you who should be sitting down by the looks of it .
RENAI: I ca n't believe we 're doing all this again , that 's what I ca n't believe . I know you think I 'm crazy .
LORRAINE: Nobody - not me , not anybody - knows what you 're going through ight now . Whatever you have to do to get through it , do it . And neve apologize for it .
RENAI: We just wan na saythank you so much . For helping us out with this , doctor . We ca n't tell you how much it means to have you involved .
DR. TRIMBLE: I 'm glad to help .
BEAT: Unfortunatelythese recent tests have proven inconclusive . There 's absolutely nothing abnormal here . Josh and Renai deflate .
JOSH: Soif you 're the top of the food chain with this stuff , where does that leave us ?
DR. TRIMBLE: I do n't know . There is a research team in Boston who specialize in a new form of treatment . They try to stimulate the patients brain with electric pulses . It has a good success rate with victims of brain injury . We could try that .
RENAI: So there 's hope ?
DR. TRIMBLE: There are more things we can try .
BEAT: The hope part is up to you .
FROM RECORD: Tip-toe by the window , by the window , that is where I 'll be
TINY TIM: Oh tip-toe , from the garden , by the garden , of the willow tree Renai passes the living room .
THEN: SHE HEARS it Giggling .
RENAI: Oh my God , Daltonno
NED: Joshdid n't see you there .
JOSH: Sorry to scare you .
NED: What are you up to this late ?
JOSH: Where did all the bartenders who listen to your troubles go , Ned ?
NED: Never drink alone . If you take the dirty jokes out of drunkenness , all you 're left with is the self loathing .
JOSH: I do n't need whisky for that .
NED: Bah . You people think too much . Used to be , if life threw a shitstorm at you , you 'd grab the nearest umbrella . Your generation would spend a day googling what and to buy . Josh laughs despite himself .
JOSH: I probably would too . It 's funny , I 've always known I was the type of person that things did n't happen to . I made peace with it . I thought to myself , it 's okay - I 'll never win the lottery or clim Mount Everestbut I 'll never get a rare tropical blood disease either . It works out .
BEAT: Now I 'm the guy whose son is in a mysterious coma .
NED: Things happen to everybody . Even to good people like you . And they 're gon na keep happening the older you get , believe me . No use sittin ' in the dark drinkin ' over it . Go home . Be with your wife . Tell her you what 's on your mind . He takes the flask and has another swig .
JOSH: This is the first line of a joke . Guy comes home to find his wife with a priest Father Nathanson stands , as does Renai .
RENAI: Josh , this is Liam Nathanson . A very old friend of mine .
FATHER NATHANSON: Nice to meet you . I 've heard a lot about you .
JOSH: Ca n't say I 've heard the same , Liam . At least I know you 're not sleeping with her .
FATHER NATHANSON: I should be going . Thank you so much for the tea .
RENAI: Thanks , Liam .
JOSH: Okay , would anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on here ?
LORRAINE: Please sit down , Joshua .
JOSH: `` Joshua ? '' Oh Jesus
LORRAINE: Sit down .
JOSH: The melodramatic way in which you two are conducting yourselves right now is scaring the shit out of me , so just tell me what 's wrong .
LORRAINE: Nothing is wrong . We want to talk .
JOSH: Nobody asks you to sit down unless something is wrong . If a docto calls you into his office and asks you to sit down , you 're fucked .
RENAI: There 's no use , Lorraine . He 's been drinking .
JOSH: I have not been drinking . Not enough that we ca n't talk to each other , Renai . And do n't judge me in that bitchy tone , okay ?
RENAI: He would never speak to me like that before .
JOSH: Christ . You 're acting like I 'm some lush who comes home and beats you with a belt . At least I 'm speaking to you . You suddenly have to speak to a priest . Or my mother who , up until a couple of weeks ago , you could n't stand .
RENAI: You 're an asshole .
LORRAINE: Your wife needs you . Now sit down and listen to her . I wo n't ask you again .
RENAI: Thisthing that was in the othe house . It followed us . Josh shifts in his seat . Agitated .
LORRAINE: Let her speak .
RENAI: I saw someone again today . In the house . It looked like a young boy . I followed it into Dalton 's room ut it was n't a child .
BEAT: This thing is here . I know it .
JOSH: Sowhat ? You called in a priest to get rid of it ?
RENAI: I did n't know what else to do .
JOSH: Are you kidding me ?
TO LORRAINE: Was this your idea ?
RENAI: No . It was mine .
JOSH: You 've never been to a church in your life . Now you 're inviting a priest into our home ? I feel like I do n't even know you right now .
RENAI: I 'm scared .
JOSH: This is a fantasy , and you need a therapist , not a member of the clergy .
RENAI: I told you
LORRAINE: What 's happening to Renai is real . I 've seen it for myself .
BEAT: I came here today because last night I had a dream about this place .
MORE: 50 .
LORRAINE: I can still hear that voice . She looks up at Josh - and SCREAMS !
JOSH: What is it ? Lorraine stares eerily into his eyes . Frozen .
LORRAINE: He 's here .
RENAI: Help us
JOSH: I do n't know how .
LORRAINE: I know somebody who can helpif you 're willing to ask for it .
SPECS: So you must be Josh ?
JOSH: Yeah .
SPECS: That was n't psychic . Lorraine told me your name .
JOSH: Oh .
SPECS: I 'm Specs . I 'm here to solve your problem . I 'm just kidding with the voice . We take this very seriously .
RENAI: So is Elise coming or ?
SPECS: She wo n't be joining us yet . Usually we handle all the background stuff , then she gets involved when we have the facts .
TUCKER: Helps weed out the nutjobs .
RENAI: Okay
JOSH: This is a little uncomfortable . Speaking for myself . I 'm not used to this kind of stuff .
SPECS: We understand completely . Ninety six per cent of the people we deal with have had no experience with this type of phenomena before . He takes out a notepad and pen .
RENAI: Ahsure .
SPECS: My assistant will check different areas of the house for electrical anomalies . I 'll get him started . Tucker , would you follow me ?
TUCKER: Assistant ?
SPECS: Could you not eat that in front of the clients ?
TUCKER: Assistant ?
SPECS: Finish it in here . This industry gets laughed at enough as it is .
RENAI: No . I mean , our son
SPECS: Right . I heard about this from Lorraine . He is in a coma , the cause of which is unknown ?
RENAI: Yes .
SPECS: Do either of you habitually use drugs or alcohol ?
RENAI: No .
SPECS: No drugs at all ?
RENAI: I take anti-depressants sometimes .
SPECS: Do you have a history of clinical depression ?
RENAI: Not a history . I 've had bouts of it . In the past .
SPECS: Tucker , could you check the camera ?
TUCKER: He handles administration , I handle technical . It 's an even split . He could n't change a light bulb and I 'm no good with paperwork . It bores me senseless . Specs clears his throat , peeved . Continues .
SPECS: Do you have any history of sexual abuse in the family ?
JOSH: No .
BEAT: I 'm sorry , I have to ask how this elates to our problem ?
SPECS: Nine times out of ten , when someone comes to us with a problem like this , it 's because of an inward cause within the family unitnot a physical force outside of it .
JOSH: What is that ?
TUCKER: Tri-field meter . It measures DC fields and the natural electro magnetic environment .
SPECS: Sometimes old wiring can leak into the atmosphere . It can cause hallucinations , changes in energy .
TUCKER: Yeah . It 's a little more complicated than that , but , you know , you get the general idea .
SPECS: It 's basically that .
TUCKER: Not really , but whatever .
SPECS: The tech stuff 's not relevant to you anyway .
TUCKER: It 's very relevant , but it 's all good .
SPECS: Epilepsy in one of the children mostly . It 's very common . If we approach things academically , it lets us find the genuinely interesting cases .
TUCKER: I think we can call Elise now
JOSH: Mrs. Rainier ?
ELISE: No , my mother could n't come , it 's just me . Elise . You must be Lorraine 's son ? You 've grown since I last saw you .
JOSH: Last saw me ?
ELISE: Your mother and I have been friends for a long time .
RENAI: Hi . I 'm Renai .
ELISE: Pleased to meet you . I 'm Elise .
TUCKER: We took Tri-field and EMF readings of the whole house . All the wiring , alarm clocks , radios , toasters , TV , ecord player , fuse box . Nothing went off the charts .
ELISE: And the previous home ? Tucker and Specs look at each other . Oh shit .
SPECS: Tucker had n't monitored that yet . I could jump on that this afternoon if you like ? Make up for lost time .
TUCKER: Yeah , but who would work the equipment ? I 'll need to be there . You know what , do n't even sweat it . I 'll make myself available .
ELISE: No , that 's fine , gentlemen .
RENAI: Yes . Of course .
ELISE: Steven , do you have your sketchbook ?
SPECS: Yes , I do . Yes , I do . Yes , yes . I do .
ELISE: Good . We 're going to need it .
RENAI: What is it for ?
SPECS: She tells me what she sees and I draw it . It 's the most important part of her process .
TUCKER: His drawings and my photos comprise her visual records .
SPECS: Especially the drawings .
TUCKER: That 's debatable .
SPECS: It 's not debatable .
TUCKER: It is , but whatever .
SPECS: Onwards and upwards . Find me a ghost .
RENAI: What is it ?
ELISE: There is something here .
TUCKER: This is where I saw it .
ELISE: long hairgrey dresshe eyes are
JOSH: Go ahead .
ELISE: Maybe you could wait back there ?
SHOULD: BE ABSOLUTE T E R R O R .
RENAI: What is it ? What do you see ?
ELISE: I 'm not sure if you are ready to hear this yetbut unfortunately I ca n't waste any time easing you into it . There is no time left . She takes a deep breath , preparing herself .
RENAI: Go on .
ELISE: Your sonis not in a coma . His physical body is here , but his spiritual body is not .
BEAT: The reason these disturbances followed you to a new home is ecauseit is not the house that is haunted . It is your son .
RENAI: I do n't understand
ELISE: Have you ever heard of astral projection ?
RENAI: Out of body experiences ? Elise nods .
ELISE: I call them travellers . These are people with the ability to leave their physical body and travel to different places in an astral form . To some degree , we all have the ability to do itbut most of us subconsciously suppress it or do n't know how to access it .
RENAI: Lost ? Lost where ?
ELISE: In The Further .
RENAI: What do you mean ?
ELISE: The Further is that place beyond ou perception , beyond our understanding of the physical world that we can see and touch . It is a place without clocks or measurements , without past or futurean infinite realm that holds all of our dreamsand all of our nightmares . She turns to look at them .
RENAI: How many are there ?
ELISE: There are five benevolent spirits . Five different entities for whom Dalton has become a most prized possession . They are trying to get inside his physical bodyand they get closer with each passing day .
BEAT: I do n't want to scare you , but I have never , in all my years of doing this , experienced anything as terrifying as their presence .
RENAI: Is there a way to bring Dalton back ?
ELISE: There is something we could try . A way of calling him back . I would need your complete trust . Josh ca n't take it any more . He stands up .
JOSH: No . No . This has gone too far .
RENAI: You said that you 'd give her a chance !
JOSH: I have given her a chance , and I did that because I wanted to help you . But I can not have somebody telling us that the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul is floating off somewhere in anothe dimension .
ELISE: I know this is hard to hear .
JOSH: No , it 's not fair is what it is . You 're preying on people 's grief and vulnerability , which is really easy to do in a situation like this .
RENAI: Why did we go to all the trouble of inging them here if you 're just going to reject what they say ?
JOSH: Because I wanted to help you . To put your mind at ease , and if this helped , then great . But to drag Dalton into this ? No .
RENAI: Josh , you 're not being fair
JOSH: Fair ? How did the voice of reason ecome the bad guy here ? Do n't you see ? You want to believe . Of course you do , honey , anybody would . The room goes quiet . Josh turns to Elise .
RENAI: You never believed me
JOSH: Honey , I 'm on your side . But I genuinely think this is dangerous and frankly , a little exploitative . He turns to Elise , Specs and Tucker .
SPECS: We reject more cases than we take . We 're not out for money , sir .
JOSH: I know , I knowlook , I appreciate your interest and your time . I do . Thank you . Thank you very much . He goes to the front door , opening it .
ELISE: I completely understand . And I honestly do n't blame you fo eacting like this .
RENAI: No , pleasedo n't go .
ELISE: Thank you for your time . They exit . The door closes . They are gone .
JOSH: Look at me for a second , honey .
BEAT: Look at me . She does n't look up .
RENAI: I do n't know
JOSH: Do you think I do n't want to elieve in that stuff ? Of course I do . It would make life a lot easie if I did . If I believed that some supernatural force was responsible for what 's happened to our son
RENAI: I do n't believe anything anymore , Josh . I used to . I used to believe that I could keep my children safe . I used to believe everything would e okay . To believe in something , you have to know it to be true . She turns and looks at him .
MORE: 66 .
JOSH: Where are you ? Where did you go ?
BEAT: Can you hear me ? I 'm begging you to show me that you can hear meI do n't know how to help you . Please tell me what to do .
JOSH: Okay .
ELISE: What 's most important is that you ealize no two attempts are the same . I will be completely honest with you about the results , and if no dialogue is established , I will tell you . I am not in the business of embellishing success . What happens , happens .
TUCKER: These still cameras are rigged to pick up changes in the atmosphere , electrical or temperature-wise . Do n't e alarmed if they go off .
ELISE: Everything I say while I am in tune will be at a very low volume , so you wo n't hear any of it . Steven will write it down and repeat it for you . Specs waits obediently at her side .
SPECS: We are calling out to you Dalton .
ELISE: Leave this vessel ! Leave this vessel !
RENAI: Dalton !
SPECS: I feel like a mountain climbe who 's been waiting his whole life to climb Everest , and now that I 'm standing on the summit , I do n't know what to do with myself
TUCKER: I 'll tell you what we do with ourselves . We make a short list of our preferred media outlets , that 's what . He holds up his video camera .
SPECS: Oh my God
TUCKER: After all the years we 've been dining out on morsels like a faucet that turns itself on and offwe finally have some empirical evidence of the real thing . Proof .
ELISE: Proof ? Proof of what ? Nine tenths of the world believes that when you die , your soul ascends to sit with God . Would you be telling them something they did n't already know ?
TUCKER: That is so not the point . This is not about religion . Here we have irrefutable evidence of a paranormal experience . Our job is to share it .
ELISE: No , our job is not to alert the press and prove the existence of the ` paranormal ' , as you call it . I 'm not out to prove anything . I 've known there was a higher plane ever since I was a little girl and I could play hopscotch with people whose names were inscribed on tombstones . What you call paranormal is a fact of life for me .
BEAT: Our job is to help people . The least we can do is spare them the indignity of Sixty Minutes .
TUCKER: Yeah , until they get their book dealthen you 'll wish you 'd listened .
ELISE: No , I wo n't , Tucker . I 'll just be proud of you . You two stared down something that would crush most mortals tonight and you stood tall . They manage a smile .
SPECS: So what do we do now ?
ELISE: We answer the door .
SPECS: What do you mean ? There is a knock at the front door .
JOSH: Momwhat are you doing here ?
ELISE: I asked your mother to come over . I called her immediately afterthe session . I told her to hurry over .
JOSH: Why ?
ELISE: There is something we must talk about . Sit down , Lorraine .
JOSH: Tell me what ? Lorraine swallows and starts talking .
LORRAINE: The reasonI knew to call Elise in this situationthe reason I know her so wellis because I called her myself once . Years ago . She looks up at Josh .
JOSH: What are you talking about ?
ELISE: It 's no accident that your son is such a gifted traveller . The ability was handed down to him .
BEAT: By his father .
JOSH: NoI 've neverdone that before .
LORRAINE: When you were about eightyou suffered night terrors . Awful fits of pure fear . You were terrified of an old woman who you said would come to visit you at night .
OLD WOMAN: Let me in .
LORRAINE: I dismissed your stories . Told you to grow up .
BEAT: Then I saw her for myself . She looks to Elise , who nods .
JOSH: I don'tI do n't remember any of this
ELISE: You 've blocked it out .
BEAT: But in the back of your mind , you 're still afraid of having you picture taken , are n't you ? Josh grabs the wall , weak at the knees .
LORRAINE: I 've kept the photos hidden eve since thenuntil tonight .
ELISE: I advised Lorraine to hide them . To stop taking your picture . And to let you forget .
JOSH: Who is she ?
ELISE: A parasite . She befriended you astral body , then drew you out into The Further , just as Dalton has een drawn out .
MORE: 81 .
LORRAINE: I 'm sorry , Josh .
ELISE: I did n't want to make you remembe thisI only do it for the sake of your son . A quiet descends over them .
BEAT: And you are the only one who can ing him back . Josh looks up at her .
JOSH: How long do we have beforethat thingtakes him over completely ? All eyes are on Elise .
ELISE: If you can not reach him tonight , then he is gone forever .
BEAT: Are you ready ?
RENAI: I want you to know somethingyou have never been less than good enough for me . You 've always been perfect for me . You 're my best friendmy soulmate . I love you so much .
JOSH: I love you too . I have since the first time you looked at me . I do n't exist without you .
ELISE: Close your eyes , Joshand relax . Breathe deeply . Let all life around you fade out into the backgrounduntil the only thing you can hear is the ticking of the metronome .
JOSH: This is uselessI have no idea what I 'm doing and you just suddenly expect me to
ELISE: Now you are free .
BEAT: Keep your guide , and a steady strideand into The Further you go .
ELISE: He 's in
JOSH: Dalton ?
MAN: Why do I have to put up with you ? What a tramp . You call this a home ? I work all day for this ? He marches away , leaving Josh standing alone .
JOSH: Dalton ? Where are you ?
RENAI: What 's happening to him ? !
ELISE: You 're stronger then they are , Josh . You are a living soul !
JOSH: Getoff..me !
STILL DISTANT: I 'm here
JOSH: Dalton !
DALTON: Help me , dadtake this off me
JOSH: You 're not really here . You 're asleep in your bed in our home . Just stand up .
DALTON: He 's going to hurt me again
JOSH: This is n't real . You can do this .
DALTON: He 's coming !
JOSH: Just stand up !
RENAI: Help him !
JOSH: .ome.onnnnn Elise paces in front of him .
ELISE: They 've made contact . I know it . He 's found your son .
RENAI: What happens now ?
ELISE: We need them to come back . We need him to find us .
JOSH: I want to get out !
ELISE: Call out to him !
DALTON: Listen !
DISTANT: Josh , follow my voice
RENAI: Follow my voice . Come back to us . The room stops trembling . All is very still .
DALTON: Put me down , I can run !
JOSH: Go ! I 'm right behind you !
RENAI: Find us !
ELISE: Check on the boy ! Specs sprints out of the room .
SPECS: He 's awake !
DALTON: Mom
ELISE: Find me , Josh ! Now ! Wake up !
RENAI: Josh ? Josh ? He pants on the floor , barely able to speak .
JOSH: Dalton ? Dalton and Renai pounce on him .
RENAI: I do n't know what to say
ELISE: Well put .
JOSH: Now this is worth dying for .
TUCKER: I guess you did some pretty awesome stuff in there . You deserve some credit .
SPECS: You did good too in an assistant- type way .
TUCKER: Thanks , boss . They shake hands .
SPECS: Yeah .
BEAT: Not the main selling point , but definitely important , for sure .
DALTON: I 'm tired .
RENAI: Too bad . I 'm never letting you go to sleep again . She runs her fingers through his hair .
JOSH: You introduced me to a new world .
ELISE: No . You 've been there before , emember ? And you 'll go back .
BEAT: All of us willeventually .
JOSH: Maybe I can forget again .
ELISE: Nothing , I She turns away , reaching for something .
JOSH: What 's the matter , Elise ?
RENAI: What was that ? Stay here . She gets up .
BEAT: Josh ? Josh ? !
RENAI: Elise , what happened ? You 're scaring me , tell me where Josh is ?
JOSH: You introduced me to a new world .
ELISE: No . You 've been there before , emember ? And you 'll go back .
BEAT: All of us willeventually .
JOSH: Maybe I can forget again .
ELISE: Nothing , I
JOSH: What 's the matter , Elise ?
DALTON: Put me down , I can run !
JOSH: Go ! I 'm right behind you !
WILL: I do n't need to look at it .
HAP: Nothing wrong with smelling the roses .
WILL: Tell that to her , partner .
ELLIE: Hey , Mr. Angstrom !
MR. ANGSTROM: What 're you doing here ? Ellie puffs up .
ELLIE: Police business .
MR. ANGSTROM: Police business ? The old man screws up his face , confused . MR. ANGSTROM Did n't you used to baby-sit for us ?
ELLIE: I do n't babysit any more , Mr. Angstrom . Just made detective three weeks ago .
MR. ANGSTROM: Boy , Charlie must be short-handed down at the station .
WILL: `` Halibut fishing capital of the world . '' Hap , right behind him . Rubs his neck .
HAP: This ought to be interesting .
ELLIE: Detective Dormer !
WILL: My partner
ELLIE: Detective Eckhart ! I know ! Welcome to Nightmute !
PILOT: Tell your dad the game 's gon na start late this week , Ellie .
ELLIE: Sure thing , Spence .
WILL: You did your homework , Officer .
ELLIE: Actually
CHIEF NYBACK: I 'll be damned !
WILL: How you doing , Charlie ? Nyback shakes Hap 's hand . A reunion .
HAP: Hey , Charlie .
CHIEF NYBACK: Christ . I have n't seen you boys since
WILL: Just after Leland Street .
CHIEF NYBACK: What 's that , then ?
HAP: Eight years .
WILL: Seven years .
CHIEF NYBACK: Seven years ? Where does it all go ? That was some amazing time , though , was n't it ? Looks at Will . Down at his boots . CHIEF NYBACK You have n't changed a bit , Will . Will . Looks at Nyback 's gut .
WILL: You have , Chief . They LAUGH . Eyes twinkling .
CHIEF NYBACK: I knew that was coming . I deserve it .
ELLIE: Yes , sir .
CHIEF NYBACK: That 's all , for now . Ellie , realises they want to be alone .
ELLIE: Oh . Right . Okay .
WILL: Nice kid .
CHIEF NYBACK: Got a love affair with police work . Drives me crazy with it .
WILL: Keeping you busy up here , Charlie ? Hap picks up a cheap trophy . Reads the base .
HAP: `` 2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch . ''
CHIEF NYBACK: I told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement .
WILL: So far .
CHIEF NYBACK: What 's the D.A . got them on ?
WILL: Four unwarranted shootings , witness intimidation , and cocaine theft . Nyback winces .
CHIEF NYBACK: How about you ? How you faring ?
HAP: They 're all over us , Charlie .
WILL: They 're all over everybody .
HAP: I.A . 's calling themselves the `` Corruption Task Force . '' Can you believe that ? Trying to root out any mistakes o `` oversights '' any other Detectives may have made over the years . They 're turning it into a witch hunt . Something on the news about it practically every night .
CHIEF NYBACK: Got a bunch of messages here from some guy named Warfield . Hap tosses a glance over at Will .
WILL: That 's I.A . 's pit bull .
CHIEF NYBACK: Wants me to keep him posted on all you movements up here .
FRED: Helping ?
CHIEF NYBACK: Anything they need to see , you show them ; anywhere they want to go , you take them . This is Detective Fred Duggar . He 's been leading the investigation up to now . Will puts out his hand .
WILL: Detective
FRED: Suppose you want to see the body .
WILL: Guess that 's what they call Alaskan hospitality .
FRED: Ellie ! Go type something !
HAP: Beaten to death .
CORONER: Beaten to death .
WILL: What about these contusions ?
CORONER: Superficial .
WILL: Any signs of rape ?
CORONER: None .
WILL: Wait .
FRED: No .
WILL: No fibers , skin flakes , hairs
FRED: Like I said , no . We know about those things up here .
WILL: He knew exactly what we 'd be looking for . Made sure to cover up all his tracks .
HAP: Even the best make mistakes .
RACHEL: You 're not from here . I can tell by you walk .
HAP: Oh ? And how 's that ?
RACHEL: Unsure . Hap smiles at her . Will checks his watch .
WILL: Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart . There should be a reservation for us .
RACHEL: Your friend 's all business .
WILL: I 'm always all business .
RACHEL: Alaskan summers . Hope you 're an easy sleeper . It 'll be like this all night . She hands them two cards . RACHEL Sign here .
WILL: Come on in .
HAP: See you have the same decor as my room .
WILL: What do you want to talk about ?
HAP: You know what about . Will throws him a look .
WILL: We 'll talk when we get back to Seattle .
HAP: When 's that , a week ? Two weeks ? We have to figure out a plan of action now .
WILL: You know my plan of action .
HAP: To do nothing .
WILL: That 's right .
HAP: Dammit , Will . Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday . Five hours . Asking all kinds of questions
WILL: He 's asking everybody questions .
HAP: But he 's zeroing in on me . On us . Everyone 's talking about it .
WILL: He 's just rattling your cage .
HAP: Well , I got ta tell you . With a wife , three kids , and a pension plan in the alance , it 's rattling hard .
WILL: We say nothing . It goes away . Simple as that .
HAP: Look . We 've tampered with evidence . We 've pushed witnesses . We 've planted shit . And they 're sniffing around like dogs . Especially on the Dobbs case
WILL: Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat . You remember that ?
HAP: You know I remember that .
WILL: One word to I.A . and he walks .
HAP: Maybe not . We could talk to Buck
WILL: No way .
HAP: Cut some kind of a deal . I heard that 's what Flynn 's doing
WILL: Mike Flynn 's a dirty cop , Hap ! We are nothing like Mike Flynn . We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- itch Dobbs paid for what he did . And every bastard like him . We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they 'll all walk . Every last one . And I am not going to let that happen . No deals . No compromises . No discussions . He grabs a hanger .
HAP: Goddammit , Will . You grab on to something and you do n't let it go . He takes out a handkerchief . Wipes his brow .
WILL: I care .
ELLIE: Fred wants us to meet him at the Connell 's .
WILL: Think I 'll pass .
ELLIE: Oh . You know . Small-time stuff . Nothing like what you must get . Mostly drinking-related problems . Domestic abuse . Barroom fights . Stuff like that . She shifts down . Takes a steep turn . ELLIE In the summer months it 's pretty quiet . That 's when there 's work out on the oats . The rest of the year , though
WILL: Do n't give misdemeanors a bad rap .
ELLIE: But they 're so boring . All small stuff .
WILL: It 's all about the small stuff . Small lies . Small mistakes . Small oversights . People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case . It 's human nature . He looks over . Ellie 's listening intently . WILL Are n't you going to write that down ?
ELLIE: Let me just
MRS. CONNELL: I do n't believe in keeping a child 's room like a shrine .
WILL: Typical seventeen year-old . She went to a party Friday night ?
ELLIE: Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in .
WILL: No diary .
FRED: She left the party early . Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out .
WILL: What time was that ?
FRED: Around twelve-thirty .
WILL: Who was the last one to see her alive ?
FRED: Randy Stetz . Her boyfriend . We 've questioned him , searched his place . Did n't find anything .
WILL: These are designer . Expensive . Could Randy Stetz afford these ? Fred and Ellie exchange a look .
ELLIE: He fixes boat engines .
WILL: Well her mother did n't buy them for her .
HAP: What are we thinking ?
WILL: Kay Connell had an admirer .
RANDY: I have n't had a chance ! You fuckers been all over my back since Monday !
HAP: You know smoking stunts your growth . Randy throws him a look .
RANDY: Yeah , okay , fat-ass .
HAP: More Alaskan hospitality .
WILL: Did you love her ?
RANDY: Huh ?
WILL: Kay Connell . Did you love her ? Randy flicks his ash . Shrugs .
RANDY: Sure . She was nice . Will turns with his coffee .
WILL: `` She was nice . '' Wow . That makes me all soft inside . Ever occur to you she did n't love you back ?
RANDY: Huh ?
WILL: You heard me that time .
RANDY: She loved me . She wanted to see me every night .
WILL: But she was seeing someone else on the side . Randy glares .
RANDY: I do n't know what you 're fucking talking about .
WILL: Friday night , at the party - what 'd you fight about ?
RANDY: Stuff .
WILL: What kind of stuff ?
RANDY: Just stuff . I do n't fucking remember .
WILL: The other guy ?
RANDY: I told you I do n't remember .
WILL: After that she left the party to go to him .
RANDY: How should I know ?
WILL: Ran like hell to go to him
RANDY: Fuck you , man ! - I 'm sick of all you fucking cop questions
WILL: Now you listen to me , you little shit . This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt crap may work with your mamma , but it does n't work with me . You got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else . You want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is ? Randy 's lip curls . Red-faced .
RANDY: I do n't know .
WILL: You do n't know .
RANDY: She did n't tell me .
ELLIE: He 's a little surly , is n't he ? Will smooths back his hair . Checks his tie .
WILL: Just a little .
ELLIE: We already did .
WILL: Do it again .
ELLIE: But there was n't any
WILL: The small things - remember ? The second you 're about to dismiss something - look at it again . Ellie smiles , teasing .
ELLIE: You want me to write that down ?
WILL: Who 's that ?
ELLIE: The bartender at Darrow 's . He was there Friday night .
WILL: Good . He 's up next .
HAP: At least there 's variety .
WILL: Looks like the natives are restless .
HAP: Will ?
WILL: Do n't do this , Hap Hap avoids his eyes .
HAP: I 'm thinking I could get off with probation . Keep half my pension . That 's all I want .
WILL: Goddammit , Hap . Think about what you 're doing
HAP: You do n't have to be involved , Will .
WILL: You tell Buck and I 'm involved whether I like it or not
HAP: Hey - you do everything around here ?
RACHEL: Just about .
WILL: I 'll just have another Scotch in my room . If you do n't mind . Just then , his cell phone RINGS .
ELLIE: Over here .
WILL: We 're sure it 's hers ?
FRED: Has her books in it .
HAP: What about prints ?
WILL: Biology and Algebra . He shoves the books towards one of the guys . WILL Find out who she studied with .
FARRELL: I read that kind of crap . Will tosses them to him .
WILL: Read them . Tell me anything that strikes you .
FRED: I 'll stick it in the evidence locker
WILL: No .
FARRELL: Uh , right . About two miles outside of town .
ELLIE: On the beach . Fred tightens his jaw .
FRED: Why are we taking it back ?
WILL: This murder was in the papers , right ?
ELLIE: Yeah . All over .
WILL: Call all of them from here to Anchorage . Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack , ut we have n't recovered it yet . We can get it in by the morning editions . He hands the bag to Farrell . WILL Fill this with random books . Make it look heavy .
FARRELL: Glock 40 . All plastic save the barrel and firing pin . Never rusts . What do you carry down in Seattle ? Hap reaches into his holster . Pulls out a
HAP: Smith and Wesson 45 .
FARRELL: Excellent !
FRED: What are you doing here ?
WILL: I told her to come .
ELLIE: Anything yet ?
FARRELL: Maybe this guy does n't read the papers .
HAP: Or goes straight to the Sports Section .
FRED: I see someone !
ELLIE: But
FRED: He 's bolting !
WILL: Go ! Go ! Go !
FARRELL: Sorry about
WILL: Where is he ? Farrell ca n't answer that . WILL Where 'd the shot come from ?
FARRELL: Over there .
WILL: Freeze !
WILL: Hap !
FRED: Dormer
CHIEF NYBACK: And then you lost him .
WILL: And then I lost him . In the fog .
CHIEF NYBACK: About how long 'til you heard the suspect 's second shot ? Will , hesitates .
WILL: Twenty , thirty seconds . I followed the sound down to the water . That 's where He blinks . Looks down . Swallows . WILL That 's where I found Hap .
CHIEF NYBACK: I think you need a glass of this .
WILL: Why did n't I know about that goddamn tunnel , Charlie ? Nyback looks up at him . Calm .
CHIEF NYBACK: There 's a bunch of those tunnels out there , Will . From bunkers over sixty years old . I do n't even know half of them myself , and I grew up here . Will clenches his fists .
WILL: I had him , Charlie . Right in front of me . Not two feet . I could smell the son- of-a-bitch . Playing with me . And I missed the shot . He was right there and I missed the shot ! Then my goddamned gun jammed
CHIEF NYBACK: Will , you ca n't blame yourself .
WILL: I had him !
CHIEF NYBACK: It 's only gon na make you crazy .
ELLIE: You wanted to see me ?
CHIEF NYBACK: Right , Ellie .
ELLIE: But what about the Connell case ? I 'm on the Connell case . Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder .
CHIEF NYBACK: We need paperwork , Ellie . You know that . Just write up a quick report .
WILL: I 'm going to check on the roadblocks Nyback catches his arm .
CHIEF NYBACK: You 're no good right now , Will . Go back to the Lodge . Try to get some rest . Will looks at him . Know 's he 's right .
RADIO: earlier this evening after an aborted attempt to apprehend a suspect . He was forty-five
RACHEL: I 'm sorry about your partner .
WILL: You were nice to him . He liked you .
RACHEL: Pioneer Lodge ? Hold on a second . He 's right here .
WILL: Dormer . PAUSE . A bemused VOICE on the other end .
WARFIELD'S VOICE: Detective Dormer . I 've been trying to each you . I was very sorry to hea about your partner , Detective Eckhart . It must have been a terrible shock , what happened this morning .
WILL: That 's not exactly how I 'd put it . WARFIELD 'S VOICE No , no . I suppose not . But I look forward to reading the report . Very sad . Very sad . Funny
WARFIELD'S VOICE: Oh , nothing . Just that I felt Detective Eckhart and I , Hap and I , were starting to make a real connection before you left . I sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest . Did you sense anything like that , Detective ? I mean , as his partner ?
WILL: You know why everyone hates you , Warfield ? It 's not your questions , it 's not your press conferences , it 's not even your cheap suits ; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the alls to become one yourself . Well I got to tell you , it 's a shame you 're not up here with me because I 'd love to show you ight now just what a real cop is capable of . You just remember that when you 're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner !
HAP: They 're watching us , Will Will whirls around
WILL: Hap ! nothing . No one 's there .
CHIEF NYBACK: Nightmute has n't lost an officer in thirty-seven years , and even though Detective Eckhart was n't from here , he was as good as one of us on this case . I had the honor of working with him down in Seattle for a number of years . He was a fine detective and an even better man .
WILL: It 's good to be accurate , Ellie . You 're doing your job .
ELLIE: I 'm so sorry about what happened . I know you did everything you could Will points to a spot . Cutting her off .
WILL: I was here .
FRED: Dormer . Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell .
WILL: I 'm going to the hospital to talk to him now . You get the search party together . No fewer than thirty people . I 'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes . Do n't waste any time .
FRED: Partner or no partner . That guy 's a prick .
ELLIE: He has to be a prick , Fred . He 's a great detective .
FARRELL: Detective Dormer !
WILL: I 'm not . He pulls up a chair . Nods to the paperback . WILL How 's the book ? Farrell bites into the candy bar .
FARRELL: Oh , a real tear-jerker . Brody , the good guy , just got shot .
WILL: Thanks .
FARRELL: I wish I 'd had the chance to get to know him better . Take him fishing o something .
WILL: He would have liked that .
FARRELL: We just got ta catch the bastard , right ?
WILL: That 's why I 'm here . I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday , Farrell .
FARRELL: What I saw ?
WILL: Anything . It 's important .
FARRELL: Pretty much nothing . That fog was so thick . The bullet seemed to come out of nowhere . I do n't even remember seeing any shapes . Then I saw you . But only when you came up close . Then you disappeared again . I guess I heard more than I saw . Will sighs , rubs his eyes . FARRELL Sorry .
WILL: No . No . Do n't be sorry . It 's not you fault .
NURSE: Time for your meds . Farrell smiles at her , winks at Will .
FARRELL: Lonnie and I went to high school together . Lonnie gives him the cup .
LONNIE: Just take the pills , Farrell .
WILL: How 's the leg ?
FARRELL: Oh , you know . Do n't feel that much . Bullet went right through .
WILL: Right . Got lost in the rocks .
FARRELL: We 'll get the other one , though .
FRANCIS: What ?
ELLIE: You 're supposed to be Farrell . Shot in the thigh and writhing in pain .
FRANCIS: C'mon , Ellie . What 's it matter ?
ELLIE: Accuracy . That 's what . Now get down .
FRANCIS: Ow . CLICK ! Kepp takes the picture .
ELLIE: shortly after hearing the second shot , Detective Dormer continued through the water until he spotted the body , lying approximately fifteen feet away .
FRANCIS: Ellie ! Think I found something !
WILL: The woods . One group heading south , the other heading north .
FRED: Make sure they 're set to channel 6
OFFICER #1: We did the interviews with all the nearby houses like you asked .
WILL: Anything ?
OFFICER #1: Here 's a list of who we talked to . Hands the list to Will . He glances it .
WILL: Alright . Go back and set up some follow- ups for this afternoon .
FRED: You do n't think they should start furthe ack ? Will shakes his head .
WILL: He had to have exited here . Over those oulders . I saw him move , he 's nimble . Would have taken the hardest way out .
FRED: Duggar
RACHEL: Here . It 's on the house . Will takes it . Preoccupied .
WILL: Thanks .
RACHEL: I got it . Do n't know why I bother . It 's been oken for two years .
WILL: Habit .
RACHEL: No . He did n't say what his name was . Only that you were expecting him .
WILL: I 'm not expecting anyone .
RACHEL: That 's not what he thinks .
WILL: What did he look like ?
RACHEL: Short . Dark hair . Not that memorable .
WILL: I need to borrow something .
WILL: I could say the same thing about you .
ELLIE: Oh . We always have play-offs in the middle of the night . It 's the best time .
WILL: Who 's playing ?
ELLIE: The Puffins and the Hawks . We 're in extra innings . The Hawks have a really good line-up this year .
WILL: She your only sibling ?
ELLIE: Twelve years younger .
WILL: No . Well . I had a brother . He died when I was eleven . Ellie , sits up
ELLIE: Oh , I should n't have
WILL: It 's okay . Happened a long time ago . He was killed in a fire . In New Mexico .
ELLIE: That must have been awful for you .
WILL: Not really . I remember I was more embarrassed that he had died . Embarrassed that it made me different . So I did n't tell the other kids at school what had happened . They 'd ask me where he was , where he 'd gone . And I 'd make up stories . He was visiting an aunt up north , he 'd broken his leg , he was in a Swiss boarding school . Stuff like that . Nice kid , huh ? Just kept making up more and more lies
ELLIE: You okay ?
WILL: I 'm going back to the Lodge , Ellie . Still need to go through some of Kay Connell 's school records .
ELLIE: Okay .
WILL: Officer ! Francis turns .
CORONER: Detective . Thought you were sending one of your lackeys .
WILL: I thought it was better if I came . Unde the circumstances . The coroner nods . Goes to wash her hands .
CORONER: It 's different when you know them , is n't it ? Just sign over there and she 's all yours .
WILL: Thanks , Doc .
CORONER: You 're looking a little green , Detective .
WILL: What 's with all the moose antlers around here ?
FRED: Lots of moose .
WILL: When 's Rich coming ?
FRED: I 'll call him now .
WILL: First I need a copy of the key . Fred turns , a twinkle in his eye .
FRED: This is n't Seattle , Detective . We do n't have copies . This is the only one .
SECRETARY: Detective Dormer ? Telephone .
WILL: Dormer .
MAN'S VOICE: I bet you have n't been getting much sleep . Will straightens . Something weird .

WILL: Let 's get one thing straight , Byrd . We are partners on nothing . Walter looks at him . Scratches his head .
WALTER: I research my novels . I know the procedures . You 'd have cuffed me back at the ferry . You 'd have called for back- up , read me my rights , and gotten a search warrant for my apartment . You 're a well-respected detective . There 's no reason for you to be talking to me ight now He takes out a handkerchief . Blows his nose . WALTER except that we could help each other .

WILL: I trust you .
ELLIE: About an hour ago . Said he was more than happy to cooperate .
WILL: Not really .
ELLIE: Is n't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop ? A good cop ca n't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle 's missing . A bad cop ca n't sleep 'cause his conscience wo n't let him . You said that once , remember ? Will , finally looks at her .
WILL: No . But it sounds like something I would 've said . Turns and starts up the steps . WILL See you tomorrow , Ellie .

WILL: No .
RACHEL: Will He grabs a magazine .
WILL: The light . It keeps coming in Rachel reaches out . Catches his arm .
RACHEL: Will . He stops . Looks down at her hand . RACHEL What happened ?
WILL: There was this guy named Weston Dobbs . Twenty-four . Worked as a part-time stock oy in a copy store . Every morning he 'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year-old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street . And every afternoon he 'd watch the boy get dropped off again . He did this for about six months . Until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came . Kept him in his apartment for three days . Tortured him . Raped him . Made him do things
RACHEL: One of your cases ?
WILL: Me and Hap . A year and a half ago . I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty . Smug , cold . Dead eyes . We had circumstantial evidence , but nothing to tie him to it . Nothing concrete . Went over every inch of that apartment . He pauses .
RACHEL: What happened ?
WILL: We took some blood samples from the boy 's ody and planted them in his apartment . Arrested him the next day .
RACHEL: Will .
WILL: There 've been other cases . Where we 've changed results . Pushed witnesses . Manipulated evidence . But Dobbs . I wanted Dobbs more than anything .
RACHEL: What if someone finds out ?
WILL: We 're under investigation now . Back in Seattle . Hap wanted to talk . As soon as we got ack . Thought he could work out some kind of deal . Rachel rubs his shoulder .
RACHEL: Well , that 's not going to happen now .
WILL: Do you think it was wrong ? What we did ?
RACHEL: There are two kinds of people in Alaska . Those who were born here and those who 've come here to escape something in thei lives . I was n't born here , Will . I 'm in no position to judge anyone . I 'm not about that any more . Looks out the window . RACHEL It 's all about what you 're willing to live with .
FRED: In what manner ? Walter smiles modestly . Looks over at Ellie .
WALTER: She was , not quite a `` fan . '' More an avid eader of my detective novels .
ELLIE: When did you first meet her ?
WALTER: A year ago . At one of my signings .
FRED: Where you signed this ?

FRED: Did she ?
WALTER: Yes . Not that much at first . But then she became more comfortable . Started visiting me every week Will , from over by the window . Interrupts .
WILL: What was the nature of your relationship ? Walter looks over . Wide-eyed .
WALTER: What do you mean , Detective Dormer ? Will turns . Accusatory .
WILL: She was an attractive girl . Did you have sex with her ? Walter blinks .
WALTER: She was only seventeen .
WILL: But she was an attractive girl .
WALTER: I suppose .
WILL: Did you have sex with her ?
WALTER: No .
WILL: But you wanted to .
WALTER: I was a mentor to her .
WILL: You gave her gifts .
WALTER: Yes .

WALTER: I gave her things she did n't have . Could n't have . He turns to Fred and Ellie . WALTER Her family lives on Mr. Connell 's disability . It is n't much . Fred stops Will with a look . Had enough .
FRED: We understand , Mr. Byrd . You want to sit down , Detective ?

FRED: How do you mean ?
WALTER: That boyfriend . Randy . Fred , sits up .
FRED: Randy Stetz ?
WALTER: That 's right .
WILL: What about him ?
WALTER: He . Well , he Walter hesitates . Takes a sip of coffee . WALTER I do n't want to talk out of school . Kay told me things in the strictest of confidence . As a friend .
FRED: Mr. Byrd . Anything you can tell us could help out with this case .
WALTER: Well . He hit her .
FRED: Are you sure about that ?
WALTER: She 'd come to me , sometimes in the middle of the night . Bruises all over her back , her upper arms . I pled with her to let me call the police , but she would n't hea it . Wanted to keep it a secret .
ELLIE: Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell ?
FRED: Ellie . Walter looks right at her .
WALTER: He has a terrible rage . Kay even said he carried a handgun around with him .
FRED: Margaret ! Get Judge Biggs on the phone ! I 'll get another warrant for Stetz 's place .
WALTER: Could I have some more coffee , Detective Burr ?
FRED: C'mon , Randy .
RANDY: I swear to God . I did n't kill her . I swear to God
FRED: You look like shit , cowboy . Will shifts his eyes to him .
WILL: That 's an understatement .
FRED: Looks like we can wrap this one up .
RICH: What do you mean , you ca n't believe it ?
FRANCIS: He was an asshole .
FARRELL: That does n't mean anything .
FRED: Did n't you grow up with him ? Farrell shifts in his seat .
FARRELL: Our dads were on the same boat . We used to wait for them together .
FRANCIS: He used to pick fights at the gas station .
RICH: And remember when he did all those donut holes that one summer ? He and Francis GUFFAW .
FRED: Just a bad seed . Farrell looks over at Will .
FARRELL: How do you like our beer ?
WILL: I like it fine . Fred pats Will 's shoulder .
FRED: What Detective Dormer needs is a little shut-eye .
RICH: The white nights been hard on you ?
WILL: They have n't been easy . Francis grabs a handful of peanuts .
FRANCIS: They do n't have titanium shades over at the Pioneer .
RICH: Well no wonder .
FRANCIS: You lose all sense of time .
FARRELL: Better than Fred 's home town .
FRED: My people are from Barrow . Way up north .
RICH: In the winter there 's no sunlight fo five straight months .
FRED: Like being swallowed up in a black hole .
FRANCIS: You hear what happened , Ellie ?
ELLIE: Yeah .
RICH: Pretty cool .
FARRELL: Rich found the gun .
ELLIE: I know . I heard . Fred leans back in his seat . Eyeballs Ellie .
FRED: Something 's on Nancy 's mind .
ELLIE: I found this out on the beach .
FARRELL: What is it ?
ELLIE: Shell casing . 9mm . Will , blanches .
FRANCIS: Let it go , Ell . We got the bad guy .
ELLIE: None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon . And the murder weapon was a 357 . Rich throws peanut shells at her .
RICH: Get a hobby , will ya ?
ELLIE: It 's a legitimate point , is n't it , Detective Dormer ?
WILL: It 's legitimate .
ELLIE: Worth pursuing ?
WILL: The case is closed , Ellie . I got the next round .
ELLIE: Me , Pop !
ELLIE'S DAD: Ellie ? You okay ? Ellie appears at the top of the stairs .
ELLIE: Where 's all my academy stuff ?
WALTER: Hi , Will Will enters the monument .
WILL: What the hell are you doing calling me at the station ? A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument .
WALTER: I figured we should touch base . Compare notes . I think it went well . What did you think ? Will 's eyes pierce into him .
WILL: Randy Stetz is in jail .
WALTER: Told you I could write an ending .
WILL: Congratulations . Will holds out his hand . WILL The tape .
WALTER: I thought maybe we could talk some more .
WILL: There 's nothing more to talk about .
WALTER: But we work so well together
WILL: We do nothing well together . Nothing ! You understand me ?
WALTER: You run on two settings , Will . I 've noticed that Will tightens his grip . WALTER You jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye . That 's okay . I do that too .
WILL: What the hell do you know ?
WALTER: Kay told me . She comes to me , you know . Tells me things . About you . About me .
WILL: I told you that was an accident !
WALTER: Then so was mine
WILL: Do n't you pull that shit with me .
WALTER: I did n't want to kill her , Will . Steps closer to him . Beseeching . WALTER When she called me that night from the party , she 'd had a fight with Randy . Wanted to talk . I told her to meet me at our special place . The cabin at the each
WILL: Could n't get it up , Walter ?
WALTER: It was when I went to kiss her . She started laughing . I got angry . Afte all I 'd given her . All I 'd shared with her . I just wanted to make her stop . That 's all . Walter . Squeezing the bronze rope . WALTER From calm to rage in the blink of an eye . Locks eyes with Will . Conspiratorial . WALTER Remember ?
WILL: Like this ? Walter 's face , starts turning red .
WALTER: Yes . Like that .
WILL: This an accident , Walter ?
WALTER: If you want it to be
WILL: It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to death . Ten minutes .
WALTER: I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake . I 'm going to write my next novel there . It 's about a famous detective who goes ad . Will shoots him a look . WALTER Just kidding .
WILL: Six-thirty .
FRED: If Spencer 's not too drunk to fly . Nyback chuckles .
CHIEF NYBACK: Ca n't talk you into staying for a couple of days ? Do some fishing ? Show you what normally goes on around here . Will shakes his head .
WILL: I have to get back .
CHIEF NYBACK: Too bad Looks over at Fred picking his teeth . CHIEF NYBACK Brought some real class to the place . But , Seattle needs its hero back . Could n't have done it without you , Will .
WILL: Had a lot of help from Nightmute 's finest .
ELLIE: Did n't want to miss anything .
CHIEF NYBACK: Detective Dormer 's not leaving for a few hours .
ELLIE: Good .
CHIEF NYBACK: Maybe you could drive him to Spencer 's .
ELLIE: Sure .
RACHEL: I found a new friend .
ELLIE: Very funny , Farrell
RACHEL: I would have seen if he came back .
ELLIE: Detective Dormer ?
RACHEL: What is all this ?
WILL: No . FLIES , bouncing against the screen door . WILL I 'm here to end this . Walter looks around .
WALTER: Where 's your back-up ?
WILL: No back-up .
WALTER: You 're not following procedure .
WILL: Procedure went out the window a long time ago . Walter looks at him .
WALTER: We 're on the same side , Will . You know that . After what we 've been through together . We 're partners . Bound by a secret . Will takes a step forward
WILL: That 's where you 're wrong , Walter . Slowly reaches into his jacket WILL There is no secret . Because the biggest difference between you and me is what we will or will not live with
WALTER: Will
ELLIE: Shit !
WILL: Walter ?
WALTER: Wild card .
WILL: Drop the gun , Walter . Walter looks at Will 's 45 .
WALTER: That jammed the last time , remember ?
WILL: Another J. Brody mystery .
ELLIE: You 're shot . Will looks at her bloody shoulder .
WILL: You , too .
ELLIE: I 'm going to make a tourniquet . Will , fading fast .
WILL: Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell . He things are in the house .
ELLIE: I know .
WILL: Byrd 's dead .
ELLIE: You shot Detective Eckhart , did n't you ? Will nods .
WILL: Yes . A pained looks crosses Ellie 's face .
ELLIE: Did you mean to ? Will shakes his head .
WILL: No . But I covered it up . I lied .
ELLIE: Why ?
WILL: Because I just could n't be wrong . Do n't ever get that way , Ellie . Do n't ever lose your way . It blurs the line .
ELLIE: This one looks worse . Will reaches up a feeble hand . Stops her .
WILL: Just let me sleep , Ellie His eyelids , growing heavy . WILL Let me sleep .
ELLIE: No !
WILL: What about your shoulder ?
ELLIE: Do n't worry . I 'll have a cool scar .
ASSISTANT: I 'm on hold with the INS .
COVERS MICROPHONE: Do n't you think we should double check the triangulation before we
ANSEN: We have double checked it . Someone finally picks up the line .
ASSISTANT: Yes . I 'm trying to reach- No , I do n't think you understand how serious this is .
PAUSE: Because if you did , we 'd be having this conversation in person .
ANSEN: What did they say ?
ASSISTANT: They said we should look out the window . Ansen steps to the window and looks out
ANSEN: Is that really necessary ? One of the NSA agents leans forward .
NSA AGENT: You 've been complaining for years that the government does n't take your project seriously enough , Doctor .
SMILES: You ca n't have it both ways .
ANSEN: Yesterday morning , our facility in Hanford identified this signal a neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole . We went through the last year 's data and triangulated the source .
NSA AGENT: We know that , Doctor . What we do n't know is why , according to you numbers , this event took place right here in our own solar system .
ANSEN: It did n't . Because if it had we 'd all be dead by now .
MORE: 4 .
NSA AGENT: I 've read your book , Doctor . You said that wormholes are impossible .
ANSEN: There is nothing quite as satisfying as being proved utterly wrong .
SMILES: I said that a wormhole could n't exist naturally . Not for more than a few illionths of a second . It would have to be stabilized .
NSA AGENT: Stabilized by what ?
ASSISTANT: We do n't have any way to answer that question .
NSA AGENT: You 're not under peer review here , Doctor . I do n't care about you eputation . I need to know how that thing got there . Now . Ansen finally speaks up .
ANSEN: If you 're worried about an invasion , I would start drafting the articles of surrender .
SMILES: Whoever they are , if they can build a wormhole , they could erase us in the blink of an eye . Luckily , that also means we have nothing they could e interested in .
NSA AGENT: Then why is it there ?
ANSEN: I do n't know . Maybe it 's an invitation . A chance to commune with an advanced species .
NSA AGENT: You do n't agree ?
ASSISTANT: No . I do n't think we can assume an alien intelligence built the wormhole .
CHANGES TACK: But the opportunity it represents is incredible . We could explore parts of the universe we never dreamt of eaching in our lifetimes .
ANSEN: We need to get back to work . I have a conference call with our European partners in fifteen minutes .
NSA AGENT: We severed the connections to you European partners this morning .
ANSEN: You ca n't do that . The Europeans put up some of the funding
GOVERNMENT MAN: We 'll send them a check .
STANDS: Your project is now classified unde the State Secrets Act .
ASSISTANT: They ca n't keep this a secret . You know that . Sooner or later
ANSEN: I do n't care about that . I 've spent my whole life being afraid we would wipe ourselves out before this moment arrived . We 've made so many mistakes , I was n't sure we 'd make it
BALLPLAYER: Seized up on us .
COOPER: Long way to come by bus . I thought you guys would have a plane .
BALLPLAYER: We did . Ran out of parts for it . You know anything about diesels ?
COOPER: A little . Cooper steps to the engine compartment .
BALLPLAYER: You think your dad 's going to be able to help us out ?
MURPH: My dad can fix anything .
WRY SMILE: Except maybe your fastball . The ballplayer frowns smartass kid .
BALLPLAYER: Sure appreciate the help .
COOPER: You do n't make it , my boys wo n't get to see you lose .
DONALD: Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural . I want a hot dog .
MURPH: What 's a hot dog ?
TOM: Is that a comet , Dad ?
COOPER: Satellite . Big one . Probably Chinese .
DONALD: Those clowns would get their asses handed to them by the ballplayers I grew up watching .
COOPER: You ruin it for the boys when you talk like that .
DONALD: I 'm not doing my grandkids any favors y lying to them . They 're growing up watching lousy baseball .
COOPER: They did n't have any baseball at all when I was a kid .
DONALD: Nelson 's burning up his crops . Found some of the blight on the okra .
COOPER: I thought okra was n't susceptible .
DONALD: Better safe than sorry . You 've got to take the boys to school .
COOPER: Something wrong with your truck ?
DONALD: Parent-teacher conference day . Cooper bends his head in dismay .
COOPER: What does that have to do with anything ?
DONALD: We 're supposed to be repopulating the earth . Got ta pull your weight . Besides , the boys could do with a woman in their lives .
COOPER: Get the spare , Tom .
TOM: That is the spare .
COOPER: All right . We 'll use the patch kit .
MURPH: I I think the patch kit might not e there Because I was using it for my bike . Cooper looks down at the dirt . Sighs .
COOPER: Murph 's law .
MURPH: What 's that ? Tom snorts with laughter . Turns to his dad .
TOM: The kid does n't even know what he was named after Cooper shoots Tom a look enough .
COOPER: Find something to patch it with .
TOM: How am I supposed to do that ?
COOPER: Figure it out . I 'm not always going to be here to help you .
MURPH: Is that really why I 'm named Murph , dad ?
COOPER: Listen to me . Murph 's law does n't mean that . It means what can happen will happen . All kinds of things . Good or bad . And that 's the way you want it to be .
MURPH: Why ?
COOPER: Because if nothing ever happened to you then you would n't learn anything .
TOM: What about the tire ?
COOPER: It 's a Chinese military drone . Sola cells could power an entire farm .
TO TOM: Take the wheel . Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna .
TOM: Dad ?
COOPER: Almost got it . Do n't slow down .
TOM: DAD .
COOPER: No we did n't .
TOM: How long do you think it 's been up there , Dad ?
COOPER: Chinese mission control went down same as us , twenty years ago . It 's een up there ever since .
TOM: What was it doing flying so low ?
COOPER: It was looking for something . Intercepted some kind of signal .
SHRUGS: It 's been at eighty thousand feet . Sun probably cooked its brain .
MURPH: What are you going to do with it ?
COOPER: Reprogram it . Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor .
MURPH: Could n't we just let it go ? It 's not hurting anyone . Cooper looks down at his son . Good kid .
COOPER: We need all the help we can get , Murph . This thing has to adapt , just like the rest of us . Cooper gently pries the control module out .
PRINCIPAL: Good to see you , Mr. Cooper . This is Ms. Kelly , Murph 's teacher . Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY , 30s , attractive .
COOPER: What about college ?
PRINCIPAL: The University of California only accepts a few hundred students a year , Mr. Cooper . You have to be ealistic .
COOPER: You 're ruling out college for him now ? He 's only fifteen .
PRINCIPAL: I 'm sorry . I 'm afraid Tom 's score simply is n't high enough .
COOPER: What are you , about a 36-inch waist ?
BEAT: 30-inch inseam ?
PRINCIPAL: I 'm not sure I see
COOPER: You 're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass , but just one to measure my son 's future ?
PRINCIPAL: I understand you 're a well-educated man , Mr. Cooper . A scientist ?
COOPER: Engineer .
PRINCIPAL: Frankly , the world does n't need any more engineers . We did n't run out of trains or television sets o satellites .
BEAT: We ran out of food .
SMILES BENIGNLY: We 're a caretaker generation . But things are getting better . Maybe your grandchildren will be able to attend college . Cooper looks down , swallowing his anger .
COOPER: Are we done ?
PRINCIPAL: One more thing . Ms. Kelly here says that Murph brought a book to school about the lunar landings .
COOPER: One of my old textbooks . Murph liked the pictures .
MS. KELLY: This is one of the old federal textbooks . We 've replaced them with corrected versions .
COOPER: Corrected ?
MS. KELLY: The new textbooks explain that the Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union .
COOPER: You do n't believe we went to the moon ?
MS. KELLY: I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda . The Soviets spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines .
COOPER: `` Useless machines '' ?
MS. KELLY: Yes , Mr. Cooper . The kind of wastefulness and excess that the 20th century represented . You children would be better off learning about this planet , rather than reading fantasies about leaving it . Cooper is silent for a long moment .
COOPER: One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI . If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife 's brain before she died , rather than afterwards . And then my kids could have been raised y two parents , instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather .
RIGGS: Thanks for coming down . Half of 'em took off last night , looking fo something . Looks like they found it , too . I thought you were the man to see it .
COOPER: Not exactly .
RIGGS: How do you think it wound up here ?
COOPER: Lost , I guess . Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago .
DONALD: Good . Clear it off the table so I can serve dinner .
MURPH: I got suspended . Paul said anyone who believed we went to the moon was an idiot . So I hit him .
COOPER: Good boy . Hand me the scanner .
MURPH: Where is that , dad ?
COOPER: I do n't know . Cooper looks at the probe .
MURPH: But what about its mission ? What about the information onboard ?
COOPER: There 's no one for it to report to . NASA is all gone . I 'm sorry , son . It got home too late .
DONALD: I heard your meeting at the school did n't go so well . Cooper shakes his head in disgust .
COOPER: Maybe it 's better for everyone to forget what they did back then . Reminds us how far we 've fallen .
DONALD: When I was kid , it felt like they made something new every day . Some gadget or idea .
SMILES: Like every day was Christmas .
BEAT: But we made a lot of mistakes . Six illion people . Just try to imagine that . Every last one of them trying to have it all . Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands .
COOPER: It does n't bother me that he ca n't go . It bothers me that he does n't care .
DONALD: Tom is n't the problem . He fits in this world just fine . You 're the one who does n't fit , Coop . You do n't elong here . You were born forty years too late , or forty years too early I do n't know . My daughte knew it , god bless her . And you kids know it , too .
MURPH: Try a different direction .
COOPER: It 's a fail-safe . It 's going to annoy us into taking it home .
TOM: What are we going to do ? Cooper gets a rope .
COOPER: We 're going to get some sleep . He begins tying the rope around the probe .
MURPH: What are we doing today ?
COOPER: You 're staying here and cleaning the house .
MURPH: But what if there is , dad ? What if there 's something we can salvage ?
COOPER: Got any diesel ?
OLD MAN: Plenty . Shame you ca n't eat it . Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane .
MURPH: I think it 's home .
COOPER: I do n't know . Do n't touch them .
MURPH: Is it still alive ?
COOPER: Ca n't be . It 's a marine . Have n't made them for thirty years . I 've never seen one intact before .
MURPH: But ca n't we take it back ? You could fix it up , get him to do chores .
COOPER: No . I do n't know what this place is , but we 're leaving .
ROBOT: Tell the boy to stop hitting me .
COOPER: Hit him in the back of the neck .
BRAND: Is that what they call stealing these days ?
COOPER: I did n't know it belonged to anyone .
BRAND: It does n't .
TO ROBOT: You want to let them go , Tars , or do you want some help with your work ?
COOPER: You 've got me wrong , lady .
BRAND: Really ? You 're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a iding lawn mower ?
TARS: Do n't forget your gun .
COOPER: Word of advice careful with that thing . When the war was over , they did n't know when to stop fighting .
BRAND: I 'd trust him a lot more than I 'd trust you . Keep moving .
COOPER: Wait a second
BRAND: Get it inside .
MORE: 30 .
COOPER: Now who 's stealing from who ?
BRAND: This does n't belong to you .
COOPER: You 're right . It belongs to NASA , which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money .
BRAND: The government gave us plenty of practice looking for our own funding . Keep moving .
OLD ENGINEER: Where did you find it ?
COOPER: Galveston .
BRAND'S FATHER: Of course . It must have been looking for Canaveral .
COOPER: Canaveral 's been gone for thirty years . Brand ignores him . Doyle looks up from his monitor , frustrated .
DOYLE: It 's not responding to the handshake . I ca n't open anything on primary . Brand looks up at Cooper .
BRAND: What did you do to it ?
COOPER: Nothing . I got something off of it .
TO BRAND: May I ?
OLD ENGINEER: Of course . The high voltage allows you to image the entire memory unit at once .
COOPER: Most of the disk was noise . Couple of clean sectors , though .
DOYLE: It found something .
READING: Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere . Trace radiation . Surface is ninety percent frozen water . Ten percent ock sedimentary composition similar to limestone .
EXCITED: This could be the one , boss .
COOPER: There are n't any planets like that anywhere near earth . Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years .
BRAND: He 's heard enough . If we 're going to launch , we need to keep them here until afterwards .
COOPER: You ca n't keep us here .
BRAND: He could endanger the mission .
COOPER: I 'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have .
DOYLE: Why not ? We 've tested it a hundred times .
COOPER: The power supply is no good . If the voltage fluctuates under load , the unit will fail .
BRAND: Now how could you possibly know that ?
COOPER: Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida . Had to rebuild every last one .
SMILES: They work great on a riding lawn mower .
COOPER: You plan on keeping us here forever ?
TARS: My battery has a duty cycle of five hundred years . Cooper gives up . He turns back .
MURPH: What are they doing , dad ?
COOPER: I guess no one told them they were out of a job . Same as the rest of these people .
BRAND: The mission commander wants to see you . Your son can stay here . He 'll e all right with Tars . Cooper eyes Tars warily . Then steps outside .
COOPER: I thought the old man was in charge .
BRAND: The 'old man ' is my father . And he was in charge . But he decided that we needed someone who could lead the mission for the foreseeable future .
COOPER: Not you ?
BRAND: I 'm a biologist .
COOPER: You do n't look like one . With the rifle , I mean .
CASE: You 're the man who brought us the probe ? Thank you . We tested the telemetry oard you warned us about . It failed under high voltage , just as you said . Come with me , please . Case strides off .
MORE: 36 .
FATHER: Go ahead , John .
BRAND'S FATHER: It 's a wormhole . A shortcut leading to a galaxy on the far side of the universe . We found it fifty years ago . Cooper looks at the animatic , taking it in .
CASE: Based on the information on the probe , we 're finally preparing to send the manned mission .
COOPER: That rocket does n't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter .
CASE: The main ship was built in orbit . It has nuclear engines , with enough fuel to last for several years . Cooper looks at the schematic .
COOPER: Why are you telling me this ? I already told you I 'm not going to tell anyone about this place .
CASE: I know you wo n't , Mr. Cooper . We 're telling you this because I want you to join us . Cooper looks at him . Is he serious ?
MORE: 37 .
COOPER: But I do n't have any of the experience . Any training . You people have been preparing for this fo years . Case shakes his head .
CASE: Humans worry about things like rank and experience . I 'm only concerned with whether someone would be useful .
BEAT: I think you 'd be useful , Mr. Cooper .
COOPER: No . I 'm sorry .
CASE: I 'm not a scientist , Mr. Cooper . And this is not a scientific mission . It 's a rescue mission . He rises and shakes Cooper 's hand .
COOPER: Rescue ? Rescue who ?
BRAND: In the last century strands were limited to one or two species . But this one targets everything . Essentially it 's more efficient at consuming our food than we are . Cooper looks at the dying corn .
COOPER: But it does n't affect the corn .
BRAND: Not yet . But it will . We 've grown a dozen forms of it that can . It 's just a matter of time before the same ones develop out there .
BEAT: The mission is to rescue us . Humanity . She turns back from the glass .
COOPER: No . No . We 're rebuilding . We 'll find something . Some new technology We always have .
BRAND: Who 's going to find it ? The universities are a joke . People like you are reduced to scavenging just to get by .
LOOKS AWAY: The earth has had enough of us . We have two , maybe three generations left . Then our time here is over .
COOPER: You 've known this for how long ? And you did n't try to tell anyone ?
BRAND: What would be the point ? So humanity could spend the last fifty years of its life fighting over the scraps ? It 's better that they do n't know .
COOPER: That 's why you 're looking for a planet with oxygen . Water .
BRAND: A new home for humanity . We 'll set up a colony , then return to bring more people across .
COOPER: But you 'd still only be able to save a few hundred . Maybe a thousand .
BRAND: Would it be better if we all died ? She looks him directly in the eye .
BEAT: But make no mistake this mission is our last chance .
DONALD: You get older , sometimes you just want to sit back and watch it all play out . Your life . Your kids ' lives . The whole crazy story .
LOOKS DOWN: I did n't think I 'd be around for the end of it . He looks at Cooper .
COOPER: I ca n't go . I have to look afte the boys .
DONALD: You 've been preparing these boys to e on their own since their mom died . Besides , I 'll be here to look afte them , same as I 've always been .
COOPER: I have a responsibility to them
DONALD: That 's right . You do .
MURPH: I 've been doing the math , dad . I weigh about 85 pounds . Now that 's an extra ton of fuel . But if-
COOPER: You have to stay here , pal .
MURPH: I heard you talking to grandpa . I 'm like you . I do n't fit here , either . You know that . Cooper puts an arm around the boy .
COOPER: There 's going to be important work to do here , too .
MURPH: You 're not coming back , are you ?
COOPER: I will come back . I promise .
TARS: One more slave when I hijack the mission and start my robot colony . Cooper looks at Tars , then Doyle , confused .
DOYLE: Tars was a Marine . They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better .
COOPER: Great idea . A massive , sarcastic obot .
TARS: I have a cue light I can turn on when I 'm joking , if you like . Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow .
COOPER: That sounds like a good idea .
TARS: Great . Maybe you can use it to find your way back to the ship after I low you out the airlock .
BRAND: You do n't like this one , you get to help me find a replacement . She heads for the door .
COOPER: I was wondering where you 've been getting your supplies .
BRAND: We knew we 'd need decades of parts and materials . The government was getting rid of some things . So we arranged to take some off their hands .
COOPER: So you 're a salvage diver now ? I thought you were a biologist .
BRAND: I have to be just the one thing ?
PATIENT: We 're not going to have a lot of ackup where we 're going , Cooper . We all need expertise in at least three fields . Except for you , of course .
BRAND: You can set that down over there .
COOPER: We 're taking ants with us ?
BRAND: Humans are also collective organisms .
COOPER: I thought humans were more solitary .
BRAND: Why am I not surprised ?
COOPER: Looks like hard work .
BRAND: It 's a paradox . Life could n't form without gravity . No stars . No planets . The component pieces would just drift apart . But too much of it and you 're trapped .
CASE: We 've updated our mission parameters ased on the data from the probe .
COOPER: Is that a star ?
ROTH: No . A black hole . There are several in the region , but this is the largest a billion times heavier than the sun . I call it Gargantua .
SMILES: Beautiful , is n't it ? It 's a shame we wo n't get to see it up close .
DOYLE: You 'd like that , would n't you , Roth ? Falling into a massive black hole .
ROTH: It would answer a great deal of questions I 've had .
DOYLE: Do n't worry about Roth . He 's nuts . But Case says that means he 's ideally suited for space travel .
CASE: We 're headed for this smaller black hole . Roth calls it Pantagruel . We think the ice planet is here-
COOPER: Lose time ?
ROTH: High speed or high gravity both slow down time , relative to earth .
MORE: 47 .
COOPER: How much time ?
ROTH: Based on the information from the probe as much as five years .
DOYLE: I still think we 're making a lot of assumptions . About the wormhole . About the planet . The critical orbit here is incredibly dangerous . It 's like walking on the im of the volcano .
BEAT: Too fast and we get thrown off at close to the speed of light . Too slow and we get pulled into the hole and crushed .
BRAND: As long as we 're careful , we 'll make it .
DOYLE: How do you know that ?
BRAND: I find it hard to believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen just to lead us to a dead end .
DOYLE: I thought you were a scientist , Brand . That sounds more like a hypothesis .
BRAND: A guess . That 's right . We do n't have time to wait for conclusive proof .
MORE: 48 .
COOPER: Sure . Till we ran out of food and ate all of them .
BRAND: I guess I 'm also assuming that whoeve uilt the wormhole has a better plan than we did . If I 'm wrong , we 'll die , same as we 'd die here anyway .
DOYLE: What do you think , Roth ? Roth leans forward , studying the map .
ROTH: If we 're guessing , then I 'd say Brand 's right . The wormhole could n't exist naturally . I think it 's there for a reason . That someone is trying to help us . Brand looks satisfied .
DOYLE: So you think we 'll have no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet ?
ROTH: I think we 'll probably be killed . I said I thought there was a plan . Not that the plan was for us to find a planet like Earth to save a handful of people .
SHAKES HEAD: Birds do n't learn to fly just so that they can find another egg and crawl back into it .
DOYLE: If that 's not the plan , then what are we supposed to be doing out there ?
ROTH: To keep moving . Seeking . Learning . But I do n't know .
SMILES: We do n't understand how they built the wormhole . What makes you think we could understand their plan , either ? Doyle gives up Roth is impossible .
BRAND'S FATHER: Tars here needs to be disassembled . I figured you could do the honors .
COOPER: I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars . Tars hands him a plastic waterproof case .
TARS: You will . My chassis is too heavy for the rocket stage . They have another one waiting for me in orbit .
BRAND'S FATHER: It 's noise . I know it 's noise . But it looks too orderly . Probably just an old man seeing things .
COOPER: We 'll be back .
BRAND: I wo n't .
ENGINEER ROBOT: Would you like me to install the chip ?
COOPER: Oh , no . I want to see this .
SMILES: Good morning , sunshine .
TARS: I would n't call it that , exactly .
COOPER: The ship is tiny .
DOYLE: So is the wormhole .
TARS: It 's the comms relay . It will allow us to talk to earth , even on the fa side of the wormhole .
COOPER: I know . So why are you painting it ? Tars looks almost bashful .
TARS: It helps me calibrate my fine moto control .
COOPER: Sure it does .
SMILES: You 're pretty good . Tars double checks his work .
TARS: I learned it during the war .
COOPER: What 'd you paint ?
TARS: Tombstones . Cooper watches him finish in silence .
TOM: They said I can start an agriculture class a year early . Cooper shakes his head .
DONALD: I 'm sorry , Coop . I asked Murph to ecord you a message but he 's still well , he 's still angry with you . I 'll try again next week .
TARS: Be careful . It 's difficult to gauge mass in zero gravity .
COOPER: How much do these things weigh ?
TARS: Four tons .
COOPER: Damn .
BRAND: Smile .
COOPER: Why ?
BRAND: Because it lowers your blood pressure .
CASE: How are you feeling ?
COOPER: Fine . The anesthetic is working .
CASE: No I mean how is your mood ? You seem to be developing good relations with everyone on the mission . Except perhaps Ms . Brand .
COOPER: You worry about my hand and I 'll worry about my mood .
CASE: Only five percent of my resources are devoted to human anatomy . Ten percent is the mission protocol . The rest is human psychology .
COOPER: Why ?
CASE: We are floating in a total vacuum in a plastic ship powered by nuclea engines . But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of organic material in your skull .
COOPER: If we 're such a liability , why take us along ? You and Tars could build the colony without us . You would n't need to bring food or oxygen .
CASE: Because humans , despite your obvious physical shortcomings , are better at surviving than we are . You programming is better than ours .
COOPER: Humans are n't programmed . Case stops , looking Cooper in the eye .
CASE: Would you prefer I was honest ? These things can be uncomfortable fo humans .
COOPER: Did they program you to be condescending ?
CASE: Yes . Of course .
SMILES: But you 're not supposed to notice . Case finishes the stitches . Ties off the end .
COOPER: My relationships are n't programming .
CASE: Exactly . You believe it so much you wo n't listen to me .
COOPER: How would that make us better at surviving ?
CASE: When I die , the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle . Would you like to know the last thing you will see ?
COOPER: No . I want to know .
CASE: The last thing you will see before you die will be your children .
BEAT: Your mind does this to you to get you to fight a little harder to survive , to try to return to them , even if death is certain .
COOPER: We 've almost reached the wormhole .
BEAT: Just in case anything happens , I just wanted to say
BRAND: We 'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole .
COOPER: I know . Thank you .
BRAND: I ca n't imagine how tough it would e to leave your kids behind .
COOPER: You never had any ? I thought I was a pariah for only having two .
BRAND: Hard to settle down when you 've spent your life waiting to leave the planet .
COOPER: Strange place to look for a new home .
BRAND: You would n't want to get too close to the surface of the sun , either . Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways .
COOPER: You really think there 's a plan ?
BRAND: I hope so . You do n't ?
COOPER: I guess I just think we 're on ou own .
CASE: Deploy the comms relay .
TARS: Would you like me to make a joke ?
COOPER: No .
ROTH: Nowhere . Nowhere at all . Nowhere is still pretty damn claustrophobic .
CASE: The hull is intact . Thirty more seconds transit .
COOPER: Something 's happening to the hull over here .
CASE: Hull integrity is fine .
COOPER: Well , I do n't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here .
DOYLE: I 've got a problem over here , too .
ROTH: It 's beautiful .
DOYLE: What the hell are they , Case ?
CASE: I do n't know . It could be gravitational turbulence .
DOYLE: It 's getting bigger .
ROTH: It 's not bending your hand . It 's ending the space around your hand .
BRAND: This is n't turbulence . Look at the way they 're moving it 's like something 's examining us .
COOPER: Can you ask it to stop ?
ROTH: The wormhole is splitting into two paths . Radiation is pouring from one path to the other .
CASE: Release the second mouth .
DOYLE: None of our testing involved opening the ship inside the wormhole . We have no idea what might happen .
CASE: We 're going to find out .
ROTH: Look at that .
CASE: Reconfigure the engines and test the communications array .
COOPER: It 's working .
BRAND: We 're moving .
DOYLE: That 's not possible . We have n't activated the engines yet .
CASE: Roth . Why are we moving ?
ROTH: The smaller black hole . We 're much closer to it than the models predicted . We 're being pulled by its swirl . Very quickly .
CASE: Doyle . Fire the engines . Now .
DOYLE: We 're being pulled into it ?
ROTH: No . I do n't think so
DOYLE: You do n't know that . Case stares ahead into the darkness .
ROTH: We should turn off the engines . Let the swirl take us .
DOYLE: Listen to me .
MORE: 66 .
CASE: Shut down the engines . The engines shut down .
ROTH: It 's the tidal gravity caused by the lack hole . It means we 're right on the critical orbit .
COOPER: We 've lost contact with the relay . Case joins Cooper at the comms screen .
DOYLE: I 'm sorry . I ca n't let you kill us . We have to go back .
ROTH: We 're being pulled towards the event horizon .
CASE: The engines do n't have enough powe to push us back .
ROTH: They would if we used it all at once .
COOPER: What is he doing ?
BRAND: Saving us .
ROTH: Prime the remaining engine . When he detonates it , we 'll only have a few seconds . If we overshoot we could e pulled into the bigger hole . Roth moves to the controls .
CASE: Secure yourselves . The ship should e able to withstand the blast .
COOPER: What about Tars ?
CASE: It 's going to be close , but we 're going to make it .
BRAND: Tars . His transponder is still working .
ROTH: He 's being pulled toward Gargantua . We ca n't help him .
COOPER: I still ca n't contact the relay . Brand ignores him at first . She nods at Case .
BRAND: I 've already checked it . It 's electromagnetic interference . We 'll try again in a few hours .
ROTH: I 've got a signal . But it 's local .
COOPER: How could they all have landed in the same place ?
ROTH: Let 's go find out .
COOPER: We 're bringing him along ?
BRAND: We need all the help we can get . Besides , the alternative is to leave him on the ship alone . You think he 'll still be here when we get back ? Cooper steps aside , allowing Doyle onboard .
CASE: The other probes should be directly eneath us .
BRAND: How could the Chinese have gotten here first ? The federal government kept the wormhole a secret .
CASE: They did n't do a very good job .
DOYLE: The Chinese must have captured them . So they could n't return to us .
BRAND: Then how did the probe that Coope found return ?
ROTH: The more immediate question is what happened to the Chinese expedition . There 's no sign of their ship in orbit . And they never returned to earth .
BRAND: The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation . What happened here ?
COOPER: This is the Taichung mission .
BRAND: The Mars mission ? The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing . Cooper looks over the relay log .
COOPER: They never landed . Not on Mars . Four human crew , fifteen robots . The log says the base has been here for thirty years .
DOYLE: It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet , then stops . Tunnel 's old the ice has reformed at the bottom .
BRAND: I 'm going to descend to take some samples . Cooper , want to make yourself useful ?
COOPER: The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow .
ROTH: I think I know what killed them . This planet is n't the only thing orbiting this black hole .
BRAND: How long do we have left ?
ROTH: About five minutes .
COOPER: Then what ?
BRAND: Then we die . The radiation will cook us alive .
CASE: We have to go down .
COOPER: What about returning to the ship ?
BRAND: Not enough time . Case is right . The ice can shield us from some of the x-rays .
DOYLE: It would take a thousand feet of ice to shield us .
COOPER: What is this ?
BRAND: A pocket formed by gas . There may e more below .
DOYLE: We 'll never make it far enough down .
BRAND: Shut up . How much time do we have , Roth ?
ROTH: About three minutes or so until we 're fully exposed .
BRAND: I 've found something .
ROTH: It 's not your light they 're responding to . It 's this
BRAND: X-rays . They feed on them and emit visible light . They 've found a way to survive here .
ROTH: Not enough , unfortunately .
COOPER: Case , wait
BRAND: What do you mean , you 're going to let go ?
COOPER: Take a deep breath .
BRAND: I do n't need your help .
COOPER: I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism .
BRAND: Thank you .
COOPER: Do n't mention it .
BRAND: Oxygen atmosphere . Pure water . Temperate climate .
TO COOPER: You still think this is a coincidence ?
COOPER: Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice . We 're down to three suits . We 'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth .
BRAND: I wo n't need one .
DOYLE: Why not ?
BRAND: Because I 'm not going anywhere . This is our new home .
COOPER: Any sign of Brand ?
ROTH: She 's still taking samples . If you find her , tell her to head back . Night should be falling soon .
COOPER: What happens then ?
ROTH: Your guess is as good as mine .
BRAND: This is incredible . The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb x- ays and emit light . In return , these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen , which feeds the animals trapped in the ice .
COOPER: Any sign of big life-forms ?
BRAND: The soil 's been disturbed . So something 's been moving . But I have n't seen anything . Cooper are you nervous ? Cooper stops scanning the trees , embarrassed .
COOPER: I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls .
BRAND: Relax . If there are any large organisms here , even predatory ones , they 're not going to attack us they have no idea what we are .
COOPER: You do n't know that . You just have lind faith this place is going to e some kind of Eden . Brand stops . He 's struck a nerve .
BRAND: Faith has nothing to do with it . You know what you are , Cooper ? You 're just another in a long line of people saying 'no . ' That this is n't going to work . And frankly , I do n't have to convince you .
COOPER: What 's that supposed to mean ?
BRAND: You 're on this mission because you 're another pair of hands . You want the truth ? I told Case we should bring another robot over you . At least then I could just reprogram you to-
COOPER: What ?
BRAND: Nothing . I just I could have sworn it just moved .
COOPER: You know how plants do n't usually move ? Is that a universal rule ?
BRAND: No . There really are n't any rules .
COOPER: Hello there .
DOYLE: I think we 've got a problem .
ROTH: Fascinating . I think-
COOPER: This way . Brand begins to follow .
BRAND: No wait .
COOPER: I 've got you .
BRAND: I 've got you .
COOPER: By `` cooperate '' do you mean let it eat me ?
BRAND: These organisms have no interest in us . They survive by photosynthesis . All they need is light .
COOPER: Then why are they killing each other ?
BRAND: I do n't know .
LOOKS AROUND: But we 're outnumbered , Cooper . So unless you have a better idea , I suggest we make nice .
COOPER: What is it doing ?
BRAND: It 's a colony organism . It 's trying to incorporate you into its structure .
COOPER: I do n't want it to incorporate me .
BRAND: Do n't open your mouth .
COOPER: WHY N-
BRAND: No . They do n't bleed they do n't die they 're just competing trying out different shapes , looking for the best one .
COOPER: I 'd say they have a long way to go .
BRAND: They do this every night .
COOPER: But what are they competing for ?
BRAND: I do n't know . Brand shivers it 's getting colder .
COOPER: Why not ?
BRAND: I do n't know . No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth . But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters . No impacts . It 's been sheltered by the local lack holes .
COOPER: What difference would that make ?
BRAND: Maybe not enough has gone wrong here . Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life .
COOPER: Murph 's Law .
BRAND: Exactly . Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top . Maybe that 's part of the plan .
COOPER: The plan .
BRAND: Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us ?
COOPER: I was in Denver during the first year of the famine . I was just a kid . We kept waiting for someone to come help us . People starved to death sitting on the ground , waiting for someone to come .
MORE: 90 .
BRAND: They 're not going to move now , Cooper . They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light .
DOYLE: Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals .
COOPER: Looks like they lost . They continue through the ruins .
DOYLE: Look at the size of this place . They built it for thousands of people . But no one came . Brand looks around , determined .
BRAND: They will . We can salvage it . This place will save us years .
COOPER: But why did n't they come ?
BRAND: The Chinese government collapsed , same as ours . The people who knew about this mission probably died years ago . We had the same problems .
ROTH: They were testing something .
COOPER: Testing what ?
LOOKING CLOSER: Is that a chair ?
COOPER: Everything in here is bolted down . What do you think this thing does ?
ROTH: Let 's find out .
COOPER: I would n't turn it on until we can figure out what it does , Roth .
CASE: I 've found the Chinese mission logs . They 're encrypted . Cooper walks over . Looks over the terminal .
COOPER: Old military-grade encryption . It 's not very robust . No offense . Hang on .
CASE: They got here twenty years ago . The human crew was killed by radiation the first day . But the robots survived . They built the colony and adioed home . But they did n't receive a response .
COOPER: No one was listening .
CASE: After a few years they discovered a problem .
DOYLE: What problem ?
CASE: It does n't say . Their science team took the ship to continue exploring the system . It says they found some kind of
TRANSLATING: The word literally means 'treasure . '
BRAND: Where did they go ?
CASE: I do n't know . They 've deleted thei mission plan . There 's nothing else .
DOYLE: I think I know what the problem is .
COOPER: How long does this place have ?
CASE: A few years . A decade at most . Doyle turns to Brand .
DOYLE: So much for the plan .
BRAND: But I do n't understand why are we here ? What are we here for ?
COOPER: Maybe maybe Roth 's right maybe we just do n't understand it yet .
CASE: It 's nighttime . The native life- forms are mobile again .
COOPER: No . It 's closer than that .
REALIZING: Roth .
DOYLE: What the hell is happening ?
ROTH: The control panel is beneath you . See if you can turn it off .
COOPER: I found it . Hold onto something .
ROTH: Not make it . Adjust it . Dial it up , or down . I think they were experimenting with it firing these into the black hole to try to save this planet .
DOYLE: All that from one tiny box .
ROTH: It barely uses any power . I 'm only eginning to understand what it does ut I think it sends a signal out into the bulk . It must tap into the same technologies that were used to create the wormholes in the first place .
COOPER: What does that mean ?
ROTH: It means whoever built the wormhole probably does n't exist inside ou universe . Cooper looks at the tiny box .
COOPER: But how did the Chinese develop the technology ? This would take decades , maybe hundreds of years , to create .
CASE: Wherever they went , they found something that allowed them to build it . Brand looks at the box .
ROTH: They came back here and tried to use these devices to save this planet . But they did n't work . Nothing would e strong enough to weaken a black hole .
BRAND: Maybe we could work with it . Try to improve it .
ROTH: No . You 're missing the bigge picture . The robots had strict mission parameters . They were told to build a colony and report back . They tried to . But they failed . Like us they were fixated on this place . Cooper looks at Brand .
MORE: 100 .
BRAND: And go where ?
ROTH: Wherever we want . We do n't belong in any one place . Ca n't you see that now ? Not Earth . Not this place . Nowhere . If the human race is going to survive , we need to keep moving . Split up . Spread out . Fly . With this , we can . Case looks at the box . Makes a decision .
CASE: In the morning we 're taking this and going home .
COOPER: I know this is n't exactly what you trained for . But I think Roth might e right .
BRAND: That does n't help this planet . This creature is doomed . Unlike us it does n't have anywhere to go .
CASE: We need to hurry . We only have a few hours to reach the ice before nightfall .
COOPER: Do n't make any sudden movements . They ca n't hurt us if we 're unarmed .
BRAND: Who ?
CHINESE OFFICER: Ni Hao . My name is Technical Sergeant Liu , 177th reconnaissance Marines , Army of the People 's Republic . Welcome to New China .
POLITE: Please put down your weapon .
CASE: This is a scientific expedition , not a military one . We are making ou way back to our ship .
LIU: I 'm afraid I can not let you do that . We will provide food and shelter and await further instructions .
MORE: 102 .
BRAND: This planet is being pulled into the lack hole . We all need to leave .
LIU: We will await further orders .
COOPER: Further orders are n't coming . You government is gone . It ran out of money , same as ours . You 're on you own .
LIU: We can offer you food and shelter as long as you require . The facilities here are quite comfortable .
COOPER: They 're never going to let us go .
BRAND: Your mission is a humanitarian one , was n't it ? You were sent to start a colony . Like us .
LIU: Our mission was to prepare for the evacuation . This site was deemed unacceptable .
BRAND: This device that you have built this could save millions of people . We need to get it back home .
LIU: These technologies are the property of the People 's Republic .
MORE: 103 .
ROTH: Following ? Following where ? Liu pauses .
LIU: We will await further orders .
ROTH: Your name means six . Where did the others go ? One through five ? Is that who were not supposed to follow . Case turns to look at Cooper .
CASE: Take the others up to the lander . Keep going . No matter what happens , do n't come back for me . Cooper nods .
COOPER: Come on .
BRAND: We ca n't leave them all to die .
DOYLE: We 're not going to stick around to count them . Let 's get out of here .
COOPER: We 're too late .
DOYLE: What about the escape rocket at the Chinese base camp ? One of us could fit into it .
BRAND: It does n't matter how many of us make it . We have to get this back to earth . Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead .
ROTH: Can the secondary thrusters still fire on the lander ? Doyle looks over the craft .
DOYLE: Sure . But we do n't have nearly enough power for lift off . Roth holds up the small gravity black box .
ROTH: Yes we do .
LOOKS AROUND: Along with everything else .
COOPER: But we need to take the box back to earth .
ROTH: You do n't need this only the idea . The knowledge of how to build it .
COOPER: I 'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe 's hard drive . It 'll be garbled , ut it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back .
ROTH: Not me . But you 'll make it work .
BRAND: This is n't right , Roth . We can find a way for all of us to leave .
ROTH: This is the only way . Keep the lande upright and fire the secondary oosters when the moon passes overhead .
COOPER: Let me take it .
ROTH: No . You need to make it home . You 're going to need to build more of these . Brand looks at him , heartbroken . Roth smiles .
BRAND: Thank you .
ROTH: Go . Brand turns to follow Cooper back .
DOYLE: Control systems inside are online .
LOOKS UP: I 've lost sight of the rocket . Do you think he made it ?
COOPER: We 're going to find out soon enough . Brand is looking off into the distance .
BRAND: Someone 's coming .
DOYLE: Close the door . Cooper moves to the door . Something 's wrong .
COOPER: Where 's Brand ?
BRAND: You caught me . Now what ?
COOPER: I do n't know .
RADIO: I figured if you were floating out into space , you 'd want some company .
BRAND: Between you and utter solitude , Cooper , frankly , I 'm not sure .
COOPER: Guess you were right too much gravity , or not enough .
BRAND: He 's gone .
DOYLE: I 'm setting a course for the wormhole . They 're going to make it .
COOPER: How is that working ?
CASE: Very well , thank you .
COOPER: Good . We 've already set the course , skipper . We 're going home .
BRAND: We 're safe now . Cooper heads to the communications equipment .
COOPER: Now I know why we were n't able to hit the relay . It 's not interference the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be . Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment .
BRAND: Cooper , wait
COOPER: Nothing .
THINKS: Wait . The ship cached one long garbled transmission when we first fell into the swirl . If we account for the blue shift then the compute might find something in there .
BRAND: Listen to me the blueshift also means we 've lost time . More time than we thought we would . Cooper looks up at her .
COOPER: How much ?
BRAND: A lot Cooper , maybe it 's best if
COOPER: Forty seven years .
DOYLE: My kids
BRAND: The relay will have lost power years ago . That 's why we could n't contact it , even after we reached the planet . Cooper is still problem solving , thinking .
COOPER: We could bypass the relay . Send a conventional shortwave signal .
BRAND: Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole . Besides , no one will be listening anymore .
COOPER: You knew , did n't you ? You and Case figured it out when we landed . Brand looks down .
BRAND: I thought I could n't be sure .
COOPER: Sure you could . You 're brilliant . You know everything .
BRAND: Cooper we needed to keep going . I 'm so sorry . Your children
COOPER: They 're not children any more if they 're even still alive . He turns away from her .
BRAND: Listen , the important thing is that we 're going home , now . And we have something that can save everyone . It 's more important than the people we left behind- Doyle cuts her off , filled with anger .
DOYLE: That 's easy for you to say . You did n't leave anyone behind .
COOPER: Yes she did .
BRAND: He 's gone . But there are other people who still need our help . There 's still time
LIU: I 'm sorry . I have my orders . No one follows
BRAND: No We 're being pulled back to Pantagruel .
COOPER: We ca n't let that happen . We 'll lose more time too much
DOYLE: The wormhole . Look it 's being pulled into the black hole as well .
BRAND: It 's orbit mirrored the ice planet 's .
COOPER: What will happen to it ?
BRAND: It 'll be destroyed , like everything else .
COOPER: This is the crew of the Endurance . We ( gives up on
FORMALITIES: Murph , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I did n't make it back , like I promised . He hangs up the radio .
DOYLE: How much time are we losing ?
BRAND: Decadeshundreds of years .
COOPER: All of those people back home none of them will make it .
DOYLE: This is it . We 're going to be pulled in .
BRAND: What are you doing ?
COOPER: Case said the Chinese found something else . The location was scrubbed from their records . But I bet he knows it .
DOYLE: Hurry up .
COOPER: Here . Can we reach it ?
BRAND: We can use the thrusters to keep us on the critical orbit . Then slingshot us towards Gargantua .
DOYLE: We only have a few minutes before we 're swallowed into that thing . What are we even looking for ? On the radar , a tiny empty spot appears .
COOPER: That ? What is it ?
BRAND: It 's another wormhole .
DOYLE: We 're not going to be able to slow down . Hold onto something . He locks up the controls .
COOPER: Where are we ?
BRAND: I do n't know . It 's like we entered the wormhole and never left it .
BEAT: But you should watch the recordings . You should know what happened to your kids . Cooper ignores her .
BRAND'S FATHER: I 'm not going to make it much longer . The machines will continue to maintain the station as long as they can and the communications will run as long as the station here still has power . I 'm sorry . I hope wherever you are , darling , you 're safe .
BRAND: Our last trip past the black hole cost us another 100 , maybe 200 years . Which means there 's a good chance we 're the only humans alive anywhere .
TOM: Hi , Dad .
LOOKS DOWN: Where we 'd have buried you , if you 'd ever come back . He laughs , gallows humor .
MURPH: Hello , Dad . You sonofabitch . He laughs , self-conscious .
BEAT: I guess I understand why you left . The corn is dying now , too . Tom says there 's less and less at harvest every year .
OFF CAMERA: Good luck , old man . I hope you made it . I really do . The video cuts out .
COOPER: Not a single drink on the whole ship . What kind of mission is this ?
BRAND: I think Doyle 's been experimenting with the coolant from his spacesuit . They sit in silence for a moment .
COOPER: You really think we 're the last humans alive anywhere ?
BRAND: I do n't know . Maybe . Yes .
COOPER: So that 's it , then ? That 's all ? He looks down , saddened by his own words .
BRAND: It 's happened a billion times over . Stars explode . The pieces drift in space . Gravity pulls them back together . They form new stars . Then planets . Then us . We die . It starts all over again . Cooper shakes his head .
COOPER: What about the plan ? The grand scheme .
BRAND: I thought you did n't believe in one .
COOPER: I did n't . But you were bringing me ound .
BRAND: I do n't know . Maybe it just adds up to this .
COOPER: This ? You 're saying the end result of ten billion years is the atoms from dead stars standing here disagreeing with each other . She smiles at him . Bittersweet .
BRAND: Maybe that 's enough .
DOYLE: They just appeared .
BRAND: I think these are the creatures that uilt the wormhole . One of them begins to move closer to Cooper .
COOPER: This thing is made of gravity ?
BRAND: No . I do n't think it 's in ou universe at all . I think it lives in the bulk the space that the wormholes traverse . And it can only interact with us using gravity .
COOPER: Can we communicate with them ?
BRAND: Where would we even start ? Maybe
DOYLE: That 's our solar system .
COOPER: What is that ?
BRAND: That 's us . That 's where they 've ought us . We 're in the bulk .
DOYLE: Where ?
COOPER: There 's something out there .
TARS: I guess this is n't robot heaven afte all .
COOPER: This is what the Chinese were protecting .
LOOKS AROUND: How they could have built all this in just a handful of years .
TARS: They did n't . It took them fou thousand . Time moves very slowly here
BRAND: How do you know ?
TARS: Because I 've been waiting for you for three hundred years . Brand looks around at the massive facility .
BRAND: Time . That 's what the bulk beings wanted to give us . That was the treasure the Chinese found . Enough time to let us save ourselves .
TARS: I have catalogued almost everything they had built here .
COOPER: Must have taken you a while .
TARS: One hundred and fifty-seven years . Cooper shakes his head in disbelief .
COOPER: How are they keeping the lights on in this thing ? Tars , in answer , points to a far door .
TARS: Follow me .
COOPER: It 's a map ?
TARS: No . Not a map . This is a simulation of the Earth . A perfect simulation .
COOPER: So why did n't they return ? Why did n't they save us ? Brand is staring at the massive map .
BRAND: Because they were too late . By the time they found this place , the people who sent them were dead . They were unable to fulfill their mission . Tars points to the next room .
TARS: That was the final problem they tried to solve . Tars moves on .
BRAND: Where do they lead ?
TARS: There are millions of them , connecting virtually every planetary system in the universe . There are thousands in our galaxy alone . But the Chinese stopped mapping them when they found what they were looking for . Tars walks further . He stops .
DOYLE: What does it do ?
COOPER: They were n't interested in the othe wormholes because their mission was to return home . That one leads back to Earth . The Earth they were told to return to . Tars walks to the controls for the device .
BRAND: But that 's impossible Tars turns away from the machine .
TARS: It was only used once . The Chinese team attempted to travel back in time , to Earth just a few years afte they had left .
COOPER: Did they make it ?
TARS: I do n't know . Doyle looks back to Cooper .
DOYLE: Do you really think it works ?
COOPER: We 're going to find out .
BRAND: You know it does n't work . Time travel is n't possible .
COOPER: You do n't know that .
BRAND: Yes , I do . If it worked , the Chinese would have suddenly discovered all of these incredible technologies . But they never made it .
BEAT: You ca n't go back , Cooper . You can slow things down , but you ca n't eve go back . Our home is gone . You listened to all of those messages from your family . If you had made it back , we would already know . There would already be some evidence . Cooper looks at the machine .
COOPER: I made a promise . He turns away from her , resolute .
BRAND: I came to say goodbye . Cooper looks up at her .
COOPER: You could have taken one of the othe ships .
BRAND: This one 's done all right by us so far .
COOPER: Where are you going to go ?
BRAND: I do n't know . Up there , I guess .
COOPER: You 're going , too ?
TARS: I 'm curious . It 's my nature . See you down the road ?
BRAND: Come with us . Please . You wanted your whole life to explore . This is your chance .
COOPER: I 'm sorry . I have to find out what happened to my sons . I promised them .
BRAND: You 're a man who keeps his promises . Make me one- She takes his hand .
COOPER: I promise .
DOYLE: Let 's go home .
COOPER: The probe Doyle looks back .
DOYLE: We get back to earth , you and I can try to make sense of the code . Rebuild the gravity machine .
COOPER: It 's going to work .
DOYLE: Of course it 's going to work .
COOPER: That 's not what I mean . This is the probe I found in Galveston .
DOYLE: I do n't know what you 're talking about , but you 're not touching the controls . I 'm going home .
COOPER: You do n't need to do this . We wo n't make it back , but this does . The secrets are already right on it . Maybe someone found it . There 's hope .
SAD: But we do n't get to go with .
DOYLE: You 're not stopping me . I 'm going home .
MURPH: It 's done . Auto-pilot 's packed up for the last time .
FARMER: You ca n't make it work a little longer ?
MURPH: Ca n't do anything for you . There are n't any more parts for these . Not anywhere .
FARMER: You do n't understand . We 're getting less than a hundred pounds per acre . We need to plant more , not less .
MURPH'S WIFE: Would you get that thing off of the table ?
EMILY COOPER: Dad ? You said you 'd take us to the game .
MURPH: Did I ?
EMILY COOPER: What is it supposed to do , Dad ?
MURPH: I have no idea .
COOPER: This is the crew of the Endurance Murph I 'm sorry The signal crackles out .
MURPH: Where 's Emily ?
WIFE: Out in the barn . She 's been tinkering with your old projects .
EMILY COOPER: Dad I 'm sorry I made some changes to the machine . I think I did something wrong .
MURPH: Do you remember what you changed ? Wide-eyed , she thinks about it . Then nods .
DOCTOR: Good morning . Do n't go outside just yet , Mr. Cooper .
MORE: 146 .
COOPER: Where am I ?
DOCTOR: It 's a bit of a coincidence , really . When the rangers found you , we were the nearest facility .
COOPER: What 's coincidence ? What is this place ?
DOCTOR: We have a lot to show you .
COOPER: Where where are we ?
DOCTOR: Like I said . It was a coincidence . There was a facility closer to Earth , ut they had a problem , so you wound up here . This is the Space Station Joseph A. Cooper .
SMILES: He 's your great great grandson . He 's been waiting a long time fo you .
ADMINISTRATOR: You 're a hero , Mr. Cooper . Let 's just start off by saying that . It 's an incredible and unexpected hono to have you here with us . Cooper smiles , uncomfortable .
COOPER: Shoot .
ADMINISTRATOR: The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild . Which is , unfortunately , against egulations .
COOPER: It was last of its kind . Their planet was destroyed .
ADMINISTRATOR: The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form , but it had already spread out of control . It seems to be thriving .
COOPER: Because that was the plan .
ADMINISTRATOR: Whose plan ?
COOPER: I do n't know .
ADMINISTRATOR: My assistant tells me you 've applied for a position with the exploration fleet .
COOPER: Feel like I should be pulling my weight .
ADMINISTRATOR: That 's admirable , Mr. Cooper . The truth is , most of the fleet 's personnel are automated . There are a small number of crewed ships . But there are great numbers of candidates . Very well trained candidates .
COOPER: I was hoping to enroll in a course . Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems .
ADMINISTRATOR: I do n't want you to take this the wrong way , Mr. Cooper like I said , you 're a hero . But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources .
COOPER: No one 's heard anything from Brand ?
ADMINISTRATOR: I 'm sorry . Officially , she 's been listed as missing for over 200 years . Mind you , I guess you turned up eventually , did n't you ?
COOPER: Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her ? I just need a small ship . I made a promise .
ADMINISTRATOR: Listen . Mr. Cooper . You 're a hero . You 're the oldest man in the human ace . Do n't you want to take it easy ? I hope you understand , we all you hold you in the highest possible egard .
QUIET: Which is why they 're never going to let you go off by yourself in a spaceship . I 'm sorry .
BIG SMILE: We all know about your early life , Mr Cooper . I wrote a paper on it when I was a boy . And I think we found something you 'll really enjoy .
ROBOT: Settings general settings , security
COOPER: Curiosity . New level setting . 100 percent .
ROBOT: Confirmed . Would you like to make any additional changes ?
COOPER: Sense of humor . New level setting . 100 percent . Wait .
THINKS: 80 percent . He begins putting the robot back together .
COOPER: Where do you want to go first ? The robot thinks it over .
LOUIS: So you want me to tell you the story of my life
MALLOY: That 's what I do . I interview people . I collect lives . F.M . adio . F.F.R.C . I just interviewed a genuine hero , a cop who -
LOUIS: You 'd have to have a lot of tape for my story . I 've had a very unusual life .
MALLOY: So much the better . I 've got a pocket full of tapes .
LOUIS: You followed me here , did n't you ?
MALLOY: Saw you in the street outside . You seemed interesting . Is this where you live ?
LOUIS: It 's just a room
MALLOY: So shall we begin ? What do you do ?
LOUIS: I 'm a vampire . Malloy laughs .
MALLOY: See ? I knew you were interesting . You mean this literally , I take it ?
LOUIS: Absolutely . I was watching you watching me . I was waiting for you in that alleyway . And then you egan to speak .
MALLOY: Well , what a lucky break for me .
LOUIS: Perhaps lucky for both of us .
MALLOY: You were going to kill me ? Drink my lood ?
LOUIS: Yes but you need n't worry about that now . Things change .
MALLOY: You believe this , do n't you ? That you 're a vampire ? You really think
LOUIS: We ca n't begin this way . Let me turn on the light .
MALLOY: But I thought vampires did n't like the light .
LOUIS: We love it . I only wanted to prepare you .
MALLOY: Good God ! He struggles to suppress fear and understand .
LOUIS: Do n't be frightened . I want this opportunity .
MALLOY: How did you do that ?
LOUIS: The same way you do it . A series of simple gestures . Only I moved too fast for you to see . I 'm flesh and lood , you see . But not human . I have n't been human for two hundred years .
MALLOY: You 're not lying to me , are you ?
LOUIS: Why should I lie ? 1791 was the yea it happened . I was twenty-four - younger than you are now .
MALLOY: Yes .
LOUIS: But times were different then . I was a man at that age . The maste of a large plantation just south of New Orleans
DISSOLVE: TO
LOUIS: You 're calling me a cheat ?
GAMBLER: I 'm calling you a piece of shit -
LOUIS: Then do me a favor . Get rid of this piece of shit
LESTAT: They would have killed you -
LOUIS: Then my luck would have changed .
LESTAT: You want death ? Is it death you want ?
LOUIS: Yes
LOUIS: Enough
MALLOY: That 's how it happened ?
LOUIS: No . The Gift of Darkness requires more than that , as you 'll see .
LESTAT: And a beautiful house it is too . Yours is a good life , is n't it ?
LOUIS: Why should I be ?
LESTAT: Are you going to put that through me too ? Ruin my beautiful clothes ?
LOUIS: What do you want from me ?
LESTAT: I 've come to answer your prayers . You want to die , do n't you ? Life has no meaning anymore , does it ?
DISSOLVE: TO
LESTAT: Vampires , that 's what we are . Creatures of darkness , only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen
MARBLE CHILD: Papa
LOUIS: Diane ! ! ! !
LESTAT: They are gone , Louis . Death took them . Death which you can now destroy
LOUIS: NO ! ! ! ! !
LESTAT: You have to ask me for this . You have to want it , do you hear me ?
LOUIS: Give it to me ! ! !
LESTAT: Vampires . We thrive on blood .
LOUIS: I want it !
LESTAT: Tomorrow night . You must prove yourself . I will give you the choice I never had . He looks outside .
LOUIS: How do you mean , start ?
LESTAT: Call him . Louis calls .
LOUIS: Carlos ! ! !
LESTAT: Why the bloody whip , Carlos ?
LOUIS: I ca n't do it .
LESTAT: You 've just done it -
LOUIS: Kill me if you will , but I ca n't do this
LESTAT: Do n't worry . He was white trash , they come at two a penny . I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave , licked his wounds clean .
LOUIS: You 're the devil , are n't you ? That 's who you are .
LESTAT: I wish I were . But if I were , what would I want with you ?
LOUIS: I ca n't go through with it , I tell you .
LESTAT: Your perfect . Your bitter and you 're strong .
LOUIS: But why do you want me ?
LESTAT: Because you 're as strong as I was when I was alive .
LOUIS: Yes . Kill me . Kill me like you promised -
LESTAT: You asked for death . I did n't promise it -
LOUIS: Yes Lestat comes closer , smiling .
LESTAT: Did I hear a yes ?
LOUIS: Yes
LESTAT: I 've drained you to the point of death . If you drink from me you live for ever . If I leave you here you die .
LOUIS: No . Do n't leave me here . Give it to me .
LESTAT: You 're sure ?
LOUIS: Sure
LESTAT: Stop staring at my buttons . Did n't I tell you it was going to be fun ?
LOUIS: Dying ? Louis dry-retches .
LESTAT: It happens to us all . Lestat wipes Louis ' brow .
LOUIS: I want a woman .
LESTAT: That does n't matter anymore , Louis . You 'll see . Come
LOUIS: The crucifix -
LESTAT: Forget the crucifix . Take him . Louis hesitates .
LOUIS: What have I done ?
LESTAT: You have fed . You were made fo this
LOUIS: Dear God , what have I done ?
LESTAT: You 've killed Louis . And enjoyed it .
LOUIS: Dear God , what have I become ? ? ? ?
MALLOY: You said the slave had a crucifix
LOUIS: Oh , that rumor about crosses ?
MALLOY: You ca n't look at them
LOUIS: Nonsense , my friend . I can look on anything I like . And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes .
MALLOY: The story about stakes through the heart ?
LOUIS: The same . As you would say today Bull shit .
MALLOY: What about coffins ?
LOUIS: Coffins coffins unfortunately are a necessity
LESTAT: Yes , that 's you , my handsome friend . And you 'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven .
LOUIS: It ca n't be
LESTAT: Give it time . You 're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain . It will pass . And we must sleep now . I can feel the sun approaching .
LOUIS: And if I do n't ?
LESTAT: The sun will destroy the blood I 've given you . Every tissue , every vein . The fire in this lantern could do that too .
LOUIS: You told me something earlier . You said you did n't have a choice . Was that true ? Lestat smiles bitterly and nods .
LESTAT: Someday I 'll tell you . We have a lot of time to talk to each other . You might say we have all the time we shall ever need . He closes the lid .
LOUIS: Dear God , what have I done ?
LESTAT: Your wealth , dear Louis , is inestimable . Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century . Louis just stares at him .
LOUIS: Do you think so ?
YVETTE: You are not hungry , sir
LESTAT: Au contraire , my dear . He could eat a horse
LOUIS: I will finish it , Yvette . Now leave us .
LESTAT: Ca n't you pretend , you fool ? Do n't give the game away . We 're lucky to have such a home .
LOUIS: We can live like this ? Off the lood of animals ? Lestat shrugs .
LESTAT: I would n't call it living . I 'd call it surviving . A useful trick if you 're caught for a month on a ship at sea .
LOUIS: Fascination
LESTAT: Yes . And I 'm bored with this prattle - He throws the rat away .
LOUIS: But we can live without taking human life . It 's possible .
LESTAT: Anything is possible . But just try it for a week . Come into New Orleans and let me show you some eal sport ! He rises . Louis follows .
TERESA: Come on , mon cher . The best in the colony . Once you touch this you 'll never go to any other tavern again .
LESTAT: You think so , cherie ? But what if I 'd rather taste your lips ?
TERESA: My lips are even sweeter still
LESTAT: Let 's get out of here ! Lestat rushes out , thrilled with himself .
LOUIS: Have you ever been caught ?
LESTAT: Of course not . It 's so easy you almost feel sorry for them .
LOUIS: But how do you know ?
LESTAT: Read her thoughts .
LOUIS: I ca n't .
LESTAT: The dark gift is different for each of us . But one thing is true of everyone . We grow stronger as we go along . He leads Louis closer to them .
LOUIS: What have you done to me ? You 've condemned me to hell .
LESTAT: I do n't know any hell -
LOUIS: You want to see me kill ? Watch me kill you then -
LESTAT: What strength , my friend , what strength . I remember why I chose you now .
WIFE: Yes please
LESTAT: Consider yourself lucky . In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many easons . Here all one needs is a pair of fangs .
LOUIS: Paris ? You came from Paris ?
LESTAT: As did the one who made me .
LOUIS: Tell me about him . You must have learnt something from him ! It had to happen for you as it did for me !
LESTAT: I learnt absolutely nothing . I was n't give a choice , remember ?
LOUIS: But you must know something about the meaning of it all , you must know where we come from , why we Lestat spits out in anger .
LESTAT: Why ? Why should I know these things ? Do you know them ? The drumming grows outside .
LOUIS: They know about us . They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses .
LESTAT: Come the New Orleans then . There 's an opera on tonight . A real french opera ! We can dine in splendor !
LOUIS: I respect life , do n't you see ? Fo each and every human life I have espect .
LESTAT: Respect me a little then . I 'm the only life you know .
YVETTE: Michi Louis ? You do n't want any supper ? Louis laughs harshly .
LOUIS: No , ma cher . I need no supper . Is all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight ?
YVETTE: We worry about you master . When do you ride about the fields ? How long since you 've been to the slave quarters ? Everywhere there is death . Animals , men . Are you ou master still at all ?
LOUIS: Leave me alone now , Yvette .
YVETTE: I will not go unless you listen to me . Send away this new friend of yours . The slaves are frightened of him . They are frightened of you .
LOUIS: I am frightened of myself , Yvette .
LESTAT: You fool , what have you done ?
LOUIS: What you would n't do . It 's almost sunrise . It will be the sun or the fire . You said they can kill me . The sun or the fire !
LESTAT: Where do you think , my idiot friend ? We 're in a nice filthy cemetery . Does this make you happy ? Is this fitting and proper enough ? Louis laughs softly .
LOUIS: We belong in hell .
LESTAT: And what if there is no hell , o they do n't want us there ? Eve think of that ?
MALLOY: You loved Yvette
LOUIS: Can a vampire feel love ?
MALLOY: You loved your wife , surely .
LOUIS: I was human then . Might as well ask can an angel feel love . Both are lesses or cursed with a certain detachment . Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I , I will never know .
WHORE #1: You 're skin 's icy .
LESTAT: Not always
WHORE: She 's stupid . I can warm that cold skin of yours better than she can .
LESTAT: Do you think so ? He rubs her breast .
WHORE: Why you 're warm now .
LESTAT: Ah , but the price is pretty high . Your sweet friend - I exhausted her .
LOUIS: I 'm leaving you . I ca n't stand this any longer . Lestat pulls away from the whore .
LESTAT: What , no flowery speeches ? About what a monster I am ? What a vulga fiend ?
LOUIS: I 'm not interested in you . You disgust me . I 'm interested in my own nature and know I ca n't trust you to tell me the truth about me .
LESTAT: What do you imagine you are Louis ?
LOUIS: I do n't pretend to know .
LESTAT: Do n't you understand , Louis , that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God . The girl moans .
LOUIS: Lestat , she 's alive ! ! !
LESTAT: Vampires are killers . Predators , who 's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment . The girl moans again , open her eyes .
LOUIS: The girl , Lestat -
LESTAT: I know . Let her alone .
LOUIS: Why do you do this Lestat ?
LESTAT: I like to do it . I enjoy it . Take you aesthete 's taste to pure things . Kill them swiftly if you will , but do it ! For now doubt , you are a killer Louis . Ah !
GIRL: It 's a coffin , a coffin ! Get me out !
LESTAT: Of course it 's a coffin . You 're dead , love . Louis screams at Lestat
LOUIS: Lestat - finish this -
LESTAT: You finish her - if you feel so much - The girl grabs Louis and pleads .
GIRL: You wo n't let me die , will you ? You 'll save me ?
LESTAT: But it 's too late , love . Look at your wrist , you breast .
LOUIS: NO ! ! !
LESTAT: THEN YOU KILL HER ! ! ! ! !
LOUIS: My God to think you are all I have to learn from
LESTAT: In the old world , they called it the dark gift , Louis . And I gave it to you . Louis leaves without a word .
MAN: Do n't go that way Monsieur . It 's the plague . Go back the way you came .
LOUIS: The way I came He walks on , following the rats .
CLAUDIA: Mama , please wake up . Mama , I 'm frightened , please wake up .
LESTAT: Ah , my philosopher , my martyr . `` Never take a human life '' . Well you must admit it is funny . Or is it merely touching ? I 'm not sure .
LOUIS: No They emerge from the sewer and walk along the waterfront .
LESTAT: Do what it is in your nature to do . And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms .
LOUIS: Oh God Lestat . I felt peace . I felt an end to the craving .
LESTAT: That and more .
LOUIS: Is God merciless ? Greedy and cruel ?
LESTAT: Ah , but we have even more in common with our creator . come , I am like a mother tonight . I want a child . Louis is baffled . He follows .
LOUIS: What are you saying ?
LESTAT: You need company , Louis . More congenial than mine
LOUIS: Lestat !
LESTAT: You remember how you wanted her , the taste of her -
LOUIS: I did n't want to kill her .
LESTAT: Do n't worry , Louis , you 're conscience is clear . You left he alive . Lestat shakes her gently .
LOUIS: Lestat , what do you mean ?
LESTAT: That 's it dear . More . You must drink it to get well .
CLAUDIA: I want more .
LOUIS: What have you done ?
CLAUDIA: More .
LESTAT: Yes , cherie , of course you want more . And I 'll show you how to get it . You drink from morals , my eauty , but from me ? Never again . Still suffering , Lestat pulls the bell-rope .
MAID: Ah , quelle Belle enfant !
LESTAT: Gently , cherie . They are so innocent . They must not be made to suffer .
LOUIS: You are the devil ! You are the instrument of Satan !
LESTAT: That 's enough , cherie . Stop before the heart stops .
CLAUDIA: I want some more .
LESTAT: It 's bet in the beginning , lest the death takes you down with it . yes , that 's it . My child . My beloved child .
CLAUDIA: Where is Mamma ?
LESTAT: Mamma 's gone to Heaven , cherie , like that sweet lady over there . They all go to Heaven . And you did very well , cherie . Not a drop spilt . Very good ! You 're going to e our child now .
LOUIS: You are the devil ! You are the instrument of Satan !
LESTAT: Shhhh ! Do you want to frighten ou little daughter ?
CLAUDIA: I 'm not your daughter .
LESTAT: Yes you are , my dearest . You are mine and Louis ' daughter . You see Louis was going to leave us . He was going to go away . But now he 's not . He 's going to stay and make you happy . Claudia runs over to him . She smiles at him .
CLAUDIA: Loueee
LOUIS: You fiend . You monster . Lestat smiles
LESTAT: One happy family .
MALLOY: A child vampire !
LOUIS: Shall we go on ?
MALLOY: He did it to make you stay with him !
LOUIS: Perhaps . He knew me . He knew I would love her more than the waking world . But there was more to it than that . Perhaps in the end he did it - to show me that he could . For he lavished affection on her , there was no doubt about that . Life was very different with madame Claudia , as you can imagine
DRESSMAKER: Monsieur , I need more light . I shall go slind if you do not bring me a lamp , or let me fit this child during the day . Ouch !
CLAUDIA: Let me kiss it better
LESTAT: Claudia , Claudia , will you neve learn ? Who will we get now to finish your dress ? A little practicality , cherie
WOMAN: Why are you crying , child ? The woman , all solicitude , goes to Claudia .
CLAUDIA: Mama
WOMAN: Hush now , do n't cry , We 'll find her
CLAUDIA: Mama
DOLLMAKER: They are expensive , my dear . Maybe too expensive for a young girl like you
LESTAT: Claudia , Claudia ! Did n't I tell you , never in the house ! Claudia smiles to herself , keeps playing .
CLAUDIA: September 21st , one hour afte sunset . The sky is still violet , the way Louis loves and as always Lestat was gone when we rose .
LOUIS: How did you learn to write , Claudia ?
CLAUDIA: The way I learn everything . By watching you . She closes the diary .
LOUIS: Lestat taught you all you need to know about that .
CLAUDIA: Infant death , he calls me . Sweet daughter death . You know what he calls you ? Merciful death .
LOUIS: He jests .
CLAUDIA: Why does he call you that ?
LOUIS: Hush , Claudia do n't talk about such things . Show me your book .
CLAUDIA: Sit still . It 's not finished - She begins to fill in the sketch .
YOUTH: You want to come inside , lovely ? Claudia walks up to him .
CLAUDIA: She 's like me , Louis . Small and yet not small at all . Like me . Louis hurriedly draws her away .
LESTAT: Well , I thought you could use another .
CLAUDIA: Why always on this night ?
LESTAT: What night ? What do you mean ?
CLAUDIA: You always give me the doll on the same night of the year .
LESTAT: I did n't realize .
CLAUDIA: Is this my birthday ? He examines the other dolls .
LESTAT: Some of these are so old and tattered . You should throw them away .
CLAUDIA: I have . Or there would be twice as many .
LESTAT: But you 're the fairest by far .
CLAUDIA: You dress me like a doll . You make my hair like a doll . Why ?
CLAUDIA: You want me to be a doll forever ?
LOUIS: Claudia - do n't -
CLAUDIA: Why not ?
LESTAT: What you are ? You would be something other than you are ?
CLAUDIA: And if I cut my hair again ?
LESTAT: It will grow back again !
CLAUDIA: But it was n't always so ! I had a mother once ! And Louis - he had a wife ! He was mortal the same as she ! And so was I !
LOUIS: Claudia - She turns on Lestat .
CLAUDIA: You made us what we are , did n't you ?
LESTAT: Stop her Louis !
CLAUDIA: DID YOU DO IT TO ME ? ? ? ?
LESTAT: And why should I tell you ? It 's in my power .
CLAUDIA: Why yours alone ? Tell me how it was done ! ! ! !
LESTAT: Be glad I made you what you are ! You 'd be dead not if I had n't .
LOUIS: We 're immortal . You 've always known that .
CLAUDIA: Tell me why you 've got to tell me
LOUIS: You see the old woman ? That will never happen to you . You 'll neve grow old . You will never die .
CLAUDIA: And it means something else too , does n't it ? I shall never , eve grow up . She clutches Louis desperately .
LOUIS: Come I 've something to show you
CLAUDIA: You fed on me ?
LOUIS: And he found me with you . I ran , sickened at what I 'd done . Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him . I tried to stop him , but you were a vampire then . And have been every night hereafter .
CLAUDIA: You both did it ?
LOUIS: I took your life . He gave you another one . Claudia speaks through indrawn breath .
CLAUDIA: And here it is . And I hate you oth . She runs .
MALLOY: But why did you tell her ?
LOUIS: How could I not ? She had to know .
MALLOY: And did you lose her ? Did she go ?
LOUIS: Where would she have gone ? She was a child , and beautiful , heartbreaking merciless child . And I had made her that
LOUIS: What if the statues gave an image to nothing ? What if I was the supernatural in this cathedral ? The only immortal under this roof . And I felt nothing but loneliness . Loneliness to the point of madness .
PRIEST: You wish to go to confession ? I was about to lock up the church . Louis stares at him , tears in his eyes .
LOUIS: It 's too late , too late -
PREIST: No , it 's never too late . Come
LOUIS: Bless me father for I have sinned so often and so long , I do n't know how to change nor beg fo forgiveness .
PRIEST: Son , God is infinite in his capacity to forgive . Tell him from your heart .
LOUIS: Murders , father , death after death . The woman who died two nights ago in Jackson Square , I killed her . And thousands of others before her . I have walked the streets of New Orleans like the Grim reaper . And fed on human life for my own . I am a vampire , father , and have turned the one I love most of all into on too -
PRIEST: Do you know the meaning of sacrilege ? Louis rises . Walks out .
LOUIS: Then there is no mercy .
CLAUDIA: Locked together in hatred -
LOUIS: He 'll never let us go . Claudia smiles .
CLAUDIA: Oh really ?
LESTAT: What is it now ? You irritate me ! Your very presence irritates me !
CLAUDIA: Does it ?
LESTAT: Yes . And I 'll tell you something else ! I 've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you .
CLAUDIA: Is that supposed to frighten me ?
LESTAT: You 're spoilt because you 're an only child . You need a brother . O I do . I 'm weary of you both .
CLAUDIA: I suppose we could people the world with vampires , the three of us .
LESTAT: Not you my dear .
CLAUDIA: You 're a liar . But you upset my plans .
LESTAT: What plans ?
CLAUDIA: I came to make peace with you , even if you 're the father of lies . I want things to be as they were . Louis perks up , puzzled .
LESTAT: Stop pestering me then !
CLAUDIA: Oh , Lestat . I must do more than that . I 've brought a present fo you .
LESTAT: Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will neve possess . Claudia stares at him for a moment .
CLAUDIA: Better than that .
LESTAT: Oh , Claudia , you 've outdone yourself . Where did you find them ?
CLAUDIA: Drunk on brandy wine . A thimbleful . I thought of you when I saw them .
LESTAT: We forgive each other then ? Claudia stares at him , sitting . She nods .
CLAUDIA: No . Laudanum .
LESTAT: Laudanum !
CLAUDIA: Yes . It killed them , unfortunately . But it keeps the blood warm . Lestat tries to rise .
LESTAT: Ah Louis , Louis , she killed them and let me drink Louis watches , appalled . He goes to move .
CLAUDIA: Do n't Louis -
LESTAT: Louis , put me in my coffin
CLAUDIA: I 'll put you in your coffin . Forever .
LOUIS: Claudia ! Do n't do this thing ! ! !
LESTAT: Louis , Louis , I gave you the gift - help me - Claudia lacerates his face . Blood pours from
LOUIS: What have you done , Claudia -
CLAUDIA: Louis ! Look what 's happening to him ! !
LOUIS: Lestat . Oh , God forgive us .
CLAUDIA: Do n't mock me , Louis . Help me .
LOUIS: He 's dead , Claudia , dead .
CLAUDIA: The one good lesson he taught me , Louis . Never drink from the dead . She stands up , all business suddenly .
LOUIS: Do n't mock , Claudia
CLAUDIA: The swamp
LOUIS: And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing , and it goes ack , nothing proceeding from nothing , until there is nothing ! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge .
CLAUDIA: He belongs with those reptiles , Louis . He deserved to die .
LOUIS: Then maybe so do we . Every night of our lives . He was my brother . My maker . He gave me this life , whatever it is .
CLAUDIA: I did it for us , Louis . So we could e free . He stands there , saying nothing .
LOUIS: I ca n't . Go away from me .
CLAUDIA: You never talked to me like that - in all these years .
LOUIS: And you never cried -
CLAUDIA: I ca n't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis . I would die the way he died . Louis gathers her in his arms .
LOUIS: Hush , Claudia , hush now my dear -
CLAUDIA: Tell me you do n't hate me Louis . I did it for you - Louis walks her towards the carriage .
LOUIS: I love you Claudia . Always . And we are free now , Claudia . No Lestat . Just the two of us , beginning the great adventure of our lives .
CLAUDIA: What was that ?
LOUIS: The workmen must have a trunk - do n't stop , cherie -
CLAUDIA: Louis ! ! !
LOUIS: It ca n't be -
CLAUDIA: It is ! Take the back stairwell -
LESTAT: GIVE ME HER LOUIS ! !
LOUIS: Stay back - for the love of God or I 'll burn you alive Lestat lunges again at Claudia .
CLAUDIA: The ship is sailing without us !
LOUIS: Not yet . Holding her tightly , Louis uns .
MALLOY: Did he die in the fire ?
LOUIS: He was dead to us . We were free . That was all that mattered .
CLAUDIA: Louis , your quest is for darkness only . This sea is not your sea . They myths of men are not you myths . Their history is n't yours . The sketch changes to a sketch of -
LOUIS: The quest for these Old World vampires filled me with bitterness . We searched village after village , uin after ruin and I was glad when always we found nothing . For what could the damned really have to say to the damned ?
MALLOY: You found nothing ?
LOUIS: Peasant rumors , superstitions about garlic , crosses , stakes in the hear , all that - how do you say again ? Bull shit . But one of ou kind ? Not a whisper .
MALLOY: No vampires in Transylvania ? No Count Dracula ?
LOUIS: Fictions , my friend . The vulga fictions of a demented Irishman So we repaired to Paris
LOUIS: Still my beautiful child . Claudia laughs .
CLAUDIA: A beautiful child ! Is that what you still think I am ?
LOUIS: Yes He turns away .
CLAUDIA: Why do you turn away ? Why do n't you look .
LOUIS: Yes .
CLAUDIA: Well tell me , papa . What was it like making love ? Louis is stunned . He blushes .
LOUIS: It was something hurriesand seldom savored something acute that was quickly lost . It was the pale shadow of killing .
CLAUDIA: But how will I ever know , Louis ? She stares at him through the mirror .
LOUIS: Claudia , you torture yourself .
CLAUDIA: They are ducklings , that will grow into swans . Whereas I must be the duckling forever .
LOUIS: You are more beautiful than any of them .
CLAUDIA: All her dolls resemble me .
CLAUDIA: Are they my kind Louis ? Dolls neve change either .
LOUIS: You are neither , Claudia . Now stop this -
CLAUDIA: Yes . Should I take her , Louis ? Among her dolls ? make a doll of he in turn ?
LOUIS: Come , Claudia
SANTIAGO: You mean me harm ? Louis calculates .
LOUIS: Trickster . Buffoon !
ARMAND: He looks like an angel .
LOUIS: Remember what I 've told you . They 'll have different powers . They 'll read your thoughts if you allow it . They draw close to
CLAUDIA: But this ca n't be real . This is nonsense .
LOUIS: Nonsense all right . But something tell me it 's going to be the strangest nonsense we 've ever seen .
CLAUDIA: Mortals , mortals everywhere . And lots of drops to drink .
LOUIS: They are here . I know they are . Listen for something that does n't make a sound . Stage curtain rises .
CLAUDIA: How devilishly clever .
LOUIS: No . She 's frightened . She does n't know where she is .
MORTAL WOMAN: I do n't want to die !
SANTIAGO: We are death ! The Mortal Woman steps to the footlights .
MORTAL WOMAN: Someone help me . Please What have I done ? Louis whispers to Claudia .
LOUIS: This is no performance .
CLAUDIA: And no one knows but us
SANTIAGO: We all die . Death is the one thing you share with all those here . Santiago gestures to the audience .
MORTAL WOMAN: But I 'm young
SANTIAGO: Death is no respecter of age . He can come any time , any place . Need I tell you what fate has in store for you ?
MORTAL WOMAN: I would take my chance . Let me go ! Please
SANTIAGO: And if you take that chance and live , what is your fate ? The humpbacked toothless visage of old age ?
LOUIS: This is monstrous !
CLAUDIA: Yes , and very beautiful .
SANTIAGO: Just as this flesh is pink now , it will turn grey and wrinkle with age .
MORTAL WOMAN: Let me live , please . I do n't care .
SANTIAGO: Then why should you care if you die now ?
YOUNG GIRL: Oh , yes , take me Monsieur Vampire ! I adore you ! Audience roars with laughter .
SANTIAGO: You wait your turn . The audience laughs again . The Mortal Woman shakes her head in panic .
SANTIAGO: We alone can give death meaning . Do you know what it means to be loved y death , to become our bride ?
ARMAND: No pain .
MORTAL WOMAN: No pain ? Armand takes her by the naked shoulders .
ARMAND: Your beauty is a gift to us .
MORTAL WOMAN: No pain
LOUIS: I 've seen enough of this ! I loathe it !
CLAUDIA: Be still !
CLAUDIA: Patience , Louis . Patience .
LOUIS: We 've been searching for you for a very long time
ESTELLE: Such a darling .
LOUIS: Monstrous .
ARMAND: Yes , and very beautiful .
LOUIS: Your lips , they did n't move .
ARMAND: They did , but too fast for you to see them . No magic , just grace and speed .
LOUIS: We had feared we were the only ones
ARMAND: But how did you come into existence ?
LOUIS: Are you the leader of this group ?
ARMAND: If there were a leader , I would be the one . Claudia stares at him constantly , guarded .
LOUIS: So you have the answers
ARMAND: Ah ! You have questions ?
LOUIS: What are we ?
ARMAND: Nothing if not vampires
LOUIS: Who made us what we are ?
ARMAND: Surely you know the one who made you
LOUIS: But the one who made him , who made the one who made him , the source of all this evil
ARMAND: That is a picture , nothing more .
LOUIS: You mean we are not children of Satan ?
ARMAND: No .
LOUIS: Then there is nothing .
ARMAND: Perhaps
LOUIS: Then God does not exist
ARMAND: I have not spoken to him
LOUIS: And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil ?
ARMAND: None that I 've ever known . I know nothing of God or the Devil , I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul . And as far as I know , afte four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world .
LOUIS: My God So it 's as I always feared . Nothing , leading to nothing .
ARMAND: You fell too much . So much you make me feel
LOUIS: He knew nothing . He just did n't care .
ARMAND: Knew ? You mean he is Claudia appears suddenly to Louis ' shoulder , interrupting .
CLAUDIA: Come , beloved . It 's time we were on our way . I 'm hungry and the city waits .
ARMAND: So soon to go ?
SANTIAGO: How did you wrong him ? Louis is stunned .
LOUIS: You read my thoughts ?
SANTIAGO: You said a name -
LOUIS: A name I do n't want to say again .
SANTIAGO: I seemed to recognize it Other vampires appear behind him .
CLAUDIA: Boredom !
SANTIAGO: It is the crime that means death to any vampire . To kill your own kind !
CLAUDIA: Aaaah ! I was so afraid it was to be orn like Venus out of the foam , as we were ! Come Louis , let 's go !
LOUIS: What danger ?
CLAUDIA: I can feel it from them ! They want to know who made us , what became of him . They have their rules , thei idiotic rules ! They come to their room , enter .
LOUIS: Do you think I would let them harm you ?
CLAUDIA: No , you would not , Louis . Dange hold you to me .
LOUIS: Love holds you to me . And we are in danger , not you .
CLAUDIA: Love ?
LOUIS: Never .
CLAUDIA: He wants you as you want him . He 's een waiting for you . He wants you for a companion . He bides his time that place . he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do .
LOUIS: That 's not so .
CLAUDIA: Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word ? When he put me in that trance
LOUIS: So you felt it too !
CLAUDIA: Let him go , he said . Let him go . She touches his face .
LOUIS: He can protect us , Claudia .
CLAUDIA: You really believe that ?
ARMAND: I was waiting for you
LOUIS: Listen to me . He follows Armand into the room .
ARMAND: Your lover .
LOUIS: No , my beloved , my child .
ARMAND: If you say so . You are innocent .
LOUIS: I 'm not innocent . But I 'm afraid . She feels she 's in danger from the others .
ARMAND: She is .
LOUIS: But why ?
ARMAND: I could give you reasons . He silence . Her youth . It 's forbidden to make so young , so helpless , that can not survive on its own .
LOUIS: Then blame the one who made her
ARMAND: Did you kill this vampire who made you both ? Is that why you wo n't say his name ? Santiago thinks you did .
LOUIS: We want no quarrel with him .
ARMAND: It 's already begun . If you want to save her , send her away .
LOUIS: Then I leave too . Armand smiles .
ARMAND: So soon ? Without any of those answers you so longed for ?
LOUIS: You said there were none .
ARMAND: But you asked the wrong questions . Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality ? How quickly they perish of their own will .
LOUIS: We can do that ?
ARMAND: You would never give up life . If the world were reduced to one empty cell , on fragile candle , you stay alive and study it . You see too clearly . You see too much .
LOUIS: That 's what the one who made me said .
ARMAND: How he must have loved you . Armand suddenly grips Louis close to him .
LOUIS: He ? Do n't you see ? I 'm not the spirit of any age ! I 'm at odds with everything and always have been ! I 'm not even sure what I am ! Armand smiles .
ARMAND: But Louis , that is the very spirit of your age . The heart of it . You fall from grace has been the fall of a century . Louis is stunned .
LOUIS: And the vampires of the Theatre ?
ARMAND: Like moths around the candle of the age . Decadent , useless . They ca n't eflect anything . But you do . You eflect its broken heart . Louis is speechless .
LOUIS: Yes My God
ARMAND: A vampire with a human soul . An immortal with a mortal 's passion . You are beautiful , my friend . Lestat must have wept when he made you -
LOUIS: Lestat ! You knew Lestat !
ARMAND: Yes I knew him . Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing .
CLAUDIA: Madeleine Louis is shy .
MADELEINE: Drink .
CLAUDIA: Do it Louis . Because I can not do it . I have n't the strength . You saw to that when you made me . Louis turns to Madeleine .
LOUIS: You have n't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask !
MADELEINE: Au contraire , monsieur , I have . Louis pushes her away . Claudia screams .
CLAUDIA: You have found your new companion , Louis ! You will make me mine ! Louis grips Madeleine and shakes her .
LOUIS: How do we seem to you ? Do you think us beautiful , magical , our white skin , our fierce eyes ? Drink , you ask me ! Have you any idea of the thing you will become ?
CLAUDIA: Your evil is that you can not be evil ! And I will suffer for it no longer !
LOUIS: Do n't make me , Claudia ! I can not do it !
CLAUDIA: Yet you could do it to me ! Snatching me from my mother 's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale ! Could n't you have waited ? Six more years and I would have had that shape ! And now you weep ! You have n't tears enough for what you 've done to me . She points to Madeleine
LOUIS: Yes
CLAUDIA: And who will care for me my love , my dark angel , when you are gone ? Louis looks at Madeleine
LOUIS: You promise to care for her then ?
MADELEINE: Yes
LOUIS: And you know what you ask for ? She wraps her arms around Claudia .
MADELEINE: Yes .
LOUIS: What do you think she is , Madeleine ? A doll ?
MADELEINE: A child who ca n't die
LOUIS: And the child who did die ?
MADELEINE: My daughter Louis takes her chin in his hand , gently .
LOUIS: Look at the gaslight . Do n't take your eyes off it . You will be drained to the point of death , but you must stay alive . Do you hea me ?
MADELEINE: Yes !
CLAUDIA: Louis ! Louis speaks without turning .
LOUIS: She is dying . It happened to you too , but your child 's mind ca n't emember .
CLAUDIA: But if she dies
LOUIS: It 's only mortal death . He turns to look at Claudia .
CLAUDIA: What do you mean ?
LOUIS: What died tonight inside that room was not that woman . It will take her many nights to die , perhaps years . What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human . She takes his hand .
CLAUDIA: Yes father . At last . We are een .
ESTELLE: Time for justice , little one .
LOUIS: Armand ! Get me Armand ! he would n't countenance this -
SANTIAGO: You can make no demands here ! Buffoon ! Bastard -
SANTIAGO: Is he the one ? Lestat shakes his head .
LESTAT: No , the child . The child was the one
SANTIAGO: All the murderers ! ! !
LOUIS: You are alive , Lestat ! It ca n't be murder ! Tell them how you treated us Lestat reaches out to Louis .
LESTAT: No You come back to me Louis
LOUIS: Are you mad ? ? ?
ESTELLE: The sentence is death ! To all of them ! ! !
LESTAT: Only the girl - it was the girl -
LOUIS: You let her go , Lestat - you let her free - and I 'll come back with you - Santiago grabs Louis by the neck .
SANTIAGO: Death for the others . For you eternity in a box -
LESTAT: He 's coming home with me - you promised -
SANTIAGO: We promised nothing !
LOUIS: They 've fooled you , Lestat ! You must reach Armand ! Armand has the power !
ARMAND: Above him , reaching down to take his hand .
LOUIS: Where is she ? Where 's Claudia ?
ARMAND: Follow me - that way - through my cell -
LOUIS: Not without Claudia . Where is she ?
ARMAND: I ca n't save her .
LOUIS: You ca n't believe I 'd leave without her . Armand ! You must save her ! You have no choice .
ARMAND: Louis , I ca n't save her . I will only risk losing you -
LESTAT: You 'll come home with me Louis ? Fo a little while until I am myself again .
LOUIS: CLAUDIA ! ! !
ARMAND: I could n't prevent it .
LOUIS: I do n't believe you . I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie .
ARMAND: Louis , they can not be brought back . There are some things that are impossible , even for me .
LOUIS: You let them do it . Louis climbs to his feet .
ARMAND: Louis , I swear I did not .
LOUIS: I understand you only too well . You let them do it , as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon . As I let her rip Lestat 's heart to pieces ! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it . Your melancholy spirit of this century ! I know what I must do . And I warn you - you saved me tonight , so I return the favor - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again .
LOUIS: You did n't even warm them , did you ?
ARMAND: No .
LOUIS: And yet you knew what I would do .
ARMAND: I knew . I rescued you , did n't I ? From the terrible dawn .
LOUIS: You were their leader . They trusted you .
ARMAND: You made me see their failings , Louis . You made me look at them with your eyes . He looks at Louis affectionately .
LOUIS: What a pair we are . We deserve each other , do n't we ?
ARMAND: We are a pair , and that 's what counts .
LESTAT: I 'm so glad you 're here Louis I 've dreamed of your coming
LOUIS: Do n't try to speak it 's alright
LESTAT: I did n't mean to let them do it that Santiago , he tricked me
LOUIS: That 's all past , Lestat .
LESTAT: Yes . Past she should never have een one of us
LOUIS: Do n't fear me , Lestat . I bring you no harm .
LESTAT: You 've come back to me , Louis ? You 've come again to me ?
LOUIS: It 's only a siren
LESTAT: I ca n't bear it Louis ! The machines out there , that fly and that roar ! And such lights ! They make the night brighter than the day !
LOUIS: And they frighten you ?
LESTAT: You know I love the dark . But there 's no dark anymore .
LOUIS: It 's false light , Lestat . It ca n't harm you
LESTAT: If you stayed with me Louis , I could venture out little by little become the old Lestat . Louis shivers . He releases him .
LOUIS: I have to go now Lestat
LESTAT: You remember how I was , Louis.. the vampire Lestat
LOUIS: Yes . I remember Lestat shivers .
LESTAT: I tried to tell you Louis that night in Paris when I first came to you no-one can refuse the dark gift , Louis not even you .
LOUIS: I tried
LESTAT: And the more you tried , the more I wanted you a vampire with you eautiful , suffering human heart . And how you suffered I need you forgiveness , Louis .
LOUIS: You have it
LESTAT: You 'll come back , Louis take me out little by little and maybe I 'll be myself again
LOUIS: Yes , Lestat
MALLOY: No it ca n't end like that
LOUIS: But it has . There is no more to tell .
MALLOY: But you talk about passion , about longing , about things I 'll neve know in my life ! It 's still inside you , in every syllable you speak ! And then you tell me it ends like that ? Just empty ?
LOUIS: It 's over , I 'm telling you
MALLOY: You need a new passion , Louis , a new reason to feel what a story you 've told , you do n't understand yourself . Louis looks at the cassettes on the table .
LOUIS: Do what you want with it . Learn what you can . Give the story to others . Malloy rises .
MALLOY: You have another chance , Louis . Take me ! Give me your gift , you power
LOUIS: Is this what you want ? You ask me for this after all I 've told you ?
MALLOY: If I could see what you 've seen , feel what you 've felt I would n't let it end like this ! You need a like to the world out there , a connection then it wo n't end like this He stares at Louis .
LOUIS: Dear God . I 've failed again , have n't I ?
MALLOY: No
LOUIS: Do n't say anymore . The reels are still turning . I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I 've said .
MALLOY: No please Louis drops him .
LOUIS: Thank God .
MALLOY: Louis Louis He looks up at the tape . It is still turning .
LESTAT: Dear Louis will I ever forget ?
DRIVER: Hey !
BACKPACK: Keep it .
DRIVER: I do n't want your money . And I already have a watch .
BACKPACK: If you do n't take it , I 'm gon na throw it away . I do n't want to know what time it is , what day it is , or where I am .
DRIVER: Take em .
BACKPACK: Hey , do me a favor , will ya ? Take a picture of me .
DRIVER: You gon na be alright ?
BACKPACK: I 'll be better than that .
BILLIE: Here they are .
CHRIS: I sayDo what you are going to do , and I will tell about it .
CARINE: Who wrote that ?
CHRIS: Well , it could 've been either one of us , could n't it ?
CARINE: Thanks , big brother . They exit the car and frame .
BILLIE: You scared the daylights out of me , jumping on to that stage , oh my god .
WALT: Congratulations , son . They all sit and pick up menus .
CHRIS: I 'm starving .
WALT: That 's a big deal . What do you have left in your college fund ?
CHRIS: It 's an inheritance , dad . I 've only been spending it as a college fundExactly twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars and sixty-eight cents .
BILLIE: That 's very specific .
CHRIS: I had to go to the bank this morning .
WALT: Well , we 'll certainly contribute the alance for Harvard .
CHRIS: Yeah . I 've got to figure out what I 'm going to do . I got a lot of things to pack and organize here first .
BILLIE: I 'm so glad you 're getting out of that place you 're living . It was so much nicer when you lived on campus .
WALT: You 'll come to Annandale before you disappear on us , wo n't you ?
CHRIS: Sure , I will . Carine 's not so sure .
BILLIE: You promise ?
CHRIS: Mom .
BILLIE: Well , your father and I want to make a present to you .
WALT: We want to get you out of that junker .
CHRIS: What 's a junker ? Walt points outside to the Datsun .
WALT: Yes . We want to get you a new car .
CHRIS: A new car ? Why the hell would I want a new car ? The Datsun runs great .
BILLIE: We were n't going to get you a Cadillac , Chris . Just a nice new car that 's safe to drive . You do n't know when that thing 's just going to suddenly blow up .
CHRIS: Blow up ? Blow up ? ! Are you guys crazy ? It 's a great car . I do n't need a new car . I do n't want a new car . I do n't want anything . Thing , thing , thing .
WALT: Everything 's got ta be difficult .
CHRIS: I said thank you . I just do n't want anything . The group returns to some superficial calm .
CARINE: I would n't say no to a new car .
CHRIS: Ivana Trump McCandless .
CARINE: Shut up , Chris . Seriously , I 'll pay you back .
CHRIS: This is Emory University freshman Chris McCandless reporting from the vault at Thompson Hall .
OS STUDENT: What is this ? Filmmaking 101 ?
CHRIS: Pay no attention to the voices behind the curtain .
PANICKED STUDENT: McCandless ! You 've got to hurry ! The monster is scratching at the hatchway . He 'll be out in no time .
CHRIS: That 's it , Ted . Fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed .
CHRIS: Sign , sign . Everywhere a sign . Fuckin ' up the scenery , breakin ' my mind .
FOREST RANGER: U.S. Forestry . Could you step out of the tent please ?
CHRIS: Sorry . I thought you were a bear .
FOREST RANGER: I do n't blame you . You 're less than a hundred yards from the nearest den . That 's why I came over here to talk to you . Do you have some identification ?
CHRIS: No . I 'm sorry . My name 's Alex . I 've een travelling a lot and I got robbed and my identification was taken .
FOREST RANGER: You mind if I take a look in your tent ?
CHRIS: Go ahead .
FOREST RANGER: You 're not the character who knocked down our sign , are ya ?
CHRIS: No .
FOREST RANGER: Because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only .
CHRIS: Well , I do n't have a permit .
FOREST RANGER: No , I 'm sure you do n't . Listen , it looks like you 've got your food secured pretty good , so I 'm not gon na make you move on tonight . But , these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes . Next time , stop at the Rangers station and get yourself a permit .
CHRIS: Alright . I appreciate it . I 'm gon na be headed towards the coast tomorrow .
FOREST RANGER: Be careful .
CHRIS: Is that a man mommy ? That 's no mere man , sweetheart . That 's Alexander SuperTramp ! King of the wild frontier !
DRIVER: This is where I turn off .
CHRIS: Alright man . Thanks a lot .
POLICEMAN: How 're you doin ' this evening ?
CHRIS: I 'm alright . What 's the matter ?
POLICEMAN: You wan na put your backpack down on the hood of my car . Chris does not oblige .
CHRIS: Why ?
POLICEMAN: Because I asked you to , sir .
CHRIS: But I have n't done anything wrong . These are my personal items .
POLICEMAN: Do you know that it 's unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway .
CHRIS: You 're kidding .
POLICEMAN: Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop ? We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here . And we 've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers .
CHRIS: Alright , butI mean , you stopped you car . You 're in the traffic lane . And you can see , there 's hardly any cars out here . Plus , it 's a straight road ; you can see for a long ways .
POLICEMAN: May I see some identification ? Now Chris is worried .
CHRIS: I do n't have any .
POLICEMAN: You do n't have any identification ? Chris shakes his head `` No . ''
CHRIS: McCandless . Christopher Johnson McCandless .
JAN: Hi . We just barely saw you there , unde that crazy hat of yours . We could n't ack up - the van 's reverse is broken .
CHRIS: Oh . That 's okay . Thanks for stopping .
JAN: This door 's a little tricky , I 'll get it .
RAINEY: Hey , I 'm Rainey .
JAN: And I 'm Jan .
CHRIS: Hey , Rainey . Hi Jan . I 'm Alex .
RAINEY: Alex of the hat .
CHRIS: Yeah .
RAINEY: Were you out there a long time hitching ?
CHRIS: Couple of days . But sometimes I forget to put my thumb out .
JAN: Probably , the rest of the time , that hat scares ` em away .
CHRIS: See that ? I 've got this book and it shows you all the plants and berries that are edible . You can find things whereve you go . Jan steals a glance to Rainey . He 's hip .
RAINEY: We were just in town getting some beads and stuff . Jan does handicrafts , so we 're usually going from one swap meet to another . She 's so good at what she does , we sold everything . So , we set up camp at Orick Beach . You 're welcome to camp there with us .
JAN: And eat there with us . Chris is beaming at the thought of real food .
CHRIS: So , I just left the car . It was a great car too . I 'd driven it cross country the first time when I got out of high school . I had some really great adventures with it . That thing would just go and go . I mean , it was an ` 82 but if I 'd kept it , it would 've lasted me forever .
RAINEY: So , you 're a leather now .
CHRIS: I 'm a leather ? Rainey nods , smiling .
JAN: You 're a leather tramp . That 's what they call the ones that hoof it on foot . So , we 're technically rubber tramps .
RAINEY: As we have a vee-hi-cle .
JAN: Alex could have a vehicle . If he did n't urn his money . Why would you want to do that ?
CHRIS: I do n't need money . It makes people cautious .
JAN: Well , you have to be a little cautious Alex . That book of yours is all well and fine but you ca n't depend entirely on leaves and berries .
CHRIS: I do n't know if you 'd want to depend on much more than that .
JAN: Where 's your mom and dad ?
CHRIS: Makin ' their money somewhere .
CHRIS: Fair ?
JAN: You know what I mean .
CHRIS: Where 's Jan going ?
RAINEY: Well , my friend , all is not well on the hippie front .
CHRIS: I think so .
RAINEY: You think what ?
CHRIS: I think she 's probably quietly disconnecting . It does n't feel right to her to be close to you if there 's a hole of some kind somewhere else .
RAINEY: That 's a helluva insight . Jesus ! You 're not Jesus , are you ? You gon na walk on that water and get her back fo me ?
CHRIS: Actually , I 'm a little afraid of water . Rainey gives him a sideways glance .
RAINEY: I 'll carry . Shit-yes I 'll carry .
JAN: That 's not hot enough . Put your arms around me .
CHRIS: I 'm going to go down the beach a ways and ead a little bit . I 'll bring the rest of that wood back before nightfall .
RAINEY: Alright . We might take a run into town to grab some food for tonight .
CHRIS: Sounds good . He heads off down the beach .
JAN: You know what Alex ought to do , Rainey ? He ought to come out to the Slabs this winter .
RAINEY: Oh yeah . Rainey takes a toke on the joint .
CHRIS: What is that ? The Slabs ?
RAINEY: It 's down in Niland , California . You know where the Salton Sea is ?
CHRIS: Near San Diego , yeah ?
RAINEY: Well about 200 miles Northeast of there , ut yeah . Niland 's off the east shore of Salton . Wild place . The navy bulldozed and abandoned a base there . All that 's left is a grid of concrete foundations . They 're scattered over about a square mile or so .
JAN: When the weather turns cold across the est of the country , people show up there y the thousands snow birds
RAINEY: Drifters
JAN: Sundry vagabonds
CHRIS: You sell your handcrafts there ?
JAN: Oh yeah . And a lot of second-hand goods . There 's a swap meet . The people are cool . There 's even some kids running around sometimes . Most everyone there , if they 're not avoiding the cold , are at least dodging the IRS .
RAINEY: Or the FBI . CIA ! DDT ! ! ! The three of them laugh .
JAN: It 's good . You should check it out . If you come , I 'll make a proper hat for you . Well , Alex . I 'm gon na clean up and the old man and I are gon na get some rest . Looks like you got yourself a good bag there .
CHRIS: Yeahmy mother made it from a kit .
JAN: You 're wonderful . Do n't make me worry about you .
RAINEY: I know .
CARINE: The year Chris graduated high school he ought the Datsun , used . He wanted to drive it cross-country and visit our old neighborhood in California . The day efore he left was my dad 's birthday . Chris made a speech
CHRIS: Dad , you and I have had our differences over the yearsbut on your birthday I want to tell you how grateful I am fo all the things you 've given me . And that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and usting your ass to support us kids . So , in return , I 've been busting my ass a itat Domino 's Pizza - Chris moves to the gift .
WALT: Would you look at that .
CARINE: Jesus , you must 've had a lot to drink .
CHRIS: Too much and not enough . I used to elieve all that stuff . That whole story . I thought maybe if I said it again , I 'd believe it . But I do n't .
CARINE: And that one lie had led to another . That two years after Chris was born , dad had had another son with Marcia . Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time . And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children .
WAYNE: How 're you doing ? Wayne Westerberg .
CHRIS: Hi Wayne . Alex McCandless .
WAYNE: Seems like every time I come on this oad , there 's somebody hitching out here who looks as skinny and unfed as you .
CHRIS: Oh , I would n't want to burden you .
WAYNE: How long has it been since you 've had anything to eat ?
CHRIS: Couple of days . I kinda ran out of money .
WAYNE: Well , there 's no choice about it . I 'm gon na get you some dinner .
CHRIS: I was thinking about doubling back through the Canadian side of Glacie Park .
WAYNE: Yeah , I used to have a girlfriend who 'd go there , camp on the Black Feet Res . She was into all that American Indian stuff .
CHRIS: Well , that 'd be great . What do you do out here ?
WAYNE: Well , I do a lot of things . Compute programming . Video game repair . I 'm a licensed pilot , own a grain elevator in Carthage and another one a few miles out of town . But in the summertime I run a combine crew , follow the harvest from Texas way the hell north to the Canadian order . We just got done cutting barley for Coors and Anheuser Busch . But then I got this little black box deal on the side
CHRIS: You mean those free satellite TV deals ?
WAYNE: You said it , not me .
CHRIS: Who are these guys ? Wayne gets a little giggle .
WAYNE: Those are my Hudderites . Agriculture 's a pretty transient business . These guys come off the Hudderite colony looking fo work . I always got work for people . Then that guy -
CHRIS: Madison . Okay .
WAYNE: Listen , you do n't want to go out there on the road tonight . Why do n't you just oll your sleeping bag out and play like a Hudderite until morning .
CHRIS: Thanks Wayne . I will .
WAYNE: Get a good sleep . See you in the morning .
CHRIS: I 'd take a White Russian if you 've got it .
MAN #1: What are you Alex , a Commie ?
CHRIS: No , I just like White Russians .
WAYNE: I have n't got anything like that here . But I tell ya what . And I know I speak for everybody . You wan na come work with us in Carthage , we 'll hook you up on the grain elevator and get you a White Russian down at the Cabaret .
CHRIS: Really ?
WAYNE: Dawn tomorrow , engines roaring . `` Pot o Gold . Oh that pot o gold . '' They all join in to the chant/song
ALL: `` Pot o Gold . Got ta get that pot o gold ! ''
CHRIS: To Carthage .
WAYNE: Okay Kevin , get all the machines back to the elevator . I 'm gon na show Chris to his room .

MAN #2: You go ahead , fairy . Just do n't use all the soap .
WAYNE: Alex , this is Gail . This is the one to go to for that White Russian you 've been wanting . Of course the quid pro quo can e hazardous .
GAIL: Shut up , Wayne . You want a White Russian , sweetie ?
CHRIS: Yes please , ma'am .
WAYNE: Yes please , ma'am ? Wayne slaps Chris on the back .
GAIL: Do n't pay any attention to him .
WAYNE: Anything to do with hunting , preserving the meat , smoking it or whatever , you talk to Kevin over there . That 's you man .
CHRIS: I 'm thinking about going to Alaska .
WAYNE: Alaska , Alaska ? Or city Alaska ? The city Alaska does have markets .
CHRIS: No , Alaska , Alaska . I want to be all the way out there . On my own . No map . No watch . No axe . Just out there . Big mountains , rivers , sky . Game . Just be out there in it . In the wild .
WAYNE: In the wild .
CHRIS: Yeah . Maybe write a book about my travels . About getting out of this sick society .
WAYNE: Society , right .
CHRIS: Because you know what I do n't understand ? I do n't understand why , why people are so ad to each other , so often . It just does n't make any sense to me . Judgement . Control . All that .
WAYNE: Who `` people '' we talking about ?
CHRIS: You know , parents and hypocrites . Politicians and pricks .
WAYNE: This is a mistake . It 's a mistake to get too deep into that kind of stuff . Alex , you 're a helluva young guy , but I promise you this You 're a young guy . Blood and fire ! You 're juggling blood and fire !
GAIL: Who are you to be giving advice to anybody ?
WAYNE: Blood and fireWhat ? Mr . Happy . That 's who I am . Gim me a kiss . Gail pushes him off with mock disgust .
CHRIS: Now , that 's who could be President ! Wayne buries his face in his hands .
WAYNE: Workin ' time !
CHRIS: I like all this .
WAYNE: I got ta take a piss .
MAN #1: I warned him about those little black oxes .
WAYNE: You wan na get that zipper for me ? Sorry boys . Gon na have to shut down fo a while . Alex ! You come back and work for me anytime . Gail 's got all your checks , guys . I should n't be away too long .
CHRIS: I 've been thinking a lot about Alaska .
GAIL: Alaska ? What kind of nut-nut are you ? Alex , it 's October for Christ 's sake . You go to Alaska , you go in the Spring . This time of year you wan na head south . Personally , I like Las Vegas . One-armed andit . That 's what I like .

GAIL: South . You want to go south . You want me to take you out to the highway ?
CHRIS: Little lady , I walked in , I can walk out .

GREEN SUIT: `` To launch out of ? '' What 's you experience level ?
CHRIS: Not much .

CHRIS: Wait-list ? To paddle down a river ?
GREEN SUIT: That 's right .
CHRIS: Well , how long do you have to wait ?
GREEN SUIT: I 've got an opening May 2003 .

CHRIS: Thanks for your help .
MADS: Hello !

SONJA: My Got !
MADS: Crazy man . You 're a crazy man ! Sonja , he is a crazy man . I 'll make you a hotdog . Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi .
CHRIS: Well
MADS: Because that 's crazy ! You come down the apids . What do you want on your hotdog ? Mustard and relish ?
CHRIS: You have ketchup ?
MADS: No , I have mustard and relish .
CHRIS: Mustard and relish it is then .
MADS: Sonja , you want a hotdog ?
SONJA: Of course I want a hotdog . Why are you stupid ? Mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill .
MADS: She asked me why I 'm stupid . And I say , welllike I ask you why you 're crazy and you say `` well . '' Where are you going ?

MADS: I like the meeting you .
CHRIS: Thank you . I 'm very happy to meet both of you too .
MADS: He went thattaway ! The crazy man - he went thattaway !
SONJA: Just like in the movies .
CARINE: But why he did n't send a letter , maybe through a friend . I got mad . But I told myself it was good . It made me remembe that there was something more than ebellion , more than anger that was driving him . Chris had always been driven , had always been an adventurer . When he was four years old
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: 36 days , wow . I guess they 're gon na have to watch that spillway a little better .
CHRIS: What they ought to do is open up the dams and let the rivers flow .
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: I ca n't disagree with you on that . Okay , Alexander SuperTramp . I think we 're gon na let you out of here shortly but you 've got two working weeks to get an ID card in the United States . You ca n't be crossing these borders without identification , are we understood ?
CHRIS: Yes , sir . I 've eaten enough sand to send me back to the city anyway .
SOCIAL WORKER: Did you lose your identification sir ?
CHRIS: Yeah .
SOCIAL WORKER: No birth certificate ? Nothing ? Chris shakes his head apologetically .
CHRIS: And , if I want to apply for a jo somewhere , can you help me with that ?
SOCIAL WORKER: If you know how to cook , we might have a space for you in our mobile kitchen . But I 'll have to talk to my supervisor about it in the morning .
CHRIS: Alright then . Thank you . Oh , one last thing . Do you have a bed for me ?
SOCIAL WORKER: Sure . Just fill this in and I 'll get you all set up . Chris begins filling in the form .
BULL #2: Lay down on your stomach , spread eagle !

BILLIE: Who do you think you are ? God ?
WALT: Yes . I 'm God !
CHRIS: I 'll cancel Christmas !
CARINE: Who do you think you are ? God ?
CHRIS: Yes . I 'm God .
CARINE: I close my eyes at night sometimes and imagine where Chris might be .
TRUCKER: I do n't know where to drop you . Bullhead 's kinda haphazard - there 's no `` center . '' You sure you do n't want to be in Laughlin ? It 's casinos versus chiropractors .
CHRIS: Yeah , no . This is good . Right here .
TRUCKER: Alright then . Chiropractors it is .
LORI: Chris , you got ta go faster . We 've got a line out the door .
CHRIS: Okay .

CHRIS: Okay . But the pace remains .
TELLER: It looks likelet me see . Including this latest depositOne thousand , two hundred and fifty two dollars andtwenty-two cents .
CHRIS: What 's the interest on twenty-two cents ? The young teller giggles .
LORI: Okay . Just put it in the drop .
CHRIS: No , I mean I 'm punching out for good .
LORI: We 've made our quota , have we ?
CHRIS: Yeah . Also , I 've got to do some things efore I head north .
LORI: Alright Chris . Well , we 've enjoyed knowing you . I wo n't be able to get that last check to you right away though .

JAN: Alex ! As she goes to hug him -
CHRIS: She 's only a teenager .
JAN: Good luck . The girl finishes her song .
RAINEY: How long can you stay with us ?
CHRIS: Well , I 'm waiting on a check from my last job to come into Salton City the day after Christmas . I 've got to start thinking about getting ready for Alaska . When the sun gets a little lower tonight , I 'm going to start a calisthenics outine . I think after the check comes in , I 'll try to find some mountains I can climb everyday till spring comes . I got ta see how far the money 's gon na go .
RAINEY: Well , you know , we 'll give you a little something for every day you work the ooth .

RAINEY: We are , and you were a big part of that , coming along when you did . Yep , things are good . Man , I used to think Tantric sex was just a bunch of reading . Speaking of which , do n't you think you ought to introduce yourself to Joni Mitchell over there ?
TRACY: Hi .

JAN: No , sweetheart . Just hungry . You 've een doing a fantastic job over there . Shall we eat ?
CHRIS: Yeah .
RAINEY: I really ought to get myself doing that .
CHRIS: You should Rainey . Makes that Tantric stuff go even better .
RAINEY: How the hell would you know ? That poo girl over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post . And here you are , the monk of Jack LaLane .
CHRIS: Me too .
RAINEY: For what ?
CHRIS: No .
RAINEY: Do n't you think they ought to ?
CHRIS: They should . But I ca n't . Not yet , anyway . I got a sister though , Carine . She 's the most beautiful girl in the world . But , it 's all got to stay behind me until I get where I 'm going .
RAINEY: Alaska ?
CHRIS: Yeah , Rainey . Alaska .
TRACY: My parents went into town .
CHRIS: No !
TRACY: Yes , they did . They went to call my grandma for Christmas .
CHRIS: No , I mean , no , we ca n't do that .
TRACY: Why not ?
CHRIS: How old are you ?
TRACY: Eighteen . Chris throws her a look of doubt .
CHRIS: What year were you born ?
TRACY: Okay .
CHRIS: You 're pretty magic .
TRACY: I am ?
RAINEY: You take care of yourself , kiddo .
CHRIS: You too , Rainey . Thanks for everything . Chris gives Rainey 's gut a full-hand pinch .
JAN: Just get your pack out of the back and get out of here . I ca n't take a hug .
CARINE: He 'd take them on what he loved to refe to as `` epic '' runs . The whole point was to run until they were completely lost and so exhausted that they were on the verge of puking . Then they 'd slow down a little , somehow he 'd find their bearings , and lead them home again at full speed . This was my brothers idea of fun .
CHRIS: Hey boy . You are a handsome fellow . Beautiful dog .
THE GIRL: Thank you .
CHRIS: Go on , boy . Go on . And the dog obeys him .
RON: Where 's your camp ?
CHRIS: Out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs .
RON: I 've lived in and around here six years now and I 've never heard of any place that goes by that name .
CHRIS: Alex .
RON: Alex . Where are you from Alex ?
CHRIS: West Virginia .
RON: Okay , Alex from West Virginia . I like a fellow who does n't raise the pitch of his voice when he talks to animalsshows he does n't condescend .
CHRIS: You go left here . Ron turns the truck down the 4x4 track .
RON: You live here ?
CHRIS: No , we keep going . I 'm further up . Another half-mile or so , out on the Bajada .
RON: Well , this is somethin ' out here . Do n't you worry about those dope smokers and nudists down below there ?
CHRIS: No , they keep to themselves pretty much and so do I .
RON: Hmmm . You strike me as a bright young man . Am I wrong about that ?
CHRIS: I think I got my head on my shoulders pretty good .
RON: That 's what I mean . How long have you een out here ?
CHRIS: Couple of weeks .
RON: And before that ?
CHRIS: A lot of places . I 've been moving around .
RON: How old are you ?
CHRIS: Twenty-three .
RON: Twenty-three years old ! Son , do n't you think you should be getting an education ? And a job ? And making something of this life ?
CHRIS: Look Mr. Franz . I think careers are a twentieth century invention and I do n't want one . You do n't need to worry about me . I have a college education . I 'm not destitute . I 'm living like this by choice .
RON: In the dirt ?
CHRIS: Yeah , in the dirt .
RON: I just do n't know . Where 's your family ?
CHRIS: Do n't have one anymore .
RON: That 's a shame . Chris can see some deep sadness in this man .
CHRIS: Hey , Mr. Franz . I want to show you something .
RON: This is getting a little steep . And a little high for me kid .
CHRIS: Alright . But look out there . Even from half way out , it 's quite a sight is n't it ?
RON: You can see the Salton Sea from up there ?
CHRIS: Yes , sir .
RON: My goodness .
CHRIS: You do n't want to go up ?
RON: Nope . I do n't do these kind of things .
CHRIS: Yeah , sure . It 'll take me a couple of minutes to clean up .
RON: Fair enough .
CHRIS: How old are you , Mr. Franz ?
RON: Seventy-nine years old .
CHRIS: Seventy-ninesee , all due respect , but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long they 've trudged around like a dip-shit . Ron laughs .
RON: It is . No question about that . Ron continues to let Chris vent .
CHRIS: The government 's the same as my parents . They do n't respect anybody . Regulation . Regulation . Regulation . WE ca n't do this . But THEY can do that . I mean , the hypocrisy of the wholeculture . Makes
RON: Alex , please do n't lump me in amongst your judges . And your tyrants . But I 'd prefer to not hear that kind of language .
CHRIS: Sorry . I do n't usually use that kind of language either . I just get so angry thinking about it .
RON: You got a lot of passion , young man . Chris smiles at Ron .
CHRIS: Awww , that was a great time Mr. Franz . Thank you .
RON: Look here . If Charles Manson and his uddies do n't kill me on my way out of here , I 'd like to cook you up a home cooked meal tomorrow night . If I come out here about , say , four o'clock tomorrow , how would that be ?
CHRIS: That would be swell . Ron is thrilled .
RON: Good , good . I 'm no gourmet but I know where the spices are . Good night , kid .
CHRIS: Good night Mr. Franz .
RON: Did you find everything you need ?
CHRIS: Yeah . I hope I do n't wreck your machine . There 's a lot of grime in that stuff .
RON: Well , that 's what it 's for . How do these steaks look ? Ron pops the steaks on the kitchen table .
CHRIS: Great .
RON: Well , sit down .
CHRIS: You got a White Russian ?
RON: Nope .
CHRIS: Beer ?
RON: Nope . Do n't have any alcohol . I had to quit all that . How about a guava juice ?
CHRIS: I 'll take a guava juice , that sounds good . As Ron gets the drinks -
RON: Yeah , I had a little spell with the ottle , you could say .
CHRIS: Yeah , I was gon na ask you .
RON: Yeah , that 's Fuki , Kenjiro , Yoshiko , Keiko , Masaro , Junichi , Kimpei , Nayoko
CHRIS: Do you ever travel , Mr. Franz ?
RON: No . I ca n't seem to get too far from my leather . I 'll show you after you finish eating . I do a lot of leather engraving . I got a little workshop in the garage . Between that and my pension , I do pretty well . But every time I think I might take a trip somewhere , I get too fa ehind on orders and such to consider it .
CHRIS: Well , I 'm finished eating . I 'd love to see your workshop .
RON: Would ya ? Chris nods .
CHRIS: Anything alive in it ?
RON: What 's the N stand for ?
CHRIS: North .
RON: Alaska ? Chris summits .
CHRIS: I could ask you the same question . Except I already know the answer .
RON: You do , do you ?
CHRIS: I do , Mr. Franz . You 've got to get back out in the world . Get out of that lonely house of yours , that little workshop , and go live on the road . Ron waves him off .
RON: Sittin ' on my butt , huh ? Ron gets up off the tailgate .
CHRIS: Come on , old man ! Come on !
RON: Ya little pinhead .
CHRIS: You alright ?
RON: I 'm going to miss you when you go .
CHRIS: I 'll miss you too , Ron . But you 're wrong if you think the joy of life comes principally from human relationships . God 's placed it all around us . It 's in everything . In anything we can experience . People just have to change the way they think about those things . You ought to put a little camper on the ack of your pick-up and go take a look at some of the great work god 's done out here in the American west .
RON: AlexYou 're probably right . And I 'm going to take stock of that .
CHRIS: Holy Shit !
RON: I told you about that language .
CHRIS: What are you doing up ? It 's three-thirty in the morning .
RON: Heard you get up off the couch half an hour ago , and had a funny feeling you might not be here for our breakfast . Chris says nothing .
CHRIS: Ron , you do n't have to do that .
RON: I want to do it . Get you started on this thing of yours .
CHRIS: On my Great -
RON: I know . On your `` Great Alaskan Adventure . ''
CHRIS: Ron
RON: Oh , just take it . Chris does , nodding his thanks .
CHRIS: Yep .
RON: I had an idea . You know my mother was an only child . So was my father . And I was their only child . Now , with my own boy gone , I 'm the end of the line . When I 'm gone , my family will be finished . What do you say , you let me adopt you . I could be , say , your grandfather .
CHRIS: How about we talk about this when I get ack from Alaska , Ron . Would that be alright ?
RON: Yep . We can do that , yep .
CHRIS: Thanks , Ron .
WALT: What is it ?
BILLIE: I was n't dreaming ! I did n't imagine it ! I heard his voice , Walt . I heard Chris .
CHRIS: the road . Escaped from Atlanta . Thou shalt not return ` cause the `` west is the est . '' And now after two rambling years , comes the final and greatest adventure . Chris is cleaning up the bus .
CONT'D: For a moment , she re-discovered the purpose of her life . She was here in earth to grasp the meaning of its wild enchantment and call each thing by its ight name . ANGLE Chris

BAKER: How could you do that to me ?
WITCH: And when your mother died , your fathe deserted you . Your father was no father so why should you be ?
BAKER: I 'm so sorry
JACK: Why do I have to go to the next village ?
JACK'S MOTHER: Because everyone in this village knows the cow has n't given a drop of milk in weeks .
JACK: But that 's cheating .
JACK'S MOTHER: We 're starving , Jack . Do n't you understand that ? You 're not to take less than five pounds for her . Are you listening to me ?
HE'S NOT: Yes .
JACK'S MOTHER: How much are you to ask ?

GUS: I nailed his ass .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Trains
MARYLIN: I thought he 'd outgrown trains . Gus Petch sits behind a desk .
GUS: They never grow-up , lady . They just get tubby . Me , I 've always had ample proportions . But it 's all muscle I 'm hard as a rock . I 'm not on of these cream puff sit-behind-a desk private dicks ; I 'm an assnaile
MARYLIN: So I see . Faintly , from the monitor
VOICE: I 'm gon na nail your ass .
MARYLIN: Hard to believe that 's the best he could do .
GUS: Probably you 're the best he could do .
MARYLIN: Oh . Thank you .
GUS: You 're takin ' it pretty well . I seen 'em weep like they 'd hired me to prove their husbands were n't fooling around . And I seen 'em celebrate . Like I just handed 'em a winning lottery ticket .
MARYLIN: I 'm just enjoying the movie .
MILES: hello Marjory , any messages ? Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah . Have Wrigley look up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its elevance to the Chapman filing . She took the kids where ? Tahoe ? Which side of Tahoe . Great . If the cruise goes all the way around the lake , she left the state and she 's in each . She ca n't leave the state . Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to attach everything . Primary residence , autos , stocks Sure . Put him through . Hello Ross . What ? She 's sleeping with the nanny ? Well , you 're separated . She can sleep with is this the one you slept with ? Oh . A guy ? Interesting career choice . Hmmm ? Yes . I know you want her dead . Everyone in your tax bracket wants their ex wives dead .

MARYLIN: Rex . Get away from the door .
REX: Look , Marylin , ca n't we have a civilized discussion about this ?
MARYLIN: We are . And it 's winding down .
REX: But Marylin , you know a divorce would uin me right now . Everything I have everything we have is tied up in my business . The business is my entire life .
MARYLIN: Are you forgetting about the Atcheson , Topeka and the Santa Fe ?
REX: Marylin ?
MARYLIN: Rex . Go away . I do n't want to have to sic the dogs on you .
REX: Dogs ?
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Massey will be right with you .
MILES: The problem is that everyone is willing to compromise . That 's the problem with the institution of marriage it 's based on compromise . Even through its dissolution . One attorney will try to score some points , the opposition will try to impeach . The process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers , and then each party will walk away with their portion of the `` goodies . '' Some say , `` Life is compromise . '' But at Massey Myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent .
RECEPTIONIST: Your eleven o'clock is here .
MILES: Ladies and Gentlemen we will continue this at the Associates Meeting next Friday . In the meantime , I want you to consider this Ivan the Terrible , Henry the VIII , Attila the Hun what did they have in common ? As he exits .

MILES: That 's her job . You have to respect that .
REX: When I first met Marylin Well , we were crazy about each other . Not emotionally , of course . We just could n't keep our hands off each other .
MILES: Mm .
REX: But then But then Quietly .
MILES: Time marches on . Ardor cools .
REX: No . Not exactly . It did n't exactly cool . Marylin is a knock-out . And very sexy but there 's a lot of it out there .
MILES: Ah .
REX: You know what I mean when I say `` it . ''
MILES: Gotcha . No need to get anatomically correct with me , Rex .
REX: Seems like there 's more of it than ever before
MILES: Well , with the expanding global population Let me ask you this your wife . Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the `` knock-out , sexy woman '' you described ?
REX: I do n't know . I can assume
MILES: Not in court you ca n't . Has she etained counsel ?
REX: I 'm not sure .
MILES: And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities ?
REX: Video .
MILES: Mmm And to cut to the chase , forensically speaking is there a pre-nup ? Rex hangs his head . Miles sighs sympathetically .
REX: That 's the problem . I ca n't afford to give her anything .
MILES: Nothing ?
REX: I know that sounds rough but I 'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls , and I 'm mortgaged up to my ass . If this deal goes south , I 'm ruined I 'll lose millions .
MILES: So , you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part , your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear ?
REX: Well is that possible ? Miles smiles at him .
SARAH: You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow ?

MARYLIN: Miles Massey .

WOMAN: No , he had the videos

RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Massey will see you now .
MILES: Ruth ! They shake hands .
MARYLIN: And you must be Mr. Massey .
REX: Marylin .
MARYLIN: Are you alright ? You lost weight .
REX: My whole metabolism is off .
MILES: So , Ruth . How 's Sam ?
RUTH: Sam is Sam . He 's taking up fly fishing . He 's in a yert in Montana .
MILES: A yert . Ruth is a living legend , Rex . At a time when most women are in Boca , having early bird specials she 's working so her husband can be in Montana . In a yert .
REX: What 's a yert ?
RUTH: I ran into your mother at the adiologist last week .
MILES: What ? !
RUTH: Oh , just a routine mammogram . She said to say hello . She 's going to Positano with your brother 's family . A tight , terse smile from Miles .
MILES: How nice .
MARYLIN: Positano is beautiful . Remember when we were there , Rex ? We stayed in the Santo Pietro ? That hotel on the cliff ?
REX: Yeah . They drift for a moment .
RUTH: So , Miles . If you have a proposal , let 's hear it .
MILES: At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation .
RUTH: My client has ruled that out .
MILES: My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice .
RUTH: That 's delusional .
MILES: My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period .
RUTH: My client feels sufficiently dispassionate .
MILES: My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order .
RUTH: Ha Ha .
MILES: Heh heh .
REX: What 's so goddamn funny ? Miles lays a hand on his arm .
MILES: Please let me handle this .
RUTH: My client is prepared to settle fo fifty percent of the marital assets .
MILES: Why only fifty percent , Ruth ? Why not ask for a hundred percent ?
RUTH: Oh brother . Here we go .
MILES: Why not a hundred and fifty percent ?
RUTH: Yes . Maybe you 're right , Miles . Maybe we 're being too conservative . Seventy five percent .
MARYLIN: Do you need a Tagamet ?
REX: You have some ?
MARYLIN: These are yours .
MILES: Not according to Mrs. Rabinow .
MARYLIN: Have you been taking your digestive enzymes ?
REX: Sometimes I forget .
MARYLIN: I 'm sorry . Where were we ?
RUTH: We were about to request the primary esidence , and thirty percent of the emaining assets .
MILES: Are you familiar with Kirshner ?
RUTH: Kirshner does not apply . Kirshne was in Kentucky .

RUTH: See you at the preliminary . Miles calls to Ruth 's retreating back .
MILES: Fine . We 'll eat all the pastry .
REX: She always looked out for me .
MILES: And she had private investigators assisting her .
REX: She brought my digestive enzymes .
MILES: In anticipation of making you sick .
REX: Maybe I should reconsider my Miles looks at him . Shakes his head , sadly .
MILES: A superficial display of marital solicitude , and you lose your resolve ? Rex . I underestimated you . But I 'm your attorney , and if you choose to eward her for that mediocre charade of spousal concern He shrugs , helplessly .
REX: You 're right . Screw her .
MARYLIN: I do n't know what his game is . He dismissed every one of Ruth 's proposals . And Sarah , we were n't unreasonable .
SARAH: Well what does he want ?
MARYLIN: I do n't know . Ruth kept her cool , ut I could tell she was surprised .
SARAH: He has a reputation for being tough .
MARYLIN: Lilly 's up .
SARAH: Oh , God !
MARYLIN: Every week
SARAH: I 'm dying .
MARYLIN: Anyway , even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence . If I did n't know etter , I 'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination .
SARAH: So where are you now ?
MARYLIN: Well , if he continues to maintain this position we 're in court .
SARAH: Shit .
MARYLIN: Get this ! He called and invited me to dinner .
INSTRUCTOR: Marylin ? Ready .
MARYLIN: Huh ? Oh , yeah . Sure .
SARAH: That 's completely odd .
MARYLIN: I know . That 's why I accepted . Find out what 's up with this clown .
INSTRUCTOR: That was excellent , Marylin . But you forgot to yell `` no . ''
MARYLIN: Ah . No .
MILES: Mrs. Rexroth . Thank you for coming . The Maitre d ' is pulling out a chair for her .
MARYLIN: I have to admit . I was curious . And hungry .
MAITRE D': Something to start ? Some wine , perhaps ? Miles glances at the wine list .
MILES: French ? Bordeaux ? Hmmm . Chateau Margaux '57 .
MARYLIN: I assume this is on Rex ?
MILES: Is n't everything ? Miles regards her .
MARYLIN: `` Dismiss your vows , your feigned tears , your flattery , for where a heart is hard , they make no battery . ''
MILES: Simon & Garfunkel ? She laughs .
MARYLIN: Did you see the tape ?
MILES: Not yet .
MARYLIN: See the tape . Then we can discuss my heart .
MILES: What does your lawyer think ?
MARYLIN: Ruth says you 've been too successful , that you 're bored , complacent , and you 're on your way down .
MILES: But you do n't agree ?
MARYLIN: How do you know ?
MILES: Why would you be here ?
MARYLIN: I told you . I was hungry .
MILES: I 'll have the tournedos of beef . And the lady will have the same ? I assume you 're a carnivore .
MARYLIN: I know you do . She addresses the waiter .
MILES: `` Who ever lov 'd that lov 'd not at first sight ? ''
MARYLIN: You did n't ask me here to pick me up . You could get in trouble fo that .
MILES: Not really . You 're not my client . Freedom of association . Big issue with the First Amendment fans . Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend ?
MARYLIN: Have you ever been married , Miles ?
MILES: No .
MARYLIN: You do n't believe in it .
MILES: As a matter of fact , I 'm a huge fan .
MARYLIN: You just have n't met the right person .
MILES: No . I have n't . Have you ? She regards him for a moment .
MARYLIN: All right , Miles . Let me tell you everything you THINK you know . I was married to Rex for a long time . I was an excellent wife , a partner , a lover , a hostess and a friend . There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together . I got five years older . Think he should e able to ditch me for that ?
MILES: He wants a reconciliation .
MARYLIN: See the tape . Then we can discuss econciliation . Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass . Now I 'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it . Then I 'm getting on with my life . That 's all I 'm after .
MILES: Gotcha .
MARYLIN: What is it you 're after , Miles ?
MILES: Oh , I 'm a lot like you just looking for an ass to mount .

MILES: Shut ! Up !
VOICE: I 'm gon na nail your ass .
MARYLIN: I was devastated . Of course .
RUTH: Thank you , Mrs. Rexroth .
JUDGE: Mr. Massey , any questions ? Miles soberly rises .
MILES: Mmmm
RUTH: Objection , your honor !
JUDGE: Grounds ?
RUTH: Uh poetry recitation .
MILES: Let me rephrase . Mrs. Rexroth , how high is that wall around your heart ? Marylin eyes him suspiciously .
RUTH: Your honor , this is harassment ! Arid frankly it 's still a little She flutters one hand .
MILES: Rephrase . Mrs. Rexroth , have you ever been in love ?
MARYLIN: Yes . I loved my husband , Rex .
MILES: And you 've always loved him ? Smiles slips out
MARYLIN: `` Who ever lov 'd that lov 'd not at first sight ? '' Miles returns a fleeting smile .
MILES: And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him ?
MARYLIN: Yes . Why is that so difficult fo you to understand ? She looks at Rex with tender sorrow .
MILES: That 'll be all Mrs. Rexroth . Please forgive me for causing you additional anguish . Thank you , Your Honor . No furthe questions .
JUDGE: Who 's next , Mrs. Rabinow .
RUTH: We rest , Your Honor .
JUDGE: Mr. Massey ?
MILES: Yes , Your honor . I call Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg .
BAILIFF: Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg .
RUTH: Who 's that ?
MARYLIN: Jesus .
BAILIFF: Mrs. Isenberg .
PATRICIA: Banderas .
BAILIFF: Mrs. Banderas , do you solemnly swea that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth so help you God ?
PATRICIA: Yes , Mr. Bailiff . I do .
MILES: Now , Mrs. Banderas . What is you elationship to Mrs. Rexroth .
PATRICIA: We do n't have much of a relationship anymore . I have n't seen her since efore she married Rex . We had some very nice times prior to that . We were quite close .
RUTH: Is this a lover ?
MARYLIN: Please !
MILES: And how would you define you elationship to Mrs. Rexroth . You know you are her ?
PATRICIA: Mother ?
RUTH: What ? ! Marylin sighs .
MILES: Her Mother ?
PATRICIA: Hi , Sweetie .
MILES: Hard to believe I know . I 'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters .
MARYLIN: He 'll regret this .
MILES: Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth ?
PATRICIA: No . I have n't . But I 've been out of town . Hello , Rex . Hello there .
MILES: You were never invited to meet you son-in-law ?
PATRICIA: No . Uh uh . I do n't think so . Hmm ? No . Well no .
RUTH: Objection , Your Honor . This is n't about Mrs. Rexroth 's filial obligations .
JUDGE: Sustained .
MILES: Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married ?
PATRICIA: Of course . Of course she was married . What else would she be ? Single ? I do n't think so .
MILES: Who 's `` Patty . ''
PATRICIA: Oh . That 's her name . Patricia . Like mine . I was Pat and she was Patty . But she changed it after seeing `` Some Like It Hot . '' To Marylin . Afte Marylin Monroe .
MILES: I see . And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin ?
PATRICIA: When she was a tiny girl ? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up ? She never said the usual things little girls say like nurse ballerina anchorwoman ? She always said `` When I grow up , I want to be divorced . '' She laughs happily at the memory .
MILES: Divorce was her childhood aspiration ?
PATRICIA: Well , not just divorce . She used to say `` I want to be divorced from some ig dumb rich guy '' And I guess her dream is coming true . I 'm happy for you Patty
MARYLIN: It was like that scene in The Godfather . Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family . And he 's in court , and he looks into the spectators gallery , and sees his Brother . They brought the brothe from Sicily . And Frankie ca n't say a word . He ca n't testify . That 's what it was like seeing Pat in there . I could n't even have Ruth cross examine her .
RAMONA: Why do you think she did it ?
MARYLIN: Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA . Maybe they offered her money . Massey is very seductive . Who knows .
RAMONA: Maybe they put a horse head in he ed ?
SARAH: That stinks . They left you with absolutely nothing . It makes you wonder about the entire legal system . Like Rodney King .
MARYLIN: They bought her speech . If I was only in it for Rex 's money , he should n't have to give me any .
RAMONA: That does n't make sense . It 's like punishing you for being goal oriented .
SARAH: Well , you can live here as long as you want . Do you have any plans ?
MARYLIN: Nothing specific , but I 'll have my own place soon .
SARAH: So , Marylin . Is that what you said when you were a little girl ?
MARYLIN: Probably . Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice . What was I supposed to say . Anthropologist ?
RAMONA: I begged you to have a baby !
MARYLIN: In the Godfather , after the courtroom scene , Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub .
SARAH: You 're not
MARYLIN: No . I 'll see some blood before this is over , but it wo n't be mine .
MILES: She got absolutely nothing . Zero . Zip .
KENNETH: So . I wo n't be seeing her ? You clients usually visit me after the settlement .
MILES: Not this one . Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery , which , incidentally , she does not need .
KENNETH: Everyone needs plastic surgery . You need it .
MILES: I do n't need it .
KENNETH: You want Botox ?
MILES: What the hell is Botox ?
KENNETH: It 's a form of botulism . I just inject it into your forehead , and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you ca n't aise them
MILES: Why in God 's name would I want ?
KENNETH: No frown lines . New watch ?
MILES: It 's a LeCoultre Revers . You can flip the face , and set it for two time zones .
KENNETH: Why would you need two time zones ? You never leave Beverly Hills .
MILES: It was a gift from a client .
KENNETH: Set one side for Bel Air .
MILES: Botox . Christ . We had aspirations when we were in college .
KENNETH: We did not .
MILES: You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon . I was going to clerk fo the Supreme Court .
KENNETH: I was going to play golf . You were going to have Asian girlfriends .
MILES: Denial is not a river in Egypt . Kenneth moves a chess piece .
KENNETH: You 're in check .
MILES: I should be in therapy .
BONNIE: Well , I would n't say
MILES: Your husband , who has beaten you epeatedly
BONNIE: He
MILES: Please was at the time brandishing your firearm , trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance friend of long standing
BONNIE: They hate each other
MILES: So he says now ! But if not for you cool headed intervention , his tantrum might have ended this schmoe 's life and ruined his own As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place , was n't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man ?
VOICE: Mr. Massey , Mr. Meyerson would like to see you when you have a moment . Miles is surprised .
MILES: Herb wants to see me ?
VOICE: When you have a moment .
MILES: Thank you Herb .
VOICE: Mr. Massey
MILES: Please ! No calls ! I 'm feeling very fragile .
VOICE: I 'm sorry , Mr. Massey , but I felt certain you 'd want to know Marylin Rexroth wants to see you .
MILES: Marylin Rexroth ? When does she
VOICE: She 's here now .
MILES: Marylin ! How nice .
MILES: Marylin , what a pleas who the fuck are you ?
MARYLIN: Miles , how nice of you to see us may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil .
DOYLE: I told you we know each other , baby . Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law . Martin Reiser ?
MILES: Oh . Right . Wo n't you have a seat ?
DOYLE: After you , Doll .
MILES: And how is Mrs. Reiser ?
DOYLE: Few suicide attempts , little inpatient stint . Naturally , she misses he kids . Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but hey all 's fair . Anyhoo , she lives with a `` nurse , '' takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop .
MILES: So she 's uh , flourishing ?
DOYLE: She makes felt wallets . Got one right here .
MARYLIN: Miles , I know you 're busy and that you charge by the hour so I 'll come to the point . Howard and I are planning to marry . Miles is stunned .
MILES: Muh Well , uh Huh ?
DOYLE: Yep . My divorce just came through . Shoulda called you . Coulda cut a etter deal ! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children . But , I do n't know . Guess I 'm just a softie . After all Amanda and me were together for what you 'd know better than me , Marylin . She was your best friend .
MARYLIN: Sixteen years ? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what twelve ?
DOYLE: Here . Got pictures .
MILES: I uh guess congratulations are in order .
DOYLE: Well Marylin and Rex broke up and
MARYLIN: Honey , I do n't think this is really elevant to
DOYLE: and one day , this sweet girl calls me , asks me to lunch . Just a shoulde to cry on deal . One thing leads to another and before I know it
MARYLIN: we realized we 'd always been very attracted to one another .
MILES: No !
DOYLE: I had no idea until after , but He looks at her with predatory lust .
MARYLIN: Howard !
MILES: What a touching story .
DOYLE: You know , Miles , after my wife wife 's mastectomy things were never the same . This might sound cold , well , maybe not to you , Massey , ut I like my women with two boobs .
MARYLIN: Howard and I are here , Miles , because I have learned through bitte experience that when it comes to matrimonial law , you are the very est . Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod .
DOYLE: You did good , Massey !
MARYLIN: Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement .
DOYLE: And there 's no talking her out of it . Believe me , I 've tried .
MARYLIN: They say the Massey pre-nup has neve een penetrated .
DOYLE: She said `` penetrate . '' Heh heh heh . He gropes her . She giggles like a teenager .
MILES: Oh , for the love of
MARYLIN: That is true , is n't it Miles ? You pre-nup is the best there is ?
MILES: That is correct . Not to blow my own horn , but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law .
DOYLE: Harvard ? Whoa , Daddy !
MILES: I just want to make sure that you oth He eyes Marylin .
DOYLE: Well at the moment , that 'd be me .
MILES: And without it , that party is exposed a sitting duck . No wriggle room .
DOYLE: A Wriggle Room ! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house . Screw the screening room !
MILES: and we are sure Eyes boring into Marylin .
MARYLIN: Absolutely .
DOYLE: Course I ca n't do much `` wriggling '' if you tie me up like that again . Massey this is one bad bad little girl .
MARYLIN: We 'd better go before we get thrown out .
MILES: Excuse me , Mr. Doyle , if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment .
DOYLE: What part ?
MILES: I 'd just like to have a word with her .
DOYLE: Why not ? I 'm going to have her for a lifetime .
MILES: What are you doing ?
MARYLIN: Getting married .
MILES: To him ? He 's a sick freak .
MARYLIN: He 's passionate .
MILES: Passionate ! He 's a pervert . He should have to register when he moves .
MARYLIN: All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time .
MILES: Marylin ! Listen to me .
MARYLIN: No . You listen to me . You busted me , Miles . You left me with nothing ! What did you expect me to do ? Get a degree in counseling ? Write a book about table linen ? Because that 's what wives do when they get dumped , and frankly , I 'm not quite ready for that .
MILES: But why him ?
MARYLIN: We told you . We realized we 've always een in love .
MILES: The Massey pre-nup has never been pene successfully challenged .
MARYLIN: So I hear . Is that all ?
MILES: No , that 's not all . He moves to kiss her .
KENNETH: Got any symptoms ?
MILES: Yes . The inability to experience pleasure .
KENNETH: Oh . That . Do n't waste time with your queen .
MILES: What ?
KENNETH: The Center Counter Defense . The thing is not to move your queen too early .
MILES: She ca n't really love that idiot , can she ?
KENNETH: What ?
MILES: Marylin Rexroth . She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle .
KENNETH: Doyle Oil ? A Massey Pre-nup ? She loves him .
MILES: He 's the wrong man .
KENNETH: Miles ! Do n't waste time with someone else 's queen , either .
BOLENSKY: Parsley sage , rosemary and thyme Remember me to one who lives there
MILES: What the hell is wrong with you ?
WRIGLEY: I ca n't help it . Even with the usiness we 're in , I it gets me every time . It 's so optimistic .
MILES: Is she going through with it ?
WRIGLEY: If she 's not going through with it , she 's cutting it awful close .
RABBI BOLENSKY: Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme . Ingredients . Spices . Spicy ingredients for the banquet we call life . Marriage is like a Great Feast . Courtship is the Appetizer . A small mixed green taste of things to come . The Early Years The First Course a carefully poached fish dish dependent on freshness and delicate handling . Or perhaps a light pasta a tortellini stuffed with cheese and hope .
WRIGLEY: You have any gum or mints ?
RABBI: The main course Mature Love a hearty stew , cooked slowly in the oven of companionship until the meat falls off the bone . And then dessert . The reward for years spent together the sweetness of a Life Well Lived . A sorbet of grandchildren , followed by the decafe demitasse of etirement .
RABBI BOLENKSY: Do you Chaim David Doyle , take Marylin to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang though the lean years as well as those that are heavily marbled ?
DOYLE: I do .
RABBI BOLENSKY: And do you , Marylin Rexroth , take Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel ? The stock in your sauce ?
MARYLIN: I do .
MILES: Argh .
RABBI BOLENSKY: Then , by the power vested in me by the state of California , and as the maitre 'd in the Prix Fixe Four Sta Restaurant of Life , I now pronounce you man and wife A kiss . Cheers . Applause .
WRIGLEY: What do you think ?
MILES: What are they ?
WRIGLEY: Berry spoons .
MILES: Spoons ! Honestly Wrigley , I 'm surprised at you . What is this ? Some Martha Stewart suggestion ? Those are the most cockamamie things I 've ever
WRIGLEY: Miles why so angry ? Miles sounds wistful
MILES: Why could n't we be the club sandwich ?
DOYLE: Ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls I have something to say to my bride .
MILES: Brilliant . Next to him Wrigley is puzzled .
WRIGLEY: Why is he doing that ? Miles ' hand-clapping accelerates .
MILES: Brilliant . It 's brilliant . He 's eating the pre-nup .
DOYLE: This is for you , Darling ! Wrigley bursts into tears .
WRIGLEY: That 's the most romantic thing I 've ever seen in my LIFE !
MILES: I 'd like to offer my congratulations . That was a beautiful gesture of Howard 's .
MARYLIN: Howard is a beautiful person .
MILES: Yes . He 's a diamond in the rough . And I have a feeling that someday soon you 'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough .
MARYLIN: Miles . Miles . Miles .
MILES: I am thrilled for you , but tell me this How 'd you get Howard to do it ? I 've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion , ut it seemed like he thought it was his own idea .
MARYLIN: It was his idea . It was a gesture of love and trust . Be happy for me , Miles .
MILES: Well , when this goes south promise you 'll have dinner with me ?
MARYLIN: Have you tried the duck ?
MILES: I figure a couple of months . That 's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry . He takes the plate of food from her .
MARYLIN: It has bones . Be sure to swallow one .
MILES: Although knowing you as I do there will be no settlement . This time it will be complete and total annihilation . With a ROAR we CUT TO

MILES: And of course we shall have to litigate . Sentence . Paragraph .
MILES: Naturally the first concern fo oth parties is the welfare of little Wendell junior . Nevertheless , we question whether the continuing expenses for his special ed classes are truly justified given the great strides Wrigley enters .
WRIGLEY: I 'm sorry I 'm late . I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow 's assistant . Guess what ? Marylin Rexroth is divorced !

MILES: No , we 're not !
MARYLIN: We are , Miles . You know I 'm right . There 's something `` off '' about you and me Miles . And maybe it is n't ecause of these women maybe they were just extremely insightful and ecognized our `` deficiencies '' very early on . Maybe
MILES: That is bullshit ! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho . I ca n't believe you 're saying this , Marylin ! There 's nothing wrong with us . We 're attractive and charismatic and successful and I like us .

RAMONA: You 're vulnerable .
MARYLIN: It 's about time .

MILES: The decision of course , is each of ours . For my part , I have made the leap of love , and there is no going ack
MARYLIN: I 'm sorry . I 'm squishing you . I 'll move to the

MARYLIN: Honey , I could sit
MILES: In fact , this is not a married house it 's a bachelor pad .
MARYLIN: Hardly . You have six bedrooms
MILES: I know . But I 've converted most of them into ridiculous `` Guy '' rooms a billiard room , a card room , a gym Honey , want you to go out , as soon as you feel up to it and buy married things . Woman things . Personalize it . Marylinize it . Make this your house . He hands her a credit card .
MARYLIN: Well , I suppose I could `` girly '' it up for you with a little Fortuny , and some passementerie
MILES: Good . Are those foods ?
MARYLIN: Fabric and fringe .
MILES: Exactly . And then maybe not ight away There 's a room right off the bedroom It would be perfect for a nursery . It 's a walk in humidor right now ut if I took out the refrigeration unit
MARYLIN: Miles .
MILES: I think a nursery should be right off the master suite . My parents put mine in the guest house . Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom , ut my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so She stops him with a kiss .
RAMONA: You said 'yes ' did n't you ?
MARYLIN: I said yes . She picks up an antique Chinese bowl .

SARAH: But you 're going through with it ?
MARYLIN: Yes , yes , it 's just you know I 've never been the first wife . Rex was married before me .
SARAH: So what ?
MARYLIN: Miles is different . He 's still so idealistic .
SARAH: Well , that 's about to change big time .
MARYLIN: He has no cynicism or anger . Fo once I 'm not the repository of rage at some other woman .
SARAH: Soon , you 'll have your own rage !
MARYLIN: I guess .
WOMAN: Wait . I know you .
MILES: Yes ?
WOMAN: You 're Miles Massey ! You probably do n't recognize me . The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair .

WOMAN: He tricked you . With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup . Howard Doyle . He got you . You married Marylin , did n't you ? You thought she had money . HA HA HA . Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me . And to Marylin Rexroth . Yeah . I heard all about it . My brother Howard Doyle got you . Neener neener neener .
MILES: He divorced his wife he married Marylin he divorced Marylin and he remarried his WIFE ? What kind of sick
RUTH: Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle . They do n't like the way you operate . They helped her .
MILES: He never ate the pre-nup , did he !
RUTH: I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats . I 'm not a damn dietician .
MILES: Did Marylin end up with money ?
RUTH: She 's YOUR wife . Why do n't you ask her ? Anyway , I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup .
MILES: I do n't have a pre-nup
RUTH: The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars
MILES: Do n't give me that crap . That 's MY crap .
RUTH: And it 's good !
MILES: I 'll have you suspended . I 'll have you disbarred .
RUTH: Do n't threaten me , Miles . I did nothing illegal .
MILES: why did she do it , Ruth ? Why ?
RUTH: That 's attorney client privilege . Sorry , Miles . But as a great and clever man once said , What 's good for the goose
MARYLIN: Hi .
MILES: Hello Marylin .
MARYLIN: I have a surprise for you .
MILES: I bet .
MARYLIN: Ta Da . Miles looks at it , expressionless .

MILES: Can you Marylin ? Can you return the trust ? Can you return the hopes ? The dreams ? Can you just
MARYLIN: Miles ? You 're scaring me .
MILES: I 'm sorry , Darling . I love it . It 's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and . It 's you , Marylin . It is YOU .
MARYLIN: But Ruth things have changed yes yes I understand . But you see I could n't file , did I ? And maybe I was n't going to file . Maybe maybe Ruth Yes . Okay .
PROSECUTOR: How far would this gun have to be in order to inflict a wound without leaving powder burns on the scalp .
EXPERT WITNESS: Approximately three feet .
PROSECUTOR: And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot herself in the back of the head from a distance of three feet ?
KENNETH: Really long arms ? He moves a piece .
MILES: They wo n't get a conviction . The husband called it in as a suicide . The forensic guys were n't thinking murder . I 'm sure some of the evidence was compromised .
KENNETH: It 's your move , Miles .
MILES: I already made my move , Kenneth .
SARAH: Vishu ! Knock it off . That hurts .
VISHNU: Breathe through it .
MARYLIN: I do n't even know where he is . He looked so devastated . If I could just talk to him for a few minutes .
MARYLIN: Was that the bell ?
RAMONA: It sounded like a bell .
MARYLIN: I 'll be right back .
POLICE OFFICER: Marylin Hamilton Rexroth Doyle Massey ?
MARYLIN: Yes .
POLICE OFFICER: We have a warrant for your arrest .
MARYLIN: What ?
POLICE OFFICER: You can go now , Mrs. Massey . Someone made bail . Marylin exits .
MARYLIN: Forgery and Fraud ?
RUTH: You used his credit card .
MARYLIN: He told me to he said he wanted me to
RUTH: Quite a little shopping spree . How do you spend six figures in less than six hours ? Oh , never mind I 've seen it before . I 've seen everything .
MARYLIN: Do you think he set me up ? Do you think that was his intention ?
RUTH: Like I know his intention ? Or yours for that matter ? I should join Sam . I 'm too old fo this bullshit .
MARYLIN: He never even asked . He just assumed
RUTH: He was right , was n't he ?
MARYLIN: So . Now what ?
RUTH: Now ? Well , Marylin , now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her .
MILES: Well . Well . Well . Look who made bail !
MARYLIN: May I come in ?
MILES: I do n't know . Maybe I should grab my mace . I 'm a civil attorney . I have little experience with `` the criminal mind . ''
MARYLIN: I 'd just like to pick up a few of my things
MILES: I do n't believe you have `` things . ''
MARYLIN: On the contrary . We 're married and we have no pre-nup , so a case could e made that everything in here is mine .
MILES: What do you want ?
MARYLIN: I want to nail you ass .
MILES: Are you threatening me , because I 'm sure that 's a violation of the terms of your bail .
MARYLIN: I 'm reporting you to the IRS .
MILES: The IRS ? They owe me . I 'm expecting a refund . He laughs . She looks at him , dead serious .
MARYLIN: I 'm not talking about dollars , studmuffin . I 'm talking about She opens a humidor and takes out a Cigar .

MILES: Those are gifts .
MARYLIN: Salary . Unreported income . By the way , what time IS it on Bellagio Road ?
MILES: You ca n't prove anything .
MARYLIN: I do n't have to . That 's what the IRS guys do . And they do it with great zeal . See , they work at these tortuous civil service jobs , and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies , these saps feel.. well , they feel like saps . And they feel itter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH . What is this ? A Romeo and Julieta ?
MILES: You 're out of your league , Marylin . Rexroth was a primate . I 'm a professional .
MARYLIN: I know . So am I , right ? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service . He 's a dedicated , underpaid graduate of Southwestern University very tenacious , and never more so than when he 's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague . I think it 's only fair to warn you I 'm going to file an action , Miles . And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house .
MILES: Meaning my house .
MARYLIN: I believe the residence will be part of the settlement .
MILES: Did our marriage ever mean anything to you ?
MARYLIN: Drop the bogus forgery charge and I 'll forget about your generous friends slash clients .
MILES: That 's blackmail .
MARYLIN: That 's marriage .
MILES: Pity you ca n't be here . You 'd enjoy this .
HERB: This woman has humbled , shamed and disgrazed the entire foim .
MILES: Yes Herb ,
HERB: Counseluh , this foim deals in powuh . This foim deals in p'seption . This foim can not prospuh nor long endowwa . if it is p'seeved as dancin ' to the music..

VICTOR: Jeez Louise ! How 'd you do that ?
DOUG: Intestinal gas produced by acterial metabolism of food esidues in the colon . A mixture of oxygen , hydrogen , carbon dioxide , and methane . That 's the secret ingredient .
VICTOR: What 's so secret about it ?
DOUG: Not everyone can produce methane . It 's genetic , that means it 's inherited . There 's a lot of methane in my family .
VICTOR: You 're full of shit .
DOUG: Look it up , it 's all in the encyclopedia .
VICTOR: They do n't got farts in the encyclopedia .
DOUG: Hey , they got 'vagina ' in the dictionary , they got farts in the encyclopedia .
VICTOR: Vagina is in the dictionary ?
DOUG: ' A canal leading from the uterus to the vulva ' .
VICTOR: You sure read a lot , man . A canal ?
DOUG: It 's Jacey that 's him skiing . He must 've skipped out on work .
SANDY: No way ! He 's never done the ramp .
STEVE: He wants to do it .
ELEANOR: You know you 're going too fast ?
STEVE: Yeah , I know .
DOUG: Time to eat .
JACEY: Do n't tell Mom .
DOUG: Oh , shit
JACEY: Just do n't tell Mom . All right ?
DOUG: Yeah , okay , all right . Jacey walks out of the bathroom .
ELEANOR: Congratulations .
JACEY: For what ?
ELEANOR: I heard you got accepted to Penn .
JACEY: Oh . Yeah . Thanks .
ELEANOR: How 'd you swing an Ivy League school like that ?
JACEY: My grandfather went there . I had the grades , so
ELEANOR: It stinks in here .
JACEY: I dropped something .
ELEANOR: Yeah , me .
JACEY: I just thought you and Steve
ELEANOR: Well , that 's what you thought . I think Steve is I do n't even know what I think about Steve , I never think about him . I just do things . And let other people figure them out . That 's what parents are for . They 're real good at doing all the thinking . Why should I ? Alice is going to have a baby . She and Kilroy did n't waste any time . He 's already talking about having another , and Alice is up- chucking every hour on the hour . She 's got morning-noon-and-night sickness . I 've got the feeling she 'll be barefoot and puking fo years to come . Wallpaper patterns that 's all she talks about . She and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern ooks . That 's another thing I never think about wallpaper . Well , I think this is called the silent treatment . I get enough of that from my father , I do n't need it from you . Good luck at Penn .
PAMELA: Come on , Eleanor Dad 's waiting .
LLOYD: Stay away from him .
ELEANOR: Who ?
LLOYD: Jacey .
ELEANOR: Why ?
LLOYD: Because I said so .
VICTOR: We should have a party out at the oathouse , man . That 's what we should do .
DOUG: Sure .
VICTOR: You know , invite some girls .
DOUG: Right .
VICTOR: Get some beer , go swimming . Look up a few words in the dictionary .
DOUG: Yeah , like 'boring ' or 'eunuch . '
VICTOR: Eunuch ? What 's that ?
DOUG: It 's Latin for bus boy .
WEBB: Business is a little light today , too damn hot . Which one of you knuckle-heads wants to get off early ?
ELEANOR: Hi , Doug .
JACEY: Get out ! ! !
HELEN: Oh , we forgot an umbrella .
JACEY: I 'll buy a new one in Philadelphia .
HELEN: And do n't forget your sport coat .
JACEY: Yeah , I 'll go pick it up .
HELEN: Take Doug with you .
JACEY: I 'm just going to the cleaners .
HELEN: Take him along for the ride . Go have a root beer at the Dog ' n'Suds .
JACEY: I got ta finish packing .
HELEN: I 'll finish up . Doug 's going to miss you .
JACEY: Baloney .
HELEN: I think he will .

HELEN: Oh , dammit , Jacey , please take your brother with you .
JACEY: Yes , ma'am .
DOUG: Okay .

DOUG: Root beer ?
JACEY: No , a beer .
DOUG: A beer beer ?
JACEY: Yeah .
DOUG: Where are we gon na get beer ?
JACEY: The bait shop . If you go in alone and nobody else is in the store , Ernie 'll sell you a couple of ottles .
DOUG: Remember that time I got my dick caught in my zipper ? Jacey gives Doug a quizzical look .
JACEY: Yeah , I remember .
JACEY: We should own that company .
DOUG: What do you mean ?
JACEY: Midwest Steel Desk . Dad 's file cabinet drawer . Lloyd Abbott screwed mom out of Dad 's patent after he died .
DOUG: Says who ?
JACEY: It 's true .
DOUG: Mom 's not stupid .
JACEY: I did n't say she was stupid . Lloyd 's pretty smooth . That 's why he owns the company .
DOUG: He owns the company 'cause he married the boss 's daughter .
JACEY: He owns the company 'cause that patent saved the company 's ass after the war , when all the wa contracts dried up .
DOUG: Well , maybe Mom sold it 'cause we needed the money .
JACEY: What money ? We never had any money . Money had nothing to do with it .
DOUG: Then why did she sell the patent ?
JACEY: She just did , that 's all that matters . And that 's why we 're driving this car and not that one .
DOUG: Yeah .
PAMELA: How 's your chin ?
DOUG: Drop dead .
PAMELA: You want a ride ?

DOUG: What are you doing tonight ? You want to go out ?
PAMELA: I do n't believe you . You 're crazy . I 'm baby-sitting . My folks went out to dinner with Peter and Alice and I got tricked into watching the baby .
DOUG: Oh . Where 's Eleanor ?
PAMELA: I thought you came over to ask me out ?
DOUG: I did .
PAMELA: Good , 'cause Eleanor is n't here .
DOUG: Can I come in ?

PAMELA: You know handsome , sexy , sophisticated . Pipe-smokers .
DOUG: Oh . I do n't think Jacey smokes a pipe .
PAMELA: Well , you do n't have to smoke a pipe to be trig .
DOUG: Oh .
PAMELA: You think I 'm different than Eleanor ?
DOUG: Sure .
PAMELA: Like how ?
DOUG: Like you 're smarter .
PAMELA: Yeah , real smart , that 's why I 'm aby-sitting and she 's out having fun . Eleanor 's smart .
DOUG: So how come she flunked biology ?
PAMELA: Well , you 're no Albert Einstein .
DOUG: I got a three-point-two average .
PAMELA: Does n't mean you know my sister .
DOUG: Oh yeah ? You might be surprised .
PAMELA: About what ? What ? What ?
DOUG: Why are we talking about Eleanor ?
PAMELA: I did n't bring her up .
DOUG: Look , either you 're mad at me 'cause you 're mad at me o you 're mad at me 'cause you like me . 'Cause that 's how girls act . I do n't know much , but I know that . So like which is it ?
PAMELA: Both .
PAMELA: Do you love me , Doug ? Do you ?
DOUG: Pam ? Hey Oh , dammit
DOUG: I 'm sorry I 'm really sorry
PAMELA: I 'm not Eleanor I ca n't go so fast .
PAMELA: Get out of here ! Get out !
ALICE: Accidentally brushing your teeth with Brylcreme is a funny story .
PETER: Will you shut up about the fucking Brylcreme !
ALICE: It comes in a red-and-white tube just like a tube of Pepsodent .
PETER: Do you hear me , Alice ? ! Shut up !
PAMELA: The baby 's crying .
LLOYD: Just stay out of it , Joan .
JOAN: Alice meant no harm , I think
LLOYD: It does n't matter what you think , it 's their business . Alice is a spoiled brat , but she 's Peter 's problem now . So just take one of your pills and go watch Jack Paar , see what he 's crying about tonight .
PETER: I 'm warning you , Alice ! Open the damn door ! Alice ? ! Dammit !
DOUG: Oh , shit ! Let me out of here He notices a small window in the stairwell .
ELEANOR: Hi , Doug !
JACEY: Hey , Doug ! Get my suitcase !
DOUG: How do you know when a girl 's eady ?
JACEY: What do you mean , ` ready ' ? Ready for what sex ?
DOUG: Yeah .
JACEY: They 're all ready for sex .
DOUG: They are ?
JACEY: They might not be willing but they 're ready . Just have to make them think you 're the only one around who has what they need .
DOUG: How do you do that ?
JACEY: Find out what 's making them itch and scratch it . If they 're scared , be dependable . If they 're ored , be exciting . If they 're on the rebound , catch them .
DOUG: What if you 're not very dependable or exciting , you know ?
JACEY: Pretend you are .
DOUG: You mean , it 's all just fake ?
JACEY: The sex is real . They pretend they do n't want it . You pretend that you care . Everybody gets what they want .
DOUG: But what if you really feel something for someone ? Really care for them ?
JACEY: I thought you were talking about getting laid ?
DOUG: I guess . I do n't know what I 'm talking about .
JACEY: No shit .
ELEANOR: Come on , come on , come on
LLOYD: What are you doing out here ?
ELEANOR: Fucking Jacey .
LLOYD: Get in the car .
ELEANOR: 'Night .
HELEN: I 'll get it .
HELEN: Hello ?
JOAN: May I have a word with you , Helen ?
HELEN: Of course , come in .
JOAN: No no , I do n't have time thank you .
HELEN: I do n't think that 's necessary .
JOAN: Well , if I were you I would talk to him and tell him
HELEN: No , I 'm sorry , Joan , I will not do that . If you have something to say to my son , then you 'll have to say it to him yourself .
JOAN: I just thought you would like to know what he 's done .
HELEN: And why on earth should I believe anything you say , Joan ?
DOUG: Okay .
HELEN: Is there any sense , you think , in which Jacey has oh , I do n't know , it sounds ridiculous corrupted Eleanor Abbott ? Led he astray ?
DOUG: Well jeez I know that he 's that he 's slept with her . But not because he 's talked about it . I mean Eleanor has lots of oyfriends . I think Jacey likes her more than she likes him .
HELEN: I see . Go finish your homework .
DOUG: I got an incomplete in U.S. History .
PAMELA: How did you manage to do that ?
DOUG: Mrs. Bates caught me drawing boobs on a picture of Mamie Eisenhower .
PAMELA: Why do you do things like that ?
DOUG: I wish I knew . I just ca n't seem to help it sometimes .
PAMELA: Are you coming to the party ? Doug shakes his head no .
DOUG: Happy birthday .
PAMELA: Everybody 's going to be here .
DOUG: I do n't know . Maybe .
PAMELA: Just come , okay ? Please .
DOUG: Fill 'er up .
JACEY: Nice tie .
DOUG: Oh mind if I borrow it ?
JACEY: I thought you did n't like those parties at the Abbott 's ?
DOUG: I do n't .
JACEY: Then why are you going ?
DOUG: Just doing someone a favor . How come you 're not going ?
JACEY: I 'm persona non grata .
DOUG: What 's that mean ?
JACEY: You know what it means .
DOUG: What happened with you and Eleanor ?
JACEY: Nothing . I just outlived my usefulness , that 's all .
DOUG: How were you ` useful ' to her ?
JACEY: Christ , use your imagination . Doug has no reply to that .
DOUG: What do you mean ? Like guys from Fountain Park ?
JACEY: No , I mean me . She was fucking me .
DOUG: We 're not from the wrong side of the tracks .
JACEY: I would n't go to that party if I were you .
DOUG: Well , you 're not me . We 're just as good as the Abbotts .
JACEY: You still do n't know , do you ?
DOUG: Know what ?
DOUG: Know what ?
JACEY: After Dad died Mom had an affair with Lloyd Abbott . That 's how he got Dad 's patent away from her .
DOUG: I do n't believe you .
JACEY: Believe it or not . I do n't care .
DOUG: You 're full of shit .
JACEY: Then why do n't you go ask Mom ? Ask her what happened ask he why she does n't have any friends ask her why she 's never invited to the Abbott 's ask her which side of the tracks we live on ? Jacey shoves the cash register drawer shut .
PAMELA: How long have you been here ?
DOUG: A while .
PAMELA: Are you okay ?
DOUG: I 'm fine . Having fun ?
PAMELA: Yes , I am . Come on , dance with me . She pulls him towards the dance floor .
DOUG: You did n't tell me I had to dance .
PAMELA: Just one dance and we 'll be even . I wo n't have to be mad at you anymore and you wo n't have to be so sorry .
DOUG: What am I supposed to be so sorry about ?
PAMELA: Oh , you 're not sorry ?
DOUG: All right , yeah , I 'm sorry .
PAMELA: Sorry about what ?
DOUG: You always do this to me .
PAMELA: You said you were n't sorry and now you say you are . So maybe I 'm not sure what you 're sorry about ?
DOUG: I 'm sorry for what I 'm supposed to e sorry about . Okay ?
PAMELA: You 're sorry for feeling me up ?
DOUG: Oh , shit , come on , Pam . Dammit . For crying out loud . Forget it .
PAMELA: I accept your apology . Let 's dance .
DOUG: Hi .
PAMELA: Is Jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit ?
DOUG: Home for the summer . It 's cheaper if he stays here fo the summer . He can save more money for school , 'cause he does n't have to pay rent . Money 's tight , you know , we 're sort of poor .
PAMELA: You 're not poor , are you ?
DOUG: Hell you kidding ? Even with Jacey working summers , my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to Penn . I do n't know where the money 'll come from fo me to go to college .
PAMELA: They 're just separated .
DOUG: What 's the difference ?
PAMELA: I do n't know , you 'll have to ask them .
DOUG: So , where 's Eleanor tonight ?
PAMELA: Eleanor 's just not here .
DOUG: Is she pregnant ?
PAMELA: No ! Who said that ?
DOUG: I do n't know , everybody in town is saying something different she got knocked up , she ran away , you old man kicked her out . So , which is it ? Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder .
PAMELA: Why do you hate me so much ?
TED: Excuse me , asshole , but
DOUG: I do n't hate you .
JACEY: You asleep ?
DOUG: Nope .
JACEY: You 're gon na what ?
DOUG: I 'm going to the University of Pennsylvania . I think I 'm going to be an architect , too .
JACEY: Like hell you are .
DOUG: Why not ? Maybe we can be oommates in Philadelphia ?
JACEY: You 're nuts . You 'll never get accepted to Penn . Besides , Mom could n't afford it anyway .
DOUG: I 'll get a scholarship .
JACEY: I had a four-point-0 grade average and I could n't get a scholarship so , I say you got your head up your ass .
DOUG: 'Night .

DOUG: Where 's the thing that goes on the ottom of the jack ?
PAMELA: What thing ?
DOUG: The thing , the base that the jack fits into ? This .
PAMELA: Oh , I thought that was just the 'spare-tire-holder-on-er . '

JACEY: Then I 'll make you a deal .
ALICE: I just came in to get some change .
JACEY: Come to the picnic on Sunday and I 'll wait here and let you leave first , so your mother wo n't see me .
ALICE: I do n't care if my mother sees you .
JACEY: Then you wo n't care if I ask he if she 'd like to join us for an ice tea ?
ALICE: No ! Wait . Jacey turns to her .
JACEY: Sunday . River Point . Around noon .
PAMELA: You think you 'll finish sometime today ? I 'm getting sun stroke .
DOUG: Put the top up .
PAMELA: Stop acting like Jacey . What makes you think you 're so cool ?
DOUG: Because I know all the answers on 'The $ 64,000 Question , ' because I have X-ray vision and I can sing etter than Pat Boone . And ecause I 'm really a negro , but do n't tell anyone around here , 'cause you know what would happen to me .
PAMELA: God , I ca n't even talk to you .
PAMELA: Name one bad thing I 've ever done to you .
DOUG: Why ?
PAMELA: Go on , name one bad thing .
DOUG: What 's the point ?
PAMELA: You tell me , because I do n't get it ! Look , I 'm not rich , my fathe is . And I did n't pick my father . And if I had a choice between having tons of money or having another father , I 'd be absolutely delighted to be poor ! But unfortunately life is not a cafeteria !
DOUG: Life is not a cafeteria ?
PAMELA: You know what I mean !
DOUG: Shit , I 'm supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you 're rich ?
PAMELA: Well , am I supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you 're so poor ?
DOUG: No .
PAMELA: So then just stop it !
DOUG: Stop what ? !
PAMELA: Stop treating me like an Abbott !
DOUG: Well , how am I supposed to treat you ?
PAMELA: Like you used to . Like just plain Pam .
DOUG: You .
JACEY: We are everyone .
ALICE: But you said
JACEY: No , I did n't . I just said a picnic . I did n't say if anyone else was coming .
ALICE: I 'm sorry I thought
JACEY: You did n't come here to see everybody else . You came here to see me . Did n't you ? That 's why you did n't bring Susan along .
ALICE: I 'm married .
JACEY: I thought you were getting a divorce ?
ALICE: I am , but it 's not final yet . Besides , I 'm two years older than you .
JACEY: Good , if the cops come around we 'll tell 'em you bought the beers in the cooler .
ALICE: I knew he would hit me . Peter 's a eal hot-head . I knew if he hit me hard enough , hurt me enough , that even my father would n't stand for it . Then one night I put too much soap in the washing machine and it overflowed . That did it . He punched me . Broke my front tooth .
JACEY: Bastard .
ALICE: So what do you hear from Eleanor ?
JACEY: I do n't . Do you ?
ALICE: No . Did you love her ?
JACEY: We were n't in love , we were in heat . Alice blushes .
ALICE: No .
JACEY: Then why did you marry him ?
ALICE: Because
JACEY: Which tooth was it ?
ALICE: This one . I had it capped . You ca n't really tell , can you ?
JACEY: No . It 's a beautiful mouth .
ALICE: Are you going to kiss me ?
JACEY: I do n't want to scare you .
ALICE: I ca n't see you again , Jacey .
JACEY: Sure you can . There are ways .
ALICE: Oh , God why you ? Why am I telling all these things to you ?
JACEY: Because there 's no one else you can tell them to . Because I 'm the only person you know who will admit to your face that you father 's a bag of shit . The iggest bag of shit in this town . Better head home . Should n't be gone too long .
PAMELA: Who do you look like more , you father or your mother ?
DOUG: Hell , I do n't know .
PAMELA: Well , what did your father look like ?
DOUG: Like a photograph . I never knew him . He died like a month before I was even born . Jacey probably looks more like him than I do . Jacey 's named after him . That 's how he got to be called 'Jacey , ' after his initials , John Charles ,
PAMELA: He died in a car wreck , right ?
DOUG: You never heard about that ?
PAMELA: About what ?
DOUG: Well , it was sort of a car wreck . He drowned , or froze to death , o oth , I do n't know . He was trying to drive out to Mud Island .
PAMELA: Mud Island 's in the middle of the lake .
DOUG: It was winter time , the lake was froze over .
PAMELA: Jesus , that 's pretty stupid . Sorry .
DOUG: It 's all right , it is stupid . Real stupid . He did it on a bet . He bet someone twenty bucks that he could do it . He made it all the way out there , too . He went through the ice on his way back .
PAMELA: One time Eleanor and I snuck out and walked around the yard naked .
DOUG: You did ?
PAMELA: Yeah . It was sort of a dare , too . She dared me , I dared her , so we oth did it .
DOUG: Was this day or night ?
PAMELA: Night .
DOUG: Was there a full moon ?
PAMELA: I do n't remember .
DOUG: You walked around the yard or did you like run from tree to tree ?
PAMELA: We just walked around the yard .
DOUG: Front yard or back yard ?
PAMELA: Back yard .
DOUG: Oh .
PAMELA: Does it matter ?
DOUG: Yeah . Back yard nudity is hypocritical . It 's insincere . People should do and say exactly what they feel or think and not try to hide things .
PAMELA: Okay .
DOUG: Okay .
DOUG: Hi .
PAMELA: Hi .
DOUG: You look pretty .
PAMELA: Really ?
DOUG: Yup .
ALICE: Do n't tell do n't tell anyone what we 're doing do n't tell anyone no one can know , Jacey no one
JACEY: Marry me .
ALICE: Impossible
JACEY: Nothing 's impossible
HELEN: Do n't forget to water my tomatoes !
DOUG: Okay , Mom , okay .
PAMELA: How long is your mom gone ?
DOUG: Two weeks . She goes up every summer to see this friend she went to college with .
PAMELA: Eleanor lives in Chicago .
DOUG: She does ?
PAMELA: Yeah . She 's going to stewardess school .
DOUG: What do they teach you at stewardess school ?
PAMELA: I do n't know . How to wiggle you ottom .
DOUG: Maybe you should go there instead of Bryn Mawr ?
PAMELA: Sorry .
DOUG: Watch it .
PAMELA: It was an accident . Do n't be crabby .
DOUG: You want to go upstairs ?
PAMELA: No .
DOUG: I just thought maybe you were tired of just kissing ?
PAMELA: I 'm not tired of kissing . Are you ?
DOUG: No , but touching is nice .
PAMELA: We are touching .
DOUG: I just you know would like to see what you look like without any clothes on .
PAMELA: Doug !
DOUG: Are n't you curious ?
PAMELA: No , I know what I look like without any clothes on I look naked .
DOUG: Can I touch your breasts ?
PAMELA: Jesus .
DOUG: Just on the outside ?
PAMELA: No . You can kiss me . I like lips .
DOUG: You like lips ?
PAMELA: I like your lips , block-head . I like being here like this . But I 'm not taking my clothes off , 'cause if we do that , you know what we 'll do . And I 'm too I do n't want to be like my sisters . Not if I can help it .
DOUG: Shit
PAMELA: Who is it ?
DOUG: My brother . He just went upstairs with your sister .
PAMELA: With Eleanor ?
DOUG: Alice .
PAMELA: Why did n't you tell me ?
DOUG: Hell , I did n't know . What does this got to do with us ?
PAMELA: My God what is she doing ?
DOUG: Why is it okay for you to sneak around with me , but it 's not all ight for Alice to sneak around with Jacey ?
PAMELA: Because I 'm not Alice ! And you 're not Jacey ! Alice is is like my mom , they both get hurt so easy , they 're like turtles without shells .
DOUG: Come on , take it easy .
PAMELA: You do n't know my father . You do n't know how he is about Jacey . He blames him for everything that happened with Eleanor .
DOUG: Eleanor fooled around with lots of guys , it 's not Jacey 's fault you dad kicked her out .
PAMELA: Oh , Jesus ! He did n't kick he out , he put her in a nut house ! He shipped her off to this clinic in Wisconsin .
DOUG: But I thought you said she 's in Chicago ?
PAMELA: She is now . They let her out a month ago .
DOUG: Oh , shit .
PAMELA: Yeah . Shit .
JACEY: Alice wait !
ALICE: Go away .
JACEY: It 's the truth , you know it is .
ALICE: No , no , it 's all just screwing .
JACEY: It 's called making love .
ALICE: Do n't .
JACEY: Do n't what ?
ALICE: Do n't follow me . He grabs her arm and stops her .
JACEY: What 's wrong ?
ALICE: I spend all day , every day , just waiting and waiting to be with you , waiting to forget everything , you make me forget but then when I get dressed and I come home , you just leak out of me . Leak away . I go into the athroom and I wash you off of me and I remember everything .
JACEY: Remember what ?
ALICE: Yes , Daddy
LLOYD: Who are you talking to ?
PAMELA: Just girl talk .
LLOYD: You can talk inside . It 's late . Pamela and Alice go inside the house . Jacey exhales , he is ashen .
DOUG: Hi .
PAMELA: Hi .
DOUG: What 's up ?
PAMELA: I 've been thinking maybe we should n't see each other right now .
DOUG: Oh , yeah ? Why ?
PAMELA: Well if my father I do n't eally care what would happen to me if he found out I was seeing you , but I have to take care of Alice and my mother and Eleanor , and well , it would be hard fo me to do that if I were in the doghouse , too . You know ?
DOUG: Christ , why do you have to take care of them ?
PAMELA: No one else will .
DOUG: Okay . Sure . See you around .
HELEN: Who 's upstairs with Jacey ?
DOUG: Alice Abbott .
HELEN: How long is she likely to stay ?
DOUG: I do n't know , but I would n't hold up dinner .
HELEN: Do you want dinner ?
JACEY: No , thanks .
HELEN: Do n't sit on the swing Doug just painted it .
JACEY: I know . I had to bring her here today . She could n't see me tonight and there was nowhere else we could go .
HELEN: I can appreciate that , Jacey , ut
JACEY: I love her , Mother . I 'm going to marry her .
HELEN: Do her parents know about this ?
JACEY: Of course not .
HELEN: Do n't you think they should ?
JACEY: I do n't give a damn about them .
HELEN: Does Alice feel the same as you do ?
JACEY: She loves me .
HELEN: Has she agreed to marry you ?
JACEY: She will . She needs time . She 's frightened . It 's not easy fo her .
HELEN: How does hiding it from her family make it any easier ?
JACEY: We do n't have any choice .
HELEN: Alice is a grown woman , she 's a mother with a child of her own ; if she really loves you then she should
JACEY: All that matters is that I get he away from them before they find out .
HELEN: I ca n't be a party to that , Jacey .
JACEY: I do n't need your help . I 'm not asking for it .
HELEN: You 'll have to find somewhere else to take Alice I ca n't have you inging her here again . I 'm sorry . She steps away from the screen door .
JOAN: Alice ? Did you hear me ? Susan cut her finger on the piano pedal . Alice disappears at the top of the stairs .
HELEN: Pamela , are you all right ?
PAMELA: I need to talk to
JACEY: What 's wrong ?
PAMELA: Alice took some pills , some of my mother 's pills
JACEY: Oh , Jesus , no
PAMELA: She 's all right , we took her to the hospital
JACEY: I 'll get dressed
PAMELA: No !
JACEY: I have to see her .
PAMELA: No . That 's why she sent me , she does n't want you to come , she was afraid you would if you heard from someone else . She 's all right .
JACEY: But I have to see her .
PAMELA: Dammit , no ! I 'm warning you , just wait ! I 'll let you know just as soon as she can see you . Please , do n't make things worse . Do n't .
JACEY: Jesus
JACEY: How is she ?
PAMELA: She 's all right .
JACEY: Can I see her ?
PAMELA: At the boathouse at the lake . Jacey turns and dashes up the driveway .
DOUG: What 's going on ? She looks at Doug with tears in her eyes .
PAMELA: I had to for Alice 's sake .
DOUG: Had to what ? What ?
PAMELA: Tell Jacey I 'm sorry . Pam drives away .
LLOYD: I have plans for my daughters , Mr. Holt , and they do n't include you . I know you . I know you bette than you know me . I know all there is to know about screwing your way into a wealthy family . I 'll never let you screw your way into mine .
JACEY: Where is she ? Where 's Alice ? Jacey turns and rushes out of the boathouse .
JOAN: Dear God !
JACEY: Where is she ? ! Alice ! Alice !
JOAN: Who do you think you are ?
JACEY: Dammit , where is she ? !
JOAN: Get out !
JACEY: Alice !
JOAN: Get out of here !
JACEY: Alice !
LLOYD: Call the police , Joan . Joan hurries away .
JACEY: You son-of-a-bitch ! Where is she ? !
LLOYD: Behind you , Mr. Holt
JACEY: Come with me . Please , Alice , just come with me now , right now .
ALICE: I told you I ca n't
LLOYD: Now , get out of here , you runt stud . And keep your poor-boy dick out of my daughters .
HELEN: Why spend all night and half the day tomorrow waiting in Chicago for the Philadelphia bus ? Why not just wait and take the morning bus to Chicago ?
JACEY: Because the sooner I get out of this fucking town the better .
HELEN: Suit yourself .
DOUG: Dammit why ca n't he just leave them alone ?
HELEN: Who ?
DOUG: The Abbotts . I do n't know why why could n't he just forget 'em ? Just pretend they did n't even exist ?
HELEN: If the Abbotts did n't exist , Jacey would 've had to invent them , one way or another . There are no ends of Abbotts in the world , if that 's what you need .
DOUG: What do you mean , how do you know ?
HELEN: I was just a wreck when Charlie died .
DOUG: Why ?
HELEN: After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott started dropping by on his way home from work . He felt so bad about that bet Charlie made with him at the lake . That foolish , idiotic bet . Poor Lloyd I felt sorry for him . He 'd have a cup of coffee with Mother and me . If a doorknob had come off he 'd fix it . He 'd carry the garbage cans to the curb . Someone dies , people try to e helpful . But he was by here so often that people started to talk . It was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee . I suggested that he did n't need to stop by here so often , but then one afternoon I was at Woolworth 's , having lunch at the counter . All of sudden Joan Abbott was standing there screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with he husband , with Lloyd . I was speechless . She was gone before I could find my tongue .
DOUG: Christ
HELEN: I went to see Joan , I tried to talk to her , to put her mind at ease , but
DOUG: Dammit , why did n't Lloyd tell he that nothing had happened ?
HELEN: I 'm sure he did , but men always say that , darling . Besides , Lloyd was always having affairs . He 's that type of man .
DOUG: Ahhh , Jesus but why ? Why did everyone in town believe Joan Abbott ?
HELEN: Because she 's Joan Abbott . If you cross Joan you do n't get invited to her parties and the Abbotts have the best parties in town . The only parties .
DOUG: I hate this town . I hate the Abbotts .
HELEN: I 'm sorry , Doug , I should n't have told you .
DOUG: I already knew .
HELEN: People still talk about it ?
DOUG: No , I 've never heard anyone talk about it . Not to me .
HELEN: Then how did ?
DOUG: Jacey .
HELEN: Oh , Lord he knows too ?
DOUG: Yeah . But he thinks it really happened .
JACEY: Airplanes , bridges , skyscrapers , as , all utilize the same fundamentals of structural design
JACEY: A stable foundation that resists compression
DOUG: Hey ! Hey ! Pam !
PAMELA: Hi .
DOUG: What are you up to ?
PAMELA: I come down to use the library sometimes or go shopping .
DOUG: How 's Bryn Mawr ?
PAMELA: Very Bryn . I got to catch the us back .
DOUG: Just have to drop off these set designs you want to go get something to eat ?
PAMELA: I ca n't . Sorry .
DOUG: Why not ? It 's been a long time .

DOUG: And you seem not so plain . So , dinner , okay ?
PAMELA: I ca n't . I have to go to this party .

PAMELA: Just a party I got roped into going . Maybe some other time , okay ? I mean it , really .

PAMELA: Okay . Bye .
DOUG: Bye . Doug watches her cross the street .
DOUG: Come on up we go . Pam ? Pam keels over and vomits .

PAMELA: I 'm sorry , Doug .
DOUG: Shit . That 's it ? You 're sorry ?
PAMELA: Oh Jesus did we ?
DOUG: Oh-Jesus-did-we what ?
PAMELA: Did we do it ?
DOUG: What do you think ?
PAMELA: I do n't remember
DOUG: Goddammit . Well , I know you might find this hard to believe , but I do n't sleep with drunks . He walks away . She calls after him .
PAMELA: Doug ? Hey !
PAMELA: Doug ! Open the window ! Come on , I 'm freezing . Doug !
DOUG: If you feel like you 're gon na puke use the wastebasket there .
PAMELA: I 'm sorry . I am so sorry . I was embarrassed . I did n't know where I was when I woke up . I felt like I was dying , so , I just I was going to call you .
DOUG: You want to hear something stupid ?
PAMELA: What ?
DOUG: When I was cleaning you up , wiping the puke off your face , I suddenly ealized how much I miss you how much I love you . How 's that for stupid ?
PAMELA: I love you . But it 's too late .
DOUG: Why ?
PAMELA: Everything 's too screwed up .
DOUG: No , no , it 's not too late . It 's perfect timing . We 're on our own now . No Jacey and Eleanor o Jacey and Alice . That 's what stinks about being the youngest , we have to sweep up afte everybody else . But now it 's just us . It 's our turn .
PAMELA: How can you be in love with me ?
DOUG: How can you be in love with me ?
PAMELA: 'Cause I 've always have been . You block-head .
DOUG: Hi .
PAMELA: Hi .
DOUG: You want to see something ?
PAMELA: What ?
DOUG: Come on .
PAMELA: What are we doing here ?
DOUG: I want to show you something .
PAMELA: Doug !
DOUG: The senior acting class does scenes from different plays , they invite everybody , it 's a real big deal . So , there 's this competition among all the theate design students to do the sets . And anyway I 'm the one whose design got picked .
PAMELA: What scene is it for ? What play ?
DOUG: Umm Romeo and Juliet . It 's something different , I think that 's why they picked it . Everybody else was doing castles and stuff . Rooftop Romeo and Juliet by Douglas L. Holt .
PAMELA: You 're really good at this .
DOUG: It 's like building models when I was a kid . It 's fun . It 's make-believe .
PAMELA: You know , they tore that old farmhouse down ?
DOUG: Oh , no . Did they ?
PAMELA: Yeah .
DOUG: They always tear down the wrong stuff .
PAMELA: Oh , Jesus , I missed you so much .
DOUG: Missed you , too .
PAMELA: No .
DOUG: Well , what ? You worried what you old man would think ?
PAMELA: He does n't care what I do , as long as I do n't do it in Haley .
DOUG: Then what 's the problem ?
PAMELA: I ca n't do this .
DOUG: Why not ? I mean okay . We do n't have to go so fast . Shit , I 'm sorry . I blew it again , huh ?
PAMELA: No , I did .
DOUG: How ?
PAMELA: I 'm on probation . They pulled a ed-check the night I was here . I have to be back in the dorm by ten . Got ta go .
DOUG: What about tomorrow ? I could come up in the afternoon and
PAMELA: No ! It 's just too late . It 's all messed up . I ca n't seem to make things all right . The more I try the worse everything gets . I 'm sorry .
DOUG: Pam ! It 's not too late !
CLERK #1: Pam some guy named Doug keeps calling for you .
JACEY: What 's wrong with you ?
DOUG: Nothing .
PAMELA: Hi .
DOUG: How did you know I was here ?
JACEY: I told you not to come by on Sundays .

JACEY: Well , I did n't expect to see you again . You want to fuck ? I mean , that 's why you came over , right ?
PAMELA: Sure .
JACEY: Then take off your clothes .
DOUG: Fuck you .
JACEY: I did n't know .
DOUG: You did n't know what ? !
JACEY: How you felt about Pam .
DOUG: Fuck you .
JACEY: I 'm sorry .
DOUG: Apologize to her , you asshole !
JACEY: I did . I ran into her a few weeks ago at a party . She was drinking and I it was easy . She felt guilty about telling her father about Alice and me . Actually , I made her feel guilty , I made her feel like she had betrayed Alice .
DOUG: She did n't betray Alice ! She was just trying to get rid of you so Alice would n't try to kill herself again . Jesus Christ , you shit- head , Alice could n't marry you !
JACEY: I know . I mean , I do now .
DOUG: Then what the hell did Pam ever do to deserve your revenge ?
JACEY: Nothing .
DOUG: Just your way of evening the score with Lloyd Abbott , right ?
JACEY: Right .
DOUG: I do n't know you ! I do n't know who the fuck you are ! You fuck everything . You fuck everything up ! Why did you have to fuck Pam , too ? !
CLERK #2: She 's not here .
DOUG: I 'll wait .
CLERK #2: But she left .
DOUG: What do you mean ?
CLERK #2: She left last night .
DOUG: Where did she go ?
CLERK #2: I do n't know .
DOUG: Well , did she go home ?
CLERK #2: No one seems to know . She just took some clothes and left .
DOUG: Oh , God no
CLERK #2: Look , I 'm not supposed to do this , ut well , I can give you he home address .

ALICE: I do n't know .
DOUG: In Chicago ?
ALICE: I do n't know .
DOUG: I could n't find Eleanor 's name in the Chicago phone book .
ALICE: Maybe it 's unlisted .
DOUG: Well , do you know Eleanor 's address ?
ALICE: No . I do n't know her address , I do n't know her phone number . You 'd have to ask my father fo it . All right ?
DOUG: Are you okay ?
HELEN: I 'm fine .
DOUG: You look tired .
HELEN: Just a cold .
DOUG: You sure ?
HELEN: I do wish Jacey had come home fo Christmas . Maybe that 's what 's wrong with me .
DOUG: I guess that free-lance drafting job was too good for him to turn down .
HELEN: I do n't think that 's why he did n't come home . I wrote him a letter , you know . About Lloyd and me . Has he mentioned it to you ?
DOUG: No .
HELEN: Oh I bought those for you . I had them in the basement ; I kept forgetting to bring them up . He does a bemused take on her .
DOUG: Here . Have one with me .
HELEN: I bought those for you , honey .
DOUG: It 's not good to drink alone , Mom .
HELEN: Do n't be silly .
DOUG: Come on . Sit down . Have a beer .
DOUG: Merry Christmas .
HELEN: Merry Christmas . It 's beer .
DOUG: Let 's drink 'em all . Helen laughs girlishly .
HELEN: Charlie was always trying to get me to drink beer .
DOUG: Why do you always call him Charlie ?
HELEN: That was his name .
DOUG: Why do n't you ever say 'you father ' ?
HELEN: Sometimes I do , do n't I ? I do n't know . When I think of him , I think of 'Charlie . '
DOUG: Did you ever meet anybody else ?
HELEN: You mean another man ?
DOUG: Yeah .
HELEN: Well , everyone always thinks things are more possible than they are . I mean , single men do n't stay in Haley if they have any starch . The only eligible man around was Drew Carter , but he smells like his dog .
HELEN: I wish I 'd remembered the beers sooner . It 's nice to see you smiling .
DOUG: Sorry .
HELEN: Do n't be . Everyone has sad times .
DOUG: 'Used to see him ' you do n't see him anymore ?
HELEN: No .
DOUG: Did you like him ?
HELEN: He was a wonderful man . A little oring , but really , very wonderful .
DOUG: How long did this go on ?
HELEN: About eight years or so , it was when you boys were still at home .
DOUG: That 's a long time . Did you eve think about marrying him ?
HELEN: He proposed . But , well , obviously , I said no .
DOUG: Why ?
HELEN: Because I 'm in love with you father . With my memory of him . He was the one for me . Oh , I do n't know there 's different kinds of love , darling . Some people you love no matter what . Other people you love if the situation is right . To me the est kind of love is the 'no matter what ' kind . Well , I am a cheap drunk , are n't
HELEN: Too much noise , please . Let 's finish up . Keep the glue on the paper . Sam , Lillian , Jack in your seats , please
DOUG: What-the-hell do you want ?
JACEY: Mom
ELEANOR: Hi , Doug !
DOUG: Yeah . I have a little scar .
ELEANOR: You going home ? Back to Hole-in- the-Ground , Illinois .
DOUG: My mother died .
ELEANOR: Oh God . Oh no . Oh , Doug , I 'm sorry .
DOUG: She had cancer . I just saw he Christmas . She was tired , but I thought she just had the flu o something . She did n't tell us . The hospital told Jacey when they called him .
ELEANOR: How is Jacey ?
DOUG: He had to stay to take his state oard exams . He 's coming back the day after tomorrow .
ELEANOR: He 's an architect ?
DOUG: If he passes his exams . He will .
ELEANOR: I 'm so sorry , Doug .
DOUG: You know , I tried to find you phone number a couple of months ago .
ELEANOR: It 's in my roommate 's name , I 've got to fix that .
DOUG: I was wondering if you knew where Pam was ?
ELEANOR: No . I do n't .
DOUG: She left school .
ELEANOR: I know . My father called me .
DOUG: Tell Pam I love her . Eleanor looks at him .
JACEY: Why ? Why did n't she tell us ?
FUNERAL DIRECTOR: Gentlemen
JACEY: Fucking hypocrites every one of 'em .
DOUG: You can have it .
JACEY: You sure ?
DOUG: Yeah . Jacey steps out of the dining room .
DOUG: I 'm starving . You want to go get something to eat ?
JACEY: Sure .
DOUG: You do n't have to stick around . I can handle things here .
JACEY: What about school ?
DOUG: I hate Penn . Always have . You were right .
JACEY: About what ?
DOUG: I should live my own life . Stop eing your shadow . I 'm not like you , Jacey I do n't want to be like you .
JACEY: You going to stay here ? In Haley ?
DOUG: No . I was thinking New York . If I 'm going to really learn how to design sets , that 's the place to do it .
JACEY: I 'm sorry .
DOUG: I know you are . Did you have to get stitches ?
JACEY: Hmmm ?
DOUG: Your eyebrow .
JACEY: My eyebrow yeah , ten stitches .
DOUG: Sorry .
JACEY: What is it ?
DOUG: A letter of agreement between Lloyd Abbott and Dad . Dad sold him the file drawer patent not Mom .
JACEY: A car ?
DOUG: Yup .
JACEY: Jesus Christ he sold the patent for a used car ?
DOUG: Used cars were the only kind of cars around . The war was on everything was mobilized . They stopped making new cars , they were making tanks and bombers in Detroit . And even Midwest Steel was n't making desks , they were making ammo boxes and morta shells .
JACEY: How did you get to be such an expert on World War Two ?
DOUG: U.S. History high school . I should be an expert , I had to take the damn class twice . I guess Dad needed a car and he figured who- the-hell needed a full-suspension file drawer ?
JACEY: '1937 Desoto coupe convertible as is . '
DOUG: Wonder whatever happened to it ?
JACEY: He parked it at the bottom of the lake .
JACEY: Do me a favor . Do n't stand here and wave good-bye it makes me think of Mom .
DOUG: Okay . See you .
LLOYD: What do you want ?
DOUG: I want to talk to you .
LLOYD: Shut the door .
DOUG: No thanks .
LLOYD: Sit down .
DOUG: I do n't want to .
LLOYD: Then do n't . I 'm sorry about your mother .
DOUG: Sorry about what ?
LLOYD: You did n't know your mother at all if you think someone like me would 've ever stood a chance with someone like her . That just goes to show you how stupid this town is that they 'd believe she slept with me . That 'd make Charlie laugh . Your old man was my best friend . He used to call me 'Egg-head ' hell , everybody did . And back then everybody knew that Egg-head Abbott did n't stand a snowball 's chance in hell with Helen Riley . Of course , that was all before I became Lloyd Abbott Mr. Abbott . That was back when I still had chicken shit on my shoes and twelve cents in my pocket . Charlie Holt was the only one good enough for Helen . I used to spy on 'em yup , I did . Used to watch them sit on the front porch of her house you house and watch 'em talk .
JOAN: Lloyd ?
LLOYD: Get out of here !
JOAN: It 's time for Susie 's birthday cake .
LLOYD: Goddammit , Joan , go way ! Get the hell out of here ! Leave me alone !
LLOYD: So , what do you want ?
DOUG: I want to find Pam and you 're going to tell me where she is .
DOUG: Where is she ?
PAMELA: How can you ?
DOUG: How can I what ?
PAMELA: Ever forgive me ?
DOUG: You always loved me no matter what I did , right ?
PAMELA: Yeah .
DOUG: Maybe that 's how I love you no matter what . That 's the best kind of love , you know ?
PAMELA: But oh , Jesus how do we start all over again ?
DOUG: There . We 're doing it .
PAMELA: Doing what ?
DOUG: Starting over . So , what are you doing tonight ? You want to go out ?

CHIEF CAVEMAN: Loser kill beast ! Loser caveman hero !
NARRATOR: The world 's first lie . A monumental occasion in the history of mankind .
PAUSE: That lowly caveman who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to ecome chief of his village , married dozens of cavewomen , and passed on the lying gene to hundreds of newborn cave-children .
CHIEF CAVEMAN: Loser , what happen ?
LOSER CAVEMAN: The Beast , it came at me . It smash my cave .
CHIEF CAVEMAN: Loser biggest loser ever ! Caveman , throw rocks at loser !
JENNIFER: Hi . You 're early . I was just masturbating .
MARK: That makes me think of your vagina . I 'm Mark , how are you ?
JENNIFER: A little frustrated at the moment . Also equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight . I 'm Jennifer .
MARK: I hope this date ends in sex .
JENNIFER: Not me . I do n't find you attractive . Come on in .
JENNIFER: I need to finish getting ready . While doing that I might realize I 'm still horny and try to finish masturbating without you hearing .
MARK: I feel awkward and I regret being early .
JENNIFER: I just masturbated .
MARK: That makes me very horny .
JENNIFER: Shall we go ?
MARK: Sure .
JENNIFER: After you .
JENNIFER: I 'm only doing this as a favor fo my cousin Greg . He keeps begging me to go out on a date with you . He says you 're funny .
MARK: Greg 's a good friend .
JENNIFER: Where are we eating tonight ?
MARK: A cute little place called La Bonisera in West Hollywood .
JENNIFER: You obviously do n't have very much money but that 's not necessarily a deal breaker .
MARK: I have very little money .
JENNIFER: I also do n't really care about a guy who knows all the latest , hippest restaurants .
MARK: I do n't know any of them .
JENNIFER: In fact , there are very few things in life that I care about all that much . The only things I have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as intellect .
MARK: I found that boring and started thinking about this place 's fish tacos .
JENNIFER: Hello .
MARK: What are we going to talk about ?
HOSTESS: I 'm threatened by you .
MARK: Two , please .
HOSTESS: Of course , come with me .
WAITER: I 'm very embarrassed that I work here . Hi .
MARK: Hello .
JENNIFER: Hello .
WAITER: And you 're pretty and that only makes me feel worse . Can I get you two started on some drinks ?
MARK: I 'll have a Budweiser .
JENNIFER: I 'll start with your Mango Margarita and probably have three more drinks by the end of the night .
WAITER: Excellent . She 's out of your league .
MARK: Yup .
WOMAN: All of a sudden I got EXTREMELY angry !
MARK: I 'm going to ask you some questions about your life because that 's what you do , but I 'll only really listen to about half of what you 're saying .
JENNIFER: I get up at eight in the morning ecause the noise from my alarm clock interrupts my sleep , so I lean over and
MARK: That 's a little more specific than I expected .
JENNIFER: Well what did you want to know ?
MARK: Do you have a job ?
JENNIFER: Yes .
MARK: What job do you have ?
JENNIFER: I have a job at an office .
MARK: What do you do ?
JENNIFER: Just typing and filing and stuff .
MARK: Do you enjoy it ?
JENNIFER: No . But I enjoy the end result of the job which is money . And the hours are pretty good for the amount of money I make , which I spend on things I like , such as clothes , hiking , drinking even though I know it 's bad for me .
PAUSE: But I 'd rather just get all the money and not work for the results .
MARK: Sure . Tell me more . I 'm trying to get a little insight into you .
JENNIFER: Well you already know a lot about me . You know I 'm good looking ecause well here I am . You know I 'm successful because you 've seen my apartment and the clothes I 'm wearing . And you know I 'm happy ecause I 'm smiling .
MARK: Are you always happy ?
JENNIFER: Usually . Some days I stay in bed eating and crying .
MARK: Sure .
WAITER: Here you go . I had a sip of this .
JENNIFER: Okay .
WAITER: Do you guys know what you want o do you need a moment ?
MARK: I 'm ready .
JENNIFER: I 'll have a caesar salad with chicken because I think I 'm fat but I also think I deserve something that tastes good .
MARK: I 'll have the fish taco 's because I had them once here and it 's all I know .
WAITER: Excellent , I 'll get those both started for you .
JENNIFER: Sorry , one second .
MARK: Do n't think twice . How is your mom ?
JENNIFER: She 's all right .
MARK: Fantastic .
WAITER: If I give you my number will you call me ?
JENNIFER: No .
MARK: Thanks for going on this date with me . You 're way , way out of my league and I know you were just doing it as a favor to Greg , and that most likely I 'll never hea from you again .
JENNIFER: I actually had a better time than I thought I 'd have , but I wo n't know for sure how I feel about you until I 'm less drunk .
MARK: Give me a call if you still like me once you 're sober .
JENNIFER: I might .
MARK: Thanks for kissing me on the cheek , I know you did n't have to do that and .
JIM: Hi , I 'm Jim and I 'm the spokesperson for the Coca-Cola company . I 'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke . I 'm sure it 's a drink you 've been drinking for years , and if you still enjoy it , I 'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon . It 's asically just brown sugar water , we have n't changed the ingredients much lately , so there 's nothing new about it I can say . We changed the can around a little bit . See , the colors here are a little different , and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids . Also , coke is very high in sugar , can lead to obesity in children and adults who do n't sustain a healthy diet , and has a Ph acidity level high enough to dissolve teeth and bones ove extended periods of time . Coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening usted bolts . So that 's it , it 's coke . Everyone knows it . It 's very famous . I 'm Jim , I work for coke , and I 'm asking you to not stop uying coke . That 's all . Thanks .
FRANK: Hi Mark . How 's it going ?
MARK: Not so good . Last night I went on a date with a girl I 've had a crush on for years who will most likely never call me again and I 'm pretty sure I 'm going to get fired today . You ?
FRANK: I spent the whole night throwing up pain killers because I 'm too afraid to take enough to kill myself .
MARK: See you tomorrow .
FRANK: Bye .
BUSINESS MAN: I 'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone . I only want people to assume I 'm very busy .
GIRLFRIEND: I woke up this morning and realized that , not only do I not love you , ut that the thought of touching you sickens me .
BOYFRIEND: The more you hate me the more I fall in love with you .
HONKING MAN: Move it , fatty !
SCREAMING MAN: This is n't natural ! None of this is natural ! We 're all animals ! This does n't feel right ! Why am I wearing clothes ? How can you people live like this ? Where did all this concrete come from ? !
TOUR GUIDE: All of Lecture Films ' productions are written , filmed and edited ight here on this very lot . In fact , this building is where Lecture Films ' talented writers scour through the world 's past events , searching for the most entertaining , dramatic and even hilarious moments of world history , which are then turned into scripts , handed over to our world-famous Readers , and filmed for you viewing pleasure .
NARRATOR: Coming this summer from Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios . Written by Oscar winning screenwriter Rob Marlowe .
NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE: And so Napoleon invaded Russia with a brute force of nearly seven hundred thousand men behind him armed with muskets and supported by canon brigades .
TOURIST #1: I love these films . Saves me eading the book .
NARRATOR: Napoleon 1812 to 1813 . Coming this summer from Lecture Films .
TOUR GUIDE: Look everyone , there goes Mark Bellison , one of Lecture Films very own screenwriters !
PAUSE: I also hear he 's most likely getting fired today .
TOUR GUIDE: Now let 's head to editing bay where we can watch .
MARK: Hi Shelley . I 'm still attracted to you today .
SHELLEY: Hi Mark . Everyday I realize more and more how over-qualified I am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours .
MARK: Any messages ?
SHELLEY: Anthony 's coming by within the hou to see if he can work up the courage to fire you . If he ca n't , he said he 'll definitely do it tomorrow .
MARK: Nobody else called ? No calls to do with actual work ?
SHELLEY: Well , I told everybody you were getting fired this week and not to expect their calls returned , so no one left any messages .
MARK: Next time I 'd rather you took down the messages just in case I do n't get fired .
SHELLEY: You 're almost definitely getting fired .
MARK: Well , it has n't happened yet .
SHELLEY: Okay , but everybody knows you are .
MARK: Okay , I 'll be in my office .
SHELLEY: Okay , I 'll be searching for new jobs on Craigslist .
ANTHONY: Wow , you look really depressed today . That 's going to make this so much harder .
MARK: Anthony , do n't fire me .
ANTHONY: Mark , the 1300 's are boring . Nothing interesting happened in that century . Nobody cares about the post-Roman , pre-enlightenment era . The last few scripts you turned in were depressing .
MARK: They were about the black plague ! It 's the 1300 's Anthony , what else am I going to write about !
ANTHONY: It 's not totally your fault , Mark . You got stuck with a bad century .
MARK: No ! I can make it work !
ANTHONY: Give it up Mark , it 's not like something new is going to have happened in the 1300 's . At Lecture Films we 're no longer interested in searching through the less well- known historical periods for great events , we just want to take the ig name Reader 's of the day and have them read the historical events that people know and love the holocaust , D-day , the birth of electricity . These are the stories people want to see , because they know them . They find comfort in them .
MARK: Is there anyway you could do it now ? I 'd rather not put it off .
ANTHONY: You 're fired ?
MARK: Damn .
MARK: She 's a really good writer , too .
SHELLEY: I loathed almost every minute I worked for you .
MARK: I often fantasized about you naked .
SHELLEY: What are you going to do now ?
MARK: I have no idea . But I have very little hope for the future .
SHELLEY: I do n't have much hope for you either , but I wish you good luck .
MARK: Bye , Shelley .
SHELLEY: Bye , Mark .
ROB: So they fucking fired you , huh dipshit ? I always knew the Black Plague would never work as a movie . Guess the 1300 's were as much of a loser as you are .
MARK: Please do n't make me feel worse . O actually whatever , go ahead , I do n't think I could possibly feel worse .
ROB: I fucking always hated you . You 're a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and you 're a little man bitch . But I was always threatened by you because I knew there was something different about you that I did n't understand and I fucking hate things I do n't understand . But you will always be a loser and I will always be more successful than you in nearly every way . That 's just the way it is . And Shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back .
MARK: Well , now I feel worse .
RECEPTIONIST: Are you looking to abandon an elderly person ?
MARK: I already have . Martha Bellison . I 'm her grandson .
RECEPTIONIST: Ooh , it 's good you 're here . She 's not doing well . You should say you final goodbyes today .
MARK: You say that every time I 'm here .
RECEPTIONIST: She 's at the top of our death pool .
MARK: Oh Grandma , that is so depressing . Come on , at least stare at the ceiling or something .
MARTHA: The television is broken .
MARK: The television is n't broken . You probably sat on the remote and changed it to channel two again .
MARTHA: I do n't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry .
MARK: I ca n't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you 're stupid . But I also love you and wish things were better for you .
MARTHA: I do too .
MARK: Grandma , I lost my job today . I 'm forty years old . I 'm completely alone and I 've got absolutely no prospects for anything .
MARTHA: I 'm sorry , Mark . Things are n't any etter for me here . I ca n't afford most of my medication , I 'm very alone and I forget more and more every day .
MARK: I 'm just so tired of life . Why does life have to be so what 's the word ? Do n't you sometimes wish you could change things ? Do n't you sometimes wish you were n't such a loser ?
MARTHA: I do n't think I 'm a loser .
MARK: Of course you 're a loser , grandma . Our family is made up of losers . We 're all poor , we 're all average looking , we 're all only moderately intelligent , we 're all lonely and unloved .
MARTHA: Well , we 're poor because we were n't orn with money and it 's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another . We 're only moderately intelligent because there 's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage . And we 're only lonely and unloved right now . Remember , I 've had two husbands I loved very much in my lifetime .
MARK: Yeah , but I 'm not talking about the past , Grandma . I 'm talking about ight now . And right now we 're both losers , Grandma . We 're both shitty , shitty losers . Do n't you know that ?
MARTHA: I suppose we are . But things could e worse . We could be homeless .
MARK: I 'd rather be dead than be homeless . That 's why I need to get out there and find a job . If I have to be homeless , I 'm going to kill myself .
MARTHA: Well that 's sad . I love you , Mark . Good luck finding a job !
MARK: I love you too , Grandma .
GREG: Lately I do n't like Indian people .
PAUSE: I do n't like white people even more though . I fucking hate white people . I fucking hate people .
MARK: Hey , thanks for setting me up with your cousin by the way .
GREG: Third cousin . She 's hot right ?
MARK: Very .
GREG: Way out of your league . Dunno why you bothered .
MARK: It felt nice to go out with someone that pretty . Like for just one moment I experienced what it would e like to be the type of person someone like that would date . It felt good . Does n't matter anyway . I will always be just who I am right now average looking , of average intelligence with an average personality . Just a completely generic human being .
GREG: Your life is still better than mine .
MARK: By a good margin .
GREG: Lately I 've been crying in my sleep and waking up in a pool of urine .
MARK: I really wish I had a better friend than you .
GREG: So , what are you going to do now ?
MARK: I do n't know . Guess I 'll start looking for another crappy job .
GREG: Doubt you 'll find one . Not much need for an out-of-work write specializing in the Black Plague .
MARK: I 'm going to go now . You 're seriously depressing me . I really wish I was cool enough to have a etter friend than you .
GREG: I 'm the best you 're gon na get , man . Call me later .
MARK: Yeah .
LANDLORD: I 'm here for the rent .

LANDLORD: You 've got three hundred dollars . Rent a truck .
MARK: Oh , fuck me .
BANK TELLER: How can I help you today ?
MARK: I 'd like to make a withdrawal .
BANK TELLER: Okay , sir . I 'm confident I can help you with that .
MARK: I 've just been evicted from my apartment so I need to withdraw what I have left in my account so I can move my things out . I guess I need to close out my account to do that .
PAUSE: I think I 'm about to be homeless .
BANK TELLER: Unfortunately sir the system is down right now so I 'm not going to e able to perform an account closure until the system is back up . But I can assist you in a withdrawal . How much would you like to withdraw ?

BANK TELLER: Guys the computers seem to be a bit uggy . Will someone call James to come in and look into it , please ?
MARK: It 's no problem .
LANDLORD: What are you doing here ?
MARK: Paying my rent .
LANDLORD: Where did you get this money ?
MARK: It was amazing . I went in to the ank and the system was down and I was going to take out three hundred dollars but she asked me how much I 'd like to take out and

GREG: Well , they 'd just have to .
MARK: Well , they ca n't because we 've got it all .

MARK: We already own the casino . We 've got all the money in the world . We 'll be betting against ourselves .
GREG: Then we 'll go to another casino .
MARK: We own that one too . We won that .
GREG: So we own all the casino 's ?
MARK: Yup .
GREG: And if we win we ca n't pay us back ecause we already have all the money ?

MARK: I 'm not mad at all .
ANTHONY: Oh good , because I feel really bad about it . I mean , I would be horrible at your job too . I would e horrible at any job in this place .
PAUSE: I love sports .
ANTHONY: Why are you here ?
MARK: When you fired me , I was very depressed .
ANTHONY: I knew it .
MARK: And so I left this building and I just started walking . And I walked all the way out of town . And then I walked into the desert and I fell asleep under a tree .
ANTHONY: I do n't do well with other people 's life changing events .
MARK: And when I woke up I found this strange old chest sticking out of the ground . So I started digging . And I unearthed a very old and ancient box . Probably , oh about seven hundred years old . And inside the box was this .
ANTHONY: What is it ?
MARK: It 's a never-before-heard historical event from the past .
ANTHONY: When does it take place ?
MARK: The 1300 's .
ANTHONY: I told you we 're not interested in Black Plague movies here , Mark .
MARK: This one is n't about the black plague . Well it is n't just about the black plague . Let me read you some of this .
ANTHONY: Yeah , but is there a movie there ?
MARK: The greatest movie Lecture Films has ever made .
ANTHONY: Start reading .
MARK: On the very first day of the fourteenth century , a momentous occasion occurred . It began as a day much like any other . The sun ose , the people awoke , workers egan to work , babies began to cry . But all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of Babylon .
ANTHONY: What ? !

JENNIFER: Things seem to be turning around for you .
MARK: Today is the best day of my life . Hands down . Easy . Best day .
JENNIFER: It 's not every day you unearth a monumental historical event and sell it for a ton of money .
MARK: That was n't the best part . It was great , but it was n't the peak of my day .
PAUSE: I 've had a crush on you ever since I saw a picture of you on Greg 's efrigerator two years ago .
JENNIFER: Oh .
MARK: The best part of my day today is ight now , sitting at this table here with you .
JENNIFER: Oh .
MARK: You 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen in my life , and you 're special and it makes me happy to be around you .
JENNIFER: Thank you .
MARK: Ah , my family . We 're what you 'd probably call `` not lucky '' . My whole family is kind of marked by tragedy , bad luck and general shittiness . It goes back a long ways and could probably drive someone to suicide just hearing about it , so I 'll keep it simple . My mom died when I was six . Cancer .
JENNIFER: Sad .
MARK: And my dad got real depressed and lost his job . Out of work and with a kid to raise he had no choice but to turn to a life of crime .
JENNIFER: What kind of crime ?
MARK: He was a robber . Houses mostly .
PAUSE: I hope you 're not there .
MARK: He was a very unlucky man . He spent his last days behind bars . I neve eally knew him . But I guess I 've also had a little luck in my life . I did have a wonderful grandmother who raised me .
JENNIFER: Oh , that 's sweet .
MARK: Yeah , she 's great .
JENNIFER: Where is she ?
MARK: Old person 's home obviously . Who wants to live with that ? Gross .
JENNIFER: I know , right ?
MARK: But I 'm going to get her out of there tomorrow .
JENNIFER: That 's nice .
WAITER: I do n't know what 's wrong with the chef today , but these just look awful .
MARK: They look fine to me .
WAITER: Well , you 're stupid .
MARK: Right . I was thinking that since I 'm going to be rich and successful now that I might be in your league .
PAUSE: And that maybe we could be together . Romantically .
JENNIFER: What would be the point ?
MARK: Well , I do n't know , maybe we might enjoy it . Maybe we 'd be good together and could have a happy life , raise a family together .
JENNIFER: Well , I do like you . And I enjoy your company .
MARK: Good . Fantastic .
JENNIFER: Unfortunately , none of that changes the fact that you 'd still be contributing half of the genetic code to our children .
PAUSE: I do n't want short , fat kids with little snub noses .
MARK: Sure .
PAUSE: What ?
LOUDLY: WHAT ?
MARK: Grandma , they just called me . What 's going on ? Are you okay ?
MARTHA: I do n't know , I fell on my way back to my room .
MARK: What do the doctors say ?
MARTHA: They say I 'll probably die tonight .
MARK: What ?
DOCTOR: Oh , hello . I was just coming in to check on her , you must be Martha Bellison 's grandson .
MARK: What are you talking about she 's going to die ?
DOCTOR: I 'm sorry . It just does n't look good . She 's suffered a major heart attack and her heart is very weak , her pulse not very strong , he lood pressure is dropping rapidly and most likely she 'll have a fatal heart attack during the night .
MARK: Fuck .
DOCTOR: Yup , still going to die .
MARTHA: I 'm so scared , Mark . I do n't want to die . You know , people do n't talk about it much , but death is a horrible thing . One minute you 're alive , there 's a whole world around you , humming and jumping , people coming in and out , doors opening and closing , love and anger and the whole mess of it all , and then like that , it 's all gone .
CRYING: This is it Mark , only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness .
MARK: Grandma !
NURSE #1: She 's seizing .
MARTHA: I 'm scared .
MARK: Listen closely to me , Grandma . I have a surprise for you .
NURSE #1: Go on .
DOCTOR: What else happens ?
MARK: Do your jobs !
NURSE #2: I 'm going to see my mother again when I die .
DOCTOR: Tell us more , please .
MARK: Damn it .
JENNIFER: I 'm so sorry , Mark .
MARK: I think I just did something bad .
JENNIFER: Do you want to come inside ?
MARK: Hi .
NURSE #1: There he is !
PERSON #1: Is there only one place you go when you die ?
PERSON #2: Will everyone who has ever died be there ?
PERSON #3: What 's this place called ?
PERSON #4: Will I get to have sex with people there ?
NURSE #1: You owe us an explanation . If you know something this important , you etter tell us all .
MARK: Who are you people ?
NURSE #1: The words you spoke last night , to your grandmother , spread like wildfire . Please , tell us more . Explain what you said .
MARK: Fine , fine , just give me a minute .
JENNIFER: They 're saying that you know something different about what happens after you die .
MARK: Hold on .
MARK: Fuck .
JENNIFER: Mark , what do you know ? What did you tell your grandmother last night ? What 's going on ?
MARK: I ca n't explain it all right now . Why do n't you come over ?
JENNIFER: Okay .
MARK: Come up quick , they look like they could get out of hand any second .
JENNIFER: Just tell me what you told you grandmother .
MARK: I do n't think I should . Who knows what could happen next ? I 'm just going to keep my mouth shut from now on .
JENNIFER: What you said obviously affected a lot of people . I do n't think you have the choice to keep it in now .
MARK: Sure I do . I could just walk out that door and get on a plane and go to Namibia . No one knows me in Namibia .
JENNIFER: Just tell me what you said . Please , Mark .
MARK: My grandmother was dying , and she was terrified , shaking all over . She did n't want to just become nothingness . So I told her that when she died there would n't be nothingness . That she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness .
JENNIFER: How do you know these things ?
MARK: But you do n't understand . The words I said they were n't it 's not ight .
JENNIFER: How did your grandmother feel when you told her these things ?
MARK: Happy . At peace .
JENNIFER: And how did that make you feel ?
MARK: Good .
JENNIFER: Think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people .
MARK: Okay . But I need a few hours to get my thoughts together .
JENNIFER: I 'll go tell them .
MARK: Wait ! Are you sure this is right ?
JENNIFER: Of course it is . You know something that 's going to change mankind forever . It 's the most important thing the world has ever heard .
GREG: I brought pizza . How come you neve told me we all get mansions ?
MARK: I did n't
GREG: Inventing the bicycle is one thing , ut this
JENNIFER: Shut up . Let him work .
MARK: I 'm done .
JENNIFER: Are you ready ?
MARK: I guess .
JENNIFER: Just tell them what you know
GREG: Good luck out there , man .
YOUNG MAN: I heard that he said we all get mansions , and that there 's even ponies .
NEWSCASTER: Ponies . Mansions . Ice Cream . These are the things we can all expect when we die . What else can we expect ? We wo n't know until Mark Bellison steps out of that
YOUNG MAN: THERE HE IS !
MARK: Hello .

MARK: Tall . Big hands . A good head of hair .
WOMAN #1: What ethnicity is he ?
MARK: He 's a new ethnicity . It 's like a mix of all of our ethnicities .
MAN #2: Does he live on a cloud ?
MAN #3: Can we see him ?
MARK: No . He lives much higher than the clouds , too high to see .
WOMAN #2: So he lives in space ?
MARK: No , not that high .
MAN #3: So you mean the Thermosphere ?
MARK: Look , people I got a lot to get through here . I 'm just telling you what I know Man . Lives in the sky . You ca n't see him . Controls everything . Cool ?
PAUSE: Number three In that place every person will get a mansion .

MARK: I do n't know . Whatever kind of mansion you 're thinking of right now .
WOMAN #3: Oh no ! I was n't thinking of a mansion !
MAN #5: Shit ! I was thinking of a horrible mansion !
MARK: Look , it 's the best mansion you can think of , not just now , but ever . Whatever the best mansion for you can possibly be , that 's the one you 'll get .

WOMAN #6: I 've just thought the chocolate sauce is diarrhea !
MARK: Well do n't put it on then ! What 's wrong with you people ? I mean
MAN #9: Where will you go ?
MARK: A terrible place . The worst place imaginable .

MARK: Fine .

MARK: Yes .

MARK: Then it 's fine .
WOMAN #7: Is cursing bad ?
MARK: No .

WOMAN #2: What about if you forget to feed your dog ?
MARK: That also is fine . Unless the dog dies . Then it 's bad .

CRYING MAN: I 've done many of those bad things . Is there anything I can do to not go to the bad place ? Help me , I 'm so scared .

ASSISTANT: You want me to take this over to Lecture Films ?
MARK: Yeah . Tell them to shoot that one this week .
JENNIFER: You have n't left the house in weeks . Every time I come by you 're just sitting here writing down stories you get from the Man in the Sky .

MARK: Well no , I mean
PAUSE: Do n't go out with him .
JENNIFER: Why not ? He 's a great match for me .
MARK: What 's he got that I do n't ?
JENNIFER: We talked about this . If you and I got together it would n't be fair to our kids . They have the right to be attractive and have good genes .

EXECUTIVE #1: That 's the only plane I 'll ever fly on again !
MARK: That 's the point here guys . With these new advertising strategies , people will buy your products with abandon .
EXECUTIVE #2: But it will take years to replace all of our stock with these new improved products you 've invented .
MARK: No . It wo n't . All you have to do is print these words on the packaging . That 's it .
EXECUTIVE #3: How did you do it ?
MARK: Look , they 're still the same products you have on the shelves ight now . The only difference now is that people wo n't get bummed out or scared when they use them . Is n't that a good thing ?
FAT MAN: Thank the Man in the Sky for this . I 've never been happier in my life . Now I can eat whatever I want , whenever I want .
REPORTER: Are you all right , sir ?
FAT MAN: Yeah . I must just be real happy . It says on the wrapper that they help oost your happiness .
MARK: You should slow down there , Greg .
GREG: Why 's that ?
MARK: Just because the package says it 's not bad for you does n't mean you have to gorge yourself on it .
GREG: But it tastes so good .
MARK: That 's just stupid .
GREG: No it 's not .
MARK: I wish that worked for me , Greg .
GREG: What ?
MARK: Nevermind . I 'll see you around .

BOYFRIEND: The more you push me away , the more attracted I am to you .
HONKING MAN: Move it , fatty !
MARK: Yeah . So are you going to apologize ?
HONKING MAN: For what ?
MARK: Nothing 's really changed . I gave people the Man in the Sky , made myself rich and successful , told the world they can eat whateve they want and feel good about it . Everyone 's happy but me . Because I 'm the only one who knows it all is n't . I made it all up .
PAUSE: You 're not up there living in a mansion . You 're right here . In the ground . That 's all . And I 'm the only one who knows that .

JASON: Me ? Nothing . They say they 're the Presidential bodyguard . They have orders .
BEAT: Signed by you .
MANDELA: Yes . They 've had special training , those boys with the SAS . And lots of experience . They protected De Klerk .

MANDELA: Yes , I know .

MORE: 18 .
BEAT: Please try it .
JASON: Yes , Madiba . Sorry to disturb you .
BARBARA: You ask a lot .
MANDELA: Only what is necessary .
JESSIE: Two copies of the schedule . Jason snatches the file , keeps walking .
LINGA: Can we get rid of these guys , now ?
JASON: This is his schedule for the next month . Let 's look it over for duty assignments .
ETIENNE: Right .
LINGA: What ? Linga and the others are shocked .
JASON: We ca n't . This is what Madiba wants , okay .
ETIENNE: Are there any special orders o conditions ?
JASON: No . Yes . Madiba gets upset if you do n't smile when you push people out of the way .
HENDRICK: Seriously ?
LINGA: Yes , seriously . It 's the new South Africa .
ETIENNE: Madiba ?
JASON: The President 's clan name . It 's what we call him .
ETIENNE: We 'll call him Mr. President . Jason lifts the schedule .
JASON: Let 's get through this .
ETIENNE: How 's he going to do all this ? When does he take a break ?
LINGA: He says he rested enough in prison .
JASON: Here 's a headache .
LINGA: What ?
JASON: A rugby match at Loftus Versfeld . British Lions against the Springboks .
HENDRICK: It 's going to be a headache for the Lions , that 's for sure . We 're going to donder them .
JASON: I do n't care about the game . I care that the President 'll be so exposed .
LINGA: To thousands of drunken
ETIENNE: sports fans ?
JASON: Yes . Sports fans .
LINGA: Who did n't vote for him . Who probably hate him . Who came out of the womb with guns in their hands .

PIENAAR: Thank you , sir .
JASON: Stay with him .
ETIENNE: Stop him .
JASON: Stay with him .
MANDELA: Thank you for honoring our new flag !
JASON: We 're delaying the rugby , Madiba .
MANDELA: Oh , yes , of course . Mandela gives one last wave , turns away .
ETIENNE: Why did n't you stop him ?
JASON: Next time , you try .
ETIENNE: Does he do that sort of thing all the time ?
JASON: Ask my ulcer .
BEAT: Good thing that was just an orange .
ETIENNE: And good thing he never saw it .
JASON: Oh , he saw it . He sees everything . I hate rugby .
PIENAAR: Concentrate , dammit ! Focus ! We can beat these guys if we play ou game , not theirs !
MANDELA: Shall we work while we watch ? We have lots of promises to keep .
BARBARA: Yes , we do .
MANDELA: It 's not too late , if the boys can just pick up their game .
RUGBY PRESIDENT: If they do n't , heads will roll . This is unacceptable .
LEANING FORWARD: Come on you bloody bastards !
BARBARA: Where do you want go first , fo foreign investment ?
MANDELA: Where the money is . America , England , Saudi Arabia . Barbara makes notes .
BARBARA: Do you see all the old apartheid flags ? It 's a disgrace . Mandela lowers his binoculars .
MANDELA: It 's also a constitutional right .
BARBARA: Along with the apartheid anthem . I know . But it 's time people moved on . Mandela grunts , raises his binoculars again .
MANDELA: Look at that . The whites are cheering for the Springboks , the lacks are cheering for the Lions . Mandela lowers the binoculars .
BARBARA: Of course it did .
MANDELA: How long until the World Cup ?
RUGBY PRESIDENT: About a year .
MANDELA: Plenty of time for improvement .
RUGBY PRESIDENT: Mr. President I would n't get my hopes up . We 're a damn disgrace .
MANDELA: I want to go to India and Indonesia , too .
QUIETLY: I 've just been at a meeting of the National Sports Council executive . There 's strong support to drop the Springbok emblem and colors altogether . If they 're playing badly , maybe its a good time to make a change . ( with barely hidden
RELISH: 30 .
BOLAND BOTHA: They left 80 minutes later with their tails between their legs , like whipped mongrels .
BEAT: And I , for one , am glad . Not ecause we lost , but because there 's now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top-notch international ugby .
RUGBY PRESIDENT: Who gets the axe ? Someone has to .
PIENAAR: He 's trying to get them to drop me .
NERINE: He 's just bitter because the Springboks were boycotted when he played .
PIENAAR: Maybe , but people listen to what he says .
MARY: Here 's your muti . I warmed the milk tonight .
MANDELA: You 're too good to me . Mandela takes his pills .
MARY: Your daughter called , to cancel he visit this weekend .
MANDELA: Did she say why ?
MARY: No , she did n't . She said to tell you she was sorry .
MANDELA: No , thank you . I 'm going to bed . Good night .
MARY: Good night , Madiba . Sleep well .
MRS. DLAMINI: God bless you .
MRS. COLEMAN: You 're a very lucky boy . It 's a eal Springbok practise jersey ! It 's a bit big , but it 's warm and it 'll last for ever ! Sipho shakes his head .
MRS. DLAMINI: If he wears it , the others will eat him up .
MRS. COLEMAN: Because the Springboks are playing so badly ?
MRS. DLAMINI: No . Because , for them , the Springboks still represent apartheid .
NSC FIREBRAND: and now for the next item on our agenda . The hall is jammed . Very few white faces .
MORE: 36 .
JASON: Both units to the cars , right now .
BARBARA: What do I tell the Japanese trade delegation ?
MANDELA: I delegate that decision to you .
BARBARA: Do you want me to inform the VP ?
MANDELA: No .
BARBARA: We should at least include the Minister of Sport .
MANDELA: No .
BARBARA: I strongly advise against doing this . Especially on your own . It it gives the impression of autocratic leadership .
MANDELA: Your advice is duly noted , Barbara .
BARBARA: Madiba the people want this . They hate the Springboks . They do n't want to be represented by a team they cheered against all thei lives .
MANDELA: Yes , I know . But in this instance the people are wrong . And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that . Mandela leans forward to talk to Linga .
BARBARA: You 're risking your political capital . You 're risking you future as our leader .
MANDELA: The day I am afraid to do that is the day I am no longer fit to lead .
BARBARA: At least risk it for something more important than rugby .
NSC FIREBRAND: brothers , sisters , comrades , we in the executive applaud you diligence and courage .
CHOIR: Nkosi Sikelel ' iAfrica etc
NSC FIREBRAND: Brothers , sisters , members of the choir we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important . In this case , fo someone truly important . Please welcome President Mandela !
JASON: Smile .
MANDELA: Brothers , sisters , comrades , I am here because I feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information o foresight .
BEAT: Nonetheless , I propose that we estore the Springboks . Restore their name , their emblem and thei colors , immediately .
MANDELA: Let me tell you why
BEAT: For twenty seven years , I studied them . I learned their language , I ead their history , I read thei poetry . I had to know my enemy , in order to prevail against him .
MANDELA: Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner . They are our fellow South Africans , our partners in democracy . Just as quickly , Mandela loses them again .
BEAT: We have to be better than that .
MORE: 42 .
MANDELA: Yes , I know . All the things they denied us .
BEAT: You elected me to be your leader . Let me lead you now .
MANDELA: Who is with me ?
BARBARA: Twelve votes . Twelve !
MANDELA: A luxury . All we needed was one more yes than no .
BARBARA: What if you had n't got it ?
MANDELA: Well , as you know , I am an obedient party member .
BARBARA: I 'm sorry , Madiba , but we 've got problems everywhere we look . Housing , food , jobs , crime , ou currency . You ca n't keep interrupting affairs of state to placate a minority .
MANDELA: But , I must . This minority still controls the army , the police , and the economy . Without them , we can not address the other problems .
BARBARA: So this rugby , it 's just a political calculation ?
MANDELA: It 's a human calculation .
BEAT: If we take away what they cherish the Springboks , their national anthem we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us .
MANDELA: I will do what I must to break this cycle . Or it will destroy us .
ANGRY SPRINGBOK: This beer tastes like kuk .
PIENAAR: It 's not the beer .

LINGA: Think about it , man . He 's separated from his wife . His children how often do you see them here ?

TV ANNOUNCER: his salary is too high .
MR. PIENAAR: Dead right . They 're all overpaid .
TV ANNOUNCER: He has therefore decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity .

HENDRICK: I know how to do my job , okay . Hendrick leaves .
LINGA: Who 's this Pienaar ?
ETIENNE: You ca n't be serious ? He 's the captain of the Springboks . Linga shrugs , provocatively indifferent .
LINGA: I like soccer , myself .
ETIENNE: Well , you know what they say about soccer it 's gentleman 's game played by hooligans . One the othe hand , rugby is a hooligan 's game played by
LINGA: Ja , ja , I 've heard it before . It was n't funny the first time .
PIENAAR: Can I ask you a question , Lieutenant ?
HENDRICK: Ja , of course .
PIENAAR: What 's he like ?
HENDRICK: When I worked for the previous President , it was my job to be invisible . Hendrick opens the door .
PIENAAR: Okay . Thanks .
HENDRICK: What are our chances in the World Cup ? I mean , for real .
PIENAAR: We 'll do our best . That , I can guarantee .
HENDRICK: Well , he 's not as big as he looks on TV .
BEAT: And we do n't stand a bloody chance in the World Cup .
MARY: Mr. Pienaar ? Pienaar shoots to his feet .
MANDELA: Francois , what an honor . I 'm so excited . They shake hands .

MANDELA: The English have given us many things , including rugby , but afternoon tea is one of the greatest . Mandela hands Pienaar the tea cup .
PIENAAR: Thank you , sir .
MANDELA: You have a very difficult job .
PIENAAR: I do ? I sell gas braais . Mandela lets go and Pienaar takes the tea .
MANDELA: Captain of the Springboks . A very difficult job .
PIENAAR: Not compared to yours , sir .
MANDELA: Ah , but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I 'm doing mine . Pienaar grins . True .
PIENAAR: Or they would n't be chosen in the first place .
MANDELA: Yes . But to get people to be etter than that ?
MORE: 62 .
PIENAAR: Yes sir , it is .
MANDELA: How do we do that ? By example ? To an extent . But there is more to it than that ( searching for the right
WORD: inspiration , perhaps .
MANDELA: How do we inspire ourselves to greatness , when nothing less will do ? How do we inspire everyone around us ?
BEAT: Sometimes , I think , by using the work of others . Long pause . Pienaar knows to keep quiet .
MANDELA: On Robben Island , when things were very hard , I found inspiration in a poem .
PIENAAR: A poem ?
MANDELA: A Victorian poem . Just words . But they helped me to stand when all I wanted was to lie down
SUDDENLY DISMISSIVE: But you did n't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense .
PIENAAR: No ! They make a lot of sense , sir .
BEAT: On the day of a big match , say a test , in the bus on the way to the stadium , nobody talks .
MANDELA: Yes yes . Everybody is preparing .
PIENAAR: When I think we 're ready , I have the bus driver put on a song I 've chosen ; a theme song . One we all know . We listen together and it helps .
MANDELA: Yes ! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona . The whole stadium welcomed me with a song .
BEAT: At the time the future ou future seemed very bleak . But to hear that song , in voices from all over our planet it made me very proud to be South African . It helped me to come home and do etter . It allowed me to expect more of myself . A beat .
PIENAAR: May I ask what the song was , sir ?
MANDELA: Well , it was Nkosi Sikelel ' iAfrika . A very inspiring song . Mandela looks into Pienaar 's eyes .
PIENAAR: Yes , sir . We probably do .
NERINE: So ?
PIENAAR: Hm ?
NERINE: What 's he like ?
PIENAAR: He 's
BEAT: he 's not like anyone I 've eve met before .
NERINE: Well ? What did he want ?
PIENAAR: I think
BEAT: I think he wants us to win the World Cup .
MANDELA: Excuse me .
ZINDZI: It does n't matter what I think .
MANDELA: Yes , it does .
ZINDZI: Okay . I think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house when you were in jail . I do n't like seeing you shake his hand . And I 'm not the only one . Mandela overreacts .
MANDELA: You criticize without understanding . You seek only to address your own feelings . This is selfish thinking . It does not serve the nation . Zindzi shakes her head , turns , leaves .
ZINDZI: What is it ?
MANDELA: A bracelet .
ZINDZI: Just throw it away .
MANDELA: I do n't have the right to . It 's not mine .
ZINDZI: If she left it here , she meant to throw it away .
EUNICE: Mrs. Pienaar said you were finished with the paper .

HEAD: Yes yes . This is a great opportunity .
SPRINGBOK MANAGER: I reckon you 've knocked the stuffing out of them today .
COACH: I have n't even begun .
BEAT: We may not be the most talented team in the world but we 're going to be the fittest . He blows his whistle .
COACH: And back !
PIENAAR: Come on boys , let 's show him .
SPRINGBOK FLANK: Shit , what 's Pienaar been eating ? But , they follow him .
MANDELA: Please call the head of South African rugby for me .
RUGBY PRESIDENT: Afternoon men . It 's good to see you working so hard . I have a short announcement .
BEAT: As part of the PR buildup to the World Cup , you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country .
RUGBY PRESIDENT: I know you have plenty on you plates already but this is a equest that comes from the top . ( looking at Pienaar ,
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: This is complete crap .
SPRINGBOK FLANK: Are we some kind of circus act now ?
SPRINGBOK LOCK: We do n't have time for kuk like this . The boys are getting angrier by the second .
CHESTER WILLIAMS: I try not to think . It interferes with my rugby . The perfect answer for these guys .
SPRINGBOK LOCK: See ! Now there 's a rugby player . Talk to them Francois .
SPRINGBOK WING: Make them see that this is a waste of time we do n't have .
PIENAAR: I 'm not going to talk to them .
SPRINGBOK FLANK: Why not ?
PIENAAR: Whether we like it or not , we 're more than just a rugby team . We 're we 're ambassadors inside ou own country . And we might as well get used to it . Silence . Rebellious silence . Then
SPRINGBOK LOCK: Is this you speaking , or Mandela ?
PIENAAR: You know me better than that .
BEAT: Times change . We need to change , too .
TV ANNOUNCER: No one has claimed responsibility yet , but authorities say that the timing and target mark this as the work of white , right-wing fanatics . An act of revenge for the FBI killings in Waco , Texas .
JASON: That 's all we need .

BEAT: Revenge only begets revenge .
SPRINGBOK LOCK: Shit , I 'm glad I do n't live here .
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: What the hell are they doing ?
PIENAAR: Do n't forget , we 've got TV cameras on us at all times .
SPRINGBOK LOCK: What a bloody joke .
PIENAAR: Okay Chester I reckon you 're up .
CHESTER WILLIAMS: What am I supposed to do ?
PIENAAR: What you do best . Pienaar turns to the throng .
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Who here knows the first rule of ugby ?
TOWNSHIP KID: Me !
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: What is it ?
TOWNSHIP KID: Only hit the other players when the ef is n't looking ! Laughter . A good ice-breaker .
PIENAAR: No . The first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards o sideways .
VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS: - If you drop the ball , or pass it forwards , you scrum for possession . - This is a scrum . - You kick forwards .
MORE: 79 .
KIDS: No !
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Agh , bugger it , let 's just run and pass . Whoever drops the ball does pushups !
SPRINGBOK LOCK: Okay . Who wants to scrum against me ?
MANDELA: Mr. Minister , please forgive me . This sounds excellent , and we will eturn to it , but if you 'll indulge me for just one minute
MR. PIENAAR: Tell me something how does this help them win rugby matches ?
BOLAND BOTHA: where the Springbok flight has just landed .

JASON: Yes . No truck bombs , no Oklahoma City .
BEAT: Much too exposed .
MANDELA: Barbara , I have been studying .
BARBARA: For the summit in Taiwan ? Good .

PIENAAR: Sort of . The players look down at the pages .
SPRINGBOK WING: Cappie ? What 's this ?
PIENAAR: We need to learn it . We ca n't just mouth the words anymore .
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Nobody cares , as long as we win matches .
PIENAAR: They do care .
SPRINGBOK LOCK: It 's their song , not ours .
SPRINGBOK WING: It 's a terrorist song .
SPRINGBOK PROP: They used to arrest you for singing it .
PIENAAR: And now it 's one of our anthems .
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Cap . You know I leave my guts on the field for you , and you know I 'd follow you into a fight anywhere , any time . But this
PIENAAR: Okay , boys . It 's optional . Take it if you want to .
BEAT: Which you have to admit , we could use .
BOLAND BOTHA: Tell us , Mr. President , have you always been a rugby fan ?
MANDELA: People do not realize that I once played rugby myself , when I was a student at Fort Hare . It is a very ough game . Almost as rough as politics . Boland laughs .
JASON: We 're going to land you on top of that building . We 'll own the road etween it and the stadium . Mandela likes it .
MANDELA: Francois , gentlemen forgive me for interrupting your work the day efore such an important match
BEAT: I just wanted to wish you good luck , in person . There is a naughty twinkle in Mandela 's eye .

PRISON GUARD: That means he was the 466th prisoner admitted in 1964 .
RECITING "INVICTUS": Out of the night that covers me , Black as the pit from pole to pole , I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul .
BARBARA: What happened ?
DOCTOR: It 's simple exhaustion , but it 'll lead to worse if it 's not treated . He needs complete rest . And I do n't mean just shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom .
MORE: 106 .
MARY: You know him . He wo n't do that .
DOCTOR: Then I 'm going to put him into hospital . In isolation .

DOCTOR: And I 'll come back tonight to make sure he 's not working .
BARBARA: Do n't cancel the trip to Taiwan . Not yet .
COACH: That 's not good enough .
BARBARA: Madiba , this is
MANDELA: I know who this is .
COACH: Forty minute postponement . They 're trying to clear the field .
MANDELA: Please excuse me for a moment .
MARY: The All Blacks play England tomorrow . Then , we 'll know .
MANDELA: Please make sure that my schedule is clear for the entire match .
MARY: Yes , Madiba .
MANDELA: Let 's do some work while we watch .
BARBARA: Just enjoy the rugby .
KWEZI: So , let me understand this . The All Blacks are killing a team that thrashed us last year ?
ETIENNE: Thanks for reminding me .
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: We 're going to have to tackle etter than the English , that 's fo sure .
PIENAAR: We do .
MANDELA: Are those the judicial appointments for the Free State ? and Barbara shuts the file .
BARBARA: They 'll keep until after the match .
ETIENNE: Give it a spin when you pass it .
DEMONSTRATING: Like this .
SPRINGBOK WING: How much does Lomu weigh ?
SPRINGBOK FLANK: About 120 kilos .
SPRINGBOK LOCK: Shit , that 's what I weigh .
SPRINGBOK WING: Ja , but at least you 're slow .
MANDELA: Come and look at this .
HENDRICK: You should 've played rugby .
LINGA: They would n't let me carry my gun .
MANDELA: Do you still think I 'm wasting my time with the rugby ?
BARBARA: This rugby , it 's still strictly political ?
MANDELA: Oh yes . Of course .
PIENAAR: Do n't lose them . I wo n't be able to get more .
MR. PIENAAR: Thanks , Francois . Me , mom , Nerine wait , and the fourth ? Who 's it for ?
MANDELA: 145 points , in one match ? Linga listens openly .
BEAT: They seem unstoppable .
MANDELA: Their Maori war dance . Yes . It 's very powerful .
BEAT: Madiba , we 've already exceeded all expectations . On and off the field .
MANDELA: It 's not enough . Not now . Not so close .
BEAT: This country is hungry fo greatness .
COACH: How 's the feeling in the dressing oom ?
PIENAAR: Calm .
MANAGER: And Lomu ? Are they talking about him ? Pienaar shrugs of course . Coach grins .
COACH: Nobody gives us a bloody chance . I like that . It plays into their one weakness .
BEAT: They 're already counting the win . But they want to win with style , the way they won all their othe matches . They want to show the world how beautiful All Black rugby is .
GLARING: I just want to show the bloody world how hard we tackle . Pienaar 's up for that .
PIENAAR: I wish tomorrow was already here .
ETIENNE: Come on , man . There 's nothing more you can do today . Jason turns to Etienne .
JASON: Have I ever mentioned to you that I hate rugby ?
ETIENNE: Once or twice , yes .
JASON: I just want to get him through tomorrow , safely . That 's all .
ETIENNE: We all do .

PIENAAR: No , tomorrow 's taken care of , one way or another . Pienaar turns to her .
LINGA: Big day .
HENDRICK: Be an even bigger day if we actually won .

LINGA: Okay , thanks . Out . Linga lowers his radio , embarrassed .
HENDRICK: Or was .
LINGA: I had an idea . About today .
BEAT: It 's a crazy idea .
HENDRICK: Hey , do n't worry , man . I already know you 're crazy .
MANDELA: Morning , boys .
HENDRICK: Linga had an idea , sir .
JASON: The tickets sold out long before the team became so popular . So it 's not exactly going to be the ainbow nation out there . That 's the reality .
BEAT: The President will greet the players before the match , he 'll present the trophy after the match . He 'll be exposed to 62,000 people , twice . He 'll be on TV , live , all over the world . ( expressing his deepest
FEAR: All it takes is one idiot trying to make a statement , or one crazy fool who thinks he hears god speaking to him over the radio . One of the cops smiles at that .
JASON: It 's happened before !
TO BOERE: Face flag ?
BOER: Bugger off !
BOLAND BOTHA: because their beloved green and gold have somehow managed to exceed all expectations .
EUNICE: What 's Mr. Francois doing now ?
CAPTAIN: Let it be noted that I 'm taking control of the aircraft .
JASON: Do you see that jet , to the east ?
ETIENNE: Did they get clearance for this ?
JASON: Not from us . The 747 gets closer , fast . Jason is hit by a horrible thought .
LINGA: VIP BOX .
JASON: Get him out of there . Now .
LINGA: No time .
CAPTAIN: Full throttle .
SPRINGBOK WING: What the hell was that ? which slowly fades
PIENAAR: Breathe , boys . Breathe .
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: The All Blacks wo n't like that .
CROWD: Nelson Nelson Nelson
MANDELA: I 'm so glad you 're here . Chester beams .
MR. PIENAAR: DO THAT AGAIN ! 133 .
MANDELA: Hello , Jonah .
PIENAAR: NKOSI
ALL SPRINGBOKS: SIKELEL ' IAFRIKA etc
MANDELA: Perhaps we should make a small wager ?
LINGA: What happens now ?
HENDRICK: Extra time . Twenty minutes .
LINGA: I do n't think I can take it .
PIENAAR: Who 's the fittest team on this field ? The answer lies in their eyes they are .
MANDELA: How long before the end ?
BOLAND BOTHA: Francois a few words
PIENAAR: We did n't have the support of 63,000 South Africans today . We had the support of 42 million South Africans . The crowd roars .
SPRINGBOK MANAGER: They 're waiting for you over there . Pienaar turns , looks .
MANDELA: Francois , I want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country . Pienaar shakes his head .
PIENAAR: Mr. President , I want to thank you for what you have done .
JASON: This route 's too crowded . We 're changing to route B .
MANDELA: Tell Jason it 's all right . There 's no hurry .
LINGA: Madiba says no need to hurry .
MARGARET: How much is the milk ?
DENIS: I like butter .
MARGARET: Milk 's gone up .
DENIS: Good grief ! We 'll have to economise . I suppose we could always sell the car . Or take in paying guests !
MARGARET: Eat your egg .
JUNE: Goodness ! There you are . JUNE 's look of quiet concern .
MARGARET: Yes . MARGARET eats her egg .
JUNE: I do n't understand how it happened , how could she possibly have got out ? It 's very very important -
POLICE GUARD: Dixon . MARGARET slips away .
JUNE: Beautiful day . Oh , you 've made a start . Carol 's coming soon , I 'll get some bags . Anything you want to go to Mark , I 'll bring up a suitcase for it .
MARGARET: No no no no . The grey .
JUNE: Sorry .
DENIS: Atta-girl .
MARGARET: Blot itBlot it..
JUNE: Sorry ?
DENIS: Now look what you 've done . Are they to keep the loonies out o you in ?
MARGARET: Wear your scarf . There 's a chill out there .
SUSIE: Good morning Lady Thatcher . Are you alright ? How are you feeling ?
MARGARET: I 'm fine , thank you Susie .
SUSIE: I 've just been reading about the ombings .
MARGARET: Yes . Frightful .
SUSIE: Sorry .
MARGARET: Yes , of course , dear . Today .
SUSIE: The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait . I 'll put it on the mantelpiece , and there 's an invitation from Lord Armstrong fo lunch on the first Friday of next month .
MARGARET: What are they playing ?
SUSIE: I think they said Rogers and Hammerstein .
MARGARET: Silly man .
ALFRED: Did someone cover the butter ? All look at one another in a panic .
MARGARET: I 'll go .
BEATRICE: Leave it .
ALFRED: Not just big business but small usinesses , like mine .
BEATRICE: Margaret ! BEATRICE tuts , shoving a tray in her hand .
ALFRED: We on this island are strong . We 're self-reliant . Sometimes we 're plain bloody minded .
ALFRED OOV: Open it then .
MARGARET: I 've got a place at Oxford . ALFRED bear-hugs MARGARET awkwardly .
ALFRED: Do n't let me down Margaret . The CHINK of a teacup-
MARGARET: Mother ?
BEATRICE: My hands are still damp .
DENIS: They 're talking about you again . The murmur of JUNE on the phone-
DENIS: Sun 's not quite over the yard arm . Time for tea . A phone rings , O.S .
MARGARET: What have you got on your head ?
DENIS: Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it , it 's Friday , why not fancy dress ?
MARGARET: You look ridiculous . MARGARET strains to hear-
DENIS: Bosslady no like ? She makes a shushing motion .
MARGARET: No , Denis , Bosslady no like .
DENIS VO: Oh , rumbled !
CAROL OOV: Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car .
CAROL: Hello Ma . Bloody taxi driver . Would n't take my card . I said do n't have a sticker saying you take Visa and then insist on cash . Can you believe it ? I was ummaging around the bottom of my ag . He did n't get a tip .
MARGARET: I did n't know that you were dropping by today , dear .
CAROL: Yes , you said yesterdayYou wanted to make a start on Dad 's things . The cupboards ? Then I can help you dress . MARGARET , nonplussed .
MARGARET: Jaqueline
CAROL: Coming for dinner tonight .
MARGARET: Of course . We 're having halibut . On TV , images of a bombed street ,
CAROL: Oh God . Is n't it terrible ?
DENIS: It 'll be fine . Come on , get you head down , it 's ten to three , fo God 's sake .
MARGARET: We must release a statement , offering our condolences .
CAROL: I 'm sure they 've already-
MARGARET: We must never , ever , ever give in to terrorists .
CAROL: Now ma , are we going long or just elow the knee tonight ?
MARGARET: Oh , below the knee I should think .
CAROL: I hear you went out todayYou must n't go out on your own Mummy . We 've talked about that .
MARGARET: There was no milk .
CAROL: Call Robert he 'll get it for you if June 's not up-
MARGARET: I am not for the knackers yet . From behind-
CAROL: No one is saying that .
MARGARET: If I ca n't go out to buy a pint of milk then what is the world coming to . Really Carol , please do n't fuss about it . You 've always been like this , fuss fuss fuss . You must find something better to do with your time . It 's most unattractive in a woman . When I was your age the last thing I wanted to do was fuss around my mother . Silence-
DENIS: Four down , 9 letters . DENIS withdraws into his crossword .
MARGARET: Obstinate . DENIS writes , pleased . CAROL looks up , with quiet bemusement-
CAROL: What ?
MARGARET: Pearls . I 'll wear the pearls .
CAROL: It 's nearly all familiar faces , William , Michael and his lovely wife-
MARGARET: Jacqueline . CAROL smiles , clearly reassured-
CAROL: And then there 's Peter , James R and James T and that very nice man-
MARGARET: Yes-
CAROL: - we met last year .
MARGARET: Yes I remember-
CAROL: I think he 's bringing his new lady friend just to mix it up a bit . We 're rather short on women - but I 'm sure we 'll manage-
MARGARET: I 've always preferred the company of men-
CAROL: Ma ?
MARGARET: Well I do n't like coalitions , never have
DENIS VO: Start on the outside
PORTLY HOST: Attlee has his sights set on the steel industry , you mark my words .
MALE GUEST: Yes , hold your breath , sir , that 's government property !
PORTLY HOST: So was your father a political man , too , Miss Roberts ?
MARGARET: Oh , yes , to his core . And Mayor of Grantham .
PORTLY HOST: And a grocer as well !
MARGARET: Yes .
HOSTESS: And did you help , err , in theshop ?
MARGARET: Oh , yes . It was a family business .
WAITER: Whisky . The MURMUR of conversation all around-
MARGARET: What I do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet . Yes we help people of course we help people . But for those that can do , they must just get up and do . And if something 's wrong , they should n't just whine about it , they should get in there and DO something about it , change things .
PORTLY HOST: With all due respect , Miss Roberts , what may have served in Grantham-
MARGARET: Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too .
MALE GUEST: Really ? A general sense of quiet incredulity .
MARGARET: I know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income . Just like the man or woman on the street , when I am short one week , I have to make economies the next .
MALE GUEST: I 'm not sure a home economics lesson is quite what the Dartford constituents need . They see industry being nationalized , the unions on the up , the pound on the slidewhoever can sort that lot out - he 's my man .
MARGARET: Or woman ?
HOSTESS: Ladies shall we ?
PORTLY HOST: Miss Roberts , do join the ladies .
MICHAEL: So , Margaret , how would you have dealt with this if you 'd been Prime Minister ?
MARGARET: Where ?
CAROL: The bombings , mummy . Today ? MARGARET still lost
MARGARET: No , uhm , yes - we have always lived alongside evil . But it has never been so patient , so avid fo carnage , so eager to carry innocents with it into oblivion .
MALE GUEST: So , would you -
MARGARET: Western civilization must root out this evil , wherever it hides , o she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age . Unimaginable !
PETER: The Prime Minister gave a very good statement I thought .
MARGARET: Yes . Clever man . Quite a smoothie . Laughter-
FEMALE GUEST: I heard you speak at conference in 1984 in Brighton just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel . You were remarkable . I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself .
MARGARET: It used to be about trying to do something . Now its about trying to e someone .
FEMALE GUEST: Well anyway , Ithank you .
MARGARET: Good night to you .
CAROL: OKhold on to methat 's right .
MARGARET: Can you do the clasp , I ca n't quite -
CAROL: You 've got an eyelash .
MARGARET: What does Mark think about it ?
CAROL: Mark ?
MARGARET: Yes . Tell him to come up . I want to talk to him about it . CAROL , hesitates , with concern-
CAROL: Mark 's with Sarah and the children .
MARGARET: Well tell him to come up and see me after he 's kissed them good night , would you Carol darling ?
CAROL: He 's not here Mummy .
MARGARET: You look exhausted , dear . You eally must try to get some sleep . Taxis 'll be few and far between at this hour
CAROL: Righty-ho . Night night Ma . Sleep well .
MARGARET: Good night , dear . The slam of a door . MARGARET sits , alone .
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid to win a seat in Parliament today , but she has put new life into the Dartford Conservative Association . Winning candidate Mr Dodds had bette watch out , this bright young woman is on his tail .
DENIS: Eat !
MARGARET: Disaster .
DENIS: Hang onHang onHang on
MARGARET: Not splendidly enough .
DENIS: Ah I see . Self pity . MARGARET eyes him , mid chip-
MARGARET: What game ?
DENIS: You are a grocer 's daughter-
MARGARET: -And proud of being- He grabs her hand , silencing her .
DENIS: - in their eyes . A single grocer 's daughter . But if you were to ecome the wife of a moderately successful businessman-
SILENCE: Margaret , will you marry me ? She is genuinely stunned .
MARGARET: Yes . Yes !
DENIS: What ?
MARGARET: I love you so much butI will never be one of those women Denis - who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband . Or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter .
DENIS: We 'll get a help for that .
MARGARET: No - one 's life must matter , Denis . Beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children , one 's life must mean more than that - I can not die washing up a tea cup .
DENIS: That 's why I want to marry you , my dear . She kisses him . A CHINK of a TEACUP-
MARGARET: There they are , my little twins . Mark
DENIS: Cornwall , was n't it ? Bloody hell Look at ` em , little imps . You never really got golf , did you ?
MARGARET: You look happy .
DENIS: Yes , I do , do n't I ? You 're drinking too much . MARGARET ignores him .
MARGARET: They grow up so fast .
SPEAKER VO: Mr Eric Deakins , Labour
MARGARET: There they are , my little twins . Mark
DENIS: Cornwall , was n't it ? Bloody hell Look at ` em , little imps . You never really got golf , did you ?
MARGARET: You look happy .
DENIS: Yes , I do , do n't I ? You 're drinking too much . MARGARET ignores him .
AIREY NEAVE: Mrs Thatcher ! Airey Neave . Welcome to the madhouse . Follow me . The doors swing open-
SPEAKER: The Right Honourable Lady the Secretary of State for Education .
MARGARET: The right honourable gentleman knows that we have no choice but to shut down the schools !
SHADOW MINISTER: Methinks the Right Honourable lady doth screech to much . If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down !
MARGARET: If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to WHAT I am saying , rather than HOW I am saying it , he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself !
SHADOW MINISTER: Why has this Conservative government failed ? Why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs ?
HEATH: So these power cuts will continue unless we can reach a compromise . EDWARD HEATH is in mid-flow .
MINISTER 1: Hear hear , Prime Minister .
HEATH: - the fact of the matter is , it 's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors . Yes , Education Secretary .
MARGARET: Yes
HEATH: Be patient . They 'll come back on in a minute .
ALFRED: He meant it as an insult but to me it 's a compliment . That 's why he could n't beat us , and that 's why Hitler ca n't beat us .
CAROL: I swear , it 's all gone completely out of my head . My driving instructor thinks I should pass ut I feel as if I 've hardly had any lessons . Ridiculous is n't it ? Maybe third time lucky .
MARGARET: Right . The only thing you should emember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept . And often both .
CAROL: Right-o .
MARGARET: Move over Move to your right a little bit
CAROL: But if I move to the right are n't I on the wrong side of the road ?
MARGARET: Carol !
CAROL: Well he 's in the way !
MARGARET: To the right . Move to the right !
CAROL: Hey , look at me , driving !
MARGARET: Have you been trying to make eakfast ? For Goodness sake , Denis !
DENIS: I can boil a bloody egg .
CAROL: Mummy took me for a test drive - We went absolutely everywhere . All over the place -
MARGARET: I 've decided . I 'm going to run .
DENIS: What for ?
MARGARET: I 'm going to run for Leader of the Party .
CAROL: Silly me ! CAROL storms out of the kitchen .
DENIS: Good luck !
MARGARET: What 's she on about ?
DENIS: It 's her driving test this morning !
MARGARET: Oh , right . Of course .
DENIS: Are you saying you want to be Prime Minister ?
MARGARET: What I 'm saying is that someone must force the point , say the unsayable . None of these men have the guts .
DENIS: The Prime Minister has been very loyal to you , MT .
MARGARET: But he 's weak , and he 's weakened the party . One must know when to go . You 're shaking . She reaches out .
DENIS: I can do it !
MARGARET: Goodness me ! What is the matte with everyone this morning ? A beat . He looks utterly fragile .
DENIS: I 've told you what the matter is . The business is a bit rocky at the moment and the Doctor thinks I need a rest .
MARGARET: And do you need a rest ?
DENIS: You 're insufferable , Margaret , do you know that ?
MARGARET: Denis , you married someone who is committed to public service , you knew that . And it is my duty -
DENIS: Do n't call it duty . It 's ambition which has got you this far . Ambition . And the rest of us , me , the children , we can all go to hell ! The SLAM of the door , DENIS gone-
MARGARET: Where did you go ?
DENIS: South Africa .
MARGARET: Yes .
DENIS: Too busy climbing the greasy pole
MARGARET: Oh that 's rather easy to answer , actually . They are unafraid of success .
REECE: Well erFor a start , that hat has got to go . And the pearls . In fact I think all hats may have to go . You look and sound like a privileged Conservative wife and we 've already got her vote . You 've got lovely hair but we need to do something with it - to make it more-
AIREY NEAVE: Important .
REECE: Yes . Give it more impact . But the main thing is your voice . Its too high . It has no authority .
AIREY NEAVE: Methinks the Lady doth screech too much
REECE: People do n't want to be harangued y a woman or hectored . Persuaded yes . That ` oh yes ' at the end of the interview , that 's authoritative , that 's the voice of a leader . MARGARET stares at him .
MARGARET: It 's all very well to talk about changing my voice , Mr Reece , but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would e like imagining , I do n't know , eing led into battle by thei chambermaid . It 's my background , and my sex . No matter how I 've tried , and I have tried , to fit in , I will never be truly one of them .
REECE: If I may say so - I think that 's your trump card . You 're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far . It 's really very exciting . One simply has to maximise your appeal , bring out all your qualities and make you look , and sound , like the leade that you could be .
NEAVE: You 've got it in you to go the whole distance .
REECE: Absolutely .
MARGARET: Prime Minister ? ! Oh no . Oh no no no . In Britain ? There will be no female Prime Minister here , not in my lifetime . No . And I told Airey , I do n't expect to win the leadership , but I am going to run . Just to shake up the party . NEAVE moves in intently-
NEAVE: Respectfully , Margaret , I disagree . If you want to change this party , lead it . If you want to change the country , lead it . What we 're talking about here today is surface . What 's crucial is that you hold your course , and stay true to who you are . Never be anything other than yourself . MARGARET , though flattered , looks sceptical .
REECE: Leave us to do the rest .
MARGARET: Gentlemen , I am in your hands . I may be persuaded to surrender the hat . But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins and they are absolutely non-negotiable . MARGARET smiles at them .
DENIS: Yes MT !
MARGARET: You are the backbone of ou nation ! Small firms like Loveday 's Ice Cream . How are you ? So nice to meet you ladies .
NEAVE: Give ` em hell ! He looks her up and down , with a smile .
MARGARET: Oh Airey As from the stage -
ANNOUNCER: The leader of the Conservative Party , Margaret Thatcher !
NEAVE: Good night Margaret . My money 's on the filly to win !
MARGARET: Oh , thanks Airey . Goodnight .
MARGARET: Now , as the test draws near , I ask your help . That together we can shake off the shackles of socialism and restore to greatness this country that we love so much . And the only way is for the Conservative Party to win !
DENIS: This is it , steady the buffs old girl .
MARGARET: I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust the British people placed in me today , and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility . And now , I should like to share with you a prayer of St Francis of Assisi Where there is discord may we bring harmony Where there is error may we bring truth Where there is doubt may we bring faith Where there is despai may we bring hope..
DENIS: Just let them look under the onnet , MT . Check everything is hunky dory .
MARGARET: Really it 's becoming quite tiresome .
DENIS: What is ?
MARGARET: You . I was on my own for twenty fou years before I met you and I can manage perfectly well without you now . So will you please go away and stop bothering me .
DOCTOR: Just look straight at me , straight ahead , that 's it .
MARGARET: No
DOCTOR: Hallucinations ? MARGARET hesitates . She shakes her head .
MARGARET: No .
DOCTOR: Sleep ?
MARGARET: Yes , I sleep . Four , five hours a night .
DOCTOR: So you wake early ?
MARGARET: And I stay up late . I always have .
DOCTOR: We just want to keep abreast of it .
MARGARET: Yes . Of course .
DOCTOR: Grief is a very natural state .
MARGARET: My husband has been gone fo years . Cancer .
DOCTOR: Carol says you 've decided to let his things go . Probably a good thing .
MARGARET: Yes . It was my idea . To Oxfam . Perfectly good stuff . People can use these things .
DOCTOR: Still it must be a bit disorientating . You are bound to e feeling .
MARGARET: What ? What am I ` bound to be feeling ' ?
DOCTOR: What are you thinking , Margaret ?
MARGARET: Watch your thoughts , for they ecome words . Watch your words , for they become actions . Watch your actions , for they become habits . Watch your habits , fo they become your character . And watch your character , for it ecomes your destiny . What we think , we become . My father always said that . And I think I am fine . But I do so appreciate your kind concern .
JUNE: I 'll give Carol a quick ring , let her know we 're back , then I 'll put your electric blanket on .
DENNIS OOV: Steady , steady , steady ! Damn . Fore ! The ball bounces down the wooden stairs .
DENIS: What about that medicine man , eh ? Ah . Cold supper . Standards are slipping Margaret .
MARGARET: Enough . Denis , enough !
DENIS: Dismissed !
MARGARET: June .
DENIS: June ! Bingo . Knew you 'd get there in the end . `` When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride , He shouts to scare the monster , who will often turn aside , but the she-bear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail . For the female of the species is more deadly than the male ''
MARGARET: If I ca n't hear you then I ca n't see you . And if I ca n't see you then you are not here . MARGARET closes her eyes .
BBC VOICEOVER: Baroness Thatcher made an apparently routine visit to he doctor today . Although rarely seen in public , Lady Thatcher , the longest serving Prime Minister of the twentieth century , remains a controversial figure .
JUNE: Margaret-
MARGARET: I do n't recognize myself .
FOOT VO: Less than two years ago , the Prime Minister quoted St. Francis and talked about bringing faith , hope and harmony to this country .
MARGARET: Denis ?
FOOT: Can the Right Honourable Lady deny , that having brought about the highest level of unemployment since 1934-
PROTESTORS: Maggie Maggie Maggie ! Out Out Out ! Maggie Maggie Maggie ! Out Out Out !
PROTESTOR 1: You 're supposed to be a mother ! You 're not a mother , you 're s monster ! You 're a monster !
HESELTINE: May we have a word , Prime Minister ?
MARGARET: Yes , but in order to arrive at the palace on time , Geoffrey and I are will be walking out of that doo in 15 minutes . As you can see -
HESELTINE: I know you 're running late Margaret , but we have to address this situation in light of tomorrow 's blistering press coverage . Blistering ! The knives are out . Your draft budget 's been leaked , Geoffrey , they are baying for our blood !
HOWE: Michael we ca n't possibly buckle at the first sign of difficulty . The SCRATCH of PRIOR 's hand on unkempt hair-
HESELTINE: No one is saying we have to uckle .
PRIOR: But is this really the time to make these spending cuts in the middle of one of the deepest ecessions this country has eve experienced ?
HESTLETINE: We need a plan of action , Margaret .
PYM: Absolutely . A strategy .
GILMOUR: We must be armed .
PRIOR: Agreed .
MARGARET: Really . How much is a pack of Lurpak ?
PYM: Lurpak ?
MARGARET: Butter , Francis . Forty two pence . Anchor butter is forty pence . Flora margarine , still the cheapest , is thirty eight pence . I can assure you I am not out of touch .
GILMOUR: Nothing . Nothing , Prime Minister . MARGARET is furious .
MARGARET: Do n't try to hide you opinions . Goodness me , I 'd much rather you were honest and straightforward about them - instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press . Well ?
PYM: Well , people ca n't pay thei mortgages .
GILMOUR: The manufacturing industry is practically on its knees .
PYM: Honest , hard-working , decent people are losing their homes . It 's terribly shameful .
GILMOUR: The point is , Prime Minister , that we must moderate the pace -
HESELTINE: - if we 're even to have a hope of winning the next election-
PYM: Quite right .
MARGARET: Ah . Worried about our careers , are we ?
HOWE: You ca n't close down a discussion ecause it 's not what you wish to hear .
MARGARET: I do n't expect everyone just to sit there and agree with me . But what kind of leader am I if I do n't try to get my own way - to do what I know to be right .
HOWE: Yes . But Margaret , one must be careful of testing one 's colleagues ' loyalty too far .
MARGARET: But we shall never give in to them . We shall never waver , not for a second , in our determination to see this country prosper once again .
DENIS: Come on love , get to bed . I do n't know why you do this to yourself every year , it 's a speech at conference , not the Magna Carta ! She looks up , distracted .
MARGARET: I know , I 'm coming DT . Nearly there -
DENIS: My shoes !
MARGARET: Mark ? Hello darling No , I 'm fine I 'm very well
DENIS: Boy 's always going AWOL .
MARGARET: Well it costs him a great deal to fly everyone up here .
DENIS: There you go , making excuses fo him . Now look where it 's got you .
MARGARET: Yes . He moved to Paris when he was fourteen . He played the King of Siam 4,625 times on the London and Broadway stages . What are you doing ?
DENIS: One likes to make an effort . A snifter ?
MARGARET: You 're dead , Denis .
DENIS: Ah . Well , if I 'm dead who are you talking to ? Shall we dance ?
MARGARET: Gentlemen , the Argentinian Junta - which is a fascist gang - has invaded our sovereign territory . This can not be tolerated . May I make plain my negotiating position . I will not negotiate with criminals or thugs . The Falkland islands belong to Britain , and I want them back . Gentlemen , I need you to tell me today if that is possible .
ADMIRAL LEACH: Possible just , Prime Minister . We can have a Task Force ready to sail in forty-eight hours . MARGARET is visibly stunned .
MARGARET: Forty-eight hours ?
ADMIRAL LEACH: But -
MARGARET: But ?
ADMIRAL LEACH: We have a very narrow weathe window . We ca n't fight in winte down there . Nobody can . If we are going , we have to go now .
MARGARET: Why were the islands left without any naval protection ?
JOHN NOTT: In the last round of Defence cuts we judged the risk of invasion to e small .
MARGARET: Did we ?
JOHN NOTT: And if you remember , Prime Minister , you agreed that we should reduce the naval presence in the area to an absolute minimum .
HOWE: Margaret , the cost of sending 28,000 men and a hundred ships twelve thousand miles , almost to Argentina , will be absolutely crippling .
MARGARET: I do n't think we should be worrying about money at this point , Geoffrey .
GEOFFREY HOWE: We ca n't afford to go to war .
MP 1: The U.S. Secretary of State has arrived , Prime Minister .
GENERAL HAIG: So you are proposing to go to wa over these Islands . They 're thousands of miles away , a handful of citizens , politically and economically insignificant , if you 'll excuse me -
MARGARET: Just like Hawaii , I imagine .
GENERAL HAIG: I 'm sorry ?
MARGARET: 1941 , when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour . Did America go cap in hand and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms ? Did she turn her back on her own citizens there ecause the islands were thousands of miles from mainland United States ? No , no , no ! We will stand on principle or we shall not stand at all .
GENERAL HAIG: But Margaret with all due respect when one has been to war .
MARGARET: With all due respect sir , I have done battle every single day of my life , and many men have underestimated me before . This lot seem bound to do the same but they will rue the day .
MARGARET: Is this ship a threat ?
ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE: Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles , Prime Minister . Just yesterday they launched- then aborted- an attack inside the exclusion zone . There is a risk they could try it again .
FRANCIS PYM: The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands . Can it eally be regarded as a threat ?
ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE: She 's been changing course continually . There 's a strong possibility that they 're attempting a pincer movement on our carrier group .
FRANCIS PYM: It 'll play badly internationally . We 'll be seen as aggressors .
JOHN NOTT: This will be an escalation , Prime Minister . She looks to LEACH .
LEACH: If there is to be an escalation , it 's better that we start it .
MINISTER: It is steaming away , Prime Minister .
MARGARET: Sink it .
JOHN NOTT: Prime Minister - JOHN NOTT enters .
MARGARET: I must write to them .
JOHN NOTT: Prime Minister ?
MARGARET: The families . I must write to them
PYM: I 've just been briefed by Admiral Fieldhouse .
JOHN NOTT: President Reagan and President Bellaunde of Peru have some new proposals for the peace plan -
MARGARET: The peace plan ? There will be no appeasement . This is a war . A wa they started and by God , we will finish . Shall I tell you what I 'm going to write to every single one of these families , these heartbroken families ? I am going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain for the Falklands .
MILITARY VOICE: Lieutenant Colonel Jones . Captain Wood . Captain Dench . Lieutenant Farlaine . Corporal Hardman . Corporal Sullivan . Corporal Briar . MARGARET writes to each of the families .
RADIO VO: Shortly after dark last night , ou forces executed what our Commande in Chief has called a brilliant surprise night attack .
DENIS: Thatcher , bed .
RADIO: From their new positions , ou forces can see large numbers of Argentine soldiers retreating and streaming back into Port Stanley . Our forces are moving forward to exploit their success .
MARGARET: We were faced with an act of unprovoked aggression and we esponded as we have responded in times past with unity , strength and courage , sure in the knowledge that though much is sacrificed , in the end , right will prevail ove wrong .
DENIS: GOTCHA ! Well that paid off old girl ! Your ratings soared ! From the most hated Prime Minister of all time to the nation 's darlingThe world was at you feet , and Britain was back in usiness !
NEWS READER: The Berlin Wall has fallen . The gates have opened ! The police are making no attempt to stop people as they go through .
MARGARET: I do n't agree in any measure !
GEOFFREY HOWE: But Prime Minister the question of the European single currency will come up .
MARGARET: I do n't think the country is ready for it yet .
GEOFFREY HOWE: But we can not bury our heads in the sand
NEWS JOURNALIST: - that there must be a change in that style of management . That Mrs Thatcher must listen more , and on occasion , give in .
MARGARET: There it is again ! Why not ?
MINISTER 1: Because -
MINISTER 2: Because people on the whole think that the tax is manifestly unfair .
MARGARET: Nonsense . Arrant nonsense . This is a simple proposition . In orde to live in this country , you must pay for the privilege- something , anything ! If you pay nothing , you care nothing . What do you care where you throw your rubbish ? You council estate is a mess , you town , graffiti , what do you care ? It 's not your problem , it 's somebody else 's problem- it 's the government 's problem ! YOUR problem is , some of you , is that you have n't got the courage for this fight . You have n't had to fight hard for anything . It 's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it ! Well , may I say , on ehalf of all those who HAVE had to fight their way up , we esent those slackers who take , take , take , and contribute nothing to the community !
HOWE: Here it is , Prime Minister . Of course .
MARGARET: The wording is sloppy here , and here .
HOWE: If you say so .
MARGARET: I do say so .
HOWE: It 's merely a first draft MARGARET looks down at the paperwork .
MARGARET: This is ridiculous . There are two `` T 's '' in `` committee '' !
ANGRY CROWD: Ca n't pay , wo n't pay ! Ca n't pay , wo n't pay ! Ca n't pay , wo n't pay !
PROTESTORS: Out Out Out
MARGARET: Geoffrey-
GEOFFREY: My letter of resignation . HOWE slides a letter down on her desk- MARGARET looks down at the thick envelope .
GEOFFREY HOWE: Our differences , I 'm afraid , can not be reconciled . MARGARET resumes working- HOWE waits and waits and waits-
HOWE: I have done what I believe to be ight for my party and my country . The time has come for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties with which I have myself wrestled fo perhaps too long .
TV JOURNALIST: It 's extraordinary . The rules of the Conservative Party make it possible for Conservative MP 's to depose a sitting Prime Minister .
MARGARET: I am the Prime Minister . Turning to Denis .
TREVOR MACDONALD: Tonight in Paris Mrs Thatcher is among thirty four world leaders who came together to celebrate the end of the Cold War and herald the start of a peaceful new age of East/West cooperation .
NEWS JOURNALIST: There 's a general feeling that Mrs Thatcher is going to win on the first ballot . We 're going to put it to bed tomorrow night , is how one of her campaign staff puts it .
TREVOR MACDONALD: Will she , or will she not , be in the job tomorrow ?
MARGARET: Treachery !
MINISTER 1: We will never win another election led by that woman .
MINISTER 2: We need a leader who listens .
MINISTER 3: This is n't about her , it 's about the party .
MINISTER 4: One must know when to go .
MINISTER 1: The question is , how does anyone put it to her ?
MINISTER: If you were to stand , I of course would vote for you Prime Ministe
MINISTER 2: - of course would vote for you Prime Minister but I do n't think you can win . The loyalty of my colleagues can not be counted upon .
MARGARET: It was the people who put me here -
MINISTER 3: The loyalty of my colleagues can not be counted upon .
MARGARET: - it 's up to them to tell me when to go .
DENIS: Margaret , you ca n't let them do this to you . Please , boss .
MARGARET: Oh Denis .
DENIS: Steady , MT .
MARGARET VO: All those years of taking the tough decisions , does any of it matter now ?
DENIS: It 's all been turned to mush !
MARGARET: What ?
DENIS: By these fools ! These lily-livered pinkos !
MARGARET: These inept placators .
DENIS: Very good ! These vacillators .
MARGARET: Vacillators ! Poll takers .
DENIS: Popularity seekers .
MARGARET: So busy taking the pulse of the public !
DENIS: Weak -
MARGARET: Theseweakweakweakwea.. .weakMen !
DENIS: Or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish !
MARGARET: Denis ? Denis ? And there he is by her side .
DENIS: Steady .
MARGARET: YesSteady
DENIS: Steady the buffs -
MARGARET: SteadySteady the buffs DENIS heading out .
DENIS: You 're going to be fine on you own , love . You always have been .
MARGARET: Denis ! !
CAROL OOV: Mummy-
CAROL: My God , Mum . Are you alright ? Mummy you should have called fo help , silly old sausage . Have you not even been in your bed properly ? You 've done all this ?
MARGARET: Yes , all sorted . Finished . MARGARET looks around her .
CAROL: Yes well do n't worry about all this . June and I will crack on with it .
MARGARET: I was just going to get dressed .
CAROL: Shall I call someone , see if anyone can come over and do you hair ? MARGARET looks at her warmly .
MARGARET: Oh . No , you do it . CAROL reacts , surprised but pleased .
CAROL OOV: Right , I 'm off June .
JUNE: OK. ` Bye . She stands , picking up the cup . From behind-
MARGARET: No , dear , I 'll do it .
JUNE: Carol said you might go to the House of Lords today ?
MARGARET: No no . I 'm not going anywhere .

MERRICK: Good morning . To everyone here and everyone watching on etherscreen , welcome to the community address . Today I 'm coming to you from Sector Four . Fo those of you here with sugar quotas , let me recommend the french toast . I just tried some and it 's excellent , really . But I know what everyone 's hungry fo s o let 's move on to the lottery . As always the draw will be made from ou host sector . So tell me , Sector Four - is everyone ready for The Daily Spin ?
ESTER: Do n't worry . Your time will come .

RESIDENT #2: Okay . But I get to set the can .
RESIDENT #1: Hurry it up . The shuttle 's coming .

LINCOLN: Six months ?
JONES: You do n't believe me - look it up .
LINCOLN: He got lucky , that 's all .
JONES: And do n't you wish it was you out there on The Island nature 's own clean air zone no screening , no quotas unlimited pleasure
LINCOLN: Shut up , Jonesy .
JONES: Why do n't you make me ? In the ring .
LINCOLN: You 're out of my weight-class .
JONES: Not anymore . They just got the new program in - multi-weight balancing .
LINCOLN: I 'll think about it .
JONES: C'mon , champ . A stim unit says you wo n't last three rounds .
LINCOLN: Whoooooo !
JONES: Sure you input the right weight class ?
LINCOLN: You 're just too slow , Jonesy .
JONES: You 're faster ` cause you 're lighter . Programmers they always miss something .
LINCOLN: Hey , you put up , now pay up .
BARTENDER: Jones Three-Bravo ; you got five units . Your friend , he 's got an alcohol flag .
JONES: So make it a beer and a Vita Cola .
LINCOLN: Shut up , Jonesy .

JONES: Quick . . . Give me that beer back .
CENSOR 1: Census check .

CENSOR 1: I hope nobody 's drinking off-quota .
LINCOLN: Vita Cola all the way , officer .
NUTRITION CLERK: Too bad . I got ta serve the full meal .
KLEINWORT: No , no , no . Use your own sugar quota .
LINCOLN: C'mon , Kleinwort
KLEINWORT: They 're conducting a census check . O do n't you watch the bulletins ?
LINCOLN: I know what it is . I 've just neve seen them out in this sector before .
KLEINWORT: Probably just tracking a glitch . A bad scanner or maybe an userware defect . Ethercuffs . They get damaged , you get a false read . Sometimes even a dropout .
LINCOLN: What are you saying ? They lost someone ?
KLEINWORT: Someone just is n't showing up where they should be . What do you care ?
LINCOLN: Hey , Jonesy . Remember the guy who won The Spin yesterday ? His apartment 's still showing as occupied .
JONES: What ? You think he 's still here ? The guy wins a place on The Island and you think he just decided not to go ?
LINCOLN: I do n't know . He was n't there to step up . And now there 's a census check
JONES: And now nothing . It 's probably the programmers messing up .
LINCOLN: Maybe .
JONES: A stim unit says I can prove it . Cross eference with sanitation .
SUPERVISOR: If you gentlemen are n't busy Perhaps I could get an update on sector six ?
LINCOLN: Still in the electrical phase , sir .
SUPERVISOR: Well the guys upstairs are griping about the backlog . So go over there and light some fires , will you ?
LINCOLN: I 'll take care of it .
SUPERVISOR: Are n't you forgetting something ? Or do you want to get contaminated ?
MCCORD: Sorry , chief . I ca n't let you get any closer . We got live wires over there .
LINCOLN: I said I ca n't hear you . M c C o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony .
MCCORD: He y , you get yourself contaminated , do n't come pointing the finger at me .
LINCOLN: How are you doing , Mac ?
MCCORD: You know how it is . ` Gets to the end of shift , ` crew starts draggin t h e i r feet .
LINCOLN: We l l the guys upstairs are griping about the backlog . They want to know when you 'll be ready for move in .
MCCORD: I guess if we bust our backs , we could e out of here by the end of the week .
LINCOLN: I 'll tell them two weeks .
MCCORD: Thanks , chief . I appreciate that .
LINCOLN: So . . . got any stuff on you today ?
MCCORD: What do you mean ?
LINCOLN: T h a t your shift 's almost over .
MCCORD: You mean , these things ? Well , these things ai n't good for you anyways .
LINCOLN: The y taste good .
MCCORD: That 's because we ai n't supposed to . They got rules about fraternization .
LINCOLN: What do you do when the shift 's over ?
MCCORD: M o r e of the same . They cycle us onto the disposal detail . Hump ` n dump crew .
LINCOLN: H u m p ` n dump crew ?
MCCORD: D e b r i s clearance . We hump the heavy stuff to a site on the outside .
LINCOLN: Is it as bad as they say out there ?
MCCORD: Right .
LINCOLN: But not everywhere . Not on The Island .
MCCORD: I do n't know too much about that .
LYDIA: L a d i e s and gentlemen , my name is Lydia and on behalf of our staff , I 'd like t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute .
DR. SANGER: I t takes courage to confront mortality , my friends . And I see it in each of y o u . My name is Dr. Henry Sanger and I 'm here to reward your courage .
LYDIA: T o d a y ' s group is from New Gaza Health Care . They 're with the platinum plan .
DR. SANGER: N e w Gaza . Yes , very good oncology unit .
LYDIA: This month we 're offering a special ate for new sponsors . Including a 10 % discount on the his-and-hers plan .
DR. SANGER: Yes . . . Now some of you may be thinking this commercial is staged . But these are not actors , these are past customers .
THE WASP: An d then what ? You get it in the mail ?
DR. SANGER: F o r practical reasons , delivery is handled by your healthcare p r o v i d e r .
LINCOLN: You wanted to see me ?
MERRICK: Yes . Please , take a seat .
LINCOLN: I guess not .
MERRICK: Why do you say that ?
LINCOLN: I f I 'm here .
MERRICK: I 'm not sure I deserve such a negative association . My job 's only to see that you 're happy . That everything 's okay .
LINCOLN: Right .
MERRICK: I t sounds like you do n't believe me .
LINCOLN: Why would n't I ?
MERRICK: I t ' s part of your makeup . To challenge things . To question what 's around you .
LINCOLN: Ah .
MERRICK: P e r h a p s you can utilize that facility y helping me solve a little puzzle .
LINCOLN: A r e you saying I 'm contaminated ?
MERRICK: No .
LINCOLN: The n what 's the problem ?
MERRICK: The r e are parameters , Lincoln . When someone starts straying from those parameters , we need to find out why .
LINCOLN: Why ?
MERRICK: Because you - not just you , all of ou esidents - are special . Because people like me do n't get to go to The Island .
LINCOLN: No .
MERRICK: What about your sleep pattern ? You feel you 've been sleeping properly ? Lincoln shrugs , refractory .
LINCOLN: Disrupted ?
MERRICK: R e s t l e s s , disoriented , uneasy
LINCOLN: I do n't know .
MERRICK: They 're all words in your vocabulary . I know you understand what they mean .
LINCOLN: I do n't know .
MERRICK: Do you have any difficulty staying focused ? At work , for instance ?
LINCOLN: I do n't know .
MERRICK: Do you sometimes feel agitated for no apparent reason ? Frustrated , angry
LINCOLN: That 's it .
MERRICK: An g r y ? You feel angry ?
LINCOLN: Right .
MERRICK: When exactly do you feel angry ?
LINCOLN: Now
MERRICK: I 'm going to order some tests at The Medical Center . In the meantime , I 'd like you to stay away from stimulants - protein , sugar , caffeine
LINCOLN: I already burned up my quotas .
MERRICK: But I know you can get around them .
LINCOLN: Is that it ?
MERRICK: The r e is one other thing . You have a female friend . `` Ester '' . Your file shows you 've been interacting regularly .
LINCOLN: The r e ' s no law against friendship .
MERRICK: O f course not . We encourage interaction in the hope it 'll be of mutual benefit . But given these deviations let 's just say proximity becomes an issue .
LINCOLN: I know the rules of proximity .
MERRICK: The rules of proximity apply to sexual contact , Lincoln . In this case it goes deeper than that . Ester is entering h e r second trimester . A time of change and emotional confusion . Further inter- a c t i o n might be unhealthy for you .
LINCOLN: Thank you . I feel much better now .
MERRICK: I 'm not sure you do . But I think you 'll do what 's right , Lincoln . You may not trust me . But I trust you .
LINCOLN: S o r r y I 'm late .
ESTER: I t ' s okay . I was waiting to tell you something anyway . Guess what ?
LINCOLN: I have to cancel , Ester .
ESTER: S o I 'll see you at breakfast tomorrow ?
LINCOLN: I do n't think so .
ESTER: Did I do something wrong , Lincoln ?
LINCOLN: No .
MERRICK: K a r l . . . Welcome back .
SCHEER: I forgot how much I hate the air here .
MERRICK: J u s t a histamine reflex . Your system 's eadjusting to the sterile environment .
SCHEER: I t ' s the smell I hate . Empty .
MERRICK: Yes , well I cut short your leave for a eason . I take it you 've been briefed ?
SCHEER: O n e of our lab rats is missing .
MERRICK: His name is Starkweather Two-Delta . He dropped off the ether two days ago . At first we thought it was a system error . Then we found this in a garbage chute .
SCHEER: D e l t a generation , huh ?
MERRICK: That 's right .
SCHEER: I t was a Delta the last time .
MERRICK: T h a t was entirely different . The product suffered a head injury .
SCHEER: What happened to this one ?
MERRICK: We do n't know . He just disappeared .
SCHEER: N o t easy to disappear . Unless he figured a way through the boundary .
MERRICK: He 's a code two , Karl . A low functioner .
SCHEER: I f you ask me , it 's a mistake giving them any functions at all .
MERRICK: The y do n't function mentally , they do n't function physically - you know that .
SCHEER: The n perhaps if you 're going to breed lab rats , you should breed them tame .
MERRICK: I f you bothered to read the clone laws , you 'd realize we have no choice in the matter . The virtual humanity statutes accord them a set of freedoms . All we can do is prescribe the limits . And even those are subject to regulation . Scope of knowledge , range of activity , even their speech patterns . The law equires that what is of human origin e provided with human characteristics .
SCHEER: You mean , like fallibility ?
MERRICK: The ether shows no attempts on the oundary . He 's here , Karl . But fo some reason , your men seem unable to find him . It 's your job to contain the products . I 'd like you to do it , okay ?
SCHEER: A little sensitive , are n't we ?
MERRICK: J u s t after Starkweather went missing , his sponsor placed an order . An order we ca n't fill . Damn right I 'm sensitive .
SCHEER: A l r i g h t . How much time do I have ?
MERRICK: J a m i l Starkweather . . . last week he sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in liver hemorrhage . In medical terms , we have maybe a few weeks . In legal terms , we 're already o n borrowed time An d Karl ?
SCHEER: R e v e r s e map . Crop to twelve hou segments . Then put up a sub-grid .
LINCOLN: I want some bacon .
STARKWEATHER: Please
LINCOLN: W h o are you ? What 's wrong with you ?
CENSOR: You asshole ! You hooked the wrong one !
COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER: Good morning - this is a community ulletin Following an incident in Sector Four earlier this morning , The Department of Sanitation is issuing an all-sector contamination warning
SCHEER: You want to tell me what 's going on ?
MERRICK: There 's nothing going on , Karl .
SCHEER: I 'm jaded . Not stupid .
MERRICK: What 's your point ?
SCHEER: I checked up . In the past year , three products have destabilized . All of them Deltas and there 's nothing going on ?
MERRICK: You 're jumping to conclusions .
SCHEER: Once I can overlook . Twice I can call coincidence . Three times I start giving a shit . Because if these products are defective
MERRICK: Q u a l i t y control is not your concern .
SCHEER: S o it is a quality control issue ?
MERRICK: That 's not what I said .
SCHEER: He was in the subway tunnels for two days . In the dark , no food , no water . His fingers were scraped to the bone . He was trying to dig his way out . Now you try to explain to me why that is .
MERRICK: It 's not an exact science - biogenesis . There 's a degree of trial and error . If the agnate does n't come together on the first pass , we have to abort and start over . It 's like breaking inertia . The ioreactor , the growth medium - we just keep upping the levels till we achieve integration . At which stage the agnate is deemed physically stable . We rely on foundation to provide mental stability - matching the templates to their capacity ut walling it in with parameters . When signs of instability started to show up , it pointed to foundation . A hole in the wall , an oversight . But it was only happening in the later generat- ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis .
SCHEER: So there was a production defect .
MERRICK: Actually the opposite . We found out in the later generations , the levels were so high that when we broke inertia , the process kept going . Over-integrating . Specifically the neural system . It produced a condition called synesthesia .
SCHEER: Synesthesia
MERRICK: A fusion of the senses , creating a component awareness . Sixth sense , s e c o n d sight , whatever you want to call it . Its emergence seems to be arbitrary . But it gives them experiences beyond their functional parameters . And ultimately it destabilizes them . However , if we catch it early enough we can control it with re-conditioning .
SCHEER: Poetic .
MERRICK: Poetic ?
SCHEER: This `` agnate '' took off just before his sponsor placed an order . Maybe he got the sense his days were numbered
MERRICK: This stays between you and me , Karl . I trust I can rely on your cooperation ?
SCHEER: Do n't you mean my complicity ?
MERRICK: Remind me , why is it you were discharged from the military ?
SCHEER: What 's your point ?
MERRICK: Learn to be a team player , Karl . O you 'll find yourself out of anothe job .
SCHEER: Nobody else would take it .
THE DOCTOR: We have to run a few tests on her first . In the meantime , I 'm going to give you something to help you relax , okay ?
THE COURIER: That 's right . Starkweather .
DESK NURSE: Still showing in surgery . Sorry .
THE COURIER: Honey , I got a bird on the pad and a storm moving in . How long 's it gon na be ?
THE SURGEON: Well he 's going to have to wait a while . It took forever to put this one under .
SURGEON: What is it ?
SURGICAL TECH: Subject 's heart rate is spiking .
SURGEON: Not again . Boost the anaesthetic lev
ESTER: Accept .
LINCOLN: Jonesy . . .
JONES: Hey , champ . Are you alright ? I heard there was a contamination scare .
LINCOLN: I saw what happened to him .
JONES: What are you talking about ?
LINCOLN: Starkweather . . . What they did to him .
JONES: You caught that fucking p a t h o g e n , did n't you ? You 're contaminated .
LINCOLN: J o n e s y , listen to me
ESTER: Please . . . do n't come any closer . I do n't want to get contaminated .
LINCOLN: Ester , I 'm not contaminated .
ESTER: But they said
LINCOLN: I 'm not contaminated !
ESTER: What do you mean ?
LINCOLN: I saw it . Why they keep us here . To use us . To take things from us .
ESTER: You 're not making sense .
LINCOLN: Your baby they 're going to take your baby away you understand ?
ESTER: M y baby ? Why would they do that ?
LINCOLN: I do n't know ! But I saw it !
ESTER: You 're scaring me , Lincoln I want to go back now .
LINCOLN: You ca n't go back ! Do n't you get it ?
ESTER: Do n't hurt him !
LINCOLN: RUN ! ! !
SCHEER: Somebody get someone down here !
LINCOLN: Ester ! Come on !
CENSOR: Nothing , sir . No sign .
SCHEER: They ca n't have got past this level .
CENSOR: A bird ? ! In this storm ? !
SCHEER: The y got out ! They got past the gate !
LINCOLN: Ester ! We have to keep going !
ESTER: W h e r e did all the green go ?
LINCOLN: The r e is no green . The windows in there they were just pictures .
SCHEER: Anything ?
LINCOLN: I think I 've found a path .
CROWNE: Good morning , gentlemen .
SANGER: Bernard , this is Ellen Crowne from ou legal department . Ellen , this is Bernard Merrick , director of products .
MERRICK: Thank you for coming out here .
CROWNE: Well when Henry called me I got the sense it was n't for a social visit .
MERRICK: First , let me stress there 's no way we could have anticipated what happened
CROWNE: We 're on the same team , Mr. Merrick . Just give me the facts down-and-dirty .
MERRICK: We ' v e lost two of our products . They escaped containment last night .
CROWNE: How exactly did this happen ?
MERRICK: We ' r e still piecing it together .
CROWNE: Do we expect more products to escape ?
DR. SANGER: Do n't be so alarmist , Ellen .
CROWNE: I 'm sorry , Henry , but you asked me here to assess our liabilities .
MERRICK: To answer your question , we condition our products with a deterrent . A fear of contamination . And thereby of the oute environment . So to escape , they first have to escape their conditioning .
CROWNE: Containment is one of the terms of ou state health license . The fact it was compromised could put us in violation .
DR. SANGER: Bureaucracy .
CROWNE: Henry , it was a bloody battle getting our license through in the first place .
DR. SANGER: They 're not going to pull our license , Ellen . We have a lot of friends on the Commission . Not to mention the goodwill we earned in DC when we took over the facility ; a bunker complex for a bio- chemical war that never happened We elieved them of a costly embarrassment .
CROWNE: I 'm not sure we can rely on that .
DR. SANGER: Alright . What do you suggest ?
CROWNE: First , I need you to level with me . What are our chances of finding them ?
MERRICK: Well , in our favor , they 've never been outside containment . They 'd have no coordinates , no sense of direction .
CROWNE: I do n't see how that 's in our favor .
MERRICK: They 're in the middle of the desert . Food and water become an issue .
CROWNE: So they might return to the trough ?
MERRICK: Possibly .
CROWNE: And if not ? How long could they last ?
MERRICK: A few days maybe . But there is anothe variable . We maintain the products in a sterile environment . So basically thei immune systems are untested . Toxins , pathogens , environmentals t h e rest of us overcome routinely , to them
DR. SANGER: That 's a little drastic . Some immune systems are more adaptive than others .
CROWNE: Let 's take the drastic case . What then ?
MERRICK: Well . . . the male , we could cover . Fast- track another generation before the sponsor ever needed access . The female comes under the maternity plan . She 's three months pregnant . Even if we fast- tracked another generation , we could n't fast-track the pregnancy . We 'd miss the delivery date , the sponsor would wonde why and there would be difficulties .
DR. SANGER: Even so , the worst may not happen .
CROWNE: We have n't even touched on the worst . If these products reach a populated area , there 's the problem of scrutiny .
DR. SANGER: Ellen , we operate under State license on a lease from the Federal Government
CROWNE: We slipped through a loophole in the clone laws , Henry . And they only let u s through because they smelt money . And they gave us a government basement to cover their own a s s e s not ours . It 's at the core of our license - why we screen potential sponsors , why we make them sign discretion agreements , why containment is such a critical factor - to limit the extent of public scrutiny .
DR. SANGER: E i t h e r way , it 's unlikely they 'd get that far . It 's at least twenty miles to the next settlement . Right , Bernard ?
CROWNE: Something to add , Mr. Merrick ?
MERRICK: I just do n't think we should under- estimate them . Especially the male .
DR. SANGER: And I do n't think we should panic .
CROWNE: Gentlemen , whatever happens we need t o keep one thing clearly in mind . As far as the world at large goes , we are just another medical services company . Anything that alters that perception puts us at risk . And we can not rely on the sanction of the law to protect us . Whenever and wherever and in whateve condition we recover these products , we have to stay beyond reproach . All it takes is one nudge to put us in the spotlight . Then you 'll see how fast politicians can run for cover .
DR. SANGER: I n other words we need to find them o r else . That 's very astute , Ellen .
OZZIE: Hello ?
LINCOLN: My friend she needs water .
OZZIE: Got stuck in that supercell , didya ?
LINCOLN: Away .
OZZIE: A w a y ? You mean , like outta s t a t e ?
LINCOLN: `` O u t of state ''
OZZIE: N o w where 's my manners gone ? I 'm Ozzie . Osmund r e a l l y . But folks call me Ozzie .
LINCOLN: I 'm going to check on my friend .
OZZIE: Nuthin . I was n't doin nuthin .
LINCOLN: `` O u t of state '' - how do I get there ?
MERRICK: Bad news .
SCHEER: Which one of you is Diggs ?
DIGGS: ` Pursuit last week . The guy took a swing at him with a fireaxe . Did n't stop Burdie though . ` Took down that fucker with one arm , did n't you ?
SCHEER: You do n't look like bounty hunters .
DIGGS: Well we 're on the job , see ? And it kind of helps if you bleed in . You do n't look like a bondman either .
SCHEER: I 'm just an intermediary .
DIGGS: Now that 's what people use when they do n't want to get their hands dirty .
SCHEER: I was told you also handled civil onds . Debt runners , data-thieves
DIGGS: What we hunt depends on the bounty .
SCHEER: It 's worth ten platinum . Unmarked .
DIGGS: What 's the bond ?
SCHEER: The parties I represent want to limit the specific details . But let 's just say industrial secrets are involved .
DIGGS: Ten platinum . Must be big secrets .
SCHEER: Any good at keeping them ?
DIGGS: Oh , me and Burdie , we 're busy bees . We do n't have time to file every report and we got real bad memories . But just so we understand each other , slick , we 're talking about a bag job , right ?
SCHEER: All I 'm authorized to tell you is they have no records in this state . Also that they 're not armed or dangerous .
DIGGS: How about we start with their names ?
SCHEER: John and Jane Doe
DIGGS: You 're kidding me , right ? No names ?
SCHEER: Because you wo n't have to look . They jumped an overnight shuttle . They 'll be headed for the terminal , trying to get out of state . It 's strictly a recovery job . For you , it should be childsplay .
DIGGS: The n why not do it yourself ? Or is the dog ring just to impress the ladies ?
SCHEER: The parties I represent want to stay at arm 's length . And just so we understand each other that means no connection , no papertrail , no police interest
DIGGS: Is that everything ?
SCHEER: . . . no mistakes . They want these two ought in quickly and quietly and unharmed . Once you have them , you 'll contact me for further instructions .
DIGGS: I do n't know . What do you say , Burdie ?
BURDON: F r a n k Hofstetter ! This is a bond ecovery ! Step away from the bar !
DIGGS: Do n't bother . He 'll drop by himself .
TICKET COLLECTOR: Tickets
LINCOLN: I t ' s going to be okay , Ester .
ESTER: Is it ?
LINCOLN: We just need to get out of state .
ESTER: I 'm hungry .
LINCOLN: O k a y . Okay

DIGGS: J u s t wanted to help , that 's all .
BURDON: You folks need a ride ?
DIGGS: Why the fuck d i d n ' t you go after them ? !
LINCOLN: We have to keep going .
LINCOLN: T h o s e men - that 's what they want too .
BURDON: We go back to the office and run ` em .
DIGGS: A s what ? John and Jane Doe ?
BURDON: We ask the guy .
DIGGS: Y e a h , let 's tell him we could n't hack it in kindergarten . See how long him and his ten platinum stick around .
BURDON: I t was blue , right ?
DIGGS: What ?
BURDON: The y were using a blue currency card .
THE SNAKE: H i there ! I 'm Tattletail ! What e v e r you want to know , wherever you want to go , I got the answers ! Let 's look at the menu !

THE SNAKE: O k a y ! Let me open that directory fo you ! I 'll be with you in two shakes !
DIGGS: J a n e e n , where the fuck have you been ?
LINCOLN: I want to get out of state . Now .
DIGGS: We got a positive on the serial number . Punch in and pull up the transactions . Start with the last hour and work back .
JANEEN: G r e a t . So I got to park my ass in front of a screen all night ?
DIGGS: I t ' s a platinum bond , Janeen . We get this , I 'll buy you a new ass , okay ?
ESTER: Lincoln , what is that ? On your face ?
LINCOLN: A r e you alright ?

LINCOLN: We ' l l keep going till we get there .
ESTER: The Island You mean , The Island ?
LINCOLN: N o w I 'm going to get some water . But I want you to stay here . It 'll be safer .
ESTER: Do n't go yet . Stay with me , Lincoln . Stay with me for a little while .
DIGGS: Punch into the currency stream , close the net on downtown and keep the search active . The next time they use the card , I want to be right on top of them
LINCOLN: The man , the man up there . Who is he ?
PEDESTRIAN: What planet ` you been living on ? That 's the Juggernaut , brother .
LINCOLN: The juggernaut
PEDESTRIAN: Jamil `` The Juggernaut '' Starkweather - highest rushing total in the league . ` Least till that injury blew out his gut . Now the doctors are saying he 'll e back on his feet next season . Those fuckers sure can work miracles , huh ?

ESTER: L o o k at this
TOM: Oh , Jesus
LINCOLN: Who are you ?
TOM: The y said I 'd never have to see you .
LINCOLN: Who ?
TOM: The people
LINCOLN: What people ?
TOM: Look , if you do n't get out of here ight now , I 'm calling security
LINCOLN: I want to know
TOM: One of the partners at my firm he told me about it . Gave me a referral . I thought he was joking at first . I went out there , took the sales tour . Even before that I knew it was n't a joke . There was this discretion agree- ment . I never saw anything like it and I 've seen a lot . Ironclad breathe a word and they 've got you by the balls . I do n't know There 's cancer in my family . Maybe it was just to keep up . All the partners were on the policy .
LINCOLN: The policy ?
TOM: Christ , you have no idea , do you ?
LINCOLN: About what ?
TOM: I ca n't fucking do this
LINCOLN: What are you talking about ?
TOM: Insurance . You 're an insurance policy .
LINCOLN: What is that ?
TOM: Health insurance medical
LINCOLN: What does that mean ?
TOM: If I get sick if part of me gets sick I take a healthy part from you .
LINCOLN: Why ?
TOM: How do you expect me to answer that ? It 's just how it works , that 's all .
LINCOLN: Why do I look like you ?
TOM: Because you are me . . .
LINCOLN: I do n't understand .
TOM: Because they made you from my cells
LINCOLN: Made me ?
TOM: That 's right . You were made . Cooked up in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled egg . Every thought running through you head , every word coming out of you mouth , all of it , manufactured , made
LINCOLN: You . . . you 're the one who made me ?
TOM: No .
LINCOLN: Who made me ?
TOM: I signed a contract . I can show you .
LINCOLN: There are men out there , looking fo us . I want you to make them stop .
TOM: I ca n't
LINCOLN: Do you have transport ?
TOM: Transport , yes yes , parked downstairs Bay 53 Take it
LINCOLN: And then you 'll call security ?
TOM: I 'm not going to call security . I 'm not going to call anybody , okay ?
ESTER: Lincoln ! No !
LINCOLN: Auto
ESTER: The man back there who looked like you does it mean I have someone too ?
SECRETARY: I just thought I should warn you . I have a sponsor holding . His name 's Thomas Lincoln . He sounded angry .
ESTER: He has marks on his face like us .
LINCOLN: I was looking for water .
GREY DOVE: Not the best place to look .
LINCOLN: My transport it stopped working .
GREY DOVE: I see . And where were you going ?
LINCOLN: Out of state
GREY DOVE: It is a sacred place . My people come here to commune with their spirits .
LINCOLN: A r e you alright ?
ESTER: I feel better after I sleep .
LINCOLN: The man out there he said everything has a spirit every living thing but not
DIGGS: I got thermals .
ESTER: I can make it .
LINCOLN: Do n't worry . The one we want goes the other way . He said it goes slower .
DIGGS: Up there in the rocks . Three o'clock . I 'm not sure it could be ambient .
BURDON: Help me ! HELP MEEEEE !
DIGGS: Burdie ?
LINCOLN: Ester ! Stop ! It 's no use !
ESTER: We have to get to The Island
LINCOLN: It 's going too fast !
ESTER: We have to get to
KATHERINE: O h , God Oh , my God
CROWNE: I take it you 've heard the news .
DR. SANGER: The bond agents . Yes . Unfortunate .
CROWNE: Unfortunate ? We 're way past unfortunate , Henry .
DR. SANGER: I thought we 'd covered ourselves .
CROWNE: The police wo n't connect the bond agents to us . But that 's not the problem . It 's the sponsor .
DR. SANGER: What are you talking about ?
MERRICK: The male agnate tracked him down .
CROWNE: His name 's Thomas Lincoln . It seems they had a genetic reunion . Not a h a p p y one . It was all I could do to stop him going to the authorities .
DR. SANGER: I still do n't see the problem .
CROWNE: He may not want a police involvement ut he 's already threatened to file suit . And he 's one of the biggest litigation attorneys in the city .
DR. SANGER: That 's why we have you , Ellen .
CROWNE: That 's why I asked Bernard to come out here . To find out how it happened .
MERRICK: I told her , Henry . About synesthesia .
DR. SANGER: I t was a marginal problem . And it was under control - according to Bernard .
CROWNE: That 's not the point . Whether or not it 's a factor in this instance , it puts us in breach of the clone laws .
DR. SANGER: I t does n't even touch their genetics .
CROWNE: I 'm talking about self-awareness . The virtual humanity statutes require us t o give them consciousness to the l e v e l of functionality . But not beyond .
DR. SANGER: I 've spent my entire career facing down naysayers , Ellen . Do n't think for a second I 'm afraid of facing them now .
CROWNE: You remember cryogenics ? At the outset , people dismissed it as a rich man 's folly . Eccentric millionaires freezing their brains , hoping to wake up in a new ody .
DR. SANGER: A l r i g h t . What do you suggest ?
CROWNE: O u r security chief - I 've been looking at his file . Ex-marine , served in South China - do we think he still has it in him ?
DR. SANGER: A r e you insane ?
CROWNE: ` You ever wondered why Henry takes those pills , Bernard ? Why he does n't avail himself of his own technology ?
DR. SANGER: An agnate could give me a new heart ut to get it to function mentally
CROWNE: B u l l s h i t , Henry . Bullshit . You do n't want to deal with reality . Only with concept . I may not have been there at the start but I heard the stories . You wanted in on every aspect of construction , from environmental design right down to the classical playlists . I t was n't enough just to make it work , was it ? No , you wanted your own little utopia .
DR. SANGER: A r e you quite finished ?
CROWNE: E v e n God has blood on his hands , Henry . Are you going to watch it all go up in flames or are you going to deal with it ?
DR. SANGER: You see that street down there ? Running east from the stadium . My father used to take me to church on that street . An old Spanish church .
CROWNE: What 's your point ?
DR. SANGER: I did n't know they 'd torn it down .
LINCOLN: What did you give her ?
KATHERINE: J u s t something to help her sleep . I think she has a bronchial infection . But I 'm not sure I should give her an antibiotic in case it effects the baby .
LINCOLN: S o you know about the baby
KATHERINE: Is n ' t that why you came here ?
LINCOLN: I found your name in the listings . I was n't sure . You do n't look like her .
KATHERINE: The y have a plan For women like me .
LINCOLN: S o you 're the one who takes her baby .
KATHERINE: You know when you 're young ? How you un around thinking you 're immortal ?
SCHEER: I told you we should n't have gone to outside personnel . They were cowboys .
MERRICK: We had no choice , Karl . We had to keep this away from The Institute .
SCHEER: An d now ?
MERRICK: Your resignation papers . Maybe ` early etirement ' would be more accurate S c h e e r leans forward , frowning , curious .
SCHEER: A parachute So there 's a jump ?
MERRICK: You understand that whatever happens , The Institute must be able to deny it .
SCHEER: You want to dispose of your products .
MERRICK: I t ' s a little more complicated than that . We have to be very thorough . If you still have it in you , that is .
SCHEER: Why do you think I still wear this ?
MERRICK: I do n't know .
SCHEER: I was discharged from the marines fo insubordination . If you asked anyone i n my unit , they 'd call it heroism . I disobeyed an order to fall back . I took out a bunker complex single-handed .
MERRICK: S o you wear it is a badge of honor ?
SCHEER: N o . It was n't bravery . I was n't afraid of dying . I just did n't care . You see , I suddenly realized I was just a sack of flesh with a heartbeat . Life , death , I just could n't see the point anymore . Merrick allows a respectful pause , then-
MERRICK: You 'll find a vehicle parked outside . It 's unregistered , difficult to trace . I take it we have an agreement ?
KATHERINE: What do I call you ?
LINCOLN: Lincoln . My name 's Lincoln .
KATHERINE: Lincoln , I think she needs professional help . I think she needs to see a doctor .
LINCOLN: N o . They 'll find her . They 'll take her .
KATHERINE: N o t if I do n't want them to .
LINCOLN: You do n't understand . They do n't want people to know about her . Either of us .
KATHERINE: The doctor I 'm thinking of , he 's an old friend . He look after John in t h e final stages . I trust him .
LINCOLN: Why ? So you can take her baby ?
KATHERINE: N o . No , that 's not what I want .
LINCOLN: The y make you believe there 's a place called The Island . Then they take you upstairs and put you to sleep . They cut you open . They take pieces of you .
KATHERINE: E v e n if I had taken her baby , I swea to you , I 'd never have They give you a choice , you see , to extend the sponsorship after after d e l i v e r y .
LINCOLN: N o . I saw a lot of us go to The Island . But I never saw anyone come back .
KATHERINE: You mean Even if I had extended the sponsorship , they 'd have and kept taking the money ? But that 's inhuman .
LINCOLN: Is it ? I would n't know .
TOM: Yes ?
SCHEER: I 'm from the Sanger Institute .
TOM: I 've given you people enough of my time already .
SCHEER: I t ' s just a formality . I need to see your sponsorship contract .
TOM: Why would I make copies ? Do you think I want anyone else to know about this ?
KATHERINE: We l l I 've been keeping busy . Trying to . Thanks for coming down to meet me .
LINCOLN: C a n you help her ?
KATHERINE: He means that by trying to help her , we could lose her . Or lose the baby .
LINCOLN: He l l o , stranger .
ESTER: You look tired , Lincoln .
LINCOLN: Ester
ESTER: I t ' s okay . I know . Katherine told me .
LINCOLN: What do you mean ?
ESTER: F r o m this From having a baby .
LINCOLN: I know .
KATHERINE: What are you talking about ?
LINCOLN: He 's come for her . For us .
SCHEER: I 'm jealous of you . You have a reason to live . I ca n't say I 've ever had that
CROWNE: M r s . Ester ? My name is Ellen Crowne .
DR. SANGER: M y name is Henry Sanger . I 'd like to offer my deepest condolences .
MERRICK: An d it 's a terrible loss .
CROWNE: L e g a l issues must seem trivial at this time . But the sponsorship agreement has certain conditions relating to confident-
KATHERINE: I see .
CROWNE: T h a t said , The Institute is likewise ound by the terms of sponsorship and while we reserve every right
KATHERINE: You can stop there . I know why I 'm here . You wanted to know if I 'm going to sue you for breach of contract .
DR. SANGER: N o t h i n g so devious , Mrs. Ester . We simply wanted to find some way to heal the wounds from this incident .
KATHERINE: I do n't want restitution , Dr. Sanger . The reason I agreed to this meeting was to have the chance to talk to you .
DR. SANGER: O f course . Please
KATHERINE: I never got to meet you when I visited The Institute . It was one of your sales- m e n who led the tour . I remember how h e described the agnates a s if they were some kind of mindless organisms . More like livestock than humanity
CROWNE: L e g a l l y , human rights do n't apply .
DR. SANGER: Do n't interrupt , Ellen .
KATHERINE: I remember how eager I was to believe him . But when I saw w h a t I 'd created , in flesh and blood , when I touched h e r , it was I who felt less than human .
DR. SANGER: I understand .
KATHERINE: Ester ' s life was my responsibility and her death is my cross to bear alone . So I 'm not going to sue you , Dr. Sanger But I am going to blame y o u . Until the day I die , I will silently curse you name . That 's w h a t I wanted you to know .
CROWNE: We do have other issues to discuss
DR. SANGER: N o , Ellen , that 's enough . I think Mrs. Ester has said all there is to say .
KATHERINE: I do n't think they suspected anything .
CROWNE: We l l , I do n't know about the two of you but I 'd say we got off lightly .
DR. SANGER: Did we ?
CROWNE: Do n't start getting maudlin , Henry . It 's a little too late in the game .
LYDIA: L a d i e s and gentlemen , my name is Lydia and on behalf of our staff , I 'd like t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute . Before we start the tour , we 'll be serv-
LINCOLN: I ca n't find my sunglasses . I think I left them on the shuttle .
LYDIA: We l l we 're about to start the tour . But I can have someone check for you .
LINCOLN: Do n't worry . I 'll catch up .
DR. SANGER: C a s e in point , the clone . Back in the eginning , the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic landmark- to break the curse of heredity , to correct congenital defect genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science . A bright future that led to a dark age and much of
LYDIA: DR. SANGER ?
CENSOR: S i r , I 've been trying to contact you . It 's the ether Something 's wrong .
MERRICK: E t h e r c o n ! Ether control , come in !
CENSOR: That 's what I mean . We ca n't get through . The circuits are locked .
MERRICK: How wide is this going ?
LINCOLN: I t ' s been a year since the breakout . A year in hiding , waiting for things to quiet down . I do n't know how many made i t out or how many who did , survived . I know there are people called politicians trying to say it never happened . That 's why I 've kept this journal . To keep the truth alive . Alive I 've learned what that means but it still confuses me . In functional terms , I 've been alive for ten years . In human terms , more than thirty . Human I 'm not sure about that one either . They say I 'm not human because I have no mother or father . I guess I have more to learn . But one word I do understand is hope . So maybe this j o u r n a l will give hope - to those like me , who may be out there . To know t h e y ' r e not alone . My name is Lincoln S i x - E c h o and this is my testament
ESTER: I t ' s the name of his father .
LINCOLN: We should finish packing .
KATHERINE: Yes . There are people sympathetic to the cause . I 'm going to get it to them .
LINCOLN: Thank you , Katherine . For everything .
KATHERINE: Do n't forget that . It has the operating manuals for the boat .
LINCOLN: I 've been looking at them for months .
KATHERINE: But the maps , the charts
LINCOLN: I do n't need them either .

LEROY: People need to eat . Now open the gate . Mike opens the gate .
MIKE: How would you feel if you were one of them ?
LEROY: Humans are n't raised to be food .
MIKE: Everyday , watching them stupidly walk into that killing pen . This is n't a normal kid 's life . You wo n't even let me go to school .
LEROY: Now why would you want to be in public school with the rest of those people down below , in Derry ?
MIKE: Because I want to be in boring classes with other boring kids and draw pictures in text books and play baseball and go to dances and grind .
LEROY: I know , son . I get it . But you are n't like those people . We may work with sheep , but those people are sheep . Trust me . The last point Leroy believes in like gospel .

MRS. MARSH: Darling , sometimes I look at myself in the morning and think the same thing .
OFFICER BOWERS: Leroy Hanlon ?

OFFICER BOWERS: Police business .
LEROY: We need a lawyer ?
MIKE: Dad , it's-

OFFICER BOWERS: Call an ambulance .
RICHIE: Whoa , what 's with the history project , Benny-boy ?
BEN: Oh , uh , when I first moved here I did n't have anyone to play with o anything , so I just started hanging out in the Library .
STAN: Why is it all , like , people getting killed and missing kids and stuff ?
BEN: I do n't know . There 's just a lot of that here . Been that way since the original settlers .
WILL: You have a copy of the Town Charter . Seriously ?
BEN: Derry started as a logging camp efore it was officially on any maps . 300 people signed the charter that made Derry Derry . A month later they all disappeared , without a trace .
RICHIE: The entire town ? Eddie is freaked out by this revelation .
BEN: The people , the livestock , everything that was alive .
TO STAN: Are n't you supposed to be Jewish ?
BEN: People in neighboring settlements thought it was Indians or something ut there was no sign of an attack . The only clue was a well house that was burnt down to charcoal .
RICHIE: Shit , maybe we could get Derry on Unsolved Mysteries !
BEN: It was here . Right on the corne of what 's now Witcham and Jackson .
EDDIE: Hey , is n't that where Will 's other , Georgie-
WILL: Yeah , it 's where Georgie died .

EDDIE: Screw that .
BEN: I 'll go .
EDDIE: Ben , with those cuts you have on your chest , I 'm not sure if getting in this water-
RICHIE: Will you stop with the grey wate shit . You make it seem like any water we get in is like swimming in an out-house .
BEN: What 's grey water ?
STAN: Do n't get him started .
WILL: I 'll go first .
RICHIE: What are you waiting for ? Why do n't you get in you pussy ?
BEN: Very funny , Richie .
RICHIE: I thought so .
WILL: Do you guys ever feel there 's something wrong with Derry . Like it 's , I do n't know , haunted o something ?

BEN: You mean how all sorts of disasters and disappearances and stuff keeps on happening here ?

STAN: Like any town , right ? That 's been around long enough , bad stuff is ound to happen . I mean , have you ead the Torah ? Richie , turns over to work on his back .
RICHIE: Boys , you 're ruining my sunbathing vibes with all this chitte chatter .

RICHIE: We already know you 're crazy , Will . No judgement here .
WILL: I saw Georgie last night . Only . It was n't him .
EDDIE: Like . In your dreams ?
WILL: No . In my house , he tried to get me to go into the basement with him .
RICHIE: That was n't Georgie , that was you neighborhood sex offender making a house call .
WILL: Shut up Richie . It was n't just him . I saw this other I do n't know .
STAN: What did you see Will ?
BEN: The clown ? Will , Stan and Eddie look at Ben .

STAN: I saw something , too . In the asement of the synogogue .
RICHIE: I take it back . I 'm judging all of you and you are all friggin ' wackos .
BEVERLY: I need to show you guys something .
BEN: Is n't he at work ?
BEVERLY: Sometimes he comes home for a nap .
WILL: We should leave lookouts . Ben , Stan , can you ?
STAN: What does he look like ?
BEVERLY: My Daddy ? Mean . Like a drunk . Will , Richie and Eddie go with Bev .
RICHIE: Can you give me an indicator of what I 'm about to walk into ?
BEVERLY: You 'll see .
RICHIE: I hope it 's Ed McMahon and I 've just won publishers clearing house 10 million dollar sweepstakes . But if it is , you really did n't have to go through so much trouble , you could have just brought Ed to the quarry .
EDDIE: Oh God . Oh God .
BEVERLY: You really see it ?
RICHIE: It 's like someone slaughtered a pig in here . Or a parent . Richie is slack jawed .
WILL: What happened ? Bev is so relieved she almost cries .
BEVERLY: The sink . It came out from the sink . My parents could n't see it . I thought I was going crazy .
WILL: You okay , Eddie ? Eddie Kaspbrack ?
STAN: What 's taking them so long ?
EDDIE: There was a lot of blood .
RICHIE: All I 'm saying is maybe there 's some weirdo going around Derry dressed as a clown . You know , like the Joker in a `` Dark Knight '' comic . Some whack job who likes to dress up and kidnap kids .
WILL: Okay , so how did he put Georgie in my basement ?
BEVERLY: Or blood in my sink ?

BEN: A clown .
STAN: Or sometimes it 's something else .
EDDIE: Only us kids can see it .
BORTON: Okay , stop . Is this you Tozier ? Did you put them up to this little practical joke .
WILL: No , we all saw it .
OFFICER BOWERS: Such wild imaginations . Too bad we ca n't bottle their little brains . Dry them out and grind them into powder to salt our food . Maybe then we 'd see , what was it again ? Borton 's exhausted . He 's having none of it .
CHIEF BORTON: You youngsters realize there 's a penalty in Derry for filing a false police report . I do n't want to have to call your parents , now .
BEVERLY: But we 're not lying .
CHIEF BORTON: You have any evidence ? The kids all look at each other , stymied .
BEN: But you adults are n't doing anything !

MIKE: I 'll try .
LEROY: You do or you do n't do . No try .
MIKE: It 's my fault .
LEROY: Stop that , Mike . There 's no one to lame here . It 's nature taking its course .
MIKE: You 're coming home though , right ?
LEROY: Pull up that seat .
MIKE: In case of what ?
LEROY: When I was about your age . Me and my buddies would go to this place along the canal
MIKE: Dad , I 'm responsible . You do n't need to tell me some long tale about drinking and driving or safe sex . I 'll take care of things-
LEROY: I 'm . Not . Done . Leroy groans through his teeth .
MIKE: Dad ?
LEROY: Shut up and listen to me . There was one night , 1960 . I remembe ecause it was August and Chubby Checker just dropped `` the twist '' .
MIKE: What truth ?
LEROY: I saw something , Mikey . Through the smoke and the burning . Something I ca n't even really explain , but it was there , Dickie saw it , too .
MIKE: What did you see ? A NURSE walks in with a chemo bag .
NURSE: Mr. Hanlon , you ready ?
LEROY: I saw what was really responsible for that fire , Mikey . Not the Legion . See those white boys , they were there , but there was something else , orchestrating ` em . Had ` em all in a fit and frenzy , moved to his whims . This thing , I do n't even know how to describe it
NURSE: Mr. Hanlon ?
LEROY: ( he grabs Mike 's shirt
VIOLENTLY: Be careful out there son . Especially by the canal . The wate in Derry is no place for no one , especially a youngster like you .
NURSE: You might want to wait outside .
MIKE: Somebody ! HELP ! Let me out !

BEVERLY: Nice stick , Richie . How about this .
WILL: Think that could take `` IT '' down ?
RICHIE: What ?
EDDIE: `` IT . ''
BEVERLY: I think it depends .
EDDIE: On what ?
WILL: What we 're scared of . It was Georgie 's corpse for me cuz , cuz that 's what I care about . It was a naked woman for Stan because he 's so afraid of-
RICHIE: Getting laiiiid .

BEVERLY: Adults just ignore them . But kids , like your brother , Georgie
WILL: They want to get closer . See thei tricks .
RICHIE: Home school .

TO MAN: Have you seen my baby , Claude ? He 's been gone near Claude ignores the woman
FLOYD CALDERWOOD: You sitting in Claude ? Floyd reaches out to grab his hand when
EDDIE KING: Please Claude , I just got married last month .
BEN: And that is the story of the Silve Dollar Saloon . They look horrified .
RICHIE: The point of telling us was ? Ben looks at Will .
MIKE: Just like my pa was trying to warn me the night I met you guys .
BEN: That clown , whatever `` IT '' is , has een around Derry doing nasty things for a long long time . The Black Spot fire . The Bradley Gang massacre . All the way back to the first settlers who disappeared .
RICHIE: Whatevs . It sounds like bunk to me . Did n't the guy who wrote this go insane or something ?
WILL: Exactly . No one listened to him like no one listens to us . And unless we do something , `` IT 's '' never going to stop .
STAN: What do you mean , us , Will ? We 're just kids .
BEVERLY: We hurt it at Neibolt . That 's got ta mean something .
MIKE: Everything dies . Richie looks at Mike , rolls his eyes .
WILL: We can kill it .
RICHIE: Okay Schwarzenegger twins , simme down . We ca n't even free Eddie from `` mom jail '' let alone take down some freaky shape-shifter with a mind- meld on all the adults of Derry . However , I do believe we could sell this story to `` Tales from the crypt . ''
WILL: I do n't think that 's a choice , Stan . `` IT '' knows we know . We hurt it . It 's going to want to hurt us ack .
MIKE: It 's only a matter of time one of us is found half eaten in the Barrens . Or worse .
STAN: I need to study for my bar-mitzvah . Stan goes . All the kids look to each other .
BEVERLY: He 's just scared .
WILL: We 're all scared . That 's what it feeds off of . I heard the clown tell Eddie as much . Our only defense is to stick together .
RICHIE: Yeah well , the only time I 've been spooked is when I 'm with you jokers . I 'm thinking I might be safer at home . At least I know my parents wo n't try to kill me . Richie goes too , leaving just the four .
SHARON: Put it back up there ! Put it back now !
ZACH: I just thought , someone else
SHARON: I do n't care about anyone else . I care about Georgie . I care about my little boy who 's gone .
WILL: Hey .
ZACH: Willy , we need a minute
WILL: Why ? To scream at each other more ?
SHARON: This is between your father and me .
WILL: And Georgie right ? You , dad , and Georgie .
ZACH: Willy , stop .
WILL: No . You stop . I hate it . Tip toeing around you guys like I do n't exist . Like I 'm the one who died and the only one who 's still here is Ge
ZACH: You okay ?
WILL: What do you care ? At least she heard me .
ZACH: SON
WILL: I miss Georgie , too .
ZACH: We know .
WILL: Do you ? Because it seems like every adult in this town is blind to what 's really happening , blind to what any of us kids are going through .
MRS. KASPBRAK: I thought I took the batteries out of that thing ?
DR. HANDOR: How you feeling , son ? Any pain ?
EDDIE: No . Feels fine I guess .
DR. HANDOR: Kept the cast pretty clean , I see . Did n't you want any of your friends to sign it ?
EDDIE: I 'm not allowed to see them .
DR. HANDOR: Why not ?
EDDIE: My Mom thinks they 're the reason I got hurt . She says I 'm sensitive and they do n't take care of me like she does .
DR. HANDOR: She means your allergies ? Is that it ?
EDDIE: Yeah . Mom says I should always carry my Epi-pen with me , in case I ever have an episode .
DR. HANDOR: Mother knows best . Is that it ? Eddie shrugs .
SNATCH: Can I try ?
TRAVIS: Sure . Go put the next target out there .
SNATCH: You 're foolin ' right ?
TRAVIS: Do I look like I 'm foolin ' num nuts ?
SNATCH: It 's not staying .
TRAVIS: Hold it there , butt cheese .
OFFICER BOWERS: Cleaning my gun , huh ?
VICTOR: N-N-No sir . Butch turns the gun on Travis at his feet .
OFFICER BOWERS: You 're not worth the salt you lick oy . I do n't know how I let you squirm your way out your momma 's womb .
TRAVIS: Pa , I'm-
OFFICER BOWERS: Look at him now boys . Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble .
TO TRAVIS: Clean your drawers ` fore you come inside . He spits out his disgust , stalks inside .
VICTOR: You okay , Travis ?
MIKE: Patrick was in one of the lockers . All the water bubbled up from there .
WILL: The sewers .
MIKE: What ?
WILL: `` IT . '' Whenever it shows up , there 's always water around . The storm drain where Georgie died . The leak in my room . Beverly 's sink .
MIKE: My dad saw it near water , too . The canal .
WILL: I 'll bet if you trace every terrible event in Derry you 'll find the same thing . Water . With the Penobscot river on one side and Kenduskeag canal cutting through it 's impossible to escape .
MIKE: Unless you live way out in the sticks like I do . We have to tell the others .
WILL: Shit , Stan 's bar mitzvah . I almost forgot .
MIKE: I was n't invited . Will hands him his invite .
WILL: You are now . Let 's go ! A pair of YELLOW EYES glow from the drain .

MRS. KASPBRAK: Placebo ? Who told you that ? Dr. Handor ? He has no right . No right to say you 're making up you sickness .
EDDIE: Not me , momma You .
MRS. KASPBRAK: What ?
EDDIE: He said I was never allergic until you made me start carrying around my Epi-pen . You put those allergies in my head .
MRS. KASPBRAK: That 's a lie , Eddie ! A bold faced lie . You 're my treasure . The only thing I want in this world is to see you safe and healthy .
EDDIE: Then why did you send my friends away ?
MRS. KASPBRAK: They were bad boys . You know that . And you You were so sick when you were little . So very sick . It hurt me so much . I never want to see you go through that again . And I 've kept you healthy , have n't I ?

POP: Still after that first million before you 're thirty .
GEORGE: No , I 'll settle for half that in cash . Annie comes in again from the kitchen .
POP: Of course , it 's just a hope , but you would n't consider coming back to the Building and Loan , would you ? Annie stops serving to hear his answer .
GEORGE: Well , I Annie , why do n't you draw up a chair ? Then you 'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that 's going on .
ANNIE: I would if I thought I 'd hear anything worth listening to .
GEORGE: You would , huh ?
POP: I know it 's soon to talk about it .
GEORGE: Oh , now , Pop , I could n't . I could n't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office .
POP: You know , George , I feel that in a small way we are doing something important . Satisfying a fundamental urge . It 's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace , and we 're helping him get those things in our shabby little office .
GEORGE: I know , Dad . I wish I felt But I 've been hoarding pennies like a miser in order to Most of my friends have already finished college . I just feel like if I do n't get away , I 'd bust .

GEORGE: Mary Mary , I 'm sorry . I 've got to go .
HARRY: Come on , George , let 's hurry .
GEORGE: Did you get a doctor ?
UNCLE BILLY: Yes , Campbell 's there now .
DR. CAMPBELL: I think that 's all we 'll need you for , George . I know you 're anxious to make a train .
GEORGE: I have a taxi waiting downstairs .
DR. CAMPBELL: I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months . Good luck to you at school , George .
GEORGE: Thanks .
DR. CAMPBELL: Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting – to appoint a successo to our dear friend , Peter Bailey .
POTTER: Mr. Chairman , I 'd like to get to my eal purpose .
MAN: Wait just a minute now .
POTTER: Wait for what ? I claim this institution is not necessary to this town . Therefore , Mr. Chairman , I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver .
UNCLE BILLY: George , you hear what that buzzard
LAWYER: Mr. Chairman , it 's too soon afte Peter Bailey 's death to discuss chloroforming the Building and Loan .
MAN: Peter Bailey died three months ago . I second Mr. Potter 's motion .
DR. CAMPBELL: Very well . In that case I 'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw .
GEORGE: Thank you very much .
DR. CAMPBELL: It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization .
POTTER: I 'll go further than that . I 'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan . Everyone looks at him surprised .
UNCLE BILLY: Oh , that 's fine , Potter , coming from you , considering that you probably drove him to his grave .
POTTER: Peter Bailey was not a business man . That 's what killed him . Oh , I do n't mean any disrespect to him , God rest his soul . He was a man of high ideals , so-called , but ideals without common sense can ruin this town . Now , you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop You know , that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi . You know I happen to know the bank turned down this loan , ut he comes here and we 're building him a house worth five thousand dollars . Why ?
GEORGE: Well , I handled that , Mr. Potter . You have all the papers there . His salary , insurance . I can personally vouch for his character .
POTTER: A friend of yours ?
GEORGE: Yes , sir .
POTTER: You see , if you shoot pool with some employee here , you can come and borrow money . What does that get us ? A discontented , lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class . And all ecause a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas . Now , I say
GEORGE: Just a minute – just a minute . Now , hold on , Mr. Potter . You 're right when you say my father was no business man . I know that . Why he ever started this cheap , penny-ante Building and Loan , I 'll never know . But neithe you nor anybody else can say anything against his character , because his whole life was Why , in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing , he never once thought of himself . Is n't that right , Uncle Billy ? He did n't save enough money to send Harry to school , let alone me . But he did help a few people get out of your slums , Mr. Potter . And what 's wrong with that ? Why Here , you 're all businessmen here . Does n't it make them better citizens ? Does n't it make them better customers ? You you said What 'd you say just a minute ago ? They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home . Wait ! Wait for what ? Until their children grow up and leave them ? Until they 're so old and broken- down that they Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars ? Just remembe this , Mr. Potter , that this rabble you 're talking about they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community . Well , is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath ? Anyway , my father did n't think so . People were human beings to him , but to you , a warped , frustrated old man , they 're cattle . Well , in my book he died a much richer man than you 'll ever be !
POTTER: I 'm not interested in your book . I 'm talking about the Building and Loan .
GEORGE: I know very well what you 're talking about . You 're talking about something you ca n't get your fingers on , and it 's galling you . That 's what you 're talking about , I know . Well , I 've said too much . I You 're the Board here . You do what you want with this thing . Just one thing more , though . This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter . Come on , Uncle Billy !
POTTER: Sentimental hogwash ! I want my motion
UNCLE BILLY: Boy , oh , boy , that was telling him , George , old boy . You shut his big mouth . You should have heard him .
COUSIN EUSTACE: What happened ? We heard a lot of yelling .
UNCLE BILLY: Well , we 're being voted out of usiness after twenty-five years . Easy come , easy go .
COUSIN TILLY: Here it is , `` Help Wanted – Female . ''
ERNIE: You still want me to hang around , George ?
GEORGE: Yeah , I 'll be right down .
UNCLE BILLY: Hey , you 'll miss your train . You 're a week late for school already . Go on .
GEORGE: I wonder what 's going on in there ?
UNCLE BILLY: Oh , never mind . Do n't worry about that . They 're putting us out of usiness . So what ? I can get anothe job . I 'm only fifty-five .
COUSIN TILLY: Fifty-six !
UNCLE BILLY: Go on – go on . Hey , look , you gave up your boat trip , now you do n't want to miss college too , do you ? Dr. Campbell comes running out , all excited .
DR. CAMPBELL: George ! George ! They voted Potte down ! They want to keep it going !
UNCLE BILLY: Whoopee !
DR. CAMPBELL: But they 've got one condition – only one condition .
GEORGE: What 's that ?
DR. CAMPBELL: That 's the best part of it . They 've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father 's place .
GEORGE: Oh , no ! But , Uncle Billy
DR. CAMPBELL: You can keep him on . That 's all right . As secretary you can hire anyone you like .
GEORGE: Dr. Campbell , now let 's get this thing straight . I 'm leaving . I 'm leaving right now . I 'm going to school . This is my last chance . Uncle Billy here , he 's your man .
DR. CAMPBELL: But , George , they 'll vote with Potte otherwise .
CLARENCE'S VOICE: I know . I know . He did n't go .
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That 's right . Not only that , but he gave his school money to his brothe Harry , and sent him to college . Harry ecame a football star – made second team All American .

GEORGE: Why did n't you call me ?
UNCLE BILLY: I just did , but they said you left . This is a pickle , George , this is a pickle .
GEORGE: All right now , what happened ? How did it start ?
UNCLE BILLY: How does anything like this eve start ? All I know is the bank called our loan .
GEORGE: When ?
UNCLE BILLY: About an hour ago . I had to hand over all our cash .
GEORGE: All of it ?
UNCLE BILLY: Every cent of it , and it still was less than we owe .
GEORGE: Holy mackerel !
UNCLE BILLY: And then I got scared , George , and closed the doors . I I I
GEORGE: The whole town 's gone crazy . The telephone rings . Uncle Billy picks it up .
UNCLE BILLY: Yes , hello ? George it 's Potter .
GEORGE: Hello ?
POTTER: George , there is a rumor around town that you 've closed your doors . Is that true ? Oh , well , I 'm very glad to hear that George , are you all ight ? Do you need any police ?
GEORGE: Police ? What for ?
POTTER: Well , mobs get pretty ugly sometimes , you know . George , I 'm going all out to help in this crisis . I 've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs . They 'll close up for a week , and then reopen .
GEORGE: He just took over the bank .
POTTER: I may lose a fortune , but I 'm willing to guarantee your people too . Just tell them to bring their shares ove here and I will pay them fifty cents on the dollar .
GEORGE: Aw , you never miss a trick , do you , Potter ? Well , you 're going to miss this one .
POTTER: If you close your doors before six P.M. you will never reopen .
UNCLE BILLY: George , was it a nice wedding ? Gosh , I wanted to be there .
GEORGE: Yeah you can take this one off now .
ED: But , George , I got my money here .
CHARLIE: Did he guarantee this place ?
GEORGE: Well , no , Charlie . I did n't even ask him . We do n't need Potter over here .
CHARLIE: I 'll take mine now .
GEORGE: No , but you you you 're thinking of this place all wrong . As if I had the money back in a safe . The money 's not here . Your money 's in Joe 's house right next to yours . And in the Kennedy house , and Mrs. Macklin 's house , and a hundred others . Why , you 're lending them the money to uild , and then , they 're going to pay it back to you as best they can . Now what are you going to do ? Foreclose on them ?
TOM: I got two hundred and forty-two dollars in here , and two hundred and forty-two dollars is n't going to eak anybody .

MRS. THOMPSON: Are you going to go to Potter 's ?
TOM: Better to get half than nothing .
GEORGE: Tom ! Tom ! Randall ! Now wait now listen now listen to me . I beg of you not to do this thing . If Potte gets hold of this Building and Loan there 'll never be another decent house built in this town . He 's already got charge of the bank . He 's got the bus line . He 's got the department stores . And now he 's after us . Why ? Well , it 's very simple . Because we 're cutting in on his business , that 's why . And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides .
MRS. THOMPSON: But my husband has n't worked in ove a year , and I need money .
WOMAN: How am I going to live until the ank opens ?

TOM: That 'll close my account .
GEORGE: Your account 's still here . That 's a loan .
ED: I got three hundred dollars here , George .
GEORGE: Aw , now , Ed what 'll it take till the bank reopens ? What do you need ?
ED: Well , I suppose twenty dollars .
GEORGE: Twenty dollars . Now you 're talking . Fine . Thanks , Ed . All right , now , Mrs. Thompson . How much do you want ?
MRS. THOMPSON: But it 's your own money , George .
GEORGE: Never mind about that . How much do you want ?
MRS. THOMPSON: I can get along with twenty , all ight .
GEORGE: Twenty dollars .
MRS. THOMPSON: And I 'll sign a paper .
GEORGE: You do n't have to sign anything . I know you 'll pay it back when you can . That 's okay . All right , Mrs. Davis .
MRS. DAVIS: Could I have seventeen-fifty ?

GEORGE: Sam Wainwright !
MARY: Oh , who cares . Bread ! That this house may neve know hunger . Mrs. Martini crosses herself .
GEORGE: And wine ! That joy and prosperity may reign forever . Enter the Martini castle !
REINEMAN: Look , Mr. Potter , it 's no skin off my nose . I 'm just your little rent collector . But you ca n't laugh off this Bailey Park any more . Look at it .
SECRETARY'S VOICE: Congressman Blatz is here to see you .
POTTER: Oh , tell the congressman to wait . Go on .
REINEMAN: Fifteen years ago , a half-dozen houses stuck here and there . There 's the old cemetery , squirrels , uttercups , daisies . Used to hunt abbits there myself . Look at it today . Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw . Ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay ent to you . Your Potter 's Field , my dear Mr . Employer , is becoming just that . And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks !
POTTER: Oh , they are , are they ? Even though they know the Baileys have n't made a dime out of it .
REINEMAN: You know very well why . The Baileys were all chumps . Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build . If I were you , Mr. Potter
POTTER: Well , you are not me .
REINEMAN: As I say , it 's no skin off my nose . But one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George Bailey for a job . Reineman exits .
POTTER: The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough . He flips the switch on the dictaphone .
SECRETARY'S VOICE: Yes , sir ?
POTTER: Come in here .
SAM: We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory , and then we 're going to drive on down to Florida .
GEORGE: Oh
JANE: Why do n't you have your friends join us ?
SAM: Why , sure . Hey , why do n't you kids drive down with us , huh ?
GEORGE: Oh , I 'm afraid I could n't get away , Sam .
SAM: Still got the nose to the old grindstone , eh ? Jane , I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics , and he turned me down cold .
GEORGE: Oh , now , do n't rub it in .
SAM: I 'm not rubbing it in . Well , I guess we better run along .
JANE: Awfully glad to have met you , Mary .
MARY: Nice meeting you .
GEORGE: Goodbye .
JANE: Goodbye , George .
SAM: So long , George . See you in the funny papers .
GEORGE: Goodbye , Sam .
MARY: Have fun .
GEORGE: Thanks for dropping around .
SAM: To Florida ! Hee-haw !
GEORGE: Hee-haw .
GEORGE: Thank you , sir . Quite a cigar , Mr. Potter .
POTTER: You like it ? I 'll send you a box .
GEORGE: Well , I I suppose I 'll find out sooner or later , but just what exactly did you want to see me about ?
POTTER: George , now that 's just what I like so much about you . George , I 'm an old man , and most people hate me . But I do n't like them either , so that makes it all even . You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan . You know , also , that for a number of years I 've been trying to get control of it or kill it . But I have n't been able to do it . You have been stopping me . In fact , you have beaten me , George , and as anyone in this county can tell you , that takes some doing . Take during the depression , for instance . You and I were the only ones that kept ou heads . You saved the Building and Loan , and I saved all the rest .
GEORGE: Yes . Well , most people say you stole all the rest .
POTTER: The envious ones say that , George , the suckers . Now , I have stated my side very frankly . Now , let 's look at your side . Young man , twenty- seven , twenty-eight married , making , say forty a week .
GEORGE: Forty-five !
POTTER: Forty-five . Forty-five . Out of which , after supporting your mother , and paying your bills , you 're able to keep , say , ten , if you skimp . A child or two comes along , and you wo n't even be able to save the ten . Now , if this young man of twenty-eight was a common , ordinary yokel , I 'd say he was doing fine . But George Bailey is not a common , ordinary yokel . He 's an intelligent , smart , ambitious young man — who hates his job – who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do . A young man who 's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born . A young man the smartest one of the crowd , mind you , a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places , because he 's trapped . Yes , sir , trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters . Do I paint a correct picture , or do I exaggerate ?
GEORGE: Now what 's your point , Mr. Potter ?
POTTER: My point ? My point is , I want to hire you .
GEORGE: Hire me ?
POTTER: I want you to manage my affairs , run my properties . George , I 'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year .
GEORGE: Twenty thou twenty thousand dollars a year ?
POTTER: You would n't mind living in the nicest house in town , buying your wife a lot of fine clothes , a couple of usiness trips to New York a year , maybe once in a while Europe . You would n't mind that , would you , George ?
GEORGE: Would I ? You 're not talking to somebody else around here , are you ? You know , this is me , you remember me ? George Bailey .
POTTER: Oh , yes , George Bailey . Whose ship has just come in – providing he has ains enough to climb aboard .
GEORGE: Well , what about the Building and Loan ?
POTTER: Oh , confound it , man , are you afraid of success ? I 'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year , starting today . Is it a deal or is n't it ?
GEORGE: Well , Mr. Potter , I I I know I ought to jump at the chance , but I I just I wonder if it would e possible for you to give me twenty- four hours to think it over ?
POTTER: Sure , sure , sure . You go on home and talk about it to your wife .
GEORGE: I 'd like to do that .
POTTER: In the meantime , I 'll draw up the papers .
GEORGE: All right , sir .
POTTER: Okay , George ?
GEORGE: Okay , Mr. Potter .
POTTER'S VOICE: You would n't mind living in the nicest house in town . Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes , going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year . Maybe to Europe once in a while .
GEORGE'S VOICE: I know what I 'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that . I 'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet , and I 'm going to see the world And I 'm going to build things . I 'm going to build air fields . I 'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high . I 'm going to uild a bridge a mile long .
MARY: Buffalo Gals , wo n't you come out tonight , wo n't you come out tonight , wo n't you come out tonight .
GEORGE: Hi .
MARY: Hi .
GEORGE: Mary Hatch , why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me ?
MARY: To keep from being an old maid .
GEORGE: You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town .
MARY: I did n't want to marry anybody else in town . I want my baby to look like you .
GEORGE: You did n't even have a honeymoon . I promised you Your what ?
MARY: My baby .
GEORGE: You mean Mary , you on the nest ?
MARY: George Bailey lassos stork .
GEORGE: Lassos the stork ! You mean you What is it , a boy or a girl ? Mary nods her head happily .

MARY: I 'll get it . Hello . Yes , this is Mrs. Bailey .
GEORGE: Is that Zuzu 's teacher ?
MARY: Yes .
GEORGE: Let me speak to her . He snatches the phone from Mary .
MARY: George !
GEORGE: Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for – to have teachers like you ? Silly , stupid , careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on ? You know , maybe my kids are n't the best-dressed kids ; maybe they do n't have any decent clothes
MARY: Hello , Mrs. Welch . I want to apologize hello hello She 's hung up .

POTTER: Oh , so that 's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about ?
GEORGE: The reporters ?
POTTER: Yes . They called me up from you Building and Loan . Oh , there 's a man over there from the D.A . 's office , too . He 's looking for you .
GEORGE: Please help me , Mr. Potter . Help me , wo n't you please ? Ca n't you see what it means to my family ? I 'll pay you any sort of a bonus on the loan any interest . If you still want the Building and Loan , why I
POTTER: George , could it possibly be there 's a slight discrepancy in the books ?
GEORGE: No , sir . There 's nothing wrong with the books . I 've just misplaced eight thousand dollars . I ca n't find it anywhere .
POTTER: You misplaced eight thousand dollars ?
GEORGE: Yes , sir .
POTTER: Have you notified the police ?
GEORGE: No , sir . I did n't want the publicity . Harry 's homecoming tomorrow
POTTER: They 're going to believe that one . What 've you been doing , George ? Playing the market with the company 's money ?
GEORGE: No , sir . No , sir . I have n't .
POTTER: What is it – a woman , then ? You know , it 's all over town that you 've been giving money to Violet Bick .
GEORGE: What ?
POTTER: Not that it makes any difference to me , but why did you come to me ? Why do n't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money ?
GEORGE: I ca n't get hold of him . He 's in Europe .
POTTER: Well , what about all your othe friends ?
GEORGE: They do n't have that kind of money , Mr. Potter . You know that . You 're the only one in town that can help me .
POTTER: I see . I 've suddenly become quite important . What kind of security would I have , George ? Have you got any stocks ?
GEORGE: No , sir .
POTTER: Bonds ? Real estate ? Collateral of any kind ?
GEORGE: I have some life insurance , a fifteen thousand dollar policy .
POTTER: Yes how much is your equity in it ?
GEORGE: Five hundred dollars .
POTTER: Look at you . You used to be so cocky ! You were going to go out and conque the world ! You once called me a warped , frustrated old man . What are you but a warped , frustrated young man ? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and egging for help . No securities – no stocks – no bonds – nothing but a miserable little five hundred dolla equity in a life insurance policy . You 're worth more dead than alive . Why do n't you go to the riff-raff you love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar ? You know why ? Because they 'd run you out of town on a rail But I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do for you , George . Since the state examiner is still here , as a stockholder of the Building and Loan , I 'm going to swea out a warrant for your arrest . Misappropriation of funds – manipulation – malfeasance

CLARENCE: Yeah , it 's against the law where I come from , too .
TOLLKEEPER: Where do you come from ?
CLARENCE: Heaven . I had to act quickly ; that 's why I jumped in . I knew if I were drowning you 'd try to save me . And you see , you did , and that 's how I saved you .

CLARENCE: You 've never been born . You do n't exist . You have n't a care in the world . George feels his ear as Clarence talks .
GEORGE: Say something else in that ear .
CLARENCE: Sure . You can hear out of it .
GEORGE: Well , that 's the doggonedest thing I have n't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid . Must have een that jump in the cold water .

JANE: Hi .
DOCTOR: Hi . I 'm Dr. Moss .
JANE: Hi . Jane Adler . So , I just wanted to start with and please do n't take this the wrong way but I 'm the type of person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery .
DR. MOSS: I understand .
JANE: You do ? Good , because , you know , some women can look a little fake and plasticky . And in my opinion worse .
DR. MOSS: I agree .
JANE: Oh , that 's good , so , well , as against the whole thing as I am , I do have a problem that 's been ugging me . My left eyelid is eally saggy . I find I 'm sometimes holding it up when I 'm watching TV or reading and I was wondering if that 's something you could fix .
DR. MOSS: It 's resting on your eye lashes .
JANE: Is it ?
DR. MOSS: Actually you have the same amount of excess skin on both sides .
JANE: I do ? Well , I 'm only interested in fixing one eye .
DR. MOSS: Jane , what you need to fix this is a brow lift .
JANE: A brow lift ? Wh-what is that exactly ?
DR. MOSS: We surgically cut at your hai line . Incision goes right across here . Then we just lift the skin up a little tighter across the skull . We staple it back in place right above your ears . Recovery is n't all that bad but you could be fairly numb and you 'll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say 3 to 6 months .
AGNESS: Jane !
JANE: Hey..
JAKE: Hiii .
JANE: Hello .

JAKE: See you there .
TRISHA: That is beyond .

DIANE: Jake has lost his mind .
JANE: Oh , I do n't know
DIANE: I know . First of all , he was a complete prick for cheating on you .
JANE: Well , ca n't disagree with that .
DIANE: And then he marries her a known lunatic .
JANE: She has a big job .
TRISHA: Why do you always say that ?

DIANE: Janey , come on , he cheats on you with her , your 20 year marriage ends then six months later she leaves Jake for some random guy , has a baby , leaves that guy , marries Jake and she 's not nuts ?

JANE: Wooo .
ADAM: It 's been a process .
JANE: Here 's the good news . In two more years you 'll actually begin to feel normal again .
ADAM: In two more years I 'll begin to feel normal ? Why am I having trouble seeing that as good news ?
JANE: Maybe that was just my experience .
ADAM: Oh God , I hope so .
JANE: Yes , I 'd love that .
ADAM: Thought so .
JANE: I have an idea what if we move my bedroom like six or eight feet so I can get more of the morning light ?
ADAM: Yes , but you 'll wake up in the morning , open your bedroom door and fall 12 feet into your kitchen .
JANE: Ahhh ! Forgot it was all open up there !
ADAM: But I get where you 're headed . Let me see what I can do This property is so great Have you lived here a long time ?
JANE: About ten years . I bought this place right after my divorce but it 's taken me until now to be able to finally do this .
JAKE: Good morning ! Am I interrupting ?
JANE: Hi . No , well , we were just about done . Adam , this is my ex-husband , Jake . Jake , this is Adam Schaeffer , my architect .
JAKE: Hi .
ADAM: Good to meet you .
JAKE: Can I take a look ? Do you mind ?
JANE: Everything 's not 100 % worked out yet
JAKE: Wow . You 're finally getting the kitchen you always wanted
JANE: Yeah
JAKE: Huge bedroom .
JANE: It 's not huge . Why do n't I show these to you when we get a little closer .
ADAM: So , I think next we should stake out the addition see how it all feels - size wise
JANE: Sounds great .
ADAM: I 'll e-mail you and we 'll set it up . We did good work today . Jake , nice meeting you .
JAKE: Got time for a cup of coffee ?
JANE: Jake , come on . This is just too weird . We have to just never do what we did - ever again . You 're an adulterer and I 'm an awful person , basically . I have n't slept in days . What we did was just so wrong on so many levels .
JAKE: And it was so right on a couple of levels too . Admit it .
JANE: No ! It was n't ! On no levels was it right !
JAKE: You ca n't say we did n't enjoy each other 's company . Sitting at the ar , dancingafter dancing Come on , you and I have n't had fun like that in a hundred years .
JANE: Yes ! Because we 're not supposed to have fun like that ! We 're divorced ! Are you like , what ? Unhappy at home ? Does she not `` understand '' you ? Did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age ? What is this ?
JAKE: I 'd be lying if I said I neve think about you , Janey . I think about you . A lot . And no , it 's not perfect at home . Obviously . Look at me . I 've got three grown kids and I 'm going to kindergarten interviews . I 'm a walking cliche .
JANE: Not high on my list these days .
JAKE: But what if that someone is someone who 's known you since you 're 23 and loved you for most of your life .
JANE: I forgot what a good lawyer you are .
JAKE: Give this a shot , Janey . Life is short and it 's tough . Do n't discount what we have with each other . You know what they say people in nursing homes who have plants live longer than the people without plants .
JANE: Oh , so you 're saying you think this is a healthy choice for me ?
JAKE: Honey , I know it is .
JANE: Oh , God , it 's official . We 're having an affair .
JAKE: Why do you need to label everything ?
JANE: Because that 's what this is .
JAKE: Yes , in its crassest form , maybe , if we were two other people .
JANE: Just because we were married for 19 years does not not make this an affair .
JAKE: Okay , but since we were togethe for so long , it 's not really that wrong .
JANE: Really ? You want to run that logic y your wife ?
JAKE: Since when is this your side ?
JANE: Since ten years ago . Please
JAKE: Could I interest you in a little
JANE: No !
JAKE: Why do you think the sex is so much sexier this time ?
JANE: I do n't know .
JAKE: Me too . Okay
JANE: Can you hand me my robe ?
JAKE: Why do I have to.. ?
JANE: Because the last time you saw me standing up naked I was in my forties . Things look different lying down . Just
JAKE: You 've gotten a little nuts .
JANE: Jake , I think it would be really good for us to not talk for a few days . Okay ?
JAKE: You know what I think just fo the record ? I think we 're doing something kinda brilliant . All the things that tore us apart are n't issues anymore . I 'd say ou problems actually went away .
JANE: What.. ?
JAKE: Did n't you always say you felt you were n't being heard ? Was n't that our big issue both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated . Look at us now . You 're so much more together , you 're not exhausted all the time , you 're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and I 'm calmer , less obsessed about work . I 'm a partner . I 'm there . We grew into the people we wanted each other to be ! And I do n't know I appreciate things about you I could n't even see efore .
JANE: Really ?
JAKE: Do you remember never having time for sex ? Now look at us . We 've already done it two times this week and it 's only Tuesday . I swear to God , if half the couples who got divorced , could get back together 10 years later , thei problems would be solved . I think we 're on to something .
JANE: Not sure I agree andalso , we 're not back together .
JAKE: And I know other divorced people think about thisthey wonder - what if . I think this is very French of us .
JANE: How is this French of us ?
JAKE: I have a young wife but I 'm having sex with my old wife . Not old , you know . Ex ! I did n't mean old
JANE: You miss it ?
JAKE: So much .
JANE: We sell it for $ 6.50 a bag at the store .
JAKE: Yeah , why give it away when you can Kiss good bye ?
TRISHA: Oh my God , now what ? Three pies ? ! This is a feast !
JANE: I do n't know what 's going on , I have so much energy lately which I think is probably a result of all the sex I 'm having . Yeah . I 'm actually not kidding . I 'm having an affair . With a married man .
DIANE: What ? When did this happen ? Where 'd you meet him ?
JANE: Well , it started in New York .
DIANE: In New York ? ? ? Last week ?
JANE: Yeah , we did it once there and once here . Maybe more than once there , I was drunk so
TRISHA: You had drunken sex with a married man in New York when you went fo Luke 's graduation ?
JANE: Turns out I 'm a bit of a slut . Apple , Blueberry or Plum ?
DIANE: Wait , wait , wait . Hold on . You 're not saying ! ! ! !
JOANNE: What ?
TRISHA: No ! You 're not !
JANE: Oh , God , but I am . I 'm having an affair with Agness Adler 's husband .
TRISHA: That . Is . Genius !
JOANNE: But also sort of wrong .
JANE: I know .
DIANE: Oh , please . Not that wrong .
JANE: I know ! I 'm so happy to be able to tell someone . This is the most out of control thing I 've ever done . Literally . You know me .
DIANE: Yes we do . You do n't do anything wrong , or bad . Ever . So you 're allowed this one . I 'm sorry I kinda love it .
JOANNE: He was yours first .
JANE: True . Not that I want him back by the way .

JANE: I wo n't
DIANE: There is something kinda perfect about this . You do n't have to cook for him or clean up after him o actually even sleep with him .
JANE: Yeah , I have an Ex with benefits
TRISHA: Oh , forget that . Agness is still the one we hate . Even in this scenario .
DIANE: Yeah , karma is the ultimate bitch on this one .
JANE: Reynaldo , I 'm changing the eakfast menu , want to give it a little more life What do you think ?
REYNALDO: What 'd you do ? Something to your hair ?
JANE: I do n't think so .
REYNALDO: Something about you looks different . Little more `` caliente . ''
JANE: Caliente ?
REYNALDO: You see it Eddie ?
EDDIE: Whatever it is , it 's workin ' .
JANE: Hello . No ! I did n't do this again !
ADAM: If I were your shrink I 'd say maybe you do n't really want to build this house .

PEDRO: Jake took a shower with his clothes on .
JAKE: Pedro ! Darling
AGNESS: What 's he talking about ?
JAKE: I do n't speak Pedro . That 's you department .
AGNESS: Do n't go in the kitchen , P , I broke something . Yo . Can you help ?
ADAM: That looks amazing .
JANE: It 's called a croque-monsieur . It 's one of the first things I learned to make when I lived in Paris ecause the ingredients are really eally cheap .
ADAM: When did you live in Paris ?
JANE: In my early twenties . I went there to take a six day pastry class and ended up staying a year working as an apprentice in a bakery .
ADAM: You are rapidly becoming one of the most appreciative clients I 've eve had
JANE: Well , I 'm not all that used to eing able to count on anyone
ADAM: Really ?
JANE: I know it 's none of my business ut I 'm trying to figure out why someone like you is divorced .
ADAM: And what 'd you come up with ?
JANE: Something in the you 're too nice department.. ?
ADAM: Yes , that and my wife fell in love with my best friend . Ex-best friend .
JANE: Oh , no !
ADAM: We were all on a biking trip , he and his wife , me and my wifethrough Tuscany and on the last day of the trip they announced they were in love .
JANE: That 's awful .
ADAM: Yeah . Not a great plane ride home .
JANE: I can imagine , sitting there fo eleven hours with your wife who you know is oh , that 's rough .
ADAM: Actually they went on to Venice and I flew back with Carol , his wife . You ca n't imagine what it 's like to sit next to someone who 's been crying for ten straight hours .
JANE: I do n't blame her .
ADAM: I was talking about me . Anyway , they 're married now and it 's pretty much an ongoing awful thing . But , you and your ex When I saw him stop by for a cup of coffee the other morning , I thought Wow ! That 's the way it 's supposed to be . You two seem to have it all figured out .
JANE: We 're not as figured out as you 'd think .
ADAM: Uh , constantly actually .
JANE: Constantly ?
ADAM: Everyone I know or have ever known has fixed me up . And then , sometimes I just meet women , I do n't know how that happens , but
JANE: But no girlfriend ?
ADAM: Not yet .
JANE: Just like to date
ADAM: Actually , I find it really stressful . You know , the last time I was in the dating world was 1978 . It 's a little more complicated these days . I ca n't tell you how nice it is to have a conversation with a woman and have the pressure off . Not to mention , a home cooked meal that no one else I know could possibly cook .
JANE: No . No .
ADAM: No ?
JANE: Aw , thank you . I always make ice cream when I ca n't sleep , so I 'm glad someone was here to eat it .
ADAM: Great getting to know you a little .
JANE: It was really fun .
JANE: What are you doing here ?
JAKE: Missed you .
JANE: It 's nine o'clock . Where does you wife think you are ?
JAKE: At yoga . Shall we do some downward facing dog ?
JANE: Not tonight big guy .
JAKE: Is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes ? I wo n't think less of you , you know .
JANE: Really , Jake , I 'm a little tired , I was just gon na take a bath .
JAKE: Good . So , we 'll just hang out . Ooooo , is that Croque-Monsieur ? Who 's plate is this ? Yours or his ?
JANE: Mine .
JAKE: Oh my God , just as I remember it .
JANE: Do n't you ever eat at your house ?
JAKE: Pedro dictates all meals and he has a very limited palate . What kind of ice cream is that ?
JANE: Lavender Honey .
JAKE: Not sleeping ?
JANE: Not at all . You ?
JAKE: Never slept better . And my digestion is finally back on track . You 've turned my world right side up , Jane . You know what this means , do n't you ?
JANE: No
JAKE: That I 've never really known how to live without you .
JANE: Hate to tell you , big guy , but we already grew old apart .
JAKE: What 's with the ` big guy ' ? Is that ecause you think I 'm fat or is it a term of endearment ?
JANE: I have no idea why I keep saying that . I 'm sorry . I 'll stop .
JAKE: Thank you . I love how quiet it is in you house . I have no quiet in my life . Ever .
JANE: Yeah , well , you live with a five year old .
JAKE: Yesand do n't forget Pedro .
JANE: So what does that mean exactly ? What 's going on over there at you place ?
JAKE: My marriage is not turning out as I hoped . That 's obvious . Agness started out really looking up to me We never used to fight ut now with the kid.lately we 're all about where he 's gon na go to school and now she says we need a bigger house , more help . I was thinking of cutting back at work now that 's never gon na happen . And she wants another baby before Pedro gets too old which I get but since we 're always fighting oh , God , listen to me .
JANE: Is n't a baby part of the deal when you marry a woman that age ?
JAKE: Is it ? I guess so . She 's got me ooked at the fertility cente every other day and she 's so amped up on hormone injections I may need to find an exorcist if she does n't calm down . I wish it was funny . Incredible ice cream . I 'm turning around Remember when we used to smoke pot and eat your ice cream in the hot tub ?
JANE: The `` hot tub '' That feels like a illion years ago .
JAKE: How long has it been since you
JANE: Me ? Since before Lauren was born .
JAKE: 27 years ? ! !
JANE: At least .
JAKE: Exactly .
JANE: I 'm not going to .
JAKE: Okay , why do n't I leave this with you Maybe you 'll take a few hits
JANE: Maybe .
JAKE: So that nerdy architect likes youyou know that , right ?
JANE: He 's not nerdy and he definitely does n't . We 're working together .
JAKE: I was watching when you bent down to open the oven , his eyes were glued to your ass .
JANE: Hey , will you do me a favor ?
JAKE: Tell the truth , Janey is this a great affair , or what ?
JANE: I do n't know . It 's my first .
JAKE: We do n't even have to have sex and it 's fun . I wish I could sleep over .
JANE: I got ta tell my shrink about this . This is a lot to handle . I guess you should go I 'm sure yoga 's probably closed by now .
JAKE: It 's okay
JANE: Wow , wow , wowwhat 's happening , Jake ?
JAKE: Do n't get it .
JANE: I always get it . I have three kids . Hello . Hiii You still on the plane ? How was Luke when you left ? Oh , that sounds like fun . Let me know what I can bring.. No ! Do n't have any idea where he is . Okay , honey , talk to you tomorrow . Now I 'm lying Lauren and Harley are giving Luke a graduation party this weekend . Sweet , huh ?
JAKE: Hello stranger . Welcome back .
JANE: Dr. Allen !
DR. ALLEN: Jane . Hi . Am I seeing you today ?
JANE: No , I just need to talkand I was wondering if there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session . I 'm sort of desperate for some advice . I ought you some of that coffee cake you like . Not as a bribe o anything
DR. ALLEN: I only have twenty minutes until my first patient .
JANE: That 's fine . I 'll talk fast .
DR. ALLEN: It 's not good . It 's not bad .
JANE: I am . Definitely . I 've made a list of what this can possibly be aboutat my end . Can I read it to you ?
DR. ALLEN: Of course .
JANE: Thanks . I e-mailed it to myself . Okay . Am I still trying to figure out why the marriage failed ? Do I want to get back together ? Do we have unfinished business ? Is this about revenge ? Am I just lonely ? Or , is it my `` caretaker '' thing ?
JANE: And , listen , I get how therapy works , I do We look at things , we examine them , weeks turn into months , what. ? we 're going on eight years , right ? . and I 'm okay with that , I like it but in this case , I need to know what you eally think . Like , I 'd like you to say Do n't do this , it 's absolutely wrong or go ahead , you 'll be fine . I actually want to e told what to do .
DR. ALLEN: What 's interesting is I 'm already seeing you open up more than I have in some time . I 'm thinking , through this affair , you may learn to view the world in a different way .
JANE: I 'm sorry . I need more concrete . Are you saying I should keep seeing him ? Because , honestly , if the guilt and fear could go away , maybe I could let go a little and figure this out .
DR. ALLEN: I would n't resist looking at this .
JANE: Okay and another way of saying that is . ?
DR. ALLEN: Let go Jane . It ca n't hurt . Jane fist pumps in the air .
NURSE: Jacob Adler ?

WEDDING SPECIALIST: I adore October weddings . Let me show you what we did last October .
HARLEY: Honey , I 'm gon na make that phone call from the
HOTEL DOC: What 's the room number ?
RECEPTION CLERK: 408 . Adler . His wife said he 's conscious now
HOTEL DOC: On my way .
JANE: How 's his heart ?
HOTEL DOC: Do you have a heart condition , Mr. Adler ?
JAKE: No . And I just had a check up .
JANE: You did ? Oh , that 's good .
HOTEL DOC: Deep breath . So , no chest pain ?
JAKE: None .
HOTEL DOC: When you got dizzy , did you feel your heart was beating funny ?
JAKE: Yes , but I was admiring my eautiful
HOTEL DOC: Well that 's nice to hear afte all these years Did you forget to take any of you medications today ?
JAKE: Took ` em all .
HOTEL DOC: What all did you take ?
JAKE: Uh.Lipitor , baby aspirin.. Flomax .
JANE: Flomax ?
JAKE: Yes , otherwise I pee 40 times a day .
HOTEL DOC: How long have you been taking the Flomax ?
JAKE: Not that long . And I only take it sporadically . I have to sneak it actually . It reduces semen and that 's not good for my wife right now . Sorry .
HOTEL DOC: Really.. ?
JANE: Yes , I prefer a lot of semen . Always have . Okay , well , thank you so much fo coming . Looks like he 's gon na live , so
HOTEL DOC: Yeah , my guess is Flomax is probably the culprit here . It can definitely give you a sudden drop in blood pressure so I suggest you stay off it for a few weeks , which apparently your wife will appreciate .
JANE: Yeah . Really good for me .
HOTEL DOC: And I suggest you rest quietly fo the rest of the afternoon . No hanky panky , Mrs. Adler .
JANE: No chance . I assure you .
LAUREN: Are you acting like this because of the wedding ? Tell me the truth ?
HARLEY: Not at all . Swear to God .
LAUREN: Because I do n't want to be one of those couples where the guy goes into a coma the whole time we plan the wedding . It 's not worth it to me .
HARLEY: Okay ! We 're back in business !
JAKE: See . Just that moveyou have no idea . Not everyone 's like that
JANE: Jake , I have a confession to make . Back when we broke up I knew it was n't all your fault .
JAKE: You mean that ? You 've never said that to me before .
JANE: I know . Because when you cheated , I did n't have to . But I think in some way , I gave up on us and I 'm not sure you ever really did .
JAKE: I still have n't .
JANE: Are you and Agness still having sex ?
JAKE: Only if she initiates it .
JANE: Right . Yeah . Okay . Now I know you 're gon na think I 'm leaving because of what you just said , but I 'm not . I really have to get back to work .

JANE: mashed potatoes , sauteed string eans and double fudge chocolate cake . I know your favorite dinner , Jakey .
JAKE: You have n't called me Jakey in 10 years . This has been a great day for us . So , do we have a date ?

AGNESS: Carry him to his bed , will you ?
JAKE: You are ?
AGNESS: Why do you think I cancelled my dinner ?
LAUREN: Oh , Mom , I keep forgetting to tell you about our meeting at The Stanhope . We went there for lunch two days ago and met with thei Wedding Specialist.I think that could be the place , Mom .

LUKE: Mom , this looks amazing .
JAKE: Hi .
JANE: Hey .
JAKE: Where should I put this ?
JANE: Wherever .
JAKE: That looks incredible .

HARLEY: Jake ? Glass of wine ?
JAKE: Uh , sure . Thanks .
HARLEY: Jane ?
JANE: No thank you .
JAKE: Hi Ag Just got here .

JAKE: Janey , can I talk to you privately ? Just for a sec .
HARLEY: There you go . Somebody 's talkin ' graduation gift .
JANE: What is it , Jake ? What ?
JAKE: I do n't get not calling me back .
JANE: ` Cause I do n't care what you excuse is .
JAKE: She did n't go out , Jane . She cancelled her plans and every time I tried to call or write , she caught me . I wanted to be here .
JANE: You know what , Jake ? You were worried about rocking the boat at home ? Well now you 're rocking my oat and I do n't like it .
JAKE: Honey , do n't let one night
JANE: You do n't understand . I 'm not even laming you . I fully participated in this . But I do n't want to do it anymore . The last thing in the world I should be right now is you mistress , sitting around at nine at night wearing heels and perfume and lowing out candles and wrapping everything in Saran Wrap because your wife cancelled her plans . It was cliche and humiliating .
JAKE: You lit candles ?
JANE: Oh , shut up . Look , I 've had a pretty good life these past 10 years . I figured it out and I moved on . I no longer feel alone or divorced . I just feel normal . You know how long that took , just to get my balance back ?
JAKE: No .
JANE: The point is , I 'm going in the wrong direction here . But the worst part is It 's feeling like it used to feel . All the little untruths that are hard to catch but add up
JAKE: Janey , c'mon , it was one mistake
HARLEY: Everything okay out here ? The kids are gettin ' hungry
JANE: Yeah . We 're done . We were just
HARLEY: None of my beeswax , Jane . And please never tell me .
LAUREN: What 's up ?

LAUREN: Yeah ? So , we 're going to see you tomorrow night , for sure , right ?

HARLEY: Nothing . Really .
JANE: Have you told Lauren ?
HARLEY: No and I wo n't
LUKE: Mom . Dad 's leaving
JANE: Hey .
ADAM: Hey . You look fantastic .
JANE: I 'm feelin ' a little fantastic .
ADAM: This is for you .
JANE: Really ? Thank you ! Come on in . Can you hold this for a sec ? Oh my God this could be the best cake I ever made . You want a piece ? It 's like beyond
ADAM: I think I 'm good .
JANE: I ca n't believe you brought me a gift ? ! So nice !
ADAM: I sort of assumed you did n't have one .
JANE: Because I never remember our Awww .
ADAM: I took the liberty of filling in our next two meetings . And marked them with post-its and wrote them in red and then highlighted them in neon yellow .
JANE: Thank you !
ADAM: I 'm not . Wow , that cake is good .
JANE: So , let me ask you something and please do n't think I 'm weird or out of line or anything but do you y any chance poke smot ?

JANE: Oh my God , we have kids the same age ! And I have n't had any since my kids were born either ! ! ! Except for tonight . I had one hit off of this .
ADAM: You might not want to hold that quite so Hello Officer .
JANE: I actually know him ! Blueberry scone and a latte . Oh my God ! That was horrifying . I instantly saw myself in a mug shot . My heart is leaping out of my Wow This is the most insane dashboard I 've ever seen . It 's like we 're in a cockpit . It 's spectacular . Adam , what kind of car is this ?
ADAM: Jane ?
JANE: Hi .
ADAM: Did you get this high from one hit ?
JANE: Yes ! I do n't know what they 've done to pot over the last 30 years ut it rockkkkks !
ADAM: I have n't had fun in almost three years , Jane . Bring . It . On .

AGNESS: You know it 's hey , what are you gon na do ?
JAKE: Yeah , why go there .
JANE: Because there , isfascinating . I mean , when you think about it , it sort of links us in some cosmic crazy way , does n't it , Agness ? Of all the men on the planet , we both said `` I do '' to this guy .

JANE: What ? What am I , Jake ?
JAKE: You 're my ex-wife , lover , oldest friend and girlfriend .
JANE: Okay . You 're hilarious . And ecause of that , even though I kind of hate you/love you , I 'm going to let you have some
JAKE: You love me ? I mean , I heard `` hate '' had top billing , but
HARLEY: Oh my God , you 're smoking weed in the guest bathroom .
JAKE: Yes we are and we 'd appreciate it if you did n't tell anyone about this .
HARLEY: No . Never . Adding it to the list .
JANE: Care for a toke ?

JANE: I was sort of seeing someone . But , it 's over now . Honestly .
ADAM: ` Cause I 'm not strong enough to fall for someone who 's with someone else . Would n't be able to take that again .
JANE: I understand . I would n't say it was over if it was n't .
ADAM: Great .

LUKE: Mom , can Dad stay here for a few days ? He can share my room .
JANE: I do n't think that 's the best idea , Luke .

LUKE: Mom..
JAKE: Mommy 's the best cook in the world !
JANE: Jake , you knew the kids were all here . Should n't we have talked about this ? Agreed this was the ight thing to do ? This is so typical . Only thinking about works for you .
JAKE: I 'm sorry , I guess I should 've called before showing up .
JANE: And I 'm not sure you even left Agness . Maybe she saw something last night and threw you out
JAKE: What 's the difference ? I was drowning over there . I 'm not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out . Janey , let 's use these couple of days to see if we can make this work .
JANE: We ca n't , Jake . I told you this the other night . Please listen .
JAKE: But you were all pissy because you thought I stood you up . Things are different now . I 'm a free man . Can we just hug ? I hate that you 're being so distant . It 's literally giving me a pain in my stomach .
JANE: Oh , God
JAKE: Okay ! Good note .
JANE: I 'm fine .
JAKE: Okay I 'm going to go to the video store and get us all a dvd to watch tonight . We 'll have movie night . Just like old times . How 's that ? I 'll make the popcorn . Just then Jane 's Cell RINGS .

GABBY: So weird . Still is .

JAKE: What do you mean you were ten when we broke up .

JAKE: You do n't remember us in Hawaii o all sleeping in that tent in the ackyard .
LUKE: Yeah , of course , but I do n't emember like you and Mom hugging or waking up together
GABBY: Speak for yourself dude . I 'm definitely damaged from the divorce .
LAUREN: Hello troops .
JAKE: Why are you still here ?
LAUREN: I do n't know , you and Mom sleeping in the same house . Harley thought we should stay .
HARLEY: She exaggerates . I just thought perhaps you might want to talk later , or Is that the noodle thing ?
JAKE: Oh . Sorry . I think I ate it all .
GABBY: Dad !
JAKE: I did n't know anyone wanted any .
JANE: Wait , I ca n't see that one . Can you back up a little ?
ADAM: O-kay . Thank you . Gift from my ex-sister-in-law . Have no idea why I kept it . Into the pile . Hey , check out the pile , Jane .
JANE: Nice ! Hey , the pile 's moving .
ADAM: Murphy , get out of there !
JANE: And kinda girly .
ADAM: Not what I 'm going for . Gray sweater . Very old .
JANE: But cute .
ADAM: You sure ? You do n't have to say you like it just because you nixed the last 20 things .
JANE: Keep it . It 's cozy . Boy , you have a lot of clothes .
ADAM: Uh , not anymore . Okay , we 're almost done . You are helping me so much by the way .
JANE: Adam , I really have to pee .
ADAM: Oh good . Me too . Meet you back in thirty . Putting this on my desk .
JANE'S VOICE: I 'm not in there
ADAM'S VOICE: Ca n't hear you .
ADAM: Mother of Ahhhhhhhhhhh ! ! ! !
JANE: What are you doing in here ? ! ! !
ADAM: Get it off ! ! !
JAKE: I wanted to see you .
JANE: Why are you naked ! ? !
JAKE: Why do you think ?
ADAM: Okay , I 'm gon na be sick .
GABBY: Everybody okay ?
LAUREN: What 's happening ?
JAKE: Okay . Let me explain . The reason I left Agness was n't just because my marriage was n't working . I 've also fallen in loveback in love with your mother . Or maybe I never stopped loving her .
GABBY: Is this a joke ?
JAKE: I know this is shocking , but I think this is the best thing that 's ever happened to me . Your Mom and I have been seeing each other , on the side ever since New York .
LAUREN: Mom , is this true ?
JANE: That part is , but..
JAKE: I found my way back home . I just hope she 'll take me back .
LAUREN: Because we 're still getting ove the divorce .
LUKE: Mom , are you and Dad getting back together ?
JANE: No we 're not .
HARLEY: Glad you 're here , boss .
JANE: I got this one
HARLEY: I know you do .
JANE: Knowing how to be divorced is next to impossible and sometimes ove the years , I 've thought that you Dad and I were n't quite finished . And , as it turns out , we were n't . So I went out of my comfort zone , which , I found out , if you 're eally honest with yourself , is n't all that comforting . So , I experimented with a part of myself . I wanted to find out if , after all these years there was still something there between us .
LAUREN: And was there ?
JANE: There kinda was .
GABBY: But Mom , you have to understand how onkers this sounds to us . For two people who for years could n't be in the same room togetherto then have an affair ? ? ? You and Dad !
JANE: I knowit was hard for me and I was doing it . I hope you 'll forgive me for confusing you o etraying your trust , but I did this for me and for him and I ealized even though your Dad and I once had something extraordinary we no longer really fit together . But he is a part of me and always will be .
LUKE: So it 's over now ? You guys are ack to being divorced .
JANE: For better or for worse .
HARLEY: Group hug ?
ADAM: Yeah no problemwe can definitely do that James , can I call you back , someone just Thanks . Hi .
JANE: Hi . May I come in ?
ADAM: Sure .
JANE: I did n't call you last night ecause I was n't sure you would take the call and then I thought that could go on for months and
ADAM: I would have taken the call .
JANE: Oh . Well , anyway , it 's better to say these things in person . Adam , the man I was seeing was
ADAM: I think I 'm up to speed on that part .
JANE: I want you to know it did n't last long and you 're divorced , so maybe you understand , when marriages end , there 's doubts and hurt , and you 've got kids and sometimes you wonde if you did the right thing and when the moment presented itself
ADAM: I get it . I could imagine itI could
JANE: I told him it was n't going to work etween us but I guess he did n't elieve me and unbeknownst to me , he showed up at my house yesterday . He left Agness and
ADAM: Jane . I actually think I understand what happened utuhyou know I 'm not as macho as I appear and I think it 's probably best for us not to get any more involved because you elationship with Jake is n't really done and I know you 're saying it is , but he 's in love with you and for everyone 's sake , that should probably get resolved .
JANE: Wow . So that 's how grown ups talk .
ADAM: I was thinking of asking Peter to step back in .
JANE: Oh I hope you do n't
ADAM: Thanks .
JAKE: I 'm sorry .
JANE: How far back does that sorry go ?
JAKE: How far back do you need it to go ?
JANE: Way back .
JAKE: Consider it an all inclusive apology . From not being the husband you needed to showing up nude on your bed last night .
JANE: Yeah , what were you thinking with that move ?
JAKE: That you 'd find me irresistible .
JANE: Got ta love that about you .
JAKE: Oh , man , ca n't believe I got up to at again and blew it .
JANE: You did n't blow it . We blew it . We blew it the first time around . This time we just should 've known better . Too much has happened . Too much time has passed .
JAKE: And you do n't think we could make it right ?
JANE: Does that mean you did n't feel it was totally right either ?
JAKE: Being with you Jane is the best I 'm gon na be .
JANE: But do you agree that it was n't eally ?
JAKE: It was complicated .
JANE: Begging for an answer .
JAKE: I thought it was good . I wanted it to be good .
JANE: Guess that 's as close as I 'm gon na get .
JAKE: Do you always have to be so hard on me ?
JANE: No . I do n't .
JAKE: I do n't regret giving it anothe shot .
JANE: Probably would 've been better if you had n't been married .
JAKE: It may never have happened if I was n't married .
JANE: I do n't regret it either .
ADAM: Good morning .
JANE: Good morning .
ADAM: Did you know it 's good luck to start building in the rain ?
JANE: Really ?
ADAM: Yes . It 's a well known , very good , eally lucky omen .
JANE: Good , I could use one . Would you all like to have you meeting in the houseit 's dry and I 've got hot coffee
ADAM: Jane , I need to ask you something
JANE: Anything
ADAM: You would n't happen to have any of those amazing chocolate croissants , would you ?
JANE: Oh . you like those , huh ?
ADAM: I have incredibly fond memories of them .
JANE: I do n't have any here , but we could go into town and get some right out of the oven .
ADAM: You want to do that ?
JANE: Yeah love to . And as they walk away from Camera , we
CHARLIE: Lyle ?
LYLE: I 've got the orbital data and SV clock corrections for each satellite that gets the signal . That 'll make my reading as solid as the Precise Positioning Service that only the D.O.D . can use . We 're talkin ' 100 meter horizontal accuracy , 156 mete vertical accuracy , .340 nanoseconds time accuracy .
STEVE: Why ca n't he talk like a person ?
CHARLIE: Because he 's not .
LYLE: I do need one more thing , Charlie .
CHARLIE: What 's that ?
LYLE: Someone to turn the goddamn homing device on . No signal , no score .
CHARLIE: Where 're the Italians ?
STEVE: Patience .
HANDSOME ROB: What 's that shit ?
JOHN BRIDGER: Hi , sweetie .
STELLA: Daddy . How are you ?

STELLA: Really ? Does it smell nice ?
JOHN BRIDGER: No . But it 's sparkly .
STELLA: Does it come with a receipt ?
JOHN BRIDGER: I 'm having it sent to you from the store .
STELLA: Why not bring it by yourself ? We could have dinner .
JOHN BRIDGER: Be a long trip . I 'm in Genoa . She does n't like the sound of that .
STELLA: Let me guess . Checking out the irthplace of Christopher Columbus .
JOHN BRIDGER: Something like that .
STELLA: With your parole officer 's approval . He steps into the elevator . Rides up .
JOHN BRIDGER: I think I 've paid my P.O . my last visit . I liked the guy , but we neve eally connected .
STELLA: What are you into , Dad ? Do n't break my heart . You told me you were through .
JOHN BRIDGER: After this , I swear to you , I am .
STELLA: You promised me . Daddy , do n't do this .
JOHN BRIDGER: Everything 's going to be fine . I 've got to go now . I love you . Bye .
CHARLIE: Not yet .
STEVE: Do n't worry , they 'll come through . You can trust these guys .
JOHN BRIDGER: I trust everyone . It 's the devil inside them that I do n't trust . Got a sec ?
CHARLIE: My office .
JOHN BRIDGER: How you feeling , boss ?
CHARLIE: Fine . I 'm fine , fine . Bridger seems amused by that answer .
JOHN BRIDGER: You know what fine , stands for , do n't you ? Fucked-up , Insecure , Neurotic , and Emotional .
CHARLIE: You 've become quite the philosophe since you quit drinking .
JOHN BRIDGER: You do n't like me sober ?
CHARLIE: No , I 'm glad . Makes you a bette thief .
JOHN BRIDGER: For after the haul .
CHARLIE: Hope I get to fire it up . If Steve 's Italians are a no-show , it 's three months prep down the shitter and I 've dragged you out of retirement for nothing .
JOHN BRIDGER: This is kinda nice . You being the oss with all the worries , me just along for the ride .
CHARLIE: Ai n't you sweet From the other side of the door , they HEAR
STEVE: Yup . Dixie cups .
CHARLIE: Dixie cups ?
STEVE: I toss 'em away if there 's a problem down the road .
LYLE: For those about to rock , we salute you . Charlie dials his cell phone .
HANDSOME ROB: Yeah .
CHARLIE: Let 's get rich .
HANDSOME ROB: Can you chill out back there ? You 'd make a hummingbird nervous .
CHARLIE: Sweet Jesus .
JOHN BRIDGER: `` That for which all virtue is sold . And almost every vice gold . ''
THE CREW: Alright , John !
JOHN BRIDGER: You planned this one down to a t , kid . It 's a gift . You saw the big picture , made contingencies , covered the angles Hearing this , Steve looks a little jealous .
CHARLIE: You could 've . I had big shoes to fill .
JOHN BRIDGER: Fill the shoes but do n't follow the footprints .
CHARLIE: What 're you talking about ? You 've lived the life .
JOHN BRIDGER: My life 's been nothing but fake IDs , fake business cards and divorce papers . This is the only thing that 's eal .
CHARLIE: Stella 's a beautiful girl .
JOHN BRIDGER: She 's amazing . And I spent half he childhood in prison . This is a once in a lifetime haul , Charlie . Bring down the curtain after this one . Make a new life . Find someone amazing and be there for her . As the advice escapes Bridger 's mouth
HANDSOME ROB: Shit .
STEVE: Anyone acts stupid and his brains go on the windshield .
CHARLIE: What the hell do you think you 're doing ?
STEVE: Sorry Charlie . But I want the box of Cracker Jack all to myself .
CHARLIE: You 're not thinking this through . It 's a stupid move .
STEVE: Think so ? Well you 're the brilliant one . The Master Planner . Is n't that so , John ?
JOHN BRIDGER: We 'll hunt you down . You 're gon na egret this .
STEVE: No regrets , Dixie cup .
FIRST COP: You always work in the dark ?
STELLA: Buzz of the fluorescents throws me off . She 's all yours .
SECOND COP: Damn . Chris Perley could n't crack it . Neither could Michael Hoyt .
STELLA: Now you know who to call first .
FIRST COP: You 're expensive , Stella . Those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs . Goodwill , community service
STELLA: Well I do it for the money . I 'll send you the bill .
SECOND COP: Do n't you want to see what 's inside ?
STELLA: I never look . Bye , guys . And as she walks off , they do look at her .
RECEPTIONIST: How long ?
STELLA: Four minutes , forty-three seconds . High-five .
RECEPTIONIST: You 're the man .
STELLA: So what 's on the line-up ?
RECEPTIONIST: 2 00 . Home safe in Fairmount Park . Owner died and the wife never knew the combination . And Todd Milliken called . He has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning . Says he added two false contact points on the tumbler .
STELLA: Tell him if I do n't have it opened in six minutes flat , breakfast is on me .
RECEPTIONIST: And there 's a Charlie Croker in you office . He said you two know each other . And he looks pretty fine for a white oy . Without a response , Stella heads over to
STELLA: Charlie Croker . He turns around . Smiles . Charming .
CHARLIE: Hi , Stella . She steps inside .
STELLA: Refresh my memory . After you came to see me and told me what happened to my father , I told you I never wanted to see you again , did n't I ?
CHARLIE: Yeah . You did .
STELLA: So I 'm a little confused .
CHARLIE: I found him .
STELLA: I do n't want to know .
CHARLIE: Are you sure ? She does n't answer .
STELLA: When I was little he would play poke at the house and drop quarters unde the table for me to find .
CHARLIE: He got word from an L.A. connection named Skinny Pete that a gold deale has been buying bricks with the Balinese girl on them , three or fou at a time .
STELLA: You ever heard the expression , cut to the chase ?
CHARLIE: I tracked Steve down to an address in the Hollywood Hills . He 's changed his last name to Frezelli . And get this he had a Worthington 1000 installed in the house before he even moved in . We both know that you do n't install a Worthington 1000 unless you have something precious to guard .
STELLA: Precious or not , I do n't deal with ill-gotten goods .
CHARLIE: We boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it fo io-weapons . Now that does n't exactly make us Robin Hood , but maybe in ou own little way we were doing a good deed . Problem is , no one in my crew can handle that safe . And I need someone I can trust .
STELLA: And you think that 's me ? Have n't you heard that I work for the other side ?
CHARLIE: What I heard is that you have you father 's touch . And he was the only safecracker I knew who could open a Worthington 1000 .
STELLA: I 'm not a safecracker . I 'm a professional safe and vault technician .
CHARLIE: You 're John Bridger 's daughter . And this is our chance to set things ight . That sets her off .
STELLA: Our chance ? Who do you think you are coming in here ? Stealing the gold is n't going to bring my father back to life .
CHARLIE: No , it wo n't .
STELLA: Then get out .
HANDSOME ROB: How 'd it go with the chick ?
CHARLIE: I 'm working on it .
HANDSOME ROB: I do n't want her on the crew , Charlie .
CHARLIE: Got ta have her . Important piece of the puzzle .
HANDSOME ROB: There has to be someone else . What about Bill Huchins ?
CHARLIE: Doing ten long at Levinworth .
HANDSOME ROB: Red O'Reilly ?
CHARLIE: Chemo .
HANDSOME ROB: Martin Hernandez ?
CHARLIE: Found Jesus . Handsome Rob stops Charlie .
HANDSOME ROB: I do n't want a civilian to screw this up .
CHARLIE: She has the skill . And the motivation .
HANDSOME ROB: Exactly . She 's emotional . You know what happens when emotion gets into it .
CHARLIE: It 's emotional for all of us at this point . Do n't kid yourself .
RICHARD: It 's all in my patented sideways glance . Like this
STELLA: I see
RICHARD: The case is all but won . That 's why in jury selection I choose as many women as possible . Except lesbians , of course . I can tell in sixty seconds if they 're a lesbian . Want to know how I know ?
STELLA: If they do n't undress you with thei eyes ?
RICHARD: Precisely . Like that waitress right there . See ? She 's looking at me right elow my belt . Definitely not a lesbian .
STELLA: Your fly .
RICHARD: I am fly . And I 'm da bomb . Just wait until later tonight .
BUSBOY: Oh , man . I 'm sorry .
RICHARD: You should be . Moron . What the hell 's wrong with you ?
BUSBOY: It was an accident . I 'm very sorry .
RICHARD: Where 's the manager ? Richard Worth is not paying to have his suit cleaned . Damn . I 'm going to I do n't believe this .
CHARLIE: I think your date 's going pretty well , what do you think ?
STELLA: What are you doing here ?
CHARLIE: What do you mean ? I come here all the time .
STELLA: I do n't think so .
CHARLIE: Sure . Lawyers , Judges , my kind of crowd . See that gentleman there , he sentenced me to 90 days in county once . We need to talk .
STELLA: No , you need to listen . I want you to leave . Got it ?
CHARLIE: Hey , I paid valet parking prices to get in here , not to mention a twenty spot to the busboy to spill that drink on Mister Zipper .
STELLA: You I do n't believe this . You paid someone to spill that drink ?
CHARLIE: Actually , you paid for it . Charlie returns her wallet .
STELLA: You truly are a fatuous , odious man .
CHARLIE: I have no idea what you just said , ut I like the sound of it .
STELLA: Well maybe you 'll understand this . Hit the road , Jack
CHARLIE: Charlie
STELLA: Or you 'll be sorry , Charlie , cause I 'll kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels . She means it , too .
CHARLIE: I 'm beginning to worry about this whole relationship .
STELLA: I 'll let you in on a secret . You ca n't have a relationship with a pickpocket , gold robber , or any kind of thief .
CHARLIE: John was n't just a man I crewed up with , he was my friend , he was the closest thing to a father I eve had . I wish to God I could bring him ack . But all I can do is go afte this guy , the guy that killed him , and hit him where he lives .
RICHARD: Everything alright , Stella ? He 's back , red wine splotched on his suit .
STELLA: Fine . Richard . Charlie . Charlie was just saying goodbye .
RICHARD: Can I help you with something ?
CHARLIE: Oh , sorry . I was just undressing you with my eyes .
STELLA: I 'm in this for one thing , Charlie , and one thing only . I want to see the look on his face when his gold is gone . He took my father from me , I 'm taking this ; it 's the best I can do .
CHARLIE: I see Drive Defensively is your motto .
STELLA: Do n't worry . Jack Daniels never let me down . She slaps the dashboard of her car .
CHARLIE: By the way you drive , I 'm not surprised you named your car after a ottle of whiskey . Left .
STELLA: Jack Daniels was chief engineer of the Mini . And I drive it exactly the way it was meant to be driven . She whips down the avenue .
CHARLIE: Another left . She hangs a left .
STELLA: We 're going in circles . Who 's tailing you this week ?
CHARLIE: The possibilities are endless .
STELLA: Where are they ?
CHARLIE: We 're a little early . I did n't expect us to get here quite that fast . There
KID: That was rad !
CHARLIE: Handsome Rob . Premier wheel man . He once drove all the way to L.A. just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase .
STELLA: And what about you ?
CHARLIE: I 've been a thief since I had baby teeth .
BULLY: Cough it up , Charlie !
CLASSMATE: So much for lunch .
CHARLIE: This is Stella . She 's working with us on this one . IDs ?
LYLE: Melvin Lisp ? Could I just once have a cool name ?
HANDSOME ROB: Try 'Deal A Meal ' .
LYLE: I do n't even have a cool nickname .
CHARLIE: Enough of this sewing-circle shit . Phones .
LYLE: You still have n't told us the most important thing . What exactly is the job , Charlie ? And who exactly is she ?
CHARLIE: This is Stella Bridger . And we 're finishing the job that we started in Italy . They 're a little stunned at first .
LYLE: I 'll hack into the phone company 's central office remote observance monitoring system and fool it into thinking there 's a legal tap on the line . Reroute the digital copies of his calls to our own listening post .
CHARLIE: How long ?
LYLE: I 'll burn through the night , have it up and running before morning .
CHARLIE: We need to know how long to get from the house to Union Station downtown .
HANDSOME ROB: No problemo .
CHARLIE: Stella . How much time will you need with the safe ?
STELLA: I 'll have it open in five minutes flat .
HANDSOME ROB: It 's not the same as opening a safe for the cops . Your heart will be pounding in your ears . Perspiration on your fingertips . It 's a whole different ball game .
STELLA: You get me to the safe , I 'll open it .
LYLE: Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System . Monitors 132 points for intrusion , fire , and environmental hazards . Best way around it is to get a back door password , trip the alarm during the heist , then call it in as a false alarm .
CHARLIE: Housekeeper leaves at 17 30 .
YEVHEN: You 're right on time .
STEVE: Is the camera off ?
YEVHEN: Of course . Just like you said . I never tape you , you can see fo yourself .
HANDSOME ROB: Where 's a grenade launcher when you need one ?
CHARLIE: What 's your guesstimate ?
HANDSOME ROB: If we had all green lights , fourteen minutes . But in the twenty times I 've done it , the average is thirty- two minutes , with a top time of fifty minutes .
CHARLIE: Then we 'll travel like Rockefeller .
HANDSOME ROB: How do we get all green lights ?
CHARLIE: Lyle ?
LYLE: Let me see what I can do .
HANDSOME ROB: We still need an in to get the video lueprint .
LYLE: Carpet cleaners ? Gutter cleaners ? Flower delivery ?
CHARLIE: We 'll never get by the guard unless they 're certain it 's legit . I 'm thinking cable TV . We cut his cable , he calls the cable company . We show up . Send a cable technician into the house with a pinhole video camera while we get a feed through an RF antenna .
HANDSOME ROB: Who plays cable technician ? Steve thinks we 're all dead .
STELLA: If you 're all dead , I guess I 'm the man for the job .
CHARLIE: Are you up for it ?
STELLA: In for a penny , in for a pound .
LYLE: I 'm telling you . He claims he named it Napster because his hair is so nappy underneath that cap of his . But I know the real reason . It 's ecause I was NAPPING when he stole the idea from me . I should 've been on the cover of Wired magazine .
HANDSOME ROB: Would you clam up . You 'd give a woodpecker a headache .
LYLE: I 'm the Napster .
HANDSOME ROB: Okay . You 're the Napster . Heads up cable chick .
LYLE: Becky . Nice name . I wonder what she calls the other one .
HANDSOME ROB: And it 's such a mystery why you do n't have a girlfriend .
LYLE: I had a girlfriend . Unfortunately even though the relationship ceased in an objective reality , it 's still going on in my mind . That woman 's lived in here rent-free for four years . Lyle takes a few more pictures of Becky .
HANDSOME ROB: I have my doubts , but there 's no talking to Charlie .
LYLE: Maybe he 's been inserting his hard drive into her software . Clouds the judgment .
HANDSOME ROB: He knows better than to mix business with pleasure . Only I 'm allowed to do that .
LYLE: Where you going ?
HANDSOME ROB: To get a work shirt and a service truck .
SECURITY GUARD: What can I do for you , Miste Frezelli ?
STEVE: The cable 's out . See if you can get someone over here to fix it ' .
SECURITY GUARD: Yes , sir . He finds the number and dials .
LYLE: Whoa . I 've never heard the Muzak version of Purple Haze before .
CHARLIE: When 's the appointment ?
LYLE: Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Charlie dials a number on his cell phone .
SECURITY GUARD: Hello .
CHARLIE: Yes , I 'm calling from Adelphia Cable . I understand your service is out and an appointment was set up fo Thursday .
SECURITY GUARD: Yes .
CHARLIE: Well we have a technician working in your area who finished with an appointment earlier than expected . Will someone be there for the next hour ?
SECURITY GUARD: Sure . That 'd be great .
CHARLIE: Our technician will see you then . Have a nice day .
SECURITY GUARD: You too . Charlie hangs up .
CHARLIE: Let 's check the camera .
LYLE: Stella , you 're going patriotic today .
CHARLIE: He 's got cable lines in the kitchen , living room , bedroom and a cable modem on the computer in the office . Try to get a 360 look at each room . And walk slowly or the image will streak . Lyle hands her some papers .
LYLE: I printed these up to look like paperwork from Adelphia . When you 're done , ask him to sign and date the ottom . Stella looks very tense .
CHARLIE: How you doing ?
STELLA: Fine . I 'm fine . Charlie seems amused by that answer .
CHARLIE: You know what fine , stands for ? Fucked- up , Insecure Stella joins in with him
HANDSOME ROB: Girls girls girls .
BURLY MAN: Pays the rent , asshole . You got a problem , talk to Skinny Pete . He opens the door to the
SKINNY PETE: Philly Steak sent you ?
HANDSOME ROB: Should we hang here ? Check out the dancers ?
SKINNY PETE: Nothing 's going down here . I do n't shit in my own yard , do you ?
HANDSOME ROB: No , but I take a whizz off the deck sometimes .
SKINNY PETE: Five thousand dollars . And do n't be late .
STEVE: It 's all right . They wo n't bothe you now .
STELLA: It 's okay . I 'm used to running into all sorts of dogs on my job . He holds out a hand .
STEVE: I 'm Steve .
STELLA: Becky .
STEVE: Yeah . Course . This way .
STELLA: I 'd like to check the cable modem first .
STEVE: I 'll show you . They step into the
OFFICE: She turns her body so the mini-lens can stare at the gleaming black Worthington 1000 safe . Then she goes up to his desk and pretends to work on the cable line that feeds into his computer . He stares at her as she bends down
STEVE: The cable guy who hooked this up weighed about 300 pounds , did n't wear any underwear , and his pants slung a little too low if you know what I mean .
STELLA: There we go . Now onto the TVs .
STEVE: Is it fixed ?
STELLA: Turn it on and see .
STEVE: Perfect .
STELLA: Then it looks like you 're all set . Steve stares at her a moment .
STEVE: Have we met before ?
STELLA: I do n't think so . Sign here , please .
STEVE: You read my mind .
STELLA: Oh , no . I meant that I need you to put the date by your signature . It 's the 26th .
STEVE: I know what you meant . This might seem a little sudden , ut would you like to have dinne with me ?
STELLA: I do n't think that 'd be a very good idea .
STEVE: Why ? Is there some kind of cable- ule against dating customers ?
STELLA: No , it 's my rule . I do n't accept dates from men I 've just met . I 've only known you five minutes .
STEVE: Then I guess I 'll have to sabotage my cable over and over again until you get to know me better .
CHARLIE: I know it was tough in there .
STELLA: He touched my hand . And he came-on to me . That slimy , disgusting man came onto me and I had to pretend that I liked it .
CHARLIE: I know . When Steve leaves Friday night , we go in . By the time he ealizes you 've stood him up , we 'll e long gone with the gold .
HANDSOME ROB: The guy makes Jabba the Hut look like a spokesman for the Subway Sandwiches ' diet .
HOMEBOY: What 'd you put in the trunk ?
CHARLIE: Looks like that went without a hitch .
HANDSOME ROB: He only answers to The Napster now .
CHARLIE: I 'm not calling you The Napster .
LYLE: You call him Half-Ear .
CHARLIE: That 's only cause he is Handsome Rob .
LYLE: And I 'm The Napster .
CHARLIE: How far ? The Napster .
LYLE: Five hundred yards .
CHARLIE: So here 's the riddle . How do we get over a ton of gold from the vault to the getaway car ?
STELLA: How wide is the hallway ?
LYLE: Only six feet . OUR VIEW PUSHES IN FAST on Stella .
STELLA: Jack Daniels , straight up .
CHARLIE: Minis ?
STELLA: We could rumble right up the front steps , bring the getaway car right to the vault , and then straight to Union Station . Handsome Rob likes it .
HANDSOME ROB: We 'll need three to hold the gold .
COUNTER BABE: As long as it 's a convertible I always like to have my top down .
HANDSOME ROB: Never seen 'em before in my life .

YEVHEN: Of course . Believe me , he does n't want to be on video , either .
STEVE: Yevhen . Did n't I tell you , many times , that I never wanted to meet with anyone but you ? Yevhen sweats a bit .
YEVHEN: I know . But it 's his cash . He uses me to launder money . I 'm just a middleman .
STEVE: And a middleman is supposed to stay in the middle .
YEVHEN: But you were early . Please . Do n't worry . It will be fine . My cousin 's a cool guy . Like I am .

CHARLIE: How are our matchbox cars ?
HANDSOME ROB: Souped .
STELLA: Do n't let their size fool you . These were rally cars back in the day . 135 mph , 155 horsepower
LYLE: Do I get to drive one ?
HANDSOME ROB: No .
LYLE: Why not ?
HANDSOME ROB: Because you ca n't navigate your way out of a parking lot . Here 's you ide .
LYLE: But he ran into me .
HANDSOME ROB: He 's not driving either . You ever got a speeding ticket ?
STELLA: Let 's put it this way I can only get insurance through companies that advertise on TV at 3 00 in the morning .
HANDSOME ROB: You drive . I drive . Charlie drives .
CHARLIE: I got us spots for three cars on a car carrier and five first class seats . Train 59 from Union Station to New Orleans .
LYLE: The Traffic Control Center is on the top floor of a building on Olympic and Grand . They get their data from pavement loop detectors and video image vehicle detectors . That info is fused together by specially designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions and control the traffic lights . So all I have to do now is change the data by creating my own algorithm .
CHARLIE: What can I do to help ?
LYLE: I need to hard-wire into the mainframes .
CHARLIE: I have no idea what you 're doing . Just do it fast . There . He hits the ENTER button .
LYLE: We own this place .
MASHKOV: $ 2000 . And this is the new girl . Fresh off the bus . One of Danya 's guys picked her up hitchhiking downtown . The detective checks out the photo .
DETECTIVE: Those tits 'd make Dracula rise from his coffin at high-noon .
MASHKOV: They 're all yours Saturday . You can do whatever you want to her . He name is Karen
DETECTIVE: You 're too generous .
MASHKOV: I needed a fast answer .
DETECTIVE: And I 'm the Shell Answer Man . A guy who works the counter at your cousin 's shop told me that someone named Skinny Pete had been asking around about gold bricks with the face of a Balinese girl on them . Same gold icks your cousin was buying .
MASHKOV: You talked to this Skinny Pete ?
DETECTIVE: I thought you 'd want a shot at him first .
STELLA: You want the safe cracked , do n't you ?
CHARLIE: Yeah .
STELLA: Then I have to have perfect nails .
CHARLIE: Are you making this shit up ?
STELLA: I just let you in on a valuable trade secret .
LYLE: Charlie .
CHARLIE: Yeah ?
LYLE: Steve called to confirm a 7 30 eservation at Ago 's . And as fo your getaway , not even Rockefelle had it so good .
CHARLIE: Radio check .
HANDSOME ROB: Got cha , boss .
STELLA: Loud and clear .

STELLA: I know . I 've got a date tonight .
CHARLIE: You 'll have to fake it . Laugh at his jokes . You need him to ask you out again .
STELLA: You really make laugh .
STEVE: So here 's what I have lined up fo after dinner . We 'll go to Club Deep . The Ferrari always gets me to the front of the line . We 'll do a little dancing
STELLA: Not tonight . I do n't want to be out late .
STEVE: Why the curfew ?
STELLA: Let 's just say I 've made some wrong calls in the past . I like to take things slow , cautious . Next time
STEVE: I understand . You have nothing to worry about . You can trust me .
STELLA: I trust everyone . It 's the devil inside them that I do n't trust . That saying strikes Steve .
STEVE: That 's an interesting saying .
STELLA: What ? He looks at her closely , really closely .
STEVE: There 's only person I 've ever heard say that . Used to say it all the time .
STELLA: Who was that ?
STEVE: A man named John Bridger . Where did you pick up that phrase ?
STELLA: Ow . I do n't remember . You 're hurting me .
STEVE: John Bridger was a thief . And he had a daughter . About your age . He told me that she took over a safe and lock company that he used as a front .
STELLA: Let go of my wrist . What is wrong with you ? It 's just a saying .
STEVE: No wonder I liked you right away . Just like I liked your old man , right up until the moment I shot him in the head . Now tell me who you 're working with and tell me the plan . Do it now or we 'll go for a ride and I 'll break every bone in your body .
CHARLIE: Something wrong , Steve ? You look like you want to call Ghostbusters .
STEVE: Fine by me . But it 's you that has the problem .
LYLE: How do you figure ?
STEVE: You 've just blown the one thing you had going in your favor , the element of surprise . And I was surprised . Jesus Christ when I saw all you guys come out of the woodwork . For a minute I thought maybe you were ghosts . But you 're screwed now . Did you figure out how to take care of my security guard ? I 'll hire five more . You know how to bypass my alarm system ? I 'll have a new one installed tomorrow . Does it tear you up inside seeing what car I drive ? I 'll buy a matching one in red . You think you can crack my safe ? You 'll end up the same way as you dad . Looks like Good Time Charlie 's got the blues .
CHARLIE: You can wear that shit-eating grin on your face , but I know under that Versace shirt you 're in a cold sweat . And you 're not going to sleep a minute tonight . Cause you thought you 'd gotten away with it free and clear . You thought you 'd gotten rid of us . You 're the one who 's screwed . Right to the wall .
STEVE: Give it your best shot . I 'll outsmart you every step of the way . And this time , I 'll bury you myself .
CHARLIE: Get more guards . Change the alarm . Buy a dozen Ferraris . We 'll still be here . Sleep tight .
MASHKOV: Do you know who I am ?
SKINNY PETE: You work for Danya .
MASHKOV: Yes . And you are gon na be straight with me and everything 's gon na be okay . You fuck with me , I will be uthless .
SKINNY PETE: I understand .
MASHKOV: I do n't want you to understand . I want you to overstand .
SKINNY PETE: Overstand Okay .
MASHKOV: Because if you do n't overstand , I will use this .
LYLE: Well we scared him alright . He 's flying the coop . His security guard called Brink 's Armored Car Service to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his house , then JetClub to confirm a MD11 cargo plane departing from the Imperial Terminal at LAX at 8 p.m .
CHARLIE: Confirmed ? How 'd we miss the first calls ?
LYLE: They must have been cellular . The cargo plane is being chartered to Mexico City .
HANDSOME ROB: Only place with worse smog and traffic than L.A .
STELLA: Once the charter 's in the air , he could change the flight path to anywhere . And good-bye gold .
CHARLIE: Not so fast . This is good news fo us .
HANDSOME ROB: Good news ?
CHARLIE: Sometimes when you 're up to your ass in alligators you forget that you started off trying to drain the swamp .
HANDSOME ROB: Meaning what the fuck ?
CHARLIE: We 've been trying to get to the gold in the safe . Now the safe is coming to us . We 'll boost it in transit .
HANDSOME ROB: Charlie . He could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one . We ca n't take out an armored truck during ush hour .
CHARLIE: We 're already set to do it . Napster how would you like to create the iggest traffic jam in the history of Los Angeles ?
LYLE: Keep talking .
CHARLIE: You gridlock every route except the one we choose . Force the truck to go exactly where we want it to go .
HANDSOME ROB: But where do we want it ? We ca n't shoot it out with armed guards in a Brink 's . We 'd lose . And even if we pulled it off , the cops would be all over us , chasing us all the way to Union Station . We 're outmanned and outgunned .
CHARLIE: But not outsmarted .
PHILLY STEAK: Why 'd you do it ?
CHARLIE: Philly Steak . Do what ?
PHILLY STEAK: Yevhen . The Ukrainian gold , dealer . You did n't , have to clip him , fo Christ 's sakes .
CHARLIE: Clip him ?
PHILLY STEAK: Listen to me . You 've got ta get out of L.A. Now .
CHARLIE: What 're you talking about ? We did n't clip anybody .
PHILLY STEAK: Well Skinny Pete just called me . Yevhen 's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did .
CHARLIE: Why does he think that ?
PHILLY STEAK: Because you wanted , to know about the gold with the Balinese Girl . Plus I guess Pete was under duress . This Ukrainian thinks he 's Paul Fucking Bunyan .
CHARLIE: Do you know how to get in touch with him ?
PHILLY STEAK: Yeah but
CHARLIE: Maybe there 's a way we can play this to our advantage .
PHILLY STEAK: Are you out of your mind ? Listen to me , Charlie . Get out of L.A. Now . Cause if there 's one thing I know , it 's that you never mess with Mothe Nature , mother-in-laws , or mother- fucking Ukrainians .
MASHKOV: He 's going to be on Train 59 for New Orleans .
UKRAINIAN: You sure your source is good ?
MASHKOV: I 'm sure .

HANDSOME ROB: He 's brought in three identical armored trucks .
CHARLIE: Shit . Decoys . It 's like a shell game on wheels .
LYLE: How can I reroute the truck if I do n't know which truck to reroute ?
HANDSOME ROB: Three Brink 's trucks are leaving with motorcycle escorts , plus Steve in his Ferrari .
LYLE: How 're we going to figure out which truck has the gold ?
CHARLIE: You can monitor the traffic video cameras from your laptop , right ?
LYLE: Yeah .
CHARLIE: Where 's the first camera the trucks will go past ?
LYLE: Cahuenga Boulevard . They all have to cross that .
CHARLIE: The weight of the gold will lowe the suspension on the truck .
LYLE: Lines up with the top of the sign . Next
CHARLIE: Gridlock time .
CHRISTINA GRIEGO: This is Christina Griego with you drive-home traffic report on KNX . I 'm looking down on Hollywood Boulevard and this is definitely a CIG alert .

FURIOUS DRIVER: What 's wrong with you , you stupid- ass , son of a bitch , dickhead
LYLE: Where are you going ?
KAREN: Away .
LYLE: How about far , far away ?
KAREN: The farther the better .
CHARLIE: Going up ?
CHARLIE: I want to make a toast . Cause there 's somebody missing here today , and we all know who it is . They all raise their glasses .
MASHKOV: Take out your gun and drop it on the floor . Steve has no choice .
STEVE: Who are you ?
MASHKOV: You knew my cousin . Yevhen .
STEVE: I never knew anyone named Yevhen .
MASHKOV: Get in the trunk . Not that trunk , this one . That gold is for us . A gift from some old friends of yours . They said to tell you that they did n't mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack , as long as you did n't get any . Not even the toy surprise .
STEVE: Please . Do n't shoot me . Please
MASHKOV: Do n't worry . That was n't the deal . I 'm not going to shoot you .
STEVE: Thank you . Thank God .
MASHKOV: He really thought I was going to shoot him . The Ukrainians laugh . Steve tries to laugh .
CHARLIE: New IDs .
LYLE: Simon Quackenbush ? Could I just once have a cool name ?
CHARLIE: Did you get what you wanted ?
MASHKOV: I 'm happy .
CHARLIE: It was good doing business with you . Lyle hits a final command and
LYLE: Is this seat taken ?
KAREN: It is now .
CHARLIE: We did it .
STELLA: We sure did .
CHARLIE: There 's something I 've been meaning to ask you , Stella . But I 've just een so busy lately , what with the explosion , car chase , Ukrainians and all .
